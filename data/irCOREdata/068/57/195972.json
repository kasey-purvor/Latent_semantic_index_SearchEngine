In agree-\nment with previous observations, spectra from the lower E-\nregion have the single-peaked form characteristic of colli-\nsional plasma.

Ionosphere (active experiments; plasma waves\nand instabilities; polar ionosphere)\n1 Introduction\nAmong the most important phenomena associated with over-\ndense RF heating are the stimulation of non-propagating\nplasma density irregularities at the upper-hybrid height and\nthe excitation of Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves at the O-\nmode reflection height (e.g. Robinson, 1989; Rietveld et al.,\n1993; Kohl et al., 1993; Mishin et al., 2004). These ion-\nacoustic and Langmuir waves can be detected in the inter-\nCorrespondence to: R. S. Dhillon\n(rsd6@ion.le.ac.uk)\naction region by radars pointing in a wide range of direc-\ntions, including those close to the geomagnetic field direction\n(e.g. Stubbe et al., 1992; Kohl et al., 1993; Djuth et al., 1994;\nIsham et al., 1999; Honary et al., 1999; Rietveld et al., 2000;\nDhillon and Robinson, 2005). These wave modes give rise\nto enhancements in both the E- and F-region ion and plasma\nline incoherent scatter spectra. These spectral enhancements\nare thought to be caused by excitation of instabilities (Perkins\nand Kaw, 1971) that include the purely growing mode (Fejer\nand Leer, 1972), also called the oscillating two-stream insta-\nbility or modulational instability (Rietveld et al., 2002), and\nthe parametric decay instability (Fejer, 1979). These two in-\nstabilities were first observed using the HF heating facility\nat Arecibo (Carlson et al., 1972; Gordon and Carlson, 1974)\nas summarized in the review by Carlson and Duncan (1977).\nAmong other results, many observations of these phenom-\nena have been obtained using the EISCAT incoherent scatter\nradar systems (e.g. Stubbe et al., 1992; Kohl et al., 1993;\nStubbe, 1996) during RF heating experiments at Troms\u00f8.\nThe SPEAR system (a recent addition to the global ar-\nray of HF high-power facilities) began experimental oper-\nations in April 2004, when the first results using the high-\npower beam were obtained (Robinson et al., 2006). Since\nthen, further successful experimental campaigns have been\nundertaken, during which RF-induced enhancements in both\nfield-perpendicular and field-parallel scatter have been de-\ntected by coherent and incoherent scatter radars, respectively.\nField-parallel SPEAR-induced spectral modifications whose\ncharacteristics are consistent with excitation of the purely\ngrowing mode and the parametric decay instability have been\nobserved in the F-region by the EISCAT Svalbard UHF in-\ncoherent scatter radar system (Robinson et al., 2006). In\nthis paper, we add to these results by concentrating mainly\nupon enhancements in sporadic E-layers and restrict our at-\ntention to E- and F-region SPEAR-enhanced spectral data\naccumulated by the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR) during\nexperimental SPEAR\/ESR\/CUTLASS campaigns conducted\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1802 R. S. Dhillon et al.: SPEAR-enhanced E- and F-region ESR spectra\nin December 2004 and November\/December 2005. Heating\nof sporadic E-layers was first reported by Gordon and Carl-\nson (1976) using the Arecibo 430 MHz incoherent scatter\nradar. Further observations were obtained by Djuth (1984),\nduring typical daytime conditions as well as during intervals\nwhere sporadic E-layers were present, and Djuth and Gonza-\nles (1988), who studied the temporal evolution of enhanced\nplasma lines during heating of sporadic E-layers and found\nenhancements upshifted and downshifted from the transmit-\nter frequency by the heater frequency. Also, Schlegel et\nal. (1987) noted significant increases in the E-region ion line\nspectral power recorded by the EISCAT 933 MHz mainland\nUHF radar. More recently, Rietveld et al. (2002) presented\nRF-induced E- and F-region spectral enhancements that were\ndetected by both the UHF (operating at 931 MHz after reno-\nvation) and 224 MHz VHF EISCAT mainland radars. They\nconcluded that there was evidence consistent with E-region\nexcitation of the parametric decay instability and purely\ngrowing mode.\nIn Sect. 2 of this paper, the experimental configuration\nand certain technical aspects of the SPEAR system are de-\nscribed, together with the ESR. Section 3 will provide an\noverview of the experiments conducted in the SPEAR cam-\npaigns and a discussion of the results will be presented in\nSect. 4. Throughout this paper, repeated references will be\nmade to the paper by Robinson et al. (2006), where ini-\ntial observations of simultaneous SPEAR-enhanced coherent\nand incoherent scatter data are presented, and henceforth this\npublication will be referred to as R2006.\n2 Instrumentation\nSPEAR is a new combined HF high-power heater and coher-\nent scatter radar system (R2006; Wright et al., 2000) located\nin the vicinity of Longyearbyen (Spitzbergen in the Svalbard\narchipelago with a magnetic dip angle of approximately 8.5\ndegrees) and is designed to carry out a range of space plasma\ninvestigations of the polar ionosphere and magnetosphere.\nThe first results obtained using SPEAR have been presented\nin R2006. Full details of the SPEAR system, including tech-\nnical specifications and operating constraints, can be found\nin R2006. During the intervals covered here, SPEAR oper-\nated using the full 6\u00d74 array, transmitting O-mode-polarized\nradio waves in the field-aligned direction with a frequency of\n4.45 MHz and an effective radiated power (ERP) of approxi-\nmately 15 MW. The half-power beam width is approximately\n21 degrees.\nThe CUTLASS coherent scatter radars (Milan et al., 1997)\nwere also in operation during the experimental intervals pre-\nsented below. Both the Iceland and Finland radars ran an ex-\nperimental mode that used 15 km range gates on channel A\nand 45 km range gates on channel B, with beam 6 of Iceland\nand beam 9 of Finland overlooking the SPEAR site. Because\nof a combination of the frequency sweeps (11\u201313 MHz), in-\ntegration time (1 s) and beam sweeps (beams 3\u20135) that were\nused, the temporal resolution of the data from any specific\nrange-beam cell varied from 9\u201315 s. Further details of the\nCUTLASS operating modes utilized during the experiments\nare given in R2006.\nThe incoherent scatter radar data presented below were\nrecorded using the ESR (Wannberg et al., 1997), which is\ncollocated with SPEAR. The ESR, which operates at fre-\nquencies close to 500 MHz, was used to detect the Lang-\nmuir and ion-acoustic waves generated during the excita-\ntion of instabilities near the O-mode reflection height. Dur-\ning the December 2004 campaign, the ESR ran an experi-\nmental mode that used the fixed (field-aligned) 42 m dish\nto collect ion line data and the steerable 32 m dish (also\npointed field-aligned) to collect plasma line data. The ion\nline spectra were obtained on a channel with a transmitter\nfrequency of 499.9 MHz, The height discriminated ion line\nspectral data were obtained in two altitude ranges of 105\u2013\n210 km and 129\u2013757 km with range resolutions of 4.750 km\nand 14.250 km, respectively. The frequency resolutions\nof data from the two altitude ranges were 0.992 kHz and\n0.880 kHz, respectively, with the frequency ranges of both\nbeing \u00b131 kHz. The temporal resolution of the ion line data\nwas 6.4 s. Although plasma line data were also recorded on a\nseparate transmitter channel at a frequency of 500.3 MHz, no\nE-region plasma line spectral enhancements were detected\nbecause the excited E-region lay below the lowest altitude\nfrom which plasma line data were collected (150 km).\nDuring the December 2005 campaign, the ESR ran an ex-\nperimental mode that used the steerable 32 m dish (pointed\nfield-aligned) to collect both ion and plasma line data using\nlong pulses. The ion line spectra were obtained on two chan-\nnels with transmitter frequencies of 499.9 and 500.3 MHz.\nThe height-discriminated ion line spectral data for both chan-\nnels were obtained for an altitude range of 86\u2013481 km with\na range resolution of 28.226 km. The frequency resolutions\nof data from the two channels were 2.0 kHz with the fre-\nquency ranges of both being \u00b150 kHz. Only data from the\n499.9 MHz channel have been presented in this paper. The\nplasma line data were recorded on a separate channel with\na transmitter frequency of 500.1 MHz. Plasma line spectra\nwere obtained in two overlapping frequency bands of 3.2\u20134.8\nand 4.5\u20136.1 MHz both upshifted and downshifted from the\ntransmitter frequency. The plasma line data were obtained\nfor altitude ranges of 90\u2013315 and 240\u2013465 km, although in\nthis paper data are only shown from the 90\u2013315 km altitude\nrange, which includes the E-region. Because of the long\npulses used, together with a lack of data regarding the echo\nstrength versus range across the long pulse, the plasma line\ndata are not discriminated in altitude. The temporal resolu-\ntion of both the ion and the plasma line data was 5.0 s.\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1801\u20131814, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1801\/2007\/\nR. S. Dhillon et al.: SPEAR-enhanced E- and F-region ESR spectra 1803\n3 E- and F-region spear-enhanced incoherent scatter\ndata\nThis section covers observations of SPEAR-enhanced ion\nand plasma line spectra measured by the ESR and data\nfrom three intervals have been shown below. During 13:10\u2013\n13:42 UT on 10 December 2004 (interval 1), SPEAR trans-\nmitted an O-mode 4-min-on\/4-min-off cycle at 4.45 MHz\nand E- and F-region data from this interval are shown. Upper\nE-region data from 12:46\u201312:52 UT on 3 December 2005\n(interval 2) and lower E-region data from 15:14\u201315:20 UT\non 4 December 2005 (interval 3) are also shown. During in-\ntervals 2 and 3, SPEAR transmitted an O-mode 2-min-on\/2-\nmin-off cycle at 4.45 MHz. These data illustrate succinctly\nthe effects on the SPEAR-enhanced spectra of an ionosphere\nwith a well developed E-layer (interval 1), a relatively struc-\ntured ionosphere (interval 2) and an ionosphere with an ir-\nregular E-layer (interval 3). These ionospheric conditions\nwere deduced using ionograms, recorded using the Svalbard\nionosonde (R2006), which were taken during each of these\ndata intervals. Each of the ionograms, which are shown in\nFig. 1, was obtained when SPEAR was not transmitting.\nPanel (a) shows an ionogram taken at 13:26 UT on 10 De-\ncember 2004 (interval 1). This shows clearly a blanketing\nsporadic E-layer that affects O-mode waves with frequencies\nfrom 2\u201310 MHz. There is also evidence of second-hop scat-\nter from approximately 4\u20139 MHz. Panel (b) shows an iono-\ngram recorded at 12:50 UT on 3 December 2005 (interval 2).\nThis ionogram shows evidence of structure in the ionosphere\nand has features consistent with the presence of E- and F-\nlayers. Panel (c) shows an ionogram obtained at 15:18 UT on\n4 December 2005 (interval 3). This ionogram is suggestive of\nan irregular E-layer that interacts with radio waves that have\nfrequencies in the range of about 2\u20137 MHz. The sporadic E-\nlayer echoes exhibit an altitude extension of about 20 km at\nfrequencies between 3 and 6 MHz. Although the altitude res-\nolution in the ionograms is 6 km, the extended altitude range\nmay be caused by the oblique nature of some of the echoes\ndetected by the ionosonde receiver\/processing system.\nThe CUTLASS Finland and Iceland radars were operat-\ning during the three data intervals and they collected data,\nwhich are shown in Fig. 2, using the scanning mode that\nwas described in Sect. 2. The three labelled rows of pan-\nels correspond to intervals 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The\ncolumns of panels, from left to right, correspond to data from\nFinland Channel A, Finland Channel B, Iceland Channel A\nand Iceland Channel B. The Finland data were taken using\nbeam 9 and the Iceland data with beam 6 (see Sect. 2). The\nhorizontal black bars in each of the panels indicate when\nSPEAR was transmitting, with the vertical dashed lines de-\nnoting the SPEAR switch-on and switch-off times. Fin-\nland channel B data for interval 1 are missing and therefore\nno data are shown in this panel. Clearly, definite SPEAR-\nenhanced CUTLASS backscatter was only observed during\n12:48\u201312:50 UT on 3 December 2005 (within interval 2) by\na\nb\nc\nFig. 1.

There is also evidence of second-hop\nscatter from approximately 4\u20139 MHz. Panel (b) shows an ionogram\nrecorded at 12:50 UT on 3 December 2005 (interval 2) in a rel-\natively structured ionosphere that has features consistent with an\nF-region layer. Panel (c) shows an ionogram obtained at 15:18 UT\non 4 December 2005 (interval 3) in an ionosphere with an irregu-\nlar E-layer that affects O-mode waves with frequencies from about\n2\u20137 MHz.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1801\/2007\/ Ann.

We shall return to these results later in the\ndiscussion given in Sect. 4.\nWe turn now to ESR incoherent scatter radar data, shown\nin Figs. 3, 4 and 5, which correspond to intervals 1, 2 and\n3, respectively. Figures 3, 4 and 5 all contain panels that\nshow time series of ion and plasma line amplitudes. In\nall such panels horizontal black bars denote the period or\nperiods during which SPEAR was transmitting. Also, the\ndashed horizontal lines give the mean ion or plasma line am-\nplitude during the particular SPEAR-on or SPEAR-off in-\nterval in which they occur. Figure 3 shows ion line data\nfrom interval 1 (10 December 2004, 13:10\u201313:42 UT), dur-\ning which SPEAR was switched on at 13:12, 13:20, 13:28\nand 13:36 UT. Panels (a) and (b) show E-region data. Panel\n(a) shows averaged spectra from an altitude range of 110\u2013\n120 km. The solid and dashed lines correspond to SPEAR-on\n(13:28\u201313:32 UT) and SPEAR-off (13:32\u201313:36 UT) inter-\nvals, respectively. The single central peak in the spectrum is\nindicative of collisional plasma and there is a clear increase\nin its amplitude during the SPEAR-on period. This is con-\nsistent with previous observations of HF-enhanced E-region\nion line spectra (e.g. Rietveld et al., 2002). Panel (b) shows\nthe amplitude of the central (0 kHz) ion line (110\u2013120 km)\nfor 13:10\u201313:42 UT. The SPEAR-induced spectral enhance-\nment is generally present throughout the SPEAR-on periods,\nwith its amplitude, although variable, typically being an or-\nder of magnitude larger during SPEAR-on than SPEAR-off.\nIonograms taken at around 13:40 UT (not shown), in which\nthe signature of the E-layer is not as pronounced, indicate\nthat the sporadic E-layer has weakened and this is consistent\nwith the lower (SPEAR-induced and natural) ion line ampli-\ntudes seen at this time.\nPanels (c\u2013f) of Fig. 3 show F-region (160\u2013220 km) ion line\nenhancements corresponding to the E-region enhancements\nshown in panels (a) and (b). SPEAR-induced spectral en-\nhancements were found to occur within the altitude range\nof 160\u2013220 km. Panel (c) shows averaged ion line spectra\nfor SPEAR-on and SPEAR-off.

The E-region\nspectral enhancement, characterized by a clear increase in the ion line amplitude for SPEAR-on compared to SPEAR-off, is consistent with\nexcitation of collisional plasma. The spectral enhancements in the F-region are not as distinct as those for the E-region and are consistent\nwith a high proportion of the pump wave energy being deposited in the sporadic E-layer.\ndenoted by the dashed line, the spectrum has the usual form\nof an F-region ion line spectrum, with two ion-acoustic peaks\nwhose separation is related to the plasma temperature. The\nspectrum for SPEAR-on (solid line) has enhancements in the\ncentral peak, corresponding to the purely growing mode, and\nthe ion-acoustic peaks, corresponding to the parametric de-\ncay instability. The asymmetry of the spectrum contrasts\nwith the high degree of symmetry seen in previous SPEAR-\nenhanced F-region ion line spectra (R2006), which were ob-\ntained when no significant E-region was present. Unsurpris-\ningly, this asymmetry does not have the form of previous\nasymmetries that have been attributed to the parametric de-\ncay instability (Stubbe et al., 1992). We shall return to and\nfurther discuss these F-region ion line spectral asymmetries\nlater in this section.\nPanels (d\u2013f) show the amplitudes of the upshifted ion line\npeak (UIL) (d), the central part of the spectrum (CIL) (e), and\nthe downshifted ion line peak (DIL) (f). The ion line data\nhave been presented in this format because the variability in\nthe amplitudes, and hence the action of the purely growing\nmode or the parametric decay instability, can be monitored.\nClearly, changes in the CIL amplitude generally occur si-\nmultaneously with changes in the DIL and UIL amplitudes.\nThe separation of the ion-acoustic peaks during the SPEAR-\non periods remains unchanged, which implies no change in\nthe electron temperature during SPEAR-on. Clearly, the E-\nregion CIL amplitude varied appreciably during the SPEAR-\non periods, as shown in panel (b), and this is accompanied by\nconsiderable variability in the F-region ion line amplitude.\nThere is not a clear demarcation in amplitude between the\ntimes when SPEAR was transmitting and those times when\nit was not, with the possible exception of 13:28\u201313:32 UT\nwhere the amplitude of all three spectral components is in-\ncreased by approximately a factor of two compared to the\namplitude for SPEAR-off.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1801\/2007\/ Ann.

Panels (a\u2013f) show upper E-\/lower\nF-region (140\u2013170 km) spectral data for 12:46-12:52 UT on 3 December 2005 (interval 2). Averaged ion line spectra for SPEAR-on and\nSPEAR-off are shown in panel (a), while panels (b\u2013d) show upshifted (b), central (c) and downshifted (d) ion line amplitudes. Panels (e) and\n(f) show upshifted (e) and downshifted (f) plasma line amplitudes. SPEAR was transmitting from 12:48\u201312:50 UT and well correlated ion\nand plasma line enhancements are present at the beginning and the end of the SPEAR-on interval. Noticeable enhancements are also present\nin the plasma line data at approximately 12:49:00 and 12:49:30 UT. However, these enhancements do not have obvious ion line counterparts.\nFigure 4 shows ion and plasma line data from interval 2 (3\nDecember 2005, 12:46\u201312:52 UT). The data originate from\nan altitude range of 140\u2013170 km, which corresponds to the\nupper E- and lower F-regions. Panel (a) shows averaged ion\nline spectra for SPEAR-on (12:48\u201312:50 UT, given by the\nsolid line) and SPEAR-off (12:50\u201312:52 UT, given by the\ndashed line). As above, the SPEAR-off spectrum has the\nusual form of an F-region ion line spectrum with two ion-\nacoustic peaks. The enhancements in the central part and\nion-acoustic peaks of the SPEAR-on spectrum are consis-\ntent with SPEAR-induced instabilities and are similar to the\nSPEAR-induced F-region enhancements reported in R2006.\nPanels (b)-(d) show the amplitudes of the UIL (b), the CIL\n(c), and the DIL (d) for 12:46\u201312:52 UT, with SPEAR trans-\nmitting from 12:48\u201312:50 UT. As stated above, the ion line\ndata allow us to monitor the action of the purely growing\nmode and the parametric decay instability. Changes in the\nCIL amplitude are generally well correlated with changes in\nthe UIL and DIL amplitudes. Also, the amplitudes of all\nthree spectral components towards the beginning and the end\nof the SPEAR-on interval are at least an order of magnitude\nhigher than during the rest of the SPEAR-on interval. The\namplitude increases at the beginning of the SPEAR-on in-\nterval are characteristic of the commonly seen ion line over-\nshoot, which has generally been absent from previous obser-\nvations of SPEAR-enhanced data (R2006). Increases simi-\nlar to those at the end of the SPEAR-on interval have been\nseen previously and will be discussed further in Sect. 4. The\nion line amplitudes during the rest of the SPEAR-on interval\nare comparable to those during the SPEAR-off periods. Pan-\nels (e) and (f) show the amplitudes of the upshifted (UPL)\n(e) and downshifted (DPL) (f) plasma lines (at \u00b14.45 MHz)\nfor 12:46-12:52 UT. The SPEAR-induced UPL and DPL en-\nhancements are clearly well correlated, both with each other\nand with the ion line enhancements. Also, the UPL and DPL\namplitude increases at the beginning of the SPEAR-on in-\nterval are consistent with the plasma line overshoot. As for\nion line data, increases at the end of the SPEAR-on interval\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1801\u20131814, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1801\/2007\/\nR. S.

Ion and plasma line spectra and amplitudes, for the lower E-region, from 4 December 2005. Panels (a\u2013d) show upper D-\/lower\nE-region (80\u2013110 km) spectral data for 15:14\u201315:20 UT on 4 December 2005 (interval 3). Averaged ion line spectra for SPEAR-on and\nSPEAR-off are shown in panel (a). Panel (b) shows the central ion line amplitude, while panels (c) and (d) show the upshifted (c) and\ndownshifted (d) plasma line amplitudes. SPEAR was transmitting from 15:16\u201315:18 UT and there is an increase in the ion and plasma line\namplitudes at the beginning of the SPEAR-on interval. As for the E-region data from 10 December 2004, these lower E-region spectral\nenhancements are consistent with excitation of collisional plasma.\nhave been seen previously (see Sect. 4). Incidentally, the\nplasma line enhancements just after 12:48 UT are among the\nstrongest yet seen during all periods that SPEAR has been\noperating. There are also intermittent plasma line enhance-\nments at around 12:49:00 UT and 12:49:30 UT.\nFigure 5 shows ion and plasma line data from interval 3 (4\nDecember 2005, 15:14\u201315:20 UT). The data originate from\nan altitude range of 80\u2013110 km, which corresponds to the\nupper D- and lower E-regions. Panel (a) shows averaged ion\nline spectra for SPEAR-on (15:16\u201315:18 UT, given by the\nsolid line) and SPEAR-off (15:18\u201315:20 UT, given by the\ndashed line). As for SPEAR-off data from interval 1, there\nis a single central peak in the ion line spectrum, which iden-\ntifies collisional plasma. As mentioned above, increases in\nits amplitude have been observed previously (e.g. Rietveld\net al., 2002). Panel (b) shows the CIL amplitude for 15:14\u2013\n15:20 UT. Clearly, the amplitude is highly variable during\nthe SPEAR-on times, with the spectral enhancement being\ngreatest from about 15:16\u201315:17 UT. Panels (c) and (d) show\nthe UPL (c) and DPL (d) amplitudes (at \u00b14.45 MHz) for\n15:14\u201315:20 UT. The SPEAR-induced UPL and DPL en-\nhancements, which appear at just after switch-on (at 15:16\nUT) and last for about 30 s, are clearly well correlated with\neach other. Unlike previously seen RF-induced signatures of\nthe overshoot, where the spectral enhancement disappears af-\nter switch-on of the high-power beam (usually after one data\ndump), the SPEAR-induced enhancements here (and also in-\ncidentally in the apparent overshoot data in interval 2) persist\nfor longer. Also, insufficient plasma line resolution made it\nimpossible to differentiate between the actions of the para-\nmetric decay instability and the purely growing mode during\nSPEAR-on. There are no identifiable SPEAR-induced ion or\nplasma line enhancements during the rest of the SPEAR-on\ninterval.\nWe return now to the E- and F-region spectra from in-\nterval 1 (13:10\u201313:42 UT on 10 December 2004). In order\nto highlight the variability in these spectra, we now concen-\ntrate on data taken during the 4-min-on period from 13:28\u2013\n13:32 UT. E-region data are shown in Fig. 6 and we consider\nthese first. The figure shows ion line spectra taken during\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1801\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 1801\u20131814, 2007\n1808 R. S. Dhillon et al.: SPEAR-enhanced E- and F-region ESR spectra\nboth SPEAR-on and SPEAR-off. Each panel in the figure\nshows an ion line spectrum with the x-, y- and z-axes show-\ning frequency, altitude and amplitude, respectively. The pan-\nels in Fig. 6 are presented in chronological order with the\ntime above each panel corresponding to the end of the par-\nticular 6.4 s integration period (with the fractional second be-\ning discarded) during which the ion line data were recorded.\nThe black circles above a number of the panels denote com-\nplete integration periods during which SPEAR was transmit-\nting. Although the amplitudes of these E-region spectra vary\nduring the 4-min-on period, with a notable reduction present\naround 13:29:30 UT, the form of the spectral enhancements,\ncharacterized by an increase in the central peak amplitude,\nis a consistent feature of all the SPEAR-on spectra. Figure 7\nshows F-region spectra corresponding to the E-region spectra\ndisplayed in Fig. 6. Each panel in Fig. 7, as for Fig. 6, shows\nthe frequency, altitude and amplitude plotted using the x-, y-\nand z-axes. The times of the F-region spectra, shown above\nthe panels, correspond to the times of the E-region spectra.\nClearly, these F-region spectra have a considerable degree\nof variability, with the forms of the SPEAR-enhanced spec-\ntra (which are present at altitudes between 160 and 220 km)\nchanging throughout the SPEAR-on interval. Furthermore,\nthe spectra are all generally asymmetric, with the number and\npositions of identifiable peaks changing over time. Some of\nthese peaks occur in the central part of the ion line spectrum\nand at the ion-acoustic frequencies and such SPEAR-induced\nspectral enhancements have been identified with the actions\nof the purely growing mode and the parametric decay insta-\nbility, respectively (R2006). Also, an interesting feature is\nthat the most significant F-region spectral enhancements oc-\ncur concurrently with the highest increases in the E-region\nspectral amplitude.\n4 Discussion\nIn this study, we have provided ESR observations of the tem-\nporal evolution of E- and F-region ion and plasma line spec-\ntral enhancements caused by the interaction of the SPEAR\nhigh-power pump wave with sporadic E-layers. We have pre-\nsented evidence of corresponding E- and F-region SPEAR-\ninduced ESR ion line spectral enhancements during the pres-\nence of a non-blanketing porous sporadic E-layer. These\nresults constitute the first observations of SPEAR-enhanced\nE-region ion line spectra and were obtained during the De-\ncember 2004 experimental campaign. However, no accom-\npanying E-region plasma line enhancements were observed,\nalthough the absence of such observations can be explained\nby recalling that the enhancements occurred at altitudes too\nlow for plasma line data to be collected. However, the lack of\nF-region plasma line data is more difficult to explain as pre-\nvious F-region SPEAR-induced ion line enhancements have\nbeen accompanied by corresponding plasma line enhance-\nments. Generally simultaneous SPEAR-induced E-region\nion and plasma line spectral enhancements were first seen\nin ion and plasma line data collected during the December\n2005 campaign. Simultaneous E-region ion and plasma line\nenhancements were seen in data from two intervals, the first\nof which contained upper E-region enhancements, with the\nother containing lower E-region enhancements while a spo-\nradic E-layer was present. Upper F-region spectral enhance-\nments were not seen during these two intervals from Decem-\nber 2005. The lower E-region data were obtained when a\nsporadic E-layer was present and have the same characteris-\ntics as those of the E-region data from the December 2004\ncampaign.\nIon line data from interval 1 (10 December 2004) include\nE-region amplitude enhancements in the central (0 kHz)\nspectral component and F-region amplitude enhancements in\nboth the ion-acoustic peaks and the central part of the ion\nline spectrum. Unlike previous SPEAR-enhanced F-region\nion line data where plasma line enhancements were also ob-\nserved (R2006) no F-region plasma line enhancements were\nseen in data from interval 1. Also, any enhancements in the\nE-region plasma line spectrum were not recorded as they\nwould have occurred below the lowest altitude from which\nplasma line data were collected (150 km). For the well de-\nveloped porous sporadic E-layers in this interval, the strong\nE-region enhancements indicate that a high proportion of the\ntransmitted pump wave energy excited instabilities in the E-\nregion. Also, the porous nature of the sporadic E-layer prob-\nably led to intermittent excitation of the F-region, thereby\ncausing highly variable F-region ion line amplitudes. For\nexample, the presence of the F-region spectrum for 13:28\u2013\n13:32 UT (shown in panel (d) of Fig. 2), which in this case\nhappens to be asymmetric (because of variable spectral forms\nin the 4-min SPEAR-on interval), is consistent with patchy\nE-region plasma that is in frequent motion during SPEAR-\non. The variability of the E- and F-region spectra collected\nduring this 4-min interval may be seen clearly in the data\npresented in Figs. 6 and 7. As mentioned above, the F-region\nspectra, shown in Fig. 7, are generally irregular and asym-\nmetric and their form varies from data dump to data dump\nover the period that SPEAR is transmitting. This is indicative\nof highly variable density-dependent absorption within and\npenetration through the sporadic E-layer during the SPEAR-\non period. As mentioned in R2006, the variability in the\nplasma density leads to strong local fluctuations in the elec-\ntric field strength of the high-power wave. Therefore, the\nthreshold electric fields necessary for instability excitation\nwill only be exceeded intermittently and for short periods\nduring the SPEAR-on interval.\nIt is clear from Figs. 6 and 7 that the most significant E-\nand F-region spectral enhancements tend to occur simulta-\nneously. This concurrence of high E- and F-region SPEAR-\nenhanced spectra is surprising as there is not thought to be\na correlation between the presence of sporadic E-layers, for\nwhich the density enhancements are localized in altitude, and\nhigh densities in the F-region.

Successive E-region ion line spectra from approximately 13:27\u201313:33 UT on 10 December 2004 (within interval 1). Each panel\nshows an ion line spectrum with the x-, y- and z-axes showing frequency, altitude and amplitude, respectively. The panels are presented in\nchronological order and cover two time periods during which SPEAR was switched off, separated by the 4-min interval during which SPEAR\nwas switched on (13:28\u201313:32 UT). The time above each panel corresponds to the end of the particular 6.4-s integration period during which\nthe ion line data were recorded. These times have been shown with the fractional second being discarded. The black circles above a number\nof the panels denote complete integration periods during which SPEAR was transmitting. Clearly, the amplitudes of these E-region spectra\nvary during the 4-min-on period, with a notable reduction present around 13:29:30 UT. However, the form of the spectral enhancements is\ncharacterized by an increase in the central peak amplitude during SPEAR-on. This is a consistent feature of all the SPEAR-on spectra and\nmay be used to differentiate these spectra from those for SPEAR-off.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1801\/2007\/ Ann.

F-region spectra corresponding to the E-region spectra displayed in Fig. 6, i.e. for approximately 13:27\u201313:33 UT on 10 December\n2004. As for Fig. 6, each panel shows the frequency, altitude and amplitude plotted using the x-, y- and z-axes. The times shown above the\npanels of F-region spectra correspond exactly to the times of the E-region spectra. Once again, the black circles above a number of the panels\nlabel complete integration periods during which SPEAR was switched on. Clearly, these F-region spectra have a considerable degree of\nvariability, with the forms of the SPEAR-enhanced spectra (which are present at altitudes between 160 and 220 km) changing throughout the\nSPEAR-on interval. Furthermore, the spectra are all generally asymmetric, with the number and positions of identifiable peaks changing over\ntime. Some of these peaks occur in the central part of the ion line spectrum and at the ion-acoustic frequencies. Also, the most significant\nF-region spectral enhancements occur concurrently with the highest increases in the E-region spectral amplitude.\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1801\u20131814, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1801\/2007\/\nR. S. Dhillon et al.: SPEAR-enhanced E- and F-region ESR spectra 1811\nsporadic E-layer is high, then this implies that the majority of\nthe high-power wave energy ought to be absorbed or reflected\nin the E-region, with little to progress to the F-region. How-\never, any RF energy that does manage to penetrate the patchy\nsporadic E-layer is free to propagate to the F-region, where,\nfor sufficiently high F-region plasma density, it can excite the\ninstabilities that enhance the F-region spectra. This hypoth-\nesis is consistent with our data as the presence of F-region\nspectral enhancements indicates that a significant proportion\nof the RF energy penetrated the sporadic E-region and prop-\nagated through to the F-region, in which, presumably, the\nplasma density was sufficiently high throughout the interval.\nThe data from interval 2 (3 December 2005) contain up-\nper E-\/lower F-region enhancements in the amplitudes of\nboth the central part of the ion line spectrum and of the\nion-acoustic peaks, the separation of which is related to\nthe plasma temperature. In F-region collisionless plasma\nlocated well away from the collisional E-region, the ion-\nacoustic peaks in ESR ion line spectra, which are recorded\nusing transmission frequencies of 500 MHz, usually appear\nat about \u00b15 kHz (R2006). However, for these data (upper\nE-\/lower F-region) the peaks are at approximately \u00b12 kHz.\nThis reduced peak separation is a consequence of the in-\ncreasing ion-neutral collision frequency, for decreasing al-\ntitude, from the collisionless conditions that obtain in the up-\nper F-region, to the lower E-region collisional regime. The\nion line enhancements, which were accompanied by simul-\ntaneous enhancements in both the upshifted and downshifted\nplasma lines, imply that both the parametric decay instabil-\nity and purely growing mode were operating. This is con-\nsistent with previous SPEAR-enhanced F-region data where\nsimultaneous ion and plasma line enhancements were also\nobserved (R2006).\nThere is evidence of overshoot phenomena in the ion\nand plasma line data from interval 2 at SPEAR switch-\non. Features that could be characterized as overshoots\nhave only been observed occasionally in SPEAR-enhanced\ndata, and this lack of observation has been attributed to the\nlower power (15 MW) transmitted by SPEAR (R2006). On\nthe other hand, the overshoot is seen frequently in heater-\nenhanced Troms\u00f8 incoherent scatter data, where much higher\npowers (several hundred MW) are available with the Troms\u00f8\nheater (Rietveld et al., 1993). In addition to clear amplitude\nincreases at SPEAR switch-on, there are also increases to-\nwards the end of the SPEAR-on interval. Although such\nion and plasma line amplitude increases have been observed\npreviously in SPEAR-enhanced ESR data (e.g. Fig. 17 in\nR2006), there have usually been additional amplitude en-\nhancements during the rest of the SPEAR-on interval. How-\never, our observations do not contain significant ion line en-\nhancements during the rest of this SPEAR-on interval, al-\nthough plasma line enhancements are present. Substantial\nion line enhancements only occur at around the time when\nSPEAR is switched off. While initial inspection of the data\nsuggests that these signatures may provide evidence of en-\nhancements associated with SPEAR switch-off, closer ex-\namination reveals that these increases appear to be purely\ncoincidental, as they actually occur before and die away at\nSPEAR-off.\nAs for the E-region data from interval 1, the upper D-\n\/lower E-region ion line spectra from interval 3 (4 December\n2005) have a single central (0 kHz) peak, indicating colli-\nsional plasma, rather than a pair of ion-acoustic peaks. The\neffect of SPEAR was identified by an increase in the ampli-\ntude of this central peak and this is consistent with the ac-\ntion of the purely growing mode and\/or the parametric decay\ninstability (Rietveld et al., 2002). However, in contrast to\nthe interval 1 data, these ion line enhancements were accom-\npanied by plasma line enhancements (upshifted and down-\nshifted by the SPEAR transmission frequency of 4.45 MHz),\nwhich lasted for about 30 s after SPEAR switch-on, and these\nalso indicate excitation of either or both instabilities. Previ-\nous SPEAR-induced ion and plasma line enhancements have\ntended to occur simultaneously (R2006), and this may also\nbe the case here, although there is a degree of variability in\nthe ion line amplitude during the SPEAR-on interval which\nmakes it difficult to associate unambiguously any ion line\namplitude increases with the action of SPEAR.\nThe data from all three intervals are consistent with the\nSPEAR-affected region of ionosphere being traversed by\npatches of overdense plasma, giving rise to varying ion and\nplasma line amplitudes in both the E- and F-regions (R2006).\nThis patchiness results in intermittent blanketing of the F-\nregion, during which the transmitted pump wave interacts\nwith the sporadic E-layer. When the pump wave does not en-\ncounter E-region plasma, it is free to propagate to and excite\ninstabilities within the F-region, thereby further increasing\nthe variability of the F-region ion and plasma line signatures.\nThis variability is clear in data from interval 1, which indi-\ncate patches present during most SPEAR-on intervals. For\ninterval 2 data, ion and plasma line enhancements indicate\nthat patches were present at the beginning and near the end\nof the SPEAR-on interval. Such enhancements indicating\npropagating patches were also present at the beginning of the\nSPEAR-on period in interval 3, but generally absent during\nthe rest of period.\nOur observations, which as stated above were obtained\nwhile SPEAR operated with an ERP of approximately\n15 MW, are consistent with a negligible SPEAR-induced\nchange in the plasma temperature. As suggested in R2006,\nthis relatively low SPEAR pump power may result in limited\nheating of the plasma when compared to the temperature en-\nhancements that are routinely seen using the Troms\u00f8 heater,\nwhich has an ERP of several hundred MW (Rietveld et al.,\n1993). This variability in the temperature enhancements pro-\nvides motivation for a study, involving variable heater pow-\ners, into the dependence of temperature increases and asso-\nciated RF-induced spectral enhancements on the transmit-\nted pump wave power. Similar motivation exists to study\nfurther the infrequent occurrence of the overshoot in our\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1801\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 1801\u20131814, 2007\n1812 R. S. Dhillon et al.: SPEAR-enhanced E- and F-region ESR spectra\nobservations, again using an experiment with variable heater\npowers to investigate how the presence and frequency of the\novershoot are affected by the heater power.\nTurning now to the CUTLASS coherent scatter data\nshown in Fig. 2, only data from interval 2 (3 Decem-\nber 2005) displayed detectable SPEAR-induced backscat-\nter enhancements observed by CUTLASS, and then only in\ndata recorded by the Finland radar. The SPEAR-enhanced\nbackscatter was present for the entire 2-min SPEAR-on in-\nterval in both channels. Combining these observations with\nthe well accepted result that irregularities are generated at\naltitudes below those at which the O-mode pump wave is re-\nflected, the ESR observations indicate that the artificial irreg-\nularities detected by CUTLASS were generated at the upper\nE-\/lower F-region. These altitudes are lower than those from\nwhere SPEAR-enhanced CUTLASS backscatter has been\nseen previously. These observations are unusual as modelled\npropagation paths obtained using ray tracing indicate that in-\nteraction altitudes in excess of 200 km are usually required\nin order for SPEAR-induced artificial backscatter to be seen\nin CUTLASS data (Yeoman, private communication, 2007).\nSince the irregularities are elongated and extend along the\nfield lines, it is instructive to see whether, although the irreg-\nularities may be generated in the upper E-\/lower F-region,\nthe backscatter from them may originate from higher alti-\ntudes. Senior et al. (2004), who followed on from studies\nundertaken previously (Jones et al. 1984; Robinson et al,\n1989), investigated the altitudinal extent of RF-induced ar-\ntificial field-aligned irregularities and determined that they\nhad e-folding scale lengths of approximately 20 km. Previ-\nous studies by Jones et al. (1984) and Robinson (1989) found\ne-folding scale lengths of 20 and 52 km, respectively. Al-\nthough the results of Robinson et al. (1989) do not neces-\nsarily support our findings, the figure of 20 km, obtained by\nboth Senior et al. (2004) and Jones et al. (1984), provides ev-\nidence that the upper E-\/lower F-region field-aligned density\nirregularities do not extend high enough to reach the region\nfrom where CUTLASS backscatter is usually observed. This\nsupports the hypothesis that the SPEAR-enhanced backscat-\nter does not originate from those F-region altitudes consistent\nwith ray-tracing studies and from where previous SPEAR-\nenhanced CUTLASS backscatter has been observed. This re-\nsult may indicate interesting propagation characteristics and\nresults from future campaigns will be examined in order to\nstudy this further. There were no SPEAR-induced CUT-\nLASS backscatter enhancements for the data from intervals\n1 (10 December 2004) and 3 (4 December 2005). This is\nconsistent with the ESR enhancements originating within the\nlower E-region, as CUTLASS backscatter is expected to be\nabsent from such low altitudes because of unfavourable prop-\nagation.\nThe theory of RF-induced enhancements in sporadic E-\nlayers has evolved over time. Both Gordon and Carlson\n(1976) and Djuth (1984) observed sporadic E-layer plasma\nline enhancements exactly at the radar frequency\u00b1 the pump\nfrequency. Djuth (1984) concluded that the modulational in-\nstability was probably below threshold during these obser-\nvations, and therefore direct conversion may play a role in\nexplaining the sporadic E-layer data. Djuth and Gonzales\n(1988) subsequently examined the temporal development of\nthe RF-enhanced sporadic E-layer plasma line in great de-\ntail and concluded that, although direct conversion of the\npump wave into Langmuir waves by in situ small-scale ir-\nregularities can explain rapid (less than 20\u00b5s) RF-enhanced\nplasma line growth, slower (greater than 100\u00b5s) observed\ngrowth times are difficult to explain with this process. In-\nstead, it was proposed that mode conversion along sporadic\nE-layer vertical gradients near the critical layer provides a\nbetter overall description of the observations, and that the\nformation of density cavities (cavitons) near the reflection\nheight may play an essential role in the production of Lang-\nmuir waves. These cavitons (e.g. Morales and Lee, 1977)\ncould give rise to the sporadic E-layer ion line enhancements\nreported in this paper. These cavitons and the spatial extent\nof associated density inhomogeneities are consistent with the\nstudy by Robinson (2002) who applied a multiple scatter the-\nory to the propagation of electromagnetic test waves during\nRF-induced heating and found a broadening of the interac-\ntion region.\nIt is noteworthy that the observed plasma line growth times\nin the range<4\u00b5s to 20\u00b5s are much shorter than those antic-\nipated for a convective parametric decay instability. Newman\net al. (1998) suggested that an absolute (i.e., non-convective)\nparametric decay instability could develop in the sporadic\nE-layer plasma. This was used to explain the large spo-\nradic E-layer airglow enhancements observed by Djuth et\nal. (1999) at altitudes of approximately 120 km. Bernhardt et\nal. (2003) indicated that linear mode conversion may also be\nimportant in explaining the sporadic E-layer airglow. Also,\nGondarenko et al. (2003) performed simulations that indi-\ncate that linear mode conversion in sporadic E-layer plasma\nabove Arecibo gives rise to localized regions containing am-\nplified electric fields. These enhanced electric fields could\naccelerate electrons and lead to the production of the intense\nairglow.\nRietveld et al. (2002) presented plasma line\/ion line ob-\nservations in an auroral E-layer having a scale height of 5-\n10 km. This is significantly different from sporadic E-layer\nplasma, where the scale height is 0.2\u20131 km or less (Djuth,\n1984). The underlying plasma physics are greatly affected\nby the vertical scale length. One expects the (propagational\nor convective) parametric decay instability and the oscillat-\ning two-stream instability (modulational instability) to be ex-\ncited in plasma with a scale height of 5\u201310 km, but not in\nsporadic E-layer plasma where the electron density gradients\nare much steeper. The reason for this is that in a steep spo-\nradic E-layer electron density gradient, the Langmuir wave\nvector quickly rotates away from the direction of the pump\nfield thereby decoupling from the pump. In addition, the\nwave rapidly propagates outside of the narrowly confined\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 1801\u20131814, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/1801\/2007\/\nR. S. Dhillon et al.: SPEAR-enhanced E- and F-region ESR spectra 1813\naltitude region of instability preventing significant Langmuir\nwave amplification from occurring (e.g. Perkins and Flick,\n1971; Fejer and Leer, 1972; Muldrew, 1978). Thus, the\nthresholds of the oscillating two stream instability and the\nstandard propagational\/convective parametric decay instabil-\nity become extremely large and therefore do not represent\nviable processes with which to explain the observations. In\nsummary, although the results of Rietveld et al. (2002) cer-\ntainly complement previous studies, they do not apply to the\nproduction of Langmuir waves in sporadic E-layers.\nModelling conducted by Goldman et al. (1995, 1997) was\nconsistent with the findings of Djuth (1984) and Djuth and\nGonzalez (1998) regarding the inhibition of the parametric\ndecay instability in sporadic E-layers. In agreement with the\nfindings of Djuth (1984), we have also observed steep verti-\ncal gradients in the plasma density of sporadic E-layers, to-\ngether with plasma density peaks at multiple altitudes. How-\never, our results from the lower F-\/upper E-region may be\nexplained by invoking both the purely growing mode and the\nparametric decay instability. This is consistent with the study\nby Djuth (1984), who found that, unlike in sporadic E-layers,\nF-region conditions supported excitation of the parametric\ndecay instability. Our data therefore provide supporting ev-\nidence for previous results obtained by Djuth (1984), Djuth\nand Gonzalez (1988) and Rietveld et al. (2002), and are not\ninconsistent with previous modelling and observations.\n5 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have presented SPEAR-induced spectral\nenhancements in ESR incoherent scatter data from the E-\nand F-regions of the polar ionosphere. We have seen spo-\nradic E-layer enhancements consistent with the formation of\ncavitons (e.g. Morales and Lee, 1977) and upper E- and F-\nregion enhancements consistent with the actions of both the\npurely growing mode and the parametric decay instability.\nThe conditions for excitation of these instabilities in vari-\nous ionospheric layers, together with other mechanisms for\nRF-enhanced ion and plasma lines, have been given previ-\nously (Djuth, 1984; Djuth and Gonzales, 1988; Rietveld et\nal., 2002) and our observations agree with earlier findings.\nFormer observations of RF-enhanced spectra in sporadic\nE-layers have been made at low, mid and high latitudes, us-\ning high-power facilities such as those located at Arecibo\nand Troms\u00f8. Our observations of SPEAR-enhanced spectra\nin sporadic E-layers were made in the polar ionosphere and\nconstitute the first such results that have been obtained. In\naddition to the importance of these results in their own right,\nour measurements satisfactorily complement low-, mid- and\nhigh-latitude studies that have been performed previously.\nAcknowledgements.
