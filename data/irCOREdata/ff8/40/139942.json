INTRODUCTION\nSpeckle shearing interferometry, often termed shearography1,2, is a full-field non-contact optical technique, usually used\nfor the qualitative measurement of changes in the displacement gradient caused by surface and subsurface defects. A\nspeckle pattern is formed by illuminating an optically rough surface with an expanded laser beam. In shearography this\nspeckle pattern is optically mixed with an identical but displaced, or sheared, speckle pattern using a shearing device,\nand viewed through a lens, forming a speckle interferogram at the camera surface. The shearing device commonly used\nfor shearography is a Michelson interferometer with a tilt applied to one of the mirrors1. Correlating speckle\ninterferograms obtained before and after object deformation yields correlation fringes sensitive to displacement gradient\nin the shear direction. Phase-stepping techniques3 are often used to extract the phase information, and therefore the\ndisplacement gradient information, from the speckle interferograms.\nShearography is able to measure six orthogonal components of displacement gradient allowing full characterisation of\nthe surface strain components. To determine these six components, measurements are performed with three different\ndirections of the sensitivity vector, which is the bisector of the illumination and viewing directions, and with two\northogonal directions of applied shear. The magnitude of the applied shear controls the sensitivity of the displacement\ngradient measurement. The measured components of displacement gradient are non-orthogonal and the orthogonal\ndisplacement gradient components are determined by a coordinate transformation.\nAn object that is curved, or has angled surfaces relative to the camera image plane, has a different magnitude of applied\nshear to that measured in the image plane. This variation in the applied shear relative to the measured magnitude of\napplied shear may be corrected for by considering the surface slope of the object in the shear direction. A knowledge of\nthe object shape allows the sensitivity vector to be locally determined across the object surface when performing the\ncoordinate transformation. It is desirable to calculate the displacement gradient components, relative to the object\nsurface profile, and this may also be performed using a knowledge of the object shape.\n                                                       \n*\n s.w.james@cranfield.ac.uk; phone 01234 754623; fax 01234 752452; http:\/\/www.cranfield.ac.uk\/sme\/cpoe; Optical Sensors\nGroup, Centre for Photonics and Optical Engineering, School of Engineering, Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedford, MK43 0AL,\nUK.\nOptical Diagnostics for Fluids, Solids, and Combustion, Carolyn R.

Correlating speckle interferograms recorded before\nand after a change in the illumination conditions4,5,6 generates correlation fringes sensitive to surface slope in the shear\ndirection. The shape of the object is determined by integrating the surface slope.\nIn this paper a welded joint in a gas main pipe is investigated. Six components of displacement gradient are measured\nusing three illumination directions, multiplexed in the time domain, a single camera and shearing head, and two\northogonal directions of applied shear. The surface slope is measured using a source displacement shearography\ntechnique5. The surface slope is integrated to obtain the shape of the object. A correction to the variation in applied\nshear across the object surface is made using surface slope information. The object shape is used to calculate local\nsensitivity vectors across the object surface, for each measurement channel. A coordinate transformation, using object\nshape information, is performed on the measured displacement gradient components to obtain the in-plane and out-of-\nplane displacement gradients across the surface of the object.\n2. THEORY\n2.1 Multi-component strain measurement using shearography\nShearography is a full field optical technique that can be used for the measurement of displacement gradient. A speckle\npattern is formed by illuminating an object, which has an optically rough surface, by an expanded laser beam. The\nspeckle pattern is optically mixed with an identical but displaced, or sheared, speckle pattern in a shearing\ninterferometer and viewed through a lens forming an interferometric speckle pattern which can be recorded by the\ncamera. Correlating speckle patterns obtained before and after object deformation yields correlation fringes sensitive to\ndisplacement gradient. Phase-stepping techniques3 can be used to extract the phase information, and therefore the\ndisplacement gradient, from the speckle interferograms.\nThe component of displacement gradient measured by shearography is determined by the sensitivity vector, which is the\nbisector of the illumination direction and the viewing direction, and by the direction of the applied shear. The out-of-\nplane components of displacement gradient can be measured directly by utilising illumination and viewing normal to\nthe object surface. To measure the in-plane components of displacement gradient requires the measurement of\ndisplacement gradient from two directions of sensitivity vector such that each of the measured components of\ndisplacement gradient contains a contribution from the out-of-plane and the in-plane components. The in-plane and out-\nof-plane components may then be calculated. If the illumination and viewing geometry is chosen to give opposing\ndirections of sensitivity vector a subtraction can be used to remove the out-of-plane displacement gradient component.\nThe second orthogonal in-plane displacement gradient component is determined by changing the illumination and\nviewing geometry.\nA measurement of all the three displacement gradient components, the out-of-plane and two in-plane components, can\nbe performed using either a single illumination direction and three viewing directions or a single viewing direction and\nthree illumination directions. The latter is employed in this paper. A coordinate transformation is used to transform from\nthe measured displacement gradient components to the out-of-plane and two in-plane components.\nThe optimum illumination geometry consists of three optical sources at three of the four corners of a square and with a\nminimum angle from the normal to the object surface of 11\u00b0 7. This is shown in Figure 1. The optimal positioning of the\noptical sources relative to the camera and the object is important to minimise errors introduced in performing the\ncoordinate transformation.\nThe applied shear is determined by the direction and magnitude of the tilt applied to the shearing mirror in the shearing\ninterferometer. Two orthogonal directions of applied shear, in conjunction with the three different illumination\ndirections, are required to obtain the six components of displacement gradient required to fully characterise the surface\nstrain. The magnitude of applied shear controls the measurement sensitivity and is typically of the order of 5 to 10 mm.\nProc.

The coordinate\nsystem used in this paper is shown, x and y are in the plane of the paper and z is normal to the plane of the paper.\nThe surface strain is determined from the six components of displacement gradient. Shearography is able to measure all\nthe surface strain components but is not able to measure the bulk strain components, \u03b4u\/\u03b4z, \u03b4v\/\u03b4z and \u03b4w\/\u03b4z. The strain\ntensor, S, is given by:\n2.2 Slope and shape measurement using shearography\nShearography can be used to perform surface slope measurement via a source displacement technique5, from which the\nobject shape can be determined. The technique is similar to that for measurement of displacement gradient. A reference\ninterferometric speckle pattern is recorded. The optical source is displaced and a second interferogram is recorded.\nCorrelating these two recorded interferograms yields correlation fringes sensitive to the surface slope of the object in\nthe shear direction. Phase-stepping techniques3 can be used to extract the phase information from the correlation\nfringes. To fully characterise the surface slope measurements are made using two orthogonal directions of applied\nshear, to yield surface slope measurements in two orthogonal directions.\nThe nature of the fringes obtained using the source displacement technique in shearography is dependent on the\ndirection of the source displacement and carrier fringes, slope sensitive fringes of a mixture of carrier and slope\nsensitive fringes can be generated. Carrier fringes are formed by a displacement to the optical along the source to object\noptical axis8. A source displacement in an orthogonal direction generates predominantly slope fringes5.\nInterferometer\nHead\nSource\nPosition 3\nSource\nPosition 2\nSource\nPosition 1\nx\ny\nz\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u0007\n\u0007\n\b\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\u000b\n\f\n\u0007\n\u0007\n\b\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\u000b\n\f\n\u0007\n\u0007\n\b\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\u000b\n\f\n\u0007\n\u0007\n\b\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\u000b\n\f\n\u0007\n\u0007\n\b\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\u000b\n\f\n\u0007\n\u0007\n\b\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\u000b\n\f\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\nz\nw\nz\nv\ny\nw\nz\nu\nx\nw\ny\nw\nz\nv\ny\nv\ny\nu\nx\nv\nx\nw\nz\nu\nx\nv\ny\nu\nx\nu\nS\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n(1)\nProc.

The relationship between the different system parameters and the sensitivity of the fringes to the\nsurface slope of the object were investigated numerically and linear and non-linear relationships were identified. The\nsource and illumination geometry, the direction of source displacement and the position in the camera field of view\nhave complex non-linear relationships to the sensitivity of the fringes to object slope. For most practical experimental\nconditions the optical wavelength, the magnitude of source direction and the magnitude of applied shear have a linear\nrelationship to the sensitivity of the slope sensitive fringes. The sensitivity vector must be inclined, with respect to the\nnormal to the object surface, in the direction of the source displacement to give fringes sensitive to surface slope. The\nphase change \u03c6S(x,y) at a point (x,y) on the object surface is given by:\n \n( ) ( ) ( )\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n+= yxCyx\ndx\ndzKDVdxyxS ,,, \u03bb\u03c6 (2)\nwhere DV is the magnitude of a source displacement, predominantly in the y direction, dx is the applied shear, \u03bb is the\noptical wavelength, K is the slope sensitivity constant, dz\/dx(x,y) is the surface slope at point (x,y) and C(x,y) is the\nzero slope constant. The slope sensitivity constant is calculated numerically using a model of the correlation fringe\nformation.\nThe zero slope constant is determined experimentally using a flat plate test object. The flat plate object replaces the\nobject under investigation, with the orientation of the flat plate defining the plane of zero slope. The slope fringe\nformation procedure is repeated for the flat plate, using an identical direction and magnitude of source displacement,\nand after image processing values of C(x,y) are determined across the field of view. These values of C(x,y) can be\nsubtracted from the slope, determined from the object under investigation, to remove any influence on these slope\nfringes from the change in sensitivity vector across the field of view. The scaling of the slope obtained is determined by\nusing Equation 2.\n2.3 Strain measurement utilising slope and shape information\nThe slope and shape information can be used to correct the displacement gradient measurements for slope and shape\ndependent measurement errors and can also provide a surface onto which the strain measurements can be mapped.\nCorrections are made for the applied shear, and therefore the displacement gradient sensitivity, varying across a curved\nsurface and for the change in sensitivity vector across the object surface.\nThe applied shear is usually measured in the plane of the camera image. For a curved surface, or surface inclined with\nrespect to the plane of the camera image, the applied shear on the object surface is larger, as the measured applied shear\nis stretched over a larger distance on the object surface. This error can be corrected using a knowledge of the object\nslope and simple geometry. The corrected shear, dxC, is calculated using:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n+\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n=\n2\n2\n1\ndx\ndzdxdx MC (3)\nwhere dxM is the measured applied shear and dz\/dx is the surface slope in the x direction.\nThe error due to the variation in the sensitivity vector across the object surface can be corrected by calculating\nindividual sensitivity vectors for points across the object surface using a knowledge of system geometry. A knowledge\nof the field of view and the shape of the object permits the location of the object surface in three-dimensional space,\nrelative to a reference point on the object surface. The illumination positions and the viewing position relative to this\nreference point are measured. From this information the local sensitivity vector, for each of the three illumination\ndirections, can be determined across the object surface.\nA knowledge of the shape of the object also allows the surface strain components to be mapped onto the object surface.\nThe local directions of the two in-plane and one out-of-plane vectors are determined using the information of the object\nshape and the measured displacement gradient components are transformed into this coordinate system at that point on\nProc.

The calculation of the directions of the in-plane and out-of-plane components and the coordinate\ntransformation are repeated across the object surface.\n3. EXPERIMENTAL\nThe Cranfield multi-component shearography system7 was modified to incorporate a method of performing source\ndisplacement allowing both the displacement gradient measurements and the surface slope and shape measurements to\nbe performed using the same system.\nThe multi-component shearography system utilised three illumination directions and one interferometer head to perform\nthe measurements. Three fibre Bragg grating stabilised laser diodes (810 nm, 100 mW optical power), with fibre optic\nbeam delivery to the source position were used to illuminate the object. The Bragg gratings stabilised the output\nwavelength of the laser diodes when the laser injection current was modulated and the fibre optic beam delivery\nprovided spatial filtering and a flexible beam delivery to the source position for the surface slope measurement channel.\nLenses at the distal end of the fibres allowed an adjustment to the expansion of the beams illuminating the object. The\nsource positions were nominally located at 1. (0.2 m, -0.2 m, 0.3 m), 2. (0.2 m, 0.2 m, 0.3 m) and 3. (-0.2 m, 0.2 m, 0.3\nm), measured from the centre of the field of view in the object plane, at three of the four corners of a square as shown\npreviously in Figure 1. The optimum illumination geometry was determined previously7. Source position 3 was fitted\nwith a translation stage at the end of the fibre allowing source displacement in three orthogonal directions. This channel\nwas used to perform the surface slope and shape measurements.\nThe interferometer head was composed of a Michelson interferometer, camera lens and camera. The Michelson\ninterferometer consisted of a beamsplitter, a shearing mirror that could be adjusted to give different magnitudes and\ndirections of applied shear and a reference mirror, which was fitted with a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) allowing\nphase-stepping to be performed. The camera, an area scan CCD camera (Dalsa CA-D4-0512A, 75 Hz frame rate, 512\nby 512 pixels), in conjunction with a PCI bus frame transfer card (Roadrunner) was used to record the speckle\ninterferograms. A PC controlled the modulation of the laser diode injection currents, the phase-stepping and the image\ncapture using a program written in LABVIEWTM.\n3.1 Multi-component displacement gradient measurement\nTo fully characterise the surface strain required the measurement of six components of displacement gradient. The six\ncomponents were measured using three illumination directions and two orthogonal directions of applied shear. Figure 2\nshows the experimental layout.\nInitially the shear was applied in the x direction. The object was sequentially illuminated from the three illumination\ndirections by modulating the Bragg grating stabilised laser diode injection currents between below threshold and the\noperating current, in synchronisation with the recording of reference camera frames. After deformation of the object the\nlaser diode pulsing sequence was repeated, but with three phase-stepped signal frames recorded from each channel. The\ncamera frames from an individual channel were processed using a phase-stepping algorithm to yield an unwrapped\nphase map and unwrapped using commercial software. This process was repeated for the three channels to yield three\nmeasured displacement gradient components. The shear was then applied in the y direction and the recording of\nreference and phase-stepped signal frames before and after object deformation, respectively, was repeated to yield the\nother three displacement gradient components.\nProc.

Illumination of the object was\nfrom source position 3. A reference frame was recorded first. The source was then displaced in the v direction by a\nmagnitude of DV of the order of hundreds of microns and three phase-stepped signal frames were recorded. The v\ndirection is orthogonal to the source to object optical axis and is predominantly in the y (vertical) direction. The\nreference and signal frames were combined using a phase-stepping algorithm to yield an unwrapped phase map. This\nwas unwrapped using commercially available software. The object was replaced by a flat plate, with the normal to the\nsurface in the direction of the interferometer head. The process of capturing a reference frame, displacing the source in\nthe DV direction, recording three phase-stepped frames and the image processing was repeated. The magnitude and\ndirection of the source displacement must be the same as used for the object under investigation. The phase change\ndetermined for the flat plate was subtracted from the measured phase change on the object under investigation, and\nscaled using the parameters given in Equation 2, to yield the object slope. The object slope was integrated to obtain the\nobject shape.\n3.3 Surface strain measurement applying a correction for object slope and shape\nThe displacement gradient components were corrected for the change in applied shear and the variation in the\nsensitivity vector across the object and are mapped onto the object surface, as detailed in Section 2.3.

RESULTS\nThe test object was a section of stainless steel gas main pipe of length 900 mm and diameter 90 mm. This is shown in\nFigure 4. The pipe was constructed from two end plates and three pipe sections, joined by welds around the\ncircumference of the pipe. The section of the pipe investigated using shearography contained a welded joint between a\n15 mm and an 8 mm pipe section. The section of the pipe under investigation was coated with white paint.\nFigure 4 Photograph of (a) the gas main pipe and (b) a close-up of the section of pipe investigated using the Shearography system.\nThe black border in both pictures indicates the field of view of the camera of approximately 90 mm  by 90 mm\nDV\nS2\nobject\nBS\nlens\nMS\nIllumination\nDirections\nCCD\nMR\nPZT controlled\nPersonal\nComputer\nS1 x\ny\nz\nProc.

The\nillumination positions were situated at 1. (0.220 m, -0.173 m, 0.270 m), 2. (0.224 m, 0.176 m, 0.265 m) and 3. (-0.177\nm, 0.187 m, 0.210 m). Shears of magnitude 10 mm were applied in the x and the y directions. This yielded six\ncomponents of measured displacement gradient in total. The pipe was pressurised to 350 kPa before recording the\nreference frames and depressurised to 0 kPa before recording the phase-stepped signal frames. Figure 5 shows wrapped\nphase maps for the six measured displacement gradient components of a region of approximately 40 mm by 55 mm.\nThe intensity of scattered light from other regions of the surface within the field of view was insufficient to generate a\nwrapped phase map, when illuminated from one or more of the illumination directions.\nAfter the unwrapping procedure six unwrapped phase maps of the measured displacement gradient components are\nobtained, these are shown in Figure 6.\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f)\nFigure 5 (a), (b) and (c) are respectively the wrapped phase maps of displacement gradient for applied shear in the x direction for\nillumination directions 1, 2 and 3.

The white regions represent regions of maximum displacement\ngradient. In all pictures the weld is horizontally across the centre of the picture, where it is indicated by local changes in surface\ndisplacement gradient.\n4.2 Slope and shape measurement\nThe object surface slope and shape were measured using the source displacement technique described in Section 3.2.\nFor these measurements, channel 3 of the multi-component shearography system was used, with the source position\ninitially at (-0.177 m, 0.187 m, 0.210 m). The slope was measured using an applied shear of 10 mm in the x direction\nand a source displacement of 300 \u00b5m in the DV direction. A measurement of the phase change across a flat plate test\nobject was also performed for a source displacement of 300 \u00b5m in the DV direction. This phase change was subtracted\nfrom the phase change on the pipe to obtain the surface slope, in the shear direction, for the pipe. A value for the\nProc.

Figure 9 shows the six components of displacement gradient relative to the local object\nsurface. The range of the data is \u201332 \u00b5\u03b5 (black) to +32 \u00b5\u03b5 (white).

DISCUSSION\nA theoretical calculation of the hoop strain and longitudinal strain for a pressurised pipe were made and the values\nobtained were comparable with the in-plane displacement gradient components measured using the shearography\nsystem.\nIn this paper errors in the measurement of displacement gradient, due to the surface slope and shape are investigated\nand corrected. For a curved object, or for an object tilted relative to the plane of the camera image, the applied shear\nmeasured in the plane of the camera image is smaller than the actual applied shear at the object surface. For the slopes\nthat can practically be measured by this shearography system, between \u20131 and +1, the actual applied shear is larger than\nthe measured applied shear by a maximum of approximately 40%. There is also an error due to the direction of the\nsensitivity vector varying across the object surface. A knowledge of the object shape is used to correct for this variation\nin the sensitivity vector across the object surface.\nA source displacement generates a phase change across a flat plate surface, where the surface slope is zero. The surface\nslope measurements are corrected for this phase change. When the surface slope and shape determination are performed\nthe geometry of the illumination and imaging positions determines the sensitivity of the correlation fringes to surface\n\u00b5\u03b5\nProc.

In this paper a slope sensitivity constant, K, was used to perform the scaling of the measured\nslope. This constant was calculated numerically using a model of the fringe formation.\nFor both the displacement gradient and the slope measurements the slope of the surface relative to the illumination and\nimaging directions limits the regions on the pipe where satisfactory reading may be taken. This is because sufficient\noptical power is required at the camera to generate a satisfactory wrapped phase map. It may be possible to change the\nsurface coating or increase the laser power to perform measurements over a larger region of the surface of the pipe.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nShearography has successfully been used to measure the six displacement gradient components, the object slope in two\ndirections and the object shape in the region of a welded joint in a gas main pipe. The slope and shape information has\nbeen used to correct the displacement gradient measurements, with a correction made of up 40 % to the displacement\ngradient. This was achieved using the existing Cranfield multi-component shearography system, with the addition of a\ntranslation stage which was fitted to one of the existing source positions to provide the surface slope and shape\nmeasurement capability. The displacement gradient was mapped onto the object surface to obtain in-plane and out-of-\nplane displacement gradient components relative to the local profile of the object surface.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was partially supported by the European Union under Brite Euram project No. BE96 3116, MuWaS,\nMultiple Wavelength Shearography and by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK.\nREFERENCES\n1.
