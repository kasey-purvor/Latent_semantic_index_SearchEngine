Introduction\n[2] The midlatitude trough is an area of depleted\nelectron density in the nighttime F region ionosphere\nin which the critical frequencies drop by a factor of at\nleast two and the altitude of the electron density peak\nrises by 100 km or more [Moffett and Quegan, 1983].\nDuring the winter and equinoctial months, the trough\ntakes the form of a band a few degrees wide in latitude to\nthe equatorward side of the auroral oval, stretching in\nlocal time from dusk to dawn. In summer, the trough is\nmuch less pronounced and is confined to the hours\naround midnight. The location of the trough also depends\non geomagnetic activity; the trough region moving\nequatorward and the evening sector tending to move to\nearlier local times as activity increases.\n[3] The presence of the trough has a significant impact\non a number of radio systems. For transionospheric\nsignals, the reduction in total electron content over the\ntrough region affects the time of flight of the signals\nwhich, for example, may lead to incorrect ionospheric\ncorrections and hence timing and positional errors in\nsatellite based navigation systems such as GPS and the\nforthcoming European Galileo system. For HF systems,\nthe principle concern of this paper, the electron density\ndepletion in the trough region reduces the maximum\nfrequency that can be reflected by the ionosphere along\nthe great circle path (GCP). Gradients in electron density\nassociated with the trough walls and embedded iono-\nspheric irregularities often result in propagation in which\nthe signal path is well displaced from the great circle\ndirection, with directions of arrival at the receiver offset\nby up to 100\u0001 [Rogers et al., 1997]. For long paths, the\nelectron density depletion suppresses propagation along\nthe great circle, and the signal is often received via a\nground\/sea-scatter mechanism to the side of the great\ncircle direction [Stocker et al., 2003]. Deviations from\nthe great circle direction impact not only on radiolocation\nsystems for which estimates of a transmitter location are\nobtained by triangulation from a number of receiving\nsites, but also on any radio communications system in\nwhich directional antennas are employed. Furthermore,\nthe Doppler and multimode delay spread characteristics\nof the signal are also affected when propagation is via\nscatter\/reflection from irregularities in or close to the\nnorth wall of the trough [Warrington et al., 1997;\nWarrington and Stocker, 2003]. Rapid deterioration in\nachievable data throughput in digital communications\nlinks occurs when the delay and Doppler spreads exceed\nsystem-dependent values [Angling et al., 1998], and\nhence it is desirable that full account be taken of these\nRADIO SCIENCE, VOL. 39, RS4008, doi:10.1029\/2004RS003049, 2004\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0048-6604\/04\/2004RS003049$11.00\nRS4008 1 of 10\npropagation mechanisms in planning and operating HF\ncommunication systems.\n[4] The trough has been modeled on a statistical basis\nby various researchers [see, e.g., Halcrow and Nisbet,\n1977; Hanbaba, 1999; Rothkaehl et al., 2000; Feichter\nand Leitinger, 2001]. Recent developments in iono-\nspheric tomography [Kersley et al., 1997; Mitchell et\nal., 1997] and observations made with EISCAT [Jones et\nal., 1997] have provided further experimental observa-\ntions of the trough position and structure. In this paper,\nmeasurements are presented of the direction of arrival\n(DOA) and the time of flight (TOF) of HF signals\nreceived over a 1400 km path oriented along the\ntrough between Uppsala, Sweden and the University of\nLeicester\u2019s field site near to Leicester (see Figure 1). The\nexperiment was operational between October 2000 and\nJanuary 2002.\n2. Observations\n[5] Six frequencies were used during the experiment,\nnamely 4.6, 7.0, 10.4, 11.1, 14.4, and 18.4 MHz. Trans-\nmissions on each frequency were made over a period of\nthirty seconds with an overall cycle time of 3 min. Each\ntransmission period contained two 13-bit Barker-coded\nBPSK transmissions each of 2 s duration with a chip rate\nof 1667 baud. Both the transmitter and the receiver\nsystem clocks were synchronized to GPS so that the\ndirection of arrival and signal strength could be measured\nas a function of absolute time of flight. The direction of\narrival of the various signal components was estimated\nusing the Capon superresolution algorithm [Capon,\n1969; Featherstone et al., 1997]. As an additional\ndiagnostic, a BR Communications chirpsounder system\nwas deployed with the transmitter collocated with the\nmain transmitter in Uppsala and the receiver at the\nUniversity of Leicester.\n2.1. Example Measurements\n[6] Measurements at 10.4 MHz are presented in\nFigure 2. These are typical of those found throughout\nthe entire data set for the 7.0 to 11.1 MHz signals. The\nlarge deviations occur less frequently at the other fre-\nquencies. During the day, the signal strength versus time\nof flight plot (top left panel) indicates the presence of\n3 modes, identified as 1F, 2F and 3F. The azimuthal\nangle of arrival (second left panel) is close to the GCP\n(46\u0001) for each mode while the elevation angle (third left\npanel) is around 10\u0001, 20\u0001 and 40\u0001 respectively. The\nfrequency spectrum (bottom left panel) shows a narrow\npeak. The method employed by Angling et al. [1998] is\nadopted here to quantify Doppler spread in which\nFigure 1.

In these\nterms, the spread in the daytime example of Figure 2 is\n1.3 Hz. At night (right hand panels in Figure 2) two\nmodes are evident: a narrow one at a TOF of just less\nthan 7 ms (i.e., at about the same delay as the 3F daytime\nmode) and a second, slightly broader, mode with a longer\nTOF. The azimuthal direction of both modes is about 25\u0001\nto the north of the GCP (note there appears to be a small\nvariation in the bearing within each mode, e.g., the tail\nedge of the first mode is only about 5\u0001 north of the GCP)\nand elevation angles in the range 10\u0001\u201317\u0001. A somewhat\nbroader frequency spectrum is observed than that for the\ndaytime case, with a composite Doppler spread of 5 Hz.\n[7] Figure 3 shows oblique ionograms taken along the\nUppsala-Leicester path for nighttime and daytime on the\nsame day. The ionogram on the left was recorded at\n1134 UT, and shows the three F region modes seen in\nFigure 2 with an MUF around 28 MHz and an E mode\nbelow the 1F trace. The ionogram on the right was taken\nat 0206 UT and displays the expected nighttime 1F trace\nwhich has a maximum frequency of about 4 MHz and a\n\u2018spread\u2019 echo extending up to about 14 MHz. Note that\nthe ionograms recorded around midnight exhibit similar\nfeatures however the contrast is low making them less\nsuitable for reproduction here. For a discussion of iono-\ngram features observed over paths along the trough, see\nRogers et al. [2003].\n[8] The TOF, bearing, elevation, Doppler shift and\nspread and carrier to noise ratio measurements made\nover three days in November 2001 at 10.4 MHz are\nshown in Figure 4. As for the data presented in Figure 2,\nthe daytime signals frequently exhibit 1-hop, 2-hop and\n3-hop F region propagation along the GCP (see TOF\nplots). The Doppler spread is low and the signal is\nrelatively strong, reduced only by D region absorption\nin the middle of the day. At night, a wider variety of\neffects are observed. On the first night (day 324\u2013325),\nthe daytime trace deviates northward at sunset and is\nthen replaced by intermittent E region propagation on the\nGCP. The signal strength is about 20 dB lower than the\ndaytime value and Doppler spread is low. On the second\nnight (day 325\u2013326), just after midnight, propagation\noccurs via a mode with a relatively long TOF (8\u201310 ms)\nand direction of arrival 40\u0001\u201360\u0001 to the north of the GCP.\nThe signal is around 20 dB weaker than the daytime\nvalues with a Doppler shift of up to about 5 Hz. The\nmost striking behavior can be observed on the third night\n(day 326\u2013327) where a propagation mode appears at a\nlong TOF (up to 13 ms) at about 2030 UT. Over the next\nFigure 2. Example measurements made at 10.4 MHz of signals received near Leicester on 23 November 2001 (day\n327) for daytime (1134 UT, left) and nighttime (0004 UT, right). From the top, the panels represent signal strength\n(linear, normalized) versus time-of-flight (ms), azimuth (degrees) versus time-of-flight (ms), elevation (degrees)\nversus time-of-flight (ms), and amplitude (dB) versus Doppler frequency (Hz). The three daytime and two nighttime\nmodes in the upper panels sometimes appear to be subdivided by direction of arrival. Care must be taken in\ninterpreting these measurements when the signal amplitude is low (e.g., toward the leading and trailing edges of the\nreceived pulses).\nFigure 3.

At times around midnight a\nweaker, second mode at a longer delay (\u000111 ms) is\npresent (cf. Figure 2). As the TOF decreases, the bearing\ndeviation from great circle decreases from about 40\u0001\nnorth at 2030 UT to 20\u0001 north at 0230 UT, the elevation\nangle increases from around 10\u0001 to 15\u201320\u0001 and the signal\nstrength attains a level only about 10 dB below the\ndaytime, on-GCP level. The rapid decrease in TOF is\naccompanied by a strong positive Doppler shift (\u000120 Hz).\nThe Doppler spread is higher than daytime values until\nthe direction of arrival deviates northward (around\n0300 UT) when it is about the same as during the day.\n2.2. Occurrence Statistics\n[9] Table 1 shows the percentage of nights on which\nvarious features are seen for the four central frequencies\nin the experiment. The seasons are defined according to\nITU recommendation P1148 [International Telecommu-\nnication Union (ITU ), 1997], with spring including all of\nMarch and April, summer including May to August,\nautumn September and October and winter November to\nFebruary. In deriving these statistics, propagation is\ndeemed to have occurred if any readily identifiable\ntrace, other than sporadic E, is seen between 2100 and\n0300 UT. However, during some intervals, the data\nquality was not sufficient to categorize the direction of\narrival and these together with the short-lived deviations\nthat sometimes occur briefly at dawn and dusk (see, e.g.,\nsunrise on day 326 in Figure 4) have been excluded. The\nnighttime feature observed on day 326\u2013327 (a long TOF\naccompanied by northerly bearing deviations of up to\n50\u0001 and Doppler shifts) is a relatively common occur-\nrence in the nonsummer months. During the summer, the\ndeviation in azimuth tended to be much smaller (<5\u0001) but\nstill generally to the north. Deviations to the south are\nvery rare, small in angle and short-lived. Table 1 also\nshows the percentage of nights when no propagation is\nFigure 4. Measurements made at 10.4 MHz between noon on 20 November 2001 (day 324) and noon on\n23 November 2001 (day 327).

VOACAP computes monthly\nmedians of propagation likelihood for a given hour of the\nday, and the hour in the period 2100\u20130300 UT with the\nhighest probability of propagation is taken to be repre-\nsentative of the probability of propagation for that night.\nThe probability is averaged over the relevant months to\ngive the value presented in Table 1. Sporadic E propa-\ngation is excluded, as the model used in VOACAP to\npredict this can give misleading results [Lane, 2001].\nWhile VOACAP does not explicitly include a model of\nthe trough, its effect may be present to some extent in the\nunderlying CCIR maps of the various ionospheric prop-\nagation parameters, e.g., M(3000). For all frequencies,\nVOACAP underestimates how often propagation occurs.\nThe frequencies shown in Table 1 define the limits of the\noff-GCP propagation for this path. For the remaining\nfrequencies: at 4.6 MHz, GCP propagation is seen almost\nevery night, and no clear long TOF events can be\ndistinguished, whereas at 18.4 MHz, propagation is only\nseen at night two or three times in the whole study.\n[10] The azimuthal deviations may be compared to\nthose seen by Rogers, Warrington et al. [1997] over\npaths which traversed the midlatitude trough. Using\nfrequencies 5.1, 10.9 and 15.9 MHz, they observed\ndeviations to the north and south of approximately\nequal size and frequency. The deviations had similar\nseasonal and diurnal variations as seen here, and were\naccompanied by Doppler spread. The differences\nbetween these two experiments are explored in further\ndetail in the article which accompanies this [Siddle et\nal., 2004].\n[11] The solid curve of Figure 5 indicates the time\nafter sunset at which the 1F main daytime mode of\nGCP propagation ceases, while the dashed line indi-\ncates the time after sunrise at which GCP recom-\nmences. Sunset and sunrise were calculated at a\npoint 300 km above Earth\u2019s surface at the mid point\nof the GCP. Variation of this position laterally by \u00b13\u0001\nor vertically by \u00b1200 km made only about 10%\ndifference to the standard deviation of the distributions,\nbut caused a shift in the distributions with respect to\ndusk or dawn by about an hour. Data from May to\nAugust of 2001, when the Sun does not set at this\naltitude and location, are excluded from this analysis.\nEven during the included times, GCP propagation is\nsometimes detected between the end of the main mode\nand its start on the following day, either via E or F\nregion propagation. Nevertheless, there is usually a\ncusp as the TOF increases sharply close to sunrise and\nsunset, and this is taken to be the beginning or end of\nthe main daytime mode. It can be seen that the start of\nthe main daytime mode is more highly correlated to\nsunrise than the end is to sunset. This is expected from\nthe different processes governing production and decay\nof ionization and the occurrence time of the trough\nwhich depends on the level of geomagnetic activity.\nFigure 5. Plot of the time after sunset at which the 1F\nmain daytime mode of GCP propagation ceases (solid)\nand of time after sunrise at which it starts again (dashed)\nfor 10.4 MHz. Sunset and sunrise were calculated at a\npoint 300 km above Earth\u2019s surface at the midpoint of the\nGCP on the basis of 200 data points for the cessation\nof on-GCP propagation and 193 data points for the start\nof on-GCP propagation. Days 1\u2013123 and 235\u2013365 of\n2001.\nFigure 6. Time of cessation of 10.4 MHz GCP\npropagation after dusk at GCP midpoint and 300 km\naltitude versus Kp for September and October of 2001.\n(Note that Kp readings of n\u0002 and n+ are evaluated as\nn \u0002 0.3 and n + 0.3, respectively).\nRS4008 SIDDLE ET AL.: HF SIGNALS ALONG THE TROUGH\u2014OBSERVATIONS\n7 of 10\nRS4008\nFigure 6 shows the delay between sunset and the end\nof GCP propagation at 10.4 MHz plotted against the\nKp observed at 2100 UT, for autumn nights. A\ncorrelation coefficient of around \u00020.60 was obtained\nshowing that low magnetic activity allows GCP prop-\nagation to continue later into the evening. A similar\nplot for spring gives a correlation of \u00020.56, but a\nmuch lower correlation of \u00020.25 is obtained for\nwinter. The difference between winter and equinox in\n2001 may in part be due to the quiet geomagnetic\nconditions observed in the winter months (Kp does not\nexceed 5). Together, Figures 5 and 6 show that the\nsolar zenith angle and level of geomagnetic activity\n(indicated by Kp) are controlling factors as to whether\nor not propagation along the great circle path is\nsupported, and corroborating evidence that the off-\nGCP propagation is due to the presence of the trough.\n[12] Figure 7 shows the spread seen in the Doppler\nmeasurements for the 7.0, 10.4 and 11.1 MHz signals\noccurring throughout the day. It includes all data whose\nazimuth of arrival lies between 0\u0001 (north) and 90\u0001 (east).\nAzimuth is divided into on-GCP, between 35\u0001 and 55\u0001,\nand off-GC outside this range. The relative scarcity and\nindefiniteness of southerly signals precludes separate\ntreatment of northerly and southerly signals here. All\nthe distributions shown in Figure 7 have a lower decile at\n0.6 Hz (equal to the resolution of the Doppler spread),\nbut the upper deciles exhibit differences. For GCP\nsignals, all frequencies give an upper decile of 1.9 Hz\nin the winter and 1.3 Hz in the summer. Off-GCP signals\nare more spread, with upper deciles of 8.2, 7.6 and 9.2 Hz\nfor 7.0, 10.4 and 11.1 MHz respectively in winter and\n14.1, 3.2 and 8.8 Hz for 7.0, 10.4 and 11.1 MHz\nrespectively in summer. For comparison, the particular\noff-GCP event on day 326\u2013327 in Figure 4 lies within\nthe 0\u0001\u201335\u0001azimuth band and has an upper decile of\n4.4 Hz. The fact that the (mostly northerly) off-GCP\nsignals have generally higher values of Doppler spread is\nFigure 7. Plots of Doppler spread for all data taken in 2001. From top to bottom: frequencies 7.0,\n10.4, and 11.1 MHz. Data are divided by azimuth of arrival: crosses for GCP, circles for off-GCP.\nThe area under each curve is the same, and relative contributions to the whole are indicated as\npercentages. Note that the resolution of the Doppler data is approximately 0.6 Hz, so a point at\n0.3 Hz represents all data in the first FFT bin (0\u20130.6 Hz) and at 0.9 Hz represents all data in the\nsecond FFT bin (0.6\u20131.2 Hz), etc.\nRS4008 SIDDLE ET AL.: HF SIGNALS ALONG THE TROUGH\u2014OBSERVATIONS\n8 of 10\nRS4008\nconsistent with scattering from irregularities in the north\nwall and\/or auroral oval.\n3. Conclusions\n[13] The establishment of a multifrequency HF circuit\nbetween Uppsala and Leicester has allowed us to observe\nsimultaneously the direction of arrival, time of flight,\nDoppler shift and Doppler spread of signals reflected\nfrom the ionosphere. During the day, the measurements\nusually show propagation via the F region along the\nGCP with little Doppler spread. At night, however, off-\ngreat circle propagation often occurs which may be via\nreflection from the north wall of the midlatitude trough\nor by scatter from irregularities embedded within the\nwall or slightly to the north when the oval and trough\nwall do not coincide. This type of off-GCP propagation\noccurs on nights when none is predicted by VOACAP\nand preferentially in winter and near equinox. The\nstrongest examples of off-GCP reflection are seen at\nfrequencies 7.0, 10.4 and 11.1 MHz. Southerly devia-\ntions are much less frequent and smaller in angle and\nduration.\n[14] Measurements indicate that signals arriving at\nnight from north of the GCP often have a greater Doppler\nspread than those arriving on-GCP. Spread traces are also\nseen on the oblique ionograms taken at time of northerly\nreflection, indicating that the propagation mechanism\ndiffers from that for GCP. The latter are consistent with\nreflection from electron density gradients, while the\nformer suggests scattering from irregularities.\n[15] That the off-GCP propagation is controlled by the\nmidlatitude trough is shown by its dependence on solar\nradiation at the point of reflection. This dependence is\nmore direct for sunrise, whereas the start of propagation\nat sunset depends also on Kp.\n[16] The mechanisms by which off-great circle path\npropagation occurs have been investigated through sim-\nulation, the results of which are reported by in the\ncompanion paper by Siddle et al. [2004].\n[17] Acknowledgments. The authors would like to thank\nthe Swedish Meteorological Institute for hosting the transmitter\nat their Marsta site.
