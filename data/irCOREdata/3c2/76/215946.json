The boom in house prices was followed by a bust, the massive \nexpansion in the availability of mortgages was reversed, and mortgage terms became more \nrestrictive. In this paper we examine some of the outcomes of the crisis.  We look at several \ncountries that experienced great volatility to see how their mortgage markets behaved and how \ntheir governments responded to the challenges presented by the financial and housing market \ncrises. \n \nThe paper first reviews general data on house prices and financial flows before examining the \nvariation in experience across countries in two areas: first, how mortgage systems responded to \nthe liquidity crisis and increasing risk in the market; and second, how governments addressed \nthe problems of individual borrowers.  Finally the paper draws together the different strands to \ngive an overview of responses to the credit crisis.  \n \nMuch of the information is drawn from a survey conducted by the Housing Finance Working \nGroup of the European Network for Housing Research.  We gratefully acknowledge the \nimportant contribution of the housing experts who responded1. The survey asked about the \namount and characteristics of new residential mortgage lending, the extent of negative equity, \nand government programmes to counteract the effects of the crisis on borrowers.  It was \ndistributed in January 2009, and replies were received in February and March 2009.   \n \nTrends in housing and mortgage markets \n \nHouse price movements \n \nAfter unprecedentedly strong and long-lived growth in real house prices in many countries, \nmarkets started to soften in 2006.  The peak in house prices came a little later but in most \ncountries preceded the broader-based credit crunch that followed the Lehman disaster in \nSeptember 2008.  Thereafter the near closure of many mortgage markets and major concerns \nabout recession changed the nature of markets completely, and in most developed countries \nthe pace of mortgage borrowing slowed dramatically. \n \nThe extraordinary duration and strength of the boom in most major economies had not gone \nunnoticed. At the end of 2005, the OECD commented that \u2018a number of elements in the current \nsituation are unprecedented: the size and duration of the current real house price increases \n(and) the degree to which they have tended to move together across countries\u2026\u2019 (Girouard et \nal., 2006, p.4).   When the OECD analysed real house price developments since 1970, it found \nan average duration for house price growth of 5\u00bd years, and 4\u00bd years for periods of decline \nand stagnation (Girouard et al., 2006). The latest period of growth started in the middle of the \n1990s and lasted until 2007 in most countries\u2014that is, more than twice the historical average. \n \nTable 1 gives data on the most recent period of house price rises in the 12 OECD countries \nexamined in this paper, all of which saw significant real growth over the decade2.  In eight of \nthese countries real house prices peaked in 2007. Nominal house prices peaked in the same \n 3 \nquarter as real prices for most countries, because inflation was low.  However a number of \nOECD countries were not part of this picture \u2013 including Germany, Austria, Switzerland and \nJapan\u2014and are excluded from this discussion.   \n \nTable 1 here \n \nThe strength of real house price growth varied between countries. Ireland\u2019s was particularly \nhigh, at 404% from 2Q1987 to 3Q2006.   But real house prices more than doubled in nine of the \nother countries including the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, the UK, Spain, Sweden, France, \nFinland and Australia. The initial stages of housing market decline were gradual as transactions, \noutput and prices started to slow.  The subprime crisis in the USA took hold in the spring 2007 \nand prices began to fall. From the middle of that year, liquidity in the capital markets tightened \nand the financial crisis spread across the globe, nourished in many countries by a huge \nexpansion in credit and high-risk developments in the financial system (Kim & Renaud 2009).  \nThis sudden decline in housing markets contributed to the financial crisis, which then fed back \ninto housing markets, as had happened in earlier recessions in the USA (Leamer 2007). The \nproblems tended to be most serious in countries where high percentages of households had \nmortgages; where the amount of mortgage credit had greatly expanded; and\/or where debt \nlevels were high (Green and Wachter 2008; OECD 2007; Scanlon et al., 2008).  Table 1 shows \nthe fall in house prices from their peak to late 2008, the relevant period with regard to the policy \nresponses described in this paper.  Only the Netherlands did not experience the decline. \n \nReal house price movements were tightly correlated across countries. Figure 1 shows price \ndevelopments in the USA, UK, France, Ireland, Australia and Denmark since 1970. The \ntrajectory of house price movements in the latter part of the period was aptly described as \nresembling \u2018a rocket taking off\u2019 by Shiller (2005, p. 12).  \n \nFigure 1 here \n \nThere were no \u2018soft landings\u2019 during this period:  real houses prices fell sharply after the peak, \nparticularly in Ireland, Denmark, New Zealand and the UK\u2014which were among the countries \nwith the highest house price inflation. Previous downturns have shown that house price falls \ntend not to be monotonic; they can be interrupted by periods of stagnation or even increasing \nhouse prices. Recent statistics suggest that the rate of house price decline slowed in many \ncountries in 2009, and prices in some countries started to rise again as central banks worldwide \ncut interest rates, increased public expenditure and\/or reduced taxes to counter the recession.  \n \nMortgage markets \n \nLike all markets, the mortgage market is the totality of interactions between suppliers (investors) \nand consumers (borrowers) with intermediaries (mortgage lenders and brokers) in between, in a \nframework set by law and regulation.  Changes affecting any of these categories affect the \ncharacteristics and effectiveness of the market. \n \nAfter a period during which mortgage funding and mortgage debt grew very rapidly\u2014faster than \nGDP in most countries (EMF, 2009) \u2014market conditions facing lenders started to change in \n2007 and worsened over the following year, culminating in the worldwide collapse of finance \nmarkets after Lehman.  Each bank feared that its competitors had taken on significant credit \nrisk; this led to a sharp contraction in interbank lending and eventually to a wave of failures of \nbanks and other financial institutions.  In the mortgage markets, potential lenders judged the risk \nof nonpayment to be increasing and started to charge higher interest rates to mortgagors\u2014or \n 4 \nsimply refused to lend at any rate. In particular, those lending institutions whose funds came \nfrom money markets rather than from depositors had to lend at higher rates because they, as \nborrowers, were paying higher spreads above the central banks\u2019 base rates or, in some cases, \nwere unable to borrow at all from their normal sources. As house prices fell, lenders saw the \nvalue of their collateral decline.  This price fall was expected to continue, so new loans were \nbeing made against collateral whose value was expected to decline in the short to medium term. \n \nIn most countries there had been continued deregulation of financial markets and consequent \nproduct innovation (Scanlon et al, 2008).  This provided borrowers with greater choice and \nallowed lenders more actively to manage their portfolios of assets (\u2018treasury management\u2019). The \nextent to which affected balance sheets even in countries that had not themselves followed the \nderivative model only became clear when the system went into collapse in late 2008.  \n \nThe general economic environment worsened very rapidly.  Most of Europe entered recession \nin late 2008.  The problems were not confined to countries that had been in the forefront of the \nboom but also affected those with relatively stable housing markets such as Germany.  This \nvery general decline meant that risks were far more highly correlated than had been expected \u2013 \nand this correlation appeared to be exacerbated by the 2004 adoption of the \u2018Basel II\u2019 accord by \nthe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  This stipulated that capital-adequacy rules had \nto reflect risk, so banks with riskier assets should hold more capital.  The capital-adequacy \nstandards, together with \u2018mark-to-market\u2019 rules under which assets had to be valued at market \nrather than historic values, meant that as house prices fell, banks and other financial institutions \nhad to provide significant additional capital.  This further reduced their capacity to lend (though it \nincreased their chances of survival). So lenders faced a challenging set of circumstances \nparticularly because \u2018unlike other loans, the cash flow to repay a property loan is not \nindependent of the collateral, with changes in vacancy rates or rental values being immediately \nreflected in the resale value of the building.  Also collateral for property loans is highly specific \nand potentially illiquid\u2019 (Davis 1995, Chapter 10). \n \nOn the demand side, existing borrowers faced an increased risk of negative equity.  Those most \nlikely to be affected were those who had withdrawn equity (often through re-mortgaging) or \nbought at or near the price peak and therefore had high loan-to-value ratios. Negative equity \nhad a spatial dimension: it was concentrated in areas where prices had increased sharply and \nthen fallen\u2014in the USA, for example, it was highest in Phoenix, Las Vegas etc. Negative equity \nis not necessarily a problem in and of itself \u2013 it depends on the wording of default legislation and \nwhether the household needs to move \u2013 but it does reduce mortgagors\u2019 options if they face \nother difficulties. And that happened more often as the worsening global recession brought \nabout job losses and pay cuts.  These affected borrowers\u2019 capacity to meet mortgage payments \nand put pressure on both the mortgage industry and housing markets.  \n \nAn important issue in some countries was that mortgages denominated in foreign currencies \nbecame unaffordable.  The problems in Iceland were particularly severe.  They stemmed from \nthe collapse of Icelandic-owned banks as a result of both mismanagement and their exposure to \nmainland Europe, which overwhelmed the small country\u2019s economy. The Icelandic krona \ndevalued from 54.5\/Swiss franc to over 103\/Swiss franc between December 2007 and October \n2008, doubling the value in krona of the 9% of outstanding mortgages denominated in foreign \ncurrencies (which were mostly in Swiss francs and yen).  The devaluation also increased the \nprice of imported goods, leading to internal inflation that adversely affected the mortgage \nmarket.  Those Icelandic mortgages not denominated in foreign currencies were \u2018index-linked\u2019\u2014\nthat is, the value of the loan\u2019s principal was linked to inflation\u2014and when inflation rose to 12.4% \nthe value of mortgagors\u2019 debt increased correspondingly.  The Icelandic residential-mortgage-\n 5 \ndebt-to-GDP ratio increased from 75.5% at the end of 2006 to 129% at the end of 2008 (EMF, \n2009). \n  \nHowever, in the many countries with variable interest rates existing borrowers\u2019 payments fell, \noften by large amounts.  Households whose incomes declined could often still make mortgage \nrepayments, although they still had to deal with serious interest-rate risk since rates could not \nbe expected to stay low indefinitely. \n \nNew borrowers were affected by at least three types of uncertainty and change.  First, even \nthough interest rates fell across the world, the terms and conditions under which new borrowers \ncould obtain a mortgage and the size of the down payment required often made financing more \nexpensive.  Second, although lower prices made house purchases more affordable, the \nexpectation that prices could continue to fall made it riskier to buy \u2013 so markets remained \ndepressed.  Third, uncertainties about future incomes and employment increased the risks for \nmortgagor and mortgagee alike.  Perceptions of risk tend to be pro-cyclical, so when markets \nwere booming risk premia fell but when markets declined risk premia rose and lenders modified \ntheir credit-scoring systems to reduce the credit risk of their loan portfolios. \n \nThese conditions might be expected to produce: \n \n\u2022 a substantial reduction in the overall amount of new lending (reflecting both supply \nconstraints and fall in demand); \n\u2022 large increases in arrears and to a lesser extent foreclosures (as negative income \nshocks hit existing borrowers); \n\u2022 less generous terms for new lending, in particular an increase in the required down \npayment (reflecting uncertainty about both the future value of collateral and borrowers\u2019 \nincomes); and \n\u2022 structural increases in mortgage fees and risk premia.  \n \nGovernment responses to sharp declines in mortgage and housing markets, and to the \npossibility of large-scale defaults which would affect the viability of banking institutions, could \ntherefore be expected to target: \n \n\u2022 the shortage of funds through central bank action or direct intervention by government-\nowned lenders; \n \n\u2022 falls in the value of collateral for new\/existing loans through government guarantee \nschemes; \n \n\u2022 those who experienced income shocks through government assistance with mortgage \npayments for unemployed, sale\/leaseback schemes; and \n \n\u2022 the fall in demand through subsidised loans. \n \nHere we examine evidence on mortgage market developments and \u2018mortgage rescue\u2019 policies \nin the early stages of the crisis.  We do not address wider monetary and fiscal policies, although \nthese measures, in particular the reduction in interest rates, also strongly influenced mortgage \nmarkets. \n \nThe evidence\u2014what happened in individual mortgage markets? \n 6 \n \nNew lending down \n \nThe evidence from the countries examined is generally consistent with the expectations of \nlarge-scale decline.  Table 2 shows the change in gross new residential mortgage lending from \nlate 2007 to late 2008 in thirteen countries.  Data on the number of new loans were available for \nsix of the thirteen; in all six the number of new loans was sharply down.   \n \nThe figures for the value of gross new residential mortgage lending show a similar pattern.  In all \nthirteen countries the value of new lending fell dramatically from late 2007 to late 2008\u2014that is, \nin the period before and just after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.  The \ndeclines ranged from 59% in Ireland to 19% in Australia.  The average decline in new loans was \n41.5%.  This figure gives equal weight to economies of very different sizes, but the average \ndecline for large economies only (the USA, UK and Spain) was almost exactly the same at \n42.2%. \n \nIn some markets declines in the number of mortgage lenders contributed to falls in overall \nlending.  Some lenders made strategic decisions to leave the residential mortgage market; \nsome merged; and some failed.  These structural changes in the banking sector were more \nevident in some countries than in others.  In Finland some Icelandic banks left the market, while \nin Iceland itself the banking sector went through major upheaval, as major banks were \nnationalised.  The Russian banking sector also changed radically:  according to some estimates \nonly 15-20 banks were issuing mortgages in mid-2009, down from more than 500 in mid-2007.   \nThis fall was attributed to the difficulty in securing long-term funding.  In Australia there were \ndeclines in wholesale lending and lending from non-bank lenders (some of which left the \nmarket), as well as mergers among banks; even so, bank lending remained more or less stable.  \nIn the UK some banks and building societies were merged, while others withdrew from the \nmarket reducing the available funds very significantly. In Denmark, on the other hand, the failure \nof some commercial banks had only a minor influence on owner-occupiers\u2019 access to mortgage \nfinance. \n \nTable 2 here \n \nTable 3 shows developments in net new residential mortgage lending in eleven countries.  Net \nnew mortgage lending is defined as gross lending minus repayments and redemptions.  This is \na more important indicator than gross lending, since gross lending fluctuates more than net \nlending because of remortgaging.  Like gross mortgage lending, net lending fell in all countries \nfrom late 2007 to late 2008 but remained in positive territory except in the USA, where \nrepayments and redemptions exceeded new lending by $248bn in 4Q08.   \n \nTable 3 here  \n \nIn those countries for which we have data about both gross and net lending, net lending fell \nabout twice as sharply as gross lending from late 2007 to late 2008.  New borrowing declined, \ndespite very low interest rates that made it cheap to service many mortgages (particularly those \non adjustable or tracker rates).  \n \nMortgage characteristics tougher \n \nThe variety of mortgage products increased in the years up to 2007, with particular growth in \nfeatures such as long term, interest-only and 100% LTV loans (Scanlon et al, 2008).  Post-2007 \n 7 \nwe expect to find fewer of these low-payment products, as they were perceived to expose the \nlender to more risk than standard loan types.  We compared the availability of interest-only and \n100% mortgages in late 2007 and late 2008, and looked at whether lenders had tightened loan-\nto-value, loan-to-income or affordability criteria, increased required down payments or \nshortened maximum mortgage terms.  We also asked whether new loan types had been \nintroduced to deal with the crisis.  The findings for 15 countries are summarised in Tables 4 and \n5.   \n \nTable 4 here \n \nIn most of these countries mortgage lenders became more reluctant to lend (columns 2-4 of \nTable 4).  In view of continued expectations of property-price falls, they required higher down \npayments or equity and cut back or withdrew entirely the supply of very high LTV mortgages \n(100% or more).  Such loans had been common in some markets; in Norway in 2007, 25% of \nnew mortgages had LTVs over 100%. In Spain loans at over 100% LTV, once available, have \ndisappeared.  In Russia 100% LTVs were common but by mid-2009 the maximum was 80%.   \n \nLoan-to-value ratios also fell in countries where maximum LTVs had not reached 100%.  In \nSweden, LTVs of 95% and, by negotiation, more, were commonly available pre-crash; in mid-\n2009 the maximum was 85 to 90%, with less scope for negotiation.  In the UK in November \n2007 the average LTV on new mortgage loans was 80%; in November 2008 it was 75%, but the \nbest rates were available to borrowers with LTVs below 75% or even 60%, depending on the \nlender.   One-hundred percent mortgages had almost disappeared and were perceived to be \none of the causes of the crisis.3 Very high LTV mortgage loans were prohibited in some \ncountries. In Denmark the legal maximum in the specialized mortgage system is 80%, but \nbuyers were often able to get around this by taking out supplementary (secured) loans from \ncommercial banks.   \n \nLoan-to-income or affordability criteria were tightened.  An increase in the value of the collateral \ncould not be relied on to mitigate the effect of a negative income shock for the borrower, and the \neconomic situation made such income shocks more likely than they were before. Surveys of \nbankers provide the evidence: in the Netherlands, according to the Dutch National Bank, 80% of \nbanks tightened their criteria for mortgage lending in some way in the final quarter of 2008 (De \nNederlansche Bank 2009, Table 5.5). This percentage was 17 in the third quarter of 2008, and \nzero in the four previous quarters. In Portugal the central bank\u2019s quarterly survey of the five \nmain banks showed that lending criteria tightened from the third quarter of 2007. In the USA, \naccording to April 2009 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, \u2018about 50% of domestic \nrespondents indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on prime mortgages over \nthe previous three months, and about 65% of the 25 banks that originated non-traditional \nresidential mortgage loans over the survey period reported having tightened their lending \nstandards on such loans\u2019 (Federal Reserve 2009).   \n \nIn some countries lenders cut the maximum mortgage term (column 5). In Iceland, however, the \ngovernment\u2019s rescue package for troubled mortgage borrowers included a provision that would \nincrease the term of the mortgage to up to 70 years in order to reduce monthly repayments (see \nbelow).   \n \nNew loan types (column 6) were not common; rather, mortgage lenders seemed to fall back on \ntraditional lending patterns and products.  In Ireland and Portugal there were some innovations:  \nIn Ireland, a new product targeted consumers fearful of further price drops. The borrower was \noffered at loan at up to 95% LTV. If after five years the value of the property had fallen, the \n 8 \ndeveloper would reimburse the borrower for up to 15% of the drop. In Portugal, one bank \nintroduced a new Euribor tracker mortgage with a minimum interest rate (floor); the initial \nrepayments were lower than for other products.  Also, in the second half of 2008, some property \ndevelopers began to offer loans designed for potential purchasers without a down payment. The \ndeveloper funded up to 30% of the purchase price, repayable in bullet format after a number of \nyears. The amount repayable would be linked to the market value of the property at the time.  \n  \nTable 5 here \n \nThe picture as regards interest-only mortgages is somewhat less clear-cut (Table 5).  These \nproducts were anyway not available in all countries (although in many they were taking an \nincreasing market share up to 2005 and beyond\u2014see Scanlon et al, 2008).  Where they were \navailable, however, by 2009 they accounted for a decreasing percentage of new mortgages. In \nthe UK, for example, some 24% of new loans in 2007 were interest-only with no repayment \nvehicle specified; by the second quarter of 2009 this had fallen to 11% (CML, 2009).  Both \nsupply- and demand-side pressures were involved: the riskier nature of such mortgages as \ncompared to standard annuity products meant that lenders were less inclined to offer them and \nborrowers were more wary of taking them on.   \n \nIn Denmark, on the other hand, the proportion of interest-only mortgages has increased steadily \nsince such loans, with a maximum interest-only period of ten years, were legalised in 2003 and \nthis proportion continued to increase even after house prices turned down (see Figure 1). But \nthe Danish case was an exception. In most countries, loans with such \u2018exotic\u2019 features were \ncurtailed.  This included foreign currency loans, which were very important in some small \neconomies.  Other exotics included long-term loans and self-certification or \u2018no official income \nverification\u2019 loans.  Availability of even relatively common loan products was curtailed; for \nexample, some Danish garantil\u00e5n (variable-rate mortgages with a 5 or 6% interest-rate cap) \ndisappeared from the market for a period because the investors in the bonds that financed them \ndeemed them so risky that their internal rate of return became higher than on ordinary fixed-\ninterest mortgages. \n  \nAvailability of bridging finance was unaffected in some countries, but in others it dried up.  In \nDenmark, commercial banks issue bridging loans when housing markets are operating \n\u2018normally\u2019\u2014that is, when housing prices are increasing\u2014but in general stopped doing so.  In \nFrance LTVs for bridging loans fell; they were previously available for up to 80% but by 2009 \nthis had fallen to 60%.   \n \nArrears and foreclosures \n \nIn all countries studied, borrowers are considered to be seriously in arrears after three months \nof missed payments.  Table 6 shows the change in levels of serious arrears from late 2007 to \nlate 2008 in 11 countries.  Of the eleven countries for which comparative data were available, \nnine experienced an increase in the percentage of serious arrears.  The average increase for all \neleven countries (including those where no increase was seen) was 89% over the period; for the \nlarge economies only (the USA, UK and Spain) the average was 183%. \n \nThe consequences for the borrower of falling into serious arrears are not the same everywhere, \nsince the legal requirements for foreclosure (in the UK formally known as possession and action \nfor sale) and the speed of the court system vary by country.  Many governments announced \nnew policies to help avert foreclosure on borrowers facing payment problems (see below); such \n 9 \npolicies were clearly more relevant in countries where foreclosure proceedings were relatively \nswift and certain.   \n \nTable 6 here  \n \nNegative equity \n \nNegative equity can be defined in different ways. The narrow definition is when the market value \nof a house is less than the outstanding mortgage secured on it. More broadly, an owner-\noccupier household is in negative equity when the value of its assets (including the dwelling) is \nlower than the value of all its liabilities (including the mortgage debt).  \n \nNegative equity does not necessarily lead to arrears or foreclosures\u2014as long as the borrower \ncan maintain their repayments.  It is when borrowers need to sell or remortgage that negative \nequity becomes a problem.  Sellers will owe the lender more than the proceeds of their sale, \nand remortgaging for the same amount might be impossible, so households may be trapped in \nmortgages with high interest rates. \n \nThere are few reliable statistics on the extent of negative equity.  While it is possible to \ndetermine the amount of debt secured on individual properties (although this information may \nnot be publicly available), it is only when a property transaction occurs that the \u2018true\u2019 price of the \ncollateral is established.  Detailed calculations of negative equity thus rely on imputed property \nvaluations, which may differ from the values that would be achieved on the open market.   (See \nHellebrandt and Kawar, (2009) for an exploration of the different methods of calculating \nnegative equity, and its consequences for the wider economy.) \n \nDespite the problems of measurement, it is clear that as house prices fell, the proportion of \nborrowers in negative equity rose across countries.  In Denmark, the frequency of negative \nequity in a broad sense (i.e., all liabilities minus financial assets compared with housing wealth) \nwas fairly stable between 1987 and 2005, when 15% of Danish owner-occupier households \nwere estimated to be in negative equity.  This rose to 40% for households headed by people \naged between 30 and 39, as young households are most likely to be affected by negative equity \n(Lunde, 2007).  In Iceland, 5% of owner-occupier households were estimated to be in negative \nequity in November 2008, up from none a year previously. In Norway, according to calculations \nby the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, about 5% of homeowners were in \nnegative equity in 2008; the estimate for 2007 was 2%.  In the UK, Bank of England research \nsuggested that 7-11% of UK owner-occupier mortgagors were in negative equity in spring 2009, \nalthough in most cases the amounts involved were small \u2013 less than \u00a310,000 (Hellebrandt and \nKawar, 2009).  In Ireland the figure is expected to rise from 15% at the end of 2009 to 25% at \nthe end of 2010 (Duffy, 2010).  In the USA 20% of mortgaged properties were in negative equity \nas of December 2008, according to a firm that holds a large repository of data on US mortgages \n(First American CoreLogic, 2009).   \n  \nThe evidence thus suggests that there were three distinct types of institutional response: \n1. reduced lending across the board as a result of the credit crunch and the closure of \nwholesale markets; \n2. a reassessment of the risks associated with both types of mortgagor and types of \ninstrument, which resulted in the withdrawal of certain products and differential treatment \nof certain kinds of household \u2013 notably first-time purchasers and those with limited \ndeposits.  This appeared to have been based more on assumptions than on detailed \n 10 \nevidence of differential outcomes, but perhaps was a rational way to deal with the \ndecline in the availability of funds;  \n3. a more thoughtful response to arrears and negative equity based on an assessment of \nthe costs and benefits of foreclosure, which suggested that there was often a case for \nmaintaining households in their own homes.  \n \n \nPolicy responses  \n \nGovernments and central banks put in place a range of policies to try to encourage mortgage \nlenders to increase the volume of new lending, and to enable creditworthy new borrowers to \ntake out loans, but the main focus of policy turned in early 2009 to assisting those borrowers in \npayment difficulties to avoid foreclosure. \n \nPolicies directed at increasing new lending included general macroeconomic policies such as \nincreasing the money supply and reducing interest rates: the US Federal Funds rate fell from \n5.26% in March 2007 to 0.18% in May 2009; the Bank of England\u2019s official bank rate fell from \n5.75% in July 2007 to 0.5% in May 2009; and the European Central Bank\u2019s refinancing rate was \nreduced six times from 3.75% in October 2008 to 1.0% in May 2009. 4 In Australia, the Reserve \nBank reduced official interest rates four times between September and December 2008, and put \nsignificant pressure on banks to pass the rate cuts on to borrowers (about 75 per cent of whom \nwere on variable rate loans); Australian housing interest rates fell by 3-4 percentage points over \nthe same period.  As well as reducing interest rates, many central banks carried out market \noperations, purchasing mortgage loans, bonds, mortgage-backed securities, etc., and \naggressively expanded the monetary base.  Governments increased expenditures, particularly \nto assist \u2018troubled\u2019 financial institutions, and thereby strongly increased public-sector deficits. \n \nReductions in interest rates are a faster and more direct way to help most borrowers than \ntargeted benefit programmes for the highly indebted, and by mid-2009 these interest-rate \npolicies had slowed the rates of house price falls and foreclosures.  Low interest rates meant \nlow mortgage repayments, so buyers could afford the monthly payments on more expensive \nhouses.  These low interest rates appeared to have fed through to rising house prices in many \ncountries (as of February 2010); however, there remained a risk of a reversal in this trend when \nrates rose again. \n \nSome governments that took control of or shored up failing banks insisted that in return they \nincrease lending.  The UK government nationalised major mortgage lender Northern Rock in \nFebruary 2008 and initially stopped it issuing new loans, but in February 2009 Northern Rock \nannounced that it would resume new lending.  In Ireland, as part of the recapitalisation scheme \nfor Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, the banks were required to provide an additional 30% \ncapacity for lending to first-time buyers in 2009 (Department of Finance 2009). \n \nGovernment programmes to assist those facing mortgage repayment difficulties \n \nAfter 2007 several governments instituted programmes to help households who encountered \ndifficulties in paying their mortgages.  Such interventions could be justified on several grounds.  \nFirst, owner-occupation is said to generate positive externalities, particularly in borderline \nneighbourhoods, and therefore may be worth preserving with public funds.  Second, by \npreventing possessions the programmes may slow the flow of dwellings coming onto the \nmarket, a flow which increases supply and further depresses prices.  Third, the cost to the state \nof retaining households in owner-occupation may be lower than that of rehousing them; one \n 11 \nstudy showed that 18-25% of households whose homes were placed in possession in England \nwere rehoused by local authorities (Stephens 2009).  Fourth, there is the question of fairness: \nGovernments spent vast sums on assisting ailing financial institutions; many consumers might \nthink it fair for a fraction of this money to go to borrowers themselves. \n \nThere are two main arguments against helping owner-occupiers in this way. First, such \nschemes can lead to moral hazard\u2014that is, by stepping in to avert losses to households, \ngovernments make it more likely that market actors will (continue to) engage in risky behaviour \nin anticipation of future bail-outs.  Second, intervention may delay or distort desirable \nadjustments in consumer behaviour and house prices.  \n  \nThis section describes a selection of policy responses to mortgage-payment problems.  In 2008 \nand 2009, many countries introduced new programmes, or modified existing policies, to try to \nhelp households with difficulties paying their mortgages.  A summary of programmes in various \ncountries appears in Annex 1.  The table is not comprehensive but aims to illustrate the variety \nof approaches taken in seven countries.  Almost all the \u2018mortgage rescue\u2019 programmes had \nlimited budgets--no country could afford to offer unlimited grants and benefit payments to \nowner-occupiers.   Not all of the countries studied had found it necessary, as of early June \n2009, to put such programmes in place; the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland, for example, \nhad none.  \n \nThe goal of most of these programmes was to help borrowers remain in owner-occupation and \nin their homes.  Most of the schemes temporarily reduced borrowers\u2019 mortgage payments.  The \nmost common approach, adopted in five of the countries surveyed, enabled borrowers to defer \na proportion (often 50%) of their payments during the hardship period; the deferred amount was \nnormally added to the loan\u2019s principal.  This was effectively equivalent to a teaser loan and \nwould have the undesirable effect of increasing the financial burden on borrowers when they \ncould resume repayments. And there was a clear repayment risk with such \u2018rescue mortgages.\u2019  \nSuch programmes can be attractive to policy-makers because they require less government \noutlay than direct assistance with mortgage payments, and do not require lenders to write off \nthe loans.  \n \nAnother approach was to offer temporary government assistance with mortgage payments to \nthose who became unemployed.  For example, in the UK the rules were changed to allow a \nshorter waiting period before borrowers could claim Support for Mortgage Interest.  This was \nwithdrawn when the borrower found another job and could again make payments. The \nassistance was an outright grant, not a loan.  There was thus no overhanging financial burden \non the borrower, but such programmes were costly to the public purse. \n \nIn Iceland, a borrower from the Housing Financing Fund who encountered payment difficulties \ncould ask to freeze payments for up to three years.  Other financial institutions had different \nrules, but the government controlled the three largest banks and was expected to standardise \nthe rules on possessions.  In Portugal, a scheme to help unemployed people meet their \nmortgage payments was established in May 2009.  Those unemployed for three months or \nmore could have their mortgage repayment reduced by 50% (maximum reduction 500 Euro) for \nup to 24 months.  This reduction had to be repaid during over the remaining period of the loan, \nat an interest rate of Euribor minus 0.5%. These special conditions were financed by the State. \n \nAnother set of programmes enabled borrowers to remortgage or change the terms of their loan \nto reduce payments, even in cases where lenders would not normally permit this.  In the USA \nunder the Home Affordable Refinance programme households could refinance even if they no \n 12 \nlonger met lenders\u2019 80% loan-to-value requirements because of house price falls.  In Iceland, \nborrowers from the state-owned Housing Financing Fund could turn their overdue debt into a \nnew five- to 30-year loan, or extend the term of their existing loan to up to 70 years. \n \nThese programmes simply enshrined in policy what many lenders were already doing in \npractice.  This continues a trend for removing control of lending practices from the mortgage \nindustry and making it part of official regulations.  In the UK the voluntary industry code was \nsuperseded by the Financial Services Authority\u2019s Mortgage Conduct of Business Sourcebook in \n2004, but even after that the regulator found \u2018weaknesses in responsible lending practices and \nin firms\u2019 assessments of a consumer\u2019s ability to afford a mortgage\u2019 (FSA 2010, p.5). In Ireland, \nthe Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, previously a voluntary industry initiative, was made \nstatutory in February 2009 and some of its terms changed. The Code applies to all mortgage \nlenders and prohibits lenders from initiating court proceedings until the borrower has been in \narrears for six months. \n \nAnother approach was simply to forbid banks from initiating foreclosure proceedings.  In \nIceland, banks were not permitted to take action on loans in arrears until August 2009. In \nIreland, the two banks recapitalized by the government had to agree to hold off starting court \nproceedings for possession until after 12 months after arrears initially appeared as opposed to 6 \nmonths under the official code; this was extended in 2010 to all lenders. \n \nSome analyses have identified the growth in owner-occupation rates over the last decade as \none cause of the crisis. In implicit recognition that some households could not continue to own \ntheir homes, schemes in the UK and Portugal allowed a third party (a housing association in the \nUK; a specially designed investment fund in Portugal) to purchase the dwelling and rent it back \nto the former owner.  Both programmes included provisions whereby the borrower could re-\npurchase the dwelling if their financial circumstances improved, although in the UK this was at \nthe discretion of the purchasing landlord. \n \nNot all mortgage rescue schemes were government programmes; many lenders had their own \ninitiatives to help troubled borrowers, though they may have been encouraged or even forced by \ngovernments to create them.  Governments and lenders sometimes split the financial and \nadministrative burdens of these schemes.  For example, under the USA\u2019s Homeowner Stability \nInitiative, the mortgage payments of troubled borrowers were brought down to 38% of gross \nincome by lenders reducing interest rates.  Government and lenders split the cost of further rate \nreductions to bring payments down to 31% of gross income.  There were financial incentives to \nlenders to modify the loan and to borrowers to keep up payments.5  But generally if troubled \nborrowers were permitted to refinance or renegotiate their loan terms, the lender bore the cost, \nnot government. \n \nThese first versions of mortgage rescue programmes generally did not attempt to address \npayment problems by reducing the principal (value) of the loan6.  Some studies suggest that this \nis the best way to deal with debt problems more generally (Quercia et al, 2009).   There seem to \nbe three reasons why reduction of principal was not widely used.  First, loan forgiveness would \naffect lenders\u2019 balance sheets.  These were already weakened by the financial crisis, and \nfurther deterioration would affect their ability to carry out new lending\u2014which governments \nwanted to encourage. Second, there was an issue of fairness.  It could well be regarded as \nunfair that households that managed to maintain a good payment record, perhaps by making \nsignificant financial sacrifices, should continue to make full mortgage payments while those who \nfell into financial difficulties were \u2018rewarded\u2019 by having their debt reduced.   Third, both debt-\nreduction and payment-reduction policies involve moral hazard:  there would be a strong \n 13 \nincentive for debtors to understate their income or wealth to try to fulfill the conditions for such \nprogrammes.   \n \nThe limited evidence available as of early 2010 suggested that the programmes had not worked \nas well or as quickly as expected. In the USA, the $75bn Home Affordable Modification Program \n(HAMP) started in February 2009 with the goal of facilitating three to four million permanent \nmodifications of mortgage loan contracts by 2012.  Homeowners had to demonstrate over a \nthree-month trial period that they could keep up repayments on the modified loan before the \nchanges were made permanent.  As of end-January 2010 there were about 1 million \u2018trial\u2019 \nmodifications, but only 116,000 permanent ones (US Treasury Department, 2010). Income-\nverification procedures were simplified, as the paperwork originally required was viewed as too \nonerous. \n \nIn England, the Mortgage Rescue Scheme started in January 2009 with a budget of \u00a3285 \nmillion; it was based on a Scottish scheme in existence since 2003 (Bramley et al, 2009).  Its \ngoal was to help 6000 households remain in their homes, which would be purchased (in whole \nor in part) by housing associations.  As of December 2009, more than 15,000 borrowers had \napproached local authorities for assistance but only about a quarter could proceed, as eligibility \nwas limited to households that included someone in \u2018priority need\u2019\u2014essentially small children or \nelderly or disabled people.  Childless adults were not eligible.  Only 182 households had \naccepted an offer under the scheme, while 1294 applications were being processed. \n \nThe relatively low levels of take-up reflected several factors: a failure to communicate with all \neligible households, a complex application process, tight eligibility requirements and the fact that \nmany lenders were exercising forbearance.  In general, however, mortgage payments had \ndeclined because interest rates were lower, meaning demand for these programmes was less \nthan their designers might have anticipated.  But interest rates will rise, and so will the burden \nexerted by mortgage payments on household finances. \n \nIn the period since the data for this paper were collected, regulators have made clear that they \nintend in future to supervise mortgage markets much more stringently and pro-actively than they \ndid before the crisis.  While they acknowledge that mortgage providers have become \ndramatically more conservative in their lending since 2007, regulators want to ensure that the \nnext period of economic growth does not lead to a repetition of risky lending behaviour.  This \nnew approach to regulation takes different forms.  In the EU and the USA, the focus is on \nproviding more and better information to consumers and on ensuring that bankers and brokers \nare not rewarded for selling risky mortgages.  The implicit assumption is that consumers are \nrational and will make correct assessments of risk, given enough information.  In July 2010, the \nEuropean Commission published a working paper on mortgage lending which set out the case \nfor new EU regulations covering information provision and creditworthiness assessment of \nmortgage borrowers, but it specifically excluded \u2018the manner in which mortgage products should \nbe designed\u2019 (EC 2010 p. 3).  \n \nIn the UK, however, the current approach is explicitly paternalistic.  According to the UK\u2019s \nFinancial Services Authority, \u2018Our policy approach to date has been underpinned by a view that \nmortgage consumers will act rationally to protect their own interests.  We believe that we need \nto change that approach, recognize the behavioural biases of consumers and be more \ninterventionist to help protect consumers from themselves\u2019 (FSA 2009). July 2010 it announced \nits intention to require lenders to ensure that borrowers who apply for interest-only mortgages, \nor loans with a term of more than 25 years, could afford to make payments on a 25-year annuity \nmortgage for the same amount.  Lenders may also be required to check that the borrowers have \n 14 \na realistic method of paying off the principal at the end of the loan\u2019s term (FSA 2010). In \naddition, self-certification mortgages, where the borrower does not produce independent \nevidence of income, will be banned.  According to the FSA\u2019s modeling, these changes would \nlead to a reduction in mortgage lending and a consequent fall in house prices. \n \nConclusions \n \nThe dramatic changes in mortgage markets since 2007 stemmed not just from housing market \ndevelopments but also from wider financial and economic events. The proliferation of new types \nof mortgage product was halted, and in some cases reversed, by financial and housing-market \nshocks.  In financial markets such reversals are not unknown.  The literature on financial \nproduct innovation shows that movement towards greater \u2018market completeness\u2019 is far from \nconstant; change is cyclical and related to economic conditions.  \u2018Surely, innovation ebbs and \nflows, with some periods exhibiting bursts of activity and others witnessing a slackening or even \nbacklash\u2026There have been numerous periods throughout the past centuries in which \ninnovation flourished, failures took place, and public and regulatory sentiment led to temporary \nanti-innovation feelings\u2019 (Tufano 2003 p 299).   Most research into financial product innovation \nfocuses on securities markets, but the developments in mortgage markets through the long \nhousing price upturn, and since its end in 2007, seem on the partial evidence presented here to \nbe consistent with the literature in this regard. \n \nDid the mortgage product innovation of the 1990s\/early 2000s (interest-only mortgages, high \nLTVs, high loan-to-income, flexible features, self-certification) make things worse than they \notherwise would have been?  Some of the more general criticisms of financial innovation look \nprescient in light of recent developments in mortgage and housing markets: \u2018There are \narguments that innovation leads to complexity that in turn leads to bad business decisions and \nsocial costs.  One sustained attack on financial innovation is that specific innovations contribute \nto high levels of market volatility, and in particular, to outcomes like market crashes\u2019 (Tufano, \n2003 p. 328). But the evidence assembled in this paper does not permit us to attribute \nresponsibility for the problems in housing and mortgage markets to the product innovations that \npreceded them.  These problems seem to be associated more with how credit worthiness was \nassessed than with particular products.  The very low interest rates prevailing since 2007 have \nclearly benefitted many existing mortgagors.  Moreover, lenders have been more prepared to \nuse forbearance measures because of the extent of the crisis.  As a result there were fewer \npossessions than predicted and some government responses seemed redundant. \n \nIn an effort to stem an expected tide of possessions, many governments devised programmes \nto help borrowers facing payment problems.  Most focused on reducing monthly payments \nthrough lower interest rates, longer mortgage terms and deferred payments; some allowed \nborrowers to sell the home to a social or other institutional landlord but continue to live in it.  The \npractical effect of these programmes appears to date to have been limited, partly because \ndemand was lower than expected because of low interest rates and bank forbearance, but also \nbecause budgets were small, take-up was limited by tight eligibility requirements (introduced in \nan effort to address moral hazard concerns), application procedures were cumbersome and \nthere was a lack of public awareness.  But interest rates will inevitably rise at some point, and \nthere may be more call on mortgage rescue schemes. \n \nA fundamental question about mortgage markets\u2014and markets in general\u2014is whether the \nclassic economic assumptions of rationality hold.  If consumers are capable of making rational \nassessments of financial risk, then providing them with more information about the terms of their \nmortgage contract and what might happen under various scenarios will lead them to make to \n 15 \nbetter decisions.  But the recent body of behavioural economics literature suggests that in fact \nconsumers are often not rational.  Should regulators therefore intervene to protect them from \nthemselves by limiting or banning very risky products, as the FSA has proposed?  By doing so, \nregulators would force consumers to accept the \u2018official\u2019 assessment of risk, even though this \nofficial assessment was not notably accurate in the run-up to the crisis. The FSA also wants to \nensure that lenders remain innovative.  In the previous market cycle, innovation produced riskier \nproducts; the challenge now will be to innovate to reduce risk. \n \nFinally, it is not clear that lenders now have access to enough funds to meet the demand for \nmortgages.  One the one hand, lower interest rates can be expected to increase that demand \nbut on the other, both confidence and consumer and institutional assessment of risk in the \ncurrent uncertain housing market have clearly reduced the capacity for indebtedness. \n 16 \nSources \n \nBramley G, Karley N K, Morgan J, Lederle N, Sosenko F, Stephens M, Wallace A and \nLittlewood M (2008) \u2018Evaluation of the National Mortgage to Rent Scheme\u2019 Scottish Government \nSocial Research available online at \nhttp:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/Doc\/254517\/0075356.pdf \n \nCouncil of Mortgage Lenders (2009) Table ML6c \n \nDavis, E P (1995) Debt, Financial Fragility and Systemic Risk  Oxford: Oxford University Press, \n2nd Edition \n \nDe Nederlansche Bank (2009) Statistical Bulletin, Table 5.5 available online at  \nhttp:\/\/www.dnb.nl\/en\/news-and-publications\/dnb-publications\/statistical-bulletin\/index.jsp   \n \nDepartment of Finance (2009) \u2018Government Announcement: 11 February 2009,   \nRecapitalisation of Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland\u2019 online at  \nhttp:\/\/www.finance.gov.ie\/viewdoc.asp?DocID=5669  \n \nDuffy D (2010) \u201cNegative Equity in the Irish Housing Market\u201d, The Economic and Social Review, \nVol 2, No 1 Spring, pp109-132 \n \nEuropean Commission (2010) Working Paper on Responsible Mortgage Lending and Borrowing  \nBrussels: European Commission \n \nEuropean Mortgage Federation (2009) Hypostat 2008 Brussels: EMF \n \nEuropean Mortgage Federation (Quarterly): Quarterly Review of European Mortgage Markets \n \nFederal Reserve (2009) Senior Loan Office Survey online at  \nhttp:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/BoardDocs\/SnLoanSurvey\/200905\/fullreport.pdf   \n \nFinancial Services Authority (2009) Mortgage Market Review Discussion Paper 09\/3  London: \nFSA  \n \nFinancial Services Authority (2010) Mortgage Market Review: Responsible Lending \nConsultation Paper 10\/16  London: FSA  \n \nFirst American CoreLogic (2009) \u2018Summary of December 2008 Negative Equity Data, 4 March \n2009 online at  \nhttp:\/\/www.loanperformance.com\/infocenter\/library\/FACL%20Negative%20Equity_final_030409.\npdf \n \nGirouard, N, Kennedy M, van den Noord P and Andr\u00e9 C (2006) Recent house price \ndevelopments: The role of fundamentals, Economics Department Working Papers No. 475, \nOECD, ECO\/WKP (2006)3 \n \nGreen, RK, and Wachter, SM (2008): \u201cThe Housing Finance Revolution,\u201d in \nHousing, Housing Finance, and Monetary Policy: Proceedings of the Federal Reserve Bank \nof Kansas City\u2019s Symposium, held at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 30-Sept 1, 2007, \npp. 21\u201367.

USA \nSeveral of the data sources used did not contain information about all 16 countries, so many of the tables \ncover only a subset. \n3 The former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote on 22 February 2009 that he wanted to \u2018control\u2019 new \nmortgages for over 100% of the value of the property (Brown 2009).   \n4 For comparative European mortgage interest rates, see European Mortgage Federation\u2019s Quarterly \nReview of European Mortgage Markets. \n5 Implementation was complicated because many securitisation agreements for mortgages contained \nclauses that limited the ability to change the mortgage terms.  A 2009 Congressional bill to enable courts \nto change mortgage terms over the objections of debt holders (known as \u2018cramdown\u2019) failed to pass.   \n6 This was an option under the USA\u2019s Homeowner Stability Initiative but was not employed; under the \nHome Affordable Modification program, 27.4% of contract modifications included \u2018principal forbearance\u2019 \n(reduction of principal) (US Treasury 2010). \n"}
