Technocratic\nTendencies in Germany,\n1890\u00b11945\nT H O M A S R O H K R A\u00c8 M E R\nSince the `classical' studies of Fritz Stern, Kurt Sontheimer and George Mosse1 the\nview has been wide-spread among historians that a uniquely German tradition of\nromantic `vo\u00c8lkish thinking' and `the politics of cultural despair' contributed to the\ndestruction of the Weimar Republic and the rise of National Socialism. The\npsychological strain of a fast and crisis-ridden industrialisation process is supposed to\nhave provoked an antimodern sentiment in large parts of the population. The\ncritique of modern technology, capitalism and a pluralistic society on the one hand\nand the irrational dream of a harmonious, truly German `community of the people'\non the other allegedly reached its logical culmination in the Nazi ideology of `blood\nand soil', the cult of the charismatic leader and the totalitarian integration of all\n`worthy' members of society, connected with the annihilation of all `unworthy'\nmembers.\nBut this belief in a peculiarly German antimodernism reaching its climax in\nNational Socialism had to raise the question of how, if they had rejected modern\nmeans, the Nazis could have achieved political propaganda successes, economic\nrecovery, the mobilisation of society and spectacular military victories or indeed\nterror and mass extermination. One in\u00afuential answer to this is Jeffrey Herf 's\nconcept of `reactionary modernism' which identi\u00aees the `reconciliation between\nthe antimodernist, romantic, and irrationalist ideas' and `modern technology' as\npeculiar to the radical right in the Weimar Republic and National Socialism.

According to\nHerf, this contradictory combination of reactionary political ideas and a modern\nreliance on instrumental reason and modern means made Nazism possible.2\nIn this article I want to put forward a critique of the concepts `antimodernism'\nand `reactionary modernism'.3 First I will attempt to show that a conservative\nacceptance of technology is not speci\u00aec to the Weimar Republic, but was already\ndominant in imperial Germany. But, secondly, one has to agree with Herf on\nstressing the importance of the First World War for initiating a change in attitude\ntowards a belief that the state has to accept responsibility for the running of the\neconomy and large technological systems. This emergence of an ideology of\ntechnocratic planning will be exempli\u00aeed by looking at two people who expressed\nthese tendencies at length and with exceptional clarity: Walther Rathenau and\nErnst Ju\u00c8nger. This concentration on a couple of \u00aegures to illustrate a more general\ntrend of the time is obviously problematic and provokes the legitimate question of\ntheir representativeness (even though they were undoubtedly very in\u00afuential in\ntheir time). But as the article is mainly concerned with critically evaluating theories\nof historians which causally link intellectuals and the reality of the Third Reich,\nthe procedure seems appropriate for the task at hand. Nevertheless, it should be\nseen simply as a device enabling me to deal with a broad topic in the limited space\nof an article.4\nAfter establishing the main features of the new attitude towards technology\nemerging after the First World War and shaping the thinking of the new right in\nthe Weimar Republic, it will then be, thirdly, compared with the National\nSocialists' attitude. I will try to show that the Third Reich, while largely accepting\ntechnology, was much less technocratically oriented than the `modernists' of the\nWeimar Republic. Avoiding any kind of purism, their pragmatic and often\ninconsistent use of technology is closer to the traditional attitude of the nineteenth\ncentury than to Ernst Ju\u00c8nger's enthusiastic embrace of technology in all its systemic\nconsequences.\nIn concluding, I will re\u00afect on the impact of my analysis on the concepts of\n`antimodernism' and `reactionary modernism'.\n2 Jeffrey Herf, Reactionary Modernism (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 1 f. See\nalso the more recent restatement of his theory in `Der nationalsozialistische Technikdiskurs. Die\ndeutschen Eigenheiten des reaktiona\u00c8ren Modernismus', in Wolfgang Emmerich and Carl Wege, eds.,\nDer Technikdiskurs in der Hitler-Stalin-A\u00c8 ra (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1995), 72\u00b193.\n3 While many social theorists have become convinced that National Socialism is a modern\nphenomenon, the belief in its antimodern character is still widespread among historians. See for\nexample `Technik', in Wolfgang Benz et al., eds., Enzyklopa\u00c8die des Nationalsozialismus, (Munich: DTV,\n1997).\n4 My new book, Einer andere Moderne? Zivilisationskritik, Natur und Technik in Deutschland, 1880\u00b1\n1933, (Paderborn: Schoeningh, 1999) deals at length with social movements expressing these techno-\ncratic tendencies.\n30 Contemporary European History\nIThe combination of a reactionary political orientation and a fully-\u00afedged accep-\ntance of technology can strike one as `paradoxical'5 only if one believes with Jeffrey\nHerf that technology is normally accepted by liberals, democrats or socialists and\nrejected by reactionaries. This assumption has some plausibility, if we take reaction\nto mean the political attempt to turn back the clock and restore a past society. But\nsince neither the radical right in the Weimar Republic nor National Socialism\nharked back to a previous epoch, we have to interpret the term `reactionary' in this\ncontext more loosely as authoritarian and right-wing. Can we really say that these\npolitical groups tend to have a problem with instrumental reason and technology?\nIt only takes a cursory glance at developing countries in the past and present to\nrealise that anti-democratic and anti-liberal authoritarianism frequently goes to-\ngether with efforts towards technological modernisation. This is also the case in\nregard to imperial Germany, where technological progress was largely accepted.\nMost of those social groups and individuals which were denounced as Luddites and\nenemies of progress both by progressive liberals of the time6 and by later historians,\ndid not reject technology as such, but only particular aspects of technological\ndevelopment which threatened their material existence.7 The largest agrarian\ninterest group `Bund der Landwirte' did not \u00aeght industrialisation as a whole, but\naimed for an `agrarian and industrial state';8 the leader of the Pan-Germans, Heinrich\nClass, warned of the dangers connected with ruthless industrialisation, but in\nprinciple accepted its `necessity';9 and scientists, stressing the need of a large rural\npopulation to keep up a high birth-rate, accepted that parts of the population\nsurplus had to migrate into the cities to keep up industrial production.10 The\nmilitary did not reject modern means, but accepted technological change on an\nunprecedented scale. New line-of-battle ships and submarines, smokeless gun-\n5 Herf claims: `It is paradoxical to reject the Enlightenment and embrace technology at the same\ntime.' `With the exception of the reactionary modernists, those who rejected the Enlightenment and its\nlegacy rejected technology, whereas those who defended the Enlightenment accepted the need for\ntechnical development' (Herf, Reactionary Modernism, 3, 42).\n6 For example J. Wernicke, Der Kampf um den wirtscha\u00afichen Fortschritt ( Jena: Gustav-Fischer Verlag,\n1910). In the following I will keep the references to a minimum, as this will be dealt with in detail in\nmy forthcoming book (see footnote 4).\n7 Agriculture, for example, used romantic notions to gain support in their \u00aeght for protective tariffs,\nbut they simultaneously increased their production in the German empire by 73% and their productivity\nby 40% (H.-U. Wehler, Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte 1849\u00b11914 (Munich: Beck, 1996), 1266, 685 f.).\nFor the reaction of craftsmen see W. Ko\u00c8nig, `Massenproduktion und Technikkonsum.

In Sunday\nspeeches they stressed the importance of the `spiritual' in contrast to the vulgar\n`material', but in everyday life they `obviously needed engineers' and industry and\nwere quite conscious of this.13 Even the youth movement, which is often cited as a\nprime example of a \u00afight away from the industrial present, did not want to turn\naway from modernity. They enjoyed their hiking and appreciated nature, but they\nexplicitly rejected the `nature enthusiasm of the eighteenth century' and Rousseau's\n`return to nature'14 and visited large cities and industrial sites on their tours through\nthe country.15 And, as I have tried to show elsewhere,16 even critics of civilisation\ndid not reject technology completely, but tried to \u00aend ways to use it in accordance\nwith their ideas of a natural and cultured society.\nII\nPeople realised the importance of technology before 1914, but the First World War\nnevertheless came as a shock because it fundamentally questioned the widespread\nbelief that technology was an occasionally dif\u00aecult but potentially obedient servant\nof humanity. Not only the common soldiers in combat felt the overwhelming\npower of modern weapons, but so also did the military and political leadership, who\nwere forced to change all of their plans to adapt to the realities of industrial and\ntechnological warfare. Strategies had to take account of the superiority of means of\ndefence, and the long duration of the war, combined with the increased demand for\nmilitary material, forced all belligerent nations to mobilise every sector of society.\nWar was no longer a matter solely of the military sector as scienti\u00aec achievements,17\nthe potential for industrial production and the mental preparedness for war were at\n11 If the military was sceptical about new technologies, it was largely because they could not see its\npotential and were afraid of investing in a \u00afop. But problems and mistakes in evaluating new technology\nshould not be confused with a general scepticism about new technology.\n12 Most in\u00afuential is Fritz Ringer, The Decline of the German Mandarins (Cambridge, MA: Harvard\nUniversity Press, 1969).\n13 Friedrich Dessauer, Streit um die Technik (Frankfurt\/M.: Verlag Josef Knecht, 1956), 24.\n14 Quoted in Jakob Mu\u00c8ller, Die Jugendbewegung als deutsche Hauptrichtung neukonservativer Reform\n(Zu\u00c8rich: Europa Verlag, 1971), 35.

As nitrogen, which had been largely imported before 1914, was\nessential for the production of fertilisers and explosives, Britain's naval blockade might well have led to a\nquick Allied victory, if science and technology had not provided a way to produce it arti\u00aecially.\n32 Contemporary European History\nleast as important for success as the armed forces themselves. These developments\nseriously questioned previous hopes by the German empire to subordinate modern\nmeans to traditional forms and ideals. The pressure to attempt total mobilisation in\nmodern warfare forced nations to accept the industrial and technological logic\nunreservedly, that is to say, with all the often unwanted consequences a strong focus\non ef\u00aeciency implied.\nA good example of the change of attitude in leading circles is Walther\nRathenau.18 He was a leading protagonist in the new electrical industry and also\nshowed ambitions in the political sphere. In 1914 he was put in charge of organising\nthe change from a peacetime to a war economy. Although Rathenau only stayed in\nof\u00aece until he had implemented an organisational structure, he unquestionably\nplayed a crucial role in preparing Germany for a longer war by establishing public\ncontrol over the commercial use of scarce raw materials. In enabling the economy\nto cope with the trade blockade, his organisation made Germany's war effort\nsustainable over a longer period of time.\nRathenau was not only a leading man in the practical world, but also a prominent\ncritic of modern civilisation. In his numerous pre-war publications he lamented the\ndestruction of historic buildings, the decline of artistic production and even the\nreplacement of a courageous and honourable nobility by a more pragmatic,\npositivistic and materialistic propertied middle class.19 While Rathenau accepted\nwhat he called `mechanisation' (that is modern technology, instrumental reason and\nthe drive for ef\u00aeciency), regarding technological development as necessary to feed a\ngrowing population, he attacked the concomitant cultural and social developments\nof modern societies. His hope and belief was that the human soul could overcome\nthese shortcomings in the future by replacing the motivation of material egoism in\nthe economy by a motivation through love, respect for others and a sense of duty\ntowards society. Not different institutions or material changes, but a different\nattitude (service to the nation instead of capitalist competition) would make it\npossible to realise a higher form of existence combining the achievements of\ntechnology with a renewed emphasis on moral values, a just and humane society,\nartistic productivity and a harmonious national culture.\nWith the First World War, this organiser of war industry fundamentally revised\nhis world view, moving from pleading for a moral revival to advocating technocratic\nstate measures. For Rathenau, the development towards a directed economy with\nstronger state involvement was not just an ad hoc wartime measure, but the\nbeginning of a fundamental change which would destroy `the gods which the world\nbefore August 1914 had worshipped'.20 He expected the competitive principle of\n18 A reliable biography is Ernst Schulin, Walther Rathenau (Go\u00c8ttingen: Muster-Schmidt Verlag,\n1979).\n19 Walther Rathenau, `Mechanik des Geistes oder vom Reich der Seele`, in Rathenau, Hauptwerke\nund Gespra\u00c8che, (Munich: Gotthold Mu\u00c8ller Verlag, 1977), 236; Rathenau, `Kritik der Zeit' in Rathenau,\nHauptwerke und Gespra\u00c8che, 24, 34 f.\n20 Rathenau in a letter to Hermann Stehr (14 Aug. 1914) quoted in Ernst Schulin, `Zu Rathenaus\nHauptwerken' in Rathenau, Hauptwerke und Gespra\u00c8che, 558.\nAntimodernism, Reactionary Modernism and National Socialism 33\ncapitalism to make room for a social economy (Gemeinwirtschaft) characterised by\nstronger state control, corporate structures and extensive social regulations. His pre-\nwar belief in ethical change was replaced by the technocratic vision that an\nimproved organisation of national economy would overcome the problems of\n`mechanisation'. The future would see the emergence of a large semi-governmental\neconomic structure which was supposed to combine entrepreneurial freedom with\nextensive controls by the state to ensure the common good.\nThe practical changes Rathenau proposed could not satisfy true socialists, but\nwere surprisingly radical for a member of the bourgeoisie. He demanded an\n`extensive, in parts nearly prohibitive, system of income duties, taxes and levies' to\nrestrict luxury consumption, the prevention of speculation through controls and\ntaxes, an extremely progressive property and income tax and the prohibition of\nevery inheritance `above a moderate property'.21 Social mobility should also be\nincreased to give every citizen equal career opportunities,22 both to increase social\njustice and to make more ef\u00aecient use of the nation's human potential. The state\nwas supposed to ensure that priority was given to the common good. As `the\neconomy is not a private, but a public matter', the state should have extensive\npowers to prevent any inef\u00aecient, egoistic and malevolent use of entrepreneurial\nfreedom.23 The government should make it its policy to enforce the highest possible\nef\u00aeciency by centralising power generation and distribution, by improving produc-\ntivity in industry through enforcement of rationalisation programmes (including the\nclosing down of inef\u00aecient production sites), by reducing the existing variety to a\nfew standardised products, and by organising distribution more ef\u00aeciently by\nreplacing the many small retailers by a few large warehouses. In short, Rathenau\ndeveloped a comprehensive technocratic programme for a state-directed economy.\nHis aim was an ethically superior and more ef\u00aecient society, where the state ensured\nthe primacy of public over private interest. His practical measures had little to do\nwith his earlier idealist hopes or with the interests of an individual capitalist, but\ndescribed a whole national economy and society arranged according to the\norganisational principles of a large and ef\u00aecient company.\nRathenau's ideas were new and original, but his rapid reorientation as well as the\npublic interest in his ideas were partly due to the fact that the ground had already\nbeen prepared before the war. Many technically minded people had long been\nsceptical of capitalism. It seemed to hinder the realisation of important technical\nideas due to a capitalist demand for short-term pro\u00aets, seemed to get in the way of\nan ef\u00aecient economy of scale, because the same goods were produced in different\ncompanies, and seemed to promote wasteful aberrations because of a lack of\nplanning. For technicians and engineers it was only logical to develop the vision of a\nnational economy organised as a single ef\u00aecient machine. Furthermore, the German\nempire was marked by a change towards corporate capitalism, with many companies\n21 Rathenau, `Von kommenden Dingen', in Rathenau, Hauptwerke und Gespra\u00c8che, 370, 373.\n22 Rathenau, `Von kommenden Dingen', 368.\n23 Rathenau, `Von kommenden Dingen', 348.\n34 Contemporary European History\nmerging or forming cartels. The electrical industry especially tried to pro\u00aet from\neconomy of scale in production of electrical equipment, from the higher ef\u00aeciency\nof larger power stations and from a more balanced load when supplying power to\nlarge areas and diverse customers. The economic advantage of large `networks of\npower',24 the close cooperation with the state to establish monopolies whereby the\ncoexistence of several parallel electrical networks could be avoided, the need for\ncooperation between different companies and banks to \u00aenance investments on an\nunprecedented scale, all this offered experiences which suggested that the trend was\ntowards concentration and planning and that a national economy might also pro\u00aet\nfrom replacing the chaos of competition by a larger economic strategy.\nBut there was also powerful opposition to a planned national economy. The\nlarge majority of employers, whilst being open to the merging of companies, to\ncartels and to agreements with the state to avoid damaging competition and achieve\nreliable conditions for investments, was eager to maintain capitalist independence.\nThe exceptional situation of a war made them prepared to accept a state role in\neconomic matters, but only as a strictly temporary emergency measure. Faced with\nthe widespread public interest in the ideas of Rathenau25 and like-minded people\nsuch as the economists Wichard von Moellendorf, Gerhart von Schulze-Gaevernitz,\nEdgar Jaffe\u00c2 and Werner Sombart, as well as the political scientist Johann Plenge,\nemployers started a big campaign attacking the measures `against which the most\nradical demands of socialist revolutionaries appear comparatively harmless'26 and\ndemanding the speedy return to a peacetime economy.27\nA continuation of the war economy after 1918 never stood a real chance.\nEmployers and trade unions opposed it both in principle and because it had led to\ngross mismanagement and social injustices. But the ideas nevertheless maintained\ntheir importance in the Weimar Republic because they remained attractive among\ncivil servants, the military and the middle class. They promised a third way between\nMarxist socialism and an unrestricted market economy, similar to that for which the\nimperial Verein fu\u00c8r Sozialpolitik (Association for Social Policy) had searched; they\npromoted a strong state overcoming class divisions and the most severe social\ninjustices, an idea particularly attractive to all those middle-class groups afraid of a\nrevolution and of being squashed between the powerful employers' and working-\nclass organisations; they raised the hope that a competitive society based on self-\ninterest could be replaced by a more humane cooperative and `organic' society; and\nthey promised nationalistically and militaristically minded people the possibility of\npreparing Germany for a new and more successful war.

For the promoters of a state-directed social economy the\nchanges needed to cope with the demands of the First World War proved the\nsuperiority of their model. Despite all the problems connected with the war\neconomy, for which they largely blamed the improvised character of the measures,\nthey were convinced that the dif\u00aecult times had proved the need for more planning.\nOnly a state-directed economy would be able to cope with the demands of a long\nwar of attrition in the industrial age. The deprivation of the population and the\ndesolate state of the economy in 1918 were negligible in this line of argument in\ncomparison with the state economy's ability to maintain the war effort for four\nyears.\nThe belief in a state-directed social economy was not limited to the political\nright. Engineers of different political persuasions continued with their complaints\nthat capitalism would thwart the potential of modern technology through its narrow\nfocus on short-term pro\u00aets;28 demands for the rule of technical competence over\nthe whole of society were voiced29 and the economic crisis of 1929 saw the\nemergence of a technocratic movement which wanted to replace a capitalist by a\ntechnological logic.30 But it was on the political right that technocratic ideas were\nmainly justi\u00aeed with reference to the First World War and the demands of modern\nwarfare in general. Large parts of the so-called `Conservative Revolution' (that is,\nthe radical right who wanted to develop an up-to-date ideology for an authoritarian\nstate instead of dreaming about a way back to the German empire) were convinced\nthat Germany could re-emerge as a powerful nation only if it accepted economic\nand technical imperatives without reservation.31 Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, the\nold man of the Conservative Revolution, unhesitatingly incorporated modern\nindustry and technology into his `German socialism' (a concept which shows many\nparallels with the war economy);32 the philosopher Oswald Spengler urged the\n28 See for example the in\u00afuential engineers Alois Riedler, Schenk, Weyrauch and Friedrich\nDessauer as well as the position of the engineers' organisation VDI.\n29 Most importantly by the Reichsbund Deutscher Technik and engineers such as Dessauer.\n30 Stefan Willeke, Die Technokratiebewegung in Nordamerika und Deutschland zwischen den Weltkriegen\n(Frankfurt\/M.: Lang, 1995).

He is rather sceptical of technology and tries to \u00aend ways for its control (`Za\u00c8hmung'), for\nexample a strict control of the implementation of technology to avoid bothersome noise, dis\u00aegurement\nof the countryside and damage to human health, as well as a cultural committee with the power of\nbanning inventions which are not bene\u00aecial to society (Werner Sombart, Deutscher Sozialismus,\nCharlottenburg: Buchholz & Weisswange, 266).\n32 Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Das Dritte Reich, 3rd edn., (published 1922) (Hamburg:\nHanseatische Verlagsanstalt, 1931), especially 116 ff.

A sense of national duty seems not to have motivated him,37\nbut the hope of \u00aending his `true self ' and a more `elemental reality' outside\nbourgeois society. This hope and desire to engage on an adventurous journey to\ndiscover one's authentic existence beyond the allegedly false conventions of civilised\nsociety was not a `premodern' notion, but an expression of a `romantic individu-\nalism' originating in the artistic way of life of early romanticism, giving the central\nmotif to many modern writings and representing a common ambition for the avant-\ngarde and life reform movements at the turn of the century.38 In a similar vein,\nJu\u00c8nger believed that society in the `mechanical age' restricted the potential of a\nmuch richer self, while a more authentic life promised the discovery of one's own\nindividuality and the experience of the `multitude of life, its diversity and the\nglowing beauty of its intoxications'.39\nBut Ju\u00c8nger was quickly forced to realise that his naive notions of a warrior's life\nhad little in common with modern warfare.

The demands of\nmodern warfare were even more restrictive than modern society. Material neces-\nsities dominated over idealistic notions of self-realisation. As Ju\u00c8nger was forced to\nadmit: `The emotions of the heart and the systems of the mind can be disproved,\nwhile a material object cannot be disproved \u00b1 and such a material object is a\nmachine gun.' `Free will, education, enthusiasm and ecstatic contempt of death are\nnot enough to overcome the gravity of a few hundred metres, over which the\nmagic of mechanical death reigns.'40 Warfare in the industrial age turned out to be\njust another example of a contradiction inherent in the project of modernity: the\nmodern concept of realising one's own potential and developing a singular\nindividuality clashed with the power of `second nature'; the technical apparatus\ndesigned to overcome natural limitations developed its own momentum and\nrestricted human freedom by demanding the adaption to a technological logic of\naction. The desire for adventure and emotional intensity is an integral part of\nmodernity, but for achieving success the industrial world demands \u00b1 in war as much\nas in peace \u00b1 the precise work of every soldier or worker as a small cog in a large\ntechnical system.\nAs Ju\u00c8nger did not want to accept the role of a Don Quixote, he was forced to\naccept the challenge of modern technology. Inspired by Nietzsche, he could not\nreject technology, which was clearly the prime instrument of the human `will to\npower' in modern times.41 As there was no escape from the all-pervasive power of\ntechnology, he had to \u00aend a way of integrating it into his world-view. The\nacceptance that it was not the `abilities of the individual' which counted in\nmodernity (in particular in modern warfare), but `production, level of technology,\neducation and railway systems'42 was a dif\u00aecult step for Ju\u00c8nger as it challenged his\nhope and desire for a less civilised space in which one could realise an adventurous\npath of life. Technology confronted Ju\u00c8nger with a fundamental dilemma: it appeared\nto be part of an oppressive modernity suffocating all human desire for adventure and\nindividual challenges, but at the same time it seemed to be the up-to-date expression\nof human vitality which was unscrupulous in choosing the most effective means for\nachieving its goals. On the one hand, he admitted a `deep fear' of modern\ntechnology,43 but on the other, his Nietzschean convictions (`amor fati') forced him\nto embrace all aspects of the modern condition. After a laborious struggle which\n\u00aends re\u00afection in the many different opinions expressed in his early writings,44 he\n40 Ernst Ju\u00c8nger, Der Arbeiter.

Different technical means could not be employed by any person for any\npurpose, but only by people prepared to accept fully all demands of the technical\nage, because individual technical means are part of an interdependent technical\nsystem and cannot exist in isolation. Furthermore he developed the conviction that\na productive engagement with technology demanded a certain `language'. As users\nhave to follow a certain code to live in the technical world and make use of\ntechnical means, modernity turns them not `just into subjects of technical processes,\nbut simultaneously into their objects'. `The application of these [technological]\nmeans demands a speci\u00aec lifestyle, which encompasses every single aspect of life.\nTechnology is thus by no means a neutral force, no reservoir of effective and simply\nconvenient means, which any traditional power can take from at pleasure'.47 The\nFirst World War had taught Ju\u00c8nger an important lesson which the Weimar\nRepublic could only reinforce: that modern technology places precise demands on\nits users, produces unintended results and becomes a force in its own right, shaping\nhistory in unexpected and often unwanted ways. More than the critics of civilisation\nin the German empire who had aimed for a technology controlled by traditional\nsociety, Ju\u00c8nger was aware of the inevitable price one had to pay for using\ntechnology.\nSecondly, the First World War had radicalised the German right. The group of\n`soldierly nationalists' in particular was more extreme in its militarism and expan-\nsionism than any pre-war group. Ernst Ju\u00c8nger and the people around him had no\ndoubt that the re-establishment of German power had to be the central political\ngoal. They were convinced about the primacy of a foreign policy based on power\nand were prepared to implement all domestic changes necessary for strengthening\n45 Ernst Ju\u00c8nger, `Ober\u00afa\u00c8che-Tiefe.

The establishment of a planned economy, the introduction of a national\nsocialism or the organisation of society according to military principles: all these\nmeasures were considered and adopted, because they promised to increase Germa-\nny's might. As Ju\u00c8nger believed that modern technology faced every modern human\nbeing with an `inescapable either-or' of making full use of it or perishing, he was\nforced to opt for the unlimited use of technology as a necessary means of any\nef\u00aecient nationalistic and militaristic policy.\nThroughout his work Ernst Ju\u00c8nger repeated the diagnosis of many critics of\ncivilisation: the ascendancy of industry and technology had meant a `total revolu-\ntion' producing anonymous cities and a uniform society, destroying all individuality\nin human beings and leading to a growing alienation from the natural world.48 But\nwhile his acceptance of technology had been fatalistic throughout most of his life\n(both before 1925 and after the early 1930s), the late Weimar Republic saw a\ncomplete turn from forced acceptance to enthusiasm. In Der Arbeiter (`The\nWorker'), his main work on technology published in 1932, Ju\u00c8nger blamed the\nwrong attitude of the middle class for the shortcomings of modernity. He believed\nthat it was only their inability to adapt fully to the logic of technology that had led\nto a loss of control over the modern world. Filled with optimism that history was on\nhis side, he expected that the coming full acceptance of technology would overcome\nits negative effects. A new type of human being would be in tune with technology\nand succeed in creating a harmonious world of humans and machines.\nJu\u00c8nger's vision of the future was clearly in\u00afuenced by different developments of\nthe interwar years which all seemed to point in a similar direction. He accurately\nrecognised a general trend towards more planning under many different ideological\nguises. The economies in the First World War in all the belligerent countries, the\ntechnocratic movement in the United States, the development towards larger\ncompanies and more state intervention in capitalist nations (especially as a conse-\nquence of the world economic crisis), corporatist structures in fascist Italy, \u00aeve-year\nplans and forced industrialisation in the Soviet Union, all seemed to suggest that the\nworld was moving from an individualistic free-market economy to a collective and\nplanned one. Taking these trends to their logical conclusion, Ju\u00c8nger proclaimed that\nthe `chaos' produced by economic liberalism would be replaced by a `planned\neconomy', achieving an `organic construction, that is a close and con\u00afict-free\nmerging of life with all the means it has at hand'. A group of experts employed by\nthe state would organise the technological world like one large machine and\nconsequently overcome the problems of the present.49\nMany readers are left confused by the fact that Ju\u00c8nger avoids any clear political\nstance. His description could \u00aet a fascist or bolshevist as well as an interventionist\ncapitalist system. But this openness is not an omission, it is a central component of\nJu\u00c8nger's argument. He was convinced that the political differences were nothing but\nsurface phenomena, that is different labels for one fundamental change towards\n48 Ju\u00c8nger, Arbeiter, 162 (quotation), 61, 94, 98, 102 ff., 213.\n49 Ju\u00c8nger, Arbeiter, 68, 290, 226, 281.\n40 Contemporary European History\nincreased planning. What he both diagnosed and welcomed was the emergence of a\nnew order (\u00aerst on the national, later also on the global level), where nature, human\nbeings and machines would be united in one large technological system.50\nWhile the First World War had forced Ernst Ju\u00c8nger to accept modern technology,\nhis belief in the power of technology to determine a whole culture made him\nwelcome it. He hated modern society for its lack of order and its pluralism, diversities\nand contradictions and valued modern technology's alleged ability to overcome this\nchaos. For him it was positive, if technological logic could replace chaos by order, as\nhe simply preferred any kind of order over any kind of disorder. Although he\ncontinued to dislike some aspects of technology, the conservative wish for a\nhomogeneous culture triumphed.51\nBut who would be the carrier of all these far-reaching changes? Ju\u00c8nger's answer is\nthe `worker', by which he means every person for whom work is the centre of\nexistence. While previous social groups had wanted to use technology for other\nmeans (the bourgeoisie, for example, for material bene\u00aets), this new type of human\nbeing would be interested in work and ef\u00aeciency for its own sake. As Ju\u00c8nger states:\nin the age of the `worker' there will be nothing, `that will not be interpreted as\nwork. Work is the speed of the \u00aest, the thought of the heart, life day and night,\nscience, love, the arts, religion and cults, war; work is the movement of atoms and\nthe power which moves stars and solar systems'.52 In an act of `heroic realism', the\nnew human beings would accept the reality of the future world, abandoning any\nwish for pleasure and comfort and dedicating their whole life to work and interpret\nall events, human as well as non-human, as work.\nIn parts, Ju\u00c8nger's belief in the emergence of a universe dominated by work and\nfunctionality re\u00afects the experience of the modern world that these secondary\nvalues become goals in themselves (the glori\u00aecation of work and ef\u00aeciency, the\nmania in sports to achieve new records, the continued effort of rich people to make\nmoney beyond anything they can ever spend, the race to the moon, etc.). But for\nhim it is also a translation of Nietzsche's beliefs into the present, as he sees dedication\nto work motivated by the `will to power'. Ju\u00c8nger's worker does not want luxury or\ncomfort, but the feeling of having an impact and shaping reality. The eventual\noutcome is secondary to the joy of ef\u00aeciently achieving a task, that is experiencing\none's competence and power.\nThis new type of human being will eventually triumph, because his life is solely\ndevoted to work. As traditional social groups want to use technology for dysfunc-\ntional goals such as an increase in consumption and physical wellbeing, they will be\nless powerful than the worker who is only aiming for an increase in ef\u00aeciency and\n50 Technology should not be understood in the narrow sense, but should also include organisational\nstructures (factories, educational systems etc.) necessary to make the system work.\n51 `The proof of this legitimation is given by controlling the things which have become all-\npowerful' ( Ju\u00c8nger, Arbeiter, 76). The idea that any power legitimises itself by its capability of establishing\norder is developed more thoroughly in the work of Carl Schmitt (see for example his book Der\nLeviathan).\n52 Ju\u00c8nger, Arbeiter, 65.\nAntimodernism, Reactionary Modernism and National Socialism 41\npower. He is able to merge himself with technology and give coherent shape to the\ntechnological age, because he has an instrumental attitude to everything: all natural\nphenomena, all machines, even his own body and mind are just raw materials. They\nare turned into ef\u00aecient machines and components of an ever more powerful\ntechnical system. The result is an endless increase in ef\u00aeciency and power largely for\nits own sake.\nIf one believes in the emergence of the `worker', then it is only plausible to\nexpect that this new kind of human being will triumph over less single-minded\npeople. As they are more determined in aiming for their goals, the workers will be\nable to realise their vision of a functional society. But since clusters of the new type\nof human being are simultaneously emerging at different places, trying to realise\ntheir own ambitions against those of other groups, Ju\u00c8nger envisaged a violent future\nwith a whole `succession of wars and civil wars'.53 The workers' expansionist power\npolitics make major military con\u00aficts inevitable, and these con\u00aficts in their turn will\nreinforce the pressure to sacri\u00aece everything for ef\u00aeciency's sake just to maintain\none's existence. Communities or states will have to mobilise as fully as possible.\nThey will be turned from passenger liners into battleships, work and war will\nbecome identical and every citizen will become a combatant.54 Ju\u00c8nger even foresaw\nkamikaze \u00aeghters, envisaging the merging of heroic men and machines (an `organic\nconstruction') in torpedoes directed by human pilots.55\nWith this vision of the future, Ernst Ju\u00c8nger could combine his appreciation of the\npower of technology with his desire for adventure by imagining an immense global\ndrama of war and creation. While the struggle of creation could satisfy his wish for\nself-realisation, the order which was to follow ful\u00aelled his conservative dreams for a\nstable and homogeneous society. But what is more important in this context is that\nJu\u00c8nger is not untypical of trends in right-wing thought in the Weimar Republic: the\ndemand for total mobilisation to revise the Versailles Treaty and to ful\u00ael Germany's\nglobal ambitions often led to an unreserved acceptance of, or even enthusiasm for,\nthe potential of technical means. The primacy of foreign policy ambitions implied\nthe embrace of all means necessary to realise those ambitions, and most nationalists\nin the Weimar Republic realised that modern technology played a crucial part in\nany expansionist scheme.\nIII\nWe can thus conclude that Herf is right in stressing the right-wing acceptance of\ntechnology in the Weimar Republic. There is a general tendency towards more\nplanning, economic concentration and rationalisation (directed or planned econo-\nmies in fascist and communist countries, more state interventions in capitalist\nsystems in the First World War and after, economic concentration into ever\n52 Ju\u00c8nger, Arbeiter, 75.\n54 Ju\u00c8nger, Arbeiter, 75, 109.\n55 Ju\u00c8nger, `U\u00c8 ber den Schmerz' in Ernst Ju\u00c8nger, ed., Bla\u00c8tter und Steine, (Hamburg: Hanseatische\nVerlagsanstalt, 1934), 176 f.\n42 Contemporary European History\nlarger corporations, the debate about Taylorism, Fordism and Americanisation,\nin\u00afuential technocratic movements especially during the world economic crisis,\netc.),56 and some intellectually alert groups of the extreme right tried to integrate\nthis trend into their world view. The phenomenon is neither as new nor as\nsurprising or contradictory as Herf argues, but there is clearly a new quality in the\nunreserved acceptance of all aspects of technology. But now we come to question\nthe last point of his argument: does National Socialism really \u00aet into this tradition?\nIs it as technocratic as Walther Rathenau and as techno-enthusiastic as Ernst\nJu\u00c8nger?\nWhile racism, one of the core elements of National Socialism, played no part in\nErnst Ju\u00c8nger's thinking,57 there is undoubtedly a far-reaching similarity in their\nextreme nationalism, militarism and anti-liberal authoritarianism. But what about a\nconnection between Ju\u00c8nger's attitude towards technology and National Socialism?\nThe opinions of the time were divided. While the Nazi press reviewed Ju\u00c8nger's\n`Worker' rather critically,58 a biography of him published in 1934 stressed the debt\nNational Socialism owed to Ju\u00c8nger in learning to accept modern technology:\n`Thanks to Ernst Ju\u00c8nger, technology is no longer a problem for the German youth\n. . . Ju\u00c8nger has freed us from a nightmare.'59 But to claim such a direct in\u00afuence of\none individual writer on a whole political movement is problematic,60 as the\ngrowing acceptance of technology was a much more general phenomenon on the\nextreme right of the Weimar Republic. What I will be concerned with is not a\ncausal relation, but the question of similarities and differences between a position\nlike Ernst Ju\u00c8nger's and that of National Socialism.\nThe debate about the relationship between National Socialism and modernity\/\nmodernisation, which started in the 1960s and which has \u00afared up again over the\nlast decade,61 has left many controversial points unresolved, but it has shown very\nclearly that most leading National Socialists accepted modern technology or were\neven enthusiastic about it. Hitler called himself a techno-enthusiast (`Narr der\nTechnik'), Goebbels said programmatically that National Socialism `consciously\napproves' of technology and a publication of the SS called it a `weapon in the\n56 This is illustrated by my being able to use Walther Rathenau as an example of this change of\nattitude. See also Willeke (as footnote 31) and Mary Nolan, Visions of Modernity. American Business and\nthe Modernization of Germany (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994). A good example of the in\u00afuence\nof technocratic and authoritarian ideas on the popular imagination is Fritz Lang's \u00aelm Metropolis (1926).\n57 While Ju\u00c8nger promotes the idea of the new heroic man, he believes in neither superior or\ninferior races nor the achievement of his ideal through eugenic measures, but in changes of attitude.\n58 Pru\u00c8mm, Der soldatische Nationalismus, 393.\n59 Wulf Dieter Mu\u00c8ller, Ernst Ju\u00c8nger.

His political\nengagement with `soldierly nationalism' had ended in disappointment by the end of the 1920s. The\nmost one can try to show is that Ju\u00c8nger expressed a wider cultural mood of the time, which made\npeople susceptible to National Socialism.\n61 A good overview is Axel Schildt, `NS-Regime, Modernisierung und Moderne.

While it attacked the\nbanking system and the primacy of pro\u00aets in the capitalist system as an expression of\nallegedly Jewish materialism and greed, it praised the potential of modern\ntechnology and the deeds of entrepreneurs such as Krupp. The National Socialists,\nSchwerber claimed, accepted technology `consciously and happily' as the foundation\nof the nation, of a high standard of living and of military strength.65 With an equally\nstrong belief in the positive role of modern technology in changing society, Franz\nLawaczeck, one of the three founding fathers of the National Socialist engineers'\nassociation, Kampfbund Deutscher Architekten und Ingenieure, believed that the\nThird Reich could generate an abundance of cheap electricity that would promote\nsmall farms and businesses and promote a decentralisation of modern society.66\nIn its presentation to the public, National Socialism also stressed its positive\nattitude towards technology. With the slogan `Hitler above Germany', National\nSocialism drew attention to his use of an aeroplane. Hitler presented himself\n(wrongly) as the father of the motorway,67 opened car exhibitions and promoted\nthe idea of a cheap car for the mass of the people, not primarily for military or\neconomic purposes.68 He wanted to become a moderniser of German cities and had\na book of photographs published in which he presented himself alongside cars,\naeroplanes, ships and industrial sites.69 Also, the hope that a `Wunderwaffe' might\nmiraculously change the outcome of the war indicates a strong belief in the power\nof technology.\nThe National Socialist agricultural policy is an area which many historians have\n62 Adolf Hitler, Monologe im Fu\u00c8hrerhauptquartier 1941\u00b11944, ed.

While it is\ntrue that the importance they attached to land and a large rural population was\nsomewhat antiquated, one also has to remember that their policy was not directed\nagainst industry \u00b1 they merely wanted a different balance between the primary and\nthe secondary sector by strengthening the former.70 Even more to the point: they\ndid not want to maintain traditional farming methods, but promoted the use of\nmachines, tractors, fertilisers and electri\u00aecation. Their goal was to increase produc-\ntion to achieve a higher degree of self-suf\u00aeciency, and they were convinced that\nthey needed modern technology to achieve it.71\nIf one cannot speak about a rejection of technology in relation to National\nSocialist agricultural policy (where the ideology of `blood and soil' was most\nthoroughly applied), then obviously one can do so even less in relation to the\nindustrial and military sectors. Thus we can safely conclude that National Socialism\nfully accepted technology. Like large parts of the political right of the Weimar\nRepublic, the Nazis saw it as a necessary means for realising their vision of the\nfuture, especially their expansionist goals. Nevertheless there were important\ndifferences between visions such as the one Ju\u00c8nger had developed in `The Worker'\nand the Nazi attitude towards technology:\n1. While Ernst Ju\u00c8nger and other conservatives in the Weimar Republic had\neventually realised that systematic work in large technological systems is a necessary\nprerequisite for ef\u00aeciency under modern conditions (this was exactly their original\ncontribution to a conservative understanding of modern technology), National\nSocialism largely maintained the belief held by earlier or less advanced techno-\nenthusiasts that exceptionally gifted personalities with strong willpower could\novercome all the odds and turn technology into an obedient servant. It neither saw\nthe need to speak the `language' of technology and adapt to its imperatives, nor did\nit realise the dialectical connection between using technology and submitting to a\ntechnological lifestyle. In their conviction that technology would simply be a\nwonderful tool in their hands, National Socialists did not show any awareness of the\npower of technology over its users. Their naive optimism was immune to the\ndisenchanting experiences of the First World War and the ensuing economic crises,\nbecause they had the Jews, the communists and the Versailles Treaty to blame for all\nsuch negative developments.\n2. On a more practical level, Nazi policy never aimed for the consistency and all-\npervasive planning necessary to realise a technocratic state. One can \u00aend techno-\ncratic tendencies, but more characteristic, as historians such as Hans Mommsen and\nMartin Broszat have shown, are the many compromises with different social groups\nand large numbers of competing persons and institutions. Society was not supposed\nto function like a machine, but according to Darwinist social principles, according\nto which the strongest would prevail. This produced a `leadership chaos' which\n70 Hans-Erich Volkmann, `Die NS Wirtschaft in Vorbereitung des Krieges', in Milita\u00c8rgeschich-\ntliches Forschungsamt, ed., Das Deutsche Reich und der Zweite Weltkrieg, Vol. 1: Ursachen und\nVoraussetzungen der deutschen Kriegspolitik, (Stuttgart: DVA, 1979), 177\u00b1370, at 191.\n71 Volkmann, `Die NS Wirtschaft', 298\u00b1300, 217 f.\nAntimodernism, Reactionary Modernism and National Socialism 45\nclearly weakened the ef\u00aeciency of the Nazi system.72 Continuous improvisation\ninstead of long-term strategies, the lack of clear bureaucratic structures and areas of\nresponsibilities, the thwarting of long-term plans by the sudden decisions of leading\nNational Socialists, the short-term exploitation of resources, the lack of control of\nef\u00aeciency via a fully functional \u00aenancial system, the destruction of social relations\nand open exchange of information, all demonstrate a lack of understanding of the\nfunctioning of modern industry and technology.73 Hitler's reliance on the `creative\npower and ability of individual people' and his and Speer's order to the military\npersonnel to ask industry for new or better weapons, if they needed them,74 shows a\nlack of understanding of the need for coordinated and systematic research as well as\nof the logic of technical developments and innovations. A clear decline in patents\nand developments was the inevitable consequence.\n3. The National Socialist cultural policy was also marked by inconsistencies.\nWhile the modernists on the left and right demanded that all cultural forms should\nre\u00afect the functions of the technical age by abandoning all unnecessary decoration\n(`form follows function'), National Socialism corresponded with the popular taste,\nwhich more often than not did not want a correspondence between material\nreality and form, but an emotional compensation for the de\u00aecits of a functional\nmodernity. In contrast to Ju\u00c8nger's futurist demand for a functional logic and a\ntechnical style, which was to penetrate and determine all aspects of society and\nhuman existence, National Socialism rejected purist attempts to close the gap\nbetween technology and culture, favouring an undogmatic mix instead. In\nliterature, novels about exceptional engineers and technological achievements75\nco-existed with sentimental stories about rural life; for the national party meeting\nin 1934 (communicated to us mainly through the modern medium of \u00aelm, via the\nfamous Triumph of the Will) the historic city of Nuremberg was used as background\nfor Hitler's arrival in his aeroplane, for mass rallies and military parades with\nmodern armaments; the `beauty of work' programme promoted swimming pools,\ngrass and gardens, but also an increase in productivity; and the attempt to increase\nagricultural production was connected with an invention and promotion of\n72 Ian Kershaw, The Nazi Dictatorship.

This is particularly clear in Nazi architecture. It did not break completely\nwith the modern functional style, but used it primarily for commercial buildings, in\nroad construction and town planning. Of\u00aecial buildings were designed in the\nclassical or monumental style, and residential housing was ideally built in accordance\nwith a traditional regional style. While the industrial sphere was thus supposed to be\nfunctional and the political sphere awe-inspiring, the private sphere was aiming to\ngive a feeling of warmth and cosiness, even if one could only afford blocks of \u00afats\nconstructed out of standardised parts for the mass of the population.77\nNational Socialism did not share Ju\u00c8nger's concept of a `heroic realism' (which\nwas also not alien to other modernists with their celebration of an inhumane\ncoldness). It accepted that even people who want to be heroes have secret selves,\nwhose `tastes lie toward safety, soft beds, no work, pots of beer and women with\n``voluptuous'' \u00aegures.'78 They thus used heroic imagery on an ideological level, but\ntried to keep the sacri\u00aeces of their followers to a minimum. To avoid dissatisfaction\nand unrest, grain was imported to feed the population, although it slowed the\narmament programme, social policy was supposed to win popular support and\nentertainment dominated in radio and \u00aelm over boring propaganda. As Goebbels\nsaid about radio and cinema: `The [radio] programme . . . should present education,\nstimulation and entertainment in a clever mixture. Relaxation and entertainment\nhave to be considered foremost, because the large majority of listeners often lead a\nhard and relentless life . . . They have a right to \u00aend relaxation and recovery in their\nfew hours of leisure and quiet.'79 `The darker the streets are, the lighter our theatres\nand cinemas have to be . . . The harder the time is, the brighter must our art be to\nconsole the human soul.'80\nAs a consequence, between 60 and 70 per cent of radio programmes and more\n76 Peter Reichel, Der scho\u00c8ne Schein des Dritten Reiches.

Different opinions\ncould exist, because technology was not seen as a value or a force in itself. If one\naccepts that the creation of a pure `Aryan' race and German expansion were the two\nmain goals of National Socialism, then the attitude towards technology could vary\nand alter, because its value was determined by the question whether it threatened or\nhelped to achieve those goals. A few National Socialists were against technology,\nbecause they believed that it would undermine the strength of the `Aryan race', but\nmost were convinced that the National Socialist goals could only be achieved by\nmeans of a full embrace of modern technology. Like the group of those right-wing\nextremists in the Weimar Republic which Herf has named `reactionary modernists'\n(but also like many other conservatives), National Socialism accepted technology as\nan important tool in achieving their militaristic and racist goals.\nBut while the modernists on the right tried to face the fact that technology also\nplaces demands on its users and thereby alters them and society, National Socialism\ndrew on less sophisticated beliefs more typical of conservatives in imperial Germany.\nAs they had enough scapegoats to blame for all problems, they could uphold the\nbelief that technology would become an obedient servant, if only there was a\ndetermined political will. In holding previous political systems, their political\nopponents and the Jews responsible for unintended and unwanted aspects of the\ntechnical age, they did not acknowledge the full consequences of using modern\ntechnology and ignored the functional demands of large technical systems. This\nhelped them in gaining and maintaining political power, because they did not\nchallenge the existing order as fundamentally as somebody like Ju\u00c8nger and were\nmore open to pragmatic compromises.81 But they paid the price of a low economic\nef\u00aeciency.\nFor National Socialism, there was no reason to follow the modernists' attempt to\ncreate a culture re\u00afecting the industrial age with its stress on functionality and\nminimal means. Instead of developing a technological aesthetic, they stuck to the\nnineteenth-century notion that outside the sphere of production aesthetics meant\ndecoration, something applied to the surface of objects to hide their ugly reality.\nThe technical age was accepted as a practical necessity, but not celebrated in a\ntechnical style; people had to ful\u00ael their function, but relaxation and distraction\nwere granted; and culture was consciously employed as an escape from a dreary or\nhorrifying material reality. In this respect, the National Socialists arrived at a more\nsustainable lifestyle within modern reality than the modernists: in their openness to\ncompromise in all but their core beliefs they accepted that the demands of the\n81 Before Ju\u00c8nger became appalled by the crimes of National Socialism in power, his criticism of the\nparty in its movement phase had mainly been directed against their lack of uncompromising radicalness\n(Karlheinz Wei\u00fbmann, `Maurice Barre\u00c1s und der ``Nationalismus'' im Fru\u00c8hwerk Ernst Ju\u00c8ngers', in\nGu\u00c8nter Figal and Heimo Schwilk eds., Magie der Heiterkeit. Ernst Ju\u00c8nger zum Hundertsten (Stuttgart:\nKlett-Cotta, 1995), 141 f.).\n48 Contemporary European History\nmodern functional age were only bearable if allowance was made for compensation\nand escapism.82 National Socialism was popular and politically successful because it\nacknowledged and tolerated different forces and desires in human beings, thereby\navoiding purist extremes. Ironically, the Nazis' simplistic world-view (with their\ntrust in the positive potential of a pure Nordic race and their identi\u00aecation of\nscapegoats to explain away unintended and undesired developments) allowed them\nto absorb pragmatically a whole variety of impulses of the time and thereby integrate\ndifferent important social groups.\nHerf is right in arguing against earlier opinions that National Socialism cannot be\nunderstood as completely antimodern, because it made full use of technology. But\nhis attempt to identify one peculiar tradition of `reactionary modernism' which\nprepares the ground for National Socialism is not convincing. First of all, and most\nimportantly, he constructs and solves a problem that does not exist. It is simply not\nstrange or `paradoxical to reject the Enlightenment and embrace technology at the\nsame time',83 but common practice in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Germany\nas well as in many other countries. Instrumental reason and technology are available\nfor an endless number of different purposes, many of which are not humane or\nenlightened.84 Secondly, National Socialism does not have just one cultural root. It\nwas eclectic, drawing on many different traditions and reacting pragmatically to the\ncircumstances of the time. As its attitude towards technology was mainly pragmatic,\nit could take many different forms. The attempt to maintain power and achieve its\ncentral policy goals largely determined its usage of technology, not a preconceived\nworld view.\nIf my argument is right we are left with one last point: why is it so important to\nhistorians and their public to see National Socialism as not fully modern? Why was\nStern's book, The Politics of Cultural Despair so well received that the Times Literary\nSupplement regards it as one of the twenty-two most in\u00afuential books of the 1960s85\nand the term `reactionary modernism' has found wide acceptance? Without doubt it\nis of the highest importance to study the origins of a regime which committed\nunequalled crimes and to deal critically with all those aspects of German history\nwhich made its rise to power possible. But why this widespread refusal to accept\nthat National Socialism existed within the framework of modern societies and\nshowed speci\u00aecally modern features? Why associate romantic dreams like `nature\n82 It is true that some art consciously avoided functioning as compensation, because it aimed to\nmotivate people to make material reality more humane instead of just making it appear more humane.\nThis is a laudable attempt, but my conclusion still remains the same: as they did not succeed in changing\nmaterial reality, the compensatory model proved more successful.\n83 Herf, Reactionary Modernism, 3.\n84 By de\u00aenition instrumental reason is concerned with the means, not with the ends.

Why deny that the widespread acceptance of dangerous and inhumane\n(pseudo)-scienti\u00aec ideas such as racism, mad ideas like a Jewish world conspiracy\nand the desire for an authoritarian, non-pluralistic national community can result\nfrom a crisis of modernity?\nIf the dividing line between National Socialism and modernity is drawn\ncategorically, the critical scrutiny of German history can easily turn into an\napologia for modernity. One has to agree with Zygmunt Bauman that `the\ninterpretation of the Holocaust as a singular eruption of pre-modern (barbaric,\nirrational) forces, as yet insuf\u00aeciently tamed or ineffectually suppressed by\n(presumably weak or faulty) German modernization' can also ful\u00ael the function of\n`marginalising the crime and exonerating modernity'.88 Instead of calling Theodor\nW. Adorno and Max Horkheimer `strangely apologetic', as Herf does, because\nthey allegedly mistook a uniquely German phenomenon by interpreting it as the\ndarkest side of modernity,89 it is more convincing to argue that the stress on the\nnon-modern character of National Socialism can serve to pull the sting out of all\nthe Nazi crimes and belittle the dangerous aspects of modernity which Dialectic of\nEnlightenment tries to analyse.90 Instead of distancing modernity from National\nSocialism, we should learn to accept that it was by no means a necessary, but was a\npossible development within modernity. In that sense, National Socialism shows\nmodernity's most fatal potential.91\n86 Mosse, The Crisis of German Ideology, 2\n87 Stern, The Politics of Cultural Despair, Preface to 2nd ed.
