Paramedics in Britain\nnever use anaesthetic drugs or muscle relaxants to\nachieve intubation.\nAnecdotal experience shows that patients who can\nbe intubated without the use of drugs have a poor\nprognosis. We investigated mortality in a population of\ntrauma patients who were intubated before reaching\nhospital without anaesthetic drugs being used.\nParticipants, methods, and results\nWe looked retrospectively at the database of a helicop\u203a\nter emergency medical service staffed by doctors and\nparamedics that is specifically targeted at trauma\npatients in a mainly urban area. We identified patients\nwho had been intubated without drugs by paramedics\nor doctors, and we recorded whether they survived to\nhospital discharge. All patients were attended by physi\u203a\ncians, but many of the patients were intubated by\nground crew paramedics before the medical team\narrived. Patients were taken to the nearest appropriate\nhospital by ground or air.\nIn a six year period, from January 1990 to Decem\u203a\nber 1996, 1623 patients were intubated outside hospi\u203a\ntal. Of these, we excluded 143 (8.8%) because they were\nnot trauma patients. Of the remaining 1480 patients,\n492 (33.2%) were intubated without drugs: 275 (55.8%)\nby physicians and 216 (43.9%) by paramedics. Data\nregarding survival were not available for six of these\npatients, but of the remaining 486 patients, one (0.2%)\nsurvived. This person had a cardiac arrest after\npenetrating chest trauma and underwent a thora\u203a\ncotomy on scene to relieve pericardial tamponade and\nsuture the myocardium.\nComment\nAs almost all the trauma patients intubated without the\nuse of drugs died, the value of this practice is doubtful.\nTo allow easy passage of a tracheal tube without anaes\u203a\nthetic drugs, a patient must be profoundly uncon\u203a\nscious, and a high likelihood of death might be\nexpected. Despite this expectation, it was surprising\nthat the outcome was almost always fatal.\nParamedics in Britain have been intubating without\nthe use of anaesthetic drugs for more than 20 years,\nand many resources have been invested in teaching the\nskill. This intervention was introduced mainly to\nimprove outcome following medical (non\u203atraumatic)\ncardiac arrest, but recently the effectiveness of\nintubation in this situation has been questioned.1 In\npatients with severe trauma, airway compromise is a\ncause of prehospital death that can be prevented2 and\nsimple airway manoeuvres can clear the airway to pro\u203a\nvide vital oxygenation.\nLaryngoscopy and attempted intubation without\ndrugs have potential risks, such as an increase in\nintracranial pressure, vomiting, and unrecognised\noesophageal intubation.3 Some trauma systems use\ndrugs to facilitate prehospital intubation\u2014this is stand\u203a\nard practice for paramedics and nurses in parts of the\nUnited States\u2014but even if drugs are used, failed\nintubation rates can be high.4\nThere is little evidence about the optimum prehos\u203a\npital management of severe blunt injury, and there are\nno controlled trials of the different methods of airway\nmanagement. As the role of the UK paramedic is\nunder discussion5 and there are few data from the\nUnited Kingdom about the rate of failed prehospital\nintubation in trauma patients, the use of non\u203adrug\nassisted intubation deserves further scrutiny.\nContributors: DL, GD, and TC conceived the idea for the study.\nDL collected the data and wrote the paper.

The ABC illustrations\nshowed the diaphragm of the stethoscope being\nused, whereas McAlister and Straus, in their evidence\nbased review of blood pressure measurement, said\nthat the bell should be used (see \u201cGuidelines\u201d box in\ntheir article). The readers wondered which is the\ncorrect method (bell or diaphragm). It may come\ndown to differences in practice between North\nAmerica and the United Kingdom. O\u2019Brien and\ncolleagues told us that the British Hypertension\nSociety\u2019s recommendations on blood pressure\nmeasurement advocate using the diaphragm rather\nthan the bell, as no evidence exists to support using\nthe bell in modern stethoscopes. McAlister and\nStraus said that evidence shows minimal or no\ndifference between the bell and the diaphragm and\nthat their article followed the guidelines of the\nAmerican Society of Hypertension and the\nAmerican Heart Association.
