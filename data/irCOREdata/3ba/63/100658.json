The formation\nof this material by self-assembly alleviates the need for ex-\npensive lithography. However, the temperature at which it is\nnormally synthesized restricts its application to certain areas,\nsuch as deployment on flexible substrates, or its compatibil-\nity with subsequent processes \u0001e.g., unavoidable drive-in dif-\nfusion of dopants when the intended application is as inter-\nconnects in silicon hybrid devices\u0002.\nRecently, there have been reports of low-temperature\nsynthesis of carbon nanotubes.8,9 However, low-temperature\nsynthesis typically results in amorphous carbon or carbon\nnanofibers, rather than nanotubes. The formation of carbon\nnanotubes is typically carried out at temperatures above\n900 \u00b0C. In the conventional growth mechanism however, the\nrole of the substrate plays no part, other than as support. This\nmeans that there is only a requirement for the catalyst to be\nsufficiently heated and not the substrate. A simple way of\nachieving this is to use a layer with lower thermal conduc-\ntivity to restrict the transfer of heat to the substrate. It is\nshown in this letter that a combination of a titanium layer\nand reduced hydrocarbon concentration can be used to\nachieve nanotube growth at low substrate temperatures, us-\ning plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition \u0001CVD\u0002.\nA parallel-plate direct current-PECVD system is used in\nthe growth, with acetylene as the carbon feedstock and nitro-\ngen and hydrogen as the carrier\/dilution gas. The system\nbase pressure is 10\u22123 Torr and the graphite substrate table\ntemperature is monitored using an embedded thermocouple.\nThe temperature reading is taken as the highest temperature\nreached during deposition. The concentration of hydrocarbon\nwas simply taken as the gas flow ratio of acetylene to a\nnitrogen and hydrogen mixture.

A typical run would start with the backfilling\nof the evacuated chamber to the desired operating pressure\nwith the nitrogen and hydrogen mixture, and then igniting\nthe plasma before the introduction of acetylene. The deposi-\ntion was carried out for 45 min. After deposition, the sample\nwas allowed to cool to below 50 \u00b0C in a nitrogen ambient,\nbefore sample removal. The empirical observation of the\nmorphology and microstructure of the nanotubes were con-\nducted using a Hitachi S-4000 field emission scanning elec-\ntron microscope \u0001SEM\u0002 and Philips CM200 high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscope \u0001HRTEM\u0002. The HRTEM is\noperated at 200 kV with a LaB6 filament and has a line reso-\nlution of 0.14 nm.\nThe low thermal conductivity of titanium \u0001among the\nmetals\u0002 means it can be utilised as an effective thermal bar-\nrier. A simple thermodynamic simulation shows that, at\nsteady state, large thermal gradients can be achieved using\nincreasing layer thicknesses \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004. The structure simu-\nlated is based on a double layer consisting of 10 nm nickel\non different thicknesses of titanium, on a 1000 nm silicon\nsubstrate \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004. In order to simulate the concept of sur-\nface plasma heating and the thermal barrier, the surface is\nkept at 550 \u00b0C while the base of the substrate is kept at\n27 \u00b0C. The important point here is that the titanium layer can\nbe used to hold significant plasma heating on the surface\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject towhile allowing the substrate to be maintained at a much\nlower temperature, purely due to its lower thermal\nconductivity.\nCarbon nanotubes were synthesized with the plasma ig-\nnited at \u2212500 V bias at 10.3 Torr. The growth was carried\nout for 45 min. The effect of varying the hydrocarbon con-\ncentration on the growth is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe maximum temperature reached was 392 \u00b0C, with\nthe lowest temperature only reaching 371 \u00b0C \u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004. The\ntemperature stabilized within 10 min, suggesting that equi-\nlibrium had been reached. In a typical CVD process without\nany deliberate modifications, nanotube growth would not be\nobserved at these temperatures. For all hydrocarbon varia-\ntions, nanotube growth has been observed, with the quantity\nof amorphous carbon increasing as the hydrocarbon concen-\ntration increases. With 1% hydrocarbon concentration, the\nsynthesized nanotubes appear as tightly packed vertically\naligned bundles. Once the concentration is increased, the\ngrowth resembles clumps of amorphous carbon, with de-\ncreasing nanotube yield. Upon reaching 6%, the film begins\nto form into amorphous carbon thin films. It is important to\nnote that, without the titanium layer, no growth was observed\nat such low temperatures. There were no observable changes\nin the diameters of the synthesized carbon nanotubes, as the\nFIG. 2.

This is\nunusual, since the diameters of the nanotubes are typically\ndependent on the thickness of the catalyst films, i.e., nano-\ntube diameters are either similar or larger than the films\u2019\nthickness.10 This frequently observed trend is due to the\nnanotube nucleating from the catalyst nanoparticles. The\nmorphology of the carbon nanotubes is analyzed using HR-\nTEM, as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe sample was obtained by scratching the surface with\ntweezers and subsequent ultrasonication in methanol. The\nsolution was then filtered through a holey carbon grid. The\ninner core of the nanotube can be clearly seen, with the\ngraphene planes oriented parallel to the nanotube axis. This\ntechnique, of using the barrier layer and plasma heating, is\ndemonstrated to be able to synthesize carbon nanotubes.\nConventional lower temperature processes typically yield\ncarbon nanofibers.8,9,11 The approach of surface heating and\nsubstrate cooling will allow for the synthesis of the carbon\nnanotubes at low substrate temperatures. It is also possible\nthat graphitization can be improved, with increased surface\nheating.\nThe technique shown here utilises both the low thermal\nconductivity of titanium and the low concentration of hydro-\ncarbon. In plasma-assisted growth, the surface heating from\nthe plasma is often ignored, or assumed to be similar to the\nset substrate temperature. The significance of plasma heating\n12\nFIG. 3. HRTEM of low-temperature synthesized carbon nanotube with inner\ndiameter of 1.6 nm and outer diameter of 7 nm.has been highlighted by Teo et al., where it was reported\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tothat plasma heating using 200 W can result in the substrate\nheating up to 700 \u00b0C. However, this is a general statement\nwhich we do not apply to many growth chambers, as the\nheating depends on the plasma power density \u000120 W cm2 in\nRef. 12\u0002. For our experiment, the power density was only\n5.37 W cm2, which is only about one-quarter of the power\nshown to result in a substrate heating of 700 \u00b0C. The tita-\nnium layer not only allows significant heat to be held close to\nthe surface, it also provides a conductive layer below the\nnanotubes. With suitable cooling, this would ensure that the\nsubstrate is kept at low temperatures, considerably below\n700 \u00b0C. The flux of carbon arriving at the catalyst surface\nplays a crucial role. Growth at low substrate temperatures\ndoes not allow for rapid diffusion and for the interaction of\ncarbon in\/with the nickel catalyst. Therefore, if a typical hy-\ndrocarbon concentration of 5% or greater is used, this rapidly\nleads to thin-filmlike formation which inhibits the nucleation\nand formation of nanostructures.\nIn conclusion, carbon nanotubes can be synthesized at\nrelatively low substrate temperatures, using a combination of\na titanium barrier layer and low hydrocarbon concentrations,\nin a plasma-assisted growth technique. The use of titanium as\na thermal barrier will allow the possibility of maintaining the\nsubstrate temperature close to room temperature, while al-\nlowing the growth of carbon nanotubes with high levels of\ngraphitization.\n1C.
