Introduction\n[2] The Proterozoic Mozambique orogenic belt (MOB) is\npart of the East African orogen [Stern, 1994] and exposes\nsteep high-grade middle to lower crust widely believed to\nrecord the Neoproterozoic closure of an ocean basin which\nsutured east and west Gondwana [Shackleton, 1986, 1993,\n1996; Stern, 1994]. Many linear Precambrian sutures and\/or\nophiolite belts are suggested to run N\u2013S and NW\u2013SE for\nseveral hundreds of kilometers from northeast Africa into\nthe northern part of the MOB [Berhe, 1990] where they\ndisappear under younger cover rocks (Figure 1). In southern\nKenya and northern Tanzania (Figure 1), the MOB is\nbordered to the west by the Archaean Tanzania craton (West\nGondwana). This region is also the locus of Cenozoic rifting\nand magmatism [e.g., Bosworth, 1987; Smith, 1994] such\nthat much of the Precambrian terrain is covered by volcanic\nmaterials (Figure 1). Recent geophysical investigations have\nfocused on understanding the lithospheric-scale structural\ncontrols on the rifting and magmatism [e.g., Birt et al.,\n1997; Byrne et al., 1997; Tesha et al.,1997; Simpson, 2000]\nand the extent of magmatic modification of the upper crust\n[Simiyu and Keller, 2001]. The precise relationship between\nthe MOB and the Tanzania craton in this region is still not\nwell understood and is central to our understanding of\nPrecambrian tectonism [Shackleton, 1986, 1993, 1996;\nMaboko, 2000] and the link between Precambrian basement\nheterogeneity and Cenozoic rifting and magmatism in\nKenya [e.g., Bosworth, 1987; Mosley, 1993; Smith and\nMosley, 1993; Birt et al., 1997]. Along the Kenya-Tanzania\nborder (Figure 1), the craton exposes Archaean granitoid\ngneisses and metavolcanics while the MOB exposes mainly\nhighly fractured quartzites and gneisses [Simiyu and Keller,\n2001]. A 100-km-wide complex zone of ductile and brittle\nshears and thrust faults, bounded in the south by the Aswa-\nNandi-Loita (ANL) shear zone and in the northeast by the\nSekerr-Athi-Ikutha shear zone (Figure 1), is believed to\nplace bounds on the respective craton and MOB margins\n[e.g., Smith and Mosley, 1993] but its deep structure is\nunknown and the Archaean basement-cover relation in the\nregion has remained a subject of long-standing debate.\n[3] Shackleton [1986] proposed an E-dipping suture zone\nat the western margin of the MOB in Kenya, exemplified by\nan outcropping 450 dipping zone of mylonitized Archaean\nrocks in thrust contact with Proterozoic metasediments and\nophiolitic slivers to the east at Sekerr in northwestern Kenya\n(Figure 1). The suture zone is suggested to coincide with the\nOloololo escarpment (Figure 1) in southwest Kenya\n[Shackleton, 1986; Tesha et al., 1997] and is supported by\ngravity studies near the Equator [e.g., Nyblade and Pollack,\n1992; Simiyu and Keller, 1997]. However, some workers\n[Smith, 1994; Birt et al., 1997] argue that the suture zone in\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, B04103, doi:10.1029\/2005JB004028, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Environmental Science, Lancaster University, Lancaster,\nUK.\n2Department of Geophysics, National and Kapodistrian University of\nAthens, Athens, Greece.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2005JB004028$09.00\nB04103 1 of 19\nsouthern Kenya lies directly under the rift axis (and influ-\nenced rift evolution). Central to this argument is an area\nbetween Oloololo and Magadi (Loita Hills in Figure 1)\nwhere Archaean crust is believed to be buried under\ngravitationally collapsed nappes and imbricated thrust slices\nof MOB rocks [Mosley, 1993; Smith and Mosley, 1993].\nMoller et al. [1998] predict that a narrow zone of mixing of\nArchaean and Proterozoic crust extends from Tanzania to\nthe Sekerr area and runs close to the craton in Kenya.\n[4] Combined gravity and seismic refraction studies\n(KRISP94 Project) in southern Kenya [Birt et al., 1997]\nsuggest an essentially layered crustal structure across the\nregion with the Moho depth varying from about 33 km in\nthe Archaean craton to 40 km beneath the MOB east of the\nrift valley and did not show any sign of a suture at Oloololo\nor crustal thrust zones (duplex-structures) in the Loita area.\nBirt et al. [1997] suggested that a low-density and low-\nvelocity zone imaged in the upper mantle beneath the rift\naxis can be explained by the presence of up to 6% partial\nmelt. The model of Birt et al. [1997] was used with wide-\nangle seismic reflection data to infer the existence of two\ndiscontinuous upper mantle reflectors (at depths varying\nbetween 43 and 63 km) extending beneath both flanks of the\nrift from the Oloololo Escarpment, and ascribed to mag-\nmatic underplating [Byrne et al., 1997, Figure 6]. Simpson\n[2000] suggests that long-period magnetotelluric (LMT)\nand magnetovariational (MV) data do not support the\nexistence of partial melt in the upper mantle beneath the\nrift. On the basis of simple three-dimensional (3-D) forward\nmodeling of limited MV and LMT data from stations MIG,\nOLO, KEK, LEG, MOR, IRK, NGU, MAG, SIN, and LUK\nin Figure 1, Simpson [2000] proposes the following: (1) The\nupper mantle is conductive to the west and resistive to the\neast of the western rift margin. (2) A crust of 1000 Wm\nresistivity exists across the whole region. It is 80 km thick in\nthe exposed Archaean craton west of the Oloololo Escarp-\nment and 40 km thick elsewhere. N\u2013S trending, 3\u20135 km\nthick, conductive double half-grabens represent the Kenya\nRift Valley, and two NW\u2013SE-trending elongate conductive\nsheets (taken to represent 3-D middle\/lower crustal linea-\nments) extend beneath both flanks of the rift from the\nOloololo Escarpment. However, it is unclear whether the\npredicted deep crustal lineaments and upper mantle divide\nactually relate to the outcropping NW\u2013SE trending shear\nzones and Quaternary volcanoes in the region (see inset map\nin Figure 1) [Bosworth, 1987; Smith, 1994; Macdonald,\n2003] previously suggested to influence long period MV\ndata [e.g., Banks and Beamish, 1979].\nFigure 1.

Simiyu and Keller [2001] also suggest that\nthe low velocities and densities observed under the western\nflank of the rift probably represent reworked Archaean\nTanzania craton. Thus the outstanding questions that have\nimportant tectonic implications in the region are (1) What\nare the precise extents of, and structural relationship\nbetween, the Archaean Tanzania craton and the MOB in\nsouthwestern Kenya? Is there a buried Archaean crust in\nthe Loita area [Mosley, 1993]? (2) Is there an E-dipping\nsuture zone near the Oloololo Escarpment [Shackleton,\n1986; Simiyu and Keller, 2001]? (3) How deep-rooted are\nthe suggested Aswa-Nandi-Loita and Athi-Ikutha NW\u2013SE\nlineaments seen on the surface? Do they extend vertically\ninto the upper mantle or become listric and sole into a\ndetachment surface possibly in the lower crust? Is there a\nlink between basement heterogeneity and surface deforma-\ntion or magmatism? (4) Is there partial melt in the mantle\ndirectly below the rift or a substantial disruption of the sub-\nMoho lithosphere in southern Kenya [Birt et al., 1997;\nSakkas, 1999; Simpson, 2000]? We believe that answers to\nthese fundamental questions will enable us understand\nbetter any possible relationship between basement structure\nand Phanerozoic tectonism in the region [cf. Smith and\nMosley, 1993; Birt et al., 1997]. Also, any acceptable\nanswers must be consistent with all the available geological\nand geophysical observations in the region.\n[6] Two-dimensional (2-D) conductivity imaging of wide-\nbandwidth magnetotelluric (MT) data is successfully being\nused worldwide to study the regional structure and the\ndistribution of fluids in steep fault-zones and orogenic belts\n[e.g.,Chen et al., 1996; Ledo and Jones, 2000; Bai andMeju,\n2003; Unsworth et al., 2004; Soyer and Unsworth, 2006].\nSince the MOB of southern Kenya and northern Tanzania\nexposes steep middle to lower crust and large-scale shear\nzones [Shackleton, 1986, 1993; Smith, 1994; Moller et al.,\n1998; Maboko, 2000], MT data imaging is appropriate for\naddressing the geological questions highlighted above. How-\never, Simpson [2000] opines that there is no predominant or\naverage regional geoelectrical strike direction across south-\nern Kenya and that 2-D data imaging is therefore untenable.\nThe available short-period MT data, shown elsewhere to be\nconsistent with long-period data [Simpson et al., 1997], were\nalso deemed not to be of useable quality thus limiting the\nanalysis to a subset [Simpson, 2000, Table 1] of the available\nMT data [Sakkas, 1999]. The NW\u2013SE trending middle to\nlower crust lineaments that are central in Simpson\u2019s 3-D\nanalysis are based on the suggested [Smith andMosley, 1993]\n100-km-wide zone of ductile shearing and thrusting that\noutcrops in the Athi area (Figure 1) and which should\ntherefore provide some ground-truth for any workable model\nof the subsurface.\n[7] There is no sign, in the upper crust of Simpson\u2019s\nresistivity model, of the prominent NW\u2013SE basement\nstructures seen on satellite imagery and identified on the\nsurface [Smith and Mosley, 1993]. Given that where they cut\nthe rift at the Equator, these NW\u2013SE structures bound\nstructural highs with depth to crystalline basement of\n<2 km [Smith and Mosley, 1993], is it possible that they\nare shallow-depth features? The KRISP94 line G seismic\nand gravity models [Birt et al., 1997] suggest only minor\nmodification of the shallow crust in the vicinity of the\noutcropping ductile shear zone near station CHN (feature\nlabeled LDS in Figure 1). It will be instructive to examine\nthe audiofrequency magnetotelluric (AMT) data along this\nparticular seismic-gravity profile to ascertain any possible\nshallow-depth signature of the LDS and ANL shear zones\nand their relationship with the deep basement. A recent\ncombined geological, geochemical and isotopic study iden-\ntified a Neoproterozoic magmatic arc (see MMA in Figure 1)\nnear the Athi-Ikutha shear zone [Nyamai et al., 1999, 2003]\nraising the possibility of a concealed fossil subduction zone\nor hitherto unknown deep features in the region that can be\nimaged using the available LMT data. We posit that the\nreactivation of both shallow and deep systems of Precam-\nbrian shear zones and thrusts under varying stress condi-\ntions (possibly induced by lithospheric buckling) and their\npossible subsequent modification by fluids from the wide-\nspread Quaternary magmatism in this region should render\nthem detectable by broadband MT conductivity imaging.\nThere are therefore good grounds for re-analyzing all the\navailable MT data, including our short period measurements\n[Sakkas, 1999], for the KRISP94 project with no a priori\ngeological or geophysical assumptions and evaluating the\nresult using independent information provided by other\ncollocated geophysical measurements. This is the main\nthrust of the present paper and should enable us to better\nunderstand the resistivity structure of the region and its\nrelevance to the on-going debate on craton-cover relations\nin southern Kenya and northern Tanzania.\n2. Reanalysis of Broadband MT Data From\nSouthern Kenya\n[8] Collocated central- and single-loop transient electro-\nmagnetic (TEM) and wide-bandwidth (10\u00013 to 104 s) MT\ndata were recorded at stations spaced 10\u201320 km apart in\nsouthern Kenya close to the Kenya-Tanzania border (Figure 1)\nusing two different field systems developed at Edinburgh\nand Gottingen Universities [Simpson et al., 1997; Sakkas,\n1999]. Although the first-order Proterozoic structures in\nKenya trend NNW\u2013SSE and N\u2013S [Smith and Mosley,\n1993], the survey orientation was dictated by accessibility\nand the seismic-gravity component of the integrated\nKRISP94 experiments [cf. Birt et al., 1997; Simpson et\nal., 1997]. The main 400 km long WNW\u2013ESE MT survey\nline (KRISP94 Line G) consists of stations NYA to CHN in\nFigure 1 and runs from the Archaean Tanzania craton to the\nQuaternary volcanic field of Chyulu Hills, cutting across the\nOloololo Escarpment, the Loita Hills, Nguruman Escarp-\nment, and the Kenya Rift Valley. The shorter LUK-MWA\nline (KRISP94 Line F) lies directly over a suggested\nlineament (herein conveniently called the Lukenya ductile\nshear zone, LDS in Figure 1). An L-shaped telluric config-\nuration was used in our MT setup and formed the two\ncorners of the 100 m-sided TEM transmitter loop, thus\nensuring that both methods sampled the same geology. For\neach site, the AMT data were recorded in a day while LMT\nrecordings were made over 10\u201314 days. The stations were\nmostly located on Cenozoic volcanic rocks with a few on\nPrecambrian basement and alluvial outcrops (see Figure 1\nB04103 MEJU AND SAKKAS: MT IMAGING OF SOUTHERN KENYA\n3 of 19\nB04103\nand Table 1). One station located between SIN and SEL at\nthe eastern rift flank was abandoned due to strong noise\ncontamination of the MT records in that locality (Kajiado)\nand this severely affected our sampling density. The result\nfor the LUK-MWA stations have been presented by Sakkas\net al. [2002]. We are interested here in the NYA-CHN line.\nA subset of the long-period data for this line was used by\nSimpson [2000]. We will emphasize the short period data\nnecessary for imaging the upper crustal structure across the\npoorly understood Loita area [Mosley, 1993; Smith, 1994]\nand the belt of exposed NW\u2013SE shears at the eastern end of\nthe transect. Note there is a 25 km offset between the\nstarting points of the KRISP94 seismic and MT profiles\nreferred to in this paper (our station NYA is at seismic\nposition 25 km).\n2.1. Regional Strike Determination and Near-Surface\nStatic-Shift Correction With Multigeometry TEM Data\n[9] All the KRISP94 MT field data [Simpson et al., 1997;\nSakkas, 1999] were reprocessed using tensorial analysis\nmethods [Groom and Bailey, 1989; Bahr, 1991] and the\nresult examined for dimensionality characteristics and static-\nshifts caused by near-surface heterogeneities. The result\nof initial analysis using the distortion classification method\nof Bahr [1991] is summarized in Table 1. It would appear\nfrom this table that the data for many sites show character-\nistics of weak local distortion (class 3) or fall into class 1 in\nthe high frequency bands such that the tensor can be\ndescribed using the conventional method. However, the\ndata for a number of sites, particularly at the 4\u201332 s period\nband, appear to fall into class 7 with skew values greater\nthan 0.3 suggesting a regional 3-D anomaly for which the\nsuperimposition model is not appropriate. Nevertheless, if\nthe decomposition method yields a consistent regional strike\nfor neighbouring stations, then the regional structure can be\nconsidered to be approximately 2-D [Groom and Bailey,\n1989; Bahr, 1991]. It is significant that a detailed site-by-\nsite examination of the distortion classes (Table 1) in\nrelation to the quality of the unrotated apparent resistivity\nand phase data [see Simpson, 2000, Figure 2] revealed a\nstrong correlation between those period bands that fall into\nclass 7 and the noisiest MT (particularly phase) record\nsegments. The same correlation also exists for our rotated\ndata (shown later in Figure 3).\n[10] The AMT induction arrows are of relatively poor\nquality when compared to long period data as also noted by\nSimpson [2000] and examples are shown in Figure 2a.\nHowever, three first-order observations can be drawn from\nFigure 2a. First, at high frequencies (>0.04 Hz), conductive\nboundaries are suggested between stations NYA and MIG\n(feature labeled F), near OLO (feature C), and at the western\nand eastern rift margins (features D and A, respectively).\nFeature C appears to be related to the surface-mapped\ncraton-cover contact (CCC in Figure 2a) at high frequen-\ncies. The commonly assumed continental-scale lineaments\n(ANL and Athi-Ikutha shear zones) do not appear to\ninfluence the induction arrows at these frequencies. The\nLDS or another coincident but hitherto unknown feature\nappears to influence the induction arrows of the LUK-MWA\nstations at high frequencies. Second, at midfrequencies of\nabout 0.04\u20130.014 Hz, the induction arrows suggest that\nfeature C possibly exerts a major influence on the NYA-\nCHN line. It would appear that the ANL and Athi-Ikutha\nshear zones do not have a substantial influence on the NYA-\nCHN data while the LDS or another coincident regional\nconductor appears to influence the LUK-MWA sites at\nmidfrequencies. Third, at low frequencies (<0.014 Hz),\nneither the ANL-LDS nor the Athi-Ikutha shear systems\nsatisfactorily explain all the observed variations in ampli-\ntude and direction of the induction arrows. Rather, two deep\nconductive axes correlating with those suggested by Banks\nand Beamish [1979] and the trace of the Quaternary\nvolcanoes appear to be regionally important.

The azimuths\nfor stations NYA to SEL on the main line show a domi-\nnant N23\u0001\u201335\u0001W (or N55\u0001\u201367\u0001E) trend especially at\nfrequencies lower than 0.025 Hz. We take the NW\u2013SE\ndirection as the regional geoelectrical strike for the NYA-\nSEL segment since it agrees with the well-documented geo-\nlogical basement trend in the region [Shackleton, 1986;\nBerhe, 1990; Smith and Mosley, 1993] and the induction\nvectors (Figure 2a). The NE\u2013SW azimuths computed for\nthe LUK-MWA stations possibly suggest a high contrast\nboundary or a fundamental change in basement character at\nthe eastern margin of the Kenya Rift; these stations lie close\nto outcropping NW\u2013SE shear zones and a NW\u2013SE trend-\ning low-velocity zone [Ritter and Kasper, 1997]. We found\nthat mathematically rotating the impedance data for these\nstations by 90 degrees leads to strike angles that are\nconsistent with those of the NYA-SEL segment. This is\nconsistent with the natural behaviour of MT fields in the\nvicinity of a 2-D contact. There is therefore a consistent\nregional geoelectrical strike from these measurements but\nour WNW\u2013ESE survey line runs somewhat oblique to it. It\nis noteworthy that 3-D teleseismic tomography clearly\nshows NW\u2013SE-trending zones of anomalous velocity at\n5\u201390 km depth in the Chyulu Hills area [Ritter and Kasper,\n1997]. Also, nearer the Equator, Rooney and Hutton [1977]\nshow a consistent electrical strike direction of N18\u0001Walong\na WSW\u2013ENE MT line across the rift (Figure 2b). A similar\ntrend (see Figure 2a) is indicated by past long period MV\nstudies in the region [Beamish, 1977; Banks and Beamish,\n1979]. We noted that the unrotated data for stations IRK and\nLEG show phase splitting at high frequencies which possi-\nbly can be explained by the presence of 3-D elongate\noverburden sources [cf. Sasaki and Meju, 2006, Figure 5]\nbut this will be difficult to constrain using the data from the\nwidely spaced regional soundings. We consider that there\nare sufficient indications, from the above data analyses, that\nan approximate 2-D data imaging is valid for the NYA-\nCHN transect. The required transverse magnetic (TM) and\ntransverse electric (TE) mode data for 2-D inversion were\nFigure 2a.

We recognize\nthat this surface-consistent static-shift correction approach\n(weathering correction, sensu stricto) may not account for\nstatic-shift arising from deeper small-size 3-D heterogene-\nities [e.g., Bahr et al., 2000]. However, it helps reduce the\nuncertainty in regional MT data interpretation and it has\nbeen demonstrated at several borehole sites that this ap-\nproach leads to improved accuracy in depth mapping of\ngeological formations [e.g., Sternberg et al., 1988; Meju,\n1996; Meju et al., 1999]. Note that the sounding curve\nsegments in Figure 3 that correspond to the 4\u201332 s period\nband falling into Bahr\u2019s [1991] class 7 are characterized by\npoor signal levels (cf. OLO, NGU, and SIN in Table 1)\nwhile for other short-period bands it correlates to a frequency-\ndependent noisy segment (see the 2\u20135 Hz noise con-\ntamination at MAG in Figure 3). Such data segments will\ntherefore be removed or down-weighted in our adopted 2-D\ninversion approach thus effectively removing the need for\nmodelling what could be an unnecessary level of complex-\nity in our data.\n2.2. Qualitative Consistency Analysis of AMT and\nLMT Response Patterns\n[13] As a qualitative check of the static-shift-corrected\nMT apparent resistivities across the Oloololo Escarpment\nand the Rift Valley, we show the adopted TE and TM mode\ndata for selected short periods (32, 8, 0.5, 0.04 Hz) and long\nperiods (500 and 1000 s) in Figure 4. The short period data\nare remarkably similar for both modes possibly suggesting\nrelatively simple shallow crustal structures. There are no\nLMT data for station LOL west of OLO. Also, the TM\nmode LMT data at station SEL are of poor quality. Never-\ntheless, note the consistency in the pattern of variation of\nboth the AMT and LMT apparent resistivities with distance.\nWe therefore consider the AMT data to be of useable\nquality. Both the AMT and LMT data suggest strong lateral\nFigure 2b. Map showing the unconstrained Groom and Bailey [1989] azimuths of the MT impedance\ntensor at representative short and long periods sampling different depths. The data suggest a strong NW\u2013\nSE basement structural trend from west to east along the NYA-CHN line. The thick solid line labeled\nR&H1977 shows the MT profile of Rooney and Hutton [1977]. The box labeled R&K1997 in Figures 2a\nand 2b shows the area where NW\u2013SE trending lithospheric zones of alternating low and high velocities\nwere imaged by three-dimensional (3-D) teleseismic tomography [Ritter and Kasper, 1997].\nB04103 MEJU AND SAKKAS: MT IMAGING OF SOUTHERN KENYA\n6 of 19\nB04103\nchanges at positions 70\u201390 km (spatially correlating with\nthe OLO area) and near positions 200 and 250 km (spatially\ncorrelating with the western and eastern rift margins) as\nwould be expected from theory for steep conductive con-\ntacts. The zone of high resistivity west of OLO coincides\nwith an Archaean greenstone belt, that found between OLO\nand position 200 km correlates spatially with the Mara\nPlains and Loita Hills area where Archaean crust is thought\nto be deeply buried [Mosley, 1993], while that east of the\nmain rift correlates with the Mozambique belt. There is thus\ngood correlation between the apparent resistivity response\nand the known principal physiographic units on the NYA-\nCHN transect. This is taken as providing further support for\nthe adopted 2-D data imaging approach described below.\nExploring further the data selected for 2-D imaging, the\nimpedance phases (shown later in Figure 6) at the eastern\nend of the profile (stations SEL and CHN) are less than 45\u0001\nat the longest periods and the apparent resistivities rise in\nvalue suggesting that the crust or upper mantle at some\ndepth there should be relatively resistive. Inside and west of\nthe rift, the phases are consistently greater than 45\u0001 at\nperiods longer than 100 s and suggest that a major basal\nconductor exists here at some depth.\n3. Two-Dimensional Resistivity Imaging and\nModel Appraisal\n3.1. Two-Dimensional Smooth Minimum-Structure\nVersus Structured Blocky Imaging\n[14] An important consideration in this study is the fact\nthat the exposed Precambrian basement in our study area is\ndominated by steep geological structures [Shackleton, 1986;\nSmith and Mosley, 1993]. It is well known that the\nTM mode data alone will not image narrow steep conductors\nFigure 3. Illustration of MT data quality variations and method of dual-mode static-shift correction\nusing multigeometry TEM data. For each station, the apparent resistivity data (shown with error bars\nrepresenting 1 standard deviation) for the TE mode (left) and TM mode (right) are corrected using data\nfrom different TEM loop configurations that respond differently to lateral resistivity changes in the near-\nsurface [e.g., Sakkas et al., 2002]. Note the band-limited noisy segments of these frequency sounding\ncurves (cf. Table 1).\nB04103 MEJU AND SAKKAS: MT IMAGING OF SOUTHERN KENYA\n7 of 19\nB04103\nFigure 4\nB04103 MEJU AND SAKKAS: MT IMAGING OF SOUTHERN KENYA\n8 of 19\nB04103\nand may overestimate the amount of conductive targets in\nthe subsurface while the TE mode data, although more\nsensitive to narrow steep conductors and to the depth of\nburied conductive targets [e.g., Wannamaker et al., 1984;\nAgarwal et al., 1993], will be insufficient for characterizing\nthe subsurface in 2-D. We therefore opted for joint imaging\nof the TE and TM mode apparent resistivity and phase data\nand especially since the short period data for both modes\nappear to be comparable (see Figure 4). The vertical\nmagnetic field data (Figure 2a) were not considered for\njoint inversion with these MT responses since the induction\narrows have relatively large errors at many sites especially\nat short periods [Sakkas, 1999]. An effective way of\ninterpreting a sparse set of MT data is to seek the minimum\nnumber of parameters that can explain the data [Constable\net al., 1987]. We therefore experimented with reconstructing\nsmooth models and follow-up structured (blocky) models to\ntest how well our field data constrain the resistivity results.\nWe used a regularized conjugate gradients inversion scheme\nfor the minimum-structure imaging and a Gauss-Newton\nalgorithm [Mackie et al., 1997; Rodi and Mackie, 2001] for\nblock-model imaging. Both algorithms allow the incorpo-\nration of surface topography, which we determined using\ndifferential GPS measurements (furnished by Birt et al.\n[1997]) and digital elevation models.\n[15] In the minimum-structure inversion experiments, the\nemphasis was on reducing model-driven bias in the image\nreconstruction by using several half-space initial models of\ndifferent resistivities (including 1000 Wm used as back-\nground resistivity in the work of Simpson [2000]) and\nseeking the smoothest models that match our data. The\naverage apparent resistivity for the data to be inverted\nwas 794 Wm for the AMT and 257 Wm for the LMT data\nset (but 100 Wm and 60 Wm for IRK-CHN in the rift valley\nsubregion). We therefore selected initial models of 50, 100,\n200, 350, 500, and 1000 Wm for our investigation and only\nthose reconstructed structural features that are common to\nall the minimum-structure models may be considered nec-\nessary to fit the observed data. In all cases, the joint\ninversion was done with error thresholds of 5\u201310 percent\n(\u00b110% for apparent resistivity and 5% for phase) set for the\ndata, the same grid size (107 columns \u0002 56 rows), a regu-\nlarization or smoothing factor (t) of between 5 and 10, and\na normalized root-mean square (NRMS) error [Rodi and\nMackie, 2001] of 1.5 as the threshold misfit. The smoothing\nwas also allowed to vary with depth in different ways during\nthe inversion exercise (not presented here) but appears not\nto lead to major structural differences in the top 40 km of\nthe final models initiated with 50 to 350 Wm and 500 to\n1000 Wm half-spaces especially west of the rift valley where\nthere is good data coverage. Examples of 2-D imaging\nresults for the 100 and 1000 Wm half-spaces are shown in\nFigure 5a and 5b for the NYA-CHN transect. Both models\nequally match our field data. The fit between the field data\nand the computed responses of the model reconstructed\nfrom the 1000 Wm half-space is shown in Figures 6a and 6b\nand has an NRMS error of 1.5 for the 2862 (TE and TM\nmode) data points inverted. The TE mode LMT data at\nMOR and OLO are poorly fitted and so are the data for\nKEK which we down-weighted in the inversion (by multi-\nplying their standard errors by 2.2) for the reasons stated\nearlier. The fit between the field data and the computed\nresponses for the 100 Wm is only slightly poorer (NRMS\nerror of 1.53) than that shown in Figures 6a and 6b. There\nare some structural differences between both models illus-\ntrating the nonuniqueness of the MT inverse problem and\nextraneous information must therefore be used to select the\nmost likely model features. The common conductive struc-\ntures in both models are labeled A to H but note that their\nabsolute resistivity values are different. It is desirable to test\nwhether the field data fully constrain these conductive\nfeatures and the intervening resistive blocks using a blocky\nmodel and reliable external information.\n[16] For the blocky model study, we constructed the top\n20 km of our starting model using pieced-together results of\n1-D joint inversion [Meju, 1996] of the rotationally invari-\nant AMT and central-loop TEM data, assuming a near-\nlayered crust as suggested by the available seismic velocity\nmodel [Birt et al., 1997]. Below this 20 km crustal section,\nwe drew on the 2-D images of Figure 5a and 5b from 20 to\n48 km depth but made features C and D to be resistive and\ntheir flanking regions conductive. Below 48 km depth, we\nassigned a high resistivity (1000 Wm) to the blocks located\nwest of station SEL suggested to be conductive in the\nsmooth models (Figures 5a and 5b) and low resistivity\n(20 Wm) to areas eastward from SEL suggested to be\nresistive in the smooth models and also based on the\nqualitative analysis of LMT data presented above. Note\nthat this is equivalent to adopting bad initial model param-\neters for sub-Moho depths and may lead to an unrealistic\nresult. The grid size (107 columns \u0002 56 rows) was kept the\nsame for the several model runs testing different damping\nfactors. The optimal least squares model resulting from this\nexercise is shown in Figure 5c. The model has an NRMS\nerror of 1.74 for the 2862 data points inverted. Although the\nfit is poorer, the main resistivity features in the top 20 km\n(as well as deeper features near stations SEL and CHN) in\nthis blocky model are comparable to those of the smooth\nmodels suggesting good data constraints on these features.\nHowever, the blocky model only marginally shows the\npossible presence of feature C east of OLO at greater than\n20 km depth (cf. Figure 5a and 5c). An anomalous vertical\nconductor is suggested directly beneath OLO at 48 km\ndepth while an E-dipping conductor appears to connect\nfrom the near-surface at NGU to another conductive zone\n(feature E) at 48 km depth below the western rift margin.\nThe resistive blocks in the Loita and SEL areas seem to\nextend beyond 100 km depth in the blocky model. It would\nthus appear that the lateral extents of both the resistive and\nconductive blocks at subcrustal depths are not well-\nconstrained by the present data and\/or that the initial blocky\nmodel was unrealistic. It is also obvious from this compar-\native study that a near-horizontally layered structure may be\ninappropriate for at least the top 20 km of the crust west of\nFigure 4.

Before any geological inference can be drawn\nfrom the above resistivity models, it is important to ascer-\ntain further that all the suggested common crustal features\nare statistically robust and satisfy other available geophys-\nical data.\n3.2. Simplest Quantitative Model Appraisal\n[17] The blocky model shown in Figure 5c was selected\nfor appraisal since it contains more features than the\nminimum-structure models which could be due to overin-\nterpretation of the finite set of field data. Assuming an\naverage error level of 10 percent in our field data (cf.\nFigures 6a and 6b) and the model of Figure 5c as the\noptimal regularized inversion model (mnrms) with a normal-\nized residual error Qnrms, we sought the range of model\nparameters that will yield a threshold misfit (Qt) given by\nQt \u00bc Qnrms \u0002 1:1 \u00f01\u00de\nFigure 5. Comparison of statistically equivalent results of 2-D smoothness-constrained resistivity\ninversion and a blocky model constructed using a purposely designed poor initial model to test data\nconstraint on upper mantle structures. The smoothness-constrained models were generated using initial\nhalf-space resistivities of (a) 100 Wm and (b) 1000 Wm. In Figures 5a and 5b, the purple dashed line\nrepresents the seismic Moho [Birt et al., 1997] while the thin white lines above it indicate possible\nparallelism of the steep E-dipping segments of prominent conductive features. Simpson\u2019s [2000]\nproposed structure of the upper mantle (conductive in the west, M1; resistive in the east, M2) is indicated\nby the thick black lines in both models. The blocky 2-D inversion model is shown in Figure 5c and the\nwhite horizontal dashed line at 48 km depth marks the top of the alternating conductive and resistive\nblocks used in the starting model to test data constraint on upper mantle features. The conductive features\nlabeled A to G are common to all the models and are described in text. The MT sounding points are\ndenoted by arrows at the top of each panel.

We expect that poorly constrained parameters will\nyield a relatively wide range between the lower and upper\nsolution bounds, but note that equation (2) implies that there\nis a compensating relationship between the model para-\nmeters [cf. Meju and Hutton, 1992].\n[18] Owing to the size of the model (107 \u0002 56 cells), we\ncould not realistically extremize every resistivity cell but\ninstead focused on site-by-site data constraints. Thus for\neach MT station, we first amalgamated the resistivity blocks\nfrom locations extending midway between adjacent stations\nin the horizontal direction and also grouped blocks of\ncomparable resistivity (within 20%) in the vertical direction\nto form a column of blocks to be tested (Figure 7b). For\nconsistent sampling, an additional column of blocks was\nFigure 6a.

We then set b equal to unity and\ncalculated the parameter updates for mnrms that satisfy the\nthreshold residual, Qt and the compensating relationship\nbetween the model parameters embodied in equation (2).\nConsidering the significant averaging involved in our ap-\nproach, the resulting resistivity ranges may not be accurate\nbut will suffice for a simple model appraisal. This analysis\nseems to suggest that structures deeper than 40 km are only\nsufficiently constrained by the field data outside the Rift\nValley. In Figure 7b we present the estimated parameter\nranges for the top 40 km of a model that satisfied equation\n(1) with a normalized residual error of 1.914 for the 2862\ndata points. It can be seen from the parameter ranges that\nmany of the first-order electrical features maintain fairly\nnarrow resistivity ranges relative to the corresponding block\nresistivities in the least-squares model of Figure 7a and are\nthus deemed to be justified by the field data. The same\nconclusion was also reached by Sakkas [1999]. What is\nperhaps unexpected in this simple analysis is the suggestion\n(Figure 7b) that the shallow crustal conductor G east of\nOLO and feature D near IRK may not be well-constrained\nin the blocky model and must therefore be interpreted with\ncaution. It would also appear that a probably continuous,\neastward-tapering or dipping resistive zone may be required\nin the deep crust (10\u201330 km) across the rift valley rather\nthan the vertical through-going crustal conductive zone\nsubcropping between NGU and MAG near the western rift\nmargin as Figure 7a would suggest; however, an east-\ndipping crustal conductor (feature A) and a deeper vertical\nzone may exist at the eastern rift margin (profile position\n255\u2013270 km). In what follows, we will draw on the smooth\ninversion models which were not constructed using an\nassumed geological structure.\n3.3. First-Order Features and Relationship With\na Suggested Generic 3-D Model\n[19] Simpson\u2019s [2000] forward model comprises a N\u2013S\ntrending regional 2-D structure (shown in Figures 5a and 5b)\nwith outcroppingN\u2013S trending 2-D rift half-grabens and 3-D\nprofile-parallel deep crustal lineaments. Here, we compare\nthe first-order features in our 2-D MT models with the\nregional 2-D structures in Simpson\u2019s generic model that\nwas based on long period MV and MT phase data at only a\nfew stations (MIG, OLO, LEG, MOR, IRK, NGU, MAG,\nSIN, and LUK) and an assumed background resistivity of\n1000 Wm for the region. The important first-order features\nof our 2-D MT inversion models are as follows.\n[20] 1. The resistivity structure especially west of SIN\nconsists principally of steeply-dipping alternating thick\nresistive and relatively thin conductive units. Since the\nsub-Moho resistor beneath OLO appears to be continuous\nFigure 6b. Same as Figure 6a but for stations IRK to CHN. Note the large error bars (one standard\ndeviation) in the dead band and the generally higher quality of the LMT data.\nB04103 MEJU AND SAKKAS: MT IMAGING OF SOUTHERN KENYA\n12 of 19\nB04103\nwith a near-surface body (feature H in Figure 5), these steep\nsequences may be crustal blocks.\n[21] 2. Anomalous subhorizontal upper crustal conduc-\ntors appear to be present in the top 10\u201315 km east of the rift\nmargin (known to be highly sheared and affected by\nQuaternary volcanism) and at about 20 km depth in the\nNYA-MIG area where there was also Quaternary volcanism\nfurther north (see inset map in Figure 1).\nFigure 7.

A prominent conductive zone dips eastwards from\nthe near-surface at OLO to lower crustal depths (feature C).\nFeature C dips about 39\u0001 to the east in the top 23 km but\nappears to become steeper across the seismic Moho [Birt et\nal., 1997]. In Figure 5b, it is possible that feature C becomes\nflat at about 70 km depth before bending upward to subcrop\nat the western rift margin but this structural continuity is not\nwell-resolved by the data. Middle\/lower crust 3-D conduc-\ntive lineaments are proposed to extend from OLO to below\nboth flanks of the rift but their depth and lateral positions\nare not constrained by the MV data [Simpson, 2000,\np. 19,327]. If feature C does not extend significantly in\nour assumed strike direction, it would effectively constitute\na buried elongate 3-D conductor and may be expected to\ncause a significant phase split in unrotated MT data [cf.\nSasaki and Meju, 2006, Figure 5] as observed at OLO by\nSimpson [2000].\n[23] 4. The E-dipping segments of conductors F, C, G, A,\nand B appear to be parallel (see Figures 5a and 5b) and\nspaced 40\u201360 km apart (the spacing being estimated\nperpendicular to a dip angle of 39\u0001).\n[24] 5. There is a 50 km wide zone with 4\u20138 km thick\nrelatively conductive sequence beneath NGU to SIN in the\nRift Valley. It is shallowest in the middle near station MAG,\ndeepest in the west andmost conductive in the east (Figure 8).\nIt appears to be bordered to the east by a persistent E-dipping\ncrustal conductor (feature A) coinciding with a major rift\nfault in Figure 1. The w-shape of its bottom in Figure 8 may\nsuggest a double half-graben structure. In Simpson\u2019s model,\nthere are two 3\u20135 km deep half-grabens in the rift valley and\nelectrically conducting sediments are assumed to be deepest\nin the western half-graben.\n[25] There are thus major differences between our 2-D\ninversion models and Simpson\u2019s [2000] simple 3-D forward\nFigure 8.

The top section is an\ninterpretative model derived from combined 3-D local earthquake tomography and spatial distribution of\nhypocentres in the area [Ibs-von Seht et al., 2001]. The circles are hypocenter depths. The dashed lines\nare assumed depth ranges of active faults and the solid lines give the velocity structure determined for\nthe top 15 km of the crust [Ibs-von Seht et al., 2001].

The\ncrustal structure of the Mara-Loita area was not clearly\nimaged in the 3-D study. The area of known basement\nshearing and Quaternary volcanism [Bosworth, 1987;\nMacdonald, 2003] is characterized by sub-horizontal upper\ncrustal conductors in the 2-D models (features A and B)\ninstead of the profile-parallel lineaments placed in the\nmiddle\/lower crust underneath the rift in the model of\nSimpson [2000]. The 2-D smooth model generated from a\n1000 Wm half-space (Figure 5b) appears to be the closest to\nSimpson\u2019s interpretation of the regional structure. A perti-\nnent question here is: how consistent are the 2-D MT\nimages with the results from coincident seismic and gravity\nsurveying and geological ground-truth?\n4. Independent Model Appraisal: Consistency\nWith Other Geophysical Results\n4.1. Consistency Analysis of Shallow-Depth Resistivity\nStructure\n[26] The MT model of Figure 5b suggests the rift valley\nas consisting of a conductive cover sequence of variable\n(4\u20138 km) thickness underlain by a resistive geoelectric\nbasement. The W-shape of the interface between the con-\nductive rift sequence and the basement (Figures 5b and 8) is\nin remarkable agreement with the borehole-constrained,\nshallow-depth, seismic velocity interpretation of the rift\nvalley [see Simiyu and Keller, 2001, Figure 6]. Another\ncoincident cross section from a 3-D microseismic study of\nthe Lake Magadi area [Ibs-von Seht et al., 2001, Figure 22]\nalso produced a similar structure to that found between\nNGU and SIN in the top 10 km as shown in Figure 8. For\nthis reason, we select the model shown in Figure 5b as our\npreferred model. The seismic model of Birt et al. [1997]\nsuggests a near-layered crustal structure east of the rift and\nminor E-dipping disruption of the shallow crust in the\nvicinity of station CHN. Since this area exposes NW\u2013SE\nductile shears and thrust faults, any significant disruption of\nthe relatively flat upper crustal structure could furnish\nconstraints on the possible geometry and depth extent of\nthese fracture systems. In Figures 5 and 7, two prominent\nsubhorizontal shallow-depth conductors occur between SIN\nand CHN at about 5 to 15 km depth underneath a resistive\ncover. There is also an apparent change in the thickness of\nconductor B near station CHN in agreement with the\ncoincident seismic model [Birt et al., 1997]. Conductor B\nappears to be disrupted by a steeply dipping feature which\nmay possibly be related to the NW\u2013SE lineaments sug-\ngested on the surface. Simiyu and Keller\u2019s [2001, Figure 13]\nintegrated interpretation of the KRISP94 gravity data using\ndeep seismic refraction constraints [Birt et al., 1997] sug-\ngests an E-dipping contact in the top 15\u201318 km of the crust\nnear the Oloololo Escarpment which is in accord with the\nelectrical resistivity structure of the OLO area in the\nuppermost 10\u201320 km (Figure 5). As shown in Figure 9a,\nthe location of this steep contact coincides with a previously\npredicted suture based on Bouguer gravity anomalies [Tesha\net al., 1997, Figure 6]. Another gravity low coincides with\nthe projected outcrop zone of the sub-horizontal conductor\nA at the eastern rift margin (Figure 9a); the western edge of\nthis conductor coincides spatially with a major rift fault (see\nFigure 1). It may be significant that the geoelectrically\ninferred 50 km width of the rift zone proper (Figure 8) is\ncomparable to the 40\u201360 km separation between the E-\ndipping segments of prominent conductors (F, C, G, A, and\nB) and between the exposed NW\u2013SE fracture systems east\nof the Rift Valley (Figure 1).\n4.2. Consistency Analysis of Inferred Deep Resistivity\nStructure\n[27] On the basis of the suggested Moho depth from a\ncollocated seismic refraction survey [Birt et al., 1997], the\nanomalous resistive blocks and the intervening conductor C\nin the Mara-Loita sector extend into the uppermost mantle.\nUsing wide-angle seismic reflection data and assuming the\nroughly layered crustal structure derived by Birt et al. [1997],\nByrne et al. [1997] infer the existence of two bands of\ndiscontinuous upper mantle reflectors (mimicked by discrete,\nvery thin, high velocity layers at 51 and 63 km depths below\nthe Oloololo Escarpment, the top reflector rising gently\neastward to 43 km depth under the rift and then deepening\nto 50 km about 40 km further east). The bands of reflectors\nare superimposed on our preferredMTmodel for comparison\nin Figure 9b. The geometry of these sub-Moho reflectors is\ndifferent from the steep structure suggested in the MT model\nbut the geographical locations where the reflector continuity\nis broken appear to correlate spatially with the positions of\nconductors C, D, and E (Figures 5 and 9). Note that Birt\n[1996] identified an E-dipping reflector at 24.5 to 26 km\ndepth near the Oloololo Escarpment which is coincident with\nthe top of the anomalous resistive block beneath feature C\n(see Figure 9b). While our MT images (Figures 5 and 9b)\ndiffer significantly from the lithospheric structure suggested\nby these 2-D seismic models west of the rift valley, there are\ncommon features in the top 20 km east of the rift proper. The\nimplied steep geoelectrical structure elsewhere is structurally\nconsistent with the result of 3-D teleseismic tomography\nfor the Chyulu Hills region [Ritter and Kasper, 1997]. An\noverlapping section of seismic P-velocity perturbations\nthat runs eastwards from the SEL area for about 150 km\n(see Figures 2a and 2b) suggests the presence of E-dipping\nsteep zones of alternating high- and low-velocities extending\nthrough the crust down to over 100 km depth [Ritter and\nKasper, 1997, Figure 10]. It is significant that the spacing\nbetween the alternate zones of low- and high-velocity per-\nturbations [see Ritter and Kaspar, 1997, Figure 10] is about\n40\u201360 km which is in accord with our inference from the\nE-dipping conductors in Figures 5a and 5b. It may be no\ncoincidence that the velocity anomalies are especially promi-\nnent in the 23 to 70 km depth range [Ritter and Kasper,\n1997], which corresponds to the zone of steepest dip of\ngeoelectrical features (see Figures 9b and 9c).\n[28] The Bouguer gravity anomaly along the NYA-CHN\ntransect [Birt et al., 1997] is shown in Figure 9a for\ncomparison with the resistivity pattern. Notice that the first\n90 km of the MT profile (zone 1 in Figure 9a) is charac-\nterized by a gravity high; this correlates spatially with the\narea underlain by a persistent crustal conductor at 5\u201320 km\ndepth (feature F) that has a bow-shape or basinal cross\nsection. It also coincides spatially with an outcropping\nArchaean volcano-sedimentary (Migori greenstone) belt\n[e.g., Ichang\u2019l and MacLean, 1991]. This is followed\neastward by a zone of marked gravity low coincident with\nour profile positions 90 to 270 km (zone 2 in Figure 9a).\nB04103 MEJU AND SAKKAS: MT IMAGING OF SOUTHERN KENYA\n15 of 19\nB04103\nThe first part of this zone (position 90 to 195 km) includes\nthe Loita area where there may be a buried Archaean crust\nand duplex-structures [Mosley, 1993]. Our resistivity mod-\nels suggest the possible presence of a sequence of resistive\nand conductive units that is buckled or stacked up against\nfeature C in the Loita area (cf. Figures 5, 7, and 9b) but it\ncould also be a monolithic resistor disrupted by faulting.\nThere is a small increase in the Bouguer gravity between\npositions 195 and 270 km, coinciding with the area\ndelimited by features D and A, that spatially correlates with\nthe Kenya rift. The two minima in the regional gravity field\ncoincident with our inferred boundaries of zone 2 in Figure 9a\nhave been suggested [Tesha et al., 1997] as signatures\nrepresenting the contributions from a suture-thickened crust\n(Neoproterozoic component) and the Kenya rift (Cenozoic\ncomponent). Our MT model is consistent with the presence\nof relatively thickened upper crustal resistive blocks be-\ntween OLO and IRK in zone 2. Further east (zone 3 in\nFigure 9. Comparison of MT, seismic and gravity signatures from collocated studies of the deep\nstructure across southern Kenya.

(b) MT model\nwith superimposed (in black) sub-Moho wide-angle seismic reflectors [Byrne et al., 1997] and a crustal\nreflector [Birt, 1996] for the NYA-CHN transect. The violet horizontal dotted line at 32\u201340 km depth\nshows the seismic Moho [Birt et al., 1997]. Our inferred structural geometries in the crust and uppermost\nmantle (thick lines for principal and fine dots for subsidiary features) are shown in white. The principal\ngeological features are indicated on top of the cross-section. (c) Resistivity model for a line incorporating\nstation LUK to test further the existence of conductor A. The white line is a possible trace of conductor A.\nThe golden lines at 23 and 70 km depths delimit a possible depth interval where structures are steepest\n[cf. Ritter and Kasper, 1997, Figure 10]. There is a 25 km offset between the starting points of the MT\nand gravity surveys.\nB04103 MEJU AND SAKKAS: MT IMAGING OF SOUTHERN KENYA\n16 of 19\nB04103\nFigure 9), the Bouguer anomaly profile rises very steeply\nwhile the MT models suggest the possible presence of\nsubhorizontal crustal conductors underlain by an anomalous\nsteep resistive block with flanking conductors. As indicated\nabove, the MT results agree with the teleseismic tomo-\ngraphic results for this part of our transect [see Ritter and\nKasper, 1997, Figure 10]. There is thus good correlation\nbetween our MT and other geophysical measurements on\nthe NYA-CHN transect. We see these correspondences as\npermitting a geological discussion of our MT results but\nbearing in mind the band-limited nature of our data and the\nconsequent limitation on model resolution.\n5. Discussions\n5.1. Is There a Link Between Resistivity Heterogeneity\nand Lithospheric Segmentation?\n[29] Our electrical resistivity models (Figures 5, 7, and 9)\nsuggest the presence of significant heterogeneities in the crust\nand presumed uppermost mantle across the study region. A\nstriking feature is the predominance of a blocky structure\nrather than the nearly horizontally stratified structure sug-\ngested from other coincident 2-D surveys [e.g., Birt et al.,\n1997; Byrne et al., 1997] but this may also have been\ninfluenced by the wider station spacing used in our survey.\nThe most prominent crustal marker zones are the bow-shaped\ncraton conductor west of OLO (feature F), the steeply dipping\nconductor at OLO (feature C), and the subhorizontal con-\nductors east of the main rift (features A and B). It is also\npossible that vertical conductive zones exist beneath stations\nIRK (where feature D also has an associated gravity signa-\nture), NGU and SIN, even though the analysis presented in\nFigure 7b suggests that they are not well resolved by the MT\ndata. Notice that conductors F, C, and A in Figures 5 and 9b\nappear to be E-dipping in their western part but become\nsubhorizontal and possibly continue further east with a\nwestward (reversed?) dip suggesting some form of folding.\n[30] The geometry of feature F below the outcropping\nresistive Archaean crust probably suggests a folded or\nbuckled crustal domain. This is consistent with geological\nobservations of major folding and thrusting in this Archaean\nsector [e.g., Pinna et al., 2000]. Feature F appears to be\nseparated from feature C by a thin steep resistor (feature H)\nthat connects to the anomalous resistive block beneath\nfeature C in the OLO area. Is the resistive block directly\nabove feature C a dismembered Archaean crust? Mosley\n[1993] predicts that an Archaean crust is buried by duplex-\nstructures in the Loita area. The MT models suggest the\npossible presence of alternating resistive and conductive\nbuckled units above feature C in the Mara-Loita sector\n(position 90 to 195 km) which may thus be part of a fold\nand thrust belt. The region from position 195 to 270 km\nappears to be an extensively faulted crustal upwarp (near-\nvertical conductors are apparent at IRK, NGU, and SIN). East\nof the rift margin (zone 3 in Figure 9), the upper crustal\nstructure is strikingly subhorizontal but this could be a\nconsequence of the sparse data sampling or the obliquity of\nour survey line to the regional structural trend. We noted that\ninverting the MT data for a subset of stations (KEK to LUK)\nlying parallel to the profile of Rooney and Hutton [1977]\n(see Figure 1) or for stations NYA to LUK (Figure 9c) did\nnot eliminate the need for conductor A, which appears as a\nprominent 38\u0001 E-dipping feature that flattens at 20 km depth\nand possibly suggests that a major thrust-like feature sepa-\nrates zone 2 from the LUK area of outcropping Mozambique\nbelt (Table 1).\n[31] It would thus appear that the evinced regionalisation\nof resistivity structures from west to east probably reflects\nsome form of lithospheric-scale structural segmentation (or\nbuckling) and compositional zoning, with the main zones\nbeing delimited by conductive features (Figure 9b). These\nzones appear to coincide spatially with positions of change\nin geological patterns on the surface, and their principal\nelectrical conductors coincide with positions of low\nBouguer gravity anomalies (see Figure 9a) and low seismic\nvelocities [e.g., Ritter and Kasper, 1997; Tesha et al., 1997;\nSimiyu and Keller, 2001]. We therefore propose that there is\na possible link between the imaged deep resistivity hetero-\ngeneity and surface-mapped deformation both in the craton\nand the MOB of southern Kenya. The rifting and magma-\ntism in the study region are probably localized by preexist-\ning lithospheric heterogeneity as also suggested by past\nstudies based on different geophysical measurements [e.g.,\nSmith and Mosley, 1993; Birt et al., 1997] but we illuminate\nthe steep structure of this possible thrust and fold belt and\nopine that the lithosphere may be severely buckled in the\nregion. It is significant that a proposed division of the\nbasement geology of this region into three NW\u2013SE striking\nblocks or domains comprising the Archaean Tanzanian\ncraton, an intermediate zone of reworked Archaean rocks\nand the Proterozoic Mozambique belt [Smith and Mosley,\n1993] is in good agreement with our inferred crustal\nzonation in southern Kenya (Figure 9). The 100-km-wide\nzone of reworked Archaean observed in northwest Kenya\nand which played a central role in the proposition of Smith\nand Mosley [1993] appears to correlate with our zone 2.\n5.2. Electrical Conductors: Partial Melt, Sutures,\nor Reactivated Shear Zones?\n[32] What is the nature or role of the evinced conductive\nzones in the different crustal compartments? The superficial\nconductor on the rift floor may correspond to the infill of\nsediments and volcanic debris impregnated with hot saline\nfluids. Conductor B may be a permeable fluid migration\npathway impregnated with hot or salty volcanogenic fluids\nsince it is restricted to an area of intensely sheared basement\n[Smith and Mosley, 1993] and recent volcanism [Bosworth,\n1987]. Note that if conductor B is cut by the steep shallow-\ndepth conductors suggested to be related to the outcropping\nNW\u2013SE lineaments (Figure 9b), then it must be a preexisting\nfeature in the basement rather than a product of recent off-\naxis magmatism. Another plausible explanation, drawing\non what is emerging from MT studies of other active rift\nsystems [e.g., Oskooi et al., 2005], is that it could be a clay-\nmineralized geochemical alteration zone above a differently\naltered, electrically resistive preexisting basement or juvenile\ncrust. The deep conductive zones at the rift margins and the\nill-constrained flat conductor (feature E) beneath the inferred\nresistive block across the rift valley (Figures 5 and 9) may\nthus be part of an alteration halo and not a partial melt.\nCan this explain the zone of microseismicity confined at\n12\u201325 km depth [Ibs-von Seht et al., 2001] in the resistive\ncrust within the rift zone (Figure 8)? It is noteworthy that\nSimiyu and Keller [2001] suggest that the low velocities and\nB04103 MEJU AND SAKKAS: MT IMAGING OF SOUTHERN KENYA\n17 of 19\nB04103\ndensities observed under the western flank of the rift prob-\nably represent reworked Archaean Tanzania craton.\n[33] Conductor F spatially underlies the Archaean Migori\ngreenstone belt stretching E\u2013W for 80 km [Ichang\u2019l and\nMacLean, 1991]. If this conductor were an Archaean volca-\nno-sedimentary layer, we may invoke metallic sulphide\nmineralization and\/or graphitization as a possible electrical\nconduction mechanism. However, while the coincident\nBouguer gravity anomaly profile (Figure 9a) would suggest\nthe presence of excess mass in this locality, the absence of\nanomalous high-velocity layer corresponding to feature F in\nthe collocated seismic velocity model [Birt et al.,1997] is\ninconsistent with large-scale massive sulphide mineraliza-\ntion. Instead, a reflective midcrustal boundary at 17 km\ndepth [Birt et al., 1997] coincides with the base of feature F,\nwhich may thus be a low-velocity or low-density feature\nsuch as a sag basin buried by overthrust Archaean basement\nor volcanic arc fragment [cf. Solon et al., 2005]. It is\nperhaps significant that a small fault-bounded basin is\nsuggested near OLO (Figure 1) while the Nyanza rift zone\n(NRZ in Figure 1) occurs further north from station NYA.\nHowever, our preferred explanation is that the principal\nconductive markers are probably reactivated Precambrian\nshear zones or deformed mechanically weak layers between\nrigid crystalline blocks that may have served for preferential\ntransport or fluid focusing in the region. Our reasoning here\nis based on two important observations. First, they appear to\nhave coincident low resistivity and Bouguer gravity anoma-\nlies (Figure 9a) and low seismic P-velocities [e.g., Ritter\nand Kasper, 1997]. Second, the localities of known Holo-\ncene volcanoes in the region (see Figure 1 and inset map)\nroughly coincide with the positions where anomalous steeply\ndipping sub-Moho conductors are well-developed on the\nNYA-CHN transect, specifically near NYA, MAG-SIN, and\nthe Chyulu Hills.\n[34] Note that some problems are left unresolved in this\nstudy. While conductor C may have separated different\ncontinental blocks, it is possible that postsuturing events\nhave modified the region to the extent that it is difficult to\nclarify whether it is the true suture zone between the\nTanzania craton and the MOB [e.g., Tesha et al., 1997]\nand not one of several possible exposures of the same units\nrepeated by large-scale periodic folding and thrusting. It is\nalso unclear how the Neoproterozoic ophiolite and granulite\ntrains seen on the surface further north of our study area\n(Figure 1) are related to the proposed basement heteroge-\nneity. Is the entire lithosphere buckled by horizontal com-\npression related to Precambrian collision or later far-field\ntectonics (e.g., owing to mid-Atlantic or mid-Indian Ocean\nridge-push forces [Zoback, 1992]) such that these ophiolites\nand granulites are repeated at upwarped crustal sections? Is\nthe Kenya rift a buckle-induced feature given that it appears\nto be located on what might be a crustal upward (Figures 5\nand 9)? How is lithospheric buckling related to the observed\nCenozoic volcanism? Is it the case that buckling lifted the\nborders of inverted preexisting basins forming antiforms\nwhose uplifted margins became rapidly eroded facilitating\nthe exhumation of deeper rocks (such as the granulites\nfound near the margins of zones 1 and 2 (Figure 1)\n[Shackleton, 1986; Smith and Mosley, 1993]) leading ulti-\nmately to adiabatic decompression and fusion? Answers to\nthese questions will have to await another integrated,\npreferably 3-D, field experiment.\n6. Conclusion\n[35] We have investigated the structure of the crust and\nupper mantle in southern Kenya using 2-D magnetotelluric\ndata imaging. The models reconstructed using different\ninversion approaches show many common features. A\nsimple model appraisal suggests that most of these common\nmodel features are consistent with the field data. Compar-\nisons of the resistivity models and other geophysical results\nfrom collocated surveys show that the models are robust and\nalso provide new information. The MT models suggest\nlithospheric-scale resistivity heterogeneity and possible lat-\neral structural and\/or compositional zoning from west to\neast in our study area. The electrical crust appears to consist\nof alternate east-dipping resistive and conductive blocks\nrather than continuous horizontally stratified layers. There is\na major E-dipping conductor at Oloololo but the true suture\nzone between the Tanzania craton and the Proterozoic\nMozambique orogenic belt may lie east of the Rift Valley.\nThe areas between the Oloololo and Irkimba escarpments and\neast of the rift valley are characterized by anomalously thick\ncrust while the Kenya Rift valley and the exposed Archaean\nsector betweenMigori and Oloololo appear to have relatively\nthinner electrically resistive crust. We have shown that there\nappears to be a strong link between deep electrical heteroge-\nneity and major geological features seen on the surface.\n[36] Acknowledgments. We are grateful to F.
