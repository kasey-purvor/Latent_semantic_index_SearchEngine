The best treatment (resveratrol) was tested on natural grain. The ED50 values for\ngrowth inhibition by ESOs were 200-300 \u00b5g g-1 at the aw and temperatures tested. For\nresveratrol this varied from <50 \u00b5g g-1 at 0.90-0.95 aw and >350 at 0.995 aw at both\ntemperatures. The ED50 values for OTA control were slightly lower than for control of\ngrowth, with approx 200 \u00b5g g-1 required for the ESOs and 50-100 \u00b5g g-1 of the antioxidant, at\n0.90\/0.95 aw and both temperatures. In wet grain (0.995 aw) higher concentrations were\nrequired. For growth there were statistically significant effects of single, two and three way\ninteractions between treatments except for concentration x temperature and concentration x\ntemperature x essential oil\/antioxidant treatment. For OTA control, statistically significant\ntreatments were aw, temperature x aw, concentration x temperature, treatment x concentration,\nand three way interaction of concentration x aw x treatment for P. verrucosum and A.\nwesterdijkiae. Subsequent studies were done with the best treatment (resveratrol, 200 \u00b5g g-1)\non natural wheat grain with either P. verrucosum or A. westerdijkiae at 0.85-0.995 aw and\n15\/25oC over 28 days storage. This showed that the populations of the mycotoxigenic species\nand OTA contamination could be reduced by >60% by this treatment at the end of the storage\nperiod.\n31. Introduction\nThe contamination of cereals with ochratoxin (OTA) occurs predominantly post-harvest, and\nis caused by Penicillium verrucosum, especially in northern Europe where cooler damp\nharvesting conditions exists (Magan & Olsen, 2004). Inefficiently dried grain can result in\npockets of growth by P. verrucosum in storage (Magan et al., 2003; Magan et al., 2004).\nThere has thus been interest in determining potential treatments which could effectively\ncontrol this important mycotoxigenic species. While moist grain is sometimes treated with\naliphatic acid-based treatments, these are often fungistats, and require very efficient\ncoverage to be effective. Sub-optimal concentrations can result in a stimulation of OTA\nproduction by P. verrucosum strains (Arroyo et al., 2005).\nRecent studies have attempted to determine the efficacy of extracts from selected\nplants as antimicrobial and antifungal agents. Some studies have shown that specific\nessential oils can control spore germination and growth of mycotoxigenic spoilage fungi. For\nexample, screening of essential oils suggested that oregano and thyme essential oils inhibited\nthe growth of Aspergillus niger van Tieghem, Aspergillus westerdijkiae and Aspergillus\nflavus Link (Magan et al., 2004). Antioxidants have also been demonstrated to inhibit fungal\ngrowth and some are already used as preservatives in food. Thompson (1994) studied the\neffects of esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (paraben) on the growth of three mycotoxigenic\nfungi. Butyl and propyl parabens were the most effective, completely inhibiting mycelial\ngrowth at 1.0-2.0 mM concentration. However, the impact of environmental factors were not\nconsidered in these previous studies. Screening of about 25 essential oils showed that\ncinnamon leaf, clove bud and thyme were the most effective essential oils in vitro over a\nrange of environmental factors in controlling growth of P. verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae\n(Cairns et al., 2003; Hope et al., 2003, 2005). Studies of antioxidants have shown that some\n4parabens and resveratrol, an extract of grape skin, were effective at controlling a range of\nmycotoxigenic species on maize (Fanelli et al., 2003). However, detailed studies of efficacy\nof these essential oils and antioxidants for controlling P. verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae\nand OTA production on wheat grain under different environmental conditions has not been\ndetermined. Cairns-Fuller et al. (2005) detailed the optimum and marginal environmental\nconditions for growth and OTA production by P. verrucosum on wheat grain while Linblad\net al. (2004) determined the environmental conditions and contamination levels which may\nlead to OTA contamination above the legislative limit. The ecological conditions for growth\nand production of OTA by A. westerdijkiae has been previously identified and were different\nfrom P. verrucosum (Ramos et al., 1998).\nThe objectives of this study were to (a) examine the efficacy of cinnamon leaf, clove\nbud and thyme essential oils and the antioxidant resveratrol against P. verrucosum and A.\nwesterdijkiae and OTA production on irradiated wheat grain under different environmental\nconditions (15, 25oC; 0.995-0.90 aw); (b) determine ED50 values for control; and (c)\ninvestigate treatment of naturally contaminated stored wheat grain with the best treatment\n(resveratrol) to examine control of P. verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae, total fungal\npopulations and OTA contamination at 0.995-0.85 aw and the two temperatures.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1 Fungal species and isolates\nA strain of P. verrucosum (OTA11) isolated from wheat grain and with a known\nhistory of OTA production was used in this study (Linblad et al., 2004; Cairns-Fuller et al.,\n2005). This was kindly supplied by Dr. M. Olsen, National Food Administration, Uppsala,\nSweden. An OTA producing isolate of Aspergillus westerdijkiae (=A. ochraceus;\n5IBT21991) was kindly supplied by Dr. P.V. Nielsen, Technical University of Denmark,\nLyngby, Denmark.\n2.2 Studies on gamma irradiated wheat grain\nStudies were carried out with gamma irradiated (12kGy) wheat grain with retained\ngerminative capacity which was modified to 0.90, 0.95 and 0.995 aw by the addition of\nsterile water using a moisture adsorption curve (Cairns-Fuller et al., 2005). The treatments\nwere mixed regularly and stored at 4oC for 24-36 hrs to allow equilibration. The essential\noils (F.D. Copeland & Sons, Ltd., London) were dissolved in 10ml methanol to produce final\nconcentrations of 5, 50, 150 and 500 \u00b5g g-1 grain (w\/w). The control was treated with\nmethanol only. The resveratrol treatment consisted of using Resvin, a commercial product\ncontaining 10% w\/w concentration of resveratrol. This was dissolved in ethanol and 0, 50\nand 150 \u00b5g g-1 treatment concentrations prepared. The grain treatments were equilibrated at\n4oC for 72 hrs and shaken regularly to ensure a good even distribution of treatments. The aw\nof treatments was checked with an Aqualab (CX-2, Decagon Devices Inc, U.S.A.). Grain\nwas placed in monolayers in 90 mm Petri dishes and centrally inoculated with 50 \u00b5l of 1 x\n106 spores ml-1 of P. verrucosum or A. westerdijkiae obtained from a 10 days old wheat (2%)\nagar culture medium. The experiments were carried out with 3 replicates per treatment and\nrepeated twice. The Petri plates were placed in humidity chambers in which glycerol\/water\nsolutions were used to maintain the equilibrium relative humidity the same as the treatment\naw levels. These were incubated at 15 and 25oC for up to 28 days. The colonisation rates\nwere measured regularly by taking two measurements at right angles to each other. The\nslopes of the regression lines were used to plot the relationship between treatment conditions\nand environmental conditions. The control colonisation rates were used to determine the\n6relative concentrations of the essential oils and resveratrol to inhibit growth and OTA\nproduction by 50% (ED50 values).\n2.3 In situ effect of resveratrol on fungal populations and OTA control in stored wheat grain\ninoculated with P. verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae under different environmental\nconditions\nSub-samples of freshly harvested winter wheat grain (1000g) were placed in flasks.\nWater was added to obtain the required water activity levels (0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95 and 0.995\naw) and treated with resveratrol to obtain a final concentration of 200 \u00b5g g-1. The treatment\nwas dissolved in 10 ml ethanol before adding to the grain. The control treatments were all\ntreated with 10 ml ethanol only. 100 g sub-samples of treated wheat grain were placed in\nsolid culture vessels (Magenta, Sigma Ltd, U.K.). The treated wheat grain was then\ninoculated with 1 ml of 102 spores of P. verrucosum or A. westerdijkiae and mixed\nthoroughly before incubation in controlled environment chambers which were maintained at\nthe same equilibrium relative humidity conditions as the grain treatments. They were all\nincubated at 15 and 25oC for up to 28 days. Experiments were carried out with five\nreplicates per treatment and carried out twice.\nSamples were removed after 7 and 28 days for fungal population assessment. They\nwere assessed by serial dilution using three replicate sub-samples of 1 g of wheat grain in 9\nml sterile water (+ 0.01% Tween 80) on malt extract and DYSG media at the same aw as the\ntreatment. The latter medium is selective for P. verrucosum and distinguishes the\nmycotoxigenic species from other Penicillia by the characteristic brick red reverse. A.\nwesterdijkiae was identified by morphological and sporulation characteristics. Samples were\nextracted for OTA after 28 days.\n72.4 Ochratoxin extraction and analysis\nThe experiment was terminated at 28 days and the samples dried at 50oC for 48 hrs.\nThe samples were milled and a 20g sub-sample extracted with 50 ml of methanol and\nanalysed for OTA using HPLC and fluorescence detection. The sample was shaken for 24\nhrs at 110 rpm and 25oC in the dark. Samples were then all filtered through filter paper\n(Whatman, No. 4) containing 5-10 g of Celite 545 (Aldrich Chemical Co., U.K.) for clean up\nof the sample and to improve final extract. From each sample 1ml was removed and\ncentrifuged at 1100 rpm for 15 mins for final purification. The supernatant of each sample\nwas removed and placed in HPLC amber vials for analyses.\nThe HPLC system used consisted of a Millipore Waters 600E system controller, a\nMillipore 712 WISP autosampler and a Millipore Waters 470 scanning fluorescence detector\n(Millipore Corporation Massachusetts USA)(excitation 330 nm, emission 460 nm). The\nsamples were separated using a C18 Luna Spherisorb ODS2 column (150 x 4.6mm, 5\u03bcm)\n(Phenomenex, Macclesfield, U.K.), with a guard column of the same material. Run time for\nsamples was 12 minutes with OTA being detected at about 5.75 minutes. The flow rate of\nthe mobile phase (acetonitrile:water:acetic acid; 57:41:2) was 1 ml min-1. Standards used\nwere 50-1200 ng ml-1. The recovery rate was 78% for wheat grain with a limit of detection\nof <0.01 \u03bcg OTA g-1 medium, based on a signal to noise ratio of 3:1. Analysis of the results\nwas carried out on a computer with Kroma systems 2000 software (Bio-tek Instruments,\nMilan, Italy).\n2.5 Statistical analyses of data\nAll data was subjected to statistical analyses. Two and three-way interactions were\nexamined using Analysis of Variance and the software programme Minitab 13.32 (Minitab\nInc, USA.). Where appropriate LSD between treatments were calculated at the P=0.05 level.\n83. RESULTS\n3.1 Effect of essential oils and resveratrol on colonisation of layers of wheat grain\nFigure 1 shows an example of the efficacy of the treatments on growth rate of P.\nverrucosum and A. westerdijkiae in relation to up to 500 \u00b5g g-1 at 0.95 and 0.90 aw, and 15\nand 25oC. Generally, growth was relatively unaffected by 50 \u00b5g g-1 of essential oils, while at\nthis concentration, resveratrol sometimes gave >50% inhibition of mycelial colonisation of\nwheat grain. However, 500 \u00b5g g-1 of all treatments was required for >90% inhibition of\ngrowth. Table 1 shows the ED50 concentrations of treatments required to inhibit colonisation\nof the grain by both P. verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae. For growth there were statistically\nsignificant effects of single, two and three way interactions between treatments except for\nconcentration x temperature and concentration x temperature x essential oil\/antioxidant\ntreatment.\n3.2 Effects of essential oils and resveratrol on OTA production\nFigure 2 shows an example of the efficacy of treatments on OTA production at 0.95\naw and 15 and 25oC after 28 days incubation for both P. verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae.\nThe trend in control of OTA is similar to that for growth. However, resveratrol was able to\ncompletely inhibit OTA at 500 \u00b5g g-1 for P. verrucosum. Only the lowest concentration (50\n\u03bcg g-1) appeared to stimulate OTA production by A. westerdijkiae. Overall, resveratrol was\nmore effective than the three essential oils in controlling OTA production. Table 2 confirms\nthat the efficacy of resveratrol (ED50 values) was greater than the essential oil treatments\nunder most of the treatment conditions tested.\n93.3 Control of P. verrucosum, A. westerdijkiae and OTA production with resveratrol in\nnatural stored wheat grain\nThe efficacy of resveratrol on the total populations of fungi and P. verrucosum or A.\nwesterdijkiae over a range of aw conditions are shown in Figure 3. The total fungal\npopulations increased with stored grain wetness from 0.85 to 0.995 aw. The presence of the\ninoculum increased the overall populations of fungi in some cases. Both the total fungal\npopulations, and that of P. verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae were significantly inhibited by\ntreatment with resveratrol over the storage time of 28 days when compared with the control\ntreatments. Overall, >60% inhibition of P. verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae populations\noccurred by treatment with resveratrol. Statistical analyses showed that aw, temperature,\ntime and resveratrol all significantly affected P.verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae populations.\nThe effect of treatments on OTA production after 28 days storage at 15 and 25oC for\nboth P. verrucosum and A. westerdijkiae are shown in Table 3. The highest OTA content\nwas found in the 0.95 aw treatments, regardless of whether inoculum of P. verrucosum or A.\nwesterdijkiae were used. Grain treated with resveratrol had significantly less OTA than the\nuntreated controls. Again OTA contamination was reduced by > 60% in most of the\ntreatment conditions. Statistical analyses showed that aw, temperature, time and treatment\nand interactions between these factors all significantly affected OTA content. The statistical\nanalyses for one data set is shown in Table 4.\n4. DISCUSSION\nThis study has shown that the three essential oils are not as effective as the\nantioxidant resveratrol in controlling growth of P. verrucosum and A.westerdijkiae\ncolonising wheat grain. The ED50 values confirm that for controlling both growth and OTA\n10\nproduction by these two species is more efficient with the antioxidant. A. westerdijkiae is\nmainly isolate from warmer climates and thus grew better at 25oC than P. verrucosum\n(Magan and Aldred, 2006). It was noticeable that at 50 \u00b5g ml-1 there was often some\nstimulation of OTA production by both essential oil and the antioxidant treatments. However,\nwhen higher concentrations were used >50% control was achieved, especially with the\nresveratrol treatment. The aw conditions used in these studies represent the important range\nwhere poorly dried conditions can lead to spoilage post-harvest.\nInhibition of growth and toxin production do not always occur together. For example,\nprevious studies with Fusarium culmorum (W.G.Smith) and Fusarium graminearum\nSchwabe showed that growth was significantly inhibited by 500 \u00b5g g-1 cinnamon oil at\n0.955aw\/25\u00b0C yet toxin production was enhanced (Hope et al., 2005). This is similar to the\nresults of Magan et al. (2002) who found that suboptimal levels of fungicides stimulated\nDON production by F. culmorum in wheat grain. The additional stress of the fungicidal\nagents combined with water stress may stimulate mycotoxin production as a defence reaction.\nFurther, stress conditions can be imposed by sub-optimal fungicides alone (Magan and\nAldred, 2007). This was supported by Kang et al. (2001) who demonstrated that DON levels\nin the cell walls, cytoplasm, mytochondria and vacuoles of the hyphae of F. culmorum was\nsignificantly higher than the control for growth that occurred in the presence of the\nfungicides metaconazole and tebuconazole (20 \u03bcg ml-1).\nIn this study only resveratrol was examined in naturally contaminated wheat grain.\nThese studies were carried out at a single concentration of resveratrol to determine the short\nterm efficacy over the whole water content range representative of poorly stored grain. By\naddition of either mycotoxigenic species it was possible to ensure that contamination and\nOTA was produced in the wheat grain. The total populations of fungi were reduced by the\npresence of resveratrol significantly, often by about 1-3 log CFU. However, the CFUS of the\n11\nmycotoxigenic moulds were reduced by about 1-2 logs. It appeared to be more effective\nagainst P. verrucosum than A. westerdijkiae. Fanelli et al. (2003) examined antioxidants such\nas resveratrol on P. verrucosum and Fusarium graminearum and OTA and Deoxynivalenol,\nrespectively. They found that resveratrol at 230 \u00b5g g-1 and BHA at 0.2% were very effective\nin inhibiting 90% of OTA production at 0.95 and 0.85 aw on sterilised wheat grain. This also\nmirrored the ergosterol content used as a biomass marker. On natural wheat grain they found\nthat efficacy of 23 ppm was more effective at 0.85 than 0.95 aw.\nStudies have been conducted to determine the antimicrobial effect of essential oil\nactive components. However, this has resulted in conflicting results. Limonene and terpinene\nare the two main components of carrot seed oil. The inhibition of Aspergillus parasiticus\nSpeare was found to be higher for the components than for the complete oil (Batt et al.,\n1983). In contrast the oils derived from orange or lemon peel were more effective at\ncontrolling growth and aflatoxin production than was d-limonene the main constitute of the\ntwo peel oils (Alderman & Marth, 1976). Cinnamic aldehyde and eugenol, the major\nconstituents of cinnamon and clove oils were found to inhibit mould growth (Bullerman et\nal., 1977). Paster et al. (1994) found that thyme essential oil was more inhibitory than the\nindividual components. It was suggested that essential oil activity resulted mainly from\nsynergistic or cumulative effects existing between the components. However, more\ninformation on the mode of action of such oils is required to identify such possible\nsynergism.\nOther anti-oxidants (BHA, propyl paraben) have been also shown to be effective\nagainst Fusarium Section Liseola species. Etcheverry et al. (2002) found that BHA and\npropyl paraben inhibited Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum growth and production\nof fumonisins. Subsequent studies also suggested that using low concentrations of two\nantioxidants may have a synergistic inhibitory effect on growth of these fumonisin producing\n12\nspecies (Reynoso et al., 2002). Recent studies by Passone et al. (2007) suggest that binary\nand tertiary mixtures of analytical and industrial grade parabens were effective against A.\nflavus and aflatoxin production in short term storage of peanuts. The mechanism of action of\nantioxidants for inhibiting mycelial growth of toxigenic fungi is however not clear. It is\nknown that the effectiveness of the parabens increases with an increase in the chain length of\nthe ester group (Thompson et al., 1993; Thompson, 1994). Khan et al. (2001) suggested that\npropyl paraben and BHA appear to work mainly at the cell membrane level eliminating the\npH related component of the protomotive force and affecting energy transduction and\nsubstrate transport. BHA has also been shown to have a direct effect on the mitochondrial\nelectron chain of trypanosomes, thus inhibiting respiration.\nResveratrol appears to be more effective than parabens. The fact that industrial grade\nantioxidants may have as good efficacy as analytical grade chemicals (Passone et al., 2007)\nsuggests that opportunities do exist for the utilization of such chemicals. The cost of\nresveratrol is becoming cheaper as efficiency of extraction and production methods improve.\nThis suggests that antioxidants such as resveratrol, perhaps of industrial quality, may have\ngood applications in both raw commodities destined for human consumption directly and for\nanimal feed preservation. Resveratrol is also recommended as a health supplement for some\ngroups of consumers and thus may ultimately be a more acceptable additive than some of the\naliphatic acids employed at present.\n5.
