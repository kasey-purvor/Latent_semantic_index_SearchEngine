If suitable optoelectronic components could\nbe made available one can envisage a wide variety of appli-\ncations, including chemical process control, environmental\nmonitoring of atmospheric pollution, and free space optical\ncommunications. One promising approach is to use the GaIn-\nAsPSb pentanary alloys because for a given value of the\nband gap \u0002or lattice constant\u0003 properties such as the refrac-\ntive index, spin-orbit valence band splitting \u0002\u0004so\u0003, or thermal\nexpansion coefficient can be independently varied.2,3 This\noffers a different approach to control optical confinement,\ncarrier leakage, IVBA, and Auger recombination. However,\nalthough GaInAsPSb alloys have been grown, there has been\nvery little work in this area.4,5 Luminescence emission prop-\nerties of broken gap GaInAsSbP\/InAs isotype heterostruc-\ntures and prototype light emitting diodes and photodiodes at\nshort wavelengths \u0002\u0005\u00064 \u0002m\u0003 have been reported for alloys\ngrown by liquid phase epitaxy \u0002LPE\u0003 lattice matched onto\nInAs.6,7 Recently, AlGaInAsSb alloys grown by molecular\nbeam epitaxy have been effectively used as the barrier layers\nin room temperature midinfrared quantum well lasers.8 In\nthis letter the epitaxial growth of GaInAsPSb\/GaSb p-i-n\nstructures from the liquid phase and a study of their elec-\ntroluminescence properties are presented.\nEpitaxial growth of Ga1\u2212xInxAsyPzSbl-y-z single epilayers\nas well as p-i-n homostructures in which p-type layers were\ndoped with Zn \u00021\u00031018 cm\u22123\u0003 and n-type layers were doped\nwith Te \u00024\u00031017 cm\u22123\u0003 was carried out from antimony-rich\nmelts onto Ge doped p-type GaSb \u0002100\u0003 substrates. The use\nof antimony as the solvent for LPE growth of GaSb-related\nalloys has some advantages9,10 compared with the more con-\nventional techniques based on the low melting point metals,\nusing In or Ga as solvents, namely,\n\u00021\u0003 Growth from Sb solution decreases the concentration of\nstoichiometric defects such as VGa+GaSb,\n\u00022\u0003 etchback of the GaSb substrate is essentially decreased,\nleading to improved crystalline quality of the epitaxial\nlayers and the heterostructure as a whole, and\n\u00023\u0003 the same solvent can be used for all stages of the het-\nerostructure epitaxy \u0002which may also include AlGaIn-\nAsSb layers\u0003, making it possible to obtain high\nreproducibility.\nGrowth melts were prepared from 6N Sb and 7N In pure\nmetals, while the sources of Ga, As, and P were undoped\npolycrystalline GaSb, InAs, and InP binary compounds.\nGrowth was implemented from supercooled melts at tem-\nperatures within the interval 585\u2013600 \u00b0C. In each case be-\nfore the deposition of GaInAsPSb alloys a GaSb undoped\np-type buffer layer was grown on the substrate.\nIn addition to structural characterization the subsequent\ninvestigation of the epitaxial structures included photolumi-\nnescence \u0002PL\u0003 and electroluminescence \u0002EL\u0003 measurements.\nTemperature dependent PL measurements over the range\n4\u2013300 K were carried out using an argon-ion laser \u0002488 nm\u0003\nfor excitation of the sample. EL was measured in the tem-\nperature range 77\u2013300 K from mesa etched homojunction\np-i-n LED chips that were 750 \u0002m in diameter. These were\nprepared using standard photolithographic techniques and\nmounted episide up onto To-49 headers.\nThe thickness of the resulting epilayers was in the range\n1.0\u20133.5 \u0002m when using a crystallization rate of\n4\u20137 \u0002m\/min and a supercooling \u0004T in the range 8\u201315 \u00b0C.\nCrystal perfection of the epilayers was measured using high-\nresolution double crystal x-ray diffraction.

In the homojunction p-i-n struc-\ntures the composition of all the constituent epilayers was\nfound to be identical. For selected samples secondary ion\nmass spectrometry was used. The resulting depth profile of a\nsingle GaInAsPSb epilayer grown on GaSb revealed that the\nheterointerface between the substrate and epilayer was\nabrupt. This confirms that interphase redistribution of com-\nponents across the melt-substrate interface was absent during\nthe epitaxial growth process.\nThe PL emission spectra from a single undoped epitaxial\nlayer measured over a range of temperatures are shown in\nFig. 1. The emission was broad with the principal peak shift-\ning to the blue before following the more usual redshift as-\nsociated with band gap narrowing. The integrated PL was\nmore intense \u0002typically \u00033\u0003 and exhibited superior tempera-\nture quenching behavior compared with other InAs and In-\nAsSb alloys with similar band gap values.11 The temperature\ndependence of the band gap and the PL intensity followed\nclosely that obtained in the literature for AlGaAsSb quater-\nnary alloys containing compositional inhomogeneity due to\nphase separation.12 In this case variation in the alloy compo-\nsition produces fluctuation of the electrostatic potential and\nresults in radiative transitions from localized states near the\nband edges. The competition between band-band recombina-\ntion and that from the localized levels leads to the observed\nspectral behavior.\nHomojunction p-i-n GaInAsPSb LED structures were\nfabricated and the electroluminescence emission spectra\nmeasured from one of these diodes are shown in Fig. 2. A\nbright EL signal was obtained over the temperature range\n77\u2013300 K in forward bias. A single broad peak at 305 meV\nwas observed at 300 K. The atmospheric absorption of CO2\nin the optical path near 4.3 \u0002m is clearly evident in the spec-\ntra. The integrated emission intensity was greater than that\nobtained from InAsSb LEDs with similar band gap values\ngrown on GaSb made previously in our laboratory.13 The EL\nspectrum is compared with the PL spectrum obtained from\nan undoped GaInAsPSb epilayer in Fig. 3. The PL peak is\nobtained at higher energy and indicates that the EL emission\noriginates from the p-region of the p-i-n diode due to pre-\ndominantly electron injection arising from the higher mobil-\nity of electrons compared with holes in these materials. The\nenergy shift \u000224 meV\u0003 is consistent with band gap narrowing\nassociated with recombination via band tail states due to the\nZn doping \u00021\u00031018 cm\u22123\u0003 in the p layer of the p-i-n\nstructure.14 We note that the reproducibility of the epitaxial\ngrowth was sufficiently good so that the compositional fluc-\ntuation between different growth runs was small \u0002typically\nwithin 1%\u0003 and consequently cannot account for the differ-\nence in band gap energy between PL and EL samples.\nFIG. 1. \u0002Color online\u0003 Temperature dependent PL spectra of\nGa0.03In0.97As0.84P0.05Sb0.11 single heteroepitaxial layer grown on GaSb sub-\nstrate by LPE.\nFIG. 2. \u0002Color online\u0003 \u0002a\u0003 EL spectra of homojunction p-i-n\nGaInAsPSb\/p-GaSb LED at different temperatures and \u0002b\u0003 300 K EL\nemission.\nFIG. 3. \u0002Color online\u0003 Comparison of PL from an undoped epilayer and EL\nfrom a homojunction p-i-n GaInAsPSb\/p-GaSb LED at 77 K.\n211115-2 Krier et al.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\nA study of the electroluminescence and the light-current\ncharacteristic revealed that the recombination is dominated\nby radiative transitions at room temperature which is consis-\ntent with the PL behavior.\nAnalysis shows that the addition of phosphorus to the\nGa1\u2212xInxAsyPzSbl-y-z alloy increases the spin-orbit splitting\n\u0002\u0004so\u0003 and when the phosphorus composition z is in the range\n0.02\u0007z\u00070.10, \u0004so is greater than the band gap Eg. In this\ncase, suppression of non-radiative Auger mechanism involv-\ning the spin orbit split off band takes place.15 However, in\nboth our PL and EL experiments we estimate that the carrier\nexcitation density is approximately 1016 cm\u22123. In this case\nAuger recombination is unlikely to be important and we con-\nsider that the dominant mechanism is radiative recombina-\ntion. We attribute the temperature dependence of the PL and\nthe improved electroluminescence to recombination from lo-\ncalized states arising from electrostatic potential fluctuations\ndue to compositional inhomogeneities in these alloys.12 With\nincreasing temperature these transitions give way to free-to-\nbound transitions. We associate the localization with spin-\nodal decomposition of the pentanary alloy, even though the\nsurfaces of the epilayers were featureless when examined\nusing the Nomarski microscope and x-ray diffraction spectra\nalso revealed no evidence of compositional inhomogeneities.\nOur findings are in good agreement with those for AlGaAsSb\nlattice matched to InP where compositional modulation\n\u0002\u000615 nm\u0003 could only be observed using high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy.16 The presence of spinodal\ndecomposition in these alloys may cause concern regarding\nwhether they are suitable for practical midinfrared optoelec-\ntronic devices. However, despite the existence of composi-\ntional modulation it is reassuring to note that devices with\nappropriate performance are routinely fabricated from In-\nGaAs and InGaAsP.17,18 The low bulk diffusivity in these\nmetastable alloys renders them stable against any further\nspinodal decomposition.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the LPE growth of\npentanary alloys lattice matched onto GaSb substrates. The\nepitaxial layers have mirrorlike surfaces and exhibit bright\nphotoluminescence.
