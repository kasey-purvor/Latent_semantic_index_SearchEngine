In order to compare the Skyrme model with nuclear physics we have\nto understand the classical solutions and then quantize the model. The classical\nsolutions have a surprisingly rich structure. Configurations in the Skyrme model\nare labelled by a topological winding number which can be interpreted as the\nbaryon number B. Static minimal energy configurations for a given B are known\nas Skyrmions. The B = 1 Skyrmion has spherical symmetry, the B = 2 Skyrmion\nhas axial symmetry and for B > 2 Skyrmions have various discrete symmetries,\nsee [2] and references therein. The Skyrme model depends on a parameter which\ncorresponds to the pion mass mpi. For mpi = 0 all the Skyrmions for B \u2264 22\nwere found to be shell-like configurations with discrete symmetries [2]. Such\nconfigurations are very well described by the rational map ansatz [3]. However,\nif the value of the pion mass is increased to its physical value or higher, then for\nhigh enough baryon number shell-like solutions are no longer the minimal energy\nsolutions [4].\nIn [5, 6] Adkins et al. quantized the translational and rotational zero modes\nof the B = 1 Skyrmion for zero and nonzero pion mass respectively and ob-\ntained good agreement with experiment. A subtle point is that Skyrmions can\nbe quantized as fermions as has been shown in [7]. Solitons in scalar field the-\nories can consistently be quantized as fermions provided that the fundamental\ngroup of configuration space has a Z2 subgroup generated by a loop in which\ntwo identical solitons are exchanged. All loops in configuration space give rise to\nso-called Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints which depend on whether a loop in\nconfiguration space is contractible or not. In particular, symmetries of classical\nconfigurations induce loops in configurations space. After quantization, these\nloops give rise to constraints on the wave function.\nThe B = 2 Skyrmion with axial symmetry was quantized in [8, 9] using\nthe zero mode quantization. Later, the approximation was improved by taking\nmassive modes into account [10]. The B = 3 Skyrmion was first quantized in\n[11] and the B = 4 Skyrmion [12]. Irwin performed a zero mode quantization\nfor B = 4\u2212 9 [13] using the monopole moduli space as an approximation for the\nSkyrmion moduli space. The physical predictions of the Skyrme model for various\nbaryon numbers were also discussed in [14]. Recently, the Finkelstein-Rubinstein\nconstraints have been calculated for Skyrmions which are well-approximated by\nthe rational map ansatz [15], and which we shall call rational map Skyrmions. In\nthis case, the Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints are given by a simple formula.\nThis formula is also valid if the Skyrme configuration can be deformed into a\nrational map Skyrmion while preserving the relevant symmetries. However, this is\nnot always possible. The aim of this paper is to show how to calculate Finkelstein-\nRubinstein constraints for more general configurations.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we first describe the rational\n1\nmap ansatz. Then we discuss the Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints. Finally, we\nderive some constraints on the symmetries which are compatible with a rational\nmap Skyrmion. In section 3 we first introduce a truncated rational map ansatz\nwhich describes well-separated rational map Skyrmions. Then we calculate the\nFinkelstein-Rubinstein constraints for this class of Skyrme configurations. In the\nfollowing section, we describe how to calculate the Finkelstein-Rubinstein con-\nstraints for a minimal energy configuration which is only known numerically. We\nalso give an example. In section 5 we derive constraints on possible symmetries\nin order to make predictions about ground states for Skyrmions with even baryon\nnumber. We end with a conclusion.\n2 Skyrmions and Rational Maps\nIn this section, we first recall the some basic facts about the Skyrme model.\nThen we describe the rational map ansatz. We then discuss how to quantize a\nSkyrmion as a fermion. Finally, we derive which symmetries are compatible with\na rational map Skyrmion of a given baryon number.\n2.1 The rational map ansatz\nThe Skyrme model is a classical field theory of pions. The basic field is the\nSU(2) valued field U(x, t) where x \u2208 R3. The static solutions can be obtained\nby varying the following energy\nE =\n\u222b (\n\u2212\n1\n2\nTr(RiRi)\u2212\n1\n16\nTr([Ri, Rj][Ri, Rj ])\u2212m\n2Tr(U \u2212 1)\n)\nd3x, (1)\nwhere Ri = (\u2202iU)U\n\u2020 is a right invariant su(2) valued current, and m is a parame-\nter proportional to the pion mass mpi, [4]. In order to have finite energy, Skyrme\nfields have to take a constant value, U(|x| =\u221e) = 1, at infinity, and such maps\nare characterized by an integer-valued winding number. This topological charge\nis interpreted as the baryon number and is given by the following integral\nB = \u2212\n1\n24\u03c02\n\u222b\n\u01ebijkTr(RiRjRk)d\n3x. (2)\nWe will denote the configuration space of Skyrmions byQ. Q splits into connected\ncomponents QB labelled by the topological charge. Furthermore, the energy of\nconfigurations in QB is bounded below by E \u2265 12\u03c0\n2B [16].\nThe minimal energy solutions have been calculated in the massless case, m =\n0, for all B \u2264 22 [2]. The solutions are shell-like structures which are very well\napproximated by the rational map ansatz [3] which we will now describe.\nThe main idea is to write Skyrme fields which can be thought of as maps from\nS3 \u2192 S3 in terms of rational maps which are holomorphic maps from S2 \u2192 S2.\n2\nIn algebraic topology, such a construction is known as a suspension. First, we\nintroduce polar coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) and note that the angular coordinates can\nbe related to the complex plane z by the stereographic projection z = ei\u03c6 tan \u03b8\n2\n.\nThen the Skyrme field can be written as\nU(r, z) = exp\n(\nif(r)\n1 + |R|2\n(\n1\u2212 |R|2 2R\u00af\n2R |R|2 \u2212 1\n))\n, (3)\nwhere the profile function f(r) is a real function satisfying the boundary condi-\ntions f(0) = \u03c0 and f(\u221e) = 0. The map R = R(z) is the eponymous rational\nmap. It can be written as the quotient of two polynomials p(z) and q(z) which\nsatisfy max(deg(p(z)), deg(q(z))) = B and p(z) and q(z) have no common fac-\ntors. Here deg denotes the polynomial degree. The ansatz (3) can be inserted\ninto the energy (1) and we obtain\nE = 4\u03c0\n\u222b (\nr2f \u2032\n2\n+ 2B\n(\nf \u2032\n2\n+ 1\n)\nsin2 f + I\nsin4 f\nr2\n+ 2m2r2 (1\u2212 cos f)\n)\ndr, (4)\nwhere\nI =\n1\n4\u03c0\n\u222b (\n1 + |z|2\n1 + |R|2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223dRdz\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n)4\n2i dz dz\u00af\n(1 + |z|2)2\n. (5)\nTo minimize the energy (4) one first determines the rational map which mini-\nmizes I and then calculates the shape function f(r) numerically by solving the\ncorresponding Euler-Lagrange equation. The rational maps which minimize I\nhave been determined numerically in [2, 17] for all B \u2264 40. Note that the re-\nstriction that R(z) is a holomorphic map can be lifted and a generalized rational\nmap ansatz can be introduced [18]. This generalized ansatz has been shown to\nimprove the energy significantly for B \u2264 4, and it also captures the singularity\nstructure of Skyrmions better. However, it is difficult to use for higher baryon\nnumber, and from the point of view of discussing symmetries the original rational\nmap ansatz is sufficient.\nThe rational map ansatz gives a good approximation to the energy of a\nSkyrmion and also gives a very accurate prediction of its symmetry [2]. By sym-\nmetry we mean that a rotation in space followed by a rotation in target space\nleaves the Skyrmion invariant. Namely,\nU(x) = AU (D(A\u2032)x)A\u2020, (6)\nwhere A and A\u2032 are SU(2) matrices and D(A\u2032) is the associated SO(3) rotation.\nIt is therefore important to understand how a rational map transforms under\nrotations in space and target space. It can be shown that\nR(z) 7\u2192 R\u02dc(z) =MA(R(MA\u2032(z))), (7)\nwhere MA and MA\u2032 are Mo\u00a8bius transformations. See [15] for further details.\n3\n2.2 Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints\nIn the following, we recall the ideas of Finkelstein and Rubinstein [7] on how\nto quantized a scalar field theory and obtain fermions. For further details see\n[15, 19]. The main idea is to define a wave function on the covering space of\nconfiguration space. Recall that the configuration space Q of the Skyrme model\nsplits into connected components labelled by the degree B, and will be denoted\nby QB. The fundamental group of each component of the configuration space Q\nis \u03c01(QB) = Z2. Therefore, the covering space Q\u02dcB of each component is a double\ncover. In order to have fermionic quantisation we have to impose the condition\nthat if two different points p1, p2 \u2208 Q\u02dcB correspond to the same point p \u2208 QB\nthen the wave function \u03c8 : Q\u02dcB \u2192 C has to satisfy\n\u03c8(p1) = \u2212\u03c8(p2). (8)\nThe points p1, p2 \u2208 Q\u02dcB can be interpreted as two paths in configuration space.\nThe condition that p1 6= p2 implies that p1 and p2 differ by a noncontractible loop.\nEvery symmetry of a classical configuration gives rise to a loop in configuration\nspace. In particular, we are interested in symmetries given by a rotation by \u03b1\nin space followed by a rotation by \u03b2 in target space. This leads to the following\nconstraint on the wave function \u03c8:\nexp\n(\ni\u03b1n \u00b7 J\u02c6\n)\nexp\n(\ni\u03b2N \u00b7 I\u02c6\n)\n\u03c8 = \u03c7FR\u03c8, (9)\nwhere n is the direction of the rotation axis in space, N is the rotation axis\nin target space, a J\u02c6 and I\u02c6 are the angular momentum operators in space and\ntarget space, respectively.1 Note that rotations in target space will also be called\nisorotations. The Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase \u03c7FR enforces the condition (8)\nand satisfies\n\u03c7FR =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n1 if the induced loop is contractible,\n\u22121 otherwise.\n(10)\nHere is a good place to summarize some important and well-known results.\nGiulini showed that a 2\u03c0 rotation of a Skyrmion gives rise to \u03c7FR = (\u22121) if\nand only if the baryon number B is odd, [20]. Finkelstein and Rubinstein showed\nin [7] that a 2\u03c0 rotation of a Skyrmion of degree B is homotopic to an exchange\nof two Skyrmions of degree B. This also implies that an exchange of two iden-\ntical Skyrmions gives rise to \u03c7FR = (\u22121) if and only if their baryon number B\nis odd. In [15] it was shown that a 2\u03c0 isorotation of a Skyrmion also gives rise\nto \u03c7FR = (\u22121) if and only if the baryon number B is odd. These results agree\nwith the physical intuition since atomic nuclei can be modelled by interacting\npoint-like fermionic particles.\n1For a more detailed discussion on body fixed and space fixed angular momentum operators\nin this context see [19].\n4\n2.3 Symmetries of rational maps\nShell-like Skyrmions are described very well using the rational map ansatz. If a\nrational map Skyrmion of degree B is symmetric under a rotation by \u03b1 followed\nby an isorotation by \u03b2 then the Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase of this symmetry\nis given by\n\u03c7FR = (\u22121)\nN where N = B (B\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2) \/(2\u03c0), (11)\nwhich has been proven in [15]. For B > 2 all the known Skyrmions are invariant\nunder discrete subgroups, so they contain cyclic groups as subgroups. Let Ckn be\na cyclic group of order n which is generated by a rotation by \u03b1 = 2\u03c0\/n followed\nby an isorotation by \u03b2 = 2\u03c0k\/n where \u2212n < k \u2264 n. Equation (11) imposes a\nconstraint on the values of B which are compatible with a given Ckn symmetry.\nNamely, N has to be an integer. A stronger constraint can be derived if we work\ndirectly with rational maps.\nLemma 2.1 A rational map of degree B can have a Ckn symmetry if and only if\nB \u2261 0 mod n or B \u2261 k mod n.\nProof:\nWithout loss of generality consider rational maps with boundary conditionR(\u221e) =\n\u221e and assume that the Ckn symmetry corresponds to a rotation around the third\naxis in space followed by a rotation around the negative third axis in target space.\nWith this choice of axes, the boundary conditions are preserved by the relevant\nrotation and also by the relevant isorotation, and the sign choice corresponds to\nthe sign choice for (11) in [15]. The rational map R(z) = p(z)\/q(z) can be written\nas\nR(z) =\nzB + aB\u22121z\nB\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ a0\nbB\u22121zB\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ b0\n(12)\nwhere the polynomials p(z) and q(z) have no common factors. The Ckn symmetry\ncondition is given by\nR(z) = e\u22122piki\/nR(e2pii\/nz). (13)\nNote that a Cn\u2212kn rotation can be interpreted as a C\n\u2212k\nn rotation followed by a 2\u03c0\nisorotation. Since for a 2\u03c0 isorotation the Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase is simply\ngiven by \u03c7FR = (\u22121)\nB, we can restrict our attention to k = 0, . . . , n\u2212 1.\nFirst we show existence. Let B \u2261 k mod n, so B = nl+k. Then the rational\nmap\nR(z) =\nzkr(zn)\ns(zn)\n(14)\nwhere r(z) is a polynomial of degree l and s(z) is a polynomial of at most degree l.\nFor k = 0 the degree of s(z) has to be less than l in order to respect the boundary\nconditions R(\u221e) = \u221e. This rational map is invariant under Ckn. To make sure\n5\nthat it is a rational map of degree B = nl + k the polynomials r(zn) and s(zn)\nare required not to have any common factors. Furthermore, for k 6= 0, we need\nto impose s(0) 6= 0, since the polynomial p(z) has a zero at z = 0. For k = 0, we\nalso impose the condition s(0) 6= 0, and we will discuss the case s(0) = 0 in the\nnext paragraph. The simplest example of such a rational map is\nR(z) = zB . (15)\nHence a rational map of degree B with Ckn symmetry exists for B \u2261 k mod n.\nSimilarly, let B \u2261 0 mod n, so B = nl. Again, we only consider k =\n0, . . . , n\u2212 1. Then the rational map\nR(z) =\nr(zn)\nzn\u2212ks(zn)\n, (16)\nis invariant under Ckn. Here r(z) is again a polynomial of degree l and s(z) is\na polynomial of at most degree l \u2212 1 which has no common factors with r(z).\nFurthermore, we also require r(0) 6= 0. One example of such a rational map is\nR(z) =\nzB + 1\nzn\u2212k\n. (17)\nHence a rational map of degree B with Ckn symmetry exists for B \u2261 0 mod n.\nThis completes the proof of existence. The classification of rational maps into\ntype (14) and type (16) will become useful in section 5.\nNow, we assume that the rational map (12) is invariant under Ckn. In ho-\nmogeneous coordinates, the rational map R(z) is given by [p(z), q(z)] \u2208 CP 1\nsubject to the relation that [p(z), q(z)] = [\u03bbp(z), \u03bbq(z)] for any complex number\n\u03bb 6= 0. Under the symmetry Ckn, the polynomials p(z) and q(z) in equation (12)\ntransform as\np(z) 7\u2192 \u03bbe\u22122piik\/np(e2pii\/nz),\nq(z) 7\u2192 \u03bbq(e2pii\/nz),\n(18)\nfor \u03bb 6= 0. Assuming the rational map is invariant under Ckn leads to the following\nconstraints on the coefficients.\nam = \u03bbe\n2pii(m\u2212k)\/nam,\nbm = \u03bbe\n2piim\/nbm.\n(19)\nIn order to have a rational map of degree B, p(z) and q(z) cannot have any\ncommon factors. This implies that a0 and b0 cannot both be zero. First, assume\na0 6= 0. Then equation (19) implies that\n\u03bb = e2piik\/n. (20)\nThe coefficient of the highest power in the numerator is also not allowed to vanish\nwhich implies\ne2piiB\/n = 1, (21)\n6\nso that B \u2261 0 mod n. Now, consider that b0 6= 0 which implies\n\u03bb = 1. (22)\nAgain, the coefficient of the highest power in the numerator is not allowed to\nvanish. Therefore,\ne2pii(B\u2212k)\/n = 1, (23)\nso that B \u2261 k mod n, which completes the proof. \u0003\nThe lemma is more restrictive than the condition that N is an integer. For\nexample B(B\u2212k) \u2261 0 mod n suggests that a C04 symmetry is possible for B = 2.\nHowever, since B \u2261 2 mod 4 our lemma excludes such a symmetry.\n3 A truncated rational map ansatz\nIn [15] the Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints were calculated for Skyrmions which\nare well approximated by the rational map ansatz. In this section, we calculate\nthe Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints for Skyrme configurations U(x) which are\ngiven by a truncated rational map ansatz defined as follows. Let UBi(x) be a\nSkyrme configuration of degree Bi which is given by (3) and the shape function\nf(r) is a smooth, decreasing function which satisfies f(0) = \u03c0 and f(r) = 0 for\nr \u2265 L. Then the Skyrme configuration is given by\nU(x) =\n{\nUBi(x\u2212Xi) for |x\u2212Xi| < L,\n1 otherwise.\n(24)\nFrom formula (2) it is obvious that the configuration U(x) has the degree B =\u2211\ni\nBi. The parameters Xi are the positions of the Skyrmions, and we assume that\n|Xi\u2212Xj | > 2L for i 6= j. Such an ansatz provides reasonable initial conditions for\nnumerical simulations [21]. A related ansatz is the product ansatz. This ansatz\nproduces Skyrme configurations which are closer in energy to the true solutions.\nTopologically, these two ansa\u00a8tze are equivalent. However, the product ansatz\nhas the disadvantage that it is non-commutative, since in general U1U2 6= U2U1\nfor SU(2) matrices U1 and U2, so that it is slightly more difficult to discuss\nsymmetries. Therefore, we restrict our attention to the truncated rational map\nansatz.\nConsider a configuration U(x) which is invariant under Ckn. The symmetry\nrelates different Skyrmions UBi with each other. For each individual Skyrmion\nUBi there are two possibilities. Either the centre of this Skyrmion lies on the\nsymmetry axis or it is one constituent of a regular n-gon of Skyrmions which\ntransform into each other under the symmetry.\n7\n3.1 Skyrmions centred on the symmetry axis\nAssume two Skyrmions with baryon number B1 and B2 have a common C\nk\nn axis\nof symmetry, say the x3 axis, and are centred around the origin and the point\nP = (0, 0, c) for c > L. Then the symmetry loop is homotopic to a product of\ntwo loops, each acting only on one Skyrmion. This can be seen as follows. The\nconfiguration can be written as\nU(x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nU1(x) for |x| < L,\nU2(x) for |x\u2212 (0, 0, c)| < L,\n1 otherwise.\n(25)\nUnder a rotation, the configuration transforms as\nA(\u03b2)U(D(\u03b1)x)A\u2020(\u03b2) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nA(\u03b2)U1(D(\u03b1)x)A\n\u2020(\u03b2) for |x| < L,\nA(\u03b2)U2(D(\u03b1)x)A\n\u2020(\u03b2) for |x\u2212 (0, 0, c)| < L,\n1 otherwise.\n(26)\nHere A(\u03b2) is a rotation in target space acting by conjugation and D(\u03b1) is a\nrotation around the x3 axis. Note in particular, that the vacuum is invariant\nunder isorotation. The map H : [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 QB : (s, t) 7\u2192 H(s, t) provides\na homotopy such that H(0, t) is a Ckn rotation of the whole configuration while\nH(1, t) corresponds to a loop which first rotates one Skyrmion and then the other.\nH(s, t) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nA(h1(s, t)\u03b2)U1(D(h1(s, t)\u03b1)x)A\n\u2020(h1(s, t)\u03b2) for |x| < L,\nA(h2(s, t)\u03b2)U2(D(h2(s, t)\u03b1)x)A\n\u2020(h2(s, t)\u03b2) for |x\u2212 (0, 0, c)| < L,\n1 otherwise,\n(27)\nwhere\nh1(s, t) =\n{\nt\/(1\u2212 s\/2) for 0 \u2264 t < 1\u2212 s\/2,\n1 for s \u2264 t \u2264 1,\n(28)\nand similarly\nh2(s, t) =\n{\n0 for 0 \u2264 t < s\/2,\n(t\u2212 s\/2)\/(1\u2212 s\/2) for s\/2 \u2264 t \u2264 1.\n(29)\nTherefore, the Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase can be calculated as a product of\nthe two loops of the individual Skyrmions. Since we are assuming that the B1\nand the B2 Skyrmion are both well-described by the rational map ansatz we can\napply formula (11) and obtain \u03c7FR = (\u22121)\nN where\nN = B1(B1\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2)\/(2\u03c0) +B2(B2\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2)\/(2\u03c0),\n= (B21 +B\n2\n2)\u03b1\/(2\u03c0)\u2212 (B1 +B2)\u03b2\/(2\u03c0). (30)\n8\nNaive application of formula (11) gives an incorrect result, namely \u03c7FR = (\u22121)\nN\u02dc\nwhere\nN\u02dc = (B1 +B2)\n2\u03b1\/(2\u03c0)\u2212 (B1 +B2)\u03b2\/(2\u03c0). (31)\nThis N\u02dc is no longer well defined. Let B1 = 1 and B2 = 1 be invariant under a\nC13 rotation. Then N = 0, but N\u02dc = 2\/3. Also, consider B1 = 1 and B2 = 1 with\nsymmetry C12 then N = 0, but N\u02dc = 1.\nIn this context, it is worth mentioning another interesting ansatz for Skyrmions,\nnamely, the multi-shell ansatz by Manton and Piette [22]. The main idea is to\nconstruct multiple concentric shells of Skyrmions, where each shell is given by\nthe usual rational map ansatz. The multi-shell ansatz can then be written as\nU(x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nexp (if(r)nR1 \u00b7 \u03c4 ) for 2\u03c0 \u2265 f(r) > \u03c0,\nexp (if(r)nR2 \u00b7 \u03c4 ) for \u03c0 \u2265 f(r) > 0,\n(32)\nwhere f(r) is a monotonically decreasing function with boundary conditions\nf(0) = 2\u03c0 and f(\u221e) = 0. Here R1 and R2 are two rational maps of degree B1\nand B2, respectively. The degree of such a Skyrme configuration is B = B1 +B2.\nNote that for f(r0) = \u03c0 the Skyrme field takes the value U(r0) = \u22121 which is\ninvariant under rotations and isorotations. As before, we can split a symmetry\nloop into two loops, each of which only acting on the inner or the outer Skyrmion,\nsimilar to (27). Therefore, formula (30) is also valid in this case.\n3.2 Configurations of n Skyrmions related by symmetry\nLemma 3.1 For n Skyrmions of degree B which are related by a Ckn symmetry\nthe Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase is \u03c7FR = (\u22121)\nN where\nN = B (nB \u2212 k) . (33)\nProof:\nThe relevant Skyrme configuration corresponds to a regular n-gon of Skyrmions.\nThe loop L which is induced by the Ckn symmetry has two effects on this con-\nfiguration. Each Skyrmion is rotated and isorotated by Ckn. Furthermore, the\nSkyrmions are exchanged via the permutation (12 . . . n), keeping the orientation\nin space and target space fixed. Therefore, the loop L can be divided into n\nrotation and isorotation loops for each Skyrmion and a permutation loop, which\nin turn can be split up into n \u2212 1 exchanges of two Skyrmions. The individual\nSkyrmions are given by rational maps so we can apply formula (11) for each\nrotation and isorotation. Furthermore, Finkelstein and Rubinstein have shown\nthat an exchange of two Skyrmions of degree B is homotopic to a 2\u03c0 rotation of\na Skyrmion of degree B and we can again apply formula (11). Note that N in\n9\nformula (11) is only well-defined modulo 2. The Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase for\nthe loop L is then given by\n\u03c7FR = (\u03c7FR(rotation\/isorotation))\nn (\u03c7FR(single exchange))\nn\u22121 . (34)\nUsing (11) this gives rise to\nN = nB (B\/n\u2212 k\/n) + (n\u2212 1)B2, (35)\n= nB2 \u2212 Bk, (36)\nwhich completes the proof. \u0003\nA more heuristic way of understanding the result of lemma 3.1 is the following.\nConsider a regular n-gon of Skyrmions of degree B which transform into each\nother under a Ckn symmetry. Intuitively, this configuration can be deformed into\na torus of degree nB under a homotopy which preserves the Ckn symmetry. Then\nthe Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase can be calculated with formula (11) and we\nobtain\n\u03c7FR = (\u22121)\nB(nB\u2212k), (37)\nas above.\n3.3 General configurations\nGiven a general configuration in the truncated rational map ansatz, which is sym-\nmetric under Ckn, we split up the configuration into regular n-gons of Skyrmions\nwhich transform into each other and Skyrmions which are on the symmetry axes.\nAssume that there are l regular n-gons of Skyrmions with degree Bi for i = 1, . . . , l\nand m Skyrmions of degree B\u02dci for i = 1, . . . , m which are located on the symme-\ntry axis. Then the Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase for this symmetry is given by\n\u03c7FR = (\u22121)\nN where N =\nl\u2211\ni=1\nBi (nBi \u2212 k) +\nm\u2211\ni=1\nB\u02dci\n(\nB\u02dci \u2212 k\n)\n\/n. (38)\nThis formula follows by constructing a homotopy between the Ckn symmetry loop\nand a product of loops for the individual groups of Skyrmions as in section 3.1.\n4 How to calculate Finkelstein-Rubinstein con-\nstraints from numerical configurations\nIn this section, we describe how to calculate the Finkelstein-Rubinstein con-\nstraints for a Skyrme configuration which is only known numerically.\n1. Calculate the minimal energy configuration and analyze its symmetry prop-\nerties.\n10\n2. Confirm the symmetry by starting with a symmetric configuration as initial\ncondition and relaxing to the same final configuration.2\n3. For each generator of the symmetry group identify k for Ckn.\n4. Approximate the Skyrmion by a truncated rational map ansatz with the\nright symmetries.\n5. Calculate the Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints using formula (38).\nFigure 1: The B = 32 cube\nIn the following, we calculate the Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints for the\nB = 32 cube, which is displayed in figure 1. This configuration is one of the first\nexamples of a Skyrmion which cannot be described with the rational map ansatz\n[4]. The configuration has been calculated numerically in [4] (step 1). It can be\napproximated by a chunk of the Skyrmion crystal [23] and has cubic symmetry.\nStarting with a chunk of the crystal as initial conditions imposes the symmetries\nand corresponds to step 2. Step 3 is comparatively easy in this example since we\nhave an analytic ansatz for the initial condition. The cubic symmetry is generated\nby a C3 and a C4 symmetry. The Skyrme field can be parametrized as \u03c3 + i\u03c4j\u03c0j\nwhere \u03c4i are the Pauli matrices. With the choice of fields as in [4] the symmetries\nare\nC3 : (\u03c3, \u03c01, \u03c02, \u03c03) 7\u2192 (\u03c3, \u03c03, \u03c01, \u03c02),\nC4 : (\u03c3, \u03c01, \u03c02, \u03c03) 7\u2192 (\u03c3,\n\u22122pi1+pi2\u22122pi3\n3\n, pi1\u22122pi2\u22122pi3\n3\n, \u22122pi1\u22122pi2+pi3\n3\n).\nSo, the cubic symmetry is generated by C13 and C\n2\n4 . The B = 32 Skyrmion can\nbe thought of as eight B = 4 cubes. Under the C24 symmetry the top four cubes\ntransform into each other and the bottom four cubes transform into each other\n2This provides a homotopy from the initial condition to the final configuration which is\ninvariant under the symmetry.\n11\n(step 4). So, we can use formula (38) with Bi = 4 and l = 2, n = 4 and k = 2\n(step 5). There are no Skyrmions on the symmetry axis, B\u02dci = 0.\nN = 2 \u2217 4 \u2217 (4 \u2217 4\u2212 2),\n= 112.\nTherefore, the Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase \u03c7FR = 1 for this symmetry. Under\nthe C13 symmetry, two B = 4 Skyrmions are on the rotation axes and there are\ntwo groups of three B = 4 Skyrmions which transform into each other. Therefore,\nBi = 4, l = 2, n = 3, k = 1, B\u02dc = 4 and m = 2. So, formula (38) gives\nN = 2 \u2217 4 \u2217 (4 \u2217 3\u2212 1) + 2 \u2217 4 \u2217 (4\u2212 1)\/3,\n= 96.\nTherefore, the Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase is again trivial. In the following\nsection, we show that we can derive some results from general principles, so that\nwe only have to carry through steps 1 \u2013 5 for a very small subset of all the possible\nsymmetries.\n5 Symmetries and Finkelstein-Rubinstein con-\nstraints for even B\nIn this section we collect a set of general results about symmetries and Finkelstein-\nRubinstein constraints. We start with the following lemma.\nLemma 5.1 Negative Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints cannot occur for Ck2l+1\nfor l \u2265 1 if B is even.\nProof: Applying a Ckn symmetry n times corresponds to a 2\u03c0 rotation in space\nfollowed by a 2\u03c0k rotation in target space. If B is even, then a 2\u03c0 rotation (and\nalso a 2\u03c0 isorotation) is homotopic to the trivial loop in the Skyrme configuration\nspace. In this case, the Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints correspond to one-\ndimensional and hence irreducible representations of Ckn which are obtained by\nmapping the generator of Ckn to (\u22121)\nN . This representation can be thought of\nas a homomorphism from Ckn \u2192 Z2 and therefore can only be nontrivial if n is\neven. \u0003\nIn the following, we address the question of which symmetries can lead to\nnegative Finkelstein-Rubinstein phases. Lemma 5.1 greatly simplifies the discus-\nsion, so we only consider even baryon number B. Furthermore, we restrict our\nattention to the symmetries which have been found empirically [2]. These are\ncyclic symmetry C2, dihedral symmetry Dn for n \u2264 6, the tetrahedral group T ,\nthe octahedral group O and the icosahedral group Y . Therefore, we first discuss\n12\nthe cyclic subgroups Ckn for n \u2264 6. For even baryon number B the following\npicture emerges for Skyrmions which are well-approximated by rational maps.\nUsing formula (11) and lemma 5.1 the cyclic groups Ckn can be grouped into\nthree groups:\n1. The following symmetries never lead to negative \u03c7FR, if B \u2261 0 mod 2:\nC02 , C\nk\n3 , C\n2\n4 , C\nk\n5 , C\n2k\n6 .\n2. The following symmetries give rise to negative \u03c7FR if B \u2261 2 mod 4:\nC12 , C\n0\n4 , C\n2k+1\n6 .\n3. The following symmetries give rise to negative \u03c7FR if B \u2261 4 mod 8:\nC14 , C\n3\n4 .\nIn order to understand Dn symmetry we need to examine under which con-\nditions can there be an additional C2 symmetry for a given realization of a C\nk\nn\nsymmetry? Since 2\u03c0 isorotations are always a symmetry we can restrict our at-\ntention to j = 0 and j = 1. The two different realizations of a Ckn symmetry can\nbe characterized by their zeros and poles at zero and infinity. A rational map of\ntype (14) has a zero of multiplicity k mod n at z = 0 and a pole of multiplicity\nk mod n at z =\u221e. A rational map of type (16) has a pole of multiplicity n\u2212 k\nmod n at z = 0, and a pole of order k mod n at z =\u221e.\nFor our purpose, it is sufficient to discuss the case that the C2 rotation axis\nis orthogonal to the Ckn rotation axis. This generates the group Dn. For a C\n1\n2\nsymmetry it is important whether the C12 isorotation axis is parallel to the C\nk\nn\nisorotation or orthogonal to it, and we will introduce the notation (C12 )\u2016 and\n(C12)\u22a5. For C\n0\n2 such a distinction is not necessary. A C2 symmetry around an\naxis orthogonal to the Ckn symmetry axis maps z = 0 to z =\u221e. In target space,\nR = 0 is mapped to R =\u221e if the C12 axis is orthogonal to the C\nk\nn axis in target\nspace, namely for (C12)\u22a5, but R = 0 and R = \u221e are invariant for (C\n1\n2 )\u2016 and\nfor C02 . The numbers of zeros and poles imply that a rational map of type (14)\ncannot have an additional symmetry of type C02 or (C\n1\n2)\u2016. However, a (C\n1\n2)\u22a5\nsymmetry is possible for all values of k. A rational map of type (16) can only\nhave an additional C02 or (C\n1\n2)\u2016 symmetry if n \u2212 k \u2261 k mod n. An additional\n(C12)\u22a5 symmetry is never allowed.\nNow, we can apply the above result to the case B \u2261 0 mod 4. The above\nlist shows that a negative Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase is only possible for C14\nand C34 symmetry. A C\nk\n4 symmetry empirically only occurs as a subgroup of a\nD4 symmetry which itself might be a subgroup of the cubic group O. For B \u2261 0\nmod 4 the corresponding rational map can be of type (14). Then an additional\nC2 symmetry is only possible for 4 \u2212 k \u2261 k mod 4 which excludes k = 1 and\nk = 3. The rational map can also be of type (16) provided that k \u2261 0 mod 4.\nTherefore, D4 symmetry is not compatible with C\n1\n4 and C\n3\n4 so that no negative\nFinkelstein-Rubinstein constraints can occur for B \u2261 0 mod 4.\n13\nB symmetry type \u03c7FR\n6 D4 (14) (\u22121)\n10 D4 (14) (\u22121)\n10\u2217 D3 (14) (\u22121)\n14 D2 (14) or (16) (\u22121)\n18 D2 (14) or (16) (\u22121)\n22 D5 (14) (\u22121)\n22\u2217 D3 (14) (\u22121)\nTable 1: Symmetry, type and Finkelstein-Rubinstein phase for baryon number\nB \u2261 2 mod 4.\nNow, we discuss the case B \u2261 2 mod 4. Negative \u03c7FR can occur for C\n1\n2 ,\nC04 and C\n2k+1\n6 . C\n1\n2 can occur as subgroup of Dn, T , O and Y . From the point\nof view of Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints only the D2 subgroup of T and Y\ncontributes and similarly, only the D4 subgroup of O contributes. Rational maps\nof type (14) always allow a (C12)\u22a5 symmetry which leads to \u03c7FR = \u22121. For\nrational maps of type (16), the C2 symmetry is either C\n0\n2 or (C\n1\n2 )\u2016, and only\nthe latter leads to negative \u03c7FR. Note however, that a D2 symmetry of type\n(16) is only possible if k \u2261 1 mod 2, so that a D2 symmetry always leads to\nnegative \u03c7FR. In [15], the symmetries and Finkelstein-Rubinstein phases have\nbeen discussed for B \u2264 22. The results for B \u2261 2 mod 4 are displayed in table\n1. Note that type (16) can only occur if B \u2261 0 mod n for the maximal Cn\nsubgroup. All symmetries are either D2 or are of type (14), so that for B \u2261 2\nmod 4 only symmetries with negative Finkelstein-Rubinstein phases have been\nobserved. However, from symmetry arguments alone, it is not possible to exclude\nthat the symmetries act in such a way that all the phases are positive.\n5.1 Physical interpretation of the symmetry calculations\nThe physical interpretation of this result is as follows. In nuclear physics we are\ninterested in the quantum ground states for a given number of nucleons. In our\nsemi-classical approximations the ground state is given by the lowest values of\nthe angular momentum quantum numbers J and I which are compatible with\nthe symmetries of the classical configurations. In particular, the wave function\n\u03c8 has to satisfy the symmetry condition (9) for all classical symmetries of the\ngiven Skyrmion. We decompose the wave function \u03c8 in angular momentum\neigenfunction and write \u03c8 = |J\u3009|I\u3009 for a wave function with angular momentum\n14\nquantum numbers J and I.\nParticularly interesting is the even-even situation when there is an even num-\nber of protons and an even number of neutrons. For small nuclei the number of\nprotons and neutrons are equal, so that even-even nuclei have B \u2261 0 mod 4. In\nthis case, experiment shows that the ground state is generally given by |0\u3009|0\u3009.\nThis is only possible if the Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints are trivial. The\nabove discussion showed that the |0\u3009|0\u3009 ground state is allowed for B \u2261 0 mod 4,\nin agreement with experiment. In this calculation we assumed that the relevant\nSkyrmions are well-approximated by rational maps, and that C4 symmetry only\noccurs as a subgroup of a D4 symmetry (which might itself be a subgroup of an\noctahedral symmetry).\nFor higher pion mass the configurations deviate significantly from the ratio-\nnal map ansatz [21], which raises the question whether it is possible to classify\nsymmetries allowing for the more general truncated rational map ansatz. The\nSkyrmions would be allowed to split into groups and the Finkelstein-Rubinstein\nconstraints have to be calculated with formula (38). Note that if Skyrmions\ncan be thought of as being composed only of B = 4 Skyrmions (\u03b1 particles) then\nformula (38) and the above symmetry discussion also imply that there are no neg-\native Finkelstein-Rubinstein phases, so that the ground state for such Skyrmions\nis |0\u3009|0\u3009.\nFor odd-odd nuclei, which implies B \u2261 2 mod 4 for equal number of pro-\ntons and neutrons, experiment shows that the ground state is usually not given\nby |0\u3009|0\u3009. This is consistent with our observation that negative Finkelstein-\nRubinstein phases occur. However, symmetry arguments alone are not suffi-\ncient to prove the occurrence of negative Finkelstein-Rubinstein phases. For odd\nbaryon number, lemma 5.1 cannot be applied and there is little hope of finding\nsimple rules.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper we discussed how to calculate Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints for\nconfigurations which are only known numerically. This is an important problem\nsince recent calculations show that for large pion mass Skyrmions are not very\nwell described by rational maps [21]. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that\nthe pion mass in the Skyrme model should be interpreted as an effective mass with\na value at least twice the physical value [24]. The calculation of the Finkelstein-\nRubinstein constraints can be incorporated into the algorithm for finding the\nminimal energy configurations with only minor modifications.\nNote that for a wide range of values of the pion mass, the rational map\nansatz works well for small enough baryon number B. Therefore, the truncated\nrational map ansatz in its current form has a good chance of capturing all the\nphysically relevant Skyrmions. An obvious but slightly tedious generalisation\n15\nwould be to allow for the constituent Skyrmions to be themselves approximated\nby a truncated rational map ansatz.\nThe paper also discussed which symmetries occur for rational map Skyrmions\nand when to expect negative Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints for even baryon\nnumbers. In particular, the Skyrme model calculations suggest the correct phe-\nnomenological trend, namely that the ground state of even-even nuclei have the\nground state |0\u3009|0\u3009.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank N.
