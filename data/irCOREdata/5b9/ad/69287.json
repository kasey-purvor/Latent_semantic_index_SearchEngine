We studied litter decomposition over a 10-mo period in a seasonally dry Amazon forest in Mato Grosso, Brazil.

We measured understorey density, litter depth, canopy openness, temperature and relative humidity in the plots. Decomposition experiments took place using 720 litterbags filled with approximately 10 g of natural abscised oven-dried leaves.

Litterbags were collected and reweighed 2, 4, 6 and 8 mo after being placed on the forest floor. All forest structure variables were significantly different across plots: BF3 was hotter, less humid, had the highest degree of canopy openness, lowest understorey density and the shallowest litter depth. Litter decomposition (mass loss) was similar in the once-burned and unburned plots, but declined more slowly in BF3. In addition, decomposition was slower in fine-mesh litterbags than coarse-mesh litterbags in BF3, but there was no difference between mesh sizes in BF1 and UF. It is likely that changes in forest structure and microclimate explain the lower decomposition rates in BF3.

We studied litter decomposition over a 10-mo period in a seasonally dry Amazon\nforest inMato Grosso, Brazil. The study plots (50 ha each) included unburned forest (UF), once-burned (BF1) and forest\nburned annually for 3 y (BF3). We measured understorey density, litter depth, canopy openness, temperature and\nrelative humidity in the plots. Decomposition experiments took place using 720 litterbags filled with approximately\n10 g of natural abscised oven-dried leaves. To test the effects of fire on soil meso- and macrofauna, the litterbags had\neither a fine (2 mm) or coarse (with 1-cm holes in side) mesh size. Litterbags were collected and reweighed 2, 4, 6 and\n8 mo after being placed on the forest floor. All forest structure variables were significantly different across plots: BF3\nwas hotter, less humid, had the highest degree of canopy openness, lowest understorey density and the shallowest litter\ndepth. Litter decomposition (mass loss)was similar in the once-burned andunburned plots, but declinedmore slowly in\nBF3. In addition, decomposition was slower in fine-mesh litterbags than coarse-mesh litterbags in BF3, but there was\nno difference between mesh sizes in BF1 and UF. It is likely that changes in forest structure and microclimate explain\nthe lower decomposition rates in BF3. These results show the importance of recurrent fires, but suggest that single\nunderstorey fires may not have long-term negative effects on some ecological processes in seasonally dry Amazonian\nforests.\nKey Words:Amazon, arthropods, Brazil, decomposition, fire, organic matter\nINTRODUCTION\nThe nutrient cycle is a vital component of ecosystem\nfunctioning and decomposition is an important step\n(Aber & Melillo 1991), contributing to the formation\nand fertility of soils and forming the base of various\nfood webs in tropical forests (Fittkau & Klinge 1973).\nThe transformation of the organic matter is especially\nimportant in tropical forests with infertile soils, where\na large proportion of the nutrients are locked up in\nleaves (Aber &Melillo 1991). These nutrients are quickly\nmineralized and absorbed by the roots, especially in the\nrainy season (Sanderman & Amundson 2005).\nDecomposition is known to be influenced by five\nintercorrelated factors: climate, soil fertility, organic\n1 Corresponding author.

All of these can be affected by\ndisturbance, yet relatively few studies have examined\nthe effects of forest disturbance on decomposition in\nthe humid tropics. The existing studies suggest that\nheavily impacted areas, such as sites with no vegetation,\npasture and small fragments, show slower decomposition\nrates compared to a primary forest (Kumar & Deepu\n1992, Mesquita et al. 1998). However, secondary\nforests in advanced stages of succession show similar\ndecompositionrates toprimary forests (Barlow etal.2007,\nXuluc-Tolosa et al. 2003). These studies also reveal a\nmarked geographic bias. For example, studies within the\nBrazilian Amazon are concentrated in forest fragments\nnear Manaus, Amazonas (Didham 1998, Mesquita et al.\n1998, Rubinstein & Vasconcelos 2005, Vasconcelos &\nLaurance 2005).\n658 JULIANAM. SILVEIRA ET AL.\nAccidental fires have become increasingly frequent in\nAmazonian forest over the past two decades, especially\nat agricultural frontiers and in severe dry seasons\ninfluenced by global climate changes (Alencar et al.\n2006). Burning can have an impact on post-fire\ndecomposition by changing forest structure, leading\nto higher temperatures, lower humidity (Cochrane &\nSchulze 1999, Nepstad et al. 1999, Uhl & Kauffman\n1990) and changes in soil proprieties (Schlesinger\n1997), all of which act directly on organisms involved\nin decomposition (Sanderman & Amundson 2005).\nFurthermore, even low-intensity fires destroy the leaf-\nlitter and soil fauna that live within it (Silveira 2008).\nBecause the soil fauna actively contributes towards\ndecomposition (Cou\u02c6teaux et al. 1995, Dickinson &\nPugh 1974) it seems likely that fire could also alter\ndecomposition rates by changing faunal populations.\nHowever, just one study has examined the impact of\nwildfires on decomposition in tropical forests, and this\nwas carried out a long (and unspecified) time after the\nfires occurred, and did not explicitly consider the role of\nsoil fauna in decomposition (Chaco\u00b4n & Dezzeo 2007).\nSoil faunacanbeclassifiedon thebasisof bodysize,with\nmesofaunabeingorganismswithabodywidthof<2mm,\nand macrofauna being organisms with a body width> 2\nmm. Mesofauna affect decomposition rates by grazing on\nbacteria, fungi and soil animals, and consuming litter and\nexcreting pellets. Macrofauna transform litter in a similar\nway, but also physically mix soil organic matter with\nthe mineral horizon (Cou\u02c6teaux et al. 1995, Dickinson &\nPugh1974,Wardle 2002). The interaction betweenboth\ngroups can further affect decomposition rates (Bradford\net al. 2002, Heneghan et al. 1999, Seta\u00a8la\u00a8 et al. 1996,\nSulkava & Huhta 1998).\nThis study aims to provide data on decomposition rates\n(%mass loss) and the importance of the leaf-litter fauna in\ntwo different experimental fire regimes in a seasonally dry\nforest in the south of the Brazilian Amazon. Treatments\nincluded unburned forest (UF), once-burned (BF1) and\nforest burned annually for three years (BF3). We test the\nhypotheses that (1) decomposition is slower in burned\nforests and (2) decomposition is slowerwhenmacrofauna\nare excluded from the litterbags.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy site\nThe study was carried out at Fazenda Tanguro\n(13\u25e64\u203235.39\u2032\u2032S;52\u25e623\u20328.85\u2032\u2032W)in150-haofAmazonian\nforest in the municipality of Querencia in the state of\nMato Grosso, Brazil, 30 km north of the forest-cerrado\n(Brazilian savanna) boundaries. The vegetation in the\nstudy site consists of a closed-canopy forest, with tree\nheight reaching 18\u201320 m, with a few taller emergents\n(Balch et al. 2008, Ivanauskas et al. 2003). Vegetation in\nthese forests is lower indiversity thanmorehumid tropical\nforests (Balch et al. 2008). Oxisols are predominant,\nwith high Al content and low fertility (Radam Brasil\n1974). Climate is humid tropical, type Aw according to\nKo\u00a8eppen\u2019s classification (Radam Brasil 1974). Average\nannual rainfall is c. 1500 mm. There is a marked dry\nseason from May to September, where rainfall often falls\nbelow 10mmmo\u22121 (Balch et al. 2008).\nThe 150-ha site was divided into three 50-ha plots in\n2004, composed of unburned forest (UF), once-burned\n(BF1), and forest burned annually for 3 y (BF3). Trails\nwere cut every 50m in N\u2013S directions, andmarked every\n50 m in E\u2013W directions in the three plots, creating a\ngrid that was used for data collection. All experimental\nburns took place at the end of the dry season (August\u2013\nSeptember). Duringall years, fireswere set usingkerosene\ndrip torches along the N\u2013S trails. A total of 10 km of fire-\nlines were set per plot during 3\u20134 consecutive days from\n9h00 to 16h00. These fires often smouldered or went\nout during the humid nights, and were therefore relit the\nfollowing day. Fires typically burned leaf litter and fallen\ntwigs and branches, but not the standing trees (see Balch\net al. 2008 for more details).\nThis study was conducted from December 2006 to\nAugust 2007 (before the 2007 burning); therefore the\ntwo burnt treatments had either been burnt once in 2004\nand were measured 28 mo after the last fire (BF1), or\nhad been burnt once per year for the last 3 y, with\nmeasurements taken 4 mo after the last fire (BF3). The\nsite was surrounded by a large expanse of native forest on\nthree sides, and one side was adjacent to pasture (Balch\net al. 2008). We avoided edge effects by placing litterbags\nat least 100m from the pasture and adjacent treatments.\nEnvironmental variables\nWe recorded three forest structural variables that\nindirectly affect decomposition: litter depth, understorey\nvegetation density and canopy openness. Those variables\nwere recorded in 3\u00d73-m quadrats at each grid point\n(n=162 for each plot). Litter depth was measured with\na ruler at the four corners of each quadrat. Understorey\ndensity was indexed by counting how many times live\nvegetationtouchedapole thatwas2.5minheightand3.5\ncm in diameter, placed upright at the four corners of each\nquadrat. Canopy openness was calculated using digital\nhemispherical photographs taken in the centre of each\nquadrat. For each of these measurements, the average\nscorewas used to characterize each3\u00d73-mquadrat, and\nthe average across all representative quadratswasused to\ncharacterize the environmental conditions in each forest\nplot. All data were collected in March (rainy season) and\nEffects of experimental fires on litter decomposition in a seasonally dry Amazonian forest 659\nTable 1.Mean (\u00b1SD) canopyopenness (%),understoreydensity (frequency)and litter depth (cm) in\nunburned forest (UF), once-burned forest (BF1) and thrice-burned forest (BF3).

Temperature and relative humidity\nwere recorded at 15 randomly located points within\neach treatment, using T-RH sensors (Onset Computer\nCorporation, Pocasset, MA, USA) that took readings at\nmidday throughout the experiment.\nLitterbags\nTwolitterbags (representingonecoarseandonefinemesh\nsize) were placed in 120 randomly selected grid points in\neach plot (n=240 per plot and 720 in total). Litterbags\n(25\u00d725cm)weremadeof2-mmnylonmesh,preventing\nthe entrance of macrofauna but allowing mesofauna to\nenter. In half of the litterbags we made three 1-cm2\nperforations on each side to facilitate the colonization of\nmacrofauna(cf.Didham1998).Litterbagswerefilledwith\napproximately 10 g of naturally abscised leaves collected\nrandomly in primary forest and oven dried for 4 d at\n60 \u25e6C. Litterbags were placed in the forest in early\nDecember 2006, during the rainy season. At 2-mo\nintervalswe collected the coarse- and fine-mesh litterbags\nfrom 30 randomly selected grid points from within the\nthree plots. Litterbags were oven dried for 4 d at 60 \u25e6C\nand reweighed to the nearest 0.1 g after removing fine\nroots, invertebrates and mud. Due to damage (mostly\nby leaf cutter ants) only 531 litter bags were analysed,\nbut the sample design remained balanced across factors:\nsampling period (n=134, 143, 116, 138 for periods\n1\u20134), fire treatment (n=180, 170, 181 for unburned,\nonce and thrice-burned forest, respectively) and mesh\ntypes (n=255 and 276 for fine and coarse mesh types,\nrespectively).\nData analyses\nThe difference between forest structural variables,\ntemperatureandrelativehumidity in the three treatments\nwasexaminedusingone-wayANOVAafter checkingdata\nfor normality. Although the variance in relative humidity\nwas lower in thecontrol plots than theburned treatments,\nwe continue to use ANOVA as the results were the same\nusing non-parametric tests (e.g. Kruskal\u2013Wallis) and it\nallows Tukey\u2019s post hoc comparison between treatments.\nDecomposition rates were expressed as remaining dry\nweight in the litterbags after 2, 4, 6 and 8 mo in the\nfield. We converted litter dry weights to the proportion\nof litter weight remaining in the litterbags. The effects\nof fire treatment (UF, BF1 and BF3), mesh size (large\nand small), and time period (four measurements) on\nthe proportion of litter weight remaining were examined\nusing Analysis of Deviance with the \u2018glm\u2019 and \u2018anova\u2019\nfunctions in theRstatistical environment (RDevelopment\nCore Team 2008). We used a quasi-binomial error\nstructure appropriate for the analysis of proportion data,\nand used the F-test to examine significance (Crawley\n2007),whereF is the ratio of thebetween-groupvariation\ndivided by the within-group variation.\nRESULTS\nEnvironmental variables\nAll forest structural variables used were significantly\ndifferent across plots (P<0.001). BF1 showed interme-\ndiate values for all of them (Table 1).

Fire\ntreatment was highly significant in the first (F2,130 =8.9,\nP<0.001), third (F2,112 =10.5, P<0.001) and fourth\n(F2,134 =24.1, P<0.001) sample period, and narrowly\ninsignificant in the second sample period (F2,139 =2.7,\nP=0.07). Mesh size was significant (P<0.05) in\nall sampling periods. The fire treatment\u00d7mesh size\ninteraction was only significant in the second sample\n(F2,137 =4.5, P=0.01).\nDISCUSSION\nThis experiment examined whether fire can affect\ndecomposition rates in seasonally dry tropical forests.We\ndo not attempt to compare between fire regimes, as our\ncomparisons are limited by the different time since the\nlast fire in the burned plots (28 mo in BF1 and 4 mo in\nBF3). However, our results do highlight some important\npatterns, and show that 28moafter a single low-intensity\nfire some aspects of forest functioning that are necessary\nfor nutrient cycling are restored. This was not the case 4\u2013\n12 mo after the last fire in forest that was experimentally\nburned three times in as many years.\nEnvironmental variables\nFire had a clear effect on canopy openness, understorey\nand litter depth, with greater effects seen in BF3 than in\nBF1. This may reflect either the time since the last fire,\nor that burning multiple times has a more severe effect\non forest structure. By increasing the sunlight reaching\nthe floor, canopy gaps favour the rapid growing up of\nshrubs, lianas and large herbs (Denslow & Hartshorn\n1994), leading to an increase in understorey density\n(Barlow & Peres 2004). However, our measurements did\nnot detect any increase in understorey density 1 y (BF3)\nor even 3 y (BF1) after the last fire. These results suggest\nthat seasonally dry Amazonian forests that are located\nclose to cerrado (Brazilian savanna) may have a different\ndynamic of regeneration after disturbance from humid\nforests further from the forest\u2013cerrado transition zone.\nLitter depth also was higher in UF, intermediary in BF1\nand lower in BF3, and these results can be linked to the\ntime since the most recent fire, as BF1 had more time to\naccumulate leaf-litterwhileBF3didnot.Temperatureand\nhumidity in our surveyed plots appeared strongly linked\nto changes in the forest structure; UF generally had the\nEffects of experimental fires on litter decomposition in a seasonally dry Amazonian forest 661\nlowest temperatures and highest relative humidity, BF1\nshowed intermediate values, and BF3 showed the highest\ntemperaturesand lowest relativehumidity.Temperatures\nare generally 3\u20134 \u25e6C hotter in canopy gaps (Holdsworth\n&Uhl 1997), also increasing the temperature of the forest\nin general (Barlow et al. 2007, Nepstad et al. 1999, Uhl &\nKauffman 1990).\nLitter decomposition\nThere is no evidence that fire affected decomposition\n28 mo after a single fire, and these forests appeared to\nfunction in a similar way to unburned forest. The fact\nthat there were significant differences in forest structure\nbut no difference in decomposition between UF and BF1\nplotssuggests thatbelow-groundleaf-litterdecomposition\nprocessesmaynotbe stronglycoupledwithabove-ground\nforest structure. These results are comparable to those\nfrom Chaco\u00b4n & Dezzeo (2007), in which forests showed\nsimilar mass loss a long time after the last fire. Our\nresults alsodemonstrate that recurrentfires canresult ina\nsystemwith reduced litter decomposition rates. This effect\nmay partly be due to the higher temperatures and lower\nrelative humidity seen in BF3 (Figure 1), whichmayhave\nresulted in decomposition being more limited by water.\nThere are no comparable studies on litter decomposition\nin tropical forests that have succumbed to recurrent fires.\nLitter biota provides a second potential explanation\nfor differences in decomposition rates between the fire\ntreatments. Macrofauna appeared to play amuch greater\nrole in decomposition in BF3 than in either BF1 or UF,\nas macrofaunal exclusion appeared to result in lower\ndecomposition rates in BF3, but had no effect in BF1\nor UF (Figure 2). However, the role of macrofauna does\nnot explain all of the reduction in decomposition in\nBF3, as the decomposition rate in the fine-mesh bags\n(excluding macrofauna) were still lower in BF3 than\nother fire treatments acrossmost of the seasonal samples.\nThis result suggests that annual burning may reduce\nthe biomass or alter the composition of soil microbes,\nand\/or mesofauna, all of which could have an effect on\ndecomposition rates (Bradford et al. 2002, Waldrop et\nal. 2000). Other studies that have examined the effect\nof soil fauna on decomposition in the tropics have also\nfound varying results. For example, litter mass loss was\nnot found to be related to the population of litter-feeding\ninvertebrates in two studies based inMalaysia (Anderson\net al. 1983) and the central Brazilian Amazon (Didham\n1998), but was found to be related to mesh size in\nNigeria (Swift et al. 1981), Para\u00b4, Brazil (Nepstad et al.\n2002) and Amazonas, Brazil (Vasconcelos & Laurance\n2005).\nThe similar decomposition rates in BF1 and UF suggest\nthat one single fire may represent a disturbance of\nrelatively low impact tonutrient cycling, reflecting results\nfromold secondary forests (Barlow et al. 2007,Ewel1976,\nLoranger et al. 2002, Swift et al. 1981, Xuluc-Tolosa\net al. 2003), selective logging (Anderson et al. 1983,\nBurghouts et al. 1992), large forest fragments (Didham\n1998, Mesquita et al. 1998, Rubinstein & Vasconcelos\n2005, Vasconcelos & Laurance 2005), severe dry seasons\n(Nepstad et al. 2002), and old burned forest (Chaco\u00b4n\n& Dezzeo 2007). However, decomposition rates were\nconsiderably lower in the recurrently burned plot (BF3),\nsuggesting that the impact of these fires on leaf-litter\ndecomposition is comparable to those found following\nthe most severe forms of forest disturbance, including\ndeforestation (Ewel 1976), conversion to pasture (Kumar\n& Deepu 1992) or plantations (Barlow et al. 2007), and\nthe creation of very small fragments (Didham 1998,\nRubinstein & Vasconcelos 2005).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAnnually burned, seasonally dry Amazon forests\napparently present a negative fire feedback, as low litter\nproduction acts to reduce fuel input (Balch et al. 2008).\nHowever, this study shows that important ecosystem\nfunctions suchas decomposition arenot recoveredwithin\n1 y of the most recent recurrent fire. This change in\nfunction appeared to be related to changes in both the\nmicroclimate and forest structure, although the role of\nmesh size indicates that changes in the litter and soil\nbiota caused by the fire treatment may also be important.\nThe similarity of decomposition in once-burned forests\n28mo after themost recent fire comparedwith unburned\nforest suggests that one single fire does not have long-\ntermnegative effects onat least someecological processes.\nHowever, we would caution against extrapolating these\nresults from experimental fires in very seasonal forests\nto other situations in Amazonia, and suggest that more\nwork is required to fully understand the scale of effects\nof fire on ecosystem functioning in these fire-sensitive\necosystems.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nJ.
