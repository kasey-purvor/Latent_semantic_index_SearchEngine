INTRODUCTION\nShell closures form the cornerstones of models that describe\nthe structure of the atomic nucleus. In exotic nuclei with\nextreme ratios of N\/Z, the shell structure as established for\nstable nuclei is modified: \u201cclassic\u201d magic numbers break down\nand new shell gaps develop (e.g., Refs. [1\u20134]).\nA prime example of the modification of a canonical\nmagic number is the so-called island of inversion near 31Na\nat N \u2248 20 [5\u20138]. Contrary to the predominantly spherical\nshape of stable nuclei with magic or close to magic numbers\nof protons or neutrons, nuclei in the island of inversion\nassume deformed shapes in their ground states (g.s.). In a\nmicroscopical picture this is explained by the dominance of\nthe deformation driving \u03bd(sd)\u22122(fp)+2 particle-hole intruder\nconfigurations (2h\u00af \u03c9 excitations across the N = 20 shell gap)\nin the ground- and low-energy excited states. The existence\nof the island of inversion is possible due to a reduction of the\nsd-fp shell gap caused by the tensor force [2,8].\nThe tensor force has been shown to influence the shell\nstructure in a unique and robust way throughout the nuclear\nchart [2,9]. Similarly to the island of inversion near 31Na\na characteristic shell evolution is expected in the region of\nnuclei with protons in the f7\/2 orbit and a closed or nearly\nclosed neutron pf shell, i.e., for the N \u2248 40 isotones between\nCa and Ni. The attractive monopole part of the tensor force,\nacting between \u03c0f7\/2 protons and \u03bdf5\/2 neutrons, is weakened\nas protons are removed from the\u03c0f7\/2 orbital when going from\nnickel toward calcium, and in effect, the \u03bdf5\/2 orbit shifts up\nin energy. As a result, the gap between the \u03bdf5\/2 and \u03bdg9\/2\norbits, which is already rather small in 68Ni [10,11], is expected\nto be further reduced, provoking neutron pair scattering to\nthe intruder \u03bdg9\/2 orbit already for nuclei with fewer than\n40 neutrons. In analogy to Z \u2248 11, N \u2248 20 nuclei, the\n*adrich@nscl.msu.edu\nexistence of a new island of inversion in the region of\nN \u2248 40 isotopes of Cr and Ti has been suggested [3,12,13].\nThe arguments are, however, rather qualitative as theoretical\ncalculations in this region face difficulties related to the large\ndimension of the necessary model space and the lack of reliable\neffective interactions.\nOn the experimental side the growing body of data\nsuggests an increasing importance of the \u03bdg9\/2 orbital for\nN \u2248 40, \u03c0f7\/2 nuclei [10,14\u201323]. In particular, energies of\nthe first excited 2+ states measured in even-even iron and\nchromium isotopes (see Fig. 1) exhibit a decreasing trend\ntoward N = 40, which is often interpreted in terms of an onset\nof deformation. The nucleus 64Cr with Z = 24 and N = 40\nis expected to be the most deformed in the region and thus to\nexhibit the lowest E(2+) energy [13,15].\nII. EXPERIMENT\nIn the present work we report on the \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy\nof neutron-rich, N \u2248 40, iron isotopes and on inclusive two-\nproton knockout cross section for reactions in this region. The\nexperiment was carried out at the National Superconducting\nCyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University.\nA primary beam of 76Ge was accelerated to an energy of\n130 MeV\/nucleon by the Coupled Cyclotron Facility (CCF)\nand fragmented in a 470-mg\/cm2-thick 9Be target. Projec-\ntile fragments were then separated in the A1900 fragment\nseparator using the B\u03c1-\u0006E-B\u03c1 method [24]. The resulting\ncocktail beam was delivered to the target position of the\nS800 spectrograph [25] where a secondary 9Be target was\nlocated. Several different settings of the A1900 separator\noptimized to maximize the intensities of 66Fe, 67Co, 69Co,\n68Ni, and 70Ni beams were used during the experiment. The\nmomentum acceptance of the A1900 was restricted to 1% for\nall settings except for the 66Fe and 70Ni projectiles for which\nit was increased to 2%. The resulting cocktail beams were\n0556-2813\/2008\/77(5)\/054306(6) 054306-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nP. ADRICH et al.

The\npurities of the secondary beams were 33% for 66Fe, 84% for\n67Co, 17% for 69Co, 52% for 68Ni, and 6% for 70Ni beam.\nDifferent components of the cocktail beam were identified\nevent by event by means of the time-of-flight measured with a\npair of thin plastic scintillators located before the target.\n68Ni is known to have an isomeric first excited 0+ state\nwith t1\/2 = 270 ns that can decay only by internal conversion.\nThe projectiles in our experiment are available as fully\nstripped ions and the decay by conversion electron is, to first\norder, strongly hindered. For example, the isomeric content\nof the 68Ni secondary beam from the first excited 0+ state\nand from the 5\u2212, t1\/2 = 0.86 ms isomer were measured in\nan experiment at GANIL [10] to be <2% and 18(5)%,\nrespectively. In that experiment the 68Ni secondary beam\nwas produced from fragmentation of 70Zn on a 58Ni target\nat about 66 MeV\/nucleon. In the current experiment, it was\nnot possible to measure the isomeric content of the secondary\nbeams. Because the mechanisms of isomer population in\nfragmentation reactions are not understood, it is impossible\nto estimate the isomeric content of the secondary 68Ni beam\nused in the current experiment. It could, however, have been\ndifferent from the GANIL experiment cited above, because\na different combination of primary beam, target, and beam\nenergy was used.\nThe projectile-like residues produced from reactions in the\nsecondary target were transported to the S800 focal plane,\nwhere they were identified event by event from the energy\nloss measured in an ionization chamber and the time-of-flight\nmeasured with plastic scintillators between the object position\nand the focal plane of the S800. One-proton knockout reactions\nfrom 67Co and 69Co projectile beams and two-proton knockout\nreactions from 68Ni, 70Ni, and 66Fe beams were studied in\nfive separate runs. For each run the S800 spectrograph was\nset to accept the projectile-like knockout residue of interest.\nThe secondary reaction target thickness was 376 mg\/cm2 for\nthe 66Fe run and 188 mg\/cm2 for all other runs. The mean\nmidtarget energy of the projectile was 73.5 MeV\/nucleon for\n66Fe, 84.3 MeV\/nucleon for 67Co, 77.8 MeV\/nucleon for 69Co,\n74.7 MeV\/nucleon for 68Ni, and 71.8 MeV\/nucleon for 70Ni.\nExamples of particle identification plots are shown in\nFig. 2.

Such\nmeasurements were done for all projectile beams and served\nas normalizations for the subsequent measurements of the\nreaction cross sections.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 2 shows the identification of\nreaction residues. In the example shown, the field of the S800\nspectrograph was set to match the magnetic rigidity of the\n66Fe residue produced in the two-proton knockout reaction\nfrom 68Ni projectile. Because of the large acceptance of the\nspectrograph, a number of other isotopes, produced in a variety\nof reaction channels, were transmitted to the focal plane at the\nsame time.\nInclusive cross sections for two-proton knockout reactions\nwere derived from the yields of projectile-like residues\ndetected at the S800 focal plane and the number of incoming\nprojectile ions, taking into account the thickness of the sec-\nondary target. Systematic uncertainties arising from particle\nidentification (5%), stability and purity of the beam (5%), and\nhomogeneity of the target thickness (0.5%) were added to the\nstatistical uncertainty in quadrature.\nPrompt \u03b3 -ray emission from excited reaction residues\nwas measured with SeGA, an array of 32-fold segmented\nhigh-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors [26]. The array was\nset up around the target in two rings with seven detectors\nat 37\u25e6 and nine detectors at 90\u25e6 relative to the beam axis.\nThe total energy deposited in a HPGe crystal is readout\n054306-2\nIn-BEAM \u03b3 -RAY SPECTROSCOPY AND INCLUSIVE . . .

GEANT3 [27] simulations suc-\ncessfully modeled the efficiency of the array and provided the\ndetector response for in-beam data by taking into account the\nLorentz boost arising from the velocity of the reaction residues\nat the moment of the \u03b3 -ray emission (v\/c around 0.37).\nFigure 3 shows a scaled, GEANT-simulated response super-\nimposed on the \u03b3 -ray spectrum measured in coincidence with\n66Fe fragments produced in 9Be(67Co,66Fe)X reaction. Due to\nthe coincidence condition imposed on the \u03b3 -rays detected in\nSeGA and heavy ions measured at the S800 focal plane, the\nresulting \u03b3 -ray spectra feature very little background.\nMain sources of systematic errors on the reconstructed\nenergies are associated with the uncertainty in the exact target\nlocation relative to the center of the SeGA array and with the\nuncertainty in the mean velocity of the reaction residues. The\ntotal systematic error on the energy of the \u03b3 -ray transition is\non the order of 1%, whereas the energy resolution is 2\u20133%\n(full width at half maximum) at 1 MeV depending on the\nmomentum spread of the beam and the target thickness.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn the first part of the experiment the in-beam \u03b3 -ray\nspectroscopy of 66Fe and 68Fe was studied. In Fig. 4 we present\nDoppler-corrected \u03b3 -ray spectra measured in coincidence\nwith 66Fe and 68Fe residues produced in two reactions: by\none-proton knockout from 67Co and 69Co, respectively, and by\ntwo-proton knockout from 68Ni and 70Ni, respectively.\nA. 66Fe\nThe \u03b3 -ray spectra measured in coincidence with 66Fe\nresidues display three strong peaks. In the one-proton knockout\nreaction the centroids of these peaks are 571(6), 833(9),\nand 957(10) keV and in two-proton knockout the centroids\nare 567(6), 832(9), and 957(10) keV.

(Color online) Doppler-corrected \u03b3 ray energy spectra\nmeasured in coincidence with 66Fe (two top panels) and 68Fe (two\nbottom panels) projectile-like residues. The reaction used to produce\ngiven residue and velocity used for Doppler correction are indicated\nin each panel. The peak centroids are indicated (in units of keV)\ntogether with their experimental uncertainties.\nuncertainties the peaks observed in both spectra have the same\ncentroids and thus we assume they correspond to the same\ntransitions. In addition, in the one-proton knockout channel\nwe observe a weak transition at 1310(15) keV, which is not\nseen in the two-proton knockout spectrum.\nThe energy of the 2+1 state in 66Fe has been previously\nestablished at 573 keV by Hannawald et al. [15] in \u03b3 -ray\nspectroscopy following \u03b2 decay of 66Mn. In the same experi-\nment a candidate for the 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition at 840 keV was\nproposed.\nThe transitions observed here at 571(6) and 567(6) keV\nin one- and two-proton knockout channel, respectively, are\nthe most intensive ones and within experimental uncertainties\nthey are in agreement with the 573-keV transition observed by\nHannawald et al. We thus assume they correspond to the 2+1 \u2192\n0+g.s. transition in 66Fe. Further, the \u03b3 -ray observed here at\n833 keV is in agreement with the 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition tenta-\ntively proposed by Hannawald et al. at 840 keV.\nThe experimental statistics does not allow to draw any\nconclusions from study of \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences. It is thus hard to\npropose assignments for the remaining transitions observed at\n957 and 1310 keV. One of those may correspond to a 6+1 \u2192 4+1\ntransition. This supposition is based on the notion that spins\nof the two f7\/2 holes can be coupled only to a total spin of 0,\n2, 4, or 6 units of angular momentum. It is thus reasonable to\n054306-3\nP. ADRICH et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 054306 (2008)\nexpect a population of the 6+1 excited state in a proton knockout\nexperiment. This, however, does not exclude a possibility of\npopulation of nonyrast states. In fact, population of 2+2 states\nwas observed in knockout reactions, e.g., in Ref. [28].\nB. 68Fe\nPrior to this experiment no excited states in 68Fe were\nreported in the literature. Here, two transitions are clearly\nobserved at 517(6) and 859(9) keV in the spectrum obtained\nin coincidence with 68Fe residues produced in one-proton\nknockout from 69Co. There is also a weak indication of a\ntransition at 808(9) keV. The \u03b3 -ray spectrum resulting from\ncoincidences with 68Fe produced in two-proton knockout has\nfar fewer statistics and displays only an indication of a \u03b3 ray at\nthe same energy as the most intense transition observed in the\none-proton knockout spectrum. Because the 517 keV \u03b3 -ray is\nthe most intense observed in coincidence with 68Fe residues\nwe tentatively associate it with the 2+1 to the ground-state\ntransition. The \u03b3 ray observed at 859 keV may correspond to\nthe 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition; however, similarly to the case of 66Fe,\nother assignment cannot be excluded.\nC. Inclusive two-proton knockout cross sections\nIn the present experiment an attempt was made to perform\n\u03b3 -ray spectroscopy of 6424Cr40. The intensities of secondary\nbeams in the region of 64Cr available at existing fragmentation\nfacilities do not allow for \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy with \u03b2 decay\nor Coulomb excitation. We therefore examined the possibility\nof populating excited states in 64Cr by means of two-proton\nknockout from a fast secondary beam of 66Fe impinging on a\nthick secondary 9Be target.\nThe inclusive cross section for this reaction was measured at\n\u03c3inc = 0.13(5) mb. This small cross section combined with the\nintensity of the secondary 66Fe beam available at the time of the\nexperiment has rendered any meaningful \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy\nunfeasible within the present work.\nHowever, it is very interesting to compare the inclusive\ncross sections for all two-proton knockout reactions measured\n64Cr\n66Fe\n68Ni\n68Fe\n70Ni\nN = 40 N = 42\nZ = 24\nZ = 26\nZ = 28\n\u03c3inc=1.42(25) mb \u03c3inc=0.49(5) mb\n\u03c3inc=0.13(5) mb\nFIG. 5.

Note a striking\ndifference in the cross section for reactions along N = 40.\nin the same experiment in this region. As illustrated in\nFig. 5, in addition to the 9Be(66Fe,64Cr)X reaction, two other\ntwo-proton knockout reactions were studied and their cross\nsections extracted: 9Be(68Ni,66Fe)X with \u03c3inc = 1.42(25) mb\nand 9Be(70Ni,68Fe)X with \u03c3inc = 0.49(5) mb. The order-of-\nmagnitude drop in cross section for the reactions along the\nN = 40 isotone line is striking.\nIt has been shown that the two-proton knockout from\nneutron-rich projectiles is predominantly a direct process [29].\nThe sequential process of one-proton knockout followed by\nthe evaporation of a second proton from an intermediate\nnucleus is strongly hindered because the neutron separation\nthreshold in a neutron-rich nucleus is in general much lower\nthan the proton separation threshold. The reaction can thus be\ndescribed as a sudden, direct process, involving only a limited\nnumber of degrees of freedom, a process in which two protons\nare removed from a projectile while the rest of nucleons\nremains essentially undisturbed. A reaction theory formalism,\nusing eikonal dynamics and microscopic, correlated two-\nnucleon transition densities from shell-model calculations, has\nbeen developed recently [30,31]. The calculated two-nucleon\namplitudes carry the nuclear structure details on the parentage\nand phase of the participating two-nucleon configurations in\nthe ground state of the projectile with respect to the final states\nof the projectile-like reaction residue.\nWe can compare the experimental cross sections to those\ncalculated from wave functions obtained from the GXPF1\ninteraction [32] in the fp model space for N = 40. The pf\nshell neutrons have a closed-shell configuration for N = 40.\nFor Z = 28 the GXPF1 interaction gives a large single-particle\nenergy gap between the \u03c0f7\/2 and \u03c0f5\/2, p3\/2, and p1\/2\norbitals, and the proton wave functions for Z < 28 are domi-\nnated by the \u03c0 (f7\/2)n configurations. Following the formalism\ndescribed in Ref. [31] the calculated partial cross sections\nfor 9Be(68Ni,66Fe)X are 0.14, 0.45, 0.51, and 0.66 mb for\nfinal states with spins I\u03c0 = 0+, 2+, 4+, and 6+, respectively,\nwith an inclusive cross section of 1.76 mb. We have used the\naverage quenching factor of RS(2N ) = 0.50 obtained from\nthe systematics discussed in Ref. [33]. This cross section is in\nreasonable agreement with the experimental value of 1.42(25).\nHowever, excitation energies for 66Fe obtained with GXPF1\nof 0, 1.34, 2.14, and 2.48 MeV for 0+, 2+, 4+ and 6+ state,\nrespectively, are not in overall agreement with experiment.\nThe lower 2+ energy observed in experiment is a clear signal\nthat \u03bd(pf )n\u22122(g9\/2)+2 (n = 20) configurations are important\nfor the low-spin states. Thus, we should expect admixtures of\n\u03bd(pf )n and \u03bd(pf )n\u22122(g9\/2)+2 in the spectrum of 66Fe with the\ncalculated 2N cross section split according to the amount of\n\u03bd(pf )n component in the wave functions.\nThe calculated partial cross sections for 9Be(66Fe,64Cr)X\nare 0.19, 0.21, 0.23, and 0.30 mb for final states with spins\nI\u03c0 = 0+, 2+, 4+, and 6+, respectively, with an inclusive cross\nsection of 0.93 mb. The drop in cross section from 1.76 to\n0.93 mb for the 68Ni and 66Fe projectiles, qualitatively comes\nfrom the f 27\/2 spectroscopic factors whose sum is given by the\ncombinatorial factor p(p \u2212 1)\/2 with p = 8 and p = 6 for\nthe number of valence protons. The calculated value for the\n66Fe projectile is much larger than the experimental value of\n0.13(5). The states of 64Cr will have admixtures of \u03bd(pf )n and\n054306-4\nIn-BEAM \u03b3 -RAY SPECTROSCOPY AND INCLUSIVE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 054306 (2008)\n\u03bd(pf )n\u22122(g9\/2)+2 (plus perhaps even higher number of particle\nexcited to g9\/2). The cross section for a specific final state could\nbe very small if the initial and final neutron configurations\nare different. But total calculated cross section of 0.93 mb\nshould be obtained when summed over all final states. Thus,\nthe observed small inclusive cross section indicates that most\nof the expected strength is going to levels that lie above the\nneutron decay threshold. The masses for these nuclei are not\nmeasured [the Audi-Wapstra extrapolation gives a value of\nSn = 5.7(5) MeV].\nIt would be very interesting to measure the cross section\nto all final states, including those above the neutron decay\nthreshold. It is, however, unclear whether such a measurement\nis feasible as it would require an ability to discriminate the\n63Cr fragments produced directly in the 2p1n removal from\nthe 66Fe beam from the same 63Cr produced indirectly by\none-neutron evaporation from 64Cr. In both cases, there would\nbe the same particles in the final state and it is not clear\nwhat could be the unique signature of their origin. Even if the\nresulting free neutron could be effectively detected, its energy\nand direction of momentum vector in the laboratory frame in\nany case would not be much different from the energy and\ndirection of momentum vector of the beam.\nIt is reasonable to expect that structural changes are taking\nplace between nickel and chromium at N \u2248 40 related to\nthe neutron shell gap at N = 40. It is generally accepted\nthat the tensor force reduces the gap between the neutron\npf shell and \u03bdg9\/2 orbital as protons are removed from the\nf7\/2 orbital and neutrons added to the f5\/2 orbital [2,3,12].\nAs a result, appreciable occupancy of the \u03bdg9\/2 orbital due to\nneutron pair scattering can be expected already for N < 40.\nThe strength of the interaction and thus the magnitude of\nthe gap reduction and \u03bdg9\/2 occupancies are not precisely\nknown.\nA number of experimental studies on nickel, iron, and\nchromium isotopes with N \u0001 40 provide indirect evidence of\nthis effect and suggest an increasing importance of the \u03bdg9\/2\norbital already for N < 40 as Z is reduced from 28 toward the\nmiddle of the \u03c0f7\/2 shell [10,14\u201321].\nAn analogy might be drawn between the island of inversion\nnear 31Na at N \u2248 20 and the region of neutron-rich chromium\nand titanium isotopes at N \u2248 40 [3,12,13]. In the island of\ninversion in the region of 31Na20, the nuclear ground states are\ndominated by deformation-driving particle-hole 2h\u00af \u03c9 intruder\nconfigurations of the type \u03bd(sd)\u22122(fp)+2. A somewhat similar\nphenomenon is expected to exist in the region of neutron-\nrich N \u2248 40 nuclei around 62Ti and 64Cr with the 0h\u00af \u03c9 space\nconsisting of the pf shell and 2h\u00af \u03c9 intruder configurations in\nthe sdg shell.\nOne may expect that the existence of such a new island\nof inversion would imprint a signature on the cross sections\nfor direct reactions in the vicinity of the island and especially\non reactions that cross the boundary of the island (i.e., with a\nprojectile from outside of the island and a residue from within\nthe island). Such a case has been recently studied by Gade et al.\n[33] with the two-proton knockout reaction 9Be(38Si,36Mg)X.\nThe ground state of 38Si is well described within the 0h\u00af \u03c9\nspace, whereas, prior to the experiment, the structure of the\n36Mg was unknown. Small partial cross sections of \u03c3 (g.s.) =\n0.058(9) mb to the ground state and \u03c3 (2+1 ) = 0.042(8) mb to\nthe first excited state of 36Mg, compared with much larger\ncross sections calculated theoretically with the model space\nrestricted to 0h\u00af \u03c9 configurations, led to the conclusion that the\nstructure of low-energy states in 36Mg is dominated by intruder\nconfigurations. Thus, 36Mg has been placed within the island\nof inversion.\nA similar, quantitative analysis is not yet possible in\nthe region of N \u2248 40. The realistic two-nucleon amplitudes\ncannot be computed due to the lack of a reliable shell-model\nHamiltonian and also due to the large dimension of the required\nmodel space.\nFollowing the arguments of Ref. [33] for the case of\n9Be(38Si,36Mg)X two-proton knockout together with the pre-\ndicted reduction of the gap between normal and intruder\norbitals for N \u2248 40, Z < 28 nuclei, the discrepancy between\nthe experimental cross sections reported here and the one\ncalculated for the pf model space seems to support, at least\nqualitatively, the hypothesis of significant differences in the\namount of intruder configurations in the ground state and\nlow-energy excited states of 68Ni, 66Fe, and 64Cr. Certainly,\nmore work, both on the theoretical and experimental sides, is\nnecessary to verify this hypothesis and to gain further insight\ninto the evolution of nuclear structure in this region.\nIV. SUMMARY\nIn summary, in-beam \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy of neutron-rich\n66Fe40 and 68Fe42 has been studied at the NSCL. These hard-\nto-reach nuclei have been produced and excited by means of\none- and two-proton knockout at intermediate beam energy.\nThe previous measurement of the E(2+1 ) and E(4+1 ) energy in\n66Fe has been confirmed. In addition, \u03b3 rays at 957(10) and\n1310(15) keV were observed in coincidence with 66Fe.\nPrior to this experiment, no excited states in 68Fe were\nreported in the literature. Here, we observed a \u03b3 ray at\n517(6) keV that we associate with the 2+1 \u2192 0+g.s. transition\nin 68Fe. In addition, a \u03b3 ray at 859(9) keV is observed in\none-proton knockout channel to 68Fe. There is also a weak\nindication of a transition at 808(9) keV.\nThe \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy of 64Cr was attempted. How-\never, a surprisingly small inclusive cross section for\nthe 9Be(66Fe,64Cr)X two-proton knockout reaction, \u03c3inc =\n0.13(5) mb, was determined. It is suggested that this small\ncross section is an indication of intruder dominated low-energy\nstructure of 64Cr. Advances in theory as well as in experiment\nare crucial to confirm this interpretation and to gain further\ninsights into the evolution of nuclear structure in this region.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by US National Science Founda-\ntion under Grants PHY-0606007 and PHY-0555366 and by the\nUnited Kingdom Science and Technology Facilities Council\n(STFC) under Grant EP\/D003628.\n054306-5\nP.
