It has been shown that pyrrole  may  be  electrochemically  polymerised  in  the\npresence of these sulfonated  single  wall  carbon  nanotubes  as  dopant  ion.  The  polymerisation\nresults in a conductive, electroactive polypyrrole  doped  with  sulfonated  tubes  being  formed  at\nunusually low potentials. This reduction of polymerisation potential has enabled the  formation  of\na higher activity horse radish peroxidase polymer composite than can  be  formed  with  traditional\npolyelectrolytes,  or  without  supporting  electrolyte,  thus  demonstrating  the   potential   of   this\ncomposite material as a host matrix for biomolecules.\nAbstract\nUsing facile diazonium chemistry, sulfonate groups have been covalently attached  to  single  wall\ncarbon nanotubes. The resulting sulfonated tubes form a stable aqueous dispersion in the  presence\nof  pyrrole  monomer.  Subsequent  electropolymerisation  results  in  a  conductive,   electroactive\npolypyrrole doped with sulfonated tubes being formed at unusually low  potentials.  The  potential\nof this material as a host matrix for  biomolecules  has  been  demonstrated  by  entrapping  horse-\nradish peroxidase directly in the polypyrrole during composite formation.\nKeywords: functionalised carbon nanotubes; single wall carbon nanotubes;  conducting  polymer;\npolypyrrole; horse-radish peroxidase.\nIntroduction\nThe  unique  electronic  and  mechanical  properties  of  carbon  nanotubes  (CNTs)  have   enticed\nresearchers  into  investigating  their  use  in  a  variety   of   composite   materials.   In   particular,\nconducting  polymer-CNT  (CP-CNT)   composites   offer   the   promise   of   enhanced   polymer\nelectroactivity with significantly improved  mechanical  strength.  Several  researchers  have  used\naligned CNT structures as electrodes and electrochemically  deposited  polypyrrole  (Ppy)  around\nthe  nanotubes  in  the  presence  of   a   supporting   electrolyte[?],[?].   These   aligned   Ppy-CNT\ncomposite structures have a much higher Young\u2019s modulus1, charge  storage  capacitance[?],  and\nimproved electrochemical performance[?] including faster response times3, than pristine Ppy.\nPolypyrrole-single wall carbon  nanotube  (Ppy-SWNT)  nanowires,  prepared  chemically,\nusing  cationic  and  non-ionic  surfactants  to  disperse  the  SWNTs,  exhibited   better   electrical\nproperties than pristine  Ppy[?],[?].  Ppy-CNT  composite  fibrils  approximately  100nm  in  width\nwere prepared with a conductivity of 16  S  cm-1  compared  to  3  S  cm-1  for  Ppy  itself[?].  ESR\nspectra of this composite indicated however, that no chemical interaction takes place  between  the\nCNTs  and  Ppy,  and  that  the  nanotubes  function  only  as  a  template  during   polymerisation.\nPolypyrrole-multi-walled carbon nanotube (Ppy-MWNT) films, prepared  electrochemically  from\na dispersion  of  MWNTs  in  dodecylbenzene  sulfonate  containing  pyrrole,  showed  nano-scale\nfeatures due to the MWNTs[?]. Cyclic voltammetry  however  indicated  that  the  electrochemical\nactivity of these films resulted from Ppy alone, while the conductivity of Ppy with and without the\nnanotubes was reported as being similar.\nFunctionalised CNTs have also been used as dopant molecules in Ppy. For  example,  Ppy-\nMWNT films were prepared using oxidised MWNTs as dopants[?]. These materials have a higher\ncapacitance than  similarly  prepared  Ppy  with  more  conventional  dopants[?],[?].  Snook  et  al.\ninvestigated the intercalation behaviour of these Ppy-MWNT  films  on  QCM  crystals[?].  Cyclic\nvoltammetry carried out concurrently  with  QCM  measurements  indicated  that  upon  oxidation,\nanion uptake dominated, implying that  the  oxidised  anionic  MWNTs  only  partially  doped  the\npolypyrrole.\nGiven the well-established doping capability of sulfonate groups, we  undertook  to  attach\nthese to CNTs and determine the efficacy of the sulfonated CNTs  as  a  Ppy  dopant.  Zhou  et  al.\nhave reported the chemical polymerisation of pyrrole in the presence of sulfonated  SWNT  bucky\npaper using iron chloride as the oxidant[?]. This  produced  a  Ppy-bucky  paper  electrode  with  a\nspecific capacitance over 6 times higher than  pristine  bucky  paper.  We  have  utilised  protocols\ndeveloped by Dyke et al.[?] to produce sulfonated CNTs  and  then  incorporated  these  as  dopant\n\u201cmolecules\u201d   into   electrodeposited   Ppy   films.   The   use   of   CNT   dopants   facilitates    the\npolymerisation of pyrrole at a potential lower than observed  for  conventional  dopant  molecules.\nThis facilitated the incorporation of the horse radish peroxidase (HRP)  enzyme  into  the  polymer\nfilm during synthesis. Additionally, the presence  of  the  functionalised  CNTs  gave  a  three-fold\nincrease in the capacitance of the Ppy film.\nExperimental\n1 Materials\nPhosphate  buffered  saline  solution  (PBS)  was  prepared  as  described  elsewhere[?].  All  other\nchemicals, single wall carbon  nanotubes  (SWNT,  HiPCo  produced  from  CNI),  sulfanilic  acid\n(Ajax Finechem), sodium nitrate (Aldrich), sulphuric  acid  (Ajax  Finechem),  sodium  hydroxide\n(BDH), acetone (Ajax Finechem),  pyrrole  (Merck),  sodium  p-toluene  sulfonate  (pTS,  Merck),\nsodium  polystyrene  sulfonate  (PSS,  Aldrich),  sodium  chloride  (Sigma),  30%  (v\/v)  hydrogen\nperoxide    solution    (Merck),    horse-radish    peroxidase    (HRP)    (Sigma),    2,2-azino-bis-(3-\nethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) (Sigma) were used as received.\n2 Instrumentation\nElectrochemical  polymerisation,  characterisation  and  amperometric  sensing  experiments  were\nperformed  using  an  eDAQ  e-corder  401  and   potentiostat\/galvanostat   EA   160   with   Chart\nv5.1.2\/EChem  v2.0.2  software  (AD   Instruments).   BAS   CV-27,   eDAQ   e-corder   401   and\npotentiostat\/galvanostat EA 160 with Chart v5.1.2 software were used for  electrochemical  quartz\ncrystal microbalance (ECQM) experiments using a Stanford Research Systems ECQM  200.  Gold\ncoated  AT-cut  quartz  crystal  electrodes  from  Stanford  Research  Systems,   nominal   5   MHz\nresonant frequency, were used for this investigation.\nUV-visible spectra were measured using  a  Shimadzu  1601  UV-visible  spectrophotometer\nand a 1 cm path length cell. Raman spectra  were  measured  with  a  Jobin  Yvon  Horiba  HR800\nspectrometer using a 632.8 nm laser utilizing a  300-line  grating.  Scanning  electron  microscopy\n(SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi S900 field  emission  scanning  electron  microscope\n(FESEM). Samples for FESEM were sputter coated with chromium  prior  to  analysis.   Electrical\nconductivity measurements were made with  a  Jandel  Model  RM2  four  point  probe  resistivity\ntester. The elemental analysis was performed  with  a  Carlo  Erba  Elemental  Analyser  EA  1108\nusing a flash combustion technique (Campbell Microanalytical Laboratory,  University  of  Otago,\nNew Zealand). Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using  a  Thermo  Gravimetric\nAnalyser TGA Q500 (TA Instruments) at a heating rate of 10(\/min and air flow (60 mL\/min).\n3 SWNT functionalisation\nSingle wall carbon nanotubes were functionalised as described previously14 using  sulfanilic  acid\nas the  4-substituted  aniline.  Typically  SWNTs  (60  mg,  5.0  mmol  carbon)  were  stirred  with\nsulfanilic acid (4.0 equiv\/mol of carbon), sodium nitrite (4.0 equiv\/mol  of  carbon)  and  sulphuric\nacid (4.8 equiv\/mol of carbon) as a paste for one hour at 60\u00b0C under N2 to yield  SWNT-PhSO3Na\n(Scheme 1).  The paste was diluted with acetone and  filtered  through  a  PVDF  membrane  (0.45\n\u00b5m). The  collected  solid  was  washed  with  acetone  until  the  filtrate  became  colourless.  The\nresulting black solid was briefly sonicated in dilute aq. NaOH to remove any  unreacted  sulfanilic\nacid and the dispersion was filtered through a PVDF membrane  (0.45  \u00b5m),  followed  by  rinsing\nwith dilute aq. NaOH and water. The solid was dried under vacuum for 2 hours at 60\u00b0C  to  give  a\nproduct in which 1 in 32 carbons were functionalised by  a  phenyl  sulfonate  group  according  to\nthermogravimetric analysis\n4 Electrodeposition of polypyrrole films\nThe electro-polymerisation  of  pyrrole  was  carried  out  on  gold-coated  mylar  and  gold-coated\nindium tin oxide (ITO)-glass, both with a surface area of 1.0 cm2, and gold-coated  quartz  crystals\nwith a surface area of 1.37 cm2. Ppy films were grown  galvanostatically  at  0.25  mA  cm-2  from\nsolutions of 0.2 M (30 mins) and 1.0 M (5 mins) pyrrole respectively in  the  presence  of  SWNT-\nPhSO3Na as electrolyte (0.3% w\/v), and 0.2 M pyrrole in the  presence  of  0.2  M  pTS  or  0.2  M\nPSS. A platinum mesh  auxiliary  electrode  and  Ag\/AgCl  reference  electrode  were  used.  After\ngrowth the films were rinsed with de-ionised water and dried  under  a  stream  of  nitrogen.  Post-\npolymerisation cyclic voltammetry and  Electrochemical  Quartz  Crystal  Microbalance  (EQCM)\nstudies were carried out in 0.2 M NaCl with the upper and lower limits being 300  mV  and  -1100\nmV, respectively. Amperometric  sensing  experiments  were  performed  using  a  three-electrode\nelectrochemical cell, which comprised a working electrode  (polypyrrole  film),  a  platinum  mesh\nauxiliary electrode and an Ag\/AgCl reference electrode.\nResults and Discussion\nFollowing sulfonation of the SWNTs, the  functionalised  nanotubes  were  incorporated  into  Ppy\nduring  electrodeposition  and  the  electrochemical  properties   of   the   resultant   material   were\ndetermined. The electrodeposition behaviour  and  electrochemical  properties  after  growth  were\ncompared to those observed with  either  para  toluene  sulfonate  (pTS)  or  polystyrene  sulfonate\n(PSS) as dopant.\n1  Formation  and  characterisation  of  sulfonated  single  wall  carbon   nanotubes\n(SWNT-PhSO3Na)\nThe procedure described by Dyke for the functionalisation of SWNTs using diazonium  chemistry\nwas followed, employing sulfanilic acid as the 4-substituted aniline (Scheme  1)14.  This  reaction\nproduced single wall carbon nanotubes in which 1 in 32 carbons were functionalised by  a  phenyl\nsulfonate group according to thermogravimetric analysis  (TGA,  22%  weight  loss  of  functional\ngroups), with a sulphur  content  of  5.6  %  as  determined  by  elemental  analysis.  This  ratio  of\nfunctionalisation compares well to that previously documented by Dyke14.\nThe Raman spectrum of the starting raw SWNT material shows a small disorder band (D band)  at\n1320 cm-1 (Figure 1) as expected due to the manufacturer\u2019s acidic purification  treatment,  whereas\nthe spectrum of SWNT-PhSO3Na shows a significant increase in the disorder mode relative to  the\ntangential mode (G-band at  1590  cm-1).  This  increase  in  intensity  of  the  D  band  indicates  a\nsignificant conversion of sp2 hybridised carbons in the nanotubes  to  sp3,  consistent  with  a  high\ndegree  of  functionalisation[?].  There  is  also  a  change  in  the  radial  breathing  modes  of   the\nfunctionalised nanotubes when compared to  the  as-received  SWNTs,  which  is  consistent  with\nsidewall functionalisation[?].\nThe  functionalised  SWNTs   (SWNT-PhSO3Na),   although   not   water   soluble,   were   readily\ndispersed in water, without the need for sonication. SWNT-PhSO3Na also  dispersed  sparingly  in\nethanol and isopropanol, poorly in 1,2-dichloroethane and DMF, and not at all in DMPU or  THF.\nThis contrasts greatly with the SWNT starting material.\nThe conductivity of bucky paper formed from the SWNT-PhSO3Na material was measured  to  be\n4.4 \u00b1 0.9 S cm-1, using the standard four point  probe  method.  This  is  two  orders  of  magnitude\nlower than has been reported for single wall carbon nanotubes (that had  not  been  functionalised)\nin a bucky paper format[?]. The loss of  electrical  conductivity  of  the  functionalised  SWNTs  is\nattributed to a high degree of side-wall functionalisation. Measurements of the  ionic  conductivity\nof a solution of SWNT-PhSO3Na (30 mg SWNT-PhSO3Na in 10 ml H2O) gave a value of 2.07 \u00b5S\ncm-1.\n2 Incorporation of sulfonated tubes during Ppy synthesis\nThe electrochemical growth and deposition of Ppy on gold-coated  mylar,  gold-coated  ITO-glass\nand gold-coated quartz crystals was carried out under galvanostatic conditions at a current  density\nof 0.25 mA cm-2 in the presence of SWNT-PhSO3Na (0.3% w\/v) or  pTS  (Figure  2).  In  order  to\ndetermine the effect of pyrrole concentration, solutions containing 0.2 M  or  1.0  M  pyrrole  were\nemployed. A notable feature of the chronopotentiograms in Figure 2 is that  the  use  of  either  the\nsulfonated nanotubes or PSS reduced the potential for Ppy deposition by over 150 mV, from > 0.6\nV in the case of pTS, to <0.45 V (Figure 2). Note also that the potential monitored  during  growth\nwith  pTS,  PSS  or  the  carbon  nanotubes  present  did  not  increase,  indicating  formation  of  a\nconducting deposit.\nUsing EQCM it was found that during deposition with either pTS (Figure 2a) or PSS  (Figure  2b)\nas  electrolyte,  the  frequency  (mass  deposited)  changed  almost  linearly  with  time.  However,\nemploying  SWNT-PhSO3Na  as  the  electrolyte,  a  rather  curious  change  in   frequency   (mass\ndeposited) was observed. The mass change was as expected only over the first few seconds (albeit\na more rapid  frequency  (mass)  change  than  observed  with  pTS  and  PSS),  it  then  decreased\nslightly even though charge continued to be consumed. It was found that this  behaviour  could  be\novercome by increasing the pyrrole monomer concentration  (Figure  2c)  although  again  a  rapid\ndecrease in frequency (increase in mass) was still observed over  the  initial  stages.  This  may  be\nattributed to several factors: i) depletion of  monomer  in  the  vicinity  of  the  electrode,  ii)  slow\ndiffusion of pyrrole monomer through the nanotube  dispersion  to  the  electrode  surface,  iii)  the\npolymerisation of pyrrole in the presence of SWNT-PhSO3Na results in the  formation  of  a  more\nsoluble\/dispersible product that does not  deposit  on  the  electrode.  In  order  to  overcome  these\neffects  the  use  of  a  higher  concentration,  1.0  M  pyrrole  rather   than   0.2   M   pyrrole,   was\ninvestigated. This did result in more typical polymer deposition profiles being  obtained  from  the\nEQCM. However, the rate of deposition and  the  final  mass  deposited  (final  frequency  change)\nwas still less than when pTS or PSS was used as the dopant. In a further experimental  set  up,  the\nuse of an electrode that was pre-coated with a thin (30 \u00b5m) layer of Ppy-pTS was  considered.  An\nalmost linear change in frequency (mass deposited) with  time  was  observed  when  the  Ppy-pTS\nelectrode was used in conjunction with 1.0 M pyrrole in the deposition bath (Figure 2e). It is  well\nknown that monomer oxidises more readily on deposited polymer than on a bare metal surface.\nWith respect to morphology, the effect of the nanotubes in the Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na film  can  be\nclearly observed using SEM (Figure 3). Small bundles of SWNTs which appear to be coated  with\npolymer are apparent (Figure 3c). There  are  no  discrete  domains,  rather  a  random  network  of\nnanotube bundles. Ppy-pTS films however  have  a  very  different  morphology  (Figure  3a),  and\nappear denser than the Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na films. Ppy-PSS films  have  a  very  smooth  surface\n(Figure 3b), confirming that the nanostructure observed in the Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na films  is  due\nto the presence of the functionalised carbon nanotubes.\nRaman  spectra  obtained  from  Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na  films  (Figure  4)  show  the   presence   of\npolypyrrole and SWNTs. The peaks at 933 cm-1  and  1086  cm-1  have  been  associated  with  the\nbipolaron structure and those at 970 cm-1 and 1059 cm-1 with the polaron  structure8.  The  spectra\nconfirm that after growth the films are in the oxidised state due to the ratio  of  bipolaron:  polaron\nbands (1.07 for Ppy-pTS, 1.05 for Ppy-PSS and 1.13 for Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na).\nThe  UV-spectra  obtained  for  both  Ppy-pTS  and  Ppy-PSS  films  (Figure   5)   are   typical   of\npolypyrrole with peaks at 480 nm corresponding  to  the  polaron\/bipolaron  state  and  a  shoulder\nextending into  the  near-IR  indicative  of  the  free  carrier  tail  in  conducting  polymers[?].  The\nspectrum obtained for Ppy containing the carbon nanotubes and prepared  from  0.2  M  pyrrole  is\nindicative of oligomer formation, with low intensity absorbance bands at 600 nm and  930  nm[?].\nPpy-SWNT-PhSO3Na prepared from 1.0 M pyrrole however shows a peak at 400 nm and a  broad\nshoulder at 890 nm.  This  would  indicate  that  even  for  films  grown  from  1.0  M  pyrrole  the\npolymer is not fully doped.\nElectrical conductivity measurements were carried out on stand-alone  Ppy-pTS  and  Ppy-SWNT-\nPhSO3Na films (prepared from 0.2 M pyrrole) using the standard  four  point  probe  method.  The\nroom temperature conductivities were measured to be 94 \u00b1 17 S cm-1 for Ppy-pTS and 0.5  \u00b1  0.26\nS  cm-1  for  Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na.  This  much  lower  conductivity  is  consistent  with  oligomer\nformation as observed in the UV-spectra. \n3 Electrochemical properties of deposited polymer\nAfter growth, the Ppy films were rinsed in water and then transferred into a 0.2 M  NaCl  solution,\nand cyclic voltammograms recorded. Figure 6 shows the behaviour  of  the  Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na\nfilm when cycled between 0.3 V and -1.0 V. The CV is  typical  of  polypyrrole;  however  several\nimportant differences can be seen between this CV and that for Ppy-pTS.  The  peak  potentials  of\nthe Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na film are more  negative  than  those  of  the  Ppy-pTS  film.  The  output\ncurrent of the Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na film is  three  times  higher  than  that  of  the  Ppy-pTS  film,\nprobably due to the capacitive nature of the SWNTs incorporated within the film. The capacitance\nof all the Ppy films was calculated to be 18 mF cm-2 for Ppy-PSS and  30  mF  cm-2  for  Ppy-pTS,\nwhile the capacitance of the Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na film was at least three times  higher  at  90  mF\ncm-2.\nIn order to confirm that  SWNT-PhSO3Na  had  indeed  doped  the  polymer,  post-polymerisation\ncyclic voltammetry was carried out on the composite film using  EQCM.  Polypyrrole  films  were\nprepared  from  0.2  M  pyrrole  with  PSS,  pTS  or  SWNT-PhSO3Na  as  counterions.  PSS  is   a\npolyelectrolyte that is expected to behave in a similar manner to SWNT-PhSO3Na, whereas pTS is\na much smaller anion, which is free to leave the polymer matrix. Upon oxidation and reduction  of\nPpy-pTS, mass changes corresponding to both chloride anion and sodium cation  movement  were\nseen as expected (not shown).\nWith  PSS  as  counterion,  a  mass  increase   upon   reduction   of   Ppy   was   obtained,   with   a\ncorresponding mass decrease upon oxidation (see Figure 7a). This  can  be  explained  by  the  fact\nthat  the  movement  of  positively  charged  sodium   ions   into   the   polymer   predominates   in\nneutralising the  excess  anionic  sulfonate  groups  on  the  immobile  PSS  dopant  upon  polymer\nreduction. During oxidation the mass decreased due to expulsion of the sodium cations.\nIn  an  analogous  fashion,  a  mass  decrease  was  observed  upon  oxidation  of  the  Ppy-SWNT-\nPhSO3Na film, with a mass increase seen upon  reduction  (Figure  7b).  In  contrast,  Ppy-SWNT-\nPhSO3Na prepared from 1.0 M pyrrole is not doped, as evidenced by the mixed  anion  and  cation\nmovement during cyclic voltammetry with in situ QCM measurements (Figure  8a).  With  respect\nto the two layered film structure prepared from 1.0 M pyrrole,  a  similar  trend  emerged,  (Figure\n8c).\n4 Incorporating Enzyme into Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na film for use in Biosensing\nThe low polymerisation potential observed for pyrrole in the presence of SWNT-PhSO3Na  led  us\nto investigate the possibility of trapping biomolecules [horse  radish  peroxidase  (HRP)]  into  the\npolypyrrole-CNT  matrix.  This  was  achieved  during  polymer  synthesis  and   the   use   of   the\nbiocomposite  for  biosensing  was  then  investigated.  The  concentration  of  HRP  and   SWNT-\nPhSO3Na   in   the   polymerisation   solution   was   0.02%   and   0.3%   respectively   w\/v.    The\npolymerisation was carried out galvanostatically  at  a  current  density  of  0.25  mA  cm-2  for  15\nminutes on gold mylar. Polymerisation of pyrrole in the presence  of  SWNT-PhSO3Na  and  HRP\noccurred at a slightly higher potential than with SWNT-PhSO3Na alone. This may  be  due  to  the\ninsulating nature of the enzyme, which increased  the  resistance  of  the  polymerisation  solution.\nThe post polymerisation cyclic voltammogram of the Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na-HRP film  in  sodium\nchloride solution was identical to a Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na film without  HRP.  The  absolute  mass\nof the enzyme  immobilised  within  the  Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na-HRP  film  was  determined  by  a\ncolorimetric enzyme assay15, [?], and was calculated to be 2.6 x  1010  molecules.  In  comparison,\npolypyrrole prepared under identical conditions but with PSS  as  dopant  and  without  electrolyte\nhad 2.3 x 1010 and 2.0 x 1010 HRP molecules immobilised respectively.\nThe  amperometric  (EP  =  -100  mV  vs.  Ag\/AgCl)  response  of  Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na-HRP  in\nphosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) to the addition of 2 mmol  dm-3  H2O2  is  shown  in  Figure  9.\nUpon addition of H2O2, the current increased sharply by 83\u00b5A cm-2. The  response  obtained  from\nthe Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na-HRP film  confirms  the  electrochemical  activity  of  HRP  which  was\nimmobilised within the polypyrrole matrix. In comparison, the current response to  H2O2  obtained\nfrom a Ppy-HRP film, prepared under identical conditions but  with  PSS  as  dopant  and  without\nadditional electrolyte was 37 \u00b5A cm-2 and 3\u00b5A cm-2 respectively. This result, in  conjunction  with\nthe results from the colorimetric enzyme assay,  show  that  the  presence  of  SWNT-PhSO3Na  as\nelectrolyte during the polymerisation of pyrrole, allows the incorporation of  more  active  enzyme\nmolecules than with traditional polyelectrolytes, or without supporting electrolyte.\nConclusion\nIt  has  been  shown  that  pyrrole  may  be  electrochemically  polymerised   in   the   presence   of\nsulfonated  single  wall  carbon  nanotubes  as  dopant  ion.  Unusual   deposition   behaviour   was\nevidenced,  which  is  likely  due  to  limited  diffusion  of  the  monomer  through   the   nanotube\ndispersion  and  the  polyelectrolyte  nature   of   the   functionalised   carbon   nanotubes.   Pyrrole\npolymerisation employing functionalised  nanotubes  as  the  electrolyte  and  dopant  results  in  a\ncomposite  material  comprised  of  mostly  polypyrrole   oligomers;   as   a   result   the   electrical\nconductivity  of  the  composite  is  reduced.  The  polymerisation  of  pyrrole  in  the  presence  of\nfunctionalised nanotubes occurred at a potential lower than for more traditional  electrolytes.  This\nreduction of polymerisation potential has enabled the formation of a  higher  activity  horse  radish\nperoxidase polymer composite than can be  formed  with  traditional  polyelectrolytes,  or  without\nsupporting electrolyte.\n[pic]\nScheme 1: The preparation  of  SWNTs  functionalised  with  phenyl  sodium  sulfonate  (SWNT-\nPhSO3Na) using sulfanilic acid and nitrous acid.\nFigure 1: Raman spectra of raw SWNT and SWNT-PhSO3Na. \n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\nFigure  2:  Chronopotentiograms  of  polypyrrole  growth  and  deposition  monitored  by  EQCM\n(a) Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na (0.2 M pyrrole),  (b)  Ppy-PSS  (0.2  M  pyrrole),  (c)  Ppy-pTS  (0.2  M\npyrrole), (d) Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na (1.0 M pyrrole) and (e) Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na (1.0 M  pyrrole)\non a pre-formed Ppy-pTS layer.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 3: SEM images of (a) Ppy-pTS, (b) Ppy-PSS and (c) Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na.\nFigure 4: Raman spectra of Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na, Ppy-PSS and Ppy-pTS.\nFigure 5: UV spectra  of  Ppy-PSS,  Ppy-pTS  and  Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na  prepared  from  0.2  M\npyrrole, and Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na prepared from 1.0 M pyrrole, all grown on gold coated-ITO.\nFigure 6: Cyclic voltammograms of Ppy-pTS, Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na and Ppy-PSS films  on  gold\ncoated quartz crystals at a scan rate of 20 mV s-1 in 0.2 M NaCl.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 7: Cyclic voltammetric (grey) and EQCM response (black) of (a) Ppy-PSS (0.2 M pyrrole)\nand (b) Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na (0.2 M pyrrole) in 0.2 M NaCl, scan rate 20 mV s-1.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 8: Cyclic voltammetric (grey) and EQCM response (black) of (a) Ppy- SWNT-PhSO3Na\n(1.0 M pyrrole) (b) Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na (0.2 M pyrrole) on a preformed Ppy-pTS film and\n(c) Ppy-SWNT-PhSO3Na (1.0 M pyrrole) on a preformed Ppy-pTS film in 0.2 M NaCl, scan rate\n20 mV s-1.\nFigure 9: Amperometric response of  polypyrrole  films  with  HRP  and  various  dopants  in  the\npolymerisation solution, to H2O2.
