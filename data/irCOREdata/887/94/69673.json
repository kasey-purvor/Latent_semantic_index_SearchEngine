Introduction.39\nParticulate air pollutants have been found to be strongly associated with 40\nadverse effects on respiratory health (e.g. Knox, 2006; Knutsen et al. 2004, Schwartz, 41\n1996; Pope et al., 2002).  The degree of hazard depends principally on the site of 42\nparticulate deposition within the lungs, in turn reflecting the size, shape and density of 43\nthe particulates, and their effects on biological tissue, determined by the composition 44\nof the particles.  Ultrafine particles (< 2.5 \uf06dm, PM2.5) can be deposited deep within the 45\npulmonary region of the human respiratory tract when inhaled, with potential 46\nbioavailability maximised by the large number and surface area of such particles.   If 47\nthese particulates reach the alveoli, inflammation and diminished pulmonary function 48\ncan be incurred (e.g. Knutsen et al., 2004; Seaton et al., 1995).  Links with lung 49\ncancer (Pope et al., 2002; Beeson et al., 1998) and increased cardiovascular mortality 50\n3rates (Pope et al., 1995; Schwartz et al., 1996) have also been established.  Large 51\nproportions of such ultrafine particles are known to be emitted by vehicles (e.g. 52\nMaricq, 1999), with diesel-powered vehicles producing several orders of magnitude 53\nmore PM2.5 particles than petrol-driven ones (Rudell et al., 1999; Maricq, 1999; Wang 54\net al., 2003). In terms of composition, analysis of urban anthropogenic particulates has 55\nshown them to be enriched in a range of potentially toxic trace metals, including Fe, 56\nPb, Zn, Ba, Mn, Cd and Cr (Huhn et al., 1995; Harrison & Jones, 1995).  Keyser et al. 57\n(1978) reported that Pb and Cr from vehicle exhausts are preferentially associated 58\nwith particle surfaces, possibly as a result of condensation from the vapour phase or 59\nadsorption from solution.  Urban anthropogenic particulates also contain, almost 60\ninvariably, magnetic particles (e.g. Hunt et al., 1984; Flanders, 1994; Morris et al., 61\n1995; Matzka & Maher, 1999; Petrovsky & Ellwood, 1999).   These derive from the 62\npresence of iron impurities in fuels, which form upon combustion a non-volatile 63\nresidue, often a mix of strongly magnetic (magnetite-like) and weakly magnetic 64\n(haematite-like) iron oxides. Magnetite has been identified specifically as a 65\ncombustion-derived component of vehicle exhaust materials (Abdul-Razzaq & 66\nGautam, 2001). 67\nQuantitatively, the health risks of urban metal particulates are poorly 68\nunderstood, due to a combination of confounding factors and the relatively low spatial 69\nresolution of the data available for pollutant exposure.  However, Pb is a significant 70\nneurotoxin, posing some health risk even at levels previously considered safe, 71\nparticularly with regard to brain and kidney damage, hearing impairment and 72\ndiminished cognitive development in children (Koller et al., 2004; Lanphear et al., 73\n2000; Needleman & Landrigan, 2004).  High levels of many other trace metals are 74\nimplicated in lung disease and central nervous system disorders (e.g. Colls, 2002), 75\n4ranging from learning disorders to dementia and possibly even Alzheimers\u2019s disease 76\n(Calder\u00f3n-Garcidue\u00f1as et al., 2004).  Aggressive removal of lead from environmental 77\nsources, especially petrol and paints, has resulted in major reductions in lead 78\npoisoning of children.  However, many urban areas still exhibit damagingly high 79\nblood lead levels (i.e. > 5\uf06dg\/dl) in children (e.g. Koller et al., 2004; Lanphear et al., 80\n2000; Mathee et al. 2002). In a study in the Indianapolis area, resuspended soil dust, 81\nenriched with lead from previous decades of leaded fuel usage, was the suspected 82\nmajor source, in light of higher blood lead levels at the urban roadside and seasonal 83\npeaks (summer and winter) in blood lead (Filippelli et al.,  2005). 84\nMagnetic biomonitoring (Matka & Maher, 1999) may provide a robust and 85\ncost-effective means both to gain significantly enhanced spatial resolution for 86\npollutant data, and test proposed metal source\/health linkages.  The deposition of 87\npollution particles on tree leaf surfaces has been shown to result in easily measurable 88\nmagnetic properties, including magnetic remanence (i.e. the magnetization remaining 89\nafter a sample has been placed in and then removed from an applied dc field) and 90\nmagnetic susceptibility (the magnetization induced when the sample is placed in a 91\nsmall - ~ twice the Earth\u2019s magnetic field \u2013 dc field).  Leaves are potentially efficient 92\nreceptors and biomonitors of particulate pollution, as they provide a large total surface 93\nfor particle collection, numbers of samples and sample sites can be high (i.e. 100s), 94\nand, in pollution contexts, the leaves themselves are insignificantly magnetic. Tree 95\nleaves also preclude sampling problems associated with use of artificial particle 96\ncollectors (including power requirements, noise, and vulnerability to vandalism).  To 97\nensure comparability of results, tree leaves of the same tree species, and similar age, 98\ncan be used. For a number of industrial sites in N. Germany, Schadlich et al. (1995) 99\nfound strong correlation between the magnetic susceptibility of pine needles and their 100\n5Fe content, as a result of deposition of fly ash particles.  For a relatively small city 101\nwith little industry (Norwich, U.K.; population ~100,000), Matzka & Maher (1999) 102\nfound minimal values of magnetic remanence for birch leaves in parks within the city 103\ncentre but increasingly high values for trees located at the roadside, and significantly 104\nhigher values both for the road-proximal side of the tree and for trees growing on the 105\nuphill side of road lanes.  These authors estimated the grain size of magnetic particles 106\nfrom vehicle emissions to be of the order of 0.3 \u2013 3 \uf06dm, a size of particular potential 107\nhazard to health.  Subsequent studies (e.g. Muxworthy et al., 2002; Moreno et al., 108\n2003; Hanesch et al., 2003; Gautam et al. 2005) have confirmed that, in the absence of 109\nheavy industry, traffic pollution is the main source of magnetic particles on leaves.  110\nHere, we report new data from the Norwich magnetic biomonitoring study, 111\nwith the aim of evaluating if magnetic biomonitoring can be used as a robust 112\nsurrogate for identifying the source and concentrations of toxic trace metals, 113\nespecially Pb.  114\n115\n2. Methods.116\nOver an 8-day, predominantly dry summer period, 100s of leaves were 117\nsampled from the most abundant urban tree in Norwich, the birch (Betula pendula).  118\nFollowing Matzka & Maher\u2019s original (1999) study, samples were taken from Grapes 119\nHill, a dual carriageway with a 12 o gradient, part of the city\u2019s inner ring road.  120\nAround 30,000 vehicles use this road each day (Norwich City Council, 1995).  Birch 121\ntrees are planted in pairs along the central reservation area, providing uphill-adjacent 122\nand downhill-adjacent trees.  Each sample consisted of six leaves, sampled from the 123\nouter canopy at a height of 1.5 m; the oldest leaves from the newest twig growth were 124\nsampled, in order to ensure leaves of similar age and exposure time.  In addition, leaf 125\n6samples were taken from one of the Grapes Hill birch trees at 30 cm intervals, from 126\nthe ground to a maximum height of 2.1 m.  The surface area of the leaves was 127\ncalculated by digitizing their computer-scanned images. Leaves were then packed into 128\n10 cc plastic sample holders for magnetic measurements, at the Centre for 129\nEnvironmental Magnetism and Palaeomagnetism.  Magnetic susceptibility was too 130\nlow to be measurable for any of the samples. All samples were magnetized (at room 131\ntemperature) with incremental, pulsed dc fields of 20, 50, 100 and 300 milliTesla 132\n(mT) and 1 Tesla (T), using a Molspin Pulse Magnetiser.  The resultant isothermal 133\n(i.e. room temperature) magnetic remanences (IRMs) were measured using a 134\ncryogenic magnetometer (CCL Ltd., with a noise level of 10-10 Am2 \u2013 the weakest leaf 135\nsamples had remanences of the order of 10-8 Am2).  A description of environmental 136\nmagnetic parameters and measuring techniques is given in e.g. Maher et al. (1999). 137\nSelected samples were also subjected to af demagnetization; coercivity of magnetic 138\nremanence was determined from the intersection of the IRM acquisition and 139\ndemagnetisation curves (higher values indicating magnetically harder behaviour, in 140\nturn related to magnetic mineralogy and\/or magnetic grain size). 141\nA representative subset of samples was then selected for leaching and 142\nelemental analysis.  The leaves were leached in 25 ml 1 % HNO3 and left in covered 143\nbottles for 72 hours.  Prior to use, all glass and plastic ware was washed with 144\ndetergent, soaked in 1 % HNO3 for 24 hours and rinsed with high-purity \u2018MilliQ\u2019 145\nwater.  The leaves were then recovered and their remanence at 1 T remeasured, in 146\norder to identify the proportion of SIRM removed by the leaching procedure.  Sample 147\nleachates were filtered through 0.2 \uf06dm filters and then analysed by ICPOES (Thermo 148\nJarel Ash Polyscan 61E) for: Fe, Pb, Zn, Mn, Ba, Cd and Cr.  (Elemental limits of 149\ndetection for this instrument are listed in Table 1). For each sample, the magnetic 150\n7remanences and elemental concentrations were normalized for leaf area, giving 151\nmagnetic moment (Am2) per leaf area (m2) \u2013 hence, in units of Amperes (A), and 152\nelemental concentrations in units of \uf06dg\/m2.  Further selected leaf samples were 153\nvacuum-coated in gold and analysed using scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi 154\nSEM S450) and energy-dispersive x ray analysis (EDXA).  A small number of 155\nsamples was placed in plastic bottles with filtered \u2018MilliQ\u2019 water and treated 156\nultrasonically, to remove surface particulates. The suspensate was then sampled for 157\nanalysis using transmission electron microscopy (JEOL 100CX). Finally, air filter 158\nsamples were obtained from the background site (200 m3 of air sampled) and the 159\nclosest possible site to the roadside (150 m3 of air sampled, within 500 m of the 160\nroadside), using a high-volume air sampler, and SIRM measurements made of the 161\nfilters. 162\n163\n3. Results.164\nFigure 1 shows the spatial variation in birch leaf magnetic values across the 165\nurban-rural gradient, with very low SIRMs measured for leaves sampled from the 166\nNorfolk coast and increasingly high values obtained for leaves with increasing 167\nproximity to the roadside. For the leaves sampled over an  8-day summer period from 168\nGrapes Hill, a major dual carriageway close to the Norwich city centre, the average, 169\nleaf area-normalised (2-D) SIRM value (i.e. the remanence acquired at the maximum 170\napplied dc field, 1 T) was 48.5 10-6 A (minimum = 27.5 10-6 A, maximum = 96.1 10-6171\nA).  This compares with a background value (from trees sampled at a parkland site) of 172\n3.6 10-6 A (Table 1).  Most of the leaf magnetic remanence was acquired at low 173\napplied dc fields, indicating the presence of magnetically soft, magnetite-like (Fe3O4) 174\nmaterial. A small proportion of the remanence (< 5 % of the SIRM) was acquired at 175\n8fields beyond 300 mT, indicating the additional (and possibly volumetrically more 176\nimportant) presence of magnetically \u2018hard\u2019 minerals, such as haematite (\uf061Fe2O3). 177\nCoercivity values for the roadside leaves varied over a narrow range, from 42 \u2013 46 178\nmT, slightly higher than for the background samples, which displayed lower and 179\nslightly more variable values, 35 \u2013 42 mT.  The magnetic data indicate that the180\ndominant size of the magnetic particles is between  ~1 \u2013 0.1 \uf06dm.  181\nTo examine the spatial variations in roadside SIRM and metal values, leaves 182\nwere collected from two birch trees within the central reservation, i.e. between the 183\nuphill and downhill lanes of the Grapes Hill dual carriageway (fig. 2) following the 184\napproach described by Matzka & Maher (1999).  As reported previously by Matzka & 185\nMaher (1999), SIRM values were again always highest for samples from both sides of 186\nthe uphill-adjacent tree, with slightly lower values for the road-proximal side of the 187\ndownhill-adjacent tree and lowest values for the distal side of the downhill-adjacent 188\ntree (fig. 2b).  189\nFor the leaf leachates (Table 1), Zn and Fe were found to show the highest 190\nroadside concentrations, with Mn, Ba and Pb at lower levels, and Cd and Cr below 191\ntheir detection limits at all sampled sites.  Background values for Fe and Pb were 192\nminimal (11 \uf06dg\/m2 and below detection, respectively), in major contrast to the Grapes 193\nHill roadside sites, where Fe values averaged 427 \uf06dg\/m2 (max. = 983 \uf06dg\/m2), with an 194\naverage enhancement factor of x 39, and Pb values averaged 29 \uf06dg\/m2 (max. = 81 195\n\uf06dg\/m2, indetectable at background). Of the other analysed elements, Zn, Mn and Ba 196\nall displayed significant concentrations even at the background sites (~ 119, 81 and 54 197\n\uf06dg\/m2, respectively).  Their enhancement factors at the roadside were thus 198\ncorrespondingly lower, at x 4, x 3 and x 1.5, respectively (Table 1). Demonstrating the199\neffectiveness of the analytical procedures, remagnetisation of a subset of leaf samples 200\n9after the leaching process showed that it had removed ~ 75 % of the original magnetic 201\nremanence; the acid leach treatment (1 % HNO3) is reported to remove up to 80 % of 202\ntotal Pb, Zn and Cd (Little, 1973).  203\nThus, compared with the \u2018background\u2019, parkland site, the leaf SIRM, Pb and204\nFe values show the greatest roadside enrichment.  Lower roadside enrichment factors 205\nare evident for Zn, Mn and Ba, reflecting their significant concentrations even at the 206\n\u2018background\u2019 greenfield site. In terms of spatial variations across the Grapes Hill dual 207\ncarriageway, Fe and Pb concentrations display very similar patterns to the leaf SIRM 208\nvalues, being highest at the uphill-proximal sample site (fig. 2c and d).  Zn, Mn and 209\nBa values display greater spatial variation than Fe and Pb, with some maximal values 210\nassociated with the downhill-proximal samples.  Leaf SIRM and metal values were 211\nreduced (by between ~ 5 to 30 %) after a rainstorm event (the night of the second 212\nsampling day), before subsequently increasing once more in the following dry 213\nweather conditions.  Table 2 shows the correlation coefficients (R2 values) for the 214\nmeasured leaf SIRM values and the elemental concentrations from the leaf leachates.  215\nVery strong correlation is evident between the SIRM and concentrations of Fe (R2 = 216\n0.976, n = 40, p = < 0.05) and Pb (R2 = 0.871).  Significant albeit weaker correlation 217\n(R2 = 0.4 \u2013 0.5) exists between the measured Zn, Mn and Ba concentrations. No 218\nsignificant correlation exists between this group and the SIRM, Pb, Fe group.  219\nAnalysis of roadside leaves sampled at different heights showed that leaf 220\nparticulate Pb, Fe and SIRM concentrations reached peak values at ~ 0.3 m and 1.5 \u2013221\n2 m above ground level (figure 3).  In contrast, Zn, Ba and Mn displayed lowest 222\nvalues at 0.3 m height, and steadily increased in concentration with height, indicating223\n(together with their higher background values) a more pervasive distribution of these 224\nmetals.  The results were replicated over several days of sampling.  225\n10\nScanning and transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and energy-226\ndispersive x ray analysis (EDXA), were applied to pollutant particles washed from the 227\nsampled birch leaves from Grapes Hill.  Two types of particle morphology were most 228\nfrequently observed: clusters of spheres (cooled droplets), ranging in size from ~ 20 229\n\uf06dm to < 0.5 \uf06dm (figure 5), and angular particles, between 1 and 10 \uf06dm in length. 230\nEnergy-dispersive x ray analysis of the spheres identified their major elements as Fe, 231\nSi and Al, with varying concentrations of minor elements, including Mn, K, Ca and 232\nPb.  Notably, Pb appeared to be associated only with the smallest spherules, < ~ 1 \uf06dm. 233\nThe angular particles were Fe-rich, some particles also containing S, Al, K and Ca.  234\nMinor numbers of fine, irregular particles (~ 1 \uf06dm diameter) were also observed, 235\ndominantly containing Ba, S and Mn.  Finally, large conglomerates of particles (> 50 236\n\uf06dm diameter) were also observed, dominantly consisting of Al, K, Ca and Si; such 237\nparticles are most likely of natural origin, probably soil-derived dust.  Notably, few of 238\nthe analysed particles revealed the presence of zinc, even for leaf samples at sites 239\nwhere the measured levels of Fe and Zn were comparable.  Zinc oxide particles 240\nderived from rubber dust have been shown to occur as ovoid particles of < 0.5 \uf06dm 241\n(McCrone & Delly, 1973) - such particles would be resolvable under TEM. The 242\nparticles analysed here by STEM and EDXA were obtained by washing and ultrasonic 243\ndispersion of the leaf surfaces; the absence of Zn-containing particles in these 244\nsuspensates but their presence in the acid leachates suggests significant incorporation 245\nwithin the leaf cell structure by foliar penetration through the guard cells and cuticle 246\n(Little, 1973).247\nFinally, in order to check how representative the tree leaves are as pollution 248\ncollectors, samples were also collected using a high volume air sampler, adjacent to a 249\nroundabout at the top of the monitored dual carriageway and at the background site.  250\n11\nThe sample nearest to the roadside gave rise to 3 x higher magnetic values per m3251\nsampled air than the background site, and its magnetic properties matched those of the 252\nmeasured tree leaves. 253\n254\n4. Discussion255\nRoadside tree leaves in this UK city exhibit significant enhancement in their 256\nvalues of SIRM, Fe and Pb, reflecting surface accumulation of particulate pollutants, 257\ncompared with leaves growing at a background, parkland site.  In contrast, much more 258\nlimited roadside enhancement is shown by the metal group, Zn, Mn and Ba.  At high 259\nspatial resolution, maximal and strongly correlated Pb, Fe and SIRM values are 260\ndisplayed by roadside tree leaves adjacent to uphill rather than downhill lanes.  This 261\nassociation between pollutant loading and road gradient indicates fuel combustion is 262\nthe major pollutant source; these patterns would not arise from resuspension of 263\nroadside dust (Filippelli et al., 2005) or from tyre, brake or other vehicle wear. The264\ncorrelation between the SIRM values and leaf Pb concentrations is even stronger than 265\nthat observed between Pb and Fe.  This suggests that Pb is strongly source-associated 266\nwith the magnetic Fe particulates, which arise from vehicle combustion\/exhaust 267\nprocesses, and less associated with more weakly magnetic phases either of natural 268\norigin and\/or from vehicle ablation or abrasion.  The strong link between SIRM and 269\nPb could reflect coprecipitation of Pb during magnetite genesis (i.e. during 270\ncombustion) and\/or subsequent adsorption of Pb on the surface of the combustion-271\nformed magnetic grains.  Olson & Skogerboe (1975) previously reported that lead 272\nemitted from vehicle exhausts occurs primarily in particulate form.  This present-day 273\nco-association of significant levels of automotive Pb and magnetic Fe emissions is 274\nevident despite the introduction of unleaded petrol (in the UK, since 1986).  Possible, 275\n12\nnon-fuel, sources of Pb which could give rise to these ongoing, combustion-related 276\nemissions include lead plating of fuel tanks, and lead in vulcanised fuel hoses, piston 277\ncoatings, valve seats and spark plugs. Pb is a significant neurotoxin, posing some 278\nhealth risk at any level of exposure, particularly with regard to brain and kidney 279\ndamage, hearing impairment and cognitive development in children.  Given the high 280\ncorrelation coefficients between SIRM and Pb, SIRM values (measurements made 281\neasily, rapidly and cheaply) appear valuable as a robust proxy predictor, and capable 282\nof providing unprecedentedly high spatial resolution data, for this toxic pollutant.283\nStrong correlation also exists between SIRM and Fe content for the Grapes 284\nHill roadside sites, confirming the ferrimagnetic nature of much of the particulate Fe.  285\nBased on the strong, direct linear relationship between SIRM and Fe concentration at 286\nthe roadside, when SIRM = 0, the Fe concentration = 52 +\/- 40 \uf06dg\/m2. For the 287\nsuburban \u2018background\u2019 site, the Fe concentration on sampled leaves was 11 \uf06dg \/m2.  288\nThis suggests that much of the \u2018non-magnetic\u2019 Fe at the Grapes Hill sites is also 289\npollution-derived, from surface reception of non-magnetic iron compounds (e.g. 290\nabraded rust particles).  However, the \u2018non-magnetic\u2019 portion of the roadside Fe 291\ncontent is only 11 % of the total.  292\nBackground levels of Zn, Mn and Ba are much higher than those for Fe and 293\nPb, resulting in enrichment ratios at the roadside of only 1.6 \u2013 4 (compared with x 43 294\nand \u221e for Fe and Pb, respectively). The height distribution of the Zn, Mn and Ba 295\ngroup, displaying increased elemental concentrations with height (up to the maximum 296\nsampled height, 2.1 m), is again in contrast with the SIRM, Pb and Fe distributions, 297\nwhich peak at ~ 0.3 m, with a subsidiary peak ~ 1.5 \u2013 2 m height. These data suggest 298\nthat more pervasive, broader-scale atmospheric deposition processes are of 299\nimportance for ambient Zn, Mn and Ba levels. However, they do display some limited 300\n13\ndegree of roadside enrichment and significant (albeit weaker) correlation between 301\nthem suggests some source association. The absence of correlation between the 302\nSIRM, Fe and Pb data and the Zn, Mn, Ba group indicates different, non exhaust-303\nrelated sources for the latter at the Grapes Hill site.  Across the dual carriageway, their 304\nspatial variations are less systematic than those of Fe and Pb, but there is some 305\nevidence of enhancement at the downhill-proximal sample site, suggesting braking 306\nand tyre wear as significant sources. Huhn et al. (1995) have identified vehicle brake 307\nand tyre wear as possible sources of Zn.  Additionally, Ba is added to diesel fuel as a 308\nsmoke suppressant and Mn is used as an anti-knock agent (Huhn et al., 1995).309\nThe peak SIRM, Pb and Fe values at ~ 0.3 m height are likely to reflect 310\nexhaust-derived particulate emissions but it is possible that leaf drip from higher parts 311\nof the canopy may make a contribution.  Local weather conditions, rainsplash, and the 312\naerodynamic properties of the tree and its canopy, may also play a role in the height-313\ndistribution of particulate deposition.  As raindrops contain particles collected from 314\nthe atmosphere, they may contribute either to the accumulation of dust on leaf315\nsurfaces or, by detaching previously collected particles, to its reduction. Here, rainfall 316\nevents led to reductions in the measured leaf SIRM and metal concentrations, whilst 317\ndry conditions were associated with cumulative increases in leaf pollutant loadings. 318\nThis suggests that the main physical process responsible for particulate deposition is319\nimpaction.  Due to their inertia and\/or density, particles cannot follow the air flow 320\naround the leaves and consequently impact or sediment upon them (QUARG, 1996).  321\nDeposited particles must also resist possible resuspension by turbulence; smaller 322\nparticles may penetrate more deeply into less exposed areas of the leaf surface 323\n(Kinnersley et al., 1996).324\n14\nFor the metals analysed here, the highest roadside concentrations were found 325\nfor Fe (mean = 427 \uf06dg \/m2, max. = 742 \uf06dg \/m2) and Zn (mean = 468 \uf06dg \/m2 , max. = 326\n968 \uf06dg \/m2), both metal pollutants thought to be implicated in generating pulmonary 327\ninflammation (e.g. Aust et al., 2002; Samet et al., 1998). Notably, even with Zn 328\nloadings as high as here, the sampled leaves themselves showed no visible signs of 329\ndamage (a finding similar to that reported previously by Little, 1973). 330\n331\nWe can use the strong, direct correlation between Pb and SIRM to estimate Pb 332\nloadings per m3 of air at this roadside. At the mean SIRM kerbside enhancement ratio 333\nof 16 x background, roadside Pb levels equate to 13 ng\/m3; at the maximum SIRM 334\nenhancement, the Pb concentration is 25 ng\/m3.  These estimated Pb concentrations 335\nare comparable with levels recorded by the U.K.\u2019s Air Quality Network for locations 336\nincluding Manchester and Swansea. Critically, however, we show here that the 337\nvehicle-derived Pb is associated with ultrafine (< 1 \uf06dm) magnetic particulates.  Such 338\nultrafine grains, comprising very large particle numbers (~ 106 \u2013109 \/ \uf06dg), pose 339\ngreatest health hazard.  Their deposition in the lung may overwhelm the capacity of 340\nmacrophages to engulf and remove them, leading to prolonged tissue contact times 341\nand resultant inflammation, whilst their high surface area also enhances their potential 342\nfor bioavailability (Donaldson, 2003). That roadside lead emissions are bioavailable is 343\nindicated by reports of increased 210Pb-supported 210Po on the outer enamel of 344\npermanent teeth in children living in proximity to (< 10 km) and downwind from 345\nmajor UK motorways (Henshaw et al., 1995; James et al., 2004). Further, interactions 346\nbetween Fe-rich particles and epithelial tissues are suggested to generate free radicals, 347\nleading to oxidative cell damage (Aust et al., 2002).  Ultrafine particulates are likely 348\nto pose a particular hazard to small children, doubly vulnerable because of 349\n15\ndevelopmental health impacts and the measured peak in particulates at low heights, ~ 350\n0.3 m above ground (the secondary peak in Pb, Fe and SIRM values is close to head 351\nheight for most adults). Exposure may occur both at the roadside and\/or within the 352\npassenger cab of vehicles using the road.353\n354\nConclusions355\n\uf0b7 Urban roadside tree leaves exhibit significant enhancement in their 356\nvalues of SIRM, Fe and Pb, reflecting surface accumulation of 357\nparticulate pollutants, compared with leaves growing at a background, 358\nparkland site.  Much more limited roadside enhancement is shown by 359\nthe metal group, Zn, Mn and Ba.  360\n361\n\uf0b7 Maximal (and strongly correlated) Pb, Fe and SIRM values are 362\ndisplayed by roadside tree leaves adjacent to uphill rather than 363\ndownhill lanes.  This association between pollutant loading and road 364\ngradient indicates vehicle fuel combustion as the major source for 365\nthese pollutants, rather than resuspension of roadside dust or from tyre, 366\nbrake or other vehicle wear.367\n368\n\uf0b7 The vehicle-derived Pb appears strongly associated with ultrafine (< 1 369\n\uf06dm) magnetic particulates.  Such ultrafine grains, contributing very 370\nlarge particle numbers (~ 106 \u2013109 \/\uf06dg) and optimal bioavailability, 371\npose greatest hazard to human health.  372\n373\n16\n\uf0b7 Ultrafine particulates pose a particular hazard to small children, doubly 374\nvulnerable because of developmental health impacts and the375\nidentification here of a peak in magnetic, Pb- and Fe-rich particulates 376\nat child height (~ 0.3m above ground).377\n378\n\uf0b7 Given the high correlation coefficients between Pb and leaf magnetic 379\nvalues, easy, rapid and cheap magnetic measurements of roadside 380\nleaves appear valuable as a robust proxy predictor of this toxic 381\npollutant, offering the possibility of greatly enhanced spatial resolution382\nof pollutant datasets, a prerequisite for detailed analysis of possible 383\npollution\/health linkages (Schwarze et al., 2006).384\n385\n\uf0b7 On an immediately practical level, this study suggests first, that 386\npedestrians can reduce their vehicle-derived pollution intake by 387\nwalking on the downhill side of the road, where possible with 388\nintervening trees, and second, that the pollutant-filtering effects of 389\nroadside trees would be significantly enhanced if tree-planting were 390\nincreased and lower-level leaf growth maintained, not removed. 391\n392\n17\nReferences.393\nAbdul-Razzaq, W., Gautam, M., 2001.
