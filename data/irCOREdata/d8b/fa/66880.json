Introduction \nReflecting on the findings of a 1990s focus group research project on lay perceptions of genetic \nengineering (Grove-White et al. 1997), Deane-Drummond and her co-authors (2003) suggest that the \nquestions such work raises are, in many ways, theological ones. In contrast to traditional framings of \npublic concerns about new technology, which centre on a calculation of risk and benefit, they present \npublic controversy around genetic modification (GM), which peaked in the UK in the late 1990s and \nearly 2000s, as fundamentally about ontological and theological questions rather than the more \nfrequently suggested causes of concerns about risk or out-of-control irrationalism. As a development of \nthis they argue for an increased sensitivity in research to the \u201cquality and texture of the actual reactions \nof \u2018ordinary people\u2019\u201d (p.19). Such an approach remains novel in the context of research on public \nresponses to new technologies. After a host of technological controversies, UK science policy has \nwitnessed a renewed interest in understanding \u2018public attitudes\u2019 toward technologies, culminating in an \nofficial commitment to forms of \u2018upstream public engagement\u2019 on these matters (HM Government \n2005; Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering 2004). However, despite high-profile public \nengagement and consultation exercises \u2013 such as GM Nation? and recent debates concerning stem cell \nresearch \u2013 official characterisations of public concerns relating to new technologies are dominated by \nthe assumption that such concerns are irrational and personal, concerned solely with risks or benefits, \nand a product of manipulation by mainstream media.i The suggestion that public controversies have an \nontological \u2013 even theological \u2013 quality and might be understood as a kind of ontological-politics (Mol \n2003), contesting the very meaning of human and non-human life, therefore challenges the received \nunderstanding of the tenor of public concern.  \nIn this paper we seek to explore these dynamics through analysis of a study focussing on another new \nfield of technological endeavour: nanotechnology. As with the 1997 Uncertain World study on GM \n(Grove-White et al. 1997), on which Deane-Drummond et al. draw, there is currently little public \nawareness of nanotechnology, both in the UK and Europe and in the US (Gaskell et al. 2004; Opinion \nLeader 2008; Peter D Hart Research Associates 2007). The technologies which fall into it as a category \n(anything that involves the \u201cunderstanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly one to 100 \nnanometers\u201d, NNI 2004) are, however, rapidly becoming more prevalent in the marketplace, and their \nuse is predicted by some to define the 21st century (Roco 2001). As of July 2008, the Project on Emerging \nNanotechnologies\u2019 Consumer Products Inventoryii listed 610 products based on nanotechnology \ncurrently on the market, from sun cream to music players, up from 580 six months before. A 2007 \nreport by the insurers Lloyds suggests that \u201ccurrent and potential areas of application *of \nnanotechnology] include transport, manufacturing, biomedicine, sensors, environmental management, \nfood technology, information and communications technology, materials, textiles, sports equipment, \ncosmetics, skin care and defence\u201d \u2013 and notes that the list is not exhaustive (Lloyds 2007). \nWith such diverse and potentially world-shaping applications, many have argued that nanotechnologies \nare likely to raise significant social and ethical questions (see Bruce 2006; Kjolberg and Wickson 2007).  \nWhilst these include traditional risk-based concerns \u2013 particularly evident in current debates about the \npossible eco-toxicology of nanomaterials \u2013 contemporary scholarship has demonstrated the potential \n4 \n \nfor nanotechnology to heighten a range of broader socio-political and ethical concerns (Kearnes et al. \n2006b). Recent debates about, for example, GM food, civil nuclear power and stem cell research \ndemonstrate the ways in which technologies have the potential to become the locus for a host of \nconcerns about the face of change, the opacity of official regulatory structures, and the potential for \ntechnologies to transgress hitherto taken-for-granted ethical and theological categories such as those \nbetween the living and the dead, the human and the machine, or the made and unmade (Jasanoff 2005; \n2006; Kearnes et al. 2006a; Macnaghten 2004; 2009).  \nGiven nanotechnology\u2019s potential to intensify these existing yet latent anxieties, the international policy \nconsensus increasingly represents nanotechnology as an opportunity to improve technological \ngovernance, in which lessons can be learned from previous technological controversies such as GM, and \nwhere the technology can develop in \u2018socially robust\u2019 ways (see Kearnes et al. 2006). For example, \nMacnaghten et al. (2005)  analyse the ways in which nanotechnology has been cast as an \u2018opportunity\u2019 \nfor the incorporation of both social science and public deliberation under the expectation that this will \nenable the development of nanotechnology to be more successful. Similarly, Roco and Bainbridge \n(2001), speaking about the formation of the US National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), suggest that \nthe initiative is \u201ca rare opportunity to integrate the societal studies and dialogues from the very \nbeginning and to include societal studies as a core part of the NNI investment strategy\u201d (pp. 2, 10).   \nIf such ambitions are to be realised it seems clear that lay input will be vital. Deane-Drummond et al.\u2019s \n(2003) description of professionalised responses to the \u2018ethics\u2019 of GM notes that these frequently fell far \nshort of the discussions of \u2018ordinary people\u2019 in focus groups, and this gap was, they suggest, one of the \ncauses of the outcry that GM produced (see also Grove-White et al. 2000; Wynne 2003). In this paper \nwe investigate nascent public responses to nanotechnology, drawing on research that deployed an \ninnovative methodology for lay participants to develop their thinking on what might be \u2018at stake\u2019, \nethically, in emerging nanotechnologies. The approach makes a novel contribution to research on public \nattitudes to nanotechnology through its focus on the underlying factors that shape public responses and \nthe repertoire of moral and ethical narratives deployed in such sense-making: we examine not (only) the \n\u2018attitudes\u2019 created towards nanotechnology but the dynamics that shape them and the resources used \nto construct them (Swidler 1986).  \nThe research was conducted through six two-stage focus groups, each convened in the North East of \nEngland and made up of between six and eight (non-scientist) participants from a range of backgrounds. \nGroups were selected around commonalities of lifeworld experience likely to be of relevance in creating \npositions on nanotechnology.iii The initial meetings introduced nanotechnology within the context of \nparticipant experiences of existing technologies, while a subsequent one day workshop attempted to \ndraw out the dilemmas created by the ways in which the future of nanotechnology was being imagined \nwithin public discourse. All of these discussions were moderated by the researchers, and aimed to \nenable thorough and robust conversations around nanotechnology and its implications. The aim of \nthese interventions was to identify implicit and explicit normative positions and arguments developed \nwithin the groups, and the cultural resources drawn upon to create them.  \n5 \n \nIn this article we discuss, relatively briefly, some of the key narratives generated through the research \nprocess (section 3), describing the content of these. While there were strong commonalities between \nour six groups and the stories they told - meaning that it is possible to identify overarching narratives \nused by all of the groups \u2013 we also identified differences in the ways in which common stories were \nhandled as discourse. Our main argument (section 4) focuses on one group in particular, drawn from \nregular attenders at a Durham church. We describe some of the specificities of this group\u2019s discussions \nand argue that their talk can in many ways be seen as exemplary of the themes we describe in section 3. \nThey are, we suggest, able to articulate these stories more readily than other groups because they have \naccess to specific resources of language: using a language of spirituality and relationality they are able to \nexpress shared notions of what nanotechnology threatens (and promises). Given that the dilemmas that \ntechnologies such as nano raise are construed, by lay publics generally, as theological in the sense of \nimpinging upon deeply held intuitions about limits, the sacred, and the nature of humanity, it seems \nthat those publics with ready access to theological languages may be more adept at expressing such \nintuitions. \nWe start, however, by considering briefly how recent discussions around science and religion may help \nframe our analysis. In the next section we describe some general theoretical frameworks as well as \nliterature more specific to nanotechnology.  \n \n2. Theology, technology, and cultures \nDeane-Drummond et al. (2003) argue, in their analysis of focus group data and the GM controversy, that \nclashes between expert and lay perspectives can be understood as two different \u201cimplicit theologies of \nthe person\u201d (p.28) running up against one another: a narrowly reductionist view focussed on \nconsequentialist arguments; and a richer perspective which sought to examine all possible implications, \nin all domains, of scientific modifications of the relationships between persons and natural orders. They \nsuggest, then, that all public responses, not just the overtly \u2018religious\u2019, can be understood as theological \n(and indeed that scientific and policy models can be understood in the same terms). From this they raise \nthe \u201cintriguing possibility\u201d that: \ntheological perspectives may now be indispensable in helping explain to largely secular institutions the \nsources and dynamics of conflicts now threatening to paralyse the development of what is being posited \nas a key technology for the twenty-first century (p.22) \nIt is from religious perspectives, in other words, that analysts may find both explanations of what is \nhappening around \u2018key technologies\u2019 such as GM (and nanotechnology) and \u2013 Deane-Drummond et al. \nlater suggest \u2013 new insights into how these technologies should be managed and developed within \nsocieties.  \nIn the context of research on public responses to new technologies, this suggestion is both novel and \nprovocative. Contemporary analyses of public attitudes to nanotechnology have been dominated by \nquantitative survey research, which purports to examine public \u2018attitudes\u2019 to nanotechnology while \n6 \n \ndisregarding its wider ontological and theological resonances.iv In this quantitative research risk is \npositioned as the key point of issue for publics with regard to new technologies, such that public \nattitudes are understood to be focussed on issues of safety and to involve assessments of the \u2018risks and \nbenefits\u2019 of nanotechnologies (see Bowman and Hodge 2007; Peter D Hart Research Associates 2007). \nThe broader ontological or theological dynamics of the relationship between the public and new \ntechnologies are typically neglected. Despite the novelty of Deane-Drummond et al.\u2019s call \u2013 which at the \nvery least suggests that religious voices may speak with wider resonances than is often imagined \u2013 there \nhave been few attempts to integrate or even understand theological perspectives on new technologies. \nThis is perhaps surprising given a rich body of work theorising the relationships between science, \nreligion and secularism within particular societies. John C Caiazza (2005) has argued, for example, that in \nwestern cultures both revealed religion and scientific knowledge are being replaced by what he calls \ntechno-secularism, through the ubiquity of \u2018magical\u2019 (cf Frazer *1922+ 1995) and black-boxed \ntechnologies. He paints a picture of ruthlessly instrumental and utilitarian \u2018empty\u2019 belief systems (which \nmight, perhaps, be compared with Deane-Drummond et al.\u2019s description of \u2018expert\u2019 theologies). While \nlargely agreeing with this diagnosis of contemporary society and its engagement with magical \ntechnologies, Szerszynski (2005) presents a rather different view of the historicity of these transitions. \nHe argues that the clear cut distinction between the secular and sacred in Caiazza\u2019s (and many other \nanalysts\u2019) writings is misguided: they are products of a shared culture and history, and disagreement is \n\u201cless a matter of talking about different things\u2026than it is of disagreeing about the same thing\u201d (p.817, \nemphasis in original). Secularism, he suggests, can therefore be understood as having its own theology. \nFor Szerszynski, given the shared history and cultural resources of both secularism and theology, \ncontemporary technology is cast as a carrier of theological meaning, ultimately containing a promise of \nsalvation (see also Nye 1994). Accordingly, the emergence of forms of reflexive modernity (Beck 1992; \nSzerszynski 2003) are characterised by a set of transformations in fact taking place within both religion \nand the technical sciences rather than a shift from religion to technology (as Caiazza suggests). Such \nchanges involve a move away from \u201cimpersonal canonical meanings and toward indexical, pragmatic \nsolutions\u201d (Szerszynski 2005, 819). In both religion and technology, then, attention becomes increasingly \nfocussed on the personal and the individual: what this piece of technology can do for me, now; what \nforms of spirituality will help me, here (see Heelas et al. 2004). \nIf Szerszynski\u2019s analysis is correct, laypeople\u2019s experience of technology may not simply be of it as \nmagical but also as religious, relating to the sublime with promises of release from earthly limitations \n(Szerszynski 2005; 2006). This, of course, returns us to Deane-Drummond et al.\u2019s (2003) point: public \nresponses to new technologies are imbued with theological meaning around ontological issues of \npersonhood, natural orders, and right relationships. Indeed, recent public engagement activities have \nindicated that laypeople frequently see new technologies as relating to \u2018the religious\u2019 (Bruce 2007). \nSimilar arguments are made by those who understand lay negotiations of technology as drawing on \ncontextualised cultural resources (which will often include faith backgrounds). Simpson (2004a; 2004b), \nfor example, has described how cultural and religious practices and language provide a rich resource for \nindividuals negotiating new reproductive and genetic technologies in Sri Lanka. He shows how particular \ntechnologies are understood in the light of stories from religious texts and normalised through this \n7 \n \nframe, to the extent that medical authorities, in picking up on a (specifically Buddhist) language, have \nrisked alienating those from other faiths (Simpson 2004b). Referring specifically to nanotechnology, \nSchummer (2006) argues that language, cultural heritage, economy, politics and ethics may all differ \nbetween (and within) nations, and that these will shape responses to nanotechnology. As an example he \nsuggests that the Christian notion of a Creator God has shaped western critiques of science as hubristic \nand \u2018meddling\u2019 (cf Grove-White et al. 1997). \nSuch analyses point us to an understanding of religious activity as forming part of a cultural repertoire \nwhich can be used to make sense of new technologies. Culture, Ann Swidler writes, can be understood \nas \u201ca \u2018tool kit\u2019 of symbols, stories, rituals, and world-views, which people may use in varying \nconfigurations to solve different kinds of problems\u201d (1986: 273). The \u2018tool kits\u2019 of religious cultures thus \nprovide a range of resources with which the unfamiliar can be negotiated;v the notion might, perhaps, \nbe compared to that of habitus in the provision of largely unseen but powerful dispositions and skills.  \nWe should note, however, that at least one study suggests that there is little difference in surveyed \nviews on biotechnology between those who do and do not self-identify as being involved in religious \npractices (Levitt 2003); as we will argue later, our data also suggests common themes between those \nwith different levels of engagement with organised religion. A (US-based) survey of research scientists \nand Christian pastors on views on human cloning similarly revealed strong similarities in what forms of \ncloning were or were not seen as permissible (Weasel and Jensen 2005). Finally, Tamatea (2008) \nanalysed Christian websites in an attempt to understand lay Christian responses to \u2018GRIN\u2019 (genetics, \nrobotics, information and nano) technologies as they could apply to developments in artificial \nintelligence (AI). He suggests that the discourse of the sites made use of substantive and functionalist \nviews of what it means to be human \u2018in the image of God\u2019, noting that this stands in contrast to the \nthinking of many Biblical scholars. As Deane-Drummond et al. (2003) also suggest, then, there seems to \nbe a gap between lay religious responses and those from professionalised \u2018expert\u2019 or \u2018official\u2019 religious \ngroups, which is perhaps more significant than that between those with and without religious faith. \nThus such literature suggests that differences between active participants in religions and the non-\nreligious may be less important in defining how new technologies are negotiated than differences \nbetween national cultures. Such an analysis would be supported by Szerszynski\u2019s (2003; 2005) \narguments: the changes he writes about are at the level of whole cultures and can be understood in \ntheological terms, rather than necessarily being about individuals\u2019 overt identification with particular \nfaiths. Indeed, part of his thesis is that these categories may no longer be valid in western cultures \n(2005; see also Heelas et al. 2004). Instead, spiritualities of various forms are used to resource and \nnurture the \u201cunique, individual, lived life\u201d (2005, 819). \nGiven this, we turn now to examine our participants\u2019 experience of modern technological life and in \nparticular their concerns and hopes about nanotechnologies. While the focus of our analysis will be the \ntalk of the group of churchgoers, and its similarities and differences with that of other groups, we first \ndescribe key themes that arose in all the groups. We do this by briefly discussing some of the \noverlapping stories group talk constructed. \n8 \n \n \n3. Negotiating nanotechnology: key themes in lay talk \nAlthough the six groups were drawn from the same region (the North East of England), they \nencompassed a range of backgrounds and perspectives. One group was from an environmental and \nsocial activism student society, for example, while another was made up of older men who defined \nthemselves as \u2018interested in technology\u2019 in some way. Despite this diversity, as with similar studies (for \nexample Davies 2006; Kearnes et al. 2006; Macnaghten 2004; 2009), there were striking commonalities \nin the ways discussions crystallised and the concerns expressed about nanotechnology. Here we \ndescribe some of this key content and how it is constructed in talk; we should note, however, that in \ndoing this we do not understand these themes as static \u2018attitudes\u2019 or fixed positions (see Billig 1987). \nRather, they are stories that emerged at particular moments in the context of these group discussions, \ncreated through the use of sets of social, moral and theological resources (Swidler 1986). As such they \nwere used flexibly within the groups, being modified and adapted to meet immediate argumentative \npurposes.  \n1. Threats to the human and to natural orders \nWithin the context of the groups nanotechnology was frequently constructed as threatening, in multiple \nways, shared moral boundaries that constitute the nature and meaning of \u2018being human\u2019. Such \nboundaries were an implicit part of an apparently given \u2018natural\u2019 order. Within the groups, and in the \ncontext of the drivers and purposes of nanotechnology (see below), being human was thus constructed \nas operating within fixed limits. Key concerns included the loss of individuality, disruption of a natural \nlife course (birth and death), and the dangerous intersection of human life with machines.  \nIn fact, there was a wide range of ways that nanotechnological applications were seen as impinging on \nour humanity \u2013 sometimes involving novel and surprising equivalences. For example, in the quote below \none participant is talking about nanotechnologies that might in the future enable the \u2018downloading\u2019 and \nsharing of our memories: \nI wouldn't have a problem with it if you like- as an individual that would be fantastic thing, but I would be \nvery uncomfortable with the- losing personal choice and losing basically my identity, and independence. \nTo me that's just becoming a homogenous mass, and you aren't a person anymore. That to me would be \nan invasion of privacy I think. (Female, managers group) \nThe speaker is concerned that, whatever the benefits, such developments may lead to her \u2018not being a \nperson anymore\u2019. What is involved in this is multiple and overlapping: loss of personal choice, identity \nand independence, \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d. Here \u2018being a person\u2019 is not dependent on one or two key \nattributes, but is rather a complex intersection of multiple properties. Similar concerns were expressed \naround the breaching of other orders, such as \u2018Nature\u2019 itself. \n2. Control, drivers and power \n9 \n \nImportantly, these stories of threatened orders emerged within, and should be understood as framed \nby, a web of inter-related stories about how nanotechnology is situated in and dependent on the \nperceived immobility of existing power structures. Discussion on the levels of funding being allocated for \nnanotechnology research and development led to detailed considerations of the role of finance \u2013 \nnotably from big business and government \u2013 as a key force in shaping the technology and in pushing it in \nparticular and questionable directions. The motives of government and industry tended to be \ncharacterised as driven by self-interest and short-term considerations and thus likely to steer the \ntechnology towards military, consumer or other applications that participants thought of as lacking \ngenuine public value. Indeed, matters of finance were assumed, almost without question, to drive, \nmotivate and underpin the shape and form of nanotechnology\u2019s development.  \nThese stories of extended business and government control of and through nanotechnology were \nassociated with a corresponding sense of public powerlessness. Participants often spoke of a threatened \nautonomy, a heightened lack of control and a sense of being \u2018kept in the dark\u2019. For some these threats \nappeared overwhelming and to represent the single most pressing issue that nanotechnology \npresented: \nI think, for me, it\u2019s that powerlessness really. People, me, we, probably feel quite powerless to actually \nmake any difference to what\u2019s going to happen. Because a lot of it has already been happening - as we see \nfrom the charts and things - whether we will have, be able to actually have any impact at all. But also \ntransparency as well. Very few of us have been aware of what has been happening... (Female, \nchurchgoers group) \nHere one woman is summing up what has struck her most through the discussion: personal \npowerlessness and a lack of awareness as to \u201cwhat has been happening\u201d. She expresses this in terms \nthat are almost hopeless, reflecting that the group had no knowledge of developments in \nnanotechnology \u2013 implying secrecy on the part of the developers \u2013 and that, even though they know \nnow, they have very little chance of having any impact on \"what\u2019s going to happen\u201d.  \n3. The importance of individual autonomy \nThis point is especially striking given that a further key theme within the discussions centred on the \nimportance of individual choice and self-determination as a key ethical principle. Sometimes this was \nframed as being about consumer choice; most often, however, it was expressed as an awareness of a \nmultiplicity of perspectives and the sense that it would be wrong for any one individual to dictate \nparticular ways of behaving to others. In the quote below, for example, a participant reflects that \ndifferent people will hold different opinions on the issues that nanotechnology presents, concluding that \n\u201ceveryone will draw their own lines\u201d: \nBecause some people would say if you\u2019re going to have a child that is perhaps slightly deformed or slightly \ndisabled, some women would jump at the chance to have an injection and their baby to be born normal. \nSome would say well no, this is my baby, this is fate, this is what I, you know, I will bring that child up and \nraise it to be a normal child. Everyone joins a line, everyone will draw their own lines, I think. (Female, \nnatural health group) \n10 \n \n4. Consumption and seduction \nWe have noted that money and commerce were seen as key drivers of nanotechnology; as a corollary to \nthis, consumption practices and desires were seen also as important in driving and shaping the \ntechnology\u2019s future development. Consumption practices, especially those focusing on what were seen \nas superficial and unnecessary consumer products for the west, were often contrasted with \u2018good\u2019 or \n\u2018ethical\u2019 ways of using nanotechnology. These narratives were also related to perceptions of \npowerlessness, with groups talking of an economy of needless consumption being foisted upon them by \npowerful economic interests and dominant social norms. While groups were critical of such norms, at \nthe same time they acknowledged their power and seductive appeal:  \nWhatever they throw at us we\u2019ll all have it. So it\u2019s just finding more new things to sell. It\u2019s quite divisive. \nIt\u2019s just more and more that we want- different things that we want and the people who have it are those \nwho can afford it. It\u2019s divisive in terms of individuals, communities within a country and internationally. \n(Female, churchgoers group) \nThe speaker here seems torn between two perspectives. She is critical of the division arising from a \nconsumer culture in the creation of social rifts between those who can and cannot afford products, but \nat the same time she identifies the publics involved (herself included) as complicit, in tending to accept \nwhat is \u2018thrown\u2019. These are things that are, ultimately, \u2018wanted\u2019 \u2013 even if, as another participant went \non to point out, they are not actually \u2018needed\u2019. \nWe noted earlier that the narratives we have described \u2013 whether those of natural orders or of \nindividual consumption \u2013 should not be understood as fixed or stable. Inevitably our description of key \nthemes has simplified the complexity of real-life talk, ignoring the fact that positions shift and change, \nstories are modified, and narratives combine and overlap. In particular we should note that, in \ndescribing coherent, if inter-related, stories, we smooth over the considerable difficulties that occurred \nat times within groups in articulating and expressing reactions to nanotechnology, as well as the varying \nresources brought to bear in constructing these explanatory narratives. It is this notion \u2013 of resourcing \nthe expression of shared values \u2013 that we develop in section 4.  \nBefore moving on, however, we wish to make three points with regard to the lay negotiations of \nnanotechnology we have described. \nFirstly, we might suggest that there is a cross-cutting theme, within the stories characterised above, of \nlay ambivalence to nanotechnology. There is no straightforward weighing up of \u2018risks\u2019 and \u2018benefits\u2019 and \ncoming down \u2018for\u2019 or \u2018against\u2019; instead, our participants show enthusiasm mingled with concern and \ntempered by a detailed awareness of the real-life situations in which nanotechnologies will be enacted.  \nSecond, we might also helpfully compare our findings with those described by Deane-Drummond et al. \n(2003, drawing on Grove-White et al. 1997) on lay discussion of GM. There are striking similarities. They \nsum up by arguing: \n11 \n \nFirst, people appeared to be responding from within a sense of a given order \u2013 a natural order, the \nboundaries of which were felt to be challenged radically [by GM+\u2026 \nYet secondly, there was tacit acknowledgement that human beings might be justified in certain \ncircumstances in creative interactions (interference) in such order. But this should only occur if the \npurposes were somehow the right ones \u2013 which appeared to mean, governed by genuine compassion and \ncharity to other beings\u2026 \nHowever, thirdly, such a condition was felt unlikely to be met. There was a recurrent fatalism and \ncynicism about the prospect of modifying the momentum of GM developments\u2026 (Deane-Drummond et \nal. 2003, 26, emphases in original) \nIn both sets of data \u2013 on GM and nanotechnology, collected over ten years apart \u2013 we find similar \nconcerns: the challenging of natural orders, the necessity of right purposes, cynicism and distrust of \nthose driving developments, a sense of personal powerlessness. We will return to these similarities (and \nperhaps intensifications) as we conclude, in section 5. \nFinally, we might note that the narratives we have identified all have strong moral and ethical \ndimensions and can \u2013 as Deane-Drummond et al (2003) and Szerszynski (2005) suggest \u2013 be understood \nas pertaining to the theological. Talk about a sense of threatened humanity, for example, points to \nnotions of right and wrong forms of intervention in the limits of humanity and the sacrality of particular \nways of being human. Discourses of the ethically dubious drivers of nanotechnology suggest other \nprinciples that should be applied to technological development. Given this seems to be true of public \naccounts of nanotechnology as a whole (and, given Deane-Drummond et al\u2019s analysis, of technology \nmore broadly), what might this mean for analysis of the talk of the explicitly religious? In the next \nsection we explore this question, focusing our analysis on one focus group \u2013 composed of attenders of a \nsingle church \u2013 in particular.vi We argue that this group, because of their religious affiliations, had access \nto a particular set of linguistic resources which helped them to articulate responses to nanotechnology \nwhich were themselves, however, not unique to this group but based on values and concerns more \nwidely shared across other group discussions. In Swidler\u2019s (1986) terms, their cultural \u2018tool kit\u2019 contains \nspecific elements which could be readily accessed and used in discussions of nanotechnology. Using a \nlanguage of spirituality and relationality they were able to express shared notions of what \nnanotechnology threatens (and promises); notions which, as this section has indicated, were common to \nall groups, but which were in practice frequently hesitant, implicit, and incompletely articulated. This \ngroup, we suggest, can therefore be seen as exemplary of lay negotiations of these issues: using \nlanguage drawn from Christian belief, they were able to express what at times other groups found \ndifficult to articulate. \n \n4. Religious affiliation and linguistic resources \nWe start by giving short overviews of the participants, the progress of this focus group, and the group\u2019s \ndiscussions during the one-day workshop. Before we do this it is important to note that while we are \nfocussing on the linguistic resources participants\u2019 religious affiliations provided them with, this was not \n12 \n \nthe only identity taken up during discussions. As with all of the groups, participants made use of \ndifferent roles and identities at different points of the conversation, as well as particular group identities \nbeing created during the course of the discussion. In this group, individuals made use of professional, \ngenerational and geographical identities as well as that of \u2018Christian\u2019. \nThe group was made up of eight participants (numbers fell to seven for the workshop), with an age \nrange of 30 to 80, recruited from a single Anglican church which described itself as \u2018open evangelical\u2019. \nWithin an initial evening focus group, discussion focussed around a number of topics: consumption and \nmarketing, de-humanising tendencies of nanotechnologies, lay lack of control and the importance of \nchoice, and uncertainties and dangers. As section 3 has described, none of these were unique to this \ngroup. After this session, participants were encouraged to do their own research on nanotechnology \nbefore the workshop, four days later, at which discussion continued and the group developed a short \npresentation based on what they saw as the most pressing ethical issues raised by the technology. In the \nworkshop the group continued to focus on issues of de-humanisation (though also touching on others, \nsuch as military applications and uncertain side effects and dangers). Though their presentation \nshowcased a range of perspectives, the final vision was pessimistic, an effect which was heightened by \nthe final part of the performance: a song sung to the tune of All things bright and beautiful but entitled \nAll things weird and scary. It described various outcomes of nanotechnology and framed them as \nunwanted and ineffective, making people \u201cless than human\u201d and granting immortality rather than \nwisdom.  \nThis description of the group\u2019s discussions shows no striking distinguishing features; rather, there is a \nlarge degree of continuity with the other groups in the kinds of narratives created around \nnanotechnology. We turn to examine instead the ways in which these stories were created, resourced \nand reflected upon, arguing three key points about the specific language the group had access to. \nOur first point is straightforward. It is simply that, as churchgoers, the group could readily access specific \nvocabularies in order to construct their responses to nanotechnologies. As an example we take a short \nstretch of collaborative talk in which the group are attempting to express their response to pervasive \ncomputing applications of nanotechnology (such as in surveillance or \u2018smart\u2019 environments; see Royal \nSociety and Royal Academy of Engineering 2004): \nEd: I dunno, it\u2019s coralling people. I think it\u2019s just really controls you.  \nMary: It\u2019s like removing the human soul, isn\u2019t it? \nCath: It is. \nMary: It\u2019s removing what it is that makes us individual and replacing it with-  \nEd:  Convenience. \nMary:  -a technology that says \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I know what you want, I know what you need, I know what \nyou fancy.\u201d\nvii \nThe story being created here is not unique to this group. It tells of nanotechnology\u2019s dehumanising \neffects as it strips away autonomy and individuality (see section 3.1): thus the technology comes to \ncontrol, to remove choice and to \u2018nanny\u2019 (the implication of Mary\u2019s last turn). However, in line two Mary \n13 \n \nuses a specifically religious shorthand to express this when she suggests that the technology\u2019s effects \nare \u201clike removing the human soul\u201d \u2013 a point which Cath affirms in line three. Mary goes on to expand \non exactly what this means; Cath\u2019s affirmation indicates, however, that Mary\u2019s meaning is already clear \nto her. \nThroughout the group\u2019s discussion similar language drawn from religious activity is used and concepts \nsuch as God, the soul, spirit, and eternal life brought in to construct arguments. There are, of course, \nsome commonalities with the discourse of other groups in this. Phrases such as \u2018playing God\u2019 are used in \nreligious and non-religious groups alike (though the churchgoers group were more likely to use this kind \nof language). This leads on to our second point: that when these references to religious or spiritual \nconcepts occur, the churchgoers group were much more able to \u2018fill them in\u2019 or expand on them. Thus, \nfor most of our groups, talking of \u2018playing God\u2019 or \u2018messing with nature\u2019 seem to act as symbolic \nexpressions of the inexpressible. They truncate or end conversation: they have meaning, but that \nmeaning cannot be further articulated. Take, for example, this exchange from the technology \nenthusiasts group: \nJon: Isn't it weird how in the space of two hours we've gone from mobile phones to creating life with \nviruses? \nMod: Yes- but it's still technology \nJon: Well it is, but we're getting to a very dangerous stage now, where you're talking about being God \nreally, aren't you? (laughter) \nAfter the exchange ends in laughter \u2013 presumably triggered by the (perhaps rather clich\u00e9d) reference to \n\u2018being God\u2019 \u2013 conversation moves to a slightly different topic. Here the talk links to narratives of limits \nbeing transcended (section 3.1) and the sense of the hubris of science (section 3.2); these are, however, \ntouched on rather than explored in detail. We have learned from Jon that there is an equivalence \nbetween \u2018being God\u2019 and danger, but nothing more; his presumed fears and concerns about this danger, \nand how it might be characterised, are not expanded on. There is a similar loss for words in the \nfollowing extract, where talk is focussed around worrying threats to life\/non-life boundaries: \nKate: It\u2019s like they are trying to turn you into a computer. \nMod: That\u2019s interesting. Is all this about trying to turn you into a computer? \nLou: So you're more efficient. \nMod: In what way do you think? They were thinking of you as if you were a computer? Say a little bit \nmore about that. \nKate: Um\u2026I don\u2019t know, just to create an ideal world. (Natural health group) \nKate has brought up the notion that \u2018they\u2019 are using nanotechnology to erode human nature and \u201cturn \nyou into a computer\u201d. Again, this is a familiar story of threatened humanity. The moderator tries to \nprobe this image further: is this process of dehumanisation what nanotechnology is about? And what \ndoes that involve? While Lou suggests this change is about efficiency, Kate\u2019s answer tails out with \u201cI \ndon\u2019t know\u201d and a vague suggestion of the creation of an \u201cideal world\u201d. Her use of the computer image \nhas pointed to something which she is unable to fully articulate: it is deeply symbolic, but its full \nmeaning is difficult to express. \n14 \n \nWe might compare the failures of language these groups are struggling with \u2013 around key, but largely \nunexpressed, notions of what should be \u2018sacred\u2019 (cf Davies 2006) \u2013 with talk on a similar topic in the \nchurchgoers group. The group are discussing nanotechnology\u2019s potential for human enhancement \u2013 \nagain, something that was frequently understood as threatening what it is to be human: \nEd: If it gets to the stage where it\u2019s- it\u2019s the human enhancement. Are we playing God to a certain \nextent? \nMod: Yeah. \nCath: It\u2019s almost like replace- \nEd: Because if we can do everything ourselves why do we need [the] Almighty? \nCath: The science becomes God in a way. \nHere we see the familiar trope of \u2018playing God\u2019 used by Ed to convey his concern about human \nenhancement. Immediately, however, and in contrast with Jon\u2019s use of the term above, what this means \nis \u2018filled in\u2019 and expanded by Ed and Cath: Ed explains that \u201cif we can do everything ourselves why do we \nneed the Almighty?\u201d, while Cath says that the science is acting to replace \u2013 or become \u2013 God. In both \nexplanations the notion of human interference in sacred territory is further developed. \u2018Playing God\u2019 will \nlead to human self-sufficiency, pushing the \u2018Almighty\u2019 from spaces that are rightfully his (Ed), and in fact \ninvolving the replacement of God with science (Cath). Rather than working to end conversation, the use \nof the \u2018playing God\u2019 phrase has stimulated it. \nIt seems, then, that this group\u2019s religious affiliations provide them with a language that can help express \nthe concerns that all our groups raise about nanotechnology\u2019s potential to impinge on sacred spaces. \nWhile other groups point to these concerns, but often struggle to characterise them, the churchgoers \ngroup have access to language that can equip them to articulate these notions of threatened humanity \nand scientific hubris. The content, themes and concerns are the same, but the explicit calls to the \ntheological seem to enable fuller accounts, filling in the details of what is threatened, and how. Our final \npoint is that the use of these specific linguistic resources can actually open up spaces for reflection on \nand around these notions; that the churchgoers group, because of their use of languages of spirituality \nand relationality, could deliberate particularly thoroughly on all that nanotechnology might mean for \nlived human lives.  \nAs an example of this we take a stretch of discussion from the start of the workshop where the group \nare summing up their views and the concerns they have raised. The moderator is writing notes on a flip \nchart; as the extract starts, he asks for some of the preceding discussion to be repeated: \nMod: Can I capture a bit more about what makes us human, which you mention is the capacity to\u2026 \nDelia: Capacity for relationships, you know the whole relational idea, how we relate to each other, \nwhat is valuable, how value is placed on human beings I suppose. \nCath: I would say interaction with the world around you as well, as people. \nMod: I just want to see what the threat- and the Christian sense then that we are all of equal value. \nYeah? And in what way does nano threaten that, specifically? \nMary: Well, there will be kind of potential for selecting people to enhance them. The very term \nenhancement means- \n15 \n \nDelia: The very meaning of enhancement, what is that value judgement? \nMary: -better than. You\u2019re enhanced, you are not enhanced. \nCath: Stronger and happier and whatever, is better than-  \nDelia: It\u2019s divisive. \nMary:  Different kinds of discrimination will occur. \nTessa: Like an apartheid. \nThe section of talk starts with a statement \u2013 or rather, a repetition of a statement \u2013 of what it is to be \nhuman (in the context of what is being threatened by nanotechnology). Delia emphasises the notions of \nrelationality and value, filling this out with a string of explanatory clauses (\u201chow we relate to each other\u201d \nand following). From this description of being human, which draws on a particular kind of language \n(\u201crelationships\u201d, \u201crelate\u201d, \u201cvalue\u201d) and which Delia has earlier described as being specifically Christian \n(the moderator picks up on this in his second turn), the group create a collaborative and free-form \ndiscussion, riffing on the linguistic building blocks Delia has provided to develop new positions. Cath, for \nexample, picks up on the idea of relationality to emphasise that this must include \u201cthe world around \nyou\u201d as well as human actors. After the moderator\u2019s second turn, Mary, Delia and Cath create together \nan argument about the very notion of \u201cenhancement\u201d\u2019s threat to equal valuing of diversity. Tessa\u2019s \nstatement, that this will lead to an \u201capartheid\u201d, builds on their argument and completes it.  \nLanguage around \u2018being human\u2019 is thus used to improvise further discussion and to develop further \npositions. Here the use of specific linguistic resources opens up conversation and allows reflection as to \nwhat nanotechnology\u2019s implications will be: the group move, as this reflection occurs, from notions of \nrelationality and value to the \u2018apartheid\u2019-like consequences of the disruption of these notions. Such \ndiscussions are not limited to arguments about threatened humanity or the traditionally \u2018spiritual\u2019. \nRather, it seems that the resources this group have are flexible enough to create a range of stories, \nincluding ones about governance, power, ethical and fair use of new technologies, and the pitfalls of a \nconsumer society. Strikingly, then, whereas in the extracts above talk about \u2018playing God\u2019 or threatened \nhumanity closes down discussion, in this case such terms are used as the basis for further conversation \nand creative and collaborative elaborations of them. Space for deliberation is thus opened up as, in this \nprocess, multiple perspectives are created and tested.  \n \n5. Conclusions \nIn the last two sections we have described key themes which emerged from focus group discussions on \nnanotechnology and argued that one group in particular, composed of churchgoers, had particularly \ndeveloped linguistic resources with which to construct and negotiate these. As we have noted already, \nthe stories created by this group have much in common with those from other groups. The difference \nlies in the resources brought to bear in constructing these and the traction they have for further \ndevelopment, deliberation, and discussion. In particular, we have suggested that the churchgoers make \nuse of specific vocabularies (using terms such as \u2018soul\u2019 and \u2018the Almighty\u2019 and drawing on specific \ndiscourses of relationality), that these terms function as a shorthand which can be expanded upon if \n16 \n \nnecessary, and, finally, that the process of this expansion is freeform and creative, acting to open up \ndiscursive space for further deliberation. Before reflecting more generally, there are several points to \nmake with regard to these arguments. \nFirstly, it is important to note that we are not suggesting that our data indicates a contrast between \nna\u00efve and inarticulate non-religious laypeople, on the one hand, and well-resourced and sophisticated \nchurchgoers, on the other. All of the groups created sophisticated arguments and narratives about \nnanotechnology\u2019s threats and promises, and all resourced these in multiple ways using a range of \nsources. The churchgoing group had a particular shared language with which they could do this, which \nmade it easier for them to articulate values shared throughout all of the groups: their cultural tool kit \ncontained linguistic resources helpful for talking about nanotechnology. In this way they can be seen as \na \u2018voice\u2019 for these shared values, articulating notions which others at times found it difficult to express. \nSecond, we are also not suggesting that this group were unique as Christian churchgoers. It seems likely \nthat religious affiliations of any kind would provide similar resources with which to make sense of new \ntechnologies. (Simpson\u2019s work on new reproductive technologies in Sri Lanka (2004a; 2004b), for \nexample, has shown how Buddhist folk literature was used to provide a language for the negotiation of \nthese techniques.) This claim, however, has not been \u2013 and cannot be \u2013 tested within our data, focused \nas it is within a particular context. Further research must address the question of how more religiously \nplural contexts affect this process of resourcing the negotiation of emerging technologies. \nWe also do not want to create a distinction between the \u2018theology\u2019 of our churchgoers group and the \nresponses or \u2018concerns\u2019 of other participants. As Deane-Drummond et al. (2003) argue, and as we \nsuggested at the end of section 3, all responses to developments such as nanotechnology \u2013 from \nreligious and non-religious voices alike \u2013 can be understood in theological terms. The narratives created \nin our groups depict nanotechnology as raising questions around what it means to be human, what a \nright relationship with our surrounding environment is, how society should be ordered, and what it \nmeans to live \u2018ethically\u2019 and well (to name a few). In this sense, all of our participants have been \u2018doing\u2019 \ntheology. This also aligns with Szersynski\u2019s analysis of science and society (2005). All negotiations of \nscience, he suggests, and indeed all of science itself, are intrinsically and inevitably theological \u2013 \nwhether this is acknowledged or not. \nAs we conclude we want to reflect on two further points that arise from our discussion; firstly by \nreturning to the analogy with GM. As we noted earlier, there are striking similarities between our \nfindings, derived from lay discussions of nanotechnology, and those from a study conducted ten years \nearlier on lay talk about GM (Deane-Drummond et al. 2003; Grove-White et al. 1997). In fact, we might \nargue that nanotechnology \u2013 which encompasses GM in its promises of the \u2018next industrial revolution\u2019 \n(Roco 2001)  \u2013 has acted to intensify these concerns (cf Macnaghten 2009). Our groups appear to bring \nforth stronger statements of the inviability of orders, the inevitability of their bulldozing, and the \npowerlessness of laypeople. Despite these intensifications \u2013 or perhaps as part of their cause \u2013 the \nnature and motivations of the institutions involved are understood as having remained more or less the \nsame. The latent anxieties around contemporary science and technology\u2019s purposes, drivers and control \n17 \n \nbrought to the surface a decade ago by GM \u2013 and representing, as Brian Wynne has argued (1996), \nunease at the \u2018institutional body language\u2019 of those controlling new technologies \u2013 thus seem to remain \npresent within lay cultures.  \nThe way in which such anxieties were expressed was exacerbated, it has been suggested, by the ways in \nwhich scientific developments were framed and represented by the elites driving them (Deane-\nDrummond et al 2003; Wynne 2003). Such accounts not only hide the value commitments contained \nwithin science within a bracket of \u2018rationality\u2019, but typically present faith-based concerns as minority and \nna\u00efve partisanship. That religious perspectives are not representative of wider public concerns is, in \nmany cases, taken as read. Our argument has been rather different. In fact, we have suggested that our \ndata implies the exact opposite of such assumptions: the concerns and talk of those with religious \naffiliations may actually be seen as exemplary of laypeople\u2019s negotiations of new technologies. Not only \nis there little difference in the character of the concerns and anxieties expressed, but religious affiliation \nappears to provide a language with which shared values can be articulated. If this is the case, it calls for \na radically different way of framing contributions to debates around new technologies. Currently both \nexpert and lay talk marginalises and positions as embarrassingly \u201cwishy-washy\u201d \u2013 a quote from our data \n\u2013 faith-based perspectives. At the very least, our data has suggested that those from lay religious groups \nshould be considered as having valuable contributions to make. We might suggest that such arguments \ncan be pushed further to highlight a fundamental disconnect between the implicit theologies of policy \nand scientific discourses and those of lay publics, whether secular or religious. Within the arena of \nnanotechnology policy, for example, discussions of \u2018social and ethical issues\u2019 frequently remain fixated \nupon questions of risk and safety (for example, Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution 2008). \nSuch questions are, of course, important. But the discourses which bound them \u2013 of science, rationality, \nand control \u2013 contain no space for the deeply theological questions which have emerged from our focus \ngroups and which are expressed in a particular form within the talk of the churchgoers group. One way \nforward, we might suggest, is in a willingness to open up debate to such questions and to let the \ntheological into science policy. Such an approach could, through making use of the resources held within \nthe religious and the theological, present an opportunity to move beyond sterile risk debates and to \ngenuinely deepen policy discourse, enabling it to better keep step with the tenor of public concern. \n \nReferences \nBeck U. 1992.

While we did not seek representativeness \n(being interested more in the range and variability of meanings in the population at large) we nevertheless aimed to tap into \nsignificant fractions of society. We thus selected groups around commonalities likely to be of relevance to the discussion of \nnanotechnology. Based on previous research, relations to the body, environmental issues, technology, governance, notions of \nlimits and moral boundaries, and a sense of personal agency were all seen as likely to be key in structuring responses to \nnanotechnology (Kearnes et al 2006b), and groups were selected around relationships to these factors. The final groups were as \nfollows: \n1. Church attenders group, recruited from a single church. \n2. Student environmental group, recruited from the organisation People and Planet. \n3. Natural health group (users of organic produce and natural health techniques). \n4. Confident believers group (positive towards technology and its governance). \n5. Local involvers group (active or potentially active within local community). \n6. Authority figures group (sense of personal agency and control). \niv\n Kearnes et al. (2006b) review this early public attitude research and the predictable pattern of results.  \nv\n Similarly, previous work has examined the repertoires of resources present within expert cultures (Rip 2006) or those \npresented by media sources (te Kulve 2006). \nvi\n While the church attenders group was selected specifically for their religious affiliation, the groups were not selected in ways \nthat were mutually exclusive and therefore other groups may have contained participants with religious belief. However, no \nother groups were brought together around a commonality of expressed faith, and identities in these groups tended to be \nconstructed around secular features (such as a love of technology or activity within the local community).  \nvii\n Where we show extracts of conversations (rather than quotes from individuals) we provide anonymised names to indicate \nspeakers. \u2018Mod\u2019 indicates the focus group moderator. \n"}
