A number of evaluative frameworks stress governance, structure and \nmanagement as the fundamental factors contributing to partnership success.  However, \nethnographic research into the multi-agency partnership that sets the strategic direction for \ntobacco control in the North East of England revealed emotional engagement and positive \npersonal relationships, factors that have largely been overlooked in the relevant literature, to \nbe more important. The partnership coordinators have successfully used a model developed \nby grassroots organizers in the international tobacco control movement to create an \nenvironment where positive affect and mutual liking develop and underpin a dynamic and \nproductive partnership. In some cases, this grassroots model directly contradicts the advice of \npartnership tools and analyses, but has proved highly effective in engaging with professionals. \n \nIntroduction \n \nPartnership or collaborative working is seen as an appropriate means of widening the \nresponsibility for and lessening the burden of the major public health issues worldwide, and is \na particular concern of contemporary health policy makers in the UK (Snape and Taylor, \n2003:1; Wanless, 2004:183-184; Glasby et al, 2006). Collaborative partnerships have been \none of the key components of the current Labour government\u201fs \u201eThird Way\u201f governance \napproach (Snape and Taylor, 2003: 7; Dowling et al, 2004: 309; ODPM, 2005; Dickinson, \n 3 \n2006: 375). Nevertheless, many of the resulting partnerships have not been as productive as \nwas originally hoped (Huxham, 1996: 239; Newman, 2002; Huxham and Vangen 2005).  \nAs a result, a range of evaluative frameworks have been developed in the UK in recent \nyears (Hudson et al, 1999; Asthana et al, 2002; Audit Commission, 2005; Hardy et al, 2003; \nODPM, 2005; ODPM, 2006; Dickinson, 2006).  These evaluative frameworks tend to focus \non tangible issues, such as structure, governance, accountability, outcome measures and \nprocess (Dowling et al, 2004: 311).  Some contradict each other, for instance calling for clear \nstructures, while others call for greater flexibility. Some call for clear aims and objectives, \nwhile others suggest that too much clarity may inhibit partner engagement by excluding those \nwho might bring a slightly different motivation to the table.  Inherent in many of these \ncontradictions is an uncertainty about the importance of the emotional engagement of the \nindividuals involved. Complex personal relationships are often simplified to one characteristic \nsuch as \u201etrust\u201f (McAllister 1995; Hudson et al, 1999; Huxham and Vangen, 2005), \u201eopenness\u201f \nor \u201einclusiveness\u201f (ODPM, 2005: Appendix 2).  They are frequently included as one factor \nalongside many others and are embedded within other principles, such as \u201eownership\u201f, \u201egood \ngovernance\u201f or \u201eclarity of structures\u201f (e.g. Hardy et al, 2003), or on an economic model that \nreduces participation to a matter of \u201ecosts\u201f and benefits\u201f, mediated by factors such as \nleadership, decision-making and accountability (Metzger et al, 2005). Such tendencies may \npartly be related to the difficulty of pinning down the emotional dynamics which lead to \nfunctioning partnerships, but they can also be related to a general assumption that work \nrelationships are instrumental (Gersick et al, 2000: 1027) and a concern to avoid the overt \nattempts to control emotion that have become all too common in popular management \n(Fineman 2000b; Bolton, 2005). \nOur concern here is to highlight the factors that have contributed to the dynamism and \nenergy of the Smoke Free North East (SFNE) Advisory Panel, a high-level strategic \n 4 \npartnership that has been described by one of its members as having \u201ea sort of fizz and \nan...excitement to the atmosphere which is enormously positive and (off which) people feed\u201f \n(AP13).  It was clear from the outset that the important emotional dynamics were more \nsimilar to those described for citizen coalitions, such as hope, the influence of a charismatic \nleader (who nevertheless was not more powerful than the other members), the sense that \nmembers\u201f input was valuable and the hope that the partnership would significantly improve \npublic health.  Participants in the advisory panel put this down to \u201eluck\u201f, \u201ea good mix\u201f or even \n\u201emagic\u201f and most were unable to explain how the positive emotional charge of the partnership \nwas created.  However, the ethnographic methods used in this study have shed new light on \nthis element and reveal something about how it came about and how its presence relates to the \nstructures, governance and management that are the central focus of many of the partnership \nevaluation tools in existence. \n \nEmotional Dynamism in Partnerships \n \nIn the last decade or two, a neglect of emotion in the workplace by researchers has, to a \ncertain extent, been redressed (Fineman, 2000a; Bolton, 2005; Coupland et al, 2008). \nHowever the importance of emotional dynamics in the health and long-term success of \ncoalitions and partnerships are less well documented. One major arena of collaborative work, \ngrassroots movement building, has been highly successful at intentionally motivating, \nintegrating, and engaging individuals since at least the 1960s (see for example Staples, 2004). \nGrassroots movements work hard to create emotional dynamics that make people want to \nbecome involved and committed to their coalition. A few studies of citizen coalitions show \nthat members of the public are more likely to participate in coalitions, grassroots campaigns \nor public health initiatives if they feel useful, valued, hopeful, and involved on equal terms \n 5 \nwith professionals and managers (van Stokkom, 2005; Peterson et al, 2006; ). However, \nstudies of partnerships involving professionals and experts do not consider these emotions, \ninstead focusing on control dynamics, trust and conflict resolution (Mohr and Spekman, 1994; \nHuxham and Vangen, 2005; Hudson, 2004; Duffy, 2008). This is to some extent \nunderstandable since we know that managers and administrators downgrade emotional \nexperiences in order to conform to generally accepted ideas of professional behaviour \n(Coupland et al, 2008), a factor which helps to explain why coalitions designed to increase \nengagement with lay members of the public have different emotional dynamics than groups \ninvolving high level professionals or experts (van Stokkom, 2005). We argue, however, that \nthe adoption of grassroots methods by the managers of this high-level strategic partnership \nhas been key in developing the successful dynamic. \n \nPartnerships in Tobacco Control \n \nBased on successful tobacco control (TC) initiatives in California (Bal et al, 2001), \nMassachusetts (Robbins and Krakow, 2000), Canada (Cunningham, 1996), and elsewhere, the \nWHO has developed what can be considered best practice guidelines for TC. Its Framework \nConvention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) (WHO, 2003) has been made legally binding in at \nleast 142 countries (WHO, n.d.). The FCTC goal is to \u201ecreate a social milieu and legal climate \nin which tobacco becomes less desirable, less acceptable and less available\u201f (CDHS, 1998: 3). \nThis guiding principle entails a series of \u201ecomprehensive multisectoral measures and \ncoordinated responses\u201f (WHO, 2003: 6), requiring a broad array of expertise and legitimacy.  \nOne of the central challenges of TC, then, is to develop partnerships that can \neffectively plan and implement these measures. The formation and activities of partnerships in \nTC are ideally dictated by a series of evidence-based interventions that have been repeatedly \n 6 \ndemonstrated to be effective (CDC, 1999; Mueller et al, 2006; Robbins and Krakow, 2000; \nAmerican Cancer Society, 2003a, 2003b; WHO, 2004: 217-26). Crucially, TC originated as a \ngrassroots movement and some of the key guidelines for strategy development include \ntechniques for grassroots coalition building (eg American Cancer Society, 2003b).   \nIn 2002, England\u201fs Department of Health developed a six-strand tobacco programme, \nwhich was largely based on the international evidence base (Department of Health, n.d.) and \non 16 December 2004, the UK ratified the FCTC (WHO, n.d.). The Department of Health\u201fs \nsix-strand programme and the California programme were the key influences on the formation \nof the SFNE model (Fresh-SFNE 2006: 10), thereby integrating international best practice \ninto its design.  \n \n 7 \nSmoke Free North East \n \nSmoke Free North East is the umbrella term for a broad network of TC alliances, working \ngroups and activities in the North East region of England.  It was formally launched 31 May \n2005. SFNE\u201fs activities are determined by the regional tobacco strategy, which prioritises \neight strands of activity: the six Department of Health strands; the development of regional \nTC infrastructure; and monitoring and evaluation (Table 1).  The operational level activities \nare coordinated through a series of regional and local alliances that consist of members from \nlocal government, NHS primary care organisations, acute, mental health and ambulance \ntrusts, prisons, voluntary organisations, local businesses, the fire service, etc. All these \nactivities are coordinated on a regional level by the Smoke Free North East Office, which has \na director, two regional coordinators and a number of commissioned and administrative staff.  \nThe structure and funding of SFNE is the first of its kind in the UK.   \nThe SFNE advisory panel sits over the operational alliances.  It is a multi-agency \npartnership whose aims are to guide the strategic direction of SFNE and ensure that the \nstrongest evidence base is followed. In 2006, when data were collected, it consisted of \nrepresentatives from a wide range of public and third sector organisations (Table 2).  The \nrepresentatives were mostly directors and upper level management, with an elected councillor \nand two representatives of voluntary organisations.  \nTable 1 illustrates how the activities of each of the members fit into the strategy. \nWithin each strand, the organisations that could play a role were identified and key regional \norganisations were invited to join the advisory panel. The individual advisory panel members \nhad a variety of roles and tasks, which fell into four categories: \n \n 8 \n1) Attendance of quarterly meetings to set policy, the budget and oversee the \noperation of the office and other alliances; \n2) Advising office staff as and when necessary; \n3) Disseminating information to and engaging their own organisations in TC \ncampaigns; \n4) Individual activities depending upon their position and skill. \n \nFor example, the representative of the voluntary organisations network was asked to mobilize \nhis members to write letters and sign petitions for passage of the 2006 Health Bill; the \nenvironmental health representative worked to ensure that information about the details of the \nupcoming legislation flowed as quickly as possible between government and the \nenvironmental health departments of the northeast region\u201fs 24 local councils, since these were \nto be responsible for enforcing the new regulations; the trading standards agency \nrepresentative was responsible for the flow of information about restricting underage sales \nand advertising, as well as commenting on the perceived desirability of stricter laws and \nenforcement. As shall be seen below the second and the fourth of these activities were crucial \nin encouraging advisory panelmembers to be more active in the first and third categories.  \n \n(Insert table 1 here) \n(Insert table 2 here) \n \nMethods \n \nFineman (2000a: 13) has identified a series of difficulties with studying emotions.  These \ninclude the fact that \u201eexpressed emotions and private feelings do not necessarily correlate, nor \n 9 \nare they always known to the individual\u201f and that \u201edifferent social\/organisational contexts \nencode different rules of feeling and emotion display\u201f.  For him, methods such as \nquestionnaires, experiments and interviews distort the subject matter and obscure the role of \nemotions in workplace settings.  Instead, he argues for methods that will capture \u201esituated \ndiscourses\u201f of emotion, in other words a \u201ecritical style of ethnographic organisational \nresearch\u201f (2000a:14). This study uses such methods, combined with elements of action \nresearch as described by Huxham (2003). Participant observation was used to identify \nsignificant issues and to develop semi-structured interviews (Dewalt and Dewalt, 2002). The \nresultant responses were then triangulated with further participant observation and documents \nused and written by participants to identify correlations and contradictions. As Huxham points \nout, in undertaking this kind of research, the researcher sacrifices some control over factors \nsuch as replicability and quantification in order to fully immerse in the research context, \nthereby becoming aware of issues that are unspoken, not well understood by participants or \nintentionally downplayed.   \nData on which this paper is based were collected in several contexts:  \n1) Participant observation in the SFNE office; observation of advisory panel \nmeetings (three meetings) and one-on-one meetings between the SFNEO director \nand members of the advisory panel between April and November 2006; other \nevents such as the visit of the Deputy Chief Medical Officer to the region in May \n2006, and annual planning days. \n2) One-on-one semi-structured interviews with 15 of the 20 advisory panel members \ncarried out by Heckler between June and October 2006;  \n3) Semi-structured telephone interviews with 14 of 21 members of the Department \nof Health\u201fs Tobacco Policy Team between August and October 2006; \n4) Iterative feedback of results to participants and incorporation of their comments; \n 10 \n5) Collation and analysis of grey literature, scientific literature and internal \ndocuments used by SFNE members and employees. \n \nDetailed notes of affective statements, attitudes, interactions and subsequent responses \nwere taken during participant observation. As participant observation largely occurred at \nmeetings, it was possible to write these extensively without causing undue influence on \nparticipants\u201f behaviour or utterances. Participant feedback was collected either during \nconversations, during which detailed notes were taken, in written form by e-mail or as \nthoughts marked on hard copies of preliminary analyses. Unstructured interviews occurred at \na time and place specified by the participant, often in their office during work hours, and \nlasted between 45 and 75 minutes (Box 1). They were audio-recorded and transcribed \nverbatim.  They were then subjected to thematic analysis by Heckler and coded in respect to \nthe themes raised by the participants (Box 2). The analysis was cross-checked by Russell. The \nidentified themes were then matched with similar themes in participant observation notes, \niterative feedback and documents using a method similar to that described by Huxham (2003). \nIn what follows, quotes have been drawn from recorded interviews or comments \nwritten by participants themselves.  Since the interviews sought to elucidate what respondents \nthemselves considered significant, in their own words, rather than measuring significance \nagainst a checklist of pre-assigned factors, not all respondents articulated the same factors or \nissues in their responses.  Failure to mention a topic cannot be taken as meaning it had no \nsignificance for the interviewee in question; however, where disagreement existed between \nrespondents we indicate this in our text.  In some cases, details have been generalised to avoid \nidentification of the participant.  For each instance where sufficient information is divulged \nthat participants may be identified, they have given written consent. The project was reviewed \nand approved by the following ethics committees: Sunderland TPCT\u201fs local research ethics \n 11 \ncommittee (06\/Q0904\/47); Durham University\u201fs School for Health (EC2\/06\/2); and Durham \nUniversity\u201fs Anthropology Department (ETH\/05\/05). Prior informed consent of all the \nsubjects was obtained before the research began.  \n \n(Insert Box 1 here) \n(Insert Box 2 here) \n \nResults and Discussion \n \nThe Campaign \nIt is difficult to teas out SFNE\u201fs contribution to successes in which many groups, including \nthe advisory panel, have played a part. The main priority for the first eighteen months of \nSFNE\u201fs existence was the passage and subsequent implementation of the Health Act 2006, \nwhich made smoking unlawful in virtually all enclosed workplaces.  The passage of this Bill \nwas a major success for England\u201fs TC community as a whole, especially since the \ngovernment had originally supported a watered down version of the bBill.  \nIt impossible to determine what proportion of this success was due to SFNE\u201fs \ncampaign as opposed to the work of the many other groups involved nationally. However, \nDepartment of Health Tobacco Policy Team members highlighted two SFNE activities that \nthey considered to have been of national influence.  The first of these was the distribution of \n145,000 Fresh-SFNE branded postcards calling for a total ban in enclosed workplaces, which \nled to the highest response of any region to the government consultation on the proposed \nlegislation (approximately 18% of the government\u201fs recorded 60,000 responses were from the \nNorth East [Fresh-SFNE, 2006: 27], which has only 5% of country\u201fs total population).  \nSecond was the production of a survey which showed that 81% of pubs in the District of \n 12 \nEasington, which contains some of the most deprived wards in England, would have been \nexempt from the legislation under the government\u201fs proposal (Fresh-SFNE, 2006: 24).  This \nsurvey was used nationally to argue that the government\u201fs proposal would widen, rather than \nnarrow, health inequalities, thereby running counter to one of the government\u201fs own public \nservice agreement targets.  \nAnother activity that was singled out as uniquely effective was a campaign to \nencourage supporters to write letters to their local paper, which may have been influential in \nthe unusual step of throwing the bill open to a free vote.  As one advisory panel member put \nit:  \n\u201eWhat I do know is that... (cabinet members, some of whom are in the region) read \ntheir local press cuttings...so it did seem that if we kept putting tobacco control in the \nlocal newspapers...that were going to be landing on Tony Blair\u201fs desk and (other \nsenior government members\u201f) desks that they were going to be seeing them each time \nand they would be seeing that smoking is a big deal for the North East.\u201f (AP6) \n \nAn indicator that five advisory panel members mentioned as pointing to early success \nof the partnership activity was a significant shift in public opinion on the desirability of smoke \nfree public places during the lobbying campaign for the Health Bill. Survey research \ncommissioned by SFNE to measure the success of their early publicity and media campaigns, \nfirst in May 2005, and again in December 2005, showed that public support in the North East \nfor smoke free pubs increased from 55% to 66% during this time (Swift Research, 2005; \nFresh-SFNE, 2006: 28), compared to 2004, when the support for smoke free pubs was 47% \n(Fresh-SFNE, 2006: 19). This research was used in lobbying for the Health Act 2006 to \ncounter the assumption that the majority of voters would be opposed to the legislation.  \n 13 \nMany of these activities speak to SFNE\u201fs ability to reach a wide range of people and \ngalvanise public opinion. They also reflect SFNE\u201fs ability to get the right message by the \nright messenger to the right audience at the right time. This may involve quiet words or letters \nby respected colleagues to community leaders, social marketing campaigns, or large-scale \nlobbying efforts (cf. WHO, 2004). Certainly, advisory panel members were in little doubt \nabout the effectiveness of the SFNE lobbying campaign: \n \n\u201e...have they been effective in doing what they set out to do? I would say it\u201fs been \nprobably the most successful campaign that\u201fs been run on a regional basis...  It has \nbeen visible and has had a very positive response and attitudes have been consolidated \nas a result of their activity. So, I would use the (SFNE) campaign and the way in \nwhich it\u201fs been built up as an exemplar for the future and a lot of lessons to be learnt.\u201f \n(AP11) \n \n\u201eThe (Easington pub survey)\u2026was coming at the government from all sides, including \nthe health scrutiny committee\u2026I do think that the work of the North East was a major \nfactor in making sure (the legislation) did go through.\u201f (RA4) \n \n\u201eThe campaign has done an awful lot to raise people\u201fs awareness about what smoking \nmeans to working people.\u201f (AP8) \n \nThirteen thought the SFNE campaign was particularly effective.  Two were uncertain, having \njoined the advisory panel after the campaign was won. \n \n 14 \nThe partnership \n \nOf the 15 advisory panel members interviewed, nine expressed an enthusiasm for SFNE and \nthe advisory panel that would be the envy of many partnerships, and one felt too involved to \nbe able to express an objective opinion.  The other five were generally positive, but had \nconcerns either about how strategic decisions were implemented (two cases) or about the role \nof their organisation in the partnership (three cases). Two in this last category were too new to \nthe panel to be able to express a strong opinion, but the ambivalence of their organisation to \nSFNE\u201fs aims and objectives, identified during participant observation, helps explain this.  \nBecause they and their organisations considered the advisory panel to be a low priority, they \nhad been delegated to take on the role by previous members from their organization. Of the \nfive that were not interviewed, three expressed a highly favourable opinion of the panel in \nother observed contexts or informal conversation, one expressed a generally favourable \nopinion of the partnership, but with some concerns for its management, while the fifth, \nalthough supportive of its aims, was not sufficiently involved with the panel to express an \nopinion on its day to day operation.  None of the panel members said that the panel was \ndysfunctional as a partnership or should be dismantled or radically altered.  \nAnother way of measuring the success of the partnership iss the degree of active \npursuit of SFNE aims outside the advisory panel meetings. Sixteen advisory panel members \nwere actively working to establish TC priorities in their organisations and had lent their \nexpertise and status to SFNE to strengthen its influence in the region. (The degree to which \nthe other four members were actively introducing the TC agenda into their organisations is \nunknown). One representative had set up a smoke free working group in his own workplace \nindependently of his advisory panel duties and, as a medical expert, was a useful and \nknowledgeable spokesman to the press and in the House of Commons. Another advisory \n 15 \npanel member had been involved in regional politics in a variety of roles for many years and, \nas a result, was particularly well-connected. SFNE office staff often asked him to identify and \nfacilitate contact with key decision-makers in political, industry and health sectors on behalf \nof SFNE. Advisory panel members were regularly asked to recruit members of their \norganisations to write letters to decision-makers, disseminate information and campaign \nmaterials and identify problems or opportunities and bring them back to SFNE for \nconsultation. \nMost members were highly experienced, well connected and with expertise in a \nvariety of related fields, for instance an elected councillor was also the director of a voluntary \ncommunity organisation and had a background in health, while the regional assembly \nrepresentative had a background in business, but had also been a non-executive director of a \nprimary care organisation and was involved with a mental health trust.  \nFourteen members had experience with a wide array of partnerships; several expressed \nthe view, and none dissented from the view, that the SFNE advisory panel a uniquely \neffective example: \n \n\u201eIt\u201fs the one body that brings together all the different strands\u2026the (different) strands \nwould have lingered on and done some stuff but it wouldn\u201ft have been so good and it \nwouldn\u201ft have been as successful and as well coordinated\u2026and it certainly wouldn\u201ft \nhave been fitted into some bigger strategy.\u201f (AP12) \n \n\u201eWhat is Smoke Free North East? I think it\u201fs principally a campaign which has very \nclear objectives about improving health in the region.  I think it\u201fs a very good brand \nand I think it\u201fs a very good partnership.\u201f (AP8) \n \n 16 \n\u201eI think what...has been good...is...(that they\u201fve) built a dialogue with the trade unions \nand other sectors which have a role to play and have an interest, but aren\u201ft part of the \nusual suspects when it comes to public health partnerships.  I couldn\u201ft see another way \nof those organisations being engaged at a sufficiently senior level for this to have \nmade any kind of impact in the past.\u201f (AP14) \n \nManagers Speaking Emotions \n \nThe topic of this paper was first identified during a quarterly advisory panel meeting in June \n2006. During a review of the previous year, members took turns making glowing speeches \nabout the partnership managers (SFNE office staff), their fellow advisory panel members and \nthe achievements of the first year. One member stated that this case was the most effective of \nthe approximately twelve partnerships that he sat on. Similar statements were made at \nexternal meetings, for instance with the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of England during her \nfact-finding visit to the region in May 2006 when she met with representatives of SFNE. \n On the basis of such assertions by our participants and in keeping with the action \nresearch method, we chose to develop and carry out semi-structured interviews on the issue. \nAs expected from studies on emotional expression in professional contexts (Coupland et al, \n2008; Vince, 2006), these high level managers generally expressed their emotional \nengagement within the context of concrete cause and effect relationships. Thus much of the \ndata about emotion emerged during the discussion of the following themes:  \n \n1) a uniquely independent organisational structure that straddles boundaries;  \n2) the clear aims and goal-oriented focus of panel activities;  \n3) the collaborative leadership skills of SFNE office staff; \n 17 \n4) The presence of trust and positive relationships between partners. \n  \nThese factors are often the subject of partnership evaluation tools and studies (Hudson et al, \n1999; Huxham and Vangen, 2005; Harrison et al, 2003; Hardy et al, 2003).  In this case, they \nleft partners feeling engaged and useful and helped them to fulfil both personal and \norganisational aspirations. We shall discuss each of these themes in more detail. \n \nStraddling boundaries \n \nSFNE is coordinated by an office that is intentionally positioned on the boundaries between \nthe NHS, national government and local government, and seven advisory panel members \ntalked about the unique autonomy of SFNE.  It is currently jointly funded by the region\u201fs \nprimary care organisations (NHS) and the Department of Health (national government), and \nits offices are situated in the Chester-le-Street District Council headquarters (local \ngovernment).  Although the budget is handled by Northumberland Care Trust, it is managed \non a daily basis by the SFNE Director and overseen by a joint committee representing \nNorthumberland Care Trust, Chester-le-Street District Council and Government Office for the \nNorth East.  Thus, the office serves as a crucial structural bridge between the different \n\u201emonolithic\u201f sectors that are involved, effectively smoothing over the \u201enon-coterminosity\u201f and \n\u201efragmentation of responsibilities\u201f that are too often barriers to effective partnerships (Hudson \net al, 1999). \n This unique position has allowed SFNE to engage in activities and work in a way that \nthe contributing organisations would not have been able to do.  \n \n 18 \n\u201e..having it sufficiently at arm\u201fs length from health was very important\u2026for its ability \nto articulate a view without running into [the] danger of being stamped on by [the] \nDepartment of Health for saying inconvenient things\u201f (AP13) \n \nSFNE is also adaptable and able to react quickly to particular challenges, such as \nquickly reprioritising in order to create an effective lobbying campaign, or being able to \napprove funds in a streamlined manner for materials, research or staff: \n \n\u201eNow the  way the Councils and the NHS like projects to run is that you have a linear \nplan: you go in there, you do these actions over the next six months and you stop and \n(assess), then move on to the next bit. Whereas things (at SFNE) are done on the \nhoof\u2026and I think that\u201fs really valuable because it\u201fs moved faster than we anticipated.  \nThe solid NHS-type body would have struggled to come to terms with the fluidity of \nthe last year and a half.\u201f (AP12) \n \nFor the advisory panel members, however, the crucial point was that SFNE could take \non board suggestions, advice or requests for support from panel members without having to \nengage in lengthy approval processes.  As a result, they could see their suggestions being \nimplemented, thereby feeling that their time was meaningfully spent and that their input was \nvalued. One member of the advisory panel expressed this point vividly:   \n  \n\u201eSo often\u2026you get these big committees ...and at least half the time they spend \ndiscussing what their reporting arrangements are and what their governance structures \nare and how they operate and who they\u201fre accountable to etc. etc. We haven\u201ft had any \nof those discussions, we\u201fve been...very task orientated. Which has been hugely \n 19 \nrefreshing from my point of view.  I wouldn\u201ft have stuck around if all we\u201fd done was \nsit around and talk about who we\u201fre accountable to and how do we make sure we \nreport back properly to people about the use of money and so on.  That would be \ncompletely tedious!\u201f (AP10) \n \n This is not to say that governance issues have been ignored.  As one panel member \nwrote when feeding back on initial results: \n \n\u201eWe actually spent focused time before SFNE came into being working on the \ngovernance aspects.  In other words, while we didn\u201ft \u201cwaste\u201d time once people were \naround the table working on the structural aspects, neither did they occur just by \nchance.\u201f (AP14) \n \n The unusual expenditure and independent management structure has, if anything, \ncontributed to greater accountability than many other more costly, but less innovative, \ninitiatives: \n \n\u201e...it is an incredibly small proportion of the budget that the PCOs [Primary Care \nOrganisations] are spending, [but] they end up scrutinising and putting in enormous \npersonal hours dealing with that rather than the bulk of the spend.\u201f (AP6) \n \nClear Aims \n \nTen advisory panel members mentioned their ability to be able to work towards a clear and \nfinite goal as important (three did not mention, two disagreed). Internationally, nationally and \n 20 \nregionally, TC has developed a clear strategy and targets that are repeatedly communicated by \nthe SFNE Office.  Huxham (1996) argues, however, that goals must not be too narrow, since \nthis leaves little scope for individuals and organisations to interpret and tailor them to meet \ntheir own needs and priorities. In this case, SFNE seems to have found the proper balance \nbetween these two issues. The partners know what they are working towards and are able to \nevaluate their organisation\u201fs potential contribution.  This was mentioned by members as \nmaking their organisations feel \u201euseful\u201f and \u201evaluable\u201f.   \n \n\u201e...we (sometimes) get invited to get involved (with partnerships) because...it will look \ngood on the marketing literature (and) that\u201fs the lot.  (But) there\u201fs none of that (with \nSFNE).\u201f (AP1) \n \n\u201eWe\u201fve managed to come up with things that (our organisation) can do, like it would \nbe good if (a member) had a report on tobacco and agreed to champion it.  It would be \nuseful if the chairman wrote to local authorities, so (they\u201fve been) given something \nthat they would be happy to agree to that\u201fs been very tangible.\u201f (RA4) \n \n\u201e(At a meeting), I asked the director, \u201cWhat impact will our profession make?\u201d And \nshe said, \u201cWe\u201fre aiming for ten per cent (drop in smoking prevalence), a ban will be \nfour per cent and (your contribution would be five per cent spread over several \ninterventions), that was phenomenally helpful getting my profession on board.\u201f \n(AP12) \n \n 21 \n\u201eI think we recognise that people have all sorts of different experiences and roles... the \nway I feel is that I bring a wider range of skills than you would normally expect from \n(someone in my position).\u201f (AP10) \n \nThe interviewees also mentioned that they have been challenged to develop new skills.  \nFor instance, three advisory panel members went to Parliament to lobby, an activity that they \nstated was highly motivational for them as individuals. Media training has been offered to all \nmembers and five of those that took up the opportunity mentioned this as a significant feature \nof their own professional development, which in turn increased their commitment to SFNE \n(ten did not mention it).  In exchange, having experts on a wide variety of issues, from \nenvironmental health officers to public personalities with a personal story, all able to speak \nabout the importance of TC measures in their areas of expertise is a particularly effective \nlobbying and media strategy for SFNE (Hooker and Chapman, 2006).   \n \nManagement and Leadership \n \nNine mentioned the attitudes and work of office staff as being crucial to keeping them \nengaged (two mentioned both positives and negatives). During the planning stage, a debate \nwas had about the type of director that would be most appropriate for SFNE.  Some felt that a \nsenior \u201eheavy hitter\u201f would be the best way of lending SFNE credibility and giving it \nsufficient political clout.  In the end, however, it was decided that advisory panel members \ncould lend that clout and seniority, that it would be better to hire a knowledgeable and \npassionate TC specialist with networking and communication skills, in other words a \n\u201ecatalytic leader\u201f (Barnes et al, 2005: 95).  One element of this catalytic leadership style is \n\u201ethe application of interpersonal skills to relate to and successfully motivate others\u201f (Barnes et \n 22 \nal, 2005: 95), and indeed SFNE office staff have put considerable care and attention into \ndeveloping and maintaining good relationships. This has been an important factor in the \ndynamic of the partnership: \n \n\u201e...they could have gone for the director to be some figurehead-type person who was \na...captain of industry and they\u201fd transfer their leadership and management skills to \nsomething they\u201fve never managed before.  Had they (done that), they would have been \nlike an empty shell, chairing meetings and perhaps it wouldn\u201ft have come from the \nheart as much as with (the directors)...But (the staff) have a good track record working \nwith people and in roles that require a bit of humility as well...they\u201fve come from a \ncollaborative type background, rather than a directive type background.\u201f (AP12) \n \n\u201e(The director) has been very effective and meticulous about making people feel \nvalued for their contribution. The most excellent management techniques are (those) \nthat don\u201ft feel like management techniques and she\u201fs got lots of those.\u201f (AP13) \n \nThe relationships that work best in the advisory panel are those in which the panel \nmembers and the director are in regular contact with each other outside of the panel meetings. \nThis often involves giving the members a reason to engage, such as the director asking them \nfor assistance or giving them particular tasks.  Panel members feel that their time is well \nspent, that they are appreciated and that they are effective, encouraging greater contribution to \nthe process:   \n \n\u201eRegular contact between (office) staff and advisory helps.  I don\u201ft think that a day \ngoes by that I don\u201ft get an e-mail from one of them about something or other.  I don\u201ft \n 23 \nread all of them, but it\u201fs useful as a kind of reminder that we\u201fre here and we\u201fre doing \nthis work.  That helps to keep the concept in my mind. Particularly (in my job), we\u201fre \nrepresentatives on [wave of the hand]...for instance I\u201fm a member of \u2026 [another] \nCommittee, which meets 2-3 times per year and I honestly don\u201ft give a moment\u201fs \nthought to\u2026[that committee] outside of that meeting.\u201f (AP10) \n \n\u201eI think the quality of how (the work) is managed in terms of the relationships between \nthe partners and in terms of what the partners are expected to do and the quality of \nservice from the office make it very easy for partners to play their role effectively.\u201f \n(AP8) \n \nThus the positive dynamics are not merely a question of luck, but are at least partly \ndue to time and resources dedicated by staff with particular skills. A failure to devote \nsufficient resources or time to partnerships has been cited as one of their most common \ndownfalls (Huxham, 1996: 248) and in this time of tight budgets and redundancies, there is \nsome concern that posts devoted primarily to supporting collaboration are more at risk than \nother posts. \n \nTrust and Relationships \n \n\u201eGood relationships\u201f (AP10) and \u201ethe right people\u201f (AP4) were mentioned by seven panel \nmembers one was ambivalent). Most attributed this to luck, as one member put it \u201eit\u201fs almost \nlike a dating agency for work, isn\u201ft it? If I could tell you how to make that happen, I would \nmake a fortune, wouldn\u201ft I?\u201f (AP3). In fact, this is a neglected, but not entirely overlooked, \nissue in the literature on partnerships. Like AP3, Harrison et al (2003) compare partnership \n 24 \nworking to romantic relationships. They acknowledge the centrality of one-on-one \nrelationships to partnership working (2003:28) and consider \u201etrust, respect, honesty and \nshared risk-taking\u201f to be the fundamental qualities of functioning partnership relationships \n(ibid). This is a slightly different perspective to that of much of the work on partnerships.  For \ninstance Hudson et al (1999: 248-50) and Huxham and Vangen (2005: 66) focus more on the \nsingle issue of trust, of which personal relationships are seen as only one aspect. However, \nour participants were clear\u2014relationships are central: \n \n\u201eThere\u201fs a whole lot written (about partnerships), (but) it\u201fs really about people \nworking with other people and wanting to work with other people.\u201f (AP12)  \n \nTrust was clearly present between advisory panel members: \n \n\u201eThey\u201fre all positive people, they\u201fre quite keen to get involved and they are prepared \nto put the time and effort or finance into it in their own field of expertise and provide \ntime towards the partnership for the greater good.\u201f (AP4) \n \n\u201eIf you get a selection of 12 or 15 people...in most circumstances...there\u201fll be elements \nof clashes and blockers, but we don\u201ft seem to have that.  We seem to have a roomful \nof people who are willing to volunteer ideas, to contribute, to give their time and are \nalso open-minded and excited about other people\u201fs ideas.\u201f (AP13) \n \nComments such as \u201ethey\u201fre all positive people\u201f or \u201eare open-minded and excited about \nother people\u201fs ideas\u201f speak to an emotional dynamic that goes beyond trust, however. These \n 25 \npeople clearly like each other and enjoy working with each other. Trust was part of the \nrelationship, but there was a larger emotional dynamic: \n \n\u201eIt\u201fs one of the things with partnerships, you know, a lot of people think they\u201fre just \nmechanisms, but actually it\u201fs all about people. Having somebody who smiles at you \nand says \u201cHello, mate!\u201d when you walk into the room makes you feel much more of a \npartnership than somebody whose got their head down and \u201cYou\u201fre agenda eight,\u201d and \nignores you until agenda item eight. It\u201fs felt very inclusive and welcoming, which has \nbeen why people are willing to do a bit more voluntary work towards it than towards \nother (groups) that they\u201fve been involved in.\u201f (AP12) \n \nThe advisory panel members\u201f descriptions went beyond the long-term, safe, trusting \npartnerships advocated in the literature, instead describing a working partnership with \n\u201eenergy\u201f, and \u201efizz\u201f with which participants \u201ewant to be involved because it feels an effective \nand successful body\u201f (AP13).   \n \nEmotional Engagement and Grassroots Movement Building \n \nTwo advisory panel members said that the SFNE partnership had a \u201egrassroots feel\u201f. In April \n2006, SFNE office staff had their annual planning day. During this meeting, several \ndocuments were discussed, including the American Cancer Society\u201fs \u201eStrategy Planning for \nTobacco Control Movement Building\u201f (2003b). This document, based on the lessons learned \nby the grassroots campaigners who founded the TC  movement in various US states, includes \ntips on how to organize successful TC coalitions. The staff talked about how helpful they had \n 26 \nfound the guide and how the tenor and approach of the guide underpinned their own approach \nto their work.  \nThe guide offers a concrete indication of how and why the emotional dynamics of this \npartnership differed from the careful, trusting, incremental approach advocated in the \nliterature. For example, in suggesting that coordinators should \u201elead\u201f rather than \u201emanage\u201f: \n \n\u201eLeaders are movers and shakers, original, inventive, unpredictable, imaginative, full \nof surprises\u2026. Managers, on the other hand, are safe, conservative, predictable, \nconforming\u2026team players, dedicated to the establishment.\u201f (American Cancer Society \n2003: 58) \n \nThe guide is full of strongly emotive assertions about TC and the requirements for \nbeing successful at it. For instance, it describes the different kinds of people necessary for a \nsuccessful campaign: \n \n\u201e[A] sparkplug [is a] small energy source that ignites a whole engine and sets it in \nmotion. Sparkplugs can ignite a movement, coalition or organisation and keep energy \nflowing through it.\u201f (ibid: 51) \n \n\u201eVisionaries make campaigns \u201ctake flight\u201d.\u201f (ibid: 52) \n \n\u201eMovement builders reach out to draw in. They recruit more members and make them \nfeel welcomed, valued and needed\u201f (ibid: 53) \n \n 27 \nA common problem with partnership working is the tendency for partnerships to try to \naccommodate the different structures, plans, and norms of the different organisations \ninvolved, making partnerships slow and cumbersome (Huxham 1996). The American Cancer \nSociety document, on the other hand, exhorts that \u201eplanning is the enemy of opportunity\u201f and \nthat TC coalitions should \u201econtinually re-set the agenda for action.\u201f (2003b: 59). By creating a \nboundary-straddling structure that was largely independent of the bureaucratic processes of its \nlarge member organisations, SFNE was able to respond more quickly to new opportunities. \nThis made the partners felt engaged, valued and enthusiastic. \nFar from gradually building trust by taking on \u201emodest, low-risk initiatives\u201f (Huxham \nand Vangen 2005: 154) or \u201esmall wins\u201f (Hudson et al, 1999: 253), the SFNE advisory panel \ntook the advice of the TC movement building literature and took a big risk (American Cancer \nSociety 2003: 59) by putting the majority of its resources into campaigning for the Health Act \n2006 from the beginning. This big risk paid off, not only by handing them a big win on the \nissue that they were united around, but also by uniting the partners in an exhilarating and \npersonally challenging endeavour. It is true that they might have failed, but the grassroots \nmovement also has tactics to handle failure, notably to dig in further and fight harder, with \nmore passion and more creativity (Stout 1996; Staples 2004). \nBy constantly reiterating the big dreams of the TC movement, by talking about \nsuccess stories elsewhere in the world, by greeting advisory panel members warmly, by \nphoning them to ask their advice on particular issues, the SFNE office staff were following \nthe American Cancer Society\u201fs exhortation to be \u201esparkplugs\u201f, \u201evisionaries\u201f and \u201emovement \nbuilders\u201f. In so doing, they drew in and engaged the professionals in refreshing ways that, by \ntheir own admission, made them more likely to come to meetings and volunteer extra work. \nIt is a common tenet of grassroots campaigning that by creating a dynamic that is \nwelcoming, energetic, and appealing, people will become more committed, more trustworthy \n 28 \nand more productive. They therefore intentionally use mechanisms to increase positive \nemotions and to encourage participation. However, this is more often recognised at the citizen \nparticipation end of collaboration, rather than in the context of how senior level professionals \nare engaged, since the latter are expected to be dispassionate, responsive to rationality and \nprofessional atmospheres (Fineman, 2000a: 10; van Stokkom, 2005: 401-02; Coupland et al, \n2008 ).  \n \nConcerns \n \nAlthough the advisory panel has worked so far as an example of effective partnership \nworking, there are some concerns that are worth highlighting here. One concern mentioned by \ntwo panel members is the low level of public involvement.  Although the public is \nmeaningfully engaged through the local alliances, there were only two voluntary sector \nrepresentatives on the advisory panel and, as one was a thoracic consultant, only one could be \nconsidered a \u201enon-expert\u201f. Their kind of input is often couched in terms that the coordinators \nhave found difficult to incorporate in their \u201eevidence-based\u201f approach. This problem is by no \nmeans unique to SFNE or to partnerships.  Moreover it is too complex to be addressed here.  \nHowever, there needs to be more recognition that members of the public may require extra, or \nat least a different kind, of effort to incorporate them into partnerships in a meaningful way. \nFour members flagged up the need to widen the funding base as a potential problem \nfor the advisory panel.  At the moment, the funding comes from two sectors of its \nmembership, the NHS and the Department of Health.  While broadening that funding base \nmight increase the size of the budget and would help to spread the financial burden amongst \npartner organisations, it could also have an impact on the dynamics of the panel:  \n \n 29 \n\u201eThere\u201fs a few of us...who sit there and say \u201cWell, I feel that I can\u201ft really contribute \nto discussions (about issues) that would require financial input\u201d.  I don\u201ft feel right in \nactually saying \u201cYes, I think you should spend the money this way,\u201d because it\u201fs not \nmy money in the first place.\u201f (AP3) \n \n\u201eI asked, \u201cDo we have a vote on this board, because they\u201fre providing the money?\u201d \nAnd we were told \u201cYes\u201d, but I\u201fm still not comfortable about it...we did have a bit of a \nquestion mark over whether we had a legitimate right to do that.\u201f (AP4) \n \nFor these respondents, having a wide range of funders is not just important for \nobtaining sufficient funds, or increasing the security of funding, but also for improving their \nsense of legitimacy on the panel. \n Finally, of course, the advisory panel is still in its early days.  Whether the partnership \ncan maintain its momentum beyond the boost provided by the \u201ebig win\u201f of the lobbying \ncampaign, whether it can survive the change in direction necessary for the next phase of TC \nactivity, and whether it can maintain the enthusiasm and sense of purpose that now \ncharacterises the meetings remains to be seen. Again, however, the American Cancer Society \ndocument gives guidance on this issue: \u201eFind new initiatives to keep momentum\u201f (2003: 59) it \ncommands, which is exactly what SFNE began working on in 2007. \n \nConclusion \n \nMost commonly identified barriers to partnership working have been effectively addressed by \nSFNE through its governance and managerial arrangements, but from the perspective of its \nadvisory panel members, many of whom are familiar with the grey literature on partnerships, \n 30 \nit is the personal relationships and emotional engagement that make or break a partnership.  \nThese factors are notoriously difficult to intentionally create and to pin down, perhaps helping \nto explain their relative marginalisation in the literature. In this case, rather than turning to \npopular management literature, which attempts to control or manage emotions in a \nhierarchical setting (Bolton, 2005: 45-65), the partnership coordinators have taken their lead \nfrom the grassroots movement, which emphasises motivation and integration through equality \nand collaboration.  \nMany partnership evaluations seem to rely primarily on interviews (Audit \nCommission, 2005: 12; ODPM, 2005: Appendix 2) or self-assessment (Hardy et al, 2003).  \nThe interviews in this research were undeniably useful in exploring the perspectives and \nopinions of participants, but were not useful in explaining how and why the relationships \nwork.  However, combined with participant observation and iterative cycles of participant \nfeedback, the key issues that could most usefully be explored in more depth were identified, \nintentionality and causality were elucidated and the correlation of the stated viewpoints with \nactions could be noted.  The cause and effect relationships highlighted were not necessarily \nrecognised by the participants, and hence would not necessarily have been expressed in \ninterviews. In highlighting the importance of relationships and emotional engagement, we are \nnot arguing that good governance and structures have no value.  Indeed, it is clear from the \nexamples given above that good governance, management and structures have facilitated \ngood relationships in this instance.  As one panel member responded when this finding was \nsuggested to him: \n \n\u201eI\u201fd say that SFNE has been approached as a more thought out campaign than most \npartnerships I\u201fve been part of.  The very fact that some people have felt it to be more \n 31 \norganic is a reflection of how well the preparatory\/backroom work paid off\u2014people \ndidn\u201ft feel it to be a restrictively mechanistic approach.\u201f (AP14) \n \nHowever, governance and structures can all too easily become the central focus of \npartnerships, and that \u201emost self-evident and elusive\u201f (Hardy et al, 2003: 28) principle of \nensuring good one-on-one relationships is ignored or forgotten, probably because it is seen as \ntoo difficult to tackle or something that can only be left to chance.  \nThe ethos of grassroots campaigning was explicitly adopted by the SFNE office team \nand had a notable influence: advisory panel members were more likely to come to meetings; \nmore likely to go out of their way to advise the office staff; and more likely to engage with \ntheir own organisations in an effort to further TC goals. Managers of high level partnerships \nshould not assume that the rational justification (\u201ethe incentive\u201f) for involvement in a \npartnership is sufficient to ensure its effectiveness , even for senior level managers and \nprofessionals.  Rather, they should take a lesson from the grassroots organizing manuals and \nrecognize one-to-one relationships as the key means to \u201emotivate, integrate, facilitate, educate \nand activate\u201f (Staples 2004). \n \nAcknowledgements  \n \nThis research was funded by the National Prevention Research Initiative (Grant No. \nG0501277) (www.npri.org).
