Because of the\nmarked heterogeneity and poor quality of reporting of the\nincluded trials, the place of stenting in the management\nof patients after uncomplicated ureteroscopy remains\nunclear.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe surgical management of ureteric stones has chan-\nged over the past few decades because of advances in\ninstruments and techniques.1 Extracorporeal shock\nwave lithotripsy (ESWL) and ureteroscopy are cur-\nrently the most common treatment options in clinical\npractice. The routine placement of ureteric stents after\nfragmentation and retrieval of ureteroscopic stones is\nquestionable.w1 w2 The main advantages of stenting are\nthe prevention of ureteric obstruction and renal pain\nthat may develop as a result of ureteric oedema from\nballoon dilation or stonemanipulation during uretero-\nscopy.Ureteric stentsmay aid in thepassageof residual\nstone fragments secondary to the passive ureteric dila-\ntion that occurs with an indwelling ureteric stent2 and\nmay prevent delayed formation of ureteric stricture.\nRoutine placement of ureteric stents, however, is\naccompanied by recognised potentially troublesome\nurinary symptoms or morbidity, or both.3 4 Related\ncomplications such as migration, infection, pyelone-\nphritis, breakage, encrustation, and stone formation\nare not uncommon.5 Placement of ureteric stents\nresults in additional costs. Furthermore, unless a pull\nstring is routinely used at the distal end of the stent,\nsecondary cystoscopy is required to remove the stent,\nwhich has cost implications and the potential to add to\nthe disruption of patients\u2019 lives.\nUreteroscopy is now performed with small calibre\nendoscopes and better intracorporeal lithotripsy\ndevices such as holmium laser so that most patients\ncan be treated without ureteric dilation. As a result,\nthe need for a postprocedural stent remains question-\nable.\nWe determined the evidence that outcomewith rou-\ntine ureteric stent placement after uncomplicated ure-\nteroscopy is inferior to that without stent placement.\nMETHODS\nSearch strategy\nWe obtained relevant trials from the Cochrane renal\ngroup\u2019s specialised register of randomised controlled\ntrials; the Cochrane central register of controlled trials\n2006; Medline and PreMedline (1966 to 31 January\n2006); Embase (1980 to 31 January 2006); reference\nlists of urology textbooks, review articles, and relevant\ntrials; and abstracts of conference proceedings.\n1Academic Urology Unit, Institute of\nApplied Health Sciences, College of\nLife Sciences and Medicine,\nUniversity of Aberdeen, Health\nSciences Building, Aberdeen AB25\n2ZD\n2Health Services Research Unit,\nInstitute of Applied Health\nSciences, College of Life Sciences\nand Medicine, University of\nAberdeen\nCorrespondence to: G Nabi g.\nnabi@abdn.ac.uk\ndoi: 10.1136\/bmj.39119.595081.55\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 7\nCite this article as: BMJ, doi:10.1136\/bmj.39119.595081.55 (published 20 February 2007) \n Copyright 2007 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd\n on 5 April 2007 bmj.comDownloaded from \nTo be included randomised controlled trials had to\ncompare stenting with no stenting after uncomplicated\nureteroscopy in adults with a clinical diagnosis of ure-\nteric stone who required intervention or who were\nundergoing diagnostic or therapeutic ureteroscopy\nfor upper tract transitional cell carcinoma and had at\nleast one of the predetermined outcomes of interest.\nOutcome measures\nOutcomes of interest were pain rated by patients on a\nvalidated scale, need for analgesia, lower urinary tract\nsymptoms, unplanned medical visits or admission to\nhospital, complications related to the stent (such as\nmigration, encrustation, fragmentation, ureteric ero-\nsion, and fistulas), return to normal physical activities,\nparticipants\u2019 satisfaction, health economics and health\nrelated quality of life. Trials reporting on pain were\nclassified into two groups: those that reported pain\nscore within or at three days or those that reported\npain at or after day seven after the procedure.\nQuality assessment and data abstraction\nTwo reviewers (GN, SMcC) independently assessed\nstudy quality using the checklist developed for the\nCochrane renal group.6 Discrepancies were resolved\nby discussion and arbitration by a third party if neces-\nsary. They assessed concealment of allocation, inten-\ntion to treat analysis, completeness of follow-up, and\nblinding of investigators, participants, and outcome\nassessors.\nThey screened identified titles and abstracts inde-\npendently. Potentially relevant trials were retained\nand the full text examined. The reviewers indepen-\ndently extracted data. When important data were not\nreported, we tried to contact the authors.\nStudy characteristics and quantitative data synthesis\nWhenever possible, we classified the studies by size\nand site of stones and type of ureteroscope and intra-\ncorporeal lithotripsy device used. When two or more\nstudies reported on the same outcome we quantita-\ntively combined results. We calculated relative risks\nfor dichotomous data and weighted mean differences,\nwith 95% confidence intervals, for continuous data. A\nfixed effects model (Mantel-Haenszel) was used unless\ntherewas evidence of substantial statistical heterogene-\nity, in which case we used the DerSimonian and Laird\nrandom effects model. Statistical heterogeneity of\ntreatment effects between studies was formally tested\nwith Cochran\u2019s test for heterogeneity (P<0.1). The I 2\nstatistic was also examined.7 We explored possible\nsources of heterogeneity (participants, treatments,\nstudy quality).Whenwe could not combine data quan-\ntitatively they were assessed qualitatively. All meta-\nanalyses were performed using RevMan software (ver-\nsion 4.2.8).\nRESULTS\nOf 34 potentially relevant studies, we excluded 24 after\nreviewing abstracts (fig 1). We retrieved 10 articles for\nmore detailed evaluation and excluded one that did\nnot meet our inclusion criteria,8 leaving nine trials for\nthe review.w1-w9\nStudy characteristics\nThe nine trials were conducted in eight countries,\nreported on 831 participants, and were published in\n2001-4 (table 1). The reported length of hospital stay\nafter ureteroscopy varied from a few hours as an\noutpatientw1 w4 to two to three days.w7 w9 In two trials\nhospital stay varied on a case-to-case basis,w3 w6 but ure-\nteroscopy was mostly an outpatient procedure with a\nfew patients requiring overnight hospital stay. Two\ntrials reported hospital stays of one day.w2 w5 One trial\ndid not report on postoperative hospital stay.w8\nSeven studies included participants irrespective of\nthe site of stones in the ureterw1 w2 w4-w8 and a few selec-\ntively recruited participants with stones in the lower\nureter.w3 w9 There was no significant difference in\nstone size between the groups that did or did not\nreceive a stent. Participants with intraoperative ure-\nteric perforation or any other complications that other-\nwise would have required postprocedural placement\nof a ureteric stent were specifically excluded from the\ntrials. One trial included participants after diagnostic\nor therapeutic ureteroscopy for transitional cell carci-\nnoma of ureter or pelvicalyceal system.w4\nOne trial mentioned the material of the ureteric\nstents used.w2 Size of stents used varied from 6 French\ngaugew2 w3 w4 w6 w9 to 7 French gauge,w5 w7 but two stu-\ndies did not specify size.w1 w8 All trials except two\nused semirigid or rigid ureteroscopes ranging in size\nfrom 6.0 to 9.5 French gauge. One trial routinely\nused a 7.4 French gauge flexible ureteroscope for\nupper ureteric stonesw1 while another did so\noccasionally.w4 Two studies carried out ureteral dilata-\ntion in both groups before the introduction of the\nureteroscope.w3 w9 One study excluded participants\nwho required dilatation.w4 In three trials ureteral dila-\ntation to facilitate ureteroscopy was not\nrequired.w5 w6 w8 Different sources of intracorporeal\nlithotripsywere used for fragmentation of large calculi,\nincluding holmium:YAG (yttrium-aluminium-garnet)\nlaser,w1 w3 w4 w6 electromechanical,w7 w9\nelectrohydraulic,w5 and ultrasonic lithotrite.w8\nMost of the included trials failed to meet our quality\ncriteria because of lack of information rather than\nPotentially relevant trials identified and screened (n=34)\nRetrieved for more detailed evaluation (n=10)\nTrials excluded: not randomised controlled trial\nor no comparison of stents v no stents (n=24)\nTrials included in meta-analysis (n=9)\nTrials excluded: no randomisation (n=1)\nFig 1 | Flow of studies in the systematic review\nRESEARCH\npage 2 of 7 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\n on 5 April 2007 bmj.comDownloaded from \nexplicit reporting of methods that did not conform to\nthe criteria. The trial designs were heterogeneous with\nregard to ureteroscope sizes, intracorporeal lithotripsy\ndevices, postoperative analgesia, and outcome assess-\nment and reporting. Only one trial reported on blind-\ning (table 2).\nPatients\u2019 outcomes\nPatients\u2019 pain scores\u2014Five trials measured pain scores at\nvariable intervals after the procedure: at day one,w9\ndays one and three,w6 only at day three,w5 at days\nthree, seven, and 15,w2 and at one, six, and 12 weeks.\nw1 They all used a 10 cm visual analogue scale with 0\nrepresenting no pain and 10 representing severe pain.\nExperimental studies inminipigs have reported persis-\ntent mechanical ureteric oedema and urinary tract\nobstruction up to 96 hours after dilatation,9 suggesting\nthat the cause of flank pain in the first three days after\nureteroscopy is multifactorial and not caused by stents\nalone. Two trials reported no significant difference in\npain scores within three days of the procedure between\nthe groups,w5 w9 whereas one trial favoured those with-\nout stents within three days of the procedure.w2 There\nwas evidence of substantial heterogeneity between stu-\ndies for pain scores between both immediate (within or\nat three days) and delayed (seven days) postoperative\nperiods. Because of the large degree of heterogeneity\nwe could not pool data. One trial reported a signifi-\ncantly higher pain score at four weeks in those with\nstents,w3 whereas two trials reported no significant dif-\nference at two and 12weeks after the procedure.w1 w2 In\ntwo studies the reported data were not suitable for\ninclusion in the meta-analysis,w3 w4 with both trials\nreporting a higher pain score in participants with\nstents. In one other trial the method of pain measure-\nment was not clear,w7 though it reported no significant\ndifference in pain perception between groups.\nRequirement of analgesia\u2014Four trials reported on the\nrequirement for analgesia after ureteroscopic removal\nof ureteric stones.w1 w6-w8 None of these studies found\nany significant difference in the proportion of partici-\npants who required analgesia after ureteroscopy with\nor without stents. Only two trials gave data suitable for\nmeta-analysis.w4 w7 There was no difference in use of\nanalgesics between the two groups (relative risk 1.03,\n95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.47).\nLower urinary tract symptoms\u2014Eight trials reported on\nlower urinary tract symptoms at various lengths of fol-\nlow-up.w1-w7 w9 Combined analysis of four of these stu-\ndies that reported urinary frequency or urgency\nshowed a higher rate in participants with stents (2.00,\n1.11 to 3.62; fig 2). There was also a higher rate of hae-\nmaturia (2.18, 0.72 to 6.61) and dysuria (2.25, 1.14 to\n4.43) in those with stents. Data from three trials, which\ncould not be used for meta-analysis, also showed\nhigher rates of lower urinary tract symptoms in those\nwith stents.w1 w3 w4\nUrinary tract infections\u2014Three trials (210 partici-\npants) reported on urinary tract infections.w2 w6 w9 The\npooled analysis showed no significant difference\nbetween the two groups (1.09, 0.48 to 2.47; fig 3).\nOne trial reported significantly more pyuria in the\ninitial postoperative period in those with stents.

In one trial, the reported costs per\npatient were based on hospital charges but had been\nincorrectly calculated.w8 The operation time (min-\nutes), a key cost driver, was consistently longer in\nthe group with stents (weighted mean difference\n5.37, 95% confidence interval 2.37 to 8.36, I 2=0,\nfig 5).w1-w6 w9\nDISCUSSION\nPrincipal findings\nIn this systematic review we found that stenting after\nureteroscopy is associated with increased lower urin-\nary tract symptoms such as dysuria and frequency or\nurgency. We evaluated the benefits, harms, and costs\nof stenting after uncomplicated ureteroscopy, most\ncommonly for the management of ureteric stones.\nUnplanned medical visits and admissions to hospital\nwere more common in the group without stents,\nthough the differences were not significant. The clini-\ncal implication of these findings needs further research\nas the present level of evidence is based on trials with\nmarked clinical heterogeneity because of the use of dif-\nferent sizes of ureteroscopes, different intracorporeal\nlithotripsy devices, and variation in practice and\nexperience. Moreover, the definition of \u201cuncompli-\ncated ureteroscopy\u201d varied between studies. We\ncould not ascertain whether there was a difference in\npostoperative pain because of the small number of stu-\ndies reporting on this and the varied results.\nWe found no significant difference between the\ngroups with and without stents in the need for postpro-\ncedural analgesia, urinary tract infection, stone clear-\nance rates, and ureteric stricture development. These\noutcomes, however, were not reported consistently\nacross the studies. None of the trials reported on health\nrelated quality of life. No trials investigated the impact\nof stent design and material on outcome, especially as\nrelated to quality of life.

In a non-ran-\ndomised study, up to 80% of participants experienced\nurinary symptoms and pain associated with indwelling\nureteric stents, which interfere with daily activities and\nresult in a reduced quality of life.3 Chen et al reported\nreturn to normal physical activity in 80% of partici-\npants on the day after the procedures in both\ngroups.w5\nA few trials reported on cost implications. Not sur-\nprisingly, there was a higher cost associated with use of\nureteric stents, but none of the trials reported on the\ncost effectiveness of this intervention.\nLimitations\nLack of definition of uncomplicated ureteroscopy\u2014Because\nof a lack of standardisation of the definition of \u201cuncom-\nplicatedureteroscopy,\u201d the decisionnot to insert a stent\ncan be difficult. This was evident from the included\ntrials. This decision is often affected by the technique,\ntechnology used, and experience of the operating sur-\ngeon. Denstedt et al defined uncomplicated uretero-\nscopy as no evidence of perforation or lack of\nclinically important oedema.w1 They did not, however,\npropose any objective criteria to assess the clinical\nimportance of any oedema after the procedure but sug-\ngested that free flow of contrast into the bladder on\nretrograde pyelography should rule it out. Other stu-\ndies used an endoscopic, non-validated grading of ure-\nteric trauma and oedema on a scale of 0 (mild) to 2\n(severe).2 w6\nPerformance and reporting of studies\u2014There was a lack\nof standardisation of outcomemeasures, length of trial,\nand duration of stenting. The use of preprocedural\nantibiotics, trial design, stent material, patient popula-\ntion, assessment of health related quality of life, and\ncost-effectiveness data were all inconsistent. Studies\nreported pain scores as means with variance, although\nit is well recognised that data from visual analogue\nscales are often skewed and therefore may be more\naccurately analysed as medians. We were unable to\naccess data from individual patients to assess whether\ncomparison of medians rather than means may have\naltered our findings. Some trials allowed withdrawal\nafter randomisation because of intraoperative\ncomplications,w2 w3 leading to potential reporting bias.\nThe longest follow-up was only six months.w2\nQuality of reporting\u2014The general quality of trials was\npoor (table 2). Some participants were excluded from\nthe analysis in a few trials because of intraoperative\ncomplications, making it difficult to assess the true\neffect of intervention. Most of the trials had small sam-\nple sizes.\nImplications for practice\nAs stent placement after ureteroscopy seems to cause\nundesirable lower urinary tract symptoms maybe it\nshould not be a standard practice. There are, however,\nmany unanswered questions, and any recommenda-\ntions would be potentially flawed because of a lack of\nstandardisation of outcome measures, marked clinical\nheterogeneity, withdrawal after randomisation, impre-\ncision in measurement of outcomes (large confidence\nintervals), and poor reporting of published clinical\ntrials.\nImplications for research\nResearch efforts shouldnowbe concentratedonhigher\nquality, more rigorous randomised trials. As a mini-\nmum, these should use predefined ideally standardised\nmeasures of outcome and be multicentred to ensure\nthat the studies give sufficiently precise estimate of\nthe various outcomes. Trials should be protocol driven\nand a detailed protocol of how the project is to be con-\nducted should be agreed before the start. The protocol\nshould state the research objectives, reasons for the\nstudy, issues related to recruitment (inclusion and\nexclusion criteria), information to be collected at\nentry to the study, and interventions of interest, and\nthere should be an agreed follow-up protocol. Out-\ncome measures must include outcomes assessed by\npatients and ideally health economic outcome mea-\nsures. The impact of variations in stent design, size,\nand material, and the effect of different types of intra-\ncorporeal lithotripsy sources on the requirement for\nstents need to be examined.\nThis review was conducted with substantial support and advice from the\nmembers of Cochrane Incontinence Group, Aberdeen.
