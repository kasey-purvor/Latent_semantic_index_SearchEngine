Globally, this fraction\nis only about 5%, and there is no strong evidence that it is significantly higher in\nclusters. Without an effective sub-grid feedback prescription, the cooled gas fraction\nin any numerical simulation exceeds these observational constraints, and increases\nwith increasing resolution. This compromises any discussion of galaxy and cluster\nproperties based on results of simulations which include cooling but do not implement\nan effective feedback mechanism.\nKey words: galaxies:formation,cooling flows,methods:numerical\n1 INTRODUCTION\nGas cooling in the expanding Universe is an intrinsi-\ncally unstable process because cooling acts to increase\nthe density of the gas, which in turn increases the cool-\ning rate. The consequence of this is that as soon as\nthe gas within a system is able to cool at all it tends\nto do so catastrophically, only regulated by the speed\nat which the gas can respond to the new configura-\ntion. Systems which collapse at low redshift have a low\nmean density and, thus, long cooling times which gen-\nerally exceed their dynamical times. Systems collapsing\nat higher redshifts have a higher mean density and, be-\ncause the cooling rate depends strongly upon the gas\ndensity, they cool much more rapidly. In a Universe\ndominated by cold dark matter (CDM), the hierarchi-\ncal growth of structure consequently results in almost\nall of the baryons cooling by the present day, unless\nadditional physics is considered (Cole 1991; White &\nFrenk 1991; Blanchard et al. 1992).\nUnfortunately, the naive theoretical prediction that\nall the baryonic material in the Universe should have\ncooled into galaxies and formed stars conflicts with the\nobservation of X-ray emission from galaxy clusters. This\nemission demonstrates that large amounts of hot gas\npersist in the Universe. This material can arise from two\npossible sources: either it was never contained within a\ncollapsed halo in which cooling was efficient, or energy\ninjection (for instance feedback of energy due to super-\nnovae) has either reheated or prevented the cooling of\nthe gas. The commonly used theory of Press & Schecter\n(1974) (see also Bower 1991) implicitly assumes that all\nthe matter in the Universe is contained within haloes.\nThe best numerical models (Jenkins et al. 2000) in-\ndicate that the fraction of material contained within\nhaloes is certainly high, and only leave room for a small\nuncollapsed fraction. Therefore, we appeal to feedback\nmechanisms (Larson 1974; White & Rees 1978; Cole\n1991; White & Frenk 1991) to reduce the amount of\ncold gas within collapsed haloes.\nIn this paper we review the observational con-\nstraints on the density of cold and hot baryons, both\nglobally and in rich clusters (\u00a72). These data establish\nthe global cooled gas fraction at fc,global\u2248 0.073h, and\nthere is no convincing evidence that it is much higher\nin clusters. We then examine cosmological simulation\nresults in \u00a73, and show that they can easily cool far\ntoo much gas to be consistent with these data. Finally,\nin \u00a74 we discuss the necessity of combining simulations\nwith analytic, sub-grid physics models, and the merits\nof various initial attempts to do this.\nThroughout this paper, we parametrise the Hubble\nconstant as H\u25e6 = 100h km s\n\u22121 Mpc\u22121. We will need to\nconsider two cosmologies, \u039b CDM (\u2126\u25e6 = 0.3, \u039b = 0.7)\nand standard CDM (\u2126\u25e6 = 1, \u039b = 0). Matter densities\nare given relative to the critical density, and mass-to-\nlight ratios (M\/L) are in solar units.\n2 OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS\n2.1 The Global Fraction of Cold Baryons\nThe mass density of cooled baryons in the form of stars,\n\u2126stars, can be obtained from the observed luminosity\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 Balogh et al.\ndensity (e.g. Blanchard, Valls-Gabaud & Mamon 1992)\nas long as 1) we do not miss a significant contribution\nfrom low surface brightness galaxies; and 2) the mass-\nto-light ratio is well understood. Fortunately, surface\nbrightness is tightly correlated with total luminosity,\nand there does not appear to be a significant contribu-\ntion to the baryon density from low surface brightness\ngalaxies (Driver 1999; Cole et al. 2000). Although there\nis an uncomfortably large range in the Schechter param-\neters of the local optical luminosity function (due to the\nlarge degeneracy between \u03c6\u2217 and L\u2217), Fukugita, Hogan\n& Peebles (1998, hereafter FHP) demonstrate that the\ntotal integrated B\u2212band luminosity is constrained to\nwithin about 15%. However, the use of the optical lu-\nminosity function requires large and uncertain correc-\ntions for the M\/LB ratio, which is sensitive to stellar\npopulations and, thus, must be determined separately\nfor different types of galaxy.\nA more robust estimate is obtained from the\nK\u2212band luminosity function, sinceM\/LK is less sensi-\ntive to star formation history, varying by only a factor\nof about two due to stellar population age differences\n(Bell & de Jong 2000). Recently, Cole et al. (2000b) have\ncomputed the mass function using over 17000 galaxies\nwith redshifts from the 2dF galaxy redshift survey and\nmagnitudes from the 2-micron all sky survey (2MASS).\nFrom the galaxy colours and stellar population synthe-\nsis models they determineM\/LK for each galaxy (inde-\npendent of h). Their (\u039bCDM) result is most sensitive\nto the assumed initial mass function (IMF): for a Ken-\nnicutt (1983) IMF, \u2126stars = 0.0014h\n\u22121, while for the\nSalpeter (1955) IMF, \u2126stars = 0.0026h\n\u22121.\nThe average stellar M\/LK from which Cole et al.\n(2000b) derive \u2126stars is 0.73 and 1.32 for the Kenni-\ncutt and Salpeter IMFs, respectively (independent of\nh). A substantially higher M\/LK would require a large\ncontribution from low mass stars and brown dwarfs. Al-\nthough these objects are likely to be a significant com-\nponent of the mass budget, there is no strong evidence\nthat they are more abundant than expected from stan-\ndard IMFs (Fuchs et al. 1998; Gizis et al. 2000; Lucas\n& Roche 2000). In particular, Reid et al. (1999) claim\nthat brown dwarfs contribute no more than 15% of the\nmass of the Galactic disk. Earlier microlensing results\nwhich suggested that there might be a large population\nof dark objects in the Galaxy halo are no longer com-\npelling, following a reanalysis of the MACHO project\ndata (Alcock et al. 2000).\nDynamical measurements of early type galaxies\n(van der Marel 1991; Bell & de Jong 2000) favour\nM\/LK \u223c< 1.1h; this is an upper limit to the global\naverage because later type galaxies have lower M\/LK .\nWe therefore prefer the estimate of \u2126stars = 0.0014h\n\u22121\nbased on the Kennicutt (1983) IMF with a mean\nM\/LK = 0.73.\nCooled gas is also present in the form of neutral and\nmolecular gas, but these make only small contributions.\nThe density of neutral gas is \u2126atomic \u2248 0.000188h\n\u22121,\nas recently calculated by the HI Parkes All Sky Sur-\nvey (HIPASS) team (Kilborn et al. 1999). For the\namount of gas in molecular form, we adopt the rela-\ntion \u03c1H2\/\u03c1HI = 0.81 used by FHP, gleaned from the\nCO-based compilation of Young & Scoville (1991). To-\ngether, the neutral and molecular gas only represent\n\u223c 10% of the stellar mass, which is the fraction we will\nadopt, so that \u2126cold = 1.1\u2126stars.\nThe total baryon content of the universe is unknown\nobservationally, because baryons in the warm plasma\nphase believed to occupy normal galaxy haloes are very\ndifficult to see (Benson et al. 2000). However, if nu-\ncleosynthesis calculations are correct, the baryon den-\nsity \u2126b can be determined from deuterium abundances.\nThe best current estimate, \u2126b = 0.019h\n\u22122 (Burles\n& Tytler 1998; Burles et al. 2000), therefore implies\nfc,global = \u2126cold\/\u2126b = 0.073h. There are indications,\nfrom recent analysis of the combined BOOMERANG\nand MAXIMA data, that \u2126b is much larger than this,\n\u2126b = 0.039h\n\u22122 (Jaffe et al. 2000), which would reduce\nfc,global by a factor of two.\nIn summary, only about 5% of the available baryons\nin the universe have cooled (for h \u2248 0.7 and a Kennicutt\nIMF). This result is slightly lower than the minimum of\nthe range 0.062 < fc,global < 0.167 found by FHP from\noptical data, but much more certain as it does not rely\non knowing the relative abundances of different galaxies\n(disks, spheroids and irregulars) with very different (and\nuncertain) M\/LB ratios. As we will show in \u00a73, this\nlow value is in stark contrast to the results obtained in\nnumerical simulations which do not employ an adequate\nfeedback model.\n2.2 The Abundance of Hot Baryons\nIn the previous section we claimed that most of the\nbaryons in the Universe are in a warm or hot phase,\nwhich is difficult to observe because it is not hot enough\nto be observable in X-ray radiation (Blanchard et al.\n1992; Dave\u00b4 et al. 2000; Benson et al. 2000). The ex-\nistence of such a warm component is compatible with\nconstraints on the anisotropy of the microwave back-\nground, a long as the gas temperature satisfies the con-\nstraint T < 4h\u00d7 107 K (at z < 1) (Wright et al. 1994).\nIn clusters, however, the same gas is much hotter,\nand is directly observable. As originally shown by White\net al. (1993), the total baryon content of rich clusters,\nincluding this plasma, is fully consistent with \u2126b from\nelement abundance determinations, if \u2126\u25e6 \u2248 0.3. FHP\ncompile data on the baryon contributions in clusters\ndue to stars, cold gas and plasma, and demonstrate\nthat \u2126b\/\u2126\u25e6 = 0.112 \u00b1 0.05 (h = 0.7). In this case,\n\u2126b is a sum of all observed baryons in clusters. Hence,\nfor \u2126\u25e6 = 0.3 \u00b1 0.1, we have that \u2126b = 0.034 \u00b1 0.019\n(h = 0.7) which is consistent with the baryon fraction\ndeduced from deuterium abundances (Burles & Tytler\n1998). Thus, the fact that \u2126stars \u226a \u2126b in the Universe\nis almost certainly a reflection of the fact that the warm\ngas has not been directly observed.\n2.3 The Dependence on Halo Mass\nAlthough we have demonstrated that fc,global\u2248 0.073h,\nit is possible that the cooled fraction in some environ-\nments, rich clusters for example, could be very differ-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n3ent. In particular, Bryan (2000) claims that the effi-\nciency of galaxy formation is dependent on halo mass,\nwith more gas cooling in small haloes, relative to large\nones. Most of the cluster data in the literature has been\nobtained at optical wavelengths, so the correction for\nM\/L variations is not as robust as for the global value\ncomputed from the K-band field luminosity function in\n\u00a72.1. We will use the optimal values from FHP, who\ncompile data from various sources, including dynami-\ncal measurements and population synthesis model es-\ntimates. The M\/LB depends strongly on morpholog-\nical type, and FHP find M\/LB = 6.5\n+1.8\n\u22122.0 for E\/S0\ngalaxies; M\/LB = 1.5 \u00b1 0.4 for spiral galaxies; and\nM\/LB = 1.1\u00b1 0.25 for irregular galaxies. For the mor-\nphological composition of a \u201ctypical\u201d cluster, they de-\ntermine M\/LB = 4.5\u00b1 1, and we will use this number.\nAssuming a pure elliptical population would increase\nstellar mass estimates by \u223c 45%.\nFor low mass clusters and groups, the X-ray data\nonly extend out to a small fraction of the virial radius.\nThis can lead to a strong bias, since the gas distribu-\ntion is less concentrated than the stars (Roussel et al.\n2000). We will consider the cluster and group data re-\ncently compiled by Roussell et al. (2000) specifically for\nthe purpose of addressing this issue. In that paper, care\nwas taken to ensure that stellar and gas masses are com-\nputed to the same radius, and only those clusters for\nwhich the X-ray data extend to at least 25% of the\nvirial radius are considered here. Nonetheless, we warn\nthat the data for groups with kT < 5 keV must be\ntreated with caution, as their gas masses still require a\nsubstantial extrapolation to the virial radius. In addi-\ntion to the standard analysis of the X-ray data, Rous-\nsel et al. also consider hot gas mass estimates based on\nsimulation-motivated scaling laws, which do not require\nan assumption of isothermal, \u03b2\u2212model profiles. We use\nthe measurements made based on the scaling laws of\nBryan & Norman (1998). In addition, we consider the\n15 rich clusters with reliable velocity dispersions from\nthe CNOC sample (Carlberg et al. 1996; Carlberg et al.\n1997), with X-ray data taken from Lewis et al. (1999).\nThe stellar masses are computed from the inte-\ngrated stellar luminosity function, assuming M\/LB =\n4.5, and corrected for undetected galaxies by extrap-\nolating the luminosity function with an assumed faint\nend slope of \u03b1 \u2248 \u22121.2. Finally, we assume that the mass\nof cold baryons is 10% larger than the stellar mass, to\naccount for the presence of neutral and molecular gas\n(see \u00a7 2.1).\nWe consider two approaches to compute fc,cluster\nfromMcold in the clusters. In the first case, we compute\nfc,cluster =Mcold\/(Mcold +Mhot), (1)\nwhere Mhot is determined from the observable X-ray\nemission from the hot plasma, extrapolated to the virial\nradius. This will be valid if the extrapolation is accu-\nrate (less likely for lower mass clusters), and will be\nan overestimate of fc,cluster if there is an unobserved,\nwarm component which does not contribute to the X-\nray emission (as is the case in galactic mass haloes). We\nshow fc,cluster for the two samples in the bottom panel\nof Figure 1, for a \u039bCDM cosmology with h = 0.7. Both\nMcold and Mhot are distance dependent measurements,\nwith Mcold \u221d h\n\u22121 and Mhot \u221d h\n\u22121.5. Since, usually,\nMhot \u226bMcold, fcool \u221d h\n0.5 when calculated from Equa-\ntion 1.\nMost of the fc,cluster values in the bottom panel\nof Figure 1 are higher than the global fraction fc,global\ncomputed in \u00a72.1, shown as the horizontal line. There is\nonly weak evidence for a trend, in the sense that fc,global\nis lower in higher temperature systems. However, this\ntrend is much weaker than suggested by Bryan (2000)\nand, we caution that the kT < 5 keV groups may still\nbe biased toward high fractions because of the limited\nextent of the X-ray data; none of these groups have\nX-ray emission detected beyond half the virial radius.\nAlso, both the random and systematic uncertainties in\nobservationally determiningMhot, especially for the low\ntemperature groups, are large. This is emphasized in\nthe top panel of Figure 1, in which the same data are\nplotted, but fc,cluster is computed as\nfc,cluster =\nMcold\nMtotal\n\u2126\u25e6\n\u2126b\n, (2)\nwhere Mtotal is the total dynamical mass of the clus-\nter, and we take \u2126b from Burles & Tytler (1998).\nThis does not depend on the difficult measurement of\nMhot, but does require an estimate of \u2126\u25e6, which is\n0.3 in our \u039bCDM cosmology. Note that, in this case,\nfc,cluster\u221d \u2126\u25e6h. Not only has the apparent trend in\nfc,cluster with temperature now virtually disappeared,\nbut the scatter has been reduced considerably. In this\ncase the fc,cluster values are in much closer agreement\nwith fc,global; the remaining difference is not very com-\npelling, since a slightly lower \u2126\u25e6 \u2248 0.2 would result in\nconcordance between the cluster and global fractions.\nThese results differ from those of Bryan (2000),\nwho claims that fc,cluster increases from cluster to group\nscales. However, this trend could well be the result of\na bias due to the limited radial extent of the X-ray\nobservations, Rx, in the group samples (Roussel et al.\n2000). For example, from the Mulchaey et al. (1996)\nsample considered by Bryan (2000), the groups with\nthe smallest Rx have among the highest fc,cluster values.\nOn the other hand, the two groups for which Rx > 0.5\nMpc have the lowest fc,cluster. This emphasizes the im-\nportance of ensuring the X-ray data extend out to at\nleast a sizable fraction of the virial radius, as we have\ndone when considering the Roussel et al. compilation.\nWe have shown that there is no discernable trend of\nfc,cluster with temperature in this sample, particularly\nif the baryon fraction is assumed from nucleosynthesis\narguments, rather than relying on the measurement of\nMhot.\n3 NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\nHydrodynamical numerical simulations which attempt\nto follow the effects of gas cooling have proved very diffi-\ncult to perform across the full range of the gravitational\nmass hierarchy. Allowing gas to dissipate its energy via\nradiative cooling generates enormous density contrasts\nand a huge range of interesting spatial scales within the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 Balogh et al.\nFigure 1.

The\ncluster data are all normalized to a stellar M\/LB = 4.5; increas-\ning this number increases fc,cluster proportionally. The horizontal\nline shows the best estimate of the global cold baryon fraction,\nfc,global, based on the K\u2212band luminosity function results of\nCole et al. (2000); note that fc,global\u221d h. Bottom panel: fc,cluster\nis computed from Equation 1, where the total baryon mass is\nthe sum of observed galaxies and hot gas. The data points scale\napproximately like fc,cluster \u221d h\n0.5. Top panel:fc,cluster is com-\nputed from Equation 2, which does not depend on a measurement\nof Mhot, but is dependent on \u2126\u25e6. In this case, fc,cluster \u221d \u2126\u25e6h.\nmodel, even before the intrinsically sub-resolution pro-\ncesses of star formation and the feedback of energy due\nto supernovae and stellar winds are considered.\nThe earliest attempt at such a simulation was made\nby Thomas & Couchman (1992), though the model\nwhich included radiative cooling was only briefly dis-\ncussed. This model had a very high mass resolution\nthreshold, allowing only the largest galaxies to form,\nand only a small fraction of the gas to cool. This was\nquickly followed by the work of Katz & White (1993)\nwho produced a model that was several years ahead of\nits time. They demonstrated that the formation of a\nVirgo-like cluster, including the effects of cooling, could\nbe followed by a computer simulation. However, the\nmodel had some problems: in particular, as the authors\nmake clear, much more gas cools than is observed. These\nresults are shown as the large, filled circles in Figure\n2. The lower point shows the actual fraction of cold\nbaryons in the simulation; the higher point to which it\nis connected shows this fraction corrected by extrapo-\nlating the simulated luminosity function to include the\nadditional cooled gas within unresolved objects, as de-\nscribed in Katz & White. The simulation of Katz &\nWhite was stopped at z = 0.13, so the redshift zero\nfraction will be even higher.\nPearce et al. (2000) \nKatz & White(1993)\nLewis et al. (2000)\nFigure 2. The solid points are the cooled baryon fractions in\nseveral standard CDM simulations, as labelled. The lower point\nrefers to the measured cooled fraction, and the upper point to\nwhich it is joined is corrected to include the contribution of unre-\nsolved galaxies. All of these simulations use h = 0.5, and cannot\nbe rescaled for other values of h. The Dave\u00b4 et al. (2000) work\nconsiders both treecode and Eularian grid-based simulations in\nseveral cosmologies; we represent the average cooled fraction of\nthese simulations as a lower limit, because it does not include\ncooled gas in unresolved galaxies. The data are shown as open\nsymbols, and are the same as those in the bottom panel of Figure\n1, but for h = 0.5 instead of h = 0.7.\nRecently there has been renewed interest in this\nproblem. Suginohara & Ostriker (1998) also produced a\ncluster model, and noted that additional physical pro-\ncesses (such as star formation and feedback) would be\nrequired to prevent the cooling of an excessively large\nfraction of the gas; unfortunately, the fraction of cooled\nbaryons was not published in their paper so we can-\nnot consider their results in Figure 2. Their work was\nfollowed by that of Pearce et al. (1999; 2000), Lewis et\nal. (2000) and Dave\u00b4 et al. (2000). Lewis et al. used a\nmore advanced code to improve upon the earlier sim-\nulation of Katz & White (1993), and they also found\nthat around 40% of the gas within the cluster cools.\nThis is shown in Figure 2 as filled triangles; the up-\nper triangle includes a correction for galaxies below the\nresolution limit, by extrapolating the resultant lumi-\nnosity function assuming a faint end slope \u03b1 = \u22120.96.\nDave\u00b4 et al. used both a parallel treecode and a Eulerian\ngrid based code in several cosmologies and, although the\ncluster-by-cluster fractions are not quoted, find a uni-\nversal cooling fraction of around 30% to 40% for their\nhigh resolution simulations, in both cases. This is shown\nas a lower limit in Figure 2, since it does not include a\ncorrection for galaxies formed in haloes below the reso-\nlution limit.\nSimulations like those discussed above which cool\ntoo much gas cannot be expected to model galaxy\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n5formation in a physically correct way. An alternative,\nheuristic approach can be taken to force the simulations\nto satisfy the constraint on fc,global, by limiting the res-\nolution (see \u00a7 3.1). This is the method used by Pearce\net al. (2000), who deliberately set their mass resolution\nto cool \u223c15% of the gas within their simulation volume;\nthe cooled fractions for the twenty most massive of these\nclusters are shown in Figure 2 as the filled squares (both\nbefore and after correction for sub-resolution galaxies).\nBy construction, the cooled gas fractions of these sim-\nulated haloes are closer to the observed values, though\nthey are still probably too high. The obvious problem\nwith this simulation is that it does not allow the forma-\ntion of small galaxies.\n3.1 Resolution\nIt has long been theorised that progessively increas-\ning the resolution within a simulation leads to a con-\ntinual increase in the fraction of material which cools\n(Cole 1991;White & Frenk 1991; Suginohara & Ostriker\n1998), a situation commonly referred to as the cooling\ncatastrophe. We demonstrate this in Figure 3, by pre-\nsenting the results of standard cold dark matter simula-\ntions, at different resolutions (the mass of the smallest\nobject that can effectively cool). This figure shows how\nthe fraction of gas particles in the cold phase increases\nas resolution is increased. At the low resolution end, the\nrelation is too steep, due to the artificial heating prob-\nlems described by Steinmetz & White (1997). However,\nthe trends discussed below are qualitatively retained,\neven when this problem is overcome (Kay 2000). Apart\nfrom this effect, the shape of the curve will be approx-\nimately independent of the simulations. However, the\nscale along the abscissa will vary; that is, the curves\nmay be translated laterally, for example, by changing\n\u2126b. More subtly, in a model with a positive cosmological\nconstant, structure forms earlier and so more gas cools\nat the same threshold mass. This causes the curves plot-\nted on Figure 3 to move to the right by about a factor of\ntwo. Changes in metallicity can affect the result in the\nsame way, though even primoridal abundances cannot\nprevent the cooling catastrophe (Dave\u00b4 et al. 2000). In\naddition, differences in the numerical implementation\ncan also shift the curve by factors of order two.\nFigure 3 makes it clear why some groups find cooled\ngas fractions around 40% whilst others find much lower\nfractions. Values around 40% will be achieved for a wide\nrange of simulation resolutions, as this is the value ob-\ntained when the resolution mass is less than the char-\nacteristic mass of the halo mass function. More gas will\ncool as the resolution is increased but a large increase\nis required to see a significant change, since the slope of\nthe mass function is shallow in this regime. Any re-\nquired cold gas fraction below 40% can be obtained\nby choosing the resolution appropriately, although care\nmust be taken to account for artificial heating (Stein-\nmetz & White 1997). However, in order to get a good\nmatch to the observed gas fraction within a standard\ncold dark matter simulation the resolution limit must\nbe set to \u223c 1011M\u2299 or higher, which is clearly unphys-\nically high. This is the situation we referred to as the\nFigure 3. Fraction of baryons in three phases (representing\nshocked gas, cooled gas [galaxies] and unshocked, diffuse baryons)\nagainst the baryonic mass of the smallest resolvable galaxy for\nstandard CDM simulations with radiative cooling. The simula-\ntions use a box\u2013size of 10h\u22121 Mpc and \u2126b = 0.06. The two points\nwith the largest mass threshold are too low, due to artificial heat-\ning effects. Further details are contained in Kay (2000).\n\u201ccooling crisis\u201d; it is a crisis because its resolution will\nresult in a significant improvement in the utility of sim-\nulation results.\n4 DISCUSSION\nWe have demonstrated that it is easy to exceed the ob-\nserved cooled gas fraction with numerical simulations\nof sufficient resolution. The failure to match this con-\nstraint reflects the well-known need for some method\nof reheating the gas in order to prevent excessive star\nformation at high redshift (Larson 1974; White & Rees\n1978; White & Frenk 1991). Until an effective feedback\nmodel is implemented in simulations, it will not be pos-\nsible to obtain physically illuminating results.\nPresent attempts to incorporate feedback within\ncosmological simulations all suffer from the same draw-\nback, that the physical processes responsible for the re-\ndistribution of energy occur on scales well below those\nthat can presently be resolved. Hence, an accurate treat-\nment of the propagation of energy from the local ISM\nto super-galactic scales is currently an intractable prob-\nlem. However, several groups have attempted to include\nfeedback by injecting the energy into regions at the reso-\nlution limit of the simulation. For example, an approach\nthat has been taken in smoothed particle hydrodynam-\nics (SPH) simulations is simply to add available energy\nfrom newly-formed \u201dstar\u201d particles to the thermal en-\nergy of the surrounding gas (Katz et al. 1996; Lewis\net al. 2000; Dave\u00b4 et al. 2000). However, the majority\nof this gas is cold and dense, and so any excess energy\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 Balogh et al.\nis rapidly re-radiated. It is plausible that this problem\nis due to the failure of the SPH simulations to resolve\na multiphase medium, in which the feedback would be\nable to create hot bubbles of diffuse gas, with signif-\nicantly longer cooling times than the cold dense gas\nfrom which they were spawned. Several groups have at-\ntempted to \u201dcorrect\u201d for this by preventing reheated\ngas from radiatively cooling over a finite timescale (e.g.\nGerritsen 1997; Springel 2000; Thacker & Couchman\n2000). Another method is to supply energy in kinetic\nform (e.g. Navarro & White 1993; Kay 2000), which is\nefficient at limiting the fraction of cooled gas. However,\nthe effectiveness of this implementation may be arti-\nficial since the SPH simulations fail to resolve shocks\nthat would efficiently thermalize the reheated material\n(Katz et al. 1996).\nAn alternative approach to feedback is that of Cen\n& Ostriker (1999), who use a grid-based cosmological\ncode, and implement analytic rules, similar to those\nof semi-analytic models (Somerville & Primack 1999;\nCole et al. 2000a; Kauffmann et al. 1999; Somerville\net al. 2001) to regulate the formation of galaxies within\na single cell. Unfortunately, the resolution of grid-based\nmethods such as this is still too coarse (\u223c 100h\u22121 kpc\nin the highest resolution simulation of Cen & Ostriker)\nto provide useful results on galaxy scales. It is not clear\nthat the analytic rules implemented to model the sub-\ngrid physics in this code are robust to changes in res-\nolution, as changes in the cell size can result in large\nchanges in the gas densities, for which the analytic\nformalism may not appropriately compensate. A more\npromising route may be the use of adaptive-mesh re-\nfinement codes (Bryan & Norman 1998; Bryan & Voit\n2001), which will allow the implementation of an ana-\nlytic treatment of gas cooling within cells of sufficient\nresolution.\nThe goal now is to find a physically motivated feed-\nback model which is able to sufficiently reduce fc. It is\ntherefore useful to consider, qualitatively, what is re-\nquired of such a model. The amount of gas which can\ncool in a given halo cannot be computed by consider-\ning a halo structure at a single redshift and treating\nit as if it had existed unchanged over a Hubble time.\nFor example, the cooling time in clusters today is much\nlonger than the Hubble time, and this has been used\nto explain why not all of the gas in these environments\nhas cooled (Binney 1977; Silk 1977; Rees & Ostriker\n1977). However, this argument does not hold in hi-\nerarchical models, where cluster progenitors at earlier\nepochs were low mass haloes in which the cooling time\nwas short, and simulations of hierarchical cluster for-\nmation demonstrate that a large fraction of the baryons\ncool by the present day. To treat the problem analyti-\ncally, it is necessary to consider the hierarchical growth\nof a halo through the plane of Figure 4. The smooth\ncurved lines represent the evolution of structure, for a\nstandard CDM model (\u03c38 = 0.8, \u0393 = \u2126\u25e6h = 0.5); the\ncentral line shows the median mass halo which virial-\nizes as a function of redshift, and the two others bracket\nthe region in which 50% of the mass in the Universe col-\nlapses into haloes. In a manner similar to that of Rees &\nOstriker (1977), we can define an efficient cooling mass,\nMcool, as the mass which can cool all the gas out to its\nvirial radius, within a Hubble time at redshift z. The\ncooling rate, which depends on halo density and tem-\nperature, is computed using the models of Raymond et\nal. (1976), with one-third solar metallicity. This cooling\nmass, for the standard CDM model described above, is\nshown in Figure 4, and is given by Mcool \u223c 10\n12M\u2299,\nalmost completely independent of redshift for z < 10.\nThis non-trivial result is a consequence of the fact that,\nwhen cooling is dominated by line emission, the increase\nin the cooling rate with increasing redshift is closely bal-\nanced by the decrease in the Hubble time. This forms\nan approximate upper mass limit to efficient cooling;\nhaloes with masses smaller than this limit can cool all\nof their gas, out to the virial radius, while to the right\nof this line, only a rapidly decreasing fraction of the gas\nis able to cool.\nAt low redshifts, most of the haloes which are col-\nlapsing are more massive than Mcool; therefore, cooling\nplays a minor role today. By z \u2248 1, however, the char-\nacteristic mass crosses the Mcool threshold, and cool-\ning becomes a dominant process, leading to the cool-\ning catastrophe. In simulations, the resolution thresh-\nold imposes a mass limit, Mth, which prevents smaller\nmass haloes from cooling. Efficient cooling is therefore\nrestricted to the shaded region in Figure 4. As Mth is\nlowered, more and more mass cools, and will quickly ex-\nceed the tight observational constraints. If the threshold\nis high enough to prevent efficient cooling at high red-\nshift, no low mass galaxies are formed.\nThe final fraction of cooled gas then depends on the\ntrajectory a particular halo takes through this plane, as\nit grows. This growth will occur via both smooth accre-\ntion, and discrete jumps due to mergers. The resolution\nthreshold imprints a scale on the accumulation of cooled\nbaryons, as the final fraction fc in a given halo will de-\npend on its trajectory only after it becomes sufficiently\nresolved. This could have an effect on the dependence\nof fc on halo mass in simulations (but see Kay 2000).\nIt is clear that any analytic feedback model which\nbehaves in a manner similar to a sharp, fixed mass\nthreshold will fail to simultaneously match the observed\nfc,global and still produce a reasonable galaxy luminos-\nity function. A physical feedback scheme, however, does\nnot provide a hard mass threshold, but gradually alters\nthe cooling efficiency of haloes as a function of mass\nand redshift; thus the shaded region in Figure 4 be-\ncomes a \u201cfuzzy\u201d region without a well defined lower\nboundary. There are many models for such feedback,\nincluding supernovae or AGN reheating (Larson 1974;\nWhite & Rees 1978; Lacey & Silk 1991; Cole 1991; Wu\net al. 1998; Bower et al. 2000; Mac Low & Ferrara\n1999; Efstathiou 2000), ionizing radiation from the ul-\ntraviolet background (Efstathiou 1992; Weinberg et al.\n1997), and an entropy threshold established at high red-\nshift (Kaiser 1991; Blanchard et al. 1992; Ponman et al.\n1999; Balogh et al. 1999). A very successful implemen-\ntation of a feedback scaling law is that used by semi-\nanalytic models of galaxy formation (Cole et al. 2000a;\nSomerville & Primack 1999; Kauffmann et al. 1999;\nSomerville et al. 2001), in which the mass of reheated\ngas is assumed to scale in proportion with the halo cir-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n78 10 12 14\n1\n5\nFigure 4. The region of efficient gas cooling in the Universe, as\na function of halo mass and redshift. The smooth curved lines\ndelineate the formation of structure in the Universe. The central\nline represents the median halo mass which virialises at the cor-\nresponding redshift; 50% of the mass in the Universe collapses\nbetween the two lines which bracket this one. Mcool is the mass\nthreshold below which haloes can cool out to their virial radius.\nMth is the mass threshold within the numerical model, generally\ngiven by the resolution, below which cooling cannot occur. The\nshaded region therefore denotes the region within which cooling\nis important.\ncular velocity raised to some power \u03b1. Though this scal-\ning is constructed to allow the models to match the ob-\nserved luminosity function, it also succeeds in limiting\nfc to more reasonable values (though generally still high\ncompared with the constraints described here). Further-\nmore, there may be some theoretical motivation for this\nscaling relation from supernova-driven wind models (Ef-\nstathiou 2000). The next step in this work is to combine\nthese models with realistic halo merger trees to deter-\nmine, analytically, how they affect the cooling rate as a\nfunction of halo mass and redshift, for implementation\ninto numerical simulations.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we have presented an up-to-date review\nof the cooling catastrophe. Although the issues we have\ndiscussed have been known for a long time, recent ad-\nvances in observations and simulation techniques war-\nrant a reevaluation of the situation, which can be sum-\nmarized in two key points:\n\u2022 The global fraction of baryons in the form of stars\nand cold gas is now well constrained observationally\nfrom the K\u2212band luminosity function to be fc,global\u2248\n0.073h. Although there is some uncertainty about how\nthis may vary with halo mass, there is no convincing ev-\nidence for a significant difference from the global value.\n\u2022 The amount of gas which cools in simulations is\ndirectly related to the resolution, unless a working re-\nheating scheme is implemented. No current simulation\nis able to produce both (1) the correct fc,global and (2) a\npopulation of low mass galaxies, without implementing\nanalytic models of the sub-grid physics on uncomfort-\nably large scales.\nThe use of simulations to aid our understanding\nof galaxy properties and of cluster scaling laws there-\nfore awaits the implementation of a sub-grid, physi-\ncal feedback scheme which allows the models to sat-\nisfy observational constraints on fc,global in a resolution-\nindependent way.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nMLB acknowledges support from a PPARC rolling\ngrant for extragalactic astronomy and cosmology at\nDurham.
