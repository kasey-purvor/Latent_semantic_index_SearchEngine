Treatment options are limited and \nthere is a large unmet clinical need for additional therapies. TNF-\u03b1 is a \nproinflammatory cytokine, which has been implicated in many aspects of the airway \npathology in asthma and has recently been highlighted as potentially important in \nrefractory asthma. The development of neutralising biological agents against TNF-\u03b1 \nhas allowed the testing of its role in vivo. Preliminary studies have demonstrated an \nimprovement in lung function, airway hyperresponsiveness, asthma quality of life and \na reduction in exacerbation frequency in patients treated following anti-TNF-\u03b1 \ntherapy. We have reviewed the evidence associating TNF-\u03b1 with asthma airway \nbiology and summarise the findings of currently published clinical trials of anti-TNF-\n\u03b1 therapy in asthma. \n \n 3\n1.0 Biological Activities of TNF\u03b1 in relation to asthma \nTNF-\u03b1 is an important cytokine in the innate immune response which provides \nimmediate host defence against invading organisms prior to activation of the adaptive \nimmune system1. It is principally produced by macrophages in response to activation \nof membrane bound pattern recognition molecules, which detect common bacterial \ncell surface products such as polysaccharide, carbohydrates and lipopolysaccarides. It \nis initially produced as a biologically active 26kD membrane anchored precursor \nprotein2 which is subsequently cleaved, principally by TNF- \u03b1 converting enzyme \n(TACE)3, to release the 17kD free protein. These proteins form into biologically \nactive homotrimers4 which act on the ubiquitously expressed TNF- \u03b1 receptors 1 and \n2 (p55 and p75 or TNFRi and TNFRii)5. The receptor-ligand interaction causes \nintracellular signalling without internalisation of the complex, which leads to \nphosphorylation of NF-\u03baB to activate the p50-p65 subunit, which interacts with the \nDNA chromatin structure to increase transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, such as \nIL-8, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 itself. Response to TNF- \u03b1 activation is balanced by shedding \nof the extracellular domain of the TNF- \u03b1  receptors. \n \nDysregulated TNF-\u03b1 response has been implicated in a number of inflammatory \nconditions. In rheumatoid arthritis, a common destructive arthropathy in which TNF-\n \u03b1 is produced by macrophages and monocytes in response to activation by CD4+ T \ncells, TNF- \u03b1  is measurable in increased concentration in the synovial fluid and in \nthe serum6. Antagonism of TNF- \u03b1 either by treatment with recombinant soluble \nreceptors or neutralising antibodies in patients with rheumatoid disease leads to \nimprovement in disease activity scores7. Similarly positive results are seen in \n 4\ntreatment of other conditions that are thought to be mediated by TNF- \u03b1, including \nCrohn\u2019s disease and Be\u00e7het\u2019s disease. \n \nThe possibility that TNF- \u03b1 contributes to the dysregulated inflammatory response \nseen in the asthmatic airway is raised by the findings of increased TNF- \u03b1 mRNA8 \nand protein9 in the airway of patients with asthma. Moreover, the administration of \ninhaled recombinant TNF- \u03b1 to normal subjects led to the development of airway \nhyperresponsiveness and an airway neutrophilia10. The administration of TNF- \u03b1 to \npatients with asthma leads to an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness as measured \nby a reduction in methacholine PC2011. The mechanism behind these observations has \nnot been fully elucidated: it could represent a direct effect of TNF- \u03b1 on airway \nsmooth muscle12 or be mediated by the release of the cysteinyl-leukotrienes LTC4 and \nLTD413. The release of mediators from mast cells localised to the airway smooth \nmuscle has recently been suggested to be important in the pathogenesis of airway \nhyperresponsiveness and bronchoconstriction in asthma14. TNF- \u03b1 induces histamine \nrelease from human mast cells directly15 and participates in a positive autocrine loop \nthat potentiates human mast cell cytokine secretion16. It is possible therefore that \nTNF- \u03b1 is involved in mast cell\/smooth muscle interaction and that this is particularly \nimportant in the development of airway hyper-responsiveness. \n \nTNF- \u03b1 has a number of other actions which may be relevant to asthma: it is \nchemoattractant for neutrophils and eosinophils17 it increases the cytotoxic effect of \neosinophils on endothelial cells18, it is involved in activation and cytokine release by \nT-Cells19 and it increases epithelial expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-\n 5\n1 and V-CAM-120 which play an important role is the conduction of T-Cells to the \nlung and in the subsequent development of airway hyper-responsiveness21. \n \nIn addition to its relevance to asthma in general, TNF- \u03b1 has a number of properties \nthat might be relevant to refractory asthma, including: recruitment of neutrophils10, \ninduction of glucocorticoid resistance22, myocyte proliferation23 and stimulation of \nfibroblast growth and maturation to myofibroblasts by promoting TGF- \u03b1 \nexpression24,25. \n \n2.0 Clinical Trials of Anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy. (Summarised in Table 1) \nThe current commercially available TNF-\u03b1 blockers are infliximab which is a \nchimeric mouse\/human monoclonal antibody, etanercept which is a soluble fusion \nprotein combining two p75 TNF receptors with a Fc fragment of human IgG1 and \nadalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody.  \n \nIn an uncontrolled study of etanercept in severe (GINA stage V) asthma Howarth and \ncolleagues demonstrated a significant 2.5 doubling concentration improvement in \nmethacholine airway hyperresponsiveness, a 240ml improvement in FEV1 and an \nimprovement in asthma quality of life26.  These findings were repeated in a \nrandomised, placebo controlled study in which 12 weeks treatment with etanercept \nlead to a similar improvement in PC20 and FEV1 as well as an improvement in asthma \nrelated quality of life27. One of the striking aspects of this study was that the clinical \nresponse correlated closely with the expression of TNF\u03b1 and TNFalphaR1 on \nmonocytes. Increased expression of TNF\u03b1 was only noted in patients with severe \ndisease. This suggests that TNF\u03b1 may only be involved in a subset of severe \n 6\nasthmatics and that measurement of monocyte expression of TNF\u03b1  may be a useful \nbiomarker of responsiveness.  Another interesting aspect of the study was that there \nwas no effect on the number of sputum eosinophils or neutrophils suggesting that \nTNF\u03b1 antagonism was working through the airway smooth muscle axis rather than an \ninflammatory pathway.  Erin and colleagues performed a randomised, placebo \ncontrolled study with infliximab in patients with moderately severe asthma in which \nthey did not find any significant improvement in lung function but noted a 50% \nreduction in the number of exacerbations encountered28. It is possible that the lack of \neffect on lung function was due to the selection of patients with less severe disease or \nthat there is a therapeutic difference between etanercept and infliximab. \n \nHowever we are aware of two unpublished studies of etanercept (the  preliminary data \nfrom one of these has been published in abstract form (29) which were larger than \nthose quoted above which demonstrated no beneficial effect. This could be due to \ndifferent degrees of severity but it does suggest that if anti-TNF\u03b1 is effective in \nasthma it will only be on a relatively small sub-group of patients, possibly defined by \nan increased TNF\u03b1 axis.  \n \nAnother concern is the safety of TNF-\u03b130.  A recent report of the use of Infliximab in \nCOPD for six months apart from showing no benefit, recorded 9 malignancies out of \n157 treated patients as oppose to one in 77 placebo treated subjects together with an \nincreased risk of pneumonia 31. There has also been an excess of malignancy and \ninfection reported in patients treated with anti-TNF-\u03b1 for rheumatoid arthritis. \n \n 7\nIn summary therefore TNF-\u03b1 is a potentially important cytokine in refractory asthma \nand preliminary studies on small numbers of patients have demonstrated an \nimprovement in lung function, airway hyperresponsiveness, asthma quality of life and \nexacerbation rate with anti-TNF therapy. These findings have, however, not been \nconsistently repeatable and any potential role for TNF-\u03b1 antagonism in refractory \nasthma needs to be established in a sufficiently powered large scale clinical trial. \nThere also needs to be a focus on  drug safety, particularly in respect of susceptibility \nto severe infection and the development of solid organ malignancy. Heterogeneity in \nresponse to TNF-\u03b1 antagonism could lie in the genetics of TNF-\u03b1 as polymorphisms \nin the cytokine gene, particularly in the G to A transition at position 308  and have \nbeen associated with increased risk of asthma in some studies 32 This aspect also \nneeds to be addressed in future studies of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy. Clearly any further \nstudies of anti-TNF\u03b1 need to focus on identifying a treatment responsive subset of \npatients.  \n \n 8\nReference list \n \n1. Medzhitov R, Janeway C, Jr. Innate immunity.
