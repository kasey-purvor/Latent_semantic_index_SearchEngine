Introduction\nAeroelasticity is the field of study that deals with the interaction of structural, inertia, and aerodynamic force.\nClassical theories assume linear aerodynamics and structures, and the aeroelastic problem reduces to the\nsolution of a set of linear equations that can be easily solved. However, when the airspeed increases to high\nsubsonic or transonic Mach numbers, linear aerodynamics usually give insufficiently accurate results, an\nexample of which is the transonic dip that linear aerodynamics fail to detect. Also, flow separation and shock\noscillations can introduce phenomena, which classical aeroelasticity is unable to handle. Nonlinear aerodynamic\neffects are more difficult to analyze since the fluid motion is governed by equations where analytical solutions\nare practically non-existent [1, 2]. A full non-linear aerodynamic code solving the Euler equations has been\nsuccessfully coupled to a structural model for a two-dimensional flow case by Djayapertapa and Allen et al [3-6].\nA control law was implemented within this aeroelastic solver to investigate active means of flutter suppression\nvia control surface motion. Comparisons of open- and closed-loop calculations show that the control law could\nsuccessfully suppress the flutter and results in a significant increase in the allowable speed index in transonic\nregime. But full CFD-CSD coupled codes are currently too time consuming to be used in the design loop, and\nparticularly so if control law design is to be considered. Further, the lack of visibility of the full-non-linear\nequations in state space form makes various procedures, such as various forms of control law design, and\nstability analysis, extremely difficult, if not impossible. This has resulted in the creation of a reduced order\nmodel (ROM) of the Euler code [7]. The ROM has the accuracy similar to CFD method, but a time scale of\noperation much more comparable with that of traditional linear methods. And a comparison of full non-linear\nand reduced order aerodynamic models in control law design was made in Ref. [7].\nOn the other hand, structural nonlinearities arise from worn hinges of control surfaces, loose control\nlinkages, material behavior and various other sources. Aging aircraft and combat aircraft that carry heavy\nexternal stores are more likely to be influenced by effects associated with nonlinear structures. With structural\nnonlinearities, aeroelastic system may exhibit a variety of phenomena such as limit cycle oscillation and chaotic\nvibration [8]. An extensive review of the analysis of structural nonlinearities for airfoil section may be found in\nRef. [1].\nIn the past few years at Duke University, Dowell and colleagues have constructed a typical airfoil section\naeroelastic experimental model with control surface freeplay. They have also designed and installed an\nexperimental rotating slotted cylinder (RSC) gust generator in the Duke University low-speed wind tunnel,\nwhich was used to create a periodic or a linear frequency sweep gust excitation field [9]. Using these\nexperimental facilities, a series of theoretical and experimental studies, such as flutter and LCOs [10], gust\n3responses and alleviation [11], and flutter\/LCO control [12, 13] have been completed. An experimental\nhigh-aspect ratio wing aeroelastic model with a device to provide a controllable slender body tip mass\ndistribution for flutter suppression has been constructed by Tang and Dowell [14]. This study also shows the\neffects of the geometric structural nonlinearity as modeled by nonlinear beam theory and nonlinear aerodynamic\nstall theory on both the flutter instability boundary and the nonlinear limit cycle oscillation response.\nFor the two-dimensional wing section with structural stiffness nonlinearity, research effort has being made to\ndevelop control strategies to suppress flutter. In Ref. [15] for example, a classical linear full-state feedback\ncontrol law was derived for a wing section with nonlinear stiffness to stabilize the nonlinear system in some\ncircumstances. In Ref. [16], a partial feedback linearization methodology was applied to the design of nonlinear\ncontrollers for a nonlinear aeroelastic system. In order to derive a globally stabilizing controller, a full feedback\nlinearization controller based on two control surfaces was designed. The stability of the closed-loop aeroelastic\nsystem was further investigated in Ref. [17]. The state-dependent Riccati equation method was developed for\nnonlinear control problems, and used to design suboptimal control laws of nonlinear aeroelastic systems\nconsidering both quasi-steady [18, 19] and unsteady aerodynamics [20, 21]. A global robust control law for an\naeroelastic model of uncertainty was derived considering output feedback in Ref. [22].\nThe impact of uncertainty on aeroelastic response prediction has received substantial attention in the\nresearch literature. General sources of uncertainty that complicate airframe design and testing were briefly\ndescribed by Pettit [23]. Pettit and Beran [24] investigated the effects of uncertainty on airfoil LCO by using of\nMonte Carlo simulation (MCS). Parametric uncertainty was modeled in the third- and fifth-order stiffness\ncoefficients of the pitch spring. Different computational methodologies, such as Wiener\u2013Haar, Cyclic and\nB-spline projection methods have been developed to quantify the uncertain response of an airfoil aeroelastic\nsystem in limit-cycle oscillation, subject to parametric variability [25]. Uncertainties are specified in the cubic\ncoefficient of the torsional spring and in the initial pitch angle of the airfoil. When the uncertainty was\nconsidered in the flutter suppression, adaptive controllers based on partial or full feedback linearization were\nderived [26]. In Ref. [27], experimental results were presented to exam the adaptive controller derived by Ref.\n[26]. A series of adaptive controllers were derived for flutter suppression by Singh et al [28, 29], and\nunstructured uncertainties were also taken into account [30]. In order to improve the performance of the\nadaptive controller, both leading-edge (LE) and trailing-edge (TE) control surfaces were used in the design of\nmultiple-input multiple-output control strategies in Ref. [31-33]. Recently, an output feedback control law has\nbeen implemented for suppressing flutter and reducing the vibrational level in sub-critical flight speed range\n[34]. An adaptive decoupled fuzzy sliding-mode controller has been presented in Ref. [35]. Based on the\ntensor-product model transformation and the parallel distributed compensation, a control law for prototypical\naeroelastic wing section was designed and presented in Ref. [36].\nIn the previous references, only parametric uncertainty in pitch stiffness has been considered. In fact, the\ndamping uncertainty in airframe structure and control system is inevitable and may have significant effect on the\naeroelastic behavior [37]. However, it is very difficult to establish an accurate damping model, and the much of\nexperimental data is normally needed. Therefore this current investigation has been focused on deriving an\nadaptive controller for flutter suppression of a nonlinear aeroelastic system damping uncertainty. Two examples\nof adaptive controller have been taken, and the numerical simulation results have been compared with that\nwithout damping uncertainty.\n2. Nonlinear Aeroelastic Model\nA generic two-dimensional wing section with leading-edge (LE) and trailing-edge (TE) control surfaces as\nillustrated in Fig. 1 has been considered in classical aeroelastic analysis. The elastic axis (e.a) of the model is\n4located at a distance ab from the mid-chord, while the mass center (m.c) is located at a distance x\uf061b from the e.a.\nThe parameters a and x\uf061 are positive in Fig. 1 where e.a is after the mid-chord and m.c is after e.a. measured\nfrom LE. The plunge deflection h is positive downward, and the pitch angle \uf061 about the e.a is positive nose-up.\nThe TE and LE control surface rotation angles \uf062 and \uf067 are positive downward.\nThe governing equation of motion of the aeroelastic model are given by [27]\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n0 0\n0 0\nh hT W\nW\nc km m x b h Lh h\nc km x b I M\n\uf061\n\uf061 \uf061\uf061 \uf061 \uf061 \uf061 \uf061\uf061 \uf061\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9 \uf0e9 \uf0f9 \uf02d\uf0e9 \uf0f9 \uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf0e9 \uf0f9 \uf0e9 \uf0f9 \uf0e9 \uf0f9\n\uf02b \uf02b \uf03d\uf0ea \uf0fa \uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ea \uf0fa \uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ea \uf0fa \uf0ea \uf0fa \uf0ea \uf0fa\n\uf0eb \uf0fb \uf0eb \uf0fb\uf0eb \uf0fb \uf0eb \uf0fb \uf0eb \uf0fb\uf0eb \uf0fb \uf0eb \uf0fb\n\uf026\uf026 \uf026\n\uf026\uf026\uf026 \uf026\n(1)\nwhere \uf028 \uf029k\uf061 \uf061 and \uf028 \uf029c\uf061 \uf061\uf026 represent the nonlinear pitch stiffness and damping of the system, and are\nexpressed in polynomial form as follows\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\n1\n1\n1\n1\nm\ni\ni\ni\nn\ni\ni\ni\nc c\nk k\n\uf061\n\uf061\n\uf061 \uf061\n\uf061 \uf061\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5\n\uf026 \uf026\n(2)\nIn the latter adaptive controller design, parametric uncertainties are considered in both pitch damping and\nstiffness. ci and ki are assumed to be unknown.

Adaptive Control of Feedback Linearization\nBoth partial and full feedback linearization methods have been used for the nonlinear aeroelastic control in a\nseries of references [38].

Example Results and Discussion\nIn this section, numerical examples would be given to verify the control laws derived in section 3 and 4. For\neach example, open-loop flutter characters were first present to help the aeroelastic system being considered to\nbe understood.\n5.1 Example 1\nFor the wing section with single TE control surface, the model and parameters used in Ref. [27] were chosen\n9in this case study and listed in table 1. The coefficients of nonlinear pitch stiffness used in the simulation are {ki}\n= [6.833 9.967 667.685 26.569 -5087.931]. This nonlinear stiffness relationship was approximated based on\nexperimental measured data in Ref. [27], and was shown in Fig. 2. The pitch damping coefficient c\uf061 = 0.036.\nThe response of the open-loop aeroelastic system is dependent on the flow velocity and initial conditions.\nGiven a set of initial conditions, the response is convergent when the flow velocity is smaller than a critical\nvalue (flutter speed). And LCO will occur when the flow velocity is higher than flutter speed. With the initial\nconditions h (0) = 0.01 m, \uf061(0) = 0.1 rad, and \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0290 0 0h \uf061\uf03d \uf03d\uf026 \uf026 , Fig. 3 shows the plunge and pitch responses\nfor the flow velocity U = 7.91 m\/s and U = 7.92 m\/s separately. The responses are totally different, which means\nthat the flutter speed is 7.92 m\/s for the special initial conditions. In order to investigate the effect of initial\nconditions on flutter speed, flutter boundaries on initial pitch angle were obtained. With initial plunge and pitch\nvelocities \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0290 0 0h \uf061\uf03d \uf03d\uf026 \uf026 , Fig. 4 gives three flutter boundaries for three different initial plunge\ndisplacements. We find that flutter boundary is symmetric about \uf061(0) = 0 axis when h (0) = 0. And the\nincreasing of h (0) reduces the effect of \uf061(0) on flutter speed. The flutter speed decrease from 11.6 m\/s to 7.9\nm\/s with \uf061(0) increasing from 0 to \u00b1 0.2 rad. When h (0) = 0.01, the maximum flutter speed becomes 10.5 m\/s.\nAnd it continues decrease to 8.9 m\/s when h (0) = 0.05.\nNow the feedback linearization adaptive control law Eq. (11) and parameter estimate update law Eq. (17)\nwere considered to suppress the LCOs described above. The initial conditions were chosen as h(0) = 0.01m,\n\uf061\uf020(0) =0.1 rad, \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0290 0 0h \uf061\uf03d \uf03d\uf026 \uf026 . It is noted in this case that the pitch damping is still linear, which is the\nsame with Ref. [27]. In the nonlinear adaptive controller design however, it was modeled as a third-order\npolynomial, and so {ci} = [0.036 0 0]. The eight initial estimations of both stiffness and damping uncertainty\nparameters were set to zero. In order to show the effect of damping uncertainty on the closed-loop responses, the\nsimulations of adaptive control with and without damping uncertainty were carried out in the same time.\nFigure 5 shows the time histories of the closed-loop system in plunge, pitch, and control surface deflection\nfor free stream velocity U=16 m\/s. We find that the aerodynamic system is stable in both the two cases, which\nindicates that the adaptive control law is effective to control the LCOs. Furthermore, it is obvious that when the\ndamping uncertainty was taken into account, the system responses were suppressed to converge in less period of\ntime. As the adaptive control law is designed based the output of pitch angle, considering the damping\nuncertainty dramatically reduces the convergence time of pitching response from about 3s to less than 0.5s. For\nthe plunge response, the peak values with damping uncertainty are smaller than the ones without uncertainty. In\nthis case however, it is noted that the required maximum TE control deflection is about 0.65 rad (37 deg) as\nshown in Fig. 5c, which is impractical to implement. So another case was performed with the control surface\ndeflection was limited to \u00b115 deg, while the other conditions remain unchanged. Simulation results are\npresented in Fig. 6. All the states converge to zero after a transitory vibration. The flap deflection limit causes a\nslightly longer convergent time to the closed-loop system with damping uncertainty. But it still converges faster\nthan the system without damping uncertainty, especially the pitch variable.\n5.2 Example 2\nIn this example, the wing section illustrated in Fig. 1 was considered again to simulate the flutter suppression\nby using both TE and LE control surfaces. Reference [31] presented an experimental wing section with both TE\nand LE control surfaces. The system parameters are listed in table 2. A third order polynomial model of the\nstiffness is built from static measurements on the nonlinear pitch cam. And the coefficients of nonlinear pitch\nstiffness used in simulation are {ki} = [12.77 53.47 1003.0]. The pitch damping coefficient is {ci} = [0.036 0 0].\nThe open-loop system was investigated first. Similar with example 1, the flutter speed is dependent on the\ninitial conditions. Numbers of simulations were performed with different initial conditions. We find that with\n10\ninitial pitch angle \uf061\uf020(0) and plunge displacement h (0) vary in the field of [0.001, 0.5], the flutter speed may\nchanges from 10.6 m\/s to 11.4 m\/s. Compared with example 1, the flutter speed of example 2 is less sensitive on\nthe initial conditions. That may because the pitch spring of example 2 is stiffer, as shown in Fig. 2. For the initial\nconditions h (0) = 0.01 m, \uf061(0) = 0.1 rad, and \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0290 0 0h \uf061\uf03d \uf03d\uf026 \uf026 , the critical flutter velocity is 10.7 m\/s. When\nfree stream velocity is lower than the flutter speed, all the 4 states converge to zero quickly. Figure 7 shows the\ntime histories and phase diagrams of convergent responses for U = 10.0 m\/s. And Fig. 8 presents a case of LCOs\nfor U = 15.0 m\/s.\nThe SMR adaptive control law expressed in Eq. (23) and parameter estimate update law Eq. (31) were\napplied to control the LCOs of the aeroelastic system with both TE and LE control surfaces. The initial\nconditions keep unchanged, and the 6 initial estimations of the uncertainty parameters were set to be zero. The\nsimulation was run at a free stream velocity U=15 m\/s beyond the system flutter velocity (10.7 m\/s). Both the\nLE and TE control surface deflections were limited up to \u00b115 deg and actuated at time t=3s. Figure 9 shows the\nresponse time histories of the closed-loop system in plunging, pitching, TE, and LE deflection. It is clear that the\nresponses in pitch and plunge are damping out in less than 2s. Further extensive simulations were performed for\nhigher free stream velocity. It was noted that when the velocity approached U=28.3 m\/s, the controller became\nless effective in suppressing the limit circle oscillation.\nThe effect of damping uncertainty has been investigated. In lower free stream velocity range, the two\nclosed-loop aeroelastic systems with and without damping uncertainty have almost the same behavior and\nresponse. When the free stream velocity approaches the flutter speed of the closed-loop system however, their\nclosed-loop system responses are significantly different. Fig. 10 shows an case at the velocity U=28 m\/s. The\nflutter speed of the closed-loop system without damping uncertainty is U=27.7 m\/s, which is below U=28.3 m\/s.\nObviously, flutter speed is dependent on the control surface deflection limits. Figure 11 shows the difference of\nflutter speeds between the systems with and without damping uncertainty. We find that with the control surface\nmaximum deflection increasing from 10 deg to 20 deg, the closed-loop aeroelastic system including damping\nuncertainty has higher flutter speeds.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper, the effect of damping uncertainty on the controller design and effectiveness for flutter\nsuppression of a wing section model has been investigated. Open-loop flutter characters of the two wing section\nhaven been studied firstly. Then, two adaptive control laws for a 2-D nonlinear aeroelastic airfoil with stiffness\nand damping uncertainties in pitch have been derived. For the wing section of a single trailing-edge control only,\nan adaptive control law was designed based on partial feedback linearization. Simulation results show that the\ndamping uncertainty has positive effect on the control effectiveness. The closed-loop system considering\ndamping uncertainty has quicker response to control and more effectiveness in flutter suppression. For the wing\nsection having both LE and TE control surfaces, a SMR adaptive control law was derived. Simulation results\nshow that the SMR adaptive controller considering the damping uncertainty is also effective in low free stream\nvelocity range. In higher velocity however, the effectiveness of the controller reduces although the flutter\nvelocity of the closed-loop system is greater due to the damping uncertainty.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the National Nature Science Grant of China:\n90916006 and the EC funding for the EU FP7 collaborative project SADE.\n11\nReferences\n[1] B.H.K.
