Earlier literature on \fscal accountability has typically adopted a top-down\nview of accountability, where spending agents are monitored by some higher-ranking institution\nlike a regulatory authority. Here we focus instead on a bottom-up notion of accountability, which\nwe could label `grass-roots accountability': monitoring of spending authorities by the \fnal users of\nthe publicly provided goods.\nBuchanan's (1963) early contribution to the analysis of tax earmarking focused on its implica-\ntions for \fscal choices under majority voting. Although later authors have studied di\u000berent aspects\nof tax earmarking, a potentially important dimension of it has so far been neglected, namely, the\nlinkage between tax earmarking and private monitoring of spending agencies by taxpayers. The\nidea that private agents' involvement can play an important role in ensuring \fscal discipline has\nbeen a recurring theme in the debate over government provision of services both in the Europe and\nNorth-America, although it has received comparatively less attention in the theoretical literature;\nthe only paper we know of to explicitly look at this issue is Davis and Hayes (1993). In what\nfollows, we explicitly formalize this idea and explore its implications for tax earmarking.\nWe describe a model of \fscal choices where the spending agencies that are responsible for the\nprovision of public goods and services have private information about the costs they incur, and\nwhere citizens can undertake costly monitoring whenever they receive goods and services from the\nagency. We then characterize mixed-strategy equilibria of the resulting noncooperative game and\nexamine how they depend on the tax earmarking regime.\nOur \fndings show that earmarking certain taxes to certain uses can foster accountability of\nspending authorities to taxpayers independently of the manner in which taxes and spending cat-\negories are matched. This is because, as long as private agents make di\u000berential contributions\nto di\u000berent revenue sources (because of preference or endowment heterogeneity), earmarking can\nreduce free-riding in private monitoring.\n1\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 considers\nthe no-earmarking case, and Section 4 that of full earmarking. Section 5 compares the two and\nconcludes.\n2 The Model\nWe model the e\u000bects of earmarked taxes by considering two agencies, denoted A and B, providing\n1\nIt is well understood that institution design can help reduce free riding in private monitoring. La\u000bont and Tirole\n(1994, Chapter 15) discuss this idea in a model of regulatory capture, and show that the optimal pricing rule to be\nadopted by the regulator may depend on whether or not the regulator is benevolent: with a self-interested regulator,\nAverage Cost Pricing regulation may outperform Marginal Cost Pricing regulation because it encourages consumers\nto monitor the regulator. Our analysis can be viewed as an application of these ideas to the case of self-interested\ngovernment agencies providing public goods, with earmarking rules playing a role analogous to that played by pricing\nrules in a regulatory context.\n1\ntwo di\u000berent public goods, to 2n consumers. Thus, good i 2 fA;Bg is produced by agency i,\ncombining a certain amount of labour inputs, e (e\u000bort by the agency), with other intermediate\ninputs, r, according to technologies which can be represented by a concave production function\nq(e; r; \u0012\ni\n), where \u0012\ni\nrepresents a factor-neutral shift parameter. The possible input combinations\nneeded to produce a unit of the good A can be represented by a unit isoquant described by the\ncondition q(e; r; \u0012\ni\n) = 1. For the purposes of our analysis, it is convenient to represent substitution\npossibilities between the two inputs by means of functions e(r; \u0012\ni\n) and r(e; \u0012\ni\n), both increasing in\n\u0012\ni\nand decreasing respectively in r and e. Technologies are subject to random exogenous shocks\nwhich are modelled as shifts in \u0012\ni\n, and are assumed to be independent and uncorrelated across\nagencies. We assume that there are only two possible realizations: \u0012 and \u0012, with \u0012 > \u0012, occurring\nwith probabilities respectively equal to \u0019 and \u0019 = 1 \u0000 \u0019 (the same possible lotteries on outcomes\nare assumed for both agencies) .\nEach agency is viewed as being composed of bureaucrats who are paid a \fxed salaryW to exert\nan e\u000bort equal to unity, and who have private information about cost conditions. If an agency\nreveals the true state of technologies, it will be required to exert an e\u000bort equal to one, which\ninvolves using an amount r(1; \u0012\ni\n) of inputs, with i 2 fA;Bg. If agency i misrepresents the true\ntechnological conditions when \u0012\ni\n= \u0012, it will be able to employ an amount of inputs equal to r(1; \u0012)\nand reduce its e\u000bort to e(r(1; \u0012); \u0012) < e(r(1; \u0012); \u0012) = 1, while if the misrepresentation occurs when\n\u0012\ni\n= \u0012, e\u000bort will increase to e(r(\u0012); \u0012) > e(r(\u0012); \u0012) = 1. The cost of the publicly provided good thus\ndepends on the realization of the state and on whether or not the agency \\lies\". In the following,\nwe shall denote by \u0015\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n) 2 f0; 1g the agency's reporting strategy, with \u0015(\u0012\ni\n) = 0 if the agency tells\nthe truth and \u0015\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n) = 1 if it lies. We shall also make use of the shorthand R(\u0012\ni\n) \u0011 r(1; \u0012\ni\n).\nAlthough information about costs is private, individual citizens can undertake costly monitoring\nof the local agencies e\u000bort whenever they receive goods and services. The idea here is that the\npublic have an opportunity to directly observe bureaucratic performance and have channels that\nthey can use to censor abuses (such as formal complaints or other forms of legal or politically\nrelevant actions). If any of the citizens decides to monitor the agency and the agency has lied\nabout cost conditions, the true state will be uncovered with certainty, and the agency will be forced\nto exert an e\u000bort equal to 1 and incur a penalty F .\nLet us denote by \u0016\ni\nh\n2 f0; 1g, h 2 f1; : : : ; 2ng, citizen h's monitoring choice, with \u0016\ni\nh\n= 1\nrepresenting the choice to monitor agency i by a citizen h and \u0016\ni\nh\n= 0 the choice not to monitor;\nalso, let ~\u0016\ni\ndenote the pro\fle of consumers' monitoring choices with respect to agency i. Then, the\ncost of public good provision by agency i, denoted as c\ni\n, depends on technological conditions and\non the strategies of both the agency and the citizens:\nc\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n; \u0015\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n); ~\u0016\nA\n) \u0011W +\n\u0000\n1\u0000 (1\u0000 \u0000\ni\n(~\u0016\ni\n))\u0015\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n)\n\u0001\nR(\u0012\ni\n) + (1\u0000 \u0000\ni\n(~\u0016\ni\n))\u0015\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n)R(\n^\n\u0012\ni\n);\ni 2 fA;Bg; (1)\nwhere \u0000\ni\n(~\u0016\ni\n) \u0011 1I\nP\nh\n\u0016\ni\nh\n>0\nis an index function which takes a value of 1 whenever\nP\nh\n\u0016\ni\nh\n> 0, i.e.\nwhen at least one citizen monitors, and is zero otherwise.\n2\nMonitoring is costly for consumers. Consumers are endowed with a certain amount of time\nwhich they can either sell on the labour market at a given wage rate or use for monitoring an\nagency (or both agencies). We shall denote with Y potential before-tax income, and with M the\nopportunity cost (in terms of foregone earnings) of monitoring one agency. The monitoring cost\nincreases to 2M if the consumer decides to monitor both agencies.\nThe agencies' services are paid for by consumer taxes, which may or may not be earmarked to a\nspeci\fc agency. Taxes are anonymous, but can a\u000bect di\u000berent individuals di\u000berentially because of\ntheir di\u000berent consumption patterns: a tax on cigarettes is only paid by smokers (if one abstracts\nfrom general equilibrium e\u000bects) and a tax on fuel is only paid by car users. Here, we shall make\nthe extreme assumption that there exist two separate consumer types, 1 and 2, each consisting of n\nindividuals, each buying a private good|completely unrelated to the public goods supplied by the\nagencies|in a \fxed amount equal to unity: type-1 consumers consume private good 1 on which a\nunit tax at rate t\n1\nis levied, and type-2 consumers consume private good 2 and pay a unit tax t\n2\n.\n2\nIf tax revenues are not earmarked, then the total cost of providing the public goods is \fnanced\nby the sum of the revenues from each tax. If we let t\n1\n= t\n2\n\u0011 t, then the tax required will be\nt\nNE\n1\n(c\nA\n; c\nB\n) = t\nNE\n2\n(c\nA\n; c\nB\n) = t\nNE\n(c\nA\n; c\nB\n) =\nc\nA\n+ c\nB\n2n\n: (2)\nEarmarking of taxes can be achieved by instituting a link between a speci\fc tax revenue \row and\na certain agency. Suppose, arbitrarily, that the cost of provision incurred by agency A is \fnanced\nby taxes on good 1, with the cost for B being \fnanced by taxes on good 2. Then we have\nt\nE\n1\n(c\nA\n; c\nB\n) =\nc\nA\nn\n; t\nE\n2\n(c\nA\n; c\nB\n) =\nc\nB\nn\n:\n3\n(3)\nDenote the payo\u000b of a representative type-j (j 2 f1; 2g) consumer k 2 f1; : : : ; ng as Z\nj\nk\n.

Throughout our analysis we shall\nassume risk-neutral citizens, i.e. U(Y ) = Y .\n4\n2\nThere is no reason to restrict the number of consumer types to two, to assume that each consumer type is only\na\u000bected by a single tax (typically individuals are a\u000bected by all taxes), or to assume consumption to be independent\nof level of taxation, except that this simpli\fed speci\fcation is convenient and su\u00c6cient to develop our argument.\nClearly, tax earmarking raises distributional considerations, which are not captured by our symmetric treatment of\nconsumers and which would come into play in a more realistic model.\n4\nAdopting a more general utility function allowing for risk aversion would introduce a tradeo\u000b between insurance\nand monitoring incentives, which is not essential to our argument.\n3\nEach agency's payo\u000b only depends on the state and strategies directly a\u000becting it, and can be\nexpressed as\nL\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n; \u0015\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n); ~\u0016\ni\n) \u0011\nW \u0000\n\u0010\n1\u0000 (1\u0000 \u0000\ni\n(~\u0016\ni\n))\u0015\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n)(1\u0000 e(R(\n^\n\u0012\ni\n); \u0012\ni\n))\n\u0011\nv \u0000 \u0000\ni\n(~\u0016\ni\n)\u0015\ni\n(\u0012\ni\n)F; i 2 fA;Bg; (5)\nwhere v the constant marginal valuation of e\u000bort. For the agency, misrepresenting cost conditions\ninvolves a change in e\u000bort and the prospect a penalty F if monitoring occurs.\n5\nIn the unfavourable\nstate (\u0012 = \u0012), telling the truth will always be a dominant strategy for the agency, since it results in\nlower e\u000bort and no penalty; hence in the remainder of our discussion we shall take \u0015(\u0012) = 0. But,\nin the favourable state (\u0012 = \u0012), the agency will have an incentive to misrepresent cost conditions in\norder to reduce e\u000bort, which it will have to weigh against the potential penalty it faces if monitoring\ntakes place.\nThe citizens and the agencies play an `inspection game' (La\u000bont and Tirole, 1994) where the\nagencies announce their cost conditions and, simultaneously,\n6\nconsumers decide whether or not to\nmonitor the agencies. In this game, each agency can adopt a mixed strategy, whereby it cheats\n(misrepresent cost) with probability q\ni\nand does not cheat with probability 1 \u0000 q\ni\n. Each citizen\ncan similarly mix between monitoring and not monitoring either or both agencies. The monitoring\nprobabilities of the citizens are denoted as p\ni\nh\n, with i 2 fA;Bg; and h 2 f1; : : : ; 2ng: Pure- or fully\nmixed-strategy equilibria can arise in this game, depending on parameter values.\n3 No Earmarking\nWe shall begin by considering \frst the no-earmarking case. A consumer has four possible actions,\nto monitor one of A or B, monitor both agencies, or monitor neither. Note that there will never\nbe pure-strategy equilibria where any of the citizens monitors an agency with probability one:\nif monitored with certainty, an agency would choose never to cheat, which in turn implies that\nmonitoring all the time could not be an equilibrium best response. Hence, the only possible pure-\nstrategy equilibrium involves all citizens choosing never to monitor and both agencies cheating:\n5\nFor expositional convenience we assume that the penalty is incurred whenever the agency lies, whatever the state.\nIt may seem incongruous to punish the agency for exerting extra e\u000bort when \u0012 = \u0012; as we shall see, however, the\nagency never lies in this case, independently of whether or not a penalty is applied, and therefore this assumption is\nfully innocuous.\n6\nWemodel the game as simultaneous rather than sequential for simplicity. They key feature here is that monitoring\nby citizens encourages agencies to be more e\u00c6cient. Sequentiality would not add much to this basic incentive\nstructure, other than the ability by consumers to compare announcements across di\u000berent agencies and update their\npriors accordingly.\n4\nProposition 1: There exists a (symmetric) pure-strategy Nash equilibrium which involves all cit-\nizens choosing not to monitor and all agencies cheating i\u000b\nM >\n\u0019(\u0012 \u0000 \u0012)\n2n\n: (6)\nProof: Consider consumer h. Given p\ni\ns\n= 0;8s 6= h, i 2 fA;Bg, and q\nA\n= q\nB\n= 1; consumer h\nwould choose not to monitor, given that no other consumer monitors, if and only if the expected\nutility from monitoring an agency{which equals Y \u0000M \u0000 ((1 + \u0019)\u0012 + \u0019\u0012)=(2n)|is less than that\nfrom not monitoring it|which equals Y \u0000 \u0012=n; this implies condition (6) above. \u0003\nSuch a pure-strategy equilibrium will only prevail in situations where monitoring costs are\ntoo high from the point of view of individual consumers for monitoring to be worthwhile, and is\ntherefore not very interesting. Note that, for a given M , the right-hand side of (6) is decreasing\nin n, which implies that private monitoring can only be observed if group size is not \\too large\",\nand is therefore more relevant for situations where the number of taxpayers is relatively small, as\nin the case of local agencies providing goods paid for by local taxes.\nIfM < \u0019(\u0012\u0000\u0012)=(2n) and there are no symmetric pure-strategy equilibria, by the Nash existence\ntheorem there will exist a symmetric-mixed strategy (Bayesian) equilibrium in which the consumers\nrandomize between inspecting and not inspecting and the agency always announces the truth when\n\u0012 = \u0012 and lies with some probability when \u0012 = \u0012. Let\n\n \u0011\n(1\u0000 \u000b)v\nF + (1\u0000 \u000b)v\n< 1: (7)\nThen, we can characterize symmetric mixed-strategy equilibria as follows:\nProposition 2: A mixed-strategy equilibrium with no earmarking has\np\nA\nh\n= p\nB\nh\n= p\n\u0003NE\n= 1\u0000 (1\u0000 \n)\n1=(2n)\n; (8)\nand\nq\nA\n= q\nB\n= q\n\u0003NE\n=\n2M(1\u0000 \n)\n1=(2n)\n\u0019(1\u0000 \n)(\u0012 \u0000 \u0012)\n: (9)\nProof: In a fully-mixed equilibrium, each agency, when facing a favourable cost realization, must\nbe indi\u000berent between telling the truth and lying. Let ~p represent the pro\fle of consumers' mixed\nstrategies, and ~p\n\u0000h\nthe vector of mixing probabilities of all citizens except h. When \u0012 = \u0012, the\nexpected payo\u000b for an agency i as a function of her reporting strategy \u0015\ni\n(\u0012) is given by the ex-\npectation E(L\ni\n(\u0012; \u0015\ni\n(\u0012); ~\u0016\ni\n) j ~p ) \u0011 \b(\u0015\ni\n(\u0012); ~p ). Indi\u000berence between truthfully reporting costs and\nlying requires\n\b(1; ~p ) = \b(0; ~p ); i 2 fA;Bg: (10)\nBecause of risk neutrality and of the fact that monitoring costs are linear in the number of\nagencies monitored, the expected payo\u000b from any strategy combination (\u0016\nA\nh\n; \u0016\nB\nh\n) to any citizen\n5\nh is additively separable across agencies. Thus, in a symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium we\ncan simply require that a consumer be indi\u000berent between never monitoring a certain agency i\nand monitoring it with probability one, given the strategies of all other players. Suppose then\nthat a consumer monitors A with probability p\nA\nh\n. Consumer h's expected payo\u000b as a func-\ntion of her monitoring choice \u0016\nB\nh\nwith respect to agency B is then given by the expectation\nE(Z\nh\n(\u0012\nA\n; \u0012\nB\n;\u0015\nA\n(\u0012\nA\n); \u0015\nB\n(\u0012\nB\n);\u0016\nA\nh\n; \u0016\nB\nh\n; ~\u0016\nA\n\u0000h\n; ~\u0016\nB\n\u0000h\n) j \u0019; \u0019; q\nA\n; q\nB\n; ~p\n\u0000h\n; p\nA\nh\n) \u0011 \t(\u0016\nB\nh\n; q\nA\n; q\nB\n; ~p\n\u0000h\n; p\nA\nh\n). In-\ndi\u000berence requires\n\t(1; q\nA\n; q\nB\n; ~p\n\u0000h\n; p\nA\nh\n) = \t(0; q\nA\n; q\nB\n; ~p\n\u0000h\n; p\nA\nh\n); h 2 f1; : : : ; 2ng: (11)\nSubstituting expressions (4), (5), and (2) into (10) and (11), and letting q\ni\n= q\n\u0003NE\n; i 2 fA;Bg,\nand p\ni\nh\n= p\n\u0003NE\n; h 2 f1; : : : ; 2ng; i 2 fA;Bg, gives conditions (8) and (9) above. \u0003\nNote that the equilibrium probability of monitoring is directly related to the savings in e\u000bort\nfrom cheating{represented by (1 \u0000 \u000b)v in \n|and inversely related to the penalty. The aggregate\nmonitoring e\u000bort, as measured by the probability of being monitored for an agency|which equals\n1\u0000 (1\u0000 p\n\u0003NE\n)\n2n\n= (1\u0000 \u000b)v=(F + (1\u0000\u000b)v)|is independent of the number of consumers involved.\nThe equilibrium probability of cheating, on the other hand, is inversely related to the number of\nindividuals (the denominator of (9) is decreasing in n). Thus, once the conditions for a mixed-\nstrategy equilibrium are met, free-riding incentives in monitoring are re\rected in the equilibrium\nlevel of cheating.\n3 Full Earmarking\nWith full earmarking, the taxes payable by a consumer only depend on the action of the agency\nto which the revenues from such taxes are earmarked. Consider, for example, a consumer k 2\nf1; : : : ; ng of type 1 whose taxes are earmarked to agency A. The choice to monitor both agencies\nis clearly dominated by that of monitoring agency A only. The agencies thus face the same payo\u000bs\nas in the no earmarking case, except that now the number of consumers that can potentially monitor\nany agency is now only n.\nAs in the no-earmarking case, we can determine an upper bound on M above which consumers\nwill never choose to monitor (the proof is analogous to that of Proposition 1):\nProposition 3: Under full tax earmarking, there exists a (symmetric) pure-strategy Nash equilib-\nrium which involves all citizens choosing not to monitor and all agencies cheating i\u000b\nM >\n\u0019(\u0012 \u0000 \u0012)\nn\n: (12)\nNote that (12) implies (6). Thus, if there is no symmetric pure-strategy equilibrium in the full\nearmarking case, then there is not one in the no earmarking case either. Symmetric mixed-strategy\nequilibria under full earmarking can be characterized as follows:\n6\nProposition 4: When taxes are fully earmarked, the equilibrium probability of monitoring and of\ncheating in the symmetric mixed-strategy equilibrium is given by\np\n1A\nk\n= p\n2B\nk\n= p\n\u0003E\n= 1\u0000 (1\u0000 \n)\n1=n\n: (13)\nand\nq\nA\n= q\nB\n= q\n\u0003E\n=\nM(1\u0000 \n)\n1=n\n\u0019(1\u0000\n)(\u0012 \u0000 \u0012)\n: (14)\nProof: With full earmarking there are only two possible meaningful actions possible for a con-\nsumer: she can either monitor the agency to which the taxes she pays are earmarked or not monitor\nat all. Suppose that, arbitrarily, the revenues from taxes paid by type-1 consumers are earmarked to\nagency A, with the same applying to type-2 consumers and agency B, and focus on the monitoring\nchoice of type-1 consumers. The expected payo\u000b for a representative consumer k 2 f1; : : : ; ng of\ntype 1 as a function of her monitoring choice with respect to agency A, and given that no type-1 con-\nsumer will never monitorB, is given by the expectation E(Z\n1\nk\n(\u0012\nA\n; \u0012\nB\n;\u0015\nA\n(\u0012\nA\n); \u0015\nB\n(\u0012\nB\n);\u0016\nA\nk\n; 0; ~\u0016\nA\n\u0000k\n; ~\u0016\nB\n\u0000k\n) j\n\u0019; \u0019; q\nA\n; q\nB\n; (~p\n1A\n\u0000k\n;\n~\n0); (\n~\n0; ~p\n2B\n\u0000k\n)) \u0011\n^\n\t\n1\n(\u0016\n1A\nk\n; q\nA\n; q\nB\n; (~p\n1A\n\u0000k\n;\n~\n0); (\n~\n0; ~p\n2B\n\u0000k\n)). Indi\u000berence requires\n^\n\t\n1\n(1; q\nA\n; q\nB\n; ~p\n\u0000h\n) =\n^\n\t\n1\n(0; q\nA\n; q\nB\n; ~p\n\u0000h\n); k 2 f1; : : : ; 2ng: (15)\nThe same applies to type-2 consumers with a change of indices.\nUsing (15) in conjunction with (10), substituting expressions (4), (5), and (3) into (10) and\n(15), and letting q\ni\n= q\n\u0003E\n; i 2 fA;Bg, and p\n1A\nk\n= p\n2B\nk\n= p\n\u0003E\n; k 2 f1; : : : ; ng, gives conditions (13)\nand (14) above. \u0003\n5 Comparison and Conclusions\nWe will now show that under our assumptions there will be an unambiguous decrease in cheating\nwhen earmarking is used:\nProposition 5: Assume M < \u0019(\u0012 \u0000 \u0012)=n. Then, the equilibrium probability of cheating by a\nrepresentative agency is less under full tax earmarking than with no earmarking, i.e. q\n\u0003E\n< q\n\u0003NE\n.\nProof: Comparing expressions (14) and (9), it is easily seen that q\n\u0003NE\n> q\n\u0003E\nrequires 2(1\u0000\n)\n1=2n\n>\n(1\u0000 \n)\n1=n\n. Since (1 \u0000\n) 2 (0; 1), this condition is always met. \u0003\nTax earmarking thus provides a way of mitigating agency problems in public provision. More-\nover, it should be stressed that the precise manner in which taxes are earmarked is totally immaterial\nfor it to be e\u000bective: in the model just described the tax base here is completely independent of\nthe goods and services publicly provided, and the assignment of tax bases to spending categories\nis fully arbitrary. This means that, even when user charges are not available|as is the case with\nhealth and education services in many countries|tax earmarking can still play a positive role in\nfostering accountability, particularly with respect to local government agencies.\n7\nReferences\nBuchanan, J.M.
