PCR is essentially a three-\nstage process that amplifies the region of DNA lying\nbetween two short stretches of sequence that comple-\nment primer sequences (Newton and Graham, 1997). In\nthis process double stranded DNA template is separated\ninto two single strands by heating (denaturing), then the\nreaction is cooled so that primers complementing the\nshort stretches of DNA either side of the region of\ninterest may bind (annealing). DNA polymerase then\nuses the template sequence to extend the bound primer\n(extension). A simple formula for the final number of\ncopies of the target double-stranded sequence under\nideal conditions is known for numbers of cycles greater\nthan two: \u00f02n \u0002 2n\u00dex where n is the number of cycles, 2n\nrepresents products after the first and second cycles that\nhave undefined length due to having bound only one\nprimer, and x is the number of copies of the original\ntemplate (Newton and Graham, 1997).\nInitially, PCR found use mostly for the accurate\namplification of known DNA sequences, but PCR-\nbased gene manipulation has become invaluable for the\nalteration of genetic information at the molecular level,\npermitting site-directed mutagenesis of PCR products at\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nL. Pritchard et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 234 (2005) 497\u2013509498an arbitrary distance from the ends of the template\nsequence (Barik, 1998; Tait and Horton, 1998). One\nsuch general mechanism for inducing randomised\nnucleotide sequences via PCR is the use of mutagenic\n(overhanging) primers. This form of mutagenic PCR\nalso found a crucial role in in vitro selection methods (a\nprotocol in use before PCR itself was used to generate\nthe initial, randomised libraries) (Nieuwlandt, 1998).\nWith in vitro selection a random oligonucleotide library\nwould be expressed and screened; high-performing\nvariants from this library would then be retained and\naccurately amplified, and the expression\/screening cycle\nwould begin again, in analogy with Darwinian selection.\nError-prone PCR introduces random copying errors\nby imposing imperfect, and thus mutagenic, or \u2018sloppy\u2019,\nreaction conditions (e.g. by adding Mn2\u00fe or Mg2\u00fe to the\nreaction mixture (Cadwell and Joyce, 1991; Leung et al.,\n1989)). This method has proven useful both for genera-\ntion of randomised libraries of nucleotide sequences, and\nalso for the introduction of mutations during the\nexpression and screening process in a mutagenesis step.\nWhile early directed evolution experiments were\nlargely based on selection-amplification procedures,\nmore recent protocols incorporate gene shuffling as the\nmajor mutagenic process. The essential procedure of\nstepwise screening, where the mutant library is screened\nfor the desired function and either the fittest protein or\nsome recombinant of several of the fittest mutants\nbecomes the parent for the next generation, remains the\nsame (Moore et al., 1997; Voigt et al., 2001; Zhao and\nArnold, 1997). Although the emphasis of more recent\nmutagenesis methods is on shuffling, point mutations\nremain likely to occur even when not purposefully\ninduced (Sun, 1995). In early studies of PCR, substitu-\ntion, addition and deletion of bases by DNA polymerase\nwas noted and several models of the substitution process\nhave been proposed to describe this. We briefly\nsummarise some of these approaches below.\nThe theory of Galton\u2013Watson processes has been\nemployed to determine the theoretical proportion of\nDNA sequences with no mutations after n PCR cycles,\nassuming perfect amplification efficiency, and a constant\nmutation rate m (Krawczak et al., 1989). This and some\nother models, e.g. Hayashi (1990) however only report\nthe fraction of perfect copies, and give no detailed\ninformation about any mutations that occur, such as the\nnature of substitutions or their locations.\nPCR is represented as a bifurcating tree in the model\nof Weiss and von Haeseler (1995), and the distribution\nof duplication events between random pairs as a\nfunction of amplification efficiency, number of tem-\nplates, mutation rate and number of PCR cycles is\nfound. An advance seen in this model is its examination\nof the influence of variable amplification efficiency. The\nsubstitution rate was assumed to be uniform and base-\nindependent, however.In Sun (1995) the author also represents PCR as a\nbranching process, studying the number of mutations\nand the distribution of the Hamming distance between\nrandomly-selected pairs of product sequences after n\nPCR cycles for arbitrary mutation rate and amplifica-\ntion efficiency. This work is a generalisation of the\nmodels proposed by Hayashi (1990), Krawczak et al.\n(1989) and Maruyama (1990). However, none of these\nmodels take base-dependent rates of substitution into\naccount.\nWe take as our starting point in this paper the model\nof error-prone PCR proposed in Moore and Maranas\n(2000), with the aim of extending it to incorporate\narbitrary template population size and amplification\nefficiency. This model appears to have been constructed\nwith the particular aim of calculating the probability\nthat a given nucleotide sequence will be generated in a\nsingle error-prone PCR experiment, and has a different\nstructure to the models described above, being built\naround the recursive application of a mutation data\nmatrix of base substitution probabilities, thereby mod-\nelling a base-dependent mutation rate. This base-\ndependence is an improvement over, e.g. the models\ndescribed in Eckert and Kunkel (1991) and Sun (1995).\nThe original results of Moore and Maranas (2000) were\nonly generalised for a total number N of PCR cycles, but\nnot for either variable amplification efficiency or\nvariable template population. Both of these may be\nimportant factors for mutagenesis by \u2018sloppy\u2019 PCR, as\nthey would be expected to affect the overall, observed\nmutation rate for the experiment.\nOne disadvantage of the recursive MDM approach in\ncomparison with models based on branching processes\nis that it is not directional in terms of sequence space.\nEach successive sequence that is sampled from the\nvirtual PCR pot is a random sampling from the entire\nsequence space potentially reachable by the experiment,\nrather than a sampling of the sequence space described\nby a single genealogy of sequences rooted at the\ntemplate. The models described in Moore and Maranas\n(2000) and extensions in this paper therefore cannot\nprovide useful information on the sequence space\ncovered by a single PCR experiment, in terms of\nHamming distance between randomly-selected pairs of\nsequences from one PCR pot, unlike the model of Sun\n(1995). The models do however provide a useful\nestimate of the probability, taken over many experi-\nments, of obtaining a specified sequence given a\nparticular template sequence.\nIn this paper, we generalise the model proposed in\nMoore and Maranas (2000) to an arbitrary number of\ninitial template sequences (PCR rarely actually begins\nfrom only two strands). Additionally, since amplifica-\ntion efficiency for any particular cycle may be dependent\non the population size at the time of that cycle, or some\nother factor, we generalise the model to account for this\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nL. Pritchard et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 234 (2005) 497\u2013509 499also. That the population size in any cycle of a PCR\nexperiment is dependent on the initial population size,\nand may affect the progress of error-prone PCR was\nsuggested in the original paper (Moore and Maranas,\n2000), and is described more formally herein. We\nconsider that some plausible causes of variation in\namplification efficiency with population size\/number of\ncycles may be:\u0005 As population size increases, the number of free\nnucleotides relative to the number of sequences falls.\nThe probability of a complete extension of the\nsequence in later cycles may be reduced, as a\nresult\u0005 As the experiment proceeds, the proportion of active\npolymerase enzyme falls, relative to the number of\nsequences present, potentially reducing the efficiency\nof later cycles\u0005 As the experiment proceeds, the accumulated degra-\ndative effect of thermal cycling may reduce the\nefficiency of the Taq polymerase.The estimate of per-cycle mutation rate in an in vitro\nPCR experiment is often made by random sampling of\nsequences from the final \u2018pot\u2019. The distribution of the\nmutation frequency per sequence is expected to vary\nunder the effects listed above, and this in turn affects\nthe estimate of per-cycle mutation rate. We describe the\neffects of model and parameter choice on this\nestimate.2. Model\nThe protocol of the model proposed by Moore and\nMaranas (2000) may be summarised as follows:1. An initial mutation data matrix is defined represent-\ning nucleotide-dependent substitutions for a single\ncycle of the PCR experiment:\nM \u00bc\nMAA MAC MAG MAT\nMCA MCC MCG MCT\nMGA MGC MGG MGT\nMTA MTC MTG MTT\n0\nBBB@\n1\nCCCA: (1)\nHere, Mij represents the probability that nucleotide i\nwill be substituted by nucleotide j in a single PCR\ncycle.2. Mutation data matrices for successive cycles of the\nPCR experiment are generated (this is assumed to be\nindependent of other factors, such as the uneven\ndepletion of nucleotides that may have a large effectin real PCR).\nCnij \u00bc\ndij ; n \u00bc 0;\nMij ; n \u00bc 1;P\nk\u00bcA;C;G;T C\nn\u00021\nik \u0007 Mkj ; nX2;\n8><\n>: (2)\nwhere dij is the Kronecker delta.\n3. The number of sequences produced at each cycle n of\na PCR experiment that runs for a total of N cycles is\ncalculated as ZN ;n: These values will usually be\ndependent on the amplification efficiency, which itself\nmay be variable and dependent on the initial\npopulation size.

Pritchard et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 234 (2005) 497\u2013509500generates a sequence that is equivalent to the random\nselection of a single sequence from the final PCR\npot.\nFor simulations in which the amplification efficiency\nis not constant throughout the reaction, the variation\nmay take one of a range of forms. There may be a linear\ndecrease in efficiency with the number of completed\ncycles (analogous to the progressive denaturing of\npolymerase) or a linear decrease with total population\n(analogous to depletion of the relative concentration of\nnucleotides, polymerase or primer etc. with respect to\ntemplate). Alternatively, both effects may be seen\nsimultaneously, or there may be some combination of\nunconsidered nonlinear effects. For the simulation of\nvariable amplification efficiency described in this paper\nwe implement a numerical solution, describing only a\nlinear decrease in amplification efficiency with increasing\ntotal population, bounded by the initial template\npopulation at the initial amplification efficiency and an\nupper limit on the population size at amplification\nefficiency \u00bc 0. This makes the assumption that the\ndominant effect on amplification efficiency will be\nexpressed through the depletion of reagents for sequence\nextension. Selecting only one dominant effect allows for\ncomparison between the original Moore and Maranas\n(2000) model and generalised variants incorporating\nterms for variable amplification efficiency without\nintroducing further issues of parameterizing the\nbalance between polymerase degradation and dilution\neffects.3. Results and discussion\nWe implemented the Moore and Maranas (2000)\nmodel of PCR, and the variants described above in a\ncomputer program written in the Python programming\nlanguage by one of the authors (LP). The three variants\nare named, and differ from one another, as described\nbelow:1. MMo: The model of PCR as described in Moore and\nMaranas (2000). The model assumes perfect amplifi-\ncation efficiency (l \u00bc 1) and initially only two single\nstrands of template sequence.2. MMc: Generalisation of the MMo model to an\narbitrary number of initial template sequences, and\npossibly imperfect but constant amplification effi-\nciency (lp1)3. MMv: Generalisation of the MMo model to an\narbitrary number of initial template sequences, and a\nvariable amplification efficiency that decreases line-\narly as the total sequence population size grows to a\npredefined limit.3.1. Variation of the final number of sequences with\nmodelsFor in vitro PCR experiments, the sequence popula-\ntion does not increase indefinitely in an exponential\nmanner, but often reaches an upper limit due to\nconstraints of polymerase, primer and nucleotide avail-\nability, with secondary effects from polymerase degra-\ndation. Figs. 1a\u2013d describe the growth of total\npopulation of sequences in the PCR reaction with\nnumber of cycles for the three model variants. In the\nmodels, these results are entirely deterministic and are\nfound by solving Eqs. (4) and (5) for the appropriate\nparameters. For in vitro PCR, this idealism is probably\nnot appropriate, and there is likely to be stochastic\nvariation that deviates from these models.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 1a, the original model\ndescribed in Moore and Maranas (2000) results in\nexponential growth of the number of sequences and, as\nimplied by the model, this growth remains unchecked.\nThis is an unrealistic model of population increase in\nreal PCR experiments, as population growth is even-\ntually limited, possibly by the factors detailed above.\nFig. 1b demonstrates that generalisation of the MMo\nmodel to arbitrary initial population and arbitrary\namplification efficiency does not result in a pattern of\npopulation growth that is any more representative of a\nreal PCR experiment. As in the MMo model and Fig.\n1a, population growth is permitted to continue un-\nchecked. The introduction of a constant, imperfect\namplification efficiency (lo1) is therefore not sufficient\nto describe the commonly-observed variation with cycle-\nnumber of total population in an in vitro PCR\nexperiment.\nIn Fig. 1c, population growth for the MMv model\nwith variable amplification efficiency is described. The\nintroduction of variable amplification efficiency to the\nmodel causes a variation of the population curve from\nthose of the MMo and MMc models, where S0 and l0\nare large enough for the total population size to reach its\nlimit. A relationship in which amplification efficiency\nincreases with cycle number would result in even faster\nexponential growth than the MMo model. It is\npresumed that in real PCR experiments, amplification\nefficiency decreases with successive PCR cycles. To\nreflect this effect in the current study, amplification\nefficiency is set to decline linearly to zero at the\npopulation limit, with increasing total population. From\nFig. 1c, it is clear that, until the total population\napproaches an upper limit, growth of the sequence\npopulation proceeds exponentially as in the MMc\nmodel. Only at higher initial amplification efficiencies\ndoes the population size approach the limit, causing the\nplot to differ from that of the MMo model (Fig. 1a).\nAs is expected, increasing the initial population in the\nMMv model causes the population of the PCR\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nn\nCu\nm\nul\nat\nive\n p\nop\nul\nat\nio\nn\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nn\nCu\nm\nul\nat\nive\n p\nop\nul\nat\nio\nn\n0 5 10 15 20 25 3010\n4\n106\n108\n1010\n1012 1012\n104\n106\n108\n1010\n1012\n1014\n1010\n108\n106\n104\n102\n100\n1010\n108\n106\n104\n102\n100\nn\nCu\nm\nul\nat\nive\n p\nop\nul\nat\nio\nn\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nn\nCu\nm\nul\nat\nive\n p\nop\nul\nat\nio\nn\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFig. 1.

On a linear scale, the population profile is\napproximately sigmoidal, as routinely observed in RT-\nPCR experiments.\n3.2. Variation of ZN;n by model\nError-prone PCR may be used deliberately to\ngenerate random mutations, but the potential for\ngenerating random mutations is always present in any\nPCR experiment. In either case it is useful to be able to\npredict and understand the distribution and frequency\nof occurrence of random mutations. When deliberately\ngenerating random mutations to explore sequence space\nit is helpful to know the size of sequence space that may\npotentially be explored by the generated mutations;\nestimates of mutation rate per cycle and an under-\nstanding of how to maximize overall mutation rate per\nsequence are important to this aim. In the case of\namplifying or proof-reading PCR, where mutations are\nundesirable, it is useful to know how many random\nmutations are likely to occur, and how best to minimize\nthem. Again, an estimate of the mutation rate per cycleand an understanding of how to minimise overall\nmutation rate will be important. If the mutation rate is\nconstant for each generation, it is expected that the\nnumber of mutations observed in a single sequence\nextracted from the final pool will be proportional to the\nnumber of extension steps of which it is a product. What\nis important is how many sequences from each genera-\ntion are present in the final pool. This is represented by\nZN ;n; which denotes how many sequences present in the\npot after a total of N cycles are the result of n extension\nsteps. Control of the modal number of extension steps\nmay therefore be an important mechanism for determin-\ning overall mutation rate.\nFor example, we might consider two hypothetical\nPCR experiments with the same total number of cycles,\nMDM and the same final total number of sequences. In\none (perhaps unlikely) experiment, amplification effi-\nciency begins at a low value and increases towards the\nend of the experiment; ZN;n is then greatest at larger n\n(\u2018late-peaking\u2019). In the other experiment, amplification\nefficiency is initially high, but drops very rapidly; ZN ;n is\ngreatest at smaller n (\u2018early-peaking\u2019).The greatest\ncontribution to the final sequence set in the latter,\n\u2018early-peaking\u2019 experiment, comes from sequences that\nhave not been through many cycles and so do not carry\nmany mutations.

In all three model\ntypes, ZN ;n is deterministic, following from Eqs. (3) and\n(5), which were used to generate the plots in Fig. 2. We\nagain note that the distribution of ZN ;n may be\ninfluenced by stochastic effects in the case of in vitro\nPCR.\nZN ;n for the MMo model as defined in Moore and\nMaranas (2000), where N \u00bc 30; describes a symmetrical\ndistribution, with most sequences in the final pot being\nthe result of 15 or 16 extension steps (Fig. 2a).\nThe MMc model (Fig. 2b) introduces an arbitrary,\nbut constant, amplification efficiency. As amplification\nefficiency falls from l \u00bc 1; the total number of sequences\nproduced also declines, and so does the modal numberof extension steps (and therefore overall mutation rate\nper sequence) for each sequence in the final pot.\nAs there is no upper limit on the total number of\nsequences in the MMc model, it would be expected that\nif the initial template population was to be increased for\nconstant l; no shift in the modal value of n for the\nsequences would be seen, but that the total number of\nsequences that are the result of n extension steps would\nincrease. The overall observed mutation rate would\ntherefore be expected to be more dependent on l than\non S0: This is demonstrated in the plot of ZN ;n against n\nin Fig. 2c, and in Fig. 4b.\nThe gross effect of varying initial amplification\nefficiency for the MMv model (Fig. 2d) is much the\nsame as that seen with the MMc model (Fig. 2b) for an\ninitial population size S0 \u00bc 2: The effect of varying\ninitial population size, because it causes the rate at\nwhich l varies to change in turn, is significant and\nmarked (Figs. 2e and f). Fig. 2e has a similar profile of\nZN ;n scores by cycle to 2d. With an initial population\nsize S0 \u00bc 104; varying the initial amplification efficiency\n(as shown in Fig. 2e) exerts a similar effect by reducing\nthe modal number of extension steps for each of the final\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nL. Pritchard et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 234 (2005) 497\u2013509 503sequences as in the MMc model (Fig. 2d). The modal\nnumber of extensions (and to an extent, overall\nmutation rate) however, does not begin to fall until l0\nis greatly reduced. Hence, in contrast to the uncon-\nstrained MMc model, the MMv model is seen here to be\npractically insensitive to changes in l0 once the upper\npopulation limit is reached (this upper limit is reached\nfor l0X0:6).\nWhen the initial population size is increased from\nS0 \u00bc 2 to S0 \u00bc 100 (Fig. 2f) for l0 \u00bc 0:8; the upper\npopulation limit Slimit \u00bc 109 is not reached, the modal\nnumber of extension steps per sequence in the final pool\nvaries little, and the overall number of sequences that\nare the result of a given number of extension steps rises\nmuch less rapidly than for the MMc model. However, as\nthe initial template population increases more signifi-\ncantly, the population size limit is reached at a smaller\nnumber of cycles, so ln falls to zero, and the modal\nnumber of extension steps (and implicitly mutation rate)\nfalls (Fig. 2f), in contrast to the MMc model. The\nstrategy of varying mutation rate by varying initial\ntemplate population size has been used in commercial\nmutagenic PCR kits (e.g. Arezi et al., 2002). These\nmodels (Figs. 2c and f) imply that these methods are\nviable because there is a cycle-wise reduction in\namplification efficiency and\/or some constraint on total\npopulation size. It thus appears that the generalised\nMMc and MMv models imply a less broad search of\nsequence space for in vitro PCR than does the MMo\nmodel.\n3.3. Variation in probability of generating a given\nsequence by model\nAs seen above, the inclusion of variable amplification\nefficiencies and initial template population sizes implies\na notable effect of these factors on the observed number\nof substitutions per sequence (overall mutation rate)\ncompared to the original Moore and Maranas (2000)\nmodel. In the MMo model, the probability of assem-\nbling a sequence S through successive single point\nmutations on an original sequence S0 after N PCR\ncycles is given by\nPN\nS0;S\n\u00bc 1\nSN\nXN\nn\u00bc0\nZN ;n\nYB\nj\u00bc1\n\u00bdPn\ts0\nj\n;sj ; (7)\nwhere B is the length of the two sequences and s0j and sj\nare the nucleotides at position j for sequences S0 and S.\nThis provides a quantitative means of estimating a priori\nthe fraction of sequences in the final pool that conform\nto a target sequence S given the mutation data matrix M\nand initial sequence S 0: For the generation of functional\nnucleotide sequences this is adequate, but for the\ngeneration of functional proteins issues of codon\nredundancy must be taken into account with a set oftarget sequences S 2 fT1; T2; . . .g where Tn are nucleo-\ntide sequences that encode a desired protein target.\nThe above description also does not account precisely\nfor functional targeting. While one may have a good\nidea of which residues in a protein sequence one would\nwish to adapt for the development of improved or novel\nfunction, this function may also be achieved despite (or\neven because of) substitutions at unexpected locations\n(e.g. Zaccolo and Gherardi, 1999; Oue et al., 1999).\nAlso, the final pool of sequences generated by an in vitro\nPCR reaction is strongly dependent on the history of\nthat experiment. A single PCR experiment will typically\nsample a hyper-cone of the theoretically accessible\nsequence space, whereas the equation describing the\nprobability of assembling a prescribed target sequence\nby the model described herein implies a random\nsampling of the whole, theoretically accessible space.\nNevertheless, this probability is a useful metric for\nestimating of the extent of sequence space that can be\nexplored over many experiments given initial parameters\nof the model (assuming that each individual experiment\ngenerates a \u2018branch\u2019 of sequences independent of the\nother experiments in the set). As the model assumes no\nbranched evolution-like directionality in sequence evo-\nlution, its theoretically-accessible sequence space will\napproximate a B-dimensional \u2018Hamming sphere\u2019, or\nhypercube. Each point within this \u2018sphere\u2019 represents a\npossible target sequence, and the probabilities of the\nmodel generating the prescribed target sequence at any\nparticular point within this space are not uniformly\ndistributed, due to the base-dependent substitution\nprobabilities of the MDM. Thus, the \u2018Hamming sphere\u2019\nis distorted and, in particular, not all sequences of equal\nHamming distance from the original template S0 are\nequally likely after a total of N PCR cycles. The uneven\ncoverage of this space is expected to form a shell-like\nhypercube of high probability sequences and a tailing\noff of probabilities towards the template sequence\n(centre of the space) and towards sequences with B\nsubstitutions, reflecting, in section, the frequency\nprofiles of Figs. 2a\u2013f.\nIn order to estimate the coverage of this sequence\nspace, we used the MMo, MMc and MMv models\ndescribed above to estimate the mean probability of\ngenerating 31 target nucleotide sequences containing\nfrom 0 to 30 random base substitutions relative to a\ntemplate sequence. One hundred template sequences\nwere chosen randomly from the complete set of coding\nsequences in the fully-sequenced bacterial genomes\navailable at October 2004 from ftp.ncbi.nih.gov. Ten\nin silico PCR experiments were performed for each\ntemplate using the MMo model, the MMc model\n(l0 \u00bc 0:8; S0 \u00bc 2), and the MMv model with three\nsets of parameters: (l0 \u00bc 0:8; S0 \u00bc 2; Slimit \u00bc 108),\n(l0 \u00bc 0:8; S0 \u00bc 106; Slimit \u00bc 108) and (l0 \u00bc 0:2; S0 \u00bc 106;\nSlimit \u00bc 108).

The\ncorollary of this is that use of the MMo model to\nestimate mutation rate per cycle from such sampling of a\nPCR experiment may underestimate the true per-cycle\nmutation rate of the experiment.\n3.4. Variation in mean Hamming distance of generated\nsequences from template by model\nThe measure of mean Hamming distance is a proxy\nfor overall mean mutation rate, and is dependent on\ntemplate length, hence all measurements are normalised\nto template length. We examined the effect on the mean\nHamming distance from the initial template sequence of\n100 sequences randomly selected from the final pool of a\nPCR experiment (emulating the experimental estimation\nof mutation rate per cycle) for 100 templates randomly\nchosen from a large set of bacterial coding sequences, as\ndescribed above, using the MMo, MMc and MMv\nmodels under a broad range of parameter settings. In\nthe MMo model, only mutation rate per cycle may be\nvaried (0:002pmp0:010); for the MMc model, amplifi-\ncation efficiency (0:2plp1:0) and the initial templatetitutions in a sequence using the specified models and parameters\nMMva MMvb MMvc\n7.64E\u0002005 2.11E\u0002002 2.61E\u0002002\n5.63E\u0002014 8.18E\u0002014 1.33E\u0002013\n3.22E\u0002022 2.18E\u0002024 1.07E\u0002023\n7.61E\u0002030 3.89E\u0002034 1.02E\u0002032\n1.90E\u0002037 8.02E\u0002044 1.38E\u0002040\n1.16E\u0002045 2.08E\u0002051 7.08E\u0002050\n3.19E\u0002052 1.67E\u0002062 4.68E\u0002058\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nL.

The indicated\nstandard deviations suggest that estimation of mutation\nrate per cycle from this sampling scheme will be\nimprecise.\nReducing the amplification efficiency in the MMc\nmodel (Fig. 4b) results in a decline of mean Hamming\ndistance from the template, as a proportion of template\nlength, of sequences in the final pool. The effect is\nnot strongly dependent on variations in S0; as might\nbe expected intuitively. This is explained as a low\namplification efficiency reduces the number of amp-\nlification, and so mutation, events for the overall\nreaction.\nThe effect of decreasing amplification efficiency with a\n(reachable) limit on total experimental population size is2 4 6 8 10\nx 10-3\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n\u00b5\nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\n H\nam\nm\nin\ng \ndi\nst\nan\nce\n100\n105\n108\n1010\n1012\n0\n0.05\n0.1\nS0Slim\nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\n H\nam\nm\nin\ng \ndi\nst\nan\nce\n(b)\n(d)\nate per cycle for 100 randomly-sampled sequences from the final pool of\n) MMo model; (b) MMc model with l \u00bc 1:0 (circles), l \u00bc 0:8 (star),\nutation rate and l indicate results for S0 2 f2; 102; 104; 106g; (c) MMv\nt line), l0 \u00bc 0:6 (dashed line), l0 \u00bc 0:4 (dotted line) and l0 \u00bc 0:2 (thick\ninitial template population S0 and population limit Slimit for the MMv\n6 (dashed line), m \u00bc 0:004 (dotted line) and m \u00bc 0:002 (thick solid line).\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n0.03\n0.05\n0.07\nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\n H\nam\nm\nin\ng \ndi\nst\nan\nce\n0.045\n0.050\n0.055\n0.060\nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\n H\nam\nm\nin\ng \ndi\nst\nan\nce\n1 3 4 5 6 7 8 10\n0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\n0.08\nGC content\/%\nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\n H\nam\nm\nin\ng \ndi\nst\nan\nce\n92\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 5.

Pritchard et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 234 (2005) 497\u2013509506seen in Fig. 4c for the MMv model. Here, S0 is set to\n106; and at this value moderate reductions of l0 do not\nhave a significant effect on mean Hamming distance as a\nproportion of sequence length. As S0 is close to Slimit;\nthe total number of generated sequences is similar for\nlarge values of l0 due to the restriction of total\npopulation size that results from a rapid, early reduction\nin amplification efficiency. At lower values of S0; this\nearly total population size \u2018capping\u2019 effect is not seen,\nand a reduction in mean Hamming distance is seen for\neach value of m; the same effect as seen for the MMc\nmodel. The upper limit on population size thus has a\nsimilarly limiting effect on the region of sequence space\nexplored by a PCR experiment, where the initial\ntemplate population is large enough. For all l0;\nincreasing m results in an increase in mean Hamming\ndistance. Variations in l during the experiment need not\nbe controlled only by population size, and this suggests\nan alternative mechanism for maximising the explora-\ntion of sequence space in a single error-prone PCR\nexperiment.\nFig. 4d shows the effect of varying S0 and Slimit for a\nrange of mutation rates at l \u00bc 0:8: There is a general\ntendency for the mean Hamming distance, normalised\nto template length, from the template of sequences in the\nfinal pool to decline with increasing S0; due to the\n\u2018capping\u2019 effect described above. Population limit Slimit\nhas no effect on mean Hamming distance for low S0; but\nincreasing Slimit results, not surprisingly, in an increased\nmean Hamming distance for large S0: For any\ncombination of S0 and Slimit; increasing m results in a\nlarger mean Hamming distance from the template for\nsequences selected randomly from the final pool.\n3.5. Stochastic variation in the results of a model\nexperiment\nIn the discussion above, the overall observed muta-\ntion rate has been expressed as a single measure over\nseveral experiments in terms of Hamming distance. The\nstochastic nature of individual substitutions has the\npotential to generate significant variation in observed\nHamming distance from the template of sequences\ndrawn from the final experimental pool, which is not\ndescribed by this single measure. Fig. 5a illustrates the\nvariation of this measure in a single MMv model\n(l0 \u00bc 0:8; S0 \u00bc 104; Slim \u00bc 1010; m \u00bc 0:010) as a boxplot\nof this distance, normalised to template sequence length,\nfor a randomly-selected bacterial coding sequence. The\ninterquartile range of this measure is compressed, with\nonly a single outlier seen. The variation in the mean\nvalue of this measure is shown in Fig. 5b for 10 runs of\nthe MMv model with the same parameters, for 10\nfurther randomly-selected bacterial coding sequences.\nThe mean values for all of these sequences lie within the\ninterquartile ranges seen for the single experiment in0:032x; Pp0:0001).\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nL. Pritchard et al. \/ Journal of Theoretical Biology 234 (2005) 497\u2013509 507Fig. 5a, although the means show significant variation\nbetween templates. These differences are explicable in\nterms of the variation in %GC content of the template\nsequences, as the MDM used (equation 8) favours\nconservation of G and C nucleotides, and this relation-\nship is demonstrated in Fig. 5c to be linear\n(y \u00bc 0:068\u0002 0:032x; Pp0:0001), mean Hamming dis-\ntance from the template (normalised to template length)\ndecreasing with increasing %GC content.4. Conclusions\nGeneralisation of the Moore and Maranas (2000)\n(MMo) model to include terms for variable amplifica-\ntion efficiency and initial template population size\nresults in a system that tends to generate sequences that\nare more similar to the template (in terms of Hamming\ndistance), by comparison with the MMo model\n(Fig. 3).\nThe introduction of a term for constant amplification\nefficiency (MMc model) implies that a reduction in\namplification efficiency reduces the mean Hamming\ndistance from the template of sequences generated\nin the experiment, independently of initial template\npopulation size (Fig. 4b). This extension is not, how-\never, sufficient to reproduce qualitatively the popu-\nlation size profile per cycle for an in vitro PCR\nexperiment, nor to provide the intuitively-expected\nbehaviour resulting from variation of initial template\npopulation size.\nIntroducing a term for amplification efficiency that\nvaries as the experiment proceeds, such that amplifica-\ntion efficiency falls as an upper limit on the sequence\npopulation is approached (MMv model) suggests that\nthe mean Hamming distance of the final population\nfrom the template is dependent on mutation rate, initial\namplification efficiency, the initial number of template\nsequences and the limit on the size of the sequence\npopulation (Figs. 4c and d). Generalisation of the MMo\nmodel to the MMv model also results in the expected\nsigmoidal profile of sequence population size, qualita-\ntively similar to those generated by RT-PCR, and\nrecreates the intuitively expected behaviour of varying\ninitial template population size.\nDirectly altering the limit on population size is\ngenerally outside the scope of practical experiment,\nwhile increasing mutation rate (e.g. by the addition of\nMn2\u00fe or mutagenic polymerase), altering dNTP bal-\nance, and reducing the number of template sequences\nare typically used to increase the sequence space\nexplored in practical experiments. The possibility of\nmanipulating amplification efficiency directly at defined\nstages in an error-prone PCR experiment is identified as\na potential mechanism for more precisely controlling the\noverall observed mutation rate per sequence.Acknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Dr Hywel Griffiths,\nClive Evans and Dr Bronwen Presswell for their advice\nand useful discussions about practical PCR, the\nBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Coun-\ncil for funding the work, and the anonymous reviewers\nfor their helpful comments and improvements to the\nmanuscript.Appendices\nThe formal proofs in these appendices are structured\nand notated to facilitate comparison with the proofs in\nMoore and Maranas (2000).Appendix A.
