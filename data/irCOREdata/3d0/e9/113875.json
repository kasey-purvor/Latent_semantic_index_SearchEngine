However, humans demonstrate a\nremarkable robustness to reverberation and many psychophysical and\nperceptual mechanisms are well documented. The precedence effect is one\nof these mechanisms; it aids our ability to localise sounds in reverberation.\nDespite this, relatively little work has been done on incorporating the\nprecedence effect into automated source separation. Furthermore, no\nwork has been carried out on adapting a precedence model to the acoustic\nconditions under test and it is unclear whether such adaptation, analogous\nto the perceptual Clifton effect, is even necessary. Hence, this study tests a\npreviously proposed binaural separation\/precedence model in real rooms\nwith a range of reverberant conditions. The precedence model inhibitory\ntime constant and inhibitory gain are varied in each room in order to\nestablish the necessity for adaptation to the acoustic conditions. The study\nconcludes that adaptation is necessary and can yield significant gains in\nseparation performance. Furthermore, it is shown that the Initial Time\nDelay Gap and the Direct-to-Reverberant Ratio are important factors\nwhen considering this adaptation.\nIndex Terms\u2014Source Separation, Reverberation, Precedence Model\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAutomated audio source separation remains an area of high re-\nsearch interest. Separation algorithms can have many applications,\nincluding front-end processing for missing data speech recognition,\nand enhancement of hearing prostheses and communication devices\nsuch as mobile phones. In many of these situations reverberation is\nlikely to be present and unfortunately it continues to be a major\nobstacle for separation algorithms, due to its corruption of many of\nthe acoustical cues that these algorithms rely on. However, numerous\nhuman psychophysical and perceptual mechanisms for suppressing\nthe effects of reverberation are well documented. One such mecha-\nnism is the precedence effect.\nThe precedence effect (for a review see [1]) is described in the\nperceptual literature as being an important mechanism for enhancing\nour ability to localise sounds in reverberant environments. Often\nreferred to as the \u201claw of the first wave front\u201d, the precedence\neffect describes an auditory mechanism which is able to give greater\nperceptual weighting to the first wave fronts of a sound\u2014the direct\nsound\u2014compared to later wave fronts arriving as reflections from\nsurrounding surfaces. However, relatively little work has been carried\nout on incorporating precedence processing into separation algorithms\nthat utilise spatial cues. To date, work in this area has been based\non that of Paloma\u00a8ki et al. [2] (see also [3]). However, as Paloma\u00a8ki\net al. note, the precedence model they utilise is somewhat simplified\nand further work could be done in order to improve its localisation\ncapabilities.\nNumerous computational precedence models have been proposed\nin the literature (see for example [4]\u2013[8]). However, only Faller\nand Merimaa [5] discuss the necessity for the algorithm to adapt\nto different acoustic conditions. Furthermore, they do not discuss\nthe computational mechanism to achieve this adaptation nor which\nacoustical factors affect it. Conversely, it is well documented that in\nhumans the precedence effect has a dynamic component\u2014the Clifton\neffect\u2014that adjusts to the acoustic conditions in which the listener\nis located [9], [10]. The necessity for a computational Clifton\u2013like\nprocessor has not been formally validated. Hence, this paper details\na study investigating the extent to which computational precedence\nmodels need to adapt to different acoustic conditions in order to\noptimise separation performance and identifies the acoustical param-\neters that affect this adaptation. The study uses an implementation of\nthe aforementioned algorithm of Paloma\u00a8ki et al. [2] as the baseline\nseparation algorithm. The inhibitory time constant and inhibitory gain\nare adjusted over a range of acoustic conditions with the aim of\noptimising the separation performance.\nThe following section summarises the baseline separation and\nprecedence algorithms. The experimental procedure is presented in\nSection III and the results are presented and discussed in Seciton IV.\nConclusions are drawn in Section V and plans for future work are\npresented in Section VI.\nII. THE SEPARATION AND PRECEDENCE ALGORITHM\nThe separation algorithm utilised in this investigation is heavily\nbased upon the aforementioned work described in [2] (note: although\nevery attempt has been made to follow the principles of this model,\ndue to implementation issues and modifications required to enable\nthe evaluation method described below, the processing utilised is\nnot identical). This section describes the pertinent aspects of the\nalgorithm; the interested reader is referred to [11] for a detailed de-\nscription of the implementation. The architecture of the experimental\nalgorithm is summarised in Fig. 1.\nThe algorithm attempts to estimate the relative strength of two\nspatially\u2013separate competing sound signals. This is achieved by cross-\ncorrelating the output of a peripheral ear model (a gammatone\nfilterbank and half-wave rectifier) to obtain the azimuths of the\nsounds. Their relative strengths are estimated from the magnitude of\nthe cross-correlation function at these azimuths. A precedence model\nis introduced to inhibit the fine structure before cross-correlation.\nThe precedence model is based on the popular paradigm suggested\nby Zurek [12], which is the basis for several similar computational\nprecedence models [2]\u2013[4], [13]. The cross-correlation C is calcu-\nlated in frequency channel i, time frame j and discrete lag \u03c4 (which\nrepresents Interaural Time Difference (ITD)) thus:\nC(i, j, \u03c4) =\n3M\u2212\u03c4\u22121\u2211\nx=0\nrL\n(\ni, (j \u2212 1)M + x+ \u03c4\n)\nrR\n(\ni, (j \u2212 1)M + x\n)\n(1)\nwhere M is the frame length in samples (10 ms) and r is the\nprecedence\u2013modelled fine structure, which is calculated for ear k\nthus:\nrk(i, n) = max\n(\nhk(i, n)\u2212G\n(\nhlp(n) \u2217 \u03b5k(i, n)\n)\n, 0\n)\n, (2)\nwhere hk is the half-wave rectified output of the gammatone fil-\nterbank at sample index n, \u03b5k is the Hilbert envelope output of\nthe gammatone filterbank, G is an inhibitory gain factor, \u2217 denotes\nconvolution and hlp is a low-pass onset-de-emphasising filter such\nthat\nhlp(n) = Ane\n\u2212n\/\u03b1p , (3)\n2Peripheral\nEar Model\nHilbert\nEnvelope\nPrecedence\nModel\nInteraural\nCross-correlation\nGrouping by\ncommon\nazimuth\nRate\nThreshold\nMonaural Pathway\nBinaural Pathway\nBinary Mask\nSpectral\nEnergy\nNormalisation\nInteraural Time\nDifference\nInteraural Level\nDifference\nResynthesis\nrk(i,n)\n\u03b5k(i,n)hk(i,n) m(i, j)\nC(i, j, \u03c4)\nFig. 1.

Following this, two additional\nchecks are performed on the mask by comparing energy values\nagainst a rate threshold and by comparing the estimated azimuth\nagainst an Interaural Level Difference (ILD) template (see [2] for\ndetails).\nIII.

The speech segments\nwere chosen to incorporate a wide range of phonemes.\nC. Binaural Room Impulse Responses\nIt was decided to use Binaural Room Impulse Responses (BRIRs)\ncaptured from real rooms rather than simulating them, due to the gen-\nerally poor subjective quality of responses calculated using acoustic\nmodels. The responses were captured at the University of Surrey from\nfour rooms (later referred to as rooms A\u2013D) of different sizes that\nexhibit a range of acoustical characteristics. A Cortex (MK.2) Head\nand Torso Simulator (HATS) and Genelec 8020A loudspeaker were\nused to capture the responses. The loudspeaker replayed sine sweeps\nthat were deconvolved to produce the impulse responses. For the\nanechoic condition (later referred to as X), a similar procedure was\nused and impulse responses were obtained using a pseudo-anechoic\napproach whereby the responses were captured in a large room and\ntruncated before the first reflection.

Variation of Precedence Parameters\nThe algorithm was evaluated in each of the acoustic conditions\nfor a range of values of the inhibitory time constant \u03b1p (see (3))\nand the inhibitory gain factor G (see (2)). With \u03b1p = 0 or G = 0,\nno inhibition will be triggered and the algorithm will simply cross\u2013\ncorrelate the input. The time regions of the input signal that will be\ninhibited will be affected by varying \u03b1p (i.e. how soon the inhibition\nstarts after an onset); the strength of inhibition increases with G.\nSetting these values is a trade-off between selecting reliable regions\nof the input signal that exhibit minimal corruption by reverberation\nB. Signals\nAs stated above, similar signals to those used in [2] were used in\nthe experiment. The target signal was a 4 second excerpt of female\nspeech taken from the European Broadcasting Union Sound Quality\nAssessment Material [15].

The Initial Time Delay Gap\n(ITDG), Direct-to-Reverberant Ratio (DRR) and reverberant decay\ntime (RT60) of each room are given in Table 1.\nD. Variation of Precedence Parameters\nThe algorithm was evaluated in each of the acoustic conditions\nfor a range of values of th inhibitory time constant \u03b1p (see (3))\na d the inh bitory gain factor G (see (2)) With \u03b1p = 0 or G = 0,\nno inhibition will be triggered and the algorithm will simply cross\u2013\ncorrelate the input. The time regions of the inpu signa that will be\ninhibited will be ffected by varying \u03b1p (i.e. how soon the inhibiti\n3starts after an onset); the strength of inhibition increases with G.\nSetting these values is a trade-off between selecting reliable regions\nof the input signal that exhibit minimal corruption by reverberation\nand maximising the proportion of the input signals that contributes\nto localisation. Specifically, the input could be highly inhibited with\na small value of \u03b1p and a high G; this would yield a signal\nthat is highly uncorrupted by reverberation, but bears little or no\nresemblance to the input and thus the separation result will be highly\ninaccurate. Additionally, increasing G will increase the likelihood of\ncross\u2013correlation values dropping below the grouping threshold \u0398c,\nresulting in the corresponding T\u2013F unit being excluded at the output.\nA range of \u03b1p values was used to encompass the range of ITDGs\nexhibited in the BRIRs: \u03b1p = [0, 25] ms. The range of G values\nused was based on the value used in [2]: G = [0, 1]. The algorithm\nwas first tested by varying \u03b1p with G = 0.5 to obtain the optimal\ntime constant for each room. Following this, given the optimal time\nconstants, G was varied to obtain the optimal value for each room.\nIt was expected that the optimal time constant would be correlated\nwith the Initial Time Delay Gap (ITDG) of the room under test,\nwhich will vary with the source and receiver positions and with the\nsize of the room, and the optimal gain would be correlated to the\nDirect-to-Reverberant Ratio (DRR), which will vary with source\u2013\nreceiver distance, with source directivity and with the total acoustic\nabsorption of the room.\nE. Choice of Metric\nTo assess the performance of the algorithm, the widely utilised\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio metric proposed by Hu and Wang [16] is\nemployed. The version proposed by Hu and Wang uses the target\nresynthesised from the Ideal Binary Mask (IBM) [17] as the ground\ntruth and is thus termed the Signal-to-Ideal-Noise Ratio:\nSINR = 10 log10\n( \u2211\nn\ns2(n)\u2211\nn\n(\ns\u02c6(n)\u2212 s(n)\n)2\n)\n(6)\nwhere s is the target signal resynthesised from the IBM and s\u02c6 is the\nestimated target signal. The IBM is calculated from the clean target\nand interferer signals thus:\nmibm(i, j) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f31 if 10 log10\n(\n\u03b4\u2032target(i, j)\n\u03b4\u2032noise(i, j)\n)\n> \u0398ibm\n0 otherwise\n(7)\nwhere \u03b4\u2032noise is the energy of the clean interfering signal, \u03b4\n\u2032\ntarget is the\nenergy of the clean target signal, \u0398ibm is a threshold value set to 0\ndB and \u03b4\u2032 is calculated in the following way:\n\u03b4\u2032(i, j) =\n(\n\u03b43.333(i, j)\n)2\n, (8)\nwhere\n\u03b4(i, j) =\n(\n\u03b5\u2032\n(\ni, (j \u2212 1)M + 1\n))0.3\n, (9)\n\u03b5\u2032(i, n) = \u03b5(i, n)\u2212 e\u2212\u03c4\u03b5\u03b5\u2032(i, n\u2212 1) (10)\nand \u03c4\u03b5 is a time constant set in samples to 8 ms. Each result reported\nlater is the mean of the SINRs calculated for the two ear signals.\nF. Summary of Experimental Conditions\nTo summarise, the algorithm is tested in all combinations of the\nfollowing parameters:\n\u2022 Three azimuthal separations\n\u2022 Three Target-to-Interferer Ratios\n\u2022 Three interferer signals\n\u2022 Four rooms and a pseudo-anechoic condition\n\u2022 A range of inhibitory time constant and gain values\n0 5 10 15 20 25\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nX AB\nC\nD\n\u03b1 p\n=IT\nDG\nITDG [ms]\nOp\ntim\nal \n\u03b1 p\n [m\ns]\n5678910\u221e\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nX\nA B\nC\nD\nDRR [dB]\nOp\ntim\nal \n G\nX A B C D\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nRoom\nSI\nNR\n [d\nB]\n \n \nOptimised\nStatic\nNo inhibition\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 2.

(b) The value of \u03b1p that achieves\noptimal performance with G = 0.5. (c) The value of G that achieves optimal\nperformance with \u03b1p optimised.\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe performance of the algorithm across the different rooms is\nplotted in Fig. 2(a). The results are averaged across all experimental\nvariables, except for the room. The plot compares the optimum\nperformance, obtained by varying \u03b1p and G, with:\n\u2022 a static condition where \u03b1p = 15 ms and G = 1 (the values\nrecommended in Paloma\u00a8ki et al.\u2019s original paper [2])\n4\u2022 an un-inhibited condition where G = 0\nThis plot clearly demonstrates the need to adapt the inhibition to\nthe acoustic conditions under test. Furthermore, given that the RT60\nincreases from left to right (see Table 1), the magnitude of perfor-\nmance gain achieved by optimising the precedence model increases\nwith RT60. For the most reverberant conditions, the optimised model\nproduces a significant gain in performance.\nIn order to implement an adaptive precedence model, it is necessary\nto identify the acoustic parameters that correlate with the optimal\nprecedence model parameters. It was hypothesised in Section III-D\nthat the optimal inhibitory time constant \u03b1p might be related to the\nITDG of the room and that the optimal inhibitory gain G might be\nrelated to the DRR of the room. These two hypotheses are tested\nin Fig. 2(b) and (c) respectively. Fig. 2(b) demonstrates a clear\ncorrelation between the ITDG of the room and the optimal inhibitory\ntime constant. Similarly, Fig. 2(c) demonstrates a strong correlation\nbetween the DRR and the optimal gain.\nThese results are in agreement with the aforementioned hypothesis.\nIn terms of the inhibitory time constant, firstly, it is clear that the\nprecedence processing must maximise the proportion of the direct\nsound that is utilised for localisation. Secondly, it is clear that the\ninhibition must start before the first reflection, since in all cases the\noptimal value of \u03b1p is less than its corresponding ITDG. In terms\nof the inhibitory gain factor, there is a clear compromise between\nmaximising the amount of input signal that contributes to localisation\nwhilst suppressing information corrupted by reverberation. Hence, the\noptimal gain is related to the DRR, i.e. the relative level of direct and\nreverberant sound.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe Clifton effect is widely observed in psychoacoustics as an\nadaptive aspect of the precedence effect. Whilst the utilisation of a\ncomputational equivalent in source separation algorithms has been\nsuggested, its necessity has not been formally validated.\nThis paper has shown that, at least for the particular separation\nalgorithm tested, the addition of non-adaptive precedence processing\nis not necessarily beneficial to the SINR achieved (rooms X, A and\nB). Furthermore, in certain acoustic conditions (room D), precedence\nprocessing can be detrimental to the system performance. In circum-\nstances where the non-adaptive precedence model is of no benefit or\nis detrimental, an adaptive model can be beneficial (rooms A, D and\nB). In circumstances where the non-adaptive precedence model is\nalready beneficial, an adaptive model can offer further improvement\n(room C).\nThe adaptation of the precedence model is dependent upon at least\ntwo acoustic parameters: ITDG and DRR. The ITDG of the room\ndetermines the point at which the inhibition should start. The prece-\ndence model should maximise the proportion of the input signal\u2019s\nduration that contributes to localisation but ensure that inhibition\nstarts before the first reflection. The DRR of the room determines\nthe appropriate amount of inhibition. The precedence model should\nsuppress information corrupted by reverberation but maximise the\nproportion of the input signal\u2019s amplitude that contributes to locali-\nsation. Optimising these two parameters can yield a significant gain\nin separation performance, especially in more reverberant conditions.\nVI. FUTURE WORK\nThis work suggests two areas for future research. Firstly, the\nnecessity for a computational Clifton\u2013like processor in other com-\nputational precedence models needs to be investigated. Secondly,\na computational Clifton\u2013like processor needs to be developed to\ndetermine optimal values for \u03b1p and G automatically based on blind\nestimation of ITDG and DRR.\nVII.
