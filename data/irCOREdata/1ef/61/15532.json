Introduction\n[2] The late early through middle Miocene saw important\nchanges in the climate system both in the marine and\nterrestrial realm The warmest interval of the Neogene, the\nso-called \u2018\u2018middle Miocene climatic optimum\u2019\u2019 [Savin et al.,\n1985; Woodruff and Savin, 1985] occurred at 17 Ma.\nVegetation is thought to have extended to high latitudes\nwith evergreen forests proliferating to 45\u0001N in North\nAmerica and 52\u0001N in Europe [Utescher et al., 2000]. Major\ndeposits of brown coal are found worldwide [Utescher et\nal., 2000; Fo\u00a8llmi et al., 2005; Holdgate et al., 2007]. This\ninterval of time is accompanied by an increase in d13C\nvalues of foraminifera, which, appropriately, has been\ntermed the \u2018\u2018middle Miocene d13C shift\u2019\u2019 [Savin et al.,\n1985; Woodruff and Savin, 1985].\n[3] The warmest interval of the Neogene at 17 Ma was\nfollowed by rapid cooling and growth of Antarctic ice\nsheets at \u000214 Ma [e.g., Flower and Kennett, 1993; Zachos\net al., 2001; Holbourn et al., 2004]. The degree of global\ncooling is evidenced by benthic oxygen isotope and Mg\/Ca\nrecords [Savin et al., 1985; Woodruff and Savin, 1985;\nBillups and Schrag, 2002; Shevenell et al., 2004], which\npoint to a dramatic (\u00025\u20138\u0001C) temperature drop at \u000214 Ma,\nice volume increase, and rapid sea level changes [Flower\nand Kennett, 1994; Miller et al., 1991; Browning et al.,\n2006]. Global cooling at \u000214 Ma has been cited as the\ndriver of increased continental aridity and expansion of C4\ngrasslands [Retallack, 2001; Jia et al., 2003], which\nreplaced the dense, warm-adapted flora dominating the\nearlier Miocene. Furthermore, brown coal deposition ceased\nduring this interval of time [Utescher et al., 2000]. Deep-sea\nd13C values decreased and returned to preexcursion values\nabout 1 million years later by \u000213 Ma.\n[4] Superimposed on the positive d13C excursion are six\ndistinct carbon isotope maxima termed \u2018\u2018CM events\u2019\u2019 by\nWoodruff and Savin [1989, 1991]. Because CM events are\nrecorded in benthic and planktic foraminiferal d13C records\nfrom all ocean basins, they are deemed global features that\nare important for mid-Miocene isotope stratigraphy [e.g.,\nLoutit, 1981; Keigwin and Shackleton, 1980; Vincent et al.,\nPALEOCEANOGRAPHY, VOL. 24, PA1209, doi:10.1029\/2008PA001605, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Zentrum fu\u00a8r Umweltwissenschaften, Universita\u00a8t des Saarlandes,\nSaarbru\u00a8cken, Germany.\n2College of Marine and Earth Studies, University of Delaware, Lewes,\nDelaware, USA.\n3Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University, Durham, UK.\n4Institut d\u2019Astrophysique et de Ge\u00b4ophysique, Universite\u00b4 de Lie`ge,\nLie`ge, Belgium.\n5UMR Ge\u00b4osyste`mes, UFR des Sciences de la Terre, Universite\u00b4 des\nSciences et Technologies de Lille, Villeneuve d\u2019Ascq, France.\n6Institut fu\u00a8r Biogeochemie und Meereschemie, Universita\u00a8t Hamburg,\nHamburg, Germany.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0883-8305\/09\/2008PA001605$12.00\nPA1209 1 of 19\n1980; Keigwin, 1987; Woodruff and Savin, 1991; Flower\nand Kennett, 1993].\n[5] Vincent and Berger [1985] proposed that high d13C\nvalues during the mid-Miocene reflect enhanced carbon\nsequestration in organic-rich sediments along the circum-\nPacific margins, an idea termed the \u2018\u2018Monterey Hypothesis.\u2019\u2019\nAccording to this hypothesis, the burial of organic carbon in\nnascent upwelling environments resulted in the drawdown of\natmospheric CO2 levels that caused subsequent global cool-\ning and the expansion of ice on Antarctica at\u000214Ma. Proxy-\nbased reconstructions and modeling suggest an increase in\nnet organic carbon flux from the oceanic to the sedimentary\nreservoir during the mid-Miocene until \u000214 Ma [Southam\nand Hay, 1981;Derry and France-Lanord, 1996]. Sediments\nfrom the Caribbean (e.g., increase in mass accumulation rates\nof pelagic carbonate; phosphogenesis [Mutti et al., 2005]),\nFlorida continental margin (phosphogenesis [Compton et al.,\n1990]), Mediterranean Sea (phosphogenesis [Jacobs et al.,\n1996; Fo\u00a8llmi et al., 2008]) and circum-Pacific margin\n(diatomaceous shales with very high organic matter content\n[Vincent and Berger, 1985]) also point to enhanced primary\nproductivity. Woodruff and Savin [1985] were the first to\npropose that relatively high foraminiferal d13C values in the\nMiocene are, at least in part, associated with higher open\nocean productivity and carbon burial in the Pacific Ocean.\n[6] However, the \u2018\u2018Monterey Hypothesis\u2019\u2019 cannot explain\nthe time lag between the onset of the positive carbon isotope\nexcursion at \u000217.5 Ma, and global cooling at \u000214 Ma, even\nif individual organic rich deposits within the Monterey\nFormation correlate with times of increased deep sea cool-\ning and positive d13C values [e.g., Flower and Kennett,\n1993]. Also, recent calculations suggest that the amount of\norganic carbon embedded in the Monterey Formation may\nnot be sufficient to impact global climate [Isaacs, 2001;\nJohn et al., 2002; Fo\u00a8llmi et al., 2005]. Furthermore,\natmospheric CO2 levels remain relatively constant and low\nthroughout the Miocene [Spivack et al., 1993; Pagani et al.,\n1999, 2000; Demicco et al., 2003]. Therefore Antarctic ice\nsheet expansion at\u000214Mamay not be related to atmospheric\nCO2 drawdown, but rather to changes in surface ocean\ncirculation [e.g., Shevenell et al., 2004] and\/or intervals of\nprolonged low Southern Hemisphere insolation [Holbourn et\nal., 2005].\n[7] Here we investigate whether or not, or the extent to\nwhich, mid-Miocene d13C records can be related to changes\nin primary marine productivity. To address this issue we\nhave constructed productivity records based on benthic\nforaminiferal accumulation rates from three sites in the\nAtlantic Ocean (Figure 1). The records span the late-early\nMiocene through late mid-Miocene (\u000219\u201311 Ma). The\nsites are from regions outside of upwelling areas dominated\nby carbonate sedimentation. In support of the foraminifer-\nderived paleoproductivity reconstructions we assess barium\nand phosphorus content, as well as calcium carbonate\naccumulation rates in order to monitor surface water car-\nbonate productivity [e.g., Murray and Peterson, 1997;\nRavelo et al., 1997; Grant and Dickens, 2002]. We use\ndissolution proxy records (percent sand size fraction, per-\ncent test fragmentation of planktonic foraminifera, and\nbenthic\/planktonic foraminiferal test ratios) to constrain\nthe effects of corrosive bottom waters on the sedimentary\nrecord. We also constructed benthic foraminiferal d13C\nrecords at each site in order to be able to directly compare\nthe productivity records to d13C variations measured in the\nsame samples. We have measured the d13C values of bulk\nsedimentary organic matter at all three sites in order to\ninvestigate possible relationships between productivity, car-\nbonate d13C, relative changes in atmospheric CO2 levels\nand terrestrial input. Last, we use a box model to test which\nFigure 1. Location of investigated ODP sites in the Atlantic Ocean.

Approach\n2.1. Site Locations\n[8] We chose Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 608 in the\nNorth Atlantic and two Ocean Drilling Program sites (Sites\n925 and 1265) located in the northwestern tropical and\nsoutheastern subtropical Atlantic, respectively (Figure 1 and\nTable 1). Site 608 is situated on the southern flank of\nKing\u2019s Trough and lies within the northern part of the\nmodern subtropical gyre [Ruddiman et al., 1987]. Site 925\nis located on Ceara Rise in the western equatorial Atlantic\nOcean [Curry et al., 1995]. Modern day surface hydrog-\nraphy here is characterized by a seasonally deep mixed\nlayer, convergence and downwelling [Peterson and\nStramma, 1991]. Site 1265 is positioned on the northern\nflank of Walvis Ridge in the subtropical South Atlantic\ntoward the western reaches of the northward flowing\nBenguela Current [Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004]. At\nall three sites, modern day primary productivity is rela-\ntively low with values of between 10 and 15 g C cm\u00032\nka\u00031 [Antoine et al., 1996] (Table 1).\n2.2. Stratigraphy and Mass Accumulation Rates\n[9] Mid-Miocene sedimentary sequences typically con-\ntain unconformities and dissolution events [Keller and\nBarron, 1983; Woodruff and Savin, 1991] that compromise\ncontinuity of proxy records. Accordingly, at Site 608, there\nis a hiatus causing a gap between \u000214.2 Ma and 13.8 Ma.\nAt Site 925, this period of time is marked by a minimum in\nlinear sedimentation rates. Additionally, while Site 925 has\nan otherwise complete and multiple cored Miocene sedi-\nmentary record, proxy records from Sites 608 and 1265\ncontain gaps at core breaks.\n[10] Among the three sites, Site 925 has the most precise\nage control because it is based on tuning physical param-\neters to astrochronology (H. Pa\u00a8like, personal communica-\ntion, 2006). For Site 608 and 1265 we rely on shipboard\nbiostratigraphic datums (Ruddiman et al. [1987] and Ship-\nboard Scientific Party [2004], respectively) and revisions\nto these provided in recent studies involving these sites\n[Wright et al., 1992, Pagani et al., 1999]. Finally, we have\nupdated the ages to the recent time scale of Gradstein et\nal. [2004], which is based on orbitally tuned control\npoints. Thus, the age models at the three sites are\ncomparable, at least at the level of the temporal resolution\nof our study (20\u201350 ka).\n[11] Mass accumulation rates (MAR) are commonly used\nto assess temporal changes in the individual sediment\ncomponents such as CaCO3, or benthic foraminifera.\nMARs, however, are not truly independent measures of\nsediment accumulation because of their dependence on\nlinear sedimentation rates (LSR). Therefore, the validity of\nMARs and thus the derived productivity proxies depends on\nage control. To calculate MARs, we linearly interpolated\nbetween age control points to derive LSR (cm ka\u00031) and\nmultiplied them with the dry bulk density (g cm\u00033). MAR is\nexpressed as gram dry sediment accumulating per cm\u00032 per\nka (g cm\u00032 ka\u00031).\n2.3. Paleoproductivity From Benthic Foraminifera\n[12] Benthic foraminiferal accumulation rates (BFAR)\nhave been used extensively as a proxy for paleoproductivity\n[Herguera and Berger, 1991; Nees, 1997; Schmiedl and\nMackensen, 1997; Yasuda, 1997; van der Zwaan et al.,\n1999; Diester-Haass et al., 2004, 2005, 2006; Diester-\nHaass and Nees, 2004, Holbourn et al., 2005]. Diester-\nHaass et al. [2005] review the derivation of paleoproduc-\ntivity estimates in g C cm\u00032 ka\u00031 from foraminiferal\naccumulation rates based on the work of Herguera [2000]\nPP \u00bc 0:4Z*BFAR0:5 \u00f01\u00de\nwhere PP stands for paleoproductivity and is related to the\nflux of organic carbon to the seafloor (g C cm\u00032 ka\u00031), Z is\nthe water depth, and BFAR is the benthic foraminiferal\naccumulation rate (tests cm\u00032 ka\u00031) derived by multiplying\nthe test counts per gram sediment with the MAR.\n[13] As discussed by Diester-Haass et al. [2005], this\napproach assumes a constant relationship between surface\nwater organic matter production and export production on\nthe one hand, and export production and the amount of\norganic carbon reaching the sediments on the other hand\n[e.g., Herguera, 2000]. Furthermore, MAR-based studies,\nsuch as the BFAR approach, are dependent on the age\nmodel. Hence, it is important to apply a multiproxy ap-\nproach that also involves other records of surface water\nproductivity that are independent of sediment accumulation\nrates such as elemental ratios.\n2.4. Carbonate Accumulation and Preservation\n[14] Changes in CaCO3 MAR (obtained by multiplying\nthe MAR by the fraction of CaCO3) can be used to assess\nchanges in surface water productivity if carbonate disso-\nlution is negligible. Because coccoliths constitute the bulk\nof inorganic carbon at our sites CaCO3-MARs provide\na measure primarily of coccolithophorid productivity\n[e.g., Berger et al., 1993; Siesser, 1995; Grant and Dickens,\n2002; Diester-Haass et al., 2005, 2006].\n[15] Dissolution limits the extent to which CaCO3 accu-\nmulation can be used as a proxy for surface water produc-\ntivity, and it also limits the extent to which the accumulation\nof geochemical sediment components reflects surface water\nproductivity [e.g., Anderson and Winckler, 2005]. Benthic\nto planktonic foraminiferal test ratios (B\/P) or the percent\nsand-sized fraction of the sediments can be used as disso-\nlution proxies as well as a fragmentation index based on the\nratio between fragmented planktonic foraminiferal tests and\nthe total amount of planktonic foraminiferal tests (whole\nTable 1.

The d13C Values of Bulk Sedimentary\nOrganic Matter\n[16] We have measured the d13C values of bulk\nsedimentary organic matter (d13Corg) at all three sites in\norder to investigate possible relationships between produc-\ntivity, carbonate d13C, relative changes in atmospheric CO2\nlevels and terrestrial input. Comparisons between d13Corg\nand d13Ccarb can be used as a qualitative measure of the CO2\nin surface waters [e.g., Hayes et al., 1989; Rau et al., 1989,\n1997; Jasper and Hayes, 1994; Francois et al., 1993].\nAlthough this proxy does not provide absolute estimates, it\noffers a relative measure of pCO2 (increase or decrease) that\ncan be directly compared against more precise paleoesti-\nmates, such as alkenones [Pagani et al., 1999, 2000]. We\nthen use the difference between the d13C values of the\nbenthic foraminifera, which we take to reflect the d13C of\ndissolved inorganic carbon, and the bulk d13Corg value of\nsedimentary organic matter as an indicator of carbon isotope\nfractionation and thus atmospheric pCO2 [Rau et al., 1997].\n2.6. Elemental Ratios as Paleoproductivity Proxies\n[17] Independent evidence for changes in productivity\ncomes from ratios of barium and phosphorus as \u2018\u2018biogenic\u2019\u2019\nto aluminum or titanium as \u2018\u2018detrital\u2019\u2019 elements. Numerous\nstudies have used this approach to assess changes in\npaleoproductivity in the Pleistocene [Averyt and Paytan,\n2004], and Miocene [e.g., Weedon and Shackleton, 1997;\nGrant and Dickens, 2002]. Ba\/Al ratios in excess of those in\nregional detrital inputs are often used for qualitative\n[Schmitz, 1987] or quantitative reconstructions of the\norganic carbon export of the seafloor [e.g., Francois et\nal., 1995; Dymond et al., 1992; Eagle et al., 2003; Reitz et\nal., 2004]. The approach hinges on assumptions related to\nthe source of excess Ba being marine biogenic barite and the\nregional detrital Ba\/Al (or Ba\/Ti) background ratio being\nknown and relatively constant through time [Averyt and\nPaytan, 2004; Anderson and Winckler, 2005].\n[18] Another commonly used productivity indicator is the\nratio of P\/Al. It provides information on the availability of\nP from continental weathering, or the decoupling of\nP availability from weathering fluxes because of changes\nin ocean circulation and chemistry [e.g., Delaney and Boyle,\n1987; Filippelli and Delaney, 1995; Filippelli, 1997].\nAgain, this approach assumes that the flux of Al (or Ti)\nremained constant through time.\n2.7. Numerical Box Modeling\n[19] To explore the magnitudes of changes in marine and\nterrestrial carbon pools and their isotope ratios in the global\ncarbon cycle to be expected from the middle Miocene\nisotope shift, we adapted a numerical box model to permit\nsensitivity studies. Isaacs [2001] and Fo\u00a8llmi et al. [2005]\nhave shown that the \u00021% d13C excursion cannot be\nexplained entirely by an increase in marine organic carbon\nburial from circum-Pacific Monterey type sediments. Here\nwe use a box model of the global carbon cycle to evaluate\nthe effect of terrestrial carbon burial on the global carbon\ncycle and the oceanic d13C signature. These sensitivity tests\nwere conducted with a model updated from the version of\nGrard et al. [2005]; details are provided in Appendix A.\n3. Analytical Methods\n[20] Samples (20 cm3) were split for geochemical and\nmicropaleontological analyses. For sedimentological-micro-\npaleontological studies 10 cm3 were oven-dried at 60\u0001C,\nweighed, washed through 40 and 63 mm sieves, dried and\ndry sieved into subfractions (63\u2013125, 125\u2013250, 250\u2013500,\n>500 mm). In each fraction 800 grains (if present) were\ncounted and various biogenic, clastic and authigenic\ncomponents differentiated to yield percentage composition\nof the sand fraction. The numbers of benthic foraminifera in\nthe three fractions were summed up and divided by the\nweight of the total analyzed sample to give the number of\nbenthic foraminifera per gram of total sediment.\n[21] Carbon isotope analyses were conducted on 1\u20135\nCibicidoides wuellerstorfi and C. mundulus picked from\nthe > 255 mm fraction. At Sites 608 and 1265 we note a\nsmall (0.2%) difference between the d13C values of C.\nwuellerstorfi and C. mundulus. We subtract 0.2% from the\nC. wuellerstorfi d13C values to bring them in line with C.\nmundulus, which dominate the downcore records. All\nsamples were sonicated in deionized water to remove\nadhering sediment and oven-dried for at least 24 h prior to\nisotopic analysis. Analyses were performed at the Uni-\nversity of Delaware using a GVI IsoPrime equipped with a\nMultiprep peripheral for the automated reaction of individ-\nual samples with phosphoric acid (at 90\u0001C). Using NBS-19\nand an in-house standard (Carrara Marble) the precision for\nd13C and d18O values is better than 0.05% and 0.08%,\nrespectively, in the size range of the samples (20\u2013200 mg).\n[22] Stable isotope analysis of bulk sedimentary organic\nmatter was performed on decarbonated samples. One cm3 of\nthe sample was placed in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and\nreacted with 3 mol L\u00031 HCl overnight. Because of the\nrelatively high amount of carbonate in these sediments,\nfresh HCl was added the following day and if no efferves-\ncence occurred the samples were rinsed until neutrality was\nobtained. No samples reacted after the overnight treatment.\nSamples were then oven-dried at 60\u0001C for at least 24 h prior\nto isotopic analysis. Analyses were performed at McMaster\nUniversity using a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP\nequipped with a Costech elemental analyzer for combustion\nof the sediment samples. Up to 8 international and internal\nstandards were analyzed during the generation of these\nisotopic data and precision of d13Corg was 0.1%. Because\nof the low concentration of organic matter within these\nsediments, isotopic analysis was performed without dilution\nand sample sizes ranged between 1.2 to 1.5 mg in order to\nproduce an intensity >1000 mV. Analytical reproducibility\nof replicate samples was on average 0.2%.\n[23] Total inorganic carbon (TIC) and major element\ncomposition were determined on the other half of the bulk\nsediments after freeze drying and grinding in an agate\nmortar. Total carbon was determined on all samples by\ncombustion at 1200\u0001C and detection with a thermal con-\nductivity detector (NA 1500 Carlo Erba). TIC was deter-\nmined coulometrically after acidification of weighed sample\nPA1209 DIESTER-HAASS ET AL.: MID-MIOCENE PALEOPRODUCTIVITY\n4 of 19\nPA1209\nsplits with 1N HCl in a Juwe Coulomat 702 instrument.\nConcentrations of aluminum, phosphorus and barium were\nanalyzed on fused (600 mg of sample diluted with 3600 mg\nof lithium tetraborate) discs in an automated X-ray fluores-\ncence spectrometer MagixPRO (Panalytical) that is\nequipped with a Rh anode. Loss on ignition was determined\nat 110\u0001C and at 1000\u0001C. Concentrations of major and trace\nelements were calculated on the basis of a calibration\nagainst international standards. Ratios of Ba\/Al and P\/Al\nwere calculated as weight ratios of the elements barium,\naluminum, and phosphorus in the samples.\n4. Results\n4.1. Site 608\n[24] The mid-Miocene d13C shift is well expressed in the\nNorth Atlantic benthic foraminiferal d13C values, which\nbegin to increase at \u000217.5 Ma, remain high until 13.5 Ma,\nand decrease thereafter (Figure 2a). We recognize several\nwell-defined smaller d13C maxima superimposed on the\nlong-term trend (Figure 2a). These individual d13C maxima\n(\u000215.7 Ma, 15.2 Ma, 14.7 Ma, and 13.5 Ma) correspond to\nCM 3, CM 4, CM 5, and CM 6, which are generally\nrecognized in Miocene marine sections [Woodruff and\nSavin, 1991] providing a check on the comparability of the\nage models among the sites.\n[25] Benthic foraminiferal d18O values are relatively low\nuntil \u000214.4 Ma, increase between 14.4 Ma and 13.4 Ma,\nand remain high thereafter (Figure 2b). A hiatus leaves a\n\u00020.4 Ma gap in the record (14.2\u201313.8 Ma) so that the d18O\nmaximum outlining the major step in ice volume increase as\nAntarctic ice sheets expand during the mid-Miocene is not\npresent (Figure 2b). The beginning of increasing d18O\nvalues at 14.4 Ma predates the timing of the increase seen in\norbitally tuned records where it occurs at \u000214.0\u201313.9 Ma\n[Holbourn et al., 2005]. At this scale, the discrepancy likely\nreflects uncertainties associated with relatively coarsely\nspaced biostratigraphic age control points.\n[26] There is little agreement in the long-term trends among\nthe proxy records that would suggest a relationship between\nproductivity and the foraminiferal d13C records. There is no\napparent association between the mid-Miocene d13C max-\nimum and productivity. BFAR derived paleoproductivity\nincreases gradually from 18 Ma to 12 Ma (Figure 2c), a\ntrend is also seen in the CaCO3 MAR (Figure 2i) and that\nmay be linked to an overall increase in LSR (Figure 2k).\nThe d13Corg record (Figure 2d) displays a trend toward\nincreasing values beginning at \u000217.5 Ma, remains relatively\nhigh until \u000213.8 Ma, after which point it decreases toward a\nminimum at \u000213.3 Ma. Thus, the overall character of this\ntrend is similar to the benthic foraminiferal d13C record\n(Figure 2a). The similarity of these carbon isotope records is\nhighlighted by their difference (D13C, Figure 2e), which\nremains relatively constant over the long term.\n[27] Linear sedimentation rates (Figure 2k), as well as\nCaCO3 accumulation (Figure 2i) increase gradually from\n18 to 12 Ma and the long-term trend in the paleoproductivity\nrecord may at least in part reflect the overall increase in\nMARs. The percent CaCO3 (Figure 2j), a measure that is\nindependent of age control, shows a parallel increase sug-\ngesting that the overall increase in sediment accumulation\nmay have been brought about by relatively enhanced car-\nbonate deposition\/preservation. There are no marked\nchanges in the long-term trend of the dissolution indices\n(B\/P ratio and % fragmentation), but the timing of smaller-\nscale variations agrees well (Figures 2f and 2g, respectively).\n4.2. Site 925\n[28] In the tropical Atlantic, benthic foraminiferal d13C\nvalues also display the well-defined mid-Miocene d13C\nmaximum (Figure 3a). Two individual d13C maxima clearly\nstand out above the background, and the timing agrees with\nthe timing of CM 5 at 14.7 Ma and CM 6 at 13.5 Ma as\nobserved at Site 608 (Figure 2a). The interval corresponding\nto CM 3 (15.8 Ma) is characterized by generally high d13C\nvalues and the excursion is not well defined, possibly\nbecause of a gap in the d13C record just preceding the event.\nCM 4 is absent and d13C values remain constant until\ndecreasing just prior to CM 5.\n[29] Benthic foraminiferal d18O values follow the global\nmiddle Miocene pattern with relatively low values until\n\u000214 Ma, a rapid increase between 14.0 Ma and 13.8 Ma,\nand relatively high values thereafter (Figure 3b). The rapid\nd18O increase between 14.0 and 13.8 Ma is entirely\nconsistent with other orbitally tuned d18O records\n[Holbourn et al., 2005].\n[30] As shown at Site 608, the paleoproductivity and benthic\nforaminiferal d13C records do not show any similarity over\nthe long term (Figure 3c). Paleoproductivity fluctuated\nabout a constant mean until 14.4 Ma, where it displays a\npronounced minimum between 14.4 Ma and 13.8 Ma and\nincreases thereafter, a pattern tracking the LSR (Figure 3k).\n[31] The long-term component of the d13Corg values does\nnot follow the benthic foraminiferal d13C values as observed\nat Site 608 (Figure 3d). Instead, the d13Corg curve fluctuates\nwidely about a long-term mean of approximately \u000324%\nbefore \u000215 Ma, and at approximately \u000322% after 13.5 Ma.\nBecause foraminiferal d13C values decrease after 13.5 Ma,\nwhile the d13Corg values increase, the D\n13C curve shows a\npronounced (4%) increase between 13.5 and 12.5 Ma\n(Figure 3e). This would be consistent with a change in\npCO2, but is, perhaps more likely, due to the vicinity of the\nAmazon River [Hoorn et al., 1995] and the type of organic\nmatter preserved.\n[32] Linear sedimentation rates decrease slightly between\n18 and 11 Ma, but there are relatively large variations. For\nexample, a prolonged maximum is centered at 15 Ma and an\nextreme minimum occurs between 14.4 and 13.8 Ma\n(Figure 3k). These maxima and minima transmit into the\nMAR derived records (CaCO3 accumulation, Figure 3i and\npaleoproductivity, Figure 3c). CaCO3 decreases by about 30%\nbetween 14.8 and 13.8 Ma (Figure 3j). Dissolution indices\n(Figures 3f and 3g) do not show any change during this portion\nof the record suggesting increasingly less carbonate produc-\ntion across the interval of major Antarctic ice expansion.\n4.3. Site 1265\n[33] In the southeastern subtropical Atlantic, benthic\nforaminiferal d13C values display the overall middle\nMiocene d13C maximum, but individual CM events are\nnot readily apparent (Figure 4a). Although there is a core\nPA1209 DIESTER-HAASS ET AL.: MID-MIOCENE PALEOPRODUCTIVITY\n5 of 19\nPA1209\nbreak spanning the interval that would contain CM 3, the\nd13C values are constant between 15.4 (\u0002CM 4) and\n14.6 Ma (\u0002CM 5), decrease rapidly until 14.0 Ma, and\ndisplay a minor maximum at 13.2 Ma, and again at\n12.6 Ma.\n[34] The long-term trend in the d18O record mirrors the\nd13C record with a long minimum between 17 Ma and\n14 Ma when d13C values are high. The d18O values decrease\nrapidly between 14.2 Ma and 14.0 Ma, suggesting that\nthe ages may be \u00020.2 Ma too old. For example, shifting\nFigure 2. Results from North Atlantic Site 608.

CM 5 and CM 6 would\nbe missing still as there are no variations in the d13C record\nnear these events.\n[35] Similarly to the other two sites, the paleoproductivity\nrecord does not show an overall trend during the middle\nFigure 3.

After 15.5 Ma when benthic\nforaminiferal d13C values decrease, d13Corg remains con-\nstant. As a result, the Dd13C curve is relatively invariant\nFigure 4. Results from South Atlantic Site 1265.

There is an\ninterval of relatively high variability in the d13Corg record\nbetween \u000214.5\u201314 Ma that corresponds to increased\nproductivity, decreasing benthic foraminiferal d13C values,\nincreasing d18O values, and hence to the major step in mid-\nMiocene Antarctic ice sheet growth.\n[37] Linear sedimentation rates are very low (<1 cm\nka\u00031), and decrease further throughout the interval investi-\ngated (Figure 4k). There is a brief increase in LSR at\n\u000214 Ma concurrent with the d18O maximum (Figure 4b).\nThe material that does accumulate is almost exclusively\nCaCO3 (Figure 4j). The percent fragments (Figure 4g) as\nwell as the B\/P ratio (Figure 4f) increase after 15 Ma when\nthe percent sand fraction decreases (Figure 4h) suggesting\nincreasingly more corrosive bottom waters. The effect of\ndissolution can also be seen in a slight decrease of the %\nCaCO3 after 14 Ma (Figure 4j).\n4.4. Elemental Ratios\n[38] None of the three locations experienced an obvious\nenrichment of Ba or P2O5 over the detrital background\n(Figure 5). Ba concentrations are very low at Site 1265, but\nconsiderably higher at 608 and 925 (Figure 5a). This\ndifference agrees with the generally low modern day pro-\nductivity (Table 1) and apparently low Miocene paleopro-\nductivity at Site 1265 (Figure 4c). Downcore, the Ba\/Al2O3\nratios are inversely correlated to Al2O3 mass accumulation\nrates (not shown), a fact that excludes more detailed\ninterpretation of Ba as a productivity proxy. Concentration\nof P2O5 is very low at all sites and there is no obvious\nenrichment over Al2O3 (Figure 5b). Consistent with Ba,\nlowest P2O5 concentrations are recorded at Site 1265 and\nagree with the comparatively nutrient poor environment\nin the modern and paleo-ocean. At all sites, the TiO2\nand Al2O3 weight percentages are linearly correlated\n(Figure 5c), reflecting a relatively constant sediment source\nat all sites; higher TiO2 and Al2O3 concentrations at Site\n925 as compared to the other sites underline the proximity\nof the Amazon River. The apparent lack of changes in\nnutrient or geochemical productivity proxies is consistent\nwith the lack of long-term changes in paleoproductivity\napparent in the other proxies.\n[39] Auxiliary material is available electronically at World\nData Center for Paleoclimatology, National Geophysical\nData Center, NOAA, Boulder, Colorado, USA.1\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Benthic Foraminiferal d13C Records and\nProductivity\n[40] In summary, the Atlantic sites do not show a change\nin benthic foraminifer-derived and geochemically derived\npaleoproductivity that would correspond to the overall,\nlong-term maximum in the mid-Miocene benthic foraminif-\neral d13C records (Figure 6). The increase in productivity at\nSite 608 may be related to an age model\u2013dependent\nincrease in linear sedimentation rates, and it is thus\nambiguous to what extent the pattern reflects the environ-\nmental signal. At Sites 608 and 925, individual d13C\nmaxima superimposed on the long-term trend occur at the\nsame time, reflect Miocene CM events, and suggest that the\nrecords have a consistent chronology. Decreasing the ages at\nSite 1265 by 0.2 Ma, as justified on the basis of the d18O\nrecord, would align individual d13C with CM 3 and CM 4,\nhowever the d13C maxima associated with CM 5 and CM 6\nare missing. At this site, we observe a marked increase in\nproductivity at 14 Ma, coincident with the decrease in d13C\nand increase in benthic foraminiferal d18O values reflecting\nAntarctic ice sheet expansion. We suggest that at Site 1265\nthe data may reflect the importance of regional processes on\nthe d13C record and paleoproductivity.\n[41] These data do not provide evidence for a link\nbetween the mid-Miocene d13C maximum and changes in\nmarine primary productivity in the Atlantic Ocean. It may\nbe that the long-term d13C trend of bottom waters is\nprimarily controlled by processes operating on the global\nscale, while the individual productivity records reflect\nregional conditions that have little effect on bottom water\nd13C values. Our mid-Miocene time interval predates the\nevolution of Atlantic-Pacific d13C gradients associated with\nthe formation of deep waters in the North Atlantic [Wright\net al., 1992; Poore et al., 2006]. Thus, deep water\ncirculation changes and associated variations in the d13C\nof benthic foraminifera cannot explain the observed\nrelationship (or rather lack thereof).\n[42] Our data also highlight that the beginning of the d13C\nexcursion at about 17 Ma is not related to climatic changes,\nat least as recorded by the d18O values of benthic\nforaminifera, which do not indicate either a warming or a\ncooling at this time. This does not rule out that the end of\nthe d13C shift is not linked in some way to the expansion of\nAntarctic ice at \u000214 Ma. The d13C records return to\npreexcursion values at the end of the final of the CM events\n(CM 6) by about 13 Ma after cooling (i. e., the increase in\nd18O of benthic foraminifera) has reached a maximum.\nThese observations attest to the complexity of the factors\nthat can determine oceanic d13C values, which we further\nexplore using a numerical model.\n5.2. Bulk Sediment d13C Records and pCO2\n[43] In this study we have attempted to address the\nquestion whether atmospheric pCO2 showed changes over\nthis climate transition using the foraminiferal and bulk\nsedimentary organic matter d13C records. These paired\nrecords show broadly similar changes over the mid-\nMiocene, which implies that the positive d13C excursions\nduring the mid-Miocene affected the entire oceanic carbon\nreservoir. This is particularly evident in the delta-delta\n(D13C = d13Ccarb \u0003 d13Corg) curves (Figures 2e, 3e, and 4e),\nwhich are largely parallel and do not show any major shift\nin the isotopic fractionation between the carbonate and\norganic carbon reservoirs. Our data agree with Miocene\npCO2 reconstructions from haptophyte alkenone records\n[Pagani et al., 1999, 2000; Henderiks and Pagani, 2007],\nboron isotopes and carbonate mineralogy [Demicco et al.,\n2003] supporting that atmospheric CO2 levels did not\nchange significantly over the investigated interval of time.1Auxiliary materials are available at http:\/\/www.ngdc.noaa.gov\/paleo\/\nindex.html.\nPA1209 DIESTER-HAASS ET AL.: MID-MIOCENE PALEOPRODUCTIVITY\n9 of 19\nPA1209\nFigure 5.

Numerical Sensitivity Tests\n[44] We use a box-modeling approach to assess marine\nproductivity, d13C records, and global carbon cycling. The\naim of this modeling effort is to analyze the factors that may\nexplain the positive d13C excursion of the deep ocean that\noccurred between 19 Ma and 13 Ma. Specifically, the\nisotopic effects of the following factors will be analyzed:\n(1) a warming of the surface ocean pool associated with the\nmid-Miocene climatic optimum; (2) possible changes in\nocean productivity and\/or organic carbon preservation in the\nwater column or sediment, that may induce an increase in\nthe marine organic carbon burial flux; and (3) enhanced\ndeposition of organic carbon from the continents.\n6.1. Surface Ocean Warming\n[45] The global d18O curve [Zachos et al., 2001], as well\nas continental paleovegetation data [e.g., Mosbrugger et al.,\n2005], clearly mark the middle Miocene as a \u2018\u2018climatic\noptimum.\u2019\u2019 A potential rise of oceanic surface temperatures\nassociated with generally warmer conditions may have\naltered the distribution of carbon isotopes among the\ncarbonate species in the surface ocean [Freeman and\nHayes, 1992] and hence the isotopic composition of the\nFigure 6.

Moreover, the warming can also be expected\nto affect the CO2 solubility, which can modify the isotopic\nfractionation of marine organisms and, thus again, the\nisotopic composition of the transferred carbon. To test the\ninfluence of warmer surface temperature on the d13C of\nthe deep ocean carbon reservoir, the surface ocean\ntemperature in the model was increased abruptly by 2\u0001C\nat 19 Ma. Note that this surface warming was not applied on\nthe continents for the calculation of weathering rates, since\ncontinental temperatures are involved in the silicate weath-\nering feedback and, thus, cannot be imposed externally in\nthe model. Therefore, the change in continental tempera-\ntures may not be consistent with the change in ocean surface\ntemperature in this sensitivity test, but the test should reveal\nthe impact of the surface ocean warming on deep ocean\nd13C values. The results of this test are illustrated in Figure 7\n(run 1) and show that surface ocean warming produces a\ndecrease of the isotopic compositions of the surface and\ndeep ocean carbon reservoirs by only 0.1%, which is much\nsmaller and of the opposite direction than the observed\namplitude of the deep d13C excursion during the mid-\nMiocene climatic optimum. We rule out that an increase in\nsea surface temperatures affected the mid-Miocene deep\nocean carbon isotopic excursion.\n6.2. Marine Productivity and Organic Matter\nPreservation\n[46] Although our proxy data do not indicate that marine\nproductivity played a significant role in increasing the mid-\nMiocene carbon isotope values, we use the box model to\nnumerically demonstrate that it is not possible to reproduce\nthe isotope record by changing marine productivity (Figure 7,\nruns 2 and 3). We test the effect of a 50% progressive\nincrease in global productivity over a 3 Ma long time\ninterval. Primary productivity increase is artificially stimu-\nlated by increasing the input of phosphorus to the ocean. We\nconduct two simulations: In run 2 organic matter preserva-\ntion is kept constant so that organic carbon burial increases\nin the ocean as productivity increases. In run 3, organic\nmatter preservation is reduced in order to keep constant the\noceanic organic carbon storage. In both runs, model pro-\nductivity is increased from 2.5 \u0001 1012 mol C a\u00031 to 3.77 \u0001\n1012 mol C a\u00031 (a 50% increase) keeping continental\norganic carbon deposition constant at its reference value\nof 2.3 \u0001 1012 mol C a\u00031. The results of these two experi-\nments indicate that none produces the observed \u00021% d13C\nincrease in the deep ocean (Figure 7). In run 2 (constant\norganic matter preservation), the effect of the productivity\nincrease is to enhance the d13C gradient between the surface\nand deep ocean. The d13C value of deep ocean decreases by\n0.26%, while the surface value increases by \u00021%. In run 3,\n(reduced organic matter preservation to keep organic carbon\nburial constant), we observe a large decrease (0.8%) in the\ndeep ocean, while surface isotopic d13C values remain\nconstant (Figure 7).\n[47] To assess the possible role of marine biology in the\nobserved rise of the deep ocean d13C values, other\ncombinations of ocean productivity and organic matter\npreservation (or organic carbon burial flux) than those\nillustrated in Figure 7 must be explored. As illustrated in\nFigure 8, several combinations of productivity and organic\nFigure 7. Variations of surface and deep ocean d13C in four different model scenarios starting from an\nearly Miocene (19 Ma) preperturbation steady state. The deep ocean signal is compared to the data given\nby Zachos et al. [2001]. Run 1, step increase of ocean surface temperature by 2\u0001C at 19 Ma; run 2, 50%\n(progressive) increase of ocean biological productivity between 19 and 16 Ma with constant organic\ncarbon preservation in sediments; run 3, 50% (progressive) increase of ocean biological productivity\nbetween 19 and 16 Ma with reduced organic carbon preservation in sediments, so that organic carbon\nburial is kept constant; and run 4, continental organic matter deposition increases linearly from 2.3 \u0001\n1012 mol C a\u00031 to 3.3 \u0001 1012 mol C a\u00031 between 19 and 16 Ma.\nPA1209 DIESTER-HAASS ET AL.: MID-MIOCENE PALEOPRODUCTIVITY\n12 of 19\nPA1209\ncarbon burial changes may lead to the observed change in\nd13C values. In Figure 8, the preperturbation state is\nrepresented by the black dot on the 0.8% deep ocean d13C\nisoline. This state corresponds to the 19 Ma preperturbation\nstate in Figure 7. A perturbation in ocean productivity (x axis)\nand\/or organic carbon burial (y axis) is applied over\n3 million years to reach a new steady state at 16\u201314 Ma,\nsimilarly to the experiments shown in Figure 7. For the\nmodel to be consistent with Zachos et al.\u2019s [2001] data, the\nmodel must reach the 1.7% deep ocean d13C isoline,\nfollowing for instance arrows A or B. However, arrow A\nwould result in a deepening of the model CCD, while data\nsuggest a shallower CCD at 16 Ma by \u0002200\u2013400 m [van\nAndel, 1975; Opdyke and Wilkinson, 1988] compared with\nthe 19 Ma state. On the other hand, arrow B may be more\nconsistent with the CCD change, but in this case atmo-\nspheric CO2 reaches levels lower than 100 ppmv at 16 Ma,\nwhich is lower than pCO2 reconstructions based on\nalkenone 13C isotopic fractionation [Pagani et al., 2000;\nHenderiks and Pagani, 2007, 2008], and boron isotopes\n[Demicco et al., 2003]. Paths between arrows A and B are\nprobably the most consistent with the data, although the\ndecrease in atmospheric pCO2 remains too large. However,\npossible reorganizations of surface to deep carbonate\nproduction\/deposition (e.g., through an increase in coral\nreef formation or an increase of the aragonite:calcite ratio of\ncarbonate productivity) between 19 and 16 Ma may result in\na lowering of the CCD, so that path A may become more\nconsistent with the data. Although such reorganizations are\npossible, we feel that path A (as well as intermediate A-B\npaths) remains unlikely, because our data indicate no change\n(at Sites 925, 1265) or possibly a slight regional increase in\nproductivity (at Site 608). For these reasons we believe that\nany purely marine scenario is not a likely explanation for\nFigure 8. Model sensitivity to ocean productivity and\/or ocean organic carbon deposition changes. The\nblack circle represents the Miocene preperturbation state (19 Ma) from which the system evolves in\nresponse to a progressive change in productivity and\/or organic carbon preservation over a 3 Ma time\nspan (i.e., between 19 and 16 Ma). The isolines show the values of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2), calcite\ncompensation depth (CCD), and deep ocean d13C in the steady state reached after the perturbation. The\npath followed by the model representative point must reach the 1.7% deep ocean d13C isoline (paths A\nand B) for the evolution to be consistent with the data given by Zachos et al. [2001].\nPA1209 DIESTER-HAASS ET AL.: MID-MIOCENE PALEOPRODUCTIVITY\n13 of 19\nPA1209\nthe mid-Miocene positive excursion in deep ocean d13C.\nInstead, the explanation for this excursion must be searched\nfor on the continents.\n6.3. Terrestrial Carbon Storage and pCO2atm\n[48] Enhanced organic carbon storage on land should result\nin an overall increase of the d13C of the Earth\u2019s surface\nsystem (including the ocean, the atmosphere and the terrestrial\nbiosphere), and thus also the d13C values of the deep ocean.\nThe importance of the response may depend on the magnitude\nof the atmospheric pCO2 decrease, associated with the\nenhanced organic carbon sequestration, because 13C fractiona-\ntion of marine photosynthetic organisms is reduced at lower\nCO2 levels. This fractionation effect is implemented in the\nmodel and results in a negative feedback, which tends to\ndampen the d13C fluctuation of the system.\n[49] As illustrated in Figure 7 (run 4), the magnitude of\nthe mid-Miocene positive excursion in deep ocean d13C\nrecords can be accounted for in our model by increasing\nlinearly the organic C storage on land from the preperturba-\ntion value (2.3 \u0001 1012 mol C a\u00031) to 3.3 \u0001 1012 mol C a\u00031\nover a period of 3 Ma, which corresponds to an additional\naccumulation of 1.5 \u0001 1018 mol C. Oceanic organic carbon\nburial and productivity remain constant. This continental\ncarbon sequestration leads to an increase of the deep ocean\nd13C from 0.8% to 1.7% (Figure 7, run 4), which agrees\nwith the global d13C record [Zachos et al., 2001]. This\nimposed additional sequestration leads to a decrease in\natmospheric pCO2 from 264 ppmv to 135 ppmv, which is\nlower by \u000250 ppmv than the minimum suggested by proxy\nreconstructions [Henderiks and Pagani, 2007]. Proxy-based\nestimates more in line with the model results are the\nminimum of 176 ppmv at 16.2 Ma according to\nphytoplankton 13C isotopic fractionation data of Pagani et\nal. [2000] (for this period, change in cell size does not alter\nsignificantly the pCO2 estimates according to Henderiks\nand Pagani [2008]), and the minimum of 126 ppmv at\n15 Ma and 101 ppmv at 14.7 Ma according to boron\nisotopic data of Demicco et al. [2003]. This modeled change\nis accompanied by a small upward shift (360 m) of the\nmodel calcite compensation depth (CCD), a trend which is\nfully consistent with van Andel\u2019s [1975] data. We note that\nneither the alkenone based proxy reconstructions nor the\nmodel output support the CO2 estimates derived from\nstomatal frequency data of Ku\u00a8rschner et al. [2008], who\nindicate a p CO2 of 500 ppmv during the mid-Miocene\nclimate optimum.\n[50] Our simulation thus supports the hypothesis of an\nincrease in continental organic carbon sequestration. This\nterrestrial sink appears much more likely than any marine-\nbased sink (see Figure 8), because the associated change in\ndeep ocean d13C values and CCD are both consistent with\nthe available data, while the modeled pCO2 drop is\nsignificantly reduced with respect to the marine-based\nscenarios. Indeed, compared to the sequestration of marine\norganic carbon, the burial of terrestrial organic carbon has\nthe advantage to limit the decrease in the atmospheric pCO2\nassociated with the enhanced carbon sequestration, because\nterrestrial C3 plants have significantly lower d\n13C signatures\nthan marine organisms. The continental d13C signature may\nhave even become more negative if, as can be expected, the\ncontinents became wetter during the mid-Miocene warming.\nIn such a case, the amount of sequestered continental\norganic carbon required to explain the deep ocean isotopic\nshift would have been lower and so the decrease in\natmospheric pCO2 would also need to be smaller.\n[51] It must be stressed that the CO2 drop in the model is\nthe direct consequence of the increased organic carbon\ndeposition, which results from the constraint to follow the\ndeep ocean d13C rise in the model. Hence, the rise of pCO2\nfrom \u0002300 ppmv at 20 Ma to almost 500 ppmv at 16 Ma\nsuggested by the stomatal frequency data of Ku\u00a8rschner et\nal. [2008] is difficult to reconcile with the observed \u00020.9%\npositive excursion during the same time interval of the deep\nocean d13C, which is a well-established variation of a\ncarbon cycle proxy. Such an inconsistency of pCO2 with a\ncarbon cycle proxy is probably more difficult to resolve\nthan the apparently small effect of pCO2 on climate, which\nwas invoked by earlier studies [Pagani et al., 1999, 2000],\nas climate is affected by other forcing factors than CO2\n(other greenhouse gases, paleogeography and associated\nimpacts of ocean circulation).\n[52] It might be possible, however, to limit the model CO2\ndrop associated with the deposition of organic carbon by\ntwo mechanisms. First, the calculated CO2 change depends\non the dependence on pCO2 of the\n13C fractionation of\nmarine (and terrestrial) photosynthesis adopted in the\nmodel. The slope of this relationship is not well known,\nwhile it may significantly affect the magnitude of the CO2\ndrop. Second, our model assumes that CO2 emission from\nvolcanism remained constant between 19 and 16 Ma. This is\nbased on Cogne\u00b4 and Humler\u2019s [2006] reconstruction of\nseafloor spreading rates, which show very small variations\nduring this period. However, the volcanism associated with\nColumbia River Basalts (CRB) is not taken into account in\nthis reconstruction, while Ku\u00a8rschner et al. [2008] invoke it\nas a possible explanation for the mid-Miocene rise in CO2\nreconstructed from their stomatal frequency data. Might\nsuch an additional release of CO2 by volcanism counter-\nbalance for the sink associated with organic deposition?\n[53] As a final thought, we have tested the impact of CRB\nin our model (see Appendix A for model details). The\nresults show an atmospheric CO2 level raised by only\n9 ppmv during the eruption phase compared to the reference\nsimulation (run 4) without CRB. After the eruption, when\nthe emission of CRB CO2 has ceased, atmospheric CO2\nstabilizes at 134 ppmv, i.e., 1 ppmv below the reference\nsimulation. Consequently, the overall impact of CRB\nappears to be quite small.\n[54] In summary, our model indicates that the increase of\ndeep ocean d13C between 19 and 16 Ma implies that some\n1.5 \u0001 1018 moles of organic carbon must have been\nsequestered from the ocean-atmosphere system during this\ntime interval. The consequence is a drop in atmospheric\npCO2, which appears exaggerated with respect to the most\nrecent CO2 reconstructions from geochemical data that\nsuggest little change. An additional source of CO2 with a\n13C isotopic signature close to (or above) that of the ocean,\nas for instance volcanism, is needed to reduce this\natmospheric CO2 drop and make the model more consistent\nPA1209 DIESTER-HAASS ET AL.: MID-MIOCENE PALEOPRODUCTIVITY\n14 of 19\nPA1209\nwith the proxies. The amount of CO2 emitted from CRB is\ntoo low to significantly reduce the pCO2 drop, because of\nthe small volume of basalts involved and to the fact that\nbasalt weathering consumes at least part of the emitted CO2.\nTherefore, it is continental organic carbon sequestration that\ncan best explain the observed benthic foraminiferal d13C\nmaximum, because (1) this is more consistent with the\nabsence of any marked long-term trend in marine\nproductivity evidenced by our data; (2) the 13C fractionation\nof photosynthesis is larger in the terrestrial than in the\nmarine realm, implying that the modeled atmospheric pCO2\ndrop is lower and thus easier to reconcile with the CO2\nproxies; and (3) continental sequestration is consistent with\nthe upward CCD shift observed in the ocean. We highlight\nthat relatively large uncertainties surround the magnitude of\nthe pCO2 drop and the CCD shift, which depend on the\nkinetic rate constants (temperature and pCO2 dependence)\nused for weathering, and the slope of the relationship\nbetween photosynthetic 13C fractionation and pCO2 used\nfor the model inversion of the observed benthic forami-\nniferal d13C curve.\n7. Summary and Conclusion\n[55] We test if globally high benthic foraminiferal d13C\nvalues reflect enhanced sequestration of 12C in pelagic\nsediments of the Atlantic Ocean during the period 17\u2013\n14 Ma via an increase in marine productivity. Our results\nindicate that at all three sites examined, the long-term trend\nin geochemical- and foraminiferal-derived paleoproductiv-\nity does not follow the d13C record. Although the data from\nmarine sediments do not indicate enhanced oceanic carbon\nsequestration in the mid-Miocene d13C maximum, we\nexamine the amount of extra carbon stored and explore\npossible reasons for the shift with a numerical model.\nSequestration of 1.5 \u0001 1018 mol C over the period of 3 Ma\nleads to a 0.9% d13C positive excursion in the deep ocean,\nwhich is the observed magnitude in records. Global\ntemperature changes (both positive and negative) have\nnegligible impact on the isotopic composition of the deep\nocean carbon reservoir. A rise in global marine productivity\nhas the potential to cause the enrichment, but our empirical\ndata suggest that deep-sea sediments in the Atlantic Ocean\nregistered no such rise in productivity. An increase in\ncontinental organic carbon sequestration appears to be the\nmost feasible way to enrich the ocean\u2019s carbon pool with 13C,\nand is consistent with coeval lignite deposits worldwide.\nAppendix A\nA1. Model Description\n[56] The model used here is a global geochemical box\nmodel including carbon, alkalinity and phosphorous cycle\ncoupled with a one-dimension climate model. This later\nmodule is an energy balance model (EBM) that calculates\nthe annual mean temperature in 18 latitudinal bands as a\nfunction of atmospheric pCO2 [Franc\u00b8ois and Walker, 1992].\nThe geochemical model is an updated version of the one\nused by Grard et al. [2005]. It contains an atmospheric box\nand 4 oceanic reservoirs: equatorial surface, polar surface,\nthermocline and deep layer (see Figure A1). Other\nmodifications were performed, notably for the weathering\nlaws that include a dependence on soil CO2 and physical\nerosion (equations (A1)\u2013(A3)).\nfsilw;i \u00bc Asil;i \b Ri \b a \b exp Csil \bWT\u00f0 \u00de \b rco2 \b smech \u00f0A1\u00de\nfcarw;i \u00bc Acar;i \b b \b Ccar \b Cai \u00f0A2\u00de\nforgw;i \u00bc Aorg \b Ri \b g \b spmech \u00f0A3\u00de\nAsil,i represent the continental area of exposed granitic or\nbasaltic surfaces in latitude band i, Ri the continental runoff\nin latitude band i, a is constant for granite or basalt and\ncalibrated for the present-day state in order to have the\nactual values for the weathering fluxes calculated by\nGaillardet et al.

The carbonate weathering\nlaw is a function of continental carbonate area (Acar),\ncontinental runoff (Ri) and calcium ion concentration in\nequilibrium with calcite and atmospheric CO2 (Cai) in each\nlatitude band.\n[57] The kerogen weathering law is similar to the silicate\nweathering law, but no dependence on temperature is\nassumed and a power p is used for smech (p = 0.3)\n[Wallmann, 2001].\n[58] In the box model, a conservative equation is written\nfor carbon (Ci), alkalinity (Alki), phosphorous (Pi) and\ncarbon isotopic composition (d13Ci) of each oceanic\nreservoir. The fluxes taken into account in these budgets\ninvolve both internal fluxes within the ocean atmosphere\nsystem (short-term fluxes) and external fluxes between this\nsystem and crustal reservoirs (long-term fluxes), (see Figure\nA1). The long-term fluxes are global mantle degassing\n(fvol), carbonate deposition (fcard), organic carbon sequestra-\ntion (forgd), continental carbonate weathering (fcarw) and\ncontinent organic-rich sediment weathering (Forgw, kerogen\nweathering). The short-term fluxes are: mixing between\nocean boxes (wmix), biological new production (Prod) and\nocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange.\nA2. Model Calibration\n[59] The model is calibrated on the present-day conditions\nin equilibrium with 280 ppmv. Carbonate and silicate\nweathering fluxes are calibrated to fit the present-day values\nproposed by Gaillardet et al. [1999]. The resulting, present-\nday values of all long-term carbon fluxes and d13C are\npresented in Table A1.\n[60] The Miocene preperturbation state (19 Ma) is defined\nby applying Miocene paleogeography, by setting physical\nerosion to a value 35% lower than today [Wold and Hay,\n1990] and by fixing global degassing to 4.73 \u0001 1012 mol\na\u00031, a value derived from the change in seafloor accretion\nrate reported by Cogne\u00b4 and Humler [2006]. Oceanic organic\ncarbon deposition is calibrated to a value of 2 \u0001 1012 mol\na\u00031 and continental organic carbon sequestration is fixed to\n2.3 \u0001 1012 mol a\u00031. The model reaches a Miocene steady\nstate with atmospheric pCO2 at 264 ppmv, the calcite\ncompensation depth (CCD) at 3875 m and the d13C of deep\nocean at 0.799%. These values for the Miocene (near\n19 Ma) are in agreement with proxy data compiled by Royer\n[2006] for atmospheric pCO2, with data from van Andel\n[1975] and Opdyke and Wilkinson [1988, 1993] for the\nCCD and with the data from Zachos et al. [2001], and this\nstudy, for the d13C of the deep ocean. The value of all long-\nterm carbon fluxes and d13C for this preperturbation state\nare also listed in Table A1.\nA3. Model Details Pertaining to the Columbia\nRiver Flood Basalts\n[61] CRB and associated flood basalts of mid-Miocene\nage in North America have an estimated total volume of\n234000 km3 [Hales et al., 2005], which corresponds to an\nemission of 1.24 \u0001 1017 mol of CO2, if the same ratio is\nassumed as for Deccan basalts [Dessert et al., 2001]. Their\neruption was initiated near 17 Ma and its main phase lasted\napproximately 1.3 Ma [Hales et al., 2005; Camp et al.,\n2003]. Total area of the CRB is 163700 km2 [Chesley and\nRuiz, 1998]. In the model, following the methodology used\nby Dessert et al. [2001] for the Deccan traps, we assumed\nthat the CRB were emplaced between 17 Ma and 15.7 Ma,\nwith a constant CO2 emission flux of 9.54 \u0001 1010 mol a\u00031\nand a progressive linear increase of the basalt area over this\ntime interval. This emplacement of CRB was implemented\nas a sensitivity test on run 4; that is, basalt emplacement\noccurs together with organic deposition on land.\n[62] Acknowledgments. We are grateful to K.
