Introduction 1   \n \nA 2009 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report \nclaims that \u201cinformation and communication technologies (ICTs) have proven to be a \ntremendous accelerator of economic and social progress\u201d (UNCTAD, 2009: xi). The \npotential contribution of ICTs to development has come to prominence because these \nare regarded as General Purpose Technologies (GPTs) (Freeman and Lou\u00e7a, 2001; \nHelpman, 1998).  As these technologies take hold throughout societies, they are \naccompanied by major structural, cultural, social and economic transformations. \nHowever, claims that the transformative potential of these technologies is necessarily \nconsistent with human development aspirations are symptomatic of a Western-centric \nand universalist model of economic growth and development. In this paper I contrast \nthe dominant model with those more consistent with Escobar\u2019s (2002: 1) call for \n\u201canother way of thinking, un paradigma otro\u201d. I argue that, even when alternative models \nwith respect to development are seen to influence policy and practice, the discourse \nconcerning ICT interventions invariably is reminiscent of the dominant model.  \n \nThe predominant model is an \u2018exogenous\u2019 one. In the social sciences, and especially in \neconomics, the term \u2018exogenous\u2019 is used in a similar fashion to biology, chemistry or \nphysics to refer to something having an external cause or origin. The term \u2018endogenous\u2019, \nin contrast, refers to anything with an internal cause or origin. Models aligned with the \nformer term are often employed to justify interventions aimed at using new technologies \nto stimulate economic growth in the developing world.  For instance, investments in \nICTs, in the form of the Internet and the World Wide Web, and, more recently, mobile \ntelephony, are seen as \u2018exogenous\u2019 interventions that can close technology gaps between \nthe rich and the poor.2  When the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were \nannounced in 2000 they included Goal 8, aimed at stimulating access to ICTs.3  \nEndogenous models have been developed to provide insight into the factors such as \nthose associated with learning and the local context that influence the development \nprocesses. Endogenous models are greatly overshadowed by exogenous models in ICT \npolicy discourses. This is partly because of the privileging of economic theories which \nassume that information and knowledge are synonymous, but also because of a strong \nneoliberal policy emphasis on market-led development. Market-led policies are often \n\u00a0 3\ndominated by the interests of technology developers and content producers in the global \n\u2018North\u2019 whose principal ambition is profits from the sale of digital technologies and \ncontent.4 This is not surprising, but it has serious consequences because it makes it \ndifficult to encourage development practice that is compatible with \u201cun paradigma atro\u201d.  \n \nThe aim of this paper is to examine key discourses on ICT and development over an \nextended period to illustrate, firstly, that even when insights from endogenous models \ninform these texts, there is persistent recourse to a perception of the way ICTs \ncontribute to development goals that is aligned with exogenous models. And, secondly, \nthat even when efforts are made to engage in interventions compatible with insights \nderived from endogenous models, there are few signs that asymmetrical power relations \nwhich work against the valorisation of multiple knowledges are being countered \neffectively. Section 2 provides a brief introduction to the exogenous and endogenous \nmodels. In Section 3, a sample of discourses on the role of ICTs in development that \nappear in reports produced by agencies of the United Nations and the World Bank is \ndiscussed to illustrate how these discourses align with these models. In Section 4 \nendogenous approaches emphasising multiple sources of knowledge and emergent \noutcomes of ICT-related interventions are considered as an emerging strand of research \nand practice that has been gaining traction in recent years. The concluding section \nconsiders changes that would be needed to encourage ICT interventions that are better \naligned with endogenous models, human development goals and \u2018bottom up\u2019 approaches \nto investment in ICTs.   \n \n \n2. Exogenous and Endogenous Models \n \nIn the economics discipline, exogenous theories inform and justify interventions aimed at \nstimulating growth because of the way that economic logic deals with technological \nchange as an influence on economic growth.  Economists traditionally take technological \nchange to be exogenous. In the exogenous growth or neoclassical model, the long run \nrate of growth is determined exogenously because technological change, a fundamental \nexplanatory factor of labour productivity, is exogenous to the economic system (Solow, \n1956, 1957). It comes as no surprise, therefore, that ICTs, as GPTs, became a focal point \n\u00a0 4\nfor investment, since these technologies are associated with contributions to productivity \ngains and new organisational forms.  \n \nEndogenous economic growth theory was developed in response to criticism of the \nexogenous model, focusing on factors such as the institutional set-up and policy \nmeasures within the parameters of economic models (Arrow, 1962; Romer, 1990, 1994; \nRosenberg, 1982). Investments in ICTs and digital content are key issues for endogenous \ngrowth theorists because of the way they influence learning and adjustment to changing \nmarket and social conditions. However, in spite of their emphasis on endogenous factors \nthat influence change, this model from economics is often used to justify policies \nencouraging the openness of developing countries to knowledge and technologies from \nexogenous sources\u00a0(Cassiolato, et al., 2003; Freeman and Soete, 1997; Perez, 1983).  \n \nIn the fields of science and technology studies and information systems innovation, there \nare other endogenous models that offer a more reflexive and contextualised approach to \nICT intervention strategies in line with Albagli and Maciel\u2019s (2010: 18) claims that \u201cthere \nis no single model that must be followed\u201d and \u201cno culture has a monopoly on the factors \nfor successful socio-economic development\u201d. 5 Among these endogenous models are \nthose emphasising the epistemology of knowledge in different communities of situated \npractice, the role of power, and the implications for learning and development \n(McFarlane, 2006). Often called \u2018practice-based approaches\u2019, these are associated with \naction research and with working with local communities on ICT intervention strategies. \nSuch approaches include interpretivist socio-technical perspectives such as those \ndiscussed by Avgerou (2002) or Orlikowski (2000) and by Chambers (2008) Friere \n(1970\/1996) or Gumucio-Dagron (2009). As Leach et al. (2008: 731) suggest, there is \ngrowing acknowledgement of \u201cmultiple knowledges and perspectives (diverse sciences in \ntheir broader sense of ways of knowing) in understanding what is going on and why it \nmatters\u201d. The next section of this paper examines whether these endogenous models can \nbe seen to be informing discourses on ICT intervention in the development context. \n \n3. ICT and Models for Development \n \nIn the late 1990s, then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan seemed, like many others, to \nhave become captivated by the potentially wealth-creating advantages of ICTs.6 He \n\u00a0 5\nsuggested that the \u201cinformatics revolution\u201d needed to be harnessed for the benefit of \n\u201cmankind\u201d (Annan, 1997).7 The momentum behind a drive to close technology and \nknowledge \u2018gaps\u2019 in line with the exogenous model, culminated in the World Summit on \nthe Information Society (WSIS), held in Geneva in 2003 and Tunis in 2005, under the \nauspices of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The documentation \nproduced in the lead up, and subsequent, to the WSIS, is the subject of a large amount of \nresearch.  There was a dialogue about the need to move towards what I characterise as \nendogenous approaches, but many have argued that this was not evident in the WSIS \noutcomes.8  And by 2010, MDG ICT Goal 8 was being understood to relate principally \nto promoting the diffusion of mobile phones and Internet access points\u00a0(UN, 2010), still \nvery much in line with the exogenous model.  \n \n3.1 Empirical Approach \n \nKey institutions with a global remit to influence policy and intervention strategies \nconcerned with ICTs include the ITU and UNESCO (MacLean, 2011 forthcoming),9 \ntogether with the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nand the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). All of \nthese have allocated resources to ICT interventions in the decades of the 1990s and \n2000s.10 The sample of reports on which my analysis of discourses on ICTs and \ndevelopment is based includes those published between 1998 and 2009.11 The key texts \nused to examine the discourses employed by the authors of these reports were derived \nfrom a keyword search performed on the selection of reports.12 A formal discourse \nmethod was not applied but a thematic analysis was undertaken of the resulting texts \nwhereby paragraphs containing keywords were copied into a spreadsheet resulting in \nsome 350 entries.  These were reviewed and organised according to whether they used \nlanguage aligned with the exogenous or endogenous models and whether the two models \nwere positioned closely with or without acknowledgement of the different assumptions \nthey imply. The aim of the analysis was not to trace individual authorship or motivation \nor to examine a sample representative of all reports during the period. The goal was to \nillustrate the ways of articulating the role of ICTs in development interventions and to \ndetect any shifts or inconsistencies in the orientation of these discourses with respect to \nthe exogenous and endogenous models.13 It is assumed that power relations are \n\u00a0 6\narticulated through the discourses employed in reports discussed in this paper, but I do \nnot develop a theory of power here.14 The following sections illustrate how some of \nthese texts are aligned with the models. \n \n3.2 The World Bank Perspective \n \nInterventions to foster a global knowledge society based partly on the spread of digital \ntechnologies have been informed by the exogenous or neoclassical model which suggests \nthat \u201cknowledge is like light\u201d.15  \u201cWeightless and intangible, it can easily travel the world, \nenlightening the lives of people everywhere\u201d (World Bank, 1999: 1). The World Bank\u2019s \nreport on Knowledge for Development at the end of the 1990s, insisted that \u201cinformation \nproblems\u201d or incomplete knowledge about attributes, such as the quality of products or \nthe creditworthiness of firms, represent knowledge gaps. The key challenge was seen as \nensuring access to more knowledge to address know-how problems. The fact that \u201cnew \ncommunications technologies and plummeting computing costs are shrinking distance \nand eroding borders and time\u201d (World Bank, 1999: i), provided reason for hope that the \ndiffusion of ICTs would help to fill knowledge gaps, thereby enabling market-led growth \nin the developing countries.   \n \nIn line with the exogenous model, there is little differentiation between external and \nindigenous information and, in fact, external knowledge is privileged over internal \nknowledge as it is understood to reflect \u2018frontier\u2019 or the \u2018most advanced\u2019 practice. The \npolicy emphasis seemed clear.  Emphasis was to be placed first and foremost on an open \ntrading regime, foreign investment and technology licensing, \u201cfacilitating the flow of \ninformation essential for effective markets\u201d (World Bank, 1999: 2).  The role for \ndevelopment agencies also seemed straightforward since the transfer of knowledge and \ninvestment in technology were seen as the two main keys to growth. The need for a \ncapacity to absorb new knowledge was acknowledged and this encouraged an emphasis \non education (World Bank, 1999).  \n \nDespite acknowledging that human capital and education are crucial, however, \ntechnologies were expected to provide access to external knowledge and to boost the \nknowledge accumulation process. Wherever feasible, countries were encouraged to adopt \npolicies to enable them to \u201cleapfrog\u201d the industrial countries, that is, to invest in the \n\u00a0 7\nmost innovative, leading-edge technologies to boost their economies, just as the \u2018East \nAsian Tiger\u2019 countries \u2013 given their specific combinations of resources \u2013 had been seen \nto do.  For the Bank, other countries in the global \u2018South\u2019 similarly were expected to \nleapfrog obsolete ICTs and to use digital innovations \u201cto take advantage of the new \ninformation and communications technologies in disseminating knowledge\u201d (emphasis \nadded) (World Bank, 1999: 57).16 The precepts of the exogenous model of acquiring \nexternal knowledge, disseminating it, and ensuring its absorption, appear throughout this \nreport. Although inequalities are acknowledged, the prescribed policies are in line with \nthe exogenous model with its focus on redressing \u201cinformation problems\u201d to stimulate \neconomic growth. The exogenous or neoclassical economic model takes as its starting \npoint a given income distribution with the result that, as MacPherson (1964: 494) put it, \nthis is a theory that assists in the maintenance of \u201ca massive inequality between owners \nand workers\u201d, limiting the fulfilment of citizen\u2019s capacities.17 The World Bank had \nmaintained its emphasis on \u201cinformation problems\u201d and \u201cknowledge gaps\u201d (World \nBank, 2004: 7) when the WSIS was convened in the mid-2000s.  \n \n3.3 Variations on the Endogenous Model  \n \nThe UNDP (1990) Human Development Report saw development as being about enlarging \nthe choices available to the poor.  This report put a strong emphasis on individual \ncapabilities, an approach more closely aligned with the endogenous model.  In the 1999 \nHuman Development Report, published in the same year as the World Bank\u2019s report on \nKnowledge for Development, the economist, Streeten, argued that human development is \nabout \u201cchoices that are created by expanding human capabilities and functionings\u2014what \npeople do and can do in their lives\u201d (UNDP, 1999: 16).18 This report was also influenced \nby the work of Sen (1999). He had argued persistently for a turn away from concerns \nprimarily with income or utility, towards the capabilities available to people to meet their \naspirations. As Alkire (2010: 3) reminds us, the 1990 UNDP report asserted that \u201cpeople \nare the real wealth of a nation. The basic objective of development is to create an \nenabling environment for people to live long, healthy and creative lives\u201d. Nevertheless, in \nspite of a strong emphasis on people, their values, capabilities and choices, in line with an \nendogenous model, those authoring the 1999 report, were also informed by the \ndominant exogenous model. They turned to ICTs and reducing the \u201ctechnology gap\u201d as \na means of bringing about \u201cdevelopment\u201d (UNDP, 1999: 63). Although it is observed \n\u00a0 8\nthat \u201cwhen the market goes too far in dominating social and political outcomes, the \nopportunities and rewards of globalization spread unequally and inequitably\u201d (UNDP, \n1999: 2), the solution is to \u201censure that the information revolution leads to human \ndevelopment\u201d (UNDP, 1999: 10).  \n \nWhen the UNDP Human Development Report turned to human rights issues and to new \ntechnologies in 2000 and 2001, respectively, the role of local stakeholders in the human \ndevelopment process was acknowledged in line with the endogenous model, but the \nprimary goal appeared, nevertheless, to be that of meeting the promise of technology and \nknow-how.  Thus, stakeholders \u201c..have a role in transforming the potential of global resources \nand the promise of technology\u201d (emphasis added) (UNDP, 2000: 1) and the \u201cthe aim is to diffuse \ninnovations widely\u201d (emphasis added) (UNDP, 2001: 43). The report\u2019s authors turned to \nexogenous ICTs to promote growth, despite their insistence on policies more compatible \nwith the endogenous model. \n \nThe emphasis in UNESCO\u2019s reports aligns more closely with endogenous models, given \nits greater emphasis on cultural and social issues as compared to the remits of other \ninstitutions in the sample. UNESCO\u2019s reports contain texts that portray the exogenous \nmodel of information flows as the antithesis of the encouragement of bottom-up \ndevelopment (Hamelink, 2000: 37; UNESCO, 1996).  In 2005, UNESCO\u2019s Knowledge \nSocieties report emphasized that \u201cevery society has its own knowledge assets. It is \ntherefore necessary to work towards connecting the forms of knowledge that societies \nalready possess and the new forms of development, acquisition and spread of knowledge \nvalued by the knowledge economy model\u201d (UNESCO, 2005: 17).19  \n \nThe WSIS meetings in the mid-2000s brought together a wide range of stakeholders \nadvocating strategies for ICT and development in line with technology and market-led \n(exogenous) development models as well as perspectives more compatible with \nendogenous approaches to human development, emphasising cultural diversity and \nparticipation. A shift towards the discourse of endogenous models and greater \nacknowledgement of the deficiencies of top-down (exogenous) ICT policies and \nstrategies in enabling communities to make use of ICTs in line with their own choices \nand aspirations might have been expected to start appearing in subsequent ICT and \ndevelopment reports. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of such a shift.  \n\u00a0 9\n \n3.4 Evidence of Learning \n \nIn 2009, the authors of the World Bank\u2019s World Development Report argued that the \ndiffusion of ICTs will drive convergence between leading and lagging areas of the world \nsuch that \u201cglobalization and technological progress in transportation and communication \npotentially provide a wider range of means to bridge the economic distance between \nleading and lagging areas\u201d (World Bank, 2009: 93). It is principally the exogenous model \nthat informs this perspective: \u201cAccess to knowledge is easier\u201d (World Bank, 2009: 95) \nand it potentially enables the poor to benefit from developments at the world\u2019s \ntechnological frontier, replicating the earlier successes of the East Asian economies.20  \nThe assumption is that the diffusion of ICTs and the removal of restrictions on the \u201cfree \nflow of ideas\u201d, along-side material improvements as a result of urbanisation, will enable \n\u201cpeople [to] choose to live where they expect to be best off in material and nonmaterial \nwell-being\u201d (World Bank, 2009: 62).  \n \nA similar focus is present in UNCTAD reports, although the authors of these reports \nexhibit greater concern with the exogenous model, highlighting its failure to focus on \npower asymmetries. In UNCTAD\u2019s Information Economy Report 2006, the discourse \nassociated with multi-stakeholder and participatory approaches starts to be visible: \n\u201creality shows that different technologies have different contributions to make to \npoverty reduction and that, in order to be effective, pro-poor ICT efforts must be \nembedded in poverty reduction initiatives (including national development strategies) \nand best practices (such as multi-stakeholder and participatory approaches\u201d (UNCTAD, \n2006: xxiv).  However, in effect, this means little more than the development of ICT \nmaster plans, designed in a top-down way to achieve targets and objectives at the \nnational level, with insufficient attention given to local contexts and to bottom-up \napproaches, despite participatory dialogue in the process of devising the plans (Okpaku, \n2002).21\n \nIn 2008, there is discussion of the knowledge gap and the need to foster technology \ndiffusion, albeit through capacity building.  Countries are asked to focus on technological \ninnovation and to establish \u201cthe capacity to generate, assimilate, disseminate and \neffectively use knowledge\u201d (UNCTAD, 2008: 1). References to modernization are in \n\u00a0 10\nevidence, as is the economic exogenous model, suggesting that \u201cin the area of knowledge \ndiffusion and technology transfer, externalities and spillovers can yield enormous \nbenefits for the economy as a whole, and for the rest of world in the presence of \ntechnology flows among countries\u201d (UNCTAD, 2008: 7).   \n \nEarlier ICT gaps are seen to be filled by the spread of mobile phones, suggesting that if \none has a subscription to a mobile phone, other factors that lead to persistent poverty \nwill soon start to be overcome (Indjikian and Siegel, 2005). This approach stands in \ncontrast to Sen\u2019s position when he argues that \u201cthe capability approach focuses on \nhuman lives, and not just on the resources people have, in the form of owning \u2013 or \nhaving use of \u2013 objects of convenience that a person may possess\u201d (Sen, 2009: 253), and \nindeed, to Nussbaum\u2019s (2001: 40) observation that \u201cinternational development projects \nhave often gone wrong through insufficient attunement to cultural variety and \nparticularity\u201d. In contrast, the UNCTAD discourse conveys the impression that \u201cthe full \nright to communicate and participate in the information society\u201d might be met by \nensuring that \u201cthe mobile revolution puts a portable handset in the hands of all adults\u201d \n(UNCTAD, 2009: 20) \u2013 very much the exogenous approach.  \n \nUNESCO reports in the post-WSIS period call for actions aimed at the diffusion of \nICTs and digital media, but they do so with reference to \u201ccore principles\u201d such as equity, \ngender sensitivity, inclusion and cultural sensitivity (UNESCO, 2007b).  As the discourse \nshifts from ICT diffusion and \u201cinformation problems\u201d towards \u201ccommunication for \ndevelopment\u201d, 22 UNESCO calls for \u201ca focus on the needs of marginalized groups and \nan in-depth understanding of the national communication environment\u201d (UNESCO, \n2007a: 11). Its 2007 report says there should be greater emphasis on the communicative \nprocess, rather than on technology per se (UNESCO, 2007a: 33), consistent with the \nendogenous model. Other UNESCO reports also display criticism of the exogenous \nvision of the knowledge society. In Investing in Cultural Diversity and Intercultural Dialogue, \nthe authors overtly call attention to the \u2018exogenous modernization paradigm\u2019 (UNESCO, \n2009: 191). Its authors write, \u201cwhen \u2018development\u2019 is imposed upon a society from the \noutside, this invariably leads to ecological and societal dislocation\u201d (UNESCO, 2009: \n192). This report drives home the notion that the exogenous model of information or \nknowledge acquisition should not be privileged.  \n \n\u00a0 11\nThe authors of these reports do not, however, escape the seduction of technology \nconsistent with the exogenous model. For example, in 2009, ICT benefits are couched, \nnot in terms of investment and access points, but in terms of the benefits of user-friendly \nsoftware and low cost devices (UNESCO, 2009: 146). The impacts of new technologies \nsuch as social media and Web 2.0, resulting in new forms of sociability and solidarity, are \nseen as furthering \u201cexchanges within and between minority groups and between majority \nand minority groups\u201d (UNESCO, 2009: 237). Technology is, however, uncritically \nassociated with the forces of \u201cthe good\u201d as the emphasis is on the positive impacts of \ntechnological innovation (UNESCO, 2009: 108). This is so even though there is evidence \nthat ICTs may also be associated with malevolent forces (Bennett, 2003) and it is \nacknowledged by the authors that the impacts of ICTs have yet to be fully understood.  \n \nOn balance, it appears that the interpenetration of the exogenous and endogenous \nmodels has not resulted in a consistent distancing of the latter from the former in a way \nthat encourages departures from advocacy of investment in technology as a solution. A \n\u201cone knowledge system\u201d is favoured; one that is out of step with an understanding of \nhuman development that \u201caims to expand people\u2019s freedoms \u2013 the worthwhile \ncapabilities people value \u2013 and to empower people to engage actively in development \nprocesses, on a shared planet\u201d (Alkire, 2010: 40). The endogenous model \u201cposits that \nhuman beings are the ends as well as the means of development, challenging the focus of \nmany economists and policymakers on per capita economic growth\u201d as the principal aim \n(Hulme, 2010: 15). But policy discourse remains mainly concerned with addressing ICT \nand knowledge gaps in line with the exogenous model and neoliberal policies privileging \nexternal agencies and firm interests in diffusing technologies. Hulme argues that it is the \ninterests of the economically powerful countries and international institutions that are \nshaping progress towards the MDG targets. This does not fit well with \u2018bottom-up\u2019 \napproaches aimed at facilitating the capabilities to choose how best to incorporate \ntechnologies into people\u2019s lives.23   \n \nEven if there are some signs in the post WSIS period of a shift towards endogenous \napproaches in the context of development initiatives, there is little evidence of a \nconsistent turn to an endogenous approach that embraces respect for multiple \nknowledges or practice-based approaches when it comes to ICT interventions. In its \n2009 report, UNESCO refers to the fact that \u201cthe concept of learning communities or \n\u00a0 12\nlearning societies has arisen of late to emphasize the value of self-learning and innovative \nlearning in the context of adapting to needs and shaping one\u2019s desired future\u201d \n(UNESCO, 2009: 108). \u201cSelf-learning\u201d and what this might imply in practice is a theme \nin discussions about the importance of multiple knowledges and practice-based \napproaches in the development process. Notwithstanding this observation, digital \ntechnologies such as mobiles or the Internet and software applications such as Web 2.0 \ncontinue to be closely linked to the production, circulation and appropriation of external \n\u2018knowledge\u2019 for development. For instance, what is needed for \u2018e-development\u2019 is the \nharnessing of the digital network paradigm, one that is \u201crelevant to developed and \ndeveloping countries alike\u201d.24 This view discounts the political character of knowledge \nand is inconsistent with endogenous models that emphasise the importance of multiple \nknowledges. \n \n4. Multiple Knowledges Perspectives \n \nThe challenge in developing ICTs in ways that are responsive to a human-centred \ndevelopment process requires a much more consistent move towards endogenous \napproaches embracing receptivity to participatory approaches and to multiple sources of \nknowledge. Such a move provides opportunities to overcome persistent biases \n\u201cfavouring knowledge and values that are developed in the North, over the local \nknowledge, concepts, language and understanding of civil society and staff in the South\u201d \n(Zirschky, 2009: 8).25 An analysis of the ways that information derived from participatory \napproaches is used by international non-governmental organisations concludes that, even \nwhen these organisations pursue \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approaches to ICTs, \u201cmany of the \nstructures and systems they employ strengthen or reinforce existing power relations, \nbased on wealth and notions of scientific or expert knowledge\u201d (Beardon and Newman, \n2009: 24).  \n \nA research programme funded by the Dutch government has sought to tackle some of \nthese issues.  Participants in the Information and Knowledge Management (IKM)\u2013 \nEmergent programme are attempting to privilege the endogeneity of ICT and \nknowledge-oriented interventions.26 The programme, which includes academics and \npractitioners in the global \u2018North\u2019 and the \u2018South\u2019, has turned to \u201cpractice-based \napproaches\u201d in an effort to develop ICT-related interventions that are responsive to the \n\u00a0 13\naspirations of those for whom policy interventions are intended. Ferguson et al. (2008), \nfor example, have developed a practice-based, community-driven approach to ICTs that \naims to privilege \u201cepistemic diversity\u201d (Molenaar, 2006).  Rather than emphasizing the \nexport of knowledge, the priority is to foster local knowledge capacities. Here, \u201cdifferent \ndiscourses, different knowledges can coexist, rather than placing a single knowledge \nparadigm at the heart of all development discourses\u201d (Ferguson, et al., 2008: 30).  \n \nThe attraction of \u201cblueprints\u201d or templates for policy and action with respect to ICTs \nbased on the exogenous model developed by economists is attributable partly to the fact \nthat policy makers find it difficult to negotiate a path among the different discourses.  \nThe result is a tendency to draw on the dominant model in a decontextualised way and to \napply insights derived from it in contexts relating to technology where they have little, \nno, or different meanings (Jones, 2009).  Powell, the co-ordinator of the IKM-Emergent \nProgramme, argues that \u2018development\u2019 is a process which depends on \u201c..an appreciation \nof the perceptions of local populations as to their options in that reality. Without such \n\u2018knowledge\u2019, interventions fail, as we have seen time and time again\u201d (Powell, 2006: 520).  \n \nEndogenous models that emphasise local knowledge and learning in situated contexts \noften turn to practice-based approaches which value epistemic diversity and meaning \nconstruction in local contexts. One means of achieving this in the case of ICT \ninterventions is to enable the meanings of technology to emerge through open, \nemergent, processes of dialogue which respect multiple sources of knowledge (Zirschky, \n2009: 22).  The IKM-Emergent Programme has sought to give a higher profile to \nalternatives to the dominant discourses on ICTs and development. The aim is to reflect \non the positions of those claiming expertise with respect to ICTs which has been \nacquired in contexts that differ from their application. In this way, there may be \nopportunities to counter biases in policy prescriptions and actions that make it difficult \nto be responsive to local aspirations.  In line with the discourses enabling talk about \n\u201cworlds and knowledges otherwise\u201d (Escobar 2002:1), and rooted in resistance to \nsingular, universalising models of social and technical change, participants in this \nprogramme seek to acknowledge that the development and application of technologies \ncan best be understood as \u201ca consequence of the interactions of local agents\u201d (Mowles, \net al., 2008: 810).  \n \n\u00a0 14\nThe programme is not without its problems.  Some are a reflection of the values \nembedded in the particular designs of specific ICT systems.  As Kirimi and Wakwabubi\u2019s \nstudy on the use of knowledge yielded by participatory approaches in Kenya indicates \n\u201cthis knowledge is not only inaccessible to most people but \u2026 it is also stored in formats that \nare not user-friendly. Learning is therefore hampered by the way knowledge is stored and \nmade accessible by organizations to both internal and external audiences\u201d (emphasis \nadded) (Kirimi and Wakwabubi, 2009: 1). Other problems are linked to the challenge of \ncommunicating with those working mainly with frameworks offered by the prevailing \nmodels as indicated in the discourses of the reports discussed above. In most cases, these \nassume a simple cause and effect relationship between ICT programme initiatives and \noutcomes (Thompson, 2008). In contrast, the IKM-Emergent Programme offers \nsuggestions about how \u201cto set out an alternative, or rather, a series of alternatives to \ncurrent majority practice\u201d (IKM Emergent, 2010: 12; Mowles, 2008: 6).   \n \nThe concept of multiple knowledges is helpful in challenging views consistent with the \ndominant exogenous model because it questions the epistemological foundations that \nmany development organisations are working with. In so doing, it is possible to lay bear \nassumptions about power relationships, to see how they are being replicated, and to \ndevelop strategies of resistance. By insisting on \u201cemergence\u201d, that is, an understanding \nthat \u201cuncommon combinations of common events and circumstances\u201d emerge that \ncannot be predicted (Hedstr\u00f6m, 2005: 100), it is possible to move beyond the prevailing \nendogenous economic models. Meaning construction leading to new knowledge about \nICTs can follow a pattern that combines the expected, unexpected and unwanted \n(Mowles, 2008: 10). Interventions aimed at the use of ICTs in support of development \nmay be encouraged that are open to emergent developments, rather than being locked \ninto the premises of plans created at the beginning of an ICT intervention. Following \napproaches that are explicitly open to creative bottom-up solutions is more likely to \nencourage the involvement of disparate groups in a dialogue that leads to a continuous \nreframing of ideas and actions. In turn, this may enable ICTs are to be more effectively \nembedded in local contexts in ways that are valued by local groups. \n \nThere are indications that community-driven, collaborative production of ICT \napplications is opening new spaces for bottom-up, potentially empowering developments \nin the application of ICTs.  There can be little doubt that various forms of interactive \n\u00a0 15\nsocial media will continue to spread, notwithstanding the policies and practices adopted \nby external institutions.  Whether these developments will successfully evade existing \nasymmetric power relationships as they spread is a matter for empirical assessment, \nespecially with respect to their financial sustainability.  If those developing creative uses \nof, for example, mobile phones for payments by entrepreneurs or their use by health \ncollectives to bring important information to rural areas, are successful in eluding the \ninterests of those who formulate ICT projects exogenously and finance them through \n\u2018top down\u2019 initiatives, then these initiatives may indeed provide important evidence of \nthe benefits of endogenous or bottom-up strategies.  However, the exogenous model, \nand ICT-related funding initiatives promoted by companies and other external \nstakeholders in the development community in the name of this model, remains well-\nentrenched.  This model therefore needs to be contested, both by exposing its limitations \nand by demonstrating that it is predicated on assumptions that are inconsistent with a \nhuman development agenda.  \n \n \n5. Conclusion \n \nThe analysis of the discourses employed by authors of the sample of reports considered \nhere confirms that most of those engaged with the challenge of meeting the MDG goals \nrelating to ICTs continue to be captivated by the idea, informed by the exogenous \nmodel, that \u201cknowledge is like light\u201d. The exogenous model favouring a focus on \n\u201ctechnology gaps\u201d, and the economics version of the endogenous model with its focus \non \u201cinformation problems\u201d, are present even when reference is made to participatory \nprocesses and the importance of local contexts in the development context. Where \nendogenous models informed by practice-based approaches are emphasised with respect \nto ICTs, policy is more likely to shift towards capabilities and human development \naspirations and lead to a greater awareness of the power asymmetries that sustain \nmeasures in line with the exogenous model.  Of course, awareness of the existence of \nsuch asymmetries is not synonymous with measures aimed at countering them. \n \nMany see great potential in recent ICT innovations such as social networking and Web \n2.0, for a \u201ccontinual dialogue between multiple modernisms and rationalities in a manner \nthat allows for judgement between these, and for a resultant, qualified, impulsion towards \n\u00a0 16\nprogress\u201d (Thompson, 2008: 823). There is evidence that this is happening, but it is as \neasy for these technologies to be appropriated by those who would exploit others as it is \nfor them to be appropriated by those concerned with social transformation that is \nregarded as being positive by local groups. For example, while many micro-entrepreneurs \nincluding women are benefiting from the increased accessibility of mobile phones, there \nare risks associated with these technologies when they reinforce existing unequal gender \nrelations (Ekine, 2010). When the dynamics of development, and specifically those of \nsocieties based partly on the use of ICTs, are understood as being emergent, the intended \nand unintended consequences of ICT-related interventions are more likely to be \nacknowledged. Interventions informed by this way of thinking are more likely to be \nflexible and the \u201coutcomes\u201d more consistent with changing local contexts (Rafiq and \nGulzar, 2009).  However, while understanding of these dynamics can serve as a bulwark \nagainst the assumption that social networking is always necessarily empowering, this is \nbut an initial step in the project of resistance against top-down agendas of external \nstakeholders and, indeed, of internal stakeholders that operate according to the \nassumptions of the exogenous model, for example, by providing technologies, but \nwithout attending to the cultural, social and often political measures that need to be put \nin place of enable them to be successfully appropriated by local users. \n \nWhile efforts to acknowledge multiple knowledges can help to move towards greater \nsensitivity to human development goals when ICT interventions are being developed, the \nproblem of how to deal with those whose visions of technology persist in adhering to the \nexogenous model, must still be addressed. Practice-based, emergence approaches offer \nan attractive way forward, but, on their own, they cannot address structures that give rise \nto power asymmetries and unequal relationships.27 If we are to enable respect for \nmultiple knowledges to influence action in the interests of the use of ICTs in developing \nnew capabilities, much remains to be done to trace the flows of competing ideas and to \nadvocate institutional arrangements and processes consistent with countering the \noutcomes commonly associated with the exogenous model.   \n \nResearch is needed to document the harm done by models of ICTs and development \nthat are not receptive to insights from perspectives that focus on endogenous models, \nemergent systems and experience in the field. The means for shifting discourses and \npractices are available to those who persist in advocacy of \u2018un paradigma otro\u2019 in the \n\u00a0 17\nforums that are available to them. Explicit acknowledgement of the rationales that \nmotivate different approaches offers a basis for negotiation of the contending discourses \nand, most importantly, the actions that follow from them. The World Bank, United \nNations agencies, donor agencies and other stakeholders play key roles in ICT \ninterventions.  If they shift more consistently towards endogenous approaches, including \na recognition of multiple knowledges and emergent outcomes, in line with moves more \ngenerally with respect the development field as a whole,28 there may be greater \npossibilities for influencing programmes of ICT intervention in line with the goals of \nhuman development. For this to happen, the realization that \u201cthere are no guarantees \nthat improved access to ICTs leads to poverty reduction\u201d (UNCTAD, 2010: xi), will \nhave to take hold and start informing the discourses of debate on investment in the new \ndigital technologies and their applications. In such cases, where greater attention may be \ngiven to the potential uses of ICTs in local contexts and questions are raised as to \nwhether and how external agencies should intervene, it is important to recall that costs \nare incurred and that these must be borne somehow, raising issues of financial flows, \nstakeholder interests and, inevitably, of power relationships and they way they are \narticulated in a particular local context. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAbramovitz M. 1986.

This version benefits from comments by Mike Powell, \nClaire Milne, and David Souter and by two referees. The opinions expressed here of course are \nmy own. \n2 Critical scholars were unconvinced that simply closing technology gaps would address \nunderlying power asymmetries, see, for example, (Hamelink, 1996; Heeks, 1996; Mansell and \nWehn, 1998; \u00d3 Siochr\u00fa, et al., 2002). \n3 \u201cIn cooperation with the private sector, make available benefits of new technologies, especially \ninformation and communications\u201d at http:\/\/www.undp.org\/mdg\/goal8.shtml. Some argue that \nthis was an afterthought without meaningful indicators, see (Lanvin, 2008) and (Fukuda-Parr, \n2010). \n4 Corporate representatives of ICT companies often participate in panels discussing the future of \nICT developments. For example, at the 5th meeting of the Internet Governance Forum \n\u00a0 26\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nestablished following the WSIS, corporate representatives comprised 23% of the participants \n(badges) of 1,993 as compared to 21% for civil society, 24% for government, 7% for \nintergovernmental, 3% for media, and 22% for the technical and academic communities, (IGF, \n2010). The following comment on the role of private interests in deliberations of this kind: \n(Adam and Gillwald, 2007; Cammaerts, 2008; Fuchs, 2009; Wilson, 2002). \n5. For other critiques of dominant approaches to ICTs and development, see (Avgerou and \nWalsham, 2000; Nulens and Van Audenhove, 1999; Wade, 2002). \n6 In the post-War period, in parallel with the growing emphasis on the \u201cinformation\u201d or \n\u201cknowledge\u201d society in the industrialised countries, the potential of ICTs started to become an \nissue in development planning. United Nations agencies began creating academic and policy \nexpert panels to discuss investment and the diffusion of computers, telecommunication \ninfrastructure and radio, television and, later, satellites to support development goals in the \n1060s.  Two reports of significance on ICTs, information and knowledge were the MacBride \nReport (ICSCP, 1980\/2004) emphasising an endogenous model (Mansell and Nordenstreng, \n2006) and the Missing Links Report (ICWTD, 1984) emphasising an exogenous model. For early \ndiscussions see (de Sola Pool, 1974; Melody, 1977; Quebral, 1975; Rangnekar, 1969; Rogers, \n1965) and, more recently,(Robison and Crenshaw, 2010; Wresch, 2009). \n7 This is not to suggest that Annan personally was persuaded by this view, but rather that he \npromoted this view in his position as Secretary-General of the UN. \n8 This is evident in the main texts produced by the WSIS which have a strong technology-led \norientation, see (UN\/ITU, 2003a, 2003b, 2005a, 2005b) and see (Padovani and Nordenstreng, \n2005; Raboy and Landry, 2005; Raboy, et al., 2010). \n9 MacLean provides an overview of the ITU; UNESCO; World Intellectual Property \nOrganization (WIPO); World Trade Organization (WTO); Internet Corporation for Assigned \nNames and Numbers (ICANN) and the Internet Governance Forum (IGF). \n10 \u2018ICT\u2019 is a label that encompasses older and newer technologies of media and communication.  \n11 Texts included in the sample are: UNDP Human development reports, 1999 \u2013 2009; \nUNCTAD reports on e-commerce and information economy 1999, 2005-2009; UNESCO, \nvarious report on information and knowledge, 1999-2009; World Bank World Reports 1998-\n2009; WIPO selected annual reports 1998-2009 and WIPO Intellectual Property and \nDevelopment reports 2008-2010 plus minutes of meetings of IP and Development Committee; \nITU major reports on ICTs, 1999-2009. In addition, though not formally included in the \nthematic analysis, UN Millennium Goal documents from 2000 and progress reports 2008 and \n2010, plus key WSIS documents 2003 and 2005 plus stocktaking and monitoring reports of 2010 \n(UN\/ITU, 2010a, 2010b).

These reports \nmay be more receptive to endogenous approaches but this requires an analysis beyond the scope \nof this paper. \n14 (Albagli and Maciel, 2010) offer a concise discussion of developments in ICTs in the context of several \ntheorisations of relations of power and discourse, mainly following Foucault.  My claim that the texts of \ndocuments such as those analysed in this paper provide a useful source, albeit not the only one, from \nwhich we can gain insight into these relations is consistent with their analysis.  \n15. This may also be a conflation of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s (1813: 1291) statement: \u201cHe who \nreceives ideas from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his \ntaper at mine receives light without darkening me\u201d.  \n16. See (Soete, 1985) for an early discussion of technological leapfrogging, (Abramovitz, 1986) \nfor factors that enable countries to catch up with leaders, and (Steinmueller, 2001\/2) for the \ndifficulties in undertaking this process. For discussion of the East Asian experience see (Amsden, \n1994; Asian Development Bank, 1997; Lall, 1994; World Bank, 1993). \n17 See (Mansell, 2011) on how this model favours neoliberal strategies in the context of ICT and \ndevelopment. \n18 See also (Streeten, 1982). \n19 Citing the work of (Ricoeur, 2004: 78). \n20 The model provided by the East Asian economies has been criticised, see (Kim and Nelson, \n2000) and (Marcelle, 2004). \n21 See also (Manyozo, 2010). \n22 See (Unwin, 2009) for a discussion. \n23 See also (Gore, 2010: 76) on a \u201cproductive capabilities approach\u201d based on heterodox \nendogenous growth theory. \n24 On the persistence of a technology-led perspective, see (Hanna, 2010: 9). \n25 There are some who remain sceptical of the benefits of making ICTs available for \nconsumption, see (Heeks, 2005; 2010). \n26 The writer is a member of the Steering Committee of IKM-Emergent. \n27 Such work could build on research on the influence of ideas in the international relations field \n(Finnemore, 1996), on the influence of politics in the development context with respect to \nintellectual property rights (Shadlen, 2009), and on government networks influencing the \nappropriations of ideas about development interventions (Martinez-Diaz and Woods, 2009). \n28 See (Zoellick, 2010). \n"}
