INTRODUCTION\nC ELLULAR metal foams are a relatively new class ofmaterial, which are of interest because of the excep-\ntional ability to adapt their mechanical, thermal, acoustic,\nelectrical, and chemical properties by varying their physical\ncompositions such as porosity (relative density), geometry of\nthe pores (shape, orientation, and size), and cell topologies\n(open-cell and closed-cell structure). Therefore, metallic foams\noffer many significant applications particularly in energy ab-\nsorption, thermal management, lightweight structures, and\nautomotive industry. There are wide ranges of manufacturing\nmethods for metal foams. In terms of precursory forms and the\ntypes of pore-forming agents, typical methods can be grouped\ninto melt-gas injection, melt-foaming agent, powder-foaming\nagent, pressure infiltration, and sintering-dissolution processes\n[1]. One interesting topic is to study the electrical properties\nof foams, which require nondestructive measurement. Eddy\ncurrent sensing satisfies this need and furthermore enables\nimproved control of metal foam processing through character-\nizing its electrical properties.\nEddy current methods have been used over several decades\nfor nondestructive material evaluation and inspection [2]\u2013[4].\nPassing an alternating current through an excitation coil gen-\nerates a fluctuating magnetic field in its vicinity. This time-\nvarying magnetic field induces eddy currents in the electrically\nManuscript received June 15, 2004; revised October 7, 2005.

The interaction between two fields alters the dis-\ntribution of the magnetic flux, resulting in an apparent change of\nthe coil impedance. By measuring this coil impedance change,\nthe nature of the material can be inferred and further recog-\nnized by correlating the coil impedance using analytical and\/or\nexperimental methods to the characteristic quantities of interest,\nsuch as electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, coating\nlayer thickness, etc.\nThis paper presents experimental results characterizing the\nprincipal properties of aluminum foams such as equivalent\nelectrical conductivity and porosity by means of eddy current\nsensing techniques. The application of eddy current inspection\ntechniques to metal foams is relatively new. The induced eddy\ncurrents flowing in the foam samples are affected significantly\nby the foam properties, and consequentially measurement of\nthe impedance change on the sensing coil(s) permits the metal\nfoams to be characterized.\nII. EDDY CURRENT SENSING METHODOLOGIES\nA. Diffusion Phenomenon\nEddy currents induced inside the test sample by the applied\nmagnetic field attenuate with depth below the test sample\nsurface. This attenuation is mainly governed by the test object\u2019s\nelectrical conductivity \u03c3, magnetic permeability \u00b5, and the\napplied frequency f for a given test geometry. The standard\ndepth of penetration \u03b4 can be used to characterize this diffusion\nphenomenon, which, for plane geometry, is mathematically\ngiven by\n\u03b4 =\n1\u221a\n\u03c0f\u00b5\u03c3\n(1)\nwhere for a nonmagnetic electrically conductive foam the value\nof \u00b5 virtually equals to the permeability of free space, i.e.,\n4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u22127 H\/m. Apparently, high frequency measurements\ngive information regarding the properties adjacent to the surface\nwhereas low frequency testing probes the subsurface deeper\ninside the test sample. Multifrequency testing has been there-\nfore employed.\nB. Coil Impedance\nThe physical principle for electromagnetic induction prob-\nlems can be described as a diffusion equation in terms of\n0018-9456\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nMA AND PEYTON: EDDY CURRENT MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND POROSITY OF METAL FOAMS 571\nFig. 1. Normalized impedance curves for planar circular coil varying with\nreference numbers r\/\u03b4 (coil radius\/skin depth) and lift-off (coil-to-sample\nspacing).\nmagnetic vector potential A as given in a complex phasor\nnotation for the sinusoidal waveform excitation cases by\n\u22072A+ j\u03c9\u00b5\u03c3A = \u2212\u00b5J (2)\nwhere J denotes the source current density passing through\nthe excitation coil and \u03c9 is the angular frequency. This equa-\ntion describes the penetration of eddy currents into material.\nNaturally, the solution of A must account for the necessary\nboundary conditions between the coil geometry and test mate-\nrials. The electric field intensity E can be calculated through\nE = \u2212\u2202A\/\u2202t. The induced voltage in sensing coil is then\ncomputed by taking the line integral of the vector E around\nthe coil loop and the coil impedance thus obtained.\nThe normalized impedance analysis is widely preferred for\nthe analysis of eddy current signals in a complex-plane dia-\ngram. The normalized impedance is defined as the ratio of the\nmeasurement coil impedance due to the presence of the test\nobject and the coil impedance as measured in the air, which pro-\nvides the relative magnitude of eddy current signal with regards\nto background measurement. Dodd and Deeds [5] gave the\nanalytical solution to a circular coil of rectangular cross section\nabove a two-conductor plane. Fig. 1 illustrates the variations\nof real and imaginary impedance components for electrically\nconductive (nonmagnetic) materials under different values of\nreference number and lift-off (coil-to-sample spacing). The\nreference number is defined as r\/\u03b4, i.e., the ratio of mean coil\nradius r and skin depth. As is well known, the resistive (real)\ncomponent of the coil impedance is related to energy losses\ncaused by eddy currents within the test material. The magnetic\nfield set up by the eddy currents tends to weaken the energizing\ncoil field, thus lowering the value of the reactive (imaginary)\ncomponent. This finally results in a comma-shaped normalized\nimpedance diagram. As can be seen from this illustration, the\nreference number controls the data points shifting along the\ncurve. The effect of decreasing lift-off causes the impedance\ncurve to shrink, the smaller the value of lift-off, the closer the\nimpedance curve approaches to the empty coil impedance point\n(0, j). Apparently, the overall magnitude of eddy current signal\nis lift-off dependent, which means the magnitude is dependent\non the test geometry. However, the phase angle \u03b8 is virtually\nlift-off invariant, which means phase signature is only depen-\ndent on the sample under test.\nLibby [6] also reported the analytical solution to an infinitely\nlong solenoid encircling a long cylindrical conductor within it.\nThe comma-shaped loci, as shown in Fig. 1, also apply to eddy\ncurrent sensing using solenoidal coils, where it is the reference\nnumber r\u221a\u03c9\u00b5\u03c3 and fill-factor that determine the variation of\nimpedance curves. The fill-factor is defined as the ratio of the\nradii of test object and sensing coil. The fill-factor governs the\neffectiveness of the coupling energy into the test object, which\naffects the impedance loci in a same way as the lift-off effect\ndoes in cases of planar coils.\nC. Equivalent Electrical Conductivity\nThe phase signature lift-off invariance is significant in that it\nindicates the existence of a relationship between phase angle\n\u03b8 and the reference number. For the block and sandwich-\nshaped samples under test using planar pancake coils, a linear\nrelationship has been observed between the cotangent of the\nphase angle and the reference number r\/\u03b4 through a least\nsquare fit to the measured data of bulk materials [7]\ncot \u03b8 = b+ a\nr\n\u03b4\n. (3)\nThe electrical conductivity of the material \u03c3 is thus solved in\nthe value of\n\u03c3 =\n(cot \u03b8 \u2212 b)2\n\u03c0\u00b5a2r2f\n. (4)\nThe values of parameters a and b in (3) and (4) are applica-\ntion dependent mainly on the coil sensor geometry and can be\ncalibrated using the measurement data of bulk materials.\nFor the cylindrically shaped samples under test using\nsolenoidal coils, the relationship can be described parametri-\ncally by expressing the reference number and phase angle \u03b8\nalone as\n1\nr\n\u221a\n\u03c9\u00b5\u03c3\n= X(\u03b8). (5)\nThe electrical conductivity \u03c3 can be evaluated using the\nprecalculated values of X(\u03b8) by\n\u03c3 =\n1\n\u03c9\u00b5 (rX(\u03b8))2\n(6)\nwhere X(\u03b8) can be calibrated based on the impedance curves\nof bulk materials as their electrical conductivity \u03c3 is already\nknown.\nD. Porosity Evaluation\nThe mean porosity \u03be of foam is defined as (1\u2212 \u03c1\/\u03c1s) (%),\nwhere \u03c1\/\u03c1s is the relative density defined as the density of\n572 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT, VOL. 55, NO. 2, APRIL 2006\nfoam \u03c1 divided by the density of solid \u03c1s of which it is made.\nActually, the mean porosity can be obtained by weighting the\nfoam and then dividing the weight of foam by that of solid in\npercentage with the same external dimensions. For closed-cell\nfoams, the electrical conductivity is connected with porosity\n(relative density) for porous metal foams in the following\nrelationship [8], which takes into account the fact that the\nequivalent electrical conductivity decreases with the increase\nin porosity\n\u03c3 =\n2K(1\u2212 \u03be)\n2K + \u03be\n\u03c3s (7)\nwhere \u03c3s is the electrical conductivity of solid, K is a constant\ndetermined by cell shape, and K = 0.3403 when the cell shape\nis spherical. Thus, if the equivalent conductivity is known, the\nmean porosity of the foams can be estimated through\n\u03be =\n0.6806(\u03c3s \u2212 \u03c3)\n\u03c3 + 0.6806\u03c3s\n. (8)\nIII. METALLIC FOAMS AND COIL DESIGNS\nA. Aluminum Foams\nSandwich-shaped and rod-shaped foams with a closed-cell\nstructure were investigated in the measurements. Sandwich-\nshaped foams were manufactured using CaCO3 as the foaming\nagent [9], which were produced using an Al\u2013Si alloy with\n10 vol.% of SiC particles (13 \u00b5m in size) as a stabilizer. Three\nsuch foams were used as test samples, each having a size of\n47.0 mm \u00d7 42.7 mm, but 4.5, 9.2, and 14.6 mm in thickness,\nrespectively. The sandwich-shaped foams under test all have a\nporosity of approximately 85% and a pore size of about 1.5 mm.\nIn addition, two commercial foams were used in the testing.\nAlporas foam has a surface area of 149.9 mm \u00d7 100.1 mm and\n10.5 mm in thickness, whereas Cymat foam has a surface area\nof 102.4 mm \u00d7 49.7 mm and 53.0 mm in thickness. They have\napproximately same porosity of about 90% but with different\npore sizes (3 mm for Alporas and 6 mm for Cymat foam).\nRod-shaped foams were produced by a powder route [1].\nTwo aluminum rod foams with different porosities were used as\nthe rod-shaped samples. The porosities by weight are 71.83%\nand 80.41% for rod foam 1 and rod foam 2, respectively. Both\nfoams are 10 mm in diameter and 200 mm in length and have a\npore size of around 1.0 mm.\nB. Coil Geometries\nTwo types of sensor coils have been constructed purposely\nto accommodate different shaped samples, which are based on\nplanar pancakes and solenoidal windings. Planar pancakes are\nused to inspect block and sandwich foams, whereas solenoids\nare used to test cylindrically shaped rod samples. Fig. 2 shows\nthe PCB pancake coil and solenoidal winding geometries,\nrespectively, used for the applications, where the geometry\nparameters are described in Table I. In practical measurements,\ndouble-coil arrangements are preferred, where one coil is used\nfor excitation purposes with a separate secondary coil used for\nFig. 2. Coil sensors used in the applications. (Left) Planar pancake coils.\n(Right) Solenoidal sensor.\nTABLE I\nPARAMETERS OF SENSOR GEOMETRY\nsensing. The excitation coil is used to generate a fluctuating\nmagnetic field whereas the sensing coil, placed concentrically\nwith the excitation coil, is used to detect the perturbation of\nthe primary field resulting from the presence of test sample.\nThe resonant frequency of the sensor is in the region of\n2 and 3 MHz for solenoidal and pancake coils, respectively.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nA Solartron SL 1260 impedance analyzer was used in the\ntests, which can supply a sinusoidal signal with variable fre-\nquencies to the excitation coil of the sensor. The analyzer\nrecorded the ratios of the induced voltage across the sensing\ncoil and the current flowing through the excitation coil, obtain-\ning real and imaginary parts of the gain and phase of the transfer\nMA AND PEYTON: EDDY CURRENT MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND POROSITY OF METAL FOAMS 573\nFig. 3.

Coil impedance measurements in the\nair were first made to normalize impedance calculations.\nThe selection of an effective operation frequency range is\nnormally critical, and this depends largely on the coil configu-\nration and the properties of the foam samples. The selection of\nlower operating frequency is largely dependent on the thickness\nor radius of the test sample and is limited by signal to noise\nperformance of the measurement system due to the inductive\nnature of the sensor. The electromagnetic skin depth at this\nfrequency should be comparable with the thickness or radius\nof the sample to ensure that a sufficient volume of material is\nprobed. Lowering further the test frequency reduces the effec-\ntiveness of the coupling energy into the test object considerably,\nthus resulting in low sensitivity measurements. In contrast, the\nupper operating frequency should be selected at which the\nelectromagnetic skin depth exceeds the pore size of the foams\nso that the impact of pore size of the foams can be fully\nconsidered. The measurements can be made with a relatively\ngood accuracy at these intermediate frequencies ranging from\nthe selected lower frequency to the upper frequency. Take the\nsandwich foam with a thickness of 9.2 mm and a pore size\nof 1.5 mm as an example. Substituting \u03b4 = 9.2 mm into (1)\ngives a lower frequency of around 600 Hz, for instance, when\n\u03c3 = 5 MS\/m. Supposing a much lower conductivity of foams\ncompared to that of bulks, 1.5 kHz is selected as the lower\noperating frequency in practical calculations. Considering the\npore size of 1.5 mm of this foam, the upper operating frequency\nshould be in the region of 50 kHz, supposing the conductivity\nof the porous foam is lower than 3 MS\/m, which is obvi-\nously far less than the resonant frequency of 3 MHz of the\npancake coils.\nA. Sandwich-Shaped Foams\nSandwich-shaped foams were examined with the planar\npancake coil arrangement as shown in Fig. 2. As described\nearlier, impedance curves are highly affected by the lift-off.\nFig. 3 illustrates the variations of eddy current signal with lift-\noff and applied frequency in three-dimensional (3-D) form. In\nthis example, a sandwich foam 4.5-mm thickness is shown,\nwhich describes the responses of impedance magnitude and\nphase angle \u03b8 to both the coil-to-sample spacing ranging from\n1.5 to 10.5 mm and the overall swept frequencies between\n1.25 and 630 kHz applied at each distance. This demonstrates\nagain that impedance magnitude varies with the lift-off sig-\nFig. 4. Cotangent of phase angle against reference number (coil radius\/skin\ndepth) for a variety of bulk materials under pancake coils.\nnificantly; however, the phase signature is lift-off invariant.\nPhase signature is therefore interested in characterizing eddy\ncurrent signal as it is only related with the material under test\nas described earlier.\nThree solid aluminum sandwiches and three solid brass sand-\nwiches with similar sizes to the foams were tested to calibrate\nthe sensor coils as their electrical conductivity \u03c3 is already\nknown (\u03c3 = 37.67 MS\/m for aluminum and \u03c3 = 18.0 MS\/m\nfor brass). Fig. 4 gives the relationship between phase signa-\nture and reference number based on the measured data of\nbulk materials, where x-axis represents the reference number\nr\/\u03b4, which is proportional to the square root of operation\nfrequency, and y-axis as the cotangent of the phase angle.\nA straight-line relationship was observed between two para-\nmeters for different bulk materials with a variety of thickness.\nThis can be numerically fitted through a least square fit to\nthe measured data, obtaining a = 0.6932 and b = \u22120.5545 in\n(3). Hence, the calculation of electrical conductivity can be\nachieved in terms of (4), as shown in Fig. 5. In this group test,\nthe frequency range best suitable for the foam with the inter-\nmediate thickness (9.2 mm) as discussed earlier is taken as the\ncompromise, namely, the low and upper operating frequencies\n574 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT, VOL. 55, NO. 2, APRIL 2006\nFig. 5.

The values of equivalent\nconductivity of the foams by taking a mean value within this\neffective frequency range are about 2.28, 1.92, and 2.20 MS\/m,\nrespectively. The values of solid aluminum and brass are also\ndisplayed in the illustration as the reference in order to show\nthe relative magnitude of electrical conductivity of the foams.\nThe measured electrical conductivities of bulk aluminum and\nbrass are 35.62 and 18.40 MS\/m, respectively, which implies\nthat the measurement error is within 5%. Table II gives the\nvalues of porosity measured with the eddy current sensing\ntechnique in comparison with those obtained by weight. The\nmeasurement results for porosity are in good agreement with\nthose actual mean porosities measured by weight.\nNow consider the application of this sensing technique to\ncommercial Alporas and Cymat aluminum foams. A relatively\nlarge pancake coil sensor was constructed owing to the signif-\nicant increasing dimension of the foam samples. In fact, this\nlarge pancake coil sensor has the same test arrangement as the\npancake coils shown in Fig. 2 but with the geometry parameters\nbeing chosen as: PCB board size d = 125 mm, initial square\nd1 = 17 mm, final square d2 = 103 mm, and the number of\nexcitation\/sensing coil is 35 turns.

Values of electrical conductivity for commercial foams where the\neffective frequency range is between 250 Hz and 2.0 kHz.\nbased on the measured data of bulk materials is shown in Fig. 6,\nfrom which the parameters a = 0.4584 and b = \u22120.8819 are\nobtained. It is worth noting that a relatively lower frequency\n(250 Hz) was chosen in this case due to the relatively large\nthickness of these foams and, at frequencies below 250 Hz,\nthe measurement data became noisy because of the inductive\nnature of the sensor. Meanwhile, the value of upper frequency\n(2.0 kHz) is relatively small; this is mainly attributed to the\nlarge pore size that commercial foams have (3 mm for Alporas\nand 6 mm for Cymat foam). Fig. 7 shows the electrical conduc-\ntivity of foams under an effective operation frequency between\n250 Hz and 2.0 kHz. On this basis, the deduced equivalent\nconductivities are 3.48 and 2.395 MS\/m for Alporas and Cymat\nfoams, respectively. There is a relatively big difference between\nthe measurement porosities and the actual mean porosities for\nthe commercial foams as shown in Table II. The Alporas and\nCymat foams under test were found to have specific structures\nsuch as the same material coatings on the foam surfaces. This\nincreases the relative density of the test foams due to solid\nsurface, thus increasing the measured equivalent conductivity,\nwhich finally leads to the decreased mean porosities when\nMA AND PEYTON: EDDY CURRENT MEASUREMENT OF ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY AND POROSITY OF METAL FOAMS 575\nFig. 8.

These factors result in discrepancies\nof the measurement results.\nB.

(9)\nSubstituting X(\u03b8) into (6) enables the electrical conductivity to\nbe calculated.\nFig. 9 illustrates the conductivity curves within the effective\nfrequency range between 1.0 and 50.0 kHz, which are deter-\nmined by the radius of the foams and the pore size, respectively.\nValues of equivalent conductivity are finally computed as fol-\nlows: 5.10 MS\/m for rod foam 1, 3.55 MS\/m for rod foam 2,\n35.75 MS\/m for solid aluminum rod, and 16.5 MS\/m for solid\nbrass rod. Porosities of rod foams have been obtained from\na relationship between electrical conductivity and porosity as\ndescribed in (7) and (8), and are also in good agreement with\nthose obtained by weight as given in Table II.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis study has shown that eddy current techniques can\nbe effectively used to examine the electrical properties and\nfurther the structure of porous aluminum foams. Typical coil\nsensors (planar pancake coils and solenoidal windings) have\nbeen designed to accommodate the representative types of\nFig. 9. Values of electrical conductivity for rod foams and bulk materials,\nwhere the effective frequency range is between 1.0 and 50.0 kHz.\nsample shapes (sandwich-shaped and rod-shaped foams). It has\nbeen found that the phase-frequency response of the sensor\nis relatively immune to coil-to-sample spacing and fill-factor\nvariations, from which the equivalent electrical conductivity of\nthe sample can be determined. The equivalent conductivity can\nbe converted into structural parameters such as mean porosity.\nThe appropriate selection of an effective operation frequency\nrange is critical in achieving reliable results, which depends\nmainly on the coil configuration and the properties of the foam\nsample. The lower operating frequency should be selected at\nwhich the electromagnetic skin depth is comparable with the\nthickness or radius of the sample to ensure that a sufficient\nvolume of material is probed. The upper operating frequency\nshould be selected at which the electromagnetic skin depth\nexceeds the pore size of the foams so that the impact of pore size\nof the foams can be fully considered. The research has demon-\nstrated the potential of using this nondestructive testing tech-\nnique in characterizing and further recognizing the properties\nof metallic foams.\nFurther work includes analytical forward problem solution\nfor coil impedance change due to the presence of foams. The\nwork also includes metallic foam eddy current simulations\nusing the finite-element method to fully investigate the impact\nof the macrostructures of the foams on their electrical properties\nand further to establish a more accurate relationship between\nthe equivalent electrical conductivity and the mean porosity. It\nis believed that the application of eddy current sensing holds\nvery significant promise for the future industrial process in\nmetallic foams.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. V.
