Introduction \nApplying the principles of symmorphosis (Weibel, 2000) to the oxygen supply cascade \nprovides a conceptual framework to explain how temperature affects oxygen availability to \ntissues, and hence tissue energy status. This has developed towards a unifying principle that the \nphysiological thermal limits of aquatic ectotherms are defined by oxygen availability, the \nbalance between supply and demand (P\u00f6rtner, 2002; P\u00f6rtner, 2006; Peck et al., 2007). Within \ntheir optimal range ectotherms are expected to have the physiological flexibility to cope with \nnormally experienced seasonal variation and tissue energy status should be maximal. However, \nin the face of extreme conditions, or towards range limits, aerobic scope is reduced, as more of \nthe available energy is required to cope with routine metabolic processes and oxygen supply \nmechanisms become sub-optimal. There is growing evidence that the effects of thermal stress act \nhierarchically, from high to low complexity, i.e. whole body processes are affected before \nbiochemical reactions and cells (P\u00f6rtner, 2002; P\u00f6rtner and Knust, 2007; P\u00f6rtner et al., 2007). \nImproving our understanding of how functionality is lost and energy is partitioned between \nprocesses will improve our understanding of the likely impact of climate change on species \ndistributions and resulting ecosystem shifts. \nThermal sensitivity can be assessed at a number of levels from whole animal activity \nthrough to tissue energy status and finally mortality. Characterising changes in tissue \nbiochemistry has been developed as a test for critical thermal limits in aquatic ectotherms which \nindicate the transition to anaerobic metabolism (cf P\u00f6rtner, 2002). Within the window bounded \nby critical temperatures, an even narrower window is bordered by pejus limits (pejus: getting \nworse) which indicate when temperatures move beyond the optimal range and functionality starts \nto be lost, which is paralleled by a shortfall in oxygen supply and demand until critical limits are \nreached and anaerobic metabolic pathways are recruited. Species tested this way include the \nboreal freshwater gadoid, Lota lota (Hardewig et al., 2004), the worms, Sipunculus nudus \n(Zielinski and P\u00f6rtner, 1996), several populations of Arenicola marina (Sommer et al., 1997), \nand several Antarctic species (e.g. Limopsis marionensis; P\u00f6rtner et al., 1999) including both L. \nelliptica (Peck et al., 2002) and N. concinna (P\u00f6rtner et al., 1999). Biochemical parameters were \n 2\n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \nselected that measure the integrity of cellular systems and identify the temperature at which there \nis a departure from homeostasis (pHi and cCO2), with the main focus on those that measure the \naerobic status of the animal, circulation (heart rate), aerobic metabolism (O2 consumption and \ncitrate synthase activity), tissue energy status (balance of adenylates) and recruitment of \nanaerobic pathways (build up of organic acids). We aim to utilise these techniques to compare \npejus limits, critical and lethal limits of N. concinna and L. elliptica from different locations \nwithin the Antarctic. These measures will be used to look for adaptive differences between \nlocations that relate to experienced thermal environment. \nWe exploit access to a unique latitudinal gradient within the Southern Ocean, Rothera \n(67\u00b0S), Signy (60\u00b0S) and South Georgia, (54\u00b0S) which enable us to separate latitude and \ntemperature (Barnes et al. 2006). Our highest latitude site at Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, has \nan annual seawater temperature ranging from \u20132\u00b0C in winter to +1\u00b0C in the height of summer (at \n15m depth; Barnes et al., 2006). Signy Island, within the South Orkney Islands (60\u00b0C) is on the \nedge of the Weddell Sea gyre and despite its more northerly location has the same annual \nseawater temperature range to that of Rothera (Clarke and Leakey, 1996). However the sub-\nAntarctic Island of South Georgia (54\u00b0S), although still within the Southern Ocean (south of the \nAntarctic circum-polar current) and therefore the biological Antarctic (Barnes et al., 2005), has \nalmost twice the annual range due to a higher summer maximum (\u20131 to +4\u00b0C at 10-20m; Barnes \net al., 2006). In response to the constant cold at Rothera benthic marine ectotherms are generally \nstenothermal, they have a limited temperature range, upper lethal limits typically occurring \nbetween 5 and 10\u00baC (Peck, 2005) but for some species are considerably lower than these, e.g. the \nbrittle star Ophionotus victoriae which cannot survive even 1 month at 2\u00b0C (Peck et al, in press). \nFurthermore, limits for critical activities are often considerably lower than the lethal limits (2 to \n4\u00baC; Peck et al., 2004). The +4\u00b0C maximum summer seawater temperature at South Georgia \ntherefore has the potential to impact these species, unless they have adaptive capacity to cope \nwith this thermal range. It is interesting to note that the range of O. victoriae does not stretch as \nfar as South Georgia.  \nSymmorphosis (Weibel, 2000) and the climate variability hypothesis (Stevens, 1989) \nboth predict that species, which experience a wider range of temperature, will have greater \nthermal flexibility. From this, sub-littoral species living at South Georgia should be able to cope \nwith higher temperatures than the same species from Rothera. Habitat temperatures would also \n 3\n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \npredict that the thermal response of individuals from Signy would be closer to those from \nRothera than South Georgia. Although littoral species will experience a much higher range of \ntemperatures during low water emersion, habitat temperatures still predict the warmest \nenvironment at South Georgia. The highest recorded littoral temperature is 12.3\u00b0C at Rothera \n(Waller et al., 2006), 10.7\u00b0C at Signy (Barnes et al., 1996) and 15.8\u00b0C at South Georgia \n(Davenport, 1997). The littoral limpet, Nacella concinna (Strebel 1908), would therefore be \nexpected to have a higher thermal capacity than the sub-littoral clam, Laternula elliptica (King \nand Broderip 1831) and higher thermal limits in N. concinna and L. elliptica would be predicted \nfrom South Georgia, than Signy and Rothera. However, species living at their range limit, where \nthey experience temperatures close to their maxima may have a reduced ability to cope with \nfurther temperature increases (Tomanek, 2005; Deutsch et al., 2008); adaptations that enable \nectotherms to live in warmer environments may occur at the expense of further acclimatory \ncapacity (Stillman, 2003). \nThrough sampling these two species from 3 locations within the Southern Ocean, at the \nsame time of year, we aim to conduct the first latitudinal comparison of thermal tolerance within \nthe Southern Ocean. Environmental history determines thermal response (e.g.. Osovitz and \nHofmann, 2005) and so all animals were acclimated to the same temperature (0.0\u00b0C) and \nmaintained under as near identical conditions as possible for 2 months before thermal responses \nwere tested. Any differences in thermal response should therefore indicate adaptive differences \nbetween locations. \n \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1. Collection and culture \nLimpets, Nacella concinna and the soft shelled clam, Laternula elliptica were collected \nduring cruise JR109 on the RRS James Clark Ross and concurrently at Rothera, the British \nAntarctic Survey Research Station at Adeleide Island on Antarctic Peninsula, during early \nsummer as detailed in table 1. Except for N. concinna from Signy, which were collected from the \nlowest part of the intertidal, all animals were collected by SCUBA divers. \nAfter collection all animals were maintained in recirculating aquaria at 0.0\u00b10.3\u00b0C, for 63 \ndays until the start of experiments. Water quality was maintained through biological filtration, \nU.V. sterilisation, protein skimmers and daily water changes. During this period animals were \n 4\n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \nnot fed to reduce any metabolic increment due to feeding (SDA), which can last up to 25 days in \nAntarctic benthic ectotherms (Peck, 1998). Nonetheless, N. concinna were observed grazing on \nbiofilms on the tank walls and L. elliptica were seen with siphons open, so both species are likely \nto have continued low level feeding. \nAt the start of incubation experiments animals were transferred to two 200 litre jacketed \nacrylic tanks (Engineering Design and Plastics, Cambridge, Cambs.) attached to LTD20G \nthermocirculators (Grant instruments Ltd, Shepreth, Cambs.), which maintained temperatures to \nan accuracy of \u00b10.2\u00b0C. The method was similar to that that used by Morley et al. (2007) and \nPeck et al. (2002; 2004; 2007 and 2008). Animals were allowed 48 hours to recover from \nmovement stress before temperatures were altered or measurements taken. Temperature was then \nraised at approximately 0.1\u00b0C per hour until the required temperatures were reached and then \nanimals were allowed 48 hours to recover from any metabolic overshoot (Peck et al., 2002). Due \nto time constraints animals were separated into two groups, which were taken through different \n5.0\u00b0C temperature steps, tank 1) 0.0, 5.1 and 10.0\u00b0C, tank 2) 2.5, 7.5 and 12.5\u00b0C. Following this \nprotocol animals were tested over approximately 3 weeks in each tank. \n \n2.2. Oxygen consumption \nRoutine metabolic rate was measured in closed cell respirometers, following the \nmethodology of Peck (1989), except that oxygen concentration was measured with a Fibox-3 \noxygen meter (Presens GmbH, Regensberg, Germany; e.g. Morley et al., 2007). Oxygen \nsensitive foils were calibrated before each measurement using 5% w\/w sodium diothionite for \n0% and fully aerated water for 100%. During trials oxygen concentration was not allowed to fall \nbelow 70% of air saturation, which is above the threshold for oxy-regulation for L. elliptica \n(Peck et al., 2002). Two empty chambers (controls) were run with each trial to account for \nbackground oxygen consumption, which was routinely less than 10% of the animal\u2019s \nconsumption. The basal metabolic rate of 4-5 individuals was measured for three consecutive \ndays after which data were analysed for significant differences in oxygen consumption between \ndays. When significant differences were found, daily measurements continued until three stable \nreadings were obtained and then temperature was raised. The volume of each animal was \nmeasured through displacement and subtracted from the volume of water in the respirometer. At \nthe end of the experiment dry weight (constant weights at 60\u00b0C) and ash free dry weight (dry \n 5\n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \nweight minus the weight of ash remaining after ignition at 475\u00b0C for 24h) of each whole animal \nwas measured.  \nAt each temperature the circulatory system of L. elliptica was monitored with the \nimpedance-based heart rate monitoring system (Buchan et al., 1988). Impedance systems record \nthe frequency of heart rate through variations in resistance between two electrodes. Methods \nused were similar to those of Peck et al. (2002). Two 1-mm holes were drilled through the shell \neither side of the heart, and 2mm of tinned 18 standard gauge copper wire electrodes, with the \ncoating removed from the tips, were inserted and glued in place with cyanocrylate gel adhesive. \n4 Signy and 4 Rothera L. elliptica had electrodes implanted in each of the two temperature tanks.  \nAt the end of each temperature step the foot muscle from 4 animals was freeze clamped \nin liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C for biochemical analysis at the Alfred Wegener Institute in \nGermany (except South Georgia and Signy N. concinna at 10\u00b0C for which only 3 animals were \navailable). Foot muscle was the chosen tissue as it performs a similar function in both N. \nconcinna and L. elliptica. Tissue was ground in a pestle and mortar, under liquid nitrogen, and a \nnumber of extracts produced for biochemical analysis.  \nTemperature steps continued until 50% mortality occurred in the tanks. A further set of \n20 N. concinna and L. elliptica from each location was maintained in the flow through aquarium, \nat ambient temperature, for the duration of the experiment, with no mortalities.   \n \n2.3. Biochemical analysis \nIntracellular pH (pHi) and cCO2 could only be measured in tissues of L. elliptica as N. \nconcinna foot muscle has large calcium carbonate stores, which would interfere with \nhomogenate acidity (P\u00f6rtner et al., 1999). Extracts were prepared in a media containing \n160mmol.l-1 potassium fluoride and 1.0 mmol.l-1 nitrilotriacetic acid following the methods of \nP\u00f6rtner et al. (1990). pHi was measured in the supernatant of the centrifuged homogenates at \nanimal incubation temperature, using needle type fibre optic pH sensors attached to a pH1 micro \npH meter (Presens GmbH. Regensburg, Germany) whose analogue output signal was boosted \nand digitised through a Powerlab system (AD instruments). Due to the high sensitivity of the \noptode system to solution ionic strength, KCl was added to each calibration buffer to match L. \nelliptica tissue ionic strength of 0.16mol L-1. Due to the small change in tissue pH, calibration \nwas conducted using three buffers covering the pH range 6.865 to 7.413 (at 25\u00b0C) whose pH \n 6\n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \nchange with temperature had already been calculated. pH sensors were re-calibrated using \nbuffers cooled to each incubation temperature.  \nTo measure cCO2 100\u00b5l of this supernatant extract was injected into a 10ml sealed \nsample vial, containing 1.5ml of nitrogen gassed HCl (0.05M). The sample was rotated for 10 \nminutes and then 50\u00b5l of this gas phase was injected into an Agilent technologies 6890N \nNetwork gas chromatogram through a G1888 network headspace sampler. cCO2 was measured \nwith a HP-PLOTQ column and a TCD detector. Triplicate peak areas were converted to cCO2 by \nplotting a calibration curve for standard samples between 0.5 mM and 10.0 mM dissolved \ninorganic carbon (r2 =0.998).  \nTissue citrate synthase activity was measured from tissue extract at a ratio of 1g of tissue \nto 9ml of extraction buffer, following the methods of Sidell et al. (1987). Enzyme activity was \nmeasured at animal incubation temperature with a Beckman UV-DU 7400 spectrophometer \nfitted with a temperature controlled cuvette holder and diode array detector.  \nTo measure both the build up of the end products of anaerobic metabolism (organic \nacids) and tissue energy status (the adenylates) tissue homogenate was prepared using 0.6mol.l-1 \nperchloric acid (PCA) (modified from Hardewig et al., 1998). Diluted PCA extracts were \ninjected into an ICS 2000 ion chromatography system fitted with a Gilson Diluter 401 \nautosampler. Organic acids were separated on an ion exclusion column (Dionex ICE-AS 1) at \n60\u00b0C fitted with an AMMS-ICE 4mm micro-membrane suppressor cell, with 0.20mM \nheptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) as eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml.min-1 and 5mM \ntetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) as the regenerant. The signal was detected on a DS6 \nconductivity detector. Duplicate sample peaks were converted into concentrations using \ncalibration curves with standard solutions, succinate (12 \u00b5M to 212 \u00b5M, r2 =0.997) acetate \n(14\u00b5M to 296\u00b5M, r2 =0.997) and propionate (12 \u00b5M to 189\u00b5M, r2 = 0.999).  \nAdenylates were measured on a Beckman PACE\/MDQ capillary electropheris system \nfollowing the adapted methods of Casey et al. (1999). The capillary was uncoated fused silica, \n50\u00b5m ID, 50 cm long. The pH of homogenates was set to 9.5, diluted in separation buffer \n(40mM tetraborate buffer and 10mM sodium chloride (pH 9.7)) and 50\u00b5l of 4 mM uric acid was \nadded to 200\u00b5l of each standard and sample as an internal standard. The absorbance signals of \nseparation were simultaneously detected at different wavelengths with a photo diode array \ndetector: at 254 nm, adenosine, AMP, ATP, ADP and ITP; at 200 nm, arginine and PLA; at 290 \n 7\n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \nnm, internal standard uric acid.

Analysis \nConducting the experiment in two tanks simultaneously created a mixed design where, \nwithin tanks, some individuals were sampled more than once (e.g. for oxygen consumption), but \ndifferent individuals were sampled between tanks. As there was a small, non significant, effect of \nindividual (as a random factor in a GLM analysis) a simple analyses was conducted, ignoring \nrepeated observations on some individuals (P. Rothery, pers. coms.). ANOVAS with Tukey post-\nhoc tests were used to test for differences between locations and temperatures for each species. \nWhere ANOVAS indicated only significant differences between locations a separate analysis \nwas conducted for each location. Signficant differences was accepted as P<0.05 throughout. \nOxygen consumption was standardised to that of a 0.373g dry mass N. concinna and a 10.6g dry \nmass L. elliptica (the mean mass of animal used) using scaling coefficients of 0.82 (Fraser et al., \n2002) and 0.73 (Peck et al., 2002) respectively.  \n \n3. Results \n3.1. Animal size \nThe shell length of L. elliptica sampled for biochemistry was not significantly different \nbetween locations, table 2. However, due to logistic constraints on collections by SCUBA divers, \nlimpets from Rothera were smaller than those from Signy and South Georgia. N. concinna \ncollected inter-tidally from Signy were not significantly different in size than N. concinna \ncollected sub-tidally from South Georgia.  \n \n3.2. L. elliptica \nMore than 50% of L. elliptica died during the transition from 5.0 to 10\u00b0C and from 7.5 to \n12.5\u00b0C so the experiment was stopped at this stage and the upper thermal limit recorded as \nbetween 7.5 and 10.0\u00b0C. Although the sample size was too small to detect significant effects, \n 8\n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \nheart rate increased with temperature between 0.0 and 5.1\u00b0C. 50% of animals with implanted \nimpedance wires died at 7.5\u00b0C so heart rate was not measured at this temperature.  \nTemperature had a significant effect on every biochemical parameter, there were a few \nsignificant differences between Rothera and Signy L. elliptica (Table 3) and some consistent \npatterns that indicate differences between L. elliptica from the two locations. Although generally \nnot significant, at 0.0\u00b0C, Rothera L. elliptica had higher oxygen consumption, CS activity and \nhigher concentrations of high energy phosphates (PLA, ITP and ATP) than Signy L. elliptica \nsuggesting an overall higher metabolism at 0.0\u00b0C. Between 0.0 and 2.5\u00baC there was also a, non-\nsignificant, but consistently greater magnitude change in PLA and ATP (reduction), cCO2 \n(increase) and organic acids (increase of succinate and acetate) in Rothera than Signy L. elliptica \n(Fig 1, Table 3).  \nThe oxygen consumption of L. elliptica rose between 0.0 and 2.5\u00b0C for specimens from \nboth sites, but no oxygen consumption was significantly different from that at 0.0\u00b0C. There was, \nhowever, a significant drop in oxygen consumption between 2.5 and 7.5\u00b0C for both Signy and \nRothera L. elliptica. Citrate synthase activity at 2.5, 5.1 and 7.5\u00b0C was not significantly different \nfrom that at 0.0\u00b0C. However, in a similar fashion to oxygen consumption, L. elliptica from both \nlocations had a peak in enzyme activity at 2.5\u00b0C, which was significantly higher than activity at \nboth 5.1 and 7.5\u00b0C.  \nThe energy status of the high energy phosphates fell as the concentration of their low \nenergy forms, arginine, AMP and ADP, increased at 7.5\u00b0C in L. elliptica from both locations. \nPLA the buffer that allows rapid rephosphorylation of ADP yielding ATP was also reduced at \n7.5\u00baC. The response of the triphosphates, ITP and ATP, to temperature was slightly different \nbetween L. elliptica from Signy and Rothera. The ATP levels of Rothera L. elliptica were lower \nat both 5.1 and 7.5\u00b0C than at 0.0\u00b0C, whilst the ATP levels of Signy L. elliptica were only \nreduced at 7.5\u00b0C. The ITP concentration of Rothera L. elliptica generally fell upon warming but \nwas only significantly lower than 0.0\u00b0C at 7.5\u00b0C, whilst the ITP concentration of Signy L. \nelliptica was lower at both 0.0\u00b0C and 7.5\u00b0C than 5.1\u00b0C.  \nThe concentration of all three organic acids, succinate, acetate and propionate was \nelevated at 2.5\u00b0C in Rothera L. elliptica and at 5.0\u00b0C in both, but was only significantly higher at \n7.5\u00b0C. There were no significant differences in acetate and propionate accumulation patterns \n 9\n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \nbetween locations except that succinate rose to a significantly higher level in Signy than Rothera \nL. elliptica at 7.5\u00b0C.  \nIntracellular pH was significantly higher at 0\u00b0C than at 2.5, 5.1 or 7.5\u00b0C for L. elliptica \nfrom both locations. There was also a significant drop in pHi between 5.1 and 7.5\u00b0C. Tissue \ncCO2 was highly variable and there was only one significantly elevated value, in Rothera L. \nelliptica at 5.1\u00b0C.  \n \n3.3. N. concinna \nMore than 50% of N. concinna died during the transition from 7.5 to 12.5\u00b0C and 10.0 to \n15.0\u00b0C so the experiment was stopped at this point. There was no significant effect of location or \ntemperature on arginine but there were complex, significant effects on the other adenylates, with \nhigher concentrations of both low (AMP and ADP) and high (ATP) energy adenylates at 10.0\u00b0C \n(Fig. 2). At 10.0\u00b0C AMP was significantly higher in Rothera N. concinna than all treatments \nexcept Signy N. concinna at 2.5\u00b0C and South Georgia at 10.0\u00b0C. At 10.0\u00b0C ADP was higher in \nN. concinna from all locations. Although there was no significant difference in ATP \nconcentration from that at 0.0\u00b0C, at 10.0\u00b0C the concentration of ATP was higher at all locations \nthan at 2.5\u00b0C. However, despite this significant increase in ATP for all locations, the increase for \nSouth Georgia N. concinna appeared to be less (Fig. 2). The PLA concentration of South Georgia \nN. concinna was also lower at 10.0\u00b0C than at either 0.0 or 5.1\u00b0C.  \nDespite a general increase in the organic acids with increasing temperature, succinate, \nacetate and proprionate were only significantly elevated in South Georgia N. concinna at 10.0\u00b0C \n(Fig.3). The large inter-individual variation in organic acids at 10\u00b0C is typical of biochemical \nresponses around physiological limits as some individuals reach their limits before others. For N. \nconcinna from all locations, citrate synthase activity determined in tissue samples collected at \neach temperature generally increased upon warming but was only significantly higher at 7.5 and \n10.0\u00b0C (Fig.4).  \nOxygen consumption was very different between N. concinna from different locations. \nOxygen consumption increased in a linear fashion with temperature (T) for Rothera (O2cons = \n0.14T +1.58, R2=0.27, p<0.05, F=6.8) and Signy (O2cons = 0.10T +0.92, R2=0.57, p<0.01, \nF=22.9) N. concinna (Fig 4). Oxygen consumption for South Georgia N. concinna reached a \nsimilar maximum value but was best described by a curvilinear relationship (O2cons = 0.64T \u2013 \n 10\n0.06T2 + 0.76, R2=0.45, p<0.01, F=6.6). The calculated maximum (the point of inflexion of the \ndifferential equation) occurred at 5.3\u00baC, but the highest oxygen consumption was recorded at \n2.5\u00baC (Fig. 4).  \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n \n4. Discussion \nMeasuring a suite of physiological and biochemical parameters gave a comprehensive \npicture of how tissue energy status changed in response to a 5.0\u00b0C per week temperature \nelevation. It also allowed comparisons of the responses of L. elliptica, and N. concinna, collected \nfrom different geographic locations. As all animals were collected at the same time, were held \nunder nearly identical conditions for approximately 2 months before thermal sensitivity was \ntested and they were tested over a maximum of 3 weeks, any consistent differences between \nlocations are most likely due differences in response between animals from these locations.  \n \n4.1. L. elliptica \nThe critical limit, which was confirmed by a drop in oxygen consumption, a drop in \nenergy status of the adenylates, an increase in anaerobic end products of metabolism (the organic \nacids) and a drop in intracellular pH, occurred between 5.1 and 7.5\u00b0C, which is comparable to \nthat measured previously, over a similar rate of temperature change (6\u00b0C; Peck et al., 2002). \nAnaerobic metabolism is generally considered one of the protective mechanisms that allow time-\nlimited survival above critical temperatures (P\u00f6rtner, 2006). However, molluscs in particular can \nhave high anaerobic capacities that can be utilised to survive hypoxia for days or weeks, \nparticularly when accompanied by metabolic depression (e.g. Holmes and Miller, 2006; Morley \net al., 2007; Long et al., 2008). Reductions in citrate synthase activity and metabolic rate suggest \nthat thermal limitation may have started at a lower temperature, with pejus limits below 5.1\u00b0C. \nSuccinate and volatile fatty acid formation set in somewhat earlier in Rothera than the Signy L. \nelliptica. This would indicate that, as a consequence of severe oxygen limitation, the critical \ntemperature is lower in the Rothera than the Signy population. The greater, but non-significant, \nbiochemical changes between 0.0 and 2.5 \u00baC for Rothera L. elliptica, coupled with significant \naccumulation of carbon dioxide in the haemolymph, which shows that Rothera L. elliptica have a \nlower capacity for gas exchange at 5.0 \u00baC (cf Peck et al., 2002), also suggest that pejus limits are \nlower in Rothera than Signy L. elliptica. After 2 months at 0.0 \u00baC, there were also signs of \n 11\n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \ndifferences in cold acclimation of; CS activity, oxygen consumption and the turnover of high \nenergy phosphates were consistently (but not significantly) higher in Rothera than Signy L. \nelliptica at 0.0 \u00baC.  \nThe lethal limit in the current study also occurred at a similar temperature, between 7.5 \nand 10.0\u00b0C (within 15 days), to that recorded previously (9\u00b0C within 25 days; Peck et al., 2002). \nThe similarity of lethal limits between Rothera and Signy L. elliptica, is consistent with the \nhypothesis that thermal capacities will be matched to the experienced environment (both -2 to \n+1\u00b0C), although the lower pejus limits of Rothera L. elliptica compared to Signy indicate subtle \ndifferences in thermal tolerance between locations. Clearly, studies incorporating L. elliptica \nfrom South Georgia, which is at the northern limit of its range, are needed to quantify how close \nit is living to its upper thermal limits and therefore with reduced capacity to cope with further \ntemperature increases (Stillman, 2003).  Such studies are crucial to our understanding of species \nwide thermal capacity and therefore the ability of species to cope with environmental change. \nAcclimations of L. elliptica at 3-4\u00b0C would indicate if South Georgia L. elliptica have \nadaptations to cope with higher maximum experienced summer temperature.  \n \n4.2. N. concinna \nDue to the constraints on geographical sampling within the Southern Ocean, there were \nsampling differences between N. concinna collected at different locations. N. concinna were \ncollected from the bottom of the inter-tidal from Signy, compared to sub-tidal animals collected \nfrom South Georgia and Rothera, however, all N. concinna were collected from depths shallower \nthan 6m. A recent study found small, non-consistent, genetic differences between inter-tidal and \n15m N. concinna from Potter Cove, King George Island, but not between inter-tidal and 6m N. \nconcinna (de Aranzamendi et al., 2008). Different biochemical responses to emersion were also \nevident between 15m and intertidal N. concinna, also from King George Island (Weihe and \nAbele, In Press) was also evident This suggests that comparisons of 6m (Rothera), 2-3m (South \nGeorgia) and inter-tidal (Signy) N. concinna will not be affected by population differences \nbetween animals collected from different depths. N. concinna collected in the middle of summer \nand tested within days of collection had no significant (t=0.57, p=0.57) differences in upper \nlethal thermal limits (1\u00b0C  per day) between those collected in the inter-tidal (11.6\u00b0C) or sub-\ntidal (6m, 10.8\u00b0C; SAM, unpublished data). The lack of any clear differences between Rothera \n 12\nsub-tidal and Signy inter-tidal N. concinna, in the present study suggests that they respond \nsimilarly to temperature, after a 2 month acclimation to 0.0\u00b0C.  \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \nRothera N. concinna were also smaller than those from the other two locations, which \ncould introduce complicating factors due to growth and age differences as well as wider thermal \nwindows of small specimens (e.g. P\u00f6rtner 2002; Peck et al., 2007; Gsottbauer et al., 2007). \nHowever, broad scale metabolic differences (see below), in the response to temperature, were \nfound between South Georgia and both Signy and Rothera N. concinna, which are unlikely to be \ncaused by size differences. Accepting these caveats, the present geographic comparisons within \nthe Southern Ocean, show for the first time specific responses of the adenylates, organic acids \nand oxygen consumption to temperature, which suggest differences in critical limits and the \nmetabolic mechanisms employed to cope with acute temperatures close to these limits. There \nwas little evidence to suggest that Rothera or Signy N. concinna were temperature limited over \nthe range 0.0 to 10.0\u00b0C with measures of aerobic metabolism (oxygen consumption, citrate \nsynthase activity and ATP concentration) all increasing with temperature above 2.5\u00b0C. This \ncontrasts strongly with the pattern in L. elliptica which didn\u2019t show a reduction in these metrics \nat temperatures above 2.5\u00b0C. This inicates they were suffering heat stress and have a narrower \nthermal window than N. concinna.  \nIn South Georgia N. concinna, citrate synthase activity and therefore the capacity of \naerobic metabolism in the mitochondria, increased with temperature in a similar fashion to \nlimpets from the other locations. However, in contrast to Rothera and Signy N. concinna, two \nindicators of metabolism decreased in South Georgia N. concinna at higher temperatures. \nOxygen consumption peaked somewhere between 2.5 and 5.3\u00b0C and then declined whilst the \nPLA pool, for buffering rapid ATP production, also declined above 5.1\u00b0C. Both of these suggest \na lower critical limit between 5.1 and 10.0\u00b0C (but perhaps as low as 2.5\u00b0C) for South Georgia N. \nconcinna, which was supported by the sharp increase in organic acids between 7.5 and 10.0\u00b0C \nand therefore the recruitment of anaerobic pathways.  \nThe wider thermal tolerance of N. concinna compared to L. elliptica is not surprising \nconsidering it ranges into the intertidal and can therefore be exposed to a more variable thermal \nenvironment. However, the difference in maximum littoral temperatures recorded so far, 12.3\u00b0C \nat Rothera (Waller et al., 2006) 10.7\u00b0C at Signy (Barnes et al., submitted) and 15.8\u00b0C at South \nGeorgia (Davenport, 1997) was not reflected in any difference in the upper lethal limits for N. \n 13\nconcinna from different locations after 2 months acclimation to 0.0\u00b0C (10.0 to 12.5\u00b0C). \nDavenport reported a short term survival limit of 15.6\u00b0C (12 hour exposure) for N. concinna at \nSouth Georgia, higher than our medium term, 22 day, temperature limit of between 10.0 and \n12.5\u00b0C. This is not unexpected as different thermal limits and protective mechanisms might be \nexpected if different rates of heating or cooling are used (Terblanche et al., 2007; Barnes et al., \n2008; Peck et al., in press). This difference may also have been because N. concinna tested by \nDavenport were acclimatised to summer conditions which could have raised their lethal limit \nabove that of animals acclimated to 0.0\u00b0C. However, it should also be noted that due to \nbehavioural adaptations, such as utilisation of cryptic habitats and evaporative cooling (Branch, \n1981), body temperatures of limpets in the field are unlikely to reach these temperatures. The \nmaximum foot temperature of a Rothera N. concinna exposed on a sunny day has been shown to \nbe 8.8\u00b0C, although the average was much lower, 3.3 to 3.8\u00b0C, ranging from 1.5 to 9.1\u00b0C below \nair temperature (Clark et al., 2008). If this relationship holds for South Georgia N. concinna then \nfoot temperature is unlikely to exceed their short-term (daily exposure) lethal limit during low \nwater emersion but might approach their medium term (weekly exposure) limit. Although N. \nconcinna are regularly exposed in the intertidal zone at Rothera and Signy, at South Georgia, it is \nmainly a sub-tidal species (Davenport, 1997) and only rarely found above mean low water spring \ntide level, reducing the risk of exposure to damaging high temperatures. The few inter-tidal \nindividuals found at South Georgia inhabit sheltered microhabitats and not exposed surfaces, \nwhich are colonised by a siphonariid limpet, Kerguelenella lateralis. At its northern geographic \nlimit differences in habitat utilisation may be key to reducing the likelihood of N. concinna being \nexposed to air temperatures close to its upper limit. They may therefore have evolved a high \nanaerobic capacity to allow short-term, passive, survival during less frequent exposure (P\u00f6rtner, \n2002). This fits with a growing body of evidence which shows that adaptation to life at range \nlimits may actually make animals less able to cope with further temperature increases (Stillman, \n2003, Tomanek, 2005, Deutsch et al., 2008).  \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \n433 \nThe passive survival strategy of N. conccina appears to be effective over several days, but \nis unlikely to be effective over longer time scales (P\u00f6rtner, 2006). After initial shock, animals \nmay switch from acute mechanisms that allow short-term \u201cpassive\u201d survival to longer-term \nacclimatory mechanisms with associated changes in tissue biochemistry and structure. The \ngreater thermal flexibility of N. concinna than L. elliptica was further evidenced by the increase \n 14\nin adenylate concentration with temperature which suggests that there was an acclimatory \nincrease of the adenylates over the 2 week duration of the experiment, in an attempt to meet the \nincrease in energy demand with temperature.  \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \nTwo month long incubations of N. concinna from South Georgia, Signy and Rothera, \nlong enough for seasonal acclimation, led to a reduction in the surface area of mitochondrial \ncristae per unit muscle fibre volume (Morley et al., submitted). Latitudinal comparisons showed \nthat acclimated N. concinna from South Georgia had a higher citrate synthase activity than \nRothera N. concinna, which was negatively correlated with mitochondrial density across \nlocations. This strongly suggested an adaptation for fewer, more efficient mitochondria in \nacclimated N. concinna from the northern limit of their range (Morley et al., submitted). Tissue \nsamples of N. concinna acclimated to 3.0\u00b0C are currently being analysed to investigate if \nchanges in aerobic pathways were accompanied by a change of anaerobic scope. These \ndifferences in the mechanisms underlying, and the limits of, thermal tolerance between N. \nconcinna from South Georgia and both Signy and Rothera N. concinna are supported by genetic \ndifferences, which suggest South Georgia N. concinna are a separate population (Beaumont and \nWei, 1991).  \nThe Scotia arc region of the Southern Ocean has one of the fastest warming climates on \nthe planet (Meredith and King, 2005). If this rate of warming is faster than the rate of \nevolutionary adaptation, then the acclimatory ability of individuals, populations and species is \nlikely to be a key determinate of their survival (e.g. Peck, 2008). Species with wider geographic \nranges are thought to be more resistant to extinction (Jablonski, 1986), which may in part be due \nto the wider range of environments they experience. This should in turn lead to wider genetic \nvariation and therefore an increased physiological capacity to cope with environmental \nperturbations (the climate variability hypothesis; Stevens, 1989). The current study has found \ndifferences in thermal response of marine ectotherms between locations on the Scotia Arc and \nAntarctic Peninsula. Investigations of a wider range of species will confirm if these differences \nare an adaptive response to differences in experienced environment. Latitudinal comparisons \ntesting for differences in capacity between animals from different locations within the Southern \nOcean could be a key tool for predicting the vulnerability of species to the current trend of \nwarming.  \n \n 15\nAcknowledgements 465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \nThis study was funded by NERC core funding to the BAS bioreach program and \nAntarctic Funding Initiative as well as by the MarCoPolI program of the AWI.
