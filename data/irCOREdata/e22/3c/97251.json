A discussion of the ill-posedness of the\npartial differential equation problem is included.\n1. Introduction. By using a random walk approach and assuming that the in-\ndividuals of a population have the same probability of moving from one point to\nanother, i.e., the habitat is isotropic, Skellam [38] derived the reaction-diffusion\nequation ut = D\u2207\n2u + g(u), for u(~r, t), the population density at the point ~r at\ntime t, where D > 0 and g is the net rate of growth. This model has been criti-\ncized (see [7], [16] and [39]) because it does not take into account, for instance, the\nnon-homogeneity of space and the different behavioral features of the individuals\nof the population. Several models have been proposed to take into account differ-\nent factors which determine the spatio-temporal distribution of populations within\ntheir habitat. Among these are positive density-dependent diffusion models which\ndescribe the avoidance of crowded areas by individuals of a population. This type\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

MAINI & JUDITH PE\u00b4REZ-VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nof behavior is well documented in the literature from both ecological and modeling\npoints of view (see [6], [25] and [28]). Some of these proposed models are degenerate\nin the sense that at some value of the population density the partial differential\nequation (PDE) degenerates into an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This\nleads to interesting phenomena when the traveling wave behavior is analyzed (see\n[36] and [37]).\nOn the other hand it is also known that individuals of a population can aggre-\ngate. The gregarious behavior of species is well documented in the literature. This\ncan be motivated by the need for survival, reproduction or to overcome a hostile\nenvironment, etc. Furthermore, this behavior can increase the animal\u2019s chance of\navoiding capture by a predator (see [32], [42] and [44] for instance). Attraction\nbetween individuals of the same species can occur in two different ways:\n1. Indirect. By this we mean the case in which a second agent produces (or\nfacilitates) some attractive substance, i.e., individuals can be attracted by\ndiffusing mediators produced from individuals of another species. Some au-\nthors have described the indirect aggregation phenomenon in terms of dif-\nferent taxis mechanisms, such as chemotaxis, phototaxis, etc., and they in-\ncorporate them in different ways into diffusive models. One example is the\nso-called chemotaxis-reaction-diffusion system (see [24], [40] and references\ntherein) which in one dimension, for the simple case where the individuals\n(with density u) produce their own attractant with concentration \u03c1, takes the\nform:\nut = [D1ux \u2212 u\u03c7(\u03c1)\u03c1x]x + f(u)\n\u03c1t = D2\u03c1xx + g(u, \u03c1),\n(1)\nwhere D1 and D2 are positive real numbers, \u03c7 is the chemotactic sensitivity\nfactor, f and g are the kinetic terms. Different spatial patterns (e.g. spiral\nwaves, traveling waves) have been predicted by analyzing the higher dimen-\nsional versions of these types of models ([13], [19], [24], and [40]), particularly,\nfor example, the aggregation of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum.\n2. Direct. Here the individuals of the species, due to social behavior (mating,\nsettlement, etc.) or defense against predators, etc., attract other individuals\nof the same species (conspecific). The purely aggregative phenomena have\nbeen studied by proposing different models. By way of example we address a\nfew of them:\nThe following diffusion-convection equation was proposed in [26]:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\nmum\u22121\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n+\u03a8\n(\u222b x\n\u2212\u221e\nu(s, t)ds\n)\n, u\n]\n, (2)\nwherem > 1, with initial condition u(x, 0) = u0(x) where u0 is a non-negative,\nbounded and integrable function on IR and \u03a8(r) is a smooth function in r.\nEcologically the second summand in the right hand side of equation 2 can\nbe interpreted as a dehomogenization process1 due to a transport process\nwhich depends upon the population density on the range from \u2212\u221e to the\npoint x. In addition to analyzing the existence and uniqueness of the solution\nfor this problem, the authors also proved the existence and the convergence\nof the solution to a solitary traveling wave as a pattern of aggregation of\nthe population. An intuitive understanding of why such solutions exist is as\n1By this we mean the opposite of a strictly diffusive process.\nDIRECT AGGREGATION AND TRAVELING WAVE DYNAMICS 457\nfollows: the spatial dynamics of the population is given by two factors: one\n(the diffusive) tends to homogenize, while the other (the convective) tends to\naggregate. Thus, as both are present as time increases one can suspect that\na balance among them could arise, leading to the solitary wave aggregation\nspatial pattern.\nA model which generalizes 2 is given by the partial-integro-differential equa-\ntion\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\nD(u)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n+\n\u222b\nIR\nK(u(x), s)u(x+ s)ds\n]\n, (3)\nwhere D is such that D(0) = 0 and a strictly positive function for all positive\nvalues of u, and K is an odd kernel. Different types of kernels having an\necological interpretation have been proposed (see [4]).\nIn [12] the authors use the Ginzburg-Landau free energy approach to derive\nthe fourth order diffusion equation:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\n\u03c7(u)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u00b5(u)\n\u22023u\n\u2202x3\n]\n, (4)\nwhere \u03c7(u) = (D1+3D2u\n2) is the attractivity coefficient and \u00b5(u) = D3 > 0.\nThe above equation takes into account long range diffusion. These authors\nhave shown that equation 4, with logistic growth, has spatially inhomogeneous\nsteady state solutions. Some extensions of this approach have been carried\nout (see [23]) to describe an aggregation phenomenon in a plant-herbivore\ninteraction.\nIn [9], the author assumes that competition between the individuals of a\nspecies (intra-specific) at a point depends not only on the population density\nat that point, but also on the weighted spatial average population density at\nneighboring points, given by,\nv(x, t) =\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n1\n2\nce\u2212c|x\u2212y|u(y, t)dy.\nThis leads to a modified logistic model with constant diffusion coefficient plus\nan equation for v, i.e., the system\nut = u[1 + \u03b1u\u2212 (1 + \u03b1)v] + uxx\n0 = c2(u\u2212 v) + vxx\n(5)\n\u2200 (x, t) \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e) \u00d7 IR+ with the initial conditions u(x, 0) = u0(x) and\nv(x, 0) = v0(x). The author states conditions on the positive parameters c\nand \u03b1 in 5 under which aggregation can occur.\nCantrell and Cosner (see, for example, [10] and [11]) have extensively\nworked on modeling spatial effects in ecology and population dynamics by\nusing reaction-diffusion models. In particular, concerning the aggregation\nprocess of a population with density u(x, t), these authors (see [10]) proposed\nand studied the following mathematical model\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2207 \u00b7 [d(x, u)\u2207u] + \u03bb\n[\nm(x)u \u2212 cu2\n]\nin \u2126\u00d7 (0,\u221e), (6a)\nu = 0 on \u2202\u2126\u00d7 (0,\u221e), (6b)\n458 FAUSTINO SA\u00b4NCHEZ-GARDUN\u02dcO, PHILIP K. MAINI & JUDITH PE\u00b4REZ-VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nwhere m(x) is a spatially varying local intrinsic growth rate, c measures the\nstrength of logistic self-limitation, the diffusivity d(x, u) depends on the popu-\nlation density and position, and \u03bb measures the ratio of the respective rates of\npopulation growth and dispersal throughout \u2126. The homogeneous Dirichlet\nboundary condition reflects the lethal character of the exterior. The tendency\nfor the population to aggregate is modeled by assuming that the diffusion\nrate remains strictly positive but at low densities decreases with population\ndensity. The model allows for the diffusion rate to increase in response to\novercrowding. The above authors give an example in which the model pre-\ndicts a type of conditional persistence analogous to that found in models with\nan Allee effect.\nIn the model of Cantrell and Cosner, however, since the population dy-\nnamics is assumed to be logistic, the effect is induced only because of the\naggregative density-dependent dispersal. This example is important because\nunlike non-spatial logistic models or logistic models augmented by dispersal\nvia passive diffusion their model can predict extinction for populations with\nlow initial densities but persistence for populations with high initial densities.\nThey hypothesize that a biological interpretation of the mechanism is as fol-\nlows: at low population densities individuals disperse rapidly and are likely to\nencounter the hostile exterior of their habitat, at slightly higher densities they\ndisperse less rapidly and thus experience reduced mortality due to dispersal\ninto hostile environments.\nIn [30] the author introduces a model for an aggregating population taking\nthe form\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\n\u03c6(u)\u2212 \u03bbf(u) + \u03bb\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n]\n+ f(u), (7)\nwhere the function \u03c6 determines the migration rate. Homogeneous Neumann\nboundary conditions are imposed for a bounded domain in IRn, and the case\nexamined is that where this migration function \u03c6 is bounded and non-negative\nand given by \u03c6(u) = u\u03c8(u) where, since 7 describes aggregating populations,\n\u03c8 is decreasing. A further requirement imposed is that f(u) = u\u03c3(u)describes\nthe Allee effect. Conditions on 7 for the survival (recovery) of a species in\ndanger of extinction can be given.\nStandard initial boundary value problems of the class\nut = \u2207\n2\u03c6(u) + f(u) (8)\nare ill-posed when \u03c6\u2032(u) is negative for positive values of u. In [30] the author\ndiscusses a way to overcome this difficulty by replacing 8 by\nut = \u2207\n2J + f(u), (9)\nwhere J(x, t) :=\n\u222b\n\u2126\nK(x, y)\u03c6(u(y, t))dy and K(x, y) is non-negative and zero\nflux boundary conditions on J are required in order to assure the isolation of\n\u2126.\nFor a particular choice of J it is shown that problem 9 is equivalent to 7\nwith its associated boundary conditions.\nOther approaches to deal with 8 being ill-posed for positive values of u\nhave been proposed. For example, in [29] a model for aggregating populations\nDIRECT AGGREGATION AND TRAVELING WAVE DYNAMICS 459\nwith migration rate \u03c8 and constant population is studied. The functional\ndifferential equation this author proposed is\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u22072 {\u03c8(u(x, [t\/\u03c4 ]\u03c4))u(x, t)} , (10)\nwith boundary conditions\n~n \u00b7 \u2207 {\u03c8(u(x, [t\/\u03c4 ]\u03c4))u(x, t)} = 0, x \u2208 \u2202\u2126, t > 0,\nwhere ~n is the normal vector at \u2202\u2126, \u2126 is a bounded domain in IRn and [\u03b8]\ndenotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \u03b8. Padro\u00b4n [29] assumed that\nthe density dependent dispersal coefficient \u03c8(u) gets actualized (up-dated)\nat certain pre-determined intervals of time, thus allowing them to overcome\npossible ill-posedness for the functional differential equation 10. He showed\nexistence and uniqueness for the initial value problem 10 (with associated\nboundary conditions), and discussed aggregating behavior exhibited by the\nsolutions.\nThe analysis of the classical mathematical problems (existence, uniqueness, con-\ntinuity with respect to initial conditions, etc.) for partial-integro-differential equa-\ntions such as 3 is a difficult task (see [5], [26] and [27] for instance). For this\nreason we suggest that the theory of diffusive models to describe aggregation can\nresult in an easier problem. This paper deals with this approach in order to de-\nscribe the direct aggregation phenomenon of individuals of one species living in a\none-dimensional habitat.\nThe possibility of describing such aggregative phenomena by using non-linear\nnegative degenerate diffusion equations has already been considered (see [4] and\n[7]). However, these authors do not provide any derivation of the negative diffusion\nequation, neither do they include any analysis. As far we know the first model\nwhich took into account the mutual attraction and repulsion of conspecifics was\nthat constructed by Taylor and Taylor [41]. Because of both the formalism in its\nderivation and its predictions, this model was criticized (see [3] and [42]). A more\nconsistent model was derived by Turchin (see [43]). He used a biased random walk\napproach to derive a model which is based on the following assumptions:\n1. When there are no other individuals at adjacent positions, each animal moves\nrandomly.\n2. If there is a conspecific at an adjacent position, the animal moves there with\nconditional probability k (conditioned on the presence of the other animal),\nor ignores the neighbor with conditional probability (1\u2212 k).\n3. When the local population density is low we can ignore the probability of\nhaving more than one conspecific in the immediate vicinity of each moving\nindividual.\nUnder these assumptions Turchin derived a model for a population with density\nu(x, t), of the form\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[(\u00b5\n2\n\u2212 2k(u)u\n) \u2202u\n\u2202x\n]\n, (11)\nwhere he then assumed that\nk(u) = k0\n(\n1\u2212\nu\n\u03c9\n)\n,\n460 FAUSTINO SA\u00b4NCHEZ-GARDUN\u02dcO, PHILIP K. MAINI & JUDITH PE\u00b4REZ-VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nwhere k0 is the maximum degree of gregariousness (at u = 0) and \u03c9 is the critical\ndensity at which movement switches from aggregative to repulsive. In this way, he\nobtained the aggregation-diffusion equation2 for low population density, i.e., in the\ncase where the probability, p, that one individual of the population is at point x at\ntime t, satisfies p << 1:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\n\u03c6\u2032(u)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n]\n, (12)\nwhere \u03c6(u) = (\u00b5\/2)u \u2212 k0u\n2 + (2k0)\/(3\u03c9)u\n3. Turchin used the above equation\nto describe the aggregative movement of Aphis varians, a herbivore of fireweeds\n(Epilobium angustifolium). He also discussed the ill-posedness of an initial and\nboundary value problem associated with 12. Depending on the actual profile of \u03c6,\nTurchin also classified in terms of weakly aggregative and strongly aggregative the\ndifferent types of aggregation.\nIn this paper we provide an alternative derivation (for low population density)\nof the equation by considering the dependence of k on p prior to arriving at the\ndiffusion approximation. The result is a slightly different equation to that derived\nby Turchin. In Section 2, we use a biased random walk approach to build a model to\ndescribe a direct aggregation phenomenon among individuals of one species living\nin a one-dimensional habitat. In Section 3 we study the existence of traveling wave\nsolutions (t.w.s.) for a purely negative or zero diffusion equation with a logistic\nrate of growth. Here we include some numerical simulations on the phase portrait\nof the traveling wave variables. In section 4 we solve numerically a couple of initial\nand boundary value problems associated with two nonlinear equations where the\ndensity-dependent diffusion term is less than or equal to zero and the reactive part\ndescribes logistic growth. In Section 5 we discuss the well- and ill-posedness of cer-\ntain boundary conditions associated with some purely negative diffusion equations\nwith logistic-like kinetic part. These problems come from the analysis of existence\nof t.w.s. for these equations. The paper ends with section 6 where we present some\nconclusions and discussion.\n2. Construction of the model and a comparison. Here we consider one species\nliving in a one-dimensional habitat. To derive the model we follow a biased random\nwalk approach plus a diffusion approximation. Thus we firstly discretize space in a\nregular manner. We let the distance between two successive points of the mesh be\n\u03bb, and we denote by p(x, t) the probability that any individual of the population is\nat the point x at time t. During a time period \u03c4 an individual which at time t is at\nposition x, can either:\n1. move to the right of x to the point x+ \u03bb, with probability R(x, t), or\n2. move to the left of x to the point x\u2212 \u03bb, with probability L(x, t) or\n3. stay at the position x, with probability N(x, t).\nBecause we allow no other possibilities of movement we have\nN(x, t) +R(x, t) + L(x, t) = 1. (13)\nAs a consequence of the above assumptions in [43], we have:\n2It should be noted that in [43], k(u) was introduced after the derivation of the diffusion\napproximation. However, including it before the approximation leads to a different form of equation\nto that derived in [43].\nDIRECT AGGREGATION AND TRAVELING WAVE DYNAMICS 461\nR(x, t) =\n1\n2\nr(x, t) + kp(x+ \u03bb, t)\nL(x, t) =\n1\n2\nr(x, t) + kp(x\u2212 \u03bb, t),\nwhere r is the random component of the movement.\nThe meaning of the product kp in the above expressions is as follows: Let us\nconsiderR(x, t): given that there is one conspecific to the right, kp(x+\u03bb, t) measures\nthe probability of occurrence of the event: the individual moves and does so to the\nright.\nIn the above terms, the probability p(x, t) can be written as follows:\np(x, t) = N(x, t\u2212\u03c4)p(x, t\u2212\u03c4)+R(x\u2212\u03bb, t\u2212\u03c4)p(x\u2212\u03bb, t\u2212\u03c4 )+L(x+\u03bb, t\u2212\u03c4 )p(x+\u03bb, t\u2212\u03c4).\n(14)\nNow, by using Taylor series, we obtain the well-known equation (see [28]) for p:\n\u03c4\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= \u2212\u03bb\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n{\u03b2(x, t)p(x, t)} +\n\u03bb2\n2\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n{\u00b5(x, t)p(x, t)} +O(\u03bb3), (15)\nwhere \u03b2(x, t) \u2261 R(x, t) \u2212 L(x, t) and \u00b5(x, t) \u2261 R(x, t) + L(x, t) are, respectively:\nthe bias and the motility. The above equation is sufficiently general to describe\ndifferent types of random-biased movements. In order to arrive at an equation\nwhich describes the more specific movements in which we are interested, we must\nwrite the probabilities R and L into \u03b2 and \u00b5, in such a way that they take into\naccount the assumptions stated above. In particular, the conditional probability, k,\nmust depend on p, i.e., k = k(p). In ecological terms, the function k must reflect\nthe behavioral aspects of the individuals of the species. In our derivation we assume\nthat k is a sufficiently smooth function of p. Thus, the probabilities R and L can\nbe re-written as follows:\nR(x, t) =\n1\n2\nr(x, t) + k(p(x+ \u03bb, t))p(x + \u03bb, t) (16)\nand\nL(x, t) =\n1\n2\nr(x, t) + k(p(x\u2212 \u03bb, t))p(x \u2212 \u03bb, t), (17)\nrespectively. Thus the bias and the motility are transformed as follows:\n\u03b2(x, t) = R(x, t)\u2212L(x, t) = k(p(x+\u03bb, t))p(x+\u03bb, t)\u2212 k(p(x\u2212\u03bb, t))p(x\u2212\u03bb, t) (18)\nand\n\u00b5(x, t) = R(x, t)+L(x, t) = r(x, t)+k(p(x+\u03bb, t))p(x+\u03bb, t)+k(p(x\u2212\u03bb, t))p(x\u2212\u03bb, t).\n(19)\nNow we expand k and p in Taylor series (around (x, t)) up to the linear terms in\nboth previous expressions. Thus, we have the following linear approximations:\n\u03b2(x, t) = 2\u03bb\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[k(p(x, t))p(x, t)] (20)\nand\n462 FAUSTINO SA\u00b4NCHEZ-GARDUN\u02dcO, PHILIP K. MAINI & JUDITH PE\u00b4REZ-VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\n\u00b5(x, t) = r(x, t) + 2k(p(x, t))p(x, t), (21)\nrespectively. Now, we substitute 20 and 21 into 15, use the diffusion approximation,\ni.e., we assume that \u03bb2\/(2\u03c4) \u2192 D > 0 (finite) as \u03c4, \u03bb \u2192 0, and writing down the\nresult in a more tractable and transparent form, we obtain the aggregation-diffusion-\nequation\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= D\n[\nr \u2212 2p2\ndk\ndp\n]\n\u22022p\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 2D\n[\n2p\ndk\ndp\n+ p2\nd2k\ndp2\n](\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n)2\n+D\n(\n2\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n\u2202r\n\u2202x\n+ p\n\u22022r\n\u2202x2\n)\n.\n(22)\nThis equation differs from that derived in [43] as we claimed before (see footnote\n2).\nNevertheless (for comparison with our calculations carried out in previous para-\ngraphs and with Turchin\u2019s) note that if we keep a constant random component, r,\nthen equation 22 reduces to\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= D\n[\nr \u2212 2p2\ndk\ndp\n]\n\u22022p\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 2D\n[\n2p\ndk\ndp\n+ p2\nd2k\ndp2\n](\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n)2\n, (23)\nwhich, by setting D(p) = D\n[\nr \u2212 2p2 dk\ndp\n]\n, can be written as the more familiar\ndensity-dependent diffusion equation (see [36] and [37])\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= D(p)\n\u22022p\n\u2202x2\n+D\u2032(p)\n[\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n]2\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\nD(p)\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n]\n. (24)\nThis equation contains, as a particular case, that used in [43] to describe the aggre-\ngation of Aphis varians. In fact, one can verify that taking k(p) = a ln p\u2212 bp+ c1,\nwhere a, b are such that Da = k0, Db = k0\/\u03c9, Dr = \u00b5\/2 and c1 is any positive\nnumber, one obtains 12. Note that choosing k in this way, the \u201cdensity-dependent\ndiffusion coefficient\u201d D(p) = D[r \u2212 2ap+ 2abp2] is negative for all p \u2208 (p1, p2) and\npositive otherwise, where p1 and p2 are the roots of D.\nTo draw a closer comparison with our equation, we now briefly review Turchin\u2019s\nderivation. One of the key differences between our derivation and that given by\nTurchin is that he does not substitute both linear approximations 20 and 21 of \u03b2\nand \u00b5, respectively, into 15 before carrying out the diffusion approximation. In fact,\nhe only substitutes 20 into 15 to obtain\n\u03c4\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= \u22122\u03bb2\n{[\nkp+ p2\ndk\ndp\n]\n\u22022p\n\u2202x2\n+\n[\nk + 3p\ndk\ndp\n+ p2\nd2k\ndp\n](\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n)2}\n+\n\u03bb2\n2\n{\u00b5(x, t)p(x, t)} +O(\u03bb3). (25)\nAfter some calculation this equation can be written as\n\u03c4\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= \u22122\u03bb2\n{[\n\u2212\n\u00b5\n4\n+ kp+ p2\ndk\ndp\n]\n\u22022p\n\u2202x2\n+\n[\nk + 3p\ndk\ndp\n+ p2\nd2k\ndp2\n](\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n)2}\n+\n\u03bb2\n2\n{\n2\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u00b5\n\u2202x\n+ p\n\u22022\u00b5\n\u2202x2\n}\n+O(\u03bb3). (26)\nDIRECT AGGREGATION AND TRAVELING WAVE DYNAMICS 463\nTo pass to the diffusion approximation, we assume that \u03bb\n2\n\u03c4\n\u2192 D > 0 (finite), as \u03bb\nand \u03c4 tend to zero. Equation 26 then becomes\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= 2D\n[\n\u00b5\n4\n\u2212 kp\u2212 p2\ndk\ndp\n]\n\u22022p\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 2D\n[\nk + 3p\ndk\ndp\n+ p2\nd2k\ndp2\n](\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n)2\n+\nD\n2\n{\n2\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n\u2202\u00b5\n\u2202x\n+ p\n\u22022\u00b5\n\u2202x2\n}\n. (27)\nConsider the particular case in which we have space independent motility, i.e.,\n\u00b5x \u2261 0.

(28)\nIf we write k(p) = b + mp with b > 0 and m < 0 (as in Turchin\u2019s paper) this\nequation becomes\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n=\n[\nD\u00b5\n2\n\u2212 2Dbp\u2212 4Dmp2\n]\n\u22022p\n\u2202x2\n+ [\u22122Db\u2212 8Dmp]\n(\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n)2\n, (29)\nor,\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\nD(p)\n\u2202p\n\u2202x\n]\n, (30)\nwhere D(p) = D\u00b52 \u2212 2Dbp\u2212 4Dmp\n2. Equation 30 coincides with Turchin\u2019s model\nby putting D = 1. Again, this equation has the general form 24.\nAlso note that equation 30 has an important feature for appropriate values of\nthe parameters: For positive values of b satisfying b2 > \u22122m\u00b5, equation 30 has\nnegative density-dependent diffusion coefficient for all p \u2208 (p1, p2) where p1 and p2\nare the roots of D(p), i.e., they are given by3\np1, p2 =\n1\n4m\n{\n\u2212b\u00b1\n\u221a\nb2 + 2m\u00b5\n}\n. (31)\nIn fact equation 30 degenerates at p = p1, p2.\nIn addition to the aggregation or spread factors one can consider a non-linear\ngrowth rate g to obtain the equation\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\nD(u)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n]\n+ g(u). (32)\nWhenever D(u) < 0 we call 32 a reaction-aggregation equation, while if D possesses\nboth (positive and negative) signs we will call it a reaction-aggregation (D < 0)-\ndiffusion (D > 0) equation.\nIn section 3 we will focus on equations whereD \u2264 0 within the domain of interest.\n3Given the ecological interpretation of p the negative root has no sense. We mention it for\ncompleteness.\n464 FAUSTINO SA\u00b4NCHEZ-GARDUN\u02dcO, PHILIP K. MAINI & JUDITH PE\u00b4REZ-VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\n3. On the existence of aggregative traveling waves. Among the possible spa-\ntial patterning models for aggregation, here we study the existence of traveling wave\nsolutions (t.w.s.) u(x, t) = \u03c6(x \u2212 ct) \u2261 \u03c6(\u03be) connecting the stationary and homo-\ngeneous states4 u(x, t) \u2261 1 and u(x, t) \u2261 0 for the degenerate reaction-aggregation\nequation\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\nD(u)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n]\n+ g(u), \u2200 (x, t) \u2208 IR\u00d7 IR+, (33)\nwhere D and g are defined on [0, 1] and satisfy the following conditions:\n1. g(0) = g(1) = 0, g(u) > 0 \u2200 u \u2208 (0, 1),\n2. g \u2208 C2[0,1], g\n\u2032(0) > 0, g\u2032(1) < 0,\n3. D(0) = 0, D(u) < 0 \u2200 u \u2208 (0, 1],\n4. D \u2208 C2[0,1], D\n\u2032(u) < 0 \u2200 u \u2208 (0, 1], and D\u2032\u2032(u) < 0 \u2200 u \u2208 [0, 1]. In addition\nwe distinguish the following two cases: a) D\u2032(0) = 0 with D\u2032(u) < 0 for all\nu \u2208 (0, 1] and b) D\u2032(u) < 0 for all u \u2208 [0, 1].\nWe also require the conditions: u(x, 0) = u0(x) with 0 \u2264 u0(x) \u2264 1 \u2200 x \u2208 IR,\n0 \u2264 u(x, t) \u2264 1 \u2200 (x, t) \u2208 IR\u00d7 IR+.\nNote that the condition 0 \u2264 u0(x) \u2264 1 \u2200 x \u2208 IR on the initial data comes from\nthe physical interpretation of the steady and homogeneous states 0 and 1. For\nexample, from an ecological point of view, we can interpret the state u(x, t) \u2261 1\nas a measure of the maximum population density sustainable in the medium while\nu(x, t) \u2261 0 is the state where there is no population. Hence we require the restriction\n0 \u2264 u(x, t) \u2264 1 \u2200 (x, t) \u2208 IR \u00d7 IR+ on the state variable u. As we will see, this\ncondition does not hold for any positive value of c.\nWe also note that, because of assumption 3., the non-linear diffusion equation 33\nis no longer of parabolic type. This can be seen by noting that the function\nF\n(\nu,\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n,\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n)\n\u2261 D(u)\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n+D\u2032(u)\n[\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n]2\n+ g(u),\nis not elliptic with respect to its third argument. Therefore the non-linear operator\nL[u] \u2261 F\n(\nu,\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n,\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n)\n\u2212\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n,\n4This imposes the following boundary conditions lim\u03be\u2192\u2212\u221e \u03c6(\u03be) = 1 and lim\u03be\u2192+\u221e \u03c6(\u03be) = 0.\nDIRECT AGGREGATION AND TRAVELING WAVE DYNAMICS 465\nis not parabolic5. Also equation 33 degenerates at u = 0. It is a simple degeneration\nwhenD(0) = 0 butD\u2032(0) 6= 0 and double doubly degenerate whenD(0) = D\u2032(0) = 0.\nBy using the above we can conclude that Turchin\u2019s equation 12 is not of parabolic\ntype on the interval (p1, p2) and has simple degeneracy at u = p1, p2. Here p1 and\np2 are the roots of \u03c6\n\u2032 in equation 12.\nWe can now begin the one-dimensional t.w.s. analysis for equation 33 by stating\nthat if this equation possesses a traveling wave connecting the homogeneous sta-\ntionary states u(x, t) \u2261 1 and u(x, t) \u2261 0, then c > 0. This can be shown in a\nsimilar way to that in [36].\nBy assuming that for c > 0, u(x, t) = \u03c6(x \u2212 ct) is a solution of 33 we substitute\nit into that equation to obtain the non-linear second order ODE\nD(\u03c6)\u03c6\u2032\u2032(\u03be) +D\u2032(\u03c6)[\u03c6\u2032(\u03be)]2 + c\u03c6\u2032(\u03be) + g(\u03c6) = 0, \u2200 \u03be \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e), (34)\nwhere the dash on D denotes derivative with respect to \u03c6 while the dash on \u03c6\ndenotes derivative with respect \u03be, with the boundary conditions \u03c6(\u2212\u221e) = 1 and\n\u03c6(+\u221e) = 0. In addition, we require 0 \u2264 \u03c6(\u03be) \u2264 1 for all \u03be. Now we follow\nthe classical approach in investigating the existence of t.w.s. of a PDE introduced\nby Kolmogorov et al. ([21]). This consists of re-stating the problem 33 in terms\nof finding the set of parameters for which there exist homoclinic or heteroclinic\ntrajectories of an ODE system. Thus, by setting \u03c6\u2032 = v the above equation can be\nwritten as the following singular (at \u03c6 = 0) ODE system\n\u03c6\u2032 = v\nD(\u03c6)v\u2032 = \u2212cv \u2212D\u2032(\u03c6)v2 \u2212 g(\u03c6).\n(35)\nHere we remove the singularity by using a standard reparametrization (see [6] and\n[36]) of the above system, which preserves the orientation of the corresponding\ntrajectories.

MAINI & JUDITH PE\u00b4REZ-VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nDepending on the local profile (at u = 0) of the diffusion coefficient D, the system\n37 has different dynamics. We consider two separate cases:\nCase 1. g satisfies 1-2 and D satisfies 3-4a). Here 37 has two \u201cfinite\u201d equilib-\nrium points: P0 = (0, 0) and P1 = (1, 0). Note that for D\n\u2032(0) = 0, (0,+\u221e) is also\nan equilibrium for 37.\nLocal Analysis:\nGiven that the eigenvalues of the Jacobian, J [f1, f2](0,0), of the system 37 at P0\nare \u03bb1 = 0 and \u03bb2 = \u2212c, then this equilibrium is a non-hyperbolic point. The\ncorresponding eigenvectors are\n~v1 = (1,\u2212g\n\u2032(0)\/c)T and ~v2 = (0, 1)\nT .\nThe implication of the non-hyperbolicity of P0 is that, because of the Hartman-\nGrobman theorem, the local dynamics (around P0) of 37 is not topologically equiv-\nalent to the dynamics of the linear system defined by J [f1, f2](0,0) (see [8]). In such\na case, the local phase portrait of 37 can be obtained by carrying out a non-linear\nlocal analysis, which is based on the center manifold theorem. This, in addition\nto other things, says that the local dynamics around a non-hyperbolic equilibrium,\nis determined by the dynamics around the center manifold of the system. The\nexistence of such a center manifold is also guaranteed. Here we are not including\nthe details as the basic ideas of the analysis can be seen elsewhere ([35]). For our\npurposes, it is sufficient to say that the non-linear local analysis shows that P0 is\na non-hyperbolic saddle-like point for all c > 0 where the unstable non-hyperbolic\nmanifold is the vertical axis and the one-dimensional center manifold (which is\nstable) is locally tangent to ~v1.\nThe linear analysis implies that P1 is a hyperbolic point with different features\ndepending on the speed c. In fact, we have:\n1. For c2 \u2265 4g\u2032(1)D(1), P1 is an unstable node. Here the eigenvalues of the\nJacobian matrix, J [f1, f2](1,0) are \u03bb1 =\n(\nc+\n\u221a\nc2 \u2212 4g\u2032(1)D(1)\n)\n\/2 and \u03bb2 =(\nc\u2212\n\u221a\nc2 \u2212 4g\u2032(1)D(1)\n)\n\/2. The corresponding eigenvectors are\n~v1 = (1,\u2212\u03bb1\/D(1))\nT and ~v2 = (1,\u2212\u03bb2\/D(1))\nT .\nNote that for c2 = 4g\u2032(1)D(1) the point P1 is a degenerate node. Con-\nsequently we have a damped (non-oscillatory) behavior around P1 implying\nthat the condition 0 \u2264 \u03c6(\u03be) \u2264 1 for all \u03be is violated.\n2. For c2 < 4g\u2032(1)D(1), P1 is an unstable focus. In this case, the local phase\nportrait of system 37 consists of oscillatory trajectories around P1. Again, the\nbounds on \u03c6 do not hold for these values of c.\nGlobal Analysis:\nFor this end we need the null-clines of the system 37. The horizontal (\u03c6\u02d9 = 0) null-\ncline consists of the vertical (\u03c6 \u2261 0) and the horizontal (v \u2261 0) axes. The vertical\n(v\u02d9 = 0) null-cline has two branches:\nV1(\u03c6) =\n\u2212c+\n\u221a\nc2 \u2212 4D\u2032(\u03c6)g(\u03c6)\n2D\u2032(\u03c6)\nand V2(\u03c6) =\n\u2212c\u2212\n\u221a\nc2 \u2212 4D\u2032(\u03c6)g(\u03c6)\n2D\u2032(\u03c6)\n. (38)\nDIRECT AGGREGATION AND TRAVELING WAVE DYNAMICS 467\nFor this case we have: lim\u03c6\u21920+ V1(\u03c6) = 0, V1(1) = 0, V1(\u03c6) < 0 \u2200 \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1).\nlim\u03c6\u21920+ V2(\u03c6) = +\u221e, V2(1) = \u2212c\/D\n\u2032(1), V2(\u03c6) > 0 \u2200 \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1).\nAdditionally, one can verify that in both cases (1 and 2), for positive values, c1\nand c2, of c with c1 < c2, the corresponding branches V\ncj\ni with i, j = 1, 2 are related\nas follows: V c11 (\u03c6) < V\nc2\n1 (\u03c6) and V\nc1\n2 (\u03c6) < V\nc2\n2 (\u03c6) for all \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1].\nFor Case 1 the qualitative behavior of V1 and V2 as c changes is as shown in\nFigure 1.\nNow let us consider the coordinate system generated by the basis {~v1, ~v2} at\nP1. This set of vectors generates the main directions on the phase portrait. For\nall positive values of c such that c2 > 4g\u2032(1)D(1), the trajectories of 37 leaving P1\nhave ~v2 as tangent vector. Actually, we are only interested in those trajectories of\n37 which, once they have left P1, enter the region R = {(\u03c6, v)|0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1, v \u2264 0}.\nMoreover, let us consider that trajectory of 37 whose path can be approximated\n(around P1) by the linear relationship v(\u03c6) = \u2212\n\u03bb2\nD(1) (\u03c6 \u2212 1). It can be seen that\nthis trajectory leaves P1 below the graph of V1. In a small neighborhood of P1, the\npath of v and the graph of V1, are close for sufficiently large values of c.\nGiven that for all positive values of c, P1 is unstable (node or focus), it follows\nthat the system 37 has no heteroclinic trajectory coming from P0 and ending at P1.\nFor the same reason there is no trajectory coming from (0,+\u221e) and ending at P1.\nBy considering all the above analysis, we are at the point of drawing an analogy\nbetween the t.w.s. analysis for the classical Fisher-KPP equation ut = uxx + g(u)\nand ours. For this goal, the key result is the following proposition.\nProposition 1. The system 37, with D and g as in Case 1, has a heteroclinic\ntrajectory connecting P1 with P0 (in this order) for c > 0 if and only if the system\n\u03c6\u02d9 = D(\u03c6)v\nv\u02d9 = \u2212cv \u2212D\u2032(\u03c6)v2 \u2212 g(\u03c6),\n(39)\nfor the same value of c, has a heteroclinic trajectory connecting P0 with P1 (in this\norder).\nProof. Suppose that for c > 0, (\u03c6c(\u03c4), vc(\u03c4)) is the trajectory of 37 connecting\nP1 with P0, i.e., satisfying the boundary conditions (\u03c6c(\u2212\u221e), vc(\u2212\u221e)) = (1, 0)\nand (\u03c6c(+\u221e), vc(+\u221e)) = (0, 0). We claim that the trajectory (\u03c6\u02dcc(\u03c4), v\u02dcc(\u03c4)) \u2261\n(\u03c6c(\u2212\u03c4), vc(\u2212\u03c4)) is the corresponding trajectory of the system 39 connecting P0\nwith P1. It is easy to verify that (\u03c6\u02dcc(\u03c4), v\u02dcc(\u03c4)) is a solution of the system 39.\nMoreover, given that time for this system is in the reverse sense compared with\nthat of 37, the boundary conditions for (\u03c6\u02dcc(\u03c4), v\u02dcc(\u03c4)) are as they are stated in the\nproposition. One can verify the reverse reasoning in a straightforward way. Hence\nthe proof follows.\nRecall that, in the classical Fisher-KPP t.w.s. analysis on the appropriate phase\nportrait, for each c \u2265 c0 = 2\n\u221a\ng\u2032(0) it is possible to choose a positive number\nm in such a way that the triangle T with boundaries: the segments 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1,\nv0 \u2264 v \u2264 0, and v(\u03c6) = \u2212m\u03c6 where v0 = v(1) = \u2212m, is a positive invariant set for\nthe ODE system \u03c6\u2032 = v, v\u2032 = \u2212cv \u2212 g(\u03c6). Therefore, by a direct consequence of\nthe Poincare\u00b4-Bendixson theorem, for each c \u2265 c0 the trajectory leaving P1 (which\nis a hyperbolic saddle point for all c > 0) through the left unstable manifold and\nentering the set T , ends at P0 (which, for c > 2\n\u221a\ng\u2032(0), is a stable node) as \u03be tends\nto +\u221e.\n468 FAUSTINO SA\u00b4NCHEZ-GARDUN\u02dcO, PHILIP K.

To construct the\nappropriate set, let us consider a C1[0,1] function f , such that: a) f < 0 \u2200 \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1),\nf(0) = v0 < 0, f(1) = 0, b) f\n\u2032 > 0 \u2200 \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1] with f \u2032(1) > \u2212\u03bb2\/D(1).\nThe following reasoning is close to that given by Hadeler (see [18]). For this we\ndefine the region Rf as follows: Rf = {(\u03c6, v)|0 < \u03c6 < 1, f(\u03c6) \u2264 v \u2264 0}. We have\nthe following proposition:\nProposition 2. For functions f with the properties listed above, there exist positive\nvalues of c such that the region Rf is a positive invariant set for the system 39.\nProof. We denote by ~Nint = (\u2212f\n\u2032(\u03c6), 1) the normal vector to the graph of f at\n(\u03c6, f(\u03c6)) pointing inwards towards Rf (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Proof of Proposition 2. For appropriate function f , the\nregion Rf is a positive invariant set for system 39. See text for\ndetails.\nWe now restrict the vector field defined by 39 on the graph of f .

MAINI & JUDITH PE\u00b4REZ-VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\n~Nint \u00b7 (\u03c6\u02d9, v\u02d9) is greater than or equal to zero on the graph of f for all \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1). A\nsimple calculation gives us\n~Nint \u00b7 (\u03c6\u02d9, v\u02d9) = \u2212(D(\u03c6)f(\u03c6)f\n\u2032(\u03c6) + cf(\u03c6) +D\u2032(\u03c6)(f(\u03c6))2 + g(\u03c6)).\nWe need ( ~Nint \u00b7 (\u03c6\u02d9, v\u02d9)) \u2265 0. This happens if, for \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1), we take c such that\nc \u2265 \u2212\nd\nd\u03c6\n[D(\u03c6)f(\u03c6)] \u2212\ng(\u03c6)\nf(\u03c6)\n.\nMoreover\nc \u2265 sup\n{\n\u2212\nd\nd\u03c6\n[D(\u03c6)f(\u03c6)] \u2212\ng(\u03c6)\nf(\u03c6)\n}\n,\nwhere the supremum is taken on \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1). In fact, if now we consider the set of\nfunctions f as above, the following condition on c characterizes the lowest value, c0,\nof c for which Rf is a positive invariant set for 39,\nc0 = inf sup\n{\n\u2212\nd\nd\u03c6\n[D(\u03c6)f(\u03c6)] \u2212\ng(\u03c6)\nf(\u03c6)\n}\n, (41)\nwhere the infimum is taken on the set of functions f . Then the proposition\nfollows.\nBy using Propositions 1 and 2, we conclude:\nProposition 3. For each c > 0 such that c \u2265 c0 where c0 satisfies 41 and for func-\ntions D and g as in Case 1, the system 37 has a heteroclinic trajectory connecting\nthe equilibrium P1 with P0.\nRemark 1. In order to remove the singularity at \u03c6 = 0 we have re-parametrized\nthe system 35. To make explicit the analogy with the Fisher-KPP t.w.s. analysis\nwe consider the system 39 whose trajectories run in opposite directions to those of\n37. Note that we could have carried out a simple reparametrization for doing both\nthings simultaneously.\nRemark 2. For a given f , a comparison between the values c0 and 2\n\u221a\ng\u2032(1)D(1)\ncan be useful to determine which type of connections the system 37 could have.\nOur numerical simulations (see Examples 1 and 2) strongly suggest that the set{\nc > 0|c2 > 4g\u2032(1)D(1)\n}\nis contained in the set {c|c \u2265 c0}. Also, these simulations\nshow that the set\n{\nc|0 < c < 2\n\u221a\ng\u2032(1)D(1)\n}\nis part of the above mentioned set.\nWe can summarize the above analysis by stating the following lemma:\nLemma 3.1. If the functions D and g satisfy the conditions mentioned in Case 1,\nthen for each positive value of c such that c > c0, where c0 satisfies 41, the equation\n33 has a t.w.s. which is:\n1. of monotone decreasing front type connecting the states u(x, t) \u2261 1\nand u(x, t) \u2261 0 if c satisfies the additional condition c2 > 4g\u2032(1)D(1). Here \u03c6\nsatisfies the condition 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1 for all values of its argument;\n2. of oscillatory (around the state u(x, t) \u2261 1) type connecting the states u(x, t) \u2261\n1 and u(x, t) \u2261 0, for c > 0 satisfying the additional condition c2 < 4g\u2032(1)D(1).\nHere the bounds, 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1, for \u03c6 are violated;\nDIRECT AGGREGATION AND TRAVELING WAVE DYNAMICS 471\n3. a damped (around u(x, t) \u2261 1) t.w.s. connecting u(x, t) \u2261 1 and u(x, t) \u2261 0 for\nc > 0 satisfying the extra condition c2 = 4g\u2032(1)D(1). Again, here the bounds\non \u03c6 are violated.\nTo illustrate the t.w.s. dynamics involved, we consider the following example:\nExample 1. The simplest equation satisfying the conditions in Case 1 is\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\n\u2212u2\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n]\n+ u(1\u2212 u). (42)\nThe corresponding system 37 is\n\u03c6\u02d9 = \u03c62v\nv\u02d9 = cv \u2212 2\u03c6v2 + \u03c6(1\u2212 \u03c6).\n(43)\nThe phase portrait of system 43 is shown in Figure 3. This shows the different\nheteroclinic trajectories of 43 as c varies.\nThus we have the different types of aggregation t.w.s. for equation 42, namely:\nmonotonic fronts (corresponding to the node-saddle-like heteroclinic trajectory),\ndamped fronts and damped oscillatory fronts (associated with the focus-saddle-like\nconnection), depending on the values of c. These are illustrated in Figure 3. Note\nthe damped behavior in the back of the t.w.s. in Figures 4(a) and 4(b).\nCase 2. g satisfies 1-2 and D satisfies 3-4b). (see these conditions at the\nbeginning of Section 3) Here, in addition to P0 and P1, the system 37 has a third\nequilibrium point: Pc = (0, vc) = (0,\u2212c\/D\n\u2032(0)) which, because of the condition\nD\u2032(0) 6= 0, comes from (0,+\u221e) (see Case 1). Note that Pc moves away monotoni-\ncally on the positive vertical axis as c increases.\nPart of the analysis carried out in Case 1 holds here. Thus, except where there\nare major differences, we do not go into great detail for this case.\nLocal Analysis:\nThe linear local analysis shows that for all positive values of c, Pc is a hyperbolic\nsaddle point where the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix J [f1, f2](0,vc) are \u03bb1 = c\nand \u03bb2 = \u2212c. The corresponding eigenvectors are ~v1 = (1, r\/2c)\nT and ~v2 = (0, 1)\nT ,\nwhere r =\n[\nD\u2032\u2032(0)c2\n(D\u2032(0))2 + g\n\u2032(0)\n]\n. Note that, depending on the values of c, the local\nunstable manifold of 37 at Pc has a different slope which varies as follows: it is zero\nfor c2 = \u2212g\n\u2032(0)(D\u2032(0))2\nD\u2032\u2032(0) , it is negative for c\n2 > \u2212g\n\u2032(0)(D\u2032(0))2\nD\u2032\u2032(0) and it is positive when\nthis last inequality is reversed.\nP0 is a non-hyperbolic point. The non-linear local analysis around P0 implies\nthat this equilibrium is a saddle-node point with the saddle-like sector to the right\nof P0 and the node-like region to the left. The behavior of the trajectories of 37\naround P1 is the same as in Case 1, i.e., they depend on the values of c as was\nstated in that case.\nGlobal Analysis:\nThe \u03c6 null-clines are the same as in Case 1. One can verify: V1(0) = 0, V1(1) = 0,\nV1(\u03c6) < 0 \u2200 \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1); meanwhile for V2, we have: V2(0) = \u2212c\/D\n\u2032(0), V2(1) =\n\u2212c\/D\u2032(1) and V2(\u03c6) > 0 \u2200 \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1).

Firstly, we note that for c = 0 and D and g as above, the equilibrium Pc\ncollapses into P0, and P1 becomes a center. Secondly, if we multiply the right hand\nsides of 37 by the strictly positive function \u2212D(\u03c6) with \u03c6 > 0, the resulting system\nhas the same dynamics as 37 on the first and fourth quadrants. Moreover, the\nconstructed system is Hamiltonian-like. One can verify that the Hamiltonian is\nH(\u03c6, v) =\n1\n2\n[D(\u03c6)v]2 +\n\u222b \u03c6\n\u03c60\nD(s)g(s)ds,\nwhere \u03c60 \u2208 (0, 1). The path of the trajectory of 37 passing through P0 coincides\nwith the contour curve H(\u03c6, v) = 0. By the properties of D and g apart from the\norigin, its positive branch touches the horizontal axis at \u03c6\u02dc0 > 1 with a vertical\ntangent vector. Since the contour curves of H are symmetrical with respect to\nthe horizontal axis, we have that the trajectory associated with this path is the\nhomoclinic connection of the proposition.\nRemark 3. Corresponding to the homoclinic trajectory of the system 37 we have\na standing wave of pulse type for equation 33. This wave violates the stated bounds\nfor \u03c6. Additionally, this trajectory is the boundary of a region on which the system\nhas a continuum of closed trajectories around P1.\nGiven that for c > 0 the equilibrium P1 is unstable (focus or node, depending on\nc), there is no trajectory of 37 connecting Pc with P1 for all c > 0.\nNow let us denote by \u03b8(\u03c6, v; c) the angle formed by the positive \u03c6-axis (\u03b8 grows\nin the counter-clockwise direction) and the vector field defined by 37 at the point\n(\u03c6, v) for the speed c. The following monotonicity property holds.\nProposition 5. For fixed (\u03c6, v) with \u03c6 > 0 and all v 6= 0, \u03b8(\u03c6, v; c) is a monotonic\nincreasing function of c.\nProof. We have that\ntan \u03b8(\u03c6, v; c) =\nf2(\u03c6, v)\nf1(\u03c6, v)\n,\nwhere f1 and f2 are the components of the vector field associated with system 37.\nFrom the above equation\nd\u03b8\ndc\n(\u03c6, v; c) =\n\u2212D(\u03c6)v2\n[D(\u03c6)v]2 + [cv +D\u2032(\u03c6)v2 + g(\u03c6)]2\n> 0,\nfor all (\u03c6, v) and c as in the proposition. Then the proof follows.\nNow, we focus on analyzing the behavior of the right unstable manifold, Wuc (Pc),\nof 37 as c increases. For this aim, we denote byWuc1(Pc1) andW\nu\nc2\n(Pc2) the right un-\nstable manifolds of 37 at Pc corresponding to the speed values c1 and c2, respectively\nwith c1 < c2. Then the following result holds:\nProposition 6. For any two positive values of c, c1 and c2 with c1 < c2:\n1. Wuc1(Pc1) runs below W\nu\nc2\n(Pc2) in the first quadrant as time increases,\n2. Wuc1(Pc1) runs above W\nu\nc2\n(Pc2) in the fourth quadrant, as time increases.\n476 FAUSTINO SA\u00b4NCHEZ-GARDUN\u02dcO, PHILIP K. MAINI & JUDITH PE\u00b4REZ-VELA\u00b4ZQUEZ\nProof. By contradiction. Let us start with item 1. Suppose that for c1 and c2 as\nin the statement, in a certain range Wuc1(Pc1) runs above W\nu\nc2\n(Pc2). This means\nthat there exists at least one point, (\u03c6\u2217, v\u2217), at which these manifolds intersect each\nother. Although the argument is valid if the intersection occurs at any other point,\nlet us assume that this happens below the graph of the v-null-cline V2. At the\nintersection point, the angles \u03b81 = \u03b81(\u03c6\n\u2217, v\u2217; c1) and \u03b82 = \u03b82(\u03c6\n\u2217, v\u2217; c2), are related\nby \u03b82 < \u03b81 which contradicts Proposition 5. Therefore our supposition is false. The\nsame argument can be used in proving item 2. Hence the proof follows.\nLet us take \u03c6\u02dc0 as in the proof of Proposition 4 and for c > 0 we denote by \u03c6\u02dcc\nthe point at which Wuc (Pc) crosses the horizontal axis. The following proposition\nholds:\nProposition 7. \u03c6\u02dc0 < \u03c6\u02dcc for all c > 0. Moreover, \u03c6\u02dcc increases monotonically on\nthe positive \u03c6 (horizontal) axis as c increases.\nProof. The monotonicity of \u03c6\u02dcc with respect to c is a consequence of the continuity\nof the vector field 37 with respect to \u03c6, v and c and Proposition 5. The existence\nof \u03c6\u02dcc for all c > 0 follows from the behavior of the vector field defined by 37. For\nexample, for small c, namely such that c2 > \u2212g\n\u2032(0)(D\u2032(0))2\nD\u2032\u2032(0) , the trajectory W\nu\nc (Pc)\nenters the second quadrant below the graph of V2, then the vector field 37 pushes up\nuntil it reaches the graph of V2, where its tangent vector must be horizontal pointing\ntowards the right. Then Wuc (Pc) is pushed down until it touches the horizontal axis\nat \u03c6\u02dcc. Except for some qualitative and quantitative changes on the graph of V2 (see\nFigure 3) which do not change the essential behavior of Wuc (Pc), similar arguments\ncan be used to conclude that, for bigger values of c, Wuc (Pc) touches the positive\n\u03c6-axis further away.\nOnce Wuc (Pc) reaches the horizontal axis, where does it go as time increases?\nThe following two propositions contain part of the answer.\nProposition 8. If for some c > 0, Wuc (Pc) connects the equilibrium Pc with P0\nit does so in such a way that, except at the origin, it never crosses the existing\nhomoclinic trajectory of 37 for c = 0.\nProof. Follows by using continuity arguments and Propositions 6 and 7.\nProposition 9. For positive values of c satisfying c2 \u2265 4g\u2032(1)D(1), Wuc (Pc) does\nnot connect Pc with P0. Moreover, W\nu\nc (Pc) behaves such that \u03c6 is finite but v is\nunbounded and negative, as time goes to +\u221e.\nProof. By Proposition 7 we have that for sufficiently large values of c, Wuc (Pc)\ncrosses the positive horizontal axis far away from \u03c6\u02dc0. On the other hand, for those\nvalues of c, the branch V1 of the v-null-cline is much closer to the horizontal axis\n(see Figure 5(b)). Thus the vector field 37 pushes Wuc (Pc) down leftwards with\ndecreasing vertical component. The norm of this component is bigger as v is more\nnegative.\nTo illustrate the t.w.s. dynamics studied in Case 2 we consider an example.\nDIRECT AGGREGATION AND TRAVELING WAVE DYNAMICS 477\nExample 2. Consider the equation\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\n\u2212(\u03b3u+ u2)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n]\n+ u(1\u2212 u), (44)\nwhere \u03b3 > 0. The corresponding system 37 is\n\u03c6\u02d9 = (\u03b3\u03c6+ \u03c62)v\nv\u02d9 = cv \u2212 (\u03b3 + 2\u03c6)v2 + \u03c6(1 \u2212 \u03c6).\n(45)\nThe phase portrait of the above system is shown in Figure 6 for different values\nof c. Note the homoclinic trajectory based at P0 for c = 0, and the focus (P1) to\nsaddle-node (P0), and the node (P1) to saddle-node (P0), heteroclinic trajectories.\nThe above homo- and heteroclinic connections of 45 correspond to a standing\nwave, an oscillatory front and monotonic front solutions, respectively, for equation\n44. See Figure 6.\n4. Numerical solutions. The degenerate diffusion term in equation 33 can lead to\nproblems for numerical simulation. To determine the origin of these problems, note\nthat the nonlinear density-dependent diffusion term \u2014once the x-derivative in cal-\nculated in 33\u2014 can be written as the sum of two terms: a strictly density-dependent\ndiffusive term and a convective term. When the convective term dominates the dif-\nfusive term, oscillations or wiggles will appear in the numerical solution if classical\nfinite element, finite difference or finite box methods are used. This is caused by\nthe negative diffusion arising from the numerical discretization method.\nThere are several numerical techniques that can be used to treat these numerical\ndifficulties. Some of these are developed in [14] and [15]. A sufficiently fine spatial\ngrid may be useful but this strategy can prove to be computationally expensive.\nAnother method is to stabilize the discretization by adding numerical diffusion,\ni. e. the addition of a diffusion term \u01eb\u2202\n2u\n\u2202x2\n, where \u01eb << 1, a common practice\nto eliminate or reduce non-physical oscillations near discontinuities [1, 20]. This\nmethod avoids the spread of errors in the calculation or accumulation of errors\nleading to \u201cblow up\u201d. In particular the addition of the diffusion term leads to the\nrecovery of the stability conditions of the numerical scheme.\nThe difficulty with problems of this kind is the treatment of the numerical flux\nand in setting up the problem to enable such treatment. We have chosen to use\nan approach (by introducing a change of variable) that allows us to deal with the\ndegeneracy in equation 33 and then solve it by using a conventional method for\nconvection-diffusion equations.\nIn this section we present the numerical solutions of Examples 1 and 2. We used\nthe routine D03PSF from the NAG Fortran Library for convection-diffusion one\nspace dimension problems. D03PSF integrates the system of convection-diffusion\nequations in conservative form:\nN\u2211\nj=1\nPi,j\n\u2202Uj\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202Fi\n\u2202x\n= Ci\n\u2202Di\n\u2202x\n+ Si (46)\nfor i = 1, 2, ..., N (with N =number of equations), a \u2264 x \u2264 b, t \u2265 t0, where Uj are\nthe state variables.

In\nExample 1, equation 42, by putting v = u3 (then \u2202v\n\u2202x\n= 3u2 \u2202u\n\u2202x\n) can be rewritten as\nthe algebraic-partial differential system\n0 = v \u2212 u3\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2212\n1\n3\n\u22022v\n\u2202x2\n+ u(1\u2212 u).\nWe will then have that D in 46 is u3, C = \u2212 13 and F = 0.\nIn a similar way to the previous example, for Example 2, equation 44 can be\nrewritten by using v = \u2212 13u\n3 \u2212 12\u03b3u\n2, so \u2202v\n\u2202x\n= \u2212u2 \u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u03b3u\u2202u\n\u2202x\n= \u2212(u2 + \u03b3u)\u2202u\n\u2202x\n.\nThus, the above equation results in the algebraic-partial differential system\n0 = v +\n1\n3\nu3 +\n1\n2\n\u03b3u2\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u22022v\n\u2202x2\n+ u(1\u2212 u).\n480 FAUSTINO SA\u00b4NCHEZ-GARDUN\u02dcO, PHILIP K.

Profiles are shown at\nregular time intervals. Traveling wave profiles can be seen in both examples. The\nspecific initial and boundary values are given in the corresponding figure captions.\nApart from being able to display the traveling wave behavior of the solutions, the\nnumerical results also contain data that can be used to compute the wavespeed. The\nwavespeed of the t.w.s. of interest is bounded by the minimum wavespeed cmin (this\nensures we have positive solutions). Equations with known traveling wave solutions\nraise the question of stability. Studies on the stability of these types of solutions\nhave already established a relationship between the stability of the wave and its\nspeed. For example, for the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation it was shown [33, 34] that\nslow waves are unstable while faster waves are stable. These are the ones that can\nusually be obtained numerically.\nTime-asymptotic behavior of the traveling wave solutions of nonlinear equations\nof Fisher type has also been previously considered [17, 22], making clear why typ-\nical numerical simulations of the Fisher-KPP equation result in a stable wavefront\nsolution with speed 2 (minimum speed).\nFor qualitative comparison, we draw the solution of the system 43 corresponding\nto the speed c = 2.8. In Figure 11 the reader can see the pair of functions \u03c6c(\u03c4), vc(\u03c4)\nwhich defines the heteroclinic trajectory connecting P1 and P0.

We now use this approximation\nto produce the corresponding ODE profiles (see Figures 11 and 12). ODE profiles\nwere generated with MATLAB, using the software (pplane7) developed by John C.\nPolking, Department of Mathematics, Rice University. The aim of presenting the\nsolution of the associated ODE systems (43 and 45) corresponding to the wavespeed\napproximation is to compare it to the t.w.s. found numerically and point out the\nqualitative agreement.\n5. A note on the general approach. In section 3 we have used a phase portrait\nanalysis to prove the existence of different types of heteroclinic trajectories for two\nfamilies of autonomous ODE systems. Those give us the t.w.s. for equation 33 in\ntwo main cases. Some of the t.w.s., for appropriate values of c, violate the bounds\n0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 1 on \u03c6 which means that for those values of c the original problem (as\nstated at the beginning of Section 3) does not have a solution. For this reason, the\nanalysis of existence of t.w.s. in the full PDE equation satisfying some prescribed\ninitial and boundary conditions and its re-statement in terms of looking for the\nvalues of c for which there exist heteroclinic or homoclinic trajectories of an ODE\nsystem in the t.w.s. variables, must be studied more carefully.

We say that P1(P2) implies P2(P1) whenever the existence of\na solution of P1(P2) implies the existence of a solution of P2(P1). When the\nimplication is in both senses we will say that problems P1 and P2 are equivalent.\nLet us denote by CE the set of values of c for which P1 (5) has a t.w.s. u(x, t) =\n\u03c6(x\u2212 ct). The following proposition holds:\nProposition 10. If CE is a non-empty set, then for each c \u2208 CE, P1 (5) implies\nP2 (5).\nProof. For c as in the statement, let u(x, t) = \u03c6(x \u2212 ct) be a solution of P1 (5).\nThen \u03c6 satisfies\nD(\u03c6)\u03c6\u2032\u2032(\u03be) +D\u2032(\u03c6)[\u03c6\u2032(\u03be)]2 + c\u03c6\u2032(\u03be) + g(\u03c6) = 0,\n484 FAUSTINO SA\u00b4NCHEZ-GARDUN\u02dcO, PHILIP K.

If we set \u03c6\u2032 = v, then (\u03c6(\u03be), v(\u03be)) is a\nsolution of the singular boundary value problem\n\u03c6\u2032 = v\nD(\u03c6)v\u2032 = \u2212cv \u2212D\u2032(\u03c6)v2 \u2212 g(\u03c6),\n\u03c6(\u2212\u221e) = 1, \u03c6(+\u221e) = 0 and v(\u2212\u221e) = 0, v(+\u221e) = 0 with 0 \u2264 \u03c6(\u03be) \u2264 1.\nTherefore, writing\n\u03c6(\u03c4) \u2261 \u03c6(\u03be(\u03c4)) and v(\u03c4) \u2261 v(\u03be(\u03c4)),\nwhere \u03c4 satisfies 39, and substituting into the above system we conclude that the\npair (\u03c6(\u03c4), v(\u03c4)) is a solution of the non-singular boundary value problem P2 (5).\nHence the result follows.\nNow we consider the converse: Let CS be the set of values of c for which problem P2\n(5) has a solution. Our results, and the illustrative examples in the previous section,\nshow us that the above is a non-empty set. Because of the condition 0 \u2264 \u03c6(\u03c4) \u2264 1 we\nnote that if problem P2 (5) has solution for each c \u2208 CS , such a set must be included\nin (or is equal to) the set\n{\nc|c2 > 4g\u2032(1)D(1)\n}\n\u2229 {c|c \u2265 c0}, where c0 satisfies 41.\nWe can prove the following proposition:\nProposition 11. For each c belonging to the set CS, P2 (5) implies P1 (5).\nProof. Let (\u03c6(\u03c4), v(\u03c4)) be the solution of P2 (5) corresponding to c \u2208 CS . Since\nd\u03be\nd\u03c4\n= \u2212D(\u03c6) > 0 for \u03c6 6= 0,\nthe function \u03be = \u03be(\u03c4) has an inverse \u03c4 = \u03c4(\u03be). Define\n\u03c6(\u03be) \u2261 \u03c6(\u03c4(\u03be)) and v(\u03be) \u2261 v(\u03c4(\u03be)).\nBy using 39 we have\n\u03c6\u2032(\u03be) = \u2212\n\u03c6\u02d9\nD(\u03c6(\u03be))\nand v\u2032(\u03be) = \u2212\nv\u02d9\nD(\u03c6(\u03be))\n.\nSubstituting \u03c6\u02d9 and v\u02d9 into 40 we obtain the ODE system appearing in the proof of\nProposition 10. This was derived from the second order ODE in P1 (5). Conditions\n1. and 2. in P1 (5) are also satisfied because of the conditions at the boundary in\nP2 (5).\nRemark 4. Clearly for c such that c2 \u2264 4g\u2032(1)D(1) P2 (5) has no solution because\nthe damped behavior (with oscillations when the strict inequality holds or without\nthem in case of equality) around P1 violates the bound (0 \u2264 \u03c6(\u03be) \u2264 1) of \u03c6.\nIn light of Remark 4, it is necessary to analyze the eventual equivalence between\nP1 (5) and P2 (5) in a more general context. In particular, we consider the case of\nill-posedness. Here we adopt the definition given in [2]:\nDefinition 5.2. A boundary or initial value problem for a partial differential equa-\ntion is said to be ill-posed (or improperly posed) in the sense of Hadamard, if at\nleast one of the following conditions fails:\n1. The existence of the solution,\n2. The uniqueness of the solution,\nDIRECT AGGREGATION AND TRAVELING WAVE DYNAMICS 485\n3. The continuity of the solution with respect to the prescribed initial data.\nThe problem is a well-posed one when the above conditions hold.\nThe above definition is made precise by indicating the space in which the solution\nmust belong and the measure in which the continuous dependence is desired.\nIn terms of the above definition we can re-state part of our results as follows:\nProposition 12. For functions D and g as in Case 1 or Case 2, and for each c > 0\nsuch that c2 \u2264 4g\u2032(1)D(1) the problem P2 (5), hence P1 (5)) is an ill-posed one.\nMeanwhile for each c > 0 belonging to the set\n{\nc|c2 > 4g\u2032(1)D(1)\n}\n\u2229{c|c \u2265 c0} that\nproblem (hence P1 (5)) is well-posed.\n6. Conclusions and discussion. By way of conclusion and discussion we address\nthe following items:\n1. The analysis of the existence of t.w.s. u(x, t) = \u03c6(x \u2212 ct) for equations of\nthe form 33 with D(u) \u2264 0 \u2200 u \u2208 [0, 1] and g(0) = g(1) = 0 with g(u) >\n0 \u2200 u \u2208 (0, 1) satisfying some suitable initial and boundary conditions is less\nunderstood than that for the case D(u) \u2265 0 (see [6, 26] and [27]). In fact,\nsome of these problems are ill-posed (see Section 5) and not well studied.\n2. The description of direct aggregation phenomena by using negative diffusion\nequations perhaps deals with relatively simple models but encounters problems\nwith ill-posedness.\n3. The derivation of the aggregation equation 23 took into account the mu-\ntual attraction between conspecifics. This has a clear interpretation. This\nis an important difference between our model and other approaches, namely,\nintegro-differential equations or the Ginzburg-Landau equation, whose inter-\npretation is not derived from first principles at the level of individual behavior\nwithin the population. Our derivation is motivated by the work of Turchin\nand builds on it.\n4. We have only treated the t.w.s dynamics of strictly negative diffusion equa-\ntions for which, as far as we know, there is no stability theory available. The\nanalysis of the existence of t.w.s. for the case when the density dependent dif-\nfusion coefficient changes sign would, we feel, also raise challenging problems.\nAcknowledgments.
