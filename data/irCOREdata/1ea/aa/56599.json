Introduction\n[2] The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is the domi-\nnant dynamical phenomenon in the equatorial stratosphere,\nand is characterised by a descending pattern of winds\nwhich, at any fixed altitude, exhibits repeated switching\nbetween easterly and westerly with \u000228 month cycling\nperiod. The interaction of the QBO with gravity waves\nand planetary waves generates QBO-like effects in the\nequatorial mesosphere (MQBO) [e.g., Burrage et al.,\n1996], in the extra-tropical stratosphere [e.g., Dunkerton\nand Baldwin, 1991; Baldwin and Dunkerton, 1998] and in\nthe mid and high-latitude mesosphere and lower thermo-\nsphere (MLT) [e.g., Jacobi et al., 1996; Hibbins et al.,\n2007]; although Baumgaertner et al. [2005] did not find a\nsignificant correlation between Scott Base (78\u0002S, 167\u0002E)\nMLT mean winds and the QBO. Both the QBO and its\ndynamical and chemical global interactions are reviewed\nthoroughly by Baldwin et al. [2001].\n[3] Through analysis of horizontal winds at 95 km\naltitude derived from the SuperDARN radar at Halley\n(76\u0002S, 27\u0002W), Antarctica, Hibbins et al. [2007] showed a\nmodulation of the semidiurnal tide related to the QBO. They\nsuggested that this modulation was due to the propagation of\nplanetary waves from the troposphere in the winter hemi-\nsphere to the mesosphere in the summer hemisphere, being\neither blocked or allowed under easterly or westerly equato-\nrial MQBO conditions respectively. Hibbins et al. [2009],\nagain using SuperDARN wind measurements, but this time\nfrom both the Arctic and Antarctic, to further examine this\nhypothesis studied the planetary wave activity itself. This\nsupported the process of significant inter-hemispheric prop-\nagation of planetary waves from the winter to the summer\nhemisphere with gating in the equatorial region dependent\nupon the phase of the MQBO.\n[4] Lower down, stratospheric planetary wave activity is\nalso affected by the phase of the QBO in the equatorial\nstratosphere through QBO-dependent changes in the zero-\nwind line which guides vertical planetary wave propagation.\nObservational studies suggested a colder, stronger polar\nwinter vortex during westerly QBO and a more disturbed,\nwarmer, polar vortex during easterly QBO. Holton and Tan\n[1980] explained this as due to movement of the zero-wind\nline further away from the equator to the subtropics of the\nwinter hemisphere under easterly compared to westerly\nQBO. This latitudinally narrows the region through which\nvertically-propagating stationary planetary waves from the\nextratropical troposphere can travel, because they can only\npropagate through a waveguide of westerly wind, and hence\nthey tend to be refracted poleward. As a consequence, large\namplitude wave events break and dissipate nearer the pole\nso that the polar vortex is slowed and the polar stratosphere\nbecomes warmer. Conversely, if the QBO is westerly,\nplanetary waves are less latitudinally restricted and their\ncentre of activity moves further away from the pole, leading\nto a colder and more stable vortex. This \u2018Holton-Tan\nrelationship\u2019 has been shown by several authors not to be\nstatistically robust particularly under solar maximum con-\nditions [Labitzke, 1987; Gray et al., 2001], and during late\nwinter [Naito and Hirota, 1997]. However, Lu et al. [2008]\nhave shown that its reported failure in late winter is likely to\nbe an artefact due to analysis of data at a single pressure\nlevel simultaneous with a downward movement of the\nextra-tropical QBO signal between early and late winter.\n[5] Baldwin and Dunkerton [1998] reported on observa-\ntions of the modulating effect of the QBO on the wintertime\nAntarctic stratospheric polar vortex. They noted that the\nvortex is much stronger and longer-lived than its equivalent\nin the Arctic as planetary waves do not significantly disrupt\nthe Antarctic polar vortex in the lower and middle strato-\nsphere; consequently the QBO was not observed to modu-\nlate the vortex strength during midwinter. The QBO was\nobserved to modulate the winds at mid-latitudes from late\nautumn, but, unlike in the northern hemisphere, this mod-\nulation remained restricted to the mid-latitudes through\nwinter and early spring. Nevertheless, they observed the\ntemperature of the southern hemisphere wintertime polar\nvortex to be slightly colder under westerly than easterly\nQBO. They found that the southern hemisphere effects were\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L20801, doi:10.1029\/2009GL039848, 2009\n1British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\nPublished in 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\nL20801 1 of 6\nbest observed using a QBO pressure level of 25 hPa to\ndefine its phase.\n[6] In this paper we measure the QBO influence on the\nwinds in the Antarctic mesosphere and lower thermosphere\nand relate this both to planetary wave dynamics and to\npublished QBO effects on the stratospheric polar vortex.\nQuantifying the QBO influence is a necessary prerequisite\nfor investigating and quantifying other possible longer-term\ninfluences on the mesosphere including the effects of solar\nvariability, ozone loss and recovery, and anthropogenic\ngreenhouse gases.\n2. Analysis\n[7] The analysis presented here utilises data from the\nimaging Doppler interferometer (IDI) technique [Adams et\nal., 1985] at Halley where it has been used to measure\nmesospheric winds nearly continuously between December\n1996 and December 2007. The data cover five QBO cycles\nand a full solar cycle. Its operation at Halley is an adaptation\nof the NOAA HF radar [Grubb, 1979] and has been\ndescribed in detail by Jones et al. [1997], Charles and\nJones [1999] and Hibbins et al. [2006]. Variations in the\nrefractive index due to ionization irregularities produce\nindependent scattering regions, from each of which a line\nof sight Doppler velocity is measured. By inclusion of many\nsimultaneously occurring scattering regions in a 3D analy-\nsis, three components of the wind are derived, within an\naltitude range of 50\u2013105 km. However, the lower portion of\nthe IDI range, below 70 km, is noisy and produces a less\ncontinuous data series, and so has been excluded from this\nanalysis, as has much of the data from 2002 due to antenna\ndamage. Data are recorded either every 5 or every 15minutes,\nand derived wind data are binned into 5 km altitude ranges.\nThis IDI technique has been validated [Jones et al., 2003]\nat Bear Lake, Utah, through a direct comparison with a\nco-located meteor radar.\n[8] For this study, hourly mean winds were firstly derived\nfor each 5 km high altitude bin, from 70\u2013105 km. Follow-\ning the method of Charles and Jones [1999], to maximise\ndata integrity, wind velocity values for each component\nscattering region where adequate signals were not received\nin all eight antenna-pulse combinations were first removed.\nValues in excess of \u00b1120 m\/s were also removed, as these\nare unlikely to represent valid winds. Tides with periods of\n12 and 24 hours were removed from a four day running\nmean of the data. Monthly averages were then formed for\nthe 12 years of data. These were deseasonalised by sub-\ntracting the climatological monthly means from each indi-\nvidual month of data.\n3. Climatologies\n[9] Figure 1 shows the monthly climatological means, as\nderived above. The strongest zonal winds, up to 10 m\/s, are\nin the eastwards (positive, red) jet which occurs above\n90km from November to March in summer. Below this,\nfrom 75\u201390 km over the same period, is a weaker west-\nwards jet with winds under 4 m\/s. During the wintertime\nfrom March to September an extensive eastwards jet occurs\nbelow 95 km extending upwards from the stratospheric\nvortex region; this persists until October above 80 km.\nAbove 95 km, in the winter months, there are generally\nmuch weaker eastwards winds, briefly reversing to weak\nwestwards winds in midwinter. This climatology is in good\ngeneral agreement with those generated by Hibbins et al.\n[2006] based on a subset of the data used in this study. It\nestablishes the baseline against which the altitude profile of\nthe effect of the QBO can be investigated (below).\n4. QBO Dependence\n4.1. Analysis\n[10] To examine the relation between polar mesosphere\ndynamics and the equatorial stratospheric wind, these two\ndata sets have been cross-correlated. The IDI data used are\nas described above, and the QBO data are monthly zonally\naveraged equatorial winds from 50 hPa, accessed from\nNOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Centre; QBO data from\n50 hPa were used as this is the reference level widely used\nby other authors.\n[11] We calculate the correlation between Halley data and\nthe equatorial 50 hPa QBO for lags between 0 and\n\u000328 months stepping one month at a time, (thus covering\nthe complete QBO cycle, which averages \u000228 months [e.g.,\nNaujokat, 1986]). A negative lag as used here means that\nthe IDI data is lagging behind the QBO winds. The 95%\nFigure 1. IDI zonal mean wind climatology, eastwards positive with contours at 0.5 m\/s intervals. The thick black contour\nrepresents the zero wind line.\nL20801 FORD ET AL.: ANTARCTIC MESOSPHERIC WINDS AND THE QBO L20801\n2 of 6\nconfidence level has been calculated from a Student\u2019s T-test\nfor a two-tailed distribution using an effective sample size\n(N0) to account for the adverse effect on the significance\nlevel of any autocorrelation in either of the time series [e.g.,\nBrown, 2008].\n[12] Figure 2 shows cross correlations between the ob-\nserved zonal mean wind anomalies and the QBO at 50 hPa,\nfor lags from 0 to \u000328 months, which are equivalent to\napproximate QBO pressure levels of 50 to 1.3 hPa respec-\ntively. The near-linear relationship between the phase of the\nQBO and log pressure level was calculated by Baldwin and\nDunkerton [1998], who showed that a phase difference, or\nlag, is equivalent to defining the QBO from a different\npressure level. They used NCEP global data from 1000 to\n1 hPa at the equator to determine the phase where the\ncorrelation with the QBO at various pressure levels max-\nimises. They found the difference in phase between maxi-\nmum correlations between 50 hPa (as used here) and 10 hPa\nto be 151\u0002 at the equator. Taking an average QBO cycle\nperiod of 28 months, this corresponds to an 11.8 month lag.\nAssuming a linear relationship between log pressure and\nQBO phase, pressure levels derived in this way are shown\non the top axes of Figure 2 for comparison with the lag in\nmonths on the bottom axes.\n[13] In Figure 2a the whole dataset is considered. No\nstatistically significant correlation above the 95% confi-\ndence level is seen for any IDI data altitude or QBO lag,\nexcept for at long lags at 95 km. However, when seasonal\nsubsets of the data are considered, areas of statistically\nsignificant correlation become evident as indicated in\nFigure 2 by black crosses. This is particularly the case for\nwinter (Figure 2b) and spring (Figure 2c) discussed below.\nFigure 2. Cross correlations between QBO and mean zonal wind anomalies at each altitude bin for (a) all data, (b) winter\nmonths only (June, July, and August) and (c) spring months only (September, October, and November). Crosses show areas\nabove the 95% confidence level. Grey contour lines are every 0.2 units.\nL20801 FORD ET AL.: ANTARCTIC MESOSPHERIC WINDS AND THE QBO L20801\n3 of 6\n4.2. Winter\n[14] In winter (Figure 2b), strong correlations are ob-\nserved between 85 and 105 km altitude, with many regions\nof the plot above the 95% confidence level. There is a\nregion of anti-correlation above \u000285 km for lags from 0 to\n\u00038 months, which peaks between 95 and 100 km altitude,\nwhere it exceeds the 95% confidence level. This range of\nlags corresponds to a QBO pressure level of 50 hPa up to\napproximately 15 hPa. Above this, for pressure levels\ncorresponding to the QBO from 15 to 3 hPa (\u00039 to\n\u000321 months lag) the correlation is positive, again max-\nimising at 95\u2013100 km, with correlation coefficients of\nabout 0.5. Further above this pressure level the correlation\nturns negative again, reaching the 95% confidence level\nabove \u00022 hPa from 90\u2013105 km. This corresponds to lags of\nbetween \u000324 and \u000328 months and the correlation reaches\n\u00030.54 in this region. It should be noted that stronger\ncorrelations and higher levels of confidence are likely to\npreferentially exist at the higher IDI sampling altitudes\nbecause this is where the IDI technique inherently achieves\nconsiderably better data coverage [Hibbins et al., 2006].\n[15] The centre of the region of positive correlation\noccurs at a lag of approximately \u000316 months which is\nequivalent to correlating the IDI winds with the equatorial\nQBO at a pressure level of about 7 hPa. This is in good\nagreement with the pressure level of 10 hPa found by Espy\net al. [1997] and 5 hPa by Hibbins et al. [2007] to be\noptimum for QBO-related modulations in the summertime\npolar mesosphere. This lag of \u000316 months has therefore\nbeen used here to determine the magnitude of the winter-\ntime QBO related effect in the winds.\n[16] Figure 3a shows the difference climatology between\nwesterly and easterly QBO conditions with a lag of\n\u000316 months; a three month data window is used. The gray\nregions indicate month-altitude combinations where there\nwas insufficient data to derive a value due to the low\nnumber of data points from the maximum 12 years of data.\nThe dashed lines indicate regions where the difference is\ngreater than the 90% confidence level, as determined from a\nMonte Carlo approach taking the distribution generated by\nrandomly binning the data 1000 times. The solid line\nregions are the same for the 95% confidence level.\n[17] As would be expected from the region of statistically\nsignificant strong positive correlations at \u000316 months lag\nfrom Figure 2b, Figure 3a shows a positive difference\nbetween westerly and easterly QBO in winter, above\n85 km. This difference peaks at 2.6 m\/s in July. When the\nQBO at 5hPa (equivalent to \u000316 months lag) is westerly,\nplanetary waves formed in the winter hemisphere can\npropagate through the equatorial MQBO gate [Hibbins et\nal., 2007] to the summer hemisphere. This will result in less\nplanetary wave activity in the winter polar mesosphere, and\nconsequently a stronger vortex in the mesosphere. This is\nseen in the stronger westerly mesospheric wind anomalies at\nHalley as shown in Figure 3a.\n[18] However, when the MQBO is in the westerly phase,\nthe stratospheric QBO is easterly [Baldwin et al., 2001].\nUnder easterly QBO conditions in the equatorial strato-\nsphere, planetary waves formed in the winter hemisphere\nare deflected away from the equator, and so remain trapped\nin the winter hemisphere stratosphere. This will result in a\nweaker polar vortex as it is disrupted by planetary wave\nFigure 3. Zonal wind difference climatologies (QBO westerly minus easterly data) for (a) using a \u000316 month lag;\n(b) using a \u00036 month lag in the QBO data. Contour lines are shown every 2 m\/s, and blanked out areas have no data\navailable for one or both phases of the QBO. The dashed and solid contours represent levels of 90 and 95% confidence\nrespectively.\nL20801 FORD ET AL.: ANTARCTIC MESOSPHERIC WINDS AND THE QBO L20801\n4 of 6\nactivity; this is the Holton-Tan effect. Thus, in winter, the\ncorrelation between MQBO and winds will tend to be\nopposite in the stratosphere to that in the MLT. Figure 2b\nsuggests the presence of this effect, and with a reversal in\ncorrelation below \u000280 km. Comparison with Figure 1\nshows the QBO dependence of the wind in the upper\nmesosphere (up to 2.6 m\/s) is large compared with the\nbackground climatological mean.\n4.3. Spring\n[19] Figure 2c shows correlations for the austral spring.\nThere is an area of strong positive correlation (up to 0.54)\nfor lags between\u00032 and\u00038months and for altitudes between\n70 km and 90 km which is consistently above the 95%\nconfidence level. There is only weak evidence for areas of\nstatistically significant correlation at other altitudes and lags.\n[20] These data indicate that, in spring, there is an\neastward enhancement of the winds under westerly QBO,\nwhere the QBO phase is determined at \u000225 hPa (equivalent\nto a lag of \u00036 months). This agrees closely with the\nobservations by Baldwin and Dunkerton [1998] who used\nNCEP assimilative data in the southern hemisphere strato-\nsphere. They found that in the upper stratosphere (at 5 hPa)\nthere was a strong difference climatology (QBO westerly-\neasterly) centred on \u000270\u0002S in November; this difference\nreached 10 m\/s (i.e. the wind was more eastward during\nwesterly QBO). They found that 25 hPa was the best\nreference pressure level when calculating QBO phase; this\nmatches the lag for the region of highest correlation with the\nIDI data in Figure 2b.\n[21] Baldwin and Dunkerton [1998] noted that November\ncoincided with the final break up of the polar vortex and\nargued that the vortex was then weak enough to show a\nresponse to the QBO dependence of the planetary waves.\nFigure 3b shows the difference climatology, in the same\nmanner as for Figure 3a, but for a lag of \u00036 months, which\ncorresponds to a QBO pressure level of 25 hPa. This\ndifference peaks at 7.6 m\/s in November, at 70 km, and\nextends through the mesosphere with confidence levels\ngreater than 95% from 80\u201390 km. The peak above 80 km\nis nearer October, and as the vortex in the mesosphere is\ninherently weaker than in the stratosphere, may therefore be\nsusceptible to planetary wave action at an earlier date.\n[22] It should also be noted that Hibbins et al. [2009]\nhave demonstrated that planetary waves can reach the\nAntarctic mesosphere in summer from the opposite (winter)\nhemisphere depending upon the phase of the MQBO. If the\nequatorial QBO at 25 hPa is westerly, then the MQBO will\nbe easterly [Baldwin et al., 2001]. This will mean that\nplanetary waves are blocked from propagating across the\nequator and thus the vortex in the mesosphere will remain\nmore stable with a stronger westerly wind (Figure 3b).\nTherefore, in spring, the westerly equatorial QBO in the\nstratosphere and the simultaneous easterly MQBO will act\nin the same sense regarding the stability of the vortex. This\nis the converse of the situation in winter, as discussed\nabove, when they will act in the opposite sense.\n5. Summary\n[23] Data from the Imaging Doppler Interferometer at\nHalley over a 12 year period are used to investigate the link\nbetween Antarctic mesospheric winds and the equatorial\nstratosphere through the QBO.\n[24] During the winter months, westerly winds extend\nupwards from the polar vortex into the mesosphere to 90 km\nand show a clear correlation, above the 95% confidence\nlevel, with the equatorial QBO from 50 hPa. This correla-\ntion maximises between 85 and 105 km at a lag of 16 \u00b1\n4 months, with the mesospheric wind data preceding the\nQBO data; this is equivalent to the MQBO. The difference\nclimatology quantifies this effect for the zonal wind anoma-\nlies and shows that it maximises between June and August\nabove 85 km, with a difference of up to 2.6 m\/s between\nwesterly and easterly MQBO phases.\n[25] In spring, correlations maximise in the mesosphere at\nlags of \u00036 months, equivalent to the stratospheric QBO at\n\u000225 hPa. They also show an eastward enhancement of polar\nmesospheric wind anomalies but under westerly stratospheric\nQBO.\n[26] The observations support the hypothesis that the\nwinds are modulated by action of the equatorial QBO on\nplanetary wave propagation. In winter, a westerly MQBO\nwill allow mesospheric planetary waves to cross the equator\nto the opposite hemisphere, thus reducing the mesospheric\nplanetary wave activity so that the vortex-related winds in\nthe mesosphere will be stronger. The simultaneous easterly\nQBO in the stratosphere will increase stratospheric plane-\ntary wave activity so that the vortex in the stratosphere will\nweaken \u2013 this stratospheric signature is the Holton-Tan\neffect. In spring however, a westerly stratospheric QBO will\ndecrease polar stratospheric planetary wave activity and\nstrengthen the winds in the stratosphere. The simultaneous\neasterly MQBO will also reduce mesospheric planetary\nwave activity because the waves will be blocked from\ncrossing from the opposite (autumn) hemisphere. Hence\nthe mesospheric winds will also be strengthened.\n[27] Acknowledgments.
