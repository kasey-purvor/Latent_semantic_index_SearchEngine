Norman, MD, FRCOG,\nand Siladitya Bhattacharya, MD, FRCOG\nOBJECTIVE: To assess inherited predisposition to spon-\ntaneous preterm delivery.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, intergen-\nerational data on deliveries in mother\u2013daughter pairs\nwere analyzed from the Aberdeen Maternity Neonatal\nDatabank using multilevel logistic regression. The study\nincluded an exposed cohort of all women born sponta-\nneously preterm or whose mothers had experienced at\nleast one spontaneous preterm delivery (at 24\u201337 weeks\nof gestation). The unexposed cohort included women\nwho were born at term (after 37 weeks of gestation) or\nthose whose mothers had never experienced any spon-\ntaneous preterm deliveries (24\u201337 weeks of gestation).\nThe primary outcome was spontaneous preterm delivery\nin the daughters\u2019 pregnancies. Results are shown as\nadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals\n(CIs).\nRESULTS: We identified 22,343 pregnancies occurring in\n13,845 daughters born to 11,576 mothers. Women who\nwere born spontaneously preterm had significantly\nhigher odds of delivering preterm babies (OR 1.49, 95%\nCI 1.12\u20131.99). A stronger association was seen when the\nanalysis was restricted to nulliparous women who had\nbeen born spontaneously preterm (OR 1.60, 95% CI\n1.16\u20132.21). Other predictors of a woman having a spon-\ntaneous preterm delivery were age at delivery younger\nthan 20 years (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.43\u20131.94), lower socio-\neconomic status (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.44), smoking\nmore than 10 cigarettes per day (OR 1.47, 95% CI\n1.27\u20131.71), body mass index 19 kg\/m2 or less (OR 1.48,\n95% CI 1.24\u20131.77), previous preterm delivery (OR 2.51,\n95% CI 1.71\u20133.66). The risk of a woman delivering spon-\ntaneously preterm was increased even if her mother had\na history of spontaneous preterm delivery in any other\npregnancy (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.12\u20131.63). The absolute risk\nof spontaneously delivering preterm in women who were\nborn preterm was 9% as opposed to 6.2% in those who\nwere born full-term. This gives an increase in risk of\nspontaneous preterm birth of 2.8% in women who were\nborn spontaneously preterm.\nCONCLUSION: Women born spontaneously preterm or\nwith siblings delivered in a similar manner have an\nincreased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery in their\nown pregnancies.\n(Obstet Gynecol 2010;115:1125\u201333)\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II\nPreterm birth is the leading cause of perinatalmorbidity and mortality1 in the developed world,\ncosting society $26 billion per year.2 It accounts for\n60% of deaths in babies and serious complications\nafter delivery,3 such as cerebral palsy. Spontaneous\npreterm birth refers to any delivery between 24 and\n37 weeks of gestation in the absence of induced labor\nor elective cesarean delivery,4 and it occurs in 7% of\nall deliveries in the United Kingdom.5 Elsewhere,\nincluding the United States, it has been reported in\n12% to 13% of all births, 6,7 representing an increase of\n30% since 1981.

Although many causes of preterm birth have\nbeen identified, including infection (both genital and\nsystemic) and multiple pregnancy, the reasons behind\nmost spontaneous preterm births remain unknown.9\nInterventions for prevention of this condition have\nbeen unsuccessful, with the possible exception of\ncervical cerclage1 and use of progesterone.10,11\nSpontaneous preterm birth results from a com-\nplex interaction of genetic, environmental, social, and\nbehavioral factors. Several lines of evidence support a\ngenetic predisposition to spontaneous preterm birth.12\nA single spontaneous preterm birth has a 15% risk of\nrecurrence in a future pregnancy, increasing to 32%3\nafter two previous episodes. There is clear evidence of\nracial predisposition,13 with blacks facing a 17% risk of\nspontaneous preterm birth as opposed to 10% in\nwhites.14 Spontaneous preterm birth can also run in\nfamilies,5 although the evidence surrounding this is\nconflicting.\nA literature search on preterm birth and its\nrecurrence across the generations was performed\nusing Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases (1990\u2013\n2006). A number of studies were identified.15\u201321 Most\naddressed the association between perinatal factors\nand preterm birth, but few explored intergenerational\ninfluences. In this retrospective cohort study, we\nhypothesized that women whose mothers had spon-\ntaneously given birth preterm were at higher risk for\nhaving a similar birth event in their own pregnancies.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nOur study was based on routinely collected data on all\nsingleton deliveries occurring in mother\u2013daughter\npairs as recorded in the Aberdeen Maternity Neona-\ntal Databank (http:\/\/www.abdn.ac.uk\/amnd) using a\nretrospective cohort study design. The exposed co-\nhort comprised women (\u201cdaughters\u201d) who were either\nborn spontaneously preterm or had mothers who had\nhad a spontaneous preterm delivery (24\u201337 weeks) in\nany pregnancy. The unexposed cohort included all\nwomen (\u201cdaughters\u201d) who were born at term (greater\nthan 37 weeks of gestation) or whose mothers had\nnever experienced any spontaneous preterm deliver-\nies (24\u201337 weeks of gestation).\nThe primary outcome was spontaneous preterm\ndelivery in the daughters\u2019 pregnancies. Because the\nmechanisms of preterm birth in twins and higher-order\nmultiple pregnancies are potentially different from that\nof singletons, we excluded the former from all analyses.\nWomen who had induction of labor or elective cesarean\ndelivery were also excluded from the analysis.\nAfter approval by the steering committee of the\nAberdeen Maternity Neonatal Databank, who are the\nCaldicott guardians of the data, an anonymous data\nset was provided to the researchers. Because all\nanalyses were performed on a data set stripped of\nidentifiers, the North of Scotland Research Ethics\nService was of the opinion that formal Ethics approval\nwas not required. Our methods incorporated guide-\nlines12 based on a review of genetic epidemiologic\nstudies of preterm birth.\nWithin the Scientific Information Retrieval sys-\ntem used for data capture, relatives are identified as\nmother\u2013daughter pairs by matching the mother\u2019s\nsurname and date of delivery to the daughter\u2019s\nmaiden name and date of birth. New York State\nIdentification and Intelligence Systems (Albany, NY,\n1970) and SOUNDEX (Russell and Odell, 1918) were\nutilized for identifying names that are similar.\nWhereas probability matching is utilized for the\nmatching of names, only exact matches are accepted\nfor the dates of birth. The data set used for this study\nrecorded deliveries in two generations between Sep-\ntember 1948 and March 2008. Since the inception of\nthe Aberdeen Maternity Neonatal Databank, the\nnumbers of such intergenerational pairs have in-\ncreased and now include data on older women who\ngave birth several decades ago. It is now feasible to\nidentify three-generation families, because those\nwomen identified as daughters have now become\nmothers, thus enabling identification of grandmothers\nand granddaughters. The current limitation of link-\nages over three generations is that the data set is\nsomewhat biased toward women who reproduce\nearly in life because their pregnancy details are inev-\nitably available earlier than those for women who\nhave children later in life.\nGestational age is recorded as a continuous variable\naccording to the date of the last menstrual period as\nreported by women and then confirmed or refuted by\nultrasonography (since 1986). Because most of the data\npre-date routine use of ultrasound scans in pregnancy,\ngestational age is mostly calculated according to dates.\nThis variable was recoded, for some analyses, into a\nbinary variable, ie, those who were born preterm,\n(before 37 completed weeks of gestation) and those who\nwere not. Certainty of gestation is recorded inmore than\n99% of women and works as a data quality check.\nSince its inception, data have been concurrently\nentered into the Aberdeen Maternity Neonatal Data-\n1126 Bhattacharya et al Inherited Preterm Delivery OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY\nbank. Labor is classified as spontaneous, induced, or\nelective cesarean delivery without labor. Reasons for\ninduction of labor are clearly documented according\nto a prespecified code.\nThe classification of preeclampsia is based on\nthe classification of hypertensive disorders of preg-\nnancy by Davey and MacGillivray,22 which has\nbeen used throughout in the Aberdeen Maternity\nNeonatal Databank. Before the publication of this\narticle, Nelson\u2019s23 classification was used. The two\nclassification systems are very similar and, for\npurposes of epidemiological analyses, may be used\ninterchangeably.\nGestational hypertension is defined as a diastolic\nblood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more on any one\noccasion or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or\nmore on any two or more occasions at least 4 hours\napart. Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension with\nproteinuria of 300 mg\/24 hours or more or protein-\nuria found in two urine specimens collected at least 4\nhours apart. Birth weight is recorded (in grams) as a\ncontinuous variable in the Aberdeen Maternity Neo-\nnatal Databank.\nSocial class is based on the husband\u2019s or partner\u2019s\noccupation and coded in the Aberdeen Maternity\nNeonatal Databank according to the British Registrar\nGeneral\u2019s occupational social class classification of\n1951, for which there are six categories: I, profes-\nsional; II, managerial; III, skilled nonmanual; IV,\nskilled manual; V, semi-skilled; and VI, unskilled.\nWomen\u2019s own social classes were used when there\nwas no available information for the partner.\nBody mass index is calculated using the formula\nweight in kilograms divided by height in meters\nsquared. The height and weight used are those mea-\nsured and recorded by clinical staff at the first ante-\nnatal booking visit at less than 20 weeks of gestation.\nOther variables include self-reported smoking habits\n(recorded during antenatal clerking as the number of\ncigarettes smoked per day).\nBecause of the nature of the ethnic population\nresident in the northeast of Scotland over the past 60\nyears, this cohort comprises white women only. Thus,\nethnicity is not considered as a covariate in the analyses.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nSTATA version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\nThe initial analyses were performed on nulliparous\nwomen, and a multiple logistic regression model was\nused to examine the relationship between a woman\u2019s\n(daughter\u2019s) characteristics and the chance of her\nhaving a spontaneous preterm birth. We adjusted for\nconfounding variables such as the woman\u2019s age at\ndelivery, social class, smoking, preeclampsia, and\nhistory of preterm delivery. The analysis was stratified\nby parity. Mixed-effect modeling24 was used to allow\nfor the clustering of pregnancies within daughters,\ndaughters within mothers, and so on. Although each\nwoman could have had several pregnancies, the\ncharacteristics of her mother and grandmother would\nremain unchanged for each of them. Therefore, preg-\nnancies were nested within women (daughters) who\nwere themselves nested within their mothers. Because\nthe primary outcome (spontaneous preterm birth) was\nbinary, a multilevel logistic regression analysis was\nused to examine the interrelationship between a\ndaughter\u2019s characteristics and her mother\u2019s and\ngrandmother\u2019s characteristics at the time of the\ndaughter\u2019s birth, and the risk of spontaneous preterm\nbirth in the daughter. Specifically, a two-level hierar-\nchical analysis was used to explore the interrelation-\nship between a daughter\u2019s pregnancy-related charac-\nteristics, her mother\u2019s characteristics at the time of her\n(the daughter\u2019s) birth, and the probability of sponta-\nneous preterm birth in the daughter. The strength of\nassociation of each characteristic is reported using\nunadjusted and then multiadjusted odds ratios (ORs)\nand 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For each variable,\nmissing values were kept as a separate category to\nmaximize numbers and the resultant statistical power\nfor analysis.\nPotential confounders were included at two levels\nand coded for daughters and mothers. For daughters,\nage at delivery (19 or younger, 20\u201335, and 36 years or\nolder), social class (groups I to III and groups IV and V),\nand smoking status (none, 1\u20139 cigarettes\/day, and 10 or\nmore cigarettes\/day) were recorded. Bodymass index at\nexamination (19 or less, 20\u201324, 25\u201329, and 30 or\ngreater)24 and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy\n(coded into three groups: none, preeclampsia, and ges-\ntational hypertension), spontaneous preterm birth, his-\ntory of miscarriage, and history of preterm delivery and\nparity (all yes and no) were also included.\nFor mothers, age at delivery (19 or younger,\n20\u201335, and 36 years or older), social class (groups I to\nIII and groups IV and V), preeclampsia (coded into\nthree groups: yes, no, and gestational hypertension),\npreterm birth of any daughter (yes and no), preterm\nbirth of index daughter (yes and no), and history of\nmiscarriage and parity were included.\nSTATA version 10 was used for the analysis;\nP\u0001.05 was used to denote statistical significance\nthroughout.\nRESULTS\nA total of 35,096 pregnancy records of women\n(daughters) were available for analysis. Because our\nVOL. 115, NO. 6, JUNE 2010 Bhattacharya et al Inherited Preterm Delivery 1127\nfocus was on spontaneous preterm birth, deliveries\nafter induced labor (n\u00019,521) and elective cesarean\ndelivery (n\u00011,716) were excluded.

Consistent coding criteria are used and intermit-\ntent checks are performed to ensure data quality.27 The\ndata collected allow researchers to distinguish between\nspontaneous and iatrogenic preterm labor. None of the\nstudies identified on an extensive literature search has\nbeen able to adjust for conditions, such as preeclampsia,\nthat have established intergenerational associations and\ncan result in iatrogenic or spontaneous preterm delivery.\nThe current analysis takes into account the clustering of\nevents within individual women as well as in families,\nthereby making the results more robust and easier to\ninterpret, without any loss of power. We were unable to\nstratify the risks of very preterm delivery (less than 32\nweeks of gestation) compared with late preterm delivery\nbecause there were insufficient cases of the former in our\ndata set to allow a meaningful breakdown of the data.\nThe main limitations of this study relate to its\nretrospective longitudinal nature. The data have been\ncollected over six decades that have witnessed sub-\nstantial changes in clinical practice, especially neona-\ntal intensive care. This is reflected in the difference in\nproportion of preterm deliveries recorded in the two\ngenerations. Over the years, access to better neonatal\nand pediatric care has increased the chances of\nwomen born preterm living to adulthood and having\npregnancies of their own. The Aberdeen Maternity\nNeonatal Databank only has pregnancy records of\ndaughters who have had a pregnancy themselves and\nexcludes any who may have been born preterm but\nhave not lived long enough to bear children. This\nmay also partially explain the increased rates of\npreterm delivery in daughters, which could introduce\na degree of ascertainment bias. The other limitation of\nthis study concerns the definition of \u201cpreterm deliv-\nery.\u201d Because much of our data predate routine use of\nultrasonography, the gestational age and, therefore,\nthe definition of preterm delivery, have been based\non self-reported dates of the last menstrual period.\nThere have been few intergenerational studies on\nspontaneous preterm birth. Porter and Fraser18 re-\nported the odds (95% CI) of spontaneous preterm\nbirth in white women who were delivered prema-\nturely as 1.18 (95% CI 1.02\u20131.37). However, these\ndata were obtained through birth certificate records;\ndetailed obstetric information was lacking and inac-\ncuracies in documenting gestation and birth weight\ncannot be ruled out. Cesarean deliveries (including\nemergency cesarean deliveries in women in preterm\nlabor) were systematically excluded, possibly result-\ning in loss of a significant amount of data and possibly\nintroducing potential bias. The study included 1,405\nmothers who were born spontaneously preterm and\n2,781 who were not. This study, which was based on\na larger sample and was able to adjust for confound-\ning factors, found a stronger association between\nbeing born spontaneously preterm and subsequent\nrisk of experiencing a spontaneous preterm birth.\nWinkvist and Mogren20 analyzed gestational\nlength and types of growth restriction in 4,746 gener-\nation pairs and found a trend toward an increased risk\nof any kind of preterm birth (OR 1.82, 95% CI\n0.87\u20133.82) in daughters who had been small for\ngestational age but not those born preterm (OR 1.10,\n95% CI 0.69\u20131.76). This study was unable to distin-\nguish spontaneous from induced preterm labor. Data\nwere extracted from obstetric medical notes, but\nconfounders such as smoking and body mass index\nwere not taken into account.\nSelling et al19 showed that after adjustment for body\nmass index, smoking, and socioeconomic status, women\nyounger than 28 years who had been born small for\ngestational age were at increased risk of having a small-\nfor-gestational age neonate (OR 2.68, 95%CI 2.11\u20133.41)\nbut not for preterm birth (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70\u20131.64),\nspontaneous or induced. This study had a sample size of\n807 daughters who were born preterm.\nDifferences in study populations and outcomes\nmeasured in these studies make a direct comparison\nwith our findings difficult. Nevertheless, in contrast to\nthe studies by Winkivist et al20 and Selling et al,19 in our\nstudy we found a definite increased risk of spontaneous\npreterm birth in women whose mothers had a similar\ntype of delivery. Unlike these studies, we did not look at\nthe intergenerational effect of growth restriction on\npreterm delivery.\nVOL. 115, NO. 6, JUNE 2010 Bhattacharya et al Inherited Preterm Delivery 1131\nMore recently, in a study based on data from the\nNorwegian Birth Registry, Wilcox et al28 investigated\nthe risk of preterm birth in the female offspring, in which\neither the mother or the father was born preterm. The\nrelative risk of preterm delivery in a daughter was 1.54\n(95% CI 1.42\u20131.67) if the mother was born preterm and\nslightly less if the father was born preterm. The analysis\nwas restricted to first deliveries only. The main analysis\nincluded all preterm deliveries, both spontaneous and\ninduced; however, when induced preterm deliveries\nwere excluded, the association was strengthened. The\nrisks of preterm delivery inherited from the mother\nreported in this Norwegian study are more consistent\nwith our findings.\nPrevious publications resulting from analysis of the\nintergenerational cohort within the AberdeenMaternity\nNeonatal Databank were restricted in the numbers29 of\nmother\u2013daughter pairs. For example, only 505 mother\u2013\ndaughter pairs were available for analysis in this study\nlooking at inheritance of birth weight in which a small\ninherited influence was demonstrated.29\nManagement of spontaneous preterm labor has\nmainly relied on interventions to delay delivery long\nenough to allow antenatal corticosteroid administration.\nAlthough these have reduced perinatal mortality and\nmorbidity, it is necessary to understand the causes of\nspontaneous preterm birth and identify populations at\nrisk before any targeted therapeutic interventions can be\nplanned. Accurate prediction of risk may help in plan-\nning appropriate antenatal care in women deemed to be\nat high risk. Our study adds to the general body of\nepidemiological evidence suggesting genetic predisposi-\ntion to preterm birth and highlights the inherited con-\ntribution toward spontaneous preterm birth in the con-\ntext of known environmental factors, like smoking and\nsocial class. Recent publications have identified path-\nways for epigenetic regulation of spontaneous preterm\nbirth. Changes in the expression of specific micro-RNAs\nin the myometrium in spontaneous labor at term have\nalso been demonstrated30 to help explain the biological\nmechanism of spontaneous preterm birth. Further re-\nsearch should focus on the identification of candidate\ngenes for the condition, effects of \u201cimprinting\u201d via\nfactors responsible for preterm birth in the previous\ngeneration, and efficacy of interventions such as proges-\nterone in women at high risk.\nREFERENCES\n1.
