Traffic, Cache, Internet, Users\n1.Introduction.\nHTTP caching has been shown to deliver considerable benefits in network utilisation and\nuser perceived performance [3, 1].  In order to optimise the benefits it is important to\ndevelop accurate models of cache behaviour.  To our knowledge, accurate models have\nyet to be fully defined.  The performance of HTTP cache servers varies dramatically from\nserver to server and invariants have proved hard to identify.  Much of the observed\nvariability is independent of cache size [6] and network topology [2] and appears to be\nrelated to differences in the user communities of the caches.  It therefore seems desirable\nto develop a good model of user behaviour.  Unfortunately studies of the behaviour of\nindividual users are not readily available.  This is probably because it is not possible to\nanalyse the behaviour of anything other than large (atypical) groups of users in the\nanonymised statistics published by some cache operators [e.g.\nftp:\/\/ircache.nlanr.net\/Traces\/].  In order to build reliable statistics it is necessary to\nobtain long-term traces for small and medium users.  If user request rates follow a single\nsided distribution, like many cache parameters, the smallest users will be by far the most\nnumerous and will dominate results.  However, if users request rates follow a Poisson\ndistribution (as do telephony call rates [5]), it will be safe to ignore the smallest users.\nIn this paper we report the first results from a study of individual user behaviour that we\nhave undertaken.  In section 2 we illustrate the analysis that is possible using the\npublished daily statistics from a large cache, and show that there is strong evidence that\nuser request rates are Poisson.  In section 3 we report some longer-term results for single\nusers from several different caches, and show for the first time that large and moderate\nindividual users have highly variable hit rates, Zipf locality curves and exhibit long range\ndependency.  The smallest users do not generate large enough samples to enable\nmeaningful analysis.  In section 4 a simple model is proposed which models individual\nusers using only key cache performance parameters.  Although this model is based on the\nbehaviour of large and moderate users, it should generate reasonable predictions since the\ndistribution of user request rates is not single sided and the smallest users can be safely\nignored.  In section 5 we illustrate how this simple model could be used to predict cache\nperformance, and propose an empirical constant representing the fact that cache user\ncommunities are not random selections from the total user community.\n2. Analysis of Daily statistics\nThe clearest link to user choices and behaviour in published cache statistics is the host\npopularity curve (or locality plot).  This curve plots the number of requests for files from\na given site, against the popularity ranking of the site.  Previous studies [6] have shown\nthat the curve usually approximates to Zipf\u2019s law. Zipf's First Law [11] states that if the\nfrequencies of occurrence of each item are ranked by frequency then the frequency of the\nsecond most popular item will be half the frequency of the most common item. The\nfrequency of the third most popular item will be proportional to a third of the frequency\nof the most popular, and so on. That is:\nFrequency of RankingN = (Frequency of Ranking1)\/N\nIn order to get a clear picture of user activity however, it is necessary to know the target\nfile for each request, rather than just the target host.  This is because some users could\naccess a large range of files on a small range of hosts, and some users could repeatedly\naccess a small range of files on the same range of hosts.  This would lead to identical\npopularity curves but very different results for metrics such as hit rate, and number of\ncached files.  Unfortunately the statistics published by most caches do not provide any\ndetail of the files accessed by individual users.  However, we were able to obtain a log\nwhich reported the target URL for each request, from the operators of the Funet (Finnish\nUniversity and Research Network) cache in Finland [http:\/\/www.funet.fi\/funet\/]. The\nFunet cache is a primary cache serving universities, polytechnics and some research\norganisations in Finland.  The cache has about 2500 users, 500000 requests per day, a hit\nrate of ~30% and a popularity curve which is approximately Zipf. The cache appears, on\nthese metrics, to be similar to many primary caches run by other universities or groups of\nacademic institutions [e.g. http:\/\/www.swin.edu.au\/proxy\/usage\/]. The analysis reported\nin this section is based on a log file for a single days activity, obtained from Finland.\nAnalysis over a longer period was not possible as the logs are anonymised on a daily\nbasis.  In addition, many of the logged file requests are automatically generated by\nembedded objects such as .gif files, rather than by the user.  As we are attempting to\nanalyse user behaviour rather than the composition of web pages we have attempted to\neliminate the auto-generated requests from the analysis.  Therefore all requests which\noccurred within a second of the previous request and were made to the same host as the\nprevious request have been filtered out of the data.\nFigure 1 shows the user community of the cache sorted by number of requests generated\nin a single day (20\/1\/98).  The logarithmic distribution of request rates is approximately\nPoisson with a mean of 101 requests (where the mean is defined as the inverse log of the\nmean of the logarithmic distribution).  This observation means we can build a model\nwithout requiring analysis of the smallest users.  We will, however, need to build up a\ndetailed understanding of users generating around 100 requests per day.\n0\n5 0\n1 0 0\n1 5 0\n2 0 0\n2 5 0\n3 0 0\n3 5 0\n4 0 0\nFigure 1.  Distribution of user request rates on the Funet cache.\nFigure 2 shows the host popularity data for the largest two users of the cache.  A line with\nthe gradient of Zipf\u2019s law is also shown as an aid to the eye.  It is apparent that user 1\n(no.of requests) visits fewer hosts than user 2 (no.of requests), and that whilst user 1\napproximately follows Zipf\u2019s law user 2 does not.  In fact user 2 shows weaker locality\nsince his most popular sites are less popular than Zipf would predict. We chose to analyse\nlarge users at this stage because it was more practical and resulting statistics would be\nmore sound.\nAnalysis of requests made over one day are not ideal, common sense would suggest that\ndata from only one day will consistently underestimate the locality shown by users\nbecause daily visits to sites (e.g. news sites) will not be represented.  Secondly smaller\nusers generate samples which are too small after only one day, so the selection of users\nfrom a daily log can never be fully representative.\n0.01%\n0.10%\n1.00%\n10.00%\n100.00%\n1 10 100 1000 10000\nRanking\nBigUser1-host\nBigUser2-host\nZipf\nFigure 2.   Popularity curve for hosts accessed by two users of the Finland cache.\nIn order to illustrate the need for data on file requests rather than just the usual data on\nhost requests, the file request popularity curve for the same two users is shown in Figure\n3, again with the Zipf gradient shown as an aid. It is clear that user 1 is visiting more\npages than user 2, even though he visited fewer hosts, illustrating the importance of the\nfile data.  It is also clear that page request popularity does not follow Zipf\u2019s law, since\nboth curves now show less locality than Zipf would predict.  The reason for this is likely\nto be that data has only been analysed for one day and thus the popularity of the most\nfrequently visited sites has been underestimated as discussed above.  It also important to\nnote that the request gradient for hosts will always be steeper than files because the\nformer is usually an aggregate of the latter.  This means that there is always more files\nrequested than hosts visited and the most popular host is always more popular than the\nmost popular file.\n0.01%\n0.10%\n1.00%\n10.00%\n100.00%\n1 10 100 1000 10000\nRanking\nBigUser1-Uri\nBigUser2-uri\nZipf\nFigure 3.  Popularity curves for files accessed by two users of the Finland cache.\nEven with access to the file request data from the Funet cache we are unable to draw any\nstrong conclusions.  The reasons can be summarised as follows:\n1) Only large users generate enough requests to be worthy of analysis and they are\nnot likely to be representative of smaller users.\n2) A user identity cannot be traced for long time periods since the data is freshly\nanonymised on a daily basis.  This is particularly important as there is likely to be\nsignificant long range dependency in user activity based on the users memory\nwhich will be lost if only the activity of a single day is analysed.\nIn an attempt to overcome these issues we have assembled long term data sets from a\nrange of caches.  The initial analysis of some of the data is reported in section 3 below.\n3.Analysis of long term statistics\nThe cache which is the source of the majority of the data presented in this section has\nbeen used by 5 individuals over the course of a year.  The cache is small since only users\nwho are members of our research team, and are happy for their logs to be analysed in\nnon-anonymised form have been encouraged to use it.  Over a 26-week period (25\/8\/97 \u2013\n22\/2\/98) the cache generated 14000 requests and sustained a hit rate of around 20%.  The\ncache is sited at the subnet router for the team\u2019s network and is thus caching requests to\nsites in other buildings on the local Intranet.  These local requests do not appear in the\ndata for larger caches and should possibly be eliminated.  In this paper these requests\nhave not been eliminated as it is difficult to know where to stop eliminating sites from a\nglobal Intranet such as that operated by BT.  We do not feel that the local requests\nsignificantly alter the principal findings of the work.\nClient 1\nrequests 6545\nhosts 389\nuri 3535\nhit rate 24.04%\nRequests on Busiest Day 345\nNumber of  Distinct Hosts on Busiest Day 27\nNumber of distinct URL's on Busiest Day 240\nTable 1. Users statistics for biggest user of small scale cache.\nTable 1 shows the usage statistics of the most consistent user of the cache over the 26-\nweek period.  This user was using the WWW through the cache whilst in the office,\nprimarily as a research tool.\nOn days when the WWW was used the user spent between one and three hours browsing\nand generated up to 345 page requests in a session.  The typical number of initial page\nrequests (auto generated requests for embedded files have been filtered as above) on a\nworking day was 100.  This places the user in the most probable part of the usage\ndistribution observed on the Finland cache.  One cannot on this basis alone claim that the\nuser is representative, but at least we can be sure we are analysing a user with significant\ndifferences to the users analysed in section 2.\nOn the basis of the amount of time this user spent in WWW based activity it seems\nunlikely that the requests attributed to the heavy users on the Finland cache were entirely\ngenerated by single human end users.  14% of the requests generated by our user were\nactually automated requests.  The user was using Internet explorer and has experimented\nwith the subscription mechanisms this browser provides.  In the 26 week period the user\nhad 6 subscriptions for a period of about one month.  One of the subscriptions was\nchecking the currency of bookmarked pages.  Had these subscriptions been extended over\nthe entire 26 weeks 50% of the traffic would have been \u201crobot\u201d generated.  It is\nconceivable that an enthusiastic subscription user would have a much higher proportion\nof robot traffic.

The 10 most popular hosts for 3 users.\nAs expected from previous reports [8] the favourite sites for our moderate user include a\nlocal directory, some intranet pages, some news pages, some experimental research\nactivity, and developer sites of large software companies.  On the other hand the popular\nsites list for Finland user 1 is heavily biased towards the sites which are default\nsubscriptions in internet explorer.  This tends to support a supposition that some high\nrequest rates are robot assisted.  It also leads us to question the benefits of the\nsubscription mechanism which is potentially increasing web traffic by up to an order of\nmagnitude.  It is possible that Finland user 2 is a small subsidiary cache.\n0 .01\n0 .1\n1\n10\n100\n1 10 100 1000\nrank ing\n1w eek\n4w eeks\n24w eeks\nZ ip f\nFigure 4.  Comparison of popularity curves over different timespans.\nFigure 4 shows the host popularity data for our cache analysed over progressively\nincreasing periods of 1 week, one month and 6 months.  As the sample size and time\nperiod increase the results tend towards following Zipf\u2019s law.  It is not clear whether this\nis an artifact of small sample sizes or whether it indicates a very long-range dependency\nof more than 6 months.  It is to be expected that there will be significant self-similarity at\nlong timescales as the users' memory and interests are quite persistent, but it is also clear\nthat for less popular sites the statistics will be very poor.\nFigure 5 compares the page popularity curves for the two Finland users and for our local\nuser (with auto generated requests filtered as before). It is clear from figure 6 that our\nlocal, moderate user has a popularity curve with a similar gradient to that of Finland user\n2, but Finland user 1 has a curve with a steeper gradient.  Despite the results being taken\nover a longer time period, our user still exhibits less locality than would be predicted by\nZipf\u2019s law.  We suspect that this may be because the lifetime of pages is significantly\nshorter than that of sites so the usage of the most popular pages cannot build up over long\nperiods as it does for the most popular sites.  It is equally possible that it is simply\nbecause our user is different.  To resolve this question we analysed some long term user\ntraces obtained from other sites.\n0.01%\n0.10%\n1.00%\n10.00%\n100.00%\n1 10 100 1000 10000\nRanking\nBT User-Uri\nBigUser1-Uri\nBigUser2-uri\nFigure 5.  Popularity curves of three users at two sites.\nFigure 6 shows the variance of the \u201cauto hit rate\u201d generated by a range of users plotted\nagainst sample size.  We are confident that all the users plotted in this figure are genuine\nindividual users.  One user is the BT user analysed above. One additional user is derived\nfrom traces collected in 1995 at Boston University [6].  The remaining users are drawn\nfrom early analysis of logs provided by Research Machines plc (RMPLC).  RMPLC\n[http:\/\/www.rmplc.net] is an internet service and content provider to schools and colleges\nin the UK, they also have a small number of modem users who are assigned a static IP\naddress. We analysed the hit rate statistics of two of the modem users, during a period of\n6 weeks in early 1998.  All of the users are generating around 100 requests per day, and\nare thus near the peak of the request rate distribution found in the Finland data.\nThe \u201cauto hit rate\u201d is the rate of request for files previously requested by the user and\nsuccessfully cached.  As observed elsewhere [10], for the aggregate hit rate on much\nlarger caches, the variance does not decay rapidly with sample size.  The curves are\nclearly linear and the Hurst parameters can be estimated from the data and fall in the\nrange 0.55 \u2013 0.7 (with estimation errors of 0.1 due to the use of small samples).  All the\nusers we have analysed thus exhibit the statistical anomalies that have been interpreted\nelsewhere as self similarity [6].  The data presented does not prove self similarity in a\nstrict mathematical sense as the range of the curves is small, due to the small sample\nsizes.  However, the data is sufficient to demonstrate, for the first time, that individual\nusers exhibit the same anomalies as caches.  The anomalies can be safely interpreted as a\ntype of long range dependency, which we postulate originates in the memory of the users.\nFigure 6.  Decline in hit rate variance with increasing sample size.\nIt is clear from fig. 6 that the BT user is not obviously atypical.  It is also clear that\nthe hit rates of the users are just as variable as those of caches [10] and fall in a\nremarkably similar range (16% - 65%).  Use of long term traces has thus enabled us\nto find that (at least large and moderate) users have hit rates, locality curves and long\nrange dependency, all of which are indistinguishable from those of caches.\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\n10 100 1000 10000\nRequests\nBT Client\nH = 0.7\nHit rate ~24%\nBU Client\nH = 0.55\nAuto hit rate ~ 65%\nRMPLC Client\nH = 0.6\nHit Rate ~16%\nRMPLC Client\nH =0.66\nHit Rate ~40%\n0 .0 0%\n5.0 0%\n1 0.0 0%\n1 5.0 0%\n2 0.0 0%\n2 5.0 0%\n3 0.0 0%\nFigure 7.  Change in theoretical hit rate over 10 working days.\nIn figure 7 we show the build up of the auto hit rate of the BT user with time.  The rate\nplateaus after just over 1 working week, indicating that the characteristic time of the\ndominant long-range dependency should be around 1 week.  The data also indicates that\nthe ideal length of user trace is at least 1 week even for large users.  For moderate users\nwith ~100 requests per day a 25 day sample would be ideal to overcome stochastic\neffects.  Users with 20 requests per day would ideally require a 6 month long trace.\nUsers with less than 10 requests\/day will be hard to analyse accurately as the sample\nwould need to be 250 days long, i.e. it would exceed the typical lifetime of web pages.\nHowever since these users represent the tail of the distribution and have minimal impact\non cache performance they can almost certainly be safely ignored.\nBased on the results reported in sections 2 and 3 we now move on to propose a simple\nmodel of users\n4. User model\nThe simplest conceivable model of a web user has one assumption and one parameter.\nThe assumption is that page popularity will follow Zipf\u2019s law as do other popularity\ncurves for human beings [4].  The parameter is usage level. The results we have reported\nindicate that this is not sufficient to explain the variability of user behaviour \u2013 since in\npractice the users do not follow Zipf\u2019s law (although they do appear to follow a heavy\ntailed Pareto curve), and they have highly variable hit rates.  In addition it is clear that\nusers are a significant source of long range dependency.  This leads us to the assertion\nthat at least 3 parameters are required to model the observed behaviour\n1) usage\n2) Auto hit rate\n3) Hurst parameter derived from auto hit rate\nOf course for modelling situations where the burstiness is not important the third\nparameter can be neglected and we are left with a simple two-parameter model\nAuto hit rate is chosen as the second parameter because it is the most obvious single\nnumber metric for the locality of users requests, and it has no dependencies on other users\nor the properties of the WWW.  In addition it is plausible to argue that it will show a\ndistribution with a well defined maximum likelihood, as does the usage parameter.  In the\nnext section we illustrate how a user model based on the above parameters can be used to\npredict cache performance.\n5. Community model\nBased on a two parameter user model as proposed in section 4 and additional input from\nthe observations we can propose a method for building user community models.  This\nmethod is intended as an illustration of our objectives rather than as a definitive proposal\ndue to the small amount of data available.\nAssumptions\n1) the distribution of request rates is Poisson with a mean of 101 as observed in the\nFinland data\n2) the distribution of auto hit rates is Poisson with a mean of 0.2 (the observed auto\nhit rates of our user) and independent of request rate\nIf the community is mostly human the above assumptions are likely to be true.  However\nif there is a substantial proportion of robot traffic there are likely to be at least two\nindependent distributions with different means.  The impact of robots will be the subject\nof a further study.\nSince we have assumed Poisson distributions it is sufficient to have studied users enough\nto characterise the means of the above distributions accurately.  The community model is\nnot dependent on individual user properties.  However, we also need a characterising\nparameter \u2013 the degree of overlap between users in a given community.  This parameter\nis required because communities are not random samples from the overall user\npopulation, but are subject to strong locational bias.  Examples of bias include factors like\nlanguage, dominant local industries and demographics (small towns with universities are\ndominated by single people in their early twenties).  We propose an overlap parameter,\n\u03d6,=which can be derived empirically using\n( )tratemeanautohitratemeanrequestratemeanrequesofusersno\nsworkingdaygesofcachedpaobservedno\n\u00d7\u2212\u00d7\n\u00f7\n\u2212=\n.\n.1\u03d6    (1)\nWe anticipate that caches with similar user communities will have very similar values for\n\u03d6,=and that \u03d6 will have a useful probability distribution, which can be treated as the sum\nof the distributions for \u03d6 for a small set of community types (e.g. researchers, home\nusers, business users, robots, mixed).  Each type represents a different mixture of user\nobjectives, and should thus represent a defined market sector for WWW products.  We\nare currently attempting to calculate \u03d6 for a wide range of caches with published data in\norder to validate this hypothesis.\n\u03d6=can be used to make predictions, for example it can be shown that:\n( ) ( )eautohitrattratemeanrequestratemeanrequesofusersno\nofusersnotratemeanautohitratemeanrequesofhitsNo\n\u00d7\u2212\u00d7\u2212\u00d7+\n\u00d7\u00d7=\n1.\n..\n\u03d6\n(2)\nUsing meanrequestrate= 101\nmeanautohitrate = 0.2\nand taking observations from the Finland cache for observedno.of cachedpages =\n161628, workingdays = 1, and no.ofusers = 2284, we derive=\u03d6== 0.124\nApplying this value of \u03d6 to the Finland cache we get no.ofhits = 69010\nThe true value of no.of hits was 70999 so our model has predicted a reasonable answer.\n6. Conclusions\nBased on a preliminary analysis of user behaviour in daily cache logs and in long term\ntraces we have shown that individual users, with moderate daily request rates, exhibit hit\nrates, request locality and long range dependencies similar to those observed in caches.\nWe have also shown that user request rates follow a Poisson type distribution, so it is not\nnecessary to understand the behaviour of the small number of low level users as their\nrequests make up an insignificant proportion of overall requests to a cache.  Based on the\nobservations a simple model of users has been proposed, and we have illustrated how this\nmodel could be used.  A parameter was proposed to account for the systematic biases in\nthe membership of real cache user communities.  This parameter may be sufficient to\ncharacterise the observed differences between real caches.\n7.
