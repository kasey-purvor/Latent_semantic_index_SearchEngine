Uncertainty in the caring procedure arises mostly from incom-\nplete information about patient findings (i.e. the signs and symptoms) due to loss of sensation and\nmovement caused by the spinal cord injury. As a result, it may not be easy to assess the extent of\na condition \u2014 and, thus, make an accurate diagnosis. Bayesian Networks are used for diagnostic\nreasoning because they offer a way of conducting probabilistic inference about the conditions as-\nsociated with the caring procedure in the face of uncertainty. The network structure and numerical\nparameters are based on data elicited from the qualified staff nurses and literature of the National\nSpinal Injury Centre, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Aylesbury, UK. We also present the model and re-\nport the results of the diagnostic performance tests using the AgenaRisk Bayesian network package.\n1. Introduction\nThe quality of medical care has always been a key issue for both practitioners and patients; more\nthan ever though, it is seen as a crucial target to be met, since the highest standards and practice\nguidelines are expected in all fields of medicine. Decision Support Systems (DSS) are tools that\ncan ensure such quality care, as long as they are integrated into the daily routine. Investigation for\nusing DSS for assisting medical diagnosis date back to the late 1950s. The systems developed so\nfar use a variety of modelling approaches, which can be broadly divided in two main categories:\n\u2022 The rule-based approach, where inference is based on rule set. Uncertainty is usually ad-\ndressed via heuristic methods \u2014 making them ineffective in many real-world scenarios [5, 4].\n\u2022 The probabilistic approach, which benefits from both mathematical consistency and accuracy.\nIn particular, Bayesian Networks have been introduced in the 1980s as a formalism for modelling\nproblems involving uncertainty, adopting probability theory as a basic framework for reasoning\n[11]. Since then, researchers have been exploring the feasibility and performance of Bayesian\nNetworks in the context of medical applications [2]. Probabilistic dependencies and interactions\nbetween signs\/symptoms and possible diagnoses among the data can be easily described using a\nBayesian Network. Hence, they offer a natural way to represent the uncertainty that arises when\nattempting to deliver a diagnosis [7]. Thus, any probabilistic statement that concerns individual\nvariables or their combinations can be computed from a properly structured Bayesian network.\nThe motivation for development of a computer-based carer-advisor system is mainly that the\nnumber of experienced human carers for spinal injury patients is very limited, compared to the\nlarge number of such patients requiring care. Furthermore, many people who act as carers are not\nprofessionally trained, and largely learn as they go along. In addition, since such care commonly\ntakes place in the patient\u2019s home, experienced medical staff are rarely available.\nThe DIMITRA system [3] is a rule-based expert system for the caring procedure to be folllowed\nby wheelchairs users with spinal injury. The system is considered to be of value for virtual health-\ncare in the home, because it is designed for remote access by carers and patients. The system\nTwentieth IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS'07)\n0-7695-2905-4\/07 $20.00  \u00a9 2007\nintegrates diagnostic reasoning and action (i.e treatment), and uses a rule-based reasoning engine\nto identify diagnostic and therapeutic goals appropriate to a particular patients state.\nHowever, since uncertainty is inherent in conventional medical diagnosis, the work presented in\nthis paper was carried out as an attempt to enhance the DIMITRA system by means of employing\nprobabilistic reasoning (hence the name, DIMITRA-Pro) in order to expand the system\u2019s knowl-\nedge base (and incorporate such information such as the patients\u2019 individual medical profiles) and\nprovide a means of quantifying uncertainty associated with diagnoses. The system is essentially\na Bayesian network modelling the causal relationships among variables as elicited from relevant\nliterature concentrating on the caring procedure appropriate for such patients, as well as direct\nquestioning of domain experts via questionnaires.\n2. The DIMITRA-Pro Network Structure\nAn example of the care procedure that needs to be followed by the carers for wheelchair users\nsuffering from spinal injury is presented below [14]: The patient was involved in a road traffic\naccident where she sustained a C6 fracture and C6\/7 dislocation. The fracture was surgically sta-\nbilised and decompressed. The patient also had a tracheotomy, which has now been removed and\nhas undergone a full rehabilitation programme. Her nursing care is currently as follows:\n\u2022 Bladder Management. The patient uses size 16 ArgyII supra pubic catheter with a 10ml\nballoon, which is replaced every 3 weeks. The catheter is attached to a 75ml leg bag during\nthe day and a 2000ml night bag at night. The patient is totally dependent on these procedures.\nThe patient is aware of the signs and symptoms of a bladder infection and is able to instruct\nothers on how to take a urine sample. Also, she is aware of the need to drink 2-3 litres of\nwater per day to help prevent bladder problems.\n\u2022 Bowel Management. The patient has a daily bowel regime; she takes aperients in the\nevening, and she getting up in the morning onto a shower chair and having 2 glycerine sup-\npositories inserted. After the patient has had a result, the rectum is checked with a well\nlubricated gloved finger. This is done to insure the rectum is empty and to prevent bowel\naccidents during the day. The patient requires the assistance of one person for this procedure.\nThe patient is aware of the need to eat a well balanced diet to help prevent bowel problems.\n\u2022 Skin Management. The patient has no problems with her skin at the moment, she sleeps\non a pressure-relieving mattress and is turned every 6 hours during the night. One pillow\nis inserted behind her back and one between her knees and ankles to help prevent pressure.\nWhen the patient is up in her wheelchair she sits on a pressure-relieving cushion. The patient\ndoes pressure relief by leaning forward in the wheelchair. The patient is aware of the need to\ncheck her skin every morning and evening. The patient requires the assistance of one person\nto do this. If a red mark should appear she knows what action to take to prevent further\ndeterioration.\n\u2022 Autonomic Dysreflexia. Due to level of the injury the patient is prone to dysreflexic attacks\nwhich can be a life-threatening problem. The patient has had a dysreflexic attack due to her\nbladder not draining properly.\nThe case description above illustrates that the caring procedure for spinal injury patients is divided\ninto four sections. These sections are bladder management, bowel management, skin management\nand autonomic dysreflexia.\nClearly, the same structure is going to be present in the DIMITRA-Pro system as well. Moreover,\nthe spinal injury patients are divided into categories:\n\u2022 High level patients are those with injured at either the cervical or the upper thoracic regions\nTwentieth IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS'07)\n0-7695-2905-4\/07 $20.00  \u00a9 2007\nof their spinal cord (tetraplegics or quadriplegics).\n\u2022 Low level patients are those with injuries at the other regions (paraplegics).\nConsequently, the diagnosis for the care required in each case is a combination of the level of\nthe injury and the reported symptoms mentioned above (included in the four sections of the care\nprocedure). The diagnostic strategy for tetraplegic (quadriplegic) patients is illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe network structure is based on information derived from DIMITRA\u2019s rule-based system and in-\nformation derived from literature specialising on the caring procedure to be followed on wheelchair\nusers with spinal injury [8].\nThe diagnostic reasoning is based on Bayesian Networks and updates the probabilities of di-\nagnoses when provided with any evidence regarding patients\u2019 signs and symptoms. The model\nregarding the joint probability of disease d and signs\/symptoms s implied by the DIMITRA-Pro\nsystem can be formally written as:\nP (s, d) = P (s|d)P (d) =\n[\u220f\ni\nP (fi)|d\n] [\u220f\nk\nP (dk)\n]\n(1)\nwhere s and d can be modelled using 2 different node types, depending on the natural representation\nof each node which will be sufficient for the description of all node input for the base layer. Those\ntypes are:\n\u2022 Discrete nodes: This type is appropriate for nodes where the answer can be selected from a\nsmall set of discrete choices (like YES\/NO answers). For each possible choice, a confidence\nmeasure is attached to the node.\n\u2022 Continuous nodes: This type suits nodes where continuous domain measurements are to\nbe taken \u2014 such as temperature. For such nodes, a conditional probability distribution is\nattached to the node so that the continuous measurement (in this case, the patient\u2019s temper-\nature) received at the input can be converted into a real number representing a probability\nmeasurement of the symptom. In our example, we would expect that the lower the patient\u2019s\ntemperature is measured, the higher the confidence measure for hypothermia has to be \u2014 but\nalso the lower the temperature confidence will be. However, a normal temperature would\nhave to yield a low confidence measure for both symptoms.\nThe above reasoning was implemented using the commercially available AgenaRisk software\npackage [1].\n3. Model Parameters\nOne difficulty regarding the use of Bayesian Networks for modelling causal relationships in real-\nworld cases is that empirical data for conditional probabilities are often not available [10].\nIn DIMITRA-Pro, conditional probabilities of signs and symptoms given diagnoses were elicited\nfrom 11 experts, all qualified staff nurses from the Stoke Mandeville Hospital, using questionnaires.\nExperts were asked to indicate the assessments for all conditional probabilities pertaining to a single\nvariable given a single conditioning context on the same line. In communicating a conditional\nprobability to our domain, we do not use mathematical notation \u2014 the requested probability is\ntranslated into a fragment of text instead. To support the experts in their assessment task, a verbal-\nnumerical sliding response scale [15] was provived.\nThe desired conditional probabilities of the signs and symptoms given the diagnoses is calculated\nusing the trimean [12]. To model the conditional probabilties of multiple diagnoses on a single find-\ning we use the noisy-OR gate [13]. Even though some studies advocate that subjective probabilities\nmay not be the best for diagnostic purposes [6, 16], other studies suggest that it is possible to add\nthese estimates with empirical data as they become available [9, 10].\nTwentieth IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS'07)\n0-7695-2905-4\/07 $20.00  \u00a9 2007\nFigure 1.

Example results of the DIMITRA-Pro network used as 24-hour consultation tool for\n4 months.\n4. Diagnostic Performance\nIn order to verify the diagnostic value of the DIMITRA-Pro network, two experiments were\ncarried out using real-world cases. The network was tested on a total of 19 cases. In 17 of them\nDIMITRA-Pro delivered correct diagnoses \u2014 a correct diagnosis rate of 89.4%. In the first ex-\nperiment the model was used by a high level patient and carer as a 24-hour consultation tool for a\n4-month period. Illustrative results are presented in Table 1, showing the symptom observation by\nthe patient and carer, the diagnosis by the carer and that provided by the system. In the diagnoses\nthe arrow (\u2192) indicates \u2018leads to\u2019. In the second experiment the model was tested using cases from\ndifferent patients. These results are shown in Table 2. The results are encouraging, although a much\nlarger number of tests cases would need to be evaluated to draw firm conclusions.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this work, a probabilistic model for supporting the caring procedure to be followed for wheelchair\nusers with spinal injury was presented. The proposed model consists of 21 conditions (diagnoses)\nand 49 findings (signs and symptoms). Given a patient\u2019s findings, the model computes the proba-\nbility distribution over the possible conditions associated with the caring procedure. The network\nstructure and numerical parameters were elicited from the rule-based DIMITRA system and was\nbased on the knowledge of the domain experts.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the invaluable help of the qualified nurses from the\nNational Spinal Injury Center, Stoke Mandeville, Aylesbury, UK for providing their estimates of\nthe probabilities of diagnoses given the relevant signs and symtoms for conditions encountered in\nthe field of medical care for patients suffering from spinal injury.\nReferences\n[1] Agena Limited.
