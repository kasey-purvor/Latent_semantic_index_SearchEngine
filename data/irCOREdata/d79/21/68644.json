Introduction\nCoupled oscillators are ubiquitous in nature. They have been studied intensively over\nthe years in many areas of science and technology including e.g. physics (Haken 1983,\nStrogatz 1994), chemistry (Kuramoto 1984) and biology (Winfree 1980). However, most\ntheoretical work on coupled oscillators refers either to a small number of oscillators (e.g.\n2, or at most 3), or to large ensembles that can be treated statistically; only in a few\ncases is the effect of random fluctuations included explicitly.\nIt has long been known that the heart of a healthy human subject in repose does\nnot beat regularly. The rhythmic variation in the heart rate occurring at the frequency\nof respiration, known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia, has been the most studied cardio-\nrespiratory interaction since Hales described changes in blood pressure related to the\nrespiratory pattern in a horse (Hales 1733). Since then there has been much significant\nwork on the cardio-respiratory interaction (e.g. Angelone and Coulter 1964, Davies and\nNielson 1966, Hirsh and Bishop 1981). However, studies of the interactions between the\nother processes involved in the dynamics of the cardiovascular system (CVS) are still\nin their infancy. It has recently been shown (Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 1999, Stefanovska\net al 1999a, 1999b, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 et al 2000, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 et al 2000, Stefanovska et al this\nissue) that, on the time scale of one average circulation period, the cardiovascular system\nbehaves in many ways as a set of 5 coupled, autonomous, nonlinear oscillators of widely\ndiffering frequencies.\nThere are many different approaches to the problem of modelling cardiovascular\ndynamics including e.g. modelling of the blood flow through the system of pipes, or\nmodelling of the coupling mechanisms as a system of differential equations with delay\n(Hyndman et al 1971, Kitney et al 1985, deBoer et al 1987, Baselli et al 1988, Saul et\nal 1991, Starkee and Westerhof 1993, TenVoorde et al 1995, Seidel and Herzel 1995,\nCavalcanti and Belardinelli 1996). The majority of models proposed interpret the\nobserved oscillations in the heart rate and blood pressure in terms of nonlinearities and\ntime delays. They concentrate mainly on short-time blood pressure control mechanisms,\nincluding respiratory oscillations and oscillations with period around 10s. Although\nthese models provide deep insight into particular aspects of the CVS dynamics, their\nrange of application is restricted. In particular, there are many characteristics revealed\nby time series analysis of the blood flow that they do not reproduce.\nThe approach discussed here \u2013 modelling the CVS as a system of coupled oscillators\n\u2013 is qualitatively different. It concentrates on the oscillatory nature of the dynamics on\nthe time-scale of one average circulation period. It aims to develop the simplest possible\nmodel that is able to reflect the oscillatory character of the CVS dynamics and is capable\nof reproducing the main statistical and dynamical characteristics of the measured time\nseries, including the form of the spectra, the variability of the heart rate and respiration,\nas well as of the blood flow and blood pressure, and the main experimentally observed\nfeatures of synchronization phenomena (Hildebrandt 1987, Raschke 1987, Scha\u00a8fer et al\n1998, 1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 and Stefanovska 2000, Mrovka et al 2000, Stefanovska et al\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\n2000).\nIn this paper, we present the results of numerical simulations of the proposed model,\nfocusing on the type of couplings and the effect of noise on the dynamics of the oscillators\u2019\ninteraction. In section 2 we summarise very briefly the experimental observations that\nhave been made to date, and which a satisfactory model may be expected to encompass.\nSection 3 discusses how the model is constructed, and Section 4 reports the results\nobtained from it under different assumptions about the coupling constants and the\npresence or absence of random fluctuations (noise) representing external influences and\nparts of the CVS that are not included explicitly in the model. Section 5 summarises\nthe results and draws conclusions.\n2. Background\nThe proposed model is based on the experimental observation that, on a time scale\nof minutes, there are five almost periodic oscillatory subsystems contributing to the\nregulation of blood flow (Stefanovska and Kros\u02c7elj 1997, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 and Stefanovska, 1998a,\n1998b, Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 1999, Stefanovska et al 1999a, Kvernmo et al 1998, 1999,\nBrac\u02c7ic\u02c7 et al 2000, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 et al 2000). Complex and multiple control mechanisms\nregulate both the frequency and the volume of the blood expelled by the heart in each\ncycle, allowing the organism to respond to the metabolic demand of different parts of\nthe body, to adjust the pressure and the capacity of the CVS, and react to external\nexcitations sensed by the autonomous nervous system. The experimental observations\nthat, taken together as a whole, point unequivocally to the dynamical nature of the\nrhythmic activity of the CVS, can be summarized as follows \u2013\n\u2022 Timescales. Five timescales are involved, and they differ substantially from each\nother (average frequencies of \u223c 1.0, 0.2, 0.1, 0.03 and 0.01 Hz). The physiological\norigin of the different frequency components are obvious in the case of 1 Hz (heart\nbeat), and 0.2 Hz (respiration), reasonably well established in the case of 0.1 Hz\n(intrinsic myogenic activity of smooth muscles), but not yet known with certainty\nin the cases of 0.03 Hz (connected to the autonomous nervous system\u2019s control\nover the cardiovascular system) or 0.01 Hz (apparently associated with endothelial\nactivity). However, they all seems to be characterized by autonomous oscillatory\ndynamics.\n\u2022 Signal and site invariance. All 5 basic frequencies are observed in all measured\nsignals characterizing cardiovascular dynamics, including: heart-rate variability\n(where, however, the heart-rate is by definition missing), blood flow, blood pressure,\nrespiration and ECG.\n\u2022 Time variations. Continuous wavelet analysis of the time series reveals that the\ncharacteristic frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillatory processes are themselves\nof a slowly-varying periodic nature.\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system b\n\u2022 Spectral width. In the amplitude-frequency plane each of the characteristic peaks\naveraged over time is relatively broad, and they seems to be superimposed on a\nbroad (noisy?) spectral background. This suggests that stochastic (or possibly\nchaotic) components also play a role in the regulation of the cardiovascular\ndynamics.\n\u2022 Combination frequencies. In cases where the characteristic or basic frequencies were\nalmost constant (e.g. in the case of a patient in coma), their linear combinations\nwere clearly demonstrated.\n\u2022 Synchronization. Recent analysis of cardiorespiratory synchrograms (Scha\u00a8fer et al\n1998, 1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 and Stefanovska 2000, Mrovka et al 2000, Stefanovska\net al 2000) show that cardiac and respiratory oscillators can become synchronized\nin different n:m synchronization regimes. Furthermore, it is now established that\nsynchronisation phenomena can also arise between some of the other oscillators\n(Stefanovska and Hoz\u02c7ic\u02c7 2000).\n\u2022 Zero Lyapunov exponent. In the blood flow of healthy subjects, one of the Lypunov\nexponents is always found to be equal to zero within experimental and numerical\nerror. A zero value of one of the Lyapunov exponents suggests (Abarbanel et al,\n1993) that the source is governed by differential equations, or by a finite time map.\nBased on this inference, we may take the zero exponent in the blood flow of healthy\nresting humans as implying the dominantly deterministic nature of the CVS signals.\nWe consider separately evidence derived, first, from the analysis of oscillations in\nheart rate variability (HRV), respiration, blood flow and blood pressure and, secondly,\nfrom the phenomenon of synchronization. The reason is that, as we shall see\nlater, they provide complementary information required to determine the strength\nand type of coupling. Furthermore, the analysis of HRV is of well known clinical\nsignificance (Task Force of the ESC and the NASPE 1996), while initial investigations\nof synchronization between the heart rate and respiration are already demonstrating its\npotential importance in clinical measurements.\nWe emphasize that, if the idea of characterizing CVS dynamics in terms of a system\nof coupled oscillators is correct, then one of the general approaches to the analysis of\nsuch a system can indeed be based on an analysis of its synchronization (Rosenblum et\nal 2000, Pikovsky et al 2001). We mention here only a few experimental results \u2013\n\u2022 Cardiorespiratory synchronization in healthy subjects. Only short episodes of\nsynchronization with a high locking ratio and high variability of the heart and\nrespiration frequencies were observed in healthy subjects at rest. Their heart beat\nis around 1 Hz and the extent of its variability is age-dependent (Kaplan et al 1991,\nJansen-Urstad et al 1997, Stein et al 1997, Yeragani et al 1997, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 and\nStefanovska 2000).\n\u2022 A subject in coma. In a sedated subject in a critical state of coma, a very high\nheart frequency (1.6 Hz), with no variability and no synchronization, were observed\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\n(Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 1999). Deprived of feedback control from the peripheral\nsystems, the cardiac frequency resumes its autonomous value, similar to its state\nwhen the heart is taken out of the body.\n\u2022 Cardiorespiratory synchronization in athletes. Athletes are characterized by a\nrelatively low average heart frequency, high heart rate variability, and longer\nepisodes of synchronization with lower locking ratios (Kvernmo et al 1998, Scha\u00a8fer\net al 1998, 1999).\n\u2022 Type II diabetic subjects. Patients with type II diabetes mellitus demonstrate a\nhigh average heart rate, low heart rate variability (Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 et al 2000) and\nvery long episodes of synchronization (Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 et al unpublished results).\n\u2022 An\u00e6sthesia. It has recently been shown that during an\u00e6sthesia in rats\u00b6 the\ncardiorespiratory system passes reversibly through a sequence of different phase-\nsynchronized states as the an\u00e6sthesia level changes (Stefanovska et al 2000). The\nsynchronisation state seems to provide a direct and objective measure of the depth\nof an\u00e6sthesia.\n\u2022 Heart rate synchronized by a weak external forcing. Cardiorespiratory synchroniza-\ntion during paced respiration (Seidel and Herzel 1998) and synchronization of the\nheart with external periodic sounds or light signals (Anishchenko et al 2000) were\nalso demonstrated.\nAll these observations demonstrate clearly that different states of the organism may\ncorrespond to different regimes of synchronization which, as already mentioned above,\ncan be of clinical significance and strongly support the idea of modelling the CVS\ndynamics as a system of coupled oscillators.\nThis list of experimental evidence is far from complete. We mention just one\nmore important observation. It was found that there is a statistically significant trend\nin the dependence of the time-averaged synchronization index (defined in Tass et al\n1998, Rosenblum et al 2000) and the standard deviation of the HRV distribution\n(Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 and Stefanovska 2000). Control of the cardiovascular system thus seems\nto be maintained by a fine balance between variations of the eigenfrequencies of the\noscillators, resulting in mutual amplitude and frequency modulation and, sometimes,\nmutual synchronization between the phases of the oscillators.\nMoreover, an inverse relationship between the average cardiac frequency and the\nextent of its variation seems to exist. In resting subjects, the higher the cardiac frequency\nis, the lower is its variability (Tsuji et al 1996). Athletes lie at one extreme, with a low\ncardiac frequency (below 1 Hz) and high heart rate variability, whereas a heart taken\nout of the body, or disconnected from the rest of the body by an\u00e6sthesia or sedatives,\nlies at the other extreme and is characterised by a high frequency (around 1.6 Hz)\nand no variability. Synchronization seems to be involved in this interplay between the\nbasic, average frequency and the extent of its variation: the more strongly the cardiac\n\u00b6 The dynamics of the CVS in rats has been shown to posses similar features to those in humans,\ndespite the cardiac and respiratory rhythms in rats being approximately 4 times faster than in humans.\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system     \noscillations are synchronized to the respiratory oscillations, the less variable and the \nhigher the cardiac frequency seems to be.\n3. The model\nThe model synthesis was based upon the experimental observation (see above) that there\nare five main frequency components in all the physiological time series: blood pressure,\nblood flow, ECG and respiration. Accordingly, a system of five coupled oscillators to\nmodel the CVS dynamics was chosen. The set of equations used for the modelling\nwas suggested in earlier publications of one of the authors (Stefanovska et al 1999,\nStefanovska et al this issue). The physiological interpretation of oscillators, discussed\nabove, is as follows \u2013\nFrequency (Hz) Physiological function\n1 Heart\n0.2 Respiration\n0.1 Myogenic activity\n0.03 Neurogenic activity\n0.01 Endothelial related metabolic activity\nThe basic unit in the model, corresponding to the autonomous part of an oscillator, is\nthe Poincare\u00b4 oscillator\nx\u02d9i = \u2212xiqi \u2212 \u03c9iyi + gxi(x),\ny\u02d9i = \u2212yiqi + \u03c9ixi + gyi(y), qi = \u03b1i(\n\u221a\nx2i + y\n2\ni \u2212 ai),\n(1)\nwhere x, y are vectors of oscillator state variables, \u03b1i, ai, and \u03c9i are constants and gyi(y)\nand gxi(x) are linear coupling vectors. Although to some extent this choice is arbitrary,\nit is an oscillator that possesses the properties of structural stability, robustness and\nsymmetry that are consistent with physiological understanding, and with the analyses\nof measured time series.\nThe activity of each subsystem is described by two state variables, the blood flow xi,\nand the velocity of flow yi, where i = 1 is generated by the heart, i = 2 by respiration,\ni = 3 by the myogenic oscillator, i = 4 by the neurogenic oscillator, and i = 5 by\nthe metabolic oscillator. The mutual impact of the subsystems is taken into account\nas coupling terms. Additional effects resulting from the spatial distribution of some\nof the systems, such as the myogenic, neurogenic and endothelial related metabolic\nactivity, and the effect of additional subsystems, acting on longer time scales than those\nconsidered, are taken into account as random noise.\nThe most nontrivial part of the model synthesis is the treatment of the couplings\nbetween oscillators. The type of couplings is currently unknown for most of the\nrelationships between the subsystems. In the model, therefore, linear couplings are\nintroduced. This type of coupling can be further justified by the observation of the\nsame basic frequency components in all the physiological signals characterizing the CVS\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\ndynamics, and by the fact that only very small amplitude combinatorial components\nare observed in these signals.\nIt is well-known that time delays are very important in the description of\nphysiological systems and are often used in modelling various parts of the cardiovascular\nsystem (Hyndman et al 1971, Kitney et al 1985, deBoer et al 1987, Baselli et al 1988,\nSaul et al 1991, Starkee and Westerhof 1993, TenVoorde et al 1995, Seidel and Herzel\n1995, Cavalcanti and Belardinelli 1996). In our approach we understand the blood\ndistribution system as one in which continuous information about every subsystem,\nacting with essentially different frequencies, is provided and fed back via coupling terms.\nThere are thus delays corresponding to the time scale on which the particular subsystem\nacts. A number of delays therefore exist in the system and at this stage, again for the\nsake of simplicity of the proposed model, we effectively introduce them via additive\ncoupling terms, corresponding to the time scales of the coupled subsystems. In this way\nnot only few, but multiple delays are introduced into the system.\nIn some cases the sign of the coupling term can be determined from existing\nphysiological knowledge and experimental observations. Direct modulation of the heart\nfrequency by the respiration, and clear evidence of the corresponding combinational\nfrequencies in the Fourier spectra for the subject in coma, suggest that unidirectional\nparametric coupling, i.e. cardiac frequency modified by respiration, but not vice versa,\nhas to be included in the model. Moreover, the experimental evidences also suggest that\nmost of the couplings are not symmetrical. Additional difficulties in the model synthesis\nare related to the fact that the myogenic, neurogenic and metabolic activities cannot be\nmeasured directly in physiological experiments using noninvasive techniques.\nIn what follows we will first introduce the model with linear coupling terms and\ndiscuss briefly their physiological relevance. We then consider the case of unidirectional\nparametric coupling and allow the cardiac frequency to be modulated by the rest of the\nsystem.\nThe function of the heart can be presented as\nx\u02d91 = \u2212 x1q1 \u2212 y1\u03c91 + \u03b72x2 \u2212 \u03b73x3 \u2212 \u03b74x4 + \u03b75x5 \u2212 \u03b76(\u03a61 \u2212 \u03a62)\ny\u02d91 = \u2212 y1q1 + x1\u03c91 + \u03b72y2 \u2212 \u03b73y3 \u2212 \u03b74y4 + \u03b75y5 , (2)\nwhere \u03b7i are coupling terms. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (see Section 1) refers to\nfrequency modulation of the heart rate: the heart beats faster during inspiration and\nslower during expiration. Comparable modulation phenomena can also be observed in\neach part of the circulatory system: the amplitude of the flow component resulting\nfrom the heart beat in the peripheral blood flow is modulated by the frequency of\nrespiration. It was shown that the coupling between the heart and respiration enables\nboth modulation and synchronisation to occur. At the moment just a single term (\u03b72)\nis used in the model for the cardio-respiratory coupling, although it is evident that in\nreality several mechanisms are involved.\nNegative influences of the myogenic (\u2212\u03b73) and neurogenic system on the heart (\u2212\u03b74)\nare considered. The autonomous nervous system processes the information sensed by\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\nreceptors and continuously adjusts the heart rate. The heart is innervated by both\ndivisions of the autonomous nervous system \u2013 the sympathetic increases, and the\nparasympathetic decreases, the frequency and amplitude of myocardial contractions.\nParasympathetic tone predominates in healthy resting humans. Increased metabolic\nactivity results in an increased heart rate: a positive control loop is therefore assigned\nto the metabolic system (\u03b75).\nThe difference between the inflow (\u03a61) on the arterial side and the outflow (\u03a62) to\nthe venous side also contributes to the flow of blood generated by the heart. The\ndynamics of each of the other oscillators and their couplings at any point of the\ncardiovascular system can be described in a similar way (see Stefanovska et al this\nissue).\nHowever, the cardiac contribution to the flow at each point results not only from the\ninfluences of local regulatory mechanisms, but also from the integration of the pressure\n(P ) and flow (\u03a6) values along the entire system. A global effect of the pressure on the\nmyogenic and the neurogenic activity, and of the flow on metabolic activity, is also to\nbe expected. Therefore, in (Stefanovska et al 1999b, Stefanovska et al this issue) the\nmodel was extended to describe the activity of the oscillators that regulate the flow of\nblood along the cardiovascular system\nx\u02d91 = \u2212 x1q1 \u2212 y1\u03c91 + \u03b72x2 \u2212 \u03b73x3 \u2212 \u03b74x4 + \u03b75x5 +\n+ \u03b76\n\u222b l\n0\nP (z, t)dz + \u03b77\n\u222b l\n0\n\u03a6(z, t)dz\ny\u02d91 = \u2212 y1q1 + x1\u03c91 + \u03b72y2 \u2212 \u03b73y3 \u2212 \u03b74y4 + \u03b75y5 , (3)\nx\u02d92 = \u2212 x2q2 \u2212 y2\u03c92 + \u03b84x4 + \u03b85x5 +\n+ \u03b86\n\u222b l\n0\nP (z, t)dz + \u03b87\n\u222b l\n0\n\u03a6(z, t)dz\ny\u02d92 = \u2212 y2q2 + x2\u03c92 + \u03b84y4 + \u03b85y5 , (4)\nx\u02d93 = \u2212 x3q3 \u2212 y3\u03c93 + \u03b34x4 \u2212 \u03b35x5 \u2212 \u03b36 P\ny\u02d93 = \u2212 y3q3 + x3\u03c93 + \u03b34y4 \u2212 \u03b35y5 , (5)\nx\u02d94 = \u2212 x4q4 \u2212 y4\u03c94 \u2212 \u03c12x2 + \u03c13x3 \u2212 \u03c15x5 \u2212 \u03c16 P\ny\u02d94 = \u2212 y4q4 + x4\u03c94 \u2212 \u03c12y2 + \u03c13y3 \u2212 \u03c15y5 , (6)\nand\nx\u02d95 = \u2212 x5q5 \u2212 y5\u03c95 + \u03c32x2 \u2212 \u03c33x3 \u2212 \u03c34x4 + \u03c36 \u03a6\ny\u02d95 = \u2212 y5q5 + x5\u03c95 + \u03c32y2 \u2212 \u03c33y3 \u2212 \u03c34y4 .

Preliminary results of numerical simulations\nIn the preliminary stage of modelling, presented in this paper, the main aim was\nto obtain some initial insight into the numerical characteristics of the model and, in\nparticular \u2014\n\u2022 to examine the basic principles used in the model synthesis;\n\u2022 to verify the ability of this model to reproduce the main features observed in the\ntime series analysis and in the analysis of synchronization;\n\u2022 to check how sensitive the model is to changes in the oscillator parameters and in\nthe coupling vectors, and\n\u2022 to determine the extent to which the strength and direction of coupling can be\nidentified by comparison of the measured and model time series.\nWe have carried out a digital simulation of the model, using a high-speed pseudo-random\ngenerator (Marsaglia and Tsang 1984) for the increment \u2206x1. Time series for each of the\noscillators were generated by a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. For each set of parameters\n82 min records were generated. To simplify manipulations with the multi-dimensional\ncoupling vector we have built a MatLab based graphical user interface providing for real\ntime control of all the parameters of the system.\nThe flow component of each of the oscillators can be presented graphically after\neach run for a selected set of parameters. Here, we focus on the cardiac and respiratory\ncomponents. Since the time series of the cardiac flow is, to a great extent, comparable\nto heart rate variability, we also focus on its spectral content. At this stage, however, as\nwe shall see below, the simplified model is only capable of reproducing time variability of\nthe heart rate to a limited extent. A windowed Fourier transform is used for calculation\nof the spectra. A time window of 246 s was used for estimation of the power spectrum,\nand the calculation was repeated for 20 windows, with no overlaps between them. The\npower spectrum presented here is thus a time average over the spectra obtained within\n20 windows. In reality, all measured signals contain time variable frequency content and\nfor estimation of their spectral components we need time-frequency methods, i.e. the\nwavelet transform.\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\nTime variability was taken into account in synchronization analysis between the\ncardiac and respiratory oscillators. The synchronization or mutual adjustment of the\ncardiac and respiratory rhythms was analysed using the recently proposed method\nfor the detection of synchronization between irregular and non-stationary oscillators\n(Pikovsky et al 2001). The relative phase of the heartbeats within one respiratory\ncycles \u03a81, was calculated for each set of parameters using the marker events method.\nThe occurrence of synchronization was examined in a synchrogram, constructed by\nplotting the normalised relative phase of the cardiac component within 1 respiratory\ncycle, \u03a81 =\n1\n2pi\n(\u03a6r(tk)mod2pi), where tk is the time of kth heartbeat and \u03a6r is the\ninstantaneous phase of respiration. Horizontal plateaus in the synchrogram are then\ninterpreted as representing a constant phase difference, and thus the occurrence of phase\nsynchronization.\n4.1. Linear couplings\nThe set of equations (3)-(7) described in the previous section includes coupling with\nthe multiple degrees of freedom of the CVS accumulated in the blood pressure and\nblood flow. However, here we start with a simplified version of the model, taking into\naccount the description of the flow at a point in the cardiovascular system, of the form\n(2) introduced above for the cardiac oscillator. Hence, in the first stage, no effect of\nmultiple degrees of freedom was taken into account. Our preliminary analysis of the\nmodel shows that it is possible to identify at least one set of parameters that enables\nthe characteristic features of the time series and power spectra to be reproduced. We\nemphasize that whether or not this parameter set is unique remains for the present\nan open question. However, our initial results have already suggested some further\nexperiments to try to clarify the matter. For the present studies, the model parameters\nwere set as follows \u2013\n\u03b11 = 1.0, a1 = 0.5, f1 = 1.1 Hz, \u03b72 = \u2212\u03b73 = \u2212\u03b74 = \u03b75 = 0.5,\n\u03b12 = 1.0, a2 = 1.0, f2 = 0.36 Hz, \u03b84 = \u03b85 = 0.1,\n\u03b13 = 1.0, a3 = 1.0, f3 = 0.1 Hz, \u03b34 = \u03b35 = 0.1,\n\u03b14 = 1.0, a4 = 1.0, f4 = 0.04 Hz, \u03c12 = \u03c13 = \u03c15 = 0.1, and\n\u03b15 = 1.0, a5 = 0.5, f5 = 0.01 Hz, \u03c32 = \u03c33 = \u03c34 = 0.1.\nIn Figure 1 results corresponding to the presence of linear coupling terms only\nare shown. It can be seen that the power spectrum of the oscillations in the blood\nflow, generated by the heart, reproduce the main characteristic features observed\nexperimentally in the peripheral blood flow signal measured by a laser Doppler\ntechnique, including the position and relative intensities of the peaks. However, the\nwidths of the peaks, and correspondingly the variability of the heart and respiration\nrates, are much smaller then those observed experimentally. In particular, no epochs of\nsynchronization are observed in the cardio-respiratory synchrograms.\nHere we note that the variation of the coupling parameters and\/or natural\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\n0 50 100 150 200\n\u22121\n0\n1\nx1\ntime, s\n(a)\n0 50 100 150 200\n\u22122\n0\n2\nx2\ntime, s\n(b)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n10\u22125\n100\nS(f)\nf, Hz\n(d)\n0 50 100 150 200\n0\n2\n4\n6\nph\nas\ne \nm\nod\n 2\npi\ntime, s\n(c)\nFigure 1.

However, motivated\nby the experimental observation of short episodes of synchronization (Sha\u00a8ffer et al 1998,\n1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7 and Stefanovska 2000), we will concentrate on the non-synchronized\nstate. We are interested in establishing whether or not it is possible to reproduce in\nnumerical simulations the regime where short epochs of synchronization occur.\n4.2. Linear couplings in the presence of fluctuations\nIn the next step, couplings with multiple degrees of freedom accumulated in the\nblood pressure and blood flow were added in an attempt to introduce the globally\ndistributed effects of the CVS. However, at this stage equations (3)-(7) were not modelled\nnumerically to their full extent and \u03b76 = \u03b77 = \u03b86 = \u03b87 = \u03b36 = \u03c16 = \u03c36 = 0. Rather, a\nfluctuational term was added to the cardiac oscillations (2)\nx\u02d91 = \u2212x1q1 \u2212 2pif1y1 + gx1(x) + \u03be(t),\n< \u03be(t) >= 0, < \u03be(t)\u03be(0) >= D\u03b4(t),\n(9)\nThus, all influences of the rest of the system are lumped in the fluctuational term\n\u03be(t). The addition of the random term, very interestingly, resulted in epochs of\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\n0 50 100 150 200\n\u22121\n0\n1\nx1\ntime, s\n(a)\n0 50 100 150 200\n\u22122\n0\n2\nx2\ntime, s\n(b)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n10\u22125\n100\nS(f)\nf, Hz\n(d)\n0 50 100 150 200\n0\n2\n4\n6\nph\nas\ne \nm\nod\n 2\npi\ntime, s\n(c)\nFigure 2.

Without noise, only the\nstandard regimes of phase-locking, phase modulation, and their interplay, could be\nobserved. However, the heart rate variability remains very small suggesting that\nprobably parametric coupling also plays an important role in the cardiac activity and\nthe activity of other cardiovascular oscillators.\n4.3. Parametric couplings\nJust for comparison we show in Figure 3 results corresponding to purely parametric\ndeterministic coupling of the heart rhythmic activity to the rest of the system in the\nform\nx\u02d91 = \u2212 x1q1 \u2212 y1(\u03c91 + \u03b72x2 \u2212 \u03b73x3 \u2212 \u03b74x4 + \u03b75x5)\ny\u02d91 = \u2212 y1q1 + x1(\u03c91 + \u03b72y2 \u2212 \u03b73y3 \u2212 \u03b74y4 + \u03b75y5) , (10)\nIt can clearly be seen that although the heart rate variability can be increased\ndramatically the power spectra and the cardio-respiratory synchrogram still differ\nsubstantially from those observed experimentally.\nSynchronisation of a noisy van der Pol oscillator with modulated natural frequency\nhas already been analysed in the context of the cardiorespiratory interaction (Sha\u00a8ffer at\nal 1999).

Moreover, the presence of noise smeared this locking effect, while\nquasiperiodic modulation, as also considered in our case, resulted in frequency locking\nwithout phase locking.\nModulation and synchronisation may or may not coexist in parametrically coupled\nsystems in presence of noise. This was also observed for the cardiorespiratory interaction,\nwhere generally the intensity of synchronisation appears to be inversely proportional to\nthe modulation of cardiac frequency by the respiratory related rhythm (Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 Lotric\u02c7\nand Stefanovska, 2000). However this relation is changed in subjects with cardiovascular\ndisease suggesting that this two mechanisms are essential for the functioning of the\ncardiovascular system. However, whether the parametric coupling enables this interplay\nto occur remains to be clarified.\n5. Summary and conclusions\nThe preliminary analysis of the model, presented above, has been restricted to the\ncardio-respiratory interaction on account of two main reasons. On one hand, there\nis a number of experimental results related to this type of interaction including e.g.\ninvestigation of the respiratory-sinus arrhythmia and cardio-respiratory synchronization.\nOn the other hand, it is only these two high frequency signals of the model that can be\nrelated directly to the experimentally observable variables. However, even at this early\nstage of the investigations, some important conclusions can be reached about the type\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\nof coupling and the role of fluctuations.\nThe results obtained suggest that the type and strength of the linear coupling in\nour model can be determined quite accurately through comparison of the observed and\nsimulated time series. Comparison of the experimental data with time series obtained\nfrom the model suggests, in particular, that in order to reproduce the main dynamical\nfeatures of the cardiac rhythmic activity both linear and parametric couplings have to\nbe taken into account, with linear coupling playing the dominant role. This comparison\nalso shows that the fluctuations play an important role in the CVS dynamics. In\nparticular, fluctuations are responsible (at least in part) for the experimentally observed\nand numerically reproduced broadening of the main spectral peaks and for a number of\nregimes of synchronization.\nHere we note that the model is capable of reproducing the different patterns of\nsynchrogrammes observed experimentally including e.g. the standard phase locking\nregime and the regime of continuously varying phase both in the presence and in the\nabsence of noise. We were specifically interested to establish whether it is possible\nto reproduce in numerical simulations the regime of short epochs of synchronisation\nobserved in the experiment (see Fig. 4 in Stefanovska et al this issue). It turns out that\nsuch regime can be reproduced numerically only in the presence of fluctuations. To do\nso one can tune e.g. cardiac and respiration frequencies close to, but slightly outside,\nthe regime of phase locking. By adding fluctuations to the cardiac oscillator it is then\npossible to induce short epochs of synchronization as shown in the Fig. 2.\nA qualitative explanation of this phenomenon within the framework of the current\nmodel may be as follows. In a first approximation, the interaction between the heart and\nrespiratory oscillations is due to a unidirectional influence of the respiratory oscillator\non the heart rhythm. The effect of the coupling to the rest of the system can be taken\ninto account by allowing for the fluctuations. This simplified situation can be modelled\nas a singled out nonlinear oscillator driven by periodic and random forces. The model\ncan be further simplified. By introducing a slowly varying phase difference between\nthe phase of oscillator and the phase of the driving force \u03c6(t) = \u03a6(t) \u2212 \u03a8(t), and by\nassuming a constant amplitude approximation (Stratanovich 1963), we have\n\u03c6\u02d9 = \u2206+K sin(\u03c6) + \u03c8(t), (11)\nwhere \u2206 is the detuning n\u03c91 \u2212 m\u03c92, K is a function of the system parameters, \u03c6 is\nthe slowly varying phase of the cardiac oscillations and \u03c8 is a new random zero-mean\nGaussian variable.\nIt can be seen from (11) that small values of \u2206 correspond to a small slope of the\nwash-board potential corresponding to (11) and to the locking of the phase \u03c6 at the\nbottom of one of the potential wells. On the other hand relatively large values of \u2206\ncorrespond to a large slope of the wash-board potential, to the disappearance of the\nlocal potential well and to the absence of synchronization. In the presence of weak noise\ntwo effects can be expected. For a small value of \u2206, noise can induce transitions of the\nphase between different potential wells. In this regime the system will stay mainly in a\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\nstate of synchronization but, from time-to-time, phase steps \u221d 2pi will occur. Another\npossible regime for relatively large (but not too large) values of \u2206 is that the system\nmay stay mainly in the desynchronized state modulated by noise. If however large rare\nfluctuations effectively decrease the value of \u2206, short epochs of synchronization will\nbe observed. This hypothesis can in principle be verified using methods for the direct\nanalysis of the fluctuational dynamics (Luchinsky et al 1998), as will be discussed in a\nfuture publication.\nWe conclude that our preliminary results support the model of five coupled\noscillators suggested and justified in earlier physiological experiments (Stefanovska and\nKros\u02c7elj 1997, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 and Stefanovska, 1998a, 1998b, Stefanovska and Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 1999a,\nStefanovska et al 1999a, 1999b, Kvernmo et al 1998, 1999, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7 et al 2000, Brac\u02c7ic\u02c7\nLotric\u02c7 et al 2000). In particular, the model is able to reproduce some basic features\nof the cardio-respiratory interactions observed in physiological time series including e.g.\nheart rate variability, synchronization phenomena and the general shape of the power\nspectra.\nMoreover, the preliminary analyses suggest that the information obtained from\nthese time series is complementary to that from the physiological measurements, in\nthat it will allow one to determine at least approximately the type and strength of\ncoupling.\nOne of the important conclusions is that the interplay between the synchronization\nand frequency modulation can be taken into account by adding noise to the system.\nThe latter corresponds to the fact that, in the simplified version of the model, the\ncardiac and respiratory rhythmic activities are coupled only to the local low frequency\noscillations taken at some arbitrary point of the cardiovascular system. However, in\nreality there is an ensemble of infinitely many such local low frequency oscillators\ncharacterized by the distribution over oscillator\u2019s frequencies, amplitudes and phases.\nThis could be taken into account e.g. by introducing ensemble-averaged values of the low\nfrequency components x\u00af3, x\u00af4, x\u00af5, y\u00af3, y\u00af4, y\u00af5 into the equations of motion for the cardiac\nand respiratory oscillations and by allowing for fluctuations of these values within the\nrange determined by their standard deviations from the averaged values found from the\ntimes series analyses.\nThe cardiovascular system, as probably all living systems, is characterised by the\npresence of large numbers of degrees of freedom and, remarkably, the ability to effect a\nnatural grouping of the degrees of freedom and time scales. It appears that the phase\nlocking of coupled oscillators provides a means to bind degrees of freedom.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research of A Stefanovska was supported by the Royal Society of London and the\nSlovenian Ministry of Science and Technology; and that of D G Luchinsky and P V E\nMcClintock by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK).\nModelling couplings among the oscillators of the cardiovascular system\nReferences\nAbarbanel H D I, Brown R, Sidorowich J J, Tsimring L Sh 1993 The analysis of observed chaotic data\nin physical systems Rev.
