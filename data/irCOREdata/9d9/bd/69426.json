The stability of a section of the tube in presence of the \nreflected signals is determined by making a number of passes through the section for ii very low drive power. A section \nis considxed statle if the output power converges after 4 passes. If the outpiit power goes on increasing or dues not \nconverge then the section is defined as unstable. Results are presented for a 60 W helix TWT which is designed both in \ntwo-section and in three-section for small-Signal gain more than 60dB. It is shown that the two-section TWT can be \nmade stable with 10 dl3 return loss at the input and output terminations, only if the tip loss profile at the sever can be \ndesigned to have a return loss of more than 30dB. For the three-section tube. the retum loss at the sever does riot need \nto be greater than 20dB for stable output performance. \n1. Introduction \nA helix TWT is a medium power microwave \namplifier whose gain can be 60 dB or more. \nFor such a high gain TWT, stability against \nreflected signals caused by mismatches at the \ninput and output terminations is an important \ndesign aspect. It is known [ 13 that, for stability \nagainst the reflected signal, the small-signal \ngain of a one-section tube (Gss) should be less \nthan the sum of the return loss at the input (RjJ \nand output (%ut) terminations and the circuit \nloss of the section. Thus, \nThe return loss at the input and output \nterminations for a working helix TWT (with \nbeam ON) can be as high as 10dB. Therefore, \nthe gain of a one-section helix TWT having \ncircuit loss around 6dB should not be more \nthan 26dB for stable performance. It is, \ntherefore, necessary to design the helix slow- \nwave circuit of a TWT having stable gain more \nthan 60dB either in two or three sections \nseparated by severs (Figs. 1 and 2). The \nposition of a sever is also an important design \naspect and it should be optimized for maximum \navailable saturated efficiency of the tube [2]. \nThis can be achieved when the small-signal \ngain of the output section is not less than 27dB. \nBecause of the requirement of high gain in the \noutput section for maximum available saturated \nefficiency, its stability against the reflected \nsignals caused by mismatches at the \nterminations was studied using a helix large- \nsignal model [3-51. \n2. Approach of using large-signal model \nThe effect of the reflected voltage component \non the electron beam is determined by iterating \nthe simulation of the interaction between the \nelectron beam and the RF wave on the helix \nthrough the section of a tube. The large-signal \nmodel [3-51 simulates the multi-signal effects \nand includes the induced backward voltage \ncomponents and the effect of the reflected \nvoltages caused by mismatches at each end of a \nsection. The measured values of the reflection \nat the input and output couplers are used but \nthe reflection is set to 100% at sever because \nthe helix is shorted to the body at this position. \nReflected voltage component for the nth signal \nat the output plane (k=kz) of a section moving \nin the backward direction is defined as follows: \n80 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\n(i) at sever end of the input section: \nWK,, = cvF,,H)* (2) \n(ii) at coupler end of the output section: \n-%,U = %,out (VFn,u)* (3) \nwhere, is the voltage reflection \ncoefficient for the n* signal at the output \ncoupler and (VFn,u)* is the complex conjugate \nof the forward voltage component of the nth \nsignal at the last plane kz of a section. \nSimilarly, the effect of a mismatch at the input \nend of a section is introduced. The reflected \nvoltage component (VFRn,kl) at the input end \n(k=kl) moving in the forward direction is given \nas follows: \n(i) at sever end of the output section: \nVF&,kl = v n , k l ) *  (4) \n(ii) at coupler end of the input section: \nvFRn,kl = &,in wBn,kl)* (5) \nwhere, &,in is the voltage reflection coefficient \nof the nth signal at the input coupler end and \n(VBn,kl)* is the complex conjugate of the \nbackward voltage component of the n* signal \nat the first plane (k=kl) of a section. \nBy including the effect of the reflected voltages \nin the above manner, it is possible to simulate \nthe effect of the tip loss profiles at severs [6]. \nThe reflected signal at the tip of the sever loss \nis determined by modeling the tube with large \ndrive power and using very low beam current \nso that the gain is effectively zero. The ratio of \nthe reflected power to the incident power at the \ntip of the sever loss determines the return loss \nat the sever. The stability of a section against \nreflections caused by mismatches at the \nterminations and against the backward voltage \ncomponents can then be studied by making a \nnumber of passes through the section with \nnormal beam current and very low drive power \n[6]. A section is considered stable if the output \npower converges after 4 passes. If the output \npow& goes on increasing or does not converge \nthen the section is defined as unstable. In \npractice it is desirable to achieve greater return \nloss than the minimum required for stability to \nreduce the amplitude of the gain ripple [7]. \n3. Analysis of a high gain helix TWT \nThe results for a 60W output power, 60dB gain \nhelix TWT operating at a beam voltage of \n3.0kV and beam current 75mA, are presented. \nThis tube was designed in both two-section and \nthree-section versions for maximum avail ible \nsaturated electronic efficiency with helix pitch \nand loss profiles as shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2, \nrespectively. The return loss at the input and at \nthe output terminations was taken to be 1OdB. \nLength, shape and total loss of the sever loss \nare selected for achieving return loss much \nbetter than 30dB at the tip of the sever loss. \nThe length and loss of the tip loss profiles for \nthe three-section TWT are reduced for \nachieving the comparable performances. Table- \nI and Table-I1 given on the next page show \nrespectively the computed performances ai \nsaturation of the two-section TWT and the \nthree-section TWT over the frequency band of \n3.60 to 4.20 GHz. These results were computed \nincluding the effect of the reflected signals. \nFig.3 compares the power profiles of the 2- \nsection and the 3-section TWT. In the 2-section \nTWT the output section is longer and it has \nsmall-signal gain of 33.50dB. It is found, in \nthis case, that the output section is stable with a \nreturn loss at the output port of lOdB when the \nreturn loss at the sever is greater than 30dB. \nTherefore, the loss profile of the tip loss is very \ncritical to the stability of a two-section tube of \ngain 60 dB. In the three-section TWT, the \noutput section has small-signal gain of 26.5dB. \nIt was found that the output section is stable, \nwith the return loss at the output port of lOdB, \nwhen the return loss at the sever is greater than \n20dB. Thus the profile of the tip loss is less \ncritical in this case. The stability of the output \nsection of the 2-section TWT can be improved \nagainst the higher reflections at the \n\u2019 tenninations by reducing its length but this \nreduces the saturated efficiency. For example, \nif the length of the output section is reduced by \n81 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 19, 2008 at 06:44 from IEEE Xplore.

Conclusion \nA large-signal model has been used to study \nthe stability of a high gain helix TWT against \nthe reflected signals caused by mismatches at \nthe terminations. The tube studied was a 60 W \nhelix TWT designed for more than 60dB gain \nboth in 2-section and in 3-section versions. It \nwas concluded that the tube can be made in \ntwo sections with return loss at the input and \noutput terminations of 10 dB, only if the tip \nloss profile at the sever can be designed to \nachieve a return loss greater than 30dB. For the \nthree-section tube, the output section is stable, \nwith return loss lOdB at the output, if the return \nloss at the sever is greater thaii 20dB. This \nmakes it easier to achieve stability at the price \nof some loss in efficiency. \n~~ \nFrequency Power Gain Phase Shift \u2019 Efficiency Harmonics \n3.6 48.76 53.19 23.82 33.41 31.61 \n3.9 48.92 56.37 40.02 34.66 21.69 \n4.2 48.55 58.55 55.56 3 1.85 26.57 \n(GHz) ( a m )  (dB) peg.)
