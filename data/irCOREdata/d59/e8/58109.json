It currently holds over \n14,000 records of landslide events.  By combining BGS\u2019s corporate datasets with expert knowledge, \nBGS has developed a landslide hazard assessment tool, GeoSure, which provides information on \nthe relative landslide hazard susceptibility at national scale. \n \nKey words: landslide, National Landslide Database, GeoSure, hazard, LiDAR, geophysics \n1.  Introduction \nIn the global context, Great Britain does not experience extreme climatic or tectonic events, nor \nhave the mountainous regions associated with large scale, destructive landslides seen elsewhere in \nthe world.  Despite this, landslides are common in Britain and several major landslides have \noccurred within living memory.  Examples of these have caused structural damage to property \n(Holbeck Hall, Scarborough; Lee, 1999), interrupted transportation routes (Glen Ogle, Scotland; \nWinter et al., 2006) and resulted in fatalities (Whitehaven, Cumbria; Jenkins and Hobbs, 2007).  \nThe British Geological Survey (BGS) is the national geological agency for Great Britain that \nprovides geoscientific information to government, other institutions and the public.  This paper \ngives an overview of the research BGS is currently undertaking into landslides on both national \nand site-specific scales with emphasis on new technologies. \n2.  National-scale landslide assessments of Great Britain \nTo reduce the risks associated with unstable ground to the public, the identification of both known \nfailures and possible future landslides is vital.  With rising population, pressures on land and \nclimate change the identification of landslides, and the potential for them, is of particular \nsignificance. \n2.1  The BGS National Landslide Database \nPrior to a national assessment of landslides being undertaken, the subdued topography and \ndegraded nature of many ancient failures meant that landsliding was not considered to be \nwidespread or problematic in Great Britain.  However, costly disruptions to projects in the 1960s \nsuch as the Sevenoaks Road By-pass (Skempton and Weeks, 1976) and the Waltons Wood \nmotorway embankment (Early and Skempton, 1974) by reactivations of previously unknown \nlandslides led to the realisation that research was needed to determine the significance and extent \nof the problem.  Between 1985 and 1990, a \ndesk study was commissioned by the \nDepartment of the Environment (DoE) to \nestablish the extent and significance of \nlandsliding in Great Britain.  This involved \nresearching all possible sources of \ninformation including reports, journals and \nBGS published geological maps and \nmemoirs.  Since 1995, the DoE database \nhas been incorporated into, and superseded \nby, the BGS National Landslide Database. \nThe National Landslide Database has been \ndeveloped by BGS and is, to date, the most \ncomprehensive source of information on \nlandslides in Great Britain.  It currently \nholds over 14,000 records of landslide \nevents with each landslide documented as \nfully as possible (Figure 1).  Each landslide \nrecord can hold information on over 35 \nattributes including location, dimensions, \nlandslide type, trigger, damage caused, \nslope aspect, material, movement date, \nvegetation, hydrogeology, age, \ndevelopment and a full bibliographic \nreference.   \nThe database draws together information \nfrom many resources, generally only \navailable to and known about by specialists, for use by the public and practitioners.  Data come \nfrom a variety of sources including published BGS geological maps and revision surveys.  Other \nsources include commissioned and research studies and a number of regional databases inherited \nor compiled by BGS since the 1970s.  The information is corporately maintained and held in \ndigital format that can be adapted and updated so it will be useable for decades to come.  The \ndatabase is linked to a GIS which displays the landslides as point data.  The BGS Landslides Team \nis currently working towards making selected information from the database freely available \nthrough the GeoIndex, the BGS online GIS. \n \n2.2  National landslide hazard and susceptibility map: GeoSure \nGeoSure was developed by BGS as a digital landslide hazard assessment of the British mainland;   \nError! Reference source not found. is a simplified map of the GeoSure dataset. \nGeoSure was derived using a methodology, which combined both heuristic and deterministic \nassessment.  The heuristic approach used expert judgement to assess and classify the susceptibility \nof hazard, and determined the geological and topographical conditions likely to cause landsliding \n(Soeters and Van Westen, 1996).  The deterministic approach assessed these causative factors and \ngave each one a rating according to their relative importance in causing slope instability.  The \nmost important controlling factors of landsliding in Great Britain were identified as slope angle, \nhydrogeology, climate and the presence of discontinuities.  After several iterations, three key \nfactors were used - slope, geology and bedrock discontinuities: \n \nFigure 1 Current distribution of landslides held in \nthe National Landslide Database \nA slope model was derived directly from the NEXTMapTM digital terrain model of Britain.  The \nNEXTMapTM dataset was generated from an airborne survey and the one that was used has a 5m \nresolution.  This resolution was considered too detailed and too memory intensive for nationwide \nuse, so it was resampled to 25 m for use in GeoSure.  \nDigital geological polygons were assigned a score defining the potential of that material to fail.  \nThe score is based on an additive algorithm that incorporates material strength, permeability and \nknown susceptibility to instability of different lithologies, combined with slope angle.  The \ngeological data was based upon geotechnical data, literature reviews and specialist geological \nexpertise. \nDiscontinuities influence the strength of a material, its susceptibility to failure and its ability to \nallow water to penetrate a rock mass.  Detailed information about rock discontinuities was not \nconsistently available for the majority \nof rock types in Britain.  Therefore \ncategories were defined in line with \nthose used in the British Standard \n5930: Field Description of Rocks and \nSoils (British Standards Institute, \n1990) and by Bieniawski (1989).  \nThe methodology applied is flexible \nenough to allow alteration of the \nalgorithm in the future (nationally or \nlocally) and includes other factors \nsuch as the presence and nature of \nsuperficial deposits.  Once all the \ncontributing factors were identified, \nthey were combined using a multi-\ncriterion technique.  The multi-\ncriterion approach applied a series of \nrules against the available data to \nprovide a susceptibility \u2018score\u2019 for \neach location in Britain.  A high score \ndoes not necessarily mean that the \nlandslide has happened in the past or \nwill do so in the future but that the \nconditions mean there is a potential \nfor future landsliding. \n \n2.3  New landslide mapping techniques \nNational-scale landslide mapping has been carried out in the UK since BGS started geological \nmapping in 1835.  Today, BGS geologists use a combination of remote sensing and field \ninterpretation to survey landslides.   \nBGS\u00b7SIGMAmobile is the BGS digital field data capture system running on rugged tablet PCs \nwith integrated GPS units and used as standard for all geological mapping activities (Jordan et al., \n2008).  The development of this technology has provided an accurate and rapid mapping \nmethodology for field surveys and has enabled digital data to be directly collected and \ninterrogated by GIS in the field.  Geologist are able to create accurate geological and \ngeomorphological maps in the field, capture landslide information that is directly linked to the \nNational Landslide Database, make digital sketches and take photographs, which are all linked to  \ncorporate datasets. \nFigure 2 Simplified map of GeoSure\n  \nFigure 3 BGS\u2022SIGMAmobile being used in the field \n \n3  Landslide observatory case study: Hollin Hill, Yorkshire, UK \nThe Hollin Hill landslide is located in the north \nof England in Yorkshire (Figure 4).  It is \nlocated in a glacial outwash valley, on the \nsouth facing side with a slope of approximately \n12\u00ba.  The unstable ground extends for a \ndistance of 200 m down the slope, and for a \nwidth of several hundred metres.   \nThe landslide is currently active and scientific \nresearch at this site has been designed to \nenable BGS to accurately monitor and \neventually predict movement of the landslide.  \nIt brings together a combination of field \nsurveying, geomorphological, geophysical, \nengineering and hydrogeological expertise at \nBGS.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4 Location map of the Hollin Hill\nlandslide observatory, Yorkshire, UK\n3.1 Geology \nThe geology of the Hollin Hill landslide (Figure 5) comprises a Jurassic sequence from the Redcar \nMudstone Formation at the base, with an outcrop of the Staithes Sandstone Formation running \nacross the middle section of the slope.  The Whitby Mudstone Formation overlies this, with the \nupper part of the slope composed of the Dogger Formation.   \n \nThe Redcar Mudstone Formation forms the base of the Lias Group and comprises up to 200 m of \nmainly dark grey mudstones and siltstones; subsidiary thin limestones (concentrated in the lower \nthird), very fine grained sandstones, and sideritic and \u2018chamositic\u2019 ironstone beds and nodules are \nalso present (Powell, 1984). \n \nThe Staithes Sandstone Formation (Middle Lias) comprises approximately 20 m of fossiliferous, \nmicaceous, calcareous, very fine- to fine-grained sandstone.  It is yellow-brown at outcrop but \ngrey when fresh with interbedded grey siltstone and silty mudstone.   \n \nThe Whitby Mudstone Formation, which forms the upper part of the Lias Group, typically consists \nof bluish grey to dark grey, sparsely fossiliferous, fissile, locally bituminous mudstones and \nsiltstones.  Bands of calcareous concretions are common at some horizons.  At its thickest, it \nreaches about 25-30m thickness in the study area. \n \nThe Dogger Formation is composed of a massive, fine to medium-grained calcareous sandstone, \nup to 2.7 metres in thickness (Gaunt et al., 1980).  The Dogger Formation forms an extensive flat \nplateau behind the slope of Hollin Hill.   \n \nFigure 5 Geological map of the Hollin Hill research site (Geological map, BGS \u00a9 NERC 2009.  \nBase map, Ordnance Survey \u00a9 Crown copyright.

Licence number \n100017897\/2009). \n \n \n \n3.2 Landslide \nThe instability of the slope at Hollin Hill is largely controlled by the geology, particularly the \nWhitby Mudstone Formation, which is highly prone to landsliding (Jenkins et al., 2005).  Figure 6 \nshows part of the landslide where several landslide features can be distinguished. \n \n \nFigure 6 Annotated photograph of part of the Hollin Hill landslide \n \nThis slope forms a complex landslide according to the classifications by Varnes (1978), the IAEG \nCommission on Landslides (1990), the Working Party on World Landslide Inventory (WP\/WLI, \n1990; 1993and Cruden and Varnes (1996).  It is characterised by shallow rotational failures at the \ntop of the slope in the Whitby Mudstone Formation, which move through an area of translational \nlandslide movement and \u201ccascades\u201d over the in situ Staithes Sandstone Formation feeding into \nfour larger-scale flow-lobes at the bottom of the slope (Figure 7).  In recent years, annual \nmovement of the lobes has been in the order of tens of centimetres.  The morphology of the slope \nis complex with numerous isolated shallow failures and slumping.  Locally the slope becomes \nvery steep where slipped material has accumulated to form lobes. \nMovement typically occurs in the winter months (i.e. January and February) when the slope is at \nits wettest.  During this period water can be observed accumulating in the basins caused by \nrotational slips towards the top of the slope, and can be seen emerging from the front of the lobes.  \nA spring line also extends across the base of the slope where the Staithes Sandstone gives way to \nthe underlying Redcar Mudstone Formation.  Runoff from the valley floor and sides appears to \ndrain into the stream located at the valley centre (Chambers et al., 2008). \n \n \nFigure 7 Hollin Hill geophysics survey plan (\u00a9UKP\/Getmapping Licence No UKP\/2009\/01).  \nBlack dotted lines indicate lobe features. \n \n3.3 Methodology \nBGS is monitoring the site using a combination of several new technologies including geological, \nhydrogeological, geomorphological and geophysical expertise.  The overarching objective of the \nresearch is to develop a 4D landslide monitoring system that can characterise the subsurface \nstructure of the landslide, and reveal the hydraulic precursors to movement.  The movement is \nthen captured using surveying techniques. \n \n3.3.1 LiDAR \nBoth aerial and terrestrial LiDAR surveys have been carried out at this site.  These have provided \nBGS with the unique opportunity to appraise the relative merits of the different technologies and \ntheir application monitoring an active landslide site in the United Kingdom.   \nThe first (baseline) survey recorded the ground surface of the landslide and surrounding slope area \nin three-dimensions.  Subsequent surveys of this active landslide will record the movement of the \nslope.  Terrestrial surveys are carried out at twelve-monthly intervals and the data collected in the \nfield by LiDAR and differential GPS are entered into a computer-modelling package (Figure 8).  \nThe results are processed to provide data to model the way in which the landslide is moving.  \nInformation obtained by the Terrestrial LiDAR survey will allow the changing shape of the \nsurface to be monitored. \n \n \nFigure 8 Point cloud array from terrestrial LiDAR scan captured in 2007.  The rear scar of a \nrotated block at the top of the slope can be seen here. \n \n3.3.2 Geophysics \nGeophysical techniques are playing an increasingly important role in the investigation and \nmonitoring of landslides (e.g. Jongmans and Garambois, 2007); such methods are proving to be \nparticularly effective for revealing the 3D structure, failure surfaces, and the hydrogeological \nregimes associated with landslides.  Geoelectrical techniques, such as resistivity and self-potential, \nare particularly applicable to the study of hydraulic processes associated with landslides (Jomard \net al., 2007).  The great strengths of these techniques are that they provide spatial or volumetric \ninformation at the site scale, and are sensitive to hydraulic changes in the subsurface. \n \nGeophysical investigation of this site enables the study of any movement of the landslide in three \ndimensions and provides geophysical data across the whole of the Hollin Hill research site.  The \nfollowing geophysical techniques were used: Geocarta mobile resistivity mapping; Electrical \nResistivity Tomography (ERT) lines (2D) and grids (3D); Self Potential (SP) profiles (2D) and \ngrids (3D).  Figure 7 shows the geophysical survey plan.  The primary focus of the ongoing \nresearch is to use time-lapse ERT and SP to characterise subsurface structure (e.g. Friedel et al., \n2006);  and to monitor hydrogeological changes (i.e. water table (e.g. Revil et al., 2003), moisture \ncontent, seepage pathways), and investigate the link between these changes and the movement of \nthe landslide (e.g. Perrone et al., 2004).  \n \nIn the spring of 2008, an automated time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ALERT) system \nwas permanently installed on the site (Kuras et al., 2009; Ogilvy et al., 2009).  The ALERT \ninstrument uses wireless telemetry (in this case GPRS) to communicate with an office based PC, \nwhich runs control software and a database management system.  The control software schedules \ndata acquisition, whilst the database management system stores, processes and inverts the \nremotely streamed ERT data.  Once installed and configured, the system operates autonomously \nwithout manual intervention.  Modifications to the ALERT system at this site have included the \naddition of environmental and geotechnical sensors to monitor rainfall, ground movement and \npore pressure changes within the landslide (Figure 9).  The system is housed in a weatherproof \nenclosure and is powered by batteries charged by a wind turbine & solar panels. \n \nFigure 9 Site plan showing the location of the ALERT station, ERT monitoring arrays (red lines), \nmajor geomorphologic features (white-dashed lines) and bedrock geology (black dashed lines). (\u00a9 \nUKP\/Getmapping Licence No. UKP2008\/01) \n \n3.4 Preliminary results \nGood resistivity contrasts between the slipped material and sandstone bedrock has allowed us to \nuse resistivity mapping data and ERT models to define the geometry of the landslide.  The \nresistivity map revealed the extent of the in-situ and slipped Whitby Mudstone Formation (low \nresistivity), and in-situ Staithes Sandstone (high resistivity).  These data were complemented by \nthe ERT models in which the lobes of slipped mudstone could be distinguished from the \nunderlying sandstone bedrock; in particular, slip surfaces can be seen in the resistivity models \nwhere the mudstone lobe has overridden the sandstone bedrock (Figure 10).  \n \n \nFigure 10 2D ERT model and SP profile \n \nA static 3D ERT model was generated from data collected shortly after the ALERT system was \ninstalled (Figure 11).  This model shows the three-dimensional structure of the landslide and is the \nreference model for future models to be measured against.  The geology of the hillslope is clearly \ndistinguished in the model: the Whitby Mudstone Formation (WMF) is a clay rich low resistivity \nformation (green-blue); the Staithes Sandstone Formation (SSF) has lower clay content and is \nmore resistive (pink-white); the underlying Redcar Mudstone Formation (RMF) displays a similar \nresistivity range to that of the WMF (green-blue).  The slipped WMF material of lobes 1 and 2 is \nclearly seen to override the SSF bedrock.  Detailed analysis of the resistivity image has revealed \nvariations in lobe thickness across the imaging area, which has subsequently been confirmed \nthrough intrusive investigations (i.e. drilling, augering, and cone penetration tests). \n \n \nFigure 11 Baseline 3D ERT model of the landslide generated from ALERT data. \nConclusion \nThis paper has provided an overview of the integrated scientific research BGS is \ncarrying out and outlined some of the technology and methodologies used to collect \ndata for interpretation. \nAcknowledgements \nThese research results are part of a project financially supported by the Natural Environment \nResearch Council (NERC).
