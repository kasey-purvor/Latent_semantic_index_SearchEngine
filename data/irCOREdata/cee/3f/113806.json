Corbett \nSurrey Morphology Group \n \nAbstract \n \nThe approach of Canonical Typology has proved fruitful for investigating a range of \nproblems in syntax, inflectional morphology and most recently in phonology. It is \ntherefore logical to take a canonical approach to derivational morphology. It provides a \nnew perspective on some old issues, showing how previous key ideas fit together. The \ncriteria proposed prove to have some degree of external justification. And from the point \nof view of canonical typology the results are particularly promising, since the criteria are \ninterestingly different from those proposed in other domains.  \n1 Introduction \nIn this paper I take a novel perspective on derivational morphology, that of canonical \ntypology. This will mean revisiting some basic issues within derivational morphology \n(which is something we should do at intervals). Conversely, from the viewpoint of \ncanonical typology, derivational morphology proves particularly difficult and \u2013 \neventually \u2013 quite exciting.  \n2 Canonical typology \nAdopting a canonical approach means that we look for definitions which allow us to \ndistinguish between interesting sets of data, and we take such definitions to their logical \n - 2 - \nend point. This enables us to build theoretical spaces of possibilities. Only when we have \nestablished our clear definitions, and the space they define, do we investigate how this \nspace is populated with real instances. Canonical instances are those that match the \ncanon: they are the best, the clearest, the indisputable ones. Given that they have to match \nup to a logically determined standard, such instances are unlikely to be frequent. They are \nmore likely to be rare, and may even be non-existent. This is not a difficulty. The \nconvergence of criteria fixes a canonical point from which the phenomena actually found \ncan be calibrated. This approach has been worked out particularly for inflectional \nmorphology, as well as for syntax, and more recently for phonology.  \n \nIt is worth distinguishing clearly between canonical and prototypical, though rereading a \nfew pages of Rosch should be sufficient to convince the reader of the differences. A \nprototype, at least in the term\u2019s prototypical use, has an exemplar, is in speakers\u2019 heads (it \nis claimed to be psychologically real), and can vary across cultures. Canonical instances \nneed have no exemplar, they are not claimed to be part of speakers\u2019 competence (they are \ntheoretical constructs of linguists), and they are ideally invariant. An analogy to the \ncanonical is the system of cardinal vowels. Starting from vowels of different degrees of \nopenness and frontness, phoneticians following Daniel Jones invoke a potential vowel \nthat is maximally close and maximally front. This serves as an anchoring point for the \nvowel space, irrespective of whether we find such an extreme vowel in a given language. \n \nIn canonical typology, inflectional morphology has been treated by Baerman, Brown & \nCorbett (2005: 27-35), Spencer (2005), Stump (2005b, 2006), Corbett (2007a, 2007b, \n - 3 - \n2009), Nikolaeva & Spencer (2008), Stump & Finkel (2008) and Thornton (2008), and \nphonology by Hyman (2009). In syntax, agreement has occupied centre stage, for \ninstance in Corbett (2003, 2006), Comrie (2003), Evans (2003), Polinsky (2003), Seifart \n(2005: 156-174) and Suthar (2006: 178-98).  \n \nA working bibliography of this growing body of research can be found at \nhttp:\/\/www.surrey.ac.uk\/LIS\/SMG\/CanonicalTypology\/index.htm.  \n \n3 Canonical derivational morphology \nI will try to characterize synchronic canonical derivational morphology. That is, that part \nof morphology that deserves our particular attention as derivational, within a currently \nfunctioning language system. The diachronic interest of derivation will have a secondary \nrole. Hence our two principles: \n \nPrinciple I: Canonical derived words have clear indicators of their synchronic status.  \n \nPrinciple II: Canonical derived words are fully distinct from their base.  \n \nPrinciple I is made explicit in three criteria. \n3.1 Many-to-many substitutability \nCriterion 1: Canonical derived words consist of a base and at least one derivational \nmarker, each of which can be substituted to yield another derived word. \n - 4 - \n \nThe key idea is that a canonical derived word gives clear indicators of its status as \nsynchronically derived. So if we take paint-er, we can substitute the base with another \nbase, and indeed many other verbs fit there. We can also substitute the affix and so \nestablish that paint is a base  \n \n(1) Many-to-many substitutability: a simple example \n \npainter \u2190 paint   \n    \nrunner  painting drawing \nsinger  repaint redraw \n \nIf we start from English painter, we see that the base is paint. Given that base, we can \nsubstitute various derivational markers in place of \u2013er, for instance, we can derive \npainting and repaint. From the other perspective, if we hold the derivational marker \u2013er \nconstant, we can substitute other bases, as in runner and singer. Thus we have many-to-\nmany substitutability of base and derivational marker. \n \nLet us now turn to a more substantial example. We consider Russian, and in particular its \ncolour terms. The system is specially interesting, since Russian is claimed, unusually, to \nhave twelve basic colour terms. As part of an investigation of the system, Corbett & \nMorgan (1988: 38) plotted the word-formation potential of these basic colour terms. They \n - 5 - \nbased themselves on the dictionary of Worth, Kozak & Johnson (1970); some of the \nresults are given in (2). In the left column we see the basic colour terms. Along the top \nare arranged various means of word-formation (and these are combined when they have \nthe same distribution with respect to colour terms). Where a particular term (listed on the \nleft) combines, according to the source, with the word-formational device (listed along \nthe top), this is indicated with a tick. Thus belyj \u2018white\u2019 combines with -ovatyj \u2018-ish\u2019 to \ngive belovatyj \u2018whitish\u2019. The column \u2018Total 1\u2019 indicates the number of forms \n(derivational and compounded) arising from the combination with the items indicated \nalong the top of the table (and since some columns include more than one formative, the \ntotal can exceed the number of the columns). The more significant column \u2018Total 2\u2019, \ngives the number of items formed from the basic colour terms using all the devices listed \nin the dictionary.  \n \n(2) Word-formation potential of Russian basic colour terms  \n \n \n - 6 - \nWe see that there is a substantial number of bases, which can be shown to be available for \nthe addition of various affixes. And similarly there is a substantial number of affixes, \nwhich are available for different bases. However, as is often the case in derivational \nsystems, the coverage is patchy; numerous combinations are not attested. (For the study \nof colour terms, it is noteworthy that if a new term takes on basic status it can rapidly \nreach the expected frequency level, but acquiring derivatives takes much longer, as \ndocumented in Corbett & Morgan 1988.) \n \nWe have taken affixation as the canonical type of morphology, as implied in Criterion 1. \nOf course, derivation can also be realized through other morphological means, including \nintercalation, reduplication and stress alternations. Such derivations would be less \ncanonical in terms of the morphological means, but could be more or less canonical \naccording to the other criteria to be discussed. \n3.2 Regular (transparent) semantics \nCriterion 2:  The meaning of a canonical derived word can be computed regularly from \nthe meaning of the base and the additional meaning of the derivation. \n \nThis criterion is relatively straightforward. Consider these Russian data: \n \n - 7 - \n(3) Deverbal agent nouns in Russian \n \npisat\u00b4 \u2018write\u2019 pisatel\u00b4 \u00b4writer\u2019 \n\u010ditat\u00b4 \u2018read\u2019 \u010ditatel\u00b4 \u2018reader\u2019 \nosnovat\u00b4 \u2018found\u2019 osnovatel\u00b4 \u2018founder\u2019 \n \u2026ii    \nBUT: dvigat\u00b4 \u2018move\u2019 dvigatel\u00b4 \u2018motor\u2019 \n \nThe simple point here is that most of the derived nouns are canonical in terms of \nCriterion 2; their meaning is regularly derived from the parts. However, dvigatel\u00b4 \u2018motor\u2019 \nis less canonical: its primary meaning is not what would be predicted from the base and \nthe derivational affix.iii See Hippisley (forthcoming) for a Network Morphology analysis \nof the data, and Lieber (2005: 403-406) for sources and discussion of comparable forms \nin English.   \n \nThe canonical ideal would be full compositionality in meaning. Dressler (2005: 271) \nargues that Frege\u2019s principle of semantic compositionality can hold only for syntax and it \ncannot hold fully for word formation. He suggests that accepted words are lexicalized, \nwhile \u2018not yet accepted neologisms, generally, realise only one of the potential meanings \nof a compound or derivation.\u2019 (2005: 271). We should still take full semantic regularity \nas canonical, since that is the logical end point, even if Dressler should prove right and \nfull semantic regularity should turn out to be not fully attainable in derivation. The point \nwill need further discussion (\u00a73.7), since semantic regularity is taken as a possible \n - 8 - \ncriterion for distinguishing inflectional morphology from derivational (see, for instance, \nStump 2005a: 55).iv  \n \nNote that this approach does not mean that we need to treat affixes as morphemes. We \nmay agree with Carstairs-McCarthy (2005: 22): \u2018It will be understandable if many \nreaders conclude that the term \u201cmorpheme\u201d has hindered rather than helped our \nunderstanding of how morphology works.\u2019 Criterion 2 applies equally well if one \nassumes a realizational account. \n \n3.3 Transparent form \nCriterion 3:  The form of a canonical derived word is transparent: its structure, \nconsisting of base and derivational marker(s), is evident. \n \nAt one level this is simple. If we look again at the derived forms in (3), the regular pattern \nexhibited by these and by a considerable number of further items is sufficient to suggest \nthat the form is transparent.  \n \nBeyond that there are more difficult issues. There are instances where a derived word is \nrecognizably different from a simplex word; Kaisse (2005) gives a fine overview of such \ncases in English, associated with the system of stress. I suggest that this type of \ndifferentiation is not the canonical type. As always in canonical investigations, we need \nto be aware of the \u201cVenus effect\u201d. If asked about planets, Venus is the easiest example, \nbecause it is most often visible \u2013 we can point to it. But it does not follow that it therefore \n - 9 - \nhas any other special status. I suggest that the transparency of form of a canonical derived \nitem is by comparison with its base: a canonical derived word is recognizably different \nfrom its base. \n \nWe should also ask whether there is evidence within the morphological system for \ntransparency of form; in other words whether morphological rules have access to the \ninternal structure of words. In his review of Anderson\u2019s A-Morphous Morphology, \nCarstairs-McCarthy provides insightful discussion of this issue, stating that the evidence \nis \u2018frustratingly equivocal\u2019 (1993: 213). For discussion of how affix ordering is \ndetermined see Hyman (2003); and for the issue of selection between base and affixes see \nLieber (2006), and especially Plag & Baayen (2009). \n3.4 Outcome: synchronic derivability \nThe combination of Criteria 1, 2 and 3 means that the speaker could if required re-create \na canonical derived word. Equally the listener could decompose a canonical derived word \nin order to parse it (see \u00a76.1 for discussion of possible evidence supporting this view). In \nother words, canonical derivation is recognizable; even if the form is in fact stored, we \ncould create or parse it \u2018again\u2019 on the fly. In this respect, derivation is similar to inflection \n(see \u00a74 below). Of course, synchronic derivability is a key part of productivity; the \nconcern with what is possible as opposed to what is actually found in derivational \nmorphology goes back at least to Aronoff (1976); for a survey of this area see Bauer \n(2005), and for an overview of constraints on productivity see Rainer (2005). \n \nWe now turn to the second principle: \n - 10 - \n \nPrinciple II: Canonical derived words are fully distinct from their base.  \n \nThere are two relevant criteria here:  \n3.5 Separate lexical index \nCriterion 4: A derived word has a separate lexical index. \n \nThis is the reflection of the distinct nature of a derived word, as expressed in Principle II. \nA derived word is a different lexeme, and has its place in the lexicon. An implementation \nof this state of affairs can be seen, for instance, in the Network Morphology account in \nHippisley (forthcoming).  \n3.6 Additional semantic predicate \nCriterion 5: A derived word includes an additional semantic predicate in comparison \nwith its base. \n \nThis criterion is due to Andrew Spencer; see, for instance, the proposed characterization \nof a canonical affix in Spencer & Lu\u00eds (forthcoming): \u2018Affix: canonically a suffix which \nrealizes the value of a morphosyntactic property (inflection) or added semantic predicate \n(derivation).\u2019 Thus the divide between canonical inflection and canonical derivation is \nlocated in the addition, or not, of a semantic predicate (see \u00a74.1).  \n - 11 - \n3.7 Nameworthiness \nDerivational morphology serves to create terms for nameworthy concepts (cf. Mithun & \nCorbett 1999, where the discussion is concerned with incorporation, but the point is \nequally valid here). Derived words are created where there is a need. This is what gives \nrise to the \u2018patchy\u2019 nature of derivational morphology, its appearance of being a set of \nincomplete projects (see Anderson 1985a); this is the picture we see clearly in (2) above. \nThis observation runs counter to the criteria given in \u00a73, and is not itself a criterion for \ncanonical derivation. Rather it shows clearly the difference between what is prototypical \nand what is canonical. If we wished to characterize prototypical derivation in a particular \nlanguage we might well include the requirement that derived forms would denote \nnameworthy concepts and would constitute a partial system with numerous gaps. Our \nfirst concern, however, is to characterize canonical derivation. The fact that in this respect \nreality frequently departs from the canonical is interesting, though not surprising (and the \nsecond conclusion of Plag & Baayen 2009: 146-147, on the role of memory, is relevant \nhere). We return to the discrepancy between the canonical and the frequently observed \nin \u00a74.2.  \n4 Relation to previous key ideas \nIn this section we consider first how this approach relates to its roots in morphological \nresearch and then in terms of recent work on canonicity. \n4.1 For morphology \nIn the discussion above (\u00a73.4) we noted that canonical derivation shares characteristics \nwith canonical inflection. The literature includes many examples of investigations aiming \n - 12 - \nto distinguish derivation from inflection, for instance: Matthews (1974: 43-58), Anderson \n(1985b: 162-165), Bybee (1985: 81-110), Corbett (1987: 327-329), Scalise (1988), \nDressler (1989), Plank (1994), Wurzel (1996), Stump (1998), Booij (2000), Percov \n(2001: 69-112), Haspelmath (2002: 70-83), Bauer (2004), Carstairs-McCarthy (2005: \n18-20), Spencer (2005: 111-114) and Stump (2005a: 53-58). For a discussion of the \ndifference in terms of productivity see Carstairs-McCarthy (2002: 85-99). Several \nresearchers comment on the difficulty of drawing the distinction, and for good reason, as \nwe shall see: canonical derivation does indeed look rather like canonical inflection.  \n \nLet us start from the idea that the key difference in derivational morphology is that there \nis an additional semantic predicate. This makes the derived items sufficiently different \nfrom the base for it to require its own lexical index (\u00a73.5). It is here that the common \ndiagnostic of change of part of speech (word-class) fits in. Change of word class \nfrequently goes hand in hand with the addition of a semantic predicate. However, this is \nanother instance of the \u201cVenus effect\u201d. Change of part of speech is not a necessary \ncondition for derivation. Furthermore, according to Haspelmath (1996), it is not a \nsufficient condition either. Spencer (1999) talks of \u2018transposition\u2019, discussing examples \nwhere there is a change of part of speech but, he suggests, no more than that.v Hence \nchange of part of speech is a common but not necessary concomitant of adding a \nsemantic predicate.  \n \nLet us now view the problem from the side of inflection. Here, of all the criteria for \ninflectional morphology, obligatoriness is of special importance. This well-known \n - 13 - \ncriterion was highlighted by Jakobson, in his discussion of Boas (1938: 132-133). \nJakobson produced the famous quote: \u2018Thus the true difference between languages is not \nin what may or may not be expressed but in what must or must not be conveyed by the \nspeakers.\u2019 (1959\/1971: 492)vi The obligatoriness criterion for inflectional morphology is \nimportant for us because it addresses the issue of the extra predicate. If a form is \nobligatory this will not introduce an extra predicate. Thus, for instance, the selection of a \nform according to the dictates of syntax is obligatory (and inflectional), rather than \nderivational. Thus contextual inflection is canonical as inflection, and furthest from \nderivational morphology. However, inherent inflection too can be obligatory (thus an \nEnglish noun must be in one or other number) and hence not derivational.   \n4.2 For canonical typology \nFor canonical typology the investigation of derivational morphology is of considerable \ninterest, because it shows a new way in which canonical criteria can operate. The point is \nthat \u2018canonical derived word\u2019 is not to be described as other canonical notions, but rather \nwith a set of \u2018relative to\u2019 statements. A canonical derived item is calibrated in relation to \na base. It can be seen that this is the effect of Principles I and II. Canonically a derived \nword should be phonologically \u2018larger\u2019 than its base (not just large); it may have different \nstress perhaps (but not just the pattern of derived item). This is a new sort of typology, \nbut of course it answers directly to the underlying intuition in terms such as \u2018derived \nform\u2019.  \n \nWhile canonical derived forms are unusual, our typology situates several phenomena that \nare not canonical. There can be an additional semantic predicate without a change in form \n - 14 - \n(as in some instances of conversion). Or we can find items with a change in form but no \nadditional semantic predicate, as with so-called \u2018empty morphs\u2019 and \u2018superfluous \nmorphs\u2019, for which see Anderson (1992: 53-54; 2006: 199). As instances of empty \nmorphs in derivation, Anderson (2006: 199) gives English crime\/criminal, \npage\/paginate, sense\/sensuous, habit\/habitual\/habituate, where the elements in bold \nbring no additional semantics. Another type of non-canonical derivation is a phenomenon \npointed out by Stump, who writes (2005a: 64) \u2018Quite frequently in language, the sole \nmorphological expression of a lexeme\u2019s derivation is the way in which it inflects.\u2019 A \nconvincing example he gives is that of Sanskrit causativization, which involved shifting a \nverb into the tenth conjugation.  \n \n5 What evidence do we find for the canonical criteria proposed? \nThere are two types of evidence, suggesting that the criteria we have used have some \nvalidity. \n5.1 Psycholinguistic evidence \nIt is important that we interpret psycholinguistic evidence with the caution which \npsycholinguists typically show.vii There are some types of evidence here which give \ncause for encouragement. First there is strong evidence for the importance of semantic \ntransparency, as shown in the classic article by Marslen-Wilson, Tyler, Waksler & Older \n(1994), using cross-modal priming; this is directly relevant to Criterion 2.   \n \n - 15 - \nA second type of work is that exemplified by Janssen & Caramazza (2003). In a \nproduction experiment, speakers of Dutch named pictures using phrases consisting of \ndeterminer and noun. By analysis of reaction times, Janssen & Caramazza concluded that \nwhen diminutives were used, the base noun\u2019s gender had an impact on the selection of \nthe determiner even though the derived noun was of different gender. This can be seen as \nevidence that the base is still accessible to the speaker in derived forms (which is relevant \nto Criterion 3). There is interesting evidence for the decomposition of derivationally \ncomplex words, and of items which appear so in their form, though they are no longer \ntransparently derived (e.g. English hardly) is presented in Marslen-Wilson & Tyler \n(2007: 831-832) and in Marslen-Wilson (2007); this too is directly relevant to Criterion 3. \n \nAnd then the work on morphological family size is particularly germane here (de Jong, \nSchreuder & Baayen 2000). \u2018The morphological family size of a word is the type count \nof all the complex words in which this word appears as a constituent \u2026\u2019 (Moscoso del \nPrado Mart\u00edn, Deutsch, Frost, Schreuder, De Jong & Baayen (2005: 496), and references \nthere. Note that this includes compounds together with instances of derivational \nmorphology. In a series of papers, Harald Baayen and his associates have shown that, all \nother things being equal, words with larger family sizes are responded to more quickly in \nvisual lexical decision than are words with smaller families. I had taken this as evidence \nfor the effect of transparency of form of derived words. However, in a recent paper, \nMilin, Kuperman, Kosti\u0107 & Baayen (2009: 247-248) state that the family size effect has \nalways been understood as semantic in nature, but that their recent work suggests rather \nthat it is \u2018a composite effect that bundles together effects of semantic similarity and \n - 16 - \neffects of paradigmatic structure.\u2019 One of the results of Schreuder & Baayen (1997) is is \nvery relevant here. They compared monomorphemic Dutch nouns in visual lexical \ndecision experiment. Those nouns with a larger morphological family size were \nresponded to more quickly. (Recall that family size refers to the number of derivatives \n(types), where derivatives include both derivations and compounds.) Thus speakers have \naccess to the fact that certain lexical entries also function as a base for derivation, which \nis surprising given that monomorphemic nouns were investigated. This interesting result \nbears on \u00a73.4. \n5.2 Diachronic evidence \nThe evidence here concerns the possessive adjectives of Slavonic. These are of \ninteresting status, but are arguably derived forms. The particular derivational affix \nrequired to form the possessive adjective, in some Slavonic languages, is predictable \nfrom the inflectional class of the noun; in others the gender is the best predictor. Consider \nthese patterns (data and sources in Corbett 1987: 325-326): \n \n - 17 - \n(7) Motivation for the possessive adjective in Slavonic \n \nInflectional class of \nbase \nI II II \nGender of base M M F \nRussian \n(original system) \nIvan \u2018Ivan\u2019 \n> Ivanov \npapa \u2018daddy\u2019 \n> papin \nmama \u2018mummy\u2019 \n > mamin \nUpper Sorbian \n(innovative system) \nJan \u2018Jan\u2019 \n> Janowy \nstarosta \u2018headman\u2019  \n> starostowy  \nsotra \u2018sister\u2019 \n> sot\u0159iny \n \nWe see that in languages like Russian, the form of the possessive adjective is predictable \nfrom the noun\u2019s inflectional class and not from its gender. This is clear from the column, \nwhich has nouns like papa \u2018daddy\u2019, which belong to inflection class II. This class \ncontains mainly feminine nouns; thus for the examples in this column the inflectional \nclass and the gender do not overlap as they normally do, and we can see which is the \npredictor. Several Slavonic languages (Upper Sorbian: Belorussian, Slovenian, Czech, \nSlovak, and Lower Sorbian) have moved away from this original situation and now form \nthe possessive adjective according to gender (clear again from the papa\/starosta column). \nThe point for present purposesviii is that at the time of change, speakers must have been \naware of the affix as being derivational, and \u2018rederived\u2019 a new form according to gender \nrather than inflectional class. \n - 18 - \n6 Conclusion \nBy investigating the notion of canonical derivational morphology we have gained a new \nperspective on an old problem. From the point of view of canonical typology, the results \nare exciting, since the picture that emerges is rather different from all previous \ninvestigations of this type, in that canonicity is here defined always as relative to other \nphenomena. Instances of canonical derivational morphology are rare, of course, as is \nnormally the case for canonical typology. In this particular instance, however, what is \ntypical and what is canonical are very different. And this is a valid view of derivational \nmorphology, where for particular languages we can often specify the systematicity but \nalso point to a patchy coverage of the space of possibilities. This tension arises because \nderived words are typically not just the sum of their parts, but are also \u201cword-worthy\u201d \n(derived to meet a lexical need), a property which tends to weaken the connection of the \nderived word to its components.  \n \n - 19 - \n \nReferences \nAnderson, Stephen R. 1985a.

I also wish to thank Matthew Baerman, \nDunstan Brown, Marina Chumakina, Andrew Hippisley, Hans Christian Lusch\u00fctzky,\t\r \u00a0\nGreg Stump, Claire Turner and especially Andrew Spencer for helpful discussion of the \nissues. A version was read at the conference on Universals and typology in word-\nformation, Ko\u0161ice, August 2009; I am grateful to those present for their comments, and to \ntwo anonymous referees for their generous reports. One of them provided several helpful \nideas for taking the research further. \nii For lists of the many further examples see Lazova (1974) or Zaliznjak (1977). \niii The agentive examples in Russian do indeed appear to be those whose meaning is \nregularly derived from the parts, while the instrument examples are more idiosyncratic. \niv See also the discussion of regularity in Mutz (2008). \nv Another more contentious instance concerns the bafflingly complex behaviour of \nRussian numerals. According to one account (Corbett 1978), their different syntactic and \nmorphological patterns can be described in terms of changes of part of speech: there is no \nquestion here, however, of any additional predicate or of a derivational relation. \nvi Mel\u00b4\u010duk (1960\/1974) discusses this criterion and points out (1974: 111) that he wrote \nhis 1960 article in 1958, before he saw Jakobson\u2019s 1959 article. Percov (1996: 40, 2001: \n71) traces the history of the notion back through Jakobson to Boas and before him to \nMaspero (1934: 35). However, I believe Jakobson is right to give primacy to Boas, since \nthe idea can be also found in Boas, in his Introduction to the Handbook of American \nIndian languages (1911: 35-43, especially 40-43).  \nvii See Bauer (2001: 100-124) for a review of psycholinguistic work relating to \nproductivity. \nviii These data were cited in Corbett (2009), but to illustrate a slightly different point, \nnamely that inflectional class membership may be predictive of other things. \n"}
