The inherent broadcast\ncapabilities of satellites render them an attrac-\ntive platform for the delivery of multimedia\nbroadcast and multicast services (MBMS), in\nparticular those featuring large and widely dis-\ntributed audiences.\nSatellite digital multimedia broadcasting\n(SDMB) implements a satellite-based broad-\ncast\/multicast layer, which is complementary to\nthe third-generation (3G) mobile networks and\nincreases their content delivery capacity [1]. The\nsatellite component is designed to reuse as much\nas possible the cellular network architecture\nstandardized within the 3G Partnership Project\n(3GPP). This way, the development of new prod-\nucts and technology is minimized, and via inte-\ngration of maintenance, billing, and security\noperations within the overall cellular manage-\nment system, the cellular company\u2019s operational\nefficiency is exploited. The satellite component\nenables immediate full coverage service provi-\nsion and low transmission cost for point-to-mul-\ntipoint applications addressing a large number of\ngeographically dispersed terminals. On the other\nhand, the terrestrial cellular component is best\nsuited for point-to-point applications and also\npoint-to-multipoint applications with high geo-\ngraphical selectivity.\nThe first validation of the SDMB innovative\nsystem concept with field trials has been the rai-\nson d\u2019\u00eatre of the European Commission\u2019s R&D\nproject Mobile Digital Broadcast Satellite\n(MoDiS) [2]. In the context of MoDiS an experi-\nmental platform representative of the integrated\nsatellite and terrestrial cellular network system\narchitecture of SDMB was developed. The plat-\nform has been used for extensive field trials that\ngave the opportunity to demonstrate the innova-\ntive service delivery proposal made by SDMB in\nclose synergy with terrestrial cellular networks.\nWe first provide a brief introduction to the\nABSTRACT\nThe close synergy between a satellite system\nand terrestrial mobile cellular networks for cost-\nefficient content delivery to mobile users lies at\nthe core of the satellite digital multimedia broad-\ncasting system concept. Having already rich\nresearch and design work behind it, much of\nwhich has been carried out in the framework of\nEuropean R&D projects, the system has recently\nseen the end of its first field trials, which relied\non an experimental platform representing the\nfuture operational system. The article reports\nthe outcomes of these trials that confirmed the\ntechnical feasibility of the system concept and\nprovided valuable hints for the subsequent sys-\ntem design stages.\nANDRIKOPOULOS LAYOUT  10\/6\/05  12:46 PM  Page 82\n \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

We conclude\noutlining the positioning of SDMB within digital\nmultimedia broadcasting and the next steps that\nconstitute the continuation of MoDiS.\nTHE MODIS TESTBED: A REPRESENTATIVE\nPLATFORM FOR THE SDMB SYSTEM\nThe SDMB architecture (Fig. 1a) combines\nbent-pipe geostationary satellites with terrestrial\nrepeaters, also called intermediate module\nrepeaters (IMRs), to form a large point-to-mul-\ntipoint content delivery network (CDN) toward\nmobile users [1]. The satellite component oper-\nates in the IMT2000 mobile satellite systems\n(MSS) frequency band, which is adjacent to the\nband employed by the respective mobile terres-\ntrial systems. SDMB provides a unidirectional\ndistribution link toward mobile terminals and\nadopts the standard wideband code-division mul-\ntiple access (WCDMA) air interface [3] used in\n3G terrestrial cellular networks, enabling maxi-\nmum reuse of terrestrial Universal Mobile\nTelecommunications System (T-UMTS) technol-\nogy and cost-effective terminals [4].\nThe SDMB hub hosts the functional equiva-\nlents of the 3GPP Node B and radio network\ncontroller (RNC) nodes. A return link via the\nterrestrial mobile network, which may be 2.5G\nor 3G, enables access to all the standard interac-\ntive services of the terrestrial cellular network as\nwell as functions related to the transfer of point-\nto-multipoint services over the satellite compo-\nnent, such as security-related transactions and\napplication-level retransmissions of corrupted or\nlost content. The system makes use of an\nenhanced version of the 3GPP broadcast multi-\ncast service center (BM-SC), which, on top of its\nstandard functionality [5], routes user and signal-\ning data toward the satellite component and\nensures normal execution\/termination of the rel-\nevant protocol procedures.\nThe validation of this system architecture has\nbeen the main objective of the trials carried out\nin the context of the MoDiS project. The experi-\nment consisted of setting up a representative\nplatform of the SDMB system in Monaco, one\nof the most challenging \u2014 if not hostile \u2014 satel-\nlite signal propagation environments in Europe.\nThe platform is depicted in Fig. 1b, and its\nrelevance to the SDMB architecture is outlined\nbelow:\n\u2022 Due to the lack of an existing satellite able to\nprovide enough power and bandwidth in the\nL\/S frequency bands, satellite transmission\nwas emulated by placing a UMTS Node B at a\nhigh-altitude location in Monaco. A helix\nantenna giving a circular polarization of the\nUMTS waveform was used. The transmit\npower of the Node B was set to yield the same\nreception levels at the input of the MoDiS ter-\nminal as those corresponding to satellite trans-\nmission in the predefined test area. For the\ntrials only, transmission was performed in the\nterrestrial IMT2000 frequency band.\n\u2022 The SDMB hub was replaced by the combina-\ntion of a 3GPP Node B and an RNC emula-\ntor. The baseband functions of the SDMB hub\nwere enabled via adaptations of the two pieces\nof UMTS-compliant equipment to enable sup-\nport of MBMS radio bearer services [6] and\nadapt to the MoDiS platform constraints.\n\u2022 Terrestrial repeaters are on-channel; that is,\nthey amplify the satellite signal at the same\nfrequency and using the same scrambling code\nas the signal coming from the hub network\nemulator rather than performing frequency\nconversion and transmission with a different\nscrambling code (frequency conversion\nrepeaters). Two on-channel repeaters, with a\nsignal processing delay of 7 \u00b5s, were used dur-\ning the trials with the MoDiS testbed.\n\u2022 The interactive link is provided by a precom-\nmercial 3G network.\n\u2022 The MoDiS terminal is not an integrated hand-\nset, as envisaged by the SDMB system, but\nmerely an assembly of several pieces of equip-\nment: a prototype SDMB receiver, a laptop, a\n2.5G\/3G handheld device, and a Global Posi-\ntioning System (GPS) receiver. The MoDiS\nterminal was installed in a car.\n\u2022 The MoDiS data server features only a subset\nof the enhanced BM-SC functions required\nfor SDMB operation.\nIn order to accelerate the testbed develop-\nment and validation procedures, the MoDiS\nplatform was split into two distinct (sub)testbeds,\nthe application testbed and the transmission\ntestbed; the former dealing with the integration\nof the network, transport, and application layers,\nand the latter with the radio access layers of the\nMoDiS platform. The respective testbed opera-\ntions are mostly independent of each other, per-\nmitting most of their features to be developed\nand validated separately before deploying the\nfull platform for the trials.\nTRANSMISSION TESTBED\nThe transmission testbed brings together the\nRNC emulator, the Node B and the transmission\nparts of the MoDiS terminal, the prototype\nSDMB receiver being their main entity.\nRNC Emulator and Node B \u2014 The access layer fea-\ntures implemented in the RNC emulator include\nthe radio link control (RLC), medium access\ncontrol (MAC), and packet data compression\nprotocol (PDCP) sublayers as well as limited\nfunctionality of the radio resource control\n(RRC) sublayer. The RLC works in unacknowl-\nedged mode: retransmissions are not feasible,\nand only one service data flow is transmitted at a\ntime over the radio interface, rendering multi-\nplexing and scheduling at the MAC sublayer\nirrelevant. The Node B is driven by the RNC\nsimulator via its standard Iub interface. At the\nreceive side the SDMB receiver and a PC cap-\nture the incoming data. This PC is also used to\nmonitor the transport block error rate (BLER),\nwhich reflects the link quality.\nSDMB Receiver \u2014 The MoDiS prototype SDMB\nreceiver is made of three different blocks: a\nIn order to accelerate\nthe testbed develop-\nment and validation\nprocedures, the\nMoDiS platform was\nsplit into two distinct\n(sub)testbeds, \nthe transmission\ntestbed and the\napplication testbed\nANDRIKOPOULOS LAYOUT  10\/6\/05  12:46 PM  Page 83\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The radio part is used to\ndownconvert the signals of the satellite emulator\nand the terrestrial repeaters from RF (2.1225\nGHz) to 4 MHz in two stages.

The resulting symbol stream is fed into the\nouter modem, which is responsible for the main\nreceive-side functions of the WCDMA physical\nlayer chain [3]: outer (interframe) deinterleav-\ning, rate matching, decoding with a turbo 1\/3\ndecoder or a Viterbi-1\/2 or 1\/3 decoder with\nconstraint length 9, and, finally, transport block\nerror detection based on cyclic redundancy\ncheck (CRC) of 0, 8, 12, 16, or 24 bits.\nAPPLICATION TESTBED\nThe application testbed includes the MoDiS\ndata server and part of the distributed MoDiS\nterminal, the MoDiS terminal application part.\nIt enables the integration and demonstration of\nseveral transport, application, and service-level\nMoDiS features:\n\u2022 Content description: provided generally by the\nproducer of the content using Extended\nMarkup Language (XML) technology. The\nresulting descriptor is known as the content\ndelivery descriptor (CDD).\n\u2022 Content filtering at the server side: The data\nserver classifies the content according to the\nCDD, in order to provide some quality of ser-\nvice (QoS) at the transport layer taking into\naccount the instant resource availability. QoS\nat this layer is provided via exercising schedul-\ning disciplines and buffer management\nschemes on multiple queues, each aggregating\ndata flows with similar service requirements.\n\u2022 Content filtering at the terminal side: Compar-\ning the content identifier list, which is manual-\nly loaded at the SDMB receiver, with the\ncontent identifier of the current transfer\nplaced in the CDD, content is filtered and\nstored at the terminal only when it is likely to\nbe of interest to the user.\n\u2022 Cache management: involves the storage of\ncontent according to priority and user profil-\ning. The user profile is continuously updated\nby analysis of user behavior regarding content\nstored on his\/her terminal. The mechanism\nthat implements this updating mechanism is\ncalled active cache.\nThe tested applications make use of two ser-\nvice delivery modes: streaming, where the con-\ntent is played out at the terminal on the fly\nthrough a small playout buffer, and push-and-\nstore, whereby content is fully stored at the ter-\nminal to be accessed later by the user. Four\ndifferent MoDiS user services (application types)\nmake use of these two service delivery modes:\n\u2022 Push-and-store applications: involve content\nfiltering based on the CDD, terminal type,\nand user profiles\n\u2022 Emergency notifications: make use of the\npush-and-store delivery mode combined with\nprioritization at the data server\n\u2022 Streaming applications: feature direct access\nto content (audio and video mainly) via the\nstreaming delivery mode\n\u2022 Peer-to-peer1 (P2P) or groupcast applications:\nby which mobile users send content through\nthe cellular network to the MoDiS data serv-\ner, which processes it and then pushes it\ntoward other group members via SDMB\nThe application testbed functionality is dis-\ntributed between the MoDiS data server and the\nMoDiS terminal.\nMoDiS Data Server \u2014 The mission of the MoDiS\ndata server is multifold. First, it gathers multi-\nmedia contents from content providers. Then it\npackages these contents, adding content metada-\nta (CDD insertion) that enable the cache man-\nagement function. The server also has to\nschedule the various contents to support the\nSDMB bearer services provided to users. It\nencompasses the server part of the reliable\ntransport layer and the server part of the afore-\nmentioned MoDiS applications. Finally, it\nincludes a routing unit that lets it route traffic\nover the physical connection to the transmission\ntestbed. In terms of discrete modules, the MoDiS\ndata server encompasses the file server, applica-\ntion server, and a third module comprising the\nscheduler and routing unit, whose implementa-\ntion is tightly coupled and constitutes the MoDiS\npush engine server part.\nMoDiS Terminal Application Part \u2014 The MoDiS ter-\nminal application part consists mainly of the\npush client, cache manager, and user applica-\ntion. The push client processes incoming con-\ntent. It first filters the incoming traffic, passing\nthe content of interest to the cache manager for\nfurther processing using an ad hoc protocol.\nOnce the content has been correctly received,\nthe SDMB receiver is turned off. The push client\nalso manages the content identifier list, which\ninvolves functions such as initialization and\nupdates of the list stored at the SDMB receiver,\nfiltering of incoming traffic when the SDMB\nreceiver is turned on, and removal of the content\nidentifier of content that has been correctly\nreceived. Finally, incoming data is deciphered\naccording to prestored keys. The cache manager,\non the other hand, is responsible for the imple-\nmentation of the active cache mechanism. Con-\ntents are filtered on the basis of the continuously\nupdated user interests profile; an auto-adaptive\nprocess allows the user profile to be built strictly\nbased on what the user likes to get and what\nhe\/she is not interested in. This process is fully\nimplicit without requiring any programming\neffort from the user and can cope with dynamic\nchanges of this profile.\nTRIAL DESCRIPTION AND METHODOLOGY\nTRIAL SETUP\nThe field testbed was installed in the area of\nMonte Carlo (Fig. 2.) The position of the satel-\nlite emulator was fixed at one of the highest\npoints of Monaco. The antenna was pointed to\nthe harbor area, where line-of-sight (LOS)\npropagation conditions are not always possible.\nThe first terrestrial repeater was set up close to\nan area where there was no satellite reception\nat all because of high buildings. The buildings\nalso blocked the LOS to the IMR; however,\nreception was good due to reflections onto\nthese buildings that created strong enough mul-\ntipaths. The second repeater was placed on the\nother side of the harbor in an attempt to over-\ncome the problem of bad reception due to the\n1 The use of the term\npeer-to-peer connectivity\nin the context of MoDiS\nimplies the possibility\noffered to individual\nmobile users to become\nthe sources of content that\nis pushed toward the peer\nmembers of their group.\nThe application\ntestbed includes the\nMoDiS data server\nand part of the \ndistributed MoDiS\nterminal, the MoDiS\nterminal application\npart.

The existence of the two repeaters\nalso meant that at those places where the satel-\nlite signal was not blocked by buildings, we\ncould receive and combine both the satellite\nand repeater signals.\nThe power received by the different equip-\nment was set to be equal to the power that would\nhave been received from a real geostationary\nsatellite. The signal reception level at the refer-\nence points and the reference points themselves,\nthe test zones, and the IMR input powers were\ndefined accordingly. The reference point is\nwhere the MoDiS receiver input power level\nfrom the satellite emulator was equal to what\nwould have been received from the real satellite.\nThe test zone was defined as the area where the\nreceived power is \u00b11.5 dB around the power\nreceived at the reference point. Five different\ntest zones were defined, as depicted in Fig. 2. In\nzone 1 there is usually good LOS reception of\nthe satellite signal, whereas the IMR signals are\nblocked or too weak to have great influence on\nthe performance of the receiver. In zone 2 we\nhave a combination of the satellite signal and\nthe signal from an IMR. Reception is good, but\ncan sometimes suffer from blocking. In zone 3,\nthe casino area, the available signals are only\nfaded multipaths coming from one IMR, and\npoor reception is expected. Zone 4, the tunnel,\nis the most difficult, with reception being almost\nimpossible, whereas in zone 5 the reception of\nthe satellite signal is again difficult due to high\nbuildings surrounding the roads in this zone.\nThe repeater placed below zone 5 increases the\ntotal received power by introducing a second sig-\nnal path. Finally, the IMR input power coming\nfrom the satellite emulator is equal to the power\nthat would have been received from the real\nsatellite. The satellite emulator-reference point\nand the satellite emulator-IMR distances were\nequal to 1 km.\nThe SDMB receiver, a monitoring PC, and\nthe application PC were installed in the boot of\na car with built-in screens that were used to\nmonitor the physical part of the receiver and\nexamine the quality of the received data. During\nthe trials, all measurements were logged onto\nthe monitoring PC. Data from the RAKE receiv-\ner, the automatic gain control (AGC) block, and\nBLER measurement data and GPS data were\nsaved for post-processing purposes. From the\nRAKE measurements one could extract the sig-\nnal level per combiner finger, total signal power,\nand noise power, making it also possible to cal-\nculate the ratio Eb\/Nt (energy per bit over total\nnoise, including interference, density ratio). Four\ndifferent transmission modes corresponding to\nfour different WCDMA radio bearers at 12.2,\n64, 128, and 384 kb\/s were tested. The transmit\npower was set in such a way that the received\nantenna power at the reference point was\nbetween \u201385 and \u201395 dBm.\nTRIALS\u2019 SCOPE\nAt a high level, the trials aimed at demonstrating\nthe envisaged SDMB applications and features\nrelevant to service delivery, such as cache man-\nagement, user profile management, and condi-\ntional access. The primary concern in these\nexperiments with streaming applications was to\nassess the possibility of streaming audio\/video\ncontent at rates of 64, 128, and 384 kb\/s. The\noperator schedules a transmission using the\nCDD, usually a Windows Media stream. The\nserver then activates the multicast routing func-\ntion and forwards the stream onto the hub net-\nwork emulator. A session is announced\nn Figure 2.

In\ngroupcast applications, a more advanced service\nparadigm was tested: two users make use of\n2.5G\/3G handsets and send data to the MoDiS\ndata server making use of the point-to-point\nconnection through the 2.5G\/3G network. There\nthe content is processed and pushed to the\nMoDiS terminal using the push-and-store deliv-\nery mechanism. The users are engaged in a loca-\ntion-based collaborative session, where they are\nable to use video messaging and chat, as well as\na location mapping application that allows users\nto be aware of each other\u2019s position.\nTherefore, the trials inevitably focused on a\nseries of issues that have a severe impact on\napplication performance and, eventually, the end\nuser experience of the system.\nSignal Quality \u2014 The quality of the signal is moni-\ntored while the testbed is configured in four dif-\nferent transmission modes. Parameters like data\nrate, spreading length, and transport block size\n(TBS) are different in these modes and cover all\npossible settings of the forward access channel\n(FACH), the WCDMA transport channel used\nfor the support of MBMS radio bearer services.\nMacro-diversity \u2014 Equally important was to ana-\nlyze the propagation conditions in the emulated\nsatellite-IMR environment for different configu-\nrations and evaluate the impact on reception\nperformance using the MoDiS prototype SDMB\nreceiver. The macrodiversity requirements were\nfirst tested in a laboratory environment with a\nchannel simulation tool in a wired setup, where\nthe delays between the different paths can be\nadjusted to known values. The field trials gave a\nchance to repeat the tests in an uncontrollable\nbut realistic wireless environment. The delay\nbetween the paths and the power of each trans-\nmitter were monitored and logged by the RAKE\nVisualizer, a tool with the capability to display\nthe position and strength of each RAKE finger.\nReliable Transport \u2014 The use of reliable transport\nprotocols over SDMB bearers was another\nmechanism to validate. Tools were used for\nmonitoring reception quality at the client side at\nthe terminal. Relevant state machines were\ndeveloped for this purpose. The collected statis-\ntics at each receiver may drive the fine-grained\ntuning of transport layer parameterization, such\nas packet forward error correction (FEC) redun-\ndancy, and interleaving depth.\nOUTCOMES OF THE TRIALS AND\nHINTS FOR THE SYSTEM\nOverall, the complete system performed accord-\ning to our expectations. The transmission perfor-\nmance was good up to 128 kb\/s, whereas for 384\nkb\/s the results were less satisfactory, as depicted\nin Table 1 and Fig. 3. The four types of SDMB\napplications were all successfully demonstrated.\nThe main conclusions derived from the vari-\nous sets of trials are presented below.\nSDMB Receiver and Radio Transmission \u2014 The need\nfor a larger RAKE window and more RAKE fin-\ngers for the SDMB receiver was one of the main\noutcomes of the trials. In general, the RAKE\nwindow size has to be twice the maximum delay\ndifference between the channel resolved paths.\nThe first detected path must be set in the middle\nn Table 1.

The maximum delay differ-\nence during MoDiS trials was 11 \u00b5s, significantly\nhigher than that usually met in T-UMTS cells.\nThe combination of the IMR signals with the\ndirect signal coming from the satellite results in\na multipath signal, with much wider delay spread\nand a higher number of resolvable components\nthan when only terrestrial transmission occurs\n[7]. With the standard RAKE window size of 20\n\u00b5s, this \u201cartificial multipath\u201d due to the exis-\ntence of on-channel IMRs could not be com-\nbined constructively, thus generating additional\ninterference. The receiver performance\nimproved significantly when the RAKE window\nsize was increased to 33 \u00b5s, since this allowed\nmore signal components to be combined, at the\nsame time reducing the interference levels. The\nwider spread of the multipath, and hence the\nneed to increase the RAKE window, was also\ndue to the processing delay of 7 \u00b5s introduced\nby the on-channel repeaters. This problem would\nhave been avoided with frequency conversion\nrepeaters. Notably, all four transmission modes\ntested in the trials featured a transmission time\ninterval (TTI) of 10 ms, limiting the reception\nquality gain to outer (interframe) interleaving.\nThe trials also showed that the use of IMRs\nnot only imposes additional requirements on\nthe SDMB receiver, but also requires their cor-\nrect placement and transmit power setting.\nWhen the IMR power was too high, other sig-\nnals could not come through; when it was too\nlow, on the other hand, it generated extra inter-\nference because the receiver was not able to\nrecombine the signal. Simulations using a radio\nplanning tool were deemed necessary for the\ntestbed deployment and configuration. These\nsimulations took into account the performance\nof the Node B, repeaters, and SDMB receiver,\nas well as the location of the MoDiS equipment\nand the Monaco Telecom UMTS network.\nMore investigation regarding the satellite angle\nmust be done in the future in order to better\nunderstand its impact on coverage, scattering,\nand indoor penetration.\nTransport and Application Layers \u2014 The reliable\ntransport layer implemented for the push-and-\nstore service included packet-level FEC and\ninterleaving. The conditional access mechanism\nwas validated by sending encrypted content over\nthe broadcast link that was decrypted by the user\nwith the correct key.\nThe results in Fig. 4 show that interleaving is\nof utmost importance in coping with data loss of\nup to 100 percent during intervals of complete\nsignal outage on the order of 10 s (e.g., while the\ncar was traversing the well-known Monte Carlo\ntunnel in zone 4). With 20 percent static FEC\nwe were able to compensate for 10 s of complete\nblocking.\nThe trials also confirmed the importance of\npacket-level FEC in compensating for short-term\nerrors. In particular, in fixed situations with\ngood reception, 10 percent FEC can easily com-\npensate for the less than 10 percent BLER that\noccurs sporadically. However, in situations with\nhigh BLER (more than 70\u201380 percent), particu-\nlarly inside tunnels, 10 percent FEC cannot com-\npensate for the errors, and sizing the FEC for\nthis would lead to unrealistic values. In such\nconditions, large storage capacity associated with\ninterleaving and carouseling appear to provide\nhigh added value.\nMore detailed analysis of the trials results is\navailable at [2].\nSDMB POSITIONING WITHIN\nDIGITAL MULTIMEDIA BROADCASTING\nSeveral technologies are being developed by the\nindustry in order to address the emerging mar-\nket of digital multimedia broadcasting.

The SDMB offering allows opera-\ntors to devote network resources to more prof-\nitable interactive services, providing them with\nan additional platform for delivery of broad-\ncast\/multicast services.\nOn the other hand, the digital video broad-\ncasting standard for handheld devices (DVB-\nH) [8]  adds certain features to the DVB\nterrestrial (DVB-T) standard to address the\npower consumption and mobility constraints of\nhandheld terminals. Whereas the standard\nallows the support of higher transmission rates\n(on the order of 10), the use of a different\nradio interface requires the use of an addition-\nal full reception chain on the mobile handheld\nto enable access to both types of services: the\ninteractive ones provided by the mobile cellu-\nlar network and the broadcast\/multicast ones\noffered by DVB-H.\nBetween the two systems, from a capacity\npoint of view, stands the terrestrial DMB (T-\nDMB) alternative, which is a modified version of\nthe terrestrial digital audio broadcasting (T-\nDAB) standard and makes use of OFDM tech-\nnology. The system raises similar concerns as\nDVB-H on the handheld side and is implement-\ned at the very\/ultra high frequency (VHF\/UHF)\nbands, which may delay system deployment until\nthese bands become available from a regulatory\npoint of view.\nThe SDMB system stands as a complemen-\ntary rather than purely competitive alternative to\nthese options, in particular DVB-H. Its main\nadvantage is reduced cost on the network and, in\nparticular, on the handheld terminal side, thanks\nto close integration with the mobile terrestrial\nnetworks, high reuse of technology, and adop-\ntion of the WCDMA radio interface.\nCONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK\nThe MoDiS experimental platform has demon-\nstrated for the first time an innovative service\ndelivery proposal for mobile users, relying on the\nsynergy of mobile satellite and terrestrial net-\nworks. The successful demonstration of repre-\nsentative SDMB applications in a particularly\nchallenging propagation environment reinforced\nthe technical feasibility of the SDMB system\nconcept, while allowing real-world experimenta-\ntion with key system engineering issues.\nThe proof of concept demonstration in the\ncontext of the MoDiS project has been another\nstep for the SDMB system toward the opera-\ntional stage. The described testbed has brought\ntogether many of the findings in earlier R&D\nprojects partially sponsored by the European\nCommission (EC), European Space Agency\n(ESA), and French Space Agency (CNES),\nwhereas system studies are continued within the\nEC 6th Framework Programme (FP6) and ESA\nresearch programs.\nThe main expression of research effort on\nSDMB is currently the EC FP6 project MAE-\nSTRO, which addresses the whole range of\nissues pertinent to SDMB, from system design\nand demonstration to regulation and standard-\nization [9]. With respect to system demonstra-\ntion in particular, MAESTRO aims at\nenhancement of the MoDiS testbed, replacing\nthe MoDiS data server with a representative\nSDMB-enhanced BM-SC, and the distributed\nMoDiS terminal with an SDMB-enhanced 3G\nhandset. These additions will lead to a platform\nmuch closer to the envisaged commercial SDMB\nsystem and enable real-world experimentation\nwith more design trade-offs, particularly on the\nuser terminal side, many of which have been\nmade clear during the MoDiS trials.\nREFERENCES\n[1] N.
