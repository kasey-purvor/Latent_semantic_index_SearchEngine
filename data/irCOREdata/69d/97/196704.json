INTRODUCTION \nSPACE charge accumulation is known to play a very \nimportant role in the aging and breakdown of HVDC \nsolid polymeric insulation, due to local electric field \nenhancement. If the applied field exceeds the threshold \nfor space charge accumulation, charge injected from the \nelectrodes can accumulate in traps located at the interface \nwith electrodes and in the insulation bulk [1-4]. Buildup \nof injected charge can be observed often close to the \ninjecting electrode, forming a homocharge distribution \nafter relatively short times of voltage application, \ndepending on electric field and temperature. At other \ntimes, heterocharge is seen to accumulate close to \nelectrodes. Models based on charge injection via a \nSchottky barrier, transport via either two levels of traps or \na continuous exponential trap distribution, and presence \nor absence of an extraction barrier are able to reproduce \nmany of the main features of space charge and conduction \ncurrent that have been observed, though the details cannot \nyet be fully simulated [5-9]. \nCharge packets are another feature associated with \ncharge injection and transport which has been observed in \nsolid polymeric insulation. They are activated generally \nby high DC fields, with inception values depending on \nmaterial (lowered by the presence of contaminants), \ntemperature and mechanical stress [10-14]. They have \ntypically mobility in the range 10\n-14\n to 10\n-12\n m\n2\nV\n-1\ns\n-1\n, and \nfor this reason they are named in the following as \u2015slow\u2016 \npackets. Charge packets constitute an important ageing \nfactor, concerning DC electrical stress, due to large \nmagnification of the electrical field inside the insulation \nassociated with packet movement. It has been observed, \nin fact, that such packets can cause accelerated \nbreakdown of insulation [15,16], particularly when they \nare associated with a continual charge accumulation [17]. \nVarious theories have been proposed to explain the \ngeneration of slow packets, from hysteresis of the field-\ndependence of the injection current, or fluctuations in the \ncurrent injected from electrodes, to field-induced \nionization of impurities or neutral sites [15, 18-21]. Only \none of these theories has reached the stage of a successful \nsimulation [21], where the creation and transport of large \nslow negative packets was described by assuming field \nionization in a three-level system comprising an ionizable \nstate, trap state, and valence band. In this case a plane of \nnegative ionization is transferred through the system as \nmobile holes released by the high field at the front of the \nplane move in the opposite direction to the plane and \nrecombine with the ionized states at the rear of the plane. \nSimulations of the model for space charge accumulation \ndescribed in [8] also gave a single charge packet \noccasionally that was related to fluctuations in the \ninjection process. However, none of these theories or \nsimulations is able to describe the large generality of \ncases of slow charge packets. The common point is that a \nvery high electrical field is needed to activate the packets. \nThe type of charge carriers, the field distribution at the \npacket edges, the effect of electrodes, contaminants, and \ntemperature are still open to different and contrasting \ninterpretations. \nA point that has not been observed or commented upon \nyet, mainly because the measurement systems for space \ncharge detection are not fast enough, is that heterocharge \nformation, which seems often the start up of slow packets, \nmay occur very rapidly, i.e. fraction of a second or a few \nseconds. This is the case of space charge measurements \nperformed on HV model cables discussed in this paper. A \nsignificant accumulation of heterocharge close to both \nelectrodes (semicon layers) was observed from several \ntests carried out in different laboratories involved in the \nEuropean project HVDC [9, 22]. More accurate and fast \nmeasurements show that such charge forms just a few \nseconds or fraction of seconds after voltage application.  \nThis rapid appearance of heterocharge might be explained \nthrough the separation of ionic species, e.g. due to the \npresence of contaminants and\/or crosslinking by-products \nin the insulation bulk. However, as shown in [23], \nheterocharge accumulation could be associated also with \ninjection, when the rate of charge trapping is low \ncompared to the transit time of the charge and extraction \nis slow compared to the rate of arrival of charge (i.e., in \nthe presence of an extraction barrier). In this case a \nheterocharge region would build up at the counter \nelectrode, with a width that increases with time but \nwithout any observable charge in the bulk of the material \n[23]. In order to understand the nature and dynamics of \nthis fast-accumulating heterocharge, investigations have \nbeen performed by carrying out space charge tests using \nan ultra fast acquisition system. The results of such \ninvestigation are reported in the following. \n2. TEST PROCEDURES \nThe specimens considered in this paper consist of cable \nmodels reproducing HV cables on a reduced-scale (mini-\ncables), made by three layers: inner semicon (0.7 mm \nthick), insulation layer of XLPE material (1.5 mm thick) \nand outer semicon (0.15 mm thick). The conductor \ndiameter is 2.8 mm (Fig. 1). \n \n \nconductor \nXLPE \nSemicon layer \n \nFigure 1. Sketch of tested minicable. Conductor diameter = 2.8 mm; \nInner semicon thickness = 0.7 mm; dielectric (XLPE) thickness = 1.5 \nmm. Outer semicon = 0.15  mm. \nSpecimens were thermally treated for 5 days at 80 \u00b0C in \norder to expel most of the cross-linking by-products and \ncontaminants. Space charge measurements were carried \nout through the Pulsed Electro Acoustic (PEA) technique \nat field values exceeding the threshold for space charge \naccumulation, i.e., 60 kV, which corresponds to a mean \nfield of about 40 kV\/mm (the threshold is around 10 \nkV\/mm at 25 \u00b0C). The poling time was set in two ways. \nTests were performed in order that charge could reach the \nsteady-state condition (usually 10000 s are enough). \nOther tests, mostly addressed to detecting and \nunderstanding fast space charge formation phenomena, \nwere lasting less than 100 s since attention was paid to the \ncharge dynamics in the first few seconds of polarization. \nThe effect of temperature on charge dynamics was \ninvestigated by carrying out tests in an oven under \nisothermal conditions (no temperature gradient applied to \ninsulation) at 35 \u00b0C, 45 \u00b0C and 70 \u00b0C.  \nIn order to record space charge profiles at times as \nclose together as possible, e.g. every 10-100 ms, with \nminimum noise, an average on at least 100 signals was \nperformed. A Digital Signal Averager was used for this \npurpose. This device, in fact, thanks to its performing \nprocessor and a fast connection to the PC, is able to \nacquire, average, and store signals at a rate that can reach \nsome MHz, thus enabling the fastest acquisition of space \ncharge profiles.  Space charge profiles can be thus \ndisplayed every 0.05 s, with each profile an average of \n100 acquired PEA signals. \n3. TEST RESULTS \nSpace charge patterns obtained from PEA tests on mini-\ncables using a standard acquisition system are reported in \nFigs. 2 and 3. Tests are relevant to measurements at a \npoling voltage of 60 kV applied for 10000 s \n(depolarization of 3600 s), at a temperature of 25 \u00b0C (Fig. \n2A and 3A, B) and 70 \u00b0C (Fig. 2B), carried out on XLPE \nmini-cables [9, 22]. The difference between the two \nfigures is in the materials. While the one of Fig. 2 is the \nreference  for high voltage cables, the XLPE of Fig. 3 is \nmanufactured mostly for MV cables, untreated (Fig. 3B) \nor thermally treated for 5 days at 80 \u00b0C (Fig. 3A).   \n As can be seen, heterocharge builds up close to both \nelectrodes, particularly at high temperature, almost \nimmediately at the beginning of polarization. At room \ntemperature, and, particularly, in the untreated MV-grade \nmaterial, slow packets of negative\/positive charge can be \nobserved moving across the insulation bulk. We must \nremember that the PEA signal is sensitive to the net \ncharge at each point of the insulation bulk. Hence, if \npositive and negative charge packets having similar \namplitude and injected simultaneously from both \nelectrodes overlap at a given point, the detected PEA \nprofile could show up as if no charge was accumulated at \nthat particular point. It can be easily understood that this \nproblem makes the interpretation of the space charge \nprofiles detected from measurements more complicated. \nIn particular, the separation of positive and negative \ncharge packet contributions could be very difficult. \nThe dynamic of charge packets can be inferred by \nmeans of the results of PEA measurements performed on \nthe same XLPE mini-cables using the fast acquisition \nsystem described in the previous Section. These \nmeasurements yield space charge profiles such as those \nreported in Figures 4 and 5. The absolute time, i.e., the \ntime relevant to the acquisition from the beginning of the \npolarization, is indicated on the bottom of each profile.  \nFigure 4 shows charge profiles obtained at 35 \u00b0C under \na poling voltage of 60 kV, at different poling times (from \n0 to 0.9 s). As can be seen, at the beginning of \npolarization no space charge is evident (Fig. 4A). After \n0.1 s a small packet of positive charge seems to be \ninjected from the anode (circled in Fig. 4B). This charge \nmoves, then, following the direction indicated by the \narrow. At time t=0.3 s it is located around the middle of \nthe insulation bulk (see Fig. 4C) and reaches the counter \nelectrode at t=0.5 s (see Fig. 4D). An example of a \nnegative charge packet crossing the insulation bulk is \nreported in Figs. 4E-H. In this case the negative charge, \nindicated by a circle, moves from cathode to anode in \nabout 0.3 s. A simultaneous transit of positive and \nnegative packets has been often observed in space charge \nprofiles. For the sake of clarity here we chose profiles \nshowing separately positive and negative packets.  \nThe charge packets detected in these profiles are quite \nsmall and difficult to separate from the background. In \norder to show them more clearly, first we have subtracted \nthe profile obtained at the beginning of the experiment \nwhere no space charge exists. Then the profiles were \nprocessed by means of the Stationary Wavelet Transform \n(SWT) to reduce the background noise. The results are \ngiven in Fig. 5, for the positive (Fig. 5A) and negative \n(Fig. 5B) charge packets. They show more clearly the \nexistence of small positive and negative packets crossing \nthe insulation. Increasing the temperature to 45 \u00b0C, \npositive and negative packets are seen that are faster than \nat 35 \u00b0C. They cross the insulation thickness in 0.3 s for \nthe positive packets and 0.2 s for the negative ones. The \neffect is strengthened at 70 \u00b0C, where the positive charge \ncrosses the insulation in 0.15 s and the negative in less \nthen 0.05 s. \n  \n \n \n \n \nA \nB \nCATHODE \nANODE \nCATHODE \nANODE \nNEGATIVE \nCHARGE \nPOSITIVE \nCHARGE \nNEGATIVE \nCHARGE \nPOSITIVE \nCHARGE \n10000 0 Time [s]  \nFigure 2.

These \nfeatures will be discussed in the subsequent Sections. \n4. DISCUSSION \n4.1 EVIDENCE FOR FAST CHARGE PACKETS \nFirst of all, it must be pointed out that each charge \npacket (positive and negative) travelling from one \nelectrode to the other involves only a small amount of \ncharge (about 100-130 pC with a charge density of 0.07-\n0.1 C\/m\n3\n). However the packets are produced with a high \nrepetition rate and therefore after some seconds from the \nbeginning of polarization, several packets accumulate a \nnoticeable amount of heterocharge close to both \nelectrodes. This heterocharge buildup has been observed \nin our experiments only when a semiconducting layer is \npresent between insulation and metal (copper or \naluminium) electrode and for relatively-thick specimens. \nTests performed on thin flat specimens having semicon \nlayer only on one side showed, in fact, that no \nheterocharge was observed close to the electrode not in \ncontact with the semicon [22]. It seems that semicon \nmaterial can partially block the extraction of injected \ncharge at the counter electrode. Thus, a heterocharge \nbuild-up may be observed close to the partially-blocking \nelectrode [9, 22]. If we assume that the extraction rate is  \nproportional to the amount of heterocharge present (at \nleast until space charge accumulation in the bulk is \nnegligible) and that heterocharge accumulates because the \nrate of arrival of charge packets is initially greater than \nthe rate of extraction, we obtain the following expression \nfor the time-dependence of the heterocharge, Qhet(t), \n))exp(1()( kt\nk\nFQ\ntQ\npak\nhet\n   (1) \nHere Qhet(t) is the total heterocharge per square metre, \nQpak is the charge per square metre in a packet, F is the \npacket repetition rate, and k is the extraction rate constant. \nSince we measure Qpak and F independently of the \nheterocharge formation, equation (1) is completely \ndefined if the saturation heterocharge quantity is known \n(i.e. QpakF\/k=Qhet(\u221e)). A fit to the time dependence \ntherefore gives an independent check to the value of the \nrate constant k and provides support to the identification \nof the features shown in Figures 4 and 5 as charge \npackets. Figure 6 shows the results of such a fit for \npositive (Fig. 6A) and negative packets (Fig. 6B). The \nvalues of the parameters (average of 10 packets) of eq. (1) \nare: F=2.5 s\n-1\n, k= 0.0625 s\n-1\n, Qpak=1\u00d710\n-5 \nC\/m\n2\n, for \nnegative packets,  F= 3.3 s\n-1\n, k=0.0825 s\n-1\n, Qpak=2\u00d710\n-5\n \nC\/m\n2\n, for positive packets. It can be seen that apart from a \nsmall displacement of the origin of the heterocharge \nbuildup from t=0, the fit is very good.  \nQ\nmean\npositive heterocharge ins1 sc1 60kV 70\u00b0C\nTime [s]\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nQ\nh\ne\nt \n[C\n\/m\n2\n]\n0\n2e-4\n4e-4\n6e-4\n8e-4\n1e-3\nExperimental data\nEquation (1)\n \nA \n \ntime [s]\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nQ\nh\ne\nt \n[C\n\/m\n2\n]\n0\n1e-4\n2e-4\n3e-4\n4e-4\n5e-4\nExperimental data\nEquation (1)\n \nB \nFigure 6. Positive (A) and negative (B) heterocharge build-up as a \nfunction of poling time from experimental data (thick line) and \ncalculated by equation (1) (dashed line). \nAnother interesting piece of information one can get \nfrom the previous space charge profiles is that the time \nfor the charge to cross the insulation bulk is very small, \ni.e., a fraction of a second, decreasing with increasing \ntemperature. This could seem surprising for an insulating \nmaterial having low conductivity such as XLPE.  \nHowever, the energy of injected charge is large enough, \nconsidering the quite thin insulation (1.5 mm thick), to  \nenable charge to reach the counter electrode in a very \nshort time. It is noteworthy that the negative charge \nseems to be always faster than the positive charge at the \nsame temperature. In order to provide a quantification of \nthe charge dynamics, the average mobility value, \u03bc, of the \ncharge packets (positive and negative) can be obtained \nroughly from [24, 25]:  \nmeanE\nv\n     (2)  \nwhere v is the speed of the charge packet; Emean is the \naverage electric field applied to the insulation (in this case \n= 40 kV\/mm). Such a procedure was justified in [18] for \nslow charge packets where it was pointed out that the \npacket speed did not change with changes in field \ngenerated at the packet front, either as the packet crossed \nthe insulation or in a packet sequence generated under the \nsame applied field. The values of average mobility \ncalculated according to eq. (2) are reported in Table 1. \nThese values are at least 2-3 orders of magnitude larger \nthan the typical values of apparent-trap-controlled \nmobility coming from slow packets (typically10\n-12\n-10\n-14 \nm\n2\n\/Vs) [8, 26]. Even using the local field in (2) the value \nof mobility is still very high. The average mobility of the \nfast packets increases with temperature, i.e. about 3 and 6 \ntimes larger on doubling the temperature (in \u00baC), for \npositive and negative charge packets, respectively. The \nmobility of negative charge is, thus, significantly larger \nthan that relevant to positive charge, especially at high \ntemperature (about 3 times larger at 70 \u00b0C).  \n \nTable 1. Average mobility values at three different temperatures for \npositive and negative fast charge packets. \n \n \nMobility [m 2 \/Vs]  \n35 \u00b0C 45 \u00b0C 70 \u00b0C \nPositive charge 7.2 10\n-11\n 9.6 10\n-11\n 1.9 10\n-10\n \nNegative charge 9.6 10\n-11\n  1.4 10\n-10\n  5.7 10\n-10\n  \n \nThe mobility of slow charge packets has been estimated \nfrom data at a single temperature to have large activation \nenergies of the order of 1 eV or more [27]. Measurement \nof the temperature-dependence of the transit time of slow \npackets [18] in XLPE material of the same origin as that \nused here yields an activation energy of 1.2 eV for the \nmobility of positive packets, see Fig. 7. In order to \ndetermine whether the high mobility of the fast packets is \nassociated with a substantially lower activation energy the \nmobility (log-values) reported in Table 1 are plotted as a \nfunction of    T\n-1\n (T = absolute temperature) according to \nthe Arrhenius law (see Figures 8A and 8B for positive \nand negative charge packet mobility, respectively). The \nactivation energy, Ea, is then calculated from the slope of \nthe regression line: the larger the activation energy, the \nstronger the effect of temperature in increasing the \nmobility. \nAs can be seen from Fig. 8 the experimental data fit a \nstraight line, meaning that the charge transport process \nfollows the Arrhenius law, thus, providing a further \nconfirmation that the charge packets highlighted here are \nreal charges and not perturbations of the detected PEA \nsignal due to noise. Moreover, the activation energy of \nnegative charge is about 2 times larger than that relevant \nto positive charge, meaning that the dynamics of negative \ncharges is much more affected by temperature than that \nrelevant to positive charges.  Furthermore the activation \nenergies of both positive and negative fast packets are \nmuch lower than those appropriate to the slow packets, \nindicating that their high speed owes something to their \nlow activation energies for transport. \n \nArrhenius Plot of Transit Time\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n3.05 3.15 3.25 3.35 3.45\n1000\/T\nL\nn\n[t\nra\nn\ns\nit\n t\nim\ne\n i\nn\n s\ne\nc\no\nn\nd\ns\n]\nSeries1\nSeries2\n \nFigure 7.

Simulations using an exponential trap \nenergy distribution, [8], were able to reproduce  features \nof the low-field charge distribution in similar XLPE \npeelings at 298 K with a charge mobility that goes from \n10\n-14\n to 10\n-13\n m\n2\nV\n-1\ns\n-1\n, and up to 10\n-12\n or higher for \nelectrical fields larger than 50 kV\/mm, see Fig. 9. A \ncomparison with the data of Table 1 and the mobility of \nthe slow packets of Fig. 3, shows that the packets \noccasionally formed  in the simulations of the model \npresented in [8] are of the slow type. Therefore, it seems \nthat even when the trap depth range is extended to small \nvalues using the exponential distribution it is unable to \nreproduce the situation needed for the high mobility of \nfast charge packets. Although the simulations reported in \n[23] do not produce charge packets, they do define the \nconditions required for fast transit of the insulation \nsample and the accumulation of heterocharge. These are \nthat: a) charge is injected into a state in which the charge \nhas high mobility and, therefore, a small activation \nenergy for transport, b) a very low or non-existent \nprobability of trapping in deep traps, and c) a rate of \ncharge extraction that is initially smaller than that of \ncharge arrival in the vicinity of the extracting electrode. It \ncan be seen that this picture is consistent with the \nmeasurements reported here, if features of the injection \nprocess cause the charge injection to take the form of \npulses with the charge entering the high mobility state in \nlow applied fields and the low mobility deep-trapped state \nin high fields. The constancy of the charge packet \namplitude as it crosses the insulation implies that for fast \npackets the trapping rate and, hence, the establishment of \na thermodynamic equilibrium distribution between the \nconcentration of charges in the deep traps and in the \nshallow-trap high-mobility state, is very much slower \nthan the time over which the experiment takes place. A \nlack of interchange between the deep-trap states and the \nhigh-mobility states is also required for the existence of \nslow charge packets, since in this case one would expect \nthe high applied field to promote a considerable portion \nof the injected charge into the shallower states, which \nwould reduce the packet amplitude in a way that is not \nobserved. This inability to transfer charge between the \ntwo classes of states indicates that the association of deep \ntraps with chemical contaminants and shallow traps with \nphysical traps [29, 30] is probably over-simplistic, and it \nis noteworthy that the activation energy for the mobility \nof fast negative packets is twice that estimated for \nphysical electron traps.  \nAn exciting interpretation of the results relevant to fast \npackets can be driven considering that they involve likely \nelectronic carriers. The negative packets, in fact, could \nconsist of electrons moving in the interchain space \n(remembering the negative electron affinity of PE [31]) \nthanks to chain relaxation mechanism which contributes \nto charge motion. The positive packets could be likely \nformed by holes, easily moving along the chains and \ntunnelling from one chain to another, again thanks to \nchain motion. This picture would explain, in fact, the \ndifferent mobility detected experimentally in positive and \nnegative packets and why the associated charge does not \nseem to recombine in the bulk (positive and negative \ncharges follow different paths). Moreover, if the packet \nmovement is due to chain relaxation, charge hopping \nthrough a quasi-continuous distribution of localized states \nseems not to apply to the movement of fast packets and \nthis justifies the very narrow trapping level for positive \n(0.25 eV) and negative (0.48 eV) charges. Anyway, the \nnature of charge transport in packets as well as the reason \nwhy packets remain as packets and do not spread out, \nparticularly in the case of the slow packets whose transit \nmay take hours even in thin 150 m samples, requires a \ndetailed analysis of the transport mechanism that will be \nreported in a subsequent paper. What does seem clear is \nthat the explanation of charge packets as the \nmanifestation of a peak in the dependence of the charge \ncarrier speed as a function of increasing electric field, \n[15], cannot be accepted as the packet does not slow \ndown when the field at the packet front increases, either \nduring transit of the sample or in a packet sequence \n[10,18]. Nor do the packets speed up when the packet-\nfront field diminishes in a slow charge packet sequence.  \n \nFigure 9. Electron and hole mobility as a function of electric field for \ntwo sets of parameters (II.1 and II.2) from the mobility model discussed \nin [8]. The associated data are taken from [8]. \n \nThe conditions at the interface with the injecting \nelectrode clearly play a role in causing injection to take \nthe form of pulses leading to charge transit as a packet, \nand the interface field must also be influential in \ncontrolling the type of state into which the injection is \nmade. These considerations imply that different electrode \nmaterials may behave differently. They also suggest that \nthe way that various chemical species facilitate charge \npacket formation is via their influence upon interface \nstates and the interface morphology. It has been shown \n[10] that the inception of slow charge packets requires the \ninterface field to exceed a threshold value. This field is \nhigh enough (150 kV\/mm in [10]) to allow the possibility \nof such a massive charge injection that the interface field \nis reduced to a value below the threshold level. It could \nbe speculated that depending on applied voltage and field, \nand for insulation thicknesses large enough to force \ncharge carriers to be subjected to multiple \ntrapping\/detrapping processes, fast packets are needed to \nbring enough heterocharge to the counter-electrode such \nas to magnify the interface field to the required value. \nThis does not seem to be the case in [10] where a region \nof negative homo-charge takes several hours to spread \nacross the sample and provide the hetero-charge field \nenhancement required to initiate positive packets from the \nanode. However it may occur in other cases.  If the \napplied field\/temperature is large enough, or \ncontamination is noticeable (Fig. 3), the interface field \ncan generate directly a slow packet, without needing fast \npackets to accumulate heterocharge. Fast packets may \nstill exist, but it is very difficult to observe them due to \nthe small amount of charge associated with them. It \nshould be pointed out that we would not expect fast \ncharge packets to contribute significantly to the measured \nconductivity because they carry such small amounts of \ncharge and the conductivity is usually measured from the \ncurrent in the quasi-steady state after many hours of \npolarization. They or their associated high-mobility states \nmay however be involved in charge re-distribution \nproduced by thermal gradients in low field [32]. \n5.  CONCLUSIONS \n   The results presented in this paper provide a novel \nexplanation of the very rapid heterocharge formation \nwhich is often observed in HVDC cables and cable \nmodels. Instead of the separation of ionic species under \nthe action of an electric field, usually adopted to explain \nsuch behaviour, experimental tests carried out at high \nsampling rate show that in a fraction of a second charge \npackets are injected at the electrodes and cross the \ninsulation, showing a mobility considerably higher than \nthat expected according to literature and derived from \nconduction current or conventional space charge \nmeasurements. These charge packets are small in \nmagnitude and are generated at fields well below those \ntypically needed for slow packet generation. The mobility \nof the fast charge packets may be orders of magnitude \nlarger than those of the slow packets, which may in some \npart be ascribed to the much lower activation energies of \nthe fast packets. Both positive and negative fast packets \nare observed, with different activation energies and \nrepetition frequencies. Hetero-charge is accumulated \nbecause semicon counter electrodes are initially unable to \nextract charge at the rate at which it arrives in their \nvicinity. A dynamic equilibrium is eventually set up in a \ntime depending upon the extraction rate constant, and \nwith a saturation charge quantity that is dependent upon \nthe charge packet magnitude and repetition frequency as \nwell as the extraction rate constant. The quantity of \nheterocharge is different for positive and negative \npolarities. Our results imply that there are two modes of \ncharge transport, one operative in fast packets and one in \nslow packets, and that these transport modes only inter-\nchange charge very slowly if at all. This research \nconfirms that investigation of fast space charge-\nassociated processes in polymeric insulation is an \napproach that must be promoted to understand better the \nmechanisms of space charge formation. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nPart of the research discussed in this paper was \nperformed within the European Project (of the 5\nth\n \nFramework-program) HVDC, \u2015Benefits of HVDC Links \nin the European Power Electrical System and Improved \nHVDC Technology\u2016 (Contract No. ENK6-CT-2002-\n00670).
