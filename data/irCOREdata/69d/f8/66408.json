The origin of these particles remains uncertain. \nAlthough it is generally accepted that the only sources capable of supplying the energy \nrequired to accelerate the bulk of Galactic cosmic rays are supernova explosions, and even \nthough the mechanism of particle acceleration in expanding supernova remnant (SNR) shocks \nis thought to be well understood theoretically2,3, unequivocal evidence for the production of \nhigh-energy particles in supernova shells has proven remarkably hard to find. Here we report \non observations of the SNR RX J1713.7\u22123946 (G347.3\u22120.5), which was discovered by \nROSAT4 in the X-ray spectrum and later claimed as a source of high-energy \u03b3-rays5,6 of TeV \nenergies (1 TeV=1012 eV). We present a TeV  \u03b3-ray image of the SNR: the spatially resolved \nremnant has a shell morphology similar to that seen in X-rays, which demonstrates that very-\nhigh-energy particles are accelerated there. The energy spectrum indicates efficient \nacceleration of charged particles to energies beyond 100 TeV, consistent with current ideas of \nparticle acceleration in young SNR shocks. \nRX J1713.7\u22123946, together with several other southern hemisphere SNRs, is a prime target \nfor observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), a new system of four \nimaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes located in the Khomas Highland of Namibia. \nH.E.S.S.7,8 (we note that V. F. Hess discovered cosmic rays) exploits the most effective detection \ntechnique for very-high-energy \u03b3-rays, namely, the imaging of Cherenkov light from air showers. \nThis technique, which was pioneered by the Whipple collaboration9, makes use of the fact that \nwhenever a high-energy \u03b3-ray hits the Earth\u2019s atmosphere it is absorbed and initiates a cascade of \ninteractions with air atoms, leading to the formation of a shower of secondary charged particles. \nThose travelling faster than the local speed of light in air emit Cherenkov radiation, which results in \na brief flash of blue Cherenkov light detectable at ground level. By using a telescope with sufficient \nmirror area to collect enough of the faint light signal, and a fast camera with fine pixelation, one can \nimage the shower and reconstruct from this image the direction and energy of the primary \u03b3-ray. \n  \nCombined with the approach of stereoscopic imaging of the cascade using a system of telescopes, \nas pioneered by the HEGRA collaboration10, this yields a very powerful technique for imaging and \nobtaining energy spectra of astronomical sources at TeV energies.  \nThe H.E.S.S. experiment is such a stereoscopic system that consists of four 13-m-diameter \ntelescopes11 spaced at the corners of a square of side 120 m, each equipped with a 960-phototube \ncamera12 covering a large field of view of diameter 5\u00b0. Construction of the telescope system started \nin 2001; the full array was completed in December 2003 with the commissioning of the fourth \ntelescope. HESS has an angular resolution of a few arc minutes, an effective energy range from \n100 GeV to 10 TeV with energy resolution of 15\u201320% and a flux sensitivity approaching \n10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. These characteristics, together with its southern hemisphere location, make \nHESS ideally suited for spectroscopic and morphological studies of Galactic plane sources such as \nRX J1713.7\u22123946, which is now the first SNR shell to be confirmed as a TeV source. TeV \nemission has also been reported from the remnant of SN 100613, a result which our observations \nhave not yet allowed us to confirm with H.E.S.S.14, and from Cassiopeia A15,16 (a classical core-\ncollapse SNR and the weakest TeV source yet reported) whose northern location makes it \ninaccessible to H.E.S.S.. \nHere we present results from observations of RX J1713.7\u22123946 performed between May \nand August 2003 during two phases of the construction and commissioning of HESS. In the first \nphase, two telescopes were operated independently, with stereoscopic event selection done offline \nusing GPS time stamps to identify coincident events. During the second phase, also using two \ntelescopes, coincident events were selected in hardware using an array level trigger. The total on-\nsource observation time was 26 h; after run selection and dead time correction a data set \ncorresponding to 18.1 live hours was used in this analysis. At the trigger level (for observation \naltitude angles of 60\u201375\u00b0), the energy thresholds for the two configurations were 250 GeV (without \nthe array level trigger) and 150 GeV (with the array level trigger). In this analysis, hard cuts were \nused to select only well reconstructed showers. This primarily served to drastically reduce the \nnumber of background cosmic-ray events, but it also homogenized these data taken with the two \ndifferent configurations and improved the angular resolution. Thereby systematic errors are greatly \nreduced at the expense of a higher energy threshold (\u223c800 GeV for the combined data set). \nFigure 1shows the resulting count map centred on RX J1713.7\u22123946. The SNR stands out \nfrom the residual charged cosmic-ray background with a significance of 20 standard deviations. The \noverall shell structure is clearly visible and coincides closely with that seen in X-rays (see Fig. 2). \nTo our knowledge, this is the first case where the identification of an active, that is accelerating, \ncelestial \u03b3-ray source (as opposed to a passive cloud or density enhancement, merely penetrated by \nenergetic particles which are accelerated elsewhere) can be based, not just on a positional \ncoincidence, but on the image morphology. The overall flux above 1 TeV is (1.46 \u00b1 0.17 \n(statistical) \u00b1 0.37 (systematic)) \u00d7 10\u22127 photons m\u22122 s\u22121, which corresponds to 66% of the Crab \nnebula flux as measured by H.E.S.S.. More elaborate analyses of these data using different \n  \nbackground models (needed to determine the spectrum) and independent (and different) analysis \nchains confirm the results presented here. \nThe energy spectrum of the whole remnant is shown in Fig. 3. These data are well described \nby a power law (see Fig. 3 legend) with a photon index \u0393 = 2.19 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b1 0.15, as compared to the \nphoton index of 2.84 \u00b1 0.15 \u00b1 0.20 reported by the CANGAROO-II collaboration for the northwest \npart of the SNR6. The integral energy flux between 1 TeV and 10 TeV is estimated to be \n3.5\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the non-thermal X-ray flux. \nMore data will be taken with the full H.E.S.S. array in 2004. The increased sensitivity (four instead \nof two telescopes) will enable spatially resolved spectral studies. \nRX J1713.7\u22123946 (situated in the Galactic plane, in the constellation Scorpius) is one of the \nbrighter Galactic X-ray SNRs17, with a flux density of a few times 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. In X-rays, it \nexhibits typical shell morphology, but remarkably the X-ray spectrum is completely dominated by a \nnon-thermal continuum with no detectable line emission. The most plausible origin of these X-rays \nis the synchrotron radiation of 100-TeV electrons18,19. However, because alternative explanations \nare not absolutely ruled out20, only the detection of TeV emission from this SNR will provide \nunambiguous evidence for acceleration of particles to multi-TeV energies. Another important point \nis that the TeV signal may contain a component due to accelerated protons interacting with the \nambient gas, as has been predicted theoretically2,3. The contribution of this component should be \nsignificantly enhanced when the supernova shell overtakes nearby dense molecular clouds21, as \nseems to be the case for this object. The CO data22 suggest that a cloud is interacting with the \nnorthwestern part of the SNR, where a striking spatial coincidence between the CO density peaks \nand the regions of peak X-ray emission is seen. The X-ray data23 also indicate significant absorption \ncolumn densities in the western part of the remnant, at values about twice those to the east. These \nindications fit qualitatively with the \u03b3-ray image presented here, where TeV emission is seen from \nthe whole SNR shell but with an increased flux from the northwestern side. \nGiven the recent estimates22\u201324 of the distance to the source of 1 kpc, if a significant part of \nthe TeV flux were to be formed by interactions of cosmic-ray nuclei with gas atoms in the cloud \nwith density n exceeding 100 cm\u22123, the energetics implied by the \u03b3-ray flux and the spectrum would \nbe a few times 1049 n\u22121 erg between 10 and 100 TeV. This is consistent with the picture of an SNR \norigin of Galactic cosmic rays involving about 10% efficiency for conversion of the mechanical \nenergy of the explosion into non-thermal particles, and a production spectrum in the SNR which is \napproximately an E\u22122 power law from several GeV to about one PeV. Moreover, the \u03b3-ray \nmorphology is qualitatively what one would expect from particles accelerated at the shock \ninteracting and radiating in the compressed post-shock region. The extension of the \u03b3-ray spectrum \nup to energies of 10 TeV (see Fig. 3) requires an extremely effective accelerator boosting particles \nup to energies of at least 100 TeV. RX J1713.7\u22123946 is a complex object interacting with \nmolecular clouds of different densities where the TeV emission might emerge from various \nprocesses. Without doubt there will be a contribution from energetic electrons through the inverse \nCompton process, especially from low-density regions (as in the eastern part) of the SNR. At the \n  \nelevated densities likely to exist in the northwestern rim, \u03c00-decays following proton\u2013proton \ninteractions, but also non-thermal Bremsstrahlung of electrons, could make significant \ncontributions. Although disentangling the relative contributions of the various processes is difficult, \nit should be possible through spatially resolved multi-wavelength studies\u2014which will be \nundertaken using the full H.E.S.S. array.  \nThe multi-TeV image of a shell-type SNR presented here constitutes a significant step \nforward towards a solution of the long-standing puzzle of the origin of Galactic cosmic rays, as well \nas demonstrating an astronomical imaging technique operating at photon energies some 12 decades \nhigher than those of visible light. \n \n1.

The flux above 1 TeV from the northern (N) rim is (3.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 \n10\u22128 photons m\u22122 s\u22121, from the western (W) rim (4.1 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 10\u22128 photons m\u22122 s\u22121, from the \nsoutheastern (SE) rim (5.9 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10\u22128 photons m\u22122 s\u22121 and the flux from the interior (I) (1.7 \u00b1 0.6) \n\u00d7 10\u22128 photons m\u22122 s\u22121. The mean \u03b3-ray brightnesses per unit solid angle (that is, the flux values \nnormalized to the area) of the regions are in the ratio 1:1.4:1:1.2 (N:W:SE:I). These values might \n  \ncontradict the visual impression that the northwestern shell of the SNR is brighter. However, \nstatistics of the data sample are limited, and the different areas were chosen for geometric reasons. \nLooking at the image, we see for example that dim regions are included in the seemingly brighter \nnorthern and western area, whereas the interior might gain from leakages from the northwestern \nshell. More detailed spatially resolved flux studies will have to await the advent of new data taken \nwith the full H.E.S.S. array with increased sensitivity. The 70% containment radius of the \u03b3-ray \npoint-spread function (PSF) for this data set with an energy threshold of 800 GeV is illustrated in \nthe bottom left-hand corner (structures that are smaller than this circle should not be considered as \nreal). The image is smoothed with a Gaussian of standard deviation 3 arcmin (matched to the \nangular resolution of the instrument for this particular data set). The linear color scale is in units of \ncounts. Note that the efficiency of the camera falls off towards the edge of the field of view. \n \n \nFigure 2 \u03b3-ray image of the SNR RX J1713.7\u22123946 obtained with the H.E.S.S. telescopes. Hard \ncuts were applied to select well-reconstructed \u03b3-like events above 800 GeV. The map is smoothed \nas in Fig. 1, having the same scale in units of counts. We note that no background subtraction or \ncamera-efficiency corrections have been applied. This demonstrates that the structures seen are not \nartefacts of the analysis but real and visible in the raw post-cuts data (the background in the field of \nview is at a level of about five counts, and the efficiency across the SNR changes by less than 10%). \nThis image, obtained with a partial array during construction, demonstrates the ability of H.E.S.S. \nto map extended objects. The superimposed (linearly spaced) contours show the X-ray surface \nbrightness as seen by ASCA in the 1\u20133 keV range for comparison25. Note that the angular \nresolution of ASCA is comparable to that of H.E.S.S. which enables direct comparison of the two \nimages.
