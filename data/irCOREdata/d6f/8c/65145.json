However, turning these demands for \nbetter evidence about interventions around the social determinants of health into action requires \nidentifying what we already know and highlighting areas for further development.  \nMethods: Systematic review methodology was used to identify systematic reviews (from 2000-\n2007, developed countries only) that described the health effects of any intervention based on the \nwider social determinants of health: water and sanitation, agriculture and food, access to health \nand social care services, unemployment and welfare, work conditions, housing and living \nenvironment, education, and transport. \nResults: Thirty systematic reviews were identified. Generally, the effects of interventions on \nhealth inequalities were unclear. However, there is suggestive systematic review evidence that \ncertain categories of intervention may impact positively on inequalities or on the health of specific \ndisadvantaged groups, in particular interventions in the fields of housing and the work \nenvironment. \nConclusion: Intervention studies which address inequalities in health are a priority area for future \npublic health research.  \n \n \n174 words \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION  \nIt is well established that health follows a social gradient: better health with increasing socio-\neconomic position.[1] The importance of the social (as opposed to biological or genetic) causes of \nthis gradient \u2013 for example, housing quality, access to health care, or quality of work, has also \nbeen established.[2, 3] In turn, this has lead to increasing pressure in research, practice and \npolicy making environments to tackle these wider social determinants of health, through the \nimplementation of appropriate interventions and thereby reduce the gradient and health \ninequalities. [2-4] \n \nHowever, there are two concurrent problems. Firstly, the social determinants evidence base is \ndominated by descriptive, epidemiological studies which, by highlighting associations, are only \nimplicitly able to suggest possible interventions. For example studies consistently show \nassociations between higher job control and better mental health, by implication therefore \ninterventions which increase job control should result in health improvements.[5]  What is lacking \nthough is further evidence about what sort of interventions might be required or whether they will \nactually be effective in improving health or reducing the social gradient.  \n \nSecondly, where interventions aimed at reducing health inequalities have been developed and \nevaluated they tend to focus on modifying lifestyle factors such as smoking.  This may reflect the \nfact that lifestyle issues are often easier to identify and treat, or it may be indicative of differences \nin the respective evidence bases; with evidence on tackling the wider social determinants being \nless apparent and less accessible to policy makers and practitioners. Therefore, what is needed \nis evidence about what can actually be done to tackle the social determinants of health and \nhealth inequalities \u2013 specifically which interventions are effective and for whom.[6] This requires \nevaluative studies of interventions which address the social determinants of health. [3, 7] The \nWHO Measurement and Evidence Knowledge Network, for example, noted that it is vital to \ncontinue to develop evidence bases about tackling the social determinants of health and health \ninequalities.[8]  \n 4 \n \nHowever, turning this need for better evidence about interventions around the social determinants \nof health into action requires the identification of what we already know in terms of the effects of \ninterventions; and also identifying areas where new studies are needed. This information could \nthen be used to identify priorities for new research. It was in this context that the English \nDepartment of Health, Policy Research Programme, via the Public Health Research Consortium \n(PHRC) commissioned this umbrella review. Umbrella reviews are an increasingly common way \nof identifying, appraising, and synthesising systematic review evidence [9-12]. In addition, \numbrella reviews are able to present the overarching findings of such systematic reviews [13]. \nThis article therefore synthesises recent systematic reviews on the effects on health and health \ninequalities of interventions aimed at influencing the social determinants of health.  \n \nMETHODS \nSystematic review methodology was used to locate and evaluate published and unpublished \nsystematic reviews of interventions around the wider social determinants of health (\u201eumbrella\u201f \nreview). \n \nSearch Strategy  \nInitially, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Wider Public Health (WPH) database (a web \nbased database of systematic reviews of public health and related interventions) was manually \nsearched. This consists of evidence from systematic reviews relevant to public health policy and \npractice and covers the period from 2000 to 2002. To supplement this, the Cochrane Database of \nSystematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (both \nadministrative and public databases) were searched electronically whilst the Campbell \nCollaboration Database and the EPPI-Centre database of health promotion and public health \nstudies, were manually searched from January 2002 to April 2007. Electronic searches of the \nCriminal Justice Abstracts database (2000-2007) were also undertaken (as it is not covered by \nany of these databases of systematic reviews). Bibliographies, reference lists, and relevant \n 5 \nwebsites were also searched. Experts were contacted and we hand searched four leading \njournals (American Journal of Public Health, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Journal of \nEpidemiology and Community Health, Social Science and Medicine) from January 2002 to April \n2007.  Full search strategy is in Web Appendix 1.  \n \nInclusion and exclusion criteria  \nWe used the widely cited Dahlgren and Whitehead \u201erainbow\u201f model of the main determinants of \nhealth (Figure 1), as a framework to help to identify the range of social determinants upon which \ninterventions could be based.[14] We concentrated on the outer two layers, which included \nmacroeconomic, cultural and environmental conditions in the outermost layer; and living and \nworking conditions and access to essential goods and services in the next layer, specifically \nwater and sanitation, agriculture and food, access to health (and social care) services, \nunemployment (and welfare), work conditions, housing (and living environment), education and \ntransport. We therefore excluded reviews which only examined interventions based on the inner \nmost layers of the rainbow: individual lifestyle factors and social and community networks.  \n \nOnly studies of adult participants (16+) or the general population in developed countries (North \nAmerica, Europe, Australasia, Japan) were eligible for inclusion. We limited our study to adults \nbecause an Institute of Education team were conducting a concurrent umbrella review of child \nhealth outcomes.[15] In terms of outcomes, we were particularly interested in the impacts on \ninequalities in health or wellbeing (by socio-economic status) although we also looked at the \noverall health effect. We also considered as outcomes the non-health effects (such as \nemployment or income) on people from a disadvantaged group with a pre-existing health \ncondition. \n \nSystematic reviews had to meet the two mandatory criteria of Database of Abstracts of Reviews \nof Effects (DARE): (1) that there is a defined review question (with definition of at least two of, the \ninterventions, participants, outcomes or study designs), and (2) that the search strategy included \n 6 \nat last one named database, in conjunction with either reference checking, hand-searching, \ncitation searching or contact with authors in the field.   \n \nData Extraction  \nTwo reviewers (CB\/MG) independently screened all titles and abstracts identified from the \nliterature search for relevance (n=1694).  Full paper manuscripts of any titles\/abstracts that were \nconsidered relevant by either reviewer were obtained (n=84) and independently assessed for \ninclusion. Any discrepancies were resolved by consensus and if necessary a third reviewer (MP) \nwas consulted. Only studies meeting all the inclusion criteria were data extracted (n=30).  \n \n \nRESULTS \n30 systematic reviews of interventions were identified. These are synthesised by domain type in \ntables 1-4 and in the text below.  \n \nHousing and living environment  \nThere is a \u201chousing evidence base\u201d which goes back many decades; including early evaluation \nstudies from the 1930\u201fs, and a number of controlled trials, and more recently several randomised \ncontrolled trials.[16] Given this historical focus on the relationship between housing and health, it \nis probably not surprising that the systematic review housing evidence base is better developed \nthan for other domains.  We identified nine systematic reviews focusing on housing and health \n(Table 1):[17-24] two were of \u201csocial\u201d changes (rental assistance programmes);[17, 18] five were \nof \u201cenvironmental\u201d changes to housing (for example, changes in lighting, or physical \ninfrastructure, to reduce risk of falls, or injury); [19-23] and two were of wider area-based \ninitiatives. [24, 25] \n \nReviews of rental assistance (e.g. use of rent subsidies to create mixed-income or desegregated \nhousing in poorer U.S neighbourhoods) suggested that interventions to promote mixed housing \n 7 \nmay result in increases in perceived neighbourhood safety, perhaps because exposure to crimes \nagainst person and property is reduced, along with neighbourhood social disorder. There is \ntentative systematic review evidence that such housing mobility policies (at least in the US) do \nimprove health and health behaviours, but the effects are small. Research on the mechanisms is \nlacking and therefore required. General housing improvement is also associated with positive \nchange in social outcomes, including reductions in fear of crime, and improvements in social \nparticipation, These interventions ranged from home visits, risk assessments and removal of \nhazards to reduce the risk of injury; to physical changes to housing structure such as insulation, \nfurniture and more general housing policies. Although two reviews considered the effects on \ninequalities,[22, 25] none of the primary studies differentiated their results by socio-economic \nstatus.  \n \nWork environment \nThere has been a recent shift in focus, from work as a source of occupational diseases to the \nwider impacts of work on health and wellbeing.[5] This is reflected in the seven systematic \nreviews we located. [26-32]  They focussed on four types of intervention (Table 2): increased \nemployee control (via participatory \u201ehealth circle\u201f staff meetings to discuss ways to improve the \nwork environment, more generic staff participation at work, or task restructuring); [26-28] \nchanging the organisation of shift work (e.g. less nights, shorter shift lengths etc, or the \ncompressed working week);[29, 30] privatisation, [31] and the health and safety regulations.[32]  \n \nOverall, interventions to improve employee control (three reviews) [26-28] found consistently \npositive health effects when job control was actually increased[27] (and negative effects when job \ncontrol decreased).[28] The two reviews of changes to shift work [29, 30] identified some \ninterventions (such as increased control over shift times) which had positive impacts on self-\nreported (particularly mental) health.[30]  Conversely, The privatisation review suggested that job \ninsecurity and unemployment resulting from privatisation impacted adversely on mental \n 8 \nhealth.[31] The single review of increased health and safety legislation in the construction \nindustry found a decrease in fall-related injuries after the intervention.[32] \n \nFive of the reviews explicitly looked for evidence of effects on health inequalities and three, \nincluded studies which reported differences by socio-economic status (occupation).[27, 28, 31] In \none review of participatory interventions, [27] one uncontrolled study found improvements in \nterms of mental health outcomes amongst manual workers but not managers or clerical \nemployees. In another review of task restructuring,[28] an uncontrolled study found that the \nadverse health effects of a team working intervention were only experienced by the lowest grade \nof employees. The review of privatisation also identified one study which found that eight months \nafter privatisation, occupational stress increased only amongst clerical and administrative staff, \nand not among manual workers or managers.[31]  \n \nTransport \nTransport policies are often cited as a major influence on health and health inequalities, though it \nis a field where relatively few evaluative studies and reviews have been carried out (at least, ones \nmeasuring health outcomes). We located five reviews addressing transport issues (Table 3).[33, \n34] [35] [36] [37] Each dealt with a different type of intervention: promoting modal shift from \ndriving to walking and cycling; impacts of new roads; reductions in permissible alcohol when \ndriving, area-wide traffic calming and speed cameras. Despite the differences in intervention type, \nfour of the five reviews included outcomes related to road injuries. [33, 35-37]  \n \nIn relation to road injury outcomes, the review of legislative interventions to curb alcohol-impaired \ndriving[33] found strong evidence to support the reduction of fatal and non-fatal crashes, as did \nthe reviews of traffic calming interventions[35] and speed cameras [38].  Evidence for the impact \nof new of road building on injuries[36] was less conclusive, as whilst out of town bypasses \n 9 \ndelivered reductions in injuries, major new roads did not. There was very limited evidence \navailable on the health effects of interventions aiming to encourage modal transport shift from \ndriving to walking and cycling. [34]. None of the reviews presented any information relating to \nimpacts on health inequalities.  \n \nHealth and social care services \nAccess to effective health care is another determinant of population health. Several different \ntypes of access are relevant to the wider social determinants of health; in particular, geographic, \neconomic and cultural access. We identified four reviews in OECD countries (Table 3), three of \nwhich focused on interventions to improve cultural access (acceptability and appropriateness of \nservices) [39-41] and one [42] on improving geographic access (location and physical availability \nof health services) in rural areas. No reviews of economic access (affordability of services) were \nidentified relating to high-income countries.   \n \nOverall the evidence evaluating interventions to promote culturally relevant health care was \ngenerally inconclusive. For example, although positive effects were found for lay health workers \nin promoting immunisation uptake, there was insufficient evidence to support the use of lay health \nworkers in other contexts.[40] Rural outreach interventions improved geographic access to care, \nand self-reported health. [42] The reviews all focused on interventions intended to improve \naccess for disadvantaged groups (low income and minority populations) and there was some \nevidence that the interventions were effective e.g. ethnic minority patient satisfaction with health \ncare services increased after the cultural training intervention.[39] However, none of the reviews \nreported whether impacts of interventions differed for different groups in the population studied. \n \n \n \n 10 \nUnemployment and welfare \nThere is considerable observational evidence on the linkages between unemployment and health, \nwhich suggests that ill health can be both a cause and a consequence of unemployment (the \nlatter being the so-called \"direct health selection\" hypothesis).[43] Two of the three reviews we \nlocated in this domain were of interventions which aimed to assist those who were prevented \nfrom entering the labour market by ill health, for example through supported employment, \nproviding skills and training, and other mechanisms. [44, 45] The other review evaluated \ninterventions to increase the uptake of welfare entitlements. [46] Details of the reviews are \npresented in table 4.  \n \nOne review found that whilst supported employment delivered more positive employment \noutcomes than prevocational training, there was no significant improvement in comparison with \nstandard care.[44] Further, there was little evidence of any impact on health. Similarly, the review, \n[45] of welfare to work found some evidence of positive employment effects although it was not \nclear to what extent this was due the influence of contextual confounding factors. This review \ncontained no information on health outcomes. The review of welfare rights interventions[46] \nindicated that there were clear financial effects with a mean gain in income of \u00a31026 per client in \nthe year following the intervention (2004). However, the effects on health outcomes were limited \nto short-term improvements in mental health. None of the reviews specifically examined \ndifferential impacts across socioeconomic groups, although importantly all interventions were \ntargeted at disadvantaged groups.  \n \nAgriculture and food \nAgricultural policies affect the quality, quantity, price, and availability of food, all of which are \nimportant for public health.[47] While overall increases in life expectancy may be partly attributed \nto better nutrition, increases in the prevalence of obesity in many countries points to the \ncontribution food policies also make to over-nutrition. Agriculture and food policies and \n 11 \ninterventions may therefore provide some of the mechanisms for addressing diet-related health \ninequalities. However, only one review was identified (table 4).[48] This focussed on monetary \nincentives (including price decreases) on low-fat snacks, coupons for farmers' markets, financial \nrewards and free food provision. All four RCTs included in the review found a positive effect of \nincentives on the outcomes measured: weight loss, consumption of fruit and vegetables, \nredemption of coupons and attitudes towards fruit and vegetable consumption. None of the \nstudies differentiated their results by socio-economic position and none of the reviews focussed \non disadvantaged groups.  \n \nWater and sanitation \nThere are many aspects of water and sanitation likely to impact on population health. Aside from \nthe direct effects of pollution and contamination, other aspects of water management, including \nabstraction, water metering, and the provision of flood defences may all have potential public \nhealth implications. However, there are few available systematic reviews reporting health \noutcomes, and only one that met our inclusion criteria (table 4). [49] It focussed on changes in \nlevels of water fluoridation and did not report on the effects on health inequalities. The authors \nconcluded that fluoridation at levels up to 1ppm had no adverse effects on bone fracture \nincidence, bone mineral density or bone strength in developed countries.  \n \nEducation \nThere is undoubtedly a strong case for highlighting education as a major determinant of health \nand health inequalities \u2013 not least though its interaction with other determinants. For example: \n\u201cEducation has traditionally been an important route out of poverty for disadvantaged groups in \nmany countries. Generally, qualifications improve people\u2019s chances of getting a job and of having \nbetter pay prospects and the resulting increase in standard of living. This in turn improves \nopportunities to obtain the prerequisites for health \u2013 nutritious food, safe housing, a good working \nenvironment and social participation\u201d. [14] However, perhaps surprisingly, we found no \n 12 \nsystematic reviews of the health effects of adult education interventions in OECD countries \npublished in the current decade. It should be noted that person-based health education \ninterventions aimed at social determinants in the two inner most layers of the \u201cRainbow\u201d were \nexcluded from this review.   \n \n \nDISCUSSION  \nThis project aimed to identify the \u201cstate of the systematic review evidence base\u201d in the current \ndecade in developed countries, addressing the effects on health and health inequalities of \ninterventions targeting the social determinants of health, as well as identifying fruitful areas for \nfuture research. The study therefore does what it aims to do, but this is of necessity a very limited \nanswer to the problem of what works in terms of tackling health inequalities as disappointingly, \nvery few relevant reviews have been conducted. It has already been demonstrated elsewhere \nthat the public health evidence base is sparsely-populated [50] and this is particularly true in \nterms of evaluations of interventions addressing the social determinants of health, especially in \nrelation to health inequalities. Evidence on the differential impacts of interventions by socio-\neconomic position is largely absent (only three of 30 reviews presented results for specified \npopulation sub-groups), although this is likely to reflect the state of the primary study evidence \nbase rather than that of the systematic reviews. [22, 25, 29, 30, 34]  What we do have however is \nsuggestive evidence that certain categories of intervention may impact positively on inequalities \nor on the health of specific disadvantaged groups, in particular interventions in the fields of \nhousing and the work environment. \n \nIn the reviews of work environment interventions for example (such as changes to the \norganisation of work, and privatisation) there is evidence that the effects of change are \nexperienced differently by different levels of employee, and that health outcomes differed \naccordingly. This suggests - as noted by Marmot and others [51] - that the workplace may indeed \nbe an important setting in which inequalities may be addressed. Similarly there is suggestive \n 13 \nevidence that housing change may positively affect physical and mental health but the actual \neffects may be small.  \n \nIn the case of transport, the strongest evidence derives from studies of injury prevention, but the \nwider health impacts of transport policies on inequalities remain to be elucidated further. Given \nthe importance of access to healthcare in potentially helping to reduce health inequalities, it was \nnotable that there is still only limited evidence of effects on health and no direct evidence of \nimpacts on inequalities in health. Similarly, the systematic review evidence base in regards to the \nother social determinant domains is very limited particularly in terms of the effects of interventions \non health inequalities, and in the case of the unemployment and welfare domain on general \nhealth too.  \n \nWe found no reviews on interventions relating to macroeconomic, cultural and environmental \nconditions (the outermost layer of the rainbow \u2013 figure 1). These conditions influence the \nstandard of living achieved by different sections of the population, the prevailing level of income \ninequality, unemployment, job security and so on. Interventions within this category would \ntherefore be aimed at altering the macroeconomic or cultural environment to reduce poverty and \nthe wider adverse effects of inequality on society, including measures to ensure legal and human \nrights, \"healthier\" macroeconomic and labour market policies, the encouragement of cultural \nvalues promoting equal opportunities and environmental hazard control (including upholding \ninternational obligations and treaties in this field).[52] This gap may be as a result of our focus on \nintervention studies and it may well be that the evidence base therefore needs to be widened to \ninclude reviews of comparative (non-intervention) studies such as those conducted within social \nepidemiology (such as that by Lynch and colleagues on the association between income \ninequality and population health).[53]   \n \nClearly, education is the starkest example of an area in which there can be further development. \nThe reviews that do exist either date from pre-2000 or relate to developing countries. We located \n 14 \nno reviews relating to education and adult health outcomes published in this current decade \nconcerning the situation in the high-income countries of the OECD.  There are therefore \nunanswered questions, ripe for review, concerning the relationships between levels of education \nin a society and\/or the nature of educational systems and health outcomes, and how these health \noutcomes differ by socioeconomic position. \n \nSimilarly, it was particularly difficult to identify appropriate reviews in the domain of \u201caccess to \nhealth and social care\u201d as a social determinant of health. Despite extensive and rigorous \nsearching, we only identified four systematic reviews that met our inclusion criteria. Moreover, the \nstudies in the reviews do not represent the full range or intensity of potential intervention types in \nthis domain. There is, for example, a clear need for reviews of the effects of nationwide changes \nin health systems to improve geographic, economic or cultural access for the population as a \nwhole, and for groups in greater need in particular.  \n \nIn terms of the unemployment and welfare domain, there are still areas in need of further \nresearch particularly in terms of the effects on health of welfare to work policies (e.g. for lone \nparents, for the long-term unemployed, for young people); as well as the effects of interventions \ndesigned to prevent ill health amongst people out of work. Similarly, in the transport domain, the \neffects of policies to promote healthy transport (such as policies to promote walking) require \nfurther research.[54] More studies are needed in terms of food policies (e.g. the effects of the EU \nCommon Agricultural Policy on food pricing and consumption) and in relation to water and \nsanitation interventions, the effects of water metering, which, it has been suggested may to lead \nto poorer families economising on water to the detriment of child health, is an important gap in the \nsystematic review evidence.  \n \nLimitations  \nThe main challenge was simply that there were too few systematic reviews conducted. It was also \na challenge to locate the relevant systematic reviews which had been conducted. Searching for \n 15 \nstudies on the social determinants of health and\/or health inequalities is difficult and time-\nconsuming and the searches can often suffer from a lack of sensitivity and a lack of specificity \n[55, 56]. However, to ensure the searches were as extensive as possible, our search strategies \nwere piloted and revised. Further, the searches were conducted by experienced specialist staff at \nthe York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. In addition, leading public health journals were \nhand searched and review authors were contacted. Despite this, as for any review of complex \nand difficult-to-define social interventions, it is not possible to be sure that all reviews have been \nlocated.[56] However there is confidence that the gaps identified, while perhaps surprising, are \nreal. Another important issue to consider with umbrella reviews is the risk of study overlap \nbetween the included systematic reviews. However, in keeping with previous public health policy \numbrella reviews,[9] we found very little overlap e.g. in the work environment domain there were \nno common studies. A more general limitation of public policy research is also relevant as a lot of \nthe studies included in this umbrella review are from the USA and there is evidence that the \ncontextual determinants of health act differently in the USA than in Europe, due in part to the \ndifferent welfare systems in place.[57] The findings of the USA studies may not therefore be \neasily transferrable to the European policy context.  \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nIt appears, then, that not only is the public health systematic review evidence base weak in terms \nof how to tackle the social determinants, but that there are specific areas which appear especially \nsparsely-populated. These are sector-wide policies in education, the health system, food and \nagriculture, and more generally on the influence of macro-level policies on health inequalities. \nAlthough it is now a given that the effects of any interventions on inequalities should be assessed, \nthe systematic review evidence base does not yet allow us to say with any confidence what the \neffects of interventions on reducing health inequalities are, because differential impacts by \nsocioeconomic position are rarely assessed. Nonetheless one of the positive messages from this \numbrella review is that there is a growing systematic review evidence base around housing and \n 16 \nregeneration, and a significant evidence base on the work environment suggesting that this is \nindeed a sector with significant responsibility for improving health and reducing inequalities. \nGiven the few intervention studies which address inequalities, it is particularly important to \nassemble evidence on the mechanisms by which policies may affect health; this will help identify \npoints at which to intervene and will provide a framework for the development of new research. \n[52]  For example, the results of systematic reviews that have evaluated the effects of \ninterventions on the determinants of health (but which do not have health as an outcome), could \nalso be examined and their findings extrapolated to tackling health inequalities. This is consistent \nwith the WHO Commission on Social Determinants and the Measurement and Evidence \nKnowledge Network advice that as evidence comes in many shapes and forms, there is a need to \nget smarter about synthesizing and appraising that evidence.[8] \n \n 17 \nAuthors and Contributors \nCB participated in the design of the study, collected, analysed and synthesised the data; led the \nwriting of the article, and is a guarantor.

Although there is suggestive \nevidence that certain categories of intervention may impact positively on inequalities \nor on the health of specific disadvantaged groups, in particular interventions in the \nfields of housing and the work environment. \n 19 \nREFERENCES \n \n \n1 Graham H.
