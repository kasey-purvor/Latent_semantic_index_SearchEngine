Social capital \nprovides a comprehensive framework for examining the nature of social connections \nthrough its focus on both structural networks (bridging) and interpersonal \nrelationships that predispose individuals towards mutually beneficial collective action \n(bonding).  In doing so, social capital provides a means of considering how \nindividuals react to management control systems in terms of the social ties that exist \nboth within the organization and external to the organization.  Using a case study of a \nnon-government organization, we show how social capital is implicated in efforts to \nattract economic capital and cultural capital. We demonstrate how elements of a \nmanagement control system can either enhance or inhibit the bonding and bridging \ndimensions of social capital with potential consequences on both economic and \ncultural capital. We highlight the mixed and sometimes contradictory effects of \nmanagement control systems on social capital, and provide a powerful illustration of \nthe role of management control systems in brokering alliances and bridging structural \nholes. \n \nKey words: social capital, management control systems, non-government \norganizations. \n  \n 2 \nSocial capital and management control systems: a study of a non-government \norganization \nNon-government organizations (NGOs) have a central role in delivering \nwelfare services.  NGOs rely on developing social connections to draw together those \nin need with service providers and suppliers of welfare funding. This raises issues of \nhow social connectedness can help organizations, such as NGOs, to deliver their \nservices, and, consequently, has encouraged researchers to examine social \ninfrastructures that facilitate individual and collective action of many kinds (Coleman, \n1990; Foley & Edwards, 1999).  Across a broad range of disciplines, the study of \nsocial connectedness has been facilitated by examining the phenomenon of social \ncapital. Adler and Kwon (2002, p. 17) note \u201cA growing number of sociologists, \npolitical scientists, and economists have invoked the concept of social capital in the \nsearch for answers to a broadening range of questions being confronted in their own \nfields.\u201d  On this basis, we explore how social capital may contribute to knowledge in \nthe area of management control systems (MCS) and how it may affect the \nmanagement of NGOs.   \nIn this study our particular interest is in NGOs that provide welfare services to \nthe community within the institutional space termed \u2018civil society\u2019.1  Providing \nwelfare involves NGOs developing an identity to deliver humanitarian services and to \nattract economic capital to fund operations.  At times these two functions can be in \ntension. Social capital has a potential role in delivering services and attracting \nresources, and in managing the tension between the two.  Also, MCS are used both to \n                                                 \n1 While \u2018civil society\u2019 has been defined in numerous ways, the term is generally taken to mean a realm \nor space where there are a set of organizational actors who are not part of the household, the market, or \nthe state (Lewis, 2007, p. 54).  Lewis & Madon (2004, p. 120) define civil society as \u201c\u2026an institutional \nspace between state, market, and household in which citizens could form associations, organize public \naction, and represent their interests and aspirations.\u201d \n 3 \nassist in attracting economic capital and in delivering welfare services. Our study is \nconcerned with understanding the interrelationship between MCS and social capital. \nSpecifically, we examine how the combination of MCS and social capital can be \neither more, or less, effective in helping NGOs maintain their identity and capabilities \nto deliver services, while gaining funding. \nWe draw on the work of Bourdieu (1986) and Oakes et al. (1998) in \nelaborating on the inherent tension facing NGOs as they struggle to balance the desire \nto maintain their core values and work processes based on humanitarian ideals (their \ncultural capital) with the need to attract sufficient economic capital.  To help \nunderstand how social capital is used by NGOs to deliver effective welfare services, \nwe also draw on a stream of social capital research that focuses on the mechanisms \nthat can strengthen the integration of agents to best effect co-ordinated actions, and \nexamines how social capital can create consensus and sustain the stable development \nof society (Putnam, 1993; Coleman, 1990), as well as provide advantages for \norganizations (Krackhardt & Hanson, 1993; Hargadon & Sutton, 1997) and \nindividuals (Gabbay & Zuckerman, 1998; Burt, 1992). From this literature we use the \nconcept of structural bridging to analyse networks of social ties, and relational \nbonding to examine how individuals are predisposed towards mutually beneficial \ncollective action.  Identifying these distinct dimensions helps isolate different \nadvantages (and disadvantages) that can be derived from social capital (Gittell & \nVidal, 1998), particularly related to information, power and solidarity (Adler & \nKwon, 2002).  \nIn overview, examining how organizations seek to develop economic and \ncultural capital allows us to identify what is at stake as NGOs respond to pressure to \nbe more efficient and effective. Although attempts to attract economic capital may \n 4 \ndestroy cultural capital (Oakes et al., 1998), some research suggests that bonding and \nbridging can play a role in attracting economic capital while preserving cultural \ncapital, although this is by no means assured (Adler & Kwon, 2002).  We argue that \nMCS have potential effects on bonding and bridging, both positive and negative.  \nConsequently, important insights into the generation of economic and cultural capital \ncan be gained by considering how MCS are implicated in the processes of bonding \nand bridging social capital.     \nFrom a MCS perspective, considering social capital helps to understand how \ncombinations of controls can have complementary or conflicting effects which may \ninfluence organizational outcomes.  Typically, formal controls are an important facet \nof MCS and help to maintain financial viability and develop efficient and effective \nwork processes.2  The MCS literature has also shown that employing more flexible, \norganic controls can help maintain employee commitment and a sense of innovation, \nand that MCS may be most effective when formal and organic controls operate in \ncombination (Davila et al., 2009).  By focusing on social capital, specifically the \nsocial ties involved in bonding and bridging, we are able to enrich understanding of \nthe processes whereby formal and organic controls, and their combination, have their \neffects.   Thus, social capital is important as it allows us to consider how different \naspects of MCS can have effects on how individuals react, not only within the \norganization but also external to the organization.     \nTo summarize, our study is one of the first to analyse the use of MCS in \nNGOs and thus responds to the call for research into issues of management and \n                                                 \n2 To classify formal controls we draw on Simons\u2019 (1995) levers of control (LOC) framework that \nidentifies belief and boundary systems, and diagnostic and interactive control systems. We also \nconsider the concepts of enabling and coercive controls to show how effective controls must have \nsufficient information and means of engagement to enable employees to address their areas of \noperation (Ahrens & Chapman, 2004).  We use these frameworks, separately and in combination, to \nhelp elaborate on how MCS can help or hinder the development of social capital.   \n \n 5 \nmanagement control in these types of organizations (Hopwood, 2005; Lewis, 2003; \nEbrahim, 2003).  Specifically, we explore how the connection between MCS and \nsocial capital can potentially enhance or damage an NGO\u2019s ability to manage the \ntension between attracting sufficient economic capital while sustaining cultural \ncapital. Within this context, the study contributes to understanding the role of MCS in \nseveral ways.    \n1. The study identifies how formal MCS have mixed effects on social capital. \nFormal controls adopted to attract and maintain economic capital can damage internal \nbonding with potential negative effects on service delivery, but enhance an NGO\u2019s \nprospects to develop bridging social capital to attract economic capital while \npreserving cultural capital.  \n2. Our study highlights the potential contradictory effects on social capital from \nthe use of belief systems to develop and reinforce values. We show how active use of \nbelief systems helps to manage and maintain employees\u2019 identification with core \nvalues and thus develop strong bonding within organizations; yet such strong bonding \nleads to an inward focus and inhibits openness to developing bridging with other \norganizations.  \n3.  We provide a powerful illustration of the role of MCS in brokering alliances \nand bridging structural holes. We elaborate on how an NGO can promote the \npreservation of its cultural capital when developing alliances by bridging structural \nholes, and show how formal MCS support this process by demonstrating and \nlegitimizing the capabilities of the NGO to others in the alliance.  \n4. We draw attention to difficulties in introducing formal controls where more \ninformal, organic processes are the customary form of control.  We suggest that the \n\u2018interactive use\u2019 of formal controls can be compatible with customary organic \n 6 \nprocesses if they have enabling characteristics. In this way formal controls may assist \nin developing internal bonding social capital.   \n The remainder of the paper is structured in three sections. The first section \npresents a review of relevant literature. The second section outlines our field study \nincluding discussion of our method and presentation and discussion of the results.  In \nthe third and final section we present conclusions and limitations of the study. \n \nLiterature review \n We commence the literature review by considering the extent to which social \ncapital has been examined in management control systems research.  Next we identify \nhow Bourdieu (1986) conceived of social capital as combining with economic and \ncultural capital to provide entities with advantage. We show how economic and \ncultural can be in tension and how social capital can potentially resolve this tension.  \nFollowing are sections that consider the properties and outcomes of social capital, and \nthe way in which management control systems may be linked to social capital.  \nFinally, we discuss the institutional context within which our study is positioned to \nshow how NGOs face a setting in which there is increased pressure from government \nto demand accountability in the public sector, including NGOs, by way of the \napplication of formal accounting systems. \n \nSocial capital and prior management control systems research \nThere are relatively few prior studies on the role of MCS in the development \nof social capital at the organizational level.3  However, themes relevant to the concept \n                                                 \n3 Jacobs & Kemp (2002) found that among Bangladeshi small traders, the absence of accounting could \nbe explained by the presence of social capital. Awio et al. (2007) found that in Uganda, community-led \ninitiatives had the potential to enhance social capital and lead to improved accountability and social \noutcomes. \n 7 \nof social capital have been explored in research on inter-organizational relationships. \nOne line of research has focused on how social networks can be structured to facilitate \ncoordination, typically between an organization and its suppliers. The structuring of \nnetworks is relevant to social capital (see Mouritsen & Hansen [2006] and H\u00e5kansson \n& Lind [2007] for overviews of the role of MCS within enterprise networks). Other \nresearch has examined how relationships between an organization and important \noutside parties are influenced by accounting controls and social processes involving \nhigh levels of trust (H\u00e5kansson & Lind, 2007).  \nWhile the MCS literature has investigated how inter-organizational \nrelationships can involve structures of networks and informal, trust-based controls, \nthese studies are based, in the main, on dyadic relationships between organizations \nand a key constituent, such as suppliers. This potentially limits consideration of the \ntotality of relationships and network connections that relate to the development of \nsocial capital. There are only a small number of accounting studies that have \nexamined how organizations interrelate within the broader network of entities with \nwhich they interact (see, for example, Tomkins [2001], Mouritsen & Thrane [2006] \nand Chua & Mahama [2007]). While prior MCS research into networks has not \nexplicitly examined social capital, Mouritsen & Thrane (2006, p. 245) acknowledge a \npotential role: \u201cit is also possible to study networks through social capital. Here \nnetworks are not in principle flat structures but ones structured by social capital. \nSocial capital positions actors in social structures or relations and determines the \nactor\u2019s life-chances (Coleman, 1988; 1990).\u201d  This indicates a potentially important \nrole for social capital in developing understanding of how social ties deliver benefits \nwithin network relationships and how MCS are implicated in these processes. \n \n 8 \nSocial capital within Bourdieu\u2019s concept of capitals \nBourdieu (1986, 1993, 1998) considers how social connections can be used to \ngain individual advantage.  He identifies economic, cultural and social forms of \ncapital, control over which helps entities maintain a position in the status hierarchy of \nsociety and to exercise and resist domination in social relations.4  Bourdieu\u2019s concern \nwith capitals is to help explain the reproduction of social inequality and the \nmaintenance of capitalist order through the accumulation of various capitals. \nHowever, economic and social capitals can readily be identified, more generally, as \nattributes of organizations. Cultural capital can also be identified at the organizational \nlevel, as the \u2018knowledge, practices, and goods\u2019 that are consecrated as rare and \ndesirable by organizations and that play a role in their social reproduction (Rubtsova \n& Dowd, 2004).5  Importantly, it has been argued that cultural capital can be \nemployed by organizations for status attainment (Lamont & Lareau, 1988).    \nIn our study, economic and cultural capitals are important to defining positions \nand possibilities for various NGOs in society. Social capital is important as it enables \norganizations to build cultural capital and attract economic capital. Symbolic capital, \nas part of social capital, provides the basis for social position in a given society and is \nbased on intersubjective reflections; it is in the \u2018eyes of the others\u2019. The power to \n                                                 \n4 Economic capital involves stocks of assets either physical or intangible, property, cash, shares and the \nlike. Cultural capital involves three aspects. The first of these is habitus which is a lasting, generalized \nand transposable disposition to act in conformity with a (quasi) systematic view of the world and \nhuman existence (Bourdieu, 1987:126).  It can involve deeply ingrained aspects such as race, ethnicity, \ngender that defines a person\u2019s character and way of thinking.  The second is objectivization as in \ncultural articles (e.g. works of art), and the third, cultural institutions (e.g. certificates, diplomas).  \nSocial capital is seen to have two dimensions. First, it involves group membership and social networks \nsuch as voluntary associations, trade unions, political parties and the like.  Second, it involves symbolic \ncapital that provides differences between groups or classes that provides symbolic recognition and \ndistinction.  \n5    Rubtsova & Dowd (2004) claim that Bourdieu\u00b9s cultural capital can be extended to the \norganizational level. At this level, organizations can develop homogenous schemes of appreciation and \naction based on the \nproduction of specialized cultural knowledge and practices. Such knowledge and practices are valuable \nand distinctive and can therefore provide advantages and access to resources. \n \n 9 \ninfluence what constitutes cultural capital within a specific field is derived from \nsymbolic capital.   \nThe NGO sector can be seen as distinctive in that there has traditionally been \nan ethos of a \u2018sacrifice of selfish interests\u2019, a belief in a legitimate way of operating to \nachieve common social ends, even if this occurs in situations where different NGOs \nmay have different degrees of recognition, power and influence (Lewis, 2007).  Many \nNGOs see economic capital as a means to develop cultural capital, unlike more \ncommercially-based organizations that employ cultural capital to maximize economic \ncapital.6  This is not to say that individual NGOs are not selfishly interested in their \ncontinued existence and prosperity. Clearly, there is competition for resources and \noften client groups.  However, because the driving forces for NGOs typically involve \na social rather than a profit mission, there tends to be more engagement in \ncollaborative effort to achieve common social outcomes. Also, there is a more subtle \nbalance between the use of power derived from the possession of cultural, economic \nand social capital for individual advantage and the use of these capitals to advance \noverall social welfare. \nThe tension between cultural and economic capital in NGOs and the way in \nwhich cultural capital can be eroded by the dominance of economic capital, facilitated \nby accounting systems, is illustrated in a study by Oakes et al. (1998).  In Oakes et al. \n(1998), formal planning and accounting systems, imposed by outsiders, were used to \nshift the focus away from cultural capital, based on historic and authentic ideals, to a \nmuch greater concern with economic capital. Using Bourdieu\u2019s concept of symbolic \n                                                 \n6 While the basic conviction of many NGOs is to place cultural capital before economic capital, NGOs \nare not homogenous in this respect.  There is a broad range of NGOs operating internationally and \nwithin countries, providing variation in scale, operations, fundamental ethos and beliefs.  This \ngenerates variation in the emphasis and orientation towards cultural and economic capital.  However, \nthe tension between cultural and economic capital remains common to most NGOs, although how they \nare traded-off may well differ (Ebrahim, 2003).    \n 10 \nviolence, Oakes et al. (1998) showed how the planning systems had subtle, rather than \nexplicit effects, whereby employees embraced the new ethos where economic capital \nbecame dominant, with the cost that the historically-based cultural capital lost much \nof its importance.  In this context, social capital provides a way of examining how \nNGOs can manage the potential tension between cultural and economic capital to suit \ntheir purposes. In particular, we explore how the connections between MCS and \nsocial capital can help an NGO to resist the potential for symbolic violence arising \nfrom pressures to be more attentive to economic capital. \nIn the next sections we elaborate on the properties and outcomes of social \ncapital, and then consider the way in which MCS and social capital may be connected. \nWe conclude the literature review by noting the institutional background to our study \nwhere MCS are becoming increasingly important to NGOs as government funding \nagencies encourage them to embrace ideas of new public management. \n \nThe properties of social capital \nSocial capital relates to existing and emerging social infrastructures that \nfacilitate individual and collective actions of many kinds (Foley & Edwards, 1999). In \nthis study we consider social capital as a property of an organization, where individual \nand collective actions provide actual or potential benefits for organizations (Baker, \n1990; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Portes, 1998; Adler & Kwon, 2002).7  Social \ncapital can substitute for other resources such as financial or human capital by \n                                                 \n7 Social capital, as an organizational asset, is similar to the idea that intellectual capital is generated by \nthe endeavours of individuals but resides at the organizational level (Sveiby, 1997).  Sveiby (1997, \np.10) sees employee competence, internal structures and external structures as generating the intangible \nassets of an organization.  He notes it is impossible to conceive of an organization without people but \nas the people are voluntary members of an organization, their endeavours provide benefits for the \norganization.   \n 11 \nproviding strong network connections and social ties (Coleman, 1990), which is \nparticularly important in the NGO context where financial capital can be limited.8    \nScholars seeking to relate social capital to the achievement of desired \noutcomes by the integration of agents to best effect co-ordinated actions have \nelaborated the concept of social capital as having different facets, aspects and \ndimensions (Coleman, 1990; Schiff, 1992; Fukuyama, 1995; Brehm & Rahn, 1997). \nConsistent with a large body of research on social capital, we distinguish between \nbridging as a structural dimension of social capital, and bonding as a relational \ndimension of social capital (e.g., Granovetter, 1992; Gittell & Vidal, 1998; Nahapiet \n& Ghoshal, 1998; Woolcock, 1998; Putnam, 2000; Adler & Kwon, 2002).  \nThe bridging and bonding dimensions of social capital help recognise that \nspecific opportunities can arise from establishing networks of social ties between \norganizations, and that these networks can be effected by nurturing motivation within \n(and between) organizations through bonding (Lesser, 2000). By drawing on literature \nthat examines the bridging and bonding dimensions of social capital and their \npotential outcomes (e.g. information, power and solidarity), we can focus on how \nMCS may enhance or damage social capital.  \nIn overview, the bridging dimension of social capital concerns the quantum of \nties and the structure of the network of the relations as a whole. Bonding refers to the \nquality of social ties in terms of the extent to which values are shared. While it is \ncommon to consider bonding as it exists within organizations (Adler & Kwon, 2002), \nit is also apparent that bonding can develop between organizations (Nahapiet & \n                                                 \n8 Other non-physical assets have also been identified in accounting research as providing value. For \nexample, intellectual capital is the knowledge and knowing capability of an organization that provide a \nsource of value (Mouritsen, Larsen & Bukh, 2001). Human and social capital are sometimes confused.  \nHuman capital is the stock of skills and knowledge embodied in the ability to perform work so as to \nproduce economic value (Widener, 2004). It is the skills and knowledge gained by a worker through \neducation and experience. On the other hand, social capital provides value through the benefits that can \nbe derived from both bonding and bridging (Adler & Kwon, 2002).    \n 12 \nGhoshal, 1998).9 Table 1 elaborates on the properties of the bridging and bonding \ndimensions of social capital. \n[Insert Table 1 here] \n \nOutcomes of social capital  \nAdler & Kwon (2002) note that organizational investments in social capital \nneed to be guided by understanding the meaning of bridging and bonding and the \ndifferent potential benefits and disadvantages from these dimensions. While we \nexamine the possible influences of each dimension of social capital, we note that these \ndimensions act in combination, with bonding involving common norms and \nassociability, and that action based on these values is carried out collectively through \nstructural networks (Leana & Van Buren, 1999).   \nTable 1 outlines the potential beneficial outcomes and disadvantages of both \nbonding and bridging social capital. In summary, prior research indicates that the \npotential benefits of social capital include: greater access to and more sharing of \nquality information through bridging between networks (Burt, 1997; Hansen, 1999); \nincreased power and authority, particularly when connecting parties in sparse (rather \nthan dense) networks (Granovetter, 1973; 1983); and greater solidarity and \ncooperation through the sharing of social norms and beliefs (Adler & Kwon, 2002; \nOuchi, 1980). While solidarity is most often related to social capital within \n                                                 \n9 In our work we are interested in how bonding and bridging are exercised to achieve close \ninterpersonal relationships and networks of value to the organization. This is somewhat analogous to \nthe difference between the content of social capital and the processes involved in its generation (see \nAdam & Ron\u0109evi\u010d, 2003, pp. 158-160, 164-167 for a discussion of the difference between types and \nfunctions of social capital).  While the processes to effect social capital may be seen as an antecedent to \nthe actual content of social capital, understanding the content is necessary to assess the evolving nature \nof the construct. In this sense process affects content and content affects process (Chenhall, 2005).  \n 13 \norganizations, it may encourage organizational citizenship which spills over to \nexternal networks (Granovetter, 1983; Putnam, 1993).10  \nThe disadvantages of social capital, however, may outweigh these benefits \n(Portes & Landolt, 1996; Gabbay & Leenders, 1999; Leana & Van Buren, 1999). The \npotential disadvantages of social capital include: its costs of development and \nmaintenance, an inward focus leading to parochialism and inertia (Powell & Smith-\nDoerr 1994; Uzzi, 1997; Gargiulo & Bernassi, 1999), which may be overcome by \nusing information and knowledge from networks outside the organization \n(Granovetter, 1983; Burt, 2002); and collective rivalry of network partners against \neach other, with each pursuing their own special interests at the expense of the \nbroader network (Foley & Edwards, 1996; Gabbay & Zuckerman, 1998). As Adler & \nKwon (2002, p. 31) note: \u2018There is no invisible hand that assures that the use of social \ncapital resources in competition among actors will generate an optimal outcome for \nthe broader aggregate\u2019.    \n \nLinking MCS to social capital \nWhile our investigation was not constrained by a focus on any particular MCS \nframework, it is apparent from the MCS literature that the notion of formal and \n                                                 \n10 An issue related to solidarity is the relationship between social capital and trust. For some \ncommentators social capital is a means whereby trust can be developed to enhance solidarity \n(Krackhardt & Hanson, 1993). However, the role of trust can be ambiguous and can obfuscate the \npotential benefits of social capital on solidarity. Free (2008) notes that trust is not the only antecedent \nto cooperation.  Certainly within the social capital literature solidarity from bonding can involve many \nsources including motivation derived from a willingness to define and enact collective goals (Leana & \nVan Buren, 1999), and generalized reciprocity. There is also the danger of overrating the benefits of \ntrust.  Free (2008) notes that power can be disguised behind a facade of trust, and then used to promote \nvested interests and exploit weaker partners. He notes the idea of \u2018cheap talk\u2019 that concerns \nexaggerating the benefits of trust with the intent to use trust as a strategic resource and to use this \nopportunistically.  Free (2008, p. 649) prefers to define trust in terms of \u2018accommodative intentions\u2019, \n\u2018reliability\u2019 and \u2018commitment\u2019. This idea seems consistent with generalized reciprocity and avoids the \nuse of trust as a discursive resource. For these reasons we do not emphasize the role of trust in the \nstudy of social capital.  \n \n 14 \ninformal controls provides a basis to elaborate on classifications of controls \n(Hopwood, 1972; Merchant, 1981; Simons, 1995; Chenhall & Morris, 1995; Ahrens \n& Chapman, 2004).   Combining formal and informal controls has been  important in \nunderstanding how MCS can be designed and implemented and their effects on \norganizational outcomes (Simons, 1995; Chenhall & Morris, 1995; Ahrens & \nChapman, 2004)11,  including, in our study, the potential effects of MCS on the study \nof social capital.  \nWe first discuss the meaning of three taxonomies of MCS that have elaborated \non both formal and informal aspects of controls.  These are organic and formal \ncontrols (Chenhall & Morris, 1995), the levers of control framework (Simons, 1995), \nand enabling and coercive controls (Adler & Borys, 1996; Ahrens & Chapman, 2004).  \nTable 2 provides a summary of the links to and possible tensions between the controls \nand social capital. We use these classification schemes, separately and in \ncombination, to examine the connections between MCS and social capital.  \nFormal controls have been distinguished from informal or organic controls in \nthe organizational (Burns and Stalker, 1961; Mintzberg & Waters, 1985) and \naccounting literatures (Chenhall & Morris, 1995; Merchant and Van der Stede, 2007). \nOrganic controls are based on informal processes, a free flow of information \nthroughout the organization, and flexibility to encourage adaptive decision making \nand to foster interactions within the organization (Simons, 1995; Chenhall & Morris, \n1995; Davila et al., 2009). In contrast, formal controls are deliberately articulated \npractices and include formal planning systems such as budgets and control \nmechanisms such as variance analysis against standard costs (Simons, 1995; Davila et \nal, 2009). Although organic controls have been the customary form of controls in \n                                                 \n11  As discussed in this section, we distinguish formal controls as deliberately articulated practices that \nrelate to  formal planning and control  from  organic controls that relate to informal processes, loose \nstructures and open communication (Chenhall & Morris, 1995).   \n 15 \nNGOs, formal controls have been introduced to provide a more business-like \napproach to acquiring and managing resources (Lewis, 2007). \nSimons (1995) elaborates on aspects of formal controls within his levers of \ncontrol framework.  He identifies belief and boundary systems which can be used to \narticulate and advertise the aims of the organization. MCS based on formal controls \nare divided into diagnostic and interactive control systems.  Diagnostic control \nsystems are formal practices that measure and monitor outcomes and guide corrective \naction, and are used as levers in implementing intended strategy (p. 63) and providing \nguidance to employees to work towards agreed goals (p. 70).12  In Simons\u2019 (1995) \nwork, the role of interactive control systems occupies a higher level of attention in \nterms of how they are used. Simons distinguishes interactive control systems as the \nway managers use formal practices to involve themselves regularly and personally in \nthe decision activities of subordinates by way of face to face meetings (p. 95). \nAdditionally, the formal practices are used to motivate information gathering outside \nroutine channels to help identify strategic uncertainties and emerging strategies (p. \n96).   \nNotwithstanding a more interactive use of formal controls, these can be \nembedded within a bureaucratic approach to control. Adler & Borys (1996) elaborate \non how formal controls positioned with bureaucratic structures can assist in providing \nmore flexible adaptive control cultures, consistent with organic controls, when they \nare designed and implemented with enabling rather than coercive capabilities. Ahrens \n& Chapman (2004) employed the notions of enabling and coercive controls to show \n                                                 \n12 Diagnostic use of formal controls is a somewhat elaborated idea of Simons\u2019 original diagnostic \ncontrol systems that we employ in our study as it assists in understanding the processes involved in \nemploying MCS practices at the operational level.  Particularly, we investigate how diagnostic use of \nformal controls involves communicating and educating employees about proposed goals and targets, \nassessing how operations are performing against plans (financial and non-financial), and in motivating \ndeliberation at the operational level on how variances may be addressed.   \n 16 \nhow MCS that had enabling features helped put employees in a restaurant chain into a \nposition whereby they could deal directly with the contingencies of their work \nsituation.  To help achieve this, the design characteristics of the MCS were that they \nenabled employees to repair local situations, and that they had internal transparency, \nglobal transparency, and flexibility. We see the taxonomies of the levers of control \nand enabling and coercive controls as complementary as Adler & Borys (1996) \nelaborate on how formal controls (such as interactive control systems) positioned \nwithin bureaucratic structures can assist in providing more flexible and adaptive \ncontrols in cultures that may be consistent with organic controls, but only when they \nare designed and implemented with enabling capabilities.   \nIn Table 2 we describe and distinguish the three taxonomies of MCS, each \nrooted in the distinction between relative formality and informality. We relate these \ntaxonomies to the context of NGOs, indicate potential links to social capital and \nhighlight possible tensions between control elements as they concern the development \nof social capital.  These three taxonomies illuminate how the application of MCS can \nhelp or hinder the development of social capital. While we have identified the \nseparate potential effects of various aspects of management controls, we acknowledge \nthat different controls can operate collectively (Widener, 2007).   \n \n [Insert Table 2 here] \n \n Institutional context: The drive for new public management and the NGO \nThe pressure to adopt MCS in the public sector has in many Western \ncountries, including Australia, been embraced within ideas of \u2018new public \nmanagement\u2019 (NPM).  This approach was introduced by the State governments of \n 17 \nAustralia as part of reform programs that accompanied changes in government in the \n1990s. Other aspects of the reforms included a reduction in the budgetary \nrequirements, downsizing the public services, privatizing the government operations \nand deregulating private economic enterprises (Aucoin, 1990). NPM aims to move \npublic sector organizations towards a managerialist philosophy with implicit values of \neconomic rationalism (Guthrie, Olson & Humphrey, 1999; Jones, Guthrie & Steane, \n2001). It has been claimed this may damage the long-term sustainability of public-\nsector organizations (Guthrie, Cuganesan & Boedker, 2005).   \nThe Australian NGO sector is heavily reliant on government funding for its \ncontinued operations, and thus is subject to these government pressures for increased \naccountability and formal reporting. In the State in which our study is located, the \nimplementation of NPM reforms and the transition towards managerialist models \ninvoked the use of more formal control systems, including a shift towards the \napplication of formal accounting and reporting techniques (Guthrie, Carlin & \nYongvanich, 2004). With the advent of NPM, professionals and managers in social \nwelfare have been subjected to quantitative performance indicators, often expressed in \naccounting terms (English, Guthrie & Parker, 2005). This has introduced practices \ncontrary to customary approaches in social welfare departments where qualitative \nassessment had been the norm.13  \n Within this context, our paper is complementary and contributes to the \nliterature that has examined resistance from public sector employees (professionals) to \nthe introduction of financial controls (bureaucratic approaches) that is part of the push \n                                                 \n13 Changes in NGOs from traditional to business-like values have resonance to studies of cultural \nchange. Several studies have shown the influence of accounting to help effect this change in culture \n(Ezzamel & Bourn, 1990; Dent, 1991; Blomgren, 2003; Kurunm\u00e4ki, 2004; Mueller & Carter, 2007). \nWhat these studies don\u2019t explicitly consider is the \u201cspillover\u2019 effect of these changes in culture to \nrelationships external to the organization.  Our case adds to these insights by demonstrating how \nmanagement controls influence reactions to cultural change, within the organization and externally.  \n 18 \nfor NPM (Dent & Whitehead, 2002).  We explore how NGOs react to attempts to \nintroduce the new logic of financial controls, and show how social capital is central to \nunderstanding the responses of NGOs. By studying social capital much can be learned \nabout the benefits and pitfalls to the operations of NGOs of using the new financial \nlogic.14 \n \nDesign and Research Method \nResearch site selection \n We selected an NGO as our research site due to the importance of social capital \nto such organizations (Lewis, 2007), thus providing an appropriate setting to explore the \ndynamics of the relationship between social capital and MCS. The field study was \nundertaken within Carewell, a welfare agency founded in 1977 that operates in a major \nAustralian city.15 The focus of our empirical analysis is the Tennant Centre, the largest \nand most established of Carewell\u2019s divisions. The field research was conducted over a \n12-month period from July 2007 to June 2008.  Over the 12 months, we conducted 16 \nin-depth interviews with 12 key personnel spanning across all levels of the \norganizational structure, with further details provided in Table 3. Additionally, we had \nregular contact with Tennant\u2019s manager and administrative officer and more focused \nfollow-up discussions with Carewell\u2019s CEO and the Business Director.16  Given the \n                                                 \n14 The pressure from government to coerce NGOs to adopt MCS as part of NPM has also been \naddressed within institutional theory (see for example, DiMaggio & Powell, 1983, 1991; Covaleski & \nDirsmith, 1988; Covaleski, Dirsmith, & Michelman, 1993). Critiques of institutional theory propose \nthat while accounting practices may be adopted for legitimization they may also assist managers in \nreacting strategically to select, purposefully, management systems to achieve their organization\u2019s goals \n(Covaleski & Dirsmith, 1988; Powell, 1991; Scott, 1995). Moreover, it can be argued that institutional \ntheory does not fully capture the nature of social ties in organizations\u2019 responses to institutional forces. \nSocial capital enriches institutional theory by explicitly considering the nature of these ties. \n15 The identities of individuals within the organization, and of the organization itself, have been disguised \nto preserve anonymity in accordance with our agreement with the organization.   \n16 On average over the twelve month period we had contact with the Tennant administrator fortnightly, \nthe Tennant manager bi-monthly, and Carewell staff monthly. This involved less formal unscripted \ninteractions, usually involving face-to-face contact but in some instances telephone conversations. \n 19 \nrelatively small size of the organization, this provided the opportunity to gain a wide \ncross-section of opinion at both managerial and operational levels. \n \n[Insert Table 3 here] \n \n While interviews were relatively unstructured, an initial interview protocol was \ndeveloped to ensure that evidence would be collected on participants\u2019 views related to \ntheir values, the work situation both within the organization and with others external to \nthe entity, and their experiences and opinions on the MCS.  Interviewees were allowed \nto freely explore issues that they believed were important. Interviews were digitally-\nrecorded and transcribed. Where this was not permitted we took detailed notes during \nthe interview that we wrote up on the same day. Each formal interview ran for \napproximately 75 minutes, although informal follow-up conversations involved many \nmore hours of contact. At least two researchers were present at all interviews to \nenhance data reliability and to maintain continuity with our contacts at the research \nsites.  It is claimed that multiple investigators improve the creative potential of the \nstudy and build confidence in the findings (Pettigrew, 1988).     \n We supplemented data from interviews and informal conversations with e-mail \ncorrespondence and extensive archival records (including access to internal MCS \ndocuments covering budgets, performance measurement documents, reports related to \nprogram performance evaluation, program management systems, Carewell\u2019s code of \nconduct and mission statements, publicity material, and government reporting \nrequirements). Additionally, we examined publicly-available data including information \nfrom the organization\u2019s website, other promotional material and evidence from \nsecondary sources including newspaper articles and other media information.  \n 20 \n During our visits to the organization we were able to directly observe facilities, \nworking conditions and, to a limited extent, the way in which those interviewed \nconducted their work.  Due to the sensitive nature of Tennant\u2019s work with clients and \nethics related to confidentiality, our research was constrained to passive observation. \nHowever, we were involved in informal interactions with employees during their breaks \nand leisure time where we were party to off-the-record nuances and general feelings \nabout ongoing changes. Also, during our visits we often observed work-in-action as \nproblems, emergencies and crises were presented for action.  Usually, observation of \nthese events and discussion with key personnel after the events helped us understand the \nculture of work within the organization.     \n In an effort to provide an external perspective to our enquiry we contacted a \nnumber of other organizations, which included State Government Departments of \nHealth and Justice, local health care agencies who had contact with Tennant, and other \nNGOs working in areas similar to Tennant. We also obtained information on Tennant\u2019s \nreputation from six individuals who had been involved with alliance partners, \nparticularly in the local health area. In addition, we spoke with individuals from locally-\nbased philanthropic associations, researchers on NGOs within a Centre for Health \nEconomics, and others researching NGOs within several different university faculties.     \n Consistent with Ahrens & Chapman (2004) and Free (2007), we employed \nEisenhardt\u2019s (1989) methods to conduct case research.  This involved arranging the data \nchronologically and identifying common themes and unique insights and also areas of \ndisagreement. We also used archival records, particularly mission statements, program \ndocumentation and internal MCS documents, to elaborate and refine our understanding \nof important issues that arose in interview discussions.  We then re-organized the \noriginal transcripts around key events and issues; and compared emerging findings from \n 21 \nour study with existing research.  Emerging findings and themes were noted, \nparticularly for further discussion and clarification as part of our follow-up interviews \nwith senior managers and a number of operational employees.  \n \nOverview of the organization \nCarewell has approximately 120 staff located across three divisions (the \nTennant Centre, Options, and Opportunities) which work to build a just society by \nadvocating for social change and promoting the health and wellbeing of disadvantaged \nyoung people, families and communities. Figure 1 outlines Carewell\u2019s organizational \nstructure. The three divisions, Options, Opportunities and Tennant provide services to \ndifferent client groups, while Carewell provides administrative services, strategic \ndirection and manages funding. The Options division provides counselling services and \nother forms of social support to young people suffering from mental health and drug-\nrelated issues. The Opportunities division is responsible for the operation of a long-term \nprogram for disadvantaged young people focused on skill development, education and \nsecure employment.    \nThe focus of our empirical analysis is the Tennant Centre, the largest and most \nestablished of Carewell\u2019s divisions. Tennant cares for people from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds, many of whom have had dealings with the justice system or have been \notherwise marginalized.  Its sponsoring organization is Carewell, which is affiliated \nwith a large philanthropic organization. While Carewell is the central agency for the \ncollection of funds, Tennant is also active in attracting funding for its programs.  \nTennant comprises 42 paid staff, including a manager, an administrative staff of four, \nfive program co-ordinators, and 32 case workers. Tennant also interrelates with a wide \n 22 \nvariety of service providers that offer employment opportunities, and housing, medical, \npsychological and social services. Operational decisions are delegated to Tennant.   \nExamination of documents and discussions with accounting personnel and \nmanagers revealed that Tennant has its own work-based control system designed to plan \nand monitor client treatments, often being based on professional issues concerning \nsocial work and psychology. Budgets are developed at Carewell with an administrative \nemployee possessing accounting skills located within Tennant. The financial accounting \nsystem allows costs to be traced to different segments of the organization and has the \ncapacity to deal with fixed and variable costing. It is quite sophisticated but is not seen \nas user-friendly at the operational level. Tennant\u2019s program manager and Carewell\u2019s \ndirectors indicated that Tennant has a major role in developing strategic initiatives; \nhowever, financial concerns are dealt mainly by Carewell.  \nTennant\u2019s external network comprises existing and potential clients, agencies \nthat provide services, other welfare agencies with which Tennant is competitive for \nfunding and new programs (some of these agencies become partners in joint programs), \nand government departments that are involved in managing the welfare and justice \nsectors and provide funding for new initiatives.  \n[Insert Figure 1 here] \n \nCase study findings \n We organize the case findings around the major themes of our investigation.  \nFirst, we use Bourdieu (1986) to help position our study of social capital and MCS at \nTennant in a setting where there is increasing tension between efforts to preserve \ncultural capital while attracting and managing economic capital.  We then consider how \nformal controls both assisted and hindered developing social capital, using notions of \n 23 \nbonding and bridging, highlighting issues related to interactive use of formal controls \nand enabling characteristics. Next we identify the important role of belief systems in \nsupporting bonding social capital, while at the same time limiting the development of \nbridging social capital. The final section shows how Tennant was able to use formal \ncontrols to assist in brokering alliances and bridging structural holes to help preserve its \ncultural capital. \n \nEmerging tensions between cultural and economic capital  \nA primary concern underlying our study is the tension faced by NGOs as they \nattract economic capital while attempting to preserve their cultural capital. Tennant\u2019s \nhistory and identity had provided it with strong cultural capital related to social \nwelfare (Bourdieu, 1986). The building of this cultural capital was reinforced by \nemployees\u2019 beliefs in Tennant\u2019s role and from a sense of common purpose based on \nthe ideals of providing welfare services for marginalized people.  A Carewell manager \nexplained: \n\u201cThe type of people who come to work here are interested in providing \nservice to the community\u2026pay levels in the sector are not \nhigh\u2026employees dedicated to these ends are attracted to the \norganization \u2026that\u2019s what generates commitment.\u201d \n \nWithin the sector, Tennant was also perceived as an effective service provider and a \nleader in social welfare. While all participants in the study were proud of the high \nstandards of professional service delivery, our discussions with managers of external \nagencies confirmed that Tennant\u2019s work was regarded highly in its sector. As a \nconsequence of these subjective reflections both within and outside the organization, \nTennant\u2019s symbolic capital was based on a perception of excellence in delivering \nsocial welfare.  Other forces related to managing resources efficiently, typically \n 24 \nderived from funding agencies and government, had not in the past occupied a \ndominant position. Tennant had not been open to ideas on accounting control to assist \nin the efficient use of resources as there had been no \u2018division of the work of \ndomination\u2019, or any apparent tension between those preserving cultural ideals and \nthose who might perpetuate objectives of economic capital (Bourdieu & Wacquant, \n1992).    \nIn its current context, however, Tennant, like many NGOs, is faced with \nincreased competition to attract economic capital to support its welfare programs.  In \nparticular, the intersection of several features of Tennant\u2019s operational environment has \nrecently created increased tension between cultural and economic capital. These \nfeatures are the drive for new public management (NPM), changes in funding \narrangements, and the nature of service delivery in the welfare sector with government \nincreasingly subcontracting welfare services to NGOs.  \nSenior management at both Carewell and Tennant stressed that funding is an on-\ngoing concern. Sources of funds are donations from the public, bequests, and primarily \ngovernment support for specific programs often undertaken jointly with other agencies. \nCarewell\u2019s directors explained that a unique source of funds has been a foundation from \nstakeholders linked to Carewell. These funds have been employed historically to cover \nshortfalls and act as a buffer to potential financial distress caused by budget overruns.  \nHowever, in recent years, Carewell has instructed its divisions, including Tennant, that \nthey can no longer rely on these funds to cover deficits, meaning that divisions are now \nstruggling to find sufficient funds to ensure that all of their programs can continue.   \nTennant\u2019s service delivery model involves connecting clients with other \nagencies that provide housing, employment, medical and social services.  Managing \nthese connections is critical as no one agency can adequately meet all the needs \n 25 \nidentified for program participants. Collaboration involves advocacy for Tennant\u2019s \nclients and advising and educating other agencies in how best to provide services.  \nTennant\u2019s manager noted that concentrated effort related to other agencies is \nimportant to ensure co-ordination and accessibility to services where resources are \nlimited and participants are easily diverted.  Additionally, Tennant often works with \nother agencies to submit to government joint proposals for program funding.  One \nsenior Carewell manager described the sector as follows: \n\u201cOh it's a pretty competitive sector.  So on the one level there's very much a \n\u2018let's work together' [ethos]; but on another level, the way government rolls \nout its funding causes competition with each other for scarce resources and \ndollars\u2026You have some wins and losses and sometimes you're not quite sure \nwhat drove the decision being made and, you know, there's politics \neverywhere you go.  In most organizations in the sector we work in, it is very \npersonality driven, they're very much about who knows who, what's the \nreputation of an organization - and you know a lot of organizations are \nsmallish so people tend to know each other.  So I think there's a level of \ncompetition but a level of goodwill and they kind of sit in tension beside each \nother.\u201d  \n \nAdditionally, interacting with government has become increasingly important \nas official agencies seek to identify key welfare agencies to deliver services.  \nGovernment is attempting to develop co-ordinated programs and rationalize \nresources. Tennant\u2019s manager noted favourable outcomes from these interactions: \n\u201cGiven our expertise in our sector we are in the process of negotiating \nwith a government agency on how to improve the delivery of services by \n rationalizing on the basis of community\/region-based approach to care.  \n This will provide advantage to Tennant but will involve reorganization \nand possibly disadvantage some other agencies.\u201d \n \nWithin this environment, attracting economic resources requires Tennant to \ndemonstrate to funding agencies and government its ability to deliver services \neffectively and efficiently.  In the NPM context, this has generated a need to employ \nplanning systems related to operations, and control mechanisms to ensure that action is \nconsistent with plans and that governance is maintained.  In the past, Tennant\u2019s \n 26 \ncontinued existence had been dependent largely on developing its cultural capital, \nwhich had enabled it to establish a strong reputation and link its clients successfully \nwith other agencies. Its survival now depends on developing and managing both \ncultural and economic capital.  As noted by Bourdieu (1986), these forms of capital \nmay be in tension when efforts to attract economic capital are pursued in ways that \ndiminish cultural capital.  \nResistance to symbolic violence at Tennant.  At Tennant we see echoes of the \nrole of symbolic violence exerted by economic capital over cultural capital, in \nBourdieu\u2019s terms (Oakes et al. 1998). However, arguably, at Tennant, we observe a \nsituation of resistance to the potential circuitous incursion of symbolic violence. \nSymbolic capital was squarely associated with the social welfare values that defined \nTennant\u2019s cultural capital and close bonding was part of this orientation.  Tennant \ndoes not see itself in the business of earning a monetary return. The aim is to generate \nadequate economic capital to maintain cultural capital.  We observed Tennant using \ncultural capital to support their submissions for funding, for example, emphasizing its \ndedication to humanitarian values to establish a dominant position in the bidding \nprocess for government contracts.  In this way, Tennant used its cultural capital to \nattract economic capital, but in a balanced way whereby its cultural capital would not \nbe compromised. As such, when there is talk about trade-offs between cultural and \neconomic capital, cultural capital wins out.  Importantly, when seeking funds or \ncontracts, it is cultural capital that is promoted, albeit within a proposal that indicates \nnecessary responsible outcomes and financial management.  \nWhile welfare values are dominant at Tennant, inevitably economic concerns \nimpact on Tennant\u2019s ability to maintain its cultural capital.  While the dominant focus \nof cultural capital concerns values of delivering welfare services, not all deserving \n 27 \ncauses can be serviced in situations of constrained funding.  Employing a rational \napproach to welfare delivery involves some form of formal or informal cost-benefit \nanalysis to decide on which clients to service. This intrusion of economic rationality \ninevitably involves not undertaking some worthy but expensive causes.  If these \n\u2018causes\u2019 to be neglected are part of the targeted welfare group, cultural capital can be \ndamaged and the organization risks losing its identity.  Clearly, a solution is to \ndevelop internal values that are more embracing of economic concerns. This may \nconvince Tennant\u2019s employees that the long term social interests of Tennant, and \nlikely their own work, will be preserved by managing more efficiently while \ndelivering on core values. This may occur, however it remains a challenge and it is \nnot clear that this will ever be entirely successful, particularly in NGOs (Kurunm\u00e4ki, \n2009).   \n \nThe interplay between formal management control systems and social capital \nAt Tennant the customary forms of control included informal meetings \nbetween case workers and co-ordinators, open channels of communication, ease of \ninformal access to the Tennant manager, consensus and participative decision \nmaking, tolerance of mistakes and consequent learning and sharing of lessons, and \nsharing of information between employees, particularly over client treatments. These \npractices were not based on formal processes, but are more aptly described as organic \ndecision and communication processes (Chenhall & Morris, 1995).   \nThese organic controls appeared to have been consistent with, and supportive \nof, bonding within Tennant. It is within this customary form of control that more \nformal controls were implemented. Our data indicate that formal program \nmanagement systems were employed in ways that were not in conflict with these \n 28 \norganic controls. In this section we report on how program management systems \nwere used interactively and the controls had enabling characteristics.  However, \nefforts to employ other formal controls such as budgets and performance \nmeasurement interactively were problematic and damaged bonding social capital, \npartly as they were employed in a coercive way. \nProgram management systems. The program management system provides a \nparticularly helpful illustration of how the interactive use of formal controls can be \nconsistent with customary organic controls where they are employed in enabling \nways.  Arguably, this enhanced the potential for the program management system to \nhelp internal bonding and external bridging social capital.  \nProgram management systems were part of operational management and were \nimportant in clarifying desired welfare outcomes and in sharing information about \nclients to improve treatment and administrative processes associated with these \ntreatments. These systems involved both scheduled formal meetings but also \nimpromptu gatherings and discussions, more consistent with the customary \nbackground organic processes at Tennant. The characteristics of these controls were \nconsistent with an enabling approach.  The systems were highly transparent, flexible \nand provided details of interdependences between specific programs and other parts of \nTennant\u2019s operations. Case workers indicated that these systems were critical in \nclarifying and communicating Tennant\u2019s purpose across the organization, in client \nselection and in monitoring client treatment. The information provided by the \nprogram management systems included confidential, privileged client information to \nbe used only within the organization.  Access to this type of privileged information \nenhances bonding and feelings of solidarity (Fields, Copp & Kleinman, 2008, p. 168).  \n 29 \nOur evidence suggests that these systems were well received. A Carewell director \ncommented: \n\u201cWe use formal procedures for \u2018assessment and engagement\u2019 of \nclients\u2026quantitative measures are used as part of case notes that are used to \nassess how individuals and teams are achieving planned treatment \noutcomes. These are seen as an effective part of operational employees\u2019 \nwork.\u201d \n \nFurthermore, the program management system provided employees with \nopportunities to identify strategic uncertainties and discuss solutions.  For example, a \ncase worker noted that discussions within a program management session identified \nthe impact of operational policies on employment needs of clients and the unintended \noutcome of a need for more efficient transport. This motivated discussion of the \nstrategic issues of how to optimally use existing transport (routing) and the relative \nbenefits of a new vehicle.  Program management is particularly pertinent to \ngenerating bonding in NGOs where planning and monitoring of client treatments and \nbehaviours match closely with the client\u2019s wellbeing and even survival.  \nIn addition to enhancing internal bonding, program budgeting has potential to \npromote external bonding across networks with agencies that share common values. \nSharing common values might be expected to lead to bonding between agencies and \nconsequent outcomes of alliance solidarity and information sharing. We observed \ninstances where individuals employed by different alliance partners had experienced \nclose personal bonding based on professional experiences outside their respective \norganizations. However, this was not translated into inter-organizational bonding.  \nWhile wanting to ensure organizational co-operation, some distance was \nmaintained to reduce the chances of alliance partners pressuring Tennant to change \ntheir preferred way of delivering services. This could compromise Tennant\u2019s cultural \ncapital.  In plain terms, while alliance partners all share broad welfare goals, Tennant \n 30 \ndid not want to get too close to, and bond with, its alliance partners. The advantages \nof the formality of the program management system and the quantification of \nprogram expectations were to bridging, rather than external bonding, by providing a \nmeans by which structural connections between alliance partners could be rendered \nmore \u2018objective\u2019 and \u2018trustworthy\u2019 (Free, 2007, p. 5).  \nWhile program management illustrated a reluctance to engage in external \nbonding, the systems were associated with bridging alliance contacts in ways to help \npreserve Tennant\u2019s cultural capital.  Program management systems as applied to \nproposed new contracts provided a way that Tennant could use the veil of formality to \nidentify and access potential partners and then broker alliances in ways that could \npromote Tennant\u2019s specific core values and operational methods.  In bidding for a \nnew contract, a program would be instigated with detailed information on Tennant\u2019s \ncredentials and expertise in providing service delivery, as well as time-lines, financial \nbudgets, performance measures and the potential roles of selected partners.  This \nwould form the basis for negotiations with potential partners and if the final project \ndetails were acceptable to Tennant it would then form the basis for a formal proposal \nto be submitted to funding agencies or government. Here we observed the way \nprogram management and bridging social capital worked in tandem to enhance \nTennant\u2019s power and authority in establishing alliances. We return to the use of \nformal MCS to assist Tennant develop alliances in ways to preserve its cultural capital \nlater in the paper.   \nBudgets and performance measurement. To attract funding and acquire \ngovernment contracts Tennant recognizes that it must be perceived as capable of \noperating in a business-like manner, of being economically literate and competent.  \nBudgets and performance measurement systems have been introduced recently in an \n 31 \ninteractive way. This involved face-to-face interactions at formal meetings where it \nwas intended to discuss plans, flag concerns and identify emerging issues related to \nboth financial and operational issues. These initiatives have not been successful and \nhad potential to seriously erode internal bonding social capital. \nAs we have indicated, at Tennant, effectiveness in service delivery has been at \nthe core of building and preserving cultural capital. Acquiring and managing \neconomic capital, while not ignored, were secondary and did not occupy the attention \nof operational managers. During our study we observed that this was particularly \napparent where, despite recent efforts, program co-ordinators had limited \nunderstanding of financial matters and the budget position. A Tennant employee \nnoted:  \n\u201cPeople who are co-ordinators never see these financial statements\u2026and yet \nthey\u2019re the ones that authorise the spending, so how do they know how \nmuch they can authorise?\u201d \n \nA Tennant program co-ordinator commented: \n\u201cAt the moment I wouldn\u2019t know what over budget is\u201d. \n \n In order to attract economic capital Tennant has attempted to promote an \nimage of efficiency and cost consciousness among its employees. A Carewell director \nindicated that government\u2019s desire for increased accountability has led Carewell to \nrecognize a need to push financial accountability down to the co-ordinator level. It is \nhere that we see evidence of a clash between pressures to be financially accountable \nand the belief that this distracts from the core activities of providing welfare services.  \nIn fact, apart from the program management system, formal reporting and \nmanagement systems are generally viewed as an impediment to spending time and \neffort on clients. A Tennant co-ordinator noted: \n 32 \n\u201cA lot of the more stringent reporting-type stuff actually does very quickly \nfeel irrelevant, or can do quite quickly. You can be sitting doing something \nyou need to get to (e.g. reporting on budgets), but someone will come in \nquite drug-affected, throwing a chair around, and all of a sudden you step \ninto another role, and, obviously if someone is feeling unsafe or something \nlike that\u2019s going on, you have to get to that as well.\u201d \n \nWhile it is not uncommon to see such resistance in many organizations \nundergoing pressure to move from traditional to more business-like cultures, there \nwas a view at Tennant that it was unrealistic to expect co-ordinators to have \nbudget responsibility and to develop cost-consciousness. One Carewell staff \nmember noted: \n\u201cWe cannot make accountants out of social workers.  That wouldn\u2019t be fair \nto them\u2026It depends on the individual.  Some of them are really into \nfinancial things and they actually know what they are talking about, and \nthey know their costs, their expenditure, their funding, but some of them \n[would say], \u201cI am a social worker. I look after Matt, and I look after John, \nand as long as I produce that, the rest I am not so interested in.\u201d \n \nThe potential damage to bonding from using budgets to increase financial \naccountability was evident in a confrontation between Carewell and Tennant.  Rather \nthan form a basis for monitoring the financial performance of programs, providing \nbudget information to program co-ordinators has led to a breakdown of bonding \nbetween Tennant and Carewell, with Tennant questioning Carewell\u2019s commitment to \nits operations. Tennant\u2019s manager argued that deficits reported for their programs \nwould have been surpluses if cost allocations from Carewell were excluded.   \n A Tennant employee noted: \n\u201cThey\u2019re [Carewell] starting to drive home the message that they are not \ngoing to keep accepting the deficit\u2026I don\u2019t know if they realise what a \nrisky thing it is for them to do that, because immediately people are going to \nsay the way we can balance it is not to give Carewell any money \u2013 they \n[Carewell] are on their way to endangering the golden goose.\u201d  \n \n 33 \nIt is pertinent that the budget information did not include details that we \nwould describe as enabling and thus more informed debate was inhibited. The \nbudgets did not provide information that might have helped discussions on how \ntensions between Carewell and Tennant could be repaired. While there were face-to-\nface interactions on budgets, the budgets did not have sufficient transparency to \nhighlight ways that budget constraints affected operations. The broader picture of the \nlocal implications of budget cuts on programs or of the role of organization-wide \noverheads were not disclosed.  The controls were not flexible in decisions linking \nfinancial and operational issues.  It is possible that more attention to enabling features \nand processes would ensure that budgets contained more information and would \nengage employees more with the design and implementation of the controls. This \ncould then be used for productive interactions and be more consistent with the \ncustomary organic controls.   \nThese findings provide a parallel with recent accounting research focusing on \nhybridization as organizations move from more professional modes to managerial \napproaches of doing business (see for example, Blomgren, 2003; Kurunm\u00e4ki, 2004; \n2009; Jacobs, 2005: Mueller & Carter, 2007). For example, Kurunm\u00e4ki (2004) found \nevidence that faced with NPM reforms in Finland, doctors sought to embrace \nmanagement accounting concepts, in a sense becoming \u201chybridized\u201d.  In contrast, we \nsaw little evidence of hybridization at Carewell, with program co-ordinators, in \ngeneral, being unwilling to embrace management accounting issues.  \nNotwithstanding these negative attitudes to financial controls at Tennant, it \ncan be argued that inevitably the organization\u2019s survival will depend on gaining a \nbalance between work processes that can deliver effectively on social welfare and the \neconomic resources to sustain this. Efforts to ensure the alignment of employee and \n 34 \norganizational values include recruitment, socializing, training, retrenchment and \nother methods of dismissal of unsuited individuals.  In the NGO sector, recruitment is \nnot easy with salaries at the bottom end of the social worker, health care and \nadministrative ranges. Also, selection is made even more difficult as the NGO will not \nemploy staff who do not present with values consistent with the core ideals of social \njustice.  The pool of potentially \u2018ideal\u2019 employees with a breadth of operational and \nfinancial skills is thin and there is reluctance to remove individuals competent at \nsocial work but who find it difficult to accommodate financial management practices.  \nSimons (1995, p. 134) notes that, typically, it is neither feasible nor desirable to \nreplace the existing workforce; rather, he suggests, that belief systems can be used to \ncreate emerging agendas.   \n  \nThe effects of belief systems on bonding and bridging social capital  \nThe application of formal financial control practices to enable Tennant to \nattract and manage economic capital had unintended effects of inhibiting bonding, \nthreatening the cultural capital which has been crucial to ensuring Tennant\u2019s survival. \nThis is an example of how the content of a MCS negatively affects bonding because \nemployees lacked identification with the aims underscoring the new formal systems.  \nThe issue of ensuring that particular values of the NGO can be sustained is not \nrestricted to addressing incompatibilities between financial and service delivery \nconcerns. More generally, NGOs face situations where core values related to welfare \nservice delivery can be potentially compromised from sources both within and outside \nthe NGO. This raises the general issue of how MCS can be employed to reinforce \nadherence to core organizational values.  \nSimons\u2019 (1995) belief and boundary systems have been articulated as a way of \nusing formal controls to clarify and communicate values.  Like many other \n 35 \norganizations, Tennant employed belief systems to communicate core values to \npotential employees during recruitment, and to reinforce these values to existing \nemployees and to others outside the organization. This involved an array of emblems \nincluding formal documents and posters, photographs, statues and paintings of \nTennant\u2019s patron in the main offices.  At Tennant, the mission statement is displayed \nand publicized widely: \n\u201cThe Tennant Centre aims to deliver quality programs in a manner that reflects \nthe social justice principles of participation, equity, access and respect for \nindividuals who seek the services of the Centre. The Agency and its staff are \ncommitted to the underlying value and dignity of every human life.\u201d \n \nSome argue that belief systems can add most value when used actively to \ninfluence employee behaviour in specific situations (Dowling, 2001; Mullane, 2002; \nMundy, 2009). We observed belief systems in action to help manage a potential \ndilemma common within welfare agencies.  This involves an inherent tension between \na case worker\u2019s values and those of the organization.  In NGOs that deliver welfare \nservices, such as Tennant, some clients present with backgrounds that involve anti-\nsocial behaviour of an extreme kind.  This can create tension and stress for case \nworkers as they align their professional work with their personal aversion for the \nindividual\u2019s prior behaviour (Clark, 2006). While professional training can prepare \ncase workers for this challenge, many still find it difficult to manage clients who they \nperceive as insupportable (Balloch, Pahl & McLean, 1998).  Disagreements on these \nissues, both between case workers, and between case workers and supervisors, have \npotential to erode bonding.  It is not unusual for case workers to resign from their \nworkplace due to an inability to resolve this stress.  Clark (2006) notes that resolution \nof this conflict cannot rely on the dictums of professionalism and suppression of \nindividual feelings; rather, values need to be continually revisited and reaffirmed.   \n 36 \nIt is here that we observed the application of Tennant\u2019s belief systems to provide \na focus whereby troubled case workers could discuss and come to terms with \nTennant\u2019s aim to provide welfare to all individuals in need.  At Tennant there is much \ndiscussion about the \u2018dignity of the individual\u2019 including those with malevolent \nbackgrounds, which is made explicit within belief systems.  Employing belief systems \nto work through the conflict between employee values and those of Tennant enhanced \nbonding.17  \nDominant belief systems appear to circumvent the need for boundary controls \nat Tennant. Carewell has developed a 40-point Code of Conduct which has to be \nsigned off by all staff and volunteers upon entry to the organization.  However, this \ndocument does not appear to have high visibility within the organization, with some \nexperienced co-ordinators claiming that they were not aware of its specific contents. \nTennant\u2019s manager indicated that the imposition of a code of ethics by the \norganization is not necessary because many employees are subject to professional \ncodes of ethics. This type of professional control further ameliorated the role of \nTennant\u2019s boundary conditions. An experienced program co-ordinator echoed the \ncomments of many employees in saying: \n\u201cI have been working here for many years and yes, I am aware that there is \na code of ethics but have never seen it.\u201d \n \nOur observations suggest that it is bonding, supported by belief systems, that \nhas helped Tennant to gain commitment and solidarity from its employees to work \ntowards effective service provision. Although belief systems are important in \ndeveloping bonding among Tennant employees, we also observed that the \n                                                 \n17 Clark (2006) notes that this process is bound to be uncertain, shifting and hazardous. However, \nemploying belief systems to assist in these processes does make case workers\u2019 and the organization\u2019s \npositions more intelligible, if not always completely comfortable. \n 37 \ndevelopment of such strong relationships can inhibit the bridging aspect of social \ncapital by restricting and limiting engagement with partners and other service \nproviders. As noted earlier, bridging external networks involving clients and other \nagencies is particularly important to Tennant.  \nDespite the importance of collaboration, considerable tension existed within \nTennant surrounding partnerships and the need to protect their values and operational \nmethods. In response to the issue of how much of a priority it should be for Tennant \nto share values with partner organizations, a Tennant program coordinator noted: \n\u201cIt\u2019s [sharing values with partner organizations] not, and I don\u2019t know that it \never should be.  I actually don\u2019t know that it should be \u2013 and I mean to use \nthe word \u2018should\u2019, because I think it\u2019s key for us to retain our own identity.\u201d  \n \nAlthough managers recognized that partnerships are critical, particularly in light \nof strong government pressure to form such alliances, maintaining Tennant\u2019s identity \nand values within such partnerships was the overriding concern. A program co-\nordinator noted: \n\u201cI\u2019m very involved in one particular new partnership with some other \npartner agencies (other NGOs) and it\u2019s quite clear to me that we run the risk \nin partnership of losing what we stand for, and what we\u2019ve always done.  \nWe find ourselves in partnership almost having to apologize for the things \nthat we need to hang on to and the things that define us and give us our \nidentity. And it\u2019s a really difficult position to be in, because you feel like \nyou\u2019re not necessarily bettering the prospects of the partnership but you\u2019re \nstanding up for what you represent within it, so it\u2019s a conflict.\u201d  \n \nWhile belief systems are important in communicating and strengthening \nspecific social justice values that help to develop and sustain bonding within Tennant, \nthe strength of these systems and the resulting effects on internal solidarity is the very \nthing that appears likely to potentially limit the formation and development of strong \nalliances and partnerships with other key entities in the welfare sector.  However, as \ndescribed below, belief systems, together with other formal controls, have a key role \n 38 \nin structuring external networks to ensure the preservation of the NGO\u2019s cultural \ncapital. \n \nThe use of management control systems to broker alliances and sustain cultural capital  \nAn important aspect of Tennant\u2019s efforts to attract economic capital is to \ndevelop alliances to apply for Government contracts. This is important given \ngovernment\u2019s active role in encouraging agencies in the sector to form such alliances \nto deliver programs.  Critical to this has been Tennant\u2019s strategy to structure alliances \nin such a way as to enable Tennant to gain power and influence and thus maintain its \ncultural capital. That is, Tennant aims to develop alliances that allow its values and \noperational methods to play a prominent role, limiting potential clashes with the \nvalues and operational methods of other organizations.   \nManoeuvring within networks to achieve power and authority by brokering \nalliances requires the identification of potential partners, and then promotion to \nconvince partners and Government of Tennant\u2019s dominant capabilities and \nmanagement skills. Identifying potential partners to ensure Tennant\u2019s dominant \nposition within the alliance involved scanning the environment to identify alliance \npartners with which Tennant has had prior favourable experience, but where the \npartners have had limited formal connections with each other. This has been described \nas a sparse network (Granovetter, 1983; Burt, 1992). Consequently, Tennant has the \npotential to derive significant power and influence through brokering relationships \nwithin structural holes (Burt, 2005), that is, by establishing connections between \norganizations not otherwise strongly connected.   \nTennant\u2019s manager and a Carewell director both indicated that Tennant has \nbeen successful in using its reputation and connections with government to influence \n 39 \nboth government and other entities in the network, enabling it to broker relationships \nin ways that Tennant views as being most conducive to service provision.  Tennant\u2019s \nmanger illustrated this process: \n\u201cWe are stepping forward and asking to be the lead agency in each of the \nregions\u2026That in part relies on a couple of things. One is the social capital \nwe have within this organization to talk to other agencies about who we \nare, what it is we provide and why it would be reasonable to think of \nourselves as a lead agency\u2026We approach organizations that we think are \ngoing to be complementary and they\u2019re usually around training and \neducation and housing, the things we do \u2026We have worked with all of \nthem before. They haven\u2019t necessarily worked with each other.\u201d \n \nConcerning the use of MCS to assist brokering alliances we identified belief \nsystems as important in clarifying and maintaining Tennant\u2019s profile to external \nagencies. Further, formal controls based around project management, budgets and \nperformance measurement were helpful in establishing perceptions of competence and \ndemonstrating sound operational and financial performance to government.  These \nformal controls provided concrete evidence of Tennant\u2019s effectiveness and financial \nviability. To ensure its dominant role in alliances, program management and budget \nsystems were used to identify and articulate which partners would interact in ways \nthat enabled Tennant to achieve its purposes. This would establish a network of \nagencies that might provide suitable services. Tennant\u2019s manager indicated if these \narrangements did not suit the partners, or partners presented a unified counter-\nargument, the alliance would likely be terminated. In this situation we see a role for \nformal planning as a tactical contrivance to identify the density of social networks, \nand to find situations where Tennant could broker alliances (Burt, 2005).   \nA manager described an experience that instigated this approach. Tennant had \nbeen involved with a major NGO that had strong connections within the network and \nTennant had not been able to position itself as the lead agency. As such, Tennant was \n 40 \nnot able to manage service providers to its advantage.  In this situation they felt they \nhad been 'swallowed up' in the alliance and had lost their identity, which was a \ncatalyst for the decision to broker alliance formation to exploit structural holes. \nAnother benefit of Tennant\u2019s ability to demonstrate good performance to \ngovernment over time is that it has been able to access potentially important \ninformation on government intentions to restructure the sector. Here we see evidence \nof the dynamic nature of the field within which social capital is being applied, where \nthe field is in flux as different entities struggle and manoeuvre to have influence \n(Bourdieu, 1993).  Through being able to access information on changing government \nintentions and priorities that other agencies cannot access, Tennant is able to act as a \nbroker to develop collaborative proposals with other agencies for submission to \ngovernment, further strengthening Tennant\u2019s ability to define the network to its \nadvantage (Burt, 1997, 2005).   \nEvidence on the way Tennant acted as a broker between entities within \nstructural holes builds our understanding of how power and authority over network \npartners can be developed. We observed how belief and other formal controls can \nhelp convince network partners that the focal organization should play a dominant \nrole in the planned project.  The efficacy of these controls can be enhanced when \npotential network partners do not collaborate with each other.    \n \nConclusion  \nIn this paper we used the concept of social capital to advance understanding of \nthe interplay between MCS and the development of social connections both within \nand between organisations.  By considering  the notions of economic and cultural \ncapital, and bonding and bridging we have shown how social capital can enrich the \n 41 \nstudy of how MCS can assist, or hinder, NGO\u2019s attempts to develop efficient and \neffective operations, within the context of the need to develop and manage economic \nresources while preserving their cultural capital.  Using social capital we can \nacknowledge the central role of developing social ties both within and between \norganizations.  By focusing on social capital, specifically the social ties involved in \nbonding and bridging, we can  better understand how individuals react to MCS, and \nthe implications for the connection between MCS and both economic and cultural \ncapital. Our case study of an NGO demonstrated how elements of a MCS can enhance \nand inhibit the bonding and bridging dimensions of social capital and how this is \nimplicated in attempts to develop and manage economic resources while preserving \ncultural capital.  \nThis study has examined the dynamics of the interplay between MCS and \nsocial capital, and, in particular, revealed how different combinations of controls are \nrelated to different forms of social capital. We show that MCS can help to develop \nsocial capital; however, when different control system elements come into conflict, \nthis can damage attempts to develop social capital. Our study shows how aspects of \nMCS (both organic controls and formal program management systems) can be used to \nenhance bridging and bonding social capital and help to preserve the cultural capital \nof an NGO. However, in our study, attempts to introduce formal controls, such as \nbudgets, were not successful as they were predicated on acquiring and managing \neconomic capital.  We noted that these systems were introduced in coercive ways \nwhere they did not enable employees to identify with the new competitive funding \ncontext.  In this situation, we observed instances where MCS inhibited bonding social \ncapital which had the potential to diminish Tennant\u2019s cultural capital. It was apparent \nthat damage to cultural capital was contained, to a certain extent, because of the depth \n 42 \nof existing cultural capital derived from years of the employees\u2019 commitment to \nTennant\u2019s core humanitarian values. However, the strength of bonding and the strong \ncultural capital inhibited efforts to develop an awareness and sensitivity to economic \nmatters, which arguably are necessary for NGOs\u2019 survival. \nOur study contributes to understanding the important and complex role of \nbelief systems in the context of generating and sustaining bonding social capital \nwithin NGOs. We highlighted how belief systems can be used beyond merely \ncommunicating values to employees and outsiders, and form part of the process of \nmanaging and maintaining employees\u2019 and outsiders\u2019 identification with core \norganizational values. We show how belief systems can concurrently help to develop \nbonding around core values of the organization; yet such strong bonding leads to an \ninward focus and inhibited openness to developing bridging with other agencies.   \nOur study also helps to develop understanding of the potential difficulties in \nemploying financially-based MCS within NGOs. We saw widespread evidence, at the \noperational level, of resistance to using more formal financial controls as they were \nviewed as a threat to effective service delivery. Conversely, formal program \nmanagement systems were well-received when employed to plan and monitor \noperations.  These controls appeared to map well onto the everyday work of \nemployees and clarified objectives and monitored client treatments. In NGOs this is \nparticularly salient as the proximity of controls to activities can have critical \nconsequences for client welfare.  These formal program management systems were \ncomplemented with highly effective organic decision processes which were employed \nwithin loose structures and open communication networks. We see this approach of \ncombining formal program management systems with informal controls working in \ntandem to facilitate internal bonding. Attempts to use financial controls interactively \n 43 \nwere not successful as the financial logic implicit in such controls was perceived to be \nin opposition to core welfare ideals. While interactive use of financial controls had the \npotential to achieve productive debate on how welfare and economic values may be \ncombined and reconciled, such debate was not forthcoming as the financial controls \ndid not have enabling features.   \nGiven the inevitability of the application of financial controls in NGOs we \nsuggest that their use would appear to require, as a precursor, a change in attitudes \nand values concerning financial responsibility and efficiency. It seems that financial \nresponsibility could be encouraged by developing an efficiency focus before \nemploying financial controls, and then using interactive controls to develop concern \nwith financial matters. While this may seem to be common sense, it does highlight a \npotentially critical, but overlooked, role for belief systems in shaping values and \nattitudes towards other MCS elements, which focus on values that may be perceived \nby employees as conflicting. As a first step to developing a concern with financial \nmatters, the formation and application of belief systems could emphasize the \nimportance of generating both cultural capital (promoting core welfare values) and \neconomic capital (with connotations of efficiency). Given acceptance of the need for \nfinancial management, MCS could be designed in ways to ensure that they are \nenabling and then be used in an interactive way to provide the forum for their on-\ngoing application.  \n Our study provides some evidence related to the use of MCS by NGOs to \nenhance bridging. First, both belief systems and formal financial data had a role in \nlegitimizing Tennant among alliance partners, funding agencies and government. \nThis was part of Tennant\u2019s struggle to maintain its identity and its cultural capital so \nas to attract the type of programs and funding that suited its welfare agenda. We \n 44 \nshow how Tennant successfully employed controls to help develop bridging and \nbroker arrangements between agencies. This was most effective when Tennant acted \nas a broker connecting agencies within structural holes (Burt, 2005).   \n This investigation is subject to several limitations. First, our focus is on the \nfunctioning and outcomes of a specific NGO, rather than on whether this NGO is \nmore effective than others that operate in the sector. It is possible that the observed \noutcomes could have been delivered more effectively or efficiently by other NGOs. \nWithin the scope of our study, we are not able to assess this. Second, while evidence \nwas drawn from interviews, internal documents, public material and some external \nopinions, in the paper there was greater reliance on interview data.  While we viewed \na wide array of archival documents, we were not able to reference these directly due \nto confidentiality.  Every attempt was made to gain information from a wide selection \nof individuals across the organization and to corroborate interview data with \nobservation of archival data. While we made efforts to corroborate our  field data, we \ndid not observe everyday operations in an intensive manner.  Consequently much of \nthe data is based on a rather limited number of interviews as opposed to indepth \nobservational data.  Third, while we were engaged with the organization for a period \nof 12 months and observed business over this time, some interviews were conducted \nduring times that involved the introduction of changes that had a strong impact on the \nindividuals. Their opinions may change over time. \n Civil society is undergoing considerable change as the success of NGOs \nbecome increasingly dependent on their ability to develop strong reputations to gain \ngovernment contracts and to receive funding from philanthropic organizations and \nother donors.  In the increasingly competitive environment, NGOs are being forced to \ndemonstrate abilities to deliver services effectively and effectively, with the potential \n 45 \nfor an increased focus on efficiency concerns to jeopardize the sustainability of their \ncultural capital. Consequently, it is necessary for NGOs to manage the potential \nconflict between generating social capital to sustain their cultural capital and employ \npractices consistent with the economics of welfare. The application of MCS has \nmuch to offer NGOs as they respond to these tensions and changes in the structure of \ncivil society. \n 46 \nReferences \nAdam, F. & Ron\u010devi\u0107, B. (2003).

This more \nbureaucratic approach may be \nincompatible with customary NGO \ncontrols and damage bonding. \n\uf0a7 While formal diagnostic-type \ncontrols may damage bonding they \ncan enhance bridging by \ndemonstrating NGO capabilities to \nBoundary systems: used by \ntop managers to establish \nexplicit limits and rules within \nwhich members can operate.  \nDelineate the unacceptable domain of \nNGO activity.  \n\uf0a7 Enhance bonding by clarifying \nunacceptable areas of activity. \nDiagnostic control systems: \nformal systems used to \nmonitor organizational \nUsed to describe NGO activities in formal \nplans and budgets .  \n\uf0a7 Enhance bonding by clarifying goals \nand cascading expectations throughout \nthe organization. \n 55 \noutcomes and correct \ndeviations from preset \nstandards of performance. \n\uf0a7 Enhance bridging by demonstrating \ncapabilities to engage in network \nactivities (Cooper & Slagmulder, \n2004), which may develop into \nrelational signalling (Lindenberg, \n2000) and goodwill trust (Tomkins, \n2001). \n\uf0a7 Enhance bridging by identifying areas \nof joint interest thereby reinforcing \nparts of the network (Mouritsen & \nThrane, 2006).  \nfunding bodies and alliance \npartners. \n\uf0a7 The formality of the interactive \nprocesses may be inconsistent with \ncustomary organic controls which \nmay inhibit bonding.  \nInteractive control systems: \nformal systems managers use \nto involve themselves \nregularly and personally in \nsubordinates\u2019 decision \nactivities.  \n \nUse of different formal control practices \nto focus attention and force dialogue \nthroughout the NGO. \n\uf0a7 Enhance bonding by encouraging \ndebate on values and future directions \nof the NGO. \n\uf0a7 Enhance bridging by helping managers \nto identify strategic uncertainties that \nmay provide the impetus to create \nalliances and other cooperative \narrangements thus extending networks.   \n \nForms of bureaucracy (Adler and Borys, 1996; Ahrens and Chapman, 2004)  \nDefinition of dimensions Focus of control Importance to bonding and bridging \nsocial capital  \nPossible tensions \nEnabling: design and \nimplementation of controls \nthat are consistent with \nemployees\u2019 mental models of \nthe work situation. \nContent  of controls: repair, internal \ntransparency, global transparency and \nflexibility (Ahrens & Chapman, 2004). \n \n\uf0a7 Enhance bonding by encouraging \nidentification with goals. \n\uf0a7 Potential to help resolve \ninconsistencies between customary \norganic processes and more \nbureaucratic approaches embedded \nin the interactive use of formal \ncontrols - a hybrid approach of \nenabling bureaucracy involving \nrules that are set, implemented and \nused organically. \nCoercive: use of \npredetermined explicit \ninstruction, rigidity and \nauthoritarian command and \ncontrol to coerce compliance. \nAs above. \uf0a7 Inhibit bonding as inconsistent with \nsharing of ideas and values that are \ncentral to the way that NGO\u2019s operate. \n 56 \nTable 3: List of interviews  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterview \nNumber Role \nDuration \n(mins) \n1 Business Support Director - Carewell 60 \n2 Program Manager, Tennant 120 \n3 \n \nActing Program Director - Carewell & \nProgram Manager, Options 90 \n4 Program Manager - Opportunities 90 \n5 Administrator - Tennant 90 \n6 Program Manager - Tennant 120 \n7 Accountant - Carewell 60 \n8 Program Manager - Tennant 30 \n9 Co-ordinator\/case worker - Tennant 30 \n10 Business Support Director - Carewell 90 \n11 CEO - Carewell 90 \n12 Co-ordinator\/case worker - Tennant 75 \n13 Co-ordinator - Tennant 80 \n14 Co-ordinator - Tennant 60 \n15 Co-ordinator\/case worker - Tennant 60 \n16 Program Manager - Tennant 75 \n 57 \nTable 4: Relations between management control systems and social capital at Tennant  \n \nTheme Specific practices Relations with social capital  \nInformal and  formal MCS and \nbonding social capital \n\uf0a7 Organic decision and communication processes, \nsuch as informal regular meetings, open-door \nmanagement policy, tolerance of mistakes, and \nsharing of information. \n \n\u2022 Open and supportive environment created by organic processes helped to \ndevelop and reinforce bonding. \n \n \u2022 Program management system used interactively \nto plan and monitor client treatments in enabling \nways. \n \n\u2022 Program management system developed bonding among case workers by \nhelping them to assess progress on client treatments and clarify and \ncommunicate purpose. \n \n \u2022 Budgeting system used interactively in staff \ndiscussions but in coercive ways. \n\u2022 Budgeting used to promote a focus on costs and efficiency and led to tensions \naround reactions to cost overruns and cost allocations, leading to a breakdown \nin bonding. \nBelief and boundary systems: \nbonding and bridging social \ncapital \n\u2022 Extensive belief systems, such as formal mission \nstatement, promotional leaflets, statues, \nphotographs and paintings of patron, core values \nused to promote ideals internally and externally. \nBoundary systems, such as 40-point code of \nconduct signed-off by all employees and \nvolunteers upon entry to the organization. \nProfessional codes of ethics. \n\u2022 Belief systems developed a high degree of shared values among employees that \ngenerated strong bonding. \n\u2022  Used to clarify and articulate values during recruitment to provide a basis for \nbonding.  \n\u2022 Belief systems also helped employees manage the tension between personal and \norganizational values, further reinforcing bonding.  \n\u2022 However, the strong bonding developed through belief systems subsequently \nlimited bridging with other agencies. \n\u2022 Little effect of boundary systems on social capital as strong clarity of purpose \nmakes boundary conditions unnecessary or at least redundant. \nMCS and brokering alliances  \u2022 Collection and reporting of financial data and \nKPIs to meet requirements of agreements with \nfunders. \n\u2022 Belief systems, program management systems \nand budgeting system (as above). \n\uf0a7 Use of belief systems, and \u2018concrete\u2019 data from program management system, \nbudgets and KPIs, to communicate and reinforced to external parties Tennant\u2019s \ndistinctiveness, reputation and prestige. This enabled Tennant to broker \nrelationships within structural holes where its values and operational models \ncould dominate. \n 58 \n \n"}
