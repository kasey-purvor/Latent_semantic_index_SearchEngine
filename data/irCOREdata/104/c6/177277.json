A \nmodel is suggested that analyses the Trusts in terms of these factors and then \ngroups them into four Trust types.  \n2 \n \nConclusion: The study highlights the massive and unpredictable impact of both \ninternal and external environmental shocks and how they destabilise Trusts \ndistracting attention from patient safety. It also underlines the importance of regular \nself-assessment of internal and external risks and awareness of context.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Service \nDelivery and Organisation programme (project number SDO\/92\/2005). \n  \nThe views and opinions expressed therein are those of the authors and do not \nnecessarily reflect those of the NIHR SDO programme or the Department of Health. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \nPatient safety is recognised as a major issue for health care organizations. Inquiries \nfocusing on catastrophic and avoidable failures in health care highlight a range of \nstrategies to address patient safety failures. Policymakers and researchers identify \ntwo approaches: one, a \u2018top down\u2019 approach focused on analysis of errors1 leading \nto development of performance standards and processes to attribute accountability; \nand, a \u2018bottom up\u2019 approach which favours the development of a patient safe \nculture.2 This paper attempts to unravel the contextual complexity of patient safety, \nand uses organisational change theory as a lens to analyse how content, contextual \nand process factors converge to influence patient safety. In so doing, it offers insight \ninto how health care leaders may approach the task of promoting a patient-safe \norganizational culture as they steer around internal and external hazards.  \n   \n \nOrganizational culture and patient safety \nDefinitions of organizational culture are diverse and contested.3  Some commentators \nview organizational culture as a variable capable of managerial manipulation4, while \nothers see it as a root metaphor or non-conscious, pervasive and embedded set of \nbehaviours that are unlikely to change basic assumptions held by organisational \n4 \n \nmembers.5 We posit that different micro-cultures co-exist and are contested within \nhealth care organisations,6,but that leaders may have a strong influence in \nstimulating a culture supportive of patient safety.7 This takes on board Schein\u2019s \ndefinition of organizational culture that clusters the many dimensions of culture into \nthree levels that relate to artefacts, values and basic assumptions, and \nacknowledges the existence of sub-cultures which may work alongside or co-exist \nwith the broader organisational culture. 8  \n \nThe patient safety literature highlights a range of cultural dimensions that appear to \ninfluence safety. These include: a shared priority for the safety of patients;9 an open \nand non-punitive environment where staff feel safe to report incidents,9 where \nreporting of incidents and near misses is a norm;1 and a just culture where trust is \nwell established and where there is a well established collective understanding of \naccountability for actions.10  \n \nBroader contextual and process influences on patient safety  \nA range of broader contextual factors appears to influence patient safety. For \nexample, Vincent et al.11 identify seven types of factors: patients; tasks; technology; \nteam; environmental; organisational and institutional factors. Similarly, Nieva and \nSorra12 identify the promotion of safety by management; the development of \nstructures for teamwork in and across hospital units; open communication; effective \ntransmission of communication; a no blame culture; adequate staffing levels; \ncontinuous learning; safety awareness; and hospital wide systems and processes to \nsupport safety. In addition, studies by West et al.13 also link the sophistication of \n5 \n \nappraisal systems, training and the percentage of staff working in teams to patient \nmortality rates. \n \nThe \u2018Receptive Contexts for Change Model\u201914 suggests that organizational change \nreceptivity may be influenced by eight contextual factors. These factors identify the \nimportance of how: (i) quality and coherence of policy should link to a broad strategic \nvision that enables both commitment building and linking strategic goals to \noperational actions; (ii) key individuals must lead change, with an emphasis on the \ndispersed and collective nature of their roles, stability of leadership and the \npossession of personal skills; (iii) long term environmental pressure is likely to drain \nenergy from organisational change processes and financial pressures harm morale; \n(iv) supportive organizational attributes are recognised; (v) effective managerial\u2013\nclinical relationships involve clinicians in management; (vi) informal and purposeful \nnetworks that provide opportunities for training and commitment building draw \ntogether \u2018top-down\u2019 and \u2018bottom-up\u2019 concerns about safety; (vii) managers set clear \nand specific priorities; and (viii) the organisation\u2019s change agenda should fit with its \nlocale.  \n \nSome prior attention thus focuses on identifying systemic causes of error and \ncultural attributes supportive of patient safety, but we argue that limited consideration \nhas been given so far to understanding how contextual factors work in concert to \nmediate and influence patient safety. This paper aims to address this gap by using \nthe lens of organizational change receptivity to explore the interplay of complex \ncontextual factors influencing patient safety.   \n6 \n \n \n7 \n \nMethods \nThe paper draws from a study15 which aimed to explore organisational culture \nchange and wider contextual factors affecting patient safety and staff well-being in \neight NHS acute hospital Trusts in England (referred to as Trusts A-H). Three project \nstrands explored: senior leadership; the well-being of front-line workers (nurses); and \na multi-faceted, multi-method organisational strand. The current findings are drawn \nfrom the organisational strand. The bulk of the fieldwork was conducted 2005-7. \nTrusts were purposively sampled and varied in terms of official performance criteria \nin relation to patient safety and staff well-being; size; status; and location, including \ngeography, accessibility and population served, as well as foundation (more \nautonomous) or non-foundation (less autonomous) status (see Box 1). The \norganisational strand involved comparative case studies of Trusts. Four Trusts (A-C) \nwere studied in depth and four in less detail (E-H). \n \nIn total, 144 interviews were conducted. These included: interviews with senior \nmanagers (Chief Executives of all Trusts or their Acting officers); others on the \nExecutive Board including medical and finance directors; staff directly charged with \npatient safety, risk, human resources and\/or staff well-being responsibilities; middle \nmanagers; and front line staff. Interview questions focused on issues related to the \ncontent, context and process issues affecting patient safety and staff well being.16, 17 \nChange content issues related to staff perceptions of the scale, scope, character and \nmagnitude of the cultural change. Consideration was given to staff interpretations of \nthe goals, vision, and understanding of the change strategy. Contextual issues \nfocused on identifying the influences of organisational structure, culture, history, staff \nwell-being and resource constraints on patient safety performance. Process issues \n8 \n \nfocused on clinical governance processes, Trust leadership styles, incident reporting \nand analysis, and systems and processes supportive of patient safety and staff well-\nbeing. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and anonymised.   \n \nLimited non-participant observation, both formal and informal, was undertaken. \nNine meetings were observed including meetings of Trust Executive \nBoards, Governance, Risk and Legal Services, Health and Safety, and senior \nmanagement teams. The researchers recorded their experiences and interpretations \nof the actions, interactions, roles, motives and perspectives of participants in a diary \nand in contemporaneous notes.18   \n \nDocumentary analysis also served to enrich understanding of the Trusts\u2019 \ninternal and external context. Trust documentary data included: annual \nreports, Executive Board minutes, policy documents, incident reports, \ncomplaints\u2019 reports, Health and Safety reports, and infection control reports. \nNational data were also collected, such as Health Care Commission Annual \nHealth Check information and NHS National Staff and Patient Survey information. \n  \nTrust performance was analysed using a range of data sources. Financial stability \nwas described in Trust annual reports and final accounts. Quality of care was \ncharacterised from Annual Health Check ratings. Staff well-being was interpreted \nfrom measures included in the National NHS Staff Survey (percentage of staff \nsuffering illness or injury as a result of work-related stress) as well as reported staff \nperceptions of well-being.  \n \n9 \n \nPatient safety performance was derived from official sources, and interview and \nTrusts\u2019 documentary data. Official sources included: measures in the National NHS \nStaff Survey (percentage of staff reporting errors or near misses); reported \nstandardised mortality rates; and hospital-acquired infection rates. Staff \ninterpretations of patient safety performance were derived from their reported \nperceptions of patient safety performance and their acknowledgement of patient \nsafety initiatives.  \n \nData collection and analysis were concurrent. Three researchers collected data, and \nwere independently involved in coding, analysis, cross-checking and comparing \ninterpretations and emerging themes. Transcribed and documentary data sources \nwere input into Nvivo 7, qualitative analysis software. The processual framework16 17 \nand the \u2018Receptive Concepts for Change Model\u201914   provided the sensitising \nconceptual framework to guide analysis. One mini case study (Trust G) served as a \npilot analysis. Concepts and key categories were interactively derived from the \nconceptual framework and emerging themes generated by the data.  \n \nResults \nCharacterising Trust performance \nBox 1 summarises the performance and contextual features of each Trust. \nConsistent themes related to: limited understanding of the meaning of patient safety; \nsevere environmental shocks affecting Trusts; reported cultural enablers and barriers \nto patient safety; reported organizational processes and structures supportive of \npatient safety; and staff members\u2019 perceptions of leadership roles and behaviours \n10 \n \nsupportive of patient safety. Boxes 3-7 provide examples from the interview data to \nillustrate each theme.  \n \nLimited common understanding of patient safety \nMost Trust staff failed to use consistent and explicit language when defining patient \nsafety. Staff spoke of patient safety in terms such as: \u2018risk analysis\u2019; \u2018incident \nreporting\u2019; and \u2018no blame\u2019. They also highlighted how definition of incidents lacked \nconsensus. Clinical staff referred to \u2018complications arising from practice\u2019 which \npatients regarded as \u2018incidents\u2019. Only one Trust recognised a formal patient safety \nstrategy (Trust A). Similarly, when asked to interpret patient safety, staff often \nreferred to \u2018quality of care\u2019 and \u2018quality improvement initiatives\u2019.  \n  \nEnvironmental shocks \nEnvironmental shocks which affected organisational stability were commonly \nreported as limiting organisational capacity to address patient safety. External \nshocks were consistently perceived as: reorganisation of Primary Care Trust (PCT) \ncatchments; cuts in PCT commissioning; and PCTs in financial deficit. Internal \nenvironmental shocks included: hospital-acquired infection outbreaks; instability of \nTrust leadership; and Trust mergers. Financial resource constraints were interpreted \nas affecting staffing. Staff reported that patient safety was affected by inadequate \nskill mixes and displacement of clinical staff to unfamiliar wards.  \n  \nBarriers and cultural enablers of patient safety \nStaff members suggested a range of barriers to patient safety: heavy workloads; \nstaff communication failures; failure to follow and document procedures; poor staffing \n11 \n \nlevels; limited awareness of risk; and priority to achieve performance targets. \nAnalysis indicated that more participative cultures with higher levels of staff \nparticipation in decision-making (Trusts A, H, C, D and F) were linked to better \npatient safety outcomes.  \n  \nCultural enablers included: positive staff attitudes to change and innovation; staff \nmembers\u2019 willingness to question; the existence of long-standing and high trust staff \nrelationships; and, positive staff attitudes to accessing and transmitting \norganizational learning. These cultural characteristics were manifested in: \n\u2022 strong involvement of senior clinicians in operational management and patient \nsafety initiatives: \n\u2022 senior leadership visibly supporting and prioritising patient safety; \n\u2022 focus on allocation of time and space for informal social interaction; \n\u2022 use of multiple methods of formal communication of Trust strategies; and  \n\u2022 examples of the adoption of innovative practices and technologies. \n \nTrust leadership \nStaff perceived that senior leadership behaviours that galvanised Trust staff were \nimportant in signalling patient safety and staff well-being priorities. These included: \n\u2018walkarounds\u2019; open Trust-wide briefings; and use of role models in championing \npatient safety and staff well-being. Senior clinical staff also highlighted how they \nemployed \u2018permission behaviours\u2019 or verbal communication that encouraged junior \nstaff engagement in decision making. Senior sisters or charge nurses, who were \nappointed as matrons19, played an important part as visible and clinical leaders that \nmade sense of patient safety problems, mobilised resources, and designed and \n12 \n \nimplemented solutions. In Trusts A & H Trust senior leadership successfully adopted \na hybrid transformational\/transactional style20 which appeared to encourage \nparticipation in decision making.  \n  \nOrganizational structures and processes \n Organizational structures and processes supportive of patient safety were \nemphasised in Trusts A, H, C, D & F. These included: processes and structures \nsupporting the use of multiple methods of communication; and structures and \nfeedback processes that linked clinical governance, risk reporting, risk management \nand complaints procedures. A range of practices was reported that supported patient \nsafety. These included: the use of story-telling and incident reconstruction to \ncommunicate patient safety learning; Trust-wide involvement in the investigation \nof incidents; creation of social spaces to encourage informal interaction; and the use \nof matrons19 to disseminate priority for patient safety, and to, follow up and diffuse \npotential complaints. \n \nContextual influences on patient safety performance: a typology of NHS acute \nhospital Trusts \nAssessment of each Trust in terms of these contextual themes led \nto the development of an interpretive schema and typology of case study Trusts to \nmake sense of the complex interplay of contextual influences on patient safety \nperformance at a point in time (Box 2). Box 2 groups Trusts as \u2018Resilient\u2019 (A & H), \ncapable of maintaining stability of operations; \u2018Adaptive\u2019 (C, D; & F), able to rapidly \ndevelop strategies to cope with major organisational shocks; \u2018In Recovery\u2019 (B &G), \ncoping with crises in a piecemeal fashion; and \u2018Conservative and Passive\u2019, (E), \n13 \n \nwhere staff lacked the impetus to involve themselves proactively in patient safety or \nchange.  \n \n\u2018Resilient\u2019 Trusts (Trusts A and H) possessed the highest number of \u2018change \nreceptive\u2019 factors14  which also linked to their relatively high performance for patient \nsafety and staff well-being indicated in their performance ratings. The organisational \ncultures within Trusts A and H were perceived as \u2018consultative, participative, \ndemocratic\u2019 and encouraging staff engagement. This confirms existing theory that \nthese cultural attributes may link to higher levels of performance21. Leadership in \nboth Trusts was also reported as highly stable. It is suggested that this stability \ngenerated predictability of behaviours and high trust relationships which supported a \npatient-safe culture. \n \n \nBoth Trusts had been exposed to some environmental pressure.14 Trust H had \nexperienced a merger and Trust A had experienced a reconfiguration of its PCTs. \nHowever, Trust staff did not to emphasise these environmental issues during their \ninterviews which may indicate that the leadership had managed to buffer any \nnegative effects. The Chief Executive\u2019s style of leadership was also characterised as \na mixture of democratic and directive styles, and reflected elements of both \ntransactional and transformational leadership styles20 , which have been linked to \nhigher levels of performance 21. \n \nThe data suggest that the receptiveness of these Trusts to change was also linked to \norganisational capabilities which supported innovation and knowledge \n14 \n \nmanagement22. Trusts A and H possessed complex, efficient and integrated support \nprocesses covering clinical governance, risk management and complaints analysis. \nLikewise, diffusion of knowledge and organisational learning across these Trusts \nwas facilitated by: open; multi-level communication and feedback channels; staff \nparticipation in decision making and a simplified incident reporting system; good \nquality relationships; stable leadership; and strong clinical-managerial relationships.     \n  \n\u2018Adaptive Trusts\u2019 demonstrated how strong environmental pressures had galvanised \nTrust leadership to become operationally involved in patient safety and infection \ncontrol strategies. As a consequence, innovative strategies were developed to \nanalyse and investigate incidents, and transmit best practice across the Trusts. This \nconfirms the links posited between increased innovation and extreme environmental \npressures 14, 22 during radical change. In Trusts C, D and F, senior leadership also \nexhibited transformational behaviours20 , such as involvement in team briefs and \n\u2018walkarounds\u2019.23 Matrons were mobilised19 as change agents to promote patient \nsafety. They possessed an ability to absorb feedback and intuit local problems24, \nanticipate  risks, mobilise problem-solving and then translate customised solutions \neffectively back to staff.25  \n \nCultural norms in the \u2018Adaptive Trusts appeared to indicate a shared and \nincreased priority for patient safety and an emphasis on accessing, transmitting \nand using organisational learning15. Hence, these Trusts were able to learn from \nerrors and effectively communicated this knowledge and insight via innovative \npractices such as \u2018table top\u2019 investigations (meetings convened by staff drawn from \nacross the Trust to informally discuss a specific incident). \n15 \n \nTrusts B and G, (\u2018In Recovery\u2019) had experienced major environmental pressures and \nconfirmed the proposition put forward by the \u2018Receptive Contexts Model\u201914 that such \nextreme pressures can severely distract Trust leadership and limit its ability to \nrespond to problems and change. Likewise, distrust between clinicians and senior \nmanagement resulted in limited staff engagement in incident reporting. \nSimilarly, environmental shocks arising from reconfiguration of PCT services \n(Trust B), and severe financial and infection control problems (Trust G) had resulted \nin poor staff morale and affected staff engagement in reporting patient safety \nincidents. Low perceived priority for patient safety also links to low performance \noutcomes for patient safety. \n \nThe Leadership was also perceived as failing to implement safety policy as the \nTrusts were overwhelmed by externally imposed change. Staff members were \nbusy, dissatisfied and unable to access training which would have improved their \ncompetence and awareness of patient safety. Failure to access training \n appeared to link to limitations in staff awareness of patient safety breaches \nand patient safety performance. This confirms established links between \nperformance and training.   \n  \nThe \u2018Conservative and Passive\u2019 Trust (E) appeared to focus on the achievement of \ngovernment targets. The high level of environmental stability reflected the \nbureaucratic structure which was perceived to be resistant to change and \ncharacterises the \u2018safe culture\u2019 posited by Wiegmann et al.26. . Strong longstanding \nrelationships also provided a buffer against stress and pressure. This Trust was also \nviewed as slow in decision-making, overwhelmed by change and unable to clarify \n16 \n \ngoals. This preference for continuity over innovation and change was also reflected \nin its failure to develop new practices and effectively transmit knowledge across the \nTrust.  \n \nDiscussion \nThe evidence presented here largely confirms the propositions of \u2018The Receptive \nContexts for Change Model\u201914 with regard to the importance of organizational \ncharacteristics that support staff involvement in decision making (Trusts A &H) and \ncontextual factors influencing organisational ability to respond to patient safety \nchallenges (for example, how financial environmental pressures sap organizational \ncapability (Trusts B&G)). The Model emphasises the role of senior leadership in \nbuilding commitment, articulating a clear change vision and demonstrating \ntransactional skills in translating policy into strategy (shown in Trusts A & H). Trusts \nA, C, D, F and H also demonstrated organizational capabilities in developing and \nusing networks to access and transmit knowledge and learning to improve patient \nsafety.  \n \nThis study has some limitations.  The detailed case studies generated some \ninteresting associations between organisational and contextual factors, and patient \nsafety performance, but it would be hazardous to generalise the findings. The \naggregated findings may belie the unique nuances identified in each Trust. The \nstudy is also time-limited. Multiple patient safety initiatives are ongoing and many \nhave been introduced since data collection.  Interviews, the primary source of data, \nwere predominantly with managers and staff responsible for incident reporting and \nrisk analysis, and to a lesser extent with rank-and-file clinical staff. Hence, they tend \n17 \n \nto reflect a leadership and managerial orientation. However, some members of the \nsenior executive teams were clinicians, and participants involved in risk analysis and \ninfection control were also clinicians. \n \nThe study extends understanding of the complex interplay of contextual and process \nfactors that influence patient safety, and the development of an organisational \nculture supportive of patient safety. A typology of Trusts suggests how: \norganisational stability, the behaviour of senior leaders; and the presence of cultural \nattributes and organisational capabilities supportive of staff engagement appear to \nmediate patient safety performance. Attention is drawn to how severe environmental \npressures can affect and threaten patient safety and staff well-being which then lead \nto staff being stressed, pressured and distracted, leading to further implications for \npatient safety. It emphasises how organisational cultural attributes and stability of \nTrust staff can mitigate these problems especially when supported by a collaborative \nculture focused on innovation and learning. Stability without these positive attributes \nwas seen to have a negative effect on patient safety and staff well-being. \n \nConclusions \nThis study highlights the importance of health organizations assessing their internal \nand external risks and awareness of context. It emphasises the need to secure the \ncontinuity of CEO tenure and to develop senior leadership training that includes \nunderstanding of change management. Key to this is the capability of leaders to \nbuffer their organisation from external environmental shocks. The study also \nidentifies how patient safety and staff well-being strategies need to be coherent, \n18 \n \nintegrated and marketed. Overall, it shows the necessity for cultures and practices \nsupportive of organisational learning and staff participation in decision making.  \n \nReferences \n1 Reason JT.
