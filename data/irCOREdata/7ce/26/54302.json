The rate of adaptation and counter-adaptation is constrained by the intensity of selection and its efficiency, which depends on drift and genetic variability. This leads to the largely untested prediction that coevolutionary adaptations such as those driven by sexual conflict should evolve faster in large populations where the response to selection is stronger and sexual selection is more intense. We test this using the bruchid beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, a species with well documented male harm. Whilst most experimental evolution studies remove sexual conflicts, we reintroduce sexual conflict in populations where it has been experimentally removed. Both population size and standing genetic variability were manipulated in a factorial experimental design.

Extreme examples of this phenomenon 3 \noccur when male reproductive behaviour harms females via traits such as toxic 4 \nsubstances transferred in the ejaculate (Chapman et al. 1995; Eady et al. 2007; Rice 1996) 5 \nor damaging intromittent organs (Blanckenhorn et al. 2002; Crudgington and Siva-Jothy 6 \n2000; Stutt and Siva-Jothy 2001).  7 \n 8 \nTwo hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of harm. First, the 9 \ncollateral harm hypothesis (Hosken et al. 2003; Morrow et al. 2003) suggests that harm is 10 \na side effect of adaptations beneficial in male-male competition (Lessells 2006; Parker 11 \n1979). For example, in Drosophila melanogaster genotypes that have superior sperm 12 \ndefence capabilities reduce female longevity (Civetta and Clark 2000). Alternatively, the 13 \nadaptive harm hypothesis posits that harm benefits males more directly because of the 14 \nreduction of female survival.  For example, injuries could deter females from 15 \nsubsequently re-mating and\/or alter female perceptions of their health status resulting in 16 \nincreased resource reallocation to reproduction. Theoretical treatments support this 17 \n\u201cterminal investment\u201d hypothesis (Johnstone and Keller 2000; Lessells 2005), even when 18 \ndamage decreases the re-mating interval (Lessells 2005). However, empirical support for 19 \nthese models is lacking (Hosken et al. 2003; Morrow et al. 2003). 20 \n 21 \nThe bruchid beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus) is a species where harm inflicted by 22 \nmales is well documented. Male bruchid beetles have a complex aedeagus, the internal 23 \nPage 3 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 4 \nsac of which is covered with spines that puncture the female genital tract during 1 \ncopulation (Crudgington and Siva-Jothy 2000). Despite comparative evidence supporting 2 \nthe notion that the spines are involved in male-female antagonistic coevolution at the 3 \ninterspecific level (R\u00f6nn et al. 2007), evidence for an association between sexual 4 \nselection and genital damage is scarce at the intraspecific level. Hotzy and Arnqvist 5 \n(2009) demonstrated a correlation between spine length and male success in sperm 6 \ncompetition across populations, but no such relationship was found in two other studies 7 \ninvestigating why male bruchid beetles harm their mates (Edvardsson and Tregenza 8 \n2005; Morrow et al. 2003). Here we use an experimental evolution approach to further 9 \nassess the potential link between harm and sexual selection. 10 \n  11 \nExperimental evolution is a powerful tool that can be used to assess the evolution of 12 \nharm and female resistance to it. This approach has been used to eliminate sexual conflict 13 \n(and drastically reduce sexual selection) by enforcing monogamy. Males evolving under 14 \nmonogamy should evolve to become more benign to their partners since male and female 15 \nfitness are simultaneously maximized, while monogamous females should become more 16 \nsusceptible to harm because selection on counteradaptations to reduce harm is relaxed 17 \n(assuming that female resistance is costly). These predictions have been supported in 18 \nexperimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster (Holland and Rice 1999; Pitnick et 19 \nal. 2001a; Pitnick et al. 2001b). Similarly, enforced monogamy in the fly Sepsis cynipsea 20 \nenhanced female survival (Martin and Hosken 2003a) and monogamous populations of 21 \nScathophaga stercoraria had higher fitness than polyandrous lines (Martin et al. 2004). 22 \nIn an experiment where natural selection and sexual selection were manipulated 23 \nPage 4 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 5 \nsimultaneously, Fricke and Arnqvist (2007) showed that, when reared on standard diets, 1 \nmonogamous selection lines of Callosobruchus maculatus produced more offspring. 2 \nRecent studies have employed sex ratio biasing, to manipulate sexual conflict and sexual 3 \nselection. In D. pseudoobscura, male biased populations (with more scope for sexual 4 \nselection) did not differ greatly from monogamous lines (Crudgington et al. 2005), and 5 \nWigby and Chapman (2004) found no difference in the male harming ability of D. 6 \nmelanogaster lines with different sex ratios. 7 \n 8 \nFollowing the publication of the first experimental evolution studies aimed at 9 \nunderstanding the role of sexual selection by manipulating the mating regime, Snook 10 \n(2001) and then Wigby and Chapman (2004) argued that altering the sex ratio or 11 \npopulation density can result in differences in effective population size, so that different 12 \ntreatments experience different levels of drift and inbreeding. Additionally, because 13 \nmonogamous lines often have a smaller population size, differences in population sizes 14 \ncan be confounded with treatment. However, while these criticisms are in principle 15 \nsound, they were refuted for the specific studies initially criticized (Rice et al. 2005; and 16 \nsee Reuter et al. 2008). More recently, Snook et al. (2009) raised additional concerns 17 \nabout inbreeding and genetic variation when population size is manipulated. The authors 18 \nstress that a lack of genetic drift and higher genetic variability could result in more 19 \nefficient selection in large populations. Beyond the effect of drift and genetic variability, 20 \ntheoretical models also suggest that sexually antagonistic coevolution is more likely in 21 \nlarge populations (Gavrilets 2000). Higher densities might favour more intense sexual 22 \nconflicts, due for example to interference from other males, through physical harm to 23 \nPage 5 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 6 \nfemales, seminal fluid toxicity or polyspermy (Arnqvist 1997; Arnqvist and Nilsson 1 \n2000; Gavrilets et al. 2001). Population size could therefore affect evolution via sexual 2 \nconflict in two ways: either because sexually antagonistic coevolution is more likely in 3 \nlarge populations, or because selection is more efficient in large populations (Robertson 4 \n1970). The later could result from the fact that large populations harbour greater levels of 5 \nstanding genetic variation and experience more mutations and little drift (Schultz and 6 \nLynch 1997; Willi et al. 2006). While there is evidence consistent with population size 7 \neffects on sexually antagonistic evolution (Gay et al. 2009; Hosken et al. 2009; Martin 8 \nand Hosken 2003b), there have been few attempts to document the relative effects of the 9 \npotential causal factors involved (but see \u00d6deen and Florin (2000) regarding selection 10 \nefficiency). Here we use a fully factorial experimental design where both population size 11 \nand standing genetic variability are manipulated to disentangle the effect of intensified 12 \nsexual conflicts from the effect of increased genetic diversity, in a context of reintroduced 13 \nconflicts.  14 \n 15 \nStarting with populations in which monogamy has been enforced for 90 generations, 16 \nwe reintroduced sexual conflict and sexual selection by allowing free mate choice and 17 \nmultiple mating. We established replicate populations differing in size and standing 18 \ngenetic variability. After 30 generations of reintroduced sexual conflict and sexual 19 \nselection, we preliminarily tested for effects of inbreeding in small and low variability 20 \npopulations. Then we examined whether genital damage evolved in response to the 21 \nreintroduction of sexual conflict (1), by comparing the extent of genital damage in 22 \nfemales mated to males from polygamous (conflict) lines compared to the monogamous 23 \nPage 6 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 7 \n(relaxed conflict) lines from which they had been established 30 generations previously. 1 \nThen we examined whether sexual conflict resulted in more rapid evolution in larger 2 \npopulations or those with greater initial genetic variation (2), by comparing the evolution 3 \nof adaptations to polygamy across our lines. Additionally, we assessed the costs of 4 \ndamage (3) by evaluating associations between level of damage and female longevity and 5 \nlifetime reproductive success. Finally, we tested the two hypotheses about why males 6 \nharm females (4): Are damaging males better at accelerating female oviposition or 7 \ndeterring females to re-mate (adaptive harm hypothesis) or are they better at sperm 8 \ncompetition (collateral harm hypothesis)?  We simultaneously tested for an effect of 9 \npopulation size and genetic variability on male manipulative ability (5). 10 \n 11 \nMaterial and methods 12 \nSTUDY SPECIES AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN  13 \nTwo replicate monogamous lines were established from an ancestral C. maculatus 14 \npopulation (Niamey, Niger) cultured on black eyed-beans (Vigna unguiculata) at 27\u02daC, 32 15 \n% RH and 16L:8D photoperiod. Each generation we isolated beans carrying eggs in 48-16 \nwell cell culture plates in order to collect virgin beetles immediately post-emergence. 17 \nVirgins (< 24h post eclosion) were subsequently paired and each pair was placed in a 18 \n40mm Petri dish and observed until copulation had ceased. From these monogamous 19 \npairs, 60 singly mated females were transferred together to approximately 400 beans for 20 \noviposition.  21 \nAfter 90 generations of enforced monogamy, polygamy was re-established in new 22 \npopulations established from the two lines by placing 60 newly emerged adults of each 23 \nPage 7 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 8 \nsex from each line on 400 beans. A third polygamous line was created by combining 30 1 \nmales and 30 females from each of the monogamous lines. In this crossed population, 2 \ngenetic variability should be greater, because 90 generations of isolation and drift is 3 \nlikely to have promoted genetic differentiation and some loss of diversity from the two 4 \nmonogamous lines. These three polygamous lines were allowed to expand exponentially 5 \nfor two generations, before we established 16 experimental populations. The crossed 6 \npopulation (with enriched genetic diversity) seeded eight lines at two different densities 7 \n(four small populations size = 50 individuals, four large populations size = 5000 8 \nindividuals). Each of the two other polygamous lines was used separately to start another 9 \nfour polygamous lines with basal genetic variability, two small (50 individuals) and two 10 \nlarge (5000) (Fig. 1). This generated four treatments (small population size and basal 11 \ngenetic variability; small population size and enriched genetic variability; large 12 \npopulation size and basal genetic variability; large population size and enriched genetic 13 \nvariability) each with 4 replicates. Males and females were housed together for their 14 \nentire lifespan in all 16 lines. We continued to maintain the monogamous populations, as 15 \nabove. 16 \nTo retain a constant population size and ratio of resources to beetles, we sieved and 17 \nweighed the newly emerging adults each generation and placed another 50 (for the small 18 \npopulations), or 5000 (for the large ones) individuals on new black-eyed beans. Small 19 \npopulations were provided with 40g of beans in a cylindrical container 10cm wide and 20 \n4cm deep, large populations were provided with 4kg of beans in a rectangular container 21 \n30cm x 20cm x 13cm deep. Half of the populations for our genetic variability treatment 22 \nare derived from each monogamous line.

We accounted 4 \nfor this difference in the analysis of longevity (see below).  5 \nTo reduce possible maternal and phenotypic effects, we standardized selection one 6 \ngeneration prior to the assay (generation 30) for all populations by housing beetles 7 \nindividually under standardised conditions - single mating and one egg per bean (this is in 8 \nexcess of what a single larva can consume (Cope and Fox 2003)) - for one generation. 9 \nPrior to beetle emergence, we isolated these beans in \u2018virgin chambers\u2019 (48-Well cell 10 \nculture plates, VWR International Ltd, Lutterworth, UK). Beans were checked every 24h 11 \nfor emerging virgin adults (generation 31).  12 \n 13 \nTEST FOR INBREEDING DEPRESSION  14 \nIn our experiment, the small populations are potentially susceptible to inbreeding during 15 \nexperimental evolution. Inbreeding can lead to inbreeding depression affecting life 16 \nhistory traits (e.g. fecundity and longevity) (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1987; 17 \nDeRose and Roff 1999) and competitive male mating ability (Sharp 1984). These effects 18 \ncould potentially confound our predictions (see below). We looked for evidence of 19 \ninbreeding depression in fecundity, lifetime reproductive success and longevity by 20 \ncrossing males and females between replicate populations and comparing their 21 \nperformance to matings between males and females from within replicate populations 22 \n(the potentially inbred populations). We assessed those treatments most likely to suffer 23 \nPage 9 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 10 \ninbreeding depression, namely the populations of small census size and basal initial 1 \nstanding genetic variation. We also assessed the large populations with basal initial 2 \nstanding genetic variation as this allowed us to determine the potential impact of 3 \npopulation size and initial genetic variance on inbreeding depression. We analysed these 4 \ndata using a general linear model including population size, crossing status (within or 5 \nbetween replicate crosses) and their interaction. Elytra length (a measure of body size) 6 \nwas included as a covariate in the analysis of fecundity and lifetime reproductive success, 7 \nwhilst fecundity was included as a covariate in the analysis of longevity. 8 \n 9 \nMALE OFFENCE AND FEMALE RESISTANCE: DAMAGE, LONGEVITY AND 10 \nLIFETIME REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS  11 \nBoth males and females are likely to influence the amount of damage suffered by females 12 \nduring copulation. To isolate the damaging effect of males from the susceptibility of 13 \nfemales, we used the two monogamous lines as testers. Four types of crosses were 14 \nperformed: (1) between males from the polygamous populations and tester females (male 15 \noffence assay - \u2640M\u2642P); (2) between males and females from the same polygamous 16 \npopulation (female resistance assay - \u2640P\u2642P); (3) between females from the polygamous 17 \npopulations and tester males (\u2640P\u2642M); (4) a control cross between tester males and 18 \nfemales (\u2640M\u2642M). For each assay, 20 crosses were performed for each replicate (x4) of 19 \neach treatment (x4) (= 1280 crosses).  20 \n 21 \nVirgin females and males (all <24h post eclosion) were paired and each pair (10 pairs 22 \nx 4 treatments x 4 replicates x 4 crossings) was placed in a 40mm Petri dish and observed 23 \nPage 10 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 11 \nuntil copulation had ceased. Mated females were then placed on 10 beans for 24 hours 1 \nand then moved to another 60 beans for the remainder of their lives. We measured 2 \nfecundity in the first 24 hours of oviposition by directly counting eggs laid. Longevity 3 \nwas estimated by recording female mortality every 24 hours. After their natural death, 4 \nfemales were dissected and the number of damage points (scars) in their genital tracts 5 \ndetermined. For 25 females we also measured the area covered by scars and found that it 6 \nwas highly correlated with the number of scars (log-linear regression, R\u00b2 = 0.68). Female 7 \nelytra length was measured as a proxy for body size.  8 \n 9 \nMANIPULATION OF RE-MATING AND OVIPOSITION 10 \nWe measured the ability of males to deter females from subsequently re-mating (male 11 \ndefence) by mating monogamous tester females with males from the polygamous 12 \npopulations and then exposing them to monogamous tester males (\u2640M-\u2642P-\u2642M). We also 13 \nmeasured male offence - the ability of males to induce previously mated females to re-14 \nmate - by mating monogamous tester females with monogamous tester males and then 15 \nexposing them to males from the polygamous populations (\u2640M-\u2642M-\u2642P). For each assay, 16 \n10 females were paired and subsequently offered a chance to re-mate, following 24h of 17 \noviposition. Earlier studies revealed that over 80% of females will re-mate 24 h after their 18 \ninitial copulation (Eady et al. 2004; Edvardsson and Tregenza 2005) but in a pilot 19 \nexperiment we found lower re-mating rates in our lines that were maintained 20 \nmonogamous for 90 generations. We thus estimated that 24 h is a time point at which one 21 \nmight be able to distinguish differences in female re-mating propensity between 22 \nPage 11 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 12 \npopulations. Females were transferred to a 40mm Petri dish with a new virgin male (from 1 \nthe appropriate line) and were observed for 30 minutes to see if they copulated.  2 \n 3 \nWe measured the ability of males from the polygamous populations to stimulate 4 \nfemale fecundity by counting eggs laid during the female refractory period using males 5 \nfrom the 16 polygamous lines mated to 10 monogamous tester females. Again, mated 6 \nfemales were placed on 10 beans for 24 hours and then moved to another 60 beans for the 7 \nremainder of their lifespan. We subsequently counted the number of offspring produced 8 \nduring the first 24h after mating and over their entire lifespan, and then used the 9 \nproportion of offspring produced in 24h relative to the lifetime reproductive success as a 10 \nmeasure of male manipulation. Because both female re-mating rate and last male sperm 11 \nprecedence are high in this species (Eady et al. 2004; Edvardsson and Tregenza 2005), 12 \nthe benefits to any additional stimulation of oviposition beyond the first 24 hours will 13 \nprobably be enjoyed by rival males and as such we did not assess them here. 14 \n 15 \nSPERM COMPETITION 16 \nWe used a standard sperm competition experiment - where females are mated with two 17 \nmales - to test the hypothesis that harmful males are more successful at sperm 18 \ncompetition. Males from the polygamous populations were competed against black tester 19 \nmales from a separate polygamous line with both mating to a black tester female. The 20 \nblack phenotype is a naturally occurring polymorphism and this co-dominant marker was 21 \nused to score offspring. Offspring sired by brown males (with black females) are 22 \nPage 12 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 13 \nphenotypically intermediate (dark brown body colour and brown legs and antennae) and 1 \nreadily discernable from offspring from a black x black pair (Eady 1991).  2 \n 3 \nVirgin black females and black males were paired in individual 40mm Petri dishes 4 \nand observed until copulation began. After copulation ceased, males were removed and 5 \nfemales were allowed to oviposit for 20 hours on 5 beans. Females were then transferred 6 \nback to individual 40mm Petri dishes with a virgin brown male from one of the 7 \npolygamous populations. We repeated this for at least 20 females per replicate (4) per 8 \ntreatment (4). For each pair, we recorded whether copulation occurred successfully within 9 \n30 minutes. After copulation with the focal (brown) male ceased, each black female was 10 \ntransferred to a 90mm Petri dish containing 80 beans and allowed to oviposit until death. 11 \nEggs laid prior to the second mating were counted (first 20 h), as were the total number 12 \nof offspring after two successive matings, and offspring phenotype (hybrid or black) was 13 \nrecorded. P2 - the proportion of offspring sired by the second (focal = brown) male was 14 \ncalculated as the proportion of intermediate offspring. The experiment was repeated at 15 \ngeneration 32 to increase the sample size. We accounted for this by including a 16 \ngeneration factor in the analytical models. Additionally, to ascertain confidence in our co-17 \ndominant phenotypic marker, we estimated the repeatability of our paternity estimates by 18 \nre-measuring P2 blind to the first measurement for 20 randomly chosen females. P2 19 \nrepeatability was calculated following Lessells & Boag (1987), and was high (r = 0.996). 20 \n 21 \nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES  22 \nPage 13 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 14 \nAnalyses were performed in R. To avoid pseudoreplication, we performed all analyses on 1 \npopulation means. We also used mixed effect models adding replicate as a random effect 2 \nand obtained similar results, but only the results using the population means are presented 3 \nhere. All traits (damage, longevity, fecundity, lifetime reproductive success and elytra 4 \nlength) were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, all P > 0.05). Additionally, 5 \nresiduals did not deviate significantly from normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, all P > 6 \n0.05), and were not autocorrelated (Durbin-Watson test, all P> 0.05), and errors were 7 \nhomoscedastic (Breusch-Pagan test, all P > 0.05). 8 \n 9 \nCost of damage  10 \nWe used a general linear model to test the effect of population size, genetic variability 11 \nand their interaction on genital damage inflicted by polygamous line males. Female type 12 \n(monogamous or polygamous) was used as a third factor. We examined whether genital 13 \ndamage evolved with the reintroduction of sexual conflict and sexual selection by testing 14 \nfor an effect of male and female type (from a polygamous or monogamous line) on the 15 \namount of damage sustained by a female, using data from four assays (\u2640M\u2642P, \u2640P\u2642P, 16 \n\u2640P\u2642M and \u2640M\u2642M). We also examined the cost of damage by testing for a negative 17 \nrelationship between damage and longevity or damage and LRS using linear models. We 18 \nincluded population size, genetic variability and female type in the model, as well as 19 \nelytra length as a covariate for LRS and 24h fecundity as a covariate for longevity to 20 \naccount for life history trade offs. To account for the difference in longevity between the 21 \npopulations of the low variability treatment derived from the two monogamous lines, we 22 \nPage 14 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 15 \nadded a third level to the factor \u201cgenetic variability\u201d (i.e. we replaced basal\/enriched 1 \nvariability with basal from M1\/basal from M2\/enriched).  2 \n 3 \nEffect of damage on re-mating, oviposition and sperm competition  4 \nHarm could be beneficial for males if it deters females from re-mating, if it accelerates 5 \nthe oviposition rate or if it provides an advantage in sperm competition. We tested these 6 \nhypotheses using generalized linear models with the number of damage points (scars) in 7 \nfemales\u2019 genital tracts as an explanatory variable. For re-mating and sperm competition 8 \n(P2), a binomial error distribution was used. We corrected for overdispersion using a 9 \nquasi-binomial model when the ratio of residual deviance by residual degrees of freedom 10 \nwas larger than one. The number of eggs laid by the female in the first 24h (between both 11 \nmating occasions) was used as a covariate for re-mating and P2, elytra length was used as 12 \na covariate for all three variables.  13 \n 14 \nEffect of population size and genetic variability on male manipulative ability  15 \nTo ascertain how population size and genetic variability influence the evolution of males\u2019 16 \nability to affect female reproduction, we compared re-mating rates, oviposition rate and 17 \nP2 between our experimental populations that differ in the level of damage inflicted by 18 \nmales. For re-mating, we estimated an index of male manipulation by combining the 19 \nassays of male defence (\u2640M-\u2642P-\u2642M) and male offence (\u2640M-\u2642M-\u2642P): male manipulation 20 \nwas estimated as the difference between the proportion of females re-mating in the 21 \noffence experiment minus the proportion that re-mated in the defence experiment.

For sperm competition, we used a generalized linear mixed 2 \nmodel with a quasi-binomial error distribution to test for the effect of population size, 3 \ngenetic variability and their interaction on P2, the number of offspring sired by the 4 \nsecond of two males to mate with a female (see Sperm competition above). The number 5 \nof eggs laid in the first 20 h and a generation factor were included as covariates.  6 \n 7 \n 8 \nResults 9 \nTEST FOR INBREEDING DEPRESSION 10 \nThere was no evidence for inbreeding depression in small and low variability 11 \npopulations. We found no significant effect of the interaction between population size 12 \nand crossing status (within or between replicate crosses) (Fecundity: F7,1=0.5 p=0.480; 13 \nlongevity: F7,1=0.04 p=0.837; LRS: F7,1=0.5 p=0.517). Fecundity and longevity were not 14 \nsignificantly different in crosses within or between replicate populations (Fig. 2a: 15 \nF9,1=0.9 p=0.360 and Fig. 2b: F8,1=0.01 p=0.909). Population size also had no effect on 16 \nthese fitness measures, suggesting that inbreeding depression was either absent or was 17 \nsimilar across experimental populations (Fig. 2a: F10,1 = 2.8 p = 0.125 and Fig. 2b: F9,1 = 18 \n0.4 p = 0.533). Lifetime reproductive success (LRS) was also equivalent in the within or 19 \nbetween replicate crosses (Fig. 2c; F9,1 = 1.6 p = 0.234), but population size had an effect 20 \nwith small populations having lower LRS than large populations (Fig. 2c; F10,1 = 8.6 p = 21 \n0.015). When the analysis was restricted to small populations only, fecundity, longevity 22 \nPage 16 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 17 \nand LRS within and between replicate crosses remained equivalent. These results suggest 1 \nthat population size influenced LRS, but this was not the result of inbreeding depression.  2 \n 3 \nGENITAL DAMAGE EVOLVES IN RESPONSE TO THE REINTRODUCTION 4 \nOF SEXUAL CONFLICT 5 \nFemales mated to males from the monogamous populations sustained less damage than 6 \nthose mated to males from the polygamous populations (monogamous males: 29 points of 7 \ndamage \u00b1 2; polygamous males: 39 \u00b1 2; F48,1=12 p = 0.0009; Fig. 3). However, the 8 \nsusceptibility of females did not seem to have evolved in the 30 generations after the 9 \nreintroduction of sexual conflict (monogamous females mated to polygamous males: 38 10 \npoints of damage \u00b1 2; polygamous females mated to polygamous males: 33 \u00b1 2; F47,1=0.2 11 \np = 0.675; Fig. 3). There was no significant interaction between male and female type 12 \n(F46,1=0.02 p = 0.872). 13 \n 14 \nDAMAGE EVOLVES FASTER IN LARGER RATHER THAN MORE DIVERSE 15 \nPOPULATIONS 16 \nAs there was no difference between monogamous or polygamous females in 17 \nsusceptibility to damage, we analysed the effect of population size and genetic variability 18 \non damage using all the crosses involving males from polygamous populations (\u2640M\u2642P 19 \nand \u2640P\u2642P). Males from large populations inflicted more damage to females (large 20 \npopulation: 44 points of damage \u00b1 2; small population: 33 \u00b1 2; F30,1 = 15.5 p = 0.0005; 21 \nFig. 4).

Furthermore, females from the polygamous populations tended to outlive 7 \nfemales from monogamous populations (M: 10.9 days \u00b1 0.2; P: 11.7 \u00b1 0.3; F30,1 = 4.6 p = 8 \n0.040, Table 1, Fig. 5). This was also reflected in the LRS results, where females from 9 \npolygamous populations had greater LRS (M: 69 offspring \u00b1 2; P: 78 \u00b1 2; F26,1 = 8.7 p = 10 \n0.006, Table 2). LRS was also influenced by an interaction between the number of scars 11 \nin the female tract and polygamous line population size (F26,1 = 7.0 p = 0.014, Table 2). 12 \nMore scaring in females from larger populations resulted in lower LRS, but for females 13 \nfrom smaller populations the association between genital damage and LRS was flat or 14 \neven positive (Fig. 6). Note that when we removed one outlier from the analysis (the one 15 \nsmall population with very low LRS and damage), the interaction between the number of 16 \nscars and population size remained significant (p = 0.028): in large populations, the 17 \nrelationship between damage and LRS remained negative but was flat in small 18 \npopulations.  19 \n 20 \nEFFECT OF DAMAGE ON RE-MATING, OVIPOSITION AND SPERM 21 \nCOMPETITION  22 \nPage 18 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 19 \nWe tested three hypotheses relating to the function of male-induced genital damage 1 \n(delayed female re-mating, elevation of female oviposition rate and increased success in 2 \nsperm competition) using generalized linear models with damage as an explanatory 3 \nvariable, elytra length and the number of eggs laid in the first 24h as covariates (for re-4 \nmating and P2 only).

Males from small populations with basal initial genetic variability were the 5 \nbest competitors (Fig. 7c, large population: P2 = 0.73 \u00b1 0.03; small pop. P2 = 0.82 \u00b1 6 \n0.02, F29,1 = 9.9 p = 0.004; enriched variability population: P2 = 0.75 \u00b1 0.03; basal 7 \nvariability: P2 = 0.81 \u00b1 0.02, F29,1 = 4.8 p = 0.037; Table 5).  8 \n 9 \n 10 \nDiscussion 11 \nWhile most other experimental evolution studies have investigated the consequences of 12 \nremoving sexual conflict, this is the first that has reintroduced conflict into experimental 13 \npopulations and assessed the microevolutionary consequences. After 90 generations of 14 \nmonogamy, the reintroduction of sexual selection and sexual conflict for 30 generations 15 \nresulted in the evolution of more damaging males. However, there was no evidence that 16 \nfemale susceptibility to this damage (frequency of scaring) evolved during this time. In 17 \nspite of this, the response of females to damage did evolve, with females evolving under 18 \npolygamy typically having greater LRS and longevity at any given level of damage. 19 \nFurthermore, large population size rather than high initial genetic variation allowed males 20 \nto evolve faster and become more harmful. In addition, we provide evidence that genital 21 \ndamage is costly for females. It unequivocally reduced female longevity and tended to 22 \nreduce lifetime reproductive success, although this latter effect was complicated by an 23 \nPage 20 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 21 \ninteraction with population size (see discussion below). Overall, these results suggest that 1 \nsexual conflicts favours males that inflict costly genital damage to females and that the 2 \nevolution of harm was more pronounced in large populations, either because selection 3 \nwas more efficient or because large population size intensified sexual conflicts and 4 \nfavoured sexually antagonistic coevolution. This implies that sexual selection creates 5 \nconditions where males benefit from harming females in C. maculatus.  6 \n 7 \nMean damage levels were not associated with female oviposition rate or propensity to 8 \nre-mate. Our results thus provide no support for the adaptive harm hypothesis. This is in 9 \nagreement with previous work: Edvardsson and Tregenza (2005) manipulated copulation 10 \nduration to elevate female damage (Crudgington 2001) and also found no benefits to 11 \nharming males via delayed re-mating or increased rate of offspring production. 12 \nConsequently, and despite theoretical support, there is still no empirical evidence for the 13 \nadaptive harm hypothesis, whether the mechanism involved is terminal investment or 14 \ndelayed re-mating (Edvardsson and Tregenza 2005; Hosken et al. 2003; Morrow et al. 15 \n2003), and our results serve to reinforce this. Males from populations with basal genetic 16 \nvariability were better at stimulating female oviposition in the first 24 hours. This could 17 \nbe because favourable gene combinations were broken up by mixing of the two 18 \nmonogamous lines to create the populations with enriched genetic variability, although 19 \nmore work is needed to determine whether epistatic interactions can explain this finding.    20 \n 21 \nIf harm does not benefit males directly, it could be a side-effect of some other male 22 \nadaptation to male-male competition (the collateral harm hypothesis), with the obvious 23 \nPage 21 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 22 \ncandidate being sperm competitive ability. However, we found no evidence supporting 1 \nthe idea that males from more damaging populations are more successful in sperm 2 \ncompetition. P2 is a composite trait that is likely to be influenced by an unknown number 3 \nof male derived chemicals and behaviours, so that the prediction of the effect of 4 \npopulation size might be less straightforward than for simpler traits such as genital 5 \ndamage. Nevertheless, in the dung fly S. cynipsea more damaging males were not more 6 \ncompetitive (Teuschl et al. 2007) and our findings are in agreement with results from 7 \nEdvardsson and Tregenza (2005) who failed to find an effect of damage on P2. In 8 \ncontrast, Hotzy and Arnqvist (2009) found that across 13 geographically distinct 9 \npopulations of C. maculatus, male genital armature and the harm males inflict upon 10 \nfemales were positively correlated with male success in sperm competition. This 11 \ndiscrepancy between C. maculatus studies could result from the fact that the balance 12 \nbetween the advantage in sperm competition and the cost of harming females is 13 \n\u201ccontingent upon mating system, female life histories and sperm competition regime\u201d 14 \n(Hotzy and Arnqvist 2009), which may differ when looking within rather than across 15 \npopulations, and certainly could differ across studies. Our results, in conjunction with 16 \nEdvardsson\u2019s (2005), suggest that the damage inflicted by the spines is not associated 17 \nwith male success in sperm competition, but the damage they inflict did evolve after only 18 \n30 generations of restored polygamy. Perhaps a direct measure of spininess would be 19 \nmore revealing (e.g. Hotzy & Arnqvist, 2009), but perhaps the spines serve other 20 \npurposes too, such as anchoring males firmly during copulation (Edvardsson and 21 \nTregenza 2005). Using spines as an anchor could be beneficial for males if female 22 \nPage 22 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 23 \nkicking behaviour was a way to exert mate choice or to avoid being dislodged by 1 \ncompeting males before ejaculate transfer (Simmons 2001).  2 \n 3 \nLike the damage inflicted by males which evolved after 30 generations in our 4 \npolygamous lines, females have also evolved resistance to harm. It is interesting that the 5 \nnumber of scars inflicted by males did not differ in females evolving under polygamy or 6 \nmonogamy, but the effects did. Damage inflicted by males could increase female 7 \ninvestment in immunocapacity, as has been suggested in other insects (Reinhardt and 8 \nSiva-Jothy 2007). As a result, the LRS and longevity of females evolving under 9 \npolygamy were on average higher. Our longevity results are straightforward: increased 10 \ndamage leads to reduced longevity and females from polygamous populations always live 11 \nlonger than monogamous females at any given level of damage. Similarly, LRS of 12 \nfemales from monogamous populations always tended to be lower across damage levels. 13 \nNevertheless, LRS results are somewhat more complicated in that the damage effect only 14 \nshows up in an interaction with the population size of the male. When males are from 15 \nlarger populations, more damage equates to lower LRS, but when males are from smaller 16 \npopulations more damage does not reduce LRS. This could reflect a lower cost per scar 17 \nof male damage in small populations, coupled with lower numbers of scars. Only males 18 \nfrom large populations seem to have evolved beyond a threshold where damage becomes 19 \ncostly (in terms of LRS). It is unlikely that the lack of cost in small populations is due to 20 \nhigher female resistance because neither monogamous nor polygamous females suffered 21 \nreduced LRS when mated to males from small populations. Greater sensitivity to damage 22 \nin large populations (as suggested by this interaction effect of damage and population size 23 \nPage 23 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 24 \non LRS) is consistent with more intense sexual conflicts and sexually antagonistic 1 \ncoevolution in large populations: as females evolve resistance to male damage, 2 \nantagonistic coevolution will favour males that inflict more harm. If coevolution is more 3 \nlikely to happen in large populations, we expect more harmful males (as observed: large 4 \nmales inflict more scars), but also more resistant females (higher LRS in large 5 \npopulations), which in return escalates towards more costly damage. These findings are 6 \ngenerally consistent with a previous comparative analysis within the seed beetles 7 \n(Coleoptera: Bruchidae) which also provided evidence for male-female coevolution. In 8 \nspecies where males had evolved more harmful genitalia, females had evolved a more 9 \nrobust copulatory tract (R\u00f6nn et al. 2007). This observation is congruent with sexually 10 \nantagonistic coevolution, which we also found within our group of experimental 11 \npopulations, and experimental evolution of similar durations has documented evolution in 12 \nfemale resistance\/susceptibility in other taxa (Martin and Hosken 2003a).  13 \n 14 \nDespite manipulating population size for 30 generations, we found no evidence for 15 \ninbreeding depression in smaller populations. This could result from purging of 16 \ndeleterious mutations over the 90 generations of monogamy when population size was 17 \nrelatively small (between 100 and 150 individuals for each of the two monogamous 18 \nlines), assuming that inbreeding depression is primarily due to the expression of 19 \ndeleterious recessives and not to loss of heterozygosity in C. maculatus. Alternatively, 20 \npopulation sizes of this order may escape serious inbreeding over this time frame. Recent 21 \nresults suggest that the spectrum of deleterious mutations contains a high proportion of 22 \nvery small effect mutation (<<1%) (Estes et al. 2004) such that even large finite 23 \nPage 24 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 25 \npopulations will gradually accumulate deleterious recessive alleles, but such small effects 1 \nmay not be detectable over the 30 generations of our study. Since it appears that the lower 2 \nLRS of our small populations was not due to inbreeding depression, it must have arisen 3 \nfrom another property of small population sizes. The potential alternatives are the 4 \nindependent fixation of mutations that are not associated with inbreeding depression, 5 \nsuch as dominant mutations. These may accumulate due to stronger drift, a lower number 6 \nof new mutations resulting in lower genetic variability to fuel evolutionary change, or 7 \nless intense conflicts between males and females reducing the strength of sexual 8 \nselection. The effects of genetic drift are taken into account by using replicates for each 9 \ntreatment: a major role of drift seems unlikely given that the responses in all replicate 10 \npopulations were in the same direction. Alternatively, the evolution of small populations 11 \ncould have been constrained by the lack of genetic variability. We designed our 12 \nexperimental to disentangle the effect of population size from that of genetic variability: 13 \nif the higher genetic variability in large populations was crucial for the observed 14 \nmicroevolution, we would expect to see a significant effect of initial genetic variability as 15 \nwell as an effect of population size, which we did not. This argues against the hypothesis 16 \nthat the large populations evolved faster because of their higher standing genetic 17 \nvariability. It is worth noting that our design relies on the assumption that genetic 18 \nvariability is indeed higher in the crossed populations (with enriched genetic variability) 19 \nthan in the two monogamous lines. However, it does seem likely that genetic variation 20 \nwill be structured predominantly between, rather than within lines after 90 generations of 21 \nisolation at a relatively small population size. The lack of inbreeding effects observed 22 \ncould slightly weaken this assumption, unless it results from an efficient purge of 23 \nPage 25 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 26 \ndeleterious mutations, as suggested above. Three broad explanations therefore remain for 1 \nthe patterns we detect: (1) larger populations experience a larger number of new 2 \nmutations; (2) selection is more efficient in large populations; (3) sexual selection 3 \n(including that driven by sexual conflict) is more intense in larger populations and 4 \nsexually antagonistic coevolution is favoured, as discussed in the Introduction. Although 5 \nour population sizes are sufficiently large for us to expect new mutations, some of which 6 \nmay affect conflict adaptations, 30 generations is a short time for such new mutations to 7 \nbecome fixed. Hence the most likely explanation for the patterns we observe seems to be 8 \nthe potential for larger populations to evolve faster through an increased intensity of 9 \nsexual conflicts combined with more efficient selection with larger effective size 10 \n(Robertson 1970). This is in accordance with theoretical models predicting that sexually 11 \nantagonistic coevolution is more likely in large populations (Gavrilets 2000; Gavrilets et 12 \nal. 2001). 13 \n 14 \nOur experimental design manipulated population size and standing genetic variability 15 \nsimultaneously and independently. It thus contributes empirical data relevant to debates 16 \non the effect of population size and inbreeding in experimental evolution, in particular 17 \nexperimental sexual selection. Effective population size is a key parameter in these 18 \nexperimental evolution studies, firstly because the experimental manipulation of mating 19 \nsystems or sex ratio can lead to different effective population sizes between treatments 20 \nand confound effects (Snook et al. 2009). Secondly, small populations may lack the 21 \ninflux of new beneficial mutations, but slightly deleterious mutations are more likely to 22 \nget fixed. Finally, small populations suffer less intense conflicts. Consequently, effective 23 \nPage 26 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 27 \npopulation size can have a major influence on the outcome of experimental evolution 1 \n(Martin and Hosken 2003a). For example, our experiment suggests that some 2 \nevolutionary trajectories might only occur if effective population size is sufficiently large. 3 \nSimilarly, Reuter et al. (2008) showed that predicted patterns of sexual selection can be 4 \nconstrained by low effective population size. \u00d6deen and Florin (2000) further suggested 5 \nthat low effective population size could constrain the evolution of assortative mating and 6 \nthereby limit the power of experimental tests of sympatric or parapatric speciation. 7 \nMoreover, sexual selection itself changes effective population size and as the intensity of 8 \nselection increases and male mating success becomes more skewed, populations 9 \nexperiencing sexual selection will have smaller effective population sizes. Classically, 10 \neffective population size is estimated as (4nmnf)\/(nm + nf), where nm is male number and 11 \nnf is female number (Hartl 2000). If the number of males contributing genes to offspring 12 \nis low, then the effective population size is also reduced (assuming that nf is constant). As 13 \na result, we suggest that attempting to manipulate population size in order to remove this 14 \nfeature of sexual selection (Snook et al. 2009) is only justified where there is an explicit 15 \naim to focus on other effects of selection. Where this is not the case we suggest that 16 \nmaintaining large census sizes when possible is the best approach, if only because 17 \nselection is always more efficient in large populations (Willi et al. 2006). In particular, it 18 \ncan be misleading to focus on maintaining equal effective population sizes if the 19 \nincreased work load and\/or limited space constrain replicates to small census size.  20 \n 21 \nIn conclusion, this study is the first attempt at reversing experimental evolution under 22 \nsexual conflicts.

It seems unlikely that the aedeagal spines which damage females evolved solely 4 \nto harm, and further research is needed to assess whether damage is associated with 5 \nbenefits during non-sperm competition forms of male-male competition in these 6 \npopulations. Finally, population size affected the evolutionary responses we detected, but 7 \nnot via an inbreeding effect, suggesting sexual selection was more effective in our larger 8 \npopulations.   9 \nPage 28 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 29 \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nWe would like to thank A.

Diagram of the experimental design. 90 generations of relaxed sexual selection \nand sexual conflicts (monogamy, in grey) was followed by 30 generations of restored \npolygamy (in black). In parallel, the two monogamous lines were maintained to be used \nas testers. At generation 90, the two monogamous lines were crossed. Generations 91 and \n92 were population expansion. At generation 92, the four treatments were set up by \nmanipulating population size (large or small) and using the enhanced genetic variability \nof the crossed line to form four treatments: large population size enriched genetic \nvariability, large population size basal genetic variability, small population size enriched \ngenetic variability and small population size basal genetic variability, with four replicates \nfor each treatment (16 lines in total). All lines were standardized for mating rate and \nlarval density at generation 122 and 123.  \n \nFigure 2. Test of the effect of inbreeding in the experimental lines with low genetic \nvariability, small or large population size. Inbreeding depression was assessed in terms of \n(a) fecundity (number of eggs laid in the first 24 hours), (b) longevity (days) or (c) \nlifetime reproductive success (total number of offspring that emerged). Bars and error \nbars stand for means and standard errors respectively. \n \nFigure 3.

The rate of adaptation 14 \ndepends on the intensity of selection and its efficiency, which depends on drift and 15 \ngenetic variability. This leads to the largely untested prediction that coevolutionary 16 \nadaptations such as those driven by sexual conflict should evolve faster in large 17 \npopulations. We tested this prediction using the bruchid beetle Callosobruchus 18 \nmaculatus, a species where harm inflicted by males is well documented. Whilst most 19 \nexperimental evolution studies remove sexual conflict, we reintroduced it in populations 20 \nwhere it had been experimentally removed. Both population size and standing genetic 21 \nvariability were manipulated in a factorial experimental design.

Extreme examples of this phenomenon 3 \noccur when male reproductive behaviour harms females via traits such as toxic 4 \nsubstances transferred in the ejaculate (Chapman et al. 1995; Eady et al. 2007; Rice 1996) 5 \nor damaging intromittent organs (Blanckenhorn et al. 2002; Crudgington and Siva-Jothy 6 \n2000; Stutt and Siva-Jothy 2001).  7 \n 8 \nTwo hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of harm. First, the 9 \ncollateral harm hypothesis (Hosken et al. 2003; Morrow et al. 2003) suggests that harm is 10 \na side effect of adaptations beneficial in male-male competition (Lessells 2006; Parker 11 \n1979). For example, in Drosophila melanogaster genotypes that have superior sperm 12 \ndefence capabilities reduce female longevity (Civetta and Clark 2000). Alternatively, the 13 \nadaptive harm hypothesis posits that harm benefits males more directly because of the 14 \nreduction of female survival.  For example, injuries could deter females from 15 \nsubsequently re-mating and\/or alter female perceptions of their health status resulting in 16 \nincreased resource reallocation to reproduction. Theoretical treatments support this 17 \n\u201cterminal investment\u201d hypothesis (Johnstone and Keller 2000; Lessells 2005), even when 18 \ndamage decreases the re-mating interval (Lessells 2005). However, empirical support for 19 \nthese models is lacking (Hosken et al. 2003; Morrow et al. 2003). 20 \n 21 \nThe bruchid beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus) is a species where harm inflicted by 22 \nmales is well documented.

Despite comparative evidence supporting 2 \nthe notion that the spines are involved in male-female antagonistic coevolution at the 3 \ninterspecific level (R\u00f6nn et al. 2007), evidence for an association between sexual 4 \nselection and genital damage is scarce at the intraspecific level. Hotzy and Arnqvist 5 \n(2009) demonstrated a correlation between spine length and male success in sperm 6 \ncompetition across populations, but no such relationship was found in two other studies 7 \ninvestigating why male bruchid beetles harm their mates (Edvardsson and Tregenza 8 \n2005; Morrow et al. 2003). Here we use an experimental evolution approach to further 9 \nassess the potential link between harm and sexual selection. 10 \n  11 \nExperimental evolution is a powerful tool that can be used to assess the evolution of 12 \nharm and female resistance to it. This approach has been used to eliminate sexual conflict 13 \n(and drastically reduce sexual selection) by enforcing monogamy. Males evolving under 14 \nmonogamy should evolve to become more benign to their partners since male and female 15 \nfitness are simultaneously maximized, while monogamous females should become more 16 \nsusceptible to harm because selection on counteradaptations to reduce harm is relaxed 17 \n(assuming that female resistance is costly). These predictions have been supported in 18 \nexperimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster (Holland and Rice 1999; Pitnick et 19 \nal. 2001a; Pitnick et al. 2001b). Similarly, enforced monogamy in the fly Sepsis cynipsea 20 \nenhanced female survival (Martin and Hosken 2003a) and monogamous populations of 21 \nScathophaga stercoraria had higher fitness than polyandrous lines (Martin et al. 2004). 22 \nIn an experiment where natural selection and sexual selection were manipulated 23 \nDeleted: , with only one study \nDeleted: ing\nDeleted:  (Hotzy and Arnqvist 2009)\nDeleted: will be \nDeleted: al when their single mate\u2019s \nfitness is maximal\nPage 50 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 5 \nsimultaneously, Fricke and Arnqvist (2007) showed that, when reared on standard diets, 1 \nmonogamous selection lines of Callosobruchus maculatus produced more offspring. 2 \nRecent studies have employed sex ratio biasing, to manipulate sexual conflict and sexual 3 \nselection. In D. pseudoobscura, male biased populations (with more scope for sexual 4 \nselection) did not differ greatly from monogamous lines (Crudgington et al. 2005), and 5 \nWigby and Chapman (2004) found no difference in the male harming ability of D. 6 \nmelanogaster lines with different sex ratios. 7 \n 8 \nFollowing the publication of the first experimental evolution studies aimed at 9 \nunderstanding the role of sexual selection by manipulating the mating regime, Snook 10 \n(2001) and then Wigby and Chapman (2004) argued that altering the sex ratio or 11 \npopulation density can result in differences in effective population size, so that different 12 \ntreatments experience different levels of drift and inbreeding. Additionally, because 13 \nmonogamous lines often have a smaller population size, differences in population sizes 14 \ncan be confounded with treatment. However, while th se criticisms are in principle 15 \nsound, they were refuted for the specific studies initially criticized (Rice et al. 2005; and 16 \nsee Reuter et al. 2008). More recently, Snook et al. (2009) raised additional concerns 17 \nabout inbreeding and genetic variation when population size is manipulated. The authors 18 \nstress that a lack of genetic drift and higher genetic variability could result in more 19 \nefficient selection in large populations. Beyond the effect of drift and genetic variability, 20 \ntheoretical models also suggest that sexually antagonistic coevolution is more likely in 21 \nlarge populations (Gavrilets 2000). Higher densities might favour more intense sexual 22 \nconflicts, due for example to interference from other males, through physical harm to 23 \nPage 51 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 6 \nfemales, seminal fluid toxicity or polyspermy (Arnqvist 1997; Arnqvist and Nilsson 1 \n2000; Gavrilets et al. 2001). Population size could therefore affect evolution via sexual 2 \nconflict in two ways: either because sexually antagonistic coevolution is more likely in 3 \nlarge populations, or because selection is more efficient in large populations (Robertson 4 \n1970). The later could result from the fact that large populations harbour greater levels of 5 \nstanding genetic variation and experience more mutations and little drift (Schultz and 6 \nLynch 1997; Willi et al. 2006). While there is evidence consistent with population size 7 \neffects on sexually antagonistic evolution (Gay et al. 2009; Hosken et al. 2009; Martin 8 \nand Hosken 2003b), there have been few attempts to document the relative effects of the 9 \npotential causal factors involved (but see \u00d6deen and Florin (2000) regarding selection 10 \nefficiency). Here we use a fully factorial experimental design where both population size 11 \nand standing genetic variability are manipulated to disentangle the effect of intensified 12 \nsexual conflicts from the effect of increased genetic diversity, in a context of reintroduced 13 \nconflicts.  14 \n 15 \nStarting with populations in which monogamy has been enforced for 90 generations, 16 \nwe reintroduced sexual conflict and sexual selection by allowing free mate choice and 17 \nmultiple mating. We established replicate populations differing in size and standing 18 \ngenetic variability. After 30 generations of reintroduced sexual conflict and sexual 19 \nselection, we preliminarily tested for effects of inbreeding in small and low variability 20 \npopulations. Then we examined whether genital damage evolved in response to the 21 \nreintroduction of sexual conflict (1), by comparing the extent of genital damage in 22 \nfemales mated to males from polygamous (conflict) lines compared to the monogamous 23 \nDeleted:  because these\nDeleted: were \nDeleted: We also tested for an effect of \ninbreeding in small and low variability \npopulations. \nDeleted:  \nPage 52 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 7 \n(relaxed conflict) lines from which they had been established 30 generations previously. 1 \nThen we examined whether sexual conflict resulted in more rapid evolution in larger 2 \npopulations or those with greater initial genetic variation (2), by comparing the evolution 3 \nof adaptations to polygamy across our lines. Additionally, we assessed the costs of 4 \ndamage (3) by evaluating associations between level of damage and female longevity and 5 \nlifetime reproductive success. Finally, we tested the two hypotheses about why males 6 \nharm females (4): Are damaging males better at accelerating female oviposition or 7 \ndeterring females to re-mate (adaptive harm hypothesis) or are they better at sperm 8 \ncompetition (collateral harm hypothesis)?

Each generation we isolated beans carrying eggs in 48-16 \nwell cell culture plates in order to collect virgin beetles immediately post-emergence. 17 \nVirgins (< 24h post eclosion) were subsequently paired and each pair was placed in a 18 \n40mm Petri dish and observed until copulation had ceased. From these monogamous 19 \npairs, 60 singly mated females were transferred together to approximately 400 beans for 20 \noviposition.  21 \nAfter 90 generations of enforced monogamy, polygamy was re-established in new 22 \npopulations established from the two lines by placing 60 newly emerged adults of each 23 \nDeleted:  we examined the evolution of \nharm by comparing the extent of genital \ndamage in females mated to males from \npolygamous (conflict) lines compared to \nthe monogamous (relaxed conflict) lines \nfrom which they had been established 30 \ngenerations previously.

A third polygamous line was created by combining 30 1 \nmales and 30 females from each of the monogamous lines. In this crossed population, 2 \ngenetic variability should be greater, because 90 generations of isolation and drift is 3 \nlikely to have promoted genetic differentiation and some loss of diversity from the two 4 \nmonogamous lines. These three polygamous lines were allowed to expand exponentially 5 \nfor two generations, before we established 16 experimental populations. The crossed 6 \npopulation (with enriched genetic diversity) seeded eight lines at two different densities 7 \n(four small populations size = 50 individuals, four large populations size = 5000 8 \nindividuals). Each of the two other polygamous lines was used separately to start another 9 \nfour polygamous lines with basal genetic variability, two small (50 individuals) and two 10 \nlarge (5000) (Fig. 1). This generated four treatments (small population size and basal 11 \ngenetic variability; small population size and enriched genetic variability; large 12 \npopulation size and basal genetic variability; large population size and enriched genetic 13 \nvariability) each with 4 replicates. Males and females were housed together for their 14 \nentire lifespan in all 16 lines. We continued to maintain the monogamous populations, as 15 \nabove. 16 \nTo retain a constant population size and ratio of resources to beetles, we sieved and 17 \nweighed the newly emerging adults each generation and placed another 50 (for the small 18 \npopulations), or 5000 (for the large ones) individuals on new black-eyed beans. Small 19 \npopulations were provided with 40g of beans in a cylindrical container 10cm wide and 20 \n4cm deep, large populations were provided with 4kg of beans in a rectangular container 21 \n30cm x 20cm x 13cm deep.

We accounted 4 \nfor this difference in the analysis of longevity (see below).  5 \nTo reduce possible maternal and phenotypic effects, we standardized selection one 6 \ngeneration prior to the assay (generation 30) for all populations by housing beetles 7 \nindividually under standardised conditions - single mating and one egg per bean (this is in 8 \nexcess of what a single larva can consume (Cope and Fox 2003)) - for one generation. 9 \nPrior to beetle emergence, we isolated these beans in \u2018virgin chambers\u2019 (48-Well cell 10 \nculture plates, VWR International Ltd, Lutterworth, UK). Beans were checked every 24h 11 \nfor emerging virgin adults (generation 31).  12 \n 13 \nTEST FOR INBREEDING DEPRESSION  14 \nIn our experiment, the small populations are potentially susceptible to inbreeding during 15 \nexperimental evolution. Inbreeding can lead to inbreeding depression affecting life 16 \nhistory traits (e.g. fecundity and longevity) (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1987; 17 \nDeRose and Roff 1999) and competitive male mating ability (Sharp 1984). These effects 18 \ncould potentially confound our predictions (see below). We looked for evidence of 19 \ninbreeding depression in fecundity, lifetime reproductive success and longevity by 20 \ncrossing males and females between replicate populations and comparing their 21 \nperformance to matings between males and females from within replicate populations 22 \n(the potentially inbred populations). We assessed those treatments most likely to suffer 23 \nPage 55 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 10 \ninbreeding depression, namely the populations of small census size and basal initial 1 \nstanding genetic variation. We also assessed the large populations with basal initial 2 \nstanding genetic variation as this allowed us to determine the potential impact of 3 \npopulation size and initial genetic variance on inbreeding depression. We analysed these 4 \ndata using a general linear model including population size, crossing status (within or 5 \nbetween replicate crosses) and their interaction. Elytra length (a measure of body size) 6 \nwas included as a covariate in the analysis of fecundity and lifetime reproductive success, 7 \nwhilst fecundity was included as a covariate in the analysis of longevity. 8 \n 9 \nMALE OFFENCE AND FEMALE RESISTANCE: DAMAGE, LONGEVITY AND 10 \nLIFETIME REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS  11 \nBoth males and females are likely to influence the amount of damage suffered by females 12 \nduring copulation. To isolate the damaging effect of males from the susceptibility of 13 \nfemales, we used the two monogamous lines as testers. Four types of crosses were 14 \nperformed: (1) between males from the polygamous populations and tester females (male 15 \noffence assay - \u2640M\u2642P); (2) between males and females from the same polygamous 16 \npopulation (female resistance assay - \u2640P\u2642P); (3) between females from the polygamous 17 \npopulations and tester males (\u2640P\u2642M); (4) a control cross between tester males and 18 \nfemales (\u2640M\u2642M). For each assay, 20 crosses were performed for each replicate (x4) of 19 \neach treatment (x4) (= 1280 crosses).  20 \n 21 \nVirgin females and males (all <24h post eclosion) were paired and each pair (10 pairs 22 \nx 4 treatments x 4 replicates x 4 crossings) was placed in a 40mm Petri dish and observed 23 \nPage 56 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 11 \nuntil copulation had ceased. Mated females were then placed on 10 beans for 24 hours 1 \nand then moved to another 60 beans for the remainder of their lives. We measured 2 \nfecundity in the first 24 hours of oviposition by directly counting eggs laid. Longevity 3 \nwas estimated by recording female mortality every 24 hours. After their natural death, 4 \nfemales were dissected and the number of damage points (scars) in their genital tracts 5 \ndetermined. For 25 females we also measured the area covered by scars and found that it 6 \nwas highly correlated with the number of scars (log-linear regression, R\u00b2 = 0.68). Female 7 \nelytra length was measured as a proxy for body size.  8 \n 9 \nMANIPULATION OF RE-MATING AND OVIPOSITION 10 \nWe measured the ability of males to deter females from subsequently re-mating (male 11 \ndefence) by mating monogamous tester females with males from the polygamous 12 \npopulations and then exposing them to monogamous tester males (\u2640M-\u2642P-\u2642M). We also 13 \nmeasured male offence - the ability of males to induce previously mated females to re-14 \nmate - by mating monogamous tester females with monogamous tester males and then 15 \nexposing them to males from the polygamous populations (\u2640M-\u2642M-\u2642P). For each assay, 16 \n10 females were paired and subsequently offered a chance to re-mate, following 24h of 17 \noviposition. Earlier studies revealed that over 80% of females will re-mate 24 h after their 18 \ninitial copulation (Eady et al. 2004; Edvardsson and Tregenza 2005) but in a pilot 19 \nexperiment we found lower re-mating rates in our lines that were maintained 20 \nmonogamous for 90 generations. We thus estimated that 24 h is a time point at which one 21 \nmight be able to distinguish differences in female re-mating propensity between 22 \nDeleted: (\nPage 57 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 12 \npopulations. Females were transferred to a 40mm Petri dish with a new virgin male (from 1 \nthe appropriate line) and were observed for 30 minutes to see if they copulated.  2 \n 3 \nWe measured the ability of males from the polygamous populations to stimulate 4 \nfemale fecundity by counting eggs laid during the female refractory period using males 5 \nfrom the 16 polygamous lines mated to 10 monogamous tester females. Again, mated 6 \nfemales were placed on 10 beans for 24 hours and then moved to another 60 beans for the 7 \nremainder of their lifespan. We subsequently counted the number of offspring produced 8 \nduring the first 24h after mating and over their entire lifespan, and then used the 9 \nproportion of offspring produced in 24h relative to the lifetime reproductive success as a 10 \nmeasure of male manipulation. Because both female re-mating rate and last male sperm 11 \nprecedence are high in this species (Eady et al. 2004; Edvardsson and Tregenza 2005), 12 \nthe benefits to any additional stimulation of oviposition beyond the first 24 hours will 13 \nprobably be enjoyed by rival males and as such we did not assess them here. 14 \n 15 \nSPERM COMPETITION 16 \nWe used a standard sperm competition experiment - where females are mated with two 17 \nmales - to test the hypothesis that harmful males are more successful at sperm 18 \ncompetition. Males from the polygamous populations were competed against black tester 19 \nmales from a separate polygamous line with both mating to a black tester female. The 20 \nblack phenotype is a naturally occurring polymorphism and this co-dominant marker was 21 \nused to score offspring. Offspring sired by brown males (with black females) are 22 \nPage 58 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 13 \nphenotypically intermediate (dark brown body colour and brown legs and antennae) and 1 \nreadily discernable from offspring from a black x black pair (Eady 1991).  2 \n 3 \nVirgin black females and black males were paired in individual 40mm Petri dishes 4 \nand observed until copulation began. After copulation ceased, males were removed and 5 \nfemales were allowed to oviposit for 20 hours on 5 beans. Females were then transferred 6 \nback to individual 40mm Petri dishes with a virgin brown male from one of the 7 \npolygamous populations. We repeated this for at least 20 females per replicate (4) per 8 \ntreatment (4). For each pair, we recorded whether copulation occurred successfully within 9 \n30 minutes. After copulation with the focal (brown) male ceased, each black female was 10 \ntransferred to a 90mm Petri dish containing 80 beans and allowed to oviposit until death. 11 \nEggs laid prior to the second mating were counted (first 20 h), as were the total number 12 \nof offspring after two successive matings, and offspring phenotype (hybrid or black) was 13 \nrecorded. P2 - the proportion of offspring sired by the second (focal = brown) male was 14 \ncalculated as the proportion of intermediate offspring. The experiment was repeated at 15 \ngeneration 32 to increase the sample size. We accounted for this by including a 16 \ngeneration factor in the analytical models. Additionally, to ascertain confidence in our co-17 \ndominant phenotypic marker, we estimated the repeatability of our paternity estimates by 18 \nre-measuring P2 blind to the first measurement for 20 randomly chosen females. P2 19 \nrepeatability was calculated following Lessells & Boag (1987), and was high (r = 0.996). 20 \n 21 \nSTATISTICAL ANALYSES  22 \nDeleted: females \nPage 59 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 14 \nAnalyses were performed in R. To avoid pseudoreplication, we performed all analyses on 1 \npopulation means. We also used mixed effect models adding replicate as a random effect 2 \nand obtained similar results, but only the results using the population means are presented 3 \nhere. All traits (damage, longevity, fecundity, lifetime reproductive success and elytra 4 \nlength) were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, all P > 0.05). Additionally, 5 \nresiduals did not deviate significantly from normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, all P > 6 \n0.05), and were not autocorrelated (Durbin-Watson test, all P> 0.05), and errors were 7 \nhomoscedastic (Breusch-Pagan test, all P > 0.05). 8 \n 9 \nCost of damage  10 \nWe used a general linear model to test the effect of population size, genetic variability 11 \nand their interaction on genital damage inflicted by polygamous line males. Female type 12 \n(monogamous or polygamous) was used as a third factor. We examined whether genital 13 \ndamage evolved with the reintroduction of sexual conflict and sexual selection by testing 14 \nfor an effect of male and female type (from a polygamous or monogamous line) on the 15 \namount of damage sustained by a female, using data from four assays (\u2640M\u2642P, \u2640P\u2642P, 16 \n\u2640P\u2642M and \u2640M\u2642M). We also examined the cost of damage by testing for a negative 17 \nrelationship between damage and longevity or damage and LRS using linear models. We 18 \nincluded population size, genetic variability and female type in the model, as well as 19 \nelytra length as a covariate for LRS and 24h fecundity as a covariate for longevity to 20 \naccount for life history trade offs. To account for the difference in longevity between the 21 \npopulations of the low variability treatment derived from the two monogamous lines, we 22 \nPage 60 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 15 \nadded a third level to the factor \u201cgenetic variability\u201d (i.e. we replaced basal\/enriched 1 \nvariability with basal from M1\/basal from M2\/enriched).  2 \n 3 \nEffect of damage on re-mating, oviposition and sperm competition  4 \nHarm could be beneficial for males if it deters females from re-mating, if it accelerates 5 \nthe oviposition rate or if it provides an advantage in sperm competition. We tested these 6 \nhypotheses using generalized linear models with the number of damage points (scars) in 7 \nfemales\u2019 genital tracts as an explanatory variable. For re-mating and sperm competition 8 \n(P2), a binomial error distribution was used. We corrected for overdispersion using a 9 \nquasi-binomial model when the ratio of residual deviance by residual degrees of freedom 10 \nwas larger than one. The number of eggs laid by the female in the first 24h (between both 11 \nmating occasions) was used as a covariate for re-mating and P2, elytra length was used as 12 \na covariate for all three variables.  13 \n 14 \nEffect of population size and genetic variability on male manipulative ability  15 \nTo ascertain how population size and genetic variability influence the evolution of males\u2019 16 \nability to affect female reproduction, we compared re-mating rates, oviposition rate and 17 \nP2 between our experimental populations that differ in the level of damage inflicted by 18 \nmales. For re-mating, we estimated an index of male manipulation by combining the 19 \nassays of male defence (\u2640M-\u2642P-\u2642M) and male offence (\u2640M-\u2642M-\u2642P): male manipulation 20 \nwas estimated as the difference between the proportion of females re-mating in the 21 \noffence experiment minus the proportion that re-mated in the defence experiment.

After 90 generations of 14 \nmonogamy, the reintroduction of sexual selection and sexual conflict for 30 generations 15 \nresulted in the evolution of more damaging males. However, there was no evidence that 16 \nfemale susceptibility to this damage (frequency of scaring) evolved during this time. In 17 \nspite of this, the response of females to damage did evolve, with females evolving under 18 \npolygamy typically having greater LRS and longevity at any given level of damage. 19 \nFurthermore, large population size rather than high initial genetic variation allowed males 20 \nto evolve faster and become more harmful. In addition, we provide evidence that genital 21 \ndamage is costly for females. It unequivocally reduced female longevity and tended to 22 \nreduce lifetime reproductive success, although this latter effect was complicated by an 23 \nDeleted: effect \nDeleted: had on female fitness \nPage 66 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 21 \ninteraction with population size (see discussion below). Overall, these results suggest that 1 \nsexual conflicts favours males that inflict costly genital damage to females and that the 2 \nevolution of harm was more pronounced in large populations, either because selection 3 \nwas more efficient or because large population size intensified sexual conflicts and 4 \nfavoured sexually antagonistic coevolution. This implies that sexual selection creates 5 \nconditions where males benefit from harming females in C. maculatus.  6 \n 7 \nMean damage levels were not associated with female oviposition rate or propensity to 8 \nre-mate. Our results thus provide no support for the adaptive harm hypothesis. This is in 9 \nagreement with previous work: Edvardsson and Tregenza (2005) manipulated copulation 10 \nduration to elevate female damage (Crudgington 2001) and also found no benefits to 11 \nharming males via delayed re-mating or increased rate of offspring production. 12 \nConsequently, and despite theoretical support, there is still no empirical evidence for the 13 \nadaptive harm hypothesis, whether the mechanism involved is terminal investment or 14 \ndelayed re-mating (Edvardsson and Tregenza 2005; Hosken et al. 2003; Morrow et al. 15 \n2003), and our results serve to reinforce this. Males from populations with basal genetic 16 \nvariability were better at stimulating female oviposition in the first 24 hours. This could 17 \nbe because favourable gene combinations were broken up by mixing of the two 18 \nmonogamous lines to create the populations with enriched genetic variability, although 19 \nmore work is needed to determine whether epistatic interactions can explain this finding.    20 \n 21 \nIf harm does not benefit males directly, it could be a side-effect of some other male 22 \nadaptation to male-male competition (the collateral harm hypothesis), with the obvious 23 \nDeleted: manipulating \nDeleted:  speed\nDeleted: pleiotropic \nPage 67 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 22 \ncandidate being sperm competitive ability. However, we found no evidence supporting 1 \nthe idea that males from more damaging populations are more successful in sperm 2 \ncompetition. P2 is a composite trait that is likely to be influenced by an unknown number 3 \nof male derived chemicals and behaviours, so that the prediction of the effect of 4 \npopulation size might be less straightforward than for simpler traits such as genital 5 \ndamage. Nevertheless, in the dung fly S. cynipsea more damaging males were not more 6 \ncompetitive (Teuschl et al. 2007) and our findings are in agreement with results from 7 \nEdvardsson and Tregenza (2005) who failed to find an effect of damage on P2. In 8 \ncontrast, Hotzy and Arnqvist (2009) found that across 13 geographically distinct 9 \npopulations of C. maculatus, male genital armature and the harm males inflict upon 10 \nfemales were positively correlated with male success in sperm competition. This 11 \ndiscrepancy between C. maculatus studies could result from the fact that the balance 12 \nbetween the advantage in sperm competition and the cost of harming females is 13 \n\u201ccontingent upon mating system, female life histories and sperm competition regime\u201d 14 \n(Hotzy and Arnqvist 2009), which may differ when looking within rather than across 15 \npopulations, and certainly could differ across studies. Our results, in conjunction with 16 \nEdvardsson\u2019s (2005), suggest that the damage inflicted by the spines is not associated 17 \nwith male success in sperm competition, but the damage they inflict did evolve after only 18 \n30 generations of restored polygamy. Perhaps a direct measure of spininess would be 19 \nmore revealing (e.g. Hotzy & Arnqvist, 2009), but perhaps the spines serve other 20 \npurposes too, such as anchoring males firmly during copulation (Edvardsson and 21 \nTregenza 2005). Using spines as an anchor could be beneficial for males if female 22 \nDeleted: harm done \nDeleted: aedeagal \nPage 68 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 23 \nkicking behaviour was a way to exert mate choice or to avoid being dislodged by 1 \ncompeting males before ejaculate transfer (Simmons 2001).  2 \n 3 \nLike the damage inflicted by males which evolved after 30 generations in our 4 \npolygamous lines, females have also evolved resistance to harm. It is interesting that the 5 \nnumber of scars inflicted by males did not differ in females evolving under polygamy or 6 \nmonogamy, but the effects did. Damage inflicted by males could increase female 7 \ninvestment in immunocapacity, as has been suggested in other insects (Reinhardt and 8 \nSiva-Jothy 2007). As a result, the LRS and longevity of females evolving under 9 \npolygamy were on average higher. Our longevity results are straightforward: increased 10 \ndamage leads to reduced longevity and females from polygamous populations always live 11 \nlonger than monogamous females at any given level of damage. Similarly, LRS of 12 \nfemales from monogamous populations always tended to be lower across damage levels. 13 \nNevertheless, LRS results are somewhat more complicated in that the damage effect only 14 \nshows up in an interaction with the population size of the male. When males are from 15 \nlarger populations, more damage equates to lower LRS, but when males are from smaller 16 \npopulations more damage does not reduce LRS. This could reflect a lower cost per scar 17 \nof male damage in small populations, coupled with lower numbers of scars. Only males 18 \nfrom large populations seem to have evolved beyond a threshold where damage becomes 19 \ncostly (in terms of LRS). It is unlikely that the lack of cost in small populations is due to 20 \nhigher female resistance because neither monogamous nor polygamous females suffered 21 \nreduced LRS when mated to males from small populations.

If coevolution is more 3 \nlikely to happen in large populations, we expect more harmful males (as observed: large 4 \nmales inflict more scars), but also more resistant females (higher LRS in large 5 \npopulations), which in return escalates towards more costly damage. These findings are 6 \ngenerally consistent with a previous comparative analysis within the seed beetles 7 \n(Coleoptera: Bruchidae) which also provided evidence for male-female coevolution. In 8 \nspecies where males had evolved more harmful genitalia, females had evolved a more 9 \nrobust copulatory tract (R\u00f6nn et al. 2007). This observation is congruent with sexually 10 \nantagonistic coevolution, which we also found within our group of experimental 11 \npopulations, and experimental evolution of similar durations has documented evolution in 12 \nfemale resistance\/susceptibility in other taxa (Martin and Hosken 2003a).  13 \n 14 \nDespite manipulating population size for 30 generations, we found no evidence for 15 \ninbreeding depression in smaller populations. This could result from purging of 16 \ndeleterious mutations over the 90 generations of monogamy when population size was 17 \nrelatively small (between 100 and 150 individuals for each of the two monogamous 18 \nlines), assuming that inbreeding depression is primarily due to the expression of 19 \ndeleterious recessives and not to loss of heterozygosity in C. maculatus. Alternatively, 20 \npopulation sizes of this order may escape serious inbreeding over this time frame. Recent 21 \nresults suggest that the spectrum of deleterious mutations contains a high proportion of 22 \nvery small effect mutation (<<1%) (Estes et al. 2004) such that even large finite 23 \nPage 70 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 25 \npopulations will gradually accumulate deleterious recessive alleles, but such small effects 1 \nmay not be detectable over the 30 generations of our study. Since it appears that the lower 2 \nLRS of our small populations was not due to inbreeding depression, it must have arisen 3 \nfrom another property of small population sizes. The potential alternatives are the 4 \nindependent fixation of mutations that are not associated with inbreeding depression, 5 \nsuch as dominant mutations. These may accumulate due to stronger drift, a lower number 6 \nof new mutations resulting in lower genetic variability to fuel evolutionary change, or 7 \nless intense conflicts between males and females reducing the strength of sexual 8 \nselection. The effects of genetic drift are taken into account by using replicates for each 9 \ntreatment: a major role of drift seems unlikely given that the responses in all replicate 10 \npopulations were in the same direction. Alternatively, the evolution of small populations 11 \ncould have been constrained by the lack of genetic variability. We designed our 12 \nexperimental to disentangle the effect of population size from that of genetic variability: 13 \nif the higher genetic variability in large populations was crucial for the observed 14 \nmicroevolution, we would expect to see a significant ffect of initial genetic variability as 15 \nwell as an effect of population size, which we did not. This argues against the hypothesis 16 \nthat the large populations evolved faster because of their higher standing genetic 17 \nvariability. It is worth noting that our design relies on the assumption that genetic 18 \nvariability is indeed higher in the crossed populations (with enriched genetic variability) 19 \nthan in the two monogamous lines. However, it does seem likely that genetic variation 20 \nwill be structured predominantly between, rather than within lines after 90 generations of 21 \nisolation at a relatively small population size. The lack of inbreeding effects observed 22 \ncould slightly weaken this assumption, unless it results from an efficient purge of 23 \nPage 71 of 85 Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 26 \ndeleterious mutations, as suggested above. Three broad explanations therefore remain for 1 \nthe patterns we detect: (1) larger populations experience a larger number of new 2 \nmutations; (2) selection is more efficient in large populations; (3) sexual selection 3 \n(including that driven by sexual conflict) is more intense in larger populations and 4 \nsexually antagonistic coevolution is favoured, as discussed in the Introduction. Although 5 \nour population sizes are sufficiently large for us to expect new mutations, some of which 6 \nmay affect conflict adaptations, 30 generations is a short time for such new mutations to 7 \nbecome fixed. Hence the most likely explanation for the patterns we observe seems to be 8 \nthe potential for larger populations to evolve faster through an increased intensity of 9 \nsexual conflicts combined with more efficient selection with larger effective size 10 \n(Robertson 1970). This is in accordance with theoretical models predicting that sexually 11 \nantagonistic coevolution is more likely in large populations (Gavrilets 2000; Gavrilets et 12 \nal. 2001). 13 \n 14 \nOur experimental design manipulated population size and standing genetic variability 15 \nsimultaneously and independently. It thus contributes empirical data relevant to debates 16 \non the effect of population size and inbreeding in experimental evolution, in particular 17 \nexperimental sexual selection. Effective population size is a key parameter in these 18 \nexperimental evolution studies, firstly because the experimental manipulation of mating 19 \nsystems or sex ratio can lead to different effective population sizes between treatments 20 \nand confound effects (Snook et al. 2009). Secondly, small populations may lack the 21 \ninflux of new beneficial mutations, but slightly deleterious mutations are more likely to 22 \nget fixed. Finally, small populations suffer less intense conflicts.

For example, our experiment suggests that some 2 \nevolutionary trajectories might only occur if effective population size is sufficiently large. 3 \nSimilarly, Reuter et al. (2008) showed that predicted patterns of sexual selection can be 4 \nconstrained by low effective population size. \u00d6deen and Florin (2000) further suggested 5 \nthat low effective population size could constrain the evolution of assortative mating and 6 \nthereby limit the power of experimental tests of sympatric or parapatric speciation. 7 \nMoreover, sexual selection itself changes effective population size and as the intensity of 8 \nselection increases and male mating success becomes more skewed, populations 9 \nexperiencing sexual selection will have smaller effective population sizes. Classically, 10 \neffective population size is estimated as (4nmnf)\/(nm + nf), where nm is male number and 11 \nnf is female number (Hartl 2000). If the number of males contributing genes to offspring 12 \nis low, then the effective population size is also reduced (assuming that nf is constant). As 13 \na result, we suggest that attempting to manipulate population size in order to remove this 14 \nfeature of sexual selection (Snook et al. 2009) is only justified where there is an explicit 15 \naim to focus on other effects of selection. Where this is not the case we suggest that 16 \nmaintaining large census sizes when possible is the best approach, if only because 17 \nselection is always more efficient in large populations (Willi et al. 2006). In particular, it 18 \ncan be misleading to focus on maintaining equal effective population sizes if the 19 \nincreased work load and\/or limited space constrain replicates to small census size.  20 \n 21 \nIn conclusion, this study is the first attempt at reversing experimental evolution under 22 \nsexual conflicts.

Damage was costly for females, in 2 \nterms of longevity and lifetime reproductive success, but the benefits to males are 3 \nunclear. It seems unlikely that the aedeagal spines which damage females evolved solely 4 \nto harm, and further research is needed to assess whether damage is associated with 5 \nbenefits during non-sperm competition forms of male-male competition in these 6 \npopulations. Finally, population size affected the evolutionary responses we detected, but 7 \nnot via an inbreeding effect, suggesting sexual selection was more effective in our larger 8 \npopulations.   9 \nPage 74 of 85Evolution\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Review Only\n 29 \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nWe would like to thank A.

Diagram of the experimental design. 90 generations of relaxed sexual selection \nand sexual conflicts (monogamy, in grey) was followed by 30 generations of restored \npolygamy (in black). In parallel, the two monogamous lines were maintained to be used \nas testers. At generation 90, the two monogamous lines were crossed. Generations 91 and \n92 were population expansion. At generation 92, the four treatments were set up by \nmanipulating population size (large or small) and using the enhanced genetic variability \nof the crossed line to form four treatments: large population size enriched genetic \nvariability, large population size basal genetic variability, small population size enriched \ngenetic variability and small population size basal genetic variability, with four replicates \nfor each treatment (16 lines in total). All lines were standardized for mating rate and \nlarval density at generation 122 and 123.  \n \nFigure 2.
