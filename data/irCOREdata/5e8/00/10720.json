The paper discusses the micro level of individuals, but also their group processes \u2013 how project team members \u201egrow into\u201f the project team culture in an interorganisational project. We also consider the role of emotions in such project work. The paper concludes by discussing how some of organisational learning and knowledge work issues could be attributed to inter-organisational issues and considers some theoretical and practical implications.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Paper presented at the International Conference on Organizational Learning, Knowledge and Capabilities (OKLC) in Amsterdam, 26-28 April 2009.
