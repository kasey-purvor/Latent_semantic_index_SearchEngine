P. Harris, C. Huntingford, P. M. Cox\n1. Introduction\nFirst generation coupled climate-carbon cycle models indicate that carbon-cycle\nfeedbacks may accelerate anthropogenic climate change through the 21st century\n(Friedlingstein et al., 2006). The principal feedbacks are from the terrestrial bio-\nsphere, and one model in particular (HadCM3LC, Cox et al., 2000) simulates an\nalmost complete loss of forest from the Amazon basin between 2050 and 2100 under\nconditions of locally reduced precipitation and increased air temperature. While fu-\nture drying of the Amazon basin is not common to all general circulation models\n(GCMs) contributing to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth\nAssessment Report (IPCC AR4; Christensen et al., 2007), it remains useful to study\nthe processes that contribute to the strong Amazon climate change exhibited by\nCox et al..\nBetts et al. (2004) estimate that global carbon-cycle feedbacks and vegetation\nstructural changes in HadCM3LC contribute to approximately 40% of the simu-\nlated Amazon basin precipitation reduction. This indicates that the majority of\nthe regional drying is part of a wider atmosphere-ocean response to greenhouse\nwarming. The HadCM3LC trend in 21st century Pacific SST has been described\nas \u201cEl Nin\u02dco-like\u201d (Collins, 2005), and Cox et al. (2004) show that a future weak-\nening of Amazon basin rainfall during December to February is correlated with a\nprogressive weakening of the equatorial Pacific east-west sea surface temperature\n(SST) gradient. They suggest that Amazon basin drying is related to this SST\nchange through Walker circulation perturbations, similar to those thought to re-\nlate observed South American rainfall and El Nin\u02dco-Southern Oscillation (ENSO;\nAceituno, 1998; Grimm, 2003).\nHowever, the observed seasonal cycle and interannual variation in Amazon\nbasin precipitation are linked additionally to tropical Atlantic SST (e.g., Nobre\nand Shukla, 1996; Marengo et al., 2001). Most recently, it was suggested that pro-\nlonged dry periods in parts of the Amazon basin through 2005 were related to an\nanomalously warm tropical north Atlantic (Marengo, 2006). The potential contri-\nbution of Pacific and Atlantic SST change to Amazon drying in HadCM3LC is\nnoted by Li et al. (2006) in an analysis of AR4 model output. However, such an\nanalysis of transient GCM simulations is unable to distinguish the relative roles of\nconcurrent SST changes in each ocean basin.\nTo investigate the roles of future Pacific and Atlantic SST change in Amazon\nbasin drying we run the atmospheric component of HadCM3LC with a range of SST\nboundary conditions derived from the transient simulations of Cox et al. (2000).\nThe model and methods used are described in Section 2, and the HadAM3 control\nclimate is described in Section 3. The results of the HadAM3 simulations with\nAmazon basin climate under global warming 3\ndifferent SST boundary conditions are described in Section 4, and conclusions are\ngiven in Section 5.\n2. Model and methods\nThe atmospheric GCM used in this study is HadAM3 (Pope et al., 2000) including\nthe MOSES2 land surface scheme (Essery et al., 2001). HadAM3 is hydrostatic,\nprimitive equation model with discretisation of 19 vertical levels and 96\u00d7 73 hori-\nzontal gridboxes, corresponding to a gridbox size of 3.75\u25e6 longitude \u00d7 2.5\u25e6 latitude.\nIn a control simulation (CONT), HadAM3 is integrated for ten model years\nusing the GISST 1961\u201390 climatology (Parker et al., 1995, version 2.3b) as the\nSST boundary condition. Unless stated otherwise, atmospheric CO2 concentration\nin each of these simulations was set to the HadCM3LC 1961\u201390 mean value of 348\nppmv. The initial three years of the simulation are excluded from the analysis to\nallow the model to \u2018spin-up\u2019. A further six experimental integrations are made by\nadding to the GISST climatology SST anomalies (SSTAs) based on climatologies\nof HadCM3LC-simulated SST change between 1961\u201390 and 2040\u201359. This future\nperiod, centred on 2050, is chosen to simulate an Amazon basin climate change\nsufficient to initiate forest loss in HadCM3LC, but also one through which the\neffects of vegetation change on Amazon rainfall are weak (see Betts et al., 2004).\nThe annual mean HadCM3LC SST change, shown in Figure 1, exhibits warming\nin almost all ocean gridboxes corresponding to a global annual mean warming of\n1.7\u25e6C. Notable regional features in the tropics are an east-west gradient in Pacific\nwarming, a north-south gradient in Atlantic warming, and a near-uniform warm-\ning of the Indian Ocean. The maximum eastward extent of the equatorial Pacific\nwarming occurs through the Northern Hemisphere winter (December\u2013February),\nthe same season as the peak SSTAs in this region observed during El Nin\u02dco events.\nTropical Atlantic SST changes enhance the existing SST seasonal cycle and produce\na northward shift in the location of the maximum SST throughout the year.\nThe study assesses the contribution of these SST features to modelled Amazon\nclimate change using the SST boundary conditions summarised in Table 1. A full\nHadCM3LC SST change simulation (MWLA) is an atmosphere-only reproduction\nof the HadCM3LC response to mean 2040\u201359 SST change. An additional simulation\nis made using MWLA SSTAs but with atmospheric CO2 concentration increased\nto the HadCM3LC 2040\u201359 mean value of 592 ppmv to verify that HadAM3 re-\nproduces the full HadCM3LC Amazon basin climate change. The full MWLA SST\nchange is separated further into two components: a global mean warming (MW)\nand gridbox local anomalies to this global mean (LA). In a further three simula-\ntions the local anomalies are restricted to the tropical basins of the Atlantic (ATL),\n4 P. P. Harris, C. Huntingford, P. M. Cox\nPacific (PAC) and Indian (IND) oceans between 25\u25e6S and 25\u25e6N, and bounded by\n15\u25e6 latitude and longitude linear relaxations to zero anomaly to prevent unrealistic\nspatial discontinuities in SST.\n3. Simulated control climate\nA detailed global analysis of the HadAM3 control climate (as reproduced by the\nCONT simulation herein) is given by Pope et al. (2000), and only the model biases\nover South America and the tropical Atlantic are described in this section. Amazon\nbasin area means quoted in this section and following ones are calculated over the\nmodel gridboxes indicated in Figure 1. The observation datasets used herein are\nthe CMAP observation-only climatology for precipitation (Xie and Arkin, 1997),\nand the CRU land-only climatology for 1.5 m air temperature (Ta from version\nCRU-CL-1.0; New et al., 1999).\nThe CONT simulation produces tropical precipitation with annual mean wet\nbias of 1.0 mm day\u22121 over tropical land. Over South America, the annual mean pre-\ncipitation rate north of 40\u25e6S is 4.2 mm day\u22121 corresponding to a 0.1 mm day\u22121 wet\nbias. This is compared to a dry bias of 0.4 mm day\u22121 for this region in HadCM3LC.\nOver the Amazon basin, defined here by the shaded gridboxes in Figure 1, the\nCONT annual mean precipitation rate of 5.3 mm day\u22121 has a dry bias of 0.1 mm\nday\u22121, which is weaker than the dry bias of 0.8 mm day\u22121 in HadCM3LC. Simu-\nlated peak mature SAM precipitation rates of 9 to 10 mm day\u22121 from December\nthrough February (DJF) agree with CMAP rates in magnitude, but are located\napproximately 5\u25e6 too far south. This produces a \u201cdipole\u201d of dry-wet biases from\nthe Amazon to 20\u25e6S for both CONT and HadCM3LC. When estimated biases in\nCMAP annual mean rainfall of 10\u201320% over Amazon basin are considered (Xie\nand Arkin, 1997), both CONT and HadCM3LC are acceptable simulations of SAM\nprecipitation in timing and magnitude.\nAnnual mean Ta over the Amazon basin is 25.3\n\u25e6C in CONT, corresponding to\na cool bias of 0.4\u25e6C compared with the CRU dataset, and which contrasts with\na HadCM3LC warm bias of 0.8\u25e6C. This cool bias over the whole basin comprises\nstrong cold biases of 2\u25e6C in the Andes and weaker warm biases of less than 1\u25e6C in\nthe Amazon lowlands. New et al. (1999) note that the interpolation method used\nto construct the CRU dataset tends to underestimate the air temperature lapse-\nrate, resulting in air temperatures that are probably too warm at high altitudes.\nAccounting for this bias would tend to reduce the cool bias in the Amazon basin\nmean. In the Amazon lowlands, monthly mean Ta values are within 1\n\u25e6C of CRU\ndata throughout the year.\nAmazon basin climate under global warming 5\n4. Results\n(a) Rainfall response to global SST changes\nAn annual Amazon basin rainfall reduction (Table 2) of 1.4 mm day\u22121 (\u221230%)\nin HadCM3LC is reproduced by HadAM3 as a MWLA drying of 1.1 mm day\u22121\n(\u221221%). The spatial extent of this drying is coincident in the two models, and covers\nthe whole Amazon basin. The additional simulation (not shown) with atmospheric\nCO2 increased to 592 ppmv produces a drying of 1.4 mm day\n\u22121 (\u221227%), indicating\nthat much of the additional drying in HadCM3LC is due to effects of elevated CO2\nin the coupled model. This is consistent with the results of Betts et al. (2004)\nwho estimate that the stomatal response to increased CO2 enhances the drying by\napproximately 20%.\nMonthly mean rainfall anomalies for MWLA in Figure 2a show that the greatest\ndrying of up to 2.8 mm day\u22121 occurs between May and November, outside of\nthe peak months of the SAM, and through which observed interannual variance\nin Amazon basin rainfall is greatest. This dry season response has been noted\npreviously for HadCM3LC by Li et al. (2006). Weak rainfall increases through the\nmature SAM months of January to March reflect enhanced SAM rainfall with no\nshift in location of the peak from the southern edge of the Amazon basin (as defined\nin Figure 1). In contrast, HadCM3LC exhibits a 1.1 mm day\u22121 drying through\nthese months (not shown), probably related to a stomatal response to increased\nCO2. Rainfall reductions through May and June correspond to an early recession\nof the SAM.\nComparison with the MW and LA simulations shows that these May to Novem-\nber rainfall reductions are part of an atmosphere response to regional patterns of\nSST warming, rather than the increase in global mean SST. Moreover, this corre-\nsponds to a delayed onset of the Amazon basin monsoon and a longer dry season.\nThe effect of global mean SST increase in MW is to enhance the existing seasonal\ncycle of rainfall over the Amazon basin. However, these monthly changes are not\nstatistically significant and the effect on the annual mean Amazon basin rainfall is\nrelatively small.\n(b) Response to tropical SST changes\nAnnual mean rainfall rates in Table 2 show Amazon basin drying in ATL and\nPAC of 0.3 mm day\u22121 and 0.6 mm day\u22121 respectively. Neither Pacific nor Atlantic\nSST gradient changes alone explain the strength of rainfall reduction in response\nto global SST gradient changes. Moreover, the sum of ATL and PAC anomalies\nexplains only 80% of drying in LA, indicating that the response to global SST\n6 P. P. Harris, C. Huntingford, P. M. Cox\nanomalies is not simply the response to Atlantic and Pacific SSTAs summed through\nall seasons. These annual mean rainfall responses suggest a stronger response to\nPacific SST gradients changes than Atlantic gradient changes, however, it is shown\nin the following sections that there are significant differences between seasons.\nAn IND annual mean drying of 0.2 mm day\u22121 corresponds to a weakening\nof December to February rainfall over north east Brazil rather than the Amazon\nbasin. This is consistent with a modelled rainfall response to warm Indian ocean\nSSTAs following El Nin\u02dco events (Spencer et al., 2004). However, because there is\nno statistically significant response over the Amazon basin, the IND simulation is\nnot considered further here.\n(i) Amazon basin dry season\nMonthly mean Amazon basin rainfall anomalies for ATL in Fig. 2a show a\nconsistent drying of approximately 1 mm day\u22121 from June to November, and a\nsimilar 1 mm day\u22121 drying in PAC from August to November. Both correspond to\na longer dry season, which is a strong determinant of vegetation type in the tropics\n(Sternberg, 2001), but the ATL dry season is more severe annual minimum than\nthat in PAC.\nAssociated with these dry season rainfall decreases in the ATL and PAC simu-\nlations are changes in the Hadley and Walker circulations respectively (Fig. 3). In\nresponse to Atlantic SSTAs over the tropical South America\/Atlantic region there is\nan overall strengthening of the Hadley circulation and associated rainfall increases\nover ocean. The effect of this over South America is indicated in Fig. 3b by increased\nascent from 10\u25e6 to 30\u25e6N over warm SSTAs and increased descent between 30\u25e6S and\n5\u25e6N across the same latitudes as cool SSTAs. There are also stronger 950 hPa cross-\nequatorial southerlies and a shift in Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) rainfall\nfrom South America north of the equator towards the Caribbean. These changes\ncould affect Amazon rainfall through both increased upper-troposphere convergence\nand reduced lower-troposphere moisture convergence (Hastenrath, 2000).\nObserved Atlantic ITCZ rainfall, unlike the mean change in ATL, exhibits little\ninterannual variation in latitude through the dry season (Chiang et al., 2002). From\nJuly through September a strong meridional gradient in tropical SST supports\nITCZ convection over only a narrow band of latitudes. As a result, the peak SST\nand the associated ITCZ rainfall are moved only by relatively large SSTAs. For the\nfuture change, ATL SSTAs (Fig. 3b, lower panel) are sufficient to shift northwards\nthe maximum SST from 7.5\u25e6to 12\u25e6N and strengthen the inter-hemispheric SST\ngradient, resulting in the significant drying over northern South America. The ATL\ninter-hemispheric gradient also persists for one to two months longer at the end of\nAmazon basin climate under global warming 7\nthe dry season, which leads to a delay in the SAM development phase (Li and Fu,\n2004).\nThe atmospheric response to Pacific SSTAs through the dry season (Fig. 3d)\nexhibits increased ascent over the warm equatorial east Pacific SSTAs from 135\u25e6 to\n85\u25e6W and descent over cool west Pacific SSTAs. These anomalies correspond to a\nweaker, but extant, Pacific Walker circulation. However, the strongest east Pacific\nascent increase from July through September occurs over the warmest SSTs around\n10\u25e6N, away from the equatorial SST \u201ccold tongue\u201d. This results in a removal of\nthe 600 to 200 hPa mean ascent over equatorial South America and the associ-\nated rainfall reduction in Fig. 2a. Because the east Pacific convection anomaly is\nlocated north of the Equator, the Andes form less of a barrier to lower-troposphere\nconnections with the equatorial and northern Amazon than for warm SSTA in the\nequatorial east Pacific (Fu et al., 2001). It is likely that this helps limit significant\nPAC Amazon basin rainfall reductions to the dry season.\n(ii) South American monsoon season\nThrough the mature SAM season (JFM) there are few significant changes in\nAmazon basin rainfall (Fig. 2a) from any SSTAs, with the exception of ATL for\nMarch. This March rainfall increase due to Atlantic SSTAs comprises a 1 mm day\u22121\nincrease in SAM maximum rainfall on southern edge of basin (not shown), with an\nassociated strengthening of the existing Hadley circulation (Fig. 3a). Chiang et al.\n(2002) note that a broad Atlantic SST maximum about the equator during these\nmonths supports ITCZ convection over a range of latitudes, resulting in the great-\nest observed interannual variation in ITCZ location from January through April.\nWarm equatorial SSTAs (Fig. 3a, lower panel) enhance the climatological equato-\nrial maximum SST and increase the SST gradient away from the equator favouring\nan enhanced monsoon. However, the relatively short simulation lengths make it dif-\nficult to distinguish a significant mean wet season change from internal variability\nthrough these months, despite relatively strong ATL circulation anomalies.\n(c) Amazon basin surface response to SST change\nThe previous Sections describe how mid-21st century SST change in HadCM3LC\nis associated with a 21% reduction in annual mean Amazon basin rainfall. However,\nrainfall change initiates modelled forest loss only indirectly through the effect of soil\nmoisture limitation on vegetation net primary productivity (NPP). Table 2 shows\nthat the MWLA rainfall reduction coincides with a 10% reduction in soil moisture\nbut a proportionately greater 52% reduction in basin mean NPP. Comparison with\n8 P. P. Harris, C. Huntingford, P. M. Cox\nsimulations MW and LA indicates that this NPP change comprises approximately a\n30% reduction from SST gradients and a 23% reduction from global mean warming.\nAmazon basin monthly mean air temperature (Fig. 2b) exhibits a MW warming\nof 3 to 5\u25e6C through the year with no significant soil moisture reduction (Fig. 2c).\nWhile MWLA soil moisture reductions are attributable to SST gradient changes in\nall months, the corresponding NPP reductions in LA are 2.5 to 3.0 Mg C ha\u22121 yr\u22121\nweaker than those in MWLA. This difference may be accounted for by the NPP\nresponse to mean SST warming. This indicates that there would be a significantly\nreduced Amazon basin NPP in HadCM3LC, even in the absence of SST gradient\nchanges in the Atlantic and Pacific. However, the NPP reduction required to initiate\nforest loss would occur later in the 21st-century. It is interesting to note that a\nsimulation with increased atmospheric CO2 (not shown) exhibited a weaker NPP\nreduction of 33% due to the effect of CO2 fertilisation.\nThe rainfall responses to tropical Atlantic and Pacific SSTAs produce relatively\nweak annual mean NPP reductions (Table 2) of 9% and 13% respectively. Each\nof these reductions is unlikely to be sufficient to cause forest loss. These NPP re-\nductions are primarily in response to reduced dry season soil moisture (Fig. 2c),\nalthough there is some PAC wet season drying restricted to land around the Ama-\nzon river mouth. The drier ATL soil through the dry season is offset by the wet\nseason rainfall increase to produce a relatively weak (3%) annual mean reduction.\nThese contrast markedly with the strong, perennial LA soil moisture reduction pro-\nduced when the combined ATL and PAC dry season responses are propagated from\nyear to year. This indicates that the contribution of SST-related rainfall change to\nHadCM3LC Amazon basin forest loss requires both the Atlantic and Pacific SST\ngradient changes examined herein.\n5. Conclusions\nA scenario as striking as the predicted loss of Amazon forest by Cox et al. (2000),\nalong with the associated social and economic implications for the region, war-\nrants further investigation. This is particularly important because regional climate\nprojections for tropical South America are not consistent across different GCMs\ncontributing to the IPCC AR4.\nThis study used atmospheric GCM simulations to assess the effect of simulated\nfuture SST change on Amazon basin climate. Particular attention was given to the\nroles of SST gradient change in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific. We conclude that\nseveral concurrent SST conditions are sufficient to reduce Amazon basin NPP to a\nlevel at which rainforest is unsustainable. These conditions include strengthening\nof inter-hemispheric SST gradients in the Atlantic and east Pacific through the\nAmazon basin climate under global warming 9\nAmazon basin dry season, and global mean SST warming. The establishment of\nthese Atlantic and Pacific SSTAs under greenhouse warming is uncertain; current\ncoupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs disagree on the signs of SST gradient change\nacross both the zonal equatorial Pacific (Collins, 2005) and meridional Atlantic\n(Good et al., 2007). This study highlights the importance of reducing uncertainty\nin the prediction of future SST change, in order to understand and quantify the\nrisk of climate change-induced loss of Amazon rainforest.\n6.
