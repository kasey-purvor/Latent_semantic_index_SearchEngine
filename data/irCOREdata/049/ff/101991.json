Aeo-\nlian ripples are a few centimeters in wavelength and their\ncrests lie perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction.\nBagnold (1941) made an influential early study [2]. He\nidentified the importance of saltation, where sand grains\nare entrained by the wind, and whipped along the sand bed,\ncolliding with it at high speed (of order #1 m\u0001s [3]), and\ncausing other grains to jump out of and along the bed, thus\nsculpting ripples. The impact angle remains roughly con-\nstant at about 10\u00b1\u201316\u00b1despite the gusting of the wind. The\nstoss slope of the ripple lies in the range 8\u00b1\u201310\u00b1 [4].\nThe lee slope is composed of a short straight section near\nthe crest at an angle of about 30\u00b1\u201334\u00b1 to the horizon-\ntal [2,4,5], followed by a longer and shallower concave\nsection. The deposition of grains on the lee slope of\nsand dunes leads to oversteepening and avalanching [6,7],\nwhich maintains the lee slope at an angle of around 30\u00b1\u2013\n34\u00b1 near the crest. A similar, if less dramatic, mechanism\nis likely to hold for ripples.\nNumerical simulations of ripples and dunes based on\ntracking individual sand grains or on cellular automata\nhave in the past few years yielded good qualitative agree-\nment with observations [8]. However, these methods are\ncomputationally expensive. Continuum models provide\na complementary approach allowing faster calculation of\nripple evolution, and the possibility of obtaining certain\ninformation, such as the preferred ripple wavelength, ana-\nlytically. Anderson [9] produced an analytical model\nof the initial generation of ripples from a flat bed. A\none-species analytical continuum model was formulated\nby Hoyle and Woods [10]. In the current Letter we\nextend the one-species model [10] to include relaxation\neffects, inspired by models of sandpiles [11], in order\nto obtain more realistic ripple profiles and to predict the\nripple wavelength and speed. As our work was near-\ning completion we learned of other work in progress on\nripple formation [12] similar in spirit to our own, but with\nimportant differences in implementation.0031-9007\u000199\u000183(24)\u00015170(4)$15.00We consider two-dimensional sand ripples: following\nearlier work on sandpiles [11,13] we assume that the\neffective surface of the ripple comprises a \u201cbare\u201d surface\ndefined by the local heights of clusters h\u0002x, t\u0003 sheathed\nby a thin layer of flowing mobile grains whose local\ndensity is r\u0002x, t\u0003, with x the horizontal coordinate, and\nt time. The ripple evolves under the influence of two\ndistinct types of mechanisms. First, the impact of a\nconstant flux of saltating grains knocks grains out of\nthe bare surface, causing them to hop along the ripple\nsurface and land in the layer of flowing grains. This is\nthe underlying cause of ripple formation. Second, the\nripples are subject to intracluster and intercluster granular\nrelaxation mechanisms which result in a smoothing of\nthe surface.\nFollowing [10] we consider grains to be bounced out\nof the bare surface by a constant incoming saltation flux,\nwhich impacts the sand bed at an angle b to the horizontal.\nThese hopping or \u201creptating\u201d [14] grains subsequently\nland in the flowing layer. The saltating grains are highly\nenergetic and continue in saltation upon rebounding from\nthe sand bed. We assume that the number N\u0002x, t\u0003 of sand\ngrains ejected per unit time, per unit length of the sand\nbed, is proportional to the component of the saltation flux\nperpendicular to the sand surface, giving\nN\u0002x, t\u0003 \u0001 J sin\u0002a 1 b\u0003 \u0001 J\u0002sinb 1 hx cosb\u0003\n\u00021 1 h2x\u00031\u00012\n, (1)\nwhere a \u0001 tan21\u0002hx\u0003, and J is a positive constant of\nproportionality. We assume that each sand grain ejected\nfrom the surface hops a horizontal distance a, with proba-\nbility p\u0002a\u0003, and then lands in the flowing layer. We\nconsider the flight of each sand grain to take place instanta-\nneously, since ripples evolve on a much slower time scale\nthan that of a hop. The hop length distribution p\u0002a\u0003 can\nbe measured experimentally [14,15], so we consider it to\nbe given empirically. It is possible that p\u0002a\u0003 and hence\nthe mean and variance of hop lengths could depend upon\nfactors such as wind speed.

(2)\nThere may be regions on the sand bed which are shielded\nfrom the incoming saltation flux by higher relief upwind.\nIn these regions there will be no grains bounced out of\nthe surface, and there will be no contribution to the ht\nequation from hopping.

The term Dhhxx represents the diffusive re-\narrangement of clusters while the term Drrxx represents\nthe diffusion of the flowing grains. The flux-divergence\nterm x\u0002rhx\u0003x models the flow of surface grains under\ngravity. The current of grains is assumed proportional to\nthe number of flowing grains and to their velocity, which\nin turn is proportional to the local slope to leading or-\nder [10]. The 2krhxx term represents the inertial fillingin of dips and knocking out of bumps on the bare\nsurface caused by rolling grains flowing over the top. The\nlr\u0002jhxj 2 tana\u0003 term represents the tendency of flowing\ngrains to stick onto the ripple surface at small slopes; it is\nmeant to model the accumulation of slowly flowing grains\nat an obstacle. Clearly for this to happen the obstacle\nmust be stable, or else it would be knocked off by the\noncoming grains, so that this term comes into play only\nfor slopes less than tana, where a is the angle of repose.\nThe term n\u0002jhxj 2 tana\u0003 \u0002tan2g 2 h2x\u000321\u00012 represents tilt\nand avalanching; it comes into play only for slopes greater\nthan tana and models the tendency of erstwhile stable\nclusters to shed grains into the flowing layer when tilted.\nThis shedding of grains starts when the surface slope\nexceeds the angle of repose. For slopes approaching\nthe angle g, which is the maximum angle of stability,\nthe rate of tilting out of grains becomes very large: an\navalanche occurs. This term, among other things, is a\nnovel representation of the well-known phenomena of\nbistability and avalanching at the angle of repose [17].\nWe renormalize the model equations setting x !\nx0x\u02dc, t ! t0t\u02dc, a ! x0a\u02dc, r ! r0r\u02dc, h ! h0h\u02dc, where\nx0 \u0001 Dh\u0001apJ cosb, t0 \u0001 Dh\u0001\u0002apJ cosb\u00032, h0 \u0001\nDh tang\u0001apJ cosb, r0 \u0001 apJ sinb\u0001l tana, which gives\nfor 0 # hx # tana\u0001 tang\nht \u0001 \u00021 1 k\u02c6r\u0003hxx 2 r\ntanb\ntana\n\u221a\njhxj 2 tanatang\n!\n2 f\u0002x\u0003 ,\n(9)\nrt \u0001\nh0\nr0\n(\n2k\u02c6rhxx 1 r\ntanb\ntana\n\u221a\njhxj 2 tanatang\n!)\n1\nh0\nr0\nZ 1`\n2`\np\u0002a\u0003f\u0002x 2 a\u0003da\n1\nDr\nDh\nrxx 1 x\u02c6\u0002rhx\u0003x , (10)\nand for tana\u0001 tang # hx , 1\nht \u0001 \u00021 1 k\u02c6r\u0003hxx 2 f\u0002x\u0003 2\nn\u02c6\u0002jhxj 2 tana\u0001 tang\u0003\n\u00021 2 h2x\u00031\u00012\n,\n(11)\nrt \u0001\nh0\nr0\n(\n2k\u02c6rhxx 1\nn\u02c6\u0002jhxj 2 tana\u0001 tang\u0003\n\u00021 2 h2x\u00031\u00012\n)\n1\nh0\nr0\nZ 1`\n2`\np\u0002a\u0003f\u0002x 2 a\u0003 da\n1\nDr\nDh\nrxx 1 x\u02c6\u0002rhx\u0003x , (12)\nwhere the tildes have been dropped and where\nf\u0002x\u0003 \u0001\n\u221a\nhx 1\ntanb\ntang\n!\n\u00021 1 h2x tan\n2g\u000321\u00012, (13)5171\nVOLUME 83, NUMBER 24 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 13 DECEMBER 1999and k\u02c6 \u0001 kr0\u0001Dh, n\u02c6 \u0001 nt0\u0001h0, x\u02c6 \u0001 xh0\u0001Dh. Wher-\never the sand bed is shielded from the saltation flux, the\nhopping term must be suppressed by removing the term\n2f\u0002x\u0003 in the ht equation.\nClose to onset of the instability that gives rise to sand\nripples, the slopes of the sand bed will be small, since\nsurface roughness is of small amplitude; hence the regime\n0 # tana\u0001 tang is relevant. There are no shielded regions\nat early times, since the slope of the bed does not exceed\ntanb. Note that hx \u0001 0, r \u0001 1 is a stationary solution\nof Eqs. (9) and (10). Setting h \u0001 h\u02c6est1ikx and r \u0001\n1 1 r\u02c6est1ikx , where h\u02c6 \u00f8 1 and r\u02c6 \u00f8 1 are constants,\nlinearizing, and Taylor-expanding the integrand gives a\ndispersion relation for s in terms of k. The presence\nof the jhxj term means that strictly we are considering\ndifferent solutions for sections of the ripple where hx . 0\nand sections where hx , 0, but in fact the effect of the\njhx j terms appears only as a contribution 6 tanb\u0001 tana\nto the bracket \u00021 6 tanb\u0001 tana\u0003, where the hx . 0 case\ntakes the 1 sign and hx , 0 case takes the 2 sign.

We have neglected\nhigher order terms as we are looking for long wave modes\nwhere jkj is small, since short waves are damped by the\ndiffusion terms. Sand ripples grow if a\u00af . 1 1 x\u02c6r0\u0001h0,\nwhich is equivalent to requiring that a\u00afapJ cosb .

The wave speed is given by c \u0001\n2Ak2 . 0; it is higher for larger k2 which implies that\nshorter waves move faster, as indeed was seen in the\nnumerical simulations described below. The speed is\nhigher for hx . 0 than for hx , 0, leading to wave\nsteepening.\nThe renormalized model equations (9)\u2013(12) were inte-\ngrated numerically using compact finite differences [18]\nwith periodic boundary conditions. The 2f\u0002x\u0003 term in\nthe ht equation was suppressed in shielded regions. We\nused a normal distribution for the hop lengths with mean a\u00af\nand variance s2. In the run illustrated, we chose a\u00af \u0001 3.1,\ns \u0001 0.1, Dr\u0001Dh \u0001 1.0, h0\u0001r0 \u0001 20.0, x\u02c6 \u0001 0.1, n\u02c6 \u0001\n1.0, k\u02c6 \u0001 0.1, b \u0001 10\u00b1, a \u0001 30\u00b1, and g \u0001 35\u00b1. The\nangles were chosen to agree with observational evidence,\nthe ratio h0\u0001r0 to ensure a thin layer of flowing grains,\nand the remaining parameters to allow ripple growth.\nThe output was rescaled back into physical variables\nusing Dh \u0001 1.0 and l \u0001 10.0. The initial conditions\nfor the dimensionless variables were h \u0001 1.0 1 0.1hh,\nr \u0001 0.95 1 0.1hr , where hh and hr represent random\nnoise generated by random variables on \u00040, 1\u0003 in order\nto model surface roughness. In this case B \u0001 28.47 and\nA \u0001 25.26 (taking the minus sign in the brackets), giving\na preferred wave number of k \u0001 0.352, and a wave speed\nof c \u0001 5.26k2. The length of the integration domain was\nchosen to be 10 times the linearly preferred wavelength.\nFigure 1 shows the surface height at time t \u0001 10.0Dt,\nwhere Dt \u0001 2.78. Note the emergence of a preferred\nwavelength, with wave number k \u0006 0.457 lying in the\npermitted band for growing modes predicted by the\nlinear stability analysis and arrived at by a process of\nripple merger. The wave speed close to onset was also\nmeasured and found to be c \u0006 \u00024.13 6 0.39\u0003k2, which is\nreasonably close to the predicted value. Ripple merger\ntypically occurs when a small fast ripple catches up and\nmerges with a larger slower ripple (Fig. 2), the leading\nripple transferring sand to its pursuer until only the\npursuer remains. Occasionally a small ripple emerges\nfrom the front of the new merged ripple and runs off\nahead.

The height\nto length ratio of the ripples is in the range 1:8\u20131:22,\nwhich is in reasonable agreement with observations [4].\nIn the long time limit, we would expect sand ripples to\ngrow until the maximum lee slope angle reaches an angle\nclose to tang. In reality, there is only a relatively shallow\nlayer of loose sand available for incorportion into ripples,\nand this together with the maximum slope condition will\ndetermine the size of the fully developed ripples.\nIn summary, we have formulated an analytical contin-\nuum model for aeolian sand ripples using a two-species\nmodel embodying intracluster and intercluster relaxation,\nin a description that leads naturally to bistable behavior at\nthe angle of repose, and its cutoff at the maximum angle\nof stability [17]. We have predicted analytically the pre-\nferred ripple wavelength, the wave speed, and the threshold\nsaltation flux required for ripples to form. Our numerical\nFIG. 3.
