Basically the polymers have not provided\nsufficient competitive advantage over other techniques and materials used in\nanalytical chemistry and in separation to warrant their use.. The main reason for this\nlies in a poor understanding of the factors which govern the recognition properties of\nMIPs. The realization of this limitation recently led to the development of a range of\nprojects where researchers re-visited the fundamentals of design and performance of\nimprinted polymers.1,2 This work involved comprehensive analysis of the type and\nconcentration of the monomers used in polymer preparation,3,4 polymerisation\ntemperature,5,6 pressure,7,8 solvent,9,10 polymerisation time and polymer swelling\nproperties.11\nHere we focus on studying another factor critically important for MIP design,initiators\nand their role in forming high performance MIPs. We have used chemometric tools to\nlink together several parameters such as concentration of initiator and polymerisation\ntime for two different initiator molecules, 1,1\u2019-azobis(cyclohexane-1-carbonitrile)\n(ACC) and 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA). It was expected that the\npolymers formed with higher percentages of initiator would be more rigid, which\nwould ensure a more defined shape of imprinting cavities and higher specificity of\nMIPs. On other hand, the lower amounts of initiator would decrease the temperature\nreached in the polymerisation mixture, which is crucial for the formation of good\nquality imprinting cavities. Thus we intended to find a balance between the rigidity of\n3imprinting cavities versus the quality of the imprinting cavities, which would be\nnecessary for the polymer to have good recognition properties. To make the study\ngeneric, we chose two different initiators which have slightly different initiation\nmechanisms.\nMany organic molecules that are stable can undergo bond dissociation when exposed\nto a certain amount of energy (e.g. the thermal energy of ultraviolet light), and can be\nused as initiators of radical polymerisation.12 The appropriate use of the initiator will\ncontrol the degree of the exothermic process of polymerisation. As each initiator has\nits own specific decomposition rate at a given temperature, the concentration and the\ncuring conditions will be of great importance as well.13 Consequently, each initiator\nwill decompose in different ways.\nAzoinitiators (R-N=N-R) normally have tertiary R groups that are able to stabilize the\nincipient radical.14 Figure 1 shows the mechanism of decomposition of the initiator\n1,1-azobis(cyclohexane-1-carbonitrile) used in our experiments.\nCN\nN N\nNC\nCN.

This model system has\nbeen introduced previously for studying the effects of polymerisation temperature and\npressure, time of polymerisation and polymer swelling.6,8,11 The synthesized materials\nwere studied by HPLC and their morphology, swelling data and performance\ncompared. Chemometrics were used to link together several parameters, such as\nconcentration of the initiator and time of the polymerisation, with the performance of\nsynthesized polymers.\nResults and Discussion\nTo analyze the effect of the percentage of initiator on the MIP\u2019s affinity and\nspecificity, different sets of (-)-ephedrine imprinted polymers were synthesized and\npacked in chromatographic columns and tested by HPLC in chloroform with\nhexamethylenediamine (HMDA) for their ability to interact with (+)- and (-)-\nephedrine under similar conditions. In the first set of experiments (Table 1), the\npolymers were initiated by thermo-initiation at 80 0C, using1,1\u2019-azobis(cyclohexane-\n1-carbonitrile) (ACC) as an initiator. In the second set of experiment (Table 2) the\npolymers were initiated under a UV lamp (0.016 W\/cm2) on ice, using 1,1\u2019-\nazobis(cyclohexane-1-carbonitrile) (ACC) as initiator. In the third set of experiments\n(Table 3) the polymers were synthesized under a UV lamp (0.016 W\/cm2) on ice,\nusing 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA).\n6Table 1.

Concentrations of initiator below 1 % were, in most cases, insufficient\nfor the creation of rigid polymers.\nThe result of this evaluation has been expressed in terms of percentage of initiator and\ntime dependence of separation factors for ephedrine enantiomers. The intention was to\nlink together the variation in polymerisation conditions with observed changes in\n8polymer selectivity (expressed as separation factor). Alternatively we could have\nfocused on studying variations in polymer affinity. This would, however, require a\nmultitude of tests of blank polymers, which would dramatically increase the required\nvolume of analytical work and would complicate the data analysis. Due to this, the\nmodel system we chose was focused specifically on studying enantio-separation using\nMIPs. We have noted however, that in all these experiments a direct correlation was\nobserved between polymer affinity and selectivity. Thus the polymers which\ndemonstrated higher separation factors possessed higher affinity (capacity factors) for\nboth enantiomers.\nThe results of testing the synthesized polymers are presented in Figures 3-5. Several\nimportant conclusions can be drawn from this study. Firstly, it can be seen clearly that\nthe thermo-initiation produces polymers with inferior properties as compared with\nphoto-initiation. This is not surprising and as explained earlier, it results from the\nnegative effect which increased temperature has on the complex formation between\ntemplate and functional monomers.6\n9Figure 3. Influence of the polymerisation time and ACC percentage on separation\nfactor (\uf061) for polymers synthesized in the oil bath at 80 0C.\nFigure 4. Influence of the polymerisation time and ACC percentage on separation\nfactor (\uf061) for polymers synthesized under the UV source.\n10\nFigure 5. Influence of the polymerisation time and DMPA percentage on separation\nfactor (\uf061) for polymers synthesized under the UV source.\nSecondly, it can be concluded that on average large concentrations of initiator hve\ndetrimental effects on the recognition properties of synthesized polymers. It could be\npossible that the monomer molecules interfere with the complexation process between\nmonomers and template. A detailed modeling study, performed in our laboratory,\nwhere we looked at the energetics of monomer-template, initiator-template and\ninitiator-monomer interactions, indicated that this is unlikely. A second explanation\nincludes the role of the heat generated during the polymerisation reaction. Thus we\nassume that large concentrations of initiator added to monomer mixture should\nincrease the polymerisation rate and increase the heat of reaction.16 The increased\ntemperature would disrupt the complex formed between template and monomers and\nreduce the affinity and selectivity of MIPs.\n11\nThe temperature profile of polymerisation reactions for all the processes studied is\nshown in Figures 6-8. The temperature of the polymerisation reaction was monitored\nusing a thermocouple placed in the middle of the polymerisation vessel. The\nmonitoring lasted for the first hour,the period which, for this model system,\ndetermines the quality of imprints formed.11\n0 10 20 30\n40 50\nTime (min.)\n1\n2\n3\n4\nInitiator (%\n)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n(\u00baC\n)\nPolimerization time (m\nin.)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n(\u00baC\n)\nFigure 6.

The temperature profile of the polymerisation reactions with different\npercentages of DMPA for the polymers synthesized under the UV source.\n13\nAs expected, larger concentrations of used initiator generated more heat during the\npolymerisation. More heat was also generated during the thermo-initiated than with\nthe UV initiated reaction. By comparing these results with those showing polymer\nperformance (Figures 2-5) it is possible to conclude that the temperature released\nduring polymerisation is at least one of the major factors, if not the major factor,\nwhich determines the variations in polymer performance observed in our experiments.\nWhat was unexpected however, is the observation that there seemed to be no limit to\nthe tendency that the lower quantity of initiator produced polymer with superior\nrecognition abilities. It has been shown before that polymer rigidity is critically\nimportant for enantio-separation.11 It would be reasonable to assume that lower\nconcentration of initiator would lead to larger amounts of non-polymerizable double\nbonds remaining in the polymer and thus produce less rigid polymers. The higher\nconcentration of initiator would lead to the formation of a larger number of free\nradicals and a larger number of growing nuclei and globules which would, however,\nhave smaller size. Polymer composed of smaller globules will have a larger number of\nsmaller pores and a larger surface area. This is consistent with an analysis of nitrogen\nadsorption isotherms (BET) performed for range of MIPs prepared by thermo-\ninitiation (Table 4). In general, MIPs prepared using larger concentrations of initiators\npossessed a larger surface area. The total pore volume and average pore diameter\nvaried however, perhaps due to the porogenic ability of the solvent vapors released\nduring the highly exothermic reaction.8\n14\nTable 4.

Very similar results were obtained for all polymeric systems\nunder investigation.\nFigure 9. Influence of the polymerisation time and ACC percentage on swelling ratio\nfor polymers synthesized under the UV source.\n15\nA correlation does not exist, however, between polymer selectivity and swelling. The\nmost rigid materials prepared using high concentrations of initiator and long\npolymerisation times, were less selective than less rigid MIPs polymerised using low\nconcentrations of initiator. Apparently, high temperatures produced during\npolymerisation with large quantities of initiator overweighed (in negative terms) the\npositive impact of polymer rigidity. The general conclusion made from this work is\nthat in order to achieve the best performance in enantio-separation (and possibly other\ntypes of applications), MIPs should be synthesized over a long period of time using\nlow concentrations of initiator and low temperatures.\nConclusion\nA chemometrics approach has been used to optimise experiments aimed at analysis of\nthe interplay of parameters such as polymerisation time, temperature and percentage\nof initiator and their role in the morphology and the performance of synthesized\nmaterials. The present results demonstrate the importance of keeping the right balance\nbetween various polymerisation conditions. Thus the high polymer rigidity achieved\nwith large concentrations of initiator had a negative impact on polymer performance.\nAt the same time,at low concentrations of initiator, the higher rigidity achieved upon\nlonger polymerisation time had a beneficial effect. This is due to the fact that the high\ntemperatures reached with high concentrations of initiator worsened the quality of\nimprints formed. The lower quantities of initiator the lower was the temperature\ngenerated during polymerisation and the better were the recognition properties of\nMIPs. In general, it can be concluded that MIPs should be synthesized for long period\n16\nof time using low concentrations of initiator and low temperatures. The best\nselectivity was achieved for polymers prepared by photoinitiation with 2,2-\ndimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as initiator. As mentioned before, radical\ngeneration for acetophenone derivatives is a process that is not quenched by oxygen\nand this would be beneficial for many practical applications including sensors.17\nExperimental Section\nChemicals. 1R,2S-ephedrine ((-)-ephedrine) and 2R,1S ephedrine ((+)-ephedrine)\nwere supplied by Chemical Development, GlaxoSmithKline R&D, UK. Ethylene\nglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEM), 1,1\u2019-azobis\n(cyclohexanecarbonitrile), 2,2-dimetoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, hexamethylenedi-\namine (HMDA) and chloroform were purchased from Aldrich (UK). Diethyldithiocar-\nbamic acid benzyl ester was supplied by TCI Europe nv. All chemicals and solvents\nwere analytical or HPLC grade and were used without further purification.\nChemometic optimisation of the experiment. The polymer design and modeling\nwere carried out using MODDE 6.0 software (Umetrics, Sweden) with two factors in\nthe experimental design: (i) the amount of initiator and (ii) the polymerisation time.\nThe influence of these two factors on the separation factor (\u03b1) was modelled by\nmultivariate analysis. A two-level full factorial design was established for each\ninitiator and polymerisation method. In addition, an experiment carried out at the\ncentre of the experimental region was added to determine whether there is a linear or\nnon-linear relationship between the factors and the response (separation factor).\nThe separation factor values obtained with the experimental design were related to the\nexperimental parameters by an empirical model obtained using a partial least squares\n17\n(PLS) regression method. The degree of fit and the prediction ability of the models\nwere taken into account to select the model complexity, i.e., the number of regression\ncoefficients included in the model. The interpretation on the models was assessed by\nthe relative sizes and signs of the coefficients that indicated those that will contribute\nmore strongly to the modelling of the response.4\nPreparation of molecularly imprinted polymers. Several sets of imprinted\npolymers were synthesized with the different initiation methods and different\ninitiators. To a solution of (+)-ephedrine (1.21 mmol, 0.2 g) in chloroform (8.82 g)\nwas added 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (12.1 mmol, 1.57 g), ethylene glycol\ndimethacrylate (35.9 mmol, 7.1 g) and 1,1\u2019-azobis (cyclohexanecarbonitrile) or 2,2-\ndimetoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (0.18, 0.54 or 0.9 g). The monomer mixture was\nplaced in a 50 ml glass tube and purged with nitrogen for 5 minutes. The\npolymerisation was initiated using (i) a fibre optic light source with a 0.016 W\/cm2\nintensity CERMAX\u00ae Xenon Arc Lamp (PerkinElmer Optoelectronics, Inc., USA)\nwith the mixture in an ice bath with NaCl at 0 0C and (ii) using a mineral oil bath at\n80 0C. The variations in experimental conditions used for polymer preparation are\npresented in Tables 1-3. The bulk polymers were ground in methanol and wet-sieved\nthrough 38 \uf06dm sieves (Endecotts, UK) and sedimented in methanol to remove fines.\nThe polymers were additionally washed out with chloroform containing 0.05%\nhexamethylenediamine. Spectrophotometric analysis of ephedrine concentration in\nwashing solutions, performed at 260 nm indicated that 94-95% of the template was\nremoved successfully from the polymer. Polymer particles were collected, dried under\nvacuum and used for packing HPLC columns.\nHPLC analysis. For the analysis of MIP recognition properties the polymer particles\nwere suspended in methanol and packed in stainless steel HPLC columns\n18\n(150x4.6mm) at 1000 bar pressure using 1666 HPLC column Slurry Packer (Alltech,\nUK). The evaluation experiments were carried out using an HPLC system, which\nincluded a ConstaMetric-3200 solvent delivery system (LDC Analytical, UK),\nPerkinElmer ISS-100 automatic injection system and a Waters Lambda-Max Model\n481 LC Detector (UK). The separation was performed at ambient temperature.\nColumns were washed with 0.05% hexamethylenediamine in chloroform at a constant\nflow (1 ml min-1) until a stable baseline was achieved. HPLC analysis was performed\nat a flow-rate of 1.0 ml min-1 and monitored by UV detector at 260 nm. Injection\namounts were 8 \uf06dg (48.5 nmol) in 40 \uf06dl injection volume. All reported\nchromatographic data represent the results of 3 -5 concordant experiments. The\nstandard deviation of the measurements was below 5%.\nCapacity and separation factors. Capacity factors (K\u00b4) were determined from K\u00b4=\n(t - to)\/to, where t is the retention time of a given species and to is the retention time\nof the void marker (acetone). Effective enantioseparation factors (\uf061) were\ncalculated from the relationship: \uf061=K\u00b4(+)\/K\u00b4(-), where K\u00b4(+) and K\u00b4(-) are the\ncapacity factors of the (+)- and (-)-ephedrine, respectively.\nSwelling analysis. Swelling experiments were performed as described previously.\nPolymer particles (300 mg) with a mesh size of 38-67 \uf06dm were packed in 1 ml solid-\nphase extraction cartridges (Supelco, UK). The cartridges were then filled with 1 ml\nof chloroform. After 6 hours equilibration at 20 oC, the excess solvent was removed\nfrom the polymer by applying reduced pressure for 1 minute and the weight of the\nswollen polymer was measured. The swelling ratio (Sr) of the polymers was\ncalculated from the following equation:\nSr = vs\/vo (1)\nWhere vs is the volume of the swollen polymer and vo is the volume of dry polymer.\n19\nPorosity and surface analysis. The determinations of specific surface area were\nperformed using a NOVA \"e\" surface area and pore size analyser (Quantachrome)\nbased on the nitrogen BET. The adsorption and desorption of nitrogen was used to\nmeasure the specific surface area of materials and also the pore size and distribution.\nBefore gas adsorption, the powdered polymer sample (300 mg) was degassed and\ndried in a vacuum at 100 \u00b0C for 2 hours.\n20\nCaptures to Figures.\nFigure 1.
