Introduction\n[2] Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars\n(GOMOS) onboard the European satellite Envisat is an\ninstrument for the retrieval of stratospheric and mesospheric\nspecies that exhibit absorption lines in the UV-visible and\nnear infrared domain [Bertaux et al., 2004; Kyro\u00a8la\u00a8 et al.,\n2004]. GOMOS performs measurements using the stellar\noccultation method during the setting of stars, allowing\nmainly the retrieval of the vertical profiles of ozone, NO2,\nNO3, the extinction coefficient of aerosols (at 500 nm) and\nestimation of its wavelength dependence. GOMOS was\nmainly dedicated to evaluate accurately the ozone trend at\nall latitudes, in the stratosphere and the mesosphere. Nev-\nertheless, the other measurements can help to better docu-\nment stratospheric nitrogen chemistry at different latitudes,\nand to estimate the aerosol content in the lower and middle\nstratosphere.\n[3] GOMOS allows nighttime measurements of NO3 that\ncannot be observed during daytime and of NO2 around its\nmaximum concentration over its diurnal cycle. Also, OClO\n[Fussen et al., 2006] and water vapor can be tentatively\nretrieved from the GOMOS measurements. The use of\ndifferent stars, typically brighter than magnitude 3, allows\nthe instrument to obtain an almost global coverage which\ncannot be achieved when the Sun is used as a light source.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A02302, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012345, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1LPCE-CNRS\/Universite\u00b4 d\u2019Orle\u00b4ans, Orle\u00b4ans cedex 2, France.\n2LOA\/CNRS, Villeneuve d\u2019Ascq cedex, France.\n3IASB, Brussels, Belgium.\n4Service d\u2019Ae\u00b4ronomie, Verrie`res le Buisson cedex, France.\n5Institut fu\u00a8r Meteorologie und Klimaforschung, Forschungszentrum\nKarlsruhe GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany.\n6British Antarctic Survey\/NERC, Cambridge, UK.\n7European Space Agency, ESTEC-SMS, Noordwijk, Netherlands.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012345$09.00\nA02302 1 of 20\nIn particular, GOMOS can provide unique measurements\nduring the winter polar night.\n[4] As done for many satellite instruments it is necessary\nto validate the GOMOS profiles in order to estimate the\naccuracy of individual profiles and to search for possible\nbias both in altitude registration and in the absolute values\nof the species concentrations. An intensive validation work\nhas been conducted between ozone lidar, ozone sounding,\nmicrowave radiometer and GOMOS measurements, and no\nbias was found statistically [Meijer et al., 2004]. Marchand\net al. [2004] have analyzed the self-consistency of GOMOS\nNO3, NO2 and O3 data using chemical data assimilation;\nthey also came to the same conclusion, although the NO2\nand NO3 comparisons show very scattered results.\n[5] Another validation exercise is to conduct direct val-\nidation of the individual GOMOS profiles. Since GOMOS\nuses different stars with different magnitudes and colors, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio can vary from one profile to another.\nThen it is necessary to conduct the direct validation of the\nGOMOS profiles when different stars are observed. This\ncan be done at different latitudes and during different\ngeophysical conditions using balloon-borne instruments that\ncan perform measurements from the tropopause up to\naltitudes in the 30\u201340 km range. It is obvious that such\nan exercise is a set of \u2018\u2018one-shot\u2019\u2019 validations mainly\ndedicated to evaluate the absolute accuracy of each indi-\nvidual profile. Nevertheless, an estimation of bias can be\nconducted if enough balloon profiles are available.\n[6] This direct validation will concern vertical profiles of\nozone, of NO2, of NO3 and of the aerosol extinction\ncoefficient. It will not be conducted for water vapor and\nOClO since their retrievals are difficult and the individual\nprofiles are not accurate enough. The validation will not be\nconducted for high resolution temperatures profiles because\nno balloon-borne temperature profiles are available at the\nexact place of the GOMOS measurements.\n[7] Three different steps will be conducted. First, the\nGOMOS vertical profiles and balloon profiles will be\ncompared. Secondly, a statistical analysis will be conducted\nin order to estimate the accuracy of the profiles. Thirdly, the\nGOMOS transmission spectra will be reanalyzed using an\nalgorithm similar to those used for balloon instruments that\nperform remote sensing measurements in the UV-visible, in\norder to evaluate the \u2018\u2018operational GOMOS\u2019\u2019 processor. A\nspecific section will be dedicated to the aerosol retrievals.\n2. Ballon-Borne Instruments and Validation\nCampaigns\n[8] Six balloon-borne instruments have been used in\ndedicated campaigns for the GOMOS validation: Absorp-\ntion par les Minoritaire Ozone et NOx (AMON), Micro\nRadiome`tre Ballon (MicroRADIBAL), Michelson Interfer-\nometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS-B2),\nSpectroscopie d\u2019Absorption Lunaire pour l\u2019Observation\ndes Minoritaires Ozone et NOx (SALOMON), Spectrosco-\npie d\u2019Absorption pour l\u2019Observation Ze\u00b4nitale (SAOZ), and\nSpectrome`tre Infra Rouge d\u2019Absorption par Diodes Laser\nEmbarque\u00b4es (SPIRALE). AMON is a UV-visible spectrom-\neter which, just like GOMOS, uses stars as light source\n[Renard et al., 1996]. Its ozone, NO2 and NO3 measure-\nments will be used for validation. MicroRADIBAL is a\nradiometer measuring the sunlight scattered by the atmo-\nsphere in the near infra red, at 730 nm and 865 nm\n[Brogniez et al., 2003]. Its detected radiances are converted\nto aerosol extinction using Mie scattering calculations and\nwill be used for comparison with GOMOS aerosol extinc-\ntion. MIPAS-B2 is a limb viewing Fourier Transform Infra-\nRed (FTIR) Spectrometer [Friedl-Vallon et al., 2004; Wetzel\net al., 2006], like MIPAS onboard Envisat. Its ozone and\nNO2 measurements will be used for validation. SALOMON\nis a UV-visible spectrometer using the Moon as a light\nsource [Renard et al., 2000]. Its ozone, NO2, NO3 and\naerosol extinction measurements will be used for validation.\nSAOZ is a UV-visible spectrometer using the Sun as light\nsource [Pommereau and Piquard, 1994]. Its ozone measure-\nments will be used for validation. SPIRALE is a tunable\ndiode laser absorption spectrometer [Moreau et al., 2005],\nallowing in situ measurements of species. Its ozone and\nNO2 measurements will be used for validation. Ozone\nsoundings have been performed during one SALOMON\nflight at mid latitudes and during one SPIRALE flight at\nhigh latitudes, in order to check the consistency between the\ndifferent types of measurements.\n[9] All the balloon instruments except SPIRALE per-\nformed remote sensing measurements, as do satellite instru-\nments. The validation exercise conducted here will mainly\nconcern vertical profiles obtained after performing a spatial\ninversion. These profiles could differ from \u2018\u2018real\u2019\u2019 vertical\ndistribution of the species that could be obtained by in situ\nmeasurements, in particular if local enhancements are\npresent. This is discussed in detail in the paper of Berthet\net al. [2007].\n[10] The collocation criterion we adopted between\nGOMOS and balloon measurements (considered at the\nmiddle of the flight trajectory) are roughly less than 500\nkm in the same geophysical conditions (this is essential at\nhigh latitude when the vortex is present) and less than 3 h,\nexcept for ozone and aerosol extinction where the time\ncriteria can be extended to 6 h. In fact, it is difficult to\nprovide a meaningful accurate estimation of the time and\ndistance collocations between GOMOS and balloon meas-\nurements. This problem is due to the relative motion of the\nsatellite and of the balloon, to the fact that balloon measure-\nments take tens of minutes instead of less than 1 minute for\nGOMOS, and to the retrievals (expect for SPIRALE) that\nassume horizontal homogeneous layers from tens to few\nhundred kilometers.\n[11] Five validation campaigns were conducted at differ-\nent latitudes and during different geophysical conditions\nbetween 2002 and 2006 involving GOMOS observations\nusing bright and weak stars. At mid latitudes balloons were\nlaunched from Aire sur l\u2019Adour, France (latitude 42\u0001430N,\nlongitude 0\u0001150W), and at high latitude from Kiruna,\nNorthern Sweden (latitude 67\u0001530N, longitude 21\u0001050E);\ndetails are given in Table 1. Validation was conducted in\nMarch 2003 during a Polar Stratospheric Cloud event (PSC)\n[Alfred et al., 2006] located at altitudes between 21 and\n26 km, and in March 2004 just outside the polar vortex.\n[12] In the following, comparison between operational\nGOMOS V5.0 data and balloon-borne measurements will\nbe performed in the altitude range where both profiles are\navailable. Some GOMOS data are sometimes available at\naltitudes lower than balloon measurements (with large\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n2 of 20\nA02302\nerrors bars) but will not be taken into account. The GOMOS\nvertical sampling is about 1.5 km; the real vertical reso-\nlutions, given in the Product Handbook of the GOMOS\ndata, are larger. They are 2 km below 30 km and 3 km\nabove for ozone, and 4 km for NO2, NO3 and aerosols. The\nGOMOS sampling is close to the 1-km vertical sampling\nused commonly for balloon-borne instrument retrievals\n(except for the in situ SPIRALE measurements that have\na vertical resolution less than 50 m). The real vertical\nresolutions of the balloon profiles can differ from one\ninstrument to another, but it is commonly assumed that\nballoon instruments have a vertical resolution similar or\nbetter than satellites instruments. We can postulate, at least\nas a first approximation, that all measurements have similar\nvertical resolution, allowing direct comparisons without\nsmoothing procedures (except for SPIRALE). In any case,\ndifferences in resolution can affect the estimation of the\nabsolute values of concentrations mainly where a profile\nexhibits strong vertical gradients but do not act significantly\non the estimation of the total content of the species in the\nstratosphere.\n[13] It must be noticed that although the measurements\nare performed in same geophysical conditions, small-scale\nvariations of the species concentrations could occur be-\ntween the locations of GOMOS and of the balloon measure-\nments. The path length of GOMOS lines of sight in the\natmosphere is longer than those of balloon-borne instru-\nments, minimizing their relative contribution to the total\nestimation of the slant column densities. These variations\nwill have less influence on the GOMOS retrievals than on\nthe balloon retrievals [Berthet et al., 2007]. Then, some\n(small) differences could appear during the comparison of\nthe individual profiles, but they could disappear when\nperforming a statistical analysis using all the profiles.\n3.

Comparison between ozone measurements by GOMOS, SALOMON and ozone sounding, at\nmidlatitudes.\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n3 of 20\nA02302\nFigures 4\u20139 present the comparison at high latitudes. Ozone\nsoundings on Figure 1 and on Figure 9 are in excellent\nagreement with balloon measurements, confirming the ac-\ncuracy of the instruments used for the validation. In Figure\n1, the GOMOS profile exhibits a significant overestimation\nwhen compared to SALOMON; also, the altitude of the\nconcentration maximum detected by GOMOS is higher. In\nFigure 6, the GOMOS profile is underestimated when\ncompared to SAOZ, and the altitude of maximum concen-\ntration is higher. In Figure 5, the agreement between the\nAMON profiles using two different stars and the GOMOS\nprofile is poor. The presence of PSCs in the 21\u201326 km\naltitude range can induce strong low frequency spectral\nfluctuations [Rivie`re et al., 2000] that affect the species\nretrieval. Indeed, some unrealistic undulations are present in\nthe vertical profiles, confirming that the retrieval using\nremote sensing measurement is difficult when PSCs are\npresent. Finally, some GOMOS profiles are also in very\ngood agreement with balloon measurements, as presented in\nFigure 8. Then, no systematic discrepancies can be pointed\nout.\nFigure 2. Comparison between ozone measurements by GOMOS and MIPAS-B2, at midlatitudes\n(MIPAS-B2 error bars comprise random and systematic error components).\nFigure 3. Comparison between ozone measurements by GOMOS and SALOMON, at midlatitudes.\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n4 of 20\nA02302\n[15] Excluding the measurements during the PSC event,\nthe 8 case studies presented above can be used in order to\nevaluate the accuracy of GOMOS. The difference between\nthe altitudes of maximum concentration of GOMOS and\nballoon-borne measurements is calculated for each case-\nstudy. The 8 values are then averaged, giving a mean\ndifference of 1.5 \u00b1 2.5 km. Since the GOMOS vertical\nresolution is 2 km in this part of the stratosphere, this\ndifference for altitude estimation is not significant. This\nresult is in agreement with the conclusion obtained by\nMeijer et al. [2004]. The same method is applied for the\ndifference between concentration maxima. Above 15 km,\nthe mean difference is 9.2 \u0003 1010 \u00b1 6.1 \u0003 1011 molecule\ncm\u00023 corresponding to a bias of about 1.5% (assuming a\nmean concentration maximum of 6 \u0003 1012 molecule cm\u00023)\nand uncertainty of 10% for the individual profiles (the error\nis calculated at 1-s RMS).\n[16] Figure 10 presents the relative errors calculated by\ndividing the difference between GOMOS and balloon\nprofiles by the balloon profile, for each case study. The\ndifferences are then averaged when at least 4 profiles are\navailable in a vertical range of 2 km. The standard error of\nthe mean is calculated from the standard error divided by\nthe square root of the number of profiles used for the\nFigure 4. Comparison between ozone measurements by GOMOS and SPIRALE, at high latitudes.\nFigure 5. Comparison between ozone measurements by GOMOS and AMON, at high latitudes (two\nprofiles using the stars Sirius and Alnilam were available for AMON measurements). PSCs were present\nat altitudes between 21 and 26 km.\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n5 of 20\nA02302\ncalculation. Even with a low number of profiles, no signif-\nicant bias is present in the GOMOS profiles in the middle\nstratosphere between 17 and 30 km, with an average value\nof \u00020.3 %. The 1-s error is 10 % between 20 and 30 km,\nconfirming the result previously obtained with the concen-\ntration maxima. The vertical profiles can be converted into\nvertical columns in order to estimate the total amount of\nozone in the stratosphere above 15 km. The average\ndifference between GOMOS and balloon-borne vertical\ncolumns is close to zero (\u00021.9 \u0003 1015 molecule cm\u00022,\nfor an average total column of 6.9 \u0003 1018 molecule cm\u00022)\nin agreement with the results presented in Figure 10 for\nconcentrations; the 1-s error is about than 1%. These results\nprove the ability to use GOMOS for global trend studies of\nozone in the middle stratosphere, excluding the measure-\nments obtained during PSCs events.\n[17] The GOMOS individual profiles are inaccurate in the\nlower stratosphere below 17 km down to the tropopause,\nwhen compared to balloon profiles. This problem prevents\nfrom using individual profiles for case studies in this part of\nFigure 6.

Comparison Results for NO2\n[18] Figures 11\u201313 present the comparison between NO2\nGOMOS and balloon measurements at midlatitudes, and\nFigures 14\u201318 present the comparison at high latitudes. In\nthe middle stratosphere the profiles are qualitatively in\nagreement. Some strong discrepancies occur in the lower\nstratosphere (below 20 km), in particular during the PSC\nevent (Figure 15), or sometimes when secondary concen-\ntration peaks are present. These additional peaks could be\ndue to dynamics when air masses originating from different\nlatitudes remain vertically unmixed, and\/or when charged\nparticles originating from a solar eruption produce strong\nlocal enhancement in NOx content [Seppa\u00a8la\u00a8 et al., 2004;\nRandall et al., 2005; Renard et al., 2006]. The presence of\nsuch (local) enhancements disrupts the assumption of\nspherical symmetry used in the retrieval, especially if their\nsize is smaller than the path length of the line of sight (of the\norder of few hundreds kilometers in the lower stratosphere).\nThis can produce inaccurate profiles containing artificial\nvertical enhancements [Berthet et al., 2007] at altitudes\ndepending on the geometry of the measurements.\nFigure 8. Comparison between ozone measurements by GOMOS and SALOMON, at high latitudes.\nFigure 9. Comparison between ozone measurements by GOMOS, SPIRALE and ozone sounding, at\nhigh latitudes (only few SPIRALE errors bars are plotted for clarity).\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n7 of 20\nA02302\n[19] Excluding the measurements during the PSC event,\nthe 7 profiles studied here are averaged in order to evaluate\nthe accuracy of GOMOS. The difference for the altitude of\nmaximum concentration is 0.7 \u00b1 1.3 km, which is smaller\nthan the GOMOS vertical resolution of 4 km. In the middle\nstratosphere above 20 km, the mean of the differences of the\nmaximum concentration is 2.0 \u0003 107 \u00b1 3.3 \u0003 108 molecule\ncm\u00023, corresponding to a bias of about 1% (assuming a\nmean concentration maximum of 2 \u0003 109 molecule cm\u00023)\nand uncertainty of 17% (calculated at 1-s rms).\n[20] Figure 19 presents the relative errors calculated by\ndividing the difference between GOMOS and balloon\nprofiles by the balloon profile, for each case study. As done\npreviously for ozone, the differences are averaged when at\nleast 4 profiles are available in a vertical range of 2 km. The\n1-s error is about 25 % in the 25\u201333 km altitude range, and\nFigure 10. Relative differences between balloon and GOMOS profiles (full lines) for ozone.

This value is significantly\nhigher than the one calculated for the concentration maxi-\nma. In fact, this difference percentage calculation is dom-\ninated by the results of high latitudes, with small amounts of\nNO2 in the middle and lower stratosphere, like those\nmeasured below 24 km by SPIRALE on 20 January 2006\n(Figure 18). The calculation of the standard error of the\nmean shows no bias.\n[21] The vertical profiles are converted into vertical\ncolumns in order to estimate the total amount of NO2 above\n20 km. The average difference between GOMOS and\nballoon-borne vertical columns is close to zero (\u00024.4 \u0003\n1012 molecule cm\u00022, for an average total column of 2.3 \u0003\n1015 molecule cm\u00022), with a 1-s RMS error of 2%. These\nresults show that there is no bias for the retrieval of the\nglobal amount of NO2 in the middle stratosphere. In the\nlower stratosphere, the GOMOS NO2 retrievals are inaccu-\nFigure 12.

Comparison Results for NO3\n[22] Figures 20\u201321 present the comparison of NO3 be-\ntween GOMOS and the few balloon-borne measurements at\nmidlatitudes, and Figures 22\u201323 present the comparison at\nhigh latitudes. The retrieval of NO3 is difficult since only\ntwo large absorptions lines are present in the visible domain,\nof which the first one is contaminated by an O2 absorption\nline [Renard et al., 2005a]. The retrieval from the other line\nis difficult as it comes close to the detection limit of\nGOMOS detector resulting from the short exposure time\n(0.5 s) and the weakness of the absorption. At midlatitudes,\none profile is in agreement with balloon measurements\n(Figure 21) and the other one is in disagreement with\nballoon measurements (Figures 20 and 22). Nevertheless,\nthe deduced GOMOS and balloon-borne vertical columns\nare in reasonable agreement for both profiles. At high\nlatitudes, very small amounts of NO3 are expected during\nthe polar night and under these circumstances measure-\nments are difficult. When balloon data can be retrieved, then\nthe comparison with GOMOS shows that the GOMOS error\nbars are realistic even if the profiles are very noisy.\n[23] The same statistical analysis conducted for ozone\nand NO2 cannot be done is this comparison. Following the\nconclusion of Marchand et al. [2004] the GOMOS data can\nFigure 14. Comparison between NO2 measurements by GOMOS and SPIRALE, at high latitudes.\nFigure 15.

Retrievals of GOMOS Profiles Using the\n\u2018\u2018LPCE Processor\u2019\u2019\n[24] We have shown above that the vertical columns (i.e.,\ntotal amount) of ozone and NO2 for GOMOS and balloon\nmeasurements are in excellent agreement, although the\nvarious instruments have their own dedicated algorithms\nfor the retrievals. The ozone and NO2 GOMOS data are\nhighly accurate for climatology studies and for retrieving\ntrends in the middle stratosphere, but the individual profiles\nhave sometimes a poor accuracy that prevents them from\nbeing used for specific studies like troposphere-stratosphere\nexchange, ozone filamentation, or local chemical processes\nin the polar vortex. This problem could be due to the use of\nvarious stars, leading to fluxes varying from one occultation\nto another.\n[25] It could be interesting to know if similar results or\nimprovements can be obtained in the GOMOS retrievals,\nFigure 16. Comparison between NO2 measurements by GOMOS and SALOMON, at high latitudes.\nFigure 17. Comparison between NO2 measurements by GOMOS and SALOMON, at high latitudes.\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n11 of 20\nA02302\nusing another algorithm, hereafter called the \u2018\u2018LPCE pro-\ncessor\u2019\u2019, derived from those commonly used for balloon\ninstruments that perform remote sensing measurements in\nthe UV-visible [e.g., Renard et al., 2000; Berthet et al.,\n2002]. Such reanalysis of the GOMOS transmissions allow\nthe comparison between GOMOS and balloon profiles\nretrieved with the same method, and then the evaluation\nof the spectral and spatial inversion methods included in the\n\u2018\u2018operational GOMOS\u2019\u2019 processor.\n[26] The V5.0 GOMOS species retrievals are performed\nusing a \u2018\u2018global inversion\u2019\u2019. This means that all the species\nare retrieved simultaneously using the atmospheric trans-\nmissions in the whole spectral range from UV to near infra\nred. This method allows us the use of the UV domain for the\nretrieval of ozone in the mesosphere and in the high\nstratosphere, for which the ozone absorptions are too low\nin the visible domain. Nevertheless, two main problems\ncould occur with this method. First, it does not high-pass\nfilter the transmission spectrum, so the absolute calibration\nof the spectra relative to that obtained outside the atmo-\nsphere at the beginning of the occultation must be main-\ntained. Hence local wavelength dependence of extinctions\nFigure 18. Comparison between NO2 measurements by GOMOS and SPIRALE, at high latitudes.\nFigure 19. Relative differences between balloon and GOMOS profiles (full lines) for NO2. The central\ndashed line represents the mean difference taking into account all the flights (averaged over 2-km in\nvertical) with the standard error of the mean; the external dashed lines represent the \u00b11-s RMS error.\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n12 of 20\nA02302\nproduced by clouds and aerosols, if incorrectly retrieved for\nany reason, could affect the ozone retrieval. The second\nproblem is the chromatic scintillation [Renard et al., 2001],\nwhich produces low frequency oscillations in the transmis-\nsion spectra. This phenomenon can induce artificial oscil-\nlations in the vertical profiles; then a dedicated smoothing\nprocedure or a regularization must be applied [Kyro\u00a8la\u00a8 et al.,\n1993, 2004; Fussen et al., 2005].\n[27] For ozone, the \u2018\u2018LPCE processor\u2019\u2019 uses the spectral\nwindow 450 to 680 nm, and a Differential Optical Absorp-\ntion Spectroscopy (DOAS) method [Platt, 1994], as com-\nmonly applied to balloon measurements in this spectral\ndomain. First, the transmission spectra are vertically aver-\naged (sliding smoothing procedure over 3 consecutive\nspectra), which minimizes efficiently the effect of the\nchromatic scintillation, as shown by Renard et al. [1996,\n2003]. Secondly, the low frequency structures can be\nremoved using the DOAS procedure, minimizing the effect\nof the residual chromatic scintillation and removing the\ncontribution of aerosols.\n[28] The algorithm has been tested for few tens of\nGOMOS occultations (outside the validation collocations).\nThe algorithm is robust and does not produce unrealistic\nFigure 20. Comparison between NO3 measurements by GOMOS and SALOMON, at midlatitudes.\nFigure 21. Comparison between NO3 measurements by GOMOS and SALOMON, at midlatitudes.\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n13 of 20\nA02302\nresults. Then it can be used \u2018\u2018in routine\u2019\u2019 for the validation\ncase-studies presented above.\n[29] For some cases, the improvements are significant\n(Figure 24), producing a better agreement between GOMOS\nand balloon profiles both for the estimation of concentration\nmaximum and of its altitude; for the other cases, only slight\nchanges are obtained. After applying these improvements\nfor all the ozone cases studied above, the difference for the\naltitude concentration maxima is 0.3 \u00b1 1.9 km (instead of\n1.5 \u00b1 2.5 km); the difference of the maxima of concen-\ntrations is now \u00021.2 \u0003 1010 \u00b1 4.0 \u0003 1011 cm\u00023 (instead of\n9.2 \u0003 1010 \u00b1 6.1 \u0003 1011 molecule cm\u00023), corresponding to a\nbias of about 0.2 % and slightly reducing the uncertainty to\nabout 7 %. Nevertheless, the total uncertainty on the\nindividual profiles is not reduced.\n[30] The \u2018\u2018operational GOMOS\u2019\u2019 retrieval uses an \u2018\u2018iter-\native DOAS\u2019\u2019 method for the NO2 and NO3 retrievals,\ncombining a DOAS technique and the global inversion.\nFor NO2, the \u2018\u2018LPCE processor\u2019\u2019 uses DOAS method\nrestricting the spectral domain to 420 to 550 nm. The peaks\nof maximum concentrations can be better estimated, both in\nterm of altitude and of absolute values, as seen in Figure 25.\nConsidering all the NO2 profiles presented above, the\ndifference for the altitude of maximum concentration is\nFigure 22. Comparison between NO3 measurements by GOMOS and AMON, at high latitudes.\nFigure 23.

Nevertheless,\nuncertainties for the values of concentration maximum\nand for the individual profiles are not significantly reduced.\nThen, this procedure could sometimes help in better esti-\nmating the altitude(s) of the peak(s), in particular when\nsecondary enhancements are present (as in Figure 25) but\ncould not help decreasing the uncertainty.\n[31] Similar conclusions are obtained for NO3. The re-\ntrieval is conducted using the spectral domain restricted\nfrom 655 to 670 nm and centered on the strongest absorp-\ntion line. Improvements in the shape of the vertical profile\ncan be obtained sometimes, as shown in Figure 26, without\nreducing the uncertainty.\n[32] In conclusion, similar statistical results are obtained\nusing the \u2018\u2018operational GOMOS\u2019\u2019 processor and the \u2018\u2018LPCE\nFigure 24.

Comparison Results for Aerosol Extinction\n[33] In general, the validation of aerosol satellite measure-\nments consists of making comparisons of total aerosol\ncontent and surface area densities, assuming a priori size\ndistributions and a known refractive index [Russell et al.,\n1996; Randall et al., 2000; Deshler et al., 2003]. Never-\ntheless, previous works [Berthet et al., 2002; Renard et al.,\n2005b] have shown that the wavelength dependence of\nextinction in the UV-visible domain could exhibit spectral\ncolor effects that cannot be reproduced using such assump-\ntions due to the presence of a mixture of solid particles and\nliquid droplets. Also, the surface area density could be a\npoor indicator of the absolute content of aerosols and does\nFigure 26. As Figure 24, but for NO3.\nFigure 27. Wavelength dependence of aerosol extinction measured by SALOMON at high latitudes,\ncompared to GOMOS reference value at 500 nm. The error is of 1 \u0003 10\u00024 km\u00021.\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n16 of 20\nA02302\nnot allow us to distinguish between the various families of\nparticles [Renard et al., 2002]. Hence we propose here a\ndifferent approach for validation, by making a direct com-\nparison of the wavelength dependence of the spectral\nextinction.\n[34] The aerosol extinction is given at 500 nm in the\nGOMOS V5.0 files. The values at this wavelength can be\nused in particular for establishing a global climatology of\naerosol content [Vanhellemont et al., 2005]. The wavelength\ndependence of extinction, also available in the files, is given\nin respect to these \u2018\u2018reference\u2019\u2019 values at 500 nm, in the\nform of a second order polynomial. The \u2018\u2018global inversion\u2019\u2019\nmethod used for the retrieval could be very sensitive to\nFigure 28. Wavelength dependence of aerosol extinction measured by GOMOS at high latitudes, using\nthe brightest star (Sirius, magnitude \u00021.4).\nFigure 29. Wavelength dependence of aerosol extinction measured by GOMOS using the LPCE\nprocessor, compared to GOMOS reference value at 500 nm.\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n17 of 20\nA02302\nnoise and to the chromatic scintillation, which can produce\nartifacts.\n[35] There was only one SALOMON flight, on 16 Jan-\nuary 2006 from Kiruna (Figure 27), during which GOMOS\nmade its observations on the brightest available star, which\nis Sirius. The measurements with SALOMON were con-\nducted during the ascent of the balloon, with a positive\nMoon elevation (i.e., Moon above the gondola horizon),\nproducing lines of sight with shorter path lengths than for\nmeasurements performed at float altitude during the setting\nor the rising of the Moon. The wavelength dependence of\naerosol extinction was determined from 400 to 700 nm\nusing a fourth order polynomial, allowing us to capture the\nnon-monotonic wavelength dependence of the extinction\nFigure 30. Wavelength dependence of aerosol extinction measured by GOMOS at high latitudes, using\na weak star (magnitude 2.7).\nFigure 31. Reference aerosol extinction measured by GOMOS at 500 nm, compared to\nMicroRADIBAL extinction, and to GOMOS extinction in the red domain using the \u2018\u2018LPCE processor\u2019\u2019.\nA02302 RENARD ET AL.: VALIDATION OF GOMOS-ENVISAT\n18 of 20\nA02302\nproduced by the solid particles [Renard et al., 2005b]. The\nerror, coming from 1-s RMS calculation, is of 1 \u0003 10\u00024\nkm\u00021 at all altitudes and wavelengths. It can be noticed that\nSALOMON extinction profiles, exhibit fluctuations of\naerosol content in the middle stratosphere. The presence\nof such local enhancements, confirmed by an aerosol\ncounter onboard the gondola (Renard, J.-B., et al., Vertical\ndistribution of the different types of aerosols in the strato-\nsphere - 1. Detection of liquid particles, interplanetary\nmaterial and soot, and analysis of their spatial variability\nusing the baloon-borne instruments STAC, SALOMON and\nMicro-RADIBAL, and the satellite instrument GOMOS-\nEnvisat, submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research,\n2007), produce some artificial negative values during the\nretrieval as shown in Figure 27.\n[36] The GOMOS wavelength dependence is presented in\nFigure 28. The vertical profiles are smoother than for\nSALOMON; the path length of the GOMOS line of sight\nis at least ten times longer than for SALOMON, thus\ndiluting the contribution of the local enhancements. The\nGOMOS and SALOMON profiles are in fair agreement\nboth for estimating the aerosol extinction and its wavelength\ndependence, in particular below 23 km with extinction\nlower in the red domain than in the blue.\n[37] As with the other species, we can tentatively apply\nthe \u2018\u2018LPCE processor\u2019\u2019 to the GOMOS data, restricting the\nspectral domain to 400 to 700 nm (Figure 29). Excluding\nthe UV domain is motivated by the fact that the signal-to-\nnoise ratio is low in this domain due to the weak flux of the\nstar and the strong effect of Rayleigh scattering. With this\nmethod, the local enhancements of aerosol content as well\nas the presence of particles above 23 km are better retrieved.\n[38] Another validation exercise has been conducted\nwhen GOMOS was using a weak star as a light source,\non 8 March 2004 above Kiruna. This time, as expected, the\nwavelength dependence (Figure 30) exhibits strong oscil-\nlations that are unrealistic. As above, the \u2018\u2018LPCE processor\u2019\u2019\nhas been applied to the transmissions in order to test its\nability to retrieve the wavelength dependence of aerosols in\nsuch conditions. Figure 31 presents the comparison between\nGOMOS reference data at 500 nm with the MicroRADI-\nBAL extinction in the near infra red and the GOMOS\nextinctions in the red domain obtained with the \u2018\u2018LPCE\nprocessor\u2019\u2019. The 500 nm GOMOS data appear to be too\nhigh in the lower stratosphere and to be too low in the\nmiddle stratosphere, although the vertical columns are in\ngood agreement. Significant improvement can be obtained\nusing the LPCE processor. In this case, the extinction\nprofiles in the red domain (at 675 and 700 nm) are close\nto MicroRADIBAL results, and the presence of aerosols in\nthe middle stratosphere is better estimated. Nevertheless, the\n\u2018\u2018LPCE-processor\u2019\u2019 retrieval is inaccurate below 20 km\nwhere the profiles at 675 and 700 nm are vertically\nuncorrelated.\n8. Conclusion\n[39] The \u2018\u2018one shot\u2019\u2019 validation exercise of GOMOS\nmeasurements conducted with different balloon-borne\ninstruments has allowed us to estimate the accuracy of\nGOMOS measurements in different geophysical conditions.\nThe balloon and GOMOS ozone and NO2 vertical columns\nare in excellent agreement in the middle stratosphere. The\naccuracy of individual ozone profiles in the middle strato-\nsphere is about 10% for ozone; the accuracy is about 25 %\nfor NO2 profiles although the estimation for the concentra-\ntion maximum is 17 %. As for most of satellite measure-\nments, the retrievals are difficult in the lower stratosphere\nand the individual profiles must be used cautiously. On the\nother hand, the NO3 retrieval is difficult even in the middle\nstratosphere and only studies with averaged data can be\nconducted. At least for the two GOMOS measurements\nconsidered here, the aerosol content is well estimated but\nthe estimation of the wavelength dependence must be\nanalyzed only when the brightest stars are observed by\nGOMOS. Some improvements can be made for better\nestimating the wavelength dependence of aerosol extinction,\nperforming the retrievals in a spectral window restricted to\nthe visible domain.\n[40] It can be concluded that GOMOS has fully respected\nits primary objective for the study of the trends of species in\nthe middle stratosphere, for which the profiles are used in a\nstatistical manner. On the other hand, some individual\nprofiles could be partly inaccurate, in particular in the lower\nstratosphere. Improvements could be obtained by reprocess-\ning some transmissions in case of specific studies in the\nmiddle and lower stratosphere.\n[41] Acknowledgments.
