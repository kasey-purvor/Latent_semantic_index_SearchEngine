Introduction\nIncreasing investors\u2019 interest in emerging markets has motivated a spate of research aimed at\nunderstanding the return and risk characteristics of stock prices in these markets. Particularly,\ninvestors have been keen on identifying any signals of informational inefficiency that could\nbe potentially exploited to make large economic gains. Whilst previous studies have shown\nthat emerging markets are complex and their behaviour is influenced by a number of factors,\nresearch on individual emerging markets is considered valuable since it does contribute in\nfurthering our understanding of the factors driving returns and volatility in these fast\ndeveloping markets (Erb et al., 1997; Poshakwale, 2001). Stock indexes are frequently used in\ntesting for the market efficiency and performance of emerging markets particularly in cases\nwhere there is a high market concentration (see, Buguk et al., 2003). Higgins (1988) suggests\nthat examination of the relationship between stock market indexes provides useful\ninformation in predicting future economic performance. Further there is evidence that the\nrejection of weak form market efficiency could be explained by the high correlation amongst\nthe dominant sector indexes (Arbel\u00e1ez et al., 2001). Amongst others, Ratner (1996) uses nine\nmajor equity indices in examining the market efficiency of the Madrid Stock Exchange and\nconfirms that index returns significantly depart from the random walk and their distribution\ndeviate from normality.\nPrevious research using index data in the Greek stock markets seem to confirm that the\nAthens Stock Exchange (ASE, henceforth) is informationally inefficient. For example,\nKavussanos and Dockery (2001) using multivariate generalizations and seemingly unrelated\n4regressions, confirm that the ASE is informationally inefficient, implying that past stock\nprices contain information for predicting future price movements. Siourounis (2002) employ\nGARCH type models and tests for their validity in the Athens Stock Exchange Market. He\nfinds that returns are correlated and current volatility is positively correlated with past\nvolatility confirming that the weak form of efficient market hypothesis does not hold in the\nASE. Niarchos and Alexakis (2003), test the market efficiency in the ASE by investigating for\nthe stock price patterns. They find that specific price patterns exist and that trading rules\nbased on these price patterns can be profitably exploited compared to a passive buy and hold\nstrategy. More recently, Panagiotidis (2005) rejects the random walk hypothesis for the three\ndifferent FTSE\/ASE indices after the introduction of Euro.\nAthens Stock Exchange has 18 sector indices, yet only six sectors namely, Banking,\nIndustrial, Construction, Insurance, Investment and Holding account for more than 63% of the\ntotal market capitalization. We believe that understanding the behaviour and interaction\namongst these six main indexes will significantly contribute in understanding the role of\nmajor sectors of the Greek economy in shaping the behaviour and efficiency of the Athens\nStock Exchange. Furthermore, an investigation of the short and long run relationships\namongst the major sectoral indexes will be highly useful to individual and institutional\ninvestors who are keen on diversifying their portfolios by investing in the emerging Greek\nstock market.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the short term and long\nterm relationships amongst the major stock indexes of the Athens Stock Exchange. To the\nbest our knowledge this is the first study that examines the short and long run interactions\n5among stock indexes in the ASE. The findings of this research will help in answering a\nnumber of interesting issues such as: do these indexes behave in similar ways? Do they\ninfluence each other in the short and the long run? What is the direction of causality and is\nthis causality consistent over time?\nOur findings suggest that even though the sector indexes do not show a consistent and strong\nlong-term relationship, the banking sector seems to have a strong influence on the returns and\nvolatility of other sectors at least in the short-run. The variance decomposition analysis\nconfirms that although the variance of returns for most sectors is largely influenced by their\nown innovations, banking sector is able to explain 25% of variance of construction and the\ninsurance sectors and around 15% of the variance of industrial, investment and holding\nsectors. The leading role of the banking sector implies that changes in the banking sector\nindex could be potentially used in predicting short term movements in other sector indexes\nconfirming that the ASE is not weak form efficient.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section describes the data and the\nmethodology. Section 3 reports the results of empirical tests and the last section concludes.\n2. Data and Methodology\nThere are 18 sector indexes in the Athens Stock Exchange. For a sector index to be created, it\nmust include at least five companies unless the total average market capitalisation of the\nsector is at least equal to 3% of the market value of the ASE in which case a sector index may\ncontain only 3 listed companies. The number of shares making up a sector index must\ncorrespond to at least 65% of the sector's capitalization. The data used in this study consists of\ndaily stock prices of the Banking, Industrial, Construction, Insurance, Investment and Holding\n6sector indexes. As already mentioned, only a few sectors dominate the market capitalization\nand trading in the ASE. For instance, at the end of 2003, Banking, Industrial and Construction\nsectors together accounted for nearly 54% of the total market capitalization in the ASE. The\nremaining 15 sectors shared the balance 46% market capitalization. For this reason, we have\nselected the six main indexes representing the Banking, Industrial, Construction, Insurance,\nInvestment and Holding sectors. Table 1 shows the weights of each sector in the ASE General\nIndex, their market capitalization, trading volumes and the number of listed companies for\neach selected sector. The statistics show that the banking sector leads all other sectors with the\nhighest percentage (27.51%) of the total market capitalization worth \u20ac18.467 million and\ntrading volume of \u20ac5.722 million. The Banking sector is followed by the Industrial, Holding,\nConstruction, Investment and the Insurance sectors respectively in terms of market\ncapitalization and trading volume. The total weight of these five sectors in the ASE General\nIndex is 63.2% confirming the highly concentrated nature of the ASE.\nDaily data for the period from 01\/01\/96 to 31\/12\/03 comprising 2,088 trading days has been\ncollected. We choose 1996 as the start of our sample period because daily data on the selected\nsectors is available only from this date. Data series used in this study were obtained from the\nASE database. In all cases we have used the logarithmic transformation of the price series in\ncalculating daily returns.\nFigure 1 provides a time series plot of the daily return series. A visual inspection of Figure 1\nshows an upward trend during 1996-1999 and a downward trend during 2000-2003. Thus\nthere appears to be a clear structural break in the time series which may have been caused by\nthe regulatory changes introduced by the Greek government at the beginning of 2000. The\n7regulatory changes aimed to rationalize and modernise the ASE by introducing changes in the\nlisting requirements, measures for improving the transparency of the market, and new laws for\ndealing with the modernisation of stock transactions.1 We split the total sample into two equal\nsub-periods to account for this structural break which also reflects the change in the market\nconditions in the ASE. The first sub-period 1996-1999 represents bull market and the second\nsub-period 2000-2003 reflects the bear market conditions in the Athens Stock Exchange.2\nThe analytical process comprises four steps. The first step involves determining the order of\nintegration. For this purpose, the unit root testing procedure suggested by Zivot and Andrews\n(1992) is used because as already seen in figure 1; the time series exhibits a clear structural\nbreak.3\nThe second step involves examining the long run relationships using the VAR analysis\nproposed by Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990). We follow Johansen-Juselius\n(JJ) because their approach is considered superior to the regression-based approach suggested\nby Engle and Granger in 1987 (Cheung and Lai, 1993).4 Another reason for using the JJ\napproach is that it utilizes the maximum likelihood estimates and allows testing and\nestimation of more than one cointegrating vector in the multivariate system without requiring\na specific variable to be normalised. This way, the JJ tests overcome the problem of carrying\nover the errors from the first step into the second step commonly encountered in Engle and\n1See Law No 2843 in Government Gazette on 21.1.2000\n2 This is consistent with Pricing (1991) who suggests that the stock price formation is different in bull and bear\nmarket conditions.\n3 Perron (1988) showed that the augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron test statistics are biased toward the\nrejection of a unit root test if there is any evidence of structural break(s) in the series.\n4 The Johansen-Juselius procedure resolves the problem of endogeneity in that we do not need to normalise the\ncointegrating vector on one of the variables as required in the Engle and Granger (EG) test.\n8Granger\u2019s (1987) approach to cointegration. Further, JJ method is independent of the choice\nof the endogenous variable within a vector autoregression (VAR) framework which enables\ntesting for various structural hypotheses involving restricted versions of cointegrating vectors\nand speed of adjustment parameters using likelihood ratio tests.\nThe analysis begins by specifying the vector autoregression model.

Since our objective is to investigate the long-run\n9relationship, we will focus on the elements of matrix \uf050. If vector Y contains m variables,\nmatrix \uf050 will be of order m x m, with a maximum possible rank of m (or full rank). Equation\n(3), except for the \uf050Yt-k term, is in the form of the traditional VAR with first difference. The\n\uf050 term determines whether the system of equations is cointegrated, i.e., whether a long-run\nequilibrium relationship exists. The feature to note is that the rank of matrix \uf050 is equal to the\nnumber of independent cointegrating vectors. If rank of matrix \uf050 = 0, the matrix is null, i.e.,\nall the elements in this matrix are zero, which implies no cointegration or in other words lack\nof a long-run equilibrium relationship and the error correction mechanism, \uf050Yt-k, therefore,\ndoes not exist. In determining the rank of matrix \uf050 (number of cointegrating vectors), we\ncalculate the characteristic roots or eigenvalues, i\uf06c\u02c6 of \uf050. Johansen (1988) and Johansen and\nJuselius (1990) propose trace (\uf06ctrace) and maximum eigenvalue (\uf06cmax) test statistics to establish\nwhether the characteristics roots are significantly different from zero. The computed values of\n\uf06ctrace and \uf06cmax statistics are evaluated using the critical values provided by Osterwarld-Lenum\n(1992) and the optimal system lag length is determined by using the Schwarz Bayesian\nCriterion (SBC).\nIf there is no cointegration or long-term relationship between the indexes then the short-term\nrelationship is examined using the Granger causality between the endogenous variables in the\nfollowing way:\nRy,t = a + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\nn\ni 1\n\u03b2i Ry,t-i + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\nn\ni 1\n\u03b3i Rx,t-i + \u03b5 t (4)\nRx,t = a + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\nn\ni 1\n\u03b4i R x,t-i + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\nn\ni 1\n\u03b6i Ry,t-\u03b9 + u t (5)\nwhere Ry,t and Rx,t are the returns of index y and x at time t accordingly.\n10\nIn the above regressions we examine whether the coefficients \u03b3i and \u03b6i are equal to zero using\na standard F test. If \u03b3i, and \u03b6i coefficients are different from zero then we conclude that there is\na bi-directional causality between and Ry,t and Rx,t. Alternatively, if both coefficients are\nfound to be equal to zero, then we are able to conclude that there is no causality. Finally, in\nequation (4) Ry,t Granger causes Rx,t if \u03b3i =0 for i=1,2,\u2026n. Similarly, in (5) causality implies\nthat Rx,t Granger causes Ry,t , provided that \u03b6i \uf0b9 0 for i=1,2,\u2026n.5\nThe short run dynamics are examined by using the variance decomposition analysis. The\nvariance decomposition traces the relative importance of each random innovation in affecting\nthe variables in the system. Specifically, the forecast-errors provide information about the\nproportion of the movements caused by own shocks vis a vis shocks in other variables. Since\nthe ordering of variables in the VAR model has a significant impact in variance\ndecomposition results, we follow the order invariant generalised variance decomposition\nanalysis (see, Pesaran and Shin, 1998). Also in contrast to the traditional impulse response\nanalysis (Koop, 1996), the generalised approach does not require orthogonalisation of shocks.\nThe generalised variance decomposition is widely used in studying long and short run\nlinkages across sector indexes (see for example, Wang, Kutan, and Yang, 2005).\n3. Empirical Findings\nTable 2 presents the descriptive statistics of returns for all six sectors. Panel A reports\nstatistics for the whole sample period whilst panel B and C contain statistics for the two sub-\nperiods, 1996-1999 and 2000-2003. In panel A, the Industrial sector offers highest average\n5 One problem related with the Granger causality test is that results are sensitive with respect to the selected of\nlag length. We use the Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SBC) in determining the appropriate lag length because it is\nconsidered theoretically superior to the Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC) and penalizes for inclusion of\nhigher number of lags in the regression.\n11\nreturns and lowest standard deviation. The next best performing sector is the Banking sector\nwith an average daily return of 0.068. The Construction sector seems to be the most volatile\namongst all six sectors with the highest standard deviation of 0.027. Skewness and kurtosis\nmeasures show that return distributions of all six sectors are positively skewed and highly\nleptokurtic. A similar pattern of return distribution is found for first sub-period in Panel B.\nHowever, for second sub-period (Panel C), the returns are negatively skewed for the Industrial\nsector. Kurtosis is higher than normal for returns in the whole period as well as the two sub-\nperiods for all six sectors suggesting that return distributions deviate from the normal\ndistribution. Next we examine the autocorrelations of returns for lags one to five. We have\nchosen to examine autocorrelations up to five lags because we use daily data and wanted to\nlook as far back as a week. From results (not reported here but available on request) we are\nable to note that for the period 1996-2003, the first order autocorrelations are statistically\nsignificant in all cases. Furthermore, the Box-Pierce Q-statistics suggest that all time series\nexhibit significant positive autocorrelation at lag one. Autocorrelations for the two sub-\nperiods do not show any significant difference relative to those obtained for the full period.\nTherefore for both sub-periods the null hypothesis of no serial dependence is rejected at 5%\nlevel of significance. We use Zivot and Andrews unit root test (ZA) to determine the order of\nintegration for each series. The ZA test results (not reported here but available on request)\nshow that the null hypothesis of unit root cannot be rejected for any of the indexes in the level\nform. However, we are able to reject the null hypothesis for the first differenced series for all\nsix sectors at the 1% level of significance confirming that all six sectors indexes are integrated\nto the order one, I (1). Results of Johansen\u2019s cointegration tests for the full sample and two\nsub-periods are given in Table 3. Column 1 shows fifteen different models employed in\nexamining the long-run relationships and columns 2 and 3 provide the Trace and Maximum\n12\nEigenvalue statistics. For the full sample, the results conclusively indicate that the returns of\nthe Banking and the Construction index are cointegrated.6 Notably, the indexes appear to\nshow greater cointegration in the second sub-period (1996-2003) where the null hypothesis of\nno cointegration can be rejected in more number of cases. Specifically, Banking-Investment,\nIndustrial-Insurance, Industrial-Investment, Construction-Investment, Investment-Holding are\ncointegrated at the 5% level of significance. The results are consistent with those reported by\nWang et al. (2005) for the Chinese stock markets where they find that various sectors are\nhighly integrated and sector prices reflect information from other sectors. The results are also\nconsistent with studies which show that long-run relationships among national equity markets\nhave become stronger over time (see for example, Al-Khazali et al. 2006, Nikkinen, et al.\n2006). Overall though, with the exception of Banking and the Construction sectors, the\nstatistical evidence for the long-term equilibrium relationship is neither consistent nor\nstatistically very strong to suggest that there is a long-term relationship among the ASE\nsectoral indexes.\nSince most sectors do not show consistent and strong evidence of a long-run relationship, we\nexamine whether they are related at least in the short-run by using the Granger\u2019s causality\ntests. The results in Table 4 for the full as well as the two sub-periods show that there is\nunidirectional causality running from Banking to Construction, Insurance, Investment and\nHolding sectors. This clearly indicates that the banking sector appears to be the most\ndominant and influential sector in the Greek economy in spite of some evidence of bi-\n6 Given that the Banking and Constructions indexes are cointegrated, we use an Error-correction Model (ECM).\nThe results of the ECM (not reported here but available on request) show that for the whole sample as well as the\ntwo sub-periods, lagged as well as unlagged innovations in returns from banking index could be potentially used\nin forecasting returns from the Construction index thus confirming the leading role of the banking sector in the\nASE.\n13\ndirectional causality between Construction and Investment sectors and unidirectional causality\nbetween Holding and the Investment sectors. Overall though, the F-statistics are significant\nfor only 11 out of 30 combinations which suggest that there is no consistent evidence of bi-\ndirectional causality or short-run relationship amongst the sector indexes.\nFurther analysis of the index returns using the variance decomposition analysis for periods\nranging from one, one to five, one to ten, and one to fifteen days presented in Table 5 suggests\nthat for most sector indexes, the forecast variance seems to be most influenced by the\ninnovations in the past variance. The variance decomposition analysis results for the whole\nsample period (denoted I) as well as the two sub-periods (II and III respectively) further\nconfirm this finding. Specifically, on the first day (short run), for period I, the banking index\nexplains 100% of its forecast error variance by innovations in its own variance. After fifteen\ndays (long run) 99.5 % of the variation is explained by own innovations while changes in\nIndustrial, Construction, Insurance, Investment, and Holding sectors only explain 0.9%, 1.1%,\n0.8%, 0.2%, 0.6% of the variance in the banking sector respectively. However, the variance\ndecomposition analysis results for other sectors, though largely similar to the banking sector,\nsuggest that innovations in the variance of returns in the banking sector is able to explain, on\naverage, 25% innovations in the variance of Construction and the Insurance sector. The\nvariance innovations in banking sector returns also seem to influence variance of Industrial,\nInvestment and the Holding sector returns. This is consistent with the evidence of short-term\nunidirectional causality flowing from the banking sector to the other sectors reported in Table\n4.\nThe leading role of the banking sector in the ASE could be explained by its significance in the\nGreek economic system. The Greek banking sector index includes National Bank of Greece,\n14\nAlpha Bank, EFG Eurobank Ergasias, Commercial Bank of Greece, and Piraeus Bank. These\nfive banks are dominant players in the Athens stock exchange with a combined market\ncapitalization value of \u20ac18.467m and 27.51% share of the total market capitalization of the\nASE in 2003. According to the Athens Stock Exchange official reports, the banking sector\nrepresents 11% of the total number of companies listed in the ASE and more than 55% of the\ntotal annual transactions. Further, banks represent about 50% of the twenty five most active\nstocks in the ASE (see Athens Stock Exchange yearbook 2003). Thus, higher market\ncapitalisation and greater liquidity of the banking sector stocks is reflected in the leading\ninfluence of the banking sector reported in our analysis in the previous sections.\n4. Conclusions\nThis paper investigates short and long term relationships amongst the six main indexes of the\nAthens Stock Exchange with an aim to examine whether the ASE is informationally efficient.\nThe paper analyses daily returns of the Banking, Industrial, Construction, Insurance,\nInvestment and Holding sector indexes over a period of seven years (1996-2003) as well as\nfor the two sub-periods 1996-1999 (representing bull period) and 2000-2003 (representing a\nbear period). The findings suggest that even though the major sectors do not show a\nconsistent and strong long-term relationship, the banking sector seems to have a strong\ninfluence on the returns and volatility of other sectors at least in the short-run. The variance\ndecomposition analysis confirms that although the variance of returns for most sectors is\nlargely influenced by their own return innovations, banking sector is able to explain 25% of\nvariance of construction and the insurance sectors and around 15% of the variance of\nindustrial, investment, and holding sectors. The leading role of the banking sector implies that\nchanges in the banking sector index could be potentially used in predicting short term\nmovements in other indexes confirming that the ASE is not weak form efficient.\n15\nReferences\nAl-Khazali, O., Darrat, A., Saad, M.
