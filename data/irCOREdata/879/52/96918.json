Introduction\nThis is the third in a sequence of papers generalizing enzyme-substrate analyses\n(Burke et al., 1990; Maini et al., 1991). The system we are most interested in is the\n'suicide substrate' system, represented by\n*1 *J *3\nE + S^X-Y-E+P,\nwhere E, S, and P denote enzyme, substrate, and product, respectively; X and Y,\nenzyme-substrate intermediates; Ej, inactivated enzyme; and the k's, the positive rate\nconstants. In this system, the enzyme reacts with the suicide substrate S to form\nintermediate Y, which can either convert to product and regenerate the unchanged\nenzyme or become irreversibly inactivated enzyme. In this way, a suicide substrate\ncan specifically target an enzyme for inactivation. Furthermore, suicide substrates\nt Present address: Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Division of Basic Research, Biomedical Science Tower,\nDeSoto at O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.\n97\n1 Oxford Uruvemly Preu 1993\n98 MEGHAN A. BURKE ET AL.\nare not harmful in their common form. Hence, they are very useful as drugs (Seiler\net al, 1978; Walsh et al, 1984).\nUsing the law of mass action on the suicide substrate reaction, along with\nconservation of enzyme, we obtain a system of four rate equations:\n[S], = -M\u00a3o-[X] - [Y] -\n[X], = fc,(\u00a30 - [X] - [Y] - [E,])[S] - ( * _ , + fc2)[X],\n], = *4[Y],\nwhere [ ] denotes concentration. In a previous paper (Burke et al, 1990), we applied\na new small parameter e to the above space-independent problem. The new e was\ndefined by Segel & Slemrod (1989) as\ne=\n E\n\u00b0 , (1)\nSo + ^M\nwhere Eo and So are the initial concentrations of free enzyme and substrate,\nrespectively, and KM = (k_1 + k2)\/kl is the Michaelis constant. This e was introduced\nas a more general small parameter than eh = Eo\/So, which was previously used by\nseveral authors (see e.g. Heineken et al, 1967, and the books by Murray, 1977, and\nKeener, 1988). By utilizing this new parameter, which is small when KM is large, even\nif Eo and So are of the same order of magnitude, it is possible to solve the system in two\ntime regimes: when t\/e is 0(1) and when t is 0(1), that is, before and during the\nquasi-steady-state phase, when the enzyme is saturated with substrate and the\nquasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) is valid. In this way, one can obtain a solution\nuniformly valid for all time.\nIn a second paper (Maini et al, 1991), we discussed the spatially varying problem\nby introducing injection and diffusion of the substrate. There, we find that the region\nwhere the QSSA holds is no longer a small region close to t = 0, but varies from a\nsmall ring about the origin to a disc in space which expands in time, depending on\nthe enzyme reaction. However, we do find the consistency that when\nis small, where E and S are some typical values of enzyme and substrate, the QSSA\nis valid. This emphasizes the significance of the new e, as it introduced KM, the only\nquantity which is constant in space and time.\nIn this paper, we examine more closely the case where the QSSA holds in the\nsuicide substrate reaction, and attempt to solve the resulting system with both an\ninstantaneous point source, representing a single injection of substrate, and a\ncontinuous point source, representing a continuous flow of substrate into the system.\n2. Reaction-diffusion system\nIn enzyme reactions, the molecular weight of the enzyme is normally much larger\nthan that of the substrate; in some cases it may be orders of magnitude larger.\nSUICIDE SUBSTRATE REACTION-DIFFUSION EQUATIONS 99\nFurthermore, there are many instances where the enzyme is, in fact, physically bound\nto a membrane while the substrate diffuses freely. For these reasons, it is reasonable\nto model the spatial dependence in an enzyme-substrate reaction by diffusion of the\nsubstrate while the enzyme is held fixed.\nIt is notable that, in assuming E is fixed, we can assume that any complex involving\nE (X, Y, and E,) is also fixed. As a first step towards modelling spatial dependence,\nwe assume that the medium is homogeneous; we ignore effects due to blood cells,\ncell membrane, or blood vessel barriers, and consider the diffusion to be modelled\nby Fick's law with constant diffusion coefficient.\nThe scenario we would like to examine is as follows. Initially, an amount of\nsubstrate is injected into the medium at the origin. The substrate diffuses into the\nmedium and reacts with the enzyme. In looking at the suicide substrate reaction, we\nwish to analyse the parameters that affect the size of the region and the degree to\nwhich the enzyme is inactivated.\nTherefore, in our simple case, we use a Dirac delta-function as the initial condition\nfor [S], with So as its coefficient. This implies that the total amount of substrate\nis So at the origin and zero elsewhere at the beginning of the reaction (time = 0).\nThe free enzyme, on the other hand, is present in uniform concentration, \u00a30,\nthroughout the medium. At the beginning of the reaction, there are no enzyme-\nsubstrate complexes.\nThe full three-dimensional version of the model is not amenable to analysis and\ncan only be solved numerically. To gain insight into the behaviour of the system with\ndiffusion, we therefore restrict ourselves to the special case of radial symmetry\u2014this\nenables us to carry out a reasonably complete analysis and to understand the effects\nof diffusion. We represent the spatial dimension by r, distance from the origin, and\nuse V2 to indicate the spatial Laplacian in n dimensions. For illustrative purposes,\nwe use n = 1. The constant coefficient of diffusion is D.\nTo investigate the effects of diffusion we consider a large domain, so that boundary\nconditions play only a minimal role in the initial stages of the reaction. Since the\nproblem is symmetric about r = 0 for n > 1, we have a no-flux condition at the\norigin. We also use a no-flux condition at the periphery, r = L, so that substrate\ndoes not leak out from the boundary. To ensure that this holds for n = 1, we impose\nno-flux conditions at r = 0 in this case also. With these conditions, we have, for the\nspatially dependent suicide substrate reaction,\n[S], = - \/ c ^ o - [X] - [Y] - [E,])[S] + k.,[X] + DV2[S], (2)\n[X], = MEo - [X] - [Y] - [E,])[S] - ( * _ , + k2)[X], (3)\n[Y], = *2[X]-(*3 + *4)[Y], (4)\n[E,], = *4[Y], (5)\nwith initial conditions\n[S](0, r) = S08(r), (6)\n[X](0, r) = [Y](0, r) = [E,](0, r) = 0, (7)\n100 MEGHAN A. BURKE ET AL.\nand boundary conditions\n[S]r(r, 0) = [S],(t, L) = 0, (8)\n[X]P(t, 0) = [X],(r, L) = 0, (9)\n[Y]r(r, 0) = [Y],(t, L) = 0, (10)\n[Ei]r(t,O)=[Ei]r(t, ^) = 0, (11)\nwhere we have used a Dirac delta-function initial condition to simulate a fixed\namount So of substrate injected initially at r = 0. For all subsequent numerical\nsimulations, we approximate the delta-function by a tent function.\n3. The quasi-steady-state assumption\nWhen D = 0, it was found previously (Burke et al., 1990) that the quasi-steady-state\nassumption is valid if\ne =\n+\nis small. Keeping this in mind for the D # 0 situation, intuitively we may say that\nwhere some related (but now variable) quantity\n( )\n ^\nis small, the quasi-steady-state assumption holds. We introduce this new notation of\n\u00a3 as a function of r and t to emphasize that it is no longer constant. Specifically, S\nis not constant. In fact, although we use [S](0, r) = S08(r) as an initial condition, So\nis not a good characteristic value of S. We think of S intuitively as the typical amount\nof substrate that one observes at a fixed point in space. Although the delta-function\ninitial condition implies that a space point near r = 0 has zero initial concentration\nof substrate, very quickly a large amount of substrate diffuses towards that point. In\ncontrast, a point far from r \u2014 0 also has zero initial concentration of substrate, but\nsubstrate only slowly enters its neighbourhood in very small amounts. Intuitively,\nwe would like to say that these two points have different S, but as yet we cannot\nquantify this.\nMoreover, neither is E constant. Again observing from a fixed space point, we\nbegin with [E] = Eo. The concentration of enzyme then decreases as it reacts with\nsubstrate which has diffused into the area. Enzyme may not increase again signifi-\ncantly as substrate diffuses out of the area, because some of the enzyme does not\nreturn to its original form, but is left inactivated. So \u00a3 also varies in time and space\nin some as yet unqualified way.\nQearly, adding diffusion has greatly increased the complexity of the problem, so\nwe must choose special cases in which we can carry out an analysis. In the next\nsection, we examine the effects of using the QSSA in the case where KM \u00bb \u00a30, So.\nWe will see that the QSSA is largely valid in this case, because e(r, t) is small for\nmost of the domain.\nSUICIDE SUBSTRATE REACTION-DIFFUSION EQUATIONS 101\n4. Instantaneous point source analysis\nWhen KM is large compared with Eo and S& then the quasi-steady-state approxi-\nmation holds for all time and space domains, because KM is independent of time and\nspace, and \u00a30 and So are the maximum values of E and S, respectively. Thus, e(r, t)\nis bounded above by E0\/KM, and is always small. To test this hypothesis, we compare\nnumerical solutions of the full system with the solutions of the quasi-steady-state\nsystem.\nFor this and all other simulations of parabolic systems of partial differential\nequations, we used NAG routine D03PGF. When only one parabolic PDE was\nsolved, NAG routine D03PAF was used.\nUsing the quasi-steady-state assumption on (2)-(5), we set the time derivatives of\n[X] and [Y] in (3) and (4) equal to zero. Solving (4) for [Y] and substituting into\n(3), we have\n[ X ] HKfi.-\n[S](\u00a3o - [E,])\nBy adding equation (2) to equation (3) with the left-hand side equated to zero we\nobtain a simple equation for [S], in terms of [X]:\n[S] f =-* 2 [X] + \/)V2[S]. (14)\nSubstituting (13) into (14) and (5), we obtain a system of two equations for [S]\nand [E,],\n= _ -fc a[S](\u00a3,-[E,])\n{1+*\/ (* + *)}[S] + K\nr E -\u2022 _ M * [S](\u00a3o - [E,])\ni J\n' *3 + kA {1 + k2\/(k3 + *4)}[S] + KM'\nas the quasi-steady-state equations.\nFigure 1 compares the [S] and [E;] solution surfaces of the full system (2)-(5)\nwith the solution surfaces of the quasi-steady-state approximation (15)\u2014(16). We call\nthis the 'difference surface': it is determined by taking the magnitude of the difference\nof the two concentration values at each point, and dividing by their average. Thus,\nwhere the difference surface is zero, the quasi-steady-state assumption is valid. This\npicture shows that KM large ensures validity of the QSSA almost everywhere, except\nnear the very beginning of the reaction. We therefore take (15) to be a valid\napproximation for [S] of the full system. To solve this equation we must examine\nthe magnitude of the various terms.\nLarge KM implies that k_i+k2\u00bbk1. In practice, it is often true that the\nenzyme-binding step (the uptake of substrate) is the rate-limiting step, which implies\nthat fc_i \u00bbfct.

With these\nparameter values, Ku = 40. Note that away from zero for large t there is a large percentage difference.\nThis is because [S] is very small here, so that the denominator in the difference surface calculation tends\nto zero.\nIn (15) and (16), we notice that both denominators contain the term\nl + - ^ - i r S l + Ku.

That this is a good\napproximation to the quasi-steady-state equations (15)\u2014(16) can be seen by solving\nboth sets of equations numerically and calculating the difference surface (shown\nin Fig. 2).\nSUICIDE SUBSTRATE REACTION-DIFFUSION EQUATIONS 103\n250\n250\nFIG. 2.

(20}\nThe variable A is the concentration of'active' enzyme (that is, either free or in complex\nas X or Y) and is easier to determine experimentally than the amount of inactive\nenzyme.

This reduces (28) to\n^ (31)\nthe solution to which can be found, for example, by Fourier transforms for the\nSUICIDE SUBSTRATE REACTION-DIFFUSION EQUATIONS 105\none-dimensional case. Thus\n2N\/Df\/\n^ ) ] } , (32,\nwhere K = (Eok2)\/KM.\nWe now obtain [S] by differentiating W with respect to time:\n[S] = -%= cxJ-Kt-^-). (33)\nThis is, in fact, precisely the result obtained in the Michaelis-Menten case (see Maini\net al., 1991). So, when (30) is a valid approximation of (29), that is, when KM is large\ncompared with W, the mechanism of the suicide substrate reaction has little effect on\nthe dynamics of [S].\nThis approximation is not simply a degeneration to a previous case. The analytical\nsolution for W in (32) can now be used to give an analytical solution for A from\n(26). We thus have\nA = E\nThis analytical solution is only valid where (29) can be approximated by (30), that\nis, where KM is large compared with W. Note that KM is a straightforward\ncombination of rate constants, but W is more difficult to quantify intuitively. For\na given t and r, W is the 'history' of [S] from the initial time point to time = t at\nspace point r. Thus several parameters have an effect on W. For example, when D is\nlarge, S diffuses quickly, and at a given space point, W will be smaller than it would\nbe if large amounts of S remained in the area (small D). Figure 3 shows the validity\nof the approximation for various values of KM and D for [S] and [E,] . Notice that the\napproximation for [S] becomes worse than the approximation for [E,] , and that KM\nappears to have a more pronounced effect than D, but that with increasing time (and\nhence increasing W) the approximation breaks down. Thus care is required when\nusing (33) and (34), as the parameter space where they are valid is tight. However,\nthese analytical solutions, expecially (34) for [EJ , can be informative in the parameter\nspaces where they are valid.\n5.

If KM is large, this presaturation\ntime period should be very short, and the QSSA will be a good approximation\nthroughout the space-time domain. This implies that we can use (15) and (16) with\nthe initial and boundary conditions describing a continuous source, namely (35)\nand (36). Figure 4 shows the difference surfaces for [S] and [E;] of the full system\n(2)-(5) and of the QSS system (15)\u2014(16) with large KM and continuous source\nboundary conditions. With [EJ the difference is small everywhere except near the\norigin at very small time, while with [S] the difference is small (less than 10%)\neverywhere. It is clear from these figures that we are justified in using the QSSA\nwhen KM is large.\nThe solution for a problem with a continuous source may be obtained from the\ncorresponding instantaneous source solution by integrating with respect to time (see\ne.g. Crank, 1975: p. 31). We apply this technique to the appropriate approximate\nsolutions obtained earlier. There we found equation (33) as an approximate solution\nto the QSS system when KM is large and So is the coefficient of the delta-function\npoint source.

As the boundary conditions and initial conditions for\n[EJ are the same whether we have an instantaneous source or a continuous source,\nwe can still use the expression obtained for [EJ from (26):\n[E,](r, t) = E0- Eo exp( - *2*4 P [S](r, T) d A (39)\nV (fc3 + kJKM Jo \/\nThe expression for [S] in (38) cannot be integrated in closed form, but can be\nnumerically integrated to give a solution for [EJ.\nWe now determine the regions in parameter space wherein the expressions (38)\nand (39) found in the previous section via the QSSA are in close agreement with the\nsolutions obtained by numerical simulation of the full system (2)-(5).\nFigure 5(a, b) shows the approximations (38) and (39) for [S] and [EJ compared\nwith the full system. In this figure, large KM was used (KM = 4.0) with small Q\n(Q = 0.04) so that the accumulation of S, which is denned as W, remains small, making\n(30) a valid approximation of (29). One can see that the approximate solutions are\nin very close agreement with the full system. Figure 5(c, d) shows the same solutions,\nbut with different parameters. Here Q is larger (Q = 0.4), while KM is kept at 4.0.\nThese parameters are outside the domain specified when we obtained (38) and (39),\nso we expect to lose some accuracy. If we violate the restrictions further, and use\nsmaller KM (KM = 0.8), we can see (Fig. 5(e, f)) that the accuracy of our approxima-\ntions deteriorates further. However, we now know that our approximations are valid\nin the specified parameter space, namely KM large and Q small.\n6. Discussion\nWe have generalized the quasi-steady-state assumption to apply to the case where\nthe diffusion coefficient D \/ 0 for two different boundary conditions. We have shown\nhow the careful choice of a general small parameter e enables us to analyse certain\ntypes of reaction which could not be analysed using the classical small parameter.\nSpecifically, we obtained solutions for an enzyme-suicide substrate reaction with an\ninstantaneous point source of substrate.\nWe then used these analytical solutions to the instantaneous point source problem\nto obtain solutions to the continuous point source problem, with boundary con-\nditions (35) and (36). For both sets of boundary conditions we have determined the\nregions in parameter space where our analytical solutions are valid.\nNow that we have an idea of the suicide substrate reaction dynamics with a\ncontinuous source, a natural extension of this work is to examine the system with a\nswitch-function source. That is, we would like to turn the source on and off, and\nSUICIDE SUBSTRATE REACTION-DIFFUSION EQUATIONS 111\n60'\n250\n250\n250\nFIG. 5.
