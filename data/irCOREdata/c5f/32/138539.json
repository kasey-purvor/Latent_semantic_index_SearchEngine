A number of 3 \nstudies have focused on chronic hydrocarbon contamination near the Antarctic and sub-4 \nAntarctic research stations, revealing the presence and persistence of these human-derived 5 \ncontaminants (Cripps and Shears, 1997; Snape et al., 2001; Delille and Pelletier, 2002; 6 \nAislabie et al., 2004; Rayner et al., 2007). Of all the different types of contamination reported 7 \nup to now in Antarctica, petroleum has been identified as the most significant problem to be 8 \naddressed (Snape et al., 2001). The need for research into hydrocarbon degradation process at 9 \nlow temperatures is therefore without question in order to preserve the vulnerable and extreme 10 \nAntarctic environments. Many physical, chemical and biological technologies have been 11 \ndeveloped to remove hydrocarbon pollutants from soils and restore the environmental 12 \nintegrity. However, these techniques are often unfeasible in remote areas where accessibility 13 \nof heavy equipment and materials is limited or prohibited by the high sensitivity of threatened 14 \nenvironments. Bioremediation, including biostimulation and bioaugmentation, has proven to 15 \nbe an effective method for cleaning up residual oil in a variety of environments (Van Hamme 16 \net al., 2003) and has been proposed as the only viable management option that can be 17 \nimplemented on a large scale in Antarctic environments (Snape et al., 2001). In many 18 \ninstances, however, the rate of petroleum biodegradation in cold environments is severely 19 \nlimited by temperature fluctuation and the available concentrations of fixed forms of nitrogen 20 \nand phosphate (Walworth and Reynolds 1995; Coulon et al., 2004; Delille et al., 2007). Low 21 \ntemperature plays a significant role in controlling the nature and extent of microbial 22 \nhydrocarbon metabolism (Gerdes et al., 2005, Nedwell, 1999) and directly affects both the rate 23 \nof biodegradation and the physicochemical behaviour of oil hydrocarbons, such as viscosity, 24 \ndiffusion and volatilization (Enell et al., 2005; Maliszewska-Kordybach, 2005). Additionally, 25 \n 4 \nnutrient supplementation (so-called biostimulation) of polluted sites has been shown to be an 1 \neffective means of stimulating hydrocarbon biodegradation activities of indigenous microbial 2 \npopulations and thereby of reducing the ecological impact of oil pollution (Delille et al., 2004; 3 \nAislabie et al, 2006). However, monitoring studies conducted in oil-contaminated polar soils 4 \nand experimental research during the last decades have documented the complexity of cold 5 \necology and the parameters that affect the severity of impacts to these systems (see for review 6 \nAislabie et al., 2006). This knowledge complicates decisions regarding cleanup in cold 7 \nenvironments, because parameters such as substrate type, oil type, season of impact and 8 \nclimate may all affect the eventual recovery of oil-contaminated polar soils. Limiting factors 9 \nneed to be overcome if microbial breakdown of contaminants is to be used effectively 10 \n(Alexander 1999, Margesin et al., 2007). However, the conditions when cleanup is desirable in 11 \na polar soil are not clearly delineated yet, and several important questions remain unresolved. 12 \nAmong them two of the more decisive are: which methods should be employed and at what 13 \npoint intervention is no longer useful? The aim of the present mesocosm study is to evaluate 14 \nand compare the benefits of temperature increase and slow release fertilizer addition on 15 \nbiodegradation of diesel fuel and crude oil in two different sub-Antarctic soils.  16 \n 17 \nMaterials and methods 18 \nField site, sampling and mesocosm set-up 19 \nTwo soils were collected from areas with no past exposure to hydrocarbon contamination. 20 \nBoth areas were located near the scientific research station \u201cPort aux Fran\u00e7ais\u201d in Kerguelen 21 \nArchipelago (49\u00b021\u2019S, 70\u00b013\u2019E). Soil samples were collected from the surface to a depth of 22 \nabout 0.2 m in approximately 20 m2 areas. The first selected soil was an organic soil 23 \nsupporting an abundant vegetal cover (Acaena magellanica), while the second one was a 24 \nmineral soil, completely dry and desert. The general physical, chemical and biological 25 \n 5 \nproperties of the two sub-Antarctic soils have been previously described (Coulon et al., 2004).  1 \nMesocosm experiments were conducted in polyethylene containers of dimensions 27 x 24 x 13 2 \ncm. Plant residues have been removed for the organic soil before use. Soils have been aerated 3 \nand homogenized before placing 5 kg (w\/w) of soil in each mesocosm. The artificially 4 \ncontaminated soils were prepared by direct application of either 100 ml Arabian light crude oil 5 \nor diesel fuel (initial contaminant concentration = 30 mg g-1 soil dry mass). The composition 6 \nof Arabian light crude oil and diesel fuel was 52 and 71% of saturated linear and cyclic 7 \nalkanes, 45 and 28% of aromatics (2 to 5 rings PAH) and 3 and 1% of polar compounds, 8 \nrespectively. The slow release fertilizer used was Inipol EAP 22\u00ae (CECA S.A., France, C: N: 9 \nP = 62:7.4:0.7), which is a stable microemulsion consisting of a urea core (the nitrogen 10 \nsource) surrounded by oleic acid carrier, lauryl-phosphate (surfactant and the source of 11 \nphosphorus), and butoxyethanol (as viscosity reducer). The initial concentration of the 12 \nnutrients obtained were 1.2 mg N and 0.1 mg P g-1 soil dry mass. For each temperature of 13 \nincubation (4\u00b0C, 10\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C), six conditions were used: control, Inipol (50 ml), crude oil 14 \n(100 ml), crude oil (100 ml) + Inipol (50 ml), diesel (100 ml), and diesel (100 ml) + Inipol (50 15 \nml). The mesocosms were incubated in the dark under aerobic conditions during 2 months 16 \nperiod. They were homogenized twice a month. Samples for chemistry analysis were collected 17 \nin the surface layer of the soil and were stored at \u2013 20\u00b0C until analysis. 18 \n 19 \nBacteriological counts 20 \nThe changes in bacterial community abundance, comprising total, heterotrophic and 21 \nhydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms were studied during a 42 days period after 22 \ncontaminant addition. Sampling dates were 7, 15, 30, and 42 days. Triplicate samples were 23 \naseptically collected in the surface layer of the soil (from surface to 2 cm under the surface). 24 \nTotal bacteria were determined by acridine orange direct count (AODC) on black nuclepore 25 \n 6 \nfilters (0.2 \u00b5m) using an Olympus BHA epifluorescence microscope according to the method 1 \nof Hobbie et al. (1977). A minimum of 500 fluorescing cells with a clear outline and definite 2 \ncell shape cells were counted under oil immersion (x 1000) in a minimum of 10 randomly 3 \nchosen fields. The standard deviation calculated from 3 replicates was found \u2264 15 %. 4 \nHeterotrophic microorganisms in each soil sample was made using the spread plate technique 5 \non Nutrient Agar 2216 (Oppenheimer and ZoBell 1982), using distilled water in place of 6 \nseawater. Inoculated plates (six replicates) were incubated for 10 days at 15\u00b0C. Hydrocarbon-7 \ndegrading microorganisms were determined by the most probable number (MPN) method 8 \nusing tubes containing 9 ml of a basal mineral medium (NH4Cl: 2.0 g L\n-1, KH2PO4 : 0.89 g L\n-1, 9 \nNA2HPO4: 1.25 g l\n-1, FeCl3 : 0.6 mg l\n-1), supplemented with 0.2 ml of Arabian light crude oil 10 \nand 1 mg l-1  resazurin indicator (Mills et al., 1978). After inoculation (3 tubes per dilution), 11 \nthe tubes were incubated at 12\u00b0C for 30 days. The standard deviation calculated from 3 12 \nreplicates was found \u2264 20 % for both CFU and MPN estimations. 13 \n 14 \nHydrocarbon extraction and analysis 15 \nBefore extraction, soil samples were freeze-dried and homogenized by screening through a 1-16 \nmm sieve. Extraction procedure and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) 17 \nanalysis setting have been previously described (Coulon and Delille, 2006). Each dry soil 18 \nsample was extracted with a mix hexane:dichloromethane (1:1) overnight and the solution 19 \nwas evaporated under a mild stream of nitrogen on an ice bath to minimize losses of light 20 \nalkanes and PAH. Very light hydrocarbons such as benzene, pentane and hexane could be 21 \npartly lost during freeze drying. These light hydrocarbons are not accounted in total alkanes 22 \n(calculated from C10 to C36 linear alkanes and including iso-alkanes) and total aromatics 23 \n(from naphthalene to 4-ring aromatics including alkyl-substituted compounds). Analytes of 24 \nArabian light crude oil were normalized to the conservative biomarker 17\u03b1(H), 21\u03b2(H) C30-25 \n 7 \nhopane naturally present in crude oil (Butler et al., 1991) while analytes of diesel fuel were 1 \nnormalized to chrysene, considered to be one of aromatics most resistant to biodegradation 2 \n(Bossert and Bartha, 1986). Hopane was absent from diesel fuel samples. For quality control, 3 \na 1.0 ng \u00b5l-1 diesel standard solution (ASTM C12-C60 quantitative, Supelco) and a 1.0 ng \u00b5l-1 4 \nPAH Mix Standard solution (Supelco) were analyzed every 20 samples. The variation of the 5 \nreproducibility of the extraction and quantification protocol was determined by successive 6 \nextractions and injections of 8 replicates of the same field sample and estimated to be \u00b1 10%. 7 \n 8 \nStatistical analysis 9 \nMeasures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in Statview F-5.0 PPC (SAS Institute Inc.) was used 10 \nto analyze the response variables (CFU, MPN, fertilizer and oil analytes) in the two soils 11 \nseparately. When the ANOVA indicated significant differences (p <0.05), univariate 12 \nANOVAs were run on data at each time point. Where significant differences were indicated at 13 \na specific time point (p <0.05), protected least significant difference (LSD) mean separations 14 \nwere used to assess treatment differences 15 \n 16 \nResults 17 \nThere were only slight changes in total microbial abundance after contamination (data not 18 \nshown). With values comprised between 108 and 109 cells g -1, the total number of micro-19 \norganisms was roughly constant throughout all the mesocosm experiments. 20 \nThe basal level of heterotrophic microbes in the mesocosms, prior to oil addition, was 21 \nestimated to be 3.2 x 106 CFU g-1 in organic soil and 2.6 105 CFU g-1 in mineral soil. These 22 \nnumber remained relatively constant in most of the uncontaminated mesocosms. Following 23 \ndiesel fuel (Figure 1) or crude oil (Figure 2) addition, the number of heterotrophic microbes 24 \ndid not change significantly in both soils (P = 0.659 in organic soil and P = 0.317 in mineral 25 \n 8 \nsoil). Inipol amendment did not induce significant enhancement of the heterotrophic 1 \nassemblage in organic soil. In contrast significant increases of the number of saprophytic 2 \nbacteria occurred in all Inipol amended mesocosms of mineral soil (P < 0.001). Enhancements 3 \nreach three orders of magnitude and seems relatively independent from temperature.  4 \nBefore contamination, initial level of oil-degrading microbes estimated by the most probable 5 \nnumber (MPN) procedure was 2.7 x 105 MPN g-1 in organic soil and 3.0 x 105 MPN g-1 in 6 \nmineral soil (Figures 3 and 4). After crude oil amendment, the number of oil-degrading 7 \nmicrobes increased by one order of magnitude in both kind of soils (P < 0.082 in organic soil 8 \nand P < 0.056 in mineral soil) over a period of 7 days. In contrast, these numbers did not 9 \nincrease after diesel fuel amendment, except in organic mesocosms incubated at 4 and 20\u02daC. 10 \nAccording to the type of oil used, the comparison of the oil-degrading microbe\u2019s number for 11 \nthe same soil did not revealed significant difference between diesel fuel and crude oil (P > 12 \n0.05). The efficiency of the biostimulation treatments was much higher in the mineral soil 13 \n(more than three orders of magnitude) than in the organic one (less than two orders of 14 \nmagnitude) for both kinds of oil contaminants. At the end of the experiment, the numbers of 15 \noil-degrading microbes in diesel amended mineral soil microcosms can be four orders of 16 \nmagnitude higher than those determined in corresponding pristine soil whilst this difference is 17 \nless than two orders of magnitude in organic soil. Inipol amendment alone induced also a 18 \nsignificant increase in numbers of oil-degrading microbes in all mesocosms. This increase was 19 \nsignificantly greater in mineral soil mesocosms (P < 0.001) than in organic ones (P = 0.056). 20 \nTemperature elevation had a slight but positive effect on biostimulation of oil degrading 21 \nmicrobes. With the exeption of diesel contaminated organic soil, the maximum numbers were 22 \nalways observed in mesocosms incubated at 20\u02daC.  23 \nOverall, the total extractable petroleum hydrocarbons content (TPH) of both oil contaminants 24 \nhave reduced by more than 70% and 80% in organic soil mesocosms and more than 76% and 25 \n 9 \n96% in mineral soil mesocosms incubated at 4 and 20\u02daC, respectively. Detailed changes of oil 1 \nhydrocarbon fraction of both crude oil and diesel fuel are shown in Table 1. After fertiliser 2 \napplication, the differences in extent of degradation were most pronounced for both aliphatic 3 \n(P < 0.001) and aromatic (P = 0.098) fractions in mineral and organic soil mesocosms (Table 4 \n1; Fig 5). However, the benefit of adding nutrient was higher in mineral than in organic soil. 5 \nThe mass fraction of aromatics relative to aliphatic hydrocarbons has increased of more than 6 \n20% in crude oil amended mesocosms and more than 24% in diesel fuel amended ones, 7 \nregardless the soil type. These mass balance shifts were even higher in fertilised mineral soil 8 \nmesocosms: more than 35% in crude oil amended mesocosms (P < 0.001) and more than 42% 9 \nin diesel fuel amended ones (P < 0.05). The benefit of increasing temperature is particularly 10 \nobvious in diesel contaminated mineral soil mesocosms. In contrast, the best results of oil 11 \nhydrocarbons degradation were observed in organic soil mesocosms incubated at 10\u00b0C.  12 \n 13 \nDiscussion 14 \nThe present observations demonstrate the clear stimulating effect of oil addition on indigenous 15 \nbacteria in sub-Antarctic soil. Several orders of magnitude increase in bacterial abundance 16 \noccurred after both diesel and crude oil addition. These observations are in good agreement 17 \nwith previous results obtained from in situ studies in sub-Antarctic soils (Crozet Island) 18 \n(Coulon & Delille 2006, Delille et al., 2001, 2004). Biostimulation induced a clear increase of 19 \nthe number of hydrocarbon-degrading microbes. As noted by Rivet et al. (1993), some 20 \nincreases in bacterial numbers after Inipol EAP 22 addition may be attributed to the bacteria 21 \ngrowing on the oleic acid in the fertilizer. However the concomitant reduction of the residence 22 \ntime of the contaminants demonstrates the efficiency of the biostimulation. Despite that the 23 \nsame general pattern was observed in the two soils, the results indicate a serious influence of 24 \nthe soil properties on the observed biodegradation efficiencies. 25 \n 10 \nThe intensity of hydrocarbon biodegradation in soil is influenced by a number of site-specific 1 \nfactors (e.g. low temperature, low nutrient availability, low oxygen levels, soil structure, 2 \netc\u2026). Among them, it is well established that nutrients are one of the major factors limiting 3 \nhydrocarbon metabolization in soils (Mohn and Stewart, 2000). Inputs of large quantities of 4 \ncarbon sources (i.e., hydrocarbon contamination) tend to result in rapid depletion of the 5 \navailable pools of major inorganic nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Several studies 6 \nhave reported favourable effects of fertilizers on oil biodegradation at low temperatures in 7 \nArctic (Braddock et al., 1997, Whyte et al., 1999; Mohn and Stewart, 2000), alpine (Margesin 8 \nand Schinner 1997a,b; Margesin and Schinner 1999, Margesin et al. 2007) and Antarctic soils 9 \n(Kerry 1993; Wardell 1995; Aislabie et al., 1998; Delille 2000, Powell et al., 2006). 10 \nA possible reason for the inability of Inipol EAP 22\u00ae to greatly enhance hydrocarbon-11 \ndegrading microbes growth in organic soil is that nitrogen and phosphorus are not the major 12 \nlimiting factors in this soil.  Initial nitrogen concentrations naturally present were probably 13 \nhigh enough to sustain rapid intrinsic rates of biodegradation without addition of fertiliser. In 14 \naddition, particle size distribution, elemental analysis and water content of both sub-Antarctic 15 \nsoils were strongly different from each other. Thus, differences in the observed degradation 16 \nrates in both studied soils may be associated with the availability of the contaminants. 17 \nFurthermore, long-term in situ experiments demonstrated that the wet organic soil seems to be 18 \nmore efficient to retain some toxic compounds than the mineral one (Delille et al. 2007). This 19 \ndifference could have a direct influence on the mineralisation rate of hydrocarbons. 20 \nMicrobial metabolism is usually considered as a direct function of the temperature of the 21 \nenvironment (Leahy and Colwell 1990). Results of the present mesocosm experiments 22 \nindicate that a temperature increase can stimulate the microbial hydrocarbon degradation in 23 \nsub-Antarctic soils. However, the influence of temperature can differ greatly from a soil to 24 \nanother. We have no clear explanation of the difference of temperature sensitivity observed 25 \n 11 \nbetween the two soils used in the present experiment. However, these differences exist and 1 \ncannot be forgotten. 2 \nIn conclusion, the results obtained under the same experimental design differ greatly 3 \nfrom one soil to another, demonstrating a serious influence of the soil properties on the 4 \nbiostimulation efficiency. While spill management requires the development of a quick action 5 \nin response planning, the finding of this study reinforces the need to evaluate firstly the 6 \nfactors that control both the microbial activity and the degradation of organic compounds at a 7 \nspecific site. Whilst acknowledging the fundamental limitations of ex-situ bioremediation 8 \napproach in cold environments, this study demonstrated that ex-situ bioremediation is likely to 9 \nbe the strategy of choice for remediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated sub-Antarctic soils.  10 \n 11 \nAcknowledgements 12 \nThis research was supported by the French Polar Institute (IPEV) and the European Project 13 \nFACEiT (Fast Advanced Cellular and Ecosystems Information Technologies).  14 \n 15 \n 16 \nReferences 17 \n 18 \nAislabie, J (1997) Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in oil contaminated soils near Scott 19 \nBase, Antarctica.
