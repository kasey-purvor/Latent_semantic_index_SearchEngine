The overall concern\nof the paper is to explore the ways in which personal reflection and learning is enhanced through\ndialogue. The paper explores the ways learners engage in dialogue in two environments that use\ndifferent aspects of digital technologies to support the development of portfolios. The findings from\nthe case studies point to the ways in which different technologies facilitated personal reflection\nmediated through sharing and dialogue. We develop the idea of affordances as a relationship\nwhereby the learner is involved in a purposeful engagement with the possibilities created by their\nenvironment. The affordance of digitised technologies in supporting dialogue is, therefore, concep-\ntualised in relation to the characteristics of the learner, not as a simple technology relation.\nIntroduction\nThe development of portfolios and the use of personal reflection to promote learning\nin higher education contexts are of course not new. The focus on development of\nindependent learners is an international phenomenon. Nearly all national govern-\nments have been attempting to align their higher educational policies to the develop-\nment of human capital in ways that could yield competitive advantage in the context\nof globalised markets (Clegg et al., 2003). Edwards and Usher (2000), for example,\nargue that there is a shift in emphasis in educational policy and practice from what\nthey describe as the \u2018enlightened student\u2019 to \u2018autonomous\/self-directed\/flexible life-\nlong learners\u2019 (Edwards & Usher, 2000, p. 55). This shift marks a transition away\nfrom an emphasis on the acquisition of discipline and subject knowledge, towards an\nemphasis on the individual learner. These shifts have received a major policy boost in\n*Corresponding author. Learning and Teaching Institute, City Campus, Sheffield Hallam Univer-\nsity, Sheffield, S1 1WB, UK. Email: S.Clegg@shu.ac.uk\n4 S. Clegg et al.\nEngland with the new requirement on Higher Education Institutions to implement\nProgress Files in 2005\/06 (Quality Assurance Agency, 2001). It is timely, therefore,\nto look at developments using portfolios and to consider some current practice that\nis attempting to use digitised technology to support individual reflection through the\nsharing of ideas. Our concern in this paper is not with the customisation of systems\nto facilitate the recording aspects of portfolio development, which are receiving much\nattention elsewhere (Joint Information Systems Committee, 2002), but rather with\ninsights from smaller scale initiatives into the ways individualised learning can retain\nan essentially dialogical character (Koschmann, 1999).\nThere is considerable confusion and blurring of a number of practices in relation-\nship to portfolio development. While the national policy steer may create the impres-\nsion of a single focus, a cluster of terminology is currently being used to describe a\nvariety of overlapping practices. This includes Progress Files, Personal Portfolios,\nPersonal Development Planning, Professional Development Planning, Digitised\nPortfolios. This terminological confusion muddies claims about what is or can be\neffective (Gough et al., 2003; Clegg, 2004; Clegg & Bradley, forthcoming). However,\nin this paper we want explore some rather more general theoretical questions about\nthe nature of learning and the sorts of affordances between students and the learning\nenvironments involving new media.\nOur argument operates at two levels, one theoretical and the other involving the\nexploration of specific contexts. This is necessary because, while at a surface level it\nmay seem obvious that the sort of activity being encouraged is inherently individual-\nistic and \u2018personal\u2019, we believe there are good theoretical reasons for believing that\nlearning is inherently dialogic (Ashworth, 2004). There are sound pedagogical\nreasons, therefore, for designing this element into the production of personal portfo-\nlios. We argue that the emphasis on personal development is complementary to, and\nindeed enhanced by, learning in a collective context, where dialogue and interaction\ncan inform the creation of personal narratives. We have chosen to analyse data from\ntwo very different examples of how this occurs in practice. The advantage of looking\nat dissimilar cases is that it removes the idea of affordance from its location as a way\nof thinking about technology to a way of thinking about affordance \u2018defined and\nmeasured relationally, with respect to an intentional act\u2019 (Stoffregen, 2000, p. 7). Our\nclaim that it is possible to create the \u2018personal\u2019 in dialogue, and that this process may\nbe enhanced using the potential of new media, involves analysing the intentions of\nboth designers and learners as well as the different technologies. Our comparative\napproach also allows us to show how the meaning of \u2018portfolio\u2019 is located within\ndistinct disciplinary traditions.\nWe have structured the paper around the theoretical elaboration of our core\nconcerns with the personal in dialogue, and some observations about the way the\nconcept of affordances might help us understand the environment\/person relation-\nship; these form the first part of the paper. The second part of the paper presents data\nfrom two case studies. The two settings we will describe relate to the use of digital\nportfolios by students studying design and technology in Initial Teacher Education,\nand students on an International Masters Programme in E-learning, Multi-Media\nThe personal created through dialogue 5\nand Consultancy. In both cases interaction and dialogue form a component part of\nthe production of the personal statement, and in both cases the philosophy of reflec-\ntion is embedded within the specifics of the discipline.\nThe personal in dialogue\nThere are a number of traditions within which we can understand the fundamentally\ninterpersonal nature of human interaction and learning. The work of Lave and\nWenger (1991) has been enormously influential in thinking about the interpersonal\nnature of learning, and it is this fundamental insight that underpins their ideas of\nlegitimate peripheral participation: \nBriefly, a theory of social practice emphasises the relational interdependency of agent and\nworld, activity, meaning, cognition, learning and knowing. It emphasises the inherently\nsocially negotiated character of meaning and the interested, concerned character of the\nthought and actions of persons-in-activity. (Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 50\u201351)\nMore recently, Ashworth (2004) has argued the priority of a participatory hermeneu-\ntics in which dialogue and communication are paradigmatic. His intention is to high-\nlight the unique features of face-to-face interaction but the argument can be adduced\nfor the special place of interactive over non-interactive forms of communication.\nDrawing on the work of Gadamer (1989), Ashworth explores the role of\nforeknowledge, the interpretations and understanding that the student brings with\nthem, in learning. Entering into dialogue with others and attunement to their\nperspectives is crucial in learning. The student is confronted with new ideas and expe-\nriences, which are then reinterpreted in the light of their own starting points. In this\nsense, knowledge is always new for the student as it is part of the process of adjusting\ntheir own foreknowledge in new circumstances. Ashworth (2004) also reminds us of\nthe importance of sharing in the emotional and motivational aspects of learning.\nThe concept of dialogue is, therefore, fundamental, and Koschmann (1999) has\ndrawn on the work of Bakhtin to argue that it offers us a powerful way of thinking\nabout Computer Support for Collaborative Learning. McKenna (2004) has high-\nlighted the significance of the Bakhtinian construct of the reader-writer and argues\nthat the idea of addressivity is crucial to understanding how people write using\nelectronic media where the potential audience may be simultaneously both intimate\nand very wide. In line with these insights our argument is that dialogue should not be\nseen in contra-distinction to \u2018personal\u2019 knowledge and narratives. New knowledge of\nthe personal, which comes about through reflection on the process of learning, does\nnot occur in isolation but through the engagement with new frames of reference. The\nessentially dialogical nature of reflection includes tutor support for reflection\n(Bullock & Jamieson, 1998), but it can also involve action learning groups and other\nmechanisms designed to maximise support (Chivers, 2003). Indeed, one of the para-\ndoxes of greater individualisation and the need to create personal narratives is that\nthese increase inter-dependence rather than diminish it (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim,\n2002). The sorts of selves that can be created in contexts where individuals are being\n6 S. Clegg et al.\nexhorted to make them more employable, through creating distinctions between\nthemselves (their curriculum vitae) and others, depends on a high degree of attune-\nment to others\u2019 needs and perceptions (Beck & Beck-Gernsheim, 2002). Our argu-\nment is, therefore, that in conditions where personal reflection is paramount,\ndialogue becomes even more, not less, important.\nAffordance\nThe idea of affordance was developed in the context of visual perception (Gibson,\n1979) and has been highly influential in thinking about the ways in which meaning\nis attributed to different technologies, based on the perception of what that technol-\nogy makes possible\/dis-allows (Conole & Dyke, 2004). In particular, the concept\nhas become a vehicle for thinking through the ways in which Information and\nCommunication Technologies (ICT) is a medium that can enhance learning\n(Barnes, 2000). In the specific instance of this paper, our question is whether there\nare affordances that students and tutors perceive that encourage activities which\nsupport dialogue in project-based learning. The question is not simply a technologi-\ncal one. The fact that technologies (e.g. message boards, e-mail, etc.) permit\ndialogue does not mean that people perceive them in this way. E-mail, for example,\nwas designed, and often used, simply to facilitate organisational information flows,\nbut may unintentionally or intentionally facilitate dialogue. Other apparently inher-\nently non-dialogical packages (e.g. PowerPoint) may, in particular learning contexts,\nbecome a way of encouraging sharing and conversations, as is illustrated by one of\nour case studies.\nOur understanding of affordance has been influenced by Stoffregen (2000), who\nmakes a distinction between affordances and the perception of events. Whereas\nevents are properties of the external world, the concept of affordance focuses atten-\ntion on the relational aspects of the (human) animal and its environments, and specif-\nically on the properties of the animal in perceiving the possibilities afforded by that\nenvironment. This distinction is helpful as it shifts the focus away from the question\nof what the environment is, the world of events, to the perception of the possibilities\nof that environment. Stoffregen (2000) argues that perception of affordances may be\nmore accurate than the perception of environmental properties, in our case all the\nthings a particular ICT package can do. This chimes well with observations that users\nutilise only a fraction of the functionality of many systems, instead perceiving only\nthose parts that act as affordances rather than the full range of functionalities that go\nunnoticed. We recognise that there are perils associated with \u2018borrowing\u2019 concepts\nfrom other cognate domains, which are not one\u2019s own. The justification must there-\nfore be that they are useful in opening up questions and focusing attention on inter-\nesting aspects of learning environments. In this instance we believe there is good\ntheoretical warrant from within different theoretical traditions for focusing on the\nrelational and dialogue.\nIn our case studies we are interested in the affordances for dialogue in creating\npersonal portfolios. The affordances of virtual environments are different from those\nThe personal created through dialogue 7\nof the face to face, where gesture, expression, and the warmth that may be generated\nby reciprocity are features. Of course these features can have negative as well as posi-\ntive impacts: mis-reading of body language as indifference, or comments that act as\naffronts to a learner\u2019s dignity can dis-able learning. Our questions are about the ways\nin which different sorts of sharing (e.g. of artefacts and ongoing written reflections)\ncan constitute dialogue. We have chosen to conceptualise the personal in dialogue as\nthe starting point for assessing affordances, rather than simply the personal as such,\nas our professional understanding (Lave, 1988, 1996; Lave & Wenger, 1991) in\ndesigning these learning environments led us to believe that sharing is a powerful\nprompt to the elaboration of personal knowledge.\nCase study 1: International Masters Programme in e-Learning Multimedia \nand Consultancy\nPedagogical approach\nThe context for this case study is the International Masters Programme in e-Learning\nMultimedia and Consultancy (Sheffield Hallam University, UK). The Programme was\ndeveloped from the Advanced Curriculum Development Project supported by the\nEuropean Commission under the SOCRATES programme (1998\u20132001) and has\ninvolved an active partnership between Arnhem-Nijmegen University of Professional\nEducation in the Netherlands and Sheffield Hallam University in the United Kingdom.\nThe programme is embedded in professional practice and seeks to develop the profile\nof the \u2018problem solver\u2019\/team coordinator at the interface of pedagogical, technological\nand cultural dimensions of development.\nThe framework for the programme is founded on a socio-constructivist perspective\nof teaching and learning that places emphasis on communication, interaction and\ncollaboration. The programme as a whole is framed within a Virtual Learning\nEnvironment. It has an international student cohort and a tutor team from partner\nuniversities. It is designed to integrate online learning, local studies and independent\nlearning, and it emphasises the importance of peer and formative assessment\npractices.\nIn designing and planning the programme considerable emphasis has been placed\non enabling collaborative activity in multinational teams. In relation to this aspect we\nshare the general perspective offered and the distinction between cooperation and\ncollaboration made by Lehtinen et al. (1999). They highlight the way in which\nresearch on the role of collaboration in learning has searched for more meaningful\ntheoretical frameworks that could better guide the development of technology-aided\nlearning environments. They also highlight the distinction between cooperation and\ncollaboration based on different ideas of the role and participation of individual\nmembers in the activity. A project-based and team-based approach towards learning\nunderpins each module of the programme, which involves a gradual shifting balance\nfrom more directed and supported learning to more independent learning, through\nthe lifespan of each module.\n8 S. Clegg et al.\nThe module\nThe specific context for this case study is the second module of the programme, the\nDigital Media Applications (DMA) module. This module aims to enable students to\ndevelop an overview and a critical appreciation of the development process and the\npotential and limitations of DMA.\nThe module involves working online in international project teams to produce a\nDMA prototype. The activity is used as the basis for personal reflection, the outcomes\nfrom which are compiled into a digital portfolio (Figure 1). The portfolio reflects the\nfollowing aspects: \n\u25cf A team report including the DMA prototype, the project aims and objectives, the\nproject design and development plan, technical specifications and copyright\nissues, and the evaluation of the prototype and recommendations for further\ndevelopment.\n\u25cf A personal evaluation of the development process with evidence of individual\ncontributions to the team effort.\n\u25cf A personal critical reflection on the learning process with reference to DMA and\nICT developments.\nFigure 1. An example of a digital portfolio (permission to use this example granted by the student)The digital portfolio is the main means of summative assessment in the DMA\nmodule. An aspect of the portfolio and of the learning process is an ongoing reflec-\ntive diary that students post in the open learning environment. The diary is seen as\none technique for accumulating data as part of an action learning approach\nFigure 1. An example of a digital portfolio (permission to use this example granted by the student)\nThe personal created through dialogue 9\n(Kember, 2000) and is intended as an aid for promoting systematic reflection on\nlearning and as a tool for linking theory with practice. Within the context of their\nportfolio the students are asked to provide an account based on their personal reflec-\ntion of the process of developing the DMA prototype and of their learning. The\nreflective diary is used as a means to support this process. By reflecting systematically\non experience at an individual level, the aim is to help link theory with practice at the\nwider social and communal level.\nResearch study 1\nMethod\nThe starting point for the research was the standard approach towards module eval-\nuation through means such as end-of-unit questionnaires to both staff and students.\nIn addition, we have adopted an ethnographic approach with the aim of exploring\nemergent issues as they arise naturally through the process of enquiry. In relation to\nthis aspect we have found the approach of responsive evaluation outlined by Stake\n(1976) to be particularly relevant. This approach aims to be responsive to the\nconcerns and issues of the \u2018stakeholders\u2019 involved in evaluation.\nAs part of the DMA module students keep an ongoing diary in the open learning\nenvironment. The diary is seen as one technique for accumulating data as part of an\naction learning approach. An agreed statement of research ethics was negotiated at\nthe outset of the project to allow the diaries to be used as a source of data collection\nwith the aim of following up emergent themes in seeking to achieve a responsive mode\nof enquiry. In total, 10 diaries were analysed by an independent researcher working\nclosely with the course team at an early stage in the development of the programme\n(Hudson et al., 2002). In addition, at the end of the module, students complete an\nonline questionnaire and contribute to an end-of-module discussion with their tutors\nat the local centres. The questionnaire was a means of collecting data on the student\nexperience and of investigating the importance and meaning of being part of a learn-\ning community. This ongoing action research process has taken place over a four-year\nperiod and has involved up to 80 students.\nFindings\nFive inter-related and overlapping themes emerged from the analysis of the diaries.\nThese were: listing of process, culture, language, communication and collaboration.\nOther significant threads that emerged were around the areas of action and activities,\nobligation and identity (Hudson et al., 2002).\nThe diary entries represented snapshots of the students\u2019 learning experiences,\nwhich are in turn utilised as study aids. The reflective component of the diary was\ndesigned to encourage students to think and re-examine their actions and activities,\ntheir obligations, and their sense of identity as students working together within an\ninternational and virtual context.\n10 S. Clegg et al.\nThe way in which the diaries were used at different times reflects the range of learn-\ning opportunities that are provided in the use of such a strategy. A diary is generally\nperceived as a personal and private thing, yet in this context it was available for every-\none to see and comment on, which provided an interesting insight into how the diary\nwas perceived at different times and the specific functions it performed. The value of\nbeing able to share issues openly was instrumental in encouraging other team\nmembers and tutors to engage in wide-ranging discussion.\nThe ongoing evaluation has highlighted the importance of dialogue within the\ncontext of collaboration. This was emphasised by one student who argued that\ncollaboration in any environment is about needing each other. \nTo open a discussion, to publish work or ask a question, in short to let people know where\nyou are in knowledge, thinking and questions is the only way to learn and get the support\nyou need. The feedback and comments are essential to learning.\nCase study 2: e-portfolios for Design and Technology\nPedagogical approach\nThis case study examined the work of 41 Initial Teacher Education students studying\nDesign and Technology with Qualified Teacher Status at Sheffield Hallam University.\nStudents complete a module developing their ability to design and manufacture prod-\nucts using a range of skills, processes and materials. This also involves the presentation\nof a portfolio of evidence to support a number of physical product outcomes they\ndesign and manufacture. The compilation process is valued for a number of reasons,\nincluding: \n\u25cf Organising resources arising from the students\u2019 research to inform decision-\nmaking.\n\u25cf Assisting the designer to reflect on decisions made and their own learning.\n\u25cf Providing a focus to inform discussion with others and providing an archive for\nacademic accreditation.\nHowever, the effectiveness of this process in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and\nability to develop reflective capability has been questioned. Whereas annotation\nwithin the portfolio is encouraged, submissions do not lend themselves readily to the\nactive recording of reflection. Hence the articulation of thought processes critical for\nboth reinforcing learning and providing valuable insight for the tutor is missing.\nReflection tends to be restricted to short annotations relating to the product design\nand ideas being developed but not to the learning taking place.\nDeveloping students\u2019 understanding as to the true value of compiling a portfolio is\nadvantageous and provides a mechanism for prompting reflection. \nDesign learning should strive towards the situation where new designers constantly reflect\nupon and critically examine their design practice. They should regard the design practice\nitself as a result of a design process and therefore possible to change and redesign.\n(Stolterman, 1994, p. 458)\nThe personal created through dialogue 11\nAlthough use is made of digital technology to generate the content of a portfolio, the\ncommon perception remains that, in order to make it accessible to others, it must first\nbe transferred to paper. This traditional approach may be restricting the benefit that\ncan be drawn from the compilation and subsequent use of portfolio documenting\nactivity. The use of IT enables students to undertake and engage in increasingly\nsophisticated design activity, but also has potential to assist organisation and reflec-\ntion. Only limited exploration of the potential for this has been carried out in the area\nof design and technology education.\nThe module\nThe concept of an \u2018e-portfolio\u2019 was introduced to the cohort, and the requirement\nwas made that they compiled this ready for submission at the end of the module. An\ne-portfolio is a means of combining textual and visual material together digitally, in a\nform that can be transmitted and read electronically. Students were required to use\nMicrosoft PowerPoint to create their e-portfolios and upload them to a specially\ncreated \u2018Blackboard\u2019 e-learning \u2018site\u2019 accessible only to the group through the univer-\nsity website. The site also contained exemplar material and resources to inform their\nown design process. Although specialist portfolio packages are available, PowerPoint\nwas selected due to its ease of use. It is also commonly available so students were able\nto transfer their work between machines both inside and outside the university as\nnecessary. The advantages and simplicity of PowerPoint were illustrated, and empha-\nsis was placed on the need to keep presentations simple and not use an excessive array\nof effects provided within the software. Individual e-portfolios were limited to five\nannotated slides providing reflection and comment using the Notes facility available\nin the software. This important aspect enabled recording of reflection that was to\nremain private between tutor and student. Portfolios were posted on Blackboard and\nmade available as a PowerPoint show, thus enabling students to view each other\u2019s\nwork and share in the design process but not allowing student access to the reflection\nand comments contained in the Notes facility.\nResearch study 2\nMethod\nThe researchers were concerned with the students\u2019 experience, the nature of the\nlearning and the outcomes produced rather than the evaluation of specific software.\nA qualitative approach was taken to enquire into the attitudes of the participants in\nthe pilot project. The researchers were interested in examining how production of the\ne-portfolio contributed to the learning process of students completing this module\nand their views about the use of PowerPoint as a means of sharing the design process.\nData were collected from multiple sources\u2014questionnaires, semi-structured inter-\nviews and the portfolio reflections\u2014allowing triangulation. A total of 25 question-\nnaires were returned from the cohort of 41, and 24 interviews were conducted\n12 S. Clegg et al.\nindividually and in small groups. The researcher also independently analysed a\nsample of the portfolios. All the data collection and analysis was undertaken by an\nindependent researcher working alongside the course team (Mitchell et al., 2003).\nFindings\nThe value of reflection and its recording as a tool to enhance learning both as work\nprogresses and summatively is seen as important. One student reported: \nI think the realisation that others were going to see your work made me more reflective and\ncritical of my work to date.\nSome felt that working electronically had a positive effect and actively assisted their\nability to reflect on their practice. Inexperience in the use of PowerPoint seemed to\nhave little effect on students\u2019 perceived ability to be reflective. Sixty-eight per cent felt\nconfident in their ability to be reflective and record, regardless of their experience.\nHowever, the nature of much of the reflective comment tended toward description.\nThe results indicated that additional teaching in the use of reflective techniques\nwould benefit the majority of students. Attention needs drawing to the benefits of\ngenerating a critical dialogue, recording the iterative process between thinking and\ndoing associated with designing and making.\nA number of conclusions can be drawn from the experience that will be used to\ninform future developments in the use of e-portfolios in this course. Those students\nwith limited IT experience would benefit from additional training in the use of\nPowerPoint and digital imaging. Acquisition of these skills would be enhanced by\nmaking exemplar e-portfolios available electronically, including reflective notes.\nNo framework was provided except the stipulation over the number of slides and\nthe need to display a representative range of communication techniques developed\nduring the module. Some students reported that they would feel more secure if a\nmore structured format had been provided. A lack of clarity about what was expected\nled to some confusion over the extent to which the portfolio was being assessed for\npresentation as opposed to reflection. It is likely, however, that over-prescription may\nimpact on the opportunity for creativity in the compilation of the e-portfolio.\nSome students displayed a general lack of clarity about the use of reflection, and in\nparticular its use in the distillation of thinking and its effect on refining decision\nmaking. As a consequence there was a tendency to leave the compilation of the elec-\ntronic portfolio to the end. This can be partly explained by the lack of experience and\ninitial confidence in compiling their first e-portfolio, suggesting the need for further\nguidance as to the purpose and value of the e-portfolio, and more encouragement to\nspread its compilation to run concurrently with the process of designing and making.\nThis is consistent with Tomlinson\u2019s suggestion that: \n\u2026 reflective thinking should not just occur before or after the action but if possible also in\nthe midst of it. (1999a, p. 408)\nThe quality of submitted work was considered by tutors to represent an improvement\non previous cohorts\u2019 paper-based versions. Students expressed the view that, as their\nThe personal created through dialogue 13\nwork was going to be put on show and viewed by others (peers), they were highly\nselective as to what they included. For many students, digitising their work provided\nthem with the opportunity to improve the presentation quality.\nStudents benefited from being able to view their peers\u2019 submissions via Blackboard\nat the end of the module. This enabled them to see their work in a group context and\ngain substantially from observing evidence of others\u2019 design activity, including differ-\nent approaches and subsequent outcomes. One student summarised this as: \nMy learning experience has been enhanced by sharing information with my peers. This is\nan ideal way to see other people\u2019s work and get an idea of how they feel about the course.\nConclusions\nWe suggested in our introduction that the concept of affordance is useful in highlight-\ning the relational aspects of the perception and of the capacity of perceiving the possi-\nbilities afforded by an environment. In both our examples it was the pedagogical\nvision of course designers, based on both theoretical understanding and practice, and\ngrounded in disciplinary know-how, that structured those aspects of the media\nemployed. This orientation shifts the concern with media per se to the particularities\nof pedagogical purpose. The actual media used were suited to the context: in one\ncase, an off-the-shelf common package that required relatively low levels of comput-\ning skill in the preparation of the portfolio, but with the capacity for enabling the\nvisual aspects of the design process to be shared; in the other case, a more sophisti-\ncated Web-designed environment that allowed for greater connectivity between\nelements. This diversity and plurality is a feature not only of the case studies reported\nhere, but of the many of the close-to-practice reports in the literature of academics\nexperimenting with new media. This can create frustration, as it means that, at the\nlevel of description, each case appears unique and, therefore, the learning from these\nexperiments is not easily generalised. However, by asserting the primacy of pedagogic\npurpose in the perception of affordances offered by the media, the debate can be\nshifted to where it properly belongs, namely the underlying principles\u2014in our case,\nthe importance of the dialogic in reflective activity.\nBoth our examples suggest that dialogue and the ability of students to share in\nthe processes that contribute to the production of a portfolio appear to be key. The\nparticular affordances of new media in enabling this form of exchange in ways that\nin paper-based systems are more cumbersome, or even impossible, is therefore a\ncrucial design element. We believe that by designing in dialogue, personal reflection\ncan be enhanced by making visible (both literally and metaphorically) the processes\ninvolved in creating a portfolio. This is not without difficulties. The Design and\nTechnology students, in particular, found the articulation of process hard. This\nshould not surprise us as the reflective practice literature (Tomlinson, 1999a,\n1999b; Clegg et al., 2002) has drawn attention to the importance of the tacit and\nnon-cognitive aspects of practice. However, we believe there is good theoretical and\npractical pedagogical warrant for conceptualising the individualisation involved in\nreflective self as involving greater levels of interpersonal awareness and attunement.\n14 S. Clegg et al.\nThe choice of whether to use e-portfolios should be shaped by these underlying\nconsiderations, rather than the functionality of any particular Virtual Learning\nEnvironment. The perception of affordances of any particular media rests with the\nskills of the course designer in recognising his\/her pedagogical purposes. The chal-\nlenge for us as practitioners and researchers is to try to make these processes explicit\nand to model them in the creation of learning environments that make active\ndialogue a possibility.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank John Steel and Sally Bradley, respectively, who were\nthe independent researchers involved in the original data collection and analysis.\nFuller co-authored accounts of the case studies are referred to in the text and appear\nin the reference list.\nReferences\nAshworth, P.
