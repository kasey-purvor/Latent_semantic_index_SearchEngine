The \ntextual description of moving images at different \nlevels of abstraction can be explored in the context of \nmoving images from a specialist domain, such as \nsequences of dance.  The KAB system annotates \nvideo using collateral texts about dances produced by \nexperts.  The analysis of dance, by experts, is \ngrounded in theories of aesthetics and semiotics: the \npotential contribution of such theories to a framework \nfor multimedia computing is discussed.  \n \n1 Introduction \nThe retrieval of a part or the whole of a moving \nimage from a systematically organised collection \ndepends upon how each moving image, and parts of \neach, are described.  In order that images can be \naccessed across different systems, by many people, \nand for a variety of purposes, it is necessary to attach \ndescriptions to them, following a well developed \nscheme.  The MPEG-7 standard is being developed to \nprovide a description definition language from \nwhich description schemes and descriptors can be \nspecified [1].   \nDescriptors may comprise colour, texture and \nmotion information about moving images \u2013 a low \nlevel abstraction.  Alternatively, descriptors may be \ntext strings which are implicitly loaded with meaning \n\u2013 for example, a dance sequence can be analysed in \nterms of sophisticated movements like pli\u00e9, pirouette \nand rond de jambe.  Such terms convey detailed \ninformation about the moving image which one may \nconstrue as a high-level description.  Traditional \ninformation retrieval can, in principle, be used to \nindex, and subsequently retrieve, moving images \nlabelled with such terms.  Image and video database \nsystems may use both low and high-level descriptors \n[2]; in some cases the high-level descriptors are \nderived from textual information occurring in video, \nlike speech and subtitles [3]. \nThe analytical delineation of levels of image \ndescription is important since research problems at  \nlow, high and intermediate levels are complex.  \nFischler and Firschein proposed the phrase \u2018signal to \nsymbols paradigm\u2019 to characterise how research in \ncomputer vision addresses this range of levels [4].  \nHowever, whilst much research in computer vision \nand image indexing has addressed low-level image \nanalysis, there is perhaps a need for frameworks in \nwhich higher-level, conceptual descriptions of visual \ninformation can be produced [5]. \nFor us, the discussion about how to describe \nhigh-level visual information in abstract and \nschematic ways should be grounded in two respects.  \nFirst, we should choose exemplar images that are \naesthetically interesting and highly stylised.  Second, \nthere should be an archive of texts, produced by \nexperts, that elucidate these images in depth. The \nphrase \u2018collateral text\u2019 may be used to refer to such \ndescriptions and interpretations of moving images, \nextending its previous use of denoting newspaper \nphotograph captions [6]. \nMoving images of dance are both aesthetically \ninteresting and highly stylized.  Furthermore, when \nspeaking and writing about dance sequences, experts \ncan analyse them at different levels of abstraction.   \nThis paper describes how knowledge-rich content \ndescriptions of dances were obtained from experts \nand used to annotate and subsequently browse a \ndigital video library of dance.  \n2 Aesthetics and semiotics of moving images \nDancers and dance scholars provide interesting \nimages and symbol systems for investigating video \nannotation.  Dance scholars can describe the dancing \nbody in terms of its parts, or as a part of a greater \nwhole \u2013 when groups of dancers form patterns.  An \nanalysis of a dance might classify it in terms of its \ngenre, or may focus on short, but significant \nsequences to analyse in detail.  At various stages in \nan analysis the movements of the dance may be \ndescribed, possibly with the aid of a movement \nnotation system, and interpreted \u2013 to explicate the \nsignificance of movements and the narrative of the \ndance.  In both cases dance experts write and talk \nabout moving images with a minimum of redundancy \nwhilst innovating new descriptions for previously \nunseen movements.  Their analyses appear in a \nvariety of types of text including dance previews, \nreviews, journal articles and textbooks.  \nTypically, those involved in the analysis of \nmoving images, either in the context of film, like \nChristian Metz [7], or in the context of dance, like \nJanet Adshead [8], have discussed these images both \nin relation to a generic description of their contents \nand a specific description.  Further, moving images \nare discussed in terms of their \u2018aboutness\u2019 at a more \nabstract level. \nFor instance, Metz describes images at the \nphysical level \u2013 where visual phenomena become \nperceptually meaningful as generic contents; the \ndiegetic level \u2013 which comprises the specific 4D \nspatio-temporal world posited by the moving image; \nand the connotative and sub-textual levels in which \nthe aboutness of moving images is conveyed by \nmetaphorical meanings and specialised symbols. \nAdshead\u2019s analysis of dance is also at four levels, \ndescription of movements, discernment of form, \ninterpretation and evaluation.  Here the description of \nmovements relates to the level of generic contents; the \ngrouping of these elements into forms relates to the \nspecific contents; and the aboutness of the dance is \nexplicated by interpretation and evaluation. \nThe work of Metz and of Adshead can be related \nto earlier work on images, albeit still images, by the \nart scholar Erwin Panofsky [9].  For Panofsky, the \nthree levels of meaning in a painting were: the pre-\niconographic, comprising the generic contents, e.g. a \nman in a city; the iconographic, forming the specific \ncontents, e.g. a particular man in a particular city; \nand the iconological, that is what the painting is \nabout, e.g. politics, war, peace. \nThe frameworks of Panofsky, Metz and \nAdshead are presented in Table 1.  Note that there is \na fifth level of contents discussed by Metz which is of \nrelevance to the description of video: this relates to \ncinematic features such as cuts, pans and zooms - it \nis not included in Table 1 as it has no analogue in the \nrealms of paintings or dance.  (Lindley and \nSrinivasan [10] have described the work of Metz in \nsome detail as the basis of a video generation system; \nShatford [11] proposed the use of Panofsky\u2019s \nframework as the basis for organising picture \ncollections). \nTable 1: Frameworks for the analysis of images. \nImages \nFilm: Metz [7] Art: Panofsky [9] Dance: Adshead \n[8] \nPhysical \n\u201cvisual \nphenomena \nbecome \nperceptually \nmeaningful\u201d \n \nDiegetic \n\u201cthe 4-D spatio-\ntemporal world \nposited by the \nfilm\u201d \n \nConnotative \n\u201cmetaphorical, \nanalogical and \nassociative \nmeanings\u201d \n \nSub-textual \n\u201cspecialised \nmeanings of \nsymbols and \nsignifiers\u201d \n \n \nPre-iconographic \n\u201cgeneric who, \nwhat, where, \nwhen\u201d \n \n \n \nIconographic \n\u201cspecific who, \nwhat, where, \nwhen\u201d \n \n \nIconological \n\u201cabstract \naboutness\u201d \nDescription of \nmovements \n\u201ca recording of \nmovements\u201d \n \n \nDiscernment of \nform \n\u201cthe meaningful \ngrouping of \nmovements in \nspace and time\u201d \n \nInterpretation \n\u201cgenre and \nsubject matter\u201d \n \nEvaluation \n\u201caesthetic \nqualities and \nartistic \nstatement\u201d \n \n \n3 Knowledge-rich Video Annotation \nIn order to study how video can be annotated with \ntextual information, an investigative method has been \ndeveloped in which an expert \u2018thinks out loud\u2019 whilst \nviewing a moving image.  This method is based on \nProtocol Analysis [12] and assumes that an expert\u2019s \nverbalization reflects their cognitive activity when \nperceiving and understanding the moving image.  \nWhen transcribed, the verbalization, or \n\u2018commentary\u2019, is a symbolic expression of some of \nthe video\u2019s contents - based on the expert\u2019s \nknowledge and aligned in time with the video.  There \nare different aspects of video content which an expert \ncan talk about, but only one speech channel available \nto them.  The experts can be guided by instructions to \nfocus on different contents of the video according to \nthe levels of analysis in Table 1. \nFive dance experts twice watched 20 minutes of \ndance video (comprising excerpts from four dances).  \nThey were first given an instruction to \u2018Describe\u2019 the \ndance; on the second viewing they were asked to \n\u2018Interpret\u2019 (see Table 1 for this distinction).  To date, \n38 (out of 50) commentaries have been transcribed \nwith timecodes attached to each speech fragment (25 \ntexts from the \u2018Describe\u2019 task, 11,300 words; and 13 \ntexts from the \u2018Interpret\u2019 task, 6,289 words). \nDance experts have at their disposal a specialist \nvocabulary with which to describe dance.  An \nanalysis of the commentaries showed that 14 terms \npresent in Koegler\u2019s Concise Oxford Dictionary of \nBallet were used by experts in the \u2018Describe\u2019 task.  \nSome of these refer to positions held by dancers, \narabesque (22 occurrences) and attitude (24); some \nto general kinds of movement adagio (1) - slow, and \nbatterie (1) - with beating legs; and others to \nparticular types of movement, pirouette (6) - turning \non one leg with foot touching knee; and, promenade \n(1) - turning slowly with body held in a set position. \nDefinitions of these specialist terms can be given \nin the form of movement notation, such as the \nLabanotation system, Fig. 1.  \n \nFig. 1: Labanotation definitions for two forms of \npirouette - en attitude and en arabesque.  (From The \nGail Grant Dictionary of Classical Ballet in \nLabanotation). \nLabanotation is read from bottom to top.  \nSymbols to the left of the centre refer to movements \nmade by the left foot, leg, torso, arm, hand and head \n\u2013 in that order.  The symbols\u2019 points, shadings and \nsizes represent the movement dynamics of direction, \nlevel of extension and duration. \nIn the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet \nspecialist dance terms, like pirouette, are explained in \ngeneral language: \n \n \n \nPirouette (Fr., spinning-top).  Designates \nin ballet one or more turns of the body on one \nleg (on half or full point), with the point of \nthe working leg generally touching the knee of \nthe supporting leg.  It can be executed \u00e0 la \nseconde, en attitude, en arabesque, or sur le \ncoup-de-pied. \nThe dictionary entry notes that they are various \nforms of pirouette, including en attitude.  The \ndefinition for attitude gives more detail about body \nposition and some historical information: \nAttitude (Fr.).  A position of the body \ninspired by Giovanni da Bologna\u2019s statue of \nMercury, and codified by Blasis.  The body is \nsupported on one leg with the other behind, the \nknee bent at an angle of 90\u00ba, turned out, with \nthe knee higher than the foot.  The \ncorresponding arm is raised above the head, \nwhile the other arm is extended to the side.  \nThe various national schools have developed \ndifferent variants.  It can be executed in \nseveral ways: relev\u00e9e, saut\u00e9e, en tournant en \navant (or en arri\u00e8re), effac\u00e9e, crois\u00e9e, etc. \nDefinitions of specialist dance terms include \nmovement words from general language.  Thus, \npirouette is a particular type of turn (or to pirouette \nis to turn in a particular kind of way).  Doing a \npirouette involves other actions \u2013 a leg supporting \nthe body and the touching of a knee with a foot.  The \npirouette can be executed in a number of ways, \nincluding en attitude \u2013 in which case one arm will be \nraised above the head and the other extended to the \nside. \nGeneral language words for describing the \npositions and movements of the human body, were \nprominent in the commentaries elicited from the \ndance experts.  The 100 most frequent words used in \nthe \u2018Describe\u2019 and \u2018Interpret\u2019 tasks (excluding closed \nclass words) are shown in Tables 2a and 2b \nrespectively. \nTable 2a: 100 most frequent words used in the \n\u2018Describe\u2019 task (excluding closed class words) : note \nthat the words in each cell are in frequency order. \nDancers, \nbodies and \nsurroundings \nman, arms, character, swan, hands, dancers, \nleg, arm, head, male, floor, body, dancer, \npeople, men, legs, feet, couples, woman, \nfoot, female, hand, stage, women, \nbackground, heads, partner, shoulder, \nperson, swans, figure, chest, bodies, couple, \nneck \nMovements \nand positions \nposition, moving, movement, movements, \nstanding, holding, balance, turns, turn, \nturning, jumps, going, jumping, attitude, \nlying, steps, supporting, kneeling, walking, \ngesture, circle, motif, positions, action, \narabesque, looking, goes, lifting, twisting, \ntouching, pli\u00e9, gestures, duet, balancing, \nfollowing, leaps, facing, bent, shaking, \npoint, move, jump, spins, stroking, holds, \nsitting, moves, walks, contact, lifted, come, \nleans \nMovement \nqualities \nslow, little, big, unison, slowly, extended, \nquick, small, gestural, flexed, sustained, \nlyrical \nTable 2b: 100 most frequent words used in the \n\u2018Interpret\u2019 task (excluding closed class words) : note \nthat the words in each cell are in frequency order. \nDancers, \nbodies & \nsurroundings \nswan, man, male, character, dancers, swans, \npeople, arms, men, prince, woman, female, \nbodies, body, dancer, leg, wings, moon, \nhand, hands, birds, background, floor, group, \nstage, heads, women, figure \nMovements \nand positions \nmovement, movements, looking, moving, \nsupporting, touching, duet, support, unison, \nholding, coming, going, gesture, action, \ncircle, lifting, move, point, position, \nstillness, manipulating, leaving, comes, \nmoves, come, dance, standing, twisting, \npicking, flight, solo, lying, reaching, trying, \ncurve, contact, dancing, following, lifted, \npulling \nMovement \nqualities \nstrong, strength, formal, caring, \nindependently, enjoying, physical, slowly, \naggressive, longing, little, slow, gentle, \ngestural, religious, underwater \nOther relationship, sense, images, idea, suggesting, \nimportant, fantasy, suggests, significant, \ncamera, presence, exist, significance, roles, \nreferences, lake  \n \nThese results show a range of terms with which \nan expert can analyse a dance sequence by extracting \nsalient patterns of movement.  The terms include \nspecialist terms like arabesque and pli\u00e9 and general \nlanguage terms like turns, jumps, and spins.  The \nrelative frequency of terms might indicate where the \nfocus of the experts\u2019 attentions lie when they analyse \ndance, for example arms and hands are more \nfrequent than legs and feet. \nThe contrasting contents of Tables 2a and 2b \nperhaps reflects the differences between the level of \ngeneric contents (elicited by the \u2018Describe\u2019 task) and \nthe level of metaphoric and associated meanings \n(elicited by the \u2018Interpret\u2019 task).  In the case of Table \n2b, words like prince and wings are being used as \nwell as man and arms to refer to the dancers; \nmovements include flight and manipulating; and the \nmovement qualities are more expressive e.g. \naggressive and gentle \u2013 there are also suggestions of \nmovement having a religious quality and looking like \nit is happening underwater. \n \nThe KAB System \nThe KAB system (Knowledge-rich Annotation and \nBrowsing) has been developed to analyse collateral \ntexts alongside digital video, combining automatic \ntechniques for text analysis with a video database \nfollowing that of [13].  Texts analysis techniques are \nused to generate lists of candidate terms for \nannotation, from experts\u2019 commentaries and extant \nwritten texts.  Video objects in the form {start time: \nend time: term} are generated from time-coded \ntranscripts and organised term lists to annotate the \nvideo, Fig.2.  The video collection is browsed through \nthe same lists of terms.  The system currently \nattaches video objects to sequences of frames: with \nthe prospect of object-based video coding (e.g. \nMPEG-4) it will be important to study how \nannotations can be attached to particular entities in \nthe video, e.g. dancers. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2: Video annotation in KAB.

A \nvideo object is created with start and end times. \n4 Discussion and closing remarks \nCollateral texts for video annotation \nThe analysis of experts\u2019 terms shows how they can \nbe rich in meaning, compared to say a movement \nnotation: this perhaps supports the use of textual \ndescriptions for video annotation.  However the \napproach has received relatively little attention in \nmultimedia systems research.  This may be due to \nthree reasons: (i) the diverse ways in which visual \ninformation can be perceived and understood makes \nhuman descriptions unwieldy in a formal \ncomputational context; (ii) human involvement in the \nindexing process introduces subjectivity; (iii) the cost \nof human resources for indexing large quantities of \nvisual information.  \nWith regards to point (i), multimedia research \ncan perhaps adapt frameworks from aesthetic fields \nfor organising descriptions of image and video \ncontent.  Variance in annotation due to human \nsubjectivity will perhaps be less likely when dealing \nwith experts in specialist domains who have \nestablished methods for analysing images: we found \nthat this seemed to be the case when looking at \ncommentaries of the same dance elicited from \ndifferent experts.  As for the expense of manual \nindexing methods, it should be noted that there may \nbe cases in which lengthy and expensive manual \nindexing effort is economical because it allows many \npeople to access information effectively.  Methods \nshould nevertheless aim to minimise levels of human \ninput by integrating automated image analysis \nprocesses.  \n \nAesthetics and semiotics for multimedia systems \nThe creation of a description definition language  \nmay be seen as akin to the creation of a meta-\nlanguage: perhaps then, multimedia research can \nbenefit from the work of scholars in aesthetics and \nsemiotics who have investigated the \u2018Languages of \nArt\u2019 [14], \u2018Film Language\u2019 [7], \u2018The Languages of \nImages\u2019 [15] and \u2018The Search for the Perfect \nLanguage\u2019 [16].  We have previously suggested that \nresearch in multimedia computing can share a \nsymbiotic relationship with research in aesthetics and \nsemiotics, such as that shared between research in \nnatural language processing and linguistics [17].   \nOthers have also made cases for grounding \nvarious aspects of multimedia computing research in \nsemiotic frameworks.  Some of these viewpoints \nemphasise the syntactic properties of the multimedia \ndocument: the semiotic terminology of Charles \nSanders Peirce has been used in a model of media \nobjects that reflects the nature of different signs, their \nmodality and the ways they are arranged to achieve \ncommunication [18].  According to another \nresearcher, who discusses the semiotic theory of \nCharles Morris, \u2018generating suitable data models for \nhypermedia requires the identification of the semiotic \narticulation in multimedia data\u2019 [19].  \nIn contrast, some proposals have emphasised the \nimportance of studying the production and \nunderstanding of multimedia artefacts: a study of \nvideo production was guided by the work of a film \ntheorist, Dudley Andrew [20]; and the understanding \nof multimedia information has been discussed in \nrelation to Umberto Eco\u2019s ideas regarding the \u2018Role \nof the Reader\u2019 [21].  The importance of considering \nthe purposes for which multimedia documents are \ncreated has also been noted, with reference to three \ntypes of text delimited by Seymour Chatman, \n\u2018description\u2019, \u2018argument\u2019 and \u2018narrative\u2019: this \nclassification motivated a structure for hypermedia \ndocuments [22]. \nThe domains of aesthetics and semiotics are \nbroad and have long histories.  The applicability of \nanalytic frameworks for characterising \u2018levels of \nabstraction\u2019 for multimedia information was \ndescribed in this paper.  Examining the potential \ncontribution of aesthetic and semiotic theories to \nvideo annotation is part of our ongoing research [23].  \nOf particular interest are (i) theories which seek to \nuntangle definitions of media and modes [24]; (ii) \ntheories which explore how the understanding of a \ntext depends on networks of related texts known by \nthe reader, the so-called phenomenon of \n\u2018intertextuality\u2019 [25]; and (iii) theories which discuss \nthe differences between visual and verbal \ncommunication and suggest how images and words \ncan be related [26]. \n \nReferences \n[1] MPEG-7 (1998).  \u2018MPEG-7 Context and Objectives\u2019.  \nISO\/IEC JTC1\/SC29\/WG11 N2460, MPEG\/98, October \n1998\/Atlantic City, USA. \n[2] Flickner, M. et al.
