In areas such as asylum and immigration, terrorism \ncontrol, criminal justice, and \u2018community cohesion\u2019, there has been a cumulative \nabjuration of core elements of New Labour policies (Amin 2002; Back et al. 2002; \nBowling and Phillips 2002; Alexander 2004; Schuster and Solomos 2004; Burchardt \n2005; Phillips 2005). In the race arena, New Labour\u2019s aspirations were first \nexercised when it established a public inquiry into the police investigation of \nStephen Lawrence\u2019s racist murder. Following the barren years of the Conservative \nadministration, the subsequent Macpherson Report (1999) acted as a catalyst for \nchange. The Lawrence Inquiry team\u2019s indictment of institutional racism laid at the \ndoor of the police service and other pillars of the establishment was regarded by \nmany commentators as a \u2018watershed\u2019 and \u2018benchmark\u2019 in British race relations \n(Brah 1996; Bourne 2001). Perhaps even criminal justice professionals and \nacademics were partially swayed by the seeming consensus of public and political \nopinion that castigated the police for their incompetence and endemic racism. \nWhile the subsequent reform programme offered promise, it would be rose-tinted \nretrospection not to acknowledge a well-honed cynicism about the likelihood of \nreal change, a concern that eliminating institutional racism might only be the \npolitical flavour of the moment, whilst the threat of backlash was (as ever) \nomnipresent (Dennis, Erdos and Al-Shahi 2000). \nNew Labour\u2019s response to the Macpherson Report (1999) was a myriad of \npolicy proposals of which the centrepiece was the Race Relations (Amendment) \nAct 2000 (Home Office 1999). As was the case with the earlier Scarman Report \n(1981) on the policing of black communities, the employment practices of criminal \n 1\n justice agencies were held up for criticism, with particular concern expressed about \nthe relatively low proportion of minority ethnic staff employed by the police \nservice. In the subsequent Home Secretary\u2019s Action Plan (1999), there was an \nexplicit managerialist focus on increasing the recruitment of minority ethnic staff \nto reflect local or national populations, with further targets set to improve the \nretention and progression of minority ethnic staff in the criminal justice services. \nThe assumption was that the police and other criminal justice services needed to \nbetter reflect their multi-ethnic and multi-cultural local communities. This would \nincrease their legitimacy and, with more minority ethnic officers, reduce \nstereotypical and biased behaviour against minority ethnic individuals2 (Home \nOffice 1999).  \nAlongside this there has been a mushrooming of minority professional \nassociations set up in response to the negative experiences of minority \npractitioners who have faced marginalisation, discrimination, and sometimes \nvictimisation in the police, crown prosecution, probation, and prison services3. \nThe National Black Police Association, the National Black Crown Prosecutors\u2019 \nAssociation, the Home Office Network and Respect (Her Majesty\u2019s Prison \nService) have all emerged in the last seven years, joining the longer established \nprofessional associations, such as the Metropolitan Police Service Black Police \nAssociation, the Society of Black Lawyers, the Association of Black Probation \nOfficers, and the Association of Asian Probation Staff , all of whom significantly \npredate the Lawrence Inquiry4. These professional associations provide support \nnetworks, mentoring, conferences, training, and social events for their members, \nand have had a central role in recruitment initiatives as the criminal justice services \nseek assistance in meeting the targets contained in the Home Secretary\u2019s Action \nPlan. For some of the minority professional associations, their mission extends \n 2\n beyond these internal activities to a concern with improving service delivery for \nminority ethnic individuals and communities as \u2018users\u2019 (victims, witnesses, \nsuspects, defendants and prisoners) of criminal justice services (see Phillips \nforthcoming).  \nAt first sight these organisations \u2013 most of whom have adopted \u2018black\u2019 in their \nname and membership criteria - appear to be signalling a re-emergence and \nheralding of the collective black political identity, formerly buried (at least \ntheoretically) in the early 1990s, but resurrected in the early 21st century to \nchallenge racism within the criminal justice professions. \nReflecting on Alexander (2002) who has charted the demise of the hegemony \nof the \u201cold\u201d black political project in favour of the \u201cnew\u201d politics of difference \nwithin the academy, this paper presents an empirical picture of an uncertain black \npolitical alliance in the form of black and minority professional associations in the \ncriminal justice field, six years on from the pivotal Macpherson Report (1999). \nWhilst many of the organisations included in this small-scale study rode on the \nwave of optimism engendered by the Lawrence Inquiry, the current political \nclimate is one in which the term \u2018institutional racism\u2019 has all but disappeared from \ngovernment policy statements. New Labour has seemingly misplaced its anti-racist \ncredentials - if it can ever be claimed that it had them - and now its objective is to \npromote race equality, a more liberal and less politically controversial policy goal. \nThe New Labour policy landscape is one in which the language of promoting race \nequality, championing diversity, and reducing social exclusion prevails.  \nThe research on which this paper draws is based on in-depth interviews with \nthe Chairs of the National Black Police Association, Metropolitan Black Police \nAssociation, National Association of Black Crown Prosecutors, Association of \nBlack Probation Officers, National Association of Asian Probation Staff5, the \n 3\n Home Office Network and Respect (Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Service), and two senior \nofficials working within the Home Office on race equality and diversity issues. \nAdditionally, data are included from a small case study of the Association of Black \nProbation Officers6, which entailed further interviews with five Executive \nCommittee members, and observation of a small number of regional and national \nmeetings, including the AGM in April 20047. The interviews were conducted \nbetween June 2003 and June 2004. Each interview was recorded and transcribed \nverbatim, then coded and analysed using QSR NUD*IST. In an attempt to \npreserve anonymity, the interview quotes used throughout this paper have not \nbeen individually attributed.  \nWhilst the experiences of these minority professional associations have \nundoubtedly been shaped by the politics of race in the post-Macpherson era, their \nstudy also presents an opportunity to revisit some of the ghosts of the 1980s; \nparticularly the politics of minority-led institutions and their efforts to influence \npolicy formation and service delivery. This article begins by considering the vexed \nissue of building a coalition around a black political identity before exploring the \ninherent challenges of fighting racism from within, as employees of criminal justice \nservices. It ends with an acknowledgement of the important role of black and \nminority professional associations in providing a supportive network for members \nwhose experiences of occupational racism are only subtly different in the post-\nMacpherson era compared with earlier periods.  \n \nBlack political mobilisation in the 2000s: same old, same old? \n \n\u2018\u2026it is not because of their skins that they are Black in their heads.\u2019 (Hall 2000:149) \n \n 4\n In the 1980s local and national political campaigns organised to challenge racism \nwere frequently mounted under a \u2018black\u2019 banner with those of diverse ethnic \norigins uniting against white oppression in Britain. Drawing on the symbolism of \nthe Black Power movement in the US, black became a signifier of collective \nresistance and a rallying cry to band together to oppose racial injustice (Bryan, \nDadzie and Scafe 1985; Anthias, Yuval-Davis and Cain 1992; Shukra 1998). \nHowever, despite claims to its hegemonic past, even during its heyday as a \ncollective political identity, the basis of blackness was questioned (Housee and \nSharma 1999). Among activists it was frequently the subject of rigorous debate as \nto who was \u2018black enough\u2019 to be included by the term (see for example Anthias \nand Yuval-Davis 1992; Hensman 19958).  \nChallenges to the validity of a black political alliance were most \nvociferously voiced by Modood (1988, 1994) who vehemently rejected the term \n\u2018black\u2019 as an essentialist construct, claiming that its use was coercive and harmful to \n\u2018Asians\u2019 (Modood 1988: 403). His argument rested on an assumption that \nblackness operated largely as a descriptive rather than a political device. For it to \nfunction in the latter sense, according to Modood, it required a neutrality which it \nsimply did not possess; a positive black identity was almost exclusively rooted in \nAfrican but not South Asian heritages. For Asians to consider themselves as black \nrequired them to \u201cadopt an identity false to their own being\u201d, which would militate \nagainst their engaging in meaningful political struggle (Modood 1988: 402).  Thus, \nthose of South Asian origin could only ever become \u201csecondary or ambiguous \nblacks\u201d who effectively had to accept the leadership of those of African heritage in \nany political campaign (Modood 1988: 399). Modood\u2019s work does recognise the \nvalue of unity against white racism but he rails against what he views as race \nrelations professionals\u2019 failure to respect ethnic self-definition which would \n 5\n privilege Asian cultural traditions9.  \nAt the heart of Modood\u2019s position is the impossibility of a unified political \nformation among those of Asian, African and African-Caribbean origins when \nSouth Asians do not view themselves as black, even if there is a recognition of \nsome commonalities of experience of white racism. His alternative formulation \nwhich seeks to elevate \u2018Asianess\u2019, however, has been subject to critique by Housee \nand Sharma (1999) for its similarly essentialising tendencies which may act to \nsilence other subjectivities. Brah (1996) too challenges Modood\u2019s (1988) view that \nblackness is an essentialist construct, but rather sees it as a historically situated \nstrategy which, in post-war Britain, was organised around the politics of racism \nrather than cultural difference. Nonetheless, Modood\u2019s claims have received some \nempirical support in Sudbury (2001)study of black women\u2019s organisations in \nBritain. Hall\u2019s (2000) work too has expressed concern about the silencing of Asian \nvoices and forms of resistance centred on language, cultural traditions, historical \nbackground, gender and class. \nIn the parallel universe of the academy, anti-essentialism and the \n\u2018fetishization of marginality\u2019 (Alexander 2002: 566) has been upheld through the \npolitics of difference, with identity coming to be seen as fragmented, fluid, under \nconstruction, thus jettisoning the reification of homogenised racial and ethnic \nidentities. Undoubtedly there are some attractive strands to this analysis, but in the \ncold light of empirical (as opposed to socially constructed) reality10, structural \ndiscrimination and exclusion continue to operate in the lives of marginalized \ngroups buttressed by social and historical processes of colonialism and oppression \n(Bhattacharyya, Gabriel and Small 2002; Mac an Ghaill 1999; Sharma, Hutnyk and \nSharma 1996). Quick to draw our attention to these theoretical blind-spots have \nbeen minority scholars, particularly feminists. They have warned against the \n 6\n potential of the postmodernist turn to obscure and suppress subaltern voices and \ntheir claims to truth, authenticity and authority, with the resultant effect of \nderailing political activism at the collective level. This has led Hill Collins (1998: \n136), for example, to ask the pertinent question, \u2018When weapons of resistance are \ntheorized away in this fashion, one might ask, who really benefits?\u2019 The response \nto this rhetorical question is academics of the postmodernist persuasion whose \nnotion of difference preclude achieving community in any political sense. Spivak\u2019s \n(1988) concept of strategic essentialism offers a get-out or half-way position \nwhereby subaltern11 consciousness is actively used for political even militant \nchange (see also Jhappan 1996) solution of contextual essentialism)12. \nEssentialisms, according to Spivak (1990: 51) act not as descriptors, but \u201cas \nsomething that one must adopt to produce a critique of anything\u201d. These \ntheoretical concerns are mirrored in the policy context as minority professional \nassociations in the criminal justice services consider how best to organise politically \nas a racialized collectivity in order to resist occupational racism.  \n \nRace\/colour: a marker for inclusion and exclusion? \nIn the current research, with the exception of the National Association of Asian \nProbation Staff, the naming of the professional association and establishment of its \nmembership criteria had been a fraught exercise and the subject of painful and \nprolonged debate. Only the Home Office Network (formerly Ethnic Minority \nNetwork) and the prison service\u2019s professional association (Respect) had decided \nagainst a term which included a politicised racial or ethnic referent.  \nThe other professional associations whose members came from the police, \ncrown prosecution, and probation services had all adopted the black platform as \ntheir preferred organising strategy. The exclusionary potential of black (particularly \n 7\n for those of Asian heritage) was weighed against the appeal of a term which could \nstand on its own and be recognised as a powerful political force. The use of black \nas a political category was grounded in an oppositional stance against historical and \ncontemporary forms of racism within criminal justice institutions and wider \nsociety. These were regarded as simultaneously affecting black and Asian \nprofessionals. However, many interviewees\u2019 comments revealed that either \nexplicitly or implicitly they were primarily referring to racialized forms of \ndiscrimination as justification for the use of the term black. This is demonstrated in \nthe following two quotes by interviewees of African and African-Caribbean origin \nrespectively who in their interviews readily acknowledged the problems associated \nwith the term black: \n \n\u2026within the black groups you will have ethnicity, we are one \nrace but we have different ethnic groupings within us\u2026Well \nblack is a colour. We are talking colour here. That is where the \ndistinction is drawn really.     \n \n \nwe have never said Asian people have the same needs as us, \nwhat we have said is we all, because of where we come from                                                      \nand the colour of our skin, suffer racism. And that for us is the \nmain focus\u2026we can look at our differences, celebrate them, and \nwork together in that sense. But in terms of working with the \nestablishment i.e. the criminal justice system we felt that was the  \nplatform to hang things on\u2026 I just think that Europeans are \nvery good at that whole divide and rule. And I think as Africans \n 8\n and Asians we know this but we still allow them to get away \nwith it.    \n \nThe extreme racist standard or what was labelled by one interviewee as the \n\u2018Combat 18 criteria\u2019 \u2013 \u2018At the end of the day people don't think today I am going \nto throw a brick at somebody who looks African-Caribbean but not at somebody \nwho is Asian\u2019 - was also cited as the basis for deciding membership. This assumed \na crude black\/white dualism in which black constituted every ethnic heritage which \nthrough visual identification could not be claimed as white, Northern European. \nUnity, at least against racism, was assumed among all \u2018other than white\u2019 individuals, \nregardless of the diversity of individuals who might constitute the membership. At \none level, of course, this position accepts that racism in society may be absolute \nand without regard to ethnic, cultural and regional variations. For Modood (1988: \n397-8), however, this position is untenable since: \n \nIf anti-racists borrow the racists\u2019 classifications in order to \ndefeat racism\u2026 then however successful or not they may be as \nan interest group they will have lost\u2026the ideal of a multi-racial \nsociety for a model of society as composed of two and only two \n\u2018races\u2019 which for the foreseeable future must live in conflict. \n \nAnother variant of the race\/colour stance was visibility of difference. This \nwas the deciding factor for full membership of professional associations which \ncould admit those of Middle Eastern or Chinese origin, whilst denying full \nmembership to those of Irish or Eastern European origin who might claim similar \ndiscrimination on the basis of their ethnicity rather than race:  \n 9\n for example an Irish person in the history when they said \u2018No \nBlacks, No Dogs, No Irish\u2019. It wasn't because they were \nbeing discriminated because of their colour it was because of \ntheir ethnicity and I think that that is the difference. You know \nwe can't hide our difference\u2026 \n \nSometimes people say 'why can't other white people who are \nnon-English attend?' I say it is not a question of language, it is a \nquestion that you see me, I am different, I am physically \ndifferent from you. Unless Eastern European opens their mouth \nand they have got an accent, that is the only time that you know \nthat they are not English\u2026Otherwise you assume because they \nmirror your image.  \n \nChanging times: the political currency of \u2018Black and Asian\u2019 \nThe detractors to the use of black in the name and membership criteria of \nprofessional associations were not only those representatives from the National \nAssociation of Asian Probation Staff. More broadly there was a recognition of \n\u2018changing times\u2019, heightened in policy circles through the Census\u2019 identification of \nthe \u2018mixed race\u2019 group, the influx of Eastern European migrants, and the \ngroundswell of public and political antipathy towards asylum seekers and refugees. \nComments such as \u2018it no longer holds as well as it did\u2019, \u2018I think that it is a term \nthat\u2026we are going to have to debate again and again and again \u2026\u2019,  \u2018\u2026do we \nreally need to use that term, is it really relevant\u2026?\u2019 were relatively commonplace \namong interviewees.  \n \n 10\n Accounts by some South Asian interviewees echoed the claims of Modood \n(1988, 1994) in their views of a collective black political identity (see also Sudbury \n2001). This was particularly so in relation to not identifying with the term because \nof its implicit link to African and Caribbean heritages. As one interviewee of \nIndian origin opined, \u2018...black \u2026.it means something totally different in Asian \nlanguages. And unless you speak and know them and have that cultural identity \nyou cannot understand the impact of using the term black\u2026.\u2019.  \nThe desire to establish a specifically Asian professional association in addition \nto the Association of Black Probation Officers was also prompted by what was \nregarded as the probation service\u2019s \u2018anti-Asian\u2019 history of ethnic monitoring which \nused a White\/Black\/Other categorisation for many years:  \n \nIf I say that I am Asian and I read out the political definition of \nblack, I am still with you\u2026 We want the same thing which is \nrace equality. I don't have to turn myself black to be with you. I \njust want to have my own association. Because in the probation \nservice\u2026 Asians don't exist\u2026. you were black, white or other. \n \nIt was a lack of Asian perspective in the work of the Probation  \nService\u2026for example the service delivery side but also because \nthere was an under-representation of Asian staff. Staff that were \naround felt very isolated, very marginalized between the \ndichotomy of black and white on the one hand and them trying \nto struggle to keep their own identity on the other. And I think \nit was out of that kind of sense of frustration that they felt that \nthey needed to do something. That they needed to form a \n 11\n support group that would identify with their needs as Asian \npeople working within the probation service.                          \nIt was also felt that the focus on black had prevented discussion of the significant \nunder-representation of Asian staff in the probation service, in contrast to the \nmore proportionate representation of African-Caribbean staff, albeit in more \njunior grades: \u2018We actually formed our association because we thought that the \nblack term didn't identify, it marginalised us. The fact that there was only 1% of us \naround, and nobody said a word.\u2019 Quantitatively the research was unable to gauge \nthe extent to which the use of the term black did prevent some minority ethnic \nprofessionals from joining their respective professional associations. Precisely \nbecause of the definition of black enshrined in the Association of Black Probation \nOfficers\u2019 constitution, for example, figures were not held on the ethnicity of its \nmembership.  \nIn rejecting the black\/white dichotomy as a form of extinguishing Asian \nperspectives, another former Chair critiqued the black position for its failure to \nunderstand the complexities of Asian groups along the lines of geography, religion, \nlanguage and culture. It is this fault line that Alexander (2002) identifies as creating \ndivisions between minority groups and playing into the hands of those who claim \ncultural inadequacies explain disadvantage and marginalisation (see also Sivanandan \n2000). Brah (1996) too rejects \u2018ethnicist\u2019 discourses which privilege cultural needs \nover the social relations of power, at the same time as promoting a mistaken \nhomogeneity of common cultural needs and difference. However, like Modood \n(1994), some Asian interviewees pointed to the importance of cultural practices in \nrelation to dress, dietary habits, and non-Christian religious observance in \ncontributing to discrimination. This prioritising of cultural (as well as racialized) \ndiscrimination stood in direct contrast to the findings of Holdaway and O'Neill \n 12\n forthcoming) in their study of black police associations. In the police service, \nreligious beliefs and cultural needs such as diet were of secondary importance to \noccupational racism, although the expansion of faith-based and ethnicity-based \nstaff associations within some police services, notably the Metropolitan Police \nService, significantly qualifies this finding. The establishment of Christian, Jewish, \nMuslim, Sikh, Chinese and South East Asian, and Turkish and Turkish Cypriot \npolice staff support associations in the Metropolitan Police Service, for example, \npoints to the increasing significance of faith and ethnicity as identity markers and \nbases for employment-based political representation.  \nRather inevitably the establishment of separate (politically) black and Asian \nprofessional associations to represent probation staff had been the source of some \nconflict, although the current Chairs were sanguine about their differences of \nopinion and were committed to working together for race equality in the probation \nservice. The \u2018Asian issue\u2019 within the Association of Black Probation Officers \nremained a live one, however, brought to the fore at the AGM in April 2004, with \none delegate forcefully requesting more of an Asian perspective to ABPO work in \nthe future. Despite this, Asian members appeared to contribute fully to conference \ndiscussions. Indeed, one of the most moving speeches of the conference was by an \nAsian probation officer who castigated those individuals who sought to use \u2018the \nAsian issue\u2019 to hijack the business and potential progress of the Association of \nBlack Probation Officers. Moreover, in recent years Asian probation officers had \nheld important Executive Committee positions within the Association of Black \nProbation Officers. An estimate of representation at the AGM did indicate a \nsmaller proportion of Asian conference delegates compared to those of African \nand African-Caribbean heritages. This would be expected to some extent because \nof their lower comparative representation in the probation staff population (Home \n 13\n Office 2004. This probably explained some Caribbean-toned addresses to \nconference delegates and occasional Christian references. Without interviewing \nAsian participants it is impossible to assess whether these instances were regarded \nas exclusionary in any way or simply reflecting the cultures of the majority of \nattendees.  \nTaken together, these accounts clearly reveal that the concept of political \nblackness is still a somewhat contested and fragile notion, but nonetheless one that \npersists (see also Housee and Sharma 1999; Sudbury 2001). Blackness operates to \nsignify a common unity which is perceived to exist among quite disparate groups, \nsometimes even those categorised as white but subjected to discrimination along \nthe lines of ethnicity, language, religion or some other cultural symbol. It endures \nas a political signifier in large part because there is not a viable alternative for \nmarginalized groups who wish to collectively resist racism. Indeed, for a small \nnumber of interviewees the use of the term black was purely pragmatic or occurred \nby default. This, from an interviewee who referred to himself as a black man of \nIndian origin: \n \nSo you had this term 'Black and Asian' but when you took  \nblack....black is not a geographic term, whereas Asian is \ngeographic. Doesn't make sense. So we looked at it and you                                                        \ncould have a name of everybody's countries where people come \nfrom but of course you would have a very lengthy name \n[laughs]. But what we were looking at was the common and \nshared experiences of people of colour. And the best definition \nthat we could come up with which was all-encompassing was \nblack\u2026. As long as it is a description of experience rather than \n 14\n colour it was easier for us to deal with.  \n \nThe most descriptive option, given their relative numerical dominance \namong the minority population in Britain, and following alphabetical convention \n(Modood 1994) would be to name these professional associations as \u2018Asian and \nBlack\u2019. However, whilst this may reflect the contemporary (and official) labels \nattached to these internally diverse groups, it has the drawback of excluding other \nminorities by being even more specific. It also dissociates itself from a discourse of \nactive resistance and an oppositional solidarity borne out of the emotive language \nand imagery of the Black Power movement and its connection with civil rights \nadvances in the US. It might even be argued that the symbolic character of \nblackness remains even more important at a time when New Labour policy \ndiscourses have (at least until recently) stridently promoted the elimination of \ninstitutional racism, a term which itself came into being during the Black Power \nmovement (Carmichael and Hamilton 1968). At the height of the Lawrence \nInquiry the concept of institutional racism captured the political and public \nimagination. It has subsequently been replaced with the softer language of \u2018race \nequality\u2019 (of opportunity but not outcome) and \u2018diversity\u2019 (see for example Home \nOffice 2005). Just as the academy has espoused notions of \u2018difference\u2019, the policy \narena has adopted \u2018diversity\u2019 as its mantra. The race equality and diversity agendas \ncoalesce in the employment field, framed by a celebration of cultural differences, \nand the value of allowing individuals to reach their true potential - which has \nbenefits for employers too13. As such, these represent more politically palatable \ngoals than the elimination of institutional racism. The diversity agenda is implicitly \nlinked to disadvantage and discrimination, particularly on the grounds of race and \ngender, but with sexuality, disability (and increasingly, faith) usually added to the \n 15\n mix. At one level this is a welcome acknowledgement of the multifarious forms of \ndiscrimination which pervade public sector workplaces and which operate to \noppress various marginalized groups. However, diversity like difference, can serve \nto obscure structural inequalities and inspire depoliticized multiculturalist \nresponses of the \u2018saris, samosas and steel-band\u2019 variety (Donald and Rattansi 1992; \nAlexander 2002; see also Wrench 2005 for a fuller critique of the concept of \ndiversity). Wrench (2005) considers the possibility that employers may adopt the \n\u2018soft option\u2019: promoting \u2018intercultural awareness\u2019 whilst avoiding employing a more \nrepresentative workforce or undertaking anti-discrimination training. A sign of this \nblurring of equality and diversity can be seen in the most recent Home Office \n(2005) strategy document on race equality and community cohesion, where \nreferences to racism are made solely in relation to racially motivated offenders and \ncommunity extremists with no mention of racism within state institutions \u2013 a far \ncry from the Macpherson Report\u2019s (1999) understanding of institutional racism. It \nmay be argued then, that this subtle but meaningful shift in discourse necessitates a \nstrategic essentialism, to use Spivak\u2019s term, simply to ensure that racism remains on \nthe political agenda14. Thus to avoid the political diminution of race under the \numbrella of diversity means a reliance on the term \u2018black\u2019 not least because of its \ncrude biological connotation.  \n \nBiting the hand that feeds: \u2018critical friend\u2019 or the management of criticism?  \n \nThere is a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu engendered from the above discussion of a black \npolitical identity and this is similarly invoked around the question of accountability. \nIn the context of the current research this concerned financial accountability and \nthe politics of funding. As was the case with many community-focused \n 16\n organisations operating in the 1980 and 1990s, the minority professional \nassociations in the criminal justice field have had to decide whether to opt for the \ninsecurity but independence of charitable funding or receive more stable state \nfunding with the danger of political strings attached. Given the continued focus of \ngovernment on the employment of minorities in the criminal justice professions \n(enshrined in the Home Secretary\u2019s Action Plan (1999) and annual monitoring \nreports), it might be argued that direct funding of minority professional \nassociations reflects a new openness by government to listen to accounts of \noccupational racism, and with this, a commitment to promote organisational \nchange. A critical analysis would suggest a more disingenuous motive whereby \nholding the purse strings enables the state to co-opt critical voices and manage \ndissent (Gilroy 1987). In this study, it was evident that there was some cynicism \nabout the motives of the criminal justice services\u2019 funding of professional \nassociations who might publicly challenge their practices. A common perception \nwas that funding had come about because of mounting pressure at the time of the \nMacpherson Report (1999), with services recognising the need to \u2018get their own \nhouse in order\u2019 before focusing externally on service delivery: \nI don't think that that has been out of choice. I think it has been \nmore out of necessity and the desire to demonstrate that they \nare doing something in relation to the Lawrence report and so \nforth. I think it is about, well we need to do it\u2026 we are going to \nbe judged on it, and if we don't do it we are going to look silly\u2026 \n \nThe dilemma of state funding was one that the minority professional \nassociations in the current study were acutely attuned to. The danger of becoming \na \u2018management tool\u2019 was the subject of continuous and sometimes heated debate \n 17\n as the following extracts demonstrate: \n \nwe have had ex number of arguments at AGM about whether \nwe should take funding\u2026 whether that means we are taking the \nKing's shilling... And in some ways it does mean that and it does \nresult in a diminishing of what you can do. How you can say it. \n\u2026You can begin to rely on it. And although the amount we \nget\u2026 is small... nevertheless it is now enough that if it were \ntaken away we would be struggling... \n \nAnd we are forced into thinking do we follow them and do as \nthey bid so to speak \u2026 or do we go back for our \ninterdependence which we risk going back to being a grass roots \norganisation meeting at people's houses on a Saturday and \nSunday in the evenings, that is the risk\u2026 I think we are \nvulnerable to the whims of policy changes, ministers, and  \nwhat the [service] does. So we are at a critical point as an \norganisation in terms of what we do next.                                                                   \nThe term \u2018critical friend\u2019 was used by one interviewee to describe the role of \nminority professional associations, with interviewees tending to claim that they \nwere able to maintain a critical distance from their employers and funders. \nHowever, there was an acceptance that their style of working might be less \nconfrontational leading them to seek redress internally first, because of the funding \narrangements. A particular restriction on associations was the requirement to \nadhere to various bureaucratic procedures. This was seen as detracting from the \nneeds of members and wider black communities. To give an example, in the case \n 18\n of one professional association, conference costs had been met in full by a criminal \njustice service but because of complex procurement arrangements this prevented \nthe use of a black community centre as a venue. A disproportionately heavy focus \non meeting the national objectives in the service\u2019s business plan was also regarded \nas another way of stifling independence and dictating association\u2019s work agenda \nwith priorities set which might not correspond with members\u2019 priorities.  \nAt the time of the research, however, there was little evidence of the \nincorporation of critical voices. The media profile of some minority professional \nassociations indicate that a critical perspective is more than possible within the \nconstraints of internal funding and employment. The Metropolitan Black Police \nAssociation, for example, has continuously sought national publicity around cases \nof discriminatory employment practice. Likewise, the National Black Police \nAssociation recently threatened to withdraw from positive action initiatives to \nrecruit more minority ethnic officers because of continuing racism and \ndiscrimination in the police service. Such efforts do not support the view that state \nfunding prohibits independent lobbying with these examples promising maximum \nembarrassment for the New Labour agenda around race equality in criminal justice \nemployment. \nIn rejecting the simplification of the co-optation of funded community \norganisations by the state, Sudbury\u2019s (2001) study of black women\u2019s organisations \nindicates the need for a more nuanced understanding which recognises the greater \nreach of funded community organisations and their creative ability to forward their \nown political agendas regardless of their paymasters. That said, some of her \ninterviewees as well as some of those in the current study were more inclined to be \nhighly dismissive of state funding and instead hankered after greater autonomy and \na more critical edge to their work: \n 19\n You are better off having no funding as I said, because you lead                                                  \nan agenda, you can say what you want. As soon as you fall into \ngovernment you stop playing ball in the park and you don't let \nthat ball go out because you might lose funding. You keep it in. \nAnd it keeps some people in post and in power.  \nWhere additional independent funding had been secured, for example by the \nMetropolitan Black Police Association, there was a feeling that this increased the \nextent to which the association was accountable to its members and also galvanised \nmembers into demonstrating a more active political commitment. \nThe political constraints brought about by state funding was also \nacknowledged by one of the senior officials interviewed for the research. However, \nin their view it was the former interpretation of open government and freedom to \ncriticise which determined the nature of the funding relationship: \n \nI have tried to steer this organisation on the path where we do \nnot compromise on the freedom of our staff associations. They \nare responsible for their conferences. They determine who they \nwant to address them. They can say whatever they feel needs to \nbe said... I see a strength of staff association in their ability to be  \nable at any time to provide that critical feedback. One that is \nuncomfortable. If it needs to be but I would wish for... \nconstructive dialogue\u2026. constructive criticism and always try to \nfind ways of working together. \nFunding professional associations was seen as a means of strategically enabling \nmarginalised groups to become \u2018part of the business\u2019, to have a place at decision-\nmaking tables, primarily in relation to internal employment practices but also \n 20\n extending externally into service delivery for minority \u2018users\u2019 of criminal justice \nservices. At the same time this view was tempered by concerns about the way in \nwhich professional associations used their funding, particularly since activities had \nto be accounted for and linked to specific national objectives, such as an increase \nin minority retention or a reduction in crime or offending behaviour. \nThe familiar scramble for scarce resources was becoming increasingly evident \nas some minority professional associations perceived competition with each other \nor emerging networks focused on disability and sexuality in the criminal justice \nservices. In the current research this played out in the probation service with the \nstate-funded Association of Black Probation Officers and the National Association \nof Asian Probation Staff questioning the extent of funding given to each \nprofessional association. A similar picture has been described by Anthias and \nYuval-Davis (1992) in their study of the politics of race and racism in a London \nborough in the late 1980s. Sivanandan (2000: 422) has lamented what he sees as \nthese deep forms of cultural segmentation which have followed on from \nmulticulturalist policies, transforming resistance from a collective (politically black) \nsite to an individual (black or Asian) one where individuals compete \u2018over position \nand power and a place under the ethnic sun\u2019.  \nThe issue of political influence and power is a thorny one. Previous research \non anti-racist political struggles points to them occurring at the margins of the \nlocal political machinery (Ben-Tovim et al. 1986). It was not really possible for this \nsmall-scale study to gauge the political influence of the minority professional \nassociations in informing policy formation and service delivery, particularly as \nsome are fledgling organisations. However, among the longer established \nassociations and those with more generous funding, there was certainly a \nperception that their status had been enhanced in the post-Macpherson era, that \n 21\n they were now routinely invited and represented at the key decision-making fora in \neach service. In the probation service, for example, this extended to representation \non the main strategy committee and a variety of service delivery committees. Both \nthe Association of Black Probation Officers and the National Association of Asian \nProbation Staff had played an important role as advisory group members for the \nthematic inspection on race equality work, covering both employment practice and \nwork with minority ethnic offenders and racially motivated offenders (Her \nMajesty's Inspectorate of Probation 2000, 2004). Similarly, it seems likely that the \nadverse publicity garnered by the Metropolitan and National Black Police \nAssociations concerning discriminatory employment practices in the police service \nwas instrumental in the setting up of the Morris Inquiry (2004) into complaints and \ngrievance procedures. These professional associations have also typically had an \ninput into local and national race equality schemes and diversity strategies (see also \nPhillips forthcoming). Lobbying on service delivery issues was inevitably more \ndifficult for the professional associations representing civil service and agency staff \nbased directly within the Home Office and the Prison Service, and there \nemployment issues remained the sole focus. \n 22\n The limits to political influence were partially explained by the infrastructure of \nthe minority professional associations representing criminal justice professionals. \nThey typically operate with only a full-time or part-time administrator. \nChairpersons and Executive Committee members\u2019 time \u2013 varying from three to \nthirteen days a month would be \u2018bought out\u2019 from local services by the national \npolice, crown prosecution, and probation services15. Interviewees frequently \nreported, however, that their minority professional association work extended way \nbeyond the funded time per month or that line managers had not reduced their \nworkloads to take account of their professional association work, and on occasion, \nthat operational expediency (or the excuse of) meant that they were unable to \nattend key professional association meetings. \nNonetheless, despite the limits to minority professional associations\u2019 political \ninfluence and ongoing disputes over political blackness, the emotional significance \nattached to their internal function, that of providing support, was striking. The \nprimacy of the support function was proof of the continuity of occupational \nracism in the criminal justice services. This is discussed extensively elsewhere \n(Phillips forthcoming), but it is important to note that interviewees continued to \nperceive employment within the criminal justice services as an isolating and hostile \nworking environment for some minority ethnic members of staff. For this reason, \nprofessional association meetings provided a safe space for members to discuss \ntheir feelings about their occupational experiences. Support slots at each meeting \nallowed members to seek emotional support, advice or advocacy regarding \nincidents of discrimination or concerns about career development. The nature of \nthis should not be underestimated as the following quotes reveal: \n \n \n 23\n We sit and discuss personal problems and think actually it is not  \njust you that feels like that. I also feel like that. But the biggest \nsupport I have discovered after speaking to staff is seeing each \nother. Speaking to each other. It just reassures them. \n \nI knew if I was ever feeling low, depressed, I could always pick \nup the phone and there was someone there that I could talk to, \nwho could understand what I was going through. Because \nsometimes when you are in an office on your own, and whether \nwe like it or not, there is things that go on, it is not always overt \nracism, covert racism goes on. And sometimes you feel 'am I \ngoing mad?' and you know because we go through that\u2026 we  \nhave been through that syndrome before\u2026 all sorts of things \ngoing wrong. It sort of has a negative effect on you. You can \nthink that you are paranoid, until you pick the phone up and \nspeak to someone from [black professional association].  \n \nConclusion \nIn the post-Macpherson era it cannot be argued that race is no longer on the \npolitical agenda. The racialization of the current political flavours of the moment \u2013 \nasylum and immigration, terrorism control, \u2018mugging\u2019 and \u2018community cohesion\u2019 \nare juxtaposed with New Labour\u2019s earlier commitment to eliminate institutional \nracism in the wake of the Lawrence Inquiry (see also Bourne 2001). In the criminal \njustice field, the Macpherson Report (1999) opened up a space for minority \nprofessional associations to publicly resist discriminatory employment practices \nfrom within the criminal justice services. The platform that the reform agenda \n 24\n provided for minority professionals to speak out about their experiences of \noccupational racism is one primarily founded on a contested notion of political \nblackness. The re-emergence of the \u2018black spectre\u2019 is testimony to its enduring \nappeal but its contemporary manifestation displays all the familiar hallmarks and \ntensions of inclusion\/exclusion that ultimately led to its earlier downfall among \npolitical activists and academics alike. The establishment of new ethnicity- and \nfaith-based staff support associations further reinforces this view. It remains to be \nseen whether its comeback \u2013 like that of institutional racism \u2013 is short-lived.  \nIt might be argued, somewhat paradoxically, that it is this privileging of the \ndiversity agenda which marks the most significant nail in the coffin to the political \nagendas of minority professional associations. Presenting the dual dangers of \nreducing financial support amidst the call for the resourcing of other \ndiscriminated-against staff groups, as well as obscuring the structural elements of \nracism in favour of multiculturalist difference, the ideology of \u2018diversity\u2019 threatens \nto undermine the political dimension of their work. However, providing the \nsupportive function of minority professional associations\u2019 work is maintained this \nmay not matter. The seemingly continuous uncovering of vestiges of racism in the \ncriminal justice services evidenced by, for example, Her Majesty\u2019s Prison Service\u2019s \nfailure to prevent the racist murder of an Asian prisoner by his cellmate, the \nfindings of the BBC Secret Policeman documentary which unearthed blatant and \nextreme racism among trainee constables, and the collapse of the inappropriate \ndisciplinary case against senior police officer Ali Dizaei and other minority officers, \ndemonstrates that this work is becoming no less vital. \n \n 25\n Acknowledgements \n \nThe research reported here was supported by grants from the Nuffield Foundation \nand the London School of Economics and Political Science Suntory and Toyota \nInternational Centres for Economics and Related Disciplines.

In March 2005, the National \nCoalition of Black-Led Organisations (NCBLO) was launched with representatives from many \ngovernment departments and some private companies. \u2018Black\u2019 refers to those from African, African \nCaribbean and Asian and other visible minority ethnic communities who may face racism. \n4 The Metropolitan Police Service Black Police Association formally launched in 1997, but a smaller \ngrouping of officers had met informally since the Bristol Seminars of 1990 (see Holdaway and \nO\u2019Neill 2004). \n5 A former Chairperson was also interviewed. \n6 This professional association, founded in 1984 obviously predates the Lawrence Inquiry (1999). It \nwas selected because it is one of the longest established of all the minority professional associations, \nand because of its internal (supporting black probation officers) and external (promoting anti-\ndiscriminatory service delivery) focus. \n7 There was also some documentary analysis of ABPO materials (e.g. constitution, minutes of \nmeetings, AGM papers, business plans, etc.). \n8 Hensman (1995) cites the Black Lesbian and Gay project which established that black applied to \nthose with one or both parents from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, China and the Pacific Nations, \nLatin America, indigenous peoples in Australasia, North America and the Atlantic and Indian ocean \nislands. \n9 Housee and Sharma\u2019s (1999) critique of Modood centres on his failure to distinguish between \npolitical campaigning by grassroots black organisations and the language used by anti-racist local \nauthorities (see also Brah 1996).  \n 32\n                                                                                                                                   \n10 The Economic and Social Research Council is currently funding a \u00a34m Identities and Social Action \nresearch programme in recognition that \u2018much public debate and recent social theory is based on \nuntested claims about the changing nature of identity in modern and post-modern societies\u2019 \n(http:\/\/www.identities.org.uk\/). \n11 Here Spivak is referring to those who do not have access to social mobility within colonized \ncountries. \n12 Housee and Sharma (1999) also consider the possibility of syncretic hybridity as a an alternative \nfor political solidarity in the new forms of British culture, Nonetheless, this may not simply result in \nan emancipatory orientation.  \n13 See Wrench (2005) for a critique of action taken only on business grounds rather than the moral \nimperative of equality, fairness and justice. \n14 In 2003, Doreen Lawrence claimed that race was no longer a central pillar of the \ngovernment\u2019s equalities agenda . \n15 The main exception to this was the Home Office and Prison Service minority professional \nassociations. The Network has a full-time co-ordinator and administrative support. Respect has \nbeen able to negotiate five full-time members of staff with 96 regional staff having one day a week \nfor professional association work. \n 33\n"}
