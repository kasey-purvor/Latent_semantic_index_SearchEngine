Introduction\n[2] There are two major types of geomagnetic storms:\ncoronal mass ejection (CME)\u2010driven storms and corotating\ninteraction (CIR)\u2010driven storms. Because an important\nportion of the storms associated with a CIR is directly driven\nby the high\u2010speed solar wind that follows in time the CIR,\nCIR\u2010driven storms are also known as high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms. Also, the CIR itself is created by the action of\nthe high\u2010speed stream pushing into slower wind, as a CME\nsheath is created by the action of a fast CME moving into\nslower wind. The CIR, like the CME sheath [cf. Gosling\net al., 1991; Tsurutani and Gonzalez, 1997; Y. I. Yermolaev\net al., Specific interplanetary conditions for CIR\u2010, sheath\u2010,\nand ICME\u2010induced geomagnetic storms obtained by double\nsuperposed\u2010epoch analysis, submitted to Advances in Space\nResearch, 2010], can drive specific storm phenomena. In\nCME\u2010driven storms and CIR\u2010driven storms, various solar\nwind features can be associated with storm driving [cf.\nTsurutani et al., 1988, 1995].\n[3] High\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms are long\u2010duration\nactivations of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere\u2010ionosphere system.\nHigh\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms (1) can produce super-\ndense, extra hot plasma sheets that can cause anomalously\nhigh spacecraft charging in the magnetosphere [Borovsky\net al., 1998a; Denton et al., 2006; Denton and Borovsky,\n2009], (2) can produce high fluxes of relativistic electrons\nin the outer electron radiation belt that can lead to dangerous\nspacecraft internal charging in the magnetosphere [Paulikas\nand Blake, 1976; Belian et al., 1996; Reeves, 1998; Wrenn\nand Sims, 1996; Love et al., 2000], and (3) can produce\nlong\u2010duration ionospheric disturbances [e.g., Abdu et al.,\n2006; Pr\u00f6lss, 2006; Denton et al., 2009a; Chang et al.,\n2009; Sojka et al., 2009]. Unlike CME\u2010driven storms,\nhigh\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms produce only weak Dst\nperturbations [Yermolaev and Yermolaev, 2002; Denton\n1Space Science and Applications, Los Alamos National Laboratory,\nLos Alamos, New Mexico, USA.\n2Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JA015116\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, A08217, doi:10.1029\/2009JA015116, 2010\nA08217 1 of 35\net al., 2006; Turner et al., 2006, 2009; Borovsky and\nDenton, 2006]; since most storm catalogs are based on the\nsize of the Dst perturbation, high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms\nare often uncataloged and as a consequence less well studied\nthan are CME\u2010driven storms. This has been referred to as the\n\u201cDst mistake\u201d [Denton et al., 2009b].\n[4] It is important to study the two types of storms\nseparately: CME\u2010driven storms and high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms [Denton et al., 2006; see also Vasyliunas,\n2004; Siscoe and Siebert, 2006]. CME\u2010driven and high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms give rise to different phenomena\n[Denton et al., 2006; Borovsky and Denton, 2006]. One\nunderlying cause of the different behavior of the magneto-\nsphere in the two types of storms is the systematic difference\nin the Mach number of the solar wind, with CME\u2010driven\nstorms often occurring under low Mach number wherein the\nsolar wind\/magnetosphere coupling can drastically differ\nfrom the much more typical high Mach number conditions\n[Lavraud and Borovsky, 2008; Borovsky et al., 2009].\n[5] In this investigation, superposed\u2010epoch analysis will\nbe used. Because of the repeatable nature of high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms and their solar wind drivers, high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms are particularly amenable to\nsuperposed\u2010epoch analysis. Superposed\u2010epoch analysis of\nhigh\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms has been successful at\n(1) uncovering the systematic occurrence of the extra hot\nplasma sheet [Denton and Borovsky, 2009], (2) establishing\nthe several\u2010day lifetimes of plasmaspheric drainage plumes\n[Borovsky and Denton, 2008], (3) uncovering the role of the\nsuperdense plasma sheet in relativistic electron dropouts and\nrecoveries [Borovsky and Denton, 2009c], (4) determining\nthat compressed slow wind is the solar wind source of the\nsuperdense plasma sheet [Denton and Borovsky, 2009],\n(5) establishing that the stormtime energization of the outer\nelectron radiation belt is a slow heating at constant number\ndensity [Denton et al., 2009c], (6) quantifying hot\u2010plasma\ntransport time scales into and through the magnetosphere\nduring high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms [Denton and\nBorovsky, 2009], (7) quantifying the decay rate of the\nouter electron radiation belts during calms before storms\n[Borovsky and Denton, 2009b], and (8) quantifying the\ncold\u2010plasma mass flow in stormtime plasmaspheric drainage\nplumes [Borovsky and Denton, 2008]. Further, through the\nuse of superposed\u2010epoch analysis, several systematic dif-\nferences between CME\u2010driven and high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms have been catalogued [Denton et al., 2006].\n[6] In this report, the magnetic field morphology of the\nmagnetosphere for high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms is of\nconcern. There have been prior investigations of the storm-\ntime perturbations to the magnetic field at geosynchronous\norbit [e.g., Tsyganenko et al., 2003;Huang et al., 2006, 2008;\nOhtani et al., 2007], but those investigations did not differ-\nentiate between the different types of storms.\n1.1. Overview of High\u2010Speed Stream\u2010Driven Storms\n[7] High\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms arise when the Parker\nspiral\u2010oriented magnetic field in high\u2010speed streams is\nRussell\u2010McPherron effective [Crooker and Cliver, 1994;\nMursula and Zieger, 1996;McPherron and Weygand, 2006].\nUnder typical conditions in the declining phase of the solar\ncycle, the high\u2010speed wind can drive geomagnetic activity\nfor several days. Throughout the several days of geomag-\nnetic activity, large\u2010amplitude fluctuations of the interplan-\netary magnetic field in the high\u2010speed wind can be turning\nthe driving of the magnetosphere on and off on time scales\nof tens of minutes [Tsurutani et al., 1995, 1999;Denton et al.,\n2008; Borovsky and Denton, 2009a; Borovsky, 2010].\n[8] High\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms (unlike CME\u2010driven\nstorms) tend to be preceded by \u201ccalms before the storms\u201d\nthat precondition the magnetosphere for the oncoming storm\n[Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006]. The geomagnetic calms are\nthe result of slow wind upstream of sector reversals in the\nsolar wind being Russell\u2010McPherron noneffective (calm)\nif the fast wind behind the sector reversal is Russell\u2010\nMcPherron effective (storm). At 1 AU, the sector reversals\ntend to pass the Earth in the early portion of the CIR before\nthe stream interface passes. The calm before the storm leads\nto a build up of the outer plasmasphere that (1) produces a\ndecay in the number density of the outer electron radiation\nbelt in the days before the storm [Borovsky and Denton,\n2009b] and (2) leads to more robust plasmaspheric drain-\nage plumes during the storms [Borovsky and Denton, 2008].\n[9] During the early phase of a high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorm, a superdense plasma sheet may occur in the mag-\nnetosphere. The origin of this superdense plasma sheet is the\nhigher\u2010than\u2010average density of the compressed slow wind in\nthe CIR prior to the passage of the stream interface [Denton\nand Borovsky, 2009]. Also early in the storm a dropout of\nthe number density of the outer electron radiation belt may\noccur [Freeman, 1964; Nagai, 1988; Blake et al., 2001;\nOnsager et al., 2002; Green et al., 2004]. This dropout is\nlinked to the occurrence of a superdense plasma sheet\n[Borovsky and Denton, 2009c]: if there is no high\u2010density\nsolar wind, then there is no superdense plasma sheet in the\nmagnetosphere, and there will be no relativistic electron\ndropout of the outer electron radiation belt. About a half day\nafter the number density of the outer electron radiation belt\ndrops out, the number density suddenly recovers to a new\nvalue [Denton et al., 2009c] and that value stays fixed for\nseveral days thereafter. The sudden recovery of the outer\nelectron radiation belt density is linked to the termination of\nthe superdense plasma sheet phase of magnetospheric\nactivity.\n[10] In the late phase of the high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorm, the temperature of the outer electron radiation belt\nslowly increases at constant number density [Borovsky et al.,\n1998a; Denton et al., 2009c]. This modest temperature\nincrease leads to a great increase in the fluxes of energetic\nelectrons in the tail of the outer electron radiation belt dis-\ntribution function. These are the so\u2010called killer electrons that\npeak in flux several days into a high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorm [Nagai, 1988; Baker et al., 1990; Borovsky et al.,\n1998a].\n1.2. Outstanding Issues\n[11] There are several outstanding scientific issues con-\ncerning high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms [cf. Kavanagh and\nDenton, 2007; Denton et al., 2008]. One major topic is\nradiation belt evolution. A specific radiation belt evolution\nissue is the dropout and recovery of the outer electron radi-\nation belt and its temporal correspondence to the occurrence\nof the superdense plasma sheet. The dropout could be caused\n(1) by pitch angle scattering of radiation belt electrons into the\natmospheric loss cone by plasma waves [e.g., Thorne and\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n2 of 35\nKennel, 1971; Horne and Thorne, 1998; Summers and\nThorne, 2003; Sandanger et al., 2007] or (2) by drift losses\nto the magnetopause owing to distortion of the magnetosphere\n[e.g.,West et al., 1972; Li et al., 1997; Desorgher et al., 2000;\nBortnik et al., 2006; Ohtani et al., 2009]. The superdense\nplasma sheet could cause either scenario (1) or (2): with its\nhigher\u2010than\u2010normal thermal energy, the superdense plasma\nsheet could drive electromagnetic plasma waves that do the\npitch angle scattering [e.g., Borovsky and Denton, 2009c;\nDenton and Borovsky, 2009], or with its higher\u2010than\u2010normal\nplasma pressure, the plasma sheet could produce an extra\nstrong distortion of the nightside magnetosphere [e.g.,\nBorovsky et al., 1998a, Figure 18].\n[12] To understand the cause of the dropouts and recovery\nof the outer electron radiation belt during storms, a knowl-\nedge of the time\u2010dependentmorphology of themagnetospheric\nmagnetic field is essential. Additionally, for understanding\nthe drifts and anisotropies of the radiation belts throughout\nstorms, the magnetic field knowledge is essential. And\nfinally, for fully understanding the transport of hot plasma and\nthe formation (or not) of the ring current, this magnetic field\nknowledge is essential. For these reasons, the magnetic field\nat geosynchronous orbit is studied in this project. For the\nstudy, solar wind and magnetospheric measurements from\n63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms in the years 1995\u20132007\nare utilized.\n[13] The solar wind driver for a high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorm is a high\u2010speed stream and the CIR ahead of it [Burlaga\nand Lepping, 1977; Tsurutani et al., 2006a; Richardson,\n2006]. Typically during the passage of the CIR, geomag-\nnetic activity increases from a low level at the beginning of\nthe CIR to storm levels at the end with a strong increase of\ngeomagnetic activity associated with a magnetic sector\nreversal [cf. Borovsky and Denton, 2009c, Table 1; Denton\nand Borovsky, 2009, Table 1]. The pattern of geomagnetic\nactivity can be very repeatable from CIR to CIR [Denton\net al., 2009c]. Additionally, during the declining phase\nof the solar cycle the high\u2010speed stream temporal pattern\ncan be very repeatable with the 27 day rotation of the Sun.\nThe consistency from driver to driver and from storm to storm\nmakes high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms ideal for study using\nsuperposed\u2010epoch analysis [cf. Gosling et al., 1978; Richter\nand Luttrell, 1986; McPherron and Weygand, 2006; Denton\nand Borovsky, 2008, 2009; Borovsky and Denton, 2009c;\nsee also Yermolaev et al., submitted manuscript, 2010, and\nreferences therein], which will be used in this investigation.\n[14] This manuscript is organized as follows. In section 2,\nthe treatment of the GOES magnetic field data, the selection\nof the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, and the super-\nposed\u2010epoch techniques are discussed. In section 3, the\nproperties of the solar wind and the global magnetosphere\nare examined for the 63 storms via superposed\u2010epoch\nanalysis. In section 4, the magnetic field strength at geo-\nsynchronous orbit is examined as functions of time during\nthe storm and local time for the 63 storms. In section 5, the\nstretching angle of the magnetic field at geosynchronous\norbit is examined as functions of time during the storm and\nlocal time for the 63 storms. In section 6, the densities,\ntemperatures, and pressures of the ion and electron plasma\nsheets at geosynchronous orbit are examined for the 63\nstorms and compared with the evolution of the magnetic\nfield at geosynchronous orbit. In section 7, the relativistic\nelectron flux, the number density, the temperature, and the\nspecific entropy of the outer electron radiation belt at geo-\nsynchronous orbit are examined for the 63 storms and\ncompared with the evolution of the magnetic field at geo-\nsynchronous orbit. Section 8 contains discussions about\n(1) the timing of the geosynchronous orbit magnetic field\nperturbations relative to the timing of CIR phenomenology\nin the solar wind and (2) the difficulties with parameteri-\nzation of the geosynchronous orbit magnetic field changes\nin terms of upstream solar wind parameters and geomag-\nnetic indices. The study is summarized in section 9, and the\nfindings are itemized.\n2. Data Sets and Event Selection\n[15] This section contains discussions about the methods\nused to select and clean data, about the selection of high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms for the study, and about the\nsuperposed\u2010epoch data analysis method that will be utilized.\n2.1. GOES Geosynchronous Magnetic Field\nMeasurements\n[16] For the present study, vector magnetic field as mea-\nsurements from the GOES spacecraft [Singer et al., 1996]\nin geosynchronous orbit (6.6 RE) are used. The GOES\nspacecraft measures the magnetic field vector using a flux-\ngate magnetometer [Dunham et al., 1996]. Data from the\nyears 1995\u20132005 is utilized, involving five GOES satellites\n(GOES\u20108 to GOES\u201012). For the one spacecraft GOES\u20108, the\nmagnetic field measurements are corrected by subtracting\n7.22 nT from the z component magnetic field following the\nrecommendations of Tsyganenko et al. [2003].\n[17] The GOES magnetic field data is cleaned to eliminate\nmagnetosheath intervals. When the dynamic pressure of the\nsolar wind is high and the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) is southward, the magnetopause can move drastically\ninward and a geosynchronous satellite on the dayside of the\nEarth can cross the magnetopause into the magnetosheath\n[e.g., Rufenach et al., 1989; McComas et al., 1994]. At\nthose times, the spacecraft will not be measuring magneto-\nspheric magnetic fields, and for the present study, it is\ndesirable to eliminate such intervals from the data set. For\ngeosynchronous spacecraft that carry the magnetospheric\nplasma analyzer (MPA) plasma instruments [Bame et al.,\n1993], identifying the magnetosheath intervals is straight-\nforward [e.g.,McComas et al., 1993]. Crossings of the MPA\nspacecraft into the magnetosheath are rarer for northward\nIMF than for southward IMF [Suvorova et al., 2005].\nSimilarly for GOES spacecraft, unless the solar wind ram\npressure is very high (>10 nPa), crossings into the magne-\ntosheath only occur for southward IMF [cf. Suvorova et al.,\n2005, Figure 10]. At those times, the southward IMF of the\nmagnetosheath has an orientation opposite to the orientation\nof the dayside magnetospheric magnetic field. With this\nknowledge, magnetosheath intervals are cleaned from the\nGOES data set by eliminating all times when the measured\nmagnetic field is southward. (Note that this cleaning method\ndiffers from the field twist method employed by Borovsky\net al. [2009] to clean magnetosheath intervals out of the\nGOES data.)\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n3 of 35\n2.2. Event Selection\n[18] The 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms used in the\npresent study are a subset of the 124 recurring high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms from 1993 to 2005 utilized in previous\nstudies [Denton and Borovsky, 2008, 2009; Denton et al.,\n2009c; Borovsky and Denton, 2009b, 2009c]. Those 124\nhigh\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms were chosen according to\nthe strength and duration of magnetospheric convection,\nignoring the Dst perturbations during the event selection.\n(This is in contrast to some other superposed\u2010epoch studies\n[e.g.,Miyoshi and Kataoka, 2005;Denton et al., 2006; Zhang\net al., 2006; Yermolaev et al., 2007; Longden et al., 2008],\nwhich selected high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms according to\ntheir Dst perturbations.) The 124 storms were found by using\nthe McPherron list of solar wind stream interfaces (Robert\nMcPherron, private communication, 2007) [McPherron and\nWeygand, 2006] and then examining temporal plots of the\nKp index to identify storms following the stream interfaces.\nOnly storms that are preceded by and\/or followed by another\nstorm 27 days earlier or later were accepted into the collec-\ntion. From the original 124 storms, 21 were eliminated as\nbeing weak or short lived, leaving 93 robust high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms in 1993\u20132005. Magnetic field mea-\nsurements from the GOES spacecraft prior to GOES\u20108 were\nnot as reliable as those of GOES\u20108 to GOES\u201012 (Howard\nSinger, private communication, 2009), so only GOES mag-\nnetic fieldmeasurements from 1995 onward are utilized in the\npresent study. Of the 93 storms in 1993\u20132005, 72 are in\n1995\u20132005 era.\n[19] The set of 93 storms ends in the year 2005. Solar\nwind and geomagnetic data were examined for the years\n2006\u20132008 where 27 day repeating high\u2010speed streams are\nprevalent; however, the storm driven by those streams in\nthose years are weak in terms of their Kp signature.\n[20] Of the 72 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms in the\n1995\u20132005 era, only 63 are utilized in the present study. As\nwill be seen in sections 4 and 5 below, the magnetic field\nstretching trends have aspects that are opposite in summer\nand in winter owing to off magnetic equator effects of the\nGOES spacecraft orbit. To prevent the cancellation of\nmagnetic field effects in superposed averages, storms that\noccurred in winter (November, December, and January) are\nnot used. This eliminates nine storms from the list of 72.\n2.3. Superposed Averaging\n[21] Because of the repeatable nature of high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms and their solar wind drivers, high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms are particularly amenable to\nsuperposed\u2010epoch analysis. For the superposed\u2010epoch anal-\nysis, the choice of a trigger to set the zero epoch is crucial\n[cf. Ilie et al., 2008; Denton et al., 2009c; Yermolaev et al.,\nsubmitted manuscript, 2010]. For the present study, the zero\nepoch is chosen to be the onset of storm levels of magneto-\nspheric convection. For each storm, the onset time of con-\nvection (storm onset) is determined from a drop in MBI\n(midnight boundary index). MBI is an index created from\nlocations of the low\u2010latitude edge of the diffuse auroral pre-\ncipitation as determined by DMSP satellite overflights,\nmathematically shifted to local midnight [Gussenhoven et al.,\n1983]. MBI is a proxy for the position of the inner edge of the\nelectron plasma sheet [Elphic et al., 1999], which makes it an\nexcellent indicator of magnetospheric convection, as is Kp\n[Thomsen, 2004], butMBI has higher time resolution than the\n3 h Kp index. For each of the 93 storms, storm onset is taken\nto be the time at which MBI crosses the value 60.7\u00b0. The\nstorm onset times were determined to about 30 min accuracy.\nNote that this trigger differs from the minimum\u2010Dst triggers\nused in older investigations of high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorms [Miyoshi and Kataoka, 2005; Denton et al., 2006;\nZhang et al., 2006; Longden et al., 2008], but this trigger is\nsimilar to the trigger chosen by Yermolaev et al. [2007],\nwhich was the first point corresponding to a strong decrease\nin Dst.\n3. The 63 High\u2010Speed Stream\u2010Driven Storms\n[22] This section presents an overview of the properties of\nthe solar wind that drives the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorms and presents an overview of the global reaction of the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere to that solar wind driver.\n3.1. The Solar Wind Driver\n[23] The driver for high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms is\nfast solar wind, which is preceded by a CIR. The first por-\ntion of the CIR that passes the Earth is compressed slow\nwind, and the second portion of the CIR is compressed fast\nwind [cf. Siscoe et al., 1969; Burlaga and Lepping, 1977;\nRichardson, 2006]. The two portions are separated by an\nabrupt stream interface [cf. Burlaga, 1974; Gosling et al.,\n1978; Forsyth and Marsch, 1999; McPherron and Weygand,\n2006].\n[24] In Figure 1 superposed\u2010epoch averages of several\nsolar wind parameters at Earth for the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms are plotted, with the zero epoch (vertical\ndashed line) being the onset of storm convection. The plot in\nFigure 1 extends from 3 days prior to storm onset to 4 days\nafter onset.\n[25] In Figure 1 (top), the superposed average of the solar\nwind speed at Earth is plotted. In the days prior to storm\nonset, the Earth is bathed in slow solar wind with average\nspeeds of \u223c400 km\/s or less. Storm onset occurs as the solar\nwind speed is rising at Earth and in the days after storm\nonset the Earth is bathed in fast wind with average speeds of\n\u223c550 km\/s or greater.\n[26] In the second panel of Figure 1 the superposed\naverage of the y component (GSE) velocity of the solar wind\nis plotted. Note the characteristic westward (\u2212y) then east-\nward (+y) perturbation of the CIR [cf. Siscoe et al., 1969;\nBurlaga, 1974]. The CIR stream interface, which separates\nslow wind (cool, lumpy, low specific entropy) from fast\nwind (hot, homogeneous, high specific entropy), is typically\ntaken to be the point of reversal from westward (\u2212vy) to\neastward (+vy) flow [e.g., Gosling et al., 1978; McPherron\nand Weygand, 2006]. As can be seen in the second panel,\nin the superposed averages, the onset of the storm begins a\nfew hours prior to the passage of the stream interface.\nHence, the storm onset occurs during the passage of the\ncompressed slow wind [see also Borovsky and Denton,\n2009c, Table 1; Denton and Borovsky, 2009, Table 1].\n[27] In the third panel of Figure 1 the superposed average\nof the magnetic field strength in the solar wind plasma is\nplotted. As can be seen, in the slow wind days ahead of the\nstorm onset and in the fast wind days afterward, the field\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n4 of 35\nstrength is similar (\u223c5 nT). In the CIR (where the westward\u2010\neastward flow deflection is ongoing), the field is com-\npressed, as is the solar wind plasma. In the superposed\naverage of the solar wind magnetic field for the 63 storms,\nthe compression is about a factor of 2 near the stream\ninterface just after storm onset [see also Borovsky and\nDenton, 2009a].\n[28] In the fourth panel of Figure 1, the number density of\nthe solar wind plasma is plotted. The number density tends\nto be somewhat higher in the slow wind ahead of the CIR\nthan in the fast wind behind [cf. Gosling et al., 1978;\nRichter and Luttrell, 1986; Richardson, 2006; Borovsky and\nDenton, 2009a]. In the superposed averages, some of this\nhigher density in the slow wind is owed to noncompressive\nhigh\u2010density structures ahead of the stream interface near\nthe sector reversal [e.g., Gosling et al., 1981; Borrini et al.,\n1981].\n[29] In the fifth panel of Figure 1, the superposed average\nof the solar wind ram pressure rv2 is plotted. The temporal\nbehavior of the ram pressure follows the temporal behavior\nof the solar wind plasma density (fourth panel): the ram\npressure is high in the CIR because the density is high there.\n[30] In the sixth panel of Figure 1, the superposed average\nof the Alfven Mach number MA = v\/vA of the solar wind is\nplotted. As can be seen, the average Mach number of the\nwind is high before storm onset and after storm onset. This\nis contrary to the case of coronal mass ejection\u2010driven\nstorms where the solar wind Mach number can be low [cf.\nBorovsky and Denton, 2006; Lavraud and Borovsky,\n2008]. At low Mach number, several unusual aspects to the\nmorphology of the stormtime magnetosphere can occur\n[Lavraud and Borovsky, 2008; Borovsky et al., 2009], which\nmakes the operation of the magnetosphere different for\nCME\u2010driven storms from CIR\u2010driven storms [Borovsky\nand Denton, 2006].\n[31] In Figure 1 (bottom), the superposed average of the\nz component (GSM) of the solar wind magnetic field is\nplotted. Note that the average of Bz is positive (northward)\nbefore storm onset and negative (southward) after onset.\nThis is caused by a sector reversal and the Russell\u2010\nMcPherron effect [Russell and McPherron, 1973]: if the\nParker spiral magnetic field is Russell\u2010McPherron effective\nin the fast wind after the sector reversal, then the event (a\nstorm) may be chosen, and it follows that for chosen events\n(storms) the Parker spiral magnetic field prior to the sector\nreversal will be Russell\u2010McPherron noneffective (a calm)\n[Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006]. Note in Figure 1 (bottom)\nthat Bz is very strong and southward at the beginning of the\nFigure 1. Using superposed averages of OMNI2 measure-\nments, the solar wind driver for the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms is explored. The zero epoch (vertical dashed\nline) is the onset of storm convection. In the top, the solar\nwind speed is plotted. In the second panel, the transverse\nvelocity of the solar wind is plotted. In the third panel, the\nsolar wind magnetic field strength is plotted. In the fourth\npanel, the solar wind plasma number density is plotted. In\nthe fifth panel, the solar wind ramp pressure is plotted. In\nthe sixth panel, the Alfven Mach number of the solar wind\nis plotted. And in the bottom, the Bz (GSM) component of\nthe solar wind magnetic field is plotted.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n5 of 35\nstorm. This is owed to the compression of the magnetic field\nwithin the CIR, making Bz of larger amplitude. It should be\nnoted that the plots in Figure 1 only extend to 4 days after\nthe storm onset: high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms can persist\nfor more than 4 days.\n3.2. The 63 Geomagnetic Storms\n[32] The reaction of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere is dis-\nplayed in the Figure 2, where superposed averages of sev-\neral geomagnetic indices are plotted along with the flux of\nrelativistic electrons at geosynchronous orbit. For reference,\nthe superposed average of the solar wind speed is plotted in\nFigure 2 (top). As in Figure 1, the zero epoch (vertical\ndashed line) for Figure 2 is the onset of storm levels of\nmagnetospheric convection. The plots of Figure 2 extend\nfrom 3 days prior to storm onset to 4 days after onset.\n[33] In the second panel of Figure 2, the superposed\naverage of the Kp index [Bartels and Veldkamp, 1949;\nRostoker, 1972] is plotted. The Kp index is low prior to\nstorm onset. Sometimes before a high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorm there is a \u201ccalm before the storm\u201dwherein the Kp index\nis near zero for a day or two [Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006;\nBorovsky and Denton, 2009b]. Calms before the storms\ncontribute to the average Kp being low prior to storm onset in\nFigure 2. Note in the second panel that Kp rises quickly (in a\nfraction of a day) at storm onset and then decays slowly over\nseveral days. Note that high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms are\nlong\u2010duration events: the storm activity itself can last for\nseveral days [cf. Tsurutani et al., 1995, 1999; Borovsky and\nDenton, 2006, 2008], as indicated by the elevated levels of\nKp long after storm onset in Figure 2. The slow decline of the\nsuperposed average of Kp is owed to a slow decline of the\naverage of the solar wind speed in the days after storm onset\n(see Figure 2, top).\n[34] In the third panel of Figure 2, the superposed average\nof the Midnight Boundary Index (MBI) [Gussenhoven et al.,\n1983] is plotted for the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms.\nThe behavior of MBI mirrors the behavior of Kp (second\npanel), which is expected since MBI is a measure of the\nposition of the inner edge of the electron plasma sheet\n[Elphic et al., 1999], as is Kp [Thomsen, 2004].\n[35] In the fourth panel of Figure 2 the superposed aver-\nage of the polar cap index (PCI) [Troshichev et al., 1988,\n2000] from Thule station is plotted for the 63 high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms. PCI is a measure of the cross\u2010polar\ncap current flowing in the ionosphere and is related to the\ncross\u2010polar cap potential [Troshichev et al., 1996; Ridley\nand Kihn, 2004]. The behavior of PCI resembles the\nbehavior of Kp: PCI is weak and weakly decaying before\nthe storm onset, PCI rises at storm onset, and then it decays\nslowly during the several days of the storm. Note in Figure 2\nthat the temporal trace of PCI is sharper than the trace of\nKp: this is owed to the 1 h time resolution of PCI in\nFigure 2 and the 3 h resolution of Kp.\n[36] In the fifth panel of Figure 2, the superposed average\nof the Dst index [Rostoker, 1972; Liemohn et al., 2001] is\nplotted for the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. Prior to\nFigure 2. Superposed averages are plotted for the 63 high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms. The zero epoch (vertical dashed\nline) is the onset of storm convection. Plotted are the solar\nwind speed (top), the Kp index (second panel), MBI (third\npanel), PCI\u2010Thule (fourth panel), Dst (black) and Dst*\n(gray) (fifth panel), and the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV omnidirectional\nelectron flux at geosynchronous orbit (bottom). The electron\nflux is a multisatellite average using measurements at all\nlocal times.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n6 of 35\nstorm onset, Dst goes positive owing to the large increase in\nthe ram pressure of the solar wind (cf. the fifth panel of\nFigure 1). At storm onset, Dst commences its move into\nnegative values as the intensity of the storm rises. Note that\nfor high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms strong negative values\nof Dst are unusual. For the 63 storms of Figure 2, the\nsuperposed average of Dst does not reach \u221235 nT. (But note,\nhowever, if the zero epoch would have been chosen to be\nthe time of minimum Dst, the superposed average of Dst\nwould have reached somewhat stronger negative values.) As\nis known, high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms are weak Dst\nmakers [Borovsky and Denton, 2006; Denton et al., 2009b].\nAlso plotted in the fifth panel of Figure 2 is Dst*, the value\nof Dst corrected for the contribution of magnetopause\ncurrents, which increase as the solar wind dynamic pres-\nsure Pram increases. Dst* is given by the expression Dst* =\nDst \u2212 bPram1\/2 + c [Su and Konradi, 1975; Burton et al., 1975],\nwhere b is the change of Dst resulting from a change in\nPram\n1\/2 and c is the value of Dst on a quiet day. In the literature, a\nwide variety of values for (b, c) can be found, e.g., (24.1, 19.03)\n[Su and Konradi, 1975], (15.8, 20) [Burton et al., 1975],\n(18.2, 18) [Feldstein et al., 1984], (12.6, 6) [Pudovkin et al.,\n1985], (25.32, 10.6) [Vassiliadis et al., 1999], and (7.26, 11)\n[O\u2019Brien and McPherron, 2000], where the b values are in\nunits of nT (nPa)\u22121\/2 and the c values are in units of nT. We\nwill presently contribute our more sets of (b, c) coefficients in\nthis study. These Dst* coefficients will be derived from data\nfits in the time intervals just before storm onset when the\nmagnetopause current is the dominant contribution to Dst\nand when a clean measurement of its effect can be obtained.\nThe coefficients will then be used at all times to remove the\neffects of the magnetopause current to get a clearer view of\nthe effects on Dst of other currents.\n[37] In Figure 3, the superposed average of Dst (in units of\nnT) is plotted as a function of the square root of the\nsuperposed average of Pram = rv\n2 of the solar wind (in units\nof nPa) for the 63 storms; the plotted points are 1 h values\nover the time range from 32 h prior to storm onset, at which\ntime the superposed average of the ram pressure of the solar\nwind begins to rise to 3 h prior to onset, at which time\ngeomagnetic activity begins to overwhelm the pressure\neffect to turn the Dst curve toward the negative. A linear\u2010\nregression fit is plotted as the blue line in Figure 3, which\nhas the formula Dst = 20.7Pram\n1\/2 \u2212 27.7. This fit yields\ncoefficients (b, c) = (20.7, 27.7). A Gaussian linear fit to the\nsame data yields the coefficients (b, c) = (21.3, 28.5); the\nGaussian fit is plotted as the red line. When the individual\nhourly Dst and Pram values for the 63 storms are all plotted\nFigure 3. Hourly values of the superposed average of the Dst index for the 63 storms are plotted (black\npoints) as a function of the superposed average of the ram pressure of the solar wind. The data are from\n32 h prior to onset to 3 h prior to onset. The linear correlation coefficient is +0.98. A linear regression fit\nto the data appears as the blue line and a Gaussian fit to the data appears as the red line.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n7 of 35\ntogether and fit to obtain the b and c coefficients, then the\nresult is (b, c) = (11.9, 14.4) if a linear regression fit is used\nand (b, c) = (48.3, 68.6) if a Gaussian fit is used. These are\nfour sets of (b, c) coefficients describing the pressure cor-\nrection to Dst, yielding four manners in which to calculate\nDst* from Dst. In Figure 4, the superposed average of Dst is\nplotted (black) as a function of time along with the four Dst*\ncurves for the four sets of coefficients that were obtained\nfrom the 63 storm data set: the (20.7, 27.7) Dst* (blue curve)\nobtained from a linear\u2010regression fit to the superposed\u2010Dst\ndata, the (21.3, 28.5) Dst* (purple curve) obtained from a\nGaussian fit to the superposed\u2010Dst data, the (11.9, 14.4)\nDst* (green curve) obtained from a linear regression fit to\nthe 63 storm Dst data, and the (48.3, 68.6) Dst* (red curve)\nobtained from a Gaussian fit to the 63 storm Dst data. As\ncan be seen, there are substantial differences in the four Dst*\ncurves, yielding in particular substantial differences in the\nminimum Dst* value of the storms. The minimum of the\nsuperposed average of Dst* ranges from \u221243 to \u221268 nT,\ndepending on the strength of the pressure correction. Linear\nregression fits systematically yield the linear slopes under-\nestimated [cf. Borovsky et al., 1998b]: this results in an\nundercorrection for the effect of pressure on the Dst index.\nThis is noticeable in the green curve of Figure 4, where the\npositive slope of Dst versus time prior to storm onset (black)\nstill remains in the Dst* curve (green). The Gaussian fit to\nthe data from the 63 storms yields a Dst* (red curve) that\nappears to overcorrect the pressure perturbation: this is seen\nin the red curve as the steady decrease in the value of Dst*\nprior to storm onset as the ram pressure of the solar wind\nincreases. This overcorrection for pressure also produces a\nmuch deeper minimum to the Dst* curve after storm onset.\nThe two curves (blue and purple) obtained by fitting the\nsuperposed average of Dst as a function of the superposed\naverage of the solar wind ram pressure appear to do the best\njob of correctly removing the pressure perturbation prior to\nstorm onset. The two curves are very similar: the blue curve\nhas a smaller offset of Dst* from 0 prior to storm onset so it\nwill be selected as the most accurate removal of the pressure\nperturbation from Dst. Hence, for the high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms, a pressure\u2010corrected Dst will be taken to have\nthe form\nDst* \u00bc Dst\u0002 bP1=2ram \u00fe c; \u00f01a\u00de\nb \u00bc 20:7 nT nPa\u00f0 \u00de\u00021=2; \u00f01b\u00de\nc \u00bc 27:7 nT; \u00f01c\u00de\nwhere Dst* andDst are in units of nT andPram = rv\n2 is in units\nof nPa. Using the definition of Dst* given by expressions (1),\nthe superposed average of Dst* for the 63 storms is plotted\nas the gray curve in the fifth panel of Figure 2. As can be\nseen by examining the Dst* curve in Figure 2 (see also\nFigure 4. The superposed average of the Dst index is plotted (black) as a function of time for the\n63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. Using four sets of coefficients for the pressure correction to Dst,\nfour values of Dst* are produced and plotted. The green and red curves are superposed averages of the\npressure\u2010corrected Dst, and the blue and purple curves are pressure corrections to the superposed aver-\nage of Dst. The blue curve corresponds to the Dst* formula given by expressions (1).\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n8 of 35\nFigure 4), in the several days after storm onset the magni-\ntude of the Dst* perturbation slowly decreases. This has been\nreferred to as a recovery of Dst [e.g., Knipp et al., 1998;\nGonzalez et al., 1999; Tsurutani et al., 2006b; Turner et al.,\n2009], although its behavior is not that of a classical recovery\ncaused by temporal decay of trapped\u2010particle fluxes after\nmagnetospheric driving ceases [e.g., Dessler and Parker,\n1959; Pudovkin et al., 1985]; rather, during this declining\u2010\nKp phase there is probably a balance between driving and\nloss of the hot plasma of the magnetosphere and that equi-\nlibrium slowly shifts as the driving of the magnetosphere\nslowly weakens with slowly declining solar wind speed\nproducing the temporally weakening Dst perturbation.\n[38] In Figure 2 (bottom), the superposed average of the\n1.1\u20131.5 MeV omnidirectional electron flux at geosynchro-\nnous orbit is plotted. The flux is obtained from seven\nspacecrafts carrying the SOPA energetic particle detector\n[Belian et al., 1992; Cayton and Belian, 2007]. Half\u2010hour\nrunning averages of the measurements on each satellite were\nused to construct a multispacecraft logarithmic average (sum\nof log fluxes divided by number satellites) of all the available\nfluxes at any time [Borovsky and Denton, 2009b]. The mul-\ntispacecraft average flux was cleaned by removing times of\nknown solar energetic particle events and its superposed\naverage is plotted in the Figure 2. As can be seen in Figure 2\n(bottom), the geosynchronous electron flux decays in the\ndays prior to storm onset, drops to low values at storm onset,\nand grows slowly and steadily in the days after storm onset.\nThe slow decay prior to storms is owed to pitch angle\nscattering in a dense plasmasphere that forms during calms\nbefore the storms [cf. Borovsky and Denton, 2009b], the\ndropout (or not) at storm onset is associated with the occur-\nrence (or not) of a superdense plasma sheet in the magneto-\nsphere [cf. Borovsky and Denton, 2009c] and the steady rise\nin flux during the days after storm onset is associated with a\nslow heating of the outer electron radiation belt [Borovsky\net al., 1998a; Denton et al., 2009c].\n[39] In the following sections of this paper, more detailed\nlooks at the reactions of the magnetospheric magnetic field\nmorphology, the magnetospheric hot plasmas, and the outer\nFigure 5. Using 1 min time resolution magnetic field measurements from GOES\u201012, the magnetic field\nstrength at geosynchronous orbit is plotted (gray points) as a function of local time for the year 2007. The\nred points are 500 point running averages of the gray points. 500 point running averages are also plotted\nfor winter\u2010only measurements (green points) and for summer\u2010only measurements (blue points). The nom-\ninal dipole field strength at geosynchronous orbit is plotted as the yellow dashed line.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n9 of 35\nelectron radiation belt during these high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms will be presented.\n4. Compression of the Magnetic Field During\nthe Storms\n[40] Chiefly on the dayside, the magnetic field of the\nEarth is known to be compressed by the solar wind to values\nstronger than dipole field strengths [Hones, 1963; Mead,\n1964]. Exceptions are during low Mach number geomag-\nnetic storms where dawn\u2010to\u2010dusk auroral zone currents can\nweaken the dayside magnetic field below dipole values\n[Siscoe et al., 2004; Borovsky et al., 2009].\n[41] In Figure 5, the magnetic field strength at geosyn-\nchronous orbit is plotted as a function of local time for\n1 year (2007) of measurements by the GOES\u201012 spacecraft.\nIndividual hourly averages of the field strength are plotted in\ngray and a 500\u2010point running average of the GOES\u201012\nmeasurements for 2007 is plotted in red. As can be seen in\nthe gray points, in the 1 year there is a lot of variation to the\nmagnetic field strength at any given local time. The year\n2007 was in the declining phase of the solar cycle with\nregular intervals of high\u2010speed wind preceded by CIRs. The\nrunning average (red) shows the local time trend underlying\nthe data: as can be seen in the red points, the field strength\ntends to be highest at about local noon and lowest at about\nlocal midnight. A nominal dipole field strength (ME = 7.8 \u00d7\n1022 Am2 [Olson and Amit, 2006]) at geosynchronous orbit\nis 106 nT, as indicated by the dashed yellow horizontal line\nin Figure 5. As can be seen, the measured field strength\ntends to be higher than dipole on the dayside and lower than\ndipole on the nightside. Separating the measurements into a\nsummer subset (June, July, August) and a winter subset\n(November, December, January), 500 point running avera-\nges are produced for summer and for winter, and these are\nplotted as the blue points and green points, respectively. As\ncan be seen, there is a difference between summer and\nwinter in the local time trend of the magnetic field strength:\nthe nightside magnetic field strength at geosynchronous\norbit is on average weaker in winter than in summer. This is\nowed to the fact that the GOES\u201012 spacecraft, which is in\nthe geographic equator, is north of the dipole magnetic field\nequator; on the nightside, the hinging of the magnetotail\nbrings GOES\u201012 closer to the hinged magnetic equator in\nwinter and brings GOES\u201012 farther from the hinged mag-\nnetic equator in summer [McPherron and Barfield, 1980;\nSkone et al., 1995].\n[42] The seasonal difference in the local time trends of the\nfield strength B (Figure 5) is not great, but as will be seen in\nsection 5, the resulting difference in the local time trend of\nthe stretching angle of the magnetic field will be substantial.\nIn fact, the stretching\u2010angle trends will be reversed from\nsummer to winter. For this reason, in the superposed\u2010epoch\nstudies of the magnetospheric magnetic field in this paper,\nwinter data (November, December, January) will be excluded\nand only spring, summer, and fall data will be included.\n[43] Note that there are systematic differences in the local\ntime trends seen by geosynchronous spacecraft with different\nlongitudes [see alsoMcPherron and Barfield, 1980;Moldwin\net al., 1998; Ohtani et al., 2007]. The GOES spacecraft are\nlocated in either of two longitudes: 135\u00b0W longitude\n(GOES\u2010West) or 75\u00b0W longitude (GOES\u2010East). In Figure 6,\n500 point running averages of the magnetic field strength at\ngeosynchronous orbit are plotted for two different locations\nFigure 6. For two different years (1996 and 2007) and for two different GOES satellites (GOES\u2010East\nand GOES\u2010West), 500 point running averages of the magnetic field strength at geosynchronous orbit ver-\nsus local time are plotted. To make the running averages, 1 min time resolution measurements were plot-\nted versus local time. The dipole field strength at geosynchronous orbit is plotted as the dashed gray line.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n10 of 35\n(GOES\u2010East and GOES\u2010West) and for two different years,\n1996 (solar minimum) and 2007 (declining phase). All\nspacecraft are located over the geographic equator, but\nGOES\u2010East was more than 10\u00b0 above the magnetic equator,\nGOES\u2010West was closer to the magnetic equator. As can be\nseen in Figure 6, the spacecrafts in the GOES\u2010West loca-\ntions see deeper minima for B on the nightside. And as can\nbe seen in the figure, the nightside minima are deeper during\nsolar minimum than during the declining phase.\n[44] In Figure 7, the superposed\u2010epoch average of the\nmagnetic field strength measured by GOES\u20108 to GOES\u201012\nfor the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms in 1995\u20132005 is\nplotted versus time (horizontal) and versus local time of\nobservation (vertical). Time t = 0 in the plot is storm onset.\nAs in Figure 5, Figure 7 shows the average magnetic field\nstrength to be higher at local noon than on the nightside. As\ncan be seen in Figure 7, the magnetic field strength on the\ndayside begins to increase about 1 day or more before\nthe storm onset and decrease in the day after onset. On the\nnightside there is an indication of a weak decrease in the\nmagnetic field strength at about the time of storm onset and\na brief strengthening of the magnetic field after onset.\n[45] In Figure 8, the superposed average of the magnetic\nfield strength at geosynchronous orbit is plotted (bottom)\nfor four local times: noon (9 LT\u201315 LT), dusk (15 LT\u2013\n21 LT), midnight (21 LT\u20133 LT), and dawn (3 LT\u20139 LT).\nIn Figure 8 (bottom), the four thin curves are 6 h running\ntime averages and the four thick curves are 24 h running\naverages. The nominal dipole field strength at geosynchro-\nnous orbit is indicated with the horizontal dashed line. In\nFigure 8 (top), the superposed average of the ram pressure of\nthe solar wind is plotted: the thin curve has a 1 h time\nresolution, and the thick curve is a 24 h running average. In\nconjunction with the increased ram pressure of the com-\npressed solar wind in the CIR (top), the compression of the\ndayside magnetosphere is seen in the black curve (bottom).\n[46] The increase in the dayside magnetic field strength in\nthe magnetosphere during the CIR passage is in approximate\ncorrespondence to the change in the solar wind dynamic\npressure associated with the increased solar wind plasma\ndensity in the CIR. This is shown in Figure 9 where the 24 h\naveraged of the superposed average of Bmag in the noon\nsector of the magnetosphere is replotted (black curve) for the\n63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms and four mathematical\nexpressions representing fits to magnetic field changes at\ngeosynchronous noon as functions of solar wind ram pres-\nsure changes are plotted. The first fit (red curve in Figure 9)\nis the Wing and Sibeck [1997] equation (1) fit to Bz at\ngeosynchronous orbit B = C0 + C2(rv\n2)1\/2 with C2 given by\nWing and Sibeck to be C2 \u2248 25 nT\/(nPa)1\/2 at local noon and\nC0 taken to be 82 nT. The second fit (blue curve in Figure 9)\nis the fit from Figure 5a of Borodkova et al. [2006] (see also\nFigure 5 of Borodkova et al. [2008]) B = Bo + 6.25 rv\n2 with\nBo taken to be the dipole value 106 nT. The third fit (green\ncurve in Figure 9) is the fit from Figure 3a of Villante and\nPiersanti [2008] for noon B = Bo + 27(rv\n2)1\/2 with Bo\ntaken to be 78 nT. The fourth fit (purple) is obtained by\nrunning the T96 magnetic field model [Tsyganenko, 1996]\nfor the geosynchronous equator at local noon (for March 21\nwith Dst = 0 and B = 0 in the solar wind), varying the solar\nwind ram pressure rv2 and fitting the model output: the fit\nB = 103 + 7.11(rv2)0.816 is obtained with B and Bo in units\nof nT and rv2 in units nPa. The four fit curves in Figure 9\napproximately describe the magnitude of the increase in the\nmagnetospheric magnetic field strength at geosynchronous\norbit, with the T96 model fit being the poorest. The time\nprofile of the increased field strength in the dayside mag-\nnetosphere (black curve in Figure 8, bottom) follows the\ntime profile of the ram pressure of the solar wind for the\ncompressed CIR (Figure 8, top), although the magneto-\nspheric perturbation leads in time for the solar wind pressure\nperturbation as is clearly seen in Figure 9.\n[47] To obtain an empirical relation between the dayside\nmagnetic field strength B at geosynchronous orbit and the\nsimultaneous solar wind ram pressure Pram = rv\n2 during the\ndayside compression perturbation, measurements of B and\nPram are extracted and fit. The data utilized are the 24 h average\nof the superposed average of B as measured by the GOES\nspacecraft within \u00b13 h of local noon and the 24 h average of\nthe superposed average of rv2 obtained from OMNI. Data\nare extracted over the time interval extending from 4 days\nprior to storm onset to 4 days after storm onset. Simulta-\nneous values of B and rv2 are the black points plotted in\nFigure 10. A linear regression fit to themeasurements appears\nas the gray line in Figure 10: that fit for the magnetic field\nstrength at geosynchronous orbit in the noon sector is\nB \u00bc 106\u00fe 6:3Pram; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere B is in units of nT and Pram = rvrv\n2 is in units of nPa.\nThis fit is almost exactly the same as the fit from Figure 5a of\nBorodkova et al. [2006] (blue curve in Figure 9).\n[48] As can be seen by comparing the dusk (blue) and\ndawn (green) curves in Figure 8 (bottom), there is a dawn\u2010\ndusk asymmetry to the magnetic field strength perturbation\nin the magnetosphere: the dusk sector shows some compres-\nsion prior to the storm onset, whereas the dawn sector does not.\nIn general, the average field strengths in the dawn and dusk\nsectors of geosynchronous orbit are near the dipole value\n(horizontal dashed line), except for the weak enhancement in\nthe dusk sector prior to storm onset. The average field at local\nmidnight is well below the dipole value, as seen in the red\nFigure 7. Using measurements from five GOES satellites\nduring 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, the superposed\naverage of the magnetic field strength at geosynchronous\norbit (color) is plotted as a function of time from storm onset\n(horizontal axis) and local time (vertical axis).\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n11 of 35\ncurve in Figure 8 (bottom). Note that the thin red curve (with\n6 h averaging) shows an indication of the nightside field\nstrength after storm onset and a weaker indication of a\nnightside field depression at storm onset. These field strength\nperturbations could bemanifestations of strong stretching into\na tail geometry.\n5. Stretching of the Magnetic Field During\nthe Storms\n[49] On the nightside of the Earth, the magnetic field\nbecomes distorted from a dipole geometry into a magneto-\ntail geometry [Piddington, 1960; Heppner et al., 1963]\nsignified via the stretching angle \u0002stretch of the field moving\nfrom dipole values (\u0002stretch \u223c 90\u00b0) toward magnetotail values\n(\u0002stretch \u223c 0\u00b0). Here the stretching angle is taken to be \u0002stretch =\narctan(Bz\/(Bx\n2 + By\n2)1\/2) with the field components in GSM\ncoordinates.\n[50] In Figure 11, the magnetic field stretching angle\n\u0002stretch at geosynchronous orbit is plotted as a function of\nlocal time for 1 year (2007) ofmeasurements by theGOES\u201012\nspacecraft. Individual hourly averages of the field strength\nare plotted in gray and a 500 point running average of the\nGOES\u201012 measurements is plotted in red. As can be seen\nFigure 8. Superposed averages are plotted for 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. In the top, the ram\npressure of the solar wind from OMNI2 measurements is plotted. In the bottom, the magnetic field\nstrength at geosynchronous orbit as measured by five GOES satellites is plotted in the noon sector (black),\nthe dusk sector (blue), the dawn sector (green), and the midnight sector (red). In the top, the thin curve has\n1 h time resolution and the thick curve is a 24 h running average; in the bottom, the thin curves are 6 h\nrunning averages and the thick curves are 24 h running averages.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n12 of 35\nin the gray points, there is a lot of variation to the stretching\nangle at any given local time. The running average shows the\nlocal time trend underlying the data: as can be seen field\norientation tends to be most dipolar at about local noon and\ncan vary greatly at local midnight. Separating the 2007\nmeasurements into a summer subset (June, July, August) and\na winter subset (November, December, January), 500 point\nrunning averages are produced for summer and for winter and\nthese are plotted as the blue points and green points, respec-\ntively, in Figure 11. As can be seen, there is a strong differ-\nence between summer and winter in the local time trend of\nthe magnetic field stretching angle as measured by GOES\u201012:\nin summer, the stretching angles have the field dipolar on the\ndayside and tail\u2010like on the nightside, but in winter, the\nfield is more dipolar on the nightside than on the dayside.\nAs was noted in section 4, to avoid reversals of some trends in\nthe superposed\u2010epoch analysis, winter data (November,\nDecember, January) will be excluded from the high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms studied in this report.\n[51] In Figure 12, 500 point running averages of the\nstretching angle \u0002stretch are plotted for two spacecraft (a\nGOES\u2010East satellite and a GOES\u2010West satellite) for 2 years\n(a solar\u2010minimumyear 1996 and a declining\u2010phase year 2007).\nNote the differences in the trends between the four curves in\nFigure 12. The trend difference is very strong between the\nGOES\u2010West (bottom two curves) and the GOES\u2010East (top two\ncurves) [see also McPherron and Barfield, 1980; Moldwin\net al., 1998;Ohtani et al., 2007] but not so different between\nthe solar\u2010minimum and declining\u2010phase curves. The mea-\nsured stretch of the magnetic field away from dipole tends to\nbe greater for the GOES\u2010East location (off the magnetic\nequator) than it is for the GOES\u2010West location (near the\nmagnetic equator).\nFigure 9. The 24 running average of the superposed average of the magnetic field strength in the noon\nsector of geosynchronous orbit as measured by five GOES spacecraft for 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorms is plotted as the black curve. The colored curves are plotted from various expressions for the geo-\nsynchronous orbit magnetic field strength as functions of the ram pressure of the solar wind; in the ex-\npressions the 24 h running average of the superposed average of the OMNI2 solar wind ram pressure\nfor the 63 storms is used.\nFigure 10. For the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms,\nthe 24 h running average of the superposed average of the\ngeosynchronous orbit magnetic field strength in the noon\nsector is plotted as a function of the 24 h running average\nof the superposed average of the solar wind ram pressure.\nThe magnetic field is measured by five GOES satellites,\nand the ram pressure is from OMNI2. The points plotted\nare hourly data from 4 days prior to storm onset to 4 days\nafter onset.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n13 of 35\n[52] In Figure 13, the superposed average of the magnetic\nfield stretching angle \u0002stretch measured by GOES\u20108 to\nGOES\u201012 for the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms is\nplotted versus time (horizontal) and local time (vertical).\nTime t = 0 is the time of storm onset. As can be seen, the\nfield is closest to dipolar near local noon and is stretched on\nthe nightside. There is little perturbation with time to the\nstretching angle on the dayside. At about the time of storm\nonset enhanced stretching can be seen in Figure 13 across\nthe entire nightside.\n[53] In Figure 14, the superposed average of the magnetic\nfield stretching angle \u0002stretch is plotted for four local times:\nnoon (9 LT\u201315 LT), dusk (15 LT\u201321 LT), midnight (21 LT\u2013\n3 LT), and dawn (3 LT\u20139 LT). In Figure 14 (bottom), the\nfour thin curves are 6 h running time averages and the four\nthick curves are 24 h running averages. The black curves in\nFigure 14 show that the orientation of the dayside magnetic\nfield at geosynchronous orbit changes little through the\nhigh\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storm. However, the magnetic\nfield in the dawn (green), dusk (blue), and midnight (red)\nsectors undergoes stretching. In the superposed average, the\nstretching begins about 12 h prior to the onset of the storm\n(see thin curves). Often this is the onset of weak activity\nprior to the magnetosphere reaching storm levels of con-\nvection. A guess would be that sector reversals in the slow\nwind upstream of the CIR stream interface produce mildly\ngeoeffective intervals. In the superposed averages, the\nmidnight sector stretching reaches its peak almost 12 h after\nthe storm onset. Note that the stretching in the midnight\nsector exhibits two phases: a strong\u2010stretching phase during\nthe first day or so of the storm followed by a long\u2010lived\nmodest\u2010stretching phase where the angle slowly evolves\nback toward dipolar values. Comparing the blue and green\ncurves in Figure 14, one would conclude that the change in\nstretching angle during the storm is about the same in the\ndawn sector as it is in the dusk sector, with average values of\nthe stretching always being greater in the dawn sector\n(green) than in the dusk sector (blue). Note that the dawn\nand dusk sectors do not exhibit the two phases of stretching,\nthey only seem to exhibit the modest\u2010stretching phase that is\nlong\u2010lived. The average value of the stretching is greater\nstill in the midnight sector (red), and the midnight sector\nFigure 11. Using 1 min time resolution magnetic field measurements from GOES\u201012, the magnetic field\nstretching angle at geosynchronous orbit is plotted (gray points) as a function of local time for the year\n2007. The red points are 500 point running averages of the gray points. 500 point running averages are\nalso plotted for winter\u2010only measurements (green points) and for summer\u2010only measurements (blue\npoints).\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n14 of 35\nstretching perturbation associated with the storm is larger\ntoo. Comparing the thin red curve (6 h running average)\nwith the thick red curve (24 h running average) in Figure 14,\none can conclude that looking with higher time resolution\nwill find greater amounts of stretching early in the storm.\n[54] As can be discerned by examining the red curve in\nFigure 14, the stretched magnetic field at geosynchronous\norbit on the nightside relaxes partway back toward quasi\u2010\ndipole geometry by about 48 h after storm onset. Hence, the\nnightside stretching appears to have two phases: a strong\nstretching early in the storm and a milder stretching for the\nlatter portions of the storm.\n[55] In Figure 15, the temporal profile of the Dst* index is\ncompared with the temporal profile of the stretching angle \u0002\nin the midnight sector. The superposed averages of \u0002 (black\ncurve, left axis) and Dst* (red curve, right axis) are plotted\nas functions of time for the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorms. The Dst* curve is obtained from Dst via expression\n(1). To put both quantities on equal footing, 12 h running\naverages of both quantities are shown. The plot extends\nfrom 2 days before storm onset to 5 days after onset. The\ntwo\u2010phase shape of the stretching\u2010angle curve (black) is\nclearly seen, with a strong stretching phase from t = \u22120.6 days\nto t = +1.0 days and a modest\u2010stretching phase after t =\n1.0 days. The Dst* curve also exhibits a two\u2010phase shape,\nwith a \u201cstrong\u2010stretching phase\u201d from t = \u22120.3 days to t =\n+1.2 days and with a \u201cmodest\u2010stretching phase\u201d after t =\n+1.2 days. The \u201cstrong\u2010stretching phase\u201d of both quantities\n(\u0002 and Dst*) are approximately coincidental in time. The\nstrong\u2010stretching phase in \u0002 is only seen in the midnight\n(tail) sector (see Figure 14): we hypothesize that the strong\u2010\nstretching phase in Dst* is associated with the contribution\nof tail currents to the Dst index. For the two curves (Dst*\nand \u0002), the decay portions of the strong\u2010stretching phase and\nthe decay portions of the modest\u2010stretching phase are fit\nwith lines: these fits are shown as the two green dashed lines\nfor \u0002 and the two red dashed lines for Dst*. The slopes of the\nlinear fits are indicated in Figure 14. As can be seen, for\n\u0002 the ratio of the slopes (strong decay versus modest decay)\nis about 14 whereas for Dst* the ratio of the slopes is only\nFigure 12. For two different years (1996 and 2007) and for two different GOES satellites (GOES\u2010East\nand GOES\u2010West), 500 point running averages of the magnetic field stretching angle at geosynchronous\norbit versus local time are plotted. To make the running averages, 1 min time resolution measurements\nwere plotted versus local time.\nFigure 13. Using measurements from five GOES satellites\nduring 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, the superposed\naverage of the magnetic field stretching angle at geosyn-\nchronous orbit (color) is plotted as a function of time from\nstorm onset (horizontal axis) and local time (vertical axis).\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n15 of 35\nabout 3, indicating that the strong\u2010stretching phase is more\nrobust for \u0002 than it is for Dst*.\n[56] To get a measure of what fraction of Dst* is owed to\ntail currents, the linear fits for the modest\u2010stretching decay\nof Dst* are subtracted off of Dst* at all times and the results\nare called Dst*tail for the four Dst* curves. These four\nDst*tail curves are plotted in Figure 16 (top). As can be seen,\ndepending on the coefficients used to correct Dst for solar\nwind ram pressure, various estimates are obtained of how\nstrong the tail current contribution to Dst is for high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms. This is because the tail current phase\n(the strong\u2010stretching phase) of a high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorm occurs at a time when the solar wind ram pressure is\nhigh, and the resulting Dst* depends on the strength of that\ncorrection. Examining the blue curve in Figures 16 (top) and\n15, without the subtraction, the peak negative value is Dst* =\n\u221243 nT and, with the subtraction, the peak negative value is\nDst*tail = \u22129 nT. Hence, the \u201cstrong\u2010stretching\u201d contribution\nto Dst* is 9\/43 \u2248 21% of the value of Dst. To determine the\nfractional contribution of the tail current to Dst*, the four\nDst*tail curves in Figure 16 (top) are divided by the original\nDst* curves and the resulting four ratios are plotted (in\npercent) in Figure 16 (bottom). The peak values of the ratios\nare indicated for each curve. As can be seen, depending on\nthe coefficients used to make Dst* from Dst, the estimate\ndiffers. For the four sets of coefficients used, the estimated\nfraction of Dst* that is owed to tail currents varies from 15%\nto 37% for high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. The 15% esti-\nmate comes from aDst* that definitely has an undercorrection\nfor the pressure (see the green curve in Figure 4 with a pos-\nitive slope in Dst* prior to storm onset). The 37% estimate\ncomes from aDst* that probably has an overcorrection for the\npressure (see the red curve in Figure 4). The blue curve in the\nFigure 16 (bottom), which is generated with the Dst* given by\nexpressions (1) probably has the most accurate pressure\ncorrection: this curve yields an estimate that the tail currents\ncontribute about 22% to the Dst* index for high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms. This 20%\u201325% value agrees with\nsome previous estimates for storms [e.g., Turner et al., 2000;\nOhtani et al., 2001] and the full range of 15%\u201337% values are\nless than other previous estimates for storms [e.g., Alexeev\net al., 1996; Alexeev and Feldstein, 2001; Skoug et al., 2003;\nKalegaev et al., 2005; Kalegaev and Makarenkov, 2008].\nNote, however, that most other estimates pertain to CME\u2010\ndriven storms.\n6. Hot Plasma During the Storms\n[57] To discern the connection between the hot plasma in\nthe magnetosphere and the behavior of the magnetospheric\nmagnetic field during high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms,\nMPA measurements [Bame et al., 1993] of the plasmas at\ngeosynchronous orbit are examined for the same 63 storms\nthat were examined in sections 4 and 5 and the temporal\nFigure 14. Superposed averages are plotted for 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. The magnetic field\nstretching angle at geosynchronous orbit as measured by five GOES satellites is plotted in the noon sector\n(black), the dusk sector (blue), the dawn sector (green), and the midnight sector (red). The thin curves are\n6 h running averages and the thick curves are 24 h running averages.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n16 of 35\nbehavior of the magnetic field is compared with the tem-\nporal behavior of the hot plasma.\n[58] In Figure 17, the superposed average of the hot ion\ndensity, temperature, and pressure (left column) and of the\nhot electron density, temperature, and pressure (right column)\nare plotted as functions of time during the storms (horizontal\naxis) and local time (vertical axis). The zero epoch in the plots\nof Figure 17 is the time of storm onset. As can be seen, the\nsuperdense plasma sheet (top row) commences prior to storm\nonset and lasts about 1 day [cf. Denton and Borovsky, 2009]\nand the extra hot plasma sheet (second row) commences\nnear storm onset and lasts for several days [cf. Denton and\nBorovsky, 2009]. As can be discerned, the superdense\nplasma sheet is strongest on the nightside and weaker on the\ndayside.\n[59] In Figure 18, the superposed average of the stretching\nangle \u0002 of the magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit on the\nnightside (20\u20133 LT) as measured by the GOES spacecraft\nfor the 63 storms is plotted (black curve, left axis) as a\nfunction of time during the storm. The zero epoch of the plot\n(vertical dashed line) is storm onset. Also plotted in Figure 18\nis the superposed average of the particle pressure of the ion\nplasma sheet on the nightside (21\u20133 LT) of geosynchronous\norbit (blue curve, right axis). The ion pressure is only\nmeasured in the MPA range of energies (<40 keV), and so\nthe plotted pressure underestimates the full ion pressure by\nabout a factor of 2 [cf. Borovsky et al., 1998a]. As can be\nseen in Figure 18, the temporal profiles of the nightside\nstretching and the nightside hot ion pressure are similar. A\nlinear regression fit of the measured stretching angle \u0002 and\nthe measured MPA ion pressure PMPA is made for the time\ninterval from 3 days prior to storm onset to 3 days after onset\nand the linear fit is\n\u0002 \u00bc 68\u0003 \u0002 15:9\u0003 PMPA; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere the MPA\u2010measured ion pressure PMPA is in units of\nnPa. Expression (3) is plotted as the dashed green curve\n(right axis) in Figure 18; as can be seen, this function has a\ntime profile very similar to the time profile of the nightside\nstretching angle. Because the high particle pressure of the\nsuperdense ion plasma sheet and the strong stretching of the\nnightside magnetic field coincide in time, one suspects that\nthe superdense plasma sheet is responsible for the enhanced\nstretching of the nightside magnetic field in the early phase\nof high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. (Note that the super-\ndense plasma sheet is in turn caused by the compressed\nhigh\u2010density solar wind of the CIR [Denton and Borovsky,\n2009].) In Figure 18, the number density of the ion\nplasma sheet in the midnight sector is also plotted (orange):\nnote the time lag between the profile of the number density\nand the profile of the pressure. This time lag is owed to the\nfact that the temperature of the ion plasma sheet temporally\nincreases across the superdense plasma sheet phase.\n[60] During the declining phase of the solar cycle, it has\nbeen shown that the stretching angle of the magnetic field\nat geosynchronous orbit on the nightside is correlated with\nthe ion plasma pressure in the nightside magnetosphere\n[Borovsky et al., 1998a]. Figure 19 [after Borovsky et al.,\n1998a, Figure 18] plots the stretching angle \u0002 at local mid-\nFigure 15. For the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms the temporal profile of the Dst* index is com-\npared with the temporal profile of nightside stretching. The 12 h running average of the superposed aver-\nage of the magnetic field stretching angle \u0002 in the midnight sector of geosynchronous orbit as measured by\nfive GOES satellites is plotted (black curve, left axis) as a function of time from storm onset. The 12 h run-\nning average of the superposed average of Dst* (20.7, 27.7) (from expression (1)) is also plotted (blue\ncurve, right axis). For the two curves, linear regression fits to their fast\u2010decay portions and their slow\u2010\ndecay portions are plotted as the line segments. The slopes of the line segments are indicated. The time of\nstorm onset is indicated by the vertical dashed line.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n17 of 35\nnight as a function of the hot ion pressure at local midnight.\nFor Figure 19, the hot ion pressure was measured by com-\nbiningMPA (0 eV to 40 keV) and Synchronous Orbit Particle\nAnalyzer (SOPA) (50 keV to 2 MeV) measurements [Belian\net al., 1996; Cayton and Belian, 2007] of the thermal and\nsuprathermal ions of the ion plasma sheet for the single\nspacecraft 1989\u2010046 during November, December, and\nJanuary of 1993\u20131994. This MPA\u2010SOPA combination pro-\nvides a more complete measurement of the total ion pressure\nthan the MPA\u2010only measurement of Figure 18. In Figure 19,\nthe stretching angle of the magnetic field is determined from\nthe symmetry axis of the three\u2010dimensional ion and electron\ndistribution functions as measured by the MPA detector\n[Thomsen et al., 1996, 1999]. The stretching angle and the ion\npressure are determined at the same time at the same location.\nFigure 19 plots one data point per spacecraft crossing of local\nFigure 16. In the top, the slow\u2010decay fits are subtracted from the four different Dst* curves to obtain\nfour Dst*tail curves. In the bottom, the ratio Dst*tail\/Dst* is plotted (in percent). The peak value of the\nratio during the storm is indicated for each of the four methods for obtaining Dst*. The Dst* from expres-\nsion (1) is the blue curve.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n18 of 35\nmidnight for 3 months during which recurring high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms occurred. As can be seen, there is a\ndefinite statistical trend wherein the nightside magnetic field\nis more stretched (smaller \u0002 values) when the ion pressure is\nhigher. For the data plotted, the linear correlation coefficient\nbetween the stretching angle \u0002 and the logarithm of the ion\npressure is Rcorr = 0.76. Figure 19 lends credence to the\ninterpretation that the enhanced nightside stretching in the\nearly portions of high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms is caused\nby the increased particle pressure of the superdense plasma\nsheet, which makes its appearance early in high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms. Earlier studies [Denton and Borovsky,\nFigure 17. For 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, superposed averages of MPA measurements are\nplotted: in the left column, the density, temperature, and pressure of the hot ions (0.1\u201345 keV) around\ngeosynchronous orbit, and in the right column, the density, temperature, and pressure of the hot electrons\n(0.03\u201345 keV) around geosynchronous orbit. In each plot, the horizontal axis is time from storm onset and\nthe vertical axis is local time.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n19 of 35\n2009] have shown that the superdense plasma sheet is owed to\nthe compressed high\u2010density solar wind of the CIR.\n7. The Outer Electron Radiation Belt During\nthe Storms\n[61] To discern the connection between the morphology\nof the magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit and the\ndynamics of the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchro-\nnous orbit during high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, SOPA\nand ESP [Cayton et al., 1989; Meier et al., 1996; Cayton\nand Belian, 2007] measurements of the energetic electrons\nat geosynchronous orbit are analyzed for the 63 storms of\ninterest. One important phenomena that commonly occurs\nduring high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms is the dropout of the\nrelativistic electrons at geosynchronous orbit [Freeman,\n1964; Nagai, 1988; Borovsky et al., 1998a; Blake et al.,\n2001]. This dropout occurs early in the storm and has been\nassociated with the superdense plasma sheet [Borovsky et al.,\n1998a; Borovsky and Denton, 2009c] and with magnetic field\nstretching at geosynchronous orbit [Onsager et al., 2002,\n2007; Green et al., 2004].\n7.1. Temporal Connections Between Radiation Belt\nDynamics and Magnetic Field Evolution\n[62] In Figure 20, SOPA and ESP measurements of the\nenergetic electrons at geosynchronous orbit are used to\nproduce superposed averages of three quantities for the\n63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. In Figure 20 (top), the\nlogarithm of the omnidirectional flux of 1.1\u20131.5 MeV elec-\ntrons is plotted. The horizontal axis is the time from storm\nonset, and the vertical axis is local time. As can be seen, the\nfluxes are systematically higher at local noon and lower on\nthe nightside. In the days prior to storm onset the geosyn-\nchronous flux slowly decays [see also Borovsky and\nSteinberg, 2006; Meredith et al., 2006; Borovsky and\nDenton, 2009b]. Near the time of storm onset, the flux de-\ncreases rapidly (onset of dropout), and the flux remains low\nfor about 1 day. Then the flux recovers (recovery from\ndropout), and finally, the flux slowly increases in the several\ndays after storm onset. Relativistic Maxwellian distributions\nare fit to the SOPA and ESP measurements [Cayton et al.,\n1989; Cayton and Belian, 2007], yielding temperatures\nand densities for the radiation belt population; typical\nnumber densities of the outer electron radiation belt at\ngeosynchronous orbit are about 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22123 and typical\ntemperatures are about 140 keV [Denton et al., 2009c]. In\nthe second and third panels of Figure 20, the superposed\naverages of the logarithm of the number density and of the\ntemperature of the outer electron radiation belt at geosyn-\nchronous orbit are plotted versus time from storm onset\n(horizontal) and versus local time (vertical). Examining the\nsecond panel, it is seen that the number density is system-\natically higher on the dayside of geosynchronous orbit than\nFigure 18. For the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, the 24 h running average of the superposed\naverage of the magnetic field stretching angle \u0002 in the midnight sector of geosynchronous orbit as mea-\nsured by five GOES satellites is plotted (black curve, left axis) as a function of time from storm onset. The\nsuperposed average of the hot ion pressure PMPA in the MPA range (0\u201340 keV) is also plotted (blue curve,\nright axis), as is the hot ion density nMPA (orange curve, right axis). Expression (3) is plotted in green\nusing PMPA from the blue curve.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n20 of 35\nit is on the nightside. As can be seen, the number density\nslowly decreases with time in the days prior to storm onset,\nthe number density drops strongly at storm onset (onset\nof dropout), the number density then rapidly increases\n(recovery from dropout) a fraction of a day after dropping\nout, and then the number density is approximately constant\nfor the several days after storm onset. Examining the third\npanel of Figure 20, it is seen that the temperature of the outer\nelectron radiation belt is constant in the days prior to storm\nonset, the temperature drops near storm onset and then in-\ncreases slowly in the days following storm onset. This slow\nincrease in the electron radiation belt temperature at fixed\nnumber density produces the steady strong increase in the\nrelativistic electron flux during the several day long high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms [Borovsky et al., 1998a].\n[63] In Figure 21, the temporal evolution of the outer\nelectron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit is compared\nwith the changes in the morphology of the geosynchronous\nmagnetic field for the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms.\nIn Figure 21 (top), the superposed average of the magnetic\nfield strength in the noon sector of geosynchronous orbit is\nplotted as a function of time, with the zero epoch (vertical\ndashed line) being the time of storm onset. The plotted curve\nis a 24 h running average. The compression of the dayside\nmagnetic field is seen as the perturbation centered in time\napproximately at storm onset. In the second panel of\nFigure 21, the superposed average of the stretching angle of\nthe magnetic field in the midnight sector of geosynchronous\norbit is plotted. The plotted curve is a 24 h running average.\nAs can be seen, the strong\u2010stretching phase peaks almost\none half day after storm onset. In the third panel, the local\ntime average of the superposed average of the logarithm of\nFigure 19. Using data from Figure 18 of Borovsky et al.\n[1998a], the magnetic field stretching angle \u0002 in the mid-\nnight sector of geosynchronous orbit is plotted as a function\nof the MPA + SOPA ion pressure Pi in that sector. One data\npoint is plotted per crossing of midnight (one per day) for\n3 months during repeating high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms.\nThe linear correlation coefficient between \u0002 and log(Pi) is\n+0.76.\nFigure 20. Using SOPA and ESP measurements at geosyn-\nchronous orbit, superposed averages of (top) the outer elec-\ntron radiation belt 1.1\u20131.5 MeV flux, (middle) number\ndensity, and (bottom) temperature are plotted for the 63\nhigh\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. Averaged values of these\nparameters at 1 hr time resolution are displayed for \u00b15 days\nfrom the zero epoch of convection onset. In the top, the flux\nunits are cm\u22122 keV\u22121 ster\u22121 s\u22121.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n21 of 35\nthe omnidirectional flux of 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electrons at geo-\nsynchronous orbit is plotted. In the fourth through seventh\npanels of Figure 21, the local time average of the superposed\naverages of several quantities is plotted: the logarithm of the\nnumber density n of the outer electron radiation belt at\ngeosynchronous orbit, the temperature T of the outer elec-\ntron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit, the energy\ndensity E (=nkBT) of the outer electron radiation belt at\ngeosynchronous orbit, and the specific entropy S (=T\/n2\/3)\nof the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit.\nAs can be seen by comparing the third panel with the second\npanel, the temporal evolution of the relativistic electron flux\nresembles the temporal profile of the nightside stretching; in\nparticular, the relativistic electron flux dropout occurs dur-\ning the increase in the strong stretching and the relativistic\nelectron flux recovery occurs as the strong stretching sub-\nsides. This temporal connection between magnetic field\nstretching and electron flux dropouts has been reported\nbefore [e.g., Onsager et al., 2002, 2007; Green et al., 2004].\nThe relativistic electron flux is a function of the number\ndensity of the electrons and the temperature of the electrons\n[Cayton and Belian, 2007] and the dropout of the electron\nflux need not be the same as the dropout of the electron\ndensity. Note in the fourth panel of Figure 21 that the dropout\nin the number density occurs earlier than the dropout in the\nflux [see alsoDenton et al., 2009c]; the number density of the\nouter electron radiation belt has a dropout occurring during\nthe beginning of the strong\u2010stretching phase with a recovery\nthat commences before the strong\u2010stretching phase reaches\nits peak. Note also that the number density dropout fully\nrecovers before the strong\u2010stretching phase ends. This\ncomparison of the temporal profile of the number density\nwith the temporal profile of the field stretching implies that\nthe recovery of the outer electron radiation belt from dropout\nis not associated with the relaxation of stretching of the\nmagnetospheric magnetic field.\n[64] In Figure 21 (bottom), the local time average of the\nsuperposed average of the specific entropy S = T\/n2\/3 of the\nouter electron radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit is\nplotted. Note that the radiation belt dropout appears as a\nbrief strong increase in the specific entropy; the strong\nincrease in entropy is caused by a sudden drop in the density\nn of the outer electron radiation belt and a sudden decrease\nin the temperature of the outer electron radiation belt. The\nsubsequent sudden strong drop in the specific entropy is\nassociated with a sudden increase in the number density n of\nthe outer electron radiation belt; this is the sudden \u201crecovery\nfrom dropout\u201d of the radiation belt electrons. The calcula-\nFigure 21.

The black vertical dashed line is storm onset.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n22 of 35\ntion of the specific entropy S = T\/n2\/3 in time series data has\nproven to be a powerful method of discerning different\nplasmas [e.g., Burlaga et al., 1990; Siscoe and Intriligator,\n1993; Crooker et al., 1996; Borovsky et al., 1998c; Burton\net al., 1999; Osherovich et al., 1999; Lazarus et al., 2003;\nNeugebauer et al., 2004; Pagel et al., 2004; Borovsky, 2008;\nJohnson and Wing, 2009]. Note in Figure 21 (bottom) that\nthe specific entropy is different after the recovery (at about\nt = +0.5 days) than it was prior to dropout (at about t =\n\u22121 days): this entropy difference implies that the popu-\nlation of radiation belt electrons after recovery is a different\npopulation from the population before dropout [see also\nBorovsky et al., 1998a], precluding the adiabatic \u201cDst effect\u201d\n[e.g.,Dessler and Karplus, 1961;Kim and Chan, 1997] as the\ncause of the dropout.\n7.2. Electron Loss by Magnetopause Shadowing\n[65] An outstanding issue in our attempt to understand the\nradiation belts is the cause of the relativistic electron dropout\n[Friedel et al., 2002; Kavanagh and Denton, 2007]: spe-\ncifically whether the electrons are lost to the atmosphere or\nto the magnetopause. Borovsky and Denton [2009c] found\na temporal association between relativistic electron flux\ndropouts and the occurrence of the superdense plasma sheet\nin the presence of the plasmaspheric drainage plume: this\nassociation fits a scenario in which the superdense plasma\nsheet drives plasma waves, which scatter the radiation belt\nelectrons into the atmospheric loss cone. On the contrary,\nrecent calculations [Desorgher et al., 2000; Ukhorskiy et al.,\n2006; Kim et al., 2008] have indicated that distortion of the\nmagnetosphere during geomagnetic storms can cause radi-\nation belt electrons to drift into the dayside magnetopause to\nbe lost. And recent computer simulations have indicated that\nradial diffusion is important in the outer electron radiation\nbelt [e.g., Brautigam and Albert, 2000; Miyoshi et al., 2003;\nJordanova et al., 2008], which could enhance the losses to\nthe magnetopause.\n[66] In Figure 22, the possibility that the dropout is caused\nby the loss of radiation belt electrons to the magnetopause is\nexplored for high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. In Figure 22\n(top), the superposed average of the logarithm of the number\ndensity of the outer electron radiation belt in the noon sector\n(blue) and midnight sector (red) at geosynchronous orbit is\nplotted as a function of time for the 63 storms, with the zero\nepoch (vertical dashed line) being the onset of storm con-\nvection. In the second panel, the superposed average of the\nlogarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV omnidirectional electron flux\nin the noon sector (blue) and in the midnight sector (red)\nis plotted for the 63 storms. In Figure 22 (bottom), the\nsuperposed average of the magnetic field strength in the\nnoon sector (blue) and in the midnight sector (red) of geo-\nsynchronous orbit is plotted for the 63 storms. As can be\nseen, the field strength at noon is stronger than the field\nstrength at midnight. Also plotted in Figure 22 (bottom) is\nan estimate of the magnetic field strength at the dayside\nmagnetopause Bmp at local noon. This estimate is calculated\nfrom the superposed average of the solar wind ram pressure\nrv2 (including the number density of alpha particles in the\nsolar wind) via the pressure balance argument Krv2 = Bmp\n2 \/\n8p, where K is an aerodynamic factor accounting for the\ndivergence of the solar wind flow near the stagnation point.\nTaking the high Mach number value K = 0.88 [Spreiter et al.,\n1966; Schield, 1969], the pressure balance argument yields\nBmp = 47 nT (rv\n2)1\/2 where rv2 is in units of nPa. Using the\nsuperposed average of rv2 from the fifth panel of Figure 1, the\nblack dashed curve in Figure 22 (bottom) is plotted.\n[67] Equatorially mirroring energetic particles in the\nmagnetosphere drift on orbits with constant magnetic field\nstrength [Hones, 1963]. If the equatorial magnetic field\nstrength on the nightside were 90 nT, then energetic electrons\nwould drift around the Earth in an orbit where B = 90 nT\neverywhere. If the magnetic field strength at the magneto-\npause were 90 nT or stronger, then those nightside electrons\nwould drift into the magnetopause on the dayside and be lost\nfrom the magnetosphere. (The depletion of particles within\nthe magnetosphere owing to this effect is known as \u201cmag-\nnetopause shadowing.\u201d) Owing to their off magnetic equator\nlocations, the GOES satellites do not measure the equatorial\nfield strength, rather they overestimate the equatorial\nstrength. Hence, in Figure 22 (bottom), the midnight field\nstrength at the equator is lower than \u223c90 nT. The magne-\ntopause magnetic field strength (black dashed curve) in\nFigure 22 (bottom) begins to increase about half a day prior\nto storm onset and the curve crosses the 90 nT value a few\nhours before storm onset. A corresponding temporal behavior\ncan be found in the decrease of the midnight number\ndensity of the outer electron radiation belt (Figure 22, top)\nand in the decrease of the relativistic electron flux at mid-\nnight (Figure 22, second panel). One would expect that as\nlong as the black curve in Figure 22 (bottom) was above the\nred curve, the midnight density of the outer electron radia-\ntion belt should remain low since these orbits remain\nconnected to the magnetopause. Such a behavior is seen in\nthe midnight flux (Figure 22, second) but not in the midnight\ndensity (Figure 22, top). Hence, there is some discrepancy\nbetween the magnetopause\u2010shadowing argument and the\nnightside outer electron radiation belt observations.\n[68] The above argument was made for equatorially mir-\nroring electrons (with equatorial pitch angles of 90\u00b0). For\nelectrons at midnight with equatorial pitch angles less than\n90\u00b0 the affect of magnetopause shadowing is lessened.\nOwing to shell splitting [Fairfield, 1964; Roederer, 1967],\nthe orbits of nightside particles with smaller pitch angles do\nnot move out as far on the dayside as do 90\u00b0 particles. It is\nwell anticipated that magnetopause shadowing will produce\ncharacteristic features in the pitch angle distributions of\nnightside electrons [e.g.,West et al., 1973; Fritz et al., 2003]\nsince 90\u00b0 electrons are more readily lost. More information\nabout the role of magnetopause shadowing in producing the\ndropouts of the outer electron radiation belt during high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms awaits a future analysis of pitch\nangle distribution measurements with superposed\u2010epoch\ntechniques.\n[69] There is another discrepancy between the magneto-\npause shadowing argument and the outer electron radiation\nbelt observations. This discrepancy pertains to the electron\nobservations in the noon sector. Note in the first and second\npanels of Figure 22 that dropouts of the number density and\nflux occur at noon and that these dropouts are fractionally as\nlarge as the dropouts seen at midnight and they have almost\nidentical temporal profiles. Yet the geosynchronous sa-\ntellites measuring the energetic electrons at noon are within\nthe magnetosphere and so the orbits of these electrons are\nnot encountering the dayside magnetopause. Hence, there is\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n23 of 35\na dropout without magnetopause shadowing and that drop-\nout looks very much like the nightside dropout. Unless\nradial diffusion to the magnetopause is invoked [e.g.,\nShprits et al., 2006], some other loss mechanism must be\nacting to produce the dropout. In Figure 22 (bottom),\nmagnetic field strength at noon is plotted (blue): the value is\nB > 120 nT during the solar wind pressure pulse. In the\ndipolar dayside field, the GOES spacecrafts do not strongly\nunderestimate the equatorial field strength, so B \u223c 120 nT is\nprobably accurate. In Figure 22 (bottom), the black dashed\ncurve representing the calculated value of the magnetopause\nmagnetic field strength does not reach 120 nT, but it does\ncome within \u223c10% of 120 nT. Hence, at times the magne-\ntopause could be close to geosynchronous orbit and perhaps\nradial diffusion to the magnetopause could be very fast and\nvery efficient.\nFigure 22. Superposed averages of various quantities are plotted for the 63 storms. In the top, the SOPA\nand ESP measurements of number density of the outer electron radiation belt at geosynchronous are plot-\nted in the noon sector (blue) and the midnight sector (red). In the second panel, SOPA measurements of\nthe 1.1\u20131.5 MeV omnidirectional electron flux at geosynchronous orbit are plotted for the noon sector\n(blue) and midnight sector (red). In the bottom, GOES measurements of the magnetic field strength at\ngeosynchronous orbit are plotted for the noon sector (blue) and midnight sector (red). Also plotted is\nthe magnetopause magnetic field strength predicted from the solar wind ram pressure.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n24 of 35\n[70] From the observations collected into Figure 22, it\nseems likely that magnetopause shadowing plays some role\nin the dropout of the outer electron radiation belt at geo-\nsynchronous orbit during high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms,\nalthough there are some discrepancies with the temporal\nprofiles. Outstanding questions are (1) how big the role of\nmagnetopause shadowing in producing the dropout is and\n(2) how the recovery operate. For these high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms, future analyses of pitch angle measurements\nare needed to provide further information.\n8. Temporal Variations of the Geosynchronous\nMagnetic Field During the Storms\n[71] Temporal fluctuations in the magnetic field at geo-\nsynchronous orbit are of interest for their ability to drive\nradial diffusion of energetic electrons in the magnetosphere\n[F\u00e4lthammar, 1965; Perry et al., 2005; Shprits et al., 2008]\nand for their ability to energize the outer electron radiation\nbelt [Rostoker et al., 1998; Mathie and Mann, 2000;\nElkington et al., 2003], which are especially relevant during\nhigh\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms [Paulikas and Blake, 1976;\nLove et al., 2000; Wrenn et al., 2002]. In this section, 1 min\nchanges in the magnetic field vector at geosynchronous orbit\nare calculated and investigated during high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms via superposed\u2010epoch analysis. The quantity\ninvestigated is the magnitude dB of the 1 min change in the\nmagnetic field vector dB, where dB(t) = B(t + 1 min) \u2212 B(t)\nis the 1 min change in the vector and dB = \u2223dB\u2223 = (dBx2 + dBy2 +\ndBz\n2)1\/2 is the magnitude of the change. The normalized\nquantity dB\/B will also be examined, where the denominator\nB is the magnetic field strength. No attention will be paid to\nthe polarization of the field changes nor to whether the\nchanges are poloidal, toroidal, or compressive [e.g., Saito,\n1969; McPherron et al., 1972; Orr, 1973].\n[72] In Figure 23 (top), the superposed average of dB\nduring the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms is plotted\n(color) as a function of the time from storm onset (horizontal\naxis) and the local time of the observing GOES satellite\n(vertical axis). Blue indicates low levels of fluctuations\n(\u223c0.5 nT over 1 min), and red indicates higher levels of\nfluctuations (\u223c2.5 nT over 1 min). As can be seen, the\namplitude of the magnetic field fluctuations is weak prior to\nstorm onset and the amplitude increases suddenly at storm\nonset. (This increase in magnetic fluctuation amplitude at\ngeosynchronous orbit at the onset of high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms has been reported by Takahashi and Ukhorskiy\n[2008].) As the storm progresses, the amplitude of the mag-\nnetic field fluctuations dB decreases with time. During the\nstorm, the amplitude of dB at geosynchronous orbit is highest\nin the dusk sector and lowest prenoon. The dusk sector\nmaximum of ULF power during the declining\u2010phase geo-\nmagnetic storms has been reported in the literature [Anderson\net al., 1990; Sanny et al., 2007].\n[73] In Figure 23 (bottom), the superposed average of the\nnormalized amplitude dB\/B of the magnetic field fluctua-\ntions during the 63 storms is plotted as functions of the time\nfrom storm onset (horizontal axis) and local time (vertical\naxis). The normalized amplitude dB\/B is weak before the\nstorm, increases sharply at all local times at storm onset, and\ndecays with time slowly during the storm. During the storm\nand before, the normalized amplitude is highest in the dusk\u2010\nmidnight sector and weakest prenoon.\n[74] In Figure 24, the superposed average of the normal-\nized amplitude dB\/B of magnetic field temporal variation at\ngeosynchronous orbit is plotted as a function of time from\nstorm onset. The four curves are the amplitude in the dawn\nsector (3\u20139 LT), noon sector (9\u201315 LT), dusk sector (15\u2013\n21 LT), and the midnight sector (21\u20133 LT). All four curves\nare 12 h running averages of the superposed average. Note\nthat the vertical axis is logarithmic. Again, it is seen that the\nnormalized amplitude dB\/B is weak before the storm, in-\ncreases rapidly at storm onset, and decays steadily as the\nstorm progresses. Before and during the storm, the nor-\nmalized amplitude dB\/B is distinctly larger in the dusk and\nmidnight sectors than it is in the dawn and noon sectors.\nNote in Figure 24 that the superposed average of the\namplitude dB\/B decreases steadily with time in the days\nFigure 23. Using measurements from five GOES satellites\nduring 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, the superposed\naverage of the magnitude of the 1 min change dB of the\nmagnetic field vector at geosynchronous orbit is plotted in\nthe top and the superposed average of the normalized mag-\nnitude of the 1 min change dB\/B of the magnetic field vector\nat geosynchronous orbit is plotted in the bottom. In each\npanel, the horizontal axis is the time from storm onset and\nthe vertical axis is local time).\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n25 of 35\nbefore storm onset. It is believed that this decreasing\namplitude is owed to the occurrence of calms before the\nstorms [Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006] of varying durations,\nwith the amplitude of dB\/B being low in each calm: closer to\nstorm onset, the probability of being in a storm is greater.\n[75] In Figure 25, the local time dependence of the super-\nposed average of the normalized amplitude of fluctuation\ndB\/B is examined in detail. The black curve in Figure 25 is the\naverage amplitude dB\/B during the day prior to the storm\n(averaged from time \u221224 h to time 0 h) plotted as a function\nof local time. The red curve is the average amplitude dB\/B\nduring day 1 of the storm (from time 0 h to time 24 h), the\nblue curve is the average amplitude during day 2 of the\nstorm, and the green curve is the average amplitude during\nday 3 of the storm. Note that the vertical axis is logarithmic.\nAs can be seen, for each of the 4 days plotted in Figure 25\nthe normalized amplitude dB\/B is highest in the dusk\u2010\nmidnight sector and quietest in the dawn\u2010noon sector. Note\nthat in the day before the storm (black curve) the peak in\namplitude is relatively narrow, centered at about midnight;\nduring the storm, this peak in amplitude broadens into the\ndusk sector. This midnight peak during quiet times and the\nduskward broadening during high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorms has been observed by Sanny et al. [2007].\n[76] Note that the temporal profiles of the superposed\naverage of the normalized amplitude dB\/B in Figure 24\nresemble the temporal profiles of the Kp index and the PCI\nindex (second and fourth panels of Figure 2). An overlay of\nthe dB\/B curves and the index curves finds remarkable sim-\nilarities in temporal behaviors for the high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven\nstorms. In the three panels of Figure 26, the 12 h smoothed\nsuperposed average of dB\/B in the dusk sector (15\u201321 LT) is\nplotted as functions of three geomagnetic indices: (top) Kp,\n(middle) PCI, and (bottom) MBI. The plots of Figure 26\nutilize hourly data points from 7 days prior to the storm\nonset to 7 days after onset. The linear correlation coefficients\nRcorr are indicated in each of the three panels. In the three\npanels linear regression fits to the data are plotted as the red\nlines and the linear regression formula for each line is\nindicated in each panel. These fits for the dusk sector dB\/B\nare\n\u0003B=B \u00bc 0:68 Kp\u0002 0:50; \u00f04a\u00de\n\u0003B=B \u00bc 1:31 PCI\u0002 0:26; \u00f04b\u00de\n\u0003B=B \u00bc 37\u0002 0:57 MBI: \u00f04c\u00de\nFor the behavior of dB\/B before and during high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms, expressions (4) are parameterizations\nof the dusk sector dB\/B in terms of the three geomagnetic\nindices Kp, PCI, and MBI. Expressions (4) are most accurate\nbefore the storms and in the latter days of the storms. In\nFigure 26, data points pertaining to day 1 of the high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms are indicated in the three panels: as can\nFigure 24. Using measurements from five GOES satellites during 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms,\n12 h running averages of the superposed average of the normalized magnitude of the 1 min change dB\/B\nof the magnetic field vector at geosynchronous orbit is plotted for the noon sector (black curve), the dawn\nsector (green curve), the midnight sector (red curve), and the dusk sector (blue curve).\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n26 of 35\nbe seen, these data points deviate from the linear regression\nfits. These data points are from the time when the magnetic\nfield in the nightside magnetosphere undergoes strong\nstretching (cf. Figure 14). Particularly noticeable in the MBI\npanel (bottom) of Figure 26, the data points corresponding\nto the rapid rise in dB\/B at storm onset also deviate from the\nlinear regression trend; these data are also from the strong\u2010\nstretching phase early in the storm. As can be seen by\nexamining the three panels of Figure 26, these data points\nfrom the strong\u2010stretching era (from day 1 of the storm and\nfrom the ramp up of dB\/B near storm onset) could be fit\nseparately with a linear regression: a line parallel to the\nplotted lines would result but with dB\/B increased by a factor\nof about 1.4 for all three panels of Figure 26. This deviation\nfrom the linear regression trend during the strong\u2010stretching\nFigure 25. Using measurements from five GOES satellites\nduring 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, 1 day averages\nof the superposed average of the normalized magnitude of\nthe 1 min change dB\/B of the magnetic field vector at geo-\nsynchronous orbit is plotted as a function of local time. The\nblack curve is the daily average for the day prior to storm\nonset (0\u201324 h prior to storm onset). The red curve is the\ndaily average for the first day of the storm (0\u201324 h after\nstorm onset). The blue curve is the daily average for the sec-\nond day of the storm (24\u201348 h after onset). The green curve\nis the daily average for the third day of the storm (48\u201372 h after\nonset).\nFigure 26. For 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, the\n12 h running average of the superposed average of the nor-\nmalized amplitude dB\/B of the 1 min magnetic vector\nchanges in the dusk sector of geosynchronous orbit are plot-\nted as functions of (top) the superposed average of the Kp\nindex, (middle) the polar cap index, and (bottom) the mid-\nnight boundary index. The data are from 7 days prior to\nstorm onset to 7 days after onset.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n27 of 35\nphase is most prominent in the dusk and midnight sectors.\nAt this time, the reason for the stronger dB\/B amplitude\nrelative to the strength of the geomagnetic indices during the\nstrong\u2010stretching phase of the magnetosphere is not known.\n9. Discussion: The Magnetospheric Magnetic\nField and the Solar Wind\n[77] To put the dayside compression and nightside\nstretching of the geosynchronous magnetic field into per-\nspective during the sequence of events of high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven magnetic storms, the timing of the geosyn-\nchronous magnetic perturbations relative to the sequence of\nevents in the solar wind associated with the passage of a\nCIR is explored in section 9.1. A related matter, the ease or\ndifficulty of describing the geosynchronous magnetic field\nperturbations in terms of upstream solar wind parameters, is\ndiscussed in section 9.2.\n9.1. Timing of the Magnetic Field Perturbations\nRelative to Solar Wind Timing and Other\nMagnetospheric Phenomena\n[78] In Figure 27, a corotating interaction region is\nsketched in the ecliptic plane at Earth\u2019s orbit [after Borovsky\nand Steinberg, 2006]. In Figure 27, the Earth\u2019s temporal\ntrack through the CIR is denoted as the green dashed arrow,\nand the temporal regions wherein the dayside magneto-\nsphere is compressed (red), wherein the nightside magneto-\nsphere undergoes strong stretching (blue), and wherein the\nnightside magnetosphere undergoes weak stretching (purple)\nare indicated along the Earth\u2019s track. Also indicated in the\nsketch are the stream interface separating the compressed\nslow wind from the compressed fast wind within the CIR,\nthe IMF sector reversal within the compressed slow wind,\nand the outer boundaries of the CIR (taken to be the width of\nthe compression region of the solar wind magnetic field or\nthe width of the region over which the solar wind speed\nchanges [Borovsky and Denton, 2009a]). The Earth begins\nits track (top to bottom) in slow solar wind (cool ions, lumpy\ndensity, low ion specific entropy), then encounters the onset\nof the CIR and enters into the compressed slow wind, then it\ncrosses the sector reversal within the compressed slow wind,\nthen encounters the stream interface and enters into com-\npressed fast wind, and finally crosses out of the CIR into\nunperturbed fast wind (hot ions, low density, high ion spe-\ncific entropy).\n9.1.1. Dayside Compression\n[79] Examining the dayside magnetosphere magnetic field\ncompression \u2223B\u2223 in Figure 8 (bottom, black curve) and\ncomparing that temporal pattern with the patterns of the\nsolar wind parameters in Figure 1, several details about\nthe timing of the dayside compression can be obtained. The\ndayside magnetic field compression is roughly coincident\nwith the solar wind density increase prior to and within the\nCIR. (This is exemplified more clearly in Figure 8, where\nthe temporal profile of the dayside field compression is\ncompared with the temporal profile of the solar wind ram\npressure, which is enhanced owing to an enhanced solar\nwind density.) The dayside compression perturbation begins\nwhen the Earth is in the slow solar wind before the onset of\nthe CIR and the compression perturbation \u2223B\u2223 is about at its\nmaximum when the Earth encounters the IMF sector\nreversal in the compressed slow wind. When the Earth en-\ncounters the CIR stream interface, the dayside compression\n\u2223B\u2223 is declining. The dayside compression ends during the\npassage of the compressed fast wind before the CIR is ex-\nited. These timing observations are entered into Table 1. As\nstated, the peak in the magnetospheric field compression\noccurs near the time of passage of the IMF sector reversal; this\npeak could be caused by noncompressive density enhance-\nments in the slow solar wind that are often associated with\nsector reversals [cf. Gosling et al., 1981; Borrini et al., 1981;\nCrooker et al., 1996, 2004a, 2004b; Blanco et al., 2006].\n9.1.2. Strong Nightside Stretching\n[80] Examining the stretching \u0002 of the nightside magnetic\nfield in Figure 14 (red curve) and comparing that temporal\npattern with the patterns of the solar wind parameters in\nFigure 1, several details about the timing of the nightside\nstretching can be obtained. The strong\u2010stretching perturba-\ntion \u0002 commences at about the time the Earth passes the IMF\nsector reversal and the stretching \u0002 peaks as the IMF Bz\n(GSM) is weakening. The strong\u2010stretching perturbation ends\nat about the time the Earth exits the CIR into the unperturbed\nfast wind. These timing observations are entered into Table 1.\nThe entire strong\u2010stretching perturbation of the nightside\nmagnetosphere is approximately coincident with the solar\nwind magnetic field compression, which denotes the major\nportion of the entire CIR. The strong nightside\u2010stretching\nperturbation commences after the dayside compression per-\nturbation commences, and the strong nightside\u2010stretching\nperturbation terminates after the dayside compression per-\nFigure 27. A sketch of a CIR (tan shading) and the Earth\u2019s\ntemporal track (green dashed arrow) through the CIR. The\ntemporal region on the time track where the dayside com-\npression of the magnetosphere occurs is labeled in red, the\ntemporal region on the time track where the strong nightside\nstretching occurs is labeled in blue, and the temporal region\non the time track where the weak nightside stretching occurs\nis labeled in purple.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n28 of 35\nturbation terminates. In section 6, it was seen that the timing\nof the strong nightside stretching perturbation was associated\nwith the timing of the superdense plasma sheet. It is reason-\nable to believe (e.g., Figures 18 and 19) that the strong\nnightside stretching early in the storm is associated with\ndiamagnetism from the high plasma pressure in the nightside\nmagnetosphere [cf. Borovsky et al., 1998a]. The higher\u2010than\u2010\nnormal plasma pressure comes with the superdense plasma\nsheet, which has its origin in the compressed slowwind of the\nCIR with a few hour time lag going from the solar wind to the\nnightside of geosynchronous orbit [Denton and Borovsky,\n2009].\n9.1.3. Weak Nightside Stretching\n[81] Examining the stretching \u0002 of the nightside magnetic\nfield in Figure 14 (red curve) and comparing that temporal\npattern with the patterns of the solar wind parameters in\nFigure 1, it is seen that there is a persistent (days) modest\nstretching to the magnetic field on the nightside when the\nEarth is in the fast wind after the passage of the CIR. This is\nentered into Table 1. It can be speculated that the long\u2010\nduration weak stretching is caused by long\u2010duration activity\ndriven by the fast solar wind, with no particular density\nfeature of the solar wind to blame.\n9.1.4. Dropout and Recovery of the Radiation Belt\n[82] In section 7, it was seen that the strong nightside\nstretching at geosynchronous orbit was temporally associated\nwith the dropout and recovery of the local time\u2010averaged\nrelativistic electron flux at geosynchronous orbit (see\nFigure 21). When the number density of the electron radi-\nation belt was examined, it was found that there was no clear\ntemporal association between the dropout and recovery of\nthe density and the strong nightside stretching. The relativistic\nelectron flux dropout and recovery also showed temporal\nassociation with the increase and decrease of the magneto-\npause magnetic field (as calculated from the increase and\ndecrease of the solar wind ram pressure), but again, the\nnumber density dropout and recovery lacked an unambiguous\ntemporal association with the magnetopause field strength.\n9.1.5. Heating of the Radiation Belt\n[83] In section 7, it was noted that the flux of relativistic\nelectrons in the outer electron radiation belt grows steadily\nin the days after storm onset (see Figure 21). This increase\nin flux is associated with a heating of the outer electron\nradiation belt during high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms. After\nrecovery of the radiation belt, this heating occurs during the\nweak\u2010stretching phase of the nightside magnetic field.\nDetermining the physical mechanisms that produce these\nincreasing fluxes of relativistic electrons during high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms is among the most important problems\nbeing studied in radiation belt physics [cf. Friedel et al.,\n2002; Hudson et al., 2008]. A causal connection between\nthe weak stretching and the heating of the outer electron\nradiation belt cannot be made at this time.\n[84] These observations about the timing of the magneto-\nspheric magnetic field perturbations during high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms are collected into the last column of\nTable 1. The other columns of Table 1 are assembled from\nobservations gleaned in previous superposed\u2010epoch in-\nvestigations of high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms [cf. Denton\net al., 2009c; Denton and Borovsky, 2009; Borovsky and\nDenton, 2009c].\nT\nab\nle\n1.\nT\nyp\nic\nal\nC\nhr\non\nol\nog\ny\nof\na\nR\nec\nur\nri\nng\nH\nig\nh\u2010\nS\npe\ned\nS\ntr\nea\nm\nC\nyc\nle\nan\nd\nth\ne\nR\nes\nul\ntin\ng\nG\neo\nm\nag\nne\ntic\nA\nct\niv\nity\n,\nB\neh\nav\nio\nr\nof\nth\ne\nE\nar\nth\n\u2019s\nP\nla\nsm\na\nS\nhe\net\n,\nB\neh\nav\nio\nr\nof\nth\ne\nD\nra\nin\nag\ne\nP\nlu\nm\nes\n,\nP\nha\nse\nof\nth\ne\nR\nel\nat\niv\nis\ntic\nE\nle\nct\nro\nn\nD\nro\npo\nut\n,\nan\nd\nM\nor\nph\nol\nog\ny\nof\nth\ne\nM\nag\nne\ntic\nF\nie\nld\nat\nG\neo\nsy\nnc\nhr\non\nou\ns\nO\nrb\nit\nS\nol\nar\nW\nin\nd\nat\nE\nar\nth\nS\nta\nge\nof\nG\neo\nm\nag\nne\ntic\nA\nct\niv\nity\nS\nol\nar\nW\nin\nd\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nP\nla\nsm\na\nS\nhe\net\nP\nla\nsm\nas\nph\ner\ne\nE\nle\nct\nro\nn\nR\nad\nia\ntio\nn\nB\nel\nt\nM\nag\nne\ntic\nF\nie\nld\nS\nlo\nw\nw\nin\nd\nC\nal\nm\noc\ncu\nrs\n\u223c7\n0%\nof\ntim\ne\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nm\nod\nes\nt\nO\nrd\nin\nar\ny\nde\nns\nity\n;\nor\ndi\nna\nry\nte\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\nP\nla\nsm\nas\nph\ner\ne\ngr\now\nin\ng\nR\nel\nat\niv\nis\ntic\nel\nec\ntr\non\nfl\nux\nsl\now\nde\nca\ny\nC\nom\npr\nes\nsi\non\nst\nar\nts\n;\nw\nea\nk\nst\nre\ntc\nhi\nng\nC\nIR\nst\nar\nts\nC\nal\nm\nen\nds\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nlu\nm\npy\nO\nrd\nin\nar\ny\nde\nns\nity\n;\nor\ndi\nna\nry\nte\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\nP\nla\nsm\nas\nph\ner\ne\nR\nel\nat\niv\nis\ntic\nel\nec\ntr\non\nfl\nux\nsl\now\nde\nca\ny\nIn\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nco\nm\npr\nes\nsi\non\n;\nw\nea\nk\nst\nre\ntc\nhi\nng\nC\nom\npr\nes\nse\nd\nsl\now\nw\nin\nd\n(w\nes\ntw\nar\nd\nfl\now\n)\nM\nild\nge\nom\nag\nne\ntic\nac\ntiv\nity\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nri\nsi\nng\nO\nrd\nin\nar\ny\nde\nns\nity\n;\nor\ndi\nna\nry\nte\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\nP\nla\nsm\nas\nph\ner\ne\nR\nel\nat\niv\nis\ntic\nel\nec\ntr\non\nfl\nux\nsl\now\nde\nca\ny\nIn\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nco\nm\npr\nes\nsi\non\n;\nw\nea\nk\nst\nre\ntc\nhi\nng\nS\nec\nto\nr\nre\nve\nrs\nal\nin\nco\nm\npr\nes\nse\nd\nsl\now\nw\nin\nd\nG\neo\nm\nag\nne\ntic\nac\ntiv\nity\nri\nse\ns\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nhi\ngh\nS\nup\ner\nde\nns\ne\nst\nar\nts\n;\nex\ntr\na\nho\nt\nst\nar\nts\nP\nla\nsm\nas\nph\ner\ne\nR\nel\nat\niv\nis\ntic\nel\nec\ntr\non\nfl\nux\nsl\now\nde\nca\ny\nIn\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nco\nm\npr\nes\nsi\non\n;\nin\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nst\nre\ntc\nhi\nng\nC\nom\npr\nes\nse\nd\nsl\now\nw\nin\nd\nw\nith\nso\nut\nhw\nar\nd\nIM\nF\nS\nto\nrm\non\nse\nt\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nhi\ngh\nS\nup\ner\nde\nns\ne;\nex\ntr\na\nho\nt\nP\nlu\nm\ne\nst\nar\nts\n;\npl\nas\nm\na\nbe\nco\nm\nes\nlu\nm\npy\nO\nns\net\nof\nfl\nux\ndr\nop\nou\nt\nIn\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nco\nm\npr\nes\nsi\non\n;\nst\nro\nng\nst\nre\ntc\nhi\nng\nS\ntr\nea\nm\nin\nte\nrf\nac\ne\n(f\nlo\nw\nre\nve\nrs\nal\n)\nS\nto\nrm\nle\nve\nls\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nde\ncl\nin\nin\ng\nS\nup\ner\nde\nns\ne\nre\nac\nhe\ns\nda\nys\nid\ne\nP\nlu\nm\ne\nst\nro\nng\n,\nlu\nm\npy\nD\nro\npo\nut\non\ngo\nin\ng\nC\nom\npr\nes\nsi\non\npe\nak\ns;\nin\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nst\nre\ntc\nhi\nng\nC\nom\npr\nes\nse\nd\nfa\nst\nw\nin\nd\n(e\nas\ntw\nar\nd\nfl\now\n)\nS\nto\nrm\nle\nve\nls\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nm\nod\nes\nt\nS\nup\ner\nde\nns\ne;\nex\ntr\na\nho\nt\nP\nlu\nm\ne\nw\nea\nke\nni\nng\n,\nlu\nm\npy\nR\nec\nov\ner\ny\nof\nfl\nux\ndr\nop\nou\nt\nco\nm\nm\nen\nce\ns\nD\nec\nre\nas\nin\ng\nco\nm\npr\nes\nsi\non\n;\nst\nre\ntc\nhi\nng\npe\nak\ns\nan\nd\nde\ncl\nin\nes\nC\nIR\nen\nds\nS\nto\nrm\nle\nve\nls\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nlo\nw\nS\nup\ner\nde\nns\ne\nce\nas\nes\n;\nex\ntr\na\nho\nt\nco\nnt\nin\nue\ns\nP\nlu\nm\ne\nw\nea\nk\nan\nd\nlu\nm\npy\nR\nec\nov\ner\ny\npr\nog\nre\nss\nin\ng\nN\no\nco\nm\npr\nes\nsi\non\n;\nm\nod\nes\nt\nst\nre\ntc\nhi\nng\nF\nas\nt\nw\nin\nd\nA\nct\niv\nity\nsl\now\nly\nde\ncl\nin\nes\nD\nen\nsi\nty\nlo\nw\nO\nrd\nin\nar\ny\nde\nns\nity\n;\nex\ntr\na\nho\nt\nP\nlu\nm\ne\nw\nea\nk\nan\nd\nlu\nm\npy\nR\nec\nov\ner\ny\nco\nm\npl\net\ne\nN\no\nco\nm\npr\nes\nsi\non\n;\nm\nod\nes\nt\nst\nre\ntc\nhi\nng\nsl\now\nly\nde\ncl\nin\nes\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n29 of 35\n9.2. Parameterizing the Magnetospheric Magnetic\nField in Terms of Solar Wind Parameters\n[85] In Figures 8 and 9, it was seen that the dayside com-\npression perturbation \u2223B\u2223 at geosynchronous orbit seemed to\nbe closely related to the ram pressure of the solar wind at\nEarth. Modeling the dayside compression in terms of\nupstream solar wind parameters is entirely plausible. In fact,\nthe empirical relation between the dayside geosynchronous\norbit magnetic field strength \u2223B\u2223 (in nT) and the solar wind\nramp pressure Pram (in nPa) obtained here was \u2223B\u2223 =B = 106 +\n6.3 Pram (expression (2)).\n[86] Parameterizing the nightside stretching of the mag-\nnetic field in terms of upstream solar wind parameters will\nnot be so straightforward. In Figure 28 (bottom), the\nsuperposed average of the stretching angle \u0002 in the midnight\nsector of geosynchronous orbit is plotted as a function of\ntime, with the zero epoch (black dashed vertical line) taken\nto be storm onset. The peak of the stretching is marked with\na red vertical dashed line and the approximate onset and\ntermination of the strong\u2010stretching phase are marked with\ntwo green vertical dashed lines. In Figure 28 (top), the\nsuperposed averages of two geomagnetic indices (Kp and\nDst) are plotted and in the third through fifth panels of\nFigure 28 the superposed averages of three upstream\u2010solar\nwind parameters are plotted (Bz, vBz, and n). With the green\nand red vertical lines to guide the eye, it is clearly seen (1) that\nthe timing of the strong\u2010stretching phase of the geosynchro-\nnous magnetic field differs from the timing of the plotted\ngeomagnetic indices and solar wind parameters and (2) that\nwithout a time lag the temporal profile of the stretching angle\n\u0002 does not match the temporal profiles of the geomagnetic\nindices or the solar wind parameters. With a time lag the\nprofile of \u0002 may be matched up with the profile of the solar\nwind number density n.\n[87] The strong nightside\u2010stretching perturbation of the\nmagnetosphere at geosynchronous orbit was found to be\ncoincident with the temporal increase of the particle pressure\nof the ion plasma sheet on the nightside at geosynchronous\norbit (cf. Figures 18 and 19). That particle pressure is owed\nto elevated plasma sheet number densities (the superdense\nplasma sheet) and to elevated plasma sheet temperatures (the\nextra hot plasma sheet). The elevated plasma sheet number\ndensity is owed to the increased solar wind density of the\ncompressed slow wind of the CIR, with a time lag of a few\nhours for the dense solar wind plasma to enter into the mag-\nnetosphere and to reach geosynchronous orbit [Borovsky\net al., 1998b; Denton and Borovsky, 2009]. The elevated\nplasma sheet temperature is owed to the increased velocity of\nthe solar wind as the CIR passes the Earth; the onset of the\nextra hot phase of the plasma sheet lags the onset of the\nsuperdense phase by a few hours [cf. Denton and Borovsky,\n2009, Figure 8]. The enhanced plasma sheet pressure being a\nFigure 28. For the 63 high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms,\nthe superposed average of the magnetic field stretching\nangle \u0002 in the midnight sector of geosynchronous orbit as\nmeasured by five GOES satellites is plotted as a function\nof time from storm onset in the bottom. (The thin curve is\na 6 h running average and the thick curve is a 24 h running\naverage.) Also plotted are the superposed averages of (top)\nthe Kp index, (second panel) the Dst index, (third panel) Bz\n(GSM) of the solar wind, (fourth panel) vBz of the solar\nwind, and (fifth panel) the number density of the solar wind.\nThe black vertical dashed line is storm onset, the red vertical\ndashed line is the time at which the magnetic field stretching\nis maximum, and the two green vertical dashed lines denote\nthe beginning and end of the strong\u2010stretching phase.\nBOROVSKY AND DENTON: MAGNETIC FIELD AT GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT A08217A08217\n30 of 35\ncombination of the enhanced density and the enhanced tem-\nperature, the time lags add to produce an enhanced pressure\nperturbation that lags the solar wind density perturbation by\nseveral hours (cf. Figure 18).\n[88] With careful work, a parameterization of the mag-\nnetic field stretching at various locations in the magneto-\nsphere in terms of the solar wind number density and\nvelocity with appropriate (location\u2010dependent) time lags\ncould be developed.\n10. Summary of Findings\n[89] In this report superposed\u2010epoch analysis was used to\nstudy changes in the magnetospheric magnetic field at\ngeosynchronous orbit and the relation of those changes to\nthe solar wind, to the plasma sheet, and to the outer electron\nradiation belt. Sixty\u2010three high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms\nfrom 1995\u20132005 were utilized in the analysis of geosyn-\nchronous orbit measurements from GOES, MPA, and SOPA,\nsolar wind measurements from OMNI2, and the geomagnetic\nindices Kp,MBI, and PCI. The findings of the study are listed\nas follows.\n[90] 1. Compression of the magnetic field strength at\ngeosynchronous orbit is mainly on the dayside during high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms.\n[91] 2. The compression of the dayside magnetic field is\nsimultaneous with an increase in solar wind ram pressure\nassociated with enhanced solar wind density before and\nwithin the CIR.\n[92] 3. For high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms, the com-\npression of the dayside magnetosphere commences before\nstorm onset.\n[93] 4. Depending on how the data from the 63 high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms is analyzed to remove the effect\nof solar wind ram pressure on the Dst index, four different\nexpressions for Dst* are obtained and a wide range in Dst*\ntime profiles result. The recommended formula for high\u2010\nspeed stream\u2010driven storms is Dst* = Dst \u2212 20.7Pram1\/2 + 27.7.\n[94] 5. The stretching of the magnetic field at geosyn-\nchronous orbit during high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms in\nconcentrated on the nightside.\n[95] 6. The stretching of the magnetic field on the night-\nside during high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms has two phases:\na strong\u2010stretching phase during the first day of the storm and\na modest\u2010stretching phase that lasts for several days. The\ndawn and dusk sectors only exhibit the long\u2010lived modest\u2010\nstretching phase.\n[96] 7. The strong\u2010stretching phase is associated with a\nperturbation in the Dst* index that contributes to 15%\u201337%\nof the total value of Dst* during the high\u2010speed stream\u2010\ndriven storms, depending on the coefficients used for Dst*.\nThe favored value is 20%\u201325%. This is interpreted as the\ntail current fractional contribution to Dst*.\n[97] 8. The strong stretching phase is temporally associ-\nated with the occurrence of the superdense plasma sheet on\nthe nightside during high\u2010speed stream\u2010driven storms.\n[98] 9. The strong stretching appears to be caused by\nanomalously high ion pressure in the magnetosphere.\n[99] 10. The temporal profile of global relativistic electron\nflux dropout and recovery at geosynchronous orbit matches\nthe temporal profile of the nightside strong stretching and\nrelaxation at geosynchronous orbit.\n[100] 11. The number density dropout of the outer elec-\ntron radiation belt occurs early in the strong\u2010stretching\nphase and the number density recovery of the outer electron\nradiation belt commences before the stretching has reached its\nmaximum.\n[101] 12. Comparison between geosynchronous magnetic\nfield strengths and estimated magnetopause field strengths\nduring the dayside compression phase indicates that mag-\nnetopause shadowing should be important for dropping out\nthe nightside outer electron radiation belt during high\u2010speed\nstream\u2010driven storms.\n[102] 13. The amplitude dB of temporal (1 min) changes in\nthe magnetic field vector at geosynchronous orbit increases\nsubstantially at storm onset and then decays slowly in the\ndays of the storm.\n[103] 14. The normalized amplitude dB\/B of temporal\nchanges in the magnetic field vector at geosynchronous orbit\nis linearly proportional to several geomagnetic indices\n(Kp, PCI, and MBI).\n[104] 15. Whereas parameterization of the dayside com-\npression of the geosynchronous magnetic field is simple in\nterms of upstream solar wind parameters (i.e., ram pressure),\nparameterization of the nightside magnetic field stretching\nin terms of the upstream solar wind (i.e., number density and\nspeed) will require time lags to be implemented.\n[105] Acknowledgments.
