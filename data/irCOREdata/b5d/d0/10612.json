It has two interlinked aims: to highlight the \npotential that mobile interviews can offer in research with young people, especially in \nresearch contexts where the main focus is on mobility and its impacts, and to \ncontribute empirical evidence regarding the significance of everyday mobility to \nyoung people\u201fs lives and future life chances in sub-Saharan Africa. During the pilot \nphase of our research project on children, transport and mobility, the authors \nundertook walks home from school with teenage children\n1\n in four different research \nsites: three remote rural, one peri-urban.   As the children walked (usually over a \ndistance of around five kilometres) their stories of home, of school and of the \nenvironment in-between, gradually unfolded.  The lived experiences narrated during \nthese journeys offer considerable insights into the daily lives, fears and hopes of the \nyoung people concerned, and present a range of issues for further research as our \nstudy extends into its main phase.   \n \nIntroduction \nThis paper utilises mobile narratives as a route to understanding young people\u201fs \nexperiences of place and environment and the way these impact on their daily life\n2\n.  \nOur focus is on and around a narrow corridor extending between school and home, \ndrawing on studies we conducted in Malawi, Ghana and South Africa. We use these \nstudies to show how walking with young people can bring significant insights into \ntheir daily lives, fears and hopes and how the narratives which unfold are intimately \nbound up with and shaped by their daily lived experience of the environments around \nand along their travel routes.  Our aim is to show how mobile interviews can enhance \nresearch with young people, and the particular advantages a mobile interview confers \nwhere the study focus is on mobility and its role in shaping young people\u201fs lives in \nthe everyday i.e. where mobility is central to the unfolding narrative.  In the context of \ngrowing interest in mobilities across the social sciences (Sheller and Urry 2006, \nCresswell 2006), including specific consideration of walking practices (Lee and \n                                                 \n1\n We use the terms children and \u201eyoung people\u201f interchangeably in this paper.  When we asked young \npeople aged c. 12-18 years from the three countries at our Malawi inception workshop about \nterminology, they expressed no concern about the use of the term \u201echild\u201f for people in their teens. \n2\n A first draft of this paper was presented at a workshop at the Centre of West African Studies, \nUniversity of Birmingham, May 2007. \n \nIngold 2006, Ingold and Vergunst 2008), such mobile methods have considerable \npotential. The mobile interview contributes to the compendium of mobile methods \nsuch as participant observation, transect walks, neighbourhood walks, videod journeys \nand journeys using mobile phones linked to GPS receivers, which are being employed \nby researchers, including with children, albeit principally in Western contexts (e.g. \nMorrow 2001, Walker et al. 2009; but see Langevang 2007 for use of participant \nobservation with young people in a Ghanaian city).  \n \nThe empirical material produced in the course of our mobile interviews is described in \nsome detail, to illustrate the way the method illuminates our understanding of \nchildren\u201fs experiences on the everyday school journey.  The material presented also \ncontributes to the small but expanding literature charting the diversity of children and \nyoung people\u201fs everyday physical mobility and immobility in the continent, which \nincludes early work by Katz (1986, 1993), in rural Sudan, but is now often focused on \nurban or suburban environments (e.g. Langevang 2007, Gough 2008, Benwell 2009, \nLangevang and Gough 2009). Additionally, it extends debates about factors affecting \neducational access in sub-Saharan Africa (Ersado 2005, Lewin and Sayed 2005, \nHuisman and Smits 2009).   \n \nThe material we utilise in the paper is drawn from the pilot phase of an ongoing \nresearch project on children, transport and mobility\n3\n. This larger study (in three \ncountries, two agro-ecological zones per country, four sites \u2013 urban, peri-urban, rural \nand remote rural \u2013 per zone) has a focus not only on access to education, but also on \naccess to health care and to other services that are important to children\u201fs lives.  It \naims to build a strong evidence base which will substantially improve policy makers\u201f \nawareness of the crucial significance of mobility for young people across Africa: there \nis remarkably little knowledge of their current mobility patterns and even less about \ntheir transport and mobility needs (Porter and Abane 2008).  Mobile ethnographies\n4\n \nform a significant component in the larger study, which incorporates both adult and \nchild researcher strands. Here we report only on our first experimental walks \nconducted during the pilot phase of the adult research strand. While our focus within \nthe research project as a whole is not on children\u201fs environmental knowledge per se, \nwe would argue that children\u201fs interactions with their local environment, which we \nexamine in the course of this paper, are crucial to their lived experiences at home, at \nschool, on their journeys between the two, and in the shaping of their life chances and \naspirations for the future.   \n \nImprovement in children\u201fs (and especially girls\u201f) access to education in sub-Saharan \nAfrica is a key Millennium Development Goal and has prompted substantial research \nover the last decade. Issues such as fees and other payments to schools, the \nopportunity costs of time spent at school and educational quality are often raised, but \nrelatively little attention has been paid to the time, effort and\/or costs of transport \nincurred in getting to school.  However, significant points have been made by Avotri \net al. (1999) who observed how long walks to school due to lack of or high cost of \ntransport and attendant problems of lateness encouraged late \u201eover-age\u201f enrolment \n                                                 \n3\n  Details of this ESRC\/DFID-funded project are available at www.dur.ac.uk\/child.mobility\/   \n4\n  We use the term \u201emobile ethnography\u201f in this paper as specific acknowledgment of  the physical \nmobility of the subjects involved in making and recording the narrative, and the centrality of mobility \nto that narrative, as opposed to the type of multi-site ethnography which is more extensive across \ngeographical space and specifically embodied in the world system (Marcus 1995).  \n(especially of girls), truancy and early drop out in Ghana, and by the 2003 National \nHousehold Travel Survey in South Africa which found 76% of \u201elearners\u201f walking to \ntheir educational destination and almost 3 million out of the 16 million total \n(especially those located in more rural provinces) spending more than an hour a day \nwalking to and from educational institutions (RSA Department of Transport 2003).  In \nAfrica\u201fs rural areas, schools cannot be provided in every settlement and secondary \nschools, in particular, are likely to be located at a distance: long walks to and from \nschool are inevitable, even in locations where regular transport is available, given the \nwidespread lack of funds to pay children\u201fs fares.   \n \nAccompanying children on long walks from school in Ghana, Malawi and South \nAfrica, allowed us to share their mobility experiences, if only for an afternoon.  It \nopened a window for us into their  everyday lives and daily routines (Holloway and \nValentine 2000:11-15 , Katz 2004, Horton and Kraftl 2006).  The mundane mobilities \nof the everyday, reflected in the individual narratives we report below, incorporate \nsubstantial dynamic and embodied encounters with place. These include occasional \ndislocating rhythms and disruptions which can be frightening, even life-threatening, \nbut must be addressed and woven back into the mundane (Binnie et al. 2007).  They \nalso indicate the extent to which subjective, gendered experiences of the everyday \njourney to and from school in Africa not only have significance in themselves, but can \naffect ability and willingness to learn, act as impediments to regular educational \naccess and ultimately shape future lives.  There are fascinating comparisons to be \nmade with children\u201fs experiences of school and other journeys in Western \nenvironments, where parental and other protections have been established to guard \nchildren from the threat of disorder (Katz 2004, Hillman 2006), but there is \ninsufficient space  to consider them in this paper.  \n \nFollowing a review of methodology we describe each of the four walks we undertook \nin the pilot and then explore the children\u201fs narratives which unfolded as they walked. \nThis allows us to reflect on how the lived experience of the journey on foot between \nschool and home, and the subjective experience of the environment this entails, \nimpacts on young people\u201fs lives and life chances.  \n \nMethodology \nOur discussion is based on studies conducted with teenagers in four different \nlocations: one each in Ghana and Malawi, two in South Africa.  Three of the sites in \nwhich the accompanied walks took place could be classified as relatively remote \nrural, one (in South Africa) as transitional between peri-urban and rural.  In the study \nlocations we generally walked with three or four young people for the accompanied \nwalks, usually both girls and boys: in all except the peri-urban location they were at \nthe upper end of primary\/Junior Secondary School.  In each country the authors were \nworking with a team of local researchers, and it was in most cases one or more of the \nauthors\n5\n plus three or four adult research assistants (RAs) (seven in Ghana, where the \nresearch team was larger) who participated in the school to home walks. These walks \nformed only one component of the pilot research programme with adult researchers \nsince we were experimenting with a number of different methods, including life \n                                                 \n5\n The project lead researcher, Gina Porter, participated in all the walks discussed in the paper.  Some of \nthe in-country collaborators were unable to participate in their country pilot walk but are included as \nauthors because they helped to organise the walk concerned. \nhistories with people in their mid-20s, and individual stationary and group interviews \nwith children of various ages in mixed and single-gender groups.  \n \nThe common format in the mobile interview was for each RA to walk with one child \n(preferably of the same gender): normally the pairs walked at a similar pace, and kept \nother pairs in sight.  The authors walked with different pairs at various times and held \nbrief review discussions along the route at a few key points.  Conversations were \nconducted in the child\u201fs own first language but RAs made rough (verbatim) notes, as \nthey walked, or at each of a number of short stops, then wrote up their notes and \nimpressions in English shortly afterwards. RAs were asked to discard the checklists \nthey had been using in stationary interviews and instead to encourage the child with \nwhom they were walking into a more spontaneous conversation about the walk, using \nprompts such as any change in the child\u201fs pace, an obstacle or any notable features,  \nto encourage the child to comment where necessary.  If conversation tailed off we \nsuggested they could raise such topics as their destination (the child\u201fs home and home \nlife), experience at the point from which they had travelled (the school in this case), \nother times the child had travelled this route, any notable things which had happened \non this journey at other times, and their own compared to other children\u201fs experiences \nalong the route. Four accompanied walks made with a total of 18 children are reported \nin this paper.  The names of all the children involved have been changed to preserve \nanonymity.  \n \nThe young people in each case were recruited from pupils at a school in a settlement \nwhere we had already started a pilot programme of research with children, their \nparents, teachers and community leaders.  We decided to explore the potential of this \nmode of working partially because initial research with children in these study \nlocations in which our (university based) RAs attempted to conduct stationery \ninterviews with young people raised common problems: the children often were shy \nand intimidated by the inequalities of the perceived power relationship, resulting in \nawkward silences (Hill 2006).  In some cases parents (from whom permission to \ninterview children had been requested) hovered, usually adding to the interview \ntension, or answered on behalf of the child.  We introduced the school-to-home walks \npartly as a way of circumventing these problems, partly as a way of ourselves \nexperiencing and understanding some of the difficulties faced by children who live at \na distance from school.   \n \nWe found this approach highly effective, both in terms of eliciting information and in \nterms of improved understanding. Even very shy young girls were able to open up \nafter some minutes.  They no longer needed to make (or avoid) eye contact with the \ninterviewer because they were walking side-by-side, and neither they nor the \naccompanying RA had to worry about uncomfortable silences because the nature of \nthe terrain and\/or the exertion of walking made silence a natural component of the \ninterchange.  We observed that a formal question and answer format was usually \neasily abandoned by both interviewer and by interviewee in favour of informal \nconversation and unsolicited observation from the interviewee.   Such interchange not \nonly enabled the RAs to contextualise the teenagers\u201f lives beyond the walk itself, but \nalso enabled the teenagers to ask questions about the lives of their urban visitors.  \nParents (although still approached in advance to give permission) were at home or at \nwork at the time of day when the walk home from school took place and none \nobjected, perhaps because of the group nature of the exercise, the fact that school \nhead-teachers had also approved the exercise, and because walking to and from \nschool is perceived as a normal everyday activity, whereas being interviewed is not.   \n \nThe selection of children for this component of the pilot was made according to their \nplace of residence.  We asked staff at the schools which were participating in our \nresearch about the more distant settlements they served and then asked the head-\nteacher to identify a small set of pupils, all from the same distant settlement or \nneighbouring settlements. We then agreed a day on which pupils could be \naccompanied home after school finished.  Parental permissions were obtained through \nthe school.  The walks generally commenced about 2 p.m., covered a distance of \naround five kilometres and took between about 100 and 120 minutes (i.e. with stops: \nprobably 60 minutes without stops, though children usually estimated they normally \ntook about 120 minutes or more to complete their journeys).   \n \nThe piloting of the accompanied walks has provided valuable lessons regarding their \nuse in the main phase of the project.   RAs found it difficult to write detailed notes \nduring the walks, and consequently we have emphasised the importance of making \nquick jottings en route but then writing up full notes of conversation and observation \nimmediately after the walk.  Arguably, tape recording of the walk could provide a \nmore complete record, but transcription time would be substantial and there could be \na temptation for the RA to record his\/her own observations as the walk progressed, \nrather than simply noting down such observations, thus subtly changing the nature of \nthe interchange with their young respondent.  We have encouraged the RAs to \ncontinue with the pattern of the pilot walks in the main phase of work, i.e. avoiding a \nsemi-structured interview format but rather using experiences on each individual walk \nto direct the conversation where necessary, while ensuring that key facts such as age, \nfamily\/household background and relevant experiences regarding the facility to which \nthey are walking, are obtained before the end of the walk, if they have not arisen \nnaturally within the conversational exchange. \n \nLogistical and ethical issues which have arisen in the wider project are discussed \nelsewhere (Porter et al. in press; Robson et al. in press).  One of the main difficulties \nwe have found in organising walks is the gender composition of research teams.  In all \ncountries it has been hard to recruit women RAs (in part because of the requirement to \nwork in remote areas) and young men in their 20s and 30s comprise the majority in \nevery adult research team, yet convention deems it unsuitable for girls to walk alone \nwith young men, especially beyond the confines of the village.  Consequently RAs try \nto ensure the accompanied walks they undertake with girls, where possible, include a \nnumber of walking pairs and that one female RA is present among the group. Such \nwalks inevitably tend to take time to organise given the importance of obtaining \nnecessary permissions from both the young people themselves and their parents or \ncarers. \n \n \nThe walks from school \n \n1. Malawi \nIn Malawi our accompanied walk took place at the start of the rainy season in Zomba \ndistrict in the Shire Highlands region, along a narrow but direct footpath linking the \nprimary school at Busi\n6\n c. 12 kms from the paved road) to the remoter village of  \nSolero.  This settlement is located approximately four kilometres away across five \nstreams (and c. six kilometres by a more circuitous rough but motorable road).  Three \nschoolgirls from the village, all in the upper level of primary school and in their early \nto mid-teens (the eldest 16 years) were accompanied by three RAs (two young men, \none young woman) during the walk.  The pupils normally walk together to and from \nschool: there are no other children from their village who attend school on a daily \nbasis from home, because of the distance.   \n \nThe route passes through cultivated land (mainly growing maize), isolated \nhomesteads, and areas of bush in which two graveyards are located. There are three \nlocally constructed wooden bridges to cross in this dissected landscape: one was only \nconstructed in the past year; before that a number of deaths from drowning had \noccurred. Two other streams are unbridged.  In the wet season the route is potentially \nquite dangerous: a slippery path, gullies, steep slopes and streams in full spate.  If the \nrains are very heavy the girls sometimes wait to see if the water in the streams will \nsubside.  If not, they may then have to take a more circuitous route.  When the fields \nare being cultivated they must walk in the gullies between the crops rather than on the \nridges or they will be chased by farmers.  \n \n2. Ghana \nBy comparison with the Malawi accompanied walk, the five kilometre walk which we \nundertook with children in the Ghana pilot was relatively easy: there were no streams \nto cross and the route mostly follows a narrow unpaved road, in parts surrounded by \ntall grasses.  This walk took place in Central Region, in an off-road area of undulating \nland west of Nyankumasi, in the transition zone between coastal savanna and rain \nforest where cocoa farming is an important economic activity.  The walk was made in \nthe dry season from the primary school at Fosu to two cocoa producing hamlets which \nhave no services.  In this case seven adult researchers were involved in the walk, \naccompanying seven children who live in neighbouring hamlets: three girls aged \nbetween 11 and 14, four boys aged between 14 and 18 years.    \n \nThe route is hilly but easily traversed because an unpaved road is available for much \nof the journey. Approximately four kilometres of the road is easily motorable; the last \nkilometre to the further hamlet is usually motorable, albeit with difficulty.  However, \nfew vehicles use the route, except on two local weekly market days, when minibuses \nbased in nearby towns drive in to take local farmers and traders to market.  The road \npasses through bush areas, including one in which a graveyard is located.  There are \noccasional patches of cultivated field and considerable areas planted with cocoa: \nsettlement is sparse with only a few scattered homesteads. \n \n3. South Africa \nIn South Africa we undertook two separate pilot studies, one in each of our selected \nagro-ecological zones, because of the need to train separate research teams in each \narea (for logistical and linguistic reasons).  The first pilot took place in Eastern Cape, \nwith a Xhosa-speaking team, the second in North West region, with a Tswana- and \n                                                 \n6\n Names of smaller rural settlements and all children\u201fs names have been changed in order to give \nanonymity to the schools and children concerned.   \nSotho-speaking team.  Both took place towards the end of the rainy season, i.e. at the \nend of the summer. \n \nThe accompanied walk in Eastern Cape was conducted in the upland Pondoland \nregion of Port St Johns Local Municipality (Ward 10), from the Junior Secondary  \nSchool (JSS) in the off-road village of Sapiwe (about 5km to the nearest paved road) \nto Lomati, a remote upland village with no road access, approximately four kilometres \ndistant and located at the other side of a substantial hill, standing approximately 120 \nmetres above the surrounding land.  The journey was made along a narrow path, \nmostly through grass and scrubland, occasionally crossing steep scree slopes and \nsmall streams.   The research team of four researchers (two young men, two young \nwomen) accompanied three girls aged 15, 17 and 19 years and a young man of 22 \nyears (who is still attending JSS). \n \nThe accompanied walk with school children in North West region was conducted \nfrom a secondary school in Winterveld, a large, dispersed settlement, about 50 kms \nnorth-west of Pretoria in the Tshwane metropolitan area.  By contrast with the other \nsettlements in our pilot, Winterveld is best described as mixed peri-urban. It is located \nwithin the area occupied before 1994 by the homeland of Bophuthatswana.  The \nmajority of inhabitants are either unemployed and living on social grants or work in \nthe distant industrial centre at Rosslyn, near Pretoria.  Routes were followed to \nstudents\u201f homes in another dispersed more rural settlement, Kromkuil, about 4-5  kms \ndistant across the plain: the route starts in an area of dispersed buildings and small \ngarden plots, but then  a series of narrow paths cross about 3 kms of  largely \nuncultivated scrubland with trees, including some relatively deep (approximately 8-10 \nfeet) depressions, before passing over a paved road to reach more dispersed settlement \nat Kromkuil.   In this case our team of four researchers (three young men, one young \nwoman) walked with two girls of 17 and 20 and two boys of 17 years.  \n \nEnvironment and lived experience on the walk from school: children\u2019s \nnarratives \nObservation during the walks from school and the children\u201fs narratives which \nunfolded as we walked indicate the range of activities which commonly take place in \nall three countries:  \n-     The physical act of walking  \n- Dealing with physical hazards along the walk associated with the environment \ntraversed  (crossing streams, climbing slopes, sliding down banks, negotiating \ngullies and steep, slippery footpaths) \n- Dealing with other hazards \u2013material and otherwise- encountered along the \nway (threatening dogs, abusive calls, threatening farmers, potential rapists, \nwitches, bandits, ghosts, snakes, wild animals \u2013 real or imagined- such as \nfoxes, hyenas, leopards, lions) \n- Play (fights, football etc.) and courtship \n- Carrying loads (school books, farm produce, sand, groceries, other items) \n- Collection of wild fruits\/ plants in season for refreshment on the journey or for \nconsumption at another time (e.g. mangoes and other wild fruits in Malawi, \nguavas in Eastern Cape) \n- Drinking water from the streams because of thirst during the journey.  \n- Brushing down clothes and cleaning up shoes (if worn on the journey) before \nfinal entry into the school grounds.  \n The precise nature of these activities is shaped by the environmental context, by the \ncultural and socio-economic context, by gender and, to some extent, by age.  Such \nactivities may, in turn, help shape the lives and life chances of the children concerned, \nan issue we discuss in greater depth in the following section. \n \nBasic physical ability to walk a long distance to school helps shape school enrolment \npatterns in all the remote villages where our child research participants are resident.  \nChildren are not enrolled at school until they are physically able to make the journey \nto and from school each day: this delays the age at which children start school, \nespecially when the child has no older siblings or children resident nearby with whom \nthey can travel.  In the case of the Eastern Cape village (where our JSS respondents \nwere already in their late teens and early twenties), most children do not start school \nuntil they are about eight years old, or even later, because of the distance and the \nchallenging nature of the route along which their journey takes place.  Stephen, the \n22-year old boy we accompanied told us he did not start school until he was 12 \nbecause of the distance and he still finds the daily journey daunting:   \u201cwhen I think \nabout school my heart becomes bitter for the distance I travel to school is very long \nfor me. At times I think about dropping out of school like other children in my \nlocation who have stopped going to school because of the long distance\u201d.  A girl from \nthe same village reported that only two people in the community had passed standard \n10.  She observed, \u201cI like school but my journey discourages me\u201d.  Similarly, one of \nour Malawian respondents talked of her boy cousin who stopped school at 14 years, in \nstandard 5, because he felt the distance to primary school was simply too far to travel \ndaily.  Even along the relatively easy route to school in our Ghana example, a group \nof male parents in the remote village concerned emphasised how strongly ability to \nwalk the distance affects school enrolment. However, Effie, the youngest of the \nchildren we interviewed from this village, didn\u201ft see distance as an issue: \u201cI do not \nhave a problem with walking since it has become part of me\u201d.  She is learning to ride \na bicycle (using part of her breakfast money occasionally to hire a cycle to practice) \nbut will soon leave the school to attend another in a nearby town, where she will live \nwith relatives.   \n \nSchool attendance of children living in remoter locations is often affected by \nenvironmental conditions along the route. Crossing rapidly rising rivers in the rainy \nseason can be particularly dangerous, as our Malawian, Eastern Cape and North West \n(Kromkuil) respondents all observed, often pointing to particularly difficult areas and \nobstacles as we walked. In such cases it is necessary at times to take a circuitous route \nwhich adds not only additional distance but also additional time to the journey.  In \nboth Malawi and Eastern Cape the girls recounted days when they had to simply turn \nback because the rivers were so high.  Such problems did not arise in the Ghanaian \npilot area but are a significant issue in other parts of that country (Avotri et al. 1999).  \nLearning how to respond to disruptions of this and other kinds (Binnie et al 2009) is a \ncompetency which children gradually build up over time, but the presence of such \nintermittent and sometimes unpredictable hazards also helps to explain why parents in \nremote areas are often reluctant to send younger children to school. \n \nIn every region where we walked there were pupils who complained about problems \nof getting their shoes and uniform dirty, especially in the rains when it is easy to slip \nand fall, but also in the dry season when there may be clouds of dust from unpaved \npaths.  In many cases the school children carry their shoes in order not to get them \ndirty before they reach school.  A dirty uniform or shoes can result in punishment at \nschool or being barred from school for \u201enot being neat\u201f.  Children may have to sit all \nday in wet clothes, having finally arrived at school. \u201cThe mud on the way makes us \ndirty and we wash our feet at the last river before we reach the school: we have to put \noff our shoes if it is raining.  Our teachers understand our route, they do not punish \nus much - they give us two lashes, but we sometimes miss morning classes\u201d. (19 year \nold girl, grade 9, Eastern Cape).  Such corporal punishment is widespread in schools \nacross all our study countries, whether officially banned or not, and is a very common \nconsequence of late arrival in class (even if lateness is due to good reasons such as a \ndifficult journey or heavy home duties).  In Ghana the children had been made to \ncarry sand to school (for constructing a school building), as a punishment for \nunpunctuality.  \n \nPhysical hazards along the route are only one component of the school access story, \nhowever, especially so far as girls and younger children are concerned.  When the \ncrops and grass are well grown, fear of encounters with dangerous bandits and other \nmaterial or spirit beings which may be hidden by the vegetation is often particularly \nstrong. The areas around graveyards present a particular hazard, not only for the \nspirits which children fear they may encounter there, but also because the land around \nis often untended and covered by dense vegetation, and because of their location away \nfrom habitation.  In a stationary interview it is possible that this issue would have \nbeen forgotten, but as we passed graveyards in both our Malawi and Ghana walks, the \nchildren\u201fs pace increased and prompted comment.  In Malawi, Melina observed with \na shudder, \u201cThere are many rumours of visitations: I have heard people hide in the \ngraveyard and try to get children\u201fs bags, notebooks and suchlike\u201d  \nThis observation was supported by Elly, the youngest of the Malawian girls on this \njourney:  \n\u201cthere are so many problems [here]. You meet a very long person and I suspect it\u201fs a \nwitch, and there are dogs that chase us and fierce animals \u2013 lions and hyenas- and \nthey bit us. Three children were once bitten \u2013 one by a lion and she died, and two \nboys were bitten by hyenas, but they are still alive\u201d7.  \n The third Malawian girl in our walking party confirmed the problem of dogs\n8\n around \nthe graveyard and talked about a \u201cmadman\u201d who once chased her.  Later, beyond the \ngraveyard, when we stopped for a brief chat and for the RAs to make some notes, all \nthe children reported having seen a mysterious fire at the graveyard, and ascribed this \nto witchcraft.  \n   \nIn Ghana 11\u2013year old Effie also worried about the cemetery she passes along her \nroute to and from school.  Again it was the actual process of walking past the \ngraveyard that prompted her to comment.   Ghosts live here, she observed, so she is \nkeen to ensure she walks with her elder brother, especially in the morning. \nUnfortunately, he is usually ready to leave home before her (because he has fewer \nhousehold tasks to perform): if he does not wait for her she runs along this section.  \nThe other girls on this route were particularly concerned about an area of long grass \nwhere the road is very narrow since they have heard stories of people being beheaded \n                                                 \n7\n In Malawi, as in much of sub-Saharan Africa, fear of spirits and belief in witches is widespread \namong children and adults.  Hyenas are associated with witchcraft.  \n8\n Regarding dogs as a source of fear among mobile children see also Benwell (2009) on suburban Cape \nTown.  \nthere.  They were more sanguine about other potential dangers \u2013 snakes are seen \nsometimes, for instance, but they are said to be mostly harmless. \n \nIn our Ghana pilot walk rape per se was not raised as a specific danger, in contrast to \nthe pilots in both Malawi and South Africa where fear of rape was strongly expressed \nby the girls we interviewed.  In Malawi, Eva, aged 16 reported that she had only \nrecently been chased by five older boys (apparently intent on rape): again this \nobservation was prompted by our walking past the specific point at which this \nexperience had occurred.  When we interviewed parents and teachers in surrounding \nvillages, they very frequently raised the issue of rape and teenage pregnancy: we were \ntold that most girls in this Shire Highlands area do not finish school because they get \npregnant.  Susan, a 17 year old secondary school pupil, in South Africa\u201fs North West \nProvince, had heard of many cases of rape along the route she travels to and from \nschool and, as we walked, pointed out the depressions and wooded areas where men \n(including groups who meet there to smoke dagga) may wait to attack passers by,: \n\u201cI fear people who hide in the bush [waiting] for us. They wait for us in the bush and \nas we walk, especially when you are alone, they grab your school bag with all the \nbelongings that you have with you\u2026. The bush is bad, you cannot see people hiding \nor seeking you.  \u2026 I love sports but I cannot be left behind [at school] because I will \narrive very late at home.  It is even worse to cross the  bush at night. There are so \nmany rapists there at night and a lot of drunk people\u201d.   \nSusan\u201fs fears are by no means unrealistic: the day after our walk we learned that a girl \nfrom the same school had been raped on the way to school. Young boys have also \nbeen raped. In the case of our Eastern Cape route, actual rape cases are rarer, though \nstories still abound and were recalled by a number of children independently to \nindividual RAs as they walked, generally as they were passing through the most \nheavily wooded area. \n \nThe stresses of the basic daily walk are compounded by work demands in rural \nenvironments, in particular (i.e. all the case study areas except Winterveld\/Kromkuil).  \nIn all the rural areas where we walked children must collect water (often multiple \ntrips) and undertake a range of other domestic chores prior to the journey to school. \nThey also have to work in the fields.  In the Ghanaian study area, children play a key \nrole in cocoa head porterage, especially in the rainy season when the local road access \nis poor.  In all three remote rural sites girl children, in particular, told us how they \nmust rise at dawn or earlier to undertake their chores before setting out for school. In \nMalawi, Melina, who is fostered by her aunt, was particularly concerned about being \nlate for school as a result of the quantity of household chores she has to complete \nbefore leaving home each morning.  (Such chores commonly seem to be heaviest \namong fostered girls in all three countries, an issue we will explore in the main phase \nof our study.)   If she is late, Melina told us, she is sometimes forgiven and allowed to \njoin the lesson in progress but at other times she is simply sent directly home as \npunishment, despite the fact that, in her case, this entails a long, lonely and potentially \nhazardous walk.  If she is very late, she sometimes feels it is preferable to play truant \nthat day.   \n \nBy contrast with the girls, most boys reported a less onerous set of tasks that had to be  \ncompleted on weekdays before school (though they are often occupied with tasks such \nas farming, herding, collecting groceries or other work at the weekend).  This accords \nwith literature on child work in African contexts which suggests that once boys reach \ntheir mid teens their contribution to domestic work, particularly carrying water and \nfirewood, is much reduced (Andvig 2001): consequently they are likely to start their \njourneys to school in time and less exhausted. The boys we accompanied tended to \ncomplain more about the distance than girls traversing the same routes but still found \ntime to play with friends (football and fights) along the way. Like the girls, they are \nkeen to avoid being late because of the fear of being lashed or other punishments \n(such as sweeping or cutting grass around the school compound), but they more \ncommonly report being delayed by games than by household tasks which must be \naccomplished before they leave home.   \n \nMany of the children with whom we walked \u2013 girls and boys \u2013 express and display \ngreat determination: some have ambitions far beyond what they can hope to achieve \nin the context of the limited schooling available to them, and yet undertaking the \njourney itself seems to be a daily affirmation of their will to succeed.  Succeeding, \nunsurprisingly, is conventionally expressed in terms of being elsewhere, in a more \naccessible (urban) world, with the resources to travel at will: being a doctor, a nurse \nor a lawyer.  Nonetheless, it is remarkable that so many children are prepared to make \nlong and tiring journeys of the type we describe, in sometimes hazardous conditions, \noften after arduous work at home and possibly on an empty stomach, to reach a \nfacility which, especially in the case of primary schools, is usually inadequate in so \nmany respects: poor infrastructure (overcrowded classrooms, few lavatories, leaking \nroofs, no windows), little equipment, and under-staffed in some cases by inadequately \ntrained teachers who are often absent and regularly inflict corporal or other \npunishments with impunity.   \n \nEnvironment and lived experience on the school journey: reflecting on \nimplications for future livelihood and life chances \nBy contrast with school children\u201fs very limited independent mobility in Western \ncontexts today, the mobility of the children we accompanied on their journeys from \nschool in sub-Saharan Africa may seem remarkable\n9\n.  All the children with whom we \nmade the accompanied walks travel daily, year in and year out, to and from school \nover a distance of about five kilometres.  They walk on their own or in small groups; \nvery rarely with adults, a fact which they find unsurprising: parents and carers are \nreportedly too busy to accompany them.   \n \nIn some respects their travel history might, superficially, appear remarkably positive.  \nTheir level of physical activity is substantially higher than that of Western children, \namong whom risk of obesity is a growing concern. There are also seeming advantages \nin terms of their interaction with the physical environment and the potential this offers \nfor children\u201fs cognitive development (Bjorklid 2004, Wells 2000). Other arguments \nmight be made around contact with nature and the potential this gives for \ndevelopment of environmental awareness and knowledge (Katz 1986, Hart 1997) and \n(perhaps especially in the case of trees or running water) for mental well-being (e.g. \nKorpela et al 2002, Milligan and Bingley 2007).  \n \nHowever, as the Western literature emphasises, children\u201fs environmental experiences \nare also complicated by societal and individual factors (e.g. Gesler 1992, 1993).  \n                                                 \n9\n In other parts of Europe, notably Scandinavia , children are more independently mobile than in UK, \nbut even here there has been some decline (Bjorklid 2004). \nThere is little literature available on this theme in rural African contexts\n10\n, but from \nour own observations in this and earlier research, the benefits of regular daily travel \non foot are usually little appreciated by those who must undertake such journeys, \ndespite the natural beauty of many of the landscapes traversed.  The woodlands and \ntree-studded lush grasslands through which we passed on our accompanied walks, for \ninstance, might be viewed as highly beneficial to mental well-being in some Western \ncontexts (Bell 1999), but are often a source of children\u201fs (and parents\u201f) fear.  \nWoodlands are places where potentially malevolent spirits dwell and wild animals \nand bandits roam, areas which must be passed through at speed (as is also sometimes \nthe case in Western perceptions too, see Milligan and Bingley 2007).   Streams and \nrivers were perceived by our respondents as offering an opportunity for refreshment \nduring a long walk, but after heavy rains are a potential death trap in regions with few \ngood bridges (especially since few rural children away from major water sources learn \nhow to swim: there are usually no swimming lessons and no safe swimming pools \nwithin which to learn).   \n \nMoreover, these long journeys through potentially hazardous environments add to the \nother factors which may constrain and curtail a child\u201fs educational opportunities, \nultimately tipping the balance between the decision to attend or to abandon school, \nand thereby affect their future livelihood opportunities and life chances.  As we saw in \nthe case of Stephen in Malawi, some parents living in areas remote from school  \nsimply do not enrol their children in school at all, or do not enrol them until they are \nrelatively old, because of the distance and potential dangers along the route they must \ntraverse.  Disabled children are unlikely to attend school at all, in such conditions.  \nIf\/when children are finally enrolled, as our narratives above amply illustrate, they \ncommonly face a wide range of daily hazards. Although children also occasionally \nreported pleasures along the journey to school \u2013 picking fruits, running down hills, \neven courtship and sexual adventures in the case of a few boys (especially during the \ndry season) \u2013 all the narratives put greater emphasis on the more negative aspects of \nthe journeys.    \n \nWe have mostly described children\u201fs journeys to first stage schools: primary\/JSS \n(only the Winterveld\/Kromkuil study was with secondary school pupils).  Once \nchildren graduate to secondary school travel difficulties are usually compounded for \nchildren in rural areas, since schools are fewer in number and more commonly located \nin major service centres.  In some cases the children will board at school, or move to \nlive with relatives in town (as in the Ghanaian case mentioned above): they may even \nmove into rented accommodation close to the school.  However, the barriers to \nsecondary education are often unsurmountable, especially for girls: the distances to be \ncovered daily are too great, the costs of relocation (including loss of domestic labour \nat home) unaffordable.   \n \n                                                 \n10\n Though see Katz\u201fs work in a rural village in Sudan (1986, 1991, 1993, 2004) which emphasises \nyoung boys\u201f and pre-pubescent girls\u201f substantial spatial range and Matthews\u201f 1995 study within a \nKenyan roadside village. Matthews\u201f case study emphasises parental control on children\u201fs movements, \nand finds \u201ethe environmental range of Kanyakine children was much more strictly sanctioned than for \ncomparable age groups in Britain\u201f (p. 288): this was possible because of  the specific context, in that a \nschool and other facilities were available within the village.  We will examine variations in children\u201fs \nenvironmental experiences and impact of parental sanctions on movement in a wide range of different \ncontexts in our larger study.   \nNot surprisingly, many girls in particular find even regular primary school attendance \ndifficult and thus withdraw from school at a very early stage in their school career.  \nThe decision will be made in the context of a complex of factors such as (parental \nand\/or child) fear of rape, the long journey, exhaustion (and associated lack of \nconcentration and poor results at school) after a long walk following domestic chores, \npunishments at school following late arrival, the family\u201fs need of help at home, costs \nof uniform, books and other school-related charges (even where there are no formal \nfees) etc.  In some cases pregnancy and\/or early marriage speeds the decision (though \nwe were told girls occasionally return to school after the baby is born). However (as \nour mobile narratives suggest), the access factor is likely to form a significant \ncomponent of the decision to withdraw, a hypothesis we are exploring through both \nqualitative and survey research across 24 research sites in the main phase of our \nstudy.    \n \nThe impact of limited education must not be underestimated. In the case of girls it is \nlikely to shape not only the current generation\u201fs access to work opportunities, but also \nthe life chances of the next generation through influence on fertility rates, child-\nrearing practices and related factors.  The relationship between female education and \nreduced fertility is now well established (e.g. Ainsworth et al 1995; Martin and Juarez \n1995, Scribner1995, Dreze and Murthi 2001).  Recent work suggests a threshold \neffect, such that the effect of the first few years of schooling on fertility is less \npredictable, but thereafter the relationship is virtually universal and is one of the \nclearest determinants of fertility decline (Diamond, Newby and Varle 1999).  Thus, \ngirls who have to curtail their education at an early stage because of access difficulties \nare more likely to go on to have large families.  The relationship between maternal \neducation and childcare practices, child health and mortality is even better established \n(Levine et al. 1991, Hobcraft 1993, Joshi 1994, Kabeer 2005, Boyle et al. 2006\n11\n).  \nBetter educated mothers tend to respond better to public health messages (e.g. about \nnutrition and hygiene) and they are more likely to seek and receive appropriate \nhealthcare for their children than their less educated counterparts, resulting in \nimproved child survival.  There is also a clear inter-generational effect in terms of \nschooling: better educated mothers are more likely to send their own children (and \ngirls in particular) to school, thus perpetuating child health and survival benefits into \nfuture generations. \n \nConclusion \nWalking produces a shared rhythm of movement (Lee and Ingold 2006) which \nencourages conversation, companionability and the sharing of understandings.  \nThrough our mobile interviews we learned a great deal about the everyday lives of the \nchildren whom we accompanied \u2013 and they in turn felt sufficiently at ease to ask \nquestions of us.  The school-to-home journeys we accompanied and that are reported \nin this study are among the lengthier ones experienced in each school from which our \ninterviewees were recruited: we specifically selected pupils with a relatively long \njourney home for the pilot, in order to give the RAs time to practice the skills they \nwould need in working with this method,  but the stories the young people relate have \nwide-scale resonance across sub-Saharan Africa  (Avotri et al 1999, Porter 2002, RSA \n                                                 \n11\n Boyle et al., using DHS surveys across 42 developing countries, note a particularly strong \nassociation between child health and maternal education (though particularly at upper levels of \neducation) in Ghana.   \nDepartment of Transport 2003).  These are tales of the everyday, not the exceptional \n(Benwell 2009).   \n \nNonetheless, the accompanied walks we made in our pilot studies are clearly not \ngeneralisable: the narratives which unfolded are about particular young people in \nparticular places.  Indeed, it was the interaction between person and place that proved \nto be critical in our analysis.  As Dixon and Durrheim (2000:27) point out, places are \nnot \u201cfixed, empty and undialectical backgrounds to [\u2026] social action.  [Instead]  \nPlaces are dynamic arenas that are both socially constituted and constitutive of the \nsocial.\u201d  Mobility represents a key element in this interaction between people and \nplace: \u201csocial relations \u2026.. are not enacted in situ but are paced out along the ground\u201d \n(Ingold and Vergunst 2008:1).  The dynamic and dialectical nature of space and travel \nare strongly evident in the children\u201fs mobile narratives presented and analysed here.   \n \nFirstly, as we saw, different children passing through the same spaces interpret and \nreact to those spaces differently.  In particular, gender and, to a lesser extent, age \ninfluence the ways in which the young people experience and respond to their \njourneys to school.  Girls are more likely than boys to be afraid of unpleasant and \npotentially dangerous encounters with other people along the way, from possible \nrapists to people shouting abuse and telling them they should be at home helping their \nmothers.  Girls also experience more problems of having to hurry and missing \nopportunities to walk with others (thus losing potential social and safety benefits), \nowing to their greater involvement with domestic tasks before school.  Younger \nchildren typically find the journey more physically difficult and, in many cases, more \ndangerous, than older ones, who can more easily climb over tree roots and ford \nstreams.  Moreover, younger children are most likely to be afraid of \u201cimagined\u201d \ndangers, such as lions, witches and ghosts. \n \nSecondly, it is the subjective experience of environment that shape children\u201fs access \nto schools and life chances.  Some of the hazards discussed by children are clearly \nvery real, such as the danger of rape in Winterveld\/Kromkuil and the risks of injury \nand tiredness because of the difficult terrain traversed.  Other dangers exist more in \nthe minds of the children than in reality.  Examples include fears of drowning or rape \nin areas where no such instances had actually every occurred, or fears of supernatural \nhazards.  However, such imagined dangers are just as real for the children as the more \n\u201cobjective\u201d dangers, and can have just as strong an effect on their behaviour.  Thus, \none young boy, with the agreement of his parents, had changed school because of \nfears that many children at his former school were being bewitched.  His new school \nwas much further away and entailed a difficult journey over very rough terrain.  The \nphysical difficulties of the journey, combined with his age, meant that he often found \nit too difficult to get to school and his attendance had become more sporadic. \n \nOur experience with mobile interviews in the pilots suggests the method has \nconsiderable advantages in research with young people and is certainly worthy of \nconsideration for inclusion among a compendium of methods. The young interviewee \ncan avoid unwelcome eye contact with a relative stranger, yet the shared rhythm of \nwalking encourages companionability and the development of rapport. The \nembarrassment of uncomfortable silences is avoided: spaces in conversation are \nnatural, shaped perhaps by a change in speed, or the necessity of exertion.  The walk \nalso avoids unwanted interventions from parents and others adults who may not only \nlisten in during stationary interviews but sometimes try to answer for the child (a \nproblem we have encountered in stationary interviews with young people at home).  \nMoreover, the walk has particular value where research is focused on mobilities:  the \nshared experience of the journeys helps us to penetrate and explore the realities of \nchildren\u201fs mobile worlds where stationary description is difficult.  In the pilots they \nhave allowed us to traverse environments rarely encountered by adult researchers in \ntheir urban-based lives and to physically appreciate the lived experience of a daily \nfive kilometre walk to and from school.  They have given children the space to offer \ntheir own interpretations of their journeys, expressing feelings and fears on their own \nterms, since some of the difficult power relations often inherent in adult-to-child \nresearch are eased by the process of walking together.   \n \nWe would suggest that the walking conversation, whether as part of a purposive \njourney along a defined route, or even merely a perambulation, has much to offer in \nmany research contexts, but perhaps especially where establishing rapport with \ninterviewees is complicated by strongly skewed power relations.    Our RAs, who are \nmostly urban-based university postgraduates from relatively privileged backgrounds, \nreported that, for them, the walks were a revelation: they now appreciated the \nimplications when a child reported walking five or more kilometres to school and \nanother five kilometres home every day, especially when the majority of these \nchildren were also substantially involved in water collection, other domestic duties \nand sometimes agricultural labour before and after school and in some cases left home \neach morning without having eaten.  Sensitive issues such as fear, risk, hunger, work \nloads and ill-treatment which emerged in walking conversations away from the home \nenvironment, within the context of a companionable exchange, might well not have \nbeen adequately addressed in the conventional stationary interview.  Additionally, the \nwalk has proved to be a useful mnemonic device in conversations around mobility, \noffering reminders of significant obstacles, fears, pleasures and other elements \naffecting the experience of travel.  In an African context the walking interview has the \nspecific advantage of enabling lengthy, in-depth conversations with children and \nyoung people who are often time poor and whose labour contributions may be vital to \nhousehold sustenance: the interview can be conducted even as they go about their \nwork, without holding up tasks which the child is required to accomplish (such as \ntravelling to the grinding mill, collecting water etc.). As we moved into our main \nphase of research the walking method and the insights we have gained from it have \nthus helped us to build a more robust and realistic framework of understanding.    \n \nAcknowledgments \nThis study was made possible  by the following people: the children who agreed to \nparticipate in this study, the schools which helped with arrangements (including \ngaining parental consents) and the following RAs and researchers who walked with \nindividual children:  Ghana: Samuel Agblorti, Esia Donko, Regina Obli-Odei, Mercy \nOtsin, Samuel Owusu, Augustine Tanle, Ekaw Afful Wellington; Malawi: Linny  \nKachama,  Matthews  Nkosi,  Bernie  Zakeyo; South Africa, Eastern Cape:  Andisiwe \nBango, Sipho Dube, Nokholo Hlezupondo, Busi  Luwaca, Noma Mlomo; South \nAfrica, Gauteng\/North West region: Dumisane  Buthelezi, Lucas Marole, Marinkie \nMolwelang, Goodhope Mponya.
