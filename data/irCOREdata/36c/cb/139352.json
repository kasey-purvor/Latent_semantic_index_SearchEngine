SRB are important members of the 4 \nmicroflora of a typical anaerobic digester [8]. The electron donors for sulfate-reducing 5 \nmicroorganisms in anaerobic reactors include a variety of low-molecular mass organic compounds, 6 \nsuch as mono- and dicarboxylic aliphatic acids, alcohols, polar aromatic compounds and even 7 \nhydrocarbons. Oxidation of organic compounds may be incomplete, with acetate (often 8 \nsimultaneously with CO2) as a potential by-product; or it is a complete oxidation, leading to the 9 \nfinal production of CO2. Dissimilatory biological sulfate reduction is a process carried out by many 10 \nbacteria and some archaea [9]. In such environment, simple compounds (ethanol, methanol, acetate 11 \nand H2\/CO2) seem to be preferred over complex substances [10]. Ethanol was found to be a suitable 12 \ncarbon and energy source for sustaining sulfate reduction in such anaerobic reactors.  The use of 13 \nethanol in sulfate\u2013reducing systems has already been applied in full-scale plants [11, 4] in lab-scale 14 \nUASB [12] and in a fluidized bed reactor [13].  15 \nThe aim of this study was to characterize the microbial biofilm community colonizing a mineral 16 \ncoal substrate inside an ASBBR pilot-plant treating a sulfate-rich wastewater from an industrial 17 \nsulfonation process. In addition, the microbial characterization was further associated to a 18 \nsimplified mathematical model analysis contextualizing the experimental data in order to suggest 19 \npotential metabolic pathways under different conditions of COD\/Sulfate ratios. 20 \n  21 \n2. Materials and Methods 22 \nInfluent Wastewater 23 \n Sulfonated oils are produced from the reaction of vegetal oils with sulphuric acid and liquid 24 \nammonia in a batch reactor operated under controlled temperature. The industrial wastewater (Table 25 \nPage 4 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 3 \n1) containing high sulphate concentration, which originated from washing the products of this 1 \nprocess, was collected in plastic vessels and transported to the laboratory for feeding the rector. 2 \n 3 \nASBBR reactor  4 \n 5 \nThe 1.2 m\n3\n ASBBR reactor was constructed in \u201cFiberglass\u201d and it was filled with 500 kg of 6 \nirregular pieces of mineral coal (40 to 80 mm of diameter) occupying a volume of 1.0 m\n3\n (porosity  7 \n= 0.5). The treatment volume available by cycle or batch mode was 0.6 m\n3 \n.The outlet biogas tube 8 \nfrom head-space (0.2 m\n3\n) was immersed in a hydraulic seal (100 l) containing an alkaline solution 9 \n(NaOH) for H2S removal.  10 \nThe influent wastewater was pumped from a storage tank (0.6 m\n3\n) to a circular perforated tube 11 \nlocated at the reactor\u201fs bottom for achieving a better liquid distribution. Mixing was provided by 12 \nliquid recirculation (up-flow) by means of a centrifuged pump (Jacuzzi-model 5JL15) connected to 13 \nthe inflow distribution system. The cycle time was of 48 h, including the steps of feeding (1 h), 14 \nreaction with liquid recirculation (46 h) and discharge (1 h). The reactor was operated at ambient 15 \ntemperature (31\u00b12\n0\nC) in the Laboratory of Biological Processes (Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o 16 \nCarlos-Brasil). A scheme of the experimental set-up is presented in Figure 1. 17 \n 18 \nOperational conditions (ASBBR) 19 \nInitially, the ASBBR was inoculated with 0.2 m\n3\n of anaerobic sludge taken from a full-scale 20 \nUASB treating domestic sewage. The reactor was operated during 30 batch cycles under increasing 21 \ninfluent sulfate concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n for inoculum acclimatization. Domestic 22 \nsewage (Table 2) at different volumes depending on the desired influent sulfate concentration was 23 \nused to dilute the sulfate-rich industrial wastewater. In this phase, domestic sewage was the only 24 \nelectron donor used for sulfate reduction and the COD\/sulfate ratio were 2.13\u00b10.35 and 1.89\u00b10.65, 25 \nrespectively. 26 \nAfterwards the reactor was fed with 1.0 (20 cycles), 2.0 (8 cycles) and 3.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n (12 cycles) 27 \ncorresponding to sulfate loading rates of 0.65 to 1.90 kgSO4\n-2\n\/cycle during 40 cycles. Recirculation 28 \nwas provided by a centrifugal pump with capacity for 3.5 m\n3\n h\n-1\n.Ethanol was used as the main 29 \nPage 5 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 4 \nelectron donor for sulfate reduction. The added volume varied according to the sulfate removal 1 \nefficiencies obtained for the different COD\/sulfate ratios applied aiming at maximizing the sulfate 2 \nreduction efficiency. The COD\/sulfate ratios applied in the ASBBR reactor were 1.77\u00b10.26 (1 3 \ngSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n), 1.64\u00b10.40 (2gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n) and 1.50\u00b10.25 (3gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n).  4 \n 5 \nReactor monitoring 6 \n Sulfate and COD removal efficiency were monitored during 40 cycles. Temporal profiles for 7 \nthe three different operational conditions (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n) were carried out after the 8 \nASBBR reactor had achieved stability, keeping the high sulfate reduction efficiency of 9 \napproximately 99%. Samples for analyses were taken from the suction pipe of the recirculation 10 \npump during 48 h (cycle time).  11 \nAnalysis of sulfate, COD (total), pH, total dissolved sulfide (TDS) were performed according to 12 \nthe Standard Methods [14] during temporal profiles. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) as acetic acid and 13 \nethanol concentrations were determined by gas chromatography in equipment HP 6890, with a HP-14 \nINNOVAX (30m x 0.25mm x 0.25\u00b5m) column and H2 as the carrier gas [15] to get the temporal 15 \nprofile data.  16 \n 17 \nMathematical model  18 \nThe generation of simplified mathematical model (Figure 2) involved five reactions (1, 2, 3, 4 19 \nand 5) representing the main metabolic pathways for acidogenesis, methanogenesis and 20 \nsulphidogenesis in presence of ethanol as organic source.  21 \n )(2\n1 isacidogenesHAcetatekEthanol A        (1) 22 \n)(24\n1 esismethanogenCOCHkAcetate M       (2) 23 \n)(2\n1 nesissulphidogeSHAcetatekEthanolSulfate S      (3) 24 \n)(22\n2 nesissulphidogeCOSHkEthanolSulfate S      (4) 25 \n)(22\n3 nesissulphidogeCOSHkAcetateSulfate S      (5)26 \n  27 \n 28 \nDifferential equations (6, 7 and 8) were proposed to represent first order kinetic model of these 29 \nmetabolic pathways based in the simplified mathematical model. The differential equations were 30 \nPage 6 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 5 \nsolved by applying the Method of Runge-Kutta (4\nth \norder) using the program developed in 1 \nMicrosoft Excel  [16]. The first order kinetic parameters were obtained by minimizing the 2 \ndifferences between the theoretical and experimental data (sulfate, ethanol and acetic acid).  3 \nSulfatekSulfatekSulfatek\ndt\nSulfated\nSSS ... 321                              (6) 4 \nSulfatekSulfatekEthanolk\ndt\nEthanold\nSSA ... 211         (7) 5 \nSulfatekSulfatekAcetickEthanolk\ndt\nAceticd\nSSMA .... 1311             (8)  6 \nThe theoretical data were used to adjust in experimental profiles of sulfate, ethanol and acetic 7 \nacid obtained from the operational conditions in the ASBBR (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 gSO4\n2- \nl\n-1\n). The 8 \nkinetic parameter obtained from the mathematical model can predict the metabolic routes developed 9 \nby sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), acidogenic bacteria (AB) and methanogenic archaea (MA) in 10 \nthe several sulfate concentration applied. If any kinetic parameter value was equal to zero, the 11 \ncorresponded metabolic route was disconsidered. 12 \n 13 \nMolecular analysis 14 \nMicrobial diversity was assessed using 16S rRNA clone library obtained from biofilm samples 15 \ncollected inside the reactor subjected to influent sulfate concentrations of 1.0, 2.0 e 3.0 gSO4\n2-\n l\n-1\n at 16 \nthe end of the respective trial. Microbial biomass was obtained by washing the mineral coal 17 \nmatrices with PBS-buffer and total bacterial DNA was then extracted as described elsewhere [17]. 18 \nPCR amplification were carried out using the universal bacterial primes 27 f ( 5`AGA GTT TGA 19 \nTCC TGG CTC AG 3`) and 907r (5`CCG TCA ATT CCT TTG AGT TT 3`) [18] and archaeal 20 \nprimers 1100f  (5\u00b4 AAC CGT CGA CAG TCA GGY AAC GAG CGAG 3`) and 1400R (5`CGG 21 \nCGA ATT CGT GCA AGG AGC AGG GAC 3`) [19]. The 16S rRNA fragments were cloned into 22 \nthe plasmid pCR 2.1 TOPO-TA easy vector system, and transformed into E. coli DH\u03b15 as 23 \nsuggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen\u00ae). Clones were randomly selected from original 300 24 \ncolonies for bacteria and archaea and they were screened for positive inserts with M13 primers 25 \nPage 7 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 6 \naccording to the manufacturer instructions. A total of 100 randomly chosen positive clones, for each 1 \noperational condition, were sequenced in ABI 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) using M13 2 \nprimers (forward and reverse, separately). The resultant nucleotide sequences were assembled, 3 \nchecked for potential chimerical sequences and compared with the electronic database in order to 4 \nidentify the closest matches (Ribosomal Database Project) [20]. The ribossomal 16S DNA 5 \nfragments were grouped to produce a phylogenetic tree for the domain bacteria showing the 6 \nevolutionary distance between the cloned sequences and sequences of type category downloaded 7 \nfrom the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP). The tree was constructed using PAUP and Kimura 2- 8 \nparameter algorithm. Bootstraps values higher than 90 were not displayed in the tree. Shannon and 9 \nevenness indexes were calculated using observed frequencies within the clone library [21].  10 \n 11 \n3. Results and discussion 12 \nDuring start-up, which consisted of an acclimation period of 30 cycles, ASBBR showed 13 \naverages of sulfate reduction efficiencies of 97 and 99% at the initial concentrations of 0.25 and 14 \n0.50 gSO4\n-2\n.l\n-1\n, respectively. After this period, the reactor was monitored during 40 cycles under 15 \ninfluent sulfate concentration of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n. The maximum sulfate removal rate 16 \n(SRR) was of 1.6 kgSO4\n2-\n\/cycle at the sulfate loading rate (SLR) of 1.9 kgSO4\n2-\n\/cycle (Figure 3). 17 \nSulfate reduction efficiencies were very high (about 99%) for the concentrations of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 18 \ngSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n, respectively. Effluent sulfate concentrations were never recorded exciding the value of 5 19 \nmgSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n. On the other hand, a gradual decrease of COD removal efficiencies was observed along 20 \nthe experiments. The mean of removal efficiencies decreased from 70% to 41% for organic loading 21 \nrates (OLR) ranging from 1.4 to 3.0 kgCOD\/cycle (Figure 3). The mean values of COD 22 \nconcentrations were 0.72 g l\n-1\n (1.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n), 1.45 g l\n-1\n (2.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n) and 3.01 g.l\n-1\n (3.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n) 23 \nfor sulfate concentration of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n, respectively. In average, and with a different 24 \ntendency than efficiency, organic removal rates (ORR) increased from 0.95 to 1.75 kgCOD\/cycle in 25 \nthe trial with 1.0 and 2.0 gSO4\n-2\n. However, ORR decreased to 1.20 kgCOD\/cycle in the trial with 26 \nPage 8 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 7 \n3.0 gSO4\n-2\n. The mean value of the effluent pH also decreased from the beginning (7.1) to the end 1 \n(6.7) of the period the reactor was subjected to 3.0 gSO4\n2-\n l\n-1\n.  2 \nA first order kinetic model was adjusted to the temporal profiles of sulfate, ethanol and acetic 3 \nacid at the operating conditions of 1.0; 2.0 and 3.0 gSO4\n2\n l\n-1\n, respectively (Figure 4). Figure 2 shows 4 \na schematic map of potential metabolic routes within the ASBBR and Table 3 summarizes the first-5 \norder kinetic parameters which were used as input data to describe such idealized model. A direct 6 \ncomparison of the schematic pathways shown in Figure 2 with the kinetic parameters of Table 3 7 \nformed the basic rationale used to predict the preferential pathways. For instance, at high sulfate 8 \nconcentration the mathematical model suggested that acidogenesis and methanogenesis (k1A and 9 \nk1M = zero, Table 2) were inhibited by sulfate concentrations and that sulfate reduction was mainly 10 \nperformed by incomplete sulfate-reducing activity (k1S = 0.0594 h\n-1\n). According to such rational, 11 \nthe results obtained with the kinetic model suggested that ASBBR operated exclusively under 12 \nsulphidogenic condition and, therefore, the effluent showed high concentrations of acetic acid 13 \n(equation 3). On the other hand, values of non ionized sulfide concentration were below the 14 \nreported inhibitory values of 50-250 mg\/L, for methanogens and 50-550 mg\/L for SRB [22]. 15 \nAdditionally, Celis-Garc\u00eda et al. [23] reported that a sulfidogenic biofilm could operate under total 16 \nsulfide concentrations as high as 1,200 mg\/L and any toxic effect due to sulfide concentrations at 17 \nthe prevailing pH values obtained seemed to be unlikely for SRB or methanogens. On the other 18 \nhand, the former authors report experiments carried out in continuous-flow reactors without coal as 19 \nsupport material. In this work, the operating system using batch reactor with recirculation may be 20 \nthe cause of inhibitory effect at lower sulfide concentration. Recirculation in batch systems 21 \nincreases the risk of sulfide toxicity, particularly at the adopted high up-flow velocity of 22 m h\n-1\n.       22 \nMicrobial analysis identified 32 distinct operating taxonomic units (OTUs) retrieved from a 23 \nclone library containing 100 entries for each operating condition of sulfate loading rates (1.0, 2.0 24 \nand 3.0 gSO4\n2\n l\n-1\n, respectively) and only one recurrent clone of a methanogenic archaea was 25 \nobserved in the treatments with initial concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 gSO4\n2\n l\n-1\n. Figure 5 shows OTUs 26 \nPage 9 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 8 \nphylogenetic associations and Figure 6 shows their frequencies in their respective clone libraries; 1 \nwhich were obtained from the reactor\u201fs biomass sampled at the end of each trial separately (1.0, 2.0 2 \nand 3.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n respectively). The majority of the OTUs were either associated to the group I 3 \n(non-acetate oxidizers) or group II (acetate oxidizers) of the sulfate-reducing bacteria.  4 \n The molecular inventory suggests a decrease of the microbial diversity with the increase of 5 \nsulfate concentration. The values of Shannon and Evenness indexes were of 1.09 and 0.39; 1.20 and 6 \n0.38, and 0.79 and 0.35 for the sulfate concentrations of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 gSO4\n2\n l\n-1\n, respectively. 7 \nAlthough sulfate removal efficiencies were high (about 99%) during the trials, variations in the 8 \nOTUs frequencies suggested a significant shift in bacterial species.  9 \nConsidering the operational condition of 1.0 and 2.0 gSO4\n2\n l\n-1\n, the predominant bacterial groups 10 \nwere affiliated with Beta-proteobacteria (Aminomonas spp. and Thermanaerovibrio spp.) and 11 \nDelta-proteobacterias (Desulfovibrio spp. and Desulfomicrobium spp.). In such operational 12 \nconditions, it was also observed the presence of methanogenic archaea (99% of similarity with 13 \nMethanosaeta sp. NCBI AY 454768). Possible combinations between physiologies of these groups 14 \nsuggest a potential syntrophic interaction between some species of sulfate-reducing bacteria and 15 \nmethanogenic archaea in the trials at initial concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 gSO4\n2\n l\n-1\n. Such organisms 16 \nare commonly associated to the group of \"Synergists\" [24]. The contribution of synergists in the 17 \nperformance of anaerobic reactors has not been fully explored [25]. Some species are capable of 18 \ngrowing on amino acids (Aminomonas paucivorans [26], Thermanaerovibrio acidovorans [27], 19 \nAminobacterium mobile [28] and Aminobacterium colombiense [29]); and others 20 \n(Thermanaerovibrio velox [30] and Anaerobaculum sp.) may show preferences for carbohydrates 21 \n[31]. Despite the fact that those distinct species show different metabolic preferences at certain 22 \nconditions, their presence and frequency in the sample (Figure 6) correlate with the degradation 23 \npathway suggested by coefficient k1a (0.206 h\n-1\n) which reflect the conversion of the ethanol to 24 \nacetic acid at high rates in Period I by such type of acidogenic organisms (Table 3).  25 \nPage 10 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 9 \n Temporal profiling of acids during each batch cycle suggested a higher rate of acetate 1 \naccumulation in the first hours of the cycle against their overall consumption rates (500 and 1200 2 \nmg l\n-1\n) for the initial concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 gSO4\n2\n l\n-1\n, respectively, (Figure 4a and 4b). The 3 \nkinetic coefficient k1M for the respective former initial sulfate concentrations (0.0637 and 0.0378 h\n-\n4 \n1\n, Table 3), may be associated to the activity of methanogenic species such as Methanosaeta spp.; 5 \nwhich were organisms identified in the respective samples.  6 \nIt is known that syntrophic acidogenic bacteria benefit from the activity of SRB that oxidize 7 \nhydrogen, once the former assist on the maintenance of low partial pressure of this gas within the 8 \nreactor. Several of the observed OTUs matched organisms that are capable of hydrogen oxidation 9 \n(Desulfovibrio spp. and Desulfomicrobium spp). Furthermore, syntrophic acidogenic bacteria may 10 \nuse ethanol as electron donors and such activity could result in the accumulation of acetate. The 11 \npotential existence of such metabolic pathway in the trials was explored by the results obtained with 12 \ncoefficient k1S (Table 3 and Figure 2). For instance, the coefficient k1a of 0.2064 h\n-1\n for 13 \nconcentration of 1.0 gSO4\n2-\n l\n-1 \nmay refer to H2 consumption by litotrophic bacteria [32]. 14 \nDesulfomonile spp. OTUs were observed at initial concentration of 2.0 gSO4\n2-\nl\n-1\n. These types of 15 \norganisms are acetate oxidizers and such metabolic pathway was described by coefficient k3S; 16 \nwhich was significantly higher in the phase 1 (Table 3). In the same way, higher frequency of 17 \nDesulforhabdus spp in clone library 2 may correlate to the complete oxidation of ethanol [9] which 18 \nwas at peak on Period II (coefficient k2S, Table 3).  19 \nAt initial concentrations of 3.0 gSO4\n2\n l\n-1\n the influent showed significant increase in TDS and in 20 \nthe concentration of volatile acids (as acetic acid) (Figure 4c) and as methanogenesis was inhibited 21 \nmethanogenic organisms were not detected in the clone library. The decrease in the organic matter 22 \nremoval rates were probably related to the accumulation of acetic acid in the reactor [33, 34] caused 23 \nprimarily by inhibition of methanogenesis. Inhibition was a result of the increase in the 24 \nconcentration of non-ionized sulfide (H2S) from 55 to 177 mg l\n-1\n (TDS: 132 to 287 mg l\n-1\n) during 25 \ntreatment of high sulfate concentrations. Furthermore, it has been reported that the outcome of 26 \nPage 11 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 10 \nsulfide inhibition depends not only on the pH, which is directly related to the H2S concentration, but 1 \nalso on the TDS concentration and the biomass characteristics [35]. This suggests that both TDS 2 \nand H2S may promote an inhibitory effect on the organisms (SRB and MA). The decrease of pH 3 \nvalues in the effluent at initial concentration of 3.0 gSO4\n2-\n l\n-1\n (from 6.7 to 5.6) suggests the presence 4 \nof non-dissociated H2S as the main form of sulfur. Figure 4d shows the variations in the H2S for the 5 \ntrial with initial concentrations of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n and maximum of H2S concentration 6 \nwere of 115 mg l\n-1\n (H2S\/TDS=0.51), 138 mg l\n-1 \n(H2S\/TDS=0.45) and 194 mg l\n-1\n (H2S\/TDS=0.88), 7 \nrespectively. Therefore, the inhibitory concentration of methanogenesis (3.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n), was 8 \ncoincidental with the predominance of non-dissociated H2S (profile-88%), but it did not correlate 9 \nwith the TDS concentration, as it was also observed elsewhere [36]. This suggests that H2S exerted 10 \nhigher inhibitory effect on the methanogenic organisms than on the sulfate-reducing bacteria and 11 \nthis result was observed at sulfate concentrations equal or higher than 2.0 gSO4\n-2\n l\n-1\n. 12 \nIt is known that the competition between SBR and MA is determined by the COD\/sulfate 13 \nratios. According to some authors, the boundary determining a truly sulfate-reducing environment 14 \noccurs on a COD\/sulfate ratio of 0.67 [37]. On the other hand, there is some controversy between 15 \nthe applications of such COD\/sulfate ratios when applied to biological treatment of complex 16 \nwastes. The combination of organic substrates and of microbial species may affect the final ratios 17 \nof COD to sulfate concentration. It was observed a significant shift in the microbial species in the 18 \ndifferent treatments (Figure 6). The frequency and diversity of moderate thermophilic fermentative 19 \nbacteria decreased with increasing sulfate concentrations. Although Dysgonomonas spp. and 20 \nCoprotermobacter spp. are associated to fermentative bacteria [38, 39], the mathematical model 21 \nshowed that their potential activity did not affected the main metabolic pathways described by 22 \ncoefficient k1S (0.0594 h\n-1\n) and k3S (0.01357 h\n-1\n), respectively (Table 3). The absence of 23 \nacetoclastic methanogenic organisms and the accumulation of acetate, highlighted by the 24 \ncoefficient k1S, can be associated to the appearance of Desulfovibrio spp., which are acetate 25 \nproducing bacteria. On the other hand, the appearance of Desulfurella can be also associated with 26 \nPage 12 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 11 \nthe complete oxidation of acetate as highlighted by the coefficient k3S. This genus include acetate 1 \nmoderate thermophilic oxidizer which are capable of completely mineralize ethanol, lactate [40] 2 \nand acetate as sole carbon.  3 \n 4 \n4. Conclusions 5 \n 6 \nThese experiments showed that full-scale ASBBR reactors filled with mineral coal is an effective 7 \nalternative for treating sulphate-rich wastewater. The reactor achieved significant sulfate reduction 8 \nefficiencies (99%) in a short period of operation at different sulphate initial concentrations (1.0 to 9 \n3.0 gSO4\n2-\n l\n-1\n). Mineral coal was an effective inert support for biomass attachment, In addition, it 10 \ncan be concluded that this reactor configuration and operating parameters favour removal of 11 \nsulphate at high rates. The kinetic parameters of the adopted model described the experimental data 12 \nand, in conjunction to the microbial characterization, they suggested that at initial concentrations of 13 \n1.0 and 2.0 gSO4\n2-\n l\n-1\n both sulphidogenesis and methanogenesis may have occurred simultaneously. 14 \nThe observed kinetic parameters used for considering metabolic relations among acidogenic 15 \nbacteria, acetoclastic methanogenic archaeas and sulfate-reducing bacteria of the group I (non 16 \nacetate oxidizers) and of the group II (acetate oxidizers) showed significant parallel and potential 17 \nfor physiological interaction which culminated with high rates of sulfate removal. However, high 18 \nconcentrations of reduced sulfur compounds (TDS) and high residual COD were observed at 19 \ninfluent sulfate concentrations higher than 2.0 gSO4\n2-\n l\n-1\n. Under such conditions, methanogenesis 20 \nwas inhibited by high concentrations of undissociated H2S formed during the sulfate reduction 21 \nprocess. At 3.0 gSO4\n2-\n l\n-1\n, the microbial diversity index was lower than in other tested 22 \nconcentrations indicating a significant shift in the community occurred as a result. On the other 23 \nhand, as no decrease of sulfate removal efficiencies was observed, it is possible that the selected 24 \norganisms were metabolically adapted which helped to sustain the functional stability of the 25 \nsystem. 26 \nThe bacterial populations and the patterns of the main metabolic pathways observed in this 27 \nwork shown that the functional stability in terms of sulfate reduction does not imply microbial 28 \nPage 13 of 29\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 12 \ncommunity stability. It was observed that a dynamic community was able to remove sulfate at high 1 \nrates and at high initial concentrations. 2 \n 3 \nAcknowledgments 4 \n 5 \n 6 \nAcknowledgments are because of Brazilian Research funding institutions Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo a 7 \nPesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo-FAPESP (research grants 03\/07799-2) and Conselho Nacional de 8 \nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico-CNPq (Edital Universal: number 019\/2004 and process 9 \nnumber: 478355\/2004-1). 10 \n 11 \n5.
