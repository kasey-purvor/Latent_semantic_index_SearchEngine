Furthermore, c-Si\nhas size restrictions imposed by wafer manufacturability and\nlarge area displays are not feasible with such a technology.\nSince then flat emitter materials such as diamond,2 amor-\nphous carbon3 (a-C), a-Si:H,4 polycrystalline silicon,5,7\n~poly-Si! and silicon nanowires6 have shown a wide range of\npossibilities for using thin film technology as cold cathodes.\nHowever, these flat films do not benefit from external geo-\nmetric enhancement as compared to those with tip structures.\nThe field emission from a-Si is not fully understood and\npoly-Si deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition\n~LPCVD! does not give uniform emission site densities.7 Al-\nthough poly-Si deposited by LPCVD could produce tip\nstructures through photolithographic processes, its large\ngrain boundaries prevent the forming of uniform sharp tip\nstructures.8 Silicon, especially the amorphous and polycrys-\ntalline forms are the preferred choice for the display indus-\ntries as it is well established and forms the basis of a proven\nlarge area technology. It could readily be integrated into the\npresent driver circuits and it is cheap to manufacture with\nexisting technologies with large area displays being feasible.\nIn this letter, we report on the electron field emission\nresults obtained from laser crystallized Si. A study of these\ncrystallized structures has led us to a possible explanation of\nthe emission process with an internal field being a major\ndriving force for emission of electrons under high fields.\nThe a-Si:H films were deposited at a thickness of 100\nnm using a standard plasma enhance chemical vapor deposi-\ntion ~PECVD! system with feed gases of silane (SiH4) and\nhydrogen (H2). The films were undoped, and deposited on\nglass substrates coated with a continuous molybdenum ~Mo!\nfilm of 100 nm thickness.

Redistribution subject to AIP lwavelength! was used to irradiate the a-Si:H samples with a\nscan rate of 2 mm\/s over the length of the sample to produce\na strip of width 4 mm. The process was carried out in air.\nStrips of crystallized silicon regions with energy densities of\n179, 204, 221, 235, 241, and 263 mJ\/cm2 were used in our\ninvestigation. The fabrication process is scalable to larger\nareas compatible with displays of dimensions 1 m31 m.\nFor field emission measurements a spherical stainless\nsteel anode, 5 mm in diameter, was placed above the cathode\nsurface, which was greater than 20 mm320 mm in area, by\nmeans of a micrometer controlled apparatus. The emission\ncurrent ~I in amps! versus macroscopic electric field ~E in\nV\/mm! characteristics was obtained at a vacuum better than\n531026 mbar. The macroscopic field used to plot the char-\nacteristics was simply the applied voltage ~V! divided by the\nvacuum gap ~mm!. Each current reading was recorded only\nwhen a stable applied voltage was detected. The recorded\nvalue is taken from an average of a hundred readings. The\napplied voltage was incremented in 15 V steps from 50 to\n2000 V, with a current limit set at 131025 A. The field\nemission threshold was defined when the emission current\nreached 131029 A at a particular electric field. The num-\nbers of field emission data points shown in the plots have\nbeen greatly reduced for clarity.\nThe excimer laser was used to irradiate a total substrate\narea which was 75 mm375 mm square in 4 mm370 mm\nstrips with different energy densities and each area tested for\nits field emission properties. The electron field emission ob-\ntained for the different energy density treated films is shown\nin Fig. 1~a!. The rate of change in the gradient of the slopes\nis different for each film. It shows the steepest slope and\nlowest emission threshold is from the film with an area irra-\ndiated by an energy density of 204 mJ\/cm2. When the emis-\nsion area from this film was imaged using a commercial\nphosphor screen at 30 V\/mm, the site density coverage was\nin excess of 80%. Individual emission sites could not be\nimaged, as the emission observed was uniformly bright\nthroughout except for 2 or 3 very high brightness regions.\nThese results point toward the film irradiated with 204\nmJ\/cm2 having the most uniform and best threshold field.

The dense and relatively sharp tips created using an\nenergy density of 204 mJ\/cm2 improves the geometrical b\nfactor for field emission from the crystallized a-Si:H film.\nHowever, the enhancement factor based on geometric con-\nsiderations is still only 3. The high density of emission sites\nis clearly visible when the phosphor screen is used to com-\npare images obtained from 204 mJ\/cm2 with other laser en-\nergies.\nThe field emission data shown in Fig. 3 is taken from the\nsample irradiated with an energy density of 204 mJ\/cm2, for\ndifferent vacuum gaps. It shows the emission process to be\nlargely independent of the anode to cathode distance, and to\nbe related only to the applied field. The independence of the\nfield emission threshold with vacuum gap may at first sight\nsuggest that bulk material properties and space charge does\nnot take part in the field emission process.\nFrom Table I it is clear that the geometric enhancement\nb factor does play a role in this field emission process. How-\never, it may not be the only or main factor that controls the\nlow threshold emission, as there are large discrepancies be-\ntween the b factor calculated from the F\u2013N plot and the b\nfactor calculated from the estimated height ~h! and radius ~r!\nof the tips from the SEM micrographs using the formula,15\nb5h\/r . The ratio is based on the tallest average tips ~ignor-\ning the short tips!, as the emission will be dominated by\nthese features, and the height is obtained from the SEM im-\nage with the sample with the highest b factor tilted at 45\u00b0.\nThe width is taken directly from the plane view SEM. Oval\nfeatures are ignored in the calculation as these tips will be\nslanted and thereby have lower b factors. The b factor that is\ncalculated from the electrically controlled F\u2013N plot has a\nmuch higher value, as shown in Table I. The ratio difference\nbetween the two b values shows a large step for the sample\nirradiated with 204 mJ\/cm2. This result suggests an internal\nfield enhancement process dominated by the material prop-\nerties has greatly enhanced the emission, which results in the\nlarge difference between the two b factors. Furthermore, the\nemission area that is calculated from the F\u2013N plot shown in\nTable I is unrealistically small.\nTo understand this field emission mechanism in more\ndetail, a transmission electron microscope ~TEM! was em-\nployed to study the structure of the material following irra-\ndiation at 204 mJ\/cm2. The resulting cross sectional analysis\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject to AIP lshows strong evidence of columnar growth that is common\nin laser crystallized Si.14 However, the diffraction pattern\nshows different crystal orientations and a diffuse ring indi-\ncating the material to be more microcrystalline in nature as\nopposed to polycrystalline. An analysis of the cross section\nof the excimer laser crystallized Si gives a microstructure\ncomposed of columnar Si nanocrystals around 90 nm in\nheight and around 50 nm in diameter, surrounded by grain\nboundaries. A recent paper by Carey et al.16 suggests that\ninternal field enhancements between 50 and 200 can be ob-\ntained purely due to proximity effects of conducting spheres,\nwhen placed within a dielectrically inhomogeneous medium.\nThe mixed-phase crystallites to grain boundary ratio ob-\nserved in these samples might give rise to such a phenom-\nenon that allows for the high fields to be generated. This\nwould then allow for hot electrons to be generated within the\nlaser crystallized materials which aid electron emission into\nvacuum.\nElectron field emission at low threshold fields from ELC\nsilicon is a very exciting result and we have demonstrated\nemission threshold ~less than 15 V\/mm! which are compa-\nrable to those reported for Si nanowires6 ~15 V\/mm!, to those\nobserved from poly-Si by LPCVD with oxidation\nsharpening7 and poly-Si microtip8 ~20 V\/mm!, to those of\nsingle c-Si microtip17 ~20 V\/mm!. Furthermore, the technolo-\ngies that are discussed in this letter are all mature technolo-\ngies in the display sector, and could readily be incorporated\ninto a working device.\nThe authors would like to thank D.
