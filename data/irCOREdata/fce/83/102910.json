Using current versus voltage measurements, we have\nshown that the current is space-charge-limited, with a mobility value of typically\n10210 cm2 V21 s21. The implantation of boron ions at doses below 631014 cm22 results in an\nincrease in mobility of more than one order of magnitude. Above this dose, the conductivity\nincreases by five orders of magnitude, and the transport mechanism changes to a Frenkel\u2013Poole\ntype conduction process. At an intermediate dose of 231015 ions cm22, the current versus voltage\ncharacteristic exhibits strong hysteresis. The observed hysteresis effects could be removed from one\npolarity by implanting only through the first half of the film. The hysteresis is likely to be due to the\ntrapping of holes at one or both of the interfaces, resulting in the modification of the space-charge\nwithin the polymeric amorphous carbon film. \u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics.\n@DOI: 10.1063\/1.1602953#INTRODUCTION\nFor several years, there has been much interest in the\nmaterial known as hydrogenated amorphous carbon ~a-C:H!,\nboth due to its outstanding mechanical properties, and also\nits potential in electronic applications due to its tunable op-\ntical band gap.1 Various types of this material have been\nproposed as viable alternatives to amorphous silicon for ap-\nplications such as solar cells and thin-film transistors. Fur-\nthermore, thin films of amorphous carbon have been shown\nto exhibit electron field emission,2 so these films may be a\nviable emissive layer for the next generation of flat-panel\ndisplays. However, its electronic properties are limited by the\nfact that, in most forms of the material, the transport at high\nelectric fields (.105 V cm21) is normally governed by the\nfield assisted excitation of carriers which are trapped within\nCoulombic wells, which is known as Frenkel\u2013Poole type\nconduction.3,4 This type of mechanism occurs in materials\nwhich possess a very high defect density, such as in various\nforms of a-C:H where values of approximately 1020 para-\nmagnetic spins cm23 ~Ref. 5! have been observed. Other\nstudies have demonstrated the usability of amorphous carbon\nfor metal-insulator-metal switches6,7 and shown the forma-\ntion of a Schottky barrier between amorphous carbon and\nsome metals.8\nPolymeric amorphous carbon ~PAC! possesses a signifi-\ncantly lower defect density of approximately\n1017 spins cm23, and therefore is more promising as an elec-\ntronic material, as well as also being a viable field-emitting\na!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nriz.khan@ic.ac.uk4470021-8979\/2003\/94(7)\/4470\/7\/$20.00\nloaded 19 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.118. Redistribution subject to AIP lmaterial.9,10 We have demonstrated that the material pos-\nsesses a high resistivity in its as-deposited state, but this may\nbe controllably reduced by ion implantation, which results in\na partial delocalization of the film at low ion doses,11 al-\nthough graphitization occurs above an ion dose of 6\n31014 cm22, which manifests itself as a decrease in optical\nband gap. Previous to this study, the ion implantation of\namorphous carbon has been studied, but only on materials\npossessing a high initial defect density, and extensive sp2\nrestructuring12\u201314 was observed.\nIn this study, we will investigate the transport properties\nof PAC in its as-deposited state, which have been measured\nby fabricating metal-semiconductor-metal diodes. The ef-\nfects of boron ion-implantation will also be observed in order\nto ascertain the optical and electronic processes that are\ninvolved.\nEXPERIMENT\nOur films were deposited on the earthed substrate of an\nrf-plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition reactor at\nroom temperature, which produced polymeric amorphous\ncarbon films with a hydrogen content of ;55 at. %, as mea-\nsured using elastic recoil detection analysis, and a low para-\nmagnetic defect density of ;1017 cm23 ~Ref. 9! as measured\nusing electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The\nfilms were grown onto metallic chromium nitride substrates.\nSome samples were then implanted with boron ions at ener-\ngies of 20 and 26 keV, with projected ranges of 60 and 76\nnm. Metal-semiconductor-metal ~MSM! structures were fab-\nricated by evaporating gold top contacts upon the films,\nwhich possessed a diameter of between 0.25 and 1 mm, and0 \u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\nicense or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\n4471J.

Devices were fabri-\ncated using different contact materials ~Ti, Cr, Al! and it was\nfound that the J \u2013 V characteristics were independent of the\nelectrode.\nWe then measured the electrical characteristics of these\ndevices by performing current versus voltage measurements\nusing a Keithley 487 picoammeter\/voltage source. Measure-\nments were performed parametric in temperature over a\nrange of 300\u2013550 K. Before these measurements were per-\nformed, the sample was annealed at 300 \u00b0C for 5 min in a\nvacuum better than 1025 mbar, in order to ensure tempera-\nture stability. Resistivity values were derived from the slope\nof the J versus E characteristic at electric fields of ,2\n3105 V cm21. Films were also deposited onto Corning\n7059 glass substrates and optical absorption measurements\nwere performed on these samples, in order to measure the\nband gap of the material. The thicknesses of the films were\nderived using ellipsometry, by using a 632.5 nm He\/Ne\nsource, and also confirmed using profilometry.\nRESULTS\nThe current density ~J! versus electric field ~E! of a typi-\ncal 100 nm thick PAC film is shown in Fig. 1~a! as a linear\nplot. This is followed by the same data shown as a logarith-\nmic J versus E plot, and as ln J versus E1\/2 for the positive\nhalf cycle only, in Figs. 1~b! and 1~c!. It can seen from Fig.\n1~a! that up to an electric field of 43105 V cm21 the current\ndensity scales approximately linearly with the electric field\nwhich allows low-field values of resistivity to be calculated.\nFor this film the calculated resistivity is 231015 V cm, and\ncomparable to some of the better insulators available for thin\nfilms. These films have been used as passivation layers for\nhigh voltage power devices due to this property. A linear J\/E\ncharacteristic at these electric fields suggests that electronic\ntransport is occurring either by hopping around the Fermi\nlevel, conduction in the band tails, or conduction through\nextended states,15,16 rather than any of the mechanisms that\napply in the high field, such as space-charge-limited\ncurrent,17 Frenkel\u2013Poole conduction,18 or the Schottky\neffect.19\nIt is shown in Fig. 1~b! that there is a large degree of\nhysteresis in the J\/E characteristic, as when the voltage is\nreduced from the maximum value, the measured current is\nlower than the current which was measured on the ramp-up.\nThis is most likely to be an effect of the capacitance of the\ndevice, and the long time constant which is as a result of the\nhigh resistivity of the film.\nFigure 1~c! plots ln J versus E1\/2, which is the conven-\ntional graph20 for the purpose of fitting to Frenkel\u2013Poole or\nSchottky effect conduction mechanisms. This figure shows\nthat an approximately straight-line region is obtained in the\nE1\/2 range from 400 to 700 V1\/2 cm21\/2. Therefore, it is pos-\nsible that either of these two mechanisms is applicable. The\nanalysis of the slope will be performed in the Discussion.\nFigure 2 shows the characteristics of films grown to dif-\nferent thicknesses in order to check whether conduction is\ncontact or bulk limited.

Redistribution subject to AIP lplotted against V , if the depletion region does not extend\nthroughout the length of the film.21 It can be seen in Fig. 2~a!\nthat the J versus V characteristics do not coincide for the\nthree film thicknesses, which renders a contact-limited con-\nduction process under these conditions unlikely. If either the\nconduction was contact limited but the depletion region ex-\ntended throughout the device, or was governed by a bulk-\nlimited process such as hopping or Frenkel\u2013Poole conduc-\ntion, then the current would scale with the electric field over\nthe device, so the J versus E characteristic would be the same\nfor all film thicknesses. This is plotted in Fig. 2~b!. It can be\nseen that once again the J versus E curves do not coincide for\nthe three film thicknesses.\nA common high-field conduction mechanism in MSM\nstructures is space-charge-limited current ~SCLC! where the\ndependence follows a parabolic relationship which varies ac-\ncording to the density and distribution of states within the\nband gap. Figure 2~c! shows the variation of J\/d against\nV\/d2 on log\u2013log axes for the three film thicknesses to inves-\ntigate if SCLC is governing high-field conduction according\nto the equation shown in the Discussion section.

A slope\nmay be calculated from this line and is found to be 2.0. This\nsuggests a parabolic dependence of current against voltage,\ni.e., J}V2.0, and indicates SCLC at high fields only.\nIn order to observe whether conduction occurred via car-\nriers excited into the extended states, into localized states in\nthe band tail, or by hopping at the Fermi level ~either ther-\nmally activated or variable-range hopping!, J versus E mea-\nsurements were performed as a function of temperature.15\nFigure 3 shows the variation of ln ~conductivity! against\n2q\/kT for a PAC film. It may be observed that at low\n2q\/kT values, corresponding to a measurement temperature\nof less than 100 \u00b0C, there is almost no variation of conduc-\ntivity with temperature, which means that the activation en-\nergy in this range is close to zero. At higher temperatures\n~.110 \u00b0C! a straight-line dependence is observed for ln J\nversus 2q\/kT plot which suggests a thermally activated pro-\ncess which fits the Arrhenius law. From the slope of the\ngraph an activation energy may be determined and the value\nFIG. 2. Current vs voltage characteristics for as deposited PAC films of\ndiffering thicknesses: ~a!

This compares with a Tauc op-\ntical band gap value of 2.6 eV.\nWe will now show the variation in these electrical prop-\nerties as a function of boron ion dose. The J versus E char-\nacteristic of the PAC diodes over the range of boron ion\ndoses is shown in Fig. 4. Apart from the curve at 2\n31015 cm22, the characteristics are symmetrical with the\nmagnitude of the current increasing by many orders of mag-\nnitude as the dose increases. It is interesting to note that a\nlarge range in conductivity may be achieved over a narrow\ndose range, indicating that the predominant reordering and\nincrease in conductivity occurs over this range. Furthermore,\nthe film implanted at 231015 cm22 shows asymmetry which\nmanifests itself as increased hysteresis in the negative sweep.\nFigure 5 shows the J versus E characteristics for two\nfilms implanted at a dose of 231015 cm22 with as-deposited\nthicknesses of 120 and 190 nm, respectively. Following im-\nplantation the thicknesses had reduced to 80 and 104 nm.\nUpon applying a positive voltage to the top contact, the cur-\nrent increases and there is a pronounced hysteresis with a\nlarger current on the return sweep to zero voltage. Also, it\ncan be seen that in the positive sweep the 80 nm thick film is\none order of magnitude higher in conductivity than the 104\nnm thick film; however, the characteristics are similar with\nhysteresis resulting in a current enhancement. The negative\nsweep shows an even larger degree of hysteresis in the 80\nnm thick film and no hysteresis in the 104 nm thick film.\nFIG. 3.

Phys., Vol. 94, No. 7, 1 October 2003 R. Khan and S. Silva\nDownTherefore, the 104 nm thick film shows hysteresis in one\nsweep only which results in rectification of approximately\none order of magnitude.\nIt was thought that the behavior of trapped carriers might\nbe influencing the current density of these films, as this type\nof hysteresis might be expected if carriers are trapped and\ndecay with a long time constant. Therefore, current versus\ntime measurements were performed at varying voltages for\nthe sample implanted with boron ions at 231015 cm22. The\nresulting characteristics are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen\nthat up to an applied voltage of 3 V, the current decays with\ntime in a manner which might be expected if the device is\nconsidered as a parallel-plate capacitor. However, above the\nvoltage of 3 V ~which coincides with voltages above the\nswitching electric field of the film! the current shows an in-\ncrease with time. This is perhaps surprising as it is not com-\nmonly observed in most dielectric materials.\nIn order to supplement the electrical data, measurements\nwere performed as a function of temperature up to 160 \u00b0C,\nwhich is shown in Fig. 7. It may be observed that between\nmeasurement temperatures of 23 to 80 \u00b0C, the current density\ndecreases by approximately one order of magnitude; in other\nwords, the film possesses a negative activation energy of\n0.560.05 eV. A negative activation energy has seldom been\nreported in the literature for thin-film materials. At higher\nFIG. 5.

Redistribution subject to AIP ltemperatures the activation energy becomes positive with a\nvalue of 0.3260.03 eV. This coincides with a reduction in\nhysteresis up to the measurement temperature of 80 \u00b0C,\nwhich is not shown in the plot for the purposes of clarity.\nAbove 80 \u00b0C there is no longer any hysteresis in the J\/E\ncharacteristic.\nDISCUSSION\nIt can be seen in Fig. 1 that the current rise with applied\nvoltage is linear at low fields and that the characteristics\nshow a large degree of hysteresis which suggests either a\nlarge contribution of device capacitance or trapping. It has\nbeen observed that as the time interval between measure-\nments is increased between 0.5 s per 0.1 V measurement step\nto 2 s per measurement step, the degree of hysteresis is seen\nto decrease. This suggests that there is an initial increase in\ncurrent as the voltage is increased which decays as the mea-\nsurement time is increased, which would suggest a capacitive\neffect. Assuming C5Ae0er \/d and R5rd\/A , the time con-\nstant RC5re0er . If er52.6, i.e., the square of the refractive\nindex, and r5231015 V cm, then the calculated time con-\nstant is approximately 460 s. Therefore, over the time of\nmeasurement performed here, a considerable residual voltage\ncaused by the capacitance of the device (VC) exists over the\ndevice due to stepping up to the maximum voltage value\neven as the measurement voltage (VM) is then stepped back\ndown to zero. Therefore, the overall voltage across the film is\nlower than the applied voltage due to the capacitance contri-\nbution, as VTOT5VM2VC , and this in turn is most likely to\naccount for the hysteresis. In order to obtain an accurate\nanalysis of the hysteresis we need to conduct extensive C-V\nanalysis as a function of frequency. But, preliminary results\ngive a flat response with voltage that indicates no change in\nthe depletion region width with bias, and capacitance values\nclose to those calculated using the above equation, for the\nthree film thicknesses.\nIn order to ascertain whether high-field conduction may\nbe governed by Frenkel\u2013Poole or Schottky conduction, it is\nnecessary to investigate Fig. 1~c!. The Frenkel\u2013Poole and\nSchottky equations are as follows, respectively:22,21\nFIG. 7.

Therefore, it is\nhighly unlikely that the Frenkel\u2013Poole effect governs the\nconduction process within these films. The Schottky effect is\nalso unlikely as in this case a slope of b\/2 would yield a\ndielectric constant value of approximately 28, which is also\nfar higher than the expected value. Furthermore, the fact that\nthe measurements are independent of the choice of electrode\nindicates that the characteristics are not contact-limited.\nSCLC has been used in order to fit to the J\/E character-\nistics to obtain the density of states within the band gap.23,24\nHowever, in the case of this material, the trap density is not\nas high as in the case of previously observed a-C:H films and\ntherefore a simpler analysis assuming either a trap-free ma-\nterial or a material with a density of shallow traps will suf-\nfice. The equation for SCLC is17\nJ5\n9me0er\n8d E\n2\n, ~4!\nwhere m is the carrier mobility, er is the relative permittivity,\ne0 is the permittivity of free space, and d is the film thick-\nness. It can be seen that for different thicknesses J\/d will be\nproportional to V\/d2 with a slope of 2 when plotted on log\u2013\nlog axes. This is shown in Fig. 2~c! where it can be seen that\nthe curves appear to coincide in the high-field region. The\nslope of this section is 2.0 which is a remarkable result when\ncompared to the theoretical value. As has been previously\nstated the low-field conduction follows a linear dependence\nwith voltage and this would explain the deviation from the fit\nto SCLC at lower electric fields.\nAssuming a value of er to be 2.6 ~the square of the\nrefractive index!, by fitting to the equation, a mobility value\nof 1.2310210 cm2 V21 s21 is derived, which is extremely\nlow when compared to other semiconducting films, for ex-\nample a-Si:H which possesses a room temperature mobility\nof the order of 1 cm2 V21 s21.16 The mobility of ta-C has\nbeen derived by Clough et al.25 from measurements of a\nfield-effect transistor to be in the order of\n;1026 cm2 V21 s21. However, the resistivity of ta-C is\ncommonly in the order of 107 V cm21 ~Ref. 26! which is far\nlower than the measured value for PAC films in this study,loaded 19 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.118. Redistribution subject to AIP l;1015 V cm21. The J-V properties of PAC coupled with its\nlow mobility indicate either a trap-free case where the den-\nsity of transport sites is low, or the case where the mobility is\nstrongly reduced by trapping, resulting in a reduction in the\nfree charge to trapped charge ratio. The low paramagnetic\ndefect density of PAC of ;1017 spins cm23 ~Ref. 9! would\nindicate the former in this case. The low mobility of carriers\nin PAC films therefore results in the high resistivity values\nwhich are observed.\nThe negligible value of Eact for the earthed electrode\ngrown films below 100 \u00b0C, as shown in Fig. 3, suggests that\nany strongly thermally activated mechanism such as ex-\ntended state or band tail conduction is ruled out for PAC\nfilms at room temperature, and therefore conduction at these\ntemperatures and low electric fields is dominated by hop-\nping. It has been suggested21 that in the absence of an acti-\nvation energy, the majority of carriers would be condensed in\ntraps or donor sites. If the centers are closely spaced, the\ncarriers may tunnel between nearest neighbor sites, which is\nknown as tunnel hopping. Due to the lack of any clear tem-\nperature dependence, and also the fact that due to the high\nresistivity of the films any variation is within the experimen-\ntal error of the measurement apparatus, it is not possible in\nour case to ascertain whether this type of hopping dominates\nor another mechanism.\nAt higher temperatures the value of Eact has been shown\nfrom Fig. 3 to be approximately 0.7 eV. The most likely\nmechanism is the transport of carriers excited to localized\nstates at the band edges, otherwise known as band-tail con-\nduction, as one would expect a change from hopping to\nband-tail conduction as the temperature was increased, rather\nthan a transition directly to transport in the extended states.\nThe value of band gap obtained from the Tauc method is\napproximately 2.5 eV. Therefore, assuming that the Tauc\nmethod describes the energy gap between the band edges\nassuming that they are parabolic, the Fermi level is not at\nmidgap but at 0.7 eV from one of the band edges. Previous\nstudies have shown that intrinsically grown a-C is p-type27\nand an explanation for this is that the dangling bond defect in\ncarbon has a lowered energy leading to p-type conductivity.\nIn this case, it is therefore more likely that the 0.7 eV acti-\nvation energy represents the energy difference between the\nFermi level and the valence rather than the conduction band\nedge.\nThe J versus E characteristics as a function of ion dose\nare shown in Fig. 4. Apart from the curve at 231015 cm22\nthe characteristics are symmetric and this indicates bulk-\nlimited conduction. The J\/E at the lowest doses are consis-\ntent with space-charge-limited currents in the bulk of the\nfilm,17 with the high field regime showing an approximately\nparabolic J versus E relationship, as described earlier. The\nlarge increase in conductivity with increasing boron dose is\nattributed to a number of factors related to restructuring and\ndefect creation during ion bombardment. It is known that ion\ndamage increases the amount of disorder in the amorphous\nsilicon alloys which increases the strength of the band tails\nand reduces the effective band gap.28 A similar effect is ex-\npected in amorphous carbon, but in addition any change in\nthe proportion and distribution of sp2 and sp3 bonding dur-icense or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\n4475J.

Earlier it has also been\nshown that there is an onset for sp2 reordering, which is in\nthe range of 101421015 cm22.\nFor implantations at a dose of 631014 cm22 and below,\nthe J\/E characteristic remains parabolic which suggests\nSCLC, even though the conductivity has increased over four\norders of magnitude. Applying Eq. ~4! yields a mobility\nvalue of approximately 231029 cm2 V21 s21 for the film\nimplanted at a dose of 631014 cm22. This is an increase of\nover one order of magnitude when compared to the unim-\nplanted case. Therefore, the increase in current magnitude up\nto a dose of 631014 cm22 may be attributed to an increase\nin low field conductivity, coupled with an increase in mobil-\nity which manifests itself at higher fields.\nWe have previously shown a very strong dose depen-\ndence of the band gap and spin density as determined using\nelectron paramagnetic resonance, with the band gap falling\nfrom its initial value of 2.6 to 0.4 eV at the highest dose, and\nthe spin density increasing from an initial value of ;1017 to\na final value of ;1020 cm23.11 Therefore, as the ion dose\nincreases, there is a narrowing of the band gap, an increase in\ndefect density, and an increase in the doping concentration.\nAll these features promote the transport of carriers via the\nFrenkel\u2013Poole effect. Indeed, at the highest dose, the J\/E\ncharacteristics are well described by the hopping of carriers\nbetween defect states in the bulk of the film, as a straight line\nlog J\/E versus E1\/2 relationship is observed, which is consis-\ntent with Frenkel\u2013Poole conduction.29 Since this film is\nheavily doped, it seems reasonable to assume that the current\nis due to transport between charged defect centers.\nThe samples implanted at a dose of 231015 cm22 with\nthicknesses of 80 and 104 nm have been shown in Fig. 5.\nHere, the Tauc optical gap is 1.3 eV and Frenkel\u2013Poole con-\nduction appears not to apply, as the calculation performed\npreviously reveals a permittivity value of about 50, far\nhigher than that expected. The presence of hysteresis at the\nintermediate dose indicates that we have a trapping effect.\nDuring the first positive sweep, electrons would be injected\nfrom the bottom contact and holes from the top contact. One\npossible explanation is that the trapping of holes may en-\nhance the electron current. If so, the number of trapped holes\nwill depend on the magnitude of the positive voltage applied\nto the top current and how long the voltage is applied.\nChanging any one of these parameters was found to change\nthe size of the loop. On reducing the positive voltage back to\nzero, holes would be expected to remain trapped so the elec-\ntron current would also be higher on the way down than on\nthe way up, leading to a loop in the characteristic, as is\nobserved. Similarly, for the 80 nm thick sample the negative\ncharacteristic shows loop behavior. This would also be con-\nsistent with the above hypothesis, though this time the holes\nwill be trapped from the back contact.\nFurther evidence for a current enhancement due to a\ntrapping process is shown in the current versus time mea-\nsurement as shown in Fig. 6. In this case, it has been ob-\nserved that for low applied voltages the measured current\ndensity decreases with time. This is consistent with a capaci-\ntive effect which, when the curve is fitted to an exponentialloaded 19 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.118. Redistribution subject to AIP ldecay, yields a time constant value of approximately 1 s.\nApplying C5Ae0er \/d and R5rd\/A , the theoretical time\nconstant for this device is re0er which has been calculated to\nbe 0.2 s. However, at higher measurement voltages, the time\nconstant increases until a voltage of 3 V at which the current\nincreases rather than decreases with time. This may be ex-\nplained if the trapping of carriers causes an increases in cur-\nrent magnitude, and the process is less significant at low\nmeasurement voltages where it merely counteracts the ca-\npacitive decay of the current. At higher measurement volt-\nages, as the voltage is applied, more carriers are trapped\nwhich causes a further increase in current over time.\nFurthermore, as shown in Fig. 7, below a measurement\ntemperature of 80 \u00b0C, as the measurement temperature is in-\ncreased the current magnitude decreases. Should the current\nbe enhanced by trapping, an increase in temperature is likely\nto depopulate these traps via a thermionic emission mecha-\nnism. It has been mentioned that above a measurement tem-\nperature of 80 \u00b0C, the hysteresis is absent and the current at\nhigher temperatures then increases with temperature. Above\nthis temperature, therefore, the measurements are consistent\nwith the model assuming that there are no longer any trapped\ncarriers which cause the current enhancement.\nThe relationship between the trapping of carriers and the\npresence of loops in the J\/E characteristic is supported by\nthe data shown above for the 104 nm thick film. In this case,\nthe boron ions were unable to penetrate to the bottom part of\nthe film when implanted with the same energy and dose as\nabove. In the negative voltage segment, the current enhance-\nment and hysteresis are missing, and therefore the device\nshows rectification of approximately one order of magnitude.\nThis may be interpreted as an absence of hole trapping from\nthe bottom contact into the unbombarded part of the a-C:H\nfilm. The reverse current is therefore unmodified by the pres-\nence of holes. The fact that the hysteresis occurs for the\npositive but not the negative sweep suggests that it is the\nmovement of holes through the material from the positively\nbiased contact that is important rather than the presence of\nboron atoms that modify the space charge. If the latter was\nthe case then we would have hysteresis in both directions for\nthe partially implanted layer. These results also indicate the\nholes are the trapped carriers rather than the electrons, due to\nthe polarity of the hysteresis.\nOur model for the process described for the above film\nassumes that conduction remains space-charge limited.\nTherefore, hole trapping will have the effect of reducing the\nmagnitude of the negative space charge within the film, and\nwill therefore increase the magnitude of the electron current.\nThis will only occur if there were centers to trap holes in the\nmaterial, for example due to ion-implantation damage, and\nthere was a significant electric field, in order for sufficient\nhole injection to occur. Such a model is shown in Fig. 8. If\nthere are no centers that trap holes, then the space charge\nwould remain unperturbed and hence no current increase and\nhysteresis would be observed. This appears to be the case in\nthe 104 nm thick film, where the absence of current enhance-\nment in the negative voltage sweep suggests insufficient cen-\nters to allow hole trapping from the bottom contact.icense or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\n4476 J.

Silva\nDownCONCLUSION\nPolymeric amorphous carbon films have been shown to\nexhibit low-field room-temperature conduction most closely\nresembling hopping conduction with a very low activation\nenergy. At higher temperatures, the variation of conductivity\nwith temperature suggests that the Fermi level is 0.7 eV from\nthe valence band edge. Conduction at higher electric fields\nmost closely resembles trap-free space-charge-limited cur-\nrent. This is expected, due to the wide band gap and low\ndefect density of the material. We observe that the implanta-\ntion of boron into this material changes the conductivity of a\nMSM diode by over eight orders of magnitude. For low and\nhigh doses the J\/E characteristics are symmetrical about\nzero voltage which indicates that the current is determined\nby bulk effects in the film, and the current remains space-\ncharge limited for the lowest boron doses. An increase in the\nboron dose increases the amount of damage, changes the\nbalance of the sp2\/sp3 content, and therefore reduces the\nband gap, and there is a corresponding increase in the con-\nductivity via Frenkel\u2013Poole type conduction.\nBipolar effects have been observed at an intermediate\nion dose, which manifest themselves in the current enhance-\nment with applied electric field and hysteresis in the J\/E\ncharacteristic. J\/E versus temperature and current versus\ntime measurements have suggested that the trapping of car-\nriers results in an enhancement of current magnitude which\nis both voltage and temperature dependent. The dependence\non the back contact and film thickness suggests that holes\nrather than electrons are trapped which causes a modification\nof the electron current. A model based on a current enhance-\nment due to the reduction in space charge within the film has\nbeen postulated. This phenomenon has not been previously\nobserved and may be of significance for understanding how\nFIG. 8.
