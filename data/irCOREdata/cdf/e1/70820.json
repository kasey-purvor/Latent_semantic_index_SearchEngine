Introduction\nIt has been established [1] that, on a timescale of the average circulation period (\u223c1\nminute in humans) many physiological signals associated with blood flow exhibit\nfive spectral peaks at characteristic frequencies that are approximately the same for\ndifferent measurement sites and different individuals. It may reasonably be inferred\nthat these peaks arise from underlying oscillatory processes involved in the blood\ncirculation and its regulatory mechanisms. Their probable physiological attribu-\ntions are given in Table 1. The origins of the two higher frequencies are obvious:\nthey relate to the cardiac and respiratory processes. The origins of the other three\nfrequencies are less well established, but they appear to be derived respectively\nfrom: the intrinsic myogenic activity of smooth muscle [2\u20134]; autonomous nervous\nPublished in Fluct. Noise Lett. 3, L167-176 (2003).\nP.V.E. McClintock and A. Stefanovska\nTable 1.

These latter three pro-\ncesses relate to control mechanisms that adjust the radii of the blood vessels, and\nthus are distributed throughout the whole body. It is found that the frequencies\nand amplitudes of the oscillations vary in time, apparently because their mutual\ninteractions give rise to modulation and episodic synchronization [9].\nIn Sec. 2 we consider the cardio-respiratory interaction and the episodes of syn-\nchronization to which it gives rise. More recently, attempts have been made to seek\nevidence for synchronization phenomena involving the myogenic (\u223c0.1 Hz) process,\nand we discuss these in Sec. 3. The relationship between modulation and synchro-\nnization \u2013 which in practice are competing processes \u2013 is discussed in Sec. 4. Finally,\nin Sec. 5 we summarize the status of present understanding, draw conclusions, and\ntry to point the way forward.\n2. Cardio-respiratory Synchronization\nThe electrical activity that initiates the contraction of the heart originates at the\nsino-atrial node, and this periodicity has consequently been called the sinus rhythm.\nIn adapting continuously to the needs of the body, the heart alters its rate and this\nalteration is known as sinus arrhythmia. Variability of the heart rate is extensively\nstudied because of its potential for providing noninvasive measures of cardiovas-\ncular control mechanisms [10]. However, neither the physiological mechanisms of\ninteraction, nor their dynamical properties, are fully understood.\nVariations in the heart rate and the amplitude of its contraction can be at-\ntributed to a continuous interaction between the oscillatory processes involved in\nblood distribution [1]. The existence of an interaction between the cardiac and res-\npiratory functions has been known since the 18th century when Hales carried out\nR\ne\ns\np\nir\na\nti\no\nn inspiration\nexpiration\nH\ne\na\nrt\n r\na\nte\nTime [s]0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nTime [s]0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nFig 1. The measured variation of heart rate (bottom) with respiration (top). During spontaneous\nrespiration the heart rate increases during inspiration and decreases during expiration.\nInteractions & synchronization in the cardiovascular system\nhis celebrated experiments [11] on a horse. He found that the heart rate increased\non inspiration and decreased on expiration, as shown in Fig. 1. This frequency\nmodulation phenomenon, known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia, has been studied\nextensively [12\u201316] since then. It has also been recognized that the respiratory func-\ntion can modify the amplitude of cardiac oscillations (stroke volume) [17]. Traube\nin 1865 and Hering in 1869 independently observed waves in systemic blood pres-\nsure associated [18] with respiration. Their presence in blood pressure and flow\nsignals [4, 5, 7, 8] illustrates the propagation of the oscillations through the cardio-\nvascular system [19].\nIf respiration and heart beat are regarded as oscillators, then their mutual in-\nteraction may be expected to result in an adjustment of their rhythms, sometimes\nleading to synchronization. Early studies [20\u201324] considered temporal coordina-\ntion between cardiac and respiratory rates: joint interval histograms were plotted\nand integer ratios of frequency and distinct phase preference were analysed. An\nn:1 synchronization of the rhythms was found in an\u00e6sthetized rabbits [20, 21] and\nin humans in various sleep stages, at rest, during physical work [22\u201324], and in\nan\u00e6sthesia [25, 26]. It was also concluded [27] that the rhythms are generally not\nphase-locked, implying that the cardiorespiratory coupling is relatively weak \u2013 or\nthat the disruptive effects of random fluctuations (noise) are relatively strong.\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nTime (s)\n\u03a8\n1\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n2\n4\n6\n8\nTime (s)\nf h\/\nf r\n\u03a8\n1\nf h\/\nf r\n\u03a8\n1\nf h\/\nf r\nFig 2. Top: cardiorespiratory synchrogram for a patient in coma. The absence of horizontal\nsections of \u03a81 indicates the corresponding absence of synchronization episodes. Bottom: ratio of\nthe cardiac fh and respiratory fr frequencies, showing that it remains almost constant with time.\nThe introduction of nonlinear methods, and the concepts of generalised and\nphase synchronization, further illuminated the problem and confirmed that car-\ndiorespiratory synchronization usually occurs as brief episodes [28, 29]. Use of the\nsynchrogram and synchronization index facilitated the detection of synchronization\neven where both frequencies were time-varying. It was found that the synchro-\nnization episodes in healthy subjects at rest were \u223c10 times longer (\u223c1000 s) in\nathletes [28, 29] than in non-athletes [30] and, furthermore, that their length de-\npended inversely on the average depth of the frequency modulation of the heart\nrate. From the latter result it may reasonably be inferred that the inter-oscillator\nP.V.E. McClintock and A. Stefanovska\ncoupling strength, as revealed by the lengths of the synchronization episodes, con-\nstitutes a useful piece of information about the state of the organism. This idea is\napparently confirmed by measurements on a critically ill patient in coma. As shown\nin Fig. 2, there is absolutely no sign of synchronization: the synchrogram indicates\ncontinuous phase slippage, even though the ratio of the cardiac and respiratory\nfrequencies remains almost constant.\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03bb 1\n,2\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03bb 1\n,3\n0 10 20 30 40\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03bb 1\n,5\nTime  (min)\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03bb 1\n,4\n2pi\n\u03a8\n1\npi\n0\nFig 3. Synchronization phenomena in an an\u00e6sthetized rat. The an\u00e6sthetic is administered at\ntime = -3 min, on the left hand side. The upper panel presents the cardiorespiratory synchrogram,\nshowing the occurrence of transitions between 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5 synchronization states as\ntime evolves. The an\u00e6sthesia is at its deepest at \u223c40 minutes. The lower four panels show the\nsynchronization indices \u03bb1,n; perfect 1:n synchronization is indicated by \u03bb1,n = 1.\nAnother physiological state where synchronization phenomena are of particular\nimportance is that of ana\u00e6sthesia [31]. The synchronization state in a rat is then\ntypically as shown in the measurements of Fig. 3. Data recording can be initiated as\nsoon as the an\u00e6sthetic has taken effect, at time = 0 on the left hand side. Initially\nthere is 1:2 synchronization, as shown by the synchrogram and by the relevant\nsynchronization index \u03bb1,2 being close to unity. As time evolves, the ana\u00e6sthesia\ndeepens, and the system passes through a hierarchy of different synchronization\nstates. During deepest ana\u00e6sthesia (20\u201340 minutes), the system remains locked into\n1:5 synchronization. This process is usually reversible [31], passing back through\nthe same set of synchronization states as the an\u00e6sthetic wears off.\nThere is an additional very interesting change that occurs in the cardiorespira-\ntory interaction of rats during an\u00e6sthesia. Measurements were made as described\npreviously [31], but the directionality index [32\u201335] of the cardiorespiratory cou-\nInteractions & synchronization in the cardiovascular system\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n0\n5\n10\nf h\/\nf r\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\nd r\n,h\nTime  (min)\nFig 4. Changes in the cardiorespiratory interaction in an an\u00e6sthetised rat. Top: the ratio of the\ncardiac fh and respiratory fr frequencies. Bottom: the directionality index dr,h. When dr,h > 0,\nthe direction of the interaction is such that respiration drives the heart; when dr,h < 0, the heart\nis driving the respiratory process, as evidently occurs at the end of deep an\u00e6sthesia.\npling dr,h was calculated from the data. It is plotted in Fig. 4. As the an\u00e6sthetic\ntakes effect, dr,h quickly rises towards unity, and remains there until consciousness\nstarts to return again. Thus, notwithstanding the changes in the cardiac\/respiratory\nfrequency ratio fh\/fr (top), and the sequence of synchronization states being tra-\nversed, we may conclude that during deep an\u00e6sthesia respiration drives the heart,\nas occurs during the waking state, but in the shallower an\u00e6sthesia that starts after\n\u223c70 minutes respiration is driven by the heart. This observation is not yet under-\nstood but if the same phenomenon occurs in humans, as seems likely, then there\nis obvious potential in using the directionality index as a noninvasive measure of\ndepth of an\u00e6sthesia. Full details will be published elsewhere [36].\n3. Synchronization Involving the Lower Frequency Oscillators\nGiven the interesting information flowing from studies of cardiorespiratory synchro-\nnization, it is natural to consider the possibility of similar phenomena between other\npairs of the five oscillators. This is a challenging question, for several reasons. One\nis the practical upper limit of \u223c30 minutes on the length of time series that can\nbe recorded under stationary conditions, i.e. such that the subject remains suffi-\nciently relaxed for the cardiovascular system not to undergo large transients during\nrecording. For the lowest frequency oscillator (\u223c0.01 Hz) this includes too few com-\nplete periods to obtain good statistics in measuring a spectral density, or to answer\nunambiguously whether or not synchronization exists.\nThere is also another quite separate problem. For the heart and respiration, sep-\narate signals are available, and these can be compared and tested for synchronization\nof their oscillations using the standard methods mentioned above for treating bivari-\nate data. There is no noninvasive method for acquiring a separate signal from any\nof the other three oscillators, however, so that it is necessary to seek synchroniza-\ntion information in univariate data (a single signal). Methods proposed for doing\nso include: (i) decomposition into principle modes or bandpass filtration of the uni-\nP.V.E. McClintock and A. Stefanovska\nvariate data to synthesize two, or more \u201csignals\u201d [19] that can then be analyzed\nusing standard methods [9]; (ii) the use [37] of angles maps [38]; and (iii) bispectral\nanalysis [39]. All of these approaches indicate that the myogenic (\u223c0.1 Hz) oscilla-\ntions (Mayer waves [18] in the blood pressure) can sometimes become synchronized\nwith respiration.\nAlthough no observation of synchronization involving the neurogenic or endothe-\nlial oscillations has been reported, we comment that these oscillations must be of\na kind that are capable of becoming synchronized. The very fact that they can be\nobserved [1] in centrally measured quantities such as the heart rate variability signal\n(derived from the ECG, or the blood pressure) implies that there must be episodes,\nat least, of global synchronization between many of the spatially distributed oscil-\nlators of a particular frequency. Otherwise, if their phases were totally incoherent,\nthe oscillations would average out and no spectral peak would be detected.\nFig 5. Instantaneous cardiac frequency fh (top) in an an\u00e6sthetised rat, determined as the inverse of\nthe time between consecutive R-peaks in the ECG signal. The instantaneous respiratory frequency\nfr (bottom) is determined as the inverse of the time between two consecutive maxima in the\nrespiratory signal. The same frequency can be observed in a wavelet transform of fh (middle),\nand its second harmonic is clearly evident during 20\u201340 min. Modulation of the cardiac frequency\nby the respiratory rhythm coexists with synchronization (Fig. 3). The spikes in the fh, resulting\nfrom ectopic heart beats, significantly disturb the frequency spectrum.\n4. Synchronization versus Modulation\nWhere the coupling between the oscillators is strong, it can give rise to either strong\nmodulation or strong synchronization; but these are to a large extent competing\nInteractions & synchronization in the cardiovascular system\nprocesses. By analogy with the classical theory of synchronization [40], one may\ninfer that the coupling gives rise to synchronization if the parameters place the\nworking point within an Arnold tongue but that, otherwise, it produces modulation.\nThe cardio-respiratory interaction however seems to function in a more complex\nway. In spite of long periods of stable n:1 synchronization (Fig. 3), strong unidirec-\ntional driving of the respiration by the heart is observed at the same time (Fig. 4).\nMoreover, the frequency modulation of the heart by respiration can also be detected\nduring an\u00e6sthesia (Fig. 5). The fact that this respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)\ndoes not vanish even during strong unidirectional driving and synchronization may\nbe interpreted in at least two ways. (a) Two or more types of coupling may coexist\nbetween the cardiac and respiratory systems. The driving of the heart by respiration\nmay be based on information from stretch receptors in the lungs. Moreover, res-\npiratory periodicity has been found in muscle sympathetic nerve recordings, which\nmight account for the respiration-synchronous oscillations in the peripheral blood\nflow [1]. This may result in oscillations in total peripheral resistance as well, causing\ncorresponding oscillations of the heart rate. A direct mechanical coupling between\nrespiration and cardiac function has also been proposed [15]. Although there is not\nyet a clear understanding of the cardiorespiratory interaction, two different cou-\npling mechanisms have often been reported. Sinus arrhythmia appears to persist\nat all levels of cognition, whereas phase coupling is seen best during relaxation,\nsleep and an\u00e6sthesia [25]. (b) Our result may also be taken as an illustration that\ncardiovascular regulation involves more than two rhythms.\n5. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, synchronization phenomena and the frequency (and amplitude) mod-\nulation the cardiovascular system can provide information about the couplings be-\ntween its oscillatory processes. These are important because they characterize the\nstate of the system, being stronger in athletes than sedentary individuals, and\nundetectably weak in a critically ill patient. An important future aim must be\nthe development of a coupled oscillator model with parameters inferred from the\ndata, thereby quantifying the couplings, and some initial progress has already been\nachieved [41].\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported by the Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and\nSport, Joy Welch Trust (UK), the EPSRC (UK) and INTAS.
