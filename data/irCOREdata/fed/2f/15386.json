Biswapped networks.\nConnectivity. Hamiltonicity. Cayley graphs.\n1 Introduction\nInterconnection networks play an ever-increasing role in computers and computa-\ntion. For example: they are used to facilitate communication between processors\nin distributed-memory multiprocessors (such as the supercomputers in the IBM\nBlue Gene project); they are increasingly replacing buses and crossbars in net-\nwork switches and routers; they feature widely in computer systems as a means\nby which to connect I\/O devices with processors and memory; and they are core\nto on-chip networks. As technology advances, interconnection networks need to\nbe implemented on a smaller and smaller scale, so that they connect more and\nmore components and enable faster and more data intensive communications.\nThere are numerous factors which influence the choice of interconnection net-\nwork, including topology, flow control, routing, traffic patterns and packaging\n(see, for example, [2]). As regards the last of these factors, one cannot ignore\nthe physical implementation of an interconnection network and, in particular, the\nactual physical locations of the \u2018wires\u2019 which constitute the interconnection net-\nwork. It is known that over a distance of greater than a few millimetres, optical\nconnections out-perform electronic connections in terms of power consumption,\nspeed and crosstalk [6, 7, 10]. Based on these observations, interconnection net-\nworks known as Optical Transpose Interconnection Systems (OTIS) were devised\nwhere extra optical connections are added to (existing) electronic networks (OTIS\nnetworks originated in [11] but their study was initiated within the computer ar-\nchitecture community in [16] and independently, under the name of swapped net-\nworks, in [17, 18, 19]).\nOTIS networks have a base graph G, on n vertices, and consist of n disjoint\ncopies ofG. These copies are labelledG1, G2, . . . , Gn and the vertices of any copy\nare v1, v2, . . . , vn. The edges involved in any one of these copies of G are intended\nto model (shorter) electronic connections whereas additional edges, where there\nis an edge from vertex vi of copy Gj to vertex vj of copy Gi, for every i, j \u2208\n{1, 2, . . . , n}, with i 6= j, are intended to model the (longer) optical connections.\nThe resulting OTIS network is denoted by OTIS-G. Of course, an OTIS network\nis dependent upon its base graph G, and numerous results have been proven for\nboth specific base graphs and classes of base graphs (see, for example, the papers\n[1, 3, 4, 12] and the references therein).\nOne slightly displeasing aspect of OTIS networks is that no matter what the\nbase graph G is, the corresponding OTIS network OTIS-G cannot be a Cayley\ngraph, or even a vertex-transitive graph, as an OTIS network is not regular. In\ngeneral, if the base graph G has some aspect of symmetry then we lose this\n2\nsymmetry in the graph OTIS-G, and as well as losing desirable specific prop-\nerties, like vertex-transitivity, the loss of this symmetry can make general net-\nwork analysis more problematic. In order to \u2018recapture\u2019 symmetric aspects of\nOTIS networks, Xiao, Parhami, Chen, He and Wei [20] have recently proposed\nbiswapped networks which, they claim, are \u2018fully symmetric and have cluster\nconnectivity very similar to OTIS networks\u2019. The biswapped network Bsw(G)\nis defined very similarly to the OTIS network OTIS-G except that instead of hav-\ning n copies of the base graph G (where G has n vertices), we have 2n copies\nG01, G\n0\n2, . . . , G\n0\nn, G\n1\n1, G\n1\n2, . . . , G\n1\nn and the \u2018optical\u2019 edges join vertex vi in G0j with\nvertex vj in G1i , where i, j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. Immediately we see that if G is reg-\nular then the biswapped network Bsw(G) is regular and so there is some hope\nfor recapturing any symmetric properties of the base graph G. In [20], convinc-\ning arguments are made as to the efficacy of biswapped networks and some basic\nproperties of biswapped networks are derived relating to shortest paths and routing\nalgorithms.\nIn this paper, we further extend the structural analysis of a biswapped network\nBsw(G). We provide a systematic construction of \u03ba + 1 vertex-disjoint paths\njoining any two distinct vertices in Bsw(G), where \u03ba \u2265 1 is the connectivity of\nG. In doing so, we obtain an upper bound on the (\u03ba + 1)-diameter of Bsw(G)\nof max{2\u2206(G) + 5,\u2206\u03ba(G) + \u2206(G) + 2}, where \u2206(G) is the diameter of G and\n\u2206\u03ba(G) the \u03ba-diameter (in [20] it was merely observed, without explanation, that\nBsw(G) has connectivity at least \u03ba+1). As a corollary, we obtain that if G is reg-\nular of degree \u03ba and has connectivity \u03ba then Bsw(G) has connectivity \u03ba + 1 and\nthe wide-diameter of Bsw(G) is bounded above by 2\u2206\u03ba(G) + 3. Furthermore,\nwe prove that if G is connected and has minimal degree d then G has connectivity\nat least d + 1 and \u2206\u03ba+1(Bsw(G)) is at most 3\u2206(G) + 6. Suppose that we have\na deterministic multipath source routing algorithm in an interconnection network\nG that finds \u03ba mutually vertex-disjoint paths in G joining any 2 distinct vertices\nand does this in time polynomial in \u2206\u03ba(G), \u2206(G) and \u03ba (and independently of\nthe number of vertices of G). Our constructions yield a simple deterministic mul-\ntipath source routing algorithm in the interconnection network Bsw(G) that finds\n\u03ba+ 1 mutually vertex-disjoint paths joining any 2 distinct vertices in Bsw(G) so\nthat these paths all have length bounded as above. Moreover, our algorithm has\ntime complexity polynomial in \u2206\u03ba(G), \u2206(G) and \u03ba. We also show that if G is\nHamiltonian then Bsw(G) is Hamiltonian, and that if G is a Cayley graph then\nBsw(G) is a Cayley graph (these results were reported in [20] but not proven). In\naddition, we show that if G is a Cayley graph of the group \u0393 then Bsw(G) is a\nCayley graph of the group that is the wreath product of \u0393 with the cyclic group of\n3\norder 2.\nWe present the background and definitions relating to this paper in Section 2,\nbefore showing that Bsw(G) is Hamiltonian if G is and that Bsw(G) is a Cayley\ngraph if G is in Section 3. Our main results, relating to the (\u03ba + 1)-diameter of\nBsw(G) and the subsequent deterministic multipath source routing algorithm, are\nin Section 4, with our conclusions and directions for further research in Section 5.\n2 Basic definitions\nWe give here the basic graph-theoretic definitions relevant to this paper. All graphs\nare undirected and for any graph-theoretic terminology not defined here, we re-\nfer the reader to [5]. We also explain why certain graph parameters are relevant\nwhen a graph forms the interconnection network of a distributed-memory multi-\nprocessor (with the processors located at vertices and the edges corresponding to\ndirect communication links between pairs of processors). On occasion when we\nare referring to a graph as an interconnection network, we talk about processors\nand links rather than vertices and edges. The reader is referred to [8] and [21] for\nmore on interconnection networks.\nA path in a graph is a sequence of distinct vertices so that there is an edge\njoining consecutive vertices, with the first and last vertices being the end-vertices,\nand a cycle (or circuit) is a path where there is an edge joining the first and last\nvertices. A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path that contains every vertex of\nthe graph exactly once, and a Hamiltonian cycle is a Hamiltonian path with an\nedge from the last vertex of the path to the first. Two paths are vertex-disjoint if\nneither has a vertex that appears on the other path except for possibly sharing 1 or\n2 end-vertices, and a set of paths in a graph are mutually vertex-disjoint if any two\ndistinct paths are vertex-disjoint. Hamiltonian cycles are useful in interconnec-\ntion networks as they can be used to easily undertake many-to-many broadcasts.\nAs regards sets of mutually vertex-disjoint paths, their existence has two bene-\nfits. A message can be split into pieces and mutually vertex-disjoint paths joining\ntwo distinct vertices u and v can be used to send each piece of the message in\nparallel from a processor at u to a processor at v, secure in the knowledge that\nthere will be no resulting conflict at interim vertices. Also, should processors\nor links fail, having alternative paths by which to communicate adds to the fault\ntolerance of the interconnection network. A multipath routing algorithm is often\nassociated with the mutually vertex-disjoint paths of an interconnection network,\nwhere a multipath routing algorithm is an algorithm implemented in an intercon-\n4\nnection network that finds mutually vertex-disjoint paths joining processors at any\ndistinct vertices in the network. A multipath routing algorithm is a source mul-\ntipath routing algorithm if the paths are fully computed at the source processor\nbefore messages are sent, and a multipath routing algorithm is deterministic if the\nalgorithm depends solely upon the vertices at which the source and destination\nprocessors are located.\nThe neighbourhood of a vertex v of a graph G = (V,E) is defined asNG(v) =\n{v\u2032 \u2208 V : (v, v\u2032) \u2208 E}. An articulation set for a graph G = (V,E) is a subset\nof vertices U \u2286 V so that if we remove every vertex of U from G, along with its\nincident edges, then the resulting graph has at least 2 connected components. A\ngraph G = (V,E) has connectivity \u03ba \u2265 1 if G has more than \u03ba vertices and there\nis a set of \u03ba vertices forming an articulation set but there exists no articulation\nset of size smaller than \u03ba. We repeatedly use Menger\u2019s Theorem: if a graph\nG = (V,E) has connectivity \u03ba then given any vertex v \u2208 V and any distinct\nvertices v1, v2, . . . , v\u03ba \u2208 V , different from v, there are \u03ba mutually vertex-disjoint\npaths from v to v1, v2, . . . , v\u03ba.\nThe length of a shortest path in a connected graph G = (V,E) between two\nvertices v, v\u2032 \u2208 V is denoted \u03b4G(v, v\u2032). The diameter of a graph G, denoted \u2206(G),\nis max{\u03b4G(v, v\u2032) : v, v\u2032 \u2208 V }. Suppose that |V | = n and let \u03ba \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n\u22121}.\nThe \u03ba-diameter of G, denoted \u2206\u03ba(G), is the smallest integer such that for every\npair of distinct vertices v and v\u2032 of V , there are \u03ba mutually vertex-disjoint paths\nfrom v to v\u2032 so that the longest such path has length at most \u2206\u03ba(G) (note that the\n\u03ba-diameter might be undefined). If \u03ba is equal to the connectivity of G then the\n\u03ba-diameter is known as the wide-diameter. The diameter of a graph G bounds the\nnumber of hops a message must undertake in a shortest-path routing algorithm\nover the interconnection network G. The \u03ba-diameter bounds the number of hops\na piece of a message must undertake when a message is partitioned and sent in\nparallel over \u03ba mutually vertex-disjoint paths. Note that Menger\u2019s Theorem tells\nus about the existence of mutually vertex-disjoint paths in a graph but nothing\nabout the lengths of such paths.\nA Cayley digraph G is defined as follows. Let \u0393 be a finite group with gener-\nating set {\u03b31, \u03b32, . . . , \u03b3r}. The elements of \u0393 form the vertex set of G and there is\na directed edge (\u03b3, \u03b3\u2032) in the graph G if \u03b3i\u03b3 = \u03b3\u2032, for some i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , r}. A\nCayley graph is a Cayley digraph where the associated generating set is closed un-\nder inverses (and so directed edges can be regarded as undirected edges). A graph\nG = (V,E) is vertex-transitive if given any two distinct vertices v, v\u2032 \u2208 V , there\nis an automorphism of G mapping v to v\u2032. Every Cayley graph is vertex-transitive.\nIf an interconnection network is vertex-transitive then it is feasible that a problem\n5\nmight be solved by a distributed algorithm so that every vertex executes the same\nprogram. If a vertex-transitive interconnection network is a Cayley graph then this\nopens the network to analysis using algebraic methods.\nThroughout, this paper, the graph G has vertex set V , where |V | \u2265 2, and edge\nset E. The set U = {0, 1}, and if u \u2208 U then u is the element of U different from\nu.\nDefinition 1 Let G = (V,E) be a graph where V contains at least 2 vertices.\nThe graph Bsw(G) is known as the biswapped graph with base G and is defined\nas follows:\n\u2022 Bsw(G) has vertex set {(u, v, w) : u \u2208 U, v, w \u2208 V }\n\u2022 Bsw(G) has edge set consisting of the cluster edges {((u, v, w), (u, v, w\u2032)) :\nu \u2208 U, v, w, w\u2032 \u2208 V, (w,w\u2032) \u2208 E} and the swap edges {((u, v, w),\n(u, w, v)) : u \u2208 U, v, w \u2208 V }.\nWe say that the vertices corresponding to some vertex u \u2208 U are the vertices\nof Bsw(G) whose first component is u, and that a vertex (u, v, w) of Bsw(G)\ncorresponding to u \u2208 U is indexed by v \u2208 V . Note that the vertices of Bsw(G)\ncorresponding to some vertex u \u2208 U and indexed by some v \u2208 V induce a copy of\nG. In what follows, we often wish to refer to a vertex in the copy of G correspond-\ning to u \u2208 U and indexed by v \u2208 V . For brevity, we henceforth refer to these\nvertices as Gvu. We often write a cluster edge of the form ((u, v, w), (u, v, w\u2032))\nas (u, v, w) \u2192c (u, v, w\n\u2032), and a swap edge of the form ((u, v, w), (u, w, v))\nis often written (u, v, w) \u2192s (u, w, v). A path of (possibly no) cluster edges\n(u, v, w)\u2192c . . .\u2192c (u, v, w\n\u2032) is often written as (u, v, w)\u2192\u2217c (u, v, w\u2032).\nThe vertices corresponding to the the elements 0 and 1 of U are depicted in\ntwo different ways in Fig. 1. In both depictions, the vertices of V are enumerated\nas v1, v2, . . . , vn. In the top depiction, the vertex (0, vi, vj), for example, lies on\nthe row corresponding to 0 \u2208 U , and within this row it is vertex vj of the cluster\nindexed by vi. In the bottom depiction, as regards the vertices corresponding to 1,\nthere is one row for the vertices indexed by each v \u2208 V , and the vertex (1, vi, vj),\nfor example, lies on the row indexed by vertex vi \u2208 V .\nIn [20], the lengths of shortest paths between arbitrary distinct vertices of\nBsw(G) were proven, with the corollary that Bsw(G) has diameter 2\u2206(G) + 2.\nA shortest-path routing algorithm was derived from these shortest-path results. A\ncomparative analysis was also undertaken on Bsw(Qn) and Q2n+1, where Qn is\nthe n-dimensional hypercube, given that these graphs have the same number of\n6\nvertices. This analysis showed that Bsw(Qn) has a number of advantages when\ncompared with Q2n+1 (in the context of interconnection networks).\n...\n...\n...\n...\n... ... ... ......\n... ... ... ......\nv1 vnv3v2 v1 vnv3v2 v1 vnv3v2 v1 vnv3v2\nv1 vnv3v2 v1 vnv3v2 v1 vnv3v2 v1 vnv3v2\nv1 vnv3v2\nv1 vnv3v2u = 0\ncopies of G\nvertex (1, v  ,  v  )2 1\nvertex (0, v  ,  v  )n 2\n... ... ... ......\nv1\nvn\nv2\nv1\nv3\nv2 v3 vn\nv1 vnv3v2 v1 vnv3v2 v1 vnv3v2 v1 vnv3v2\nv1 vnv3v2\n... ... ...\nv1 v2 v3 vn\nv1 v2 v3 vn\nv1 v2 v3 vn\ncopies of G\ncopies of G\nvertex (0, v  ,  v  )n 2\nvertex (1, v  ,  v  )2 1\nindex\nindex\nindex\nindex\nu = 0\nu = 1\nu = 1\nFigure 1. Some edges in Bsw(G).\n3 Hamiltonicity and Cayley graphs\nWe now show that if G is Hamiltonian then Bsw(G) is, and that if G is a Cayley\ngraph then Bsw(G) is.\nProposition 2 If G is Hamiltonian then Bsw(G) is Hamiltonian.\nProof Let v1, v2, . . . , vn be a Hamiltonian cycle in G. Let \u03c1i be the path in\nBsw(G) defined as:\n(0, vi, vi), (0, vi, vi\u22121), . . . , (0, vi, v1), (0, vi, vn),\n(0, vi, vn\u22121), (0, vi, vn\u22122), . . . , (0, vi, vi+1),\n7\nand let \u03c3i be the path in Bsw(G) defined as:\n(1, vi+1, vi), (1, vi+1, vi\u22121), . . . , (1, vi+1, v1),\n(1, vi+1, vn), (1, vi+1, vn\u22121), (1, vi+1, vn\u22122),\n. . . , (1, vi+1, vi+1).\nThe path obtained by concatenating these paths as:\n\u03c11, \u03c32, \u03c12, \u03c33, . . . , \u03c1n\u22121, \u03c3n, \u03c1n, \u03c31\nis actually a Hamiltonian cycle in Bsw(G).\nProposition 3 If G is a Cayley graph then Bsw(G) is a Cayley graph.\nProof Let \u0393 be a finite group with generating set \u03a3 so that G is the Cayley graph\nof (\u0393,\u03a3). Let \u03a0 be the symmetric group on 2 elements (that is, the cyclic group\nof order 2) generated by the element \u03c0; so, H is the Cayley graph of (\u03a0, {\u03c0}). We\ndenote the underlying set of any group by the name of the group too. Let \u03a0 act on\nthe set \u0393\u00d7 \u0393 via:\n(\u03b3, \u03b3\u2032)pi = (\u03b3\u2032, \u03b3) and (\u03b3, \u03b3\u2032)1\u03a0 = (\u03b3, \u03b3\u2032),\nwhere 1\u03a0 is the identity element of \u03a0. Define the set of elements \u0393\u00d7 \u0393 \u00d7 \u03a0 and\nits subset \u2126 = {(1G, \u03b3, 1H) : \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a3} \u222a {(1G, 1G, \u03c0)}, where 1G is the identity\nelement of \u0393. Define the following multiplication on elements of \u0393\u00d7 \u0393\u00d7 \u03a0:\n(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u01eb)(\u03b1\u2032, \u03b2 \u2032, \u01eb\u2032) =\n{\n(\u03b1\u03b2 \u2032, \u03b2\u03b1\u2032, \u01eb\u01eb\u2032) if \u01eb = \u03c0;\n(\u03b1\u03b1\u2032, \u03b2\u03b2 \u2032, \u01eb\u01eb\u2032) if \u01eb = 1\u03a0\n(where the \u2018internal\u2019 multiplications are those of the groups \u0393 and \u03a0). That is,\nwe have defined the group known as the wreath product \u0393 \u2240 \u03a0 (see, for example,\n[14]). It is trivial to verify that Bsw(G) is the Cayley graph of (\u0393 \u2240 \u03a0,\u2126) (with a\ndirected edge from a source vertex to a target vertex obtained by multiplying the\nsource vertex on the left by a generator of \u2126).\n4 Connectivity and disjoint paths\nIn this section, we examine aspects of the connectivity of Bsw(G) in relation to\nboth the connectivity and degree of G = (V,E).\n8\n4.1 In relation to the connectivity of G\nAs was implicitly observed in [20], Bsw(G) has connectivity at least \u03ba+ 1 when\nG has connectivity \u03ba \u2265 1. However, we refine this observation and explicitly\nconstruct for every distinct pair of vertices in Bsw(G), \u03ba + 1 mutually vertex-\ndisjoint paths between the 2 vertices, so obtaining an upper bound on the length\nof the longest of these paths; that is, an upper bound on D\u03ba+1(Bsw(G)), the\n(\u03ba + 1)-diameter of Bsw(G). We partition our constructions into a sequence of\npropositions depending upon the different types of pairs of vertices in Bsw(G).\nThe first proposition deals with the case when the vertices of Bsw(G) are of the\nform (u, v, w) and (u, v, w\u2032).\nProposition 4 Let G be a graph of connectivity \u03ba \u2265 1. Let (u, v, w) and (u, v, w\u2032)\nbe distinct vertices of Bsw(G). There are at least \u03ba + 1 mutually vertex-disjoint\npaths joining (u, v, w) and (u, v, w\u2032) so that the longest of these paths has length\nat most max{\u2206\u03ba(G),\u2206(G) + 6}.\nProof Clearly, we have \u03ba mutually vertex-disjoint paths, each of length at most\n\u2206\u03ba(G), joining the vertices (u, v, w) and (u, v, w\u2032) in Gvu. Let v\u2217 be a neighbour\nof v in G. Consider the following path \u03c1 in Bsw(G):\n(u, v, w)\u2192s (u, w, v)\u2192c (u, w, v\n\u2217)\n\u2192s (u, v\n\u2217, w)\u2192\u2217c (u, v\n\u2217, w\u2032)\u2192s (u, w\n\u2032, v\u2217)\n\u2192c (u, w\n\u2032, v)\u2192s (u, v, w\n\u2032),\nwhere the path in Gv\u2217u from (u, v\u2217, w) to (u, v\u2217, w\u2032) is any such path. This path \u03c1\nis vertex-disjoint with all of the \u03ba paths described earlier and has length at most\n\u2206(G) + 6.\nIn upcoming proofs, if we detail a path as in the proof of Proposition 4 in\nwhich there is a sub-path (u, v\u2217, w) \u2192\u2217c (u, v\u2217, w\u2032), for example, then unless we\nstate otherwise the implied path is any path in Gv\u2217u from the vertex (u, v\u2217, w) to\nthe vertex (u, v\u2217, w\u2032).\nThe next proposition deals with the case when pairs of vertices of Bsw(G) are\nof the form (u, v, w) and (u, v\u2032, w\u2032), where v 6= v\u2032.\nProposition 5 Let G be a graph of connectivity \u03ba \u2265 1, and let (u, v, w) and\n(u, v\u2032, w\u2032) be distinct vertices of Bsw(G) where v 6= v\u2032. There are at least \u03ba + 1\nmutually vertex-disjoint paths joining (u, v, w) and (u, v\u2032, w\u2032) so that the longest\nof these paths has length at most \u2206\u03ba(G) + \u2206(G) + 2.\n9\nProof We split the proof into two cases.\nCase 1: w 6= w\u2032.\nAs G has connectivity \u03ba, there are at least \u03ba mutually vertex-disjoint paths \u03c3\u20321, \u03c3\u20322,\n. . . , \u03c3\u2032\u03ba from vertex (u, v, w) to vertex (u, v, w\u2032) inGvu, so that each path has length\nat most \u2206\u03ba(G). For each i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , \u03ba}, if \u03c3\u2032i has length at least 2 then define\nwi as the penultimate vertex on \u03c3\u2032i (and so wi is a neighbour of w\u2032 in G). We may\nassume w.l.o.g. that if some \u03c3\u2032i has length 1 then i = 1.\nFor every i \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , \u03ba}, define the path \u03c3i in Bsw(G) as:\n(u, v, w)\u2192\u2217c (u, v, wi)\u2192s (u, wi, v)\u2192\n\u2217\nc (u, wi, v\n\u2032)\n\u2192s (u, v\n\u2032, wi)\u2192c (u, v\n\u2032, w\u2032),\nwhere the path in Gvu from (u, v, w) to (u, v, wi) is isomorphic to \u03c3\u2032i truncated\nat wi. Each path has length at most \u2206\u03ba(G) + \u2206(G) + 2. Define the path \u03c31 in\nBsw(G) as:\n(u, v, w)\u2192\u2217c (u, v, w\n\u2032)\u2192s (u, w\n\u2032, v)\u2192\u2217c (u, w\n\u2032, v\u2032)\n\u2192s (u, v\n\u2032, w\u2032),\nwhere the path in Gvu from (u, v, w) to (u, v, w\u2032) is isomorphic to \u03c3\u20321.

The result follows.\nWe can draw together Propositions 4, 5 and 6 as follows.\nTheorem 7 Let the graph G have connectivity \u03ba \u2265 1. There are \u03ba + 1 mutually\nvertex-disjoint paths joining any 2 distinct vertices ofBsw(G) such that the length\nof the longest of these paths is at most max{2\u2206(G) + 5,\u2206(G) + \u2206\u03ba(G) + 2};\nthat is, \u2206\u03ba+1(Bsw(G)) \u2264 max{2\u2206(G) + 5,\u2206(G) + \u2206\u03ba(G) + 2}.\nCorollary 8 Let G be a graph. If Bsw(G) has connectivity \u03ba + 1 then the wide-\ndiameter of Bsw(G) is bounded above by max{2\u2206(G)+5,\u2206(G)+\u2206\u03ba(G)+2}.\nHsu and \u0141uczak [9] proved that if a graph G is regular of degree \u03ba \u2265 2 and has\nconnectivity \u03ba then \u2206\u03ba(G) \u2265 \u2206(G)+ 1. Thus, we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 9 Let G be a graph. If G is regular of degree \u03ba \u2265 2 and has connec-\ntivity \u03ba then Bsw(G) has connectivity \u03ba+1 and the wide-diameter of Bsw(G) is\nbounded above by 2\u2206\u03ba(G) + 3.\nWe remark that many of the graphs G prevalent as interconnection networks are\nregular and have degree equal to their connectivity.\n4.2 In relation to the degree of G\nAs we now show, we can actually construct numerous paths joining 2 distinct\nvertices of Bsw(G) even when G has relatively low connectivity (though we need\nthat G is connected). Observe from the proof of Proposition 6 that we have not\nused the connectivity \u03ba of G; just that G is connected and that w and w\u2032 have\ndegree at least \u03ba in G. Consequently, the proof of Proposition 6 immediately\nyields the following result.\n14\nCorollary 10 Let G be a connected graph and let w and w\u2032 be vertices of G so\nthat w has degree at least dw and w\u2032 has degree at least dw\u2032 (it may be the case\nthat w = w\u2032). There are at least min{dw, dw\u2032} + 1 mutually vertex-disjoint paths\njoining (u, v, w) and (u, v\u2032, w\u2032) in Bsw(G) so that the length of the longest of\nthese paths is at most 2\u2206(G) + 5.\nWe can obtain analogues of Corollary 10 for Propositions 4 and 5.\nProposition 11 Let G be a connected graph and let w and w\u2032 be distinct vertices\nof G so that w has degree at least \u03b4w and w\u2032 has degree at least \u03b4w\u2032 . There are at\nleast min{\u03b4w, \u03b4w\u2032}+1 mutually vertex-disjoint paths joining the vertices (u, v, w)\nand (u, v, w\u2032) in Bsw(G) so that the length of the longest of these paths is at most\n3\u2206(G) + 6.\nProof Define d = min{\u03b4w, \u03b4w\u2032}. Let N be the set of vertices of V that are neigh-\nbours of both w and w\u2032 in G. For every vertex y \u2208 N , we have a path \u03c3y de-\nfined as (u, v, w) \u2192c (u, v, y) \u2192c (u, v, w\u2032) in Gvu. Suppose that |N | = m\u2032. If\n(w,w\u2032) is not an edge of G then define m = m\u2032, otherwise define m = m\u2032 + 1\nand the path \u03c3m as (u, v, w) \u2192c (u, v, w\u2032). Let wm+1, wm+2, . . . , wd be distinct\nneighbours of w in G none of which is in N , and let w\u2032m+1, w\u2032m+2, . . . , w\u2032d be dis-\ntinct neighbours of w\u2032 in G none of which is in N (in particular, the vertices of\n{wi, w\n\u2032\ni : i = m + 1, m + 2, . . . , d} are all distinct). Let xm+1, xm+2, . . . , xd, x\nbe distinct vertices of V such that each is different from v (such vertices trivially\nexist).\nFor each i \u2208 {m+ 1, m+ 2 . . . , d}, define the path \u03c3i in Bsw(G) as:\n(u, v, w)\u2192c (u, v, wi)\u2192s (u, wi, v)\u2192\n\u2217\nc (u, wi, xi)\n\u2192s (u, xi, wi)\u2192\n\u2217\nc (u, xi, w\n\u2032\ni)\u2192s (u, w\n\u2032\ni, xi)\n\u2192\u2217c (u, w\n\u2032\ni, v)\u2192s (u, v, w\n\u2032\ni)\u2192c (u, v, w\n\u2032).\nEach path \u03c3i has length at most 3\u2206(G) + 6. Define the path \u03c1 in Bsw(G) as:\n(u, v, w)\u2192s (u, w, v)\u2192\n\u2217\nc (u, w, x)\u2192s (u, x, w)\n\u2192\u2217c (u, x, w\n\u2032)\u2192s (u, w\n\u2032, x)\u2192\u2217c (u, w\n\u2032, v)\n\u2192s (u, v, w\n\u2032).\nThe path \u03c1 has length at most 3\u2206(G)+4. The paths \u03c1, \u03c31, \u03c32, . . . , \u03c3d are mutually\nvertex-disjoint and can be visualized as in Fig. 4.

Define d = min{\u03b4w, \u03b4w\u2032}. Let N = {w1, w2, . . . , wm\u2032}\nbe the set of vertices of V that are neighbours of both w and w\u2032 in G. If (w,w\u2032)\nis not an edge of G then define m = m\u2032, otherwise define m = m\u2032 + 1. Let\nwm+1, wm+2, . . . , wd be distinct neighbours of w in G none of which is in N , and\nlet w\u2032m+1, w\u2032m+2, . . . , w\u2032d be distinct neighbours of w\u2032 in G none of which is in N\n(in particular, the vertices of {wi, w\u2032i : i = m+ 1, m+ 2, . . . , d} are all distinct).\nSuppose that d\u2212m > 0 and so |V | \u2265 2+2(d\u2212m). Choose xm+1, xm+2, . . . ,\nxd, w\n\u2217 \u2208 V so that these vertices are all distinct and all different from v and v\u2032\n(this is possible). If d \u2212m = 0 then choose w\u2217 \u2208 V so that it is different from v\nand v\u2032 (recall, G does not consist of a solitary edge).\nFor each i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , m\u2032}, define the path \u03c3i in Bsw(G) as:\n(u, v, w)\u2192c (u, v, wi)\u2192s (u, wi, v)\u2192\n\u2217\nc (u, wi, v\n\u2032)\n\u2192s (u, v\n\u2032, wi)\u2192c (u, v\n\u2032, w\u2032).\nEach path \u03c3i has length \u2206(G) + 4. For each i \u2208 {m + 1, m + 2, . . . , d}, define\nthe path \u03c3i in Bsw(G) as:\n(u, v, w)\u2192c (u, v, wi)\u2192s (u, wi, v)\u2192\n\u2217\nc (u, wi, xi)\n16\n\u2192s (u, xi, wi)\u2192\n\u2217\nc (u, xi, w\n\u2032\ni)\u2192s (u, w\n\u2032\ni, xi)\n\u2192\u2217c (u, w\n\u2032\ni, v\n\u2032)\u2192s (u, v\n\u2032, w\u2032i)\u2192c (u, v\n\u2032, w\u2032).\nEach path \u03c3i has length at most 3\u2206(G) + 6.\nSuppose that the edge (w,w\u2032) does not appear in G. Define the path \u03c1 in\nBsw(G) as:\n(u, v, w)\u2192s (u, w, v)\u2192\n\u2217\nc (u, w, w\n\u2217)\u2192s (u, w\n\u2217, w)\n\u2192\u2217c (u, w\n\u2217, w\u2032)\u2192s (u, w\n\u2032, w\u2217)\u2192\u2217c (u, w\n\u2032, v\u2032)\n\u2192s (u, v\n\u2032, w\u2032).\nThe path \u03c1 has length at most 3\u2206(G) + 6.\nSuppose that the edge (w,w\u2032) is in G. Define the path \u03c3m in Bsw(G) as:\n(u, v, w)\u2192c (u, v, w\n\u2032)\u2192s (u, w\n\u2032, v)\u2192\u2217c (u, w\n\u2032, v\u2032)\n\u2192s (u, v\n\u2032, w\u2032),\nand define the path \u03c1 in Bsw(G) as:\n(u, v, w)\u2192s (u, w, v)\u2192\n\u2217\nc (u, w, v\n\u2032)\u2192s (u, v\n\u2032, w)\n\u2192c (u, v\n\u2032, w\u2032).\nThe paths \u03c3m and \u03c1 both have length at most \u2206(G) + 3.\nThe paths \u03c1, \u03c31, \u03c32, . . . , \u03c3d are mutually vertex-disjoint and can be visualized\nas in Fig. 5, where we assume that (w,w\u2032) is not an edge of G.\nWe can draw Propositions 10, 11 and 12 together in the following result.\nTheorem 13 Let G be a connected graph. Let (u, v, w) and (u\u2032, v\u2032, w\u2032) be any 2\ndistinct vertices of Bsw(G) so that \u03b4w and \u03b4w\u2032 are the degrees of w and w\u2032 in G,\nrespectively. There exist min{\u03b4w, \u03b4w\u2032} + 1 mutually vertex-disjoint paths joining\n(u, v, w) and (u\u2032, v\u2032, w\u2032) in Bsw(G) so that the length of the longest of these paths\nis at most 3\u2206(G) + 6.\nIt is worth mentioning the results in [1] as regards connectivity in OTIS net-\nworks in comparison with Theorem 13. In [1], it is proven that if G is a connected\ngraph such that every vertex has degree at least d then in OTIS-G there are at least\nd mutually vertex-disjoint paths joining any 2 distinct vertices so that the longest\nof these paths has length at most \u2206(G) + 4. This result assumes nothing about\n17\nthe connectivity of G, only its minimal degree. This is a powerful property of the\nOTIS construction, namely that one can use it to build highly connected graphs\nout of a base graph that does not necessarily have a high connectivity. This prop-\nerty is shared by biswapped networks in that Theorem 13 also often allows us\nto turn a graph G of low connectivity into a graph Bsw(G) of high connectivity\n(relatively speaking and in a uniform manner), yet retain some control over the\ndegree of Bsw(G).\n...\nw\nwm+1\nw'\ncopies of Gindex\n...\nv\nwd\n... ...\n...\nindex\nthe path \u03c1\nu = 0\nu = 1\nxdvertex (0, x   , w  )d d\n...\nw'd\nw'm+1\nw1 w'd\n...\nv'\n...\nw*\n...\nw\nwm+1\nw'\n...\nwd\n...\nw'd\nw'm+1\nwd\nw1\nw1\n...\nindex\nw w'\nw* w*\nv\nv'\nw w'\nv v'v\nwd w'd\nxd\nxd\nv'\n...\n...\n...\n...\nvertex (1, w  , v)1\nFigure 5.

The graph\nG has connectivity 1 yet, by Theorem 13, the graph Bsw(G) has connectivity\nm, with the degree of any vertex of Bsw(G) being only 1 greater than its corre-\nsponding degree in G (we also obtain control over the wide-diameter of Bsw(G)\ntoo). As another application of Theorem 13 relating to fault tolerance, suppose\nthat s and t are two vertices of some graph G where each has degree at least d and\nwhere there is a collection of \u03ba mutually vertex-disjoint paths in G joining s and\nt. Consider G as embedded within Bsw(G) where the intention is that Bsw(G)\nis to provide for extra tolerance of faults. If we have an interconnection network\nBsw(G) so that there are at least \u03ba faulty processors within the embedded copy\n18\nof G in Bsw(G) so that these faulty processors disconnect the processors at s and\nt (via the \u03ba paths) then so long as these faulty processors are not at neighbours\nof s and t, Theorem 13 ensures that within the interconnection network Bsw(G)\nthere will still be at least d mutually vertex-disjoint paths joining the processors at\ns and t. That is, \u2018wrapping\u2019 G within Bsw(G) can lead to added fault tolerance.\n4.3 Multipath routing algorithms\nFinally, let us comment as regards coverting the constructions of this section into\na multipath routing algorithm in an interconnection network (so we now, on occa-\nsion, talk of processors and links rather than vertices and edges). If one consults\nthe proofs of the various cases in the various results in this section then one can\neasily see that if G is an interconnection network whose underlying graph has\nconnectivity \u03ba and there is a deterministic multipath source routing algorithm RG\nto find \u03ba mutually vertex-disjoint paths in G from a processor at u to a processor\nat v, where u 6= v, then there is an analogous routing algorithm to find \u03ba + 1\nmutually vertex-disjoint paths in the interconnection network Bsw(G). There are\nonly one or two very minor comments to make. For example, we regularly com-\npute shortest paths in G and need to find (sets of) vertices with specific properties\n(such as being distinct from some other vertices or neighbours of some other ver-\ntex). These tasks can trivially be dealt with (if one assumes that our multipath\nsource routing algorithm RG can compute a shortest path joining 2 vertices in G,\nwhich is entirely reasonable). Consequently, because of the actual bounds on the\nlengths of the paths we compute, we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 14 Let G be an interconnection net-work whose underlying graph has\nconnectivity \u03ba and where there is a deterministic multipath source routing algo-\nrithm which computes \u03ba mutually vertex-disjoint paths joining any 2 distinct ver-\ntices in G so that this algorithm has time complexity polynomial in \u2206\u03ba(G), \u2206(G)\nand \u03ba. There is a deterministic multipath source routing algorithm in the inter-\nconnection network Bsw(G) that computes \u03ba + 1 mutually vertex-disjoint paths\njoining any 2 distinct vertices so that the length of the longest resulting path has\nlength at most max{2\u2206(G)+5,\u2206\u03ba(G)+\u2206(G)+2}. Moreover, this deterministic\nmultipath source routing algorithm for Bsw(G) has time complexity polynomial\nin \u2206\u03ba(G), \u2206(G) and \u03ba.\nAs an illustration of the application of Corollary 14, considerBsw(Qn). There\nis a well-known and simple deterministic multipath source routing algorithm for\n19\nthe hypercube Qn which is briefly described as follows (see [15]). W.l.o.g. we\nmay assume that our source vertex is (0, 0, . . . , 0) and that our destination vertex\nis (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 1, . . . , 1), where there is a prefix of i 0\u2019s. We obtain i paths by\nfirst routing to vertex (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 1, . . . , 1), where the edge used lies\nin dimension j, for each j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , i}, and then by using edges lying in di-\nmensions j+1, j+2, . . . , i, 1, 2, . . . , j\u22121. We obtain n\u2212 i paths by routing over\nthe edge in dimension j, for each j \u2208 {i+1, i+2, . . . , n}, and then by using edges\nin dimensions 1, 2, . . . , i before ending with the edge in dimension j. This yields\nn mutually vertex-disjoint paths, the longest of which has length n + 2. The un-\nderlying algorithm clearly runs in O(n2) time (note that n is both the connectivity\nand diameter of Qn). Consequently, Corollary 14 yields a deterministic multipath\nsource routing algorithm for Bsw(Qn) that runs in time polynomial in n.\n5 Conclusions\nLet us remark that biswapped networks should not necessarily be compared with\nother interconnection networks on a like-for-like basis, as the whole point of\nbiswapped networks is that they can be laid out (in the plane) so as to be easily im-\nplementable as optical transpose interconnection systems (see the first visualiation\nin Fig. 1). For example, one might argue that if Qn is an n-dimensional hypercube\nthen Bsw(Qn) has 22n+1 vertices, connectivity n + 1 and wide-diameter 2n + 5\n(from Corollary 9), whereas Q2n+1 has 22n+1 vertices, connectivity 2n + 1, and\nwide-diameter 2n+2 [13]; consequently,Q2n+1 should be preferable toBsw(Qn).\nHowever, the crucial point is that it is by no means obvious as to how to efficiently\nimplement Q2n+1 as an optical transpose interconnection system (assuming that\nQn has a suitable electronic implementation). The obvious implementation, where\nQ2n+1 is considered as 2n+1 copies of Qn with these copies inter-connected in the\n\u2018shape\u2019 of Qn+1, does not have any simple planar depiction and would be such\nas to result in n22n+1 optical connections compared with only 22n optical connec-\ntions in Bsw(Qn). Also, and importantly, Bsw(G) can easily be laid out (in the\nplane), and Q2n+1 involves (2n+ 1)22n+1 edges whereas Bsw(Qn) only involves\nn22n+1 + 22n edges. However, the demands of optical transpose interconnec-\ntion systems in comparison to standard interconnection networks, along with their\ncomparative benefits, have been well documented elsewhere and so we do not feel\nthe need to justify them further.\nWe have shown that the general construction of a biswapped networkBsw(G)\nfrom a graph G has a number of beneficial properties in the context of parallel\n20\ncomputing. Whilst our work provides a precise analysis of aspects of connectivity,\nthere are other obvious directions in which it can be extended. We have obtained\nupper bounds on the (\u03ba + 1)-diameter of Bsw(G) in terms of \u2206\u03ba(G) and \u2206(G).\nIt would be interesting to obtain lower bounds and to seek to improve our upper\nbounds. The fault diameter of a graph G of connectivity \u03ba is the maximal diame-\nter of any graph resulting from G after the removal of at most \u03ba\u2212 1 vertices (and\ntheir incident edges). It is often closely related to the wide-diameter (especially\nin graphs prevalent as interconnection networks). Determining upper bounds on\nthe fault diameter of Bsw(G), in terms of parameters relating to G, would be a\nsensible undertaking. Also, from a combinatorial perspective the construction of\nBsw(G) from G is a natural construction (as is witnessed by its elegant charac-\nterization using the wreath product from group theory). Can this construction be\ngeneralised so that instead of being built around the set U of 2 elements, it is built\naround a graph H with vertex set U and edge set F ? We intend to study gen-\neralisations such as this in future. Finally, it would be interesting to empirically\nevaluate algorithms designed for hybrid optical networks such as OTIS networks\nand biswapped networks (such an empirical evaluation would have to take account\nof the hybrid nature of such networks).\nReferences\n[1] W.
