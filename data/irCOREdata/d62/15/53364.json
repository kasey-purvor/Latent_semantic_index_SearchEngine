INTRODUCTION \n \nMultiwavelets have been proposed as a generalization \nof the traditional scalar wavelet, with multiresolution \nanalysis of multiplicity r . It has been proposed that \nmultiwavelet bases should be better than wavelet bases \nfor wavelet applications [1]. It is because there are \nlimitations for the single wavelet decomposition. First \nof all, it cannot offer simultaneous orthogonality, \nsymmetry and compact support together with higher \nregularity (or approximation order greater than one) \n[2]. Among the single wavelets only the Haar wavelet \nfulfils the above properties, but it is discontinuous in \nthe spatial domain. Multiwavelet systems based on two \nscaling functions and two wavelet functions allow these \nproperties simultaneously. Therefore, the design of \nmultiwavelet filters is more flexible. \nMultiwavelet transform has been applied to \ncompression and denoising applications in the past few \nyears. Experimental results [3-6] have shown that \nmultiwavelets generally outperform single wavelets in \ndenoising using thresholding. It is well known that the \nsuccess of multiwavelets in denoising applications often \ndepends on shorter supports and higher vanishing \nmoments of the multifilters. The number of high \namplitude wavelet coefficients created by a brutal \ntransition like an edge is proportional to the width of \nthe supports of the filters. For a more accurate \nlocalization of singularities, the number of high \namplitude wavelet coefficients produced should be as \nsmall as possible. So the supports of the filters should \nbe as short as possible. Moreover, the more the \nvanishing moments, the smaller the coefficients can be \nproduced over smooth regions at fine scales. Therefore, \nthe multiwavelet coefficients that belong to the noise \ncomponent can be more easily distinguished at fine \nscales. The support size increases proportionally to the \nnumber of vanishing moments, and multiwavelets can \nprovide a better trade-off of this. \nAs a result, we extend the denoising algorithm using \nsingularity detection from single wavelet transform to \nmultiwavelet transform. We perform the magnitude \nsums over the \u2018cone of influence\u2019 and estimate the \nregularity from their interscale ratios. It is because this \nwas proven to be a better approach to detect singularity \nin the single wavelet transform [7,8]. Intuitively, the \nshorter filter supports lead to a shorter \u2018cone of \ninfluence\u2019 and better frequency localization. We also \ninvestigate the interscale difference, which is \ncomplementary to the interscale ratio. Compared to the \nsingle wavelet case [7,8], improved results for \nsingularity detection can be achieved, and this is \nillustrated in the signal denoising results in this paper. \nThe organization of this paper is as the following. First \nof all, we review the preprocessing and the construction \nof discrete multiwavelet transform. We then have an \nunderstanding of estimating Lipschitz regularity by the \nmultiwavelet transform with preprocessing. We \ndetermine the \u2018cone of influence\u2019 and the magnitude \nsum of the undecimated discrete multiwavelet \ntransform coefficients. Next we describe the denoising \nalgorithm using the multiwavelet singularity detection \ntechnique, which is based on thresholding of the \nmultiwavelet coefficients according to their interscale \nratio and difference. Finally we present the results and \nconclusion. \n \n2. PREPROCESSING \n \nPreprocessing (or prefiltering) is usually performed \nbefore the multiwavelet decomposition. Prefiltering \ndoes not exist in the single wavelet transform. It can be \nthought of as the vectorization of an input signal to \nproduce a certain discrete-time vector-valued signal for \nthe discrete vector-valued wavelet transform. After the \nmultiwavelet reconstruction, postfiltering is applied to \ngive a one-stream recovered signal. Prefiltering often \nproduce correlated coefficients which contain \ninformation of the regularity of the input signal. \nMultifiltering captures this information and further \ncharacterizes it with its vector-valued transform. \nFor the singularity detection in the signal denoising \napplication, we experimented two sets of prefilters, the \nXia\u2019s prefilter [9] and Plonka\u2019s prefilter [10]. These \nprefilters are designed with the constraint that their \ncombination with the multiscaling and multiwavelet \nfilters will have lowpass and highpass properties. Xia\u2019s \nprefilter is orthogonal which is energy preserving, but it \nis first order only. Plonka\u2019s prefilter is symmetric and \nsecond order. It is synthesized with perfect \nreconstruction filters having linear phase. The prefilter \ncoefficient matrices are shown in the Appendix. \n \n3.

GHM \nmultifilters have many nice properties. The translates of \nthe multiscaling and multiwavelet functions are \northogonal. The multiscaling and multiwavelet \nfunctions are quite smooth and they have enough \nvanishing moments to produce small transform \ncoefficients at fine scales. The scaling functions have \nshort support [0,1] and [0,2] while [0,3] is expected for \nscalar case with scaling function satisfying a two-scale \nequation with 4 coefficient matrices. They are also of \nsecond order approximation, which can represent \nconstant and linear functions by a linear combination of \ntheir translates. They are smoother and have slightly \nshorter supports than CL multifilters [12]. The \nmultifilter coefficient matrices are shown in the \nAppendix. \n \n4. ESTIMATION OF LIPSCHITZ REGULARITY \n \nFrom [13], wavelet methods for measuring Lipschitz \nregularity was introduced. Regularity is measured by \nlooking at the asymptotic decays of wavelet transform \ncoefficients instead of Fourier transform coefficients. \nThis is possible because wavelets can simultaneously \nlocalize signals in time and frequency. The property of \nlocalization in time enables us to estimate local \nregularity, whereas the localization in frequency \nenables the measurement. \nMultiwavelets are generated by several scaling \nfunctions. Preprocessing is necessary when applying \ndiscrete multiwavelet filterbank to scalar signals. The \ncombined filter responses may not provide localization \nin frequency domain. It can be shown that with an \nappropiate designed prefilter and postfilter, one can \nestimate the Lipschitz regularity from multiwavelet \ncoefficients. \nMultiwavelet Transform Magnitude Sum \nThere are many disadvantages of estimating the local \nLipschitz exponents of a signal by tracing the evolution \nof its wavelet transform modulus maxima [7,8]. \nTherefore, for the multiwavelets case, we estimate the \nLipschitz regularity from the interscale evolution of the \nmagnitude sum over the \u2018cone of influence\u2019. We then \nperform signal denoising by thresholding the \nmultiwavelet coefficients according to the interscale \nratios and differences of the magnitude sums. The \n\u2018cone of influence\u2019 and the magnitude sum for the \nmultiwavelet transform are determined as the \nfollowing. \nCone of Influence (COI) \nThe COI represents the support length of the wavelet \nfilter. The support length is different at different scales. \nLet the support of l\uf079  be \uf05b \uf05dll KK ,\uf02d  for l =1, 2. The \nCOI of v in the scale-space plane, \uf028 \uf029jvlCOI , , is the set of \nindex pairs \uf028 \uf029jn \uf02d2,  such that n is included in the \nsupport of l\uf079 . Since the support of l\uf079  is equal to \nj\nl\nj Kvn \uf02d\uf02d \uf03c\uf02d 22 , the COI is determined as \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07djljjjvl KvnnCOI \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf0a3\uf02d\uf03d 22:2,, . \nThe COI of v consists of the scale-space points \uf028 \uf029jn \uf02d2,  \nfor which the support of l\uf079  intersects at n = v. If n is \ninside the COI of v then \uf028 \uf029jnld ,  depends on the value of \nf  in the neighborhood of v. Since l\nj Kvn \uf03c\uf02d \uf02d2 , the \npointwise Lipschitz condition is identical to the \nuniform Lipschitz condition. \nMagnitude Sum over the COI \nLet \uf028 \uf029jvlN ,  be the WTMS at v over the COI of v. We have \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf0e5\n\uf0ce\n\uf03d\nj\nvlCOInl\nj\nnl\nj\nvl dfN\n,,\n,,\n. \nThen from the interscale ratio of the magnitude sum, \nwe can characterize and estimate the Lipschitz \nregularity of a signal. \n \n5. DENOISING ALGORITHM \n \nThe denoising algorithm is simple and easy to be \nimplemented. The basic procedures are listed as the \nfollowing: \n1. Perform the discrete multiwavelet transform (5 levels \nof decomposition) after prefiltering the noisy test \nsignal. \n2. Determine the COI for all scales and compute the \nmagnitude sum of the transformed coefficients over \nthe COI for all positions. \n3. Compute the interscale ratio of the magnitude sum at \neach position. Retain those multiwavelet coefficients \nwith interscale ratios higher than 2. \n4. Reconstruct the signal from the selected multiwavelet \ncoefficients using the inverse discrete multiwavelet \ntransform and postfiltering. \nHere are some remarks for the denoising algorithm: \n1. As it is observed by the authors in [8] that WTMS of \nsome small irregular signals with Lipschitz \nexponents between 1\uf02d  and 0  will also increase as \nthe scale increases. This enables them to falsely \nfulfill the interscale ratio thresholding criterion. So \nthe interscale difference thresholding criterion was \nalso employed. \n2. Two approaches of retaining coefficients were \nexperimented (step 3). They are (i) retaining the \ncoefficients within the COI; (ii) retaining only the \ncoefficients at the positions in the COI which are \ndetermined by the maxima of the wavelet transform \nof an impulse. \n3. The suitable threshold values for the interscale ratio \nis 2  and for the interscale difference is 1.0  for \nretaining the coefficients within the COI. While they \nare 2  and 01.0  respectively for retaining the \nimpulse maximal coefficients in the COI. \n4. Both of the approaches use a joint selection, that is to \nconsider the magnitude sum of the square sum of the \nmagnitude of the two coefficient components. \n \n6. RESULTS \n \nAs a preliminary work, we experimented the above \ndenoising algorithm with a length-256 1-d noisy signal \nusing the Xia\u2019s prefilter and the GHM multifilters. The \noriginal signal contains various features such as steps, \nregular slopes, steep slopes and irregular structures. \nWhite Gaussian noise with noise variance equal to 0.1 \nis added to the original signal to produce a noisy signal \nwith MSE equal to 0.0085 (Figure 1(a)). 30.63% \nreduction in MSE was obtained (the MSE decreases \nfrom 0.007387 to 0.005124) by the previous denoising \nalgorithm using the single wavelet singularity detection \n[7]. In our experiment, 34.1% reduction in MSE is \nobtained (the MSE decreases from 0.0085 to 0.0056) by \nthe denoising algorithm using the multiwavelet \nsingularity detection. The reconstructed denoised signal \nis shown in Figure 1(b). \nWe also experimented the same original signal \ncorrupted by the white Gaussian noise with noise \nvariance equal to 0.05 and impulsive noise to produce a \nnoisy signal with a MSE equal to 0.0343 (Figure 2(a)). \nWe used the Plonka\u2019s prefilter and the GHM \nmultifilters for the multiwavelet decomposition. \n77.96% reduction in MSE was obtained (the MSE \ndecreases from 0.036909 to 0.008133) by the previous \ndenoising algorithm using the single wavelet \nsingularity detection [8]. In our experiment, 81.04% \nreduction in MSE is obtained (the MSE decreases from \n0.0343 to 0.0065) by the denoising algorithm using the \nmultiwavelet singularity detection. The reconstructed \ndenoised signal is shown in Figure 2(b). \nWe found that retaining those coefficients within the \nCOI is particularly effective for denoising the white \nGaussian noise, while retaining those maxima \ncoefficients (remark 2) in the COI is particularly \neffective for denoising the white Gaussian noise and \nimpulsive noise. Moreover, it was found that \nperforming selection in a joint manner (remark 4) is \nbetter than in an individual manner. \n \n7. CONCLUSION \n \nIn this paper, we extended the singularity detection \nfrom the single wavelet transform to the multiwavelet \ntransform. We developed the multiwavelet singularity \ndetection and illustrated it with the signal denoising \nresults. From the preliminary denoising results of a 1-d \nwhite Gaussian noise and impulsive noise corrupted \nsignals, we verified the advantageous properties of the \nmultiwavelet transform over the single wavelet \ntransform for singularity detection. We account that the \nshorter supports of the multifilters contribute to the \nimprovement of the singularity detection, as the size of \nthe \u2018cone of influence\u2019 becomes smaller and so the \noverlappings of the non-isolated transformed \nsingularities become less. The vanishing moments of \nthe multifilters are also enough to have better signal \napproximation, and a higher extent of noise attenuation \nupon thresholding can be obtained. We conclude that \nsignal denoising using the multiwavelet singularity \ndetection technique is better than using the single \nwavelet singularity detection one. \n \nAPPENDIX \n \nXia\u2019s prefilter: \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\uf02d\n\uf03d\n2323\n216216\n0Q\n \nPlonka\u2019s prefilter and postfilter: \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d\n033\n6666\n0Q\n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n221\n10\n0P\n \nGHM multifilters: \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\n203402\n522103\n0H\n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d\n214029\n0103\n1H  \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n2034029\n00\n2H\n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n0402\n00\n3H\n \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf03d\n2023201\n203402\n0G\n \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\n\uf03d\n0209\n214029\n1G\n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n2023209\n2034029\n2G\n \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf02d\n\uf03d\n0201\n0402\n3G\n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a \nresearch grant (project number G-YD26) from the \nHong Kong Polytechnic University, and by the Centre \nfor Multimedia Signal Processing, The Hong Kong \nPolytechnic University. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n [1] G.
