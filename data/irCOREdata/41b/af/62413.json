In the dual \nporosity, dual permeability aquifers such as the Chalk aquifer, movement of pesticides and \ntheir metabolites through the unsaturated zone to groundwater is generally considered to be \nthrough one of two pathways; a rapid by-pass flow and a slower \u2018piston-flow\u2019 route via the \nrock matrix. However, the dissolved form or \u2018colloidal species\u2019 in which pesticides move \nwithin the water body is poorly understood. Following heavy rainfall, very high peaks in \npesticide concentration have been observed in shallow Chalk aquifers. These concentrations \nmight be well explained by colloidal transport of pesticides. We have sampled a Chalk \ngroundwater beneath a deep (30 m) unsaturated zone known to be contaminated with the \npesticide diuron. Using a tangential flow filtration technique we have produced colloidal \nfractions from 0.45\u00b5m to 1kDa. In addition, we have applied agricultural grade diuron to a \ntypical chalk soil and created a soil water suspension which was also subsequently \nfractionated using the same filtration system. The deep groundwater sample showed no \nevidence of association between colloidal material and pesticide concentration. In \ncomparison, despite some evidence of particle trapping or sorption to the filters, the soil water \nclearly showed an association between the <0.45\u00b5m and <0.1\u00b5m colloidal fractions which \ndisplayed significantly higher pesticide concentrations than the unfiltered sample. \nDegradation products were also observed and found to behave in a similar manner to the \nparent compound. Although relatively large colloids can be generated in the Chalk soil zone, \n  2\nit appears transport to depth in a colloidal-bound form does not occur. Comparison with other \nfield and monitoring studies suggests that rapid by-pass flow is unlikely to occur beneath 4-\n5 m. Therefore, shallow groundwaters are most at risk from rapid transport of high \nconcentrations of pesticide-colloidal complexes. The presence of a deep unsaturated zone will \nmean that most of the colloidal-complexes will be filtered by the narrow chalk pores and the \nmajority of pesticide transport will occur in a \u2018dissolved\u2019 form through the more gradual \n\u2018piston-flow\u2019 route. \n \nIntroduction \n \nAgrochemical contamination of groundwater has been identified as an increasing problem in \nEurope (Skark and Zullei-Seibert, 1995) and the UK (Environment Agency, 2002). Recently \nthe occurrence of both pesticides and their metabolites within groundwater have been \nidentified (Kolpin et al., 1996, 2004; Gooddy et al., 2002, 2005; Johnson et al., 2001; Postle et \nal., 2004). Pesticides in groundwater have been found to originate from arable land (e.g. \nGooddy et al., 2001) as well as a number of non-agricultural sources, such as landfills \n(Harrison et al., 1998), railway lines (Schweinsberg et al., 1999) and amenity use (Lapworth \nand Gooddy, 2006). A recent study looking into the impact of climate on pesticide behaviour \nin the environment (Bloomfield et al., 2006) has suggested the types of pesticide and rates of \napplication are likely to be altered to reflect significantly modified rainfall seasonality and \nintensity as well as increased temperatures resulting in likely changes in land-use. Therefore a \nprocess based understanding of pesticide transport must be seen as a priority in the protection \nand maintenance of potable water resources  \n \nAlong with the dynamic of water flow, pesticide transport from the soil surface to \ngroundwater is controlled by several process including plant uptake, sorption to solid phases, \nmicrobially mediated degradation and \u2018dissolved\u2019 and colloidal phase migration (Foster et al., \n1991; Chilton et al., 2005). Colloids have been operationally defined as particles with \ndiameters less than 10-5 m (10 \uf06dm) (Stumm, 1977). Colloids are often generated in the soil \nsystem by dispersion from soil aggregates in response to rainfall and infiltration (Ryan and \nElimelech, 1996). Colloids in the subsurface can significantly enhance the mobility and \ntransport of contaminants (McCarthy and Zachara, 1989) especially those that are \ncomparatively insoluble (Grolimund et al., 1996). Studies suggest that colloids are able to \nmove through porous media even when the degree of saturation is very low (Harvey and \n  3\nGarabedian, 1991; Wan and Tokunaga, 1997). Numerous studies have been undertaken that \nshow pesticide can sorb to colloids and potentially enhance their transport (e.g. Vinten et al., \n1983; Worrall et al., 1999; Seta and Karathanasis, 1997; Kulikova and Perminova, 2002).  \n \nThe Chalk, the major UK aquifer, is a soft microporous and fractured calcium carbonate \naquifer with dual porosity and dual permeability. It is an extremely important resource \nproviding 15% of the water supply nationally and up to 35% regionally in the south and east \nof England and is under increasing stress from increased rates of abstraction and from \ncontaminant sources. Flow through the Chalk unsaturated zone is often believed to be by a \ncombination of two main mechanisms; intergranular seepage through the matrix, sometimes \ntermed \u2018piston flow\u2019 (e.g. Price et al 1976; Price, 1993); and rapid movement through \nfractures (e.g. Headworth, 1972), often referred to as \u2018preferential flow\u2019. The Chalk matrix is \na very fine grained porous media with median pore-throat sizes of the order of 0.1\u00b5m (Price, \n1976). This is narrow and provides a degree of natural filtration of an infiltrating recharge \nwater. Indeed, colloidal particles larger than 0.1\u00b5m are unlikely to pass through the matrix \nand might therefore be more likely to penentrate the chalk through a preferential flow path. \n \nShand and Bloomfield (1995) found evidence for the transport of soil particles down to 3m \nalong fracture surfaces in the chalk. Iron-rich clays were found to be prominent at shallow \ndepths. In a study by Gooddy et al. (2001), high concentrations of the herbicide isoproturon \nwere found in shallow chalk groundwater (3-5 m) by using a static sampler system that \ncollected recent recharge water arriving at the water table. As concentrations of isoproturon \nincreased there was no concomitant rise in nitrate. Although no direct field measurements \nwere made, the workers hypothesized that the isoproturon had moved through the soil and \nunsaturated zone by a preferential flow route sorbed to soil colloids. A related study by \nJohnson et al. (2001) found even more compelling evidence for colloidal transport of \npesticides. In this study high concentrations of the herbicide isoproturon were found in \npumped shallow Chalk groundwater following intensive rainfall events for three successive \nyears after the herbicide was last applied. Both of these herbicide studies strongly suggested a \ncolloidal source of pesticides in the shallow groundwater as concentrations of non-sorbing \nsolutes such as agriculturally derived nitrate and chloride did not show the same relationship \nwith rainfall intensity and soil particles acted as a long term source of the contaminant.  \n \n \n  4\nSuspended colloidal material can be separated from the dissolved aqueous fraction principally \nin two ways, filtration and centrifugation. Conventional filtration methods such as \noperationally defined 0.45\u00b5m filters have been used for countless environmental studies to \nseparate the \u2018dissolved\u2019 and solid fractions, however colloidal particles span a wide range of \npore sizes and are therefore difficult to study using these methods. Ultrafiltration (using high \npressure) has been used to fractionate samples, but this method is plagued with the problem of \nconcentration polarisation effects and membrane clogging due to colloid aggregation on the \nsurface of the membrane (Heathwaite et al., 2005). The use of  Tangential Flow Fractionation \n(TFF, also called cross-flow filtration) has been investigated as a better method for \nfractionation as the tangential arrangement minimises the clogging at membrane surfaces \n(Morrison and Benoit, 2004). Although this is an improvement on classical methods of \nfiltration it does not avoid coagulation altogether. Most systems also generally require a \nrelatively large sample volume (i.e. >100 mL) which can be a constraint to some experimental \nprocedures. \n \nTangential-Flow Fractionation has grown in popularity as the fractionation technique to use in \nthe field of water research. Li et al. (2004) characterised humic acids which had previously \nbeen fractionated by TFF. Gu\u00e9guen et al. (2002) have used this technique to demonstrated \nthat TFF can produce reliable fractionations of natural organic colloids in aquatic systems. \nOlivie-Lauquet et al. (2000) have used TFF to characterise groundwaters and surface waters \nfor both organic and inorganic colloidal material. Other workers have also recently \ndemonstrated this technique to be effective in groundwater systems (Hassell\u00f6v et al., 2007).  \n \nIn this study we have used tangential flow filtration to fractionate natural colloidal material \nfrom soil and groundwater. We have examined the colloid-pesticide association in calcareous \nsoil suspensions where the pre-emergent herbicide, diuron (3,4-dichlorophenyldimethylurea), \nhas been recently applied, and in a sample of relatively deep chalk groundwater known to be \ncontaminated with diuron. The objectives of this study are to determine whether pesticides \n(and their degradation products) can form stable complexes with colloidal material present in \nthe soil zone, and if these complexes also exist in groundwater beneath a relatively deep \nunsaturated zone. By considering our findings in relation to recently published field studies \n(Haria et al., 2003; Ireson et al., 2006) and modelling investigations (Mathias et al., 2005; \nMathias et al., 2006), we present two conceptual models for pesticide movement from the \npoint of agricultural application to the groundwater beneath. \n  5\n \n \nMaterials and Methods \n \nSoil Sampling \nChalk soil samples (roughly 50 kg) from southern England were taken from the top 15cm of \nan agricultural soil profile using an auger. Root material and any residual crop from within the \nroot zone (approximately the top 5cm) was discarded, as was any gravel-sized material. The \nsoil was homogenised and a subsample of 20 kg spread out over area of 1m2, with an \napproximate depth of 1cm. 1000mg of Karmax TM (Dupont agricultural grade diuron) with a \n83% diuron content was dispersed in 2000mL of ultra-pure water and irrigated evenly over \nthe soil sample and left to soak into the soil for two hours. This gave an equivalent loading of \n6.7 kg\/ha, the same as previously used in a field based degradation trial by Gooddy et al \n(2002). Duplicate soil suspensions with solid solution ratios of 1:5 were prepared using 2.4kg \nof the irrigated soil (equivalent to 41.5mg diuron) and 12L of ultrapure water. The mixtures \nwere agitated for 30 minutes and then allowed to settle. One sample was allowed to settle for \n10 hours prior to decanting 10L of the supernatant into brown glass bottles. The suspensions \nwere stored in the dark at approximately 20\u00baC to allow microbial degradation of the diuron to \ntake place. The other sample was agitated periodically, settled and decanted after 63 days. \nThe decanted samples were stored at 3\u00baC prior to analysis and fractionation using tangential \nflow fractionation. \n \nGroundwater Sampling \nA site in southeast England where a previous diuron contamination had been reported \n(Lapworth and Gooddy, 2006: site 14) was chosen for the groundwater sample. The borehole \nsampled is cased down to approximately 10 m with the water table at 31 m at the time of \nsampling. The total depth of the borehole is 36 m. The borehole was purged prior to sampling \nto obtain a fresh raw groundwater sample. The sample was taken directly from a stainless \nsteel sampling tap on the rising-main of the borehole. Appropriate protocols were followed to \nminimise the risk of artificially creating or mobilising colloids during sampling (Backhus et \nal., 1993). Two sterile 50L stainless steel sample containers, (Ucon Containersysteme AG, \nGermany) with stainless steel plugs and PTFE seals, were used to collect and store the \ngroundwater. The samples were placed in a cold store and stored in the dark at 3\u00baC within \n3hours of taking the sample to minimise microbiological activity.  \n  6\n \nTangential Flow Filtration \nFor any given tangential flow system two fractions are usually generated. The \u2018permeate\u2019 \nfraction is that which passes through the TFF membrane, whereas the \u201cretentate\u201d is that which \nis retained by the ultrafiltration membrane. The latter is enriched with colloids, which have \nnot passed through the membrane. To concentrate colloidal material, water from the sample \nreservoir is pumped across the ultrafiltration membrane from where the permeate is isolated \nin a separate reservoir whilst the retentate is recycled back into the sample reservoir. The \nconcentration of colloids increases with time. A schematic diagram of the system is shown in \nFigure 1. \n \nTangential flow filtration was carried out on all samples by using a Pelicon 2 ultrafiltration \nunit (Millipore, UK). The whole system comprises a peristaltic pump, an acrylic holder and \nan ultrafiltration cassette. Six cassettes were used in series and in decreasing size. For the \nsmaller sizes the filter cassettes are differentiated in terms of kiloDaltons (kDa) since \nfractionation at this scale is carried out on a molecular mass basis. The cassettes used were \n0.45\u00b5m, 0.1\u00b5m, 1000 kDa, 100 kDa, 10 kDa and 1k Da respectively.  These are all made of  \nregenerated cellulose and have a surface areas of 0.50m2. Cleaning of the filters was carried \nout in accordance with the procedure used by Gu\u00e9guen at al. (2002).  \n \nFor the chalk\/soil suspension samples a flow rate of 37 mL\/min for the permeate was \nmaintained. This flow rate allowed for reasonable sample processing times without generating \nexcessively high pressures which might cause tubing to malfunction or split. Permeate \nvolumes for these samples started at about 5L for the 0.45\u00b5m filter. For the groundwater \nsample due to the lower colloidal content the permeate flow rate was increased to 50 mL\/min \nand a larger initial permeate volume of 75 L was used. Generally the processing of 5L took \nbetween 2-2\u00bd  hours. \n \nDiuron and Metabolite Analysis \nAnalysis of diuron and its principal metabolites was accomplished by reversed-phase HPLC \nseparation employing isocratic elution in conjunction with UV detection of the separated \ncomponents. The method used is similar to that previously published by Field et al. (1997) \nand as modified in Gooddy et al. (2002) . For the soil suspension samples the limit of  \n  7\ndetection was ca. 0.002 mg\/L. For the groundwater samples it was necessary to initially pre-\nconcentrate the samples by C18 SPE cartridges (Waters Oasis HLB 60mg). Against standard \nsolutions for phenylureas this process gave a 96% recovery for diuron, 93% for primary \ndegradation product dichlorophenylmethyl urea (DCPMU), 96% for the secondary \ndegradation product dichorophenyl urea (DCPU) and 83% for the tertiary degradation \ndichloroanaline (DCA). The limit of detection was ca. 0.005 \u00b5g\/L. \n \nResults  \nSoil Pesticide-Colloid complexes \n \nPesticide analysis of the raw soil water suspension and subsequent fractions obtained by \ntangential flow filtration from the initial sample (i.e. 12 hours after application) are shown in \nFigure 2. Data is shown for both the parent compound and any degradation products found. \nThe tangential flow fractions are shown in two parts; the retentate, corresponding to material \nwhich would not pass through a filter of this size, and the permeate, which corresponds to \nmaterial which is small enough to get through the filtration mesh. In all cases the \nconcentration in the retentate exceeds that of the permeate, but it is only in the case of the \n>0.45\u00b5m and >0.1\u00b5m retentate fractions that the concentration exceeds that found in the \nunfiltered water. \n \nThe distribution of the relative fractions and the resulting pesticide and metabolite \nconcentrations observed after 63 days are shown in Figure 3. Of note is the appearance of two \nadditional degradation products, DCPU and DCA. However, compared with previous soil \ndegradation studies carried out by Gooddy et al (2002), the concentrations of the degradation \nproducts relative to the parent compound are low. In a similar manner to the original sample, \nconcentrations of diuron only exceed the unfiltered water concentration in the >0.45\u00b5m and \n>0.1\u00b5m fractions of the retentate. The same is also true for DCPMU, whereas the retentate \nconcentration of DCPU only exceeds the unfiltered water concentration in the 0.45\u00b5m \nfraction. This may reflect the limits of detection of the method rather than indicate anything \nmore significant about the degree of pesticide binding. The same is likely to be true of the \nDCA pesticide data. It is interesting to note that the ratios between the retentate and the \npermeate are remarkably similar between the two samples which gives a significant degree of \ncredibility to the method used (see tables 1 and 2). \n \n  8\nTables 1 and 2 show the mass balance through the filtration experiment, by multiplying the \ndetected concentration of diuron by the volume of water in either the permeate or retentate \n(the degradation products have been omitted from this calculation since the contribution to the \noverall mass balance is small, typically contributing <1% of the total pesticide mass). In both \ncases it is revealed that a significant mass of diuron is lost during the experiment. \nInterestingly, the relative mass losses between the two samples are nearly identical which \nsuggests that the same phenomena is responsible for the pesticide removal. One possible \ncause of this concentration reduction is sorption to the filters which is contrary to the findings \nof Gu\u00e9guen et al. (2002) and Hoffman et al. (2000) who found good recovery for DOC and \nNOM respectively using the same regenerated cellulose filters. Indeed, studies we have \ncarried out have shown also shown good recovery for DOC, with the majority concentrated in \nthe 1kDa fraction, indicative of fulvic acids (Gooddy et al., 2006). However, evidence of \nsorption of some pharmaceutical chemicals to regenerated cellulose-based membranes has \nbeen reported by Burba et al. (2005). Significantly the nominal surface area of all the \nultrafiltration cassettes is 0.5 m2 but the rate of removal is not constant so sorption may not be \nthe only process causing the observed concentration drop. Alternatively, the colloidal material \nmay be getting entrapped in the filter matrix, however, blank procedures ran between \nfractions showed no desorption or disentrapment of any pesticide material. Another \npossiblility for the mass loss could be due to coagulation and flocculation of colloidal material \nas a result of the change in concentration of charged ions in the permeate solution. This can \nlead to the formation of an insoluble precipitate that would not be captured in the HPLC \nanalysis and so ostensibly lost from the mass balance calculations. \n \nAlthough this is an important observation in terms of the overall TFF method for fractionating \npesticides, it is considered that the overall finding of greater association with the larger \ncolloidal fraction is still valid and of significance in terms of pesticide transport. Additionally \nit should be noted that the concentration of the pesticide in the 0.45\u00b5m and 0.1\u00b5m retentates \nis much greater than the mass of pesticide lost from these two fractions. \n \nGroundwater Pesticide Colloid Complexes \n \nThree of the phenylurea concentrations (DCPU has been omitted for clarity but follows a very \nsimilar pattern to DCPMU) for the unfiltered water and 6 retentate fractions taken from the \ngroundwater sample are shown in Figure 4. The parent compound, diuron shows a decrease of \n  9\nroughly 20% in concentration from 2.3 \u00b5g\/L in the raw water to roughly 1.8\u00b5g\/L in the \n0.45\u00b5m fraction. The subsequent four fractions remain at this relatively constant \nconcentration before a further slight decrease in concentration in the 1kDa retentate. DCPMU \nshows a more rapid decrease in concentration between the raw water and the 0.1\u00b5m retentate \n(nearly 60%) before stabilising at this concentration. DCA shows very rapid initial decline in \nconcentration from 2.8 \u00b5g\/L in the raw water to 1.5 \u00b5g\/L in the 0.45\u00b5m retentate. These \nconcentrations remain stable until declining again in the final two fractions. There is no \nevidence for any colloidal-pesticide complexes existing in this sample. \n \nThe relatively high concentration of degradation products and the decline in concentrations of \nall the phenyl urea compounds may be indicative of some degradation occurring during the \nexperiment since relatively large volumes of water were being processed which require at \nleast 24 hours per retentate fraction. However, this rate of removal is considerably in excess \nof degradation rates observed (Gooddy et al., 2002) where 20% of the parent compound had \nbeen converted to metabolites in the soil matrix after 50 days and it is unlikely to be the \nprimary reason for the loss in concentration during the experiment. Some sorption or \nentrapment on to the filtration cartridges along with the formation of insoluble precipitates in \nthe permeate are therefore again suspected. Even with these losses it appears that there is no \nrelationship between colloidal fraction and pesticide for a groundwater sampled from roughly \n30 metres below ground level. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThese experiments have demonstrated that pesticides will form an association with colloids \nfrom a calcareous soil and produce pesticide-colloid complexes which have a size generally in \nexcess of 0.1\u00b5m. However, in a groundwater sample taken from depth no such association \nwith colloids is observed. This is despite the previous observations of Johnson et al. (2001) \nand Gooddy et al (2001) which strongly suggested that pesticide concentrations in the shallow \ngroundwater were controlled, at least in part, by the association of pesticides with colloidal \nmaterial. This infers that either our method was too insensitive analytically to detect \npesticides bound to colloids in the groundwater, or that the pesticide present was in a free (i.e. \nunbound) form and that the colloidal material had been removed during the migration of the \nwater through the unsaturated and\/or saturated zone prior to sampling. \n \n  10\nIf we consider the first case, and assume that our analytical method is too insensitive, some \nsimple calculations can be performed to confirm or refute this.  \n \nAssuming an initial total volume of groundwater of 50 litres, and a retentate volume of \n900 ml, this would produce a colloid pre-concentration factor of 55.6 (the ratio of the initial \nvolume to the retentate volume). With an initial pesticide concentration of 4\u00b5g\/L and an \nassumed pesticide-colloid association percentage of, for example 5%, after one full filtration \ncycle the permeate would have a pesticide concentration of 3.8\u00b5g\/L and the retentate would \nhave a pesticide concentration of 14.9\u00b5g\/L. We can repeat this for a range of  association \npercentages as demonstrated in Figure 5 where the % of pesticide-colloid associated \ncompounds ranges from 5% down to 0.1%. \n \nAn initial concentration 2.3\u00b5g\/L has been used for diuron and an analytical error of \u00b1 5% has \nbeen assumed to reflect the conditions observed in the groundwater fractionation. The graph \ndemonstrates how the difference between the retentate increases as the percentage of \npesticides associated with colloids increases. The graph also demonstrates that there is clear \ndivergence between the retentate and permeate concentrations where just 0.3% of the \npesticide is associated with colloidal material, even with the analytical variation of \u00b1 5%. The \ndata presented in Table 1 and 2 for the >0.45 \u00b5m and >0.1\u00b5m retentate fractions both have \ncolloid-pesticide association factors close to 3.5%. Therefore, the method appears to be \nsensitive enough to detect even a small degree of pesticide-colloid association. Hence, we \nsuggest that colloidal material and the pesticides associated with it have been removed \nsomewhere between the soil zone and the saturated zone from where the sample was taken. \n \nPreviously there has been much evidence cited to support the existence of significant bypass \nflow in the Chalk. This includes the observed rapid response of the water table after high \nintensity rainfall events (Headworth, 1972) and the appearance of bacteria in abstraction \nwaters (Maclean, 1969). By contrast, a study by Smith et al. (1970) examining the tritium \ncontent in unsaturated zone pore-waters led to the suggestion that flow through the Chalk \nunsaturated zone was predominately through the matrix at a mean rate of around 0.8 m\/year. \nA generation of models got round this by assuming flow to occur exclusively in fractures with \nsolute transport being retarded by molecular diffusion into the matrix (Oakes et al., 1981; \nBarker and Foster, 1981). However, through using a transient flow and transport, dual-\npermeability model and examining the effects of diffusion in the Chalk unsaturated zone, \n  11\nMathias et al. (2005, 2006) showed that, at depth, almost all of the flow in the unsaturated \nzone was in the matrix. \n \nIn the very shallow unsaturated zone, just below the soil layer, Ireson et al. (2006) found that \nat 0.4 and 1.0 m depth there tends to be a rapid increase in matric potential straight after the \nmain rainfall events, which was followed by a more gradual recession, as the profile drained. \nHowever, below 4 m depth this was completely attenuated and only a long-term rise was \nnoticed. A similar feature can also be seen in the matric potential data presented by Hodnett \nand Bell (1990). These higher matric potentials allow more of the fractures to hold and \ntransmit water, as was found by Haria et al. (2003). Consequently preferential flow can occur \nin fractures in the top 4-5 m of the Chalk unsaturated zone, but it is unlikely to occur at \ngreater depths. \n \nIt would appears therefore that the previous observations of Gooddy et al (2001) and Johnson \net al (2001) pertaining to the likelihood colloidal transport of pesticides were correct. The fact \nthat they were found at the study site was a function of the shallow depth from which the \nsamples were taken. Preferential flow of colloidally associated pesticides was able to occur \ndown to sufficient depth to allow the large particles to reach the water table without being \nfiltered out by the small pore-throat size of the Chalk matrix.  \n \nWe can therefore propose two conceptual models for pesticide transport to chalk \ngroundwater; one where the unsaturated zone is shallow and colloidally mediated transport of \npesticides can be deemed a important and rapid (Figure 6a), and the other where the \nunsaturated zone is deep and the majority of the colloidal material which has been identified \nby this study to form pesticides complexes (i.e. particles >0.1\u00b5m) is removed by the narrow \napertures of the chalk matrix (Figure 6b). In both of these models it is worthy to note that \npesticides can also move in the \u2018dissolved\u2019 phase through both the matrix and the fractures. \nHowever, the important aspect of the colloidally bound route is that poorly soluble \ncompounds (like most pesticides which would be expected to reside in the soil at the point of \napplication) are made considerably more mobile and there is the potential for relatively high \nconcentrations of pesticides to enter the shallow groundwater system. \n \nConclusions \n \n  12\nThrough this study we have found that the calcareous soils, typical of those overlying the \nChalk aquifer in most of southern England, can form pesticide-colloid complexes. These \ncomplexes contain particles that are mostly larger than 0.1\u00b5m. Metabolites, which are subtly \ndifferent in structure, behave in an analogous manner to the parent compound which suggest \nthe binding mechanism is the same between the different molecule types. There is evidence \nfor some sorption or entrapment of diuron (and metabolites) to the regenerated cellulose \nfilters and the possibility that some precipitates have been formed during the filtration \nprocess.. \n \nNo association was found between colloids and pesticides in the deep groundwater. Based on \ndata from previous studies we have interpreted this finding in terms on the relative  \nimportance of the properties of the chalk unsaturated zone as a effective barrier to colloid- \npesticide complexes. Shallow groundwaters are therefore more vulnerable to contamination \nnot just because the potential travel distance is shorter but because they allow colloidally-\ncomplexed pesticides (and by inference, other organic contaminants) to reach the water table \nby a rapid route. Compounds that are relatively insoluble and considered immobile may \ntherefore enter a groundwater body. The presence of a deep unsaturated zone will mean that, \nbecause of their size, most of the colloidal-complexes will be removed by filtration as they \npass into the narrow chalk pore-throats. In this case the majority of pesticide transport will \noccur in a \u2018dissolved\u2019 form through the more gradual \u2018piston-flow\u2019 route. \n \nIn terms of practical considerations of this finding, it may be important for land-use \nmanagement and manure applications where the depth to water is shallow. On Chalk down-\nland this may mean not applying agricultural wastes in the lower parts of the valley, even \nwhere no surface water body is evident or close-by. Additionally it implies that deeper \ngroundwaters are relatively well protected from sudden pulses of pesticide contamination \nfollowing application or a spill. The filtration of pesticides bound to colloids will also \ndecrease the net loading to groundwater. Producing pesticides that are strongly  bound to soil \ncolloids, and remain  bound, may therefore act as a good groundwater protection measure. \n  \n \nAcknowledgements \n  13\nThis work was carried out under funding from the British Geological Survey.
