The \nobservations were made over two sandy rippled beds, classified as \u2018medium\u2019 and \n\u2018fine\u2019 in terms of sand grain size, under slightly asymmetric regular waves. For the \nmedium sand, the ripples that formed had relatively steep slopes, while for the fine \nsand, the slopes were roughly half that of the medium sand.  In the medium sand case, \nthe form of the sediment diffusivity profiles was found to be constant with height \nabove the bed, to a height equal approximately to the equivalent roughness of the bed, \nks, while above this the sediment diffusivity increased linearly with height. For the \ncase of the fine sand there was no constant region; the sediment diffusivity simply \nincreased linearly with height from the bed. To understand the difference between the \nrespective diffusivity profiles, advantage has been taken of the high temporal-spatial \nresolution available with acoustic systems. Using intra-wave ensemble averaging, \ndetailed images have been built up of the variation in concentration with both the \nphase of the wave and also height above the bed. These intra-wave observations, \ncombined with measurements of the bed forms and concepts of convective and \ndiffusive entrainment, have been used to elucidate the mixing mechanisms that \nunderlie the form of the diffusivity profiles observed over the two rippled beds.  These \nmechanisms centre on coherent vortex shedding in the case of steeply rippled beds \nand random turbulent processes above ripples of lower steepness.  \n \n 2\n I Introduction 45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n \nIn many marine environments, from river estuaries through to the offshore regime, \nsuspended sediments are a significant component of the total sediment transport and, \nin numerous cases, are dominant. It is therefore necessary to obtain a description of \nhow the sediments are entrained into the water column and to ascertain the resulting \nform of the suspended sediment concentration profile. Predictions for the form of the \nconcentration profile differ according to the flow, the seabed sediment and, \nimportantly, any resulting bed forms (Sleath, 1984; Soulsby, 1997; Van Rijn et al., \n2001). Most of the formulations used have been underpinned by the classical Fickian \nconcept of gradient diffusion (Coleman, 1970; Glenn and Grant, 1987; Vincent and \nGreen, 1990; Vincent and Osborne, 1995; Ogston and Sternberg, 2002; van der Werf \net al., 2006), originating from kinetic molecular theory where random molecular \nmovements induce mixing.  In the case of suspended sediments in field situations, it is \nthe turbulent fluctuations in the vertical velocity component that give rise to the \nupward mixing process. In the simplest case the time averaged vertical turbulent \ndiffusive flux of sediment, qv, is considered to be balanced by the settling of the \nsuspended sediment under gravity, such that: \nCwq sv =        where           z\nC\n\u03b5q sv \u2202\n\u2202\u2212=                                   (1)                              63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \nHere C is the time-averaged sediment concentration at height z above the bed, ws is \nthe sediment settling velocity, and \u03b5s is the sediment diffusivity. The vertical profile of \n\u03b5s is frequently linked to the eddy viscosity, \u03bdt, used to model the transfer of \nmomentum by turbulent eddies. The eddy viscosity, \u03bdt, represents the product of a \nturbulent velocity scale and a mixing length scale. Both of these factors therefore \naffect the sediment diffusivity which is commonly expressed as \u03b5s = \u03b2\u03bdt where the \ncoefficient \u03b2 is either assumed to be a constant (equal to unity, or larger or smaller \nthan unity) or is sometimes considered to have a functional dependence upon the \nsediment in suspension and the flow parameters (Van Rijn, 1984; Whitehouse, 1995; \nRose and Thorne, 2001). The vertical profile of \u03bdt, and hence \u03b5s, in previous \napplications has been taken to be constant, linear, parabolic, exponential or some \ncombination thereof (Grant and Madsen, 1979; Nowell and Long, 1983; Nezu and \nRodi, 1986; Nielsen, 1992; Van Rijn, 1993; Chung and Van Rijn, 2003). These \n 3\n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \ndifferent forms have been associated with various concepts regarding the mixing in \nthe near-bed boundary layer. Hitherto, there has been no consensus on a general form \nfor profiles of the sediment diffusivity or eddy viscosity, though constant (Nielsen, \n1986; van der Werf et al., 2006) and linear profiles (Ribberink and Al-Salem, 1994; \nVincent and Osborne, 1995) with height above the bed have been used in many near-\nbed sediment studies.  \n \nDespite the wide use of gradient diffusion, several studies (Sleath, 1982; Hansen et \nal., 1991; Ribberink and Al-Salem, 1994; Osborne and Vincent, 1992; Freds\u00f8e et al., \n1999; Villard and Osborne, 2002; Thorne et al., 2003) have indicated that this is not \nalways the dominant process generating the suspended sediment concentration profile, \nparticularly for sediment entrainment by waves over rippled beds.  These studies have \nshown that, if the ripples are relatively steep with \u03b7r\/\u03bbr \u2265 0.12, where \u03b7r is the ripple \nheight and \u03bbr is the ripple wavelength, then the mixing close to the bed is dominated \nby a coherent process involving boundary layer separation on the lee-side of the ripple \ncrest during each wave half-cycle near maximum flow velocity.  The resulting lee-\nwake vortex remains attached to the bed entraining sediment into the flow as it grows \nin size and strength.  At flow reversal the sediment-laden vortex is ejected into the \nwater column, carrying sediment to several ripple heights above the bed. This process \nis coherent and repeatable, with two main periods of sediment entrainment during the \ncycle at around the times of flow reversal. The sediment mixing process is thus \nfundamentally different from that associated with gradient diffusion. Gradient \ndiffusion relies on the \u2018mixing length\u2019 being small compared with the vertical extent \nof the concentration profile as a whole, and the rate of diffusion is proportional to the \nconcentration gradient (Equation (1)).  In contrast, the mixing due to vortex \nentrainment occurs on a (relatively) larger \u2018convective\u2019 length scale that is not, \ntherefore, linked so directly to the concentration gradient.  Interestingly, the \u2018finite \nmixing length\u2019 approach proposed by of Nielsen and Teakle (2004) offers a novel way \nof reconciling the two different physical concepts contrasted above. Nielsen (1988, \n1992) had earlier suggested that in many circumstances, particularly involving rippled \nbeds under waves and also combined waves and currents, both convective and \ndiffusive processes occur together and, in some recent studies (Lee and Hanes, 1996; \nLee et al., 2002; Thorne et al., 2002), this approach has been adopted.   \n 4\n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n \nThe present study represents a contribution towards our understanding of these \nfundamental mixing processes.  Measurements were collected in a large flume, the \nDeltaflume, Deltares (formerly WL|Delft Hydraulics), the Netherlands, which is 240 \nm long, 5 m wide and 7 m deep. The size of the flume allowed the wave and sediment \ntransport processes to be studied at full scale (Williams et al., 2003; \nhttp:\/\/www.wldelft.nl\/facil\/delta). Simultaneous, closely co-located observations were \nmade of: suspended sediment concentration, suspended particle size, the flow and the \nripples on the sandy beds. The data were obtained beneath regular weakly-\nasymmetrical surface waves over beds of medium and fine sand. These data are used \nhere to examine the sediment diffusivity profiles over the two sandy beds. To interpret \nthe form of the observed sediment diffusivity, advantage is taken of the high \ntemporal-spatial resolution available with acoustic systems.  In particular, intra-wave \nensemble averaging, coupled with bed form measurements, have been used to build \nup detailed images of the variation in concentration with both the phase of the wave \nand also the height above the bed. These data have been used to highlight the \nunderlying entrainment mechanisms that led to the form of the measured sediment \ndiffusivity profiles presented in this study.   \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n \nThe paper is laid out as follows; in Section II a physical discussion is presented of the \nkey modelling concepts, followed in Section III, by a summary of the observational \nwork and data analysis.  In Section IV the measurements are presented and interpreted \nto explain the different profiles for the sediment diffusivity, obtained above the two \nsandy beds, in terms of convective and diffusive processes. This is followed in \nSection V by a discussion on the implications of the observations, with conclusions \ndrawn in Section VI.  \n \n 5\nII Models 137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n}\n \nA modelling framework can be set out for turbulent oscillatory flows above various \nnaturally occurring bed types in terms of the wave Reynolds number, RE = A0U0\/\u03bd, \nwhere A0 is the orbital amplitude, U0 is the near-bed velocity amplitude and \u03bd is the \nkinematic viscosity, and the relative roughness, A0\/ks, where ks is the equivalent bed \nroughness (Davies and Villaret, 1997).  Table 1 summarises a simplified framework \nfor oscillatory flows above erodible sandy beds (see also Davies and Thorne, 2008).  \nEssentially, steeply rippled beds having \u03b7r\/\u03bbr \u2265 0.12 occur in low energy flows; such \nripples tend to be long-crested (two-dimensional) with vigorous, alternate eddy \nshedding occurring above them.  Such ripples are characterised by low values of RE, \nA0\/ks and also of ( ){ 50s0 gd\u02c6\u02c6 \u03c1\u2212\u03c1\u03c4=\u03b8 where 0\u03c4\u02c6 is the peak bed shear stress during the \nwave cycle, \u03c1s and \u03c1 are the densities of the sediment and water respectively, and d50 \nis the median grain diameter.  For larger values of the respective non-dimensional \nparameters the ripples are reduced in amplitude and tend to have shorter crest-lengths \n(2D-3D \u2018transitional\u2019 ripples).  Ultimately, for high energy flows, \u2018dynamically plane\u2019 \nbeds occur; here any ripples that are present are of such small steepness (\u03b7r\/\u03bbr \u2264 0.08) \nthat the oscillatory flow becomes closely similar dynamically to that above a plane \nbed.  [It may be noted that the beds referred to here as \u2018dynamically plane\u2019 are \ncommonly denoted also, in the limit of very high mobility, as \u2018upper stage plane \nbeds\u2019]  The equivalent roughness, ks, depends upon the grain size for flat sandy beds \nwith, typically, ks = 2.5d50 for \u2018lower stage plane beds\u2019, and upon the ripple height and \nsteepness for rippled beds, ks \u221d \u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr), with ks enhanced by a \u2018mobile bed\u2019 \ncontribution for low ripples and plane beds in high energy flows. \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n \nIt was noted by Davies and Villaret (1997) that many of the modelling concepts \ndeveloped for steady turbulent flow remain valid in oscillatory flow.  Above smooth \nflat beds, at high RE, the turbulent eddy viscosity may be assumed to vary linearly \nwith height throughout the wave boundary layer.  However, for rougher beds, also at \nhigh RE, data suggest the existence of an outer layer in which the turbulent velocity \nscale decreases with height and in which, therefore, \u03bdt remains approximately constant \n(e.g. Trowbridge and Madsen, 1984).  The wave boundary layer thickness is \noverestimated by models that do not include this outer, constant, \u03bdt-layer.  Several \n 6\n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \neddy viscosity models have assumed, either implicitly or explicitly, that \u03bdt is also \ntime-varying (Trowbridge and Madsen, 1984; Freds\u00f8e, 1984; Davies, 1986).   \n \nThe models above are all based upon turbulent diffusion as the dominant mechanism \nof momentum exchange.  In contrast, at lower flow stages above very rough and \nrippled beds, the situation is entirely different.  Here momentum transfer is due \nmainly to eddy shedding from individual roughness elements at times of flow \nreversal, and so is well organised in space and time.  For relatively low values of RE \nand  A0\/ks (Table 1) Sleath (1991) and Nielsen (1992) suggested that it is reasonable \nto treat \u03bdt as constant in height and time.  For the range 1\u2264 A0\/ks \u2264 120, Sleath (1991) \nproposed the following expression for \u03bdt by analogy with grid-turbulence \nexperiments: \n\u03c9=\u03bd 2123 s0t kA00253.0                                              (2) 182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \nwhere the angular frequency \u03c9 = U0\/A0.  Subsequently, on the basis of data sets for \nvery rough conditions in the range A0\/ks < 16, Nielsen (1992) proposed the constant \neddy viscosity: \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \ns0t kA004.0 \u03c9=\u03bd                                                       (3) \nThese two formulae give identical results for A0\/ks = 2.5. \n \nAlthough turbulence is strongly related to eddy shedding, it is the coherent vortex \nshedding mechanism itself that dominates the mixing in the near-bed layer above very \nrough and rippled beds.  Ranasoma and Sleath (1992) demonstrated experimentally \nthat the effect of turbulent Reynolds stresses above steep ripples is negligible in \ncomparison with the momentum transfer associated with coherent vortices.  Their \nmeasurements showed large time variations in the vertical transfer of momentum \ncorresponding to the release of coherent vortex structures at the ripple crest.  This was \nreflected in the \u2018convective eddy viscosity\u2019 coefficient used by Davies and Villaret \n(1997) who introduced time variation into \u03bdt in order to represent the combined \neffects on momentum transfer of turbulence and, more importantly, organised eddy \nshedding at flow reversal. \n \nThe vertical mixing of sediment is necessarily closely related to the vertical transfer of \nmomentum.  If the bed is flat, the periodic surface-wave-induced vertical velocity, ww, \n 7\nis very small in the near-bed layer, tending to zero at the bed itself.  Thus ww may be \nassumed to contribute little to the upward flux of sediment \n203 \nwwCw  near the bed, \nwhere Cw is the periodic component of the suspended concentration and the over-bar \ndenotes time averaging.  Rather higher above the bed, it has been shown by Sheng and \nHay (1995) that this flux remains relatively small, with typically \n204 \n205 \n206 \n2.0CwCw sww < .  \nThis suggests the validity of the following approximation, related to turbulent \nprocesses only, for the upward sediment flux above a flat bed (c.f. Equation (1)): \n207 \n208 \n209 \nzd\nCd\n\u03b5w'C' s\u2248\u2212                                       (4) 210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \nwhere the primes here denote, respectively, the random turbulent contributions to the \nconcentration and the vertical velocity.   \n \nIn contrast, above a rippled bed, the sloping sides of the bed forms give rise to locally \nsignificant, periodic, vertical velocity contributions arising from both the (frictionless) \nwave action and the (frictional) process of vortex formation.  Thus, in a ripple-\naveraged sense, the (convective) term wwCw  can contribute significantly to the \nupward flux of sediment; in fact, this term can dominate the upward sediment flux in \nthe bottom part of the wave boundary layer.   \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220  \nIf the sediment diffusivity \u03b5s is still identified solely with the turbulent flux wC \u2032\u2032  (c.f. \nEquation (4)), then the time-averaged sediment balance in the case of a rippled bed \nmay be expressed:  \n221 \n222 \n223 \n0\ndz\ndC\n\u03b5CwCw swws =\u2212+\u2212                                       (5) 224 \n225 such that \ndC\/dz\nCwCw\n\u03b5 wwss\n+\u2212=                                               (6) 226 \n227 \n228 \n \nIn the present paper, however, we effectively absorb the convective transfer \nrepresented by wwCw into a \u2018convective diffusivity\u2019 whereby \u03b5s is defined simply by  229 \ndC\/dz\nCw\n\u03b5 ss\n\u2212=                                                     (7) 230 \n 8\n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \nThe physically interesting and practically significant consequences of this widely used \ntechnique are discussed in Section IV where we obtain contrasting vertical profiles for \n\u03b5s based on observations made in the Deltaflume above beds of different grain size.  \nThese measured \u03b5s profiles are compared with three established expressions for \u03b5s; \ntwo of these were specifically formulated for waves propagating above rippled and \nvery rough sand beds, while the third, a linearly increasing diffusivity, is that most \ncommonly used in sediment and flow studies involving plane beds (Grant and \nMadsen, 1979; Lee and Hanes, 1996;  Lee, Friedrichs and Vincent, 2002).  These \nexpressions are discussed here in turn.  \n \nFirstly, Nielsen\u2019s (1992) sediment diffusivity for rough and rippled beds follows from \nthe eddy viscosity formulation (3) and the relationship  \u03b5s = \u03b2\u03bdt wherein the value \nadopted for \u03b2 reflects the relatively high efficiency of the eddy shedding process in \nentraining sediment into suspension.  In particular, Nielsen (1992) adopted \u03b2 = 4 \nleading to the following expression for the near-bed sediment diffusivity: \noss Uk 0.016\u03b5 =                                                                     (8) \nThe physical explanation for the large value of \u03b2 used by Nielsen and others has not \nbeen fully explained by either models or experiments.  However, it would appear to \nbe linked to 2D and\/or 3D temporal-spatial correlations between the instantaneous \nvelocity and concentration fields, as shown by Magar and Davies (2005) using a \nparticle tracking model. \n \nNielsen\u2019s (1992) proposed expression for the equivalent roughness ks in equation (8) \nwas ks = \u03b4\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr) where \u03b4 = 8.  However, as explored by Thorne et al. (2002), this \nrather low value for \u03b4 does not take into account the convective contribution to the \nupward mixing of momentum and sediment.  Here therefore, following Thorne et al. \n(2002) we have adopted the more commonly used value \u03b4 = 25 (Swart, 1974) in \nequation (8) and determined \u03b5s using detailed in-situ measurements of the ripple \ndimensions, \u03b7r and \u03bbr, made in the Deltaflume. \n \nThe second formulation for \u03b5s highlighted in Section IV is that of Van Rijn (1993).  \nThis was derived empirically for waves alone and involves a three-layer structure for \n 9\n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n\u03b5s covering the full water column.  Importantly, it represents the sediment diffusivity \nin the near-bed layer (z  \u2264 \u03b6s) as being constant with height: \nbs \u03b5\u03b5 =                                              z \u2264\u03b6s                               9(a) \nms \u03b5\u03b5 =                                            z \u2265 0.5h                          9(b) \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212+=\ns\ns\nbmbs \u03b60.5h\n\u03b6z)\u03b5(\u03b5\u03b5\u03b5              \u03b6s <z<0.5h                       9(c) 267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n \nHere \u03b5b and \u03b5m are, respectively, constant values for the sediment diffusivity near the \nbed and in the upper half of the water column, with the latter value being the larger; \u03b6s \nis the thickness of the near-bed mixing layer and h is the water depth. This eddy \ndiffusivity is constant in the near-bed layer, is linearly increasing with height in the \nlayer above this, and then remains constant in the upper half of the flow.  Van Rijn \nsuggested a lower layer thickness given by \u03b6s = 3\u03b7r.  In the present paper, we have \nadopted the expression \u03b6s = ks (=25\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr)) for ease of comparison with Nielsen\u2019s \nformulation.  It may be noted that Van Rijn\u2019s expression is recovered from this for \nripples having a steepness of \u03b7r\/\u03bbr = 0.12.  In Section IV, due to variations in the \nobserved ripple steepness in different experimental runs, this results in \u03b6s =(3.4\u00b10.2)\u03b7r \nfor the medium sand bed and  \u03b6s \u2248 (1.9\u00b10.2)\u03b7r for the fine sand bed. Assuming that \u03b6s \n= ks, Van Rijn\u2019s formulation can be expressed in the same form as that of Nielsen, \nnamely: \nosbb Uk\u03b1\u03b5 =                                                                (10)                           282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \nin which Van Rijn\u2019s coefficient \u03b1b = 0.004D*, wherein the dimensionless grain size D* \n= d50[(s-1)g\/\u03c52]1\/3; s is the relative density \u03c1s\/\u03c1, \u03c1s is the grain density and \u03c1 is the fluid \ndensity; g is the acceleration due to gravity; and \u03c5 is the kinematic viscosity. The eddy \ndiffusivity in the upper layer is given by Van Rijn (1993) as: \nT\nHh\n\u03b1\u03b5 mm =                                                                       (11) 287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \nwhere H is the wave height, T is the wave period and the empirical coefficient \n\u03b1m=0.035. In the present study, where the measurements were confined to the bottom \nquarter of the water column, it is only predictions for the near-bed constant and linear \nregions that are assessed. \n \n 10\n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \nThe final form used for the sediment diffusivity is a simple linear increase in \u03b5s with \nheight above the bed. This is commonly expressed (Grant and Madsen, 1979; Lee and \nHanes, 1996; Lee, Friedrichs and Vincent, 2002) as \n \nzu\u03b2\u03ba\u03b5 *s =                                                                (12) 297 \n298 where \u03ba=0.4 is Von Karman\u2019s constant. Here we have used the mean magnitude of \nthe friction velocity, *u , in the wave cycle as representative of the turbulent mixing \nduring the wave cycle as a whole (see Davies, 1986):  \n299 \n300 \n301  \no\n0.5\nw* U\/2)(f763.0u =     and          \n52.0\no\ns\nw A\nk\n0.237f \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=                             (13) 302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n \nwhere fw is the friction factor formulated by Soulsby (1997). In applying equation \n(12) to the observations, consideration must be given to the appropriate expression to \nbe used for ks in the analysis. For a flat (or lower stage plane) bed the Nikuradse \nroughness value is normally used which, as noted earlier, is commonly expressed as \nks=2.5d50. The implications of using this skin-friction expression over a rippled bed \nare considered in Section IV. \n \n \n \n \n 11\nIII Experimental arrangement and data analysis 314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n \nThe study was undertaken as part of a collaborative European experiment, and was \nconducted in the Deltaflume. Details of the experimental arrangement have been \nprovided in an earlier publication (Thorne et al., 2002) and are therefore only briefly \nsummarised here for completeness. The large size of this flume, 240 m in length, 5 m \nin width and 7 m deep, allow hydrodynamic and sediment transport phenomena to be \nstudied at full scale.  The experiments were conducted beneath weakly-asymmetrical, \nregular, surface waves with heights, H, and periods, T, in the respective ranges H=0.6-\n1.1 m and T=4\u20136 s for the medium sand and H=0.5-1.1 m and T=4\u20135 s for the fine \nsand. Therefore the hydrodynamic conditions for the experiments involving the two \nsands were comparable. The medium sand had  d10=170 \u03bcm, d50=330 \u03bcm and d90=700 \n\u03bcm, while the fine sand had d10=95 \u03bcm, d50=160 \u03bcm and d90=300 \u03bcm; both the sands \nwere therefore reasonably well sorted. The sediments were located in a layer of \nthickness 0.5 m and length 30 m, approximately halfway along the flume, where the \nmean water depth was 4.5 m. The measurements were conducted first above the \nmedium sand bed; this was then removed and replaced by the fine sand bed.  \n \nFigure 1 shows the instrumented tripod platform \u2018STABLE\u2019 (Sediment Transport And 332 \nBoundary Layer Equipment) used to collect the measurements. The main instruments \non STABLE relevant to the present study were: a multi-frequency acoustic \nbackscatter system, ABS, a pumped sampling system, an acoustic ripple profiler, \nARP, and electromagnetic current meters, ECMs. All measurements were \nsynchronised. A study of the impact of STABLE on the processes being measured \nwas shown to be minimal (Williams et al., 2003). Typically an experiment consisted \nof propagating waves over the bed for about an hour, until the bed-forms came to \nnominal equilibrium, and then collecting data for a 17 min period.  \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n \nHigh-resolution vertical profiles of the suspended sediments were measured using a \ntriple-frequency ABS (Crawford and Hay, 1993; Thorne et al., 1997; Thorne and \nHanes, 2002).  The ABS provided 128 backscatter profiles each second, at each of the \nthree frequencies, 1 MHz, 2 MHz and 4 MHz. Each profile consisted of 128 range \nbins, with a spatial resolution of 0.01 m, thereby covering a range of 1.28 m.

The collected \nsamples of the suspension were sieved to provide the mass size distribution with \nheight above the bed.  They were used to calibrate and assess the veracity of the \nacoustic backscatter measurements and provide profiles of ws. To establish whether \nripples were present on the bed, and to monitor their evolution and migration, a \nspecifically designed acoustic ripple profiler, ARP, (Bell et al., 1998; Thorne et al., \n2002; Williams et al, 2004) was used. The ARP operated at 2.0 MHz, and provided \nsub-centimetric measurements of the bed location over a 3m transect along the \ndirection of wave propagation.  To measure the flow three ECMs were located at 0.3, \n0.6 and 0.91 m above the bed. They provided measurements of the along-flume and \nvertical components of the flow velocity at 8 Hz.  \n \nMeasurements of the suspended concentration were collected with the ABS. Using the \nparticle size data obtained from the pumped samples an explicit acoustic inversion \n(Thorne and Hanes, 2002) was carried out on the recorded 17 min averaged \nbackscatter voltages to convert them to mean concentration profiles. For each \nexperiment three independent concentration profiles were obtained, one for each \nfrequency. Since 13 experiments were carried out above the medium sand and 7 were \ncarried out above the fine sand, this resulted in 39 and 21 mean concentration profiles \nin the respective cases.  Using the bed echoes the concentration profiles were \nreferenced to the undisturbed bed, such that in the plots that follow z is the height \nabove the undisturbed bed, with a vertical sampling interval of 0.01 m. The veracity \nof the profiles has been assessed previously (Thorne et al., 2002) using the pumped \nsample measurements and this is not repeated here. However, for the purpose of \nillustrating the magnitude and form of the concentration profiles for the two sands, \nexamples are provided in Figure 2 for wave conditions H=0.5 m and 0.8 m   and T=5 \ns. The figure shows mean concentrations, averaged over the burst period (17 min, \n~200 wave cycles), at the three acoustic frequencies for the two sands. The detailed \ndifferences between the profiles at the three frequencies are due the accuracy of the \nsystem calibration, the model used for the acoustic scattering properties of the \nsuspended sediments and the inversion methodology employed. However, the \nimportant factor as far as this study is concerned is that the general profile features are \nconsistent across the three frequencies. For the H=0.5 m case it can be seen that the \n 13\n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \nmagnitude of the suspended concentration for the fine sand (x,*,\u0394) is significantly \ngreater than for the medium sand (+,o,\u25a1). This was also the case for H=0.8 m, though \nthe difference was less. This was a general trend for the two sands, with the difference \nin suspended concentration levels decreasing as wave height increased. The form of \nthe profiles can also be seen to be different, with the relative reduction in \nconcentration being greater for the fine sand in the first 0.1 m above the bed while, \nbetween 0.1-0.4 m, the medium sand concentration reduces somewhat more rapidly \nthan the fine.  Above 0.4 m the gradients become comparable for the two sands.   \n \nUsing the mean concentration profiles, the sediment diffusivities \u03b5s were calculated \nfor each experiment using equation (7), with ws determined from a d50s particle size \nprofile empirically fitted to the pumped sample data. The expressions used were: \n \njk\njk\nkjsksj\ns )C(C\n2\nCC\n2\nww\n\u03b5\n\u0394\n\u2212\n++\u2212\n=                                                      (14a) 394 \n2\nzz\nz kj\n+=                                                                (14b) 395 \n396 \n397 \nwith ws given by Soulsby (1997) as: \n \n10.36])1.049D[(10.36\nd\n\u03bdw 0.53*\n2\n50s\ns \u2212+=                              (14c) 398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \nwhere \u0394jk was the separation between range bins j and k. For the near-bed layer 0.01-\n0.21 m above the bed, j and k were taken as adjacent range bins while, between 0.21-\n0.43 m, j and k were defined as two range bins apart and, above 0.43 m, as four range \nbins apart. This increase in the separation of j and k with height above the bed \nsmoothed the derivative of the concentration profile and reduced scatter in the \ndiffusivity profiles. \n \nThe resulting sediment diffusivity profiles were next normalised using four different \nnon-dimensional scalings and they were also averaged in three different ways. The \naim here was to clarify the trends in \u03b5s and assess whether the different approaches \n 14\n409 \n410 \n411 \ngave consistent results.

The three averages used on the normalized \u03b5s data at \neach range bin above the bed were (i) the median which is a relatively robust mean \nwith regard to outliers; (ii) a trimmed mean value which excluded the 20% highest \nand 20% lowest data values; and (iii) a mean based on a simple in-house filter that \nrejected outliers.  These normalised averages were then smoothed using localised \nvertical averaging over intervals that increased in extent with height above the bed, in \norder to further reduce the scatter in the resulting \u03b5s profiles. Range bins 1-20 above \nthe bed had no averaging applied; range bins 21-40 were averaged over three adjacent \nbins; and bins 41-86 were averaged over five adjacent bins.   \n \n \n 15\nIV Sediment diffusivity measurements and interpretation 438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n \n(i) Medium sand \nUsing equation (14), \u03b5s was calculated above the medium sand bed using the ABS \nconcentration profiles, together with the pumped sample particle size profiles. The \nvalues for the suspended sediment size varied from around d50s=230 \u03bcm within a \ncentimetre or two of the bed, to about d50s=170 \u03bcm at 1 m above the bed. The \nreduction in particle size, of about a 30% in the bottom metre above the bed, is small \ncompared with the change in concentration and had a second order effect on the \nvariation of \u03b5s with height above the bed. The results for the 39 sediment diffusivity \nprofiles, from the 13 experiments involving the medium sand, are shown in Figure 3. \nHere it can be seen that the sediment diffusivity is relatively consistent in form in the \nbottom 0.2 m above the bed, having values around 0.001-0.003 m2s-1. Above 0.2 m \nthe values for the sediment diffusivity increase with height above the bed and the \nscatter in the data increases. This increase in scatter with height is due both to noisier \nlower concentration levels at the greater heights and also to the different flow and bed \nconditions associated with the thirteen different experiments. In an attempt to clarify \ntrends in the data, the normalisations in equation (15) were applied to the respective \nsediment diffusivity profiles. The normalized data, shown by the small solid dots in \nFigure 4, have a scatter which is approximately one third that of the data shown in \nfigure 3 and an enhancement in the form of the trends. Although none of the four \nnormalizations collapse all the data on to a single profile, they clearly show a common \ntrend in the sediment diffusivity profile, with a near-bed region that is nominally \nconstant with height above the bed, above which there is a trend of increasing \ndiffusivity with height. It can also be seen that the four different normalizations yield \ncomparable clustering of the data. These normalised data were next averaged and \nsmoothed using the three approaches described at the end of section III. This gave the \nthree averaged results shown in Figures 4(a) to (d), respectively. These averaged \nprofiles clarify significantly the form of the normalized sediment diffusivity with \nheight above the bed. Also, since the different averaging schemes give very \ncomparable results, the veracity of the final trends in the normalised sediment \ndiffusivity profile is considered to be high.  \n \n 16\n471 \n472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \n479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n502 \n503 \nThe final result, obtained using the normalization given by equation (15d), together \nwith averaging over the three means, is the profile shown in Figure 5 represented by \nthe large solid circles. The error bars shown on the final \u03b5s profile were not derived \nfrom the three averages, but were calculated from the whole data set, shown by the \nsmall solid dots in Figure 4, at each height above the bed.  The data show \napproximately constant normalised sediment diffusivity in the region below z\/ks\u22481.3. \nAt heights greater than z\/ks\u22481.3, \u03b5s\/Uoks increases linearly, though above about z\/ks>3, \nthe trend in the data becomes less clear due to increasing scatter, mainly arising from \ntaking the derivative of rather noisy low concentration data at these greater heights \nabove the bed. However, notwithstanding this increase in scatter with height, the data \nclearly show a normalised sediment diffusivity that is approximately constant for \nz\/ks\u22641.3 and above which there is a linear increase with height.  \n \nUsing equation (8), Nielsen\u2019s empirical prediction for the constant normalized \nsediment diffusivity was calculated. This is shown by the dotted line in Figure 5 and \nhas a value of 0.016. This prediction is somewhat less than the presently inferred, \nmeasured value of 0.029. The lower value given by equation (8) could indicate that \nNielsen\u2019s assumed value of \u03b2 = 4 linking the sediment diffusivity to the eddy viscosity \nshould be larger, or that the constant term of 0.004 in equation (3) is somewhat \nunderestimated. In any event, the agreement between Nielsen\u2019s predictions and the \nmeasurements is not considered to be unreasonable, given the accuracy of the \npreviously available data upon which equation (8) was based.  \n  \nConsidering next the Van Rijn formulation for the constant sediment diffusivity layer, \nthe value predicted by equations (9a & 10) is 0.028 which is very close to the value \nobtained here. Given the limited measurements upon which equations (9a & 10) were \nbased, the agreement may be somewhat fortuitous. However, the main feature of a \nnear bed constant diffusivity, with a value close to both Nielsen\u2019s and Van Rijn\u2019s \npredictions, does indicate that the present observed magnitude and form for the \nsediment diffusivity is not unreasonable.  Unlike the Nielsen formulation, the Van \nRijn one also involves a linearly increasing sediment diffusivity above z\/ks>1. Using \nequation (9b, 9c & 11) the predicted linear portion of the normalized sediment \ndiffusivity does not result in a single curve for the present normalization.  Therefore, \n 17\n504 \n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \nrather than showing the calculations for each case, the bounds from the calculations \nare given by the two dashed lines. The spread is not large and is associated primarily \nwith changes in the wave period, together with the assumptions implicit in the \ndetermination of \u03b5m via Equations (9b) and (11) which cannot be validated here.  \nAgain, given the limited data upon which equations (9-11) were based, the predictions \nare considered to be in reasonable agreement with the present data, though \noverestimating their value in the linear region. However, simply by increasing the \nlower layer thickness \u03b6s from ks to 1.3ks brings the centre line of the linear predictions \nmuch closer to the observations.  \n \nTo complete the comparison of predictions with observations, equation (12) has been \nevaluated using equation (13), and the result has then been normalised to yield: \n \ns\nw\nos\ns\nk\nz\n2\nf\n\u03b20.763\nUk\n\u03b5 \u03ba=                                                          (17) 517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \n \nIf equation (17) is evaluated using a mean value for fw, from all the medium sand \nexperiments, calculated using ks=25\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr) in equation (13) and with \u03b2=1, the \npredictions for the sediment diffusivity (\u2018\u00d7\u2019 in Figure 5) substantially overestimate the \nobserved values in the linear region. However, if fw is calculated using a flat bed \napproximation ks=2.5d50 based on the grain size, then equation (17), again with \u03b2=1, \nyields the line in Figure 5 represented by the \u2018+\u2019 symbols.  Evidently this latter \noutcome compares very favourably with the data in the linear region, with only a \nmarginal underestimation of the diffusivity occurring. However, this result could be \ncoincidental, since, from equations (12) and (13), *u  has only a weak power \ndependence upon ks of 0.26. In any event, what is clear is that the use of equation \n(12), with an equivalent roughness based on   ks=25\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr), significantly \noverestimates the present observations of sediment diffusivity. \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \n531 \n532 \n533 \n534 \n \nFinally, in order to capture the behaviour of the diffusivity in this case involving the \nmedium sand, simple expressions have been fitted to the present data set to yield \nempirical expressions for the variation of sediment diffusivity with height above the \n 18\n535 \n536 \n537 \n538 \nbed. These expressions, which are consistent with those of both Nielsen and Van Rijn \nin the bottom layer and with Van Rijn in the linear layer above this, are as follows: \n \nso1s kU\u03be\u03b5 =                               z\u22641.3ks                       (18a) \nso3o2s kU\u03be zU\u03be\u03b5 \u2212=               z\u22651.3ks                       (18b) 539 \n540 \n541 \n542 \n543 \n544 \n545 \n546 \n547 \n548 \n549 \n550 \n551 \n552 \n553 \n554 \n555 \n556 \n557 \n558 \n559 \n560 \n561 \n562 \n563 \n564 \n565 \n566 \n567 \n \nwhere \u03be1=0.029, \u03be2=0.028, \u03be3=0.007 and the expression is given by the solid line in \nfigure 5. Although it is acknowledged that the parameter space of the present study is \nrelatively limited, it was considered of interest to put the above expressions forward, \nsince they are compatible with the other formulations and suitable for comparison \nwith diffusivities based on any new or emerging data sets. \n \nTo elucidate the processes underlying the form of the sediment diffusivity profile, \nboth the bed forms and also the variation of suspended sediment concentration with \nthe phase of the wave and height above the bed were examined. This takes advantage \nof the bed form measuring capability of acoustics and the high spatial and temporal \nresolution of suspension measurements also provided by acoustics. To illustrate the \ntype of bed forms present on the medium sand, a typical measurement from the ARP \nis shown in Figure 6a. The plot shows the development of a transect, over a 17 min \nperiod, for the case of T=5 s and H=0.81 m. The ripples were well developed with \nmean dimensions of \u03bbr=0.34 m, \u03b7r=0.047 m, and therefore slope of \u03b7r\/ \u03bbr=0.14. This \nwas typical for the medium sand, with \u03b7r and \u03bbr  lying respectively in the range 0.04 \u2013 \n0.06 m and 0.26 \u2013 0.51 m and with \u03b7r\/\u03bbr= 0.12-0.15. Plots of the ripple slopes and \nequivalent roughness, given by ks=25\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr), are shown in Figures 6b and 6c. The \nripple slopes had a mean value of 0.14 which implies that vortex formation and \nentrainment should have occurred (Sleath, 1984). Also the roughness of the bed is \nquite large, around 0.17 m, indicating that the bed is having a major impact on the \nnear-bed flow.  \n \nTo assess the mechanisms of sediment entrainment directly over the medium sand, \nintra-wave processes were investigated. The results are shown in Figure 7; here the \nintra-wave height variation of the ripple-averaged suspended sediment concentration, \nhas been constructed using ensemble wave phase-averaging with an 18\u00b0 interval over \n 19\n568 \n569 \n570 \n571 \n572 \n573 \n574 \n575 \n576 \n577 \n578 \n579 \n580 \n581 \n582 \n583 \n584 \n585 \n586 \n587 \n588 \n589 \n590 \n591 \n592 \n593 \n594 \n595 \n596 \n597 \n598 \n599 \n600 \n200 wave cycles as the ripple slowly migrated below the ABS over the 17 min \nrecording period. The wave conditions were H=1.06 m and T=5s. It can be seen \nclearly that there are two main entrainment events and that these occur close to flow \nreversal; they do not coincide with maximum flow.  Further analysis of this data \n(Thorne et al., 2003; Davies and Thorne, 2005) supported the concept that the \nobservations shown in Figure 7 can be interpreted as arising from flow separation on \nthe lee slope of the ripple, with the consequent generation of growing lee slope \nvortices (Sleath, 1982; Hansen et al., 1991; Vincent et al., 1999; van der Werf et al. \n2007). The vortices, while attached to the bed, entrain sediment and become sediment \nladen.  Then, near flow reversal, they are lifted up into the water column, carrying \nsediment away from the bed.  The processes are not random, but are repeatable and \ncoherent.  Importantly, the layer in which these effects occur may be seen to \ncorrespond to several ripple heights in thickness.  \n \nThe intra-wave observations in Figure 7 may be related to the sediment diffusivity \nprofile in Figure 5 in the following way.  Due to the formation of vortices on the \nripple lee slopes, suspended sediments were contained within a relatively fixed \nmixing region, of height comparable with the ripple height \u03b7r, for most of the wave \ncycle. Near flow reversal the vortices were lifted up into the water column, retaining \ntheir structure to a height of the order of ks. This is consistent with the detailed flow \nmeasurements made by Ranasoma and Sleath (1992) who concluded that vortex \nshedding effects dominate the dynamics in a near-bed layer of thickness at least one \nor two ripple heights above the ripple crest level.  It is the associated coherence of \nsediment entrainment and structure that leads to the constant value for the sediment \ndiffusivity within about z\/ks\u22641.3 (3\u03b7r-4\u03b7r for the medium sand). At heights greater \nthan z\/ks\u22481.3, the coherent structure of the vortices breaks down, with mixing of \nmomentum increasingly becoming dominated by random turbulent processes \n(Ranasoma and Sleath, 1992).  Here, therefore, gradient diffusion dominates and \nmixing increases due to an increase in the mixing length scale with height above the \nbed, leading to the linear increase in sediment diffusivity above the vortex layer.  \n \n \n(ii) Fine sand \n 20\n601 \n602 \n603 \n604 \n605 \n606 \n607 \n608 \n609 \n610 \n611 \n612 \n613 \n614 \n615 \n616 \n617 \n618 \n619 \n620 \n621 \n622 \n623 \n624 \n625 \n626 \n627 \n628 \n629 \n630 \n631 \n632 \n633 \nAgain using equation (14), \u03b5s was calculated for the fine sand bed, using the ABS \nconcentration profiles together with the pumped sample particle size profiles. The \nvalues for the suspended sediment size in this case varied from around d50s=125 \u03bcm \nwithin a centimetre or two of the bed, to about d50s=90 \u03bcm at 1 m above the bed. As \nwith the medium sand the change in particle size with height above the bed did not \nstrongly affect the form of the diffusivity profile. The results for the 21 sediment \ndiffusivity profiles, from the 7 experiments involving the fine sand, are shown in \nFigure 8. Unlike the results for the medium sand, there does not appear to be a region \nof constant sediment diffusivity just above the bed. In contrast, the sediment \ndiffusivity can be seen to increase from around 0.0002-0.0006 m2s-1 close to the bed, \nto values in the region of 0.003-0.01 m2s-1 at 0.8 m above the bed. These values for \u03b5s \nare around one fifth of those for the medium sand near the bed, but are more \ncomparable in magnitude at about 0.8 m above the bed. As with the medium sand, the \nscatter in the data increases with height above the bed, due to noisier lower \nconcentration levels at greater heights and due also to the different flow and bed \nconditions associated with the different experiments. Following the same \nmethodology as described earlier, four normalisations and three averaging procedures \nwere applied to the sediment diffusivity profiles. The results are shown in Figure 9. \nThe different normalisations and averages give consistent results, particularly in \nFigures 9b-9d which show no indication of a constant diffusivity near-bed layer, but \ninstead exhibit a sediment diffusivity that increases linearly with height above the bed. \nAs with the medium sand, the final normalisation, namely equation 15(d), with a \nmean taken from the three averaging schemes, was used to produce the final result \nshown in Figure 10. This shows no indication of a near-bed constant sediment \ndiffusivity, associated in the medium sand measurements with vortex formation and \nentrainment of sediments.  Instead, the results show, in the near-bed region, that the \nnormalised sediment diffusivity increases linearly with height above the bed. Because \nthere is no obvious constant near-bed sediment diffusivity, no useful comparison can \nbe made with the formulations of Nielsen (Eq. (8)) or Van Rijn (Eq. (10)). However, \nit is possible to compare Van Rijn\u2019s linearly increasing sediment diffusivity region \nwith the present data. If, in equation (9c), \u03b6s and \u03b5b are set to zero, then using linear \nwave theory in the determination of \u03b5m we have  \n \n 21\nsm\nos\ns\nk\nzsinh(kh)\n\u03c0\n2\u03b1\nUk\n\u03b5 =                                                       (19) 634 \n635 \n636 \n637 \n638 \n639 \n640 \n641 \n642 \n643 \n644 \n645 \n646 \n647 \n648 \n649 \n650 \n651 \n652 \n653 \n654 \n655 \n656 \n \n \nwhere k is the wave number of the surface waves. Using this expression and taking \nthe mean value of k for all the fine sand experiments, the dashed line in Figure 10 is \nobtained. Evidently the resulting, predicted, normalised sediment diffusivity is \ncomparable with the observed values, though it somewhat overestimates them.  \nReducing \u03b1m from 0.035 to 0.022 brings Van Rijn\u2019s expression into line with the \nobservations. Given the limited data set upon which equation (9c) is based, this \nadjustment does not seem unreasonable. Secondly, equation (12) expressed in the \nform of equation (17) was compared with the data. It is interesting to note that, if  \nequation  (17) is evaluated using ks=25\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr) in equation (12), with \u03b2=1, as shown \nby the \u2018\u00d7\u2019 symbols in Figure 10 the predictions again significantly overestimate the \nobserved values. However, if the flat bed approximation ks=2.5d50 is used, the line in \nFigure 10 represented by the \u2018+\u2019 symbol is obtained, which can be seen to compare \nfavourably with the data, with only a minor overestimation occurring. Given both \nthese fine sand results and also those for the medium sand, it does appear to be the \ncase that the use of ks=25\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr), for a rippled bed, overestimates the roughness \nlength substantially if equation (12) is used to calculate \u03b5s. \n \nFinally if, as in the medium sand case, an empirical fit is made to the data, forcing \n\u03b5s=0 at z=0, then the following expression results: \n \n zU\u03c7\u03b5 o1s =                                                         (20) 657 \n658 \n659 \n660 \n661 \n662 \n663 \n664 \n665 \n \nwhere \u03c71=0.017. This is comparable, though a somewhat smaller gradient than that for \nthe linearly increasing region of the sediment diffusivity in the medium sand case. \n \nTo explain the form of the sediment diffusivity over the fine sand and its difference \nfrom the medium sand, we have again looked at the bed forms. Figure 11 shows a \ntypical example of the bed-forms, with associated plots of the ripple slopes and the \nequivalent bed roughness. Figure 11a shows the ripple formation for waves with T=5 \n 22\n666 \n667 \n668 \n669 \n670 \n671 \n672 \n673 \n674 \n675 \n676 \n677 \n678 \n679 \n680 \n681 \n682 \n683 \n684 \n685 \n686 \n687 \n688 \n689 \n690 \n691 \n692 \n693 \n694 \n695 \n696 \n697 \n698 \ns and H=0.79 m; these inputs are very comparable with the case shown in Figure 6a \nfor the medium sand. However, for the fine sand the ripples can be seen to be less \nwell developed and less coherent in form, with, in the case shown, \u03b7r=0.019 m, \n\u03bbr=0.27 m and \u03b7r\/ \u03bbr=0.07. This was typical of all the experiments, with \u03b7r and \u03bbr \nrespectively being in the ranges 0.01 \u2013 0.03 m and 0.15 \u2013 0.84 m and, as shown in \nFigure 11b, with  \u03b7r\/\u03bbr= 0.06-0.09. For this range of slopes no significant flow \nseparation or vortex formation is expected to occur (e.g. Sleath 1984).  Therefore, \nalthough the ripples enhanced the bed roughness somewhat, they acted on the flow \ndynamically like a plane bed. As seen in Figure 11c, the equivalent roughness of the \nbed, if based upon ks=25\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr), would be just over a quarter that of that in the \nmedium sand case, indicating that the impact of the bed on the flow is restricted to a \nregion much closer to the bed than for the medium sand.  However, the roughness of a \ndynamically plane bed is more appropriately defined simply in terms of the sediment \ngrain size, as discussed earlier with reference to Figure 10. \n \nTo assess the impact of ripples of low slope on sediment entrainment, the variation of \nthe suspended sediment with the phase of the wave and the height above the bed of \nfine sand was examined. As in the case of the medium sand, the result was \nconstructed using ensemble wave phase averaging over 200 wave cycles. An example \nof the results is shown in Figure 12 for the following wave conditions: H=0.82 m and \nT=5s. The structure of the intra-wave suspended sediments is seen to be quite \ndifferent from that shown in Figure 7; there are no significant suspension events near \nflow reversal lifting sediment well up into the water column. High concentrations are \nconfined to a relatively thin layer within a few centimetres of the bed and the variation \nin the suspended load seems to be only weakly dependent on the phase of the wave, \nwith only marginal increases in suspended concentration levels at maximum flow \nspeed. The results in Figure 12 indicate that the bed is behaving dynamically more \nlike a plane bed, rather than a bed that is inducing vortex formation and entrainment. \nTherefore, the lack of a constant sediment diffusivity region in the fine sand case is \nnot surprising, since the conditions for vortex entrainment were not present and it is \nthe formation of vortices which are considered to be the underlying process leading to \nthe constant sediment diffusivity region. For the fine sand case it is considered that the \ndynamics are comparable with the classical flat bed situation and that turbulent \n 23\n699 \n700 \n701 \n702 \nprocesses dominate the near-bed sediment entrainment. In this case the turbulent \neddies are considered to grow with height above the bed (Davies and Villaret, 1997), \nleading to the linear increase in sediment diffusivity measured in this study over the \nbottom quarter of the water column.  \n 24\nV Discussion  703 \n704 \n705 \n706 \n707 \n708 \n709 \n710 \n711 \n712 \n713 \n714 \n715 \n716 \n717 \n718 \n719 \n720 \n721 \n722 \n723 \n724 \n725 \n726 \n727 \n728 \n729 \n730 \n731 \n732 \n733 \n734 \n735 \n \nThe aim of the present study was to contribute to the detailed understanding of the \nform of the sediment diffusivity profile above a rippled bed and elucidate the \nunderlying mechanisms that give rise to the \u03b5s-profile. This was stimulated by the \ncontrasting descriptions of sediment entrainment due to the processes of gradient \ndiffusion and vortex shedding, the former being associated with random turbulence \nand the latter with repeatable coherent structures. The gradient diffusion process, \nwhere the \u2018mixing length\u2019 is considered small compared with the vertical extent of the \nconcentration profile, is readily represented via the concept of a sediment diffusivity; \nin contrast, the vortex shedding process cannot be so directly associated conceptually \nwith a diffusion rate dependent upon the concentration gradient. The present work \nwas aimed at examining the relationship between the different processes and their \nwidely used representation via the formulation of a sediment diffusivity profile.   \n \nThe occurrence of vortex shedding in the oscillatory boundary layer above ripples \ndepends upon the ripple steepness and, more subtly, on the detailed shape of the ripple \ncrests.  Roughly speaking, vortex shedding is expected to occur if \u03b7r\/\u03bbr is greater than \nabout 0.12 and \u2018dynamically plane\u2019 bed conditions are expected if the steepness is less \nthan about 0.08.  In the Deltaflume experiments reported here, the ripple steepness \nabove the medium and fine sands was consistently close to 0.14 and 0.07, \nrespectively, suggesting that in the medium sand case vortex shedding was occurring \nwhile in the fine sand case it was not.  This proposition was confirmed by the intra-\nwave observations described in the previous section, and was translated into the \ncontrasting forms found for the respective diffusivity profiles, namely \u2018constant + \nlinear\u2019 for the medium sand and \u2018linear\u2019 for the fine sand.  The reason why ripples of \ndifferent steepness were generated by essentially the same wave conditions is beyond \nthe scope of the present paper. The difference between the medium and fine sand sizes \nmay have given rise, for example, to some different combination of bed load and \nsuspended load processes that promoted ripple development in the medium sand case \nand inhibited it in the fine sand case.  Probably, in the latter case, the relatively larger \namount of suspended sediment gave rise to settling patterns over the ripple surface \nthat counteracted any tendency for the ripples to grow (see O'Donoghue et al 2006 for \n 25\n736 \n737 \n738 \n739 \n740 \n741 \n742 \n743 \n744 \n745 \n746 \n747 \n748 \n749 \n750 \n751 \n752 \n753 \n754 \n755 \n756 \n757 \n758 \n759 \n760 \n761 \n762 \n763 \n764 \n765 \n766 \n767 \n768 \n769 \nmore detailed discussions). In any event, the two sand sizes highlighted in this paper \nexemplified very clearly the consequences of the ripple steepness for the mixing \nprocesses in the wave boundary layer, which form a key part of the complex \u2018triad of \ninteractions\u2019 between the oscillating flow, the bed forms and the sediment transport \nprocesses. \n \nWith regard to the modelling framework introduced in Section II and Table 1, it is \ninteresting to note that the experiments conducted here had Reynolds numbers in the \nsame approximate range; RE ~ 3.2.104-2.1.105 for the medium sand 2.8.104 - 1.4.105 \nfor the fine sand. However the relative roughness, A0\/ks, in the medium and fine sand \ncases was significantly different.  In the medium sand case, with ks=25\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr), A0\/ks \nlay in the range 1.3-3.1, while for the fine sand, with ks=2.5d50, A0\/ks lay in the range \n470 -1060.  The expected \u2018bed form characteristics\u2019 in Table 1 are necessarily well \nmatched with the respective A0\/ks values in the experiments, by the above choice of \ndynamically based roughness.  However Table 1 implies a rather oversimplified link \nbetween A0\/ks and RE, which is not borne out by the present observations, ie RE \nvalues were comparable, while ks differed by more than two orders of magnitude.  As \nexplained by Davies and Villaret (1997) the two parameters need to be treated as \nindependent of one another, in a way that depends in practice on the triad of \ninteractions referred to above.   \n \nThe relevance of achieving greater understanding of the sediment diffusivity above \nbed forms is considerable.  The prediction of the bed roughness still remains a central \nobstacle in the accurate prediction of sand transport rates.  As illustrated in the present \nstudy, misinterpretation of the type of flow and\/or misuse of the bed roughness ks can \ngive rise to completely fallacious diffusivities and, hence, inaccurately predicted \nconcentration profiles.  Here we have focussed only upon the ripple- and cycle-\naveraged concentration profile and its interpretation.  In terms of sand transport \nprediction by waves or by wave+current flows this is simply the first step, since the \nmean concentration profile can give information about only the \u2018current related\u2019 \ncomponent of the transport.  As noted by Davies and Thorne (2005) this component \nmay be only a relatively small part of the total transport comprising also the \u2018wave-\nrelated\u2019 component that depends upon intra-wave processes.  They noted further how \nintra-ripple processes must be invoked in order to understand the mechanisms giving \n 26\n770 \n771 \n772 \n773 \n774 \n775 \n776 \n777 \n778 \n779 \n780 \n781 \n782 \n783 \n784 \nrise to the observation that values of \u03b2 (=\u03b5s\/\u03bdt) are greater than unity above ripples \n(Section II).   Davies and Thorne (2005) suggested that, in some average sense above \na rippled bed, regions of high (or low) suspended concentration are correlated with \nregions of high (or low) vertical velocity in a way that is different from the correlation \nthat exists between the horizontal and vertical components of velocity field.  The \nformer correlation determines the sediment diffusivity \u03b5s while the latter correlation \ndetermines the eddy viscosity \u03bdt.  While these complex issues remain as key \nchallenges for future work, the present study is believed to have elucidated a vital part \nof the phenomenon of sediment dynamics above ripples.  The results for the sediment \ndiffusivity \u03b5s presented here provide simple, critical tests for modelling systems.  They \nalso lend strong support to research modelling approaches such as presented by \nDavies and Thorne (2005) who used a two-layer diffusivity (including a height-\nconstant near-bed layer) to represent quite successfully detailed sediment \nconcentration profiles observed above steep ripples.  \n \n 27\nV1 Conclusions 785 \n786 \n787 \n788 \n789 \n790 \n791 \n792 \n793 \n794 \n795 \n796 \n797 \n798 \n799 \n800 \n801 \n802 \n803 \n804 \n805 \n806 \n807 \n808 \n809 \n810 \n811 \n812 \n813 \n814 \n815 \n816 \n817 \n818 \n \nAcoustic measurements have been presented of sediment diffusivity profiles above \nsandy rippled beds under regular, weakly asymmetrical, waves. For the two beds \ninvestigated, comprising medium and fine sand respectively, different mean \nsuspended sediment concentration profiles were observed. For the medium sand the \nsediment diffusivity \u03b5s inferred from the concentration profiles was constant with \nheight above the bed up to a distance of approximately z\u22481.3ks.  Above this \u03b5s \nincreased linearly with height.  In order to explain the form of the diffusivity profile \nan assessment was made of the ripples on the bed and the variation of the suspended \nconcentration with the phase of the wave. In the case of the medium sand, the \nsteepness of the ripples indicated that flow separation on the lee-side of the ripple \ncrest should be occurring. This was confirmed by the intra-wave suspended sediment \nmeasurements, which yielded results consistent with vortex entrainment, with the \nmajor inputs of sediment into suspension occurring around flow reversal. The \nformation of the vortices led to a relatively constant mixing length, resulting in a \nconstant value for \u03b5s close to the bed. Above this region the vortices appeared to lose \ntheir coherence, with gradient diffusion becoming dominant, characterised by the \nmixing length scale growing and resulting in \u03b5s increasing with height above the bed. \nIn contrast, for the fine sand, the diffusivity, \u03b5s, was observed to increase linearly for \nall heights above the bed, and no \u2018\u03b5s = constant\u2019 lower layer was present. Analysis of \nthe ripples and the intra-wave suspended sediment showed no evidence of flow \nseparation or vortex formation. In this case it was concluded that the bed was \nbehaving as \u2018dynamically plane\u2019, with turbulent eddies growing in size with height \nabove the bed, leading to the observed linear form for \u03b5s. \n \nTo compare the observed profiles of sediment diffusivity with previous empirical \nresults, the formulations of Nielsen (1992), Van Rijn (1993) and the standard \n\u2018constant stress layer\u2019 expression were assessed. Nielsen\u2019s prediction, for very rough \nbeds, of a constant value of \u03b5s in the near-bed layer, was confirmed for the medium \nsand and found to have a value similar to that observed, though somewhat lower. The \nNielsen formulation was not applicable to the fine sand observations due to the \nabsence of coherent near-bed mixing processes. The Van Rijn expression for \u03b5s \ncaptured with reasonable accuracy both the constant and also the linear diffusivity \n 28\nregions for the medium sand. Applying the linear component of Van Rijn\u2019s \nformulation to the fine sand gave a result in the outer layer that was comparable with, \nthough an overestimate of, the observed diffusivity. Comparison of the conventional \nflat bed formulation,\n819 \n820 \n821 \nzu\u03b2\u03ba\u03b5 *s = , with \u03b2=1 and ks=25\u03b7r(\u03b7r\/\u03bbr) gave substantial \noverestimates for the linear component of \u03b5s for both of the sands studied. However, if \nks=2.5d50 was used in the evaluation of \u03b5s predictions were obtained which were much \nmore comparable with the observations.  It appears therefore that, in the medium sand \ncase, where steep ripples were observed, the sediment diffusivity in the outer layer, \ni.e. above the vortex layer, scales approximately on the grain size associated with an \nequivalent flat bed. For the low slope ripples in the fine sand the sediment diffusivity \nbehaved, both in form and also magnitude, as expected above a \u2018dynamically plane\u2019 \nbed.  Based on the present observations in the Deltaflume, new empirical formulae \nhave been proposed here for the sediment diffusivity above both steep and also low \nripples that may be used in the future by other workers. \n822 \n823 \n824 \n825 \n826 \n827 \n828 \n829 \n830 \n831 \n832 \n833 \n834 \n \n \n 29\nAcknowledgements 835 \n836 \n837 \n838 \n839 \n840 \n841 \n \nThe work was supported by the European Union through its Access to Large Scale \nFacilities under contract MAS3-CT97-0106 and by the Natural Environment Research \nCouncil, UK.
