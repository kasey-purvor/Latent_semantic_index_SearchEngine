These trends have a major impact on pregnancy outcomes in these women, which have\nbeen documented by several researchers. In a population based cohort study, using routinely\ncollected data, this paper examines the effect of increasing Body Mass Index (BMI) on pregnancy\noutcomes in nulliparous women delivering singleton babies.\nMethods: This was a retrospective cohort study, based on all nulliparous women delivering\nsingleton babies in Aberdeen between 1976 and 2005. Women were categorized into five groups\n\u2013 underweight (BMI < 20 Kg\/m2), normal (BMI 20 \u2013 24.9 Kg\/m2) overweight (BMI 25 \u2013 29.9 Kg\/m2),\nobese (BMI 30 \u2013 34.9 Kg\/m2) and morbidly obese (BMI > 35 Kg\/m2). Obstetric and perinatal\noutcomes were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses.\nResults: In comparison with women of BMI 20 \u2013 24.9, morbidly obese women faced the highest\nrisk of pre-eclampsia {OR 7.2 (95% CI 4.7, 11.2)} and underweight women the lowest {OR 0.6 (95%\nCI 0.5, 0.7)}. Induced labour was highest in the morbidly obese {OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.3, 2.5)} and\nlowest in underweight women {OR 0.8 (95% CI 0.8, 0.9)}. Emergency Caesarean section rates were\nhighest in the morbidly obese {OR 2.8 (95% CI 2.0, 3.9)}, and comparable in women with normal\nand low BMI. Obese women were more likely to have postpartum haemorrhage {OR 1.5 (95% CI\n1.3, 1.7)} and preterm delivery (< 33 weeks) {OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.3, 2.9)}. Birthweights less than 2,500\ng were more common in underweight women {OR 1.7 (95% OR 1.2, 2.0)}. The highest risk of birth\nweights > 4,000 g was in the morbidly obese {OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.3, 3.2)} and the lowest in\nunderweight women {OR 0.5 (95% CI 0.4, 0.6)}.\nConclusion: Increasing BMI is associated with increased incidence of pre-eclampsia, gestational\nhypertension, macrosomia, induction of labour and caesarean delivery; while underweight women\nhad better pregnancy outcomes than women with normal BMI.\nPublished: 24 July 2007\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:168 doi:10.1186\/1471-2458-7-168\nReceived: 15 March 2007\nAccepted: 24 July 2007\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/168\n\u00a9 2007 Bhattacharya et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:168 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/168Background\nThe rising rate of obesity is a major public health concern\nin the West, where 28% of pregnant women are over-\nweight and 11% are obese [1]. In the United States, the\nincidence of obesity in pregnancy varies from 18.5% to\n38.3% according to the definition used [2-5]. In the UK,\n56% of all women are over the recommended BMI, with\n33% of them classified as overweight (BMI > 25) and 23%\nobese (BMI > 30). Although the exact incidence of obesity\nin pregnant women in the UK is not known, the Confi-\ndential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health 2004 [6]\nreported that 35% of all maternal deaths occurring in the\ntriennium 2000\u20132002 were in obese women with Body\nMass Index > 30 Kg\/m2. Pregnancy complications in over-\nweight women were studied as early as 1945 [7]. Since\nthen, a number of studies have reported a clear associa-\ntion between maternal overweight and adverse obstetric\nand perinatal outcomes. Data from North America have\nbeen supported by results from Danish [8,9] and Swedish\nstudies [10,11]. In the UK, Sebire [12] studied the effects\nof maternal obesity on pregnancy outcomes in a London\ncohort of 287,213 women. Since then, similar reports\nhave been published from Wales [13] and Scotland [14].\nThe effect of maternal underweight on obstetric perform-\nance is less clear. While some researchers [4,15] have\nfound increased incidences of preterm delivery, low birth\nweight and increased perinatal loss in these women, oth-\ners [16] have reported a protective effect of maternal\nunderweight on certain pregnancy complications and\ninterventions.\nDefinitions of overweight, obesity and underweight differ\nin the different reports. In earlier research the relation-\nships between maternal height and weight with pregnancy\ncomplications were extensively explored, but in recent\ntimes, Body Mass Index (BMI) is widely accepted as a bet-\nter measure of over or underweight. More recently, the\nwaist-hip ratio has been used to study the effects of obes-\nity on pregnancy, but data relating to this parameter are\nseldom available. Despite the plethora of publications on\nobesity and obstetric outcomes, population based studies\nin the UK reporting on the effect of extremes of Body Mass\nIndex (high as well as low BMI) on pregnancy outcomes\nare relatively few.\nThe Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank\n(AMND) has recorded information on all pregnancy\nrelated events occurring in Aberdeen city and district since\n1950, and currently contains over 200,000 such records.\nThe height and weight of women as well as the gestational\nweeks at the first antenatal visit have been systematically\nlogged, thus offering a unique opportunity to study the\neffect of Body Mass Index (BMI) on pregnancy outcomes.\nThe aim of this study was to examine the association\nbetween Body Mass Index (BMI) and obstetric and perina-\ntal outcomes in primigravid women delivering singleton\nbabies.\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cohort study using data from the\nAberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank (AMND).\nEthical approval was granted by the North of Scotland\nResearch Ethics Committee  for all observational studies\nusing routinely collected anonymised data from the\nAMND, provided permission was granted by the Steering\nCommittee (Caldicott guardians) of the AMND. After\nobtaining permission from the Caldicott guardians, data\nwere extracted from the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal\nDatabank on all primigravid women delivering singleton\nbabies after 24 weeks of gestation in Aberdeen city and\ndistrict between 1976 and 2005. Women who booked\nafter 16 weeks were excluded. In the dataset, 7.2% of the\nwomen did not have either their height or weight or both\nrecorded and were excluded from the analysis. Missing\ndata on outcome variables varied from 1.2 \u2013 2.8%. These\nwomen were also excluded. Missing outcome data were\ndistributed evenly among the various BMI categories. All\nvariables recorded in the AMND are coded using the ICD-\n9 codes and several consistency checks are in place to\nensure data quality. Opportunistic checks carried out in\nthe past using surveys and linkages with larger databases\nhave shown the records to be 85 to 90% complete [17].\nSociodemographic variables extracted included age at\ndelivery, height and weight measured and recorded at\nantenatal booking visit, husband or partner's social class\n(recorded according to the Register General's classifica-\ntion), smoking, marital status and pre-existing Type I dia-\nbetes mellitus. Body Mass Index was calculated using the\nformula weight\/height2. The women were then catego-\nrised into five groups according to their BMI as follows\nafter Abrams [18].\nUnderweight: less than or equal to a BMI of 19.9 Kg\/m2\nNormal: BMI of 20 \u2013 24.9 Kg\/m2\nOverweight: BMI of 25 \u2013 29.9 Kg\/m2\nObese: BMI of 30 \u2013 34.9 Kg\/m2\nMorbidly obese: BMI greater than 35 Kg\/m2\nThe group with BMI in the normal range (20 \u2013 24.9 Kg\/\nm2) was used as the reference or comparison group for the\nanalysis.\nObstetric outcomes included the following: pre-eclamp-\nsia, gestational hypertension and antepartum haemor-Page 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:168 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/168rhage due to placenta praevia or abruptio placentae, type\nof labour (ie spontaneous or induced), the type of deliv-\nery (ie spontaneous vaginal, instrumental or Caesarean\nsection), preterm delivery (37 weeks and 34 weeks). Peri-\nnatal outcomes included stillbirth rate and birthweight.\nThe total number of Caesarean sections and the number\nof elective sections were recorded in the AMND \u2013 the\nnumber of emergency sections was calculated by subtract-\ning the second from the first number. Gestational age was\nrecorded according to the last menstrual period through-\nout the database and was confirmed by ultrasound ever\nsince it became available from 1986 onwards. In case of\ndiscrepancy, the ultrasound date was taken as the actual\ngestational age.\nStatistical analysis was conducted using Statistical Package\nfor Social Scientists (SPSS version 14). The anonymised\ndataset was extracted by AMND staff and given to named\nresearchers who conducted the analysis. Univariate analy-\nsis was done using ANOVA or Mann-Whitney test for con-\ntinuous variables and chi-square test for categorical\nvariables. A P-value of less than 0.05 was regarded as sta-\ntistically significant. Potential confounders were adjusted\nfor using logistic regression. The risks of obstetric compli-\ncations were presented as crude and adjusted Odds Ratios\nwith 95% confidence intervals.\nResults\nA total of 24,241 women were included in the study. Of\nthese, 2,842 (11.7%) were underweight, 14,076 (58.1%)\nhad normal BMI, 5,308 (21.9%) were overweight, 1,858\n(7.7%) were obese and 157(0.6%) were morbidly obese.\nFigure 1 shows the increasing trends in the prevalence of\nobesity in the study population over time.\nA comparison of the sociodemographic characteristics of\nthe women in the five BMI categories is presented in Table\n1. Women in the underweight category were significantly\nyounger (mean age 24.8, SD 5.2) while those in the mor-\nbidly obese group were significantly older (mean age\n28.3, SD 5.3) than those with normal BMI (mean age\n26.4, SD 5.2). The mean ages of overweight and obese\nwomen were comparable with women with normal BMI.\nAs we included all women who had booked at the Ante-\nnatal Clinic up to 16 weeks of gestation, we compared the\ntime of booking and found no differences among the dif-\nferent BMI categories. Fewer women were married or\ncohabiting in the underweight {2201 (77.4%)} and mor-\nbidly obese {125 (79.6%)} groups in comparison with\nwomen with normal BMI {11848 (84.2%)}. Fewer\nwomen in the abnormal BMI categories were from higher\nsocioeconomic groups (as indicated by their partner's\nsocial class I\/II) in comparison with women with normal\nBMI {3771 (26.8%)}. This difference in social class was\nmore marked in the groups of obese {358 (19.3%)} and\nmorbidly obese {24 (15.3%)} women. The prevalence of\nType I diabetes was higher in the morbidly obese group {3\n(1.9%)} as compared to the normal group {27 (0.2%)}.\nSmoking was significantly more common in the under-\nweight group.\nTable 2 shows the incidence of complications of preg-\nnancy, labour and delivery in women in the five BMI cat-\negories, while Table 3 presents the risk of each\ncomplication or intervention in the abnormal BMI catego-\nries in comparison with the normal. Both pre-eclampsia\nand gestational hypertension increased linearly with\nincreasing BMI, resulting in an adjusted Odds Ratio of 7.2\n(95% CI 4.7, 11.2) for pre-eclampsia and 3.1 (95% CI 2.0,\n4.3) for gestational hypertension in the morbidly obese\ncategory when compared to those of normal BMI. Being\nunderweight seemed to have a protective effect on the\ndevelopment of pregnancy induced hypertension \u2013\nadjusted OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.5, 0.7) for pre-eclampsia and\n0.7 (95% CI 0.6, 0.8) for gestational hypertension. A sim-\nilar relationship was observed with regard to placental\nabruption, but as the numbers were small, the Odds\nRatios had overlapping confidence intervals. The inci-\ndence of placenta praevia was not significantly different in\nthe different BMI categories, with the highest proportion\noccurring in underweight women {10 (0.4%) vs 25\n(0.2%) in the normal BMI group}.\nThe frequency of induced labour increased with rising\nBMI; the risk being lowest in underweight women {OR\n0.8 (95% CI 0.8, 0.9)} and highest in the morbidly obese\n{OR of 1.8 (95% CI 1.3, 2.5)}. Both elective and emer-\ngency caesarean sections were more common in the mor-\nbidly obese group, but only emergency caesarean section\nrates were significantly different in the other BMI catego-\nries. In contrast to women with normal BMI, women who\nwere morbidly obese had a 3 times (95% CI 1.7, 6.1)\nhigher risk of having an elective caesarean section, and 2.8\ntimes (95% CI 2.0, 3.9) higher risk of an emergency cae-\nsarean section. The adjusted Odds Ratios for emergency\ncaesarean section increased with increasing BMI, again\nwith a protective effect seen in underweight women {OR\n0.7 (95% CI 0.6,0.8)}.\nThe risk of postpartum haemorrhage remained statisti-\ncally significant only in obese women, although mean\nblood loss following delivery showed a linear increase\nwith increasing BMI.\nAfter adjusting for confounders, the odds of having a pre-\nterm delivery, ie a delivery before 37 completed weeks\nwere similar in the different groups. However, obese\nwomen faced an increased risk of delivery before 33 com-\npleted weeks of gestation {OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.3, 2.9)}.\nPost term delivery, ie delivery after 41 completed weeks ofPage 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:168 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/168gestation was similar in the different BMI categories after\nadjusting for confounders. Among the women who deliv-\nered before 37 weeks risk of spontaneous preterm birth\nwas increased in the underweight {adjusted OR 1.4 (95%\nCI 1.1, 1.9)} and the morbidly obese groups {adjusted\nOR 1.2 (95% CI 1.1, 2.8)}.\nStillbirth rates were significantly higher in the obese {35\n(1.9%)} and morbidly obese {4 (2.5%)} groups as\nopposed to 131 (0.9%) in the normal BMI group. But this\ndifference did not remain statistically significant in the\nmorbidly obese group after adjusting for confounders.\nAlthough low birth weight (birth weight less than 2,500\ng) was more common at the two extreme ends of the BMI\ncategories, this remained significant after adjusting for\nconfounders, only in underweight women who had an\nOdds Ratio 1.7 (95% CI 1.2, 2.0) compared to normal.\nMacrosomia (birthweight > 400 g) was more common in\nthe obese and morbidly obese groups with Odds Ratios of\n1.9 (95% CI 1.6, 2.2) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.3, 3.2) respec-\ntively, compared to the normal BMI group.\nDiscussion\nThis study adds to the increasing body of evidence which\nsuggests that obesity, measured by BMI, predisposes\nwomen to complicated pregnancies and increased obstet-\nric interventions. We found a linear relationship between\nincreasing body mass index and the risk of developing\npre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, induction of\nlabour and emergency caesarean section. Conversely, low\nBMI had a protective effect on some obstetric complica-\ntions.\nPrevious research has found a strong association between\nincreasing BMI and pregnancy induced hypertension. A\nmeta-analysis of the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with\nmaternal BMI [19] showed that the risk of pre-eclampsia\ndoubled with each 5 to 7 Kg\/m2 increase in prepregnancy\nBMI. We found a 3 times higher risk of pre-eclampsia in\nobese (BMI 30 to 39.9 Kg\/m2) and a 7 times higher risk in\nmorbidly obese (BMI > 40 Kg\/m2) primigravid women.\nWe also found a significantly lower risk of pre-eclampsia\nin underweight women {OR 0.6 (95% CI 0.5 \u2013 0.7)}, a\nfinding corroborated by Sebire et al [16].\nOur results agree with earlier reports which have shown\nan association between increasing BMI and interventions\nlike induced labour [10,13,20] and caesarean delivery\n[8,10,14,23]. Some previous work has also demonstrated\na strong link between postpartum blood loss and BMI.\nAlthough we found a linear increase in mean postpartum\nblood loss with increasing BMI, the risk of postpartum\nhaemorrhage, defined as blood loss of more than 500 ml\nfor vaginal delivery and 1000 ml for caesarean delivery,\nwas significantly higher only in the obese category. Other\nstudies have reported conflicting results. While Sebire et al\n[12] observed a 70% increase in postpartum haemor-\nrhage, Bianco et al [22] found no such difference in the\nTable 1: Sociodemographic characteristics of women in the different BMI groups\nCharacteristics Underweight\nBMI < 20\nn = 2842\nNormal\nBMI = 20\u201324.9\nn = 14076\nOverweight\nBMI = 25\u201329.9\nn = 5308\nObese\nBMI = 30\u201334.9\nn = 1858\nMorbidly Obese\nBMI > 35\nn = 157\nAge at delivery (years) 24.8 (5.2)* 26.4(5.2) 26.8(5.2) 26.8(5.1) 28.3(5.3)*\nHeight (cm) 163.0(6.5) 162.5(6.3) 162.2(6.4) 162.2(6.4) 162.4(6.0)\nWeight (Kg) 50.1(4.6) 59.2(5.7) 70.9(6.7) 87.3(9.5) 114.1(11.2)\nBMI (Kg\/m2) 18.8 (0.9) 22.4(1.3) 26.9(1.4) 33.2(2.5) 43.3(3.7)\nBooking week 10.7(2.6) 10.8(2.6) 10.6(2.7) 10.2(2.7) 9.7(2.8)\nMarried or cohabiting 2201(77.4%)* 11848(84.2%) 4449(83.8%) 1522(81.9%) 125(79.6%)*\nHusband\/partner's social class I\/II 662(23.3%)* 3771(26.8%) 1227(23.1%)* 358(19.3%)* 24(15.3%)*\nSmoking 1208(42.5%)* 4832(34.3%) 1691(31.9%)* 568(30.6%)* 32(20.4%)*\nType I Diabetes 0(0%) 27(0.2%) 40(0.8%)* 5 (0.3%) 3(1.9%)*\nValues expressed as mean (SD) median (IQR) or number (per cent)\n* P value less than 0.05\nTrends in mean BMI, Aberdeen city & district 1976\u20132005Figure 1\nTrends in mean BMI, Aberdeen city & district 1976\u20132005.\nSecular trends of mean BMI in pregnant nulliparous women\n21.5\n22\n22.5\n23\n23.5\n24\n24.5\n25\n25.5\n 1976  \n1978\n 1981  \n1983\n 1985 1987  \n1989\n1991  \n1993\n 1995  \n1997\n1999  \n2001\n2003 2005\nyear of delivery\nM\nea\nn\n B\no\nd\ny \nM\nas\ns \nIn\nd\nexPage 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:168 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/168incidence. As measurement of blood loss is subjective,\nand the definition of postpartum haemorrhage variable, it\nis difficult to make comparisons across studies. Intui-\ntively, it appears that women with higher body mass index\nshould bleed more, but this is at least in part due to the\nincreased incidence of induced labour and operative\ndeliveries in these women.\nIn contrast to the majority of studies in the literature\n[21,16] our adjusted data failed to show any differences in\nthe risk of preterm delivery (delivery before 37 completed\nweeks) in the different BMI categories. Cnattingius [11]\nfound no association between preterm delivery before 37\nweeks and prepregnancy weight, although the risk of very\npreterm delivery before 33 weeks was increased in over-\nweight nulliparous women. This was corroborated by our\nresults, which showed that the risk of preterm delivery\nbefore 33 weeks was higher in the obese group, but not in\nthe morbidly obese. On the other hand, Sebire et al [12]\nfound that delivery before 32 weeks was significantly less\nlikely in the obese.\nWith regard to intrauterine growth retardation measured\nby the adjusted birth weight, we found a strong associa-\ntion with maternal BMI. While the risk of low birth weight\n(birth weight less than 2,500 g) was higher in under-\nweight women, macrosomia was much more common in\nthe obese and morbidly obese groups. Several studies\ninvestigating the relationship of maternal obesity with\nfetal growth have shown that obese women have an 18 \u2013\n26% increased chance of delivering large for date infants,\neven after controlling for maternal diabetes [12,22-24].\nYu et al [25] suggest that the rapid fetal growth induced by\nmaternal hyperinsulinaemia coupled with placental\ninsufficiency may result in the antepartum demise of the\nfetus in obese pregnant women. Indeed this hypothesis\nhas been corroborated by several epidemiological studies\n[9,10]. This study found an increased risk of stillbirth in\nobese, but not morbidly obese women. In reality, there\nwere too few women in the morbidly obese group to com-\nment on this group's association with a rare outcome like\nstillbirth.\nApart from the slightly increased risk of having a baby\nwith low birthweight, the mothers with BMI < 20\nappeared to be at a lower risk of developing any other\npregnancy or labour complications compared even to\nwomen with BMI in the normal range \u2013 a finding corrob-\norated by Sebire et al [16]. Several complications like post-\npartum haemorrhage, preterm delivery and macrosomia\nwere found to increase linearly with rising BMI, but no\nlonger remained statistically significant in the morbidly\nobese women after adjusting for confounders. This can be\npartially explained by the smaller sample size of morbidly\nobese women and partially by the overwhelming effect of\npre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension and interven-\ntions during labour and delivery in these women.\nTable 2: Pregnancy, labour and delivery characteristics of women in each BMI group\nCharacteristics Underweight\nBMI < 20\nn = 2842\nNormal\nBMI = 20\u201324.9\nn = 14076\nOverweight\nBMI = 25\u201329.9\nn = 5308\nObese\nBMI = 30\u201334.9\nn = 1858\nMorbidly Obese\nBMI > 35\nn = 157\nPre-eclampsia* 82(3.3%) 572(5.0%) 313(8.1%) 181(14.7%) 29(28.2%)\nGestational hypertension* 374(13.6%) 2662(19.7%) 1422(28.5%) 624(37.2%) 54(42.2%)\nAbruptio placentae 12(0.4%) 83(0.6%) 31(0.6%) 13(0.7%) 3(1.9%)*\nPlacenta praevia 10(0.4%) 25(0.2%) 11(0.2%) 3(0.2%) 0(0%)\nInduced labour* 683(24.0%) 3832(27.2%) 1771(33.4%) 796(42.8%) 77(49.0%)\nInstrumental delivery 773(27.2%) 4040(28.7%) 1499(28.2%) 465(25.0%) 38(24.2%)\nTotal C-Section* 320(11.3%) 2305(16.4%) 1279(24.1%) 573(30.8%) 67(42.7%)\nElective C-section 73(2.6%) 487(3.5%) 221(4.2%) 88(4.7%)* 16(10.2%)*\nEmergency CS* 247(8.7%) 1818(12.9%) 1058(19.9%) 488(26.3%) 51(32.5%)\nMean blood loss (mls)* 254.5 (6.9) 290.4 (5.7) 333.6(8.5) 400.5(7.2) 456.4(25.7)\nPostpartum haemorrhage* 192(6.8%) 1356(9.5%) 708(13.3%) 369(19.9%) 37(23.6%)\nPreterm delivery (< 37 weeks) 345(12.1%)* 1537(10.9%) 573(10.8%) 243(13.1%)* 32(20.4%)*\nPreterm delivery (< 33 weeks) 58(2.0%) 331(2.4%) 122(2.3%) 77(4.1%)* 10(6.4%)*\nSpontaneous preterm(< 37 wks) 244(8.5%)* 964(6.8%) 325(6.1%) 124(6.6%) 12(7.6%)*\nPost term delivery (> 41 weeks) 108(3.8%)* 773(5.5%) 350 (6.6%)* 136(7.3%)* 7(4.5%)\nStillbirth 22(0.8%) 131(0.9%) 57(1.1%) 35(1.9%)* 4(2.5%)*\nBirth weight < 2500 g 269(9.5%)* 980(7.0%) 327(6.2%) 142(7.6%) 19(12.1%)*\nBirth weight > 4000 g* 100(3.5%) 1072(7.6%) 564(10.6%) 255(13.7%) 25(15.9%)\nValues expressed as number (per cent) or mean (Std. dev.)\n*P value less than 0.05Page 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:168 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/168The growing interest in obesity in pregnancy has\nprompted at least two good quality reviews [25,26] and\nseveral primary studies. Most studies have used a retro-\nspective cohort design using data from routinely collected\nhospital databases [12,21] or trial data (Weiss \u2013 FASTER\ntrial) [24]. In neither case do the data reflect population\ntrends. As the AMND records and stores information on\nall pregnancy events in a geographically defined area, our\ndata set is truly population based. We have restricted our\ndata between 1976 and 2005, as the principal aim of this\nstudy was to examine pregnancy outcomes while mini-\nmising the effects of changes in clinical practice over time.\nNevertheless, even this limited dataset, shows a rising\nincidence of obese women booking for antenatal care.\nDespite restricting this study to nulliparous women deliv-\nering singleton babies we achieved a sample size of\n24,241 women, which to our knowledge makes it one of\nthe largest studies of this kind. In contast with most retro-\nspective studies, all pregnancy events were concurrently\nrecorded by AMND staff thereby limiting recall bias. The\nheight and weight recorded at the booking antenatal visit\nwere coded using stringent criteria and standard defini-\ntions and are subject to validity and consistency checks,\nmaking the data completely reliable. More information\nabout coding and quality of the dataset is available at the\nAMND website [27].\nThis study, like any other observational study of its kind\nsuffers from several limitations. Firstly, the ideal time to\nrecord the baseline height and weight of a pregnant\nwoman is before she has started gaining weight due to ges-\ntation. As this is seldom available on a routine database,\nmost researchers have relied on the woman's recall of her\npre-pregnancy height and weight, the reliability and\nstandardisation of which is very doubtful [28]. In our\nstudy we have relied on height and weight recorded in\nearly pregnancy, before any real impact of gestational\nweight gain. Still, values recorded in early pregnancy\nremain an approximation of the pre-pregnancy weight,\nand therefore subject to bias. Also, exclusion of all women\nwho booked after 16 weeks of gestation could have\nresulted in selection bias, overweight or underweight\nwomen being systematically excluded from the dataset.\nHowever, we found an even distribution of the week of\nTable 3: Crude and adjusted risks of obstetric complications in the different BMI groups compared to normal (OR 1)\nCharacteristics OR (95% CI) Underweight\nBMI < 20\nn = 2842\nOverweight\nBM I= 25\u201329.9\nn = 5308\nObese\nBMI = 30\u201334.9\nn = 1858\nMorbidly Obese\nBMI > 35\nn = 157\nPre-eclampsia* Crude 0.7(0.5\u20130.8) 1.7(1.4\u20131.9) 3.3(2.7\u20133.9) 7.4(4.8\u201311.5)\nAdjusted 0.6(0.5\u20130.7) 1.6(1.2\u20131.8) 3.1(2.8\u20133.5) 7.2(4.7\u201311.2)\nGestational hypertension* Crude 0.6(0.5\u20130.7) 1.6(1.5\u20131.8) 2.4(2.2\u20132.7) 3.0(2.1\u20134.2)\nAdjusted 07(0.6\u20130.8) 1.5(1.4\u20131.7) 2.2(2.1\u20132.6) 3.1(2.0\u20134.3)\nInduced labour* Crude 0.8(0.7\u20130.9) 1.3(1.2\u20131.4) 2.0(1.8\u20132.2) 2.6(1.9\u20133.5)\nAdjusted 0.8(0.8\u20130.9) 1.3(1.2\u20131.4) 1.8(1.6\u20132.0) 1.8(1.3\u20132.5)\nElective C-section Crude 0.7(0.6\u20130.9)* 1.2(1.0\u20131.4) 1.4(1.1\u20131.8)* 3.2(1.9\u20135.3)*\nAdjusted 0.8(0.6\u20131.0) 1.1(0.9\u20131.3) 1.4(1.0\u20131.8) 3.1(1.7\u20136.1)*\nEmergency CS Crude 0.9(0.9\u20131.0) 1.7(1.5\u20131.8)* 2.4(2.1\u20132.7)* 3.2(2.3\u20134.5)*\nAdjusted 0.9(0.8\u20131.1) 1.5(1.3\u20131.6)* 2.0(1.8\u20132.3)* 2.8(2.0\u20133.9)*\nPostpartum hge Crude 0.7(0.6\u20130.8)* 1.4(1.3\u20131.6)* 2.3(2.1\u20132.6)* 2.9(2.0\u20134.2)*\nAdjusted 0.8(0.7\u20131.0) 1.1(1.0\u20131.2) 1.5(1.3\u20131.7)* 1.3(0.8\u20131.9)\nPreterm delivery (< 37 weeks) Crude 1.1(0.9\u20131.3) 1.0(0.9\u20131.1) 1.2(1.1\u20131.4)* 2.1(1.4\u20133.1)*\nAdjusted 1.0(0.9\u20131.3) 1.0(0.9\u20131.1) 1.2(1.0\u20131.4) 1.6(1.0\u20132.7)\nPreterm delivery (< 33 weeks) Crude 0.9(0.7\u20131.2) 1.0(0.8\u20131.2) 1.8(1.4\u20132.3)* 2.8(1.4\u20135.4)*\nAdjusted 0.9(0.7\u20131.1) 1.0(0.8\u20131.1) 2.0(1.3\u20132.9)* 2.0(0.8\u20134.9)\nSpont.

While most reports define obesity\nas an increased body mass index of greater than or equal\nto 30 Kg\/m2 (IOM), others have defined it as increased\nwaist circumference, increased waist \u2013 hip ratio or body\nweight of more than 90 Kg. This makes comparison of\nstudies difficult and may have implications in the man-\nagement of normal pregnancy, as in the United States, rec-\nommended gestational weight gain is dependent on\nwomen's prepregnancy BMI categories [30]. Moreover, in\nmost clinics, pre-pregnancy BMI is not recorded routinely,\nthereby making extrapolation of booking weight or\nwomen's recall of prepregnancy weight unreliable.\nKrishnamoorthy et al [29] suggest that all pregnancies in\nobese women be acknowledged as high risk and managed\naccording to strict guidelines. Management should\ninclude prepregnancy counselling to reduce weight;\nshared antenatal care and appropriate management of\ncomplications. The evidence for obesity as an important\ncomplication in pregnancy is mounting; it is time to\ninform practice based on this evidence.\nConclusion\nMaternal BMI shows strong associations with pregnancy\ncomplications and outcomes. Obesity is associated with\nincreased incidence of pre-eclampsia, gestational hyper-\ntension, macrosomia, stillbirth, induction of labour and\ncaesarean delivery; while underweight women appear to\nhave better pregnancy outcomes than even women with\nBMI within the normal range.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nSB\u00a5 was responsible for designing the study, analysing the\ndata and writing the first and final drafts. DC and WAL\nconceived of the original research idea and were responsi-\nble for facilitating data extraction from the Aberdeen\nMaternity and Neonatal Databank. SB had input into\ndesign of the study, analysis plan, interpretation of the\nresults and editing the first draft. All four authors contrib-\nuted to the writing of the final draft.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by a project grant from the Chief Scientist's \nOffice in Scotland. The authors would like to thank Mrs. Linda Murdoch for \nextracting the data from the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank.\nReferences\n1.
