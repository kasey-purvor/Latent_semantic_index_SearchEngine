Sheeba, Aneta Stefanovska, and Peter V. E. McClintock\nDepartment of Physics, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YB, United Kingdom\nABSTRACT There is growing evidence in favor of the temporal-coding hypothesis that temporal correlation of neuronal\ndischarges may serve to bind distributed neuronal activity into unique representations and, in particular, that u (3.5\u20137.5 Hz) and\nd (0.5 , 3.5 Hz) oscillations facilitate information coding. The u- and d-rhythms are shown to be involved in various sleep\nstages, and during anesthesia, they undergo changes with the depth of anesthesia. We introduce a thalamocortical model of\ninteracting neuronal ensembles to describe phase relationships between u- and d-oscillations, especially during deep and light\nanesthesia. Asymmetric and long-range interactions among the thalamocortical neuronal oscillators are taken into account. The\nmodel results are compared with experimental observations. The d- and u-activities are found to be separately generated and\nare governed by the thalamus and cortex, respectively. Changes in the degree of intraensemble and interensemble synchrony\nimply that the neuronal ensembles inhibit information coding during deep anesthesia and facilitate it during light anesthesia.\nINTRODUCTION\nNeuronal communication and synchronization are crucially\nimportant features of the cooperative interaction among neu-\nronal ensembles, endowing the brain with the marvelous ca-\npability known as cognition. The timescales of human motor\nand cognitive events are comparable to those of the electro-\nencephalographic (EEG) field dynamics arising from syn-\nchronous activity, observable fromwithin or outside the brain\n(1). Since EEG signals correspond to the averaged activity of\nlarge cell populations, their fluctuations can support cognitive\nactivity only if they are sufficiently synchronized: effective\ncommunication of neuronal ensembles can be achieved only\nif they are oscillating in a synchronized manner. Such be-\nhavior tags those neurons to represent particular cognitive\ntasks, e.g., in relation to a perceptual object (2).\nIn this article, we present a model of interacting thalamo-\ncortical neuronal ensembles in an attempt to account for the\nbehavior of d- and u-waves during anesthesia. Our model is\nmotivated by an attempt to tackle the problem of anesthetic\nawareness, to provide the basic understanding needed to\nprevent people from inadvertently awakening during surgery.\nWe therefore focus on ways to identify and characterize the\nstates of deep and light anesthesia. Our starting point model is\nthe experimental observation that both the cardiorespiratory\nand respiratory d-interactions change with the depth of an-\nesthesia in rats (3,4) after the administration of a single bolus\nof ketamine-xylazine. During the ensuing deep phase of an-\nesthesia (;45 min), the amplitude of d-waves is strongly\npronounced. As the subsequent light phase of anesthesia\n(;25 min) is entered, the d-waves disappear and the ampli-\ntude of u-waves increases. We use the phase dynamics ap-\nproach to propose a model that incorporates regional\nensembles of neurons that are connected both among and\nbetween themselves.\nFurther, we investigate the role played by the neuronal\nensembles in temporal coding during deep and light anes-\nthesia from the model results. Neuronal synchrony is often\nassociated with an oscillatory pattern of signals (oscillation-\nbased synchrony). The frequencies of such signals generally\ncover a broad range and, more importantly, exhibit a marked\nstate dependence. In other words, synchrony and temporal\ncoding of information in selective frequency bands are two\ndifferent sides of the same coin. We use this idea and es-\ntablish the link between the conditions under which temporal\ncoding is believed to occur (synchrony) and the level of\narousal of the brain.\nPhysiological background\nDuring periods of slow wave sleep\/anesthesia, widespread\nsynchronized oscillations occur throughout the thalamus and\nthe cortex. The slow oscillations (,1 Hz) that occur during\nnatural sleep and ketamine-xylazine anesthesia are an emer-\ngent network property of neocortical neurons. Those involved\nare the thalamocortical relay (TC) and thalamic reticular en-\nsemble (RE) neurons (5). The clock-like d (1\u20134 Hz) are pro-\nduced in the thalamus and are strongly synchronized by the RE\nand the thalamocortical volleys (6). A small proportion of the\nTC neurons also displays slow and d-oscillations (5). Thus the\nhigh-amplitude, low-frequency d- and slow oscillations are\nfound to be associated with highly coherent activities of the\ncortical, RE, and TC neurons.

The RE\nneurons wrap most of the dorsal and ventral aspects of thal-\namus (8) and act as a bridge between the TC neurons and the\nthalamic neurons. The dense axons of the RE neurons in-\nnervate the TC neurons (9). The corticothalamic fibers (in-\ndicated by the downward arrow) also leave collaterals within\nthe RE nucleus and dorsal thalamus. The RE neurons thus\nform a network that surrounds the thalamus. It receives a\ncopy of nearly all thalamocortical and corticothalamic ac-\ntivity, and projects connections solely to neurons in the TC\nregion (7). In turn, the axons of the TC neurons give rise to\ncollaterals in the RE nucleus while the parent axon passes\nthrough the cerebral cortex (10).\nTHE MODEL\nBased on the physiological phenomena that take place during\nanesthesia, as well as on anatomy, the model system con-\nsidered is shown schematically in Fig. 1 (right). The oscil-\nlators in the three ensembles, namely the cortical, the thalamic\nreticular, and the thalamocortical relay neurons, have different\nmean natural frequencies and their interactions are character-\nized by intrapopulation and interpopulation coupling param-\neters.\nEach neuron in the ensembles is considered as an oscillator\nwhose membrane potential is the oscillating variable. The\ncouplings represent the synaptic connections between them.\nWe reduce the system to a phase model, one of the simplest\nyet accurate models for weakly coupled nonlinear oscillators,\nwith the coupling being introduced through the phases. In\ndoing so, we make use of the fact that there exists a degree of\ncoherence between the membrane potential oscillations and\nthe action potential firings. Although they are not equivalent,\nthe action potentials are triggered at a certain phase of the\nmembrane potential oscillations.

The results are normalized to \u2018\u2018real time\u2019\u2019 and the\nsystem is simulated for the equivalent of 60 min with N \u00bc\n10,000. We will refer to synchrony within an ensemble as\nintraensemble synchrony, and that between ensembles as\ninterensemble synchrony. The amount of intraensemble syn-\nchrony is measured by the mean field parameters: r(1,2,3) \u00bc 0\nimplies that there is no synchrony in the corresponding en-\nsemble, r(1,2,3) \u00bc 1 indicates complete synchrony, and 0 ,\nr(1,2,3) , 1 corresponds to partial synchrony. The greater the\nvalue of r(1,2,3), the more oscillators are oscillating in syn-\nchrony (11,12). On the other hand, interensemble synchrony\noccurs when oscillators from two different ensembles entrain\nto a frequency\/phase window. In general, interensemble syn-\nchrony can be quantified by a constant difference in the mean\nphases c(1,2,3). However, this measurement will be valid only\nif both the ensembles are completely locked to each other. For\npartial synchrony, the difference in the mean phase will be\noscillating, showing no synchrony. Hence we identify inter-\nensemble synchrony by looking at the time evolution of the\nensemble-averaged frequencies. Also, for increasing inter-\nensemble coupling parameters, a decrease in r(1,2,3) is a sig-\nnature of interensemble synchrony (13).\nThe interensemble and intraensemble coupling parameters\nare swept in time to mimic the effect of decreasing concen-\ntration of anesthetic agent. This corresponds to the ability of\nanesthetics to affect thalamocortical signaling, as is well\nrecognized from in vivo electrophysiological work on ani-\nmals (14). The greater the concentration of anesthetic, the\nweaker is the interaction among the neurons. Passage from\nthe deeper to lighter anesthetic phases corresponds to a de-\ncrease in the concentration of the anesthetic agent. As a first-\norder approximation, we assume this to occur linearly. In the\nmodel, therefore, we increase the coupling parameters line-\narly with time. The starting values are as given in the legend\nof Fig. 2. We used a step-size of 0.000027 and increased the\ncoupling values linearly with time, the number of iterations\ntotaling 36,000. Hence, at the end of the simulation, each\ncoupling parameter had increased by 0.972 from its starting\nvalue. We introduce asymmetry in the model by a phase shift\n0 # a , p\/2.

The cortical neurons are\nendowed with intrinsic properties that could be reflected in\nfield potential recordings as d-activities. The frequencies of\nthese faster oscillations evolve around the upper limit of the\nd-band (mainly 3\u20134 Hz) (15\u201317). The clocklike d-oscilla-\ntions (1\u20134 Hz) are mainly produced in the RE neurons (5).\nIndividual TC neurons are capable of producing Ca21 spikes\nand associated action potentials at frequencies of 0.5\u20134 Hz\n(6).\nRESULTS\nThe time evolution of the mean frequency of each ensemble\nis plotted in Fig. 2 (right). They represent the time evolutions\nof the ensemble-averaged frequencies; that is, the frequencies\nare averaged over all the neurons in each ensemble, and the\nresulting mean value is plotted against time for each en-\nsemble. For comparison, the experimental d- and u-fre-\nquencies, obtained by wavelet analysis of the EEG signals\nfrom anesthetized rats (3), are plotted in Fig.2 (left). In the\n2724 Sheeba et al.\nBiophysical Journal 95(6) 2722\u20132727\nlatter experiments, the d-activity was found initially to be of\nhigher amplitude compared to that of the u-waves. In par-\nticular, during the deep phase of anesthesia (up to;45 min),\nthere occurs a strong, high amplitude d-activity that greatly\ndiminishes on entry to the light phase (after ;45 min). The\nu-activity runs independently throughout the whole period of\nanesthesia, but at a much lower amplitude compared to that of\nthe d-waves. Note the differences in the amplitudes corre-\nsponding to the color codes in Fig. 2 (left), which makes the\nu-activity visible in the top panel.\nThe model results suggest that it is the TC and RE en-\nsembles that generate the d-activity during deep anesthesia.\nThis d is of high amplitude due to the strong synchrony in and\nbetween the TC and RE ensembles. Synchrony between the\nTC and RE ensembles can be easily established even with a\nsmaller value of interensemble coupling, because the fre-\nquency difference between them is relatively small. Fig. 3\nshows the time evolutions of the mean-field parameters\nr(1,2,3) of the three ensembles corresponding to the simulated\nfrequencies. During deep anesthesia, the fractions of oscil-\nlators that oscillate in synchrony in the TC and RE ensembles\nare higher than in the C ensemble. This results in a strongly\npronounced d, whereas the amplitude of u remains low due to\na very low number of oscillators oscillating in synchrony in\nthe C ensemble (see Fig. 3).\nOn the other hand, for the thalamus (TC 1 RE) to be\nsynchronized with the cortex, a relatively higher value of\ncoupling strength is required. This occurs at ;45 min, at\nwhich point the TC and RE frequencies shift to a higher value\nto join the C ensemble and produce u-activity. This is the\nreason for the sudden diminution of the d and appearance of u\nat;45 min. Of course, the exact time of occurrence depends\non the value of the coupling parameter that we choose. As a\nconsequence of the shift (interensemble synchrony), the amount\nof intraensemble synchrony is reduced in the TC and RE en-\nsembles (J. H. Sheeba, V. K. Chandrasekar, A. Stefanovska,\nand P. V. E. McClintock, unpublished data) and hence the u\nappears as a low-amplitude activity. We thus quantify the\namplitudes of the characteristic d- and u-activities by the\nmean-field parameters r(1,2,3), which reveals the amount of\nsynchrony in each ensemble and hence the amplitude of the\noscillations. The intraensemble and interensemble synchro-\nnization mechanisms discussed here are generic to systems of\ncoupled oscillator ensembles (11,12,18\u201323, and J. H. Sheeba,\nV. K. Chandrasekar, A. Stefanovska, and P. V. E.McClintock,\nunpublished data).\nPhase coding and depth of anesthesia\nThe d- and u-phases play significant roles in coding infor-\nmation when the brain is not in an aroused state, character-\nized by desynchronized EEG. The level with which the\nphases are synchronized determines the ability to code in-\nFIGURE 2 (Left) Time evolution of the characteristic EEG d- and u-frequencies during ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, analyzed by wavelet transform.\nReproduced fromMusizza et al.

However, it is the interensemble synchrony that\nplays the crucial role in temporal binding (rather than the\nintraensemble synchrony). Since synchrony is supposed to\nenhance the significance of responses of the neurons (2), it is\nobvious that synchronized discharges will have a stronger\nimpact than temporally disorganized ones (24). Thus the\nu-phase is found to play a crucial role in inhibiting infor-\nmation by being poorly synchronized in the cortex. More\nimportantly, though, the cortex and the thalamus are not in\nsynchrony with each other (see Fig. 3). Due to this, binding of\ninformation cannot be achieved, which is why consciousness\nand cognition are absent during the deep phase of anesthesia.\nThe strong d-waves keep the cortex and the thalamus out of\nphase with each other during deep anesthesia. As the anes-\nthesia lightens, however, the thalamus enters into synchrony\nwith the cortex. We postulate that this corresponds to the\nonset of awareness when information starts to be coded due\nto the emergence of interensemble synchrony, characterized\nby the u-wave (see Figs. 2 and 3).\nDISCUSSION\nThe model results indicate that the d- and the u-activities\nobserved experimentally are separate in terms of their gen-\neration and frequency. The d- and u-activities are found to\noccur mainly in 0.5\u20133.5 Hz and 3.5\u20137.5 Hz bands in agree-\nment with recent observations (3) and earlier reports (15,16).\nThe dramatic diminution of the d-amplitude and the simul-\ntaneous appearance of u-activity characterize the transition\nfrom deep to light anesthesia.\nIn the experiment (3), the amplitudes of the d- and u-waves\ndiffered by more than a factor of 10. To reveal u (which\notherwise would have been lost in the noise level of d), two\nseparate figures were therefore plotted with different ampli-\ntude scales. Our model results suggest that u-activity is present\nduring both deep and light anesthesia. However, during deep\nanesthesia, the d-activity is highly synchronized, whereas\nu-activity is poorly synchronized (see Fig. 3). The effect on\ntheir relative amplitudes is that the u-activity cannot be seen\nduring the deep anesthesia in the experiment, consistent with\nthe observations, despite its presence as revealed by the model.\nAlthough varying the coupling parameters to mimic the\neffect of decreasing concentration of the anesthetic agent\nhelps us to understand and compare the model results with\nreality, it introduces oscillations in the frequencies. As is\nevident from Fig. 2, the mean frequencies of each of the\nensembles undergo noisy oscillations, while remaining\nwithin the d\/u-bands. The effect of varying coupling pa-\nrameters affects the frequencies directly because the model\nequations are for the oscillator phases and the frequencies are\ncalculated from the phases themselves. Likewise, the oscil-\nlations seen in the order parameters (Fig. 3) are introduced\nmainly by the change in interensemble coupling parameters.\nSince the model considers only the phases, and not the\namplitudes, we are unable to make a direct comparison with\nthe experimental results. However, we make use of the theory\nof synchronization to quantify the amplitude in terms of the\namount of synchrony in each of the ensembles. That is, the\nmore the synchrony, the more oscillators are oscillating in\nphase with each other, and hence the higher the corre-\nsponding oscillation amplitude. On the other hand, the model\ndoes offer the advantage that we are able to identify those\nneuronal groups that are responsible for the generation of\nd- and u-activity during anesthesia.\nAlthough we do not challenge the importance of the mi-\ncroscopic details underlying general anesthesia and the\nHodgkin-Huxley formalisms (25), the model results support\nthe hypothesis that consideration of macroscopic dynamics\nwith asymmetry is important. We therefore suggest that\nmodels of similar kinds can be used to explain experimental\nobservations, not only in anesthesia, as here, but also in other\ncognitive and behavioral states that involve huge numbers of\nneurons functioning in groups. Detailed work has been done\nin the field of neuronal mass modeling, and a wide range of\nEEG generative models has been proposed (26\u201332). Our\nmodel is capable of generating the wide range of EEG os-\ncillatory behaviors reported earlier (33\u201337). Our findings\nidentify the link between neuronal synchrony and temporal\ncoding, especially in terms of interensemble synchrony. An\nadditional advantage of the model is that it yields insight into\nthe synchronization mechanisms underlying the d- and\nu-waves.\nCONCLUSION\nIn summary, we have introduced a model involving asym-\nmetrically interacting ensembles of C, TC, and RE neurons to\nunderstand the mechanisms underlying the generation of\nd- and u-waves during anesthesia. The model results are com-\npared with those from experiments (3). The TC and RE en-\nsembleswere found to be responsible for the generation of high\namplitude d-waves during deep anesthesia. The C ensemble is\nengaged with the u-activity. The transition from deep to light\nanesthesia is found to be marked by a frequency shift in the TC\nand RE ensembles, caused by the increase in the coupling\nstrengths. Also, the u-activity is found not to be as strongly\nsynchronized as the d-activity. The similarities and differences\nbetween the model results and the experimental results were\ndiscussed. Furthermore, the model illuminates the phenome-\nnon of temporal coding of information, in particular by the\nd- and u-frequencies. It reveals the role played by the neuronal\nphases in inhibiting information during deep anesthesia and\ncoding the sensory information during light anesthesia. Al-\nthough our main motivation for introducing the model was to\nunderstand the mechanisms giving rise to the generation of\nd- and u-waves during ketamine-xylazine anesthesia in rats\n(3,4), it can also be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved\nin the generation of brain waves for other anesthetics and also\nduring slow wave sleep. The results derived from the model\n2726 Sheeba et al.\nBiophysical Journal 95(6) 2722\u20132727\nwill have implications for the understanding of functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencelapho-\ngraphic (MEG) dynamics.\nThe studywas supported by the EuropeanCommission FP6NEST-Pathfinder\nproject BRACCIA and in part by the Slovenian Research Agency.\nREFERENCES\n1.
