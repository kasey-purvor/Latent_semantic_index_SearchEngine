It lies within a \nsmall area of marshland and is surrounded by a carr of mature trees and large bushes.  It has \nno significant surface water inflows or outflows and its residence time is thus very long.  \nScientific research has been carried out on Priest Pot for over fifty years, mainly from a \nbiological perspective.  As a result, much information on its species richness (to date around \n1000 microbial taxa have been recorded) and biochemistry has been garnered and an \nunusually high level of chemical and microbial compartmentalisation of the water column \nobserved (Finlay and Maberley, 2000).   \nPonds may be loosely defined as lentic waterbodies that are sufficiently small and \nshallow to make them qualitatively different from lakes (see also Biggs et al., 2005) and are \nvery common in both temperate and tropical environments (Oertli et al., 2005 and Talling, \n2001, respectively).  For example, in Great Britain approximately 97% \u2013 some 400,000 \u2013 of \nall standing waterbodies have surface areas of less than five hectares (Biggs et al., 2005).  \nPonds are usually highly biologically productive and support an unusually diverse variety of \nspecies in a small space (Finlay and Maberley, 2000; Williams, 2004).  Furthermore, they are \nestimated to be disappearing at a rate of several thousand per year (Williams et al., 1998).  \nKey questions in pond research reflect the importance of their contribution to biodiversity, \nand focus primarily on controls on their trophic status and species richness and the \nmechanisms which dominate their biogeochemical cycles.  The shallowness of ponds is \nimportant in that it increases the extent to which their benthic regions are affected by \natmospheric processes and air-water exchanges at the water surface (Talling, 2001).  \nHowever, when ponds have very limited surface areas, and moreover are sheltered by \n 4 \nsurrounding vegetation, they can become very strongly stratified.  This counteracts the effect \nof their shallowness, by limiting exchanges between the bottom water and the atmosphere \n(Spence et al., 2003).   \n As for Priest Pot, most studies of other ponds have been carried out from a biological \nperspective (for recent reviews see, for example, Biggs et al., 2005; Oertli et al., 2005).  This \nis not surprising, given that their primary value lies in their contribution to species richness.  \nHowever, relatively little research has been carried out into their thermal and hydrodynamic \nnature.  This is an important omission, since these physical factors are central to the \nstructuring of the water column that is the essential framework for their highly diverse \necosystems.  For example, near surface, diurnal thermoclines may trap organisms or chemical \nmatter in the highly irradiated near surface water (Xenopoulos and Schindler, 2001).  Near \nsurface heating and cooling also affects the growth of mosquito and fly larvae which live in \nthis part of the water column (Jacobs et al., 1997).  More generally, measurement of the time \nand spatial scales of turbulent mixing processes are required to determine rates of vertical \ncycling of phytoplankton and therefore quantify their irradiation (MacIntyre, 1993; Lorke, \n1998).   \nStudies have been made of thermal stratification of small, standing waterbodies, \nalthough most of this work has concerned artificial structures designed for stormwater \nretention, aquaculture etc. Jacobs et al. (1998) studied temperature variations in a pool  6m \nacross and 0.35m deep during summer.  Even in such a constrained environment they found a \nsignificant depth-dependence in the amplitude of the temperature variations within the water.  \nMore detailed work using thermal microstructure probes to identify turbulent mixing \nprocesses has been carried out on a number of small and\/or shallow natural lakes using \ntechniques developed in larger lakes and oceans (e.g., MacIntyre, 1993; Lorke, 1998).  These \nhave found different mixing processes \u2013 dominated by convective cooling and wind stress-\n 5 \ninduced shear \u2013 acting together over short time scales to mediate vertical migration of \nphytoplankton through the light attenuation curve, via both relatively large-scale coherent \nadvective motions and diffusion due to smaller scale turbulent activity. \n A priori, the physics of temperate zone ponds may appear relatively straightforward: \ndiurnal and seasonal ambient temperature variations would be expected to dominate, and give \nthe ponds a seasonal monomictic or dimictic character, on which one would expect significant \nnocturnal convective cooling and daytime surface heating patterns to be superimposed.  \nEnergetic, episodic storm events would be expected to largely overturn them.  There is, \nhowever, little detailed information on their thermal and hydrodynamic structure to either \nsupport or contradict this assumed character.  The contribution of this paper is to provide such \ninformation for Priest Pot specifically, and to interpret its more widely-relevant implications.   \nTo summarise, the specific objectives of the study were to: \n\u2022 determine the overall thermal structure of the water column; \n\u2022 determine how this varied over time scales varying from sub-daily to seasonal, and \nexplain these patterns in terms of the environmental context of the pond; \n\u2022 determine the distribution of turbulent mixing activity within the water column, \nidentify its character and infer its ecological implications. \n \nMethods \nThermal microstructure profiles of the water column were obtained from a mooring at \nthe approximate centre of Priest Pot on 14 days during July-October 2003 using a Self-\nContained Autonomous Micro-Profiler or SCAMP (see http:\/\/www.pme.com\/scamp.htm).  It \nwas deployed in ascending mode, in which the instrument fell to an operator-defined depth at \nan angle, released a weight, and then rose vertically through water thus undisturbed by its \ndescent, with a velocity of ~0.1m s\n-1\n.  Temperature was recorded at 100 Hz, giving a spatial \n 6 \nresolution of ~1mm.  Several profiles, approximately ten minutes apart, were recorded on \neach fieldwork day in order to obtain a sufficiently large dataset of turbulent parameter values \nfor analysis.  At the profiling location during the fieldwork period, the high seston \nconcentrations found within the water column strongly attenuated the light such that the \nSecchi depth was approximately 1m: significantly less than the full depth of the pond. \nIn order to characterize the general thermal structure of the water column, the \nindividual profiles from each day were Thorpe-ordered into monotonically increasing profiles \nby sorting the depth and density series individually (following Thorpe, 1977).  From these \nmonotonic profiles, the average temperature at each depth was calculated, and a mean profile \nfor the day thus calculated.  Typically, variations in temperature measurements at any given \ndepth between all the individual profiles were of the order of 0.1\u00b0C.  The overall buoyancy \nfrequency of this mean profile was then calculated as  \n \nz\ng\nN\n0 \u2206\n\u03c1\u2206\n\u03c1\n=        (1) \n \nwhere g is gravitational acceleration, \u03c10 is the mean water density, and \u2206\u03c1\/\u2206z is the gradient \nof the best fit straight line to the density profile.  To quantify the variation in stratification, the \nbuoyancy frequency was also calculated for various segments of the mean profile. \nThe individual, raw profiles were divided into segments 128 data points long \n(corresponding to approximately 13 cm of depth) in order to determine the depth variation of \nturbulence characteristics.  The turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate \u03b5 was calculated for \neach segment using Batchelor curve fitting (Dillon and Caldwell, 1980).  The root mean \nsquare and maximum Thorpe scales, LT and LTmax, were calculated (Thorpe, 1977) and taken \nto represent r.m.s. and maximum length scales of turbulent overturns in each segment \nrespectively (root mean square values being calculated from non-zero displacements values \n 7 \nonly).  The Ozmidov scale LO = ( )\n2\/13N\u03b5  (where N is the local buoyancy frequency of the \nsegment), was calculated and taken to represent the maximum scale to which turbulent eddies \nmay grow before becoming significantly constrained by buoyancy. \nThe turbulent velocity scale was calculated as ( ) 3\/1TL\u03b5u =  (following, for example, \nIvey and Imberger 1991).  This allowed calculation of the turbulent Froude and Reynolds \nnumbers, respectively TT NLuFr =  and \u03bduLRe T=  where \u03bd is the fluid viscosity.  This \nenabled the construction of hydrodynamic phase diagrams (Ivey and Imberger, 1991), which \nallowed the relative importance of viscosity and buoyancy forces in damping the turbulence to \nbe assessed.  The vertical eddy diffusivity was calculated, following Osborn (1980), as \n \n2\nf\nf\nZ\nN\n\u03b5\nR1\nR\nK\n\u2212\n=        (2) \n \nwhere Rf is the flux Richardson number.  This parameter was calculated using the method \ndetailed by Ivey and Imberger (1991), who define it as the ratio of the buoyancy flux that \noccurs due to turbulent motions to the net mechanical energy required to sustain those \nmotions, i.e. the efficiency of the turbulent motions in turning mechanical energy into \npotential energy.  KZ provides the key measure of the rate at which turbulence transfers scalar \nquantities vertically. \nMeteorological data covering a wide range of variables was provided for the period \nJanuary 2002 to May 2004 by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Lancaster, U.K.  These \ndata were taken from a meteorological buoy located less than 1 km from Priest Pot, on the \nadjacent, larger lake Esthwaite Water (surface area ~1 km\n2\n; maximum depth ~15m).  \nComparisons were made between hourly data from this buoy and those taken from a buoy \ndeployed on Priest Pot during the previous year (which was not available during the summer \n 8 \nof 2003).  Data was missing from a significant part of 2002 for the Priest Pot buoy, due to \ninstrument problems, but sufficient data was available to derive statistically significant \nrelationships.  The data show a strongly correlated linear relationship between air temperature \nvalues (r\n2\n = 0.89; n = 1689; p << 0.001) from Esthwaite and Priest Pot.  The amplitude of air \ntemperature variations was on average ~33% higher at Priest Pot than on Esthwaite (t = 9.3; \ndf = 72; p << 0.001), evidently due to the damping effect of the larger body of water at the \nlatter location.  Wind speeds at these two locations are also well correlated (r\n2\n = 0.61; n = \n4623; p << 0.001).  The sheltered nature of Priest Pot is reflected in the wind speeds there, \nwhich are typically ~75% of those measured at the Esthwaite buoy (t = 3.8; df = 4622; p << \n0.001).  The final meteorological variable used in the analyses below, downwelling short \nwave solar radiation (measured ~2m above the water surface), has not been measured at Priest \nPot, but its value is assumed to vary little over the 1 km spatial scale between the Esthwaite \nbuoy where it was measured and Priest Pot.   The period over which data was collected \ncovered a wide range of meteorological forcing conditions.  This resulted in a wide variety of \ndifferent stratification and mixing regimes being sampled.   \n \nResults \nSeasonal time scale variations in stratification \nThe seasonal variation of stratification in Priest Pot follows the classical pattern found \nin larger lakes.  Figure 1a shows the variation of the overall stratification of the water column \nN  during 2002-2004.  These data are calculated from temperature profiles recorded at \napproximately 0.25m intervals during routine fortnightly monitoring of the pond, and \nSCAMP micro-scale temperature profiles taken during the dedicated field campaign in 2003.  \nThe pond starts to stratify in mid-March at Day of the Year (DY) ~ 75, has a period of strong \nstratification between early June (DY ~ 150) and the end of August (DY ~ 240), reaches peak \nFigure 1 \n 9 \nstratification in early August (DY ~ 210-220) and has overturned by the end of September \n(DY ~ 275).  Peak N  values are typically around 0.07 s\n-1\n, with a maximum value of 0.09 s\n-1\n \nrecorded during the project reported here.  During the summer, the stratification extends \nthrough most of the water column, although the bottom ~0.5m remains isothermal even when \nN  is maximal. In winter, there are occasional, weak stratifying events, either due to \nunseasonally warm weather, or to unusually cold periods (for this location) when the water \nsurface temperature descends below 4\u00b0C.  Example profiles from throughout the year are \nshown in Figure 1b. \nFigure 1c shows temperature variations over the whole period for which \nmeteorological data was available, at 0.25 m depth intervals.  A clear annual pattern is \ndiscernable, matching that classically found in monomictic lakes globally.  From midwinter, \nthere is a period when the whole water column warms but remains isothermal before the onset \nof stratification.  The whole of the water column then continues to warm until the point of \npeak stratification, at a rate that increases with decreasing depth below the surface.  After this \npeak, the stratification begins to break down from the surface downwards, thus there is a \nperiod where the surface water cools but the water at depth continues to warm, until the water \ncolumn becomes warm and isothermal (usually in the latter half of September) whereafter it \ncools back to its midwinter state.   \n \nSeveral-day time scale variations in stratification. \nFigure 1 indicates that there are clearly shorter time scale variations in overall \nstratification N  superimposed on the seasonal changes.  These have been analysed by \ncalculating correlations between N  and meteorological variables.  Of these, air temperature \nprovided the best correlation.  In order to determine the time scale which characterises these \nsub-seasonal variations, correlation coefficients r were calculated between N  values and the \nFigure 2 \n 10 \naverage air temperature ( )DTair  during the D days up to and including the day on which N  \nwas measured (D = 1 to 15).  Both N  and ( )DTair  were seasonally de-trended for this \ncalculation by subtracting the corresponding 90-day centrally-averaged mean.  The correlation \ncoefficient peaked at D = 5, for which r = 0.82 (n = 41; p << 0.001, Figure 2).    This implies \nthat the time scale over which the whole water column in Priest Pot adjusts its overall \nstratification is of the order of five days, and thus that forcing mechanisms acting on this time \nscale are those which primarily determine the sub-seasonal variation of N .  This suggests that \nvariations in general weather conditions due to the passage of atmospheric pressure systems, a \nprocess which typically occurs on a time scale of a few days, play a significant role in \ncontrolling the stratification of Priest Pot.  This conjecture, however, requires further \nexamination. \n \nSub-daily time scale variation \nAlthough the shallowness of Priest Pot implies that nocturnal convective cooling \nmight be expected to have a significant effect on its stratification, we focus here on the \ndaytime structure of the water column, as this is when phytoplankton are photosynthetically-\nactive and thus when turbulence-induced vertical cycling of them through the light attenuation \ncurve will have a significant effect on their productivity.  Visual inspection of the profiles \nobtained on the different days of the campaign show that there is a surface layer that may be \ndistinguished from the rest of the water column by the way it is more strongly affected by \nvariations in daytime meteorological parameter values, especially during the period of strong \nstratification during June-August.  Taking \u2013 from observation of the SCAMP profiles \u2013 0.5m \nas a representative depth for this layer, its mean buoyancy frequency was calculated for \nprofiles taken in this period and denoted 5.0N .  Values of 5.0N ranged from 0.02 to 0.12 s\n-1\n, \ngiving values of 5.0N \/ N  from approximately 0.25 to 1.75.  These extremes represent well-\n 11 \nmixed surface layer and strong near-surface stratification relative to the rest of the water \ncolumn respectively.  Correlations between 5.0N \/ N  and the available meteorological \nvariables (see above) was calculated, of which the strongest was that with the intensity of \ndownwelling short-wave radiation, integrated from 6 a.m. until midday on the day that the \nprofiles were taken (r = 0.59; n = 14; p = 0.01).  As profiles were generally taken at around \nmidday on each of the sampling days, this variable can be taken to represent the amount of \ndaytime heating the lake received prior to the profiles being recorded.  Calculating the water \ntemperature increase due to the energy input from downwelling short wave radiation \nintegrated over this time period each day, and assuming the this energy is shared through the \ntop 0.5m of water suggests realistic average temperature increases of 2 to 8\u00b0C, thus backing \nup the inference of this statistical argument.  Correlations with wind speed \u2013 both averaged \nover the SCAMP sampling period and integrated from 6 a.m. to midday on the sampling day - \nwere, by contrast, much weaker and not statistically significant.  This provides evidence that \nthe diurnal heating-cooling cycle is the dominant forcing factor on the stratification of this \nupper layer in Priest Pot and that wind-induced mixing has a relatively limited effect in this \nrespect. \n \nTurbulence \nValues of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate in the uppermost 0.5m of the \nwater column \u03b50.5 were on the order 10\n-8\n m\n2\ns\n-3\n, which is small compared with those found in \nother measurements of surface layers (e.g., MacIntyre, 1993, who reported 10\n-7\n m\n2\ns\n-3\n).  In a \nwaterbody as small as Priest Pot with no inflows or outflows, it can be assumed that the \nsource of turbulence is wind stress. Analysis of correlations with the available meteorological \ndata showed that the strongest correlation (r = 0.81; n = 14; p < 0.001) was with wind speed \nmeasurements, averaged between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on the SCAMP fieldwork days (i.e. the \nFigure 3 \n 12 \nperiod during which the set of profiles was taken), corroborating this assumption.  Further \nsupport for this theory is supplied by comparing estimates of the energy flux Fq due to the \nwind stress at the water surface with the energy dissipation rate \u03b5.  Using the wind stress \nformulation of Large and Pond (1981) and wind speed data from Priest Pot in 2002, the order \nof magnitude of the shear velocity is calculated as u* ~ 10\n-2\n ms\n-1\n.  Thus Fq = \u00bdCN\n3\nu*\n3\n (Kim \n1976) where CN is of order unity (MacIntyre et al. 2002) gives the order of magnitude of the \nenergy flux as Fq ~ 10\n-6\n m\n3\ns\n-3\n.  Given that W\u00fcest et al. (2000) report that typically of the order \nof 1% of the wind energy flux is dissipated by turbulence in the mixed surface layer of lakes, \nthis value of Fq is consistent with the measured values of \u03b5 ~ 10\n-8\n m\n2\ns\n-3\n, to the nearest order of \nmagnitude. \nValues of vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity KZ averaged on the order of 10\n-5\n m\n2\ns\n-1\n \nwith values in the range 10\n-4\n\u201310\n-6\n m\n2\ns\n-1\n in the upper layer, but were an order of magnitude \nsmaller in the stratified water column below this.  Again, these are small compared with \nmeasurements of the same variable using similar techniques found by, for example, \nMacIntyre (1993) in North Lake, Western Australia (surface area 2.9\u00d710\n5\n m\n2\n; maximum \ndepth 2.6m; KZ 10\n-3\n to 10\n-5\n m\n2\ns\n-1\n) and Lorke (1998) in M\u00fcggelsee, Germany (surface area \n7.3\u00d710\n6\n m\n2\n; maximum depth 8m; KZ 10\n-2 \n to 10\n-7\n m\n2\ns\n-1\n).   \n Analysis of the nature of the turbulence found in the SCAMP profiles using plots of \nthe turbulent Froude and Reynolds numbers \u2013 FrT and ReT respectively \u2013 known as \nhydrodynamic phase diagrams (Ivey and Imberger, 1991) illustrate that, during the period of \nstrong stratification from June to August, \u201cactive\u201d turbulence (i.e. overturns untrammelled by \ndamping due to viscosity or buoyancy) is found in the upper layer when it is well-mixed, but \ndoes not penetrate below this into the stratified layer, as shown for July 28\nth\n in Figure 3a.  \nNeither does active turbulence occur in the upper layer when it too is stratified, as shown for \nAugust 8\nth\n in Figure 3b.  In these stratified layers, the turbulence is predominantly damped by \n 13 \nboth viscosity and buoyancy, as shown.  As the stratification starts to break down at the end \nof August, active turbulence is able to penetrate below the top 0.5m of the water column \n(Figure 4a) and is common throughout the water column once the pond has overturned at the \nstart of October (Figure 4b).   \nOn July 28\nth\n, when the depth of the surface mixed layer was ~0.4m, the maximum \nThorpe displacement LTmax was ~0.1m.  In the strongly stratified regime found on August 8\nth\n, \nLTmax was of the order of a few centimetres, an order of magnitude smaller than the length \nscale of the layers of fluid with slightly less than the profile-average temperature gradient \nwhich are discernable in the profile.  These two days are representative of the mixed and \nstratified cases observed on the other data collection days respectively.  Thus, in both these \ncases, the wind-induced turbulence was too weak to produce overturns with length scales \ncomparable to the mixed layer depth.  This provides evidence that vertical transport in this \nregion during the daytime is mediated by the quasi-diffusive effect of many small overturns, \nrather than the advective effect of single large overturns.   \n \nDiscussion \nThe significance of this work lies in its elucidation of the character of the stratification \nand turbulent mixing within Priest Pot, which stands as a particularly species-rich example of \nthe type of ponds which make a major contribution to species diversity (e.g. Oertli et al., \n2005).  The understanding of the physical framework provided, and the evidence presented to \nsupport the picture presented, provide important underpinning for the development of \napproaches to enhancing and sustaining the ecological health of these environments. \n Priest Pot shows many of the characteristics classically found in lakes during the \nsummer: a permanently stratified water column with a distinct surface layer which mixes and \nre-stratifies on a diurnal basis, a strongly stratified metalimnetic layer within which the \nFigure 4 \n 14 \noxycline occurs and a relatively isothermal benthic layer.  What is surprising about Priest Pot \nis that all this structure occurs in a small pond with a surface area of only a hectare and a \nmaximum depth of only 3.5m.  Usually, waterbodies this shallow tend to be much more \nsensitive to meteorological forcing (e.g., Talling, 2001) and have a stronger mixing regime \n(e.g., MacIntyre, 1993).  Spence et al. (2003) measured Skeeter Lake (surface area 5\u00d710\n4\n m\n2\n; \nmaximum depth 6.6m) in Northern Canada, and arguably the conditions closest to those in \nPriest Pot that have been reported in the literature.  They focus their work on the surface heat \nflux budget, noting that the relative lack of penetration of heat from the atmosphere caused by \na relatively weak mixing regime and strong near-surface attenuation of radiation means that \nmore heat is available in the near surface waters for evaporative exchange into the \natmosphere.  Thus the strongly stratified summer character of small waterbodies such as \nPriest Pot and Skeeter Lake is important for their climatic influence.  Although individually, \nthis influence will be very small for waterbodies of this size, their abundance (as noted above) \nimplies that their concerted effect will be significant.   \nThree factors can be identified whose potential as causes of Priest Pot\u2019s unusually \nunmixed character are supported by the observations reported here.  Firstly, Priest Pot is \nrelatively sheltered causing wind speeds to be, on average, 75% of those measured less than a \nkilometre away on Esthwaite Water.  Together with the lack of fetch available to the wind \u2013 \nPriest Pot\u2019s longest axis measures less than 200m \u2013 this suggests that wind-induced mixing \nwill be limited.  Secondly, the presence of high concentrations of seston in the water column, \nwhich were clearly evident during fieldwork, can be reasonably expected to limit the \npenetration of radiation below the surface layer and exacerbate the stratification.   \nFinally, Priest Pot experiences rather modest (in a global context) diurnal variations in \nambient air temperature, as would be expected of the temperate, maritime climate in which it \nis situated.  This is illustrated by the data presented in Figure 5, which shows that the diurnal \nFigure 5 \n 15 \ntemperature range for Priest Pot during the summer has an average value of 6.1\u00b0C.  This is \nsignificantly less than typical global values for diurnal temperature range (see, for example, \nFigure 3 of Essery et al. (2003), which displays summer values of \u226510\u00b0C for a wide range of \nclimatic regions).  This is likely to limit the effect of nocturnal convective cooling, as \nevidenced by the location of the oxycline at ~1m depth throughout the summer (data not \npresented).  We can test this assumption by calculating the order of magnitude of the turbulent \ndissipation rate due to convective cooling, which may be taken to be equivalent to the order of \nmagnitude of the convective buoyancy flux.  To calculate this, we determine the surface heat \nflux H, which is given by \n \neh\nout\nlo\nin\nlo QQQQH ++\u2212=       (3) \n \nwhere 4AA\nin\nlo TQ \u03c3\u03b5=  and \n4\nWW\nout\nlo TQ \u03c3\u03b5= are the long wave radiative influx and efflux \nrespectively (\u03b5 is emissivity, \u03c3 = 5.67\u00d710\n-8\n Wm\n-2\nK\n-4\n, T is the temperature in Kelvin and the \nsubscripts A and W denote values for air and water respectively), \n( )AWAhpAAh TTUCCQ \u2212\u03c1=  is the sensible heat flux (\u03c1A = 1.2 kgm\n-3\n is air density, CpA \n=1000 Jkg\n-1\nK\n-1\n is the specific heat capacity of air, Ch = 1.4\u00d710\n-3\n is a transfer coefficient \n(Hicks, 1972; Jones et al. 2005) and UA is the wind speed) and ( )A*WAeAe qqULCQ \u2212\u03c1=  is \nthe latent heat flux (L = 2.45\u00d710\n6\n Jkg\n-1\n is the specific latent heat of evaporation, Ce = 1.4\u00d710\n-3\n \nis a transfer coefficient (Hicks, 1972; Jones et al. 2005), *Wq  is the saturated specific humidity \nat the water surface and qA is the specific humidity of the air.  Water surface temperature and \nwind speed values for these calculations were taken from the summer 2002 records for Priest \nPot.  The air temperature values were not available at Priest Pot for this period, but were \ncalculated from air temperature data from the nearby Esthwaite Water meteorological buoy \n 16 \n(see above) using a linear regression between data at these two sites at times when both were \navailable.  Relative humidity and atmospheric pressure measurements were also taken from \nthe Esthwaite Water buoy, as they were not available at Priest Pot.  Neither of these last two \nvariables was expected to vary significantly over the 1km distance between the Esthwaite \nWater buoy and Priest Pot, so their values were not adjusted in any way.  The buoyancy flux \nB is defined as  \n \n0pWC\nHg\nB\n\u03c1\n\u03b1\n=         (4) \n \nwhere g is gravitational acceleration, \u03b1 the thermal expansion coefficient of water (calculated \nas \u03b1 = 1.6\u00d710\n-5\n + 9.6\u00d710\n-6\nTW where TW is in degrees Celsius) and \u03c10 is a reference water \ndensity value.  This gave average values of B ~ 10\n-8\n m\n2\ns\n-3\n, which is the same order of \nmagnitude as the dissipation values for the weak, wind-driven turbulence measured during the \nday.  To calculate an order of magnitude measure of the penetrative depth LP for convection \ncharacterised by this buoyancy flux, we note that LP = LP(B,N), and thus by dimensional \narguments LP ~ (B\/N\n3\n)\n1\/2\n.  For a range of values of N = 10\n-2\n-10\n-1\n s\n-1\n (c.f. Figure 1a) that might \nbe expected below the surface mixed layer, this gives LP ~ 10\n-5\/2\n-10\n-1 \nm, i.e. on the order of a \nfew centimetres to ten centimetres.  This is consistent with the inference that the oxycline \ndepth is an indication of the maximum extent of nocturnal convective cooling.  The \nimplication of this is that the variation in the stratification of the surface layer is governed \ndominantly by variations in the fluxes of radiative, sensible and latent heat at the water \nsurface, rather than by either wind-induced mixing, and that the convective mixing due to \nnocturnal surface heat losses is limited to the upper few tens of centimetres of the water \ncolumn.  However, this conclusion remains somewhat speculative, because we have no direct \n 17 \nmeasurements of the nocturnal convective cooling.  Further work is thus required to clarify \nthis issue. \nThe data presented here provides evidence that the key meteorological forcing factors \nhave more clearly separate roles here than in more open waterbodies.  The strong (weak) \ncorrelation between surface layer stratification and solar radiation (wind speed) described \nabove and the character of the surface layer turbulence (Figure 3) suggest that the thermal \nstructure of the water column is due pre-dominantly to heating and cooling, rather than wind \nforcing, and that the wind causes active turbulence only in mixed layers already set up by the \nthermodynamic processes.  The turbulence it produces is characterised by length scales which \nare much smaller than the depth of the mixed layer, implying diffusion-like vertical transport.  \nAs a result, and taking the r.m.s. Thorpe scale LT to represent the typical overturn length \nscale, the time it takes for a patch of plankton to spread over the extent of a turbulent overturn \nis LT\n2\n\/8Kz (MacIntyre, 1993), which for the surface mixed layers observed here has a value on \nthe order of five seconds.  This is so small because the overturns are only one or two \ncentimetres wide, and is much smaller than the time scale pi\/ 5.0N  over which the overturns are \nproviding a positive buoyancy flux, prior to restratifying at later times (MacIntyre, 1993), \nwhich here is on the order of a minute.  This implies that the efficiency with which the \nphytoplankton in the surface mixed layer are mixed through the light attenuation curve is not \nhampered by the stratification ( 5.0N ) of the water column.  \nThe picture of the physical structure of Priest Pot\u2019s water column that has emerged in \nthis paper may have been at least partially assumed a priori, but the work reported has \ncontributed both a clarification of the role of the meteorological, climatic and environmental \ncontext of the pond, and evidence to support this picture.  The strength and persistence of the \nstratification provides a multiplicity of ecological niches, enabling the pond to accommodate a \nwide variety of organisms in a small space and giving it its unusually high biodiversity (see \n 18 \nFinlay and Maberley, 2000).  The weakness and lack of penetration of vertical mixing at the \ncentre of the pond implies that some other mechanism must be dominantly responsible for \nsupplying nutrients to the surface layer.  Although these views are purely speculative, \nintuition suggests that the lack of fetch is likely to constrain strongly the formation of internal \nseiches and other internal wave motions.  Thus we theorise that nutrient resuspension near the \npond edge due to internal wave breaking is likely to be weak.  A more likely candidate may \nbe supply of nutrients by groundwater flow into the pond.  Priest Pot sits in a moist context, \nbeing is surrounded by marsh and carr, and is known to have a significant groundwater input \n(S. Maberley, pers. comm.).  The groundwater input is not so strong that it showed up clearly \nin any of the SCAMP profiles, but it may provide an input of nutrient-rich water at the pond\u2019s \nshore that could then be transported to its centre via, for example, gravity currents formed by \ndifferential heating.  As noted, however, these ideas are purely speculative, and current \nresearch (Coates and Folkard, in preparation) is aimed at understanding the effects of near \nshore processes on the physical structure of this valuable waterbody. \n \nAcknowledgements \nFunding for this work was provided by the UK Natural Environment Research Council \nthrough the award of grant NER\/B\/S\/2002\/00532.
