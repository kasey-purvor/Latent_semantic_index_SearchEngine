INTRODUCTION\nF IELD-EMISSION DISPLAYS (FEDs) are characterizedby superior display performances such as fast response\ntime, wide viewing angles, wide operation temperatures,\ncathode-ray-tube-like colors, ultraslim features, low cost, and\nlow-power consumption [1]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have\ninherent advantages as a field emitter material due to their\nexcellent field-emission (FE) characteristics, strong chemical\nstability, and high mechanical strength. With the advances of\nusing CNTs as field emitters, FEDs have already shown great\npromise to compete in the large-size display market [2].\nFEDs can be operated in either diode or triode mode devices.\nThe triode structure with a gate electrode much closer to the\ncathode to extract electrons has high-emission current densities\nat low voltages and is therefore preferred for FEDs, which leads\nto lower driving voltage, high light efficiency, smooth gray\nscale imaging, and fast response for moving pictures [3]. In\nthe past, much effort was expended on optimizing the process\ntechnologies and device structures to achieve higher emission\ncurrent density, lower turn-on voltage, lower gate leakage for\nlow power, and higher efficiency [1], [3]. To integrate a given\nFE triode device into a display system for desired performance,\nit is highly preferred to be able to timely and accurately\nevaluate the device\u2019s electrical behaviors in the early circuit\nand system design stage. Therefore, an efficient and accurate\nSPICE-compatible model must be developed for this purpose.\nHowever, the complicated device structure and FE mechanisms\npose considerable challenges on device modeling.

MODELING ISSUES AND THE\nMACROMODELING APPROACH\nDue to the strong dependence of the electrical characteristics\non process and physical structures, and the fairly complicated\nFE mechanisms of CNT, it is impractical to develop an efficient\nand accurate physical model for the CNT FE devices to be\nused in SPICE circuit simulations to evaluate their electrical\nperformance in the early circuit and system design stage. Ad-\nditionally, due to the complicated triode structure, it is also\ntoo difficult to accurately extract all the intradevice parasitic\nresistances and capacitances. A simple route is by using a two-\nterminal Fowler\u2013Nordheim (F\u2013N) SPICE diode model to re-\nplace the three-terminal configuration for fitting the dependence\nof the cathode current on the gate-cathode voltage only [4], as\nshown in Fig. 1(a). However, this method is not only physically\ninaccurate but also neglects the impact from the gate-to-cathode\nleakage current.\nThe proposed macromodeling approach is described in\nFig. 1(b). Both the anode-to-cathode (Iac) and gate-to-cathode\n(Igc) currents are modeled by voltage-controlled current\nsources. The 1-D piecewise linear (PWL) function in SPICE\nis used to describe the current sources through modeling the\nIac\u2013VG\u2212C and Igc\u2013VG\u2212C characteristics by directly specifying\nthe experimentally measured data points [5].

(a) Simple SPICE model using F-N diode model to replace the three-\nterminal configuration for CNT FE triode devices. (b) Proposed macromodeling\napproach for developing SPICE-compatible CNT triode FE device models.\nThe voltage-controlled current sources Igc and Iac are modeled by directly\nspecifying the experimental data points via the PWL function in SPICE.\nDuring normal electrical characterization of the FE devices,\nthe experimental data of Iac\u2013VG\u2212C and Igc\u2013VG\u2212C characteris-\ntics at different anode voltage (VA) bias is obtained by varying\nthe gate voltage (VG) with the fixed cathode voltage (VC) and\nanode-to-cathode voltage (VA\u2212C). But, in an actual display\nmatrix, the gray-scales of each FE element are modulated by\nchanging VC with the fixed VG and VA, and thus VA\u2212C changes\nas VG\u2212C varies for different gray-scales. However, considering\nthe VA is much larger than the variations of VC during the full\ngray-scale modulation, the experimentally measured Iac\u2013Vgc\nand Igc\u2013Vgc data can still be directly used in the modeling.\nIn Fig. 1(b), Cgc represents the parasitic capacitance between\nthe gate and cathode, and is important for transient circuit\nsimulations. Cgc can be extracted by using three-dimensional\nfield solvers.\nThe macro-modeling approach is used to model two types\nof CNT FE triode devices with different structures: one is the\ndevice with CNT on silicon post structure, and the other is the\ndevice with CNTs in open aperture structure and the sidewall\noxide spacer to reduce the gate leakage current. Details about\nthe fabrication of the FE devices can be found in [6] and [7],\nrespectively. Fig. 2 shows the perfect fitting of the simulation\nresults based on the macro-model to the experimental data\nof both devices. Actually, because the experimental data of\na given device is directly input into the model, the model\ncan reproduce the real electrical characteristics of the device\nwith no deviations, and since the modeling method doesn\u2019t\nneed any procedures for physical equations, derivation and\nparameter extraction, it can also perform very efficiently by\nquickly developing SPICE compatible device models for the\nFig. 2.

The\nderived model is based on the input experimental data, and\nthus is only valid for the given CNT FE device. However, it\ndoesn\u2019t mean that the models derived by this macro-modeling\napproach have less generality than those derived by a standard\nmodeling method, since by a standard modeling method, even\nif a universal model can be derived, extraction of new model\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The details of the operation and simulation setup\nof the pixel circuit can be found in [4], [8]. Fig. 4(a) shows the\nelectrical characteristics of two types of FE triode devices being\nused in the simulations. It is assumed, in the two cases, the total\nemission current from the cathode is same, but with different\ngate-to-cathode leakage (Igc). Fig. 4(b) presents the simulated\nanode-to-cathode current (Iac) as a function of the input data\ncurrent for the pixel circuit. The increase of Igc decreases Iac,\nthus result in a reduction in the brightness and also contrast.\nThis simulation example proves the macro-modeling approach\ncan be used to effectively model the CNT FE triode devices\nfor circuit simulations. The results also indicate that, through\nconsidering the gate leakage current into the modeling, the\nsimulations can quickly predict the effects of gate leakage on\nthe display performance.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nA simple and effective macro-modeling approach is intro-\nduced to quickly develop SPICE compatible device models for\nCNT triode FE devices in display applications. The approach\nhas been proved to be able to accurately model the CNT triode\nFE devices independent of the device process and physical\nstructures for circuit simulations.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
