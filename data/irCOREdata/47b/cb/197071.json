To uncover candidate \ntherapeutic targets and networks involved in \npathogenesis we integrated gene expression \nprofiling and functional genetic screening to \nidentify genes critical for mutant htt toxicity in \nyeast. Using mRNA profiling we have identified \ngenes differentially expressed in wild-type yeast \nin response to mutant htt toxicity, as well as in \nthree toxicity suppressor strains: bna4 , mbf1 , \nand ume1 . BNA4 encodes the yeast homolog of \nkynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), a \npromising drug target for HD. Intriguingly, \ndespite playing diverse cellular roles, these \nthree suppressors share common differentially \nexpressed genes involved in stress response, \ntranslation elongation, and mitochondrial \ntransport. We then systematically tested the \nability of the differentially expressed genes to \nsuppress mutant htt toxicity when \noverexpressed, and have thereby identified 12 \nnovel suppressors, including genes that play a \nrole in stress response, Golgi to endosome \ntransport, and rRNA processing. Integrating \nthe mRNA profiling data and the genetic \nscreening data we have generated a robust \nnetwork which shows enrichment in genes \ninvolved in rRNA processing and ribosome \nbiogenesis. Strikingly, these observations \nimplicate dysfunction of translation in the \npathology of HD. Recent work has shown that \nregulation of translation is critical for lifespan \nextension in Drosophila and that manipulation \nof this process is protective in Parkinson\u2019s \ndisease models.  In total these observations \nsuggest that pharmacological manipulation of \ntranslation may have therapeutic value in HD.  \nThe fatal neurodegenerative disorder \nHuntington\u2019s disease (HD) is characterised by \ninvoluntary movements, psychological \nabnormalities, and cognitive dysfunction. A central \npathological hallmark of the disease is the selective \nloss of medium spiny neurons in the striatum of \nHD patients. HD is a gain-of-function disease \ncaused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the IT-\n15 gene, which encodes a polyglutamine (polyQ) \ntract in the huntingtin (htt) protein(1). The CAG \nrepeat number is polymorphic in the general \npopulation with repeat length ranging from 6 to 35, \nwhile individuals affected by HD have a repeat \nlength of greater than 35. The length of the polyQ \nexpansion in htt correlates directly with kinetics of \nits aggregation in vitro and with severity of the \ndisease in HD patients, and indirectly with age of \nonset(2). Though increased size of the triplet repeat \nexpansion correlates to an earlier age of onset, \nthere is great variability in the age of onset of HD, \neven when controlling for repeat length. Indeed, a \nstudy by the U.S.-Venezuela Collaborative \nResearch Project with HD kindreds containing \nover 18,000 individuals has found that \napproximately 40% of variation in age of onset at \ncontrolled repeat lengths is due to genetic \nmodifiers(3), suggesting that many therapeutic \ntargets may be available for treating progression of \nthis devastating disorder.  \nSince the cloning of the HD disease gene \nin 1993, several transgenic models of HD have \nbeen generated in a variety of organisms, including \nyeast, C. elegans, Drosophila, and mice. These \nTauber et al. \n2 \n \nmodels have allowed researchers to explore the \nunderlying mechanisms of HD pathogenesis, as \nwell as to perform genetic screens and to test \ncandidate therapeutic compounds. Yeast models \nhave proven to be particularly powerful and facile \nfor high-throughput approaches as well as for \nmolecular genetic manipulations(4). While not all \naspects of pathogenesis can be studied in a single-\ncell organism like yeast, expression of a mutant htt \nfragment in yeast produces several HD-relevant \nphenotypes such as formation of mutant htt-\ncontaining aggregates, transcriptional \ndysregulation, cellular toxicity, perturbations in \nkynurenine pathway metabolites, increased levels \nof reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial \ndysfunction, defects in endocytosis, and apoptotic \nevents(5). \nIn a genome-wide screen we identified 28 \ngene deletions that suppress toxicity of a mutant htt \nfragment (Htt103Q) in yeast(6).   We focus on \nthree of these suppressor genes in this study: \nBNA4, MBF1, and UME1. BNA4 encodes the yeast \nhomolog of the mammalian enzyme kynurenine 3-\nmononygenase (KMO), which catalyzes the \nhydroxylation of kynurenine in the kynurenine \npathway of tryptophan degradation(7). Increased \nlevels of two neurotoxic kynurenine pathway \nmetabolites downstream of KMO have been \nimplicated in the pathophysiology of HD: 3-\nhydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and quinolinic acid \n(QUIN)(8). The kynurenine pathway metabolites \nand enzymes are well conserved between yeast and \nhumans, and the genetics of the pathway has been \nextensively characterized in yeast(7). We have \ndissected this pathway in yeast with regards to its \ninfluence on mutant htt toxicity, and found that \nmuch like in HD patients the levels of 3-HK and \nQUIN are increased in cells expressing a toxic \nmutant htt fragment(6,9). Importantly, we found \nthat lowering levels of these metabolites in yeast by \ngenetic or pharmacological inhibition of Bna4 \nameliorates disease-relevant phenotypes.  \nUme1 is a component of the Rpd3 histone \ndeacetylase (HDAC) complex in yeast. Several \nstudies in fly and mouse models of HD have shown \nthat inhibition of HDAC function either \npharmacologically or genetically ameliorates HD-\nrelevant phenotypes(10). In addition, we have \nfound that HDAC inhibitors decrease levels of 3-\nHK and KMO activity in R6\/2 HD model mice and \nin primary microglia cultured from these \nanimals(8). Ume1 is required for full \ntranscriptional repression of a subset of genes in \nyeast, in a mechanism requiring Rpd3 and \nSin3(11), suggesting that genetic inhibition of the \nyeast Rpd3 HDAC complex relieves polyQ toxicity \nin a mechanism similar to that observed in fly and \nmouse polyQ disease models. We have previously \nfound that in ume1  cells expressing Htt103Q both \nkynurenine pathway genes (BNA1, BNA2, BNA4, \nBNA5) and kynurenine pathway metabolites (3-HK \nand QUIN) are downregulated as compared to \nwild-type cells expressing the same construct(8). \nInterestingly, we also found that the genes down-\nregulated in wild-type cells expressing Htt103Q \ncells are enriched for Rpd3-target genes.  These \nobservations directly link transcriptional \ndysregulation and perturbations in the kynurenine \npathway in HD(8).   \nMBF1 encodes a transcriptional coactivator \nconserved from yeast to humans that bridges the \nDNA-binding region of transcriptional activator \nGcn4 and TATA-binding protein (TBP) Spt15, a \ngeneral transcription factor required for \ntranscription by the three nuclear RNA \npolymerases (I, II, III)(12,13). Interestingly, a \npolyQ expansion in TBP in humans leads to \nSpinocerebellar ataxia 17, which in many patients \nhas phenotypes indistinguishable from HD(14). \nGcn4 is considered to be the master regulator of \namino acid metabolism in yeast. It is a member of \nthe AP-1 family of transcription factors, and \nregulates the expression of genes involved in 19 \nout of 20 amino acid biosynthetic pathways, purine \nbiosynthesis, autophagy (APG1, APG13, APG14), \nand multiple stress responses(15). In addition, it \nhas been observed that ~90 RPL (Ribosomal \nProtein, Large subunit) and RPS (Ribosomal \nProtein, Small subunit) genes which encode \nribosomal proteins are repressed by activation of \nGcn4 under stress conditions(15).  \nHere we expand on our previous studies by \nusing a unique combination of functional \napproaches and differential gene expression \nanalysis on a genome-wide scale. In order to \nidentify critical genes\/pathways\/networks involved \nin suppression of mutant htt toxicity, we employ \noligonucleotide microarray analysis to identify \ngenes differentially expressed in mutant htt \nexpressing cells compared to controls, as well as in \nthree suppressor deletion strains expressing a toxic \nmutant htt fragment: bna4 , mbf1 , and \nTauber et al. \n3 \n \nume1 We next functionally interrogate 380 of \nthese differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by \ntesting the effect of overexpression of the \nrespective ORFs on mutant htt toxicity in yeast, \nand thereby identify 14 DEGs that modulate \nmutant htt toxicity. In total this work identifies \nribosomal biogenesis and rRNA processing as \ncritical cellular processes modulated in eukaryotic \ncells expressing a mutant htt fragment, which \nsuggests these processes are likely relevant to HD \npathophysiology and therapy.  \n \nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n \nYeast strains and DNA constructs - The strains \nused for microarray experiments were from the \nyeast gene deletion set in the MATa (BY4741) \n[MATa his3\u03941 leu2\u03940 met15\u03940 ura3\u03940] strain \nbackground (Open Biosystems). The Y258 strain \nbackground [MATa pep4-3, his4-580, ura3-53, \nleu2-3,112] was used for the overexpression \nstudies (Open Biosystems). The constructs pYES2-\nHtt25Q-GFP and pYES2-Htt103Q-GFP(16) were \nused for the microarray studies. Htt103Q is a \ngalactose (GAL)-inducible, FLAG- and GFP-\ntagged construct encoding the first 17 amino acids \nof Htt fused to a polyQ tract of 103 glutamines. \nThe constructs p425GALL-Htt25Q-GFP and \np425GALL-Htt103Q-GFP were used in the yeast \noverexpression studies and were generated by \namplifying the huntingtin constructs from pYES2-\nHtt25Q-GFP and pYES2-Htt103Q-GFP and \ncloning into the SpeI and XhoI sites of \np425GALL(17). \nYeast total RNA preparation - SC \u2013Ura galactose \n(2%) cultures (12 ml) were inoculated at OD600 0.2 \nand incubated with shaking at 30\u00ba C until reaching \nan OD600 of ~1.0. Cells were harvested and lysed \nwith acid-washed glass beads. Total RNA was \nisolated with Qiagen RNeasy Midi kits, following \nstandard protocols. \nGene expression analysis by DNA oligonucleotide \narrays - Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized \nfrom total RNA, amplified\n \nas cRNA, labeled with \nbiotin, and hybridized to Affymetrix Yeast \nGenome S98 Array GeneChips, which were \nwashed and scanned\n \nat the University of \nWashington Center for Expression Arrays\n \nand at \nthe J. David Gladstone Institutes Genomics Core \nLaboratory, University of California, San Francisco \naccording to manufacturer protocols. Images were\n \nprocessed with Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 \n(MAS-5). The quality\n \nof hybridization and overall \nchip performance were determined from the MAS-\n5 generated\n \nreport file.  \nAnalysis of Microarray Data - The statistical \ncomputing language R(18) was used for quality \ncontrols, pre-processing  and analyses of the data. \nThe quality of the microarrays was assessed by \ninspecting pseudo-images of the arrays, MA scatter \nplots of the arrays versus a pseudo-median \nreference chip, and histogram and boxplot of raw \nlog intensities, and relative log expressions. \nExpression data are available through the Gene \nExpression Omnibus (GEO) database, accession \nnumber GSE18644. The data were analysed using \nthe R bioconductor package affylmGUI (version \n1.8.0), the graphic interface to limma (version \n2.9.17)(19). Data were normalized and summarised \nusing the GCRMA method(20). DEGs were \nidentified by using a moderated t-test (limma). To \ncorrect for multiple comparison we have estimated \nthe false-discovery rate (FDR) using the QVALUE \npackage(21) with a typical FDR threshold (q) of \n10%. Gene ontology searches were performed with \nthe Functional Annotation Tool \n(http:\/\/david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov\/home.jsp). Network \nvisualization was performed using the Osprey \nNetwork Visualization System (Version 1.2.0), \nwhich is  powered by the BioGRID database \n(http:\/\/www.thebiogrid.org)(22). Cis-regulatory \nelements of the DEGs were identified using the \nMUSA algorithm(23) in the YEASTRACT \nsuite(24). The Position Weight Matrix of each \nfamily was used to search for known transcription \nfactor binding sites in the YEASTRACT database \nusing the Smith-Waterman local alignment \nalgorithm (using the sum of the squared distances \nmetric). \nReal-Time Quantitative PCR - The BY4741 yeast \nstrain was transformed independently with pYES2-\nHtt103Q-GFP and pYES2-Htt25Q(16) by standard \nprocedures. Yeast cells were grown overnight in \ncomplete media lacking uracil (SC-URA) \ncontaining glucose (2%) as a carbon source. \nCultures were diluted back to optical density 0.4 \nand grown in SC-URA containing galactose (2%) \nto induce protein expression. Cells were harvested \nafter growing 25 hours, pelleted and stored at -80\u00baC \nuntil needed. RNA was extracted using the Qiagen \nRNeasy Midi kits following manufacturer \ninstructions. Genomic DNA contamination was \nTauber et al. \n4 \n \nremoved from RNA using Turbo DNAse according \nto the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. 500 ng of RNA was \nused as a template to synthesize cDNA with the \nQiagen QuantiTect\n\u00ae\n Reverse Transcription kit. To \nensure that RNA had no genomic DNA \ncontamination a control reaction was included in \nwhich no reverse transcription was carried out. 17 \ngenes were selected to analyse the mRNA \nexpression levels by quantitative PCR and actin-1 \nwas chosen as a reference. Reactions were carried \nout in a LightCycler Real-Time PCR System \n(Roche). cDNA was quantified using 5 ul of Sybr \nGreen (Fermentas) and 0.3 uM of forward and \nreverse primers. Primers were analyzed for \nspecificity and efficiency by melting curve \nanalysis. The efficiency was calculated at the end \nof each amplification reaction via relative standard \ncurves. PCR efficiencies ranged from 0.80 to 1.0. \nStandard curves were calculated using the \namplification of 5 serial dilutions of genomic DNA \nin triplicate. At least three independent cDNA \nsamples were analysed. PCR reactions were run in \nduplicate. Relative quantification was performed \nusing LightCycler\n\u00ae\n 480 Relative Quantification \nSoftware. The crossing points were calculated by \nthe second derivative method and relative \nexpression was calculated by the available \nadvanced relative quantification. Further analysis \nand statistical tests were performed using the \nRelative Expression Software 2008 (REST)(25,26). \nThe relative quantification was corrected for PCR \nefficiency via both methods.  \nFunctional Testing of DEGs - Yeast strains \ncontaining plasmids for the overexpression of \nselected genes were obtained from the yeast ORF \ncollection in the Y258 strain background. The \nrelevant yeast strains were grown overnight in 96 \nwell plates containing 100 \u00b5l of SC-URA \nsupplemented with 2% glucose  per well and \ntransformed with either p425GALL-Htt25Q-GFP or \np425GALL-Htt103Q-GFP using a high throughput \ntransformation method(4). Transformants were \ngrown to stationary phase in complete media \nlacking uracil and leucine (SC\u2013Ura\u2013Leu) \ncontaining 2% glucose, serial diluted, and spotted \nonto SC-Ura-Leu media supplemented with either \n2% glucose or 2% galactose and 2% raffinose. \nPlates were incubated at 30\u02daC for 3-5 days and \nyeast strains scored for growth. \nDetermination of RNQ prion status - 20 ml cultures \nof suppressor strains were grown to approximately \nan OD600 1.0 in SC \u2013Ura GAL\/RAF media, at \nwhich point cells were harvested by centrifugation \nat 3000 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed \nwith 10 ml water and spun as above. The cell \npellets were resuspended in 200 l lysis buffer (100 \nmM Tris pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 5% \nglycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 1X protease inhibitor \ncocktail) and transferred to microfuge tubes. The \ncells were lysed by addition of ~200 \u00b5l of acid \nwashed glass beads (425-600 m, Sigma, St. Louis, \nMO), vortexing for 1 min, addition of 200 l of \nRIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, \n1% Triton, 0.5 % Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), \nand further vortexing for 10 sec. Samples were \nthen centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 sec to pellet \nthe glass beads and cell debris. 60 l of supernatant \nwas used as the \u201cTotal\u201d sample, while 200 l of the \nsupernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 80,000 \nrpm in the Beckman TLA 100 Ultracentrifuge. 60 \nl of the supernatant from this step was isolated \nand used at the \u201cSoluble\u201d fraction, while the \n\u201cPellet\u201d fraction was prepared by resuspending the \npellet in 100 l of lysis buffer and 100 l of RIPA \nbuffer, adding 67 l of 4X protein sample buffer \n(SB), and boiling for 5 minutes. 20 l of 4X SB \nwas added to the \u201cTotal\u201d and \u201cSoluble\u201d fractions, \nand boiled for 5 min. The samples were resolved \nby SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described \nabove. Curing yeast strains of endogenous prion \ncells was performed by growth for 5 passages on \nYPD supplemented with 5 mM guanidine \nhydrochloride (GuHCl) (27). \n \nRESULTS \n \nYeast expressing a mutant htt fragment \ndifferentially express genes involved in ribosome \nbiogenesis and rRNA processing. We recently \nperformed oligonucleotide microarray \nhybridization assays to compare mRNA expression \nprofiles of isogenic parental yeast (BY4741, MAT \na) expressing either a wild-type or mutant htt \nfragment (Htt25Q or Htt103Q, respectively)(9). \nHere we re-analysed the data from this experiment \nusing the limma package implemented in \nR\/Bioconductor(19,28).This analysis showed that \nin Htt103Q-expressing cells, expression of 226 \ngenes was up-regulated when compared to Htt25Q-\nexpressing cells, whereas expression of 244 genes \nwas down-regulated (q value < 0.2) (Figure 1A). A \nTauber et al. \n5 \n \nsubset of these DEGs were analysed and confirmed \nvia quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR)(Table S1).  \nWe used the DAVID Bioinformatics \nResources Functional Annotation Tool \n(http:\/\/david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) to test whether the \nDEGs were enriched by known or predicted \nfunction using gene ontology (GO)(29). In a \nmanner similar to our previous analysis, functional \ngroups up-regulated significantly in the Htt103Q \nexpressing cells included genes involved in protein \nfolding (P <  1.0 x 10\n-3\n) and response to stress (P <  \n0.01)(Table S2)(9). In addition, the new analysis \nfound enrichment in the GO terms of response to \nunfolded protein (P < 1.0 x 10\n-5\n), ubiquitin cycle (P \n< 0.01), post-translational protein modification (P < \n0.01), and vacuolar protein catabolic process (P < \n0.05). We previously described that down-\nregulated genes in Htt103Q-expressing cells were \ninvolved in the functional groups of ribosome \nbiogenesis (P < 1.0 x 10\n-39\n) and rRNA processing \nand metabolism (P < 1.0 x 10\n-20\n)(9), and we have \nconfirmed those observations in our new analyses \n(Table S3). These data suggest that yeast cells \nexpressing Htt103Q mount a response to deal with \nthis toxic, misfolded protein, via upregulation of \nproteins involved with protein misfolding, protein \ndegradation, autophagy, and stress response. At the \nsame time, in  a manner similar to classic heat \nshock response, the presence of Htt103Q in yeast \ncells causes a dramatic reduction in expression of \ngenes involved in rRNA metabolism and ribosome \nbiogenesis, suggesting that general protein \nsynthesis in these cells is significantly repressed, \nultimately contributing to Htt103Q-dependent \ntoxicity.  \nCommon mechanisms underlie mutant htt \ntoxicity suppression in gene deletion suppressor \nstrains. In order to discern if there are common \nmechanisms underlying toxicity suppression in \nmutant htt suppressor strains, we wished to next \nmonitor gene expression perturbations in three \ngene deletion Htt103Q suppressor strains: bna4 , \nmbf1 , and ume1 (6). Thus, we performed \nmicroarray experiments to identify DEGs in \nbna4 , mbf1 , or ume1  yeast expressing Htt103Q \nversus parental wild-type cells expressing Htt103Q. \nWe tested the 200 DEGs which showed the highest \nfold change (and q < 0.1) from each deletion \nsuppressor for enrichment of GO terms. We found \nthat in bna4  expressing Htt103Q there is an \nenrichment of several GO terms as compared to \ncontrol cells, including carboxylic acid metabolism \n(P <  1.0 x 10\n-4\n), translation elongation (P <  1.0 x \n10\n-3\n), nitrogen compound metabolism (P < 1.0 x \n10\n-3\n), water-soluble vitamin biosynthesis (P <  \n0.01), and vesicle organization and biogenesis (P <  \n0.05)(Table S4). DEGs in mbf1  cells showed \nenrichment in many GO term categories, including \namino acid metabolism (P < 1.0 x 10\n-11\n), nitrogen \ncompound metabolism (P < 1.0 x 10\n-9\n), carboxylic \nacid metabolism (P < 1.0 x 10\n-7\n), and urea cycle \nintermediate metabolic process (P < 1.0 x 10\n-4\n) \n(Table S5). The ume1  suppressor strain exhibited \nDEGs with enrichment in GO term categories of \nwater-soluble vitamin biosynthesis (P < 0.01), \nNAD biosynthesis (P < 0.01), nitrogen compound \nmetabolism (P < 0.01), carboxylic acid metabolism \n(P < 0.05), among others (Table S6). The four \ngenes present within the NAD biosynthesis GO \ngroup are the central kynurenine pathway genes of \nBNA1, BNA2, BNA4, and BNA5, confirming our \noriginal analysis with this data set(8). It is critical \nto note that while some of the GO groups enriched \nin these data are specific to individual suppressors, \nseveral categories are common amongst these \nsuppressors, such as nitrogen compound \nmetabolism and carboxylic acid metabolism. \nAs full levels of Htt103Q toxicity are \ndependent upon the presence of the Rnq1 yeast \nprion [RNQ\n+\n](16), we analysed Rnq1 prion status \nin the three gene deletion strains to ensure that the \nDEGs identified above are independent of Rnq1 \nprion. To this end, we analysed Rnq1 by \nsedimentation analysis in all three suppressor \nstrains (Figure 2A,B). We found that in all three \nstrains Rnq1 was present in the pellet fraction of \ncells expressing Htt103Q or carrying empty vector \n(pYES2), indicating that Rnq1 is present in its \nprion form independent of Htt103Q expression. \nInterestingly, in the case of the bna4  strain, we \nobserved that Rnq1 is also present in the soluble \nfraction, suggesting that this population of cells \ncontains both prion and non-prion forms of Rnq1 \n(Figure 2B). A similar phenotype has been \ndescribed with other deletion strains from this \nlibrary(30). Treatment with the prion curing agent \nGuHCl shifted Rnq1 from the pellet fraction to the \nsoluble fraction, providing further support that \nRnq1 status is \u201cmixed\u201d in the bna4 strain (Figure \n2B). To test whether prion status was directly \nTauber et al. \n6 \n \naltered by the deletion of BNA4 we analyzed a \nsecond bna4  strain, and consistent with \npreviously published work(30), we found that \nRnq1 was entirely in prion form, indicating that the \n\u201cmixed\u201d prion phenotype is independent of BNA4 \ndeletion (Figure 2C).  In total this data suggests \nthat DEGs identified in the mbf1  and \nume1 strains are independent of Rnq1 prion \nstatus, while a subset of DEGs from the BY4741 \nbna4 strain may arise from [RNQ\n+\n]-dependent \nmodulation of Htt103Q.  \nIn order to filter out DEGs dependent upon \nmodulation of Rnq1 prion status, and to ascertain if \ncommon genes\/mechanisms underlie suppression \nin the three suppressor strains, we cross-compared \nthe three sets of DEGs identified above (Figure \n1B). Strikingly, we found that 15 annotated genes \nwere common among these three groups, seven of \nwhich are also differentially expressed in WT cells \nexpressing Htt103Q (Table 1). Assuming \nindependence, the probability of finding 15 genes \nshared amongst these three groups is < 1.0 x 10\n-13\n, \nwhich supports the notion that the suppressors \nshare common mechanisms of mutant htt \nsuppression. The genes shared among the \nsuppressor strains function in a variety of cellular \nprocesses, including translation elongation (ANB1), \nstress response (DAK2), amino acid transport \n(DIP5), lactate metabolism (DLD3), and \nmitochondrial transport (YMC2). Interestingly, 3 of \nthe 15 genes are predicted to encode tRNAs, all of \nwhich are down-regulated in the suppressor strains. \nOf these genes, 2 encode tRNAs for tRNA-Pro and \none encodes tRNA-Lys (Table 1). In 13\/15 cases \nthe genes are differentially expressed in the same \ndirection in all three suppressor strains, reinforcing \nthe notion that the shared DEGs represent common \nunderlying mechanisms involved in mutant htt \ntoxicity. Intriguingly, of these 13 genes, 5 are \ndifferentially expressed in the opposite direction in \nHtt103Q-expressing cells (AQR1, DAK2, \nYGR035C, YMC2, YOR338W)(Table 1 and Table \nS7). \nThis observation led us to compare the \noverlapping DEGs from the individual suppressor \nstrains to the top 200 DEGs from Htt103Q \nexpressing cells to ascertain if a negative \ncorrelation exists in expression between these \ngroups of DEGs. Strikingly, in all three \ncomparisons we found a significant negative \ncorrelation in differential expression of the \noverlapping genes (Figure 1C). This suggests that \nthe differential expression observed in the parental \nWT strain due to expression of Htt103Q is relieved \nin the three deletion suppressor strains. Though it is \nlikely that these changes in expression profiles \ndirectly contribute to mutant htt toxicity, we cannot \nexclude the possibility that the changes are simply \na downstream consequence of cellular toxicity. \nCis-regulatory domain analysis of DEGs \nidentifies enriched elements. To clarify whether \ncommon regulatory mechanisms were affected in \nHtt103Q-expressing cells as compared to Htt25Q \ncontrols, the DEGs with local false discovery rate \n(FDR) < 2%, as estimated by the Rank product \nalgorithm (n=46), were analysed for shared \nregulatory motifs using the MUSA algorithm. This \nanalysis revealed 14 families of de novo motifs that \nwere significantly over-represented in these \nsequences(23)(Table 2).  Aligning the Position \nWeight Matrix (PWM) of each family with the \nPWM of known transcription factors revealed \nseveral matches. Interestingly, Gcn4 was among \nthe transcription factors identified, suggesting a \nlink between response to Htt103Q-dependent \ntoxicity and this transcription factor. The list of \ntranscription factors identified includes several zinc \ntranscription factors such as Hap1 (which responds \nto heme and oxygen levels), Azf1 (responds to \nglucose) and Zap1 (responds to zinc levels). Other \ncandidate transcription factors include Cup2, a \ncopper-binding transcription  factor which \nresponds to copper levels, and Ime1, which is the \nmaster regulator of meiosis, and activates early \nmeiotic genes through interactions with Ume6(31), \nanother transcription factor whose binding site was \nover-represented in the DEGs (Table 2). Ume6 \nrecruits the Rpd3-Sin3 HDAC complex during \nmitosis to repress early meiosis-specific genes via \nhypoacetylation of histones H3 and H4(32). \nCritically, Ume6 has been shown by affinity mass \nspectrometry to be a component of the Rpd3-Sin3 \ncorepressor complex along with the loss-of-\nfunction Htt103Q suppressors Ume1 and \nRxt3(6,33). Thus, this observation further \nimplicates transcriptional dysregulation in mutant \nhtt toxicity and HDACs as candidate therapeutic \ntargets. \nA unique subset of differential expressed, \nhighly interconnected genes modulate mutant htt \ntoxicity. In order to ascertain the potential role of \nTauber et al. \n7 \n \nthe DEGs in mutant htt toxicity, we individually \ntested the ability of these genes to suppress toxicity \nof Htt103Q when individually overexpressed in \nyeast. All of the genes that were available as open \nreading frame (ORF) constructs from the Yeast \nORF Collection (380\/470, 80.9%) were \nindividually tested via growth assays for \nsuppression of Htt103Q toxicity. We found that 12 \nof the DEGs suppressed toxicity of Htt103Q when \noverexpressed (Figure 3, Table 3).  To eliminate \nthe possibility that the DEGs suppressed toxicity \nby silencing Htt103Q expression, we analyzed \nexpression levels by Western and dot blotting, and \nfound that Htt103Q expression was unchanged \n(Figure S1A,B). In addition, we confirmed that \nRnq1 remains in its prion conformation when \nexpression of a DEG is induced (Figure S1C).  \nInterestingly, these overexpression \nsuppressors include genes whose expression is \nupregulated as well as genes whose expression is \ndownregulated in cells expressing Htt103Q, \nindicating two different models for overexpression \nprotection: 1) ORF overexpression mimics \nupregulation of genes exerting a protective role \nagainst mutant htt toxicity, or 2) ORF \noverexpression is rescuing a depletion of a critical \nfactor (Table 3). Excitingly, these overexpression \nsuppressors are potential candidate therapeutic \ntargets for HD. Of the 12 novel suppressors, 7 (~ \n58%) have human orthologs as determined by \nEnsembl Genome Browser \n(http:\/\/www.emsembl.org). \nWe next compared our list of DEGs with \nour previously published gene deletion enhancers \nand suppressors of mutant htt toxicity, and \nidentified another two common genes (MBF1, \nAPJ1)(6,34). Thus, in total we identified 14 DEGs \nthat modify mutant htt toxicity when overexpressed \nor deleted (Table 3).  Amongst these 14 genes, we \nobserved enrichment of genes within seemingly \nunrelated functional groups. In particular, this \ngroup was enriched for genes involved in rRNA \nprocessing (BUD23, DBP2, IPI3, NSA2, RRP9, \nUTP9), stress\/heat shock response (APJ1, JJJ3), \nand transcription (CSE2 and MBF1) (Table 3). \nInterestingly, aside from rRNA processing, all of \nthese functional groups have been extensively \nimplicated in HD pathology.  \nTo clarify the functional connectivity \namongst this functionally validated list of DEGs \nwe performed network analysis using the Osprey \nNetwork Visualization System (Version 1.2.0), \nwhich allows visualization of complex interaction \nnetworks(22). This software is powered by the \nBioGRID database (http:\/\/www.thebiogrid.org), \nwhich houses and distributes data collections of \nprotein and genetic interactions of model \norganisms, including yeast via the Saccharomyces \nGenome Database (http:\/\/www.yeastgenome.org). \nVia these databases, Osprey allows insertion of all \nknown interactions for each \u201cnode\u201d (gene of \ninterest). The interactions types (or \u201cedges\u201d) \ninclude data from affinity capture experiments, \ntwo-hybrid screens, and synthetic lethality \nanalyses, among others. Here, we have used \nOsprey to investigate all the known genetic and \nphysical interactions of the 14 functionally \nvalidated DEGs. As an initial test, we asked for all \nthe interactions within these 14 nodes. \nInterestingly, we found only one interaction \namongst these nodes, a physical interaction \nbetween Rrp9 and Utp9, both of which are \ncomponents of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) \nprocessome involved in pre-rRNA processing, as \ndetermined by affinity capture\/mass spectroscopy \nstudies(35-37) (data not shown). This result \nhighlights our observations from the GO analysis \nthat showed an enrichment in genes from disparate \nfunctional groups. In order to determine if the \nabove 14 genes function indirectly in the same \nnetwork, we explored all of the interactions for \nthese functionally validated nodes, and we found a \ntotal of 538 interactions among 464 nodes (data not \nshown). In order to select genes with higher level \nrelationships, we processed the network data with \nan iterative minimum filter of two, which identified \nall of the nodes within this group which have a \nminimum of two interactions with other genes \nwithin the group, and then sorted the remaining \nnodes by GO function (Figure 4). This analysis \nuncovered a highly interconnected network of \ngenes, which surprisingly included 11\/14 of the \noriginal functionally validated genes. Critically, \nthis network of 81 nodes (with 156 edges) \nreinforced and expanded the GO groups enriched \nin the mutant htt toxicity interaction network: \nribosome biogenesis and assembly (71.6%, P = 1.2 \nx 10\n-49\n), rRNA processing (55.6%, P = 4.7 x 10\n-43\n), \nnuclear transport (12.3%, P = 1.5 x 10\n-4\n), and G-\nprotein signalling (2.5%, P = 4.5 x 10\n-2\n). When a \nmore stringent iterative minimum filter of three is \napplied, 5\/14 modifiers are still present in the \nTauber et al. \n8 \n \nnetwork (11 nodes; 23 edges), all of which are \ninvolved in ribosome biogenesis and assembly (P = \n2.6 x 10\n-12\n), rRNA processing (P = 1.2 x 10\n-8\n), and \nrelated processes (data not shown). In total, this \nwork suggests that though these modifiers of \nmutant htt toxicity play roles in disparate \nfunctional groups, they function within a highly-\ninterrelated network.  \nDISCUSSION \n \nIn this study we utilized a novel functional \napproach to gene profiling experiments in order to \ndissect the underlying mechanisms of mutant htt \ntoxicity in yeast. This work has not only \nhighlighted the central role of rRNA processing \nand ribosome biogenesis in mutant htt toxicity in \nyeast, but has also identified several novel \nsuppressors of this toxicity which are candidate \ntherapeutic targets for HD. Several gene profiling \nexperiments with mammalian models of HD \nsupport our observations. Gene expression \nprofiling in PC12 cells and rat striatal cells \nexpressing mutant htt fragments has found an \nenrichment in genes encoding ribosomal proteins \nand RNA processing proteins(38,39). In addition, \nanalysis of gene expression in the striatum of R6\/2 \nHD model mice has found an enrichment in genes \nencoding ribosomal proteins as compared to wild-\ntype controls(40). Recently, microarray profiling \nusing a primary rat neuron model of HD found \nenrichment in genes involved in RNA \nsplicing\/RNA processing(41). Finally, an RNAi \nscreen in Drosophila cells identified several \nmodifiers of mutant htt aggregation which play a \nrole in RNA processing(42). In total, these \nobservations suggest that the results described here \nare not likely to be yeast-specific, but may reflect \ncellular perturbations conserved in mammalian \ncells. In addition, in this study we identified DEGs \nfrom bna4 , mbf1 , and ume1 strains expressing \nHtt103Q versus control cells to learn more about \nunderlying mechanisms contributing to Htt103Q \ntoxicity suppression. Analysis of prion status in \nthese strains found that in the bna4 strain Rnq1 is \npresent in both prion and soluble forms, suggesting \nthat a subset of these DEGs may arise from \nmodulation of [RNQ\n+\n] status. Thus, in order to \nreduce [RNQ\n+\n]-dependent effects we focused on \nthe cross-section of these DEGs with the DEGs \nfrom the mbf1  and ume1  strains. By this \napproach we identified 15 common DEGs amongst \nthese three gene deletion suppressor strains. These \ngenes include 3 tRNA-encoding genes, as well as \ngenes involved in a variety of cellular pathways. \nWhat is unclear in the examples above is the \nmechanism of these changes, and how these \nchanges contribute to mutant htt toxicity, and \nultimately to HD pathology. These yeast studies \nwill serve as a strong starting point for future \nstudies elucidating these underlying mechanisms.  \nA critical finding from this study is the \nidentification of a robust network of interactions \nderived from 14 differentially expressed genes \n(nodes) that modulate toxicity of a mutant htt \nfragment. Despite the original nodes playing roles \nin diverse cellular processes, the resulting network \ncontains 11 of these nodes within a network of 81 \nnodes and 156 edges, and has an enrichment of \ngenes involved in rRNA processing and ribosome \nbiogenesis. Intriguingly, several of the functionally \nvalidated nodes appear to be highly interconnected \nin the network (nodes indicated in bold in Figure \n4), underscoring the importance of these nodes \nwithin the context of the network.  \nSeveral of our observations above \nimplicate Gcn4 in mutant htt toxicity in yeast. First, \nexpression of Htt103Q in yeast leads to down-\nregulation of genes involved in ribosome \nbiogenesis, and under stress conditions Gcn4 is \nknown to repress transcription of ~90 RPL and RPS \ngenes which encode ribosomal proteins(15). \nSecond, MBF1, which is a deletion suppressor of \nHtt103Q toxicity, encodes a transcriptional \ncoactivator which can bridge Gcn4 and TBP. \nThird, we found that Gcn4 binding sequences are \nover-represented in the upstream regions of genes \ndifferentially expressed in Htt103Q-expressing \ncells. In total this work suggests that expression of \nHtt103Q in yeast may down-regulate expression of \nribosomal genes via induction of Gcn4 expression. \nAs Mbf1 expression is required for Gcn4 function, \nthese observations collectively suggest that \ndeletion of MBF1 may suppress mutant htt toxicity \nby impairing Gcn4 function. It must also be noted \nthat induction of Gcn4 leads to upregulation of \nthree kynurenine pathway genes, BNA1 (3-\nhydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase), BNA4 \n(which encodes KMO), and BNA6 (quinolinate \nphosphoribosyl transferate)(15). Intriguingly, \ndeletions of either BNA1 or BNA4 suppresses \ntoxicity of Htt103Q(6). These observations also \nTauber et al. \n9 \n \nsupport a hypothesis in which Gcn4 induction due \nto Htt103Q expression contributes to toxicity. We \ndid not, however, see differential expression of \nGCN4 in our present study in Htt103Q-expressing \ncells (data not shown). This is not particularly \nsurprising as GCN4, which is under strict \ntranscriptional control, is also under translational \ncontrol, via four small upstream ORFs (uORFs) in \nthe 5\u2019 leader region of the GCN4 mRNA(43). \nInduction of translation of the message occurs \nprimarily under environmental stresses(44). In \naddition, as recruitment of TBP via Mbf1 is the \nrate-limiting step in Gcn4 activation(12), and \nMBF1 expression is upregulated in Htt103Q-\nexpressing yeast (Table 3), it is possible that \nincreased levels of Mbf1 alone may be sufficient to \nincrease Gcn4 activity, without induction of Gcn4 \nexpression. Interestingly, lifespan extension in \nyeast due to depletion of 60s ribosomal subunits, \ndietary restriction, or TOR inhibition appears to \nrequire induction of Gcn4(45). Thus, in the case of \nmutant htt expression, Gcn4 induction may reflect \na cellular coping mechanism gone awry. This \npathway may play a similar role in humans as \nATF4, the functional ortholog of Gcn4 in \nmammals(46), is regulated via a similar \ntranslational mechanism and activation of Gcn4 is \nanalogous to the mammalian integrated stress \nresponse(47).  \nIn a related note, the yeast eIF4E-\nassociated protein Eap1, which inhibits cap-\ndependent translation initiation via the TOR \nsignalling cascade, attenuates induction of Gcn4 \ntranslation(48). Recent work has shown that \noverexpression of eIF4E-BP, the Eap1 functional \nequivalent in Drosophila, rescues parkinsonian \nphenotypes in fly models of Parkinson\u2019s disease by \ninhibiting cap-dependent translation, and thereby \ninducing expression of genes involved in stress \nresponse(49). It has also been seen that during \ndietary restriction in Drosophila 4E-BP promotes \nlifespan extension by activation of nuclear-encoded \nmitochondrial protein translation(50).  \nInterestingly, in the present study we have \nfound that the gene encoding eIF5A, a translation \nelongation factor, is upregulated in all three \nsuppressor strains expressing Htt103Q, as \ncompared to controls. Taken together, these data \nsuggest that altered regulation of translation may \nbe contributing to mutant htt toxicity, and that \npharmacological modulation of this process may \nhave therapeutic relevance. Supporting this, it has \nbeen recently shown that rapamycin treatment of \nmouse embryonic fibroblast cells expressing \nmutant htt abrogates HD-relevant phenotypes by \ninhibition of translation, independent of effects on \nautophagy(51). It is also important to note that \nwhile much interest in the HD community has been \nfocused on transcriptional dysregulation in \npathogenesis and as a target for therapeutics, our \nstudy suggests that the effect of mutant htt on \ntranslational processes in the cell may also be \ncritical. \nAs most basic cellular mechanisms are \nconserved in yeast to higher eukaryotes, the work \npresented here will likely inform future studies on \ndisease pathogenesis in HD. Due to the ease and \nrapidity of genetic screening in yeast, this organism \nis particularly amenable for integrated approaches \nto functional gene expression profiling. Yeast will \ntherefore likely provide an important platform for \nfuture analyses of disease genes, further evidenced \nby a recent study dissecting -synuclein toxicity in \nyeast(52). It is important to mention that we have \nidentified 12 novel suppressors of mutant htt \ntoxicity in yeast, 7 of which have human orthologs \nas determined by the Ensembl Genome Browser. \nFour of these yeast genes (BUD23, ENT3, NSA2, \nand RRP9) have clear 1-to-1 orthologs in humans \nwhich could potentially be targeted for therapy if \nvalidated in other model systems. Interestingly, \nENT3 has recently been identified as a suppressor \nof -synuclein toxicity in yeast(53). In summary, \nour study has provided new insights into the \nmechanisms associated with mutant htt toxicity in \nyeast which may be relevant to HD pathogenesis \nand has also identified novel candidate targets for \ntherapeutic intervention in this disorder. Clearly it \nis now critical to test the above hypotheses and to \nvalidate the candidate HD targets identified in \norder to ascertain how our observations are linked \nto mutant htt toxicity in yeast and how they may \ninform therapeutic strategies in HD patients. \nFinally, the power of using yeast to clarify \nmechanisms involved in HD pathogenesis and to \nidentify candidate drug targets is underscored by \nour recent validation of KMO as a promising \ntherapeutic target in HD model mice (Zwilling et \nal., in review).   \n \nTauber et al. \n10 \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.

Identification of DEGs in wild-type and gene deletion suppressor strains expressing Htt103Q. (A) \nVolcano plot of DEGs. The log2 of the fold change (Htt103Q versus Htt25Q) is represented on the x-axis \nand the negative log of P-values from t-test analyses is represented on the y-axis. Up-regulated genes due \nto Htt103Q have positive fold-changes. Red indicates DEGs at the FDR of q < 0.1, orange indicates 0.1 < \nq < 0.2, and blue indicates q > 0.2. (B) Venn diagram indicating the overlap in DEGs between bna4\nmbf1 , and ume1  strains expressing Htt103Q compared to the parental BY4741 strain. 15 DEGs are \nshared among the three deletion strains. (C) Inverse correlation of log fold change (M) in DEGs in \nsuppressors expressing Htt103Q on the y-axis and in a wild-type strain expressing Htt103Q (compared \nwith Htt25Q-expressing cells) on the x-axis. Blue: bna4  (r=-0.77, t = -4.19, df = 12, P < 0.01), Red:  \nmbf1  (r= -0.74, t = -4.10, df = 14, P = 0.01), Green: ume1  (r=-0.67, t = -4.84, df = 29, P < 0.0001). \n \nFig. 2. Rnq1p is present in prion conformation in gene deletion suppressor strains. [RNQ\n+\n] prion status in \nwild-type yeast and deletion suppressors (BY4741 parental strain) carrying the pYES2 empty vector or \nTauber et al. \n13 \n \nexpressing Htt103Q was determined by a combination of high-speed centrifugation and immunoblotting. \n\u201cT\u201d indicates total extract for each yeast strain, while \u201cS\u201d indicates supernatant fraction (soluble form of \nRnq1), and \u201cP\u201d indicates pellet fraction (prion form of Rnq1, [RNQ+]). (A) Immunoblotting with -Rnq1 \nantibody showed that Rnq1 is found exclusively in the pellet fraction of the BY4741 wild-type strain, as \nwell as the mbf1  and ume1  strains, indicating the protein is in the prion conformation. (B) In the \nBY4741 bna4 [RNQ\n+\n] prion status is \u201cmixed\u201d, with protein present in both pellet and supernatant \nfractions. Treatment of BY4741 bna4 parental cells carrying pYES2 with guanidine hydrochloride \n(GuHCL) cures [RNQ\n+\n] prion, shifting Rnq1p from the pellet fraction to the supernatant fraction. (C) \n[RNQ\n+\n] prion status is independent of BNA4 deletion. In Y5563 bna4  cells all Rnq1 is found in the \npellet fraction. Treatment of Y5563 bna4  cells with GuHCL cured [RNQ\n+\n] prion present in the pellet \nfraction of untreated cells carrying pYES2, moving Rnq1 to the supernatant fraction. \n \nFig. 3. Suppression of Htt103Q toxicity in yeast overexpression strains. Parental wild-type Y258 yeast \ncontaining constructs for the overexpression of the indicated yeast ORFs were transformed with p425-\nHtt25Q or p425-Htt103Q and cellular viability determined using growth assays. The expression of both \nthe huntingtin constructs and the indicated yeast ORFs is induced by galactose. Five-fold serial dilutions \nstarting with equal number of cells of the four representative ORF suppressors are shown. \nFig. 4. Network analysis uncovers a high degree of interconnectivity amongst functionally validated \nDEGs.  Osprey network analysis of 14 DEGs (indicated in bold) which suppress toxicity of Htt103Q \nwhen overexpressed. All interactions for these genes (both physical and genetic) were included in the \nanalysis. Genes described by the same significantly enriched GO terms are color-coded and grouped \ntogether. Network data analyzed with an iterative minimum filter of 2 (minimum of 2 interactions with \nother network genes). A total of 81 nodes and 156 edges define this network, which contains 11 of the \noriginal 14 functionally validated genes.  \n  \nTauber et al. \n14 \n \n \nTable 1.
