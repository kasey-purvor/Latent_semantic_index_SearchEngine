GREEN, LA\u00b4SZLO\u00b4 HE\u00b4THELYI, AND NADIA MAZZA\nAbstract. Let p be an odd prime and S a finite p-group. B. Oliver\u2019s conjec-\nture arises from an open problem in the theory of p-local finite groups. It is\nthe claim that a certain characteristic subgroup X(S) of S always contains the\nThompson subgroup. In previous work the first two authors and M. Lilienthal\nrecast Oliver\u2019s conjecture as a statement about the representation theory of\nthe factor group S\/X(S). We now verify the conjecture for a wide variety of\ngroups S\/X(S).\n1. Introduction\nLet p be an odd prime and S a finite p-group. An open question in the theory\nof p-local finite groups asks whether there is a unique centric linking system\nassociated to every fusion system (see the survey article [4] by Broto, Levi and\nOliver). Bob Oliver derived in [13] a purely group-theoretic conjecture which\nwould imply existence and uniqueness of the linking system, at least at odd\nprimes. He constructed a characteristic subgroup X(S), and conjectured that\nit always contains the Thompson subgroup J(S) generated by the elementary\nabelian subgroups of greatest rank. The first two authors and M. Lilienthal\nstudied Oliver\u2019s conjecture in [8] and recast it as a question about the quotient\ngroup G = S\/X(S).\nIn this paper we shall use methods from the area of finite group theory known\nas Thompson factorization (see \u00a732 in Aschbacher\u2019s book [2]) to study the prop-\nerties of certain faithful FpG-modules which arise in this reformulation of Oliver\u2019s\nconjecture. This allows us to prove the conjecture for a wide variety of quotient\ngroups G. Our main result is as follows:\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose that p is an odd prime and S is a p-group such that\nS\/X(S) satisfies any of the following conditions\n(1) its (nilpotence) class is at most four;\n(2) it is metabelian;\n(3) it is of maximal class;\nDate: 24 January 2009.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Alperin showed that every regular 3-group is metabelian [1]. So Oliver\u2019s\nconjecture also holds if S\/X(S) is a regular 3-group.\nRemark. Every p-group G does indeed occur as such a quotient G = S\/X(S), by\nLemma 2.3 of [8]. A computation using GAP [6] shows that the iterated wreath\nproduct group G = C3 o C3 o C3 satisfies none of the above conditions. This\ngroup has order 313 and class 9, so it is neither class \u2264 4 or maximal class. The\nderived subgroup has class 3, so it is not metabelian. And the \u201cdouble diagonal\u201d\nsubgroup shows that the rank is at least 9.\nTheorem 1.1 follows by translating the following two module-theoretic results\nback into the original language of Oliver\u2019s conjecture. The notions of \u201cquadratic\nelement\u201d and \u201cF -module\u201d are recalled in \u00a72 and \u00a74, respectively.\nTheorem 1.2. Suppose that G is a p-group and V is a faithful FpG-module such\nthat \u21261(Z(G)) has no quadratic elements. If G satisfies either of the following\nconditions\n(1) G has class at most four;\n(2) G is metabelian;\nthen V cannot be an F -module.\nNotice that the assumption that there are no quadratic elements in \u21261(Z(G))\nimplies that the prime p has to be odd. Recall now that the rank of an elementary\nabelian p-group is its dimension as Fp-vector space, and that the p-rank of a finite\ngroup is the maximum of the ranks of its elementary abelian p-subgroups.\nTheorem 1.3. Suppose that p is an odd prime, that G is a p-group, and that V\nis a faithful FpG-module such that every non-identity element of \u21261(Z(G)) acts\nwith minimal polynomial Xp \u2212 1. If G satisfies either of the following conditions\n(1) G is of maximal class;\n(2) the p-rank of G is at most p;\nthen V cannot be an F -module.\nA key step in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is the following result. We recall the term\n\u201coffender\u201d in \u00a74 below.\nTheorem 1.4. Let G be a p-group and V a faithful FpG-module such that there\nare no quadratic elements in \u21261(Z(G)).\n(1) If A is an abelian normal subgroup of G, then A does not contain any\noffender.\n(2) Suppose that E is an offender. Then [G\u2032, E] 6= 1.\nON OLIVER\u2019S p-GROUP CONJECTURE: II 3\nProof of Theorem 1.1. The condition in Theorem 1.3 on the minimal polynomial\nof each non-identity element of \u21261(Z(G)) is condition (PS) of [8]. Since p > 2,\nthis condition implies that there are no quadratic elements in \u21261(Z(G)). Now\ncombine our Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 with Theorem 1.2 of [8]. \u00a4\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Theorem 5.2 deals with the case of class at most four, and\nTheorem 6.2 treats the metabelian case. \u00a4\nProof of Theorem 1.3. Theorem 8.1 handles the case p-rank(G) \u2264 p. Lemma 7.1\nshows that groups of maximal class have p-rank at most p. \u00a4\nFor sake of completeness, we remind the reader that the Oliver subgroup X(S) is\nthe largest normal subgroup of S that has a Q-series; that is, there are an integer\nn \u2265 1 and a series 1 = Q0 \u2264 Q1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Qn = X(S) of normal subgroups Qi of\nS and such that [\u21261(CS(Qi\u22121)), Qi; p\u2212 1] = 1, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nStructure of the paper In \u00a72 we comment on a few commutator relations in a\nsemidirect product and introduce some handy notation for these. In the short \u00a73\nwe recall a lemma of Meierfrankenfeld and Stellmacher. We prove Theorem 1.4\nin \u00a74, after recalling Timmesfeld\u2019s replacement theorem. In \u00a75 we derive a result\n(Lemma 5.1) about offenders and central series and apply this to the case of class\nat most four. We treat the metabelian case in \u00a76, and show in \u00a77 that every\ngroup of maximal class has p-rank at most p. Finally, \u00a78 is concerned with the\ncase of a finite p-group of p-rank at most p of Theorem 1.3.\n2. Two notational conventions\nThroughout the paper, G denotes a finite p-group, for an odd prime p. We\nadopt the usual notation and conventions from the group theory literature (see\nfor example [5]). In addition, if V is a right FpG-module, we also view V as an\nelementary abelian p-group, written additively, and form the semidirect product\n\u0393 := Gn V , with V the normal subgroup. The group multiplication in \u0393 is\n(g, v)(h,w) = (gh, v \u2217 h+ w) ,\nwhere we use \u2217 to denote the module action of FpG on V .\nOur second convention regards the commutators. For any a, b \u2208 G, we set\n[a, b] := a\u22121b\u22121ab and [a1, a2, . . . , an+1] = [[a1, . . . , an], an+1] .\nInductively, we define [a, b; 1] = [a, b] and [a, b;n] = [[a, b;n\u2212 1], b], for all n \u2265 2.\nIn particular, g \u2208 G identifies with (g, 0) \u2208 \u0393 and v \u2208 V with (1, v) \u2208 \u0393. Hence,\nthe commutator [v, g] can be written as\n[(1, v), (g, 0)] = (1,\u2212v)(g\u22121, 0)(1, v)(g, 0)\n= (1,\u2212v)(1, v \u2217 g) = (1, v \u2217 g \u2212 v) = (1, v \u2217 (g \u2212 1)) .\nThat is,\n[v, g] = v \u2217 (g \u2212 1) . (1)\n4 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\nIn particular, [v, gp] = v \u2217 (gp \u2212 1) = v \u2217 (g \u2212 1)p = [v, g; p], and so\n[v, gp] = [v, g; p] . (2)\nBy identifying G and V with the corresponding subgroups of \u0393, one obtains\nCV (H) = {v \u2208 V | \u2200h \u2208 H v \u2217 h = v} = V H\nfor a subgroup H \u2264 G, and\nCG(V ) = {g \u2208 G | \u2200v \u2208 V v \u2217 g = v} E G .\nNote that the FpG-module V is faithful if and only if CG(V ) = 1. In this paper\nwe will only be interested in faithful modules.\nDefinition. Let G be a p-group and V a faithful FpG-module. A non identity\nelement g \u2208 G is called quadratic on V if [V, g, g] = 0. If there is no confusion\nfor V , we simply say that g is quadratic. Since [V, gp] = [V, g; p], faithfulness\nimplies that quadratic elements must have order p.\n3. A lemma of Meierfrankenfeld and Stellmacher\nDefinition ([12] 2.3). Let G be a finite group and V a faithful FpG-module. For\na subgroup H \u2264 G one sets\njH(V ) :=\n|H| |CV (H)|\n|V | \u2208 Q .\nNote that j1(V ) = 1.\nLemma 3.1 (Lemma 2.6 of [12]). Let A be an abelian group and V a faithful\nFpA-module. Let H,K be two subgroups of A. Then\njHK(V )jH\u2229K(V ) \u2265 jH(V )jK(V ) ,\nwith equality if and only if CV (H \u2229K) = CV (H) + CV (K).\nProof. Since \u3008H,K\u3009 = HK, we have an equality CV (HK) = CV (H) \u2229 CV (K).\nIn addition, CV (H \u2229K) \u2287 CV (H) + CV (K). Therefore,\njHK(V )jH\u2229K(V ) =\n|HK||CV (HK)||H\u2229K||CV (H\u2229K)|\n|V |2 \u2265\n\u2265 |HK||H\u2229K||CV (H)||CV (K)||V |2 = jH(V )jK(V ) ,\nbecause |HK| |H \u2229K| = |H| |K|. \u00a4\n4. Offenders and abelian normal subgroups\nNotation. Let G be a finite group and p a fixed prime number. We denote by\nE (G) the poset of non-trivial elementary abelian p-subgroups of G.\nON OLIVER\u2019S p-GROUP CONJECTURE: II 5\nDefinition ([7] 26.5). Let G be a finite group and V a faithful FpG-module. A\nsubgroup E \u2208 E (G) is an offender of G on V if jE(V ) \u2265 1. If there is no confusion\non G and V , we simply say that E is an offender . If V has an offender, then V\nis called an F -module. An offender E is quadratic on V (or simply quadratic) if\n[V,E,E] = 0. Define\nP(G, V ) := {E \u2264 G | E \u2208 E (G) and jE(V ) \u2265 jF (V ) \u2200 1 \u2264 F \u2264 E} .\nConsequently every E \u2208 P(G, V ) is an offender, and every minimal1 offender\nlies in P(G, V ).\nNote that V is an F -module if and only ifP(G, V ) is nonempty. The subgroups\nin P(G, V ) are sometimes called best offenders.\nWe shall assume that the reader is familiar with Chermak\u2019s treatment [5] of\nTimmesfeld\u2019s replacement theorem [14].\nLemma 4.1. Let V be a faithful FpG-module and E \u2208 P(G, V ). Then there is\na quadratic offender F \u2208P(G, V ) which satisfies jF (V ) = jE(V ) and F \u2264 E.\nProof. This is Timmesfeld\u2019s replacement theorem ([5, Theorem 2]), applied with\nF = CE([V,E]). The construction of F implies [V, F, F ] = 0. \u00a4\nRemark. Note that Timmesfeld\u2019s replacement theorem also gives the decomposi-\ntion CV (F ) = [V,E] + CV (E) .\nLemma 4.2. Let G be a p-group and V a faithful FpG-module such that there\nare no quadratic elements in \u21261(Z(G)). Then E \u2229 Z(G) = 1 for every quadratic\noffender E. In particular, a quadratic offender does not contain any non-trivial\nnormal subgroup of G.\nProof. Let E be a quadratic offender. We have E \u2229Z(G) = E \u2229\u21261(Z(G)). Now,\nevery non-trivial element of E is quadratic, whereas no element of \u21261(Z(G))\nis. Hence, E \u2229 Z(G) = 1. The last statement follows from the fact that every\nnon-trivial normal subgroup meets Z(G). \u00a4\nWe are now ready to show Theorem 1.4.\nProof of Theorem 1.4. We first show the implication (1) \u21d2 (2). Let E be an\noffender. Then Z(G\u2032E) is an abelian normal subgroup of G, since G\u2032E E G. By\npart (1), this means that E \u0002 Z(G\u2032E). Since E is abelian, this can only happen\nif [G\u2032, E] 6= 1.\nFor part (1), suppose that A does contain an offender E. Note that E lies\nin the elementary abelian subgroup C := \u21261(A). Of course, V is faithful as an\nFpC-module. Set\nj0 := max{jE(V ) | E \u2208 E (C)}\n1That is, a minimal element of the set of offenders, partially ordered by inclusion.\n6 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\nChoose E \u2208 E (C) with jE(V ) = j0. Note that every such E lies inP(G, V ). By\nLemma 4.1 we may assume that E is quadratic. Among the quadratic offenders\nin A (and hence in C) with jE(V ) = j0, let us pick E of minimal order. We claim\nthat E is a T.I. subgroup of G, that is E \u2229Eg = 1, for all g \u2208 G\u2212NG(E). Note\nthat since C is normal in G, then all the G-conjugates of E lie in C. Observe\nalso that E lies in M (C, V ), in the terminology of [5, Lemma 1], since C is\nelementary abelian and we chose jE(V ) maximal. So every G-conjugate of E lies\ninM (C, V ). By Lemma 1 of [5], the intersection of any family of conjugates of E\nlies in M (C, V ), and hence, the minimality assumption on the order of E forces\nany such intersection to be trivial, whenever it is a proper subgroup of E. So E\nis a T.I. subgroup of G, as claimed.\nNow E 5 G by Lemma 4.2. Hence 1 is an intersection of conjugates of E.\nThis implies that j0 = j1(V ) = 1. Let F be a G-conjugate of E, with F 6= E,\nand hence F \u2229 E = 1, since E is a T.I. subgroup of G. Moreover, we have\nequalities jE(V ) = jF (V ) = j1(V ) = 1, and also jEF (V ) \u2264 j0 = 1, as EF \u2264 C\nis elementary abelian. So from Lemma 3.1 we deduce that jEF (V ) = 1 and that\nV = CV (1) = CV (E) + CV (F ). So Lemma 4.3 shows that [V,E] \u2286 CV (H),\nwhere H \u2264 A is the normal closure of E in G. The same argument shows that\n[V, F ] \u2286 CV (H) for every conjugate F of E. We therefore deduce that\n[V,H] \u2286 CV (H) . (3)\nNow, H \u2208 E (C), since E \u2208 E (C) and C is a normal elementary abelian subgroup\nof G. So H is itself a quadratic offender, by Eqn. (3). But H is also normal in G,\nso H contradicts Lemma 4.2. \u00a4\nLemma 4.3. Let A be an abelian subgroup of a p-group G such that [A,B] = 1\nfor every G-conjugate B of A. Let V be an FpG-module such that [V,A,A] = 0\nand V = CV (A)+CV (B) for every conjugate B 6= A of A. Then [V,A] \u2264 CV (H),\nwhere H is the normal closure of A in G.\nProof. It suffices to show that [V,A] \u2264 CV (B) for every G-conjugate B of A, since\nCV (H) is the intersection of all the CV (B). For B = A, we have [V,A,A] = 0,\nby assumption. For B 6= A, let v \u2208 V , a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B. By hypothesis, there is\na decomposition v = u+ w with u \u2208 CV (A) and w \u2208 CV (B). Thus,\n[v, a, b] = [u, a, b] + [w, a, b] = [w, a, b] = w \u2217 (a\u2212 1)(b\u2212 1) = w \u2217 (b\u2212 1)(a\u2212 1) ,\nand so [v, a, b] = [w, b, a] = 0, as was left to be shown. \u00a4\n5. Central series\nRecall the following terminology. Given a finite group G, the ascending central\nseries is defined inductively by Z0(G) = 1 and Zr+1(G) is the normal subgroup\nof G containing Zr(G) and such that Zr+1(G)\/Zr(G) = Z(G\/Zr(G)), for all\nr \u2265 1. The descending central series is given by K1(G) = G and inductively\nKr+1(G) = [Kr(G), G], for all r \u2265 1. The class n of G is the smallest number\nON OLIVER\u2019S p-GROUP CONJECTURE: II 7\nsuch that Zn(G) = G. This is also the smallest number such that Kn+1(G) = 1.\nNote that if the class is n, then\nKn+1\u2212r(G) \u2264 Zr(G) (0 \u2264 r \u2264 n). (4)\nFurther details are given in [9, III.1], or also [2, (8.7)], where Kr(G) is denoted\nby Lr(G). From the Three Subgroups Lemma ([2, (8.7)]), we have\n[Kr(G), Ks(G)] \u2264 Kr+s(G) . (5)\nWe shall make repeated use of the following lemma from [8]:\n[8], Lemma 4.1. Suppose that p is an odd prime, that G 6= 1\nis a finite p-group, and that V is a faithful FpG-module. Suppose\nthat A,B \u2208 G are such that C := [A,B] is a non-trivial element\nof CG(A,B). If C is non-quadratic, then so are A and B.\nLemma 5.1. Let G be a p-group of class n, let V be a faithful FpG-module,\nand suppose that E is a quadratic offender. If 2r \u2265 n and Kr+1(G) contains no\nquadratic elements, then\n[Kr(G), E] = 1 .\nIn particular if n \u2265 4 and there are no quadratic elements in \u21261(Z(G)), then\n[Kn\u22122(G), E] = 1 .\nRemark. The last part has no meaning for n \u2264 2, and the example discussed in\n[8, \u00a75] shows that it is false for n = 3.\nProof. We prove the first part by induction, starting with r = n and working\ndownwards. We have [Kn(G), E] \u2264 Kn+1(G) = 1, by Equation (5), and so the\nclaim holds for r = n. Now, let n\n2\n\u2264 r < n and suppose that [Kr+1(G), E] = 1. If\n[Kr(G), E] 6= 1, then there are a \u2208 Kr(G) and e \u2208 E with c := [a, e] 6= 1. Since\nc \u2208 Kr+1(G), we have [c, a] \u2208 [Kr+1(G), Kr(G)] \u2264 K2r+1(G) \u2264 Kn+1(G) = 1.\nMoreover, [c, e] = 1 since c \u2208 Kr+1(G) and the inductive hypothesis states that\n[Kr+1(G), E] = 1. In other words, we have 1 6= c = [a, e] with e quadratic and\n[c, a] = [c, e] = 1. But then, [8, Lemma 4.1] says that c is quadratic, which\ncontradicts the assumption that no quadratic element lies in Kr+1(G).\nFor the second part, if n \u2265 4, we have 2r \u2265 n for r = n\u2212 2. So, it is enough to\nshow that Kn\u22121(G) contains no quadratic element. As recalled above, there is an\ninclusion Kn\u22121(G) \u2264 Z2(G). By [8, Lemma 4.1], since \u21261(Z(G)) does not contain\nany quadratic elements, there are no quadratic elements in Z2(G) either. \u00a4\nTheorem 5.2. Suppose that G is a p-group and V is a faithful FpG-module\nsuch that \u21261(Z(G)) has no quadratic elements. If G has class at most four then\nV cannot be an F -module.\nProof. Recall that V is an F -module if and only if P(G, V ) is not empty. By\ndefinition of P(G, V ), every offender contains an element of P(G, V ), and by\n8 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\nTimmesfeld\u2019s replacement theorem (Lemma 4.1), every offender contains a qua-\ndratic offender which lies in P(G, V ). It therefore suffices to prove that there\nare no quadratic offenders. Let E \u2208 E (G). From part (2) of Theorem 1.4, we\nhave [G\u2032, E] 6= 1 if E is a quadratic offender.\nIf G has class three or less, then [G\u2032, E] \u2264 Z(G). Since \u21261(Z(G)) contains\nno quadratic elements, neither does the setwise commutator [G\u2032, E]. Thus, [8,\nLemma 4.1] shows that E is not a quadratic offender.\nNow assume the class is four. In this case we have G\u2032 = K2(G) = K4\u22122(G)\nand so [G\u2032, E] = 1 by Lemma 5.1. So, E is not a quadratic offender. \u00a4\n6. Metabelian groups\nRecall that a group is metabelian if and only if its derived subgroup is abelian.\nIn this section we will need the following well-known result:\nLemma 6.1. Suppose that G is a finite group and that A is an abelian normal\nsubgroup such that G\/A is cyclic, generated by the coset xA of x \u2208 G. Then\nG\u2032 = {[a, x] | a \u2208 A}.\nProof. This is Lemma 4.6 of Isaacs\u2019 book [10], or more precisely the equality\n\u03b8(A) = G\u2032 in the proof. It is also Aufgabe 2 a) on p. 259 of Huppert\u2019s book [9]. \u00a4\nTheorem 6.2. Suppose that G is a p-group and V is a faithful FpG-module such\nthat \u21261(Z(G)) has no quadratic elements. If the derived subgroup G\n\u2032 is abelian,\nthen V cannot be an F -module.\nProof. As noted in the proof of Theorem 5.2, if V is an F -module then there is\na quadratic offender E. From Part (2) of Theorem 1.4, we then have [G\u2032, E] 6= 1.\nSo, there is an a \u2208 E with [G\u2032, a] 6= 1. The subgroup K := G\u2032\u3008a\u3009 of G is\na non-abelian normal subgroup of G. In particular, K \u2032 \u2229 \u21261(Z(G)) > 1. Let\nc \u2208 K \u2032 \u2229\u21261(Z(G)) be a non-identity element. By Lemma 6.1 there is an element\nb \u2208 G\u2032 with c = [b, a]. So c must be quadratic by [8, Lemma 4.1], since a is\nquadratic and c is central. But that cannot be, for c lies in \u21261(Z(G)) and is\ntherefore non-quadratic by assumption. \u00a4\nCorollary 6.3. Suppose that G is a p-group and V is a faithful FpG-module such\nthat \u21261(Z(G)) has no quadratic elements. Suppose that G has an abelian normal\nsubgroup A E G such that G\/A is abelian too. Then V cannot be an F -module.\nProof. As G\/A is abelian, we have G\u2032 \u2264 A and hence G\u2032 is abelian. \u00a4\n7. Maximal class\nLemma 7.1. Let G be a finite p-group of maximal class. Then the p-rank of G\nis at most p. Moreover, if p is odd, only the wreath product Cp oCp has p-rank p.\nON OLIVER\u2019S p-GROUP CONJECTURE: II 9\nRemark. This fact does not appear to be generally known. However, we believe\nthat it is remarked in passing by Berkovich [3].\nLet us also point out that the definition of p-groups of maximal class may vary.\nIndeed, in [9], Huppert allows abelian groups of order p2 to be of maximal class,\nwhereas in [11] Leedham-Green and McKay stipulate that groups of maximal\nclass have order at least p4. We follow Huppert\u2019s conventions.\nProof. Let G be a finite p-group of order pn and maximal class n \u2212 1. First we\nconsider the small cases with n \u2264 p+1. An abelian group of order p2 has p-rank\nat most two. A nonabelian group of order 8 can have 2-rank at most two. If\np is odd and G is nonabelian with an elementary abelian subgroup of rank p,\nthen its order must be at least pp+1. So to finish off the cases with n \u2264 p + 1,\nwe just need to consider the case where p is odd, n = p + 1 and G contains an\nelementary abelian subgroup V of rank p. As G is not abelian, the p-rank of\nG is p. As V has index p in G, it is normal and the factor group G\/V has order\np. Since G has class p, the group G\/V acts on V as one (p \u00d7 p)-Jordan block\nwith eigenvalue 1. Let a \u2208 G \\ V . Then, a acts on V with minimal polynomial\n(x\u22121)p and G = \u3008V, a\u3009. Note that ap \u2208 V lies in the one-dimensional eigenspace,\ni.e. the center Z(G) of G. So replacing a by ab for a suitably chosen element\nb of the set-theoretic difference V \\ [V, a], we may assume that ap = 1. Hence the\nextension splits, and G is isomorphic to the wreath product Cp o Cp.\nFrom now on we assume that |G| = pn with n \u2265 p + 2, and we appeal to the\nfollowing results of [9, III]. By 14.16 Satz, we have that G1 = CG(K2(G)\/K4(G))\nis regular, and that |G1 : f1(G1)| = pp\u22121, and so, by 10.7 Satz, |\u21261(G)| = pp\u22121.\nThus, if G contains an elementary abelian subgroup V of rank p, then V contains\nsome g \u2208 G\\G1. It is hence enough to show that no element of order p in G\\G1\nhas a centralizer of p-rank greater than p \u2212 1. By 14.6 Hauptsatz b), G is not\nexceptional, as n \u2265 p+2. Recall that by 14.5 Definition, exceptional groups arise\nfor n \u2265 5, whence this result is relevant only for n \u2265 p + 2 and for p odd. Now,\nwe apply 14.13 Hilfsatz b), which states that if g \u2208 G \\ G1, then |CG(g)| = p2.\nConsequently, G has at most rank p\u2212 1. \u00a4\n8. Rank p\nTheorem 8.1. Suppose that p is odd, that G is a p-group, and that V is a faithful\nFpG-module such that every non-identity element of \u21261(Z(G)) acts with minimal\npolynomial Xp\u22121. If the p-rank of G is at most p, then V cannot be an F -module.\nRecall that the condition that every element of \u21261(Z(G)) acts with minimal\npolynomial Xp \u2212 1 is condition (PS) of [8].\nProof. Suppose that V is an F -module. By Lemma 4.1, P(G, V ) contains a\nquadratic offender E. Since E \u2229 Z(G) = 1 and G has rank p, the rank of E can\nbe at most p\u22121. So by Lemma 8.2 below, the rank of E is exactly p\u22121. Moreover,\nthe normal closure F of E in NG(NG(E)) is elementary abelian of rank p, since\n10 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\nit is strictly larger than E. Pick h \u2208 NG(NG(E)) \\ NG(E). Then Eh 6= E, so\nF = \u3008E,Eh\u3009. Moreover E \u2229 Eh must have size at least pp\u22122 and is therefore\nnontrivial. Pick 1 6= c \u2208 Eh \u2229 E. By Lemma 8.2 Eqn. (6), this means that\nCV (E) = CV (c) = CV (E\nh) and therefore CV (F ) = CV (E). So given that jE(V ) =\n1, the definition of jF means that jF (V ) = p. But this contradicts Timmesfeld\u2019s\nreplacement theorem (Lemma 4.1), as there is no quadratic offender H with\njH(V ) = p. \u00a4\nLemma 8.2. Suppose that p is odd, that G is a p-group, and that V is a faithful\nFpG-module such that every non-identity element of \u21261(Z(G)) acts with minimal\npolynomial Xp \u2212 1.\n(1) If E \u2208 E (G) is an offender, then its rank is at least p\u2212 1.\n(2) If E \u2208 E (G) is a rank p\u2212 1 offender, then E is a quadratic offender and\nlies in P(G, V ). Moreover, jE(V ) = 1; we have\nCV (g) = CV (E) for every 1 6= g \u2208 E; (6)\nand the normal closure F of E in NG(NG(E)) is elementary abelian with\nF > E.\nProof. Every offender contains an element of P(G, V ), which in turn contains a\nquadratic offender. So minimal elements of the poset of offenders are quadratic\nand lie inP(G, V ). So it is enough to consider the case of a quadratic offender E.\nFor all g \u2208 E the subspace CV (g) of V is Z(G)-invariant: if z \u2208 Z(G) and\nv \u2208 CV (g) then\n[v \u2217 z, g] = v \u2217 z \u2217 (g \u2212 1) = v \u2217 (g \u2212 1) \u2217 z = 0 .\nNow choose a non-identity element g \u2208 E, and let i be the smallest integer such\nthat [V, Z(G); i] \u2286 CV (g). We claim that [V, Z(G); i] \u2286 CV (gh) for every h \u2208 G.\nTo see this, note that [V, Z(G); i] is an invariant subspace of V , and therefore\n[V, Z(G); i] \u2217 h\u22121 = [V, Z(G); i]. Hence\n[[V, Z(G); i], gh] = [V, Z(G); i] \u2217 h\u22121 \u2217 (g \u2212 1) \u2217 h = [V, Z(G); i] \u2217 (g \u2212 1) \u2217 h = 0 .\nThis means that [V, Z(G); i] \u2286 CV (H), where H is the normal closure of \u3008g\u3009 in G.\nSo H\u2229\u21261(Z(G)) 6= 1, and for any z \u2208 H\u2229\u21261(Z(G)) we have that [V, z; i+1] = 0.\nThe minimal polynomial assumption on \u21261(Z(G)) therefore implies that i+1 \u2265 p:\nand so the definition of i means that |V : CV (g)| \u2265 pp\u22121. As CV (E) \u2286 CV (g), it\nfollows that |V : CV (E)| \u2265 pp\u22121. But |E| = jE(V ) |V : CV (E)|, and jE(V ) \u2265 1\nsince E is an offender. This proves the first part.\nSecond part: If E is a rank p \u2212 1 offender, then it is minimal in the poset of\noffenders, therefore quadratic and a member of P(G, V ). The proof of the first\npart shows Eqn. (6). It also shows that jE(V ) = 1 and that |V : CV (E)| = pp\u22121.\nSet N = NG(E). Observe that NG(N) > N , since E 5 G by Lemma 4.2. This\nshows that F > E. Pick g, h \u2208 NG(N) with Ng 6= Nh. Then Eg, Eh \u2264 N ; and as\nNG(E\ng) = NG(E)\ng = N , we see that Eg, Eh normalize each other. If they always\nON OLIVER\u2019S p-GROUP CONJECTURE: II 11\ncentralize each other, then F is indeed elementary abelian, since it is generated\nby all such Eg. So suppose a \u2208 Eg, b \u2208 Eh have nontrivial commutator c = [a, b].\nAs Eg, Eh normalize each other, we have c \u2208 Eg\u2229Eh. Since Eg, Eh are rank p\u22121\noffenders, it follows by Eqn. (6) that CV (a) = CV (c) = CV (b). So [a, b] = 1 by\nLemma 8.3 below, a contradiction. \u00a4\nLemma 8.3. Let G be a p-group and V is a faithful FpG-module. Suppose that\na, b \u2208 G satisfy either of the following conditions:\n(1) a, b are quadratic, and CV (a) = CV (b); or\n(2) [V, a] \u2286 CV (b) and [V, b] \u2286 CV (a).\nThen [a, b] = 1.\nProof. Recall that [V, a] \u2286 CV (a), for any quadratic element a \u2208 G. So [V, a] \u2286\nCV (b) and [V, b] \u2286 CV (a) do hold if a, b are quadratic and have the same central-\nizer in V . That is, the first case is a consequence of the second one.\nIn the second case we have [V, a, b] = [V, b, a] = 0, using additive notation in\nthe FpG-module V . Hence, a routine computation yields [V, [a, b]] = 0. Since V\nis faithful, we deduce that [a, b] = 1, as claimed. \u00a4\nReferences\n[1] J. L. Alperin. On a special class of regular p-groups. Trans.
