Computer modeling has aided optimization of the \ndie.  \nIntroduction \nThixoforming is the shaping of metal alloys in the semi-solid state. The process was developed \nfrom studies into the flow properties of metallic alloy slurries at MIT (as reviewed in [1]). The \nprocess requires that the alloys be treated so that they possess a non-dendritic, spheroidal \nmicrostructure when reheated to between the solidus and liquidus. Spheroidal semi-solid alloys are \nthixotropic; when the billet is placed into the shot sleeve of a pressure die casting (or similar) \nmachine, the shearing action during the shot causes the metal slurry to thin sufficiently for die \nfilling to be achieved. \nThere are several methods of obtaining the spheroidal microstructure. Here, two different routes are \nused: electromagnetic (MHD) stirring (Pechiney A390 alloy) and casting followed by extrusion in \nthe semi-solid state (Showa A390 alloy). This latter route involves recrystallisation and partial \nmelting and is termed the RAP route [2].  \nThixoforming has the potential to make possible the mass production of aluminium-high silicon \npistons (initially ~17% Si by weight). This alloy is less dense and has a lower thermal expansion \ncoefficient than gravity die cast pistons which are based on an alloy with the eutectic silicon content \nof ~13%. Gravity die casting of hypereutectic alloys is difficult because: the melt temperature has \nto be significantly higher than for a eutectic alloy (~750\u02daC vs. ~650\u02daC) leading to die attrition and \ncoarse silicon particles in the microstructure; there is a tendency for hypereutectic silicon to \nsegregate especially in the thick sections of the castings; it is necessary to add a P refiner to the melt \nto ensure the Si assumes an equiaxed shape, rather than solidifying as plates \u2013 this effect can fade \n \n \n \nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of the piston die. Vertical section \nthrough plane with piston pin holes. The metal slurry is \nshown as dark shading and the biscuit is removed after \nforming. \nFig. 2 Die components.

Forging pistons also \npresents difficulties with high-silicon alloys because of the hardness of the material and difficulties \nwith re-entrant surfaces. We have therefore investigated the possibility of thixoforming pistons \nfrom Al-high Si alloys. Some other reports on semisolid processing pistons are given in the \nliterature [3-7]. \nExperimental Method \nThixoformer. The material was thixoformed on the University of Sheffield press [8]. This is a \nvertical upwards acting machine with induction heating (with a medium frequency generator) \noccurring in the press itself, which means that the cylindrical slugs of alloy do not require transfer \nto the press while semi-molten. (This method would not be employed in a commercial press \nbecause slug heating takes at least 6 minutes. A heating station would be used, programmed to \ndeliver slugs in the right condition, as the press requires them. Commercial cycle times are typically \n45s. For small pistons, several components can be made in one shot). The ram velocity profile \nduring die filling, the final force and the time for which the force is applied are controlled using \ndedicated software. \nMaterial. The material was A390 alloy (Al17%Si5%Cu0.5%Mg) in two conditions: \nmagnetohydrodynamically (MHD) stirred material from Pechiney (maximum Si particle size ~60 \n\u03bcm); cast and extruded by Showa in Japan (Si particle size, made on laboratory equipment, ~80 \u00b5m, \nsmaller particle sizes are known to be available when the material is made on a commercial scale). \n \nDie. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the die \ndesign and Fig. 2 a photograph. It was decided to thixoform into the crown end of the piston (rather \nthan the side) as the die would be less complicated and costly and there would be less wastage due \nto runners and overflows. The die was manufactured from a high quality, high temperature tool \nsteel and consisted of: 1) An outer cylinder, the lower portion of which was the die entrance, \ndesigned to be larger than the maximum size of billet required; 2) Two \u2018cheeks\u2019, machined to the \nshape of the outside of the piston - these slid into the upper part of the outer cylinder (later in the \nproject, the cheeks were modified so that the gudgeon pin holes were formed in situ - this is shown \nin Fig. 1 by the dotted line inserts); 3) A disc (ingate) at the die entrance, to force the semi-solid \nmetal slurry in the required direction during die filling - like the \u2018cheeks\u2019, this was split to ease \nremoval of the component; 4) The die core, the top of which fitted closely into the \u2018cheeks\u2019 - this \nformed the internal surface of the piston and had the overflows machined into it. The die was heated \nwith a band heater strapped onto the outer cylindrical surface. The temperature used was 300-\n370\u02daC. The hot die was insulated from the press with ceramic plates. After initial trials, some \n \n \n \nFig. 3 Flow3d model showing swirling in thick sections of piston at 1 \nPas (left) but not at 40 Pas (right). In all the modelling, the flow \ndirection is left to right \nmodifications were made: draught  angles were added to the core to aid removal; the gating plates \nwere bolted to the die \u2018cheeks\u2019, making them easier to release from the thixoformed piston; the die \nentrance diameter was enlarged from 65 to 70 mm, increasing the gap between the entrance wall \nand the semi-solid slug; the ingate was redesigned into an elliptical shape so that it was wider and \nflared towards the component; redesign of the overflow wells facilitated removal of overflowed \nalloy. \nModelling. Die filling was modelled using the Flow3d computational fluid dynamics package \n(Flow Science Inc., USA). It was assumed the slurry was Newtonian (i.e. the viscosity was \nconstant). This was known to be a gross approximation but at the time the thixotropic behaviour \nwas not fully accounted for in Flow3d (it now is) and the Newtonian modelling did at least provide \nsome guidance on die design.  \nResults \nThe first task was to find the minimum ram velocity at which the die could be filled with the new, \nelliptical entrance. The aim was to try and reduce the defects due to swirling and folding of the \nmetal slurry, which were thought to originate from \u2018jetting\u2019 of material through the die entrance. \nThe minimum velocity was found to be 0.3 ms-1 but the large pores in the gudgeon pin boss area \nwere not eliminated. For the flow modeling, two values of the viscosity were then used, 1 Pas and \n40 Pas. The low value showed swirling in the thick sections of the piston (Fig. 3), which probably \nleads to the defects found in practice. The higher value gave the die filling force in the model which \nwas also obtained by measurement on the press and did not show the swirling. As noted above, the \nmodeling is limited by its lack of accounting for thixotropy. Therefore, from a pragmatic point of \nview, for studying the swirling, the low viscosity was used but otherwise, for examining die design, \nthe higher viscosity was considered \nappropriate.  \nRam speeds of 2.0 ms-1 and 0.3 ms-1 \nwere used in the modeling. Die \nentrance designs were based on the \nelliptical ingate and the tapered ring \nshown in Figs. 1 and 2. The findings \nwere as follows: \n\u2022 Swirling of the alloy is worse \nat low viscosities and high \nram speeds. \n\u2022 At both viscosities, the \ngudgeon pin boss fills before \nthe thin section in the plane \nat right angles to it. Creating \nan opening in the gate for this \nboss (as with the elliptical ingate in the orientation used for thixoforming), without at the \nsame time doing so for the thin section, makes this problem worse. \n\u2022 Late filling of the thin section (i.e. the skirt) means that the two flow fronts meet in this part \nof the component, increasing the likelihood of cold shuts in this part of the piston. \n\u2022 The best filling pattern was achieved with the tapered ring die entrance. However, even then \nthe gudgeon pin boss filled before the thin section of the skirt. \nSubsequent flow modeling looked at the following issues: \n\u2022 Opening up the ingate opposite the thin section of the piston, with the aim of discouraging \nthe slurry from taking the \u2018path of least resistance\u2019 into the gudgeon pin bosses. \n\u2022 Examining the effect of gating the die from the side rather than from the crown end. \n \n \n \nFig. 4 Modelled filling sequence on \u00bc \npiston showing how gudgeon pin boss \nfills later when pin hole is present \n(below). This makes the flow front more \nuniform. Greyscale colour represents \npressure (dark is low) \nFig. 5 Modelled effect of enlarging the slug. \nThe last region to solidify (dark region on the \nleft) moves from the crown (top) into the \n\u2022 Adding a hole for the gudgeon pin, with side and crown gating systems. \nThe results suggested that improved die filling would be obtained by thixoforming the pinholes in \nsitu, with the fully open gate. The indications were that \nproviding some constraint to flow in the gudgeon pin area \nwould mean that this region did not fill much more quickly \nthan the skirt; a more uniform flow front would ensue (Fig. \n4). Furthermore, having to fill a thinner section in this area \ncould reduce the swirling of the slurry. These changes \ncaused a significant improvement in the product (made at \nthis stage with the Pechiney alloy). The gross porosity in the \ngudgeon pin region was eliminated. Microstructurally, some \nregions showed a good, spheroidal microstructure but there \nwere still several problems: shrinkage porosity between the \ncrown and the core (this also occurs to a similar extent in \ngravity die cast pistons); segregation of liquid from the \nsemisolid slurry; and areas where the aluminium spheroids \nappeared elongated and aligned in the slurry flow. \nMeasures to Improve the Microstructure in the Thixo-\nformed Pistons. Several ways to reduce the crown \nshrinkage porosity were discussed. One possibility was \nincreasing the slug volume, which should make the \nshrinkage porosity move down out of the crown region of \nthe piston and into the biscuit. In practice, this did have the \ndesired effect of driving some of the porosity further into the \nbiscuit (and modelling showed this could happen \u2013 Fig. 5). \nHowever, there were still large pores in the crown. In \naddition, filling was made more difficult, possibly due to \nthe slug now being the same diameter as the die entrance \nand therefore freezing earlier. Several other possibilities \nwere considered but it was not practical to implement them \nin this project: core cooling after completion of the shot; \nfeeding from the side of the piston; using a ceramic \nmaterial to replace the tapered metal ring at the die \nentrance.  \nThere was also the issue of the Si segregation and the \nelongation or alignment of the Al spheroids mentioned \nabove. A390 was obtained from Showa in the cast and \nextruded condition to compare with the behaviour of the \nPechiney MHD alloy. It was known from a previous \nproject that the material could be thixoformed [9]. In \naddition, it was decided to model the effects of a ceramic \ningate. The results showed a more uniform temperature \ndistribution than with the metal ingate. A ring to hold \nthe ceramic moulding compound was machined, as was \na former with the same 45\u00b0 profile as the metal ingate. \nThe slug size was reduced so the biscuit did not extend \nfurther into the die entrance than this profiled ceramic ring. The biscuit would therefore not be \ncooled by the metal parts of the die.  \n \n \n \nFig. 6 Centre of crown of Pechiney alloy \npiston (top) and Showa alloy piston \n(bottom), thixoformed with ceramic ingate. \nOnly one large pore was seen in the Showa \nalloy. The Pechiney alloy had many pores.\nThixoforming trials were performed with both the Pechiney and the Showa alloys. Using the \nceramic die entrance resulted in a marked reduction in the shrinkage porosity in the crown (Fig.6). \nThe Pechiney alloy still had extensive segregation of \neutectic and of silicon, but this was not evident in \nthe Showa alloy, which also had even lower \nporosity.  \nIt is not clear why there is such a problem with \nsegregation in the Pechiney alloy. It appears to \noccur during the forming process. The non-\nspheroidal shape in places of the aluminium \nparticles could cause liquid to be pushed through \npartially entangled Al particles (see Fig. 7 left). \nEven samples thixoformed under the optimal \nconditions occasionally show folds and large pores \nwhich could result from uneven flow of liquid-rich \nand liquid-poor regions. These tend to be nearer the \nextremities of the die, which are also richer in \nliquid. In parts of the die where the shear rates are \nhigh, elongated aluminium particles have been \nobserved, aligned in the direction of the flow. The \nforces in die filling do not seem enough to actually \nelongate the particles during the process. It is \npossible that the uneven microstructure in the \nmaterial causes the segregation of the particles with \nparticularly high aspect ratio into certain regions of \nthe die. Finally, it should be noted that the Pechiney \nalloy requires more liquid to be formed during \nreheating into the semi-solid state than for the \nShowa alloy. For this reason, the use of the ceramic \ndie entrance did not totally eliminate shrinkage porosity below the crown surface.  \nThixoforming the Final Batch of Pistons. In the final series of thixoformings, 22 shots were made \nwith the Showa A390 alloy. The conditions were: ram speed 350 mm\/s, load 70 kN, die temperature \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n370\u00b0C. Six shots were radiographed. No internal porosity was found. Some examples of the \nthixoformed Showa pistons are shown in Fig. 8. \n \nFig. 7 Comparison of the aluminium grain shape in thixoformed Pechiney alloy (left) and Showa \n(right). In the latter, the microstructure is more spheroidal, probably resulting in smoother die filling \nand less segregation. \n \n \n \nFig. 8 Pistons thixoformed in the Showa A390 \nalloy. The biscuit has been machined off and \nthe components washed. Otherwise, these are \nas-thixoformed. \nSummary \nOpening up the die entrance to the full width of the crown made the flow into the die more uniform \nand helped to reduce the tendency for large pores to form due to swirling of the slurry. Die heating \nreduced the tendency for cold shuts in the skirt (thin section). Placing inserts into the die to make \nholes for the piston pins evened up the flow between the thick and the thin regions in the die (i.e. \nhaving an obstacle in the thicker regions). The massive pores experienced in the earlier shots were \neliminated. Placing a ceramic material in the die entrance considerably reduced the shrinkage \nporosity in the crown. Using the Showa alloy, made by mechanical deformation rather than MHD, \nreduced shrinkage porosity still further and eliminated macrosegregation of the eutectic liquid and \nthe silicon. \nComputer modeling has been of considerable assistance in examining the effects of potential \nchanges to the die. \n \nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Federal-Mogul (and in particular Joe Hunter) \nfor their contribution to this project.
