Drawing on a range of \nperspectives from development and postcolonial scholarship, this paper argues for \nthe creative possibility of learning between different contexts.  This involves a \nconceptualisation of learning that is at once ethical and indirect: ethical because it \ntranscends a liberal integration of subaltern knowledge, and indirect because it \ntranscends a rationalist tendency to limit learning to direct knowledge transfer \nbetween places perceived as \u201esimilar\u201f.  This challenge requires a consistent \ninterrogation of the epistemic and institutional basis and implications of the North-\nSouth divide, and an insistence on developing progressive conceptions of learning. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nI am grateful to Jon Shapiro Anjaria, Tariq Jazeel, Craig Jeffrey, Jenny Robinson, \nand to two anonymous referees for useful comments on an earlier draft of this \npaper. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nAcross the social sciences, it remains routinely common to find references to \u201ethe \nglobal South\u201f, the \u201eThird World\u201f, and even the \u201eperiphery\u201f.  We are by now familiar \nwith the arguments against such forms of categorisation, many of which have been \nspelled out in this journal (see, for instance, Berger, 1994, 2004; Dirlik, 2004; \nKamraza, 1995; Korany, 1994).  They ask, for instance, whether we can \nreasonably group Argentina, Botswana, and Iran in the same category of \ncountries, when their political, cultural, and economic circumstances are so \nsignificantly different?  And when patterns of poverty and wealth vary so greatly \neven within countries, can it make any sense to split the world into \u201eFirst\u201f and \n\u201eThird\u201f, \u201eNorth\u201f and \u201eSouth\u201f?  Others ask that given that it is increasingly accepted \nthat contemporary challenges of \u201edevelopment\u201f \u2013 such as deindustrialisation, \nregionalisation, flexibilization, migration, urban deprivation, economic structural \nchange, market failure, state restructuring, concerns with social capital and social \nexclusion, amongst other issues (Pieterse, 2001; Maxwell, 1998) - are common to \n\u201epoor\u201f and \u201erich\u201f countries, why should we choose to restrict development debates \nto either \u201eset\u201f of countries?  Ultimately, categorisation is an endless pursuit.  As \nMaxwell (1998: 25) has put it: \u201cTake any pair of societies or countries, identify \nsome differences between them, isolate those which belong to the poorer country, \nand call this the true territory of development.  But we could do this with Britain and \nBelgium, as easily as we could with Britain and Belize; and anyway, the \ncharacteristics change over time.  Does the game bring us any closer to a \u201etrue\u201f \ndefinition of a developing country?  I fear not\u201d. \n \nTo be sure, these categories have their political merit.  They have been used to \nmobilise collectives of low-income countries on issues as diverse as the non-\naligned movement, labour rights, trade and tariffs, and the environment (Dirlik, \n2004).  Writing about Africa, Ferguson (2006: 33) has argued: \u201cFor all their \nmanifold failings, the developmental narratives that have long dominated thinking \nabout Africa\u201fs place-in-the-world \u2013 narratives that explicitly rank countries from \nhigh to low, from more to less \u201edeveloped\u201f \u2013 do at least acknowledge (and promise \nto remedy) the grievances of political-economic inequality and low global status in \nrelation to other places\u201d.  For all that, they have also been acutely fractured \ncategories.  Witness, for instance, the divisive oil politics of OPEC.  And with the \n\u201ewar on terror\u201f shaping the contemporary geopolitical horizon, we might detect the \nemergence of a conservative neo-Third Worldism that shelters state violence in \n 4 \ncountries including Indonesia or India, and that retains little of the progressive \ncollectivist politics of the 1950s and 1960s (Hadiz, 2004).  If, as political labels, \nthese categories are problematic, it is also the case that different forms of global \nsolidarity are emerging.  Indeed, Olesen (2004), using the example of the \nZapatistas and pointing to other social movements (see, for instance, Keck and \nSikkink, 1998), suggests, somewhat hopefully, that modes of global solidarity are \nshifting from the one-sided solidarity of Third Worldism through which there was a \nclear distinction between the (state) providers and beneficiaries of solidarity, to a \nglobalised solidarity based on mutuality.  \n \nThis sort of problematising is not, of course, to deny that global inequality in \neconomic and political spheres is increasing (Ferguson, 2006; Rapley, 2001; Ould-\nMey, 2003), or to deny the simple fact that as a short-hand it makes perfect sense \nto refer to a growing divergence between \u201erich\u201f countries and \u201epoor\u201f countries.  It \ndoes force us to ask, however, as a diversity of recent commentators have done, \nwhether intellectually terms like \u201eSouth\u201f or \u201eThird World\u201f do any work?  The use of \nthese categories often seems to achieve little more than to \u201efix\u201f a country as \nimmobile and static, to tie a country into a relation of equivalence between a set of \nproblems and a category.  The implications of doing so are being increasingly \ndocumented in a variety of fields in the social sciences.   \n \nFor instance, in urban studies, Robinson (2002, 2005) argues that Euro-American \nconstructs like the \u201eglobal city\u201f or \u201eworld city\u201f theses negate the ordinary, contingent \ngeographies of contemporary cities.  In these constructs, the city is positioned in a \nhierarchy through which it is measured against, for instance, transnational \nbusiness or finance networks, in ways that obscure other aspects of city-life in \nthose cities, \u201cespecially dynamic economic activities, popular culture, innovations \nin urban governance and the creative production of diverse forms of urbanism\u201d \n(Robinson, 2002: 540).  We need only to bear in mind, for instance, that the \neconomies of cities as different as Dhaka, Khartoum, Mumbai and Seoul, are \nlargely informal (Bhowmik, 2005; Davis, 2006).  These often precarious and \nvulnerable economies may relate to forms of transnational business or finance \nnetworks, but they remain largely distinct.  Robinson builds a compelling argument \nfor an approach that seeks to abandon categories and conceptualise cities as \n\u201eordinary cities\u201f, \u201cunderstood to be diverse, creative, modern and distinctive, with \nthe possibility to imagine (within the not inconsiderable constraints of contestations \n 5 \nand uneven power relations) their own futures and distinctive forms of city-ness\u201d \n(Robinson, 2002: 546).   \n \nOn a different register, writing about Area Studies in the United States, Appadurai \n(2000) describes the insidious persistence of what he refers to as \u201etrait \ngeographies\u201f.  His argument is that much traditional thinking about \u201eareas\u201f has \nbeen \u201cdriven by conceptions of geographical, civilisational, and cultural coherence \nthat rely on some sort of trait list \u2013 of values, languages, material practices, \necological adaptations, marriage patterns, and the like\u201d (Appadurai, 2000: 7; and \nsee Spivak, 2003).  In contrast to this reductive view of areas as \u201cimmobile \naggregates of traits\u201d, he argues for a focus on \u201eprocess geographies\u201f that view \n\u201csignificant areas of human organization as precipitates of various kinds of action, \ninteraction and motion \u2013 trade, travel, pilgrimage, warfare, proselytisation, \ncolonisation, exile, and the like\u201d (Appadurai, 2000: 7).  This argument resonates \nwith the recent spate of Ford Foundation sponsored University initiatives in the US, \nlaunched in 1997 under the banner of Crossing Borders: Revitalizing Area Studies.  \nThe Foundation has a longstanding interest in Area Studies in the US that began \nin the early 1950s as part of its effort to promote democracy and poverty-reduction \noverseas.  This $25 million initiative seeks to develop new approaches to areas \nprovoked \u201cin light of a dramatically changed, and increasingly interconnected, \nworld\u201d (Ford Foundation, 1999: xi).  For example, the Institute for International \nStudies, University of California, Berkeley, won funding from the Foundation for its \nArea Studies and the New Geographies activities.  This work explores new \nrelations between areas, globalisation and social theory in a variety of contexts, \nincluding diasporic identities, multiculturalism, transnational environmentalism, \npost-communist transitions, and global-local articulations (Institute of International \nStudies, 2006).  If in Robinson we have an argument for theorising the \u201eordinary\u201f in \nways that transcend categories that fix, such as \u201eThird World city\u201f, in Appadurai we \nhave an argument for change and fluidity over immobility.  These two distinct \nexamples are indicative of a gathering momentum in the social sciences to \npluralise \u201ethe South\u201f and to reposition the heterogeneous geographies that lie \nbeneath that category as active media rather than objects of study.   \n \nNonetheless, categories like Third World or global South are active in the \nconceptual and institutional organisation of the social sciences today.  One \nimplication of the resilience of these categories is that they are active imaginative \nbarriers that militate against the possibilities of different countries to learn from one \n 6 \nanother.  If Appadurai (2000), Ferguson (2006) and Robinson (2002) are \nconcerned principally with the need to rethink areas and categories, in this paper I \nam concerned with how learning might occur across a North-South divide.  \nInevitably, this requires a degree of critical reflection on what labels like North and \nSouth do.  If agents working on issues as diverse as, for instance, urban \ndevelopment, welfare provision, or conflict resolution, wish to draw on examples \nfrom different places, it is generally countries considered \u201elike-minded\u201f or to share \nsimilar values that are invoked.  This extends beyond the academy to realms such \nas policy-making.  In the case of the UK, for instance, policy-makers appear almost \ninstinctively to look to countries such as Canada, New Zealand and particularly the \nUSA when attempting to draw lessons about policy.  These are countries where, \nas the political scientist Richard Rose (1991) has argued, policy makers perceive \n\u201ecommon values\u201f (for example, of a capitalist democracy, or a similar culture) to be \nconstant: \u201cElected officials searching for lessons prefer to turn to those whose \noverall political values are consistent with their own\u201d (Rose, 1991: 17; 1993).   \n \nThis makes it unlikely for policy-makers interested in, for instance, EU expansion \nor federalism to think to look not just to the example of the United States but \nperhaps also to that of India, where the federal settlement has had to negotiate \nlinguistic, cultural and religious differences.  Attempting to learn only from the \n\u201eusual suspects\u201f, such as the US in relation to EU expansion, does not necessarily \ndiminish the quality of policies, but it does necessarily negate a range of \nexperience across the globe that could prove useful.  This entrenches a narrow \nrange of ideas based around particular policy networks, as Dolowitz and Marsh \n(1996: 353) put it: \u201cIf policy makers are looking to draw lessons from politics which \nare similar in institutional, economic and cultural makeup, it might be argued that, \ninstead of expanding the number of ideas and actors involved in the decision \nmaking process, policy transfer enhances the power of a relatively small circle of \nactors who consistently draw lessons from each other\u201d.   \n \nSo how might learning be conceived across a North-South divide?  While the \nrelations between knowledge, learning and development are of growing \nimportance in development (see special issue of Development in Practice, 2002; \nDFID, 2000; Hovland, 2003; K. King, 2001; McFarlane, 2006a; Parnwell, 1999; \nWilson, 2002; World Bank, 1999), there have few attempts to explore how learning \nbetween North and South might be conceived.  Much of the literature concerned \nwith development and learning has explored learning in the context of South-South \n 7 \nrather than South-North (exceptions here include Gaventa, 1999; De Haan and \nMaxwell, 1998; Slater, 1997).  In this paper I want to argue in favour of the \npossibilities of learning in the field of development between development scholars \nand practitioners working in \u201erich\u201f and \u201epoor\u201f countries.  This requires a conception \nof learning that must be critically reflexive of the power relations between different \ngroups, and that must be able to imagine the possibilities of learning between \ndifferent contexts in ways that do not conform to historical patterns of colonisation \nor to contemporary tendencies of aid-based conditionality.  I am not simply \nsuggesting here that categories like global South are solely responsible for a lack \nof engagement by, for instance, Euro-American scholars working in \u201eWestern\u201f \ncontexts with the literatures and knowledges of Africa, Asia and South America, or \nthat struggling to abandon such categories will necessarily result in some kind of \nneutral engagement or dialogue.  I do not claim that categories should be \nabandoned, as if that were possible, but join with a range of recent commentators \nwho have argued in favour of new ways of conceiving \u201eareas\u201f like Africa (see \nFerguson, 2006) or, on a different register, the South.  I am arguing for a particular \nconception of learning between different contexts that might help pluralise the \nproduction of knowledge and lead to a more globally informed social science \u2013 \ntowards an image of what Spivak (2003) has called \u201eplanetarity\u201f, or what we might \nrefer to as a more postcolonial social science. \n \nI will argue against a conception of learning that reflects a liberal understanding of \ndialogue, or that invokes difference only through an imperative towards \nhomogeneity, undermining the opportunities for learning from different places and \nfor a more informed debate about development.  This is an argument, then, for \nlearning from different places in ways that does not seek to pre-empt what those \ndifferent places might offer.  Running through this discussion is a commitment to \nlearning as a processual, provisional, and uncertain ethico-politics.  This is not to \nunderestimate the explicit and implicit hierarchies that frame conceptions and \nrelations between different places.  To invoke difference is not to naively suggest \nthat, say, Accra, London, Mumbai and Washington suddenly occupy an horizontal \nequal space.  People within and outside these disparate spaces often conceive of \na world hierarchically ranked.  As Ferguson (2006) has argued, social scientists \nmay rightly speak of coeval \u201ealternative modernities\u201f (see Gaonkar, 2001; \nGeschiere, 1997; Harootunian, 2001; Holston, 1999) in Africa or elsewhere, \nbut there is a need to be attentive to how people living in, for example, sub-\nSaharan Africa, may conceive of Africa as inferior, as a continent at the bottom \n 8 \nrank of global society, and may wish to escape to a perceived \u201ebetter life\u201f in Europe \nor America.  Hierarchical constructs cannot be straightforwardly argued away.  In \naddition, it would be foolish to pretend that all scholars are necessarily interested \nin learning from different places.  That said, my suggestion is that scholars who \nmay well be interested in this kind of engagement tend not to engage.  This is in \npart because of a lack of critical reflection both on the epistemological and \ninstitutional biases that divide (in this case) development scholarship in the North \nand South, and on the possibilities that engagement might involve. \n \nThe paper will progress by contextualising division in development debates in \nrelation to a wider imperative to separate North and South in the Euro-American \nsocial sciences.  It will argue that the failure to communicate around development \nis part of a more general tendency to differentiate between the \u201ehere\u201f and \u201ethere\u201f.  I \nwill suggest that this is more than just habit or routine: it is bound up with an \nimplicit tendency to view the South as a mix of countries where knowledge travels \nto rather than from.  Indeed, the \u201efirst here, then elsewhere\u201f (Chakrabarty, 2000) \ntendency in contemporary development practice \u2013 involving the exporting of \n\u201esolutions\u201f from the North to the South via agencies like the World Bank \u2013 still \nreflects a general tendency in the social sciences, despite recent critiques and \nalternatives.  Interrogating this tendency necessarily involves engaging the \napparatus of research itself.  For example, Robinson (2003b) writes of a \n\u201eknowledge-production industrial complex\u201f in geography that forms both the limits \nof Euro-American social science and a template for the production of parochial \nuniversalisms.  Appadurai (2000) writes of the \u201eweak internationalism\u201f that \nnecessarily follows the inflexibility of the research ethic of US Area Studies.  While \nthere is evidence of significant change \u2013 particularly in relation to Appaduria\u201fs \nclaims - these examples indicate that far from being particular to development \ndebates, the divide between those working on the North and those working on the \nSouth is rather more widespread in the social sciences, and is both \nepistemological and institutional.  The development of new conceptions of learning \nbetween different contexts, then, requires new imaginaries of research practice.  \nThe paper will draw on a range of concepts and methods from development and \npostcolonial scholarship.  In making these arguments, the paper also seeks to \ncontribute to an ongoing dialogue between development studies and postcolonial \nscholarship (Blunt and McEwan, 2002; McEwan, 2001; McEwan, 2003; McFarlane, \n2006b; Sylvester, 1999). \n \n 9 \nGeographies of knowledge production: epistemic and institutional divides \n \nFrom Rostow\u201fs (1962) influential The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-\nCommunist Manifesto - written while the Third World was the battleground of Cold \nWar superpowers - to the world-systems theory drawn on by dependency theorists \n(Baran, 1957; Frank, 1967; Amin, 1976), and to the North-South divide of the \nBrandt Commission in 1980, mainstream and alternative accounts of development \nhave carved-up global space into worlds and peripheries.  Notwithstanding the \ndifferences and nuances within and between these varied perspectives, the close \nrelationship throughout the post-war period between geopolitics and intellectual \nglobal categorisation divided the imagination of development studies and practice \nalong lines of interacting but separate blocs.  While terms like Third World and \nGlobal South are increasingly problematised and rethought to account for new \ngeographies of wealth and poverty, connection and disconnection, across divides \n(Berger, 2004; Dirlik, 2004), one implication of this categorisation has been to \nmitigate the opportunities to learn about development through examples from \nNorth and South.  Knowledge, of course, frequently travels from wealthier, more \npowerful countries in the development industry, but it generally travels one way \nand it generally travels as a \u201esolution\u201f rather than as a basis for learning (Mawdsley \net al, 2002; Ellerman, Denning, and Hanna, 2001; Ellerman, 2002).  This is not just \nan epistemic divide: it is a material and institutional one.  Let us take the example \nof development geography.  In a short commentary in 2000, Jones, lamenting a \n\u201eghettoization of theory\u201f, was able to write the following unsettling words about the \nsub-discipline and its relationship to the wider discipline: \n \nWithin Departments of Geography there are those with knowledge and expertise \nassociated mainly with Geographies of the \u201eNorth\u201f on the one hand, and the so-called \ndevelopmentalists, or those interested in the \u201eSouth\u201f, on the other.  Whilst there may be in-\nhouse links and individual exceptions, I would still maintain that each is compartmentalized, \noften dismissive or even apathetic to the other; or, as is often the case with development \ngeographers, for good reasons, very defensive of \u201etheir\u201f marginalized terrain.  This failure to \ncommunicate within our own departments, not only prevents valuable learning from either \ncontext, it also reflects the pedestrianism of academic discourse in comparison to actual \nprocesses and practices on the ground (Jones, 2000: 238). \n \nThis failure to communicate around development is part of a more general \ntendency to differentiate between the \u201ehere\u201f and \u201ethere\u201f in the social sciences, and \n 10 \nis more than just habit or routine.  I would suggest that it remains bound up with an \nimplicit tendency to view the South as a mix of countries where knowledge travels \nto rather than from, and it is underwritten by the organisation of knowledge \nproduction in the Euro-American academy.  For instance, writing about political \ngeography, but with an argument that is applicable more widely in the social \nsciences, Robinson (2003b) describes hegemonic zones of academic knowledge \nproduction that preclude more plural, internationalised forms of knowledge \ncreation.  She has argued that the material basis of this is a knowledge-production \nindustrial complex (KPIC), through which disparate geographies of publishers, \nmarkets, citation indices, and Euro-American theoretical preoccupations, reflect \nand maintain the centrality and privilege of particular academic locations.  This \ngeography of knowledge production may appear obvious, but in practice there is \nan often implicit tension between parochial and universalist epistemic claims or \nassumptions that can act to mask some of the realities of the discipline\u201fs \nsituatedness.  Robinson argues (2003b: 648):  \n \nFor through the KPIC, parochial knowledge is created in universal form.  Western feminist \nscholarship becomes \u201cfeminist geography\u201d, and theories of a few western states produce \n\u201cpolitical geographies of the state\u201d.  My hunch is that even the most general level of \nintellectual work within the discipline, i.e. dominant theorisations of space and place, are \nalso produced in a western idiom, learning little from different traditions of scholarship and \ndiverse political contexts. \n \nThe \u201efirst here, then elsewhere\u201f tendency is both epistemological and institutional, \nand is currently troubling a variety of (particularly) internationally-oriented \ndisciplines (for example, see Mufti, 2005 and Spivak, 2003 on Comparative \nLiterature).  It extends too to theoretical fields of endeavour, including for instance \nin the recent upsurge of interest in imperialism.  For example, rallying on Hardt and \nNegri\u201fs (2000) Empire, Mufti (2005: 488) is disturbed to find \u201cthe diverse regions \nand societies of the world\u201d reduced to an \u201cundifferentiated field\u201d for the elaboration \nof universalist Euro-American logic of capitalist development.  As Mufti indicates, \nHardt and Negri may have had more sensitivity to the role of the particular and the \nsubaltern in imperialism if they had engaged, for instance, with the significant \nreworking of Marxism and imperialism by the subaltern studies collective (Guha \nand Spivak, 1988; Chakrabarty, 2002).   \n \n 11 \nThe embedding of Euro-American centric forms of knowledge production in the \ninstitutional make-up of the contemporary social sciences betrays what Appadurai \n(2000) has called a \u201eweak internationalisation\u201f.  By weak internationalisation, \nAppadurai is referring to the implicit tendency to insist that the only kinds of \nknowledge that can be taken seriously by the Euro-American academy are those \nthat conform with its particular formats of writing, citation, and history.  This relates \nto the operation of established communities of judgement and accountability which \ninsist, for example, on a privileged role for a particular community of experts who \nprecede and follow any specific piece of research.  In addition, there is in many \nspecialisms a need for the author to \u201cdetach morality and political interest from \nproperly scholarly research\u201d (Appadurai, 2000: 14; Brohman, 1996; McGee, 1995; \nParnwell, 1999).  This raises a question that Appadurai (2000: 14) believes has not \nbeen sufficiently answered in US Area Studies: \u201cCan we find ways to legitimately \nengage scholarship by public intellectuals here and overseas whose work is not \nprimarily conditioned by professional criteria of criticism and dissemination?\u201d.  This \ninvolves moving beyond the assumption that overseas scholarship only be taken \nseriously if it conforms to Euro-American precepts, and developing others ways of \nimagining the internationalisation of social science research.  Interrogating the \ntendencies to separate the social sciences of a North from those of a South that \nmitigate the opportunities of learning, then, necessarily involves critically reflecting \nnot just on how those categories are conceived, but on the very apparatus of social \nscience research.  This process must be part of asking how learning might be \nconceived and take place between different contexts.   \n \nLearning from development \n \nIn this section, I want to consider learning about development from two inter-\nrelated standpoints.  The first part will consider the approach to learning in \ndevelopment studies and practice of the South, both as learning between countries \nand as learning from marginalised constituencies within countries.  I argue that the \nschism between established modes of development knowledge production and \nmore marginalised knowledges, such as those of the poor, is a product of the kind \nof weak internationalisation Appadurai (2000) talks about in reference to Area \nStudies, or that Parnwell (1999) depicts in relation to development studies.  This \ntendency can be partly addressed through dialogue between development \nscholars and postcolonial scholars, particularly through the more radical \nconception of subaltern knowledge in postcolonial work.  The argument leads to a \n 12 \nconception of learning distinct from the liberal tendency of much development \nscholarship and practice.  Second, I will consider how this more radical conception \nof learning might be developed by outlining a notion of indirect learning. \n \nLearning \u2018the South\u2019 \n \nAs I have indicated above, learning between different places is generally \nconstrained in the social sciences by the tendency of the Euro-American academy \nto gloss over that which does not conform with its own regimes of academic \nknowledge production.  In development studies and practice, despite the advent of \ndiscourses of participation and the development of research tools such as \nParticipatory Rural Appraissal (PRA) (Chambers, 1997; Holland and Blackburn, \n1998; Mohan, 2002), laudable attempts to take seriously the knowledge and \nexperience of the poor and marginalised remain often highly problematic.  As part \nof wider attempts to understand the views and experience of the poor, tools like \nPRA are to be welcomed.  But despite some real successes in democratising \ndevelopment interventions, PRA is often rigidly tied to the agendas of donors, and \ncan often be implemented in a tokenistic fashion, routinised and \u201eparcelled-in\u201f to \ndevelopment initiatives (Mohan, 2002).  In addition, while more successful PRA \nhas picked-up on, for instance, gender imbalances, local elites have sometimes \ncome to stand for \u201ethe community\u201f (ibid).  To be sure, there is a great deal of social \nscience that has engaged with marginalised knowledges in critically reflexive ways, \nparticularly in anthropology (see, for example, Ferguson, 1999; Gupta, 1998; \nHansen, 2001).  However, there remains a great deal of development studies and \npractice that integrates subaltern knowledge into particular Euro-American \npositions or predilections (Briggs and Sharp, 2004). \n \nOne method for thinking through the use of subaltern knowledge is Briggs and \nSharp\u201fs (2004) distinction between liberal and radical politics. They argue that \nthere must be a radical attempt to engage different kinds of indigenous knowledge \nand ways of knowing, rather than a liberal attempt that integrates views into pre-\ngiven positions.  In development studies in practice, however, the conception of \nlearning from \u201eothers\u201f tends to be explicitly or implicitly liberal, meaning that pre-\nestablished positions or modes of thought and representation remain dominant.  I \nwill seek to build on Briggs and Sharp\u201fs (2004) notion of radical learning through \nbrief discussion of Foucault\u201fs \u201esubjugated knowledges\u201f. \n \n 13 \nThe tendency towards liberal integration is strikingly clear when we consider the \napproach to learning embodied in the practices of powerful development agencies \nlike the World Bank.  For David Ellerman (2002: 286), former Economic Advisor to \nthe Chief Economist at the World Bank, the Bank is a \u201cdevelopment Church\u201d in \nwhich \u201cnew learning at the expense of established Official Views is not \nencouraged\u201d.  He argues that the kinds of local knowledge that can contribute to \nlearning about development are limited by an adherence in institutions like the \nWorld Bank to \u201eOfficial Views\u201f.  Writing about \u201cbranded knowledge as dogma\u201d, \nEllerman (ibid) argues: \n \nThe Church or party model fits perfectly with the standard \u201edissemination\u201f or transmission-\nbelt methodology of knowledge-based development assistance.  The agency believes it \nholds the best \u201eknowledge for development\u201f and is to transmit it to the recipients in the \ndeveloping world through various forms of aid-baited proselytisation. \n \nCoyle (2001), in her study of the World Bank and the IMF, has similarly found that \nthat multilaterals have a need to project an image of having the right answers and \nmaintaining a consensual official line.  This tendency to \u201eapply\u201f development \nsolutions is bound up with the timescale of mainstream development projects, \nwhich puts pressure on strategies to be completed in a hurried cycle of two or \nthree years (Mawdsley, et al, 2002).  Ellerman warns against the \u201cself-reinforcing \nlock-in between development agencies and their client countries\u201d (2002: 289), \nwhereby learning about problems is prevented by advice and help from a powerful \noutsider and an eagerness of local policy-makers to jump to a ready-made \nsolution.  This \u201crage to conclude\u201d often leads to an espousal of \u201einternational best \npractices\u201f \u2013 \u201ca tendency based not on any methods resembling social science but \non a bureaucratic need to maintain elite prestige by \u201ehaving an answer\u201f for the \nclient\u201d (Ellerman, 2002: 289).  Much of the World Bank\u201fs (1999) \u201eknowledge for \ndevelopment\u201f initiative to date has involved the aggregation of information and \nknowledge, a process most starkly represented in the agency\u201fs commitment to \ninternational best practices.   \n \nThis is not to argue for a retreat into a simple localism, but rather to insist on a \ndialogue which has as its object the ordinariness and contingencies of a particular \ndevelopment issue and place.  Moving towards a \u201elearning organisation\u201f (Ellerman, \n2002: 291) requires a recasting of international development agencies like the \nWorld Bank away from an adherence to set views and a \u201cpaternalistic model of \n 14 \n\u201eteaching\u201f\u201d, towards a \u201etwo-way\u201f learning process: \u201cIf the development agency can \nmove beyond the Church or party model to an open learning model, then it can \nalso move from standard knowledge dissemination or transmission-belt \nmethodology towards knowledge-based capacity building\u201d.  Ellerman echoes \nFreire (1970) in casting learning as a way of creating pedagogical and social \ntransformations, rather than an attempt to create linear knowledge additions.  This \nis rooted in a Socratic learning tradition of intellectual duelling in which \ndevelopment is an ongoing mutual engagement rather than preconceived and \npredetermined.  Such an engagement, however, must counter the unequal power \nrelations that contour Bank-client relations, and in doing so must move beyond a \nliberalist conception of \u201eintegrating subaltern knowledge\u201f towards a more radical \nconception.  The dissemination model of mainstream donors is, of course, an \nextreme case, but the example can be used to speak more broadly to the issue of \nlearning from subaltern constituencies.  \n \nAn important issue at stake here relates to the appropriation of subaltern \nknowledge.  Debates in postcolonial scholarship are useful here.  As Briggs and \nSharp (2004: 664) have written in relation to indigenous knowledge: \"A central \ntenet of postcolonial theory is its concern with the ontological and epistemological \nstatus of the voices of subaltern peoples in Western knowledge systems, and a \npostcolonial interrogation of the inclusion of indigenous knowledges in \ndevelopment suggests caution\".  Spivak (1988), writing about the desires of \nEuropean leftist intellectuals to \u201espeak for\u201f the Third World subaltern, has famously \nargued that the subaltern cannot speak, so imbued must s\/he be with the words, \nphrases and cadences of 'western thought' in order to be heard.  This is to say that \nthe subaltern cannot be heard as a consequence of the privileged position that, for \nexample, academic researchers or development consultants occupy.  This can \nlead to 'epistemic violence': ways of knowing the world outside of the language of \n\u201eWestern\u201f science, philosophy and development are invalidated or trivialised.  \nThus, \"the subaltern must always be caught in translation, never truly expressing \nherself, but always already interpreted\" (Briggs and Sharp, 2004: 664). \n \nSpivak's  (1993) notions of unlearning and learning outline a formulation of ethics \nin this regard.  \u201eUnlearning\u201f involves \u201cworking hard to gain knowledge of others \nwho occupy those spaces most closed to our privileged view and attempting to \nspeak to those others in a way that they might take us seriously and be able to \n 15 \nanswer back\u201d (McEwan, 2003: 384).  For Spivak, learning from one another is an \nethical imperative.  Learning in this sense is not about speaking for an individual or \ngroup, but developing new positions through interactions between researchers and \npeople in disparate locations.  This requires a \"greater sensitivity to the relationship \nbetween power, authority, positionality and knowledge\" (McEwan, 2003: 351).  \nThis ethic demands a consistent critical reflection in efforts that seek to learn \nbetween different contexts and constituencies.  A radical conception of learning \nentails a commitment to a different sort of epistemic violence - a rupture of the \nepisteme of the Euro-American academy.   Foucault may have argued that this \ncould only occur through an insurrection of subjugated knowledges (1980; 2003)i.   \n \nIn his 1976 Society Must be Defended lecture series, Foucault reflected upon the \nproliferation of social critique that had emerged in the previous 15 years.  These \nhad, in part, taken aim at 'global theories' such as Marxism and psychoanalysis.  \nHe names these critiques 'local critique'.  These multiple perspectives (criticizing \nthings, institutions, practices, discourses) are characterised by Foucault as the \n\u201cinsurrection of subjugated knowledges\u201d (2003: 7).  By subjugated knowledges he \nwas referring to two processes: first, the excavation of historical contents that have \nbeen buried in formal systematizations, and, second, the bringing forth of \n\u201enonconceptual knowledges\u201f - hierarchically inferior knowledges; naive \nknowledges, knowledges that are below the required level of erudition or \nscientificity (\u201cknowledges from below\u201d, 2003: 7).  Foucault contends that what is at \nstake in the excavation of these knowledges is \u201ca historical knowledge of \nstruggles\u201d, because in this agenda is the memory of combat: \u201cthe meticulous \nrediscovery of struggles and the raw memory of fights\u201d (2003: 8).  Such genealogy \nwould not be possible, Foucault contends, were it not for \u201cthe removal of the \ntyranny of overall discourses, with their hierarchies and all the privileges enjoyed \nby theoretical vanguards\u201d (ibid).  A central question, then, is what happens to \nsubjugated knowledges once they are brought into play?  They are not of \u201eequal\u201f \npower, so what effects do they have?  For McGee (1995: 205), tackling the \u201cvice of \nEurocentricism\u201d involves an epistemological transformation that privileges \nindigenous knowledge over an hegemonic \u201eWestern\u201f conception of reality.  \nPrivileging needs to be careful of romanticising local knowledge, while at the same \ntime sensitively addressing its subjugation.  I do not offer any straightforward \nsolutions to these difficulties here - these issues are context-specific and need \ncareful attention \u2013 but they are central methodological issues for a radical \nconception of learning.  In order to develop this conception of learning, in the next \n 16 \nsection I will engage with efforts to learn across a North-South divide, and will \nargue for a notion of indirect learning over a more restrictive notion of direct \nlearning.  \n \nLearning between development contexts \n \nIf a more radical approach to learning must confront positionality and power, \nlearning between contexts must address stereotypes that can limit those \nopportunities.  Stereotypes and superficial perceptions play an important role in \naffecting whether knowledge travels.  This is applicable, of course, beyond just the \nagencies of mainstream development.  To take an example from my own research, \nin one exchange between a nongovernmental organisation (NGO) working with \nhomelessness in the UK \u2013 Groundswell \u2013 and an NGO working with urban poverty \nin Mumbai, India \u2013 the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres \n(SPARC) \u2013 it was the perception of the UK group by the Indian group that \nconstituted one of the main reasons for limited engagement.   There was a belief \nby SPARC leaders that they had little to learn from Groundswell because of their \nperception that Groundswell was dependent on state welfare and focused on \nreceiving state financial assistance rather than developing their own solutions and \nfunding mechanisms.  In interview, one SPARC official invoked a broad distinction \nbetween First and Third Worlds.  She argued that there is little potential to learn \nbetween Indian and UK groups because of the \u201csocio-political culture\u201d in the UK.  \nShe pointed to what she viewed as a general \u201clack of community\u201d, adding that the \nBritish were too \u201cindividualistic\u201d, and extended this view to NGOs she had \nencountered in Japan.  She suggested that the UK and Japanese groups may find \neach other useful given these perceived commonalities.  Such comments imply a \npolarising of North (here including Japan) and South, where the former stands for \nindividualism and the latter a collectivist focus.  \n \nThis perception was inaccurate, and played an important role in militating against \nthe opportunities to learn between these two groups.  Any opportunities for SPARC \nto learn from the exchange were limited from the start.  The suggestion from \nSPARC was that Groundswell and the UK voluntary sector more generally was too \npassive because of a reliance on subsidy and therefore too different to be able to \noffer SPARC and its members any opportunities to learn.  On the other hand, \nGroundswell reported that they learned much from SPARC on the use of local \n\u201ehorizontal exchanges\u201f of poor people as a learning and \u201ecapacity-building\u201f tool, on \n 17 \nthe value of documenting the \u201ehidden homeless\u201f as a basis for state negotiation, \nand on the relationship between Groundswell as an NGO and the community-\nbased organisations it is linked with.  For the Groundswell members, there was an \nimportant role for solidarity based around the common experiences of social \ninjustice in forming relations between the UK homeless visitors and India\u201fs slum \nand pavement dwellers (see also Gaventa, 1999).  A Groundswell (2001a) diary \nreport written on an India-UK exchange in Mumbai argues that while conditions in \nIndia were radically different from those in the UK:  \n \nFor the UK group, the work of the [SPARC affiliates] NSDF and Mahila Milan had been \nextremely inspiring, and it was surprising and exciting that they shared many common \nexperiences.  Although the problems and challenges of homelessness and poverty might \nbe different, the process for involving homeless people in creating the solutions could be \nvery similar indeed.   \n \nOther people working with Groundswell who met with Indian visitors at an event in \nJanuary, 2000 in London commented on what they viewed as a potentially \nproductive learning relationship: \n \nWe have to join together as the people who are actually living the problem, not the people \ncoming in and telling us what the solution is.  If we do that in this country and actually form \na federation very similar to what they have in the South then we can actually federate with \nthem around the world and have a unified voice (Newton, in Groundswell 2001b).  \n \nSPARC\u201fs conception of learning, at least in this North-South instance, is closely \nrelated to its perception of Groundswell and its Northern context.  If SPARC had \nconceived learning with Groundswell as indirect, open and unpredictable, rather \nthan as restricted to the closed direct transfer of knowledge or experience (a view \nthat required for SPARC some measure of similarity in economic context), then a \nmore productive engagement may have been possible.  The conceptualisation of \nlearning as necessarily direct dismisses possibilities because of (real or perceived) \ndifferences, and is testament to the ongoing role of divisions of North and South as \nimaginative barriers, even in a context where the participants had opted to \nparticipate in the exchange (see Gaventa, 1999, for examples of more productive \nNorth-South NGO collaborations, and see Edwards and Gaventa, 2001).  \nExploring learning possibilities among civil society groups often involves \naddressing these sorts of myths and stereotypes.  Writing about the experiences of \n 18 \npeople from the US in visits to India and Mexico, Gaventa (1999: 35) points to the \n\u201camazement at the knowledge, commitment and sophistication\u201d participants found \n\u2013 \u201ca reality that did not fit with their received images of \u201ebackward\u201f people.\u201d  He \ncontinues: \n \nMoreover, they often gained inspiration from the commitment which they saw\u2026\u201cBy getting \nrid of our myths, we create the desire to learn more.  Understanding that we have been \ntaught wrong and then looking at the problems and consequences of that misteaching \ncreates enormous openings.  It\u201fs like turning a rock into a piece of clay that wants to be \nmalleable by choice\u201d (quoted in Covey et al, 1995: 11, in Gaventa, 1999: 35). \n \nHere, I argue for a conceptualisation of learning alert to the possibility that it can \noccur not just in spite of differences, but through them.  This notion of learning can \npresent new opportunities and prompt innovative thinking, and points to the \npossibilities created by conceiving learning as indirect rather than direct.  In order \nto develop the notion of indirect learning, I will consider an example from \ndevelopment studies. \n \nOne instructive and provocative attempt to explore the possibilities of learning \nabout development between North and South is a special issue of an Institute of \nDevelopment Studies (IDS) Bulletin of 1998 entitled Poverty and Social Exclusion \nin North and South, edited by De Haan and Maxwell.  De Haan and Maxwell \ncontend that it would be \u201cfoolish to deny the possibility of learning across \ngeographical boundaries\u201d (1998: 5), and make a series of interventions on different \nthemes of development.  The theme issue highlights a number of specific areas \nwhere connections can be made, including the nature of \u201eactive labour market \npolicies\u201f designed to help people find work (P. Robinson, 1998), the nature of \nparticipation in development programmes (Gaventa, 1998), alternative routes to \nthe reform of social welfare (Evans, 1998), and the value of food security analysis \n(Dowler, 1998).  De Haan and Maxwell make some further suggestions: \u201cWhat, for \nexample, can we learn in the North from the successes with employment \nguarantee schemes in India or Botswana?\u201d (1998: 7).  They make suggestions for \njoint research projects on specific themes: \u201c[S]mall-scale credit, participation and \nparticipatory methods, social policy, food policy, and public works; and, indeed, in \nthe meaning and measurement of poverty and social exclusion\u201d (de Haan and \nMaxwell, 1998: 8).   \n \n 19 \nIn their editorial, De Haan and Maxwell (1998: 7) argue that even if knowledge \ncannot travel directly, attempts to learn between North and South can still be \n\u201cfruitful\u201d.  In his contribution, Maxwell (1998: 24) argues that \u201cthe point here is not \nto pretend that analysis and policy from one country can be read off directly from \nanother, even within broad groupings of North and South.  It is simply to \ndemonstrate that opportunities are missed to compare and contrast\u201d.  However, \nelsewhere in the issue De Haan and Maxwell (1998: 7) insert a caveat: \u201cDespite \ngrowing heterogeneity among developing countries and some signs of \nconvergence between the North and parts of the South\u2026the particularities of place \nand history remain important, so that lessons can rarely be transferred directly\u201d.  \nThis is an important point, but perhaps a more useful way to conceptualise this is \nto emphasise that because the particularities of place and history are important, \nlearning can occur but usually indirectly.  This requires the understanding that \nknowledge and ideas can change in new circumstances, and that learning can \noccur in creative, indirect ways.  For instance, specific development strategies in \nthe South, like public works, food policy or participation, may appear to offer little \nopportunity for learning in the North if the approach is to ask whether the strategies \ncan be transferred directly.  They may offer more, however, if the approach is to \nengage in debate around these strategies without a rigid predetermined notion of \nhow they may be useful.  More general debates about the nature of development, \nsuch as those concerned with the meaning and measurement of terms like \n\u201epoverty\u201f and \u201edevelopment\u201f, or about the possibilities of employing a livelihoods \napproach to development in the North, also offer a basis through which indirect \nlearning may occur.  How, then, might this indirect learning actually take place?  In \nwhat senses might we think of this kind of learning?  And how might this combine \nwith the radical conception of ethical learning outlined above?  The next section \nexplores these questions by drawing on scholarship in both development studies \nand postcolonialism. \n \nBorder crossings: methods and strategies \n \nMaxwell (1998: 21-28) has suggested that we examine potential new relationships \nbetween different contexts in terms of \u201ecomparisons\u201f, \u201econvergences\u201f and \n\u201econnections\u201f.  By comparisons, Maxwell is referring to similarities and differences \nin approaches to poverty and social exclusion.  For example, he asks: \u201cAre there \nnot lessons for the developed countries in the developing country emphasis on \nsecure and sustainable livelihoods, rather than jobs?\u201d (1998: 23).  In another \n 20 \ninstance, he points out that \u201cpolicy initiatives in the North about how to remedy \nfood poverty seem sterile by comparison with those in the South: overly \npreoccupied with small-scale, local initiatives, nutrition education and the like, too \nlittle concerned with macro-economic issues, national food-pricing, and the \ngeographical distribution of shops\u201d (Maxwell, 1998: 24).  Maxwell asserts that \ntheorising comparisons must avoid homogenising and meta-theories, instead \nemphasising the multiple trajectories of those living in different spaces: \n \nThe poverty experienced by a small-scale pastoralist in semi-arid Tanzania is not of the \nsame character, and does not have the same causes, as that experienced by a landless \nfamily in a cash-cropping area of the same country, let alone that experienced by people \ncarrying similar labels in other countries, or by those carrying different labels altogether.  \nMultiple realities need multiple theories \u2013 across the North \u2013 South boundary (Maxwell, \n1998: 26). \n \nIn the formulation of comparison there is an at least implicit possibility of \ntransformation in the ways in which development is read and debated.  There are \nechoes here of Said\u201fs (1993) notion of \u201econtrapuntality\u201f, a concept developed to \nanalyse the \u201eWestern\u201f cultural archive with an awareness both to the dominated \nhistory narrated and the \u201eother histories\u201f against which it acts.  Contrapuntality, for \nMufti (2005: 478), \u201cbegins to encode a comparativism yet to come, a global \ncomparativism that is a determinate and concrete response to the hierarchical \nsystems that have dominated cultural life since the colonial era\u201d.  This is not to \nsimply suggest that hierarchies of North-South, First World-Third World, can be \nabandoned, as if it was in the power of academia or development practitioners to \ndo so.  Rather, in the rethinking of what those notions stand for, indirect learning \ncan occur by drawing comparisons across disparate, and seemingly unlikely, \nplaces. \n \nBy convergences, Maxwell (1998) is referring to how different areas across the \nglobe are converging in various ways, for instance, in share of manufactures of \nGDP, general shifts towards income tax, or growing and differentiating literacy \nrates.  By connections, he is referring to the myriad economic, social, political and \ncultural connections often associated with globalisation, including the linking of \nNGOs and the common causes of poverty.  He sees opportunities to develop \ntheories and perspectives that mirror transnational trends in that they move \nbeyond divides of North and South (Maxwell, 1998: 26).  The Ford Foundation\u201fs \n 21 \nCrossing Borders initiatives mentioned earlier focuses on this theme of connection.  \nThe University of Berkeley\u201fs Area Studies and the New Geographies activities are \none set of examples here. Many of these initiatives, straddling a broadly defined \ninternational studies and geopolitics literature, seek to re-theorise established \nnotions of \u201earea\u201f, \u201eregion\u201f and \u201eborder\u201f.  They have focused on the emergence of a \nplethora of political, economic and cultural connections and disconnections in \ndifferent pats of the globe, and used them to illuminate understanding not just of \nregions like Africa or East Asia, but to look anew at notions like globalisation and \nmodernity, as well as to interrogate the utility of different theoretical perspectives \nas they operate in different spaces.  Much of this work has sought to theorise the \nrelationship between area and globalisation, interrogating those terms in the \nprocess.  Theoretically, the central reference point has remained \u201eWestern\u201f \ntheorists, including Bourdieu, Castells, Foucault, Geertz, Giddens, and Habermas \n(Institute of International Studies, 2006).  The emphasis here has been on \ntheorising the changing geographies of localities and regions produced by new \nforms of connection, rather than on questions of learning. \n   \nMaxwell\u201fs (1998) useful schema of comparisons, convergences, and connections \noffers a set of ways to conceptually connect different parts of the globe in a \nprogressive way.  It is progressive because while it focuses attention on the \npossibilities of learning between different contexts, it does not do so at the \nexpense of the particularities of place and circumstance.  Writing in a similar vein, \nRobinson (2002: 532) promotes \u201ca more cosmopolitan approach\u201d to urban \nstudies\u201d.  This is an approach that seeks to bring more cities into view in urban \nstudies, and that does so through a postcolonial critique of generalised, abstract \nEuro-American analytic categories. For Robinson, this is not simply about invoking \ndeviation from a dominant Euro-American theme.  Two strategies in particular are \nrequired.  First, a need to decolonise Euro-American perspectives by consistently \nasking, \u201cHow are theoretical approaches changed by considering different cities \nand different contexts?\u201d (Robinson, 2002: 549).  Ferguson (2006) has pointed out \nthat in the enormous scholarly and public literatures on globalisation, positive and \nnegative, remarkably little has been said about Africa.  As he shows, an \nengagement with scholarship on the political economy of Africa reveals key \nfeatures of how the \u201eglobal\u201f works and how it might work in the future.  What he \nsees, for example through often heavily guarded transnational enclaves of mineral \nextraction, is a global of \u201csharp, jagged edges; rich and dangerous traffic amid \nzones of generalized abjection; razor-wired enclaves next to abandoned \n 22 \nhinterlands\u201d (Ferguson, 2006: 48).  He does not suggest that this view from Africa \nreveals the \u201etrue nature\u201f of globalization, but that it highlights \u201canother perspective \non the \u201eglobal\u201f\u201d and insists \u201cthat there is no view of \u201eglobalization\u201f that \u201ecovers it all\u201f\u201d \n(ibid. 49).  This is not an attempt to \u201eadd Africa and stir\u201f, as if arriving at an all-\ninclusive picture, but to demonstrate that \u201cthe view from Africa challenges us to \ndevelop new, more situated understandings of emerging global patterns\u201d (ibid). \n \nSecond, there is a need to engage, on as close a level playing field as possible, \nwith the work of thinkers in different places: \u201cIf a cosmopolitan urban theory is to \nemerge, scholars in privileged western environments will need to find responsible \nand ethical ways to engage with, learn from and promote the ideas of intellectuals \nin less privileged places\u201d (Robinson, 2002: 549-550).  This requires a critical \nepistemic interrogation and reworking, such as that found in Appadurai\u201fs \nformulation of \u201estrong internationalisation\u201f: \n \n[\u201eStrong internationalization\u201f] is to imagine and invite a conversation about research in \nwhich\u2026the very elements of this ethic could be the subjects of debate.  Scholars from \nother societies and traditions of inquiry could bring to this debate their own ideas about \nwhat counts as new knowledge and what communities of judgement and accountability \nthey might judge to be central in the pursuit of such knowledge (Appadurai, 2000: 14). \n \nThe notion of strong internationalization is one that embodies a progressive \noutlook to the possibilities of learning between different spaces and constituencies, \nand requires an openness to distinct forms of knowledge production that do not \nnecessarily comply with, for instance, Euro-American traditions of academic \nknowledge production.  This would involve a particular and reflexive engagement \nwith, for example, indigenous conceptions of environment and conservation, \nactivist-intellectual forms of knowledge about the lives of people living in slums, or \nregimes of academic knowledge production formulated through distinct patterns of \ncollection, citation or judgement.  There is a challenge here for academics to \nconnect more closely and more frequently with the worlds and vocabularies of \ndisparate scholars and activists: \u201cOne of the biggest disadvantages faced by \nactivists working for the poor in fora such as the World Bank, the UN system, the \nWTO, NAFTA, and GATT is their alienation from the vocabulary used by the \nuniversity-policy nexus (and, in a different way, by corporate ideologues and \nstrategists) to describe global problems, projects and policies.  A strong effort to \n 23 \ncompare, describe and theorize 'globalization-from-below' could help to close this \ngap\u201d (Appadurai, 2000: 17).   \n \nThis involves interrogation of terms like development, globalisation, politics and \nmodernity, and an examination of what their heterogeneity might mean.  Inevitably, \nthis must be a geographical discussion.  For example, social scientists may write \nof politics as a shared homogenous and abstract zone, wherein the vote, for \ninstance, is a central \u201canonymous performance of citizenship\u201d (Chatterjee, 2004: \n18).  But, as Chatterjee (2004: 11) has written in reference to early Independent \nIndia, political actions, programs and authority are often transmitted in the \nlanguage of myth or popular religion.  In this context, the vote may be less an act \nof support for a candidate with aspirations for parliamentary presence, and more \nan act of faithful affirmation towards particular individuals, such as Mahatma \nGandhi (who was often constructed through stories of miraculous powers, see \nAmin, 1984).  Similarly, the examination of \u201ealternative modernities\u201f is generally \ndifferent in Asia and in Africa.  If the discussion in East Asia, for example, centers \non attempts to ensure that \u201eeconomic convergence\u201f with the \u201eWest\u201f takes place \nwith \u201eAsian values\u201f, then the discussion in many parts of Africa begins be \nemphasising the modernity of traditions, as in Geschiere\u201fs (1997) \u201emodernity of \nwitchcraft\u201f, for instance (see Ferguson, 2006: 184-185).  Ferguson (2006: 184) \nargues that among scholars of Africa, talk of economic convergence has been \nlargely abandoned as implausible.  There is a need to go beyond, as these \nscholars and others have done, simply emphasizing the heterogeneity of \nconceptions and practices of politics, modernity, or globalisation, towards an effort \nto develop more situated understandings.   \n \nThese two imperatives, to provincialise and to create new forms of dialogue, offer \nthe possibility \u2013 as Robinson (2003a: 275) has written \u2013 of an \u201cengaging and \ncritical transnational, but also post-universal, scholarship suitable for the diverse, \nor \u201ediscrepant\u201f, cosmopolitanisms (Clifford, 1997) of most societies\u201d.  If such an \napproach invites the possibility of a reimagining of international scholarly practices, \none task for development studies is to build-on schema\u201fs like Maxwell\u201fs (1998) by \ndeveloping concepts and methods that invoke learning from different places in \nprogressive ways. \n \nFor instance, to Maxwell\u201fs (1998) schema we might add the notion of translation in \norder to highlight the necessity and creative possibility of adaptation in learning.  \n 24 \nWhile Maxwell\u201fs notion of comparisons points to this, the notion of translation is \nmore explicit and places greater emphasis on the potential value of indirect \nlearning, thus drawing emphasis away from a focus on simply whether knowledge \nor an idea can be transferred directly or not.  Translation comes originally from the \nwork of Michel Serres (1974) and \u201cinvolves creating convergences and homologies \nby relating things that were previously different\u201d (Gherardi and Nicolini, 2000: 333).  \nLatour (1999: 179) uses translation to refer not to \u201ca shift from one vocabulary to \nanother, from one French word to one English word, for instance\u201d, but \u201cto mean \ndisplacement, drift, invention, mediation, the creation of a link that did not exist \nbefore and that to some degree modifies the original two\u201d.  A \u201cchain of translation\u201d \nrefers to the many steps through which knowledge is produced (Latour, 1999: \n311).  The process of translation changes to varying extents not just the forms of \nknowledge but the people and places that come into relation with knowledge.  \nRather than focussing simply on the question of whether knowledge remains the \nsame or not, it focuses attention on the multiple forms and effects of knowledge.   \n \nTranslation challenges the diffusion model (of epidemiological origin) that traces \nmovement as innovationii (Brown, 2002; Hagerstrand, 1968; Latour, 1986).  While \nthe diffusion model focuses on travel as the product of the action of an \nauthoritative centre transmitting knowledge, translation focuses on travel as the \nproduct of what different actors do with objects (statements, orders, artefacts, \nproducts, goods, etc.) (Gherardi and Nicolini, 2000: 335).  This draws attention to \nthe creative interaction between the \u201ehere\u201f and \u201ethere\u201f, and the particular and the \ngeneral.  Translation is open to the possibility of varying degrees of stability and \nflux: it is not the case that every encounter must always involve complete change, \nnor is it the case that every encounter must always involve the recreation of a \nperiphery in the image of a centre.  Translation, then, embodies a sense of \ncreative possibility that does not reduce learning to direct transfer (I have \ndeveloped this argument elsewhere by examining the role of translation in \u201epost-\nrationalist\u201f approaches to learning, McFarlane, 2006a).  In this context, we might \nusefully invoke Said\u201fs (1984) development of \u201etravelling theory\u201fiii.  Said argued \nagainst the tendency to seek to apply theories wholesale or to dismiss them as \ncompletely irrelevant.  He argued that the use of theory need not be reduced to \nthis binary construction, and he regretted that much intellectual work is caught up \nin what he viewed at the time as an anxiety and \/ or criticism over the question of \nmisinterpretation: \n \n 25 \nIt implies, first of all, that the only possible alternative to slavish copying is creative \nmisreading and that no intermediate possibility exists.  Second, when it is elevated to a \ngeneral principle\u2026[it] is fundamentally an abrogation of the critic\u201fs responsibility\u2026Quite the \ncontrary, it seems to me possible to judge misreadings  (as they occur) as part of a \nhistorical transfer of ideas and theories from one setting to another (Said, 1984: 237). \n \nThis notion of \u201emisreading\u201f focuses attention on the importance of change and the \npositive role of using what is witnessed, experienced or read about in one place in \na way that need not be about trying to copy and directly apply it in another.  The \nconcept addresses a politics of replication by emphasising the importance of \ncreativity and local relevance.  An emphasis on indirect learning rallies against the \ndismissal of, for instance, a place, knowledge or an idea as wholly irrelevant, and \ndraws attention to the creative and uncertain possibilities of misreadings.  \nConcepts like translation or perspectives like travelling theory open possibilities for \nindirect learning and assert transformation over transfer.      \n \nThis argument for a new conception of learning about development between \ndifferent contexts does not extend to arguing for a wholesale organisational \nchange, so that the remit of, say, scholars working in development studies, goes \nfrom local to global.  Instead, the conceptual changes that I am arguing for involve \na willingness to engage in examples of development transnationally in order to \nmove towards a richer, more postcolonial development.  This might involve, for \nexample, development scholars focussed on Euro-American cities engaging with \nliterature and colleagues working on and in different urban contexts, and in ways \nthat go beyond simply \u201eadding-on\u201f a case study towards developing \nunderstandings that are both more informed and more situated.  In reference to \ndevelopment studies, Maxwell (1998: 28) suggests ways of negotiating this \nchallenge: \n \nThere is one route I think we should not take, which is that each of us should try to merge \nall our work into one, covering North and South\u2026Instead, people who specialise on the \nNorth or South will continue to do so, but should make new efforts to learn from each other, \nto explore common problems brought on by convergence, and perhaps to develop new \ntheory together.  The best place to start might be with specific topics, like public works, \nfood policy or participation \u2013 indeed, with the meaning and measurement of terms like \n\u201epoverty\u201f and \u201esocial exclusion\u201f.  This will enable collaboration to be built inductively, from \nthe bottom-up. \n \n 26 \nFor Slater (1997; and see 2004), an openness to different conceptions, practices \nand modes of knowledge production requires an ethic of respect and critical \nreflection, offering one set of possibilities for beginning to negotiate the unequal \npower relations of such engagements.  This approach echoes Spivak\u201fs (1998) \nethical conception of learning, and the radical conception discussed earlier:  \n \nIn a world increasingly configured by global connectivity, a strong case can be made for \nposing the significance of another three Rs - respect, recognition and reciprocity.  If our \ngeopolitical imagination in the field of knowledge is going to be open, nomadic, \ncombinatory, critical and inquiring, it can displace the hold of Euro-Americanist thought and \nfind ways of learning from the theoretical reflexivity of different writers and academics from \nother worlds and cultures\u2026Mutual respect and recognition must include, if they are to be of \nany meaningful ethical value, the right to be critical and different on both sides of any \ncultural or intellectual border.  Reciprocity and dialogue can only emerge if there is a will to \ngo beyond indifference and historically sedimented pre-judgements; to engage in analytical \nconversations with others in ways that can make the outside part of the inside and vice-\nversa has the potential to engender mutually beneficial encounters (Slater, 1997: 648). \n \nThis image of a respectful form of strong internationalization also entails working \nfor new collectives of \u201eelite\u201f and \u201esubaltern\u201f, which are reflexive of who starts and \ncontrols them as well as who the members are.  It is an image that opens another \nset of challenges at the center of the power-relations of academic knowledge \nproduction: learning how to learn from below (see Brohman, 1996; Edwards, \n1989).  For Spivak (2003: 52), this involves far more than just \u201elearning about other \ncultures\u201f, \u201cthis is imagining yourself, really letting yourself be imagined (experience \nthat impossibility) without guarantees, by and in another culture\u201d.  Such an effort \nwould in part echo Spivak's  (1993) ethical formulation of unlearning and learning, \nwhere learning in new collectives is an ethical imperative that outlines a horizon of \ntransformation: towards a postcolonial project as an 'ethic-politics' of becoming, \nemphasising the processual and anticipatory \u2013 in McEwan\u201fs (2003: 349) words, \n\"recognising a condition that does not yet exist, but working nevertheless to bring \nthat about\".  Developing these sorts of collectives in research around, for instance, \ndevelopment, can contribute to new ways of imagining the research enterprise, as \nwell as places and regions.  This involves asking not just how \u201eothers\u201f see \ndevelopment, but how they see the world (in regional terms and in other ways) - in \nshort, \"how does the world look...from other locations (social, cultural, national)?\u201d \n(Appadurai, 2000: 8; see Ferguson, 2006).  Often, the view from different locations \nis at odds with more established positions, whether this is in terms of the questions \n 27 \nthat seem most relevant, the issues that matter most, the objectives of scholarship \nor knowledge, or other criteria.  North-South learning is not a straightforward \nprocess; it must negotiate these differences with sensitivity to the world-views of \nthose \u201eon the ground\u201f.  Engaging these \u201eglobal shadows\u201f (Ferguson, 2006) marks \nthe lineaments of a postcolonial development that transcends North and South: the \nformation of new collectives across space, of researchers and activists, with the \naim of understanding and theorising different and changing forms of development.   \n   \nConclusion \n \nIf we are approaching an interdisciplinary moment in the social sciences and \nhumanities (Bal, 2002; Thrift, 2002), this has not translated into a strongly \ninternational moment.  For all the talk of globalisation or subaltern knowledge, and \ndespite influential interventions in development (Chambers, 2002) and postcolonial \n(Spivak, 1988) studies, there has been little attempt to consider how learning \nbetween North and South contexts and constituencies might be conceived.  In \nSpivak\u201fs (2003: 72) Death of a Discipline, she argues that Comparative Literature, \nthrough a dialogue with Area Studies, should urgently attempt to re-imagine itself \nas \u201cplanetary rather than continental, global, or worldly\u201d.  For Spivak, discourses of \nglobalisation too often present the world as graspable, as a space that can be \nmapped, controlled, and centralised.  In proposing \u201eplanet\u201f, she proposes a figure \nimpossible to derive or hold, entailing a particular conception of ourselves as \nplanetary subjects rather than global agents.  \u201ePlanterity\u201f is mobilised as a way of \nthinking beyond a cartographic reading of space, an open concept that insists on \nan attempt to think before and beyond the striated spaces of areas, regions, and \ncontinents.  It is, then, the impossible possible, an undecideable alterity in that it \ncannot be predicted, only prefigured, imagined: \u201cWhen I invoke the planet, I think \nof the effort required to figure the (im)possibility of this underived intuition\u201d (Spivak, \n2003: 72).  It is not the academic\u201fs task, argues Spivak, to develop these \nplanetarities.  The possibility of planetarity lies in the academic working with \nsubaltern constituencies and literatures, making the key methodological challenge \nlearning how to learn.  This methodology can lead to new and different \ntheorisations of disparate phenomena, not all of which, of course, will be \nnecessarily progressive.  Spivak calls for new collectives crossing old academic \nborders, collectives that can imagine alterity to History and Space, and which are \ninterrogative of their own limitations (she insists, for instance, that we consistently \nask ourselves, \u201ehow many are we?\u201f).  Planetarity, then, involves an attempt to \n 28 \nmove beyond the boundaries of familiar cartographic spacings, such as North or \nSouth.  \n \nSpivak is centrally concerned in this book with Comparative Literature and Area \nStudies, but in closing I would seek to retain her enthusiasm for dialogue between \nthe humanities and social sciences around the problematic of \u201eglobal learning\u201f.  In \nparticular, I would emphasise the importance of the growing dialogue between \npostcolonial and development scholarship as a basis for developing new ways of \nconducting research on development.  In developing new concepts and methods \nfor internationalising the interdisciplinary formation of development in different \ncontexts, opportunities for learning between and from different places in \nprogressive ways can emerge.  However, it is crucial that there is critical reflection \non how learning is conceived.   \n \nI have argued for a conception of learning that is critically reflexive of unequal \npositions and power relations and that seeks new modes of learning outside of \ndominant institutionalised practices of knowledge production.  This is a conception \nof learning that focuses not just on the direct transfer of knowledge, but on the \ncreative possibility of indirect learning.  It is a view of learning that is at once ethical \nand indirect.  It is ethical because it transcends a liberal integration of subaltern \nknowledge, and supports new forms of epistemic violence through which \nsubjugated knowledges might reposition development debates and practices.  It is \nindirect because it transcends a rationalist tendency to limit learning to direct \nknowledge transfer between places perceived as \u201esimilar\u201f.  This conception and \npolitics of learning, then, would hope to generate new forms of dialogue and border \ncrossings in contemporary development debates.  I have highlighted a number of \ntools aimed at this purpose, from Maxwell\u201fs schema of comparison-connection-\nconvergence, to concepts like translation and perspectives like travelling theory or \nstrong internationalisation.  These concepts and methods act against the \nimperative to categorise in ways that limit opportunities to learn from different \ncontexts, whether they are imaginaries of First-Third World or North-South.  \nRather, they contribute to the broader project of a more postcolonial development \nand social science, and offer the opportunity of an undecided and yet-to-be-written \nplanetary development studies. \n \n 29 \n \nReferences \n \nS Amin, Unequal Development: An Essay on the Social Formation of \nPeripheral Capitalism, New York: Monthly Review Press, 1976. \n \nS Amin, \u201eGandhi as Mahatma\u201f, in R Guha (ed) Subaltern Studies III, Delhi: Oxford \nUniversity Press, 1984, pp 1-61. \n \nA Appadurai, \u201eGrassroots Globalization and the Research Imagination\u201f, in Public \nCulture, 12(1), 2000, pp 1-9. \n \nM Bal, Travelling Concepts in the Humanities: A Rough Guide.
