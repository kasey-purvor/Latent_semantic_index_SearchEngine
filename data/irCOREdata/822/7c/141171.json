INTRODUCTION \nIt is now an obligation to improve reliability, \navailability, and safety of railway systems to \naccommodate increasing passenger and cargo \ntransportation with higher train speeds, greater axle loads, \nand increased service frequency. According to a report of \nthe European Commission, the passenger and cargo \ntransportation volume in European railways are expected \nto double and triple respectively in 2020 [1]-[5]. It is \nobvious that this demand increase cannot be satisfied with \nonly building new railways; the efficiency of existing and \nnew railways should be increased. This could be achieved \nwith minimum cost by increasing the availability of \nrailways, which is directly related with repair and \nmaintenance frequency.  \nBritain\u2019s railway infrastructure operator, Network Rail, \nwas responsible for approximately 14 million minutes of \ntrain delay in 2002-2003, costing approximately 560 \nmillion GBP [5]. Railway turnout systems are the main \ncomponent of railway infrastructure that affects the \navailability of the system [6]. For example in England, 3.4 \nmillion GBP is spent every year for the maintenance of \nturnout systems for 1000 km of railways [6]. Condition-\nBased Maintenance (CBM), in which the health of the \nmachine is observed in real time and maintenance \ndecisions are based on the current and forecasted machine \nhealth, increases system availability, reliability and safety \nwhile reducing operating and support costs [7]-[8]. Thus, \nthe application of CBM on railway turnout systems has \ncritical importance for increasing the efficiency of \nrailways.  \nDiagnostics and prognostics are the two main \ncomponents of CBM [7]. Diagnostics, the process of \nidentifying the failure, is basically a classification \nproblem; prognostics, the prediction of the failure time of \nthe component with an incipient failure, is a forecasting \nproblem. Various diagnostic methods have been presented \nin the literature for many diverse industrial systems [9] -\n[14]. Diagnostic methods on various components of the \nrailway and train have also been reported [15]-[20].  \nThere are three main approaches in the literature for \ndiagnostics on turnout systems: feature-, model- and \nempirically-based methods. In the first approach, special \nfeatures that help to identify the failures are defined. For \nexample in [21], three features (i.e., irregularity, location \nof maximum point, and symmetry) are defined in the time \nseries data. These features are obtained by analyzing the \nabsolute difference between the reference and actual \nsignals. The reference signal is collected from a fault-free \nsystem. The absolute difference is in the form of a time \nseries-like reference. Irregularity is defined as an \nunexpected bump in the absolute difference.

The symmetry of the \nabsolute difference of the left and right sides of the \nmaximum point location is used as the third feature.  \nIn model-based approaches, a model is defined to \ncharacterize the system. Deviation from the model is \ndefined as failure and identified as the difference between \nthe model outcome and actual data. Various methods may \nbe applied. In [22], the unobserved component model, in \nwhich an observable variable is written as a function of \nseveral unobservable components, is used. In [23], \nparameters like velocity and air volume are expressed as \npolynomial functions of pressure in a pneumatic turnout \nsystem. Thus, the difference between the actual velocity \nand\/or air volume and their expected values for a given \npressure identifies the failure.  \nIn empirically-based approaches, a fault-free sample is \nconsidered as a reference signal, and failures are \nidentified based on the resemblance of a given signal to \nthe reference signal. The Kalman filter is used in [24] for \nnoise removal and failure identification based on a \nreference signal. Ref. [25] presents an expert system for \nfailure identification using resemblance to the reference \nsignal. The resemblance is quantified using simple \nEuclidian distance and dynamic time warping approaches. \nA good review for failure detection methods for railway \nturnouts is given in [26]. \nFailure diagnosis is an important task; however, it only \naims to stop (and schedule a maintenance\/repair) the \nsystem when a failure is identified or let the system \ncontinue to work otherwise. Incipient failures progress \nslowly [27]. This progression starts from the fault free \nstate and ends at the failure state [28]. The system \nfunctions properly and does whatever is expected (albeit \nmaybe with decreasing efficiency) until reaching the \nfailure state. It is obvious that the detection of failure \nprogression is more valuable than its detection after the \nfailure reaches to a point. In addition, it is a prerequisite \nfor prognostics [28], [29].  \nStudies of prognostics for different systems have \nappeared in the literature in recent years. Prognostic \nmethods can be separated into three categories: \nevolutionary, degradation prediction, and state-based \nprognostics [8]. Evolutionary prognostics involves \ntrending features until a predefined threshold, whereas the \ndegradation calculated with features is predicted with \nstatistical and computational methods in the degradation \nprediction based prognostics [8]. In the last category, the \nstates representing the failure progression are detected and \nforecasted. \nHidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used as \nstate-based prognostics in [28], [30]-[34] with different \napplication areas such as drilling processes, pump \nsystems, and AC motors. The life of a drill-bit is \nrepresented by health states, each of which is modeled as \na single HMM in [31]-[32]. Health state of a drill-bit is \nidentified with the HMM with highest likelihood value \ngiven the observed time series signal. In standard HMM, \ntransition from one state to another is independent of time \nspent in the current state. This assumption is not true in \nfailure degradation applications and it is relaxed in [30] \nwith semi-Markov concept.  \nIn [28], health states are represented as the top state of \nHierarchical HMM, rather than a distinct HMM as in [28], \n[31], [32]. Monte-Carlo simulation with health state \ntransition probabilities is used in [28] to calculate the \nremaining useful life (RUL). In [33], frequency and \nseverity of noncatastrophic faults are used to detect RUL \nof an electric drive. Four methods have been used for fault \ndetection and HMM based framework is presented for \nprognostics. Second order HMM, in which states depend \non the two previous states, is used for prediction of health \nstates in [34]. In [35], concentration of lubrication \nsamples is used to identify the abnormality in diesel \nengines. Then, a belief network created with expert \nknowledge is used for prognostics. \nThis paper presents a simple state-based prognostic \n(SSBP) method that aims to detect and forecast failure \nprogression in electro-mechanical systems. The method is \ncompared with HMM-based methods using real data \ncollected from a railway turnout system. Failures in \nelectro-mechanical systems mostly occur slowly, and it \nmay take months\/years for a failure to occur. Thus, \nobtaining statistically sufficient samples from the fault-\nfree state to the failure state may require a very long time. \nIn addition, the validation of classification methods \nrequires knowing the real failure progression states. \nHowever, observing the real failure progression states is \nvery difficult, if not impossible, in most systems [28]. \nThis paper also presents a solution to these problems. The \nmain contributions of this paper can be summarized as \nfollows: \n1. Presenting a simple state-based prognostic method and \nits comparison with HMM-based prognostics;  \n2. Application of presented (SSBP) and HHM-based \nprognostics methods in a railway turnout system; \n3. Presenting a data collection strategy for slowly \ndeveloping failures to model the real failure progression; \n4. Proposing a strategy to validate the state estimation \nmethod without knowing the real failure progression \nstates.  \nThe organization of the paper is as follows: section II \ngives the details of a turnout system, section III presents \nthe modeling structure, section IV gives experiments and \nresults with real data collected from a turnout system, and \nsection V concludes the paper.  \n \n \nFig. 1. Railway tracks to be moved by a turnout system \n II. RAILWAY TURNOUT SYSTEM\nRailway turnout systems allow trains to change their \ntracks by moving the rails before the train passes\nin Fig 1. The turnout system, which is a form of single \nthrow mechanical equipment, is run by a motor as shown \nin Fig 2.  There exist different types of railway turnouts \nbased on motor working principle, such as electro\nmechanic, hydraulic, and pneumatic. The m\nthe blades\/switches in two directions, called normal and \nreverse. This movement takes several seconds. Once the \nmovement is completed, the switches are locked in their \nposition. It is claimed that the turnout systems are the \nof the most important component of the railway \ninfrastructure, and there exist examples of accidents \ncaused by turnout failure [6]. This paper focuses on \nelectro-mechanic turnout systems, which consist of \nmotor, reduction gear, several bearings, drive\nrods, switches etc.  \n \nFig. 2.  A railway turnout system \nIII. MODELING STRUCTURE \nThis section includes two sub-section\nprogression modeling and a simple state-based prognostic \nmethod.  \nA. Failure Progression Modeling  \nElectro-mechanical failures mostly occur slowly\nfollowing a degradation path [36]. It is easy to understand \nthe difficulty of obtaining statistically sufficient\nprogression samples, considering that a failure may \nprogress for several months to years in real systems\nThere are two ways to overcome this problem: 1) using \nprototypes for data collection or 2) creating the failure \nprogression unnaturally.  \nThe prototypes are created with vulnerable materials\nand operating conditions are set so that the failure \nprogresses faster than normal [28], [31]-[32\nthin drill-bits or preventing the proper functioning of \ncooling systems are some examples used in the literature \n[28]. Although this approach may be applicable for simple \ncomponents like a drill-bit, it is difficult to obtain an \nacceptable prototype to represent something complex like \n \n, as seen \n-\notor moves \none \na \n-detection \n \ns: failure \n, \n failure \n. \n, \n].

In such a complex system, the failure \nprogression should be created unnaturally. \nThe exponential degradation model \nprior information about degradation \nused in this paper and formulated \ndegradation paths for samples as shown in Fig. \nobtained using this formula.

Simple State-Based Prognostics Method\nThe presented method (SSBP) includes three steps\nillustrated in Fig. 4: clustering, cluster \nexpected RUL calculation.

Several cluster validity indexes have been \nproposed in the literature [37],[38]. Silhouette, Davies-\nBouldin, Calinski-Harabasz, Dunn, C-index, Krzanowski-\nLai, and several other indexes are implemented, and \nCalinski-Harabasz (CH) is chosen as the most robust one \nfor the dataset used in this paper.

In a failure \nprogression problem, it is very difficult, if not impossible, \nto observe the health states the system goes through and to \nknow their total number. Thus, clustering and validity \nindexes are used to identify the number of health states.  \nAfter the current health state of a given system is \nidentified using clustering, the remaining useful life is \nforecasted as illustrated in Fig. 5. The expected RUL is \ncalculated using the transition probabilities between \nhealth states as shown (3). The transition probability is the \nprobability of the current health state to change. The \nresults of the k-means clustering are used to identify these \nprobabilities. k number of clusters and the number of \ntransitions from one cluster to another are found with all \ntraining samples. For example, assume three turnout \nsystems with health states numbered sequentially from 1 \nto 4 (from the brand new to the failure state) as shown in \nTable 1. Each row shows the progression in health states \nfor a turnout system. The three turnout systems fail after \n13, 10, and 9 time units. A total of twelve transitions from \nstate 1 (transition to state 2 after 4, 6, and 2 time steps, \nstate 1 otherwise) have happened in three turnouts. \nBecause three state transitions out of twelve from state 1 \nhave happened to state 2, the transition probability from \nstate 1 to state 2 is initialized as 3\/12. Similarly, the state \ntransition probability from state 1 to state 1 (state 3) is \ninitialized as 9\/12 (0\/12). Other transition initialization \nvalues are calculated similarly.  \nThe current health state of the system is represented by\n \nch in (3) and is obtained using the clustering method. \nNote that the \u221e in the formula is represented as the RUL \nupper limit in the SSBP. As the upper limit increases, the \napproximation of the RUL improves. The probability of \nthe RUL of each value between 1 and the RUL upper \nlimit is calculated one by one. For a given RUL, there \nexist many different combinations of possible health \nstates. For example, if the RUL is given as 5 with 3 health \nstates, the combinations are as follows: 3 1 1 (i.e., 3 time \nunit in state 1, and 1 time unit in state 2 and state 3), 2 2 1, \n2 1 2, 1 3 1, 1 2 2, and 1 1 3. The number of combinations \nincreases exponentially with the number of health states. \nTo handle the computations, transitions are only allowed \nfrom a health state to itself or to a consecutive state.  \nThus, a state cannot jump to second, third, and so on, \nconsecutive health states directly. The probability of \nstaying in a health state n for \nnst  times means that the \nhealth state transitions to itself 1\u2212nst times and \ntransitions to the consecutive health state one time. The \ncalculation is given in (6). \n[ ] ( )\u2211\n\u221e\n=\n==\u00d7==\n1\n||\ni\ncc hstirulPihstRUL   (3) \n( ) ( )\u220f\n=\n====\nfail\nhn\nnn ststayPhstiRULP |  (4) \nist\nfail\nhn\nn =\u2211\n=\n            (5)     \n        \n( ) ( )nnstnnnn qqststayP n ,1, 1\u2212== \u2212      (6)    \n The Monte Carlo simulation with HMM used in [28] \ndoes not make the assumption of transition of a state only \nto itself or the consecutive state.

Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model \nThe Hierarchical HMM (HHMM) is a version of the \nHidden Markov Model (HMM) designed to model \nhierarchical structures for sequential data. The simplest \nHHMM includes two hidden layers; the state in the top \nhidden layer is considered to be a self-contained \nprobabilistic model. In other words, in the simplest \nHHMM, each state in the top layer  is itself an HMM. The \nobserved state is affected by both nodes in the top and low \nhidden layer in any given time frame. The states in the top \nhidden layer represent the health states of the turnout \nsystem, whereas states in the low hidden layer represent \nthe state of the movement of the rails. In other words, the \nlow level states show the location of the rail during the \nback and forth movement of the rail. Readers are referred \nto [8] and [28] for the details of HHMM.  \nInitialization of HHMM  \nAn HHMM model is represented as \u03bb  ( ( ), ,A B\u03bb pi= ) \nand includes parameters of initial probabilities ( pi ), \ntransition probabilities ( A ), and observation probability \ndistributions ( B ). The following paragraphs discuss the \ninitialization of parameters in an HHMM. \n Initial probabilities ( pi ) exist for two hidden variables: \ntop and sub-hidden states. Top hidden states represent the \nhealth state of the turnout system. The initial probability \nof a top state is the probability of a turnout system to be in \na given health state for the first usage or after \nmaintenance\/repair. This is always 1 for a brand new state \n(and also after maintenance assuming perfect \nmaintenance) and 0 for other states. The data collected \nduring the movement of the rails with force generated by \nthe turnout system is in the form of a time series and \nconsists of several states (i.e., sub-states). The initial \nprobability of a sub-state is the probability of sub-states in \nthe beginning of the movement. In our experiments, the \ninitial probabilities are assumed to be 1 for the first top \nand sub-states and 0 for the other states. That is, the \nperfect maintenance assumption is made, and all turnout \nmovements are assumed to start from the same sub-state.  \n \nTable 1. Turnout health states progression examples \nThe top state transition probabilities are initialized \nusing the transition probabilities obtained using k-means \nclustering as discussed above. The other transition \nprobability parameter is the probability of the current sub-\nstate to change. To initialize this parameter, the time \nseries data collected during the rail movement are divided \ninto equal number of successive groups: s that also is the \nnumber of sub-states. Then 2\n, jiA  is initialized as follows: \nsA ii \/1\n2\n1, =+ , sA ii \/11\n2\n,\n\u2212= , and 02\n,\n=jiA  ji,\u2200   \nji \u2260  and 1+\u2260 ij .  \nThe last parameter to be initialized is the observation \nprobability distribution parameter, \n ,i jB , which represents \nthe distribution parameters of the observed parameter \nunder health state i  and sub-state j . To initialize\n ,i jB , \nthe data points that are collected from a turnout system \nwith each health state and sub-state are categorized. The \ndata from all of the h s\u00d7  categories are obtained, where \nh  and s  are the number of health and sub-states, \nrespectively. Then, the distribution parameters (i.e., mean \nand standard deviation) of the data in each category are \ncalculated and used as initialization values for\n ,i jB .   \nIV. EXPERIMENT & RESULTS \nThe presented method (SSBP) is applied to data \ncollected from a turnout system of the Turkish State \nRailways located in Babaeski, Tekirdag. The following \nsubsections discuss the data collection, failure \nprogression, and results of the SSBP.  \nA. Data Collection \nThe system used for data collection is an electro-\nmechanical type turnout with two drive rods, one for each \nrail. Nine sensors were installed in the turnout system: \ntwo force sensors for each drive rod, one current, two \nvoltage (separate sensors for forward and backward \nmovement), two proximity sensors for each rail and two \nlinear rulers for each drive rod. The most commonly used \nsensors in the literature are current and force sensors [24]. \nForce sensors are electrical sensing devices that are used \nto measure tension and compression forces. Tension cells \nare used for measuring a straight-line force \"pulling apart\" \nalong a single axis; the force is typically denoted as \npositive.  Compression tension cells are used for \nmeasurement of a straight-line force \"pushing together\" \nalong a single axis; the force is typically annotated \nas negative. Current sensors measure DC current levels. \nThey receive current inputs and provide outputs as analog \nvoltage signals, analog current levels, switches, or audible \nsignals. Voltage sensors are used to measure voltage in \nelectric circuits. Proximity sensors measure the distance \nbetween the stock rail and switch rail of railway turnout \nsystems. A linear position measuring sensor is installed on \nstretchers of the turnout system and measures the linear \nposition of the switch rails. Time series data are acquired \nfrom both normal to reverse and reverse to normal \nmovements of a turnout system. Figs. 6 shows the sensors \ninstalled in turnout system.  \nB. Failure Progression Mechanism  \nThere are multiple failure modes in a turnout system. \nThe dry slide chair failure mode is the most frequently \noccurring failure in turnout systems [22]. Slide chairs are \nthe metal platforms installed on twelve wooden traverses, \non which the rail is located, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Slide \nchairs are oiled periodically and in a fault-free system \nthese slide chairs are oily.  \nSwitch rails move back and forth on the slide chairs on \nthe twelve traverses.  They move around 17.5 cm on the \nslide chair located on the traverse closest to the turnout \nsystem. As the traverse gets far away from the turnout \nsystem, the movement on that traverse gets smaller. When \ndry\/contaminated slide chair failure modes occur, the \nfriction in the slide chair increases, leading to increased \nforce in the force sensors and changes in voltage and \ncurrent signals in the motor. In addition, the time to \ncomplete the movement may increase.  \n  \nThe failure progression from the fault-free health state \nto the failure health state is modeled using the exponential \ndegradation mentioned. The natural progression of the \nfailure mode occurs over a long period of time due to \nweather and environmental effects. Thus, it is not practical \nto wait and observe the natural progression of the failure \nmode. In addition, if the failure progresses naturally, the \nobservation of health states becomes very difficult, if not \nimpossible. In this work, the progression of the dry slide \nchair failure mode is modeled. \n \nFig. 6. Sensors used for data collection installed in turnout systems \n \nFig. 7. Modeling the Dry\/Contaminated Slide Chair Failure Mode \nThe failure state is defined as the state when all twelve \nslide chairs are dry or contaminated. The slide chairs have \nnot been lubricated for a long time to obtain the failure \nstate. The data from the failure state are collected. Then, \nthe slide chairs in the three farthest traverses from the \nturnout system are oiled, and data are collected. Then, the \nnext farthest traverse is oiled, and data are collected. The \noiling and collection of data is repeated one by one from \nthe farthest to the closest slide chairs of the turnout system \nuntil all slide chairs are oiled.  All of the slide chairs are \noily in the final state, which represents the fault-free state. \nThis is achieved in ten steps, each step representing a \nhealth state in the failure progression. As a result, many \nsamples from ten health states are obtained. At this point, \nthe life of a turnout system and the time spent in each \nhealth state in the failure progression are obtained using \nexponential degradation modeling with the following \nparameters: 1=\u03c6 , 8.0=\u03b2\u00b5\n, \n1.0=\u03b2\u03c3 .  \nAn example of current and force signals among ten \nturnout systems that progress from fault-free to failure \nstates with various lives is shown in Fig 8. As seen from \nthis figure, 13 samples are collected from this turnout \nsystem from fault-free to failure state. In other words, its \nlife is 13 units. One can observe the change in the current \nand force signals as the failure progresses.   \nThis paper uses only the dry slide chair failure mode for \nthe case study and all other conditions, such as operating \nconditions and wear in the components of the turnout \nsystem, are assumed to remain constant. This is a \nreasonable assumption because all the data are collected in \none day, and the dry slide chair failure mode is obtained \nunnaturally as mentioned above.   \n \n \nFig. 8. a) Current b) Force signals with failure \nprogression from \u2018fault free\u2019 state to \u2018close to failure\u2019state \nC. Results  \nThe samples are divided into training and testing \ngroups, with 80% of the samples in the training and the \nrest in the testing group. The training data are clustered \nusing the number of clusters from two to ten, and the CH \ncluster validity index is calculated and displayed in Fig. 9. \nThe maximum of the evaluation function (which indicates \nthe best number of clusters found) occurs at eight clusters. \nThus, failure progression should be modeled with eight \nhealth states. Note that when the failure progression was \nmodeled, ten unnatural health states were used. When \nanalyzing the health state clustering results, it is observed \nthat health states 8, 9, and 10 are combined into one \nhealth state. This is logical considering the variance \nincrease in the states close to failure. However, the best \nhealth state number found will be checked with \n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nLife of the turnout\nCu\nrr\nen\nt\nA\nsample\nFailure Progresses\nFault \nFree \nState\nClose to\nFailure\nState\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\nLife of the turnout\nF\no\nr\nc\ne\n(b)\nA\nsample\nClose to\nFailure state\nFault \nFree \nState\nFailure Progresses\nTraverse 1 \nTraverse 2 \nSlide \nChairs \n(a) Force Sensors (b) Linear Ruler Sensor \n(c) Proximity Sensors (d) Motor Current Sensors \nInstalled Sensors on Turnout System \n  \nforecasting effectiveness to validate the result obtained \nwith the cluster validity index.  \nTwo models (i.e., the SSBP and the HHMM model) are \nanalyzed: samples from the training and testing data are \nselected, the health states are identified and health state \nforecasting is performed for both methods. Transition \nprobabilities from both models are extracted, and the \nexpected remaining useful life is calculated as discussed \nin section III.  \n \n \nFig. 9. Evaluation of the number of clusters \nThe effectiveness of the estimated RUL (RULe) is \ncalculated by comparing the RULe with the real RUL \n(RULr). The real and estimated RULs calculated using \nHHMM-based prognostics and the SSBP are displayed for \nten turnout systems in Fig. 10. Each graph represents one \nof the turnout systems. The x-axis represents the age of \nthe system, whereas the y-axis represents the remaining \nuseful life of the system. The dashed line represents the \nreal RUL of the system given the current age. Note that \nthe sum of the x-axis and y-axis for the real RUL gives the \nlife of the system. The solid line represents the estimated \nRUL.  \n \nFig. 10. RULr and RULe for ten turnout systems with HHMM and SSBP \nThe root mean square error (RMSE) and r-square \nvalues between real RUL (RULr) and RULe are used as \nmeasures to evaluate the effectiveness of the prognostic \nmethod in [26] and [30]. Figs. 11 displays the RMSE (Fig \n11.a) and r-square (Fig 11.b) between the RULr and RULe \nobtained with HHMM and SSBP. The x-axis represents \nthe turnout systems, whereas the y-axis gives the RMSE \nand r-square values. It was expected that HHMMs would \noutperform the presented simple prognostics method, but \nthe opposite was true. The RMSE values are smaller and \nthe r-square values are greater for the presented method. \nOne can conclude that the optimization within HHMM \nduring training makes the parameters worse from a \nprognostics perspective, considering its design and \ntechnical requirements.  \n \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \n \nFig. 11.  Comparison of SSBP and HHMM using a) RMSE b) R-\nsquare \nThe presented method is very simple and outperforms \nHHMM-based prognostics. As a disadvantage, the \npresented method has restrictions on state transitions that \nallow transition of a state only to itself and a consecutive \nstate.  \n \nFig 12. r-square values for different numbers of health states \n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nCalinski-Harabasz\n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n10\n20\nTurnout System 1\n0 5 10 15\n0\n10\n20\nTurnout System 2\n0 5 10 15\n0\n10\n20\nTurnout System 3\n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n10\n20\nTurnout System 4\n0 5 10 15\n0\n10\n20\nTurnout System 5\n0 5 10 150\n10\n20\nTurnout System 6\n0 5 10 15\n0\n10\n20\nTurnout System 7\n0 5 10 15\n0\n10\n20\nTurnout System 8\n0 5 10 150\n10\n20\nTurnout System 9\n0 5 10 15 200\n10\n20\nTurnout System 10\nSystem Current Age\nEx\npe\nct\ne\nd \nR\nUL\n \n \nReal RUL\nSSBP\nHHMM\n0,00\n0,50\n1,00\n1,50\n2,00\n2,50\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nSSBP\nHHMM\n0,75\n0,80\n0,85\n0,90\n0,95\n1,00\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nSSBP\nHHMM\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nNumber of Health States\nr-\nsq\nu\na\nre\n \n \nSSBP\nHHMM\n  \n \nFig. 12 displays the r-square values of RULr and RULe \nfor different health states.

Note that \neight health states were recommended by the CH cluster \nvalidity index. Thus, the prognostics results support the \nresult of the CH cluster validity index.  \nV. CONCLUSION \nFailures often go through several states before making \nthe system unusable. It is critical to identify and forecast \nthese health states as the failure progresses for effective \nusage of the system. Railway turnouts are one of the most \nimportant components of railway infrastructure. Although \nseveral studies on failure identification in turnout systems \nare present in the literature, health state estimation and \nforecasting have not been reported. One of the most \nimportant difficulties in failure progression analysis is the \ninability to observe the natural progression of failures due \nto time constraint. Failures occur slowly and obtaining \nstatistically enough failure progression data may take \nyears. This paper presents a strategy to collect data with a \ngiven failure degradation model. Then, a simple \nprognostic method (SSBP) is presented. SSBP and \nHHMM based prognostic methods are applied to data \nobtained from a turnout system in the Turkish State \nRailway and their results are compared. The presented \nmethod outperforms the HHMM-based prognostics in the \npaper. In addition, a validation strategy for health state \nestimation is presented in the paper.  \nREFERENCES \n[1]   EU Corporate Responsibility Report, 2005 \n[2]  Directive 2001\/12\/EC of the European Parliament and of the \nCouncil of 26 February 2001 amending Council Directive \n91\/440\/EEC on the development of the Community\u2019s railways \nOfficial, L75 of 15 March 2001, SIN 1012-9200 \n[3]    Directive 2001\/13\/EC of the European Parliament and of the \nCouncil of 26 February 2001 amending Council Directive \n95\/18\/EC on the licensing of railway undertaking, L75 of 15 \nMarch 2001, SIN 1012-9200 \n[4]    Directive 2001\/14\/EC of the European Parliament and of the \nCouncil of 26 February 2001 amending Council Directive \n91\/440\/EEC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity \nand the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure \nand safety certification, L75 of 15 March 2001, SIN 1012-9200 \n[5]  Garcia Marquez, F., Lewis, W.R., Tobias, M.A., Roberts, C., Life \ncycle costs for railway condition monitoring, Transport Res.
