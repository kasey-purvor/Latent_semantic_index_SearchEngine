While this is a feature and growing conflict \nfor every form of authored work \u2013 news, films, books, academic work, photography, the \nfocus here is on music and more in particular on the sharing of music. Sharing music is not a \nnew phenomenon, but current copyright users share music with weak peers in addition to \nstrong peers which has taken sharing to a whole different level reminiscent of a gift-culture, \nbut with less need for reciprocity. Music audiences attribute less value to a digital product \nthan to an artefact such as a CD or vinyl record. The reaction of the music industry to these \nphenomena has been hostile up until now, criminalising the copyright user and lobbying for \nthe close monitoring of the online behaviour of all internet users. However, while the industry \nforegrounds its potential losses based on the number of downloads, as well as the difficulties \nthis provokes for young beginning artists, others are pointing towards the societal benefits of \nworldwide free access to such a wide variety of music. Furthermore, several counter-voices in \nthe copyright debate have emerged, from copyleft to copyriot and more and more artists \nmainstream and alternative are engaging fully with the participatory culture. In this \ncommentary an argument is developed in favour of the music industry embracing this \nparticipatory networked culture rather than take us back to the future of 1984. Democracy \nand civic liberties are more important than the corporate interests of a few. \n \nWordcount:  \n \n4961 (Refs and Notes Included) \n 2 \nThe hegemonic copyright-regime vs. the \nsharing copyright users of music? \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe tensions between the current hegemonic copyright regime and new \npatterns of consumption and use of music has engendered a lot of debate in \nacademia, amongst legal scholars, corporate actors and in the media. \nDigitalisation, compression techniques and the internet as a potent \ndistribution tool have provided the music industry tremendous benefits in \nterms of reducing production, reproduction and distribution costs, but at the \nsame time these technologies have also a deterritorialising effect, \nundermining the current stringent copyright and intellectual property regime.  \n \nWhile the industry still clings on to a past when music symbolised at the same \ntime an artefact \u2013 a physical material product, music audiences have long \nmoved on and differentiate in the value they attribute to a digital product \ncompared to a physical product, even if the content is the same. Sharing \nmusic, which is not an entirely new phenomenon, has shifted from strong-\npeers to weak peers enabled by networked technologies. We have also \nentered an era in which music plays a different role in people\u2019s everyday life, \nis more ephemeral - \u2018its duration becomes compressed, and it becomes more \nof a process than a finished product\u2019 (Terranova, 2000: 48). Music has \nbecome ubiquitous through mobile devices and the internet and quantity is \noften more important than quality. As a result of all this and despite all the \nfrantic efforts by the industry to put a stop to the downloading and sharing of \ncopy-right protected music, music audiences are less and less willing to pay \nfor the music they listen to (Molteni and Ordanini, 2003; Leyshon et al., \n2005).  \n \nWhat we are witnessing here is a good illustration of the widening of the gap \nbetween what is called le pays legal and le pays r\u00e9el, between the laws and \nregulations put in place by the state and what is deemed to be acceptable \nand normal behaviour on the part of citizens\/consumers. This growing \ndiscrepancy between the legal and the everyday world in relation to music is \nexplored further by first outlining the nature of the hegemonic copyright \nregime and its gradual universalisation as well as expansion, both in scope \nand in duration. After this, new patterns of sharing music that challenge this \nhegemonic copyright regime will be addressed to then focus on the tactics of \nthe industry to discipline these practices. Finally, counter-voices in the \nintellectual property and copyright debate advocating for a strengthening of \nthe public domain will be outlined.  \n \n \n 3 \nThe hegemonic copyright regime \n \nHistorically, old folk culture did not recognise ownership of culture \u2013 \n\u2018performance was regarded more highly than authorship\u2019 (S\u00f6derberg, 2002: \nnp). Cultures thrived on the sharing of stories that got adapted, transformed, \nbut could not be traced back anymore to a single author. Foucault (1986: \n108) points out that discourse was not \u2018a product, a thing, a kind of goods\u2019.  \n \nThe first formalisation of copyright and authorship can be situated in 1710 \nwhen the Statute of Anne - An Act for the Encouragement of Learning - was \nvoted in the UK (Rimmer, 2007: 4). It enabled authors to exert their rights on \nnewly produced work and gave them the exclusive rights to print and sell \ntheir work for a finite time span, with a maximum of 28 years if the author \nwas still alive. The Statute of Anne created a public domain for literature and \nsought to strike a balance between the advancement of knowledge and \nincentives for the creation and creators of culture; it was a social contract in \nsorts (Deazley, 2004). Limits on the duration of copyright protection were put \nin place to promote and protect the public domain as much as the author.  \n \nIntellectual property and copyright protection was subsequently slowly but \nsurely universalised through a number of conventions and binding \nagreements. The Paris Convention for the Protection of Intellectual Property \nin 1883, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic \nWorks in 1886, the establishment of World Intellectual Property Organisation \n(WIPO) in 1967, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \nProperty Rights (TRIPS) in 1995 were all geared up to universalize intellectual \nproperty and copyright protection. The universalisation of copyright protection \nis also at the core of the ideology of free and fair trade embedded in the \nGATT and the WTO (Bettig, 1996). Legal copyright protection became the \ncornerstone and prime vehicle through which the commodification of culture \u2013 \n\u2018the process of transforming use values into exchange values\u2019 (Mosco, 1996: \n141) \u2013 has been institutionalised and enforced. \n \nTwo historical trends can be identified. The first observable trend is that the \ncopyright regime has been gradually expanded from pure texts and print to \nencompass any possible form of cultural production \u2013 paintings, engravings, \nphotographs, music, film, broadcasts, theatre, etc. Most national\/regional \ncopyright laws and international agreements have also been updated to \ninclude the latest forms of digital reproduction and creation. In this regard \ncan be referred to the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the US and \nthe 2001 European Union Copyright Directive.  \n \nA second marked trend is the considerable extension of the duration of \ncopyright entitlements on cultural products in recent decades (see figure 1). \nOne of its ground rules of The Berne convention established that copyright \nholders could assert their rights for a minimum term of the lifetime of the \nauthor plus 50 years. Initially the US did not sign up to the Berne convention. \n \n 4 \nIn subsequent decades the US overtook Europe in terms of the prime \nadvocate for copyright protection in order to protect the interests of their \nentertainment industry. Of great importance here is the distinction between \nauthors\u2019 copyright and corporate copyright1. Since 1993 in Europe a general \nrule was adopted, namely 70 years after an author\u2019s death (Von Hielmcrone, \n2000: 31). In the US, The 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), also \ndubbed the Sonny Bono or Mickey Mouse Protection Act, drastically extended \ncopyright protection in the US from 50 to 70 after the author\u2019s life, in line with \nthe EU directive, but the terms for corporate ownership or \u2018work for hire\u2019 were \nraised to 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication. (Rimmer, \n2007) \n \n \nFigure 1: Overview of changes in the terms for copyright protection in \nUK\/Europe and in US from 1710-20102 \n \nSource: made by the author, based on legal changes over this period in \nEurope and the US \n \n \nNew forms of sharing music: the peer2peer model \n \nThe emergence of a more participatory consumption culture, freely sharing \ndigital content online, makes that \u2018the older legal and economic structures \nthat insure commodification on the basis of authorship are disintegrating \nbefore our eyes\u2019 (Poster, 2004: 421). At the core of this is the phenomenon of \nsharing digital content amongst (weak) peers.  \n \nWhilst online file-sharing \u2013 or what Liebowitz (2006: 4) calls \u2018anonymous file \ncopying\u2019 \u2013 is a relatively new phenomenon, sharing music as such is not. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n120\n17\n10\n17\n80\n17\n90\n18\n00\n18\n10\n18\n20\n18\n30\n18\n40\n18\n50\n18\n60\n18\n70\n18\n80\n18\n90\n19\n00\n19\n10\n19\n20\n19\n30\n19\n40\n19\n50\n19\n60\n19\n70\n19\n80\n19\n90\n20\n00\n20\n10\nUK\/Europe US US-Corporate\n 5 \nReel-to-reel tapes and music cassettes for example enabled the copying of \nmusic onto another format for many years. After the introduction of music \ncassettes to the consumer market in the 60s and 70s, \u2018making a tape\u2019 became \ncommonplace and was for many conducive to discovering new music and \nmaking new (girl)friends (Frith, 1986). In this type of strong-tie sharing of \nmusic kinships, friends, school, the local youth-club, (local) radio stations \nand\/or the local record store were highly influential as to which music \nteenagers and young adults were exposed to and shared amongst friends. \nHowever, sharing today is of an entirely different magnitude and nature. One \nmight argue that we have entered an era of weak-tie sharing of music.  \n \nPeer-to-peer file sharing is in a sense a potent illustration of the collective \n\u2018strength of very weak ties\u2019 (Granovetter, 1983) in densely networked \nenvironments. The network structure as well as the global nature of the \ninternet makes it possible to share among anonymous and invisible publics \nthat are not connected in any other way besides sharing data online (Lessig, \n2004: 17). File-sharing technology has \u2018facilitated much greater user \nparticipation in what had previously been an arcane \u201cgift economy\u201d \ndominated by enthusiasts and hobbyists\u2019 (Currah, 2006: 443). \n \nIn his classic anthropological study The Gift, Mauss (1950) sets forth a theory \nregarding gifts and the act of giving and closely relates this to the notion of \nreciprocity. S\/he who gives, often expects something in return at some point \nand while this leads to a re-enforcement of social relations and cohesion, \nMauss argues that this also ferments social dependencies and reproduces \nexisting power relations. However, with the emergence of digital technologies \nand the internet, in combination with the strength of weak ties, the element \nof reciprocity, strong social ties and asymmetrical power relations, while still \nrelevant, have become less of an issue or can partially be overcome (Kollock, \n1999: 223). Whether we share with a few or with thousands, millions even \ndoes not really matter that much in terms of transaction costs. This also \nexplains some of the differences between the act of giving in a material world \nas described by Mauss and giving in an immaterial peer-to-peer model. \n \nAccording to the international industry lobby groups, the music industry and \nthe artists lost out on more than 40 Billion US$ in revenue in 2008 because of \npiracy and (illegal) file-sharing. Besides this, they estimate that 95% of music \nbeing downloaded online constitute in fact illicit downloads (IFPI, 2009: 22). \nIt is generally accepted that the projections of losses due to peer-to-peer \nsharing of music are greatly exaggerated by the lobby organisations \n(Ziemann, 2002, 2007; Liebowitz, 2006: 13). Despite this, the majority of \n(econometric) studies into file-sharing conclude that this activity is plainly \nrather than creatively destructive and has \u2018brought significant harm to the \nrecording industry\u2019 (Liebowitz, 2006: 24) and is detrimental for the \u2018creation \nof artistic work or innovation\u2019 (Zetner, 2006: 65). \n \n \n 6 \nDisciplining tactics of the entertainment industries  \n \nPrecisely because \u2018[t]he network doesn\u2019t discriminate between the sharing of \ncopyrighted and uncopyrighted content\u2019 (Lessig 2004: 18), the entertainment \nindustries\u2019 lobby organisations, as well as some artists, are very adamant in \ntheir resistance against these \u2018immaterial\u2019 sharing-practices employed by \ncopyright users, which they depict as illegal piracy and blatant theft. The \nmain tactics currently being enacted by the entertainment industries are \nthree-fold:  \n \n(1) protection  \n(2) education and intimidation \n(3) repression \n \nProtection refers to Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies, such as \ndigital watermarks, as developed by the Secure Digital Music Initiative or \nApple\u2019s Fair Play DRM, which technically restricts the use of copyrighted \ncontent, both online and on devices such as MP3-players. These techniques \nhave proven to be not that successful as hacks to circumvent protection are \noften quickly available and furthermore not all content producers use it on all \ntheir products. Apple calculated that on average under 3% of all content \nstored on iPods is DRM protected. This represents one of DRMs main \nweakness, according to Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple: \n \nDRMs haven\u2019t worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy. \nThough the big four music companies require that all their music sold \nonline be protected with DRMs, these same music companies continue \nto sell billions of CDs a year which contain completely unprotected \nmusic. [\u2026] the technical expertise and overhead required to create, \noperate and update a DRM system has limited the number of \nparticipants selling DRM protected music. (Jobs, 2007: np) \n \nA second tactic the industry employs is that of educating the masses and this \nrefers to programs and campaigns that have been set-up to \u2018close the \n\u201cknowledge gap\u201d between young people and their parents and teachers, in \norder to promote the safe and legal use of the internet and mobile phones to \ndownload music\u2019 (IFPI, 2009: 26). However, many of these PR campaigns do \nnot aim to educate, but above all to intimidate. Through the discourses being \nproduced by lobby organisations in their PR-campaigns3 the criminalisation of \nthe sharing copyright user is being articulated. On the website of the Alliance \nAgainst IP Theft (see Figure 2) illegal downloading and piracy is discursively \nand visually linked to drug dealing, sweatshops, child labour, illegal \nimmigration and organised crime.  \n \n \n 7 \nFigure 2: Screenshot of website of the Alliance Against IP Theft \n \n \nSource: http:\/\/www.allianceagainstiptheft.co.uk  \n \nIn recent years it became apparent that education and waving a stick was \ninsufficient to deter the sharing of digital content. More radical strategies of \nrepression were gradually enacted by the entertainment industries. First \nvictims of their legal challenges were those facilitating the downloading and \npeer-to-peer sharing of digital content. A famous case in this regard was \nNapster, which was forced to close down and subsequently convert to a \nsubscription model (McCourt and Burkhart, 2003). The pressure on MySpace \nand YouTube to remove copyrighted material from their sites and the gradual \ncompliance of these sites to these requests certainly after having been \nappropriated by major players is another illustration of the attempts to assert \nthe universal copyright hegemony online.  \n \nAs the internet was precisely designed to be versatile in adapting to and \nbypassing disruptions, new loopholes emerge very rapidly, making it near \nimpossible for the content industries to keep up with innovations in terms of \ncontent distribution among peers and new ways of circumventing DRM \nprotections. Different peer-to-peer sites and software applications are now \navailable that do not require a central server anymore and are thus \nimpossible to eliminate (e.g Kazaa, Limewire, Bit-Torrent). Blogs are \nincreasingly used as a way to provide links to file-share sites such as \nRapidShare or Hotfile from where music or software can be downloaded.  \n \nAs a result of this, the entertainment industries re-directed their efforts to \nenforce copyright towards individual downloaders and sharers. Despite claims \nof the industry lobby organisations that they would only target \u2018individual \ncomputer users who are illegally offering large amounts of copyrighted music \n 8 \nover peer-to-peer networks\u2019 (RIAA, 2009 \u2013 emphasis added), many cases \nbeing pursued by the RIAA do not fall into that category. According to the \nElectronic Freedom Foundation, the RIAA sued about 30.000 US individuals \nbetween 2003 and 2008; many of whom were not malign or severe users, but \n\u2018children, grandparents, unemployed single mothers, college professors\u2019, \nhaving downloaded only a very limited number of music (EFF, 2008). Through \nhigh-profile cases the entertainment industry aims to scare internet users. \nThis is confirmed by the comments of the lawyer of the RIAA in the case \nagainst Jamie Thomas, a single mother of two, who was convicted to pay \n220.000$ in damages to the RIAA for downloading and sharing 24 tracks: \n\u2018This does send a message, we hope, that both downloading and distributing \nmusic is not ok.\u2019 (Richard Gabriel, quoted in Bangeman, 2007: np).  \n \nThe third and most recent actor being targeted by the entertainment \nindustries are the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), considered to be complicit \nin copyright infringements by internet users. ISPs are increasingly asked to \npolice and monitor their network and hand over information about the \ndownload behaviour of their customers (BBC, 2008). In the UK, the Digital \nBritain report, proposed to give the regulator Ofcom additional powers to \nforce internet providers to report persistent misuse. (DCMS, 2009). Contrary \nto France, where the National Assembly narrowly stopped a stringent internet \nanti-piracy law disconnecting internet users after three infringements, as well \nas requiring them to keep paying their subscription (BBC, 2009), in the UK \nthe fierce battle to curb illegal downloading or anonymous file-sharing of \ncopyrighted content is opening the door to a state-sanctioned monitoring \nsystem of the internet usage of everyone and of the content that is being \ndownloaded and\/or shared.  \n \n \nCounter-voices in the IP-debate \n \nAs is apparent, other voices besides the music industry and governments are \nalso active in this debate. One of the main counter-arguments distinguishes \npeer-to-peer sharing from piracy with a commercial intent. It is being argued \nthat peer-to-peer sharing involves gaining a private benefit, while at the same \ntime providing benefits to others, which above all takes place outside of the \nvalue-chain as no money is exchanged (Jenkins, 2003), very reminiscent to \nthe discourses related to the culture of gifts.  \n \nLessig (2004: 201), one of the most influential voices in developing counter \nperspectives on copyright and a more participatory culture, argues that if the \n\u2018costs [of enforcing the law more severely], intended and collateral, do \noutweigh the benefits, then the law ought to be changed\u2019. This should result \nin the emergence of different types of intellectual property regimes allowing \nfor different degrees of freedom and above all establishing an intellectual and \ncreative commons (Lessig, 2004: 204; Bollier, 2009).  \n \n 9 \nThere exist a variety of alternative copyright licences of which the 1989 \nGeneral Public License (GPL); also known as the Copyleft license (see figure \n3) and the 2002 Creative Commons ShareAlike licenses which were inspired \nby the GPL, are the most common. The GPL license was originally developed \nby Richard Stallman to suit the needs of the Free Software Movement, but it \ncan be used for all kinds of copyright protected works and creations. Copy-left \nlicences use \u2018copyright law, but flips it over to serve the opposite purpose\u2019 \n(Stallman, 1999: 59). Information is placed into the public domain while \ncopyright law makes sure that it stays there and cannot be commodified. \n \nFigure 3: Copy-left Logo \n \n  \n \nSource: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Copyleft.svg (Public Domain) \n \nFor some this radical move went too far, leading to the emergence of more \nflexible \u2013 or rather more restrictive \u2013 licenses. For example, Open Source \nlicenses4 are somewhat different from the GPL in that they restrict what you \ncan actually do with the material, while GPL leaves the user free to do what \ns\/he wants with the licensed material, except commodifying it (Stallman, \n2007). Open source licenses are generally seen to be more business friendly \n(S\u00f6derberg, 2002). Likewise, Creative Commons\u2019 licenses, co-developed by \nLessig (2003), enables authors to impose a variety of restrictions on work \nplaced in the public domain, they can choose whether they allow sharing, \ncommercial use, and the creation of derivatives from the original or not. \n \nIt is, however, a misconception to think that the Copyleft\/Open Source \nmovement somehow operates beyond or outside the logic, regime and \nideology of copyright protection. On the contrary, one of the strengths of \nStallman and others is precisely that they remain within a fairly legalistic \nframework, which is helpful in a context where \u2013 often unassumingly \u2013 \nconsumers sign legal contracts with content producers when purchasing or \naccessing cultural products.  \n \nNevertheless, this strictly legalistic approach contrasts with the more \nnormative and sociological position taken by Rob and Waldfogel (2006) and \nOberholzer and Strumpf (2007) foregrounding the societal benefits of \n 10 \nanonymous file-sharing, regardless of the legal implications of this. Two \ncitizenship models clearly clash here \u2013 citizenship as a legal status with rights \nand obligations, governed by the rule of law versus cultural and political \ncitizenship, where citizens have the right to resist, to fundamentally challenge \nlaws and to refuse to abide by them legitimised by public interests. From this \nlatter perspective laws can easily be perceived to protect the particularistic \n(capitalist) interests rather than serving and protecting the common good and \ncopyright laws are a very good example of this.  \n \nMore radical voices in this debate argue for a complete rejection of the notion \nof copyright all together, rather than to reason from within an IP and\/or \ncopyright paradigm, as does the Copy-left movement. Rasmus Fleischer, one \nof the co-founders of Swedish Bit-torrent search engine The Pirate Bay and \nauthor of the blog Copyriot5, rejects copyright outright. He argues that the \n\u2018vision of copyright utopia is triggering an escalation of technology regulations \nrunning out of control and ruining civil liberties.\u2019 (Fleischer, 2008: np). He and \nothers increasingly point to the price we as a society are paying for \u2018upholding \nthe phantasm of universal copyright\u2019 (ibid).  \n \nBesides this, we are also seeing that some artists have started to emphasise \nthe advantages of the participatory culture instead of foregrounding the \ndetrimental aspects of it, making good use of its benefits to outweigh the \ncosts. Besides mainstream artists such as Prince and Radiohead, underground \nscenes are increasingly developing more innovative ways of creating added \nvalue other than selling records and CDs. More dance-oriented scenes for \nexample thrive on symbolic capital, label recognition and the sharing of \nrevenues of DJ-ing and live performances with the labels (Webb, 2007). \nSocial media and the participatory culture feed into this and are thus not seen \nas something necessarily negative. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nWhile music audiences increasingly consider music and other digital content \nimmaterial and ephemeral, without real value compared to a physical product, \nthe entertainment industries clearly stick to a physical and material world \nwhere a culture of exchange clashes head on with a collective culture of \ndistributed taking and giving. This tension and deepening conflict is \nincreasingly unsettling the capitalistic paradigm in the production and \ncommercial exploitation of culture.  \n \nTo some extent digitalisation and the internet have brought us \u2018back to the \nfuture\u2019, to use the title of Robert Zemeckis\u2019 1985 movie. With some caveats it \ncould be argued that to the great dismay of the entertainment industries we \nare slowly returning to an oral era where culture only existed by the grace of \nsharing and the joy it provoked among its audiences, to a time in which \ncultural production had to be in the public domain or it did not exist, had no \npurpose, did not travel far. Poster (2004: 417) asserts that \u2018[w]hen cultural \n 11 \nobjects are digitized, they take on certain characteristics of spoken language\u2019 \nand as we know \u2018[t]he model of consumption does not fit practices of speech \nor singing\u2019. This is a pertinent point, salient in relation to music in particular \nand concurrent with the analysis developed above. The question that arises \nthen is whether this is necessarily such a bad thing?  \n \nAs is apparent from the analysis above, opinions on this are starkly divided. \nFrom the perspective of the music industry and some artists file sharing is \nclearly detrimental and their claims are supported by most econometric \nstudies. From the perspective of users and society, file sharing can be \narticulated as highly beneficial to a participatory culture, strengthening the \npublic domain, facilitating access for the many to an immense variety of \ncultural products, providing exposure and symbolic capital to artists, at times \neven serendipitously and a potent marketing tool for musicians big and small.  \n \nThe point made here is that the genie is out of the bottle. It is becoming ever \nmore clear that the music industry will never be able to fully exploit the \nadvantages of the networked participatory culture while it is at the same time \nengaged in high profile efforts to contain, curtail and\/or destroy that very \nsame culture. They cannot engage fully in the emerging participatory culture, \nbut neither are they able to fully control, let alone destroy, the practices they \ncriminalise. One way out of this Catch22 is for the music industry to also \nbecome a participant. Maybe the time has come for the music industry to \nreconsider its hostile position towards the copyright users and approach them \nas fans and potential consumers rather than as criminals, in similar ways as \nquite a number of artists have started doing. \n \nHowever, a less romantic and more dystopian option is that the \nentertainment industries, driven by the vast interests they represent and the \ndetermined will to counter all fundamental challenges to the current \nownership-regime, will continue to fight the copyright users and the most \nfrightening way to do this is through monitoring the online activities of all \ninternet users, potentially through deep-packet inspection technology \n(Anderson, 2007). How else would internet service providers be able to detect \nand report persistent \u2018misuse\u2019? And how persistent does persistent misuse \nhave to be before we get reported? What other categories of misuse might be \nadded to downloading and sharing digital content?  \n \nIn terms of democracy, privacy and civil liberties it remains a daunting \nperspective to envisage a future in which a multiplicity of private little digital \nbig brothers will be monitoring our online behaviour in every detail looking for \nall kinds of misuses, ultimately disciplining us if we transgress a certain limit. \nRather than protect global conglomerates\u2019 interests and restricting access to \ncultural products, a future more in tune with the burgeoning participatory \nculture whilst at the same time providing alternative ways of supporting \nartists and promoting creativity, should be the aim.  \n 12 \nReferences: \n \nAlliance Against IP-Theft (2008) The Changing Nature of Intellectual Property: A Manifesto \nfor the Digital Age.

For example, publishers hold corporate authorship over academic \noutput, academics keep their moral rights and some fair use rights.   \n2 This graph represents the year in which legislation was changed but often this has \nretroactive consequences for works created earlier. In reality the rise in copyright terms is \neven more drastic as it appears. While at first copyright terms were absolute and expired \nwhen an author died, the Berne Convention of 1883 made it possible for descendents and \nothers to exert the copyrights for a maximum of 50 years after the author\u2019s death.  \n3 See http:\/\/www.fact-uk.org.uk or http:\/\/www.respectcopyrights.org for examples. \n4 See URL: http:\/\/opensource.org\/docs\/osd \n5 See URL: http:\/\/www.copyriot.se  \n"}
