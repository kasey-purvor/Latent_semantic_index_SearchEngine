Associated with this connection is a sharp-type solution of\nthe nonlinear partial differential equation.\n1. Introduction\nA wide range of wave behaviour has been observed in biological, ecological,\nphysiological, and chemical systems. For example, spiral waves of concentration\nwith one or multiple arms in chemical reactions, or of the density in the streaming\nbehaviour of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, scroll-like patterns in\nmyocardium muscle, pulses of voltage in nerve conduction, waves of invasion of\nbiological populations, and epizootic waves of disease spreading (see [5, 10, 17,\n18, 25, 26] and the references therein). Some of these phenomena can be\ndescribed by nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations (see [5,9,17], for example).\nIn many such cases, the observed waves can be approximated by waves moving in\nspace with a constant profile and speed. These are the so-called travelling waves.\nDifferent mathematical methods have been developed and used in analysing the\nexistence of travelling-wave solutions of systems of reaction-diffusion equations\nin one and higher dimensions (see [2,6,12,14,15,16,21,23,24], for example).\nThe classical example is due to Kolmogorov et al. (see [15]) in which the problem\nis restated in terms of finding the set of parameters (including the speed c) for\nwhich heteroclinic arid homoclinic trajectories exist of an autonomous ordinary-\ndifferential-equation (ODE) system in the travelling-wave variable.\nfDepartamento de Mathematicas, Facultad de Ciencias, UN AM, Circuiio Exterior, CU, Mexico\n04510, DF, Mexico.\n211\n\u00a9 Oxford University Press 1996\n2 1 2 FAUSTINO SANCHEZ-GARDUNO ET AL.\nSeveral authors (see [1,8,12,13,15]) have used the approach above to prove\nthe existence of different types of travelling-wave solutions for some nonlinear\nreaction-diffusion equations, such as the classical Fisher-KPP and Nagumo\nequations given by u, = [Z)MX]X + g(u), where D is a positive constant and g is a\nsecond- or third-order polynomial. For a strictly positive density-dependent\ndiffusion coefficient D, and when g is typically a second-order polynomial-like\nfunction, the problem of the existence of travelling-wave solutions is wholly\nsolved [7,13]. These authors proved that this equation has travelling-wave\nsolutions if and only if the equation u, = uxx + D(u)g(u) exhibits travelling-wave\nsolutions. By using the aforementioned methodology it has been proved [23] that\nunder certain conditions on D and g (see Section 2) the degenerate (at u = 0)\nequation u, = [D(u)ux]x + g(u) has: (i) a unique sharp travelling-wave solution for\na critical value, c*>0, of c; (ii) no travelling-wave solution for 0 < c < c * ; and\n(iii) a travelling-wave solution of monotonic decreasing front type for each c > c*.\nThe existence and uniqueness of a sharp-type solution for the equation with\n\u00a3)(\u00ab) = u and with g quadratic-like has been proved in [11].\nHere we prove a result on the existence and uniqueness of a travelling-wave\nsolution of the sharp type for equation (1); a different, less direct, proof can be\nfound in [23]. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we state the\nproblem and address some background results on the nonlinear local analysis and\nglobal behaviour of the trajectories of the ODE system for certain values of c.\nSection 3 deals with the proof of the existence of the saddle-saddle heteroclinic\ntrajectory. In Section 4 we present a result on the uniqueness of the saddle-\nsaddle connection. Corresponding to this trajectory is the sharp solution of the\nfull partial differential equation (PDE).\n2. The problem and some previous results\nThe problem we consider is that of looking for a travelling-wave solution\nu(x, t) = <f>(x -cf) = <\u00a3(\u00a3) of sharp type (see Definition 1) to the nonlinear,\ndegenerate (at u = 0), one-dimensional, reaction-diffusion equation\nwhere D and g are functions defined on [0,1] satisfying the following conditions:\n(i) 8(0) = g(l) = 0, g(u) > 0 Vu G (0,1),\n(ii) g e Cfo,n, g'(0)>0, g ' ( l )<0 ,\n(iii) D(0) = 0, \u00a3>(u) > 0 Vue (0, 1],\n(iv) D s Cfo.i], D'(u) > 0 V U E (0,1], with \u00a3>\"(0) * 0, \"\ntogether with the initial condition u(x, 0) = MO(X) such that 0 =\u00a3 MO(*) =\u00a3 1. Also we\nrequire O=\u00a30(\u00a3)=\u00a3l V\u00a3\nFor the biological and ecological motivation for analysing the above equation,\nsee [3,4,18,19,23]. Note that, because of condition (i), u,(x, r) = 0 and\nNONLINEAR DEGENERATE FISHER-KPP EQUATIONS 2 1 3\nu2(x, 0 = 1 are homogeneous and stationary solutions of (1). Thus it is natural to\nconsider those travelling-wave solutions of (1) which connect these two equilib-\nrium states.\nBefore we begin the analysis we introduce the following definition.\nDEFINITION 1 If there exists a value c* > 0 of the speed c and a value \u00a3* e\n(-oo, +oo) of \u00a3 such that u(x, t) = <f>(x - c*t) = <\u00a3(\u00a3) satisfies\n0 Vf \u00a3(-\u00bb ,\u00a3\u2022) , (2)\n2. <K-\u00b0\u00b0) = 0, 4>(p-) = <K\u00a3*+) = 0, and <K\u00a3) = 0 v \u00a3 e (f*. +00].\n3. ^ ' ( ^ - ) = - ^ , 4>'(f+) = 0, and <\u00a3'(\u00a3) < 0 V\u00a3 E (-CO, \u00a3*),\nthen the function u{x, t) = 0(J: - c*t) is called a travelling-wave solution of sharp\ntype for equation (1).\nBy substituting u{x, t) = <\u00a3(\u00a3) into (1) we obtain a second-order ODE of the\nform given by (2), which can be written, on introducing v = <\u00a3'(\u00a3), as the singular\n(at (f> = 0) system\n(3)\nwhere the primes on <{> and v denote the derivative with respect to \u00a3 and the\nprime on D denotes the derivative with respect to <f>. The singularity can be\nremoved by using a standard reparametrization (see [3,23]) of (3). Thus, letting r\nbe such that\ndr 1\nand defining <\u00a3(r) = $(\u00a3(r)) and U(T) = U(^(T)), we can rewrite (3) as the\nnonsingular system\nv=-cv-D'{4>yv2-g{<t>),\nwhere the overdots on <f> and v denote the derivative with respect to r. This\nsystem, together with the boundary conditions #(-\u00b0\u00b0) = l, u(-\u00b0\u00b0) = 0J and\n<\/>(+oo) = 0, with 0 S S < K T ) \u00ab 1 and u ( r )\u00ab0 V T E ( - \u00bb , + \u00bb ) , constitutes the\nrestatement of problem (1).\nIt can be proved that systems (3) and (5) give the same dynamics in the strip\n{(<\u00a3, u):0<<\u00a3=\u00a3l, \u2014 oo < u < +00}; that is, they are topologically equivalent in this\nregion of the ($, u)-plane.\n214 FAUSTINO SANCHEZ-GARDUNO ET AL.\nV A\n(b)\nFIG. 1. The local behaviour of the trajectories of (5) around each equilibrium point for different\nvalues of c: (a) c = 0, and (b) c > 0.\nWe begin the analysis by considering the local behaviour. System (5) has three\nequilibria: Po = (0,0), Px = (1,0), and Pc = (0, -c\/D'(0))\\ Pc and \/*, are hyper-\nbolic saddle points for all positive values of c; Po is a nonhyperbolic saddle-node\npoint which runs away monotonically on the negative u-axis as c increases. The\nlocal phase portrait of (5) is illustrated in Fig. 1. For full details of the nonlinear\nlocal analysis, see [23].\nFor the global phase portrait of (5) we introduce the following notation: W\"(P,)\nis the left unstable manifold of Pu and WC(PC) is the right stable manifold of Pc.\nWe also define the region $ = {(<\u00a3, v): 0=\u00a3 <f> =\u00a3l, -\u00b0o<i;=\u00a30}. We need the\nfollowing results which give us the global behaviour of W\"(\/>,) and WSC(PC) for\nsome values of c. The proof can be seen in [23].\nPROPOSITION 1 For sufficiently small positive values of c, the path, vc(<j>), of\nW\"(Pi) tends to -\u00b0\u00b0 as <\u00a3-\u00bb0+ while WSC(PC) leaves (in reverse time) the region\n5? at some point <f>0 situated to the right of Po but sufficiently close to Po. The\nphase portrait of (5) is illustrated in Fig. 2(a).\nWe set M = max [4D'(<f>)g(<{>)], where the maximum is taken on the interval\n[0,1]. The following lemma holds:\nLEMMA 1 For each c > 0 such that c2 5= M there exists a heteroclinic trajectory\nof (5) connecting P, with Po. Moreover, the trajectory WSC(PC) leaves (in reverse\ntime) the region 5? somewhere on the semi-infinite interval - \u00ab > < v < 0 with\n<f> = 1. The phase portrait of (5) is illustrated in Fig. 2(b).\nREMARK 1 Given the equivalence between looking for travelling-wave solutions\nfor (1) satisfying appropriate boundary conditions and looking for heteroclinic\ntrajectories for system (5), the meaning of Proposition 1 and Lemma 1 is as\nfollows: (i) for sufficiently small positive values of c there are no travelling-wave\nsolutions for (1); (ii) for each c>0, such that c2 & M, there exists a monotone\nNONLINEAR DEGENERATE F1SHER-KPP EQUATIONS 215\nFIG. 2.

Let C] and c2 be two arbitrary values of the speed c on IM, with\ncl<c2- Define vCl(<f>) and vC2(<\u00a3) as the path of W*,(PC)) and WSC2(PC2),\nrespectively, whose graphs belong to the region 0?. In a similar way we define\nvCo(<f>) and vM\\(<f>). The following proposition can be proved (see [23]):\nPROPOSITION 2 For co<c-l<c2<M* the following inequalities hold\nfor all 4> e [0, 1].\n< VcH4>) < VcW < V\nREMARK 2 By Proposition 2, if WsCi(PCl) and WsC2(PCl) leave 01 somewhere on\n(0,1), then WSC2(PC2) does so to the right of WsCl(Pc,)- If both leave 0t on\n{(<t>, v):<t> = l,v<0}, then WsC2(PC2) does so below WJ,(PCl).\nNow we proceed to analyse the dynamics given by (5), firstly focusing on the\nexistence of the saddle-saddle heteroclinic trajectory connecting Pt with Pc.\n3. Shooting arguments and the existence of the saddle-saddle connection\nHere we use some shooting arguments to prove the existence of the saddle-saddle\nheteroclinic trajectory of (5) for a suitable value, c* > 0, of the speed c.\nWe begin by constructing the set y = AA' UA'B'UB'B, where A and B are\nthe exit (in reverse time) points of WSC(PC) from Sfc for c = c0 and c = M^,\n216 FAUSTINO SANCHEZ-GARDUNO ET AL.\nB\nFIG. 3. Construction of the region 3).\nrespectively, and the arc A'B' is the boundary of a small circular neighbourhood\nof Pi belonging to the region 3?. The set if will be useful for shooting (see Fig. 3).\nThe following lemma holds.\nLEMMA 2 The stable manifold WC(PC), for c e [c0, M*\\, has a monotone,\ncontinuous intersection with the set AA'B'B.\nFrom Lemma 2 we have the following corollary.\nCOROLLARY 1 There exist values Cj <c 2 such that, for c^<c<c2, WSC(PC)\nintersects the arc A'B' monotonically and continuously (and similarly for the\nsubdue A'B\").\nFor the proof of Lemma 2 we need to address one continuity result and to\nprove a number of preliminary results. The fundamental continuity result we need\ncan be found in many dynamics texts, for example in [22]. This result simply says\nthat, for a hyperbolic equilibrium point, the local stable manifolds not only exist,\nbut they are also continuously dependent on the vector field, in the Cr topology\n(r s= 1). In particular, if the vector field depends smoothly on a parameter (in our\ncase c) then the stable manifold depends smoothly (and hence continuously) on\nthat parameter.\nLet W%]oc(Pc) denote the local stable manifold of Pc. Now define the region Q)\nas the shaded area in Fig. 3.\nThe following proposition holds:\nPROPOSITION 3 3> = DCoXicsiM\\{Wsc(Pc)r\\^i} and, furthermore, for each point\n(<f>, v) e % there is a unique c e [c0, M^] such that (<f>, v) e W*C(PC).\nProof. First note that, since 3) is compact, every local stable manifold W* ioc(Pc)\ncan be extended to a global stable manifold in % denoted by WSC(PC). To\ncomplete the proof we prove the following proposition.\nPROPOSITION 4 For c e [c0, M*], Wse(Pc) intersects AA'B'B transversally.\nProof. We know that the (^-coordinate of each Wsc is monotonically increasing\nNONLINEAR DEGENERATE FISHER-KPP EQUATIONS 217\n(in negative time); that is, the path of W'c can be written as the graph of a\nfunction v = Wsc(<f>). Note that we are slightly abusing the notation, since we\nretain the symbol Wsc to denote the graph and the stable manifold of Pc.\nNow it is clear that the right end-point of such a graph must lie on the line\nAA'B'B. To verify transversality on AA' and on B'B is an easy matter, since\nixQonAA' and #<0 on B'B.\nTo check transversality on the open arc A'B' we use the outward normal\n(<f> - 1, v)T to the arc\nA'B' = {(<\u00a3, v) e %: (<\/> - I)2 + v2 = e2} (e > 0 small).\nWe have\n(<f> - I, v) \u2022 (D(<f>)v, -cv - D'(4>)v2 - gi^Y\n= (0 - l)D\u00ab.)t> + v[-cv - D'(4>)v2 - g(4>)] < 0\nfor (l-e)<4><l, v<0, (<f>,v)eA'B'. Thus the flow, in particular Wsc, is\ntransversal to A'B'. \u2022\nNow we can finish the proof of Proposition 3. For uniqueness, suppose {<$>, v)\nlies both on Wsc and on WSC', for c # c', say c < c'. But we know that W^ < Wsc as\ngraphs, this implies a contradiction. For existence, we need only translate the\ncontinuous dependence of Wsc on c into the continuous dependence of the\nintersection with AA'B'B. To do this, one way is to use what we call Lyapunov\nsurfaces (or complete transverse sections or Poincare sections): First let \/,, =\n{(0, v) G 3): (f> = 17} for 17 > 0 and small (17 to the left of A; see Fig. 4). We can\nprove the following claim.\nFIG. 4. Intersection of W'c and\n2 1 8 FAUST1NO SANCHEZ-GARDUNO ET AL.\nCLAIM Every W*c intersects lv at a unique point. Let vc be the point of\nintersection; that is, vc = Wsc D \/,,. Then vc is a continuous, monotone function of\nc e [co, Mi].\nProof. Every Wsc is transverse to the v-axis (since the eigenspace Esc is\ntransverse). Thus, by openness of transverse intersections, lv is transverse to W%\nContinuous dependence of W5C on c means that the graphs W*c(<f>) depend\ncontinuously on c and so, since vc = Wsc(-q), vc is continuous and is uniquely\ndefined. It is monotone because Wsc-(t)>) < Wsc(4>) for c<c', as we know. D\nWe use the term complete transverse section in 3>, to denote a segment, such as\nlv, transverse to every Wsc, c e [c0, A\/*] (and in particular intersecting all Wsc).\nDefine a 'flow' in 2) as follows: W(yc, t) = 4>C((TJ, VC), t), vc e. lv, t e U, where\n<\u00a3c is the flow\nsuch that,\n(i)\n(ii) <p;(0, -cAD'(O)) = (^(r), w(r)) e W%PC).\nThe map V uses the stable manifold Wsc to propagate the complete transverse\nsection lv. By the compactness of 2), and since every Wsc exits 3) in negative time,\nwe have U W(vc, \/) n @ = 3 , where the union is taken on t e R and on vc e \/,,.\nBut U W{vc, t)r\\2> = Wscn2). Thus we get Proposition 3. D\nTo complete the proof of Lemma 2, we need the following key proposition.\nPROPOSITION 5 AA'B'B is a piecewise smooth complete transverse section.\nProof. We have seen that AA'B'B is transverse to every Wsc and that every W*c\nintersects it. D\nWe now have the correct setting to apply the long-flow-box result to get a map\nfrom \/\u201e to AA'B'B (see [20]). A long flow box is nothing but a concatenation of\nlocal flow boxes.\nLet xc be the intersection of AA'B'B and Wsc Parametrize the curve AA'B'B\nby using some map y: [0, 1]^ AA'B'B so that y(0)=A, y($) = A', y(\\) = B',\nand y(l) = B, where y is a homeomorphism.\nFor xu x2 e AA'B'B, we shall say xt <x2 if *, = y(ti), x2 = y(t2), and ^ <r2.\nThis allows us to talk about monotone intersections.\nIn order to conclude the proof of Lemma 2 we need one final proposition.\nPROPOSITION 6 xc is a continuous, monotone function of c e [c0, A\/*].\nProof. Use, for every vc e lv, a long flow box to map to AA'B'B (a homeo-\nmorphism can always be found between two complete transverse sections).\nNONLINEAR DEGENERATE FISHER-KPP EQUATIONS 219\nFIG. 5. Proof of Proposition 6. See text for details.\nContinuity follows from the continuity of vc and monotonicity similarly follows\n(see Fig. 5). \u2022\nWith this we have proved Lemma 2. \u2022\nNow, let us go back to Corollary 1. By using our parametrization y of AA'B'B,\nwe have a map from [c0, A\/J] to [0,1] which is a homeomorphism and is such that\nc0 is mapped to 0 and A\/J is mapped to 1 (see Fig. 6).\nBy the monotonicity, we thus have values co<Ci <c2<M}> such that [cu c2] is\nmapped 1:1 and onto the closed interval [3, \u00a7], in other words (using y) to A'B'.\nThis proves Corollary 1. D\n4. Uniqueness of the saddle-saddle heteroclinic trajectory\nFinally, to prove that there is a unique value c* e (c0, M) such that Wsc. connects\nPc. to Pu we note that this reduces to the elementary question of the existence\nof a fixed point of a continuous map from an interval to itself: xc establishes a\nhomeomorphism between [cu c2] and [3, \u00a7], xc : [cu c2]\u2014* [3, 3] =A'B'. Now we\nFIG. 6. The map from [c0, M\\] to [0,1].\n2 2 0 FAUSTINO SANCHEZ-GARDUNO ET AL.\nuse the fact that the unstable manifold of Pu for c e [c,, c2], intersects A'B'. Call\nthe point of intersection x'^ This is also monotone, but in the opposite direction.\nThus we have overall a map from the interval [5,3] to itself that is monotone\ndecreasing\nThus there must be a fixed point, that is, a t e [3, \u00a7], such that xc(t) = x'c(t). This is\nbased on the fact that any map of a compact, connected interval into itself has a\nfixed point (this is the simplest version of the classical fixed-point theorem). Since\nour map is monotone, the fixed point is unique.\nWe have thus given an alternative proof to that given in [23] of the uniqueness\nof a value of c, c*, such that WSC.(PC.) connects Px and Pc..\nAssociated with the Pj - Pc. heteroclinic saddle connection, whose existence\nand uniqueness we have just proved, we have the unique travelling-wave solution\nof sharp type for equation (1). This is because the trajectory W\".(P^), of (5),\nleaving the point Pj through the unstable manifold approaches Pc. on the negative\nvertical v-axis as time increases. This means that <\/>(-<\u00bb) = 1, <\/>(T)\u2014* -c*\/D'(0)\nwith V(T) = <\/>(r) < 0, and 0 =s <\u00a3(T) =\u00a3 1, for all T (see Definition 1).\nIf we compare the method carried out here with that given in [23] we see that\nthe method used here involves a more direct dynamical analysis. Hence, the\nmethod developed in this paper to prove the existence and uniqueness of the\nsaddle-saddle trajectory of (5) appears to be sufficiently powerful to be applicable\nin proofs of similar results on heteroclinic connections for other parameter-\ndependent ODE systems, particularly those which come from looking for\ntravelling-wave solutions of parabolic degenerate equations.\nAcknowledgements\nFSG wishes to thank the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT,\nMexico) and the Facultad de Ciencias of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de\nMexico (UNAM) for their support during the time this research was carried out.\nHe also thanks the Centre for Mathematical Biology at Oxford for their\nhospitality.
