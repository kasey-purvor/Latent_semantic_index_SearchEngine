As a formula of governance, it has elaborated various \nvocabularies: the \u2018audit society\u2019 (Power 1997, 2007) has become entrenched in all \ntypes of organisations; surveillance methods (Lyon 2001) have become increasingly \ndispersed and insidious; and \u2013 alongside \u2013 \u2018new\u2019 concepts of subjectivity and the \n\u2018self\u2019 are used to frame more intense regimes of self-discipline or what Tipton (1984) \ncalled \u2018self-work\u2019.  These moves have been captured by Thrift (1997), Heelas (2002) \nand others in the term \u2018soft capitalism\u2019.  In this essay, we reflect upon this \nphenomenon by analysing some examples: \u2018culture\u2019, \u2018performativity\u2019, \u2018knowledge\u2019, \nand \u2018wellness\u2019.  Although they belong to a group often described as \u2018fads\u2019 and \n\u2018fashions\u2019 and dismissed as managerial \u2018mumbo-jumbo\u2019, we suggest that their \nproliferation indicates a more stable cultural tendency of management discourses to \ncapture subjectivity in its general agenda.  We attempt to offer a historical-cultural \ninterpretation from which this range of managerial concepts might be viewed.  Our \nargument suggests that they have a certain cultural coherence that can be perhaps \nbetter glimpsed within a wider historical context.  As a particular way in which \nmanagerialism frames its logic, analysing \u2018soft capitalism\u2019 historically offers a \nreasonable basis for understanding the strength of its hard disciplinary edge as a \nregime of governance. \n \n \n \n \n \nKeywords: management; therapeutic habitus; subjectivity; work; governance; \nmodernity \n \n \n  2 \nContext \n \nTransitions in forms of \u2018government\u2019 or \u2018governance\u2019 can be investigated in a \nvariety of ways.  They depend, among other things, on the unit of analysis upon which \nthe investigation is focussed.  Legitimate units of analysis can be: institutions and \ninstitutional frameworks (states, bureaucracies, corporations, markets, networks, etc.); \ngeopolitical, or spatial scales (global, national, regional, local levels); or technologies \nof governance (such as mass-media, telecommunication, or surveillance systems).  \nIndeed, others are also conceivable: environmental concerns could take precedence \nover other criteria.  The analysis can, however, equally pursue the cultural sensibilities \nof the human subject of governance as a focus for investigation.  The hypothesis \nbehind the latter is that forms and contents of governance processes cannot be fully \nunderstood without grasping the self-understandings that are constitutive of them and \nof their institutional forms.  The sphere of such an investigation is the historical \nconstitution (or genealogy) of matrices of self- and world-understanding which \nground the cultural possibilities of certain discourses of governance.  In this paper, we \npropose to pursue this latter line of analysis.  In order to clarify our speculative \nposition, we need to spell out its confines.  \nHow then do we configure its sphere?  First, managerialism has developed \nover the last two decades an intricate and multifaceted framework which combines \nconcepts and techniques underpinned by several logics that are often contradictory in \ntone and purpose.  Although they are difficult to disentangle, it is useful to group them \nin three major \u2018families\u2019: (a) managerialism has produced a wide-ranging series of \naudit techniques and vocabularies (as Power has extensively shown in 1994, 1997, \n2007); (b) there has been a significant proliferation of surveillance technologies, \nespecially during the 1990s (as exemplified in the work of Lyon 1994, 2001); and (c) \nthere has also been a growth in concepts and techniques which focus upon specifically \nhuman attributes of working subjects such as \u2018culture\u2019, \u2018performativity\u2019, \u2018knowledge\u2019, \nor \u2018wellness\u2019 (discussed, for example, by Anthony 1994; Alvesson 2002a; Alvesson \n2002b; Symon 2005; Willmott 1993).  In this paper, we focus upon this latter \ncategory.   \nSecondly, an important delimitation of this argument relates to the difference \nbetween concepts about the nature of the human subject used in management \nvocabularies, and their practical social effects.  We discuss here the former, namely \nthe area of managerial discourses which aim to establish particular subject positions in \nthe governance of work processes.  These discourses are deployed as a public code \npresenting work as a particular form through which human \u2018selves\u2019 ought to express \ntheir inner potentialities.  However, in concrete social practices and contexts these \ndiscourses create a new kind of political space for their own contestation, disruption, \ntransgression and subversion.  As has been evidenced by numerous empirical studies, \ndiscourses of \u2018cultural management\u2019 are often met with various tactics of deliberate \ntransformation and resistance.  We are not engaging in this paper with such practices \nof resistance and transformation of managerial concepts of subjectivity.  Rather, we \nare investigating the historical and cultural conditions of possibility of their \nappearance within the wider context of modernity as a specific overarching synthesis.  \nThe way we deploy the term \u2018modernity\u2019 in this article should not be construed as a \nmoral, political judgement.  We are not implying in any way that we can find a \nposition outside of this history and weigh its \u2018goodness\u2019 or \u2018badness\u2019.  Rather, we use \nthe category of \u2018modernity\u2019 to guide a historical speculation about the specific \ncharacter of the epoch in which managerialism manifests itself in order to understand \n  3 \nthe concrete discursive forms it is taking.  Moreover, we are not using the notion of \n\u2018modernity\u2019 with totalising ambitions.  In other words, we are not claiming to offer an \nalternative account of the totality of what might be seen as the \u2018modern epoch\u2019 against \nmajor existing histories and analyses (like Marx\u2019s, Weber\u2019s, or Durkheim\u2019s, \nHorkheimer\u2019s and Adorno\u2019s, Heidegger\u2019s or Arendt\u2019s, Habermas\u2019 or Giddens\u2019).  We \ndo not treat the structural aspects of the historical processes underpinning capitalism, \nbut rather the cultural sphere in which certain enduring themes emerge.  The key \ntheme of modernity used in this paper is the centrality of the \u2018self\u2019 as the subject of \npolitical, moral, and cultural discourses. \nFinally, we must clarify the way in which we use the category of \u2018self\u2019.  We \nuse it as a general notion as it appears in concepts such as, for example, \u2018self-\nactualisation\u2019 in the Maslowian vocabulary of motivation, or \u2018self-development\u2019 in \ntechniques such as the \u2018Personal Development Plans\u2019, which imply a particular \nengagement with work.  In other words, we do not deploy the notion of \u2018self\u2019 to \nimpute to concrete persons a static formula of feelings, actions or reactions in work.  \nQuite the contrary, it is important to make clear that agency often destabilises and \ncontests managerial vocabularies that prescribe and confine the sense of personal \nexistence to a disciplinary ethical matrix.  The meanings of managerial concepts are \nunstable and contested in the concrete contexts into which they are inserted. \nHence we focus upon the rise and consolidation, over the last twenty-five \nyears or so, of a persistent set of vocabularies and practices in which the \u2018self\u2019 and \nsubjectivity have become central motifs in the lexicon of management.  Subjectivity is \na fundamental topic in the history of European thought, and for modernity in \nparticular.  However, we cannot develop a satisfactory overview in this paper.  For \ndetailed elaborations, see Carr (1999), Hall (2004), or Strozier (2002).  Over the \nperiod we analyse, themes such as the management of organisational culture, \ncommitment, performativity, knowledge management, and, more recently, wellness at \nwork have become leitmotifs of the managerial repertoire.  We explore some of the \ncultural-historical sources that may account for the consolidation of this trend.  We \nplace this attempt alongside, and not in contradistinction to, other approaches which \npursue different units of analysis (for example, studies of consumer culture such as \nLee\u2019s 1993; Lury\u2019s 1996; or Slater\u2019s 1997, to mention but a few). \nAlthough critical debates about the appropriation of subjectivity by \ncorporations are well-established, a relatively under-examined dimension concerns the  \nhistorical conditions of the increasingly intensive cultural appropriation of subjectivity \nas a modality of ordering relationships at work.  Some of the reasons relate to the fact \nthat, on the one hand, much of what managerialism pretended to offer as novel in the \n1980s could easily be interpreted as a new tactic to cover up management\u2019s attempt to \nundermine the interests of workers by capturing their \u2018souls\u2019 and leaving as little room \nas possible for resistance.  Of course, this appeared to be the case when considering \nthe systematic destruction of trade unions, alongside the systematic construction of a \n\u2018shareholding\u2019 and \u2018home-owning\u2019 middle-class ideal in a newly \u2018democratised \nenterprise culture\u2019.  These structural changes appeared to provide sufficient cause for \nradical shifts in management approaches.  Indeed, they ostensibly continued the \nnormal dynamics of capitalism.  This interpretation characterised the explanations of \nvarious Marxian- and Frankfurt-oriented scholars (especially those informed by \nlabour process analyses).  The dialectical mechanism of historical materialism was \nmobilised to account for the emergence of a new \u2018rhetoric\u2019 of social unity meant to \nhide the usual \u2018reality\u2019 of a divided society, with opposing interests and historical \ndestinies.   \n  4 \nWhat is perhaps more surprising, in hindsight, is that the so-called \u2018post-\nstructuralist\u2019 and \u2018post-modernist\u2019 accounts eventually led in a similar direction.  \nMany interpreters of Foucault, for example, almost literally juxtaposed his \u2018Discipline \nand Punish\u2019 (1977) onto the managerial complex and concluded that the latter \nperforms a similar feat of social control via relatively brutal technologies for re-\nengineering organisational cultures, for panoptic surveillance, and for the \ninternalisation of controls.  Perhaps even less fortunately, many interpreted literally \nFoucault\u2019s famous dismissal of the \u2018Enlightenment subject\u2019 (the frequently \nmisinterpreted \u2018death of the subject\u2019) as a concrete, almost material dissolution of the \nbases upon which the \u2018individual\u2019 may retain some sense of being an independent, \nautonomous, dignified agent, capable of making ethical decisions for itself.  This \nperception of Foucault\u2019s analysis of modern culture was crystallised eventually into \nan account that made the subject a victim of managerial and panoptic manipulation.  \nThis was easily combined with other \u2018post-modernist\u2019 tropes, such as the \u2018collapse of \nmetanarratives\u2019, generating a sense that everything that had been solid had melted \naway into an endless play of simulacra.  \nWhat we offer here is an addition to these critiques.  We re-problematise some \naspects of managerialism from the perspective of cultural history looking at modernity \nas a cultural synthesis with the \u2018self\u2019 at its centre.  We hypothesise that managerialism \nalso expresses, and draws its cultural sustenance from, this historical process.  In other \nwords, a significant segment of contemporary management is made possible by \ncertain sensibilities of the modern conception of \u2018self\u2019 thereby giving shape to a \nrelationship with work which revolves around this concept.  The subject or \u2018the self\u2019 \nto which managerialism refers in some of its discourses is the same \u2018self\u2019 that lies at \nthe centre of modernity.  \nWe develop this speculative position, first, by mapping the rise of certain \nvocabularies of subjectivity in the governance of work in contemporary organisations, \nand, secondly, by providing a historical account of the centrality of a specific \nconception of \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018work\u2019 in modernity as a whole.  In conclusion we will argue \nthat dismissing these trends in management as mere \u2018fads\u2019 and \u2018fashions\u2019 (see, for \nexample, Abrahamson, 1991, Huczynski, 1993, or Prieto, 1993) risks ignoring an \nimportant cultural sign of new processes of governance.  We suggest that taking the \n\u2018self\u2019 as the unit of analysis illuminates further transitional elements in the governance \nof work at the dawn of the 21st century. As a locus of governance, the \u2018self\u2019 shows \nboth cultural continuities within modernity and subtle shifts in the dynamic of its \ncentral themes. \n  We argue that the way in which subjectivity has become entrenched in the \ngovernance of work follows a more complex cultural-historical path with origins in \nthe wider horizon of modernity.  In other words, we cannot simply explain this \nphenomenon as a pure continuation of the permanent dialectic of capitalism, nor as an \nelement of historical novelty with no precedence or antecedence (the \u2018post-modern\u2019).  \nIn addition to these interpretations, our conjecture illustrates how one of the main \ndimensions of modernity (the centrality of the \u2018self\u2019) has elective affinities with the \ngrowing use of managerial vocabularies focussing upon subjectivity.   \n \nSection I.  Vocabularies of subjectivity and the governance of work in \ncontemporary organisations \n \nIn this section we map some of the ways in which subjectivity was \nappropriated in the governance of work since the 1980s.  This phenomenon (known as \n  5 \nthe cultural turn in managerial ideology) has been much debated (e.g. Anthony 1994; \nAlvesson 2002a; Alvesson 2002b; Symon 2005; Willmott 1993).  Reopening it here \naims to spell out more clearly the shift through which human subjectivity became a \nsignificant trope for governing work.  This section offers a working typology of \nspecific moves characterising this cultural turn.  \n The list of such moves has been expanding over the years. Although disparate \nand frequently contradictory, they share a common ground: they are all important \nindicators of one of the paths through which the subject is governed at work.  Their \ngeneral effect is that management has developed, alongside audit and surveillance, a \nnew logic: namely that productivity and profitability, efficiency and effectiveness are \nincreasingly dependent upon a new cultural economy of subjectivity at work.  Put \nsimply, human subjects are exhorted to expand and intensify their contribution as \nselves (as \u2018human resources\u2019) in order to enhance production, maximise value, thus \nleading the organisation to success.  The slogan \u2018people are our most important asset\u2019 \nleft deeper traces than the episodic waxing and waning of one fashion or another.  \nAlthough it is not easy to differentiate them (because they are, indeed, linked by a \ncommon meaning), the following typology aims to show how subjectivity is broken \ndown in multiple aspects, and how it is reassembled around an idealised \u2018better self\u2019 \ncreated by a variety of \u2018therapeutic\u2019 techniques and tactics. \n This brief overview is organised along three dimensions.  The first represents \nthe extension of attributes of subjectivity enlisted in the managerial vocabulary of the \nlast twenty years. The proliferation of concepts associated with the subject at work \ndemands careful consideration.  The second follows the intensification of demands \nplaced upon the subject which has accompanied these new concepts.  This shows how \nnew, more ramified and demanding ways of involvement in work have become part of \nthe managerial vernacular.  Finally, the main effect of this change in managerialism is \nthe transformation of a discourse which functioned initially as an interpretation of the \ncrisis of Western business organisations in the 1980s (due to new and very powerful \ncompetitors, especially Japan) into a prescriptive, normative framework for the \ngovernance of work.  \n \n1. The governance of culture and commitment \n \nChronologically, it appears appropriate to begin with a category generated by the idea \nthat an organisation\u2019s culture is key to competitive advantage.  It was a move made in \nthe name of reconstituting Western corporations as reunified social and political \nentities, centred around an alleged common set of interests.  \u2018Strong cultures\u2019 were \nconceived as the solution for increased quality and productivity.  This notion appeared \nas an appealing response to a period of industrial tension and unrest.  The aim of \nmanaging organisational culture was to recover the managerial prerogative and to \nmarshal organisations around a collective identity.  Associated in this category were \ntropes such as increased participation, employee involvement, empowerment, \nteamwork, self-managed teams, and Quality Circles.  They became favoured \nmanagerial discourses recasting the subject at work as a unified collective political \nbody.  Equally, they provided ways of reshaping organisational forms through \ndownsizing, delayering, or lean organisations.  Their aim was to reconfigure corporate \nidentity around the attributes of an autonomous, \u2018empowered\u2019 subject with a \n\u2018reengineered\u2019 mentality of organisational membership.  The vital ingredient of the \ncollective notion of culture is the governmental concept that continues to frame the \nmanagerial discourse surrounding the relationship between people and organisations: \n  6 \ncommitment.  Commitment became a key discursive currency used to re-enlist \nindividual subjects in a united mode of work.  In more general terms, this first \ncategory groups ideas revolving around a new politics of attachment underpinning the \ngovernance of organisations through the couple \u2018strong culture \u2013 strong commitment\u2019. \n Changing organisational culture was a first step in reconstituting individual \nand corporate identities. Concretely, it meant the elaboration of new programmes \nembodied in mission statements, visions and new value systems facilitated by a \nplethora of consultancy interventions, aimed at reinventing both the identity of the \ncorporation and of the subjects within it.  These interventions consisted in significant \ninvestments of time and money, in endless sequences of training, team-building \nexercises, self-managed teams (configured according to ideal recipes such as \nBelbin\u2019s), or the introduction of cross-functional working.  Their aim was to foster \ninnovation and implement \u2018total quality management\u2019 as the goals of empowerment \nand participation.  \u2018Culture\u2019 was presented as a cure for the rift between organisations \nand employees by flattening hierarchies, widening participation and restructuring \ntraditional frameworks of authoritarian control.  The outcome of efforts to reengineer \norganisational culture opened up new kinds of social spaces that created the \nconditions of possibility for the expansion of therapeutic relationships as mediators \nfor governing work.   \n  \n2. The governance of performance and performativity \n \nThe second category of discourses placing the human subject in a new light was \ngenerated by the subtle shift in the vocabulary of productivity: the emergence of \nperformativity.  In this group we can associate a variety of managerial topics: \u2018total \nquality\u2019, \u2018excellence\u2019, \u2018flexibility\u2019, \u2018performance management\u2019.  These categories \nestablished a fundamental link between increased personal engagement with work and \nthe success of the production process.  The subtle politics of the performance-\nperformativity nexus lie in the message that it is organisations which now rely to a \nlarge extent upon performing subjects, rather than performing subjects upon \norganisations.  The slogans \u2018an organisation is only as good as its human resources\u2019 \nand \u2018people are our greatest asset\u2019 illustrate this rhetorical reallocation of subject \npositions.  The discourse of performativity also accompanied the vast expansion of \nmechanisms of financial audit.  It allowed the translation of subjectivity through a \nmultitude of techniques of accountability such as management by objectives, agreed \ntargets, multi-dimensional appraisals and performance management systems, \n\u2018economic value-added\u2019 measurements, or balanced scorecards (as analysed \nextensively by Froud et al. 2000; Erturk et al. 2004). \nA key practice of performance management in relation to subjectivity is the \nperformance appraisal.  Although it takes many forms, it follows a common course.  \nFirst, the subject of appraisal (\u2018the appraisee\u2019) states his\/her own view of personal \nperformance \u2013 what we might term a confessional stage (following Townley 1994).  \nSecondly, an examination by the line manager (as appraiser) results in a dialogue \nwhose aim is a negotiation identifying areas of improvement as well as developmental \nneeds that might be addressed through various systems of training offered as \n\u2018therapeutic\u2019 techniques both in terms of improving work results and as development \nof the individual.  This process constitutes a context which creates the obligation to \nself-express and self-explore, whilst simultaneously acting as a platform for \ncontinuous monitoring and audit by the organisation.  It allows a move away from \ntraditional forms of monitoring by embroiling the subject in the act of organisational \n  7 \ncontrol, coupled with the therapeutic principle that outcomes must always be agreed \nupon.  This changes the approach to what traditionally was seen as the managerial \nprerogative of control and situates it in a process of double translation.  On the one \nhand, the organisation translates its needs into performance targets, and, on the other, \nthe subject has the opportunity to express its own needs and make the organisation \nresponsible for fulfilling them. This is a new mechanism of governance which makes \nthe employee the focus of a quasi-therapeutic encounter. \n \n3. The governance of knowledge production, creativity and innovation \n \nAs the 1980s and 1990s progressed, another set of concepts was added to the \nvocabulary of managerial governance.  The idea that \u2018knowledge\u2019 was the great \ndifferentiator of performance and a main platform of personal and collective success \nbecame seductive (perhaps even more rapidly than \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018change\u2019 in the early \n1980s).  \u2018Knowledge\u2019 as \u2018the new resource\u2019 was embraced at all levels of government \nand governance.  The \u2018knowledge economy\u2019, the \u2018knowledge-creating company\u2019, \nknowledge management and knowledge workers became important concepts of the \nso-called \u2018new economy\u2019 in which \u2018information\u2019 and \u2018information technologies\u2019 \nappear to carry the promise of endless resourcefulness.  Associated in this category \nare themes such as creativity, innovation, continuous improvement, the learning \norganisation, lifelong learning, Human Resource Development, and talent \nmanagement.  Underpinning them is the expectation that the subject at work should \nalso see itself as participating in a continuous process of knowledge creation.  Thus, \nwork is presented as a space for self-expression opened up by the eagerness of the \norganisation to embrace new ideas, changes and to de-routinise labour (no \norganisation wants to be seen as \u2018mainstream\u2019 anymore).  It also presupposes the \nreadiness of the subject to invest itself in a continuous act of creative thinking, to give \nof itself to work in a new way. \nThis trend further entrenched the link between organisational performance and \nits \u2018human capital\u2019 or \u2018human potential\u2019 (as exemplified by Mayo 2001).  This link \nnow spans societal, institutional and individual levels; it is the central axis of a new \nnarrative of present and especially future success.  Improving knowledge, mobilising \ncreative potential, and being innovative draw new contours for work.  They articulate \na narrative of hope in endless progress unleashed by the potentially infinite power of \nknowledge to overcome various critical points in the lives of individuals and \ncollectivities.  The cultural politics of this category hinge on the \u2018magic\u2019 of mastery \nand expertise through the powers of \u2018Reason\u2019.  A recycled Enlightenment ideal, \n\u2018knowledge\u2019 appears as power in itself, endowing its individual or collective \u2018bearer\u2019 \nwith competitive advantage.  \u2018Knowledge work\u2019 is one of the most emphatic \naffirmations of the resourcefulness of the subject. \nIn practice, knowledge management took various forms.  Dominant was the \nnotion of exploring the hitherto untapped possibilities of \u2018tacit\u2019 knowledge. In the \nname of making it explicit and of \u2018socialising\u2019 or \u2018capturing\u2019 it in visible forms, \norganisations reprocessed many of the practices of culture management: \nbrainstorming, \u2018thinking outside the box\u2019, multi-disciplinary project teams, and \n\u2018communities of practice\u2019 (e.g. Brown and Duguid 1991; Nonaka 1995; Wenger \n1999).  The intention was to create new kinds of interaction supposed to mobilise and \nintegrate individual and collective tacit knowledge in increasingly visible and \nmanageable ways.  The characteristic of these new spaces for the socialisation of \nknowledge was the expectation that subjects are willing to articulate their previously \n  8 \nhidden domain of ideas and skills.  The hope was that skill and craft locked in brains \nand bodies become communicable in codes and systematic knowledge.  Associated \nwas the belief that computational technology could capture fleeting but valuable \ninsights in some form of permanent repository.  Paradoxically, the creative and \ninnovative were to become routinised. This created a new position in which the \nsubject is both master and owner of this new fundamental resource, and at the same \ntime the target of ceaseless exhortations to release it into the public organisational \narena.  New forms of confessing one\u2019s thoughts, in the name of actively sharing \npersonal and collective knowledge, became central to interactive database systems as \nnew forms of socialisation.  \n \n4. The governance of wellness, happiness and self-actualisation \n \nA more recent category of subject attributes which have become legitimate \nmanagerial territory consists of a multitude of ways of addressing the subject in its \ntotality as an object of governance.  They are captured under a variety of names: \nemotional intelligence (measured by \u2018Emotional Quotients), organisational spirituality \nand spiritual intelligence (measured by \u2018Spiritual Quotients\u2019), the \u2018work-life balance\u2019, \nself-realisation and self-actualisation, programmes for health at work, \u2018wellness at \nwork\u2019, and \u2018happiness at work\u2019.  Moreover many organisations now use the trope of \n\u2018fun\u2019 to present what it might mean to work for them. Some increasingly see their \ncultures in terms of a combination of work and play.  Thus, the entire meaning of \nhuman life becomes in varied guises the preoccupation of management, which \npresupposes the cultural legitimacy of blurred boundaries between working life and \nlife outside work.  This category marshals no more and no less than an imagery of \ntotal well-being at work, invoking it as an opportunity for personal completeness, for \na harmonious and full life.  The value of exchanging labour as an employee is thrust \ninto a cultural sphere with entirely new dimensions.  The idea that one's employer \nprovides some sort of totalised care for the worker\u2019s wellness opens up a powerful \nhorizon for expanding the boundaries of organised work.   \nIn practice, the wellness agenda is being formulated through the appropriation \nand conversion of more traditional discourses concerning absenteeism, cost-reduction \nrelated to health and safety, incapacity benefits, stress and mental health costs.  This \nhas led to the formation of new concepts that attach themselves to these discourses \nmultiplying their forms, expanding and intensifying the areas in which subjectivity \nbecomes an object for political-governmental intervention at multiple levels.  For \nexample, in the case of the UK, both the government and the Chartered Institute of \nPersonnel and Development (CIPD, the professional body for those involved in HR) \nspell out this managerial expansion (e.g. CIPD\u2019s Change Agenda on \u2018What\u2019s \nHappening to Well-being at Work?\u2019 2007a).  In their most recent document dedicated \nto this topic, CIPD states that: \n \n\u201cWell-being initiatives include: Almost half of organisations provide all \nemployees with access to counselling services as part of their well-being \ninitiative. This is followed by employee assistance programmes (31%) and \n\u2018stop smoking\u2019 support (31%). Around quarter of employers also provide \nhealth screening, healthy canteen options and subsidised gym membership to \nall employees.\u201d (CIPD 2007b) \n \n  9 \nA key ingredient of such wellness programmes are various counselling and \ntherapeutic services which have a common denominator: they project work as a \nsphere where all aspects of the self belong to, and are taken care of.  The entire gamut \nof subjectivity is incorporated by these discourses in the governance of work.  They \noften present employment as if it were a complete package catering for the well-being \nof the whole person. \nFinally, we want to single out one of the key episodes of the invocation of the \nsubject in managerial discourse: the rise of Human Resource Management as the new \ngeneral umbrella of \u2018people management\u2019.  Although HRM shares the features of the \nmanagerial tropes categorised above, it also has distinct characteristics.  This loose, \ncomplex phenomenon is perhaps the most important exemplar of the trend to \nappropriate subjectivity as a whole in the managerial agenda.  The reason is that HRM \nhas managed to expand its language and logic to include in one way or another all the \ncategories discussed above.  In doing so, it has become consolidated in its own right, \nmore than any others, as a durable framework for governing people at work.  It is a \nlegitimate part of organisational structures, it developed its own departments, it \nbecame an academic discipline in its own right, it elaborated its professional canon \n(through organisations such as the CIPD), and led to the emergence of a significant \nconsultancy sector.  HRM has gradually expanded its range to incorporate many of \nthe ideas and practices mentioned above.  It has brought them together and dispersed \nthem throughout the managerial idiom.  The ideological and technical apparatus of \nHRM performs nowadays the function of legitimating the utilisation of subjectivity as \nthe key resource for productivity and competitiveness.  Moreover, the discourses of \nHRM imply that it does not simply serve the strategic purpose of organisations, but \nthat it also serves the strategic purpose of a meaningful working life for the members \nof organisations. \nTo conclude this section and lead into the interpretation that follows, we want \nto specify more clearly our hypothesis: the consolidation of these vocabularies and \npractices of governing work through subjectivity is grounded in the deep-seated sense \nof \u2018self\u2019 which lies at the core of modernity writ large.  What unites the concrete \npractices discussed above into a coherent cultural nexus draws its sustenance from the \nunderlying logic that characterises the specific cultural self-understanding of the \nmodern subject.  In the next section, we will elaborate this link. \n \nSection II. The subject of managerialism: the \u2018therapeutic habitus\u2019 and the \nmodern sense of self \n \nTo posit the cultural coherence of these practices does not imply in any way, at \nleast in our understanding, that they emerged somehow as a \u2018whole\u2019 at once. Nor do \nwe imply that they were formed as a quasi pre-planned, self-conscious ensemble \nwhich was rolled out wholesale.  The various attributes of subjectivity which have \ncome to be included in the managerial agenda are often divergent and not necessarily \nconsistent in each and every combination.  Most of the time, they are not all employed \nsimultaneously in any one organisation.  Moreover, the piecemeal manner in which \nthese ideas emerged does not allow for an account of their history as an intentional, \ncalculated or purely cynical managerial ploy.  Despite the fact that they appear in an \nunsystematic fashion, subjectivity \u2013 as the common theme that underlies them all \u2013 \nbecomes their intelligible and coherent nucleus requiring further analysis. \nOne way to capture the common logic of these new forms of work governance \nis the (inspired) metaphor of \u2018soft capitalism\u2019 used by Thrift (1997), Ray and Sayer \n  10 \n(1999), and Heelas (2002).  Ray and Sayer (1999, p.17) emphasized that the logic of \norganisational success has become gradually bound up with the ever more intense \nemployment of \u2018soft\u2019 characteristics of the labouring subject.  However, the predicate \n\u2018soft\u2019 must not be confused with the implication that contemporary work has become \neasy.  Rather, as the authors above point out, \u2018soft\u2019 denotes the expansion and \nintensification of demands on the self to become ever more involved in work with its \nwhole subjectivity.  Indeed, once the subject is placed at the centre of work \ngovernance with the entire range of its attributes, labour becomes \u2018hard\u2019 in a new \nway.  The specific \u2018hardship\u2019 of labour which lies at the centre of soft capitalism is \ngrounded in a new type of ethical vector.  Tipton (1984) called this new ethics the \n\u2018ethics of self-work\u2019.  As Heelas (2002, p.80) explains, this new form of work ethics \nchanges \u201cthe locus of authority-cum-value\u201d by situating it in \u201canother kind of \nindividualisation\u201d. This individualisation refers to: \n \n\u201cthe self as a self which considers itself to be something more, something \nmuch \u2018deeper\u2019, more natural and authentic than the self of what is taken to be \ninvolved with the superficialities of the \u2018merely\u2019 materialistic-cum-\nconsumeristic; the self as a self which has to work on itself to enrich and \nexplore itself in the process of dealing with its problems\u201d (idem.) \n \nThis ethic changes both the position of work in the life of the subject and the \nrelationship of the subject with work as a social activity.  Work becomes another stage \nfor self-expression alongside the spheres of consumption and leisure. The historical \nhorizon of this transformation lies not only in the last two decades, but in the whole of \nthe twentieth century which made the concrete modality of self-work increasingly \nvisible.  We refer here to the consolidation and expansion of various therapeutic \ntechniques and mentalities that now straddle both the sphere of production and \nconsumption in a multiple array of self-help practices (Lasch 1979; Miller and \nMcHoul 1998).  The apparatus of soft capitalism acquires its immediate, everyday \nconcreteness through what we term the therapeutic habitus.  Managerialism, in the \nlatter part of the last century, uses (alongside audit and surveillance) elements of the \nculture of the therapeutic as new modalities of governing work.  The managerial \ntactics explored in the previous section mobilise the ethics of self-work in the sphere \nof organisations. They bring the therapeutic into the domain of labour.  This can be \nseen, for instance, in the mechanism through which production and productivity are \ntransformed into acts of \u2018performance\u2019 and \u2018performativity\u2019.  Equally illustrative is \nthe new combination of the work effort with the tropes of wellness and well-being.  \nWhat is novel about the intensive and extensive appropriation of subjectivity \nby managerialism from the 1980s onwards is that the logic of work is presented also \nas a process of releasing the full potentialities of the self, as a locus in which self-\nexploration and expression are encouraged, as a place where traditional restrictive \ncontrols recede into the background.  \u2018Fordist\u2019 management (which presupposes the \nrepression of subjectivity in its self-expressive mode and its submission to a variety of \nexternally imposed controls) is replaced by a new discourse of engagement in which \nself-expression is encouraged while control is situated in processes of self-\nexamination, evaluation and reflection. In other words, the site of control is also \ndisplaced to a significant extent from external to inner attributes of the subject who is \nurged to self-manage.  This marks a subtle twist in the cultural dynamic of managerial \ncontrol: encouraging autonomous employees to use their alleged independence to \n  11 \nexpress their resourcefulness as well as to submit themselves to continuous self-\nscrutiny and audit in the name of accountability.  \nAs Rose (1998, p.192) argues: \n \n\u201c[The] therapeutic [appears], rather, in the sense that the relation to oneself is \nitself folded in therapeutic terms \u2013 problematising oneself according to the \nvalues of normality and pathology, diagnosing one\u2019s pleasures and \nmisfortunes in psy terms, seeking to rectify or improve one\u2019s quotidian \nexistence through intervening upon an \u2018inner world\u2019 we have enfolded as both \nso fundamental to our existence as humans and yet so close to the surface of \nour experience of the everyday.\u201d \n \nSeeing the therapeutic in this way, we can also grasp some of the important \nchanges in the systematic governance of subjectivity in everyday work.  Using \nmultiple tactics to present work as a sequence of opportunities for self-expression, \nmanagerialism transforms self-expression into a predicate of organisational and self-\ndiscipline, without needing to make recourse to traditional authoritarian vocabularies \nof control leaving room for the expansion of \u2018positive\u2019, \u2018developmental\u2019 technologies \nof audit.  As Power (2007, p.16) argues: \u201cThis is the real audit society.  It is not an \nadversarial world of external inspectors \u2013 although that can still happen. It is the \nnormalised auditable world of self-inspection.\u201d  Power draws attention here to the \nways in which audit is hidden in the vocabularies and techniques of the \u2018therapeutic\u2019. \nComprehensive appraisal and performance management systems are \nmanifestations of how the therapeutic is enlisted in the audit process itself.  They \nposition \u2018manager\u2019 and \u2018managed\u2019 in a therapeutic context in which the former acts as \nquasi-therapist filling in a \u2018case history\u2019 and decides, together with the latter as \n\u2018patient\u2019, a course of future treatment (through the rubric of the \u2018Personal \nDevelopment Plan\u2019 for example).  Indeed, the manager is not exempt from her\/his \nown appraisal: 360\u00b0 Degree Appraisals expose everybody to comprehensive scrutiny.   \nA crucial feature of the therapeutic habitus embodied in the cultural turn is that \nits discourses and techniques claim that they do not discriminate between hierarchical \nlevels.  Indeed, the entire organisational body undergoes many of these treatments.  \nFurthermore, the more intense and more expensive the technique (especially those \ninvolving external consultants), the more likely it is that its subjects will be the \nmanagerial cadre (executives) rather than shopfloor ranks.  The therapeutic disperses \nitself throughout organisations just as it has throughout the wider culture both in acts \nof production and consumption.  To the extent that everybody is a \u2018self\u2019 in this sense, \neverybody may be subjected to such practices. \nCollectively, culture management has become the envelope within which \ncommitment therapies are performed. Culture functions as the mechanism through \nwhich every organisational member commits to the symbolic order of the community.  \nReintegrating the subject into the communal symbolic system presents managed \norganisational cultures as forms of community cure in themselves.  Culture draws the \nboundaries which establish the corporate identity within which individuals are to \norganise the range of their own experiences.  \n The power of the therapeutic context lies in this complex cultural positioning \nof the individual and collective subject.  As the \u2018self\u2019 is placed at the centre of the \ntherapeutic relationship, it is more easily captured by practices of self-improvement, \nself-development, or HRD, by practices of appraisal, teamwork, self-management, or \nin assessment.  The therapeutic relationship brings the self close to itself, it creates a \n  12 \nspace in which it (the self) is the focus.  It professes to allow for individual \ndifferentiation and for the establishment of a personal contract between employee and \nemployer.  This context also portrays the self as an always insufficiently utilised \nresource, a resource whose full potential risks remaining concealed unless it is helped \nto surface through the mediation of experts.  The subject thus must take the \nopportunity to make itself available and visible to expert scrutiny in the name of \nimproving itself, of accessing its purportedly limitless powers, as a path to self-\nrealisation.   \n The therapeutic relationship thus appeals to the ethic of self-work through a \npromise of improvement, of discovery of a \u2018better self\u2019, or of a better way of being \noneself.  An example which makes this logic clearly visible are the recent attempts to \ninclude \u2018wellness\u2019 and \u2018happiness\u2019 as elements of the cultural contract of work.  \nProgrammes of \u2018wellness at work\u2019 aim to transform the space and modalities of \ngoverning by repositioning the subject in relation to itself and work.  The invocation \nof a metaphor of a nearly clinical nature opens up a new avenue for profiling the \nrelationship between one\u2019s work life and the rest of personal existence.  The promise \nof finding unknown potentialities in oneself marks the therapeutic context as a critical \ningredient in the creation of a new subject position: namely, that work provides the \nopportunity to enhance personal value, to realise previously latent capabilities in the \nservice of self-affirmation and self-realisation.  As Bellah et al. (1985, p.123) argued, \n\u201cmuch of our work is a form of therapy.\u201d   \nThe positioning of work as a subject-centred therapeutic process of continuous \ndevelopment makes possible new forms of self-governance.  As the predicates of \nsubjectivity are used to formulate positive, constructive ideals which link \norganisational success with personal achievement through self-expression, the \ninclusion of the therapeutic in managerial idioms becomes a new kind of disciplinary \nmatrix rooted in the therapeutic habitus of the modern self.   \n \nThe notion of habitus and the self \n \nIn this context, we must introduce, albeit very briefly, the notion of \u2018habitus\u2019.   \nWe propose this notion here not as a conceptual advancement, but merely as a \nfootnote to the literatures on both the \u2018therapeutic\u2019 (Rieff 1966; Foucault 1967; Rose \n1999; Patocka 2002; Furedi 2004) and \u2018habitus\u2019 (from Aristotle\u2019s hexis and Aquinas\u2019s \nhabitus, to elaborations in Schiller and Kierkegaard, as well as Mauss 1973 and \nBourdieu 1977).  In its long history, the category of \u2018habitus\u2019 has been developed in \ntwo main senses.  Until its twentieth century uses in sociology, its main philosophical \nreference was to the ethical horizon or tradition in which the \u2018soul\u2019 was to search for a \npath to virtue and self-perfection (especially developed in Aquinas 1976).  In \nsociology, its accent shifted radically to the body and to the relationships between \nembodiment and sociality.  Mauss (1973, p.73) consigns it specifically to the body in \nits present and aims explicitly to remove any of its former references to the \u2018soul\u2019.  In \nBourdieu (1977, p.78-87), habitus refers more to those behaviours which are derived \nalmost unintentionally from objective structures in which the subject finds itself in a \nparticular \u2018present\u2019.  Habitus becomes a matter of what he calls \u201cintentionless intent\u201d \n(1977, p.79), it is the outcome precisely of the fact that \u201csubjects do not, strictly \nspeaking, know what they are doing\u201d (idem). \nIn this paper, we use the term habitus in its traditional sense, the one which it \nhas acquired in Thomas Aquinas\u2019 Summa Theologiae (IaeIIae q. 22-48; 49-54): \n\u2018habitus\u2019 is the way in which (as far as possible) human nature acquires perfection \n  13 \nthrough the intentional mediation of the practical relationships between \u2018passions\u2019 \n(desires or sensibilities, as Tocqueville put it, \u2018habits of the heart\u2019) and \u2018reason\u2019 so \nthat every human act becomes \u2018virtuous\u2019 in some way.  The use of habitus here is \nmetaphorical; it aims to capture the underlying character of the mentality of self-\nperfection invoked by managerialism, a mentality best represented by Rieff\u2019s image \nof the therapeutic\u2019s \u2018triumph\u2019 (1966).  The reference to Aquinas associates it more \ndirectly to the sphere of what might be termed the \u2018modern soul\u2019.  The therapeutic \nhabitus, in our sense, is not to be read in the Maussian key as a routine, or \u2018technique\u2019, \nof the body, but as a mode of projection in which specific orientations towards the \nfuture, specific \u2018horizons of expectation\u2019 (Koselleck 2002) manifest themselves \n\u2018habitually\u2019 and not simply routinely.  Thus \u2018habitus\u2019 indicates here the complex \ndiscursive horizon through which the \u2018self\u2019 is exhorted to project its potentialities not \nmerely in the static manner of routines of self-maintenance, but as a dynamic through \nwhich the subject ought to continuously work upon itself to become a better \u2018human \nresource\u2019. \nAt this point emerges the critical historical link between the culture of \u2018virtue\u2019 \nand that of the \u2018therapeutic\u2019 in the European tradition: virtue comes out, ever since the \nancient Greeks, from the proper examination and \u2018care of the soul\u2019 (Patocka 2002, \np.91-92).  In Christianity, self-exploration in prayer and confession are the specific \npractical modalities through which the individual does therapeia as the act of \u2018doing \nservice to the gods\u2019 (Liddell 1966).  Indeed, the relationship between a proper \n\u2018habitus\u2019 and the continuous self-examination and care for the soul can be seen as an \nuninterrupted feature in European cultural history (from Plato, to Plotinus, Augustine, \nAquinas, Duns Scottus, William of Ockham, de Montaigne, or Descartes).   \nAlthough Aquinas\u2019 conception is, of course, based upon a given theological \ninterpretation, taking a leap forward to the latter part of the twentieth century, the \nsecularisation of late modernity makes the human \u2018self\u2019 in its ordinary, everyday life, \nthe ultimate underlying principle (subject) of world order (Taylor 1989), whose \ncontinuous preoccupation with itself becomes the basis of what Foucault (2005) called \nthe \u2018care of the self\u2019 as an individuated and self-referential entity.  The modern \u2018self\u2019 \nbecomes the locus and object of the \u2018therapeutic habitus\u2019 in its twentieth century \nsense.   \nContemporary managerialism aims to establish a normative framework by \nmobilising this \u2018therapeutic habitus\u2019 in the forms discussed previously.  Certain \nsegments of managerial discourses about work are predicated upon the premise that it \nhas become a place of release from the renunciatory ethos of self-abnegation \n(especially in the Christian tradition that informed Aquinas, Luther or Calvin).  \nManagement\u2019s invocation of the self and subjectivity (as objects to be cultivated, \ndeveloped, and enhanced by releasing their full \u2018human resourcefulness\u2019) portrays \nwork as an order of therapy sui generis. The claim that underpins the cultural logic of \nthe nexus of practices described in the previous section is based upon the arsenal of \nthe therapeutic as one manifestation of the wider logic of modern culture, whose main \naim is the liberation and emancipation of the \u2018Self\u2019.  \n \nModernity and the centrality of the \u2018self\u2019 \n \nIn this last part of the argument we explore further the hypothesis that \nmanagement\u2019s \u2018turn to the self\u2019 is a significant cultural phenomenon because it is \nrooted in one of the fundamental features of modernity: the centrality of the self and \nof self-assertion.  The modern \u2018Self\u2019 provides a historical-cultural link between \n  14 \nmanagerialism in some of its latest incarnations and modernity as a cultural epoch and \nsynthesis. The historical horizon which opens up is thus broader than that of the last \ntwenty-five years.  We suggest that managerialism has appropriated a diverse but \ninterconnected set of fundamental modern questions regarding the sense of self and \nwork, of order and meaning.   \nWhat do we mean by \u2018modernity\u2019?  \u2018Modernity\u2019, in this context, \u201cis a \nhistorical-cultural \u2018event\u2019 which changes the relationship between the universe, its \ntranscendent horizon, and its human interpreter\u201d (Dupr\u00e9 1993, p.249).  This happens \nbecause it formulates a new ontotheological synthesis (Dupr\u00e9 1993, p.249 ff.) whose \nunderlying principle (hypokeimenon or subjectum) becomes the human subject itself.  \nHypokeimenon, or subjectum (etymologically, \u2018that which lies beneath\u2019) means, in \nphilosophical terms, the elementary level of being.  This is reoccupied in modernity \nby what we call the human \u2018subject\u2019 or \u2018self\u2019 as the primordial source of meaning and \nvalue (a position previously occupied by gods, ideas, nature, or substance (ousia)).  \nPerhaps it is possible to see some of the links between the growth of certain \nmanagerial discourses in recent forms and the centrality of the \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018self-\nprogress\u2019.  The dispersion of managerialism throughout contemporary culture appears, \nin this light, as one of the expressions of the general logic of modernity.   \nIn modernity, a crucial transformation takes place in relation to work as the \nway in which the modern self interprets its existence.  Labour (work) becomes the \nrealm in which humans express their true humanity (Hegel 1986, Marx 1975, Weber \n1958, Bergson 1960, Arendt 1958, L\u00f6with 1965).  It is precisely because of this \ntransformation of the labouring activity as an \u2018expression of life\u2019 (among others) that \nmodernity distinguishes itself from previous historical epochs.  In Greek Antiquity, \nfor example, such an interpretation was literally inconceivable. It was the \ndetermination of \u2018man\u2019 as the animal rationale that prohibited the Greeks from \nconceiving labour as an expression of life.  For them, to be a human meant exactly the \nopposite; it meant freedom from the necessity of labour, liberation from its derogatory \nand animal nature in order to create the space for the exercise of reason within the \npolis.  Thus, slavery was seen as necessary since it protected humanity against any \nsubjection to necessity, against any attempt to infringe on the claim to be human.  As \nArendt (1958, p.83-84) shows, \n \n\u201cTo labour meant to be enslaved by necessity, and this enslavement was \ninherent in the conditions of human life. Because men were dominated by the \nnecessities of life, they could win their freedom only through the domination \nof those whom they subjected to necessity by force.\u201d \n \nThe precise opposite characterises modernity.  Labour is no longer an activity \nthat occupies a derogatory position in the axiomatic scheme of humanity and nature. \nRather, it becomes the \u2018expression of life\u2019 itself, a process which gathers its specific \nmomentum with the rise of secularised industrial societies in the nineteenth and \ntwentieth centuries and which finds its latest expression in the ethics of self-work and \nthe centrality of contemporary work organisations. This process is synthesised in \nmodern political economy and acquires a new metaphysical coherency and dynamism \nwith the thought of Karl Marx (1975).  Marx remained himself a key exponent of the \nidea that labour expresses true humanitas (on that basis, this idea developed into one \nof the most important parts of his system, the theory of alienation).  Furthermore, Max \nWeber (1958) showed the links between the Protestant Ethic and the centrality of \nwork for the Christian vocation and the emergence of capitalism. \n  15 \nThe modern cultural synthesis has as one of its fundamental dimensions the \nfact that labouring activity, work as such, becomes the constituting factor of human \nexistence.  This occurred because the profound disintegration of the pre-modern sense \nof world order dissolved the certainties by which the world appeared as a pre-ordered, \nsupreme \u2018cosmos\u2019, governed by an omnipotent \u2018Creator\u2019 and guardian, in which the \nhuman occupied a rather passive, contemplative, predetermined place.  As a \nconsequence of the dissolution of the geocentric worldview of early Christianity, the \nworld becomes an \u2018infinite universe\u2019 (Koyr\u00e9, 1968), a place where humanity is now \nalone and where survival can only come from an active engagement with life itself \n(Arendt 1958; Blumenberg 1985).  The modern \u2018self\u2019 emerges as the sole point of \nreference of the new synthesis, faced with the only alternative for survival: self-\nassertion through labour.  Nature itself becomes a store of resources for the \nproduction of the species\u2019 concrete, everyday existence.  Thus, despite the loss of \nprevious certainties in an \u2018enchanted world\u2019 (in Weber\u2019s terms 1958), the threshold of \nmodernity sees the transformation of \u2018man\u2019 into an individualised self, an \nautonomous, assertive subject, with an unprecedented freedom and a horizon of \nendless potentialities.  The \u2018self\u2019 as subject became a cultural reality; this is the birth \nof Descartes\u2019 ego.  Though seemingly enabled by this cultural liberation from the \nshackles of Medieval dogmatism, the individual ego stands alone in the infinite \nuniverse.  It has to labour (materially and ideatically) to construct its everyday \nexistence without recourse to the traditional reference points (divinity and ordered \ncreation) \u2013 what Arendt called vita activa (1958).  Human life becomes a project, the \nrealisation of which presupposes that the human subject becomes self-expressive as \nwell as self-making (in other words, seeking continuously to give its life meaning).  \nAs Dupr\u00e9 (1993, p.119) argues: \n \n\u201cIn the course of assuming control over everything else the self, as \nKierkegaard put it, lost sight of its own identity.  Separated from that totality \nwhich once nurtured it and largely deprived of the interiority which once \ndefined it, it has become an indigent self.\u201d \n \nNietzsche (1983) called this phenomenon \u201cmodern man\u2019s small soul\u201d.  \nSeeking to fill the meaning-vacuum at its centre, the modern self generates its own \nsubstance through practices of self-work and the therapeutic culture which purports to \noffer endless possibilities.   \nThe \u2018self\u2019 becomes, in modernity, the central subject of its own order.  It was \nhenceforth converted into the locus of a new system of political ordering and \ngovernance.  What followed was the designation of new \u2018places\u2019 (topoi) where \u2018true \nhumanity\u2019 manifests itself.  A new kind of sociality was constituted, new institutions \nemerged, and a new purpose of governance ensued.  This happened because, \nevidently, previous institutions (such as the polis of the Greeks, the civitas of the \nRomans, the ecclesia of the Christians) could no longer provide a meaningful and \narticulate framework for governing human self-expression.  The site for self-\nexpression crystallised partly around labour itself and the work-organisation with the \nsubject at its centre, and also around the celebration of consumption and leisure.   \nContemporary work organisations and the highly urbanised spaces which \nresulted from the concentration of labour represent this reality.  Governing the social \nrelations of human productive activity is now one of the poles of political discourse, \npractice, and institutions.   \n \n  16 \nConcluding remarks \n \nSeveral major trends characterise contemporary managerialism: the expansion \nof audit technologies at all levels of governance, the intensification of surveillance \nespecially through increasingly sophisticated information technologies, and the \ngrowth of vocabularies that attempt to enrol subjectivity (in various guises) as an \nessential ingredient of organisational performance.   \nIn this paper, we offered a historical-cultural commentary upon some of the \ndiscursive changes accompanying this last category.  We have grouped these changes \naround \u2018culture\u2019, \u2018performativity\u2019, \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018wellness at work\u2019.  We argued \nthat these are not a superficial, temporary and irrelevant accumulation of managerial \nmumbo-jumbo (Wheen 2004, Watson 2004).  Rather, the aim of this speculative \nexercise is to draw attention to the wider historical-cultural horizon in which the roots \nof these subject-centred managerial concepts may lie.  The adoption of such concepts \nfor the mediation of relationships at work has led to the emergence of new cultural \nboundaries in which governance has become a more demanding process calling the \n\u2018self\u2019 increasingly into question.  What characterises the restructuring of techniques of \nmanagement as a consequence of this \u2018turn to the self\u2019 is the mobilisation of what we \ntermed \u2018therapeutic habitus\u2019 as one of the features of \u2018soft capitalism\u2019 and its ethic of \nself-work.  The reason for this analysis is to draw attention to how managerialism \nexpands its range of tropes and sites to include a broader spectrum of the modern \nidentity at work in the pursuit of economic rationality.  Therefore, we suggest that \npossible transitions in contemporary forms of governance need to take into account, \namongst other avenues of analysis, this expansion of management in the sphere of the \nmodern \u2018self\u2019.   \nThe notion of \u2018therapeutic habitus\u2019 has been used to refer to the wider \nhistorical horizon which makes possible the expansion and intensification of these \nmanagement approaches.  They can be thus linked to a \u2018long revolution\u2019 (in Raymond \nWilliams\u2019 terms) in the constitution of the modern sense of \u2018self\u2019.  Modernity is \nimportant in this context because, as a cultural-historical epoch, it is characterised by \na specific matrix of self- and world-understanding in which the \u2018self\u2019 has become the \ncentral referential axis.  As the process of secularisation of the modern world \ninexorably unfolded, it was accompanied by a re-centring of cosmic order around the \n\u2018self\u2019.  It is in this context that the colonisation of the modern sense of \u2018self\u2019 by \nmanagerialism is a significant phenomenon which cannot be easily dismissed.  In this \nhorizon we make the case that subjectivity has become an important site and object of \ngovernance.  Its specific sensibilities, mentalities and ethos must be analysed in \nparallel with other investigations of institutional forms that have traditionally \ninformed our understanding of government and governance.  The managerial concepts \nexamined here require the attention of scholars because they project new horizons in \nwhich work is conceptualised and the identity of the labouring subject is colonised. \n This essay has of course its obvious limitations.  It is based on a general type \nof historical speculation.  We have not covered here well-known empirical work \nwhich shows how the application of these techniques generates their own contestation \nin practice.  There are well-documented instances which show how people resist, \nundermine, transgress or transform them through their engagement such practices.  \nThis is a very important aspect of governance and it is in these processes of \ncontestation that the future of such managerial discourses lies.  Our analysis focussed \non pointing out some of the conditions of possibility for the rise of this specific aspect \nof managerial discourse in the last part of the twentieth century and the early twenty-\n  17 \nfirst.  It would be foolhardy to even attempt to predict what the future of governance \nwill bring.  The therapeutic culture of the \u2018self\u2019 may or may not continue to be one of \nthe central resources of future governance (especially at work).  However, it may still \nrequire analysts\u2019 attention in the future as much as other units of analysis.   \nGiven the centrality of the \u2018self\u2019 in modernity, the process by which the \u2018self\u2019 \nand subjectivity are appropriated as key ingredients of ordering society, economy and \npolity should not be treated dismissively or superficially.  In this sense the fragments \nof practices and discourses discussed here are relevant indicators of this process.  Our \nattempt is to provide a basis for debate and not to resolve, or close dogmatically, the \nquestions we raise.  On this basis, we propose it as a contribution to the wider \ndiscussions on the nature and place of managerialism in contemporary society and \nculture. \n \nReferences \n \nAbrahamson, E.
