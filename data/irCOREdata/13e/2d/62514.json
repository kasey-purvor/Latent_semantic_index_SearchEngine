INTRODUCTION\nColonial breeding in birds is defined as a \u2018form of\ngroup living in which individuals breed within densely\ndistributed nesting territories that contain no resources\nother than nesting sites\u2019 (Perrins & Birkhead 1983).\nInteractions with conspecifics in colonies are widely\nviewed as accruing net fitness benefits, for example,\nthrough enhanced protection from predators (Lack\n1968; Birkhead 1977) or social transfer of foraging\ninformation (Clode 1993), outweighing costs such as\nextra-pair copulations or intraspecific aggressionElectronic supplementary material is available at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/\n10.1098\/rsbl.2008.0417 or via http:\/\/journals.royalsociety.org.\nReceived 25 July 2008\nAccepted 22 August 2008(Anderson et al. 2004). Much of our understanding of\navian coloniality is derived from seabirds, where 98 per\ncent of species are colonial (Lack 1968), and empirical\ndata testing hypotheses concerning coloniality have\nbeen collected mainly under favourable breeding con-\nditions. Recent poor breeding success at many seabird\ncolonies in the UK (Mavor et al. 2005) provides a\nnovel opportunity to investigate whether environmental\nconditions are important in mediating the social\nfunctioning of breeding colonies.\nMany seabirds have bi-parental care and, particu-\nlarly in cliff and ground-nesting species, one parent\ntypically remains with the offspring to provide protec-\ntion from predators and adverse weather while the\nmate is away foraging (Burger & Piatt 1990). The time\nparents spend together at the nest site during favour-\nable conditions can be re-allocated to foraging effort\nwhen conditions deteriorate, buffering food delivery\nagainst adverse conditions (Burger & Piatt 1990). In\nextreme circumstances, parents may need to forage\nsimultaneously, leaving their chick unattended: such\nchicks may gain protection within colonies from the\nproximity of neighbouring birds, providing a further\nbuffer against adverse foraging conditions. However,\nthey may also be at risk from conspecifics such as non-\nbreeders attempting to usurp nest sites (Anderson\net al. 2004; Hamer et al. 2007).\nCommon guillemots Uria aalge (hereafter guille-\nmots) are highly colonial cliff-nesting seabirds.\nSuccessful breeding requires behavioural coordination\nboth within and between pairs (Birkhead 1977) and\naggression among adults is common (Birkhead 1978;\nLewis et al. 2007), but aggression directed towards\nchicks is rare because one parent is normally present\nto protect the chick. When young are unattended,\nfailed breeders and non-breeding adults may act as\nalloparents (Birkhead & Nettleship 1984). Although\nthe pursuit-diving foraging method of guillemots\nbuffers them against changes in the abundance of\nsmall shoaling fish such as lesser sandeels Ammodytes\nmarinus that are their main prey during the breeding\nseason (Monaghan et al. 1994), adults bring back\nonly one item at a time to the chick, making them\nhighly sensitive to changes in prey quality (Wanless\net al. 2005). Recent declines in the size and energy\ndensity of sandeels in the northwestern North Sea\n(Wanless et al. 2005) have been implicated in reduced\nbreeding success of guillemots, together with the first\nUK reports of chicks regularly being left unattended\n(Mavor et al. 2005; Wanless et al. 2005). Intuitively,\nthe main fitness costs to guillemots of leaving chicks\nunattended would appear to be the heightened risks of\npredation and hypothermia. However, major changes\nin adult attendance patterns may also severely disrupt\nthe social dynamics of the colony. Our study aimed to\nquantify these risks and test the prediction that when\nenvironmental conditions are severe, chicks experience\ngreater intraspecific aggression.2. MATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe study was carried out on the Isle of May, Firth of Forth, UK\n(56811 0 N, 28340 W) where standardized data on guillemot breeding\nsuccess and parental attendance during chick rearing have been\ncollected annually since 1983. Guillemot eggs and chicks are eaten\nby herring gulls Larus argentatus and great black-backed gulls Larus\nmarinus; 2884 and 30 pairs, respectively, of the two species\ncurrently breed on the Isle of May (Alampo & Lamont 2007).This journal is q 2008 The Royal Society\nT\na\nb\nle\n1\n.\nA\nn\nn\nu\na\nl\nm\nea\nn\nb\nre\ned\nin\ng\nsu\ncc\nes\ns,\nn\nes\nt\na\ntt\nen\nd\na\nn\nce\n,\nch\nic\nk\n-f\nee\nd\nin\ng\nra\nte\ns\na\nn\nd\nb\no\nd\ny\nm\na\nss\nes\no\nf\nch\nic\nk\n-r\nea\nri\nn\ng\na\nd\nu\nlt\ns\na\nn\nd\nch\nic\nk\ns\nn\nea\nr\nfl\ned\ng\nin\ng\n(w\nit\nh\nst\na\nn\nd\na\nrd\ner\nro\nrs\na\nn\nd\nS\np\nea\nrm\na\nn\n\u2019s\nra\nn\nk\nco\nrr\nel\na\nti\no\nn\n)\no\nf\nco\nm\nm\no\nn\ng\nu\nil\nle\nm\no\nts\no\nn\nth\ne\nIs\nle\no\nf\nM\nay\n.\n(B\na\nse\nd\no\nn\na\nn\nn\nu\na\nl\nto\nta\nls\no\nf\n7\n0\n0\n\u2013\n1\n0\n0\n0\np\na\nir\ns\nla\ny\nin\ng\n,\np\ner\nce\nn\nta\ng\nes\no\nf\n1\n0\n0\n\u2013\n2\n0\n0\nch\nic\nk\ns\nw\nit\nh\n0\no\nr\n2\na\nd\nu\nlt\ns\np\nre\nse\nn\nt\na\nt\nm\nid\nd\na\ny\na\nft\ner\nth\ne\nfi\nrs\nt\nu\nn\na\ntt\nen\nd\ned\nch\nic\nk\nw\na\ns\nse\nen\n,\nfe\ned\ns\nd\nu\nri\nn\ng\nth\nre\ne\na\nll\n-d\na\ny\nw\na\ntc\nh\nes\no\nf\nm\no\nre\nth\na\nn\n5\n0\nch\nic\nk\ns,\nb\no\nd\ny\nm\na\nss\nes\no\nf\n8\n\u2013\n1\n3\n0\nch\nic\nk\ns\na\nn\nd\n3\n5\n\u2013\n1\n3\n0\na\nd\nu\nlt\ns.\n)\nye\na\nrs\nm\nea\nn\nb\nre\ned\nin\ng\no\nu\ntp\nu\nt\n(y\no\nu\nn\ng\np\na\nir\nla\nid\nK\n1\n)\nh\na\ntc\nh\nin\ng\nsu\ncc\nes\ns\nch\nic\nk\nsu\ncc\nes\ns\np\ner\nce\nn\nt\no\nf\nch\nic\nk\ns\nu\nn\na\ntt\nen\nd\ned\np\ner\nce\nn\nt\no\nf\nch\nic\nk\ns\na\ntt\nen\nd\ned\nb\ny\ntw\no\np\na\nre\nn\nts\nfe\ned\ns\nch\nic\nk\nK\n1\nd\na\ny\nK\n1\nm\na\nss\no\nf\na\nd\nu\nlt\nw\nit\nh\nch\nic\nk\n(g\n)\nm\na\nss\no\nf\nch\nic\nk\nn\nea\nr\nfl\ned\ng\nin\ng\n(g\n)\n1\n9\n8\n3\n\u2013\n1\n9\n8\n7\n0\n.7\n7\n8\nG\n0\n.0\n5\n0\n.8\n3\n4\nG\n0\n.0\n3\n0\n.9\n3\n2\nG\n0\n.0\n4\n0\nG\n0\n.0\n2\n8\n.1\nG\n6\n.7\n3\n.8\n2\n0\nG\n2\n.6\n5\n9\n7\n4\nG\n2\n8\n2\n5\n7\n.2\nG\n8\n.5\n1\n9\n8\n8\n\u2013\n1\n9\n9\n2\n0\n.8\n3\n6\nG\n0\n.0\n2\n0\n.8\n7\n9\nG\n0\n.0\n2\n0\n.9\n5\n1\nG\n0\n.0\n1\n0\nG\n0\n.0\n1\n7\n.5\nG\n1\n0\n.8\n4\n.8\n5\n0\nG\n5\n.0\n3\n9\n4\n6\nG\n1\n4\n2\n5\n4\n.2\nG\n5\n.2\n1\n9\n9\n3\n\u2013\n1\n9\n9\n7\n0\n.7\n9\n3\nG\n0\n.0\n2\n0\n.8\n5\n0\nG\n0\n.0\n2\n0\n.9\n3\n2\nG\n0\n.0\n2\n0\nG\n0\n.0\n2\n0\n.4\nG\n1\n0\n.0\n4\n.4\n5\n2\nG\n2\n.6\n9\n9\n3\n5\nG\n1\n4\n2\n5\n6\n.6\nG\n1\n5\n.3\n1\n9\n9\n8\n\u2013\n2\n0\n0\n2\n0\n.6\n9\n8\nG\n0\n.0\n5\n0\n.8\n0\n3\nG\n0\n.0\n2\n0\n.8\n6\n9\nG\n0\n.0\n5\n0\nG\n0\n.0\n6\n.0\nG\n5\n.1\n4\n.2\n8\n6\nG\n3\n.1\n9\n9\n2\n0\nG\n1\n7\n2\n2\n9\n.0\nG\n2\n1\n.0\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\u2013\n2\n0\n0\n6\n0\n.5\n6\n2\nG\n0\n.1\n2\n0\n.8\n0\n5\nG\n0\n.0\n3\n0\n.6\n9\n9\nG\n0\n.1\n7\n7\n.1\nG\n6\n.0\n2\n.5\n8\nG\n1\n.8\n4\n.2\n6\n0\nG\n0\n.9\n1\n9\n1\n4\nG\n5\n2\n0\n6\n.5\nG\n2\n6\n.8\n2\n0\n0\n7\n0\n.2\n8\n1\n0\n.7\n5\n3\n0\n.3\n7\n3\n1\n3\n.1\n0\n.8\n2\n.3\n2\n8\n8\n9\n1\n9\n4\nS\np\nea\nrm\na\nn\n\u2019s\nra\nn\nk\nco\nrr\nel\na\nti\no\nn\nw\nit\nh\nye\na\nr\nfr\no\nm\n1\n9\n8\n3\n\u2013\n2\n0\n0\n7\n(N\nZ\nn\nu\nm\nb\ner\no\nf\nye\na\nrs\n)\nr S\nZ\nK\n0\n.7\n1\n,\np\n!\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n,\nN\nZ\n2\n5\nr S\nZ\nK\n0\n.5\n5\n,\np\nZ\n0\n.0\n0\n4\n,\nN\nZ\n2\n5\nr S\nZ\nK\n0\n.7\n4\n,\np\n!\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n,\nN\nZ\n2\n5\nr S\nZ\n0\n.6\n4\n,\np\nZ\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n,\nN\nZ\n2\n5\nr S\nZ\nK\n0\n.7\n9\n,\np\n!\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n,\nN\nZ\n2\n1\nr S\nZ\n0\n.1\n0\n,\np\nZ\n0\n.6\n,\nN\nZ\n2\n5\nr S\nZ\nK\n0\n.8\n3\n,\np\n!\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n,\nN\nZ\n2\n3\nr S\nZ\nK\n0\n.6\n7\n,\np\n!\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n,\nN\nZ\n2\n5\n2 K. Ashbrook et al. Conspecific aggression and colonial breeding\nBiol. Lett.Guillemot parental behaviour was studied daily from 27 May to\n3 July 2007, focusing on attendance, aggressive interactions and\nalloparenting. Chicks classed as unattended during observation\nperiods and in midday attendance checks were those where neither\nparent was present. The study plot (nZ132 breeding pairs) was\npart of a high-density breeding area (approx. 32 sites mK2) where\nmost incubating birds were in physical contact with at least two\nneighbours. The study plot was monitored from 05.00 to 21.00\nthroughout chick rearing using both direct observations and a video\nsystem (see the electronic supplementary material for full details).\nChanges with date in the proportions of unattended chicks and\nactive pairs (those which had laid and still had eggs or chicks)\nand in attacks on unattended chicks were investigated using\ngeneralized linear and polynomial models (see the electronic\nsupplementary material).3. RESULTS\nBetween 1983 and 2006, there was a marked decline\nin breeding output (young pair laidK1) on the Isle of\nMay, particularly in success at the chick-rearing stage,\nand in mean masses of adults with chicks and of\nchicks of fledging age (table 1). Changes in behaviour\nwere also apparent, with chick-provisioning rates\ndeclining, despite parents reducing time together and\nstarting to leave offspring unattended. Reduced\nparental attendance was associated with reduced chick\nproduction (Spearman\u2019s rank: NZ26, rSZK0.627,\np!0.001). The situation in 2007 was extreme, with\nthe lowest recorded breeding output, adult and chick\nmasses, provisioning rate and parental attendance,\nand a high incidence of unattended chicks during\nmidday counts (table 1). Results were all consistent\nwith feeding conditions being unfavourable in 2007.\nWithin the 2007 breeding season, non-attendance\nof chicks increased significantly (polynomial general-\nized linear model (GLM): F20,22Z132.2, R\n2Z0.87,\np!0.001) reaching a maximum of 60 per cent in\nearly July around the time of fledging (figure 1a).\nSixty-six per cent (nZ99) of chicks that hatched did\nnot survive. Attacks carried out by adult guillemots\naccounted for 69 per cent of cases where the cause of\ndeath was known (nZ29). Other deaths not immedi-\nately preceded by attacks (31%) were recorded as\nexposure\/starvation losses, but predation of unattended\nchicks by gulls was not observed.\nUnattended chicks usually remained at the natal\nsite (the site occupied by their parents; 88% of time\nspent on-site, 12% off-site; sign test of average time at\nlocation for each chick: ZZ3.1, pZ0.002). Moving\noff-site increased the rate of attack (total attacks\non\/off-site divided by total time spent on\/off-site)\nfrom neighbouring adults (paired t-test: t16Z2.54,\npZ0.02). However, interactions with neighbouring\nadults could also be positive, with 28 per cent of\nunattended chicks successfully eliciting brooding from\nalloparents. No alloparent was seen to feed or\npermanently adopt an unattended chick. Attacks were\nmainly (79% of 465 attacks) carried out by breeders\nwith chicks (nZ89 breeders). By contrast, alloparen-\ntal brooding was performed predominately (93% of\n402 cases) by birds that were either non-breeders\n(79%) or failed breeders (14%).\nAs the season progressed, the proportion of active\nsites, and hence breeding density, declined markedly\n(polynomial GLM with binomial error distribution;\nAkaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC)Z144.0, d.f.Z19,\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6 (a)\n(b)\n(c)\nch\nic\nks\n u\nna\ntte\nnd\ned\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\nac\ntiv\ne \nsit\nes\n10 15 20 25 30\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\ndays from 1st June\nch\nic\nks\n a\ntta\nck\ned\nFigure 1.

Although the proportion of\nunattended chicks increased through the season, the\ndecreasing number of active breeders reduced the\nlikelihood that a wandering unattended chick would be\nattacked (figure 1c; polynomial GLM with binomial\nerror distribution: AICZ81.1, d.f.Z17, p!0.001).4. DISCUSSION\nFlexibility in adult time budgets and nestling growth\nrates are adaptive responses that allow parents to\nmaintain fitness under varying foraging conditions\n(Burger & Piatt 1990). Although we have no indepen-\ndent assessment of food availability, the available\nevidence suggests that guillemots on the Isle of May\nwere critically short of food in 2007. Even dramatic\ndeclines in parental attendance were insufficient to\nmaintain provisioning rates, resulting in chicks being\nincreasingly left unattended. Contrary to expec-\ntations, unattended chicks were not killed by Larus\ngulls despite many breeding on the Isle of May, some\nof which were specialist predators of seabird eggs and\nchicks (M. Newell 2007, personal observation). Per-\nhaps the threat from the remaining adults was severe\nenough to move the predators to less risky and\nprobably higher quality prey such as young kittiwakes.\nPrevious observations of unattended guillemot\nchicks indicated that, under favourable conditions,\nnon-breeding adults or failed breeders can provide\nsufficient alloparental care to enable chicks to survive\nto fledging (Birkhead & Nettleship 1984). While we\nalso noted this behaviour, unattended chicks were\nmore likely to be attacked by neighbouring breeding\nadults than protected. Attacks on chicks were often\nprolonged and severe, involving repeated jabs to the\nhead and body, and accounted for 69 per cent of\nobserved chick mortality. To our knowledge, such\nhigh levels of adult\u2013chick aggression in guillemots areBiol. Lett.unprecedented and our results highlight a previously\nunsuspected parental trade-off between chick provi-\nsioning and defence against conspecific attacks, with\nthe optimum balance at each nest determined not\nonly by chicks\u2019 food requirements but also by the\nstatus of neighbouring nests (figure 1).\nAlthough weights of birds with chicks in 2007 were\nthe lowest recorded on the Isle of May (table 1),\nguillemots were clearly not killing chicks for food as is\nthe case in several species of Laridae (Davis & Dunn\n1976; Hunt & Hunt 1976). Incursions by unattended\nchicks into neighbouring breeders\u2019 territories fre-\nquently resulted in aggression from the site holder,\nand similar behaviour in other species has been\ninterpreted as parents seeking to reduce the risk of\nadoption or mistaken feeding of unrelated offspring\n(Ashmole 1963; Ramos 2003) or kleptoparasitism by\nneighbouring chicks (Fetterolf 1983) during periods\nof food stress. Non-attendance by parents also allows\nincreased opportunity for aggression from non-\nbreeding conspecifics, as recorded in Nazca boobies\nSula granti (Anderson et al. 2004) and black-legged\nkittiwakes Rissa tridactyla (Cadiou et al. 1994).\nAllopreening between neighbours has been suggested\nto act as a reciprocal stress reducer in guillemots,\nminimizing egg loss due to fights (Birkhead 1978;\nLewis et al. 2007). Extending this hypothesis to chick\nrearing, we might expect pairs that preen their\nneighbours regularly to benefit by gaining a neigh-\nbouring alloparent when not in attendance. However,\nhigh rates of non-attendance in 2007 resulted in little\nopportunity for allopreening between neighbours,\nand consequently few breeders were alloparents for\nconspecific chicks.\nIn conclusion, we show that increased non-attendance\nat breeding colonies during periods of food shortage\nhas an adverse affect on chick survival due to a high\nfrequency and intensity of intraspecific aggression from\nneighbouring breeders. Understanding how environ-\nmental conditions affect social dynamics is thus crucial\nto interpreting costs and benefits of colonial breeding.\nResearch was conducted in compliance with the appropriate\nScottish Natural Heritage licence.\nWe thank Mark Newell, Francis Daunt and Sue Lewis for\ntheir help and advice, Scottish Natural Heritage for allowing\nus to work on the Isle of May National Nature Reserve and\nthree anonymous referees for their comments.
