We \nare particularly interested in examining these signscapes for the ways that they \nevoke particular connections between migrant entrepreneurs and a diverse clientele, \nbetween the colonial pasts and postcolonial presents, between the ordinary and the \nglobal city, and between everyday livelihoods and economic exchanges. We suggest \nthat these signscapes are translocal since they evoke material and embodied links \nbetween the street and its neighbourhoods, while at the same time connecting the \nstreet to a wider spatial network of routes\/roots which the migrant entrepreneurs \nhave taken to establish their livelihoods on the street. Thus the Walworth Road, a \nplace where a multiplicity of connections are made between different places through \nthese signs, becomes the node or location of particular types of mobility and \nmigration undertaken by migrants and their clients. It becomes a translocal street as \nit situates mobile actors and identities within the physical and social forms of \neconomic exchange, shop front displays and signages. The local \u2018multi-culture\u2019 on \nthis street is made and remade through these particular connections which are \nmaterial, embodied, everyday and ordinary. \n \nKey words: Translocal; Mobility; Situated; Emplaced; Visual Signage \n \n2 \n \nIntroduction \nNumeric descriptions of London\u2019s population growth and diversification since 2000 \nunderscore the recent growth of the city as one predominantly populated by \nindividuals who were born outside of the UK. National census data reveal that in \n2001, 53 per cent of all ethnic minority groups living in the UK resided in London \n(Hamnett 2003), indicating that demographic heterogeneity in the UK is primarily an \nurban phenomenon, moreover, one concentrated in London (Office of National \nStatistics 2001). Recent population survey estimates highlight the effects of \nmigrations into London between 1998 and 2008: inner London\u2019s population has \ngrown faster than outer London\u2019s population; migration occurs primarily from \ninternational flows; since 2004 there has been a surge in short-term migrants from \nthe eight EU accession states in Eastern Europe; and, essentially, the high ethnic \ndiversity levels in London are increasing (Greater London Authority 2008). What the \nofficial format of these statistical measures cannot address are the questions of how \nthe impacts of urban change are experienced and in what ways cultural and ethnic \ndiversity is manifested in the spaces of the city. However acute these numeric \ndescriptions are, they do little to render a complex or fine-grained explanation of the \neveryday practices of mobility as situated within local places. \nThis paper examines the \u2018translocal geographies\u2019 (Brickell and Datta 2010) of migrant \nentrepreneurs in an inner London shopping street through their shop front displays. \nSpecifically we explore how visual signscapes, or the choreographed arrangements \nof urban surfaces and spaces by proprietors along a south London street, provide a \nmedium for individuals to negotiate differences. The Walworth Road in the London \nBorough of Southwark is a linear, cheek-by-jowl collection of workplaces and social \nspaces that are part of local life. The street runs adjacent to a series of large scale \nsocial housing estates, including the Heygate and Aylesbury Estates, and draws on a \npopulation of approximately 12,000 residents and 3,000 employees within \ncomfortable walking distance of the street (CABE 2007). The close association of \nwork and local life on the street emerges through the activities of people walking, \nshopping, going to school, collecting a social benefits cheque, or waiting for the bus \non the one hand and the adjacent activities of making and selling on the other. \nWalworth Road therefore provides a fertile analytic territory to explore experiences of \nemplaced mobilities, the complex overlaps between transnational and translocal \nidentities, and the reworking of social differences. We focus explicitly on the everyday \nlife of the street through the arrangement of shop front displays to suggest how \n3 \n \ntransnational mobilities of diverse proprietors produce London as an \u2018ordinary city\u2019 \n(Robinson 2006). \nThe empirical context of this paper is part of a larger ethnographic research on the \nproduction and negotiation of livelihoods on Walworth Road, conducted between \n2006 and 2008 (Hall 2009). In this paper we focus on a photographic analysis of the \nshop front signs of over 200 shops along the street, while drawing upon a wider face-\nto-face survey conducted with 128 of the independent proprietors. We explore the \nforms of expressions that emerge out of a combination of cultural affinities and \nentrepreneurial acumen on the part of the proprietors. Through observing the \nimaginative displays of language and objects in the independent shops, we focus on \nhow connections are made between the spaces and places along transnational \nmigrant routes to Walworth Road. In closing we ask, what are the spatial implications \nin examining situated mobilities through the everyday practices of visually \ncommunication enacted by proprietors of shops along Walworth Road? \nTranslocal geographies of the Walworth Road \nIn order to understand the shopfront displays of the Walworth Road, we situate this \nwithin a notion of \u2018emplaced mobilities\u2019 (Smith 2001) of those who occupy these \nshops \u2013 an intersection of both established residents, and immigrants who come \nfrom particular colonial and post-colonial spaces of the former British Empire. We \nsuggest that these images refer to translocal connections between different spaces \nacross the globe which are evoked within and beyond transnational connections. In \nrecent years, a proliferation of debates has emerged around the formation of \ntransnational or diasporic identities among those who migrate across national \nterritories. While it is accepted that such identities are inherently fluid and incorporate \nmultiple sites of affiliation, the nation-state often remains the primary point of \nreference through which they are examined. Further, scholars such as Appadurai \n(1996, 2005) and Hannerz (1996) suggest that heightened movement and mobility \nproduces a notion of deterritorialisation and disembeddedness from places. While \npre-existing notions of transnationalism retain the nation and national territories as its \npredominant focus, they appear to suggest a sense of dislocation from place. \nOn the other hand, critiques from scholars such as Michael Peter Smith (2001) \nsuggest that despite migrants\u2019 transnational loyalties, there is a heightened sense of \ncommitment within their immediate local contexts. Through the images presented in \nthis paper, we concur with Smith to suggest that situatedness in migrants\u2019 lives \n4 \n \ncontinues to be of crucial significance despite increased global mobility. We are not \narguing for an anthropological sense of place as a bounded locale (as critiqued by \nAppadurai), but a rethinking of local places as dynamic sites where transnational, \ntranslocal, and diasporic identities are expressed and explored. \nThe images in this paper suggest a production of \u2018Translocal geographies\u2019 (Brickell \nand Datta 2010) \u2013 the notion that transnational mobility does not in any way reduce \nthe importance of locales but rather produces particular articulations of \u2018situatedness\u2019 \nwhich are not limited, as Oakes and Schein (2006) acknowledge, to one specific \ncontext or one place identity. Within the street locale, references are made to \nvarieties of sites, locations, and spatialities within and beyond the nation-state, while \nremaining grounded within everyday power structures and the agencies of actors in \ntransforming the conditions of their own mobility. Following Brickell and Datta (2010) \nwe argue that the translocal geographies of the Walworth Road include a range of \nmobilities across interconnected spatial scales \u2013 homes, neighbourhoods, cities, and \nregions \u2013 between and across different scales of locality. \nIn this paper we take the scale of the neighbourhood as our empirical context, but we \nare not limited by its spatial boundedness. A key quality of an inner-London street is \nthat it is central to the everyday livelihoods of an urban neighbourhood, but it also \nextends past the area, linking it to other places and spaces. An urban high street \nsituates and connects, both focusing and expanding the possibilities for contact \nbetween different people. A local resident aptly described the Walworth Road as \n\u2018basically a road between other places\u2019. This key quality of being between provides a \ncrucial direction for this exploration, capturing a spatial location neither at the centre \nnor the margins of contemporary London. In addition being \u2018in-between\u2019 refers to a \ncultural location neither captured by a static view of the remnants of Walworth\u2019s \nworking-class residents based on location or community, nor a segregated view of its \nethnic minorities based on origin or race. The in-between invokes the experience, \ntime and place of urban cultures engaged in the context of deep change. \nConnections to other spaces and places are central to the understanding of \ndifference on this street, and although the Walworth Road is a place of local \nparticularities, its local world is integrally connected to the forces of significant urban \nand global mobility. The street is positioned between central London and \nCamberwell, between the modernist urban ambitions and post-war regeneration of \nthe twentieth century, between global and post-colonial worlds, and between white \n5 \n \nworking-class traditions and diverse, transnational cultures in close physical \nproximity. \nWalworth Road is translocal in yet another way: while the Walworth Road is a high \nstreet, it is also a route between local urban neighbourhoods. It is supported by \nresidents living within a convenient walking distance of the street and a broader \ngroup of people who reach the street by way of other journeys. Some of these \njourneys are part of the daily or weekly routines of commute common to Londoners. \nOther journeys to the Walworth Road involve a distinctive break with the regularity \nand comfort of a familiar world; these are the migratory journeys from one country to \nanother, and require traversing great distances. To travel these actual and perceptual \ndistances, is to cross the boundaries between the familiar and unfamiliar, and \ndemands particular social and cultural skills. The capacity to engage in difference \nand change requires an ability to live with more than one sense of a local or familiar \nplace \u2013 a \u2018here\u2019 as well as a \u2018there\u2019, and a \u2018then\u2019 as well as a \u2018now\u2019 \u2013 and the ability to \nlive amongst different people. The translocality of Walworth Road then is also \nproduced through mundane everyday exchanges across spaces and places that do \nnot easily fit within the transnational analytic frame. These everyday exchanges are \nat the scale of the neighbourhood and incorporate more corporeal and embodied \nexchanges of physical movement similar to but not the same as mobilities across real \nand imagined transnational spaces. \nWe therefore situate the shop fronts of these different entrepreneurs within\/across \nparticular \u2018locales\u2019 reflecting the combination of multiple territories and cultural \nreference points that the shop signs refer to. We are interested in how \u2018situated yet \nmobile identities\u2019 (Smith 2005) are articulated through the everyday organisation of \nshop fronts that draw on connections across regional, national, or global spaces. \nThese images problematise the construction of the migrant as \u2018in here but still there\u2019, \nsuggesting instead that migrants have varied loyalties to different places and these \nloyalties are constructed through complex negotiations with these places. The \neveryday practice of arranging these shop fronts to display goods and to \ncommunicate with a variegated clientele suggests the interconnectedness between \nthe material and metaphorical contexts of different spaces on the migrant routes and \nsuggest a fluidity and variability of scales of reference that problematises national \nidentities. They suggest a far more complex intermingling of a multitude of local \nworlds on the Walworth Road: a shared terrain in which diverse references to \nhumour, cultural symbols, aspirational objects and basic needs are collaged. \n6 \n \nThe connections between the Walworth Road and the adjacent neighbourhoods \nsuggest another possibility for viewing and understanding the visual signscapes. The \nWalworth Road is both an aggregation of small, independent shops as well as a \ncollection of individual imaginations, agilities and acumen that play a role in how the \nsmall spaces of the city are shaped and transformed. It is therefore translocal \nthrough the basic economic ways that migrant entrepreuneurs are attempting to \nimprove their lives and livelihoods in the city. It forms a site of accumulation and \nnegotiation of varieties of social, economic and cultural capital (Bourdieu 2002). The \nvisual signscapes can be seen as part of this negotiation, where their very visible \naspect of economic capital can be exchanged for other forms of social and cultural \ncapital at a later time. In order to operate as effective entrepreneurs, shop proprietors \nhave to learn how to exchange between these different forms of capital. They \noperate therefore within what Bourdieu would argue as a \u2018field of meaning\u2019 through \nwhich their position and capital can be strengthened. The visual signscapes therefore \nare also forms of visual capital, which can be exchanged for particular economic \ncapital if they are able to attract the right clientele into these shops. \nThese visual signscapes make multiple connections to the different social spaces of \ntheir clientele and give value and meanings to the products sold in these particular \nshops. They situate these connections between particular nodes of economic \nexchanges and produce particular ways of understanding and translating these in the \ncontext of mobility and social change in the neighbourhood. Understanding these \nsignscapes as translocal means that we take into account the fields of meanings that \nthey refer to \u2013 suggesting that these signages are not necessarily \u2018rational choice\u2019 but \nways of transcending the divisions between structure and agency and proposing a \n\u2018theory of practice in which actions are both constrained by but at the same time \nconstitutive of a deeper structure\u2019 (Kelly and Lusis 2006: 832).  \nThe distribution and valuation of capital through visual signscapes on the Walworth \nRoad, and its possibilities of exchange is not objective, but actors on the street are \nable to quickly learn the \u2018rules of the game\u2019 (Bourdieu 2002) that are implicitly agreed \nupon. As visual forms of cultural capital, they can be translated into social capital \nthrough the development of a social network base of valued customers and therefore \nexchanged for economic capital through their patronage. A key feature of these \nsignages is that they are contingent upon the particular context of the Walworth Road \nwhere they are read, interpreted and translated through a particular combination of \nsocial, cultural and economic capital vested in both entrepreneurs and clients. These \n7 \n \nsignscapes are neither deterministic in fixing identities and spaces, nor inhibited \nindividual choice in their references \u2013 but a carefully crafted negotiation between the \nstructure and agency of everyday livelihoods on an ordinary retail street in south \nLondon. \nThe focus in this paper then is on these combinations of social, cultural and \neconomic capital, which produce different kinds of visual expression along a \nmulticultural street. \nUnpacking the multi-lingual signscape of Walworth Road \nOur first visual representation of the Walworth Road to the reader is by way of a plan \nof the Walworth Road paralleled with a map of the world (figure 1). Connections \nbetween the small spaces along the street to cities across the world are traced by \nlinking the origins of the proprietors to their respective independent shops along the \nWalworth Road. By walking the Walworth Road over a two-week period in 2006, \neach independent shop unit along the street was recorded by both a photograph of \nthe shop fa\u00e7ade, as well as a brief face-to-face survey conducted within the shop. \nFrom this initial survey, it was apparent that there were 227 units along the mile \nlength of the street, with 133 independent shops amongst these. From survey \ninterviews with 105 independent proprietors, it emerged that there were over twenty \ndifferent countries of origin amongst these proprietors, with no single place of origin \npredominating. The street is therefore composed of a diverse array of individuals and \nplaces, where for example, a barbershop attracting largely clientele with links to West \nAfrica, sits alongside a Caff run by the second generation of immigrants from Turkish \nCyprus, which sits alongside a shop proclaiming to serve both Eritrean and Italian \nfood. Of analytic value then, are the ways in which both singular and multiple claims \nto identity and culture are made in the visual arrangement of the shop fronts, which \nmust do the work of attracting a base of customers. \n8 \n \n \nFigure 1. The juxtaposition of the global and local. A map of the Walworth Road is \naligned with a map of the world, and shows the origins and journeys of the \nindependent shop owners. (Hall 2009, p. 83) \nWhat this Walworth Road-World drawing suggests about the translocality of an urban \nhigh street in the context of migration is that the local is neither static nor singular: \nWalworth Road is shaped by passages and journeys of a variety of individuals, who \ntravel, literally and figuratively, between more than one knowledge base of local \nplace. Further, the drawing captures the nature of an intense convergence of diverse \nindividuals from within the UK and across the globe, each bringing established \ncultural expressions and social etiquettes to Walworth Road. However, what this \ndrawing omits is the sense of time in the accumulation of these journeys. The \ninterview material revealed that where some would have travelled to the Walworth \nRoad in the last 5 years, others made their journey in the 1950s as part of post-war \n9 \n \nimmigration into London, whilst others still inherited their units on the street from \ngrandparents who had set up shop in the mid nineteenth century. In addition, historic \nsurveys such as the Post Office London Directory street surveys (1881-1950) provide \na detailed record of respective shop activities and individual proprietors, and reveal \nthat a mixture of entrepreneurial migrants both from inside and outside of the UK \nhave occupied and shaped the small shop spaces along the Walworth Road, since \nthe period of late industrialisation and urbanisation.  \nA fairly commonplace city street in London like the Walworth Road, is representative \nof an agglomeration of entrenched, established and emerging migrant cultures, and a \npalimpsest of immigration histories. Of crucial analytic regard then is not simply the \nagency of the individual proprietors as they migrate between places. As an \naggregation of migration patterns, the map also suggests how these migrations are \nmediated by power relations, and there is a distinct pattern of already-established \ndesignations: an \u2018emplacement\u2019 of certain groups of people as they migrate between \nand occupy certain spaces of the city. Firstly, a map of the former British Empire is \nevident in the points on the World Map, reflected in the high proportion of the \nproprietor\u2019s countries of origin being former colonies of Britain and reveals a post-\ncolonial \u2019situatedness\u2019. Secondly, the alignment of the street and world map connects \nthe \u2018third world\u2019 or \u2018developing world\u2019 to the Walworth Road, by linking places in \nAfrica, the Middle East and the East to microcosms on this London street describing \nboth an economic and developmental situatedness during mobility. While South \nAmerica would have featured prominently on this drawing were the proprietors at the \nElephant and Castle incorporated in this survey, North America and Western Europe \nare largely absent from the origins marked on this world map. Closer scrutiny of the \ndrawing therefore reveals distinctive geographic patterns of mobility, agency and \npower, raising questions of who travels to which places during migration, and why \ncertain individuals find themselves in particular locales in the city. \nTwo short questions asked of the respective proprietors of the independent shops \nalong the Walworth Road were: \u2018How long have you been in this shop on the \nWalworth Road?\u2019; and \u2018What is the country you were born in?\u2019. In some cases the \nanswers coincided with historic patterns of migration. Proprietors who were originally \nfrom Greek and Turkish Cyprus, from Trinidad and Jamaica, and from Pakistan for \nexample, proclaimed lengthy periods of occupation on the Street, often of 35 years or \nmore. In a detailed ethnographic study of one proprietor who came to London from \nTurkish Cyrus with his family in the 1950s, it was apparent that while he visited \n10 \n \nCyprus annually, and still had family ties there, London would remain his primary \nplace of residence. Other patterns of emplacement reflect a lack of mobility or \nmigration amongst those of English origin, and including proprietors who had long-\nstanding links and affinities with south London working-class culture. Those who had \noccupied shops on the Walworth Road for less than 2 years, came from a variety of \nplaces including Iran, Vietnam, China, Sudan, Malaysia, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, Turkey and Ghana. The significance of this variety points to the \nextraordinary range of cultural origins and references that become situated along one \nstreet, without any single nation, ethnicity or culture predominating. There is also a \ndistinctive socio-economic lesson to be drawn in the study of migration and urban \nlivelihoods, in this case how the practice of street-oriented retail provides a common \nfoothold for diverse individuals in the city. \nVisual signscape as a form of translocality \nThe entrepreneurship of migrants in ordinary spaces along the Walworth Road \nprovides analytic territory to explore everyday socio-economic practices through \nwhich migrants situate their mobility. But in a context of multiple and variegated \nmobilities such as the Walworth Road how do the proprietors of the independent \nshops communicate with a broad base of customers? Through their selection of \nproducts and services, how do they market or display their shop identities? In the \nfollowing images of shopfront displays along the Walworth Road, we argue that the \nshopfont acts as the first platform of communication, and in attempting to capture \ndiverse customers, visual signscapes provide an important mode of legibility in both a \nmobile and multicultural context.  \nThe visual sequence of display is a primary mode of communication used by \nproprietors on the Walworth Road to combine entrepreneurial and cultural \nexpressions, where a combination of imagination and acumen is employed to attract \na variegated customer base. The ways in which individual, ethnic and cultural \ndifferences are choreographed within these visual and spatial displays distinguish not \nonly the shop products, but also the identity of the proprietor and how he or she \nanticipates the needs and preferences of prospective customers. As will be seen, the \nparticularity of each shop is defined by an arrangement based on cultural identity \nrather than product based identity. In contrast, in many of the franchise or chain \nstores on the Walworth Road, which have a pre-established product and brand such \nas Kentucky Fried Chicken, Mac Donald\u2019s or Boots, the merchandise and brand \nestablished the prominent expression of the space. These spaces tended to reflect \n11 \n \nhighly a standardised organisation of space by item-to-shelf sequence, and the \nfamiliarity of a brand-oriented shop identity is promoted. Arguably, the particularity \nand variety of visual and spatial arrangements in the independent shops offer a \ncontrasting, more variegated view of globalisation: one in which the flows of people, \nobjects, ideas and affinities combine, alter and rearrange to create less predictable \ncultural experiences. Visual displays that describe the flows of economies and \nindividuals across the globe might therefore operate in two distinctive ways: those \nthat depend on the application of sameness across place; and those that emerge out \nof the local particularities in which one or more places are combined. \nIn many of the independent shops along Walworth Road the displays were shaped \nby a combination of cultural and personal affinities of both proprietors and customers. \nIn one Halal convenience shop, for example, the space was divided into two areas. \nThe first, closest to the street, had a range of food products, including the meat \ncounter, while the second space, further from the street, stocked food goods more \noriented to North African and Muslim customers. In this second space there were \npictures of Mecca and a small prayer area. The proprietor, who had recently arrived \nfrom Sudan, promoted his primary public display or his street frontage through \nsignage in both Arabic and English, using a selection of words aimed at including a \nwide customer base: \u2018Absar Food Store. Camberwell Halal Butchers and Grocery. \nAfro Caribbean and Mediterranean Fresh Fruit & Veg\u2019. \nOther shop signage along the Walworth Road also represented a desire to reach a \ndiverse customer base, sometimes with humour such as, \u2018Mixed Blessings Bakery. \nWest Indian and English Bread\u2019. Cultural and spatial referencing was not the only \nmode of multiplicity represented, and signage such as \u2018Roze and Lawanson Nigerian \nMarket. Money Transfer. Wedding Garments\u2019 and \u2018Afroworld Food Store. Cosmetics, \nwigs and fruit and veg\u2019 allude to the curious combinations of merchandise and \nservices offered within these independent shops (figure 2). The kind of place-making \nthat emerges out of how mobile subjects situate themselves in their own retail spaces \nis an act of communication and interpretation. It is the simultaneous translocal \npractice of translating not only \u2018who I am\u2019 but also \u2018where I am\u2019, and of understanding \nnot only \u2018who I am\u2019, but also \u2018who else is here\u2019. \n12 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 shop signs on the Walworth Road which refer to a range of spaces, places \nand connections (Hall 2009, p. 89) \nIn exploring the visual signscapes along the street, it is both analytically useful to \nfocus in on small signs, particular objects, or interior divisions within a particular \nshop, as well as to zoom out to explore the visual and experiential effects of the \namalgamation of these shops along the street. This relates not only to the selective \nprocess in the fieldwork exercise of which elements to capture, but also to the \ndiscretion in the writing exercise of how to combine images to represent the street. \n13 \n \nThe process of combining and arranging photographs of the street brought about the \nchallenge of how to group the visual shop displays without necessarily reverting to \nclassification by origin of proprietor. The survey and fieldwork data that emerged \nshowed that it was difficult to conclusively relate particular merchandise or services \nwith particular ethnic groups or places of origin. What was apparent was the \npredominance of food related shops both of the retail and restaurant type, where the \ndisplay of food and the arrangement of spaces for eating food, appeared as a \nprimary medium for cultural and social exchange (figure 3). Displays of fruit and \nvegetables evoked a rich cultural collage, where West African yams, Plantain \nbananas and Turkish Olives were suggestive of the range of individuals shopping on \nthe street. At the same time, cheap or bargain merchandise, most evidently clothing, \nfollowed by assortments of inexpensive household goods including those in charity \nshops, provided additional visual displays, which tended to be directed at shoppers \nwho were on fairly tight budgets. There were also a number of jewellery and \npawnshops, as well as betting establishments and places to cash cheques and \naccess quick loans (figure 4). These commonplace goods and services shown in \nfigures 3 and 4 point precisely to the notion of the ordinary city, where the overlap of \ndiverse individuals and spaces produces an everyday rather than exotic urbanity. \nWhat remained as a consistent dimension of this diverse but everyday \nentrepreneurship is the spatial pattern of a retail street lined with small-scale \nincrements of retail space, generally of narrow frontage, always limited to the ground \nfloor, and with a visual and spatial identity revealed in the items and sequence of \ndisplay. Significantly, this spatial pattern could be understood as a basic urban \nframework for subjectivity, or a collective pattern in which individual proprietors along \nthis street made use of the opportunity for expression and engagement in the street \nsociety in which they are active citizens.  \n14 \n \n \n   \nFood retail   \n  \n \nFood services   \n   \nClothing   \n   \nBeauty products and \nservices \n  \n15 \n \n   \nBargains   \nFigure 3 Retail groupings of the independent shops on the Walworth Road.

(Hall 209, p. 93) \n \nAbove all, these visual displays serve to communicate the multiple connections that \nindividuals accumulate and maintain as they move within and across cities. These \nparticular shopfront images are expressive of a combination of regional, national and \neveryday references. As a primary cultural cue, specific national affinities are named; \n\u2018Eritrean\u2019, \u2018Nigerian\u2019, \u2018Chinese\u2019, \u2018English\u2019 but are often placed side-by-side: \u2018West \nIndian and English\u2019; \u2018Eritrean and Italian\u2019. But the prosaic dimensions of the shop \nsigns also provide very basic references to economic affinities; \u2018money transfers\u2019; \n\u2018cosmetics\u2019, \u2018food and groceries\u2019. In this interesting overlap of national belongings \nand everyday needs, a translocal language emerges that connects a variety of \nspaces and places and puts them in close physical or imaginative proximity, without \nnecessarily producing a hierarchy in the nature of identity or difference. \nTranslocality in the ordinary city \nThis paper has highlighted the expression of situated mobility through a visual \nmedium of communication where something as prosaic as a shop front display \nprovides a surface to project, explore, read and interpret mobilities and connections \n17 \n \nacross spaces and places that are physically distanciated. In spite of the fluidity of \neconomy, people and objects in a global world, much of the contact between \nindividuals and groups occurs through regular, face-to-face and in place forms of \ncommunication. In focusing on the visual signscapes of everyday livelihoods along \nthe Walworth Road, we have attempted to move towards an understanding of \ntranslocality as a significant visual medium of communication along an inner London \nretail street. In seeking to understand the ways in which mobile actors situate \nthemselves in their imagined and physical journeys across neighbourhoods, cities \nand nations, we argue for an understanding of these spaces and places along the \nWalworth Road as translocal \u2013 that is to see these as not simply territorial or \nbounded as physical forms, rather as sites where mobile identities are materialised \nand embodied. This \u2018situatedness\u2019 is rooted in an understanding of how culture \nemerges out of the contact that most readily occurs within the spontaneity of \neveryday life. In pursuing a visual analysis of everyday entrepreneurship that is \nincreasingly conditioned by movement and flux, the translocal lens argues for an \nunderstanding of how individual mobilities are mediated: how nationality, ethnicity, \nrace, class and gender position individuals with respect to certain localities and \nconnections. Therefore, while exploring social and economic exchange and \ncommunication through individual bodies, signs and spaces on the Walworth Road, \nwe have also attempted to situate these within an uneven and rapidly changing \nworld. \nThis paper therefore argues for a production of a translocal visuality that is grounded \nin an understanding of the subtle and complex ways that individuals actually seek to \nmake places and spaces within an ordinary city. From this we can begin to learn how \nto read and analyse translocality in terms of how individuals accumulate and \ncommunicate both their own cultural references, as well as those of their perceived \nand targeted clientele. We have focused on the forms of visual display on the small \nurban exteriors of the independent shops, precisely because in their smallness and \nordinariness, varied expressions emerge and are refined. However the extent of \nsocial exchange between diverse individuals within the shop interiors is not apparent \nthrough the methods of visual and verbal surveys. To access the nuanced ways in \nwhich individuals preserve social distances, maintain or equally transgress deep \nnational, racial, ethic and cultural boundaries requires an ethnographic approach. \nA question raised by this paper then, is whether we gain a different sense of \nmigration and transnationalism through a lens of translocal situated mobilities? The \n18 \n \nvisual signscapes briefly explored in this paper suggest not only the social and \neconomic importance of a visual, and arguably more legible, medium of \ncommunication in a context where culture is complexly negotiated and reworked; it \nalso suggests that visual signscapes can be read through displays, range from \nindividual aspirations, to cultural affinities, to the economic locale in which individuals \nlive. Therefore the collection of mundane objects in the \u2018one pound\u2019 store are just as \nimportant to the analysis of everyday practices, as are the vivid collage of exotic \u2018fruit \nand veg\u2019 in the convenience store. In learning to recognise the ordinary and everyday \nadaptations of urban multi-cultures in the context of migration and mobility, these \nvisual signscapes emerge as the sites of translocal linkages between spaces and \nplaces that are distanced yet make London\u2019s incredibly diverse neighbourhoods. \n19 \n \nReferences \nAPPADURAI, A. 1996.
