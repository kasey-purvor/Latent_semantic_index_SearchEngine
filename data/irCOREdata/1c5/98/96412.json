UK immigration, legal aid funding reform and case workers \nEvan Killick and Deborah James Anthropology Today 26(1):13-15. \n \nAnthropologists have an abiding concern with migrants\u2019 transnational movement. Such concern confronts us \nwith some sharp ethical dilemmas.1 Anthropologists have been intensely critical of the forms of law applied to \nboth asylum seekers and potential immigrants, drawing attention to its \u2018patchy\u2019 and \u2018paradoxical\u2019 character \n(Andersson 2008). One way to behave ethically, enjoins barrister Kathryn Cronin (2008), is for anthropologists \nto act as expert witnesses in cases of asylum; an experience about which Tony Good (2007) has written \ninstructively, in part on the basis of his own experiences in this role. Justice as administered in the asylum \ncourts, Good shows, is increasingly dominated by technical procedures and statistical calculus: these substitute \nfor law as normally understood (ibid.: 257; for France see Fassin 2005, for the US see Coutin 2007). \nA particularly chilling aspect of such processes, and testimony to the increasingly \u2018technical\u2019 character of the \nlaw in such settings, is the way migration controls have been \u2018externalized\u2019 (Andersson 2008, Haddad 2008, \nHyndman and Mountz 2008) and the border \u2018exported\u2019 (Gibney and Hansen 2003). The British, in common \nwith many other governments, increasingly demand that individuals make visa and immigration applications \noverseas before setting foot in the country, enabling bureaucrats or officials not always directly related to the \nUK government to turn down such applications. Anthropologists and other scholars have, once again, been \nunderstandably critical of such changes. But we will face a dilemma when we are forced to go beyond mere \ncondemnation and instead asked to help implement such processes. Lecturers at UK universities and colleges \nwill be required in future to inform the Border Agency if students fail to enrol or miss more than ten sessions,2 \nthus \u2013 as many have protested \u2013 effectively becoming surveillance agents of the state, but now operating at its \n\u2018inner\u2019 rather than \u2018externalized\u2019 frontiers.3\nLegal aid case workers are faced with similar dilemmas in the course of their work with asylum seekers and \nimmigrants. Recent UK reforms to funding, allegedly introduced in order to increase the efficiency of legal aid \nand its ability to deliver \u2018value for money\u2019, have in some cases changed the provision of legal advice into an \nincreasingly administrative and technical procedure, and have simultaneously encouraged legal aid case \nworkers to become agents of this internal border. The changes, characterized in a 2008 article by columnist \nMadeleine Bunting4 as \u2018an ideologically-driven marketisation of a crucial part of the welfare state\u2019, that threaten \nto penalize \u2018the poorest and most vulnerable members of society\u2019, have been condemned by Bunting and other \ncommentators for making access to justice increasingly uneven rather than being universally available as the \noriginal spirit of legal aid presumes it should be.  \nThis tightening in the provision of funds, we suggest, both threatens the continued existence of many of the \nUK\u2019s Law Centres, non-profit organizations that offer legal advice, and attempts to force caseworkers into a \nsurveillance role, complementing or anticipating the judgments of the Home Office and its Border Agency. The \ncaseworkers with whom we worked find themselves caught in the middle between these ever increasing \nfinancial pressures and their ethical obligations to their clients. They are faced with contradictory imperatives. \n\u2018Value for money\u2019 demands that they check up on opportunist and possibly deceitful clients and even prejudge \nthe probable outcomes of cases, but it is their ethical duty to advise and represent people in need. \nIndividual case workers do not necessarily yield to this pressure to complement Home Office procedures and \nto act as its agents. Instead, their work represents a complex intersection of processes, both reshaping clients\u2019 \nbehaviour and experience to bring them into line with Home Office specifications, and simultaneously \nchallenging Home Office inconsistencies on their clients\u2019 behalf to modify its often arbitrary decisions in \naccordance with fair and ethical practice. \nCase workers and legal aid funding reforms \nLaw Centre caseworkers, who play a key role in making the legal system accessible to applicants, are drawn \nfrom a range of backgrounds. Some formerly worked for NGOs or government departments dealing with \nimmigrants, but moved to the SWLLC in order to utilize their skills in a more effective and engaged manner. \nOthers had a more formal legal education and switched to work in legal aid, in part to gain experience but \nusually in the conviction that their work here \u2013 specifically in asylum and immigration \u2013 would be more \nrewarding than that in the corporate or private sector. All have a commitment, a belief in the importance of what \nthey are doing, but many have begun to talk of disillusionment with the system and weariness of the increasing \npressures to work faster and deal with more clients, with a concomitant diminution in the quality of the advice \nand service they can offer. \nWhile it is the complex and demanding cases that inspire and challenge case worker Ana,5 the funding \nchanges outlined above have begun to discourage her from taking these on. She talks of finding alternative work \nthat would at least be better paid, if not as interesting. Another case worker, Tamara, after putting heart and soul \ninto her work, had recently resigned, unable to deal with the responsibility of helping desperate and vulnerable \npeople without having the time and resources to do an adequate job. While some case workers might be \u2018long-\nstayers\u2019 who could cope with the pressure, few, she said, would be able to continue working under such \ncircumstances in the long term. Her commitment to face-to-face contact and round-the-clock service to people \nin trouble, we were told by SWLLC\u2019s director, was unsustainable. While appreciated by individual clients, such \nsingle-mindedness can generate dissatisfaction from those expecting similar levels of dedication across the \nboard; it also leaves little time to deal with \u2018the billing\u2019 or \u2018the administration\u2019. \nThese latter, however, are key components in a system which seeks greater efficiency: the funding reforms \nmake it imperative that the minutiae of \u2018billing\u2019 and \u2018administration\u2019 are attended to so that the centres can \ncontinue to run. Payment is now given in chunks of specific size rather than being allocated on the basis of the \ntime spent on a case, and a differentiation is established between cases focused on short and simple \u2018acts of \nassistance\u2019 and those which are more complex and hence best avoided. A core element of SWLLC\u2019s funding \ncomes from the UK\u2019s Legal Services Commission (LSC), which administers it in compliance with strict new \ncriteria relating to income and assets. All clients are required to prove their financial eligibility before any \nadvice is given. Replacing the old system of remunerating SWLLCfor the exact amount of time spent on a case \n(including 30 minutes of advice to all applicants), eligibility is now confirmed beforehand and funding awarded \non a \u2018threshold\u2019 basis.  \nTo reach the \u2018first threshold\u2019, eligible cases are paid an initial flat fee of \u00a3260 \u2013 representing four hours and 26 \nminutes of caseworker time. A case deemed to \u2018merit\u2019 the extra time involved, by reference to its presumed \n(more than 40% chance of) success and after authorization from the LSC, may proceed to the next threshold of \n\u00a3765. But anything inbetween is, in effect, unreimbursable, losing money for SWLLC. The effects are evident \nin the proportions of time devoted to different activities in practitioners\u2019 relationships with clients, with the \ncalculation of funding frameworks receiving more attention than previously. The first meeting takes the form of \na financial eligibility test, after which advice \u2013 up to the \u2018first threshold\u2019- may be offered or refused. Subsequent \ncalculations of cost are equally crucial. \nFunding reforms do not, of course, serve only to constrain. Madeleine Bunting\u2019s repudiation of the \u2018value for \nmoney\u2019 mantra perhaps obscures the genuine reasons why these changes were deemed necessary. They were \nintended to modernize and incentivize, by eradicating unnecessary duplication of services6 and by tackling the \nunscrupulous practices of solicitors in certain private law firms, some of whom are said to have been using \npublic legal aid funding unaccountably, even absconding with the money and leaving needy or desperate clients \nin the lurch. But however worthy the intentions, funding cuts \u2013 at least in the case of the Law Centres with \nwhich we have contact \u2013 appear to be undermining universal access to expert legal advice: a vital element in \npersonalizing what can otherwise be a dehumanizing bureaucracy. \nCase worker and client7\nIn February 2008 Elizabeth, a 22 year-old woman from Ghana, came into one of SWLLC\u2019s branches in south \nLondon to ask for advice. After proving that she had no income of her own and was thus eligible for legal aid, \nshe explained her position to the caseworker, Ana, who decided that the case was eligible since it complied with \nthe specifications governing the \u2018first threshold\u2019. Elizabeth explained how she had come to the UK on a \nsettlement visa five years earlier to join her parents, who were settled in the UK. Having been 17 years old \nwhen she applied, she was granted indefinite leave to remain as a dependent child. She had now come to ask \nadvice about bringing her own six-year-old daughter to the UK because her daughter\u2019s father, who had been \ncaring for the child in Ghana, had recently died. \n\u2018Deception\u2019, the caseworker quickly ascertained, constituted the central problem in this case. The form that \nElizabeth originally signed when applying to join her parents who had already settled in the UK must have \nincluded the declaration, following Rule 297(iii), that she had not formed her own \u2018independent family\u2019.8 The \nexistence of a child, had it been revealed, would have proved to the Home Office that she had, indeed, formed \nsuch a family. Disclosing the presence of her daughter to the Home Office at this later stage would signal that \nElizabeth\u2019s original status of resident in the UK had been based on falsehood, making her vulnerable to possible \ndeportation. \nGiven the funding reforms, such a case needed to be carefully assessed. The caseworker discussed the \npossible steps that Elizabeth could undertake in order to make a claim, including undergoing DNA tests to \nprove the child was hers, providing the father\u2019s death certificate, and offering proof that she had been \nsupporting the child by sending money to Ghana. The claim, she emphasized, had little chance of success, not \nonly because of Elizabeth\u2019s original deception of the Home Office but also because she did not have the \nresources to look after her child in the UK without recourse to public funds. Potential alternatives were \nconsidered, including the possibility of Elizabeth\u2019s mother sponsoring the child. Here, however, the caseworker \nnoted the Home Office\u2019s suspicion of such arrangements, particularly strong in the wake of the case of Victoria \nClimbi\u00e9, who was abused and murdered by the great-aunt who had brought her to the UK from Ivory Coast. \nElizabeth would need to move back in with her parents, said the caseworker, to make such sponsorship possible. \nOverall, given the difficulties of Elizabeth\u2019s case, the caseworker decided \u2013 as expressed in the words of the \nofficial letter that she composed after the meeting and before closing the file \u2013 that \u2018although there are \ncompassionate features in your case, these may be overridden by the fact that you used deception to obtain your \ncurrent visa. [\u2026] I must be satisfied that there are enough merits, i.e. prospects of success, in your case. It is my \nopinion that, for the reasons mentioned above, your child\u2019s application is likely to be refused\u2019. [close up gap \u2013 \nthe next sentence should follow on]SWLLCwas able to claim the full basic amount, \u00a3260, from the LSC to pay \nfor an hour\u2019s consultation, a further hour to write the advice letter \u2013 plus a contribution to the costs of filling in \nall the paperwork required by the LSC! \nThe summary account of Elizabeth\u2019s case and Ana\u2019s official reaction to it, however, obscure a more complex \npersonal exchange. As the consultation progressed and Ana emphasized the barriers to pursuing the claim, \nElizabeth became increasingly distressed, trying to explain her earlier fear of telling her parents about her baby \nbefore her arrival in the UK, and stressing how crucial it was that, given the lack of immediate family in Ghana, \nshe now be reunited with her daughter. Currently disabled and walking with a crutch, she pointed to the \nimpossibility of her returning to Ghana to care for the child there, but the case worker said that she had little \noption but to stick to the letter of the law. She remarked to us, later, that under the previous system of funding \nshe would have been inclined to take the matter on, perhaps under the general legal aid funding scheme. [close \nup gap \u2013 the next sentence should follow on] \nA case could have been made, for example, had the parents signed the form on Elizabeth\u2019s behalf, since this \nwould exonerate her from the accusation of deliberate deception. Alternatively, an appeal to the judge to make a \nspecial ruling on compassionate grounds might have been possible. Although this case, involving a child, a \ndisabled woman and grounds for a compassionate ruling, seemed to Ana worth fighting both on a personal level \nand for its legal intricacies and its potential for setting legal precedents, in her view SWLLC was now too \nfinancially stretched to take on cases likely to be financially \u2018risky\u2019. There was a chance that LSC funding \nwould not be forthcoming where the chances of success were low. \nFacing similar pressures, many private law firms have given up immigration and asylum work (this may, in \nsome cases, have been in the interests of the intended \u2018efficiencies\u2019, see above). But the 40% success, or \u2018merit\u2019, \ntest is also ignored by other solicitors, who trust that their more difficult cases will be outweighed by the easier \nones. Law centre case workers may use such a calculus, too: Ana had earlier won an appeal in an asylum case \nwhich, although distinctly \u2018risky\u2019, was deemed worth undertaking by the SWLLC, given her (and its) prior \nsuccess rate. Within advice-giving institutions broader success rates thus facilitate some discretion in taking on \nmore risky cases, making some cross-subsidization possible. \nThere are, then, ways to resist the pressures or reframe them, but the negative implications of the reforms are \nnonetheless considerable. People like Elizabeth may be faced with \u2018second class\u2019 justice, or even denied legal \naid and so  representation of any kind.1 In this new atmosphere the few victories which are won increasingly \nappear as \u2018episodes of compassion [\u2026] as privileged moments of collective redemption eluding the common \nlaw of their repression\u2019 (Fassin 2005: 375). \nEthical involvement, condemnation, or public debate? \nSuch victories offer one example of case workers\u2019 creative ways of challenging the new system in which they \nfeel caught and by which they feel increasingly compromised. But what might anthropologists do to satisfy the \nethical requirements of our profession? Would acting as a witness in tribunals, as barrister Kathryn Cronin \nsuggested, be an effective way forward? Given the legal aid reforms, with their emphasis on value for money \nand their reduction of complex legal principles to a narrowly statistical calculus of success, such an approach \nmight nonetheless still be of some worth, albeit only in those increasingly few cases which actually come to \ncourt. \nDuring the period of our research, we observed an instance suggesting that such court hearings might however \nbe increasingly unlikely, even in cases in which barristers were hired. One, judged by Law Centre personnel to \nbe more \u2018complex\u2019 than a mere \u2018act of assistance\u2019 and to be deserving \u2013 because of its \u2018greater than 40% chance \nof success\u2019 \u2013 of being taken to the High Court, involved many hours of consultation followed by a long session \nwith the barrister. Suddenly, however, the Home Office \u2018decided out of the blue to grant [\u2026] asylum\u2019 to the \n                                                 \n1 Experience shows that this might result in people borrowing money they cannot afford to pay back in order to get poor quality \nassistance from a for-profit adviser, or to their settling for partial assistance from a pro bono source like the Bar Pro Bono Unit, or to \ntheir getting advice from the Law Centre for which they are then unable to claim. Such pro bono work would then ultimately lead to \nfinancial difficulties for the Centre. \n \n \napplicant. This move was viewed with considerable cynicism by the case worker, given its effect: to prevent the \n\u2018separate\u2019\/second-class system of justice (for asylum and immigration applicants) from being tested by the \nprinciples of \u2018mainstream\u2019 justice. Given the possibility that the Law Centre would not now be reimbursed for \nmany of the hours spent thus far, the case also created considerable anxiety with regard to funding. Such anxiety \nwas not merely a matter of intensified pressure on caseworkers: several of the Law Centres were forced to close \nand others were teetering on the brink of closure during the period of research.9\nAnother possible \u2013 and well-worn \u2013 position for the anthropologist is that of providing a critical reflection on \nthose aspects of \u2018neoliberal governmentality\u2019 revealed by the UK\u2019s law reforms. Scholars analysing asylum \nprocesses and deportation hearings, mostly in the US, have issued harsh judgment, showing how such processes \nmould prospective incomers into conformity with models of desirable citizenship (Coutin 2003) or definitively \n\u2018illegalize\u2019 them by providing an opportunity to stage \u2018the spectacle of the illegal alien\u2019 (de Genova 2002). The \ntwo are refractions of each other, producing each other simultaneously, as can be seen from the case of \nElizabeth. While her attempts to reunite with her daughter, if successful, would have positioned her as a \n\u2018normal\u2019 citizen with a regular family life, her past deception was unbecoming of such a status and her possible \nfuture as welfare beneficiary would likewise disqualify her. \nOne might be condemnatory of other aspects of this reform beside the coercive attempts by powerful states to \nshape vulnerable people pleading for inclusion. What has been decried, by caseworkers, the press and other \ninvolved parties, is the assumption behind these reforms that it is appropriate to use a \u2018market-driven\u2019 approach \nfor what would normally be a state-funded project. In a process not unlike that applied by New Labour to the \nhealth service (Pollock 2005), consortia of Law Centres, Citizens Advice Bureaux or solicitors will be forced to \n\u2018tender\u2019 competitively for a package of work in a given territorial locality. This proposal prompted a sharp \nquery from Des Hudson at the 2007 Law Centres Federation conference, concerning the future \n\u2018competitiveness\u2019 of such an arrangement. If one single contract of three or four years\u2019 duration is awarded in, \nsay, Manchester, what would be the likely situation of the losing bidders when the matter was put out to tender \nnext time round? What work might they have done that would enable them to bid competitively on the second \nbidding round? The laudable-sounding aims of the reforms are to enable sustainability and to cut waste, but the \nregrettable effect \u2013 after a single episode of market-based \u2018competition\u2019 \u2013 will be to replace expertise with low-\npaid \u2018Mcjobs\u2019, while producing enforced self-regulation. \nWhat distinguishes these law reforms from those affecting the health service, however, is the peculiar \ncharacter of the British legal system. Des Hudson, Chief Executive of the Law Society, described this in a \ndiscussion on BBC Radio 4\u2019s legal issues series Unreliable evidence: \nWhen you continue to have an adversarial system as the means of delivering justice, the fact that three \nquarters of the population in this country are deemed ineligible for legal aid creates [\u2026] a real worry about \nhow well this system will deliver justice. [\u2026] The importance of making sure it works is paramount, those \nlosing out will be the unvoiced. It is about the quality of our society and the democratic processes. (5 \nDecember 2007). \nIn contrast to the US with its public defender\u2019s office, or France with its inquisitorial system in which the \nmagistrate is required to do much of the gathering of evidence, access to justice in Britain is dependent upon \neither side having access to excellent legal advice and representation, and this requires money. The SWLLC\u2019s \nChief Executive expressed similar sentiments: \nIf I am a person with unlimited means, I can pay to have my day in court. This, in theory, is parallelled by the \npublic\/legal aid system [\u2026] the difference is that, under the new funding regime, we will only take your case \non if we judge your case to be likely to win. Thus the underlying assumption is unfounded. If you went to the \nLSC and asked \u2018are clients getting as good a chance under not-for-profit as they would if they had means?\u2019 the \nanswer would be \u2018no\u2019 \u2013 even though the case workers have excellent skills. \nOpinions such as these might be deemed unduly utopian. Surely, it might be argued, legal aid has never been \nable to give its clients \u2018as good a chance\u2019 as is afforded to people with unlimited means. Nonetheless, views of \nthis kind make it possible to enunciate and discuss the principles, if not the practice, underpinning justice and \ndemocracy. The ideal of equal access to justice for immigrants and asylum seekers is here put into the public \ndomain, debated, and reasserted. \nConclusion \nFor anthropologists, neither the giving of expert witness testimony nor the provision of an \u2018outsider\u2019s\u2019 critical \nperspectives need be unuseful. But where one is perhaps too engaged, the other is too little so. Our intention in \nundertaking this collaborative research project was to occupy a place in the middle ground. We wanted to \ninvestigate the day-to-day realities of caseworker\/client interactions, and to enable both ourselves and legal \npractitioners, in conversation, to reflect on our own and each others\u2019 interpretations of the situation. Such \nconversations occurred on several occasions: during a feedback workshop, again when one of us presented our \nfindings at the Law Centres AGM, and finally when case workers and the Chief Executive offered their \ncomments on the present article.  \nWe hope to continue our dialogue through future collaborations: it is by exploring the detailed practices and \nattitudes of those affected by such funding cuts, by engaging in and contributing to public debates, and by \nbringing these matters to the attention of a wider public, that anthropologists engaged in collaborative research \nprojects can perhaps make some small difference. z \n \nWe are indebted to those clients and workers at the South-West London Law Centres who allowed us to sit in \non their meetings and who gave up their time to discuss a wide range of matters with us. The project has been \nfunded by a British Academy Small Grant and the STICERD fund at the LSE. Opinions are the authors\u2019 own. \n1.
