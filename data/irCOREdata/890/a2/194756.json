Introduction \nGiant (Pg) pulsations are a remarkable category of ULF waves \nexhibiting quasi-monochromaticity and comparatively long \nduration. The first large scale investigations of their \ncharacteristics were performed by Roll [ 1931 ], Harang [ 1932, \n1936], and Sucksdorff [1939] on data sets from high-latitude \nScandinavian magnetometers. Since then, there have been several \nstudies of this phenomenon, which have led to the identification \nof various characteristics of these waves. They are observed to \noccur in the morning sector and predominantly at the equinoxes \n[Brekke et al., 1987]. Chisham and Orr [1994] demonstrated that \nthey are mainly an auroral zone phenomenon. They exhibit \nmoderately large azimuthal wave numbers, m [Chisham et al., \n1992], and are usually localized in latitude [Glassmeier, 1980; \nChisham et al., 1990]. They occur rarely [e.g., Chisham and Orr, \n1991], during quiet geomagnetic conditions [e.g., Chisham, \n1996], and it has been suggested that Pg activity is quashed \nduring substorms [Rostoker et al., 1979; Chisham, 1996]. \nObservations of Pg pulsations and associated phenomena have \nutilized data from ground magnetometers [Green, 1979; Rostoker \net al., 1979; Glassmeier, 1980; Chisham et al., 1990, 1992; \nChisham and Orr, 1991; Takahashi et al., 1992; Glassmeier et \nal., 1999], spacecraft [Hughes et al., 1979; Hillebrand et al., \n\u2022 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, \nLeicester, UK \n2 School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham, \nEdgbaston, Birmingham, UK \n3 The Aerospace Corporation, Los Angeles, California \n4 Lockheed Martin ATC, Palo Alto, California \nCopyright 2001 by the American Geophysical Union \nPaper number 2001JA900022. \n0148-0227\/01\/2001 JA900022509.00 \n1982; Kokubun et al., 1989; Takahashi et al., 1992; Glassmeier et \nal., 1999], VHF auroral radars [Poulter et al., 1983; Chisham et \nal., 1992], and optical instrumentation [Taylor et al., 1989; \nChishamet al., 1992], where they have been observed in \nconnection with pulsating aurora. Pgs have characteristic \nsignatures in ground magnetometer data: Their largest magnetic \nvariation occurs in the east-west component, which also exhibits \na resonant latitudinal phase profile. \nIt is now widely accepted that a source mechanism for Pg \noccurrence xists in wave-particle interactions between drifting \nenergetic particles and the Earth's magnetic field [e.g., Poulter et \nal., 1983; Takahashi et al., 1992; Chisham et al., 1992]. \nHowever, previous tudies of Pg pulsations have so far provided \nno universally accepted generation mechanism, the main point of \ncontention being the standing wave mode of the Pg wave in the \nmagnetosphere. Westward rifting energetic protons can couple \nto magnetospheric wave modes under drift-bounce resonance \nconditions [Southwood et al., 1969; Southwoo& 1976] governed \nby the relation \nco - mw \u2022, = Nro a (1) \nwhere co is the angular frequency of the wave, m is its azimuthal \nwave number, roa and rob are, respectively, the drift and bounce \nangular frequencies of the resonant protons, and N is an integer \nrepresenting the harmonic mode of the wave. The N=0 drift \nresonance requires the wave to have an odd-mode (fundamental) \nstanding wave structure, where the wave electric field maximizes \nat the geomagnetic equator and the magnetic perturbation is zero \nat this position. In contrast, the drift-bounce resonance, indicated \nby N=+I, requires an even-mode (second harmonic) standing \nwave with an equatorial node and antinode in the electric and \nmagnetic fields, respectively. Both odd [e.g., Green, 1979, 1985; \nTakahashi et al., 1992] and even [e.g.,Annexstad and Wilson, \n1968; Glassmeier, 1980; Poulter et al., 1983; Chisham et al., \n1992] mode standing waves have previously been associated with \nPg observations. \n10,837 \n10,838 WRIGHT ET AL.: GROUND AND POLAR SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS OF A Pg \nRecently, Glassmeieret al. [1999] reported direct \nmeasurements, made by the GEeS 2 spacecraft, of the drifting \nparticle populations, which they considered responsible for \ndriving a Pg pulsation. However, Glassmeier et al. [1999] were \nunable to make their unstable ion distribution (see their Figure 7) \nfit the drift-bounce resonance equation (equation (1)) for an \ninteger value of N and instead modified this condition in order to \nexplain their results. The comment by Mann and Chisham [2000] \nwhich followed suggested that if the real \"bump-on-the-tail\" \nresponsible was outside of the energy range of the distribution \npresented by Glassmeier et al. [1999] then the resonance \ncondition could have been satisfied for an odd-mode (N=0) or \neven-mode (N=I) standing wave structure. In contrast, the results \nin this study are based on ion distribution functions (IDFs) over a \nsignificantly larger energy range than those presented by \nGlassmeier et al. [1999]. \nThis paper presents a study of a Pg pulsation which occurred \non the morning of May 16, 1998. It was initially identified by the \nDoppler Pulsation Experiment (DOPE) HF Doppler sounder \n[e.g., Wright et al., 1997], which is located in Tromso, northern \nNorway, routinely measuring the ionospheric signatures of small- \nscale ULF waves [Wright and Yeoman 1999a], and subsequently \non the IMAGE [L\u2022ihr, 1994] magnetometer network located in \nScandinavia. It is a common belief that Pgs are generated by a \nwave-particle interaction with energetic protons injected into the \nmagnetosphere during substorms. An interval of substorm \nactivity was observed to occur several hours before the onset of \nthe wave. The Polar spacecraft traversing the dayside \nmagnetosphere from the Southern to the Northern Hemispheres \ndetected an energetic non-Maxwellian particle population using \nthe Toroidal Imaging Mass-Angle Spectrograph (TIMAS) \n[Shelley et at., 1995] and the Magnetospheric Ion Composition \nSensor (MICS) of the Charge And Mass Magnetospheric Ion \nComposition Experiment (CAMMICE) [e.g., Wilken et al., 1992] \nshortly before and slightly eastward of the IMAGE chain. \nAlthough there have been previous attempts to isolate this source \npopulation in spacecraft data [e.g., Glassmeier et al., 1999], it is \nbelieved that this is the first time that the source population for a \nPg pulsation has been unambiguously identified. \n2. Instrumentation \n2.1. The Doppler Pulsation Experiment (DOPE) \nIn its current configuration the DOPE HF Doppler sounder \n[e.g., Wright et al., 1997] consists of four frequency stable \ntransmitters and a four-channel receiver, which have ground \nseparations of 40-90 km, giving near-vertical radio paths. A fixed \nfrequency continuous wave (CW) 4.45 MHz signal is radiated \nfrom each transmitter and, after reflection in the F region \nionosphere, is received at a common location at the ground. \nDetails of the transmitter locations are given by Yeoman et al. \n[2000]. DOPE data presented in this paper were recorded over \none radio path with a ground separation of-40 km. In this case, \ne- and X-mode discrimination of the received signal was \nperformed. \nIn the ionosphere the electric and magnetic field perturbations \nassociated with an ULF wave, incident from the magnetosphere, \ncause changes in the phase path of the probing HF radio wave. \nThe simplest form of change is an 'hdvective\" [e.g., Wright et al., \n1997, 1998] or bulk vertical motion of the ionospheric eflecting \nlayer driven by the vertical component of the ExB drift \nassociated with the ULF wave field oscillations. The vertical \nvelocity, v, of this motion is related to the measured frequency \nshift, Af, of the received signal by the relation \nAfs =-2 v fs, (2) \nc \nwhere c is the speed of light andJ3 is the sounding frequency. For \nthe interval reported here, the sounder frequency was 4.45 MHz. \nThe DOPE sounder makes routine HF continuous wave \nsoundings of the ionosphere over Tromso with high spatial and \ntemporal resolution. The temporal resolution of the DOPE data \npresented here is 12.8 s. The spatial resolution of the DOPE \nsounder has been shown [Wright et al., 1997] to be of the order \nof 3-4 km for an F region reflection height of 250 km at this \nsounder frequency. When compared to the scale size of the \nintegration area of ground magnetometers (>120 km) [Hughes \nand Southwoo& 1976] and VHF coherent scatter radars (15-45 \nkm), it is clear that a Doppler sounder offers ionospheric \nobservations with high spatial resolution. It has been \ndemonstrated that not only is the sounder capable of making \nmeasurements of low-m [Wright et al., 1998] ULF waves but it is \nalso very sensitive to high-m [Wright and Yeoman, 1999a, 1999b; \nYeoman et al., 2000] wave signatures. Figure 1 displays the \ndiurnal occurrence distribution of ground-uncorrelated waves (i.e. \nsmall-scale waves observed without a ground magnetic signature) \nobserved by DOPE in the interval 1995-1998. Wright and \nYeoman [1999a] and Yeoman et al. [2000] suggested that the \nobserved peak occurrence in the morning sector may be, at least \npartly, due to observations of Pg-like pulsations. \n2.2. The IMAGE Magnetometer Chain \nIn addition to the Doppler data presented in this paper, data \nfrom the IMAGE ground magnetometer network in northern \nScandinavia are also included. The stations used range in \ngeomagnetic latitude from 63.25 \u00f8 at Pello (PEL) to 71.25 \u00f8 at \nBjornoya (BJN). These data have a time resolution of 10 s and \nare reproduced in an X YZ (geographic) coordinate system. \nSpatially separated stations offer the possibility to determine the \nlatitudinal phase change of an ULF wave as well as its azimuthal \nphase change, characterized by the effective azimuthal wave \nnumber, m, the number of degrees of change in phase per degree \nof longitude on the Earth's surface. Owing to the way in which \nground magnetometers integrate information over an area with a \nscale length of the order of the E region height (-120 km) \n[Hughes and Southwoo& 1976], phase mixing of signals from \nadjacent regions in the ionosphere results in the attenuation of \nwaves observed on the ground with high m values (corresponding \nto small azimuthal scale lengths). The large amplitude and \nmoderate m value associated with Pg pulsations means that some \nof them are observed at the ground. \n2.3. The Polar Spacecraft \nThe objective of the Polar spacecraft, which was launched on \nFebruary 26, 1996, is to make both high- and low-altitude \nmeasurements of the Earth's polar regions. The spacecraft \ndescribes a highly elliptical orbit, with apogee at 9 Earth radii \n(RE), perigee at 1.8 RE geocentric, and an inclination of 86 \u00f8. The \norbital period is about 18 hours. Initially, apogee was over the \nnorthern polar region, but apogee has been moving toward the \nequator at about 16 \u00f8 per year. Figure 2 defines the orbit of Polar, \nin GSM coordinates, around the interval studied in this paper. Its \non-board instrumentation i cludes energetic particle detectors \nand magnetometers. \nWRIGHT ET AL.'

It measures the charge and mass \ncomposition f ions within the Earth's magnetosphere over the \nenergy range 1-240 keV\/q and provides a full characterisation of \nincident ions by utilising time-of-flight analysis and energy \nspectroscopy in combination with an electrostatic entrance filter \nto measure the mass, energy, and ionic charge, with a narrow \nangle of acceptance allowing determination f the pitch angle \ndistribution. \nObservations of ions with energies below the range of the \nCAMMICE MICS instrument are provided by the Toroidal \nImaging Mass-Angle Spectrograph (TIMAS) [Shelley et al., \n1995] instrument on the Polar spacecraft.

The peak amplitude of the \nmagnetic oscillations occurs at Tromso (TRO), and the Y \nWRIGHT ET AL.: GROUND AND POLAR SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS OF A Pg 10,841 \n-lO \n05'00 06:00 07'00 08'00 09'00 10'00 \nUT \nFigure 3.

The location of the \nmaximum amplitude of the signal does appear to move to Masi \n(MAS) during the second half of the interval. However, MAS and \nTRO are at very similar geomagnetic latitudes.

The DOPE data have a temporal resolution of 12.8 s and those from TRO have a temporal resolution of \n10.0 s. The DOPE data have been filtered to exclude periods outside the range 100-250 s. \nmagnetometer data (Figures 4c and 4d, respectively), it is clear \nthat the same wave is being observed by both instruments. The \nDOPE data in these panels have been filtered to exclude periods \noutside the range 100-250 s in order to eliminate high-frequency \nnoise in the data. The Doppler signatures of the wave are visible \nthroughout he same interval that the Pg was detected at TRO on \nthe ground. Power spectra for the time series displayed in Figure \n4 are given in Figure 5. A sharp spectral peak is associated with \nthe Pg, which occurs at a frequency of 6 mHz (165 s) in both \nDOPE and TRO data sets. However, the period of the Pg event is \nobserved to drift with time. The period increases from 150 s to \n165 s over the interval 0600-0930 UT. \nThe relative phases and amplitudes of the magnetic field X and \nY components during the wave have been examined via \nhodograms. Reproduced in Figure 6 are hodograms derived from \nsix IMAGE stations and for eight intervals during the event. Note \nthat stations MAS and KEV are at approximately the same \ngeomagnetic latitude. Characteristics of Pg pulsations [e.g., \nChisham et al., 1992] are that the sense of rotation of the \nhodogram reverses across the resonance, the rotation being \nclockwise poleward of the resonance latitude, and the wave is \nlinearly polarized at the resonant location. Examination of Figure \n6 indicates that prior to 0815 UT the resonance was located \nsomewhere poleward of Tromso (TRO). As time progressed, it \npassed over Tromso (0815-0830 UT), and from 0845 UT it was \nlocated equatorward of Tromso at Masi (MAS). This is further \nconfirmed by the lower panel of Figure 7, in which Ox-r \nrepresents the average phase difference between the TRO X and Y \ncomponent signatures of the Pg. Negative values indicated that \nthe X component was lagging in phase, and the points represent \naverages taken over the same interval as the hodograms and are \nplotted at the same start times as in Figure 6. Three regions are \nidentified in this plot, which are marked A, B, and C. Region A is \nwhere the X component lags the Y component and is consistent \nwith the belief that the resonance was located poleward of \nTromso. When the two components are in phase (B) the \nresonance is sitting over Tromso and is equivalent o a linearly \npolarized hodogram (see Figure 6). At C X leads Y, which \nfollows if the resonance is now located equatorward of Tromso. \nPrior to the onset of the Pg measured by DOPE and IMAGE, \nthe Polar spacecraft was traveling northward at a local time of \nabout 1000 MLT. The TIMAS and CAMMICE (MICS) energetic \nparticle instruments on board were making measurements of the \nlocal energetic ion population. Figures 8a and 8b illustrate ion \nenergy spectra for the interval 0200-0700 UT on May 16, 1998. \nA population of ions with a non-Maxwellian (unstable) energy \ndistribution were detected from about 0300 to 0600 UT. This \ndistribution, which had an energy range of 6-34 keV, is \nsignificant for this study since such particles can couple to \nstanding mode waves in the magnetosphere. Figure 9 shows ion \ndistribution functions (IDFs) derived from both particle \ninstruments for three 15 minute intervals (indicated by the shaded \nWRIGHT ET AL.: GROUND AND POLAR SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS OF A Pg 10,843 \n1.0 \nNo_ 0.6 \n\u2022-\u2022 0.4 \nz\u2022 0.2 \n1.0 \no.8 \nNnO 0.6 \n\u2022'\u2022 0.4 \nz\u2022. 0.2 \n1.0 \n0.8 \n\u2022-\u2022 0.4 \nz\u20220. 2 \n1.0 \n0.8 \n\u2022-\u2022 0.4 \n\u2022 0.2 \n0.0 \n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 \nFrequency (mHz) \nFigure 5.

A clear and sustained \n\"bump on the tail\" is evident in the IDFs spanning 6-34 keV and \ncentred on 20 keV. There is also some indication of a secondary \nbump at about 50 keV but with a much smaller amplitude. \nUnfortunately, since Polar was located eastward of the region \nwhere the giant pulsation was detected, in situ measurements of \nthe magnetospheric electric and magnetic fields associated with \nthe wave are not available to contribute to the discussion of the \nharmonic mode of the wave in the magnetosphere. \n4. Discussion \n4.1. Ground Magnetometer Measurements \nThe Pg pulsation was first detected on the ground at-0600 UT \nby the IMAGE magnetometer network. It exhibited a latitudinal \nextent of at least 3 \u00f8 (equivalent to -\u2022330 km on the ground). The \nazimuthal wave number (m) determined from these ground \nstations was -30\u00f15, indicating that the phase propagation of the \nwave was moving westward following the drift of the source \npopulation ofprotons under the action of gradient-curvature drifts \nin the magnetosphere. Th  fact hat he period of the Pg pulsation \nincreases with time is already taken to be characteristic behaviour \nof this type of wave [Annexstad nd Wilson, 1968; Green, 1979; \nGlassmeier, 1980], and the Pg described here is no exception. \nAnnexstad nd Wilson [1968] quoted atypical period rift of 10 s \nper hour during the course of an event. The motion of the \nresonant location of the Pg with time does not appear to have \nbeen studied in detail. However, the apparent equatorward \nmotion of the resonance inthis case agrees with the observations \nof Glassmeier [1980]. As well as suffering radient-curvature \ndrift around the Earth's equator, the energetic particles also \nexperience an ExB drift due to the electric potential in the \nmagnetosphere. This effect. is more significant on particles with \nlower energies, such as those believed to be involved in the \nsource mechanism of giant pulsations, and results in the particles \ndiffusing radially outward from the Earth (see Figure 2 of \nChisham, [1996]). This phenomenon leads to the change in the \nperiod of the Pg with time but also suggests that the source of the \nresonance will move poleward. Mode conversion of the wave \n10,844 WRIGHT ET AL.'

From 0330-0415 UT the \nspacecraft raversed L shells 6.5-8.3 and 0956-1003 MLT. \nsingle-point DOPE measurements were available for this study, \nbut the sounder has since been upgraded to four paths so there \nmay be an opportunity to investigate the ionospheric signature of \nPgs in more detail in the future. Wright et al. [1997, 1999a] and \nYeoman et al. [2000] have presented etailed investigations into \nthe types of ULF waves detectable by the DOPE sounder. These \nobservations have been divided into two general classes \naccounting for large- and small-scale size waves. The large-scale \n(low m number) waves are ascribed to Alfv\u2022nic field line \nresonances, and the small-scale (high-m) waves are driven by \nenergetic particles in the equatorial ring current. The Pg event \ndescribed here is classified as one of the latter type of wave (see \nFigure 1). Statistical studies by these authors have classified the \nphase of the Doppler signatures relative to those in ground \nmagnetometer data for large-scale ULF waves. Ionospheric \nsignatures associated with these waves appear to be generated by \nan ExB advection mechanism, as modeled by Poole et al. [1988] \nand Sutcliffe and Poole [1989, 1990]. This is supported by the \nEuropean Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar measurements \nof a large-scale wave observed by DOPE and attributed to be a \nfield line resonance by Wright et al. [1998]. The observations \ngiven in Figure 7 indicate that the Doppler signature lags those \non the TRO magnetometer and suggests that in the case of this \nPg, the DOPE signature is also advective in nature. This result \nimplies that advection may also be the dominant mechanism \nresponsible for the DOPE observations of the uncorrelated waves \nreported by Wright and Yeoman [1999a] and Yeoman et al. \n[2000], of which giant pulsations are considered to be a subset. \nThe wave electric field associated with a Pg is polarized east- \nwest instead of north-south as is characteristic for low-m field \nline resonances. At the point (B in Figure 7) where all the \nsignatures appear in phase, the DOPE signatures had fallen to a \nvery low amplitude (approximately 0800-0815 UT in Figures 4a \nand 4b), and thus phases derived from these data may not be \nsignificant. The uncorrelated waves observed by DOPE and \nreported by Wright and Yeoman [1999a, 1999b] had no ground \nmagnetic signatures. Thus Pgs are important since they are small \nspatial scale size waves which still have a magnetic signature \nobservable at the ground and therefore offer the opportunity to \nverify the mechanisms which produce the Doppler signatures as \nproposed by Poole et al. [1988] and Sutcliffe and Poole [1989, \n1990]. \n4.3. Polar Observations of the Associated Particle Population \nIt is widely accepted that giant pulsations are a result of wave- \nparticle interactions in the magnetosphere [e.g., Poulter et al., \n1983; Takahashi et al., 1992;Chisham et al., 1992]. It has been \ndemonstrated that a number of Pgs occur soon after \nmagnetospheric substorms [e.g., Chisham et al., 1990]. Chisham \net al. [1992] presented a case study of a Pg observed by ground \nmagnetometers and by the Sweden and Britain Radar Experiment \n(SABRE) [Nielsen et al., 1983] auroral radar. They showed that \nthe Pg occurrence was consistent with a drift-bounce resonance \nwith a population of protons, with energies in the range---10-20 \nkeV, injected on the nightside several hours before during a \nsubstorm. It has also been reported [Chisham, 1996] that \nquiescent conditions following the substorm are also necessary \nfor the generation of a Pg so that the energetic protons can travel \nWRIGHT ET AL.: GROUND AND POLAR SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS OF A Pg 10,847 \n(a) .rviou (c) ooo uT \nDay \nDOPE\/ \nEnergetic IMAGE Ions \nSubstorm t \nInjection \n(b) -0400 UT \nPOLAR \nDOPE\/ \nIMAGE \nDOPEI \nMAGE \nFigure 10.

Chisham [1996] suggested that the combination \nof substorm activity followed by quiet conditions is an \nexplanation for the rarity of Pg occurrence, as for very low \nparticle energies (less than about 20-30 keV) the effects of the \ndawn-dusk magnetospheric electric field become significant and \ncan cause these particles to drift out of the magnetosphere. \nFigure 10 represents chematically the series of events leading \nto the onset of the Pg pulsation. It is hypothesized that the \nprotons responsible for generating the Pg are injected by \nsubstorm activity several hours prior to the Pg onset on May 15, \n1998 (Figure 10a). At this time, DOPE and the IMAGE \nmagnetometer network lay in the post midnight sector. The ions \ndrift westward, where they are detected by instruments on board \nthe Polar spacecraft in the interval 0300-0600 UT (Figure 10b). \nThe IDFs derived from the Polar data confirm that the ions have a \nnon-Maxwellian energy distribution. Approximately 2 hours later \nthe unstable ion distribution and associated wave activity (the Pg) \nenters the field of view of DOPE and IMAGE (Figure 10c), \nwhich are by now located in the morning sector. The Pg persists \nuntil 0930 UT (1130 LT). \nFigure 9 clearly demonstrates that an unstable (non- \nMaxwellian) population of protons with an energy distribution \ncentred on 20 keV were present in the inner magnetosphere and \ndetected by the TIMAS and CAMMICE (MICS) energetic \nparticle instruments on board Polar. These measurements were \nmade at a local time of 1000 MLT as the spacecraft traveled \nnorthward in the Northern Hemisphere. It should be noted that \nthe pitch angle measurements by the TIMAS instrument indicate \nthe existence of a well-developed loss cone during the observed \nbump-on-the-tail distribution and, therefore, that the omni- \ndirectional averages of the IDFs understate the fluxes observed \nperpendicular to the field direction. The IDFs were derived from \ndata sampled in the shaded region of the spacecraft orbit as \nshown in Figure 2. It has been suggested [e.g., Southwoo& 1976; \nHughes et al., 1978] that the part of the ion distribution which is \nable to feed energy into standing wave modes is that where 8f\/SW \n> 0, where fis the ion distribution function and W is energy. For \nthe distributions inFigure 9, this occurs over an energy range of \napproximately 6-20 keV for TIMAS and CAMMICE (MICS). It \nshould be noted that although the TIMAS distribution function is \nderived from measurements of H+ only, the CAMMICE (MICS) \ndistribution function is derived from the Double Coincidence \nRate (DCR) channel, which cumulatively measures all ion \nspecies, and hence includes a He 2+ population known to exist \nduring this interval at similar energy ranges to the bump-on-the- \ntail. \nAt the low-energy end of the range where 8f\/SW > 0, the \ndrifting protons would have been strongly influenced by the \ndawn-dusk magnetospheric electric field. Owing to the \nunpredictability of the drift paths of the protons under these \nconditions, it is very difficult to identify an individual substorm \nas a source of these particles. In fact, the energies are so low that \nthe protons may not be the result of a substorm. Rather, the \nunstable population could be the result of other magnetospheric \nprocesses. However, there was a significant amount of substorm \nactivity several hou'.'s prior to the onset of the Pg pulsation, which \ncould account for the observed plasma population. \nIt has been reported [e.g., Chisham, 1996] that there is an \nobserved tendency for Pgs to occur on successive days, 24 hours \napart. It is reasonable to hypothesise that the protons driving such \nwaves are of low enough energy that they can drift in the ring \ncurrent for some time without being scattered out of the \nmagnetosphere, especially during geomagnetically quiet times, \nby the action of dawn-dusk electric fields. Figure 11 presents Y \ncomponent magnetometer data for five stations from the IMAGE \narray on May 15, 1998, 24 hours before the onset of the Pg \ndiscussed here. The stations range in geomagnetic latitude from \n65.7 \u00f8 N (KIL) to 67.1 \u00f8 N (SOR). The signature of a wave, which \ncommences at or near 0610 UT and persists for 90 minutes or \nmore, is clear in the data from all stations. Although the \nfrequency of the wave is approximately 5 mHz (and therefore \noutside of the range exhibited by true Pg pulsations), the wave \ndoes exhibit many Pg-like features. It is localized to this narrow \nrange of latitudes, it appears very sinusoidal and monochromatic, \nits duration is long and, perhaps most importantly, it exhibits an \nm number in the range -20 to -30, the negative value indicating \nwestward phase propagation. The fact that it has a large and very \nsimilar m number to the Pg 24 hours later is an indication that \nthis Pg-like wave may be driven by a similar particle population. \nYeoman et al. [2000] also identified high-m waves, detected by \nDOPE, which they suggested were Pg-like and therefore \ngenerated by a similar mechanism. The observation of this Pg- \nlike wave 24 hours prior to the Pg, which forms the main part of \n10,848 WRIGHT ET AL.: GROUND AND POLAR SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS OF A Pg \nlO \n5 \no \nlO \n\u2022 TRO ................... \" \n- (b) \nlo \n5 \n\u2022 o \n- \n- \n>\" -lO \n- \n>' -10 \n06:00 06:30 07:00 07:30 08:00 08:30 \nUT \nFigure 11. Y component data from five stations of the IMAGE magnetometer array indicating the occurrence of a \nPg-like signature on May 15, 1998. The stations range in geomagnetic latitude from 65.7\u00f8N (KIL; Figure 1 le) to \n67.1 \u00f8N (SOR, Figure 11 a). \nthis study, suggests that an examination of the time evolution of \nthe IDFs in the Polar orbits adjacent o the May 16 orbit would \nprove informative. Presented in Figure 12 are IDFs, of the same \ntype as presented in Figure 9, averaged over the range of \u0153 shells \n6.5 to 8.5 for seven consecutive orbits of the Polar spacecraft, \nwhich has an orbital period of 18 hours. Orbit 0 refers to the data \nmost relevant to this study, measured on May 16, 1998, and \nalready presented in Figure 9. All IDFs are derived from data \nmeasured at locations in the range of 0930 to 1000 MLT and in \nthe Northern Hemisphere. An incremental offset of 100 is applied \nto all IDFs except that for orbit -3 in order to make comparison \neasier, and the vertical dotted line indicates a proton energy of 7 \nkeV. There are several noteworthy features in Figure 12. The \nslope (Sf\/o\u2022W) of the IDFs in the range 7-10 keV increases from \n250 km '6 s 3 keV -\u2022 on orbit -3 to a maximum of 864 km '6 s 3 keV -\u2022 \non orbit 0 (as indicated in Figure 12). Then 3f\/3W becomes \nnegative on orbit 1 and gradually recovers to a smaller positive \nvalue on orbits 2 and 3. This suggests that the Pg occurred when \n8f\/3W was at a maximum and the condition 8f\/3W > O, necessary \nfor the energy of the drifting particles to couple into the Pg, was \nthus strongest. This may also explain why the Pg-like event \noccurred on the previous day when a smaller positive gradient of \n718 km -6 s 3 keV -\u2022 existed in the IDF near 7 keV. After orbit 0, \n3f\/3W becomes negative and so the Pg can no longer be driven. \nThere are always two possible resonance conditions (solutions \nto equation (1)) which a \"typical\" Pg will satisfy: a bounce \nresonance involving drifting protons with energies of the order of \n10 keV and a drift resonance with proton energies about 200 keV \n(see also Mann and Chisham [2000]). The IDFs presented in this \npaper cover the entire energy range of particles which might be \ninvolved in these resonances. However, it is important to note \nthat none of the IDFs presented in this study show the existence \nof an unstable ion distribution at or near 200 keV. However, the \n10 keV peak in the distribution does maximise on the day that the \nPg was observed. The key fact is that energy available to drive \nthe Pg occurs where 8f\/SW > 0 in the IDFs. It is not unrealistic to \nsuggest that some enhanced modulation of the drifting proton \npopulations might be expected at energies near 10 and 200 keV, \nalthough in this case there are no appropriate measurements \navailable to test this possibility. \n4.4. The Harmonic Mode of the Wave \nThe wave mode and generating wave-particle interaction of \nthe Pg pulsation is a longstanding area of dispute. This is an \nimportant subject, not just from the perspective ofstudies of ULF \nwaves in the Earth's magnetosphere, but it has more widespread \nimplications due to the importance ofthe process in astrophysical \nplasmas, as pointed out by Glassmeier et al. [1999]. Before any \nconclusions are drawn regarding the wave presented here, a \ndiscussion of the previous work regarding the harmonic mode of \nPg waves in the magnetosphere is warranted. \nThere are relatively few in situ spacecraft observations of the \nwave fields associated with Pg pulsations. The majority of such \nstudies [e.g., Hillebrand et al., 1982; Takahashi et al., 1992] \nconcluded that the waves observed exhibited an odd-mode \nstanding wave structure in the magnetosphere. That is to say, the \nwave oscillation was dominant in the compressional field \ncomponent. In contrast, Hughes et al. [1979] reported \nsimultaneous multi-spacecraft observations of a mainly \ntransverse (radially polarized) Pc4 wave. Due to a lack of ground \nstations near the foot point of the spacecraft ield lines only a \nweak ground signature was found. However, although there was \nlittle ground data to qualify their event as a true Pg, they \nWRIGHT ET AL.: GROUND AND POLAR SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS OF A Pg 10,849 \n15 10 \na--- lO lO \nE \nlO 5 \nlO \u00b8 \nOrbit 3 \u2022 ! - - CAMMICE \n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022% : Incremental offset: 100 \n- 0 rbit\u2022..\u2022,\u2022_.....\u2022\u2022 \u2022 \\-- 'i\u2022,, \nOrbit-3 \u2022 : \u2022 \u2022 \n10 \u00f8 10 10 2 \nEnergy (keV\/e) \nFigure 12. Ion distribution functions derived from the TIMAS and CAMMICE (MICS) instrument on seven \nsequential orbits of the Polar spacecraft around the orbit (orbit 0) of May 16, 1998 as described in the text and \nillustrated in Figure 2. The distribution functions were all derived from measurements made in the Northern \nHemisphere and over MLTs and L shells in the ranges 0930-1000 hours and 6.5-8.5, respectively. All distributions \nafter that for orbit -3 are incremented in multiples of 100. Negative orbit numbers indicate those prior to that \ndescribed in this study. The orbital period of Polar is approximately 18 hours. The vertical dotted line marks the 7 \nkeV energy, and the values given in black boxes indicate the gradient (Of\/OW in units km -6 s 3 keV -\u2022) of each \ndistribution function in the energy range 7-10 keV. The positive gradient has a clear peak for orbit 0. \ntentatively concluded that they may have been observing a giant \npulsation, which was exhibiting an even-mode wave structure. \nThe reliability of such observations is affected by the fact that it \nis difficult to know exactly where the spacecraft is located with \nrespect o the \"centre\" of the standing wave (generally thought to \nbe at the equator). Asymmetric conductivities in conjugate \nionospheres could easily shift the centre of the wave away from \nthe equator (e.g., see Figure 4 of Mann and Chisham [2000]). In \nall of the studies of this type the conclusions are, in general, \ndrawn from only one successful observation. In contrast to case \nstudies such as these, which are based on spacecraft data, those \npresenting round-based observations are often based on multiple \nevents. The present study utilizes the combination of the field \nline resonance characteristics derived from the ground-based \ninstrumentation and the ion distribution functions measured by \nthe Polar spacecraft, which together satisfy the drift-bounce \nresonance condition. \nTurning to ground-based observations, there have been a \nnumber of statistical studies of Pg observations based on \nnetworks of magnetometers. Both Green [1979] and Chisham \nand Orr [1991] performed statistical studies on relatively large \nnumbers of events (42 and 34, respectively). The former study \nutilized conjugate observations in order to determine the \nharmonic mode of the wave. Green [1979] concluded that an \nodd-mode structure was indicated. This analysis was limited in \ntwo ways, however. First, conjugate observations were only \navailable for two of the identifiable events, which might reduce \ntheir significance. In addition, as Takahashi et al. [1992] pointed \nout, pairs of ground stations are unlikely to ever be properly \nconjugate for such a localized phenomenon as the Pg. The \n10,850 WRIGHT ET AL.: GROUND AND POLAR SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS OF A Pg \ndiscrepancies in magnetic field models and the deviations from \nthem caused by real current systems can lead to errors, which are \nvery difficult to estimate. Chisham and Orr [1991] also used \nmodels in their study. In this case they modeled the equatorial \nmass density along the Pg resonant field line for 34 Pg events. \nAgain, such a method has its limitations, but their conclusion that \nan even-mode structure was dominant was based on all of their \nevents. \nOccasional multi-instrument studies of Pg pulsations have \noffered a means of tying together the independent ground- and \nspace-based observations. There are two type of studies in the \nliterature. The first utilizes data from a ground-based radar such \nas the Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE) or \nSABRE VHF radars [e.g., Poulter et al., 1983; Chisham et al., \n1992], and the other involves the addition of spacecraft \nmeasurements of energetic particles such as those reported by \nGlassmeier et al. [1999]. Both types of study offer a means of \nattempting to identify the proton population responsible for \nproviding the source energy for the Pg. Ground-based radars \nmeasure the ionospheric electric field, which when mapped out \ninto the magnetosphere can be used to estimate the drift velocities \nof ring current protons. The calculations of Chisham et al. [1992] \ndemonstrated that the energy of protons which were injected into \nthe nightside and subsequently drifted round the Earth in a time \nwhich made them suitable candidates for generating the waves \nclosely matched those which would satisfy the drift-bounce \nresonance condition. From this they inferred an even harmonic \nmode for their event. In contrast o this, Glassmeier et al. [1999] \nhad direct measurements of the drifting particle populations made \nby the GEOS 2 spacecraft, and their work is not dissimilar to the \npresent study. Glassmeier et al. [ 1999] were unable to make their \nunstable ion distribution (see their Figure 7) fit the drift-bounce \nresonance quation (equation (1)) for an integer value of N and \ninstead modified this condition in order to explain their results. \nThe comment by Mann and Chisham [2000], which followed, \nsuggested that if the real \"bump-on-the-tail\" responsible was \noutside of the energy range of the distribution presented by \nGlassmeier et al. [1999] then the resonance condition still could \nhave been satisfied for integer N. Mann and Chisham [2000] \nhypothesized that the wave reported by Glassmeier et al. [1999] \nwould be driven either by a drift mode wave (N=0) with particle \nenergies of about 250 keV or by a drift-bounce mode resonating \nwith particles at---12 keV and that in the case reported, the former \nmode was the most likely candidate. The Polar observations, \npresented here, have a considerably larger energy range and a \nvery clear and distinct bump-on-the-tail exists in the ion \ndistributions (Figure 9). This lends credence to the argument \noffered by Mann and Chisham [2000]. In addition, examination \nof distribution functions in Figure 9 reveals the existence of an \nextra \"shoulder\" at almost the same energy (-\u202260 keV) as \nidentified by Glassmeier et al. [1999]. However, the much \nstronger bump-on-the-tail seems a more credible candidate for \nproviding the energy for wave growth. Unstable ion populations \nsuch as those described above are commonplace in spacecraft \ndata. This fact is important when considering the Doppler \nsounder measurements of the ionospheric signature of the wave. \nThe Doppler signatures of such waves are a current active area of \nresearch [e.g., Menk et al., 1995; Marshall and Menk; 1999; \nWright and Yeoman, 1999a; Yeoman et al., 2000]. The results \nfrom the DOPE sounder indicate [Yeoman et al., 2000] that the \noccurrence of Pg-like waves is far more common than previously \nbelieved. They appear at the ground far less frequently due to the \nscreening effect of the ionosphere on small scale sized waves \nsuch as these. Thus it seems reasonable to believe that these \nobservations are related to the aforementioned commonly \noccurring ion distributions. The observed occurrence of these \nwaves will then be determined by the drift-bounce or drift \nresonance matching conditions between the energetic particles \nand the field lines about which they gyrate. \nIn order to try to determine the harmonic mode of the wave in \nthe magnetosphere, it is necessary to turn to the drift-bounce \nresonance relation (equation (1)). An integer value of the \nharmonic number, N, is necessary for this relation to be satisfied. \nDrift and bounce frequencies for magnetospheric protons of a \ngiven energy may be calculated [e.g., Parks, 1991; Chisham, \n1996]. Considering N=-I leads to a solution for particles with \nenergies in the MeV range, which is considered unlikely. N=0 \n(the so-called drift mode) would require particles with energies \naround 190 keV. However, particles of these energies were not \ndetected by the CAMMICE (MICS) or CEPPAD (which has a \nhigher energy range) [Blake et al., 1995] instruments on board \nPolar. In addition, particles of this energy would add the \nrequirement that a substorm had occurred about 30 minutes prior \nto the onset of the Pg. There is no indication that this is the case. \nTurning to the case where N=I, however, the resonance condition \nis satisfied for particles with energies of around 7 keV. This is, of \ncourse, significant since this energy lies in the region of the ion \ndistribution function, where \u2022f\/\u2022W > 0, which has energy \navailable to be fed into appropriate wave modes. The result \nsuggests that the Pg described here is the consequence of a drift- \nbounce resonance and forms an even-mode standing wave \nstructure in the magnetosphere. It is unlikely that this resonance \ncondition is met by chance. Examination of the IDFs (Figure 9) \nindicates that an alternative energy source for the wave does not \nexist, or at least is not measured by Polar. The period of this Pg \nlies at the long-period end of typical values reported by Chisham \nand Orr [1991 ]. If a drift-bounce mechanism is applicable to all \nPgs, then this would imply that 6-10 keV protons are at the low \nend of \"typical\" particle energies for Pgs, since the solution to the \nbounce resonance condition (equation (1)) is dominated by their \nbounce angular frequencies. Utilising the methods of Parks \n[1991] and Chisham [1996], the bounce and drift angular \nfrequencies for the 7 keV protons have been calculated to be \n3.4x 10 '2 and 1.12x 10 '4 rad s -1, respectively. \nThe result of Glassmeier et al. [1999] is significant since it \npresented the first particle measurements of the proton population \nresponsible for driving the Pg wave. In general, the number of \nreported occurrences of such measurements i  very low and those \nrelated to Pgs rarer still. The results presented here are, therefore, \nalso significant since the IDFs cover a greater energy range and \ninclude those which we believe are the source population for this \nwave. However, since Polar was eastward of the location of the \nPg, it is unable to contribute directly to the debate over harmonic \nmode. It did not measure the magnetospheric electric and \nmagnetic fields associated with the wave, which is unfortunate. It \nis worth considering whether there are two types of Pgs, being \ndriven by odd or even harmonics. However, additional \nobservations are required in order to address this issue. \n5. Summary \nMulti-instrument observations of the Pg pulsation, which \noccurred on the morning of May 16, 1998 have been reported. It \nwas observed simultaneously on the ground, by the IMAGE \nnetwork of magnetometers, and in the F region ionosphere. The \nresonant location of the Pg was observed to move equatorward \nWRIGHT ET AL.: GROUND AND POLAR SPACECRAFT OBSERVATIONS OF A Pg 10,851 \nduring the event. Comparison of the magnetometer and DOPE \ndata suggests that the Pg is a poloidal Alfv\u2022n wave and implies \nthat an ExB advection mechanism may be dominant in the \ncreation of the Doppler signatures for high-m waves. In addition, \nthe result is important for current studies utilising Doppler \nsounders since it suggests that the Pg-like waves, which are \ndetected by these instruments in the ionosphere but not observed \nat the ground, may be linked to the unstable ion distributions \nwhich occur commonly in ring current proton populations. The \nwave occurred in the morning sector and possessed an azimuthal \nwave number, m, of 30+5 with a westward phase propagation. \nSeveral hours earlier, substorm activity may have injected the \nplasma population necessary to trigger the wave-particle \ninteraction required to generate the Pg pulsation. Two hours prior \nto the onset of the Pg recorded on the ground and in the \nionosphere and slightly eastward of the Scandinavian sector, the \nTIMAS and CAMMICE (MICS) energetic particle instruments \non board the Polar spacecraft were diagnosing the westward \ndrifting plasma. Ion distribution functions, f, derived from the \nPolar data clearly show an unstable (non-Maxwellian) particle \npopulation with energies in the range 6-34 keV. The condition \n\u2022\u00bdf\/r)14\/ > 0, indicating the part of the distribution where the \nparticles could feed energy into appropriate standing mode waves \nin the magnetosphere, occurred for proton energies of-7 keV. It \nhas previously been suggested that low-energy protons of this \ntype are responsible for generating Pg pulsations. Although the \nabsence of in situ measurements of the magnetospheric electric \nand magnetic fields associated with the Pg prevents a more direct \nmeasurement of the harmonic mode of the wave, the large energy \nrange of the ion distribution functions presented here strongly \nindicates that low energy protons (-7-10 keV) provide the energy \nnecessary for wave growth. This implies that a drift-bounce \nresonance mechanism, with an even-mode standing wave \nstructure in the magnetosphere, was responsible for generating \nthis particular wave. In addition, these observations are in \nagreement with the theoretical predictions of Oseke and Mann \n[2001], which reported the results of modeling high-m Alfv\u2022n \nwaves driven by drift-bounce resonances. Considering all the \nobservations of giant pulsations, three possible scenarios may \nexplain the different types of observations. First, Pgs may exhibit \na fundamental mode standing wave structure in the \nmagnetosphere. If this is the case, then no one has so far \nsuccessfully detected the particle population driving the wave. \nSecond, Pgs may have an even mode harmonic structure. This \nview is consistent with some of the ground-based observations, \nbut not with the majority of spacecraft observations. Finally, \nperhaps it is possible that the ion distribution associated with the \nPg may actually drive both odd and even harmonics (perhaps \neven simultaneously). This could then explain why apparently \ntwo distinct types of wave are observed. \nAcknowledgments.
