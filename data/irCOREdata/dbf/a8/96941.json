Introduction \nAn enzyme system of considerable experimen- \ntal interest [l-3] is the mechanism-based inhibitor, \nor \u2018suicide substrate\u2019 system, represented by [4] \nk, 4 \nE+S-X - Y \nk, \n\u2018k_, \n- E+P \nI \n1 k4 \nEi \n(1) \nwhere E, S and P denote enzyme, substrate and \nproduct, respectively, X and Y enyme-substrate \nintermediates, Ei inactivated enzyme, and the ks \nare positive rate constants. In this system, Y can \nfollow one of two pathways, namely, to E + P \nwith rate k, or to E, with rate k,. The ratio of \nthese rates, k,\/k,, is called the partition ratio and \nis denoted by r. Both of these pathways are con- \nsidered to be irreversible over the time scale of the \nreaction [5]. S is known as a suicide substrate \nbecause it binds to the active site of an enzyme - \nCorrespondence address: MA. Burke, Centre for Mathemati- \ncal Biology, Mathematical Institute, 2429 St. Giles\u2019, Oxford \nOX1 3LB, U.K. \nlike a substrate - but the enzyme converts it into \nan inhibitor which irreversibly inactivates the en- \nzyme. Thus, the enzyme \u2018commits suicide.\u2019 \nSuicide substrates are important because they \nprovide a way to target a specific enzyme for \ninactivation. They are especially useful in drug \nadministration, since they are not harmful in their \ncommon form and only the particular targeted \nenzyme can convert them to their inhibitor form. \nFor example, suicide substrates have been in- \nvestigated for use in the treatment of depression \n(monoamine oxidase inhibitors [2]), epilepsy (brain \nGABA transaminase inhibitors [3]), and some \ntumors (omithine decarboxylase inhibitors [2]). \nSuicide substrate kinetics have been considered \nby Waley [5] and by Tatsunami et al. [6]. Waley \nproposed that the factor which determined whether \nthe substrate is exhausted before all the enzyme is \ninactivated is rp, where p is the ratio of the initial \nconcentration of enzyme to that of substrate, \nnamely, EO\/&. Tatsunami et al., on the other \nhand, found the determining factor to be (1 + r)p. \nWhen (1 + r)~ > 1 the substrate is exhausted, \nwhile for (1 + r )p < 1, all the enzyme is in- \nactivated. (When (1 + r)r = 1, both occur.) While \nit is true that the results obtained by Tatsunami et \n0301-4622\/9O\/SO3.50 1990 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. (Biomedical Division) \n82 M.A. Burke et al.\/ On the kinetics of suicide substrafes \nal. were more consistent with numerical solutions \nof the full rate equations obtained from the system \n(eq. 1) than were Waley\u2019s, both results deviate \nfrom the solution when c approaches 1. This \nhighlights a shortcoming that occurs in most \npseudo-steady-state approximations for enzyme \nkinetics: their validity decreases for increasing val- \nues of E,\/S,,. Thus, a new analysis is needed \nwhich is valid when the concentrations E,, and S,, \nare of the same order of magnitude or E,, is very. \nmuch larger than S,, i.e., E,,\/S, is not small [7], \nIdeally, we would like an analytical, uniformly \nvalid solution for all time. Such a solution clearly \nshows the transition from the fast-transient phase \nto the pseudo-steady-state phase. It also provides \nquantitative xpressions for the time evolution of \nthe reaction in terms of the parameters (which are \nrelated to the rate constants). This paper shows \nhow to derive. such solutions. \nFirst, we set up the rate equations using the \nLaw of Mass Action. We examine the equations in \nthe initial stages of the reaction and also when the \nsystem is effectively at a pseudo-steady state. We \nare required to choose a time scale - the \u2018inner\u2019 \ntime scale - that facilitates the analysis of the \ninitial, fast transient. As the system approaches \npseudo-steady state, we must choose a new time \nscale - the \u2018outer\u2019 time scale - to facilitate the \nstudy of the long-time evolution of the reactants. \nWe then solve these two sets of equations for \ndifferent sets of parameter values, and match the \ninner and outer solutions to obtain a uniformly \nvalid approximation to the solution of the full \nsystem. Finally, we compare this approximation to \nprevious ones, and to numerical solutions of the \noriginal rate equations. \n2. Rate equadons \nThe rate equations obtained from eq. 1 using \nthe Law of Mass Action are given by: \nWI \n- - -k,[E][S] + k_,[X] dt \nd[E] - = -ki[E][S] + k_,[X] + k,[Y] dt \n(2) \n(3) \nq=k,[E][S] -k_,[X] -kJX] (4 \n$I = k,[X] - k,[Y] - k,[Y] (5) \ndiE.1 \nA = k,[Y] dt (6) \nd]P] - = k,[Y]. dt (7) \nwhere [ ] denotes concentration, and t time. Typi- \ncal experimental initial conditions which complete \nthe mathematical formulation are \nE(0) = E,, S(0) = se, \nX(0)=Y(O)=Ei(O)=P(O)=O. (8) \nEq. 7 can be uncoupled from the rest, because [P] \ndoes not appear in any of the other equations; [P] \ncan be evaluated by integration after [Y] has been \nfound. \nThe order of the system can be further reduced \nby noting that (adding eqs 3-6) \n~{[EI+[XI+[YI+[EiI}=O (9) \n- [E] + [X] + [Y] + [Ei] - EO. (10) \nThat is, the total amount of enzyme, whether free, \ninactive or in a complex, remains constant.

By converting to \nnondimensional variables and parameters, we can \nthen consider quantities on au absolute scale, in- \ndependent of specific units. Such a procedure also \nimmediately gives a measure of the relative magni- \ntudes of the various contributions to the rate \nequations. \nThere are several ways to nondirnensionalise \nthe system. Here we follow the procedure of Segel \nand Slemrod [8] (see also refs. 9 and 10) and \nnondimensionalise the rate equations (eqs 11-14) \nusing two different time scales related to the fast- \ntransient phase (inner time scale) and the pseudo- \nsteady-state phase (outer time scale). The inner \nequations describe the system during the early \nstage of the reaction, when [S] has not decreased \nsignificantly, and [X] and [Y] are small, but grow- \ning. \nWe nondimensional&e our variables by setting \n[s]=s,s, [x]=$pjfx, \n[YI = E~Y, [Ei] = E&i, 05) \nwhere \nand S, x, y and ei are now dimensionless varia- \nbles. The fast-transient time scale is taken as \n~=z\/t~=tk~($o+K) (17) \nand the pseudosteady state time scale as \nT= t\/t, = tc(k_, + k,) (18) \nwith \n(19) \nUsing the scalings in eq. 15 with T as the time \nscale, we obtain the nondimensional&d versions \nof eqs 11-14 for the fast-transient phase, namely \nsx + sy + Sei \n+ (l+pgi+O)x 1 \nwhere \ns, \ne=--) \nK \n(23) \nThe initial conditions (es. 8) now become, on \nusing eq. 15, \ns(0) = 1, x(O) = 0, y(0) = 0, ei(0) = 0. (25) \nNote that E small in eq. 20 implies that 3 \nchanges little, while x and y change significantly \nduring the fast-transient phase. An important part \nof the analysis is quantifying these statements. By \nsaying \u2018S has not changed significantly,\u2019 we mean \nthat the nondimensional time derivative of s in \nour equations is not zero, but is equal to an \nexpression which is multiplied by a small parame- \nter,\u2019 c. We refer to the right-hand side of eq. 20 as \nbeing \u2018of order E,\u2019 or O(r). Conversely, since x \nand y are changing significantly, we say their time \nderivatives are \u2018of order 1,\u2019 or O(1) - they are not \nmultiplied by L. We use this approach when solv- \ning the equations by equating coefficients of \npowers of f. Since E&S, + K) is our small \nparameter, we can extend the validity of the tradi- \ntional quasi-steady-state assumption (QSSA) to \ncases where Eo\/&, is not small. \nThe same constants and scalings are used for \nthe dependent variables but with T is the time \nscale to nondimensionalise the rate equations for \nthe pseudo-steady-state phase: \nds \n-= -s[(a+l)-ax-(a+l)y-(o+l)e,J dT \nP \n+iTjix \ncG=S[(e+l)-UX-(U+,l)y-(o+l)ei] \n-X (27) \n84 MA.

In the following section, we simply \ndescribe the procedure heuristically and present \nthe solutions. \n4. solution me&nI and aolutlons \nThe fact that a small parameter 0 < f S 1 mul- \ntiplies the derivatives in eqs 27-29 indicates that \nthis is a singular perturbation problem. One class \nof such problems is immediately recognised if, on \nsetting c = 0, the order of the system of differen- \ntial equations is reduced: such a reduced system \ncannot in general satisfy all the initial conditions. \nSingular perturbation techniques are very im- \nportant and are powerful for determining asymp- \ntotic solutions of such systems of equations for \nsmall c. Asymptotic solutions are usually remarka- \nbly accurate approximations to the exact solu- \ntions. A practical and elementary discussion of \nsome of the key techniques is given in Murray\u2019s \nbook on asymptotic analysis [ll]. In this section, \nthe philosophy and actual singular perturbation \ntechnique will be described in detail and the \nasymptotic solutions to eqs 20-23 and 26-29 for \n0 c E Q: 1 derived. The main reason for doing this \nis to indicate when we can neglect he E terms in \npractical situations [12]. \nIf we set c = 0, the right-hand sides of eqs \n27-29 give x, y and ei in terms of s. This is what \nwe mean when we say that the system is in \npseudo-steady state. In the fast-transient phase, s \nis approximately constant and x, y and ei change. \nTherefore, we solve the inner equations, eqs 20-23 \n(which are valid for small t), with the initial \nconditions, eq. 25. For t large,\u2019 we solve the sys- \ntem, eqs 26-29 (where T is O(l)), i.e., the \npseudo-steady-state system, and match it to the \nsolution for t of O(1). So, an appropriate time \nscale for t large is proportional to et rather than t. \nWe analyse eqs 20-23 near t = 0, i.e., T - 0, after \nwhich we shall obtain the solutions to eqs 26-29 \nfor large t and finally show how to determine a \nuniformly valid solution for all t > 0 [12]. \n4.1. Inner or singular solutions \nWe begin with the fast-transient phase equa- \ntions, eqs 20-23, with initial conditions, eq. 25, \nand because of the presence of the small c we look \nfor a Taylor series solution in the form \ns( +r) = P)(T) + ES(i)( 7) + CV)( T) + . . . (30) \nfor each of the variables , x, y and ei. Substitut- \ning these into eqs 20-23 and equating like powers \nof E, we can find the first terms in the series. For \nexample, substituting the series solutions like eq. \n30 into eq. 20 and equating terms of O(1) gives \nds(\u2018)\/dT = 0. Since s(O) = 1, this implies that \n~(O)(T) = 1. That is, s is approximately constant in \nthe fast-transient phase. Similarly, eq. 22 gives \ndy\u201d\u2019 9 (0) -=-- \ndr l+ay - (31) \nThe only solution to this equation which fits the \ninitial condition y(0) = 0 is y(O)(+r) =0.

(41) \nNote that all of these solutions satisfy the ini- \ntial conditions, eq. 25. \n4.2. Outer or pseudo-steady-state solutions \nWe now proceed to look for solutions to the \npseudo-steady-state problem in the same way with \na view to matching the two time period solutions. \nRecall that these solutions will not in general \nsatisfy the initial conditions. Undetermined con- \nstants of integration are evaluated by matching \nthe solution domains together. \nAs before, we look for simple solutions to eqs \n26-29 in the form \ns(T) = s&l,(T) = f~~~)(T)+t\u2019s(~,(T)+... (42) \nfor each of the substance variables s, x, y and e,. \nAfter we have substituted these solutions into eqs \n26-29, we once again equate coefficients of powers \nof z. Here, however, we must solve for the unde- \ntermined constants of integration, which we do by \nthe method of matched asymptotic expansions; \ni.e., the inner solution as T + cc must match the \nouter solution as T + 0 (see ref. 11). \nTaking the O(1) terms, we find \nO = '(0) - s(0)Y(O) - x(O) - '(qei(0) (43) \nfrom eq. 27, and, assuming II\/ = O(l), yco, = 0 from \neq. 28. Together, these give \nX(o) = r(o) (1 - ei(o) - (44 \nSimilarly, we \n86 MA. Burke et al. \/ On the kinetics of suicide substrates \n24 for the parameter relations). We solve the equa- \ntions for each of these sets of constraints. \nCase I: p = U(l), aj = O(I), 9$ = O(I) \nThis is the case when all of the rate constants \nare of the same order of magnitude. By assuming \n$I = O(l), we solve to obtain \nqo,(T) = \n1-P \n1 - CeTll-(\u2018\/811\/(l+P) (46) \n(47) \nwhere \n4 \n8=p (48) \n1 and C is a constant of integration. We find a \nvalue for C by matching the values of q,,,(T) as \nT + 0 with the value of S(\u2018)(T) as 7 -, co. We \nknow S\u201d\u2018(T) = 1, so C = 8. (gee ref. 11 for details \nof matching.) \nCase 2; p - O(I), 4 = O(i), $I = O(e) \nAssuming Q, = O(c) gives \nS@,(T) r ,-z\/o+P) \nei(0)= 0 \nceici,(T) = \u2019 - \u2018T1+\u201d \n(49) \n(50) \n(51) \nwhere again we have matched with the inner solu- \ntions. \nIn both the inner and outer solutions, we could \ncontinue to solve for terms of higher order of e in \nthe series, eqs 30 and 42. The solutions would \nbecome progressively more complicated, but in \neach case the equations are linear. The higher \norder terms also become progressively smaller; for \nmost practical purposes, therefore, the first non- \nzero term is sufficiently accurate. \nNow that we have solutions for the fast-tran- \nsient and the pseudesteady-state ime periods, we \ncan obtain composite solutions that are valid for \nall time t 2 0 by a simple method detailed in ref. \n13. We add the first term of the inner solutions to \nthe corresponding term of the outer solutions and \nsubtract their common part - the knit of the \ninner solution as time (T) goes to infinity, which is \nthe same as the limit of the outer solutions as time \n(T) tends toward zero. For example, the inner \nsolution for s is s@(r) = 1. The outer solution for \ncase 2 is qoj = exp( - T\/(1 + p)).

Numerical sulutions and comparison with ana- \nlytic solutions \nTo assess the accuracy of our analytic solu- \ntions, we compared results from our analysis with \nthose obtained by solving the dimensional system, \neqs 11-14, numerically. Since the numerical anal- \nysis was carried out on the dimensional system, \nthe. nondimensional concentrations were multi- \nplied )by their scale factors before plotting for ease \nof comparison. Previous authors [5,6] have been \nable to match only S and Ei values with their \nmodels. With our procedure we can evaluate the \nintermediate concentrations as well. \nThe first two terms of the composite solutions \nare compared to previous and numerical solutions \nin fig. 1. We see that the present solutions are at \nleast as accurate as previous approximations, and \nmore accurate for most of the reaction. \nFig. 2 shows the approximations of Waley [5] \nand Tatsunami et al.

The first \nterm of the case 2 composite solution as previ- \nously given was used for each of X and Y. These \nintermediate results are much more accurate than \nany pseudo-steady state method has been able to \nachieve, since the present method incorporates the \nvariation of the intermediate time derivatives prior \nto the pseudesteady state. \n6. Discussion \nThe above results show that the solutions de- \nscribed here are a valid approximation of the \nkinetics of the suicide substrate system. The solu- \ntions for S and Ei are more accurate than those of \nprevious attempts [5,6] for &-,\/SO = O(l), espe- \ncially in the inner domain (small time), which is \nby definition ignored by any pseudo-steady-state \nmethod. It should be noted that solutions may be \nderived for E,\/S, of other magnitudes by the \nsame method. Moreover, the method developed \nhere is particularly useful in estimating the inter- \nmediate (X and Y) concentrations which no pre- \nvious analysis has been able to do. Perhaps the \nmost important result of the method described \nhere is that solutions are obtained analytically in \nterms of the kinetic parameters. These solutions \nmay be used to estimate the parameters by the \nmethods described by Waley [14] and Duggleby \n[7]. Such analytical solutions are especially im- \nportant when the equations are stiff, i.e., when \nsmall parameters multiply derivatives in the dif- \nferential equation system, when numerical solu- \ntions are notoriously difficult to compute accu- \nrately. \nAcknowiedgements \nJ.D.M. dedicates this article to his long-time \nfriend, colleague and mentor, Jeffries Wyman, who \nwas primarily responsible for J.D.M. becoming a \nmathematical biologist.
