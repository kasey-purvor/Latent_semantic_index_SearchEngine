Research into socially-relevant articulatory\nvariation is missing and the complex and unpredictable relationship that exists\nbetween the sounds of speech and the vocal tract configurations that generate\nthem has remained the preserve of experimental laboratory-based phonetics\n(except see Wright and Kerswill 1989; Kerswill and Wright 1990). In order to\nstudy how speakers physically create the sounds that signal social meaning,\nC\u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011\n9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK, and 350 Main Street, Malden MA 02148, USA\nSOCIAL STRATIFICATION OF TONGUE SHAPE 257\nnew analysis techniques are needed. We use ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI)\nin order to investigate sociolinguistic variables at the articulatory level and\nfind unexpected socially-stratified articulatory variation. We will suggest that\narticulatorydataare anessential component inan integratedaccount of socially-\nstratified variation.\n1.2 Background: Social stratification of postvocalic Scottish \/r\/\nOver the past four decades, sociolinguistic research carried outmainly in central\nScotland (encompassing the major cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh and their\nassociated conurbations) has shown that sociophonetic variation in postvocalic\n\/r\/ is becoming increasingly complex. Romaine (1979) was perhaps the first to\npoint out that the increased sociolinguistic complexity of \/r\/ variation in eastern\ncentralScottishspeechcouldbe linguisticchange inprogress.Thesocial indexical\nfunction of weak and strong postvocalic \/r\/ variants, as observed by Romaine\n(1979) and Speitel and Johnston (1983) in Edinburgh and byMacafee (1983) in\nGlasgow, seems to have become more clearly defined over subsequent decades.\nContrary to the assumption that middle-class (MC) speech would become more\nr-less after the Received Pronunciation (RP) prestige model (see Aitken 1979:\n111\u2013114), MC speakers have in fact becomemore r-ful and today typically use a\nstrongly rhotic postvocalic \/r\/ variant, usually labelled as retroflex, e.g. far [fa\u0002].\nWorking-class (WC) speakers, on the other hand, have become increasingly\nderhoticised, i.e. they often produce \/r\/s with weak rhoticity and flat, vowel-like\nformants. These variants are often weakened to the point where they are heard\nas little more than a pharyngealised, or even a plain, vowel with no apparent\n\/r\/ present, e.g. [f\u0251(\u0004)] (Stuart-Smith 2003; Lawson, Stuart-Smith and Scobbie\n2008).\nAt the same time, even trying to achieve an adequate description of the\nsociophonetic variation in postvocalic \/r\/, based only on auditory data, has\nproved difficult, and this was not resolved with acoustic analysis (Stuart-\nSmith 2007). In fact, we were confronted by a more general problem faced\nby sociolinguists, namely that a deeper understanding of phonological variation\nand change requires information closer to speech production itself, that is, an\ninvestigation of articulation is required.\nIn 2007 and 2008, we collected ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) corpora\nin eastern central Scotland to investigate the variation from a more direct,\narticulatory perspective. A study of tokens of prepausal derhoticised \/r\/ in the\n2007 corpora showed that the tongue-tip raising gesture of (post)alveolar \/r\/\nwas still present, but delayed beyond the offset of voicing and therefore weak or\ninaudible, explaining why auditory and acoustic analyses of these variants are\nso difficult (Lawson, Stuart-Smith and Scobbie 2008; cf. McMahon, Foulkes and\nTollfree 1994: 304\u2013305).\nIn this paper, we show how gestural delay only partly explains the social\npatterning in auditory variation for Scottish English postvocalic \/r\/. Here, we\nC\u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011\n258 LAWSON ET AL.\ndemonstrate that another aspect of articulation\u2013 fundamentally different tongue\nconfigurations \u2013 is also a crucial factor. Our findings are particularly interesting\ngiven that this difference has been claimed to be inaudible in other varieties of\nEnglish (Guenther et al. 1999; Twist et al. 2007).\n2. THE CORPUS AND DATA COLLECTION\nThe data used in this study come from a socially-stratified UTI corpus \u2018ECB08\u2019,\ncollected in the eastern Central Belt of Scotland in 2008 (Scobbie, Stuart-\nSmith and Lawson 2008). Recordings were collected in two locations: the\ncity of Edinburgh and the New Town of Livingston, 12 km west of Edinburgh\n(and around 30 km east of the western city of Glasgow). Adolescents from an\nEdinburgh fee-paying school and from a state-sector school in an economically\ndeprived area of Livingston2 made up broadly distinguished socio-economic\ngroups of middle- and working-class speakers respectively. Four male and four\nfemale volunteers from the school in Livingston and three male and four female\nvolunteers from the school in Edinburghwere recorded (UTI and audio) in same-\ngenderdyadshavingaconversation for20minutesandthen individually reading\na word list aloud. The data presented here is taken from the word-list section of\nthe corpus.\nFull methodological details can be found in Scobbie, Stuart-Smith and Lawson\n(2008)andLawsonet al. (2010), but briefly, speakersworea lightweightheadset\nto stabilise theultrasoundprobeunder the chin (seeScobbie,Wrenchandvander\nLinden 2008). Articulate Assistant Advanced software (Wrench 2007) was used\nto capture audio and video data at 30 video frames per second. Written prompts\n(lexical items containing postvocalic \/r\/ and \/l\/, vowels flanked by labial and\nglottal consonants, and distracters) were presented to informants via a monitor.\nThe researchers were in an adjacent room during recordings. Subsequent\ndebriefing of informants showed that none had guessed our particular focus\non \/r\/.\n3. DATA ANALYSIS\nBoyce and Espy-Wilson (1997) suggested that, in American English,\ncoarticulation may lead to varied articulatory strategies for the production of\n\/r\/. In order to focus solely on socially-motivated variation, avoiding variation\nthat could be attributed to anticipatory coarticulation, 12 words containing a\nvariety of vowel qualities and ending in \/r\/: beer, bear, far, bar, par, purr, fur, for,\nbore, poor, sure and purewere chosen from the corpus for analysis.\nImpressionistic auditory and visual classification of the audio and video data\nwere undertaken independently to investigate whether speakers from different\nbackgroundswereusingdifferentunderlying tongueconfigurationsandwhether\nvariation in tongue configuration correlated with auditory impression of rhotic\nstrength. Auditory and visual UTI classification was undertaken by two of the\nC\u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011\nSOCIAL STRATIFICATION OF TONGUE SHAPE 259\nauthors (EL and JMS), who are both phonetically-trained native speakers of\nScottish English.\n3.1 Auditory classification\nInorder toavoidmaking judgments basedonprior knowledgeof speaker identity,\nEL and JMS rated each token of \/r\/ using a Praat MFC (Multiple Forced Choice)\nexperiment interface. The raters were asked to \u2018choose the closest allophone\u2019 to\nthe \/r\/ found in each of the 147 CVr## words played in random order. A set of\nfour allophonic categories plus a \u2018no \/r\/\u2019 category were arranged running from\nweakly rhotic to strongly rhotic on the experiment interface as follows:\n\u2022 \u2018no \/r\/\u2019 \u00d8;\n\u2022 derhotacised \/r\/ [V\u0004];\n\u2022 alveolar approximant \/r\/ [\u00ae];\n\u2022 retroflex \/r\/ [\u0002]; and\n\u2022 schwar [\u0002].3\nUp to twenty replays of each word were allowed.\n3.2 Articulatory classification\nA system of articulatory classification had to be established before visual\njudgment of tongue configuration could take place. Initial attempts at\ncategorization made reference to Delattre and Freeman\u2019s (1968) classic\ncineradiographic study of British4 and American \/r\/. However, the different\ninstrumental techniques and accent varieties used in Delattre and Freeman\n(1968) and the present studymade it very difficult to unambiguously match the\nECB08 corpus images to Delattre and Freeman\u2019s categories.\nA new broader classificatory system was developed for the present study. The\nnew classificatory system was developed after several reviews of the data and\ncareful comparison of tongue shapes. No acoustic data were used during the\narticulatory classification, but the identity of each speaker was known.\nWe were able to classify the tongue gestures at the point of maximum\nconstriction for \/r\/ into four categories: TIP UP, FRONT UP, FRONT BUNCHED and\nMID BUNCHED.\n\u2022 TIP UP describes an articulation where the overall shape of the tongue surface\nis either straight and steep, or a concave shape, suggesting retroflexion.\n\u2022 FRONT UP describes an articulation where the tongue surface forms a smooth\nconvex curve. There is no distinct bunching of the tongue front or dip behind\nthe front region.\n\u2022 FRONT BUNCHED describes an articulation where the front of the tongue has a\ndistinctly bunched configuration (the tip and blade remain lower than the\nrest of the tongue front). A dip in the tongue\u2019s surface behind the bunched\nsection is also apparent.\nC\u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011\n260 LAWSON ET AL.\n\u2022 MID BUNCHED describes an articulation where the front, blade and tip are low,\nwhile the middle of the tongue is raised towards the hard palate.\nThe crucial distinguishing feature between tip\/front up variants and bunched\nvariants is that in the former the tongue tip forms the primary constriction for\n\/r\/, while in the latter, it is the bunched tongue front to mid-dorsum that forms\nthe primary constriction.\nAlthough the tongue configurations in the present study have been assigned\nto discrete categories after Delattre and Freeman (1968), these articulatory\ncategories might be viewed as ranges on a continuum. In their MRI-based\nstudy of American English \/r\/, Zhou et al. (2008) also acknowledge the complex\narticulatory variability of \/r\/, but point to the maximal contrast of the retroflex\nand bunched \/r\/ variants (Zhou et al. 2008: 4466). This is also the case in\nthe present study, where tip up and mid bunched \/r\/ seem to represent poles at\neither endof anarticulatory continuum.For this reason, in the analysis of tongue\narticulation (section 3.2), the categories are organized as a continuum, so that\ngeneral tendencies towards tip up or bunched articulations can be identified.\nWaterfall diagrams in Figure 1, below, shows tongue surface outlines for\nFigure 1: Sequences of tongue contours, sampled every 30 ms throughout words\nending in \/ar\/, showing the dynamic movement of the tongue.

RESULTS\n4.1 Auditory classification results\nOf the 147 auditory rated tokens, only 136 tokens were used in this analysis,\ncorresponding to the 136 rateable articulatory tokens. In the auditory rating\nstudy, EL and JMS were in exact agreement for 49 percent of the tokens of \/r\/.\nWithonecategory leeway, thisbecame90percentagreement.Variationbetween\nthe two raters was not predictably in one direction or the other; for example,\ntokens classified byELas \u2018derhoticised\u2019might be classified as \u2018r-less\u2019 by JMSor vice\nversa. In order to incorporate the judgements of the two auditory raters, the five-\npoint classification scale was expanded to a nine-point classification scale, and\nclassifications that were one category apart were assigned to an intermediate\ncategory. The remaining 14 tokens were listened to again independently by\nEL and JMS using the same Praat MFC experiment interface and reclassified,\nbringing EL and JMS\u2019s classification of 13 of the tokens within one category of\none another. The remaining token was jointly agreed upon.\nFigure 2 shows the percentage makeup of auditory variants used by each of\nthe socio-economic\/gender groups in the study as judged by EL and JMS. TheUTI\nvideo recordings of MCmale informant EM4\u2019s tongue movements were unclear,\npossibly due to rotation of the probe during recording. Therefore, no attempt\nwas made to classify the variants found in his audio recordings. Percentages of\nauditory variants used by each socio-economic\/gender group were calculated\nfrom raw scores. The lightest shades of grey represent auditory variants at the\nFigure2: Thepercentageofauditoryvariantsusedbyeachsocio-economicandgender\ngroup (N = 136).

At a glance, each\nsocio-economic group\u2019s preference for variants at opposite ends of the auditory\ncontinuum is confirmed, with the WC group using more weakly rhotic variants\n(pale bars) and the MC group preferring strongly rhotic variants (dark bars).\nFemale MC informants used a more restricted set of variants than the other\ngroups in the study and these variants were generally strongly rhotic in quality;\nfor instance, theMC femalesmade greatest use of schwar-type variants. A similar\npreference by female informants was also found by Plug and Ogden (2003) in\ntheir study of post-vocalic \/r\/ in Dutch.\nThere is some gender differentiation between theWCmales and females, with\nWC males using the most weakly rhotic variants more often than WC females.\nFigure 2 also seems to show that WC males use variants with a strong rhotic\nqualitymore often than theWC females. However, these strongly rhotic variants\noccurred mainly in the speech of one individual (see section 4.2).\nThemeanauditory classification scores for each socio-economic\/gender group\nare shown inTable1.A two-wayANOVAwas run includingSocialClass,Gender,\nand their interaction. The interaction was not significant, therefore the results\nreported below are from a Social Class and Gender main effects model, which\nshowed a significant main effect for both Social Class F(1,135) = 141.948, p <\n0.001 and Gender F(1,135) = 4.853, p < 0.05.\nTo summarise, the auditory analysis confirms that the informants in this study\nconform to the pattern observed in earlier Central Belt studies (Romaine 1979;\nMacafee 1983; Speitel and Johnston 1983; Stuart-Smith 1999, 2003, 2007),\nwhereby auditory strength of \/r\/ indexes Social Class and Gender.\n4.2 Impressionistic articulatory analysis\nSpeaker EM4\u2019s recordings were not used in the study as they were not clearly\nvisible. EL and JMS were able to classify 136 of the remaining 147 dynamic\ntongue movements according to the four categories detailed in section 3.2. The\nremaining recordings were not classified because the quality of the UTI video\nwas poor.\nFigure 3 shows the average percentages of each of the four dynamic\narticulatory variants used in the classification system, organized according to\nC\u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011\nSOCIAL STRATIFICATION OF TONGUE SHAPE 263\nFigure 3: The percentage of articulatory variants used by each socio-economic and\ngender group (N = 136). The shades of grey ranging from pale to dark represent tip\nup, front up, front bunched and mid bunched articulatory variants, respectively\nsocio-economic\/gender group. Paler shades of grey represent tip up and front up\narticulations of \/r\/, while darker shades of grey represent front bunched andmid\nbunched articulations of \/r\/. A divide along socio-economic class lines is again\napparent in Figure 3; a 2 \u00d7 2 Pearson\u2019s Chi-square test showed that there was\na relationship between use of tip\/front up and bunched variants and social class\n\u03c72 = 55.479, p < 0.001 (N = 136); MC informants used greater proportions\nof bunched variants than the WC informants. There was also a relationship\nbetween use of tip\/front up and bunched variants and gender, \u03c72 = 11.230, p<\n0.01 (N=136),with females usinggreater proportions of bunchedvariants than\nmales (although this difference in usage was mainly found in the WC speaker\ngroup). The articulations of WC male informant LM15 account for the entire\n21 percent of bunched variants in the WCmale group.\nFor the purposes of illustration, comparison and transparency, Figure 4 shows\nnine to 12 overlaid outlines of the tongue surface per informant, taken from\na UTI video frame at the point of maximum constriction for \/r\/. The tongue\nsurfaces were fitted using Articulate Assistant Advanced software, an automatic\nedge-detection tool and manual correction. The number of tongue outlines per\ninformant is variable due to the fact that some UTI video recordings were not\nsufficientlyclear toallowunambiguous identificationof thepositionof the tongue\nsurface.\nMost of the speakers in the study are consistent in their production of\npostvocalic \/r\/, with the exception of LM17 who used a noticeably different\ntongue configuration in his pronunciation of the \/r\/ in purr and fur, involving\nsimultaneous raising and retracting of the tongue dorsum, retraction of the\ntongue root and retroflection of the tongue tip and blade. The preceding vowel\nenvironment seems to influence choice of articulation of \/r\/ for this speaker. The\nresulting auditory quality was of a voiceless pharyngealised vowel. Unlike other\nC\u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011\n264 LAWSON ET AL.\nFigure 4: All tongue surface splines (between nine and 12 splines per informant)\norganized by socio-economic and gender group. Above each set of tongue splines is a\nhard-palate surface trace from that speaker\nspeakers in his socio-gender group, LM15 uses bunched variants exclusively. To\nexplore this unusual result more, this speaker\u2019s conversational recordings were\nexamined in order to see if bunched \/r\/ was typical in his spontaneous speech\nstyle. Eighteen tokens of stressed prepausal \/r\/ were found (14 were instances\nof pejorative use of the word queer). Eight tokens contained bunched \/r\/, five\ncontained tip-up \/r\/ and five were rless (i.e. with no clear \/r\/ gesture). The\noccurrence of bunched \/r\/ in word-list speech style is therefore not anomalous\nfor this speaker, but he makes more use of the bunched variant in the more\nformal speech style. In conversational recording, this speaker often used Scots\npronunciations and lexis typical of working-class speech in the Scottish Central\nBelt e.g. daein \u2018doing\u2019, oot \u2018out\u2019, the day \u2018today\u2019, fitball \u2018football\u2019 and therefore is\nunlikely to have been miscategorised in this socio-economic group. Only one\nother WC male used a front bunched variant, LM16 (once in the word beer).\nBased on data from the UTI corpora we have collected to date and informal\nobservation in the field, bunched \/r\/ is rare amongmale working-class speakers.\nIt is unclear at this time why this speaker uses a bunched \/r\/ variant in word-list\nand spontaneous speech style as we do not have detailed information on this\nC\u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011\nSOCIAL STRATIFICATION OF TONGUE SHAPE 265\nspeaker\u2019s background, or on the general differences in \/r\/ production which\nword-list vs. spontaneous speech style might cause.\nAnother interesting finding was that the MC tongue configurations in\narticulations of prepausal \/r\/ are clearly neither alveolar nor retroflex\napproximants, as has been previously assumed (Romaine 1979; Speitel and\nJohnston 1983; Stuart-Smith 1999). What this study shows are tongue\nconfigurations closer to Delattre and Freeman\u2019s American types 4 and 6 \u2013\nrespectively \u2018dorsal bunched with dip\u2019 and \u2018fronted bunched\u2019 (Delattre and\nFreeman 1968: 41, 44), the former of which they identified as producing the\n\u2018strongest auditory impression\u2019 of \/r\/ (Delattre and Freeman 1968: 64) in our\ncorpus.\n4.3 Auditory-articulatory correlation\nAlthough the auditory analysis was more fine-grained than the articulatory\nanalysis, a one-tailed Spearman\u2019s correlation test showed that there was a\nstrong positive correlation between tongue configuration classification and the\nauditory variant classification: r = 0.637 N = 136 p < 0.001. This significant\ncorrelation would appear to confirm that bunched articulations are associated\nwith a stronger auditory rhotic effect in comparison with other variants.\n5. DISCUSSION\nOur initial auditory identification of a socially-stratified continuum of weaker\n(WC) to stronger (MC) auditory variants of postvocalic \/r\/ was backed up by the\nultrasound investigation. Quantitative analysis of tongue configurations also\nshowedacontinuumfromWCboys tending toproduce \/r\/mainlywithcanonical\ntip up and front up tongue configurations to MC girls always using bunched\ntongue configurations. Thus, we find working- and middle-class speakers in the\neastern Central Belt of Scotland using both tongue configuration and gesture\ntiming in order to produce auditory variants of \/r\/ at opposite ends of the rhotic\nspectrum.This socioarticulatorypolarization forpostvocalic \/r\/ is consistentwith\nthemarked sociolinguistic polarization found in auditory data for postvocalic \/r\/\nand seven other consonantal variables in Glasgow, in western central Scotland\n(Stuart-Smith et al. 2007).\nThe indexicality of these different articulatory variants reaches beyond the \/r\/\nitself, causing the vowel systems of these sociolects to diverge. It is likely that\nbunched \/r\/ is responsible for the neutralization of \/i\/ \/\u03b5\/ and \/\u00d8\/ to [\u0259\/\u0002] before\n\/r\/ e.g. fir, fur, fern [f \u00ae], [f\u00d8\u00ae], [f\u03b5\u00aen] to [f\u0002], [f\u0002], [f\u0002n] (Aitken 1979: 111), which\nis typical of MC Scottish speech, and is untypical of WC speech. (Compare the\nprerhotic vocalic tongue body postures of words ending in \/ar\/ in Figure 1).\nSimilar articulatory variants of \/r\/ were identified in American English in\nDelattre and Freeman\u2019s cineradiographic study (Delattre and Freeman 1968).\nDelattre and Freeman suggested that alternation between bunched and retroflex\nC\u00a9 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2011\n266 LAWSON ET AL.\n\/r\/ had no acoustic consequence, so long as strictures were equally extreme\n(Delattre and Freeman 1968: 53, 54), making a social-indexical use of tongue\nshape unlikely. Subsequent research of American English postvocalic \/r\/ has\nsuggested that variation between retroflex and bunched variants is speaker-\nspecific and idiosyncratic (Mielke, Baker andArchangeli 2007) and that speakers\nare only \u2018weakly aware\u2019 of these articulatory variants (Twist et al. 2007: 215),\nwhich again implies that these articulatory variants are unlikely to become\nsocially indexical. The results of the present socioarticulatory study suggest that\nthis systemisation of \/r\/ is contingent, and can be otherwise. In Scottish English,\nsuch articulatory variation is in some way perceptible and can be exploited by\nspeakers to index socio-economic class, a findingwhich shedsmore light on both\nScottish and American systems of variation.\nThe identification of socially-stratified articulatory variants of postvocalic \/r\/\nin our corpus shows that an audio\/acoustic approach to the analysis of variation\ndoes not capture the full picture.With the advent of ultrasound tongue imaging,\na more integrated approach to variation is possible which can begin to help\naddress the fundamental question of how articulatory variation is transmitted\nfrom speaker to hearer.\nNOTES\n1.

Note that although we have added IPA symbols for each category here, it was\nnot possible to use IPA symbols in the Praat MFC experiment. Derhoticised \/r\/ is\nparticularly difficult to represent using segmental IPA transcription as it is a variant\nthat arises due to gestural asymmetry in the syllable coda; vowel retraction and\npharyngealisation contribute to the perception of weak rfulness, but are not the only\nacoustic cues for derhoticised \/r\/. The onset of delayed tongue-tip raising before the\noffset of voicingmeans that formant transitions are oftenweakly audible either during\nthe final cycles of voicing or in breath after the offset of voicing.\n4. Only three British informants took part in Delattre and Freeman\u2019s study; they were\nall nonrhotic speakers from Liverpool and only onset \/r\/ was studied.\nREFERENCES\nAitken, Adam J. 1979.
