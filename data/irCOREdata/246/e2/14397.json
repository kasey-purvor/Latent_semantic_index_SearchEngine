It goes against the\ngrain of current material values. But it really is consistent with what I believe is the best\nabout MIT. It is innovative. It expresses our belief in the way education can be advanced\u2014\nby constantly widening access to information and by inspiring others to participate.\n(Charles M. Vest, President Emiritus, MIT, September 2001)\nMIT\u2019s announcement to the world in April 2001, that it would be posting the content\nof some 2,000 MIT courses on the Web, is certainly a visible and voluble signal of the\nInstitute\u2019s intent to extend technology-enabled opportunities to expand educational\naccess and quality. No educational institution has ever proposed anything as revolu-\ntionary, or as daunting.\n*Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 211 Massachusetts Avenue, Room N42\u2013253, Cambridge,\nMA, USA. Email: vkumar@MIT.EDU\n242 M. S. Vijay Kumar\nThe idea behind MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) (http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/oki) is to\nmake course materials that are used in the teaching of almost all undergraduate and\ngraduate subjects at MIT available on the Web free of charge, to any user anywhere\nin the world. OCW is a large-scale, Web-based electronic publishing initiative funded\njointly by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foun-\ndation and MIT. Its goals are: \n1. to provide free, searchable, coherent access to MIT\u2019s course materials for educa-\ntors in the non-profit sector, students and individual learners around the world;\nand\n2. to create an efficient, standards-based model that other universities may emulate\nto publish their own course materials. Extensive metadata tagging, launching a\ncomprehensive ongoing evaluation process, developing and enhancing our\ncontent management and publishing technologies, and evolving our internal\nstaffing and workflow are important elements of this process.\nMIT OCW will advance technology-enhanced education at MIT, and will serve as\na model for university dissemination of knowledge in the Internet age. This venture\ncontinues the tradition at MIT of open dissemination of educational materials,\nphilosophy and modes of thought, and will help lead to fundamental changes in the\nway colleges and universities utilize the Internet as a vehicle for education (Diamond,\n2003). According to Miyagawa, an MIT professor of linguistics, \u2018OCW reflects the\nidea that, as scholars and teachers, we wish to share freely the knowledge we generate\nthrough our research and teaching\u2019. He goes on to state that \u2018While MIT may be\nbetter known for our research, with OCW, we wish to showcase the quality of our\nteaching\u2019.\nAs of June 2005, 1,100 courses in areas ranging from Computer Science to Polit-\nical Science have been published. The positive reaction and global impact of the\ninitiative is evidenced through the extensive visits to the OCW site from people in\ncountries across the world and also the comments on the value of the materials\n(http:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/OcwWeb\/Global\/AboutOCW\/worldreaction.htm).\nWhile MIT\u2019s initial efforts focused on meeting the original publishing target, it has\nalso looked at ways to extend OCW\u2019s reach through exploring translation efforts\n(such as Spanish), through tools to facilitate the use and through the engagement of\nlike-minded institutions.\nOCW has important implications for meeting the needs of education beyond\nproviding extensive access to course content. OCW presents a snapshot of the trans-\nactions in a course\u2014the lectures, assignments, and discussions, along with the struc-\ntural relationship between these entities\u2014thereby providing a view of the practices\nand pedagogies employed, and hence a useful model for educators everywhere.\nWhile OCW has been the keynote, it has not been an isolated event in MIT\u2019s\nagenda to employ technology for educational transformation. Projects, such as those\nsupported by the I-Campus initiative (an alliance between MIT and Microsoft\nResearch) as well as the MIT Council on Educational Technology (MITCET), have\nled to innovations for developing content, tools and pedagogy with the potential to\nFrom open resources to educational opportunity 243\nsignificantly impact the form and function of educational practice. The following\nexamples illustrate this.\nTransforming field studies\nMIT students from the Environmental Studies programme have been traveling in\nAustralia and New Zealand collecting data from soil and water samples through envi-\nronmental and geo-positional sensors, storing the data, making computations in the\nfield based on the data, and displaying the data. This group of students was part of\nthe ENVIT project at MIT, whose goal was to create Mobile Field Data Collection\nSoftware for the Environmental Professional. The central piece of technology\nemployed here is a Personal Digital Assistant integrated with other hardware and soft-\nware modified for mobility; namely, Teletype GPS sensors, Hydrolab multi-parame-\nter water quality probes, ESRI ArcPad Mobil GIS and Windows CE development\nusing embedded Visual Basic, C++ and Access. This innovation has moved field\nsampling and measurements (still largely dependent upon pencil-and-paper field\nnotebooks) to a new level of accuracy and efficiency. It has wonderful implications for\nmobile learners, field engineers and scientists who have hitherto lacked the appropri-\nate technology to carry out their work in an efficient manner.\niLab\u2014first-hand experience over the Internet\nOver the past two years, students at globally distributed locations such as institutions\nin Singapore, which are part of MIT\u2019s Singapore MIT Alliance programme, as well as\nSweden among others, were able to use laboratory equipment located at MIT. Specif-\nically, these students used network analyzer equipment employed in microelectronics\ncourses for various experiments, such as measuring characterizations of transistors.\nThe iLab project (http:\/\/swiss.csail.mit.edu\/projects\/icampus\/projects\/ilab.html)\nthat makes this possible enables access to these instruments through a Web interface.\nThrough iLab it is possible to deliver hands-on experimentation to students\nanywhere, at anytime. In addition to Microelectronics, laboratories and experimental\nset-ups that are being Web-enabled include Reactors for Polymerization, Heat\nExchangers and Shake Tables for seismic measurements. The iLab ambition is to\ncreate the framework to extend access beyond these specific experiments to a variety\nof remote, geographically dispersed laboratories.\nEducational value\nA significant characteristic of the technological innovations described here is that they\nsupport active learning and first-hand experience, both important elements of the\nMIT\u2019s educational programmes, in flexible, location-independent and contextually\nrelevant ways that add richness to the learning experience. Another notable example\nof promoting active learning is Technology Enabled Active Learning, which involves\ntransforming large lecture courses to active, collaborative studio-based learning for\nphysics.\n244 M. S. Vijay Kumar\nAn important educational characteristic of these technological innovations is also\nthat they induce important proximities between learners, their peers and instructors\nas well as the community. The net result is an increased interaction of the learner with\nthe content, context and community.\nThe educational promise and strategic underpinnings\nThe promise of new technologies in terms of new pedagogy, abundant content and\nnew clientele for education are numerous and seductive. However, understanding\nand exploiting these opportunities requires educational institutions to have a \u2018strate-\ngic focus\u2019; that is, they should select a limited set of opportunities to explore and\nshould pursue those opportunities in depth. Institutions must identify specific targets\nof opportunity and need and particular areas of intrinsic value and potential unique-\nness (Kumar, 2000).\nMIT\u2019S approach leading to the launch of these innovations reflects (at least in hind-\nsight) such a strategic focus. Starting in 1999, the MITCET undertook a six-month\nstudy looking at how MIT should respond to the opportunity presented by emerging\ntechnology; in particular, the Internet. The visioning exercise led to a variety of poten-\ntial scenarios of how MIT could position itself. The starting point of this exercise was\na reflection on and articulation of the unique aspects of the MIT educational experi-\nence, to answer the question: \u2018What is MIT\u2019s educational value proposition?\u2019 The\nMITCET identified that a central dimension of MIT\u2019s educational value was the high\nbandwidth of interaction between excellent students and excellent faculty. Another\nwas the importance of first-hand experience in the educational process. MIT\u2019s educa-\ntional technology strategy therefore was to launch experiments to: understand how\ninformation technology could amplify these value dimensions, extend it to other\ncommunities not typically served by MIT, and address existing obstacles to achieving\nthis value in current practice. MIT\u2019s educational technology initiatives over the past\nfew years reflect this strategy and address the inherent opportunities and challenges.\nThe OCW idea, that the best way to advance MIT\u2019s fundamental mission and exploit\nthe Internet would be to put all MIT\u2019s course materials on the Web, open to everyone,\nand free, was, in retrospect, a logical conclusion to this strategic exercise.\nBoth iLabs, which builds on the values of hands-on experience in MIT education,\nand Technology Enabled Active Learning, which addresses the problem of large\nlectures through studio-based learning in small collaborative groups, also reflect how\nthe educational technology strategy was in alignment with the educational value\nproposition. The strategizing exercise by the MITCET set the stage for a series of\nlarge-scale educational experiments to promote innovative teaching and learning, as\nwell as for the creation of an educational commons.\nInfrastructure for sustainability\nImportant infrastructure initiatives were also launched with a view to enabling\nthe sustainable implementation of these educational programmes, through building\nFrom open resources to educational opportunity 245\ntechnology platforms and facilities as well as through strengthening organizational\ncapacity and alignment. In the area of building technology platforms, three initiatives\nare important to mention in the context of this discussion: Stellar, MIT\u2019s Course\nManagement System; dSpace, a project to develop a digital repository for educational\nmaterials; and the Open Knowledge Initiative (OKI), for developing an open archi-\ntecture to support the portability and sustainability of educational applications and\ntheir easily integration into campus infrastructures. The long-term goals of these\ninfrastructure efforts are to link the MIT community worldwide, and to provide easy\naccess to the full range of MIT\u2019s intellectual life and resources (library materials,\nresearch facilities, colloquia, etc.). MIT\u2019s infrastructure will make it easy to commu-\nnicate, follow coursework and collaborate online.\nPorting, sharing and integration through the OKI\nThe OKI provides educational projects with a general framework that allows technol-\nogy innovation to be safely incorporated into live learning environments. Innovators\u2019\nwork can also be easily shared with users and developers at other institutions that\nsupport the OKI framework. For instance, OKI will enable MIT, the University of\nMichigan and Indiana University to offer leverage to their development efforts to\nshare tool and applications in the evolution of their collaborative Sakai platform\n(www.sakaiproject.edu). It will also enable institutions to provide a rich suite of\neducational functionality such as for assessment and concept mapping as well as for\nsearching and presenting image collections. The Visual Understanding Environment\n(http:\/\/vue.tccs.tufts.edu\/) project at Tufts University and the Narravision application\nbeing developed at MIT, to support the Visualizing Cultures class course, are exam-\nples. These tools use software provided by the OKI that allows several repositories to\nbe accessed simultaneously and offer leverages to the local institute\u2019s infrastructure.\nOKI enables research and development efforts to concentrate on core functionality,\nrather than spending time and money building simulated environments or managing\ncomplex system integrations.\nSo how does OKI do this? OKI started with a somewhat modest ambition: to\ndevelop extensible and customizable applications that provide Learning Management\nSystems functionality. Early in the project, its leaders recognized that open, extensible\nand clearly defined architectural specifications are critical to realizing this ambition,\nas well as for other educational applications. The interface methods defined by OKI\nsupport the ongoing integration of three general categories of software: \n\u25cf Learning applications ranging from individual quizzing, authoring and collabora-\ntion tools to suites of such tools that include course management and learning\nmanagement capabilities.\n\u25cf Central administrative systems such as student information, human resources and\ndirectory management.\n\u25cf Academic systems including library information systems and digital repositories of\nresearch and educational materials.\n246 M. S. Vijay Kumar\nAt the time of launching OKI we observed that while existing learning management\nsystems were serving a very important function, in that they had created a very low\nbarrier to entry for universities mounting course materials, they presented a high\nbarrier to exit. Technical design aspects limited the portability and interoperability of\nlearning resources and consequently inhibited the kind of flexibility that leads to\ngreater use and sharing of learning materials. For example, the tight coupling of the\nuser interface to learning components (as in a monolithic learning system) constrains\nthe ability for resources to be used in different educational settings and contexts. Typi-\ncally the solutions available were unsuitable because they were all-in-one packages\nwith components offering a single level of functionality designed for widespread use.\nOKI embraces a component-based approach that relies on loose, lightweight, but\nwell-defined contracts to enable links to common infrastructure services. OKI\nprovides specifications for interfaces among components of a learning technology\nenvironment. The intent is to make it easier for campus and commercial developers\nto produce software that will work in a range of higher education infrastructures to\nsatisfy diverse educational needs. By providing a stable, scalable base that supports\nthe flexibility needed by higher education, OKI offers an approach that may help us\nto produce and share high-quality courseware and to construct enterprise applica-\ntions more cost-effectively and more efficiently, as learning technology is increasingly\nintegrated into the education process.\nThe OKI has produced and made available as Open Source, a series of Open\nService Interface Definitions informed by a broad architectural view of the educa-\ntional technology landscape (http:\/\/www.okiproject.org).\nOKI\u2019s work in the educational systems is by no means the first. Initial work in the\ninteroperability area such as that of the IMS Global Consortium led to some common\ndefinitions and standards for data interchange (Sharable Content Object Reference\nModel). These are useful for copying content from one system to another. They\nprimarily address the encoding of data for exchange among cooperating systems and\naddress issues such as metadata and learning design that address the semantics of\nlearning content. However, to get more complete real-time integration, service\nspecifications are required in addition to data specifications.\nOKI is still only a step in the path of component-based approaches to design and\nthe evolution of global specifications and standards, crucial for advancing the use and\ninteroperability of learning resources.\nOKI\u2019s Open Service Interface Definitions are available in open source mode to\nfacilitate the large-scale adoption of this architectural model. This will allow institu-\ntions to easily take advantage of new technology and new learning management\ncomponents as they become available. It will also allow components to be updated\nindividually without destabilizing the overall environment.\nThe end game: ecology of open educational opportunity\nMIT\u2019s approach for developing its educational technology strategy urges careful\nconsideration of the core values of an institution and reflection of its value proposition.\nFrom open resources to educational opportunity 247\nSustainability has been a key theme in MIT\u2019s efforts, and ensuring alignment with\ninstitutional and educational values was seen as a necessary first-step in this direction.\nSelecting a limited set of educational experiments was an important aspect of our\nefforts, as was designing an infrastructure to enable the success and durability of these\nexperiments. Our efforts toward this end had to also take into account some \u2018givens\u2019\nof the educational ecosystem: \n\u25cf Educational value is derived in multiple ways and modalities, requiring a hetero-\ngeneous set of tools.\n\u25cf The technologies on which we build our infrastructure will necessarily change.\n\u25cf The implementation of educational applications of scale and substance requires\nintegration with the existing infrastructure and enterprise.\nThe end goal is to be able to ensure that the quality educational content and tools\nthat are being created through innovative uses of technology at MIT elsewhere can\nindeed be leveraged to substantively impact educational opportunity and transforma-\ntion in its form and function.\nIn the period ahead we will be learning from the implementation of our efforts. The\nfeedback we receive about the dynamics of adoption including contextual consider-\nations will influence ongoing development of our initiatives and help deliver the\npromise of advancing learning through technology and progress in education.\nReferences\nDiamond, D.
