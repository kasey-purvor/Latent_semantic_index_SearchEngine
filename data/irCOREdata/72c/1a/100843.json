INTRODUCTION\nThe application of x-ray computed tomographic (CT)\ntechniques to nondestructive evaluation of materials, outside\nof the medical field for which they were initially developed,\nis a rapidly expanding area of research.1 The expensive body\nsized medical CT machines have been replaced by relatively\ninexpensive bench-top sets. The typical spatial resolutions of\n0.5 mm for medical systems have also been improved down\nto 5 mm for bench-top sets. These improvements are mainly\ndue to the advancement in pixellated x-ray detectors and the\nsimultaneous development of microfocus x-ray tubes. For\nexample, third generation (cone-beam geometry, single-\nsource, two-dimensional detector) medical CT systems use\n12 in. x-ray image intensifiers (detector pixel pitch of 0.5\nmm) and 1 mm focal-spot size x-ray tubes in a proximity\nfocused geometry. Compared to a modern non-destructive\nevaluation (NDE) CT set which often use flat-panel pixel-\nlated caesium iodide coated complementary metal oxide\nsemiconductor (CMOS) arrays (detector pixel pitch of\n50 mm) and x-ray tubes with a 5 mm focal-spot size in a\ngeometry which magnifies the sample on the detector. The\nuse of improved detectors has the additional benefit of better\ncontrast resolution and the signal digitization is higher (x-ray\nimage intensifiers are digitized to 8 bits, CMOS flat-panel\narrays are digitized to 12 bits). The use of NDE CT sets for\nuse in the study of nanopowder assemblies is only just com-\ning to fruition as the spatial and contrast resolutions are only\njust approaching the limits for which useful information can\nbe obtained.\nThe x-ray microtomography system at the University of\nSurrey is currently being used to examine several powder\nand particulate systems. There is particular interest in the\ndynamic evolution of particulate systems as they are sintered\nand, in particular, the physical properties of the system. The\nbulk-density, moisture content, interparticle spacing, and par-\nticle shape are all important parameters which affect the\nmacroscale bulk properties of the particle systems postsinter-\ning. It is this microscale particle system which is modeled in\ncomputational fluid dynamics simulations. There is currently\na missing link between the microscale structure of particles\nas they dynamically evolve during sintering and the way in\nwhich this affects the bulk properties. It is proposed to image\nthis microscale system using x-ray microtomography, reduce\nthe complexity of this raw 14-bit level data using geometri-\ncal reasoning, which can then be inputted into computational\nfluid dynamics simulations to ascertain the bulk properties,\nthus closing the information loop. The appearance of frac-\ntures and large pores in the green part (i.e., presintering) has\ndetrimental effects on its mechanical properties, such as\nyield strength and hardness, as well as in some cases affect-\ning thermal and electrical conductive properties. The current\nresearch is focused on a better understanding of the micro-\nstructural evolution of the particle assembly during a coupled\nuniaxial compaction\/drying process of wet particle clusters.\nII. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF X-RAY\nTOMOGRAPHIC IMAGING\nThe minimum attainable spatial resolution of a tomogra-\nphic projection acquired with an x-ray imaging system is\nlimited by four factors: the x-ray source size, the geometrical\nmagnification, the detector pixel size, and the detector ele-\nment pitch. The number of angular projections taken and the\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS VOLUME 96, NUMBER 5 1 SEPTEMBER 2004\n0021-8979\/2004\/96(5)\/2889\/6\/$22.00 \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics2889\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The accuracy of linear attenuation coefficients for\neach voxel calculated during the tomographic reconstruction\nis determined by the photon energies used during the acqui-\nsition of the projections.\nA. Image formation\nThe imaging system used in x-ray microtomography\nuses exactly the same geometrical principles as shadow im-\naging with an optical system with an extended source.2 The\nspatial resolution in the formed image is determined by ei-\nther the size of the extended source if high magnification is\nused, the detector pixel size if the sample is in close prox-\nimity to the detector, or more usually a combination of the\ntwo. It follows that at the two extremes it is either the ex-\ntended photon-source size or the detector sampling which\nlimit the spatial resolution. The smallest detector pixel sizes\nare obtained from a combination of charge-coupled devices\nwith a 7 mm pixel size coupled to an x ray to light convert-\ning screens, giving an effective pixel detector size of\n1\u20132 mm.3 In contrast the smallest extended-source size for\nthe formation of x rays is <400 nm.4 It is therefore logical to\nuse a spatially small extended-source target and a high mag-\nnification geometry, this also reduces the tolerances which\nneed to be placed on the detector pixel size of the detector.\nB. X-ray source size\nMost of the current microfocus x-ray (MFX) sources are\nbased on transmission targets. In contrast most medical and\nindustrial x-ray sources use a reflection target, the geometries\nfor reflection and transmission x-ray targets are shown in\nFig. 1.\nUsing the continuously slowing down approximation\n(CSDA) range for electrons in matter,5 the maximum range\nfor molybdenum and tungsten reflection targets can be plot-\nted against incoming electron energy, see Fig. 2.\nThe focal-spot size is highly dependent on energy in the\nreflection geometry. The transmission geometry reduces this\nrange at higher energies as mean free path of the electron is\ncomparable with the target thickness and multiple scatters\nare less likely to occur.\nMonte Carlo simulations were conducted using the\nGEANT v4.6.0 radiation transportation code.6 The typical\nthickness of a transmission target in current commercial sys-\ntems is <4 mm. Thus, the geometry was defined as a 4 mm\nthickness of target material with the electron source normal\nto surface boundary. A range of electron energies from\n20 keV to 80 keV were projected into the target in a pencil\nbeam of d width. The distance from the input axis were\nrecorded in intensity versus radial distance from the electron\ninput point on the exit face of the target. The full width at\nhalf maximum of the scattering ranges for electrons in a\n4 mm molybdenum target for different energies are shown in\nFig. 3.\nThe electron spread from the Monte Carlo data shows\nthe full width at half maximum scattering range for electrons\nin a 4 mm thick transmission molybdenum target is about\n122 nm and is energy independent. This shows it is not elec-\ntron scattering within the target which is limiting focal-spot\nsize (cf. reflection targets) but it is more likely to be space-\ncharge repulsion effects in the incoming electron beam used\nto generate a sufficient flux of x rays, which limits the mini-\nmum focal-spot size.\nC. Geometrical magnification\nThe finite size of the x-ray source size limits the ultimate\nspatial resolution of an imaging system.2 The unsharpness Ug\nassociated with the focal spot of size a is dependent on the\nmagnification m:\nUg = as1 \u2212 1\/md . s1d\nThe detector pixel size F also introduces receptor unsharp-\nness Ur which when combined in quadrature with Ug deter-\nmines the overall unsharpness U.

It follows that\nmo = 1 + scF\/ad2, s2d\nwhere c is a constant introduced to correct for the shape of\nthe x-ray source, for a Gaussian source c=0.72. The opti-\nmum magnification is plotted against energy determined\nfrom the focal-spot size for a reflection molybdenum target\nfor detector pixel sizes of 50 mm, 100 mm, and 200 mm, see\nFig. 4.\nFor transmission microfocal x-ray tubes, as the focal-\nspot size is not so dependent on the incoming electron en-\nergy, any energy will produce optimum images and it is the\nsource to sample and sample to detector distances that need\nto be considered.\nD. Modulation transfer function\nThe modulation transfer function (MTF) can be deter-\nmined by taking the modulus of the square of the imaging\nsystem transfer function (ISTF). The ISTF as a function of\nspatial frequency is dependent on the x-ray source size, the\ndetector pixel size, and the image magnification. For a source\nwith a Gaussian distribution and a detector consisting of\nmany square elements, the MTF of the system is a product of\na Gaussian (from the source) and a sinc function (from the\ndetector elements):\nMTFxsjd = u\u0084hsinsp a j txd\/sp a j txdj\n3expf\u2212 phs1 \u2212 ad2j2rf\n2jg\u00852u , s3d\nwhere j is the spatial frequency, rf is the source radius, tx is\nthe detector pixel size, and a is the reciprocal geometric\nmagnification. The ISTF for a detector with a pixel size of\n50 mm is plotted for magnifications of 5, 10, and 20 and a\nsource radius of 5 mm is shown in Fig. 5. For magnifications\ngreater than 10 there is still power in the image signal at a\nresolution of 200 line-pairs\/mm s,5 mmd, indicated by the\npositive magnitude of the ISTF. Changing the focal-spot size\nof the source will have virtually no effect on the MFT as it is\nthe detector pixel size which band limits the measured im-\nage.\nE. Angular sampling requirements\nThe number of projections needed to adequately sample\nFourier space is given by the Nyquist sampling theorem7 for\nan object diameter D with detector pixel size t. The number\nof projections needed to satisfy this is given by Eq. (4):\nNf = pD\/2t . s4d\nThe mechanical movement of the sample must be accurate to\nthe precision required by the Nyquist sampling theorem.\nF. Photon energies\nThe photon energies used to acquire projections have an\neffect on the accuracy of the calculation of linear attenuation\ncoefficients in the reconstructed voxels.8 By combining the\nrelationship for the noise propagated in an image [Eq. (5)]\nwith an expression for the total run time [Eq. (6)], the accu-\nracy of the measured attenuation coefficients can be calcu-\nlated [Eq. (7)]. Dm is the noise propagated in an image due to\nthe finite photon count n per ray sum for filtered back pro-\njection. T is the total run time for a complete tomographic\nacquisition:\nDm = ks2p\/nDtd1\/2, s5d\nT = 8pnN4 sinhsmDd\/mDA8, s6d\nDm\/m = 4pkN2hfD sinhsmDdg\/ftTA \u2019 smDd3gj1\/2, s7d\nwhere k is a factor dependent on the digital filter used for\nback projection (e.g., k=0.289 for a Ramachandran-\nLakshminarayanan filter), D is the object diameter, t the de-\ntector pixel size, N is the number of detector elements, m the\nlinear attenuation coefficient, and A8 is the photon-source\nintensity. If all the geometrical factors, the total run time, and\nthe source intensity are fixed, the accuracy depends on the\n\u201csensitivity factor\u201d f(sinhsmDd \/ smDd)3g1\/2 as shown in\nFig. 6.\nThe optimum energy of the x-ray source can be deter-\nmined from the sensitivity factor given by Eq. (7). The pri-\nmary component of the image for our example is spherical\nparticles of aluminum oxide particles close packed (Al2O3,\nwith an equivalent density of 2.05 g cm\u22123).

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nthe energy range from 0 to 80 keV can be determined by\nXCOM.9 This is then related to the MFP length in the par-\nticle assembly and plotted in Fig. 7.\nThe optimum energy for an assembly of close packed\nspherical particles of aluminum oxide with a diameter of\n20 mm is therefore between 16 keV and 27 keV but opti-\nmum at 19 keV. Molybdenum has a Ka characteristic peak at\n17.5 keV which is close to the optimum energy compared to\ntungsten at 59.3 keV (the usual choice of target material for\na microfocus x ray). Hence a molybdenum target x-ray tube\nwas filtered with 100 mm of zirconium to give the quasimo-\nnoenergetic spectrum shown in Fig. 8.\nMonochromating the source has two useful effects. The\ndose is minimized as only radiation with an energy opti-\nmized for imaging passes through the sample. Beam harden-\ning artefact associated with reconstructions from polychro-\nmatically illuminated projections is also eliminated.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS\nFigure 9 shows the experimental apparatus used for\nhigh-resolution x-ray CT. The detector is a Hamamatsu\nC7942 flat-panel CMOS array (240032400 pixels at a\n50 mm pixel pitch with a CsI coating) and a Hamamatsu\nL6731-01 microfocus x-ray tube (Mo target 80 kVp,\n100 mA, 5 mm focal-spot size). The sample stage is a com-\nputer controlled rotational stepper motor with a resolution of\n0.01\u00b0. The ring artefact commonly associated with third gen-\neration scanners (caused by the repeated use of the same\ndetector elements in each projection) is minimized by me-\nchanically translating the detector sidewards by a random\ninteger number of pixels for each projection. The sample is\nrotated through 360\u00b0 in a number of steps determined by the\nNyquist sampling theorem (typically, number of steps\n=p \/23 number of detector elements). The projection data\nare then stored and at a later stage reconstructed using a\nFeldkamp based three-dimensional back-projection routine10\non the Beowulf parallel-processing cluster into a three-\ndimensional data set of the linear attenuation coefficients.\nThis can then be processed using a variety of signal-\nprocessing methods to extract useful information from the\ndata.\nThe two-dimensional projection 14-bit level data are col-\nlected on a 20483204832048 pixellated detector therefore\nproducing a three-dimensional data set of 204832048\n32048 voxels (thus a 10310310 mm3 sample can be im-\naged at 5 mm). If the reconstruction data are stored as\ndouble-precision data to preserve the accuracy of the data,\nthe data storage size is 68 gigabytes. It is therefore essential\nto reduce this raw data in a geometrical reasonable way in\norder to view and perform numerical calculations pertaining\nto its properties. This is even more important if the particles\nare to be dynamically tracked as the particle system evolves\nduring sintering. Multiple 68 gigabytes data sets of raw data\nwould be virtually impossible to resolve dynamically, but a\nsimple description of individual particles and their properties\nwould reduce the problem to a manageable task.\nThe normal rotational stage can be replaced by a beryl-\nlium or carbon fibre windowed environmental chamber,\nFIG. 7.

The samples can then be heated (up to\n1000 K) and compressed (up to 6 kPa) under partial pressure\n(1 atm to below 10\u22126 mbar).\nApplications\nX-ray microtomography is an ideal tool for imaging na-\nnopowder assemblies but does not have the resolution to\nimage individual nanoparticles. Nevertheless the harvesting\nof large nanoparticles s,500 nmd from colloidal suspensions\nis possible.11 The formation of the assembly can be studied\nas the suspension medium is evaporated and information re-\ngarding the packing density and large area defects can be\nobtained. The samples can then be mechanically tested and\ndesirable properties can be linked to the formation and struc-\nture of the final assembly. The drying process can then be\nadapted allowing the evolution of better harvesting tech-\nniques.\nThe formation of vacuum sintered nanoparticle assem-\nblies can also be studied and refined using the vacuum-\nfurnace rotation stage. The sintered regime can be carefully\ncontrolled and the effects of heating cycles, axial loading\nimpulses, and vacuum conditions can all be assessed against\ndesirable mechanical properties.\nThe formation of nanoparticles assemblies has a particu-\nlar application in the pharmaceutical industry. The formation\nof cold-pressed pills from powder assemblies can result in\nundesirable mechanical properties. If the compaction of the\npowder is too low the pill may not be stable during transport.\nIf the compaction is too high the pill may not release the\ndrug in the body in the most effective way. Irregularities in\nthe internal structure of the pill therefore need to be linked to\nmanufacturing conditions. Figure 11 shows x-ray CT data\ntaken of a Sterwin Medicines Codydramol pill.\nIf a pharmaceutical nanoparticle assembly is encapsu-\nlated and the powder is not cold pressed, then the way in\nwhich it settles during transport can affect the drug delivery\nsystem. Figure 12 shows x-ray CT data taken of a generic\nloperamide hydrochloride capsule. The fissures and packing\ndensity of the powder can be seen.\nFigure 13 shows x-ray CT data from a breakfast cereal.\nThe figure shows a three-dimensional isosurface render of\nthe outside of the cereal and the inner air voids. The number\nof voids and their size was determined with a three-\ndimensional void labeling algorithm written using IDL v6.0\n(Research Systems Inc., Boulder, CO).12 The ability to ex-\ntract information with x-ray microtomography, which is per-\ntinent to engineering process control, is an important feed-\nback mechanism for the development of more efficient and\neconomic manufacturing processes.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe use of x-ray microtomography has an important role\nto play in the analysis of nanoparticle assemblies as it pro-\nvides three-dimensional data necessary to understand how\nsuch assemblies evolve during processing. It has been shown\nthat an x-ray microtomography system optimized from both\nspatial and contrast resolution produces high-quality infor-\nFIG. 10.
