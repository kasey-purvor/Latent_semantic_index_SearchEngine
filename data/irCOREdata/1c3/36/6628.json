(Strassman, 1984)\nMy first encounter with computer-based learning was in 1975 when I trialled packages\nproduced by the Chelsea Science Simulation Project while on teaching practice. Access to\nthe minicomputer running the packages was via modem and teletype, and response times\nwere measured in minutes rather than seconds. Three of the four packages were little more\nthan computer-based lookup tables but the fourth, despite the severe limitations of the\ntechnology, inspired me to take computers seriously as tools for learning. The application\nwas a simulation of crossing different strains of fruit fly, a technique beloved of geneticists\nbut impractical for school biology. I was impressed by the use of a computer to achieve\nsomething highly educational that was impractical by any other means.\nThere have been many significant advances in computing since 1975: the advent of the\neight-bit microcomputer, hypertext, graphical user interfaces, object technology, CD-\nROMs, the Internet and the World Wide Web. Prophets of what the latest technological\ndevelopments will achieve for education have been many, and by and large false. Progress\nin the short term has appeared painfully slow. Pioneers have felt hurt by the failure of their\ncolleagues to embrace the computer-based learning materials they have worked so hard to\nperfect, but perhaps they failed to recognize the extent to which they had embedded their\nown idiosyncratic approach to teaching into their products.\nThe Association for Learning Technology was founded by a group who believed that the\nlong-term consequences of technology applied to education would be profound. They were\nkeen to create a forum for learning technology practitioners as a way of identifying and\nsharing good practice. The annual ALT conference has reflected a growing maturity among\nboth technologists and teachers as they gain insight through shared experiences.\n2\nAa-J Volume 7 Number I\nThe theme of the fifth ALT conference, Lifelong learning on a connected planet, was a\nchallenge to delegates to think through the implications for education of a connected\nplanet; one where all points on the global Internet are equally accessible to all other points.\nFive years ago the concept of the online course did not exist. Now it is coming to be seen as\nthe growth sector for tertiary education. Many new online courses are conventional courses\nthat have been 'ported' to the new medium. If it is done well the pedagogic qualities that\nmade it a sound conventional course will also benefit the online version, but many\ninappropriate assumptions will also have been carried over. To be as good as, or better\nthan, an equivalent conventional course, an online course needs to be rebuilt from the\nground up. The course needs to integrate student interactions with the materials, with\ntutors and with fellow students, and the learning environment has to be flexible enough to\nrecognize and support a diversity of student needs. The same fundamental pedagogic\nprinciples apply to all types of course but the peculiar strengths and weaknesses of the\nInternet as a delivery and support medium require a wholesale reassessment of teaching\nmethods.\nA consensus on effective online education has yet to emerge. In this journal you will find\ndocumented a rich vein of innovation, experimentation and research. There is imagination\naplenty. Not all approaches will prove to be successful but all are helping, to develop a\nbetter understanding of how to use technology to create more and better educational\nopportunities for more people.\nReference\nStrassman, P. (1984), Information Payoff, Cambridge Mass: MIT Press.\nJonathan Darby\nLearning technology is inherently eclectic. Professionals from many areas are involved:\nmanagers, courseware developers, teachers in universities and schools, trainers in industry,\nand, of course, learners. The range of the papers presented at ALT-C98 bears witness to this\ndiversity, and to the way in which the ALT membership represents the UK learning\ntechnology constituency. Likewise the papers in this special issue reflect the diversity of\nthis constituency, with papers on the management and implementation of learning\ntechnology, discussions of the future role and impact of learning technology and reports of\nresearch studies. I think it is essential that ALT-J continues to publish high-quality papers in\nthese areas. The founding editor, Gabriel Jacobs, has established an excellent foundation\nfor developing the journal's profile in all three areas. With Grainne Conole's help I look\nforward to working with you to continue this development.\nDavid Squires\n3\n"}
