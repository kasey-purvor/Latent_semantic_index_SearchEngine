INTRODUCTION \n \nOver the past few years novel observing techniques have \nbeen developed exploiting fully polarimetric and \ninterferometric capabilities of which polarimetric SAR \ninterferometry (PolInSAR) is the most prominent [1]. It \nexploits the polarisation dependence of scattering mechanisms \nto estimate scattering phase centre heights, which can be \nextrapolated to retrieve plant height. However, no \ncomprehensive assessment of the operational potential and \nlimitations of PolInSAR are yet available. Particular open \nquestions relate to the conditions under which PolInSAR \nproduces accurate results, with respect to: \n i) structural canopy types \nii) technical sensor specifications \niii) imaging conditions (spatial and temporal).  \nTo help answer these questions, it is proposed to utilise the \nUK\u2019s Ground-Based SAR (GB-SAR) Outdoor System [2] in a \ncampaign of well controlled and coordinated experiments on \nvegetation canopies. The deployed system is shown in Fig. 1. \nCurrently, the portable system provides fully-polarimetric L- \nthrough X-band high-resolution SAR imagery, and is to be \nupgraded to provide the necessary interferometric capability. \nThe RF sub-system is based around a stepped-frequency CW \nradar system, which provides great flexibility in the equivalent \ntime-domain waveforms that can be realized. However, the \nmeasurement process is slow in relation to pulsed systems as \nthe aperture is built up by the mechanical scanning of the \npolarimetric antenna head at ~\u03bb\/4 increments across the 4m \naperture. At each measurement position, the response of the \ntarget to a series of discrete frequencies stepped over a \nprescribed bandwidth is measured. The total imaging time is \ndependent upon the radar frequency in use, but is of the order \nof several minutes.  Polarimetric scans are built up by repeat \nscans with the appropriate antennas switched in. \nThe PolInSAR technique requires high coherence between \ninterferometric image pairs, and the long data acquisition \ntimes raise the question of significant temporal decorrelation \ndue to wind disturbance of the canopy. This paper analyses the \nsignificance of consequences of target motion with respect to \nthe suitability of ground-based measurements for PolInSAR \ninvestigation. \n \nFigure 1. The deployed GB-SAR Outdoor System.  \n1105\n0-7803-9050-4\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE. 1105\nII.     PHYSICS-BASED SAR IMAGE SIMULATION \n \nA.. Coherent Modeling Strategy \nAs with any radar calculation we require a suitable \ndescription of the target. The techniques used to generate the \nmodel wheat canopy are described fully in [3]. Our wheat \ncanopy consists of a distribution of wheat plants each modeled \nas a cluster of curved stems, with ears and leaves (curved and \ntwisted strips) attached. We model a mature wheat canopy, \npost-heading with approximately 500 stems per square meter \n(Fig. 2). The model is based on field-collected physiological \nmeasurements [4,5,6,7]. \nThe simulation is physics-based, using the distorted-Born \napproximation, and accounting for canopy inhomogeneity. \nThe output of the simulation is simulated, coherent, fully \npolarimetric, single-look-complex SAR imagery, described in \n[3], and references therein. \n \nB. Effects of Crop Motion on Coherence \nDuring GB-SAR data acquisition crop motion influences \nthe final coherence image in two ways: during aperture \nformation, and between aperture formation. The effects of \nscatterer motion during aperture formation are discussed in the \nfollowing section. Here we consider the effects of inter-\naperture displacements and assume, for the present, that intra-\naperture displacements have little effect other than to broaden \nthe point spread function. \nClutter motion has been modeled by varying the curvature \nof wheat stems. An increase in stem curvature corresponds to \nbending motion similar to that induced by wind pressure. The \nresulting displacements along the stem increase with height \nfrom zero at ground level to a maximum for ear tips. We have \nmodeled two cases, one with small RMS ear tip displacements \nof 0.7cm, and the other with larger displacements of 1.3cm. \nWe have chosen to simulate at C-Band, with an antenna \nheight of 10m, and ground-ranges of 10.0m, 10.1m, 10.2m \nand 10.3m yielding three baselines. We simulate an area some \n6m by 6m at ~15cm resolution in ground-range and azimuth, \nand analyze a central area 4m by 4m in the resulting imagery, \nwhich is representative of a homogeneous canopy and clear of \nboundary effects resulting from layover. An example of \nsimulated imagery and coherence images is provided in Fig. 3. \nBackscattering coefficients are reported in Table I and are \nuseful in interpreting the results. \n \n \n \nTABLE I \nSIMULATED WHEAT BACKSCATTERING COEFFICIENTS. \n HH (dB) HV (dB) VV (dB) \nDirect Ground -19.0 -58.2 -30.6 \nDirect Volume -14.6 -33.0 -18.3 \nGround Volume -13.6 -27.7 -21.6 \nTotal -10.4 -26.3 -16.6 \n \nA full description of the polarimetric response of the data is \nto be found in [3]. We observe here that V attenuation is much \ngreater than H in the canopy and as a result VV returns are \npredominantly from material at the top of the canopy. At the \nsame time VV is darker than HH, and HV is somewhat under-\nestimated as a result of neglecting volume-volume interactions \nin the model. Nevertheless the results are in good agreement \nwith observations [3]. We observe that whilst direct volume \nterms dominate the VV response, ground-volume terms are \nstrongest in HH and most clearly seen in HV. Thus HV \nreturns have phase centers close to the ground in this model, \nalthough they are weak and are likely to be in competition \nwith noise and incoherent backscatter, which has not been \nmodeled. \nIn Fig. 4 we report the results of direct-volume coherence \ncalculations by polarimetric channel as a function of \nincreasing baseline, with varying amounts of clutter \ndisplacement. With no clutter motion coherence is high and \nVV demonstrates the greatest coherence. This is in keeping \nwith our observation that attenuation for V polarization is \nstrong and most returns come from near the top of the canopy \nyielding a well-defined phase centre. Perversely, when the \neffects of clutter motion are incorporated into the calculation, \nVV coherence falls the most: motion at the top of the canopy \nis greatest and hence has the strongest effect on the coherence \nof the VV returns that originate there. This model is in \nkeeping with recent X-Band observations for coherence over a \nwheat canopy of similar height [8]. We observe that for RMS \nwheat ear displacements of 1.3cm the model predicts that \ncoherence in VV is all but lost, and this would then preclude \nthe possibility of recovering crop height using interferometric \ntechniques.  \nFor smaller motion RMS displacements of 0.7cm volume \nFigure 2.  Example of model wheat plant and wheat \ncanopy used in the SAR simulation. Figure 3. Simulated GB-SAR images of wheat for the 20cm \nbaseline with no clutter motion and the resulting coherence image \nformed using a 5 by 5 window. \n       HH     HV          VH         VV\n1106\n0-7803-9050-4\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE. 1106\ncoherence is preserved: sufficiently well perhaps for \nPolInSAR techniques to be applied. We examine the effects of \nclutter motion on the recovery of canopy height using \nPolInSAR in Fig. 5. Since we observe that HV returns are \ndominated by the ground-volume response, and VV returns \nfrom the direct-volume response at the top of the canopy, we \nexamine VV and HV coherence in the complex plane for these \ntwo channels both in the absence and in the presence of clutter \nmotion in Fig 5. Whilst for different canopies and under \ndifferent circumstances this choice of channels may change, \nthe general conclusions concerning loss of coherence in \nvolume returns will still be applicable. \nWe observe a number of consequences of the effects of \ninter-aperture clutter motion. Firstly volume coherence is \nreduced. Ground-volume coherence (which dominates the HV \nreturns) is mostly unaffected, aside from a change in \nunderlying ground phase. The overall effect is to reduce the \nlength of the observable coherence line and thus increase the \npotential error in the recovered height.  \nThe change in coherence as a result of plant-element \ndisplacements results in different estimates of ground-phase \ncorrected volume coherence. For this example the estimated \nground-phase corrected volume-coherence changes from \n\u03c6\u03b3 ieste\u2212\u02c6 = 0.032 + i0.56 to \u03c6\u03b3 ieste\u2212\u02c6  = 0.28 + i0.31 in the \npresence of inter-aperture displacement. Since this value is \nrelated directly to canopy height and extinction estimates [9] \nwe conclude that displacement of plant elements between \nSAR apertures will corrupt estimates of canopy height and \nextinction using polarimetric SAR interferometry. \n \nIII.   SIGNAL PROCESSING GB-SAR IMAGE SIMULATION \n \nA. Distributed Scatterer Model \nIn addition to a full, physics-based calculation, we have \nperformed signal-processing simulations with a simplified \nmodel of the vegetation target. This model consists of a \ndistribution of point scatterers on a horizontal plane and does \nnot provide polarimetric information. However, with this \nmodel it is possible to simulate in greater detail the swept-\nfrequency technique used to generate GB-SAR imagery [2]. A \nwind force acting on the target is resolved into components \nparallel to and perpendicular to the principal imaging axes, so \nthat two independent differential equations are solved at each \ntime instant, providing exact target positional and velocity \ninformation in each of the two axes directions. Values of the \nmechanical constants determining the harmonic motion have \nbeen selected to be accordance with field observations. This \nallows the independent motions of each scatterer to be tracked \nduring the formation of the aperture, both during the \nfrequency sweep and from sample point to sample point along \nthe aperture. For computational efficiency the target elements \nare contained within an arc over a constant inclination angle \nrange, as motion produces spreading of the impulse response \nfunction principally in the azimuthal direction at constant \ninclination angle. Fig. 6 shows the static C-Band observation \nfrom a 10m height and ground-range 4m to 14m. \n \nB. Effects of Intra-Aperture Displacement Upon Coherence \nWe have simulated a static image, and two images with \nclutter motion present, representing \u2018small\u2019 and \u2018large\u2019 RMS \ndisplacements. The small motion corresponds to a mean radial \nphase displacement of 0.124cm measured over all frequencies \nduring the imaging process, as seen from the antennas point of \nview,  and 0.375cm for the large motion.  \nFig 4. Effects of inter-aperture clutter motion on interferometric direct \nvolume coherence by polarimetric channel. RMS wheat ear \ndisplacements are zero (top 3 curves), 0.7cm (middle 3) and 1.3cm \n(lower 3). VV returns come predominantly from the top of the canopy \nwhere displacements are greatest. \nFigure 5. Effects of clutter motion on attempts to recover vegetation \nheight and extinction using VV and HV coherence as volume and \nground indicators respectively. Clutter motion shortens the extent of the \nsample in the complex coherence plane, and alters the recovered heights \nand extinctions. \nFig. 6. Simulated static-case GB-SAR image using the distributed \npoint scatterer model, for the parameters described in the preceding \ntext. The image represents an area 20m in azimuth and 10m in \nground-range. The features at the bottom corners are associated with \nrange-ambiguity aliasing. \n1107\n0-7803-9050-4\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE. 1107\nAll the simulations were made with identical imaging \ngeometries (zero interferometric baseline), and the results \nprovide understanding of the variation of coherence with \ndiffering clutter motion. Calculations have been performed on \nthe phase stability and corresponding coherence between the \nstatic and moving images for 4m x 4m sections of imagery \ncentered at a range of 10m at boresight, shown in Fig. 7. \nCoherence estimates are obtained using a sliding 5 x 5 pixel \nwindow, such that each pixel is not an independent measure of \ncoherence. The derived coherence distributions are dissimilar \nin shape from those typically associated with interferometry. \nCoherence remains high at 0.9 for the small RMS \ndisplacement case, and falls to 0.81 for the large \ndisplacements. Coupled to the previous result we anticipate \nthat small amounts of clutter motion, although having an \nadverse affect upon intra-aperture coherence, would not \npreclude the use of GB-SAR for studies in polarimetric SAR \ninterferometry.  \n \nIV. CONCLUSIONS \n \nWe have developed two models, a physics-based model and \na signal processing model, for GB-SAR observations of \nwheat. The models indicate that clutter motion will degrade \ninterferometric performance both during aperture formation, \nand between repeat-pass observation. However we conclude \nthat the GB-SAR system will be robust to small amounts of \nclutter motion and will serve as a suitable tool for PolInSAR \nexperimental studies. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n \nThis work has been supported by the University of Cranfield, \nand the Defence Science and Technology Organisation of \nAustralia. \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] S.
