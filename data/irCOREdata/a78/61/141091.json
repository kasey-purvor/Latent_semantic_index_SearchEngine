Introduction \nAdditive Layer Manufacturing has become an important industrial process for the manufacture of custom-made \nmetal workpieces. Innovative Wire and Arc Additive Layer Manufacture (WAALM) solutions have emerged \nrecently to fabricate highly reactive metallic components in an out-of-chamber environment (e.g. Ti-6Al-4V) \n[1]. Faster processing speeds and high deposition rate capabilities are central attributes to enable the production \nof large-scale aerospace components [2]. Although the wire-added ALM process has been around for almost a \ncentury \u2013 the first patent was filed 1920 by Baker [3] \u2013 modern welding and automation technologies provide \nopportunities that were not previously available. In addition, there is currently a demand for sustainable, low \ncost, environmentally friendly processes with high geometric flexibility. Finally, WAALM can be used to \ndeposit a variety of materials that can be welded, such as steel [4, 5], Ni alloys [6], and Ti alloys [1, 7]. \n   In the WAALM process, 3D metallic components are built by depositing beads of weld metal in a layer by \nlayer fashion. Standard wire based welding processes such as Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) and Gas \nTungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) are low cost solutions employed as heat sources, providing high deposition \nrates by utilising high energy input.   \n    However, the high heat input leads to significant distortion and residual stress. Finite Element (FE) analysis \ncan be used to predict the residual stress and distortion during additive manufacturing processes [8-10], enabling \nthe development of mitigation methods [11, 12]. Most of the FE analyses utilise transient models with a moving \nheat source. Element birth technique is used for simulating addition of material, providing accurate predictions. \nHowever, the model size is usually limited due to the computational time required for these simulations due to \nthe long processing time to make the real parts.  \nTherefore to develop models of large-scale WAALM components, which can scale to several meters, the \nconventional transient FE analysis is not suitable. A new method is needed to reduce the calculation time while \nkeeping the simulation accuracy high. For a long weld with a constant welding speed, the thermal histories \napproach a steady state, particularly in the middle of the weld. This phenomenon has been utilised in FE models \nof welding processes which have used a steady state model [13-16, 18]. \n_______________________________________________________________ \n1 Manufacturing Department, Cranfield University,  \n  Cranfield, MK43 0AL, UK \n2 Welding Engineering Research Centre, Cranfield University,  \n  Cranfield, MK43 0AL, UK \n*Corresponding author, email jialuo.ding@cranfield.ac.uk \n Unlike the conventional transient method which uses a time increment scheme to model the moving welding \ntorch, the steady state method attaches an Eulerian reference frame to the welding torch and the material \u201cflows\u201d \nthrough the mesh (Fig. 1). Therefore the problem can be solved for a single time step saving a large amount of \ncomputational time. Moreover, the model using the Eulerian frame does not need to use a high density mesh \nuniformly along the weld line, saving additional computational time [14]. While the steady state solution of the \nthermal problem is relatively trivial, application to the mechanical problem is more difficult, but has been \ndemonstrated by several authors [13, 14, 16, 17]. An alternative approach, developed by Colegrove et al.[18] cut \nthe Eulerian thermal model into a series of temperature data slices, and then transferred the sliced temperature \ndata onto a 2D elastic-plastic model.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1: Model with different reference frames. (a) Lagrangian reference frame (b) Eulerian reference frame. \n \nIn this paper, an efficient FE method is developed to analyse the thermo-mechanical performance of the \nWAALM process on a 500 mm mild steel multi-layer wall structure. Steady state temperature distributions are \ncalculated using the Eulerian thermal method, which are used as an input to a 3D mechanical model for residual \nstress and distortion analysis. A comparison was carried out between this efficient FE model and a conventional \ntransient thermo-mechanical model.  Both models are compared with experimental measurements of \ntemperature, residual stress and distortion. \n2. Experimental set-up \nSample walls were produced in mild steel using WAALM. The base plates used in the experiments were rolled \nstructural steel plates (grade S355JR-AR). The chemical composition of the alloy (in wt. %) is 0.24% C, 1.60 % \nMn, 0.55% Si, 0.045% P, 0.045% S, 0.009% N, 0.003-0.100% Nb and Fe balance. The selection of the \nconsumable electrode was based on a strict chemical composition criterion in order to obtain optimum as \nwelded mechanical properties. The chemical composition of the solid wire (in wt. %) is 0.08% C, 1.50% Mn, \n0.92% Si, 0.16% Cu, \u22640.040% P, \u22640.035% S and Fe balance. \n   The geometry of the structure is shown in Fig. 2. The walls were deposited along the centreline of the base \nplate with a width of 5 mm and a height of 2 mm for each layer. The heat source is a Cold Metal Transfer \n(CMT) [23] welding power source, a modified GMAW variant based on a controlled dip transfer mode \nmechanism, which can provide a high deposition rate capability at a relatively low heat input. The welding wire \nused in this study is 1.2 mm and the wire feed speed is 10 m min\n-1\n. The travel speed of the welding torch is 8.33 \nmm s\n-1\n. The welding process heat input is 269.5 J mm\n-1\n, assuming an efficiency of 0.9. A water cooled \naluminium backing plate was utilised in order to cool the sample more rapidly. A waiting time of 400 seconds \nwas used between subsequent layers enabling the sample to cool below 50\u00b0C before new layers were deposited. \nFour k-type thermocouples were welded at the positions indicated in Fig. 2. \nTo verify the mechanical model, residual strain measurements were carried out at the ENGIN-X strain \nscanner at ISIS, Oxford, UK. Residual stresses data of three directions are taken in the base plate at the position \n2mm below the top surface and located along the transverse direction of the mid-length section of WAALM \nsamples, which is shown in B-B section of Fig. 2. Residual stresses are also measured along the normal \ndirection of the mid-length section of the deposited wall. \n \n \n \nFig. 2: Geometry of the WAALM sample. \n \n    The time-of-flight principle of strain measurement is utilised to determine the lattice strain [24, 25]. The \nlongitudinal strain direction was measured using a gauge volume of 2\u00d72\u00d72 mm\n3\n, while the transverse and \nnormal strain directions were measured using a gauge volume of 2\u00d720\u00d72 mm\n3\n. The opening of the vertical \ndimension of the incoming beam during measurement of the transverse and normal strain directions would lead \nto a faster measurement with higher neutron flux without the loss of any spatial resolution. The data analysis \nwas performed for a time-of-flight spectrum of 20-40 milliseconds which contains the {110}, {200} and {211} \nfamilies of crystallographic planes. The range and families of crystallographic planes analysed ensured an \naverage macroscopic strain determination free from crystal anisotropy. The diffraction spectrum was analysed \nby Pawley refinement [26] using GSAS software. References for strain calculations were measured in the far \nfield parent in a 3 mm thick slice removed from the edge of the specimens. A constant stress free value was used \nfor the calculations of the strain in the base plate because the penetration level of the deposited wire would not \naffect the composition of the measurement location in the base plate. Different reference slice was used for the \nmeasurements on the deposited wall. \n    Strain measured in all the three directions were then combined to analyse the stress assuming the measured \ndirections are the principal strain directions and following Hooke\u201fs law as shown in equation 1. \n    \n)(\n)21)(1()1(\nzyxxx\nEE\n\uf065\uf065\uf065\n\uf075\uf075\n\uf075\n\uf065\n\uf075\n\uf073 \uf02b\uf02b\n\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\n            (1) \nWhere\nx\uf065 , y\uf065  and z\uf065  are the strains in the principal directions; E is the elasticity of the material; and\uf075  is \nPoisson's ratio of the material. \nIn addition, distortion was taken from the sample with 4 layer wall using a Romer Omega Arm with R-Scan \n3D laser scanning system. \n3. Thermo-mechanical FEM models \n3.1. FE thermal models \nThe FE software package, ABAQUS [19] was used for both the thermal and mechanical models.  Sequentially \ncoupled thermo-mechanical simulations were carried out which calculated the temperature distribution first and \nthen used the results for the mechanical analysis. Two model types were developed.  The first used a steady state \nthermal model which used an Eulerian reference frame, and the second used a transient model and Lagrangian \nreference frame. Only half of the material is modelled due to the symmetry along the central axis which shown \nas A-A in Fig. 2. \n \nFig. 3: Mesh of transient thermal model. \n    For the Lagrangian thermal model, linear brick elements with 8 nodes (DC3D8) are used for the thermal \nsimulation. To capture the thermal performance around the heat source, dense meshes of size 2 mm \u00d7 0.833 mm \n\u00d7 0.667 mm were used for the bead and the area near welding line. The meshes became coarser in the y \ndirection and \u2013z direction away from the welding line (Fig. 3). The filler material was simulated using the \n\u201celement birth technique\u201d [21]. All the elements of the bead are deactivated at the first step of the analysis, and \nthen the elements are activated sequentially following the heat source. \n   The moving heat source for the Lagrangian thermal model is generated with the user subroutine DFLUX in \nthe ABAQUS code. The Goldak double ellipsoidal heat source [20] was used to apply the heat to the additive \nmanufacture deposits. The power density of the region in front of the arc centre and the region behind the arc \ncentre is defined separately using: \n    \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\n\uf03d\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n336 c\nz\nb\ny\na\nx\nf\nf\nf\nf\ne\nbca\nQf\nq\n\uf070\uf070\n \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\n\uf03d\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n336 c\nz\nb\ny\na\nx\nr\nr\nr\nre\nbca\nQf\nq\n\uf070\uf070                                        (2) \n2\uf03d\uf02b rf ff  \nWhere fa  and ra are the length of the frontal ellipsoid and the rear ellipsoid, respectively; b is the width of the \nheat source; c is the depth of the heat source; Q  is the energy input considering the factor of efficiency; ff and \nrf are the factors for distributing the   power to the front and rear of the hear source.  \n    Detailed parameter settings for the heat source model used in this paper are shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Heat source parameters \nfa (mm) ra\n(mm) b (mm) c (mm) Q (W) ff  rf  \n2 6 2.5 3 2245.83 0.6 1.4 \n \nFig. 4 shows the mesh used for the steady-state model. Unlike the transient model, the steady-state model \ndoes not require a uniform mesh with high density along the weld line. Forced convection\/ diffusion brick \nelements (DCC3D8) were utilised in this model. The smallest elements are located in the heating area with a \nsize of 1.667 mm \u00d7 0.833 mm \u00d7 0.667 mm, while the largest ones are at the outlet face with the size of 344.656 \nmm \u00d7 5.407 mm \u00d7 2.712 mm. A mass flow rate per area, which equals to the welding speed multiply with the \nmaterial density, is used to represent the torch movement.  The heat distribution for the steady state model is \nalso represented with the same Goldak double ellipsoidal heat source. \n \n \nFig. 4: Mesh of the steady state thermal model. \n \nAs the component did not cool down to ambient temperature between deposits it was necessary to include the \neffect of the residual temperature in the models for the 2\nnd\n, 3\nrd\n and 4\nth\n layers.  This was done by taking the nodal \ntemperatures from the outlet surface for the previous model and applying them to the inlet surface of the model \nfor the next layer.  To provide an accurate prediction of the outlet temperature the length of the model is set so \nthat: \nL = Vtorch \u00d7 Twaiting + Lactual                                    (3)  \nWhere L is the length of the Eulerian thermal model; \nVtorch is the travel speed of the welding torch; Twaiting is the waiting time between subsequent layers; and Lactual is \nthe actual length of the sample.  \nUsing this approach, the effective cooling time between subsequent layers is identical to the experimental \ncondition. \n    Both models used thermal material properties from Zhang and Michaleris [16]. An artificially high thermal \nconductivity is used for temperatures greater than 1500\u00b0C to capture the convective heat transfer in the weld \npool. The radiation coefficient and the convection coefficient are assumed independent of the temperature and \nare set to 0.2 and 5.7 Wm\n-2\nK\n-1\n, respectively. The heat loss through the cooling system under the base plate is \nmodelled with an equivalent convection coefficient. This coefficient was found by running a series of numerical \ntrials, and tuning the value so that the predicted temperature profiles matched the experimental results. A value \nof 300 Wm\n-2\nK\n-1\n gave the best match with the experiments. \n \n3.2. FE mechanical models \nThe Lagrangian mechanical model uses the same meshing as the Lagrangian thermal model, but the mesh type \nis changed to integrated 3D 8-node element (C3D8R). The steps for the mechanical simulation are set with the \nsame number and time as the thermal simulation. The nodal temperature results calculated from the thermal \nanalysis are utilised as thermal load input for the mechanical simulation. \n   A 3D elastic-plastic mechanical model is used to calculate the residual stress from the steady state thermal \nmodel data.  The length of the mechanical model was 500 mm which was the actual length of the experimental \nsample. It was meshed with the same mesh spacing as the steady state model in the y and z directions, however \nthe spacing in the x direction was set to a constant value of 2.5 mm.  \n    To use steady state thermal results as the input to the mechanical model, the static nodal temperature data \nwere transferred to thermal histories by dividing the position in the x direction by the travel speed. Temperature \nhistories were added sequentially using the results from the model with one layer bead to the model with four \nlayer bead. The stress analysis was carried out by applying the transferred thermal history sequentially to the 3D \nmechanical model. The temperature field from the steady state model is effectively mapped to the mechanical \nmodel using a pre-processing programme generated in Matlab. \n \u201cElement birth technique\u201d was utilised in both mechanical models for simulating the adding process of the \nfiller materials. Both models used temperature dependant mechanical properties from Zhang and Michaleris \n[16]. The phase transformations are ignored in this study, as it has an insignificant effect on the welding residual \nstress for mild steel [22]. To avoid difficulties in convergence, a \u201ecut-off temperature\u201f of 1000\u00b0C was used in the \nmaterial model. The Young\u201fs modulus and the yield stress of the material remain at the same value for \ntemperatures above the cut off temperature. \n   To simulate the clamping system used in the WAALM process, a \u201ebacking plate\u201f was included with rigid \nmaterial properties. A hard contact is applied between the contact surface of the base plate and the backing \nplate. This prevents the points on the base plate to moving in \u2013z direction but not against the movement in +z \ndirection. Clamps in the real WAALM experiment are located on the four corners and the mid length of the base \nplate. This was modelled by fixing the movements of the nodes at the corresponding positions. The clamping \nconstraints were removed in the stages when the base plate was unclamped. \n3.3. Time comparison \n   The comparison of the computational time used for the two models is presented in Table 2. All the simulations \nwere calculated on a grid computing system with four processors. The computational time consumed by the \ntransient thermal model can be greatly reduced by using the steady-state model. The transient thermal model \nprovides much more data than the steady state model as it calculates the incremental temperature histories, \nwhich result in more time increments needed for completing the mechanical analysis. The number of time \nincrement for completing one step with transient mechanical model is 32 increments in average, while the \nmechanical model using the mapped steady state thermal results needs only 20 increments to complete the same \nstep. Thus, the time taken for the mechanical model based on the steady-state model was reduced by around \n40%. Hence the total time saving with the new model is around 80%. \n \nTable 2: Computational time comparison between the transient model and the steady state based model \n Thermal analysis \ntime  \nMechanical analysis  \ntime  \nTotal analysis \ntime  \nTransient model 51hours, 24minutes 24hours, 1minute 75hours, 25minutes \nSteady state model 10minutes 14hours, 46minutes 14hours, 56minutes \nTime saving  99.69% 38.51% 80.21% \n \n4. Results and discussion \n4.1. Thermal results \nFig. 5 presents the contour plots of temperature results of the Lagrangian thermal model and the Eulerian \nthermal model, respectively. Both models produced similar heating and cooling cycles. \n \n \nFig. 5: Temperature distribution from: (a) transient and (b) steady-state thermal models. \n   The thermal models were verified by comparing the temperature history results from the four thermocouples \npositions on the base plate shown in Fig. 2. These results are presented in Fig. 7. As the steady-state model does \nnot have a time related history, the thermal cycle of the testing point is obtained by plotting the temperature \nalong lines with fixed y, and z coordinates which correspond to the thermocouple positions shown in Fig. 2. The \ntime coordinate is found by dividing the position in the x direction by the travel speed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 6: Temperature verification on the measuring positions of (a) TP1 (250, 5, 0), (b) TP2 (250, 20, 0), (c) TP3 \n(250, 0, -12), (d) TP4 (375, 0, -8). \n \n   Both, the transient and steady-state thermal models give accurate predictions of the temperatures at the four \nthermocouple positions. Although the steady state model underestimates the temperature marginally because \nheat can be conducted via the elements behind the heat source, the effect is small because of the high travel \nspeed. \n4.2. Mechanical results \n    Fig. 7 (a) and (b) illustrate the predicted longitudinal residual stress of the four layer wall with clamping from \nthe two model types, which indicate similar results. The heat from the welding process causes a tensile residual \nstress along the weld bead due to material contraction during solidification, which causes a balancing \ncompressive residual stress in the base plate.  Note that the magnitude of the compressive stress is greatest \nwhere clamping has been applied due to the restraint in this region. There is significant distortion of the \ncomponent and relaxation of the stresses after the clamping was removed which is illustrated in Fig. 7(c).  To \nbetter understand these stress changes, the longitudinal stress was plotted along the dotted lines in Fig. 7(b, c) in \nFig. 7 (d). \n    Fig. 7 (d) shows that when the specimen is clamped, the highest longitudinal stress occurs in the deposited \nwall.  The stress predicted across the deposit is very uniform with very little annealing of the earlier layers by \nthe latter ones.  To further investigate this finding, a further 4 layers were deposited (giving 8 layers in total) and \nthe results plotted in Fig. 7 (d).  There is little change in the stresses generated, further supporting this finding.  \nIndeed Chin et al. [8] found a similar result in their model of additive layer manufacture.  The stresses in the \nbase plate adjacent to the deposited wall are also tensile, however there is a significant drop in magnitude since \nthe material in the base is softer than the weld metal.  It is only near the bottom of the base plate that the \nlongitudinal stresses go into compression.   \n    The significant drop in the longitudinal stress after unclamping is also shown in Fig. 7 (d).  The interesting \naspects of this plot occur toward the extremities.  For example, the stress at the top of the deposited wall has a \nmuch lower value than at the interface due to the bending distortion of the sample. This distortion also causes \nthe compressive stress at the bottom of the base plate to go into tension. There is a reduction in the tensile \nlongitudinal residual stress measured in the base plate with increased layers due to the influence of bending \ndistortion. This is reflected in the residual stress measurements shown in Fig. 7 (b) where four and eight layer \nwalls are compared unclamped. \n    To have an overall check of the mechanical results, the predicted distortion along the long edge from the two \nmechanical models was compared with the measured distortion from the two long edges of the sample. Fig. 8 \nshows how the distorted shape from both models is nearly identical and agrees with the experimentally \nmeasured distortion.  \n \n \nFig. 7: Longitudinal residual stress predictions from: (a) transient thermal and mechanical models; (b) steady \nstate thermal and mapped mechanical models; (c) steady state thermal and mapped mechanical models after \nclamps were removed (a scaling factor of 5 is used for the distorted shape); and (d) the stress plotted along the \nlines shown in of (b) and (c). \n \n \nFig. 8: Distortion verification along the longitudinal direction after the clamps were removed. \n \nDetailed validation of the residual stress data was provided by comparing the computational results for \ndifferent numbers of deposited layers with those from neutron diffraction measurements.Fig. 9 shows the \ncomparison on the base plate. In both the modelling and experimental results the clamps have been removed, \nand three principle directions have been considered namely: longitudinal (\u03c3LD), transverse (\u03c3TD), and normal \n(\u03c3ND). The results are similar to those observed in long welding processes with the longitudinal stress \ndominating over the transverse and normal stresses [21]. The FE predictions match the experimental results well \nin all cases except the 1 layer wall where the model underpredicts the stresses.  Moreover, there is a more \nsignificant reduction in the experimentally measured stresses between the 1 and 2 layer walls, than in the \nstresses predicted by the models.  A possible explanation is that the model does not fully capture the \nmicrostructural changes which occur in the actual material. \nA sample with 20 layer wall was made to validate the residual stress on the deposited wall. Longitudinal stress was \nmeasured without clamps in the mid-section along the normal direction of the deposited wall. Due to the long \ncomputational time the transient model need, the model based on the steady-state thermal solution was used for the \nprediction. The comparison demonstrated in Fig. 10 shows that the numerical prediction matches the experimental \nresult well also on the deposited wall. The longitudinal stress goes into compression on the top layers. \n \n \n  \nFig. 9: Stresses in the longitudinal (LD), transverse (TD) and normal (ND) directions along a transverse line in \nthe base-plate indicated in Fig. 2 for (a) single, (b) two, and (c) three layers. \n \nFig. 10: Longitudinal stress along the normal direction of the mid-section in the deposited wall. \n    In general, unevenly distributed stresses generated during the WAALM process can cause big distortions on \nthe parts after the clamps removed. Depending on the application, it will be necessary to provide a subsequent \nheat treatment to relieve these stresses and improve the mechanical properties that would be affected by tensile \nresidual stresses. The FEM models introduced in this paper can provide accurate prediction of the stresses and \ndistortions of the WAALM process. This will be useful for future work where the WAALM process will be \noptimised to minimise the residual stress and distortion. \n \n5. Conclusions \nIn this study, the thermo-elastic-plastic FEM is employed to simulate the thermo-mechanical performance of \nlarge multi-layer wall shaped WAALM structures. Experiments are carried out to verify the temperature \ndistribution, stress distribution and distortions. Moreover, an efficient FE method based on Eulerian steady-state \nthermal analysis is also discussed. According to the results in this study, the following conclusions can be \ndrawn: \n1) Both FEM models can accurately predict the heating and cooling cycles during the WAALM process. The \nsteady-state model can also be used for dealing with the multi-layer WAALM process.   \n2) The stress evolution analysed using the numerical model shows that stress across the deposit is very \nuniform with very little influence of the preceding layers on the following layers. \n3) A significant stress redistribution is observed after unclamping. The stress at the top of the deposited wall \nhas a much lower value than at the interface due to the bending distortion of the sample. The neutron \ndiffraction strain scanner ENGIN-X reveals a good match of the predicted stress data with the \nmeasurements. The measured distortions also support the model predictions. \n4) The new FEM approach based on the steady-state thermal model shows a significant advantage of around \n80% on the computational time. This will be useful for future work where the WAALM process will be \noptimised to minimise the residual stress and distortion. \nAcknowledgement \nThis research was carried out under RUAM project (131) of the IMRC (Innovative Manufacturing Research \nCentre) Cranfield funded by EPSRC, UK.
