In this paper \nwe review a long-standing theory that some dyslexics\u2019 reading impairments are due to \nimpairments in hemispheric transfer. We test this theory in a computational model of \nreading, implementing anatomical features of the visual system. We demonstrate that, \nwhen callosal transfer is impaired, the model reads nonwords as well as an unimpaired \nmodel, but reads exception words poorly: a pattern of behaviour similar to surface \ndyslexia. This computational modelling provides a causal link between brain-based \ntheories of dyslexia to cognitive-level theories that refer specifically to phonological \nimpairments within the reading system. \n 3 \nApproximately 5-10% of the population show reading impairment greater than would be \npredicted by performance on other cognitive tasks (Pennington, 2002). Accounts of these \nreading impairments can be made at a number of different levels of description (Jackson \n& Coltheart, 2001), consequently, alternative theories of dyslexia may be describing the \nsame impairment with a consistent aetiology, though the link between levels for \ndescribing dyslexia is not yet well understood (for a review see Bishop & Snowling, \n2004). \nIt is generally accepted that a large proportion of developmental dyslexics have \nphonological impairments (Bishop & Snowling, 2004; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). In \nterms of brain functioning, Shaywitz et al. (2003) claim that the phonological deficit is \ndue to a dysfunctional left hemisphere (LH) cortical region involved in phonological \nprocessing. Other theories describe the phonological impairment in terms of dysfunction \nwithin brain systems that are not language specific, such as the cerebellum (Nicolson, \nFawcett, & Dean, 2001), or the visual magnocellular pathways (Lovegrove, Martin, \nBlackwood, & Badcock, 1980; Stein & Walsh, 1997). An auditory magnocellular deficit, \nwhich results in impairment to speech processing, has also been proposed (Bishop, 2007; \nTallal et al., 1996). \n Evidence for these brain theories is generally derived from correlating dyslexics\u2019 \nreading performance with deficits on other cognitive tasks that depend on the same \nimpaired brain system (Eden & Zefirro, 1998; Ramus et al., 2003; Vellutino, Fletcher, \nSnowling, & Scanlon, 2004). However, co-occurrence of deficits does not prove a \ncommon cause, and so it is therefore necessary to demonstrate precisely how a brain \ndeficit may impact on cognitive processing in order to establish a direct, causal link \n 4 \nbetween brain-level theories and cognitive impairments. \nIn this paper we test a direct link between a brain-level theory of dyslexia and its \ncognitive consequences, namely, that reading impairments are caused by dysfunctional \ncoordination and transfer of information between the two cerebral hemispheres \n(Geschwind & Galaburda, 1986; Orton, 1925). The hemispheric dissociation theory of \ndyslexia has a long tradition, drawing on anatomical differences in the brains of dyslexics \nand controls, and behavioural evidence of similarities in cognitive deficits in dyslexics \nand individuals with an impaired corpus callosum. We present a computational model \nthat implements this theory, providing an explicit test of how far a direct link can be \nmade between a proposed brain cause of dyslexia and a manifestation of reading deficits \nat the cognitive level of description. \n  \nHemispheric dissociation in dyslexics \nAnatomical studies of dyslexic and control brains have suggested reduced \ncerebral asymmetry in dyslexics (Galaburda, Menard, & Rosen, 1994; Haslam, Dalby, \nJohns, & Rademaker, 1981; Hier, Le May, Rosenberger, & Perlo, 1978; Rumsey, \nDorwart, Vermess, Denckla, Kruesi, & Rapoport, 1986), consistent with Orton\u2019s (1925) \nview that reading difficulties resulted from an impairment in the LH\u2019s dominance over \nthe right hemisphere (RH) (Annett, 1996). Dyslexics tend to have a larger RH planum \ntemporale than controls (Beaton, 1997), an area related to language lateralisation \n(Foundas et al., 1994), and close to a region that shows an absence of activity in \ndyslexics\u2019 reading neural network (Temple et al., 2003). Anatomical studies of the corpus \ncallosum have indicated that dyslexics tend to have a larger isthmus and splenium (Duara \n 5 \net al., 1991; Robichon & Habib, 1998), and a smaller posterior midbody and genu than \ncontrols (Fine, Semrud-Clikeman, Keith, Stapleton, & Hynd, 2007; Von Plessen et al., \n2002), differences that have been related to deficient lateralisation in posterior language-\nrelated areas (Rumsey et al., 1999). \n There is substantial behavioural evidence that dyslexics have impaired \nhemispheric transfer. Callosal agenesis is a developmental disorder in which the corpus \ncallosum fails to develop normally, with callosal fibres failing to connect across the \nhemispheres. Children with callosal agenesis have problems in phonological processing \ntasks that dyslexics typically find difficult (Temple & Ilsley, 1993; Temple, Jeeves, & \nVillaroya, 1990), and both groups have coordination problems in responding with left and \nright hand, tactile finger localization, pointing to sound sources, and discriminating \nvisually presented lines. Dyslexics and partial or complete commisurotomy patients are \nalso similar in terms of coordinating responses with two hands, disengaging attention \nfrom spatial cues, and ERP responses to valid and invalid visual cues (see Mather, 2001, \nfor a review). Tasks that directly test the quality and speed of hemispheric transfer also \nshow differences between dyslexics and controls (e.g.,. Beaumont, Thomson, & Rugg, \n1981; Henderson, Barca, & Ellis, 2007).  \n \nModelling causes of dyslexia \nThe distinction between phonological and surface dyslexia subtypes has been most \ninfluential in computational models of dyslexia (Bailey, Manis, Pedersen, & Seidenberg, \n2004). Children with phonological dyslexia have difficulty in reading nonwords, or novel \nwords, though reading of known words is good. In contrast, surface dyslexic children can \n 6 \nread nonwords but tend to over-generalise in the pronunciation of exception words, such \nas pint, bomb, or bind (Castles & Coltheart, 1993; Stanovich, Siegel, & Gottardo, 1997). \nSurface dyslexia may be more accurately seen as a reading delay, in that reading of \nexception words is poor in younger children, but develops over time (Manis, Seidenberg, \nDoi, McBride-Chang, & Petersen, 1996). \nSeveral computational models of reading have highlighted impairments that may \nlead to dyslexia. The Dual Route Cascading (DRC) model (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, & \nLangdon, 2001) was constructed to embody within its architecture the dissociation \nbetween impairments to nonword and exception word reading, by including a route that \nread each stimulus type. In contrast, researchers in the connectionist tradition have \nproposed that dyslexia subtypes can result from impairments to a single physical system \nmapping written forms onto spoken forms without postulating separate routes a priori \n(Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989). In this class of models, phonological dyslexia \nbehaviour results from impairments in the creation of stable phonological representations, \nand surface dyslexia results from shortage of resources or slowed learning of the mapping \nof words onto their spoken forms (Harm & Seidenberg, 1999; Plaut, Seidenberg, \nMcClelland, & Patterson, 1996; Seidenberg, & McClelland, 1989) However, nonword \nreading and exception word reading were not entirely dissociable in these models, \nperhaps reflecting the prevalence of mixed cases, but cases of pure surface dyslexia are \nbeyond their remit (Castles & Coltheart, 1996). \nThese accounts of surface dyslexia are based on a general quantitative resource \nlimitation; as such they represent a strong claim about cortical plasticity, where the brain \nI assumed to be unable to solve a mapping problem that is within the abilities of \n 7 \ncomputational models containing only 100 interconnected units. Although such accounts \nsuccessfully demonstrate the relative vulnerability of exception words, they are \nunderspecified with respect to any neuropsychological basis for the resource limitation. \nThe same argument may be applied to \u201cdivision of labour\u201d accounts of dissociations in \ndyslexia, where surface dyslexia is due to greater reliance on reading via semantics rather \nthan directly from orthography to phonology. Although the more arbitrary, idiosyncratic \nrelationship between the respective orthographic and phonological representations of \n\u201cyacht\u201d or \u201cpint\u201d may tilt the processor away from complete reliance on the phonological \nroute compared with words with regular pronunciations, this mapping is again a \nrelatively trivial computational problem compared with the massive arbitrariness that the \nbrain copes with in the rest of the lexicon, for instance in mapping words\u2019 phonology \nonto semantics.  \nOur model of dyslexia builds on the connectionist modelling tradition, but we \ninstantiate anatomical features of the visual system in the model in assuming the minimal \narchitecture necessary given by the observable anatomy of the brain. The most \ncompelling account of reading phenomena is one in which the required behaviour \nemerges from the structure of the problem that is already given in the interaction between \nthe information structure of the lexicon and the architecture of the cognitive system. The \nmodel is illustrated in Figure 1. The critical innovation is instantiating two sets of hidden \nunits, representing resources in the LH and RH, with connections between these sets of \nunits representing the corpus callosum.  \nIn the brain, visual input from the left visual field (LVF) projects initially to the \nRH, and input from the right visual field (RVF) projects initially to the LH. This \n 8 \ncontralateral projection is precisely defined in that the fovea, the high-resolution centre of \nthe visual field, also demonstrates this divided projection to the left and right cortices \n(see, e.g., Fendrich & Gazzaniga, 1989; Lavidor & Walsh, 2004; Leff, 2004). Isolated \nwords are processed with greatest facility when fixated slightly to the left of centre, \nconsequently, the visual information about the word is initially divided equitably between \nthe LH and RH (Brysbaert, 1994; Shillcock, Ellison, & Monaghan, 2000).  \n A critical question is what effect this initial division of the visual field has on \nvisual word processing. At some point the orthographic information in the two hemifields \nhas to be combined to specify the identity of the word and to access its phonological form \nand its meaning. The point at which this integration occurs is a matter of debate, yet the \npsycholinguistic and attentional effects of this division are seen in higher levels of \nlanguage processing indicating that the division has a profound influence (Ellis, Brooks, \n& Lavidor, 2005; Hsiao & Shillcock, 2005; Jung-Beeman, 2005; Lavidor & Ellis, 2002, \n2003; Lavidor, Hayes, Shillcock, & Ellis, 2004; Young & Ellis, 1985). Elsewhere, we \nhave explored the implications of this initial splitting for visual word recognition in \ntheoretical (Shillcock, Ellison, & Monaghan, 2000), and connectionist (Shillcock & \nMonaghan, 2001a) models of normal reading, and such effects have also been \nsuccessfully simulated in the SERIOL model of reading with initial division of visual \nprocessing between the two hemispheres (Whitney & Cornelissen, 2004).  \n Reading exception words in particular requires integration of the orthographic \ninformation in each hemifield to occur prior to pronunciation. If the orthographic \ninformation is not effectively integrated before the point at which the phonological \nrepresentation is formed then the phonological representation will be formed \n 9 \ncomponentially and regularisation errors will tend to occur. Consider the word pint, \nfixated close to the optimal viewing position as pi*nt, where * indicates the fixation \npoint. (For convenience, we do not consider the splitting of individual letters in fixation; \nsuch splitting does not materially affect the case we make.) There are 14 English word \nlemmas of length 4 beginning with pi (pied, pimp, ping, pith, piss, pike, pier, pint, pine, \npill, pipe, pink, pile, and pick). Of these, 7 have a vowel pronunciation \/\u0399\/, 6 \/\u03b1\u0399\/, and 1 \n\/\u0399\u2194\/. Attempting to predict the vowel from the last letters (nt) is harder still: there are 25 \nword lemmas ending nt, and 8 different vowel pronunciations are possible: \/\u0398\/, \/\u0391:\/, \/\u03b1\u0399\/, \n\/\u2194\u03a5\/, \/\u0395\/, \/\u0399\/, \/\u0000\/, and \/\u2118\/. Hence, information about the onset and the coda has to be \ncombined before the vowel can be pronounced. If transfer is impaired, then the most \nfrequent vowel consistent with the pi and nt pairing is most likely to be accessed, which \nwould be \/\u0399\/, a classic instance of over-generalisation.  \nFormally, reading exception words is akin to the XOR problem, a class of linearly \ninseparable problems. A connectionist model with split input and with no interaction \nbetween the two halves before the output is equivalent to a perceptron and will not be \nable to solve the mapping (Minsky & Papert, 1969), and exception word reading will be \nparticularly impaired without adequate hemispheric transfer. However, as is evident from \nManis et al.\u2019s (1996) study, most children with surface dyslexia are poorer in reading \nregular words, though nonword reading is relatively intact. With hemispheric dissociation \nof visual information, if there is inadequate combination of letter information from the \nLVF and RVF then, even for regular words, reading will be somewhat impaired. In the \ncase of the regular word mint, for example, fixated as mi*nt, pronunciations of words \nconsistent with mi will be partially activated in one half of the system, and words \n 10 \nconsistent with nt will be activated in the other half. The word pint is among this set, and \nso the vowel \/\u03b1\u0399\/ will be partially activated. Thus, hemispheric dissociation provides a \npotential account of surface dyslexia, and predicts that it generally involves some small \ndeficit in reading regular words. \nIn the first set of models, we adapted Harm and Seidenberg\u2019s (1999) connectionist \nmodel of reading by incorporating a divided visual field and two banks of units \nrepresenting the two hemispheres. We also tested an impaired version of this model, by \nimpeding the transfer of information between its two halves. The third simulation tested \nthe effect of increasing resources on normal and impaired reading performance in the \nmodel. \n \nSimulations 1 and 2: Normal and impaired reading with divided visual input \nThe model employed in this set of simulations was a variation on the Harm and \nSeidenberg (1999) model, with two innovations: (1) orthographic input to the model was \npresented according to information about fixation positions of words during reading1; and \n(2) the visual field was divided into a left and right half, and projected contralaterally to a \ndivided hidden layer.  \nArchitecture \nThe input layer of the model was divided into two sets of units, representing the LVF and \nRVF (Figure 1). Each half of the input layer had five letter slots, each comprising 26 \n                                                \n1 We also tested a version of the model with words at the input presented at a single position, aligned at the \nvowel, as in Harm and Seidenberg\u2019s (1999) model. We found that this training regime resulted in similar \nbehaviour to that of the models presented here, both for normal and impaired versions of the model \n(Shillcock & Monaghan, 2001b). \n 11 \nunits, to represent individual letters of the input. In Figure 1, word is fixated between the \n2nd and 3rd letters. The hidden layer was also divided into two sets of 100 units, \nrepresenting the LH and RH. The left input units were fully connected to the right hidden \nunits, and the right input was fully connected to the left hidden units to reflect the initial \nprojection of the visual fields onto the contralateral hemispheres. In Figure 1, arrows \nbetween layers indicate connectivity. The hidden units were fully connected to an output \nlayer, where the phonological form of the input word was represented. The output layer \nwas composed of 8 phoneme slots: 3 slots for the onset, 2 for the nucleus and 3 for the \ncoda of monosyllabic words. Each slot contained 11 units, representing phonological \nfeatures as used by Harm and Seidenberg (1999), with values between \u20131 and 1. Empty \nslots were represented by 11 features with a -1 target activation. We extended Harm and \nSeidenberg\u2019s phonological representations to British English by including more British-\nEnglish diphthongs, adding \/\u04d8\/, and using more slots for onset and coda. Each output unit \nwas self-connected with a weight set at .75, resulting in decay of activation over time. \nThe output layer was connected to a set of 25 units that acted as clean-up units for the \nphonological representation at the output and also countered the decay in activation \nresulting from the output layer\u2019s self-connections.  \nIn the normal model of reading (Simulation 1) we fully connected the two sets of \nhidden units to each other. In the model with impaired callosal connectivity (Simulation \n2) we omitted these connections but included self-connections between units within each \nhidden layer, such that each hidden unit was connected to all other hidden units in the \nsame layer. These patterns ensured that the number of connections in each model was the \nsame, and also allowed the same degree of recurrence to occur in each model. \n 12 \nTraining and Testing \nThe model learned to map orthography onto phonology for all 3573 monosyllabic \nwordforms of length five or less with frequency greater than one per million in the \nCELEX database (Baayen, Pipenbrock, & Gulikers, 1995). Words were presented in \nrandom order, according to their log-compressed frequency (Plaut et al., 1996), and \noccurred in all possible fixation positions, as indicated in Figure 2, resulting in 18,910 \ntraining patterns. In naturalistic reading, words are fixated at any and all positions during \nreading of text with a slight preference for fixations towards word centre, though we do \nnot implement this fixation preference as it is very slight for short words (Brysbaert & \nVitu, 1998). We make the simplifying assumption that words are fixated an equal number \nof times in each position, and so presentation position was randomly selected. \n We pre-trained the model\u2019s phonological attractors in a \u201clistening task\u201d by \npresenting the phonological form for words at the output, and allowing the model 5 time \nintervals to reproduce the phonology. The learning rate was .001, and 1 million listening \ntrials were presented to the model, after which the model\u2019s performance was 100% \naccurate. We then trained the model to map orthography to phonology using recurrent \nbackpropagation over 7 time intervals. At time 1, the input representation of the word \nwas introduced. At time 2, activation passed from input to hidden units. At time 3, the \ntarget output representation for the word was presented, and activation passed from the \nhidden units to the output units, and between the hidden units. For time steps 4 to 7, \nactivation passed between the output layer and the phonological attractors layer, and \ncontinued to pass between the hidden units and from the hidden units to the output layer. \nThe learning rate was .005, and 10 million word tokens were presented. \n 13 \nThe model was tested by assessing the phonological feature representation of the \nword at the output at each phoneme slot position. The Euclidean distance from the \nmodel\u2019s actual output to all possible phonemes and the empty slot representation was \ncomputed. The model\u2019s production was taken to be the phoneme corresponding to the \nsmallest distance for each slot. The model was judged to have read the word correctly if \nall 6 slots corresponded to their target phoneme. \n To test nonword reading, we took the 357 nonwords of length 5 letters or less \nused by Harm and Seidenberg (1999). We also tested the model on the 48 exception \nwords from Taraban and McClelland (1987). For all tests, accuracy was tested at all \npresentation positions for each word. We repeated each simulation 8 times. \nResults and Discussion \nFigure 3a shows performance in Simulation 1 \u2013 the connected hemispheres model \u2013 on \nreading words, nonwords and exception words. After 10 million patterns the model \nperformed well, with 95.5% of the words read correctly. Exception words were 86.0% \ncorrect. The connected hemispheres model read 73.1% of the nonwords appropriately, \ncomparable to the 79% in Harm and Seidenberg\u2019s (1999) simulations. The hemispheric \nmodel\u2019s performance was slightly lower than that of Harm and Seidenberg\u2019s (1999) for \noverall reading accuracy and nonword reading; this difference was due principally to the \nlarger training set (18,910 patterns compared with 3,123) and the more complex \nphonological representation (8 phoneme slots compared with 6), rather than to the \ndifferent architecture used. A hemispheric model trained on a word set comparable to that \nof Harm and Seidenberg\u2019s model learned to 99% correct after five million presentations \n(Shillcock & Monaghan, 2001b). The connected model of reading therefore learns to read \n 14 \nthe training set accurately, and demonstrates generalisation to new words similar to that \nof other connectionist models of reading, providing a good basis for testing impairments \nto the structure of the model. \nFigure 3b shows the results of Simulation 2, the disconnected hemispheres model. \nAs predicted, the model\u2019s performance is worse than the connected model on reading \nwords, with 87.8% of the training set read correctly, t(14) = 18.49, p < .001. The reading \nof nonwords was at a level comparable to that of the connected model, with 71.8% read \ncorrectly, though marginally significantly less accurate, t(14) = 1.81, p = .09. Also as \npredicted, the disconnected model read exception words substantially less accurately than \nthe connected model, reading 62.4% correctly, t(14) =  32.33, p < .001. Table 1 provides \nexamples of exception word reading by the disconnected model at the end of training. \nThe errors are typically over-regularisations, of a type characteristic of surface dyslexics \n(e.g., Manis et al., 1996).  \nThe consequences of impaired transfer between the two sets of hidden units are \ntherefore multiple. Performance overall is slightly poorer on the whole set of words used \nfor training compared with the connected model, yet performance on nonwords was not \nsubstantially affected by this disconnection, indicating that generalization relied on \n\u201ccomponential\u201d processing. Yet, the most striking effect was on the exception words, \nwhere performance was much lower in the disconnected version of the model. This result \nis achieved without introducing parametric constraints, such as a reduced learning rate or \nreduced hidden layer resources. The impairment to reading exception words is due to the \narchitecture of the disconnected model.  \n The model learned to read each word in the training set in all possible \n 15 \npresentation positions. Yet, as with the SERIOL model of reading (Whitney & \nCornelissen, 2004), the similar properties of the same word presented in different \npositions was discovered by the model. Hence, if the model made a reading error in one \nposition, it was likely to make the same error in other presentation positions: errors at \nonly one presentation position accounted for 20.1% and 11.8% of the connected- and \ndisconnected-hemispheres models\u2019 errors, respectively. Consistent with the additional \nprocessing load of single hemisphere processing of stimuli (Monaghan & Pollmann, \n2003; Weissmann & Banich, 2000), there was no evidence for a systematic advantage for \nreading words unilaterally in the model. For the connected hemispheric model for all \nwords of length greater than 2, 95.0% of words were read correctly in the LVF and in the \nRVF, and 95.7% were read correctly when presented across the visual fields, which was \nsignificantly greater than RVF presentations, t(3569) = 3.35, p < .001, but not greater \nthan LVF presentations, t(3569) = 1.03, p = .30. In the disconnected model, 78.0% \npresented to the LVF were read correctly, 77.0% presented to the RVF were read \ncorrectly, and 77.1% of medially presented words were read correctly. None of the \nproportions correct differed significantly by presentation position, all t(3569) < 1. We \npredict that there would be little change in performance for surface dyslexic children for \nlateralised word reading, though we know of no studies that have tested this. \nSeveral connectionist models have reproduced the surface dyslexia subtype by \nreducing the resources available for the mapping from orthographic representations to \nphonological representations (e.g., Harm & Seidenberg, 1999; Seidenberg & McClelland, \n1989). We tested whether the behaviour of our models was due to resource limitations in \nthe model without \u201ccallosal\u201d connections by increasing the number of units in the hidden \n 16 \nlayer, or whether the anatomical distinction in the model alone accounted for the effect. \n \nSimulation 3: Effect of increasing resources \nArchitecture \nSimulation 3 was identical to Simulation 2, the disconnected hemispheres model, except \nthat we increased the hidden layer resources from 100 per side to 200.  \nTraining and testing \nThe model was trained and tested in the same way as in simulations 1 and 2. \nResults and discussion \nFigure 4 shows the model\u2019s performance on all words, exception words, and nonwords. \nAfter 10 million patterns, performance on the whole set of words was 92.3%, and \nnonword performance remained at a similar level as in the disconnected model with 100 \nhidden units, with 70.7% read appropriately. As predicted, exception word reading \nremained much poorer than reading of the whole word set, at 72.2% correct. Though \nincreasing resources resulted in greater accuracy compared with the 62.2% correct for the \ndisconnected model with 100 hidden units, it was still substantially lower than the 87.4% \ncorrect for the connected model. Hence, increasing resources did not qualitatively alter \nthe impaired hemispheric model\u2019s performance. Taken with the results of Simulations 1 \nand 2, the architectural principle underlying the surface dyslexia behaviour is relatively \nimpervious to parametric variations in resources for forming the mapping. The nature of \nthe linearly inseparable problem of reading exception words is unaffected by more \nresources, as the difficulty is due primarily to information not being integrated before the \n 17 \noutput stage. \nGeneral Discussion \n The range of studies demonstrating behavioural similarities between dyslexics \nand patients with callosal impairment, and the anatomical studies demonstrating \nmorphological aberrations in the corpus callosum of dyslexics, suggest that dyslexia and \nhemispheric dissociation are correlated. The computational modelling we have described \nprovides an explicit link between different levels of description and shows how a brain \nlevel impairment may cause a cognitive level impairment, going beyond simply \ndemonstrating a correlation. The computational models instantiated the informational \nconstraints on reading resulting from such impaired callosal transfer, which we have \ndemonstrated to be sufficient to cause surface dyslexia. \nThe quantitative results of the modelling have shown that impairments in transfer \nof information between the hemispheres during the mapping of orthography onto \nphonology is sufficient to affect to some degree performance on all words in the training \nset, to delay or prevent learning of exception words in particular, without also entailing a \nsubstantial reduction in accuracy of reading nonwords. This impairment does not happen \nwithin the phonological representations, but is due to problems in forming the mapping \nbetween written and spoken forms of words. Deficits within the phonological system \nitself may contribute additionally to dyslexic behaviour. Indeed, we have not attempted to \nprovide a model of phonological dyslexia. Within the same framework we have used for \nour modelling, impairments to the phonological attractors within the model have been \nshown to result in specific impairment to reading nonwords (Harm & Seidenberg, 1999) \nand our own model should be similarly extended.  \n 18 \nWe have, however, provided a detailed account of surface dyslexia, which, in \ncontrast to other connectionist models of surface dyslexia, is not a resource-based \naccount. Instead, the exception word reading impairment results from integration of \ninformation between the two hemispheres of the model at a stage too late in the pathway \nfrom orthography to phonology for effective integration of information. We have thus \nprovided an upper-bound on the point at which information about the word must interact \nwithin the reading system. If this interaction is inadequate or inefficient, then reading of \nexception words will be affected in particular, and general reading performance will be \nsomewhat reduced. Critically, such an account is not due to parametric differences in the \nmodel. Increasing resources in the left and right hidden layer of the model with no \n\u201ccallosal\u201d connections has no substantial impact on the pace of learning to read in the \nmodel, as indicated in Simulation 3.  \nWe created the hemispheric model within the connectionist tradition, adapting \nHarm and Seidenberg\u2019s (1999) model in order to inherit the broad range of reading \nphenomena which it produces. Our account differs in that we show how anatomical \npathways relevant to the reading system can provide additional constraints to capture \nreading impairments, and can \u2013 unlike Harm and Seidenberg\u2019s (1999) model \u2013 generate \npure cases of surface dyslexia. However, other traditions of modelling reading are also \ncompatible with the principles we have presented in our hemispheric model, and we \nmake no special case for the particular architecture we have used, but rather highlight the \nvalue of incorporating anatomical information as input to reading models. The DRC \nmodel of reading (Coltheart et al., 2001; Perry, Ziegler, & Zorzi, 2007) simulated surface \ndyslexia by impairing processing of the lexical route, and it is perfectly possible that the \n 19 \ninput to this system would be affected more substantially by impairments to unifying the \nleft and right visual information about the word, as compared with impairments to a \ngrapheme-phoneme correspondence system, where all information about the word does \nnot have to be available simultaneously in order to pronounce the word correctly. Our \nmodelling, therefore, provides insight into the influence of early stages of visual \nprocessing on the reading system, in particular, the requirement to integrate initially \ndivided visual information.  \nA consequence of inadequate transfer of information sufficiently early in the \northography to phonology mapping is that the RH of the model is implicated in \nphonological processing with some independence from the LH (Galaburda, et al., 1994). \nConsequently, the modelling predicts reduced activation in LH phonological processing \nand increased activation in the corresponding regions of the RH in dyslexics. This \nprediction is supported by imaging studies of reduced activity in the LH temporo-parietal \nand increased activity in the RH cortex of dyslexics (Brunswick, McCrory, Price, Fritch, \n& Frith, 1999; Horwitz, Rumsey, & Donohue, 1998; Paulesu et al., 1996; Pugh et al., \n2001; Rumsey et al., 1999; Shaywitz, Lyon, & Shaywitz, 2006; Temple et al., 2003).  \nThe model of surface dyslexia based on disconnected hemispheres does not \nnecessarily predict that dyslexics will experience no reading problems if words are \nprojected exclusively to one hemifield, such as the RVF. Normal word reading \noverwhelmingly involves parafoveal preview followed by fixation within the word, \nimplicating hemispheric storage and transfer and necessitating the appropriate partial \nrepresentations within each hemisphere, though the model\u2019s generalisation across \ndifferent presentation positions for the same word indicates that divided processing is a \n 20 \nfeature of lexical processing even when words are unilaterally presented (see Pollmann, \nZaidel, & von Cramon, 2004, for fMRI evidence of a similar effect in simple letter \nprocessing tasks). The brain typically operates best when able to bring the resources of \nboth hemispheres to bear on a problem (Weissman & Banich, 2000), and we have argued \nelsewhere (Shillcock et al., 2000) that aspects of normal reading behaviour can be \nunderstood in terms of ensuring an equitable division of labour between the two \nhemispheres. The limited data available \u2013 from the mean initial landing position on four-\nletter words in sentences (Kelly, Jones, McDonald, & Shillcock, 2004) \u2013 suggest that \nsome dyslexics may adopt reading behaviours that shift their fixation of a word slightly \nleftwards, thereby projecting more of the word to the LH, and reducing the need for \nhemispheric transmission of information. This behaviour was not a side-effect of more \nfixations for dyslexics, as no differences in the size of saccadic movements forward \nthrough the text were found between control and dyslexic readers.  \n It is one of the goals of cognitive neuroscientists to ground cognitive phenomena \nin the observable anatomical substrate of the brain. The division of the brain into two \nhemispheres is the largest anatomical distinction within the brain. We have made a first \nstep towards the goal by showing that this fundamental architectural distinction can be \nimplemented in computational models of reading, thereby effectively linking the brain-\nbased theory of dyslexia as hemispheric dissociation to disruption within the cognitive \nrepresentations involved in reading.\n 21 \nReferences \nAnnett, M.
