Introduction\nFiber-optic sensors are becoming increasingly more\nimportant, particularly in the field of chemical sens-\ning,1 because of the advantages they offer compared\nith conventional electrical sensors. The most obvi-\nus is their immunity to electromagnetic interference.\nowever, extremely high bandwidths, small size, the\nossibility of multiplexing several sensors for truly and\nuasi-distributed sensing, and the reduced risk of ig-\nition when sensing volatile species also make them\nttractive.\nFiber-optic chemical sensors that use evanescent ab-\nsorption techniques for such chemicals as methane gas\nhave been reported. In this type of sensor, one can\naccess part of the evanescent field guided by the fiber\nby reducing its diameter through heating and stretch-\ning2 or by using D-shaped fiber.3 A drawback is that\nthey are capable only of sensing chemical species that\nexhibit absorption at the wavelength of available laser\nsources. However, the fibers can be coated with ma-\nterials that, with a change in a particular optical prop-\nerty such as fluorescence,4 can be interrogated at a\nsuitable wavelength. In this way, many more chem-\nAll the authors are with the Centre for Photonics and Optical\nEngineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, Cranfield Univer-\nsity, Cranfield, Bedford MK43 OAL, UK.

One significant advantage\nto all evanescent-wave sensors is their fast response\nbut, inasmuch as only the light present in the evanes-\ncent field is used, their sensitivity can be limited.\nIn a previous publication5 we demonstrated a fiber-\noptic pH sensor by using a side-polished single-mode\noptical fiber evanescently coupled to a single-mode\nplanar waveguide overlay. Light is coupled from the\nfiber core into the overlay waveguide at a wavelength\nthat is dependent on the refractive index and the\nthickness of the overlay waveguide. If the overlay\nmaterial changes its refractive index in the presence\nof a chemical species, then the wavelength at which\nthe light is coupled into the overlay also changes. As\nmost of the light guided by the fiber is coupled into\nthe chemically sensitive overlay waveguide, such sen-\nsors exhibit a high sensitivity while retaining the fast\nresponse times associated with other evanescent-\nwave chemical sensors. Furthermore, as the mate-\nrials used to form the overlay waveguide are organic,\nit is possible to tailor the properties.\nHere the possibility of chemical sensing by use of\nsuch technology is investigated further. In particu-\nlar the use of a new chemical material, a substituted\nmerocyanine dye, has been used to form the\nLangmuir\u2013Blodgett ~LB! overlay. This gives\nimproved properties, for example, redshifting the ab-\nsorption maximum in such a way that the channel-\ndropping wavelength would shift further into the\ninfrared. The Kramers\u2013Kronig relations have been\nused successfully to model the nonlinear pH sensor\nresponse. This differs substantially from the origi-\nnal study in which the combination of material and\nwavelength resulted in a linear response.\ng\np\np\nt\nm\nt\nf\nw\ni\np\no\na\nt\np\ne\np\no\na\nc\nc\n102. Sensor Design\nThe chemical sensors reported in this paper are based\non a previously reported design for an in-line fiber-\noptic channel-dropping filter6 ~Fig. 1!. Such devices\nconsist of a side-polished single-mode optical fiber,\nevanescently coupled to a single-mode planar overlay\nwaveguide, deposited directly as a LB film onto the\npolished region of the fiber. Light is coupled from\nthe fiber core into the overlay at a particular coupling\nwavelength lm. This occurs when the two wave-\nuides, the fiber core and the planar overlay, become\nhase matched and can be calculated by inserting the\nhase-matching condition into the eigenvalue equa-\nion for the zeroth-order mode of a three-layer, asym-\netric, isotropic slab waveguide7:\n2pd\nlm\n~no\n2 2 neff\n2!1y2 5 Fs 1 Fcl, (1)\nwhere no is the overlay refractive index, neff is the\neffective refractive index of the fiber mode, d is the\nhickness of the overlay waveguide, and Fs and Fcl\nare polarization-dependent phase change terms at\nthe overlay-superstrate and overlay-fiber cladding\nboundaries, respectively. The dependence of the\ncoupling wavelength on the thickness and on the re-\nfractive index of the overlay material can be seen\nfrom Eq. ~1!.\nAfter the sensor has been fabricated, only the re-\nractive index of the overlay affects the coupling\navelength, but, as the overlay is being deposited, it\ns the thickness of the overlay that defines the cou-\nling wavelength. In practice, the thickness of the\nverlay is critical and therefore LB deposition is ide-\nlly suited because it allows extremely accurate con-\nrol. To polish the optical fiber, a small section of the\nrotective jacket ~;25 mm! is removed and some of\nthe exposed cladding is polished away by use of an\nannular polishing technique.8 The amount of clad-\nding removed is measured by an oil-drop test9 and is\nxpressed as a percentage drop in the transmitted\nower at a single wavelength when refractive-index\nil ~n 5 1.464! is added to the polished region. After\nfiber has been polished to the required depth, one\nan obtain the planar overlay waveguide of a suitable\nhemically sensitive material by LB deposition.\n3.

A fiber-optic state of\npolarization controller was used to ensure TM polar-\nization in the fiber as, from Eq. ~1!, the phase-matching\nwavelength is polarization dependent. We monitored\nthe transmission by using a photodiode and a lock-in\namplifier. With this system, it is possible to cease\ndeposition at an appropriate thickness for phase\nmatching at a given wavelength.\nA substituted merocyanine dye was used as the\nchemically sensitive overlay waveguide material\n~Fig. 3! because it is pH sensitive through the termi-\nnal oxygen atom that can be reversibly protonated.\nThe dye exhibits two distinct states, protonated and\nunprotonated, each of which has different absorption\nspectra ~Fig. 4!, resulting in a significant refractive-\nindex change after switching, the magnitude of the\nchange being dependent on the change in absorption.\nThe process is partially reversible when the film is\ninitially exposed to HCl and NH3, but when it is\nrepeatedly exposed the process reversibly changes\nbetween different intermediate states.\n4.

This\ngave the sensor a coupling wavelength of 900 nm\nwhich, when exposed to HCl vapor followed by NH3,\nshifted to 775 nm as shown in Fig. 5.\nWe positioned the sensor in a temperature-\ncontrolled test cell by using the experimental setup\nshown in Fig. 2. Solutions in 7-mL portions and\ndiffering in pH were successively introduced to the\ntest cell and allowed to reach a constant temperature\nof 25 6 0.05 \u00b0C. The lock-in amplifier time constant\nwas set at 100 ms to provide a steady signal, and the\nmonochromator was then stepped through a prede-\ntermined wavelength range at a rate of 0.4 nm s21.\nThe resulting fiber transmission was recorded on the\nlock-in amplifier at a sampling rate of 8 Hz and nor-\nmalized to the spectral characteristics of a length of\nunpolished optical fiber ~Fig. 6!.\nAs the sensor reported within this paper relies on\nchanges in refractive index of the overlay waveguide\nmaterial, we investigated its response by using a the-\noretical model based on the Kramers\u2013Kronig rela-\ntions, which is described in Section 5.\n5.

Furthermore, the extinction\ncoefficient for the material is related to the bulk ab-\nsorption coefficient a by\nni 5 aly4p. (5)\nThis can be calculated from the measured absorbance\n~A! and material thickness ~l ! by\na 5 log10~e!Ayl. (6)\nIt is now possible to calculate the refractive index of\nthe overlay material directly from its absorption spec-\ntrum at all wavelengths with Eqs. ~3!, ~5!, and ~6!.\nHowever, to perform the integration in Eq. ~3!, it is\nnecessary to describe the absorption spectrum as a\ncontinuous function. These were studied by fitting\nto Lorentzian and Gaussian functions and their com-\nbinations as commonly used in the field of molecular\nspectroscopy.12\nWe performed the fitting to the measured absorption\nspectra by using the graphics package Microcal Origin\n3D. The most appropriate fitting function for the\nspectra of the overlay material, when plotted in terms\nof wave numbers, consisted of the sum of two Gaussian\nfunctions. An example of an absorption spectrum\nand the fitted function can be seen in Fig. 7. The next\nstage in the modeling is to take the function generated\nFig. 6.

A\nthickness of 2 nm per layer was assumed and nr\u2018 was\nestimated as 1.4. The integral in Eq. ~3! was then\ncalculated to give the real part of the refractive index\nas a function of wave number. To simplify the inte-\ngral in Eq. ~3! it was noted that the function sy~s2 2 n2!\ndecays rapidly to either side of the wave number s. In\nact it was found that this function contributed no\nignificant part to the integral at wave numbers be-\nond 9000 cm21 either side of s for all the values of s\nsed in the following model. We used 30,000 points\nor numerical evaluation of the integral13 with 100-\ncm21 steps in the wave number. A plot of the fitted\nfunction, shown in Fig. 7, along with the resultant\nrefractive-index plot from the modeling can be seen in\nFig. 8. The refractive index rises sharply close to the\nabsorption maximum while going through the well-\nknown anomalous dispersion regime.\nTo model the effect of the refractive-index changes\nthat are due to pH, the spectra of a 50-layer LB film\non a planar substrate were investigated ~Fig. 9!.\nhe glass slide was exposed to HCl vapor and then\naussian functions were fitted to the measured ab-\norption spectra. We calculated the refractive index\nf the LB film as a function of wavelength by using\nhe thickness of 2 nm per layer ~Fig. 10!. Note that\nhe results shown in Fig. 10 are refractive-index\nhanges as opposed to an absolute value because nr\u20182is not known accurately. However it is possible to\npredict the changes in sensor coupling wavelength.\nTo predict the shifts in sensor coupling wavelength\nunder the conditions described, it is necessary to an-\nalyze the sensor\u2019s coupled waveguide structure.\nCoupling between the two waveguides occurs when\nthe effective refractive index of the overlay guided\nmode equals that of the optical fiber mode. The ef-\nfective refractive index of the former depends not only\non the refractive index of the overlay material but\nalso on the refractive index of the ammonia solution.\nFurthermore, with such asymmetric, thin planar\nwaveguides, waveguide dispersion is also an impor-\ntant factor. To analyze this complex structure, we\nused a numerical model based on the transfer matrix\napproach for the study of multilayer thin-film struc-\ntures developed by Ghatak et al.14 This allows for\nthe calculation of effective refractive indices of bound\nmodes within complex dielectric waveguides.\nTo calculate the wavelength at which the overlay\nbecomes phase matched to the optical fiber it is neces-\nsary to model the dispersion within each waveguide\nseparately. As mentioned above, the refractive index\nof the ammonia solution affects the dispersion of the\noverlay waveguide. Therefore it is necessary to mea-\nsure its refractive index as a function of the pH by use\nof an Abbe\u00b4 refractometer illuminated by a tunable Ti:\nsapphire laser, the results of which can be seen in Fig.\n11. From these results, coupled with the material\ndispersion results shown in Fig. 10, it is possible toFig. 7.

Phase matching occurs when the\ndispersion curve at a given pH value crosses that of the\noptical fiber, and these wavelengths can easily be ob-\ntained from Fig. 12. A plot of predicted phase-\nmatching wavelengths, along with the experimental\nresults shown in Fig. 6, can be seen in Fig. 13. It\nshould be noted that, to predict the phase-matching\nwavelength of the sensor, it is necessary to have an\nabsolute value of the overlay material refractive index\nas opposed to the relative changes shown in Fig. 10.\nWe obtained this absolute value by calculating the374 APPLIED OPTICS y Vol. 38, No. 36 y 20 December 1999refractive index required for phase matching at 745\nnm corresponding to the sensor response to an ammo-\nnia solution of pH 11.6. After we made the calcula-\ntions it was possible to obtain absolute refractive-index\nvalues corresponding to exposure of the overlay mate-\nrial to the pH values shown in Fig. 10.\n6. Conclusions\nA fiber-optic chemical sensor based on a side-polished\nsingle-mode optical fiber, evanescently coupled to a\nchemically sensitive overlay planar waveguide, has\nbeen demonstrated as a pH sensor. LB deposition\nhas been shown to be an excellent technique for the\nformation of an overlay waveguide because it allows\nfor fine thickness control. Furthermore, inasmuch\nas the materials that form the overlay are organic\ndyes, it might be possible to tailor the response of the\nmaterials for specific purposes. Finally, a theoreti-\ncal model based on Kramers\u2013Kronig relations has\nbeen developed that allows the response of the sensor\nto be predicted and that has shown good agreement\nwith the nonlinear experimental results.\nReferences\n1.
