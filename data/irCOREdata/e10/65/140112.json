However, is this approach being adopted in Germany as fast as it has in the UK? This\npaper describes research that answers this question and investigates how German companies are\nmanaging contacts with their suppliers. The research was conducted in two stages. Firstly, a postal\nsurvey of German and UK manufacturers identified the supplier base trends. Secondly, a follow-up\ntelephone survey of a random sample of German plants investigated supplier management processes.\nThe findings show that German manufacturers have not reduced their supplier base by as much as\ntheir UK counterparts. However, German manufacturers that have reduced their supplier base\nperceive significant benefits. Currently, many companies appear to have failed to recognise the\npotential of working with a reduced supplier base.\nIntroduction\nThe management of supplier relationships is a vital task for manufacturers as it can contribute to\nboth the competitiveness and profitability of a company. This is because supplier management is\nconcerned with \u201corganising the optimal flow of high-quality, value-for-money materials or\ncomponents to manufacturing companies from a suitable set of innovative suppliers\u201d [1, p. 422].\nEffective supplier management starts with the selection of the most appropriate suppliers, using\ncriteria such as \u2018providing high quality parts,\u2019 \u2018aggressive pricing\u2019 and \u2018reliable delivery.\u2019\nPage 2\nInterestingly, many companies have found that it is advantageous to have a smaller supplier base\n[2,3,4], because fewer suppliers enables manufacturers to achieve volume discounts, reduce\nadministration costs, improve quality, and co-operate on product development. There is much\nanecdotal evidence of the advantages of supply base reduction and some empirical studies have\nconfirmed this phenomenon in the UK (for example, [1,5]). However, very little empirical research\nhas been conducted in Germany. This is somewhat surprising, because the importance of supplier\nmanagement to German companies has long been recognised ([6]). Therefore, this paper addresses\nthis omission and presents an empirical investigation of supplier management in German\nmanufacturing companies, contrasted with corresponding practices in the UK. The main aims of the\ncurrent research are:\n\u2022 To investigate the supplier base trends of German manufacturers compared to UK companies;\n\u2022 To explore the views of German managers on supplier management.\nSupplier Management\nSupplier management is a key aspect of supply chain management (SCM). The scope of SCM\n\u201cbegins with the source of supply and ends at the point of consumption\u201d [7, p. 3). Accordingly, SCM\nis \u201cthe management of upstream and downstream relationships with suppliers and customers to\ndeliver superior customer value at less cost to the supply chain as a whole,\u201d [8, p. 18]. Supplier\nmanagement \u2013 the upstream relationships \u2013 is a key area for most manufacturers, as it can have a\nsignificant impact on a company\u2019s costs, its quality, innovation and its competitive position.\nThe literature review presented in this paper will focus on supplier management. From the\narticles published in English, three main areas emerge: the importance of supplier management;\nsupplier base reduction; and the selection of suppliers. Each of these will be described separately\nbefore moving on to cover the German literature.\nPage 3\nThe Importance of Supplier Management\nSuppliers play a vital role in helping manufacturers to achieve high performance and this has\nbecome widely recognised over the past few years. For example, a survey by Monczka et al. [9]\nshowed that whilst in 1995 20% of purchasing and materials managers deemed supplier\nmanagement to be \u2018extremely important\u2019, 65% of them expected it to be exceptionally important by\n1997. Why is this the case?\nEffective supplier management can take costs out of the supply chain [10]. In many industries,\nthe management of suppliers can account for as much as 60% and 80% of manufacturing costs [11].\nOther potential benefits include on-going improvements in product and service quality by employing\njust-in-time delivery systems [8], electronic data interchange [12] and quality improvement\nprogrammes [13]. Furthermore, involving selected suppliers in new product development can\nenhance product and process design [14]. Finally, a streamlined supplier base allows partnerships to\nbe formed with the remaining suppliers. Companies, which develop better communication links with\ntheir suppliers, achieve better results [15]. Conversely, if the supplier base is too large, co-ordination\nand interaction becomes costly, time consuming and inefficient.\nSupplier Base Reduction\nThe term \u2018supplier base\u2019 describes the total number of selected suppliers [1,9]. One of the key\ntrends in recent years has been for manufacturers to reduce their total number of suppliers\n[1,8,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. There is a fair degree of anecdotal evidence to support this view. For\nexample, Sheth and Sharma [18] reported that a number of major manufacturers in the USA have\nreduced their supplier base, including Motorola (cut by 44%) and Xerox (90% reduction). However,\nPage 4\nSheth and Sharma did not identify the time-scale over which the change in supplier numbers\noccurred and the figure might well include double counting (a point raised by Lamming [19]).\nReviewing the literature, it becomes obvious that empirical evidence for the reduction in the\nsupplier base is rare \u2013 and where it does exist, it comes mostly from the automotive sector. For\nexample, Asmus and Griffin [11] report that \u2018world-class\u2019 manufacturers in the automotive sector\nhave reduced their supplier base typically by 50% and have moved to single-sourcing (one supplier\nper part). In contrast, \u2018traditional\u2019 companies have made only small reductions. However, this\nresearch was conducted by consultants who did not specify the sources of the data and the sample\nsize. Therefore, this study must be classed as anecdotal evidence only.\nIn contrast, Goffin et al. [1] made an empirical investigation of supplier base reduction \u2013 the first\noutside the automotive sector. This research was based on a survey of about 200 companies in four\nindustrial sectors in the UK (process, engineering, electronics, and household; see Appendix 1 for\ndetails). They found that in process, engineering and electronics sectors the supplier base was\nstreamlined by around 35% between 1991-95. However, the household industry showed a relatively\nlow reduction of 9%.\nFinally, Cousins\u2019s [24] recent survey research in medium and large-sized UK companies is worth\nmentioning. The first part of the study aimed to identify whether strategies to \u2018rationalise\u2019 the supply\nbases are in place. The research did not focus on specific industry sectors and Cousins (ibid.: 147)\nsummarised saying \u201call of the respondents indicated that they were either undertaking or about to\nundertake a supplier reduction process, with 77% already actively pursuing such an approach and the\nremaining 23% either considering or about to embark on the exercise.\u201d Streamlining the supply base\nhas thus developed into a key trend in British industry.\nPage 5\nThe Selection Process\nThe selection process is strongly tied to the evaluation of a supplier\u2019s performance [25,26,27].\nTraditionally, three measures have been used for determining supplier performance: price, delivery\nand quality [28]. These are also the factors typically applied in supplier selection [29], although\nservice, as a fourth dimension, has for some years been used as an additional selection criterion [30].\nManufacturers in the UK automotive sector, however, have recently put great pressure on their\nsuppliers to reduce their prices. This brings into question the suitability of the partnership approach\nand suggests that a return to traditional supplier management practices is becoming apparent in the\nUK [31]. Therefore, the automotive sector appears to have come \u2018full-circle\u2019.\nTaking a broader view, it has been argued that focusing mainly on price is inappropriate as it is\n\u201cperhaps one of the most defined characteristics of primitive purchasing\u201d [19, p. 148]. Lamming did\nnot suggest that price is unimportant, but the relative emphasis between the four factors (i.e., price,\ndelivery, quality, service) has changed over time. For example, Wilson\u2019s [32] research in the US\nshowed that the rankings of the criteria are: (1) quality, (2) service, (3) price and (4) delivery. In\naddition, other factors are now becoming important. For example, one study in the US automotive\nindustry identified 26 criteria on which supplier selection is commonly based [33]. These included 4\n\u2018soft\u2019 relationship factors1 as well as 22 \u2018hard\u2019 quantitative criteria. The study was based on a postal\nsurvey of 156 purchasing managers. The results clearly showed not only the influence of \u2018soft\u2019\ncriteria, but also the reduced importance of price (which was given a low ranking).\nJust as the role of price has diminished as a criterion in supplier selection in many sectors, so\nquality has become a more important factor. Quality no longer simply applies to the product itself\nbut also to the service and other aspects of the supplier-manufacturer relationship. For instance, a\ngood relationship is a prerequisite to good problem solving and co-operation in product design. In\nPage 6\nthe drive to reduce the number of suppliers, the location of the vendor also plays a role. Supplier\nlocation can impact on the costs of transportation and response time for replacement orders. Another\nmotivation might be to support the local or national economy and manufacturers may choose to buy\nlocally, rather than overseas [34]. The newer, wider spectrum of selection criteria incorporates\nseveral intangible factors. Choi and Hartley\u2019s [33] study suggested that the supplier selection process\nneeds to be modified in order to account for the intangible side of the relationship. However, the\nquestion arises: how can intangible aspects, which are difficult to measure, be integrated into the\ndecision process?\nDe Boer [35] argued that supplier selection involving intangible factors is best managed by a\ngroup of decision makers. A cross-functional sourcing team usually consists of individuals who are\nknowledgeable about the particular selection decision to be made [1,9]. Hence, the team membership\nchanges according to the selection problem. The purchasing manager, however, is always part of the\nteam and they should take up the role of \u2018coach\u2019. The team approach should prevent purely\nsubjective (ad-hoc) decisions being made, at the same time, it allows for a degree of flexibility.\nNevertheless, the best way to deal with soft factors in supplier selection decisions is still an open\nissue [3].\nIt appears from the literature that the structure of the sourcing team as well as the criteria used\nfor selecting suppliers is changing. This is in response to the new challenge of selecting suppliers\nwho have the potential to add long-term value to a manufacturer.\n1 The following \u2018soft\u2019 factors were chosen: closeness of past relationship, likelihood of long-term relationship, communication\nopenness and company\u2019s reputation for integrity.\nPage 7\nGerman Literature\nIt has been recognised that German manufacturing is comparatively slow at adopting new\nmanufacturing concepts, such as lean production and business process re-engineering [36,37]. It\ncould also be assumed that supplier management are also being adopted very slowly.\nReviewing the literature published in the German language, it quickly becomes apparent that\nmost ideas are repeated from English publications and are conceptual in nature. It has to be noted\nthat some empirical studies conducted in Germany have been published in English. These have\nfocused on exploring the best practices of successful companies and have identified supplier\nmanagement as a key area (e.g., [38, 39]). It is surprising that few authors have conducted empirical\ninvestigations in Germany. In order to contrast German research to the English literature given\nabove, a brief summary of key German publications will be presented following the same headings\nused previously.\nThe Importance of Supplier Management\nMany German writers have acknowledged the importance of supplier management (e.g., [40,41,42])\nand today, close supplier relationships are an emerging critical success factor (e.g., [43,44,45]).\nHowever, in discussing German manufacturing industry as a whole, Friedrich et al. [46] identified\nthat partnerships between suppliers and manufacturers are unusual and that adversarial relationships\nare too common.\nRecently, a German Delphi-Panel of experts made the prognosis for the years 2001-2005 that\nsuppliers will become responsible for a major part of R&D activities, whereas manufacturers will\npredominantly focus on their core competencies [47]. Thus, supplier management becomes\nincreasingly critical.\nPage 8\nSupplier Base Reduction\nHomburg\u2019s [40] study of 5 industry sectors (see Table 1) is particularly relevant, as it is the only\nprevious empirical investigation of supplier base trends. The investigation was based on a 1993\npostal survey of 165 manufacturing companies. The results indicated that the majority of German\nmanufacturers intended to maintain their supplier base (77% on average across all sectors).\nPLACE TABLE 1 HERE\nIt is unfortunate, that Homburg only determined the average number of suppliers in 1993. This\nprompts the question of whether manufacturers had reduced their supplier bases prior to 1993 and\nintended therefore to keep supplier numbers stable. Therefore, another study is required.\nThe Supplier Selection Process\nThe selection process is not normally the responsibility of one individual (e.g., purchasing manager),\nbut a group of decision makers. Whereas some authors argued that the purchasing manager has to\nteam up with engineers for selecting suppliers (e.g., [48,49]), other authors argued for a cross-\nfunctional team approach (e.g., [41]), making decisions using well-established selection criteria such\nas price, quality, delivery and service ([50,51]).\nFr\u00f6hlich-Glantschnig [52] argued that the selection process should only be based on objective\ncriteria. In contrast, some authors have called for the use of \u2018soft\u2019 criteria [41]. Moreover, a small\ngroup of authors have seriously considered the quality of relationship as a potential selection\nPage 9\ncriterion [42,53]. Unfortunately, the concept quality of relationship has not been clearly defined,\nalthough it may well often be more important than price (e.g., [54]).\nConclusions on the Literature\nIn contrasting the published literature in English to the German it becomes evident that the\noverwhelming majority of German authors base their arguments on anecdotal evidence alone. The\nlack of empirical investigations is surprising, considering the interest in supplier management. The\nreview of the literature leads to four main conclusions and questions:\n1. Although a smaller supplier base can lead to competitive advantages, the typical size of the\nsupplier base of German manufacturers is not clear. What is the trend in the size of the supplier\nbase for German manufacturers?\n2. There is a lack of empirical work on whether German managers perceive supplier management\nto be important today. Is there a mismatch between theory, which advocates that the management\nof suppliers is crucial, and practice?\n3. Usually, it is argued that a variety of benefits result from dealing with a smaller supplier base.\nWhat are the specific advantages of working with a limited number of suppliers?\n4. A cross-functional sourcing team is typically responsible for selecting suppliers. However, are\nsuch teams being used by German manufacturers (and what are the typical steps taken in the\nselection process and what are the latest selection criteria)?\nThe conclusions from the literature and the questions here raised prompted an empirical\ninvestigation of supplier management in German manufacturing industry, contrasted against\npractices in the UK.\nPage 10\nResearch Design\nThe goals of the research were:\n1. To determine the trends of the size of the supplier base of German manufacturing companies and\nto contrast the results with findings of comparable UK companies.\n2. To investigate into the importance of supplier management to German managers.\n3. To explore the benefits of a reduced supplier base.\n4. To investigate in detail the supplier selection process in German manufacturing.\nTo achieve the above aims, the methodology of Goffin et al. [1] was extended and refined. This\nled to the adoption of two stages for the research: a postal survey followed by a telephone survey of\nmanagers involved in supplier management. The combination of postal survey and telephone\ninterviews was used to establish the trend in supplier management in the two countries and also to\nobtain an understanding of supplier management practice in Germany.\nStage 1 \u2013 Postal Survey of German and UK Manufacturing Companies\nResearch Instrument and Survey Details\nThe research used information taken from the Best Factory Awards (BFA) database of UK\nmanufacturing companies. Management Today (a leading UK manufacturing magazine) and\nCranfield School of Management have run the BFA programme since 1992. The data collected from\nmore than 200 manufacturing plants each year are used for benchmarking and research (for detailed\ninformation about the programme refer to [55]). Each plant completes a detailed 16-page,\nconfidential questionnaire covering descriptive data (e.g., cost structure), performance data (e.g.,\ndelivery reliability), the products manufactured as well as management policies (e.g., market\nPage 11\npositioning), beside other issues. Currently, the UK-database contains high-quality data on the\nperformance of over 1,000 manufacturing plants, including details of their supplier management.\nPrevious Best Factory Award winners and finalists have been widely publicised (see, for example\nWheatley et al. [20, 21, 56]). To enable international comparisons, the Best Factory Awards\nDeutschland (IBFA-D) database was launched in 1996. The German database now contains\ncomparable data on manufacturing organisations in terms of industry sector, product range, size,\nemployee number etc. [57, 58].\nPurpose and Sample\nAs most research dealing with supplier management has been conducted in the automotive sector,\nthe current research takes a broader sample and extends beyond this industry (as did the UK-study by\nGoffin et al. [1]). The research examines the issue of supplier management in three industry sectors:\nengineering (including automotive), process, and electronics.\nThe performance of 220 manufacturing companies (110 German; 110 English) in the selected\nindustry sectors was analysed using the BFA databases. Furthermore, information on supplier\nmanagement including trends in the size of supplier bases was compared. Therefore, it was possible\nto establish whether manufacturers in both countries reduced their supplier bases between 1993 and\n1997 (Appendix 2 specifies the survey questions used).\nStage 2 \u2013 Telephone Survey of German Manufacturing Companies\nThe second stage of the research focused on supplier management exclusively in Germany. The\ntelephone survey was necessary in order to be able to investigate some of the more complex aspects\nof supplier management, which could not be effectively studied using a postal survey.\nPage 12\nResearch Instrument and Interview Details\nThe telephone questionnaire used was based on the one developed by Goffin et al. [1]. It was\ntranslated into German by a native speaker (one of the researchers) and was checked by an\nindependent German expert in the supplier management field. Five pilot interviews were conducted\nin order to check and optimise the questionnaire. They also helped to affirm that the interview\nstructure, the individual questions, as well as the overall interview flow were relevant and applicable\nto German manufacturers.\nOne individual researcher conducted all interviews (including pilots) in his native language - in\norder to avoid possible errors resulting from multiple interviewers. Since the interviews were\nexploratory in nature, recording the conversation on tape was beneficial [59]. The interviews took 30\nminutes on average and followed a structured questionnaire. Full transcripts of the interviews were\nproduced and used in the analysis.\nPurpose and Sample\nA random stratified sample for the telephone survey was selected from the 110 German plants that\nentered the BFA in 1997 (i.e., from the German respondents to the Stage 1 survey). The sample was\nstratified by the three sectors. This approach ensured that a representative sample from the three\nindustrial sectors was used for the telephone survey. The managers interviewed were senior\npurchasing\/materials management managers with responsibility for supplier chain management.\nThe questionnaire used in Stage 2 was developed from one used for face-to-face interviews\nby the same group of researchers previously mentioned [1]. The original questionnaire had been\npiloted, and its reliability and validity established but modifications were necessary before it could\nPage 13\nbe used for telephone interviews. Five pilot interviews were used to verify the utility of the\ntelephone questionnaire. The random stratified sample (of 34 interviews) consisted of 21\nengineering companies, 9 electronics companies and 4 process companies. Note that as the 34\ncompanies covered by the telephone survey had already completed the BFA questionnaire, full\nbackground data on their manufacturing operations and performance were available prior to the\ninterviews.\nResults\nThe discussion of the results starts by examining the survey data taken from the UK and German\nBFA databases. It then moves on to examine the results of the telephone survey.\nPostal Survey Results\nThe shifts in the number of suppliers between the years 1993 and 1997 for UK and German\nmanufacturing plants are shown in Table 2 (derived from the BFA databases).\nPLACE TABLE 2 HERE\nThe table compares the average supplier bases across three industry sectors. In the electronics\nsector, UK plants have reduced their number of suppliers from 1993 to 1997 by 46%. In contrast,\nGerman plants have only reduced the supplier number by 8% over the same period \u2013 leaving them\nwith, on average, twice as many suppliers (532 versus 253).\nA similar trend to that seen in the electronics sector can also be observed in engineering. UK\nmanufacturers have reduced the average supplier number of 243 in 1993 to around 155 in 1997. This\nPage 14\nrepresents a 36% decrease over 4 years. In the same period comparable German plants reduced their\nsupplier base by only 5% (from 240 in 1993 to 228 in 1997).\nHowever, the third sector, process, shows a different situation. Whereas UK manufacturers\nreduced their average supplier base from 332 (in 1993) to 260 (in 1997), the German plants actually\nincreased their supply bases from 124 to 143 over the same period.\nThe results indicate that UK electronics and engineering plants have greatly reduced their\nsupplier base whilst German plants made much smaller changes. However, the question arises: were\nthe manufacturing plants in the UK and German samples comparable? In order to verify this, a range\nof variables from other parts of the questionnaire was checked. These included plant size, types of\nproduct, product complexity, number of employees, etc. As presented in a previous paper, no\nsignificant differences between the UK and German plants were found on any of these variables (see\n[57]).\nTelephone Survey Results\nThe Importance of Supplier Management\nThe respondents were asked if they considered the importance of supplier management to have\nincreased over the last 3 to 5 years. Around 79% of managers saw the importance of supplier\nmanagement to have increased. However, a sizeable minority of 21% perceived the importance of\nsupplier management as stable, while none of the managers perceived supplier management as\ndecreasing in importance. Commenting on the important of supplier management, one interviewee\nsaid \u201cpurchasing is not a single-sided business but is underpinned by a bilateral supplier-customer\nrelationship,\u201d (purchasing manager - engineering sector). Similarly, a central purchasing manager\nfrom the electronics sector stated \u201cwe are only as good as our suppliers.\u201d These quotes demonstrate\nPage 15\nthe typical views of managers on the significance of supplier management.\nFurther Supplier Base Reduction\nThe respondents were asked about the future development of their supplier numbers; Table 3 shows\ntheir answers.\nPLACE TABLE 3 HERE\nAlthough some of the respondents intend to reduce the number of suppliers, the majority plans to\nkeep the number stable. Companies in the \u2018process\u2019 sector largely intend to keep the number\nconstant, whereas a greater proportion of the companies in the \u2018electronics\u2019 and \u2018engineering\u2019\nindustrial sectors intend to reduce. It is interesting to note that of the 14 companies, who intend to\nstreamline the supply base in the future, 12 (ca. 85%) had already reduced their supplier number in\nthe period 1993-97. This suggests that supplier base reduction is an ongoing process.\nBenefits of Reduced Supplier Base\nIn total, 15 of the 34 manufacturers surveyed had reduced their supplier base in the period 1993 to\n1997. These respondents were asked about the benefits of reducing their supplier base \u2013 Table 4\npresents their answers.\nPLACE TABLE 4 HERE\nPage 16\nThe benefits identified by respondents were mostly related to the cost savings resulting from a\nsmaller supplier base. In addition, managers said that the focus on fewer suppliers increased their\nnegotiating power with their remaining suppliers. Respondents were also asked whether their\norganisations quantitatively monitored the advantages of a smaller supplier base. In fact, only 7\nrespondents\u2019 companies had quantified the benefits to some extent. Hence, for the majority of\nmanagers, the benefits of a smaller supplier base were \u2018perceived\u2019 rather than being based on, for\nexample, clear financial evidence. Interestingly, Cousins [24] found similar results in the UK\nrecently. He identified that managers did not have accurate cost information for measuring the\nadvantages; they simply felt that a smaller supplier base was more efficient. The current study and\nthe work of Cousins both indicate that managers believe that it is economically sound to reduce the\nsupplier base but often fail to monitor this adequately.\nSupplier Selection and Criteria\nAll the respondents were asked about their supplier selection process. Almost every respondent\ndescribed the selection process as a team effort, involving a number of different functions. Table 5\noutlines the main functions involved in the supplier selection process at the 34 companies surveyed.\nPLACE TABLE 5 HERE\nIn 79% of cases, the purchasing department was involved, followed by quality management and\nresearch & development. Normally, three functions make up the team responsible for supplier\nselection. Surprisingly, of the 34 firms surveyed, only two manufacturers integrate the marketing\nfunction into the sourcing teams. Recently, Homburg et al.\u2019s [61] empirical work on German and US\nPage 17\nmanufacturing indicated that marketing is normally active in its classical role (i.e. promotion and\ncustomer contact) but is not highly involved with suppliers. This, together with the results of the\ncurrent investigation, suggests that marketing take a predominately downstream view of the supply\nchain. In other words, while marketing is actively involved in managing the manufacturer-customer\nrelationship, it is not involved in managing the supplier-manufacturer interface in Germany.\nEach of the companies was asked about their supplier selection processes and the typical stages\nwere identified. Although, individual procedures varied to some extent, they can be aggregated into\nthe main nine steps outlined in Table 6.\nPLACE TABLE 6 HERE\nThe selection procedure starts with an initial requirement for a part or component, or a specific\ncustomer order. The purchasing manager then identifies potential suppliers and initiates the bidding\nprocess. The sourcing team discusses the options on the basis of the information received before\ninviting a limited number of suppliers for further personal discussions. After drawing up a short-list,\nsuppliers are asked to deliver samples, which the quality manager subsequently evaluates. Then the\npurchasing manager negotiates the price and delivery conditions, etc. Sometimes it is necessary to\nconduct supplier audits before entering the final phase. Here, the sourcing team decides on which\nsupplier(s) to buy from and the purchasing manager places the order(s).\nThe telephone survey was used to clarify which criteria form the basis for selecting suppliers.\nThirty respondents mentioned price, whereas 27 managers referred to product quality and 23 to\ndelivery performance. Other criteria were mentioned somewhat infrequently, as shown in Table 7.\nPLACE TABLE 7 HERE\nPage 18\nThe top three selection criteria identified are the same as those advocated by the German literature.\nAlthough the manufacturers interviewed did not mention the location of the supplier, it might be that\nis a pre-requisite. Suitable supplier locations ensure speedy delivery, make direct communication\neasier.\nIn general, some German companies surveyed favoured a combination of price and quality while\nothers used price and delivery for supplier evaluation purposes. The majority, however, took all\nthree factors into account when selecting a supplier. This shows that price always plays a role in\nselecting suppliers, although it has to be emphasised that this factor is not the single most important\ncriterion. A purchasing manager from the electronics industry summarised the situation as follows\n\u201cin the past, the price was the most important and then quality came in. Yet, if the quality is not\nright or we do not get the promised component delivered, a \u2018good price\u2019 will not help us run our\nbusiness.\u201d\nThe change in the relative importance of the selection criteria confirms a trend already observed\nin America [32]. In the US, quality initially replaced price as the most important criteria before\nwider aspects of the supplier-manufacturer relationship were adopted into the decision process (cf.\n[33]). In the future, will German manufacturing follow the US in adopting \u201csofter\u201d relationship\ncriteria into account when selecting suppliers?\nThe current investigation cannot answer this question, but it became apparent that softer issues,\nsuch as cultural fit or problem solving capabilities, are only rarely considered in the selection\ndecision in German manufacturing today.\nPage 19\nSummary and Conclusions\nIt is evident from the literature that supplier management is critical to manufacturers today and likely\nto remain so for some time to come. The empirical results identified a sharp contrast between UK\nmanufacturers in the electronics and engineering sectors, which had significantly reduced their\nsupplier bases and many German companies which had not. Previous research by Homburg [40]\nindicated that German manufacturers expected their supplier base to stay unchanged in the future.\nThe empirical evidence from the present study goes beyond Homburg\u2019s investigation and shows that\nmany manufacturers are planning to reduce their supplier base in the near future.\nManagers at the companies that have reduced their supplier base, perceive significant advantages\nto this approach. These include a range of cost reductions and the benefits resulting from closer\nmanufacturer-supplier relationships. However, very few companies have actually used measures to\nmonitor the benefits gained.\nThe research showed that the classical selection criteria (price, quality and delivery) are still the\nmost popular ones for selecting suppliers in Germany. The process of selection itself typically starts\nwith a requirement from an in-house technical department, or from a specific customer order. Then\nthe purchasing manager obtains offers from potential suppliers and the procedure continues with\nvarious evaluation stages. Finally, a cross-functional sourcing team selects the most suitable\nsupplier(s).\nThe findings have implications for researchers, who need to collect more empirical evidence on\nsupplier management in Germany. For example, it is necessary to understand why some\nmanufacturers have reduced their supplier numbers, although most have not. A case study approach\nwould probably be the most appropriate methodology for exploring this issue and this could be done\nin the sectors discussed in this paper, as well as other industries. Some related questions also require\nfurther research: what is the appropriate strategy for suppliers to differentiate themselves from their\nPage 20\ncompetitors? Similarly, do subjective \u201csoft\u201d factors about supplier-manufacturer influence the\nsupplier selection process, or is it all based on objective quantitative criteria?\nThe results of the research have strong ramifications for manufacturers \u2013 they indicate that many\nGerman companies have yet to take advantage of a reduced supplier base. In addition, for companies\nstarting to reduce their supplier base need to put measures in place to identify the real, as opposed to\nperceived, business advantages. This would also provide important data for companies considering\nsupplier base reduction \u2013 it would give them a clear view of potential savings.\nHowever, the findings are not only relevant to manufacturers, they also have implications for\nsuppliers. If more German manufacturers decide to reduce their supplier base, then suppliers need to\nensure that the combination of materials, parts, components and services they offer is attractive to\nmanufacturers. Consequently, suppliers need to hone their competitive strategy accordingly.\nCurrently there is a very strong debate about the international competitiveness of German\nmanufacturing industry (e.g., [37,62]) and this topic became generally known as the Standort\nDeutschland (Germany as a viable location for manufacturing) discussion (see, for example,\n[63][64]). The degree to which Standort Deutschland has been debated in the press is demonstrated\nby the fact that in the past three years well over 1,000 articles on this issue were published in two\nleading German newspapers, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung2.\nGermany has a substantial manufacturing industry, accounting for 25% of Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) as well as employing an equally high rate of the workforce in this sector (65). However, high\ntaxes and labour costs are leading some companies to question the viability of producing in Germany\n[66]. Some researchers have noted that best practices, such as \u2018lean production\u2019 could help\ncompanies reduce the cost of manufacturing in Germany. Surprisingly, however, such management\nconcepts have only been slowly adopted by German industry [36,37]. It appears that supplier base\n2 As determined by a search of the Financial Times FTProfile database.\nPage 21\nmanagement is another concept that is only being slowly adopted. It will be interesting to see how\nlong it takes before more German manufacturers recognise that fewer suppliers can mean more\neffective supplier base management.\nReferences\n[1] Goffin, Keith, Marek Szwejczewski and Colin New, \u201cManaging Suppliers: When Fewer Can Mean More,\u201d\nInternational Journal of Physical Distributions & Logistics Management, Vol. 27, No. 7 (1997), pp. 422-436.\n[2] Christopher, Martin and Uta J\u00fcttner, \u201cDeveloping Strategic Partnerships in the Supply Chain,\u201d Paper Presented\nat \"The Second Worldwide Research Symposium on Purchasing and Supply Chain Management.\" London, England,\n01.-03.
