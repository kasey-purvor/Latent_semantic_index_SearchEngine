Known as the NHS Cervical Screening Programme (NHSCSP), \nit is organised and delivered through primary care.  Cervical screening is available free-of-\ncharge to women in England aged between 25 and 64 years; invitations are issued every \nthree or five years depending on the woman\u2019s age. The three other countries of the UK \n(Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) have slightly different arrangements regarding \neligibility and screening intervals for the programme. Enclosed with all invitations to \nparticipate in the programme is the NHSCSP information leaflet, which describes the \nscreening test as a straightforward procedure where the main risk is that \u201cyou might \nexperience some discomfort or pain\u201d.  \nAttitudes towards cervical screening remain something of a paradox. On one hand, the \nprogramme appears to command impressive levels of public support; campaigns to widen \nthe eligibility criteria for the programme (and in particular to lower the age of first \ninvitation) are often high profile and widely supported. They include those following the \ndeath from cervical cancer of the British celebrity Jade Goody at the age of 27 in 2009 and \nof 23-year old Claire Allan in the same year. 1  Public pressure to widen the age criteria \npersisted following a review by the Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening, which agreed \nunanimously there should be no change to the current policy. 2  \nTension between public support for the screening programme in principle and individual \nwomen\u2019s experiences is, however, evident. Considerable evidence suggests that individual \nwomen find the experience of the screening test problematic. An invasive procedure, it \n4 \n \ninvolves opening the vagina via the use of a speculum, and taking a sample of cells from the \ncervix.   It violates important taboos about access to intimate body parts and nakedness. 3 \nReported concerns among women include fear, dislike of the procedure, anticipated \nembarrassment, possible pain or discomfort, 4 5 6 7 8  9 and anxieties about being treated in \nan uncaring or disrespectful way. 10   \nPrimary care professionals who conduct the test may have an important mediating role, in \nparticular by reducing any gap between public enthusiasm for the program and women\u2019s \nprivate experiences.  However, surprisingly little is known about the role of primary care \npractitioners in managing women\u2019s personal engagement with cervical screening.  In this \npaper, we explore this drawing on Erving Goffman\u2019s work on the \u201cinteraction order\u201d. 11 \nGoffman sees interaction as a ritual which gives a sense of social belonging and value as an \nindividual, with the interaction order acting as a conceptual map to each occasion of face-\nto-face interaction. We use this to explain some of the problems reported by women and to \nhelp inform good practice in primary care.  \nMethods \nSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 women from across the East Midlands \nwho had all experienced cervical screening in England. We opted to recruit participants  \noutside of the formal healthcare system, as we wished to avoid any misunderstanding that \nthe work constituted any form of \u2018service evaluation\u2019 of particular professionals or care \norganisations. Participants were recruited through a range of community groups that had a \npredominantly female membership (for example, mother and toddler groups, and women\u2019s \ngroups). In each case, contact was made with the group lead and she was asked to circulate \nwritten information about the study. Willing volunteers were asked to contact the \n5 \n \nresearchers directly.  In addition, snowball sampling was used to a limited degree in order to \nrecruit from groups  that proved hard to reach, including older South Asian women. 12 Due \nto the recruitment strategies used, we do not know how many women received the \ninformation but declined to participate. \n \n Individual semi-structured interviews, focusing on participants\u2019 experiences of cervical \nscreening, were conducted by the first author, facilitated in three interviews by an \ninterpreter. The interviews lasted approximately one hour and took place in women\u2019s \nhomes or community group premises.   An interview guide was used to ensure coverage of a \nnumber of key areas identified in advance of the data collection, but no attempt was made \nto restrict the interviews to these topics or control the order in which they were discussed. \nWomen were free to influence the course of their interviews and to introduce issues of \nparticular importance or relevance to themselves. All interviews were audio-recorded, fully \ntranscribed, and anonymised. \nInstitutional ethical approval for the project was obtained. All participants received written \ninformation about the study, were assured of anonymity, and gave their informed consent \nto participate.  \nData analysis was led by the first author, with support and checking provided by the second \nauthor. Analysis was based upon the constant comparative method. 13 Key themes within \nthe data were identified, analysed and explored through repeated close readings and \nannotation of interview transcripts concurrent with data collection. Individual transcripts \nwere compared and contrasted, and deviant cases identified and explored. The identified \nthemes were then used to develop and refine a coding framework which was subsequently \n6 \n \napplied systematically to the full data set. NVivo software was used to aid the coding, \nmanagement and retrieval of data. The illustrative quotes included below were selected as \nparticularly clear and\/or concise examples. \nFindings \nA diverse sample of 34 participants was recruited, including women from a range of ages \nand ethnic backgrounds (Table 1). Thirty-two women had had at least two cervical screens \nat the time of interview; the other two had had one test.   \nTable 1. Summary of sample characteristics \nAge range 26-60 years \nEthnic \nbackground \n13 White British, 10 South Asian, 11 African Caribbean \nSocio-economic \ngroup \n18 higher socio-economic group (1, 2 and 3 non-manual), 16 lower \nsocio-economic group (3 manual, 4 and 5) \nMarital status 22 married, 4 co-habiting, 2 widowed, 2 single, 4 separated\/divorced \nChildren 29 with children, 5 without children \n \nCervical screening as a problematic encounter \nThe occasion of cervical screening can be understood as what Goffman terms a \u201cfocused \ninteraction\u201d: 11 one in which there is a mutual activity in which both parties are engaged.  \nBoth parties must cooperate to sustain activity. This is an interaction with some very \ndistinctive features, however. The healthcare professional (primary care doctor or, more \nusually, nurse) is able to gain access to parts of the body that social norms would otherwise \nprohibit, 14 and the woman is expected to permit penetration of the vagina. Our data \nsuggest that the accomplishment of this interaction is an unsatisfactory experience for many \nwomen. Although some women did not find the experience problematic, most participants \n(25 of the 34 women) reported embarrassment and discomfort (sometimes severe) in \n7 \n \nexposing an intimate and personal part of their body to the practitioner conducting the \nprocedure. Some felt the cervical screening procedure involved surrendering control over \ntheir body, and described the experience as painful, uncomfortable and personally \nthreatening.  \nPersonally I still find it embarrassing exposing my body to people I don\u2019t know. So \nyes, it does matter to me. I find it terribly embarrassing you know just stripping off \nmy clothes. (Participant 32) \nThe one they did when they found the abnormal cells really hurt me\u2026it was really, \nreally painful. (Participant 34) \nAmong women\u2019s anxieties was fear that their body would betray them, and that they would \nsuffer shame and humiliation as a result. \nNow that would be embarrassing for me if, because they were pressing on the \nbladder and it\u2019s cold, if I wet myself and that is a fear that I have.   \n(Participant 28) \nI thought well, you know, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m going to let off wind (laughs) and (I was) really \nsort of nervous.  Talk about contracting your pelvic floor muscles, it was really hard to \nsort of get the instrument inside me, you know, oh god. So that was one of my worst \nsort of fears I think (laughs).  (Participant 34) \nConcerns about the potential for discrediting of the self were joined by feelings of acute \nvulnerability.  Cervical screening could be experienced as an invasion of privacy, or even a \nviolation; some women\u2019s accounts represented the procedure as an invasion with overtly \nsexualised connotations. 15 16  \nI don\u2019t know what the implement is called but it is quite big and erm I suppose it\u2019s \nshaped like a penis as well, isn\u2019t it. But it\u2019s cold and you know that there\u2019s an \nimplement that is pushed in and so that\u2019s painful as well.  (Participant 10) \nIt\u2019s almost like invasion of privacy and sometimes I think to myself, you know like, \nyou think of some doctors that like abuse patients, probably either male or female \nand I think to myself \u201cI wonder if they get off on it\u201d [...]You don\u2019t know what kind of \nperson they are and what they\u2019re thinking of when they examine you, you know what \nI mean, you can\u2019t see what they are doing but I suppose you can feel what they\u2019re \ndoing but then again I don\u2019t know.  I mean anything can happen\u2026you\u2019ve got no \n8 \n \ncontrol, at all, especially when they\u2019ve got instruments up you, it\u2019s not like you can \nsay \u201cLook drag it out\u201d and get down because you could injure yourself.  \n(Participant 18) \nThe pivotal role of the healthcare professional \nSubmitting to cervical screening implicitly relies on trust in the person performing the \nprocedure,17 and one useful definition of trust sees it as \u201cthe willingness of a party to be \nvulnerable\u201d. 18 However, 14 of the 34 women explicitly reported poor quality encounters \nwith primary care practitioners during cervical screening, and described disappointment at \nhow they had been treated \u2013 suggesting a betrayal of trust.  \nWomen\u2019s complaints focused in particular on a failure of healthcare professionals to reach \nwith them a shared definition of the situation, which Goffman defines as \u201cagreement \nconcerning perceptual relevancies and irrelevancies, and a \u2018working consensus\u2019 involving a \ndegree of mutual considerateness, sympathy, and a muting of opinion differences\u201d. 11 For \nwomen, what the professional performing the procedure selected for attention and what \nthey deemed irrelevant was poorly aligned with women\u2019s own priorities for attention.  For \nwomen, the cervical screening encounter was something significant and out of the ordinary, \nyet they were often confronted by a health professional who treated the encounter as \nroutine and empty of any emotional significance.  They reported that the norms governing \nthe interaction were often far from what they would see as optimal, yet they felt passive \nand deprived of any power to influence the conduct of professionals. \nI didn\u2019t very much care for the person that did it. I thought, I found her very abrupt \nand he kind of said \u201ccome on relax\u201d you know and of course that makes you\u2026. I just \nthink erm anybody who carries out these tests should be very aware of people\u2019s \nfeelings and err I think they should pick up on the fact that some people are more \nnervous than others definitely\u2026 I tried to make a joke about something and she was \njust, she completely ignored me and err, you know, I just found her very abrupt and I \nfelt like slapping her face to be honest. (Participant 14) \n9 \n \nIt was the nurse she wasn\u2019t very, you know, she didn\u2019t make me, make me relaxed, \nyou know. I just felt like she just had to do what she had to do and I didn\u2019t know what \nwas happening. Maybe she didn\u2019t prepare me enough. (Participant 26) \nThese encounters were typically characterised as cold and impersonal, or even as degrading. \nProfessionals\u2019 attempts to adopt a \u2018businesslike\u2019 approach or normalise the encounter 19 \nwere a particular focus of criticism.  Women found it unacceptable to be approached as \u2018just \nanother body\u2019 by a professional who appeared to act as though the emotional response of \nthe woman to the encounter, or her characteristics as an individual, were, in Goffman\u2019s \nterms, \u201cirrelevant\u201d. \nThey were hurting me and just kind of ignoring me.  Not putting any attention on \nwhat I was feeling, you know and that it was actually hurting me, they thought I was \njust joking.  You know they were kind of like, I felt that they were just not considerate \nat all, they were really harsh, they weren\u2019t gentle at all. (Participant 23) \nIt\u2019s just so cold. You go in, you take your clothes off, she does that and I mean it\u2019s just \nso, it\u2019s just so degrading and embarrassing. It\u2019s just horrible. (Participant 2) \nSome techniques used by professionals for normalising the encounter \u2013 such as \nstressing its routine nature or emphasising that the doctor or nurse had seen \nmany vaginas before - could, for women, make things worse not better, as they \nsuggested the apparent potential for comparisons to be made and for an \nindividual to be found wanting in some way.  \nAlthough you\u2019re in a room, you feel open and naked you know. It\u2019s such an intrusion \non your person. Doctors have seen a lot of vaginas but they didn\u2019t see mine and \nthat\u2019s it for me. You may have seen hundreds but you didn\u2019t see mine before.  So I \njust saw it as an invasion of my person and my privacy. (Participant 10) \nRather than a detached approach, women reported that they would welcome some degree \nof engagement, personalisation and tailoring on the part of the healthcare professional, and \nthat emotional preparation and reassurance would help them cope better.  \n10 \n \nYou know it\u2019s that dreaded thing, but yeah the last two times have been a lot better \nbecause it\u2019s been performed by the nurse so it\u2019s been a totally different, a totally \ndifferent experience. Still sort of\u2026but not as horrific as it was when the doctor does it. \n(Participant 16, 50-64, African-Caribbean) \nI think that the nurses are very good, certainly mine was. Partly that was explaining \nwhat she was doing and why she was doing it, and partly making you as comfortable \nas you could possibly be, so that it doesn\u2019t last long and it isn\u2019t as embarrassing and \nit isn\u2019t as painful. It is as acceptable as it can be. (Participant 8, 50-64, White British) \nThese two examples demonstrate the key role of practitioners in rendering the procedure \nmore tolerable.  \nDiscussion \nThe information leaflet given to women participating in the UK Cervical Screening \nProgramme presents cervical screening as a straightforward procedure, 20 and the \nprogramme itself enjoys massive public support \u2013 including enthusiasm for both widening \nthe age criteria for inclusion and for more frequent screening. Our study suggests that \nwomen\u2019s private experiences of the cervical screening test are often negative, and are not \nconsistently managed optimally in primary care. Women report feeling passive, helpless and \nvulnerable in the face of a situation where they risk pain and discomfort, shame and \nhumiliation, and violation and invasion of privacy.  These are the very features of their \nexperiences that may not be selected for attention by primary care professionals, but rather \ntreated as irrelevant. As Strong notes, the main concern of rules of relevance is with \nindelicacy \u2013 what must be avoided or ignored. 21 Yet efforts by health professionals to \nminimise or ignore any personal significance associated with the encounter, to construct it \nas a routine, everyday occurrence, or to distance themselves from the physical and \nemotional intimacy of the interaction, may all backfire.  Such behaviour may signal a failure \n11 \n \nto reach a shared definition of the situation. Ignoring women\u2019s fears, anxieties and concerns \ncan appear to deny the reality, or at least the validity, of women\u2019s emotional responses.  \nThis study would have been strengthened by inclusion of interviews with practitioners, and \nby observations of cervical screening encounters \u2013 though this latter would be ethically \nproblematic. It is also a small study that makes no claims to representativeness; a survey \napproach would be needed to quantify frequency of the views expressed. Nonetheless, it \noffers some useful suggestions on how women\u2019s experiences might be improved. \nOur work suggests that more emphasis on what Goffman calls \u201cthe minor courtesies\u201d might \ngo a long way towards making cervical screening a less challenging experience for women. \nBetter routines for primary care professionals\u2019 management of the procedure, going beyond \nproviding standard information 22 and seeking to engage more personally with the woman, \nmight help facilitate more positive experiences. This should include more explicit \nrecognition of the particular significance of the intimate and personal nature of the \nprocedure, and its associated anxieties and fears. There is unlikely to be a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 \nsolution in terms of what specifically health professionals need to do to better support \nwomen. For example, women are likely to find different aspects of cervical screening \nchallenging, and these concerns may arise from a range of different sources including both \nthose linked to prior screening experiences and those that women bring to the screening \nencounter from elsewhere. Explicitly asking women about their expectations of the \nscreening encounter and whether they have any worries or concerns may help to surface \nissues that the health professional and woman involved can then seek to tackle together. In \nthis way, both parties can be involved in developing a shared understanding and definition \nof the interaction in which they are co-present , and the likelihood that they will be able to \n12 \n \nsuccessfully work together to sustain the activity and complete it to their mutual satisfaction \nmay be increased.   \nPrimary care professionals need to undertake interpersonal, emotional work 23 to solicit the \nwilling participation of patients and foster a trusting and safe environment in which women \ncan feel comfortable about breaching what can be very strongly held ideas about what is \nand is not appropriate bodily conduct. Working with and on bodies in healthcare settings \ncan be emotionally draining, laborious and demanding, 24 but explaining what is being done \nand why, and being attentive to women\u2019s comfort and individual preferences, go a long way \ntowards making the cervical screening experience \u201cas acceptable as it can be\u201d. \n13 \n \n \nReferences \n                                                          \n1 Department of Health. http:\/\/www.dh.gov.uk\/en\/MediaCentre\/Statements\/DH_116591 \n2010 (last accessed 22nd June 2011) \n2 Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening.
