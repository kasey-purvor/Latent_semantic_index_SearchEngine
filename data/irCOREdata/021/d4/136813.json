Introduction \n \nNot all parts of the world are blessed with the latest in \ntelecommunications services, and simply being able to \nplace a call can be an achievement in itself. In parts of \nAfrica, for example, where village communities represent \na significant part of the population, a supporting \ntelecommunications infrastructure is invariably \nnonexistent. In such parts of the world, the employment of \nmobile communications to alleviate the need for a fixed \nground network infrastructure significantly speeds up the \ndeployment of telecommunications facilities. \nTo achieve the vision of a global information society \nwill require the widespread availability of Information and \nCommunications Technologies (ICT) and the \ndevelopment of appropriate applications and media \ncontent. The widespread deployment of \ntelecommunications services is a key to future economic \nprosperity, sustainable development and improvement in \nthe quality of life of the 21st century citizen. In this \nrespect, bridging the ever-widening gap of the digital \ndivide between developed and developing regions of the \nworld is a fundamental component of establishing the \nglobal information society. \nVeSeL (Village e-Science for Life), which began in \nSeptember 2006, is a three-year project and is part of the \nBridging the Global Digital Divide Network funded by the \nUK\u2019s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil [1]. The VeSeL project\u2019s objectives, which are \nfocused on Kenyan rural farming communities, address \nboth educational and technological issues in establishing \nthe most urgent information and learning requirements \nand subsequently, designing and testing appropriate \ntechnologies to meet these needs. VeSeL aims to explore \nand develop participatory methods for novel socio-\ntechnical solutions in rural communities with particular \nemphasis on overcoming educational barriers. This \ninvolves working with trainee teachers to enable them to \nexplore ICT in novel ways to enhance ICT and basic \nskills, for example literacy and numeracy, in rural \ncommunities. Appropriate partnerships for long-term \nsustainability, for example with agricultural bureaus and \nlocal universities, will be formed, as will community \nnetworks with teachers and farmers.  \nIn terms of technology, VeSeL intends to identify and \ndevelop the most appropriate technologies including: \nnovel technologies for collecting, analyzing, archiving and \nvisualizing information to support farmers to develop \nimproved agricultural practices; innovative \ncommunication access facilities for sharing between \nisolated and dispersed rural communities; and radically \nFifth IEEE International Conference on Wireless, Mobile, and Ubiquitous Technology in Education\n0-7695-3108-3\/08 $25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109\/WMUTE.2008.18\n135\ndifferent user interfaces for illiterate or semi-literate user \ngroups. \nUsing DRKs, the interface and interaction approach of \nmobile, two-way information systems are designed. \nMobile technologies are employed to bridge remote \nsensor networks and centralized ICT access points, with \nnovel power solutions, usage scenarios, and device \ninterfaces. The DRK includes equipment such as audio \nrecorders, MP3\/MP4 players and recorders, , laptops, \nmodems, handheld GPS units, digital cameras, solar \npowered charging and battery charging equipment; \nsensors and weather stations are self\u2013contained interfaces \nof the KMS. The remainder of this paper is organised as \nfollows: In Section 2, the background to the development \nof a Knowledge Management System (KMS) for African \nrural farming communities is presented. Section 3 then \npresents the existing local communication channels and \nconstraints. Section 4 shows a web-based KMS for rural \nfarming communities. In Section 5, KM initiatives for \nKambu rural farming communities are proposed. Section \n6 presents the explanation of KMS components, and \nfinally, Section 7 provides some concluding remarks. \n \n2. Knowledge Management for Rural \nFarming Communities \n \nIn order to be successful, Knowledge Management \n(KM) initiatives for Kenyan rural farming communities \nneed to equally address both technological (i.e. \nKnowledge Management System (KMS)\u2019s) and social \ndimensions (i.e. community culture) [2, 3]. The degree of \nfit between the two KM dimensions should be reflected in \nthe way communities interact with and the degree to \nwhich they accept the KMS [4], i.e. information systems \ndesigned to support individuals in performing KM-related \nagriculture activities. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is \nto develop a KMS model and dissemination scenario for \nKenyan rural farming communities, integrated with \nexisting local communication channels and introducing \nKM initiatives (involving advanced technology). These \nKM initiatives can be thought of as educational \ntechnology (or socio-technical) experiments. \nFollowing analysis of data collected during visits to \nseveral communities in Kenya in November 2006, the \nVeSeL project decided to focus on two farming \ncommunities, one located in Kiangwaci and the other in \nKambu. Key needs for these communities were identified \nto be improved information about funding for \ndevelopment, education about efficient water usage\/water \nmanagement, soil and fertilizers, pest control, crop \nmanagement\/suitable crops, improved access to weather \nand market information.  \nIn order to support the delivery of these educational \nand informational needs, a \u2018system\u2019 is required that would \nuse technology to provide local access to, collation and \narchiving of, and sharing of resources relevant to local \nneeds. The system must also enable the community to \npublicise local needs, products, issues and news, and to \ncommunicate locally and globally. Thus, it enables \ncollaboration with outside experts and other partners. \nThe following hardware and infrastructure \nrequirements are proposed to develop a KMS model and \ndissemination scenario:  \n\u2022 Affordable efficient Internet access in Kambu and \nKiangwaci; \n\u2022 Caching of content from the KMS to the local \ncontent server; \n\u2022 Interfacing of a local content server to data capture \nunits, for example, from weather stations, sensors \nand records captured on handheld devices; \n\u2022 Interfacing of local content server to existing local \ninformation delivery channels such as radio, mobile \nphones and public meetings; \n\u2022 Interfacing of local content server to experimental \ndelivery channels such as MP3\/MP4 players; \n\u2022 Innovative and inexpensive ways of charging varied \nbattery powered portable devices (components of the \nresource kit mentioned above); \n\u2022 The whole kit needs to be mobile to support working \nin dispersed communities. One option is for the \nentire kit to be carried on and possibly charged by a \nbicycle. \n \n3. Existing Local Communication Channels \nand Constraints \n \nCurrently, within the Kenyan rural farming \ncommunities, radio and mobile phones are the most \nfrequently used as a communications media; most people \nin the area listen to radio quite regularly, usually early in \nthe morning before they set out for work or school, or in \nthe evening. Kambu has its own radio station. Television \nis much less popular since most families do not own one \nor do not have electricity. In the town centre, bars, hotels \nand stores offer TV and at night time, some villagers \nmake way to the centre to socialise. Radio Mangelete in \nKambu is the only community radio in Kenya. It is owned \nby a number of community groups and is run by local \nvolunteers. \nAt almost every place visited there were mobile phone \nsignals, with Celtel providing the strongest coverage. \nNevertheless, Safaricom appears to be the most popular \nnetwork among the inhabitants. Some argue that this is \ndue to the fact that Safaricom was the first to penetrate the \ntown. However, the centre of the town experiences loss of \n136\nsignal whenever users are inside concrete buildings. With \nCeltel, although the signal strength is low within \nbuildings, communication is still possible. \nAlmost every family has access to a mobile phone, \neither directly (owned) or indirectly (friends or relatives \nnearby). Cost of handset, charging and credit do not \nrepresent a barrier to accessing or acquiring one, although \nliteracy is a barrier. Few houses have electricity to charge \nmobile phones. Therefore, most phones can be out of \nservice for two to three days due to flat batteries. \nRecharging greatly depends also on the level of activity \nand income. Phones can be charged by traveling to the \ntown centre to charge the phone weekly. In periods where \nfarmers are not harvesting, and therefore not selling crops \nto earn income, charging or adding credit to a mobile can \nbe delayed or ignored.  \nIn terms of usage, farmers do not usually make \ntelephone calls because of the expense and are not \nconfident about using text messaging, which is viewed as \ntime consuming. Normally, relatives and friends in the \ntowns having salaried jobs will call the farmers. Those in \nthe villages will not call then, unless it is an emergency, \nalthough there is adequate network reception to operate \nphones. \nLocal community-based organisations and farmer self-\nhelp groups use a variety of methods to disseminate \ninformation and educate communities including public \nmeetings, theatre, murals and farmer field schools. Most \nfamilies have children attending school as primary \neducation is free in Kenya and education is generally \nregarded as important. Schools and school teachers have a \nsignificant role in the community. \n \n4. Web-Based Knowledge Management \nSystem for Rural Farming Communities \n \nThe idea behind our KMS for Kenyan rural farming \ncommunities is to collect, store and disseminate \nknowledge with interfaces to existing local \ncommunication channels and experimental channels \nthrough the VeSeL DRK. Before the KMS scenarios and \ndissemination model are introduced, the Web-based KMS \nis first explained. The Web-based KMS is expected to \ndeliver the following features through intermediaries (e.g. \nlocal NGOs, school, radio) to the farmers and to connect \nthem to global communities of relevant expertise [5]: \n\u2022 Provide online information and services about \nrelevant agricultural practice; \n\u2022 Support discussion and learning between local and \nremote communities around rural farming issues; \n\u2022 Provide searchable information on agriculture;  \n\u2022 Provide access to expert advice and troubleshooting \nrelated to agricultural problems via the Internet; \n\u2022 Educate communities in the use of the Internet to \naccess important and useful information and \nservices; \n\u2022 Enable the communities to experiment with ways of \nusing the Internet to support their lives. \nThe technical requirements of a Web-based KMS are \nas follows [6]: \n\u2022 Web Server \nThe hardware of the Web server is to be designed \nbased on the traffic, network configuration, etc.  \n\u2022 Programming Language and Database \nThe programming language can be selected \ndepending on the server support.  \n\u2022 KM Portal \nOne Web portal can be developed using any Internet \nhosting solutions and access can be restricted using \nlogin systems. Users with different levels of \npermission can access contributions\/articles of \ndifferent authors. This type of system helps in \nsharing best practices, experiments and innovations. \n\u2022 Web-Based Discussion Board or Forum \nA virtual community can be created by using Web-\nbased discussion boards. Different sections or areas \ncan be created for discussions. Here, the discussions \nare available for all in the communities to \nview\/post\/reply to the topics. This is an ideal \nsolution for communities located in different \ngeographical areas but having common areas of \ninterest such as rural farming communities.  \n\u2022 Blogs \nWeb logs (\u2018blogs\u2019) are popular and companies have \nutilised this tool to create awareness and evolve \nopinions on different issues.  \n\u2022 Expert System \nBy encouraging communities to post their problems \nor difficulties to an expert system, they can save time \nand money in finding best solutions to their \nproblems. This helps in creating innovation and a \nlearning culture in the communities. \n \n5. A Scenario for Mobile, Ubiquitous and \nCollaborative Learning in Kambu \n \nIn this paper, the dissemination scenarios will focus \non Kambu farming communities, the homes of which are \nshown in Figure 1. The Kambu site is logistically more \nchallenging because the community is spread out over a \nwide area and the farms are remote from the main roads \neven though Mtito Andei, the nearby town centre, is a \nstopping area on the main road between Nairobi and \nMombassa. Accessing farms requires a means  of  \ntransport  such as \n137\n \nFigure 1. Homes in Kambu \n \nmotorbikes, bicycles or four-wheel drive vehicles. The \nlevel of education is also low, which has significance \nfor language communication. The Kambu community is \nthe needier because the lack of water makes crop \nproduction more challenging. On the other hand, \nKiangwaci has a number of advantages, such as relative \naccessibility, plentiful water supply and rich soil, which \nis likely to mean ICT intervention produces results \nmore rapidly, which will encourage the community to \ncontinue and persevere with the project. In addition, the \ncommunity farms are much more compact. \nThe suggested use cases initially address the most \nurgent issues perceived by the investigators, which in \nKambu are water management and irrigation. The KM \ninitiatives and dissemination scenarios for Kambu \ncommunities are outlined as follows: \n\u2022 Silanga School (in partnership with Mtito-Andei \nDevelopment Initiative (MDI) and University of \nNairobi (UoN)) start a 4K club (4K=Kuungana, \nKujenga, Kusaidia, Kenya; that is an agriculture \nclub for students) with a demonstration shamba \n(Kiswahili for \u201cfield\u201d or \u201cgarden\u201d) at a location \nnear the existing water pump. The shamba is used \nto grow watermelons and to demonstrate efficient \nwater management and good agricultural practice. \nEducational content relating to water management, \ngood agricultural practice for arid lands and \nappropriate new crop opportunities is acquired \nand localised by VESEL through UoN agricultural \ncolleagues, the Kenya Agriculture Research \nInstitute (KARI) and other international partners. \nThis content is stored on a remote, Web-\naccessible server (at University of Bradford, UK) \nand an international community is built around \nthis content. \n\u2022 Content is delivered to a local content server in \nKambu \u2014 at the radio station \u2014 and disseminated \nvia use in school\/radio\/public meetings. School \nactivities utilising this content are designed and \nsupported through appropriate use of the VeSeL \nDRK. Content can also be delivered as podcasts \nor requested from and delivered to mobile phones \nusing a content server (similar to MobilED \nmediawiki system) [7]. \n\u2022 Pupils and staff are involved in recording the \nShamba demonstration project and \ncommunicating it using activities and technology \nfrom the VeSeL DRK. These activities result in \nmultimedia (audio\/video\/text) presentations. Use \nof the DRK is managed and facilitated by the \nteacher from Silanga School who has a successful \nagricultural practice. The DRK, which includes \nsensors for measuring local agricultural and \nweather conditions and provides remote access to \nglobal agricultural databases, is portable, so that it \ncould be carried on a bicycle; the bicycle in turn \nmay be used to charge some of the devices. \n138\n\u2022 Progress on the demonstration shamba and \nexperimental uses of ICT are communicated \nglobally via the Silanga School, MDI and \nMangelete Radio websites. The area of the MDI \noffice is illustrated in Figure 2. Creation and \nmanagement of these websites are facilitated \nthrough VeSeL with management gradually being \ntaken on by local owners. \n\u2022 Reports on project progress are also broadcast \nlocally through Radio Mangelete. Staff and \nchildren at school are able to listen to broadcasts \n(and interactive radio) using wind-up radios \n(provided by VeSeL). These wind-up radios may \nalso be used to charge low power items in the \nDRK, such as MP3 players. MP3 players with \nintegrated radio can be used to record interactive \neducation broadcasts, which can be archived and \nplayed back using low powered FM transmitters \nand the wind-up radios. \nThe school website is used to promote the project \ninternationally and to attract global partners (e.g. \nUK Schools, AridLands, Gardens4Life); the \nschool and other partner websites can also be used \nto promote specific projects developed by the \nlocal community\/school and funding\/donor \nrequests. \nAn example of initial community publishing linked \nto school and related activities is presented in Figure 3. \nThe school has the objective to communicate about itself \nand Kambu, in general. Each class takes it in turn to plan \nand produce a short report, news piece or \u2018study\u2019 \nresulting in a regular \u2018post\u2019 for the school website. \nImages, video and\/or data are captured using borrowed \ndevices and short \u2018multimedia\u2019 reports are planned \u2018on \npaper\u2019 and then authored on mobile phones. \u2018Reports\u2019 \nare delivered to local KMS (probably via short range \ncommunications). An ingestion system \u2018reads\u2019 reports \nand creates \u2018posts\u2019 on a local copy of the website\/blog \n(which if necessary can be edited locally). An online \nmirror of the local KMS is updated (timing of this \ndepends on resource centre connectivity options). The \nwebsite is visible globally and may attract \ncomments\/questions \u2013 this can be stimulated by \narranging school linking, etc. (comments to an online \nsite need to be mirrored on the local copy). \nFigure 4 presents an example of initial water \neducation and related activities. Researchers identify, \ntranslate and repurpose educational material on water \nharvesting\/drought resistant crops\/irrigation\/water usage. \nMaterial is collated and made available online and at the \nMDI resource centre local server. Information and \nknowledge is disseminated via local radio, resource \ncentre screenings, posters, etc. Local \u2018water\u2019 \naction\/projects are reported online via \u2018community \nblogs\u2019 along with requests for expertise, funding, \nquestions, etc. The MDI copy of \u2018community blogs\u2019 is \nmirrored to an online site and read globally; comments \nand advice are posted by outsiders and then fed back to \nthe local community. \n \n \nFigure 2. MDI Office \n139\n6. Knowledge Management System \nComponents \n \nAccording to the scenarios and sketches, KMS \ncomponents are shown in Figure 5. There are five \ncomponents of the KMS: content, technologies, VeSeL \nDRK (output), resources (input) and technical \nspecification. Content is a collection of data, \ninformation and knowledge that is needed by the \nKambu rural farming community: funding for \ndevelopment, water usage\/water management, soil and \nfertilizers, education, pest control, crop \nmanagement\/suitable crops, weather, and market \ninformation. It is planned to explore appropriate \ntechnologies that are suitable to farming community \nneeds. Social networking, personal learning and mobile \ndevice interfaces to Web services are preferred. The \nKMS will interface with the VeSeL DRK, either \ndirectly to the community or via a mediator (student, \npublic meeting, teacher, theatre).  \nA dissemination scenario of the KMS to the \ncommunity can be seen in Figure 6. A KMS resource \n(or input) will be reliable information from the locality \n(e.g. soil sensors, weather station) and beyond (e.g. \nInternet, radio), local knowledge and expertise, such as \nthat possessed by MDI, other community members and \ntools such as mobile phones, MP3\/MP4 players and \nrecorders , word processing and email. The technical \nspecification for KMS is divided into two groups: \nhardware and software. Drupal and MobilED are  \ncandidate platform for KMS development, which could \ninclude mobile device interfaces to web services, for \nexample, Facebook, and a combination of some \nfunctions available in social networking\/software such \nas Flickr, MySpace, YouTube, according to \ncommunity\u2019s interest and behaviors. \n \n7. Conclusions \n \nThere are now a number of technological solutions \nthat are bringing ever closer the realisation of the \ninformation society in many parts of the world. \nHowever, many parts of the world are devoid of \ncommunication facilities and there is a real danger that \nthe digital divide will eventually be too great to bridge. \nKey to addressing the digital divide are affordable \nwireless communications devices and the Internet. \nWireless communications has an important part to play \nin many parts of the world where a fixed network \ninfrastructure is not available. Similarly, the Internet \nprovides the opportunity to disseminate activities, to \ngain access to information and to communicate with \ngroups of a similar nature on a global scale. VeSeL aims \nto combine these technologies to provide a basis for \neducating rural African farming communities by \nfocusing on two villages in Kenya.  \nWork has already commenced on developing an \nintegrated KMS, which will be used to provide \neducation in water management and agricultural \npractice. For future developments, the school and \ncommunity will use the KMS and DRKs in other \nexploratory educational activities designed by VeSeL \n(for example, to map and communicate the location of \nimportant local resources wells, etc.). Gradually the \nschool and community will become involved in \ndesigning their own activities using  the DRK and \nfacilitated by local and remote VeSeL partners (e.g. a \nlocal farmer offers to plant and look after Jatropha for \npeople in the developed world wanting to sponsor 'trees' \nto offset CO2 production; a website is designed to \npromote the business, people can sponsor a tree through \nPaypal or directly by international text messages; \npayment is delivered to the farmer through their mobile \nphone; the sponsor receives an MMS of their tree being \nplanted or sees it on the online photo blog, tree location \ncan be seen on Google Earth, perhaps also the sponsor \ncan pay to see how the tree is growing again in the \nfuture, farmer pays VeSeL facilitator for service \nprovided in setting up and recording tree planting). \nThe first scenario of DRKs implementation started in \nJanuary 2008 where laptops, digital camera and audio \nrecorders were delivered to Kenya. The laptops are \nsupplemented with GPRS modems and a data plan, and \nthis will provide a first fixed Internet connectivity \nsolution for the community. An interactive scenario for \nschool and community has designed. This will be a good \nstarting point for the community to be familiar with the \nactivities before they get involved in KMS activity. We \nexpect to report initial results about the introduction and \nuse of DRKs at the WMUTE conference. \n \n \n140\n  \nFigure 3.
