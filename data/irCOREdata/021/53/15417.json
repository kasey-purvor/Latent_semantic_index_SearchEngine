We study P6-free graphs, i.e., graphs that do not contain an\ninduced path on six vertices. Our main result is a new characterization of\nthis graph class: a graph G is P6-free if and only if each connected induced\nsubgraph of G on more than one vertex contains a dominating induced\ncycle on six vertices or a dominating (not necessarily induced) complete\nbipartite subgraph. This characterization is minimal in the sense that\nthere exists an infinite family of P6-free graphs for which a smallest con-\nnected dominating subgraph is a (not induced) complete bipartite graph.\nOur characterization of P6-free graphs strengthens results of Liu and\nZhou, and of Liu, Peng and Zhao. Our proof has the extra advantage of\nbeing constructive: we present an algorithm that finds such a dominating\nsubgraph of a connected P6-free graph in polynomial time. This enables\nus to solve the Hypergraph 2-Colorability problem in polynomial\ntime for the class of hypergraphs with P6-free incidence graphs.\n1 Introduction\nAll graphs in this paper are undirected, finite, and simple, i.e., without loops\nand multiple edges. Furthermore, unless specifically stated otherwise, all graphs\nare non-trivial, i.e., contain at least two vertices. For undefined terminology we\nrefer to [8]. Let G = (V,E) be a graph. For a subset U \u2286 V we denote by G[U ]\nthe subgraph of G induced by U . A subset S \u2286 V is called a clique if G[S] is\na complete graph. A set U \u2286 V dominates a set U \u2032 \u2286 V if any vertex v \u2208 U \u2032\neither lies in U or has a neighbor in U . We also say that U dominates G[U \u2032].\nA subgraph H of G is a dominating subgraph of G if V (H) dominates G. We\nwrite Pk, Ck,Kk to denote the path, cycle and complete graph on k vertices,\nrespectively.\nA graph G is called H-free for some graph H if G does not contain an induced\nsubgraph isomorphic to H. For any family F of graphs, let Forb(F) denote the\nclass of graphs that are F -free for every F \u2208 F . We consider the class Forb({Pt})\nof graphs that do not contain an induced path on t vertices. Note that Forb({P2})\nis the class of graphs without any edge and Forb({P3}) is the class of graphs all\ncomponents of which are complete graphs.\n? This work has been supported by EPSRC (EP\/D053633\/1).\n\u2020 An extended abstract of this paper has been accepted for COCOON 2008.\nThe class of P4-free graphs (or cographs) has been studied extensively (cf. [5]).\nThe following characterization of Forb({P4, C4}), i.e., the class of C4-free co-\ngraphs, is due to Wolk [19, 20] (see also Theorem 11.3.4 in [5]).\nTheorem 1 ([19, 20]). A graph G is P4-free and C4-free if and only if each\nconnected induced subgraph of G contains a dominating vertex.\nWe can slightly modify this theorem to obtain a characterization of P4-free\ngraphs.\nTheorem 2. A graph G is P4-free if and only if each connected induced subgraph\nof G contains a dominating induced C4 or a dominating vertex.\nSince this theorem can be proven using similar (but much easier) arguments as\nin the proof of our main result, its proof is omitted here.\nThe following characterization of P5-free graphs is due to Liu and Zhou [14].\nTheorem 3 ([14]). A graph G is P5-free if and only if each connected induced\nsubgraph of G contains a dominating induced C5 or a dominating clique.\nA graph G is called triangle extended complete bipartite (TECB) if it is a com-\nplete bipartite graph or if it can be obtained from a complete bipartite graph\nF by adding some extra vertices w1, . . . , wr and edges wiu,wiv for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r to\nexactly one edge uv of F (see Figure 1 for an example).\nu\nv\nw1 w2\nFig. 1. An example of a TECB graph.\nThe following characterization of P6-free graphs is due to Liu, Peng and Zhao [15].\nTheorem 4 ([15]). A graph G is P6-free if and only if each connected induced\nsubgraph of G contains a dominating induced C6 or a dominating (not necessarily\ninduced) TECB graph.\nIf we consider graphs that are not only P6-free but also triangle-free, then we\nhave one of the main results in [14].\nTheorem 5 ([14]). A triangle-free graph G is P6-free if and only if each con-\nnected induced subgraph of G contains a dominating induced C6 or a dominating\n(not necessarily induced) complete bipartite graph.\nA characterization of Forb({Pt}) for t \u2265 7 is given in [1]: Forb({Pt}) is the class\nof graphs for which each connected induced subgraph has a dominating subgraph\nof diameter at most t\u2212 4.\n2\nOur results\nSection 3 contains our main result.\nTheorem 6. A graph G is P6-free if and only if each connected induced subgraph\nof G contains a dominating induced C6 or a dominating (not necessarily induced)\ncomplete bipartite graph. Moreover, we can find such a dominating subgraph in\npolynomial time.\nThis theorem strengthens Theorem 4 and Theorem 5 in two different ways.\nFirstly, Theorem 6 shows that we may omit the restriction \u201ctriangle-free\u201d in\nTheorem 5 and that we may replace the class of TECB graphs by its proper\nsubclass of complete bipartite graphs in in Theorem 4. Secondly, in contrast to\nthe proofs of Theorem 4 and Theorem 5, the proof of Theorem 6 is constructive:\nwe provide a (polynomial time) algorithm for finding the desired dominating\nsubgraph. Note that we cannot use some brute force approach to obtain such a\npolynomial time algorithm, since a dominating complete bipartite graph might\nhave arbitrarily large size.\nIn Section 3, we also show that the characterization in Theorem 6 is minimal\nin the sense that there exists an infinite family of P6-free graphs for which a\nsmallest connected dominating subgraph is a (not induced) complete bipartite\ngraph. We would like to mention that the algorithm used to prove Theorem 6\nalso works for an arbitrary (not necessarily P6-free) graph G: in that case the\nalgorithm either finds a dominating subgraph as described in Theorem 6 or\nfinds an induced P6 in G. Furthermore, we can easily modify our algorithm\nso that it finds a dominating induced C5 or a dominating clique of a P5-free\ngraph in polynomial time. This yields a constructive proof of Theorem 3 and\ngeneralizes the algorithm by Cozzens and Kelleher [7] that finds a dominating\nclique of a connected graph without an induced P5 or C5. We end Section 3 by\ncharacterizing the class of graphs for which each connected induced subgraph has\na dominating induced C6 or a dominating induced complete bipartite subgraph\n(again by giving a constructive proof). This class consists of graphs that, apart\nfrom P6, have exactly one more forbidden induced subgraph. This generalizes a\nresult in [2].\nAs an application of our main result, we consider the Hypergraph 2-\nColorability problem in Section 4. It is well-known that this problem is NP-\ncomplete in general (cf. [10]). We prove that for the class of hypergraphs with\nP6-free incidence graphs the problem becomes polynomially solvable. Moreover,\nwe show that for any 2-colorable hypergraph H with a P6-free incidence graph,\nwe can find a 2-coloring of H in polynomial time.\nSection 5 contains the conclusions, discusses a number of related results in\nthe literature and mentions open problems.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe use the following terminology throughout the paper for a graph G = (V,E).\nWe say that an order pi = x1, . . . , x|V | of V is connected if Gi := G[{x1, . . . , xi}]\n3\nis connected for i = 1, . . . , |V |. Let w \u2208 V and D \u2286 V . Then NG(w) denotes\nthe set of neighbors of w in G. We write ND(w) := NG(w) \u2229D and NG(D) :=\n\u222au\u2208DNG(u)\\D. If no confusion is possible, we write N(w) (respectively N(D))\ninstead of NG(w) (respectively NG(D)). A vertex v\u2032 \u2208 V \\D is called a D-private\nneighbor (or simply private neighbor if no confusion is possible) of a vertex v \u2208 D\nif ND(v\u2032) = {v}.\nLet u, v be a pair of adjacent vertices in a dominating set D of a graph\nG such that {u, v} dominates D. We call a dominating set D\u2032 \u2286 D of G a\nminimizer of D for uv if {u, v} \u2286 D\u2032 and each vertex of D\u2032\\{u, v} has a D\u2032-\nprivate neighbor in G. We can obtain such a minimizer D\u2032 from D in polynomial\ntime by repeatedly removing vertices without private neighbor from D\\{u, v}.\nThis can be seen as follows. It is clear that D\u2032 dominates all vertices in V (G)\\D,\nsince we only remove a vertex from D\\{u, v} if all its neighbors outside D are\ndominated by remaining vertices in D. Moreover, since {u, v} dominates D, all\nvertices removed from D\\{u, v} are dominated by {u, v}. Note that the fact that\nu and v are adjacent means that the graph G[D\u2032] is connected. We point out that\nD may have several minimizers for the same edge uv depending on the order in\nwhich its vertices are considered.\nExample. Consider the graph G and its connected dominating set D in the left-\nhand side of Figure 2. All private neighbors are colored black. The set D\u2032 in the\nright-hand side is a minimizer of D for uv obtained by removing w4 from D. Note\nthat u does not have a D\u2032-private neighbor but v does. Instead of removing w4\nwe could also have chosen to remove w2 first, since w2 does not have a D-private\nneighbor. Let D1 := D\\{w2}. Since w3 does not have a D1-private neighbor, we\ncan remove w3 from D1. The resulting set D2 := D1\\{w3} is a minimizer of D\nfor uv in which every vertex of D2 (including u) has a D2-private neighbor.\nu v w1 w2 w3 w4 u v w1 w2 w3 w4\nD D\n\u2032\nFig. 2. A dominating set D and a minimizer D\u2032 of D for uv.\n3 Finding connected dominating subgraphs in P6-free\ngraphs\nLet G be a connected P6-free graph. We say that D is a type 1 dominating set\nof G if D dominates G and G[D] is an induced C6. We say that D is a type\n2 dominating set of G defined by A(D) and B(D) if D dominates G and G[D]\ncontains a spanning complete bipartite subgraph with partition classes A(D)\nand B(D).\n4\nTheorem 7. If G is a connected P6-free graph, then we can find a type 1 or\ntype 2 dominating set of G in polynomial time.\nProof. Let G = (V,E) be a connected P6-free graph with connected order pi =\nx1, . . . , x|V |. Recall that we write Gi := G[{x1, . . . , xi}], and note that Gi is\nconnected and P6-free for every i. For every 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n we want to find a type 1\nor type 2 dominating set Di of Gi. Let D2 := {x1, x2}. Suppose i \u2265 3. Assume\nDi\u22121 is a type 1 or type 2 dominating set of Gi\u22121. We show how we can use\nDi\u22121 to find Di in polynomial time. Since the total number of iterations is |V |,\nwe then find a desired dominating subgraph of G|V | = G in polynomial time.\nWe write x := xi. If x \u2208 N(Di\u22121), then we set Di := Di\u22121. Suppose otherwise.\nSince pi is connected, Gi contains a vertex y (not in Di\u22121) adjacent to x.\nCase 1. Di\u22121 is a type 1 dominating set of Gi\u22121.\nWe write G[Di\u22121] = c1c2c3c4c5c6c1. We claim that D := NDi\u22121(y) \u222a {x, y}\ndominates Gi, which means that Di := D is a type 2 dominating set of Gi\ndefined by A(Di) := {y} and B(Di) := {x} \u222a NDi\u22121(y). Suppose D does not\ndominate Gi, and let z \u2208 V (Gi) be a vertex not dominated by D. Since Di\u22121\ndominates Gi\u22121, we may without loss of generality assume that yc1 \u2208 E(Gi).\nSuppose yc4 \u2208 E(Gi). Note that z is dominated by Gi\u22121. Without loss of\ngenerality, assume z is adjacent to c2. Consequently, y is not adjacent to c2.\nSince z is not adjacent to any neighbor of y and the path zc2c1yc4c5 cannot\nbe induced in Gi, either z or y must be adjacent to c5. If zc5 \u2208 E(Gi), then\nxyc4c5zc2 is an induced P6 in Gi. Hence zc5 \/\u2208 E(Gi) and yc5 \u2208 E(Gi). In case\nzc6 \u2208 E(Gi) we obtain an induced path xyc5c6zc2 on six vertices, and in case\nzc6 \/\u2208 E(Gi) we obtain an induced path zc2c1c6c5c4. We conclude yc4 \/\u2208 E(Gi).\nSuppose y is not adjacent to any vertex in {c3, c5}. Since Gi is P6-free and\nxyc1c2c3c4 is a P6 in Gi, y must be adjacent to c2. But then xyc2c3c4c5 is an\ninduced P6 in Gi, a contradiction. Hence y is adjacent to at least one vertex in\n{c3, c5}, say yc5 \u2208 E(Gi). By symmetry (using c5, c2 instead of c1, c4) we find\nyc2 \/\u2208 E(Gi).\nSuppose z is adjacent to c2. The path zc2c1yc5c4 on six vertices and the P6-\nfreeness of Gi imply zc4 \u2208 E(Gi). But then c2zc4c5yx is an induced P6. Hence\nzc2 \/\u2208 E(Gi). Also zc4 \/\u2208 E(Gi) as otherwise zc4c5yc1c2 would be an induced P6,\nand zc3 \/\u2208 E(Gi) as otherwise zc3c2c1yx would be an induced P6. Then z must\nbe adjacent to c6 yielding an induced path zc6c1c2c3c4 on six vertices. Hence we\nmay choose Di := D.\nCase 2. Di\u22121 is a type 2 dominating set of Gi\u22121.\nSince Di\u22121 dominates Gi\u22121, we may assume that y is adjacent to some vertex\na \u2208 A(Di\u22121). Let b \u2208 B(Di\u22121). Let D be a minimizer of Di\u22121 \u222a{y} for ab (note\nthat {a, b} dominates Di\u22121 \u222a {y}). By definition, D dominates Gi. Also, G[D]\ncontains a spanning (not necessarily complete) bipartite graph with partition\nclasses A \u2286 A(Di\u22121), B \u2286 B(Di\u22121) \u222a {y}. Note that we have y \u2208 D, because x\nis not adjacent to Di\u22121 and therefore is a D-private neighbor of y. Since y might\n5\nnot have any neighbors in B but does have a neighbor (vertex a) in A, we chose\ny \u2208 B.\nClaim 1. If G[D] contains an induced P4 starting in y and ending in some r \u2208 A,\nthen we can find a type 1 or a type 2 dominating set Di of Gi in polynomial time.\nWe prove Claim 1 as follows. Suppose ypqr is an induced path in G[D] with r \u2208\nA. SinceD is a minimizer ofDi\u22121\u222a{y} for ab and r \u2208 D\\{a, b}, r has aD-private\nneighbor s by definition. Since xypqrs is a path on six vertices and x \/\u2208 N(Di\u22121)\nholds, x must be adjacent to s. We first show that D1 := ND(y) \u222a {x, y, q, r, s}\ndominates Gi. See Figure 3 for an illustration of the graph G[D1]. Suppose D1\nx\ny\np\nq\nr\ns\nND(y)\\{p}\nFig. 3. The graph G[D1].\ndoes not dominate G. Then there exists a vertex z \u2208 N(D)\\N(D1). Note that\nG[(D\\{y})\u222a{z}] is connected because the edge ab makes D\\{y} connected and\n{a, b} dominates D. Let P be a shortest path in G[(D\\{y}) \u222a {z}] from z to a\nvertex p1 \u2208 ND(y) (possibly p1 = p). Since z \/\u2208 N(D1) and p1 \u2208 D1, we have\n|V (P )| \u2265 3. This means that Pyxs is an induced path on at least six vertices,\nunless r \u2208 V (P ) (since r is adjacent to s). However, if r \u2208 V (P ), then the\nsubpath z\n\u2212\u2192\nP r of P from z to r has at least three vertices (because z \/\u2208 N(D1)).\nThis means that z\n\u2212\u2192\nP rsxy contains an induced P6, a contradiction. Hence D1\ndominates Gi.\nTo find a type 1 or type 2 dominating set Di of Gi, we transform D1 into Di\nas follows. Suppose q has a D1-private neighbor q\u2032. Then q\u2032qpyxs is an induced\nP6 in Gi, a contradiction. Hence q has no D1-private neighbor and the set D2 :=\nD1\\{q} still dominates Gi. Similarly, r has no D2-private neighbor r\u2032, since\notherwise r\u2032rsxyp would be an induced P6 in Gi. So the set D3 := D2\\{r} also\ndominates Gi. Now suppose s does not have a D3-private neighbor. Then the\nset D3\\{s} dominates Gi. In that case, we find a type 2 dominating set Di of\nGi defined by A(Di) := {y} and B(Di) := ND(y) \u222a {x}. Assume that s has a\nD3-private neighbor s\u2032 in Gi. Let D4 := D3 \u222a {s\u2032}.\nSuppose ND(y)\\{p} contains a vertex p2 that has a D4-private neighbor p\u20322.\nThen p\u20322p2yxss\n\u2032 is an induced P6, contradicting the P6-freeness of Gi. Hence\nwe can remove all vertices of ND(y)\\{p} from D4, and the resulting set D5 :=\n{p, y, x, s, s\u2032} still dominates Gi. We claim that D6 := D5 \u222a {q} is a type 1\ndominating set of Gi. Clearly, D6 dominates Gi, since D5 \u2286 D6. Since qpyxss\u2032\n6\nis a P6 and qpyxs is induced, q must be adjacent to s\u2032. Hence D6 is a type 1\ndominating set of Gi, and we choose Di := D6. This proves Claim 1.\nLet A1 := NA(y) and A2 := A\\A1. Let B1 := NB(y) and B2 := B\\(B1 \u222a {y}).\nSince a \u2208 A1, we have A1 6= \u2205. If A2 = \u2205, then we define a type 2 dominating\nset Di of Gi by A(Di) := A and B(Di) := B. Suppose A2 6= \u2205. Note |B| \u2265 2,\nbecause {b, y} \u2286 B. If B2 = \u2205, then we define Di by A(Di) := A \u222a {y} and\nB(Di) := B1 = B\\{y}. Suppose B2 6= \u2205. If G[A1 \u222a A2] contains a spanning\ncomplete bipartite graph with partition classes A1 and A2, we define Di by\nA(Di) := A1 and B(Di) := A2 \u222aB. Hence we may assume that there exist two\nnon-adjacent vertices a1 \u2208 A1 and a2 \u2208 A2. Let b\u2217 \u2208 B2. Then ya1b\u2217a2 is an\ninduced P4 starting in y and ending in a vertex of A. By Claim 1, we can find a\ntype 1 or type 2 dominating set Di of Gi in polynomial time. This finishes the\nproof of Theorem 7. uunionsq\nWe will now prove our main theorem.\nTheorem 6. A graph G is P6-free if and only if each connected induced subgraph\nof G contains a dominating induced C6 or a dominating (not necessarily induced)\ncomplete bipartite graph. Moreover, we can find such a dominating subgraph in\npolynomial time.\nProof. Let G be a graph. Suppose G is not P6-free. Then G contains an induced\nP6 which contains neither a dominating induced C6 nor a dominating complete\nbipartite graph. Suppose G is P6-free. Let H be a connected induced subgraph\nof G. Then H is P6-free as well. We apply Theorem 7 to H. uunionsq\nThe characterization in Theorem 6 is minimal due to the existence of the follow-\ning family F of P6-free graphs. For each i \u2265 2, let Fi \u2208 F be the graph obtained\nfrom a complete bipartite subgraph with partition classes Xi = {x1, . . . , xi} and\nYi = {y1, . . . , yi} by adding the edge x1x2 as well as for each h = 1, . . . , i a\nnew vertex x\u2032h only adjacent to xh and a new vertex y\n\u2032\nh only adjacent to yh (see\nFigure 4 for the graph F3).\nx1 x2 x3\ny1 y2 y3\nFig. 4. The graph F3.\nNote that each Fi is P6-free and that the smallest connected dominating sub-\ngraph of Fi is Fi[Xi\u222aYi], which contains a spanning complete bipartite subgraph.\n7\nAlso note that none of the graphs Fi contain a dominating induced complete bi-\npartite subgraph due to the edge x1x2.\nWe conclude this section by characterizing the class of graphs for which each\nconnected induced subgraph contains a dominating induced C6 or a dominating\ninduced complete bipartite subgraph. Again, we will show how to find these\ndominating induced subgraphs in polynomial time. Let CL3 denote the graph\nobtained from the cycle c1c2c3c1 by adding three new vertices b1, b2, b3 and three\nnew edges c1b1, c2b2, c3b3 (see Figure 5).\nc1\nb1\nc2\nb2\nc3\nb3\nFig. 5. The graph CL3 .\nTheorem 8. If G is a connected graph in Forb({CL3 , P6}), then we can find a\ndominating induced C6 or a dominating induced complete bipartite subgraph of\nG in polynomial time.\nProof. Let G = (V,E) be a connected graph in Forb({CL3 , P6}) with connected\norder pi = x1, . . . , x|V |. Recall that we write Gi := G[{x1, . . . , xi}], and note\nthat Gi \u2208 Forb({CL3 , P6}) for every i. For every 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n we want to find a\ndominating setDi ofGi that either induces a C6 or a complete bipartite subgraph\nin Gi. Let D2 := {x1, x2}. Suppose i \u2265 3. Assume Di\u22121 induces a dominating\nC6 or a dominating complete bipartite subgraph in Gi\u22121. We show how we can\nuse Di\u22121 to find Di in polynomial time. Since the total number of iterations is\n|V |, we find a desired dominating subgraph of G|V | = G in polynomial time.\nWe write x := xi. If x \u2208 N(Di\u22121), then we set Di := Di\u22121. Suppose otherwise.\nSince pi is connected, Gi contains a vertex y (not in Di\u22121) adjacent to x. We\nfirst prove a useful claim.\nClaim 1. If NDi\u22121(y) \u222a {x, y} dominates Gi, then we can find a dominating in-\nduced C6 or a dominating induced complete bipartite subgraph of G in polynomial\ntime.\nWe prove Claim 1 as follows. Suppose D\u2217 := NDi\u22121(y) \u222a {x, y} dominates Gi.\nWe check whether G[D\u2217] is complete bipartite. If so, then we choose Di := D\u2217\nand we are done. Otherwise y has a neighbor u in Di\u22121 with ND\u2217(u)\\{y} 6= \u2205.\nIf u has no D\u2217-private neighbor, then we remove u from D\u2217 and perform the\nsame check in the smaller set D\u2217\\{u}. Let u\u2032 be a D\u2217-private neighbor of u\nin Gi. Let v \u2208 ND\u2217(u)\\{y}. Then u\u2032 is adjacent to any D\u2217-private neighbor\n8\nv\u2032 of v, as otherwise G[{u, v, y, u\u2032, v\u2032, x}] is isomorphic to CL3 . So we find that\nD1 := (D\u2217\\ND\u2217(u)) \u222a {y, u\u2032} dominates Gi. If u\u2032 does not have a D1-private\nneighbor, then we remove u\u2032 from D1, check if y is adjacent to two neighbors\nin the smaller set D1\\{u\u2032} and repeat the above procedure. Let u\u2032\u2032 be a D1-\nprivate neighbor of u\u2032. Suppose ND1(y) = {x, u}. Then D1 = {x, y, u, u\u2032}. If x\ndoes not have a D1-private neighbor, then we choose Di := {y, u, u\u2032}. If x has a\nD1-private neighbor x\u2032, then the P6-freeness of Gi implies that x\u2032 is adjacent to\nu\u2032\u2032, and we choose Di := {x\u2032, x, y, u, u\u2032, u\u2032\u2032}.\nSuppose ND1(y)\\{x, u} 6= \u2205, say y is adjacent to some vertex t \u2208 D1\\{x, u}.\nIf t does not have a D1-private neighbor, then we remove t from D1 and check\nif y is adjacent to some vertex in the smaller set D1\\{x, u, t}. Let t\u2032 be a D1-\nprivate neighbor of t. Then the path u\u2032\u2032u\u2032uytt\u2032 is an induced P6 of Gi, unless u\u2032\u2032\nis adjacent to t\u2032. However, in that case xyuu\u2032u\u2032\u2032t\u2032 is an induced P6. This finishes\nthe proof of Claim 1.\nCase 1. Di\u22121 induces a dominating C6 in Gi\u22121.\nSince Di\u22121 is a type 1 dominating set of Gi\u22121, we know from the corresponding\nCase 1 in the proof of Theorem 7 that D := NDi\u22121(y)\u222a{x, y} dominates Gi. By\nClaim 1, we can find a dominating induced C6 or a dominating induced complete\nbipartite subgraph of G in polynomial time.\nCase 2. Di\u22121 induces a dominating complete bipartite subgraph in\nGi\u22121.\nLet A(Di\u22121) and B(Di\u22121) denote the partition classes of Di\u22121. Note that both\nA(Di\u22121) and B(Di\u22121) are independent sets. Since Di\u22121 dominates Gi\u22121, we may\nwithout loss of generality assume that y is adjacent to some vertex a \u2208 A(Di\u22121).\nLet b \u2208 B(Di\u22121). Let D be a minimizer of Di\u22121 \u222a {y} for ab. By definition,\nD dominates Gi. Also, G[D] contains a spanning (not necessarily complete)\nbipartite graph with partition classes A \u2286 A(Di\u22121) and B \u2286 B(Di\u22121) \u222a {y}.\nNote that y \u2208 D, because x is not adjacent to Di\u22121 and therefore is a D-private\nneighbor of y, and consequently, y \u2208 B because y is adjacent to a \u2208 A (and y\nmight not have any neighbors in B). Let A1 := NA(y) and A2 := A\\A1. Let\nB1 := NB(y) and B2 := B\\(B1 \u222a {y}). Since a \u2208 A1, we have A1 6= \u2205.\nSuppose G[D] contains an induced P4 starting in y and ending in a vertex\nin A. Just as in the proof of Theorem 7 we can obtain (in polynomial time)\na dominating C6 of Gi or else we find that ND(y) \u222a {x, y}, and consequently,\nNDi\u22121(y)\u222a{x, y} dominates Gi. In the first case, we choose Di to be the obtained\ndominating induced C6. In the second case, we can find a dominating induced C6\nor a dominating induced complete bipartite subgraph of G in polynomial time\nby Claim 1. So we may assume that G[D] does not contain such an induced P4.\nThis means that at least one of the sets A2, B2 is empty, as otherwise we find\nan induced path yab2a2 for any a2 \u2208 A2 and b2 \u2208 B2. We may without loss of\ngenerality assume that A2 = \u2205. (Otherwise, in case B2 = \u2205, we obtain B = B1,\nwhich means that y is adjacent to b as well, so we can reverse the role of A and\nB.) If B2 = \u2205, then we find that A1 \u222a B1 \u222a {y} \u2282 NDi\u22121(y) \u222a {x, y} dominates\nGi, and we are done as a result of Claim 1. So B2 6= \u2205. Let b2 \u2208 B2.\n9\nWe claim that D2 := A1 \u222a B2 \u222a {x, y} dominates Gi. Suppose otherwise.\nThen there exists a vertex b\u20321 adjacent to some vertex b1 \u2208 B1 but not adjacent\nto D2. Then G[{y, a, b1, x, b2, b\u20321}] is isomorphic to CL3 , a contradiction. Hence\nD2 dominates Gi. If x does not have a D2-private neighbor, then we can choose\nDi := D2\\{x}, since G[Di] is a complete bipartite graph with partition classes\nA1 and B2 \u222a {y}. Suppose x has a D2-private neighbor x\u2032. If b2 does not have a\nD2-private neighbor, then we remove b2 from D2, and check whether B2 contains\nanother vertex (if not we are done, i.e., we can choose Di := A1 \u222a {x, y}, since\nG[Di] is a complete bipartite graph with partition classes A1 \u222a {x} and {y}).\nSuppose b2 has a D2-private neighbor b\u20322. Then the path x\n\u2032xyab2b\u20322 is a path on\nsix vertices, so we must have x\u2032b\u20322 \u2208 E.\nWe claim that D3 := {x\u2032, x, y, a, b2, b\u20322} dominates Gi. Suppose otherwise.\nThen there exists a vertex c\u2032 adjacent to some vertex c in A1 \u222a B2 but not\nadjacent to a vertex in D3. Suppose c \u2208 A1. Then c\u2032cb2b\u20322x\u2032x is an induced P6.\nSuppose c \u2208 B2. Then c\u2032cayxx\u2032 is an induced P6. So D3 dominates Gi. Since\nD3 also induces a C6 in Gi, we may choose Di := D3. This finishes the proof of\nTheorem 8. uunionsq\nTheorem 9 is an immediate result of Theorem 8 together with the observation\nthat neither the graph P6 nor CL3 has a dominating induced C6 or a dominating\ninduced complete bipartite subgraph.\nTheorem 9. A graph G is in Forb({CL3 , P6}) if and only if each connected\ninduced subgraph of G contains a dominating induced C6 or a dominating induced\ncomplete bipartite graph. Moreover, we can find such a dominating subgraph in\npolynomial time.\nBacso\u00b4, Michalak and Tuza [2] prove (non-constructively) that a graph G is in\nForb({CL3 , C6, P6}) if and only if each connected induced subgraph of G contains\na dominating induced complete bipartite graph. Note that Theorem 9 immedi-\nately implies this result.\n4 The Hypergraph 2-Colorability problem\nA hypergraph is a pair (Q,S) consisting of a set Q = {q1, . . . , qm} and a set\nS = {S1, . . . , Sn} of subsets of Q. With a hypergraph (Q,S) we associate its\nincidence graph I, which is a bipartite graph with partition classes Q and S,\nwhere for any q \u2208 Q,S \u2208 S we have qS \u2208 E(I) if and only if q \u2208 S. For any\nS \u2208 S, we write H \u2212 S := (Q,S\\S). A 2-coloring of a hypergraph (Q,S) is a\npartition (Q1, Q2) of Q such that Q1 \u2229 Sj 6= \u2205 and Q2 \u2229 Sj 6= \u2205 for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\nThe Hypergraph 2-Colorability problem asks whether a given hyper-\ngraph has a 2-coloring. This is a well-known NP-complete problem (cf. [10]). Let\nH6 denote the class of hypergraphs with P6-free incidence graphs.\nTheorem 10. The Hypergraph 2-Colorability problem restricted to H6 is\npolynomially solvable. Moreover, for any 2-colorable hypergraph H \u2208 H6 we can\nfind a 2-coloring of H in polynomial time.\n10\nProof. Let H = (Q,S) \u2208 H6, and let I be the (P6-free) incidence graph of H.\nWe assume that I is connected, as otherwise we just proceed component-wise.\nClaim 1. We may without loss of generality assume that S does not contain two\nsets Si, Sj with Si \u2286 Sj.\nWe prove Claim 1 as follows. Suppose Si, Sj \u2208 S with Si \u2286 Sj . Note that we\ncan check in polynomial time whether such sets Si, Sj exist. We show that H is\n2-colorable if and only if H \u2212 Sj is 2-colorable. Clearly, if H is 2-colorable then\nH\u2212Sj is 2-colorable. Suppose H\u2212Sj is 2-colorable. Let (Q1, Q2) be a 2-coloring\nof H \u2212 Sj . By definition, Si \u2229 Q1 6= \u2205 and Si \u2229 Q2 6= \u2205. Since Si \u2286 Sj , we also\nhave Sj \u2229Q1 6= \u2205 and Sj \u2229Q2 6= \u2205, so (Q1, Q2) is a 2-coloring of H. This proves\nClaim 1.\nBy Theorem 6, we can find a type 1 or type 2 dominating setD of I in polynomial\ntime. Since I is bipartite, G[D] is bipartite. Let A and B be the partition classes\nof G[D]. Since I is connected, we may without loss of generality assume A \u2286 Q\nand B \u2286 S. Let A\u2032 := Q\\A and B\u2032 := S\\B. We distinguish two cases.\nCase 1. D is a type 1 dominating set of I.\nWe write I[D] = q1S1q2S2q3S3q1, so A = {q1, q2, q3} and B = {S1, S2, S3}.\nSuppose A\u2032 = \u2205, so Q = {q1, q2, q3}. Obviously, H has no 2-coloring. Suppose\nA\u2032 6= \u2205 and let q\u2032 \u2208 A\u2032. Since D dominates I, q\u2032 has a neighbor, say S1, in B. If\nS2 and S3 both have no neighbors in A\u2032, then q\u2032S1q2S2q3S3 is an induced P6 in\nI, a contradiction. Hence at least one of them, say S2, has a neighbor in A\u2032.\nWe claim that the partition (Q1, Q2) of Q with Q1 := A\u2032 \u222a {q1} and Q2 :=\n{q2, q3} is a 2-coloring of H. We have to check that every S \u2208 S has a neighbor\nin both Q1 and Q2. Recall that S1 has neighbors q1 and q2 and S3 has neighbors\nq1 and q3, so S1 and S3 are OK. Since S2 is adjacent to q2 and has a neighbor\nin A\u2032, S2 is also OK. It remains to check the vertices in B\u2032. Let S \u2208 B\u2032. Since\nD dominates I and I is bipartite, S has at least one neighbor in A. Suppose S\nhas exactly one neighbor, say q1, in A. Then Sq1S1q2S2q3 is an induced P6 in\nI, a contradiction. Hence S has at least two neighbors in A. The only problem\noccurs if S is adjacent to q2 and q3 but not to q1. However, since S2 is adjacent\nto q2 and q3, S must have a neighbor in A\u2032 due to Claim 1. Hence (Q1, Q2) is a\n2-coloring of H.\nCase 2. D is a type 2 dominating set of I.\nSuppose A\u2032 = \u2205. Then |B| = 1 as a result of Claim 1. Let B = {S} and q \u2208 A.\nSince S is adjacent to all vertices in A, we find that B\u2032 = \u2205 as a result of Claim\n1. Hence H has no 2-coloring if |A| = 1, and H has a 2-coloring ({q}, A\\{q}) if\n|A| \u2265 2. Suppose A\u2032 6= \u2205. We claim that (A,A\u2032) is a 2-coloring of H. This can\nbe seen as follows. By definition, each vertex in S is adjacent to a vertex in A.\nSuppose |B| = 1 and let B = {S}. Since S dominates Q and A\u2032 6= \u2205, S has at\nleast one neighbor in A\u2032. Suppose |B| \u2265 2. Since every vertex in B is adjacent\nto all vertices in A, every vertex in S must have a neighbor in A\u2032 as a result of\nClaim 1. uunionsq\n11\n5 Conclusions\nThe key contributions of this paper are the following. We presented a new char-\nacterization of the class of P6-free graphs, which strengthens results of Liu and\nZhou [14] and Liu, Peng and Zhao [15]. We used an algorithmic technique to\nprove this characterization. Our main algorithm efficiently finds for any given\nconnected P6-free graph a dominating subgraph that is either an induced C6\nor a (not necessarily induced) complete bipartite graph. Besides these main re-\nsults, we also showed that our characterization is \u201cminimal\u201d in the sense that\nthere exists an infinite family of P6-free graphs for which a smallest connected\ndominating subgraph is a (not induced) complete bipartite graph. We also char-\nacterized the class Forb({CL3 , P6}) in terms of connected dominating subgraphs,\nthereby generalizing a result of Bacso\u00b4, Michalak and Tuza [2].\nOur main algorithm can be useful to determine the computational complex-\nity of decision problems restricted to the class of P6-free graphs. To illustrate\nthis, we applied this algorithm to prove that theHypergraph 2-Colorability\nproblem is polynomially solvable for the class of hypergraphs with P6-free inci-\ndence graphs. Are there any other decision problems for which the algorithm is\nuseful? In recent years, several authors studied the classical k-Colorability\nproblem for the class of P`-free graphs for various combinations of k and ` [13,\n16, 18]. The 3-Colorability problem is proven to be polynomially solvable for\nthe class of P6-free graphs [16]. Hoa`ng et al. [13] show that for all fixed k \u2265 3\nthe k-Colorability problem becomes polynomially solvable for the class of\nP5-free graphs. They pose the question whether there exists a polynomial time\nalgorithm to determine if a P6-free graph can be 4-colored. We do not know yet\nif our main algorithm can be used for simplifying the proof of the result in [16]\nor for solving the open problem described above. We leave these questions for\nfuture research.\nThe next class to consider is the class of P7-free graphs. Recall that a graph\nG is P7-free if and only if each connected induced subgraph of G contains a\ndominating subgraph of diameter at most three [1]. Using an approach similar\nto the one described in this paper, it is possible to find such a dominating sub-\ngraph in polynomial time. However, a more important question is whether this\ncharacterization of P7-free graphs can be narrowed down. Also determining the\ncomputational complexity of the Hypergraph 2-Colorability problem for\nthe class of hypergraphs with P7-free incidence graphs is still an open problem.\nFinally, a natural problem for a given graph class deals with its recognition.\nWe are not aware of any recognition algorithms for (even bipartite or triangle-\nfree) P7-free graphs that have a better running time than the trivial algorithm\nthat checks for every 7-tuple of vertices whether they induce a path. This might\nbe another interesting direction for future research, considering the following\nresults on recognition of (subclasses of) P6-free graphs. Fouquet [9] presents\na cubic recognition algorithm for the class of P6-free graphs (in an internal\nreport). Giakoumakis and Vanherpe [11] show that bipartite P6-free graphs can\nbe recognized in linear time. They do this by extending the techniques developed\nin [6] for linear time recognition of P4-free graphs (also see [12]) and by using\n12\na characterization of P6-free graphs in terms of canonical decomposition trees\n(which is not related to our characterization) from [9]. Brandsta\u00a8dt, Klembt and\nMahfud [4] show that triangle-free P6-free graphs have bounded clique-width.\nThe recognition algorithm they obtain from this result runs in quadratic time.\nSince the class of P6-free graphs has unbounded clique-width (cf. [3]), their\ntechnique cannot be applied to find a quadratic recognition algorithm for the\nclass of P6-free graphs.\nReferences\n1. G. Bacso\u00b4 and Zs. Tuza.
