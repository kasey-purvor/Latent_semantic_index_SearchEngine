Biological explanations of this difference have \nbeen presented but there has been little exploration of social factors. In this paper \nwe use data from Carletonville, South Africa to explore various social explanations \nfor greater female infection rates. This paper reports on data from a random sample \nof 507 people between 13 and 24 years old. Subjects were tested for HIV, as well as \nother sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and answered a behavioural \nquestionnaire. The age-prevalence of HIV infection differs between men and women \nwith considerably higher rates of increase with age among young women. The age of \nsexual debut did not differ significantly between men and women (15.9 and 16.3 \nyears, respectively) and below the age of 20 years there was no difference in the \nnumber or distribution of the number of sexual partners reported by men or \nwomen. The risk of infection per partnership was substantially higher among \nwomen than among men. Women have sexual partners who are, on average, about \nfive years older than they are with some variation with age. Scaling the age-\nprevalence curve for men by the age of their sexual partners gives a curve whose \nshape is indistinguishable from that for women but is about 30% lower for men \nthan for women. In terms of social explanations for HIV rates among women, the \ndata indicates that this difference can be explained by the relative age of sexual \npartners, but not by other factors explored. In addressing the epidemic among \nyoung women it will be essential to deal with the social factors that lead young \nwomen to select their partners from older-age cohorts and that shape their sexual \nnetworking patterns. \n \n \nKEYWORDS: HIV, age prevalence, gender differences, young people, young women, \npartner age differences \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nIn many countries, but especially in those of sub- Saharan Africa, the \nprevalence of HIV continues to increase and among women attending \nante-natal clinics has reached 36% in both Botswana1 and in \nKwaZulu\/Natal, South Africa2 for example. While the spread of \ninfection has been contained in Thailand and Senegal and the \nprevalence of infection in Uganda has fallen over the last 10 \nyears3, few other countries have succeeded in stemming the tide of \ninfection. At the same time, HIV prevention is receiving \nunprecedented support from world leaders4 and in his \u2018call to action\u2019 \nthe Secretary General of the United Nations stressed the importance of \npreventing young people from becoming infected, noting also that \nadolescent girls are six times more likely to be infected than are \nadolescent boys5. It is now widely acknowledged that young people, \nand especially young women between the ages of 15 and 25 years of age, \nconstitute a particularly important group for HIV prevention. \n \nThe focus on adolescents and young adults arises for three reasons. First, \nthe age-specific incidence of infection is highest among this group6. \nSecondly, there is increasing evidence that the incidence of infection is \nhigher among young women than it is among young men7. Thirdly, the \nrapid rate of increase of infection with age among young women in \nparticular means that this group provides the best evidence for the \nimpact of interventions, as illustrated by the decline in infection \namong 13-19-year-old women in Masaka, Uganda between 1990 and \n19978. \n \nTwo sorts of explanation have been offered to explain the different \npatterns of infection in men and women: biological explanations \nrelating to differences in male and female genital physiology and the \nconsequent differences in susceptibility to infection, and social or \nbehavioural explanations related to the nature and patterns of sexual \nrelationships among young people. A number of studies have shown \nthat male-to-female transmission is more likely (per sex act) than the \nreverse9-18. Rehle et al. having reviewed the available data for their \nAvert Model, reckon that male-to-female transmission (per sex act) is \napproximately twice as likely as female-to-male transmission if no other \nsexually transmitted infections are present19. If either partner has a \ngenital ulcer they set the male-to-female transmission probability at \nfour times the female-to-male transmission. Nicolosi et al. reporting on \na study carried out across 16 clinical settings in Italy20,21, conclude \nthat male-to- female transmission is 2.3 times more likely than female-\nto-male transmission (confidence limits 1.1- 4.8), and in a study carried \nout in nine European countries, male-to-female transmission was 1.9 \ntimes more likely than female-to-male transmission (confidence limits \n1.1-3.3)22. Similar results have been obtained in other studies23,24. A \nrecent study of initially discordant couples in Uganda found a \ntransmission rate from men to women that was only 0.78 times that \nfrom women to men, but 95% confidence limits on their estimate have a \nrange of 0.62-2.68, so that these data too are consistent with male-to-\nfemale transmissibility being about twice female-to-male \ntransmissibility. \n \nTwo major biological reasons have been put forward to explain this \nasymmetry in transmission. First, differences in the genital contact \nsurfaces mean that coital tearing and injury are more common in \nwomen26,27. Secondly, in unprotected sex, women are exposed to \ninfectious fluids for longer than are men; men are in contact with body \nfluids containing the virus for the duration of the sex act only, while \nwomen remain in contact with semen for much longer20. \n \nWhile these biological factors are clearly important, a number of studies \nsuggest that social and behavioural factors may also be important. In \nattempting to address the social issues implicated in higher HIV rates \namong women than among men, we consider the influence of the age at \nfirst sex, the probability of infection per partnership, the total number \nof sexual partners and the age difference between partners. \n \nIn this paper we first examine the age-prevalence of HIV infection \namong men and women in Khutsong township in the Carletonville \ndistrict of South Africa, and we compare the age-prevalence of infection \nwith similar data from Mutasa, a rural area in Zimbabwe7. The \ndifference in the age- specific prevalence is particularly striking among \nyoung people, with rates in young women greatly in excess of the rates \nin young men of the same age. We then examine various factors that \nmay help to explain these gender differences. These include the age at \nsexual debut, gender difference in the number of sexual partners, and \nthe age differences between sexual partners. \n \nIn a review of the gender differentials in HIV prevalence and AIDS-\nrelated mortality in Africa, Gregson and Garnett draw several \nimportant conclusions 7. They show that the prevalence of infection in \nwomen is generally higher than in men, especially in urban settings: in \n28 studies carried out in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe the \nmedian prevalence of infection was 30% (inter- quartile range 20-40%) \nhigher in women than it was in men. They also show that while the \nprevalence of infection is very much higher in women than in men \nbelow the age of 30 years, above this age the prevalence of infection \nin men tends to be higher than in women. They conclude that the \nhigher levels of infection among young women, as compared to young \nmen, should be used to highlight women\u2019s greater biological and \nsocioeconomic vulnerability, and list several factors that might \ncontribute to gender differences in the patterns of infection, including \nthe age structure of the population, age differences between sexual \npartners, levels and heterogeneity in rates of sexual partner acquisition, \nand relative rates of male-to- female and female-to-male transmission. \nUnfortunately the data needed to explore some of these factors were \nnot available to them and in this paper we use data from Carletonville, \nSouth Africa, to explore some of these issues. \n \nMETHODS \nStudy site \nThe data presented in this paper are part of a broader study of the \nbiological, psychological, behavioural and social determinants of HIV \ntransmission in the mining district of Carletonville, South Africa28, \nwhich is being conducted in the context of a major HIV prevention \nintervention in the district29. The young people who form the focus of \nthis study are residents of Khutsong township, part of the Carletonville \ndistrict, which has a population of approximately 150,000 residents. \nThe township has a number of different housing types that reflect the \nsocioeconomic profile of the community. In the formal sector there are \nboth private homes and council houses, the former owned by their \nresidents and the latter, which were owned by the local municipality, \nnow being bought by their tenants. The informal sector consists of \nunplanned squatter settlements that have mushroomed around the \nformal township, housing either South African citizens or illegal \nimmigrants from other African countries. There are also site-and-service \nareas in which plots provided with water, electricity and sewerage are \nsold, allowing residents to construct shack dwellings with the \nunderstanding that formal owner- constructed units will be developed \nat a later stage. The hardships of unemployment for many and the \nlimited income for the majority of respondents are compounded by the \nstructure of township life. \n \nKhutsong has few entertainment or retail facilities other than informal \nbars and spaza shops (informal points of sale for basic foodstuffs, usually \nwithin private homes or roadside shacks). In addition, the township is \ncharacterized by high levels of violence, particularly towards women, \nand gang-related fighting between different ethnic groups. \n \n \nSurvey \nIn August 1998 a cross-sectional study was conducted in Khutsong. \nCarletonville district has a population of about 150,000 people, in \naddition to which approximately 70,000 migrant mineworkers are \nhoused in 12 single-sex hostels close to the mineshafts to the south of \nCarletonville town30. The survey was designed to collect data on men \nand women aged 13-60 years. Households were selected by a two-stage \nrandom sampling technique. Index houses were randomly selected from \na map obtained from the local municipal offices. Using each index house \nas a starting point, a systematic sample of households was taken. The \nsampling scheme was designed to be self- weighting. All men and \nwomen aged 13-60 years who slept in the selected households the \nnight before the study team visit were eligible for inclusion in the \nstudy. Eligible participants were transported to a local facility for the \ninterviews and the collection of blood and urine samples. If eligible \nparticipants were not at home, the study team made up to three \nrepeat visits before abandoning that household. Altogether 475 men \nand 712 women were included in the study and 173 people (13%) \nrefused to participate. Neither the sex ratio nor the age distribution of \nthose who refused to participate differed from that among those who \nagreed, so that this is unlikely to introduce significant bias. \n  \nQuestionnaire \nA UNAIDS questionnaire was adapted to the local situation and to the \nage of subjects enrolled in the sample31. A consent form was presented \nto participants in their first language and those who agreed to \nparticipate were asked to sign the form. The interviewers completed \nthe questionnaire during a private interview in the preferred language \nof the interviewee. Data were collected on background and behavioural \ncharacteristics, as well as a medical and sexual history. \n \nBiological tests \nFollowing the interview, blood and first-catch urine specimens were \ncollected. A single Capillus HIV- 1\/HIV-2 latex aggregation test \n(Cambridge Biotech Corporation, Galway, Ireland), which has a \nsensitivity and specificity of greater than 99.9% and 99.6%, \nrespectively, was subsequently used to screen the sera for HIV \ninfection. Tests were also done for syphilis serology, gonorrhoea and \nchlamydia32. All participants were offered free treatment for STIs that \nwere detected as a result of the laboratory tests and once this had \nbeen done all individual identifiers were removed from the forms \nand the HIV testing was carried out. All participants were offered a \nseparate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assy (ELISA) test with pre- \nand post-test counselling to be arranged through the normal clinic \nchannels if they wished to know their HIV status. \n \nData management \nLaboratory results and data generated from questionnaires were \nentered twice into a database (Microsoft Access, Redmond, USA) by \ndifferent people. The two entries were compared and discrepancies \nwere corrected. The data were then extensively checked for \ninconsistencies. The files were then imported into the Statistical \nPackage for Social Sciences (SPSS 8.0 for Windows, Chicago, USA) and \nprepared for statistical analysis. \n \nEthical consideration s \nEthical clearance for the study was granted by the University of \nWitwatersrand Ethical Committee, South Africa (Protocol M 970235). \nParticipants gave their written consent to the study and all information \nwas treated confidentially. Biomedical results were linked to \nquestionnaire information through a system of code-numbers that \nremained anonymous. \n \nStatistical methods \nWhere parametric distributions were fitted to the data this was done using \nmaximum likelihood methods with binomial errors33-35. To test for \ndifferences between distributions of the age at first sex, a Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov (K-S) test was used. Principal axis regression was used to \ndetermine the relationship between the ages of male and female sexual \npartners. For comparisons of the number of sexual partners by gender, \nw2  tests were used. \n \nRESULTS \nSince we are concerned with young people in particular, we consider \nthe characteristics of those under the age of 25 years separately. Of \nthe 507 under the age of 25 years 45% (n= 230) were men and 55% \n(n= 277) were women. Of those aged 15- 24, 21% lived in private \nhouses, 25% in council houses, 27% in site-and-service schemes and \n25% in squatter settlements. The majority (55%) of those interviewed \nwere students at local schools or were engaged in some form of tertiary \neducation. Among those no longer studying there were high levels of \nunemployment (30%), as is common among many young township \nresidents. Member- ship of various associations was quite common, \nwith the majority being members of either sports clubs (42%) or youth \norganizations (29%). Finally, of the young people represented in the \nsample, 70% reported having had penetrative sexual intercourse \n(defined as sex in which the penis enters the vagina, anus or mouth). \n \nFigure 1 shows the age-prevalence of infection for men and women in \nCarletonville and, for comparison, the corresponding data from a \nsurvey carried out in a rural area of Zimabwe7. Both sets of data have \nbeen fitted to log-normal functions6,36. In both communities the \nprevalence of infection increases very rapidly with age (especially \namong young women), peaks at older ages among men than among \nwomen and declines thereafter. These two sites represent quite \ndifferent communities \u00d0 Carletonville is an urban mining centre \ndrawing in migrant   workers   from   South   Africa   and   the \nneighbouring states (but not Zimbabwe), Mutasa is a rural area in the \nHonde Valley in the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe. While the age-\nprevalence curves   differ   between   men   and   women, the similarities \nbetween the shapes of the curves for Carletonville and Mutasa  are  \nstriking.  Infection rates increase much more rapidly among women \nthan among men in both sites: in Mutasa, at the age of 20 years the \nprevalence among men and women is   2.7% and   17.8%, respectively \n(odds   ratio (OR)= 7.8,  P50.0001),  in  Cartonville  7.9%  and 39.3%, \nrespectively (OR= 7.5, P50.0001). The infection peaks at an older age \namong men than it does among women in both sites: 31.6 years and \n26.2 years, respectively, in Carletonville (difference= 5.4 years, \nP50.0001), and 35.0 and 28.9 years, respectively in Mutasa (difference= \n6.1 years, P50.0001). However, they do differ in one important respect: \nin Carletonville the peak prevalence among women (57.9%) is \nsignificantly higher than among men (44.5%) (OR= 1.7, P= 0.0057), \nwhile in Mutasa the peak prevalence among women  (35.3%) is very \nclose to that among men (34.7%) (OR= 1.03, P= 0.81).  \n \nFigure 2 shows the data for young men and women in Carletonville to \nillustrate more clearly the differences in the infection rates among \nyoung people.   At   15   years-of-age, for   example, an estimated 0.2% of \nmen and 8% of women are HIV- positive; at 20 years-of-age 11% of men \nand 47% of women are positive. The slope of the age-prevalence curve \ngives a lower bound for the age- specific incidence6 and on this basis the \nincidence peaks at 15% or more among 18-year-old women and 9.6% or \nmore among 24-year-old men. \n \nWe now turn to examining some of the social factors Gregson and \nGarnett outlined as possible explanations for the differences in male \nand female infection rates7. The factors considered include age at sexual \ndebut, number of sexual partners and age difference between sexual \npartners. Finally, we discuss some other factors that may play a role in \nincreased female infection rates and which require further \ninvestigation. \n \nAge at sexual debut \n \nA number of studies have been conducted on the relationship between \nthe age of sexual debut and subsequent sexual activity and STD \ninfections. The potentially harmful effects of a young age at first coitus \nare felt more among young women than among young men37. A study \nindicated that women were more likely than men to regret first coitus \nbefore the age of 16 years and that they were more likely to have been \nan unwilling sex partner. The study also indicated that the risks \nassociated with a young age at first sex were disproportionately felt \namong women in contrast to men. A further study carried out among \nyoung people attending planned-parenthood clinics in Pennsylvania \ncom- pared young women who first became sexually active between \nthe ages of 10 and 14 years with those who became sexually active \nafter the age of 14 years. Those who started sex earlier were more \nlikely to have had a greater number of sexual partners in the previous \nyear, to have had sex with men who were at increased risk for the \ntransmission of HIV and were more likely to have had STDs in the \npreceding five years, than those who did not38. \n \nA study carried out among Ethiopian women found that a young age at \nfirst sex was associated with increased prevalence of STDs and pelvic \ninflammatory disease, as well as being strongly associated with an \nincreased number of sexual partners39. It is important to note that the \nconsequences of early sexual debut will always be confounded by \nassociation with subsequent sexual behaviour. \n \nThe age at sexual debut of young people in Carletonville was assessed \nin two ways. Respondents were asked firstly if they had ever had \npenetrative sex. Plotting the proportion who answered yes as a function \nof age gives the circles in Figure 3a and 3b. The associated line is the \nmaximum likelihood fit to the data using a cumulative normal \ndistribution function. Respondents were also asked how old they \nwere when they first had sex. This gives a probability density function \n(PDF) from which the cumulative distribution is readily obtained and \nis given by the diamonds in Figure 3 (it is important to ensure that the \nright denominators are used since the number of people sampled who \nare less than a given age increased with age). The line associated with \nthe diamonds is the cumulative distribution obtained from the \nmaximum likelihood fit to the PDF. Since these are two independent \nestimates of the same function they should give the same values, \nunless of course there has been a shift in the age at first sex over the last \n5-10 years. It is important to note however, that the first (circle) curve \nis likely to be less biased, given the nature of the question, than the \nsecond (diamond) curve, since the second curve relies on recall. \nHowever, the number of people indicating that they first had sex at an \nearly age will be greater than the number of young people of that age in \nthe sample, so that the second curve will be statistically more precise \nthan the first. \n \nComparing the two curves for men in Figure 3a, they do differ \nsignificantly (K-S test, P50.0001), but the difference in the mean values \nis only 6 months.  Either men exaggerate downwards by about 6 \nmonths when asked, or the age at sexual debut has increased slightly \nin recent years, or some combination of the two. In any event the \ndifference is small. Figure 3b presents the data for women. For women \nwe see that there is much closer agreement between the two estimates \nthat are not significantly different (K-S test, P= 0.942). From the age \ndistribution of the proportion of those who said that they had had sex, \nthe mean age at \n \nFirst sex is 15.9 years (12.0-19.9 years for 95% of the population) for men \nand 16.3 years (12.8-19.8 years for 95% of the population) for women. \nThe age at sexual debut cannot explain the dramatic differences in the \nage-prevalence of HIV infection among men and women in Carletonville. \n \nNumber of sexual partners \nThe increase in the risk of HIV infection with increasing numbers of \nsexual partners has been well documented. In a case-control study \ncarried out among patients attending an STD clinic in Italy, a strong \ncorrelation was found between HIV infection and the number of sexual \npartners although the risk of infection did not increase linearly (at low \nprevalence) with the number of sexual partners because there was a \nsubstantial amount of transmission associated with drug use40. Among \nyoung people in US public high schools an increased number of sexual \npartners was associated with other risk behaviours such as illegal \ndrug use, recklessness and aggression, and was particularly problematic \nin the context of the low levels of condom use in this group41. \nIf young women have proportionately more sexual partners, this too \ncould put them at higher risk of infection than men and Figure 4 shows \nthe proportion of men and women who have various numbers of \nsexual partners for those aged 15-20 years and for those aged 20-25 \nyears. For the younger age-group there is a small, and significant (P= \n0.0025), difference between the proportions of men and women who \nhave different numbers of sexual partners. Girls are less likely to have \nhad no partners and more likely to have had one or two partners than \nboys, but none of the individual comparisons is significant and the \noverall distributions are very similar. For the older age-group women \nare more likely than men to have had between one and four partners \nand less likely than men to have had eight or more partners. This is \nunlikely, therefore, to explain the differences in the infection rates, \nespecially among those under the age of 20 years where the \ndifferences are most marked. \n \nThose with more sexual partners are more likely to be infected than \nthose with fewer sexual partners and Figure 5 shows the prevalence of \ninfection as a function of the number of sexual partners. Among women \nwho report having had one sexual partner, 24% are infected, for those \nwith two partners the figure rises to 45%. For men, on the other hand, \nthe risk increases much more slowly. Among those with one sexual \npartner 8% were infected (fitted curve in Figure 5) and the prevalence \nonly reaches 27% among those who have had eight or more partners. \nThe risk of infection per partnership is about three times greater for \nwomen than it is for men. Since the risk of infection per partnership will \ndepend on a persons\u2019 vulnerability to infection and the prevalence of \ninfection among their sexual partners, we turn to an examination of \nthe sexual mixing patterns of young people in Carletonville, with \nparticular reference to age. \n \nAge difference between sexual partners \nThe age difference between sexual partners is of particular importance \namong young people. Young women tend to have older partners, who \nin turn are more likely to have had multiple partners some of whom \nmay be commercial sex workers, and therefore more likely to be infected \nwith HIV than men of their own age42-44. The economic dependence \nof women on men in Africa has important consequences for their \nsexual health. In Soweto, the largest black township in South Africa, the \ncommercialization of sex in communities where unemployment is \nhigh45, encourages young women to exchange sex for gifts of money, \nclothing, or for living expenses46. Men able to provide these \ncommodities are frequently significantly older than their female \npartners. Konde-Lule et al. consider the impact that the \ncommercialization of sex has on the age difference between partners in \nrural Uganda47. While the partners of male students tend to be \nrestricted to women of their own age or younger, female students often \nhave older partners who are traders or salaried workers who support \nthem financially. \n \nWhen examining the data from Carletonville, women, as expected, have \nsexual partners who are older than themselves with women aged 20 \nyears having partners whose average age is 25.2 years. This pattern \ncontinues beyond the age-groups discussed in this paper, with those \nwomen aged 30 having partners whose average age is 36.4 years, and \nthose aged 40 having partners whose average age is 44.2 years. Since \nwomen have sex with men who are older than them and men have sex \nwith women younger than themselves, young women are more \nvulnerable to infection than young men of their own age. This \nvulnerability is the result of selecting partners from an older age-\ngroup in which the HIV infection rates for men are higher than among \nmen their own age. \n \nTo explore the extent to which this can explain the difference in the \nage-specific prevalence, we used the relationship given by the fitted \nline in Figure 6 to scale the age-prevalence curve for men in Figure 1, \nso that we can plot the prevalence of infection in men against the \naverage age of their sexual partners. In Figure 7 we have plotted the \nprevalence of infection in women against their age and the prevalence \nin men against the age of their sexual partners and scaled the \nprevalence in men up by a factor of 1.3. The agreement between the \ntwo curves is excellent and it is important to note that the only free \nparameter in the fit is the factor of 1.3 by which we have increased the \nprevalence in men. The shapes of the curves are entirely determined by \nthe raw prevalences and the completely independent estimates of the \nrelation- ship between the ages of men and women and their sexual \npartners. \nDISCUSSION \n A wide range of studies have shown that the age- specific prevalence of \nHIV infection in South Africa is quite different among men and among \nwomen7,36. In particular, the prevalence of infection increases much \nmore rapidly among young women than it does among young men, \nimplying that the incidence of infection is much higher among young \nwomen that it is among young men. Under- standing this difference is \nimportant for many reasons, not least because if, as in Carletonville, \nhalf of the young women are infected with HIV by the age of 25 years, \nprotecting young women from infection is of major importance. At the \nsame time, since the slope of the age-prevalence curve for young people \nprovides a sensitive measure of incidence, it is hoped that declines in \nthe rate of increase of prevalence with age among young women will \nprovide a sensitive marker of the success or otherwise of intervention \nprogrammes. But if we are to design interventions specifically targeted \nat helping young women to protect themselves from becoming infected \nwith HIV and to use the rates of infection among young women as a \nmeasure of the effectiveness of control programmes, then it is \nessential to understand the reasons for the high incidence among this \ngroup. \n \nWhile acknowledging biological reason for female susceptibility to \ninfection, in this paper we have explored a number of possible social \nexplanations for this difference in the relative rates of infection in \nyoung men and women. The age at sexual debut or the number of \nsexual partners among young men and women do not differ \nsignificantly and are therefore unlikely to provide an explanation for \nthe different age-pattern s of infection in this setting. The age difference \nbetween sexual partners does have a major effect and this could \nexplain much of the observed difference in the shapes of the age-\nprevalence curves, which then differ only by a scaling factor. \n \nAfter transforming the age-prevalence curve for men according to the \nage of their female sexual partners the prevalence of infection among \nwomen is 30% higher than it is in men and this is consistent with the \nassumption that transmissibility from men to women is greater than \nfrom women to men. Suppose that we assume homogeneous mixing \nand ignore age-structure. Suppose also that the transmissibility \nfrom men to women is greater than the reverse by a factor of f, say. \nThen we can show (Appendix) that early in the epidemic the pre- \nvalence among women will be f1\/2 times the prevalence in men, \nbut that in the steady state the prevalence in women will be almost \nthe same as in men. If, as noted above, f is about two then we \nshould expect the overall prevalence in women to be 40% greater \nthan in men early in the epidemic and about 12% greater than \nmen later in the epidemic (Appendix). Furthermore, the main \ndifference between the age-prevalence curves for Carletonville and \nMutasa (Figure 1) is that the peak prevalence among women is \nhigher than it is among men in Carletonville but not in Mutasa. \nSince the epidemic in Zimbabwe is more advanced than in South Africa \nthis might reflect the natural dynamics of HIV epidemics. It would be \nof interest to apply the analysis carried out in this paper to the data for \nMutasa. \n \nThis paper has been concerned with social explanations of the \ndifference in HIV infection rates between men and women. However, \nresearch that was beyond the scope of the data collected in this paper \nmay provide more insight into the complex interaction of biological and \nsocial factors in Carletonville. In South Africa, where rape and violence \nagainst women are common, imbalances in power relationships \nbetween men and women48-50 can lead to a blurring of the distinction \nbetween \u2018normal\u2019 heterosexual intercourse and rape51. Among \npregnant teenagers in a Cape Town town- ship, 60% said that they had \nbeen beaten by their male partners, and women who had been sexually \nactive for an average of two years said that they had been beaten an \naverage of 10 times52. Our research in Carletonville shows that many \nyoung women are initiated into sexual activity under duress, through \neither coercion or violence, and that continuing sexual violence \nthereafter is not uncommon10. It is possible that high levels of sexual \nviolence may result in women being at particularly high risk of HIV \ninfection during their first sexual encounter due to trauma to the vaginal \nmembranes. Further research would provide interesting insights into \nmore close relationships between social and biological factors \npredisposing women to greater risk of HIV infection. \n \nCONCLUSION \nGarnett and Gregson have shown that in numerous African countries the \nrates of HIV infection among women are greater than among men7. \nUnfortunately, their major data source in Mutasa, Zimbabwe, did not \nprovide information on social factors that could explain observed \ndifferences between male and female rates of infection. Due to the \nsimilarities in the prevalence curves between Mutasa and Carletonville, \nwe have attempted to answer some of the questions they have raised \nusing the Carletonville data. On the basis of the data presented here, \nwe would argue that the increased risk of infection for young women \nas compared to young men is due in part to women\u2019s greater biological \nvulnerability to HIV as compared to men, as has already been \ndocumented else- where, and in part to social factors that lead young \nwomen to select more of their partners from an older age-cohort and \nwhich determines patterns of sexual networking. \n \nThe data from Carletonville indicate that factors such as the age at first \nsex and the number of lifetime partners are not sufficiently different \nbetween the sexes to explain the differential rates of infection. Rather, \nthe age difference between male and female partners indicates that \nsexual networking patterns in this area incline young women to \ninfection through their choice of male partners. The choice of older \nmale partners (possibly for financial security) increases the likelihood \nof young women selecting HIV-positive partners, as prevalence is \nhigher in this male age- group than in those individuals of the same age \nas the women. The data also provide an indication that it is not the \nnumber of partners that create risk for women but rather their risk of \ninfection per partnership. While the heightened risk of infection per \npartnership among women compared to men may   serve   to   confirm   \ntheories   of   increased biological susceptibility, there are further social \nissues that may partially explain this phenomenon.  \n \nThere is increasing evidence both from our own work and from other \nstudies that it is not unusual for sexually inexperienced young women \nto be forced into unwanted sexual encounters and this may exacerbate \ntheir biological vulnerability due to the increased likelihood of female \ngenital damage in forced or coercive sex. While the data presented \nhere suggest that the differences in infection rates can be explained \nwithout appealing to forced or coercive sex, this is an issue that needs \nto be explored in greater detail.  Many authors have pursued \ninvestigations of gender violence against women but most commonly in \nrelation to the effects that this has on the ability to demand condom use \nwithin sexual relationships, or female ability to refuse   unwanted   sex.   \nFurther   investigation   is required into the role that unwanted or \ncoercive sex may have in increasing young women\u2019s already heightened \nvulnerability to HIV infection. \n \n Our study highlights the urgent need to develop effective programmes to reduce \nthe spread of HIV.AIDS among young people and especially to protect young women. \nWhile it is always difficult to measure incidence, especially in the short term, the \nvery high incidence of infection implied by these data also mean that it is among this \nage-group that there is the best hope for detecting a reduction in incidence if \neffective control programmes are implemented. \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements: Thanks to the Department for International \nDevelopment (UK) for their financial contributions to the broader \nintervention programme reported on in this paper, and for funding the \nsurvey outlined above.
