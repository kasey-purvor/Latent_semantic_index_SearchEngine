Introduction \nLasers have the propensity to be employed for the non-contact processing of materials which are otherwise \ndifficult to process. Concrete is one such material since it is a composite, consisting of an array of fine and \ncoarse aggregate pieces embedded within an ordinary Portland cement (OPC) matrix. The laser processing \nof concrete is a field of ongoing research, with many studies having been carried out to investigate the \ntechnique itself and the associated phenomena. Most of the research, however, has concentrated on the laser \ncutting of concrete and reinforced concrete using high power CO2 lasers, most prominently with regard to \nnuclear reactor decommissioning [1]. Work by Sugimoto et al. [2] focused upon modifying the surface \nappearance and surface properties of cement based materials using a high power CO2 laser. The resultant \nphysical characteristics and mechanical behaviour of the post-process cement based materials was later \nfully characterised by Wignarajah et al. [3]. Borodina et al. [4] has carried out investigations into the \nstructural changes within the composition of zirconia concrete caused by surface exposure to CO2 laser \nradiation, detailing microstructural changes, phase changes and the absorptivity characteristics. Yet in all of \nthese studies, spallation and excessive cracking and porosity formation were found to be major problems \nundermining the laser treated surface layer. However, Lawrence and Li [5-7] have treated the OPC surface \nof concrete with both CO2 and high power diode lasers (HPDL). The HPDL generated OPC glaze was \nshown to be more than an effective surface modification insofar as it provided superior mechanical, \nphysical and chemical characteristics over an untreated or CO2 laser treated OPC surface. \n*Corresponding author: tel: +44 161 236-3311; fax: +44 161 200-3803; e-mail: j.lawrence@umist.ac.uk \n  2 \nInvestigations into the effects of different shield gases during the laser processing of materials have hitherto \nfocused mainly on the laser welding and cutting of steels, with other studies examining the laser ablation \ndrilling and surface treatment of numerous metals. These studies have revealed the high degree of influence \nthat the shield gas employed has on the process and end results [8, 9]. In a study into the influence of shield \ngas type on the surface characteristics of the welds generated on steel with a CO2 laser. To date, a number \nof workers have reported on the effects of shield gases during laser drilling. In particular, detailed studies \nby Low et al. [10] revealed that, whereas the use of an O2 shield gas typically caused increased liquid \nparticle ejection coupled with volatile burning, the use of an Ar shield induced material ejection \npredominantly by bulk radial liquid ejection. \nPorosity and microcracking are attendant problems when laser treating the surface of many materials, with \ncement and concrete being no exception. It is known, however, that certain shield gasses can go some way \nto assuage or even eliminate the serious problems of surface porosity and microcracking. This work aims to \nelucidate the effects of using Ar, O2 and He shield gasses during the treatment of the OPC surface of \nconcrete with a HPDL. The findings showed a marked difference existed in the surface condition of the \nconcrete after HPDL treatment depending on the shield gas used. \n2. Experimental procedures \nThe concrete studied in the experiments was the ubiquitous OPC based concrete. For the purpose of \nexperimental convenience the as-received concrete blocks were sectioned into cubes (120 x 120 x 20 mm\n3\n) \nprior to laser treatment. In order to obtain results of a practical and useful nature, the area of the concrete \nirradiated during the experiments was the naturally occurring \u2018as cast\u2019 OPC surface of concrete. In this case \nthe OPC surface of the concrete had a thickness of 2.5 mm. The composition by volume of the OPC is as \nfollows: CaO (63.9%), SiO2 (21.9%), Al2O3 (5.7%), Fe2O3 (2.8%), SO3 (2.7%), MgO (2.2%), K2O (0.7%) \nand Na2O (0.1%). \nThe laser used in this work was a HPDL (Diomed Ltd.) emitting at 810\u00b120 nm with a maximum output \npower of 120 W. The HPDL beam was delivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core \ndiameter optical fibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly. The laser was \noperated in the continuous wave (CW) mode and produced a multi-mode beam. The defocused laser beam \nwas fired across the OPC surface of the concrete samples by traversing the samples beneath the beam using \nthe x- and y-axis of a CNC gantry table at speeds ranging from 60-600 mm min\n-1\n. So as to study the effects \nof different shield gasses, coaxially blown gas jets of O2, Ar and He were applied at a rate of 5 l min\n-1\n.  \n3. Results \nThe constituents of OPC are minerals which exist as multi-component solid solution chemical compounds. \nOf particular importance with regards this study, OPC contains in relatively large proportions SiO2, Al2O3 \nand Fe2O3, which are basic glass network formers and modifiers. Consequently the intense local heating \nbrought about by the incident HPDL beam results in melting of these compounds at around 1283\n0\nC, thereby \ncausing the materials to lose the retained water and form an amorphous glassy material consisting of \nvarious calcium-silicate-alumina compounds. Indeed, the amorphous nature of this glaze has been verified \nand fully characterised by Lawrence and Li [8-10]. \nVariations in the shield gas used during the HPDL irradiation of the OPC surface of concrete were seen to \nhave a significantly effect on the surface morphology of the HPDL induced glaze. Fig. 1 shows a typical \noptical surface view of the HPDL treated OPC surface of concrete with (a) O2, (b) Ar and (c) He shield \ngases.  \n  3 \n         \nFig. 1.

Best-fit cooling rate curves for the laser glazed OPC surface of concrete when O2, Ar and He shield gases \nwere employed. \nAs is evident from Fig. 1, the use of O2 as the shield gas results in surface glazes that exhibit far fewer \nmicrocracks and porosities than those generated with either Ar of He shield gases. Indeed, as one can see \nfrom Fig 1(a), the glaze generated on the OPC surface of concrete when using an O2 shield gas appears to \nhave very few microcracks and almost no porosities. In contrast, the glaze generated on the OPC surface of \nconcrete when He was employed as the shield gas can be seen to posses a great many microcracks and \nnumerous porosities (Fig. 1(c)). The glaze produced on the OPC surface of concrete when using and Ar \nshield gas appears similar (Fig. 1(b)), although the number of microcracks present seems to be somewhat \nless than when a He shield gas was used.  \nThe findings of an investigation to study the temperatures on the surface of the OPC resulting from HPDL \ninteraction with the selected shield gases are shown graphically in Fig. 2. As can be seen clearly from Fig. \n2, the recorded cooling rate of the OPC surface under a He shield gas after the HPDL beam has been \nremoved was slightly faster than that when Ar was used as the shield gas. Moreover, Fig. 2 shows that a \n0.5 mm 0.5 mm 0.5 mm \n  4 \ncooling rate considerably slower than those occasioned by the use of either Ar or He as the shield gas \nresulted from employing an O2 shield gas. \n4. Discussion and conclusions \nBecause of its open structure, it is possible for gases to dissolve molecularly in glass and, if the gas \nmolecule is small enough, it can diffuse rapidly in a simple glass such as fused silica [11]. Indeed, gases \nsuch as H2 and O2 are known to dissolve molecularly in glass and can also react with the glass network \n[11]. The quality of the glazes produced, in terms of porosity and microcracks, was greatly influenced by \nthe type of shield gas employed. When using any of the shield gases the surfaces appeared undulated and \ndisplayed porosities to varying degrees. Moreover, the crack density in the He and Ar shield gas samples \nwere found to be higher than that of the sample treated with an O2 shield gas.  \nThe use of O2 as the shield gas significantly reduced the number of microcracks and porosities within the \nOPC glaze. This implies that the O2 interacted with the glass network increasing the heat generation and \nsubsequently the fluidity of the melt. In contrast, the He and Ar did not interact with the glass network and \nwas consequently trapped within the more viscous melt in the form of bubbles. As such, when employing \nO2, inherent gas bubbles generated during vitrification of the OPC escaped from the melt more readily due \nto its lower viscosity, thus reducing the number of porosities. In addition, as the cooling rate curves for the \nHPDL treated OPC surface of concrete shown in Fig. 2 indicate, when the laser beam had been removed the \ncooling of the OPC was faster when He and Ar shield gases were employed as opposed to an O2 shield gas. \nTherefore, the length of time that the OPC surface of concrete is of a sufficient fluidity to allow the \ngenerated gas bubbles to escape the surface easily is much reduced, resulting in porosities and microcracks. \nThe marked reduction in the number of microcracks generated when using an O2 shield gas instead of He or \nAr can also be ascribed to the apparent much reduced cooling rate occasioned by the use of O2 as the shield \ngas. This is borne out somewhat when one considers that He is known to effect a higher rate of cooling than \nboth O2 and particularly Ar [8]. Clearly, the tendency of the HPDL induced glaze on the OPC surface of \nconcrete will be reduced if the cooling rate of the molten OPC is reduced. This is principally because a high \ncooling rate inherently induces thermal stresses which in turn can lead to crack development in order to \nrelieve the generated thermal stresses.  \nReferences \n1.
