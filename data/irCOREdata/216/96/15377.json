The first half of the paper concentrates on the development of the contemporary NTE by \nacademics in the 1990s, showing how such ideas were translated to policy makers through their \nconcomitance with other policies such as urban entrepreneurialism and market liberalization which \nfitted into neoliberal policy trends. The second half of the paper discusses the subsequent academic \ncritique of NTE. Though this has focused on the regulatory practices of neoliberalism, showing how \nthese have lead to large concentration of bars which promote unhealthy drinking practices, there \nhas been a move in recent work to also consider the subjectivities which have developed in the \nneoliberal NTE. I suggest that an understanding of subjectivities informed by theoretical work of \nDeleuze and Guattari and non-representational theories, which see subjectivities as trans-personal \nassemblages which emerge through dispersed interactions between bodies and affects, can develop \nthese insights. This moves research into neoliberal subjectivities in the NTE towards a research \nagenda in which the processes of the emergence of subjectivities are investigated and which thus \nresponds to some of the recent critiques made of regulatory-focused approaches.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \nIntroduction: The Night-Time Economy of British Cities \nThe phrase \u2018Night-time economy\u2019 (NTE) has been used to refer to  a portion of night-time economic \nactivity, specifically,  the entertainment and retail provisions of cities at night, often confined even \nfurther to the \u2018booze economy\u2019. The term has been conceived on the one hand as taking the \nactivities in bars and clubs and using \u201cthe boosterist representation of these activities as a means to \nregenerate inner city areas\u201d (Talbot 2007:1) and on the other as being: \nthe festivals, the cultural initiatives aimed at bringing people back into the city, the office and \nresidential developments that either incorporated or pointed to the cultural facilities of the centre, \nthe promotion of the city as a culturally vibrant realm\u2026 the idea of the nightlife of the city, a realm of \nplay, of socialisation, of encounter and of evasion associated with the night-time (Lovatt and \nO'Connor 1995:130).  \nIt is no coincidence that the former, derisive comment postdates that latter optimistic vision by \nsome twelve years. Hadfield et al., in discussing the related idea of the 24-hour city (24HC), state \nthat whilst the concepts behind night-time led regeneration of the 1990s had wide ranging aims, \nthey have been \u201cassaulted\u201d and left \u201cdead in streets splattered with blood, vomit, urine, and the \nsodden remains of take-always\u201d by the \u2018Mass Volume Vertical Drinker\u2019 (Hadfield et al. 2001:300). \nThese comments reflect a perception that the agenda to create an NTE based upon a \u2018time-shift\u2019, \nmixing day and night activities across the daily schedule within mixed-use residential, commercial, \nbusiness and leisure spaces, has failed. Instead, a criminogenic (Hadfield 2006) \u201cduplication of the \nmost profitable use\u201d (Jacobs 1961:259) of city night spaces, in which weak local authorities have \nfollowed an easy route of squeezing the highest profits out of \u2018errant consumers\u2019, has emerged \n(Chatterton 2002; Hobbs et al. 2005).  \n \nThis paper reflects upon this change in attitude towards the NTE in literature on British cities. As \nsuch, it offers a long-term, two stage review. Firstly, it will review the role of research from urban \n3 \n \nstudies and cultural studies in the 1990s in contributing to the development of the NTE. This work \nhad its origins in critiques of 1980s regeneration in British cities, which was perceived as business \nand investment lead (Gaffikin and Warf 1993). Urbanist arguments took inspiration from the work of \nJane Jacobs (Jacobs 1961), and from a perceived \u2018Continental European\u2019 lifestyle, which would \ncontain a wider variety of leisure and shopping opportunities than were available in pub-dominated \nBritish towns and cities (Bianchini 1993). Arguments were made for the deregulation of licensing and \nplanning laws so that more mixed-use city centre developments could be created, in order to foster \na vibrant lifestyle including street-cafes, late night shopping, theatres and late-night public festivals \n(Comedia 1991; Heath 1997). Such arguments had willing recipients in politicians hoping to appear \nmore progressive in local governments, who saw an active NTE as a way of increasing revenue \nthrough increased business hours and premises occupation, and by the national New Labour \ngovernment, whose urban policies were based around the concept of an urban renaissance (Holden \nand Iveson 2003) and who pushed for the deregulation of the night-time economy (Hadfield 2006).  \n \nSecondly, this paper will discuss the subsequent critical stance on the NTE taken by work from \ncriminologists, geographers and sociologists. There have been concerns over the violence (Thomas \nand Bromley 2000; Winlow et al. 2001; Bromley and Nelson 2002; Blobaum and Hunecke 2005; \nCaiazza 2005; Roberts and Turner 2005; Roberts 2006; Hobbs et al. 2007; Recasens 2007) and health \n(Sengupta and Hoyle 2005; Jayne et al. 2006; Eldridge and Roberts 2008; Griffin, Bengry-Howell et al. \n2009) impacts of nightlife , the inequalities in governance (Chatterton 2002; Talbot 2004; Hobbs et \nal. 2005; Talbot 2007; Winlow and Hall 2009), the damage to town centres (Hadfield et al. 2001; \nAdams et al. 2007) and the centring of power in large chain pub companies (Chatterton and Hollands \n2001; Chatterton 2002; Chatterton and Hollands 2002). Within this work, the blame for such \nproblems is attributed to the neoliberal enactment of the NTE which occurred due to its positioning \nwithin a specific neoliberal policy environment.  \n4 \n \n \nAs a result of these critiques, the NTE and its associated concepts have become somewhat \ndiscredited.  However, this paper argues that it is not the concepts in themselves which should be \nrejected. It is difficult to disagree with the arguments that sought to generate a balanced human-\ncentred NTE (Bianchini and Schwengel 1991:227) based on play, socialisation, encounter and evasion  \n(Lovatt and O'Connor 1995:130).  Rather, it is the \u2018real-existing\u2019 NTE, or what Hadfield et al. refer to \nas the \u2018situational outcomes\u2019 of the policies of the NTE (Hadfield et al. 2001), which are problematic \nThis  negative view is a result of a focus on the neoliberal regulatory changes which occurred to \nallow the contemporary NTE to develop (Chatterton and Hollands 2002). Recent work on the NTE, \nhowever, has begun to show a shift towards an interest in the cultural and phenomenological \naspects of the NTE, and in particular the subjectivities which emerge from this (Hobbs et al. 2005).  \nThis has be joined by calls for research into drinking which understands it as an everyday and \nmultiply enacted practice, rather than just as an issue of health or deviance (Latham 2003; Jayne et \nal 2006; Carr 2008; Eldridge and Roberts 2008). I will use ideas influenced by recent work in social \ntheory on affect, and particularly that influenced by Deleuze and Guattari, to suggest that that such \nresearch could create a more complex understanding of the multiple topographies of the NTE and \nthus begin to show: firstly, how certain neoliberal subjectivities come to dominate and where other \nsubjectivities might emerge; and secondly how an understanding of this could help return to  the \noriginal concepts of the NTE,  but without their neoliberal pitfalls. \n \nThis paper will begin with stage one of this review, then, exploring the literature of the 1990s with a \nfocus on the development of the concept of the 24HC and the ways in which it was sold to policy \nmakers. The 24HC and the NTE are closely linked concepts \u2013 one implies the other. I will show how \naspects of the literature which influenced the take up of the 24HC encouraged the development of a \nparticularly \u2018neoliberal\u2019 NTE. I will then move on to the critical literature on the NTE and show the \n5 \n \nsubjectivities that it identifies emerging out of the NTE. I will then use this understanding from the \nliterature on the NTE to suggest a research agenda based upon the techniques through which \nneoliberal subjectivities come about. It should be noted at this stage that the focus is almost \nexclusively on the British context, though similar debates have occurred in other countries. Jayne et \nal. provide a comprehensive overview of the issues relating to drinking culture in different countries \n(Jayne et al. 2006; Jayne et al. 2008), whilst a recent edited collection focuses on violence in night-\ntime leisure zones across Europe (Recasens 2007). \n \nAcademic Development of the NTE and the Twenty-Four Hour City \nThe following section then is a discussion of the development the concept of the twenty four hour \ncity and in particular the role of academic literature in influencing its translation to public policy. The \n24HC is a term which has undergone a certain level of discrediting in recent years (Hadfield et al., \n2001): it has been associated with increased violence and damage to city centres as bars, staying \nopen than later before, sell higher volumes of alcohol at low prices (Roberts 2006). Yet, the 24HC \nretains a certain level of presence and discursive power in policy literature. It is worth, therefore, \nlooking at the conditions under which such a concept was brought to policy.   \n \nThough the idea can be traced back to Jane Jacobs\u2019 seminal urbanist work \u2018The Death and Life of \nGreat American Cities\u2019, as well as the analyses of Murray Melbin (Jacobs 1961; Melbin 1987), the \nnotion of the 24HC which influenced British urban policy in the early 1990s comes from the work of \na group of urban academics centred around the think-tank Comedia. In 1991, this group produced a \ndocument aimed at policy makers called Out of Hours: A study of economic, social and cultural life in \ntwelve town centres in the UK (Comedia 1991). This publication was the result of twelve months of \nresearch in fifteen town centres in Britain and called for a \u2018time-shift\u2019 in socio-cultural policy \n6 \n \n(ibid:22). In this report, Comedia actually call for an \u2018eighteen-hour city\u2019 in which the activities of the \ndaytime are spread out into the evening, whilst leisure facilities are used both during the day \u2013 by \ngroups such as the elderly \u2013 and long into the night (ibid). A Comedia-organised conference in \nManchester in 1993, combined with the Out of Hours trial in Manchester of extended pub and club \nopening hours and late evening shopping, popularised the idea (Bianchini 1995; Lovatt and O'Connor \n1995). Though it has been claimed retrospectively that the conference was intended to be critical of \nthe 24HC (Roberts and Turner 2005), this criticism is of local management and regulation preventing \nthe development of a 24HC (Comedia 1991), as can be seen in the output of the conference: \u201cAs a \nfew towns and cities have realised, a lively evening economy is an important way of developing a \nunique sense of place (Montgomery 1993:20).\u201d Similarly, Comedia are critical of the 24HC in the \nsense that they see the failure to develop this as a failing of poor local management and regulation \n(Comedia 1991).  \n \nRelated to these ideas was a call for the cultivation of a \u2018European\u2019 lifestyle (Heath 1997), referring \nto an atmosphere which is conducive to a certain series of subjectivities, namely those of the loosely \ndefined \u2018European\u2019 caf\u00e9 drinker, for whom specific urban affects, especially \u2018vitality\u2019 and \u2018vibrancy\u2019 \nare important (Lovatt and O'Connor 1995; Jones et al. 1999). The aim of this work was to provoke: \na more holistic and expansive consideration of the totality of city centres. This includes their social \nand cultural dimensions, and it also has an aspirational dimension aiming to stimulate ideas and \nentrepreneurial activity (Heath 1997). \nAs this quote indicates, the concept of the 24HC was aligned with other contemporarily popular \nconcepts and policies, such as urban entrepreneurialism and inter-urban competitiveness (Jessop \n1998).  Alongside the dissatisfaction with the urban regeneration of the 1980s, this opened up a \n\u2018policy window\u2019 into which the 24HC was able to place itself (Kingdon 1995). \n7 \n \n \n Yet to understand the success of this literature in translating to policy solely as a matter of temporal \ncoincidence with other aligned policies and discourses is to miss the structural links between these \nideas. The coincidence of these policies can be seen as a stage in the transition between two stages \nof neoliberal policy labelled by Peck and Tickell, namely \u2018roll-back\u2019 neoliberalism and \u2018roll-out\u2019 \nneoliberalism (Peck and Tickell 2002). \u2018Roll-back\u2019 neoliberalism is the name for the series of policies \nwhich erode the welfare or social support systems associated with previous regimes: this is an \nindividualising and fragmentizing process and a period of self-proclaimed \u2018deregulation\u2019, though as \nWacquant notes, such practices of deregulation or less-state are often in actuality practices of re-\nshaping and re-aligning state control away from welfare and towards punitative measures \n(Wacquant 2008:58). Alienation, lack of access to jobs and social deprivation emerge as problems \nfrom these roll-back policies. These problems are tackled with \u2018roll-out\u2019 neoliberalism, which \nincreases the responsibilities of individuals and encourages entrepreneurial style behaviour (Peck \nand Tickell 2002). To take such a framework is not to deny that \u201cwhat we have come to recognise as \n\u2018\u2018hegemonic neoliberalism\u2019\u2019 is a muddled set of ad hoc, opportunistic accommodations to these \nunstable dynamics of social change\u201d (Barnett 2005:10), but helps explain the co-existence of these \nvarious concepts and ideas and their ability to cross over into policy. \n \nThis is explicated in the work of those such as Bianchini or Kreitzman, who sold the 24HC as part of \nthe NTE to policy makers in the terms of \u2018marketization\u2019 (Castree 2007). For Bianchini: \nthere are also economic opportunities [to developing an NTE]. For instance, in the case of important \nregional cities the night-time could be used to maximise access to urban facilities from a wide \ncatchment area. People from that area, many of whom are working in the daytime, may need longer \nopening hours in order to access facilities. More generally, there is the opportunity of 'doubling' the \n8 \n \ncity's economy, starting perhaps from entertainment but then widening into other areas (Bianchini \n1995:125). \nThis selling of the NTE promises increased revenue through the entrepreneurial exploitation of new \ntime-spaces. Discussing the 24HC more directly, Kreitzman enthused about the qualities of the 24 \nhour developments at Middlebrook, Bolton in the north-west of England, including a cinema, a \nvariety of shops and restaurants and even a football ground (Kreitzman 1999). Indeed Kreitzman is \neager for a time when \u201cthe ritual of the 3p.m. Saturday kick-off and its connotations of cloth-capped \nworking men thronging the terraces is finally substituted by a Saturday evening kick-off\u201d (ibid:9).  \nQuotes such as this play heavily upon class identities and a desire to control working class activities \nand associated spaces (Skeggs 2004): so Lovatt desires the development of \u201cshops, gyms, cinemas, \nmusic venues, art galleries, theatres and bowling alleys\u201d rather than \u201cpublic houses, bars, bingo \nhalls, restaurants and discos\u201d (Lovatt 1993:10) . This \u2018civilization\u2019 of the city centre is about \nincreasing middle class presence, (Helms et al. 2007) thus creating new consumption and markets \nout of low consumption working class time-spaces. \n \nSo the academic literature on the 24HC and the NTE in the 1990s was influential in creating the \nconcepts which influenced urban policy development through that decade and beyond. Yet their \ninfluence was limited to the extent that such policies were interpreted to fit in with other \ncontemporary discourses that resulted in \u2018roll-out\u2019 neoliberal policies. Before moving on to discuss \nthe more recent critical studies of the NTE, it is worth first considering the explanations of the \ncontemporary perceived failure of the NTE provided by those academics who  played a role in its \ngeneration.  In their article on the state of the 24HC in London, Roberts and Turner interview some \nof the academics central to the 24HC project. As Roberts and Turner report, all now hold negative \nviews on the 24HC (Roberts and Turner 2005).  Montgomery and Worpole blame liberalisation of \nplanning laws, but also continue to suggest that it was a failure of the working class to follow more \n9 \n \n\u2018sophisticated\u2019 ways of living: \u201cI certainly had visions of elegant cafe\u00b4 society, of British people \nstrolling about civilized streets as the Italians do... this proved not to be the case\u201d (Montgommery, \nquoted in Roberts and Turner 2005:190). This lingering view indicates the importance not just of \nregulatory change, but of evolving subjectivities, which this paper will explore in the following \nsection. \n \nCritiques of the Neoliberal Night-Time Economy: From Regulation to Subjectivities \nSince roughly 2000, there has been a change in academic output on the NTE, reflecting too changes \nin public understandings of the city at night. Such critiques have emerged due to the numerous \nperceived problems that contemporary cities have at night, as discussed previously. The focus of \ncritique has been on regulatory neoliberalism, but there is also a developing critique of the \nsubjectivities encouraged by a neoliberal NTE. I will show how this can be turned into a research \nagenda to further our current understanding of the NTE in British cities. One of the most sustained \nseries of engagements with the NTE has come from a group of criminologists collaborating on a \nvariety of research projects (Hobbs et al. 2000; Hadfield et al. 2001; Winlow et al. 2001; Hobbs et al. \n2003; Hobbs et al. 2005; Hadfield 2006; Hadfield 2007; Hayward and Hobbs 2007; Hobbs et al. 2007; \nHadfield 2008; Winlow and Hall 2009). These have largely concerned violence in the NTE, but have \nalso focused on regulatory changes, as well as a specific focus on the roles of bouncers. They also \nshare many concerns with the urban geographers such as Roberts, Eldridge and Talbot (Talbot 2004; \nRoberts and Turner 2005; Roberts 2006; Roberts et al. 2006; Talbot 2007; Eldridge and Roberts \n2008). Firstly, then, these scholars have been concerned by the rising levels of violence in the NTE. \nViolence is seen as a result of: \nthe gathering together in one place of individuals and groups who embody antagonisms that may be \nrooted in ethnic, racial, class or territorial motives, quite apart from random or alcohol inspired \naggression (Hobbs et al. 2000:706). \n10 \n \nThe high levels of violence can be exclusionary (Roberts 2006), though recent research suggests that \nmost users of the night-time city can avoid the most dangerous areas and that it is infrastructural \nrestrictions, such as a lack of public transport, that prevent people from using the city at night, \nrather than violence levels (Eldridge and Roberts 2008).  \n \nSecondly, these critiques have had a regulatory focus. Hadfield, in particular, charts the \ndevelopment of liberalised licensing under the post-1997 Labour Party government (Hadfield 2006). \nLocal governments of the 1990s were unable to resist the high levels of capital investment involved \nin the sale of disused public buildings to chain pub companies known as \u2018pubcos\u2019 (ibid:45). This led \nto a proliferation of \u2018vertical drinking establishments\u2019, which attempted to include as many \ncustomers as possible in a small space, selling large quantities of alcohol at low prices. Evolving \nregulatory laws meant that local government then lost its power to control these areas, just as the \nproblems associated with this proliferation became apparent. With this power removed, state \nregulation instead began to target the consumers of the nightlife instead of these producers. As \nHobbs et al. put it:  \nat the same time as appearing to regulate, the state encourages the rampant growth of night-time \nconsumption, which is bound to lead to an increase in crime and disorder and allows supposedly \naccountable local agencies of governance to remain easy prey to voracious market forces (Hobbs et \nal. 2005:173).  \nThis contradictory trend has also been studied by the urban geographers Chatterton and Hollands, \nas well as others coming from critical economic geography positions. Their focus has been on the \nchanging ownership of nightlife, in which local producers have been squeezed out by chain bars and \nthe pubcos described above. They see this as a destruction of diversity, in which consumers \u201care \nexposed to little choice and rather than engaging in alternative or independent cultural styles \n11 \n \ninstead seek escapism in the less risky world of corporate packaged nightlife\u201d (Chatterton and \nHollands 2001:133).  \n \nThese various critiques can be read and understood as critiques of neoliberalism as a system of \nregulation and organisation which promotes market and corporate power whilst removing the \npossibility of locally-based interventions. Many of the diagnoses of the problems of the NTE thus \nconcern regulatory changes: Hadfield et al., for example, call for \u201ca much more integrated and \ninterventionist approach to municipal regulation\u201d (Hadfield et al. 2001:302).  These approaches, \nhowever, have not gone uncontested. Jayne et al. identify such portrayals of urban nightlife as \noverly neat (Jayne et al. 2008), whilst Eldridge and Roberts warn about creating a binary between \n\u2018binge drinkers\u2019 and more \u2018civilised\u2019 users, noting that in research participants often had complex \nviews of the NTE precisely because they will often move between these two categories of \nresponsible and irresponsible consumers (Eldridge and Roberts 2008). Measham reminds us of the \nimportance of considering the relationship between regulation and the social-cultural context of \ndrinking, in which \u2018determined drinkers\u2019 may be otherwise good consumers (Measham 2006). This \nmoves us towards the concept of the subjectivities of neoliberalism in the urban night, which many \nof these texts have dealt with, often indirectly. Neoliberalism has involved the \u201cindividualization of \nsocial risk, the dismantling of social rights and the subjection of people to self-regulation\u201d \n(Ronneberger 2008:139), resulting in subjectivities that can be conceived as: \na shifting ensemble of states that are received and passed on, states over which that person rarely \nhas much in the way of direct control but which can be modulated in the passing in such a way as to \nproduce nuances or even, at the limit, quite new forms of going on (Thrift 2008:85). \nIn these two descriptions, alteration of subjectivities takes a central place in neoliberalism, shifting \nsubtly from the disciplinary societies described by Foucault in which individuals\u2019 socialites are \ndefined via shifts between multiple \u2018closed\u2019 institutions such as schools, factories and hospitals \n12 \n \n(Foucault 1979) and towards \u2018societies of control\u2019 which involve a dispersed power based upon \nmultiple modifications to subjectivities (Deleuze 1992; Thrift 2008). \n \nThrough the literature on the NTE, then, we are confronted by a series of different subjectivities and \nthe modes in which they are manipulated. Hayward and Hobbs set out a distinction between those \nsubjectivities which are promised by nightlife and those which are delivered. For them: \nthe place myth of the carnival is central to the continued allure of the high street on a Friday and \nSaturday night...; the cumulative behaviour of the young drunk population of Britain\u2019s \u2018night-time \nhigh-streets\u2019 (Hadfield 2006) constitute, \u2018not inversions of the social order but mirrors of it\u2019 \n(Schechner 1993: 48) (Hayward and Hobbs 2007:443-444). \nHere then, the subjectivity of the hedonistic free individual is mythical, instead brought to order by \nthe \u2018real\u2019 subjectivity of compliant consumerism. Such consumerist subjectivities act, in Deleuzo-\nGuattrian terms as \u2018microfascisms\u2019, coming to dominate a certain place or individual through an \never-increasing accumulation of increasingly \u2018stratified\u2019 practices (Saldanha 2006:174). A subjectivity \nis not thought to be inherently microfascist, but can act so if it comes to endanger the existence of \nothers subjectivities within a certain space. For Hayward and Hobbs, this is \u201ccontrolled suspension of \nconstraints\u201d (446), that is, a relaxing of expected norms of behaviour but within limited boundaries. \nMany participants within the NTE, for example, will aim to achieve a strategic level of \u2018safe\u2019 \ndrunkenness (Demant 2009). By permitting some escapism, consumerist subjectivities appear to \nfulfil the desire associated with being-different without, according to Hayward and Hobbs, allowing \nany significant differing to occur. Whilst Hayward and Hobbs pave the way for such an argument, \nthey maintain the reality of these subjectivities as a dialectic between the real \u2018consumerism\u2019 and \nthe mythical \u2018liminality\u2019.  Understanding the relationship between these to be one of conflicting \nsubjectivities, with consumerism taking a microfascist role, we can begin instead to see this a more \nfluid relationship in which the desire for difference or for hedonism is often, but not always, \n13 \n \ndominated by consumerist practices. This moves too beyond the alteration between subjectivities \nthat Eldridge and Roberts discuss. Whilst consumerist practices dominate, it is precisely because of \ntheir fulfilling the desire for alternative subjectivities.  \n \nThis argument can be further advanced by considering the mechanisms through which subjectivities \nare controlled and managed within the NTE, that is, the ways in which control operates. Hadfield\u2019s \nBar Wars includes a deep description emerging from ethnographic and interview data of the \npractices involved in various actant\u2019s attempts to maintain order in the NTE. Such control is \nmultifaceted, ranging from the architectural design of bar spaces through the formalised control of \nbouncers through to the subtle manipulation of lighting and sound levels by disc jockeys (DJs) \n(Hadfield 2006). These practices are inherently spatial and operate as much through management of \nwhat Hadfield identifies as \u2018mood\u2019 as through direct regulatory control (ibid). This control of mood \ninvolves the modulation of affects, bodies and spaces so that different components of \nsubjectification are fore grounded (Guattari 2000); Hadfield\u2019s mood can be conceived as the \ncumulative effect of the \u2018maelstrom of affects\u2019 of which Thrift speaks (Thrift 2004). The example of \nDJs is perhaps the most interesting. Hadfield conceives of DJs as having a key role in the \nmanagement of affect within a club. They are caught between the tension that \u201cpoor entertainment \ncan induce boredom and resentment among customers and stimulate heavier drinking.... [whilst] \nconversely, heightened states of arousal may also contribute to aggression\u201d (Hadfield 2006: 98). DJs \nsimultaneously have to induce affects of excitement, joy and exhilaration through their manipulation \nof light, music and other sounds, whilst employing the same tools to keep these affects at a \nmanageable level. The complexity of this process \u2013 sometimes, as Hadfield points out, self-reflexive, \nbut often tacit and \u2018non-conscious\u2019 (Massumi 2002:36) \u2013 indicates the various possibilities for \ndifference which may emerge:, power cuts, the ordering of certain songs, the mixture of different \nlights and sounds, or the overall atmosphere of a city on a given night may all generate events \u2013 that \n14 \n \nis, moments of difference, of change, or of memorability (Thrift 2008). This is further complicated by \nthe interaction with subjectivities and bodies that are altered through the consumption of alcohol, \nor drugs more broadly (Leyshon 2008). There are sites and practices which take on a more overtly \nimportant or \u2018political\u2019 role than that of the DJ, but the very point is that subjectivities emerge out of \nthe spatially distributed events and practices that take place through the night, from the apparently \nmomentous to the apparently mundane.  \n \nUnderstanding the manipulation of affects in the NTE and understanding the negative subjectivities \nthat they produce as \u2018microfascisms\u2019 helps break down the binary trends in the academic literature \nthat Jayne et al. and Eldridge and Roberts both detect. Whilst the literature over the last decade has \ncomprehensively shown how regulatory changes \u2013 namely the reduction of local government \nregulatory power, the liberalisation of licensing and planning laws and increased focus on punitative \nmeasures for irresponsible customers \u2013 have helped contribute towards a variety of identified \nproblems within the NTE, and despite a turn towards more cultural understandings of the NTE in \nrecent years, its regulatory focus has resulted in an overly smooth, simplified tale of the NTE \nemerging. By bringing some of the poststructuralist-influenced work on subjectivities to this \nproblem, we can see that this move beyond the identification of regulatory neoliberalism as the \ncause of the \u2018criminogenic NTE\u2019 towards understandings of the processes through which this NTE \noperates can reveal the complex topographies of which the NTE is composed. \n \n \nConclusion \nIn performing a \u2018two-stage\u2019 review of the literature on the NTE, this paper has attempted to track \nthe changing role of academic work in this area from cheerleader to dissenting voice. The review \n15 \n \nshows how the initial academic ideals (Comedia 1991) also contained the ingredients which \nappealed to a neoliberal policy environment. The comments by those academics in later papers \n(Roberts and Turner 2005) indicate that they presumed that certain changes in subjectivities \u2013 \nlargely based around class \u2013 would occur in relation to certain regulatory changes. That certain \nneoliberal subjectivities have been encouraged by the NTE is not at stake, but the changes were \ndifferent to those than Comedia and others wanted.  Critiques built up around the regulatory \nframework which generated these subjectivities (Hadfield et al. 2001; Chatterton and Hollands \n2002), yet this work produced a largely \u2018flat\u2019 understanding of the NTE in which the complex \ninterplay of subjectivities was not present (Eldridge and Roberts 2008; Jayne et al. 2008). Though \nwork in recent years has shown a shift away from the regulation-dominated understandings of the \nNTE (Hadfield 2006; Hayward and Hobbs 2007; Hadfield 2008), this project still requires \ndevelopment. In particular, the ideas of non-representational theories and a focus on the ongoing \ndynamism of subjectivities can help move towards more complex topographical understandings of \nthe ways in which a neoliberal NTE comes to be, and the ways in which certain subjectivities come to \ndominate as \u2018microfascisms\u2019 \nThere are, of course, further issues to consider. This review has largely overlooked the role of both \ndrinking practices and drug consumption more generally: though plenty of research into changing \ndrinking habits has occurred (Jayne et. al. 2006), there is limited research which considers the \nrelationship between embodiment and subjectivities when bodies are in altered states (Leyshon, \n2008). Jackson suggests that such altering can make permanent radical changes to subjectivities \n(Jackson 2004:155), though it is more likely that experiences of drinking are merged into already \ncomplex topographies of the self (Leyshon 2008:283), as drinkers move between different \nsubjectivities according to patterns of consumption (Eldridge and Roberts 2008).  Calls for research \ninto subjectivities also raise methodological questions, notably as to how subjectivities might be \nenvisioned and \u2018operationalised\u2019. A lengthy discussion exceeds the scope of this review, though in \norder to get to subjectivities we might focus on:  gestures (Herzfeld 2009); processes of translation \n16 \n \nbetween subjectivity and specific assemblages of sites or activities (Latour and Hermant 1998; \nDemant 2009); rhythms, spatial processes and diagramming of bodies (Latham 2003; McCormack \n2003; 2008) amongst other themes. Such approaches could only ever be partial, but may help \ndevelop an understanding of the multiple ways in which subjectivities come into being and in doing \nso can help us rework the concepts which informed the creation of the NTE  in ways which respond \nto the critiques discussed in this paper.   \nBibliography \n \nAdams, M., Moore, G., Cox, T., Croxford, B., Refaee, M., Sharples, S.
