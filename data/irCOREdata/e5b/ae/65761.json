Owing to \nits wide-ranging objectives and potentially universal reach, the ICC\u2019s creation is \nregarded as the greatest development in international law over the past decade.1 The \nEuropean Union (EU) has been at the forefront of the efforts for the Court\u2019s \nestablishment, development and operation. Beyond the grand rhetoric surrounding the \nEU-ICC relations, the EU has undoubtedly committed substantial diplomatic capital \nand resources to the ICC cause. Parallel to the developments at the ICC, the Union \nfinds itself at an important crossroad in its constitutional development.2 Over the \nyears, its constitutional transformation has, to a large degree, enabled it to assume its \nresponsibility as an active player in a rapidly changing world and in the face of ever-\ngreater challenges.3  \n With regard to the ICC, however, the EU\u2019s protagonistic role is inherently \ncontroversial because of its constitutional features. The political capital invested in the \nsuccess of the ICC may run the risk of being wasted as a result of the inability of the \nUnion to support the good intentions with tangible policies and measures. This is \n                                                 \n \n* Lecturer in Law and Deputy Director of the Durham European Law Institute, Durham University. \nRobert Sch\u00fctze\u2019s comments on an earlier draft are gratefully acknowledged. \n** Lecturer in Law, School of Law, University of Nottingham. \n1 For an overview of the International Criminal Court (ICC), see William A Schabas, An Introduction to \nthe International Criminal Court, 2nd edition, (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004). \n2 See, Brussels European Council 21\/22 June 2007, Presidency Conclusions, Doc. 11177\/07 CONCL2, \nembarking on yet another Treaty reform. \n3 Presidency Conclusions at paragraph 2.

In recent years, common \nrules have been promulgated by the EU in the field of Police and Judicial Cooperation \nleading to the emergence of an EU criminal law body,4 which is becoming \nincreasingly significant in relation to ICC matters.  \n The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the EU-ICC partnership. \nTo do so, this article aims to examine the EU initiatives in relation to the ICC and \nanalyse them against the backdrop of the EU\u2019s constitutional peculiarities. The \nanalysis includes the measures the EU has taken to commit to the ICC cause and \nimplement the Rome Statute and their impact on EU policy-making. More \nspecifically, this article will analyse the EU-ICC Cooperation Agreement and the EU \nThird Pillar measures affecting Member States cooperation with the ICC and \ngoverning the investigation and prosecution of crimes within the jurisdiction of the \nICC. A brief comment on the judicial review of Third Pillar measures in the European \nUnion will follow. Further, focus will shift to the examination of EU initiatives, \nprimarily in its relations with third countries, to preserve the universality and integrity \nof the Rome Statute. Finally, this article will identify some challenges this awkward \nsymbiosis between the Union and the ICC is likely to face.  \n \nThe European Union and the ICC \n \n The Statute for the ICC was adopted on 17 July 1998 at the end of The Rome \nConference which was, in many respects unique.5 Spread over six weeks, never \nbefore had so many States and NGOs taken part in a multilateral conference on \ninternational law.6 Following the successful outcome of the negotiations,7 the Court \nbecame operational on 1 July 2002 and, to date, numbers 105 State parties to it.8 \nEarlier this year, the Court\u2019s first trial, that of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, began in the \nHague and the charges against him were confirmed on 29 January 2007.9 As a global \ninstitution, which, however, operates outside the UN system, the ICC benefits from \nthe support of States and other international institutions. In order to sustain its \npotentially universal ambit in the fight against impunity, the Court relies heavily on \nthe above not only to promote its cause, but also to perform its daily functions. \n                                                 \n \n4 Ibid. at Chapter 8. \n5 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute) (17 July 1998) 2187 United Nations \nTreaty Series 3; 37 International Legal Materials 999. \n6 Philippe Kirsch and John T.

However, the EU developed as one of the staunchest supporters of the \nICC,11 not only in terms of its overall policy, but also in terms of generous financial \nsupport provided to the Court.12 The EU advocated the importance of putting an end \nto the impunity of perpetrators of the most heinous international crimes since the first \nsteps towards the establishment of the Court.13 Since the entry into force of the Rome \nStatute, the EU has taken a series of measures to continue its support and reinforce the \nICC. The importance the EU has given to the Court can be explained both with \nreference to the EU\u2019s own values and objectives, but also its strategic priorities. \n Anyone with a vague understanding of the European integration process will \nidentify the reasons behind the EU\u2019s interest in the ICC which goes beyond the easily \nidentifiable events that led to the establishment of the European Communities in the \n1950s.14 Yet, nowhere in the Treaty on European Union (TEU) is inscribed a value \nand objective broad enough to fully and explicitly encapsulate the objectives laid \ndown in the Rome Statute. This has been usually accommodated in \u201cthe consolidation \nof the rule of law and respect for human rights\u201d eulogies of the TEU.15 It has been \nassumed all along that \u201cthe principles of the Rome Statute \u2026 are fully in line with the \nprinciples and objectives of the Union\u201d.16 Regarding the strategic priorities of the \nUnion, apart from the general objective enshrined in the TEU that the Union asserts \nits identity on the international scene,17 the promotion of the ICC is identified as a \npriority in the EU\u2019s commitment to the establishment of an international order based \non effective multilateralism.18  \n \nThe European Union as the ICC\u2019s partner \n \n                                                 \n \n10 Article 87(6) Rome Statute. \n11 Cedric Ryngaert, \u201cUniversal Jurisdiction in an ICC Era: A Role to Play for EU Member States with \nthe Support of the European Union\u201d (2006) 14 European Journal of Crime, Criminal Law and \nCriminal Justice 46. \n12 The EU, through a dedicated budget line created by the European Parliament has provided over EUR \n20 million under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) for projects \nsupporting the ICC and international criminal justice.

The substantive input of the EU in \nthe drafting of the Rome Statute must be presumed. In fact, most of the issues raised by the Spanish \nPresidency in its Statement have been addressed in an EU-desirable manner in the final text. \n14 This is not limited to the coincidence that the foundational Treaties of both the European Economic \nCommunity and the ICC were signed in Rome. \n15 Article 11 TEU.

L115\/50, 28.4.2006, Recital 5.  \n3 \n \n \n \n In developing a partnership with the ICC, the EU has taken a number of \ninitiatives which will be examined in detail below. To understand where these fit with \nthe EU legal order, a succinct introduction to the EU edifice is needed. A lot of ink \nhas been spilled in law and political science literature to analyse the EU constitutional \nidiosyncrasy.19 For our purposes, it is important to highlight that the EU is not a \nunitary international actor but, by contrast, it consists of a complex mesh of Treaties \nwhich establish different methods and rules depending on whether the EU is acting in \nthe field of agriculture, monitoring missions abroad or measures taken to combat \norganised crime.20 This peculiar constitutional structure has been graphically \nrepresented in the form of three pillars of an ancient Greek temple, the First Pillar \nincorporating EU action in fields of European Community competence, the Second \nPillar covering the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Third Pillar \nthe Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal matters.21 The remainder of \ncompetences remain with the Member States.  \n How is the EU supposed to operate on the international plane when there are \noverlaps between Community (First Pillar), Union (Second and Third Pillars) and \nMember States\u2019 competences? Traditional EU external relations theory and practice \nhas dealt with the problem by having recourse to the principle of mixity, a term \ninvented to describe the European Community and Member State joint participation in \nthe negotiation, conclusion and implementation of international agreements.22 Since \nthe entry into force of the TEU and the subsequent practice of concluding agreements \nunder the Second and Third Pillars, the problem has been exacerbated. All hope has \nbeen trusted in constitutional reform which would abolish the Pillar structure and \nprovide for a more workable pattern of international action.23 At present however, the \nEU constitutional construction necessitates measures taken under different Treaty \nregimes as well as by the Member States for the fulfilment of the Rome Statute \nobligations. \n Having already portended the multidimensional character of EU policy \ntowards the ICC, it should be explained that the different Treaty objectives, \ninstruments and methods applicable in the different Pillars raise both theoretical and \npractical considerations. Moving from the domain of theoretical abstraction to the real \nproblems in policy-making and policy-implementing, the main foundation of the \n                                                 \n \n19 Inter alia, Joseph H.H.

Weiler, supra note 19 at pp. 130-187; Panos \nKoutrakos, EU International Relations Law, (Hart Publishing, Oxford and Portland, Oregon, 2006), \nChapter 4.  \n23 The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe provided a qualified solution to the problems by \nproposing the abolition of the Pillar structure. However, the Treaty failed ratification by all Member \nStates and has been consequently abandoned. A Reform Treaty based on the failed Constitution\u2019s \nblueprint has been proposed and negotiations are ongoing. Supra note 2. \n4 \n \n \n \nrelationship between the EU and the ICC is the Common Position on the International \nCriminal Court.24 At the same time, the main instrument implementing the \ncooperation obligation of the Rome Statute on behalf of the EU is the EU-ICC \nAgreement.25 Both instruments have been adopted under the CFSP. However, \nmeasures relating to the implementation of most other Rome Statute obligations to \nwhich the Union has committed itself by virtue of the Common Position have been \nadopted under the Third Pillar.26 Finally, as will be seen below, the promotion, of the \nprinciples of international criminal law in third countries has taken place pursuant to \nFirst Pillar instruments, through international agreements concluded by the \nCommunity.27 Clearly, however, most ICC-related obligations will have to be carried \nout by the Member States acting in their own competences.  \n This short introduction already demonstrates the Pillar-straddling activities of \nthe EU with regard to the ICC are destined to challenge the EU in particular regarding \nthe effective implementation of the ICC-sponsored obligations.  \nThe EU\u2019s commitment vis-\u00e0-vis the ICC \n \n In order to put its intentions into action, the EU needs and to take those \nmeasures necessary to implement the ICC obligations. At the outset, it should be \nrecalled that the EU is not a party to the Rome Statute and, as such, it is not bound by \nit in international law. From an EU perspective, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) \npromulgated the doctrine of functional succession which can be summarised in the \nproposition that the EU is bound by an international treaty to which it is not a party \nwhen the EU has taken over the responsibility from the Member States, i.e. having \nacquired exclusive competence, with regard to the agreement\u2019s functions.28 It goes \nwithout saying that for such functional succession to take place all Member States \nmust be parties to a given international agreement.29 This is not the case with the \nRome Statute.30 \n                                                 \n \n24 Council Common Position 2003\/444\/CFSP of 16 June 2003 on the International Criminal Court, O.J. \nL 150\/67, 18.6.2003.

See, Piet Eeckhout, External \nRelations of the European Union: Legal and Constitutional Foundations, (Oxford University Press, \n2004), at p. 439. This suggestion has been controversially followed in the recent judicial \npronouncements by the European Court of First Instance in Cases T-306\/01 Ahmed Ali Yusuf and Al \nBarakaat International Foundation v. Council and Commission [2005] ECR II-3533 and T-315\/01 \nYassin Abdullah Kadi v. Council and Commission [2005] ECR II-3649. \n5 \n \n \n \n The EU committed itself to the fight against impunity by virtue of a Common \nPosition31 which establishes the basic framework governing the EU-ICC relations. \nThe first Common Position on the International Criminal Court was adopted by the \nCouncil in 2001.32 In accordance with the theory of EU external relations, Common \nPositions establish the Union\u2019s policy statement on a certain theme.33 The timing of \nits adoption affected its focus which concentrated on the early entry into force of the \nRome Statute and the establishment of the ICC.34 To this end, the EU assumed the \nobligation to contribute by raising the issue in its relations with third parties and by \nassisting with implementation.35 The Common Position was amended in 200236 and \nreached its current form in 2003.37  \n The 2003 Common Position, which is largely based on the 2001 blueprint, \nendorses the principles and rules of international criminal law of the Rome Statute and \nidentifies the priorities and areas in which the European Union and the Member States \nmust act. In this respect, priority is given to the universal accession to the Rome \nStatute,38 the implementation of the Rome Statute by measures taken by the European \nUnion and the Member States,39 as well as the preservation of the integrity of the \nRome Statute.40  \n Measures to achieve the target of universal accession are further elaborated. \nThe European Union and the Member States undertake to raise the issue of \nratification, acceptance, approval and accession in negotiations with third States, \ngroups of States or relevant regional organisations.41 They also undertake to provide \ntechnical and financial assistance.42 The provision of political and technical support \nmay be part of country or region-specific strategies.43 In addition to the mention of the \nAction Plan in the preamble, little else is set out with regard to implementation. The \nCouncil of the European Union is simply given the task to coordinate the measures by \nthe European Union and the Member States but only in so far as implementation of \nArticles 2 and 3 of the Common Position.44 It should be pointed out that, in a way, \nimplementation by the EU and the Member States is not highlighted in the Common \nPosition; the emphasis is on providing assistance to third States. Regarding the \nintegrity of the Rome Statute, the Common Position draws attention to the EU \nGuiding Principles enshrined in the Council Conclusions of 30 September 2002.45 \nFinally, the Common Position establishes an obligation on the Member States to \ncooperate to ensure the smooth functioning of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP).46 \n                                                 \n \n31 Supra note 24 \n32 Supra note 16. \n33 Article 15 TEU.

However, the absence of any detail regarding measures to be taken at \nan EU level to implement the Rome Statute is striking. The extent to which the \nEuropean Union has fulfilled the general mandate provided by the Common Position \nwill be examined further below. \n   The Common Position provisions are supplemented and further elaborated \nupon in the Action Plan to follow-up on the Common Position on the International \nCriminal Court, adopted in 2002 and amended in 2004.47 The Action Plan is divided \ninto three sections: A. Coordination of EU activities, B. Universality and integrity of \nthe Rome Statute and C. Independence and effective functioning of the ICC.48 Section \nA maintains an institutional focus and establishes the steps which must be taken to \nbring the ICC squarely within the EU agenda and ensure better flow of information on \nICC-related matters among the EU institutions. The most important element \ninforming the effective co-ordination and consistency of information is the \nestablishment of an EU Focal Point and corresponding national Focal Points.49 \nSection B establishes the means to achieve the universality objective which include \npolitical dialogue, demarches or other bilateral means, statements in the UN and other \nmultilateral bodies and support for the dissemination of the ICC principles and rules.50 \nCountry or region-specific strategies will be developed to coordinate political and \ntechnical support.51 Concrete measures include, among others, the mainstreaming of \nthe ICC in EU external relations52 and the provision of financial and technical \nassistance to third countries53 including the establishment of a list of experts \nmaintained at the EU Focal Point.54 A single paragraph is dedicated to the integrity of \nthe Rome Statute and provides for the application mutatis mutandis of Sections A and \nB of the Action Plan.55 The independence and effective functioning of the ICC will be \nachieved by measures such as the transparent selection, nomination, election and \nsubsequent training of the ICC judges, prosecutors and staff56 and the prompt transfer \nof contributions to the ICC.57 In addition, Member States are encouraged to contribute \nto the Special Working Group on the crime of aggression,58 to put in place legislation \nnecessary to implement the Rome Statute59 including the Agreement on Privileges and \n                                                 \n \n47 Doc 5742\/04 LIMITE, Action Plan to follow-up on the Common Position on the International \nCriminal Court, Brussels, 28 January 2004.

The detailed mandate of the EU Focal Point can be found in the \nAnnex to the Action Plan. \n50 Ibid, Section B.1(ii). \n51 Ibid, Section B.2(i). \n52 Ibid, Sections B.3(iii)-(viii). \n53 Ibid, Sections B.3(ix)-(xi). \n54 Ibid, Section B.3(xii). \n55 Ibid, Section B.3(xiii). \n56 Ibid, Sections C.2(i), (iv). \n57 Ibid, Section C.2(iii). \n58 Ibid, Section C.2(vii). \n59 Ibid, Section C.2(viii). \n7 \n \n \n \nImmunities of the ICC,60 to cooperate with the ICC in the investigation and \nprosecution of crimes within its jurisdiction, in particular through the provision of \njudicial assistance, compliance with requests for arrest and surrender and the \nenforcement of sentences61 and promote effective cooperation between national and \nEuropean law enforcement and immigration authorities and the ICC.62  \n Overall, the Action Plan is an amalgam of aspirational rhetoric and down-to-\nearth practical measures. It has become highly influential in EU policy-making while \nthe success of achieving the objectives set has been mixed. Together with the \nCommon Position, the Action Plan provides the framework of all direct EU action on \nthe ICC and lay the foundations of the relationship between the Union, the Court and \nindividual Member States.  \n \nImplementing the Rome Statute \n \n The section that follows concerns the implementation of the ICC obligations \nby the EU. Following some introductory remarks, this part will examine the measures \ntaken by the EU in order to implement the cooperation obligations stemming from the \nRome Statute. In addition, legislation adopted in the field of Police and Judicial \nCooperation in Criminal Matters on an EU level, which albeit not ICC-specific is of \nimmediate relevance to the ICC, will be examined. Such legislation raises issues of \njudicial protection and respect for fundamental rights in the European Union which \nwill be addressed, prior to analysing the measures taken in order to achieve the \nuniversality and integrity of the Rome Statute. The final issue to be examined is that \nof EU Member State coordination in the ASP.  \n The Rome Statute cannot operate independently of State action. The \nincorporation into domestic law of certain Statute provisions is necessary for its \nprocedures to gain meaning and effectiveness nationally. Implementation falls within \nthe competence of individual Member States. To assess the reaction of the EU on the \nissue, an overview of some fundamental questions as to why, when and how a State \nmust engage in the process is necessary. Not all of the Rome Statute provisions need \nto be implemented. This obligation is limited to the cooperation part of the ICC \nStatute63 and does not extend to the substantive criminal law provisions, whose \nimplementation remains at the discretion of the State concerned.64  \n Despite the merits of enacting national legislation, States have generally not \ntaken up the implementation challenge.65 To do it properly, implementation requires \nexpert knowledge and adequate resources. The Rome Statute is a highly complex \n                                                 \n \n60 Ibid, Section C.2(x). \n61 Ibid, Section C.2(ix). \n62 Ibid, Section C.2(xi). \n63 Article 88 Rome Statute states: \u201cStates Parties \u2026 shall ensure that there are procedures available \nunder their national law for all of the forms of co-operation which are specified under this Part.\u201d \n64 Fourth and sixth preambular paragraphs of the Rome Statute. Neither the preamble nor the reference \ntherein are binding. Furthermore, the argument that the relevant preambular paragraphs codify existing \ncustomary law which obliges implementation is no more convincing. For this argument, see Jann K \nKleffner, \u201cThe Impact of Complementarity on National Implementation of Substantive International \nCriminal Law\u201d (2003) 1 Journal of International Criminal Justice 86 at pp. 90-94. \n65 Of the 105 State parties to date, only approximately one third have enacted ICC implementing \nlegislation. For a complete catalogue of all available implementing legislation see: \nhttp:\/\/www.nottingham.ac.uk\/law\/hrlc\/international-criminal-justice-unit\/implementation-database.php  \n8 \n \n \n \nlegal instrument which requires good understanding of international criminal law of \nthe national drafters. Undoubtedly, implementation takes time.66 The Rome Statute \ndoes not specify when implementation ought to take place. States are at liberty to \ndecide whether to implement before or after ratification. Since the ICC became \noperational in July 2002, however, State parties may be required to execute an ICC \ncooperation request which requires available procedures nationally. In practice, most \nStates become parties to the Rome Statute first and implement its terms afterwards.67  \n A State\u2019s ability to implement may be affected by certain provisions found in \nits constitution as well as the legal system that the State in question follows. \nProvisions in the Rome Statute may conflict with various constitutional guarantees68 \nthe resolution of which may lead to delays in implementation and may prove \nproblematic in practice, particularly regarding the execution of an ICC cooperation \nrequest. The European Commission for Democracy (Venice Commission) of the \nCouncil of Europe has identified the following areas as potentially conflicting with \nthe ICC regime:69 \n\u201c[The] immunity of persons having an official capacity; the obligation for states to surrender \ntheir own nationals to the court at its request; the possibility for the court to impose a term of \nlife imprisonment; exercise of the prerogative of pardon; execution of requests made by the \ncourt\u2019s Prosecutor, amnesties decreed under national law or the existence of a national statute \nof limitation; and the fact that persons brought before the court will be tried by a panel of \nthree judges rather than a jury.\u201d \n A State facing constitutional incompatibilities essentially has two options: It \nmay either amend the conflicting constitutional provisions or interpret them in such a \nway so as to allow for the application of the ICC regime.70 Other delays may ensue \nowing to the model a State follows regarding the incorporation of international law \nwithin its domestic legal system.71 States that follow the dualist tradition require \n                                                 \n \n66 Even when the political will is present, the drafting of legislation and its subsequent approval by the \nrelevant body, usually the national Parliament, take a substantial amount of time. \n67 The United Kingdom is a good example of a state which implemented first and ratified later. The \nInternational Criminal Court Act 2001 (UK) was passed on 24 September 2001 and entered into force \non 17 December 2001. The United Kingdom's instrument of ratification was deposited on 4 October \n2001, once the Act had been passed. \n68 See, for example, Helen Duffy, \u201cNational Constitutional Compatibility and the International Criminal \nCourt\u201d (2001) 11 Duke Journal of Comparative & International Law 5; Darryl Robinson, \u201cThe Rome \nStatute and its Impact on National Law\u201d in Antonio Cassese, Paolo Gaeta and John RWD Jones (eds), \nThe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: A Commentary, vol II, (Oxford University \nPress, Oxford, 2002), p. 1849; Venice Commission of the Council of Europe (Venice Commission) \n\u201cReport on Constitutional Issues Raised by the Ratification of the Rome Statute of the International \nCriminal Court Adopted by the Commission at its 45th Plenary Meeting (Venice, 15-16 \nDecember2000)\u201d (15 January 2001) CCDL-INF (2001) 1. \n69 Ibid. [footnotes omitted]. \n70 For example, in France, the Head of State cannot be prosecuted before the national courts.  \nTherefore, an amendment was made to Article 53-2 of the French Constitution of 1958 to recognise the \njurisdiction of the ICC so that any proceedings against the Head of State can take place before the ICC.  \nSee Antoine Buchet, \u201cL\u2019int\u00e9gration en France de la Convention portant statut de la Cour p\u00e9nale \ninternationale: histoire br\u00e8ve et inachev\u00e9e d'une mutation attendee\u201d in Claus Kre\u03b2 and Flavia Lattanzi \n(eds.), The Rome Statute and Domestic Legal Orders; General Aspects and Constitutional Issues, vol 1, \n(Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft, Baden-Baden, 2000), p. 65. \n71 For a more detailed and sophisticated analysis, see Ian Brownlie, Principles of Public International \nLaw, 6th edition, (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2003), at pp. 31-33; L Ferrari-Bravo, \n\u201cInternational and Municipal Law: The Complementarity of Legal Systems\u201d in R StJ MacDonald and \nD M Johnston (eds), The Structure and Process of International Law: Essays in Legal Philosophy, \nDoctrine and Theory, (Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1983), p. 715; Joseph G Starke, \u201cMonism and \n9 \n \n \n \nincorporating legislation to give effect to an international treaty at the domestic level. \nStates following the monist legal tradition may \u2013 mistakenly perhaps \u2013 assume that \nthere is no need to provide for implementing legislation.72 Whichever the case,73 it is \nin any case important to emphasise that even if the crimes provisions of the Rome \nStatute could be directly relied upon in the domestic legal order, the cooperation \nregime would need further implementation. A state needs to specify in its legislation \nwhich is the competent authority, among others, to receive the cooperation request or \nto arrest the suspect and transfer them to the ICC.74 Hence, the existence of legislation \nin place is necessary; and this is independent of the legal system followed and \ncommon to both monist and dualist traditions. \n Taking into account the above need for enactment of ICC implementing \nlegislation, the EU Member States have been distinguished for the rate of \nimplementation of the ICC obligations. In fact, the majority of the States which have \npassed legislation are EU Member States.75 This reveals a possible connection \nbetween the higher implementation rate and membership of the EU. It may indirectly \nbe attributed to the enhanced interest which the active involvement of many EU \nMember States in the drafting of the Rome Statute may have generated, peer pressure \nand the active promotion of the ICC by the EU.76 Despite the success in general \nterms, EU Member State implementation cannot be perceived to match the rhetoric of \nthe Union\u2019s Common Position. Plenty of European States, particularly from the so-\ncalled \u201cNew Europe\u201d, have not yet enacted legislation, following thus the global \nend.77  \n                                                                                                                                           \ntr\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDualism in the Theory of International Law\u201d (1936) 17 British Yearbook of International Law 66; \nFelice Morgenstern, \u201cJudicial Practice and the Supremacy of International Law\u201d (1950) 27 British \nYearbook of International Law 42. \n72 The monist tradition dictates that when a state ratifies an international agreement, the self-executing \nprovisions of that treaty apply directly in domestic law and prevail over conflicting domestic \nprovisions.

The Court does not \npossess an international police force of its own, and relies on States to perform all \ncooperation tasks.78 Cooperation with the ICC is both a Member State and an EU \nmatter. EU Member States that are Parties to the ICC Statute are under an obligation \nto execute a cooperation request made by the Court.79 Moreover, cooperation of \nintergovernmental organisations, such as the EU, is important for the ICC to \nadequately perform its functions. Recognition of the significance of the role that \ninternational organisations may play in post-conflict situations or situations where \nserious disturbances have occurred, in which the ICC operates as well as the \nassistance such organisations may provide to the Court, led to the inclusion of Article \n87(6) Rome Statute, which enables the ICC to request assistance from \nintergovernmental organisations.80 The emphasis of this Article on the provision of \ninformation or documents may be explained in that this would be the most common \nform of assistance these organisations would be able to provide the Court with. Other \nforms of cooperation, including, arguably, requests for arrest and surrender, are not \nal Member States have with the Court. In fact, it is made explicit \n                                                \nprecluded in Article 87(6) but should be seen in light of the organisation\u2019s constituent \ninstrument and certainly \u201cin accordance with its competence or mandate\u201d.81 \n An international agreement which defines the terms of cooperation and \nassistance between the EU and the Court has been concluded.82 The origin of the \nAgreement can be found in a request made by the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of \nthe ICC to the EU regarding strategic information from the EU on issues of concern to \nthe OTP\u2019s investigations.83 The Agreement which was concluded by the EU, on the \nbasis of Article 24 TEU,84 has narrow scope and is limited to the hardcore elements of \ncooperation and assistance, focussing, as per Article 87(6) Rome Statute, on the \nprovision of information or documents. The Agreement is not intended to supplant the \nrelationship individu\n \nr referrals, cannot rely on the United Nations (UN) Security Council \nperation. \nr the initiation of an investigation from such \non and \n on the 1st of May 2006. \n \n78 As Antonio Cassese, the first president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \nYugoslavia (ICTY), observed in his paper \u201cOn the Current Trends towards Criminal Prosecution and \nPunishment of Breaches of International Humanitarian Law\u201d (1998) 9 European Journal of \nInternational Law 2 at p. 8, \u201c[The] ICTY is very much like a giant without arms and legs \u2013 it needs \nartificial limbs to walk and work. And these artificial limbs are state authorities. If the cooperation of \nstates is not forthcoming, they cannot fulfil their functions.\u201d  This statement is even more relevant with \nregard to the ICC, which, except fo\nfor the monitoring of coo\n79 Art. 86 Rome Statute. \n80 The Prosecutor may also request assistance fo\norganisations in accordance with Article 15(2).  \n81 This is also reiterated in Article 54(3)(c) Rome Statute. \n82 Agreement between the International Criminal Court and the European Union on cooperati\nassistance, O.J.

The approach taken \nreplicates the general practice in international criminal justice institutions and other \nintergovernmental organisations, where the former makes a request and the latter \nproceeds with its execution.87 In addition, there is provision for regular exchange of \ninformation and documents.88 Those are EU documents containing EU classified \ninformation and not documents of the Member States.89 Moreover, in relation to \nclassified information the Agreement provides a detailed account of the rules and \nprocedures governing such surrender.90 Similar arrangements apply to cooperation \nbetween the EU and the Prosecutor.91 Information shall not take only documentary \nform but, in addition, testimony of staff of the European Union may be requested.92 \nOther provisions of the Agreement include the obligation of the EU to waive the \nPrivileges and Immunities of a person within the scope of the ICC, where appropriate, \nin order to allow the Court to exercise its jurisdiction,93 the conditions under which \n the Privileges and Immunities of the \n                                                \nthe EU may offer gratis personnel,94 services and facilities to the ICC,95 and the EU\u2019s \nassistance in training of judges, prosecutors, officials and counsel.96 \n The provisions of the EU-ICC Agreement are by and large uncontroversial. It \nshould be noted however that the tenor of the Agreement is particularly deferential \ntowards the EU. In particular, the legal obligations enshrined in the EU-ICC \nAgreement are subject to respect and with due regard to the EU Treaty and the \nrelevant rules thereunder.97 Regarding privileges and immunities, despite the ICC \nStatute providing that the official capacity is irrelevant,98 at the same time, the \nprivileges and immunities of EU officials and third party representatives accredited to \nthe EU form part of primary Union law.99 This harbours potential for conflict. \nHowever, the issue should not be overestimated. In addition to the deferential framing \nof the EU\u2019s obligations, these provisions have been carefully drafted to avoid such a \nlegal impasse. For instance, the obligation to furnish information or documents under \nArticle 11 EU-ICC Agreement is balanced by guarantees of the confidentiality of the \ninformation provided. Likewise, the Protocol on\n \n \ning Compelled to Answer Questions on Grounds \n, 27 May 2006. \n-ICC Agreement \nropean \nd Article 12 Privileges and Immunities of the EU-ICC Agreement. \n.1967. \n85 See Recital 10 and also implicitly Articles 2(1) and 3(1) EU-ICC Agreement.  \n86 It stipulates eg where correspondence will be addressed to.

An interesting example \nof such cooperation would include an EU freezing of assets order to implement a \ncooperation request under Article 93(1)(k) of the Rome Statute. The legal basis for the \nadoption of such orders remains a matter of controversy in EU law. While in terrorist \ncases, freezing of assets orders against terrorist organisations and individuals have \nbeen based on an a Common Position (Second Pillar) followed by an EC Regulation \nbased on Articles 60, 301 and 308 EC Treaty (First Pillar),101 freezing of assets orders \nagainst Karad\u017ei\u0107, Mladi\u0107 and Gotovina in order to implement the mandate of the \nICTY have been based on a Council Common Position without any subsequent First \nPillar measure.102 The choice of the method for adoption of an ICC-related EU \nas in which there is scope for conflict, \nthe existing good will, will hopefully lead to a practical coordination of activities, \n-making \n                                                \nfreezing of assets order, albeit controversial in itself, will determine issues of judicial \nprotection and respect for fundamental rights and will be analysed below.  \n The current content of the EU-ICC Cooperation Agreement is not expected to \nraise many problems in its application and guarantees a functional relationship \nbetween the EU and the ICC. Even in the are\nleaving no room for institutional antagonism. \nMember State Cooperation: The influence of Third Pillar measures  \n \n In recent years the EU has been particularly active in adopting measures in the \nfield of Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters (Third Pillar). Such \nmeasures may potentially influence Member State cooperation with the ICC. For the \nmost part, these measures do not entail ICC-specific obligations. However, the \nestablishment of the ICC as a horizontal consideration on the EU policy\nagenda reveals that, when opportune, the EU has included reference to instruments \nthat would assist Member States carry out a cooperation request by the ICC. \n More specifically, significant work has been done in the field of extradition \nwhich culminated in the adoption of the European Arrest Warrant (EAW).103 The \nFramework Decision provides a long list of offences attracting the issue of a EAW \nand, for a first time in a Third Pillar instrument, this includes crimes within the \njurisdiction of the ICC.104 The Rome Statute distinguishes between surrender which \ncovers the delivering of a person by a State to the Court and extradition which \n \n \nndation v.

However, the \napplication of the EAW to aid an ICC-related cooperation request cannot be \n identical to the EAW also includes crimes within the jurisdiction of the \nC.110\nis permissive of such eventuality. In particular, \nforthcoming. As is also apparent in the Council Decision on investigation and \ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, such expansive interpretation \nshould be excluded.114 After all, the Council Decision clearly limits itself to acts by \nprecluded. In fact, the EAW offers the tools to the EU Member States to fully \ncooperate with the ICC.106 Along the same lines, a related legal instrument of \npotentially great significance is the proposed European Evidence Warrant.107  \n Another instrument which the EU adopted under the Third Pillar is a \nFramework Decision on the execution in the European Union of orders freezing \nproperty or evidence.108 The purpose of this Framework Decision is to establish the \nrules under which a Member State will recognise and execute in its territory a freezing \norder issued by a judicial authority of another Member State.109 The list of offences \nwhich is\nIC  This would facilitate Member States in the execution of  a request for the \nfreezing of assets of a person indicted by the ICC under Article 93(1)(k) of the Rome \nStatute. \n Having a look at the broader picture, Police and Judicial Cooperation in \nCriminal Matters in the European Union is implemented primarily through the \nEuropean Police Office (Europol) and the European Judicial Cooperation Unit \n(Eurojust).111 Despite the substantive focus of the Third Pillar on organised crime, \nlegal instruments adopted thereunder have included the investigation and prosecution \nof crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the ICC. Does this entail a role for Europol \nand Eurojust at the implementation of the Rome Statute? At the outset, it must be \npointed out that the ICC context \nArticle 87(1)(b) Rome Statute provides that requests for cooperation may be \nchannelled either through the International Criminal Police Organization or any \nappropriate regional organization.  \n Reality however, is daunting. There is no specific role for Europol and it \nshould be assumed that it is excluded from enforcing ICC obligations in the EU.112 \nAlthough it may be argued in theory that the expansion of the list of offences which \nfall within the competence of Europol is possible,113 no such initiative has been \n                                                 \n \n105 Article 102 Rome Statute. \n106 Luisa Vierucci, \u201cThe European Arrest Warrant: An Additional Tool for Prosecuting ICC Crimes\u201d \n(2004) 2 Journal of International Criminal Justice 275 at p. 277. \ns in criminal matters, Brussels, \nly 2003 on the execution in the European \n property or evidence, O.J.

However, the possibility of involving \nEurojust in future cooperation requests should not be excluded and the signs are \nalready there. For instance, on 10 April 2007 the OTP and Eurojust signed a Letter of \nUnderstanding.116 The Letter promulgates their agreement to enhance contacts \nbetween them, to explore areas of co-operation and to exchange experiences of a non-\noperational nature. More specifically, the agreement aims to promote the sharing of \ngeneral and specific information about serious and organised crime that may be of \nmutual interest and benefit. Finally, the Letter of Understanding also expresses the \nintent to explore forging a formal cooperation agreement in the future. Eurojust could \nprove to be crucial to the OTP\u2019s mandate. Eurojust\u2019s remit and experience in dealing \nwith serious cross-border crime might prove to be key in the arrest and surrender of \nindividuals sought by the Prosecutor for trial before the ICC. Yet, both Eurojust and \nEuropol mandates should be stretched to enable them to prosecute and investigate \ncrimes falling within the jurisdiction of the ICC.117  \n Given the breadth of the EU activities in the Justice and Home Affairs area of \nUnion competence, a certain degree of effect on ICC matters is to be expected. \nAlthough such Third Pillar measures are not directly linked to the EU\u2019s direct ICC \ninitiatives, they may assist in increasing the level of assistance provided to the Court. \nPerhaps greater coordination and closer monitoring of such Third Pillar developments \nis required so as to have a more complete picture of the Union\u2019s action on ICC-related \nmatters. This in turn, would ensure the coherent and consistent furtherance of the \nactivities of the Union in the above area with regard to the ICC. \nInvestigation and Prosecution: ICC-specific EU measures \n \n The ICC co-exists with national courts and is not intended to replace or \ndisplace them.

In particular, the Court held that \u201cthe institutions are subject to \nreview of the conformity of their acts with the Treaties and the general principles of \nlaw, just like the Member States when they implement law of the Union.135  \n The review of Union acts is dependent on the Court of Justice\u2019s jurisdiction \nunder the Third Pillar. To start with, the ECJ\u2019s jurisdiction is governed by Article 35 \nTEU and is divided into preliminary rulings from national courts and direct challenges \nin the ECJ brought by a Member State or the Commission. The heads of jurisdiction \nare exhaustively listed in this Article136 and, accordingly, Third Pillar Common \nPositions are in principle excluded from the Court\u2019s jurisdiction.137 Remarkably, by \nmaking a further analogy to well-established Community principles, the Court held \nthat all measures adopted by the Council, whatever their nature or form, which are \nintended to have legal effects in relation to third parties, can be challenged.138 Hence, \nif the Court is faced with a Third Pillar Common Position which generates legal \neffects for third parties, it will accord the act its tru\npr nary ruling.139 In relation to the freezing of assets discussed above, were the \nEU to expand its cooperation with the Court and adopt an EU freezing order on the \nbasis of a Second Pillar Common Position, following the ICTY model, would such \norder, after Segi, be reviewed by the Court of Justice?140 Although the Court\u2019s \njudgment is framed in general terms \u201call measures adopted by the Council\u201d,141 its \napplication should be limited to Third Pillar matters as the jurisdiction of the Court \nunder the Second Pillar is altogether excluded.142 \n Going onto the preliminary rulings jurisdiction of the Court, this includes \n                                                 \n \n133 Case C-105\/03 Pupino [2005] ECR I-5285 at paragraph 34. \n134 Ibid, at paragraph 36. \n135 Case C-303\/05 Advocaten voor de Wereld VZW v.

A Member State must make a \nas been \nprecise, it answered the question which was \ndeclaration accepting the Court\u2019s jurisdiction and specify which national courts (any \ncourt or tribunal or a court or tribunal of a Member State against whose decision there \nis no judicial remedy) shall have the right to make a reference.144 The latest available \ndata indicate that only 14 Member States have made such a declaration.145 Out of \nthose, in Spain and Hungary, only final instance courts may refer the case to the Court \nof Justice.146  \n There are some interesting considerations which access to the Court\u2019s \njurisdiction under the Third Pillar generates. It must be pointed out at the outset that \nall national courts have jurisdiction to review national measures implementing Union \nacts against their own constitutional rules even if they have not accepted the Court\u2019s \njurisdiction.147 In this respect, national courts have been recently faced with \nchallenges against national legislation implementing the EAW.148 Obviously, when \nthe implementing national measures depart from the Union act they implement, \nnational courts can always review the manner in which State discretion h\nexercised under both national constitutional rules and fundamental rights as general \nprinciples of Community law. When however the Union act has been implemented \nverbatim such review indirectly entails the review of the Union act by the national \ncourt and there are many legitimate reasons in Union law why a national court would \nrefrain from doing this.149 This is a good example of a case in which the national court \nmay want to make a reference for a preliminary ruling on validity from the Court. \n What if there are no implementing national measures? The Segi judgment \nindirectly addresses the issue.150 The applicants in this case were included in a list of \nterrorists annexed to a Common Position adopted under both the Second and Third \nPillars.151 Instead of requesting the review of the lawfulness of the Common Position, \nthey applied for compensation for the harm suffered as a result of their inclusion to \nthe list.152 Having been asked the wrong question the Court appears, at a first glance, \nto give the wrong answer or, to be more \nnot asked, namely whether the lawfulness of Common Positions can be reviewed by \nthe Court. As explained above, it held that they can if they create legal effects for \n                                                 \n \n143 Segi, op. cit. supra, at paragraphs 44-46. \n144 Article 35(2)-(3) TEU. \n. \nlts in the non-\nst Warrant.

It held: \n\u201cFinally, it is to be borne in mind that it is for the Member States and, in particular, their \ncourts and tribunals, to interpret and apply national procedural rules governing the exercise of \nrights of action in a way that enables natural and legal persons to challenge before the courts \nthe lawfulness of any decision or other national measure relating to the drawing up of an act \nof the European Union or its application to them and to seek the compensation for any loss \nsuffered.\u201d155  \nThereby, the Court directed the applicants towards national courts and encouraged \nthem to challenge \u201cnational measures relating to the drawing up of an act\u201d, for \ninstance, a request by Spain for the inclusion of the applicants\u2019 name in the Annex to \nthe Common Position, \u201cor to its application\u201d, for instance, interrogation and arrest, \n\u201cand to seek compensation for any loss suffered\u201d. These are separate causes of action \nhowever, and the harmful impact of the Common Position per se is still not addressed. \nThis is of course unless the Court implies that the applicant may sue the President of \nthe Council of the European Union \u2013 the person having signed the Union act \u2013 in a \nnational court for defamation. In all cases, if the incidental review of the lawfulness of \nthe Union act becomes necessary to enable the national court to give judgment the \nnational court would want to make a reference to the Court of Justice for a \npreliminary ruling on validity.156 If the national court is barred from doing so because \nthe Member State at issue has not accepted the jurisdiction of the Court we are back to \nsquare one, and the question of availability of a remedy re-emerges.  \n From all examples mentioned above it appears that the question of effective \njudicial protection is inextricably linked to and dependent upon the national \ndeclaration accepting the Court\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 35.

A look at the ratification charts, reveals that membership of \nthe Court amongst EU Member States is almost universal.159 The Common Position \nwas adopted before the 2004 enlargement. It provided in Recital 3 that all Member \nStates had ratified the Rome Statute. The acceding Member States expressed their \nintention to apply the Common Position from the date of its adoption, almost a year \nior topr  their formal accession to the Union.160 Nevertheless, not all acceding States \nratified the Rome Statute in time for their accession and insofar as the Czech Republic \nis concerned, the Rome Statute has not been ratified to date.161 The issue has been \ngiven no attention in the Commission\u2019s monitoring report.162 In fact, in contrast to the \nemphatic statement in the Common Position that all Member States have ratified the \nRome Statute, the Action Plan a year later provides that they, where appropriate, will \nendeavour to put in place as soon as possible legislation necessary to implement the \nRome Statute.163 Similarly, the Member States are encouraged to ratify the Agreement \non Privileges and Immunities of the ICC.164  \n There are awkward repercussions from this which become immediately \napparent. The EU Member State which has not ratified the Rome Statute and is not \nbound by it, finds itself bound by measures adopted to give effect to the Rome Statute \nand facilitate the achievement of its objectives.165 Despite the stated intention to \nengage the Czech Republic with the ICC pursuant the universality objective, the \nmeans at the EU\u2019s disposal are limited. The Common Position constitutes a Second \nPillar instrument and as such the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice is excluded.166 In \nthis respect, there is no enforcement procedure similar to the one followed under \nArticle 226 of the EC Treaty under the Second Pillar in order to secure compliance of \nl ratification of the Rome Statute, while at the same time it does not have \ne tools at its disposal to demand such conduct from a Member State. While this is \nnot the first instance of double standards between EU internal and external \nthe Member States with the Common Position.

All recent negotiating mandates included an ICC clause.171  \n Faithful to the commitments undertaken by the Common Position and \nelaborated in the Action Plan, the European Union has included an ICC clause in the \nmultilateral agreement with the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. The \nrecently revised Development Cooperation Agreement with the ACP countries \n(Cotonou Agreement) constitutes an important in coverage and political impact \nagreement.172 However, Article 11 which contains the ICC clause falls under the \nheading \u201celement of the political environment\u201d and not an \u201cessential element\u201d of the \nAgreement, which mitigates its efficacy as there is no possibility of suspending aid on \nthe basis of lack of compliance with t\nAgreement reads:  \n\u201cIn promoting the strengthening of peace and international justice, the Parties reaffirm their \ndetermination to: \n- share experience in the adoption of legal adjustments required to allow for the ratification \nand implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; and \n- fight against international crime in accordance with international law, giving due regard to \nthe Rome Statute.

Ever since the creation of the ad \n lead into the discussion \nsist States in finding the right approach that best fits their individual \nstem\n This latter provision is wider than trials at the ICC. \nhoc Tribunals the peace and justice debate has been central to international criminal \nlaw.173 Given that the ICC operates in situations where peace is likely to have been \ndisturbed, the relationship between peace and justice is going to be of importance to \nthe ICC as well, which is why this is also reflected in the ICC Statute.174  That the EU \ntherefore mentions peace and justice in Article 11 is a suitable\nof the two areas covered by this Article.  \n The first priority of Article 11(6) is ICC ratification and implementation of the \nRome Statute. The two are accurately given equal importance. For, ratification and \nimplementation are interconnected. This is recognised by the EU which for the first \ntime positively encourages the sharing of States\u2019 experiences in adjusting their legal \nsystems in order to allow for ratification and implementation. \n Experience sharing will help alleviate some of the burden smaller or less \ndeveloped countries face when making the changes necessary nationally to ratify or \nimplement the Statute. Putting the procedures in place and enabling a State to \ncooperate fully with the Court and to prosecute domestically, is not an easy task. \nHowever, all 105 State parties to the ICC will eventually go through this process. \nInevitably, some patterns ought to develop and similar approaches will be formulated, \nwhich will as\nsy . Article 11(6) Cotonou Agreement does not outline the exact mechanism to \nachieve this exchange of experience. The Court\u2019s Legal Tools project, however, \naspires to provide the answer to this question.175  Undertaking this commitment under \nthe Cotonou agreement, is an important step in acknowledging that some legal \nadjustments are necessary, whilst rejecting their use as an excuse so as not to join the \nICC regime. \n Article 11(6) of the Cotonou Agreement further obligates State parties to it to \n\u201cfight against international crime in accordance with international law, giving due \nregard to the Rome Statute\u201d. \nNeither how States can fight international crime, nor what is meant by international \ncrime is specified in this instance. Reference to international crime here does not \ncover terrorism or weapons of mass destruction which are specifically covered for in \nthe Articles following on from Article 11. The wording of the Article does not \npreclude other international crimes from being considered, such as those covered by \ntransnational criminal law.176  \n This fight against international crime, may take place either on the \ninternational plane but also nationally. Reference to the Rome Statute is not exclusive. \nThe provision also makes reference to international law, thus accepting all available \nfora for the prosecution of international crimes such as international or \ninternationalised tribunals as well as national courts.177 What is striking however, is \n                                                 \n \n173 Paul R.

In relation to the European \nNeighbourhood Policy (ENP), it should be noted that ICC clauses have not been \ninserted to the existing agreements \u2013 either Partnership and Cooperation Agreements \nor Euro-Mediterranean Agreements \u2013 but are included in the ENP Action Plans as \npolitical documents.

A lot of ink has been spilled in analysing the US actions, with \nthe main emphasis being on the most potent of those, the Bilateral Immunity \nAgreements (BIAs).185 The purpose of these agreements is to p\nsurrendering any persons sought by the ICC. Although the legality of BIAs and their \nimpact on the Court have been the subject of much academic discussion,186 the EU\u2019s \nresponse remains largely unexplored. Clearly, such actions run counter to the stated \npolicy of the EU in support of the integrity of the Rome Statute.  \n In September 2002, the General Affairs and External Relations Council \nadopted its conclusions on the International Criminal Court.187  The conclusions serve \nmultiple aims. First, they reaffirm the EU\u2019s commitment to and support of the ICC, by \nreferring to and summarising the aims of the Common Position. Second, they provide \na common European front on the US objections, which are succinctly mentioned and \nsubtly disposed of in the second paragraph of the Conclusions. In the same paragraph, \nconfidence in the apolitical nature of the Court and in its complementarity regime is \nexpressed. Third, due emphasis is placed on the importance of re-engaging the US in \nthe international criminal law debate. However, no concrete measures are suggested \nas to how to achieve this. In fact, despite the stated intention of the EU to engage the \n                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe is posited as a short term priory in the Accession Partnership with Croatia.

They confirm the EU \nposition and implicitly reject the US efforts to thwart the Court\u2019s ambit. In terms of \nlegal effect, the conclusions do not contain any hard clauses for the Member States \ns up to the ICC regime. Due respect is therefore paid on existing \ninternational agreements to be considered. Although this is not further specified, other \nextradition agreements would conform to the typology of such international \nagreements. \n The Guiding Principles acknowledge that despite the clear EU position, some \nStates may still sign up to US BIAs. A number of safety clauses are contained in the \nGuiding Principles for this eventuality. States are encouraged to aim for a guarantee \nthat ICC crimes will be investigated and, provided that evidence is available, they will \n                                                \nand are of a declaratory nature.  \n Annexed to the above conclusions are a set of Guiding Principles. These \nspecifically target US non-surrender agreements and set out the EU response. \nInterestingly, the Guiding Principles do not distinguish between EU Member States \nand third countries. Obviously, having masterminded the wording of the Guiding \nPrinciples the Member States have expressed their intention to be bound by them. \nHowever, these also constitute a foreign policy statement addressed to all countries, in \nparticular the acceding States, the candidate States and the associated States.190 In \nrelation to the candidate States it also amounts to an accession condition.191 It \nbecomes clear thereby that the respect of the integrity of the ICC constitutes a \nfundamental element of the Union\u2019s foreign policy. More importantly, they contain \nuseful guidelines for States, which although non-binding, are capable of being \ninfluential on State policy. \n The Guiding Principles recapitulate the cooperation obligations of a State \nwhen it sign\nAgreements concluded under Article 98 Rome Statute, such as existing Status of \nForces Agreements.192 The EU Guiding Principles do not advocate forgoing of such \nagreements. This position is in line with the spirit of the Rome Statute provision. The \nmain focus of the Guiding Principles is on the US BIAs concluded specifically after \nthe entry into force of the ICC Statute. Such agreements, when concluded with ICC \nmembers, would be inconsistent with their pre-existing obligations under the Statute. \nThe Guiding Principles echo this approach. Moreover, they go a step further when \nthey maintain that such agreements \u201cmay [also] be inconsistent with other \ninternational agreements to which ICC States Parties are Parties\u201d.

A second requirement is that such agreements should only cover \nnationals of non-ICC parties. This principle stems from the fact that the Rome Statute, \nbeing an international treaty, is only opposable to States that are parties to it, and not \nthird States.193 Although the ICC would most commonly deal with nationals of State \nparties, it is foreseeable that crimes may be committed by third country nationals \npresent on the territory of a State party to the ICC. In such a case, the ICC potentially \nhas jurisdiction, based on the territoriality principle enshrined in Article 12 ICC \nStatute.194 The EU Guiding Principles are prepared to tolerate extradition of such an \nindividual to the US, rather than the Court. The ICC operates on the basis of the \ncomplementarity principle anyway, which gives an opportunity to any State willing \nand able to exercise jurisdiction to do so.195 This would not necessarily frustrate \n eye to some of the \nnciples contain a number of fallback positions.

However, if the US were unwilling or unable to investigate and \nprosecute, and extradition of the individual were to take place to that State, the EU \nGuiding Principles would essentially encourage turning a blind\nmost serious of crimes committed, which would consequently go unpunished.  \n Of considerable importance is the requirement established in the Guiding \nPrinciples for a sunset clause. The EU\u2019s approach on the issue acknowledges that if, \ndespite the strong encouragement not to, States enter into US agreements, they should \ndo so temporarily.

Member States are not only required to coordinate but also to \nactively contribute to the negotiations taking place in the Special Working Group \nestablished by the ASP to deal with the crime of aggression.204 \n In practice, unlike other fora, for instance the United Nations,205 the EU \nparticipation in the ICC ha\nthe State holding the EU Presidency took the floor on behalf of all the Member States \non numerous occasions to address the Conference and express the Union\u2019s position. \nThis common voice has continued in the ASP before which successive Presidencies \nand occasionally the High Representative for the CFSP have made statements \nrepresenting the Union.206 \n This rosy picture of Member State unity is tainted by the fact that, as \nmentioned above, the Czech Republic is not a party to the ICC. Naturally, the \nquestion arises: What will happen when the turn of Czech Republic comes to hold the \nrotating EU Presidency? From an ICC perspective, this should not cause too much of \na problem since the Czech Republic is a signatory of the Statute, it is entitled to \n                                                 \n \n196 For instance, the Non-Aligned Movement, the like-minded group of States, the Arab League etc. \n197 The question of single external representation of the Union dates back to Kissinger\u2019s well-known \nexclamation: \u201cIf I want to call Europe, whom do I call?\u201d. \n198 Koutrakos, supra note 22; Eeckhout, supra note 30; Rachel Frid, The Relations between the EC and \nions, Legal Theory and Practice, (Kluwer Law International, 1995); Karen E. \ngn Policy in a Changing World, (Polity Press, Cambridge, 2003). \nus and next Presidencies according to old Article J.5(3) TEU.

This two-pronged relationship with \ned the US offensive on the ICC \nA\nis no legal reason why the Czech Republic may not coordinate and represent the 27 \nMember States of the Union. It has been common in practice however, when the \nMember State holding the Presidency is not a Member of the international \norganisation at issue for the next Presidency to represent the Union instead. This is \nlikely to be the case with the ASP as well.208  \n  \nConcluding Remarks \n \n Whilst the jury is still out as to the actual impact the ICC as a mechanism of \ninternational criminal justice will have on ending impunity and restoring the rule of \nlaw, the Court\u2019s success as the main adjudicative body at the international level, lies \nnot only on its efficient operation, but also on its successful interaction with national \nand supranational legal orders.209 As the Court gains in experience through a fair and \nefficient h\ne ng international criminal justice system. Whereas the burden is likely to be \nmore on the individual Member States, which will be required to execute a wide range \nof cooperation requests and take upon themselves the task of conducting \ninvestigations and prosecutions at the national level, the Union as a whole, will \ncontinue to play an important role both in positively encouraging its constituting \nmembers to be \u201cgood international citizens\u201d, but also independently, and in its own \nname, in supporting the Court\u2019s d 210\nthe Court best reflects the internal and external functions of the EU in ICC-related \nmatters.  \n An active Union can be an asset to the Court, particularly when concerted EU \nactivities assist in furthering the Court\u2019s mission to end impunity for the most heinous \ninternational crimes. Not only has the EU provided the ICC with a firm commitment \non institutional cooperation and has heralded support through a number of initiatives \ninternally, but, most importantly, has counterbalanc\nthrough the means of ICC clauses in international agreements, an akin but much \nmilder version of anti-US BIAs.  \n The EU\u2019s approach towards the Court has, to date, been distinctly pro-ICC. \nThis does not preclude EU action running counter to the ICC in the future, or simply \nnot being fully compatible with the Court. In the current state of affairs in EU \nintegration, however, the possibilities of such conflicts seem practically limited. The \nreal challenge will be for the EU to develop its ICC-related approach without being \nhampered by its constitutional imperfections, and for the ICC to continue to rip the \nbenefits of a pro-ICC European Union in the future. \n The relationship between the ICC and the EU has so far been ad hoc. Besides \nthe functional aspects of the EU-ICC Cooperation Agreement, the rest of the EU \n                                                 \n \n207 Article 112 Rome Statute. \n208 Denza, supra note 201, at p. 163. \n209 See generally Jane Stromseth, \u201cPursuing Accountability for Atrocities After Conflict: What Impact \non Building the Rule of Law?\u201d (2007) 38 Georgetown Journal of International Law 251. \n210 For and interesting view of the European influence on States see Anne-Marie Slaughter and William \nBurke-White, \u201cThe Future of International Law is Domestic (Or, the European Way of Law)\u201d (2006) 47 \nHarvard International Law Journal 327. \n29 \n \n \n \n30 \n \n \n \ns, the EU seems to act beyond its remit from an EU constitutional \npective. However, this seems to be acceptable by the individual Member States \nwhich have, in most part, followed the approach taken by the Union. All EU \ninitiatives have so far been one-sided on behalf of the Union. The ICC has not taken \nany action to accommodate potential Union needs, nor should it have to. However, it \nhas benefited from the hands-on support provided freely by the EU. Although most of \nthe measures adopted so far contain at best the Union\u2019s aspirations towards the Court, \nrather than any concrete measures, they reveal a strong connection between the EU \nand the ICC. This connection has to be cherished as a success in effective \nmultilateralism benefiting both the EU activities in areas of considerable importance \nfor its moral and political standing, but also the ICC which finds in the EU an \ninvaluable partner.  \n     \ninitiatives have been undertaken without any formal coordination between the EU and \nthe Court. This atypical interaction which aims at the promotion of the ICC cause \nwithin the remit of the Union is loaded with a great political charge and is fully \ncompatible with the EU\u2019s human rights and democratic governance agenda. Given \nthat one fourth of the Court\u2019s membership is made up by EU Member States, the EU \nis the single largest block of States within the ICC constitution. This fact alone and \nthe possibility of an expansion of the Union, renders the EU-ICC relationship unique. \n In many way\npers\n"}
