Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al   \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nWine contains variable quantities of \ndifferent phenolic compounds which \nplay a key role in the flavour, \nparticularly in red wines. They are \nresponsible for some positive tasting \ncharacteristics, but also for some rather \nunpleasant, negative aspects. The ideal \nmethod for estimating the phenol \ncontent would be that allowing both to \ndefine all of these compounds and \nassay them separately. This is a time-\nconsuming alternative due to the \ndifficulty of analyzing all these com-\npounds which is not always possible \nnor necessary.  \nAn overall knowledge of the phenol \ncontent of wine, expressed as a numeri-\ncal value, provides winemakers with \nenough information about polyphenol \nconcentration. This makes possible to \nclassify wines according to their phenol \ncontent and measure the results of a \nwinemaking operation.  \nThe methods used for this measure-\nment must be rapid, the results obtained \nmust be reproducible and include all \ntypes of phenols. The Folin-Ciocalteau \nvalue [1] uses an oxidizing agent such \nas potassium permanganate, and the \nFolin-Ciocalteau reagent (mixture of \nphosphotungstic and phosphomolybdic \nacids) which react with phenols due to \ntheir reductive properties. A second \nvalue is based on the characteristic \nabsorption at 280 nm of the benzene \ncycles of the majority of phenols. The \nlatter seems to be preferable to the \nFolin-Ciocalteau test due to its \nspeedness and precision. \nAnthocyans (At) are present in wine \nin different forms: free anthocyans (Af) \nand anthocyans combined with tannins \n(Ac), some of which are bleached by \nSO2 (Ab), while the rest is unaffected \n(Au). So, At= Af +Ac = Af + Ab + Au . \nThere is not an accurate method for \nassaying anthocyans (At), so this value \nmay only be estimated. On the other \nhand, a global value for Af+Ab may be \ndetermined (As), using chemical \nmethods which are based on the proper-\nties of anthocyans either of bleaching \nby sulphur dioxide or colour variation \naccording to pH changes [2]. Both \nmethods measure As, however the \nmethod based on pH changes is more \naffected by the presence of free SO2 in \nwine and then the sulphur dioxide \nbleaching method is more reliable.  \nChromatography techniques such \nas low and high pressure liquid \nchromatography provide enough infor-\nmation only from simple and little-\npolimerised molecules. In addition, \ntheir cost make them unavailable to \nmany wineries. Research in this sense \nhas been developed using different \napproaches involving [3] or not \npretreatment steps [4,5].  \nThere are not methods in the \nanalytical literature for determining \nboth polyphenols and anthocyans in \nwines. Some references can be found \nabout polyphenols determination, and \nsome of them use flow injection in an \nattemp of automation. Buitrago et al. \n[6] developed a method adapted from \nthe Jerumanis one, which involves \nreaction of polyphenols with ammo-\nnium Fe(III) citrate to form a coloured \nTalanta, 2002, Vol. 56, 53-59   \n \n 3\ncomplex that absorbs at 525 nm. \nCeleste et al. [7] and Peris-Tortajada et \nal. [8] used the Folin-Ciocalteau \nreagent for implementing methods for \ndetermining total polyphenols by moni-\ntoring the reaction products spectro-\nphotometrically at 750 nm. A recent \nmethod measures the absorbance at 280 \nnm for determining polyphenol con-\ntents [9]. Only a method for the \ndetermination of anthocyans using flow \ninjection can be found in the analytical \nliterature [10]. Devoted to the determi-\nnation of some anthocyans, it is based \non the coupling of continuous liquid-\nsolid extraction, evaporation, individual \nseparation by HPLC and photometric \ndetection. The method was applied to \nthe determination of malvidin-3-gluco-\nside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-\nglucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside as a \ndemonstration of its performance for \nthe most and less concentrated of these \ncompounds in red wine.   \nThe aim of this research was the \ndevelopment of a continuous, flow \ninjection method for the simultaneous \ndetermination of total polyphenol index \nand anthocyan index which allows fast \nand cheap determinations thus pro-\nviding winemakers with an appropriate \ntool for knowing the total content of \nboth groups of compounds in the daily \nwork. \n \nExperimental \n \nApparatus and instruments  \nThe manifold used is outlined in Fig.1. \nIt was built using a four-channel Gilson \nMinipuls-3 peristaltic pump (Villiers le \nBel, France) fitted with a rate selector, \ntwo Rheodyne 5041 injection valves \n(Elkay, Galway, Ireland), one of them \nused as selecting valve, and PTFE \ntubing of 0.5 mm i.d. (Scharlau, \nBarcelona, Spain). An Agilent 8354 \n(Madrid, Spain) diode array spectro-\nphotometer equipped with a Hellma \n138-QS flow-cell (Hellma, Jamaica, \nNY) and connected to a computer with \nHewlett-Packard software for data \ncollection and treatment was also used. \n  \nFigure 1.

Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al   \n \n 4 \nReagents and solutions \nStandard solutions both for opti-\nmisation studies and calibration were \nprepared from commercial enocyanin \ndye (Laffort S.A., Guip\u00fazcoa, Spain), \ngallic acid (Sigma, Madrid, Spain) and \nabsolute ethanol (Panreac, Barcelona, \nSpain). The stock solution remained \nstable for 5 days when stored at 4 \u00baC in \ndark. \nFor the proposed method, the \ncarrier stream was an aqueous solution \nof 2% (v\/v) hydrochloric acid and a 2% \n(w\/v) potassium pirosulphite solution \n(K2S2O5) was used as a bleaching agent. \nFor the reference method, an aqueous \nsolution of 2% (v\/v) hydrochloric acid \nand a 15% (w\/v) solution of potassium \npirosulphite were used.   \nAll solutions were prepared using \ndoubly distilled water of high purity \nobtained from a Millipore Milli-Q plus \nsystem (Bedford, MA). \n \nReference procedures \n \nDetermination of the total polyphenol \nindex (I280) \nWine was diluted with water in a 1:100 \nratio and the absorbance was directly \nmeasured at 280 nm. The value of the \nI280 was calculated by multiplying the \nabsorbance x 100.   \n \nDetermination of the anthocyan index \n(Ribereau-Gayon method) \nTwo samples, each containing 1 ml of \nwine, 1 ml of ethanol 0,1% HCl and 20 \nml of 2% HCl (pH 0,8) were prepared. \n4 ml of H2O was added to 10 ml of one \nof the samples and 4 ml of potassium \npirosulphite solution, 15% w\/v, was \nadded to 10 ml of the other and both \nmixtures were diluted to a double \nvolume. The difference (\u2206d) of absorb-\nance between them was measured at \n520 nm in a 10 mm path length optical \ncell. By comparison with a standardised \nanthocyan solution, the concentration is \ngiven by the following equation:  \nC(mg\/l) = \u2206d x 875. \n \nProposed method \nFigure 1 shows the manifold used for \nthe simultaneous determination. The \nsample was introduced into the loop of \nthe injection valve (IV) by aspiration \nwith the selecting valve (SV) in the \nposition for supplying water. Valve IV \nwas turned to the injection mode and \nthe absorbances at 520 nm and 280 nm \nwere monitored. The data thus obtained \nenabled both calculation of the value of \ntotal polyphenol index (t.p.i.) through \nthe value of the absorbance at 280 nm \nand provided the value of absorbance at \n520 nm before bleaching by SO2 for the \ndetermination of the total anthocyan \nindex (t.a.i.). After this, SV was \nswitched to the position for aspirating \nK2S2O5 and a new sample aliquot was \ninjected. The absorbance at 520 nm was \nnow lower as a consequence of bleach-\ning of the fraction of anthocyans \ncombined with tannins (Ab). The dif-\nference of absorbance between the two \nmeasurements at 520 nm gave the As \nvalue.     \n \nResults and discussion \n \nOptimisation of the method \nTalanta, 2002, Vol. 56, 53-59   \n \n 5\nThe variables which affect the method \nfor the determination of total anthocyan \nindex (t.a.i.) and total polyphenol index \n(t.p.i.) were studied by a multivariate \napproach. These variables were opti-\nmised, first for anthocyans determina-\ntion and then for the total polyphenol \nindex. A compromise value from the \noptimal values obtained individually \nwas adopted, as shown in Table 1. \n \n \nTable 1.

The response \nsurface shows that the highest values of \nabsorbance are obtained with the largest \nsample volumes and the lowest values \nof flow-rate.  \nFigure 2.b shows a similar plot for \nthe total polyphenol index. A plateau of \nhigh absorbance (ca. 3 absorbance \nunits) is observed for a sample volume \nof 300 \u03bcl or higher at any flow-rate. \nAbsorbances close to 1.5 are obtained \nfor t.p.i. using a sample volume of 75 \u03bcl \nand a flow-rate of 0.8 ml min-1. With \nthese values of the variables the \nabsorbance is 0.5 for the same sample \nfor t.a.i. A sample volume of 75 \u03bcl and \na flow-rate of 0.8 ml min-1 were \nselected for further experiments. \nFigure 2.c shows the surface \nobtained by plotting the absorbance \nversus anthocyan (mg l-1) and piro-\nsulphite (% m\/v) concentrations. The \ncurve shows a constant absorbance for \npirosulphite concentrations of 4% or \nhigher for all anthocyans range of \nconcentrations. For this value (4%), the \nslope of the calibration curve was the \nhighest.  \nThe maximum values of absorb-\nance obtained with higher pirosulphite \nconcentrations were not chosen due to \nboth the agressive nature of pirosulphite \nfor the respiratory system and the good \nresponse obtained with 4% pirosulphite.  \nThe concentration of hydrochloric \nacid used as carrier was not optimised \nand was established at pH 0.8 required \nin order to maintain anthocyans in \nflavinium cationic form. This pH did \nnot modify the absorbace of poly-\nphenols at 280 nm. This fact was \nchecked in batch.  \nThe reactor R had as a function to \nprovide appropiate reagent\/sample mix-\nture before reaching the detector. A \nlength of 50 cm was sufficient for this \npurpose. \n \nCharacterisation of the method \n \nCalibration curves \nJ. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al   \n \n 6 \nA preliminary calibration curve for \neach analyte was run separately using \nstandardised solutions of gallic acid and \nenocyanin previously analised in \nduplicate by the reference method. \nThen, calibration curves were run for \nboth compounds in mixture. Six \nstandard solutions containing both \nanalytes were prepared with concen-\ntrations between 20 and 500 mg of \nanthocyans l-1 for anthocyans and \nbetween 20 and 70 in  I280 units for the \ntotal polyphenol index. Linear re-\nsponses were found in the range of \nconcentrations studied.  There was not \ninterference of each group of com-\npounds in the determination of the \nother. All standard were prepared \nweekly and sonicated before use in \norder  to avoid  irreproducibility due to  \nFigure 2.

A \nrobustness study was also developed. \nRepeatability (r).The Snedecor test \nwas applied in order to establish if the \ndifferences between repeatability of the \nmethods were significant. With this \naim, the Fobs=Sr2 \/ Sref2 was compared \nwith the F1-\u03b1 obtained from Snedecor \ntables for \u03b1=0.05 (P=95%). As can be \nobserved in Table 2, Fobs<F1-\u03b1 , so the \nrepeatabilities of the FI and reference \nmethod are similar for both parameters. \n \n  \n \nTable 2.

The regression \nequation is Y= 0.942X+2,74 (r=0.990). \nConfidence limits of 95% are shown in \nfigures 3.a and 3.b in discontinuous \nlines. In both cases traceability was \nassured using the t-test. The low \ncorrelation factor can be partially owing \nto the unaccuracy of the reference \nmethods used in both determinations \n(t.a.i. and t.p.i.).   \n \nSample throughput.The results in \nTable 2 show that the FI method has a \nglobal frequency higher than the \nreference methods made sequentially. \nThough the reference method for \ndetermining the total polyphenol index \nis a bit fastest than the t.p.i. FI method, \nthe highest sampling rate of the t.a.i. FI \nmethod as compared with the t.a.i. \nreference can justify by itself the use of \nthe proposed method. \n \n \nReference method\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\nFI\n m\net\nho\nd\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\ny=1,077 x -8,2\nr2=0,991\nReference method\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65\nFI\n m\net\nho\nd\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n520 nm\n280 nm\ny= 0,942 x + 2,74\nr2=0,990\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 3.

Interval \nof confidence 95%. \nTalanta, 2002, Vol. 56, 53-59   \n \n 9\nRobustness study.The study was \ndeveloped using the Younden-Steiner \nprocedure. Critical variables of the \nsystem are hydrochloric acid and \npirosulphite concentrations and flow-\nrate. These variables were modified \n\u00b125% of their optimum values. No \nsignificant changes were observed in \nany case for the total polyphenol index \ndetermination. In the case of total \nanthocyan index no significant changes \nwere observed by increasing the HCl \nand K2S2O5 concentrations. A 5% \ndecrease in the analytical signal can be \nobserved when decreasing the piro-\nsulphite concentration and no signifi-\ncant variation in the case of HCl. The \nflow-rate yielded changes of 7% in the \nanalytical signal in the range under \nstudy. \n \nConclusions \n \nBy taking into account that, (i) there is \nnot and accurate method for total \nanthocyans, (ii) this value may only be \nestimated, and that (iii) the polyphenol \nindex (I280) is a relative index of the \npolyphenol content in wine, the method \nproposed here enables the simultaneous \ndetermination of these two outstanding \nparameters in red wine with charac-\nteristics similar to or better than those \nof the existing methods. Thus, the pro-\nposed method is simple, inexpensive, \npresents a good correlation with the \nreference methods used commonly for \nthese analytes and can be easily \nimplemented in a cellar for monitoring \nred wine fermentation processes. Other \nadvantages of the method reported here \nare both a sampling throughput higher \nthan that of the methods used routinely \nin cellars and that it can be easily auto-\nmated.  \nThis method constitutes a unique \nsimultaneous application of flow \ninjection for determinations in red wine \nand offers the evident advantage of \ndetermining two parameters using the \nsame manifold, thus reducing time and \ncosts.  \nThis is the first time that a \ncontinuous simultaneous method for \ndetermining total polyphenol index and \ntotal anthocyans index is proposed and \nassessed for its routine use in cellars. \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nThe Spanish Comisi\u00f3n Interministerial \nde Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CICyT) is \nthanked for financial support (Project \nBQU 2000\/0241). \n \nReferences \n \n[1]  Recueil des m\u00e9thodes Inter-\nnationales d\u00b4Analyse des Vins et \ndes Mouts, Office International \nde la vigne et du vin, O.I.V., \nParis, France, 1990, p.269. \n[2] P.
