Introduction\nThis paper will study a Langevin equation for stochastic processes with values in a\nseparable complex Banach space E. The one-dimensional Langevin equation is the Ito\u02c6\ndifferential equation\ndZt + \u03c1Zt dt = dbt (1.1)\nfor t \u2208 R, where the constant \u03c1 > 0 describes a frictional resistance. We seek a pair of\nprocesses (bt, Zt), defined on a probability space (\u2126,F ,P), which solve equation (1.1);\nthe process (bt)t\u2208R is required to be a complex Brownian motion on the line with b0 = 0\nand the process (Zt)t\u2208R is required to be a complex-valued centred Gaussian stationary\nstochastic process which is adapted to the filtration induced by bt and has almost surely\nHo\u00a8lder continuous sample paths. The concept of a stationary stochastic process was\nintroduced by Khinchin in [20].\nIt is well known, following Uhlenbeck and Ornstein\u2019s paper [35], that solutions (bt, Zt)\nof equation (1.1) exist. The stationary process Zt is unique in distribution and called the\n301\n302 J. S. Groves\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process with parameter \u03c1. We may write Zt as a stochastic spectral\nintegral\nZt =\n1\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nei\u03c9t\n\u03c1+ i\u03c9\ndb\u02dc\u03c9, (1.2)\nwhere (b\u02dc\u03c9)\u03c9\u2208R is a given complex Brownian motion on the line defined on (\u2126,F ,P) with\nb\u02dc0 = 0. The process bt is given in terms of b\u02dc\u03c9 by the condition b0 = 0 and the stochastic\nspectral integral, for s < t,\nbt \u2212 bs = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nei\u03c9t \u2212 ei\u03c9s\ni\u03c9\ndb\u02dc\u03c9. (1.3)\nThe formulae (1.2) and (1.3) were originally derived by mathematicians developing the\ntheory of linear filters on stationary stochastic processes. Of note are Blanc-Lapierre and\nFortet\u2019s paper [1], which discusses the basic properties of filters, and Kolmogorov\u2019s paper\n[21], which discusses spectral representations of solutions to linear constant-coefficient\nstochastic differential equations: formula (24) of Kolmogorov\u2019s paper is a generalized\nform of (1.2). See Chapter XI of [11] for a detailed description of the spectral theory of\nscalar-valued stationary stochastic processes.\nAdaptedness of the process Zt to the filtration induced by bt follows from the existence\nof a time domain integral\nZt =\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\u03c1(t\u2212u) dbu, (1.4)\nwhich expresses Zt as a stochastic integral with respect to bt. All stochastic integrals are\ninterpreted in the Ito\u02c6 sense. The autocovariance of the process Zt is\nCov(Zs, Zt) =\ne\u2212\u03c1|s\u2212t|\n2\u03c1\n. (1.5)\nThe Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck process is Gaussian, strongly Markovian and stationary with\nalmost surely Ho\u00a8lder continuous sample paths.\nFor more information, particularly on the physical motivation for studying these pro-\ncesses, we refer the reader to [14] or [33].\nIn \u00a7 4 of this paper we consider a generalization of the Langevin equation to the Banach\nspace valued case. We let E be a separable complex Banach space and consider the\nstochastic differential equation\ndZt + \u039bZt dt = dBt (1.6)\nfor t \u2208 R, where \u039b is a closed operator from a norm dense domain D(\u039b) \u2286 E to E.\nWe seek a pair of processes (Bt,Zt), defined on a probability space (\u2126,F ,P), which\nare a weak solution to equation (1.6); the concept of a weak solution follows that of\nDa Prato and Zabczyk, for which see [6], and is defined formally in \u00a7 4. The process\n(Bt)t\u2208R is required to be an E-valued Q-Wiener process; our terminology for Wiener\nprocesses follows that used in [6]. The process (Zt)t\u2208R is required to be an E-valued,\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in Banach spaces 303\ncentred Gaussian, stationary stochastic process with almost surely Ho\u00a8lder continuous\nsample paths.\nWhen generalizing results on scalar-valued random variables and stochastic processes\nto the Banach space valued case, several problems arise concerning how to describe\nconcepts such as expectation, L2 boundedness, covariance and stationarity in a wider\nsetting. Section 2 of this paper uses ideas developed by Pisier in [32] to develop the\ntheory of Banach space valued random vectors with bounded variance.\nParticular use is made of a norm on spaces of random vectors equal to the 2-absolutely\nsumming norm on an associated space of linear operators; this norm is denoted by \u03c02.\nSection 3 of this paper characterizes Gaussian random vectors and Q-Wiener processes\nin a separable Banach space E using the \u03c02 norm; it is shown that, necessarily, Q factors\nthrough \u00062 as AA\u2217, where A is an operator from \u00062 to E with 2-summing adjoint. This\nfactorization condition is shown to be sufficient when E is of Gaussian type 2.\nSection 3 also considers the theory of stochastic integration in a separable Banach\nspace for continuous deterministic integrands with respect to a Q-Wiener process. The\nfollowing theorem is proved.\nTheorem 1.1. For E a separable Banach space, let Bt be an E-valued AA\u2217-Wiener\nprocess defined on a probability space (\u2126,F ,P). Then for s < t, if (Tu)s\u0001u\u0001t is a non-\nrandom family of bounded linear operators on E such that (A\u2217T \u2217u )s\u0001u\u0001t is continuous in\nthe \u03c02 norm, the stochastic integral\n\u222b t\ns\nTu dBu (1.7)\nexists as the limit in the \u03c02 norm of appropriate Riemann sums under refinement of\npartitions. Furthermore,\n\u03c02\n(\u222b t\ns\nTu dBu\n)2\n\u0001\n\u222b t\ns\n\u03c02(A\u2217T \u2217u )\n2 du. (1.8)\nIn cases where s is equal to \u2212\u221e and\/or t is equal to \u221e, we define the stochastic integral\nin a way that is analogous to the improper Riemann integral, that is as the limiting value\nof the integral as s decreases to \u2212\u221e and\/or t increases to \u221e, where this limiting value\nexists.\nHaving formalized the framework under which Banach space valued stochastic pro-\ncesses will be discussed, we prove the existence in \u00a7 4, under certain boundedness condi-\ntions on \u039b, of pairs of processes (Bt,Zt) which solve the Banach space valued Langevin\nequation in the weak sense.\nTheorem 1.2. Assume i\u039b and i\u039b\u2217 generate C0 groups of operators on E and the resol-\nvent of \u039b is uniformly bounded on the imaginary axis. Consider the stochastic spectral\nintegral\nZt =\n1\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nei\u03c9t(\u039b+ i\u03c9I)\u22121 dB\u02dc\u03c9, (1.9)\n304 J. S. Groves\nwhere B\u02dc\u03c9 is a given E-valued Q-Wiener process defined on (\u2126,F ,P). Define Bt subject\nto B0 = 0 and the stochastic spectral integral, for s < t,\nBt \u2212 Bs = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nei\u03c9t \u2212 ei\u03c9s\ni\u03c9\ndB\u02dc\u03c9. (1.10)\nThe processes Zt and Bt converge as stochastic integrals and the pair (Bt,Zt) is a weak\nsolution of equation (1.6).\nThe process Zt is a generalization to the E-valued case of the classical Ornstein\u2013\nUhlenbeck process. Such a generalization has been done previously, notably by Ito\u02c6 in [18];\nthe difference here is that our solution Zt is represented as a stochastic spectral integral,\nrather than an integral in the time domain.\nNote we do not require that Zt be adapted to the filtration induced by Bt. We obtain\nadaptedness in the important case where (\u2212\u039b) generates a C0 semigroup (e\u2212\u039bt)t\u00020 of\nexponential norm decay, however, by demonstrating the existence of a time domain inte-\ngral\nZt =\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\u039b(t\u2212u) dBu, (1.11)\nwhich expresses Zt as a stochastic integral with respect to Bt.\nSection 4 also considers some specific examples of E-valued Langevin equations and\ntheir weak solutions. Each example corresponds to an operator \u039b for which neither \u039b\nnor (\u2212\u039b) generate C0 semigroups of exponential norm decay.\n2. Banach space valued random vectors\nIn this section we develop the formalism we need to adequately deal with the theory of\nBanach space valued random vectors and their covariances. The ideas largely derive from\nPisier\u2019s paper [32]; further background information may be found in [10], [9] and [31].\nFollowing [32] we use positive sesquilinear forms to define a norm on Banach space\nvalued random vectors equal to the 2-absolutely summing norm on equivalent operators\nfrom the dual of that Banach space to a Hilbert space. This norm will enable us to bound\nvarious stochastic integrals in \u00a7 4.\n2.1. Definitions\nWe introduce some notation. For a complex vector space V , V\u00af denotes V endowed\nwith the conjugate scalar multiplication (\u03bb, v) \u0005\u2192 \u03bb\u00afv. Write v\u00af for v \u2208 V viewed as an\nelement of V\u00af .\nThroughout this paper, all adjoints of linear operators are to be interpreted in the\nBanach space sense.\nLet E and F be Banach spaces, let B(E) and B(F ) be the spaces of all bounded linear\noperators on E and F , respectively, and let B(E,F ) be the space of all bounded linear\noperators from E to F . We shall consider certain classes of norms on spaces of operators\nfrom E to F . Let A(E,F ) denote a subspace of B(E,F ) equipped with a norm \u03b1 under\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in Banach spaces 305\nwhich A(E,F ) is a Banach space. We say A(E,F ) is a Banach operator ideal, and \u03b1 is\nan operator ideal norm, if\n(i) for all \u03be\u2217 \u2208 E\u2217 and \u03b7 \u2208 F , the rank-one tensor \u03be\u2217 \u2297 \u03b7 \u2208 A(E,F ) and\n\u03b1(\u03be\u2217 \u2297 \u03b7) = \u2016\u03be\u2217\u2016E\u2217\u2016\u03b7\u2016F ; (2.1)\n(ii) for all u \u2208 A(E,F ), S \u2208 B(E) and T \u2208 B(F ), the product TuS \u2208 A(E,F ) and\n\u03b1(TuS) \u0001 \u2016T\u2016\u03b1(u)\u2016S\u2016. (2.2)\nHere \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 denotes the usual operator norm. The most familiar example of a Banach\noperator ideal is B(E,F ) equipped with \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016; this is also the largest operator ideal in the\nsense that, if \u03b1 is an operator ideal norm on an operator ideal A(E,F ) and u \u2208 A(E,F ),\nwe have\n\u2016u\u2016 \u0001 \u03b1(u). (2.3)\nFor more information on operator ideals the reader is directed to [10].\nWe recall from, for example, [10] the definition of a 2-absolutely summing operator.\nFor E and F Banach spaces, the operator T : E \u2192 F is 2-summing if\n\u03c02(T ) = sup\n{\u03bei}i\n(\u2211\ni\n\u2016T\u03bei\u20162F\n)1\/2\n< \u221e, (2.4)\nwhere the supremum is over all finite subsets {\u03bei}i of E satisfying\nsup\n{\u2211\ni\n|\u03be\u2217(\u03bei)|2 : \u03be\u2217 \u2208 E\u2217, \u2016\u03be\u2217\u2016E\u2217 \u0001 1\n}\n\u0001 1. (2.5)\nThe constant \u03c02(T ) is the 2-summing norm of T ; it is an operator ideal norm. We write\n\u03a02(E,F ) for the space of all such T ; it forms a Banach space with norm \u03c02 and so is\na Banach operator ideal. In the case where E and F are both Hilbert spaces, the space\n\u03a02(E,F ) is the space of Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operators from E to F .\nLet E be a complex Banach space and H a complex Hilbert space. Let D(E,H) be a\nBanach space of operators from E to H equipped with a norm \u03b4 satisfying:\n(D1) \u03b4 is an operator ideal norm and D(E,H) is a Banach operator ideal;\n(D2) \u03b4(u) = supP \u03b4(Pu) for all u \u2208 D(E,H), where P is a finite rank orthogonal projec-\ntion on H; and\n(D3) if u \u2208 D(E,H), then\n\u2016u\u2016 \u0001 \u03b4(u) \u0001 \u03c02(u). (2.6)\nIt is straightforward to show that both B(E,H) and \u03a02(E,H) satisfy these properties.\n306 J. S. Groves\nIf \u03b4 is such a norm satisfying (D1)\u2013(D3), we say \u03b4 is 2-convex if\n\u03b4\n(\u2211\nk\nPku\n)2\n\u0001\n\u2211\nk\n\u03b4(Pku)2 (2.7)\nfor all u \u2208 D(E,H) and each finite set of mutually orthogonal projections (Pk) on H. Note\nthat both operator norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 and 2-summing norm \u03c02 are 2-convex; the fact that \u03c02 is\n2-convex is used repeatedly throughout this paper. For more information on 2-convexity\nwe direct the reader to \u00a7 2 of [32].\nType 2 is defined as follows. Let (Xk)k denote a sequence of independent real N(0, 1)\nrandom variables. A Banach space E is of (Gaussian) type 2 if there exists a finite positive\nconstant C such that, for any finite sequence (\u03bek)k in E,\n(\nE\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n\u2211\nk\n\u03bekXk\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n2\nE\n)1\/2\n\u0001 C\n(\u2211\nk\n\u2016\u03bek\u20162E\n)1\/2\n. (2.8)\nWe denote the infimum of all allowable constants C by T2(E), the type 2 constant of E.\nThere are many important examples of type 2 Banach spaces; in particular the Lebesgue\nspaces Lp and the Schatten\u2013von Neumann spaces cp are of type 2 for 2 \u0001 p < \u221e. For\nmore information on the notion of type, and the related notion of cotype, see [10] or [31].\n2.2. A class of weakly measurable random vectors\nIn this discussion (\u2126,F ,P) will be a probability space, E will be a complex Banach\nspace, X will be a function from \u2126 to E, and K will be the collection of all positive\nsesquilinear forms on E \u00d7 E of norm less than or equal to one. We say X : \u2126 \u2192 E is\nweakly (also known as Pettis) measurable if \u03be\u2217X : \u2126 \u2192 C is Borel measurable for all\n\u03be\u2217 \u2208 E\u2217. It is clear that the set of all weakly measurable functions from \u2126 to E forms a\nvector space; this is known as the space of cylindrical random vectors.\nLet L2(\u2126) be the Hilbert space of complex-valued square-integrable functions on\n(\u2126,F ,P), quotiented by functions which are zero almost surely. Denote by L2(\u2126) the\ncorresponding seminormed space of square-integrable functions.\nFor X : \u2126 \u2192 E weakly measurable and K as above we may, following Pisier in [32],\ndefine a seminorm \u03b4K via the formula\n\u03b4K(X) = sup\n\u03d5\u2208K\n(\u222b\n\u2126\n\u03d5(X(\u03c9), X(\u03c9))P(d\u03c9)\n)1\/2\n. (2.9)\nThe only axiom of a seminorm which is unclear is the triangle inequality. However,\nsesquilinearity and the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality enable us to prove [\u03b4K(X1 +X2)]2 \u0001\n[\u03b4K(X1)+ \u03b4K(X2)]2. Denote the seminormed space of all weakly measurable X : \u2126 \u2192 E\nwith \u03b4K(X) < \u221e by L2w(\u2126;E, \u03b4K).\nWe may quotient L2w(\u2126;E, \u03b4K) by the set of all weakly measurable X : \u2126 \u2192 E with\n\u03b4K(X) = 0 to obtain a normed space, which we denote by L2w(\u2126;E, \u03b4K). This space is\nnot, in general, complete; however, we may embed it isometrically in a Banach space of\noperators. The following result follows from Proposition 2.1 of [32].\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in Banach spaces 307\nProposition 2.1. There is an isometric embedding\n\u2227 : L2w(\u2126;E, \u03b4K) \u21aa\u2192 \u03a02(E\u2217, L2(\u2126)) (2.10)\ngiven by the relation\nX\u02c6(\u03be\u2217)(\u03c9) = \u03be\u2217(X(\u03c9)). (2.11)\nProof. Referring to Proposition 2.1 of [32], we see that the relation (2.11) defines an\nisometric embedding \u2227 : L2w(\u2126;E, \u03b4K) \u21aa\u2192 \u03a02(E\u2217,L2(\u2126)) between seminormed spaces.\nWe may quotient by the appropriate null space to obtain an isometric embedding\nbetween normed quotient spaces if, given a random vector X, \u03b4K(X) = 0 implies\n\u03c02(X\u02c6) = 0. But this follows, since \u03b4K(X) = 0 if and only if \u03be\u2217(X) = 0 almost surely, for\nall \u03be\u2217 in E\u2217, which occurs if and only if \u03c02(X\u02c6) = 0. \u0002\nWe shall henceforth use the notation \u03c02 to denote both the \u03b4K norm on L2w(\u2126;E, \u03b4K)\nand the 2-summing norm on \u03a02(E\u2217, L2(\u2126)). The space L2w(\u2126;E, \u03b4K) will now be referred\nto as L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02).\n2.3. The Bochner spaces\nAt times we shall also consider the more usual Bochner Lp spaces. Following [9] we\nsay X : \u2126 \u2192 E is strongly (also known as Bochner) measurable if it is measurable\nwith respect to the Borel \u03c3-algebra on E and takes values almost surely in a separable\nsubspace of E (we say it is almost surely separably valued).\nIf 1 \u0001 p < \u221e and X : \u2126 \u2192 E is a strongly measurable random vector, then its Bochner\nLp norm is given by\n\u2016X\u2016p =\n(\u222b\n\u2126\n\u2016X(\u03c9)\u2016pEP(d\u03c9)\n)1\/p\n. (2.12)\nDenote by Lp(\u2126;E) the set of all strongly measurable X : \u2126 \u2192 E with finite Bochner Lp\nnorm. This is a seminormed vector space whose null space is the subspace of all strongly\nmeasurable X : \u2126 \u2192 E which are zero almost surely. Denote by Lp(\u2126;E) the resulting\nquotient space; this is a Banach space.\nWe may define analogous Lp(\u2126;E) in the cases 0 < p < 1; the resulting spaces are\ncomplete quasinormed spaces.\nNote that if \u03c02 is the weak L2 norm introduced in the last subsection and X lies in\nL2(\u2126;E), then\n\u03c02(X) \u0001 \u2016X\u20162. (2.13)\n2.4. Expectation\nFollowing [9], we say a weakly measurable random vector X : \u2126 \u2192 E is weakly (or\nDunford) integrable if \u03be\u2217X \u2208 L1(\u2126) for all \u03be\u2217 \u2208 E\u2217. This occurs if and only if\nsup\n\u03be\u2217\u2208E\u2217, \u2016\u03be\u2217\u2016\u00011\n\u222b\n\u2126\n|\u03be\u2217X(\u03c9)|P(d\u03c9) < \u221e. (2.14)\n308 J. S. Groves\nFor a weakly integrable X : \u2126 \u2192 E and A \u2208 F we see there exists\u222b\nA\nX(\u03c9)P(d\u03c9) \u2208 E\u2217\u2217 (2.15)\nsuch that (\u222b\nA\nX(\u03c9)P(d\u03c9)\n)\n(\u03be\u2217) =\n\u222b\nA\n\u03be\u2217X(\u03c9)P(d\u03c9) (2.16)\nfor all \u03be\u2217 \u2208 E\u2217. When A = \u2126 we refer to the integral as the weak expectation EX of X\nwith respect to P.\nWe note that if X \u2208 L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02), then, by the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, the above\ncondition holds; thus the weak expectation exists and is finite as an element of E\u2217\u2217.\nIt may be of course that \u222b\nA\nX(\u03c9)P(d\u03c9) \u2208 E (2.17)\nfor all A \u2208 F . In this case, following [9], we say X is Pettis integrable; in particular\nEX \u2208 E.\nFinally, if X lies in the Bochner space L1(\u2126;E), we say, following [9], that it is Bochner\n(or strongly) integrable. Bochner integrability implies Pettis integrability.\nThe following result gives a sufficient condition for a Cauchy sequence in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02)\nto converge in that space; recall that, a priori, we only know that the limit exists as an\noperator in \u03a02(E\u2217, L2(\u2126)).\nProposition 2.2. If (Xn)n\u00021 is a sequence in L2(\u2126;E) which is Cauchy in the \u03c02\nnorm, then the sequence converges in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02).\nProof. Viewing (Xn)n\u00021 as a sequence in the Banach operator ideal \u03a02(E\u2217, L2(\u2126))\nwe see that, as it is a Cauchy sequence in the \u03c02 norm, it must converge in \u03a02(E\u2217, L2(\u2126))\nto a limit operator X\u02c6. By Theorem VIII.1.5 of [9], as (Xn)n\u00021 is a sequence in L2(\u2126;E),\nthe operator X\u02c6 has compact adjoint X\u02c6\u2217 taking values in a separable subspace of E.\nBy Theorem III.2.2 of [9] the compact operator X\u02c6\u2217 : L2(\u2126) \u2192 E is representable, which\nmeans there exists a weakly measurable X : \u2126 \u2192 E satisfying\nX\u02c6\u2217(f) =\n\u222b\n\u2126\nX(\u03c9)f(\u03c9)P(d\u03c9) (2.18)\nfor each f in L2(\u2126). But this X is transparently the limit in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02) of the sequence\n(Xn)n\u00021. \u0002\n2.5. Covariance\nLet E1 and E2 be Banach spaces and let X1 and X2 be elements of L2w(\u2126;E1, \u03c02) and\nL2w(\u2126;E2, \u03c02), respectively. Assume EX1 = EX2 = 0, where expectation is defined in\nthe weak sense; we say X1 and X2 are centred.\nDefine the covariance of X1 and X2, Cov(X1, X2), to be the sesquilinear form on\nE\u22171 \u00d7 E\u22172 given by\nCov(X1, X2)(\u03be\u22171 , \u03be\n\u2217\n2) = E\u03be\n\u2217\n1(X1)\u03be\u22172(X2). (2.19)\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in Banach spaces 309\nThis definition of covariance is used in [26] and [28]. We note by the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz\ninequality that Cov(X1, X2) is bounded as a sesquilinear form.\nFrequently we view Cov(X1, X2) as a linear operator from E\u22172 to E\n\u2217\u2217\n1 ; in fact it is\nthe operator X\u02c6\u22171 X\u02c62, where, as before, X\u02c61 : E\n\u2217\n1 \u2192 L2(\u2126) and X\u02c62 : E\u22172 \u2192 L2(\u2126) are the\noperators associated to X1 and X2. For more information on this subject the reader is\ndirected to Chapter 2 of [15].\nIf E is a Banach space and X is a centred element of L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02), we define the\nvariance of X, Var(X), to be Cov(X,X).\nRemark 2.3. Throughout the rest of this paper we shall, to avoid measure-theoretic\ncomplications (which are expanded on in [15] and [29]), assume all the Banach spaces\nunder consideration are separable. Thus, in particular, strong (Bochner) and weak (Pet-\ntis) notions of measurability coincide. All the random vectors we consider in the rest\nof the paper will be cylindrical; that is to say they will be measurable with respect to\nthe cylindrical \u03c3-algebra on the Banach space, which, as the Banach space is separable,\ncoincides with the Borel \u03c3-algebra.\n3. Gaussian random vectors and Wiener processes\nThis section contains essential preliminary material for \u00a7 4. Background information on\nthe topics covered here may be found in [6], [7], [24] or [26]. We study Gaussian random\nvectors, Wiener processes and stochastic integrals (for continuous deterministic inte-\ngrands) with values in a separable complex Banach space E. We observe that, for all\nE-valued Q-Wiener processes on a probability space (\u2126,F ,P), Q factors through \u00062 with\n2-summing factors.\nFor more general integrands, the theory of stochastic integration in a Banach space\nbecomes rather more involved; see, for example, [2] and [3], in which the theory is devel-\noped for Banach spaces of martingale type 2.\n3.1. Gaussian random vectors\nWe will consider centred Gaussian random vectors taking values in a separable complex\nBanach space E.\nRecall that a complex random variable X is said to be complex centred Gaussian with\nvariance \u03c32 (we say X is complex N(0, \u03c32)) if\nX =\n1\u221a\n2\n(XR + iXI), (3.1)\nwhere XR and XI are independent real N(0, \u03c32) random variables. It is straightforward\nto verify that if (Xk)k is a finite sequence of independent complex centred Gaussian\nrandom vectors on some probability space and (zk)k is a finite sequence in C, then\u2211\nk zkXk is a complex centred Gaussian random vector.\nLet X be an E-valued cylindrical random vector defined on a probability space\n(\u2126,F ,P). Following [26] we say X is centred Gaussian if, for every \u03be\u2217 in E\u2217, \u03be\u2217(X)\nis a complex centred Gaussian random variable.\n310 J. S. Groves\nThe following result is a combination of the Ito\u02c6\u2013Nisio Theorem [19], a result on expo-\nnential integrability of Gaussian random vectors, due independently to Fernique [12] and\nLandau and Shepp [25] and the Karhunen\u2013Loe`ve representation of Gaussian measures\non separable Banach spaces.\nProposition 3.1.\n(a) Let X = (Xk)k\u2208Z be a sequence of independent N(0, \u03c32) complex random vari-\nables on a probability space (\u2126,F ,P) and let (\u03bek)k\u2208Z be a sequence in a separable\ncomplex Banach space E. The following are equivalent.\n(i)\n\u2211\nk\u03bekXk converges almost surely in E.\n(ii)\n\u2211\nk\u03bekXk converges in L\np(\u2126;E) for some (and hence for all) 0 < p < \u221e.\n(iii)\n\u2211\nk\u03bekXk converges in probability.\n(b) If (Yk)k\u00021 is any sequence of cylindrical centred Gaussian random vectors, defined\non (\u2126,F ,P) with values in E, which is Cauchy in the \u03c02 norm, then the sequence\nconverges in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02) to a cylindrical centred Gaussian random vector.\n(c) All cylindrical centred Gaussian random vectors with values in E are equal in\ndistribution to some random vector of the form\n\u2211\nk \u03bekXk, satisfying the equivalent\nconditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of part (a).\nProof. (a) This is the Ito\u02c6\u2013Nisio Theorem; see the original paper [19], or pp. 29\u201336\nof [24], for details.\n(b) We will use the result, due to Fernique [12] and Landau and Shepp [25], that for\nZ any centred Gaussian random vector with values in E, there exists \u03b1 > 0 such that\nE exp{\u03b1\u2016Z\u20162E} < \u221e; (3.2)\nin particular Z lies in L2(\u2126;E).\nIt follows that (Yk)k\u00021 is a sequence in L2(\u2126;E). Proposition 2.2 shows it converges\nin L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02) to a limit Y . We shall show that Y is a centred Gaussian random vector.\nThe definition of the \u03c02 norm shows that, for each \u03be\u2217 in E\u2217, the sequence (\u03be\u2217(Yk))k\u00021\nconverges in L2(\u2126) to \u03be\u2217(Y ). As each \u03be\u2217(Yk) is a complex centred Gaussian random\nvariable, it follows that \u03be\u2217(Y ) is a complex centred Gaussian random variable.\nSince this holds for all \u03be\u2217 in E\u2217, we deduce that Y is a centred Gaussian random\nvector.\n(c) The Karhunen\u2013Loe`ve representation of Gaussian measures, which is Proposition\n2.6.1 of [24] and Proposition 3.6 of [26], now shows that all cylindrical centred Gaussian\nrandom vectors with values in E are equal in distribution to some random vector of the\nform\n\u2211\nk \u03bekXk, satisfying conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) of part (a). \u0002\nProposition 3.1 has the following corollary.\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in Banach spaces 311\nCorollary 3.2. Given a Gaussian random vector\n\u2211\nk \u03bekXk as in Proposition 3.1,\ndefine a map A from the space of those complex sequences (xk)k\u2208Z, such that all but a\nfinite number of the xk are zero, to E by\n(xk)k\u2208Z \u0005\u2192\n\u2211\nk\n\u03bekxk; (3.3)\nthis extends to a bounded operator A : \u00062 \u2192 E with bounded adjoint A\u2217 \u2208 \u03a02(E\u2217, \u00062).\nWrite AX for\n\u2211\nk \u03bekXk; this converges to an almost surely E-valued centred Gaussian\nrandom vector satisfying \u03c02(AX) = \u03c3\u03c02(A\u2217) and Var(AX) = \u03c32AA\u2217.\nProof. Writing AX for\n\u2211\nk \u03bekXk, we know from Proposition 3.1 that AX defines an\nalmost surely E-valued element of L2(\u2126;E). As the \u03c02 norm is weaker than Bochner L2\nnorm, it follows that AX lies in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02); we now apply Proposition 2.1 to observe\nthat the map (\u03be\u2217 \u0005\u2192 \u03be\u2217(AX)) lies in \u03a02(E\u2217, L2(\u2126)). But, for a finite sequence (\u03be\u2217j )j in\nE\u2217,\n\u2211\nj\n\u2016\u03be\u2217j (AX)\u20162L2(\u2126) =\n\u2211\nj\nE\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2211\nk\n\u03be\u2217j (\u03bek)Xk\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n= \u03c32\n\u2211\nj,k\n|\u03be\u2217j (\u03bek)|2\n= \u03c32\n\u2211\nj\n\u2016A\u2217(\u03be\u2217j )\u20162\u00072 , (3.4)\nand so A\u2217 \u2208 \u03a02(E\u2217, \u00062); furthermore, \u03c3\u03c02(A\u2217) = \u03c02(AX). As A\u2217 is bounded it follows\nthat its adjoint A\u2217\u2217 : \u00062 \u2192 E\u2217\u2217 is bounded. We see, however, that A\u2217\u2217 is equal to \u03b9A,\nwhere \u03b9 denotes the isometric embedding of E into E\u2217\u2217. This implies that A is bounded\nfrom \u00062 to E. Finally,\nVar(AX)(\u03be\u22171 , \u03be\n\u2217\n2) = \u03c3\n2\u3008A\u2217(\u03be\u22171), A\u2217(\u03be\u22172)\u3009\u00072 , (3.5)\nyielding Var(AX) = \u03c32AA\u2217 as required. \u0002\nFor definiteness we ensure AX is always E valued by defining AX to be\n\u2211\nk \u03bekXk at\nsample points where this sum converges, and zero on the null set where it diverges.\nIf E is of type 2, we may deduce more.\nCorollary 3.3. Under the additional hypothesis that E is of type 2, the sum AX\nconverges to a centred Gaussian random vector if and only if A\u2217 \u2208 \u03a02(E\u2217, \u00062).\nProof. If AX is centred Gaussian we know from Corollary 3.2 that A\u2217 \u2208 \u03a02(E\u2217, \u00062).\nConversely, let us assume A\u2217 \u2208 \u03a02(E\u2217, \u00062). Then by (0.6) on p. 67 of [32], which is based\non work in [13], we have\n(\nE\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n\u2211\nk\n\u03bekXk\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\n2\nE\n)1\/2\n\u0001 \u03c3T2(E)\u03c02(A\u2217) < \u221e. (3.6)\nWe deduce that AX lies in L2(\u2126;E) and so, by Proposition 3.1, is centred Gaussian. \u0002\n312 J. S. Groves\nCorollary 3.2 enables us to determine, for E a separable complex Banach space, a\nfactorization property for operators Q : E\u2217 \u2192 E\u2217\u2217 which are variances of centred Gaus-\nsian random vectors in E. In the case where E is of type 2, Corollary 3.3 enables us to\ncharacterize such operators Q precisely.\nCorollary 3.4. Let E be a separable complex Banach space.\n(a) Let Q be the variance of some centred Gaussian random vector in E, defined\non some probability space (\u2126,F ,P). Then Q factors as AA\u2217, where the operator\nA : \u00062 \u2192 E has 2-summing adjoint.\n(b) If, furthermore, E is of type 2, then conversely any operator AA\u2217, where A : \u00062 \u2192 E\nhas 2-summing adjoint, is the variance of some centred Gaussian random vector in\nE.\nProof. (a) Let Q = VarZ, where Z is a centred Gaussian random vector in E, defined\non (\u2126,F ,P). By Proposition 3.1 (c) and Corollary 3.2, Z lies in L2(\u2126;E) and is equal\nin distribution to AX, where X is a sequence of independent N(0, 1) complex random\nvariables and A : \u00062 \u2192 E is an operator with 2-summing adjoint. Corollary 3.2 now\nshows Var(AX) = AA\u2217. Thus Q = AA\u2217 as required.\n(b) Taking A as given, by Corollary 3.3 the random vector AX, for X a sequence\nof independent N(0, 1) complex random variables, is a centred Gaussian random vector\nwith variance AA\u2217. \u0002\nIn [36], van Neerven discusses, for E a separable Banach space, which necessary and\nsufficient conditions are needed for an operator E\u2217 \u2192 E\u2217\u2217 to be the variance of a cylin-\ndrical Gaussian measure on E. We see that Corollary 3.4 provides such conditions in\nthe case where E is of type 2. Similar results for type 2 spaces were obtained by Linde,\nTarieladze and C\u02c7obanjan in [27].\n3.2. Wiener processes\nWe now consider E-valued Wiener processes where, as usual, E is a separable complex\nBanach space. Let Q be the variance of some cylindrical centred Gaussian random vector\nin E.\nFollowing [6] or Chapter 5 of [7] we say an E-valued stochastic process (Bt)t\u2208R, defined\non a probability space (\u2126,F ,P), is a Q-Wiener process if\n(i) for each t, Bt is measurable with respect to the cylindrical \u03c3-algebra on E;\n(ii) the process Bt has almost surely continuous sample paths and B0 = 0;\n(iii) the process Bt has independent increments; and\n(iv) for each s < t, Bt \u2212 Bs is a cylindrical centred Gaussian random vector satisfying\nVar(Bt \u2212 Bs) = Q(t \u2212 s). (3.7)\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in Banach spaces 313\nCondition (i) ensures that, for all \u03be\u2217 \u2208 E\u2217, the process \u03be\u2217(Bt) is adapted to the filtration\ninduced on (\u2126,F ,P) by the process Bt.\nProposition 3.1 and Corollaries 3.2 and 3.4 enable us to deduce various properties of\na Q-Wiener process.\nProposition 3.5. Let E be a separable Banach space and let Bt be an E-valued\nQ-Wiener process defined on a probability space (\u2126,F ,P). Let Q factor as AA\u2217, where\nA : \u00062 \u2192 E is some operator with 2-summing adjoint given by Corollary 3.4. For s < t,\n(i) \u03c02(Bt \u2212 Bs) = \u03c02(A\u2217)(t \u2212 s)1\/2; and\n(ii) for T any bounded linear operator on E,\nVar(T (Bt \u2212 Bs)) = TQT \u2217(t \u2212 s). (3.8)\nProof. We observe Bt \u2212 Bs is a cylindrical centred Gaussian random vector satisfying\nVar(Bt \u2212 Bs) = Q(t \u2212 s). Proposition 3.1 (c) and Corollary 3.2 show that Bt \u2212 Bs is\nequal in distribution to a random vector of the form AX(s,t), where, for each s and t,\nX(s,t) = (X(s,t)k )k\u2208Z is a sequence of independent N(0, t\u2212 s) complex random variables.\nCorollary 3.2 now gives the required results immediately. \u0002\nRemark 3.6. Given any such Q we may explicitly construct a Q-Wiener process.\nAssume from Corollary 3.4 that Q factors as AA\u2217. Let bt = (b\n(k)\nt )k\u2208Z be an independent\nsequence of complex Brownian motions on the line, with b(k)0 = 0 for each k, defined on the\ncanonical probability space of continuous paths R \u2192 C equipped with Wiener measure.\nThe Ciesielski representation of Brownian motion, for which see [5] or pp. 10\u201313 of [33],\nallows us to write\nb\n(k)\nt (\u03c9) = lim\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\u2211\nr=0\n\u2211\ns\u2208Z\nfrs(t)Z(k)rs (\u03c9) (3.9)\nfor each k, where the frs are tent-shaped functions of maximum value 2\u2212(r+1)\/2 supported\non [(2s \u2212 2)2\u2212r, (2s)2\u2212r], the Z(k)rs are independent complex N(0, 1) random variables\nand the limit is uniform on compact subsets of R almost surely. Set Zrs = (Z\n(k)\nrs )k\u2208Z. By\napplying the same arguments used to prove the existence of the Ciesielski representation\non pp. 10\u201313 of [33] we may define\nAbt(\u03c9) = lim\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\u2211\nr=0\n\u2211\ns\u2208Z\nfrs(t)AZrs(\u03c9), (3.10)\nwhich may be shown to be a Q-Wiener process.\n3.3. Stochastic integration\nWe wish to develop the theory of stochastic integration of a continuous deterministic\nfamily of operators with respect to a Q-Wiener process. For s < t, let (Tu)s\u0001u\u0001t be a\n314 J. S. Groves\nnon-random family of bounded linear operators on E and let Bt be a Q-Wiener process\nin E. Consider a sequence (Pn)n\u00021 of refining partitions of [s, t]. Thus, if\nPn = {s = u(n)0 < u(n)1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < u(n)r(n)\u22121 < u(n)r(n) = t} (3.11)\nfor each n, we assume that Pn \u2286 Pn+1 for all n and supj(u(n)j+1 \u2212 u(n)j ) \u2193 0 as n tends to\ninfinity. We say the stochastic integral\n\u222b t\ns\nTu dBu (3.12)\nexists as a limit in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02) if the sequence of Riemann sums\nr(n)\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nT\nu\n(n)\nj\n(B\nu\n(n)\nj+1\n\u2212 B\nu\n(n)\nj\n) (3.13)\nconverges to a limit in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02) as n tends to infinity, this limit being independent\nof the choice of partitions (Pn)n\u00021.\nWe have the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.7. For E a separable Banach space, let Bt be an E-valued AA\u2217-Wiener\nprocess defined on a probability space (\u2126,F ,P). Then for s < t, if (Tu)s\u0001u\u0001t is a non-\nrandom family of bounded linear operators on E such that (A\u2217T \u2217u )s\u0001u\u0001t is continuous in\nthe \u03c02 norm, the stochastic integral\n\u222b t\ns\nTu dBu (3.14)\nexists as a limit in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02), defining a centred Gaussian element of L\n2(\u2126;E). Fur-\nthermore,\n\u03c02\n(\u222b t\ns\nTu dBu\n)2\n\u0001\n\u222b t\ns\n\u03c02(A\u2217T \u2217u )\n2 du. (3.15)\nProof. For a partition P = {s = u0 < u1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < ur = t} of the interval [s, t], put\nI(P) =\nr\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nTuj (Buj+1 \u2212 Buj )\n=\nr\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nI(uj , uj+1), (3.16)\nsay. Consider a sequence (Pn)n\u00021 of refining partitions of [s, t]; with the notation of\n(3.11), write\nMn = sup\nj\n(u(n)j+1 \u2212 u(n)j ), (3.17)\nso Mn \u2193 0 as n tends to infinity. Fix n and choose m > n.\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in Banach spaces 315\nTo simplify our notation write uj for u\n(n)\nj , the elements of Pn, and write r for r(n),\nthe number of elements of Pn plus one. As Pm is a refinement of Pn we may write it as\nPm = {s = u0 = u00 < u10 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < uk(0)0 = u1 = u01 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < uk(r\u22121)r\u22121 = ur = t}. (3.18)\nThus\nI(Pm) \u2212 I(Pn) =\nr\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n[k(j)\u22121\u2211\nl=0\nI(ulj , u\nl+1\nj ) \u2212 I(u0j , uk(j)j )\n]\n=\nr\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n[k(j)\u22121\u2211\nl=0\nTulj (Bul+1j \u2212 Bulj ) \u2212 Tu0j (Buk(j)j \u2212 Bu0j )\n]\n=\nr\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n[k(j)\u22121\u2211\nl=0\nTulj (Bul+1j \u2212 Bulj ) \u2212\nk(j)\u22121\u2211\nl=0\nTu0j (Bul+1j \u2212 Bulj )\n]\n=\nr\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nk(j)\u22121\u2211\nl=0\n(Tulj \u2212 Tu0j )(Bul+1j \u2212 Bulj ). (3.19)\nNow the norm \u03c02 is 2-convex; see \u00a7 2 of this paper or \u00a7 2 of [32] for details of this concept.\nThis implies\n\u2016I(Pm) \u2212 I(Pn)\u20162\u03c02 \u0001\nr\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nk(j)\u22121\u2211\nl=0\n\u03c02(A\u2217(T \u2217ulj \u2212 T\n\u2217\nu0j\n))2(ul+1j \u2212 ulj)\n\u0001 sup\n[\u03b1,\u03b2]\u2286[s,t]:\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\u0001Mn\n\u03c02(A\u2217(T \u2217\u03b2 \u2212 T \u2217\u03b1))2(t \u2212 s), (3.20)\nand so, for all m > n,\n\u2016I(Pm) \u2212 I(Pn)\u2016\u03c02 \u0001 sup\n[\u03b1,\u03b2]\u2286[s,t]:\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\u0001Mn\n\u03c02(A\u2217(T \u2217\u03b2 \u2212 T \u2217\u03b1))(t \u2212 s)1\/2. (3.21)\nWe have assumed u \u0005\u2192 A\u2217T \u2217u is continuous in the \u03c02 norm; as [s, t] is compact it follows\nthat u \u0005\u2192 A\u2217T \u2217u is uniformly continuous. Thus, fixing \u03b5 > 0, we may choose N(\u03b5) such\nthat\nsup\n[\u03b1,\u03b2]\u2286[s,t]:\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\u0001Mn\n\u03c02(A\u2217(T \u2217\u03b2 \u2212 T \u2217\u03b1)) < \u03b5 (3.22)\nwhenever n \u0003 N(\u03b5). Hence, for all m > n \u0003 N(\u03b5),\n\u2016I(Pm) \u2212 I(Pn)\u2016\u03c02 < \u03b5(t \u2212 s)1\/2, (3.23)\nwhich shows (I(Pn))n\u00021 is a Cauchy sequence of centred Gaussian random vectors in\nL2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02). By Proposition 3.1 (b) it therefore converges in L\n2\nw(\u2126;E, \u03c02) to a centred\nGaussian random vector. Proposition 3.1 (c) shows that this vector lies in L2(\u2126;E).\nIf (Pn)n\u00021 and (P \u2032n)n\u00021 are any two such sequences of partitions of [s, t], it is clear that\nthe sequence of partitions (Pn \u222a P \u2032n)n\u00021 also yields a convergent sequence of Riemann\n316 J. S. Groves\nsums; furthermore, the limits induced by (Pn)n\u00021, (P \u2032n)n\u00021 and (Pn \u222a P \u2032n)n\u00021 must coin-\ncide. Thus the limit of the sequence (I(Pn))n\u00021 in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02) is independent of the\nchoice of refining partitions. We deduce that the stochastic integral exists as a limit in\nL2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02).\nFinally, by the 2-convexity of the norm \u03c02, if s = u0 < u1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < ur = t is any\npartition of [s, t], we have\n\u03c02\n(r\u22121\u2211\nj=0\nTuj (Buj+1 \u2212 Buj )\n)2\n\u0001\nr\u22121\u2211\nj=0\n\u03c02(A\u2217T \u2217uj )\n2(uj+1 \u2212 uj). (3.24)\nPassing to the limit gives the required result. \u0002\nIn cases where the lower limit is equal to \u2212\u221e and\/or the upper limit is equal to \u221e, we\ndefine the corresponding stochastic integral to be the limit in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02), where this\nexists, of the stochastic integral over [s, t] as s decreases to \u2212\u221e and\/or t increases to \u221e.\nTheorem 3.7 will be used in the next section to prove the existence of a solution to a\nBanach space valued Langevin equation.\n4. Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes\nWe now study a Langevin equation for stochastic processes with values in a separable\ncomplex Banach space E. Background information on diffusion processes may be found\nin [33] or [34]. Information on semigroups of operators on Banach spaces may be found\nin [8] or [17]. General information on infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations\nmay be found in [6] or Chapter 5 of [7].\nIto\u02c6 studied infinite-dimensional Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in the time domain\n(see [18]). More recently, Kolsrud studied Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes from the stand-\npoint of Gaussian random fields in [22], Millet and Smolen\u00b4ski investigated the existence\nand continuity of infinite-dimensional Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in [30], van Neerven\nstudied Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck semigroups in [36] and Brzez\u00b4niak and van Neerven devel-\noped stochastic convolution and applied it to infinite-dimensional Ornstein\u2013Uhlenbeck\nprocesses in [4].\n4.1.

We assume that\n(L2) i\u039b is the generator of a C0 group (eit\u039b)t\u2208R of operators on E; by a corollary to\nthe Hille\u2013Yosida Theorem, for which see \u00a7 12.3 of [17], this is equivalent to the\nresolvent of \u039b satisfying\n\u2016(\u039b+ i\u03c9I)\u2212n\u2016 \u0001 C\u039b\n(|\u03c9| \u2212 \u03b1\u039b)n (4.2)\nfor some finite constants C\u039b > 0 and \u03b1\u039b \u0003 0, all n \u2208 N and all real \u03c9 such that\n|\u03c9| > \u03b1\u039b;\n(L3) the resolvent of \u039b satisfies\n\u2016(\u039b+ i\u03c9I)\u22121\u2016 \u0001 K\u039b (4.3)\nfor some finite constant K\u039b > 0 and all real \u03c9; and\n(L4) i\u039b\u2217 is the generator of a C0 group (eit\u039b\n\u2217\n)t\u2208R of operators on E\u2217 (if E is reflexive,\nthis follows from (L2)).\nFor more information on these conditions, consult [8] or Chapters 11, 12 and 14 of [17].\nNote that (L4), in the presence of (L2), is equivalent to the domain D(\u039b\u2217) of \u039b\u2217, the\nadjoint of \u039b, being norm dense in E\u2217; without (L4) we only know it is weak-\u2217 dense. For\ndetails see \u00a7 1.4 of [8] or Chapter 14 of [17].\nWe interpret equation (4.1) in the following way. The process (Bt)t\u2208R is required to\nbe an E-valued Q-Wiener process. The process (Zt)t\u2208R is required to be an E-valued,\ncentred Gaussian, stationary stochastic process with almost surely Ho\u00a8lder continuous\nsample paths. As Zt is stationary we may write Cov(Zt,Zs) = \u03a8Z(t \u2212 s) for some\nfunction \u03a8Z , called the autocovariance function of the process. Finally, we require that\nBt and Zt satisfy\n\u03be\u2217(Zt \u2212 Zs) +\n\u222b t\ns\n\u039b\u2217(\u03be\u2217)(Zu) du = \u03be\u2217(Bt \u2212 Bs) (4.4)\nalmost surely, for all \u03be\u2217 \u2208 D(\u039b\u2217) and s < t. Following [6] or Chapter 5 of [7] we call the\npair (Bt,Zt) a weak solution of the Langevin equation.\nCondition (L4), together with the separability of E and the Hahn\u2013Banach Theorem,\nimplies there is a countable subset of D(\u039b\u2217) which separates the points of E. This ensures\nthat, if we know \u03be\u2217(Bt) and \u03be\u2217(Zt) almost surely for all \u03be\u2217 \u2208 D(\u039b\u2217), the processes Bt\nand Zt are almost surely determined.\nNote we do not require that Zt be adapted to the filtration induced by Bt; we will,\nhowever, consider important circumstances in which this is the case.\n4.2. Spectral solutions of the Langevin equation\nThis section states and proves an existence theorem for weak solutions of equation (4.1).\nConsider\nZt =\n1\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nei\u03c9t(\u039b+ i\u03c9I)\u22121 dB\u02dc\u03c9, (4.5)\n318 J.

(4.6)\nAll our stochastic integrals will be interpreted within the framework of Theorem 3.7.\nTheorem 4.1. Assume that conditions (L1)\u2013(L4) hold. The expression Zt above\n(a) converges as a stochastic integral for each t \u2208 R, defining an E-valued centred\nGaussian process on (\u2126,F ,P);\n(b) is a stationary process with bounded autocovariance \u03a8Z given by\n\u03a8Z(u) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nei\u03c9u(\u039b+ i\u03c9I)\u22121Q[(\u039b\u00af \u2212 i\u03c9I)\u22121]\u2217 d\u03c9; (4.7)\nand\n(c) has almost surely Ho\u00a8lder continuous sample paths, of exponent \u03b1 for every \u03b1 < 12 .\nThe expression Bt above\n(d) has increments Bt \u2212 Bs which converge as stochastic integrals for each s < t,\ndefining E-valued centred Gaussian random vectors on (\u2126,F ,P); and\n(e) is an E-valued Q-Wiener process defined on (\u2126,F ,P).\nFurthermore,\n(f) the pair (Bt,Zt) is a weak solution of the E-valued Langevin equation (4.1).\nProof. (a) Assume Q factors as AA\u2217. Let us consider, for finite a < b,\nZ\n(a,b)\nt =\n1\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\u222b b\na\nei\u03c9t(\u039b+ i\u03c9I)\u22121 dB\u02dc\u03c9. (4.8)\nBy Theorem 3.7 this expression will converge as a stochastic integral to a centred Gaus-\nsian element of L2(\u2126;E) if the family (A\u2217[ei\u03c9t(\u039b+ i\u03c9I)\u22121]\u2217)a\u0001\u03c9\u0001b is continuous in the\n\u03c02 norm. This in turn will follow if the family (ei\u03c9t(\u039b+ i\u03c9I)\u22121)a\u0001\u03c9\u0001b is operator norm\ncontinuous, since A\u2217 is 2-summing. But, for a \u0001 p < q \u0001 b,\neiqt(\u039b+ iqI)\u22121 \u2212 eipt(\u039b+ ipI)\u22121\n= (eiqt \u2212 eipt)(\u039b+ ipI)\u22121 + eiqt((\u039b+ iqI)\u22121 \u2212 (\u039b+ ipI)\u22121)\n= (eiqt \u2212 eipt)(\u039b+ ipI)\u22121 \u2212 eiqt(q \u2212 p)(\u039b+ ipI)\u22121(\u039b+ iqI)\u22121 (4.9)\nby the resolvent equation. We have |eiqt \u2212 eipt| \u0001 (q \u2212 p)|t|; this and condition (L3) show\nthat\n\u2016eiqt(\u039b+ iqI)\u22121 \u2212 eipt(\u039b+ ipI)\u22121\u2016 \u0001 K\u039b(|t| +K\u039b)(q \u2212 p), (4.10)\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in Banach spaces 319\nwhich proves that (ei\u03c9t(\u039b+ i\u03c9I)\u22121)a\u0001\u03c9\u0001b is continuous, indeed Ho\u00a8lder continuous, in\noperator norm, as required. We deduce that Z(a,b)t defines a centred Gaussian element\nof L2(\u2126;E).\nBy Proposition 3.1 (b) the integral Z(a,b)t will converge in L2w(\u2126;E, \u03c02) as a \u2193 \u2212\u221e and\nb \u2191 \u221e if, for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a positive finite N(\u03b5) such that \u2016Z(m,n)t \u2016\u03c02 < \u03b5 for\nall n > m \u0003 N(\u03b5).

A sufficient condition for adaptedness and uniqueness\nWe now consider a condition on \u039b under which Zt is adapted to the filtration induced\nby Bt, and Zt is unique in distribution. The following corollary to Theorem 4.1 mirrors\nresults in Ito\u02c6\u2019s paper [18].\nCorollary 4.2. Let (Bt,Zt) be a weak solution of the E-valued Langevin equa-\ntion (4.1). Assume, as well as (L1)\u2013(L4), that the operator (\u2212\u039b) generates a C0 semigroup\n(e\u2212\u039bt)t\u00020 of exponential norm decay. Then the process Zt is adapted to the filtration\ninduced by Bt; furthermore, if (B\u2032t,Z\n\u2032\nt) is also a weak solution, then Z\n\u2032\nt is identical in\ndistribution to Zt.\nProof. Firstly let (Bt,Zt) and (Bt,Z \u2032t) be weak solutions of the E-valued Langevin\nequation. Setting \u0398t = Z \u2032t \u2212 Zt we see that \u0398t is an E-valued, centred Gaussian, sta-\ntionary stochastic process with almost surely Ho\u00a8lder continuous sample paths defined on\n(\u2126,F ,P) which satisfies\n\u03be\u2217(\u0398t \u2212 \u0398s) +\n\u222b t\ns\n\u039b\u2217(\u03be\u2217)(\u0398u) du = 0 (4.26)\nalmost surely, for all \u03be\u2217 \u2208 D(\u039b\u2217) and s < t. Ito\u02c6\u2019s paper [18] now shows, for s < t,\n\u0398t = e\u2212\u039b(t\u2212s)\u0398s. (4.27)\nThe condition that (e\u2212\u039bt)t\u00020 is of exponential norm decay, together with the requirement\nthat \u0398t be stationary, now implies \u0398t = 0 almost surely, we simply let t tend to infinity\nin (4.27).\nOrnstein\u2013Uhlenbeck processes in Banach spaces 323\nNow, by [18], if Bt is any E-valued Q-Wiener process, then the process\nZt =\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212\u039b(t\u2212u) dBu (4.28)\nis such that (Bt,Zt) is a weak solution of the E-valued Langevin equation.\nCombining these results we see that, given Bt, the process Zt is almost surely unique\nand is given almost surely by the stochastic integral (4.28).\nThe stochastic integral (4.28) shows that Zt is adapted to the filtration induced by Bt.\nFurthermore, we see that, whenever (Bt,Zt) and (B\u2032t,Z\n\u2032\nt) are weak solutions, Zt must\nbe expressible almost surely in the form (4.28) as a stochastic integral with respect to\nBt, and Z \u2032t must be expressible almost surely in the form (4.28) as a stochastic integral\nwith respect to B\u2032t. We deduce, as Bt and B\n\u2032\nt have the same distribution, that Zt and\nZ \u2032t have the same distribution. \u0002\nRemark 4.3. We pose two questions. Under what precise conditions is the Ornstein\u2013\nUhlenbeck process Zt unique in distribution? Under what precise conditions is Zt adapted\nto the filtration induced by the Q-Wiener process Bt? Corollary 4.2 provides a sufficient\ncondition for both adaptedness and uniqueness.\n4.4. Examples\nLet 1 < p < \u221e and \u03b5 > 0. Define\nE = {f \u2208 Lp(R) : f\u02c6(\u03b6) = 0 for all |\u03b6| \u0001 \u03b5}, (4.29)\nwhere f\u02c6 denotes the Fourier transform of f . The continuity of the Riesz projection on\nLp(R) [23, Section V.B] shows that E is a closed complemented subspace of Lp(R); it is\ntherefore a reflexive Banach space.\nWe consider various possibilities for \u039b, each defined via Fourier multipliers.\n(i) (\u0302eit\u039bf)(\u03b6) = eit\u03b6 f\u02c6(\u03b6), so (eit\u039bf)(x) = f(x + t) for all x \u2208 R and (eit\u039b)t\u2208R is a C0\ngroup of translation operators on Lp(R) with \u039b = \u2212i(d\/dx).\n(ii) (\u0302eit\u039bf)(\u03b6) = eit|\u03b6|f\u02c6(\u03b6), so (eit\u039bf)(x) = (R+f)(x+ t) + (R\u2212f)(x \u2212 t) for all x \u2208 R,\nwhere R+ and R\u2212 denote the positive and negative Riesz projections.\n(iii) (\u0302eit\u039bf)(\u03b6) = eit log |\u03b6|f\u02c6(\u03b6), implying eit\u039b = \u2206it, where \u2206 = \u2212d2\/dx2 is the Laplace\noperator. The Laplacian is essentially self-adjoint on C\u221ec (R) (see Chapter 4 of [8]\nfor details), which enables us to define its imaginary powers by Fourier multipli-\ners as described. These imaginary powers (\u2206it)t\u2208R form a C0 group on Lp(R) of\npolynomial growth (see [16] for details).\nAll the (eit\u039b)t\u2208R considered here restrict to E, yielding C0 groups. The condition on\neach f in E that f\u02c6(\u03b6) = 0 for all |\u03b6| \u0001 \u03b5 implies, in all cases, that the resolvent of \u039b is\nbounded on the imaginary axis; conditions (L2)\u2013(L4) are therefore satisfied. In addition,\nneither \u039b nor (\u2212\u039b) generate C0 semigroups of exponential norm decay.\n324 J. S. Groves\nThus, given any such \u039b and any Q which is the variance of some centred Gaussian\nrandom vector in E, the E-valued Langevin equation (4.1) associated to \u039b and Q has a\nweak solution as described in Theorem 4.1.\nAcknowledgements.
