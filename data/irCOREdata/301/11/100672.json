Marko, A.D. Andreev, A.R. Adams, R. Krebs, \nJ.P. Reithmaier and A. Forchel \nIt has been found that Auger recombination is ve ly  important in \nI .3 pm quantum dot (QD) lasers at room temperalure and is  the cause \nof the IOW charactenstic tcmperamre, while in the 9RO nm QD lvsers \nradiative recombination dominatcr. \nInrroduction: Over the past 20 years there have been considerable \nefforts to reduce the cffcctivc dimensionality o f  thc active regions o f  \nsemiconductor lasers. Improving technology has allowed the succes- \nsive fabrication o f  hulk, quantum wcII, quantum wire and finally, \nquantum dot lasers [I ] .  The main driving reason has been the control \nof the electron density o f  states that quantum confinement pravidcs, \nallowing injected electrons and holes to  b e  ever more restricted to \nthose energies where they c m  take part in the stimulated emission \nprocess. This results, far cxamplc, in thc prediction that if the \nelectrons can be confined to  a single discrete atomic like level in \nquantum dot (QD) lascrs, they will not suffcr thcrmal broadening and \nthe threshold current will be temperature insensitive [ 2 ] .  However, \ndespite the growth of very good self-assembled layers of quantum \ndots. the longer wavelength lasers required for optical communication \nremain stubbornly temperature sensitive [ I ,  31. In this Letter we \nshow, from studies of the temperature and pressure dependence o f  \nthe characteristics o f  9x0 nm and 1.3 pm Q D  lasers, that the radiative \nrecombination currcnt is indced tcmpcrature insensitive. However, \nthe total threshold current o f  the 1.3 pm lasers remains very tempera- \nture dependent due to strong Auger recombination processes as \nobserved in quantum well and bulk 1.3 pm devices [4, 51. This \nimplies that even if perfectly uniform arrays o f  quantum dots can \nbe produce9 Q D  lasers will remain temwrature sensitive unless the \nAuger process can also be eliminated. \nResults and discussion: The 1.3 pm quantum dot lasers investigated \nwere broad area GRINSCH structures with six stacked layers o f  InAs \nQDs within Ga,>.sslnc, ,As quantum wells separated by 40 nm GaAs \nbarriers. The width of the top stripe contact was 100 pm. The active \nregion o f  980 n m  QO lasers was formed by either one or two layers of \nlnAs QDs separated by a 30  nm GaAs spacer. Far both wavelengths \nthe active regions were embedded between AIo 4Gau.60As cladding \nlayers and an AlGaAs waveguide with the  AI composition graded \nbetween 15 and 30%. The facets were as-cleaved and the cavity length \nwas 1-2 mm. \nBoth unamplified spontaneous emission from a window milled in the \nsubstrate contact and emission from the laser facet wcrc invcstigatcd \nagainst injected current at different temperatures. Details of this \ntechnique were described elsewhcrc [4, 61. Fig. la shows the tempera- \nmre variation of the radiative p a n  of the threshold current which \nwas determined from the integrated spontaneous emission intensity at \nthe threshold current [4, 61. As can be seen, lrvd is almost independent \nof temperature as expected for ideal quantum dot lasers However, \nFig. Ib shows that the total threshold current, IIh, is ver)i sensitive to \ntemperature in the I .3  pm devices, indicating the presence o f  a strongly \ntemperature-sensitive non-radiative path. This is reflected in the \ndecreasing radiative efficiency (measured as integrated spontaneous \nemission at constant current below f,~,), vmm plotted in Fig. lo. The \neffect is not due to thermal excitation out o f t h e  dot, since the variation \nis strongest in the I .3 pm devices where the dots are deepest. Also, no \nspontaneous emission was observed from the wening or adjacent layers. \nThe quantum differential efficiency above threshold was independent of \ntemperature, showing that the rffrct of i n t e r d e n c c  band absorption is \nnegligible. \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \na \nTO=% K \/\/ \n0 O \/  \nT,=260-280 K \n260 225 250 275 300 \ntemperature.

This allowed E,,,. to be \nvaned whilc keeping all other basic properties of the structure effec- \ntively unchanged.

For the 980 nm Q D  lasers, 18,, increases with pressure \nproportional to the square of the photon energy as expected from a \nsimple analytical model of a laser with only radiative recombination. \nHowever, as shown in Fig. 2, the threshold current of the 1.3 p m  Q D  \nlaser decreases by 26% over a I2 kbar. This may he compared with the \nresults far 1.3 pm GaInAsP quantum well lasers where the threshold \ncurrent decreases by about 10% in the same pressure interval due to a \nstrong Auger recombination contribution of about 50% lo the total \nthreshold current [4, 51. \n58 ELECTRONlCS LETTERS 9th January 2003 Vo\/. 39 No. 7 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The calculations take full account o f  strain \nand piezoclcctic fields in QDs. The calculations were performed in the \nframework of  an 8 x 8 k.p model using the plane-wave expansion \nmethod. For calculations of the radiative current density we used an \nequilibrium distibution ofcanicrs in thc Q D  struchm, which is valid at \nhigh temperatures. T>250  K. Thc calculatcd radiative current density \nat zero prcssurc and 300 K is 150 A\/cm' which accounts for only 24% \nof the total threshold current measured. To analyse the pressure \ndependence of the thrcshold currcnt wc used a simple analytical \nmodel and estimatcd that the radiative and Auger currents, llnd \nand I,,,,,, depend on the photon lasing energy E,,., as l,,dn ( E d  and \nIaugn(&j*, with 1=2, as observed for the 980nm lasers, \nand m = - 1 I12 by analogy with quanhm wel l  lasers. We also assumed \nthat the pressure dependence of these two current paths comes through \nthe pressure dependence of E,&p), which is measured. We then fitted \nthe measured pressure dependence of the threshold currcnt with the \nsimple formula M i J ! \/ 1 d O =  ( L d + l u f , z ! \/ M O j  = x I E d p ! \/  \nE!,(Oj]'+ (1 -1j[E!~~,(p) \/E~, , (0)]~ with fining paramctcr x =  l,cdO)\/ \nb ( 0 )  as the fraction of the radiative current at zero pressurc (sce Fig. 2). \nHence we estimated that at zero pressurc and 300K the Auger \ncontfibution I,, to the total thrcshold current is 7051 and the radiative \ncontribution lrUi, is 30\"\/, which is in excellent agreement with our direct \ncalculations o f  I,,,,. We also note that any combination of I between I \nand 3 and m behveen -3 and -8, leads to an Auger conhibution lo, \nwhich is larger than 58%. Thus, the calculations and the analysis o f  \nhigh-pressure measurements allow us to conclude that Augcr recombi- \nnation in QDs is the most likely reason for thc high temperahre \nsensitivity of the I . 3  p m  Q D  Iascrs, whilc in thc 980 nm Q D  laser \nradiative recombination dominates. \nConclusion: We have shown that while the radiative current in both \n1.3 pm and 980 nm wavelength quantum dot lasers is indeed tempera- \nture insensitive, the total threshold current in the longer wavelength \ndevices is dominated by the temperature sensitivity of a large Auger \nrecombination current, just as seen in bulk and quantum well devices \noperating at 1.3 pm. Indeed, Auger recombination appears to be \nlargest of all in quantum dot devices. This implies that, even if \nperfectly uniform arrays of q u a n h m  dots can be produccd, Q D  \nlasers will remain temperature sensitive unless thc Auger processes \ncan he eliminated. Detailed calculations of Auger rates in QDs are \nnow in progress. \n9 October 2002 0 IEE 2003 \nElectronics Letters Online No: 20030014 \nDO\/: \/0.104Y\/e1;20030014 \nI.P. Marka, A.D. Andrew, A.R.

It is critical that LW- \nVCSELs obtain single transverse-mode operation and a small far- \nficld angle for efficient coupling into singlemade fibre. Monolithic \nVCSEL designs without external pumping are also highly preferable \nin order to increase manufacturability and cast-cffectiveness. \nSeveral monolithic LW-VCSEL approaches have yielded results far \nsinglemode 1.55 pm operation including regrowth methods [I], meta- \nmorphic g r o w h  121, GaAsSb [3] and wafer-fusion 14-61, Karim et al. \n[4] reported an output power of 0.65 m W  at 20\u00b0C with no mention of \nthe sidemode suppression ratio (SMSRj.
