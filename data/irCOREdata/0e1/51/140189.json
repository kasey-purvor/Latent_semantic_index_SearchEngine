We found a tension between\ninstitutional pressures at the inter- and intra-firm levels, an emergence of innovative practices\nand new routines at inter-organizational level, and an evolution over time that could involve a\nde-institutionalisation of the relationship as a result of internal priorities competing with the\nresource requirements of the supply relationship.\nOriginality\/Value: we address the interface between OM and organisational theory. We\npropose areas where institutionalisation of a supply relationship can be strengthened or\nweakened. Our findings further challenge the view of supply relationships as a \u2018spectrum\u2019 in\nwhich progress is unidirectional over time.\nPaper Type: Empirical research paper\nKeywords: Buyer-supplier relationships, reciprocal interdependence, institutional theory, HR\npractices, case study\nINTRODUCTION\nSupply relationships today are often under pressure as a result of calls for defect reduction,\nfor coping with variable demand, for innovation (and thus short product life cycles), for more\nknowledge-intensive products, and for continuous price reduction. One way to address these\ngrowing environmental pressures is to intensify efforts for inter-organisational collaboration.\nFor example, supply base restructuring leads to fewer direct suppliers - with whom a focal\nfirm can develop broader, closer relationships. A new, widely-shared logic has emerged - that\nthere is benefit to be gained by changing the nature of supply relationships by engaging in\nsuch developments as partnerships, alliances and contracting out. Many firms now take it for\ngranted that this is an approved \u2018modern\u2019 managerial practice. This is evidenced by an\nemerging OM literature that discusses supply relationships in terms of integration \u2013 for\nexample, Frohlich and Westbrook (2001), and Cousins and Menguc (2006).\nThese trends encourage firms to develop more interdependent supply relationships\ncharacterised by increased use of obligational contracting (Cousins and Crone, 2003). A\n\u2018spectrum\u2019 from arm\u2019s length to obligational (Sako, 1992, Speckman, 1998, Humphries et al\n2007) is often proposed, suggesting that development is unidirectional, homogeneous (each\n2stage has distinct characteristics that are not shared by others) and progressive (each stage is\nan advance on its predecessor - and leads to a fully collaborative, ideal destination).\nHowever, recent research suggests that none of these characteristics of the \u2018spectrum\u2019 need\napply. While the \u2018spectrum\u2019 may be a useful idea, Cousins and Crome (2003) ask \u2018what\nhappens when you reach the end of the line?\u2019 Even in a reciprocally interdependent supply\nrelationship, we found evidence of \u2018separatism\u2019 - a tendency to give higher priority to internal\nneeds than to supply partner needs (Koulikoff-Souviron and Harrison, 2006, 2007). Other\nauthors have emphasised the need to address the dynamic nature of supply relationships by\nunderstanding how they unfold over time (Stuart and McCutcheon, 1996).\nIn order to probe the often complex and messy nature of supply relationships, it is\nincreasingly necessary to use concepts that were derived from outside OM. Amundson\n(1998: 341) argues that there is a dearth of theories relative to other fields: by learning from\nother disciplines, OM can \u2018exercise prudence without painfully reinventing the wheel\u2019. For\nexample, Ireland and Webb (2007) have drawn on social capital theory, resource dependency\ntheory and transaction cost theory (TCT) to study trust and power in supply chains, whilst\nZhao et al (2007) studied the same two constructs through TCT and social exchange theory.\nA common perspective is that borrowing theories from other fields contributes to enriching\nand broadening OM as a discipline. We sought a theory that would help explain the temporal\nconnections which we had observed during the evolution of supply relationships, and which\ndid not propose some idealised, distinct destination.\nA theory that is showing promise in both respects is institutional theory (Scott, 1995, 2001).\nUsing this approach to probe a supplier development programme, Rogers et al (2006: 569-\n570) conclude that \u2018arguments from institutional theory can contribute to a better\nunderstanding of the social context of OM and supply chain management strategies\u2019. At the\nsame time, it is possible to contribute to institutional theory - which has focused mostly on\n\u2018the firm level of analysis\u2019- in return. Sila (2007) used institutional and contingency theory\nto probe TQM implementation, and concluded that organisational theory \u2013 while rarely used\n\u2013 was valuable in differentiating between universal prescription and context-dependency.\nSeveral researchers had earlier chosen to use institutional theory in order to throw light on\nOM issues in supply relationships (Hunter, 1996; Scarbrough, 2000), and in inter-\norganisational relations (Marchington and Vincent, 2004). We describe the elements of\ninstitutional theory in the next section.\nOur earlier paper (Koulikoff-Souviron and Harrison, 2007) connected HR and OM issues in\ninterdependent supply relationships by focusing on the issues of adaptation and the influence\nof internal HR practices on the relationship. We had thus recognised that there were temporal\nconnections, but had not attempted to analyse them systematically. This paper re-analyses the\ncase in our earlier paper by exploring the role of HR practices within an interdependent\nsupply relationship using Scott\u2019s view of institutions as composed of \u2018cultural-cognitive,\nnormative, and regulative elements that - together with associated activities and resources -\nprovide stability and meaning to social life\u2019 (2001: 48). Our study views supply relationships\nas institutions that comprise a \u2018community of organisations that partakes of a common\nmeaning system\u2019 (2001: 84). Hence, in contrast with other authors who have focused on\ndiffusion of practices (Hunter, 1996; DiMaggio and Powell, 1983), or the influence of the\nenvironment on internal practices (Marchington, 2004; Rogers et al, 2006), this study\ninvestigates the role of HR practices in the construction and maintenance - and possible decay\n- of a reciprocally interdependent supply relationship. Our paper has two objectives:\n1) to investigate in what ways HR practices contribute to the institutionalisation of the supply\nrelationship by acting as carriers for regulative, normative and cognitive processes and\n32) to use institutional theory as a lens for understanding the evolution of a supply relationship\nover time.\nWe have organised our paper into five further sections. First, we develop Scott\u2019s (1995,\n2001) institutional view as a framework for studying HR practices in interdependent supply\nrelationships; second we explain how institutional theory can contribute to OM; third we\npresent our research methodology; fourth we present our findings on the role of HR practices;\nfinally we present our discussion of the findings and our conclusions.\nInstitutional theory and supply relationships\nAs is apparent from our summary above, institutional theory has been sparsely used in OM,\nyet common themes can be found. Berger & Luckman (1966, p. 82) conceive institutions as\nde facto integrated, relying on primary social control and manifesting themselves in\ncollectivities containing considerable numbers of people (ibid, p. 73). Such characteristics\necho the OM concerns with the integration of long term, strategic supply relationships\n(Frohlich and Westbrook, 2001) across multiple channels of interaction (Marchington &\nVincent, 2004).\nScott (2001) describes institutions in terms of \u2018three pillars\u2019 - regulative, normative and\ncultural-cognitive. Characteristics of the three pillars are summarised in table 1 (ibid, p. 52):\nTable 1: Scott\u2019s Three Pillars of Institutions\nRegulative Normative Cultural-Cognitive\nBasis of\nCompliance\nExpedience Social obligation Taken-for-grantedness\nShared understanding\nBasis of order Regulative rules Binding expectations Constitutive schema\nMechanisms Coercive Normative Mimetic\nLogic Instrumentality Appropriateness Orthodoxy\nIndicators Rules\nLaws\nSanctions\nCertification\nAccreditation\nCommon beliefs\nShared logics of action\nBasis of\nlegitimacy\nLegally\nsanctioned\nMorally governed Comprehensible\nRecognisable\nCulturally supported\nWhile the regulative pillar refers explicitly to the use of monitoring and sanctioning as ways\nof influencing future behaviour, the normative element imposes constraints on social\nbehaviour through norms and values. This element is closely associated with processes of\nsocialisation, which \u2013 in an inter-organisational context - Cousins et al (2006) regard as\n\u2018creating relational value in supply chains\u2019. The cultural-cognitive pillar refers to the\nconstruction and ongoing transformation of common frames of meaning through a repeated\nprocess of interaction. Scott argues that the three pillars may be viewed as contributing to the\ninstitutionalisation process in interdependent and mutually reinforcing ways. While much\ncan be learned from the pillars separately, in practice they reinforce each other and become\ninterdependent.\nScarbrough (2000, p. 6-7) proposes that Scott\u2019s institutional view be adopted to characterize\nand study relationships in the supply chain:\n4Patterns of interaction, expectations and roles are established which are not explicable\nin terms of the choices made by individual firms. As a result, supply chain effects look\n\u2026 like an institutional innovation, producing stability and meaning through novel\nstructures and activities\u2026 This view links the development of the supply chain to the\ncreation of new cognitive, normative and regulative structures at an inter-\norganisational level.\nInterdependent supply relationships follow the pattern of institutions in that they are \u2018multi-\nfaceted, durable social structures, made up of symbolic elements, social activities and\nmaterial resources\u2019 (Scott, 2001, p. 49). A characteristic of such relationships is their relative\nstability (long term relationships), although they are subject to change processes. Our study\nfollowed Scott\u2019s view of \u2018institutionalisation as a process, as the growth (or decline) over\ntime of cultural-cognitive, normative, or regulative elements capable, to varying degrees, of\nproviding meaning and stability to social behaviour\u2019 (2001, p. 92). The possible erosion or\nrejection of institutionalisation processes over time is highlighted by Oliver (1992): these\nprocesses are by no means unidirectional in nature. Decline can occur because of failure to\naccept \u2018what was once a shared understanding of legitimate organisational conduct or by a\ndiscontinuity in the willingness or ability of organisations to take for granted and continually\nre-create an institutionalised organisational activity\u2019. We were keen to explore this aspect of\ninstitutional theory, because it reflects our earlier findings that supply relationships are also\nneither homogenous nor progressive.\nScott argues that institutions are embedded in various repositories or carriers. There is a\nchoice of carriers that may contribute to the institutionalisation of supply relationships. We\ninvestigate the effects of HR practices as carriers from both partner organisations at an inter-\norganisational level. We seek to describe to what extent HR practices contribute to a view of\nthe supply relationship as an \u2018entity, as a cultural or social system characterised by one or\nmore features or properties\u2019 (Scott, 2001, p. 92). Thus we explore in what ways HR practices\nmay act as carriers for regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive pillars. Our first research\nquestion is how do HR practices contribute to the institutionalisation of a supply\nrelationship?\nInstitutional theory contribution to OM\nA central tenet of OM theory on inter-firm relationships - whether it is based on TCT (Grover\nand Malhotra, 2003; Williamson 1985, 1996) or on arm\u2019s length v obligational contracting\n(Sako, 1992; Lamming, 1995) - is that firms need to \u2018choose the most appropriate methods\nfor managing supply relationships\u2019 (Cousins and Crone, 2003, p. 1448). This view depicts\ninter-organisational relationships on a continuum from arm\u2019s length to collaborative\ncontracting. But the continuum tends to be reduced to a view of relationships as polar\nopposites that are entirely cooperative or entirely competitive (Klein et al., 2007).\nThe polarised view fails to depict the reality of the buyer-supplier integration process - as\nstated by Cousins and Menguc (2006, p. 617):\nOur findings show a gap in the logic of the literature, which is that the assumption is\nthat integration is either 1 or 0, i.e. you either have it or you do not. It would appear\nfrom our findings that it has much more of a staged effect.\nOther authors have contributed to a richer picture of integration as composed of a mix of\npower and trust (Ireland and Webb, 2007; Zhao et al, 2007).\nScott\u2019s institutional framework does not attempt to categorise relationships in terms of a\nspectrum - but provides a framework that can be used to analyse relationships in terms of the\n5\u2018three pillars\u2019. We argue that the institutional view offers the potential for developing this\nricher picture of integration by encouraging the study of the mix of elements that comprise\nboth arm\u2019s length and collaborative poles.\nSeveral authors have recognised that a mix of elements is at work, and we can propose how\ntheir ideas fit with institutional theory. Table 2 shows a correspondence between the\ninstitutional theory framework and concepts important in OM.\nTable 2 Correspondence between institutional theory and OM Concepts\nInstitutional\ntheory concepts\nOperations management concepts\nRegulative - Power as integration mechanism; coercive power and punishment;\njustice and authority (Ireland and Webb, 2007; Zhao et al, 2007);\ncoordination by standardisation (Crook and Combs, 2007)\n- Contracts and enforcement (Sako, 1992)\n- Authoritative management style, power culture help implementation\nphase of performance measurement (Bititci et al, 2006)\n- Calculative view of trust (Cousins and Crone, 2003)\n- Knowledge flow is highly explicit, fast (Nissen, 2007)\nNormative - Information sharing and integration (Holweg and Pil, 2007)\n- Trust and commitment as integration mechanisms (Sako, 1992;\nIreland and Webb, 2007; Zhao et al, 2007)\n- Shared values (Spekman, 1998) and identity (Ireland and Webb,\n2006)\n- Coordination by planning and scheduling (Crook and Combs, 2007)\n- Socialisation (Cousins and Menjuc, 2006)\n- Value or norm based view of trust (Cousins and Crone, 2003)\n- Relational practices to cope with reduced supply base (Gonz\u00e1lez-\nBenito, 2002)\nCultural-\ncognitive\n- Problem solving and knowledge exchange (Cousins and Menjuc,\n2006)\n- Knowledge flow is highly tacit, very slow (Nissen, 2007)\n- Coordination by mutual adjustment, relational gains shared (Crook\nand Combs, 2007)\n- Culture of competitiveness (Hult et al, 2007)\n- \u2018Habitual (ongoing) phase\u2019 of performance measurement benefits\nfrom laissez faire, participative management (Bititci, 2006)\n- Cognitive-based view of trust (Cousins and Crone, 2003)\nWe argue that institutional theory provides a useful framework to encompass the multifaceted\nperspectives of different OM concepts - the three pillars are considered to be mutually\nreinforcing (Scott, 2001). Here are some examples:\n\uf0b7 Cousins and Crone (2003) discuss trust in terms of calculative (regulative), normative and\ncognitive views - which fits nicely with the mutually reinforcing \u2018pillars\u2019 of the\ninstitutional framework.\n\uf0b7 Crook and Combs (2007) relate use of bargaining power by stronger members in supply\nrelationships to Thompson\u2019s (1967) task interdependencies - highest in pooled, lowest in\nreciprocal.\n6\uf0b7 Ireland and Webb (2006) provide a rich picture of the inter-relationships and mutual\nreinforcement between justice and authority (regulative pillar) and identity and boundary\nspanning (normative and cultural-cognitive pillars).\n\uf0b7 Zhao et al (2007) distinguish the coercive and reward power types from the relational\ntype, which draws on expert or legitimate power.\nThere have been calls in the OM literature for a more dynamic perspective on supply\nrelationships. Supply chain integration is very different at an early or a later stage (Ring and\nVan de Ven, 1994; Stuart and McCutcheon, 1996). This means that a life cycle approach may\nbe useful to depict the evolution processes that take place over time (Spekman et al, 1998).\nThe institutional view (Scott, 1995, 2001) explains the creation, maintenance and possible\ndecay of institutions. Over time, it describes the emergence and transformation of specific\ngovernance mechanisms (regulative), coupled with a rise of moral imperatives (normative)\nand of a shared understanding (cultural-cognitive). Although the concept of institutions\nimplies stability, this does not preclude that \u2018things \u2013 structures, rules, routines \u2013 (may) fall\napart\u2019 (Scott, 2001: 110). This can involve de-institutionalisation - the processes by which\ninstitutions weaken and disappear (ibid, p. 182). Stuart and Mc Cutcheon (1996) argue for a\ndynamic rather than static view of supply relationships. So our second research question is\nhow does institutional theory explain the evolution of a supply relationship over time?\nMETHODS\nCase studies can be used for different types of research purposes, including theory building,\nwhich identify and describe key variables and their linkages, and theory testing. Voss et al\n(2002: 201) argue that research questions may evolve over time with a change of focus from\ntheory building to theory testing. Our study reflects such an evolution. It draws on the\nWheatco-Chemco case study, whose initial focus described in Koulikoff-Souviron and\nHarrison (2007) was exploration and inductive theory building. This paper analyses the same\nqualitative dataset, using a deductive approach in order to test the relevance and explanatory\npower of institutional theory constructs (see table 1) in supply relationships. Amundson\n(1998) argues that the use of a different theoretical lens can \u2018cause identical situations to be\nviewed differently, suggesting different course of actions for observers\u2019 (p. 347) and provide a\ndifferent interpretation of the same situation. This form of theoretical triangulation (Jick,\n1979; Yin, 2003) helps avoid potential blind spots linked to the theoretical lens.\nAs described in our earlier paper, the case involved a closed-loop supply relationship between\ntwo industrial partners, who were both customer of and supplier to each other. Our unit of\nanalysis was the relationship (the inter-firm level), rather than the single organisation. We\nselected the dyad because of the highly interdependent nature of the supply relationship,\ndetails of which are provided in the next section. A feature of the research design was 48\nsemi-structured interviews (from 36 informants) with a wide cross-section of employees and\nmanagers from both sides of the dyad. The aim was to collect data, which was \u2018pluralist\u2019 in\nnature, hence providing competing versions of reality (Pettigrew, 1990). The researcher\nshould \u2018be seeking multiple viewpoints, particularly where there is likely to be subjectivity\nand bias\u2019 (Voss et al, 2002). We sought to collect data on the perspectives of informants at\ndifferent but complementary levels in both institutions. These levels included operators,\nprocess engineers, local and corporate management.\nThe length and protocol for conducting interviews evolved over the course of our research. To\nbegin with, interviews tended to be relatively informal and lasted from 1 to 3 hours. These\n7introductory interviews were aimed at providing an in-depth understanding of the research\ncontext. At a later stage, interviews were more focused and structured, and were aimed at\nproviding specific additional evidence, or to verify earlier research findings (Pitman and\nMaxwell, 1992). Dealing with time in the course of this research required taking into account\nthe historical perspective (see next section) and accounting for the change process that took\nplace over the period of the research. This involved interviewing the same people throughout\nthe research or at the beginning and at the end of the research to be able to capture how their\nview of the relationship evolved over time.\nThe study drew on other sources of evidence, such as documentation and observation. Some\ndocuments - such as joint meeting minutes, contract agreements, job descriptions and HR\nprocedures - were directly relevant. Others, such as company brochures and organisation\ncharts, pertained to the context at company or site level. As a complement to real-time data\ncollection, historical data was also collected, using triangulation of methods and sources in\norder to carefully cross-check the chronology of the process.\nTHE WHEATCO - CHEMCO RELATIONSHIP\nWheatco and Chemco are two US chemical corporations, both leaders in their fields and with\nsimilar sales (around $2bn). Eight years prior to our study, the two companies formed a\npartnership with the strategic objective of gaining competitive advantage through mutual\naccess to low-cost raw materials. One outcome was the establishment in the UK of a small\nChemco facility (70 employees) which was sandwiched between two units within a large\nWheatco plant (700 employees). The two Wheatco units were feedstock manufacture (\u2018TCS\u2019)\nand rubber manufacture.\nThe two firms thereby formed a \u2018closed loop\u2019 supply chain (see Figure 1), whereby they were\nboth customer of and supplier to each other. The production processes operated on a round-\nthe-clock basis and there was very little buffer stock within the supply loop: \u2018if we have a\nproblem, then Chemco has a problem 10 seconds later\u2019. This close interdependency of the\nprocesses meant that the operating teams were in contact on a 24-hour basis. There was a\ndirect telephone link between Wheatco and Chemco operators to allow easy communication\nand instant warning of changes in either of the processes, or to inform of production\nstoppages.\nFigure 1 Wheatco Chemco process\nBasics - TCS building\nFeedstock 1 & 2\nmanufacture\n(Fluid bed reactor)\nChemco\nchemical\nadditive (A1)\nmanufacture\nRubber\nManufacture\nBuilding 115\nB2 gas\nRaw material\nsupply\nWheatco Chemco\nRecycled B3 Gas\nOther\n8The supply relationship was multifaceted, with interactions taking place at many levels.\nLocally it included plant management, engineers and operators. In the USA, an executive\ncontact was appointed by each firm to manage the relationship at a strategic level. This\napplied in particular to the global contract agreement, which provided the commercial terms\nfor the relationship. A joint Steering Committee determined the local operational strategy for\nthe relationship and provided guidelines to two other joint teams: quality improvement (QIT)\nand Technical. We record further details in our earlier paper.\nHistorical perspective on the relationship\nA historical perspective was gained from interviews with former or current members of the\nsupply relationship (at operator, engineer and management level) as well as from the study of\nhistorical documents, such as meeting minutes. These were used to establish the chronology\nof the process, to identify key individuals as well as transitions points (Pettigrew, 1997: 345).\nThis historical view is called for by the literature arguing for a dynamic view of supply\nrelationships (Spekman et al 1998) and by tenets of processual analysis. History is viewed as\n\u2018crucial\u2019 (Pettigrew, 1997, p. 341) because it explains the current situation of the relationship:\nantecedent conditions shape the present and the emerging future\u2026 the past is alive in\nthe present\nFour main stages could be identified in the evolution of the relationship between its start up in\n1992, when the joint production process became operational, until we began our on-site\nresearch in mid August 2000. Each of these stages will be briefly reviewed.\nStage 1: Early days (1992-1994)\nI remember in the early days when we first started it was hard work, because we were\ntraining and they were training and we were both under pressure to get the jobs done\nand get the plant running right and it was a few fuses as you can imagine between the\noperators but again that was on the learning curve. (Chemco operator)\nChemco was a greenfield site and it was necessary to set up the whole infrastructure,\nincluding the HR system. Wheatco\u2019s feedstock manufacturing facility (\u2018TCS\u2019) could draw\nquality, safety, environment and HR infrastructure from the larger Wheatco site - and had to\nmaster a new fluid bed reactor technology. Both Chemco and Wheatco operators had to learn\nto deal with the interdependence of their production processes. A technical team with\nmembers from TCS and Chemco had been meeting from the start. A few social events, such\nas pigeon clay shooting and skittles, were organised. Overall, the situation was rather tense:\nWhenever there were problems, there was conflict.\nStage 2: Progress (1995-1996)\nBy 1995, the learning curve at local level had taken place, and the Chemco plant capacity had\nbeen expanded. Although processes were still unreliable (especially TCS), the relationship\nitself had improved. A common language had been developed at operator level, through\ninteraction: we may spend a day there, they spend a day here. This period was characterised\nby a higher interaction and more collaboration at local management level. QIT meetings\nincluded local members from Wheatco\u2019s TCS and Rubber facilities, and the Chemco plant.\nStage 3: Stabilisation (1997-1998)\n9Both companies were very busy internally, with implementation of technical and quality\nprogrammes, which took up many resources. The process side of the relationship seemed to\nshow \u2018improvement in combined on-line-time\u2019. Within one year, rather unobtrusively, four\nout of the five TCS operators, who had been there since the start up of the plants, were\npromoted to shift manager positions in a new Wheatco expansion. It seemed, during that\nperiod, that there was less interaction at management level, and the Technical and QIT teams\nwere less active. At the end of 1998, the interaction started to deteriorate:\nWe had a frosty relationship; it was a set of hidden agendas (Wheatco management).\nStage 4: Worsening (1999-2000)\nIn January 1999, Chemco replaced four out of the five shift managers. Therefore, at control\nroom level, there were a lot of new faces in both Wheatco and Chemco. The level of\ninteraction was reduced dramatically, as no formal socialisation was organised. Operators\nstarted to feel that they could not \u2018put a face to a name\u2019.\nThe situation at technical level was marred by unreliability of Wheatco\u2019s TCS fluid bed\nreactor, as well as by quality problems with Chemco\u2019s chemical additive. A new facility\nmanager was appointed at Chemco in June 2000. He was faced with the challenge of meeting\na new business opportunity for Chemco - provided the site could show that it was capable of\nmeeting both the process and quality requirements of the new business.\nAt the start of our work on site in August 2000, the supply relationship was relatively long\nestablished, but not in a robust state. To compound the recurrent technical and quality issues,\nyears of lack of socialisation at operator level expressed itself in terms of low levels of trust\nand a tendency towards adversarial relationships. The recurring issues between TCS and\nChemco put a strain on the overall relationship - diagnosed as a \u2018blame culture\u2019 (Chemco\nengineer). Our research project was proposed and agreed by both firms in June 2000: both\nfirms agreed to have an external view of the role of HR practices within the relationship.\nHR PRACTICES AS CARRIERS\nWe collected evidence of institutionalisation of the supply relationship by analysing the\nevidence collected from seven HR practices: staffing, job design, appraisal, rewards, training,\nsocialisation and communication. Each of these practices is summarised in our earlier paper\n(Koulikoff-Souviron and Harrison, 2007, p. 13).\nStaffing\nAn informal assessment was performed across the two firms, to gauge the quality of the\npeople who worked within the relationship. Indeed a direct link was established between the\nlevel of competence of the people and performance:\nI see more of an urgency from Chemco to make results and put good people in place of\npoor people (Wheatco manager).\nIt was taken for granted that the quality of the people assigned to the relationship was\nreflecting the level of priority allocated to it:\nThey obviously see their other business as more important than Wheatco because the\ntwo people that they\u2019ve put on that other team are people who have really delivered\nresults and made improvements for us in the past (Wheatco engineer)\n10\nAt management level, the \u2018calibre\u2019 was gauged:\nI think that the calibre of individuals that we have needs to be as good as the calibre of\nindividuals that Wheatco has (Chemco manager).\nOne implication was that the individual did not feel legitimate in his job, when there was a\ndifference in qualification with the corresponding position in the other firm. This was\nacknowledged by the Chemco Quality person, who compared his own background:\nI came from the maintenance department into the quality role\nto the background of his Wheatco counterparts:\nthe people that I deal with and I\u2019ve spoken to are highly qualified, they\u2019re chemists or\nthey\u2019ve got a doctorate and all that kind of stuff.\nThus chemical engineering was viewed as the legitimate background at management level.\nAt operator level, \u2018experience\u2019 was viewed as the determinant of relationship performance.\nThis referred to prolonged exposure to the other firm that allowed building up of an\n\u2018understanding\u2019, not only of the technical process, but also of the relationship functioning.\nA normative view emerged of the specific behaviours and skill-sets required to work on the\nrelationship, beyond the technical realm. Different requirements emerged at different levels\nin the relationship:\nYou have to know when to say no and when to compromise (Wheatco corporate). It\ndemands a calibre of individual that are more mature. I think broader skills, technical\nskills of running our plant as well as the interpersonal skills, when they speak on the\ntelephone to people at Wheatco (Chemco manager).\nYou want to make sure you don\u2019t have too many live wires, who get upset easily\n(Chemco engineer)\nStability was a desired way of building good relationships with the partner: this is why people\nturnover was disruptive:\nYou lose your association between a name and a face (Chemco operator)\nAs people move into different jobs, and areas, you\u2019ve got different people and you\u2019ve\ngot to build it all up again, really, from scratch (Wheatco manager).\nIndeed, people turnover was a barrier to the construction of a common frame of meaning in\nthat it disrupted the established interpersonal links, as well as the shared language developed\nover time, which made communication over process coordination more difficult:\nI suppose we have abbreviations for certain things which we\u2019ve developed over eight\nyears of running the plant of which we did originally with the original Wheatco plant\noperators. Now we\u2019ve got these new people coming in, we might try and explain\nthings, which they don\u2019t understand. (Chemco operator)\nOverall, staffing was viewed as an HR practice, which was driven by internal priorities.\nJob design\nDifferent norms applied to work organisation across both plants. Thus the same job title\ncould cover different roles in both companies. For example, Wheatco being a unionized site,\nthe job design there was more structured and less flexible than at Chemco\u2019s:\n11\nIf the plant was running today and broke down tomorrow we would be able to call\npeople from all over the place, get them in there and sort of do the review and get on\nwith the job. Whereas they would seem to have to follow a much more rigorous process\n(Chemco manager).\nDifferences in \u2018ways of working\u2019 were a source of frustration as they pointed to different\nframes of reference. Thus, the shift manager had a different job content at Wheatco where the\nsupervision was less close than at Chemco, primarily due to the size of the operation:\nTheir shift manager will say he\u2019ll get back to me on a problem and all he will do is go\nto his operator, get some advice and then ring me back (Chemco engineer).\nWe have a bigger area to look after, more plants if you like. We spend less time looking\nafter our TCS plant than they spend looking after Chemco\u2019s because it\u2019s one plant.\n(Wheatco Engineer)\nTherefore, specific communication needed to take place to avoid misinterpretation by the\nother firm. Thus normative statements referred to the necessity to inform, train people about\nthe other firm\u2019s job design:\nIf you don\u2019t understand, you assume that the other company does things the same way\nas you do and it may not be the case (Wheatco management).\nNew roles emerged at the level of the relationship that required a broader perspective than\nwould have been needed in an internal context. This was quite unique and challenging:\nI was quite surprised that an operator or lead operator down here would be dealing\none on one with the outside company. I was slightly fazed by it at the start, a little\nintimidated, only at the start. Once you\u2019re on the phone to people a couple of times it\u2019s\nfine (Wheatco operator).\nIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve dealt with an external company in such depth. It\u2019s something new\nwhich is a challenge. (Wheatco engineer)\nI need to be focused on, conscious of and be aware of, much more than just this facility\n(Chemco manager).\nAppraisal\nDistinct value systems appeared in the informal assessments of the quality of the individual\nassigned to work on the relationship. There were no formal mechanisms for giving feedback;\nthis took place through informal discussions.\nWe don\u2019t have a formal mechanism for giving feedback; we don\u2019t do it in a structured\nway. I will ask how is X doing or how is Y doing. What do you think of those? I get\nfeedback on our people from some of the Chemco people (Wheatco manager)\nIn one specific instance, the assessment from the partner was used as influencing factor in the\noutcome of the appraisal. A negative feedback expressed by Wheatco managers contributed\nto the decision to move a Chemco Quality manager out of the relationship. This meant to\nsome extent, that the sanction was carried over to the inter-organisational level.\nI asked them if I could be blunt (about my opinion of the Quality Manager) and they\nsaid OK. So that\u2019s what I did. And they made changes and that\u2019s good (Wheatco\nmanager).\n12\nHe has expressed concerns about the capability of some of the people in our quality\norganisations. He\u2019s right, but it\u2019s nice to feel that he can say that and for us not to be\ndefensive about that. The change we made on quality was happening anyway. All his\ncomment did was reinforcing that this was the right thing to do. (Chemco manager).\nMost of the comments were normative assessments or expectations that did not involve\ndisciplinary measures and did not have a major influence on the outcome of the appraisal:\nThere\u2019s been the odd complaint in the early days about people\u2019s attitudes and\nbehaviours but that wasn\u2019t taken as far as disciplinary, that was maybe even an off the\ncuff comment that someone wasn\u2019t as friendly or helpful as he could be (Chemco\nmanager)\nRewards\nBonus schemes were a source of conflict in that one of the partners (Chemco) aligned its\nrewards on the relationship results - output from the joint production process - while the other\n(Wheatco) had performance indicators (productivity, production rates, reliability) at overall\nsite rather than specific unit level. In the past, it was possible for Chemco operations to\ndiscount the downtime caused by Wheatco process breakdowns for the bonus calculation.\nHowever, upon the arrival of the Chemco new facility manager, he decided that this\ndiscounting would no longer be done. Indeed, Chemco operators needed to feel accountable\nfor downtime caused by their Wheatco counterparts, inasmuch as they could influence such\ndowntime through better cooperation:\nWhen you have an issue with Wheatco and you speak to the operator on the phone you\ndon\u2019t regard them as the opposition where you just want to find out and be critical of\nwhat they\u2019ve done, you want to offer help, you want to offer support (Chemco manager)\nThis was interpreted as an attempt to leverage the internal Chemco HR practice to indirectly\ncoerce the partner\u2019s operators.\nThey have Chemco operators with this carrot, which is this bonus, the reliable\noperation, very frustrated because a lot of the problems lie in our plant and they can\u2019t\ndo anything about it and that leaves them to put an awful lot of pressure on our\noperators (Wheatco manager).\nAttempts by Chemco management to influence the Wheatco reward system remained\nunsuccessful. Thus rewards remained an internal work organisation issue, and failed to serve\nas joint control mechanism at supply relationship level. The main reason was the prevalence\nof Wheatco\u2019s site-wide logic for HR practices, underpinned by union negotiations, over the\nlocal relationship with Chemco.\nAt the same time, rewards contributed to a blame culture and the question of their\nappropriateness was raised between the two firms.\nTraining and socialisation\nThe contractual agreement that governed the relationship prescribed the formation of three\njoint teams to monitor the relationship: a \u2018joint steering committee\u2019 to resolve operational\nissues that may arise and to set plans and strategies, a Quality Improvement Team and a\ntechnical team. Through these teams, interaction \u2013 at least at management and engineering\nlevel \u2013 was a formal part of the regulation of the relationship.\n13\nAt shop floor level, the need for shared understanding and common frames of meaning was\nspecifically referred to in the context of recurrent technical problems that affected the two\norganisations. Indeed, the joint transformation process (fluidized bed reactor) was\ncharacterised by a complex technology which was hard to control and by incomprehensible\nfailures. This had implications in terms of operator approach to their work: they were eager to\ngain a better understanding of the other site\u2019s production processes, as a way to unveil the\nvagaries of their own process operations (\u2018learning how the two plants affect each other\u2019).\nThis involved a call for extended work socialisation involving face to face interaction to\nallow transfer of knowledge that drew on tacit rather than codified modes of learning. Thus\nroutine coordination could take place:\nwith the old operators, we didn\u2019t need to communicate where if something did go\nwrong they would automatically take care of it (Chemco operator)\nSuch cooperation could only result from intensive face-to-face work interaction:\nI think the more interaction you can get at that level the better, because the people here\nknow immediately what the impact would be at Wheatco of one of their actions and\nlikewise (Chemco operator)\nTo get a better idea of the process they do so that when we phone them we know the\nquestions to ask, we may be able to say, oh see that pipeline that goes onto the hopper,\nmaybe it\u2019s that (Wheatco operator)\nIn view of the technical uncertainties that surrounded process performance, there was no\nconsensus within the management as to the benefit that could be drawn from joint work at\noperative level. Following a worsening of the relationship however, weekly operator\nmeetings were organised. These became an opportunity for developing a common\nunderstanding of the process issues through deep probing and exchange of tacit, individual\nknowledge. This involved a questioning of the existing practices and an emergence of new\npractices:\nThe Chemco operator asked a lot of questions and said why do you do this, why do you\ndo that, and our guy explained it and had a bit of dialogue about it. But also our\noperators asked the Chemco operator, this gives us problems why do you do this, and\nwhy do you do that and they got some explanations and people have actually gone\naway and started thinking about these things and questioning whether they have to be\ndone that way or whether they can be changed. (Wheatco manager)\nIf you understand why you\u2019re doing it that way, if something then goes wrong you can\nimmediately make a decision rather than it being like a random choice (Chemco\nengineer).\nThus the operators attempted to understand and diagnose the problems and propose various\nad hoc solutions. That resulted in mutual awareness of the joint process functioning.\nUnderstanding the problems faced by the counterpart also contributed to developing an\nemotional bond:\nHe walked away thinking I cannot believe you have that many problems. So he could\nsympathise. That was good (Wheatco operator).\nVisits from one manufacturing plant to another were not set up as part of a formal training\nplan. However informants argued that a formal programme would ensure persistence of\nsocialisation practices across both firms.\n14\nYou\u2019ve probably got to make your external interactions a bit more structured to ensure\nthat communication and interaction takes place otherwise there\u2019s a risk that it won\u2019t\nhappen as much as it needs to (Wheatco engineer).\nCommon language could be a by-product of shared training (\u2018everyone talked the same sort\nof SPC language\u2019) or a result of common engineering culture:\nSo when they talk to you about the technicalities of their process and when you talk to\nthem about the technicalities of our process when they see that we\u2019re reaching an\nunderstanding with one another, that builds a relationship (Chemco manager).\nTo some extent, learning about the unique features of this intricate reciprocal relationship\nrequired a counterintuitive approach as it meant drawing on a different value system from the\nstraightforward concern for \u201cown company\u201d. Hence, the induction process for new hires\ninvolved a sense-making that required acquisition of tacit rather than explicit knowledge:\nI had to allow him to get educated. And there is only so much I can tell him. There are\nthings that he needs to learn on his own, which I\u2019m very glad he is learning on his own\nnow, how this across the fence relationship is so special, so different that you can\u2019t\nthink that Wheatco is just a customer and a supplier (Chemco corporate).\nI had to find out by practicing, by finding out how the relationship worked (Chemco\nmanager)\nCommunication\nLocal management from Wheatco and Chemco felt they were closer to the actual issues and\ntherefore better able to make the right decisions than \u2018people sitting in America\u2019. Their\nreaction was to legitimate collusion at local level, as a way to ensure that local priorities were\nmet:\nWe have this Wheatco corporate link and then we have this local link and I think\nbasically what I\u2019m going to do in the future is make decisions and then ask them\nafterwards because it\u2019s quicker (Chemco manager)\nWhat we tend to do is that we will talk to Chemco locally and decide to do something\nand once we\u2019ve done it, we tell the corporate people we\u2019ve done it and that way they\ncan\u2019t stop us (Wheatco manager).\nInternal communication was seen as having an effect on the relationship, in that it supported\nthe multifaceted interaction. Such communication took place locally at the level of the\nSteering Committee, where the Chemco and Wheatco managers in charge of the three\nmanufacturing units sat. At the beginning of 2001, towards the end of the research project, a\n\u2018Steering committee charter\u2019 was written to provide a prescriptive guidance about the local\nrelationship\u2019s purpose and mode of interaction:\nTo set the direction and tone for the Wheatco Chemco UK strategic partnership,\ncontinuous improvement plans, and working interfaces (Steering team charter).\nAnother purpose of this charter was to elicit better communications with corporate hierarchy:\nTo ensure that local issues, agreements and commitments are shared, discussed and\nreviewed with corporate functions.\nDISCUSSION\n15\nWe have organised this section to address the two research questions raised earlier.\n1) How do HR practices contribute to the institutionalisation of a supply relationship?\nWe found evidence that HR practices contribute to the institutionalisation process of the\nsupply relationship through both formal and informal mechanisms. As shown in Table 3, we\nfound it possible to classify our selected HR practices as a mix of regulative, normative and\ncultural-cognitive dimensions.\nTable 3: Evidence of HR practices as carriers of regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive\n\u2018pillars\u2019 within the supply relationship\nHR Practice Regulative Normative Cultural-Cognitive\nStaffing No evidence of\ninterfirm regulative\nelements\nCalibre of the people\nassigned to the relationship\nStability as a desired way\nof building good\nrelationships.

Sanctioning of a Chemco\n16\nmanager as a result of feedback from Wheatco was an informal, indirect process. The Chemco\nsite manager\u2019s instrumentalisation of the internal reward system to control the behaviour of\nthe partner\u2019s operators was also an attempt to indirectly regulate at relationship level.\nThe limited evidence of regulative influences and the prevalence of normative and cognitive\ninfluences were striking. If the three \u2018pillars\u2019 do indeed form a continuum, then perhaps\nregulatory influences form a foundation from which the other two evolve into more\ninterdependent supply relationships. For example, bonus schemes did not address inter-firm\nregulation from the start - so both normative and cultural-cognitive dimensions evolved into\nnegative aspects of the supply relationship.\nNormative processes associated with HR practices introduce prescriptive, evaluative and\nobligatory dimensions (Scott, 2001, p. 54) in the supply relationship. Within Chemco, there\nwas reference to the necessary induction of new managers who had to internalise the\nspecificities of the relationship, drawing on tacit rather than explicit learning modes. The need\nfor more understanding of each other\u2019s processes through extended visits that had been\nexpressed by operators from the Wheatco and Chemco control rooms seemed to draw on a\nsimilar need to better appreciate the overall functioning of the relationship. In a similar vein,\nthe informal evaluation and feedback process across the two firms signalled an implicit\nreference to common standards. This highlighted the central role of the normative process for\nthe functioning of the supply relationship, and is reminiscent of Lamming\u2019s (1993) \u2018quasi-\nfirm\u2019 framework, which shows that employees would develop a concern for the relationship in\nits own right.\nThe normative facet was tightly related to the cultural-cognitive element, in that extended\nsocialisation allowed the move from a relational effect to a cognitive one through shared\nunderstanding and generation of tacit knowledge (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1997). Equally,\nnegative effects on inter-organisational relationships were evident in this dimension - such as\ncultural differences, people turnover and collusion.\n2) How does institutional theory explain the evolution of a supply relationship over time?\nScott (2001, p. 122) argues that \u2018persistence of institutions is not to be taken for granted\u2019. The\nhistory of the Wheatco-Chemco supply relationship illustrates this: after the initial difficult\nlearning period (stage 1), institutionalised practices were strengthened at inter-firm level\n(stage 2) as a result of more interaction and resource flows. However, after a stabilisation\nstage, there was a gradual deterioration (stage 3), with joint practices being neglected or\nsimply abandoned as a result of a lower priority given to the relationship by both partners.\nThe result was a decay, or de-institutionalisation, of the relationship (stage 4).\nIn the course of our research, a process of re-institutionalisation was apparent. Requirements\nfor the functioning of the supply relationship, and contingencies such as product quality and\nprocess failures, forced the emergence over time of new processes at the inter-firm level. New\nroutines were designed such as weekly operator meetings and the changes to operational\npractices that resulted. Sense-making among operators helped them cope with vagaries of\nhigh technology processes (Weick, 1990; Hatch, 1995). Induction in the relationship involved\na cultural shift from a focus on the own company payback to a concern for the shared benefit\nat relationship level. This meant that new approaches were also required to deal with jobs and\nroles. Innovative practices emerged at all levels of the relationship (management, engineering\nand operators).\n17\nA distinct characteristic of HR practices within Wheatco-Chemco was that they were elicited\neither within or outside of the boundaries of the joint relationship. Thus socialisation, broader\nroles, joint communication or informal assessment across plants could be viewed as practices\nthat were institutionalised at the inter-firm level. Other practices such as rewards or job design\nremained insulated from the relationship, in that they were solely focused on the priorities of\nthe internal site work organisation (Koulikoff-Souviron and Harrison, 2007). Hence, a tension\nemerged between two kinds of institutional pressures: at inter- and intra-organisational levels.\nOne example was the dynamics of the local\/corporate communication, with some instances of\ncollusion of management at local site level (inter-firm) that counteracted the internal\nhierarchical communication (intra-firm). The steering team charter aimed to reconcile the two\nby ensuring that communication took place both at inter- and intra-organisational levels. This\ntension was also particularly explicit in discussions about the quality of the people assigned to\nthe relationship and the inference that low competence of counterparts meant that precedence\nwas given to internal priorities. An over-arching belief in the benefits of the relationship\nemerged, but the need to support it often conflicted with the reality of the daily practices that\nwere rooted in the rationale of the internal work organisation. This mirrors the findings of\nRogers et al (2007) concerning the potential conflicts between imposed institutional demands\nand internal operating efficiency constraints.\nOliver (1992) identified three reasons for \u2018deinstitutionalization\u2019, which are processes by\nwhich institutions weaken and disappear: political, functional and social pressures. We\nbelieve this case provides an illustration of such processes. Thus, conflict over poor process\nperformance or disruptive bonus schemes were at the origin of a deviation from the norms of\nreciprocity (political pressure). Competition for scarce resources meant that inter-firm\npractices were abandoned in favour of internal projects (functional pressures). Weak\nsocialisation and high turnover meant impairing shared understanding at both technical and\nrelational levels (social pressures).\nContribution\nThis paper builds on our earlier paper (Koulikoff-Souviron and Harrison, 2007) by proposing\nthat conflicting institutionalisation processes at intra- and inter-firm levels can explain the\n\u2018insulation\/adaptation\u2019 behaviours of the partners. Our earlier paper identified these\nbehaviours but did not explain them theoretically, other than in terms of \u2018separate\u2019 (ACR) \u2013\n\u2018together\u2019 (OCR).\nInstitutional theory proposes a strong framework that can categorize the OM literature (see\ntable 2) and provides a richer and more dynamic picture of the supply relationship. This\n\u2018alien\u2019 (Amundson, 1998: 353) theoretical perspective challenges the traditional OM poles,\nACR and OCR. It explains the coexistence of collaboration and conflict and provides a\nframework for viewing different concepts as interdependent rather than independent.\nThis paper proposes an explanation for the evolution of the relationship, whilst also providing\na predictive angle. If partners fail to continue to put resources in place to nurture the\ninstitutionalisation of the relationship, institutional theory predicts that they will grow apart\nagain and will resort to conflict and adversarial leverage. This results in reduction in the\nbenefits of integration, and economic loss for both partners.\nOM\u2019s fine-grained perspective and detailed operationalisation of constructs enriches\nInstitutional theory, which tends to lack empirical indicators of institutional processes (Scott,\n2001: 211), which our study was able to provide. Moreover, this study has operationalised\ninstitutional theory in an inter-firm context (Rogers et al 2007).\n18\nCONCLUSION\nThis research has illustrated ways in which HR practices contribute to the institutionalisation\nof a supply relationship by probing the influences they had on providing stability and\nmeaning to social life within the relationship. HR practices were broadly viewed here as\nroutines or organisational activity bundles (Delery, 1998) that build up relationship-specific\ncapabilities. They pertained to decisions about internal HR processes as well as to inter-\norganisational practices and routines.\nThe study highlights a reluctance to promote the institutionalisation process because of\npotential conflicts with the requirements of the internal work organisation. We explained this\nas a conflict between organisational and inter-organisational processes of institutionalisation.\nPriority alternated between the individual organisation\u2019s interest and possible benefits at\nsupply relationship level. Thus the two organisations tended to be reluctant to make changes\nin their internal HR practices to satisfy the needs of their supply partner. This highlighted the\ndifficulty of mutual adjustment that has to take place as part of the institutionalization\nprocess.\nWe noted that the process of institutionalisation of the supply relationship was more the\nresult of emergent, informal behaviour of the actors who worked in the relationship rather\nthan resulting from a strategic intent from the two firms involved. Thus, cultural-cognitive\nbehaviour was developed at an operational rather than at a strategic level. Training and\nsocialisation appeared to be the one HR practice where a continuous, positive series of\ntransitions were made. This resulted in an enhanced sharing of tacit knowledge. We\nconsidered that table 3 could be used as the basis for a tool for diagnosing the relative health\nof HR practices as they impact supply relationships.\nA challenge for OM is to \u2018provide an intimate understanding of the problems faced by\npracticing managers\u2019 (Amundson, 1998, p. 354). Our study indicates that management of an\ninterdependent supply relationship is best formed by consistent choices within the three\nscenarios proposed in table 1. Our results suggest that aspects of all three \u2018pillars\u2019 are present\nin such a relationship, but that regulative influences were less prevalent. Instead, normative\ninfluences \u2013 formed by mutual adaptation \u2013 become the driver of change. After that, the\ncultural-cognitive influences evolve more spontaneously. As table 3, indicates, however,\nnormative influences are the product of the context of their formation, and can have either\npositive or negative impacts on the developing supply relationship. The implications are that\nmanagers must guide and monitor the process of evolution of normative influences to\nmaximise the positive effects in later stages of relationship formation. Negative aspects\n(such as conflicting pressures created by non-aligned bonus schemes) become leveraged in\nthe cultural-cognitive phase by negative meanings (such as \u2018blame culture\u2019). Instead of\nmutual reinforcement, the three \u2018pillars\u2019 represent discord between what was intended\n(regulative), what was constructed (normative) and the meaning that resulted (cultural-\ncognitive). Avoiding such discord demands what the first principle of Deming (1986, p. 23)\nwould term \u2018constancy of purpose\u2019, and consistency during the phases of evolution of a\nsupply relationship over time.\nWe have addressed Scott\u2019s (2001, p. 211) call for \u2018more empirical indicators of institutional\nprocesses\u2019. Our paper contributes, with a novel institutional perspective, to the emergent\nliterature on the role of HR practices in inter-organisational settings. The limitations are that\nour findings are confined to a single case, that they are context-specific (interdependent\n19\nrelationships evolve over time) and that our methodology is resource intensive. However, we\nhave found evidence that HR practices can be used to explore the difficult and messy area of\nsupply relationships in combination with institutional theory.\nREFERENCES\nAmundson, S.D.
