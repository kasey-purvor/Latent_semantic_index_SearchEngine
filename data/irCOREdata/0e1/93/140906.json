Introduction \nThe atmospheric surface layer couples the atmosphere with the Earth's surface.  Over \nheterogeneous surfaces, widely represented globally, atmospheric structure is complex \nand only partially understood [5].  One of the aims of ReSeDA was to study the spatial \nstructure of the surface layer (below 100 m) and energy fluxes between the surface and \nthe atmosphere. \nPractical means of measuring atmospheric structure are limited. Available techniques are \n(a) remote sensing, e.g. Raman lidar [1] or tomography [12], and (b) in situ \nmeasurements, either from a mobile vehicle, e.g. aircraft [2], or using a dense network of \nfixed masts.  An uninhabited aerial vehicle (UAV) was chosen for this project because of \nits versatility in terms of payload, field operations and flight pattern.  The objectives of the \nUAV flights were (1) to evaluate UAV's for ABL research, and (2) to investigate the \nsurface layer structure near boundaries between different landcover types in various \nweather conditions. \nThe following sections introduce a sample of relevant literature, describe the experiments \nperformed for ReSeDA in June 1997 and the sensor calibrations, summarise the results, \nand then discuss the findings. \n2. Previous Studies \nMahrt [7] gives an excellent overview of current understanding of the structure of the \natmospheric boundary layer (ABL) as it adjusts to changes in surface properties in \ndifferent conditions.  Two key concepts for understanding ABL structure close to the \nsurface and the way surface fluxes aggregate are (1) the internal boundary layer - the \nregion of the atmosphere where flow changes downwind of a surface transition to be in \nequilibrium with the new surface, and (2) the blending height - the height at which fluxes \n 4\nfrom individual surface types average out and lose their horizontal variation.  Kaimal and \nFinnigan [5] discuss internal boundary layers, and the blending height concept is \nexamined by, for example, Schmid and B\u00fcnzli [10].  Observations of ABL structure \ncorresponding to these concepts are difficult to obtain and were one goal of the \nexperiments performed for ReSeDA. \nAircraft have been used as research vehicles in the atmosphere for many years.  Recent \ndevelopments in technology however enable small and light but very capable aircraft to \nbe built and several have been demonstrated [3,4,6,8].  Developments in micro air \nvehicles may in time lead to further tools for micrometeorology.  Aerosonde [3,4,8] is \nsimilar in size, mass and payload to the aeroplane used for ReSeDA but is not designed \nfor measurements within 10 m of the surface and the airframe appears to be less robust. \n3. Experiments and Aircraft \nThe experiments comprised a set of flights over 4 days at 3 sites in the ReSeDA area \n(see Table I).  The aircraft was flown at 25 ms-1 at various heights (1-15 m) into the wind \nacross field boundaries. Each flight lasted about 20 minutes and typically included 15 \nhorizontal profiles. \nThe aircraft built for the experiments has a span of 2.5 m, mass of 15 kg, and is remotely \npiloted.  Figure 1 shows it ready for take-off from its bungee-powered launch rail. The \naircraft lands on short grass or bare soil.  Reliable operation of such aircraft requires \nsignificant practical expertise. \nThe aircraft sensors were GPS for position (a base station GPS receiver enabled \ndifferential mode position measurements), a fine Pt wire thermometer for temperature, \nand a bare Vaisala Humitter (model 50-Y) for humidity.  The Pt wire thermometer is used \nto measure relative temperature since this is more significant for atmospheric structure \nthan absolute temperature (which could be obtained using a reference thermometer if \n 5\nneeded).  The Pt wire sensitivity to solar radiation is <0.005 K and no shading is required.  \nThe Humitter is sensitive to insolation at low airspeeds but at 25 ms-1 the effect is \nsignificantly reduced.  The Pt thermometer\u2019s bandwidth is estimated to be >30 Hz. \nThe Humitter's time response in flight is difficult to measure directly, but has been \nestimated by two methods: analysis of flight data and direct experiments.  The Humitter \nhas two sensor elements, one each for temperature (Pt film) and humidity (moisture \nabsorbing polymer).  The humidity measurement reported is relative humidity which \ndepends on air temperature and absolute humidity.  Direct measurements of the time \nconstants (obtained by moving the Humitter rapidly between dry \/ moist and cool \/ warm \nair) give the following principal results (Humitter with silvered cap removed). \n\u2022 Results showed wide scatter, and the shortest time constants measured were 2.7 \ns (temperature) and 0.28 s (humidity) (airflow ~3 ms-1, i.e. ~10% of flight speed). \n\u2022 Where both time constants could be measured, the mean ratio (\u03c4Humidity \/ \n\u03c4Temperature) was 0.36 \u00b10.06. \n\u2022 The humidity response is faster for changes in mixing ratio than temperature. \nSince two different temperature sensors were carried during the flights, it is possible to \ncompare the frequency response of the two sensors (Pt wire and Humitter).  The Pt wire \nhas a much higher bandwidth and has been used as a reference against which the \ntransfer function for the Humitter\u2019s temperature sensor can be measured.  Figure 2 \nshows typical results to which a first order time constant model has been fitted.  The time \nconstant of the Humitter\u2019s temperature sensor estimated by this method is 1.86 s. \nCombining these results suggests that the effective time constant for the humidity \nmeasurements will be 1.86 x 0.36 = 0.67 s (this may be conservative by a factor of 2 \nsince values less than half this have been measured directly).  The corresponding \nbandwidth is 1 \/ 2 \u03c0 \u03c4 = 0.24 Hz which corresponds to a length of ~100 m at flight speed. \n 6\nEach sensor's readings were logged at 16 sample s-1 with 2nd order anti-aliasing filters \n(the GPS measurement rate is 1 Hz).  The Pt wire temperature sensor data thus have an \neffective bandwidth of 8 Hz, corresponding to structures of ~3 m at flight speed.  \nRegulations for operating remotely piloted aircraft and for data telemetry must be \ncomplied with. \n4. Results \nFive datasets were recorded: (1) payload sensors (temperature, humidity), (2) aircraft \nGPS position, (3) reference station GPS data, (4) video log of the flights, and (5) site data \n(feature locations and surface elevation) from maps.  Data processing was a major task \n(about 50% of project effort) and comprised checking the data quality, GPS data analysis, \nand producing regular coordinated datasets.  The full datasets and supporting \ndocumentation are available from the ReSeDA database (www.avignon.inra.fr\/reseda). \nFigures 3 and 4 show sample results.  Figure 3 has subplots of data from Flight 4 \n(overcast weather) showing (a) the aircraft height as a function of time and (b) its \nhorizontal position (when below 15 m) over the site relative to field boundaries.  The \naircraft flew between fields with bare soil (Field 121) and harvested alfalfa (Field 203, \ncoordinates are relative to a local site origin).  The other two parts of the figure show the \nmeasured (c) temperature relative to the mean temperature over the whole flight, \nshowing a lapse rate of -10 K km-1 indicative of neutral stability (consistent with the \nPasquill-Gifford stability class estimated from standard meteorological data), and (d) \nabsolute humidity, with scatter of ~5% and some near-surface enhancement. \nFigures 4 (a) and (b) show example horizontal profiles of temperature and humidity from \nFlight 9 (during which there was strong insolation and a surface wind of 4-5 ms-1).  These \ndata are illustrative, and require significant additional information for rigourous analysis \nand interpretation.  It appears that a temperature contrast exists at all three heights \n 7\nplotted, and that the peak temperature moves downwind with increasing height \n(displaced ~50 m per 20 m height increase).  For humidity the strongest contrast is close \nto the surface but structure is apparently still detectable at 50 m (land cover upwind and \nthe exact flight path followed require further investigation).  These results show that the \naircraft with even this basic level of instrumentation is able to detect structure and \ninfluences of the surface on the atmosphere.  More detailed analysis is possible using the \ndata to obtain parameters such as the structure constant, from which inferences can be \nmade concerning heat fluxes. \n5. Discussion \nThe key findings of the research to date are the experience of using a UAV for near-\nsurface measurements and the observations of contrast in atmospheric properties near \nboundaries in various conditions (weather and landcover). \n5.1 Unmanned Aircraft \nThe experiments involved UAV operations at three sites; one vehicle was used to \ntransport all equipment and no local support facilities were required.  The aircraft was \noperated without major damage (although the Pt wire temperature sensor did require \nreplacement).  Bare soil and short grass were the easiest surfaces to operate from - long \ngrass damages sensors and decelerates the aircraft abruptly on landing.  A skilled pilot \nwas able to fly the aircraft using visual contact to a range of about 1 km, and close to the \nsurface (height < 3 m) to a radius of 200 m.  Pilot concentration and the aircraft's fuel \nload limited safe flight duration to about 20 min.  Flights were repeated at intervals of \nabout 2 hr.  An autonomous aircraft would be capable of more intensive operations and \nwould be well-suited to routine measurements but a human pilot is generally better able \nto adapt to the evolving requirements which characterised these exploratory flights. \n 8\nTo maximise scientific yield the experimenter needs to assess sensor data in (near) real-\ntime to detect faults and exploit opportunities.  Aircraft can be used most effectively when \npart of a coordinated experiment with clear objectives.  Other reports of similar UAV \noperations are rare, but Shields and Testa [11] provide useful practical details. \n5.2 ABL Structure \nStructures compatible with the internal boundary layer concept have been observed, as \nhas some reduction in horizontal heterogeneity with height.  The strongest contrast was \nobserved in unstable conditions with differing surface cover (e.g. dry vs irrigated), \nwhereas in neutral conditions little contrast was observed at any boundary.  This pattern \nis consistent with the literature.  The analysis performed is largely qualitative, and more \nrigourous analysis of the data requires results from quantitative models of ABL structure \nand may need more extensive experiments. \nWe note that the conditions in which the strongest contrast was observed (Flights 9,10) \nalso corresponded to the case where there was the most significant physical barrier \nbetween fields (a dyke with shrubs rather than wire fence or narrow strip of rough \nground).  If this helped provide a steadier internal boundary layer it would have made the \ncontrast easier to observe in these experiments where several passes during a period of \n20 minutes are used to investigate structure. \n6. Conclusions \nThe experiments demonstrate that a UAV is capable of observing ABL surface layer \nstructure near landcover boundaries, and is a practical research platform.  Good sensor \ncharacterization, and good quality, timely, payload data properly coordinated with wider \nexperiment data in a convenient format are important for scientific applications.  For the \natmospheric stability conditions (neutral and unstable) and field sizes (a few hundred \n 9\nmetres) experienced, the horizontal contrast in the ABL below 30 m was strongest in \nunstable conditions. \n7.

Without the commitment of \nUAV engineers at Cranfield the experiments would not have been possible within the \nshort timescale available.  The support of the whole ReSeDA team and the referees' \nconstructive comments are much appreciated. \n8.

UAV flights for the ReSeDA experiments in June 1997.  Atmospheric stability is described using the Pasquill-Gifford stability classes [9], \nwhere A and B are unstable, C is neutral stability, and D is stable.  More details are available from the ReSeDA database.  Flights consisted of \n10-15 circuits with low passes into wind perpendicular to field boundaries at heights up to 15 m; the aircraft returned to the downwind side of the \nboundary at about 50 m.
