It is shown that narrow channels of high electric\nfield are an effective mechanism for injecting plasma into the\ninner magnetosphere. Analytical expressions for the electric\nfield cannot produce these channels of intense plasma flow,\nand thus, result in less entry and adiabatic energization of the\nplasma sheet into near-Earth space. For the ions, omission of\nthese channels leads to an underprediction of the strength of\nthe stormtime ring current and therefore, an underestimation\nof the geoeffectiveness of the storm event. For the electrons,\nomission of these channels leads to the inability to create a\nseed population of 10\u2013100 keV electrons deep in the inner\nmagnetosphere. These electrons can eventually be acceler-\nated into MeV radiation belt particles. To examine this, the\n1\u20137 May 1998 magnetic storm is studied with a plasma trans-\nport model by using three different convection electric field\nmodels: Volland-Stern, Weimer, and AMIE. It is found that\nthe AMIE model can produce particle fluxes that are several\norders of magnitude higher in the L = 2 \u2212 4 range of the\ninner magnetosphere, even for a similar total cross-tail po-\ntential difference.\nKey words. Space plasma physics (charged particle motion\nand acceleration) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics (electric fields,\nstorms and substorms)\n1 Introduction\nWhen an explosive solar flare leads to an interplanetary coro-\nnal mass ejection (ICME) directed at the Earth, large dis-\nturbances in the geomagnetic environment around the planet\nensue (Gosling, 1993). One aspect of the resulting magnetic\nstorm, as it is called, is the formation of an intense torus of\ncurrent around the Earth. This net-westward-flowing current,\npeaked a few planetary radii above the surface in the equato-\nrial plane, grows for several hours (perhaps a day) during the\nCorrespondence to: G. V. Khazanov\n(george.khazanov@msfc.nasa.gov)\npassage of the ICME. At some point, usually associated with\nthe peak energy input rate (Wu and Lepping, 2002), this cur-\nrent reaches its maximum level and begins to decline back\nto its nominal prestorm level. This decay can be rapid or\nslow, depending on the dynamics of the particles in the mag-\nnetosphere and the ionic composition of the current carriers\n(Hamilton et al., 1988; Takahashi et al., 1990; Kozyra et al.,\n1998; Liemohn et al., 1999, 2001).\nThis so-called ring current is formed by charged particles\nbeing injected into the inner magnetospheric region due to\nenhanced convective forces (e.g. Alfve\u00b4n and Fa\u00a8lthammar,\n1963; Lyons and Williams, 1984). Because the magnetic\nfield strength monotonically increases and the field line\nlength monotonically decreases as one moves closer to the\nEarth, this inward convection leads to particle acceleration.\nThis energization results from conservation of both the first\nand second adiabatic invariants. As the particles enter the\ndipole-dominated magnetic field near the Earth, they begin\nto azimuthally drift according to the gradient, curvature, and\nmagnetization drift terms. The net azimuthal flow from these\ndrift terms is charge dependent, however, with the ions trav-\neling westward and the electrons traveling eastward around\nthe planet. This differential flow results in a westward cur-\nrent, known as the ring current around the Earth.\nThe formation of the stormtime ring current has been stud-\nied extensively over the years. As computational resources\nincrease, bigger and more sophisticated numerical models\ndescribing the flow of particles through near-Earth space\nhave been created, allowing for a closer examination of the\nphysics involved in this process. Several large-scale ring cur-\nrent codes exist that are presently being used to increase our\nunderstanding of the acceleration of particles in the inner\nmagnetosphere (see the recent reviews by Wolf and Spiro,\n1997; Chen et al., 1997; Daglis and Kozyra, 2002). This\nincludes the identification of partial ring current dominance\nduring the main and early recovery phases, the realization\nthat dayside magnetopause flowout is a major loss process\nfor ring current particles, and a quantitative assessment of the\n498 G. V. Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics\nimportance of wave-particle interactions on the ion distribu-\ntion in localized regions (particularly the afternoon sector).\nOne of the largest uncertainties associated with modeling\nthe injection of the ring current is the description of the large-\nscale electric field. Created by the interaction of the solar\nwind magnetic field with the magnetosphere, this field pro-\nvides the convective force to push the particles into the inner\nmagnetosphere. Its dynamical configuration in this region is\nstill a subject of debate. Until recently, in situ measurements\nwere the only means of diagnosing the magnetospheric par-\nticle distribution function. From these particle data, several\nempirical electric field models have been created, such as\nthat by Nishida (1966) and Brice (1967), Volland (1973) and\nStern (1975), and McIlwain (1974, 1986). While satellites\nsuch as CRRES have produced statistical compilations of the\ninner magnetospheric electric field (Rowland and Wygant,\n1998), the fields are highly variable (up to 6 mV\/m) in the\nnightside at 2 < L < 6 for large Kp. Ionospheric observa-\ntions such as those made by the DMSP satellite (e.g. Burke\net al., 1998; Anderson et al., 2001) and ground-based radars\n(e.g. Foster et al., 1986; Yeh et al., 1991), also show high\nvariability in the subauroral nightside during active times.\nThat said, statistical models are still one of the best options\nfor describing the near-Earth electric fields. They have been\nused both successfully and unsuccessfully to reproduce the\nobserved features of the stormtime ring current (e.g. Chen\net al., 1993, 1999; Kozyra et al., 1998, 2002; Jordanova et\nal., 1998, 2001; and Liemohn et al., 2001, 2002). Only re-\ncently (from the IMAGE satellite) have global snapshots of\nthe plasma morphology in the inner magnetosphere been ob-\ntained with a quality suitable for detailed, quantitative analy-\nsis (Burch et al., 2001), and progress in extracting the electric\nfield from these images is slow.\nBecause the field lines of the inner magnetosphere pass\nthrough the mid-latitude ionosphere, the convection pat-\nterns here are often useful to help explain the dynam-\nics at the higher altitudes. Using the statistical model of\nWeimer (1996), Jordanova et al. (2001) showed that this tech-\nnique produces better comparisons against in situ data than\ndo the results using the Volland-Stern electric field model.\nAnother ionospheric convection description is obtained\nthrough the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrody-\nnamics (AMIE) technique (Richmond and Kamide, 1988).\nThis approach uses any available ionospheric data for a\ngiven time to produce an instantaneous convection pattern.\nBoonsiriseth et al. (2001) discussed a semiempirical method\nof mapping these convection patterns out from the iono-\nsphere into the inner magnetosphere, finding that the AMIE\nmodel produces small-scale structures in the potential pat-\ntern that are not seen in either the Volland-Stern or Weimer\nmodels. However, an additional \u201cpenetration\u201d electric field\n(e.g. Ridley and Liemohn, 2002) must also be included to\nmatch the observed electric field magnitudes on the dusk-\nside low-L-region during storm main phases. Recently, Chen\net al. (2003) showed that the AMIE-derived equipotentials\nconcentrate in the evening sector during the main phases of\nstorms, providing rapid transport of plasma sheet ions into\nL\u223c3 \u2212 4 (even L\u223c2 for extremely large events). These\nstudies indicate that even though the cross-magnetospheric\npotential difference is similar for different models, the mor-\nphology of the potential pattern plays a crucial role in the\nformation of the stormtime ring current.\nIn this study, several electric field models will be used in\nconjunction with a ring current transport model to examine\nthe differences in the net acceleration to the particles. By\nexamining not only the electric field patterns in the inner\nmagnetosphere but also the resulting ion and electron energy\nspectra, it is possible to identify the physical mechanisms be-\nhind the energization process. In addition, the consequences\nof these differences in acceleration will be discussed, reveal-\ning the importance of an accurate description of the large-\nscale electric field in the inner magnetosphere. This study\nwill focus on a particular magnetic storm, that of 1\u20137 May\n1998. This was a very large storm in which the ring current\ndeveloped quite rapidly, and so it is a good candidate for in-\nvestigating particle energization and flow. It is also a storm\nthat has been previously studied by this group (Khazanov et\nal., 2002), where the influence of self-consistently calculated\nion cyclotron waves were examined (particularly the effects\nin the late recovery phase). Here, the analysis focuses on the\ninitial development of the ring current. Three different elec-\ntric field models will be compared: Volland-Stern, Weimer,\nand AMIE.\n2 Model description\nWe simulate the hot magnetospheric plasma dynamics by\nsolving the bounce-averaged kinetic equation for the phase\nspace distribution function, Q, of the RC ions and electrons\n\u2202Q\u03b1\n\u2202t\n+ 1\nR0\n2\n\u2202\n\u2202R0\n(\nR0\n2\n\u2329\ndR0\ndt\n\u232a\nQ\u03b1\n)\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03d5\n(\u2329\nd\u03d5\ndt\n\u232a\nQ\u03b1\n)\n+\n1\n\u03b3\n\u221a\n\u03b3 2 \u2212 1\n\u2202\n\u2202E\n(\n\u03b3\n\u221a\n\u03b3 2 \u2212 1\n\u2329\ndE\ndt\n\u232a\nQ\u03b1\n)\n+\n1\nf (\u00b50)\u00b50\n\u2202\n\u2202\u00b50\n(\nf (\u00b50)\u00b50\n\u2329\nd\u00b50\ndt\n\u232a\nQ\u03b1\n)\n=\u2329\n\u03b4Q\u03b1\n\u03b4t\n\u232a\ncollis\n\u03b1 = e,H+ (1)\nas a function of position in the magnetic equatorial plane\n(R0, \u03d5); kinetic energy and the cosine of the equatorial pitch\nangle (E,\u00b50); and time t . Note that the equation is written\nin relativistic form, where\n\u03b3 = 1+ E\nmc2\n(2)\nand all of the coefficients in Eq. (1) are converted accord-\ningly (Khazanov et al., 1999). All of the bounce-averaged\nG. V. Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics 499\nquantities in Eq. (1) are denoted with < ... >. On the left-\nhand side, the bracketed terms are the perpendicular flow\nspeeds, and include all electric and magnetic drifts. These\nvelocities, one for each independent variable in the calcula-\ntion, will be determined from a number of electric field de-\nscriptions, to be discussed below. The f (\u00b50) coefficient is a\nbounce-averaging term that ranges from 0.74 to 1.38 (Ejiri,\n1978). The term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) includes\nlosses from charge exchange (only for ions), Coulomb colli-\nsions (pitch angle scattering and energy degradation terms),\nand precipitation at low altitudes (assumed lost at 800 km\naltitude along each field line). Each of the drift and loss\nterms is dependent on spatial location, energy, and pitch an-\ngle, and can be different for each species. Charge exchange\nand atmospheric loss are both treated as attenuation multi-\npliers, while Coulomb collisions are described through an\nenergy advection term (loss only) and a pitch angle diffu-\nsion term. The formulations for these processes are the same\nas those discussed in Jordanova et al. (1996). For the elec-\ntrons, pitch angle diffusion into the loss cone, resulting from\ninteractions with the whistler mode waves in the plasmas-\nphere, is taken into account via attenuation factors (Lyons et\nal., 1972). The source of the particles is flow through the\nnightside outer simulation domain boundary (12RE down-\ntail). Loss through the dayside magnetopause is also taken\ninto account, allowing for the free outflow of the RC elec-\ntrons and ions from the simulation domain. For further de-\ntails about the solution of the kinetic equation (1), please\nsee Jordanova et al. (1996, 1997), Khazanov et al. (1998,\n1999), and Liemohn et al. (2001). In the calculations be-\nlow, several methods will be used to calculate the electric\nfields in the inner magnetosphere. One will be the ana-\nlytical formulation of the Volland-Stern potential (Volland,\n1973; Stern, 1975), assuming a shielding factor of 2 (nom-\ninal shielding near the Earth) and driven by the 3-h Kp in-\ndex (Maynard and Chen, 1975). The pattern is rotated 2 h\nof local time westward to better match the large-scale con-\nvection patterns of the other two models. Another electric\nfield will be an ionosphere-to-magnetosphere mapping of the\nWeimer-96 model (Weimer, 1996), driven by upstream solar\nwind measurements (1-min time cadence). A final electric\nfield model will be an ionosphere-to-magnetosphere map-\nping of the AMIE inversion (Richmond and Kamide, 1988)\nof ground-based (magnetometer and radar) and ionospheric\n(DMSP satellite) data for this interval (also with a 1-min time\ncadence).\nBackground and boundary conditions are also an impor-\ntant consideration for these simulations. The code uses a\nRairden et al. (1986) geocoronal description for the charge\nexchange coefficients, and a Rasmussen et al. (1993) plas-\nmaspheric model for the Coulomb collision coefficients. A\nstatic but disturbed Tsyganenko and Stern (1996) magnetic\nfield is used for these calculations, so the results can focus\non the influences of the electric field on the ion and electron\ndistribution functions. All of the runs use kappa distributions\napplied at the outer simulation boundary (12RE downtail)\nfor the source populations of the ions and electrons,\nj (r, E) = n(r) 0(\u03ba + 1)\n(pi\u03ba)3\/20(\u03ba \u2212 1\/2)(\n1\n2m0E0\n)1\/2\nE\nE0\n(\n1+ E\n\u03baE0\n)\u2212\u03ba\u22121\n, (3)\nwhere the differential number flux j is related to the distri-\nbution function by j = 2EQ\/m2. The coefficients are set by\nupstream solar wind measurements. A kappa distribution is\nthought to be reasonable because of the isotropization and ac-\nceleration of the plasma by the large amplitude plasma waves\nand magnetic fluctuations in the tail (e.g. Ma and Summers,\n1999).\n3 The 1\u20137 May 1998 storm\nThe ICME that hit the magnetosphere on 4 May 1998 was a\ncompound stream of a large magnetic cloud interacting with\na trailing high-speed stream. Several studies have examined\nthe solar and heliospheric aspects of this event (Gloeckler et\nal., 1999; Skoug et al., 1999; Farrugia et al., 2002), and de-\ntails of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field can\nbe found therein. It is actually this stream that hits early on\n4 May 1998, after the cloud had passed by geospace on 2\u2013\n3 May 1998. Figure 1 shows the geophysical response to\nthis activity. The Dst index shown in Fig. 1a is an hourly\nvalue of the globally-averaged mid-latitude magnetic pertur-\nbation in the north-south direction. In Fig. 1b, Kp is a 3-h\ncadence global activity index related to the amount of fluc-\ntuation in auroral-zone ground-based magnetometer records.\n(See Mayaud (1980) for further information about these in-\ndices.) Both of these indices are highly disturbed during the\nearly hours of 4 May 1998. Kp is registered on a quasi-\nlogarithmic scale with a range of 0 to 9, and it reaches 9-\n(second highest value) for one interval (03:00\u201306:00 UT).\nThe Dst index plummets from an already disturbed value of\nroughly \u221262 nT to \u2212205 nT in only 3 h, indicating the pres-\nence of a huge ring current. This index then recovers very\nquickly and is back up to \u2212125 nT only 5 h later. Note that\nduring this fast decay of the ring current, Kp is still elevated,\nindicating the presence of strong magnetospheric convection.\nA useful quantity to consider for each of the three elec-\ntric field descriptions to be discussed in this study is the to-\ntal cross-tail potential difference. The basic configuration of\nthe magnetospheric convection pattern is a dawn-to-dusk ori-\nented potential drop (that is, electric field), which drifts the\nplasma sunward. By finding the maximum and minimum\nvalues of the potential, as specified by these various tech-\nniques, it is possible to obtain a quantitative assessment of the\nstrength of the flow in the inner magnetosphere. The lower\n3 panels of Fig. 1 show this cross-tail potential difference\nfor the three field models. It is seen that the Weimer-96 po-\ntential difference spikes up to more than 300 kV during the\nmain phase injection early on 4 May 1998. Similarly, the\nAMIE potential difference also has a peak value at this time\n500 G. V. Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics\nFig. 1. Geophysical quantitites during the 1\u20137 May 1998 magnetic storm. The first two rows are the Dst and Kp global indices. The next\nthree panels show the total cross-tail potential differences during the 4 May 1998 storm from the Volland-Stern model, the Weimer-96 model,\nand the AMIE model.\nof around 250 kV. The Volland-Stern potential drop, how-\never, is much lower, with a peak value of just over 100 kV.\nThis is partly due to the extent of the magnetosphere during\nthis interval, because the Volland-Stern potential is directly\nproportional to the distance away from the Earth. Hence, a\nlarger magnetosphere results in a bigger potential difference\nthan would a smaller magnetosphere.\n4 Results\nThis study focuses on the formation of the particle distribu-\ntion function in the inner magnetosphere assuming, various\ndescriptions for the large-scale electric field. As mentioned\nabove, three field models will be used: (1) the Volland-Stern\nempirical model, driven by the 3-h Kp index (interpolated at\neach time step); (2) the Weimer-96 empirical model, driven\nby the 1-min cadence solar wind and interplanetary magnetic\nfield data; and (3) the AMIE model, driven by 1-min resolu-\ntion ground-based magnetometer data.\nIn order to isolate the effects of the electric field config-\nuration, all three simulations are run with exactly the same\ninitial and boundary conditions for the inner magnetospheric\nplasma populations. The source term for the plasma is the\nnightside plasma sheet, which is defined by Eq. (2), above\nwith \u03ba = 3 and the parameters n and E0 specified by the\nupstream solar wind\nn(t)\n[\ncm\u22123\n]\n= 0.025NSW(t \u2212 3h)+ 0.395\nE0(t) [\u03baeV ] = 0.02VSW(t \u2212 3h)\u2212 3.0 (4)\nas determined from data the (Borovsky et al., 1998; Ebihara\nand Ejiri, 2000). In Eq. (3), the units are cm3 for NSW and\nkm\/s for VSW. The initial conditions are those specified by\nSheldon and Hamilton (1993) for the quiet ring current.\nAll of the runs were begun at 00:00 UT on 1 May 1998\nand carried out through the end of 7 May 1998. In this study,\nonly a small portion of these simulation results are examined,\nnamely those around 00:00 UT on 4 May 1998, when the Dst\nindex plummeted toward its minimum value (that is, during\nG. V. Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics 501\nthe main phase injection of the stormtime ring current). It\nis during this period that the most intense electric fields are\npresent in the inner magnetosphere, making it an ideal inter-\nval to study the acceleration of plasma in near-Earth space.\n4.1 Electric potentials\nFigures 2, 3, and 4 show electric equipotential contour plots\nin a region around the Earth (\u00b112RE in the x\u2212y plane). The\n8 panels of each figure are consecutive hourly snapshots of\nthe convection pattern. Each figure shows the patterns for the\n3 electric field descriptions, as listed. These times are during\nthe main phase of the storm on 4 May 1998 (01:00 UT to\n08:00 UT on that day). Because the electric field is directly\nproportional to the gradient of these potentials, the relative\nspacing of the contour lines (drawn every 6 kV) show the\nrelative strength of the electric field as a function of space\nand time. Note that the corotation electric field has been\nadded to all of these plots. Therefore, the equipotential con-\ntour lines are the instantaneous cold-plasma drift trajectories\nthrough this region. Higher energy particles will, of course,\nalso have the energy, pitch angle, and charge dependent ef-\nfect of the magnetic gradient-curvature drift superimposed\non these trajectories. Even so, it is useful to examine these\nplots to understand the flow of the plasma sheet particles\ninto the inner magnetosphere during this event. If the elec-\ntric field is strong enough, the convective drift can dominate\nthe gradient-curvature drift, even for high-energy ions and\nelectrons. The discussion below will therefore focus on the\nmorphology of the potential patterns, especially on regions\nof intense electric fields (that is, closely-spaced equipotential\ncontours). Such regions will be places of high-speed plasma\nmotion along these equipotential lines, and so they will be re-\nferred to as \u201cflow channels\u201d hereinafter, similar to the Chen\net al. (2003) study. In fact, Chen et al. (2003) show drift paths\ninstead of equipotentials for these flow channels in the inner\nmagnetosphere, and so it is useful to compare those results\nwith the ones presented here.\nTake a look at Fig. 2, which contains the patterns for the\nVolland-Stern electric field description. They all look very\nsimilar to each other in their general morphology. The re-\ngion near the Earth, where the corotation potential dominates\n(a minimum at the Earth, so it is an inward electric field and\nthus an eastward drift), expands and contracts with the wan-\ning and waxing of the cross-tail potential difference of the\nlarge-scale convection field (maximum at dawn, so it is a\ndawn-to-dusk electric field and thus a sunward drift). This\nis the classic description of magnetospheric convection, with\na teardrop-shaped separatrix dividing the closed trajectories\nnear the planet and the open trajectories farther away. The\ncold-plasma drift trajectories preferentially flow around the\ndawn side of the Earth. In all of these plots, the stagnation\npoint is well defined and is always located at about 6RE just\nsunward of dusk (not exactly at dusk because the pattern has\nbeen rotated westward slightly).\nNow consider Fig. 3, containing the patterns for the\nWeimer-96 electric field description. Even though the same\ncorotation potential has been added to both sets of plots, the\nWeimer-96 contours are quite a bit different than the Volland-\nStern patterns. For one, the stagnation point is rotated toward\nmidnight (post-dusk rather than pre-dusk), and the separatrix\nis much closer to the Earth. The electric fields, as evidenced\nby the concentration of equipotential contours in a given re-\ngion, are also larger beyond the separatrix for this field de-\nscription. Of particular interest for this study are the intense\nelectric fields in the post-dusk region, where the equipoten-\ntials are closely spaced and point right at the Earth. This\nphenomenon, which will be dubbed a flow channel, is clearly\nseen at hours 76 (04:00 UT) and 77 (05:00 UT). While the\nconvective electric fields in the Volland-Stern field never ex-\nceed 1 mV\/m inside of a 8RE radius from Earth, in the\nWeimer-96 model they are able to reach values of 1.7 mV\/m\nin this flow channel.\nIn Fig. 4 (those for the AMIE electric field description),\nthe convection patterns are even more exotic. Flow chan-\nnels form and disappear regularly during this interval, with\nthe most intense one at hour 78 (06:00 UT) directed right\nalong the midnight meridian. Here, electric fields in ex-\ncess of 3 mV\/m exist in a narrow band stretching from the\n12RE outer boundary of the plot into the 2RE inner bound-\nary of the contour traces. These fields are capable of moving\nplasma from one end of this channel to the other in less than\nan hour, that is, with electric and magnetic field strengths of\n3 mV\/m and 100 nT (a nominal field strength near geosyn-\nchronous orbit), respectively, the drift speed is 17RE \/h. So,\neven though these channels are short-lived in any specific\nlocation (the particular one at hour 78 (06:00 UT) is not\npresent in the midnight sector at either hour 77 (05:00 UT) or\n79 (07:00 UT), for instance), they are still capable of inject-\ning massive amounts of plasma into the inner magnetosphere,\nas will be shown below.\nIn comparing the cross-tail potential differences given in\nFig. 1 with the patterns shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4, it is\nseen that the Weimer-96 model produced the largest cross-\ntail potential difference, while the AMIE model produced the\nlargest electric fields. Because the energization of the plasma\nis directly related to how far the plasma is injected into the\ninner magnetosphere, it is really the electric field that mat-\nters for this study. Therefore, while it is useful to consider\nthe cross-tail potential difference as a general indicator of the\nconvective strength at a given time, it is really the morphol-\nogy of the potential pattern that yields the strong flow chan-\nnels capable of adiabatically accelerating the plasma sheet\nparticles up to ring current energies.\n4.2 Particle energy spectra\nTo illustrate the effect of these flow channels on the particles,\nthe pitch angle averaged energy spectra of differential num-\nber flux will be examined. Figure 5 presents the results for\nprotons at hour 74 (02:00 UT), a time near the start of the\nmain phase of the 4 May 1998 storm. Even here, before the\nmain storm, there are significant differences in the flux levels\nbetween the various simulations. This is because there was\n502 G. V.

Contours are shown every 6 kV, and are not drawn inside of 2RE or beyond the magnetopause, as specified in the model. Note that\ncorotation is included in the potential pattern.\nFig. 3.

Note that corotation is included in the\npotential pattern.\na smaller storm on 2 May 1998 that was still persisting (Dst\nwas still below\u221250 nT at the start of 4 May 1998). At larger\nradial distances, the 3 models produce nearly identical spec-\ntra, because this is essentially the outer boundary condition,\nparticularly true at MLT = 00. At smaller radial distances,\nthe differences become clear. The AMIE fields are capable of\ncreating an energetic population deep in the inner magneto-\nsphere (flux peak near 100 keV) that is several orders of mag-\nnitude larger than that from the other field models. The peak\nat the highest energy bin (near 400 keV) in the Volland-Stern\nand Weimer-96 field results are remnants of the specified ini-\ntial condition. Very little new protons have been injected thus\nfar in the storm sequence, by either of these two field mod-\nels. The AMIE potentials, however, even with modest cross-\ntail potential differences of under 150 kV, have been able to\ngenerate a substantial new ring current inside of 4RE . The\nWeimer-96 fields, even though they have had larger cross-tail\npotential differences earlier in the sequence, have been able\nto only generate a small ring current in this region.\nTaking these fluxes as a reference point, now consider\nthe fluxes plotted in Fig. 6. These are results at hour 80\n(08:00 UT, 6 hours later), after the main phase of the storm\n(just past the minimum in Dst ). The results at L = 6.5\nand 4.3 are quite similar to those in Fig. 5. This is because\nthese radial distances are, in general, on open drift paths even\nfor moderate convection, and thus even the small storm on 2\nMay 1998 can populate this region with fresh plasma sheet\nions. At L = 4.3, MLT = 16, however, the lower-energy part\nof the spectra is filled in for the AMIE field results, while\nthe other models still show the standard \u201caccessibility gap\u201d\nin the spectra. This minimum at a few keV is due to the\ninterplay between the corotation, convective, and gradient-\ncurvature drifts for protons. Corotation is eastward while\ngradient-curvature is westward (convection is basically sun-\nward). Ions of a few keV have gradient-curvature drifts on\nthe order of the corotation drifts around L = 3 \u2212 5, and so\nthese ions stagnate on the nightside and are slowly lost due to\ncollisional processes (mainly charge exchange and Coulomb\nG.

Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics\nFig. 6. Same as Fig. 5 except for protons at hour 80 (08:00 UT, end of the main phase).\ninteractions). That this minimum is not evident in the AMIE\nfield results indicates that, at some point on the nightside, the\nconvective drift was strong enough to overcome this stagna-\ntion and push the ions in toward the Earth.\nAt smaller L values (3.2 and 2.6), the differences between\nFig. 6 and Fig. 5 become more apparent. At L = 3.2, the\nlow-energy range of the spectrum is enhanced for all of the\nfield models at MLT = 00 but only for the AMIE field run\nat MLT = 16. The sharp peak near 20 keV at MLT = 16 in\nthe Weimer-96 and Volland-Stern field results are from con-\nvective access during the main phase. However, it is seen\nthat neither of these models were capable of producing the\nhigh-energy population that the AMIE field results show. At\nL = 2.6, the differences between the AMIE results and the\nother model results are even more dramatic. Again, there\nis a peak near 30 keV in the Weimer-96 and Volland-Stern\nfield results at MLT = 16, but these do not reach the AMIE\nflux levels, and neither the low nor high energy tails of the\nspectrum are even close to the AMIE field flux levels. In\ncomparing Figs. 5 and 6, it is seen that the AMIE fields dur-\ning the main phase on 4 May 1998 increased the high-energy\nflux levels by at least an order of magnitude at the deepest\nL shells. This energization is primarily due to the rapid in-\njection of plasma sheet ions via the flow channels and their\nintense electric fields.\nA similar analysis can be done for the electron flux spec-\ntra. These particles have an eastward gradient-curvature\ndrift, and so this term is in the same sense as a corotation.\nTherefore, stagnation will only occur where these two drifts\nare equal and opposite to the convective drift, which gen-\nerally occurs in the dusk sector (if at all). The net influ-\nence is that the plasma sheet electrons will all flow eastward\nduring injections, in contrast to ions that might flow in ei-\nther direction, depending on their energy. Therefore, it is\nmore difficult to inject electrons deep into the inner magne-\ntosphere, especially the high-energy electrons (for which the\ngradient-curvature drift term is large). A very intense electric\nfield is needed to bring these particles inside of L = 4.\nG. V. Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics 505\nFig. 7. Same as Fig. 5 except for electrons at hour 74 (02:00 UT, start of the main phase).\nFigure 7 shows the electron spectra from the three simula-\ntions at hour 74 (02:00 UT). As with the ions, the L = 6.5\nfluxes are very similar between the models and are close\nto the outer boundary flux values. Deeper in the L shell\nand at the sub-100-keV energies, it is seen that the Weimer-\n96 model produces consistently higher flux levels than the\nVolland-Stern field simulation. In turn, the AMIE model\nyields higher flux levels than either of the other two in this\nrange. Again, it is not the total potential difference that de-\ntermines the flux levels but the maximal localized electric\nfields that preferentially bring in the plasma sheet electrons\nto the inner magnetosphere. At the smaller radial distances,\nthe Volland-Stern results are a good indication of the pre-\nscribed initial condition values.\nFigure 8 shows electron flux results at hour 80 (08:00 UT),\nafter the main phase of the storm. The changes are subtler\nthan those seen in the ion results, but interesting features\nshould be pointed out. Consider, for instance, L = 4.3.\nHere, the Weimer-96 and AMIE potentials yield enhanced\nfluxes in the high-energy tail of the distribution compared\nto their prestorm fluxes, while the Volland-Stern model pro-\nduced almost no change at all (except in the lowest energy\nchannels shown). This difference is from convective access\nof these particles into the inner magnetosphere. How far in\ndid they penetrate? Examining the results at L = 3.2 and\nL = 2.6 shows that the fluxes are either at or slightly be-\nlow their prestorm values. Therefore, the inward penetration\nof electrons due to the flow channels was much less criti-\ncal than that for the ions. Note that, because of differences\nin the characteristic energy and number density between the\nhot ions and hot electrons, most of the total energy in the\ninner magnetosphere is carried by the hot ions rather than\nthe hot electrons, and, therefore, it is the energization of the\nions that plays the vital role in forming a strong stormtime\nring current near the Earth. That said, the sub-100-keV elec-\ntrons that are brought in by these flow channels form the seed\npopulation for the radiation belts. Through resonant inter-\nactions between plasma waves and the drift period of these\n506 G. V. Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics\nFig. 8. Same as Fig. 5 except for electrons at hour 80 (08:00 UT, end of the main phase).\nelectrons, additional acceleration can result, yielding a post-\nstorm radiation belt enhancement, as is often seen (e.g. McIl-\nwain, 1996, and references therein).\n4.3 Temporal evolution\nTo understand the global morphology differences in the par-\nticle distributions resulting from the electric field choices,\nFigs. 9 and 10 present color spectrograms of the pitch-angle\naveraged flux at a given energy throughout the inner magne-\ntosphere. The two figures are for ions and electrons, respec-\ntively. Each of the plots in Figs. 9 and 10 show the results\ninside of 6.6RE (geosynchronous orbit; which is a conve-\nnient but somewhat arbitrary boundary for the inner magne-\ntosphere). In addition, local midnight is to the right, dawn\nis to the top, noon is to the left, and dusk is to the bottom in\neach plot. There are three sets of 15 plots in Figs. 9 and 10.\nThe 15 plots are at 5 times throughout the storm event and\nat 3 energies. The times are as follows: 3 May at 16:00 UT\n(hour 64, before the storm); 4 May 1998 at 02:00 UT (hour\n74, at the start of the main phase); 4 May 1998 at 08:00 UT\n(hour 80, just after the storm minimum); 4 May 1998 at\n16:00 UT (hour 88, during the recovery phase); and 5 May\n1998 at 00:00 UT (hour 96, in the late recovery phase). These\nare chosen to illustrate the temporal evolution of the results\nbefore, during, and after the energization process. For the\nions (Fig. 9), the chosen energies are the computational bins\ncentered at 8 keV, 38 keV, and 106 keV, while for the elec-\ntrons (Fig. 10), the chosen energies are 10 keV, 96 keV, and\n297 keV. These are selected to best highlight the differences\nbetween the results from the 3 electric field models.\nIn Fig. 9, it is seen that all three field models have com-\nparable fluxes of 8 keV ions in the inner magnetosphere. In\nfact, the results from the AMIE potential simulation have,\nin general, lower fluxes than the other two simulations at this\nenergy. It is also seen that the fluxes at this energy are quickly\ndepleted during the recovery phase of the storm. This is due\nto the fast charge exchange time scale for H+ ions below\nG. V. Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics 507\nFig. 9. Pitch-angle averaged H+ differential number flux at 5 times during the storm (columns). For each of the 3 electric potential\ndescriptions (sets of rows), 3 energies are shown (rows in each set). Each plot extends to 6.6RE , with gray circles drawn every 2RE . Local\nnoon is to the left and dawn is to the top in each plot.\n30 keV (e.g. Fok et al., 1991). At higher energies, the dif-\nferences between the field models become more apparent.\nFor both the 38 keV and the 106 keV results, there is a clear\nincrease of flux intensity from the Volland-Stern potential re-\nsults to the Weimer-96 potential results to the AMIE potential\nresults. This is especially true at 106 keV, where the AMIE\npotential was able to form a strong symmetric ring current\nin the 2\u20134RE range. The 106 keV fluxes from the AMIE\npotential continue to increase into the recovery phase of the\nstorm due to acceleration of lower-energy particles through\nresonant interaction with the electric field variations. This\nshows that the energy spectra shown in Fig. 6 are not iso-\nlated examples that best show the differences, but are rather\ntypical examples that fit into a larger pattern of systematic\ndifferences between the simulation results.\nFigure 10 shows a similar picture for the electron fluxes.\nFor the electrons, a seed population in the 100 keV to 1 MeV\nrange is needed for creation of the radiation belts after\nstorms. Therefore, a desired result is the injection and cap-\nture of the plasma sheet electrons into a well-formed elec-\ntron ring current. The Volland-Stern potential description is\nincapable of producing a torus of intense electron fluxes in\nthe inner magnetosphere. The Weimer-96 model is better\nat producing this feature, particularly at injecting electrons\ninside of 4RE . The AMIE model, however, is exceptionally\ngood at creating an intense electron ring current. All three se-\n508 G. V. Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics\nFig. 10. Same as Fig. 9, except for electrons. Note that the selected energies are different than those chosen for the ion results.\nlected energies are higher than the results from the other two\nelectric potential models practically everywhere in the inner\nmagnetosphere. It is clear that the flow channels are respon-\nsible for creating this injection and adiabatic energization of\nthe electrons.\n5 Conclusions\nIt was the goal of this study to present simulation results that\nshow the importance of flow channels into the inner mag-\nnetosphere for the formation of the stormtime ring current.\nThese flow channels are very efficient at producing high-\nenergy ions close to the Earth (inside of L = 4), and are\ntherefore thought to be a major contributor to the formation\nof the stormtime ring current. These flow channels, which\nare regions of densely-packed equipotential lines pointed at\nthe Earth (that is, strong azimuthal electric fields yielding\nlarge inward drifts) can wax and wane on the order of an\nhour. Even still, this is ample time for the convection of par-\nticles from the near-Earth plasma sheet into the inner magne-\ntosphere.\nA consequence of this is that modeling of the stormtime\nring current must include these high-speed channels, or the\ngeoeffectiveness of the storm event will be underestimated,\nthat is, not as many ions will be brought in close to the Earth,\nand thus the ring current strength will be underpredicted by\nthe simulation. The Volland-Stern model, which has been\nused extensively in ring current modeling, was shown in this\nstudy to be completely incapable of producing flow channels\nin the electric field distribution.\nG. V. Khazanov et al.: Magnetospheric convection electric field dynamics 509\nAnother influence of these flow channels is the creation of\nthe seed population for the radiation belts. These flow chan-\nnels are capable of injecting electrons up to 100 keV deep\ninto the inner magnetosphere. Subsequent wave-particle in-\nteractions and acceleration processes can energize these elec-\ntrons into the MeV range (e.g. Elkington et al., 1999; Sum-\nmers and Ma, 2000), where they can then damage spacecraft\nelectronics and subsystems through dieletric charging. With-\nout these flow channels, this seed population is not created,\nand therefore other mechanisms must be contemplated for\nthe creation of the radiation belts after storms. This study\nshows that a realistic potential pattern that includes intense\nflow channels can produce the necessary seed population.\nAcknowledgements.
