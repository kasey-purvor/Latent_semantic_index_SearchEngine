INTRODUCTION  \nNowadays, the paradigm in distributed applications is \nshifting towards Service Oriented Architecture. In the past \nfew years, various web services have been deployed on the \nInternet, and more are likely to come. The amount of the \nservice users, however, grows in a nonlinear manner. A \nmajor challenge faced service-oriented applications is to \nmaximize the utility of those available web services and \nsupport the largest number of users. To handle this issue and \nguarantee the quality of services, researchers propose the \nidea of service reservation, which is usually implemented by \na SLA (Service Level Agreement) protocol. Many service \nvendors have widely used the scheme of service reservation \nto improve their profits now, such as airline companies and \nhotels [1].  \nIn reality, reserving only one web service is no solution \nto dealing with more complicated requirements which are \nexpressed as business processes. The reasons for this are \nmanifold, but typically relationships between services (such \nas airline-hotel partnerships) as well as different frame \nparameters (such as different reservation times) that have an \ninfluence on overall requirements (such as cost). \nAs service oriented applications can be built from single \nor composite services, we can conclude that the reservation \nschemes can also be divided into service reservation and \nprocess reservation. Many service-oriented applications \nshow that it is more desirable if all web services required for \na process can be reserved in advance. Most customers need \nprocess level reservation to get complete results (for example \ntrip reservation or scientific workflows). However, less effort \nhas been paid to the scheme of process reservation in which \nthe service relationships impose constraints on the \nreservation of each related service.  \nIn this paper, we propose a novel process reservation \nscheme, named BPSR (Business Process Service \nReservation) to solve this problem and increase the profit of \nboth the service provider and the service consumer. The \nprocess reservation scheme is a promising solution for the \nseamless integration of many services to create new value-\nadded services for applications. \nII. METHODOLOGY \nA. Overview of BPSR Architecture Framework \nThe proposed framework for process reservation, depicted in \nFig 1, is based on three key components: Policy Generator, \nProcess Reservator and QoS Controller. \nBriefly the Policy Generator is concerned with \nidentifying the customer flexibility and expressing this for \nthe Process Reservator which will provide the user with \noptions of the whole process and their cost. The QoS \nController ensures that current QoS information is being \nused. \nProcess \nReservator\nFlexible Policy\nOrdinary \nPolicy\nControl Flow\nData Flow\nController\nService State\nRejected\nAdmitted\nPicky Policy\nPolicy-based \nApproaches\nFailure\nSuccess\nPolicy \nChoice \nRequests\nProcess \nReservation\nPolicy \nChoice \nEvaluate Results\nServe\nr\nUsers\nPolicy\nGenerator\nServices\n \nFig 1 Framework Architecture \nB. Service Reservation \nA service is the basic unit of functionality in service oriented \ncomputing, it is self-described, can be discovered and \nservices can be joined into larger groups called composite \nservices. We define a service as follows: \nDEFINITION 1 (Service) \nA service is defined as a 3-tuple ( , , )S I O Q , where \nI represents the input ports of a service;  \nO represents the output ports of the service;  \nQ represents the quality constraints of service; \nService reservation (SR) is fundamental to process \nreservation and involves three aspects: service discovery, \nservice matching and marking. SR is defined as follows: \nDEFINITION 2 (Service Reservation)  \nSR is defined as a tupleSR(\uf065, R),where \n\uf065 is a set of services(S1(I1,O1,Q1), \u2026.Sn(In,On,Qn) ) \nR is a set of the same cardinality with R = {0, 1}\nn\n, \nWhere 1 denotes that the service has been marked. \n \nC. Process Reservation \nProcess reservation ensures that all services needed for a \nprocess are reserved \u2013 trying to optimize on QoS attributes. \nProcess reservation makes use of policies capturing the \nuser\u2019s flexibility. The policy reservation process uses the \nresults from service reservation, but with the possibility of \nadjusting these and will ultimately commit to a set of \nservices. \nDEFINITION3 (Process Reservation) \nProcess Reservation (PR) is defined as a 3-tuple \n( , , )sr pPR C R\uf065 , where \nC represents the composition workflow; \n\uf065sr represents the service set after SR(each service has an \nSR mark); \nRP represent a matrix with pair wise dependencies \nbetween services, with each entry r \uf0ce{Substitution, \nContains, adviceTo, Prerequisite, Replace, Exclude}; \n \nThe rules for process reservation are expressed in terms of \nkeywords showing relationships between services. The \nrelationships can be calculated using semantic distance [2]. \nWe need to consider two different situations with regard \nto the number of users. (1) For a limited numbers of users, \nwe can assume that there are sufficient service resources \navailable, so we will try to find best reservation for a user. \nOur method considers service relationships as defined earlier. \nThe method searches for the services that fulfill the \nworkflow and ensure the best QoS. (2) For an unlimited \nnumber of users, we cannot assure the best choice of services \nfor all users because there might be a shortfall of resources. \nA policy-based approach that allows users to express their \ndemands for the process reservation allows to optimize \nbetween best service and best utilization rate of service \nresources. There are three types of policy: (1) ordinary \npolicies with a standard reservation cost and presenting a \nfixed solution, (2) flexible policies allowing users to express \nthat they are flexible on certain aspects, encouraged by a \ndiscount, and (3) picky policies allowing the user to pay \nextra for getting a higher priority in a reservation to ensure \nthat he gets exactly what he asks. \nIII. EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATIONS \nBased on the PR architecture, we implemented a service \noriented reservation simulation for the travel process. We \nconsider 3 QoS attributes: cost, response time and \nthroughput. There are 10 services to reserve one-way airline \ntickets, 10 hotel  reservation services and 4 sightseeing tour \noperators. Prices of service instances are randomly generated \nwithin boundary intervals as shown in Table 1. When there \nexists a \u201csubstitution\u201d relation among services, the composite \nQoS data is improved by 20 percent. The \u201cadviceTo\u201d leads \nto a 30% discount and the \u201cExclude\u201d comes with unlimited \npremium cost. \nTABLE I.  ATTRIBUTES OF SIGHTSEEING TICKET ORDERING PROCESS  \nService No of Instances Price range \nAirline Ticket 10 600~800 \nHotel Booking  10 300-400 \nSightseeing Ticket 4 300-400 \nReturn Ticket 10 600~800 \n \nWe compare the results gained to those of a standard \nreservation approach. The metrics for comparison are the \naverage reservation cost, the success rate and the resources \nutilization of the reservation. We found that a \u201cBPSR\u201d \nreservation improves vendor\u2019s profits and customers\u2019 \nsatisfaction. For example, Fig 2 presents the average cost of \nthe process, with error bars along the curve of the BPSR \napproach. The results show that the average cost of process \nreservation considering the relationships of services \ndecreases with an increase in the relationship between \nservices. \n  \nFig 2 Average cost of different relevance for limited users \nIV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we presented a process reservation method \n(BPSR) \u2013 both the concept of process reservation as well as \nthe method are novel contributions. This method is based on \na process reservation architecture that integrates service \ndifferentiation, service reservation, process reservation and \nQoS control. We focus on the reservation method for the \nprocess level. Compared with service reservation, process \nreservation considers all candidate services as part of a \nprocess as a whole, and gains a higher probability to make a \nsuccessful reservation. In future work we plan to explore \nidentification of process bottlenecks as this could hint at \nservice shortfalls and hence business opportunities. We will \nalso consider whether better QoS data prediction can be \nachieved using results such as [3]. \nREFERENCES \n[1] K. Miyashita, K. Masuda, F. Higashitani.
