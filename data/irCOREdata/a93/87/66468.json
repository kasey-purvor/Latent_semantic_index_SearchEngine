For a vortex living on a\ncritical Randall-Sundrum brane universe, we show that the induced gravita-\ntional field on the brane is identical to that of an (n\u22121)-dimensional vacuum\ndomain wall. We also describe how to set-up a nested Randall-Sundrum sce-\nnario using a flat critical vortex living on a subcritical (adS) brane universe.\nPACS numbers: 04.50.+h, 11.27.+d hep-th\/0104262\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\nThe old idea [1] that our universe might somehow be a \u2018defect\u2019 within a higher dimen-\nsional spacetime has recently acquired a new lease of life \u2013 mainly because of interest in\nunusual geometric resolutions of the hierarchy problem [2,3]. The basic idea is that our\nobservable four-dimensional universe is somehow a localised worldbrane in a higher dimen-\nsional spacetime, and therefore, unlike the standard Kaluza-Klein compactifications, physics\nis not averaged over these extra dimensions, but strongly localised on this braneworld. Al-\nthough the original models of Arkani-Hamed et. al. [2] did not consistently treat gravity by\nincluding the effect of the brane-universe itself (however see Sundrum [4] for a codimension 2\nresolution, and [5] for higher codimension) the feature of generating a hierarchy between the\ngravitational and other interactions via the volume factor (effective or real) of the internal\nextra dimensions was nevertheless an important idea. The Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario\non the other hand, was fully gravitationally consistent, and saw our universe as a domain\nwall (or walls) sitting at the edge of a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. The ad-\nvantage of having a bulk adS spacetime is that although the extra dimension is infinite, its\nvolume is finite, and therefore it gives a finite contribution to the four-dimensional Planck\nscale.\nThe interesting feature of the RS scenario, and the one which makes it a viable brane-\nuniverse model, is that is that gravity on the domain wall is precisely Einstein gravity at\nlow energies, i.e.,\nRab \u2212 1\n2\nRgab = 8piGTab (1)\nthis has been shown perturbatively [3,6], but so far, non-perturbative gravitational solutions\nhave been thinner on the ground. Essentially they fall into one of three categories: Cosmo-\nlogical solutions [7\u20139], \u2018zero-mode\u2019 solutions which are translationally invariant orthogonal\nto the brane [10], and gravitational wave solutions [11]. All of these generically contain\nsome sort of singularity e.g. the cosmological solutions tend to have initial or final singu-\nlarities, and some, such as the zero mode Schwarzschild black string solution, are unstable\n[12]. A non-perturbative solution such as a black hole bound to the brane for example\nrequires a five-dimensional C-metric, which is so far unforthcoming. (See [13] for a lower,\n3+1, dimensional analogue.)\nThere is another way however, in which we could examine non-perturbative solutions\nwithout use of the C-metric, and that is by putting an extended source on the brane. At the\nlinearized level, a cosmic string in the RS braneworld (a source of codimension 3) exhibits\ndeviations from the pure 4-dimensional Einstein gravity [14], therefore one might expect\nthat if nonperturbative exact solutions can be found, they would provide a way in which to\nexplore deviations from Einstein gravity on the braneworld.\nIn order to explore this issue, in this paper we focus instead on a cosmic \u201cdomain wall\u201d\nliving entirely within, and totally localised upon, the brane universe. From the higher\ndimensional perspective, such a configuration is that of a vortex (by which we mean a\ncodimension 2 object, rather than some solitonic solution of a field theory) lying totally\nwithin the wall which constitutes the brane universe. This configuration turns out to be\ndirectly and completely integrable, and represents a genuinely fully localised \u2018intersection\u2019\nof the two \u2018branes\u2019. In the same way as one can view the RS scenario as a limit of a thick\ndomain wall [15], one can view this solution as a zero-thickness limit of a nested topological\n2\ndefect [16], which can occur when one has condensates of other fields in the presence of a\ntopological domain wall background, poetically called a domain ribbon.\nObviously the first step is to derive such a solution and its global spacetime structure,\nwhich we do presently, but once we have this solution, we can use it to explore the question\nof the (non-perturbative) gravitational field on the brane. Surprisingly perhaps, this turns\nout to look very much the same as if we had been ignorant of the bulk, and simply computed\nthe gravitational field of our \u201cdomain wall\u201d using the appropriate Einstein gravity in one\ndimension less. This shows that at least for these highly symmetric setups, the gravitational\ninteraction on the brane universe is Einsteinian in nature and for the critical RS universe is\nproven to be Einstein even at the non-perturbative level.\nTo start off, note that the gravitational field of a vortex-wall will have dependence on only\ntwo spacetime coordinates, r and z say, with z roughly representing the direction orthogonal\nto the domain wall representing our brane universe, and r the direction orthogonal to the\nvortex or domain ribbon within our brane universe. We therefore expect that, schematically,\nthe energy-momentum tensor of the system will have the form:\nTab = \u03c3hab\n\u03b4(z)\u221a\ngzz\n+ \u00b5\u03b3ab\n\u03b4(z)\u03b4(r)\u221a\ngzzgrr\n(2)\nwhere hab is the induced metric on the brane universe, and \u03b3ab the induced metric on the\nvortex. The most general metric consistent with these symmetries can (generalizing [9]) in\nn-dimensions be reduced to the form\nds2 = A\n2\n(n\u22122)dx2\u03ba \u2212 e2\u03bdA\u2212\n(n\u22123)\n(n\u22122) (dr2 + dz2) (3)\nwhere dx2\u03ba represents the \u2018unit\u2019 metric on a constant curvature spacetime (\u03ba = 0 corresponds\nto an (n \u2212 2)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, \u03ba = \u00b11 to (n \u2212 2)-dimensional de-Sitter\nand anti-de Sitter spacetimes), and the brane universe sits at z = 0, the vortex at r = z = 0.\nThis is basically a double analytic continuation of the cosmological metric in [9], where it\nis the time translation symmetry \u2202t which is broken, rather than \u2202r. The key result of that\npaper needed here was to show that the conformal symmetry of the t, z plane meant that the\ngravity equations were completely integrable in the bulk, and the brane universe was simply\na boundary (T (\u03c4), Z(\u03c4)) of that bulk (identified with another boundary of another general\nbulk). The dynamical equations of the embedding of the boundary reduced to pseudo-\ncosmological equations for Z(\u03c4). We may therefore use the results of [9] (appropriately\nmodified) to deduce that our solution must be a section, (R(\u03b6), Z(\u03b6)) of the general bulk\nmetric\nds2 = Z2dx2\u03ba \u2212 h(Z)dR2 \u2212\ndZ2\nh(Z)\n(4)\nwhere dx2\u03ba is now a constant curvature Lorentzian spacetime, and in general the function h\nis\nh(Z) = k2nZ\n2 + \u03ba +\nc\nZ(n\u22123)\n(5)\nwhere k2n = \u22122\u039b\/(n\u2212 1)(n\u2212 2). If c > 0, the metric becomes singular at the adS horizon,\nZ = 0. However, if c < 0, the metric is analogous to a euclidean black hole, and R becomes\nan angular coordinate \u2013 the spacetime closing off before the adS horizon.\n3\nFor simplicity, we will assume our brane universe is Z2 symmetric (i.e., spacetime is\nreflection symmetric around the wall) and that the integration constant, c, vanishes. This\ngives the equations of motion for the source (2) as\nZ \u20322(\u03b6) =\n(\nk2n \u2212 \u03c32n\n)\nZ2 + \u03ba (6a)\nZ \u2032\u2032(\u03b6) =\n(\nk2n \u2212 \u03c32n\n)\nZ \u2212 \u00b5n\n2\n\u03c3nZ\u03b4(\u03b6) (6b)\nR\u2032(\u03b6) =\n\u03c3nZ\n(k2nZ\n2 + \u03ba)\n(6c)\nwhere \u03c3n = 8piGn\u03c3\/2(n\u2212 2), and \u00b5n = 8piGn\u00b5. For example, the Randall-Sundrum domain\nwall (in n-dimensions) is given by setting \u03ba = \u00b5 = 0 (flat, no vortex) and \u03c3n = kn. The bulk\nmetric is then\nds2 = Z2(dt2 \u2212 dx2i \u2212 k2ndR2)\u2212\ndZ2\nk2nZ\n2\n(7)\nand we have the solution Z = Z0 a constant, and kR = \u03b6\/Z0. Letting Z0 = 1, and\nZ = e\u2212knz gives the usual RS coordinates. Replacing the Minkowski metric (in brackets) by\nan arbitrary (n\u2212 1)-dimensional metric gives the usual relation between Newton\u2019s constant\nin n and n\u2212 1 dimensions for the RS universe:\nGn\u22121 =\n(n\u2212 3)\n2\nknGn =\n(n\u2212 3)\n2\n\u03c3nGn (8)\na relationship confirmed by the perturbative analysis of [3,6].\nIn general, the Z-equation (6a) can be integrated away from R = 0 to give\nZ =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1\n2\n\u221a\na\n[\ne\u00b1\n\u221a\na(\u03b6\u2212\u03b60) \u2212 \u03bae\u2213\u221aa(\u03b6\u2212\u03b60)\n]\na > 0\nZ0 \u00b1 \u03ba\u03b6 a = 0, \u03ba = 0, 1\n1\u221a\n|a| cos\n\u221a\n|a|(\u00b1\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b60) a < 0, \u03ba = 1 only\n(9)\nwhere a = k2n\u2212\u03c32n, which is zero for a critical wall, and is positive (negative) for a sub (super)\ncritical wall respectively. In the absence of the vortex, a critical wall is one with a Minkowski\ninduced metric, and is the original RS scenario [3]; a supercritical wall is one which has a\nde-Sitter induced metric, and can be regarded as an inflating cosmology [8]; whereas the\nsubcritical wall has an adS induced metric, and has only recently been considered from the\nphenomenological point of view [17].\nSince we are interested in having a domain ribbon on our brane universe, we require\nsolutions with nonzero \u00b5n, and hence a discontinuity in Z\n\u2032. To achieve this, we simply patch\ntogether different branches of the solutions (9) for \u03b6 > 0 and \u03b6 < 0; the R-coordinate is\ngiven by integrating (6c).\nFrom (9) we see that critical and supercritical walls can only support a vortex if \u03ba = 1,\ni.e., if the induced metric on the vortex itself is a de-Sitter universe. A subcritical wall\non the other hand can support all induced geometries on the vortex. To investigate strong\nbrane gravity, we focus on two specific solutions: A domain ribbon in a Randall-Sundrum\n(critical) wall; and a \u201cnested RS scenario\u201d, i.e., a flat Minkowski domain ribbon living on\n4\na Karch-Randall (KR) subcritical adS domain wall. If the induced gravity on the brane is\nindeed Einstein gravity, then we would expect the induced metric on the braneworld to be\nthat of a vacuum domain wall and the Randall-Sundrum metric respectively. In the latter\ncase we would also expect the (n\u2212 2)-dimensional domain ribbon to have its own localised\ngraviton zero-mode. We now demonstrate this for each example in turn.\nThe Randall-Sundrum universe is a critical domain wall in adS spacetime, i.e., it satisfies\nthe relation \u03c3n = kn. This means that a domain ribbon on this wall must have \u03ba = 1, i.e.,\na \u2018spherical\u2019 spatial geometry. The full spacetime is therefore the region Z < Z(\u03b6):\nZ =\n4\n\u00b5nkn\n\u2212 |\u03b6 | (10a)\nknR = \u221312 ln\n[\n\u00b52n + (4\u2212 kn\u00b5n|\u03b6 |)2\n\u00b52n + 16\n]\n(10b)\nof the bulk (4) with \u03ba = 1. At first sight neither the trajectory nor bulk looks like the\noriginal RS scenario, however, the coordinate transformation\nknu = e\nknR\/\n\u221a\n1 + k2nZ\n2 (11a)\n(t\u02dc, x\u02dc) = knuZ(sinh t, cosh t nn\u22122) (11b)\n(where nn\u22122 is the unit vector in (n\u2212 2) dimensions) gives\nds2 =\n1\nk2nu\n2\n[\ndt\u02dc2 \u2212 dx\u02dc2 \u2212 du2\n]\n(12)\ni.e., the familiar planar adS metric in conformal coordinates. The trajectory (10) then\nbecomes \uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\nu = u0 =\n\u00b5n\nkn\n\u221a\n16+\u00b52\nn\n\u03b6 < 0\nx\u02dc2 \u2212 t\u02dc2 +\n(\nu\u2212 1\n2k2\nn\nu0\n)2\n= 1\n4k4\nn\nu20\n\u03b6 > 0\n(13)\nthe change of coordinates means that the trajectory is no longer manifestly Z2 symmetric,\nhowever, the \u03b6 < 0 branch now becomes a subset of the RS planar domain wall, specifically,\nthe interior of the hyperboloid\nx\u02dc2 \u2212 t\u02dc2\nk2nu\n2\n0\n=\n16\nk2n\u00b5\n2\nn\n= [2piGn\u22121\u00b5]\n\u22122 (14)\n(using (8)). However, recall that the global spacetime structure of a vacuum domain wall\nis that of two identified copies of the interior of a hyperboloid in Minkowski spacetime of\nproper radius 1\/2piGn\u22121\u00b5, [18], therefore (14) corresponds identically with what we would\nexpect from (n \u2212 1)-dimensional Einstein gravity. The \u03b6 > 0 branch is a hyperboloid in\nthe bulk centered on u = 1\/2k2nu0 with comoving radius 1\/2k\n2\nnu0. As \u00b5 increases, more\nand more of the hyperboloid is removed, with the spacetime \u2018disappearing\u2019 only as \u00b5\u2192\u221e.\nInterestingly, while this is par for the course for a domain wall, it is completely different to\nthe behaviour one would expect from a vortex.\nWe can easily find the induced metric on the brane universe\n5\nds2n\u22121 =\n(\n1\u2212 \u00b5nkn|\u03b6 |\n4\n)2 \uf8ee\uf8f0dt\u02c62 \u2212\n(\n4\n\u00b5nkn\n)2\ncosh2\n\u00b5nknt\u02c6\n4\nd\u21262II\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\u2212 d\u03b62 (15)\nwhere t\u02c6 = 4t\/\u00b5nkn. This is precisely the metric of a self-gravitating domain wall of tension\n\u00b5 in (n\u22121)-dimensional Einstein gravity written in Gaussian Normal coordinates [19]. This\ncan be seen from (8) and the Israel equations in (n\u2212 1)-dimensions for a wall of tension \u00b5:\n\u2206Kab = \u22128piGn\u22121\u00b5\n(n\u2212 3) hab = \u2212\nkn\u00b5n\n2\nhab (16)\nwhich is clearly the correct expression for the jump in extrinsic curvature at \u03b6 = 0 in (15).\nAn interesting variation on this theme is to consider a sub-critical instead of critical\nbrane universe. A subcritical brane universe is one for which the tension of the brane is not\nsufficient to cancel the negative bulk cosmological constant, |\u039b|, and for which the \u2018effective\u2019\ncosmological constant on the brane, \u22122\u03bb = (n\u22122)(n\u22123)(k2n\u2212\u03c32n), is still negative. From the\npoint of view of an observer living on the brane, the (n\u2212 1)-dimensional universe is adSn\u22121,\nand a \u201cdomain wall\u201d (i.e., ribbon) in their universe could then be an (n \u2212 1)-dimensional\nRandall-Sundrum scenario i.e., an (n \u2212 2)-dimensional Minkowski universe. Therefore, to\nset up this nested RS scenario, we look for a planar domain ribbon (which we expect to obey\nsome sort of \u2018criticality\u2019 condition analogous to \u03c3n = kn for the original RS wall) within a\nsubcritical brane-world, i.e., a \u03ba = 0 solution from (9). Defining k2n\u22121 = k\n2\nn \u2212 \u03c32n,\nZ = Z0e\n\u2212kn\u22121|\u03b6| R = \u00b1 4\nk2n\u00b5n\n(\nZ\u22121 \u2212 Z\u221210\n)\n(17)\nwhere \u00b5n = 4kn\u22121\/\u03c3n. Rewriting this in terms of conformal coordinates gives\nR = \u00b1 4\n\u00b5n\n(u\u2212 u0) (18)\nEach branch of this trajectory is a KR wall, which, if it were not for the vortex at (u0, 0)\nwould reach the adS boundary at R = \u22134u0\/\u00b5n.\nThe induced metric on the braneworld\ndsn\u22121 = Z20e\n\u22122kn\u22121|\u03b6|[dt2 \u2212 dx2i ]\u2212 d\u03b62 (19)\nis that of an RS universe. However, the RS universe has a strict \u2018criticality\u2019 relation between\nthe tension of the brane and the bulk cosmological constant. Here, we have\nkn\u22121 = 2piGn\u03c3n\u00b5 =\n4piGn\u22121\u00b5\n(n\u2212 3) (20)\n(using (8) in terms of \u03c3n rather than kn) which is precisely the RS criticality condition\n\u03c3n = 4piGn\u03c3\/(n\u2212 2) = kn adjusted for one dimension less.\nTherefore, provided we identify the n and (n\u2212 1)-dimensional Newton\u2019s constants using\nthe tension of the wall, we have found that the induced gravity of the domain ribbon agrees\nprecisely with that of an (n\u22121)-dimensional gravitating domain wall (either with or without\ninduced cosmological constant) even at the non-perturbative level.\n6\nNaturally, it would be interesting to know the full tensor structure of gravity, both on the\ndomain wall braneworld, as well as on the lower-dimensional ribbon world. A full analysis\nof the graviton propagator is rather involved, not only because the domain wall braneworld\nnow has a nontrivial trajectory through the adS bulk (which can in any case be remedied by\na judicious \u2013 Gaussian Normal \u2013 choice of gauge), but because this trajectory now contains\na \u2018kink\u2019 \u2013 the vortex \u2013 and therefore no longer respects the bulk symmetries, thus making a\nsimple eigenfunction expansion of the operator impossible with respect to the usual bases.\nHowever, it is easy to show that at least the vortex worldvolume does have something akin to\nthe localized zero mode of the RS braneworld. To do this, one can either perform the usual\nperturbation analysis around the adS background with the relevant boundary (in which case\nvery little changes from the original analysis of Randall and Sundrum), or one can simply\nreplace the flat metric in the canonical bulk form by a general Einstein metric depending\nonly on the vortex worldvolume coordinates:\nds2 = Z2g\u00b5\u03bd(x)dx\n\u00b5dx\u03bd \u2212 k2nZ2dR2 \u2212\ndZ2\nk2nZ\n2\n(21)\nInterestingly however, integrating out the Einstein action for this zero mode now gives\nGn\u22122 =\n(n\u2212 3)(n\u2212 4)\n4\nk2n\n\u03c32n\nGnkn\u22121\u03c3n (22)\nwhich has a discrepancy of k2n\/\u03c3\n2\nn over what might have been expected from (8). Clearly a\nmore detailed analysis is required.\nFinally, one can envisage more complicated braneworld domain ribbon configurations\nthan the ones described here. The general scenario of Randall and Sundrum has of course\nbeen extended to obtain a plethora of brane universe models many of which contain negative\ntension walls. The general approach described here can be modified to allow for negative\ntension walls, as well as patching between spacetimes with different cosmological constants,\nalthough the nontrivial trajectories induced by the presence of the vortex will, in general,\nmean that either a \u201cmirror\u201d vortex must be introduced on the negative tension brane, or\nthe positive tension brane must match to the negative tension brane across the vortex. One\nsuspects however, that the more baroque the model, the less stable or useful it is likely to\nbe.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Filipe Bonjour, Ian Davies, Roberto Emparan, James Gregory,\nKaren Lovis, Davina Page and Simon Ross for useful discussions.
