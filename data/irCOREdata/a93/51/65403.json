Introduction \nTrypanosoma brucei species are protozoan parasites of the order Kinetoplastidae and \nthe etiological agents of both human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, sleeping sickness), \nand diseases of economically important animals (e.g. nagana in cattle) [1]. These \ndiseases are endemic in much of sub-Saharan Africa, with HAT causing a burden of \napproximately 1.6 million disability adjusted life years (http:\/\/www.who.int\/tdr\/). This \ndistribution across some of the most under developed regions of the world is coupled \nwith a paucity of effective therapies, with those available being either too expensive (e.g. \neflornithine) or exhibiting catastrophic side-effects (e.g. melarsoprol). Together with the \nleishmaniases (caused by the related Leishmania species) HAT has been described as \nan emerging or uncontrolled disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new, \nvalidated drug targets and anti-HAT compounds to combat a disease causing in excess \nof 50,000 deaths per annum [2]. \nSphingolipids are a diverse group of amphipathic lipids that perform essential functions \nin eukaryotes. For example, the unmodified sphingolipid ceramide acts as a secondary \nsignalling molecule [3] and more complex species are implicated in the formation and \nfunction of signal transduction complexes [4, 5]. The primary phosphosphingolipid \nspecies in mammalian species, including humans, is sphingomyelin (SM). SM is formed \nby the transfer of the phosphorylcholine head group from phospholipid \nphosphatidylcholine (PC) to ceramide, a reaction catalyzed by SM synthase [6]. In \ncontrast fungi, plants and at least some protozoa produce inositol phosphorylceramide \n(IPC) as their primary phosphosphingolipid [7]. In these organisms IPC synthase \ncatalyzes the transfer of phosphorylinositol from phosphatidylinositol (PI) to ceramide [8-\n 5 \n10]. IPC synthase has long been established and studied as a target for novel anti-\nfungals [11, 12]. More recently this enzyme has come under scrutiny as a potential \ntarget for anti-protozoals [13]. With the recent identification and characterization of the \nLeishmania IPC synthase (LmIPCS; [10]) it has become possible both to validate this \nprotozoan activity as a drug target and, furthermore, begin to investigate potential \ninhibitors, including those known to act against the fungal IPC synthase. Four closely \nrelated orthologues of LmIPCS are apparent in the T. brucei database [10], and mass \nspectrometry of isolated fractions has revealed that whilst the predominant \nphosphosphingolipid in pathogenic bloodstream form parasites is SM [14]; insect stage, \nprocyclic T. brucei also contain IPC [15].  \nHere we describe the characterization of the African trypanosome, T. brucei, \nsphingolipid synthase 4 (TbSLS4) which demonstrates itself to be a novel bi-functional \nenzyme with the ability to catalyze the biosynthesis of both IPC and SM, thus reflecting \nthe sphingolipid profile of the parasite. Importantly, the IPC synthase activity of TbSLS4 \nis acutely sensitive to the well characterized specific fungal inhibitor aureobasidin A [11, \n12] and pathogenic bloodstream form T. brucei are rapidly killed at sub-micromolar \nconcentrations of this drug. Furthermore, down-regulation of TbSLS1-4 using inhibition \nRNA (RNAi) in bloodstream form parasites demonstrated that the enzyme activity is \nessential for growth thus validating it as a target for the development of new anti-HAT \ntherapies.   \n 6 \n2. Materials and methods  \n2.1. Functional identification of the Trypanosoma brucei sphingolipid synthase \nA common, conserved AUG start codon was predicted for all 4 TbSLS isoforms by \nexamination of the genome sequence (www.genedb.org). Subsequently, TbSLS1 \n(Tb09211.1030) and TbSLS4 (Tb09211.1000) were amplified with Pfu polymerase \n(Promega) from T.  brucei strain Lister 427 genomic DNA using primer pairs \n(homologous sequence underlined):  \nTbSLS1 - CCGGAATTCATGATTAGTTACCCTTTCTTCTCCC and \nCCGCTCGAGTCATACCTCGTTAGTTGATAC \nTbSLS4 \u2013 CCGGAATTCATGATTAGTTACCCTTTCTTCTCCC and \nCCGCTCGAGTCACACATACGCCCCACATTTAAAC; \nThe PCR products were subsequently cloned into the yeast expression vector pRS426 \nMET [16] to give pRS426 TbSLS1 and pRS426 TbSLS4. These, together with pRS426 \nAUR1, pRS426 human sphingomyelin synthase 1 and 2 (HsSMS1 and 2) and empty \nvector (pRS426), were used to transform the YPH499\u2013HIS\u2013GAL\u2013AUR1 S. cerevisiae \nstrain [10]. Transformants were selected on non-permissive SD medium (0.17% Bacto \nyeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulphate and 2% dextrose) or permissive SGR \nmedium (0.17% Bacto yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulphate, 4% galactose \nand 2% raffinose) containing the appropriate nutritional supplements at 30\u00b0C. \n 7 \n2.2. Metabolic labelling and analyses \nYeast were grown to exponential phase in SD or SGR as indicated and 2.5 OD600 units \nincubated in 1 ml of SD or SGR supplemented with 5 \u00b5M of NBD C6-ceramide \n(Invitrogen) conjugated to fat-depleted bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 120 \nminutes at 30\u00b0C. Yeast were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with \nphosphate buffered saline. Chloroform\/methanol (0.4 ml; 1:1 v\/v) was added and cells \nwere disintegrated with glass beads. The pellet was re-extracted with \nchloroform\/methanol\/water (10:10:3) and the lipid fraction isolated by phase separation. \nAfter drying in a rotavapor (Eppendorf Concentrator 5301) reaction products were re-\nsuspended in 20 \u00b5l of 10:10:3 and cell mass equivalents fractionated using HPTLC silica \nplates (Merck) and the eluent system chloroform:methanol:aqueous 0.25% KCl \n(55:45:10). Imaging and quantification was carried out using a FLA3000 scanner \n(Fujifilm) and AIDA Image Analyzer\u00ae software (version 1.3). Vero cells were labelled and \nprocessed for use as controls and standards as previously described [10]. \nSphingomyelinase (Bacillus cereus; Sigma Aldrich) was used to identify sphingomyelin \nin the NBD C6-ceramide lipids extracted from the complemented yeast as previously \ndescribed [17]. Briefly, YPH499\u2013HIS\u2013GAL\u2013AUR1 S. cerevisiae complemented with \npRS426 TbSLS4 (in SD) or transformed with pRS426 HsSMS2 or empty vector (in \npermissive SGR, or for a limited period SD) were grown to exponential phase. After \nadjustment to an optical density of 0.5 OD600 in 5 ml of either SD or SGR, cells were \nlabelled for 16 hours with 2 \u00b5M of NBD C6-ceramide conjugated to fat-depleted bovine \nserum albumin as previously described [6]. Labelled lipid fractions from these were \nprepared and dried as above with 50 \u00b5g of sphingomyelin (Sigma Aldrich), and \n 8 \nresuspended, with sonication in a water bath, in 600 \u00b5l of 20 mM Tris-HCL (pH7.4), 10 \nmM MgCl2 and 0.05% (w\/v) Triton X-100. Subsequently, samples (300 \u00b5l) were \nincubated with or without 2 units of Bacillus Cereus sphingomyelinase (Sigma Aldrich) at \n37\u00b0C for 120 minutes. Equivalent lipid extracts were fractionated and analyzed as \nabove. \n2.3. In vitro assay of TbSLS4 activity \nMicrosomal membranes from exponentially growing YPH499\u2013HIS\u2013GAL\u2013AUR1 pRS426 \nTbSLS4, pRS426 LmIPCS or pRS426 AUR1 [10] were prepared as previously \ndescribed [18] and the isolated membrane fraction re-suspended in storage buffer (50 \nmM Tris\/HCl pH 7.4, 20% (v\/v) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2) with Complete\u00ae EDTA-free \nProtease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science) at a protein concentration of 10 \nmg\/ml. The microsomal membranes were subsequently washed in 2.5% CHAPS (w\/v; \nSigma Aldrich; 4 \u00b0C, 60 minutes), isolated by centrifugation (150000 g, 4 \u00b0C and 90 \nmin), re-suspended in storage buffer at 10 mg\/ml and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. \nThe assay mix contained 100 \u00b5M donor substrate (bovine liver PI, PC or PE, Avanti \nPolar Lipids), 10 \u00b5g of microsomes, 100 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 6 mg\/ml BSA and \n5 \u00b5M NBD C6-ceramide [19]. Following incubation at 30 \u00b0C for 60 minutes the reaction \nwas quenched by the addition of 150 \u00b5l of chloroform:methanol:water (10:10:3). After \nbiphasic separation the organic layer was removed, processed, quantified and analyzed \nas above.  \nFor inhibition experiments the reaction mix was pre-incubated for 30 minutes with \nappropriate quantities of aureobasidin A (Takara) before the addition of NBD C6-\nceramide.  \n 9 \n2.4. Parasite culture \nBloodstream form T. brucei strains Lister 427 and its engineered variant, Single Marker \nBloodstream form (SMB, T7RNAP::TETR::NEO; [20]) were maintained in vitro at 37\u00b0C \nwith 5% CO2 in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and, for SMB, 2.5 \u00b5g\/ml \nG418.  \n2.5. Inhibition RNA (RNAi) of TbSLS \nAn 165 base pair sequence fragment common to all four TbSLS open reading frames \nwas amplified from genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase and primer pair (homologous \nsequence underlined): CATAGATCTAGAGGTTCCATACACTGTG and  \nCATAGATCTAGACGAGAGGCAACGATGC \nThis PCR product was cloned into the RNAi vector p2T7 [21] and, following linearization, \n10 \u00b5g transfected into SMB T. brucei and transformants selected using 2 \u00b5g\/ml \nphleomycin (Sigma Aldrich). Following induction with 1 \u00b5g\/ml doxycycline cell growth \nwas determined at 24 hour intervals by light microscopy using an Improved Neubauer \nHaemocytometer. \n48 hours post-induction total RNA was isolated (RNeasy\uf8e8, Qiagen) and RT-PCR was \nperformed (SuperScript II, Invitrogen) using the primer pairs: \nTbSLS: AAACTGTACCTTCTTCACCG and CGAGAGGCAACGATGC; \nTb \u03b2 tubulin: GGAGCGCATCAATGTGTAC and CAGGCAGCAGGTGACGCCG \n2.6. T.  brucei susceptibility to aureobasidin A \nT. brucei Lister 427 were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of \naureobasidin A. Growth was analyzed at 24 hour intervals as above. \n 10 \n3. Results and discussion \n3.1. Identification and characterization of the T. brucei sphingolipid synthase \nFour tandem gene sequences (Tb09211.1030, Tb09.211.1020, Tb09.211.1010 and \nTb09.211.1000; here annotated TbSLS1-4 to reflect their 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 order) were previously \nidentified in the T. brucei genome database (www.genedb.org) as sequence orthologues \nof the inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (LmIPCS) from the related kinetoplastid \nparasite, Leishmania [10]. The predicted open reading frames encode 4 closely related \ntrans-membrane proteins with more than 90% identity and 94% similarity. Most variation \noccurs at the carboxy-termini, a region predicted to lie on the cytosolic side of the \nmembrane away from the active site at the Golgi lumen, with another variable domain \nclose to and within the second predicted trans-membrane domain [10]. One of the \npredicted T. brucei sphingolipid synthase isoforms (Tb09.211.1000; TbSLS4) was the \nfocus of this study. In addition, the isoform most distant from TbSLS4 with respect to the \ninternal variable domain (Tb09.211.1030; TbSLS1) was also subjected to preliminary \nanalyses.  \nThe auxotrophic mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, YPH499-HIS-GAL-AUR1, \nhas the essential AUR1 IPC synthase gene under the control of a galactose inducible \npromoter. Therefore it is unable to grow in the presence of the repressor glucose, a \nphenotype that is rescued by the ectopic expression of LmIPCS [10]. Similarly, TbSLS4 \nand TbSLS1 expression complemented the YPH499-HIS-GAL-AUR1 mutant yeast line \nindicating that they are also functional orthologues of the yeast AUR1 gene (figure 1). \nThe yeast IPC synthase (AUR1) also complemented this mutant line. Significantly, \nneither HsSMS1 nor HsSMS2 complemented the YPH499-HIS-GAL-AUR1 yeast (data \n 11 \nnot shown) indicating that sphingomyelin synthase activity alone is not sufficient to \nrescue the mutant. \nTo understand the function of the T. brucei sphingolipid synthase, the auxotrophic \nYPH499-HIS-GAL-AUR1 yeast cells complemented with either TbSLS4, TbSLS1 or \nyeast AUR1 were metabolically labelled with fluorescent NBD C6-ceramde, a substrate \nfor sphingolipid synthases, including those from the kinetoplastids [10]. Under the \nconditions described, the AUR1 complemented S. cerevisiae auxotrophic mutant \nsynthesized IPC as the only labelled product. In contrast, both TbSLS4 and TbSLS1 \ncomplemented mutant yeast were shown to synthesize two major labelled lipid species. \nOne of these co-migrated with SM, the other with IPC. The latter at levels equivalent to \nthose produced in the AUR1 complemented yeast (figure 2A). In addition, TbSLS4 \ncomplemented yeast synthesized a third species which co-migrated with an unknown \nlipid (X) produced by labelled mammalian cells (Vero). As a control YPH499-HIS-GAL-\nAUR1 cells harbouring an empty vector (pRS426) were cultured in both permissive \n(SGR) and non-permissive (SD) media. Both lines grew equivalently in both media for \n16 hours and for a further 8 hours after dilution to an optical density 0.3 OD600, and \nremained viable (by plating on permissive media, data not shown). Labelling of these \ndividing cells with NBD C6-ceramde in their respective media under the same conditions \nas above demonstrated that in non-permissive SD no labelled IPC is produced, \nindicating the down-regulation of AUR1p (figure 2B). \nTbSLS4 was chosen for further study due to the relative predominance of the SM-like \nspecies in the labelled complemented yeast. Unlike IPC, SM is known to be present in \nthe pathogenic bloodstream form of the parasite [14]. The labelled SM-like species (and \n 12 \nthe unknown X) proved to be susceptible to sphingomyelinase (which breaks down SM \ninto phosphorylcholine and ceramide) when lipid extracts were treated with this enzyme, \nthereby confirming its identity (figure 3A). In contrast the IPC produced was insensitive \nto this enzyme treatment. Extracts from the auxotrophic mutant expressing HsSMS2, \nwhich produce an equivalent quantity of labelled SM under permissive conditions (SGR), \nacted as a control for SMase activity.  \nTogether these data suggest that TbSLS4 is a novel bi-functional enzyme acting as both \na SM and an IPC synthase. This is consistent with previous analyses which \ndemonstrated that the parasite harbours both SM [14] and IPC phosphosphingolipids \n[15]. \n3.2. In vitro analyses of TbSLS4 activity \nTo further investigate the function of TbSLS4, microsomal material was isolated from the \nTbSLS4 and AUR1 complemented yeast as described and used in an in vitro assay \nutilising the common acceptor substrate NBD C6-ceramide and the candidate donor \nsubstrates bovine liver PI, PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE; a potential substrate \nfor ethanolamine phorphorylceramide synthesis [22]). Notably, when assayed, the yeast \nAUR1 crude microsomal material showed significant IPC synthase turnover, but \ndemonstrated little significant increase in this on the addition of the donor substrate PI. \nAs expected, no detectable SM synthesis was observed with or without the addition of \nPC (figure 4A). In order to clearly assign enzyme function this assay was refined \naccording to data obtained from the analysis of LmIPCS (Mina et al. in preparation). In \nbrief, microsomal fractions were washed with ice-cold 2.5% 3-[3-(cholamidopropyl) \ndimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS) to remove endogenous (i.e. yeast) \n 13 \nsubstrates. This facilitated analyses of the effect of adding exogenous substrate to the \nreaction \u2013 in this case the candidate donor substrates (PI, PC or PE) plus the known \nacceptor substrate NBD C6-ceramide. Without the addition of the donor substrate the \nCHAPS-washed AUR1 microsomes, compared to the crude unwashed sample, \ndemonstrated a relatively low level of IPC synthase turnover and, as expected no \nevidence of SM synthase function (figure 4A, Crude and Washed). Importantly, the \naddition of PI or PC had no discernable effect on enzyme turnover in the washed \nsample indicating that the yeast IPC synthase is either substrate specific (and unable to \nutilise bovine PI) or that the detergent treatment had disrupted the protein (figure 4A, +PI \nand +PC Washed). In contrast, assay of identically treated TbSLS4 microsomes showed \nthat the addition of PI led to a large (more than 12-fold) increase in the formation of IPC \n(figure 4B, +PI). This demonstrated that TbSLS4 functions as an IPC synthase, an \nactivity not attributable to background AUR1 expression. \nSurprisingly given the identification of SM as a TbSLS4 product above (figure 3A), \nbovine PC \u2013 a potential donor substrate for a SM synthase - had no significant effect on \nenzyme activity (figure 4B, +PC). The addition of PE was similarly ineffectual (figure 4B, \n+PE).  However, when PC or PE were added simultaneously as molar equivalents with \nPI to the assay system, the quantity of IPC produced decreased 4 and 2-fold \nrespectively. This suggested that both PC and PE bind competitively with PI to the same \nregion of the enzyme (figure 4B, +PI+PC and +PI+PE). \nTaken together these results indicate that TbSLS4 functions as an IPC synthase but \nalso binds PC (and PE) and can participate in the synthesis of SM. The lack of in vitro \nSM synthase activity in the presence of exogenous PC is surprising and may relate to \n 14 \nsubstrate specificity (see yeast AUR1 and bovine PI, figure 4A, Washed). One possibility \nis that TbSLS4, in this assay, is unable to utilize bovine liver PC. This donor substrate is \na mixed natural product with predominantly C36:2 PC. In contrast, S. cerevisiae, where \nboth TbSLS4 and TbSLS1 function as SM synthases, predominantly possesses C32:2 \nand C34:2 PC [23]. Perhaps TbSLS favours these relatively short acyl groups? \nHowever, T. brucei procyclic and bloodstream forms harbour significant quantities of \nC36, C38 and C40 PC species [14, 24, 25], indicating that any substrate selectivity is \nperhaps due more subtle structural differences. In support of this, although TbSLS4 can \nutilise bovine liver PI (predominantly C38:4) efficiently as a substrate for IPC synthesis, \nprocyclic form parasites (known to synthesize IPC [15]) harbour only trace levels of the \nC38:4 PI [14]. \n3.3. Inhibition of TbSLS4 using a known anti-fungal agent \nIPC synthase is a recognized target for anti-fungal drugs and the natural product \naureobasidin A is a widely utilized and specific experimental inhibitor [26]. This drug also \nspecifically inhibits the activity of Leishmania LmIPCS, a TbSLS orthologue, albeit at a \nconcentration several orders of magnitude higher than those for the S. cerevisiae \nenzyme [10].  \nTo establish the efficacy of aureobasidin A against the T. brucei enzyme the previously \ndescribed in vitro assay was employed using CHAPS-washed TbSLS4 microsomes with \nNBD C6-ceramide and bovine PI as receptor and donor substrates respectively. As a \ncontrol identically prepared LmIPCS microsomes were assayed in the same manner. \nGiven the inactivity of the yeast enzyme in this assay system it was not possible to \ninclude this as a further control. The synthesis of labelled IPC was used as a measure of \n 15 \nIPC synthase turnover. From this assay it was evident that the T. brucei enzyme is \nacutely sensitive to the drug (figure 5A). Following reanalysis of the linear portion of the \ncurve (0 \u2013 0.5 nM aureobasidin A), the turnover was calculated to be 50% inhibited \n(IC50) by 0.42 nM aureobasidin A. TbSLS4 turnover was undetectable at a concentration \nof 50 nm aureobasidin A. In contrast, the IC50 for LmIPCS inhibition by aureobasidin A \nwas more than 200,000 times higher, with precipitation of the drug at concentrations \nabove 100 \u00b5M (figure 5B) preventing the determination of an absolute value. \n3.4. Validation of TbSLS as a target of anti-protozoals \nUsing a sequence fragment common to all four TbSLS isoforms an RNAi construct was \nprepared in the p2T7 vector [21] and used to specifically inhibit TbSLS expression in \ncultured bloodstream form T. brucei (SMB). Non-induced TbSLS RNAi cells grew in a \nsimilar manner to control SMB parasites carrying empty vector with or without the \ndoxycycline. In contrast, doxycycline induction of TbSLS RNAi saw the parasites cease \ndivision and led to some cell death as scored by light microscopy. RT-PCR, using \u03b2 \ntubulin as a control, confirmed the specificity of the TbSLS mRNA inhibition (figure 6).  \nThis genetic approach validated TbSLS as an essential enzyme for pathogenic \nbloodstream form parasite growth. Given the in vitro data shown above in which \naureobasidin A was demonstrated to inhibit TbSLS4, the efficacy of this natural \ncompound was tested against cultured bloodstream form T.  brucei (Lister 427; figure 7). \nWhen the concentration of aureobasidin A was 1 \u00b5M cell growth was completely \ninhibited and the parasites were scored as dead by light microscopy after 24 hours. The \nEC50 of aureobasidin A against the parasites was estimated from these data as being \n 16 \nbelow 250 nM. However, it is the trypanocidal activity of this compound at higher \nconcentrations that is of most significance. \n 17 \n3.5. Summary \nPrevious studies using pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the first step in \nsphingolipid biosynthesis, catalysed by serine palmitoyltransferase, showed that this \npathway is essential for the viability of both bloodstream and procyclic forms of T. brucei \n[17, 27]. This is in contrast to the related protozoan parasite Leishmania major where \nthis enzyme, though essential for sphingolipid biosynthesis, is non-essential for both \nviability and pathogenesis [28, 29]. These studies indicate that sphingolipid biosynthesis \ncould be a viable drug target in the African trypanosomes. \nThe sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway is largely conserved across the Eukaryota. \nHowever, whilst animal cells synthesize the phosphosphingolipid SM, yeast and plants, \nplus at least some protozoa, produce IPC [7]. The IPC synthase of pathogenic fungi has \nlong been validated and studied as a drug target [11], and the recent identification of a \nfunctional orthologue in the protozoan Kinetoplastids, the causative agents of several \nso-called neglected diseases, has led to its consideration as a target for anti-protozoal \nagents [10]. In this study we confirm that 2 of the 4 closely related T. brucei orthologues \n(TbSLS4 and 1) of the Leishmania IPC synthase (LmIPCS) are also functional \northologues of the S. cerevisiae enzyme encoded by AUR1. However surprisingly, \nunlike the Leishmania enzyme (and AUR1) TbSLS4 and 1 are able to catalyze the \nsynthesis of both IPC and SM, which reflects the known sphingolipid content of T. brucei \ncells [15]. In an in vitro assay system utilizing TbSLS4 complemented AUR1 mutant \nyeast microsomes, it was demonstrated that the T. brucei enzyme was able to function \nas an IPC synthase. Although PC (and PE) was demonstrated to be a competitive \nbinder with respect to PI, SM synthase activity could not be constituted possibly due to \n 18 \nsome level of specificity with respect to the donor substrate PC. Clearly, substrate \nspecificity and the mechanism of action of TbSLS4 warrant further investigation to \ndisentangle the detected IPC synthase function from the apparent SM synthase activity. \nDetermination of the kinetic parameters of TbSLS4 would facilitate this, for example with \nrespect to determining the binding constants for the apparent competitive IPC synthase \ninhibitors - PC and PE. In this respect it should be noted that the T. brucei enzyme is \nunlike its orthologues from the other kinetoplastid parasites where both the Leishmania \n(figure 5B) and T. cruzi enzymes (Casbon and Denny, unpublished) demonstrate only \nIPC synthase activity in the in vitro system employed here. It is also clearly important to \nfully analyse the other 3 TbSLS isoforms to determine their function. \nThe known yeast and fungal IPC synthase inhibitor, aureobasidin A, has previously \nbeen shown to be active against the related kinetoplast, Leishmania species, inhibiting \ngrowth, but not affecting viability, in culture [30]. However, it has been demonstrated that \nthe L. major IPC synthase is refractory to aureobasidin A (figure 5B) and that its affect \nagainst this species in culture is non-specific [28]. A similar situation has been observed \nwith respect to the causative agent of Chagas disease, T. cruzi [19]. In contrast, this \nstudy showed that aureobasidin A demonstrated a high level of efficacy against TbSLS4 \nturnover in vitro, with an IC50 of 0.42 nM. In light of these results demonstrating the \nability of a known inhibitor to affect enzyme activity, it was important to validate TbSLS \nas a potential target of anti-trypanosome drugs. Simultaneous RNAi of all four closely \nrelated isoforms of TbSLS demonstrated that this enzyme is essential for growth and so \nrepresents a new, much needed anti-protozoal target. Furthermore, aureobasidin A \n 19 \nproved highly effective and trypanocidal against cultured bloodstream form T. brucei, \nwith a sub-micromolar EC50. \nTogether these data raise the possibility of the discovery of a new generation of lead \ninhibitors directed against TbSLS, ultimately leading to novel drugs for the treatment of \nhuman African trypanosomiasis. \n 20 \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was funded by Biotechnology and Biological Research Council \n(BB\/D52396X\/1) and Royal Society (2005\/R1) grants to PWD and a British \nCouncil\/Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst Academic Research Collaboration \nAward to PWD and RTS.
