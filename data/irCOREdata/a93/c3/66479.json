INTRODUCTION\nThis paper aims to give a new and more precise deter-\nmination of the decay form factors of Bd;u;s mesons into\nlight vector mesons, i.e., \u0007, !, K\u0002, and \n; it is a continu-\nation of of our previous study of B decays into pseudosca-\nlar mesons [1]. The calculation uses the method of QCD\nsum rules on the light cone, which in the past has been\nrather successfully applied to various problems in heavy-\nmeson physics cf. Refs. [2]1; an outline of the method will\nbe given below. Our calculation improves on our previous\npaper [4] by\n(i) including B! ! form factors;\n(ii) including radiative corrections to 2-particle twist-3\ncontributions to one-loop accuracy;\n(iii) including a new parametrization of the dominant\nhadronic contributions (twist-2 distribution ampli-\ntudes);\n(iv) detailing the dependence of form factors on distri-\nbution amplitudes;\n(v) including a new parametrization of the dependence\nof the form factors on momentum transfer;\n(vi) including a careful analysis of the theoretical\nuncertainties.\nLike in Ref. [1], the motivation for this study is twofold and\nrelates to the overall aim of B physics to provide precision\ndeterminations of quark flavor mixing parameters in the\nstandard model. Quark flavor mixing is governed by the\nunitary CKM matrix which depends on four parameters:\nthree angles and one phase. The constraints from unitarity\ncan be visualized by the so-called unitarity triangles; the\none that is relevant for B physics is under intense experi-\nmental study. The over-determination of the sides and\nangles of this triangle from a multitude of processes will\nanswer the question whether there is new physics in flavor-\nchanging processes and where it manifests itself. One of\nthe sides of the unitarity triangles is given by the ratio of\nCKM matrix elements jVub=Vcbj. jVcbj is known to about\n2% accuracy from both inclusive and exclusive b! c\u2018\u0010\ntransitions [5], whereas the present error on jVubj is much\nlarger and around 15%. Its reduction requires an improve-\nment of experimental statistics, which is underway at the B\nfactories BABAR and Belle, but also and, in particular, an\nimprovement of the theoretical prediction for associated\nsemileptonic spectra and decay rates. This is one motiva-\ntion for our study of the B! \u0007 semileptonic decay form\nfactors A1, A2, V, which, in conjunction with alternative\ncalculations, hopefully from lattice, will help to reduce the\nuncertainty from exclusive semileptonic determinations of\njVubj. Secondly, form factors of general B! light meson\ntransitions also are needed as ingredients in the analysis of\nnonleptonic two-body B decays, e.g., B! \u0007\u0012, in the\nframework of QCD factorization [6]\u2014again with the ob-\njective to extract CKM parameters. One issue calling for\nparticular attention in this context is the effect of SU(3)\nbreaking, which enters both the form factors and the K\u0002\nand \n meson distribution amplitudes figuring in the facto-\nrization analysis. We would like to point out that the\nimplementation of SU(3) breaking in the light-cone sum\nrules approach to form factors is precisely the same as in\nQCD factorization and is encoded in the difference be-\ntween \u0007, !, K\u0002, and \n distribution amplitudes, so that the\nuse of form factors calculated from light-cone sum rules\ntogether with the corresponding meson distribution ampli-\ntudes in factorization formulas allows a unified and con-\ntrolled approach to the assessment of SU(3) breaking\neffects in nonleptonic B decays.\nAs we shall detail below, QCD sum rules on the light\ncone allow the calculation of form factors in a kinematic\nregime where the final state meson has large energy in the\nrest system of the decaying B, E\u0004 \bQCD. The physics\nunderlying B decays into light mesons at large momentum\ntransfer can be understood qualitatively in the framework\nof hard exclusive QCD processes, pioneered by Brodsky\n*Patricia.Ball@durham.ac.uk\n\u2020zwicky@physics.umn.edu\n1See also Ref. [3] for reviews.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 014029 (2005)\n1550-7998=2005=71(1)=014029(26)$23.00 014029-1 \uf6d9 2005 The American Physical Society\nand Lepage et al. [7]. The hard scale in B decays ismb and\none can show that to leading order in 1=mb the decay is\ndescribed by two different parton configurations: one\nwhere all quarks have large momenta and the momentum\ntransfer happens via the exchange of a hard gluon, the so-\ncalled hard-gluon exchange, and a second one where one\nquark is soft and does interact with the other partons only\nvia soft-gluon exchange\u2014the so-called soft or Feynman\nmechanism. The consistent treatment of both effects in a\nframework based on factorization, i.e., the clean separation\nof perturbatively calculable hard contributions from non-\nperturbative \u2018\u2018wave functions,\u2019\u2019 is highly nontrivial and has\nspurred the development of soft collinear effective theory\n(SCET), an effective field theory which aims to separate\nthe two relevant large mass scales mb and\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nmb\bQCD\nq\nin a\nsystematic way [8]. In this approach form factors can in-\ndeed be split into a calculable factorizable part which\nroughly corresponds to the hard-gluon exchange contribu-\ntions, and a nonfactorizable one, which includes the soft\ncontributions and cannot be calculated within the SCET\nframework [9,10]. Predictions obtained in this approach\nthen typically aim to eliminate the soft part and take\nthe form of relations between two or more form factors\nwhose difference is expressed in terms of factorizable\ncontributions.\nThe above discussion highlights the need for a calcula-\ntional method that allows numerical predictions while\ntreating both hard and soft contributions on the same foot-\ning. It is precisely QCD sum rules on the light cone\n(LCSRs) that accomplish this task. LCSRs can be viewed\nas an extension of the original method of QCD sum rules\ndevised by Shifman, Vainshtein, and Zakharov [11], which\nwas designed to determine properties of ground state had-\nrons at zero or low momentum transfer, to the regime of\nlarge momentum transfer. QCD sum rules combine the\nconcepts of operator product expansion, dispersive repre-\nsentations of correlation functions, and quark-hadron dual-\nity in an ingenious way that allows the calculation of the\nproperties of nonexcited hadron states with a very reason-\nable theoretical uncertainty. In the context of weak-decay\nform factors, the basic quantity is the correlation function\nof the weak current and a current with the quantum num-\nbers of the B meson, evaluated between the vacuum and a\nlight meson. For large (negative) virtualities of these cur-\nrents, the correlation function is, in coordinate space,\ndominated by distances close to the light cone and can be\ndiscussed in the framework of light-cone expansion. In\ncontrast to the short-distance expansion employed by con-\nventional QCD sum rules a` la Shifman, Vainshtein, and\nZakharov where nonperturbative effects are encoded in\nvacuum expectation values of local operators with vacuum\nquantum numbers, the condensates, LCSRs rely on the\nfactorization of the underlying correlation function into\ngenuinely nonperturbative and universal hadron distribu-\ntion amplitudes (DAs) \n which are convoluted with\nprocess-dependent amplitudes T. The latter are the ana-\nlogues of Wilson coefficients in the short-distance expan-\nsion and can be calculated in perturbation theory. The\nlight-cone expansion then reads, schematically:\ncorrelation function \u0005X\nn\nT\u0006n\u0007 \b\n\u0006n\u0007: (1)\nThe sum runs over contributions with increasing twist,\nlabeled by n, which are suppressed by increasing powers\nof, roughly speaking, the virtualities of the involved cur-\nrents. The same correlation function can, on the other hand,\nbe written as a dispersion relation, in the virtuality of the\ncurrent coupling to the B meson. Equating dispersion\nrepresentation and the light-cone expansion, and separat-\ning the B meson contribution from that of higher one- and\nmulti-particle states using quark-hadron duality, one ob-\ntains a relation for the form factor describing the decay\nB! light meson.\nA crucial question is the accuracy of light-cone sum\nrules. Like with most other methods, there are uncertainties\ninduced by external parameters like quark masses and\nhadronic parameters and intrinsic uncertainties induced\nby the approximations inherent in the method. As we shall\ndiscuss in Sec. IV, the total theoretical uncertainty for the\nform factors at q2 \t 0 is presently around 10%, including a\n7% irreducible systematic uncertainty.\nOur paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II we define all\nrelevant quantities, in particular, the meson distribution\namplitudes. In Sec. III we outline the calculation. In\nSec. IV we derive the sum rules and present numerical\nresults. Section V contains a summary and conclusions.\nDetailed expressions for distribution amplitudes, a break-\ndown of the light-cone sum rule results into different\ncontributions, and explicit formulas for the contributions\nof 3-particle states are given in the Appendices A, B, and\nC.\nII.

K\u0002,\nand Bs ! \n (with q \t u; d). The factor cV accounts for\nthe flavor content of particles: cV \t\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n2\np\nfor \u00070,! and cV \t\n1 otherwise.2\nThe currents in (2) and (4) contain both vector and axial-\nvector components. V and T1 correspond to the vector\ncomponents of the currents, and, as the B meson is a\npseudoscalar, to the axial-vector components of the matrix\nelements. A1;2 clearly correspond to the axial-vector com-\nponent of the V \u000b A current; the term in A3 \u000b A0 arises as\nthe contraction of (2) with \u000biq\u001a must agree with (6). As\nfor the penguin current, T2;3 correspond to the axial-vector\ncomponents of the current; there is no analogon to A0, as\nthe current vanishes upon contraction with q\u001a. As we shall\nsee in Sec.

The above conditions can be understood by\ndemanding that the exponential factor in (12) vary only\nslowly. The light-cone expansion is performed by integrat-\ning out the transverse and \u2018\u2018minus\u2019\u2019 degrees of freedom and\nleaving only the longitudinal momenta of the partons as\nrelevant degrees of freedom. The integration over trans-\nverse momenta is done up to a cutoff, \u001aIR, all momenta\nbelow which are included in a so-called hadron distribution\namplitude (DA) \n, whereas larger transverse momenta are\ncalculated in perturbation theory. The correlation function\nis hence decomposed, or factorized, into perturbative con-\ntributions T and nonperturbative contributions \n, which\nboth depend on the longitudinal parton momenta and the\nfactorization scale \u001aIR. If the vector meson is an effective\nquark-antiquark bound state, as is the case to leading order\nin the light-cone expansion, one can write the correspond-\ning longitudinal momenta as up and \u00061\u000b u\u0007p, where p is\nthe momentum of the meson and u a number between 0 and\n1. The schematic relation (1) can then be written in more\nexplicit form as\n\u0015\u0006q2; p2B\u0007 \t\nX\nn\nZ 1\n0\nduT\u0006n\u0007\u0006u; q2; p2B;\u001aIR\u0007\n\u0006n\u0007\u0006u;\u001aIR\u0007:\n(14)\nAs \u0015 itself is independent of the arbitrary scale \u001aIR, the\nscale dependence of T\u0006n\u0007 and \n\u0006n\u0007 must cancel each other.3\nIf \n\u0006n\u0007 describes the meson in a 2-parton state, it is called a\n2-particle DA; if it describes a 3-parton, i.e., quark-anti-\nquark-gluon state, it is called 3-particle DA. In the latter\ncase the integration over u gets replaced by an integration\nover two independent momentum fractions, say '1 and '2.\nEquation (14) is called a \u2018\u2018collinear\u2019\u2019 factorization formula,\nas the momenta of the partons in the meson are collinear\nwith its momentum. Any such factorization formula re-\nquires verification by explicit calculation; we will come\nback to that issue in the next section.\nLet us now define the distribution amplitudes to be used\nin this paper. All definitions and formulas are well known\nand can be found in Ref. [16]. In general, the distribution\namplitudes we are interested in are related to nonlocal\nmatrix elements of type4\nh0j \rq2\u00060\u0007\u0015\u000e0; x\u000fq1\u0006x\u0007jV\u0006p\u0007i or\nh0j \rq2\u00060\u0007\u000e0; vx\u000f\u0015Ga\u001a\u0010\u0006vx\u0007+a=2\u000evx; x\u000fq1\u0006x\u0007jV\u0006p\u0007i:\nx is lightlike or close to lightlike and the light-cone expan-\nsion is an expansion in x2; v is a number between 0 and 1;\nand \u0015 a combination of Dirac matrices. The expressions\n\u000e0; x\u000f, etc., denote Wilson lines that render the matrix\nelements, and hence the DAs, gauge invariant. One usually\nworks in the convenient Fock-Schwinger gauge\nx\u001aAa\u001a\u0006x\u0007+a=2 \t 0, where all Wilson lines are just 1; we\nwill suppress them from now on.\nThe DAs are formally ordered by twist, i.e., the differ-\nence between spin and dimension of the corresponding\noperators. In this paper we take into account 2- and 3-\nparticle DAs of twist-2, 3, and 4. The classification scheme\nof vector meson DAs is more involved than that for pseu-\ndoscalars; it has been studied in detail in Ref. [16]. One\nimportant point is the distinction between chiral-even and\nchiral-odd operators, i.e., those with an odd or even number\nof \u0018\u001a matrices. In the limit of massless quarks the DAs\nassociated with these operators form two completely sepa-\nrate classes that do not mix under a change of \u001aIR. One\nmore important parameter is the polarization state of the\nmeson, longitudinal ( k ) or transverse ( ? ), which helps\nto classify twist-2 and 3 DAs. Up to twist-4 accuracy, we\nhave the following decomposition of chiral-even 2-particle\nDAs [16]:\nh0j \rq2\u00060\u0007\u0018\u001aq1\u0006x\u0007jV\u0006P; +\u0007i\n\t fVmV\n\u0004\ne\u0006+\u0007z\nPz\nP\u001a\nZ 1\n0\ndu e\u000biuPz\n\b\n\nk\u0006u\u0007 \nm\n2\nVx\n2\n16\nAk\u0006u\u0007\n\nO\u0006x4\u0007\n\t\n\n\n\n\ne\u0006+\u0007\u001a \u000b P\u001a e\n\u0006+\u0007z\nPz\n\u000bZ 1\n0\ndu e\u000biuPz\u000eg\u0006v\u0007? \u0006u\u0007\n\nO\u0006x2\u0007\u000f \u000b 1\n2\nz\u001a\ne\u0006+\u0007z\n\u0006pz\u00072m\n2\nV\nZ 1\n0\ndu e\u000biupz\u000eg3\u0006u\u0007\n\n\nk\u0006u\u0007 \u000b 2g\u0006v\u0007? \u0006u\u0007 \nO\u0006x2\u0007\u000f\n\u0005\n; (15)\n3If there is more than one contribution of a given twist, they\nwill mix under a change of the factorization scale \u001aIR and it is\nonly in the sum of all such contributions that the residual \u001aIR\ndependence cancels.\n4The currents to use for \u00070 and ! are \u0006 \ru\u0015u\u001a \rd\u0015d\u0007= \u0001\u0001\u00012p ,\nrespectively.\nPATRICIA BALL AND ROMAN ZWICKY PHYSICAL REVIEW D 71, 014029 (2005)\n014029-4\nh0j \rq2\u00060\u0007\u0018\u001a\u00185q1\u0006x\u0007jV\u0006P; +\u0007i \t \u000b 14 fVmV\u001d\n\u0010'0\n\u001a e\n\u0006+\u0007\n\u0010 p'z0\nZ 1\n0\ndu e\u000biupz\u000eg\u0006a\u0007? \u0006u\u0007 \nO\u0006x2\u0007\u000f; (16)\nand for the chiral-odd ones:\nh0j \rq2\u00060\u0007\u001e\u001a\u0010q1\u0006x\u0007jV\u0006P; +\u0007i \t ifTV\n\u0004\n\u0006e\u0006+\u0007\u001a P\u0010 \u000b e\u0006+\u0007\u0010 P\u001a\u0007\nZ 1\n0\ndu e\u000biuPz\n\b\n\n?\u0006u\u0007 \nm\n2\nVx\n2\n16\nA?\u0006u\u0007\n\t\n\n \u0006p\u001az\u0010 \u000b p\u0010z\u001a\u0007 e\n\u0006+\u0007z\n\u0006pz\u00072m\n2\nV\nZ 1\n0\ndu e\u000biupz\n\b\nh\u0006t\u0007k \u0006u\u0007 \u000b\n1\n2\n\n?\u0006u\u0007 \u000b 12 h3\u0006u\u0007 \nO\u0006x\n2\u0007\n\t\n\n 1\n2\n\u0006e\u0006+\u0007\u001a z\u0010 \u000b e\u0006+\u0007\u0010 z\u001a\u0007m\n2\nV\npz\nZ 1\n0\ndu e\u000biupz\u000eh3\u0006u\u0007 \u000b\n?\u0006u\u0007 \nO\u0006x2\u0007\u000f\n\u0005\n; (17)\nh0j \rq2\u00060\u0007q1\u0006x\u0007jV\u0006P; +\u0007i \t i2 f\nT\nV\u0006e\u0006+\u0007z\u0007m2V\n\u001b\nZ 1\n0\ndu e\u000biupz\u000eh\u0006s\u0007k \u0006u\u0007 \nO\u0006x2\u0007\u000f:\n(18)\nThe relevant 3-particle DAs are defined in Appendix B.\nNote that we distinguish between lightlike vectors p; z\nwith p2 \t 0 \t z2 and the vectors P; x with P2 \t m2V and\nx2 \u0001 0; explicit relations between these vectors are given\nin Appendix B.

Rather than as matrix\nelements of operators with definite twist, the DAs are\ndefined as matrix elements of operators built from fields\nwith a fixed spin projection onto the light cone. For quark\nfields, the possible spin projections are s \t \u001c1=2 and the\ncorresponding projection operators P\n \t 1=\u00062pz\u0007p6 z6 and\nP\u000b \t 1=\u00062pz\u0007z6 p6 . Fields with fixed spin projection have a\ndefinite conformal spin, given by j \t 1=2\u0006s\n\ncanonical mass dimension\u0007, and composite operators built\nfrom such fields can be expanded in terms of increasing\nconformal spin.5 The expansion of the corresponding DAs,\nsuitably dubbed conformal expansion, is one of the pri-\nmary tools in the analysis of meson DAs, and together with\nthe use of the QCD equations of motion it allows one to\nparametrize the plethora of 2- and 3-particle DAs in terms\nof a manageable number of independent hadronic matrix\nelements. DAs defined as matrix elements of operators\nwith definite twist, on the other hand, do not have a well-\ndefined conformal expansion [18], and this is the reason\nwhy we prefer the above definitions. In an admittedly\nrather sloppy way we will from now on refer to\ng\u0006v;a\u0007? ; h\n\u0006s;t\u0007\nk as twist-3 DAs and to h3; g3;A?;k as twist-4\nDAs.

As the contributions\nfrom different comformal spin do not mix under renormal-\nization, at least to leading logarithmic accuracy, one can\nconstruct models for DAs by truncating the expansion at a\nfixed order. Despite the absence of any \u2018\u2018small parameter\u2019\u2019\nin that expansion, the truncation is justified inasmuch as\none is interested in physical amplitudes rather than the DA\nitself. If we write\namplitude \t\nZ 1\n0\ndu \n\u0006u\u0007T\u0006u\u0007;\nthen, assuming that T is a regular function of u, i.e., with no\n(end point) singularities, the highly oscillating behavior of\nthe Gegenbauer-polynomials suppresses contributions\nfrom higher orders in the conformal expansion. Even for\na function T with a mild end point singularity, for instance\nT \t lnu, we find, using the generating function of the\nGegenbauer polynomials,Z 1\n0\ndu \n\u0006u\u0007T\u0006u\u0007 \t \u000b 5\n6\na0 \n\nX1\nn\t1\n\u0006\u000b1\u0007n\u000b1\nn\u0006n\n 3\u0007 3an:\nThis result indicates that, assuming the an falloff in n,\nwhich, as we shall see seen in Sec. IV C is indeed the\ncase, even a truncation after the first few terms should give\na reasonable approximation to the full amplitude. A more\nthorough discussion of the convergence of the conformal\nexpansion for physical amplitudes can be found in\nRef. [19]. The major shortcoming of models based on the\ntruncation of the conformal expansion is the fact that the\ninformation available on the actual values of the an (and, in\nparticular, their analogues in 3-particle DAs) is, to put it\nmildly, scarce. We therefore use truncated models only for\nDAs whose contribution to the LCSRs is small as is the\ncase for all 3-particle DAs and the twist-4 DAs; explicit\nformulas are given in Appendix B. All contributions due to\nor induced by twist-2 DAs, on the other hand, are treated as\ndescribed in Sec. IV C.\nThe major difference between the analysis of LCSRs for\nB! vector meson form factors and that of B!\npseudoscalar form factors presented in [1] is probably the\nidentification of a suitable parameter by which to order the\nrelative weight of different contributions to the sum rules.\nFor B! pseudoscalar form factors, the standard classifi-\ncation in terms of increasing twist proved to be suitable, as\nthe chiral parities of the twist-2 DA and 2-particle twist-3\nDAs are different, so that contribution of the latter to the\nLCSRs is suppressed by a factor m2\u0012=\u0006mu \nmd\u0007=mb. In\naddition, the admixture of twist-2 matrix elements to twist-\n3 DAs and of twist-2 and three matrix elements to twist-4\nDAs is small and moreover vanishes in the chiral limit\nm\u0012 ! 0. For vector mesons, the situation is more complex:\nfor instance, both the twist-2 DA \n? and the twist-3 DA\ng\u0006v\u0007? contribute at the same order to the form factors A2 and\nA0, in the combination \nk \u000b g\u0006v\u0007? . Naive twist counting is\nevidently not very appropriate for classifying the relative\nsize of contributions of different DAs to the form factors.\nInstead, we decide to classify the relevance of contribu-\ntions to the LCSRs not by twist but by a parameter 7 \/ mV .\nThe precise definition of 7 depends on the kinematics of\nthe process; to leading order in an expansion in 1=mb,\nhowever, one finds 7HQL \t mV=mb. The numerical analy-\nsis of the LCSRs does indeed display a clear suppression of\nterms in O\u00067\u0007 and higher, which suggests the following\nclassification of 2-particle DAs:\n(i) O\u000670\u0007:\n?;\n(ii) O\u000671\u0007:\nk; g\u0006v;a\u0007? ;\n(iii) O\u000672\u0007:h\u0006s;t\u0007k ; h3;A?;\n(iv) O\u000673\u0007:g3;Ak.\nWe treat 7 as expansion parameter of the light-cone ex-\npansion and shall combine it with the perturbative QCD\nexpansion in 's to obtain a second order expression for the\ncorrelation functions (12); terms in 73 are dropped.\nIII.

In this section we describe the calculation of the\ncontributions of 2-particle DAs to the above correlation\nfunctions; those of 3-particle DAs are calculated in\nAppendix C.\nIn light-cone expansion and including only contributions\nfrom 2-particle Fock states of the mesons, each of the seven\ninvariants \u00150;\u001c;V , A;B;C can be written as a convolution\nintegral of type\n\u0015V \t\nZ dk\n\n2\u0012\n\nVab\u0006k\n\u0007Tba\u0006k\n; p2B; q2\u0007; (28)\nwith a; b being spinor indices. p2 \t m2V is set to 0 and k\n\nis the longitudinal momentum of the quark in the vector\nmeson V, which is related to the momentum fraction u\nintroduced in Sec.

Let us choose V\u0006q2\u0007 for a Bq transition as\nexample. The corresponding correlation function is \u0015V as\ndefined in Eq. (26). The basic idea is to express \u0015V in two\ndifferent ways, as dispersion relation of the expression\nobtained in light-cone expansion on one hand, and as\ndispersion relation in hadronic contributions on the other\nhand. Equating both representations one obtains a light-\ncone sum rule for V.

The task is\nnow to find sets of parameters M2 (the Borel parameter)\nand s0 (the continuum threshold) such that the resulting\nform factor does not depend too much on the precise values\nof these parameters; in addition the continuum contribu-\ntion, that is the part of the dispersive integral from s0 to 1,\nwhich has been subtracted from both sides of (44), should\nnot be too large, say less than 30% of the total dispersive\nintegral.\nB.

The ratios\nfTV=fV also have been determined from lattice [22] and\nagree with ours within errors. Meson DAs are discussed in\nthe next subsection.\nThe b quark mass entering our formulas is the one-loop\npole mass mb for which we use mb \t \u00064:80\u001c 0:05\u0007 GeV\ncf. Table 6 in Ref.

As for\nthe strong coupling, we take 's\u0006mZ\u0007 \t 0:118 and use NLO\nevolution to evaluate it at lower scales. All scale-dependent\nquantities are evaluated at the factoriszation scale \u001aIR\nwhich separates long- from short-distance physics.

The state of the art of the former are un-\nquenched NRQCD simulations with 2\n 1 light flavors,\nyielding fBs \t \u0006260\u001c 30\u0007 MeV [24], which is slightly\nlarger than the 2003 recommendation fBs \t \u0006240\u001c\n35\u0007 MeV [25]. For fBd , it is difficult to find any recent\nnumbers, the consensus being that more calculations at\nsmaller quark masses are needed in order to bring the\nextrapolation to physical mu;d under sufficient control\n[24]. As for QCD sum rules, both fBd and fBs have been\ndetermined to O\u0006'2s\u0007 accuracy: fBd \t \u0006208\u001c 20\u0007 MeV\nand fBs \t \u0006224\u001c 21\u0007 MeV [26], in agreement with lattice\ndeterminations. The impact ofO\u0006'2s\u0007 corrections on fBq;s is\nnonnegligible. As the diagrams responsible for these cor-\nrections, for instance B vertex corrections, are precisely the\nsame that will enter LCSRs at O\u0006'2s\u0007, we proceed from the\nassumption that these corrections will tend to cancel in the\nratio (correlation function)\/fB. We hence evaluate fBd;s\nfrom a QCD sum rule to O\u0006's\u0007 accuracy, which reads\n[27]:11\nf2Bqm\n2\nBe\n\u000bm2B=M2 \t\nZ s0\nm2b\nds \u0007pert\u0006s\u0007e\u000bs=M2 \n C \rqqh \rqqi\n\n C \rqGqh \rq\u001egGqi\n \nZ s0\nm2b\nds \u0007tot\u0006s\u0007e\u000bs=M2 : (45)\nHere h \rqqi and h \rq\u001egGqi are the quark and mixed conden-\nsate, respectively, for which we use the following numeri-\ncal values at \u001a \t 1 GeV:\nh \rqqi \t \u000b\u00060:24\u001c 0:01\u00073 GeV3 and\nh \rq\u001egGqi \t 0:8 GeV2h \rqqi: (46)\nThe C are perturbative Wilson coefficients multiplying the\ncondensates. C \rqq is known to O\u0006's\u0007 accuracy [26,28],\nC \rqGq at tree-level.\nThe criteria for choosing M2 and s0 in the above sum\nrule are very similar to those to be used for the LCSRs.\nIdeally, if the correlation function were known exactly, the\nsum rule would be independent of M2. In practice it is not,\nbut \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 sum rules, plotted as function of M2, still\nexhibit a flat extremum. We hence require the existence\nof such an extremum in M2 and evaluate the sum rule\nprecisely at that point. This eliminates M2 as independent\nparameter and leaves us with s0. As already mentioned\nafter Eq. (44), the purpose of the Borel transformation is to\nenhance the contribution of the ground state to the physical\nspectral function with respect to that of higher states. We\nhence require that continuum contribution, that is the in-\ntegral over \u0007tot\u0006s\u0007 for s > s0, must not be too large. To be\nspecific, we require\"Z 1\ns0\nds \u0007tot\u0006s\u0007e\u000bs=M2\n#,\"Z 1\nm2b\nds \u0007tot\u0006s\u0007e\u000bs=M2\n#\n< 30%:\nThis puts a lower bound on s0. The larger s0, the smaller\nM2, the position of the minimum, and the larger nonper-\nturbative contributions to (45). As the condensates are\nmeant to yield small nonperturbative corrections, but\nblow up at small M2, requiring the nonperturbative correc-\ntions to be not too large puts an upper bound on s0. For\nfBq;s , we require the highest term in the condensate expan-\nsion, the mixed condensate, to contribute less than 10% to\nthe correlation function. For LCSRs, which rely on an\nexpansion in higher twist rather than higher condensates,\nwe correspondingly require the contribution of higher\ntwists to the LCSR not to exceed 10%. One more require-\nment on the s0 is that they not stray away too much from\n\u2018\u2018reasonable\u2019\u2019 values: s0 is to separate the ground state from\nhigher-mass contributions, and hence should be below the\nnext known clear resonance in that channel.

We would like to stress that these values are not to be\ninterpreted as new independent determinations of fBq;s , but\nare intermediate results to be used in the evaluation of the\nLCSRs.\nWe proceed to determine the continuum thresholds and\nBorel parameters for the LCSRs, using the same criteria as\nabove. In order to keep the complexity of the calculation at\na manageable level, for each form factor the corresponding\nset is determined only once, at q2 \t 0. To avoid confusion\nbetween parameters entering (45) and those entering the\nLCSRs, let us call the latter onesM2LC and sF0 whereF is the\nform factor. For larger q2, these parameters are expected to\nchange slightly.

II and detailed in Appendix B, the\nDAs entering the LCSRs can be modeled by a truncated\nconformal expansion. It turns out that the dominant con-\ntributions to the sum rules come from the twist-2 DAs\n\n?;k, which to NLO in the conformal expansion are de-\nscribed by the lowest three Gegenbauer moments: a?;k0  \n1, which follows from the normalization of the DAs a?;k1 ,\nwhich is nonzero only for K\u0002, and a?;k2 . In Ref. [4], it was\nthese three parameters that were used to define the models\nfor \n?;k; all terms an\u00173 were dropped.\nThe numerical values of a1;2 (and higher moments) are\nlargely unknown. a1 has been determined from QCD sum\nrules in [12,29,30].

For\ninstance, assuming ai \u0017 0:05 it is necessary to include ak2\nand a?2;4;6;8 in order to match the size of the contributions\nfrom quark-quark-gluon matrix elements, and even for\nai \u0017 0:01 one still needs ak2 and a?2;4. If, on the other\nhand, one consistently neglects terms that contribute less\nthan 1% to the form factor, one can drop nearly all con-\ntributions from quark-quark-gluon matrix elements, unless\ntheir values as given in Appendix B are grossly under-\nestimated. If ai \u0017 0:05, one then has to keep a?2;4;6, but can\ndrop all akn>0. The upshot is that, in view of the lack of\ninformation on a?;kn , it is a good idea to devise models for\n\n?;k with a small number of parameters, possibly tied to\nexperimental observables, and a well-defined \u2018\u2018tail\u2019\u2019 of\nhigher-order Gegenbauer moments. This task is under-\ntaken in Ref. [19].\nFollowing Ref. [19], we introduce two-parameter mod-\nels for (the symmetric part of) \n?;k which are defined by\nthe fall-off behavior of the Gegenbauer moments an in n\nand the value of the integral\n7 \t\nZ 1\n0\ndu\n\n\u0006u\u0007\n3u\n 1\n X1\nn\t1\na2n; (50)\n7 \t 1 for the asymptotic DA. In particular we require 7 to\nbe finite, which implies that the an must fall off sufficiently\nfast. The choice of 7 as characteristic parameter of\n relies\non the fact that it is directly related to an experimental\nobservable, at least for \u0012 and C, namely, the \u0012\u0006C\u0007\u0018\u0018\u0002\ntransition form factor, for which experimental constraints\nexist from CLEO [31]. We assume that the vector meson\nDAs are not fundamentally different and take the range of\n7\u0006\u0012\u0007 extracted from CLEO as the likely range for 7\u0006\u0007\u0007.\nThe second parameter characterizing our models is the fall-\noff behavior of the Gegenbauer moments in n, which we\nassume to be powerlike.

As we\npresume that 7\u0006\u001a\u0007 will be measured, if at all, at the low\nscale \u001a \t 1 GeV, we choose this as the reference scale. 7\nat higher scales can be obtained from Eq.

Using\nthe input parameters given in Tables V and VI, we obtain\nthe results collected in Table VII.\nFor the discussion of theoretical uncertainties, we dis-\ntinguish between uncertainties that can be reduced by\nfuture more accurate determinations of the corresponding\nhadronic parameters and others that are either systematic\nuncertainties, inherent to the method of LCSRs, or parame-\nter uncertainties not likely to be reduced in the near future.\nThe latter comprise the dependence of the form factors on\nthe LCSR parameters s0, M2, \u001aIR and, via fB, the quark\nand mixed condensate. Our results also depend, very\nmildly, on ms and, more importantly, on the meson DAs\nwhich are described by the 2-parameter model (53). All\nthese parameters induce a theoretical error of the form\nfactors which we determine by varying\n(i) the threshold s0 by \u001c1:0 GeV2;\n(ii) the Borel parameterM2 in Eq. (47) by\u001c1:5 GeV2;\n(iii) the infrared factorization scale \u001aIR \t\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\nm2B \u000bm2b\nq\nby \u001c1 GeV;\n(iv) the quark condensate and the mixed condensate as\nindicated in Eq.

In Fig. 4 we show the\ndependence of selected form factors on 7 and a. The\nuncertainty in these parameters is the most important\nsingle source of error of the form factors and amounts to\nhalf of the total error.\nThe form factors also depend, rather mildly, on mb:\nvarying mb by \u001c0:05 GeV around the central value\n4.8 GeV, and using s0 and M2 as given in Tables IV and\nV, we obtain the error 7mb which ranges from 1% to\n5%.\nOne more source of uncertainty of the form factors is\ndue to fV and fTV , the vector and tensor coupling of the\nvector mesons. This is easily understood by splitting the\ngeneric form factor F into two terms proportional to fT and\nfL  f:\nF \t fLFL \n fTFT: (56)\nAs argued in Sec. II the first term is of order 7 \/ mV , the\nsecond of order one and indeed, for most form factors, is\nthe dominant contribution. The present errors of fT , as\ncollected in Table III, are nonnegligible. fT is accessible to\nlattice calculations and first results have been reported in\nRef. [22], which indicates that a reduction of the error of fT\nseems feasible. In order to allow the adjustment of our\n0. 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.\n-0.1\n0.\n0.1\n0.2\nFIG. 3.

K\u0002 transition are about\n20% larger than those for Bq ! \u0007. The reason for\nthis is twofold: on the one hand, the K\u0002 vector and\ntensor couplings are larger than those of the \u0007. On\nthe other hand, the SU(3) breaking of the twist-2\nDAs, parametrized by the first Gegenbauer moment\na1, gives a positive contribution to the form factors;\n(ii) the form factors for Bs ! K\u0002 have a tendency to be\nsmaller than those for Bq ! \u0007. The reason for this\nis a negative contribution of a1 and the fact that fBs\nis larger than fBq . On the other hand, the optimum\ns0 are also larger than for Bq ! \u0007, which partially\ncompensates the first two effects;\n(iii) the Bq ! ! form factors are slightly smaller than\nthose for Bq ! \u0007. This is a consequence of the fact\nthat the ! vector and tensor couplings are smaller\nthan those of the \u0007;\n(iv) the total theoretical error is dominated by that of\nthe twist-2 DAs and the sum rule parameters s0 and\nM2. The former can, in principle, be reduced by\nfuture calculations, the second is systematic and\nirreducible.\nThe typical total uncertainty of each form factor is 10%,\nranging between 8% and 13%. Any significant reduction of\nthe error requires more accurate information on the twist-2\nDAs. The minimum irreducible theoretical uncertainty is\nset by the systematic uncertainty of the LCSR approach\nand encoded in the dependence of the results on s0 andM2;\nit amounts to about 6% to 7%.\nLet us also compare our results to those obtained in\nRef. [4] by the same method, but with less sophistication.\nThe main difference between our present and our previous\nanalysis is the inclusion of radiative corrections to 2-\nparticle twist-3 contributions, the description of the twist-\n2 DAs by models including all-order effects in the confor-\nmal expansion, the more accurate determination of the sum\nrule parameters s0 and M2, and the much more detailed\nerror analysis. The most striking difference between the\nactual results affects the Bs ! K\u0002 transition, whose form\nfactors were predicted, in [4], to be between 10% and 30%\nsmaller than those in Table VII. The reason for this dis-\ncrepancy is mainly the more accurate determination of M2\nand s0 we employ in the present analysis\u2014in Ref. [4] all\nTABLE VII.

Nonetheless we take it as\nan indication for the consistency of our approach that the\ndouble pole formula with unrestricted pole positions gives\nresults that agree qualitatively with those from the re-\nstricted fits. We also have checked the dependence of the\nfits on the maximum value of q2max;LCSR up to which LCSR\nresults are included into the fit. It turns out that the fits are\nvery robust against lowering q2max;LCSR; lowering it from\n14 GeV2 to 7 GeV2 changes the fitted values at 20 GeV2\nby at most 8%, T2 being the odd one sticking out.

Any further check of the fitted r1 requires\ninformation on the couplings gBB\u0006\u0002\u0007\u0007, which have been\ncalculated from both LCSRs [33] and within the constitu-\nent quark meson (CQM) model [34]\u2014with significantly\ndifferent results. The situation resembles that for gDD\u0002\u0012,\nwhere LCSR determinations are typically by a factor two\nsmaller than lattice and CQM calculations [35]. For this\ncoupling there actually exists an experimental measure-\nment by CLEO [36], which agrees with the lattice and\nCQM determinations, but disagrees with LCSRs. For the\ncorresponding B coupling gBB\u0002\u0012 there is no experimental\nmeasurement, as the decay B\u0002 ! B\u0012 is forbidden by phase\nspace, but one can use heavy quark scaling to obtain gBB\u0002\u0012\nfrom the measured gDD\u0002\u0012 and compare it with the corre-\nsponding theoretical predictions. It turns out that again\nlattice and CQM calculations are favored, whereas the\nLCSR calculation gives a too small result, which can be\nunderstood following the discussion in Ref. [37].

[4]. It improves upon the latter by\n(i) including predictions for all form factors of Bq;s\ntransitions to O\u0006's\u0007 accuracy for twist-2 and 3 2-\nparticle contributions;\n(ii) including a more sophisticated method for fixing\nsum rule specific parameters cf. Sec. IV B;\n(iii) implementing recently developed new models for\nthe dominant nonperturbative vector meson con-\ntributions, the twist-2 vector meson distribution\namplitudes cf. Ref.

Appendix A;\n(v) giving a careful assessment of uncertainties at zero\nmomentum transfer cf. Sec. IV D;\n(vi) including a parametrization of the q2 dependence\nof form factors valid in the full physical regime of\nmomentum transfer cf. Sec. IV E;\n(vii) giving a variety of consistency checks for the\nrobustness of the q2 fits and their numerical results.\nThe accuracy of our results is limited, on the one hand,\nby the uncertainty of hadronic input parameters and, on the\nother hand, by the systematic uncertainty induced by the\nfact that QCD sum rules on the light cone are an approx-\nimative method. The uncertainty due to the variation of\nonly the sum rule specific parameters is about 7%, which\ncannot be reduced any further and hence sets the minimum\ntheoretical uncertainty that can be achieved within this\nmethod. An equally large theoretical uncertainty is induced\nby hadronic parameters and can, in principle, be improved\nupon. We quote, in particular, the tensor couplings fTV of\nvector mesons, which presently come with the rather large\nerror quoted in Table III. Improvement should be possible\nby dedicated lattice calculations, a first example of which\nis Ref. [22]. Another relevant hadronic parameter is 7, the\nfirst inverse moment of the twist-2 vector meson distribu-\ntion amplitudes, as defined in Sec. IV C. We have inferred a\nlikely range for this parameter for \u0007 and ! mesons from\nthe known experimental constraints on 7\u0006\u0012\u0007, and further\ndetermined a range for 7\u0006K\u0002\u0007 and 7\u0006\n\u0007 from the observed\ndecrease, within QCD sum rule calculations, of the second\nGegenbauer moment a2 with increasing meson mass.\nComparing the theoretical errors collected in Table VII\nwith the global theoretical uncertainty \u000515% quoted in\nour previous publication [4], we have achieved a reduction\nto about 10%. This is partially due to a reduction of the\nuncertainties of the hadronic input parameters, in particular\nmb, and partially due to a refinement of the assessment of\nsum rule specific uncertainties as discussed in Sec. IV B.\nAny future reduction of the total uncertainty will depend\non more accurate determinations of 7, which are abso-\nlutely essential not only for light-cone sum rule calcula-\ntions but also for exploiting the full potential of QCD\nfactorization formulas for nonleptonic exclusive B decays\n[6]. We take this occasion to urge lattice practitioners to\ntake up the challenge and develop new and ingenious\nmethods to tackle this problem\u2014or just give us an accu-\nrate value of a2, which would already be a big step\nforward.\nThe prospects for future direct determinations of B! V\nform factors from lattice calculations do appear a bit\nclouded. On the one hand, there are two recent studies,\nby the SPQcdR and UKQCD collaborations, Ref. [39],\nusing an improved Wilson action and the quenched ap-\nproximation. The b quarks are fully relativistic and have\ntypical masses of about 2\u20133 GeV, so they need to be\nextrapolated to the physical b quark mass. On the other\nhand, we conclude from [40] that an unquenched calcula-\ntion in NRQCD is not really on the menu, which, as far as\nwe understand, is due to an improvement in the treatment\nof light-quark masses on the lattice, causing the \u0007 and\nother vector mesons to become instable particles without\na pronounced plateau in the falloff of the correlation func-\ntion and essentially prevents a precise determination of\ntheir properties from lattice. We do not pretend to be\nsufficient experts in LQCD to be able to meaningfully\ncomment on these issues but remain hopeful that the\nsituation will be clarified in due course.\nWe have calculated all form factors for 0 \u0013 q2 \u0013\n14 GeV2; the upper bound on q2 is due to the limitations\nof the light-cone expansion which requires the final state\nmeson to have energies E\u0004 \bQCD: for q2max \t 14 GeV2\nthe meson energy is E \t 1:3 GeV. In order to facilitate the\nuse of our results we have given, in Sec. IV E, Eqs. (59)\u2013\n(61), simple parametrizations that include the main fea-\ntures of the analytical properties of the form factors and are\nvalid in the full physical regime 0 \u0013 q2 \u0013 \u0006mB \u000bmV\u00072.\nThe corresponding results for our preferred set of input\nparameters are given in Table VIII. We have checked that\nthe fit results are fairly insensitive to the maximum value of\nq2 included and that reducing the latter to, e.g., 7 GeV2\nchanges the extrapolated values of the form factors at q2 \t\n20 GeV2 by typically only 1% to 2%, and by 8% at most\n(for T2).\nIn Sec. I we mentioned factorization formulas for form\nfactors derived in SCET, Ref. [8\u201310], which, in particular,\nimply certain (heavy quark) symmetry relations. Since the\nobjective of this paper was to provide numerical results,\nready for use in phenomenological applications, we did not\ndiscuss the question whether and to what extent our results\nfulfill these relations, nor the size of symmetry-breaking\ncorrections. A previous study of the corresponding effect in\nB! pseudoscalar decays has indicated that such correc-\ntions are likely to be nonnegligible [41]. We plan to come\nback to these points in a future publication.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nR.

This convention differs in sign by the one of Itzykson\/\nZuber [43] used in some programming packages, e.g.,\nFEYNCALC. We use a sign convention for the strong cou-\npling g where the covariant derivative is defined as D\u001a \t\n@\u001a \u000b igA\u001a and hence the Feynman rule for qqg vertices is\n\nig\u0018\u001a.\nLet us also clarify the treatment of SU(3)-breaking\neffects in DAs. SU(3) breaking occurs in three different\nways:\n(i) the contribution of odd Gegenbauer-moments\na1;3;... to the DAs of the K\u0002;\n(ii) a difference in the values of the couplings f\u0006T\u0007V , the\neven Gegenbauer moments a\u00072 \u0001 aK\n\u0002\n2 and 3-\nparticle matrix elements;\n(iii) the modification of relations between DAs by terms\nin mq1 \u001cmq2 .\nWe will take into account the first effect wherever it occurs,\nexcept for terms in O\u000672\u0007, the reason being that the struc-\nture of 72 terms is very involved and there are yet unknown\ncontributions in m2Va?1 induced by 3-particle twist-4 DAs.\nThe second effect is taken into account for the decay\nconstants and parametrized by the dependence of the\nform factors on the parameters 7, as discussed in\nSec. IV C; we do not include SU(3) breaking for the 3-\nparticle matrix elements as information on these effects is\nvirtually nonexistant. The third effect is taken into account\nat O\u00067'0s ; 7's\u0007, i.e., for the chiral-even DAs g\u0006a;v\u0007? . It does\nnot occur at O\u000670\u0007 and the corresponding terms are un-\nknown at O\u000672\u0007.\nThe 2-particle DAs have been defined in Eqs.
