INTRODUCTION\nTHERE is continuing effort to develop encoderless vectorcontrolled induction motor drives. Several speed estima-\ntion algorithms based on the steady-state and dynamic charac-\nteristics of the machine have been commercially implemented\n[1], [2]. An encoderless arrangement increases the system ro-\nbustness and reduces manufacturing cost. Some algorithms also\nreduce the sensitivity of flux orientation to rotor resistance as the\nerror of slip calculation can be compensated by the estimated\nspeed. Recent studies addressed challenges in the low-speed\nrange where measurement noise is comparable to the motor\nvoltage used for speed estimation [3]. In many previous studies,\nthe controller was treated in the continuous time domain. This\npaper will illustrate an important effect of discrete sampling in\na practical encoderless drive with a digital controller.\nManuscript received March 15, 2002; revised June 24, 2003. Abstract pub-\nlished on the Internet January 14, 2004.\nL. Ran is with the School of Engineering, University of Durham, Durham\nDH1 3LE, U.K. (e-mail: li.ran@durham.ac.uk).\nY. Liao is with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing Univer-\nsity, Chongqing, 400044, China (e-mail: yongliaocqu@cta.cq.cn).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TIE.2004.825371\nIt is known that sampling can cause phase delay and aliasing\ndepending on the signal frequency and sampling rate [4, pp.\n63\u201368]. In motor drives, the speed loop usually has a low sam-\npling rate. With an encoder of high resolution, the measured\nspeed is smooth due to the shaft inertia; a relatively long sam-\npling period is acceptable and low-pass filtering is not necessary.\nHowever, in an encoderless drive, speed feedback is obtained\nfrom a software observer that can have fast transient response.\nAs a result, considerable ripple of the speed feedback may be\nobserved between samples. It is possible for the dynamics of the\nobserver to interact with the sampling action in the speed loop.\nSometimes, a sustained resonance can be caused although the\nactual speed remains almost constant due to inertia. There are\nreported cases of drives having been damaged by excessive res-\nonant current in the switching devices and electrolytic dc-link\ncapacitors [5], [6].\nThis is related to, but different from the classic problems of\naliasing and hidden oscillation in a digital control system [4, pp.\n160\u2013164]. The steady-state speed is ideally a dc and should not\ncause aliasing. Resonance can still occur, which will be sampled\nexplicitly in the control loop. For reasons to be expanded, the\nproblem is associated with stability due to speed feedback from\nan observer and the ripple in the signal to be sampled is only\nintroduced by the sampling action itself. Design and setting of\ncontrol gains during commissioning must avoid instability. This\nrequires investigation into the mechanism giving rise to the sam-\npling-induced resonance.\nThis paper presents test results to demonstrate the resonance\nwhich is briefly explained referring to a simple model. An ana-\nlytical method is developed to estimate the risk of sampling-in-\nduced resonance in an encoderless vector controlled induction\nmotor drive. In addition to the discrete speed control loop and\nobserver, the method also includes the response of the motor\nwhich will affect the phenomenon through current control on\nthe magnetization and torque axes. Further experiments are per-\nformed to verify the method which is used to predict the effects\nof control gains and a smoothing filter. Although the focus is\non a specific speed observer, the analysis can be extended to\nother encoderless systems. It is shown that a constraint, which\nis unnecessary with an encoder, needs to be considered when\ndeveloping and operating encoderless drives.\nII. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION AND\nSAMPLING-INDUCED RESONANCE\nFig. 1 shows the simplified block diagram of an encoderless\nvector controlled induction motor drive; the reader is referred to\n[2] for a detailed explanation. According to the flux and speed\ndemands, the controller produces voltage applied to the motor\n0278-0046\/04$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\n552 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 51, NO. 3, JUNE 2004\nFig. 1. Encoderless vector control of induction motor.\nthrough an inverter. Components on the (magnetization) and\n(torque) axes consist of terms of the following voltage equa-\ntions in the rotor flux reference frame. Outputs of the current\ncontrollers are added to them [7], [8]\n(1)\nThis is the voltage produced by the inverter and applied to the\nmotor. The configuration shown in Fig. 1 is one of the typical\nsystems with an encoderless arrangement.\nThe speed observer is driven by the output of the torque axis\ncurrent controller. If the calculated slip and the above motor\nvoltage are correct, the estimated speed will be the actual speed\nto give the correct supply frequency. Error in slip calculation,\ndue to, e.g., inaccurate parameters, is reflected as a small error in\nthe estimated speed. This paper is concerned with the particular\nspeed observer while other estimation algorithms can be simi-\nlarly analyzed [1], [2], [9]. The speed loop is scanned at a rela-\ntively slow rate, 5 ms, while the rest of the controller including\nthe speed observer is executed every 400 s corresponding to\nthe 2.5 kHz pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) process in the in-\nverter. With respect to the sampling rate of the speed control\nloop, other parts can be regarded as continuous.\nA test drive, whose parameters are detailed in the Appendix,\nis used to illustrate the phenomenon. The drive operates at 50%\nload and full speed. When the speed proportional gain is in-\ncreased to 4 times of the given value, the -axis current demand\nFig. 2. Sampling-induced resonance in encoderless operation.\nand feedback, and , are shown in Fig. 2. They are mea-\nsured by accessing the internal variables in the microprocessor\nsystem. Digital-to-analog conversion with appropriate scaling is\nused to plot these signals on the scope. The result shows reso-\nnance with a period of 10 ms, i.e., twice the sampling time of\nthe speed loop. The demand remains constant between two sam-\npling points. Since is the torque producing or \u201cactive\u201d current\ncomponent, the resonance implies a pulsating air-gap torque and\nRAN AND LIAO: SAMPLING-INDUCED RESONANCE IN INDUCTION MOTOR DRIVE 553\nFig. 3. Measurements in operation with encoder.\nFig. 4. A simple example system.\nalso an exchange of real power between the ac and dc sides of\nthe inverter. Because of the latter, harmonic currents at 100 Hz\nand its integer multiples will flow through the dc link causing\nunexpected harmonics at the drive input side [10].\nFig. 3 shows the measurements under a comparative condi-\ntion with speed feedback taken from a shaft encoder instead of\nthe observer. The resonance disappears. The torque ( )-axis cur-\nrent only contains some sixth harmonic of 50 Hz due to internal\ncompensation of the dc-link voltage ripple caused by the input\ndiode rectifier. Therefore, the sampling-induced resonance on\nthe axis seems to be associated especially with the encoder-\nless mode of the drive. It was checked that reference on the mag-\nnetization ( ) axis is constant during resonance, suggesting the\ncause of the resonance is in the speed loop.\nIII. QUALITATIVE EXPLANATION\nFig. 4 shows a sampled system with digitized propor-\ntional\u2013integral (PI) control. The plant to be controlled is first\norder and continuous. The digital PI controller is based on the\nsampled error and the control action is determined assuming\nthat the error is constant in the entire sampling period.\nTo illustrate that sustained resonance can happen, assume that\nthe output is already oscillating between samples as shown in\nFig. 5. At time , the output is at point \u201cA.\u201d The output is\nthen sampled and the error, , is calculated. Since the\nerror is positive, the controller will drive the output to increase.\nAfter a sampling period, the output reaches point \u201cB\u201d where it\nFig. 5. Possible response of example system.\nis sampled again. The error becomes . As it is\nnow negative, the controller forces the output to reduce. The\nresonance is sustained if the rise of the output in one sampling\nperiod equals the decrease in the next, as shown in the figure. At\npoint \u201cA\u201d the discrete controller produces the following control\naction applied to the plant:\n(2)\nwhere and are the proportional and integral gains, while\nthe sampling period. The solution for response in the time do-\nmain gives the following relationship for sustained resonance:\n(3)\nThis further implies the condition below for\n(4)\nIt means that a digital controller does not provide strictly\n\u201cclosed-loop\u201d control between samples. Assuming constant\nerror in a period, control action is determined and applied\nat sampling instants. The response can have ripple between\nsamples during which the system is not under \u201cclosed-loop\u201d\ncontrol. The ripple depends on the inertia or time constant of the\nplant. The analysis can be extended to show that the resonance\nincreases and is unstable if ,\nand is attenuated otherwise. In practice, unstable resonance\ncan sustain due to limiting functions in the system [11]. In this\nexample, sustained or unstable resonance is more likely if the\nsampling period is long or the time constant of the plant is\nshort.\nIV. MODELING OF THE ENCODERLESS DRIVE\nIn order to analyze the effect of sampling in the speed con-\ntrol loop which is executed every 5 ms, it is necessary to model\nthe response of the estimated speed to a disturbance on\nproduced by the discrete speed controller. Motor current re-\nsponse should be included in the model although the motor\nspeed could be practically constant. The motor voltage equa-\ntions (stator side) in the rotor flux orientated \u2013 axes are\n(5)\n554 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 51, NO. 3, JUNE 2004\nThe derivative terms are included because the short-circuit\ntime constant of a large induction motor can be longer than 5\nms; steady state will not be reached within a sampling period\n[7]. In the Laplace domain, the incremental form of the motor\nequations is\n(6)\nwhere and are the average current on the and axes.\ndenotes the average supply frequency. is the variable intro-\nduced by Laplace transform. The supply frequency is a variable\nrather than constant and, hence, appears in (6); is the\nLaplace transform of which is in the time domain. In the\ncontroller, the supply frequency is determined as the sum of the\nestimated rotor speed (converted to electrical) and the calculated\nslip frequency. Both of them are affected by the disturbance.\nCorresponding to a disturbance in the torque current demand,\n, the change of motor voltage can be derived as follows\nincluding the response of current controllers. This is based on\nthe actual controller configuration shown in Fig. 1 and further\ndetailed by (1). See (7), shown at the bottom of the page, where\nand are the common proportional and integral gains of\nthe current controllers. The calculated slip is proportional to the\ntorque current demand, while the speed observer is driven by the\noutput of the current controller on the torque axis. It is therefore\npossible to express the increments of supply frequency and es-\ntimated speed in terms of current\n(8)\n(9)\nwhere and are the proportional and integral gains\nof the observer, and the number of pole pairs of the machine.\nis the Laplace transform of the change of the esti-\nmated mechanical speed.\nBased on the above relationships, it is possible to derive a\nLaplace transfer function from the initial disturbance in the\ntorque current demand, , to the variation of estimated\nspeed . The result is complicated and unsuitable\nfor further analysis. Alternatively, frequency response of\ncan be numerically computed. A\nFig. 6. Bode plots of frequency response \u0001\n (j!)=\u0001I (j!).\nsimplified transfer function is then proposed to represent the\nsystem in the concerned frequency range [12, pp. 409\u2013426].\nFig. 6 shows the Bode plots for the test system with the given\nsettings, computed using the above relationships. The concerned\nfrequency range is chosen to be from 100 to 1000 Hz, which\ncovers the observed resonance and its harmonics up to the 10th.\nA first order transfer function is proposed to model the ob-\ntained response. Fig. 6 indicates that the phase delay is at\nabout 200 Hz. The amplitude is about constant ( 10 dB) below\n200 Hz. Therefore the corner frequency of the first-order system\nis chosen to be 200 Hz. As frequency increases, the amplitude\ndecreases but the phase angle eventually stops decreasing in-\nstead of reaching 90 as in a first order system. Modeling\nthe actual system using a first-order transfer function is, thus, a\nconservative representation exaggerating the phase delay. If the\ncontroller gains are determined to ensure the model to be stable,\nthe practical system will always be stable. The transfer function\nthat has the corner frequency and approximates the amplitude\nover the whole frequency range is\n(10)\nThe first-order transfer function is suitable to derive explicitly\nthe stability region for the speed control gains; as to be shown\nin the next section. In a more general case, it is suggested that\na more complicated transfer function be used to \u201ccurve fit\u201d the\nBode plots obtained. The transfer function with known coeffi-\ncients is then used in time-domain simulation to evaluate the risk\nof sampling-induced resonance in the speed loop. This method\nwill also be briefly described in the next section using the test\ndrive system as an example.\n(7)\nRAN AND LIAO: SAMPLING-INDUCED RESONANCE IN INDUCTION MOTOR DRIVE 555\nFig. 7. Simplified speed control loop.\nFig. 8. Calculated stability region.\nV. EVALUATION OF SAMPLING-INDUCED RESONANCE\nWith the derived transfer function, the discrete speed control\nloop of the encoderless drive system is reduced in Fig. 7. Output\nof the speed controller corresponds to the torque demand which\nis scaled to give the reference torque producing current. The\nscaling factor depends on rotor flux. The following results will\ntherefore change as flux changes in field-weakening operation.\nThe speed control loop consists of a discrete PI controller whose\ngains are expressed in per unit (p.u.). For the proportional gain\n, 1 p.u. means that the torque demand equals the motor\nrated torque for a speed error which is equal to the rated speed.\nSimilarly, 1 p.u. of the integral gain produces such a\ntorque demand if the speed error lasts for a second.\nTheoretical analysis similar to that described in Section III\ncan be performed in order to assess if sampling-induced reso-\nnance will occur for a given pair of gains of the speed controller.\nThe calculated stability region of the gains is shown in Fig. 8.\nWithin the region, the discrete speed control loop is stable and\nsampling-induced resonance is prevented. As a feature of the\ndiscrete PI controller, the proportional and integral gains have\na similar effect in determining the control action at the begin-\nning of a sampling period. Suppose the sampled speed error is\n, the proportional term produces a control action according\nto , while the contribution from the integral term is\nFig. 9. Approximation of frequency response \u0001\n (j!)=\u0001I (j!).\n. Therefore, is equivalent to . The\nboundary of the stability region is, thus, determined as\n(11)\nwhere is a constant dependent on the dynamics of the system,\nwhich is approximated by the transfer function, and the sam-\npling period. From (4) and the above explanation on p.u. gains,\n(12)\nFor the test drive system, the value of is calculated to be 17.6\np.u. which was used to plot the stability region shown in Fig. 8.\nThe resonance shown earlier in Fig. 2 was captured with\nset to 20 p.u. and set to 100 p.u.. As far as the sampling-\ninduced resonance is concerned, the overall effect of the speed\ncontrol gains was , i.e. 20.5 p.u. for\n. The gains were, thus, outside the stability region and the\nsystem was unstable.\nThe following transfer function can be used to better \u201ccurve\nfit\u201d the frequency response shown in Fig. 6. The comparison of\nBode plots is shown in Fig. 9. Higher order functions can be used\nto improve the agreement. The transfer function is used in a dis-\ncrete time-domain simulation with progressively increased con-\ntrol gains. Unstable response is observed after\nbecomes greater than 20 p.u.. Compared with the previous\nvalue of 17.6 p.u., the stability region is enlarged confirming\nthat the first order representation previously used was indeed\nconservative. Fig. 8 also compares the stability region obtained\nusing different models and measurement; second-order repre-\nsentation gives a closer result to the measurement\n(13)\nFig. 10 shows the time-domain measurement when the speed\nloop control gains are set so that ,\nclearly outside the stability region. The sampling-induced res-\nonance is unstable. Compared with Fig. 2, the resonance is of\n556 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 51, NO. 3, JUNE 2004\nFig. 10. Sustained resonance outside the stability region.\nhigher amplitude because the control action determined at the\nbeginning of a sampling period is bigger for the same speed\nerror. As the output torque demand of the speed controller is\nsubject to internal limitation in the controller, the resonance sus-\ntains. The torque demand which is determined by the sampled\nspeed error remains constant within a sample.\nNote that for the same drive system, the derived transfer func-\ntion is related to a particular operating point, and the gains in the\ncurrent controller and speed observer. If the operating point and\nthe gains have changed, the stability region for the speed loop\nshould also be updated. Increasing the gains in the speed ob-\nserver will generally increase the risk of sampling-induced res-\nonance in the speed loop. As long as resonance is avoided, the\ngains can be optimized to improve the dynamic response [12,\npp. 224\u2013258].\nVI. EFFECT OF A SMOOTHING FILTER\nExtra smoothing filtering is not often used in drive systems\nfor the speed feedback. However, the above analysis suggests\nthat in encoderless operation, the estimated speed can contain\nsignificant ripple which is induced by the sampling process in\nthe controller. It is, thus, expected that filtering added in the\nspeed loop could attenuate the resonance and, hence, extend the\nstability region. Based on the first-order transfer function previ-\nously used to approximate the system response, analysis can be\ncarried out to show the effect of a smoothing filter prior to sam-\npling the estimated speed. The filter is supposed to be of first\norder with a time constant and unity dc gain. Then, the new\nstability limit can be obtained as given below\n(14)\nFig. 11 plots this stability limit of as\na function of the filter time constant. Fig. 12 shows the mea-\nsurement with and ,\ni.e., outside the original but within the new stability region. The\nFig. 11. Effect of smoothing filter.\nFig. 12. Measurement with smoothing filter.\nresponse is stable. Approximated in first order, the time con-\nstant of the system is . The stability limit with\nthe filter is according to Fig. 12 or (14); the smoothing\nfilter has increased system stability. The effect of the smoothing\nfilter agrees with a general rule in the design of digital control\nsystems: the signal to be sampled should be limited in a band-\nwidth which is half of the sampling frequency [4, pp. 63\u201368].\nThe present study provides further insight regarding the prac-\ntical application of such a rule: even the signal is expected to\nbe smooth\/constant, the sampling process itself can introduce\nripple which can cause sustained resonance through feedback\nin the system.\nIn a drive system having an encoder, the shaft moment of in-\nertia is inherently a low-pass filter to the speed signal. Therefore,\nno further filtering is required. The above analysis shows that an\nadditional smoothing filter can be compulsory for an encoder-\nless drive system and the stability region of the speed control\ngains depends greatly on the filter bandwidth.\nThis paper has analyzed one mechanism of sampling-induced\nresonance. It is believed that other mechanisms can also exist\nwhich will cause the same effect in an encoderless drive. For\nthe test drive system used in this study, the response of the es-\ntimated speed follows the change of the torque cur-\nrent demand in a way similar to a first-order system: if\nthe torque current demand undergoes a sudden increase, the es-\ntimated speed will follow the increase due to the integrator. In\nRAN AND LIAO: SAMPLING-INDUCED RESONANCE IN INDUCTION MOTOR DRIVE 557\na general encoderless drive, the dynamics of the speed observer\ncan be more complicated [9]. In some systems, there could exist\nthe risk for the estimated speed to be sampled too soon at each\ntime step, i.e., before the initial transient having decayed. The\nanalysis presented in this paper can be extended to different sit-\nuations.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThis paper has analyzed the sampling-induced resonance in\nan encoderless vector controlled induction motor drive. An an-\nalytical method was proposed to evaluate the risk of sustained\nresonance and predict the stability limit corresponding to the\noperating point and the settings of the internal current controller\nand speed observer. It is shown that, due to the \u201closs\u201d of moment\nof inertia, resonance at half sampling frequency of the speed\ncontrol loop can occur and an additional smoothing filter may\nbe necessary for the speed feedback in the encoderless drive.\nThe proposed method can be used to evaluate the stabilizing ef-\nfect of the filter and help to determine the suitable proportional\nand integral gains in the speed controller.\nIt is expected that the study will help drive system designers\nand operators to recognize a special requirement of encoder-\nless operation. This is particularly important for general drives\nwhich can be configured to operate in both encoder and encoder-\nless modes.\nAPPENDIX\nTEST SYSTEM PARAMETERS\nMachine parameters:\nvoltage 415 V, 50 Hz;\nspeed 153.5 rad\/s;\n0.168 ;\n249 ;\n0.1113 ;\n2;\npower 22 kW;\nrated torque 143.3 N m;\n1.124 mH;\n42.5 mH;\n1.931 mH;\nstator star connection.\nCurrent controller gains:\n3.0288 V\/A;\n909 V\/(A s).\nSpeed observer gains:\n0.0277(rad\/s)\/V;\n178(rad\/s)\/(V s).\nSpeed control gains (default values):\n5 p.u.;\n100 p.u.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.
