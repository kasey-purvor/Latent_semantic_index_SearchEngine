So, somebody comes along and will fill those dead corpses\nwith something that is believed to be identity or feelings? For me they are artificially normed\nidentities, perhaps even desires\u2026 (Eleanor, weblog posting)1\nStudents immersed in Second Life and other virtual worlds quite regularly describe such\nenvironments in terms of their \u2018deathliness\u2019, their blurring of the boundary between fantasy\nand reality, and their foregrounding of issues to do with identity which move beyond the\nweird ontology of the avatar to the nature of being as a learner across the digital and\nmaterial domains. Such concerns connect directly with the theme of \u2018uncanniness\u2019 which\nthis paper will explore.\nThe theory of the uncanny has gained a new significance in the last few decades, with a\nresurgence of interest in the theme in literary and cultural theory (for example Kristeva\n1991; Castle 1995; Arnzen 1997; Grenville 2002; Tie 2004), robotics (Mori 1970; Ramey\n2005) and technology studies (for example Johnson 1999; Weight 2006). There are few\nexplicit examples of its application in education, however, with Carrington (2005) being an\nimportant exception.\nHere, I will draw together insights from students who are actively using virtual worlds\nas learners, with a theoretical framework drawn largely from Freud\u2019s (1919\/2003) under-\nstanding of the nature of the uncanny. I will then extend this into a discussion of the nature\nof higher education (HE), drawing on Barnett\u2019s (2005, 2007) concern with the \u2018ontological\nshift\u2019 in HE, and on other constructions of higher education which emphasise the necessity\nof its troublesomeness (Perkins 2006; Meyer and Land 2005, 2006) and its immersion of\nlearners in productive states of uncertainty (Royle 2003). I will end by suggesting that\n*Email: sian.bayne@ed.ac.uk\n198  S. Bayne\nSecond Life and other virtual worlds may function as spaces where a positive \u2018pedagogy of\nuncertainty\u2019 (Barnett 2007, 137) may be explored and conducted by learners and teachers\nin higher education.\nMethod\nSome of the research data presented here are drawn from a Higher Education Academy-\nfunded project which conducted a virtual ethnography of three formal courses in higher\neducation which were using social networking technologies.2 The virtual ethnographic\nmethodology involved the research associate on the project being immersed in the day-to-\nday online and offline interactions of approximately 100 learners in three formal degree\nprogrammes spanning undergraduate and postgraduate levels in two large Scottish univer-\nsities. These programmes included full-time undergraduate students in Divinity and Design\nEngineering and part-time postgraduate distance learners at Masters level. Data were gener-\nated from student weblogs (produced as part of the assessed element of their programme of\nstudy), wikis and course discussion boards, and also through online and offline interviews\nwith students and teachers (see Hemmi, Bayne, and Land in press). The interviews took\nplace across a range of environments including online chat, Second Life, telephone and\nface-to-face sessions. Additional data given here effectively extend this project, being\ndrawn from the textual and thematic analysis of weblogs and discussion board postings of\nstudents on the University of Edinburgh\u2019s MSc in E-learning.3 The students quoted here are\nall mature postgraduates, and are in general describing experiences as relative newcomers\nto virtual worlds.\nScenes of the uncanny\nWhat do we mean when we talk about the \u2018uncanny\u2019? Though the uncanny can create fear,\nit is something which goes beyond the simply frightening: \nThe uncanny is ghostly. It is concerned with the strange, weird and mysterious, with a flicker-\ning sense (but not conviction) of something supernatural. The uncanny involves feelings of\nuncertainty, in particular regarding the reality of who one is and what is being experienced.\nSuddenly one\u2019s sense of oneself \u2026 seems strangely questionable. \u2026 It is a crisis of the natural,\ntouching upon everything that one might have thought was \u2018part of nature\u2019: one\u2019s own nature,\nhuman nature, the nature of reality and the world. But the uncanny is not simply an experience\nof strangeness or alienation. More specifically, it is a peculiar commingling of the familiar and\nunfamiliar. \u2026 As a crisis of the proper and natural, it disturbs any straightforward sense of\nwhat is inside and what is outside. The uncanny has to do with a strangeness of framing and\nborders, an experience of liminality. (Royle 2003, 1)\nFreud\u2019s essay on the theme, originally published in 1919 as \u2018Das Unheimliche\u2019 (literally,\nthe \u2018unhomely\u2019), constructs the psychology of the uncanny in terms of the way in which\nit involves the return of something long repressed, which was once familiar. These may\nbe childhood complexes, or the \u201cremnants of animistic mental activity\u201d (Freud 1919\/\n2003, 147) \u2013 hangovers from an earlier stage of cultural development in which the\nreturn of the dead, the supernatural, and the strangeness of other parallel worlds were\nbelieved in as real possibilities, in a way which contemporary accounts of the rational\nhave disallowed.\nFreud describes several situations in which the uncanny might emerge, which connect\nwell with Royle\u2019s account quoted above: the fear of death and ghosts; the questioning of the\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   199\nnature of the human inherent in instances of animation and automation; the questioning of\nthe nature of selfhood which emerges via the theme of the \u2018double\u2019 or doppelganger; and \u2013\nmost crucial to the argument presented here \u2013 the association of the uncanny with the theme\nof intellectual uncertainty and the blurring of the boundary between fantasy and reality. It\nis not hard to see here the link with virtual worlds and the ways of being they embody. In\nthe section which follows, I will expand briefly on each of these themes, connecting them\nwith quotes from students which hint at the \u2018uncanniness\u2019 of the learner experience of\nvirtual worlds.\nDeath and ghostliness\n\u201cTo many people,\u201d Freud tells us, \u201cthe acme of the uncanny is represented by anything to\ndo with death, dead bodies, revenants, spirits and ghosts\u201d (148). In the research described\nhere, it was striking how regularly the theme of \u2018deathliness\u2019 emerged in student accounts\nof entering and negotiating virtual worlds (in this case, generally Second Life). The quote\nfrom Eleanor with which I began this paper described the \u2018corpse\u2019-like nature of the avatar\nin which identity, and even desire, is artificially normed by the technological environment.\nHere, the avatar is constructed as zombie, as a carcass re-animated in the interplay between\nuser and environment. For other students, the experience of entering the virtual world is\nitself like one of dying. In the quotes that follow, Margaret describes her experience during\nan induction session in Second Life run as part of the MSc in E-learning at Edinburgh,\nwhile Maisie reflects on identity issues in the virtual world as part of an end-of-course\nassignment: \nSometimes trees block my view and I can\u2019t see where I am. It almost felt like a blind person\nmoving around in an unknown territory without the white stick. Since our meeting place was\nso close to the sea I was really worried of drowning because of this time delay. That is another\nexperience that I could not even begin to describe. It truly gives you an out of the body expe-\nrience with unshakable feelings of getting lost, drowning and even dying. (Margaret, weblog\nposting)\nVirtual worlds\u2019 challenging disassociation of identity from the physical body in exchange for\nthe graphic or text media of the screen can seem at best like going inside a cartoon and in the\nworst of cases like going through a type of physical death only to awake in the other world with\nall of one\u2019s senses intact. (Maisie, essay extract)\nFor Cara, however, \u2018ghostliness\u2019 emerges in quite a different way, being more to do with\nthe opportunities for embodied, real-life \u2018lurkers\u2019 to be present in Second Life yet invisible\n\u2013 \u2018looking over the shoulder\u2019 of the user at the keyboard: \nEmbodied people can\u2019t lurk \u2013 they have presence. However, it occurred to me afterwards that\nthere may well be disembodied lurkers in SL, as we show our RL colleagues what is going on\non screen. I\u2019ve done this a couple of times. I didn\u2019t do it during our tutorial, but I might have\n\u2013 and now I\u2019m questioning the ethics of this. (Cara, weblog posting)\nIn the kind of reversal which is typical in the operations of the uncanny, the \u2018ghost\u2019 here\nbecomes, not the avatar as in Eleanor\u2019s account, but the real-life person \u2013 the living body of\nthe \u2018colleague\u2019. The theme of ontological disorientation which pervades these accounts\nextends across each \u2018scene of the uncanny\u2019 being unfolded here, and will be returned to\nlater in terms of its connection to the \u2018ontological shift\u2019 in higher education (Barnett 2005,\n2007).\n200  S. Bayne\nAnimation, automation and insanity\nAn \u201cexcellent case\u201d of the uncanny, according to Freud, is one highlighted by Jentsch\n(1906) in his early essay on the psychology of the Unheimlich. This is to do with animation\nand the appearance of life in the inanimate \u2013 in some senses a return to the zombie theme,\nwhich raises \u201cdoubt as to whether an apparently animate object really is alive and,\nconversely, whether a lifeless object might not perhaps be animate\u201d. Freud goes on: \nIn this connection [Jentsch] refers to the impressions made on us by waxwork figures, inge-\nniously constructed dolls and automata. To these he adds the uncanny effect produced by\nepileptic fits and the manifestations of insanity, because these arouse in the onlooker vague\nnotions of automatic \u2013 mechanical \u2013 processes that may lie hidden behind the familiar image\nof a living person. (Freud 1919\/2003, 135)\nThe in-between status of the avatar \u2013 a \u2018doll\u2019 invested to some extent with the interactional\nand personality characteristics of the \u2018real\u2019 user \u2013 encapsulates in its very existence something\nof this aspect of the uncanny. Add to this the ability to automate movement via animation\n(to enable the avatar to dance, to wave, to kiss, to embrace) and the disorienting blur between\nlife and lifelessness becomes even more foregrounded. The existence of \u2018bots\u2019 in-world,\navatars controlled by code rather than by a living user, adds a further layer. When the anima-\ntion and coding \u2018goes wrong\u2019 and the avatar is caught in a mechanised, repetitive loop of\nmovement, the effect is without doubt uncanny as the appearance of contingent reality upon\nwhich our tolerance and understanding of the virtual world rests is shaken and disrupted.\nThe \u2018manifestations of insanity\u2019 associated with this aspect of the uncanny are intrigu-\ningly described in an account given by Maisie of an encounter \u2013 the time in The Palace (a\n2D virtual world) \u2013 with an unknown avatar. Maisie describes staying behind in The Palace\nafter a tutorial, to continue to chat with another student, Fiona. She describes how their chat\nis interrupted by a strange avatar called \u2018happy birthday\u2019: \nWe carried on talking and then it said; \u201cI have loads of goat cheese and I want to give it to you\u201d.\nI thought, \u201cWhat on earth is this? Is it drugs he is offering or something else? Is he just a\nlooney?\u201d We did not say anything. \u2018happy birthday\u2019 went on saying even more incoherently:\n\u201coh, Lord JJJJesus\u201d \u2013 with repeated \u2018J\u2019s \u2013 \u201cI have loads of goat cheese and it\u2019s not evil\u201d, or\nsomething like that. At that point I thought, \u201cOh dear, I\u2019d better leave this place now, this is\ngetting a bit much\u201d.\nTen or fifteen seconds went by \u2013 I had not left because I was a little \u2018puzzled\u2019 by all that \u2013 and\nthen \u2018happy birthday\u2019, moving slightly towards us \u2026 said: \u201cGod, save Lord JJJesus, the devil\nis not here, I have all of this goat cheese that I want to give to you\u2026\u201d. Silence and then Fiona\nsaid \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d. I told Fiona I would see her later and left. I was afraid!\nThe fact that \u2018it\u2019 got closer to me made me really uneasy. So uneasy, that \u2018I\u2019 did not even care\nabout leaving \u2018Fiona\u2019 with \u2018it\u2019 alone. After logging out, I found the whole experience strange,\nunexpected and totally unbelievable! \u2026 What I found unbelievable was the level of immersion\nin which my real \u2018I\u2019 was. In spite of having a third person view of the whole incident, the\nvirtual being actually managed to scare the Real Maisie \u2013 to the point that she pulled her virtual\nrepresentation out of the Chess Room. \u2026 The most shocking thing for me was the impact that\nits language and its use of silence and space had on me. (Maisie, weblog posting)\nThe double\nThe doppelganger is perhaps one of the most pervasive and compelling instances of the\nuncanny, and the most indicative of the kind of ontological uncertainty we engage with\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   201\nwhen we work within virtual worlds. To enter the virtual world as a user (rather than as one\nof Cara\u2019s \u2018ghostly\u2019 onlookers), we are obliged to construct an avatar, to engage with the\nprospect of our own \u2018double\u2019 which, \u201cin all its nuances and manifestations\u201d (Freud 1919\/\n2003, 141) encapsulates something of the uncanny: \nThis relationship [between \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018double\u2019] is intensified by the spontaneous transmission\nof mental processes from one of these persons to the other \u2013 what we would call telepathy \u2013 so\nthat the one becomes co-owner of the other\u2019s knowledge, emotions and experience. Moreover,\na person may identify himself with another and so become unsure of his true self; or he may\nsubstitute the other\u2019s self for his own. The self may thus be duplicated, divided and inter-\nchanged. (Freud 1919\/2003, 141)\nIt is perhaps in this foregrounding of the nature of selfhood that some of the most powerful\npedagogical possibilities of virtual worlds lie. As one tutor commented, \u201cIf one wants to\nexplore virtuality \u2026 it does not seem appropriate to commit oneself to being one thing\u201d\n(Michael, interview). Yet it is here that the most disquieting effects of the virtual also appear\n\u2013 when we work in virtual worlds, we are never entirely able to \u2018fix\u2019 the identity of the\nperson with whom we are interacting. In Second Life tutorials, the identities of tutor and\nstudents are largely unconnected to their \u2018real life\u2019 equivalents \u2013 each member of the class\nis \u2018doubled\u2019 in a disorienting yet exhilarating context of interaction.\nFor some students, this sense of ontological \u2018play\u2019 has a profound pedagogical value.\nMargaret describes the experience of being metaphorically embodied in class Second Life\ntutorial sessions in the following way: \nWe like to experiment with the appearance of the avatar and through experimentation I think\nwe can gain some understanding of who we really are. Philosophically, I think finding\nourselves or who we really are, is the ultimate learning experience and all that we do in our\nlifetime contributes to it.\n\u2026\nI think that the feeling of presence counts a lot in SL because otherwise it would be just like a\nnormal chat session. It is what we do with our avatars and how we react to people and other\nsituations that matter most in SL, I think. So I would say that our identities are more real when\nexpressed though an avatar. (Margaret, weblog posting)\nFor others, it is deeply disturbing. For instance Joe, a co-student of Margaret\u2019s, describes\nthe basis of an unease with virtual worlds in terms of cultural specificity and religious belief: \nThe appearance of an avatar may sadly be a \u2018put-off\u2019 for those with which it interacts. Our\nperception of attractive and acceptable varies quite a lot and colour mix of \u2018clothing\u2019 or type\nof face chosen by one (avatar) may put the other off and lead to creation of \u2018dislikes\u2019. Choice\nof animal heads for avatar faces may send a terribly wrong message in my culture. Such an\navatar may be considered a sorcerer or witch\/wizard. Who would want to interact with such a\n\u2018person\u2019?\nThere is also some possibility of offending some people\u2019s religious inclination, e.g. suggesting\nidolatry. The Bible \u2026 teaches that we are made in God\u2019s image and if one adopts the image or\nlooks of an animal then s\/he is adopting the image of an idol hence s\/he is practising idolatry!\nIt is even worse in cases where a person considers the animal face to represent their identity\nbetter than their real face. (Joe, weblog posting)\nBoth Margaret and Joe comment on the notion of the \u2018double\u2019 or the representation gaining\na reality-status in the mind of the user which is greater than that of the embodied self. The\n202  S. Bayne\nrelation between \u2018copy\u2019 and \u2018original\u2019, \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018double\u2019 is thoroughly disturbed. For\nMargaret, this is a valued and profound aspect of avatar pedagogy. For Joe, it is a deeply\nproblematic instance of the challenge the virtual world might pose to existing religious\nbelief.\nIntellectual uncertainty\nThe final scene of the uncanny which I wish to explore here is the one which is perhaps most\ncrucial to the arguments which follow. This is the notion of the uncanny \u2013 proposed by\nJentsch (1906), questioned by Freud (1919\/2003), but highlighted as central by later theo-\nrists (for example Royle 2003; Haughton 2003) \u2013 as being to do with intellectual uncertainty\nand the disquietude which occurs when \u201cthe boundaries between imagination and reality are\nerased\u201d (Kristeva 1991, 188).\nThe strange, dream-like nature of the virtual world, in which reality and imagination\nbecome inseparable, was commented on by several students. The following students all\ndescribe their early experiences with Second Life, prior to formal tutorial sessions on the\nMSc in E-learning: \n[1:00] Dark Roly: Its really weird,\n[1:00] You: Second life?\n[1:01] Dark Roly: Yes. Its fun but sort of weird, I can see why it becomes addictive.\n[1:01] You: In what way d\u2019you find it weird?\n[1:02] Dark Roly: Communicating via an avatar, sort of real and not real all at the same time.\n(Dark, conversation in-world)\nThe wind sounds in the background tend to make it feel like this is a dream or at least all\nhappening in your head. When someone makes a sound then it really stands out like a banshee\nwailing in the night. (Simon, weblog posting)\nOn Tuesday evening (night before last) I went on to Second Life (or should that be *into*). It\nloaded fine at five o\u2019clock and [my children] changed my clothes for me, so they now no longer\nbelieve that this course is hard work and want to know when they can come to play in\nMummy\u2019s dreamworld as they call it. (Gillian, weblog posting)\nKey to understanding this aspect of the uncanny is the idea that in the blurring of the bound-\nary between fantasy and reality the relation between the sign (in our case, the avatar) and\nwhat it apparently signifies (the selfhood of the user) shifts and becomes problematic.\nKristeva (1991), quoting Freud (1919\/2003, 150), describes this well: \nWhat brings together all these symbolic processes \u2026 lies in a weakening of the value of signs\nas such and of their specific logic. The symbol ceases to be a symbol and \u201ctakes over the full\nfunction of the thing it symbolizes\u201d. In other words, the sign is not experienced as arbitrary but\nassumes a real importance. As a consequence, the material reality that the sign was commonly\nsupposed to point to crumbles away to the benefit of imagination, which is no more than \u201cthe\nover-accentuation of psychical reality in comparison with material reality\u201d. (Kristeva 1991, 186)\nIn other words, the \u2018uncanniness\u2019 of the avatar may rest partly in its tendency to be perceived\nas \u201ctaking over the full function\u201d of the real-life user and his or her embodied selfhood. The\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   203\n\u2018psychical reality\u2019 of the avatar becomes privileged above the \u2018material reality\u2019 of the user.\nThis, in turn, relates back to the ontological anxiety foregrounded in many of the\nstudent accounts presented here and engages in the notion of intellectual uncertainty\nsurrounding the nature of being in the virtual world. For Jentsch, it is this intellectual\nuncertainty which is \u201cthe essential condition for the emergence of a sense of the uncanny\u201d\n(Freud 1919\/2003, 125).\nI wish now to expand on this theme of intellectual uncertainty, by exploring ways in\nwhich the strange, the troublesome, the ontological, the uncertain \u2013 in fact, the uncanny \u2013\ncan be seen to be integral to the idea of a \u2018genuine\u2019 higher education.\nThe \u2018uncanniness\u2019 of higher education\nIn exploring the possibility of a theory of \u2018haunted teaching\u2019, Royle (2003) \u2013 drawing on\nFreud and the notion of the uncanny \u2013 describes the pure necessity of intellectual uncer-\ntainty as the basis of a high quality university teaching: \nIntellectual uncertainty is not necessarily or simply a negative experience, a dead-end sense of\nnot knowing or of indeterminacy. It is just as well an experience of something open, generative,\nexhilarating (the trembling of what remains undecidable). I wish to suggest that \u2018intellectual\nuncertainty\u2019 is in part what Freud\u2019s essay has to teach and, indeed, that this is a crucial dimen-\nsion of any teaching worthy of the name. (52)\nThe ontological uncertainty foregrounded in the student accounts given here perhaps simply\nindicates that Second Life and other virtual worlds materialise this uncertainty in new ways\n\u2013 they defamiliarise our sense of selfhood and our mode of being together within the peda-\ngogical context, and in doing so ask us to reflect on it afresh as teachers and learners.\nBarnett\u2019s (2007) text, subtitled \u2018Being a Student in an Age of Uncertainty\u2019, highlights\nthe centrality to the contemporary student of the kind of intellectual indeterminacy\ndescribed by Royle. For Barnett \u201cthe uncertainty principle reaches deeply into the student\u2019s\nbeing\u201d (127), and one of the prime goals of a genuine higher education must be to help\nstudents become able to accept and live in a positive way with the kind of intellectual uncer-\ntainty which is integral to a life informed by academic ways of thinking and practising.\nSuch a way of thinking is almost inevitably uncomfortable and anxiety-inducing. Indeed,\nfor Barnett, \u201ca pedagogical achievement of higher education is that \u2013 on the student\u2019s part\n\u2013 of coming to live purposefully with anxiety\u201d (36, original emphasis). A connection might\nbe made here with the notion of \u2018troublesome knowledge\u2019 described by Perkins (1999, 2006)\n\u2013 the \u201critual knowledge, inert knowledge, conceptually difficult knowledge, foreign knowl-\nedge, and tacit knowledge\u201d (2006, 37) which may induce in students a sense of anxiety\nand disorientation, appearing \u201ccounter intuitive, alien \u2026, or incoherent\u201d (Meyer and Land\n2006, 9). For Meyer and Land, such troublesome knowledge is itself implicated in the notion\nof \u2018threshold concepts\u2019, which suggests that there is an ontological dimension to the way in\nwhich students come to negotiate \u2013 though not necessarily resolve \u2013 such areas of difficulty\nand uncertainty. In negotiating a threshold concept, the perception of the student undergoes\na \u201csignificant shift \u2026 [which] may lead to a transformation of personal identity, a\nreconstruction of subjectivity\u201d (7). To cross such a threshold is to experience the kind of\nliminality which Royle (2003, 1) sees as central to the experience of the uncanny (Meyer\nand Land 2005).\nThe terms emerging, therefore, in recent accounts of the process and purpose of higher\neducation \u2013 haunted teaching, troublesome knowledge, risk, anxiety, thresholds, liminality,\nuncertainty \u2013 might incline us towards an understanding of contemporary higher education\n204  S. Bayne\nas itself incorporating something of the uncanny. For Barnett (2007), in fact, the ontological\ndimension of studenthood implicitly and explicitly involved in such terms is absolutely\ncentral to an understanding of what it means to conduct higher education in the twenty-first\ncentury. Higher education, he argues, is \u201cin urgent need of an ontological turn\u201d (26), an\nunderstanding that \u201ca genuine higher education is none other than a transformation of\nbeing\u201d (38). In an age of rapid change, in which all knowledge is conceived as contestable\nand contingent, such transformation must be in terms of \u201cthe taking on of a mode of being\nfor uncertainty\u201d (39).\nTo teach, therefore, is to engage with new ontologies which make students \u2018strangers to\nthemselves\u2019 (Kristeva 1991), to immerse students in worlds of uncanny strangeness: \nThe student is perforce required to venture into new places, strange places, anxiety-provoking\nplaces. This is part of the point of higher education. If there was no anxiety, it is difficult to\nbelieve that we could be in the presence of a higher education. (Barnett 2007, 147)\nIn conclusion: virtual worlds and the \u2018pedagogy of uncertainty\u2019\nAs this paper has attempted to demonstrate, virtual worlds can, for some students, them-\nselves represent such worlds of strangeness \u2013 they can be uncanny spaces, in which new,\nanxiety-provoking yet rich understandings of the nature of being in a digital age can be\nconfronted. In some senses, the virtual world literalises the metaphorical and cognitive\n\u2018strangeness\u2019 and \u2018troublesomeness\u2019 which some of the most interesting accounts of\ncontemporary higher education describe.\nI do not suggest here that virtual worlds must be the primary location of a new higher\neducation which is concerned with the ontological. My argument is rather that such spaces\ncan be used with some students, in some contexts, as a way of working productively with\nthe \u2018strangeness\u2019 and \u2018uncanniness\u2019 of contemporary academic \u2013 and digital \u2013 ways of\nbeing. In such alluring, difficult, problematic spaces we might have new opportunities to\nnurture what Barnett refers to as a \u201cpedagogy for uncertain times\u201d: \nA pedagogy for uncertain times has itself to be uncertain. It is open, it is daring, it is risky, it\nis, itself, unpredictable \u2026 A pedagogy for uncertainty will be ontologically disturbing and\nenthralling all at once. It will be electric, as one move sparks another and in unpredictable ways\n\u2026 This pedagogy is a form of restrained anarchy; even a disciplined anarchy \u2013 with its spaces\nand its risks.
