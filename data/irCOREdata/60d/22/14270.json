The Strathclyde Learning Technology Initiative aims to support strategic\nchange in the development and use of new learning technologies to improve the quality\nand efficiency of teaching and learning within the University. In order for a major\ncultural shift in teaching and learning to take effect there are three main areas that need\nto be addressed: (i) many academics still work within a traditional teaching framework\nand believe that these methods can simply be transferred to the Web, (ii) students who\nhave been taught in a traditional teaching environment need support in acquiring new\nlearning skills for an electronic learning environment, and (iii) new methods of learning\nand teaching can only be successfully integrated within the environment of a supporting\ninfrastructure and institutional climate. These key elements are further explored,\ndrawing on the lessons learned from the implementation of the Initiative, and suggestions\nare made for ways of surmounting the barriers to the uptake of C&IT perceived by\nacademics.\nThe future of higher education\nHigher education is in a period of great cultural change, accelerated by government\nrecommendations (e.g. the Dearing Report), the introduction of tuition fees, implications\narising from the National Grid for Learning and changes within secondary education\n(DfEE, 1997). More demands are being made on students to become independent,\nreflective learners. Much of this is coming from potential employers who are also requiring\n64\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 3\ngraduates to develop other personal transferable skills such as communication via new\ntechnologies (Harvey, Moon and Geal, 1997).\nWe recently asked a group of staff developers, 'How do you envisage teaching and learning\nin five years time?' Responses included: teaching and learning via centralized resources\naccessed by C&IT, improved student access with fewer time barriers, increased emphasis\non distance and open learning, less traditional and more active learning. All of these echo\nDearing's vision of a connected learning society which 'opens up the possibility of higher\neducation programmes being offered remotely by anyone anywhere in the world' (National\nCommittee of Enquiry into Higher Education, 1997). In future students' learning and data\nmanagement will focus on the use of a personal computer as the central tool. This\ncomputer will be used not only as a diary for timetabling, but also:\n\u2022 as a means of communication (through email, text-based discussions, etc.);\n\u2022 collaboration with tutors (through videoconferencing, shared whiteboards, etc.);\n\u2022 data collection (via the WWW and specialist applications);\n\u2022 report writing (via email, bulletin boards, and Web publishing);\n\u2022 socializing (via email and videoconferencing etc.).\nThis new method of learning requires a significant cognitive transformation by both the\nstudent and teacher, a process requiring support by the university. If the potential of C&IT\nto enhance learning is to be realized fully, staff and students need to receive appropriate\ntraining and support (DfEE, 1998).\nThe Dealing Report was hailed as a 'a blend of vision and realism' by the Committee of\nVice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the UK (CVCP, 1998). However, the\nreality of teaching and learning is that most academics have themselves been participants\nin a traditional teaching and learning environment and have limited conceptions about the\nuse of the Internet for teaching and learning. Current literature highlights a major skills\ngap on the part of both teachers and learners which prevents the adoption of innovative\nteaching methods embracing C&IT (Littlejohn and Sclater, 1998). Working effectively\nwithin an integrated online learning environment requires the development not only of\npractical IT skills, but also of pedagogical skills. Teachers and learners need to be\nsupported in making the cognitive transformation from working within a traditional\nteaching and learning environment to active learning in a dynamic, integrated environment\n(Sosabowski, Herson and Loyd, 1998).\nThe Strathclyde Learning Technology Initiative aims to support cultural change in the\nadoption of new teaching and learning methodologies at the University of Strathclyde.\nThe initiative is based upon the premise that this change is best brought about by\nsupporting teachers and learners in both pedagogical and practical C&IT skills. Also in\norder for a major cultural shift in teaching and learning to take effect, there are three main\nareas which need to be addressed: staff, student and infrastructure development. These\nthree domains are inter-related. Neglecting one would have a detrimental effect on one or\nboth of the others; therefore all three must be examined simultaneously.\n65\nAllison Lialejobn and Shona Cameron Supporting strategic cultural change: the Strathdyde Learning Technology Initiative\nStaff development\nThe Dealing Report recommended that 'all institutions should review and update their\nstaff development policies to ensure they address the changing roles of staff'\n(Recommendation 47). The response from bodies such as SEDA (Staff and Educational\nDevelopment Association), which has done much to improve the status of staff\ndevelopment initiatives, was to welcome the emphasis 'on the contribution which staff\ndevelopment can and must make for a fully professionalised, accredited teaching force'\n(SEDA, 1997). Recent developments supporting staff in the use of C&IT in teaching and\nlearning at the University of Strathclyde include:\n\u2022 a program of staff development workshops;\n\u2022 two Masters level modules in a postgraduate certificate\/diploma course for the\naccreditation of HE teaching: Advanced Academic Studies;\n\u2022 the creation of a community of scholars using C&IT for teaching;\n\u2022 educational development with individual departments;\n\u2022 the provision of a resource centre to help academics use learning technologies.\nStaff development programme\nIn order to teach effectively in an online environment, academics must be given the\nopportunity to explore the differences (if any) between being an online tutor and using\nmore traditional teaching methods. A recent study identifying staff resistance to computer-\nbased teaching and learning recommended that change would best be accomplished by\nfocused demand for lead staff training enabling staff to explore these issues. This training\nwould not solely entail baseline IT training but would also change the perception of\nacademics towards C&IT as a teaching tool (Sosabowski et al., 1998). The Strathclyde staff\ndevelopment programme adopts this premise. The programme consists of a series of\ncoherent workshops aimed primarily at staff with a teaching role. Each course blends\ncurrent thinking on how to use technology effectively to enhance teaching and learning\nwith practical training. The desired outcome is to inform staff of the potential C&IT offers\nand to enable them to implement effectively new strategies for their own teaching and\nlearning. These workshops include:\n\u2022 Choosing the Right Technology;\n\u2022 Electronic Assessment;\n\u2022 Web-based Teaching;\n\u2022 Electronic Libraries and;\n\u2022 Internet Communication.\nFull details of these courses can be found at http:\/\/cvu.strath.ac.uk\/training\/.\nThe Dealing Report recommended that staff should develop learning and teaching\nstrategies which 'focus on the promotion of students' learning' (Recommendation 8). In the\nlight of this recommendation the main focus of these workshops is in supporting staff in\ndeveloping teaching and learning strategies which embrace C&IT rather than on\n66\nAir] Volume 7 Number 3\ntechnological issues. Many academics still work within a traditional teaching framework\nand have limited insight into the fact that traditional teaching methods, such as a narrative\nstyle of lecturing, cannot simply be transferred onto the Web. Therefore staff developers\nrecognize the fact that academics need to be fully immersed in the technology and to experi-\nence being in the role of a student. The result of transferring old teaching methodologies via\nnew technology must be challenged (Ryan, 1998). During this staff development pro-\ngramme the pedagogical consequences of simply 'delivering lecture notes' via the Web are\nexplored and staff are encouraged through the use of face-to-face and electronic discussions\nto think about ways of enhancing the student learning experience. Also information is\noffered on the various national and local services which are available to assist them.\nMany participants have used the staff development programme as a springboard to\nadopting C&IT in their courses and evaluation studies are currently in progress to\ndetermine the impact this programme has made on cultural change. Other support\nstrategies include educational development with individual departments (Stefani,\nLittlejohn and Guerra, 1998) and the provision of a Multimedia Resource Centre offering\ncomputers, software and advice to academic or related staff. Efforts are also being made to\ndevelop a virtual community of scholars by running special events, such as seminars with\ninvited speakers. However this has had limited impact since there is not yet a critical mass\nof lecturers at Strathclyde suitably equipped with the skills required to effect a major\ninstitution-wide shift in the teaching and learning culture of the university.\nAccredited programme\nA major strategic change within the University of Strathclyde was the development of a\ncourse for academic training of staff, in accordance with Dealing's Recommendation 13. A\nPostgraduate Certificate\/Diploma course entitled 'Advanced Academic Studies' for\nacademic and related staff for the purpose of accreditation of teaching and learning\nactivities is now being offered. This course includes two optional modules at Scottish\nMasters level in 'Web-based Teaching' and 'Internet Communication'. These involve the\ndesign and creation of Web-based course material and provide the participant with the\nnecessary skills for using the Web for teaching and learning. As well as hands-on\nworkshops, the course includes a significant amount of online study and discussion of the\npedagogical issues of using new technology to enhance teaching and learning. The\nmodules blend pedagogical and practical skills. Learning via new technologies helps\nparticipants to develop new strategies for their teaching. Participants are placed in the role\nof online learners and are encouraged to exchange ideas to enable them to explore and\nexperiment with working online. This view that academics must have the opportunity to\nexperience the teaching and learning process within a safe environment is echoed by other\nstaff developers (Ryan, 1998).\nStudent development\nStudents who have been taught in a traditional teaching environment need support in\nacquiring new learning skills to cope with an electronic learning environment. Recent\nefforts to enhance the student learning experience have focused on ensuring that students\ndevelop not only knowledge and understanding within a disciplinary context but also a\nrange of personal transferable skills. Key skills highlighted in the Dearing Report include\ncommunication and the use of information technology (Recommendation 21).\n67\nAllison Uttlefihn and Shona Cameron Supporting strategic cultural change the Strathclyde Learning Technology Initiative\nInformation literacy skills training programme\nStrathclyde University has taken a major step forward in introducing a training\nprogramme to support students in the development of personal transferable IT skills. The\ninformation literacy skills training programme for undergraduates aims to enable\nresponsible and effective use of available technologies. This programme is being run in\ncollaboration with the University of Glasgow, which has made attainment to an IT\nbaseline level compulsory for all undergraduates (Martin, 1997).\nThe IT Induction Programme covers a range of basic computing skills: basic familiarity\nwith graphical user interfaces, general housekeeping, using electronic mail, simple use of\nword processing and spreadsheets to using online library catalogues, and Internet\nsearching. The programme has been delivered within the curriculum to first-year\nundergraduates in various academic departments, both by academic staff and by trained\npostgraduate tutors. There are several ways of reaching the IT skills baseline:\n\u2022 A basic IT course is offered in six two-hourly sessions aimed at students with little\nexperience of computers.\n\u2022 An IT orientation course, incorporating four two-hourly sessions, is aimed at students\nwith experience of using computers, but who are not necessarily familiar with the\nsystems and software in common use in Higher Education.\n\u2022 There is also an assessment-only route for skilled users of IT.\nEnsuring that all students have basic IT skills means that departments can then progress\nfurther with the use of IT in the curriculum, concentrating on more advanced applications.\nLearning support for students with disabilities\nA recent HEFCE report (HEFCE, 1999) stresses the need to evaluate developments in IT\nand their impact on teaching regimes. This fully reiterates Dealing's recommendation to\nprovide 'learning support for students with disabilities' (Recommendation 6). The\nappointment of a special needs technology support officer is allowing support for students\nwith different types of disabilities via individual support and advice about adaptive\ntechnologies for personal study, hands-on workshops, drop-in sessions and special events.\nC&IT is already playing an important role in ensuring that the university curriculum can\nbe accessible to all potential students. The range of adaptive technologies available is\ncontinuing to expand and this, coupled with the development of appropriate courseware,\nenables those previously disadvantaged to consider university study.\nIn response to Dealing's recommendation to provide 'learning support for students with\ndisabilities' (Recommendation 6), the university is widening access to the curriculum\nthrough the appointment of a special needs technology support officer. The aim is to\nsupport students with different types of disabilities via hands-on workshops, drop-in\nsessions, special events and individual support and advice about adaptive technologies for\npersonal study. C&IT is already playing an important role in ensuring that the university\ncurriculum can be accessible to all potential students.\nSupporting students in developing new learning strategies\nDealing's vision that C&IT will be central to the student's learning experience requires the\ndevelopment of new learning strategies and wider student access to computers. Presently\n68\nALT-] Vb\/ume 7 Number 3\nstudent support is offered in the form of a C&IT Literacy Skills Programme which does\nnot adequately address pedagogical and social requirements. In order to make the\nnecessary cognitive transformation from being a traditional learner to learning within a\nfully integrated online learning environment students must be supported in developing new\nlearning strategies. Pilot studies aimed at encouraging and supporting students in adopting\nnew learning strategies and developing personal transferable skills are currently being\ndeveloped. One interesting example of this was with students on an M.Sc. course in Energy\nSystems and the Environment. As part of their group projects students on this course were\nrequired to develop and maintain Project Management Logs using the Web as the key\nmedium. Not only did this enable them to acquire the necessary IT skills to communicate\nvia the Web, but they also developed additional personal transferable skills enabling them\nto work as reflective learners (Stefani et ah, 1998). This initiative serves as a model for\nfuture teaching and learning. Clearly more emphasis in this area must be made and\nsupported at the highest level within the institution and resources targeted towards\ndeveloping an effective infrastructure.\nInfrastructure development\nIn its report, the National Committee urges the design and use of materials which exploit\nthe potential of C&IT for innovation in learning. These new materials can only be\nsuccessfully integrated within the environment of a supporting infrastructure and\ninstitutional climate. The communication of high-quality teaching materials via high-speed\nnetworks is essential to the realization of Dearing's vision. All the west of Scotland HEIs\n(Higher Education Institutions) are integral partners in the ClydeNet Metropolitan Area\nNetwork, a broadband network linking all the west of Scotland HE institutions. Now\nefforts are being made to create an integrated virtual learning environment to enable\nacademics to exploit the potential of this broadband network for teaching and learning.\nTeaching and learning methodologies initiative\nAs a result of a strategic review exercise in 1997, the University of Strathclyde decided to\nencourage the development of a wider range of teaching methods and materials. The\nTeaching and Learning Methodologies Initiative (TLML http:\/\/www.strath.ac.uk\/ces\/tlmi)\nrepresents a significant investment by the university to develop and implement innovative\nteaching methodologies across all faculties. All projects supported are using new com-\nmunications technologies in various ways to enhance the traditional curriculum.\nFor example, the New Approaches to Teaching and Learning in Engineering (NATALIE)\nproject has completely restructured the first year of a traditional mechanical engineering\ncourse consisting of lectures, labs and tutorials, into a new course given in an extensively\nrefurbished lecture theatre, known as 'The Interactive Classroom'. This room is equipped\nwith two classroom communication systems, one using graphics calculators and the other\nsmall handsets (similar to TV channel changers) which are infrared based. These\ntechnologies support the peer instruction approach to interactive teaching (Mazur, 1997)\nwhich concentrates on actively involving students in the learning process. During a\nteaching session, students are prompted to reflect on their comprehension of concepts in\norder to identify weaknesses in their understanding. This process of reflection aids in\nconcept learning as well as encouraging discussion amongst students, leading to a better\nunderstanding overall (Davis, 1997): This form of collaborative learning facilitates group\n69\nA\/feon Uttlejohn and Shorn Cameron Supporting strategic cultural change the Strathclyde Learning Technology Initiative\nwork, thereby equipping the students with transferable skills useful for future employment\n(Harvey et al, 1997). It also has the beneficial effect of helping them to settle into\nuniversity life. It has been observed that students often interact within their assigned\ngroups both academically and socially throughout the academic year.\nAnother of the TLMI projects is the Virtual Organizational Teaching Environment\n(VOTE), a major initiative within the Strathclyde Business School to promote the use of\nC&IT to improve teaching and learning in business and management. The project centres\non the development of a virtual online business environment which will form part of a core\nintegrative curriculum supporting the development and acquisition of key skills in\n(Dealing Recommendation 21): communication, numeracy, use of IT, and learning how to\nlearn.\nThe vision of the project is to revise the traditional undergraduate curriculum to\nincorporate a more radical pedagogical approach based on an interactive teaching game.\nThe game features a virtual organization and encourages students to apply their knowledge\nto a variety of simulated real-world scenarios of varying complexity, supporting a range of\npedagogical approaches from task-based to collaborative learning.\nOne major problem in developing these online teaching materials is the lack of clarity of\nInternet copyright and intellectual property right issues (Macqueen, 1997). Therefore the\nTLMI projects are advised by an Internet copyright officer, appointed to co-ordinate\ncopyright clearance for the use of third-party material in electronic resources used for\nteaching and learning within an integrated learning environment.\nIntegrated Learning Environment- Clyde Virtual University\nThe University of Strathclyde is committed to the development of an Integrated Learning\nEnvironment for teaching and assessment. This was achieved when the Clyde Virtual\nUniversity (CVU http:\/\/cvu.strath.ac.uk\/) was developed in 1995 as the first virtual\nuniversity in Europe. CVU integrates the main components of a traditional university\nsetting: lecture theatre, library, virtual cafe (for discussions), assessment hall and\nadministration office. This model provides a series of tools enabling academics in the west\nof Scotland universities to create online learning packages, assessments, evaluations and\ndiscussion groups with little technical knowledge. The Clyde Virtual University model has\nbeen used extensively in the staff development programme as a framework on which\nacademics can develop ideas for their own teaching. For example, in the course on Web-\nbased Teaching, academics are given the opportunity to design their own teaching\nmaterials for the lecture theatre. They are encouraged to integrate electronic assessment,\nusing the CVU assessment wizard, and discussion in the CVU cafe. This provides\nacademics with hands-on experience of an Integrated Virtual Learning Environment,\nenabling them to assess perceived benefits and barriers to the successful adoption of C&IT\nas a tool for teaching and learning.\nPerceived barriers to the adoption of C&IT\nThe use of C&IT must have a significant value-added factor either in the quality of teaching\nand learning or in the efficiency with which academic staff can use their time. However, there\nis a fear amongst academics that the use of C&IT has not yet reached the stage of being\nefficient (Ringle and Updegrove, 1998). There is therefore a reluctance among many\n70\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 3\nacademics to use technology in support of teaching and learning without an assurance of the\nlong-term benefits by long-term evaluation studies (Harvey, 1998).\nThese sentiments were echoed during discussions at a course entitled 'Supporting Teaching\nand Learning - The IT Possibilities' for probationary lecturers from the Universities of\nStrathclyde, Glasgow and Paisley. As part of the course these lecturers were asked to\nconsider individually the perceived barriers and success factors towards the adoption of\nC&IT. The participants then discussed these issues in groups, in an effort to distil common\nfactors. Each group was then asked to present the findings, which are listed in Table 1.\nBarriers to using C&IT\n\u2022 access to computing facilities\n\u2022 cost and human resources required for\ndevelopment\n\u2022 not enough staff training available for using C&IT\n\u2022 lack of proper integration into mainstream\nteaching\n\u2022 lack of diversity of educational resources\n\u2022 courses may become stagnant if material is not\nupdated\n\u2022 de-humanizing, often leading to lack of student\nengagement\n\u2022 some subjects more applicable to Web-based\nteaching than others\n\u2022 verification of student identity during exams\nSuccess factors\n\u2022 keep students informed about courses\n\u2022 student involved in active learning\n\u2022 brings real world into teaching - especially in\nconcept learning through simulations\n\u2022 effective for distance learners\n\u2022 self-paced learning suits the new style of working\nstudent\n\u2022 access to a wealth of resources\n\u2022 promotion of dialogue\n\u2022 time efficiency using electronically marked\nassessments\nTable I: Barriers and success factors relating to the use of C&IT\nThe main fears were related to a perceived lack of support in staff, student and\ninfrastructure development. These concerns were addressed at the ALT-C98: conference\nparticipants were asked their views on these issues, with the aim of sharing potential\nsolutions to drive forward the adoption of C&IT in teaching and learning. Major concerns\nincluded the resources required to develop Web-based programmes: human resources,\nequipment resources and the amount of time required. A number of studies have echoed\nthis concern that the initial time to set up a C&IT course is high, though the required input\nmay be reduced in the long term (Duffy, Arnold and Henderson, 1995). Despite the fact\nthat many tools are being developed to save lecturers time, for example in assessment (for\nexample Hunt, 1998; O'Hare, Mackenzie, O'Reilly and Wilkins, 1998) there is still a\ngrowing concern among academics as to the time required to gain the pedagogical skills to\nuse these tools. Modelling online teaching and learning by placing academics in the role of\nan online learner during staff development programmes has been shown to be an effective\nway of overcoming this barrier (Ryan, 1998).\n71\nAllison IMejohn and Shono Cameron Supporting strategic cultural change: the Strathclyde Learning Technology Initiative\nOther concerns included the wide range of skills still required to create a Web-based\ncourse, despite the fact that these technologies are rapidly becoming more accessible. The\nresponse from participants at ALT-C was that specialist support should be available within\ninstitutions. This would aid the development of short courses which could be linked\ntogether, facilitating easy updating. The funding for development could be provided in the\nfirst instance by each institution or via grants with the understanding that savings or\ncapital income would be made over time. Another suggestion was that there should be\nmuch more open sharing of resources, but perhaps this is at odds with the notion of\ncreating an income from development. The effectiveness of staff training could be\nincreased by setting up chains of peer tutoring (Cousin and Deepwell, 1998).\nThe problems of lack of diversity of educational resources, teaching material not being\nupdated and lack of human contact are inherent in the traditional lecture-based HE\nsystem and are not necessarily particular to teaching via C&IT. These problems are\nsurmountable but concerted action is essential. These issues must be clarified by evaluation\nof the use of C&IT in teaching and learning as a whole to quantify the added value of this\napproach.\nSummary\nOur research into perceived barriers to the adoption of C&IT as a tool for teaching and\nlearning illustrates that university teachers have a good understanding of the barriers to\neffective use of these technologies. Some of these barriers, such as lack of student\nengagement or the verification of student identity during exams, already exist within the\ntraditional curriculum. Therefore our notions of course and curriculum design must be\nfully reviewed and revisited, focusing on communication, presentation, numeracy, problem\nsolving and self-assessment skills. To enable the development of these higher-level skills\nusing C&IT it will be increasingly important to support students and academics in\ndeveloping information literacy skills and applying these to teaching and learning\nscenarios.\nTo effect strategic cultural change, involving the integration of new technologies within the\nacademic curriculum, the following issues have to be addressed (McCartan and Hare,\n1996):\n\u2022 commitment of support at the institutional level;\n\u2022 development of an institutional strategy with related staff development;\n\u2022 policies and programmes;\n\u2022 provision for students and academic staff to acquire enabling IT skills.\nOur findings fully support this work and acknowledge that there are still barriers to\novercome, before adoption of appropriate technology-based applications in teaching,\nlearning and assessment is commonplace. Further strategic change will require greater\ntargeting of the limited resources available for staff and student training in order to enable\nwider implementation of new teaching and learning methodologies. In the foreseeable\nfuture traditional lecture halls and computer laboratory space will merge as C&IT becomes\ncentral to the students' learning experience. Hopefully the lessons learned from the\n72\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 3\nimplementation of the Strathclyde Learning Technology Initiative model can clarify future\nobjectives in supporting strategic cultural change in UK Higher Education.\nReferences\nCousin, G. and Deepwell, F.
