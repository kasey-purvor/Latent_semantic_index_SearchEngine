INTRODUCTION \nuzzy-model-based control approach is a promising \napproach to deal with complex nonlinear systems.  It has \nbeen successfully applied in various applications.  \nRecently, fuzzy-model-based control approach has been \nemployed to synchronize chaotic systems, which is a useful \napplication in communication system to ensure a secure \ncommunication. \n In fuzzy-model-based control approach, generally, T-S \nfuzzy model [1]-[2] is employed to describe the dynamical \nbehaviors of the response and drive chaotic systems.  It was \nshown in [3]-[5] that most common chaotic systems can be \nrepresented by T-S fuzzy models with simple rules.  Based on \nthe T-S fuzzy model, a fuzzy state-feedback controller [3]-[6] is \nthen designed to realize the synchronization.  Under a design \n \nThis work was supported by the Division of Engineering, King\u2019s College \nLondon. \nH. K.

Iu is with the School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer \nEngineering, The University of Western Australia. \nS.H. Ling is with the School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer \nEngineering, The University of Western Australia. \ncriterion that the grades of membership of both response and \ndrive chaotic system are known, LMI-based exact linearization \nconditions [3], [6] were given to design a fuzzy state-feedback \ncontroller to synchronize two identical chaotic systems.  In \n[4]-[5], this design criterion was alleviated by using the H B\u221e B \ntracking control approach.  Under the approach in [4]-[5], the \ngrades of membership of the drive chaotic system are not \nnecessarily known and the tracking performance is guaranteed \nby an H B\u221e B tracking performance index.  The fuzzy-model-based \ncontrol approach has combined with adaptive ability [6]-[11] to \ndeal with chaotic systems subject to parameter uncertainties.  \nWith the outstanding approximation ability of the fuzzy \nsystem, the uncertain parameter values of the chaotic systems \ncan be estimated in an online manner according to some update \nrules.  A fuzzy controller can generate an appropriate control \naction based on the estimated parameters.  The adaptive fuzzy \napproach offers a superior robustness property, however, \ncomputational demand and structural complexity of the \ncontroller are increased.  In some operating environment, the \nsystem state information of the drive chaotic system reaches the \nresponses system with time delay owing to the long-distance \ntransmission.  Under such a situation, the current state \ninformation of the drive chaotic system cannot be obtained to \nrealize the synchronization.  In [12]-[14], synchronization \nusing time-delayed feedback control was investigated.  Linear \ncontroller using constant time-delayed system state information \nof both drive and response chaotic system, and the current \nsystem state information of response chaotic system was \nproposed to realize the synchronization.  Both time-delay \nindependent and dependent stability conditions were derived \n[12]-[14] using the Lyapunov-Krasovksii function.  This \ndelayed-feedback control approach was extended to adaptive \nfuzzy framework [15].  In [17]-[19], the synchronization of \nneural networks subject to time delay was considered. \n In this paper, a fuzzy controller is proposed to synchronize \ntwo chaotic systems.  The fuzzy controller makes use of current \nsystem state information of the response chaotic system and the \ntime-delayed system state information of the drive chaotic \nsystem to realize the synchronization.  The time delay to be \nconsidered is time varying and uncertain in value.  It is due to \nthis reason, the proposed fuzzy state-feedback controller \ncannot use the time-delayed system state information of the \nresponse chaotic system compared to the linear control \n[12]-[14] and the adaptive fuzzy control [15] approaches of \nwhich constant time delay was considered.  To cope with the \ntime-varying delay, the boundedness property of the system \nstates of the drive chaotic system is taken advantage to \ninvestigate system stability.  Furthermore, the parameter \nSynchronization of chaotic systems using \ntime-delayed fuzzy state-feedback controller \nH.K. Lam, Member, IEEE, W.K. Ling, H.H.C. Iu, Member, IEEE and S.H. Ling, Member, IEEE \nF \n 2\nuncertainties of the chaotic systems eliminate the favourable \nproperties of the fuzzy-model-based control approach to \nfacilitate the stability analysis and produce relaxed stability \nconditions [3]-[6], [12]-[15].  To alleviate the difficulties \nintroduced by parameter uncertainties, membership functions \nof both fuzzy model and fuzzy controller are considered.  \nConsequently, some free matrices are allowed to be introduced \nto the stability conditions to ease the stability analysis and \nproduce less conservative stability conditions.  LMI-based \nstability conditions are derived to aid the design of a fuzzy \ncontroller to realize the synchronization. \n This paper is organized as follows.  In section II, the fuzzy \nmodel and the time-delayed fuzzy state-feedback controller is \npresented.  In section III, system stability is investigated.  \nLMI-based stability conditions are derived to guarantee the \nsystem stability.  In Section IV, a simulation example is given \nto illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  A \nconclusion is drawn in section V. \nII. FUZZY MODEL AND TIME-DELAYED FUZZY CONTROLLER \n In this paper, we consider the scenario depicted in the block \ndiagram in Fig. 1, e.g., a communication channel.  Referring to \nthis block diagram, in the remote side, we have a drive chaotic \nsystem subject to parameter uncertainties.  The system state \n)(\u02c6 tx  of the drive chaotic system is transmitted over a channel \nto the other end.  The long distance of the communication \nchannel will introduces a time-varying delay of \u03c4 BdB(t) \u2265 0 to \n)(\u02c6 tx .  As a result, ))((\u02c6 tt d\u03c4\u2212x  is available for synchronization.  \nAs the fuzzy controller is assumed to be very close to the \nresponse system subject to parameter uncertainties, hence, the \ntime delay for the response chaotic system with the system state \nof x(t) is insignificant.  Consequently, the fuzzy controller \nrealizes the synchronization based on the timed-delayed system \nstate of ))((\u02c6 tt d\u03c4\u2212x  and current system state of x(t). \n To facilitate the system analysis and controller synthesis, \nfuzzy models are employed to represent the dynamical \nbehavior of the response and drive chaotic systems subject to \nparameter uncertainties.  A time-delayed fuzzy state-feedback \ncontroller is designed accordingly to drive the system state of \nthe response chaotic system to follow those of the drive chaotic \nsystem.  The details of the fuzzy model and fuzzy controller are \npresented in the following sub-sections. \n \nA.  Fuzzy Model \n Let p be the number of fuzzy rules describing the chaotic \nsystem subject to parameter uncertainties with control input \nterm.  The i-th rule is of the following format, \nRule i: IF ))((1 tf x  is \ni\n1M  AND \u2026 AND ))(( tf x\u03a8  is i\u03a8M  \n           THEN )()()(  ttt i uBxAx +=& , i = 1, 2, ..., p (1) \nwhere i\u03b1M  is a fuzzy term of rule i corresponding to the \nfunction ))(( tf x\u03b1  with known form, \u03b1 = 1, 2, ..., \u03a8, i = 1, 2, ..., \np, \u03a8 is a positive integer; 1)( \u00d7\u211c\u2208 ntx  is the system state vector; \nnn\ni\n\u00d7\u211c\u2208A  and mn\u00d7\u211c\u2208B  are the known constant system and \ninput matrices respectively; 1)( \u00d7\u211c\u2208 mtu  is the input vector.  \nThe system dynamics are described by, \n( ))()())(()(\n1=\ntttwt i\np\ni\ni BuxAxx += \u2211&  (2) \nwhere \n1=))((\n1\ntw\np\ni=\ni x\u2211 , [ ]10))(( \u2208twi x  for all i (3) \n( )\u2211 \u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\np\nk\ni\ntftftf\ntftftf\ntw\nkkk\niii\n1=\nM2M1M\nM2M1M\n)))((()))((()))(((\n)))((()))((()))(((\n=))((\n21\n21\nxxx\nxxx\nx\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n\u03a8\n\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\nL\nL\n (4) \nis a nonlinear function of x(t) and )))(((M tfi x\u03b1\u03b1\u03bc  is the grade \nof membership corresponding to the fuzzy terms i\u03b1M .

It should be noted that \nthere is no control input term for the drive chaotic system.

By solving the solution to the stability conditions in \nTheorem 1 using MATLAB LMI toolbox, with \u03c1 = 1 and \u03b3 = 0 \nand \u03c3 = 0.002, we have \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n=\n1174.9600796.30\n0796.31174.9623846.22\n06154.191174.951\n1G  and \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n=\n1174.9600796.30\n0769.31174.9623846.22\n06154.191174.951\n2G . \n Fig. 11 shows the tracking error between the response and \ndrive Lorenz systems with the proposed fuzzy controller in the \nform of (31).  The initial system states are set to be \n[ ]T101010)0(\u02c6 =x  and [ ]T000)0( =x .  It can be seen \nthat fuzzy controller is able to synchronize the drive and \nresponse Lorenz systems with the converge time of about \n0.006s for all eB1B(t), eB2B(t) and eB3B(t). \n Referring to Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, it can be seen that the \nproposed fuzzy controller performs better in terms of shorter \nconverge time.  Furthermore, compared to the fuzzy adaptive \nscheme in [10], it can be seen that the proposed fuzzy control \nscheme offers a simpler approach to realize the synchronization \nin terms of lower structural complexity and computational \ndemand for the response system and fuzzy controller. \n \nV. CONCLUSION \n The synchronization of chaotic systems subject to parameter \nuncertainties using timed-delayed fuzzy state-feedback \ncontroller has been investigated.  The fuzzy state-feedback \ncontroller using the system state of the response chaotic system \nand the time-delayed system state of the drive chaotic system \nhas been proposed to realize the synchronization.  To overcome \nthe analysis difficulties introduced by the system time delay \nand parameter uncertainties, first, T-S fuzzy has been employed \nto represent the chaotic systems subject to parameter \nuncertainties.  Then, the membership functions of both fuzzy \n 9\nmodel and fuzzy controller have been considered to facilitate \nthe stability analysis and produce less conservative stability \nanalysis result.  LMI-based stability conditions have been \nderived using Lyapunov-based approach to guarantee the \nsystem stability and aid the design of the time-delayed fuzzy \ncontroller.  Simulation examples have been given to illustrate \nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach. \nREFERENCES \n[1] T. Takagi and M.
