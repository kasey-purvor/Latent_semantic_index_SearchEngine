There is also a 5 \nsignificant microbial flora including photosynthetic prokaryotes, unicellular algae, and 6 \nmicrofungi, but these are currently not well described.  Plants were first discovered in 7 \nAntarctica in 1820 during Edward Bransfield\u2019s Antarctic Voyage (1819-1820), on Penguin 8 \nIsland in the South Shetland Islands (Anonymous, 1821, 1946).  The oldest existing 9 \ncollection of lichens was made by an American sealing expedition in 1820-21 (Torrey, 1823), 10 \nof mosses and flowering plants in 1829 by James Eights (Eights, 1833; Lewis Smith, 1981) 11 \nand of liverworts by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897-1899 (Stephani, 1901).  It was 12 \nnot until the first half of the twentieth century, however, that any major plant collections were 13 \nmade.  A history of bryological collections is given by Ochyra et al. (1998) and Seppelt et al. 14 \n(1998), and of lichens by \u00d8vstedal and Lewis Smith (2001).  Many checklists of individual 15 \nareas have been published, as have taxonomic treatments of individual groups of taxa.  The 16 \ntaxonomy and identification of Antarctic lichens is comprehensively covered by \u00d8vstedal and 17 \nLewis Smith (2001), of liverworts by Bednarek-Ochyra et al. (2000) and an illustrated moss 18 \nflora of Antarctica is currently in preparation. 19 \n 20 \nVarious schemes have been used to divide Antarctica into biological regions based on a 21 \ncombination of climatic and biotic characteristics (Holdgate, 1964; Pickard and Seppelt, 22 \n1984; Lewis Smith, 1984; Seppelt, 1995).  Typically the Antarctic continent is divided into 23 \ntwo zones: the first comprises the maritime Antarctic, which includes the South Sandwich 24 \nIslands, Bouvet\u00f8ya, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands and the western side of the 25 \nAntarctic Peninsula down to c. 72\u00b0S; the second comprises continental Antarctica which 26 \nincludes the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula south of 63\u00b0S, and the remainder of the 27 \ncontinent.  Lewis Smith (1984) further divided the maritime Antarctic into northern and 28 \nsouthern regions with a boundary at 66\u00b0S, and continental Antarctica into coastal, slope and 29 \nice plateau regions.  These divisions were made using fairly broad climatic or biotic features 30 \nand, while there have been studies of small areas investigating whether the pattern of species\u2019 31 \ndistributions follow this classification (Pickard and Seppelt, 1984), no such studies have been 32 \nmade for Antarctica as a whole. 33 \n 34 \n  \n3\nIn this paper we have attempted to gather together all available information on the Antarctic 1 \nflora into a single database to identify how well we know the Antarctic flora, and whether 2 \nany broad scale patterns in biodiversity exist.  We have used a database of Antarctic plant 3 \nspecimens held in herbaria worldwide (Peat, 1998), supplemented with records from the 4 \nAustralian Antarctic Division herbarium database and species occurrences recorded in the 5 \nliterature, to investigate three questions: 6 \n(1) How well do we know the flora, and what important areas are there still to explore?  7 \n(2) What large scale biogeographic or macroecological patterns are displayed in the data?  8 \n(3) Do the data throw light on the evolutionary history of the Antarctic flora? 9 \n 10 \n 11 \nMETHODS 12 \n 13 \nThe dataset 14 \nFor the purposes of this study, we include in the Antarctic macroflora any phanerogam, 15 \nbryophyte or lichen recorded from a locality south of 60\u00b0 latitude or from the South 16 \nSandwich Islands (56-60\u00b0S, 26-28\u00b0W).  Data on the Antarctic flora were taken from two 17 \nsources: records of herbarium specimens and species occurrences cited in the literature.  The 18 \nAntarctic Plant Database (APD: 19 \nhttp:\/\/www.antarctica.ac.uk\/Resources\/BSD\/PlantDatabase\/index.html) contains 31,909 20 \nrecords of specimens collected south of 60\u00b0S and held in over 50 herbaria worldwide (Peat, 21 \n1998), together with 1262 records from the South Sandwich Islands.  This database was 22 \nsupplemented with 3346 Antarctic records from the Australian Antarctic Division\u2019s 23 \nherbarium (ADT) database.  In addition, a database of literature records was constructed to 24 \nhold species identifications where a collection locality was listed; this added 2,728 records 25 \nfrom 71 publications.  To avoid duplication of data, publications citing records of specimens 26 \nthat are listed in the Antarctic Plant Database were not included in the database of literature 27 \nrecords 28 \n 29 \nBouvet\u00f8ya (54\u00b025'S, 3\u00b018'E), while generally included in the maritime Antarctic, was not 30 \nincluded in our data set because of the very limited botanical collections from this island 31 \n(Engelskj\u00f8n, 1986a).  No attempt was made to critically assess specimen determinations but, 32 \nwherever possible, current nomenclature has been used and the latest name is used for any 33 \nknown synonyms.  The identification of many specimens in the British Antarctic Survey 34 \nHerbarium (AAS) has recently been checked by D. \u00d8vstedal during the development of the 35 \n  \n4\nAntarctic lichen flora (\u00d8vstedal and Lewis Smith, 2001) or by R. Ochyra as part of the 1 \nongoing development of an illustrated moss flora of Antarctica.  However, lichen specimens 2 \ndetermined by C. W. Dodge that have not subsequently been redetermined, and any 3 \nchecklists written by Dodge, have not been included in the biodiversity analyses; this is 4 \nbecause many of the species described by Dodge are no longer accepted as valid (Castello & 5 \nNimis, 1995).  Whilst the type specimens described by Dodge have been re-examined, we 6 \nfeel it is unlikely that use of the resulting synonyms would give reliable identifications for 7 \nnon-type material.  Statistical analyses whose use requires data on the number of specimens 8 \nwere performed using only herbarium specimen data, as checklists given in the literature do 9 \nnot consistently record the number of specimens of each species that were collected. 10 \n 11 \nIce-free areas 12 \nThe area of land potentially available for plant colonisation was taken from the ungeneralized 13 \nlayer of the Antarctic Digital Database (ADD Consortium, 2000), a topographic database that 14 \nincludes the area of sea, ice, rock, lake, shelf and moraine.  The rock areas were computed by 15 \nsumming the areas within boxes of one degree latitude and longitude and include all such 16 \nareas greater than 1000 m2.  There will be systematic errors of less than 1% in the total areas 17 \nrecorded caused by the map projection, and unknown errors deriving from incomplete data 18 \n(for example, rock outcrops that cover too small an area to be represented in the ADD).  19 \nOverall, however, we believe these errors to be small and their impact on diversity and 20 \nbiogeography patterns to be negligible. 21 \n 22 \nBiodiversity analyses 23 \nSpecies richness measures were calculated for defined geographical areas (Fig. 1) and 24 \nlatitude bands.  For the maritime Antarctic these areas were based on a subdivision of the 25 \nAntarctic Peninsula into northern and southern sections, with the southern section itself 26 \ndivided into east and west areas, separate consideration of Alexander Island and the nearby 27 \nmainland coast, and also of three major island groups (South Shetland Islands, South Orkney 28 \nIslands and South Sandwich Islands).  These areas were based essentially on the long-29 \nestablished climatic and biotic zones (Lewis Smith, 1984).  The Antarctic continent was 30 \ndivided arbitrarily into a series of well-established sectors (Greene et al., 1970), defined 31 \nsolely by longitude, the aim of which was to investigate possible spatial heterogeneity in 32 \nplant diversity and assemblage composition within the continent.  Abundance information 33 \nwas not used because of the non-quantitative nature of sampling at most locations.  Areas 34 \n  \n5\neither close to scientific stations or that are relatively easy to access have typically been 1 \nsampled more often and more comprehensively than remote or less accessible sites.  Many of 2 \nthe latter will have been visited only once, often by a non-specialist.  In addition to examining 3 \nrichness estimates at the species level, these were also calculated at higher taxonomic levels 4 \n(genus, family, order, class) to identify whether any patterns exhibited at the species level 5 \nwere also apparent for higher taxonomic levels.  To test whether any patterns in species 6 \nrichness and latitude were being caused by sampling bias we calculated two further estimates 7 \nof species richness, Chao2 and Jacknife1 (Magurran, 2004). These were chosen because they 8 \nshowed the least overall bias (Chao2) and greatest accuracy (Jacknife1) in a recent review of 9 \nspecies richness estimators (Walther & Moore, 2005).  Values were calculated using 10 \nEstimateS version 6.0b1 (Colwell, 2001) with a sample being defined as all specimens 11 \ncollected by an individual collector within one season. As information was required on the 12 \ncollector and date of collection only herbarium data were used for these analyses. 13 \n 14 \nBiogeographic patterns were examined using multivariate methods in PRIMER (Plymouth 15 \nRoutines in Multivariate Ecological Research version 5 and beta-test version 6, Primer-E Ltd, 16 \nPlymouth Marine Laboratory, UK; Clarke and Warwick, 2001).  Species records were 17 \nclassified into areas in two ways: firstly by latitude band, but separating Antarctic Peninsula 18 \nand non-Antarctic Peninsula records, and secondly into predefined areas (Fig.1).  As these 19 \nareas are of different sizes and sampling effort in each was very dissimilar, only 20 \npresence\/absence data were used in the analyses.  Similarities between the different areas 21 \nbased on species co-occurrences were calculated using the Bray-Curtis coefficient, and multi-22 \ndimensional scaling (MDS) ordinations then plotted. 23 \n 24 \nTo determine whether there were subtle patterns in taxonomic composition we calculated the 25 \ntaxonomic distinctness index of Clarke & Warwick (1998).  This index calculates the average 26 \ntaxonomic distance between randomly chosen pairs of species within the assemblage.  To 27 \ndetermine whether the value is significant or not, this value is compared with the mean value 28 \nfor assemblages of the same number of species but selected at random from the entire 29 \nAntarctic plant species list for that group (mosses or lichens).  These confidence intervals are 30 \nbroader for smaller richness values, giving the plots a characteristic funnel shape.  All known 31 \nAntarctic moss and lichen species were used as the master list and each sorted into a 32 \ntaxonomic hierarchy.  Mosses were classified into families, orders and classes using Buck & 33 \nGoffinet (2000), and lichens, similarly, using Eriksson et al. (2001).  Not all lichens could be 34 \n  \n6\nassigned to a family or order in this classification, and in such cases the species were 1 \nassigned a unique \u201cdummy\u201d value for the unknown taxon.  Liverworts and vascular species 2 \nwere excluded from some of the biodiversity analyses because there are very few Antarctic 3 \nspecies.  There are only two species of vascular plant, both of which occur on the western 4 \nside of the Antarctic Peninsula and other maritime Antarctic archipelagos (Lewis Smith, 5 \n2003).  The majority of the 25 liverwort species (Bednarek-Ochyra et al., 2000) are also 6 \nrestricted to this area with only eight species found at latitudes greater than 65\u00b0S on the 7 \nAntarctic Peninsula, and a single species found elsewhere in Antarctica. 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n 11 \nRESULTS 12 \n 13 \nHow well has the Antarctic flora been surveyed? 14 \n 15 \nThe traditional view of Antarctica, one of a largely unvisited wilderness almost unknown to 16 \nscience, is quite misleading.  Whilst collection of plants has been sporadic and some of the 17 \nmore remote areas have received single or very few repeat visits (and none by specialists), 18 \nAntarctica is far better known biologically than is often realised.  Nevertheless, the question 19 \nof sampling effects and bias on studies of biogeography and biological diversity is a very real 20 \none.  To assess the extent of sampling for macroflora, we compared areas that have the 21 \npotential for plant colonisation (i.e. areas of ground free from permanent ice) with areas from 22 \nwhich plants have been recorded.  Figure 2 collates one degree boxes which contain areas of 23 \nice-free land.  In all, 914 boxes include some ice-free ground, and plants have been collected 24 \nin 276 (30%) of these.  This analysis, however, may underestimate the total percentage of ice-25 \nfree ground from which plants have been sampled, as the total area of ice-free ground in 26 \nboxes without plant records is 2.2828 x 104 km2, whereas the total area of ice-free ground in 27 \nboxes with plant records is 2.2727 x 104 km2 (49.9%).  It is not known how many boxes have 28 \nbeen visited with no plant life being observed, so it is impossible to distinguish between those 29 \nthat have not been visited from those in which no plants have been recorded. 30 \n 31 \nTo assess geographic variations in sampling effort, records were pooled by geographic area 32 \n(Table 1).  This reveals that, as would be expected, some areas have been very well studied, 33 \nwhile other areas have received much less attention.  In particular the South Shetland Islands, 34 \n  \n7\nwhere there are 10 permanent scientific stations and many more summer-only operations and 1 \nrefuges, has been particularly well studied.  There are, however, at least 1800 records 2 \n(including both herbarium and literature records) from all areas except the Maud and Byrd 3 \nSectors of the continent. Byrd sector contains no permanent research stations and has been 4 \nlittle explored biologically other than during the American expeditions to Marie Byrd Land in 5 \n1934 (Siple, 1938) and 1940-41, and a few collections made by geological and glaciological 6 \nparties working on Thurston Island and the Eights Coast.  There are a number of coastal 7 \nstations in Maud Sector, but much of the ice-free ground here is at high altitude and difficult 8 \nto access.  However, plant collections have been made in Dronning Maud Land and at the 9 \nSchirmacher Oasis (e.g. Engelskj\u00f8n, 1986b; Richter, 1995) and the small number of records 10 \nis probably a true reflection of the paucity of plant life in these areas. 11 \n 12 \nIt is a well-established feature of biodiversity studies that the observed taxonomic richness of 13 \na region is a strong function of the sampling intensity, as described in broad terms above for 14 \nAntarctica.  The quality and thoroughness of sampling, and of the subsequent taxonomic 15 \nwork, is also important, but this cannot always be assessed from literature records.  The 16 \nherbarium records in the Antarctic Plant Database have, however, been verified thoroughly.  17 \nWe therefore tested the potential impact of sampling heterogeneity for Antarctica as a whole 18 \nby determining the relationship between the number of specimens collected and the number 19 \nof species recorded for all one degree lat\/long boxes.  As would be expected there was a 20 \nstrong positive correlation between the number of specimens collected from a given box and 21 \nthe plant species richness recorded for that box (Fig. 3a).  As these boxes are of different 22 \nphysical area depending on latitude, and contain differing amounts of ice-free ground, we 23 \nalso investigated the relationship between ice-free area and the number of species within each 24 \nbox (Fig. 3b & 3c).  These analyses illustrated that within continental Antarctica (here 25 \ndefined as all latitudes with longitudes clockwise between 47\u00b0W and 80\u00b0W plus all localities 26 \nfurther south than 75\u00b0S) there was no discernable relationship between the area of ice-free 27 \nground within a box and the number of species recorded from that box (Fig. 3c). 28 \n 29 \nWithin the Antarctic Peninsula, boxes containing large areas of ice-free ground show great 30 \nvariation in the number of species that have been recorded from them. However, large 31 \nnumbers of species have not been recorded from boxes containing smaller areas of ice-free 32 \nground, giving an indication that the area of ice-free ground may set an upper bound to the 33 \nrichness of plant assemblages in that box (Fig. 3b).  The regression line of this upper bound 34 \n  \n8\nwas calculated using the method of Blackburn et al. (1992) and splitting the data into eight 1 \nequal sized bins. It was found to be: 2 \n 3 \nlog10 S = 0.782(log10A) + 0.663 (R2 = 78.3%), 4 \n 5 \nwhere S = number of species and A = area.  The slope of this upper bound relationship could 6 \nbe taken as an estimate of the scaling coefficient (traditionally designated z) of a species-area 7 \nrelationship for Antarctic plants (Brown, 1995).  The raw data represent independent areas 8 \nand hence are closer to an individual island plot than a series of nested samples, but the 9 \nestimate, z=0.78, is higher than reported typically for floras at a scale below that of 10 \nbiogeographic provinces (Rosenzweig, 1995). 11 \n 12 \nDiversity Patterns 13 \n 14 \na.  latitudinal gradients 15 \n 16 \nThere are two areas within the Antarctic where geographical continuity may permit the 17 \nexistence of latitudinal and, implicitly at least, environmental gradients.  These are the 18 \nAntarctic Peninsula and linked archipelagos (60\u00b0S-77\u00b0S), and in the Ross Sector of the 19 \ncontinent, from Cape Hallett southwards along the Victoria Land coast and then south 20 \nthrough the Transantarctic Mountains (69\u00b0S-86\u00b0S).  The Prince Charles Mountains (Enderby 21 \nSector) might allow a similar test but they extend over a smaller range of latitude (69\u00b0S to an 22 \nisolated peak at 76\u00b0S) and have yet to be systematically surveyed by botanists.  To identify 23 \nany influence of these gradients on diversity, plots were made of the number of species 24 \nrecorded at each degree of latitude within each (Fig. 4).  These suggest that a diversity 25 \ngradient exists along the Antarctic Peninsula but no such gradient is apparent through 26 \nVictoria Land and the Transantarctic Mountains.  The diversity gradient along the Antarctic 27 \nPeninsula is clearest for lichens, with a strong cline in species richness from 62\u00b0S to around 28 \n70oS.  However, for mosses, although there is a general southwards decline in species 29 \nnumber, this decline is not even, and richness remains broadly constant between 63 and 65\u00b0S 30 \nand again between 69 and 71\u00b0S.   31 \n 32 \nThe nature of the gradient along the Antarctic Peninsula was investigated further by plotting 33 \nthe percentage of species whose most northerly record occurs within each latitude box (Fig. 34 \n  \n9\n5).  This shows that the majority of species recorded from along the Antarctic Peninsula have 1 \ntheir most northerly record between 60 and 62\u00b0S, and very few species have been collected 2 \nsolely at more southerly latitudes.  This indicates that the diversity cline is driven by 3 \nincreasing numbers of species being lost from the assemblage with increasing latitude, rather 4 \nthan taxonomically different assemblages being found at different latitudes.  In other words, 5 \nthe diversity gradient is driven almost completely by decreasing local (alpha) diversity with 6 \nincreasing latitude, and the contribution of turnover (beta) diversity is small.  To investigate 7 \nwhether the gradient was caused by the loss of individual species or by the loss of whole 8 \ngroups of species at higher taxonomic levels, the numbers of species, genera, families and 9 \norders at each latitude band were quantified (Fig. 6 a,b).  This shows that, while a taxonomic 10 \ndiversity gradient is evident for genera, at higher taxonomic levels it becomes less obvious, 11 \nparticularly at latitudes beyond 70\u00b0S, and suggests that the gradient is principally caused by 12 \nloss of species and genera rather than higher groups (families, orders or classes) with 13 \nincreasing latitude. 14 \n 15 \nTo test whether these clines in observed richness were driven by a decline in sampling 16 \nintensity towards higher latitudes, we calculated two univariate estimates of species richness 17 \nthat are least biased by sampling error, Chao2, or the most accurate, Jacknife1 (Walther & 18 \nMoore, 2005).  These measures are plotted alongside observed species richness (Fig 6 c,d), 19 \nand suggest strongly that the observed cline is real.  An alternative procedure to correct for 20 \nvariation in sampling intensity is to use the residual about the regression line fitted to the 21 \nrelationship between observed richness and sample number (Fig. 3a).  A positive residual 22 \nindicates a grid box with a relatively large species richness given the number of samples in 23 \nthat box, and a negative residual, a correspondingly low, species richness (Clarke & Lidgard 24 \n2000).  For the Antarctic plant data (Fig. 3a) a quadratic regression was a better fit than a 25 \nlinear model, and for the Antarctic Peninsula the residuals showed a statistically significant 26 \ninverse relationship with latitude (P<0.009).  We conclude that the cline in observed richness 27 \nalong the Antarctic Peninsula is real, being robust to a range of methods to correct for the 28 \neffects of sample bias. 29 \n 30 \nb. patterns in biodiversity 31 \n 32 \nThe MDS ordinations using the predefined areas (Fig. 1) show that the patterns found for 33 \nmosses and lichens are somewhat different (Fig. 7a & 7b).  The lichen pattern shows 3 34 \n  \n10\ndistinct clusters \u2013 (i) the South Orkney and South Shetland Islands and the northern and 1 \nwestern Antarctic Peninsula; (ii) the eastern and southern sections of the Antarctic Peninsula; 2 \nand (iii) Eastern Antarctica. The Scotia sector (not including the Antarctic Peninsula) and the 3 \nSouth Sandwich Islands are outliers. Cluster analysis confirmed that these groups were 4 \nsignificantly different from one another (p< 0.05).  The MDS ordination for mosses is more 5 \ndiffuse, but the plot for the Antarctic Peninsula areas matches well with the geographic 6 \npositions of these areas, although the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula is shown to be 7 \ndistinctly different from the western side.  The South Sandwich Islands are once again very 8 \ndifferent from all other localities and Byrd Sector is distinctly different from the other sectors 9 \nin continental Antarctica.  As the geographic areas used in this analysis were, of course, 10 \nchosen a priori, we therefore chose also to look at the Antarctic Peninsula in more detail 11 \nusing latitude bands rather than areas (Fig. 7c & 7d).  In these analyses the patterns for 12 \nmosses and lichens are more similar, with the MDS ordination in both groups broadly 13 \nmirroring the latitudinal gradient.  In both groups, however, there is a suggestion of a division 14 \ninto low latitude (60\u00b0S to about 71\u00b0S) and high latitude, continental, groups (above 71\u00b0S or 15 \n72\u00b0S).  This analysis thus supports the traditional division of the Antarctic terrestrial flora 16 \ninto Antarctic Peninsula (with associated island groups) and continental assemblages.  The 17 \nMDS ordination also suggests a finer scale differentiation of the floras of the Antarctic 18 \nPeninsula, and this is discussed in more detail below. 19 \n 20 \nc. Taxonomic diversity 21 \n 22 \nThe biogeographic patterns shown in Fig. 6a,b suggest that the assemblage composition of 23 \nthe Antarctic Peninsula flora in terms of higher taxa (families, orders and classes) is fairly 24 \nindependent of latitude.  The taxonomic distinctness values within different Antarctic regions 25 \nare shown in Fig. 8. There is no evidence for any trends in taxonomic distinctness values with 26 \nincreasing latitudes along the Antarctic Peninsula, supporting the results shown in Fig. 6a,b.  27 \nThe plot for mosses (Fig. 8a) shows that at many of the Antarctic Peninsula latitudes the 28 \nassemblages have distinctness values that are larger than expected  (that is they lie above the 29 \nupper 95% confidence interval), whereas roughly half the latitude bins for Eastern Antarctica 30 \nhave significantly low distinctness values.  This indicates that, for most of Antarctica, the 31 \nmoss flora is not simply a random assortment of the total regional species pool.  Species from 32 \na wide variety of higher taxa are found in the Antarctic Peninsula region whereas in 33 \ncontinental Antarctica there is a restricted species pool representing very few of the higher 34 \n  \n11\ntaxa.   The pattern for lichens is quite different (Fig. 8b).  Here, assemblages from the 1 \nAntarctic Peninsula all fall within the 95% confidence intervals, whereas the continental 2 \nsample still has many latitudinal bins with significantly low distinctness values.  Current 3 \nuncertainties in the higher classification of lichens, however, make it difficult to interpret 4 \nthese results with confidence.     5 \n 6 \n 7 \nDISCUSSION 8 \n 9 \nPrior to discussing any of the patterns in the diversity and biogeography of the Antarctic flora 10 \nit is essential to be reasonably confident that enough sampling has occurred, in sufficient 11 \nlocalities, to ensure that any patterns proposed are a result of species\u2019 distributions and not 12 \ndetermined solely by patterns in collecting.  It can be seen from Fig. 2 and Table 1 that 13 \nspecies have been recorded from a wide variety of Antarctic locations and that there are no 14 \nmajor regions from which no plants have been recorded. Specimens have been collected from 15 \nall latitudes between 60\u00b0S and 86\u00b0S, and at a good range of circumpolar localities.  There are, 16 \nhowever, smaller regions that warrant further botanical investigation, including the Byrd 17 \nsector (100-140\u00b0W), the southern extremes of the Antarctic Peninsula, the Transantarctic 18 \nMountains in the Ross Sector (particularly at latitudes beyond 80\u00b0S) and some areas in the 19 \nMaud and Enderby sectors. 20 \n 21 \nAlthough it is undoubtedly true that, as with many areas of the world, continued work by 22 \nexperts will add new records or revise existing taxonomies, we believe that the broad patterns 23 \nwe detect are real.  Plant specimens have been collected by more than 500 individuals over a 24 \nperiod of more than 160 years, so it is unlikely that the collecting patterns of either particular 25 \nindividuals or research expeditions will have any significant effect on the overall 26 \nbiogeographical patterns.  There is nevertheless a strong relationship between number of 27 \nspecimens collected in a given one-degree box and the number of species recorded for that 28 \nbox (Fig. 3a).  This is to be expected as botanists will tend to concentrate their efforts in the 29 \nmost interesting and diverse habitats, and there are also strong indications that the recorded 30 \nplant species richness is highest in those areas easily reached from long-established research 31 \nstations.  This is partly because both plant assemblages and research stations need areas of 32 \nice-free ground, but it also reflects the well-known \u2018field station hot-spot\u2019 effect.  There is 33 \nalso the inevitable bias that the more isolated areas, requiring greater logistic support, will 34 \n  \n12\nhave been less visited by either botanists or casual collectors. In addition, genuine 1 \nbiogeographic variability will be introduced by differences in historical processes (for 2 \nexample the time for which bare ground has been exposed to colonisation following glacial 3 \nretreat or changes in relative sea level). 4 \n 5 \nThe area of ice-free ground was not found to be a strong determinant of the number of 6 \nspecies found in different localities, at least when studied at the spatial scale of 1 degree 7 \nboxes of latitude and longitude (Fig. 3b, c).  This is not surprising as many of the larger ice-8 \nfree areas are in exposed, high altitude sites where plant life is restricted by the extreme 9 \ntemperatures and low water availability (particularly in continental Antarctica), or have only 10 \nrecently been exposed to colonisation by retreating ice or changes in sea level.  The richest 11 \nplant communities tend to be found at low altitudes in coastal regions, particularly where 12 \nthere is a diverse range of habitats.  Signy Island, in the South Orkney Islands, for example, 13 \nwhile a fairly small island (c. 25 km2) has a wide range of topographical and geological 14 \nvariations, which are snow-free for at least three months of the year, and a relatively high air 15 \ntemperature because of the ameliorating effects of the surrounding ocean (Lewis Smith, 16 \n1972).  It has the richest moss (at least 65 species) and lichen floras (220 species) in the 17 \nAntarctic (Ochyra, 1998, \u00d8vstedal and Lewis Smith, 2001), though it has also been a centre 18 \nof terrestrial ecological research since the early 1960s.  For the Antarctic Peninsula and 19 \nsurrounding islands, there is an indication that the area of ice-free ground may set an upper 20 \nbound on assemblage richness (Fig. 3b). Two factors could be at work here.  The first is that 21 \nlarger areas of ice-free ground are likely to support more diverse plant assemblages.  The 22 \nsecond is that a gradient in temperature along the Antarctic Peninsula means that more 23 \nnortherly boxes are likely to contain a higher percentage of ice-free ground, and this may 24 \ncombine with a cline in plant diversity along the peninsula to produce the pattern observed.  25 \nAs so often with ecology, it is difficult to separate these various influences. The upper bound 26 \nregression line, however, may be a useful predictor to estimate the limits to increases in 27 \nspecies richness in the Antarctic Peninsula where rapid regional climate change is causing ice 28 \nrecession and an increase in ice-free areas. 29 \n 30 \nBiogeographic areas within Antarctica 31 \n 32 \nMultivariate analyses using multi-dimensional scaling (Fig. 7) suggest that the traditional 33 \ndivision of the Antarctic terrestrial flora into maritime and continental regions may be too 34 \n  \n13\nsimplistic, and further subdivisions may be necessary to represent all phytogeographic zones.   1 \nLewis Smith (1984) divided the Antarctic into two geobotanical regions (Maritime and 2 \nContinental) and further subdivided these into two and three provinces respectively.  The 3 \nMaritime Antarctic was divided into northern and southern provinces, with the west coast of 4 \nthe Antarctic Peninsula to c. 66\u00b0S and associated islands (South Orkney, South Shetland and 5 \nSouth Sandwich Islands) in the northern province and the west coast of the Antarctic 6 \nPeninsula from c. 66\u00b0S and the north-east coast of the Peninsula to c. 63\u00b0S in the southern 7 \nprovince.  Continental Antarctica was divided into three zones: coastal, which included the 8 \neast coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and the coastal fringe of Eastern Antarctica and 9 \nWestern Antarctica south of 70\u00b0S; the slope zone, which included the mountain and glacier 10 \nzone inland from the coast; and the ice plateau zone, comprising of the central ice plateau on 11 \nthe interior of the continent.  Our MDS ordinations, however, suggest that some alterations of 12 \nthe definitions of the provinces are required if they are to represent justifiable 13 \nphytogeographical zones.  We suggest a division into two regions, with a finer-scale division 14 \ninto three provinces (Table 2).  The two regions, maritime and continental, are clearly 15 \nrevealed by the MDS ordination, with the boundary occurring at ~72\u00b0S.  However, more 16 \ndetailed work suggests a finer-scale division of the maritime region into two provinces, with 17 \nthe boundary lying between the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula at ~68\u00b0S and the 18 \neastern coast at ~65\u00b0S.  In an analogous consideration of Antarctic biodiversity patterns based 19 \nlargely on terrestrial fauna, Chown and Convey (in press) propose a biogeographical 20 \nboundary (the \u201cGressitt Line\u201d) with analogous strength to the Wallace Line of south-east 21 \nAsia, situated in a closely similar position to the maritime \u2013 continental boundary proposed 22 \nhere. 23 \n 24 \nThe South Sandwich Islands are generally included as part of the maritime Antarctic region, 25 \nwhereas our analyses indicate that the moss and lichen floras are distinctly different from 26 \nthose elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula.  The number of lichen species recorded from this 27 \narchipelago is very low (46 species, \u00d8vstedal and Lewis Smith, 2001) but most of the lichens 28 \nwhich have been collected there also occur elsewhere in the maritime Antarctic and, indeed, 29 \nmany are otherwise endemic to the Antarctic (Convey et al., 2000; \u00d8vstedal and Lewis 30 \nSmith, 2001).  Further studies in the region are needed to determine whether the lichen flora 31 \nis truly impoverished resulting from the fairly recent geological age of the islands (1-3 Myr, 32 \nHoldgate and Baker, 1979) and their extreme isolation or, rather, due to the paucity of 33 \nbotanical studies.  There have been only two comprehensive botanical studies of the islands 34 \n  \n14\nin 1964 (Longton & Holdgate, 1979) and 1997 (Convey et al., 2000).  The number of lichens 1 \nrecorded rose from 16 in the first study to c. 45 in the second, so further collecting in the 2 \nregion is likely to yield more species.  The moss flora is proportionally much richer (38 3 \nspecies), and unusual in that many of the mosses are found only, or predominantly, on heated 4 \nground around fumaroles (Convey et al., 2000).  A number of species not recorded elsewhere 5 \nin the Antarctic have been found here, whose presence is likely to be due to long distance 6 \ndispersal of these species from sub-Antarctic South Georgia and more distant continents, 7 \nespecially South America.  Other areas in the Antarctic where geothermally influenced soils 8 \nare present, such as Deception Island (Lewis Smith, 2005a,b), and Mts Melbourne and 9 \nErebus (Skotnicki et al., 2001) in Victoria Land, also have unusual bryofloras.  In such sites 10 \nthe increased temperatures and water availability allow the establishment of species which 11 \notherwise would not survive.  Further MDS ordinations, including the species found on South 12 \nGeorgia and other sub-Antarctic islands, are necessary to determine whether the South 13 \nSandwich Islands should be considered part of the northern Maritime Antarctic, the sub-14 \nAntarctic or as sufficiently distinctive to justify their own province.  15 \n 16 \nThe eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula is traditionally classified with continental 17 \nAntarctica, based mainly on its harsher climate compared with the western coast.  However, 18 \nMDS ordinations indicate that the eastern Antarctic Peninsula has more in common, in terms 19 \nof species composition of the flora, with the south-western Antarctic Peninsula than to any of 20 \nthe truly continental Antarctic regions.  We therefore suggest that the eastern Antarctic 21 \nPeninsula should form part of the southern Maritime region and that the boundary between 22 \nthe northern and southern provinces should be further south at 68\u00b0S, rather than 66\u00b0S as 23 \nsuggested by Bednarek-Ochyra et al. (2000).  Based on the MDS ordinations we have also 24 \nincluded the northeast Antarctic Peninsula to 65\u00b0S in the northern province rather than the 25 \nsouthern one (Table 2).   26 \n 27 \nWhile our analyses do confirm that most continental areas outside the Antarctic Peninsula 28 \nhave broadly similar floras, further botanical investigation is required in order to confirm 29 \nwhether the southern portion of the Scotia sector of continental Antarctica is more 30 \nappropriately linked northwards with the southern end of the Antarctic Peninsula or to the 31 \nother continental Antarctic regions.  Furthermore, whilst the lichen flora of the adjacent Byrd 32 \nsector is similar to the other continental sectors, the moss flora is more dissimilar.  Only ten 33 \nmoss species have been recorded from this region and two of these (collected from islands off 34 \n  \n15\nthe Eights Coast, 72\u00b0S 90-100\u00b0W) represent species otherwise found only in the maritime 1 \nAntarctic (Andreaea gainii Cardot and A. regularis M\u00fcll. Hal.).  Further exploration of the 2 \narea around the Eights Coast should help determine whether this region more accurately 3 \nshould be considered as the extreme southern extent of the maritime Antarctic. 4 \n 5 \n 6 \nLatitudinal gradients in plant diversity within Antarctica 7 \n 8 \nThere have been many cited examples of latitudinal gradients in taxonomic diversity 9 \n(reviewed by Gaston & Williams, 1996).  There have also been suggestions of latitudinal 10 \ngradients in the diversity of the Antarctic flora (e.g. Convey, 2001; Green & Broady, 2001; 11 \nClarke, 2003; Kappen, 2004), but the evidence cited usually combines diversity data from 12 \nsub-Antarctic islands with that from the Antarctic continent, which is a much wider area than 13 \nin our study.  In this study we have examined two regions within Antarctica sensu stricto 14 \nwhere habitat area runs meridionally, to determine whether there is evidence for the existence 15 \nof latitudinal gradients in diversity.  These analyses confirm that the Antarctic Peninsula 16 \nshows a decline in the number of lichen, moss and hepatic species with increasing latitude 17 \n(Fig. 4), a pattern which is robust to corrections for the effect of sample size (collection 18 \nintensity, Fig. 6 c,d).  Some intermediate latitudes also have particularly low numbers of 19 \nspecies, but these are likely to be a direct function of a lack of ice-free areas.  For instance, 20 \nthe only land areas at 61\u00b0S are the northernmost islands in the South Shetland Islands 21 \n(Elephant Island, Gibbs Island and Clarence Island), whose true diversity may also be 22 \nunderestimated as few collections have been made from these isolated islands.  Likewise, 23 \naround 66\u00b0S, other than a few offshore islands much of the coastline is steep and glaciated.  24 \nThere is much less evidence for a diversity gradient when examined at the level of family or 25 \nabove, at least at far south as 71\u00b0S, after which the number of higher taxa found drops off 26 \nrapidly (Fig. 6 a,b) 27 \n 28 \nThis finding is supported by analyses using taxonomic distinctness measures (Fig. 8 & 9).  29 \nThe data for mosses show that not only are there more moss species on the Antarctic 30 \nPeninsula than in other Antarctic regions but also that the Antarctic Peninsula is more diverse 31 \ntaxonomically.  However, there is no evidence for a cline in taxonomic distinctness (as 32 \nagainst species richness) along the Antarctic Peninsula.  The taxonomic distinctness values 33 \nfor lichen species show less differentiation between the Antarctic Peninsula and continental 34 \n  \n16\nlocalities, and no areas have significantly high values, while some areas in eastern Antarctica, 1 \nand at 64 and 65\u00b0S on the Antarctic Peninsula, have particularly low distinctness values.  2 \nAgain, however, there is no evidence of any significant variation in taxonomic distinctness 3 \nwith latitude.  The gradient in the number of species is therefore not caused because whole 4 \ngroups, such as families, are unable to survive at higher latitudes, but because individual 5 \nspecies have either not colonised that far south or have not adapted to the harsher climatic 6 \nconditions.  Further investigation is required to attempt to determine why some species are 7 \nfound at southerly locations but other closely related species are not.  Many factors may be 8 \nimportant such as growth form, availability of propagules and life history (Longton, 1988). 9 \n 10 \nThere is currently no evidence for a diversity gradient along the Victoria Land coast and into 11 \nthe Transantarctic Mountains (Fig. 4) although there have been very few collections made at 12 \nsome latitudes, and the number of species recorded may be heavily biased by collections 13 \nmade close to the Italian, American and New Zealand research stations in this region.  There 14 \nhave been no recent botanical surveys south of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, although there are 15 \nunpublished anecdotal reports from New Zealand workers of high lichen diversity (around 27 16 \nspecies) in the vicinity of Mt Kyffin (83\u00b0 45\u2019S) on the southern edge of the Beardmore 17 \nGlacier (Tuerk, R., SCAR Open Science Conference, Bremen, July 2004).  This observation 18 \ngreatly strengthens our preliminary finding of no marked cline in macrofloral diversity along 19 \nthe Transantarctic Mountains in Victoria Land.  The New Zealand Antarctic Programme is 20 \ncurrently leading the Latitudinal Gradient Project, which involves studying both physical and 21 \nbiological features, including the biodiversity of terrestrial organisms, at a number of sites 22 \nalong a gradient on the Victoria Land Coast from 72-86\u00b0S (Peterson and Howard-Williams, 23 \n2001).  The data collected from this project should help provide a more representative dataset 24 \nwith which to investigate the existence of any latitudinal gradients in Victoria Land to match 25 \nthat detected along the Antarctic Peninsula. 26 \n 27 \nHistorical aspects 28 \n 29 \nThe majority of Antarctic flora is generally thought to have originated fairly recently with 30 \nrecolonisation following the retreat of glaciers and ice-sheets from their Pleistocene maxima 31 \n(Hertel, 1987, Galloway 1991, Ochyra et al. 1998), predominantly through long-distance 32 \ndispersal with wind as an important vector (Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2004).  What is unclear, however, is 33 \nhow many species survived the Pleistocene glaciations on ice-free nunataks and oases. In the 34 \n  \n17\nmaritime Antarctic all low altitude, coastal regions are believed to have been obliterated by 1 \nmuch expanded glaciers and ice sheets during the last glacial maximum (LGM) (Larter and 2 \nVanneste, 1995; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2002; COHIMAR\/SEDANO Scientific Party, 2003; see 3 \nalso reviews placing these studies within a biological context by Convey, 2003, and Chown 4 \nand Convey, in press), and only re-exposed as ice has retreated over, at most, the last 10,000 5 \nyears.  While recent biogeographical studies do indicate that this view must be overly 6 \nsimplistic and inaccurate at small scales (Pugh and Convey, 2000; Maslen and Convey, in 7 \npress), it remains the case that no potential refugia can be proposed in coastal areas of this 8 \nregion based on current glaciological reconstructions.   9 \n 10 \nIn the coastal continental Antarctic, it is now clear, from palaeolimnological data that some 11 \ncoastal oases have hosted terrestrial or freshwater faunas for up to 150,000 years (Hodgson et 12 \nal., 2001; Squier et al., 2005), and hence that at least some terrestrial habitats have a 13 \nconsiderably longer continuous history of exposure extending well beyond the LGM.  14 \nHowever, these findings still fall a long way short of demonstrating persistence throughout 15 \nthe Pleistocene.  Elsewhere in the continental Antarctic, diverse studies of the glaciology and 16 \nlimnology of the Victoria Dry Valley region (Denton et al., 1993) and most recently the 17 \nmolecular biology of terrestrial arthropods (Nolan et al. in press; Stevens et al. in press; 18 \nStevens & Hogg, in press; Stevens & Hogg, 2003) support the existence of terrestrial and 19 \nfreshwater habitats throughout the Pleistocene and back to, at least, 1-2 million years ago if 20 \nnot the Miocene glaciations of 3-5 million years ago.    21 \n 22 \nThat a general historical explanation may not apply to the Antarctic macroflora as a whole is 23 \nindicated by the very different patterns of endemism in Antarctic mosses and lichens.  24 \n\u00d8vstedal & Lewis Smith (2001, 2004) report 130 endemic lichens from a total Antarctic flora 25 \nof 393 species (a level of endemism of 33% - 50% in continental Antarctica), whereas only 6-26 \n7% of mosses are currently believed to be endemic (Ochyra et al. 1998) and none of these are 27 \nendemic to continental Antarctica. Whilst these endemism figures are likely to be affected by 28 \nimproved studies of the Periantarctic islands, and detailed comparisons of Antarctic 29 \nspecimens with those from nearby southern hemisphere locations, they do suggest that, at a 30 \nhigh taxonomic level, the two dominant groups of plants have fundamentally different 31 \nevolutionary histories in Antarctica.  In particular, they suggest that the bryophytes are 32 \n(almost) entirely more recent colonists, while the lichens may include a component with a 33 \nmore ancient and vicariant distribution.  This lichen pattern is also noted in elements of the 34 \n  \n18\ninvertebrate fauna of some inland nunataks, including mites (Marshall & Pugh, 1996) and 1 \ntardigrades (Convey & McInnes, 2005).  The recent origin for much of the flora is supported 2 \nby species richness patterns with the highest number of species occurring in localities closest 3 \nto neighbouring continents and where there are more favourable climatic conditions for 4 \nestablishment.  It is certainly clear that Antarctica experiences a continuous, if low level, 5 \ninput of propagules from the other Southern Hemisphere continents (Marshall, 1996).  Any 6 \nindividual colonising propagule faces many obstacles during the dispersal and colonisation 7 \nprocesses, requiring long distance transfer, arrival in a suitable area of habitat at a suitable 8 \ntime of year, and acquiring the resources necessary for both initial survival and long term 9 \nestablishment (Clarke, 2003). However, it is also clear from many culture and environmental 10 \nmanipulation experiments that propagules can remain dormant and viable in propagule banks 11 \nin soil and (probably) ice for considerable periods (Lewis Smith 1993; During, 1997).  Such 12 \nabilities have important implications for future changes in diversity to be expected under 13 \ncurrent trends of climatic change in parts of Antarctica (Convey, 2003).  14 \n 15 \nIt is difficult, however, to draw conclusions about the evolutionary history of the Antarctic 16 \nflora solely from contemporary species distributions.  These questions require an approach 17 \ncombining a comprehensive knowledge of Antarctic plant species and their wider distribution 18 \nthroughout the world with studies into their genetic diversity and rates of evolution.  In 19 \nparticular modern molecular methods can provide powerful insights into previous population 20 \nfragmentation and bottlenecks, historical patterns of dispersal and gene flow, relatedness 21 \nbetween Antarctic taxa, and also with those elsewhere.  Such studies are at an early stage in 22 \nAntarctica, although already generating exciting results \u2013 for example, the only molecular 23 \nclock study published to date for any terrestrial organism in Antarctica (of the evolutionary 24 \nrelationships between endemic maritime and sub-Antarctic chironomid midges; Allegruci et 25 \nal., 2006) has proposed separation events on a similar timsescale (c. 40 million years) to that 26 \nof the different tectonic elements now occupied by these species (Livermore et al., 2005).  27 \nIntegration of all of these approaches will be critical in elucidating the biogeographic and 28 \nevolutionary history of the Antarctic macroflora. 29 \n 30 \nAcknowledgements 31 \nWe would like to thank Dana Bergstrom and Dave Watts for providing data on Antarctic 32 \nspecimens held in the Australian Antarctic Division Herbarium; Paul Cooper and Peter 33 \nFretwell, of the British Antarctic Survey, for providing data on areas of ice-free land and 34 \n  \n19\nassistance with the maps.
