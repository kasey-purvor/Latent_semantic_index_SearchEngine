We assessed perceptions \nand behaviours in six domains (ethical; investment; gambling; health and safety; \nrecreational; social) using the DOSPERT (Weber, Blais & Betz, 2002) and measured \npersonality using the NEO PI-R (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Results from structural \nequation modelling showed that personality had a direct effect on risky choice \nbehaviour in four domains (social, ethical, gambling and recreational risk taking). In \naddition, perceived costs and benefits mediated the relations between personality and \nrisk taking in the five domains (social, ethical, gambling, recreational and investment \nrisk taking).  Evidence for a mechanism that integrates both direct and indirect effects of \npersonality on behaviour is discussed. \n2 \n \nIntroduction \nThe purpose of this article is to contribute towards current theory and research \non the mechanisms by which personality and risk-related choice behaviour are linked.  \nWe report on a study of the associations between personality, the perceived costs and \nbenefits of 39 risky choices in six domains, and the perceived likelihood of taking each \nof these choices.  A substantial body of research indicates that the tendency to take risk \nis associated with personality (e.g. Carducci & Wong, 1998; Lauriola & Levin, 2001; \nNicholson, Soane, Fenton-O'Creevy, & Willman, 2005; Olson & Suls, 2000; \nZuckerman, 1979; Zuckerman, Ball, & Black, 1990).  In comparison, the  mechanisms \nunderlying the relationship between personality and risk taking are not well researched \n(Katz, Fromme, & D'Amico, 2000).  \nWe begin by briefly reviewing the literature on the relationship between \npersonality and risk-related choice, and then consider how personality and risk-related \nchoice might be linked through perceptions of costs and benefits. \n \nPersonality and Risk Behaviour \nEarly studies examining the relations between dispositions and risk taking \nfocused primarily on sensation seeking (Zuckerman, 1979), and significant relationships \nhave been found between sensation seeking and risk taking in relation to dangerous \nsports (Zuckerman, 1983), making decisions about driving speed (Goldenbeld & van \nSchagen, 2007), smoking heavily (Zuckerman et al., 1990), volunteering for combat \nunits in the army (Hobfoll, Rom, & Segal, 1989) and making risky financial \ninvestments in simulations (Harlow & Brown, 1990). \n3 \n \nLater studies indicate that risky decision-making is also associated with a \nbroader range of personality traits.  Carducci and Wong (1998) examined the influence \nof Type A personality on financial risk taking in everyday money matters (e.g., personal \ninvestments and household affairs) and found that subjects who were classified as Type \nA took greater financial risks than Type B subjects.  In a longitudinal study of health-\nrisk behaviours using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ, Tellegen, \n1982), Caspi et al. (1997) found that specific patterns of MPQ dimensions identified in \nan individual at childhood and youth were linked to different health-risk behaviours \ndemonstrated by this individual at adulthood. Wulfert et al. (1999) found that \ndispositional factors related to personality, such as impulsivity and deception, were \nassociated with unsafe sexual behaviour among HIV positive individuals. Individuals \nwho rate themselves as more self-disciplined, responsible, reliable, and dependable than \nothers, characteristics which are associated with personality (Costa & McCrae, 1992), \nare less likely to be involved in driving accidents than those who rate themselves lower \non these attributes (Arthur & Graziano, 1996). \nMore recently, research on the relationship between personality and risk \nbehaviour has used the five-factor model of personality (Digman, 1990) as measured by \nthe NEO-PIR (Costa & McCrae, 1992).  Olson and Suls (2000) examined the \nrelationship between the Big Five personality dimensions and individual risk \njudgements.  When presented with risky dilemmas, respondents made more extreme, \nrisky judgments if they were relatively high in openness and agreeableness, and low in \nemotional stability.  Another study of the relationships between the Big Five and risk \ntaking (Nicholson et al., 2005), this time in the recreational, health, financial, career, \nsafety, and social risk taking domains, found that self-ratings of the frequency of risk \n4 \n \ntaking were associated with high extraversion and openness; and with low neuroticism, \nagreeableness, and conscientiousness.  \n \nExplanations for the Relationship Between Personality and Risky Decision  Making \nDespite the reliable associations between personality dimensions and risk-\ntaking behaviour outlined in the research set out above, the mechanism (or \nmechanisms) by which personality is linked to risk-taking is not fully understood \n(Katz et al., 2000).  Only a small number of studies have indeed examined the \nrelationships between expected outcomes, personality, and risk taking behaviours.  \nKatz et al. (2000) examined both personality traits and outcome expectancies as \nexplanations for heavy drinking, drug use, and unsafe sexual behavior among 162 \ncollege students. Results indicated that while personality and past experience were \nassociated with outcome expectancies (i.e. the benefits and costs of engaging in a \nparticular behavior), outcome expectancies and personality also independently predict \nthe likelihood of risk taking behaviour.  In a study of young adults, Cohen and \nFromme (2002) examined associations between personality traits (social conformity \nand sensation seeking), self-efficacy, high risk sexual activity, and substance abuse.  \nThey found that sensation seeking and social conformity were related to substance use \nand sexual behaviour indirectly through outcome expectancies, and that social \nconformity was also associated directly with these risky behaviors.   \nThe studies by Katz et al. (2000) and Cohen and Fromme (2002) described \nabove are concerned with a narrow range of personality variables and focus on the \nprediction of a narrow band of behaviours.  The present study extends existing \nresearch on the direct and indirect influence of personality on risk taking in two ways.    \n5 \n \nFirst,  the range of personality traits investigated is extended  to include the Big Five \ntraits (Digman, 1989, 1990).  Second, in order to examine whether the indirect and \ndirect model of the influence of personality on risky decision making can be \ngeneralized beyond the specific settings in which this has been studied previously (e.g. \nsexual behaviour and substance use), it is examined here in a much broader range of \ncontexts: ethical, recreational, investment, health and safety, gambling, and social.   \n In this study we predicted that Big Five personality traits will be associated \nwith risk taking both directly and indirectly via payoffs (i.e. perceived costs and \nbenefits). We examine three possible explanations for the link between personality and \nrisk taking. The first possibility is that personality is associated with risk taking \nbehaviour indirectly via an influence on \u201cpayoff weightings\u201d.  Payoff weightings, akin \nto outcomes expectancies, are the perceived benefits and costs (risk) associated with \nchoice to engage in a particular behaviour. The second possibility is that personality is \nassociated with behaviour directly.  The third possible explanation is an integrated \nmodel whereby personality influences risk taking behaviour both directly and \nindirectly and the specific pathway for a decision is influenced by the context, or \ndecision domain. These models of the relations between personality, perceived costs \nand benefits, and risk taking behaviour are set out in Figure 1.  \n____________________ \nInsert Figure 1 about here \n___________________ \n \n6 \n \nIn the study set out below we developed and tested the above model and \nexamine the relations between a broad range of personality traits and risk related \nchoice in a range of different situational domains. We used two well validated \nmeasures: the NEO PI-R to measure personality (Costa & McCrae, 1992), and the \nDOSPERT (Weber, Blais & Betz, 2002) to measure outcome expectancies (costs and \nbenefits), and risk related choice in six distinct domains (ethical, recreational, \ninvestment, gambling, health and safety, and social). A multi-domain measure of risk \nenabled an examination of the extent and nature of the associations between \npersonality and behaviour. \nThe primary hypotheses tested here are that (a) perceived costs and benefits \nwill mediate the relation between personality and risk taking in each domain and (b) \npersonality will also be directly associated with the likelihood of risk taking in each \ndomain.  \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nThe participants were 204 UK postgraduate students drawn from management \nprogrammes. The sample comprised 67.2% women and 32.8% men. The mean age was \n26.70 years (range = 21-48, standard deviation = 6.12 years).   \nMeasures \nThe likelihood of taking a variety of risky decisions, and the perceived costs and \nbenefits of  these decisions, were examined with a set of items and scales developed by \nWeber, Blais and Betz (2002). This measure, popularly referred to as the DOSPERT, \n7 \n \ncomprises 40 items (risky decisions), divided into six domains (ethical, investment, \ngambling, health and safety, recreational, and social).  Participants are required to \nexamine the risky decisions three times, once to indicate the likelihood that they would \nengage in each behaviour, once to indicate the strength of the perceived benefits of each \nbehaviour, and once to indicate the perceived cost (risk) of each behaviour (all three \nbeing measured on five-point Likert scales).  One amendment was made to the \nDOSPERT, an item referring to tornado chasing was omitted as this was judged not to \nbe relevant to the UK sample.  For each of the six domains, mean scores were calculated \nfor each participant for (a) the likelihood of risk taking, (b) the perceived benefits of risk \ntaking, and (c) the perceived costs of risk taking. \nPersonality was assessed using the NEO PI-R (Costa & McCrae, 1992), a \ncomprehensive measure of six facets of personality in each of five factors. In this study \nwe used factor level data obtained by summing the 30 constituent items. The five \nfactors are as follows: \n1. Neuroticism: the degree to which people are prone to experience anxiety, anger, \nimpulsive decision making, pessimism and stress. \n2. Extraversion: the degree to which people are outgoing, sociable, assertive, enjoy \na fast pace of life, sensation-seeking and experience positive emotions. \n3. Openness: preferences for abstract, theoretical thinking, interest in own and \nothers\u2019 feelings, aesthetics, and conservative versus relative values \n4. Agreeableness: the extent to which people are frank, straightforward, trusting, \nmodest about their achievements, co-operative, altruistic and tender minded. \n5. Conscientiousness: the degree to which people are organised, prepared, conform \nto rules, achievement striving, goal focused and deliberative.  \n8 \n \n Results \n \nCorrelational Analyses \nCorrelations between the measured variables in the social, ethical, investment, \nand recreational domains are shown in Table 1.   \n \n____________________ \nInsert Table 1 about here \n____________________ \n \nThe correlation coefficients indicate that the risky choice is typically associated \nwith low perceived cost (risk) and high perceived benefits.  The associations between \nrisky choice, perceived costs and perceived benefits are stronger between domains than \nacross domains. The correlations between personality, perceived costs and benefits and \nrisk related choice behaviour (likelihood), and the means and standard deviations of the \nrisk scale variables, are shown in Table 2. \n \n____________________ \nInsert Table 2 about here \n____________________ \n \nThere were eleven significant associations between personality and the \nlikelihood of taking risks, eight significant associations between perceived benefits and \n9 \n \nrisk taking, and four associations between perceived costs and risk taking. These \nfindings suggest personality is associated with choice, and that the associations between \npersonality and perceived benefits are stronger than the associations with perceived \ncosts in some cases. The correlations between personality, outcome expectancies and \nchoice are strongest in the ethical domain.  \nThe overall personality configuration associated with risky choice was low \nscores in neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness, and high scores in \nextraversion and openness. These data fit with previous research (Heaven, 1996; \nLounsbury, Steel, Loveland, & Gibson, 2004; Salgado, 2000; Wilkinson & Abraham, \n2004). However, there are some exceptions. Notably, high neuroticism was associated \nwith gambling behaviour, and high perceived risk for health and safety, recreational and \nsocial domains. This is similar to Nicholson et al\u2019s (2005) finding that neuroticism was \nassociated with drinking and smoking.  \n \nStructural Equation Modelling \nFor each domain structural equation modelling using EQS was carried out to \ninvestigate the direct associations between the Big Five personality traits and the \nlikelihood of risk taking, and the indirect associations between the Big Five personality \ntraits and the likelihood of risk taking (via costs and benefits).  The initial model for \neach domain allowed all five personality traits to predict costs, benefits, and the \nlikelihood of risk taking, and for costs and for benefits to predict the likelihood of risk \ntaking.  In all cases, the Big Five personality traits were allowed to co-vary as there is \nsome evidence which indicates that these dimensions are not independent (Costa & \nMcCrae, 1992).  \n10 \n \nTo evaluate the goodness of fit of the six measurement models, the Standardized \nRoot Mean Square Residual (SRMS; (Steiger & Lind, 1980)), Root Mean Square Error \nof Approximation (RMSEA; (Steiger & Lind, 1980)), and Comparative Fit Index \n(Bentler, 1990) were selected.  For the SRMR, values of up to .09 indicate good fit (Hu \n& Bentler, 1999); for RMSEA values of less than .05 indicate good fit and values up to \n.08 suggest a satisfactory fit (Browne & Cudeck, 1993). For the CFI, values indicating \ngood fit are at least .95 (Hu & Bentler, 1999). \nEach domain-specific model was tested in turn by first examining the three fit \nindices.   In all cases the initial model was poorly fitted to the data, and from this point \nan exploratory approach was adopted in order to ascertain the best fitting models.  Table \n3 shows the fit indices for the models which were found to have the best fit in each \ndomain for five of the six domains. It was not possible to identify a well-fitting model \nfor the other domain, health and safety, probably due to the very pronounced positive \nskew for perceived benefits.  The model for the gambling domain is satisfactory, and \nthe fit for the other four models is very good.   \n____________________ \nInsert Table 3 about here \n____________________ \n \nFigures 2 to 6 how the best fitting models in each of the five domains. In four of \nthe five domains (i.e. social, ethical, recreational and gambling) the expected \ncombination of direct associations between personality and the likelihood of risk taking, \nand the indirect relations between personality and risk taking (via cost and benefits) \nwere confirmed.  In the remaining domain, investment, the likelihood of risk taking was \n11 \n \nstrongly associated with the perceived benefits of doing so, and the only personality \ntrait significantly associated with these benefits is agreeableness (negatively).   \n \n____________________ \nInsert Figures 2 to 6 about here \n____________________ \n  \nDiscussion \nIn this study we found that personality has an impact on choice behaviour both \ndirectly and via perceived costs and benefits.  This finding is consistent with the \nargument that a more integrated model of risky choice behaviour is required when \nexamining the association of personality with individual risk related choices (Cohen & \nFromme, 2002; Katz et al., 2000). The variation across decision domains found in this \nstudy strengthens this argument as it indicates that contextual factors influence the \nrelations between personality, costs, benefits, and risk-related choices as the pathways \nbetween the factors vary in each domain. In some situational domains there are direct \nassociations between personality variables but this is not the case in all situational \ndomains. In the discussion that follows we discuss evidence for the possible \nmechanisms through which personality influences choice behaviour. \n  First, we consider the evidence for the direct associations between personality \nand choice behaviour. In the ethical domain, associations with agreeableness and \nconscientiousness found in research on integrity testing (Marcus et al., 2006) were \nreplicated. Consistent with the direct association model, in the social and ethical \ndomains, there were significant direct paths between personality and risky decision-\n12 \n \nmaking (agreeableness and openness in the case of social choice behaviour, and \nagreeableness and conscientiousness for ethical choice behaviour).   \nIn addition, consistent with the mediated model, costs and benefits mediated the \nrelations between personality and risk taking in the social and ethical domains \n(neuroticism, agreeableness and openness for social risk taking, and neuroticism for \nethical risk taking).  Here, neuroticism was associated with high perceived benefits and \nrisky choice which fits with previous research in these domains. Lauriola and Levin \n(2001) also refer to the importance of the domain and risk taking in the case of \nneuroticism. For example, in their research, Lauriola and Levin (2001) found that \npeople were risk seeking if they perceived possible increases in losses from status quo. \nThey suggested that people with high scores in neuroticism, when faced with possible \nlosses, see the benefits of taking risks in order to avoid these losses. Nicholson et al \n(2005) suggested that the positive association between neuroticism and health risk \ntaking was due to choices to drink alcohol and smoke being perceived as beneficial due \nto their short term positive impact on anxiety. In this study, it is also possible that \nparticipants with high scores in neuroticism saw the benefits of risky social behaviour, \n(e.g. plagiarising an essay), as being more useful than potential costs (e.g. failing the \npaper). Participants high in agreeableness perceived low costs, and were likely to make \na risky choice in the social domain. This finding seems likely to reflect the items in the \nDOSPERT (Weber, Blais & Betz, 2002) which are concerned with conformity and co-\noperation (e.g. agreeing with friends, not asking your boss for a raise) rather than going \nagainst social norms that might be more typically associated with risk taking and low \nagreeableness.  \n13 \n \nIn general, personality, perceived benefits, and perceived costs accounted for a \nsubstantial amount of variance in risk related choice.  Specifically, in the ethical and \nsocial domains, the models shown in figures 2 and 3 accounted for 42% and 55% of the \nvariance respectively.  In the recreational and investment domains, where only \nperceived benefits had a significant relationship with risk related choice, the percentage \nof variance in risky decision-making accounted for was 53% and 48% respectively.  \nThese findings suggest that risk related choice can be partially predicted by a \ncombination of personality, perceived benefits and costs, and in some cases by \nperceived costs and benefits alone, providing some support for the integrated model of \nchoice behaviour. \nWhile perceived benefits are likely to be important to understanding choice \nbehaviour, a significant finding in our study is that personality traits can predict risk \nrelated choice behaviour in certain domains independently of cost-benefit evaluations. \nTo understand this process it is useful to draw on the literature on automaticity.  The \nnotion of automaticity suggests that many decision processes operate at a subconscious \nlevel using algorithms and heuristics (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999).  Research supports the \nnotion of subconscious rule building and rule following (Van Osselaer, Ramanathan, \nCampbell, Cohen, Dale, Herr, Janiszewski, Kruglanski, Lee, Read, Russo, & Tavassoli, \n2005) which can be based upon habits developed over time (Kim, Malhotra, & \nNarasimhan, 2005).   \nThe concept of automaticity could be helpful in explaining direct relations \nbetween personality and behaviour and this may be particularly true in ethical and social \ndomains of behaviour where people with certain personality traits may develop some \nautomatic rules of behaviour that are consistently applied in certain situational domains.  \n14 \n \nFor example, it is relatively easy for a conscientious person to quickly develop a rule \nthat high levels of preparation make work more efficient. Work situations involving \npreparation, which is particularly relevant to conscientiousness traits, could lead to a \nrule being developed and, when faced with a decision about whether to prepare for a \nmeeting or not, the conscientious individual may carry out the work without \nundertaking a cost-benefit analysis.  Moreover, the conscientious person in this situation \nis likely to attend to the rewards of their preparedness, reinforcing learning that is trait \nrelevant.  This kind of rule following can be likened to a heuristic driven by personality. \nPersonality factors could have an important role to play in automaticity and decision \nmaking (Banse & Greenwald, 2007), both of which may play a critical role in \npersonality-behaviour associations.   \nThe current study has provided interesting information that can be used to \ndevelop understanding of the processes through which personality might influence \ndecision making behaviour. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages to \nour approach. A more naturalistic measure of decision making that provided more \ncontextual information about the nature of the risks under investigation would assist \nboth decision makers who would be able to make choices more closely associated with \ntheir actual behaviour. In addition, there are also choice behaviours that are likely to be \nalmost entirely situationally driven and further consideration of context could add to \nunderstanding of when situational context is more significant in shaping choice \nbehaviour than personality. \n This study suggests that there are several avenues for useful future research.  \nFirst, studies could assess personality and trait relevance for the same group of \nparticipants. This would enable assessment of the extent to which ratings of trait \n15 \n \nrelevance are more closely associated with individual traits or situational characteristics. \nSecond, the nature of the risks examined could be examined in terms of potential trait \nrelevance rather than simply by domain. The more naturalistic and detailed approach \ndescribed above would help to achieve this. Third, more in-depth data regarding costs \nand benefits could be collected, for example the perceived magnitude and likelihood of \nrisks have a role to play in cost-benefit analysis. Analyses of these data would enable a \nclearer sequential model of the processes through which personality influences decision \nbehaviour to be developed. Finally, there could be further research that extends the \ncurrent study by considering the role of affect in the perceptions of benefits and costs \nand choice behaviour. Studies by Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic and Johnson (2000), and \nFinucane and Holup (2006), have shown that affect can be used as a heuristic and \ncombined with perceptions to create risk values. The combination of factors could \ndevelop further our understanding of the mechanisms through which personality \ninfluences behaviour. \n \nReferences \nArthur, W., & Graziano, W. G. (1996).
