Social influence by fait-\naccompli needs to be within the remit of social psychology, otherwise it \nlooses its relevance in a technological society where artefacts mediate most \ninter-personal relations.    \n \n \n\u201cFait accompli: an action which is completed (and irreversible) before affected \nparties hear of it having been undertaken; a fait accompli can wait for an official \nraison d\u2019etre\u201d (Oxford English Dictionary, 1989) \n \n \n \nSocial psychology has traditionally dealt with social influence in relation to inter-subjective \nnorms, our mutual expectations regarding belief, opinion and attitude towards the world and \npeople; it deals with how we think and act, and how we ought not to. My motivation to \nexplore artefacts as types of social influence stems from years of research and teaching on \ncontroversies related to nuclear power, information technology and genetic engineering. In \nthis context it appears that social psychology, because it has little to say about \n\u2018objectification\u2019, is relegated to the role of \u2018acceptance provider\u2019 for the \u2018fait accompli\u2019. \nPsychology is called to offer a \u2018box of tricks\u2019 to persuade and to influence a sometimes \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 1 \nreluctant public to adopt new products, and to prevent and counter-act \u2018ill-informed\u2019 \nresistance to technological projects. This might be satisfactory to create opportunities for \nconsultants and cohorts of university students, but it does not satisfy theoretical aspirations. I \nwill explore in this paper avenues to render social psychology theoretically relevant for more \nthan a good ride on the back of technocratic dreams.  \n \n \nSunnyville: a story of somewhere \n \nLet us start with the story of a small town called \u2018Sunnyville\u2019. Mr and Mrs Wall and their \nthree children live in a comfortable house. The extended front garden is open into the street \nwhere people pass by going after their daily routine. The town\u2019s children are playing in the \nstreet, and occasionally they extend their playground into Wall\u2019s immaculately kept lawn. \nFrom time to time cars appear on the lawn, in particular when a concert in the nearby Park \ncreates a shortage of parking space. Also, drunkards and hooligans litter the lawn during their \nnightly sprawls. Mr Wall and his family feel that their garden should be a no-go-area and \neveryone should respect the boundary between public street and private lawn. How might \nthey achieve this?  \n \nMr Wall is a respected community elder and has acted for years as the mayor of Sunnyville. \nOne day Mr Wall calls a community meeting to discuss the unclear boundary of his garden \nand the attitudes and actions of passers-by. He hopes to define once and for all, what is street \nand what is lawn, and how to behave accordingly. Thus, a new communal norm is established, \nin a manner of compromise after different views were duly heard: henceforth, the street\/lawn \nboundary will be marked with a line of small stones in the lawn.  Everybody seems happy and \nnormal life in Sunnyville resumes.  \n \nThen newcomers arrive in town. They have little knowledge of the community, and \u2018misuse\u2019 \nthe lawn of the Wall family. Wall takes advise from a local \u2018hermit\u2019 who suggests that \nnewcomers may be too busy or cognitively challenged to take notice of local habits. They \nhave no time or are unable to consider any issue in depth, they would need some \u2018cues\u2019 to fall \nin line. Mr Wall designs a leaflet entitled \u2018Do Not Trespass!\u2019. He describes beautiful and \npeaceful Sunnyville and offers a history that accounts for the boundary between lawn and \nstreet. He stresses his status as town mayor, and urges everyone to abide by the rule under \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 2 \nthreat of naming and shaming, or even exclusion from the community. This leaflet is widely \ndistributed and handed to every newcomer upon arrival. It works; the newcomers respect the \nrules. However through rumours, Mr Wall discovers that not all communards are in \nagreement. Some disagree with him in private, while publicly they keep quiet and stick to the \nnorm. Wall steps up his leaflet campaign, revising it to stress how beautiful and peaceful this \ntown is and deserves to continue to be.  \n \nSoon, some ignominious few \u2013 and it turns out they are the people behind the town\u2019s Rock \nconcerts \u2013 start to voice dissent and to challenge the demarcation between lawn and street. \nWall is worried that this challenge might be \u2018contagious\u2019, in particular the local youth might \nbe prone to imitate those admired \u2018musical heroes\u2019. He is particularly apprehensive about \nlarge public gatherings. He has recently read a book by an author called LeBon. Apparently, \npeople in groups are out of their usual minds, and prone to listen to demagogy.  \n \nIndeed, the small group of sworn music lovers gains momentum expounding \u2018drivel and \nabuse\u2019 (according to Wall\u2019s friends) in the local pubs and by picketing the Town Hall. \nWomen\u2019s gossip alerts Wall that many townsmen are beginning to dither. Wall calls a Town \nhall meeting to hear the arguments. After much to and fro, new boundaries and rules are \nestablished: cars are now allowed to park on the lawn on concert days, and children may play \nthere on Wednesdays after school, and during religious holidays. The community norm has \nshifted. Mr Wall, his family and friends gave way, they were persuaded that the previous \nboundary was wrong, but also that the new agreement will keep the peace.  \n \n \nThe classical psychology of social influence \n  \nWhat is the point of this slightly unrealistic story? The story shall illustrate how social \npsychology conceives of social influence (see the fine overview of Paicheler, 1988) and how \nthis might be limited.  \n \nSocial psychology studies the establishment of norms within the paradigm of normalisation: \na group is constituted by the establishment of an aggregate compromise of how to see things. \nThis compromise establishes a frame of reference to which participant are committed (Sherif, \n1936). The modalities of how to sustain an established norm and attitude in the face of \nchallenge is the focus of experiments on majority influence (Asch, 1952). It is demonstrated \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 3 \nthat peer pressure enforces conformity with rules by capitalising on the human need for \naffiliations: the individual avoids social exclusion (in relation to others), but also tries to \nreduce uncertainty (in relation to the object world) by listening to others, and to maintain a \npositive self-evaluation (in relation to the self). The obedience and compliance paradigm \n(Milgram, 1974) dramatically demonstrates the power of authority. A \u2018man in white coat\u2019 is \nable to stall moral inhibitions and make everyman inflict harm on others in the name of \nscience or some other respected cause. By complying to moral and scientific authority which \nwe invest with reasonable trust, we abdicate control, enter an \u2018actant state\u2019, and potentially \nbehave abhorrently. Many studies explore how obedience and compliance is contingent and \ntherefore expressive of culture (Blass, 2000). The paradigm of minority influence \n(Moscovici, 1976; Maass & Clark, 1984; Mugny & Perez, 1991) demonstrates how \nestablished norms change under dissent and introduces the distinction between active and \npassive deviance. Consistent active minorities inform the majority and lead them to reconsider \ntheir take on the world. Organised minorities influence by inducing a latent conversion among \nthe majority but misses out on the credit for achieving this: the \u2018sleeper effect\u2019 assures that we \nremember the message but not its source. This all suggests two different processes of social \ninfluence: majorities achieve conformity in public, while dissent might continue in private; \nminorities make us rethink privately, while we still conform publicly, but maybe only for a \nwhile. Minorities induce a rethink about the world (informational processes), while majorities \nmake us consider others (normative processes). In inter-group action these processes are \nnested: an active minority needs conformity among its members to assure that it can act and is \nperceived consistent which is the key to its potential success among the majority (e.g. \nCranach, 1996).  \n \nThese paradigms have a rational core \u2013 people yield to influence by assessing claims to be \nmorally right, true and authentic - which contrasts with older theories that stress the \nirrationality of social influence. LeBon\u2019s Crowd Psychology (1895) and Tarde\u2019s Laws of \nImitation (1890) modelled unconscious human suggestibility. Human association in public \nspaces alters, according to LeBon, rationally minded individuals into shadows of themselves, \nreduces them to \u2018passive masses\u2019 waiting to be manipulated by a determined leadership. \nIrrespective of whether this theory ever was a valid analysis of collective behaviour or more a \nfin-de-siecle expression of moral panic, it received widest reception amongst societal elites \nwell into the 20th century (van Ginneken, 1992). Tarde (1890) elaborated the theme of social \ncontagion. Similarities in mores and behaviours arise from genetic inheritance or social \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 4 \nimitation. What common ancestry cannot explain, must do the laws of imitation: for \nexample, imitation follows the social hierarchy top-down (but consider today\u2019s Haut-Couture, \nit seems to work bottom-up as Punk elements enter the main stream); or inward change \nanticipates outward change, thus the imitation of thinking and feeling precedes the copying of \nbehaviour (this idea lives on in minority influence and conversion). The ad-hoc nature of \nthese regularities is demonstrated by \u2018thirst is stronger than hunger\u2019 which apparently \nexplained the prevalence of alcoholism over obesity in the late 19th century. The recent \nrevival in theories of contagion focuses on \u2018memes\u2019 in analogy to genes (e.g. Lynch, 1996). \nContagion and suggestibility is not a rational process, but subliminal and atavistic. \nApparently, certain \u2018content features\u2019 make some beliefs stick and others not, and universally \nso. The revival of  the \u2018doctrine of suggestion\u2019 often merges with the polemical tradition of \n\u2018debunking\u2019: the sport of denouncing as \u2018Mumbo-Jumbo\u2019 the \u2018false beliefs\u2019 that carry the \npopular imagination (Wheen, 2004; Mackey, 1841).  \n \nPost-WW II paradigms of social influence research show that \u2018suggestibility\u2019 has a rational \ncore: preserving a relationship of trust within a community. The total suspension of reason is \nat most a special case (Asch, 1952; Moscovici, 1985). Being influenced allows for rational \nconsiderations of the state of the world and the effectiveness of action, the handling of social \nrelationships and the maintenance of a positive self-concept. However, the moral problem \nremains whether seeking influence is a strategic action with the purpose of seeking unilateral \nsuccess or whether it is part of communicative action to reach a common understanding \n(Habermas, 1981).       \n \n \nReconsidering the psychology of social influence \n \nLet us go back to Sunnyville. This story is far from a complete account of any similar \nsituation that might occur in real life. Let us explore some of the real-life issues.  \n \nFirstly, it appears that underpinning the story of Mr Wall is the existence of a community of \npeople with \u2018civic commitment\u2019, who will follow calls for meetings to discuss and agree an \namicable compromise, enforce these by naming and shaming contravening persons, and shift \ntheir opinions in the light of strong arguments. It is assumed that the \u2018guns are silent\u2019 and \nneither violence nor authority play a part. The story as well as the experiments of social \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 5 \npsychology, which stage social influences for the purposes of research, assume such a context \nas a condition sine qua non. However, this moral community might be an \u2018ethnocentric\u2019 \ndesirable, historically situated, rather than a universal fact.   \n \nSecondly, the attempts of the Walls to protect their garden from undue trespassing will be, at \nleast in the context of modern societies, within the statutory law, formally written and \nenforced by courts and a state monopoly for force. This should guarantee the Walls their \nproperty and testify the boundaries of their estate. However, formal law requires a general \nattitude of respect towards the law, which binds the community to a context wider than itself. \nIf property is trespassed, it becomes a matter for the police to enforce the law under \npunishment of fines or prison. In real life, the Walls might call the police rather than a \ncommunity meeting. Furthermore, property law and the highway code are part of the \nconstitution of the land. Sunnyville is not an isolated world onto itself, but linked to other \nentities through the legal constitution.  \n \nThirdly, in real life Mr Wall is likely to build a fence or a solid wall to avoid trespassing. \nRather than relying on a toothless sign \u2018Do Not Trespass!\u2019, or on the occasional police patrol, \nsimple brickwork will do the job most effectively. This technical solution, an artefact, will \ndemarcate, solidify and objectify the boundary. It will lead those unfamiliar and even those \nwho might dissent to behave properly on that patch of land. This wall will do many things, \nand it is important to know how it came about. Several scenarios are thinkable.  \n \nMr Wall might have called a town meeting, argued his case, listened to others, and obtained \nconsent to build the wall between his garden and the street. The wall will become a feature of \nthe community. Thus the wall was built in a civic spirit where common understanding \nprevails over the instrumental attitude of particular interests: a solution was found that works, \nthat is morally right, and with the promised mural paintings, it might also be aesthetically \npleasing. Much of this scenario describes the public deliberation that is modelled on the \nassemblies in 18th century New England religious communities or London coffee houses \n(Habermas, 1962). \n \n \nIn a different scenario, Mr Wall put up the wall as a \u2018fait accompli\u2019, quasi over-night, and \ncounts on the normative power of facts: what is, ought to be. Artefacts are strong enforcers in \nand of themselves. A wall functions as a physical \u2018lock-out\u2019, keeping people out or dissuading \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 6 \ncertain actions: only the most determined and able bodied will make the effort to climb, \ntaking the risk of injury or ruining their clothes. Long Island bridges were built too low for \npublic transport and thus kept out, at the time of construction, poorer people who depended on \npublic transport. Or gadgets are built so that you cannot open and repair them, you can only \nbuy new ones. A wall might also be a \u2018lock-in\u2019, preventing people from leaving a space. \nAnother lock-in are skills and habits built around a certain word processing programme. To \nshift to another one is too complicated, so one is loyal to a product that one learnt to handle \nmany years ago, and dutifully updates the software on a regular cycle whatever the costs. The \nSunnyville wall also \u2018inter-locks\u2019: to reach the park behind Walls\u2019 house, people have to go \naround the house rather than through the garden. With inter-locks, designers ensure that one \naction is a necessary antecedent of another. So, we might be required to fasten a seatbelt \nbefore the car engine will start, or, at an ATM machine, take our card before the money is \ndispensed. Hotel keys are too big to carry so we leave them at the hotel reception before we \nleave the Hotel for the day (see for a general discussion, Brey, 2005). Designers talk of \n\u2018captology\u2019, persuasive design (Fogg, 1998) and \u2018emotional design\u2019 (Norman, 2004) to \nhighlight their powers to mould attitudes and behaviour of users. Objects are in-scripted with \nactions, and \u2018feel good\u2019 things are desirable and work better. Artefacts influence people \ndirectly and subconsciously. A wall offers affordances (Gibson, 1977), i.e. perceptual \ncharacteristics linked to certain actions: most people will see the wall \u2018to be respected\u2019, \u2018not to \nclimb\u2019 and \u2018to walk along\u2019, and that relatively to a whole range of motive. Only a well trained \nclimber intending to trespass might see a \u2018surface to climb\u2019, where most others would just see \n\u2018a barrier\u2019; but there might be an electrified wall top to dissuade also the former. The wall \nframes the life of passers-by in Sunnyville. Parking and sunbathing on the lawn is now \nimpossible, and this very intention will fade from the range of local leisure activities. The \nimperative of a moral appeal or a police patrol is delegated to brickwork (Latour, 1994). \nFunctionally equivalent for achieving the desired outcome, it might even be cheaper and more \neffective. The wall enforces itself: through direct pain of collision or through the anticipation \nof electrocution.  \n \nThe Sunnyville wall has been embellished with murals by a famous artist and has become a \nlocal venue, a symbol of local identity, attracting sightseeing tourist to a piece of renowned \nartistic expression. Erecting a wall to manage community relations is just one of many \u2018social \nconstructions\u2019, it is a technical solution to a problem in community life. What is less clear for \nwalls is more in evidenced with other artefacts: tools require the physiological and \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 7 \npsychological adjustment of the user. Boesch (1997) shows how a violin player, in her \nstruggles with the recalcitrant instrument, gains a posture and senso-motoric agility of fingers, \narms and shoulders, and buys into a culture and a utopian project: the \u2018Apollonian\u2019 ideal of \nproducing \u2018the pure sound without noise\u2019. This aesthetic quest for the purity of the \u2018sound \nobject\u2019 more than any other potential outcome sustains the painful efforts of practicing. More \ngenerally, the presence of artefacts re-presents how a community wants to live; an object is a \nproject for a subject (Bauer & Gaskell, 1999).   \n \nThe brick wall brings peace and quiet, but it also makes dependent. Somebody supplies the \nbricks and bricklaying. With years the wall will decay, so repairs are needed. This not only \nties the Walls to the building trade, but the building trade itself is variously locked into skills, \nstandards and machinery beyond rational control (David, 1985). Artefacts are places where \nthe present meets the past: whoever engages the wall, engages with an entire chain of people \nwho contributed in a distant past: brick makers, bricklayers, engineers and their frameworks \nof rationality that include utopian visions of a better world. Thus past actions frame present \nand future behaviour. The wall tells us what not to do, here and now, and thus takes us into its \nreasons past. The wall adds to an infrastructure of cars, streets, houses, energy supply, \ncomputers, and everyday gadgetry. It adds to the societal constitution of artefacts and their \nafforded routines, the inter-objectivity (Latour, 1996). It is therefore not surprising that many \npeople sense that such powerful artefacts should require public consent. Artefacts like social \nnorms require legitimacy; their sheer facility seems not enough. They require reasoned \nconsistency with values and ambitions. However, we face a traditional asymmetry here: that \nnew norms need legitimacy is the very business of politics. However that new artefacts need \nlegitimacy seems not be taken for granted. First, we need to recognise that artefacts are the \ncontinuation of politics by other means, thus artefacts are political, too (Winner, 1985). \n \nIn my story the mural solution of Sunnyville is a metonymy for technological solutions in \ngeneral. One of the key issues for Mr Wall is to ensure that his brickwork is legal and is seen \nto be legitimate. Therefore the question of due process arises: how has the wall come about, \nwas consent given, or how can consent be achieved after the fact? Is this consent binding for \nnewcomers?  \n \nIf Wall constructed his wall as a fait-accompli, he would have hoped that people will find \ngood reasons to accept the wall. A fait-accompli apparently can wait for its raison d\u2019etre. The \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 8 \ninter-subjectivity of norms the problem of establishment, enforcement, and redesign in the \nface of dissent is relatively well understood, as I showed above. By contrast, the inter-\nobjectivity of artefacts is largely seen as a matter of \u2018conformity\u2019 and \u2018compliance\u2019 after \nhaving been put into place by an authority of experts. Technical artefacts are the remit of \nscientists and engineers, and the role of social psychology is offer a box of tricks to secure \npublic acceptance in the market place and in the arena of politics. Technocrats see in \nuninformed political interference, and the public is assumed to be uninformed, a recipe for \ndisaster; they fear a \u2018cow designed by a committee\u2019.  \n \n \nIn modern societies the process of establishing, enforcing, and changing of norms happens \nwithin a public sphere buttressed by the freedom of speech and mass communication (which \nis my fourth point of unreality in Sunnyville). Issues are aired, circulated, brought to attention \nin public forums mediated by professionals according to operating rules: newsprint, radio, \ntelevision or the internet generating genres of communication. The making and breaking of \nnorms takes place in this formal context, and no longer exclusively in face-to-face interaction. \nWe must ask: how do the public sphere and face-to-face interaction, as modelled by social \npsychological experiments, go together? \n \n \nLet us go back to Sunnyville one more time. Mr Wall, faced with the need to defend his wall, \nconsiders using the mass media for legitimizing his mural fait accompli. His previous use of \nleafleting was already a rudimentary form of mass communication. But now larger guns are \nmobilised. He and \u2018friends in high places\u2019 have the initial advantage, but their story line is not \nguaranteed. Mass media are part of an information market, more or less free, that balances \nnews with the tastes and interests of large audiences. Here the voices of dissent might have an \nopening. The initially small group of dissenters is an \u2018active minority\u2019, who by consistent and \npersistent agitation draws attention to their cause: the wall is not an acceptable solution. They \nmight organise a press officer with friends in the media, who feeds the mass media with \nstories on the \u2018Scandal of Sunnyville\u2019. Resistance might take the form of nightly sabotage to \nthe wall; or more symbolically, \u2018guerrilla marketing\u2019 (Amann, 2005) is staged in front of TV \ncameras that make the national news. The wall issue might become a main news item. Thus, \nthe issue is reframed in the wider public: the \u2018Peace and Comfort in Beautiful Sunnyville\u2019 \n(sponsored by Wall and his friends) becomes the \u2018The Ugly Abuse of Power in Sunnyville\u2019 \n(sponsored by the active dissenters). Faced with a barrage of media coverage, Mr Wall and his \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 9 \nfriends can no longer ignore the local resistance. Like reacting to physical pain, they \nreluctantly recognise that \u2018something is wrong\u2019, they re-examine the issue and warm to a \nchange of mind and project (Bauer, 1995). With the help of \u2018hermit\u2019 advice, Mr Wall \nreconsiders the situation. He begins to see the wall in the light of the \u2018lock-out\u2019 it creates; his \nrelationship to the community changes from a paternalistic attitude to one of \u2018enlightened \ncitizenship\u2019; and he consider a redesign of the wall or even its dismantling. Ironically, the \nlatter might not be necessary, because as local resistance succeeds the mural artefact becomes \na symbol of \u2018evil overcome\u2019. Thus a part of the wall will be preserved as \u2018local heritage\u2019 \n(Breeze, 2000). Resistance fosters social identities and reassures existentially: \u201cJe me revolte, \ndonc nous sommes\u201d [I dissent, there we are] (Camus, 1965, 432).  \n \nThe development of technological projects is tied, on a much larger scale than the Sunnyville \nwall, to the association of people and things into a common purpose. This suggests that \ntechnology is a quasi-social movement that mobilises resources and anticipates, confronts, \nassimilates and accommodates resistances and navigates the future like an expedition into \nunknown territories driven forward by the quest for El Dorado (Sloterdijk, 2005; Bauer, \n2002). To study the contributions of resistance to technological projects is therefore a \nnecessary compliment to the bias for innovation in technology management, and this is a part \nof a research programme on the development of genetic engineering in the late 20th century \n(Bauer, 2005; Bauer & Gaskell, 2002; Bauer, 1995).  \n \nExcursion: recovering the fait-accompli in the making  \n \nModels of influence focus on the \u2018soft side\u2019, the intangible inter-subjectivity of mutual \nexpectations (norms) and shared judgements (attitudes) that constitute social groups and inter-\ngroup behaviour. However, Asch (1952, p178) still noted that social interaction has a twofold \noutcome with relative permanence: social norms and technical artefacts. But henceforth social \npsychology specialised in the making and breaking of inter-subjective norms, while \n\u2018objectivity\u2019 became a principle of methodology rather than a phenomenon in its own right. \nThe focus of social influence research is on \u2018soft\u2019 inter-subjectivity, face-to-face \ncommunication, while the \u2018hard\u2019 inter-objectivity of affordances and \u2018persuasive designs\u2019 \ndoes not enter the frame.  \n \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 10 \nIt is not entirely a novel concern to include artefacts in the remit of social psychology. \nAlready, Wundt\u2019s \u2018V\u0151lkerpsychologie\u2019 had such ambitions in the late 19th century (see Farr, \n1983). Equally, Mueller-Freienfels, a psychologist of the inter-war years, urged in his  \n\u2018Psychology of Science\u2019 (1936) and in his \u2018Social and Cultural Psychology\u2019 (1930) that we \nneeded to consider objectifications (externalisation) and subjectification (internalisation), the \ntwo processes of achieving world and social adequacy in human activities. In the 1920s, \napplied psychology distinguished \u2018Objekt-Psychotechnik\u2019 - the design of objects to fit human \nanatomy, physiology and psychology (later to become Ergonomics) \u2013 from \u2018Subject-\nPsychotechnik\u2019 - the adaptation of people to tools and machines through training of \nmotivation and skills and the selection on traits. The latter came to prevail in applied \npsychology; although late 20th century work psychology, based on activity theory, has a more \nbalanced record (see Frese & Zapf, 1994).  \n \nAnders (2002), musicologist and psychologist, called for a thing-psychology in the 1950s to \nbreak the mental stupor that modern civilisation apparently suffered in the face of technology. \nWe seem awe-struck as if technology was sacred, terrifying and fascinating (\u2018Der heilige \nSachzwang\u2019 according to Heinrich Boell). Anders saw human relations dominated by object-\nrelations; however this fact was taboo and not perceptible. Social psychology\u2019s bias towards \ninter-subjectivity is an ideological frame of mind clouded by the logic of powerful machinery. \nIt was the technocratic outlook which was shared across the ideological divides of the Iron \nCurtain. Anders was thinking in the context of the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \n \nMore recently Joerges (1988) reminded psychologists of the dominant ex-post facto concept \nof artefacts: Firstly, diffusion researchers profile psychological types of people by their timing \nof acceptance, e.g. early adopters, late adopters and laggards, and to change their attitudes by \ndesigning \u2018sticky messages\u2019 for formal and informal communication (Valente & Rogers, \n1995). Secondly, attitude researcher consider artefacts only ex-post-facto for the making or \nbreaking of subjectivity. Attitudes to not-(yet)-existing facts are treated as a measurement \nproblems: people will express opinions on anything if asked, and these are often \u2018non-\nattitudes\u2019. Attitude research says nothing on how objects come about, and the role played by \nattitudes in that. Thirdly, people cope symbolically with novel artefacts and associated \ndangers (e.g. Wagner et al, 2002; Joffe, 2003). The stress metaphor \u2018coping\u2019 suggests \nreactivity ex-post-factum. Similarly, cognitive dissonance modelled how people adjust their \nmentality to a fait-accompli. People balance any conflicts of after-thoughts by foregrounding \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 11 \nthe positive outcomes and ignoring the negative ones, so that the act appears as reasonable in \nhindsight. It does not matter how the act came about, by impulse or by affordance of a fait-\naccompli. And surprisingly the lesser the reward, the more we find good reasons in the act \nitself (for a review see Eagly & Chaiken, 1993, p505ff). Fourthly, artefacts have symbolic \nvalue. Possessions defer identity by marking social status and individual self-expression in \npublic and private spaces (Habermas, 1999). The meaning of artefacts goes beyond use-value, \nbut again they exist a-priori. And finally, in the ontogenetic perspective \u2018thing constancy\u2019 \nsignals the demise of infantile ego-centrism, as the child enters the given world. The self-\nother differentiation, role-playing and the acquisition of symbolic language open the child to \nhigher cognitive functions that are needed for tool making and other achievements of human \nlife. But again the child seems to arrive in a pre-existing world, albeit this remains a contested \nissue for educationalists.  \n \nThe assumption of objects ex-post-facto buttresses the traditional focus on inter-subjectivity. \nSocial psychology has little to say about objectfication, the making and breaking of artefacts \nas social influence. Why this blind spot? Social psychology is not isolated here, but shares a \nheritage of shying away from giving \u2018hard\u2019 facts their due with other social sciences. The \nterm \u2018inter-objectivity\u2019 has recently been introduced by Latour (1996) to mark this malaise for \nsociological thinking. An anxiety of attributing influence to objects prevails which is traceable \nto Biblical or equivocal iconoclasm and polemic against fetishism. A \u2018fetish\u2019 is a thing with \nagency. The separation of a realm of causality (nature) and a realm of agency (society), and \nthe cleansing of nature from agencies is the culmination of a long process of disenchantment \nand rationalisation of the world, however incomplete (Boehme, 2006; Keane, 2003; \nFestinger, 1983). The dualistic fallacy - nature there, society here - buttresses the view that \nartefacts are EITHER inevitable Progress OR fetish type reification to be smashed, because \nthey alienate us from our real concerns. It is important to see that they are neither, but are part \nof a changing societal constitution that requires legitimacy.   \n \n \nExcursion: face-to-face or mass communication \n \nSocial psychological experiments, like those on majority and minority influence, gave \ngenerations of college students, obliged to participate in these exercises, their degrees (Sears, \n1986), and social psychology its \u2018scientific credentials\u2019. The laboratory stages ad-hoc groups \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 12 \nmeetings, and recently also computer-mediated interaction. Generalisations of results from \nthese paradigms must be limited to these types of situations. This is not a problem, when the \ncontingencies of the laboratory are clearly defined (Hovland, 1959; Farr, 1984). Many of \nthese experiments gain renewed relevance in deliberative policy making which involves face-\nto-face focus groups, public forums, and consensus conferences for controversial areas of \npolicy making. However, the power of these paradigms is limited in modern mass media \nsystems. Modern social life is a mixture of informal and formal communication. Social \ninfluence is underspecified when we consider these parallel modes of communication. \nFormalized communication provides an environment for face-to-face interactions and vice-\nversa. How do we conceptualise compromise, conformity, compliance and conversion when \ncommunication is one-to-many and professionalized into genres of print mass media, radio, \ntelevision, and internet?  \n \nLet us go back to Sunnyville one more time, where some \u2018ignominious few\u2019 raised the doubts \nover the mural solution. Mr Wall might, with the help of \u2018hermits\u2019 that know about these \nthings, attempt to control the mass media: he puts dissent into disrepute, presents the mural \nsolution as legitimate, praises his wall as a \u2018revolutionary design using hi tech materials\u2019, and \ndeplores the split of the community when unity is required in a ongoing dispute with central \npowers; he might try to force the pen of the editor by threatening to retract from a Town \nadvertising contract. For his and the interests of the community are the same. For the casual \nreader of the Sunnyville Tribune it will appear that majority opinion supports the wall. A \nstraw poll taken by the newspaper puts the figures at 63% in favour, 18% against, 19% \nundecided (n=117). The headline reads \u2018Majority Supports Wall\u2019. Dithering citizens of \nSunnyville will take this as a cue on the majority opinion and a reason to conform: few like to \nbe brandished as a \u2018dissident\u2019. Noelle-Neumann (1990) called this dynamic a \u2018spiral of \nsilence\u2019: dominant press coverage is experience as peer pressure. Dissenters increasingly shut \nup and withdraw into private exile. This spiral, difficult to demonstrate experimentally, is \nworking reliably in circumstances where a real community feels \u2018under siege\u2019 from \nthreatening adversaries.  \n \nA different scenario involves the mobilisation of expert opinions in mass media. Mr Wall \nfound a famous Professor of Law and an equally high profile Historian of Architecture who \ntestify that the wall solution is consistent with the law of the land and a \u2018vanguard\u2019 \ncontribution to local landscape and architectural history by its fusion of technical and \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 13 \naesthetic concerns. Rothman (1990) argued that \u2018consensual expert opinion\u2019, in the context of \ntechno-scientific controversies, carries the opinions of a dispersed public audience. What in \nMilgram\u2019s experiments was the \u2018white coat\u2019 of the experimenter and his appeal to the \n\u2018scientific purpose of a learning experiment\u2019, is in the context of Storyville the consensual \nexpert opinion on the mural solution: an ethos driver of public opinion.  \n \nFinally, I reconsider the dissidence scenario of Sunnyville. The \u2018ignominious few\u2019 managed \nto reopen the wall a public issue after what appeared to be a close issue, put it onto the agenda \nof Sunnyville. And finally the wall was rerouted and partially dismantled. How did they \nsucceed? Not only did the sworn dissenters organise loud music events in the park, and picket \nthe wall, but they actively sought the attention of the mass media. Newspaper coverage was \ngiven to their protest and the local radio station broadcasted several interviews where the \nactivists could make their case. Through consistent action and public pronouncements over a \nperiod of time they convinced themselves that \u2018the wall had to move\u2019 and created a climate of \nopinion, where people paid attention to the issue and reconsidered the arguments. Finally a \nmajority spoke against Wall in the Town Hall meeting. A determined group of activists \nmanaged to set the agenda in Sunnyville and reframe the issue: the \u2018threat to the community \npeace\u2019 became \u2018a Scandal in Sunnyville\u2019. In the research literature this dynamic is analysed as \nagenda setting (McCombs & Shaw, 1993) and issue framing (Entman, 1993; Scheufele, \n1999).   \n \nMedia effects research, a historical spin-off of social psychology, moved to a new discipline: \nMedia & Communication Studies. One looks in wane for media effects in recent handbooks \nof social psychology. However, it is necessary to articulate the reality of mass communication \nfor a theory of social influence; otherwise social influence research will have limited \nrelevance beyond passing exams. The recent handbook literature on social influence (Martin \n& Hewstone, 2001 & 2003; Caldini & Trost, 1998; Petty & Wegener, 1998; Chaiken, Wood \n& Eagly, 1996; Miller & Prentice, 1996) reduces this field of many paradigms to two theories \nof cognitive information processing: central and peripheral. The \u2018cognitive miser\u2019 follows the \nprinciples of \u2018least effort\u2019 (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) and \u2018sufficiency\u2019 (Chaiken, 1987) when \nseeking a judgement upon being exposed to the images and sound bites of product \nadvertising. Experiments abound, even automated via computer and internet, in an attempt to \nconstruct \u2018sticky\u2019 messages cued and clued up for particular groups of respondents. The \nattitude change appears to happen in isolated minds, taking the moral community for granted \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 14 \nthat constitutes these individual dupes in the first place (see Taylor, 1989). This unfortunately \nreflects the discipline\u2019s consensus (see also Martin & Hewstone, 2003) which is unable to \nappreciate the formation of norms and values. Norms and values are given constraints on \ninformation processing, even genetically hard-wired (as in evolutionary psychology). Other \npeople are bundles of emitted stimuli that are processed EITHER with conscious effort, \nsystematically and centrally, elaborating the registered messages as arguments, OR \nperipherally, as heuristic and effortless processing of cues of recognition and of clues of \nallegiance. It is suggested that majority stimuli operate peripherally, while minorities \nstimulate central processes (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). The theoretically ambitious reader of \nsocial psychology looks in vane for guidance on how norms and artefacts, minorities and \nmajorities, conformity and dissent, persuasion and manipulation, authority and obedience, \ncentral and peripheral processing might be part and partial of social influence.     \n \n \nPersuasion and social influence by norms and artefacts \n \nThe final question arises, how can the social psychological paradigms of compromising, \nobedience and compliance, conformity and conversion be generalised from norms to \nartefacts? Needless to say, new ideas and things are invented, prototyped and standardised \n(normalised), they spread and are redesigned under majority and minority influences, and \nscientific and expert authorities play a crucial role in this process, so do the mass media. If \nnorms go through cycles of change and require legitimacy, so do artefacts. \n \nA theory of social influence might be best located within a theoretical context of conflict \nresolution by mutually accepted constraints. Norms and artefacts are constraints in a double \nsense, enabling as well as inhibiting social interactions, framing and guiding actions. Chaos \nand arbitrary force is the alternative. Humans command several ways of resolving conflicts: \nby violence (e.g. brute or military force), by appeal to authority (courts or epistemic \nauthorities), and by negotiations. A theory of social influence might model the modalities of \nthe latter under the presumption of non-violence.  \n \nSocial psychology has traditionally considered social influence and persuasion, a distinction \nthat is not entirely clear. In the textbook literature social influence falls into the dynamics of \ngroups that are structured into majority and minority segments, while persuasion refers to \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 15 \nindividual information processing in the context of attempted attitude change. Their relation is \ntheoretically unclear beyond common outcome: attitude change. Social influence assumes \nnormative and information processes, while persuasion mainly information processes. For our \npresent purposes it might be useful to use social influence as the generic term, and define \npersuasion as the \u2018morally sound\u2019 form of social influence. This allows us to flag up the sense \nof a moral boundary that pervades much research on social influence and persuasion: namely \nthe distinction between legitimate and illicit means. The boundary between persuasion and \nmanipulation is fuzzy, where manipulation denotes the use of illegitimate means of social \ninfluence. To give an example: difficult negotiations are conducted with good food, wine, \nmusic and dance performances, and this \u2018setting of the scene\u2019 which might dispose parties to \nbe persuaded more easily. Clearly people are persuaded by arguments under certain \ncircumstances, so setting these circumstances becomes part of the process, but where is the \nboundary between legitimate and illicit setting of the scene?  \n \nThis ties the theory of social influence into the discussions on the modern public sphere of \ncommunicative actions (see Habermas, 1981 and 2001), where persuasion and influence take \nplace shielded from violence - the \u2018gun is taken out of politics\u2019 to use a phrase from the \nNorthern Ireland conflict - and the recourse to authority is only a last resort (Personnaz & \nPersonnaz, 2001). The defining characteristics of a public sphere are inclusiveness and a code \nof conduct oriented on a counter-factual ideal: the simultaneous evaluation of claims made on \ntruth, rightness, and sincerity. The distinction between illocutionary and perlocutionary \nspeech acts mark the boundary between legitimate and illegitimate means, between strategic \nand communication action: people abstain from deception and self-illusion and \u2018participants \nhave to mean what they say\u2019 (Habermas, 2001, 34). Manipulation is \u2018strategic\u2019 in that it \nrestricts truth claims exclusively to what is either true, what is right or what is sincerely held \nin isolation and specialisation. What then counts is exclusively \u2018sound science\u2019, or legalism, \nor the politically correct motive, never mind the outcome. The \u2018all for one and one for all\u2019 of \nthe three musketeers, echoing the triad of logos, pathos and ethos of classical rhetoric of the \narena (see Hoeffe, 2005), is separated for manipulative purposes.  \n \nIn any real public sphere, representations are made under conditions of either power \nasymmetry or symmetry. With all parties equally empowered, the outcome will be \n\u2018normalisation\u2019 through deliberation and compromise. If the parties are unequal, either A-\nthe-stronger will urge B-the-weaker to conform, comply and act like As (assimilation), or B-\n10 November 2006 MB LSE 16 \nthe-weaker will manage to convert the As, to recognise, think and act a bit more like Bs \n(accommodation). Ironically, in order for B-the-weaker to be successful, the discipline of the \nactive minority must be enforced by conformity pressures; successful accommodation implies \nlocal assimilation. In this way it might become possible to see normalisation, assimilation and \naccommodation as phases of collective learning by structural change. Indeed, Duveen (2001) \npointed to a structural analogy between Piaget\u2019s concept of \u2018genesis\u2019 in child development - \nthe child balances the tensions of pretend play (assimilation) and schematic change \n(accommodation) with a series of spurts - and the \u2018genesis\u2019 of social representations and \ngroups with one crucial difference: for the latter one has to relinquish the notion of \ndirectedness. The telos of the child is to become an \u2018adult\u2019. However, there is no reasonable \nway anymore to conceive\u2018adulthood\u2019 for social groups and their mentality. This is where the \nconcept of \u2018social representation\u2019 leaves behind much Comtean Positivist baggage (see \nJovchelovitch, 2006). Social representations theory contributes to a theory of social change \nwithout a telos towards a point of culmination,  e.g. the Secular Republic or the Nation State. \nWhile it remains within the remit of this theory to see how teleological notions might play a \nrole as ideological contents, so for example in the tropes of change such as \u2018secularisation\u2019, \n\u2018Progress\u2019, \u2018scientific-technological revolution\u2019. These tropes are powerful appeals that fuel \nthe process of change, but not valid descriptions of the process itself.   \n \nI hope I made the case that we need to consider social influence of things and artefacts as we \ndo of norms and attitudes. Norms and things are social representations that make and break \nsocial influence. Over the last 20 years, research in technology studies has amply \ndemonstrated how artefacts are designed to influence behaviour, however not without conflict \nover how to conceptualise this. Artefacts have a history and as such are the continuation of \npolitics with \u2018other\u2019 means; while \u2018other\u2019 might falsely suggest \u2018means outside politics\u2019. Only \nthe unreflective and biased mind considers a new regulation as a provocation, but a new \ntechnology a case for celebration.  \n \nSocial influence works with inter-subjectivity and inter-objectivity. Taking up this challenge \nwill have theoretical and practical consequences. It might finally resolve the puzzle of how \nsocial representations and social influence are theoretically linked; and it will allow social \npsychologists to consider new technologies in the making and not just post-festum, as the \nattitude object \u2018fallen like pennies from heavens\u2019 about which opinions may differ. Social \npsychology and other social sciences will be enabled to look at the process of making and \n10 November 2006 MB LSE 17 \nbreaking of artefacts, and transcend the traditional role of encouraging social conformity to \nalready established facts. This extends the relevance of social psychology and preserves its \nrich tradition of research into social influence into the 21st century.   \n \n \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nI should like to thank Ivana Markova for comments and guidance on this paper, the colleagues \nof the Paris workshop of November 2005, and my LSE students on PS439 \u2018Science, \nTechnology and Resistance\u2019 course who read earlier drafts of the paper and commented to it \ndirectly and indirectly.  \n \n \n \n \nReferences  \n \nAmann M (2005) (ed) Go.Stop.Act \u2013 Die Kunst des kreativen Strassenprotests, Grefenau-\nFrankfurt, Trotzdem Verlag.  \n \nAnders G (2002) [1980] Die Antiquiertheit des Menschen vol 2, Munchen, CH Beck.  \n \nAsch S E (1952) Social Psychology, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, Prentice-Hall. \n \nBlass (2000) (ed) Obedience to authority: current perspective on the Milgram paradigm, \nMahwah, NJ, Erlbaum.  \n \nBauer MW (2005) Bauer MW \u2018The mass media and the biotechnology controversy, \nInternational Journal of Public Opinion Research\u2019, 17 (1), 5-22 (2005) [edited special issue] \n \nBauer MW (2002) Arenas, platforms and the biotechnology movement, Science \nCommunication, 24,2, 144-161. \n \nBauer, M (1995) Towards a functional analysis of resistance, in: Bauer M (ed) Resistance to \nnew technology, Cambridge, CUP,   \n \nBauer, M.
