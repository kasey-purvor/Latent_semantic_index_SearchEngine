This is especially important for applications where disposable devices are \nused for medical analysis. Micromoulding of thermoplastic polymers is a developing process with great potential for \nproducing low-cost microfluidic devices. Among different micromoulding techniques, micro -injection moulding is \none of the most promising processes suitable for manufacturing polymeric disposable microfluidic devices. This \nreview paper aims at presenting the main significant developments that have been achieved in different aspects of \nmicro-injection moulding of microfluidic devices.

Problems, challenges and potential areas for \nresearch are highlighted. \n \nKeywords: Micro-injection moulding, microfluidics, polymers, polymer processing\n 2 \n \nI. Introduction \n Microfluidics is a rapidly growing domain with many applications and a strong potential for development. The volume of \nmicrofluidic products was estimated to be approximately US$600 million in 2006, and the market was forecast to grow to \nUS$1.9 billion by 2012 [1]. Microfluidic devices are already used in a number of domains, including chemistry, \nbiotechnology and medicine. Prototype Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems are developing rapidly in several areas. 5 \n However, future mass-market usage of microfluidic devices is dependent on finding methods which will allow their \nmanufacture in large volumes and at low costs [2]. This is especially important for medical applications where, for \nsafety considerations, devices should be disposable to avoid cross contamination. In addition, from an economical \nviewpoint, a disposable device would not require maintenance or recalibration. Disposability is also useful in \nsituations where there might not be access to human or technical resources to retest or recalibrate a microfluidic device 10 \nfor multiple usages, e.g. when devices are used in certain point-of-care situations or in developing countries. \n For such mass-market applications, polymers possess several advantages over other materials, such as glass and \nsilicon, which have previously been used in constructing microfluidic devices (advantages and limitations of polymers \ndiscussed later in section 1.3). They are obtainable at relatively low cost, require relatively simple processing \ntechniques and can exhibit accurate repeatability in mass-production.  15 \n Several micromoulding techniques are available for the manufacturing of microfluidic devices from polymers. Of \nthese, micro-injection moulding is one technique that offers mass-production capabilities with relatively low costs. Its \nother advantages include short-cycle times, the potential for full-automation, accurate replication and dimensional \ncontrol as well as the existence of considerable know-how, transferable from conventional injection moulding. \n The introductory section briefly summarises the relevant basic concepts of microfluidics, micromoulding and micro-20 \ninjection moulding.  Reviews of the micromoulding of thermoplastics [3,4], polymeric microfluidic devices [5] and \nfabrication of microfluidics and micro-Total Analysis Systems (\u03bcTAS) [6-8] can also be found in the literature. \n Section II discusses the design of microfluidic structures that are mouldable by micro-injection moulding. \n Sections III through VI examine the challenges in mould and insert design, materials selection, moulding machine \ndesign and moulding process parameter optimisation for the micro-moulding of microfluidic components. 25 \n Section VII discusses modelling and simulation of micro-injection moulding, and Section VIII presents the state of \nthe art in post-ejection processes, which is particularly important for integrated systems. The outlook for micro -\ninjection moulding of micro-fluidic devices is discussed followed by a conclusion. \n1.1 Micromoulding \nMicromoulding is the process of transferring the micron or even submicron precision of microstructured metallic 30 \nmoulds to moulded polymeric products [9,10]. Several micromoulding techniques are currently available for \nfabricating microfluidic devices. They include micro-injection moulding, reaction injection moulding [11], hot \nembossing [12] and thermoforming [13]. \n  \n A precise definition for a micro-moulded part is usually controversial. Several authors [14-16,16-19] mention a set 35 \nof criteria for what is to be classified as a micro-moulded part. Such a part has one or more of the following \nspecifications: \n\uf06c It is weighs less than 1 mg, or it is a fraction of a polymer pellet, where a pellet can be approximated to be \nspherical in shape with an average diameter of approximately 3 mm. \n\uf06c It is a part with microstructured regions, or more specifically, with wall thicknesses less than 100 \u00b5m. Microfluidic 40 \ndevices usually fall in this category. \n\uf06c It is a micro-precision part, which is a part that can have any dimensions, but has tolerances in the micrometre \nrange, or more specifically, between 2-5 \u00b5m. \n Due to the continuous developments, micro-moulded parts are soon expected to exceed the limits specified in these \nliterature criteria. In fact, advances in micromoulding technology have already realized production of parts with 45 \nmasses of the order of micro-grammes [17]. \n1.2 Micro-injection moulding \nMicro-injection moulding is the process of transferring a thermoplastic material in the form of granules from a hopper \ninto a heated barrel so that it becomes molten and soft. The material is then forced under pressure inside a mould \ncavity where it is subjected to holding pressure for a specific time to compensate for material shrinkage. The material 50 \nsolidifies as the mould temperature is decreased below the glass-transition temperature of the polymer.  After \nsufficient time, the material freezes into the mould shape and gets ejected, and the cycle is repeated. A typical cycle \nlasts between few seconds to few minutes. The process has a set of advantages that makes it commercially applicable \nwith potential for further developments in the future. Advantages include the wide range of thermoplastics available \nand the potential for full-automation with short cycle times [10,20,21], cost-effectiveness for mass-production process, 55 \nespecially for disposable products [10,20,22-24], very accurate shape replication and good dimension control [20-22], \nlow maintenance costs of capital equipment, when compared to lithographic methods, fo r example [21] and \n 3 \n \napplicability of the large amount of industrial information and \u201eknow-how\u201f available from conventional injection \nmoulding.  Within certain limitations, this may be scaled down to micro-injection moulding. \nA comparison between micro-injection moulding and other techniques for microfluidic device manufacturing, such as \nhot-embossing and PDMS casting, is available in the literature [25]. \n 5 \n1.3 Applications for polymeric microfluidics \n Due to the rapid development in micro-injection moulding, it has been used for producing parts suitable for a wide \nrange of applications, which includes, for example: \n\uf0b7 Micro-optical applications, such as gratings, waveguides and lenses [9,15,23,26-28]. \n\uf0b7 Micro-mechanical applications, such as micro-springs, gears and miniaturized switches [9,15,26,27]. 10 \n\uf0b7 Sensors and actuators, such as sensors of flow-rates [23,27]. \n When it comes to microfluidics, micro-injection moulding is one of the main fabrication techniques to produce \npolymeric microfluidic devices for a number of applications, the majority of which are for medical diagnostics. \nExamples of polymeric microfluidics include components for micropumps, which are used for medical, chemical and \nenvironmental technology [9,10,15,26-28]. In industry, Bartels Microtechnik [29], for example, is specialized in 15 \nmicropumps for the delivery of small amount of fluids for different applications, such as point -of-care platforms or \nsmall fuel cells. The pumps are designed to be low in cost and disposable.  \n Reaction vessels and mixing structures are other commonly used microfluidic systems that are currently being \nproduced by micro-injection moulding [26,30]. On a commercial basis, Thinxxs [31], for example, produces a lab-on-\na-chip system for blood diagnostics. It includes functions such as sample absorption, separation, mixing with reagents, 20 \nanalysis and waste absorption. The \u201cSnake\u201d mixer slide is another commercially-available microfluidic system \ncomprising of a plastic chip with meander-shaped mixers that can mix fluids possessing a range of viscosities and at \ndifferent flow rates. \n DNA analysis systems such as bio-MEMS, \u00b5-TAS and Integrated LOC, which are typically manufactured of glass, \nare currently being manufactured in polymers [10,23]. Such integrated systems usually combine an entire process 25 \nchain, such as storage and waste vessels, transport channels, filters, mixing and separating structures, reaction \nchambers and detection points on a plastic substrate [10,15,27,30,32,33]. Mass-producing such integrated systems in \npolymers rather than glass would decrease their cost. Micralyne [34], for example, which is a company specialized in \nMEMS-based products, has decided to expand its manufacturing capabilities to include polymers as a lower -price \nalternative to glass [34]. 30 \n Other producers, such as Abbott [35] and Microfludic ChipShop [36] produce polymeric microfluidic platforms for \nmedical diagnostics and point-of-care applications. \n Micro injection moulding was also reported in the literature to be used for microfluidic applications, such as \ncapillary electrophoresis (CE) platforms [10,23,27,30,32], miniaturized heat-exchangers [26] and nanofilters [10]. \n Although several polymeric microfluidic systems have been made available commercially, it should be noted that 35 \ndue to process limitations, to be discussed in the following sections, the process is not fully implemented for relatively \ncomplex microfluidic systems. Integration of external elements, such as electrodes or micro-heaters, within a mass-\nproduction technique such as micro-injection moulding, still poses a major challenge for the technology. One of the \nmajor reasons for this limitation is the required price of the part compared with the costs of established techniques of \ninsertion or encapsulation by injection moulding [2]. 40 \n \n1.4 Using polymers for microfluidic applications \nSeveral materials have been used for producing micro-featured parts, for example glass and silicon. Nevertheless, \npolymeric materials show superior properties over glass and silicon for a number of reasons.  \n Polymers are relatively low in cost, especially for high-production disposable devices [37,38]. In addition, costs 45 \nare not greatly affected by the complexity of the design, as design complexity mostly impacts on mould design rather \nthan on the moulding process itself [3,10,39-41]. More discussion about designing for micromoulding is detailed in \nsection 2. \n Polymers have a wide variety of characteristic material properties, such as mechanical strength, optical \ntransparency, chemical stability and biocompatibility. They are therefore relatively easy to tailor to obtain required 50 \nproperties for processing and application [3,10,21,37,41-46]. \n Polymers have excellent replication fidelity, and if the optimum processing conditions are applied a typical \npolymer can completely fill and accurately replicate small features down to tens of nanometres. Due to the \nviscoelasticity of polymers, increasing the shear-rate and maintaining the polymer temperature above its Tg during the \nfilling stage would usually ensure a low viscosity enough for the polymer to fill the smallest mould details. Therefore, 55 \nthe quality of the moulded surface features is almost completely dependent on the quality and precision of the mould \n[21]. Experiments have been reported on using injection moulding to successfully replicate, for example, sub-micron \ntest features [47,48], sub-micron grating optical elements [22,49,50] and surfaces with nano-structured patterns [51,52] \nor nano-scale topography [53].  \n 4 \n \n Polymers offer good electrical insulation compared to silicon. For example, the conductivity of silicon has proved \nproblematic when applying high voltages necessary for the generation of electro-osmotic flow (EOF) [21,30].   \n On the other hand, polymers have some limitations related to their properties or processing techniques relative to \nglass. These include, for example, limited operation-temperature range, higher autofluorescence and limited well-\nestablished surface modification techniques. Table 1 presents a comparison between polymers and glass for 5 \nmanufacturing microfluidic devices, where information is compiled from the literature [5,21,30,34,43,54-57]. When it \ncomes to processing, mass-production processing techniques impose limitations on the mouldable geometry of the \nmicrofluidic device (more details on these limitations are reported in section 2). These geometrical limitations restrict \nthe flexibility of integrating external functional elements within a mass-manufacturing technique. \n Polymers Glass \nManufacturing costs Low in cost relative to glass, especially \nfor mass-production. \nHigher in cost, especially for relatively \nlarge-area substrates. Higher costs are \nalso associated with clean-room \nfacilities. \nFabrication complexity Fabrication steps are simpler than glass, \nand no wet chemistry is needed. \nTime consuming and expensive, and wet \nchemistry is used. \nClean room facilities Clean-room facilities are necessary for \napplications where avoiding \ncontamination with dust is critical. In \ncertain cases, particles may become \npressed into the polymer during \nprocessing without having an effect on \ndevice functionality. \nClean-room facilities are needed to avoid \ncontamination. \nProperties Wide selection of polymers, hence \nmechanical, optical, chemical and \nbiological properties can be tailored. \nLess variability in available properties \nrelative to polymers. \nOperation temperature Limited for polymers because of \nrelatively low Tg compared to glass. \nWider range of operation temperature \nrelative to polymers. \nOptical properties and \nfluorescence detection \nOptical transparency is lower than glass. \nExcept for special grades, polymers also \nhave higher autofluorescence relative to \nglass. \nExcellent optical properties;  \nautoflourecence levels do not affect \ndetection capabilities. \nBonding Different bonding options are available, \nfor example: adhesives, thermal fusion, \nultrasonic welding and mechanical \nclamping. \nTime consuming relative to polymers. \nBonding options include thermal, \nadhesive and anodic bonding. \nSurface treatment Surface treatment methods are availble \nfor polymers, but routine, well-\nestablished derivatization techniques are \nnot available. \nEstablished chemical modification \nprocedures for glass are available using \norganosilanes \nCompatibility with organic \nsolvents or strong acids \nExcept for some special grades, polymers \nare generally not compatible with most \norganic solvents and in some cases, \nstrong bases or acids. \nGood resistance to organic solvents and \nacids. \nJoule heating Subject to significant Joule heating \nbecause of low thermal conductivity. \nMore resistant to Joule heating relative \nto polymers. \nElectro osmotic flow (EOF) Smaller EOF produced relative to glass, \nbecause of lack of ionisable functional \ngroups. \nHigher EOF relative to polymers. \nGeometrical flexibility Polymer processing techniques offer \nmore flexibilty for geometrical designs, \nincluding for example different cross-\nsection (curved, vertical or V-groove), \nhigh aspect ratio square channels, \nchannels with a defined but arbitrary wall \nangle, or channels with different heights. \nLimited to 2\u00bd-D designs. Due to the \nisotropic nature of the etching process, \nonly shallow, low aspect ratio, mainly \nsemicircular channel cross-sections are \npossible in glass substrates.  \nPermeability to gasses Higher gas permeability relative to glass. Glass does not have the gas permeability \nrequired for some biological applications, \nsuch as living mammalian cells. \nTable 1 A comparison between polymers and glass properties with respect to their use for microfluidic applications  10 \n 5 \n \nII. Designing Mouldable Microfluidic Structures \nDesigning for conventional injection moulding takes into consideration a number of manufacturability aspects, such as \nthe part dimensions, the position and shape of the parting line, the existence of undercuts, mould-cavity features  in addition \nto tolerances and surface finishing [58]. A number of studies have suggested techniques to evaluate the complexity of \ninjection-moulded shapes with respect to replication and demoulding [59,60]. 5 \n It should be noted that very little is mentioned in the literature about rigorous criteria for designing microfluidic devices \nfor manufacturability by microinjection moulding. Most of design considerations focus on specific geometrical aspects such \nas achievable aspect ratios. This section will therefore focus on design criteria associated with the geometry of the moulded \npart rather than designing for functionality. The following subsections will highlight some generic design considerations for \ninjection-moulding, which are also important for micro-scale moulding (section 2.1). Design elements specific to 10 \nmicromoulding, such as aspect ratios and mouldable micro-features will also be reviewed (section 2.2). \n \n2.1 Shrinkage and shape stability in precision injection moulding \n \nDifferent forms of shape change takes place due to the thermal history of the injection moulded part. Volume changes 15 \ndue to part shrinkage, and shape distortions such as warpage, are common examples. \n Shrinkage occurs with the decrease in part volume due to the temperature change between the demoulding \ntemperature and the ambient temperature. The contraction in part volume affects the demoulding of the part due to the \nstresses induced upon contraction. One of the techniques to improve demoulding is by controlling the processing \nparameters and, hence, the shrinkage performance. Geometrical changes can also improve demoulding as will be 20 \nshown in the following section. Considering the feature placement, the further the features from the shrinking centre, \nthe harder demoulding becomes [3]. \nAnother factor that affects demoulding is the orientation of the polymer being injected, because this affects the direction \nat which shrinkage is most observed. Therefore, a design consideration for microfluidic substrates, should consider the path \nof polymer injection inside the mould [3]. Examples of experiments investigating flow direction are presented in section 2.5. 25 \n In addition to demoulding and feature replication, shrinkage affects shape stability in the form of induced warpage. \nWarpage is produced due to the non-uniformity of the shrinkage because of the residual stresses induced by the \ncomplex thermal variation inside the mould [61]. Warpage, was investigated in parts incorporating micro features \nusing a laser profilometer, and was reported to have an effect on micro-parts of the order of a few microns for a 3-mm \nlength [26]. Warpage prediction is important for parts with relatively large area compared to its thickness, e.g. 30 \nmicrofluidic chips. This is because the flatness of the chip is a demanding requirement for po lymeric microfluidic \nchips, considering that optimum sealing of a polymer chip, with a quality level compared to glass, would not be \nachievable without a minimum flatness level. Otherwise, costly intermediate layers would be needed which \ncompromises the economics of polymer mass-production. The flatness of the polymeric chip is affected by different \nfactors including the flatness of the replicated mould [62], the processing parameters [61,63] and the ejection process. 35 \nIn comparison to its importance, flatness and its control have received little emphasis in the literature.  \n In injection moulding it is not always possible to design an ideal cooling system, because the position of the cooling \nchannel is dependent on part geometry, cavity configuration and location of ejection mechanism. Thus, variation in \ntemperature across the moulded part should be expected depending on the geometry [61]. Cooling the mould is not \nalways required, especially when it is desired to keep the mould temperature above the T g of the polymer to ensure 40 \ncomplete filling of the mould cavity. \n Different techniques have been suggested to decrease the effect of shrinkage. One method is to increase the amount \nof holding pressure, which, on the other hand, will also increase stresses inside th e part [4]. Another technique is to \nhave a long cooling time (i.e. to allow the part to thermally equilibrate inside the mould cavity). This allows the \ntemperature to be approximately uniform. For precision moulding in particular, the part is likely to dis tort because of 45 \nlack of homogeneity in shrinkage, which is likely to occur if the cycle is terminated before the thermal equilibrium is \nreached, i.e. the part is ejected before its temperature is reduced to the ambient temperature [61]. Again, a trade-off of \nthis technique would be an increased cycle time. \n It should be noted that shrinkage is not identical throughout long runs. Therefore, moulded parts that need to be \nassembled in subsequent stages should be placed on the same mould [3]. 50 \n In addition to shape-changes, demouldability of injection-moulded components is also affected by the geometrical \nstructure of the component. Similar to conventional moulding, micromoulded parts should be designed to allow for \npart ejection from a two-half mould. Most microfluidic applications possess an undercut-free 2\u00bd-D geometry that is \nrelatively simple to demould. For more complex 3D shapes (or shapes with integrated functional elements) injection \nmoulding would not be applicable unless significant changes are made to the mould structure or subsequent assembly 55 \nsteps are integrated in the production process. \n Another geometrical consideration for successful demoulding is the existence of draft angles.  Draft angles and side-\nwall roughness need to be considered to ensure that the moulded plastic can be demoulded (Fig. 1). A positive draft \nangle of greater than \u00bc\u00b0 has been proposed for demoulding in plastic injection moulding [39]. \n 6 \n \n \nFig. 1 A micro-channel with a positive draft angle (nominal dimensions and actual channel) [39] \n \n2.2 Minimum channel dimensions and maximum aspect ratios (AR) for microfluidics \n Section 2.1 presented design-for-manufacturability criteria common for injection-moulding processes. This section 5 \nfocuses on geometry-related design criteria specific for injection-moulding microfluidic devices. Careful \nconsiderations should be given to the channel dimensions to ensure the complete filling of the mould cavity. Polymeric \nmelts can accurately fill microfeatures in the order of hundreds of nanometres. Therefo re, the minimum mouldable \ndimensions will be determined by the tool-manufacturing capabilities. Because micromoulding is under continuous \ndevelopment, it is not possible to specify a size limit below which microfeatures can no longer be replicated 10 \nsuccessfully. Nevertheless, it has been reported in the literature that it is possible to replicate surfaces with a squares \npattern having widths as small as 310 nm and heights of 220 nm [51]. In addition, optical grating elements of parallel \nwalls having a thickness of 200 nm and depth of 1600 nm has also been fabricated [22]. \nThe \u201chesitation effect\u201d is a phenomenon that can occur during the filling of polymers, and is common when an injection-\nmoulded part contains different thicknesses [20]. As shown in Fig. 2, this effect takes place when high-aspect-ratio 15 \nmicrostructures (usually larger than 2) are placed on a relatively thick substrate, which is the case for microfluidic devices. \n The polymeric melt tends to flow more easily into mould cavities with relatively lower resistance areas, i.e. areas of \ngreater cross section. Thus, the melt tends to fill the substrate completely before entering the micro -structured features \n(i.e. the flow stagnates at the entrance of micro-structures). This results in premature freezing because the filling time \nof the substrate is usually greater than the freezing time of the micro-feature. 20 \n \n \nFig. 2 Hesitation effect in high-aspect-ratio micro-cavities [20] \n  \n Taking the hesitation effect into consideration, replication depends on the size and aspect ratios of the structural 25 \nfeatures as well as the size of the area covered with such structures  and their density. The filling of the structures has \nto compete with the filling of the underlying thicker substrate [40]. This could be the explanation for why it was \nrecommended in the literature that injection moulded parts with high-aspect-ratio microstructures should have a \nthickness of at least 2 mm [62] so that a quick filling of the substrate can allow for filling the micro-cavities before \nsolidification starts. It was recently reported, however, that micro-structures of aspect ratios of 5 carried on a 1.5-mm- 30 \nthick disk substrate were successfully filled with poly lactic acid [64]. \n In addition, the effect of flow direction in either radial- and unidirectional injection was investigated in the literature \n[39], and it was shown that in unidirectional flow the depth of filling in microchannels is sensitive to the channel \nwidth, such that doubling the channel width from 200 \u00b5m to 400 \u00b5m causes  the filling depth to increase from 150 \u00b5m \nto approximately 600 \u00b5m. 35 \n The concept of the so-called time to pressure (TTP) was introduced by researchers [65] to explain the fact that the \ndegree of filling depends on the distance from the gate, which is the entrance of the polymer into the part cavity. Based \non experimental measurements of the pressure drop vs. the injection speed at sections with different thicknesses, it was \nsuggested that the shear stresses, and accordingly the pressure drop, required to fi ll the feature is in general much \nhigher than that to fill the substrate.  40 \n 7 \n \n Concerning achievable aspect ratios, it was suggested that there is a limitation regarding the achievable aspect ratio \n[3], which is a function of the geometry of the micro-features, its position on the sample, the polymer type and the \nprocess parameters. Thus, there is no simple rule to give the maximum aspect ratio which can be achieved in a \nparticular case.  Although it was not stated why these factors in particular affect the achievable aspect ratio, the \nexperimental work presented throughout this section gives examples of how geometry and processing factors affect the 5 \naspect ratio. \n With the recent developments in machine capabilities it has been reported that aspect ratios up to 20 can be filled \n[66,67]. Table 2 compares different experiments performed for different structural dimensions and materials. \nInformation reported in this table is subject to change as more developments are continuously achieved in machining \nand processing. In the context of table 2, it should be noted that the issue of dimensional tolerances is rarely addressed 10 \nin the literature. \n \n \n It has been suggested in the literature that the critical minimum dimensions which can be replicated successfully by \ninjection moulding are mainly determined by the aspect ratio. Although this has not  been presented in a rigorous 15 \nnumerical relation, experiments have shown that the sub-micrometer scale can be reached for aspect ratios less than 1, \nfor example in CD and DVD fabrication. Polymeric materials with minimum wall thickness of 10 \u00b5m, structural  \ndetails in the range of 0.2 \u00b5m, and surface roughness of about Rz < 0.05 \u00b5m have been manufactured [66]. \n A few attempts have been made to find the relation between part geometry and filling behaviour on the micro -scale \nby introducing standard micro-sized features for testing. As suggested in the literature [70], standard testing shapes can 20 \nbe helpful in comparing filling of structures with different wall thicknesses but the same aspect ratio. This will help in \ninvestigating the relation between wall thickness and flow path length and their limits. They can also be used for a \nwider range of polymers, since material properties affect flow behaviour. In both cases, using a statistical method (e.g. \nDesign of Experiments) will be useful in optimizing the experimental procedure. \n In one attempt [70] circle-shaped and wedged structures were used as testing shapes (Fig. 3) 25 \n \n \nFig. 3 Circular and wedged insert-shapes for testing [70] \n For the circle shapes, the wall thickness was varied in steps from 2.5 \u00b5m (inner c ircle) to 20 \u00b5m (outer circle) at a \nconstant height of 50 \u00b5m, whereas for wedges, the tip radii were varied from 0.5 \u00b5m to 5 \u00b5m. POM was the material 30 \nused for filling. The authors chose these two shapes based on earlier studies [71] in which different designs were \ncompared, and guidelines were deduced for designing standardized testing shapes.  \n For the circular shape, all the circles were filled completely, but the inner one (2.5 \u00b5m) was deformed during \ndemoulding. For the wedged shapes, the shape with radius 0.5 \u00b5m was partially filled, whereas larger radii were \ncompletely filled. 35 \nPolymer Abbr.

It was shown that square shapes were easier to completely fill \nwithout premature freezing than cylindrical shapes. 20 \n The authors also reported that features that are farthest from the centrally located gate fill more than those closer to \nthe gate. This is because the farther features have a lower thermal gradient and higher temperature that facilitates their \nfilling. This was verified by numerical simulation, which showed that the polymer tends to fill the relatively thick \nsubstrate before completely filling the features, so the farthest features usually contain the hottest material and require \nless pressure during the holding stage to fill than the features closest to the gate [64]. 25 \n The effect of geometric shape on demoulding quality has also been studied by comparing the quality of circular,  \nmeander, microfluidic and ray shapes (Fig. 5) [72]. The ray shape proved to be optimum for demoulding conditions \ndue to the shrinkage pattern it takes. \n  \nIII. Micro-Moulds & Inserts 30 \n3.1 Special features of moulds for micro-injection moulding \nMoulds made for micro-injection moulding of microfluidic parts are in principle similar to moulds made for \nconventional injection moulding. They usually consist of a fixed part and one or more moving parts, depending on the \ndesign. Finished parts are demoulded with ejector pins that are usually controlled hydraulically and electrically. \nHowever, moulds made for microinjection moulding have special features [27,40]. For example, moulds can be 35 \ncontrolled by the Variotherm process. This process permits heating rates of the  order of several tens of Kelvins per \nsecond, and hence imposes no significant change in the process time compared to conventional injection moulding. \nThe Variotherm process raises the mould temperature instantly above the polymer T g during injection to prevent early \nfreezing. During cooling, the mould temperature is decreased below the Tg to assist part solidification [27]. \n In addition to Variotherm, evacuation of the mould is done by air evacuation with evacuation rates that can reach 40 \nup to 25 m3\/h in some systems [73]. Air evacuation is used rather than air vents used in conventional injection \nmoulding. This is because the vents used in conventional injection moulding are larger in size than some of the cavity \nfeatures in micro-injection moulding, i.e. they will simply be clogged with polymer melt. In addition, micro-cavities \nmay form air pockets that cannot be released while the polymer is flowing in the mould, so the mould has to be \nevacuated just before injection [3]. 45 \n Due to the size of the mould cavity and features, adapted mould sensors are used, because conventional sensors are \nnot always suitable to micro-features. For example, pressure sensors with front diameters down to 1 mm and pressure \nrange up to 2000 bar are currently available for measuring cavity pressures in micro-injection moulding [74]. \n Special ejector\/withdrawal design is important, so that microfeatures are not deformed due to the induced friction \na b \nc d \n 9 \n \nbetween the mould and the part as discussed earlier in section 2.2.  \n3.2 Inserts for micro-injection moulding \nFor moulds used in micro-injection moulding, especially for microfluidic applications, micro-cavities are usually \nproduced on an insert, which is then fitted in the main mould body. While the mould is made of steel, as in \nconventional injection moulding, inserts can be manufactured of other materials, depending on the technology used. 5 \nThis is because hardened steel, which is the commonly used material for mould -making, requires specialised, and \nhence expensive, tools for machining micro-sized channels and features. \n The use of insert moulds also reduces the over-all cost of process set up where the finalised mould design is \nproduced by a number of iterative steps in which parts are moulded and the mould design is then changed.  \n 10 \n3.2.1 Special considerations about manufacturing inserts \n \nSome considerations are recommended for manufacturing\/processing inserts for micro -injection moulding [40]. An \ninsert should exhibit extremely smooth side walls to avoid friction during demoulding. Although suggested wall \nroughness have not been reported in the literature, the inner walls of the insert should be smooth enough to prevent 15 \nform-locking, i.e. the case where the part cannot be demoulded or the structures will be ripped or sheared off during \ndemoulding [61]. A small inclination angle, preferably greater than \u00bc\u00b0 [39], is also desirable, if this does no unduly \nimpact on the functionality of the microstructures to be moulded. \n In addition, the mould insert should ensure replication of the micro-features over many moulding cycles and \nwithstand lateral and normal forces during injection and demoulding. In practice this is achieved by choosing a 20 \nmaterial that is hard and ductile enough for the mould insert.  \n The surface properties of the mould affect demoulding during micro-injection moulding. The effect of surface \ntreatment has been investigated in the literature, where a tool coated with diamond-like carbon (DLC) was compared \nwith an uncoated identical tool [75]. Measurements of demoulding forces showed that surface treatment significantly \nreduces demoulding forces. 25 \n \n3.2.2 Manufacturing inserts for micro-injection moulding \n \nSeveral manufacturing techniques are used to produce inserts with micro-cavities. The choice of the technique depends \non the dimension\/geometry of the structure, the accuracy requirements and the fabrication costs. Manufacturing 30 \ntechniques include e-beam writing, lithography, electroforming processes (e.g. LIGA techniques, laser ablation) and \nprecision engineering techniques (e.g. micromilling and electro discharge machining (EDM)) [26]. Other advanced \nprocesses include laser machining, ion machining and ultrasonic machining [18]. \n Some complex moulds require the combination of different processes in a modular way by combining components \nmade by LIGA or laser ablation with components made by mechanical treatment [26]. 35 \n \n3.2.3 Capabilities of manufacturing methods \n \nSummaries of the capabilities of different manufacturing techniques are readily available in the literature [4,76]. \nSeveral comparison tables have been presented. For example, R\u00f6tting, et al, tabulated different processes in terms of 40 \nchoice of geometry, minimum feature size, height, total surface area, aspect ratio, life time, cost and availability [62]. \nHigh-speed cutting (HSC) milling, grinding, Erosion and UV-LIGA have been compared in terms of reproducibility, \nminimum roughness, minimum groove width, minimum step width and maximum aspect ratio [40]. An extensive \nevaluation of the common manufacturing techniques, such as electroplating, EDM and the developing processes, such \nas laser technology is available [40]. The capabilities of precision manufacturing methods in terms of their geometric 45 \nlimitations (2\u00bd D vs. 3D structures) have been compared [77]. \n \n3.2.4 Challenges facing mould and insert manufacturing \n \nIt has been pointed out that the wide range of technologies available makes it practically impossible for any small or 50 \nmedium enterprise to have all technologies in house. It is therefore required to solve the problem of the av ailability of \nmould inserts on an industrial scale which includes comparatively short delivery times, a reproducibility in the \nmanufacturing process and the guarantee of certain quality parameters of the mould insert [62]. \n Another challenge is the successful integration of pieces made with different insert-manufacturing technologies to \ncreate a micro-mould [18]. 55 \n In a recent study, hybrid tooling was presented, in which tools are manufactured with combination of micro -\nmachining techniques and tested by replication of several polymers. Comparison criteria were feature size, aspect \nratios and surface finish [78]. \n Concerning mould manufacturing, one of the main challenges is to modify the mould design to allow for more \ncomplex processes versions of the micro-injection moulding process. New mould designs have been tested to allow for 60 \n 10 \n \nmicro assembly injection moulding (\u03bcAIM), a process for combining two components in one process step [79-81]. The \nmould was designed such that the cavity holding the insert was interchangeable. This enabled some of the time -\nconsuming steps of the moulding process (i.e. demoulding the part, positioning the integrated elements inside the \ncavity, heating the cavity) to be done out of the process cycle, while the other cavity was being injected. Some of the \nprocess steps were automated, such as the cavity replacement process. This modification in the mould design enabled 5 \nthe process to produce micro-parts with joint-like movable components, fluidic hollow structures by lost-core \ntechnology and overmoulding of wires and optical fibres [82,83] \nSome recent studies have focused on the problems caused by using ejector pins for demoulding the parts. Other \nalternatives are under investigation such as vacuum or ultrasonic ejection [72]. \n 10 \nIV. Material Selection for Polymeric Microfluidic Devices \nSelecting the appropriate polymer to micro-inject microfluidic components is one of the most challenging tasks in \nprocess design for microfluidics, because several considerations have to be taken into account. These include the effect \nof polymer on achievable part tolerance, costs and the meeting of material property requirements. \n 15 \n4.1 Material requirements for microfluidics \n \nIn the case of parts with microfeatures, like microfluidic devices, material requirements have been discussed by several \nauthors in the literature [10,21,27,30,45]. For example, the material should possess appropriate mechanical properties. \nAlthough microfluidic devices are not usually subject to severe mechanical stresses, mechanical properties could be of 20 \ninterest if the chip is to be stacked with other units or integrated within a larger cell. Thermal properties are also \nimportant, especially when the microfluidic device is subject to elevated temperatures while in service. In order to \navoid softening of the device, and subsequent deformation in features, glass transition temperature Tg, melt \ntemperature Tm and thermal expansion coefficient will be critical. In addition, the ability of the polymer to dissipate \nheat is important in order to avoid local high temperatures in the device when it is subject to high temperature s while 25 \nin service. In addition to thermal properties, chemical resistance to certain solvents or strong acids can be required if \nchemical reactions are taking place in the microchannels. Chemical resistances of several micro-mouldable polymers \nto different chemical substances have been compared [30]. The authors adopted a qualitative poor-to-excellent scale in \ncomparing the polymers.  \n During the processing of the polymer, dimensional stability and accuracy are key properties for microfluidic 30 \npolymers. They include, for example, reproducibility, tendency to shrinkage and warpage, as presented previously in \nsection 2. \n If electrical connections are integrated with the microfluidic device, additional attention should be paid to the \nelectrical properties of the polymer. It should possess good insulating properties, such that currents are allowed to pass \nonly through the microfluidic substance moving in the channels.  35 \n Biological applications require the polymer to be biocompatible, and permeability could also be  demanded if living \ncells are involved. \n In addition to the previous conditions, optical properties might be significant if optical monitoring is involved. \nAmorphous polymers are usually used in such cases.  For optical properties, charts comparing five common polymers \n(PMMA, COC, PC, MABS, SBS) in terms of transmittance and replication quality have been produced [47]. 40 \nTransmittance was compared by the value of transmission percentage at a wavelength of 590 nm, whereas replication \nquality was compared by the depth of filling in nm. \n Special microfluidic applications like micro-pumps require additional properties for the polymer. Such properties \ninclude hardness, surface charge, molecular adsorption and electro-osmotic flow mobility. \n  45 \n4.2 Material requirements for manufacturability \n \nMicro-injection moulding is a process that involves severe operation conditions in terms of temperatures (up to few \nhundred degrees) and pressures (up to tens of mega-Pascals). In addition, being a viscoelastic material, polymeric \nmelts experience shear-thinning, i.e. a decrease in viscosity with increase in shear rate. Thus, radical changes in the 50 \nmaterial properties are expected due to high shear-rates resulting from flow in to micro cavities. Therefore, the \npolymer selected should be appropriate for micro-injection moulding. Generally speaking, all standard thermoplastic \nmaterials suitable for conventional injection moulding can be used for micro-injection moulding [9], provided that \nsome manufacturability conditions are met [28,42,84,85]. For example, the polymer should possess low viscosity and \nhence good flow properties. Therefore, most of the materials used today in micro -injection moulding are low-viscosity 55 \nformulations of standard polymers. \n High mechanical strength is also recommended in order for the moulded part to resist mechanical stresses \nassociated with demoulding friction or ejector forces. This is especially important for high -aspect-ratio structures, \nwhere a larger surface of contact between the mould and the polymer imposes higher frictional resistance while \n 11 \n \ndemoulding. Thus, small structures are often torn off at high-aspect ratios [42,86]. \n The polymer should be compatible with the mould material, as during processing, polymers may have different \neffects on the mould material. Also the material should not leave deposits in the mould. For example nickel mould \ninserts are not affected by moulding PC even after 10,000 moulding cycles [28]. On the other hands, it has been \nreported in the literature that polymers containing aggressive chemicals can lead to corrosion in the inserts. This 5 \ncauses rough mould surfaces leading to aggressive demoulding and damage to structural details in the sub -micrometer \nrange [28]. No list of specifically aggressive chemicals was available in the literature covered in this review. \n Taking into consideration the radical temperature changes in the Variotherm process, it is recommended that the \npolymer has a narrow temperature interval between free-flowing and solidification. Rapid solidification is thus \nrequired. 10 \n When it comes to the pellet size, The polymer pellets should be of size small enough to fit within the flights of the \nsmaller conveying screws generally required for micromoulding, to ensure proper melting of the polymer [87]. (This \nissue of developments in pellet size is further discussed in section 4.4.2.). In addition, if the polymer is filled, the size \nof the filler particles should be less than the size of the minimum microstructure; otherwise reproducibility will be \naffected.  15 \n4.3 Polymeric materials used in micro-injection moulding \nA number of authors have reported on the mouldability of particular engineering plastics. Table 3 summarises \npolymers that have been reported as mouldable by the micro-injection moulding process.  Most of the known \nengineering plastics appear on this list. \n Among the listed materials, some have been specifically recommended for medical applications, because they 20 \ncomply with the approval criteria of the European regulatory agencies, such as POM, PPS, PBT and LCP [86]. \n In addition to the listed materials, thermoplastic elastomers, such as polyurethanes, were recently reported to be \ninjection mouldable with high-aspect-ratio features [88]. \n \n4.4 Comparing the performance of polymers in micro-injection moulding 25 \nGenerally speaking, selecting the right polymeric material for micro-injection moulding microfluidic devices is an \nissue that is still under investigation. The available reported data have been collected through experiments done under \ndifferent processing conditions with different types of machines and microfluidic feature designs. Thus, it will be of \nClass Polymer Full name References \nA\nm\no\nrp\nh\no\nu\ns \nPMMA (Acrylic) Polymethylmethacrylate [9,27,28,30,37,42,47,69,72,89,90] \nPC Polycarbonate [9,10,19,22,24,28,30,37,42,47,72,89-92] \nPSU Polysulfon [9,10,28,42,89] \nPS Polystyrene [9,19,37,42,93] \nCOC Cyclic Olefin Copolymer [10,19,33,42,47,90,91] \nCOP Cyclic Olefin Polymer [94] \nPPE (PPO) Polyphenylene Oxide [9,10,26,42] \nPEI Polyetherimide [9,10,26,42] \nPAI Polyamide imide [10,42] \nMABS Methylmethacrylate Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene [47] \nSAN Styrene Acrylonitrile [94] \nSBS Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene [47] \nABS Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene [92,95,95] \nS\nem\nicry\nstallin\ne \nLCP Liquid Crystal Polymer [9,10,42,87] \nPP Polypropylene [9,42,67,92,95,96] \nPE Polyethylene [9,19,20,42,69] \nPOM (Acetal) Polyoxymethylene  [9,10,19,26-28,42,67,68,70,72,84,89,95] \nPOM-C Polyoxymethylene (Carbon-filled) [28] \nPBT (Polyester) Polybutylene Terephthalate     [9,10,19,26,42] \nPBT-HI Polybutylene Terephthalate (filled with 15% glass fibre) [10] \nPA 6 (Nylon) Polyamide 6 [42] \nPA 12 Polyamide 12 [9,10,28,89] \nPA 12 -C Polyamide 12 (Carbon-filled) [28] \nPVDF Polyvinylidene Fluoride [28,89] \nPFA (Teflon) Perfluoroalkoxy [89] \nPEEK Polyetheretherketone [9,10,26,28,42,87] \nPLA (Polyester) Polylactic Acid (Polylactide) [64] \nTable 3 Polymers for micro-injection moulding \n 12 \n \ngreat benefit to set a standard method by which polymer materials can be compared objectively for  micro-injection \nmoulding. \n Several comparisons of the performance of different polymers in micro-injection moulding are now available in the \nliterature. For example, commonly available polymers have been compared in terms of structure quality, filling \nproperties and demoulding [28]. In this case, the authors adopted a qualitative approach in comparison, which was 5 \ndependent on experience rather than reported measurements. Other authors have reported that the choice of materials \ncan affect the quality of the produced parts in terms of dimensional stability, shrinkage, warpage and filling high \naspect-ratios. For example, Weber, et al, tested six polymers for the manufacture of micro-sized features [26]. The \nexperiments indicated that PBT and PEEK gave the best results for filling small V-grooves. This was represented in \ncomplete filling of the mould insert, minimum radius of curvature at the edges, and homogenous surface profile. With 10 \nrespect to shrinkage, LCP experienced the minimum percentage shrinkage of approximately 0.5%, whereas POM \nshowed maximum percentage shrinkage of approximately 2%. \n It has been reported [42] that the best filling results for micro-injection moulding were obtained with POM, PA and \nPBT for semicrystalline materials, and PC and PMMA for amorphous polymers. Numerical measurements, however, \nwere not been reported by the authors. 15 \n In another filling experiment, it has been noted that PP and HDPE showed unusual flow behaviour in filling high -\naspect-ratio structures. For PP, SEM micrographs of structures of aspect ratio 6 showed spherical or nipple-shaped \nprotrusions on the flow fronts. For HDPE, the moulded micro-walls were tilted, and the surfaces at the base of the \nmicro-walls were cambered [48]. \n Changing the processing parameters can affect the performance of the material. For example, one experiment has 20 \nshown that changing the melt-zone temperature Tm, affects POM, but it does not affect other materials such as PP and \nABS, from which it was deduced that some materials are more sensitive to temperature than others [67]. \n4.5 Ongoing developments in materials for micro-injection moulding \n4.5.1 Developing new materials \n 25 \nThe demand for developing special materials tailored for micro-injection moulding is increasing. However, although \nmany developments have been achieved in micromoulding in terms of machine and processing capabilities, \ndevelopment of special polymers is lagging behind. The main reason for this is the small size of the part, which causes \nthe demand for the material to be relatively low. If the size of a single part is between 0.001g and 1g, neglecting the \nweight of the sprue tree, the production of a million parts requires, at the most, 1 ton of starting material [27]. Under 30 \nsuch low-material-demand conditions, it is sometimes difficult to find a supplier who is ready to deliver such small \namounts of special polymers [28]. \n When parts with micro-structures are produced in larger quantities, the demand for special materials will increase. \nMaterial suppliers may find it more feasible to develop new materials when market consumption reaches several \nhundred tonnes per year [42,84]. 35 \n \n4.5.2 Filled polymers for microfluidics \n \nFillers can enhance polymer properties in terms of, for example, mechanical properties, thermal properties and \nelectrical properties. Filled polymers are currently being tested for micro-injection moulding of microfluidic 40 \napplications. Carbon-filled POM and PA 12 have already being tested for microfluidics in addition to glass -fibre-filled \nPBT [28]. It is important that the filler size is smaller than the micro-structures of the part in order to maintain accurate \nreproducibility. New filler concepts are based on small-dimensioned fillers that provide the micro structure with high \nstiffness and strength while maintaining adequate reproduction fidelity compared with unfilled polymers [42]. \n Another developing area within the use of fillers is the introduction of nano-filled polymers. Filling polymers with 45 \nnanoclay particles, for example, is a promising area in research, and the nano-composite market is expected to grow to \nover 25% a year to reach $250 million in 2008 [97]. Polymer nano-fillers, such as nanotalcs, carbon nanotubes and \ngraphite platelets, are currently used to enhance properties of polymeric materials in appl ications such as food-\npackaging, automotive and electronics, where nano-fillers are currently used to enhance material properties including \nlighter weight, added durability, dimensional stability, better temperature resistance, enhanced surface finish and 50 \nsurface aesthetics and easier processing [97]. The amount of improvement achieved is dependent on the application \nand the nano-filler used. It was not possible within the available literature covered in this review to find details as to \nhow nano-fillers can enhance the properties of micromoulded microfluidic devices. \n \n4.5.3 Two-component micro-injection moulding and hybrid microstructures for microfluidics 55 \n \nMulti-component micro-injection moulding is a developing method allowing for the possibility of connecting different \nmaterials within one part, thus combining different material properties. Possibilities include connecting \nconductive\/insulating, hard\/soft or magnetic\/nonmagnetic combinations. For example, it has been reported in the \nliterature [98] that it was possible to micro-injection mould insulating macro-structures over a conductive substrate. 60 \n 13 \n \nThe part was then coated with a metal layer by electroforming, and the two-component thermoplastic part was \nseparated afterwards. \n Another research group introduced the process of micro assembly injection moulding (\u03bcAIM), which combines \ndifferent materials by overmoulding. A set of articles was published detailing the methodology of this process in terms \nof the different materials combined, the investigation of the bonding strength and the potential applications for such a 5 \ntechnology [79-83]. \n \nV. Micro-Injection Moulding Machines \n5.1 Introduction \n Micro-features have always been a challenge for injection machines, because of the requirement to completely fill 10 \ncavities in the micro-range before the material starts to solidify. This is specifically critical for microfluidic devices \nwhere there is a large change in thickness between the substrate and the microfeatures. In fact, this challenge appeared \nbefore the spread of micro-injection mounding, when the same problem was to be solved for thin-wall injection \nmoulding. At this stage it was required to completely fill 2-D thin-walled geometries before the frozen layers begin to \nblock the cavity. Such thin-walled parts were used in producing laptops and mobile phones. Conventional machines 15 \nwere able to overcome this problem by changing certain parameters such as injection pressure and speed [99]. \nIncreasing the injection pressure forces the material to flow into the thin  cavities when its resistance to flow increases \ndue to premature freezing. This technique can, however, result in high stresses and sink marks in the part. Increasing \nthe injection speed enhances the filling process because it decreases the viscosity of th e polymer melt due to the shear-\nthinning effect associated with viscoelastic materials [99]. 20 \n The same approach was adopted to allow conventional injection machines to produce 3 -D micro-sized parts. \nMachines used for producing CDs proved to be qualified for producing low-aspect-ratio structures [99]. In addition, \ninjection moulders produced large, but precise, sprues to achieve the necessary shot weights, because the minimum \nshot weights were larger than the part size [100]. \n Structures with higher aspect ratios required further modifications [69]: 25 \n1. Applying vacuum to ventilate the mould. \n2. Increasing the mould temperature to the melt temperature of the polymer to avoid premature freezing.  \n3. Correctly timing the switchover between the injection pressure and holding pressure, so that the holding pressure is \napplied to compensate for part shrinkage before the materials is frozen. \n Nevertheless, modifications in the machine design proved to be necessary, especially after the increase in market 30 \ndemand for products with microfeatures of complex design, higher aspect ratios (larger than 2) and sub -micron \nprecision [26].  \n5.2 Modifications made for micro-injection moulding machines \nBased on the set of problems discussed in the previous section, several technical modifications were necessary to \nmanufacture injection machines capable of producing micro-parts: 35 \n5.2.1 Smaller injection (plastification) unit \nIn order to decrease the residence time to prevent material degradation, a smaller plastification unit was introd uced to \nprovide a shot size of 5 cc or less. Because the most efficient operating range of most injection units is 20% to 80% of \nthe allowable stroke, a typical injection unit size would be 30 cc or smaller [101]. \n Decreasing the size of the plastification unit requires the reduction of the screw size and also changes in its design 40 \nparameters, such as residence time, length to diameter ratio (L\/D ratio), root diameter, and compression ratio. Strength \nis the primary limitation to screw diameter, because the screw should withstand the torque required to convey the solid \nmaterial through the transition zone. In addition, the standard pellet size imposes limits on the screw flight size. In \nmicro-injection moulding, typical injection unit diameters are 14 and 18 mm with L\/D ratios of 15 to 18. \n In addition, decreasing the screw size makes it important to increase the linear injection speed in order to maintain 45 \nthe same filling rate. A target linear speed is larger than 200 mm\/s for a screw diameter of 18 mm or les s to achieve a \nfill time less than 0.2 seconds [101]. \n5.2.2 Lower tonnage \nInjection moulding of small parts usually requires less projected area, which is the area of the mould surface occupied \nby the part cavity. Therefore a clamping unit with lower tonnage was required [102]. Both mechanical toggle systems 50 \nand hydraulic clamp mechanisms are suitable for micro-injection moulding. The former system is less complicated, \nwhere as the latter is more accurate for small shot sizes [101]. \n5.2.3 Advanced control system \nAn accurate control system was necessary to meter smaller shot sizes. The accuracy depends on the control system \nresponse time and the resolution of the positional indicator [101]. In addition, accurate parameter-control is required 55 \n 14 \n \nfor better reproducibility [10], especially in the changeover from injection to holding pressure [27]. \n5.2.4 Variotherm system (temperature variation program) [26] \nIn this system the mould is heated up to nearly the melt temperature, and when the mould is completely filled , it is \ncooled down rapidly using additional cooling lines inside the tool [10,23]. This system is a basic requirement to \ndecrease the cycle time for producing microfluidic parts with structural dimensions of several tens to several hundreds 5 \nof micrometers, from aspect ratios of three to five, or extreme precision requirements of 1 \u00b5m [84]. \n The use of a rapid thermal process (RTP) has been investigated, in which the surface is heated with IR radiation \nusing a high power halogen lamp [90]. \n5.2.5 Air evacuation \nIn order to avoid air vents that have sizes similar to some microstructures, the mould cavity has to be evacuated using 10 \nan external evacuation system [23,26]. \n5.2.6 Handling and inspection \nThis should be integrated into the machine system for correct positioned removal of the part [27]. In addition, a \nrobotized vacuum-suction system was integrated in some machines to demould the part, handle it and quality-inspect it \nagainst a video camera [19]. 15 \n \n Several additional enhancements have been introduced to micro-injection machines, including turning-tables to \noptimize the cycle time. A clean-room environmental cell is sometimes added to create a controlled working \nenvironment. A detailed description of machine developments is provided in the literature [103]. \n Future enhancements for micro-injection moulding focuses on decreasing the sprue size and developing 20 \nplastification units suitable for providing small amounts of melt using, for example, ultrasonic energy [104,105]. \n \n It should be noted that microfluidic devices can still be produced using conventional injection machines, provided \nthat the optimum operational conditions are selected. In fact, several of the reported experiments used in this review \nare performed with conventional machines [48,51,106,107]. Conventional machines are usually used when a large-area 25 \nmould is required. This is particularly important for the production of microfluidic devices with relatively large \nsubstrates, or where mass-production demands multi-cavity design. As mentioned in section 5.1, using conventional \nmachines to produce microfluidic devices would require processing principles similar to those used for thin-wall \nmoulding, such as increased injection pressure, increased melt temperature or high injection speed. Optimizing these \nparameters results in a decreased melt viscosity that allows the polymer to fill relatively thin -walled, large-area 30 \ncavities. Another option would be to implement Variothermal process for the mould by locally heating specific areas \nof the mould and maintaining the mould temperature above the Tg of the polymer during the injection process. \n \n In the recent years there has been a trend towards the development of electric-hydraulic hybrid type machines or all-\nelectrical machines [108]. It was reported in 2004 that all-electric machines hold a 75% share of the Japanese market 35 \nand 30% of the US market [109]. Electric machines use servomotors to drive processes, such as injection, clamping \nand plasticating. The main advantages of electric machines vs. hydraulic machines are higher precision, clean \nenvironment without hydraulic oil, etc., low noise-level and energy efficiency [108-111]. A comparison between a \nnumber of injection moulding machines was reported in the literature. Four machines, two of which were e lectric, were \ncompared in terms of performance factors, including process variation and energy consumption [111]. It was shown 40 \nthat electric machines are more reliable, in that they exhibit less variation over a number of process measurements, \nwhich was reflected in better repeatability. In addition, it was shown that hydraulic machines consume more power \nthat electric machines by a factor of 3.6. On the other hand, electric machines are more expensive relative to hydraulic \nmachines [109,111]. \n5.3 Micro-injection machine manufacturers 45 \nSeveral manufacturers began to produce injection machines tailored specifically for micro-parts. An example for this \nwas a partnership project that was introduced to produce machines with specifications suitable for micro -injection \nmoulding, including their design, styling and manufacture, as well as handling, testing and assembly [14]. The \nAustrian project group involved Battenfeld Kunststoffmaschinen GmbH, of Kottingbrunn, HB-Plastic GmbH, of \nKorneuburg, Inocon Technologie, of Attnang Puchheim and Zumtobel Staff GmbH of Dornbirn. In 1985 Battenfeld 50 \npresented an injection unit for micro-parts with weights of 0.5 to 4 g: the Micromelt unit. With other partners, it could \nproduce a unit capable of producing weights down to 0.1 g know as the Microsystem 50 [14]. Another example is the \ncooperation project between the Institute for Plastics Processing (IKV) at Aachen University of Technology (RWTH) \nand Ferromatik Milacron Maschinenbau GmbH in Germany. They were able to produce a plasti fication unit with a shot \nweight of 0.1 to 1 g [100]. A detailed description of the Milacron machine is in the literature [102]. 55 \n Comparison between different machine types available in the market and their capabilities are available in several \nreferences [4,84,112]. \n 15 \n \nVI. Optimization of Process Parameters \nCommon processing parameters usually include melt temperature, mould temperature, injection speed, injection \npressure, holding pressure, injection profile controlled either by speed or pressure and cooling time, in addition to the \npossibility of changing the material type. The part quality can be measured in terms of complete filling, dimension \nstability, mechanical properties or any other parameter depending on the product.  5 \n6.1 Early experiments \nIn initial studies made to investigate process-parameter effects, the main method was by changing one parameter at a \ntime and observing its effect on the part quality. This method was useful for injection moulders in making some basic \nconclusions about the role of each parameter by its own. \n For example, low mould temperatures offer a short cycle time, but can cause premature freezing [69]. Thus, the 10 \ninjection rates have to be high enough to allow for complete filling before freezing. In addition, because of the \nviscoelasticity of polymeric melts, high temperatures allow for complete penetration without the need for high speeds. \nThus, it was deduced that injection speed and melt temperature at various stages within the process are the most \nimportant parameters of the injection process. \n In another experiment [22] the parts did not completely fill, except when the mould was heated up to a temperature 15 \nabove the Tg of the polymer, which illustrates that the mould temperature affected the filling depth of the polymer. \nThis relation between the mould temperature and the filling depth was also shown in another experiment [20] where an \nattempt was made to overcome the hesitation effect caused by the viscoelastic nature of the polymer melt, which was \npreventing the filling of high-aspect-ratio cavities. It was concluded that the ideal situation will be reached when \nhaving a hot mould during injection stage and a cold mould during the cooling stage. This concept has been adopted by 20 \nseveral machine manufacturers in the form of a Variotherm system. \n The effect of holding pressure was also investigated [21]. Birefringence was used to evaluate the effect of process \nparameters on the residual stresses in the moulded parts. Holding pressure was shown to provide better replication by \neliminating material shrinkage, but at the expense of residual stresses. Recent experiments showed that mould \ntemperature significantly improves optical properties of microstructured PC parts [113]. 25 \n6.2 Design of Experiments (DoE) approach \nThe studies previously cited show that several parameters can affect the part quality. In fact, the interaction of more \nthan one parameter may affect both the filling behaviour and the part quality. However, testing of all the possible \ncombinations of the different parameters is not practical in terms of time and resources. Therefore, it was required to \nfind a statistical method that has the capability of accounting for the interaction between different parameters and at 30 \nthe same time optimizing the experimental work so that only the important parameters were investigated. Hence, the \nDesign of Experiment approach has become widely used in experiment assessments of micro -injection moulding. \n Table 4 compares a number of designed experiments conducted by different research groups. The experiments \npresented indicate that many parameters can play a role in the part quality either independently or interactively.  The \ntable also shows that the main results of each set of experiments are different. This indicates that that the part qua lity is 35 \nnot only a factor of processing parameters. Other factors play a significant role such as the material used (rheological \nbehaviour), the geometry of the mould, the selected response (quality parameter) and the surface finish of the mould. It \nis therefore advisable to run a designed experiment to optimize the process whenever an element is changed, such as \nthe mould geometry or the polymeric material. Further study and investigation is required in this area.  \n6.3 In process monitoring of process parameters 40 \nMultiple-sensors and data-acquisition systems have been used to monitor the change in processing parameters during \nthe different stages of injection moulding. It was reported in a series of articles that several additional sensors could be \nused to monitor the change in, for example, injection pressure, cavity pressure, displacements and velocity of the \ninjection pin, temperature in both halves of the mould and the injection force [16,114,115].  \n In addition, in-process rheometry has been used to monitor the change in the strain rates during processing [86].  45 \n Ultrasonic probes are currently used to evaluate the part quality in terms of filling incompletion, polymer \ndegradation and melt flow speed [116,117]. \n6.4 Summary \nFrom the previous discussion, it can be deduced that determining the most effective process parameters for micro -\ninjection moulding is a topic that needs further investigation. Although several experiments have been done, even with 50 \nthe same type of machine, results are often different. This could be because studies were carried out under different \nexperimental conditions (e.g. different polymers or test part structures were used) [95].  \n There is, however, a general agreement in the literature that the mould temperature should exceed the n o-flow \ntemperature of the polymer, but the most influential processing parameters are still a subject of debate.  \n This emphasises the idea that part quality is a factor of different parameters interacting with each other. Processing 55 \nconditions, materials used, geometrical shapes and even the machine type are all significant in determining the quality \n 16 \n \nof the final product. In addition, the most significant parameters can vary depending on which output parameter is \nchosen for evaluating the part quality. Output parameter may include, for example, a specific dimension, a weight or a \ntolerance. How these parameters interact together is an issue that needs further research.  \n It seems that the DoE approach is the most suitable strategy to deal with the considerabl e amount of variables \navailable. However, the experiments need to be well planned, so that only the significant properties are identified 5 \nwithout affecting the resolution of the results.  \n Running a DoE requires a mould to have been designed and built, such that it is ready for running the experiments. \nThis is one limitation of the method, because the results obtained for specific geometrical shape are not necessarily \nvalid for another shape. Thus, for design of moulds for microfluidic parts, it would be of  great help if a simulation \npackage were to be available, where it was possible to simulate the effect of changing processing parameters on the 10 \nquality of parts of different geometrical designs. With the existence of such a package, it would also be possib le to \ninvestigate post-ejection properties such as residual stresses, warpage, etc. \n \n \nVII. Modelling and Numerical Simulation 15 \n \n This section illustrates the areas in which numerical simulation can be useful in micromoulding of microfluidic devices, \nand it points out the simulation requirements specific to micro-scale processing. Some simulation experiments are also \npresented, in addition to the potential areas for improvement. \n 20 \n7.1 Applications of numerical simulation \n \n The ability to numerically simulate micro-injection moulding would allow for the following major goals to be achieved \n[98,125,126]: \nTested factors Response Materials Main results Ref. \nMelt temp., injection pressure, holding \npressure, injection speed and mould \ntemp. \nFilling quality of \nmicro-featured \nchannels \nPC, SBS, \nMABS, COC \nand PMMA \nMelt temp. and mould temp. are most \nsignificant parameters. \n[47] \nInjection time, injection pressure, \ninjection temp. and mould temp. \n3D numerical \nsimulation of part \nfilling. \nPS, PC and \nPMMA \nThe mould temp. is the most important \nparameter.

To visualize the flow and predict the last-filled sections of the mould. This is usually done by the short-shots method, \nwhere the mould is filled with different amounts of the material to see how the flow proceeds during injection. This is \nuseful to identify defects that are usually associated with the last filled parts like incomplete filling, weld lines and \nvoids. \n2. To economically optimize the design of the mould. Because it usually expensive to manufacture injection-moulding 5 \nmoulds, it would be very useful to simulate different geometrical designs, sprue and gating systems, flow-paths to \ndetermine the optimum mould design before manufacturing. \n3. To simulate the thermal conditions of the flow during filling and cooling which would be useful in estimating the cycle \ntime and determine the processing bottlenecks. \n4. To assist designed experiments in determining the most influential processing parameters on the part quality. 10 \n5. To identify post-processing properties, such as residual stresses, shrinkages and warpage. \n \n7.2 Special considerations for simulating micro-injection moulding \n \n Simulating injection moulding has always been a challenge even at the macro-scale processes. This is because many 15 \nvariables are involved in the process and also because of the non-Newtonian nature of polymers. Micro-injection moulding \nposes an extra challenge for simulation programs, because different physical concepts are involved on the micro-scale, which \nmakes it unfeasible to scale down macro-physics simulations [87]. \n Several factors affect the accuracy of modelling micro-injection moulding, which include [125,127]: \n1. In conventional injection moulding, two-dimensional modelling is common, which neglects the effect of side and end 20 \nsurfaces. This is not accurate for micro-injection moulding because three-dimensional modelling becomes significant. This \nis because on the micro-scale it is not possible to approximate the flow shape to flow between two parallel plates. Thus, the \nHele-Shaw approximation, which has been used several times to simulate micro-injection moulding, is not suitable for \nsimulating micromoulding conditions such as fountain-flow and transverse pressure gradients. In addition, this \napproximation simplifies the modelling near corners, bifurcations and changes in the part thickness. 25 \n2. Some effects that are neglected in conventional injection moulding become significant in the micro-scale due to the \nincreased surface-to-volume ratio, such as surface roughness, surface tension, heating of the melt by viscous friction and \ncooling of the melt front due to increased heat loss. In addition, models should account for the differences in dynamics of \nheat and mass transfer in the micro-scale. The heat transfer coefficient, for example, was shown to be significant on the \nmicro-scale [107]. 30 \n3. The viscoelastic nature of the polymeric melt becomes more significant at the micro scale because of the high shear rates \ninvolved in, for example, narrow gates. It has been mentioned in the literature that increasing the shear rate decreases the \nmelt viscosity to values that are different from those that may be specified in data sheets. Experiments showed that \nreducing the gate sizes from 0.1651 mm to 0.0381 mm can decrease some physical properties by 5% to 7% [87]. \n4. Meshing elements should be chosen with particular care, because two-dimensional elements conventionally used on 35 \nmacro-scale, for example shell elements, give over-predicted filling. \n5. Special processing conditions, such as the Variotherm processes, or evacuating the mould prior to filling, should be \nconsidered in modelling. \n \n7.3 Examples of simulation experiments 40 \n \n Several attempts have been made to simulate micro-injection moulding using a variety of packages for different purposes. \n One of the earliest attempts[127] was undertaken using I-DEAS Master Series\u2122 Thermoplastic Moulding version 1.3c to \noptimize the design of the mould, runner and gates, to define and optimize the process parameters and to predict problems \nassociated with warpage and shrinkage during cooling. It was noticed that on the micro-scale, an increase in the significance 45 \nof some factors appears which affects the accuracy of the software predictions. One factor, for example, is the large surface-\nto-volume ratios of micro parts, which make surface phenomena dominate the filling and cooling behaviour [127]. The Helle-\nShaw approximation was used with shell elements. The simulation over-predicted the length of the short-shots. This was \nprobably because of the two dimensional simplification of the geometry. In which all the surface effects were calculated only \nfor the top and bottom of the mid-surface of the mesh element, whereas side and end effects were ignored. 50 \n In another experiment [39] 2-D simulation software C-MOLD ver. 2000 (Moldflow Corp.) was used to determine the \nmost influential processing conditions. It was concluded that the injection speed, feature width and mould temperature were \nimportant for mould filling. \n ABAQUS has been used to simulate the temperature distribution in the tool during the different steps of the cycle [66]. \nThe filling was simulated by Moldflow. It was observed that it was possible to predict qualitative properties such as welding 55 \nlines, but numerical values of filled volume, for example, could not be simulated as precisely as required [128]. It was \nproposed that the packages designed for macroscopic applications could not be relied for micro-scale processes, and it was \npointed out that the development of software tools specifically tailored to micro-applications is one of the main future tasks. \n 18 \n \n The use of software such as C-MOLD to analyse the effect of different gate geometries and locations on the final part has \nbeen discussed. In the particular geometrical shape simulated, changing the size and position of the gate in addition to \nchanging the material eliminated the knit line and flow hesitation [85]. \n Complex shapes and high-aspect-ratio micro-features have also been simulated. \n C-MOLD 2000 was used to simulate the filling of micro-gears [44]. A 2-D mid-plane mesh structure was applied to 5 \nrepresent a 3-D melt flow. The simulation was in agreement with the experimental design showing that the teeth of the gear \nwere the last parts to be filled \n The effect of micro-scale phenomena on micro-injection moulding has been investigated [77]. These phenomena include \nsize-dependent viscosity (i.e. the change in the fluid viscosity from the wall to the middle of the flow stream in \nmicrochannels), wall slip (i.e. the tendency of polymeric melts to slip over solid walls during flow in microchannels when the 10 \nshear stress becomes higher than a critical value) and surface tension. Simulation was used to identify the most influential \nparameters in micro-injection moulding [118]. The Navier-Stokes equations were used for modelling the flow of PS, PC and \nPMMA, and the simulation showed that the mould temperature was the most effective parameter on part quality. A finite \nelement code with a 3D solution approach was used [64] to simulate the filling of different shapes relative to their positions \nto the gate, and it was shown that the features far from the gate experienced more complete filling, because the material far 15 \nfrom the gate required a smaller pressure drop in order to fill the features.  \nSeveral other simulation experiments were also reported in the literature [107,129-134]. \n \n7.4 Ongoing developments \n 20 \n As mentioned in section 7.3, it has been shown by different researchers that commercial simulation programs for \nconventional injection moulding have drawbacks when used in simulating micro-injection moulding. Some packages over-\npredict the filling of the cavity. Other packages give acceptable qualitative simulation results, but fail to give reliable \nquantitative values [46,91,98,125,126]. Therefore, two approaches are currently followed: \n The first approach is to develop finite-element codes specifically for simulating micro-injection moulding, instead of 25 \nusing commercial packages. Attempts are made to add the special modifications associated with scaling down the physics \nfrom the macro-scale. For example, a finite element code was used to simulate three-dimensional non-Newtonian non-\nisothermal flow in micro-injection moulding. This was achieved by solving the momentum, mass and energy equations [125]. \nThe second approach is to try and develop the currently available packages, so that they can simulate micro-injection \nmoulding. An example of this is a combined project [135] in which a code was written that enables Moldflow system to 30 \naccurately simulate the last place to fill in a micromoulded part. This replaces the method of using progressively short-shots \nof a real micro part in a real micromould. \n \nVIII. Post-Ejection Processes for Microfluidic Parts \nIt is normally desired to obtain the final product with the least number of processing steps in order to limit  time and 35 \nerror sources. Microfluidic devices, however, usually need extra processes before they are ready for use. Such \nprocesses may include, but are not limited to, sealing, coating, drilling holes and connecting inlets and outlets, \ndepending on the application. Other logistic problems are also relevant to post-ejection processes, such as handling and \ninspection. Literature about these processes is currently scarce, either because such processes are still being researched \nor because they exist as in-house knowledge of commercial companies. 40 \n8.1 Handling the ejected parts \nGiven that the produced part can be very small in size, special care is required when handling, especially if other \nprocesses are still in line. Part handling is challenging given the sizes of micromoulded components. Micromoulders \nuse different handling techniques depending on the product. Many micromoulders use edge-gated runners to carry \nparts from one location to another, and such runners are used as part of the automation process. In o ther cases 45 \ncustomized end of arm tooling, vacuum systems, reel-to-reel take-up equipment and blister packs are used [18]. \n8.2 Inspection and metrology \nThe technique for evaluating the quality of the part varies depending on the parts\u201f application. The qual ity parameter \nfor microfluidic applications can be, for example, the micro-channel width, the tolerances or the filled aspect-ratio. \nInspection can take place as a part of the process by using, for example, an in-line video camera. 50 \n However, in-line quality control may not be enough for some purposes, such as surface finish or material \nmorphology within the component [16,136], and in this case further inspection has to be done with specialized \nequipment. Inspection techniques in measuring small micromoulded parts require customized vices, tweezers, and \nfixturing [112]. Moreover, there is limited availability of inspection equipment that is capable of measuring to sub-\nmicron tolerances [18], and therefore most of the time functional tests were performed. 55 \n Quality assurance with regard to specific processing issues may require the use of specialized equipment. An \nexample of this is the use of a laser profilometer to check warpage by measuring deviation in the flat surface of the \n 19 \n \npart [26]. A 3D-measurement for the geometric dimensions of the part can be made by using a confocal microscope \nwith suitable image-processing software [62]. In addition, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has been used for surface \ninspection and characterization, and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for observing 3-D details and evaluating \ndimensions [16,136,137]. Although SEM is a standard imaging technique, it is not the best method for measurement of \nthree-dimensional features. Contact-probe methods, such as micro-coordinate measurement machines (\u03bc-CMM) have 5 \nbeen commercially developed for three-dimensional dimensional metrology. \n8.3 Measurement of mechanical properties \nDue to the small sizes involved, conventional mechanical testing techniques such as tension and bending tests cannot \nbe readily applied to micro-features of micro-fluidic parts. Nano-indentation can be used to investigate the mechanical \nproperties such as the modulus of elasticity. For example, the relation between the processing conditions, the level of 10 \ncrystallization of the micromoulded part and the modulus measured has been investigated and reported in a set of \narticles [16,115,136,138,139]. \n8.4 Sealing the device \nIt is important to be able to seal the microfluidic device so that leakage is prevented. Different technique s are being \ndeveloped to find applicable sealing techniques. Adhesives, different variants of welding or lamination are some 15 \nexamples 102. MILDENDO GmbH introduced a method that does not involve a third material, which is useful for \nbiocompatible applications [62]. \n Although sealing polymers is challenging, it is much easier than sealing silicon or glass to other substrates [30], \nbecause most polymers have Tgs between 120 and 180\u00b0C, so relatively low-temperature annealing could be used for \nassembly. Using the same technique for glass or quartz, the temperature would be raised to  approximately 600\u00b0C [57]. 20 \nA polymer with a lower Tg can be used to ensure that there is no deformation in the micro-channels during sealing \nprocess. Elastomeric polymers such as PDMS have excellent adhesion to a wide variety of substrate materials and can \nbe used to enclose micro-channels with a non-permanent seal. In cases where permanent sealing is required, it can be \nperformed by plasma oxidation of PDMS surfaces. \n Different sealing techniques were tested for biological microfluidic devices [140]. For example, thermal diffusion 25 \nbonding (TDB) results in low strength and moderate distortion, when the device is bonded below T g. In this case TDB \nat or very near Tg results in increased bond strength but excessive deformation. Another example is solvent-assisted \nbonding, which allows low distortion, high strength bonding at low temperatures and pressures.  \n An economical approach to the sealing problem would be to find a method by which mic ro-injection moulding and \nsealing can take place in the same process. A method has been introduced in which it is possible to inject the 30 \nmicrofluidic circuit and cover it at the same process, which is known as in -line covering. It was done by mounting both \nthe microfluidic-substrate mould and the lid mould on a rotating table. After moulding the substrate it is not ejected, \nbut the table rotates such that the lid is moulded and held at the fixed part of the mould. Finally, the table rotates again \nbringing the substrate opposite to the lid, and they are pressed together using temperature and ejected as one single \npart [40]. 35 \n Most of the sealing techniques mentioned in the literature are associated with specific cases. The choice of the \noptimum sealing technique is therefore dependent on the application. Several questions have to be considered when \nattempting to seal a polymer microfluidic device: \n- Is it possible to bond the lid to the substrate without using a third material?  Examples include thermal-diffusion \nbonding [38,140-144], laser welding [5,145], ultrasonic welding [146] and mechanical clamping [106,147,148]. 40 \n- If a layer of a bonding material is to be used, how would this affect the cross-sectional area of the micro-channel? \nWould excess bonding material flow into the micro-channel areas? \n- If heating is involved in bonding, would this distort the micro-features on the substrate or affect the mechanical \nproperties of the polymer chip? \n- Is the bonding technique only applicable for joining two parts of the same polymeric material, or is it possible to use 45 \nit with different polymers or a polymer and another material? \n- Is the bond strength high enough to resist the pressure caused by injecting microfluids in the channels?  \n- Is the bonding material, if any, compatible with the microfluids biologically and chemically? \n- Can the existence of bonding material affect the flow of the microfluid (for example by surface tension)?  \n- If bonding requires the use of solvents, are they compatible with the polymer of th e device? 50 \n- Will the bonding interfere with other \u201cadd-ons\u201d, for example electrodes? \n These are examples of questions that can pose a challenge in finding the right bonding technique. The answers will \ndepend on the product itself and its technical requirements. Some sealing techniques for polymeric microfluidic \ndevices are reviewed in the literature [145,149]. \n8.5 Additional processes 55 \nAdditional post-ejection processes are sometimes required, which, in addition to inspection and sealing, are known as \nback-end processing. For example, holes can be used to connect the part to a macro -sized substrate, or they can be \nused as reservoirs. They can be drilled mechanically or by laser ablation, but problems may appear due to the \n 20 \n \nformation of burrs by the drilling process, which prevents the bonding between the moulded part and the other piece. \nIn addition to hole formation, dicing of individual devices out of a wafer can be done easily and quickly using, for \nexample, a CO2-laser. Mechanical sawing can also be used, but it is slower and may restrict the possible design. In \nsome cases, additional activation of the polymer surface or deposition of biologically active molecules on the polymer -\nsurface might be needed [40]. 5 \n \nIX. Outlook for the micro-injection moulding of microfluidic devices \nSignificant developments have been recently combined to make micro-injection moulding a stable high-volume \nprocess for manufacturing disposable microfluidic devices. Several problems have been successfully overcome by \nimprovements made to the process or to the equipment. Micro-injection moulding is currently used for commercial 10 \nmicrofluidic applications. However, challenges remain which require further investigation and research, and for many \nof these challenges very little information is available in the literature. This is because most of the current research \nactivities are driven by the needs of new products or specific applications, and, furthermore, some of the achievements \nobtained are not published for commercial reasons. \n 15 \nDesign and geometry \n \nConcerning the microfluidic circuit design and geometry, it was not possible from the covered literature to identify a \nstandardized approach for designing a microfluidic circuit to be manufactured by micro -injection moulding. Most of \nthe design aspects discussed in the literature are concerned with individual problems, such as gate -placing or 20 \n\u201chesitation-effect\u201d problems, or concerned with specific products. \n General design recommendations used in conventional injection moulding can be useful i n micro-injection \nmoulding, such as uniform part thicknesses, gate and runner positioning, cooling system distribution and ejection \npoints. In addition, the effect of shrinkage on part demoulding and shape stability becomes significant with higher \naspect ratios. 25 \n Special design recommendations need to be identified for microfluidic circuits, such as the minimum channel \ndimensions, maximum aspect ratios, spacing between channels, surface roughness, flow direction and position of the \nejection points. \n A broader challenge would be to set standards for designing integrated microfluidic circuits, which more than one \nfunction is integrated into the chip. This will involve significant changes in the process to take account of the 30 \ninsert\/capsulation technique. \n Techniques for modifying the surface properties of polymeric microfluidic devices are not well -established as the \ncase in glass. Special techniques for improving the surface properties of micro-featured polymer surfaces need to be \ninvestigated. \n Micro-injection moulding of truly 3D components is an open topic for research. Most microfluidic devices 35 \ncurrently produced by micro-injection moulding are limited to 2\u00bd D structures. This limits the design options of the \nsystem, and necessitates the use of post processing assembly. \n \nMoulds and Inserts \n 40 \nDevelopments in precision engineering have allowed for several techniques to produce microfeatures. Laser ablation, \nLIGA and micro-machining are few examples of commonly used methods \n Insert fabrication techniques have different limitations in terms of achievable minimum dimensions, fabrication \ntime, economical feasibility, dimensional accuracy or finishing quality. It may be required to integrate several \nfabrication techniques, i.e. hybrid tooling, in order to overcome the limitations of each individual process. This 45 \nrequires choosing a suitable insert material and a cost-effective fabrication procedure. \n Changing the mould design enables micro-injection moulding to produce more complex products. Micro-assembly \ninjection moulding is an example for a process that can be used for integrating elements into the plastic chip. A proper \nmould design is required to allow for the assembly process to take place without significantly affecting the total cycle \ntime. 50 \n \nMaterial selection \n \nGenerally speaking, most of the commonly known engineering plastics are already used in micro -injection moulding. \nThermoplastic elastomers have also been used. Some challenges still exist with respect to polymer selection. Designed 55 \nexperiments show that a single polymer can have different filling quality for different part shapes or aspect ratios. In \naddition, for a specific geometrical shape, using different polymers results in different part qualities in terms of filling \nand shrinkage. This interaction between the type of polymer moulded and the quality of the part produced makes it a \nchallenging task to determine a specific material for a certain application without testing it under different conditions. \n 21 \n \nTrial and error is usually the standard method used to select the optimum material. \n No standardized methodology has been adopted to test the behaviour of different materials with respect to certain \ncommon microfluidic geometries, such as channels or reservoirs for example. Filled polymeric materials hav e not been \nwidely tested for micro-injection moulding. Nano-clay particles, carbon nanotubes or metallic fillers may be of use to \nenhance specific properties in the microfluidic circuit. Considering the high shear rates involved in micro -injection 5 \nmoulding, problems such as particle distribution or migration in micro-moulded filled polymers should also be \ninvestigated. \n \nMoulding Machines \n 10 \nMoulding Machines have been greatly developed during the past few years, and several manufacturers are currently \noffering machines for industrial-scale production. Screw-over-plunger design, small plastification units, advanced \ncontrol, the Variotherm system and clean-room environments are some of the enhancements made specifically for \nmicro-injection moulding. A major challenge would be the successful integration of additional elements to the \nmicrofluidic chip. This would allow the commercial use of microfluidic devices to cover more complex structures and 15 \napplications. \n \nProcess parameters \n \nSeveral experiments and approaches have been adapted to determine the most influential processing parameters, but 20 \nthe results are sometimes in conflict. There is common agreement that heating the mould temperature above the T g of \nthe material enhances the product quality considerably. \n The interactions between the processing parameters, material properties and part geometry are still largely to be \ninvestigated. The Design of Experiment (DoE) approach seems to be the most appropriate strategy to investigate such \ncomplex interactions. Nevertheless, being a statistical method, the accuracy of the results depends on the number of 25 \nruns allowed and the tolerance ranges specified. In addition, a DoE is normally performed for certain circuit designs. \nHence, the results obtained might not be applicable for other designs because of the change in, for example, surface \nproperties or shear rates induced in the mould. \n \nPost-Ejection processes 30 \n \nThe function of the microfluidic device determines the number and type of post -ejection processes required before the \ndevice is ready for use. Some processes are common among most of the devices such as quality inspection, testing \nspecific properties and sealing. Special processes may be needed such as drilling holes or metallization.  \n Sealing of microfluidic circuits is a factor of different interacting parameters. Preventing leakage and ensuring 35 \ncompatibility of the lid and seal with the material and the micro-fluid are some of the challenges that are subject to \nresearch. Integrating the sealing process within a mass-manufacturing process would be a major development in \nmicrofluidic manufacturing. \n \nIntegrated microfluidic devices 40 \n \nIntegrating different components by micro-injection moulding is a potential area for development. Integrating external \nfunctional elements within a mass-production process like micro-injection moulding would allow for many complex \nmicrofluidic prototypes to be realized on a commercial scale. Two component micro-injection moulding is a \ndeveloping field, and having it as an established process requires changing the design of the mould and machine 45 \nparameters to allow for an automated process for series production. In addition, micro-assembly injection moulding is \na promising technology for producing hybrid microstructures. Movable parts, hollow structures and overmoulded \nfibres are currently being developed. The technology has not yet been applied for microfluidic applications as far as \nthe literature covered in this review is concerned, which makes it an open area for further investigation.  A number of \nintegrated microfluidic devices were produced by mass-manufacturing techniques, such as micro-injection moulding 50 \nand hot-embossing, but this discussion is beyond the scope of this paper.  \n \nX. Conclusion \n \nThis review intended to present the state-of-the-art technology of micro-injection moulding for microfluidic devices 55 \nand to present potential developments and research gaps. The recent decade has witnessed major developments in the \ntechnology that made it one of the most preferred high-volume techniques for fabricating microfluidics. The \ntechnology offers several advantages in terms of mass-manufacturability, variety of materials and accurate replication \nof micro-scaled features, and it is currently being used commercially for producing some types of microfluidic \nsystems. Further technologies are being developed to allow for precise heating and metering of polymer for better 60 \ncontrol of the process. \n 22 \n \n A number of limitations, however, need to be overcome before the wide-scale fabrication of microfluidic devices \ncan be realized by micro-injection moulding. The nature of end-shape processes puts limitations on the allowed \ngeometrical designs to ensure smooth demouldability. In addition, polymers in general have limitations in terms of \noperation temperature and electrical properties that prevents them from replacing glass or silicon in specific \napplications. The optimization of the process parameters, especially for high aspect ratios, is essential for parts with 5 \nacceptable quality. Finally, taking into consideration the complexity of integrated microfluidic systems, especially for \napplications like bio-MEMS, it is important to develop in-line integration techniques to allow the mass-fabrication of \npolymeric microfluidic devices that are economically feasible for commercial use. \n \n 10 \n \n 23 \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Becker H.
