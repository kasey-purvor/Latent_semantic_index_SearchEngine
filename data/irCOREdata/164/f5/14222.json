The paper concludes with a discussion of the issues which arise from this work.\nForeword\nThis article is dedicated to David Squires and aims, along with the other articles in this\nissue, to celebrate David's research work and his substantial contribution to learning\ntechnology research. On a personal note, I knew David for a relatively short period of time\nbut he had a significant influence on my own career; in particular he acted as a valuable\nsounding-board at a stage when I was making major career-changing decisions. He had a\nrelaxed and easy-going approach, was always willing to work collaboratively with others\nand had a genuine enthusiasm for learning technology research. His support and\nfriendship were much appreciated and he is very much missed.\nIntroduction\nIn his paper 'Peripatetic electronic teachers in higher education', Squires explored the idea\nof Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) providing a medium to enable\nhigher education teachers to act as virtual freelance agents (Squires, 1999). In this futuristic\n4\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nvision, peripatetic electronic teachers (PETs) existed as multiple telepresences (pedagogical,\nprofessional, managerial and commercial) in PET-worlds: global networked environments\nwhich supported advanced multimedia features. Squires opens by stating that most people\nagree that the role of teachers will change with the advent of ICT. The article explores the\npossibility that ICT could break exclusive links between educators and a single institution.\nSquires states:\nJust as future learners may be seen as clients contracting to receive educational provision\nfrom a range of providers, educators may be seen as independent workers offering their\nservices to learners on demand. These educators will not be confined to the classroom,\nrather they will be electronic workers providing a virtual presence in public spaces, the\nworkplace and the home. A new type of peripatetic electronic teacher (PET) will emerge.\nThis article provides an overview of learning technologies and considers the extent to\nwhich this vision has been achieved.\nA review of pedagogic developments in this area has already been undertaken (Thorpe,\n2002), charting the shift from focusing on individuals to the social context of learning.\nThorpe concentrated on the effects of changes in practice which have arisen as the use of\nICT has become more widespread. She maps the changes to relevant pedagogical theories,\nin particular drawing on the notion of communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1990)\nand the shift from independent to collaborative learning. This article is complementary to\nThorpe's review, concentrating on the following aspects:\n\u2022 the impact of national and international policy agendas and drivers;\n\u2022 an outline and categorization of key funded technological and related development\nprogrammes (focusing particularly on those in the UK);\n\u2022 an overview of some of the resultant issues;\n\u2022 a synthesis of key emergent themes.\nBackground\nOver the past decade a considerable wealth of digital resources and Information and\nCommunication Technology (ICT) tools have been developed to support learning and\nteaching. These have been funded from a variety of sources such as the National Science\nFoundation (NSF) and the Sloane Foundation in the States, and the Joint Information\nSystems Committee (JISC) and the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) in the UK. These\nresearch and development programmes have allowed academics to experiment with the use\nof new technologies and integrate digital resources with more traditional teaching\nmethods. This has raised a host of pedagogical and technical issues, such as:\n\u2022 How effective are these new approaches?\n\u2022 What are the underpinning technical, managerial and infrastructural requirements?\n\u2022 What protocols and standards are needed to ensure interoperability?\n\u2022 How do we deal with issues such as copyright and the rise in plagiarism?\nThis article aims to provide an overview of these activities and some of the emergent\n5\nGrainne Conole The evolving landscape of learning technology\nthemes and focuses primarily on higher education; Guile and Hayton have published a\nreview of the impact of ICT in further education, summarizing key implications (Guile\nand Hayton, 1999).\nA considerable body of research has been carried out on the development and use of\nlearning technologies. The literature on the area has been expanding exponentially in the\nlast five years, including the emergence of a range of specialized journals (such as ALT-J,\nEducation, Technology and Society, the Journal of Interactive Multimedia Education, the\nAsynchronous Learning Network Journal, and more recently Educational, Information and\nCommunication) and a series of notable summaries for the area (Bates, 1995; Hiltz, 1995;\nMason, 1998; Collis and Moonen, 2001; Laurillard, 2001). In parallel specialized\nconferences have arisen (such as ALT-C, ASCILITE, EdMedia, ICALT, ICCE, Ideas in\nCyberspace Education, and the Networked Learning conference, to name but a few).\nFinally there are a number of useful introductory guides to the area (Forsyth, 1996;\nBarnett, Brunne et al, 1997; Seale and Rius-Riu, 2001).\nThere is a growing trend towards taking stock of what has been achieved. Squires et al.\nhave collated a representative sample of articles published in ALT-J over the last decade\n(Squires, Conole et al, 2000). Lockwood and Gooley have co-edited a collection of essays\non successful developments in online and Web-based learning (Lockwood and Gooley,\n2001). In addition several books have focused on networked learning, including two\nexcellent overviews of its foundations and theoretical perspectives (McConnell, 2000;\nSteeples and Jones, 2002). There have been several recent reviews of the area. Williams\nreviewed the literature on learning online, concentrating on the problems involved in\ntransferring courses online (Williams, Lock, Crisp and Longstaffe, 1995; Williams, 2000;\nWilliams, 2002), whilst Bonk provides a survey of the use of ICT in teaching in the states\n(Bonk, 2001). An analysis and mapping of ICT developments to underpinning learning\ntheories have been carried out independently by Ravenscroft and Thorpe (Ravenscroft,\n2002; Thorpe, 2002).\nSince no article could adequately cover the breadth and scope of this area, this article instead\naims to provide a snapshot of recent and ongoing activities and provide some coherent\ncategorization of these. It will begin by focusing on the context in which this work arises.\nThe wider context - drivers and initiatives\nNational strategies and policies for the higher education sector and, in particular, the role\nof information and communication technology (ICT) to support learning and research, sit\nwithin a context of rapid technological change (Conole, 2001). This provides immense\nopportunities, whilst at the same time making firm commitment to specific systems or\ndevelopments very difficult. Over the past decade, there is evidence that this area is\nmaturing; it is becoming integrated into the core business of institutions and is being\nconsidered as part of a wider, more generic learning and teaching debate.\nAs might be expected, the technical research aspects become dated very quickly. In\ncontrast the organizational and pedagogical issues remain pertinent and a number of\ncommon themes emerge. One of the most influential policy reports, addressing many of\nthese issues, was the Dealing report (NCIHE, 1997). This was the culmination of the\nsystematic review of higher education, and included at least fifteen recommendations\n6\nALT-] Volume 10 Number 3\nwhich make explicit reference to ICT. These have significantly influenced the focus and\ndirection of many ICT projects in the last five years, as was evident from a recent in-depth\nanalysis of the teaching and learning projects of the JlSC-funded JTAP programme\n(Conole, 2002). Similar effects have arisen from the FE sector (Kennedy, 1998); other\nnotable reports include the Fryer report (NAGCELL, 1997), the Booth report (Booth,\n1998), and associated papers on lifelong learning (DfEE, 1998).\nThe Dearing report has had a significant influence over the focus and direction of many of\nthe funding programmes and initiatives. Several strategic factors have been of particular\nimportance in the last five years. The first is that the Higher Education Funding Council\nfor England (HEFCE) now requires all higher education institutions to have a clear and\ndemonstrable learning and teaching strategy as a condition of funding; closely related to\nthis are institutional Information Strategies and more recently Human Resource Strategies.\nTaken together, these strategies are an attempt to ensure the use of ICT is appropriately\nembedded into the institution (McNaught and Kennedy, 2000). Secondly, one of the most\nprominent features of the impact of ICT on teaching and learning is the way in which ICT\nhas acted as a catalyst for opening the debate on learning and teaching issues more\ngenerally (Littlejohn and Cameron, 1999). Furthermore, the scaling-up of ICT use has had\na profound influence on the infrastructure of institutions, raising debates about staff and\nstudent training needs, the integration of strategies and future planning (the JISC has\nfunded a range of projects which have addressed these issues and also explored the associ-\nated sociocultural issues, in particular see www.jisc.ac.uk\/mle). This has now begun to\nmature as most institutions move towards developing institution-wide managed learning\nenvironments.\nThe above indicates that ICT is moving from being associated with peripheral innovations\nand developments to affecting all aspects of learning and teaching, although currently this\nis probably more true at the strategic than at the operational level. It is clear that the 'ICT-\ndebate' can no longer be addressed in isolation, but must be considered' across all\ninstitutional and national strategies and policies. The latter point has profound\nimplications on funding mechanisms and national initiatives.\nInitiatives over the past decade reflect these trends. There has been an increased focus on\nICT in HEFCE and JISC calls, but also in research-focused programmes through the\nEPSRC and ESRC. In addition, the National Grid for Learning (NGfL) and the\nUniversity for Industry (Ufl) have sought to increase the base-level of ICT skills within the\ncommunity and provide a solid technological infrastructure for education from primary\nthrough to tertiary level. The shift towards embedding ICT is well illustrated by the\nTeaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP), where the last phase of funding\nfor the programme clearly shifted from development of materials to their integration\n(HEFCE 1997). Within JISC calls, there has been a greater focus on 'joined-up' techno-\nlogies and the provision of a solid technical infrastructure with a critical mass of materials\nthrough the development of an Information Environment (IE) of resources, tools and\ninitiatives focusing on the development of managed learning environments.\nTechnological developments are not the only influence on higher education; the sector has\nalso been changed by developments such as the government's widening participation\nagenda and the consequential expansion of student numbers, the collaborative\n7\nGra\/nne Conole The evolving landscape of learning technology\nopportunities and potential threats of increasing globalization, the impact of increased\nmonitoring and quality assurance processes, the increased drive towards professional-\nization and accreditation, the changing nature and expectations of the student population\nand the rise of the 'Nintendo generation' of computer-literate students (Morice, 2000).\nOverview of current ICT developments\nThis section provides a broad overview of areas of current interest in the UK. It is a\nsynthesis of a number of recent research studies, reviews and evaluations (Bull, Conole et\nal, 2002; Conole and Bull, 2002; Conole, Smith and Franklin, 2002).\nLearning technology taxonomies\nLearning technology is an inherently multidisciplinary field involving researchers from a\nwide range of backgrounds (educational research, cognitive psychology, instructional\ndesign, computer science, and so on) as well as teaching subject-experts who engage with it\nas 'end users' or 'consumers'. This multi-disciplinarity is a common feature of emergent\nresearch areas, but makes the task of providing an overview of the key research activities\ndifficult. This diversity also makes the task of creating a definitive taxonomy, for learning\ntechnologies difficult. This section highlights some of the alternative classification systems\nthat have been developed.\nBeetham has suggested that ICT can be classified in three main ways: as a tool, as a\nresource, or as a medium for communication (Beetham, 2001). These can range from\nsimple office tools through specialized databases and applications, to subject-specific tools\n(chemical molecule drawing packages or CAD software for engineers). Tools can be used\nto produce a range of digital resources ranging from simple documents through animated\npresentations to complex modelling tools. Finally ICT can be used as a communication\nmechanism (asynchronous and synchronous). Examples of the former include email and\ndiscussion boards where the interaction does not occur in real time. In contrast, examples\nof synchronous communication includes live chat groups and video conferencing. ICT\ntools can be combined in a variety of ways to meet specific purposes and functions, or for\nuse within a specific context.\nAlternatively, ICT can be classified by research and development activities (Conole 2002),\nusing the following categories:\n\u2022 the development and use of digital resources, tools and software;\n\u2022 the development of supporting infrastructure, underpinning standards and protocols;\n\u2022 research into related pedagogical and sociocultural issues (the use and uptake of ICT);\n\u2022 the development of learning environments to support learning, teaching, research and\nadministration.\nFinally a taxonomy can be used which illustrates the breadth of the area spanning the\ndevelopment and use of specific technologies (such as video conferencing), underpinning\ntechnologies such as networking and infrastructural issues, holistic and integrative environ-\nments such as virtual learning environments (VLEs) and managed learning environments\n(MLEs), as well as associated 'softer' issues such as impact on organizational change and\nassociated staff development needs (Conole, 2002). Classification then includes:\n8\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\n\u2022 experimentation and reporting on novel uses of ICT;\n\u2022 review of technologies;\n\u2022 evaluation of the use of ICT in teaching and learning;\n\u2022 development of resources and tools;\n\u2022 exploration of associated issues;\n\u2022 synthesis of key findings and production of good practice guidelines, support tools and\ntoolkits, and templates;\n\u2022 methodological issues about the use and impact of evaluation;\n\u2022 critiques on the broader socio-cultural issues;\n\u2022 evaluation of the use of communication technologies;\n\u2022 evaluation of the use of virtual learning environments;\n\u2022 multimedia and adaptive interactive environments.\nIn terms of simplicity the remainder of this section will outline some key developments\nunder the following broad categories which cut across each of the taxonomies described\nabove. Some of the features described in the above lists have been omitted as they have\nalready been covered by Thorpe (2002).\nThis paper focuses on:\n\u2022 learning environments - focusing on VLEs and MLEs;\n\u2022 digital libraries, gateways and portals;\n\u2022 resources and tools for learning;\n\u2022 underpinning architecture and standards development;\n\u2022 associated research and impact (changing practice and professional identities;\naccessibility, IPR, copyright and plagiarism; organizational change; and strategic and\npolicy issues).\nLearning environments\nThe development of robust technical infrastructures for institutions has become a major\narea of activity in the last five years. These learning environments include enclosed virtual\nlearning environments (VLEs) as well as more encompassing managed learning\nenvironments (MLEs) which attempt to join up VLEs with institutional administrative\nsystems.\nVLEs are systems that integrate communication tools (email, discussion boards, and so on)\nwith learning resources and assessment tools. There is a host of activities that VLEs are\npurported to support, such as, 'encouraging active learning', 'shifting from didactic to\nfacilitative teaching' or 'building online communities' (Britain and Liber, 1999; Armitage,\nBrown et al, 2001). The reality is more complex, involving the context within which these\nsystems are used and how well they are adapted to specific student needs. Making a\ndiscussion board available on a course will not automatically create a motivated virtual\n9\nGrdinne Conole The evolving landscape of learning technology\ncommunity of collaborating students with a benevolent smiling 'tutor on the side'.\nTherefore although VLEs can be used to significant effect for the delivery of materials, for\nsupporting learning and as a management tool, this is not an inherent property of the\ntechnologies themselves.\nVLEs have three main applications: (i) to support learning and teaching, (ii) as an\nadministrative tool, and (iii) for storing information. VLEs can be used to support learning\nand teaching; through discussion boards to encourage debate, by extending face-to-face\ncontact, through pre- and post- workshop topics, peer support groups, live chats around\ntopical issues, or access to subject experts. Administratively, communication functions\ninclude the use of 'virtual notice boards', pre- and post-meeting agendas, minutes and\npapers, the setting up of tailored email groups and mailing lists and the use of discussion\nboards for debates on meetings or issues. Management functionality includes the setting up\nof staff and student details, collaborative document writing, monitoring\/tracking the use\nof resources, and as a staff development tool to explore the potential of the online\nenvironment and ways of sharing expertise. Information management includes the\ndevelopment of shared virtual filing cabinets, mechanisms for storing materials, shared\nrepositories of course information (syllabi, timetables, diaries), and so on. Knowledge\nmanagement applications include staff expertise databases, course templates, shared\nresources, questionbanks, FAQs, bookmarks and reference repositories. One of the key\nproperties of VLEs is the fact that they have the potential to provide a holistic all-\nencompassing platform for supporting both teaching and learning and the associated\nadministration and management.\nRecent interest has shifted to thinking about how these functions can be 'joined up' with\nother university management systems, such as student records and personnel data. A\nmanaged learning environment (MLE) will include administrative information about\ncourses, resources, support and guidance, collaborative information, assessment and\nfeedback - essentially linking up to back-end office systems and databases. JISC is\ncurrently undertaking a large programme of work on the development of managed\nlearning environments (JISC, 2000). One of the key advantages of an MLE is the ability to\nhave common authentication between VLEs and other systems such as email and also\nenable transfer of results from VLEs or online assessment systems to the MIS.\nDigital libraries, gateways and portals\nThe second major area of development is specialized information gateways. These are\nincreasingly important because of the need to tailor information for specific audiences\n(Currier, Brown et al, 2002). A number of niche information gateways have developed. In\nthe UK the main gateway for higher education is the Resource Discovery Network\n(www.rdttac.uk); similar gateways exist in Europe and elsewhere (Renardus, 2001). The\nterm 'gateway' is used to describe a range of Internet sites that in some way provide access\nto other, predominantly Internet-accessible, resources. Gateways are intended to facilitate\nresource discovery by their target audience, to help their users find what they need via the\nInternet. 'Information gateway' is a generic term that refers to a whole range of Web-based\nresource guides pointing to Internet information resources, whereas 'subject gateways' are\nsubject-based instances of these (Renardus, 2001). Resource description and subject\nclassifications are the most important characteristics of such guides. In addition, it is be-\ncoming more common for publishers to make journals, books, data archives and\n10\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\ncollections available online. Considerable thought is being given to how users can access\nand use these resources in a coherent way; a good example of this is a recent definition of a\nportal architecture by Powell. In his paper, he defines a subject portal as something that\n' \"brokers\" end-user access to a range of services, relevant to a particular subject area, over\na number of application protocols (LDAPP, Whois++, Z39.50, ILL, FTP) [and] . . .\nprovides \"discover\", \"locate\", \"request\" and embedded \"use\" . . . functionality' (Powell,\n2000). Powell goes on to describe the architecture for a portal. He defines six types of\n'player'; the end-user, presenters, coordinators, mediators, communicators and providers,\nand describes the roles and relationship between them. At the 'bottom' of the architecture\nare the information providers, such as subject gateways, data archives, service providers\nand collections. Clearly, these systems represent a rich variety of structures, supporting a\nrange of applications.\nIt is also evident that the boundaries between VLEs for learning and portals for research\nare blurring and that many of these systems are starting to provide additional functionality\nbeyond their original scope. For example, the social science research gateway, SOSIG,\nprimarily focuses on the development of a quality-assured set of resources of relevance to\nthe social science research community. However it also includes a facility to develop\npersonal profiles, 'My SOSIG', and to network with 'likeminds' using its grapevine facility.\nSOSIG is also linked closely to a set of online tutorials which provide an introduction to\nthe Internet (Virtual Training Suite, available online at http:llwww.vts.rdn.ac.uk). Similarly\nVLEs are often now used as gateways or portals to specific types of resources of relevance\nto a particular learning programme. These developments suggest that evolution is in\nprocess, namely that an information source, once established, starts to adapt according to\nuser needs.\nResources and tools for learning\nThere has been significant investment in the development of resources and tools for\nlearning in the last five years. JISC and the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) have funded a\nnumber of large-scale programmes to enable the development of resources for learning and\nteaching. Some examples are described here. The development of computer-aided learning\nmaterials to support learning and teaching is nothing new, but perhaps began to accelerate\nwith the emergence of easy-to-use authoring tools (such as Authorware and ToolBook) that\ndid not require extensive programme skills. And during the late 1980s and early 1990s the\nTeaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP) produced a range of courseware\nresources, using these kinds of tools. A more recent example of a resource of this type is\nthe highly successful Virtual Training Suite which is a set of over 50 tutorials which provide\na clear subject-specific introduction to the Internet. Subject areas span FE and HE and\ninclude subjects as diverse as 'Internet for chemists' and 'Internet for hairdressers'. The\nguides sit alongside the relevant subject gateway within the Resource Discovery Network\n(Place, Conole et al, 2000a; Place, Conole et al, 2000b).\nA second area of significant activity has been the development of models, simulations and\nvirtual worlds to support subject disciplines. For example the Virtual Economy is a model\nof the UK economy which very closely mirrors the real model used by the Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer. Students can change a range of variables and study the impact at micro-\nand macro-economic levels. The model is linked to a variety of resources and teaching\nguides and is part of the larger Biz\/ed business gateway and portal. Other projects have\nGrainne Conole The evolving landscape of learning technology\nattempted to simulate practical teaching such as the development of Virtual Laboratories\nand Virtual Fieldtrips, see for example http:\/\/www.ch.icac.uk\/vchemlab\/ and\nhttp:\/\/www.geog. le. ac uklvfcl.\nIn terms of assessment there have been two main areas of focus: the development of\nassessment tools for authoring, the creation of subject-specific question banks and the\ndelivery of tests. An example of the former is the CASTLE toolkit which is an online\nauthoring tool that allows course tutors and managers quickly to create interactive quizzes\nfor use on the web (http:\/\/www.Ie.acuk\/castle\/). The creation of question banks has been of\nparticular interest in the science and engineering subject domains. An FDTL-funded\nproject e3an is developing a network of expertise in assessment issues within electrical and\nelectronic engineering. A major focus of this project is the development of a test bank of\npeer-reviewed questions for diagnostic, formative and summative assessment (White,\nDickens et al, 2002). The Technologies for Online Interoperable Assessment (TOIA)\nproject is developing administrative procedures and Question and Test Interoperability\n(QTI)-based systems and databases to facilitate and promote the uptake of online\nassessment across the sector (TOIA, 2002).\nVideo conferencing has developed significantly in the last decade and most higher\neducation institutions now have one or more central video conferencing systems in place.\nThese are most commonly used for administrative and research meetings, but they are also\nused in institutions with multiple sites or where programmes are delivered across more than\none institution. Scotland has been at the forefront of these developments. The MANs\ninitiative and Talisman project encourage the use of the ATM video conference suites\navailable at all Scottish HEIs, see www.umi.ac.uk for further details. An important example\nof the use of video conferencing for staff development is a seminar series where institu-\ntions across Scotland link into monthly video conference discussions and lectures (SESDL,\n2002). However desktop video conferencing systems are not yet so commonplace, perhaps\nbecause they are still perceived as being unreliable.\nThe rapid growth of multimedia and visualization technologies has led to the exploration\nof the increased use of images and different visual representations of data (Conole, Evans\net al., forthcoming). There are a number of trends emerging in terms of the use of images.\nFirstly, traditional disciplines are using the technologies to create remote classrooms and\nlaboratories. Secondly, library and archive services are finding new ways of storing,\nindexing and making material available. Furthermore, the ability to create, collect, store\nand retrieve images and multimedia objects of all types will be central to the successful\nexploitation of ICT in the future.\nUnderpinning architecture and standards developments\nThere has been considerable work on the development of networking technologies,\nspecifications and associated standards. Much of this is being orchestrated internationally\nthrough the IEEE (www.ieee.org). The standards that underpin the use of networks to\ndeliver educational content include: transport protocols, text, images, sound and moving\nimages, 3-D environments, metadata and rights management. In some areas standards are\nrelatively mature, whilst others are still being contested. One of the most important aspects\nof this work with respect to learning technologies and education is the development of a\nstandard for Learning Object Metadata (LOM). The standard aims to specify the syntax\n12\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nand semantics of Learning Object Metadata (LTSC, 2001). Learning objects are defined as\nany entity, digital or non-digital, which can be used, reused or referenced during tech-\nnology-supported learning (Littlejohn, forthcoming). Examples of technology-supported\nlearning include computer-based training systems, interactive learning environments,\nintelligent computer-aided instruction systems, distance-learning systems, and col-\nlaborative learning environments. Examples of learning objects include multimedia\ncontent, instructional content, learning objectives, instructional software and software\ntools, and persons, organizations or events referenced during technology-supported\nlearning. The Learning Object Metadata standards focus on the minimal set of attributes\nneeded to allow these learning objects to be managed, located and evaluated. However\nwork in this area is still been contested; in particular, claims such as 'where applicable,\nLearning Object Metadata may also include pedagogical attributes such as teaching or\ninteraction style, grade level, mastery level, and prerequisites' (Littlejohn, forthcoming) is\nhighly contentious.\nDiscussion\nAs outlined above, ICT research covers a broad spectrum of activities ranging from a focus\non particular technologies or their application to associated organizational, cultural or\ninfrastructural issues. It is evident, however, that there are a number of cross-themes\ninvolved in differing degrees: the software and hardware requirements, human resource\nand skills issues, and associated cultural and organizational aspects. The software research\ntends to focus on the development and application of new forms of software to support\nlearning and teaching. Hardware research is primarily concerned with the development of\na robust technical infrastructure to support this; but also investigation of the nature and\npotential role of peripheral devices and their use. A large area of research in this area is\ninterested in the investigation of the human resource implications of increased use of ICT\nand in particular associated staff and student needs and skills and the type of training,\nsupport and development they will need to achieve maximum benefit out of the\ntechnologies. Research is also exploring the associated attitudes and perceptions of\ndifferent key stakeholders and the resultant issues of organizational change. Other organ-\nizational issues include evaluation of the impact on infrastructure and the integration\nwithin existing practices. This links closely to institutional strategic and policy debates and\nthe impact on and effects of relevant strategy and policy and the influence of national level\nagendas and drivers.\nA consistent issue across many ICT-developments is sustainability, including who should\nmaintain and 'own' resources once produced. In recent years funders have begun to\naddress the problem by improving central programme support through the provision of\ngeneric workshops, guidance and support, via the creation of networks across common\nprojects and through the introduction of named funding support liaison staff. The\nTeaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP), for example, provided a\ncomprehensive project management handbook, and the Joint Information Systems\nCommittee (JISC) through its 5\/99 and 7\/99 programmes, has in place a variety of valuable\nsupport mechanisms. In addition, the sector now has a developed network of expertise and\n'project professionals' in the management of these kinds of programmes (Beetham, Jones\net al, 2001). There has also been a growth in research and development centres, where a\n13\nGrainne Conole The evolving landscape of learning technology\nnumber of initiatives of this kind co-locate and are then provided with a local support and\ninfrastructure. Importantly these kinds of centres provide a degree of stability to projects\nand associated staff and enable the provision of staff development and sustainability\nbeyond an individual project's lifespan. Examples of centres of this kind include the\nInstitute for Learning and Research Technology (www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk), UKOLN\n(www.ukoln.aauk), and the Learning Technology Research Institute (www.unl.aauk\/ltri).\nHow far do the above go towards enabling the vision of Squires' peripatetic electronic\nteacher (PET)? Certainly there is now a fairly robust technical infrastructure in place and a\nrapidly growing number of ways of getting at resources along with learning object\nmetadata to enable teachers to pick and choose courses. There are also tools for assessment\nand a variety of mechanisms for supporting communication and collaboration online.\nDespite this, the take-up of ICT in teaching is still fairly low. This can be attributed to a\nnumber of factors. It is evident, for example, that staff and students often still lack the\nnecessary ICT skills, as recent reports' on literacy skills and user behaviour highlight\n(Harris, MacKenzie et al, 2002; Rowlings, 2002). Other barriers to large-scale uptake\ninclude resistance to change, lack of time for experimentation and implementation,\ndedicated resources and already adequate mechanisms for ensuring sustainability (Conole,\n2001; Bull, 2002).\nConclusion\nThis paper has provided an overview of learning technology research over the last five\nyears, focusing on the UK. It has described the issues associated with the increased use of\nlearning technologies and its impact within institutions at both strategic and operational\nlevels.\nThroughout these technology-focused programmes a common aim has been to explore and\nreport on the range of technologies and their uses in learning and teaching. Perceived\nbenefits include the potential ICT has in terms of offering access to resources, enhancing\nskills, improving curricula, raising standards, providing mechanisms for sharing practice,\naccessing a range of online materials' and advice, linking up isolated learners, accessing\nauthentic learning (for example use of native speakers in language learning), accessing a\nwide range of quality materials, creating opportunities to tailor materials to specific\ninterests and abilities of the individual and overall enabling the potential to make learning\nmore attractive. However, research has also uncovered related issues, such as the need to\ndevelop robust underlying infrastructures to support these activities, staff and student\ntraining needs, associated cultural and organizational issues, integration with other\nlearning and teaching processes, associated accessibility and legal issues, and the need for\ntransparency over human and technical costs. There is also concern about over-hyping the\npotential of technology and the fact that fictional vignettes which aim to give example\nscenarios of the potential opportunities are often technology-centred and date quickly.\nThe paper set out to consider to what extent the infrastructure and context required for\nSquires' vision of a peripatetic electronic teacher has been achieved. It is clear that learning\ntechnologies are now no longer marginal activities within institutions. They are a\nsignificant part of strategic thinking, as senior managers recognize that a robust technical\ninfrastructure is mission-critical and essential for future success. Furthermore technology\n14\nALT-] Volume 10 Number 3\ntools and resources are increasingly part of the working practice of teachers and students;\nemail is now probably the main communication vehicle, and students and researchers alike\nincreasingly expect resources and papers to be available online through digital libraries and\nother content repositories. However, there is also a recognition of the limitations of\ntechnologies and the value of many traditional practices. Increasingly users look to\nintegrate real with virtual practices using each to its particular strengths. So in one sense we\nare a long way from Squires' visionary peripatetic electronic teacher (and may never\nactually achieve it) but in another sense we could argue that we have moved beyond this,\nwith technologies becoming simply a part of the fabric of higher education, an essential\ntool, used as and when appropriate. The next few years will see ever increasing changes as\napplications such as mobile and wireless network impact and it is likely that a similar\npattern will arise - with innovations giving way to more embedded uses alongside existing\npractices.\nAcknowledgements\nMy thanks go to Martin Dyke and Martin Oliver for all their helpful comments, and to the\ntwo referees who both gave extensive and very useful feedback; as a result, the paper is\nmuch improved.\nReferences\nArmitage, S., Brown, T. and Jenkins, M.
