The use of diffusely scattering materials as a means of eliminating\ninterference fringes has been investigated. Their use introduces laser speckle that can\ncontribute a random, rather than periodic, uncertainty to gas measurements. We have\nestablished a method for quantifying the uncertainty due to speckle and investigated\nways of reducing it. We characterised the speckle at 823nm allowing the use of low\ncost CCD cameras. We have tested the principle of the model by making gas\nabsorption measurements on the 1650nm methane absorption line using wavelength\nmodulation spectroscopy, for which preliminary results are presented.\n1. Introduction\nThe advantages of using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) for trace gas sensing\ninclude; fast response times, high sensitivity and high target gas selectivity. However, the sensitivity\nof many practical TDLAS systems is limited by the formation of unintentional Fabry-Perot\ninterference fringes in the optical path between the source and detector[1]. The spacing between the\nmaxima of these fringes can be in the same wavelength range as Doppler and pressure-broadened\nmolecular line widths (10-3-10-2cm-1)[2]; this can lead to distortion or complete obscuring of the shape\nand strength of the absorption line[3] (Figure 1(c) and 3(b)). Thermal and mechanical instabilities\nmean that the fringes can not be removed by simple subtraction techniques. The formation of fringes is\nshown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Illustration of formation of interference fringes in direct absorption spectroscopy: reflections\nfrom laser windows, detector windows, lenses, and gas cell windows can lead to the formation of\ninterference fringes. (a) gas absorption signal measured with no interference effects. (b) interference\nfringes from an evacuated gas cell (c) gas absorption obscured by interference fringe signals.\nDesign techniques to reduce etalon formation include; the use of optical isolators, use of reflective\nrather than refractive optics, angling and antireflection coating of reflective surfaces[4]. Techniques\nfor eliminating or reducing the amplitude of the fringe signal include: (a) mechanically oscillating the\npath length with external devices[1,5,6], (b) introduction of an asynchronous current in addition to the\nusual modulation current through the laser diode[7], (c) use of alternative waveforms[8,9] and (d)\npostdetection filtering[10]. The disadvantage of method (a) is that the detection bandwidth is limited\nby the mechanical motion and signal integration that is required[11]. Methods (b) and (c) are less\neffective and tend to wash out the gas absorption signal when the free spectral range (FSR) is\ncomparable to the gas absorption linewidth[2]. Sun and Whittaker[11] have demonstrated a variation\nof method (b) that is effective for a wide range of FSR to absorption line width ratios. Post detection\nfiltering can only be applied where the signal and the interference spectra are distinguishable in the\nfrequency domain[2].\nIn general the alignment of the optical components is critical. This often leads to complex designs with\ntight tolerances on optical component alignment, and can therefore be difficult and expensive to\nmaintain in field instruments.\nHere, we present an alternative approach based on the use of diffuse reflections, known in some\ncircumstances to reduce interference fringes[12]. However, their use introduces laser speckle that can\ncontribute an intensity uncertainty to gas detection measurements. This research aims to (a) investigate\nthe deliberate use of diffuse reflections as a means of eliminating interference fringes and (b) quantify\nthe intensity uncertainty due to laser speckle and investigate methods of reducing it. We present\npreliminary results of a systematic study of these effects.\nin\nte\nns\nity\ntime\ndetector\nam\npl\nitu\nde\ntime\nGas absorption Fringes from an\nevacuated gas cell\ngas absorption signal\nmeasured in the\npresence of interference\n(a) (b) (c)\nGas cell\nGas absorption line\nsource\nOur analysis draws heavily from the field of speckle and electronic speckle interferometry; therefore\nwe begin with a brief introduction to speckle fundamentals. Ennos[13] and Jones and Wykes[14] have\ngiven a more comprehensive statistical analysis of speckle.\n2. Speckle theory\nMonochromatic light incident on an optically rough surface is scattered in random directions and the\nsurrounding region is filled with a speckle pattern formed by the interference of the reflected\ncomponents (Figure 2).\nFigure 2.

Key, D; the illuminated area, Z; the distance to the\nobservation plane AB, CD; the image plane\nThe lateral size \u03b5 of the individual speckles at the screen AB (\u03b5o, objective speckle) and CD (\u03b5s\nsubjective speckle) in Figure 2 are given by\n1.22 \/o Z D\uf065 \uf06c\uf03d (1)\n\uf028 \uf0291.22 1 #s F\uf065 \uf06c\uf03d \uf02b\uf050 (2)\nwhere D is the illuminated area, F# is the ratio of the focal length to aperture and \u03a0 the magnification \nat which the lens is operating[13].

The normalised\nstandard deviation or contrast C of a polarised speckle pattern is given by \/C I\uf073\uf03d . The contrast of a\nfully developed static speckle pattern is therefore always equal to unity. Adding M uncorrelated\nspeckle patterns on an irradiance basis results in suppression of speckle contrast to \/C M I\uf073\uf03d [15].\nFocussing lens\nLaser illumination\nDiffusely\nscattering\nsurface\nSpeckle pattern\nAB CD\nZ Adjustable aperture\nD\nThe level of speckle intensity noise on a detector of size d x d is related to the number of speckles N\nand therefore the speckle size \uf065 .

TDLAS\nThe basic principle of TDLAS, its applications and comparisons of the different TDLAS techniques\nhave been described elsewhere in the literature[16]. For our investigations, we have chosen to employ\nwavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS), but the general principle applies to all TDLAS\nmodulation schemes. In WMS, the laser wavelength is modulated by varying the laser drive current at\na frequency of several kilohertz. The laser wavelength can be simultaneously scanned across a single\ngas absorption line by a ramp signal at a frequency lower than the modulation frequency typically\nseveral Hertz. The detected signal is then demodulated by a phase sensitive detector at the modulating\nfrequency or its harmonics. The principle of WMS is illustrated in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Illustration of the principle of WMS. (a) harmonic signals generated in the absence of\ninterference fringes, (b) harmonic signals distorted by interference fringes.\nThe use of phase sensitive detection leads to a significant improvement in signal to noise ratio by\nreducing the measurement bandwidth. In addition, detection at higher harmonics shifts the operation to\nhigher frequencies, at which laser excess noise is reduced and intensity modulation removed. The\nWMS set up for methane detection at 1651nm is described in section 7.1 and illustrated in Figure 14.\nfrequency\nGas absorption line\nModulation\nwaveform\ntra\nns\nm\nitt\nan\nce Demodulator(lock in amplifier)\nDetected signal\n1st harmonic signal\n2nd harmonic signal\n3rd harmonic signal\n+\nRamp waveform scans laser frequency slowly\nacross the gas line\n2nd harmonic\nsignal\nTime\/seconds\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n\/v\nol\nts\nSlow scan\nwaveform\nData logging\nHarmonic signal distorted by fringes\n(a) (b)\n3rd harmonic\nsignal\n4. Use of diffuse reflections in TDLAS\nWe designed a model of the WMS setup at 823nm so we could view the speckle with a silicon CCD\ncamera. The experimental configuration shown in Figure 4 included: (i) a tunable diode laser driven so\nas to simulate TDLAS based gas detection, (ii) various geometries (including reflection and\ntransmission types) of a simulated gas cell containing a diffusely scattering surface in combination\nwith one of a number of different types of window (a wedged window is illustrated) and (iii) an\ninterrogation system employing a silicon CCD camera. We used single mode optical fibre for beam\ndelivery where it was more convenient to do so. The fibre based setup is described below.\n4.1. Experimental setup\nA 150mW single longitudinal mode laser diode (Spectra Diode Labs 5400 series) emitting at 823nm\nwas coupled into a singlemode fibre with angle cleaved (8 degrees) end faces via a Faraday isolator.\nThe isolator served to prevent feedback into the laser cavity which could have detrimental effects on\nthe optical characteristics of the diode. The laser operating current and temperature were controlled by\nProfile LDC 202 and TED 200 controllers respectively. The light was divided by a 50:50 coupler. One\narm was passed to a Fabry Perot scanning interferometer (Tec-Optics FPI25) for monitoring the laser\ndiode emission wavelength. The other arm was directed to the gas cell model via a beam splitter. A\ncalibrated variable aperture was used at the imaging lens L3 to control the F# of the system. This\ndetermines the size of the speckles at the detector array according to equation (2). The light from the\ngas cell was detected by a CCD camera (Pearpoint P176, 8 bit camera with 11.5\u00b5m \u00d713\u00b5m pixels).\nThe video signal from the camera was transferred to a frame grabbing card (National Instruments\nIMAQ PCI 1408) housed in a computer running LabviewTM software. We could use either the CCD\ncamera or a detector as the sensor for quantitative analysis of the speckle related uncertainty. The\nCCD camera was used for quantitative analysis only for speckle sizes \u03b5 comparable or larger than the\npixel sizes rp. For \u03b5 << rp, the detector was used as the sensor for quantitative analysis and the camera\nfor alignment and qualitative analysis only. This was done to maintain the validity of the statistics\nused. The detector was mounted on a micrometer xyz translator that has a resolution of 50\u00b5m and\ntranslation of 13mm in all axes. We used amplified detectors with variable gain of 3 different sizes\n(Thorlabs PDA400; 0.8mm2, PDA55; 12.96mm2, and PDA50B; 19.6mm2). The detector output was\nfed to a lock in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR850).\nFigure 4. Experimental setup for investigating the use of diffuse reflections in WMS. Key, L1, L2, L3;\nlens, APC; angle polished connector, BS; beam splitter.\n4.2. Experimental confirmation of speckle behaviour\nWe conducted a number of experiments described below to verify that our configuration was valid for\nconducting speckle related investigations.\n4.2.1. Speckle size.\nBy varying the diameter of the adjustable aperture in Figure 4 and observing the speckle field formed,\nwe confirmed that the lateral speckle size of the subjective speckle was related to the F# according to\nequation (2). Speckle fields corresponding to aperture diameters of 1mm and 0.6mm are shown in\nFigure 5.\n4.2.2. Interferometric speckle.\nThe window on gas cell model in Figure 4 could be aligned such that the object beam (scattered light\nfrom the diffuser) and the reference beam (specular reflection from the window) combined coherently\nto form an interferogram (interferometric speckle) or misaligned such that only the object beam (non-\ninterferometric speckle) was imaged by the lens onto the CCD camera. We confirmed that we could\nobtain interferometric speckle with our configuration by performing a technique commonly referred to\nas static frame subtraction in Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI)[17].

The\nobject is then displaced and the digitized live interferogram of the deformed state of the object is\nsubtracted pixel by pixel from the stored signal. Areas of the two images where the speckle pattern\nremains in phase will give a resultant signal of zero, while out of phase areas will give non-zero\nsignals[14]. Correlation ESPI fringes obtained with the experimental set up shown in Figure 4 are\nshown in Figure 5(c). These were obtained by heating the diffuse surface (metallic surface covered\nwith retroreflective tape) and then performing static frame subtraction as the diffuse object cooled\ndown. In subtraction ESPI, correlation fringes can only be obtained in the case of interferometric\nspeckle.\nFigure 5. (a) Small speckles corresponding to a large aperture (1mm), (b) large speckles (0.6mm\naperture), (c) correlation fringes obtained by performing subtraction ESPI using speckles larger than\nthe CCD pixels.\n4.3. Statistics of practical speckle\nThe speckle theory outlined in section 2 is based on the assumption that the surface height deviations\nare large in comparison to the wavelength of the radiation illuminating it, and that the resultant speckle\nfield is completely polarised. In general surfaces at which polarised light is singly scattered give rise to\npolarised speckle, this includes lightly-scattering transmission elements, such as ground glass. Bulk\ndiffusers (surfaces into which light penetrates and is multiply scattered) on the other hand, such as\nmatt white paint or opal glass, depolarise the light and thus do not generate a fully developed speckle\npattern[13]. The statistics of speckle from surfaces with height deviations less than the illuminating\nwavelength have been shown to depend on the surface roughness[18]. The purpose of this section is to\ninvestigate the possibility of exploiting the characteristics of under developed speckle as a means of\nreducing the speckle related intensity uncertainty.\nWe investigated a number of diffusely scattering materials including PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene),\nMacor (white machinable ceramic), ground glass, opal glass, spectralonTM (a PTFE based material\nmade by Labsphere), metallic surfaces painted with reflective paint (Reflect made by Rocol) and\nretroreflective tape. Due to different levels of scattering and depolarisation in the different samples the\nspeckle fields are expected to exhibit various levels of development (0<C<1). The speckle patterns\n(a) (b) (c)\ngenerated by the various samples were characterised by plotting probability density function, contrast\nand observing the size of the speckle. For these experiments we used a HeNe laser emitting at\n632.8nm for convenience. The experimental setup is shown in Figure 6 (only the reflective geometry\nis illustrated).\nFigure 6. Experimental setup for characterising properties of speckle from various scattering\nmaterials. Key: P; polariser, A; analyser, BS; beam splitter, f; focal length of lens L1 and L2.\nLight from a linearly polarised HeNe was directed onto the target samples. Transmitted or reflected\nlight was then directed either to a detector or a CCD camera after passage through the gas cell model.\nLenses were used as gas cell windows; L1 collimated the scattered light and L2 focussed the light on\nto the detector. The detector signal was passed to a lock in amplifier that was locked to the chopper\nfrequency.\n4.3.1. Dependence of speckle statistics on surface roughness.\nFujii and Asakura[18] have investigated the effect of surface roughness on the statistical distribution of\nimage speckle intensity. They have shown that the probability distribution and the standard deviation\nof the intensity fluctuations in image speckle patterns are strongly dependent on the surface roughness\nh. The probability distribution was found to vary from a negative exponential distribution for surfaces\nwith h>\u03bb to a blend of Poissonian and Gaussian distributions for decreasing value of roughness. They \nsimilarly found that the standard deviation of the intensity fluctuations increases almost linearly with\nincreasing roughness and then levels off at a constant value. This constant value corresponds to the\nfully developed speckle condition. We captured images of speckle patterns from various samples\nobtained under identical conditions to confirm the dependence of speckle size on surface roughness.\nThe images were captured with L2 (Figure 6) removed. For most of the samples (Macor, spectralonTM,\nspray painted surface, retroreflective tape), there were no visible differences in speckle size. However\nPTFE gave rise to visibly smaller speckle. The speckle images from the PTFE and spectralonTM are\nshown in Figure 7. The images were caputerd with lens L1 operating at F# = 2.6 and with a static\nCCD camera\n2f\nData\nacquisition\nf\nRotating\ndiffuser\nAmplified\ndetector\nLock in\namplifier\nData\nacquisition\nchopper\nf\nSimulated gas cell\nBS BSMotor\ncontroller\nHeNe\nL1 L2\nP\nA\nChopper\ncontroller\ndiffuser. This appears to suggest that speckle related intensity uncertainty can be reduced by using\ndiffusers with surface height deviations less than the wavelength of the illuminating light. In future we\nplan to carry out a systematic investigation of the last point by measuring the surface roughness of our\nsamples and using computational techniques for estimating speckle size.\nFigure 7. Dependence of speckle size on surface roughness. (a) SPECTRALONTM (460 \u00d7460 pixels),\n(b) 10mm thick PTFE (460 \u00d7460 pixels)\n4.3.2. Degree of polarisation (DOP).\nLight emerging from a scattering medium illuminated by linearly polarised light consists of linearly\nand randomly polarised photons[19]. This is directly related to the number of scattering events\nexperienced by the photons. In section 4.2.2 we demonstrated interference effects by coherently\nadding a speculary reflected beam to a speckle pattern from a surface scatterer. This was possible\nbecause the speckle pattern had a high DOP (degree of polarisation). From a gas sensing point of view\ndepolarised speckle is preferable for several reasons. Firstly, depolarised speckle is under developed,\ntherefore we expect the contrast to be less than unity. The argument for this has been summarised by\nEnnos[13] as follows; \u201csince the speckle phenomenon is itself an interference one, a true \u2018fully\ndeveloped\u2019 speckle pattern can derive only from interference of light that is all polarised in the same\nmanner\u201d. Secondly, depolarised speckle will produce reduced visibility of interference effects if it\ncombines with specular reflections from elsewhere in the optical system in comparison to polarised\nspeckle. Thirdly, polarization effects have been shown to affect the number of speckles integrated by\nthe detector with the maximum number of speckles occurring when the incident light is completely\ndepolarised by the diffuse reflector[20]. Therefore, in addition to speckle size and detector size, the\nnumber of speckles integrated by a detector also depends on the amount of depolarization from the\ndiffuse scatterer. We conducted an experiment to measure the DOLP (degree of linear polarisation) of\nscattered light from the various samples. The DOLP is given by[19]\nP C\nP C\nI IDOLP\nI I\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\n(5)\nwhere Ip and Ic are the mean intensities measured with parallel and crossed polarisers respectively[20].\nThe results are presented in Table 1 below.\nSPECTRALONTM PTFE\nTable 1.

The polarisers were only used for\nthis experiment. As expected the surface scatters exhibit a high DOLP compared to the bulk or volume\nscatters.\n4.3.3. Integrated and blurred speckle.\nIn practice speckle intensity measurements are made with detectors with finite apertures. As a result\nthe measured intensity is an integrated version of the ideal point detector. Relative motion between the\ndetector and the scattering surface can also lead to blurring of the speckles leading to reduction in\ncontrast. The first-order statistics of integrated and blurred speckles have been considered by\nGoodman[21]. He has shown that for a non stationary speckle pattern, the mean of the measured\nintensity is equal to the true mean of the static pattern. Adding M independent speckle patterns has\nbeen shown to reduce the uncertainty by M [20].\nStatistically uncorrelated speckle patterns were generated by capturing ten images (set 1) whilst the\ndiffuser was rotated very slowly using the experimental setup of Figure 6. From these images a set of\nnine images were generated by computing the average of K images where K= 2, 3\u2026..10. We then\ncalculated the contrast of the average images. We also took ten images of the diffuser whilst stationary\n(set 2) at arbitrary time intervals between 30 seconds and 120 seconds. These were also subjected to\nthe same processing as set 1. Figure 8 shows the averaged images and the plots of their corresponding\nprobability density functions. Also shown in Figure 8 are the 3D representations of the intensity\ndistribution corresponding to one speckle pattern and the average of ten speckle patterns. The plot of\ncontrast against number of images averaged for the two sets of images is shown in Figure 9.

Effect of wavelength modulation on speckle.\nWe investigated the level of uncertainty that relates to wavelength modulation by considering an\nintensity measurement made at one wavelength \u03bb with a second measurement made within a short \nmodulation period, at a second wavelength (\u03bb+\u03b4\u03bb). We examined the effect of the wavelength \nmodulation on interferometric and non-interferometric speckle on a scale relevant to gas detection\nusing direct spectroscopy wavelength modulation spectroscopy.\n5.1.1. Effect of wavelength modulation on non-interferometric speckle.\nFor non-interferometric speckle, the expected change in the speckle field due to wavelength change\ncan be estimated by evaluating (4) at \u03bb1and \u03bb1+\u03b4\u03bb. For example, substituting F# = 2.5, \u03bb1 = 1650nm\nand \u03b4\u03bb = 10GHz in (4), the proportional change in speckle related uncertainty is 6\u00d710\n-5. This level of\nuncertainty is relevant to differential measurements or when scanning across the gas line to obtain the\nharmonic line shapes or for direct spectroscopy. For line locked WMS with a residual frequency jitter\nof 10MHz the proportional change in speckle related uncertainty is 6\u00d710-8. The speckle related\nuncertainty due to wavelength change of non-interferometric speckle is below the level of a static\nspeckle field.\n5.1.2. Effect of wavelength modulation on interferometric speckle.\nInterferograms (a polarised speckle pattern combined with a smooth reference wave or a another\nspeckle pattern) obtained at different wavelengths have a phase difference that is associated with the\nwavelength change. This applies only if the two interferograms remain spatially correlated in the\nmeasurement interval. Sirohi[17] has shown that the phase difference \u03b4\uf066 created between such\ninterferograms is equal to\n(a) (b)\n22 \/L\uf064\uf066 \uf070 \uf064\uf06c \uf06c\uf03d (6)\nwhere in our case, L is the physical path difference between the wedged window and the scattering\nsurface in Figure 4. The value of \u03b4\uf066 determines whether the observed speckle fields are in phase or out\nof phase, with the correlation coefficient being given by[17]\n( ) (1 cos ) \/ 2\uf072 \uf064\uf066 \uf064\uf066\uf03d \uf02b (7)\nThus, for increasing \u03b4\uf066, the speckle fields alternate between \uf072(\u03b4\uf066) = 1 (in phase) and \uf072(\u03b4\uf066) = 0 (out of\nphase). If the speckle fields are in phase, we expect the speckle-related noise to reduce to zero for\ndifferential measurements. We conducted an experiment to obtain a plot of the correlation of\ninterferograms corresponding to different wavelengths. We used a technique that was employed by\nOlszak and Tatam[22] to calibrate the path-length imbalance in optical fibre ESPI systems. We used\nthe experimental setup of Figure 4.\nThe specular reflection from the wedged window was used as the reference smooth wave. The method\nadopted was to store a reference interferogram for an initial injection current or wavelength value. The\nwavelength was scanned by a ramping the injection current, causing a corresponding change in the\nphase. New interferograms were acquired continuously. The subsequent images were then subtracted\nfrom the reference image pixel by pixel, the result rectified and the average intensity of the resultant\nimage calculated. A plot of average intensity against current is shown in Figure 11.\nFigure 11. A plot average intensity that maps the phase change of the interferometer with wavelength.\nThe troughs correspond to \uf072(\u03b4\uf066) = 1 (in phase) and the peaks correspond to\uf072(\u03b4\uf066) = 0 (out of phase).\nThe plot is on a sloping background due to simultaneous wavelength and intensity modulation. The\nperiod of the ramp waveform was 100 seconds. This allowed a sufficient number of frames to be\ncaptured in the interval 0 < \u03b4\uf066 < \u03c0. When the phase shift equalled \u03c0 the average intensity attained its\nmaximum value and when it was 2\u03c0 the average intensity was a minimum; that is, subtracting from a\nspeckle image an identical speckle image results in a \u2018black\u2019 (zero-intensity) image. Approximately 16\nmaxima could be seen in a 26.6 GHz interval, yielding an etalon spacing of 9.2cm.

These observations suggest that the fringes originate from the low finesse\ncavity formed by the simulated gas cell. This shows that an interference fringe like signal can occur\ndue to wavelength modulation of interferometric speckle.\n6. Implications of speckle related uncertainty for TDLAS\nIn this section we will consider the implications of the non-interferometric and interferometric speckle\nrelated uncertainty on direct spectroscopy and wavelength modulation spectroscopy using the gas cell\nmodel illustrated in Figure 4. We simulated the aforementioned techniques by driving the laser diode\nappropriately. The live camera speckle images were simultaneously recorded and the individual\nframes were saved as sequential bitmap files or an AVI (audio video interleave) file.\n6.1. Direct spectroscopy\nIn direct spectroscopy the laser is tuned over the absorption line by either ramping the operating\ncurrent or temperature. The principle of direct spectroscopy is illustrated in Figure 1. We simulated\ndirect spectroscopy by scanning the laser frequency over a 26GHz range. This was achieved by\nmodulating the operating current with a low frequency ramp signal whilst continuously recording the\nspeckle images and saving them to an AVI file. A number of programs were written in LabviewTM to\nread and process AVI files. One program converted the image frames into an array of individual pixel\ndata. The array was then divided the array into grids (pixel binning) representing our detection system.\nWe could choose the size of the bins to match the size of our detectors or any arbitrary size (see Figure\n12). Another program divided the image array into ten bins of user selectable size and origin (see\nFigure 12(b))\nFigure 12. Illustration of the different types of pixel binning that were employed. (a) images were\ndivided into equal bins size bins equivalent to detector size (b) different size bins used to evaluate the\neffect of averaging different number of pixel.\n(a) (b)\n6.1.1. Non-interferometric speckle.\nIn section 5.1.1, it was established that the speckle related intensity uncertainty of non-interferometric\nspeckle due to wavelength modulation is below the level of a static field. Therefore the level of noise\nin this case will be similar to that of a static field. We examined the uncertainty of a static field by\nconsidering the uncertainty associated with placing a detector of a particular size in different areas of\nthe speckle field by using the binning method illustrated in Figure 12(a). For a given bin (or detector)\nsize the speckle related measurement uncertainty was calculated from the mean intensity of each bin\nand the standard deviation of the mean intensities of all the bins. The exercise was done for various\nbin sizes and two different speckle sizes. We used the images shown in Figure 7. The results are\npresented in Table 2. As expected, for small areas the uncertainty is higher.\nTable 2.

The AVI file was processed using the binning method\nillustrated in Figure 12(b). The average intensity of each bin for all the frames was computed and\nplotted as a graph of average intensity against time corresponding to the signal that would be recorded\nby a detector of a given size placed in a particular position. We observed interference fringes\nsuperimposed on the ramp signal that was used to scan the laser frequency. We investigated the effect\nof detector size on the visibility of the fringes. We varied the area over which the speckles were\naveraged by using the binning method illustrated in Figure 12(b). The intensity of each pixel varies as\n(7), however the phases of the pixels are randomly distributed. Therefore by averaging a sufficient\nnumber of pixels, a reduction in the visibility of the fringes is expected. Shown in Figure 13 are the\nplots obtained for detector or bin sizes comprising of one pixel and a hundred pixels. The approximate\nmaximum peak to peak intensity excursions for the different averaging areas are shown in Table 3.\nFigure 13. Reduction in the visibility of the interference fringes with increasing modelled detector\nsize. Fringes were formed by modulating interferometric speckle. After a certain detector size, further\nincrease of the detector size yields no significant reduction in the amplitude of the interference fringes\nTable 3.

Gas absorption measurements\nAn experiment was conducted to confirm the dependency of the speckle related uncertainty on the\nnumber of speckles integrated by the detector for the case of non-interferometric speckle. A calibrated\nvariable aperture was placed in front of a large area detector (19.6mm2) and methane gas concentration\nwas measured at 3 different aperture sizes. The experimental set up is described below.\n7.1. Experimental setup for Gas absorption measurements\nModulated light from a custom DFB (distributed feed back) laser diode (configuration similar to van\nWell et al[23]) was coupled into a single mode fibre circulator (FiberLogix FCIR-65-2-L-1) with\nangle polished connectors through an antireflection coated aspheric lens. The DFB laser was driven by\na current controller (Thorlabs LDC 202) and a temperature controller (Thorlabs TED 200). The\nmodulation of the DFB current was achieved by supplying the current controller with a 6 kHz sine\nwaveform from a signal generator (Hewlett Packard HP33120A). This waveform was also supplied to\nlock in amplifiers (Stanford Research Systems SR850) as a reference signal.\nFigure 14. The experimental setup for methane gas detection using WMS. Key: SA, spectrum\nanalyser; PID, proportional-integral-differential; APC, angle polished connector, Ref; reference signal\nsupplied to the lock in amplifiers\nThe output light was directed onto a large area (19mm2) amplified detector (Thorlabs PD50B) after\npassage through a 10cm long gas cell with a ground glass front window`. The output of the detector\namplifier was fed to 2 lock in amplifiers (Stanford Research Systems SR850) for phase sensitive\ndetection at 6kHz (1f) and 12kHz (2f). The 2f signal was then normalised by the 1f signal. Both the 2f\nand 1f signals are directly proportional to the incident intensity. Therefore dividing one by the other\nDFB module with\nreference gas cell\nand photodiode\n3f signal\n1f Lock-in amp\nLaser driver\nTemp\ncontroller\nPID circuit\nSine generator\n\uf0e5\n3f Lock-in amp\nRef\nFibre circulator with APC\nends\namplifier\namplified detector\n10cm\nramp generator\nGas cell\nFrequency\nstabilisation\nRef\n2f Lock-in amp\nRef 2f\/1f\naperture\nGround glass\nremoves this incident power dependency. The normalised 2f signal was transferred to a computer\nrunning LabviewTM software through data acquisition card (National Instruments PCI 6259)\nWithin the DFB module, light from the rear facet of the DFB is falls onto a Ge photodiode that is\nenclosed in a standard TO can containing 100% methane. This served as a reference methane gas cell.\nThe photodiode signal was amplified by a transimpedance amplifier (100k\u03a9 gain) before being fed to\na lock in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR850) where it was demodulated at 18 kHz. The 3f\nsignal was used by a feed back control circuit for locking the laser frequency to the peak of the 2f gas\nabsorption line.\n7.2. Gas measurements with different detector size\nA calibrated variable aperture was placed in front of the large area detector (19mm2 active area).\nMethane gas concentration was measured at 3 different aperture sizes (diameters; 1mm, 3mm and\n12mm). Methane (2.5% concentration) was gradually diluted with hydrocarbon free air using gas flow\ncontrollers (Telydyne THPS-400-230). The peak 2f signal normalised by the 1f signal was recorded\nfor different concentrations; from an initial concentration of 1000ppm down to 25ppm (ppm, parts per\nmillion). The results for measurements with the 3mm and 12mm apertures placed in front of the\ndetector are shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16 respectively.\n8. Results\nAt concentrations below 125ppm; gas absorption measurements with the 1mm aperture were\nindistinguishable from background signals and it can be seen from the inserts in Figure 15 and Figure\n16 that measurements made with the 3mm aperture have a higher associated uncertainty than those\nmade with the 12mm aperture placed in front of the detector.\nFigure 15.
