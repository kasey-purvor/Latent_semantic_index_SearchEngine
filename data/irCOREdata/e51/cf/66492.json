High-\nenergy particle accelerators and medical resonance\nimaging body scanners are limited by the BC2 for NbTi\n( \u0003 10 T). Gigahertz class nuclear-magnetic-resonance\nand high field laboratory magnets are limited by BC2\nfor Nb3Sn ( \u0003 23 T) [1]. According to BCS theory,\nBC2\u00010\u0002 for a superconductor at zero temperature is given\nby [2,3]:\nBC2\u00010\u0002 \u0004 R\u00011\u0002=R\u0001\btr\u0002\u00068:3\u0007 1034\u0001\fTC=S\u00022 \b 3:1\n\u0007 103\fTC\u0003N\t; (1)\nwhere R\u00011\u0002=R\u0001\btr\u0002 is a strong-coupling correction close\nto unity, \f is the Sommerfeld constant, TC is the critical\ntemperature, S is the Fermi surface area, and \u0003N is the\nnormal state resistivity. Therefore, BC2\u00010\u0002 can be in-\ncreased by increasing \u0003N as long as any reduction in TC\nand \f is minimized. Whether the mechanism causing\nthe superconductivity is BCS-like or not, Ginzburg-\nLandau (GL) theory [4] shows that in the vicinity of a\nsuperconducting-insulating barrier, BC2 is increased.\nHence, there is strong evidence that increasing disorder,\neither by increasing \u0003N or from reduced-size effects,\nincreases BC2 [5].\nChemical doping or alloying has been used as the main\nroute for improving BC2 of bulk superconductors by pro-\nducing disorder from the lattice strain and change in\nthe local electronic properties. Low-level doping in-\ncreases \u0003N , but the enhancements of BC2 (4.2 K) have\nbeen small, \u00030:3 T in NbTi doped with Ta and Hf [6],\n\u00034 T in Nb3Sn doped with Ti, Ta, Zr, Mo, and V [7].\nFurther increases in \u0003N by high-level doping depress BC2\nrapidly [7,8]. Nevertheless, there are precedents for large\nincreases in BC2 that are correlated with large increases in\n\u0003N . In thin films, increases in BC2\u00010\u0002 of \u00039 T have been\nreported for Nb3Sn [3] and > 40 T for MgB2 [9]. These\nincreases were attributed to alloying and strain. In a\nmetal-insulator nanocomposite synthesized by injecting\nindium into 56 \u0015A pore diameter Vycor glass, an increase\nin BC2\u00010\u0002 by a factor of \u0003100 has been found [10]. GL\ntheory implies that the small crystallite size increased\nBC2\u00010\u0002 by reducing the electron mean-free path and,\nhence, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length (\u0010).\nHigh energy mechanical milling has been used as an\neffective way to synthesize large quantities of disordered,\nnanocrystalline and amorphous powders containing large\namounts of vacancies, dislocations, and grain boundaries\n[11,12]. Nanocrystalline bulk materials can then be ob-\ntained with different levels of disorder by subsequently\ncompacting and heat treating the milled powder [13,14].\nNanocrystalline materials exhibit unique properties, such\nas increased strength, improved ductility, enhanced ther-\nmal expansion coefficient , and superior soft magnetic\nproperties compared to conventional polycrystalline ma-\nterials [13].\nIn this Letter, we report resistive and magnetic data in\nhigh magnetic fields and x-ray diffraction (XRD) data on\ndisordered nanocrystalline bulk PbMo6S8. The disorder\nreduces the electron mean-free path in these materials to\nonly \u00031 nm, which is about an order of magnitude\nsmaller than the grain size and it also has significantly\nless effect on the bulk electronic density of states than\ndoping. Hence, the superconducting coherence length in\nthese materials is made sufficiently small to produce an\nunprecedented increase in BC2\u00010\u0002 for PbMo6S8 from 50 T\nin bulk materials up to > 100 T.\nThe superconducting PbMo6S8 powder used in the\npresent study was mechanically milled for 200 h under\nan Ar gas atmosphere. The milled powder was consoli-\ndated using hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at different tem-\nperatures and a pressure of 2000 bars for 8 h and\npostannealed at 1000 \nC for 40 h so as to achieve differ-\nent levels of disorder and, hence, \u0003N . The details of the\nfabrication have been described previously [15].\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending11 JULY 2003VOLUME 91, NUMBER 2\n027002-1 0031-9007=03=91(2)=027002(4)$20.00 \uf6d9 2003 The American Physical Society 027002-1\nIn Fig. 1, the very broad XRD peaks for the powder\nmilled for 200 h are due to the formation of nanocrystal-\nline and amorphous material which has been confirmed\nusing electron diffraction analysis [15]. The average hex-\nagonal lattice parameters (a; c) of the nanocrystalline\nphase determined from XRD data using a full pattern\nleast squares \u2018\u2018Pawley method\u2019\u2019 are much larger (a \u0004\n9:380 \u0015A, c \u0004 12:260 \u0015A) than those of the conventional\npowder (a \u0004 9:198 \u0015A, c \u0004 11:495 \u0015A). Larger lattice pa-\nrameters are usually observed when the grain size is just a\nfew nanometers [17]. The grain size and lattice strain of\nthe HIP samples were calculated from the XRD data\nusing the Hall-Williamson method [18] in which\nF cos\u0014=\b \u0004 1=d\b 4\" sin\u0014=\b, where F is the difference\nof the full width at half maximum (FWHM) between the\nnanocrystalline sample and the conventional sample, d is\ngrain size, \" is lattice strain, and \u0014 is Bragg angle. After\nHIP at 800 \nC, relatively sharp XRD peaks appeared due\nto crystallization of the amorphous phase and grain\ngrowth (d \u0004 20 nm, \" \u0004 0:07%, a \u0004 9:220 \u0015A, and c \u0004\n11:455 \u0015A). With increasing temperature of annealing, the\nXRD peaks became even sharper but still broader than\nthose of the conventional sample (sample 1). Hence, dis-\nordered nanocrystalline bulk samples (samples 2 and 3)\nwith grain sizes between 20 and 90 nm were obtained, as\nshown in Table I.\nTable I presents the values of the normal state resistivity\nat 16 K [\u0003N (16 K)], room-temperature resistivity ratios\n(RRR), and critical temperature (TC). The values of TC\ndetermined using the criterion of 0:95\u0003N systematically\ndecrease from 15.05 K for sample 1 to 12.30 K for sample\n3 correlated with a decrease in RRR and a large increase\nin \u0003N (16 K) from 80 to 680 \u0017\u001dcm.\nThe magnetization of the samples was measured in\nmagnetic fields up to 12 T at temperatures up to \u000315 K\nusing a commercial vibrating sample magnetometer.\nFigure 2 shows the magnetization magnetic field (M-H)\ncurves obtained for samples 1 and 3 after subtracting the\nbackground. The reversible region of the M-H loops at the\nhighest fields (typically above 9 T) was extrapolated to\nzero magnetization at each temperature to obtain experi-\nmental values of @M=@B, BC2\u0001T\u0002, and @BC2=@TjTC .\nBC2\u00010\u0002 was then calculated using Werthamer-Helfand-\nHohenberg theory [19]:\nBC2\u00010\u0002 \u0004 \f0:7TC@BC2=@TjTC: (2)\nThe Ginzburg-Landau parameter, \u001b, was calculated using\nthe Abrikosov equation [20]:\n\u00170M \u0004 \f \u0001BC2 \f B\u0002\u00012\u001b2 \f 1\u0002\u001cA\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001BC2 ; (3)\nwhere \u001cA \u0004 1:16.

Sample 3 has a\nsubstantially higher value of \f@BC2=@TjTC (14:1 TK\f1)\nthan sample 1 (4:6 TK\f1) and a commensurately higher\nvalue of BC2\u00010\u0002 (110 T compared to 45 T). In the nano-\ncrystalline samples, \u001b increases and \u0010\u00010\u0002 decreases with\nincreasing \u0003N . Importantly, the disorder reduces the value\nof \u0010\u00010\u0002 to a much smaller value than the grain size (d),\nwhich indicates a high level of intragranular defects and\nis consistent with the change in lattice parameters deter-\nmined from XRD data and reported for nanocrystalline\nmaterials that have been supersaturated with vacancies\n[17]. The values of BC\u00010\u0002 for the nanocrystalline and\nstandard polycrystalline samples are similar and confirm\nthat the higher values of BC2\u00010\u0002 are bulk properties.\nDespite the large range of reversible magnetization (see\nFig. 2), the value of critical current density (JC) at 4.2 K\nand zero field is \u00032:0\u0007 109 Am\f2 as shown in Table I,\nthe highest reported in bulk materials of PbMo6S8. The\nhigh value of JC is believed to be due to the increase\nin intragranular defects and grain boundaries acting\nas pinning centers [23] and improved intergranular\nconnectivity.\nResistive measurements made on samples 1 and 3 in\nmagnetic fields up to 15 T and temperatures 6 to 16 K are\nshown in Fig. 3. For sample 1, increasing the magnetic\nfield results in a shift of the entire resistive transition\nto lower temperature, characteristic of conventional low\ntemperature superconductors. In contrast, the high-\nresistivity nanocrystalline sample 3 has a nearly constant\nonset temperature for superconductivity with a broadened\ntransition in high fields characteristic of the Y-, Bi-, and\nTl-cuprate high-temperature superconductors [24]. If an\narbitrary resistive criterion of, for instance, 0:95\u0003N is\nused, the value of BC2\u00010\u0002 is \u000368 T for sample 3, much\nhigher than 53 T for sample 1. However, as reported for\nthe high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7, there\nwas no distinct identifiable feature of BC2 in the resistive\ndata [24].\nIn order to compare the nanocrystalline samples\nwith doped samples, Table I lists the superconduct-\ning parameters of two Cu doped PbMo6S8 samples,\nPb1\fxCu1:8xMo6S8 with x \u0004 0:02 (sample 4) and 0.10\n(sample 5), respectively. The values of \u0003N (16 K) increase\nwith increasing Cu content. A combination of relatively\nhigh \u0003N\u000116 K\u0002 \u0004 800 \u0017\u001dcm and TC \u0004 13:65 K were\nobtained in the Cu doped sample 5. However, sample 4\nshows only a slight increase in BC2\u00010\u0002 to 50 T. Further\nincreasing Cu content to x \u0004 0:10 leads to a decrease of\nBC2\u00010\u0002 to 45 T (sample 5). A similar behavior with\ndoping has also been found in Nb3Sn [7,8].\nThe reduction in \f, shown in Table I, for the milled\nand doped samples compared to the conventional sample\nis consistent with a very general consideration of\nthe uncertainty relation &E&\" \u0004 'h which suggests that\n-300\n-250\n-200\n-150\n-100\n-50\n0\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n14.0 K\n13.6 K\n13.2 K\n12.8 K\n12.4 K\n(a)\nMagnetic field (T)\nM\nag\nne\ntis\nat\nio\nn \n(A\nm-\n1 )\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n10.8 K\n10.5 K\n10.2 K\n9.9 K\n9.6 K\n9.3 K\n9.0 K\n8.7 K (b)\nMagnetic field (T)\nM\nag\nne\ntis\nat\nio\nn \n(A\nm-\n1 )\nFIG. 2.

Hence, given the effect of disorder on\n\f, the relatively small reduction in TC found in all the\nsamples may result from the strong coupling in these\nmaterials and possibly an increase in the electron-phonon\ncoupling as found in other superconductors [27] produced\nby phonon softening [7]. If the Cu doped sample 5 in\nTable I is compared with the nanocrystalline sample 3,\nthey have similar \u0003N and TC, but \f is different by a factor\nof \u00032. Hence, nanocrystalline disorder is significantly\nmore effective than doping at increasing scattering with-\nout reducing the electronic density of states. Indeed, it\ncan be noted that an enhancement of \f has been predicted\nby theory for some nanocrystalline materials [28,29] and\nfound using low temperature specific heat measurements\n[13,29].\nIntragranular defects found in the disordered nano-\ncrystalline materials produce electron scattering on a\nsmaller scale than the grain size. The disorder in the\nnanocrystalline materials has a significantly less detri-\nmental effect on the electronic density of states than that\nproduced by doping. Future research into metastable ma-\nterials may yet provide a new class of highly disordered\nsuperconductors with very high BC2\u00010\u0002.\nWe would like to thank Dr. J. S. O.
