There is\ninsufficient room for growth in its current commercial niche, so GTBank has\ndecided that the emerging Nigerian retail banking sector is its growth pathway.\nHowever, there are big challenges: GTBank\u2019s brand, marketing mix, people\nand operating methods are finely tuned for corporate banking and it is not\nimmediately obvious how it will leverage its assets to compete in the emerging\nretail banking market.

How does it leverage that which\nmakes it special so that it offers some compelling advantage for its new\ncustomers? Can the niche brand execute well on a large scale? How does it\nembed its values and behaviours in a new context? Does it have the money,\npeople, culture and ambition to take share from established competitors in the\nnew market segments? Will its expansion plans make its core business more\nvulnerable to competitors?\nThe case explores the strategic context using the established marketing\nplanning tools of PESTE and SWOT and features advertising themes the\nBank has developed for mass-market communication purposes to illustrate\nthe far reaching implications of the expansion of its retail business.\n2Tayo\u2019s Dilemma\nIn early December 2006, Tayo Aderinokun, the co-founder and Managing\nDirector (CEO) of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) of Nigeria, was sitting at his\ndesk on the top floor of GTBank\u2019s head office with his marketing team and\nnew advertising agency. The meeting had been called to review a proposed\nfirst-ever TV campaign for the bank designed to reposition the brand so it\ncould compete better in the emerging retail banking market as well as in its\ntraditional corporate niche. With a proposed budget almost 10 times that of\nGTBank\u2019s normal advertising investment, Tayo knew the decision was a very\nbig step for him to take. Never before had the bank invested so much capital\nin marketing nor had the bank\u2019s staff or their customers seen GTBank as a\nretail bank.\nIt was clear to Tayo that the tone and execution of the advertising were right,\nthe brand team was very excited at the prospect of mass communications and\nthat the CRM system and the bank\u2019s contact centre were ready to go live. It\nwas now time for Tayo to reflect on the changes made to the bank\u2019s marketing\nstrategy before finally signing off the plans and committing the bank and his\npeople to the most significant change in its short history.\nBackground\nTayo was contemplating the future of the Bank towards the end of 2006.\nFounded only in 1990, it had grown rapidly to become a leading Nigerian bank\nthat was both highly profitable and the first Fitch AA- rated bank in the\ncountry. More importantly, it had become Nigeria\u2019s most respected corporate\nbank with an enviable reputation for ethical conduct, customer service,\nprofessionalism and innovation.\nWe are a team driven to deliver the utmost in customer service. We are\nsynonymous with innovation, building excellence and superior financial\nperformance and creating role models for society.\n\u2026 GTBank\u2019s mission statement\nHowever, the Nigerian Central Bank was sticking to the policy of encouraging\na severe consolidation of Nigeria\u2019s banks first announced publicly in June\n2004. Central Bank inspections had revealed an increasing number of weak\noperators. Of the 89 banks then operating in Nigeria, only 52 were deemed\nsound of which 11 were considered excellent. Over a period of 18 months, 14\nbanks were wound up and the remaining banks were urged to consolidate. In\nthe end, 25 banks emerged from the Nigerian Government\u2019s consolidation\npush. However, it was rumoured that the Central Bank wanted the remaining\ncompetitors to consolidate further to a figure between 8 and 12 so that each\nwould be ready and able to compete in the global economy. Already the asset\n3gap between Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and GTBank was large and there was a\nrisk that smaller banks would consolidate into one or more entities that would\nalso be larger than GTBank.\nIn a market consisting of a small number of much larger competitors, could\nGTBank continue in its niche positioning as a premiere corporate bank? Could\nit grow rapidly enough to remain a leading bank whilst maintaining its edge in\nservice, professionalism and ethics? If the Central Bank only wanted a limited\nnumber of banks, how rapidly must GTBank grow to be on that list? Should\nGTBank absorb smaller banks or would it become a target for take over itself?\nA History of Innovation and Service\nBy 1989, Tayo Aderinokun and Fola Adeola had become extremely\ndisillusioned with the Nigerian banks\u2019 traditional poor customer service, lack of\nprofessionalism and questionable ethics and opened GTBank in 1990. The\nfounders insisted that all its employees uphold the highest ethical and\nprofessional standards, a compelling proposition in the market at that time.\nThis made GTBank particularly attractive to many corporates and multi-\nnationals. Moreover, it changed the way banking was done in Nigeria:\n\u201cWhat you need to understand is that at that time, it could take four to six\nhours just to cash a cheque at a branch. It was a manual process that\nhad to be passed by seven different people. At each stage of the\nprocess, the cheque would enter a queue to be processed and you\nneeded to be there. The whole process was characterised by a lack of\ntrust between the bank and the customer; the tellers were behind cages\nand the branches were not desirable places to be. If you were lucky, a\nkind teller would give you an indication of where your cheque was in the\nqueue and how long until the next stage so you could go out of the bank\nand do some errands, grab lunch\u2026\u201d\nJoke Giwa, Former Head of Retail Banking Division, GTBank, Lagos,\n2006\nFor the first decade of the Bank\u2019s existence, all managers were personally\ntrained by the co-founders and given extensive mentoring in the Bank\u2019s\napproach to ethics and customer service as well as the professional-technical\ntools needed for day-to-day performance. Managers also worked in open\nplan offices \u2013 almost unheard of at the time in Nigeria. Service development,\nlending decisions and customer targeting were agreed through highly\ninteractive group meetings at branches and offices.\nThis was a real meritocracy and a tremendously exciting place to be. But\nmake no mistake about it, it was tough and our transparency gave\npeople no room to hide. One or two quarters of bad performance and\nyou might not keep your job.\n4Joke Giwa, Former Head of Retail Banking Division, GTBank, 2006\nThis combination of a unique market positioning for the bank and efficient\noperations, implemented by a team of motivated and talented professionals,\nhas generated tremendous growth for GTBank (see Figures 1 and 2). Its\ngrowth was also highly profitable: GTBank generated more profit as a\npercentage of income and by branch than any of its larger competitors:\nFigure 1: Comparative Financial Performances\n(Billions of Naira)\nBranc\nh\nNumb\ners\n200\n2\n200\n3\n200\n4\n200\n5\n200\n6\nUnion Bank 379 Operati\nng\nIncome\n39.6 44.0 48.2 58.9 66.6\nProfit 5.6 7.8 8.3 10.1 10.9\nFirst Bank of\nNigeria\n350 Operati\nng\nIncome\n41.7 45.1 45.1 49.5 61.2\nProfit 5.1 13.4 14.1 15.1 19.8\nZenith Bank 142 Operati\nng\nIncome\n12.1 17.8 23.9 34.9 58.2\nProfit 3.5 4.4 5.2 7.1 11.5\nGuaranty\nTrust Bank\n83 Operati\nng\nIncome\n11.2 16.7 18.9 23.8 32.0\n5Figure 1: Comparative Financial Performances\n(Billions of Naira)\nProfit 3.3 3.3 4.1 5.3 10.0\n6Despite its undoubted quality, GTB was losing ground to rivals. During the\nperiod of consolidation, traditional banks had swallowed up weaker rivals and\nNigeria\u2019s other successful \u201cchallenger\u201d brand, Zenith Bank was growing even\nfaster \u2013 organically and by acquisition.\nFigure 2: Assets of Leading Nigerian Banks\n(Billions of Naira)\n2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nUnion Bank 300.0 366.7 418.7 550.1 667.8\nFirst Bank of\nNigeria\n266.4 320.6 312.5 377.5 538.1\nZenith Bank 92.6 112.5 193.3 329.7 608.5\nGuaranty Trust\nBank\n65.0 90.2 133.8 167.0 343.2\nIt was the Central Bank\u2019s decision to raise capital requirements dramatically\nthat had sparked this wave of rapid consolidation. Amongst the major Nigerian\nbanks, there was only a handful that did not merge, GTBank being one of\nthem.\nWe started out with the intention of being one of the top three banks. We\nhave grown significantly in terms of balance sheet and also in terms of\ncapital, the size of our branch network and customer acquisition. But the\nplaying field has changed now because the consolidation of so many\nbanks \u2013 90 or so fragmented banks have been transformed into 25\nconsolidated entities. \u2026 We considered some acquisitions but failed to\nfind a bank of sufficient quality or one that had values aligned to ours. So\nwe decided to remain as GTBank.\nTayo Aderinokun, CEO of GTBank, 2006\nInstead of growing by acquisition, GTBank raised money in capital markets,\nexceeded the new Central Bank capital requirements and used some of the\n7money it raised to invest in strongly in Retail Banking. Despite its excellent\nperformance to date and its strong national reputation, GTBank faces a\nnumber of major business challenges from within the Nigerian business\nenvironment. They are outlined below through a PESTE analysis:\nPESTE Analysis\n1. Political\nNigerian bankers and industrialists generally believe that the consolidation to\n25 banks represented a compromise.\nThere is a projection that maybe in the next five years there will\nbe about 15 banks in Nigeria or perhaps 18 to 20 at the very\nmost.\nJacobs Ajekigbe, Managing Director, First Bank, Lagos, 2006\nAmongst the leaders of the Nigerian banking system, and their corporate\ncustomers, there is universal recognition of the political progress being made\nin Nigeria. Continued stability and progress with respect to governance,\ntransparency and the market reform is seen as vital to the successful\ntransformation of banking in Nigeria.\n2. Economic and Social\nThe growth of national oil revenues, vital for Government finances, is not seen\nas the key engine to future banking success. Rather, it is the continued growth\nof the middle class and the attendant boom in personal lending, mortgages,\ncredit cards and long term savings products that will generate much of the\nfuture potential. The growth of the middle class in the major Nigerian cities\nhas meant that banks, once the exclusive preserve of the wealthy, are now\nbecoming more accessible to ordinary consumers:\nPreviously, people used to beg to open accounts. Now banks\nare begging customers to open accounts. Those that do not\nhave accounts are being encouraged to open an account. We\nhave about 350 branches in the country yet this density is still\nlow\u2026if you go to the fringes, you won\u2019t see any.\nJacobs Ajekigbe, MD of First Bank, Lagos, 2006.\n83. New Technology\nGTBank officials claim that in the past five years alone, 21 million people have\nacquired mobile phones. The internet is becoming more available and\ncompanies are beginning to offer call centres: something common in the more\neconomically developed markets. In banking, GTBank is a path finder in\noffering call centre facilities and services. ATMs have also been recently\nintroduced; many companies offer them on site so that their staff need not\nqueue at local bank branches.\n4. The Competitive Environment\nPerhaps the most striking environmental factor facing GTBank is increasing\ncompetition. When GTBank commenced operations, its unique customer\nservice culture and professionalism was unprecedented in the industry and\nset the bank apart. However, competition is fast eroding that gap. The\nconsolidation of banks has created a basis for much stronger competition and,\nat the same time, the larger, older banks still have some competitive\nadvantages, particularly on cost grounds due to their scale.\nFirst Bank has the balance sheet size and the cost of funds\n[advantage] because they are a 100 year old bank. ... So if I am\nable to give you money at 15%, they could probably do 12%\nbecause of their cost base advantage.\nAdetola Owalabi, Manager Commercial Banking Group \u2013\nAutomobile Division, GTBank, 2006.\nConsolidation, acquisition and reaching a sustainable size are the strategies\nbeing deployed by most major competitors:\nWhat the government did was really change the competitive market.\nFirst Bank really had the size prior to legislation, now every major bank is\nabout our size so we had to craft a plan so that we can maintain our\ncompetitive edge. We have about 350 branches and we have a plan to\nreach 500 branches by 2008.\nJacobs Ajekigbe, MD of First Bank, 2006\nAccording to Jacobs Ajekigbe\u2019s market analysis, what seems to be emerging\nare three categories of banks: the top 10 players, the middle seven and the\nbottom eight who may struggle to survive in the mid-term.\n9Using a SWOT analysis, GTBank\u2019s competitive market position can be\nsummarized.\nSWOT Analysis of GTBank\n1. Strengths\n1.1 Corporate lending expertise and reputation\nAt the core of GTBank\u2019s business is its corporate lending expertise, a function\nof its people and professionalism. This was the point of departure for the\norganization originally and the essence of its formidable reputation built over\nthe years. It prides itself on extraordinary service levels.\nWhat really sets them apart is their speed of execution. This is especially\ntrue when it comes to processing credit. I would say that once a decision\nhas been made, GTBank is probably one of the premium banks that will\ncome out with the credit facilities for you fastest.\nDavid Nahata, Group Financial Director - Tolaram Group (diversified\nindustrial conglomerate), Lagos, 2006.\nGTBank\u2019s reputation is founded upon the quality and professionalism of its\nstaffers. The sentiments expressed by Adetola Owalabi of GTBank below\nhave been endorsed by numerous customers:\nIn terms of knowledge, we still have that edge over the market so you\nwork the market. When you understand the world market for automobiles\nand the demand for steel, for instance, you understand how these prices\naffect the steel industry in Nigeria. All these sort of things \u2013 we still have\nthat edge and other people cannot easily catch up with us.\nAdetola Owalabi, Manager Commercial Banking \u2013 Automobile\nDivision, GTBank, 2006.\nIn 2006, GTBank was accredited with ISO 9001, the international standards\norganisation quality mark for service providers. It was the first Nigerian bank\nso accredited and it recently became the first Nigerian bank to list on the\nLondon Stock Exchange when it raised $750 million through the issuance of a\nGlobal Depositary Receipt.\n10\n1.2 Stronger Capitalisation\nPrior to raising more money from the capital markets during 2005, GTBank\nhad limits in respect to how much of a large company\u2019s business it could\naccommodate. A banking regulation, termed the \u201cOne Obligor Concept\u201d,\nprevented banks from lending an amount more than 33% of its capital base to\nany one customer. This limited the share of business GTBank could achieve\nwith large clients, even where they [the customer] were keen to give GTBank\nmore of their business.\n[Guaranty Trust Bank\u2019s] service delivery is quite excellent. We need a\nbank like GTBank because they understand issues and they do come\nand assist. [However], there is a limit as to what they can lend because of\none obligor. The size of GTBank cannot satisfy the Dangote Group.\nHowever, if GTBank could do what I need, I would give the majority of my\nbusiness to them.\nAliko Dangote, President and Chief Executive, the Dangote Group,\nLagos, Nigeria, 2004.\nThe stronger capital base permits GTBank to increase its share of business\nwith core corporate customers. However, the much larger capital base of its\nlarger competitors allows them to lend an even larger share of a corporate\ncustomer\u2019s total needs and establish more of a total banking solution.\n1.3 High Commercial Rating and Ethical Stance\nGTBank was rated by the international rating agencies Fitch and Standard &\nPoor\u2019s, as well as Nigeria\u2019s foremost rating agency Augusto & Co, as the best\nof any Nigerian bank during 2006. Strong ratings make the Bank attractive to\ncustomers, particularly corporate customers and enhance its reputation.\nEqually, the founders\u2019 uncompromising views on ethics are a core part of the\nBank\u2019s brand reputation. Ethics set the tone for how the Bank wishes to deal\nwith customers - with transparency and sensible charges \u2013 which promotes\nopportunities for margin growth and improved customer relationships.\nIn the early years, ethics was very clear to us as the way forward. If we\nare ethical, other people will easily see this and, for us, ethics delves\nsignificantly into morality and our relationship with our customer. At all\ntimes we need to be fair. We charge a fair price for what we do and what\nwe say to them must be clear so there is no argument and no\nmisunderstanding.\nFola Adeola, Co-founder of GTBank, 2004.\n11\n2. Weakness\nWhilst the Bank has great strengths, it is suited particularly for corporate\nbanking; the PESTE analysis reveals how that creates some weaknesses:\n2.1 Weak presence in the fastest growing market sectors\nGTBank is a niche brand, strong in the corporate sector that is enjoying\n\u201caverage\u201d growth. It is underdeveloped in Government and retail banking, both\nof which are large, growing markets.\nThe Bank has always refused to deal with clients and or transactions that\nfailed to meet the ethical standard required of the Bank (to be a role model for\nNigerian society). In Nigeria, this excluded it from large sectors of Government\nand some foreign exchange transactions. Guaranty Trust Bank did not even\ncreate a public sector business unit until 1998 and it acknowledges that its\nactivities are limited to an ethical niche when it suits Government officials to\nmake a public statement.\nWe were clear about the profile of the customer that we wanted to do\nbusiness with \u2013 and if that customer did not meet that profile, we\nrefused to work with them.\nFola Adeola, Co-founder of GTBank, Lagos, 2004.\nPotentially, the business area ripe for explosive growth is retail with the\nrapidly-expanding middle class in Nigeria. This sector is under-served with\nbanks and banking services. However, the GTBank brand and proposition are\nfinely-tuned for its corporate customers.\n2.2 Corporate brand image irrelevant to consumers\nThe main pillars of GTBank\u2019s reputation, professionalism, innovation, service\nand ethics are particularly valued by corporate clients but have perhaps less\nsaliency amongst ordinary consumers and the new, rising middle class. Its\nimage lacks some attributes of most consumer brands - excitement,\nbelonging, fun and ubiquity.\n2.3 Competitors have stronger distribution\nIts major competitors have more extensive branch networks and the number\nof branches is still strongly deterministic of a bank\u2019s ability to attract and retain\ndeposits from their customers, this particularly true for the retail sector.\n12\nToday, we can grow 20 branches a year comfortably. If we are a bit more\naggressive, we could go up to about 30.\nTayo Aderinokun, CEO of GTBank, 2006.\nEqually, GTBank has always built high quality, attractive branches\ncommensurate with its policies on improving the customer experience and\nimage as a premium service provider. Zenith Bank, however, has tended to\nbuild fit-for-purpose branches that were less expensive to put up and this has\nenabled it to expand its network more quickly. GTBank\u2019s design policy of its\nbranches has been developed to cater more for its corporate clients but may\nnow be considered over-engineered for the retail market and the rapid\nexpansion of branches which is needed to fuel this expansion through market\npenetration.\n2.4 Competitors are narrowing the quality gap\nThe rapid pace of growth is putting severe pressures on the senior\nmanagement at GTBank to maintain its greatest strength - the ability to\ndevelop the most professional bankers in Nigeria:\nWhen you have to expand very rapidly in a very short period, you need\nsenior and middle management to plug the gaps, so over the last two\nyears, we have had to bring in new people who do not necessarily share\nour own vision: people who were essentially formed in their own ways. I\nwould say that we have had very mixed results in recent times. I would\nsay that the attrition rate is now much, much higher than it was.\nWe have just started a two to three week induction or orientation\nprogramme for middle level staff. We just bring them in and try and show\nthem our philosophy, this is how we work. These are the \u2018does and\ndon\u2019ts\u2019. So, maybe going forward we will have a better success rate at\nintroducing new people into our companies.\nWe ensure that the entry level people, the base level that form the bulk of\nthe staff in any branch, are people that have gone through our system\nwith our training people. So in a branch there are maybe 10 to 20 people\nwho are entry level. However, it is the five or six people above the entry\nlevel reporting to the branch manager who make the main decisions \u2013\nthis is where the problem is.\nTayo Aderinokun, CEO GTBank, 2006.\nThese sentiments are also echoed by the Deputy Managing Director of\nGTBank:\n13\nCulture dilution\u2026.and human capital are probably the biggest challenges\nof the growth strategy that we have gone into. I think the challenge lies in\nthree areas. At the top there is a challenge because the sphere of\ninfluence of the guys who run the organisation starts to dwindle because\n[GTBank is] getting bigger. In the middle there is a challenge ... if you\nbring people in from outside. At the base level, even after four months of\nour training, if the foundation and all the schooling have not been properly\ndone and peoples\u2019 value system has been so distorted through\nsecondary school to university, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to clean it all up\nin four months. So at all three levels, I see a challenge for the bank.\nSegun Agbaje, Deputy MD of GTBank, Lagos, 2006.\n3. Opportunities\n3.1 Retail banking in Nigeria\nRetail banking is set to be a growth sector and offers GTBank a lower cost\npool of money. The view of the Bank is that long-term, steady deposits can be\nbrought in at lower cost than current sources of funds, allowing the bank to\nincrease its margins and the opportunity to match the pricing of larger, more\nestablished banks. Of course, this is predicated on a view that consumer\ndeposits are dynamically stable, have a low costs-to-serve and are brought in\nat an affordable cost of customer acquisition.\nAs new people enter the banking system, who will be able to develop the\noptimal cost model to serve them appropriately as continual branch expansion\nis costly?\n3.2 Lowering costs through technology\nCoincident with the rise of the middle class in the cities, there is an explosion\nin the uptake of new technology. The middle class is going online:\nIn Nigeria there are 21 million mobile phones. Five years ago there were\nnone. There are alternative channels. Internet banking is becoming much\nmore significant.\nTayo Aderinokun, CEO of GTBank, 2006.\nTechnology may also hold the answer to the trade off between investment in\nnew branches and gaining new accounts at GTBank:\nWe see our [telephone] contact centre as a mechanism for\naccelerating our retail bank business. We have invested about $5\nmillion in our CRM systems and it is state of the art. No other bank in\n14\nNigeria has our ability to integrate our customer data and provide real\ntime responses to our customers\u2019 enquiries and problems.\nTayo Aderinokun, CEO of GTBank, 2006.\n3.3 Building share of corporate banking\nConsolidation and mergers will naturally create tensions and conflicts of\ninterests with corporate clients in Nigeria; where relationship teams change,\nthere are opportunities for organically growing organisations, such as\nGTBank, to capture disgruntled clients:\nGTBank is now a 70% supplier of funds for us. It is a relationship that we\nhave had over so many years but it really cemented some time last year\nwhen we were able to let GTBank take a big chunk [of our business].\nThat, coupled with the capacity to do it in terms of the change in the\nregulatory cap on borrowing [one obligor], GTBank saw as an opportunity\nto take the risk. I would say that GTBank was foresighted enough to see\nthe opportunities opening up generally. It was around the time when the\nbanking sector itself was in turmoil because of the new banking\nregulations that were brought in. Most of the banks really did not have\ntheir house in order.\nDavid Nahata, Group Financial Director \u2013 Tolaram Group, Lagos, 2006.\n4. Threats\n4.1 Consolidation may change GTBank\u2019s successful strategy\nWill Central Bank policy force GTBank to grow quickly or merge with another\nbank with complementary market strengths? Is Tayo Aderinokun\u2019s vision to be\nthe third largest bank in Nigeria related to intuition or a canny understanding\nof the need to be that size when there will be only a handful of banks\nremaining?\nThe original plan of the Nigerian Government was to have not more than\n8 banks. However, they compromised at 25. There will always be key\nplayers and there will be middle players; however, the laggards are going\nto get wiped out by competition. People only want to be associated with\nsuccess so the banks that aggregated together were the weaker banks\nso consumers still will not so willingly put their money there.\nLeke Alder, Managing Director of GTBank\u2019s advertising agency, Lagos,\n2006\n15\nThe challenge faced by GTBank due to consolidation of the banking sector as\nthe industry moves slowly but progressively towards the magic number \u201ceight\u201d\nis considerable. Currently, four banks are bigger than GTBank and there are\nno foreign banks operating at any scale in Nigeria. With growing oil revenues,\na growing middle class and an overall population of 130 million, an entry\nstrategy by a big foreign bank should not be excluded from any long term\nmarketing plan. This would leave only three places against which GTBank\nmust compete with all the other banks that have merged in order to make the\nultimate \u201ccut off\u201d in any further round of consolidation.\n4.2 GTBank\u2019s service advantage is narrowing\nWhen it was launched, GTBank redefined the concept of service in Nigerian\nbanking and immediately established a noticeable gap to competitors. Over\nthe years, however, other banks have learnt from it and imitated its successful\nservice innovations.\nThe competitive gap is not as strong as it could be \u2013 because we are not\ndoing anything radically different and because a lot of people have left\nhere who know the system. They are running other banks and are doing\nthe same thing. The challenge of the next three to five years is to\ndetermine what that competitive advantage is going to be. It needs to be\npowerful enough to drive the internal organisation and important enough\nto drive the externals. The competitive advantage is still reputation, doing\nthings properly and ethically.\nSegun Agbaje, Deputy MD of GTBank, Lagos, 2006.\nProviding good service in the competitive context of 1990 was revolutionary\nbut as competitors learn from GTBank, the gap narrows:\nGTBank is a class brand that has become an icon: a generalised icon, a\nstandard icon. So all those things that it dazzled the environment with\nhave now become commoditised. Architecture is commoditised. Service\ncommoditised, even innovation in terms of service offering is being\ncommoditised.\nLeke Alder, MD of Alders Advertising, Lagos, 2006.\nCan the bank still innovate with respect to service and maintain that edge\nversus increasingly professional competitors as the much larger organization\nit has now become?\n16\n4.3 Stalling reforms\nMuch of the PESTE and SWOT analyses assumes the continued growth of\nthe middle class which may depend on continuing political reform, anti-\ncorruption policies and economic liberalisation. Parliament's decision not to\nchange the constitution to allow a third presidential term for Olusegun\nObasanjo and the subsequent election in 2007 is seen by some as an\nindicator of the permanency of the reforms begun by President Obasanjo in\n1999. Nonetheless, political risk can never be ignored.\nThe Challenges of Retail Banking at GTBank\nBecoming a major player in retail is a costly proposition and the Bank needs\nto consider seven areas of its retail marketing strategy:\n1. Branch Network\nAt the time of writing, GTBank had 100 branches and the estimated capacity\nto build 30 branches per annum. Its largest competitors have about 350\nbranches and, at this rate of growth, it would only close that gap after a\ndecade, assuming the current market leaders do not make further acquisitions\nor invest in their own branch-building spree. GTBank branches are top quality\nso they are generally more costly to construct than competitors.\nWe can hit 250 branches in the far future, still less than competitors and\nthat number only allows them to serve some one million customers each.\nWe wish to have about 1 million customers within a year\u2026\u2026and up to 5\nmillion in the longer term.\nKolapo Omidire, Director of Retail Banking at GTBank, Lagos, 2006.\n2. Marketing Promotion\nRetail banking requires consumer, mass marketing - a step-change from the\nbusiness to business relationship marketing of corporate banking. GTBank\nchanged its advertising agency, rebranded with a more consumer-oriented\nlook and embarked upon unprecedented investments in creating consumer\nawareness during 2006.\nYou can see that our colours are now much brighter, it\u2019s louder\u2026..we are\nof the belief that going into the market, we need to be much more visible\nand vibrant. The former colour and logo were much more subdued and\ninconspicuous\u2026\u2026 we didn\u2019t need to be that visible because we were\noperating at the high end of the market. We went to our customers. In\nthose days, you did not drive by and stop to go into the bank. We are now\n17\ngoing down market and we felt the need for change\u2026.. this is essentially\nthe reason for our investment in the rebranding. It is the largest\nadvertising spend that we have considered in the history of the bank. This\ncampaign will cost us about $5m in total over a one year to 18 month\nperiod. So it\u2019s up there with our CRM technology investment\u2026.. these\nare the two most significant investments we have made in our history.\nTayo Aderinokun, CEO of GTBank, 2006\nFigure 3: GTBank: A Changing Corporate Identify\nLaunch Identity (1990) New identity (2006)\nTo put this investment in advertising in perspective, prior to consolidation\nGTBank spent just under $400,000 on advertising in 2003, about as much as\nits larger competitors. The investment of $5 million represents a complete\nbreak with the past - can it afford to maintain this level and match the\nspending of much larger rivals over time?\n3. Brand Positioning and Message\nThe real challenge for the GTBank brand is to appeal to new people without\ndetracting from its professional, ethical and service-orientated reputation built\nover almost 20 years of hard work.\nLeke Alder, Managing Director of the advertising agency partnering with\nGTBank throughout the rebranding period, recommended leveraging the\ncreative execution on \u201cowning the colour orange in Nigeria\u201d:\nDefine the entity. Define the values. Use these values to dominate the\nenvironment visually and make it palatable. Orange Rules because we\nwant to promote a set of rules and values that capture the essence of\n18\nGTBank that are natural to the company and that customers naturally\nidentify with GTBank.\nLeke Alder, MD Alders Advertising, Lagos, 2006.\nIf Orange is the highly visible mnemonic, then the content has had to\ntranscend markets by talking to the features and benefits that GTBank is most\nproud of - its values, ethical stance and professional services . An advertising\ncampaign (Orange Rules) was developed and a set of eight adverts, each\ndescribing an aspect of GTBank\u2019s approach to business, was created. The\ncampaign is being rolled out sequentially to create a sense of build,\nmomentum and newsworthiness. The main medium for the \u2018Orange Rules\u2019\nadverts currently is posters in prime sites around Lagos and other major\nNigerian cities. These posters began to appear after a very successful teaser\ncampaign that consisted of the appearance of five feet square, orange boxes\nstrategically placed on key artery roads and duel carriageways around Lagos\nthat simply had a big question mark to create initial interest! A sample of an\nadvertisement from the poster campaign is included below in figure 4. It is\ncommunicating the innovation \u2018rule\u2019 of the bank. The other seven orange\n\u2018rules\u2019 are described below and form the backbone of the new campaign in\nAppendix 1:\nFigure 4: A Sample Advert of GTBank\u2019s Campaign\n19\n4. People and Processes\nPerhaps the most difficult challenge facing the Bank is the cultural change as\nit moves to a mass market brand:\nGiven that we were a [corporate] bank, it means we had a certain culture\nand a certain way of servicing people, a certain type of client base that\nwe are attracted to. Now going into retail, we have to start to think\ndifferently\u2026. that is why we have adopted all these colours into the logo\nand are trying to put in new processes. [We are] going from more intimate\ntype banking to more process-driven banking. Internally, trying to get\npeople to change and accept servicing a different type of customer base\nhas not been easy. There are people who liked to service the type of\nclient base that they had before.\nNow, if you are trying to get to a million customers, it means that even\nsegmentation is changing..... Some of our people who have moved into\nretail probably tried to do relationship management, so they now need to\nchange their thinking. The orientation and the prevailing culture within\nthe organisation is predominantly relationship management driven. So\nthat needs to change and you have to let people get used to that.\nSegun Agbaje, Deputy MD of GTBank, 2006.\nThe challenge is not only about people\u2019s orientation or \u201cmind-set\u201d, but also the\ntop management must now manage two distinctive business models.\nWe are trying to create two banks within one. In developing a retail type\nof division from essentially a corporate bank, you are trying to put into\nthe heads of the account managers that this business is not a relationship\ntype of business but one sustained by CRM, a call centre and alternative\ndelivery channels according to the type of business - so you try to\nsegment. With our high growth strategy, it also means another major\nchallenge internally. I\u2019m not sure that the processes have grown as\nquickly as they might have, so the whole challenge of trying to keep the\nprocesses in line with the internal growth and keep the level of service\nand intimacy that the corporate customers are used to I think might be\none of our greatest challenges.\nSegun Agbaje, Deputy MD of GTBank, 2006.\nRunning two business models simultaneously presents a number of\nchallenges in terms of allocating investment between the businesses,\nchoosing appropriate leaders for each to their markets (rather than just in the\n20\ncorporate style) and managing people from two units working in the same\nbranches.\n5. Segmentation - Customer Acquisition Strategy\nAttracting up to a million new customers through a relatively small branch\nnetwork is the biggest marketing challenge for the Bank. In addition, national\ncredit agencies do not yet exist in Nigeria so it is difficult to assess the credit-\nworthiness of people to whom the Bank lends money - this adds substantial\nrisk to the business.\nTo establish a foothold in retail, GTBank will first leverage its long-standing\ncorporate relationships by extending retail banking services to customers\u2019\nemployees:\nWe have gone from about 30,000 or 40,000 accounts to about 400,000 in\nrecord time. And most of that has been from taking the salaried\nemployee accounts from our major corporate customers that we have\nalways banked. That was a part of the business that we had traditionally\nalways shied away from. So we have created clusters. This really is our\nforte and is the safest way to go in and to do consumer loans as well. You\ncan tie it to salary accounts and you can tie it to terminal benefits.\nSegun Agbaje, Deputy MD of GTBank, 2006.\nFigure 5: GTBank\u2019s in-company services at Nigerian Breweries\nA GTBank Branch Office\nat Nigerian Breweries\nA GTBank ATM on the Nigerian Breweries\nsite\n21\nGTBank set up an ATM and branch office on site and they are more\nwelcoming of new retail clients. It is leveraging a good 10 year\ncommercial relationship. Before GTBank came on board as a retail bank,\nUBA (United Bank of Africa) were quite close physically. So when the\ncompany (Nigerian Brewery) took on new employees, as part of their\norientation we contacted the closest local bank which was UBA as\nsalaries are automatically paid into the employee\u2019s bank account. So our\nrelationship was originally with UBA for salary payment. Some staff have\nchanged to GTBank as there is a cash office downstairs as well as an\nATM. This may facilitate this migration towards GTBank from UBA.\nOlaoye Niyi, Treasury Manager \u2013 Nigerian Breweries, Lagos, 2006.\nExtending services to managers and employees in long-standing corporate\naccounts is a novel segmentation that is cost-effective and provides the Bank\nwith a proxy for credit checking.\n6. New Technology\nRecognising the difficulties in moving from a narrow corporate customer base\nto managing millions of small accounts, the Bank has invested in the\ntechnology to provide low-cost, mass-market banking - CRM is the term they\nhave used for it. GTBank is the first bank in Nigeria to deploy sophisticated\nOracle CRM solutions and expects it to overcome the limitations of its branch\nnetwork and high cost, customer service mentality.\nWe have set a target of getting 1 million customers within a year.\nTowards this end, we have set up mobile banking, internet banking and\ncards in order to get to where we want to be. In the new millennium,\nbricks and mortar are not the exclusive way to serve customers. In fact, it\nis not recommended to invest too much in bricks and mortar. You still\nneed some branches of course as people still need to deal with other\nhuman beings on a face to face basis in their banking transactions from\ntime to time. First Bank \u2013 one of the biggest banks in the country - has\nclose to 350 branches. Today, with less than 100 branches, we are half\ntheir size in terms of balance sheet. So, it suggests that, in order to be big\nor bigger than them, we need to open a further 100 to 150 branches. The\nrest we will do with technology - mobile banking, ATMs, etc.\nWe have invested in Oracle which will allow systems integration and real-\ntime communications much more effectively. You service a lot more\ncustomers without really seeing them. In reality, if we did not have\nOracle\/CRM, we would need twice the work force to service the\ncustomers that we have today. Investment of about $ 5 million in this\nsystem is huge for the Bank.\nTayo Aderinokun, CEO of GTBank, 2006\n22\n7. Product and Systems Innovation\nThe Bank has been investing in sophisticated new products and making them\navailable 24\/7 through online and call centre channels. To support this, the\nbank launched GT Connect, West Africa\u2019s first 24\/7 total banking solution in\nSeptember 2006:\nFigure 6: GTBank\u2019s recently opened Contact Centre in Lagos\nGuaranty Trust Bank plc has launched its new Contact Centre which\nis the first fully interactive, self service facility of its kind by any\nfinancial services institution in the West African sub-region.\nThe new Contact Centre is a total banking solution, capable of\nproviding customers and prospective clients with instant service via\nthe telephone. Like its internet banking and web site facilities, the\nGTBank Contact Centre is accessible from anywhere in the world\nand open for business 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even on\npublic holidays.\nGTBank press release, Sept 2006\nIn 2006, GT Max was introduced: a cash management solution for individuals\nand smaller companies giving them current account functionality that is\ninterest-bearing and charge-free. The new service targets \u201ceconomically\nactive citizens and trading entities like sole proprietors, clubs and\nassociations, partnerships, cooperative societies, limited liability companies\nand other commercial enterprises\u201d. It is offered in three varieties (Silver, Gold\nand Platinum), each with unique benefits. All offer customised cheque books,\nmonthly account statements via email and free access to all alternative\nchannels and e-banking services of the Guaranty Trust Bank e.g. internet,\ntelephone and SMS banking, access to all InterSwitch networked automated\nteller machines (ATM and all other electronic notification services provided by\nthe Bank).\n23\nSummary and Questions for Discussion\nGTBank represents a significant success of business strategy and marketing\nexecution. Founded by committed directors to reinvent Nigerian banking, it is\na business dedicated to professionalism and ethical banking targeted at\ncorporate customers. It has a strong and coherent brand that integrates\npeople, values, processes and branches, to deliver its promise and provide a\ncommensurate customer experience. GTBank occupies a profitable segment\nof the market, but market growth is now within the retail segment.\nConsolidation of the Nigerian banking has already eliminated almost 70% of\nthe banking brand names, and subsequent consolidation may see a similar\nreduction amongst existing banks. In order to ensure its survival, and\ntherefore its ability to complete its founding vision, GTBank must extend from\nits core business of corporate banking and become a leading participant in the\nemerging Retail segment where its great brand strengths are perhaps less\nsalient and obvious. The Bank is convinced that the its reputation is relevant\nin the new segments: ethics, professionalism, innovation, great service and\nmodernity. The challenge is to augment them with consumer relevant values\n(excitement, belonging, accessible) and deliver the brand experience to a\nmuch broader and potentially less financially sophisticated target audience.\nTayo is asked to approve continued investments to expand physical presence,\ninvest in mass media communications, develop new channels and promote a\nmore consumer-friendly image. This represents unprecedented investments\nfor a more uncertain return than from its core corporate customers. At the\nsame time, its competitors are reducing the gap to GTBank\u2019s service quality in\nthe core corporate segment.\nWhat would you do if you were in Tayo\u2019s position?
