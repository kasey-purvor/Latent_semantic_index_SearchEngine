Those on the negative side argue that online relationships or \nwhat are also often referred to as \u2018weak\u2019 ties are not psychologically beneficial, and \ntake important time away from more psychologically healthy offline relationships. \nThose who take the more positive stance do so because they believe that the internet \nprovides a space for people to feel freer to express themselves without the usual harsh \njudgement that can be experienced in face-to-face settings. Of course, both sides have \nthere merit and the debate should not be bifurcated. This paper will highlight the pros \nand cons of online relating. The view taken here, however, is that in many ways \ncyberspace has created new opportunities for people to feel empowered and has \nopened up new and fulfilling opportunities to relate to others.  \n To begin with this paper outlines early theories (which are still embraced by \nsome theorists today) that contend that online relating can be an impersonal and \nnegative experience. These theories emphasise what is lacking online compared to \nface-to-face settings. \n \n1. Online relating: Theories that emphasize the negative aspects \n \n1.1 Social Presence Theory and Social Context Cues Theory \n \n 3 \n\u2018Social Presence Theory\u2019 and \u2018Social Context Cues Theory\u2019 although first \ndevised to explain interactions via teleconferencing, were two of the first theories to \nbe applied to CMC (Computer mediated communication). These theories point out \nthat online, due to fewer non-verbal and paralinguistic cues, there is an extremely low \nfeeling of social presence; that is, an individual\u2019s self-perception is reduced and \ndeindividuation is encouraged. Those who have applied this theory have argued that \nas social presence declines communication becomes more impersonal (Hiltz, Johnson, \nand Turoff, 1986; Short, Williams, and Christie, 1976; Sproull and Kiesler, 1986). In \nthe absence of typical social context cues, it is said that communication can become \nincreasingly uninhibited and aggressive (e.g., as evident in flaming). In contrast, these \ntheorists argued that an increase in the amount of personal information available will \nlead to greater positive regard. According to this view, online relating is a more \nnegative and impersonal experience compared to face-to-face. Cyberspace is a space \nwhich fosters deceit, abusive and sometime even harassment. As will be highlighted \nin this chapter, empirical evidence supports some of these theorists\u2019 claims. \n \n1.2 Media Richness Theory \n\u2018Media Richness Theory\u2019 takes a similar stance to \u2018Social Presence Theory\u2019 \nand \u2018Social Context Cues Theory\u2019 in that it examines what CMC lacks compared to \nface-to-face. This theory contends that individuals are driven to overcome \nequivocality and uncertainty. Media Richness Theory was originally applied to \ncommunication within organisations but has since been applied to other types of \nrelationships. Those who applied it to organisations have suggested that different \ntypes of media typically work better for certain tasks. As explained by Daft and \nLengel (1986): \n 4 \nInformation richness is defined as the ability of information to change \nunderstanding within a time interval. Communication transactions that can \novercome different frames of reference or clarify ambiguous issues to change \nunderstanding in a timely manner are considered rich. Communications that \nrequire a long time to enable understanding or that cannot overcome different \nperspectives are lower in richness. (p. 560) \nThe types of criteria that Daft and Lengel (1986) used to define media richness \ninclude: a) availability of instant feedback; b) capacity of the medium to transmit \nmultiple cues; c) the use of \u2018natural language\u2019, and d) the personal focus of the \nmedium. According to this theory, face-to-face communication is the richest type of \nmedia as is provides immediate feedback and utilises more channels. In contrast, \nCMC is far less rich as it lacks many of the important features of face-to-face and \nphone communication. In line with the theories described above, Media Richness \nTheory suggests that online relating can be far less personal than face-to-face. \n \n2. Online relating: Theories that emphasize the positive aspects \n \n Not all theorists believe that leaner media provides an impoverished \nenvironment (see Whitty and Carr 2006a for a more in-depth discussion). For \nexample, Suler (2004) and Joinson (2001) have argued that people can be more honest \nand open about themselves in cyberspace. Similarly, Walther, Slovacek and Tidwell \n(2001) have argued that with time many of the problems associated with the lack of \ncues online can be overcome. McKenna and colleagues have proposed that the lack of \nsocial presence provides individuals with more opportunities to present aspects of \nthemselves that they do not feel comfortable with displaying in ordinary face-to-face \n 5 \nconversations (McKenna & Bargh, 1998, 2000; McKenna, Green, & Gleason, 2002). \nWhitty (2003a, 2004) has found that individuals are able to flirt online by substituting \ntranslating traditional offline non-verbal cues into text. This paper now turns to \nexamine each of these theorists\u2019 claims in more detail. As will be elucidated, these \ntheorists do note some of the negative features of online relating, however, their \nemphasis is on the more positive and empowering aspects. \n \n2.1 \u2018Disinhibition effect\u2019 \n The \u2018disinhibition effect\u2019 purports that online communication is a double-\nedged sword. This effect explained by Suler (2004), occurs when people are able to be \nmore anonymous, which is typically more achievable in online settings than in face-\nto-face. According to some theorists, when one is more anonymous they feel freer to \nbe more emotionally honest and open and self-disclose more personal information \nabout themselves (Joinson, 2001). This can feel liberating and empowering. The most \nliberating form of \u2018disinhibiton\u2019 Suler (2004) refers to as \u2018Benign disinhibition\u2019. This \nis where people reveal secrets, emotions or their fears. Moreover, they sometimes \ncarry out unusual acts of kindness or generosity. \n Not all self-disclosure is empowering. Suler (2004) has argued that sometimes \npeople online are extremely rude or angry. Some will seek out material online that \nthey would not have otherwise have sought out (e.g., violent pornography). Suler \nnames this \u2018toxic disinhibition\u2019. \n  \n2.2 Hyperpersonal Theory \nWalther et al.\u2019s (2001) \u2018hyperpersonal theory\u2019 has garnered enthusiastic \nsupport. \u2018Hyperpersonal Theory\u2019 explains that the problems associated with an \n 6 \nabsence of social cues and social presence online can be overcome. Moreover, people \ncan potentially develop closer relationships more quickly in an online setting. As \nWalther et al. (2001) state: \u201cCMC users sometimes experience intimacy, affection, \nand interpersonal assessments of their partners that exceed those occurring in parallel \nFTF activities or alternative CMC contexts\u201d (p. 109). Net friends and lovers can \nsometimes offer greater emotional support and empathy compared to offline social \nnetworks. \nWalther and his colleagues (Walther, 1996; Walther et al., 2001) have \nexplained that people can be quite strategic with their self presentations. On the \ninternet individuals can often take their time at deciding what to communicate \n(especially in asynchronous forms of communication, such as email). This means that \nthey have time to reflect on what they are trying to communicate and how they \npresent themselves.  \nWhen a person has time to decide how to present themselves and are visually \nanonymous, they are able to create a false or exaggerated depiction of who they really \nare. Often individuals will elect to present themselves in the most positive light. Being \nstrategic can lead to more intimate and close relationships. However, in turn, it can \nalso lead to idealisation. Seeing someone for better than who they really are is not \nalways the most psychologically healthy way to relate.  \nIt is critical to understand, according to this hyperpersonal communication \nframework, displays of online affiliative behaviours depend on whether the individual \nanticipates a long-term or short-term commitment with their online partner. Moreover, \nthe dynamics change if a real image is presented to the person one is communicating \nwith. Walther et al. (2001) found that the presence of a photograph prior to and during \nCMC had a positive effect on intimacy\/affection and social attractiveness for short-\n 7 \nterm CMC partners. Moreover, CMC partners who met online felt less \nintimacy\/affection and social attraction once a photograph was introduced compared \nto individuals with long-term CMC partners who never saw each other\u2019s picture. \nWhat this suggests is that when we consider how friendly, liberating, or empowering \nonline relating might be we need to not only account of the types of cues present, but \nwe also need to be mindful that the dynamics can alter depending on when certain \ncues are presented as well as how individuals intend to progress the relationship. \n \n2.3 Presenting the \u2018true\u2019 self \nAnother very appealing aspect of online relating is that some online environments \npresent individuals with unique opportunities to reveal private details that they \nwould typically feel uncomfortable revealing in everyday face-to-face interactions \n(e.g., McKenna & Bargh, 1998, 2000; McKenna et al., 2002). Drawing from \npersonality theorists, such as Rogers (1951) work on the \u2018true\u2019 self, McKenna et \nal. (2002) reasoned that the internet provides a safer space to disclose \u2018core\u2019 \naspects about one\u2019s self. Results from their online survey research found that \nindividuals who are more likely to express their true self online consider these \nrelationships to be more identity-important. Hence, while the internet is not \nnecessarily empowering for all individuals, McKenna et al. (2002) found that \nforming relationships in newsgroup was a positive experience especially for \nsocially anxious and lonely individuals who find it difficult expressing themselves \nin face-to-face situations. \n \n2.4. Playing in cyberspace \nWhitty (2003a; Whitty & Carr, 2006) has also developed a theory which \n 8 \ncontends that relating in cyberspace can be a liberating experience for many \nindividuals. She argues that people often feel freer online compared to face-to-\nface, to flirt, express themselves and engage in sexual activities. Whitty suggests \nthat cyberspace can also feel like a more fun, creative and therapeutic space \ncompared to the offline world.  \nIn devising her theory on relating in cyberspace, Whitty has drawn from \nobject relations theory. In particular (Whitty, 2003a; Whitty & Carr, 2006) has \nfocused on Winnicott\u2019s (1971\/1997) contributions to a psychoanalytic perspective \nof play and considered how these notions might relate to online interactions. It is \nimportant to note that although play might seem more relevant to speak about in \nregards to children\u2019s interactions, Winnicott (1971\/1997) stated that \u2018\u2018Whatever I \nsay about children playing really applies to adults as well\u201d (p. 40). Whitty (2003a) \nconcurs and has written in detail about how individuals might \u2018play\u2019 at love on the \ninternet.  \nTwo aspects ofWinnicott\u2019s (1971\/1997) work have been taken up by \nWhitty in her theorizing about online relationships; these are the notions of \n\u2018potential space\u2019 and \u2018transitional objects\u2019. Although Winnicott originally used \nthese terms to explain the infant\/mother relationship later on he recognised they \ncould be applied to other types of relationships. \nAs Whitty reports in previous work (see Whitty, 2003a; Whitty & Carr, \n2006), Winnicott (1971\/1997) understood \u2018potential spaces\u2019 to be spaces where \nconnections are maintained between an external world and an internal conception \nof self; the space between the subject and object. According to Winnicott, \npotential space is the place where play takes place and creativity becomes \n 9 \npossible. As Winnicott (1971\/1997) once wrote, potential space \u2018\u2018is outside the \nindividual, but it is not the external world. . . Into this play area the child gathers \nobjects or phenomena from external reality and uses these in the services of. . . \ninner or personal reality\u201d. (p. 51) \nAs also outlined in Whitty\u2019s (2003a) paper, Winnicott also employed the \nterm \u2018transitional objects\u2019 in his theorising about play. He observed that infants \noften become fond of a special object, such as a teddy bear, a doll or a blanket, as \nif addicted to this object. The infant develops an attachment to this object, and \nmight suck the object, or suck their thumb or fingers while holding the object. This \nobject Winnicott named the \u2018transitional object\u2019, or the \u2018not-me\u2019 object. What he \nmeans by the \u2018transitional object\u2019 in the case of the child sucking a blanket or \nsome other object is that it is an object that is not the breast but that treating it as \nsuch allows the infant to make a distinction between the \u2018me\u2019 and the \u2018not-me\u2019. In \nrespect to play, Winnicott (1971\/1997) asserted that \u2018\u2018when we witness an infant\u2019s \nemployment of a transitional object, the first not-me possession, we are witnessing \nboth the child\u2019s first use of a symbol and the first experience of play\u201d. (p. 96) \nIn line with Winnicott\u2019s theoretical conception of play, Whitty (2003a) has \nargued that cyberspace can be understood as potential space \u2013 a space which is not \nquite real and not complete fantasy. A space which consists of transitional objects \n(e.g., the computers, monitors, keyboards and so forth). Whitty (2003a) has stated \nthat: \nCyberspace is perhaps a space somewhere outside the individual, but is still \nnot the external world. The participants, the computers, monitors, \nkeyboards, mice, software, modems, text, cables, telephone lines, and so \n 10 \nforth all occupy this potential space; this space between the \u2018real \nindividuals\u2019 and the \u2018fantasy individuals\u2019. Indeed the web might be \nconceptualized as a potential playground. (p. 349) \n \nAccording to Whitty, cyberspace presents more opportunities than the \noffline world to be playful. Individuals can experiment with presentations of self. \nFor instance, some might choose to recreate a more attractive body to represent \nthemselves in various spaces online. Moreover, people can theoretically feel safer \nto flirt and form relation-ships on the internet. This is because the space does not \nseem as real as offline and so rejection can be easier to cope with. This can be a \nvery empowering experience for individuals, especially those who have been \nunsuccessful at developing offline relationships. As Whitty (2003a) states: \nFlirting is a type of play that can occur in this potential space \u2013 cyberspace. \nPlaying at love on the Internet, although synonymous in some ways with \noffline flirting, is characterized here as a unique activity that is a form of \nplay. There is greater opportunity online for fantasy than there is offline. \nOnline participants can inhabit any body they desire, whether that is a \nyouthful body, an attractive body or even a body of the opposite sex. . . \nMoreover, the participant can invent what their fantasy partner looks like, \nfeels like, and feels about them. Participants can fantasize that they are \nattracted to others, and, in turn, others are attracted to them. (p. 349) \nTurkle (1995) has made a similar assessment to what has been described \nabove. In her view about MUDs players, Turkle suggested that \u2018\u2018the computer can \nbe similarly experienced as an object on the border between self and not-self. . . \n 11 \nPeople are able to see themselves in the computer. The machine can seem a \nsecond self\u201d (p. 30). Indeed, we invest emotion toward these objects and, as \nsuggested, these objects can leave a trace within us and serve as psychic keys to \nunlock emotions. In the case of cyberspace this can happen even before we turn on \nthe computer or log onto the internet. \nLike the other theories described above, Whitty (2003a) has emphasised \nthe positive aspects of cyber-relating. However, in agreement with previous \ntheorists she has recognized the dark sides of forming relationships on the Net (see \nWhitty, 2007a; Whitty & Carr, 2005). Akin to Walther et al. (2001), she believes \nthat idealisation can occur in cyberspace. Whitty contends that it is \npsychologically unhealthy for people to stray too far into the fantasy side of the \nonline world \u2013 this could lead to relationships that might never live up to \nexpectations if taken into the offline world or alternatively it might lead to \ncyberinfidelities. \n3. Empirical support for debilitating online relationships \nAlthough this paper is arguing that there are more positive than negative \noutcomes in respect to online relating, it is nonetheless important to present a \nbalanced perspective. This paper will now move to consider how online relating \nmight on occasion be debilitating, before providing the counterview of how it \nmight be positive and liberating. \n \n3.1. Can the internet cause someone to become lonely? \nThe first study to raise the alarm about online relationships was conducted \nby Kraut and his colleagues (1998). In their HomeNet Study, Kraut et al. provided \n 12 \nhouseholds who had never accessed the internet, a computer, a free telephone line, \nand free access to the internet. During the course of the study they tracked changes \nin psychological states. They found that greater use of the internet was associated \nwith negative effects on an individual, such as decreases in the size of one\u2019s social \ncircle, and increases in depression and loneliness. They argued that this was \nbecause internet usage was taking up time that could be better used for more \npsychologically beneficial interactions offline; that is, that online friendships were \nweaker and less healthy than offline friendships. As this paper will examine in \ndetail later, these results were later challenged not other by other theorists, but also \nby Kraut and his colleagues. \n3.2. Excessive use of the internet \nThe problems that individuals encounter with relating on the internet might \nbe explained more accurately by considering how people use this space to develop \nrelationships and how much time they spend on it relating to people. While \nresearchers have found that exploring sexuality online can be a positive experience \n(as detailed later in this paper) it has been found that it is not healthy for those who \nuse the internet excessively to seek out sexual interactions (e.g., Cooper, \nDelmonico, & Burg, 2000; Daneback, Ross, & Ma\u02dansson, 2006; Griffiths, 1999, \n2000; Young, 1998, 1999). \nGriffiths (1999, 2000) and Young (1998, 2000) have written extensively on \nthe topic of internet addiction, claiming that some people can be addicted to online \nsex and forming relationships on the Net. Researchers have found support for their \nclaims. In a revealing study, Schneider (2000) found that cybersex addiction was a \nmajor contributing factor to separation and divorce. Moreover, this study found \n 13 \nthat about half (52%) of cybersex users had lost interest in relational sex. \nImportantly, however, Griffiths has pointed out that many excessive users are not \nnecessarily \u2018Internet addicts\u2019 as such. He states that, in many instances, a \ngambling addict, sex addict and so forth, are simply using the internet as a place to \nengage in their addictive behaviours. Hence, we cannot blame all people\u2019s \naddictions on the internet. \n \n3.3. Internet infidelity \nAnother problematic online sexual activity is internet infidelity (see \nWhitty, 2003b, 2005; Whitty & Carr, 2005, 2006). As Whitty (2003b, 2005) has \nargued, internet infidelity can be both emotional and sexual forms of betrayal. \nInternet infidelity is often construed as upsetting as offline infidelity (Whitty, \n2003b). In one of Whitty\u2019s (2005) empirical studies on internet infidelity she \nfound that the emotional betrayal was a greater concern for many individuals. \nWhitty and her colleagues have argued that people construe acts such as cybersex, \nhotchatting, emotional self-disclosure, and falling in love online as relationship \ntransgressions because partners view this as time and desire being taken away \nfrom oneself and given to another love object. Moreover, the very act of keeping \none\u2019s sexual activities a secret can lead to understandings that online activities \nought to be deemed as unfaithful. Of course, one\u2019s internet infidelities might \ninitiate online and progress offline. Moreover, there are webpages that have been \nset up to hook up people looking for an offline affair. \n \n3.4. Cyber-harassment and cyberstalking \n 14 \nThey are numerous recorded cases that describe how individuals have used \nthe internet to stalk others and organisations. This is an obvious example of a very \nnegative form of online relating. Perpetrators of online harassment and stalking \ninclude strangers, people close to one another (or were close to one another) and \nwork colleagues. Whitty (2007a) has argued that the online environment could \nproduce a greater number of stalkers and harasses than offline. One of the reasons \nfor this is that given the absence of social cues on the internet people are given less \nfeedback as to whether their behaviours are deemed appropriate or not and so \npeople act out more than in an offline setting where they witness immediate \nfeedback. Moreover, people can often be more easily located online. Arguably \nthose addicted to online relationships and sex might also be more likely to \ncyberstalk (Whitty & Joinson, in press). \n \n3.5. Online dating: getting it wrong \nAs argued earlier in this paper, some of the negative encounters individuals \nexperience on the internet might simply be explained by how they are using it to \nrelate and present themselves. Whitty\u2019s (2007b, in press) work on online dating \nclearly illustrates this point. She found that those individuals who created profiles \nwho exaggerated their looks, their status, or how much money they earned were \nfar less likely to be successful at online dating. Moreover, those who wrote clich\u00e9d \nprofiles were more likely to be over-looked by others on the site. In addition, \nindividuals (especially men) who played the numbers game (i.e., sending out many \nemails to potential dates hoping one will respond) were viewed by others as not \nplaying the online dating game by the rules. \n 15 \n \n4. Empirical support for positive experiences of online relationships \nWhile it is important to acknowledge what can go wrong when it comes to \nonline relationships, this paper argues that much more goes right. In line with \nprevious work (see Whitty & Carr, 2006) it is argued here that cyberspace presents \na unique opportunity for people to relate online \u2013 an experience that is sometimes \ndifficult or impossible to achieve in any other medium. \n \n4.1. Real relationships on the Net \nThere is ample evidence to support the view that people do make friends and \ninitiate romantic relationships in cyberspace and often these relationships progress \noffline. For example, in the mid-90s Parks and Floyd (1996) found that two thirds \n(60.7%) of their newsgroup sample had formed a personal relationship with \nsomeone they had met for the first time online. Of these, 7.9% stated that this was \na romantic relationship. Utz (2000) found that 76.7% of the MUD users she \nsurveyed reported forming a relationship online that developed offline, of which, \n24.5% stated this was a romantic relationship. Whitty and Gavin (2001) found that \nindividuals form real friendships in chat rooms and that some of these participants \npreferred that these relationships remain online. These days of course online \ndating sites and social networking sites continue to increase in popularity as a way \nto form new friendships, and seek out new romantic relationships and sexual \nencounters. In more recent research, Wolak, Mitchell, and Finkelhor (2003) \nfound that 14% of youth reported close online friendships and 2% claimed to have \nestablished online romances. So we are left with little doubt that relationships do \n 16 \ninitiate online and progress successfully offline. Importantly, as highlighted above, \nthese relationships are formed in numerous places online. The question that still \nremains is how psychologically healthy are these relationships? Are they worth \nour time or should we instead be spending more time in face-to-face encounters? \nThis paper now attempts to address these questions. \n \n4.2. Does the internet really cause people to become lonely? \nEarlier in this paper, the classic HomeNet study was highlighted, which \ninitially made the claim that online ties are \u2018weak\u2019 ties and are psychologically \nunhealthy because if people spend too much time online they start to feel more \nlonely. Kraut et al.\u2019s (1998) Home- Net Study has, however, been widely \ncriticised. One of the major criticisms made was that they only used 3-items from \nthe UCLA to measure loneliness and their Cronbach\u2019s alpha of .54 was clearly \npoor (Grohol, 1998). Morahan-Martin (1999) argues that the sample size was too \nsmall and not randomly selected. Whitty and McLaughlin (2007) suggest that the \nresults can be explained by considering how internet savvy the newbies in the \nHome- Net Study were. They believe that the participants were more likely in the \ninitial stages to be ineffective users of the technology and the stress in trying to \nwork out how to use this new technology might have caused them to become more \npsychologically distressed. \nIn the 3-year follow-up to the HomeNet study it was found that almost all \nof the previously reported negative effects had dissipated (Kraut et al., 2002). \nInstead, higher levels of internet use were positively correlated with measures of \nsocial involvement and psychological well-being. Whitty and McLaughlin (2007) \n 17 \nargue that this is probably because the participants improved their internet skills \nand confidence over time and so in turn were able to develop more healthy online \nrelationships. \nSome researchers have argued that the internet is custom made for the \nlonely (Morahan- Martin, 1999). Rather than it causing loneliness some have \nsuggested that the internet provides psychologically beneficial relationships that \nthese individuals would have been deprived of had there not been an internet. \nEmpirical research (detailed below) since the HomeNet studies seems to confirm \nthe view that the internet can be an empowering space for lonely people. \nMoreover, we should be mindful that loneliness is not defined in terms of an \nindividual\u2019s social network or number of friends, but rather as a subjective \nexperience. \n \n4.3. Empowering space for the lonely? \nWhitty and McLaughlin (2007) found a relationship between lonely \nindividuals and use of the internet for entertainment. Their study revealed that \nlonely individuals were more likely to use the internet compared to less lonely \nindividuals for social activities, such as playing games and participating in chat \nrooms. Moreover, they found that the more lonely individuals in their sample were \nmore likely to use the internet to obtain information about the entertainment \nworld. These researchers argue that the lonely participants in their sample might \nhave engaged in such activities as an escape from the outside world. Importantly, \nthey acknowledge, however, that they were unable to ascertain whether lonely \nindividuals were more likely to go to the internet for entertainment as a \n 18 \nreplacement for offline activities or if engaging in these activities caused them to \nbecome lonely. As the study also suggests, it might well be that it is those high in \ninternet self-efficacy who benefit from some types of online encounters. \nAmichai-Hamburger and Ben-Artzi (2003) tried to address the question of \nwhether the internet causes loneliness or whether instead the lonely are more \ndrawn to use the internet. More specifically they examined the relationship \nbetween extroversion, neuroticism, loneliness and internet use. A small sample of \n85 Israel university students were given a battery of tests and asked about their \ninternet use of a number of services (e.g., seeking informa- \n tion related to work or studies, joining discussion groups and visiting web-sites). \nAs expected, the study found that extroverts and introverts use different services \non the internet. Amichai-Hamburger and Ben-Artzi (2003, p. 77) claim that: \nThe unique contribution of this study is that is demonstrates not only that \npersonality characteristics are related to differential Internet use, but also \nshows clearly the relationship between personality characteristics and \nloneliness as one important indicator of well-being. These results lead to a \nrejection of the negative generalization of the Internet made by Kraut et al. \n(1998). \nIn a more telling study conducted by Morahan-Martin and Schumacher \n(2003) 277 undergraduates were surveyed about their patterns of internet use. The \nstudy revealed that lonely individuals used the internet and email more than non-\nlonely individuals to make new friends and to interact with others with similar \ninterests. In line with the \u2018disinhibition effect\u2019 (summarised earlier in this paper), \nlonely participants were more likely to prefer online communication than face-to-\n 19 \nface communication and they felt more able to open up about themselves online. \nThe more lonely individuals were also more likely to use the internet to modulate \ntheir negative moods. However, it is important to note that these same individuals \nreported that their internet usage interfered with their non-internet social activity \noften causing them to feel guilty. Morahan-Martin and Schumacher (2003, p. 669) \nargue that: \nTaken together, this suggests a vicious circle whereby lonely individuals go \nonline to fill social voids and emptiness in their life, but their online time \ncreates voids their non-Internet social life and creates other real life \nproblems. Thus, neither of the hypotheses about the direction of \nrelationship between loneliness and Internet use is sufficient. Instead, the \nrelationship may be bi-directional. \nIt is also noteworthy that the link between online relating and loneliness is \nnot restricted to Western samples. More recent research examining a Japanese \nsample found support for the view that online friendships can be psychologically \nhealthy (Ando & Sakamoto, in press). Ando and Sakamoto (in press) in their study \non 187 undergraduate students based in Tokyo and Kyoto found that the \nparticipants who rated themselves low in physical attractiveness benefited from \nhaving a large number of cyber-friends. These individuals were more likely to feel \nless lonely and socially anxious as a consequence of gaining these online \nfriendships. This would confirm the current more popular view that \u2018weak ties\u2019 are \npsychologically beneficial. \n \n \n 20 \n4.4. A safe haven for the shy \n Researchers have argued that not only is cyberspace a potentially \npsychological beneficial space for lonely people, but equally it might be of benefit for \nthe shy, socially inept, and socially anxious (Whitty and Carr, 2006a). For instance, it \nhas been argued that cyberspace provides shy individuals a safe haven to cyberflirt \n(Whitty, 2003a, 2004; Whitty & Carr, 2006a). Joinson\u2019s (2004) empirical work, in \npart, supports this theory. He found that individuals with low self-esteem showed a \ngreater preference for email over face-to-face communication compared to individuals \nwith high self esteem. Although he was not specifically studying shyness, Joinson \ncomments that this finding \u201cexperimentally replicates the observation that shy people \ntend to benefit from computer-based dating systems, and anecdotal evidence that \nsocially anxious people may be more likely to be \u2018pathological\u2019 Internet users than the \nmore socially confident\u201d (pp. 483-484). \n Shy individuals do tend to flock to online dating sites to seek out romantic \nrelationships. In a study by Scharlott and Christ (1995) it was found that \u201cshier users \nwere more likely to agree that Matchmaker allows them to explore new aspects of \ntheir personality\u201d and that \u201cseventy-four percent of the high-shyness users indicated \nthat their main purpose in using Matchmaker was to find a romantic or sexual \nrelationship, while only 46% of the low-shyness users answered that way\u201d (Scharlott \n& Christ, 1995, p. 199). Given that the structure of online dating sites have changed \nsince Scharlott and Christ collected their data Whitty and Buchanan (in press) decided \nto investigate the personality characteristics of online daters. These researchers found \nthat although online dating sites these days require a more in-depth level of self-\ndisclosure and an insistence on providing visual information about oneself (in the \nform of photographs and video) that shy individuals are still very much drawn to \n 21 \nonline dating. These theorists argue that shy individuals still gravitate to online dating \nbecause it provides the social distance and a less real environment making it safer for \nindividuals to initiate romantic relationships. \n4.5. Adolescents and the internet \nBoth scholars and the media have been interested in the types of \nrelationships adolescents form on the internet. Adolescent friendships are critical \nto examine given that friendships and intimacy increase in importance during late \nchildhood and early adolescence (Buhrmester & Furnman, 1987). Moreover, it has \nbeen found that close peer relationships correlate positively to adolescent self-\nesteem and psychological well-being. In contrast, problems with peer relationships \ncan lead to depression and a negative self-image (Hartup, 1996). \nWolak et al. (2003) were interested in whether most adolescents form close \nfriendships and romances online. In addition, they were interested in how often \nyoung people encounter unwanted communication and sexual solicitations online. \nThey found that those adolescents with problems were more likely to develop \nclose online relationships with other youth. This was especially the case for those \nwho felt alienated from their parents. \nIn more recent research, Chou and Peng (2007) found from surveying 494 \nTaiwan adolescent high school students that most of their participants had \u2018net-\nfriends\u2019. Moreover, these adolescents felt they could be fairly open and honest \nwith these friends. In the main they had positive attitudes in respect to the \nformation of online relationships. The types of perceived benefits of having a net-\nfriend included, a greater chance of self-exposure and self-promotion, escape from \nlife\u2019s pressures (e.g., homework, parental, school), more opportunities to \nexperiment with their \u2018ideal self\u2019 and having fun. Interestingly, male students were \nmore positive about their net-friends than female students. \n \n4.6. Exploring sexuality online \nEarlier in this paper the problems associated with being addicted to online sexual \nactivities was discussed. However, engaging in online sexual acts is not a negative \nexperience for all people and instead can be very liberating. Types of online sexual \nactivities includes, downloading pornography, hot chatting, cybersex and \nincorporating the use of teledildonics. Hot chat is \u2018\u2018when two or more individuals \nengage in discourses which move beyond light-hearted flirting\u201d (Whitty & Carr, \n2006, p. 21). In contrast, cybersex is \u2018\u2018generally understood to be synchronous \ncommunication in cyberspace where two or more individuals engage in discourses \nabout sexual fantasies\u201d (Whitty & Carr, 2006, p. 21). Cybersex is not limited to \ntextual exchanges but can also include video and the use of teledildonics. \nBulletin board systems (BBs) were a fairly popular space in the early days \nof the internet and many of these bulletin board systems were sexual in nature. \nSome BBs were especially designed for people to meet others who share their \nsexual interests and to live out their sexual desires online and\/or offline. Wysocki \n(1998) interviewed participants using a BBs called \u2018The Pleasure Pit\u2019 and \nidentified five main reasons for using sexually explicitly BBS, including \nanonymity, time constraints in one\u2019s personal life, the ability to share sexual \n 22 \nfantasies with other people, the desire to participate in online sexual activity, and \nto find people with similar sexual interests to meet face-to-face. Overall, the \nresults from her study suggest that engaging in online sexual activities can be \nliberating and empowering for many people, especially those with unusual fetishes \nwho find it difficult to locate others offline with similar sexual interests. \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the internet is still a popular place for individuals \nwith specialist fetishes. In more recent work, Wysocki and Thalken (2007) \nexamined profiles constructed for an S&M web site. Of the profiles randomly \nselected for the analysis, 37.5% identified as bisexual while 10% stated they were \njust curious. Many of the male photographs showed pictures of their erect penises \nand they were often stroking themselves. Women, in contrast, were mostly not in \nrevealing shots and when they were they were either revealing their breasts or \nshowing photographs bent over showing their buttocks. The profiles these two \nresearchers examined demonstrated that individuals could be very explicit about \nwhat type of sex they were seeking. Like other places online, there was much \nevidence to suggest that individuals felt very uninhibited and free to express their \nsexuality \u2013 providing further support for the view that one can feel empowered \nand liberated in cyberspace. \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe internet is constantly evolving which makes it a challenge for scholars \nto truly know the exact benefits and costs of relating on the internet. This paper \npresented theories which argue that the lack of social cues online leads to more \nimpersonal communication. This arguably is less psychologically beneficial. In \ncontrast, other theories were highlighted which also agree that there are costs to \nonline relating, but that the many benefits should not be ignored. Moreover, that \nthe internet provides unique opportunities compared to everyday face-to-face \nsettings to relate to others. Sometimes relating online can be more personal and \nintimate (hyperpersonal) than relating face-to-face. Individuals can also learn new \nsocial skills online and potentially use these new found skills in their offline \nencounters. The evidence that relating online can have a negative impact on \npeople\u2019s lives cannot be ignored. Spending time online might lead to greater \nloneliness, or increase people\u2019s chances of being stalked or even addicted to the \ninternet. Nonetheless, it has been argued here that the benefits outweigh the costs. \nThere is much evidence to support the view that people enjoy forming friendships, \nfinding love and experiencing sexual encounters in cyberspace. Researchers need \nto spend more time learning about these positive experiences and how the internet \nmight be best used to enhance people\u2019s well-being. \n 23 \nReferences \nAmichai-Hamburger, Y., and Ben-Artzi, E.
