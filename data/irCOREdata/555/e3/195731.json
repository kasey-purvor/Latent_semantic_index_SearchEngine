Introduction\n[2] Since the concept was first proposed by Akasofu\n[1964], the substorm has proven to be one of the greatest\nchallenges in solar-terrestrial physics. Despite advances in\nthe field, the timing, location and possible triggering mech-\nanism of substorm onset remains unclear, with competing\nmodels seeking to explain the instability underlying the\nexplosive reconfiguration during the substorm expansion\nphase [e.g., Lui, 2003].\n[3] The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN:\nChisham et al. [2007]) is an international array of 18 high-\nfrequency (HF) coherent-scatter ionospheric radars with\nfields-of-view covering a significant fraction of the auroral\nand polar ionosphere in both the northern and southern\nhemispheres. Data from a subset of the network can be\nanalyzed to provide detailed localized measurements of\nionospheric plasma dynamics while measurements from\nall radars may be combined using the \u2018\u2018potential mapping\u2019\u2019\ntechnique of Ruohoniemi and Baker [1998] in order to\nestimate the global ionospheric convection pattern in both\nhemispheres. Consequently, SuperDARN has become one\nof the pre-eminent ground-based tools for the investigation\nof the space and ionospheric plasma environment and a vital\ntool when undertaking combined space- and ground-based\ninvestigations [e.g., Amm et al., 2005].\n[4] The SuperDARN system has provided significant\ninroads to the substorm problem by revealing ionospheric\nflows in the nightside ionosphere during both the growth\nand expansion phase, the response of the ionospheric\nconvection pattern to the increased tail reconnection rate\nduring the expansion phase and the family of substorm-\nassociated convection transients observable in the nightside\nionosphere (the reader is directed to Chisham et al. [2007,\nsection 5], for a comprehensive review). However, an\nequatorward migration of radar backscatter has previously\nbeen reported during the substorm growth phase [Lewis et\nal., 1997] while a loss of backscatter (upon which all\nSuperDARN data products depend) is sometimes reported\nin the nightside ionosphere during substorm onset, an effect\nattributed to absorption of HF radio waves by the enhanced\nelectron densities in the substorm precipitation region\n[Milan et al., 1999] and rapid changes in HF propagation\nconditions [Gauld et al., 2002].\n[5] Apart from case-studies of individual substorms, the\nonly previous study to examine the impact of magneto-\nspheric substorms upon SuperDARN radar backscatter was\nthat of Provan et al. [2004]. In that study, SuperDARN data\nwas used to examine the northern hemisphere ionospheric\nconvection pattern during 67 substorms identified by the far\nultra violet (FUV) auroral imager on board the IMAGE\nsatellite. Provan and coworkers reported little change in the\noccurrence of radar backscatter during the substorm growth\nphase with the highest number of radar echoes observed in\nthe post-noon sector dayside ionosphere. Following sub-\nstorm onset, this post-noon sector backscatter grew stronger\nwhile nightside scatter diminished and showed some evi-\ndence of equatorward migration.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A04308, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012910, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lancaster,\nUK.\n2Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012910$09.00\nA04308 1 of 6\n[6] Given the increasing use of SuperDARN measure-\nments for both global and localized investigations of iono-\nspheric flow during substorms and the upcoming focus of\ninternational research effort on the substorm process promp-\nted by NASA\u2019s Time History of Events and Macroscale\nInteractions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission, a com-\nprehensive investigation into the influence of magnetospheric\nsubstorms upon the level of ionospheric backscatter recorded\nby the SuperDARN network is desirable. Such a study is\npresented below.\n2. Methodology\n[7] In order to examine SuperDARN backscatter statistics\nduring substorms, it is first necessary to identify a set of\ncandidate events. Frey et al. [2004] analyzed auroral obser-\nvations made by the IMAGE FUV instrument between May\n2000 and December 2002, identifying 2437 individual\nsubstorms. This list of events, subsequently extended to\nDecember 2005 and including 4193 substorms, forms the\nbasis of the present study. Of these events, we have\nexcluded those substorms that are known to have occurred\nwithin \u00b12 h of another substorm. While we cannot exclude\nsubstorms that occurred within 2 h of an earlier\/later event\nnot observed by IMAGE FUV (e.g., due to unfavorable\norbital position), this measure will reduce the impact of\nmultiple substorm onsets\/intensifications upon our analysis.\nConsequently, the list of substorms to be examined is reduced\nto 3005 individual events fromMay 2000 to December 2005.\nIntervals of data spanning the period \u00b190 min from each of\nthe expansion phase onsets listed by Frey et al. [2004] have\nbeen assessed.\n[8] The field-of-view (f-o-v) of each SuperDARN radar\ncomprises 16 beams separated by \u00013.24\u0001 in azimuth and\nwith each beam subdivided in 75 range gates. During\nstandard operation, each range gate is 45 km in length with\nthe first range gate beginning 180 km from the radar site.\nTypically, the dwell time for each beam is either 3 or 7 s,\ngiving a full 16-beam scan, covering 52\u0001 in azimuth and\nover 3000 km in range (an area of over 3 \u0002 106 km2) every\n60 or 120 s. However, each radar can operate in non-\nstandard sounding modes with the number of beams, length\nof range gate, distance to first range, scan pattern, dwell\ntime and operating frequency being fully adjustable. As\nsuch, data from individual SuperDARN radars have been\nmapped into the spatial grid utilized by the map potential\nanalysis technique of Ruohoniemi and Baker [1998]. This\nglobal grid system has grid cells which span 1\u0001 in magnetic\nlatitude (\u0001111 km projected onto the Earth\u2019s surface), and\n\u0001111 km in the longitudinal dimension. This gridding\nsystem approximately equalizes cell areas, whereas the\nmore conventional choice of a grid defined by fixed steps\nin latitude and longitude suffers from severe variations in\ncell area at differing latitudes. This technique is also the\nsame at that used previously by Provan et al. [2004].\n[9] In the present study, backscatter data from all avail-\nable radars are gridded (without spatial or temporal averag-\ning) at 2 min cadence. Only echoes determined to originate\nfrom ionospheric sources are included, with ground-scatter\nechoes being rejected at this stage. The number of gridded\ndata points is then assessed for the 2 min interval in\nquestion. The quantity of observed backscatter in the grid\nis then weighted to take into account the number of radars\noperating at that time in order to produce a backscatter\nparameter Y, given by:\nY t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc nscatter t\u00f0 \u00de\nnradar t\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Y(t) is the backscatter parameter, nscatter(t) the\nnumber of backscatter measurements and nradar the number\nof operating radars, all measured at time t. By weighting Y\nin this way, variations in the number of operating radars\nover the 2000\u20132005 epoch under investigation will be\nminimized.\n[10] We note that by gridding data according to a geo-\nmagnetic coordinate system, variations in the location of\nsubstorm expansion phase onset (as described by Frey et al.\n[2004]) imply that the results will provide a insight into the\nbackscatter response relative to the statistically averaged\nsubstorm onset location. Nevertheless, this will allow the\nresults to be compared with other statistically well-defined\nfeatures such as the auroral oval and the ionospheric\nprojection of the magnetospheric cusp.\n3. Results\n[11] Figure 1 presents the variation in Y summed over the\n3005 substorms described above as a function of time\nrelative to substorm expansion phase onset. In this case, Y\nhas first been computed for all northern hemisphere radars,\nand then for all southern hemisphere radars (solid traces\nFigure 1. Variations in the backscatter parameter Y\npresented as a function of time relative to substorm onset.\nThe solid traces labeled \u2018\u2018NH\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018SH\u2019\u2019 show backscatter\nvariations in the northern and southern hemispheres,\nrespectively, according to the left-hand vertical axis. The\ndashed traces indicate backscatter variations in the nightside\nionosphere (Ynight) in both hemispheres between 21\u2013\n03 MLT. Latitudinal ranges covering 60\u0001\u201370\u0001, 70\u0001\u201380\u0001\n(dot-dashed), 80\u0001\u201390\u0001 and 60\u0001\u201390\u0001 are indicated and\ncorrespond to the right-hand vertical axis.\nA04308 WILD AND GROCOTT: THE INFLUENCE OF SUBSTORMS ON SUPERDARN\n2 of 6\nA04308\nlabeled \u2018\u2018NH\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018SH\u2019\u2019 respectively) with the denomina-\ntor in equation (1) being replaced by the number of\nnorthern\/southern hemisphere radars available as appropri-\nate. Clearly, the backscatter recorded by both northern and\nsouthern hemisphere SuperDARN radars during the 90 min\nprior to substorm onset gradually builds, peaking 5\u201310 min\nprior to substorm onset before falling to the pre-substorm\nlevel by 90 min after onset. In the northern hemisphere, the\nlevel of backscatter observed at t + 90 min is slightly lower\nthan that at t \u0006 90 min, but shows evidence of recovery\ntoward the pre-substorm level.\n[12] The weighting of the Y parameter takes into account\nthe fact that fewer SuperDARN radars were operating in the\nsouthern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere\nduring the 2000\u20132005 interval under investigation. It is\ntherefore interesting to note that the northern hemisphere\nbackscatter parameter is typically twice that in the southern\nhemisphere. Although the SuperDARN radars used are\nvirtually identical and all located within a few degrees of\n60\u0001 magnetic latitude, it is possible that this systematic\ndifference in the amount of backscatter is an instrumental\neffect. Interhemispheric differences in the HF radio propa-\ngation conditions within radar fields-of-view may also be\nresponsible. For example, northern hemisphere radars\nobserve a considerable number of echoes from so-called\n\u2018\u2018one-and-a-half-hop\u2019\u2019 scatter; ionospheric radar backscat-\ntered that is reflected by the ground\/sea before propagating\nthrough an ionospheric path to the receiver. The increased\nabundance of one-and-a-half-hop scatter in the northern\nhemisphere (where the radars typically overlook ground or\nsea) compared to the southern hemisphere (where the radars\nmainly overlook the generally icy Antarctic continent) may\nexplain this interhemispheric difference.\n[13] The traces labeled \u2018\u2018NH\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018SH\u2019\u2019 include data at\nall latitudes and local times. As such, they show the\n\u2018\u2018global\u2019\u2019 variation in backscatter. However, it is reasonable\nto expect the largest impact of substorms on radar back-\nscatter will occur in the nightside ionosphere. Thus the\nbroken lines in Figure 1 present the variations of Y when\nonly scatter observed between 21\u201303 MLT (northern and\nsouthern hemispheres combined) is included in the numer-\nator of equation (1). Here, Y is further broken down to\nindicate the variation in backscatter in the 60\u0001\u201370\u0001, 70\u0001\u2013\n80\u0001, 80\u0001\u201390\u0001 and 60\u0001\u201390\u0001 magnetic latitude ranges. In the\n60\u0001\u201370\u0001 range, the variation in backscatter resembles the\nglobal trend, rising from t = \u000690 min to peak within a few\nminutes of substorm onset (in this case just after onset) and\nthen gradually falling to pre-substorm levels. The 70\u0001\u201380\u0001\nrange is hardest hit, with the level of backscatter dropping\nby \u000130% within a few minutes of onset. Very little\nbackscatter is observed within the polar cap (mlat \u0007 80\u0001),\nbut the level is approximately constant throughout the\nsubstorm period.\n[14] Figure 2 shows changes in the spatial distribution of\nY in the crucial period from 18 min prior to the substorm\nexpansion phase (t\u0006 18min) to 18min after onset (t+ 18min).\nThe distribution of Y in both the northern and southern\nhemispheres from t \u0006 18 to t + 18 to min is presented in the\nmagnetic latitude\/magnetic local time coordinate system\nshown in the key. In order to improve the statistical\nsignificance of the data, the grid size in both the meridional\nand zonal directions has been doubled (i.e., 2\u0001 in magnetic\nlatitude and \u0001220 km in the longitudinal dimension). The\nchange in backscatter (DY) in both hemispheres is pre-\nsented in the same coordinate system at 6 min time steps. In\neach case, DY is computed relative to the backscatter\ndistribution at the time of the previous plot (and only where\nY is greater than 10). The values of Y and DY are color-\ncoded according to the appropriate color bar.\n[15] At t \u0006 18 min, the distribution of backscatter roughly\ncorresponds to the expected location of the auroral oval,\nspanning all local times and found at higher magnetic\nlatitudes in the dayside ionosphere than in the nightside.\nIn the northern hemisphere dayside ionosphere, most scatter\nis observed in the \u000175\u0001\u201380\u0001 magnetic latitude region,\ndistributed somewhat asymmetrically about noon. Backscat-\nter maximizes in the morning (06\u201312 MLT) sector with a\nminimum around dusk, somewhat in contrast to the post-\nnoon maximum reported by Provan et al. [2004]. Although\nfewer southern hemisphere data are available (as discussed\nabove), there is evidence that the dayside maximum occurs\nin the afternoon sector with a minimum in the morning\nsector. In the nightside ionosphere (both hemispheres),\nbackscatter is greatest in the \u000166\u0001\u201376\u0001 magnetic latitude\nzone and relatively evenly distributed about midnight.\n[16] Between t \u0006 18 min and t \u0006 0 min, the amount of\ndayside scatter increased slightly, indicated by the orange\/\nred DY color coding in the dayside ionosphere as shown in\nFigure 2, while the amount of nightside scatter remained\nbroadly steady, consistent with the trends presented in\nFigure 1. Indeed, the data presented in Figure 1 indicate\nthat the overall scatter in each hemisphere is tending to a\nmaximum as the time of substorm onset approaches, sug-\ngesting that the regions where backscatter is increasing\nmore than compensate for those where backscatter is\nreducing.\n[17] At the time of substorm onset (t \u0006 0 min), there is a\nmarked reduction in nightside backscatter (indicated by the\npurple\/blue color-coding) in the auroral zone in both hemi-\nspheres. In the northern hemisphere, the backscatter reduc-\ntion is greatest in the \u000170\u0001\u201380\u0001 magnetic latitude region\nbetween \u000119\u201303 MLT, while in the southern hemisphere\nthere is some evidence that the effect extends from \u000121\u2013\n05 MLT (albeit based upon fewer data points). Meanwhile,\nin the northern hemisphere, where there are more backscat-\nter data at lower latitudes, the level of backscatter in the\nregion equatorward of \u000165\u0001 increases significantly at sub-\nstorm onset, suggesting that the scatter has shifted in\nlocation. This displacement of backscatter to lower latitudes\noccurs across most local times from dusk to dawn.\n[18] The reduction in nightside backscatter in the\u000170\u0001\u201380\u0001\nmagnetic latitude region continues over the next 18 min\n(lower 3 rows presented in Figure 2). At t + 6 min, the\nregion in which northern hemisphere scatter is falling most\nrapidly appears to move from the pre- to post-midnight\nsector. A similar motion is observed in the southern hemi-\nsphere at t + 12 min. Also, the lower latitude region of\nincreased scatter extends to virtually all local times in the\nnorthern hemisphere at t + 6 min. We note that throughout\nthe interval presented, backscatter in the polar cap is broadly\nunchanged (as indicated in Figure 1).\n[19] Figure 3 shows relative backscatter parameter varia-\ntions in the nightside ionosphere (21\u201303 MLT, between\n(a) 60\u0001\u201370\u0001 and (b) 70\u0001\u201380\u0001 magnetic latitude) sorted by\nA04308 WILD AND GROCOTT: THE INFLUENCE OF SUBSTORMS ON SUPERDARN\n3 of 6\nA04308\nradar operating frequency (Yfreq). This is computed by\nsubstituting nradar(t) in equation (1) by the number of radars\noperating at a given frequency, nradar(t, n). Thus the Yfreq\nbackscatter parameter is weighted according to the number\nof radars operating at the selected frequency. The baseline\nvalue is simply the mean value of the Yfreq computed in\neach frequency band during the t \u0006 90 to t \u0006 60 min\ninterval and reflects the average pre-onset level of the\nbackscatter parameter. SYfreq is the sum of Yfreq in each\nfrequency band computed over the entire epoch and is\ntherefore related to the total number of backscatter measure-\nments made in that band.\n[20] In the 60\u0001\u201370\u0001 magnetic latitude region (Figure 3a),\nthe variations in backscatter parameter follow the broad\ntrend presented in Figure 1 (i.e., increasing prior to sub-\nstorm onset and falling afterward). However, there are\nFigure 2. The spatial variation in backscatter parameter (Y) around substorm expansion phase onset.\nA04308 WILD AND GROCOTT: THE INFLUENCE OF SUBSTORMS ON SUPERDARN\n4 of 6\nA04308\nsubtle differences in the backscatter variations at each\noperating frequency. If we consider that of the 4193 sub-\nstorms in the Frey et al. [2004] list, 85% occurred in the\n60\u0001\u201370\u0001 region, then these differences may have important\nconsequences for the operation of the SuperDARN radars\nwhen studying substorms. SuperDARN radars most com-\nmonly observed echoes in the 8\u201314 MHz range (as indi-\ncated by the large baseline values and SYfreq in these\nfrequency bands). Clearly, this is due to these being the\npreferred operating frequencies (since backscatter cannot be\nobserved in a frequency band that the radar is not sounding).\nOperations in the 14\u201318 MHz range are less common, with\noperation in the 18\u201320 MHz range being somewhat unusual\n(with consequently poor backscatter statistics). However,\nwe note that in the 12\u201314 MHz range, despite reasonable\noverall performance, the backscatter parameter drops below\nthe pre-growth phase baseline level \u000130 min after substorm\nonset. In contrast, in the 8\u201310 MHz range, backscatter\ncontinues to increase for \u000110 min following substorm onset\nand does not fall to the baseline level until t + 90 min.\n[21] In the 70\u0001\u201380\u0001 magnetic latitude range (Figure 3b),\nthe backscatter parameter profile is very different. Radar\nmeasurements in the 8\u201314 MHz range account for the\nmajority of the backscatter indicated in the 70\u0001\u201380\u0001 night-\nside profile presented in Figure 1. However, in the 8\u2013\n10 MHz range, we note that the backscatter minimizes at the\ntime of substorm onset, having begun to fall from the\nbaseline level at t \u0006 30 min. In the 10\u201314 MHz range,\nbackscatter is roughly constant until the time of substorm\nonset (slightly before substorm onset in the case of 10\u2013\n12 MHz) but then falls steadily over the first \u000130 min of the\nexpansion phase. At higher frequencies, the backscatter\ntrend is quite different. For example, in the 16\u201318 MHz\nband, although there is significantly less scatter overall (in\npart because these frequencies are utilized less often), there\nis a notable increase in the level of backscatter during the\n\u000130 min prior to onset. Indeed, in the frequency bands\nabove 14 MHz, there is only a modest fractional reduction\nin backscatter in the crucial \u00015 min after onset (albeit\nimposed on a lower level of pre-onset scatter compared to\nlower operating frequencies).\n4. Conclusions\n[22] We have performed an analysis of SuperDARN radar\nbackscatter during 3005 substorms identified from IMAGE\nFUV observations in the period May 2000 to December\n2005. We find that the global level of backscattered signal\nrises during the 90 min preceding substorm onset by \u000120%,\npeaking a few minutes prior to the expansion phase and then\ngradually declining to approximately the pre-substorm level\nover the following 90 min. In the nightside ionosphere, the\nlevel of backscatter begins to fall a few minutes prior to\nsubstorm onset, with an overall reduction of \u000125% in the\nhour following onset. This modest \u2018\u2018loss\u2019\u2019 of backscatter is\nconcentrated in the region poleward of \u000170\u0001 magnetic\nlatitude, with significant levels of backscatter actually\nshifting to lower magnetic latitudes. Although radar oper-\nations in the 8\u201314 MHz frequency range in the nightside\nionosphere generally result in a significant fraction of\nbackscatter data, there is evidence that operations at fre-\nquencies outside this range might prove advantageous. For\nexample, the 8\u201310 MHz band, which yields excellent radar\nbackscatter in the 60\u0001\u201370\u0001 magnetic latitude region of the\nnightside ionosphere does not perform as well in the 70\u0001\u2013\n80\u0001 region within \u00b130 min of substorm onset.\n[23] The upgrade of a subset of the SuperDARN radars to\nprovide a \u2018\u2018stereo\u2019\u2019 capability has enabled simultaneous\nFigure 3.

The mission comprises five identically instrumented\nprobes with orbits arranged such that during key observing\nseasons, the spacecraft align radially every four days in\norder to measure the timing and evolution of the signatures\nof substorm onset. Crucial to achieving this aim is a\ncomplementary network of ground-based experiments, in-\ncluding a dedicated array of all-sky imagers and fluxgate\nmagnetometers [Donovan et al., 2006]. Given the upcoming\nfocus upon the substorm problem as a result of the THEMIS\nmission and the huge potential contribution to be made by\nthe SuperDARN radar network, the possible benefits of\ndual-frequency operations to SuperDARN radar perfor-\nmance during the substorm expansion phase may prove to\nbe crucial.\n[25] Acknowledgments.
