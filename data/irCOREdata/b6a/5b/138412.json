Market\nturbulence has tended to increase for a number of reasons. Demand in\nalmost every industrial sector seems to be more volatile than was the case in\nthe past. Product and technology life-cycles have shortened significantly and\ncompetitive product introductions make life-cycle demand difficult to predict.\nAt the same time the vulnerability of supply chains to disturbance or\ndisruption has increased. It is not only the effect of external events such as\nwars, strikes or terrorist attacks, but also the impact of changes in business\nstrategy. Many companies have experienced a change in their supply chain\nrisk profile as a result of changes in their business models, for example the\nadoption of \u2018lean\u2019 practices, the move to outsourcing and a general tendency\nto reduce the size of the supplier base.\nThis paper suggests that one key element in any strategy designed to\nmitigate supply chain risk is improved \u2018end-to-end\u2019 visibility. It is argued\nthat supply chain \u2018confidence\u2019 will increase in proportion to the quality of\nsupply chain information.\nManaging supply chains in today\u2019s competitive world is increasingly\nchallenging. The greater the uncertainties in supply and demand,\nglobalisation of the market, shorter and shorter product and technology life\ncycles, and the increased use of manufacturing, distribution and logistics\npartners resulting in complex international supply network relationships,\nhave led to higher exposure to risks in the supply chain (Christopher et.al.,\n2002).\nSupply chain risks come in many different forms (Harland & Brenchley,\n2001). First, the financial risks can be huge. Inventory costs due to\nobsolescence, markdowns and stock-outs, can be significant. Personal\ncomputers devalue by more than one percent per week. In the USA retail\nmarkdowns constitute about 20% of total retail volumes. Mismanaged\nsupply chains, leading to excessive or mismatched inventory, are thus liable\nto huge financial risks. Financial risks can also present themselves through\nthe risk of reworking stock and penalties for non-delivery of goods.\nThe complexity and uncertainty within a supply chain can also increase the\n\u201cchaos\u201d risks within the supply chain. These chaos effects result from over- Deleted: ri\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n4\nreactions, unnecessary interventions, second guessing, mistrust, and\ndistorted information throughout a supply chain (Childerhouse, et.al, 2003).\nThe well-known \u201cbullwhip\u201d effect (Lee, et.al., 1997), which describes\nincreasing fluctuations of order patterns from downstream to upstream\nsupply chains, is an example of such chaos. Deming called this\n\u201cnervousness.\u201d This increased nervousness will of course lead to higher\ncosts and inefficiencies through over-ordering and \u2018squirreling\u2019 of inventory.\nIn addition, there are many unexpected and unpredictable disruptions that\nadd to the risks of a supply chain. The closure of the US air space after the\nterrorist event of September 11, 2001; the longshoremen strike in California\nin 2002, and the outbreak of SARS in 2003, are examples of events that\nparalysed supply chain flows. The impacts of such disruptions can be\ncatastrophic.\nThe existence of nervousness and chaos in a supply chain also means that it\nis difficult to make optimal decisions at each stage in the supply chain. The\nrisks of making the wrong or ineffective decisions, or decision risks, become\nthe inevitable consequence. Thus, for example, it will not be possible to\ndesign optimal production schedules if there is uncertainty as to when\nmaterials or components will be available.\nUltimately, the supply chain is exposed to market risks, i.e., missing the\nmarket opportunities that may exist. A supply chain cannot be responsive to\nchanging market trends and customer preferences if the right market signals\ncannot be recognised. For example, a supply chain cannot support a new\nproduct launch if it is unable to change production or supplies to meet\ndemand. Finally, market opportunities can be missed when customer orders\nwith short lead times cannot be met.\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n5\nA supply chain with high risk exposure cannot be efficient. A manager\nrunning a supply chain with these risks lacks confidence in the supply chain.\nTable I shows some of the many ways in which supply chain confidence can\nbe impacted.\nTable 1 : Lack of Supply Chain Confidence\nNo confidence in:\n\uf0b7 Order cycle time\n\uf0b7 Order current status\n\uf0b7 Demand forecasts given\n\uf0b7 Suppliers\u2019 capability to deliver\n\uf0b7 Manufacturing capacity\n\uf0b7 Quality of the products\n\uf0b7 Transportation reliability\n\uf0b7 Services delivered\nThe Risk Spiral\nWhere do these supply chain risks come from? There are evidently tangible\nrisks in the supply chain which lead to its poor performance (Wilding, 1998),\nfor example, high levels of process variation, but what are not recognised in\nthe same way are the intangible elements, for example, the attitudes and\nperceptions of the users and members of the supply chain. The intangible\nlack of confidence in a supply chain leads to actions and interventions by\nsupply chain managers throughout the supply chain, which collectively, could\nincrease the risk exposure. A classic example of this is the potential reaction\nfrom the customer-facing end of a business. For example, if a sales team\nbelieves that order cycle and order fulfilment times are not reliable, they\nwill devise their own means of addressing this. They may order stock so as\nto have supplies to support their key customers and put in phantom (i.e.\ntheir own private buffer stock) orders to secure supply, all causing\ninefficiencies. Figure 1 depicts the risk spiral as a self-perpetuating descent\ninto chaos. Because there is no visibility of upstream and downstream flows\nand stocks, confidence declines and decisions are taken to buffer the\ninterfaces in the supply chain with inventory to cope with uncertainty. These\ninventory buffers then serve to further obscure supply chain visibility because\nthe end-to-end pipeline is now longer as a result of the build up of inventory.\nThese effects are reinforced by the actions taken by workers to ignore the\nformal system and create an operative informal system\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n6\nFigure 1 : The risk spiral\nWithout supply chain confidence, entities within the supply chain are liable to\nchaos and decision risks and the acceleration and expansion of the above\nspiral. Sales people start over-ordering since they do not have timely\nvisibility of the correct demand signals, or they know from experience that\nsupplies may be late or insufficient to fill the complete orders. Production\nplans are based on inflated production lead times due to similar lack of\nvisibility and control. \u201cSafety lead times\u201d are commonly used in standard\nMRPs, since production planners do not want to be blamed for production\ndelays. The lack of means to expedite or flexibility in manufacturing also\nmeans that any yield shortfalls or production downtimes have to be made up\nby additional production, and as a result, lead times are stretched out in\nproduction plans.\nThis risk spiral exists everywhere, and the only way to break the spiral is to\nfind ways to increase confidence in the supply chain. To do so, we need to\nunderstand the elements of the supply chain that can reduce the lack of\nconfidence \u2013 visibility and control.\nVisibility\nConfidence in a supply chain is weakened when end-to-end pipeline\ntime, i.e., the time it takes for material to flow from one end of supply\nchain to the other, is long. The increased globalisation of supply\nchains and the prevalent use of subcontract manufacturing and\noffshore sourcing can contribute to the length of time it takes to\ncomplete all the needed steps in the process. Associated with pipeline\nlength is the lack of visibility within the pipeline. Hence, it is often the\ncase that one member of a supply chain has no detailed knowledge of\nwhat goes on in other parts of the chain \u2013 e.g. finished goods\ninventory, material inventory, work-in-process, pipeline inventory,\nLack of\nconfidence\nLong\nPipelines\nBuild-up\nof buffers\nLack of\nvisibility\nDeleted: \u00b6\n\u00b6\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n7\nactual demands and forecasts, production plans, capacity, yields, and\norder status.\nThe key to improved supply chain visibility is shared information\namong supply chain members. Traditionally companies have tended\nto subscribe to the view that \u2018information is power\u2019 and to interpret the\nphrase as meaning power is diminished if that information is shared.\nIn fact in supply chains the reverse is true. If information between\nsupply chain members is shared, its power increases significantly.\nThis is because shared information reduces uncertainty and thus\nreduces the need for safety stock. As a result, the system becomes\nmore responsive and, ultimately, could become demand driven rather\nthan forecast driven. Mason-Jones and Towill (1997 and 1998) have\ndemonstrated that \u2018information-enriched\u2019 supply chains perform\nsignificantly better than those that do not have access to information\nbeyond their corporate boundaries.\nControl\nIn addition to visibility, supply chain confidence requires the ability to\ntake control of supply chain operations. Paradoxically, most supply\nchains do not have a great deal of control once the order is released.\nHence, even if a supply chain manager has visibility of some part of\nthe pipeline, he\/she often could not make changes in a short time. For\nexample, even if information is obtained on demand changes or on\nyield shortfalls, the supply chain manager may be helpless, since the\nsuppliers may not be flexible enough to respond to late changes, or\nthere are no expediting options available, or the production line is\ninflexible and production schedule changes are not feasible, etc.\nSemiconductor manufacturers are often faced with this problem of lack\nof control. In this industry, the long lead times required by foundries\nare such that, even if the manufacturer is made aware of sudden\nmarket demand changes, it takes a long time to respond so that the\nmarket opportunities are then missed.\nRecently there has been much interest in the \u2018Six Sigma\u2019 methodology\nas a way of reducing variability in processes (for example, George\n2002). Six sigma tools such as control charts and Failure Modes and\nEffects Analysis (FMEA) can be very helpful in identifying the\nopportunities for reducing process variability in supply chains.\nHowever, these tools and methodologies are primarily of benefit within\nthe business for the control of repetitive activities. In looking to\nimprove control across the wider supply chain a more collaborative\napproach to control is required. The newly emerging field of Supply\nChain Event Management (Stiles, 2002) holds some promise here.\nThe idea behind Event Management is that partners in a supply chain\ncollaborate to identify the critical nodes and links through which\nmaterial flows across the network. At these nodes and links, control\nlimits are agreed within which fluctuations in levels of activities are\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n8\nacceptable e.g. shipments from an off-shore manufacturing source. If\nfor whatever reason the level of activity goes outside the control limit,\nthen an alert is automatically generated to enable corrective action to\nbe taken.\nThe impact of loss of confidence\nWithout visibility and control, it is common that the supply chain is plagued\nwith buffer inventories. Buffering is another means employed by supply\nchain managers to hedge against the uncertainties and risks in the supply\nchain. Excessive inventory of course leads to higher financial risks. Another\nmeans by which supply chain managers hedge against supply chain\nuncertainties and risks is through investing in excessive capacity. The well-\nknown episode of 1995-6 in the semiconductor industry is such a lesson.\nThe conditions of 1995 were chaotic, with many IC orders left unfilled, lead\ntimes were excessive, and supplier unreliabilities were at an all-time high.\nWorried that demand would continue to outstrip supply, semiconductor\nmanufacturers were concerned to find ways to assure supply. The problems\nfaced by fab-less semiconductor manufacturers were even more acute.\nWithout clear demand and supply visibility throughout the supply chain, and\nthe feeling of not having control of their own fabrication capabilities resulted\nin many fab-less semiconductor manufacturers finding ways to invest in\ncapacity \u2013 some purchased wafer capacities with foundries, some co-invested\nin new fabrication lines with their foundry partners, and some toyed with\nideas like capacity options in the same way that options work in the financial\nmarket. When the 1996 market did not turn out to be as rosy, many of\nthese manufacturers incurred significant financial losses.\nWithout confidence, logistics providers also have to build slack into their\noperations. Quoted transportation lead times may have built-in safety times,\nand extra shipping capacities may need to be purchased. Lacking visibility of\nshipment and requirement schedules, unnecessary expedite shipments may\nbe taken, or the wrong mode of transportation is used.\nThe lack of confidence also makes it difficult to be responsive to customers,\nto react to changes in market conditions, and to be competitive in providing\ncustomer service. Lead times quoted to customers tend to be longer, since\nadded protection is needed when the sales representative does not have\nconfidence in the supply chain. Similarly, contracts may be constructed in\nways that do not give much flexibility to customers, and special requests by\ncustomers are turned down. The supply chain is no longer competitive. The\nsupply chain is thus liable to market risks. This is exactly the situation that\nAdaptec, a semiconductor manufacturer, was faced with in 1997. The\ninability to quote precise order lead times to their customers, and the failure\nto meet the lead times reliably resulted in loss of market share.\nOf equal concern is the risk to the business of a sudden downturn in demand\nwhilst inventory levels are high through excessive buffering.\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n9\nProbably one of the biggest and most costly examples of what can happen\nwhen supply chains are heavily buffered at the same time that demand\ndeclines, was provided by Cisco in 2001 when they announced an inventory\nwrite-off of US$2 billion as a result of a dramatic fall-off in orders for their\nnetwork infrastructure products. Because demand for those products had\npreviously been rising at a meteoric rate and supply of components was often\nconstrained, all levels in their supply network had been buffering through\nplacing additional orders.\nWith excessive buffer inventory and capacity throughout a supply chain, as\nwell as long pipelines from end to end, the information pertaining to the\nstatus and problems within the supply chain is also less available meaning\nthat prompt actions to respond to irregularities or unexpected events are less\nfeasible. Thus, there is even less confidence in the supply chain operation,\nand the vicious cycle of the risk spiral repeats itself \u2013 lack of supply chain\nconfidence creates excessive supply chain risks, which in turns breeds\nactions by supply chain members that could further erode the confidence of\nthe supply chain. Table II gives some examples of how low confidence\ncreates risk in the supply chain.\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n10\nTable II : Lack of confidence and supply chain risk\nBusiness Area Lack of confidence outcomes\nSales \uf0b7 Over order to hold buffer stocks for key\ncustomers\n\uf0b7 Over quote on delivery times to customers \u2013\nmay lose the order\nCustomer service \uf0b7 Cannot give accurate information on\navailability\n\uf0b7 May order buffer stock to assist customers\nOperations \uf0b7 Can derive no patterns of sales due to lack of\nconfidence in other areas \u2013 forecasting\nbecomes inaccurate and the trend continues\n\uf0b7 Likely to over-produce or have excess capacity\nto compensate for lack of confidence in other\nareas\nMarketing \uf0b7 Delays in new product launches due to\nuncertainty of supply\n\uf0b7 Markdowns or big discounts when left with\nexcess inventory at end of season or at the\nend of product life cycle\nRaw material\nsupplier\n\uf0b7 Does not have accurate forecast and has\nsuffered from previous emergency\nrequirements, starts to hold more stock and\npasses the cost onto their customer\n\uf0b7 Quote long lead times to hedge against risks\nBreaking the Spiral and Restoring Supply Chain Confidence\nSupply chain confidence reflects the perception of performance reliability at\neach step in the chain. In other words how much faith do the various players\nin a supply chain have in the ability of those \u2018upstream\u2019 and \u2018downstream\u2019 of\nthemselves to do what they say they\u2019re going to do.\nThe higher the confidence the greater will be the willingness to reduce safety\nstock for example. Equally once confidence is gained there is likely to be a\ngreater willingness to move further in terms of substituting information for\ninventory.\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n11\nTo restore supply chain confidence and break the risk spiral, we must\naddress the two basic elements of supply chain confidence: visibility and\ncontrol.\nTotal end-to-end visibility will enable supply chains to be transparent, and\nthe right information would be available to the right member of the supply\nchain at the right time. Enabling adequate control levers to be accessible to\nthe partners will also allow prompt actions to be taken when information\nreveals such needs. Both visibility and control are critical for restoring supply\nchain confidence, although in some cases, one may take priority over the\nother. For example, in Figure 2 below, we show how visibility and control are\nneeded in situations with differing lead times and on time performance.\nFigure 2 : Relative importance of visibility & control\nO\nn-\nT\nim\ne\nPe\nrf\nor\nm\nan\nce\n(L\nea\nd\nT\nim\ne\nR\nel\nia\nbi\nlit\ny)\nS h o r t\nT ig h t c o n t r o ls ,\nc o r r e c ti v e a c tio n s\nta k e n p r o m p t ly\nId e a l S i tu a tio n\nL o n g\nB o th v is ib i l i ty a n d\nc o n tr o ls a r e n e e d e d\nH ig h v is ib i l i ty f o r\ne f f e c tiv e p la n n in g\nL o w\nH ig h\nL e a d T im e\nHere are a few key levers to break the risk spiral:\nInformation Accuracy, Visibility and Accessibility\nThroughout the supply chain, key operational metrics and status\nreports such as inventory, demand, forecasts, production and\nshipment plans, work in progress, yields, capacities, backlogs, etc.,\nshould be accessible easily by key members of the supply chain. Such\ninformation should be accurate and timely, rendering it useful for all\nparties for planning and re-planning purposes. Thus, it is important\nthat the key indicators are tightly managed and that any updates are\nmade as timely as possible. The accuracy of the data should be a\nsource of confidence to the parties using the data.\nAlerts for Out of Control Conditions\nAny time when deviations from the plan have occurred, then the\nappropriate parties in the supply chain have to be alerted. Here,\nintelligent controls are needed to determine if the deviations are\nnormal, random events, or if they represented some systematic or\nunexpected changes that warrant attention. The parallel to statistical\nprocess control can be drawn here. A process control chart should be\nsensitive enough to detect out of control conditions, but not overly\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n12\nsensitive so as to cause the system to be overly nervous, with a lot of\nunnecessary changes and corrections.\nResponsive Corrective Actions\nWe should provide members of the supply chain with contingency\nplans and the tools to make corrective actions when out of control\nconditions have been detected. For example, if the shipment\nschedules have deviated from plan due to traffic conditions, then there\nshould be clearly defined contingency plans for the logistics carrier to\ntake appropriate actions, e.g., expedite shipments may be used,\nalternative supply source may be tapped, or product offerings to the\ncustomers may have to be changed.\nSupply chain leaders like Benetton have invested in gaining the confidence of\nthe supply chain through visibility and controls. Benetton\u2019s extensive EDI\nnetwork linking its design centre with the network of outsourced\nmanufacturers, sales agents, retail outlets, transportation carriers and\nlogistics centres allow the supply chain to become transparent. Its\ninvestments in flexible manufacturing lines with its famous postponement\nconcepts in manufacturing, cycle time reduction, and its state-of-the art\ndistribution centre also enable it to respond to demand signals promptly, by\nbeing able to change production schedules and distribute the right products\nto the right markets to meet the highly seasonal demands of apparel\nproducts. The company has also invested in computer-aided design tools\nwhich are linked to computer-aided manufacturing tools, concurrent design\nprocesses, and cross-functional design teams so as to reduce the new\nproduct development cycle. This enables the company to introduce new\nproducts in the middle of a season in response to the fashion trends of the\nseason.\nAs indicated earlier, the lack of supply chain confidence and the exposure to\nexcessive market risks had hurt the market share of Adaptec, a\nsemiconductor manufacturer. It was not until 1997 when the company\ninvested in internet technologies to gain visibility of its supply chain\noperations throughout the complete supply chain, consisting of Adaptec in\nMilpitas, California, TSMC in Taiwan, ASAT in Hong Kong, and Seiko in Japan,\nthat the company began to regain some of the confidence in its supply chain\nperformance. Working with logistics providers and design teams at the\nmultiple companies that span the Adaptec supply chain, Adaptec was able to\nput in place control levers to respond to out of control conditions promptly,\nthose improving its supply chain drastically. The result was that the total\ncycle time was reduced by 50%, inventory dropped by 30%, customer\nsatisfaction significantly improved, and ultimately, improving ROA and\nprofitability.\nSynchronising the supply chain\nOnce information can flow across the supply chain, then we are only a short\nstep away from a dramatic reduction in total system inventory whilst\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n13\nsimultaneously improving responsiveness to demand. The ability to match\nsupply more closely with demand we call agility and the key to agility is\nspeed (Christopher & Towill, 2002). If flows through the pipeline can be\naccelerated then it stands to reason that volatile unpredictable demand can\nbe met more precisely. Even better, there is less inventory in the pipeline\nbecause it is shorter \u2013 in effect we have substituted information for\ninventory.\nHowever, agility is not a single company concept. Rather it implies\nsynchronisation from one end of the pipeline to the other. In other words all\nthe players in the supply chain are marching in step, to the same drum beat\nas it were.\nSynchronous supply requires transparency of demand and pipeline inventory\nin as close to real time as possible. It also requires a willingness on the part\nof all the members of the supply chain to work to a single supply chain plan.\nEven a short while ago such an idea would have seemed fanciful. However,\ntwo things have changed the landscape of supply chain management in the\nlast few years. The first of these is the availability of the technology and the\nsoftware to enable the capture and sharing of information across a supply\nchain \u2013 increasingly using extranets. The second, even more fundamental\nchange, is the increasing willingness of members of the supply chain to put\naside the traditional arms-length relationship with each other and in its place\nmove towards a closer, partnership-type arrangements.\nEvidence of these information-based collaborative supply chains is emerging\nin industries as diverse as automobiles, grocery retailing and apparel\nmanufacturing. One leading UK retailer Sainsbury has developed an extranet\nto enable suppliers such as Nestle to access point of sale data. Nestle are\nnow better positioned to re-supply Sainsbury and in turn can share that data\nwith their materials and packaging suppliers. The effect is staggering, the\nwhole supply chain is now demand-driven rather than forecast driven.\nIn high fashion, traditionally, companies in the apparel industry have had\npipelines up to twelve months long with all the risk that that implied. The\nSpanish company Zara can move from design to in-store availability in a\nmatter of weeks as a result of closely connected, highly synchronised\narrangements with internal and out-sourced suppliers. For companies like\nZara, these supply chains are increasingly global and yet, through\ntransparency of information, they can still maintain a high degree of agility\nand confidence.\nConclusion\nWhile supply chain risks tend to paralyse most supply chains, the case is not\nhopeless. Successful companies are the ones that break the risk spiral by\nrestoring supply chain confidence throughout the chain. The benefits are\nmuch more than cost reduction, but also, as we argued earlier, the reduction\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n14\nof market risks leads to increase in sales and market share, penetration to\nnew markets, and speedy new product introduction.\nClearly not all supply chain risk is created through a lack of confidence\namongst supply chain members. However, our contention is that\nimprovements in confidence, as we have defined it, can have a significant\neffect on mitigating supply chain risk.\nInternational Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management, 2004\n15\nReferences\nChilderhouse, P., et.al.
