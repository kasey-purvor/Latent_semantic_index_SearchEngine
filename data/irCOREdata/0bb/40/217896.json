To this end, the paper examines a\nscheme drawn up in the 1920s which saw the introduction of a muchmore liberal\nregime for convicts in Port Blair. Under these plans, convicts were granted access\nto land and encouraged to bring their families from the mainland. This research\nreveals that the policies which determined the history of the settlement in this\nperiod were defined by two tensions. First, there was a constant battle between\nthe central authorities and provincial governments over the shape and purposes\nof the settlement. Second, there was a contradiction between the penal objectives\nof the colony and the larger strategies which aimed to develop the islands for the\ngreater British empire.\nIntroduction\nThe reputation of the settlement at Port Blair as one of the most\nbrutalising of colonial institutions is well deserved. The penal colony\nin the Andaman Islands, with its intemperate climate, inhospitable\nenvironment and often gruelling quotidian regime meant that to\ncross the kala pani (lit. black water) to serve a sentence in Port Blair\nwas, at times, one of the harshest forms of punishment in colonial\nIndia.1 In the historiography, however, often effect has been mistaken\n1 The term \u2018kala pani\u2019 was used to describe the loss of caste status which an\nIndian supposedly underwent when he or she crossed the seas. To the British, the\nterm represented the separation from community which was supposed to have made\ntransportation particularly dreadful to Indians.\n367\n368 TAYLOR C . SHERMAN\nfor intent. Nationalist histories of this \u2018terrible torture camp\u2019 tend\nto assume that in the colonial prison imperialists found a unique\nopportunity to fulfil their racist objectives and experiment with new\n\u2018beastly practices\u2019.2 Recent scholarship, though more balanced, has\ncontinued to focus on the sinister schemes of imperial administrators.\nIn his study of convict life in the settlement in the nineteenth\ncentury, Satadru Sen has argued that because the colonial power\nhad little hope of turning its subjects into disciplined, self-policing\ncitizens, its aim was to manoeuvre Indians into positions where they\ncould be more easily policed, or where they could be co-opted as\ncollaborators who would in turn police others.3 His work, however,\npresupposes both an ability to coordinate policy formulation and an\naptitude for execution that the colonial state in India simply did not\npossess. Sen also undervalues the differences between penitentiaries\nand penal colonies by arguing that the two systems were both\nbased on Utilitarian principles. As a result, he has overlooked the\nplace of transportation in the larger imperial project, and he has\nneglected to consider the special contradictions which arose when\ndiscipline and imperial development were combined.4 Finally, though\nhe draws parallels between penal regimes in Europe and punishment\nin India, his analysis ends precisely when the extremely harsh prison\nroutines which were in vogue in the mid-nineteenth century fell out\nof fashion. In almost every country, including India, the twentieth\ncentury witnessed the emergence of penal regimes which tended\nto eschew imprisonment by moving young offenders into borstals,\n2 Himanshu Joshi, Yatana-Shivir Mein (Andaman ki Ankahi Kahani) [In the Torture Camp\n(The Untold Story of the Andamans)] (Delhi: Rajpal and Sons, 1998), p. 1.

Though\nthis punishment was retained, the experience of transportation was\nnonetheless moderated considerably in the twentieth century.\nThis paper follows the story of the Andaman penal settlement into\nthe twentieth century. It analyses plans drawn up in the 1920s to\ndevelop the penal settlement at Port Blair as a free community.\nThe seemingly inherent flaws of the penal colony prompted the\nGovernment of India to try to end the practice of transportation,\nand to develop the islands using free settlers. Provincial governments,\nhowever, intervened to frustrate the plan to end transportation\naltogether. This forced the Government of India to relax the penal\nregimen in order to develop the land and the economy of the islands\nusing convicts rather than free men and women. As part of the\nscheme, \u2018volunteers\u2019 from Indian jails came to the Andamans, and\nwere encouraged to bring their families with them. In the middle of\nthe 1920s, Mappilas from the Malabar rebellion also took part in this\nnew project. However, their transportation sparked uproar back on\nthe mainland which induced the government of Madras to cancel the\nplan and to offer to repatriate these families.\nBy following the history of these schemes, the present paper\nchallenges the existing scholarly consensus on the settlement at Port\nBlair. It argues that the policies which determined the shape of\nthe Andaman penal colony were not unified or coordinated. Instead,\nthey were defined by two tensions. The first was a tension between\nthe conflicting demands of imperial development and punishment.\nThough established in the aftermath of the mutiny\/rebellion of 1857,\nthe penal settlement at Port Blair was also designed to make the\nislands suitable for (non-indigenous) human habitation, and to secure\nthe waterways of the Bay of Bengal for British trade and defence.\nWhile it was built according to principles drawn up for the Straights\nSettlement in Bencoolen (Sumatra), it was also heavily integrated into\nthe Indian penal system because limited term prisoners were sent to\nthe island alongside life prisoners. As a result, the colony was subject\nto pressures to conform to ideals of discipline and reform which were\nmore appropriate to penitentiaries onmainland India. For this reason,\n5 William James Forsythe, Penal Discipline, Reformatory Projects and the English Prison\nCommission 1895\u20131939 (Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 1991).\n370 TAYLOR C . SHERMAN\nits administration always had to contend with the conflicting demands\nof imperial development and punishment.6 In the late nineteenth\ncentury, the camp\u2019s regime tended to favour discipline, but by the early\ntwentieth century, developmental imperatives had come to the fore.\nThe second tension was between centre and periphery.7 The colony\nmay have been administered by the central Government of India,\nbut it was populated by prisoners sent from the provinces. Provincial\ngovernments often shaped penal policies in ways which had little to\ndo with either larger imperial strategies or disciplinary objectives.\nThis paper examines how these administrative and political factors\ninadvertently combined to foster one of themost liberal penal regimes\nin British India.\nHell in Andamans\nAfter the First World War, India\u2019s colonial government entered\na period of relative political liberalisation. The introduction of a\nnew constitution in December 1919 brought Indians into provincial\nassemblies with significant law-making powers.8 At the same time,\nIndian nationalists, led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, launched India\u2019s first\nmass campaign of civil disobedience, the non-cooperation movement.9\nAs a result of the confluence of these two events, colonial institutions\ncame under fresh scrutiny in the early 1920s. The penal settlement in\nthe Andamans was soon at the centre of these investigations. In this\nspirit, the Government of India appointed Sir Alexander Cardew to\nlead an official committee of enquiry into the state of Indian Jails.10\nShortly after the Cardew committee reported, Colonel Wedgwood, a\npolitician of the British left, and an advocate of Indian independence,\nwrote a piece in London\u2019s Daily Herald on 29 December 1920, entitled\n\u2018Hell in Andamans\u2019, in which he decried the nature of convict life in\n6 Kiran Dhingra,The Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Twentieth Century (NewDelhi:\nOxford University Press, 2005), p. 36.\n7 Frederick Cooper and Ann Laura Stoler (eds.), Tensions of Empire: Colonial Cultures\nin a Bourgeois World (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997).\n8 Thomas R.

His piece was based on the stories of a former political\nprisoner whom he had encountered during a train journey.11 Though\nconveyed in a more melodramatic form, Wedgwood\u2019s article revealed\nlittle about Port Blair which the Indian Jails Committee (IJC) did\nnot also report upon. Both the IJC\u2019s report and Wedgwood\u2019s account\ncriticised aspects of the penal colony which seemed to be inherent to\nit.\nA persistent complaint was that life in the Andamans was unhealthy\nfor those sent there. Being on tropical islands with numerous swamps,\nconvicts in the Andamans were highly prone to malaria and to\nother mosquito-borne diseases, as well as to cholera and tuberculosis.\nMoreover, prisoners from the north of India found that they had no\nreprieve from the islands\u2019 incessant hot weather, as they had had\nduring the winter months back home. So, whether they were confined\nto the Cellular Jail, as they were after their arrival, or labouring\nunder the sun in their later years on the island, working in Port Blair\nwas not only taxing to the convict but could endanger his health as\nwell. The camp therefore gained a reputation for having a high death\nrate.12\nApart from environmental hazards, the organisation of the penal\nsettlement seemed to foster exploitative relationships between\nprisoners. As in prisons on the sub-continent, certain convicts could\nearn the privilege of being warders over their fellow inmates in Port\nBlair. This systemgrew out of financial necessity, butwas also intended\nto serve as an incentive for good conduct: well-behaved prisoners\ncould work their way up to a position of greater responsibility with\nmore privileges.13 However, this arrangement could equally encourage\ngraft and abuse.

Wedgwood recorded that, without many women\nin the colony, Burmans, who formed about one-third of the prisoners,\nwere \u2018used as prostitutes\u2019.15 The IJC was particularly unnerved by\nthe proliferation of \u2018unnatural offences\u2019 on the island. Homosexual\npractice, the IJC argued, was the fault of the administration, which\ncould not keep adequate watch over persons working outside the\nCellular Jail. In order to reduce this practice, established prisoners\nhad long been given the option of bringing their wives to the islands or\nmarrying locally, though only after they had been in residence for at\nleast 10 years.16 Though many did marry locally, and it appears some\nsent for their wives, some colonists refused this option, reportedly\nbecause they feared for the safety of their wives in such a setting.17\nIn addition to these questions of mortality and propriety, financial\nconsiderations served to undermine government support for the\ncolony. Transportation was commonly used throughout the empire\nto reduce the cost of imprisoning people in their home countries.18\nThe average cost per prisoner of running Port Blair, however, was up\nto three times as much as that in mainland jails. The Government of\nIndia therefore concluded that, \u2018. . . the maintenance of the Andamans\nas a penal settlement cannot be justified much longer on financial\ngrounds\u2019.19\n14 The Daily Herald, 29 December 1920, NAI, Home Political (Deposit), f. 65,\nJanuary 1921.\n15 Ibid.\n16 Indeed, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, several attempts were made\nto bring women into the settlement in these ways.

The government declared that,\n\u2018Abandonment could not for a moment be contemplated\u2019,20 for too\nmuchmoney had been invested in the islands\u2019 colonisation, the forests\nwere believed to have commercial potential, and, \u2018from the Imperial\npoint of view it would be madness to abandon them . . . in the hands of\nanother power they might be a source of irritation and even danger\u2019.21\nIf the islands were to be converted into a free settlement by inviting\nordinary emigrants from the mainland, what could be done with the\n11,532 convicts and the 3,000 \u2018local born\u2019 persons, i.e. the children\nof convicts, on the islands? The centre asked the provinces to take\nback their prisoners, starting with the ill, infirm and incorrigible.\nThis was no small task for the provinces. Around 4,000 convicts\nwere repatriated, but the bulk of the healthy ones stayed in Port\nBlair because the provinces were unwilling to make arrangements for\ntheir return. There were three factors which combined to prevent the\nrepatriation of prisoners from Port Blair to the mainland. First, it was\nwidely held that, compared to the conditions in jails on the mainland,\nlife was relatively easy for a man in the Andamans on \u2018ticket leave\u2019,\ni.e. for a convict who, after around 10 years on the island, had earned\nthe privilege of living in \u2018semi-independence\u2019, working for wages or on\na plot of land and having a family. It was agreed that to repatriate\nthese men to serve their sentences in close confinement in Indian\njails would cause the prisoners \u2018serious hardship\u2019.22 Second, under the\nsevere financial constraints of the post-war period, it was difficult to\nfind the funds necessary to build new prisons for the returning men.\nFor example, the United Provinces (UP) Government had around\n2,200 convicts in Port Blair for whom the Government would have to\nfind space back in the UP. In addition to these men, they estimated\nthat they would have to house an additional 250 inmates in each\nfuture year who would be sentenced to transportation, but who would\n20 Home Department Resolution, 27 February 1926, WBSA, Revenue (Jails) 2T-3\nProgs A 10\u201311, May 1926.\n21 C.W.

SHERMAN\nnot be sent to the Cellular Jail.23 They concluded that in order to\naccommodate the increased population, they would require a new jail\nto be constructed at Meerut, at a cost of Rs. 5\u201310 lakh.24 There was\n\u2018no immediate prospect\u2019 of the province finding these funds.25\nLogistical considerations were not the only impediment to\nrepatriation. The Government of India\u2019s plan ran roughshod over the\nnew constitutional arrangement under which \u2018jails\u2019 was a subject for\nthe provinces to manage. By closing the penal colony, the Government\nof India was shifting the expense of maintaining and housing\nthese prisoners back to the provinces. Of course, retrenchment of\ncentral spending through such shifts was a major benefit of the new\nconstitution. Given the large sums which the provinces had to transfer\nto the centre under the new constitutional arrangements, provincial\ngovernments were not happy to take up any new financial burden.26\nFor this reason, the UP\u2019s Finance Department responded insolently\nto the Government of India\u2019s plan.\nBy making rules of this kind, India is imposing on the provinces a large\nadditional expenditure and is setting aside the [UP Legislative] Council\u2019s\ncontrol over the purse. It is impossible to see what constitutional powers they\nimagine themselves to have to pass such rules at all: jails are a provincial\nsubject.27\nThe Finance Secretary felt that the central government was \u2018asking\nfor a rebuff\u2019 from the UP\u2019s Legislative Council, which could deliver\none by not approving the money for new jails in the province.28\nMost provinces felt the same financial constraints as the UP, and\nonly two, Central Provinces & Berar, and Bihar & Orissa, prepared\n23 Lieutenant-Colonel J.M.

Taking this opportunity to defy the centre, the government\nof UP decided to interpret the centre\u2019s orders to suit the province\u2019s\nneeds.\nThe directions of the Government of India that deportation was to be stopped\nwere not absolute, but only indicated the object to be carried out \u2018as far as\npracticable\u2019. How far the object can be attained obviously depends on the\namount of accommodation available and in view of the Inspector-General\u2019s\nreport there seems no alternative but to begin deporting again. It will not be\nnecessary to refer to the Government of India for orders, but they will have\nto be informed what is being done.30\nThe Government of India did not receive this news with equanimity,\nbut they had no power to force the construction of provincial jails.\nThere was deadlock.\nThe Government of India could not send the prisoners back, and\nnor could they find anyone to replace them. Recruiting free persons\nto settle on the islands proved to be a difficult task for, as it\nturned out, \u2018the islands had acquired a sinister reputation as a place\nof banishment\u2019.31 Thus, though the practice of transportation was\nsomewhat anomalous in the 1920s, and there was little ideological\njustification for the retention of the penal colony, the settlement at\nPort Blair remained in use not because of its exemplary disciplinary\nregime, but because no compromise could be found between the centre\nand the provinces which would facilitate the transformation of the\npenal settlement into a free colony.\nUnable to continue as they had set out to, the Government of India\nchanged course. In late 1925, they decided to make the best of \u2018the\nmaterial at hand\u2019 and to use the convicts as the \u2018nucleus\u2019 for a free\ncommunity on the islands. This entailed a radical transformation both\n29 Bengal\u2019s Revenue Department determined, \u2018in the present financial position the\nGovernment are not prepared to begin the construction of any new jails.\u2019 Memo by\nM.C.

SHERMAN\nof the penal colony and of the lives of its convicts. The settlement at\nPort Blair was revolutionised through a number of changes, most of\nwhich aimed to get convicts out of the jail and onto the land. Whereas,\nin the past, a person would have spent at least nine and a half years\nin a labour corps, toiling on public works, before earning \u2018ticket leave\u2019\nto work on the land, the new regulations provided for the grant of\nthis dispensation after only one month on the islands.32 Further,\nthe administration changed the system of land rights. Under the old\nsystem, convicts on ticket leave worked on the land, but their property\nreverted to the state when they were released.33 In recognition of the\nfact that agricultural development had \u2018suffered\u2019 from the \u2018artificial\nnature of the settlement and the lack of any security of tenure of\nland\u2019,34 it was decided that after five years as a paid labourer, a convict\nwould be given a piece of land \u2018to maintain himself and his family\u2019.\nUpon release, he would be entitled to the occupancy rights.35 These\nmeasures fundamentally altered life in the colony. Whereas, before\nthis action, only 10% of inmates had been on ticket leave, by 1926,\n56%had been granted this self-supporter status.36 TheGovernment of\nIndia began to see the new arrangement as an \u2018experiment in penology\nwhich will give selected convicts an opportunity of rehabilitating\nthemselves in new surroundings\u2019.37 The authorities were optimistic.\nThese self-supporters, the Chief Commissioner reported, worked\nharder, claimed less sick-days, and were more productive and better\nbehaved than before.38\nHaving sent 4,000 ill, infirm and incorrigible individuals away,\nhowever, the colony was under-populated, even for this more modest\nscheme. To remedy this, the Government of India initiated a\nrecruitment drive to induce prisoners from India to volunteer to serve\n32 T.

In order to persuade convicts to\ncome, and to rid themselves of those on the island who did not wish to\nparticipate in the new arrangement, liberal remissions were offered.\nThese remissions embroiled the authorities in a predicament which\ndemonstrated the extent to which administrative convenience and the\nimperative of having a uniform policy could eclipse the drive to instil\ndiscipline in prisoners.\nNormally, a prisoner could earn remissions for work and for other\ngood behaviour and thereby reduce his sentence. During British rule,\nthose serving their sentence in Indian jails could earn remissions,\nbut in the Andamans they were not eligible to do so. Under the\noriginal plan to close the penal settlement, convicts who returned to\nthe mainland were offered remissions of one-third of their sentence.\nThis was intended both as an inducement to return and \u2018partly as\ncompensation for the increased rigour of an Indian jail\u2019.39 However,\nthis did not prove to be good penal practice. Ferrar, the Chief\nCommissioner in the Andamans, did not like the idea of offering\nremissions to only a select group of prisoners for fear that it\nwould provoke resentment amongst inmates.40 To treat one class of\nprisoners differently to another without reason was not consistent\nwith the principle that confinement should be an egalitarian form\nof punishment. Further, if the object was to entice men to stay and\nparticipate in the new regime, remissions provided to those who left\nfor the Central Provinces or for Bihar & Orissa would hardly achieve\nthis result. Thus, it followed that \u2018to grant remissions to convicts of\nthese two provinces and to deny them to the convicts of other provinces\nwho have been kept in the islands for administrative reasons would\nbe inequitable\u2019.41 In the end, all prisoners, whether they returned to\nIndia or remained in the Andamans, were granted remission of one-\nthird of their sentence. The Government of Bengal protested that\nthere was \u2018no logical basis\u2019 for this course of action.42 Indeed, such a\n39 T.

SHERMAN\nprogramme provided no incentive for good behaviour, and therefore\nran counter to the principles of the remissions system. Having granted\nremissions to one group, however, the Government found itself in a\nposition where not only were they not encouraging convicts to stay in\nPort Blair, but they were fostering resentment amongst those who did.\nThus, in the words of the Government of Bengal, the sole object of\nthe grant of remissions was to \u2018secure administrative convenience\u2019.43\nThe remissions quagmire and the solution found for it demonstrate\nthe extent to which the tools of modern penology could be used for\npurposes other than discipline. Administrative convenience was often\nthe dominant motive for the policies which governed India\u2019s prisons,\neven in Port Blair.\nWanted: Convicts\nOnce the new course of action had been agreed upon, and it was certain\nthat convicts would form the \u2018nucleus\u2019 of the new life in the Andamans,\nthere remained the problem of recruiting suitable persons to inhabit\nthe colony. Requesting provincial governments to send volunteers, the\nGovernment of India described the kind of man which they wished to\njoin the settlement.\n. . . the object of the Government of India is to attract volunteers from\nprisoners of the casual or accidental type, preferably men who have not\nbeen over three years in jail. Habitual offenders such as thieves or house\nbreakers are not wanted. Adolescent convicts after three or four years of\nBorstal treatment would be particularly welcome as colonists. These classes\nare not intended to be exhaustive but they are sufficient to indicate in a\ngeneral way the type of volunteer who is wanted and the type who is not.44\nThe recruitment drive appears to have been reasonably successful:\nin the first 18 months of the programme 276 men volunteered to go\nto Port Blair.45 One major obstacle to the prosperous development\n43 W.S.

Even though 31 volunteers from amongst the female\nconvict population in India had transferred to Port Blair after the\ncommencement of the volunteer programme, the proportion of women\nto men remained extremely low. When most of the convicts had\nbeen in the labour corps, this had not been a problem, but after the\nmajority had been granted the privilege of working their own piece of\nland, the scarcity was felt more acutely. The Government observed,\n\u2018. . . experience has shown that a single convict cannot satisfactorily\ncultivate a holding by himself\u2019.46 In order to successfully tend a piece\nof land a family was desirable as, it was believed, the division of labour\nwithin a family was tailored to suit land cultivation. Men on ticket\nleave had been encouraged to marry locally or to import their wives,\nbut many were \u2018unable to obtain wives for themselves\u2019.47\nThe family was central to British conceptions of stability and\nprosperity in India. As such, since the inception of the penal colony\nseveral attempts had been made to bring women to Port Blair to\nassist in the reformation of men by curtailing homosexual activity,\nencouraging domesticity and improvingmale economic productivity.48\nIt is no surprise, therefore, that in the 1920s the authorities devised\ntwo schemes to foster the creation of families in the Andamans.\nFirst, they encouraged volunteers from amongst the women in Indian\njails. Ferrar believed that female convicts on the mainland could be\npersuaded to move by the promise of a better life.\nIt is possible that there are many convicts . . . who would be ready to exchange\nthe rigour and monotony of Indian Female Jails for the comparative freedom\nof the Andamans by marrying self-supporters.49\n46 Home Department Resolution, 27 February 1926, WBSA, Revenue (Jails) 2T-3\nProgs A 10\u201311, May 1926.\n47 J.D.V.

SHERMAN\nSuch women had to be of marriageable age and either unmarried or\nwidowed. Upon arrival it was expected that they select a husband and\nsettle down with him.50\nIn her prison diary, Urmila Shastri, a civil disobedience prisoner,\nrecounted the deplorable conditions which women faced in ordinary\njails in India. Though Shastri was in Meerut\u2019s zillah (district) jail, her\ndiary records the stories of women who passed through her barrack.\nFrom these accounts, a picture emerges of an environment where\nwomen were beaten by warders, and abused by their fellow inmates.\nBribery appears to have been widespread. There were indications that\nsex was a major currency in many of these transactions, for one of the\nprisoners told Shastri, \u2018Those girls who were pretty, they lived easily\u2019.\nShastri refused to record the rest of her cell-mate\u2019s story, writing\ninstead, \u2018Oh God! I cannot write of those matters. I cannot say up to\nwhat point her stories were true, but from her images, my heart was\nalarmed\u2019.51\nOrdering in women in the same manner as the authorities had\nrequisitioned other \u2018necessities\u2019, such as tools and land, to raise\nproductivity does seem like a particularly egregious example of\npatriarchal thinking. Yet, the women involved did exercise their own\nagency to some degree. It was almost certainly a choice between two\nevils, but it was the woman\u2019s decision to come to the islands to marry\nunder the new scheme. Given the stigma attached to an ex-prisoner,\nespecially a female one, women convicts may have reckoned that their\nbest chance of escaping the grim conditions in Indian jails and finding\na stable life was in the Andamans. Women who took this gamble\nselected a husband and settled with him on his land.52\nThe second prong of the scheme was to have convicts ask their\nwives and children to join them in the settlement. To this end, the\nBengal Government provided the means for Bengali inmates serving\nsentences of transportation for life to return to the province in order\nto persuade their wives and children to join them in Port Blair.53 It\nis unclear how successful this endeavour was. After years away from\nhome, many of these people may have lost contact with their relatives,\n50 Home Department Resolution, 27 February 1926, WBSA, Revenue (Jails) 2T-3\nProgs A 10\u201311, May 1926.\n51 Urmila Shastri, Karagar [Prison] (2nd edn., Delhi: Atmaram and Sons, 1980), pp.\n34\u201335.

One group which did\nemigrate in large numbers were the Mappilas, from the southern\ndistricts of inner Malabar in Madras, in present-day Kerala.\nThe Mappila Rebellion and the Mappila Colony\nin the Andamans\nMappilas (or Moplahs), as the Muslims of Malabar were known,\ntended to be peasant cultivators. Since the early nineteenth century,\nthey periodically had risen against their landlords and the landlords\u2019\nprotectors, the law enforcement officers of the British Raj. At the root\nof these revolts was disgruntlement with the system of land tenure in\nthe districts. Since the penetration of the British into the area, the\njenmis (landlords) had acquired an increasingly tyrannous position over\nthe verampattomdars (tenant cultivators). Prostrate under the weight of\narbitrary evictions and predatory rent-rises, the peasant cultivators\nperiodically took up arms. Though various pieces of legislation had\nsought both to deter them from resorting to violence, and to improve\ntheir rights vis-a`-vis landlords, their grievances remained after the\nFirst World War.54 In August 1921, at the height of the Khilafat\/non-\ncooperation movement, the Mappilas rose again. Though Khilafat\nand non-cooperation movement leaders distanced themselves from\nthe revolt, many Mappilas invoked the name of the Khilafat during\nthe uprising, and the British did not hesitate to blame the national\nmovement after the outbreak of violence on 1 August 1921.55 After\nsix months of fighting, which included assaults on government and\nlandlord property, guerrilla attacks on government troops and forcible\nconversions to Islam, the rebels had been utterly routed.56 Official\nfigures of Mappila casualties recorded 2,339 killed, 1,652 injured and\n5,995 captured, while another 39,348 voluntarily surrendered.57\n54 ConradWood,TheMoplah Rebellion and its Genesis (NewDelhi: People\u2019s Publishing\nHouse, 1987), K.N.

These rebels were accorded all\nthe benefits of the new, more liberal regime in the Andamans.\nAccording to officials, the Mappilas \u2018made very good settlers\u2019, as they\nproved extremely useful to the Forest Department.58 Thus, when the\nGovernment of Madras proposed that these prisoners be allowed to\nbring their families to the Andamans, the Government of India readily\nagreed to the plan.59 In accordance with the new arrangement, the\nMappilas in Port Blair were given the choice between bringing their\nfamilies to the islands and being repatriated to jails in Madras.\nAccording to the Government of India, the former option proved\ntempting because,\nThe climate of the Andamans is very similar to that of Malabar and the\nconditions under which the Mappilas will hold land in the Island will be very\nmuch better than those . . . in their own Province.60\nWhen the first ship arrived at Port Blair on 12 July 1925, 292\nMappila women and children disembarked to join their relations\non the island.61 Shortly thereafter, the Chief Commissioner began\nmaking preparations for another 150 Mappilas, \u2018with appropriate\nwomen and children\u2019, to settle in the islands. This group had elected\nto exchange the barbed-wire camps which had been their homes for\nthe past 30\u201336 months for the settled life they had been promised\nin the Andamans.62 By late 1926, 1,326 Mappila rebellion prisoners\nand 528members of their families had settled in exclusively Mappila\nvillages in the Andamans. The volunteer programme appears to have\nbeen popular, for in that year, another 534men had volunteered, and\nthe Government had to ease its eligibility criteria in order to allow\nCommander-in-Chief in India, on the Operations in Malabar for the period 20th\nAugust 1921 to 25th February 1922, 6 October 1922, IOR L\/MIL\/17\/12\/33.\n58 Home Department Summary, [undated], NAI, Home (Jails), f. 297, 1925.\n59 \u2018The Government of India consider that the scheme holds promise of success\nand will be of benefit both to the Government of Madras and the Forest Department\nin the Andamans which is faced with the difficulty of obtaining cheap free labour.\u2019\nC.W.

Their\nchildren attended school.65 A number of newspapers, including The\nHindu, visited the new villages and wrote glowing accounts of the life\nof the Mappilas there.66\nWhile the administration in the Andamans praised the adaptability\nand industriousness of the Mappilas, nationalist Muslims in Madras\nmounted a public campaign against their transportation. This took the\nform of public meetings of protest, as well as resolutions condemning\nthe scheme in the Madras Provincial Legislative Council and in the\nCentral Legislative Assembly. The objections raised included the\ncomplaint that minor participants in the unrest were being sent\nto a life of exile which was not warranted by their crime. Further,\nthere was anxiety that the removal of young men and their families\nfrom the community would have negative economic repercussions.67\nAt public meetings fear was expressed for the health of Mappilas\nand their relations who had been sent to islands which \u2018have been\npronounced to be uninhabitable for human beings\u2019. Some members\nof the public were convinced that the government aimed not only to\n\u2018wreck the moral, material and social well-being of the migrants\u2019 but\nalso to depopulate the southern districts of Malabar of the Mappila\npopulation and thereby ruin economically those who remained.68\n63 Whereas the unexpired portion of a prisoner\u2019s sentence formerly had to be at\nleast five years, three yearswasmade theminimum for these prisoners.Colonisation of\nthe Andamans by theMappila convicts \u2013 note in this connection for the information of\ntheHon\u2019ble theHomeMember with theGovernment of India by Lt-Col J.P.

SHERMAN\nIn the Legislative Assembly, Maulvi Sayad Murtuza Sahib Bahadur\ncalled for the Mappilas to be sent home, and for the colony to be\nclosed.69 Prompted by the above accusations, Alexander Muddiman,\nthe Home Member in the Viceroy\u2019s Council, as well as a deputation\nof Mappilas visited the settlements in the winter of 1925. Ferrar,\nthe Chief Commissioner, seems to have convinced Muddiman of the\nmerits of the scheme, but he was not successful with the Mappila\ndelegation.70 The debate continued, and the Government of India\nstepped in to secure a compromise. According to the Government of\nIndia\u2019s order of 4 October 1926, Mappilas in the Andamans were\nonce more given the opportunity to choose to return (this time with\ntheir families) to jails in Madras, while those imprisoned in Madras\ncould volunteer to go to Port Blair. Ferrar reported that another 448\nconvicts in Madras elected to establish themselves in the islands,\nwhile the option to return to the mainland, \u2018was made use of by 80\nsingle men only\u2019.71 Ferrar speculated that, though single men may\ndecide to go back to Madras, \u2018it appears probable that the bulk of the\nmarried will remain in Port Blair where they have ample land with\noccupancy right[s] and [are] in healthy surroundings\u2019.72 This did not\nsatisfy the Madras Legislative Council which nevertheless organised\nthe accelerated release of the Mappila rebellion convict-settlers. It is\nclear that political pragmatism shaped policy towards the Mappilas\nfar more than disciplinary dogmatism.\nIt was politically expedient to export the Mappilas from Madras to\na land where they could cause less trouble to the authorities, even if\nthis meant that they would not be punished for treason in the same\nway as previous rebels. But while discipline may have had a political\nend, the politics played over the settlement in the Andamans did not\nnecessarily have disciplinary aims. The scheme for the transportation\nof the Mappilas was not unambiguously iniquitous, however. On the\none hand, a number of Mappilas were able to become landowners in\nthe Andamans, and to enjoy thereby a more secure existence. And yet,\nthey were not able to achieve this without leaving their homeland.\n69 Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly, Volume VIII, pp. 246\u2013279, 1926, IOR,\nV\/9\/74.\n70 M.L.

The authorities in Bengal argued that\nthis step was necessary because, without transportation, the ordinary\npenalties available were insufficiently severe to combat terrorism. In\nthe absence of this punishment, men awarded a life sentence were\neligible not only for release after 14 years, but also for remissions.74\nThis was not, in the opinion of the Bengal Government, sufficient\npunishment for terrorists. The Government of India agreed, but\ndecided that those sent to Port Blair for offences related to terrorism\nwould not take part in the settlement, but would \u2018serve the entire\nperiod of their sentence in jail\u2019.75 Thus, while ordinary convicts in the\nAndamans enjoyed a life of relative comfort, and political prisoners\nin mainland jails, especially those who were non-violent middle-class\noffenders, were earning numerous concessions and privileges from the\nauthorities, conditions for the few hundred terrorist prisoners housed\n73 On the government response to the new nationalist campaign see, D.A.

SHERMAN\nin the Cellular Jail may have been the harshest in the country.76 This\nis how the Andamans achieved its place in the nationalist imagination.\nBetween 1937 and 1939, as Indians governed in autonomous\nprovincial assemblies, the number of \u2018volunteers\u2019 from Indian jails\nseems to have fallen. The colony did not revert to its previous condition,\nhowever. Endeavouring to recruitmore volunteers, theGovernment of\nIndia published a pamphlet in 1940 which was designed to encourage\nconvicts to leave behind their jails in India and to embark upon a new\nlife in Port Blair. \u2018Free\u2019 was the catchword. They were promised free\nhealth care and free education for themselves and their families, as\nwell as the use of facilities for sport, recreation and worship, \u2018without\nlet or hindrance\u2019.77 Describing the living quarters in which recently\narrived convicts called talabdars were housed, it was written, \u2018These\nbarracks are not surrounded by walls or fences and the talabdar leads\na free life except that he has to do the daily task of Government\nwork assigned to him\u2019.78 The talabdar earned wages for his work, the\npamphlet explained, and \u2018after the day\u2019s work the talabdar is free till\n8 pm\u2019.79 In addition, association with other inhabitants was relatively\nunrestricted, \u2018the talabdar wears his own clothes and buys his own\nfood or forms a \u201cmess\u201d with some of his friends\u2019.80 In conclusion,\nthe pamphlet promised, \u2018The system developed affords an excellent\nopportunity for a man, should he so desire, to make a new start in a\nnew country where prejudices do not exist\u2019.81\nTwenty years earlier, conditions in Port Blair appeared to have been\nbleak. This paper has not been intended to serve as an apology for\nBritish activities in the Andaman Islands. Nor would it seek to obscure\nthe suffering of convicts in the penal settlement. But it has argued\nfor a re-evaluation of the settlement in two respects. First, the grim\nstate of life in the Cellular Jail ought to be compared with the dire\nconditions in many ordinary Indian jails, and with the prison regimes\nin other countries, rather than with the life of a free man. There were\nindications that, even before the initiation of the reforms, the life\n76 On the concessions made to political prisoners in the 1930s, see, Taylor C.\nSherman, \u2018The Politics of Punishment and State Violence\u2019 (PhD thesis, University of\nCambridge, 2006), Chapter 7.\n77 Note on the Andamans for the Information of Volunteer Convicts, 1 August\n1940, NAI, Home (Jails) f. 86, 1938.\n78 Ibid.\n79 Ibid.\n80 Ibid.\n81 Ibid.\nFROM HELL TO PARADISE ? 387\nof convicts was not as unbearable in Port Blair as it was elsewhere.\nFor example, prison officials felt that men being repatriated to the\nmainland ought to be given liberal remissions, in order to compensate\nthem for the hardships which they would have to endure in provincial\nprisons.\nWhether comfortable or dreadful, the system of punishment at Port\nBlair was not always driven by the unrelenting pursuit of \u2018discipline\u2019.\nScholars are bound to find evidence of the desire to discipline subjects\nwhen they only study the rules which dictated the quotidian regime\nto be followed by inmates. However, these accounts of the colonial\npenal system contend that discipline was the primary factor which\nshaped not only prisoners\u2019 daily lives, but the entire penal system\nand the colonial state itself. By shifting one\u2019s gaze to examine the\npolicy-making process, it becomes clear, however, that practices of\npunishment were never independent of administrative, political or\nfinancial constraints. Even in a penal settlement, the colonial state\nhad to square the desire to maintain control with the imperatives of\n\u2018development\u2019. It had to reconcile its imperial ambitions both with\nthe autonomy of the lower levels of government and with the political\ncircumstances of the time.\nReferences\nArchive Collections\nFerrar Papers, Centre of South Asian Studies, University of Cambridge.\nIndia Office Records, British Library, London, Legislative Assembly Proceedings,\nMilitary Department and Parliamentary Office files.\nNational Archives of India, New Delhi, Home (Jails), Home (Political) files.\nUttar Pradesh State Archives, Lucknow, Judicial (Criminal) files.\nWest Bengal State Archives, Calcutta, Revenue (Jails) files.\nSecondary Sources\nAnderson, Clare, Convicts in the Indian Ocean: Transportation from South Asia to Mauritius,\n1815\u20131853 (Houndmills: Macmillan, 2000).\nAppadorai, A., Dyarchy in Practice (London: Longmans, Green & Company, 1937).\nBrown, Judith M., Gandhi\u2019s Rise to Power: Indian Politics 1915\u20131922 (Cambridge,\nEngland, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1972).\nCooper, Frederick and Ann Laura Stoler (eds.), Tensions of Empire: Colonial Cultures in\na Bourgeois World (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997).\nDamousi, Joy, Depraved and Disorderly: Female Convicts, Sexuality and Gender in Colonial\nAustralia (Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1997).\nDhingra, Kiran, The Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Twentieth Century (New Delhi:\nOxford University Press, 2005).\n388 TAYLOR C .
