Amante\nfrom Level3 during the\nfirst Inter-Provider QoS\nWorkshop held at MIT in\nOctober 2004.\n2 Within this article, we\nuse the same terminology\nfor both IMS and\nTISPAN.\nGENERAL CONTEXT\nThe emergence of new services such as video\nstreaming and IP telephony requires IP networks\nto provide stringent guarantees \u2014 not only in\nterms of traditional quality of service (QoS) met-\nrics \u2014 but also in terms of availability (e.g., five\nnines for telephony) and robustness during emer-\ngency situations. From the earliest stage of IP\nnetworking, proposals have aimed to capture and\nsupport the requirements of various services,\nespecially in the realm of forwarding and routing.\nIn 1994, the Nimrod initiative [1] was launched\nwithin the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) with the goal of providing service-specific\nrouting in the presence of multiple constraints\nimposed by operators and end users. RFC1992,\none of the key documents produced by the Nim-\nrod initiative, states that inter-network connectiv-\nity and services should be represented by maps at\nmultiple levels of abstraction. Nevertheless, this\nrecommendation was never implemented. Addi-\ntionally, QoS forwarding mechanisms such as\nIntServ [2] and DiffServ [3] were proposed but\nwere not widely introduced into operational net-\nworks.1 The exceptions are practices adopted by\noperators, such as enforcing shaping and policing\nrules and using marking techniques to distinguish\nflows only at the access segments of their IP net-\nworks. This is due to the complexity and the lack\nof clear views on the manageability of such mech-\nanisms and also to the fact that operators are not\nready to refrain from their practices related to\nover-provisioning in favor of sophisticated traffic\nengineering techniques.\nQOS HURDLES IN 3GPP ARCHITECTURES\nToday, voice over IP (VoIP) is one of the major\nfields of service innovation, and most service\nproviders plan (if they have not yet started) to\nmigrate their public switched telephone network\n(PSTN) infrastructures to IP. For this goal, IP\nmultimedia subsystem (IMS) [4], telecoms, Inter-\nnet converged services, and protocols for\nadvanced network [5] (TISPAN) architectures\nhave been specified by the 3rd Generation Part-\nnership Project (3GPP) community to meet the\nrequirements of service providers.2 As far as\nQoS requirements are concerned, 3GPP docu-\nmentation introduces the notion of QoS class\nbut does not clearly define this notion. TS 23.107\nidentifies four QoS classes: conversational class,\nstreaming class, interactive class, and back-\nground best effort. But TS 22.105 makes use of\nfour groups of applications in terms of QoS\nrequirements and points out that there is no strict\none-to-one mapping between these groups and\nthe classes as defined in TS 23.107. However TS\n22.105 uses exactly the same names for its taxon-\nABSTRACT\nThis article presents a technology-agnostic\nand a multi-dimensional (i.e., routing, forward-\ning, and traffic management dimensions)\napproach for the management of IP network\nresources to ensure service differentiation with\nboth intra- and inter-domain scope. This article\nintroduces the network plane (NP) and parallel\nInternets (PI) concepts for achieving service dif-\nferentiation. Based on these concepts, a func-\ntional architecture together with a business\nmodel is presented. In addition, this article\ndescribes how the proposed approach can\nbecome a promising platform for the IP multi-\nmedia subsystem (IMS), with the objective of\nproviding end-to-end QoS-enabled multimedia\ndelivery across multiple providers to replace the\nflow-based reservation mode known as the VoIP\nresource reservation framework.\nQOS CONTROL IN NEXT-GENERATION\nMULTIMEDIA NETWORKS\nM.

The following key\nissue results: is a QoS class defined in terms of\nQoS parameter values, or is it defined in terms\nof QoS requirements for a group of applica-\ntions?\nIn addition, 3GPP relies on DiffServ to pro-\nvide network services with the requested QoS\nparameters. Unfortunately, the statement Diff-\nServ is used to provide QoS says very little about\nhow the network actually can be engineered to\ndeliver the requested QoS. It is true that it has\nnever been the intent of QoS standards to pro-\nvide information on how the actual network\nengineering is to be done. However, a significant\ngap does exist between the way network objec-\ntives are presented in terms of numerical values\nfor delay, jitter, and loss and the way DiffServ\nper hop behaviors (PHBs) are defined. Creating\nbest current practices (BCP)-type documents\ncould provide valuable information to try to nar-\nrow this gap. The engineering of QoS require-\nments, as well as robustness and availability\nrequirements, do not appear to be addressed by\n3GPP, although the assumption is made that a\nQoS-enabled network is available and that QoS\ncan be requested on a per application-flow basis,\nespecially during the session establishment,\nwhich is expressed as a session description pro-\ntocol (SDP) offer. The success of such a session\nis a necessary condition for the reservation of\nappropriate resources in both directions of the\ncall. An example of implementing this mode is\nthe QoS preconditions as defined in [6]. This\nmode has several drawbacks, such as increasing\nthe connection set up and release times, espe-\ncially when crossing multiple telephony domains.\nMoreover, 3GPP specifications do not detail\nhow to check the validity of the QoS require-\nments enclosed in SDP offers, what the interface\nbetween the VoIP signaling protocols and the\nQoS enforcement mechanisms is, how to vali-\ndate the required QoS in both call directions,\nhow requested QoS will be guaranteed, or how\nto ensure coherency of multimedia treatment\nwhen crossing several autonomous systems and\nIP telephony domains.\nARTICLE STRUCTURE\nTo handle the aforementioned challenges, main-\nly QoS and robustness, the A liGhtweight\napproach for viable end-to-end IP-based QoS\nservices (AGAVE) project introduces the con-\ncepts of network plane (NP) and parallel Inter-\nnets (PI) [7, 8], a novel transport platform that\noffers end-to-end service differentiation across\nthe Internet. The proposed approach does not\nrequire a single Internet-wide architecture or\nuniversal deployment. This article presents these\nconcepts and associated functions. The article\nalso describes how IMS can make use of the\nAGAVE platform to offer QoS-enabled multi-\nmedia services.\nThis article is structured as follows. We pre-\nsent the adopted business model. We define net-\nwork plane and parallel Internet concepts and\nprovide examples of techniques to implement\nthem. We describe the AGAVE functional archi-\ntecture. Finally, we highlight the invoked\nAGAVE functional blocks when deploying two\nscenarios of NP\/PI realization.\nREFERENCE BUSINESS MODEL\nThe emergence of new players, such as Skype\nand Yahoo! in the telephony service market, as\nwell as the trend for traditional telcos to migrate\ntheir services to run over all-IP networks, is\nindicative of the separation of service and net-\nwork planes. This is leading to a distinction\nbetween the service provider (SP) and the IP\nnetwork provider (INP) business roles (Fig. 1).\nIt should be noted that business roles do not\nnecessarily map one-to-one to distinct business\nentities; a business entity may implement more\nthan one role.\nINPs offer IP connectivity to SPs and do not\noffer their services directly to end customers.\nFor expanding the scope of their IP connectivity,\nINPs interact with each other on a one-to-one\nrelationship basis regulated by INP interconnec-\ntion agreements (NIAs). An NIA specifies the\nQoS and availability performance of the traffic\nexchanged between the INPs, the scope and the\nprofile of the traffic entitled to the agreed per-\nformance, and identifiers to capture distinct\nflows for providing differentiated treatment.\nSPs offer IP-based services to end customers.\nSPs deploy the infrastructure required for the\nprovisioning of the offered services, for example,\nVoIP gateways or IP video-servers. To fulfill the\nIP connectivity aspects of their services, SPs\nestablish connectivity provisioning agreements\n(CPAs) with underlying INPs. Similarly to NIAs,\nCPAs specify the performance, constraints, and\nidentifiers of the service traffic entering the INP\nnetwork from the SP sites. Beyond the connec-\ntivity specified therein, the INP offers to the SP\nthe means to control the connectivity provision-\ning, such as setting policing and routing rules\nand receiving feedback reports. The specific pro-\nvisioning rules and required feedback also are\nagreed upon during the CPA negotiation.\nTo expand the scope of offered services, SPs\ninteract with each other on the basis of SP inter-\nconnection agreements (SIAs). The content of\nan SIA is service-specific, for example, a VoIP\nSIA may include telephony performance metrics,\nsuch as average success rate or simultaneous\ncalls capacity.\nCustomers are the target recipients of the\nservices offered by an SP. Services are offered\non the basis of service level agreements (SLAs),\ncapturing the terms and conditions for the provi-\nsion and use of the services.\nn Figure 1.

The NP notion is internal to INPs,\nand its engineering can be undertaken before or\nafter the formulation of service requirements as\nexpressed by SPs. In addition to traditional QoS\nmetrics, such as delay and packet loss, require-\nments such as availability also are considered. It\nis up to the INP to plan\/select\/(re-)engineer its\nNPs to meet these SP requirements. A given NP\ncan be used to convey service traffic managed by\nthe same or distinct SPs in an aggregate fashion.\nTo fulfill the service requirements specified in\nthe CPA, INPs must engineer corresponding\nNPs within their own network. Technically, an\nNP can be engineered through the combined\ntuning of several processes, which span one or\nmore of the following dimensions:\n\u2022 Routing dimension: To support heteroge-\nneous service requirements, different paths\ncan be implemented for individual NPs.\nRouting differentiation can be implemented\nat several levels, for example:\n\u2013Assigning dedicated topologies to maintain\nseveral routing adjacencies towards the des-\ntination.\n\u2013Assigning dedicated path selection configu-\nrations so that multiple path selection con-\nfigurations (e.g., routing metrics) can be\ninstalled, each dedicated to one specific\nNP.3\n\u2013Configuring dedicated fast reroute proce-\ndures for service resilience purposes, such\nas pre-configuring backup paths\/topologies\ninside high availability NPs.\n\u2022 Forwarding dimension: At the forwarding\nlevel, an INP can engineer its IP forwarding\nmechanisms so as to provide different pack-\net scheduling behaviors by configuring dif-\nferent policies in a common scheduler,\nassigning dedicated scheduling resources,\ndifferentiating dropping policies, differenti-\nating failure detection means, and so on.\n\u2022 Resource management dimension: The treat-\nment experienced by IP packets can be dif-\nferentiated by different shaping and\npolicing, as well as the degree of traffic\nmultiplexing, also denoted as the overprovi-\nsioning factor.\nINPs can select the most appropriate combi-\nnation of mechanisms to implement specific NPs\naccording to the service requirements. Further-\nmore, an INP takes into account its own opera-\ntional objectives such as manageability,\nscalability, and resource optimization to provide\ncost-efficient NP realization. In the forwarding\ndimension, DiffServ is a common platform for\nsupporting service differentiation. As far as the\nrouting dimension is concerned, multi-topology\nrouting mechanisms [9\u201312] are regarded as suit-\nable platforms for supporting service differentia-\ntion both within and across NPs. Specifically,\ndedicated routing configuration, such as multi-\ntopology-open shortest path first (OSPF) link\nweight setting, multi-protocol-border gateway\nprotocol (BGP), and QoS-enhanced BGP tweak-\ning, can be performed on top of different rout-\ning topologies, each serving a specific NP.\nAdditionally, other mechanisms can be applied\nfor implementing NPs: by using the functionality\nof explicit routing and resource reservation of\nresource reservation protocol-traffic extension\n(RSVP-TE), dedicated label switched paths can\nbe constructed to support hard QoS guarantees.\nAlternatively, QoS overlay routing and IP tun-\nneling [13] techniques can be used for realizing\nNPs, with less stringent requirements such as\nbetter-than-best-effort services. As far as service\nresilience is concerned, IP\/multiprotocol label\nswitching (MPLS) fast rerouting techniques [14]\ncan be used. A general overview of NP realiza-\ntion is described in Fig. 2.\nThe concept of parallel Internets is introduced\nas an innovative way to enable end-to-end ser-\nvice differentiation across multiple INPs. Specifi-\ncally, PIs are constructed through horizontal\ninterconnection of NPs across individual INPs.\nIn doing so, INPs must negotiate and establish\nNIAs between each other to bind NPs with simi-\nlar service characteristics and apply specific\nmechanisms in the control\/data plane to enforce\nthe realization of individual PIs. Each can have a\ndedicated inter-domain topology, routing policy,\nand forwarding behavior, and so on. A salient\nnovelty of the proposed approach is that each\ninstance of PI is not necessarily implemented\nwith a homogeneous platform across multiple\nINPs. This aspect provides high flexibility for\ncooperating INPs to make local decisions in\nbinding their own NPs to the PI. Later, two\nexamples will be illustrated to show how PIs can\nbe realized in practice.\nAGAVE FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE\nOVERVIEW\nThis section analyzes the interactions between\nthe business roles of customer, SP, and INP and\ndescribes the functional blocks required to sup-\nport these interactions, focusing in particular on\nn Figure 2.

The goal is to mirror\nthe internal organizational structure of a typical\nINP, the steps involved in building NPs and PIs\nto support CPAs and NIAs with SPs and cus-\ntomer INPs, and to model the interactions\nbetween the functional entities.\nThree different perspectives of the INP\noperational activities are identified. The first is\nthe commercial view, which focuses on defining\nand ultimately selling connectivity services to\nSPs and customer INPs. Its main concern is to\nmaximize the profit of the INP. The second\nperspective is concerned with network-wide\noptimization of the INP resources; given the\nservices to be accommodated, their QoS and\navailability requirements, and the anticipated\ndemand. This is where NPs and PIs and their\noverall realization objectives are defined. The\nthird perspective is the one that focuses on\nnetwork engineering and the implementation\nand configuration details of the NPs\/PIs. The\nlater view is heavily dependent on the techno-\nlogical aspects of the mechanisms selected for\nNP realization.\nAlthough all three business processes are\nconcerned with INP management and opera-\ntions, they each have different perspectives and\nconcerns as described previously, and they must\ncommunicate with one another to achieve the\nnetwork-level configurations that ultimately sup-\nport the business objectives of the INP. The\nfunctional architecture facilitates this by defining\nclear boundaries between the entities imple-\nmenting the decision-making processes and spec-\nifying the interactions between them, based on\nissues of common concern. The interactions\nshould be based on information models at an\nappropriate level of abstraction but with suffi-\ncient detail to enable the delegation of tasks\nfrom the higher to lower levels and the reporting\nof state and problems encountered in the reverse\ndirection. The specification of the information\nentities is outside the scope of this article but\ncan be found in [8].\nFigure 4 shows the functional blocks of the\nINP. The commercial perspective is handled pri-\nmarily by the business-based network development\nblock, supported by NP emulation and network\ncapabilities discovery\/advertisement. Network-wide\noptimization concerns are dealt with by NP\ndesign and creation, while the detailed network\nengineering and configuration tasks are located\nin NP provisioning and maintenance. The func-\ntional blocks are described in more detail in the\nfollowing paragraphs, and their interactions are\nillustrated through two scenarios in the following\nsection.\nFUNCTIONAL BLOCKS DESCRIPTION\nBusiness-based network development sets the tar-\ngets for the NP engineering components to fulfill,\nspecifically, the network services to be supported\nand the guidelines for handling the demand for\nthese services. Target network services are\nexpressed in terms of QoS and availability per-\nn Figure 4.

A key purpose of NP emulation is to\nallow business-based network development to\nmake deterministic decisions on the introduction\nof new services, increasing\/reducing the traffic\nload of existing services, and other what-if sce-\nnarios by examining the impact of these changes\non network performance and ultimately prof-\nitability, without the requirement to be aware of\nthe technical details of how the services are engi-\nneered\/deployed.\nThe NP design and creation functional block\nis responsible for the off-line dimensioning of\nnetwork planes prior to their actual configura-\ntion into the operational network of an INP. The\ndesign and creation phase produces high level\nspecifications of the network planes in terms of\nqualitative and quantitative parameters associat-\ned with routing, forwarding, and resource man-\nagement dimensions. Therefore, the role of NP\ndesign and creation includes the definition of\nNPs in terms of their targeted QoS and avail-\nability capabilities and realization guidelines spe-\ncific to the employed technologies to fulfill the\nbusiness-based network development targets.\nNP provisioning and maintenance undertakes\nthe actual realization of network planes and par-\nallel Internets and produces the appropriate net-\nwork configuration, based on the technologies\nselected and the realization guidelines provided\nby the NP design and creation. It also produces\nthe appropriate concrete network configuration\ndata and NIA orders to be negotiated and estab-\nlished with neighboring INPs through the ser-\nvices of the NIA ordering block. This information\nis stored in the network configuration and down-\nstream NIAs database in Fig. 4.\nNP mapping produces candidate CPA\/NIA\nmappings to NPs and PIs on the basis of com-\npatibility of the CPA\/NIA requirements to the\ncapabilities of the NPs and PIs. The produced\nCPA\/NIA mappings are used by resource avail-\nability checking to deduce the admission or rejec-\ntion of incoming CPA\/NIA requests by\ncomparing the capacity in the engineered NPs\nwith the demand of the CPA\/NIAs. NP provi-\nsioning and maintenance also uses the CPA\/NIA\nmappings to actually accommodate the\nCPA\/NIA traffic demand. The mappings are\nstored within the CPA\/NIA mappings database\nin Fig. 4.\nData gathered by NP monitoring is used to\ngenerate notifications and reports for the\nCPA\/NIA order handling and CPA\/NIA assurance\nto forward to SPs and upstream INPs, for the\nonline traffic engineering functions in NP provi-\nsioning and maintenance, for resource availability\nchecking to derive appropriate multiplexing fac-\ntors, and for the NP design and creation and NP\nemulation and business-based network develop-\nment functions to formulate a high level view of\nthe network performance.\nAGAVE FUNCTIONAL\nARCHITECTURE AT WORK\nThis section illustrates the invoked functional\nblocks and associated interactions to implement\nNPs and PIs, employing different routing and\nforwarding techniques. The first scenario \u2014\nQoS-inferred parallel Internets is an ideal solu-\ntion for a community of adjacent INPs who want\nto collaborate with one another to offer end-to-\nend QoS across their networks. The second sce-\nnario \u2014 better-than-best-effort service, aims to\nprovide less strict QoS between non-adjacent\ndomains exchanging high traffic volume.\nQOS-INFERRED PARALLEL INTERNETS\nThe following QoS-inferred parallel Internet\nscenario relies on the use of DiffServ, the meta-\nQoS-class [15] concept, and the QoS-enhanced\nBGP protocol [12]:\n\u2022 The meta-QoS-class concept assumes a uni-\nversal understanding of QoS-sensitive appli-\ncation requirements. Because wherever\ncustomers are connected, they experience\nthe same QoS difficulties and are likely to\nexpress similar QoS requirements to their\nrespective providers, these providers are\nlikely to operate similar NPs, each particu-\nlarly designed to support services with the\nsame constraints.\n\u2022 QoS-enhanced BGP is an enriched version\nof the BGP protocol proposed to support\nQoS requirements for the deployment of\nQoS-based services across several domains.\nTwo modes of activation of QoS-enhanced\nBGP to extend the network planes beyond\nthe boundaries of an INP may be envis-\naged: either to configure several QoS-\nenhanced BGP sessions, each dedicated to\na given NP, or to activate a single QoS-\nenhanced BGP session that will multiplex\nreachability information of all involved\nNPs.\nWithin this scenario, each INP domain is\nengineered to support a limited number of per\ndomain behaviors (PDBs) through NP engineer-\ning functions (i.e., NPs are implemented as\nPDBs), for example, one PDB to convey conver-\nsational traffic and one for best-effort traffic.\nThe dimensioning of these PDBs, including indi-\nvidual PHB profiles and associated differentiat-\ned services code point (DSCP) values are\ndefined by NP design and creation and enforced\nwithin networks nodes by NP provisioning and\nmaintenance functions. These PDBs are classi-\nfied to well-known meta-QoS-classes by the NP\ndesign and creation. Each INP advertises,\nthrough its network-capabilities advertisement\nfunction, the meta-QoS-classes it supports.\nOther INPs can discover these capabilities\nthrough network-capabilities discovery and\ntherefore request NIAs with the advertising INP\nto make use of the offered meta-QoS-class via\nthe invocation of an NIA ordering\/NIA order\nhandling interface. When NIAs agree (results of\nNIA ordering and NIA order handling), each\npeering INP activates QoS-enhanced BGP per\nmeta-QoS-class through NP provisioning and\nmaintenance functions. The resulting QoS-\nNP provisioning and\nmaintenance \nundertakes the \nactual realization of\nnetwork planes and\nparallel Internets and\nproduces the \nappropriate network\nconfiguration, based\non the technologies\nselected and the\nrealization guidelines\nprovided by the NP\ndesign and creation.\nBOUCADAIR LAYOUT  8\/21\/07  1:36 PM  Page 139\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The NIA\nagreement for a meta-QoS-class makes it possi-\nble for INPs to benefit from their neighbor\u2019s\ninter-domain QoS capabilities and enables them\nto reach anywhere in the QoS-Internet for that\nspecific meta-QoS-class. The NP mapping func-\ntion assigns identifiers (one for incoming traffic\nand another one for outgoing traffic) to be used\nin the inter-domain links. These identifiers\nenable the identification of the local PDB to be\nused to treat the traffic and therefore, the PI in\nwhich flows will be routed.\nBETTER-THAN-BEST-EFFORT SERVICE\nIn this second scenario, we combine multi-topol-\nogy routing and IP tunneling techniques to\nimprove inter-domain forwarding performance.\nWe illustrate this combination based on the fol-\nlowing example (Fig. 5). A company uses VoIP\nto place calls between its sites that are geograph-\nically spread in multiple domains owned by dif-\nferent INPs (AS1 and AS2). Its objectives are to\nminimize the end-to-end delay between its sites\nand simultaneously to balance the traffic load at\neach site.\nTo achieve the company\u2019s objectives, two dif-\nferent network planes are used in each INP\nwhere the site is located: NP1, dedicated to low\nlatency service that accounts for a small propor-\ntion over the overall traffic and NP2, used for\nbest-effort traffic. It is the role of NP design and\ncreation to define the NPs and specify how each\nNP is implemented. In this example, the Multi-\nTopology Internet Gateway Protocol (MT-IGP)\nsupports two sets of link weights, one that is\noptimized for providing the lowest latency intra-\ndomain paths and the other that is designed to\nbalance the overall traffic load within the\ndomain. NP mapping is responsible for assigning\ntraffic flows to a specific NP according to the\nconstraints handled by the CPA order handling.\nTraffic flows between Session Initiation Protocol\n(SIP) proxy servers and between VoIP cus-\ntomers, and their outbound\/inbound SIP proxy\nservers are attached to NP1; other traffic flows\nare attached to NP2. The assignment of traffic\nflows onto NPs can be based on packet fields\n(DSCP or source\/destination ports). Based on\nthese assignments, we know the part of the traf-\nfic matrix that is supported by each NP.\nGiven the fact that individual INPs contain-\ning the company sites are not necessarily adja-\ncent to each other, it is not possible to achieve\nstrict end-to-end delay between these sites only\nby the two ends of the INP along the entire\ninter-domain path without interfering with inter-\nmediate domains. As to what concerns the bind-\ning between the NPs in different INPs containing\nthese sites, it is the responsibility of the central-\nized tunneling service controller (TSC) installed\ninside each INP to discover and select the inter-\ndomain paths with the best monitored one-way\ndelay between the local and remote sites for the\ntraffic assigned to NP1. The TSC service can be\nrun on a separate workstation or as part of a\nrouter. TSC implements the following functional\nblocks: network capabilities discovery and adver-\ntisement, NP monitoring, and NP provisioning\nand maintenance. The operation of the TSC is\nas follows. First, the TSC discovers the possible\ningress routers of the remote sites due to net-\nwork capabilities discovery and advertisement. A\ncommunication is established with each remote\nsite to discover its ingresses. Based on an explo-\nration of the BGP routes received by the local\nAS border routers, the TSC identifies the egress\nrouters that can reach the ingresses in the other\nsites. Then, the TSC performs a measurement of\nthe latency between each pair of local egress and\nremote ingress requests (NP monitoring). Con-\nsequently, it selects the lowest delay paths. Final-\nly, the inter-site paths are configured in the\nnetwork, using the NP provisioning and mainte-\nnance block. If tunnels are required, NIAs are\nestablished with the corresponding remote sites\nthat result in tunnel establishment. Additionally,\nlocal routers must be configured to forward NP1\ntraffic destined to remote sites through the\nselected paths. In the example of Fig. 5, the\ndefault routes selected by BGP to reach AS2\nfrom AS1 have the longer delays (50 ms). A tun-\nnel can be used to reach AS2 through a lower\ndelay path (30 ms), exiting AS1 at R3 and enter-\ning AS2 at R6.\nThe off-line traffic engineering (TE) engine\nin NP provisioning and maintenance selects the\nIGP link weights that must be configured in the\nrouting topology supporting each NP. The objec-\ntive of the TE engine is to minimize the delay\nn Figure 5.

A typical realization of this optimiza-\ntion is to assign link weights to the routing topol-\nogy of NP1 so as to select minimum delay paths\nand to assign link weights to the topology sup-\nporting NP2 to spread the traffic load within the\nnetwork.\nIMS INTERACTION WITH AGAVE\nAGAVE offers an open interface for an SP to\nexpress its service requirements including QoS\nand availability. Owing to this interface, an SP\nneed not be aware of the IP engineering oper-\nations executed by the underlying INP. The\nIMS-based SP can indicate its service require-\nments through CPAs, and there is no longer a\nneed to define the bearer classes4 for IP clouds.\nUnderlying INPs run their NP design and cre-\nation machinery to meet these requirements.\nThe process is transparent for an IMS-based\nSP, decoupling VoIP signaling from the tech-\nniques that ensure QoS at the IP level. With\nthis approach, IP resources are not reserved\nper call but per call aggregates and the IMS\nfunctions, for example, policy decision func-\ntion (PDF) or resource admission control\nfunction (RACF), perform only a service-level\naccess control  and therefore abandon the\nreservation per session mode. The IMS-based\nSP verifies if the VoIP service platform can\naccommodate the call, based only on informa-\ntion such as the number of active sessions and\nthe number of supported simultaneous ses-\nsions (especially within nodes embedding bor-\nder gateway function (BGF), such as session\nborder controllers (SBCs).\nFigure 6a illustrates an IMS-based telephony\nservice provider in which BGF nodes are inter-\nconnected through the infrastructure of an INP\nsupporting several network planes. Connectivity\nprovisioning aspects are negotiated between the\nIMS-based telephony SP and the underlying NP\nincluding code points (e.g., DSCP) for marking\nthe SP generated traffic. To honor the IMS SP\nconnectivity requirements (including QoS and\nrobustness), the underlying INP engineers an NP\nsuitable for transport of conversational services\ntraffic. The creation of the NP is opaque to the\nIMS SP. We provide examples of engineering\nNPs.\nTo benefit from these connectivity guaran-\ntees, the BGF nodes must mark the outbound\ntraffic with the DSCP code(s) as agreed during\nthe CPA phase. When this traffic enters the INP\ndomain, it is classified accordingly and is bound\nto the conversational services NP. This traffic is\nthen delivered to the next BGF node and guar-\nantees are met due to the NP technical realiza-\ntions means.\nTo offer QoS-enabled conversational services\nworld-wide, IMS-based SPs must interconnect\ntogether but also require that the underlying IP\ninfrastructure be engineered in an appropriate\nmanner. Due to the deployment of parallel\nInternets, a coherent end-to-end QoS treatment\nis provided across several INPs. Concretely and\nfor illustration purposes, IMS SP1 and IMS SP2\nshould agree CPAs with their respective underly-\ning INPs. QoS, robustness, and the scope of the\nguarantees are part of these CPAs. These CPAs\nare implemented by engineering corresponding\nNPs and their binding with external ones to\nbuild a PI as illustrated in Fig. 6b. Owing to the\ndeployment of this PI, conversational traffic will\nbenefit from an inter-domain QoS treatment.\nNote that two scenarios for building this PI are\nprovided in a previous section. The first scenario\nis suitable for strict QoS guarantees, and every\nintermediate domain must have a VoIP-friendly\nNP. The second scenario provides enhanced\nQoS but without guarantees (intermediate\ndomains are not assumed to implement VoIP-\nfriendly NPs), and best effort treatment is suffi-\ncient.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis article has proposed an approach to ease\nthe introduction of differentiated services not\nonly by performing at the forwarding level but\nalso by tuning multi-dimensional techniques at\nthe routing and resource management levels.\nThe concepts of network plane and parallel\nInternets are introduced.

In\nI210 ISDN Recommen-\ndation (1993), bearer ser-\nvices are introduced as\nopposed to teleservices. A\nbearer service is a network\npoint-to-point relation-\nship. In IP networks, this\nnotion has no real mean-\ning; any host is ready to\ncommunicate with any\nother host in the world,\nand when a communica-\ntion is established between\ntwo hosts, it normally\nbrings no particular states\nin the network (according\nto the so-called fate shar-\ning property). That would\nmean a host always has\nbearer services with all\nother stations in the Inter-\nnet.\nTo offer \nQoS-enabled \nconversational \nservices world-wide,\nIMS-based SPs must\ninterconnect \ntogether but also\nrequire that the\nunderlying IP \ninfrastructure be\nengineered in an\nappropriate manner.\nBOUCADAIR LAYOUT  8\/21\/07  1:36 PM  Page 141\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The adopted business model\nassumes a decoupling between the service\nprovider and IP network provider roles. In addi-\ntion, the AGAVE functional architecture is\ndescribed, including the functions required to\noffer differentiated services. Functions for engi-\nneering network planes and parallel Internets in\norder to satisfy heterogeneous QoS require-\nments set by SPs are presented in detail. Two\nscenarios to build parallel Internets are provid-\ned. The first scenario is based on the use of\nPDB, meta-QoS-class, and QoS-enhanced BGP.\nThe second scenario employs a combination of\nmulti-topology routing and IP tunneling tech-\nniques. This article also identified QoS problems\nin 3GPP architecture and proposed a framework\nto ease the implementation of QoS-enabled mul-\ntimedia services.\nThe merits of the presented approach are as\nfollows. First, it advocates decoupling service\nfunctions from control functions by specifying\nsimplified interfaces between the two. Second, it\nis lightweight for the SP because the complexity\nis pushed to the INP. Third, the approach is\ndeterministic due to the presence of the NP emu-\nlation function, which assesses the status of the\nnetwork and evaluates the impact of introducing\nnew NPs and accepting new IP-connectivity pro-\nvisioning requests. Fourth, it abolishes the\nnode-centric provisioning\/configuration\napproach in favor of network-based configura-\ntion, because the NP provisioning and mainte-\nnance generates the whole NP configuration,\nensuring configuration consistency. Fifth, INP\neasily can evaluate the interference between ser-\nvice activation requests based on the analysis of\nservice requirements.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was undertaken in the Information\nSociety Technologies (IST) AGAVE project,\nwhich is partially funded by the European Com-\nmission.
