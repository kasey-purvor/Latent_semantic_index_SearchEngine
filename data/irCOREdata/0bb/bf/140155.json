INTRODUCTION\nOver the past decade micro and nanofluidics have emerged as vital tools in the ongo-\ning drive towards the development of nano-scale analysis and manufacturing systems. As\nthe devices\u2019 operational dimensions are downsized to micro and nano scales the surface-to-\nvolume ratio increases and the interfacial interactions dominate the flow phenomena. The\nsurface interactions effects are macroscopically formulated via appropriate boundary condi-\ntions. In the majority of the macroscale flows the fluid is considered to be immobile near\nthe solid boundary; however as the scales shrink a number of experimental studies [1\u20133] re-\nvealed the presence of slippage. In these cases, where the continuum no-slip approximation\nbreaks down, the slip\u2019s magnitude is quantified through a parameter named as slip length\n(Ls =\nuslip\n\u2202u\/\u2202n\n), which represents the extrapolated distance from the wall to the point with zero\ntangential velocity component. Surface structure, wettability and, nanoscale roughness are\nsome of the factors that have been recognised to affect slippage phenomena [4, 5]. Generally,\nthe parameters that contribute to slip generation along with their implications to the slip\u2019s\nmagnitude are not explicitly known and fully understood [6]. Therefore, identifying and\nquantifying their impact poses a great challenge that will assist the development of micro\nand nanofluidic devices.\nHigh fidelity computational modelling has been embraced to compliment experiments\nrelated to slippage effects, primarily due to accuracy and precision difficulties involved in\nmeasuring physical quantities at nano scales. Specifically, molecular dynamics [7\u201310] (MD)\nsimulations, have been employed to study the slip\u2019s mechanism and enlighten the impact of\nparameters such as nanoroughness or surface wettability to the slip\u2019s magnitude.\nIt is commonly recognised [6] that surface corrugation can greatly influence the interfacial\nflow characteristics. However, it is still unclear whether it contributes towards slip or stick\nconditions, since experimental evidence [3, 11, 12] suggests that both possibilities exist.\nNumerically, although a number of studies [13, 14] have been performed, the slip\u2019s decreased\nor increased rate as a factor of roughness, has not been fully quantified. An important\ncomponent for the slip process, that may elucidate the variability of the experimental and\nnumerical outcomes, is surface stiffness. In the current study MD simulations are employed\nto study the slip length\u2019s dependency on the wall stiffness for a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid.\n2\nII. SIMULATION METHOD\nThe computational domain considered for the current numerical experiments consists of\nmonoatomic fluid particles confined by two stationary thermal walls separated by distance\nLy along the y direction. The size of the computational domain is Lx = 16.97\u03c3, Ly = 34.64\u03c3\nand Lz = 6.53\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the molecular length scale; and periodic boundary conditions are\napplied in the parallel to the walls directions x and z. The interatomic interactions among\nthe fluid molecules are modelled through a LJ potential which for a pair of molecules i, j\nwith distance rij is\n\u03bdLJij (rij) = 4\u00b2\n[\n(\u03c3\/rij)\n12 \u2212 (\u03c3\/rij)6\n]\n(1)\nwhere \u00b2 is the characteristic energy level. All the interatomic interactions are truncated at\na cut-off distance rc = 2.2\u03c3. The fluid\u2019s density is selected to be \u03c1fluid = 0.81 m\u03c3\n\u22123, where\nm is the mass of a fluid\u2019s molecule, and corresponds to the generation of 2880 particles. A\nconstant external force fx, along the x direction, is applied to each fluid molecule to drive\nthe flow. The simulations have been performed for a range of force\u2019s values spanning from\nfx = 0.005 \u00b2\u03c3\n\u22121 to fx = 0.015 \u00b2\u03c3\u22121 with step 0.0025 \u00b2\u03c3\u22121. The velocity profile from a\ncontinuum hydrodynamics perspective, assuming a slip velocity uslip at the solid boundary,\nis\nux(y) = 0.5\u00b5\n\u22121\u03c1fx\n[\n(Ly\/2)\n2 \u2212 y2]+ uslip (2)\nThe parabolic velocity profile, described by Eq. 2, implies that the shear rate is proportional\nto the applied force and consequently force\u2019s variations corresponds to subsequent adjust-\nments of the shear rate. Previous computational studies [7, 9, 15] have indicated a non linear\nrelationship between the shear rate and the slip length. Therefore, aiming to minimise the\nshear rate\u2019s influences to the outcome\u2019s variability, the impact of the wall stiffness to the slip\nphenomena is studied for a broad range of shear rates. The magnitude of the applied force\nshould be cautiously selected, since high force values can drive the system out of the linear\nresponse regime [16]. The excessive viscous heating of the system is dissipated through a\nLangevin thermostat [7], applied only in the z direction to circumvent any possible influences\nto the flow direction. The equations of motion along the z direction are\nmz\u00a8i +m\u0393z\u02d9i = \u2212\n\u2211\ni6=j\n\u2202Vij\n\u2202zi\n+ \u03b7i (3)\n3\nwhere \u03b7i is a Gaussian distributed random force with zero mean < \u03b7i(t) >= 0 and variance\n< \u03b7i(0)\u03b7j(t) >= 2mkBT\u0393\u03b4(t)\u03b4ij, where T = 1.1 \u00b2k\n\u22121\nB is the fluid\u2019s temperature. The\nfriction coefficient has been selected to be \u0393 = 1.0 \u03c4\u22121 throughout the simulations, aiming\nto minimise any undesirable effects to the self diffusion coefficient [9, 17]. The equations of\nmotion are integrated through a velocity-Verlet algorithm [18] with time step \u03b4t = 0.001\u03c4 .\nA total number of 6 \u00b7 105 time steps have been performed for equilibration and afterwards\nanother 6 \u00b7 105 for averaging.\nEach of the solid walls is modelled as two (111) fcc lattice planes with density \u03c1wall =\n4.0m\u03c3\u22123 corresponding to 528 particles with mass equal to the fluid ones. The wall particles\ninteract with the fluid through a LJ potential with energy and length scales \u00b2wf and \u03c3wf\nrespectively. Generally, slippage phenomena are sensitive to the wall-fluid interactions and,\nparticularly, as the wall\u2019s surface energy decreases, the amount of momentum transferred\nacross the interface decreases leading to larger slip values [7]. Therefore, the effects of surface\nstiffness are studied for two sets of interfacial parameters (i) \u00b2wf = 0.2\u00b2, \u03c3wf = 0.75\u03c3 and\n(ii) \u00b2wf = 0.4\u00b2, \u03c3wf = 0.75\u03c3. Every wall particle i is attached to its equilibrium lattice site\nr0 with an elastic spring force\nF = \u2212\u03ba (ri \u2212 r0) (4)\nwhere \u03ba is the wall\u2019s stiffness. Stiffness is a pivotal parameter that provides a link between\nthe wall model and real materials and determines the wall\u2019s physical properties. Its values\nreveal the strength of particles\u2019 bonds and larger rates are related to higher melting points\nand Young\u2019s modulus. Their selection should not allow (i) the mean square displacement\nof the wall atoms to be larger than the Lidemann criterion of melting [9, 19] and (ii) the\nmovement of the wall\u2019s atoms to be in a regime that cannot be entirely addressed in the\nmolecular simulation\u2019s time step [9]. For the current study \u03ba ranges from \u03ba = 100 \u00b2\u03c3\u22122 to\n\u03ba = 1200 \u00b2\u03c3\u22122; this interval is consistent with typical \u03bamagnitudes employed in previous MD\nstudies [9, 20, 21]. Although it is not straight forward to establish exact relations between\nsimplified models, such as the one employed here for the wall, and real physical substances,\nthe selected values of solid\u2019s stiffness corresponds to a broad range of real materials including\nsilicon based structures, that are primarily used for microfluidic fabrications and typically\ntheir Young modulus is lower compared to the metals one [22]. The wall temperature is\nkept constant equal to Twall = 1.1 \u00b2k\n\u22121\nB during the simulations through a velocity rescaling\nthermostat [23].\n4\nIn the employed model the walls\u2019 particles are allowed to vibrate around their crystalline\nsites based on a spring potential. Consequently, due to the absence of inter-atomic inter-\nactions, there is no solid elasticity in the wall and therefore, this model tends to neglect\nthe molecular diffusion. Despite the absence of solid elasticity the thermal vibrations of\nthe wall particles, that are frequently neglected in molecular studies [24, 25], are simulated\neffectively. Although this type of thermal walls is expected to provide slightly overestimated\nfigures for the slip, due to the absence of solid elasticity, is widely adopted [24, 25] in the\nliterature. In more sophisticated models, where the wall particles are not anchored to their\nlattice sites, the presence of inter-atomic interactions and molecular diffusion in the wall\nalters the original structure of the lattice and therefore, additional nanoscale roughness is\nintroduced affecting the frictional coefficient. Outcomes from previous MD studies show\nsmall variations between models with and without solid elasticity [9, 26, 27].\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 1 shows examples of averaged fluid density profiles under different values of surface\nstiffness. These simulations have been carried out with interaction parameters \u00b2wf = 0.2\u00b2,\n\u03c3wf = 0.75\u03c3 and an external driving force fx = 0.0075 \u00b2\u03c3\n\u22121. A common element observed\nin the density distributions is their profound oscillations near the solid wall. Despite the\nchanges in the surface stiffness, the density follows the same pattern, since the locations\nof its local maxima and minima remain almost constant, and rests to its bulk value after\n(5 \u2212 7) \u03c3. The variation of the spring stiffness primarily influences the density\u2019s absolute\nmaximum value and for the simulations considered in Fig. 1 this value increases, with a non\nlinear manner, as \u03ba increases from \u03ba = 100 \u00b2\u03c3\u22122 to \u03ba = 600 \u00b2\u03c3\u22122. Furthermore, deviations\nbetween the outcomes are reduced as higher surface stiffness rates are employed in the\nnumerical simulations (see Fig. 1). Smaller \u03ba implies that the wall particles oscillate around\ntheir equilibrium positions with higher amplitude and lower frequency and therefore the fluid\nmolecules can potentially travel closer to the solid wall [9]. As a consequence, a broader\ndensity profile is observed near the first peak. However, as the spring stiffness \u03ba increases its\ninfluence on the wall particles oscillations is primarily related to oscillation frequency rather\nthan oscillation amplitude, which is mainly determined by the wall temperature [23]. Thus,\nits impact on the in-plane fluid\u2019s layering and hence on the density\u2019s profile is less apparent.\n5\ny\/Ly\n\u03c1\n(m\n\u03c3\n-\n3 )\n0.05 0.1 0.15 0.20\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n\u03ba= 600 \u03b5\u03c3-2\n\u03ba= 300 \u03b5\u03c3-2\n\u03ba= 100 \u03b5\u03c3-2\nFIG. 1: Density profiles near the lower wall for various values of the spring stiffness \u03ba with\nfx = 0.0075 \u00b2\u03c3\n\u22121, \u00b2wf = 0.2\u00b2.\nFigure 2 shows the variation of the slip length for a certain value of stiffness \u03ba = 900 \u00b2\u03c3\u22122\nas a function of the driving force fx. Previous MD studies [7, 9] report that the slip length\u2019s\nvariations are well described by a power law function\nLs(fx) = L\n0\ns (1\u2212 fx\/fc)\u22120.5 (5)\nwhere L0s represents a asymptotical value of the slip length as the shear rate tends to zero\nand fc corresponds a critical driving force value. As the driving force approaches this critical\nvalue fc, the slip length appears to diverge[7]. In Fig. 2 the computational uncertainty in the\nslip length calculations is approximately 3%. The simulation data were fitted through Eq. 5\nand the obtained parameters for \u00b2wf = 0.2\u00b2 and \u00b2wf = 0.4\u00b2 are L\n0\ns = 11.33\u03c3, fc = 0.0174\u00b2\u03c3\n\u22121,\nand L0s = 6.88\u03c3, fc = 0.021\u00b2\u03c3\n\u22121 respectively. In Fig. 2 it is noticed that the calculated slip\nlengths are in good agreement with analytical descriptions derived by previous studies [7, 9]\nand it is shown that the change rate of the slip length increases as the driving force moves\ntowards to its critical value.\n6\n0.004 0.008 0.012 0.016\nf\nx\n(\u03b5\u03c3-1)\nL s\n(\u03c3\n)\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n\u03b5\nwf=0.2\u03b5\n\u03b5\nwf=0.4\u03b5\nFIG. 2: Slip length variations with length Ls as a function of the driving force fx for wall\nparticles with stiffness \u03ba = 900 \u00b2\u03c3\u22122; the dashed curves are the best fitting to\nLs(fx) = L\n0\ns (1\u2212 fx\/fc)\u22120.5.\nFigure 3 shows an example of the slip length as a function of surface stiffness. In the\nperformed molecular simulations the interaction parameters are \u00b2wf = 0.4\u00b2, \u03c3wf = 0.75\u03c3\nand the external driving force is fx = 0.01 \u00b2\u03c3\n\u22121. In Fig. 3 the slip length has been scaled\nover the parameter L0, which represents the slip length when a fixed lattice wall is employed.\nIn this wall model the solid particles are immobilised in their lattice sites and, therefore,\nare not allowed to vibrate [7, 23]. Figure 3 shows that the slip varies along with the surface\nstiffness indicating its importance to the slip process. It is visible that for the less stiff\nsurfaces, such as \u03ba = 100 \u00b2\u03c3\u22122 for the example of Fig. 3, the degree of slip is smaller\ncompared to the one calculated when a fixed lattice wall is employed. Smaller values of \u03ba\nimply larger displacements of the wall particles resulting to an increased surface roughness.\nIn this case the interactions between the wall\u2019s and fluid\u2019s particles are enhanced leading\n7\nto improved momentum transfer and consequently to less slippage. As \u03ba increases the\nwall\u2019s surface becomes effectively smoother and higher slip is produced. However, it can\nbe observed in Fig. 3 that the slip length, instead of increasing monotonically with the\nwall\u2019s stiffness, it obtains a maximum value Ls,max and then starts to decline. Although\nstiffer walls are employed the impact of bonding stiffness to the oscillation amplitude of\nthe walls\u2019 particles is continuously decreasing. The amplitude, as already mentioned, is\nprimarily dictated from walls\u2019 temperature and therefore \u03ba is no longer a dominant factor\nfor the surface smoothness or roughness. In these cases, increasing the values of \u03ba alters\nthe oscillation frequency towards higher values that contribute to a more efficient interfacial\nmomentum transfer and consequently to a reduction in the slip length. This is justified for\nvalues of stiffness \u03ba that lead to oscillating periods Toscill higher than the mean molecular\ncollision time (\u03c4coll); for the current study this is valid for \u03ba < 2000 \u00b2\u03c3\n\u22122.\nThe relative growth and decay of the mean frequency and amplitude respectively, as a\nfunction of \u03ba are shown in Fig. 4. These variations are calculated as (f\u03ba \u2212 f\u03ba=100)\/f\u03ba=100\nand (d\u03ba=100 \u2212 d\u03ba)\/d\u03ba=100, where f corresponds to the mean oscillating frequency and d\nto the mean vibrating amplitude of the wall particles. The values for \u03ba = 100 \u00b2\u03c3\u22122 are\nf\u03ba=100 = 1.672 1\/\u03c4 , corresponding to a mean oscillation time Toscill,\u03ba=100 = 0.598 \u03c4 , and\nd\u03ba=100 = 5.3 \u00b7 10\u22124 \u03c3. Figure 4 shows that for higher stiffness values there is almost a\nlinear increase for the frequency and concurrently the decay rate of the mean displacement\napproaches to zero.\nSimilar behaviour has been observed in all the performed simulations regardless the vari-\nous wall-fluid interactions or shear rates employed. The results of the numerical experiments\nare summarised in Fig. 5. Here, the slip length has been scaled over the Ls,max, which rep-\nresents its maximum value in a series of simulations with the same interaction parameters,\ndriving force and variable \u03ba. The stiffness has been scaled over the \u03bamax, which represents\nthe value of \u03ba that maximises the slip. It is apparent that the parameters Ls,max and \u03bamax\ndepend upon the various simulations conditions such as shear rate or surface attraction en-\nergy. Figure 5 shows that the effect of the wall\u2019s stiffness to the slip process can be well\nquantified by a master curve, which in our case is a fifth order polynomial\nLS\nLS,max\n= a+ b \u00b7 \u03ba\n\u03bamax\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ f \u00b7\n(\n\u03ba\n\u03bamax\n)5\n(6)\nwhere a = 0.01,b = 2.59, c = \u22121.68, d = \u22120.77, e = 1.16 and f = \u22120.32.

Potentially the master curve\ncan be extended to accommodate the variation of Ls,max and \u03bamax as functions of other\nparameters that are important to the slip process, like for example the shear rate.\nIV. CONCLUDING OVERVIEW\nIn summary, this study has investigated the relationship between the wall stiffness and\nthe slip produced. For the first time we show that the slip length variations as a function of\nsurface stiffness can be approximated and well described through a master curve. Quantify-\ning the dependence of Ls on \u03ba provides a mechanism for obtaining a better insight in the slip\nphenomena and reducing the variability regarding the values of surface stiffness employed\nin molecular simulations.

Specifically, the combined effects of wall particles\u2019 mass with\nthe surface stiffness are studied along with more realistic models for the thermal walls.\n[1] C. Choi, K. Westin, and K.
