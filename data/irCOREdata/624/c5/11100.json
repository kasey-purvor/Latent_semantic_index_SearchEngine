Regarding stock markets, the cost of\ncarry model predicts that stock futures prices should comove with spot prices (Taylor et al., 2000).\nFurther, loglinear present value models imply a linear relationship between log dividends and\nprices (Campbell and Shiller, 1988). Similarly in the housing market, as long as that the real value\nof residential property is a constant proportion of the expected value of future real disposable\nincome, the house price to income ratio should be stable (Black et al., 2006).\nHowever, in most cases the results of empirical research based on linear unit root tests are\ndiscouraging. Deviations from fundamental values appear to wonder with no apparent tendency\nto revert to a single equilibrium point. This is in sharp contrast to the theory. During the last\ntwo decades numerous theoretical and empirical contributions have attempted to provide possible\nexplanations for this empirical regularity. An important finding of these studies is that the failure\nto find economically meaningful results may be attributed to the assumption of linearity. Linear\nunit root tests may result in misleading inference in the presence of nonlinear dynamics regarding\nthe mechanism characterizing the macroeconomy and asset markets.\nA family of nonlinear models which is gaining popularity in finance and macroeconomics is the\nsmooth transition autoregressive (STAR). The STAR functional form has three particularly appeal-\ning features. First, it is in line with the presence of limits to arbitrage in financial and commodity\nmarkets due to market frictions, uncertainty regarding equilibrium asset prices and heterogeneous\nagents which make deviations from equilibrium and arbitrage conditions inherently nonlinear and\npersistent. To this end, applications of the STAR process include modeling deviations from the\ncovered interest parity (Peel and Taylor, 2002), spot-futures relationship (Sarno and Monoyios,\n2002), dividend-price ratios (Gallagher and Taylor, 2001), deviations of nominal exchange rates\nfrom the equilibrium value suggested by the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) (Michael et al., 1997;\n2\nTaylor et al., 2001; Kilian and Taylor, 2003), as well as optimal money holdings (Sarno et al.,\n2003).\nSecond, this particular type of nonlinear models can display multiple equilibria. This property\nmight turn out to be crucial for capturing the salient aspects of series such as real interest rates\nand inflation. Models of monetary policy rules suggest that once you take into account the zero\nbound on nominal interest rates, real interest rates might follow a number of equilibria (see, e.g.,\nBenhabib et al., 2001). Moreover, in their seminal paper Sargent and Wallace (1973) show that\nwhen authorities print money so as to finance a real budget deficit inflation is a nonlinear process\nwith two equilibria, one stable and the other unstable.1 Moreover, a stylized fact regarding inflation\nis the high persistence of the series. In numerous empirical and theoretical contributions inflation is\nassumed to be a linear integrated of order one, I(1), process. This assumption has severe economic\nand statistical implications. The nominal exchange rate, via PPP, should be an I(2) process, and\nnominal asset returns would exhibit unit root behavior, which is in sharp contrast with the empirical\nfindings.\nThird, STAR models can exhibit complex, possibly chaotic, dynamics. There are a number of\ntheoretical models that suggest this behavior in economics and finance. Day (1982) modifies the\nneoclassical growth model and shows that growth cycles can exhibit an asymmetric saw-toothed\npattern. Grandmont (1985) employs overlapping-generations models so as to illustrate how a de-\nterministic equilibrium model can produce regular asymmetric cycles as well as chaotic dynamics.\nBrock (1988) and De Grauwe et al. (1993) construct heterogeneous agents models which can gen-\nerate similar complex behavior, or even chaos, in asset prices. Moreover, De Grauwe and Grimaldi\n(2006) and Kaizoji (2004) show that the presence of heterogeneous agents can lead to the genera-\ntion of speculative bubbles in asset prices and financial crises. Chapell (1997) shows how a discrete\nversion of the Sargent and Wallace (1973) model of hyper-inflation can exhibit both complex and\n1In the case that agents form adaptive expectations the lower equilibrium is stable but not the higher, ruling out\nsteady states of high inflation. However, Evans et al. (1996) illustrate that two stable solutions can occur and, therefore,\na stable high inflation state may arise with adaptive learning.\n3\nchaotic dynamics. All these arguments motivate a nonlinear adjustment mechanism with possi-\nble multiple equilibria and complex dynamics such as the one provided by the smooth transition\nregression model. Some of the properties of STAR models are illustrated below, in Section 2.\nGiven the widespread application of ESTAR models to time series which are highly persistent it\nis useful to examine the properties of a unit root test which derives from this family, and compare it\nwith more general unit root tests. Kapetanios et al. (2003) (KSS hereafter) propose a testing proce-\ndure so as to formally distinguish between nonlinear single equilibria globally stationary processes\nand unit root processes. On the basis of Monte Carlo simulation experiments the authors conclude\nthat their procedure improves substantially upon existing tests. In particular, their nonlinear unit\nroot test appears to have better power properties that the standard Augmented Dickey-Fuller test,\nADF hereafter, and the statistic proposed by Enders and Granger (1998), EG hereafter.\nIn Section 3 of this paper we attempt to extend the analysis of KSS in three directions. First, we\nemploy a different range of parameter values than the ones considered initially by Kapetanios et al..\nThe new range approximates the range of values typically reported in the empirical literature and\ncorresponds to ESTAR processes which exhibit more closely unit root like behavior. Second, we\nexamine the impact of uncertainty regarding the presence of deterministic components in the Data\nGenerating Process (DGP) on the performance of the test. Clearly, researchers are often ignorant\nand in many cases have no priors about the true DGP so that they have to rely on hypothesis testing\nto determine the significance of deterministic components.2 Finally, we investigate further the\nimpact of multiple equilibria on the performance of the nonlinear test. This exercise is interesting\ngiven that the test is based on the assumption of a single equilibrium point.\nSection 4 examines the performance of the unit root tests on financial and macroeconomic time\nseries that have been suggested to follow nonlinear processes as mentioned above.\n2Given that ESTAR models can exhibit spurious constants and trends (see Paya and Peel, 2003), the examination\nof the impact of the specification procedure on the performance of nonlinear tests appears important.\n4\n2 Modeling Nonlinear Economic & Financial Dynamics with\nthe STAR model\nA typical Exponential STAR (ESTAR) model for a univariate time series yt is given by\nyt = \u03b2yt\u22121 + \u03b3yt\u22121\n[\n1\u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b8y2t\u2212d)\n]\n+ \u01ebt,\nor, equivalently,\n\u2206yt = \u03c6yt\u22121 + \u03b3yt\u22121\n[\n1\u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b8y2t\u2212d)\n]\n+ \u01ebt, (1)\nwhere \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b8 are constants, \u03c6 = \u03b2 \u2212 1 and \u01ebt \u223c iid(0, \u03c32) is the disturbance term.3 When\n\u03b3 < 0 and \u03c6 + \u03b3 < 0 the process is globally mean reverting although close to the equilibrium it\nmay exhibit unit root or even explosive behavior. As aforementioned, the fact that STAR models\nallow the speed of mean reversion of the process towards the equilibrium to be a function of the\ndistance from the equilibrium is particularly appealing in modeling several macroeconomic and\nfinancial variables. It has been proved that the presence of transactions costs and other market\nfrictions in arbitrage models imply this type of nonlinear adjustment mechanism.\nHowever, for different parameter values the ESTAR model can display multiple equilibria,\ncomplex dynamics and chaotic-like behavior that can lead to misleading conclusion when unit root\ntests are employed. For instance, consider the following model\nyt = 1.1yt\u22121 exp\n(\n\u22128.059(yt\u22121 \u2212 0.175)\n2\n)\n+ \u01ebt (2)\nwhich is globally stationary. Figure 1, which depicts \u2206yt against yt\u22121, shows that the process\nhas three equilibria which correspond to the cases where the curve intersects with the horizontal\naxis. The stable equilibria are given by 0 and 0.283. To shed more light on the properties of\n3The assumption can be relaxed to allow \u01eb to be a martingale difference sequence.\n5\nthe process, we simulate (2) without noise and a starting value of 0.1. The first 100 realizations\nof the series are presented in Figure 2. The process moves from the starting value to the high\nequilibrium with oscillations. This behavior could be mistakenly interpreted as either explosive or\nsuggestive of a time trend in small samples. Figure 3 shows 100 observations of the same process\nwith the noise switched on. It can be observed that the series exhibits high persistence which\nmakes it difficult to distinguish from a process with an intercept and trend, a unit root or even\nan explosive process.4 Lundbergh and Tera\u00a8svirta (2002) conduct a similar simulation experiment\nusing a stationary Logistic STAR model with realizations that fluctuate between two local means.\nTheir overall conclusion is that standard unit root tests when applied to these series do not reject\nthe unit root hypothesis.\nFigures 1, 2 and 3\nMacroeconomic and financial series may in fact exhibit this type of behavior. Byers and Peel\n(2000) motivated by the theoretical literature on inflation dynamics fit ESTAR models to the infla-\ntion series of high-inflation countries. They examine Brazil and Argentina in the second half of the\ntwentieth century and Germany in interwar period.5 Their results support the presence of multiple\nequilibria. In particular, Brazil has a stable high inflation equilibrium, while for the remaining two\ncountries the high inflation state is characterized by inflation cycles. This finding has potential con-\nsequences for asset markets, such as the FX and bond markets, through spillover effects. Exchange\nrates, interests rates and asset returns are linked with prices through e.g. the PPP hypothesis and\nthe Fisher equation.\nThe ESTAR model is also capable of mimicking chaotic type behavior which can arise in\nasset prices through the interaction of chartists and fundamentalists in the market. Heterogeneous\nagents models have been derived for the FX market (De Grauwe et al., 1993), the stock market\n4Note that the ADF test statistic for this particular cannot rejected the null of a unit root at the 5 per cent level.\n5Model 2 corresponds to the estimates for the case of Brazil. Please note that the speed of adjustment coefficient\nin Equation (2) has be scaled by the variance of the series.\n6\n(Huang and Day, 1993) and the housing market (Kouwenberg and Zwinkles, 2010). To illustrate\nthis point, we slightly modify Equation (2) by changing the autoregressive parameter from 1.1 to\n1.5. Figure 4 illustrates the path of the series in the case of no noise for 200 observations. In this\ncase, the series exhibit cycles of 34 periods. Close inspection of the figure would show that the\nvalues of the series do not ever repeat. Figure 5 shows a scatter diagram of yt on yt\u221234 for the whole\n10,000 replications, which corroborates this fact. Clearly, the above could be falsely considered\nas evidence in favor of chaotic behavior. This example highlights the importance of accurate\neconometric estimation and inference when dealing with highly complex dynamics. Coefficients\nvalues within the 95 per cent confidence interval could in fact have radically different economic\nimplications for the series under consideration.\nFigures 4 and 5\nWe have so far demonstrated the flexibility of a simple ESTAR model to nest a number of\nalternative processes with high persistence, spurious trends, multiple equilibria and chaotic-like\nbehavior suggested by different theoretical models in the financial and economic literature. Given\nthe popularity of the ESTAR model, KSS focus on the issue of persistence and propose a test to\ndiscriminate between a linear unit root process and a globally stationary ESTAR. The next section\nextends the work of KSS in examining its performance in cases of extreme persistence, multiple\nequilibria and no priors regarding the Data Generating Process (DGP) deterministic components.\n3 Kapetanios et al. (2003) Test\nConsider Equation (1) and let \u03c6 = 0 and d = 1, it follows that\n\u2206yt = \u03b3yt\u22121\n[\n1\u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b8y2t\u22121)\n]\n+ \u01ebt, (3)\n7\nand by following Luukkonen et al. (1988) and taking a first-order Taylor series approximation\n\u2206yt = \u03b4y\n3\nt\u22121 + ut. (4)\nUnder the null hypothesis of a linear unit root model, H0 : \u03b4 = 0. Whilst, under the alternative\nH1 : \u03b4 < 0. The KSS test statistic is given by\ntNL =\n\u03b4\u02c6\ns.e.(\u03b4\u02c6)\n, (5)\nand converges weakly to a functional of Brownian motions.\nIn the presence of serial correlation in the residuals Equation (4) is augmented with lags of\nthe dependent variable. Moreover, if the data exhibit an intercept\/trend, y must be replaced by the\ndemean\/detrended series. KSS employs a two step procedure. In the first stage, the researcher,\nwho has a prior regarding the deterministic component characterizing the DGP, runs an Ordinary\nLeast Squares regression of the raw data on an intercept or an intercept and a trend and obtains\nthe residuals (demeaned or detrended series). In turn, the nonlinear unit root test is applied on the\nestimated residuals. However, when there is uncertainty about the presence of the deterministic\ncomponents the econometrician typically regresses the raw data on an intercept or an intercept and\na trend, and the ones that are not significant are omitted. We examine the effect of using hypothesis\ntesting to specify the deterministic components of the DGP on the KSS and the EG test in the next\nsection. It is also noted, that the ADF test is not based on this procedure. The test is always run\nwith the raw data and then specific critical values for different restrictions are tabulated to select\nthe DGP. Next, we follow KSS and compare the power of the tNL statistic with that of the ADF\nand EG test.\n8\n3.1 Monte Carlo Simulation, New Parameter Values\nKSS evaluate the power of their test by employing a DGP with speed of adjustment parameter \u03b8 \u2208\n{0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1}. The findings of recent empirical research (Taylor et al., 2001; Kilian and Taylor,\n2003; Paya et al., 2003) suggest that even lower values of \u03b8 are warranted, in particular, values\naround \u03b8 = 0.001 are also reported in empirical work.6 We employ this value as well as the more\nextreme case of \u03b8 = 0.0001 which is closer to the linear unit root case. Regarding \u03b3 and \u03c6, we set\nthem equal to -1 and 0, which are the values reported or imposed in most empirical research on\nPPP or other arbitrage conditions. The nominal significance level is set equal to 5 per cent for all\nthe experiments implemented in this study and the number of replications equal to 10,000.\nTable 1 reports rejection rates of the unit root hypothesis corresponding to the KSS, EG and\nADF statistics. Case 1, Case 2 and Case 3 correspond to DGPs with no constant, constant and con-\nstant and trend, respectively. The results for the KSS and EG tests presented in Panel A are based\non the procedure advocated by KSS where there are priors regarding the nuisance parameters. Not\nsurprisingly, for relative high values of \u03b8, 0.01, the power of the tNL statistic is always higher or\nsimilar to the power of the ADF and the EG. As the value of \u03b8 decreases the power of all three\nstatistics falls and when \u03b8 reaches 0.001 the power is reduced up to five times. It is important that\nthe reduction in power is generally more severe for the KSS than the ADF so that in some cases\n(and always for \u03b8 = 0.0001) the latter becomes superior to the former.\nTable 1\nWe now turn to Panel B where there is no prior regarding the deterministic components. Before\nwe discuss the results we note that a constant and a trend is often found significant when the DGP\nhas none, which alters the rejection probabilities of the KSS and EG tests.7 Starting with the no\n6In order to make comparisons across models and studies the speed of adjustment parameter must be standardized.\nThat is, it must be divided by the variance of yt\u2212d.\n7For instance, in sample sizes of 100 and 200 around seventy and sixty five per cent of the times, respectively, an\nintercept or a trend are found significant.\n9\nconstant DGP, Case 1, and the KSS test, the broad conclusion that emerges is that specifying the\ndeterministic components on the basis of hypothesis testing results in lower power compared to\nPanel A. This is not always true for the remaining cases and, in particular, for small samples and\nlow values of \u03b8. On the contrary, the EG test exhibits now greater power, especially, in small\nsamples. It is also worth mentioning that now the ADF test outperforms the tNL statistic except in\nCase 3 for \u03b8 = 0.01 and T equal to 100 and 200.8\n3.2 Monte Carlo Simulation, Multiple Equilibria\nIn the previous exercise the ESTAR Model (1) has only one real equilibrium value, y\u00af = 0. How-\never, with \u03c6 = 0.1 and \u03b3 \u2208 {\u22121.5,\u22121,\u22120.5}, which are values employed by KSS, there are three\nequilibria. Specifically, the values of the equilibria are given by\ny\u00af = 0, and y\u00af = \u00b1\n\u221a\n\u2212 ln(\u03c6+\u03b3\n\u03b3\n)\n\u03b8\n.\nThe smaller the \u03b8 the further apart are the inner and outer equilibrium values. Figure 1 depicts\nfour processes of ten thousand random realizations from Model (1) with \u03c6 = 0.1, \u03b3 = \u22121 and\n\u03b8 \u2208 {0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001}. We emphasize that the relationship between the parameter \u03b8 and\nthe degree of persistence appears to be non monotonic in the samples considered. As \u03b8 decreases\nthe equilibria move further apart and the degree of persistence increases since shocks make the\nprocess bounce between equilibria. However, when the equilibria are sufficiently far apart the\nprocess remains in the neighborhood of only one of the equilibria for very long periods until a\nshock of sufficient magnitude bounces it to the other stable equilibria. Hence, the process may\nappear to be less persistent. Therefore, the relationship between the degree of persistence and the\nvalue of \u03b8 is not monotonic which motivates the examination the impact of different values of \u03b8 on\n8The results for the ADF test are the same in Panel A and B due to the fact that the deterministic components are\nalways obtain within the test.\n10\nthe power properties of the tests.\nFigure 6\nThe two Panels of Table 2, report the power of the unit root tests for \u03c6 = 0.1, \u03b3 = \u22121,\nand \u03b8 \u2208 {0.01, 0.001, 0.0001}. Starting with Panel A, which is based on the KSS methodology\noutlined above, and in the case of a constant and a constant and a trend (Cases 2 and 3), it is\ninteresting that the power of all tests increases as \u03b8 decreases. This finding may be attributed to the\nfact that, in small samples, the series with lower \u03b8 hardly ever change their equilibrium value and\nthe persistence in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point is lower for lower values of \u03b8.9 This\nis also the reason that the power corresponding to 1,000 observations is lower than the power for\n350. Note also that for low values of \u03b8 the KSS test performs worst than the competing unit root\ntests. Turning to Case 1, we observe that while the power of the ADF increases as \u03b8 decreases, the\npower of tNL and EG become virtually zero.10\nTable 2\nPanel B of Table 2 reports results for the same parameter values as above but with the speci-\nfication of the deterministic components in the KSS and EG test being determined by hypothesis\ntesting. Two results for the KSS test are worth mentioning. First, the test never displays the high-\nest power except for Case 3 and \u03b8 = 0.01. Second, its power drops with respect to Panel A for\n\u03b8 = 0.01 but improves in the remaining cases.\n9Please note that in Figure 1 the series with \u03b8 = 0.001 is more persistent (the autocorrelation coefficient is \u03c11 =\n0.993) than the series with \u03b8 = 0.01 (\u03c11 = 0.945) for a sample of 10,000 observations. However, the persistence\ndisplayed by the series with \u03b8 = 0.001 is actually lower for small sample sizes similar to the ones used in our Monte\nCarlo (T = 100, 200, 350, 1000). This is due to the fact that, in small samples, the series with lower \u03b8 hardly ever\nchanges its equilibrium value and the persistence \u2018within\u2019 a regime (with \u03c11 around 0.84) is lower than in the case of\n\u03b8 = 0.01 (\u03c11 = 0.945).\n10The power of the EG test is not reported for \u03b8 equal to 0.001 and 0.0001 due to the fact that the generated series\ntake only positive (values) values making the computation of the statistic unfeasible.\n11\nThe overall conclusion of the above results is that the performance of the KSS test is not uni-\nversally better than the EG and the ADF test but depends crucially on the DGP under examination\nand the methodology adopted for specifying the deterministic components of the data. The next\nsection deals with the applications of the three unit root tests on real-world series.\n4 Empirical Applications\nIn the introduction we highlighted the fact that numerous theoretical and empirical contributions\nsuggest that factors such as agent heterogeneity, transactions costs, uncertainty regarding equi-\nlibrium values, or the sunk costs of international arbitrage can induce smooth transition non-\nlinearity in the deviation process of asset prices from their fundamental value in different as-\nset markets (Dumas, 1992; Berka, 2005; Kilian and Taylor, 2001; Gallagher and Taylor, 2001;\nKim and Bhattacharya, 2009). Many studies have further shown that these processes can be par-\nsimoniously modelled by the ESTAR (Michael et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 2001; Kilian and Taylor,\n2003; Sarno and Monoyios, 2002).\nHowever, smooth transition nonlinearity is not constrained to deviations of asset prices from\nfundamentals. Sargent and Wallace (1973) show that when authorities print money so as to finance\na real budget deficit inflation becomes a nonlinear process with multiple equilibria. Evans et al.\n(1996) illustrate further that under adaptive learning a stable high inflation state may arise. To this\nend, Byers and Peel (2000) advocate the use of ESTAR models which allow high persistence of\nthe series as well as multiple equilibria.\nGiven all this evidence it seems interesting to test the properties of a number of series repre-\nsentative of those markets. Our data set consists of five real exchange rates, a house price-income\nratio, a dividend-price ratio, a stock index basis, and an inflation series. The first real exchange\nrate series is the annual dollar-sterling (quk,a) analyzed in Lothian and Taylor (1996). The series\nis extended by using data for the U.S. and U.K. consumer price indices and the dollar-sterling\n12\nnominal exchange rate obtained from the International Financial Statistics (IFS) database. The ex-\ntended data set covers the period from 1791 to 2005. The remaining four are monthly rates for the\nU.S.-U.K. (quk), U.S.-Japan (qjp), U.S.-Canada (qcan) and U.S.-France (qfr) country pairs, that cover\nthe period January 1973 to December 2005. The series were constructed by using consumer price\nindices and nominal exchange rates from the IFS database. We employ the daily spot and futures\nprices of the FTSE 100 for the period January 1st 1988 to December 31st 1998 to construct the\nlog FTSE 100 basis (bftse) as analysed in Sarno and Monoyios (2002). The next two series are the\nquarterly U.K. log house price-income ratio (hp \u2212 y) and the monthly Nasdaq log dividend-price\nratio (d \u2212 p). Data for the former variable span the period 1983 to 2008 and are obtained from\nNationwide and the IFS. Price and dividend data cover the period 1973 to 2008 and were down-\nloaded from Datastream. The final series is the monthly inflation rate for Brazil (\u03c0), which covers\nthe period January 1957 to December 1990. The series is analyzed in Byers and Peel (2000) and\nBaillie et al. (1996) and can be downloaded from http:\/\/qed.econ.queensu.ca\/jae\/.\nIn order to assess the significance of nonlinearities in all series but inflation we first fit nonlinear\nESTAR models of the form proposed by Kilian and Taylor (2003):\nyt = \u03be0 +\np\u2211\ni=1\n\u03bei(yt\u2212i \u2212 \u03be0) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u03b8\nvar(yt\u22121)\n(yt\u22121 \u2212 \u03be0)\n2\n)\n+ \u03b7t, (6)\nwhere \u03bei with i = 1, . . . , p are parameters, p denotes the lag order, and\n\u2211p\ni=1 \u03be = 1.\n11 The above\nparameterization is very appealing for modeling deviations from parity and equilibrium conditions.\nUnlike in a linear model, the process moves between a white noise and a unit root depending on\nthe size of the deviation, |yt\u22121 \u2212 \u03be0| and the speed of adjustment \u03b8. Intuitively, small deviations\nthat do not cover transactions costs or the sunk costs of international arbitrage are left uncorrected\nand the process exhibits unit root behavior. On the other hand, large deviations are much less\npersistent. Given the size of the deviation, the speed of mean reversion increases with \u03b8. As far as\n11The lag order p is determined on the basis of the Akaike Information Criterion.\n13\nthe inflation for Brazil is concerned, we employ the estimates provided by Byers and Peel (2000).12\nThese estimates indicate that the process moves between multiple equilibria, one of which is high\nand one low inflation.\nTable 3\nThe second column of Table 3 shows the estimated \u03b8 coefficients. The estimates vary con-\nsiderably across applications. Moreover, all coefficients are statistically significant at least at the\n10 per cent significance level implying that the series are nonlinear and globally stationary. The\nmaximum \u03b8 estimate is about 0.058 and corresponds to the annual dollar-sterling real exchange\nrate data. While, the minimum is about 0.004, which lies outside the range examined by KSS but\nincluded in the previous section, for the real exchange rate of Canada.\nThese results have the following economic implications. Regarding real exchange rates, they\nsuggest that prices and exchange rates are related with the adjustment mechanism being nonlin-\near. Moreover, they are in line with other studies which utilize nonlinear models and explain the\ndocumented difficulty of unit root tests typically employed in the 1980s to reject the null hypoth-\nesis (Michael et al., 1997). Turning to the dividend-price ratio, the fact that \u03b8 is significant for the\nNasdaq index complements the analysis of Gallagher and Taylor (2001) and rules out the presence\nof bubbles (the dot-com bubble) suggested by other studies. A similar conclusion can be drawn\nfrom the estimate of the speed of adjustment for the house price-income ratio of the U.K. housing\nmarket. The fact that the FTSE futures basis is nonlinearly mean reverting is in accordance with\nSarno and Monoyios (2002) and stresses the importance of modeling stock market frictions.\nTurning to the results displayed in the remaining columns of Table 3, we observe that the\nunit root hypothesis cannot be rejected for all the monthly real exchange rates, the house price-\nincome ratio and the dividend-price ratio.13 On the other hand, the null is rejected for the annual\n12Note that the authors adopt a slightly different ESTAR parameterization that the one of Kilian and Taylor (2003)\nallowing for the sum of the autoregressive coefficients to be different from unity.\n13There are two exceptions, quk in the KSS constant case and d\u2212 p in the KSS constant and trend case.\n14\ndollar-sterling real exchange rate and the FTSE 100 basis for the constant and constant and trend\ncases. These two series have the highest estimated \u03b8 values. The fact that the number of rejections\nis substantially lower than the number of statistically significant \u03b8 coefficients raises concerns\nregarding the power of the tests which is consistent with the results of the previous section.\nA particularly interesting case is the inflation rate series presented in the last row of the table.\nAs mentioned above, Byers and Peel (2000) show that this process exhibits multiple equilibria, one\nwith low inflation rate and one with high. The country appears to be in its low steady state until\nthe mid-1980s (mean monthly inflation before 1986 was 3.6 per cent) and then to move slowly\ninto the high state (the mean inflation for the period 1986 to 1990 was 17.3). The change from\none equilibrium to the other has clearly severe consequences for unit root tests. The ADF which\ncannot account for multiple equilibria suggests that the series is explosive for the no constant and\nconstant cases.14 This has important economic implications since, via PPP, the Brazilian nominal\nexchange rate should also be explosive. Moreover, asset returns should exhibit a similar behavior.\nThe results for the tNL and EG statistics, although do not imply an explosive behavior, still indicate\nthat non stationarity cannot be rejected.\nOverall, rejections of the null hypothesis for all tests appear to be related with the magnitude\nof the \u03b8 coefficient, the sample size and the existence of multiple equilibria. These results seem to\nbe in line with the simulation experiments.\n5 Conclusions\nOver the last decades there has been a steadily increasing interest in the development and applica-\ntion of nonlinear time series models. In this study we focus on the widely used family of smooth\ntransition autoregressive models, which appear to parsimoniously capture the nonlinear depen-\ndence of many economic and financial time series. Specifically, we illustrate the flexibility of the\n14The critical values for the explosive alternative can be found in Fuller (1996).\n15\nESTAR model to encompass a number of different characteristics found in empirical work and\nsuggested by the theoretical literature using market frictions and heterogeneous agents. These are\nmultiple equilibria, complex dynamics, chaotic-like behavior, and spurious trends.\nIn turn, we examine the properties of a recently proposed unit root test against smooth transition\nstationary processes when there are no priors regarding the deterministic components and possible\nmultiple equilibria. We also make comparison with two alternative unit root tests widely employed\nin the literature. Our results stress that the power of the tests is highly dependent on the properties\nof the series. Moreover, no test dominates the others.\nFinally, we run several applications on the foreign exchange, stock and housing markets as well\nas a hyper-inflation series. Despite the fact that we can successfully fit nonlinear models implying\na stable nonlinear adjustment mechanism which supports arbitrage conditions as well as globally\nstationary multiple equilibria inflation series, unit root tests fail, in general, to detect the mean\nreversion.\nOverall, our findings suggest that the difficulty to reject the unit root property in many financial\nand macroeconomic data on the basis of unit root testing should not be regarded as conclusive\nevidence. In particular, the factors examined here can severely contaminate the power of both\nlinear and nonlinear unit root tests.\n16\nReferences\nBaillie, Richard T., Ching-Fan Chung, and Margie A.
