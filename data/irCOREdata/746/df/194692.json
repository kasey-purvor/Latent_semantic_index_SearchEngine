It was determined that all the\navailable hydroxyl groups on cellulose had been modified.\nIntroduction\nThe cationic functionalisation of cellulose is of considerable\nindustrial importance and has found applications in the paper\nindustry, cosmetics, textiles, in flotation and flocculation and in\ndrilling fluids.1 In particular, it is used in the removal of acidic dyes\nfrom aqueous effluent produced by the textile industry, which\nsignificantly reduces the environmental impact of such processes.2\nThese dyes are of an anionic nature comprising of groups such as\nsulfonates, carboxylates or sulfates, and so suit the use of a cationic\nsubstrate.3 The form of cellulose often used, cotton, is natural,\ninexpensive and renewable.3\nThe preferred route to the formation of these materials is by\nthe etherification of cellulose using glycidyl ammonium salts or\nalkylene epoxides in the presence of a suitable alkaline catalyst,\nusually sodium hydroxide. Cationic substitution values between\n0.034 and 0.5 moles of quaternary nitrogen per mole of glucose\nunit have been reported.4\u20136 However, such approaches entail the\nuse of large amounts of organic solvents, and result in low yields\nand the loss of product as a result of solubility in the reaction\nmixture.1 Two other approaches, coupling oligo-ionomers to\ncellulose fibres and grafting on cationic polymer chains, have also\nbeen reported, but again yields tend to be poor.7\nWe have previously reported the development of ionic liquids\nbased on a combination of the inexpensive and readily available\ncomponents choline chloride (ChCl; HOCH2CH2N(Me)3Cl) and\nzinc chloride as alternatives to the more commonly employed\nalkyl imidazolium\u2013aluminium chloride mixtures.8 These new\nLewis acidic solvents have been successfully employed for a\nvariety of reactions.9\u201311 We have also reported a eutectic mixture\nof choline chloride and urea which forms an ionic liquid analogue\nwith the advantage of being non-toxic and readily biodegradable\nbut has no Lewis acidity.12 Two uses of this mixture for inorganic\napplications have recently been reported.13,14 In this current study\nwe report the first successful use for organic synthetic processes\nof a deep eutectic solvent, consisting of a choline derivative and\nurea, which can be employed as both a reagent and solvent for the\ncationic functionalisation of cellulose.\nResults and discussion\nCellulose, in the form of cotton wool, was quaternised using\nsodium hydroxide and a chlorcholine chloride-based (ClChCl;\nClCH2CH2N(Me)3Cl) deep eutectic solvent, for 15 h at 90 uC\n(Scheme 1).{ The modified cotton wool was removed from the\nsolvent and copiously washed with water to give the product. A\nvariety of methods for determining the degree of cationic\nfunctionalisation of cellulose substituted by conventional means\nhave been reported. Kjeldahl analysis accurately determines the\nnitrogen content and thus the degree of cationic substitution,1\nalthough other approaches such as solid-state NMR,15 elemental\nanalysis16 and dye adsorption17 have been reported. Analysis of\nthe product by the Kjeldahl method gave a cationic substitution\nvalue of 0.5% of quaternary nitrogen per mole of glucose unit.\nCationic functionalisation was also confirmed by the use of a\ncationic dye, methylene blue. A calibration plot was constructed by\nusing different concentrations of methylene blue and this was used\nto measure the dye concentration in the supernatant liquid\nresulting from placing 0.05 g of substituted cotton wool in 3 ml of\ndye solution for 3 hours (see ESI{). This was repeated with\nunmodified cotton wool and the concentration of dye repelled due\nto the functionalisation was determined to be 1.44 6 1028 moles.\nThe above analysis assumes that all the quaternised groups\nbecome attached to the cellulose by reaction of the chlorcholine\nchloride with the available OH groups, and that no physisorption\nonto the cotton wool is occurring. The extent to which\nphysisorption could be occurring was examined by repeating the\nreaction without the use of sodium hydroxide, thus preventing the\nchemical reaction from occurring. Dye analysis of the product\nshowed that 8.25 6 1029 moles of dye were repelled, thus\nconfirming the presence of functionalised material.

This showed that cellulose containing only\nphysisorbed material progressively loses all its quaternised material\nwhereas the cellulose containing both chemi- and physisorbed\nmaterial loses around 50%.\nChemisorbed material therefore accounts for around half of the\nquaternised product. As the cotton wool was washed thoroughly\nin the work-up procedure the material removed over the period of\n72 hours can be assumed to be genuinely physisorbed rather than\nthat merely trapped between the cotton wool fibres.\nSecondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) showed peaks\nrelating to both chemisorbed and physisorbed material. Taking\ninto account the extent of physisorption, the degree of cationic\nsubstitution based only on chemisorbed material was estimated to\nbe 0.22%.\nThe degree of cationic substitution reported is based on the\nassumption that all of the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose fibres\nare available for functionalisation to take place. However, only\nthe hydroxyl groups on the surface of the fibres are likely to be\naccessible for substitution. The ratio of the surface groups to those\nin the bulk of the monomer was estimated using the following\nequation.{\nRatio~\np rz2R\u00f0 \u00de2{pr2\np rz2R\u00f0 \u00de2\nWhere r is the radius of the cellulose fibre and R is the radius of\nthe glucose monomer on the surface of the fibre. The radius of the\ncellulose fibre (1 6 1025 m) was determined by the use of atomic\nforce microscopy, and the radius of a glucose monomer (7.95 6\n10210 m) by a molecular modelling package.18 The resulting ratio\nwas found to be 3.18 6 1024, or 0.0318% of available glucose\nmonomers and hence the available hydroxyl groups present. This\nfigure lies just outside the range of the cationic substitution\ndetermined by Kjeldahl analysis. However, the estimation of the\navailable groups on the surface was based on the assumption that\nno wetting (opening up) of the cellulose fibres takes place.\nFig. 2 shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of\ncotton wool before and after being subjected to the deep eutectic\nsolvent. These show that the cotton wool is slightly wetted upon\ncontact with the eutectic solvent presumably resulting in more\nhydroxyl groups being available for reaction. Taking this into\naccount it is reasonable to assume that the vast majority, if not all,\nof the available hydroxyl groups on the cellulose have been\nfunctionalised.\nThe cationic functionalisation of the surface leads to a material\nwith increased hydrophilicity. Thermogravimmetry showed that\nthe sample was able to absorb an additional 26 wt% of water\ncompared to unmodified cellulose.\nThe effect of different reaction times (Table 1, entries 1\u20133) and\ntemperatures (entries 2, 4 and 5) were investigated to discover the\noptimum conditions for the reaction. The cationic substitution\nvalues were calculated using the dye method and are based only on\nchemisorbed material assuming, as previously, that around 50% of\nthe material was due to physisorption.\nFrom this it was concluded that 15 hours at 90 uC were the most\nfavourable conditions for the cationic functionalisation of cellulose\nin the deep eutectic solvent, ClChCl(urea)2.\nWhile cellulose derivatised with cationic functionalities repels\ncationic dyes it is very effective at adsorbing anionic dyes, which\nare the main branch of water soluble dyes used in printing. The\nefficacy of using cationic functionalised cellulose for dye adsorp-\ntion was determined using orange II. It was found that the\nmodified cellulose produced in entry 2 of Table 1 was capable of\nextracting 0.06 wt% orange II dye, which suggests that these\nmaterials may be suitable alternatives for cleaning dyes from\naqueous waste streams.\nFig. 1 Comparison of derivatised cellulose produced with and without\nthe use of NaOH.\nFig. 2 SEM images of cotton wool (left) and cotton wool after contact\nwith eutectic solvent for 15 hours at 90 uC.\nTable 1 Determination of the optimum conditions for the cationic\nfunctionalisation of cellulose in a deep eutectic solvent\nEntry Time\/h Temperature\/uC Cationic substitution (%)\n1 3 90 0.09\n2 15 90 0.22\n3 60 90 0.19\n4 15 60 0.06\n5 15 120 0.19\nThis journal is \u0001 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2006 Green Chem., 2006, 8, 784\u2013786 | 785\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n o\nn \n04\n Ju\nly\n 2\n00\n6.\n D\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n U\nni\nve\nrs\nity\n o\nf L\nei\nce\nste\nr o\nn \n19\n\/0\n8\/\n20\n13\n 1\n5:\n43\n:5\n5.\n \nView Article Online\nConclusion\nThis work has shown that an ionic liquid analogue based on\nClChCl and urea acts as both reagent and solvent in the effective\ncationic functionalisation of cellulose. It was determined that all\nthe avaliable hydroxyl groups on cellulose had been modified and\nthat this material is significantly more hydrophilic than cellulose.\nWe have demonstrated the potential to produce a material with a\ngreen application from renewable sources using a green synthetic\nmethodology.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge EPSRC, Crystal\nFaraday and Procter and Gamble for funding this work.\nNotes and references\n1 R.
