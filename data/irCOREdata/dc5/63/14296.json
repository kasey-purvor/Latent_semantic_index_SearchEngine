This builds on existing\nframeworks for designing courses involving C&IT. A hypothetical illustration of this\nprocess is provided, and issues relating to the adoption and application of the\nmethodology are identified.\nIntroduction\nA wide variety of communication and information technologies (C&IT) is now available,\noffering education a broad range of potential benefits, be they educational (Mapp, 1994;\nLewis and Merton, 1996; HEFCE, 1997a), economic (HEFCE, 1997a), or in terms of\ncompetitiveness with other universities in an increasingly global market (Maier et al, 1997).\nThe uptake and use of these resources is patchy at best (Laurillard et al, 1993; Lewis and\nMerton, 1996). This mismatch between potential and use has been seen as increasingly\nimportant, and incentives and recommendations are leading to an increasing use of C&IT,\nas illustrated by the recommendations of the recent Dealing report (Dearing et al, 1997)\nand the priorities of the TLT programme (HEFCE, 1997b). Concerns have been voiced,\nhowever, that the push towards a wider embedding of C&IT in education may ignore issues\nof the appropriate uses of these resources. What is needed is a convincing and practical\npedagogically-driven (as opposed to technology-driven) methodology for integrating\nC&IT into courses.\nThis paper seeks to address this issue by proposing a pedagogically sound methodology for\nintegrating C&IT into courses. It reviews recent frameworks for course design, discusses\nthe findings of a pilot study that seeks to inform this process, and presents a methodology\nwhich incorporates the following:\n\u2022 the definition of a learning scenario, in terms of the stages of learning;\n\u2022 the mapping of learning scenarios to the types of media best suited to supporting them;\n4\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\n\u2022 the specification of related resource requirements.\nThe resultant methodology forms a five-stage process whose emphasis is on providing\npractical support for practitioners who aim to embed C&IT into their courses. This\nsupport includes tools for weighing the educational and economic advantages of C&IT ,\nguidelines for embedding materials in an integrated fashion, and a means of specifying the\nsupporting resources the enhanced course will require.\nThe methodology aims to be neutral with respect to educational philosophies, attempting\nto avoid commitment to constructivism (e.g. Grabinger et al, 1997), Fordism (e.g.\nMcAleese et al, 1997), and so on, leaving the choice of position to the practitioners who\nuse the model. It does, however, draw on Laurillard's conversational framework (1993) as a\nmodel for educational interactions.\nExisting frameworks for embedding C&IT\nA variety of frameworks already exist which can be used to design courses incorporating\nC&IT . In this section, three examples of these will be briefly reviewed. These represent\nthree distinct approaches to the process, and so provide a useful overview of the range of\nissues associated with embedding C&IT. (A more detailed discussion of these approaches,\nand their relationship with the framework proposed in this paper, can be found in Conole\nand Oliver, 1997.) Finally, the complementary elements of these are drawn together in\norder .to create a new framework.\nThe Open Learning Foundation framework\nWork by the Open Learning Foundation has led to the definition of a framework for\nimplementing C&IT (Mapp, 1994) which consists of four interrelated elements: institu-\ntional infrastructure, the learning environment, human and institutional relationships, and\nthe learning materials. It should be noted that the framework is intended to form the focus\nof discussion of C&IT-related issues, and not a procedure by which this is achieved.\nA methodology for integrated learning environment design\nA more structured procedure for designing integrated learning environments, which shares\nmany themes with the Open Learning Foundation framework, has been proposed by Lewis\nand Merton (1996). This takes students' needs and learning styles as the starting point of the\nprocess of embedding C&IT into the curriculum, expanding on this using the following steps:\n\u2022 identification of students' learning needs;\n\u2022 identification of student access needs skill requirements;\n\u2022 consideration of the organization and presentation of the curriculum, including:\n- learning outcomes,\n- learning methods,\n- sequence of methods and media,\n- assessment methods,\n- learning hours,\n- access.\ns\nGrainne Corio\/e and Martin Oliver A pedagogical framework for embedding C&IT into the curriculum\nThis methodology adopts a much clearer focus on individual courses than that of the Open\nLearning Foundation, through its emphasis on learning. The specification of objectives\nand methods is not intended to be prescriptive. The methodology centres around a series of\nquestions, aimed at practitioners, which are intended to promote reflection on key issues of\nC&IT use in relation to student learning. These questions include:\n\u2022 What are the students trying to achieve?\n\u2022 What are the best ways of achieving these outcomes?\n\u2022 What different routes are available to students pursuing these outcomes?\nThe application of learning technology to curriculum design\nA third approach to integrating C&IT is provided by Harrison (1994), whose framework\nconcentrates on curriculum design and delivery. For this reason, practitioners become\ncentral to the process, providing expertise on course-related issues such as student needs\nand assessment methods. Harrison proposes that the following steps form the planning\nprocess for the new style of flexible learning:\n\u2022 clarify the course's aims and learning outcomes;\n\u2022 consider whether to write, buy or adopt supporting materials;\n\u2022 consider whether course content can be based on existing materials, or needs to be\ndeveloped for this particular course;\n\u2022 establish a course overview;\n\u2022 decide on the academic level of the course (Is it introductory? Are any other courses\nprerequisites?);\n\u2022 select appropriate assessment models (Multiple-choice or open assignments? Student,\ntutor or computer marked?).\nAn important factor external to this process is the role of formative evaluations of the\nrevised course, creating an ongoing series of improvement.\nA combined framework for embedding C&IT\nThere are several similarities between the three approaches described above. All, for\nexample, stress the relationship between tutor and student. Moreover, none of the\nadditional criteria proposed seems to contradict those of the other frameworks. For this\nreason, it is proposed that these could be unified to provide a single, coherent and inclusive\nframework, intended for use by practitioners wanting to embed C&IT into their courses. It\nwould be structured to include the following steps:\n\u2022 establish current course overview;\n\u2022 clarify the course's aims and learning outcomes;\n\u2022 establish the methods, work and activities ('learning scenarios') required to achieve the\naims and outcomes;\n\u2022 identify the organization and presentation of the activities, identifying the method best\nsuited to building on existing knowledge and capabilities of the students, considering\nappropriateness of the learning media, and the flexibility of sequencing;\n6\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\n\u2022 for each activity, consider whether to write, buy or adopt supporting materials;\n\u2022 select appropriate assessment models;\n\u2022 link the individual learning scenarios to form a unified course;\n\u2022 identify student access needs and skill requirements;\n\u2022 establish resource requirements, and infrastructure requirements (e.g. a need for staff\ntraining) where appropriate.\nIn addition to drawing together the three approaches outlined above, this framework adds\ntwo new elements. The first is the focus of analysis being shifted to 'learning scenarios',\nrather than courses. This term is intended to describe any educational interaction (e.g. a\nlecture, a discussion, a group project), and will be defined in more detail in the following\nsection. Analysis at this level is argued to be more appropriate than analysis at a course-\nwide level, since resources relevant to one activity may not be well suited to another.\nCourse-wide C&IT use is then considered when the learning scenarios are reintegrated,\nwhen the focus is on unifying individual components. The second element which has been\nintroduced is the analysis of course composition in terms of its aims and outcomes. A\nfocus on embedding C&IT often neglects the fact that existing courses may be less than\nideal, and could be improved by altering the range of activities they involve.\nDefinition and characteristics of a learning scenario\nIn the previous section, it was proposed that the embedding C&IT into the curriculum\nmost effectively required an analysis of courses at the level of educational activities, which\nwere referred to as 'learning scenarios'. This catch-all term has been introduced in order to\navoid pre-conceived ideas of what constitutes learning and teaching, leaving these\ndecisions to the practitioners using the framework.\nLearning scenarios are defined to include several characteristics, including:\n\u2022 media type;\n\u2022 use of media;\n\u2022 the preparatory work required;\n\u2022 the educational interactions which are supported;\n\u2022 the delivery constraints.\nMedia type is used in the sense proposed by Laurillard (1993). The use of media is simply a\nspecification of the way in which the chosen media type is to be used. Consideration of\nthese will determine the last three qualities: preparatory work required, educational inter-\nactions, and delivery constraints. One example of a learning scenario would be a lecture,\ndrawing on the tutor's own notes, introducing algebra to a group of students. Another\nwould be a group project by geographically remote students involving Web-based dis-\ncussion and research, leading to a report on public attitudes to science. The concept of\nlearning scenarios allows this diversity of educational activities to be referred to with one\ncommon term, and, more importantly, identifies a set of qualities which allow these\nactivities to be compared.\n7\nGrainne donate and Martin Oliver A pedagogical framework for embedding C&IT into the curriculum\nThe remainder of this section explores the qualities of learning scenarios in greater depth.\nMedia type and use\nThe media types proposed by Laurillard (1993) form a useful and fairly comprehensive\nreview of resources and activities that can be used to support the process of teaching and\nlearning. For convenience, traditional teaching methods such as seminars, lectures and\ntutorials will also be referred to as 'media types', simply because they also provide support\nfor educational interactions.\nAt least as important as the type of media adopted is the use it is put to. Using a simulation\nto teach laboratory skills is clearly a very different activity from using the same simulation\nas the starting point for a debate on software design, which has obvious implications for\nthe educational interactions supported.\nPreparatory work\nThe process of preparing for an educational interaction will vary between different\nlearning scenarios. Some, such as student-led seminars, require comparatively little\npreparation on the part of the tutor; in contrast, a multimedia CD-ROM developed in-\nhouse would require extensive preparation from a team of tutors and software developers.\nThese issues have considerable impact in terms of the cost-effectiveness of C&IT use, since\npre-prepared materials will require far less staff time than developing new resources\n(Harrison, 1994).\nTo provide some comparison between the associated costs of adopting, revising and\ndeveloping different types of media, a comparison table was piloted with focus-group\nsoftware developers and educational technologists. The resulting comparisons between\nmedia, covering staff time and resources required to support the preparations, are gathered\ntogether in Table 1. The table has been arranged with technology-based media preceding\ntraditional forms of teaching.\nIt should be noted that the figures and resources are based on 'best-guesses' of experts,\nrather than surveys of staff use, and so should be seen as indicative rather than definitive.\nThe table is intended to be used as a tool by practitioners transforming courses; it would be\nfor them to estimate associated time and resource implications, using informed examples\nwhere necessary, in order to arrive at a comparison between the media types available to\nthem.\nEducational interactions\nWhile the information given in Table 1 allows a comparison of media types in terms of the\nassociated preparatory work and associated requirements, it fails to detail the range of\neducational interactions that can be supported. Instead, these have been modelled using\nLaurillard's conversational framework (Laurillard, 1993), shown in Figure 1.\nThis framework has already been used to identify the educational interactions which\northodox uses of teaching media support (Laurillard, 1993). The 12 educational\ninteractions it describes have been used as the basis of an educational comparison between\nuses of media. However, it is suggested that the original system of classification, while\nuseful, lacks the detail required for a pragmatic comparison of media types. Moreover, by\nconcentrating on 'orthodox' uses, it neglects individual differences in practitioners' styles.\nFor these reasons, the classification system has been altered from a Yes\/No response to a\n8\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 2\nMedia type\nAsynchronous bulletin board\nAudio-vision\nAudio-cassette\nBroadcast TV\nEmail\nFill in the gaps\nHypertext\nMicroworlds\nMultimedia\nRadio\nSAQs\nSimulations\nSynchronous audio\nconferencing\nSynchronous chat systems\nSynchronous, video\nconferencing\nTutorial Program\nTutorial Simulation\nTutorial System\nVideo-cassette\nWhiteboards\nFieldtrips\nFormal exam\nLecture\nPracticals\nPrint (handouts or workbooks)\nProgress tests\nSeminar\nTutorial - S\/S\nTutorial-T\/S\nExamples of organizing the structure\nSet up forums and write activities\nPrepare script and record, write handout\nPrepare script and record\nPrepare script and record\nDefine use\nDesign and word process fill in the gaps\nProduce HTML documents and gift\nAuthor microworld or provide\naccompanying explanations\nAuthor material and record clips\nPrepare script and record\nAuthor questions\nAuthor simulation or set the scene for\nthe exercise\nSet the scene\nWrite instructions and define use\nSet the scene or prepare \"lecture\"\nAuthor program or provide instructions\nAuthor program or provide instructions\nAuthor program or provide instructions\nPrepare script and record\nPrepare instructions for use\nPrepare activities, arrange bookings\nWord Process, Exam boards\nOrganize notes, write OHPs or\nslide presentations\nDesign and test experiments.\nWrite manual, Order materials\nWord process material\nWord process\nSet seminar topic\nSetting the scene for student-led tutorial\nPrepare tutorial sheet\nNew(hours)\n2-5\n50-200\n20-100\n50-500\n0-1\n5-20\n2-10\n5-200\n100-200\n20-100\n5-20\n5-100\n2-3\n0-1\n2-5\n20-100\n75-300\n50-200\n50-200\n1-2\n5-20\n10-15\n2-5\n10-20\n5-20\n2-5\n0-3\n0-1\n2-5\nExisting(hours)\n0\n5-20\n2-10\n5-20\n0\n1-5\n5-20\n5-20\n5-20\naudio)\n2-10-\n2-5\n5-20\n0\n0\n0\n5-20\n5-20\n5-20\n5-20\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1-5\n0\n0\n0\n0\nResources required\nBB Software\nRecording equipment script\nRecording equipment script\nRecording equipment scnpt\nEmail software\n-\nHTML editor browser\nMMPC microworld software,\nauthoring software\nMMPC Multimedia software(authoring, graphics, and\nBroadcasting equipment script\nAssessment software\nMMPC, simulation software,\nauthoring software\nBroadcasting and reception\nequipment and\/or software\nChat software\nBroadcasting and reception\nequipment and\/or software\nMMPC tutoring software,\nauthoring software\nMMPC, tutoring software,\nauthoring software\nMMPC tutoring software,\nauthoring software\nRecording equipment script\nWhiteboard software\nTransport location,\naccommodation\n-\nOverheads, presentation\nsoftware\nLab, equipment materials\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTable I: Preparatory work comparison chart\ngrading.

This ensures that the system accurately reflects\nindividuals' teaching styles, and avoids being prescriptive.

A balance between uses of computer-\nbased and traditional media can also help shift the emphasis of contact time with tutor\nand staff. Resources such as CAL or hypertext could be used in place of lectures, where the\nemphasis is on exposition of information, freeing staff time for discussion-based meetings\nof small groups (cf. Lewis and Merton, 1996). Use of appropriate technologies, for\nexample videoconferencing or synchronous conferencing systems, would allow these\nbenefits to be extended to distance learners (Harrison, 1994).\nThat the results shown in Tables 2 and 3 have highlighted both the issue and a potential\nsolution suggests that requiring practitioners to work through these as part of the process\nof embedding C&IT is a useful and practical exercise.\nDelivery constraints\nThe final characteristic of learning scenarios is the set of delivery constraints with which\nthey are associated. These include restrictions on time and location for the delivery and\naccessing of information, and may involve specific hardware, software, personnel or\nenvironmental requirements. These will often dictate the spaces and facilities required to\nsupport the learning scenario. These constraints are presented for traditional and\ncomputer-based media in Tables 4 and 5. As with the other tables in this report, this\ninformation is intended to be illustrative rather than prescriptive.\nThe codes used in the student location column indicate different types of venue. Five\nabbreviations are used:\nOpen Access Machines (OAM), for individual access, housed in computer rooms.\nLibrary Centre (LC), providing open access machines and areas for individual study.\nGroup Work Computers (GWC), housed in a room designated for use by classes or large\ngroups of students, and supporting face-to-face discussion as well as on-line\ncommunication.\nLecture Room (LR).\nSeminar Room (SR).\nThese five types of provision should cover the majority of modes of delivery used by\nuniversities.\nLinking learning scenarios to form integrated courses\nHaving defined and explored the qualities of learning scenarios, what remains is to link the\nindividual activities to form an integrated course. This involves sequencing and linking the\nscenarios, and integrating these with the role of the teacher (Harrison, 1994). Additionally,\na coherent front-end needs to be provided for students, and integrated support for course\nadministration needs to be supported. These will ensure the smooth dissemination of\ninformation and course-related announcements between the faculty and students.\nA number of media types can be used to support these requirements, including paper-\nbased post, Web-based timetables, email distribution lists, and so on. Whichever media\ntype is chosen, it should be able to support as many of the required functions as possible.\nRequiring students to access a variety of media in order to find the information they\nrequire will present a far less cohesive appearance to the course.\n12\nALT-} Volume 6 Number 2\nMedia type\nLecture\nPrint\nFill-the-gaps\nworkbooks\nRadio\nAudio-Cassette\nAudio-Visual\nBroadcast TV\nVideo Cassette\nTutorial (T\/S)\nTutorial (S\/S)\nSeminar\nfield trip\nPractical\nProgress tests\nFormal exams\nTime\ndependent\nTutor\n\u2022\nX\nX\n\/\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u2022\nX\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nStudent\n\u2022\nX\nX\n\u2022\nX\nX\n\u2022\nX\n\u2022\n\/\n\/\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nLocation\ndependent\nTutor\n\/\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\/\nX\n\/\n\/\n\/\n\/\n\/\nStudent\n\u2022\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\/\n\/\n\u2022\n\/\n\/\nUsually\ninvolves a\nco-present\ngroup\n\u2022\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nUsually\ninvolves\ngroup\nwork\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nSometimes\nSometimes\nX\nX\nRequirements\nPresentation equipment\n(e.g. OHP, whiteboard,\nPowerPoint etc)\nBook\/handout\nWorkbook\nLocation\nof student\nLR\nLC\nLC\nBroadcast & reception equipment LC\nCassette player\nCassette player & workbook\nLC\nLC\nBroadcast & reception equipment LC\nRecording & viewing equipment LC\nRoom, tutorial staff\nRoom\nRoom\nLocation, accommodation\nLab, manual, technician staff\nRoom, test\nRoom, exam\nSR\nSR\nSR\nExternal\nLab\nSRorLR\nHall\nTable 4: Delivery constraints comparison chart traditional media\nThis unification of administrative support also provides opportunities to build a sense of a\nlearning community amongst the students, enhancing the atmosphere of the course.

This analysis can be used as the basis for a methodology which\nallows courses to be enhanced through the embedding of C&IT resources in a\npedagogically sound way.\nThis methodology involves a step-by-step analysis of requirements, starting from existing\ncourses, leading to the identification of computer-based resources capable of enhancing\nlearning, a specification of the type of venues capable of supporting this kind of learning,\nand a procedure for linking these scenarios together to form a new, cohesive and unified\ncourse. Central to this process is the tutor's knowledge and understanding of the course\n(Harrison, 1994). For this reason, the methodology is intended to be used by practitioners,\nallowing them to identify and compare alternatives to the learning scenarios currently in\nuse.\nThis methodology involves the following stages:\n\u2022 A review of current course structure, identifying the existing learning situations.\n\u2022 An examination of the current course structure to establish areas of learning which\ncould be enhanced.\n13\nGrainne Conole and Martin Oliver A pedagogical framework for embedding C&IT into the curriculum\nMedia type Time\ndependent\nLocation\ndependent\nUsually Usually\ninvolves a involves\nco-present\ngroup\nRequirements\ngroup\nwork\nLocation\nof student\nTutor Student Tutor Student\nLecture\nHypertext\nMultimedia\nCAL\nTutoring systems\n\u2022\nX\nX\nX\nX\nTutorial simulations X\nSimulations\nMicroworlds\nEmail\nChat system\nAsynchronous\nbulletin board\nSync, audio\nconference\nSync, video\nconference\nWhiteboard\nSAQs\nX\nX\nX\n\u2022\nX\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nX\n\u2022\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\u2022\nX\n\/\n\u2022\n\/\nX\n\u2022\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\/\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\/\nX\nSometimes\nSometimes\nX\nX\nSometimes\nSometimes\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSometimes\nX\nX\nX\nX\nSometimes\nSometimes\nX\nX\nSometimes\nSometimes\n\/\n\/\n\/\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\/\nX\nPresentation equipment\nWeb, PC\nMMPC\nPC\nPC\nMMPC\nPC\nPC equipment\nPC, Email\nWeb\nWeb\nWeb\nWeb&Video\nWeb & software\nWeb or PC\nLR\nLC.OAM\nLCOAMorGWC\nLCOAMorGWC\nLCOAM\nOAM\nOAMorGWC\nOAMorGWC\nLCOAM\nLCOAM\nLC.OAM\nAudio conf. suite\nVideo conf. suite\nOAM\nLCOAM orGWC\nTable 5: Delivery constraints comparison chart computer-based media\n\u2022 Working through the media comparison tables to establish possible replacements or\nadditions to the learning situations in the course.

Rather than being prescriptive, it seeks to highlight issues for the tutor to consider,\nand provide tools which can be used to address them. An example of the application of\nthis methodology to a course can be found in Conole and Oliver (1997).\nConclusions\nThis paper has outlined a methodology for embedding C&IT into courses in a\npedagogically sound way. The methodology extends approaches currently put forward for\nembedding C&IT by providing a framework of issues which will influence the choice of\nresource and the way in which it is used. This is based on an analysis of courses in terms of\n14\nALT-} Volume 6 Number 2\nthe learning scenarios they consist of. An example of how this process can be applied is\npresented to illustrate this process.\nWhilst this report has focused on integrating C&IT at a course level, there are a range of\npotential barriers to this process which can arise within institutions. Embedding C&IT\nrequires institutional and departmental commitment to make innovation the norm, rather\nthan an exception (Maier et al, 1997). To achieve this, it is likely that University-wide staff\ndevelopment will be needed. It is vital that staff be aware of and trained with new\ntechnologies if they are used effectively. Training in the use of the methodology outlined in\nthis report could be complemented by a broad programme of training with a variety of\nC&IT resources.\nWhilst this pedagogical framework is intended primarily as a focus for discussion, both in\nterms of staff involved in course transformation and research into this area, its timeliness\nin the light of the Dealing report and initiatives such as phase three of the TLT project\nsimply enhances its importance as a way of guiding the use of C&IT.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the following people at the University of North London for their\nhelpful comments on this paper: Ray Jones, Jan McEneany and David Riley.
