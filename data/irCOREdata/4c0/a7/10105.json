In the UK, the National \nInstitute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) \nhas required its mental health guideline develop\u00ad\nment groups to use a standard, one\u00adsize\u00adfits\u00adall \napproach to evidence pertaining to the various \ntreatments used for specific common mental disor\u00ad\nders. When judged by the narrow criterion of the \navailability of sufficient numbers of high\u00adquality \ndouble\u00adblind random allocation controlled trials \nand meta\u00adanalyses, it may be fair to conclude that \nthe evidence base for the most used treatments for \ndepression is weak. However, this kind of null ver\u00ad\ndict does not take us very far, either in knowledge \nor in the development of practice. In any case, the \nrestrictive definition of evidence\u00adbased medicine \nin the mental health field which underpins this \njudgement has some adverse consequences and \nneeds to be heavily qualified. \nFirst, there is a pervasive fallacy that a statement \nabout a \u2018strong\u2019 or a \u2018weak\u2019 evidence base is a state\u00ad\nment about the weakness of the treatment rather \nthan about the limitations of the research methods \nused in the evaluation of that treatment. This \nintro duces damaging confounds. They include the \nconsequences of equating a weak evidence\u00adbase \nwith a weak treatment, or a supposedly strong \none with a strong treatment. Weak research or \nflawed guidelines may acquire a status they do \nnot deserve. \nSecond, although there always may be excep\u00ad\ntions, the fundamental difficulties of most people \nwith depression do not resolve with brief inter\u00ad\nventions of whatever variety. The natural course \nof depression is often prolonged, relapsing or \nrecurrent (Surtees & Barkley, 1994). Although \npatients are significantly helped by any well\u00ad\ninformed and responsive professional intervention, \nincluding really good clinical management, the \nresistant core of any significant psychopathology \nis a fact of life. To provide a quality mental health \nservice requires care and support, and specific \ninterventions available when needed in long\u00adterm \npackages. The randomised controlled trial (RCT) \nresearch agenda has so far been unable to take this \nfact sufficiently into account.\nThird, by and large, the dysfunctions from which \npatients suffer are not confined to those that can be \ncalled a single diagnosis. Most patients not only \nmeet the criteria for several different symptom\u00ad\nbased diagnoses, but have to cope with many \nsub optimal functions of the personality (Westen \net al, 2004). They complain of doubt of love, of \npast and present difficulties in terms of personal \nachievement and work, as well as of existential \nPsychoanalytic and psychodynamic \ntherapies for depression: the evidence base \nDavid Taylor\nAbstract This article argues that the current approach to guideline development for the treatment of depression \nis not supported by the evidence: clearly depression is not a disease for which treatment efficacy is \nbest determined by short\u00adterm randomised controlled trials. As a result, important findings have been \nmarginalised. Different principles of evidence\u00adgathering are described. When a wider range of the \navailable evidence is critically considered the case for dynamic approaches to the treatment of depression \ncan be seen to be stronger than is often thought.

By being short\u00adterm, RCTs and brief treatment \ninterventions avoid difficulties of this sort, whereas \nmental health workers should not, and patients \ncannot, do so.\nThus, for these and other reasons it can be \nargued that the NICE emphasis on RCTs as \nthe gold standard in the research evaluation of \npsychological therapy outcome is as unfounded as \nits evidence base is weak.\nThe position seems to be that different theoretical \napproaches, such as the cognitive, the pharma\u00ad\ncological, the psychiatric, or the psychoanalytic, \nthe clinical or the \u2018scientistic\u2019, have very different \nideas about the principles that should underpin \nthe methodology of outcome research and of \nevidence\u00adbased guidelines. These are serious and \nimportant disagreements about what counts as \nquality in evidence and fact, and about the place \nof clinical knowledge in the discourse. These \ndifferent positions translate into the way questions \nabout efficacy and effectiveness are asked and \nthe way in which they are answered. They give \nrise to serious problems of incommensurability: \nwhen we ask questions about complex issues \nwe must of necessity choose one among several \napproaches to frame our questions and to provide \nthe concepts and terminologies we think are best \nsuited to define, collect, observe and interpret \nwhat we count as empirical data. Empirical data \nare, in truth, empirical only up to a point. Beyond \nthat point they are highly method\u00addependent. We \ncannot simply examine the facts obtained by one \nmethod with the concepts belonging to another. \nTo cap it all, the factors that determine which of \nthe above approaches is dominant involve deep\u00ad\nseated personal preferences that are hard waxed \nagainst discrepant findings or arguments.\nThis article is in three sections. The first outlines \nthe preliminaries necessary to provide a frame of \nreference for the review of evidence that follows. \nThis evidence base is often an inconclusive and \ncontradictory set of findings from treatment out\u00ad\ncome studies relevant to depression. Often it seems \nmore like a quagmire than firm ground. I focus \nhere on the evidence pertaining to psychoanalytic\/\npsychodynamic approaches. I hope that it will be \npossible to begin to see how, if we judge by lights \nother than those subscribing to the primacy of \nmethod, the evidence base for psychodynamic ap\u00ad\nproaches is not actually that weak. There is, in fact, \na web of evidence supporting their value. Indeed, \nbecause this extends into so many domains it has \nnot been possible to give more than a hint of the \nwide range of different types of evidence that have \na bearing on this issue. In the final section I discuss \nthis evaluation and suggest some conclusions.\nPreliminaries for a frame  \nof reference\nPrevalence, course and nature  \nof depression\nIn high\u00adincome countries, over the course of a \nyear about 6% of the adult population will suffer a \nmajor depressive disorder, and 6% will experience \ndysthymia, with the lifetime prevalence of the \ndisorder being about 17% (Weissman et al, 1991). In \nthe community, between 20 and 30% of untreated \ndepressed individuals will still be depressed a year \nlater (Sargeant et al, 1990). Put the other way round, \n70% of people with untreated depression will \nrecover without intervention in the course of a year. \nGenerally, the risk of further episodes over the 10 \nto 15 years after an index episode is more than 85% \n(Mueller et al, 1999). Of those who initially respond \nto medication, 30% will relapse within a year, rising \nto as many as 75% after 5 years (Hirschfeld, 1991). \nEach person with major depressive disorder will \nexperience on average four episodes during their \nlifetime. Each of these episodes will last an average \nof 20 weeks with ongoing symptoms and disability \nduring the periods of \u2018remission\u2019 (Judd, 1997; Judd \net al, 1997).\nAs these figures suggest, depression can be a \ncircumscribed, self\u00adlimiting condition for some \npeople, but a significant proportion will suffer a \npattern of remission and relapse (Surtees & Barkley, \n1994), and will show a tendency for a deteriorating \noutlook as time goes by (Paykel, 1994) (Box 1). Yet, \nthe majority of RCTs of psychological therapy and \npharmacotherapy involve short\u00adterm treatments \nof acute\u00adphase depression, with non\u00adexistent or \nbrief follow\u00adups. These studies therefore do not \nprovide reliable information about efficacy over \nBox 1 The natural course of depression\nFor about 50% of individuals, the duration of \u2022\u2022\nillness is 3 months; thereafter the probability \nof remission diminishes rapidly \n60% of people receiving antidepressant \u2022\u2022\nmedi cation still meet the criteria for major \ndepressive disorder after 1 year of treat\u00ad\nment, and 20% after 2 years\nUp to 90% of patients develop new episodes \u2022\u2022\nafter recovery \nOnly 20% of people hospitalised for \u2022\u2022\ndepression remained well over a 15\u00adyear \nfollow\u00adup\n(Lee & Murray, 1988; Coryell et al, 1994; \nGoldberg et al, 1998; Spijker et al, 2002) \nAdvances in Psychiatric Treatment (2008), vol. 14. http:\/\/apt.rcpsych.org\/ 403\nPsychotherapies for depression\nthe medium and longer term, especially in relation \nto those who have more chronic or severe forms of \ndepression.\nThe taxonomy of depression \nThe data above were arrived at using diagnostic \nschemes based on the idea that depression, general\u00ad\nised anxiety disorder and obsessive\u2013compulsive \ndisorder are distinct entities. If they truly were \nseparate entities, they would be expected to occur \nindependently of each other, to have their own \nparticular aetiology, and each would respond to \nits own specific treatment acting on pathological \nprocesses specific to the disorder. What we find \ndoes not support this idea (Box 2).\nThe psychoanalytic\/psychodynamic \nmodel of therapy\nThe term \u2018psychodynamic psychotherapy\u2019 encom\u00ad\npasses therapeutic approaches derived origin\u00ad\nally from psychoanalysis and depth psychology. \nAlthough psychodynamic psychotherapies are \nvarious, the role of early development, unconscious \nprocesses and the transference significance of \nthe therapeutic relationship are to some extent \ncommon to most. \n In classical psychoanalysis the analyst seeks \nto follow the patient rather than to set or impose \nan agenda. Psychoanalysts try to understand a \nunique process set in motion by the patient\u2019s pre\u00ad\noccupations, anxieties, difficulties, character and, \nabove all, by his or her way of relating. Exploring \nsensitive personal areas requires a stable, sympa\u00ad\nthetic yet objective discipline. The approach is \nbased on a view that everyone is subject to a flux \nof internal conditions, which to some extent are \nalways going to be difficult for the individual \nto deal with or fully acknowledge. The psycho\u00ad\nanalyst\u2019s theoretical knowledge and personal \nanalysis provides a detailed familiarity with the \nnature of these internal states and the powerful \nfeelings associated with primary relationships in \nthe child and the adult. \nIn psychoanalysis, the patient uses the couch, \nhas sessions five times a week, and the treatment \nlasts for some years. Although in some ways it can \nbe likened as much to education as to a form of \ntreat ment, in significant respects it differs from \nboth. Like any significant piece of learning, psycho\u00ad\nanalytic change occurs slowly but the emotional \nand cognitive developments that are involved are \nbased on learning by internalisation rather than \nlearning by rote, or memorising. This internalisa\u00ad\ntion process involves the patient in a sustained \ncontact with previously under\u00adexplored areas of \ntheir personality as they function within the spe\u00ad\ncialised relationship between patient and analyst \n(Milton, 2001). Analysts use their knowledge and \ntraining to be able to see into, to challenge, and to \ncontain and to tolerate the areas of difficulty the \npatient brings. As a result, the patient gradually \ntakes in a capacity to feel more comfortable with \nthese and other emotionally difficult areas.\n Psychoanalysis can be engrossing and fascinating. \nBecause of its meaningfulness many patients feel \nmuch supported, partly because of its openness to \nemotionally demanding or turbulent areas. This \nexplains why many people will make considerable \nsacrifices to have an analysis. However, it is not \nto everyone\u2019s taste or liking. Psychoanalysis has \nthe capacity to evoke great hatred and contempt as \nwell as great appreciation and gratitude.\nTo make the value of psychoanalytic thinking \navailable to patients for whom a full analysis is \neither impossible for practical reasons, or not indi\u00ad\ncated for clinical ones, many shorter or less inten\u00ad\nsive forms of individual and group psycho therapy \nhave been devised. The general psychoanalytic \nmodels that underpin these applications remain \nnon\u00addirective and are offered in short\u00ad, medium\u00ad \nand longer\u00adterm formats. Centres of psychotherapy \nBox 2 Problems with single-disorder research \nand treatment guidelines \nApparently exact rates of diagnosis \u2022\u2022\nlend pseudo\u00adobjectivity to the familiar \ntaxonomy\nResults depend on which of several \u2022\u2022\ndiagnostic schemes is used (Goldberg & \nGoodyer, 2005)\nA minority of patients satisfy the criteria \u2022\u2022\nof only one diagnosis. Patients meeting \ncriteria for major depressive disorder are \nnine times more likely than chance to meet \nthe criteria for other conditions (Angst & \nDobler\u00adMikola, 1984, 1985)\n57.5% of patients with depression also have \u2022\u2022\nanxiety disorders (Kessler et al, 2003) \n50\u201390% of patients with Axis I conditions \u2022\u2022\nalso meet the criteria for other Axis I or Axis \nII disorders (Westen et al, 2004)\nIndex presentations commonly change over \u2022\u2022\ntime, with the features of depression, anxiety, \nphobic or obsessive\u00adcompulsive disorders \nnow uppermost, now unobtrusive \nPatients complain of problems of functioning \u2022\u2022\nand of life not captured by measures of \nsymptoms or categorical diagnoses\nAdvances in Psychiatric Treatment (2008), vol. 14. http:\/\/apt.rcpsych.org\/404\nTaylor\nin the UK offer a model of once\u00adweekly psycho\u00ad\nanalytic psychotherapy over 1 year (45 sessions), \nor occasionally a little longer. The social insurance \nfunded healthcare systems of a number of European \ncountries routinely fund up to 300 sessions of \ntwice\u00ad or thrice\u00adweekly psychoanalytic psycho\u00ad\ntherapy sessions. \nOver the years a number of more structured, and \nusually short, forms of psychodynamic therapy \nhave also been developed. Typically, these include \nactively formulating a focus on the particular \nunconscious operations and emotions thought to \nunderlie the patient\u2019s symptoms and complaints. \nThe model of Davanloo (1980), for instance, is \norganised around the idea of a triangle of conflict \n(feelings, anxiety and defence) and a triangle \nof person (past, therapist and current) to frame \ninterventions. The brief psychotherapy model of \nMalan (1976) is similar. However, although these \nstructured approaches are more concerned with \nachieving specific focal aims, patients are still \noffered and still obtain insight. They are not given \nhomework or didactically taught mental skills \nsuch as thought\u00admonitoring and re\u00adframing.\nA brief account of the psychoanalytic \nunderstanding of depression\nPsychoanalysis regards mourning and depression \nas types of bio\u00adpsychological reactions to loss (Box \n3). Any significant loss stimulates fear, anxiety \nand anger. The activity of the emotional system \nconnected with fight or flight is triggered and \nemotional systems to do with nurturance are \nenormously disturbed. These powerful emotional \nreactions have to be managed by the organism. \nFreud (1917) com pared the mental processes \ninvolved in mourning with those in depression. \nThe ability to mourn is an adaptive capacity \ninvolving relinquishment. It can lead to mental \ngrowth and the return of the capacity to feel love \nat a new level. Relinquishment is more difficult for \nthose susceptible to depression, because of under\u00ad\nlying difficulties with tolerating the fundamental \nseparate ness of the loved object. Such individuals \nare unable to cope with the love and the hate that \narise in connection with absence while at the same \ntime feeling to some degree secure. Their common \norigin in loss means that these two major states of \nmind can coexist and also interact with each other \nin very significant ways.\n Mourning the lost object is one of the ways it is \npossible to recover from depression. This is what \nis happening over the course of the self\u00adlimiting \ndepressions that so commonly occur at the turning\u00ad\npoints of life. In mourning, individuals remain \nconsciously preoccupied with whom or with \nwhat has been lost, but in deep depression people \noften no longer know why they are depressed. In \nmourning it is the world that is felt to have lost \nmeaning but in depression it is the self that is \nviewed as diminished or bad. The self undergoes \nthis alteration through its becoming identified with \nthe lost object. Identification is an unconscious \nmechanism which involves \u2018becoming the same \nas\u2019. In depression, identification occurs on the basis \nof sympathy with the object, sometimes out of guilt \nor sometimes as a way of keeping the relationship \nwith the lost person present\u00adwithin rather than \nabsent\u00adwithout. \nThe explanation of these differences between \nmourning and depression rests on the finding \nthat the acceptance of the loss is more difficult \nin depression (Klein, 1940). Although we would \nbe faithless and shallow if we lacked all tenacity \nin our relations with the world, in those with a \nvulnerability to depression the possibility that \nthe tie to the object might be loosened feels not \npossible. There tends to be too much ambivalence \nand insecurity in relation to the love object to allow \nfor this. There is a conflict between feelings of love \nand antagonism. Also, a desperate effort to spare \nthe loved object from aggression lends intense \npainfulness to the internal struggles of the person \nwho is prone to depression.

The superego is coloured by \nthe individual\u2019s own hostile and envious feelings \nso that, other things being equal, the more an \nindividual controls his or her aggression towards \nothers the more severe their superego becomes. \nAlthough ultimately our dispositions are the \noutcome of gene\u2013environment interactions of \nenormous complexity, the emotional work we are \nable to do with the troubles of our own minds can, \nover the course of time, make a big difference to \nour final outcome.\nThe outcome evidence for \npsychoanalytic\/psychodynamic \ntreatments of depression \nThe observations summarised in Box 2 support \nthe view of many clinicians that the current way \nof classifying and analysing data dismembers \nother wise instructive relationships that exist \nbetween the different types of symptom found \nin patients with a broader category of \u2018common \nmental disorder\u2019. However, the idea of distinct, \nhomogeneous mental \u2018diseases\u2019 has dominated \nresearch and guideline development (including \nthose of NICE) in the past 25 years, exerting great \ninfluence on the type of study done and the kind of \nresults available. (For a good general review of the \nevidence for psychodynamic therapies see Fonagy \net al, 2005.) What follows will therefore include the \nresults of some meta\u00adanalyses and trials that have \nused the concept of common mental disorders as a \nway of describing their study populations. \nShort-term psychodynamic \npsychotherapy\nIn line with general usage, the various shorter\u00adterm \nformats, whether structured or non\u00addirective, will \nbe referred to collectively as short\u00adterm psycho\u00ad\ndynamic psychotherapy (STPP). Most of the RCTs \nexamining the efficacy of psychoanalytic or psycho\u00ad\ndynamic approaches have studied forms of STPP. \nUsually this means no more than 20 sessions. \nEfficacy of psychological therapy in the treatment \nof generic disorders\nIn a mother of all meta\u00adanalyses, a meta\u00adanalysis \nof 45 meta\u00adanalyses of the results of a wide variety \nof brief psychological, educational and behavioural \ntreatment trials for an equally wide range of non\u00ad\npsychotic disorders, Lipsey & Wilson (1993) came \nup with an estimate of the efficacy of psycho logical \ninterventions as a \u2018generic\u2019 type. They found an effect \nsize of +0.76 for all forms of psycho logical therapy \nwhen compared with waiting\u00adlist or minimal\u00ad\ntreatment control conditions. This indicates that \nthe post\u00adtreatment symptoms of those who receive \nany form of brief psychological therapy will be \nabout three\u00adquarters of a standard deviation better \nthan that of those who do not. This is a worthwhile \nbenefit, but under the limited parameters of brief \ntherapy research it has been hard to demonstrate a \nclear magnitude of difference between this size of \neffect and that associated with placebo or \u2018treatment \nas usual\u2019 (TAU), especially should the treatment be \nof a good standard. \nThe reader will come to see how, in spite of \nnumerous efforts to pick it apart, a persistent \nthread of non\u00adspecificity runs through the findings \nof psy cho logical therapy research trials. This so\u00ad\ncalled \u2018equivalence paradox\u2019 refers to how difficult \nit has proved for outcome research to demonstrate \nspecific differences, whether according to degree of \neffect, diagnosis or type of psychological therapy. \nFor this reason, experienced psychotherapy re\u00ad\nsearchers sum marise the previous decades of \nresearch in their field with conclusions such as, \n\u2018the generic efficacy of psychotherapy compared \nto no\u00adtreatment has been established for a long \ntime \u2026 from mildly disturbed persons with \nspecific limited symptoms as well as from severely \nimpaired patients \u2026 study after study, meta\u00ad\nanalysis after meta\u00adanalysis, have empirically \nvalidated psychotherapy as a treat ment\u2019 (Lambert, \n1992: p. 97). Luborsky et al in 1975 applied the term \n\u2018Dodo bird effect\u2019 to the way every research camp \nin psychological therapy would present data that \nprove that its favourite is the best, while the rival is \nperfidious. The description refers to Lewis Carroll\u2019s \nAlice in Wonderland, in which the Dodo silences the \nbitter squabbles at the end of a race by announcing \nthat \u2018everybody has won and all must have prizes\u2019. \nThe stability of Luborsky et al\u2019s conclusion was \nmore recently confirmed by Wampold et al (1997).\nEfficacy of generic psychological therapies in the \ntreatment of depression\nRobinson et al (1990), in their admirably lucid review \nof 58 controlled studies of the use of psychotherapy \nwith patients with a formal diagnosis of depression, \nAdvances in Psychiatric Treatment (2008), vol. 14. http:\/\/apt.rcpsych.org\/406\nTaylor\nfound effect sizes of 0.73 post\u00adtreatment and \n0.68 at follow\u00adup. These are of the same order as \nthose quoted above for a much wider group of \ndisorders. Their figures indicated that collectively \nthese differ ent types of psychological therapy offer \na moderate benefit in the treatment of depression \ncompared with no treatment. Although the \nauthors\u2019 initial analysis found the effect sizes for \ncognitive, behavioural and cognitive\u2013behavioural \ntherapy (CBT) to be about twice those of \u2018general \nverbal therapies\u2019 (a category that included STPP), \nthey found that this difference disappeared when \nthe treatment allegiance of the researcher and the \nquality of the trial were taken into account. Their \nultimate finding was that there was \u2018no reliable \ndifference\u2019 between the efficacies of different forms \nof therapy in the treatment of depression. Each \nform was making roughly equal contributions to \nthe final overall effect.\nEfficacy of STPP compared with no or minimal \ntreatment for diagnosed depression\nThe Cochrane review by Abbass et al (2006) found \nonly two RCTs of sufficient quality giving data on \nthe more exact question of the efficacy of STPP v. \n\u2018no treatment\u2019 or TAU in patients with a formal \ndiagnosis of depression. This was out of a total \nof 23 RCTs examining STPP in the treatment of \ncommon mental disorders. In an earlier review, \nLeichsenring et al (2004) had found a third study. \nThe three studies were as follows.\nDe Jonghe et al (2004) In the treatment of \nadults with mild to moderate major depressive \ndisorder (75% having an illness of less than 2 \nyears\u2019 duration), the authors compared a form of \nSTPP (maximum of 16 sessions) alone with STPP \nand antidepressant medication. Although there \nwere marked differences in their acceptability to \npatients, the efficacy of both formats in terms of \neffect size, imputed on the basis of the difference \nbetween baseline measures and measures at 24 \nweeks in the two groups, was large (\u2265 0.8) and \nmore or less equivalent. Note how similar this is to \nthe value reported by Lipsey & Wilson (1993). This \nstudy is considered further below.\nThompson et al (1987) In the treatment of ma\u00ad\njor depressive disorder in the elderly the authors \ncompared 16\u201320 sessions of STPP with an equiva\u00ad\nlent number of CBT and behavioural therapy ses\u00ad\nsions and a waiting\u00adlist control state. By the end \nof 6 weeks, patients in the treatment conditions \nshowed improvement of the familiar order, where\u00ad\nas controls did not. The results of this study also \nhave a bearing on the comparative efficacy of the \ndifferent forms of psychotherapy (see below). \nCooper et al (2003) In the treatment of postnatal \ndepression, the authors investigated the efficacy of \nthree forms of brief intervention, one of which was \n10 sessions of psychodynamic therapy, compared \nwith routine primary care, in post\u00adpartum women \nmeeting the criteria for major depressive disorder. \nAt 4\u00bd months, 70% of the psychodynamic cohort \nwere judged to be recovered, compared with 40% \nof the control condition. By the 9\u00admonth follow\u00adup, \nhowever, the benefit of treatment over usual care \nwas no longer evident. Moreover, the three forms \nof therapy did not reduce the incidence of further \nepisodes of postnatal depression. Psychodynamic \npsychotherapy did, however, seem to accelerate \nrecovery, which in the majority of cases would \nhave occurred but more slowly. This study had a \nlong 5\u00adyear follow\u00adup, unlike most RCTs.\nEfficacy of STPP compared with no or minimal \ntreatment for common mental disorders\nAccording to psychoanalytic theory depression, \nanxiety, obsessional features, personality problems \nand a variety of more subtle manifestations \nare thought to be interconnected in a dynamic \nway. Like an increasing number of psychiatrists, \npsycho analytically informed clinicians and \nresearchers have serious reservations about the \nvalidity of using the single\u00addiagnosis concept of \ndepression in outcome trials. Many have argued \nthat it makes more sense to study the effects of \ntreatment in patient samples that include mixed \nor combined disorders. The search criteria used in \nsingle\u00addisorder guidelines such as those of NICE \nhave tended to exclude the findings of studies of \nthis sort. \nLeichsenring et al (2004) This review found \nseven RCTs of sufficient quality which had \nexamined STPP against no treatment or TAU for \na mixture of common mental disorders. Short\u00ad\nterm psychodynamic psychotherapy was found \nto be \u2018significantly superior\u2019 to these placebo \nconditions, with effect sizes ranging from 0.59 to \n1.17 depending on the domain measured (target \nproblem, general psychiatric symptoms and social \nfunctioning) and the measure used. \u2018No treatment\u2019 \nconditions were found to have \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 \neffect sizes, which ranged from 0.12 to 0.27, while \nTAU was found to be capable of more substantial \nbenefits, ranging from 0.22 to 0.95, depending \npresumably on the intensity, adequacy and quality \nof the TAU provided. \nAbbass et al (2006) This review of 23 RCTs exam\u00ad\nined the efficacy of STPP relative to no treat ment or \nTAU in the category of common mental disorder. \nAdvances in Psychiatric Treatment (2008), vol. 14. http:\/\/apt.rcpsych.org\/ 407\nPsychotherapies for depression\nThey pooled patient samples which had originally \nbeen selected on the basis of several specific com\u00ad\nmon disorder diagnoses. In addition to depression, \nthese included somatoform disorders (irritable \nbowel syndrome, chronic pain, etc.), anxiety and \npersonality disorders and the hetero geneous \nmixture of disorders found in a non\u00adresponding \nsample of non\u00adpsychotic general psychiatric out\u00ad\npatients. Some of the studies were of samples of \npatients with chronic, difficult\u00adto\u00adtreat disorders \nand co morbid substance misuse. Only 8 overlapped \nwith Leichsenring\u2019s et al\u2019s review. Combined, the \n23 trials involved 1431 patients. Results indicated \nthat STPP (for a mean of 15 sessions) produced \nmodest to moderate gains across a wide range of \nsymptom categories for a wide variety of patients. \nFurthermore, these gains were often sustained or \nhad increased at longer\u00adterm follow\u00adup.\nSvartberg & Stiles (1991), Crits\u00adChristoph (1992), \nAnderson & Lambert (1995) For mixed disorders, \nthese three meta\u00adanalyses of all found STPP to be \nsuperior to no treatment or minimal treatment at \nboth short\u00ad and longer\u00adterm follow\u00adups.\nEfficacy of STPP compared with no or minimal \ntreatment for depressive symptoms in common \nmental disorders\nThe composite, common mental disorder group \nassembled in the reviews of Leichsenring (2001) \nand Abbass et al (2006) included many patients with \nsignificant depressive symptomatology across the \ndiagnostic categories. Of the 23 studies in Abbass\u2019s \nreview, 14 had employed measures of depression. \nIn terms of relief from depressive symptoms these \nshowed in the short term (\u2264\u20093 months, 11 studies) a \nstandardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.59, in the \nmedium term (3\u20139 months, 5 studies) an SMD of \n0.41, and in the longer term (\u2265\u20099 months, 6 studies) \nan SMD of 0.98 relative to controls. These amount \nto moderate treatment effects and, in line with \ntrend, the longer\u00adterm follow\u00adup finding is more \nsubstantial.\nEfficacy of STPP compared with other forms  \nof psychological therapy\nThe meta\u00adanalyses of Crits\u00adChristoph (1992) and \nAnderson & Lambert (1995) similarly found STPP to \nbe equal in efficacy to other forms of psychological \ntherapy, as did the Leichsenring et al (2004) study. \nOnly one meta\u00adanalysis, that of Svartberg & Stiles \n(1991) found STPP to be less effective than other \nshort\u00adterm treatments such as CBT. However, when \ncontrols for quality were introduced, this putative \nsuperiority evaporated.\nEfficacy of STPP compared with CBT  \nand behavioural therapy for depression\nChurchill\u2019s et al\u2019s (2001) systematic review of \ncontrolled trials of brief psychological treatments \nfor depression, part of the NHS Health Technology \nAssessment programme, found six studies (five \nrandomised controlled and one controlled clinical \ntrial) comparing STPP with CBT in formats of less \nthan 20 sessions.\nPooling dichotomous recovery\/non\u00adrecovery \ndata suggested that, by the end of the treatment, the \nodds of recovery for patients receiving CBT were \nat least twice those for patients receiving STPP.\n However, the reviewers noted the possibility of \na bias towards the CBT condition in these trials. \nMore than half the studies were conducted by \nresearchers with a CBT preference; these trials had \nused psychodynamic therapy only as a secondary \ncomparison condition. Again, when ratings for \nthe quality of the trial and the quality of treatment \ndelivery were included, this marked difference \ndisappeared.\n The difference reported between CBT and brief \npsychodynamic treatments also disappeared when \nfollow\u00adup data were reported. In two of the studies \nthis was at 3 months, and in a third at 1 year. The \nremainder did not report follow\u00adup data.\nLeichsenring (2001) came to similar con clusions. \nHe confirmed that STPP was associated with statis\u00ad\ntically significant reductions in depressive \nsymptoms before and after treatment. Out of a \ntotal of 60 possible comparisons between STPP and \nCBT he found no difference in 58, and a small effect \nin favour of CBT in 2. He calculated the mean \n\u2018before and after\u2019 success rates of STPP and CBT as \n46% and 54% respectively \u2013 equivalent to a small \neffect size in favour of CBT. Wampold et al (2002) \nreported similar findings.\nEfficacy of psychotherapy compared with \nantidepressants\nAccording to Roth & Fonagy (2004), when psycho\u00ad\ntherapy and medication are offered alone they \nseem to be of roughly equivalent efficacy. Most, \nbut not all, of this evidence is from interpersonal \ntherapy and CBT studies. The earlier review of \nRobinson et al (1990) found 15 studies examining \nthis question, including a few looking at the effect \nof com bining psychological therapy with anti\u00ad\ndepressants. Eight of these 15 studies were of CBT, \nthree were of behav ioural therapy and four tested \nwhat the authors describe as \u2018general verbal\u2019 \ntherapy, which includes dynamic approaches.\nThe studies yielded a small effect size in favour of \npsychological therapy, but this may be an artefact. \nOnce again, when allegiance effects (Luborsky \nAdvances in Psychiatric Treatment (2008), vol. 14. http:\/\/apt.rcpsych.org\/408\nTaylor\net al, 1999) were taken into account no reliable \ndifferences could be found between psycho logical \ntherapy and pharmacotherapy. Publication bias \nand selective reporting are now known to have \ninfluenced findings bearing on this question.\nHowever, there is some evidence (Thase et al, \n1997) that antidepressants are more efficacious for \npeople with more severe depression than for those \nwith depression of mild to moderate severity, or \nthose for whom complex psychosocial factors of \nhistory and personality are significant parts of the \npresentation.\nEfficacy of combined treatments\nAugmenting STPP with antidepressants (v. STPP \nalone) De Jonghe et al (2004) examined the issue \nof whether the addition of antidepressants to 16 \nsessions of STPP would improve on the outcome \nof major depression of mild to moderate severity \ntreated with STPP alone. A sample of about 200 \npsychiatric out\u00adpatients with major depressive dis\u00ad\norder was treated and followed up over a 6\u00admonth \nperiod.\nBoth treatment packages produced broadly \nequivalent positive effects. The success rate in \nthe STPP\u00adalone arm was 73% as against 81% in \nthe combined treatment arm, with pre\u2013post effect \nsizes on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression \n(HRSD) of 1.22 and 1.53 respectively. By 24 weeks, \nHRSD ratings had fallen from an initial average \nof 18 to one of 10. The comparison findings \nindicated a small benefit in favour of combining \nanti depressants with STPP, but these reached \nsignificance only in respect of the patient\u2019s self\u00ad\nreport measure (with a medium effect size of 0.49). \nBecause there was no drug placebo control in the \ntrial the mechanism of this effect is uncertain.\nOther important findings concerned the strength \nof patients\u2019 attitudes to the two kinds of treatment. \nAlthough 25 % of psychotherapy patients broke off \ntheir treatment, psychotherapy still seemed to be \nmore acceptable. More patients refused to enter the \npharmacotherapy arm in the first place, and by 6 \nmonths a further 35% had withdrawn from it. \nAugmenting antidepressants with STPP (v. anti \u00ad\ndepressants alone) Burnand et al (2002) investi\u00ad\ngated the question of combined therapy the other \nway around: augmenting antidepressant medica\u00ad\ntion with a 10\u00adsession form of STPP, administered \nin this case by well\u00adtrained nurses, to enhance \nthe outcomes of patients in an acute\u00adphase major \ndepressive episode. The patients had been referred \nto an out\u00adpatient psychiatric service, and had \nmoderate to severe degrees of depression; half \nhad had previous episodes; half had some form \nof personality disorder. They were as a whole \nslightly more ill than the de Jonghe et al (2004) \nsample. The final sample analysed consisted of 74 \npatients randomised to the two conditions \u2013 anti\u00ad\ndepressants (mainly clomipramine) combined with \nsupportive time with a designated key worker v. \nantidepressants plus 10 sessions of STPP with a \ntrained nurse\u00adtherapist.\nAfter the 10\u00adweek treatment period the mean \nHRSD scores in both groups had reduced from \nabout 24 to about 9 (P > 0.001) but with little \ndifference between the comparison conditions on \nthis measure.\nHowever, the combination of STPP and anti\u00ad\ndepressants was better than antidepressants alone \non several other important indices: patients who \nreceived STPP were significantly less likely to still \nmeet the criteria for major depressive disorder after \n10 weeks (9%) than those who had not (28%).\nThe combination group needed significantly \nfewer days off work (46 v. 57), and they had both \na lower rate and fewer days of hospitalisation. \nCost\u2013benefit comparisons showed that STPP plus \nantidepressants had resulted in savings of $2311 \nper patient over the 10\u00adweek period. For patients \nin full employment before they became ill savings \nwere greater ($3394). \nOnce it is recollected that depression can be a \nlong\u00adterm relapsing condition, the drawbacks of \nthe trials summarised above are hard to deny in \nrespect of all types of treatment. They are nearly \nall concerned only with the short\u00adterm outcome \nof brief treatments. The findings of trials of this \nkind also suggest a ceiling on the effects of brief \ntherapies of whatever type. To go beyond these \nlimitations it is important to look to studies of \nlonger\u00adterm treatments of patients with chronic \nor harder\u00adto\u00adtreat depression of one kind or \nanother. Furthermore, because the dysfunctions \nassociated with depression extend beyond what \nsymptom measures capture, we need to develop \nour understanding of these and to find ways of \nevaluating change.\nEfficacy of treatments of chronic or treatment\u00ad\nrefractory depression\nStimpson et al (2002) found 17 RCTs which exam\u00ad\nined various pharmacological approaches to the \ntreatment of patients with unipolar depression \nwho had not responded to a minimum of 4 weeks \nof antidepressant treatment.\nOn the basis of these 17 studies, they concluded \nthat there was little in the way of evidence to guide \nthe treatment of patients who had not responded \nto a first course of antidepressants. Within their \ncriteria, they found no satisfactory trials of \npsychological therapy for chronic or treatment\u00ad\nresistant depression.\nAdvances in Psychiatric Treatment (2008), vol. 14. http:\/\/apt.rcpsych.org\/ 409\nPsychotherapies for depression\nBy using more lax inclusion criteria, McPherson \net al (2005) did find a few studies of psychological \ntreatments, including single case studies. These \nmainly used CBT. Although they mostly showed \nreduction in symptoms, they all had short follow\u00ad\nup times and very small numbers. Interestingly, \nand presumably in response to the severity of the \npsychopathology, the CBT treatments involved \nseemed to be showing a marked tendency to \nbecome longer than the short 10 or 20 sessions that \nhave been a principle selling point of the method. \nIn one small study the eight participants had 39 \nsessions over 8 months \u2013 beginning to approach \nsomething like a medium\u00adlength psychodynamic \ntreatment!\nTwo RCTs are currently under way with this \npatient group. The Tavistock Adult Depression \nStudy (Publication ID M0001169680 at http:\/\/\nwww.nihr.ac.uk) is examining the efficacy of \nmedium\u00adterm (60 sessions) weekly psychoanalytic \npsychotherapy v. TAU in 90 patients with treatment\u00ad\nresistant depression. Eligibility criteria include at \nleast two failed treatments as well as a diagnosis of \nmajor depressive disorder. The average duration \nof illness is 10\u201315 years and most patients have \nbeen found also to meet the criteria for at least one \nDSM Axis II disorder. The trial is due to report in \n2010. A similar multicentre German RCT combined \nwith a naturalistic arm began last year. The \nLangzeittherapie bei chronischen Depressionen (LAC) \nstudy, led by Professor M. Leuzinger\u00adBohleber, is \ncomparing a longer psychoanalytic psychotherapy \ntreatment with CBT and has an intended sample \nof 240 (http:\/\/www.sfi\u00adfrankfurt.de\/forschung\/\nforschungsfeld\u00ad2\/depressionsstudie.html). \nEfficacy of long\u00adterm v. short\u00adterm \npsychodynamic\/psychoanalytic therapies  \nin depression and common mental disorders\nThe Helsinki Psychotherapy Study Group\u2019s RCT \n(Knekt et al, 2008) has compared the effectiveness \nof two forms of short\u00adterm therapy with a long\u00ad\nterm psychodynamic psychotherapy. So far follow\u00ad\nup data over 3 years have been reported. The study \nalso has an arm for full psychoanalysis, which is \nabout to report along with further follow\u00adup data. \nThe two short\u00adterm treatments were a problem\u00ad\nsolving solution (solution\u00adfocused therapy) (about \n10 sessions, including family work over 8 months; \nLambert et al, 1998) and a form of STPP based \non the Malan model (20 sessions over 6 months). \nThe long\u00adterm treatment involved 2\u20133 sessions \nof psychodynamic therapy a week over 3 years \n(average number of sessions was 232). The 326 \nparticipants, between 20 and 45 years of age, had \nbeen referred and treated as out\u00adpatients for mild \nto moderate DSM\u2013IV mood or anxiety disorders \nfor at least 1 year; 68% met the criteria for major \ndepressive disorder, 44% met those for generalised \nanxiety disorder, 18% met those for personality \ndisorder, and 9% had made a suicide attempt.\nAll three interventions were associated with \nsignificant reductions on all symptom measures \n(depression, anxiety and general). Over the 3\u00adyear \nperiod the average reduction in Beck Depression \nInventory (BDI) score was 51% (with effect sizes \nranging from 0.87 to 1.52). At entry the mean BDI \nscore was 18; in those given the two short\u00adterm \ntreatments this had come down to about 10, and in \nthose who had had long\u00adterm therapy it was about \n7. These benefits are comparable to those found in \nstudies involving CBT. \nParticipants who received the short\u00adterm treat\u00ad\nments typically showed an early response which \nreached an upper limit by 12 months. These gains \nproved lasting over the entire 3\u00adyear follow\u00adup.\nIn contrast, the long\u00adterm therapy group \ninitially lagged behind, showing significantly less \nimprovement over the first year. However, the \ngains in this group gradually increased so that by \nthe 3\u00adyear point on all measures their symptoms \nwere less than those of the short\u00adterm treatment \ngroups; with respect to anxiety they were four \ntimes more likely to be recovered, but with respect \nto the depression measures the difference was not \nof the same degree. This pattern has also been \nfound in other studies (Kopta et al, 1994).\n Overall, about 20% of those who initially met \ncriteria for personality disorder no longer did at 7 \nmonths. In the STPP group there was a continued \nreduction in the features of personality disorder, \nso that by 12 months only 9% met the criteria. This \ncontinued improvement in personality function\u00ad\ning did not occur in the solution\u00adfocused therapy \ngroup.\nEvidence from retrospective and prospective \nlongitudinal effectiveness studies\nPsychological therapies require the patients\u2019 \npersonal choice, voluntary mental work and \nengagement. Especially over the medium and longer \nterm, RCTs, with their analogies to medication \ntrials, do not fit easily with the requirements of \nhuman relatedness. Practically and ethically it \nis not possible to randomly allocate over long \ndurations. It is entirely unrealistic to require RCT \nevidence for the outcome of these longer therapies. \nInstead, the evidence from long\u00adterm and, until \nrecently, usually retrospective effectiveness studies \nneeds to be taken more seriously. \nA carefully designed naturalistic long\u00adterm \nfollow\u00adup in Germany of 402 patients (of whom \n128 had affective disturbances) who had received \npsych oanalysis and long\u00adterm psychoanalytic \nAdvances in Psychiatric Treatment (2008), vol. 14. http:\/\/apt.rcpsych.org\/410\nTaylor\npsychotherapy (Beutel & Rasting, 2002) showed \nthat a clinically representative group of patients \nwith significant depressive symptoms had moved \ninto the normal range of scores. At long\u00adterm \nfollow\u00adup, this group was doing better in terms of \ndays off work than the population norm. The study \nincluded in\u00addepth qualitative interviews that made \nit possible to discern distinct and differing pat\u00ad\nterns of change in the way that various personality \ntypes managed their thoughts and feelings. These \npatterns included the emergence of reflective \nfunctioning. \nOther studies have confirmed the clinical \nimpression that improvement may continue after \npsycho dynamic or psychoanalytic psychotherapy \nends. The Stockholm Outcome of Psychoanalysis \nProject, for example, has demonstrated that patients \ngained in strength and capacity after treatment had \nended (Sandell et al, 2000; Blomberg et al, 2001). \nDiscussion and conclusions\nDo short-term treatments cure \ndepression?\nRobinson et al (1990) enquired whether the clinical \neffects of short\u00adterm psychological and pharmaco\u00ad\nlogical treatments amount to a cure of depression. In \ntheir sample of studies the mean pre\u00adtreatment BDI \nscore was 21.8 and post\u00adtreatment this had fallen \nto 11.8. The corresponding figures for untreated \ncontrols were 20.7 and 18.1. The mean BDI score \nof unselected samples from the general population \nis 7.0. For the fraction of the general population \nthat is contented this comes down to 4.9. Thus, \nthese treatment effects move patients to within \n1 standard deviation of the general population \nmean, and to within 1.5 standard deviations of the \ncontented among us. These are not trivial effects \nbut even by the restricted sensitivity of the BDI \nthey suggest that on a good day the average well\u00ad\ntreated recipient of short\u00adterm treatments is still \nmore depressed than most of us on a bad day, \nand is even further from the ideal of normative \nfunctioning. The consistency of these estimates \npoints towards there being a ceiling to what can be \nachieved with short\u00adterm treatments.\nDoes the evidence base need to remain an \nindustry of small differences?\nIt is still possible to sum up the current state of \nevidence with the following blanket conclusion: \nantidepressant medication and the different \nvarieties of short\u00adterm psychological therapy are \ncapable of generating an improvement of about \n12\u201313 points on the BDI, and there is not much to \nchoose between them. Also, as clearly indicated \nby the findings of the Robins & Regier (1991) \nstudy, the \u2018placebo\u2019 effect in trials of treatments for \ndepression can be consistently large, amounting to \nan average of 10 points\u2019 improvement. \nViewed in this way, it is understandable that \nmany clinicians throw up their hands at a research \nbase that seems more like a heap of dust. It does \nseem that in respect of treatment research into \ndepression (and other common mental disorders) \nthe Dodo bird\u2019s judgement, at least, is alive and well. \nIt lives on in an evolutionary backwater maintained \nby three factors: the conviction that short\u00adterm \nRCTs are guardians of truth, the continued use \nof instruments that are insensitive to the many \naspects of patients\u2019 dysfunctionality that lie outside \nsymptom frames of reference, and a homoeopathic \nfantasy that brief psychological treatments are \nhighly potent. If these items stay as they are, the \ndifficulty of demonstrating informative differences \nbetween therapies will continue until the wishful \nside has overwhelmed realism, probably through \nsheer weight of numbers. \nWithin the remit of this article it has only been \npossible to present the evidence from outcome \ntrials, and that in a summarised, incomplete way. \nHowever, when we questioned the inclusion and \nexclusion criteria of guidelines, and the effect of \ncontinuing to use specific psychiatric diagnoses \nas an organising principle, we found that relevant \nevidence had got left out. Moreover, when we \nallow clinical experience a little more authority \nover short\u00adterm outcome research trials, other \npoints come into view. If we proceed to admit \nevidence from other kinds of science, a yet \nmore interesting range of conclusions becomes \npossible. Epidemiology, observations of natural \ncourse, developmental psychopathology, studies \nof psychosocial factors, life\u00adevents, experimental \nstudies and psychoanalytic findings themselves \nknow a great deal about the nature and origins of \ndepression and, in passing, provide supporting \nevidence for psychoanalytic theories about \ndepression. \nAlthough this more sophisticated conception of \nthe evidence base cannot tell us directly which \ntreatments will prove effective, it does enable us to \nknow the parameters of the disorder and the limits \non the plasticity of individuals. These are essen tial \nguides to the potential of different treatment. They \nare scales against which to measure some of the \nwilder claims. Psychiatry could go fur ther and re\u00ad\nintroduce other ideas, such as \u2018pro found\u2019 v. \u2018banal\u2019, \nto counter the narrowness of the sometimes \npseudostatistical significance\/non\u00adsignificance \nformula. \nAdvances in Psychiatric Treatment (2008), vol. 14. http:\/\/apt.rcpsych.org\/ 411\nPsychotherapies for depression\nConclusions \nThis wider view of evidence is consistent with the \nfollowing. \n\u2022\t Effect\t sizes\t for\t STPP\t similar\t to\t those\t for\t\nother therapies and, like them, superior to \nminimal treatment control conditions. The \nNICE depression guideline\u2019s solitary recom\u00ad\nmendation for psychodynamic approaches \nis \u2018Psychodynamic psychotherapy may be \nconsidered for the treatment of the complex \ncomorbidities that may be present along with \ndepression\u2019 (National Collaborating Centre \nfor Mental Health, 2004: p. 63). In the light \nof the wider evidence available this seems \nnugatory, especially when it is recollected \nthat comorbidity is more the rule than the \nexception. The guideline is under revision. \n\u2022\t A\ttendency\tfor\tthe\teffect\tof\tCBT\tto\tcome\tinto\t\nplay more quickly than that of STPP, but with \nlonger follow\u00adups the differential effect that \narises from this delay disappears (Shapiro et \nal, 1994).\n\u2022\t Longer-term\t psychodynamic\t and\t psycho-\nanalytic therapies, by addressing the dys\u00ad\nfunctions of persons, may have the potential \nto go above an efficacy ceiling that operates in \nshort\u00adterm treatments. There are indications \nthat patients in longer\u00adterm psychoanalytic \ntreatments begin to manifest qualitatively \ndifferent types of change, which can move \nthem further into the normal range.\n\u2022\t Although\t results\t from\t studies\t of\t combined\t\ndrug and psychological therapy may be \nmixed, there is evidence of \u2018extra value\u2019 \nfrom adding STPP to medication. Also, \nadding medication to STPP, especially where \nvegetative symptoms are pronounced, seems \nentirely sensible. There seem to be no trials \naddressing benefits from sequences of CBT\u2009\n\u2192\u2009STPP or STPP \u2192 CBT.\n\u2022\t The\treasons\tpatients\thave\tfor\tpreferring\tone\t\ntreatment over another, including one form \nof psychological therapy rather than another, \nhave been under\u00adexplored.\n\u2022\t The\t value\t of\t qualitative\t in-depth\t studies\t\nof single or small numbers of cases and of \nmore naturalistic designs has been under\u00ad\nestimated. \n\u2022\t We\tshould\tthink\ta\tlot\tmore\tabout\tthe\tplacebo\t\neffect and the disputes over valuable but \nlimited gains. The psychological mechanisms \ninvolved in the placebo response in depression \nhave a role in normal emotional life. The \nbelief in good medicines dispensed by good \npeople who can provide succour is one of \nthe features of normal mental functioning \nthat fails in depression. The restoration of \nthis belief\u00adfunction may be important for \nrecovery in depression.\nAll of these considerations are pointers towards \noptimal or enhanced services for patients suffering \nfrom the complex range of disorders that goes \nunder the general rubric of depression. \nDeclaration of interest\nD.T. is the clinical lead of the Tavistock Adult \nDepression Study, an RCT evaluating 18 months \nof weekly psychoanalytic psychotherapy in \nthe treatment of chronic, treatment\u00adresistant \ndepression.\nReferences\nAbbass, A.
