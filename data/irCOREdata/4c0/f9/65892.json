Similarly, the energy\nof the emitted photon in luminescent materials cannot be\nnegative, which implies a lower bond for the energetic\ndistribution spectrum !\u0001E\u0002 at E \u0003 0. Dating back as early\nas 1958, Khalfin first showed that this \u2018\u2018semifiniteness\u2019\u2019 of\n!\u0001E\u0002 implies that the magnitude and the phase of p\u0001t\u0002 are\nconnected with each other by integral relations, i.e., both\ncannot be chosen independently [1]. It turns out that,\nindependent of the exact form of !\u0001E\u0002, a true exponential\nfunction cannot fulfill these integral equations, but that the\ndecay of any metastable state eventually must proceed\nmore slowly. Finally, knowledge of only jp\u0001t\u0002j2, i.e., the\nreal decay kinetics, for all times allows one to analytically\ncalculate !\u0001E\u0002. The relative intensity of the nonexponen-\ntial contributions is fully determined by the value of the\nenergy distribution density at the cutoff energy of !\u0001E\u0002.\nConsequently, the nonexponential decay contribution is\nminor for an energy distribution density with small width\ncompared to the difference between the cutoff energy and\nthe center of !\u0001E\u0002, i.e., for processes with a large energy\nrelease and simultaneously narrow spectrum one would\nonly observe the exponential mode. In turn, the value of\n!\u0001E\u0002 at the cutoff energy is large for broad density dis-\ntributions with small energy release leading to early non-\nexponential contributions. Finally, no exponential decay at\nall is expected in the extreme case where the width, \u0001, of\n!\u0001E\u0002 becomes comparable or larger relative to the released\nenergy [2\u20134].\nExperimental searches for such deviations from the ex-\nponential law have mainly focused on decays of radioac-\ntive isotopes [5]. Unfortunately, in view of the above\nconditions on E and \u0001, such systems are in fact not suitable\nat all because the released energy is very large (E\u0005MeV)\ncompared to the width of the energy distribution (\u0001<\n10\u00049 eV). For the radioactive isotope 60Co, Norman\net al. observed the decay out to 30 exponential lifetimes,\nwhereas theoretically the deviation from exponential decay\nis expected at signal intensities of order 10\u000460 of the initial\nintensity corresponding to 140 lifetimes [5]. More recently,\ntheoretical effort has been directed to a range of atomic\nstates including spontaneous photon emission [6], or auto-\nand photoionizing states with very small release energies\n(E\u0005 0:01 eV) [7]. A common feature for all these atomic\nsystems are the well-defined energy levels, exhibiting only\nhomogeneous broadening, accompanied by (nearly)\nLorentzian line shapes and exponential lifetimes that are\ninversely proportional to the width of the energetic state\ndistribution, \u0001 \u0003 @=\u0001. Though such pure systems may\ntheoretically be accessible using coherent wave functions,\nwhen it comes to experimental confirmation, the predicted\ndeviations from exponential decay either occur at immeas-\nurable low signal levels, or for the more exotic atomic\nstates are too difficult to observe.\nInstead of small E, one may alternatively look at systems\nwith large \u0001. As an example this is achieved if the meta-\nstable state exchanges small amounts of energy with a\nsurrounding bath. The width of the decaying state increases\nwith increasing coupling to the bath leading to an earlier\nturnover into nonexponential decay, which has been nicely\nshown by Onley and Kumar by means of an exactly soluble\nsystem [3]. Another decaying system that couples to a bath\nis photon emission of dissolved (i.e., isolated) organic\nmolecules, which are studied here. To start with, the ex-\ncited states in such systems are localized (excitonic), the\nenergy released during the transitions is comparably low\n(E\u0005 2 to 3 eV), and, by using short laser pulses the\nexcitation can be achieved in a time much shorter than\nthe exponential lifetime. Likewise for atomic systems, in\nPRL 96, 163601 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending28 APRIL 2006\n0031-9007=06=96(16)=163601(4)$23.00 163601-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\nthe gas phase the excited state energy distribution of small\norganic molecules is narrow and couples to a whole range\nof electronic, vibrational, and rotational transitions [8].\nThus, these characteristics of small organic molecules do\nnot constitute any fundamental advantage over atomic\nsystems for the search of nonexponential decay. How-\never, this original narrow width is significantly increased\nin dissolved systems due to the inhomogeneous broadening\ninduced by the local solvent environment. Furthermore, for\nlarge molecules, !\u0001E\u0002 is further broadened by the particu-\nlar intermolecular structure, for example, the conjugation\nlength dispersion in conjugated polymers. Importantly, this\nadditional broadening of !\u0001E\u0002 has neither been paid for by\nan increase in E nor by reducing the exponential lifetime of\nthe state\u2014unlike for atomic systems, for organics \u0001 \u0001\n@=\u0001. Using this solvent interaction, one arrives at a sig-\nnificantly reduced ratio E=\u0001, which is the essential condi-\ntion for nonexponential decay [1,3,9].\nThe decay curves of a range of organic molecules and\npolymers dissolved in common solvents where thus mea-\nsured over 20\u201330 lifetimes, using time-resolved spectros-\ncopy as previously described in detail [10]. Briefly, in our\nspectrometer the sample is excited by a short laser pulse\n(170 ps, 7 mJ at 3.5 eV, repetition rate 10 Hz). A very fast\ngated ICCD camera (4Picos, Stanford Computer Optics,\n100 ps gate resolution) then monitors the spectrally dis-\npersed emission between any two user-defined points in\ntime. A time-correlated single photon counting system (ex-\ncitation at 390 nm, instrument response function 65 ps,\ndetection channel width 5 ps) was employed to verify the\nmeasurement of short exponential lifetimes.\nFor presentation we focus on two systems with proto-\ntypical character: the common laser dye Rhodamine 6 G\nand a blue-emitting polyfluorene-type conjugated polymer\nwith about 100 repeat units, see Fig. 1 for chemical struc-\ntures. The main part of this figure shows two normalized\nfluorescence spectra with detection times as indicated. The\ncorresponding decay curves for these emissions are shown\nin Fig. 2 on a double logarithmical axis. As expected,\ninitially both decays obey exponential laws (yellow and\ncyan solid lines). However, after a material dependent\nnumber of lifetimes (17 for Rhodamine 6 G and 11 for\npolyfluorene) the fluorescence decays significantly slower,\nturning into algebraic decay laws.\nBefore discussing this additional contribution to the\nexponentially decaying emission in more detail we shall\nbriefly comment on its intra- and monomolecular origin.\nFirst, in making use of the full decays, we refer back to the\nluminescence spectra of Fig. 1. Here, the time settings\nwere chosen such as to obtain characteristic spectra of\nthe two fluorescence contributions. Albeit not exactly\nidentical, certainly the spectra are isoenergetic. Also, the\nrelative intensities of both emission contributions are in-\nvariant of excitation energy [10]. In consequence, the\nalgebraic decaying fluorescence contribution cannot be\nassigned to spectral diffusion to low-lying energetic states\nwith a potential distribution of long lifetimes or other\nexternal impurity or defect sites. As with the exponentially\ndecaying contribution, the long-time fluorescence exhibits\na linear dependence on concentration (tested between 10\u00045\nand 10\u00043 g=g solvent) and on laser excitation dose (tested\nbetween 0.1 and 1000 \u0002J=cm2) [10]. Both of these obser-\nvations rule out any potential bimolecular origin of the\nlong-time fluorescence, such as diffusion limited triplet\nexciton annihilation, which obeys clearly different decay\nkinetics [10]. Also, intersystem crossing of the (relatively\nlong-lived) triplet excitons back to the singlet manifold\n(E-type delayed fluorescence) can safely be excluded as for\nthese materials the singlet-to-triplet exciton energy split-\nting is large compared to the thermal energy (typically\n\u0002ST\u0005 0:7 eV). Given that both contributions to the decay\ncan only be distinguished by their kinetics, we ascribe the\nretarded component to the theoretically predicted long-\ntime deviation from the exponential-decay law.\nIn this case, theory predicts an algebraic decay law for\nthe asymptotic time dependence with exponent, m \u0006 \u00042\n[9], which is consistent with the long-time behaviors\nshown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, the experimentally observed\nexponents from all materials tested so far range from \u00042:1\nfor some conjugated polymers up to \u00044:1 in the case of\nanthracene. In Table I measured data are given for a range\nof dissolved molecules. Qualitatively the ratio \u0001turnover=\u0001\nprovides a measure for the relative intensities of the non-\nexponential decay contributions, which are larger for\nsmaller values. Theoretically, nonexponential decay is es-\ntablished earlier for an increasing, residual excited state\ndensity at the cutoff energy, which in turn is determined by\nthe energetic density of states (DOS) distribution, espe-\ncially its width, \u0001, and its center energy, E.

Nevertheless,\nfor the exactly soluble systems, i.e., particle scattering,\netc., that have theoretically been studied it is found that\nbroad transitions (relative to the released energy) result in\nearly relative turnover times: [1\u20134,11]\n\u0001turnover\n\u0001\n\u0005 log\n\u0001\nE\n\u0001\n\u0002\n: (2)\nGiven the lack of an exact expression for organic systems,\nwe shall nevertheless qualitatively discuss whether Eq. (2)\ncan justify our observations. However, the situation is\nfurther complicated. As a consequence of the numerous\noverlapping vibrational and rotational transitions, for or-\nganic molecules, \u0001 is not directly accessible so we cannot\ntest Eq. (2) directly. On the other hand \u0001, \u0001turnover, and E\ncan accurately be measured and we may use Eq. (2) to\ncompute relative widths, which are given in the last column\nof Table I. These values should linearly depend on the real\nwidth of the excited state and as such allow for a qualitative\ncomparison of the different materials investigated here.\nRelatively low intensities of the nonexponential contri-\nbutions (i.e., late turnovers, narrow width) are generally\nobserved for small molecules including the laser dyes\nCoumarin 450 and 500, Rhodamine 6 G, the fluorene\noligomer with three repeat units and anthracene. Here,\nthe main contribution to the broadening of !\u0001E\u0002 is caused\nby the solvent. Because of its nonrigid structure, ring\ntorsions will additionally add to the value of \u0001 for the laser\ndye 2,5-bis(4-biphenyl) oxazole (BBO), which explains its\nlarger width compared to the other dyes. The turnover\nratios are significantly reduced from \u000517 for the rigid\nsmall molecules to 11 in case of the long conjugated poly-\nmer polyfluorene, which translates into approximately\n20 times stronger nonexponential contributions. Essen-\ntially this situation is shown in Fig. 2. Besides the matrix\neffects of the solvent, !\u0001E\u0002 of these long conjugated\npolymers is additionally broadened by the variation in\neffective conjugation length, which is intrinsically limited\nand much shorter than the length of the molecule.\nIlluminating in this context is the behavior of the three\nmembers of the fluorene family having different numbers\nof repeat units (n \u0003 100, n \u0003 10, n \u0003 3) otherwise being\nchemical identical. As the length of the molecule increases,\ni.e., the confinement of the excited state decreases, the\nintensity of the nonexponential decay contributions in-\ncreases. An exception within the long conjugated polymers\nis polyspirobifluorene [12]. Here the turnover into alge-\nbraic decay already occurs after less than nine exponential\nlifetimes have passed, which translates into roughly 10\ntimes stronger nonexponential emission contributions\ncompared to common conjugated polymers such as poly-\nTABLE I.

In conjunction with one of the highest slopes,\n\u00042:08, the nonexponential effects contribute 0.17% to the\noverall emission, which is the highest value for all mate-\nrials measured so far. Unlike polyfluorene, as a conse-\nquence of the so-called spiroconjugation for polyspiro-\nbifluorene the \u0003-conjugation extends into the side groups.\nTorsional fluctuations of these side groups around the\nspirolinkage introduce a third variable, besides the solvent\nand the normal conjugation length distribution that all\ncontribute to the increase of \u0001. The excited state in\nIr\u0001ppy\u00023 is a metal-to-ligand charge transfer state, which\nis again strongly affected by the solvent, leading to a\nlifetime-to-turnover ratio of 13.2 [13]. Because of ther-\nmally restricted relaxation, the lifetime of this heavy metal\ncomplex significantly increases from 0.9 to 3 \u0002s when\nmeasured at 77 K compared to room temperature. This,\nhowever, only leads to minor spectral changes; especially\nthe apparent width of the spectrum is unaltered [13].\nIndeed, at 77 K we observe the turnover into algebraic\ndecay more than 3 times later compared to room tempera-\nture, i.e., the ratio of \u0001turnover=\u0001 remains nearly constant.\nThis in turn translates into a constant spectral width as\nexperimentally observed giving strong evidence for the\nvalidity of Eq. (2). Finally, the excited state of the platinum\nphorphyrin complex PtOEP is essentially a metal transi-\ntion, which is mainly homogeneously broadened by the\nphorphyrin ligand field rather than by the surrounding\nsolvent, which yields a significantly smaller relative width.\nTo summarize the above, the strength of the nonexponen-\ntial components can, on a qualitative basis, be consistently\ncorrelated to a range of effects that cumulatively broaden\nthe density of states distribution.\nAlso included in Table I are the slopes of the correspond-\ning algebraic decay contributions. Whereas the relative\nturnover times are linked to the residual excited state\ndensity at the threshold, the decay exponents relate to the\nshape of the DOS [6,9,14]. Here, an exponent of \u00044 is\nexpected for Lorentzian-type excited state distributions,\nwhereas \u00042 indicates a Gaussian. This should be seen in\nview of the general knowledge that Lorentzian and\nGaussian are the standard models for homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous broadening, respectively. Unfortunately,\nfor the materials studied here we cannot evaluate the line\nshape [and thus !\u0001E\u0002] directly due to the omnipresent\nvibronic progression within the emission spectra. Never-\ntheless, the slopes given in Table I indeed indicate a\nturnover of the excited state distribution (concomitantly\nthe line shape) with the size of the molecule from a\nLorentzian for rigid small molecules such as anthracene\ntowards a Gaussian for long conjugated polymers. For the\nextremes, the homogeneously broadened metal centered\ntransition of PtOEP and the strongly inhomogeneously\nbroadened excitonic transition of polyspirobifluorene, we\nobserve the expected slopes close to \u00044 and \u00042 consisted\nwith homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening, re-\nspectively. For the latter two, this agrees well with the\napparent shape of the corresponding fluorescence spectra.\nIn conclusion, by using time-resolved spectroscopy and\nmeasuring fluorescence decays beyond 20 lifetimes, an\nadditional algebraic contribution to the monoexponential\nemission decay of many organic materials has been ob-\nserved. This constitutes the first experimental confirmation\nof long-time deviations from the exponential-decay law\nthat have theoretically been predicted for many years.\nHowever, this was only possible due to the additional\nbroadening of the excited state energy distributions, for\nexample, by the solvent, but has enabled us to verify one of\nthe most general findings of quantum mechanical decay\ntheory. Additionally, in exploiting Khalfin\u2019s original work\nit may be possible to reverse the problem by employing the\nobserved nonexponential decay contributions to analyti-\ncally gain the density of states distribution of organic\nmaterials, which are otherwise hard to measure [1].\nWe would like to thank Professor D.

Sato\nfor very useful comments on the manuscript; Professor U.\nScherf, Philips Research Eindhoven, and Merck for pro-\nviding materials as well as CENAMPS (Project No. CEN-\n04 Photonics Institute) for financial support.\n[1] L.
