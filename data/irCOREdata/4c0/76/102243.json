Introduction\nA variety of biological organisms (such as diatoms, sponges\nand grasses) are capable of incorporating silica in vivo at\nambient temperature and neutral pH. In the case of diatoms\nthis biosilicification of silica utilises monosilicic acid, Si(OH)4,\nas the starting material to create silicas with outstanding\ncontrol over morphology.1\u20133 Recently researchers have iso-\nlated the proteins responsible for silica precipitation and a\nnumber of proteins, polypeptides and synthetic polymers have\nbeen found to precipitate ordered and disordered silica struc-\ntures from either tetraalkoxysilanes or sodium silicate.3\u201316 It\nhas been postulated that the more pronounced effect of\npeptides compared to amines is not just due to the many\nelectrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds available within\nthe polymer but that the relative arrangement of the amino\ngroups is also important. Within a single molecule the electro-\nstatic and\/or hydrogen bond interactions are not thought to be\nsufficient to favour condensation.10,12\nWe have previously reported the use of polyviologens as\npotential catalysts for monosilicic acid polymerisation.16 Little\ndifference was observed with changes in counter-ion and alkyl\nspacer groups used. Although polyviologens are effective\ncatalysts for monosilicic acid polymerisation it is not possible\nto apply the variety of counter-ion and alkyl chain spacers we\nhave previously employed during the synthesis of sol\u2013gel\nhybrids as the solubility of the polymers in the aqueous buffer\nis a limitation.16 However, the work stimulated our interest\nin the catalytic and structure-directing effects of other\nstructurally well-defined cationic polymers. The use of readily\naccessible synthetic polymers to produce structurally-\ncontrolled silicas offers an attractive alternative to the use of\nnatural or synthetic proteins. The use of well defined block\ncopolymers with an anionic block has been shown to control\nthe crystal formation of barium sulfate.17 In Nature, the\nmediation of biomineralisation processes by amphiphilic\nmacromolecules is increasingly well understood.18 Here, we\ninvestigate a series of quaternised 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl\nmethacrylate (DMAEMA) homopolymers as well as well-\ndefined block copolymers of DMAEMA with methyl metha-\ncrylate (MMA) with varying degrees of quaternisation at a\nfixed chain length, and fully quaternised but with varying\nchain length (Fig. 1). The effectiveness of these polymers as\ncatalysts for monosilicic acid polymerisation as well as the\nnature of the hybrids and final silicas formed is described here.\n2.

The spectra were recorded on a\nVarian Unity Inova spectrometer equipped with a 7.5 mm\nmagic angle spinning (MAS) probe. The 29Si DP quantitative\nspectra were measured at ambient temperature using a 90u\npulse angle, a 120.0 s recycle, an acquisition time of 15.0 ms,\na spin-rate of ca. 5000 Hz and a frequency of 59.58 MHz\n(ca. 450 repetitions).

Scanning electron micrographs were recorded on a\nHitachi S-4000 or a Hitachi S-3200N scanning electron\nmicroscope. The Hitachi S-3200N was also used to acquire\nenergy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) data. Transmission\nelectron micrographs and electron diffraction data were\nrecorded on a Philips EM 400T transmission electron\nmicroscope.\nPolymer synthesis\nThe samples of PDMAEMA homopolymer and PDMAEMA\u2013\nPMMA diblock copolymer were prepared by group transfer\npolymerisation (GTP) in anhydrous THF at ambient tem-\nperature, as described previously.19 Partially quaternized\nPDMAEMA homopolymers and PDMAEMA\u2013PMMA\ndiblock copolymers were prepared by reaction with sub-\nstoichiometric quantities of methyl iodide, as described by\nVamvakaki et al.20 The fully quaternised PDMAEMA\nhomopolymers were prepared by atom transfer radical\npolymerisation (ATRP) of methyl chloride-quaternised\nDMAEMA monomer as described previously.21 Note that\nthe halide counter-ions differ for the homopolymers prepared\nby the different routes (chloride vs. iodide).\nCharacterisation data for all the quaternised polymers are\npresented in Tables 1 and 2. The abbreviations used to describe\nthese samples throughout this paper are presented in column\none of Tables 1 and 2.\nSilica precipitation\nMonosilicic acid polymerisation was carried out using\ndifferent protocols. Some reactions were performed with\nvarying polymer concentrations to maintain an equivalent\namount of quaternary ammonium groups across the polymer\nseries, while in others the polymer concentration was kept\nconstant and the degree of quaternisation varied. It was\nenvisaged that this would help to reveal differences in the rate\nof monosilicic acid polymerisation resulting from architectural\neffects of the homo- or block co-polymers such as the presence\nor absence of a hydrophobic unit and the length of the\nhydrophilic or hydrophobic block which might be expected to\naffect the conformation adopted in solution. In addition, some\nreactions were performed with a specific polymer at different\nconcentrations to see if there was any effect of concentration\nupon the reaction beyond the expected increase in rate as the\nproportion of quaternary nitrogen groups increases.\nThe method used was that employed by Coradin and\nLivage.12 Molybdosilicic acid titration was used to follow the\nrate of reaction.22 Sodium silicate solution (0.10 ml) was added\nto the buffer solution (30 ml) in a 50 ml conical flask. The\nmixture was stirred for 10 min before a solution of polymer\nin buffer (3 ml) was added. This represents a ca. 0.0047 M\nmonosilicic acid solution. Stirring was maintained throughout\nthe reaction. Periodically aliquots (400 ml) of the reaction\nmixture were taken and added to deionised water (5 ml).\nSulfuric acid (200 ml, 1.5 M) and ammonium molybdate\n(400 ml, 0.08 M) were added and the mixture left to stand for\n10 min before the UV absorption of the solution at 400 nm\nwas recorded. After 2 h the reaction mixture was centrifuged,\nand the recovered solids dried under a flow of air at room\ntemperature overnight.\nThe polymer\u2013silica hybrids were calcined in air at 650 uC for\n24 h in a muffle furnace.\n3. Results and discussion\nThe polymers were synthesised as described previously using\nGTP and ATRP;19\u201321 these two techniques ensure reasonably\ngood control over the molecular weight and molecular weight\ndistribution.

It\nhas further been shown that the hydrophobic PMMA block\nleads to self-assembly of the block copolymers in aqueous\nsolution,24 which allows the possible effect of using copolymer\nmicelles with cationic coronas (rather than molecularly\ndissolved cationic polymers) on silica catalysis to be explored.\nIt is anticipated that the precise structure of the polymer in\nsolution will itself be influenced by the presence of the\ncontinually changing silica species (in a similar way that\nsilicon precursor induced surfactant mesophase formation\nhas been known for some time25,26), but a detailed study of this\nbehaviour is beyond the scope of the current investigation.\nMonosilicic acid polymerisation\nWhilst a variety of precursors can act as the silica source, the\nchoice of silicic acid provides a comparison with an earlier\nstudy,12 while being directly relevant to the situation found in\nNature.4 The Tris-HCl buffer is chosen to avoid the presence\nof phosphate, which can interact with the silica. A kinetic\nstudy of silica formation using the molybdosilicic acid titration\nmethod provides a facile way of determining the catalytic\neffects of the various synthetic polymers examined in this\nstudy. The method used was analogous to that described by\nCoradin and Livage12 in their peptide study, although the\nconcentration of silicic acid was increased for practical\nreasons, but still within the accepted limits of the method.22\nDespite the various differences in the results of monosilicic\nacid polymerisation (discussed below) the results for all the\npolymers used share several features in common. In the\nabsence of polymer, the addition of sodium silicate solution\nto the buffer did not result in any visible precipitation and\nthe solution remained clear for at least 8 h. Nonetheless, a\ngradual decrease in silicic acid concentration was observed\nwith time (Fig. 2), suggesting the formation of soluble\noligomeric species. This is entirely as expected for silicic acid\ncondensation at neutral pH. The observed decrease in Si(OH)4\nconcentration is slightly greater than that found previously,12\nperhaps reflecting the increased starting concentration, as a\nstill greater effect has been observed with an even higher silicic\nacid initial concentration and poly(allylamine hydrochloride)\nas catalyst.10\nThe addition of polymer to the silicic acid mixture\nimmediately results in the solution becoming turbid and the\nformation of a visible precipitate is evident shortly thereafter\n(several minutes). A sharp decrease in the monosilicic acid\nconcentration (ca. 10%) is observed for all polymers within the\nfirst few minutes, in contrast to the blank (polymer-free)\nsample which shows a slow and steady decrease in concentra-\ntion (Fig. 2). Subsequently the curve flattens out and resembles\nthat obtained in the absence of polymer. The initial decrease\ncan be attributed to the precipitation of polysilicic acid caused\nby the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions with\nthe cationic polymer. After precipitation the polymer becomes\nincreasingly entrapped within the growing silica precipitate\nuntil it is unable to exert any catalytic effect on the remaining\nmonosilicic acid in solution. As the catalytic effect weakens,\nany further silica formation will proceed at a much lower rate\ntypical of the polymer-free reaction. Hence the rate of decrease\nin silicic acid concentration slows and eventually resembles\nthat observed in the absence of polymer, although differences\nare observed in the final silicic acid concentration. The silica\nproducts are true polymer\u2013silica hybrids, in the same way that\nnatural silica exoskeletons are proteinaceous hybrids. The\nability of the polymers to induce monosilicic acid polymerisa-\ntion remains effective for up to 30 min. Foaming was observed\nfor the amphiphilic block copolymer PMMA\u2013PDMAEMA-\n100. Because of the surfactancy of these polymers, this was not\nunexpected but it is not clear how much this affected the\nresults obtained.\nPDMAEMA homopolymer at varying degrees of quaternisa-\ntion and chain lengths. At a constant concentration of\nquaternary ammonium groups no differences beyond experi-\nmental error were observed for the fully quaternised polymer\n(QDMA) at varying chain lengths, as would be expected if the\nprimary controlling factor is the concentration of catalytic\nspecies (Fig. 2). At best, the final degree of condensation is\nslightly higher than for the uncatalysed case and comparable\nto the degree of condensation observed for polylysine at the\nsame pH.12 At this pH, the polypeptide also carries a positive\ncharge, resulting in electrostatic interactions with growing\nsilicate species, as expected for QDMA.\nAt a fixed polymer concentration, however, after the initial\nsharp drop in Si(OH)4 concentration in all cases, the longer\nchain length (QDMA100) polymer appears to polymerise\nmonosilicic acid more slowly than observed for the shorter\nchain lengths (QDMA30,60) as shown in Fig. 3. This results\nin an overall lower degree of condensation in the case of\nQDMA100. This is somewhat surprising when it is considered\nthat there are more quaternised ammonium groups present\noverall in the longer chain length polymer. This could be\nrelated to the slower micro-diffusion rate of the longer coiled\npolymer chains in the local environment of the polymerising\nsilicate species. It may also reflect a greater propensity for this\nFig. 2 Evolution with time of monosilicic acid content as measured\nby the molybdosilicic acid method in the presence of fully quaternised\nPDMAEMA (QDMA) with varying nominal chain lengths at a\nconstant concentration of quaternary ammonium groups at pH 7.2.\nPolymer : silica molar ratios 1.07 6 1023 (QDMA-100; m), 1.79 6\n1023 (QDMA-60; &), 3.586 1023 (QDMA-30;\u00a4).

The amount of unreacted\nsilicic acid remaining at the higher polymer concentration is\nactually greater than for the polymer-free sample, although the\noverall extent of reaction is greater for the lower concentration\nof polymer. This is in marked contrast to the results obtained\nfor QDMA30 which, although on the edge of experimental\nerror, appear to show an increase in the rate of monosilicic\nacid polymerisation with an increase in concentration and a\nsmall increase in extent of reaction compared to the polymer-\nfree case (Fig. 4). This would be expected from the increase in\nconcentration of catalytic groups. The results observed for\nPDMAEMA homopolymers at varying degrees of quaternisa-\ntion (Fig. 5) appear to support the idea of the polymer\narchitecture having an effect. Surprisingly, PDMAEMA-\n100 and PDMAEMA-35 polymerise monosilicic acid at a\nmarkedly faster rate than that observed with the PDMAEMA-\n63 polymer. In addition, while the overall extent of silicic acid\nreaction in the case of PDMAEMA-63 is comparable to the\npolymer-free case, the extent of reaction is much greater for\nthe other polymers, which are also more effective than\npolylysine at this pH and comparable to polylysine at pH 9.2,\nwhere the proportion of negatively charged silicate species is\nhigher.12 These apparently counter-intuitive results could\narise from differences in the solution conformation of the\npolymers, affecting the accessibility and catalytic efficiency of\nthe cationic sites. A detailed in situ study of polymer\nconformation through the course of the reactions would be\ninstructive, but is beyond the scope of this preliminary study.\nMMA\u2013DMAEMA block copolymers at varying degrees of\nquaternisation.

The less marked\ncatalytic effect of the PMMA\u2013PDMAEMA-16 diblock\ncopolymer is also reflected in the overall extent of reaction,\nFig. 3 Evolution with time of monosilicic acid content as measured\nby the molybdosilicic acid method in the presence of fully quaternised\nPDMAEMA (QDMA) with varying nominal block lengths (100, m;\n60, &; 30, \u00a4) at a constant polymer concentration (3.38 6 1025 M) at\npH 7.2.

Such a\ndifference between the 16% and 23% quaternised polymers\nwould not be expected on the basis of the difference in\nconcentration of catalytic groups alone. Inaccessibility of the\ncatalytic groups seems unlikely to be the reason for these\nresults, as the PMMA block should lead to micellar self-\nassembly, with the quaternised DMAEMA groups accessible\non the periphery of the micelle corona. One possible rationale\nis the effect of the 84% non-quaternised basic tertiary amine\ngroups, which could act as an inhibitor of silica formation\nthrough local buffering of solution pH to a value different to\nthat of the bulk solution pH.\nPolymer\u2013silica hybrid products\nAll the polymer\u2013silica hybrids were obtained as white solids\nand found to be amorphous by powder XRD. No evidence\nwas found for any specific ordering induced by the presence of\nthe polymers. FTIR analysis revealed the characteristic CLO\nstretch at 1670\u20131780 cm21 in all the hybrids, confirming the\npresence of polymer. This is consistent with the kinetic studies,\nwhich provide indirect evidence for encapsulation of the\npolymers within the growing silica network. Absorptions due\nto Si\u2013O\u2013Si bending and Si\u2013OH vibration at 800 and 950 cm21\nrespectively confirmed the incorporation of silica. A broad\nabsorption at ca. 1000\u20131220 cm21 is most likely composed\nprincipally of the Si\u2013O stretch with an additional component\nfrom the C\u2013O stretch.\nNuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

NMR spectroscopy also revealed that, although a\nsignificant difference was noted in the rate of monosilicic acid\npolymerisation with PDMAEMA-63 compared to the other\nhomopolymers (which both result in faster condensation), it is\nonly the fully quaternised polymer (PDMAEMA-100) that\nshows any significant difference in the hybrid structure by 29Si\nNMR (Fig. 7). An increase in the amount of Q4 species relative\nto Q3 suggests that using PDMAEMA-100 leads to a more\nfully condensed silica network. This makes sense if the\ncatalytic effect is related not only to the accessibility of the\ntrimethylammonium groups but also their local concentration\non the polymer backbone, which could lead to cooperative\neffects of several adjacent catalytic groups in the case of\nPDMAEMA-100, but not PDMAEMA-35. It is emphasised\nthat the kinetic effects described earlier refer only to the initial\nreduction in the concentration of the silicic acid, but not to the\nextent of subsequent condensation. These results demonstrate\nthat the factors which influence the initial condensation of\nsilicic acid are not necessarily identical to those which control\nthe later stages of condensation in these silicates.\nElectron microscopy. In general the hybrids consist of\naggregates of roughly spherical particles of varying size (which\nare for the most part below 0.1 mm). No significant differences\nin particle size were observed for hybrids formed from various\npolymer architectures or differing degrees of quaternisation.\nThe surface morphology of the aggregates varied from\nfairly smooth to relatively rough and it was not possible to\nrationalise the differences, if any, between samples. Energy\ndispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) revealed that the hybrids\nare composed mainly of silica. In addition to the expected\nsignal from the polymer, trace amounts of sodium and chlorine\n(primarily from the buffer solution) are also present. Elemental\nmapping reveals that the various elements are mostly\ndistributed fairly evenly throughout the samples except in\nrough areas where it appears that sodium and chlorine\npredominate (Fig. 8). It is not unreasonable that this is due\nto the formation of salt crystals; however, if they are present it\nis in sufficiently low quantities for the hybrids to remain\namorphous by powder XRD. It is not clear whether the images\nobserved under SEM accurately reflect the material as it is\nformed in situ rather than the effects of aggregation through-\nout the reaction and the subsequent drying process in a petri\ndish. Therefore, immediately after the addition of polymer to\nthe silica solution, aliquots of the cloudy suspension (contain-\ning precipitating material) were removed using a pipette,\nplaced onto holey carbon film and allowed to dry under a flow\nof air. The samples were then investigated using transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM) in order to better understand the\nin situ silica formation process.\nAnalysis of the hybrids by TEM revealed them to consist\npredominantly of amorphous roughly spherical particles in\naccordance with the results obtained from SEM; however,\nother particle shapes were also observed in varying quantities\n(Fig. 9). These shapes were regular and subsequent analysis\nrevealed that a variety of regularly shaped \u2018microcrystalline\u2019\nspecies were present in many of the hybrids. These were\ntypically found to be tetragonal in shape (Fig. 10, left) but rod-\nlike species (Fig. 9) were also observed. Diffraction patterns\nwere collected and confirmed that these species were crystalline\n(Fig. 10, right) and that all possessed a face centred cubic\nstructure, although the actual lattice parameters varied\nsomewhat (Tables 3 and 4). Although, as noted above,\nEDS showed that sodium and chlorine are present in\nsignificant amounts in certain areas, none of the lattice\nparameters analysed corresponded to the NaCl structure.\nThe formation of multiple morphologies may arise from\nkinetically-controlled crystal growth mediated by the presence\nFig. 7 Direct polarisation 29Si MAS NMR of hybrids containing\nPDMAEMA-35, PDMAEMA-63 and PDMAEMA-100.\n2206 | J.

The calcination temperature is below the\ntemperature at which significant phase changes normally\noccur in silica.22 The PDMAEMA homopolymer at varying\ndegrees of quaternisation produced crystalline silicas as shown\nin Fig. 11. Only the MMA\u2013DMAEMA copolymers at a low\ndegree of quaternisation produced crystalline silicas when\ncalcined, but this crystallinity was less marked than those\nobtained for the homopolymers.\nThe powder XRD patterns resulting from the calcination of\nthe hybrid containing PDMAEMA-35 (Fig. 11a), and to a\nlesser extent that obtained from the MMA\u2013DMAEMA-23,\nresembles that produced when sodium is not fully removed\nfrom sodium silicate solution that is subsequently poly-\nmerised.22 This is not too surprising, as EDS has shown that\nsodium is present in the hybrids. What is unusual is that this\ncrystal structure is not observed in all the final silicas.\nFig. 8 EDS mapping image shows Na+ and Cl2 are the main com-\nponents of the surface particles in the hybrid formed from QDMA30\n[SE 5 normal micrograph]\nFig. 9 TEM image shows nanoparticles with different shapes in the\nhybrid containing MMA\u2013DMAEMA-100 (scale bar 5 0.27 mm).\nFig. 10 TEM image (left) shows the occurrence of regular tetragonal\nshapes in the hybrid containing MMA\u2013DMAEMA-100 (scale bar 5\n0.45 mm).

The apparently anomalous behaviour of the\nMMA\u2013DMAEMA-100 copolymer is interesting, as its hybrid\nshows evidence for microcrystalline structures, but none are\nevident in the calcined silica. Clearly there is an effect of\npolymer structure on the structure of the final silicas,\nproducing different crystalline or amorphous structures. One\nunanswered question is whether the anion present in the\npolymer has an effect on the structure development and\nsubsequent crystallisation. Previous work with cationic ionene\npolymers saw no evidence for anion effects in the condensation\nreaction, but the effect on calcinations was not studied.16 In\nthe present case, the PDMAEMA-x polymers and the block\ncopolymers contain iodide ions, but the buffer solution\ncontains chloride hence masking any specific anion effect. It\nwould be of interest to investigate such effects in future work\nby controlling the nature of the anion in both the polymer and\nthe buffer.\nFor the PDMAEMA homopolymer an increase in the\ndegree of quaternisation may be responsible for an increase in\nstructure control (as discussed above, PDMAEMA-100 has a\nclear effect upon the silica structure of the hybrid) but the\nopposite appears to be true for the MMA\u2013DMAEMA\ncopolymer. A combination of electrostatic and topological\nfeatures is likely to be responsible for the structure-directing\neffect. The formation of crystalline silicas at such relatively low\ncalcination temperatures is most likely a consequence of the\neffect of the polymers in producing partial organisation of the\nsilica network in the hybrids and facilitation of further\nstructural reorganisation in the early stages of calcination,\nprior to thermolysis of the polymer. The extent of structural\norganisation in the first-formed hybrids is likely to vary\naccording to the spatial separation of the polymer and the\nsilica, with possible formation of some non-templated silica at\nthe surface of individual particles.\n4. Conclusions\nPDMAEMA at various degrees of quaternisation and its block\ncopolymer with methyl methacrylate are effective catalysts for\nmonosilicic acid polymerisation at neutral pH. Differences in\npolymer architecture have been shown to lead to differences in\nthe rate and extent of polymerisation as well as differences\nin the structure of the hybrids and silicas formed after\ncalcination. The work points to various competing factors\nwhich influence the catalytic activity and structure-directing\neffects of such synthetic cationic polymers, including polymer\nsolution conformation, micro-environment effects and ease of\nelectrostatic binding between cationic polymer groups and\nanionic silicate species. A much more detailed study of these\neffects might lead to sufficient fundamental understanding to\nultimately control polymer structure to permit precise tailoring\nof the final silica network structure. Although the hybrids are\nmostly amorphous, some microcrystallites are also present in\nthe hybrids immediately after formation. The exact nature of\nthese microcrystallites and their possible involvement in the\nstructure of the final silicas is unclear and warrants further\ninvestigation. This will include real time elevated temperature\nXRD studies.\nAcknowledgements\nFinancial support from the UK Engineering & Physical\nSciences Research Council (to GG and YTL) is gratefully\nacknowledged.
