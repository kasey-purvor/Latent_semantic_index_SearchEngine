One of\nthe remarkable properties of a-C is its smooth surface.1 Fur-\nthermore, depending on the composition, it is possible to\ndeposit a-C films having different properties. From the elec-\ntrical properties point of view, the sp3 fraction and the sp2\nclustering are two key considerations that dictate the density\nof states in the films.2,3 Potential electronic devices based on\na-C grown by pulsed laser deposition \u0001PLD\u0002 have been re-\ncently reported.4 In addition to PLD, there are a variety of\ndeposition methods for a-C such as magnetron sputtering,5\nplasma enhanced vapor deposition,6 filtered cathodic vacuum\narc,\n7\nand mass selected ion beams deposition.8 The a-C has\nbeen used in several applications that mainly exploit its me-\nchanical properties such as a protective layer for hard disk\ndrives where films with a high sp3 fraction have high\nhardness,9 a smooth surface,10 and low friction.11\nThermal annealing is a common technique to improve\nthe electrical properties of materials and contacts. The effect\non tetrahedral a-C is to induced graphitization from sp3 to\nsp2, increase the amount of sp2 clustering, and reduce the\nstress in the films.12 Pulsed UV laser annealing has been used\nto crystallize hydrogenated amorphous silicon.13\u201315 The merit\nof pulsed laser annealing \u0001PLA\u0002 with UV photons is that the\nlaser is absorbed close to the surface and the effect to the\nsubstrate is minimal compared to thermal annealing in a\nfurnace.\nPLA at visible and infrared wavelengths of a-C:H de-\nposited by plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposition has\nbeen reported and ablation of the films has been observed.13\nIn this study, we report the effects of PLA with UV laser on\nnonhydrogenated a-C films. The a-C films were deposited\nusing PLD on highly doped c-Si substrates in vacuum at a\nbase pressure of 10\u22126 Torr. Prior to deposition, substrates\nwere cleaned using solvents, then rinsed with de-ionized wa-\nter and blow dried using N2.\nA KrF Lambda Physik excimer laser \u0001LPX 210i\u0002, oper-\nating at 248 nm with 25 ns full width at half maximum pulse\nduration was used as the laser source for PLD. The highly\noriented pyrolytic graphite target \u0001Kurt J. Lesker, 99.999%\npure\u0002 was rotated during deposition to avoid ablation from\nthe same spot. The surface of the target was cleaned using\nlaser ablation before deposition with an energy density of\n12 J \/cm2. For film deposition, an energy density of 4 J \/cm2\nwas used at 10 Hz. The substrates were placed 6 cm away\nfrom the graphite target, and 80 nm thick a-C films were\ndeposited with a growth rate of 8.5 nm \/min.\nPLA of deposited samples was performed with the same\nlaser in a stainless steel vacuum chamber with a quartz win-\ndow, mounted on an automated translation stage. An 8\n\u00013 mm2 asymmetric pulse15 was scanned along the film at\n2 mm \/s at 20 Hz repetition rate. Energy densities of 30, 60,\n90, and 120 mJ \/cm2 were used at a base pressure of 3\n\u000110\u22124 Torr.\nA Renishaw 2000 Raman microscope with two types of\nexcitation laser, Ar+ \u0001514.5 nm\u0002 and semiconductor\n\u0001782 nm\u0002 lasers, were used for the visible Raman spectros-\ncopy. The Raman spectra were fitted using a Breit\u2013Wigner\u2013\nFano line shape to the G peak and Lorentzian line shape to\nthe D peak.16,17 The peak positions are around 1600 and\n1350 cm\u22121, respectively. The Lorentzian line shape is recov-\nered in the limit of 1 \/Q\u21920. The corrected G peak position\n\u0002max \u0001Ref. 16\u0002 is used as a G peak position in this study. The\nD and G peaks are attributed to the breathing mode of the\nsixfold aromatic rings and all sp2 sites, respectively. There-\nfore, the intensity ratio of the D and the G peaks, I\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002,\nindicates the degree of sp2 clustering in a-C films.16\nFigure 1 shows the Raman spectra of laser annealed a-C\nfilms. Significant changes are not observed with increasing\nlaser energy below 90 mJ \/cm2. However, the D peak inten-\nsity increases after 120 mJ \/cm2 PLA compared with the\nother samples at both excitation wavelengths. Figure 2 shows\nthe increase of the G peak position and I\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002 for sample\nirradiated at 120 mJ \/cm2, which indicates sp2 clustering.\nThe increase of the G peak position and the decreases of the\nI\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002 with decreasing wavelength of the exciting laser\nalso has been reported elsewhere.18 Raman spectra with both\nexcitation wavelengths give a trend similar to that found af-\nter thermal annealing.12\nLonger excitation wavelengths excite larger clusters with\nlower bandgap and lower frequency breathing modes.18 Fig-\nure 2 shows that the larger excitation wavelength shows\nlarger I\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002, therefore it indicates the presence of clus-\nters even in as deposited films. It is possible to estimate the\ncluster size based on these measurements.18 Before laser an-\nnealing, PLD a-C films seem to be ta-C \u0001Ref. 19\u0002 and sig-\na\u0002Electronic mail: y.miyajima@surrey.ac.uk.\nb\u0002Electronic mail: s.silva@surrey.ac.uk.\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 92, 152104 \u00012008\u0002\n0003-6951\/2008\/92\u000215\u0001\/152104\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics92, 152104-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The cluster size is\nestimated to be about 1 nm for as deposited a-C and laser\nannealed films with the laser energy density between\n30\u201390 mJ \/cm2. For the laser annealed sample at\n120 mJ \/cm2, the cluster size increases to around 10 nm. The\nsp2 clustering in a-C films is apparent from Raman spectra.\nElectrical characterization of the films was carried out\nusing sandwich structures. A highly doped c-Si wafer with a\ndc sputtered 100 nm thick aluminium on the back was used for the bottom contact. A circular top electrode with an area\nof 1.5\u000110\u22124 cm2 was fabricated by dc sputtering 50 nm\nthick Cr through a shadow mask. The a-C films were 80 nm\nthick. Electrical measurements were carried out using a Kei-\nthley 236 sourcemeter at room temperature.\nThe current density versus electric field \u0001J-E\u0002 character-\nistics of the films is shown in Figure 3\u0001a\u0002. The conduction\nmechanism of a-C films is different between the low and the\nhigh electric fields \u0001\u0003104 V \/cm\u0002. The J-E curves are sym-\nmetric, which implies the conduction mechanism is bulk lim-\nited, rather than contact limited since two different electrodes\n\u0001highly doped c-Si for the bottom and Cr for the top\u0002 were\nused. The most probable conduction mechanism at high\nfields is Poole\u2013Frenkel conduction via neutral trapping cen-\nters. In such a case, the log of the current density is propor-\ntional to the square root of the electric field at high fields for\nthis situation.19\nFigure 3\u0001b\u0002 shows that indeed there is a linear relation-\nship between ln J and E1\/2 at high fields. Pool\u2013Frenkel con-\nduction seems to occur in the as deposited sample and laser\nannealed sample with the laser energy density between\n30\u201360 mJ \/cm2. The samples laser annealed of 90 and\n120 mJ \/cm2 seem to be Ohmic. The reason of Ohmic con-\nduction might be the creation of filamentlike paths consisting\nof sp2 hybridization at 90 mJ \/cm2.\nThe resistivity obtained from the low electric field region\ndecreases with increasing laser energy to 90 mJ \/cm2, then\nslightly increases at 120 mJ \/cm2, as shown in Figure 3\u0001c\u0002.\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\nThe decrease of the resistivity can be attributed to the trans-\nformation from sp3 to isolated sp2 hybridization similar to\nnormal annealing since I\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002 does not change.12 How-\never, the increase of the resistivity at 120 mJ \/cm2 contradicts\nthe Raman data I\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002 since the sp2 clustering should\ndecrease the resistivity compared with 90 mJ \/cm2.\nFigure 4\u0001a\u0002 shows that the as deposited a-C films have\nsmall sp2 clusters embedded in the sp3 matrix. Figure 4\u0001b\u0002\nshows the laser annealed a-C films with the laser energy\ndensity between 30\u201390 mJ \/cm2 with an increase in the num-\nber of isolated sp2 hybridizations. Figure 4\u0001c\u0002 shows that the\nsize of the sp2 clusters has increased following annealing\nwith the laser energy density of 120 mJ \/cm2. Isolated sp2\nsites, formed during laser annealing between 30 and\n90 mJ \/cm2, are thought to be the hopping centers at low\nelectric fields and the neutral trapping centers responsible for\nconduction at high electric fields.\nA decrease of the resistivity with increasing laser energy\n\u000130\u201390 mJ \/cm2\u0002 can be explained by the increase of the\ndensity of the hopping sites \u0001sp2 clusters\u0002, but the size of the\nsp2 clusters is estimated to be small \u00011 nm\u0002 according to the\nI\u0001D\u0002 \/ I\u0001G\u0002 of Raman. The slight increase of the resistivity\nfrom 90 to 120 mJ \/cm2, could be attributed to a decrease in\nthe thickness. When sp2 clustering occurs, the volume of the\nfilms might decrease as a result of the microstructural\nchanges as has been previously observed for a-C:H.20 How-\never, in the hydrogen free a-C case, laser ablation of the film\nis thought to occur at the higher laser energy densities.\nA Digital Instruments, Dimension 3100 atomic force mi-\ncroscope \u0001AFM\u0002 was used to analyze the surface topography\nin the tapping mode. The rms roughness of the surface was\nestimated from AFM data. From the AFM analysis, it was\nestimated that the rms surface roughness was \u00040.3 nm for\nboth as deposited and laser irradiated films including those\nannealed at 120 mJ \/cm2.\nThis observation suggests that the UV-PLA process with\na laser energy density below 120 mJ \/cm2 does not modify\nthe surface roughness. The visible and infrared lasers ablate\nor spallate the surface of a-C:H films and glassy carbon\nwhen the laser energy density is of the order of sub-J \/cm2.\nThese surface were reported to be smooth.20 It is thought that\nthe 120 mJ \/cm2 laser could induce similar phenomenon on\nhydrogen free a-C films resulting in thinning of the films\nwhile retaining a smooth surface. Furthermore, the laser was\nscanned on the surface of the films, so, the bell-like crater\ndid not appear on the surface of the films after laser irradia-\ntion. Thus, homogeneous thickness reduction could occur\nsince the surface of a-C tends to be naturally smooth.1\nIn conclusion, UV-PLA was carried out on nonhydroge-\nnated a-C films. The resistivity of the films decreases with\nincreasing laser energy density, without changing the surface\nroughness. The reduction in resistivity is explained by ther-\nmally induced localized graphitization of films. The transi-\ntion from sp3 to isolated sp2 hybridization explains the re-\nduction in resistivity of the film. The improvement in the\nconductivity by PLD while maintaining the surface smooth-\nness is a useful technique for the fabricating a-C thin film\ndevices such as resonant tunneling diodes4 that require accu-\nrate thickness control of the layers with smooth surfaces.\nThe authors are grateful to the EPSRC Swindon UK for\nfunding this program via a Portfolio Partnership award.
