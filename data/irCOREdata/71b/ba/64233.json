Introduction \n \nThe populations of many European bat species are thought to have declined \nand there has been considerable concern about the potential impact of contaminants \non a range of species. This has mostly focussed on organochlorine insecticides, \npolychlorinated biphenyls and biocides used in remedial timber treatments (Clark and \nShore, 2001).  In comparison, few studies have considered the exposure and potential \nimpacts on bats of toxic heavy metals, such as mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and cadmium \n(Cd), even though these elements are readily transferred through insectivore \nfoodchains (Ma and Talmage, 2001).  Furthermore, many bat species are relatively \nlong-lived (Arlettaz et al., 2002), and some metals, for example Cd, can be \nprogressively accumulated with age (Walker et al., 2002).  Thus, insectivorous bats \nmay be at risk of accumulating high and potentially toxic tissue concentrations of \nsome non-essential metals.  \nSeveral studies have reported Pb poisoning and potential Pb-mediated effects \non reproduction in bats (Clark, 1979; Sutton and Wilson, 1983; Hariono et al., 1993).  \nSub-lethal concentrations of Cd, Pb, Hg, arsenic and essential trace elements in the \nbody organs, fur and guano of various species have also been reported but most \nstudies are from North America and Australia (Thies and Gregory, 1994; M\u00e9ndez and \nAlvarez-Casta\u00f1eda, 2000; Clark and Shore, 2001; Hickey et al., 2001; O'Shea et al., \n2001).   There have been very few reports of tissue metal concentration in bats from \nEurope, and, as far as we are aware, no published studies that report such data for bats \nfrom Britain.  Most of the European studies have focussed on just one or two species \nor have analysed relatively small numbers of individuals within species (Gerell and \nLundberg, 1993; Streit and Nagel, 1993a, b; L\u00fcftl et al. 2003), thereby making it \ndifficult to identify how toxic metal contamination varies within and between bat \nspecies.   \nIn the current study, we examined heavy metal contamination in the kidneys \nfrom bat carcasses that had been collected opportunistically over approximately 15 \nyears from the predominantly rural south-west (SW) region of Britain.  Our aim was \nto use this large sample to: (i) determine how heavy metal concentrations in bats from \nBritain vary with species, sex, and age, and whether the levels of contamination are \ntypical of those in bats from elsewhere; (ii) assess whether metal concentrations have \n 3\nchanged over time; (iii) compare the measured tissue concentrations with critical \nresidue levels associated with adverse effects in mammals.   \n  \n2. Methods \n \n2.1. Sample collection \n A total of 272 bats, consisting of eight species, found dead or fatally injured \nbetween 1988 and 2003 were collected for analysis.  All were from the counties of \nCornwall and Devon in SW England.  They were identified to species and sex, but \nwere only separated by age class (adult\/juvenile) from 2001 onwards.  Juveniles were \ndistinguished by the relative lack of ossification of their epiphyses.  The bats were \ndissected, a post-mortem examination was carried out, and the body organs were \nexcised for various studies.  The kidneys were retained for quantification of metal \ncontaminants and stored at -20\u00baC until analysed.  Livers were retained for analysis of \norganochlorine insecticides and polychlorinated biphenyls, the data for which will be \nreported elsewhere.  \n  \n2.2. Determination of Cd, Pb, and Hg in bat kidneys \nThe two kidneys in each bat were pooled so that the sample weight for \nanalysis ranged between 0.008 g and 0.186 g wet weight (ww).  Kidneys were dried \nto constant weight at 80\u00baC and solubilised in cold (Aristar grade) nitric acid (Merck \nLtd, Poole, Dorset, UK) for at least 24 hours.  Each acid digest was further solubilised \nby heating to 90 \u00b0C, adding 0.2 ml of hydrogen peroxide (to aid oxidation of lipids), \nand then heating to 120\u00b0C.  Digestion proceeded at this temperature until digests had \nstopped fuming and were straw-coloured.  Digests were then made up to fixed \nvolume (typically 5 ml and always 20% acid).   \nSub-samples of the digest were diluted with de-ionised water so that the \nanalyte was within the calibration range and the final acid content was 10%.  Hg was \ndetermined by cold vapour atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Solaar 969, \nThermoUnicam, Cambridge, UK) using 10% tin chloride in 20% sulphuric acid as a \nreducing agent, nitrogen as a carrier gas, and an absorbance wavelength of 253.7 nm, \nas described by L\u00f3pez  Alonso et al. (2003).  Lead and cadmium concentrations were \ndetermined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometery using a Varian \n 4\nSpectrAA 300 spectrophotometer and GTA-96 graphite furnace.  A matrix modifier \nconsisting of palladium, ammonium dihydrogenphosphate, magnesium nitrate and \ncitric acid in a 1% HCl solution (Milton et al., 1998) was added to all standards and \nsamples to allow the atomisation of the analyte at high temperature and to remove \nbackground interferences. The relative proportions of the different constituents in the \nmodifier and the thermal programme used for the furnace were optimised separately \nfor each metal. Certified reference materials of an appropriate matrix type and that \nhad detectable Cd, Hg and Pb concentrations in sample masses equivalent to that of \nbat kidneys were not available.  Analytical recoveries were therefore determined from \nspiked kidney samples and the mean (\u00b1SE) recovery was 101 \u00b1 3.12 % (n=23) for \nHg, 112 \u00b1 5.22% (n=23) for Pb and 96.2 \u00b1 4.01% (n=22) for Cd.  \nFor all metals, the limit of detection (LoD) for the total amount of metal in the \ndigest was calculated as three times the standard deviation of the mean blank value.  \nThere was minor variation in LoD between analytical batches and so the maximum \nbatch LoD recorded was applied to all the samples.  The LoD for the concentration in \nthe kidney was derived by dividing the digest LoD by the mean kidney weight.  \nBecause kidney mass varies with body size and there were large size differences \namong the bat species analysed, the LoD for the kidney concentration varied some \nthree- to four-fold among species.  To eliminate biases in the statistical analyses, the \nLoD used for the smallest species was applied to all other species, which was 1.86 \n\u00b5g\/g dry weight (dw) for Hg, 1.24 \u00b5g\/g dw for Pb, and 0.162 \u00b5g\/g dw for Cd.   \n \n2.3. Data  analysis \nRenal metal concentrations are presented on a dry weight basis. For statistical \npurposes, non-detected concentrations were assigned a value of half the limit of \ndetection.  Kidney metal concentrations were not usually normally distributed or \nvariances among groups were not always homogenous.  Differences among bat \nspecies were therefore determined by non-parametric analysis of variance (Kruskall-\nWallis tests) and Dunn\u2019s post-hoc multiple comparison test; P<0.05 was taken as \nstatistically significant in post-hoc tests.  Because non-parametric approaches were \nused, summary statistics are given as medians and inter-quartile ranges.   \nAnalysis of the variation in kidney metal concentrations with age and sex \nwere usually conducted by analysis of variance using a general linear model (GLM: \nMinitab version 14.1, Minitab Inc., USA).  In some instances, it was necessary to \n 5\ntransform the data to ranks prior to analysis to ensure that the underlying assumptions \nof the model were met.  Sex and age were usually entered as factors in the model and \nyear of collection as a covariate. Associations between different renal metal \nconcentrations and between kidney residues and body weight were determined using \nSpearman rank correlation coefficients.  The analyses were restricted to bats with \ndetectable residues only, as inclusion of animals with non-detected values can result \nin spurious correlations.  Because of the relatively high proportion of non-detected \nrenal metal concentrations in some species, temporal trends in contamination were \ndetermined in two ways.  First, changes over time in the proportion of animals with \ndetectable residues were analysed by binary logistic regression. Second, changes in \nthe annual median renal concentrations of bats with detectable residues were assessed \nusing backwards stepwise linear regression in which data from each year were \nweighted by the sample size for that year; year and sex were both used as terms in the \nmodel.   \n \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1 Kidney Hg, Cd and Pb concentrations in different species \nFour species comprised 96% of the bats analysed. Most (63%) were \npipistrelles (Pipistrellus spp), which were not separated into the recently recognised \nseparate cryptic species of P.  pipistrellus or P. pygmaeus (International Commission \non Zoological Nomenclature, 2003).  Brown long-eared (Plecotus auritus), whiskered \n(Myotis mystacinus) and Natterer\u2019s bats (Myotis nattereri) made up an additional \n22%, 6% and 5% of the sample, respectively.   \n   There were differences among species in their kidney metal concentrations \n(Table 1).  Whiskered and Natterer\u2019s bats had the highest median renal Hg \nconcentrations, and pipistrelles had significantly lower concentrations than any of the \nother three species.  In contrast, kidney Pb concentrations did not vary significantly \namong pipistrelles, brown-long eared or whiskered bats but were significantly higher \nin these species than in Natterer\u2019s bats.  Kidney Cd concentrations also varied \nsignificantly among species.  Natterer\u2019s bats had the highest average renal \nconcentration and the median concentration for brown long-eared bats was 1.5-7 fold \n 6\nlower than for the other species (Table 1).  However, differences in kidney Cd \nbetween individual species were not statistically significant in post-hoc tests.   \nThe kidneys from four barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus), four lesser \nhorseshoe (Rhinolophus hipposideros), three noctule (Nyctalus noctula) and one \nserotine (Eptesicus serotinus) bat were also analysed but, because of the limited \nsample sizes, the residue data were not included in any statistical tests. Median \nconcentrations above the LoD were only detected for Hg in lesser horseshoes \n(1.62 \u00b5g\/g dw) and for Pb in barbastelle bats (2.17  \u00b5g\/g dw).  Median kidney Cd \nconcentrations exceeded the LoD in all four species and ranged between 0.28 and \n2.13 \u00b5g\/g dw.  \n \n3.2. Variation in kidney residues in pipistrelle and brown long-eared bats  \nThe effects of age, sex and time on renal metal concentrations were determined \nonly for pipistrelle and long-eared bats as they were the only species for which \nsample sizes were sufficiently robust.  Potential age and sex related effects were \nexamined first using the subset of data (bats collected between 2001 and 2003) for \nwhich age data were available; age class and sex were factors in the GLM and year of \ncollection was a covariate.   In brown long-eared bats, there was no significant effect \nof age, sex or year on renal concentrations of any of the three metals; however, the \nnumber of bats analysed was relatively small.  In pipistrelle bats, adults had \nsignificantly higher kidney Cd concentrations than juveniles (F1,39 = 9.51, P<0.005) \nbut kidney Cd did not vary with sex or year (Figure 1).  Renal Pb concentrations did \nnot vary significantly with age, sex or year.  Age likewise did not significantly affect \nrenal Hg concentrations in pipistrelles.  Mercury was not detected in any adult or \njuvenile females and, among males, there was also a high proportion (69%) of non-\ndetected concentrations and no significant effect of age.   \nWhen changes in renal metal concentrations over time were examined, there \nwere no significant progressive changes in the proportion of brown long-eared bats \nwith detectable Cd, Pb, or kidney Hg residues (Figure 2).  Median kidney Hg, Cd and \nPb concentrations in individuals with detectable residues likewise did not vary \nsignificantly over time (Figure 2), nor did they vary significantly between males and \nfemales.  In pipistrelles (Figure 3), median renal Hg concentrations in bats with \ndetectable concentrations did increase significantly over time (F1,10 = 6.05, P=0.034); \nthere was no significant difference between males and females, nor any change in the \n 7\nproportion of bats with detectable Hg residues (Figure 3).  Although the proportion of \npipistrelle bats with detectable Pb concentrations appeared to decline over time \n(Figure 3), this was not statistically significant (G(1) = 0.613, P = 0.434).  Similarly, \nthere was no significant change over time in the proportion of bats with detectable \nkidney Cd residues or in annual median renal concentrations of Pb or Cd in bats with \ndetected residues.  Detectable kidney Pb concentrations did not vary with sex either, \nbut median renal Cd concentrations were slightly, but significantly, higher in females \nthan males (2.10 vs 1.72 \u00b5g\/g dw,  F1,18 = 5.80 , P = 0.027).  This was unexpected as \nthere was no sex effect on kidney Cd in the pipistrelles of known age class collected \nbetween 2001 and 2003.  This apparent sex difference in pipistrelles may have been \nan artefact that could have arisen if there was a difference in the age structure of the \nmales and females in the sample.  \n \n3.3 Associations among kidney metal concentrations and body weight in pipistrelle \nand brown long-eared bats  \nRelationships between kidney concentrations of different metals and between \nrenal metal concentrations and body weight were examined to determine if there was \nevidence of co-exposure and of potential adverse effects, respectively.  There was a \nsignificant positive relationship between kidney Cd and Pb residues in pipistrelle bats \n(Table 2, Figure 4) and a similar relationship in brown-long-eared bats, although the \nsample size was smaller and the trend was not statistically significant (Table 2).  \nThere was no significant relationship between renal Hg and Pb or between Hg and Cd \nin either bat species (Table 2).  When body weight was related to kidney metal \nconcentrations, (Table 3), there was a significant negative relationship for Hg in \npipistrelles (Table 3, Figure 5).  However, a similar relationship was not detected in \nbrown long-eared bats (Table 3, Figure 5).  There were no other significant \nrelationships between kidney metal concentrations and body weight (Table 3).    \n \n \n4. Discussion \n \nBoth average and maximum kidney Hg, Cd and Pb concentrations in the bats \nfrom SW England were similar to those in the same and other species collected over \nthe same time period in Austria (L\u00fcftl et al., 2003) and Germany (Streit and Nagel, \n 8\n1993a, b), and were approximately two-three times higher than reported in the scant \ndata available for kidney concentrations of metals in other bat species from outside \nEurope (Miura et al., 1978; Clark et al., 1986).  Thus, metal contamination in bats \nfrom this rural region of Britain appears to be similar to that found in bats elsewhere \nin Europe.  However, pipistrelle bats from close to an industrial area in Sweden had \nhigher renal metal concentrations than individuals from a remote area (Gerell and \nLundberg, 1993).  Thus, it is possible that contamination in bats in SW England may \nbe lower than in individuals from more industrialised areas of Britain.  \n Our results demonstrated that there was significant variation in kidney metal \nconcentrations among pipistrelle, brown long-eared, whiskered and Natterer\u2019s bats \ncollected from the same region. Average renal metal concentrations were generally \nhighest in whiskered bats.  L\u00fcftl et al. (2003) also observed that whiskered bats in \nAustria tended to accumulate higher renal toxic metal concentrations than other \nspecies, and suggested this was because they are relatively long lived.  However, \nrenal Hg and Pb concentrations have not been found to increase with age in various \nother terrestrial mammals (Massie et al., 1993; Shore and Rattner, 2001; L\u00f3pez \nAlonso et al., 2003) and we found no evidence of renal accumulation of Pb and Hg \nwith age in bats from SW England.  High accumulation of toxic metals by whiskered \nbats compared with other species is more likely to reflect differences in dietary \nexposure, although it may also result from inter-species variation in assimilation.  The \nlow accumulation of mercury by pipistrelles from Devon and Cornwall (Table 1) \nmost probably reflected low levels of exposure, as pipistrelles do not seem to be \nintrinsically poor accumulators of Hg; renal Hg concentrations in pipistrelles from \nAustria were similar to those in other bat species (L\u00fcftl et al., 2003).  It seems likely \nthat transfer rates (and possibly pathways) differ not only between bat species but \nalso between toxicants, otherwise pipistrelles in the current study would have been \nexpected to accumulate low kidney residues of Pb and Cd as well as Hg, but this was \nnot the case. \nAccumulation of renal metal residues has been found to vary with age and sex \nin bats, but not consistently across species (Gerell and Lundberg, 1993; L\u00fcftl et al., \n2003; this study), other than kidney Cd is accumulated with age as also reported in \nother mammals (Shore and Rattner, 2001).  We observed that kidney Cd was \naccumulated with age in pipistrelles in our study, but renal Pb and Hg concentrations \ndid not vary with age class, and kidney Pb, Hg and Cd residues did not vary with sex.  \n 9\nThere was also no evidence that Pb or Cd residues varied significantly over time. The \nlack of any statistically significant detectable decline in kidney Pb in pipistrelle or \nbrown long-eared bats contrasts with the marked decline over the same time period in \nPb petrol emissions and atmospheric Pb (Environment Agency, 2006).  Our results \nsuggest that reductions in petrol Pb emissions have not significantly affected the \nbioavailability of Pb to bats in this region of Britain.  However, it may be expected \nthat declines in Pb contamination in terrestrial and aquatic food chains would lag \nbehind declines in atmospheric Pb levels.  \nThe positive relationship between kidney Pb and Cd residues in bats in the \npresent study suggests individuals exposed to higher levels of Pb are likewise \nexposed to relatively high amounts of Cd.  In contrast, the lack of a significant \nrelationship between renal Hg concentrations and either kidney Pb or Cd suggests that \nhabitat contamination and\/or transfer pathways for Hg differ from those for Cd and \nPb.  Furthermore, unlike Cd and Pb, kidney Hg concentrations increased significantly \nbetween 1988 and 2003 in pipistrelles.  This suggests that exposure to bioavailable \nHg increased during this period and may reflect increased diffuse atmospheric inputs \nof mercury and\/or increased exposure to point sources.  No significant time trend for \nHg was observed in brown long-eared bats but annual and total sample sizes were \nsmaller.  As far as we are aware, there are no other time-trend data for Hg in bats in \nBritain or elsewhere, nor for insectivorous mammals or birds in Britain, and so it is \nimpossible to assess whether the trend in pipistrelles is typical for other bat species or \nother insectivores in Britain or elsewhere.   \nHeavy metal renal concentrations in the bats from SW England were generally \nlower than those associated with adverse effects in mammals. The maximum kidney \nresidues measured in this study did not exceed the critical concentrations of 20-30 \n\u03bcg\/g ww (approximately 70-100 \u03bcg\/g dw) for Hg (Thompson, 1996) and 105 \u03bcg\/g \ndw for Cd (Chmielnicka et al., 1989) that are associated with adverse effects, while \nmedian concentrations were more than an order of magnitude lower.  Mercury and \nCd-mediated adverse clinical effects in bats in SW England would not therefore be \nexpected.  We found a negative relationship between renal Hg concentration and \nbody weight in pipistrelles but this is not necessarily evidence of a direct adverse \neffect.  For example, such a relationship could arise simply from differences in the \nprey (and its associated level of contamination) taken by individuals of different size.  \n 10\nHowever, further investigation of the health status of contaminated pipistrelles is \nwarranted, especially given that accumulation of mercury by pipistrelles in SW \nEngland appears to be rising.  As with Hg and Cd, median renal Pb concentrations \nwere 6-20-fold lower than the 25 \u03bcg\/g dw suggested as diagnostic of acute lead \npoisoning in mammalian wildlife (Ma, 1996).  However, approximately 5% of \npipistrelles had renal Pb residues that exceeded this concentration.  Some of these \nindividuals may have suffered lead-induced effects.  Ideally, we would have \nsupported our chemical analysis with histolopathological examinations of the kidneys \nto determine whether there were lesions consistent with or suggestive of Pb poisoning \nin the bats with high Pb residues.  However, the kidneys were too small for both \nhistological and chemical contaminant analysis and, in many cases, the bats were too \nautolysed for histopathological examination.    \n \n5. Conclusion \n \nThis study is the first evaluation of toxic heavy metal concentrations in bats in \nBritain.  Our results suggest that accumulation of Pb, Cd and Hg in individuals from \nthe south-west is similar to that measured in bats from elsewhere in Europe and is \nmostly well below that associated with adverse clinical effects in other orders of wild \nmammals.  However, little is known about the interactions between metal \ncontamination in bats and other stressors such as disease.  Furthermore, there is no \nevidence that accumulation of toxic metals by bats has declined over the last 15-20 \nyears and, to the contrary, accumulation of Hg by pipistrelles appears to be increasing.   \nContinued monitoring of the long-term trends in metal accumulation and associated \nhealth status in bats, together with exploration of the extent to which contamination \nmay be greater in individuals from more industrialised regions, is merited.   \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe are indebted to Ginni Little, Rowena Varley and the Cornwall Bat Group for \ncollecting the bat carcasses.  \n \n 11\n References \n \nArlettaz, R., Christe, P., Desfayes, M., 2002. 33 years, a new longevity record for a \nEuropean bat.
