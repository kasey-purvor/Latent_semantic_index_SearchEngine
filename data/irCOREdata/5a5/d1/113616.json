Recent government\ninvestments aim to ameliorate widely criticised services for adolescence, and redress the\nnegative images of young people. In order to explore the current state of knowledge\nregarding adolescent mental health, and relate this knowledge to practice, this paper\nexplores three key questions: are adolescent mental health problems increasing, are\nadolescents dislocated by new and different contexts, and what are the levels of mental\nhealth difficulties in adolescence? The paper suggests that evidence that adolescents are\n\u2018getting worse\u2019 is not convincing, but it is clear that the contexts for adolescence have\nchanged radically and this affects adolescent developmental processes. Adolescent mental\nhealth difficulties require a current, developmentally relevant and oriented approach to\nenhance effective understanding and intervention. Adults in general and professionals in\nparticular need to be able to engage with and not take flight from the impact of adolescent\nemotionality.\nKeywords adolescent mental health; puberty; transition to adulthood;\nsuicidality; self-harm; depression; conduct problems\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, the problems of adolescence have been broadcast in a particularly\ninsistent way. Adolescent mental health difficulties \u2014 including anxiety and\ndepression, \u2018conduct\u2019 problems including individual and group \u2014 or gang \u2014\nviolence, alcohol and drug misuse, eating disorders, and so on \u2014 insist on being\nheard. Two particular aspects of this discourse can be recognised; firstly, there is the\nnotion that adolescents \u2018are awful\u2019, which appears in undiluted form in tabloids, and is\nechoed ironically in the \u2018broadsheets\u2019:\nJournal of Social Work Practice Vol. 23, No. 1, March 2009, pp. 49\u201364\nISSN 0265-0533 print\/ISSN 1465-3885 online \u0001 2009 GAPS\nhttp:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals DOI: 10.1080\/02650530902723316\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nYou only ever hear a nice thing about a teenager from a charity worker.\nOtherwise, parents, teachers, the police, the criminal justice system, all are\nunited, just for this instance: adolescents are awful.\n(Zoe Williams, The Guardian, Wednesday, 1 October 2008)\nThe second aspect is that a minority is giving the majority a bad name. This is now\nthe official position in UK social policy:\nThere is an unrelentingly negative view of young people in this country, where\nthe problems of the few eclipse the achievements of the many \u2026 With this\nstrategy we are determined to rebalance the public debate about our young\npeople.\n(Beverley Hughes1)\nThe increased emphasis on participation and access to services underpins the\nGovernment\u2019s \u2018Aiming High\u2019 initiative (DCSF, 2007), which aims to redress\nthe \u2018unrelenting\u2019 negative images of young people.2 This overlaps with the\nCAMHS agenda to develop comprehensive services for children and young\npeople, in which recognition and assessment of mental health is central. The\nCAMHS review (DCSF, 2008) suggests a \u2018bleak\u2019 picture for mental health\nservices offset by some more positive features; among the bleak features is the\nevidence\nthat children and young people say that services are not as well known, accessible,\nresponsive or child-centred as they should be. Those who access specialist services\ndo not always have the opportunity to develop trusting relationships with staff for\nthe length of time they need.\n(DCSF, 2008, p. 9)\nThus there are trends towards attempting to make services more accessible and\nresponsive to the needs of young people, to reduce problems such as:\nAdministrative and legal processes, unhelpful thresholds for access to services and\nsome entrenched professional views can \u2018parcel up\u2019 children into individual\nservices and prevent their needs being met in a holistic, flexible and responsive\nway or leave their needs unaddressed.\n(DCSF, 2008, p. 9)\nAs investment in these services aims to reduce the reported world-wide\ncrisis in adolescent mental health services (Patel et al., 2007), it is important to\nassess whether these approaches are likely to be effective. This means looking\nclosely at the current state of knowledge regarding adolescent mental health\nand relating this knowledge to practice issues faced by professionals working\nwith young people with mental health difficulties. To explore these issues, I\nwill discuss sequentially three key, and to some extent interrelated questions,\nnamely:\n5 0 J O U R N A L O F S O C I A L W O R K P R A C T I C E\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \n1. Are adolescent mental health problems increasing?\n2. Are adolescents dislocated by new and different contexts (particularly in the\nextended phase of transition to adulthood?\n3. What are the levels of mental health difficulties in adolescence?\nAre adolescent mental health problems increasing?\nThe media led discourse on the theme that adolescents are \u2018getting worse\u2019 and\nadolescent mental health is deteriorating, draws on some findings from research which\nare cited in support of this premise. There are some high profile studies that do show\nincreasing mental health problems. For example, the Time Trends study in the Institute\nof Psychiatry\/Nuffield Foundation reports increasing conduct problems, including\naggression, fighting, stealing, in three successive cohorts born in 1958, 1970 and 1983\/\n4 (Collishaw et al., 2004). Fombonne\u2019s (1995) study shows rates for depression\nincreasing up to the time of this study. On the other hand, other studies do not support\nthis position. For example, a meta analysis of 26 studies shows no evidence for increase\nin depression over the past 30 years (Costello et al., 2006). Patel et al. (2007)\nsummarise evidence across a number of studies to conclude that \u2018evidence is mixed for\nwhether rates of mental disorders in young people have increased in the last few\ndecades\u2019 (p. 1303). Methodological questions have been raised about studies that claim\nhigher rates of problem in recent times, in that they rely on data from parents\u2019 reports\nor subsequent recall data, both of which may be, to an extent, unreliable. Taking a\ndifferent perspective, Graham (2004) emphasises that the majority of young people do\nnot have problems, report good relationships with parents and being happy. This\naccords, to a degree, with the ministerial position, quoted above, that the problems\npresented to society by adolescents are restricted to the actions of a minority.\nSuicide rates amongst young people have been of particular concern but, again,\nthe evidence is \u2018quite mixed\u2019 (Patel et al., 2007). Amongst young people, self-harm\nand suicide attempts is higher amongst girls (ratio 5:1) and completed suicide higher\namongst boys. Biddle et al. (2008) found that whilst the suicide rate for females has\nremained constant, \u2018since the 1990s, rates of suicide in young men have declined\nsteadily and by 2005 they were at their lowest level for almost 30 years\u2019. The rate for\nyoung men fell from 16 per 100,000 in 1998 to 9 per 100,000 in 2005. This finding is\nechoed by the annual report of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (NIMHE,\n2008) which finds that the suicide rate for young men is falling:\nThere has continued to be an encouraging and sustained fall in the rate of suicide\namongst young men under the age of 35. However, the death rate from suicide\namongst this high-risk group is still high in comparison with the general\npopulation. That is why it is still important for services to develop more effective\napproaches to engage with young men.\n(p. 4)\nOverall, we have to conclude that the evidence for adolescents getting worse is\nequivocal; the \u2018jury is out\u2019. Further evidence may tilt the balance; meanwhile we need\nR I S K S A N D O P P O R T U N I T I E S I N A D O L E S C E N C E 5 1\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nto find other ways of understanding this discussion. The negative view of adolescents has\nthe feel of what Stan Cohen (2002) called \u2018Folk Devils and Moral Panics\u2019. From this\nperspective, discourses about young people surface the threats that they are felt to pose to\nsociety\u2019s moral decline; thus the issue is not whether the \u2018problem\u2019 exists, but \u2018how it\nbecomes inflated, stereotyped, to the point of moral panic\u2019 (Sharland, 2006, p. 3). Recent\ncoverage of adolescent issues has generated a vast range of folk devils; the moral panic is\nfocused on the discourse that adolescents are \u2018getting worse\u2019. This shifts the emphasis\nfrom a focus on the behaviour of adolescents to an interactional perspective; two parties\nare involved in setting the agenda and distorting the issues. Thus adolescents are invested\nwith societal and adult attitudes and expectations, in a sense, these are projected on to\nadolescents, meeting societal (or adult) needs. Cohen pointed out that there is a\npropensity for \u2018single solutions\u2019 to moral panics. True to form, accounts in the media\nfocus on single causes, and there has been generated a long list of single causes: stress,\neducational pressure, too many temptations (drugs, alcohol, firearms, the Internet,\naffluence, consumption opportunities), breakdown of family values and structures, and so\non; this is the process through which negative images of adolescence are generated and\nwhich distorts interactions between adults and adolescents. A consequence is that as well\nas critical attitudes towards adolescents, within the moral panic, there is also a social fear\nof adolescents, and thus of the emotionality which is quintessentially adolescent.\nFear of adolescent emotionality\nTo illustrate the impact of fear of adolescent emotionality, I will discuss an example,\ntaken from some work in a secondary school (Briggs & Buhagiar, 2008). The school\nhad asked us to help establish policies and practices for preventing suicide and self-\nharm. They told us that the issue of self-harm made staff anxious and they would\nappreciate help in dealing with this.\nOur preferred method of work in these circumstances is to establish groups in\nwhich the staff can discuss their experiences with individual students and class groups\nin order to help the staff contain the emotional experiences of working with\nindividuals and groups of adolescents. Rustin and Bradley (2008) describe this model\nof \u2018work discussion\u2019; developed initially for clinical settings, the model has now been\nwidely applied with beneficial effects. In their evaluation of the application of \u2018work\ndiscussion\u2019 in educational settings, Andrea Warman and Emil Jackson (2006) found\nthat as well as experiencing benefits in their work, teachers using the work discussion\ngroups had lower rates of absence through sickness. The process, in the work\ndiscussion group method, of exploring the emotional impact of the work, and\nattending to meaning, appears to support the worker and reduce the risk of \u2018infection\u2019\n\u2014 enabling the worker to be able to be more \u2018affected\u2019 by emotional experiences,\nwithout becoming \u2018infected\u2019 (Heyno, 2008).\nHowever, in this school our suggestions that we establish such groups were not\naccepted; the staff were too busy and could not commit themselves, we were told.\nTherefore we agreed instead to undertake some focus groups with staff, parents and\nstudents to provide a report on how these key groups thought about (and positioned\nthemselves) in relation to self-harm.\n5 2 J O U R N A L O F S O C I A L W O R K P R A C T I C E\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nOur findings were interesting, but problematic. We encountered a pervading fear\nof talking about self-harm. The widespread idea was that \u2018If you talk about self-harm\nyou make it worse or you make it happen\u2019. Staff, students and the members of the\nresearch ethics committee (which included members who were parents at the school)\nall participated in this belief. The Ethics Committee only agreed our application \u2018on\nthe express understanding that you will not ask school pupils any questions of a\npersonal nature\u2019. There was a pervasive fear of contagion \u2014 talking leads to\ndestructive action.\nStaff in focus groups oscillated between saying, firstly, that there was no self-harm\nor suicidal behaviour in the school and, secondly, that they urgently needed experts to\ncome in and work with suicidal students because they felt hopelessly unable to deal\nwith it themselves. Thus we came to the view that staff were anxious and helpless\nwith regard to understanding self-harm because a number of different pressures in the\nsystem disabled them from relating to students in ways that would enable\nunderstanding of the students, and this heightened anxiety about adolescents, who,\nit was felt could not be understood. These pressures included, firstly, tensions\nbetween academic achievement and pastoral care which led to staff being unsure about\ntheir roles and what was expected and how to maintain appropriate boundaries.\nSecondly, alongside this, the school had the aim of changing its academic profile to\nimprove its Ofsted and league table position. This had the effect of generating a\nculture in which the aim was to evacuate (rather than address) emotional problems\nexperienced by the students.\nWe met with two groups of students who also indicated fear of contagion and a\nfear of talking about difficulties:\nBut, sir, it\u2019s not that good to talk about it because it might influence other people\nto have a go as well, because they\u2019ll think that if so and so can get their anger out\nby doing this behaviour, maybe it will work with me.\nA small majority of students in our groups (17\/31) thought that if someone is\nself-harming, talking to them about it will only make it worse. Most students felt it\ninadvisable to talk to teachers or peers; only 4\/31 felt talking to teachers could be\nhelpful, and, perhaps more surprising, only 6\/31 recommended confiding in a peer.\nI emphasise that I am not suggesting this example is typical or representative of\nschools; in fact what was striking to us was that the local \u2018culture\u2019 (habitus) was a\npowerful factor in determining the qualities of experience and relatedness. However,\nit does provide an example where the breakdown of communication between adults\nand adolescents reveals lack of trust, a lack of belief about the capacity to make\nexperiences better through communicating, relating and understanding, and an\nabsence of reflective spaces that enable emotions to be faced thoughtfully.\nFear of adolescent emotionality may be thought of, more generally, as\nconstituting an important aspect in the creation of folk devils and moral panics.\nAdults find adolescent emotionality disturbing, because it is. When in contact with\nyoung people we can be subject to strong feelings, flowing from the post-pubertal\ndrives and impulses in the adolescent process: it is what Hyatt Williams (1978) called\nthe tensions between the creativity that flows \u2018when the tide of life is running\nR I S K S A N D O P P O R T U N I T I E S I N A D O L E S C E N C E 5 3\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nstrongly\u2019 and its counter part of a destructive kind, that makes for the intensity of\nadolescence. And, stirred up by these, we feel maybe provoked or disturbed:\nSometimes it feels as though all the unwanted feelings, hopelessness,\nincompetence, and fear on the one hand, and responsibility and worry without\nthe power to go with it on the other, are left with the parents.\n(Anderson, 1999, p. 166)\nAnderson added, poignantly, that parenting adolescents, like parenting a baby,\ninevitably leaves a scar \u2014 we can\u2019t do it without feeling marked and changed in some\nway; the commitment in terms of emotional labour required is therefore\nconsiderable.\nBrenman Pick (1988), discussing the emotional impact of work with adolescents\nin an analytic setting, focused on the intensity of the forces which are mobilised in the\nadolescent, and their impact on the worker. In adolescence, \u2018the power of the force\nby which the post-pubertal adolescent feels carried along by the impulses and defences\nhe (sic) constructs against them\u2019 and in turn the adolescent has the potential to have\nthis effect on the therapist. This leads to the adolescent trying to \u2018sweep the parents\nalong with him, or angrily turn away and be swept along by the adolescent group\u2019\n(p. 188). The therapist may be \u2018swept away\u2019 into \u2018colluding with his ideology or\ntrying to sweep him (sic) away with a rival ideology\u2019 (p. 188). Brenman Pick\ncompares two adolescents in analysis. The cases complement each other, for whilst\n\u2018John was carried away by the adolescent culture, Jane had the power to carry adults\naway with her through a seductive superiority which aroused adults\u2019 envy\u2019 (p. 189).\nJohn got \u2018drunk not only with alcohol and drugs but with his power to act out and\nhave a good time\u2019; Jane got the therapist \u2018drunk\u2019 on her seductiveness, and through\nprojecting her sense of her superiority.\nThus both individual adults, in parental or professional roles, and organisations\nmay develop a \u2018culture\u2019 which coheres around an adolescent ideology (drunk on\nadolescence). These defensive cultures can include impulsiveness, rather than strategic\nthinking, individualisation of methods of work, relying on charismatic leaders, having\ngrandiose or manic overestimation of the work. These defences may indicate that the\norganisation is vulnerable to the power of the forces of adolescence and become swept\naway with this power. Alternatively, the culture may cohere around an ideology\nwhich is an alternative to that of the adolescents. Defences then have the aim of\nprotecting the therapist from the fear of adolescent pain, especially the painfulness of\nchange and separation. These defences aim to control the upsurge of adolescence. The\ndenied, rationalised or \u2018forgotten\u2019 pains and abjection of aspects of our own\nadolescence (Jacobs, 1990) is felt to be threatening and to stir up fears of losing\ncontrol of a more rational and balanced approach. Boundaries separating adolescents\nand adults in these circumstances are usually strictly maintained, so that the pain of\nadolescence is not felt consciously by the adults.\nIn current service provision the fear of adolescent emotionality can be seen in a\nsplit between, on the one hand, the emphasis on participation and engagement in the\nvoluntary sector, and, on the other hand, prioritisation of severity of difficulties,\ndisturbance, diagnoses and risk assessment in the statutory sector. This split between\n5 4 J O U R N A L O F S O C I A L W O R K P R A C T I C E\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \n\u2018the street and the clinic\u2019 pervades policy and reflects the absence of a containing\nintegration of both the rational and the intensely emotional (and often irrational)\naspects of adolescence.\nHow do changing contexts affect adolescent mental health?\nAlthough there is equivocal evidence that adolescent mental health is getting worse,\nthere is strong evidence, on the other hand, that changes in the context for adolescent\ndevelopment, particularly the transition to adulthood, have been extensive and have\nfar reaching effects. These are understood to have been driven by powerful\nsocioeconomic forces, restructuring the routes into employment for young people,\nincreasing the participation in education (including tertiary); new patterns of\nconsumption, and powerful new methods of communication, particularly the\nInternet, which hosts a virtual world of information, contacts and \u2014 through\nMySpace and FaceBook etc. \u2014 new patterns of friendships.\nThe changing contexts are also deeply divisive for adolescents who have unequal\nopportunities in the transition to adulthood. Two distinct pathways, reflecting\nincreasing inequalities, lead to two identifiable \u2018routes\u2019 into adulthood. A majority\ntake a \u2018slow track\u2019 (Jones, 2006) route to adulthood, characterised by crossing and re-\ncrossing boundaries in a series of partial transitions. Sustained parental support is\nnecessary for these repeated, partial oscillations between dependence and semi-\nindependence. \u2018Slow track routes\u2019 are characterised by individualised decision\nmaking, in which educational attainment plays a central role. Those lacking social and\ncultural capital are likely to make a \u2018fast track\u2019 transition \u2014 with negative\nconsequences. It is increasingly evidenced that adolescents who take a \u2018fast track\u2019\nroute into adulthood are much more likely to be disadvantaged and at risk of social\nexclusion (Jones, 2006). Adolescent development is much more governed by which\nside of the tracks you are on. The defining issue is the distribution of economic, social\nand cultural capital. The fortunate \u2014 on their \u2018slow track\u2019 route \u2014 depend on\nparental support (especially financial) until social and cultural capital is acquired\nthrough educational attainments. The costs include being stuck in semi-independence\nlate into the third decade, and needing to find ways of contending with the risks that\nare faced. Anxiety and frustrations can be high.\nGluckman and Hanson (2006) use a schematic approach to show that, whilst the\ntiming of puberty has remained constant throughout human history, the modern\nperiod, since the mid-twentieth century, is unique in separating, in time, two aspects\nof adolescence; biological (developing mature reproductive capacity) and psycholo-\ngical transitions (taking up \u2018adult roles\u2019). Though Gluckman and Hanson \u2014 and\nGraham (2004) \u2014 lament this \u2018mismatch\u2019, it can be argued that the sequential\narrangement facilitates development in contemporary social contexts through offering\ntime to \u2018work through\u2019 the experiences of puberty with social experiences, with trial\nand error.\nChange in the extent and the quality of the transition to adulthood has radically\nimpacted on adolescents and adults. There has been a struggle to realise the extent of\nthe impact, that for many, adolescence continues into what used to be \u2018early\nR I S K S A N D O P P O R T U N I T I E S I N A D O L E S C E N C E 5 5\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nadulthood\u2019. In the fast track route the risks of exclusion and marginalisation have\nappropriately become the focus of policies and practices aiming to increase\nparticipation and inclusion. During the \u2018first phase\u2019 of modern adolescence a theory\nwas developed that seemed to \u2018fit\u2019. Adolescence was a time for identity formation,\nending with the capacity to make decisions that led to commitments for life \u2014 in\nwork and in relationships. In contrast today, the process of developing identity\nrequires a different kind of adaptation, in which the key characteristics are decision-\nmaking capacity and the ability to live with uncertainty and manage piecemeal and\noften reversed changes into independence. Theorisation of this new kind of identity\ndevelopment has inevitably lagged behind experience. Now, we are beginning to\nmatch the conceptualisations with the practice, through the idea of a more fluid kind\nof identity, an elusive kind of subjectivity, gained through a sense of knowing about\nboth the internal and social forces that act upon the individual during adolescent\ndevelopment (Briggs, 2008). Kennedy (2000) usefully contrasts a state of \u2018being\nsubject to\u2019 internal, interpersonal and social forces with being the \u2018subject of\u2019 these.\nIn this latter state there is some ownership of body, drives and thoughts, and a making\nsense of experience (Ladame, 2008).\nWe can see emerging elusive subjectivity in the clinical setting, where young\npeople in difficulties illustrate the internal and social aspects of their struggles in the\ncontext of relating to a therapist. A brief anecdote illustrates this: I heard a dream\npresented to her therapist by a 16-year-old who had been taking a precocious route\nthrough adolescence \u2014 in this dream, she said she was queuing up for a club with her\nfriends when she realised she couldn\u2019t go in as she had no make-up on. She ran home\nto get her make-up but didn\u2019t have enough time, and it all went wrong trying to get\nhome. The dream then had the sense of a journey that got longer the further she\ntravelled.\nI think this rather beautifully \u2014 and simply \u2014 encapsulates an emotional\npredicament. Make-up signifies having the equipment to join the \u2018grown up\u2019 going-\nout peer group, and it may have the quality of being \u2018grown-up\u2019 or covering up. To\nget what she needs she has to go back to her childhood home; that is, she experiences\ndependence on her parents, and recognises the childhood home as the place to get\nwhat she needs to be able to be more independent. The anxiety expressed in the\ndream is that she is too far away to get back, and she feels stuck between the world\n\u2018outside\u2019 and the family home. This is a \u2018playful\u2019 communication expressed in a\nsymbolic form and told to another.\nGluckman and Hanson (2006) show the striking consistency of the timing of the\npubertal transition over time and this foregrounds the link between the two aspects of\nadolescence, an essential link that is often broken in the way that services are\nconstructed and delivered; adolescence is often split between services, either at 18,\nexcluding essential aspects in \u2018slow track\u2019 transitions, or at 16, which splits off the\npubertal phase. Psychoanalytic theories of adolescence capture the immense\nturbulence of the early adolescent period. Melanie Klein (1922) wrote of the \u2018great\nuprush of feelings\u2019, the flooding forward of new intensities of feeling which puts the\nchild\/adolescent out of balance. Time is \u2018out of joint\u2019. One 13-year-old I saw for\npsychotherapy said that though he was growing, it was not a problem for him, but he\nhad two friends who did have problems, because for one of them his bones were\n5 6 J O U R N A L O F S O C I A L W O R K P R A C T I C E\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \ngrowing faster than his muscles and ligaments and for the other friend it was the other\nway round, that his muscles were growing faster than his bones. One of them was\nvery stiff and the other was very floppy. This disaster, it can be noted, is located,\nthrough projection, in a friend.\nIn psychoanalytic thinking, the fluidity of internal organisation of the early\nadolescent period has been thought for some time to provide opportunities for\nreworking early experiences, providing a \u2018second chance\u2019 to experience key\ndevelopmental issues. Recently, some unlikely corroboration of these ideas has\nemerged. Studies of rodents show that the effects of early maternal deprivation can be\nreversed if there are favourable conditions at puberty. Neuroscientific studies of the\nbrain are providing some exciting new avenues of understanding adolescent\ndevelopment. Though the state of understanding is as yet uncertain in many respects,\nthe current consensus is that changes to the brain occur during puberty and continue\nfor up to another decade into early adulthood. Blakemore\u2019s MRI studies (e.g.\nChoudhury et al., 2006) show that social competency changes and develops\nthroughout adolescence, particularly the capacity to take account of another\u2019s\nperspective. Thus changes in the brain at puberty create a situation of \u2018neural\nplasticity\u2019 (Patton & Viner, 2007). There is the opportunity for a different set of\nexperiences to have significance and change developmental pathways. There is, as\nPatton and Viner (2007) suggest, the opportunity to rework developmental\nexperiences:\nwhere the effects of earlier adversity may be ameliorated and where experience\nmay shape brain development and later emotional functioning.\n(p. 1136)\nThe key to this is that favourable environmental circumstances need to be present\nto permit this reworking. Favourable experiences include, as Patel et al. (2007)\nsummarise from longitudinal research studies, \u2018a sense of connection, low levels of\nconflict and an environment in which expression of emotions is encouraged\u2019\n(p. 1305). Adverse circumstances during the pubertal years such as family conflict,\ndivorce, or peer violence and rejection are likely to have a particularly acute impact\non subsequent development (Patton & Viner, 2007, p. 1134). Unfavourable\nexperiences will simply generate a \u2018second helping\u2019 repeating and reinvesting the\ndeprivations of the early years with another dose when it matters in early adolescence.\nIn these circumstances, mental health problems are likely to be severe.\nAre there high levels of mental health difficulties in adolescence?\nThe third question I will address is whether there are high levels of mental health\nproblems in adolescence. Most evidence points out that the level is unacceptably high.\nPatel et al. (2007) conclude that the \u2018burden\u2019 of mental disorder (worldwide) in\nadolescence is high: between 1 in 4 and 1 in 5 adolescents in any one year are likely to\nexperience a mental health problem. Young Minds has collated the extent of the\nproblem in the following summary of statistics and evidence:\nR I S K S A N D O P P O R T U N I T I E S I N A D O L E S C E N C E 5 7\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nN 1 in 10 children and young people aged 5\u201316 suffer from a diagnosable mental\nhealth disorder \u2014 that is around three in every class (Green et al., 2005);\nN between 1 in 12 and 1 in 15 children and young people deliberately self-harm\n(Mental Health Foundation, 2006) and around 25,000 are admitted to hospital\nevery year due to the severity of their injuries (Fox & Hawton, 2004);\nN over half of all adults with mental health problems were diagnosed in childhood.\nLess than half were treated appropriately at the time (Kim-Cohen et al., 2003);\nN nearly 80,000 children and young people suffer from severe depression (Office\nfor National Statistics, 2004);\nN over 8,000 children under 10-years-old suffer from severe depression (Office for\nNational Statistics, 2004);\nN 45% of children in care have a mental health disorder \u2014 these are some of the\nmost vulnerable people in our society (Meltzer et al., 2003);\nN 95% of imprisoned young offenders have a mental health disorder. Many of them\nare struggling with more than one type (Office for National Statistics, 1997).\nAnyone working in front-line child and adolescent mental health services will\nprobably recognise this picture; high rates of self-harm, depression and offending\nbehaviour. Services often feel flooded by \u2018difficult\u2019 cases, and that work is \u2018getting\nmore difficult\u2019. It is important, though, to look at what these statistics might be\nconveying.\nFirstly, we can note that the list here consists of a number of different kinds of\nidentifiers, including diagnoses (depression), behaviours (self-harm and offending) and\nsocial categories (e.g. looked after children and offenders). These are therefore different\nways of recording mental health difficulties; behavioural, social and medical (or\npsychiatric).\nIn recent years we have witnessed \u2014 and I do not think this is an exaggeration \u2014\na \u2018psychiatric deluge\u2019; diagnoses such as \u2018conduct disorders\u2019 are prominent, outcomes\nof intervention are measured in \u2018symptom change\u2019 and assessment of interventions\nbased on risk assessment and management. The (psychiatric) diagnostic and risk\nassessment focused approaches flatten and concretise the experiences that lie behind\ndiagnoses such as conduct disorders, depression and self-harm. These are the outcome\nof complex internal organisations, and each \u2018symptom\u2019 or \u2018syndrome\u2019 contains a\nrange of different relational constellations. For example, in a study of underlying\nrelational patterns and suicidal risks, we (Wright et al., 2005) found some distinctive\npatterns.\nSome suicidal adolescents stir up terrific anxiety in others, whilst others can leave\none unaffected, or unworried, and surprised that the adolescent was suicidal. (\u2018I never\nknew s\/he was thinking like that\u2019: Briggs, 2002). In the therapeutic setting, the\nexperience is that the worker experiences different kinds of emotional reactions, or\ncounter-transference. This indicates that though the concern is similar \u2014 suicidality\n\u2014 this is driven by different internal patterns of relatedness.\nWe compared the internal relationship patterns of suicidal and non-suicidal\nadolescents. We interviewed the adolescents using a semi-projective interview\nschedule that generated narrative accounts of the adolescents\u2019 responses to different\nsituations that involved a separation. The interviews were analysed quantitatively and\nqualitatively. We found that the suicidal adolescents were more insecure (less\n5 8 J O U R N A L O F S O C I A L W O R K P R A C T I C E\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nemotionally open, more pessimistic, more self-blaming, less coherent in their\nnarratives) \u2014 but they used different attachment strategies for dealing with emotional\ndifficulties. One group, highly preoccupied or enmeshed, tended to talk anxiously and\nat great length about their difficulties, seeming to worry about everything (without\nprioritising what should be most worrying). For example, one participant spoke for\nseveral minutes \u2014 with varying qualities of coherence \u2014 building up an account with\na great sense of worry, until she provided a picture of being trapped within her body,\nher lack of capacity to control it, and her fear of negative peer judgements.\nA second group dismissed, downplayed, negated or denied emotional\nexperiences, so that an emotional issue was introduced by a negative: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t\nsay I was bothered about it\u2019. Alongside this, adolescents in this group spoke about \u2018not\nthinking\u2019 about emotions, or relationships. Interestingly, these narrative patterns were\n\u2018applied to the adolescents\u2019 relationships to their own body as well as to relationships\nwith others. Suicidal adolescents \u2014 in both insecure attachment groups \u2014 related to\ntheir bodies as out of their control, and that the attempt to exert control was\noverwhelming. In the face of this difficulty, submission and despair occurred.\nThe preoccupied group \u2018hyperactivate\u2019 the emotional and relational links with\nothers, and the dismissing group aim to \u2018deactivate\u2019 these links. This leads to two\ndistinctive kinds of narrative for suicidal adolescents: the preoccupied group generate\n\u2018narratives of enactment\u2019 pursuing their pattern of relatedness with others, engaging\nthem in the replication and repetition of these conflicts. The dismissing group create\n\u2018narratives of elimination\u2019, aiming to shut down contact with others and escape from\nor obliterate relatedness. For this group being engaged in emotional discussion is in\nitself intolerable.\nThese findings map on to and make sense of clinical experiences of being\nemotionally affected in different ways, and they provide a route into identifying\nrelational patterns leading to suicidal risks. Thus taking a developmental approach\nhelps to distinguish different developmental pathways for individuals with specific\nproblems and thus revitalise the connections between different kinds of individual\nexperience, development and mental health problems. This approach can be applied\nto the \u2018diagnoses\u2019 that show high levels of mental health problems in adolescence.\nAs we have seen, time trends in adolescence show that conduct disorders are\nincreasing (Collishaw et al., 2004). This fits with media views of adolescence that\nhighlight violence and crime, stealing, lying and disobedience. We know that many\nadult mental health problems in this area begin in adolescence. Conduct disorders that\npersist through life, sometimes referred to as Life-Course Persistent, affect 1\/20 of\nthe age group, whereas it is more common (1 in 4 of the age group) for \u2018conduct\ndisorders\u2019 to begin and end in adolescence (Graham, 2004). \u2018Conduct disorder\u2019 used\nto be called \u2018delinquency\u2019. Keeping this now \u2014 apparently \u2014 anachronistic term,\ndelinquency, in mind as adolescent and \u2018developmental\u2019 behaviour, offers the capacity\nto link experiences and behaviour in psychosocial contexts with the possibility of\nunderstanding the meaning behind particular acts. Moreover, this also provides the\nopportunity for more accurately and earlier identifying the Life-Course Persistent\ngroup, and offering different and more effective and earlier interventions.\nDepression can be discussed in similar terms. Depression is a summary term\nwhich accounts for a range of feelings \u2014 sadness, misery, disappointment through to\nR I S K S A N D O P P O R T U N I T I E S I N A D O L E S C E N C E 5 9\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nself-blaming, despair and hopelessness, and an intense sense of aggression directed\nagainst the self (or a part of the self). It is experienced in varying degrees of severity,\nand duration, through the life course. At the extreme (in terms of degree) is clinical\ndepression. The incidence of depression increases in adolescence. It is important to\ndistinguish degree of depression, its persistence and the propensity for this to develop\ninto self-harm and suicidal behaviour. However, it is also important to distinguish\nbetween different qualities of depression; on the one hand \u2018depression\u2019 (which here\nneeds to be in inverted commas) means depressive, and includes sadness, the pain of\nloss and concern about another; on the other hand it is a more agitated or in reality an\ninternally persecuted state in which self-criticisms, recriminations and blame feature;\nthis is paranoid-schizoid, and not depressive.\nDiagnoses of depression inappropriately labels all depression as a \u2018bad thing\u2019, and\nsomething to be got rid of. Sometimes, in fact, some depression can be an interim\noutcome especially for young people prone to act destructively. The crucial factor is\nwhether the individual, supported by adults, can bear and make sense of depressed\nfeelings. Depression in adolescence is not new. Thirty years ago, Hyatt Williams\nwrote\nDuring adolescence it is common to encounter depression. What happens during\nits course depends on a bewildering variety of factors. If the depression can be\nborne, sustained and worked through, there often follows an efflorescence of\nemotional growth.\n(Williams, 1978, p. 309)\nOne of the aims of therapeutic work is to help adolescents sustain feelings \u2014\neven those not particularly pleasant ones like depression \u2014 and help tolerate the\ndifficulties in bearing and thinking about these. The therapeutic value of this can be\nseen in the following clinical vignette:\nHoward, was 21 when he came for his first assessment session three weeks before\nChristmas \u2014 he turned up nearly 30 minutes late wrapped in a large coat; he held\nhis appointment letter tightly in his hand as if he feared losing it. He made\napologies for being late quipping rather lamely about his geography degree not\nhelping much with map reading. He then gave an account of his family history,\ndescribing an entanglement with his mother and his contempt for his father who\nwas, he said, \u2018about as useless as a hole in the head\u2019. Then he told me of his\npropensity to find all kinds of ways of putting himself into risky situations \u2014\njumping out of moving taxis, walking alone drunk around central London in the\nearly hours, (acting one might say as though he had a hole in his head) and then\nthreatening to make suicide attempts. The incidents intensified as Christmas drew\nnearer, and as we approached a break in sessions over the holiday period my\nanxieties also intensified. I felt I was helpless and useless \u2014 like he described his\nfather in fact. The risky and suicidal behaviour always occurred when he was\ndrunk, and in my state of some desperation I suggested one thing to try would be\nnot to drink. In response he went ballistic \u2014 how stupid I was; he comes all the\nway here to this esteemed (the word emphasized with total contempt) institution,\n6 0 J O U R N A L O F S O C I A L W O R K P R A C T I C E\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nand that is all I have to say \u2014 how pathetic. Despite the onslaught I stuck to my\nguns and said that nevertheless, although he considers me to be absolutely stupid,\nI did think that this could be important. I was left with a great deal of anxiety\nabout him over the Christmas break but found on my return the suicidal\nbehaviour had reduced.\nThis did not prevent Howard continuing to rage at me. Even though week by\nweek there were considerable improvements, he complained with rage and\ncontempt, that before coming here he had been all right. If there was a problem\nhe would get drunk and \u2018do something\u2019. Now, he can\u2019t do that because I \u2018make\nhim think\u2019, and then he \u2018gets depressed\u2019.\nThis therapeutic process demonstrates a shift from acting out to depression,\naccompanied by pains that were felt to be unbearable, and the therapist is called upon\nto withstand the force of these emotions, the rage and the complaints through which\ninner distress is communicated.\nConclusion\nIn order to explore contemporary themes of adolescent mental health, in this paper I\nhave addressed three key, overlapping questions. The discourse that there is an\nincrease in adolescent mental health difficulties is not substantiated by available\nresearch knowledge and appears, rather, to be a media-led example in the genre of\n\u2018folk devils and moral panics\u2019. This resituates the discussion as interactional, driven as\nmuch by adult attitudes to young people as by the behaviour of young people; I\nsuggest this is partly driven by fear of adolescent emotionality.\nCurrent policy initiatives, based on the notion that a minority of adolescents are\nto blame, underestimates the extent to which changing contexts for adolescent\ndevelopment have impacted on young people. The extent of these changes leads to the\nneed to reconceptualise adolescent development and, though inevitably lagging behind\nexperience, new theorisations are beginning to emerge, recognising the diversity of\nthe routes through adolescence into adulthood. The emphasis is currently on the\ndistinction between fast and slow track routes into adulthood, the impact of these on\nidentity and subjectivity and the different kinds of identity formation that are taking\nplace now, compared with previous generations of modern adolescence.\nConceptualising identity as being formed through relatedness to others to constitute\na fluid, elusive subjectivity has potential for developing theoretical accounts of a\npsychosocial subject, that takes into account internal as well as social aspects of\nsubjectivity.\nThere is strong evidence for the existence of high levels of mental health\ndifficulties in adolescence, evidence that comes as no surprise to front line\npractitioners. The current predominance of a diagnostic approach has the effect of\ncollapsing distinctions within categories such as depression and \u2018conduct problems\u2019\nand undervaluing the importance of psychosocial descriptions of individual problems.\nThus the diagnostic approach is detrimental to understanding important facets of\ndevelopment. Restoring and reasserting a developmental approach to adolescence\nR I S K S A N D O P P O R T U N I T I E S I N A D O L E S C E N C E 6 1\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nby\n [T\nav\nist\noc\nk &\n Po\nrtm\nan\n] a\nt 0\n6:2\n4 0\n9 A\nug\nus\nt 2\n01\n1 \nincreases sensitivity to adolescent difficulties and makes it possible to relate to the\nneeds of young people and provide effective interventions. Relating to adolescence as\na developmental unity \u2014 beginning with the transformations of puberty and\ncontinually working through these until the transition to adulthood is achieved \u2014 and\nbeing prepared through reflective emotional involvement to face and work with issues\nof relatedness and emotionality between adolescents and adults, are the key conditions\nfor working with and making policies for young people. There is, therefore, a strong\npossibility that current initiatives to develop services will fall short unless these are\nconfigured in ways that take these factors into account. Particularly, it is necessary to\nprioritise assessments that differentiate developmental pathways rather than being\ndiagnosis-led. Services need to be constructed across the entire range of adolescence,\nincluding, rather than excluding the pubertal (under 16) or the young adult (over 18)\nperiods.\nAcknowledgement\nAn earlier version was presented as the author\u2019s inaugural lecture at University of East\nLondon on 21 October 2008.\nNotes\n1 Beverley Hughes, MP, is Minister of State for Children, Young People and Families.\n2 The six objectives of \u2018Aiming High\u2019 are: (1) rebalancing the public narrative about\nyoung people; (2) empowering young people to increase their influence over the\ndesign and delivery of services for them; (3) increasing the number of local places\nfor young people to go; (4) removing barriers and supporting young people to\naccess local opportunities and services for them; (5) improving the capacity and\nquality of services for young people; and (6) supporting and developing the youth\nworkforce to employ the very best practice in working with young people.\nReferences\nAnderson, R.
