I argue that the studies presented in the original paper could be enhanced\nby a more rigorous approach to gender that avoids universalizing identity, recognizes\ngender as a construction and which builds on previous research from gender, science and\ntechnology studies.\nAfter the surge in research and literature on gender, science and technology in the 1980s\nand early 1990s, this paper brings us up to date with the growth in computer-supported\nlearning (CSL), adding an extra dimension since computer technology is now a mode of\ndelivery as well as a discipline under study. The evidence presented in this paper that a\ngender gap in access and IT literacy has been steadily closing during the 1990s seems to\nfollow the closing of gender gaps in access and achievement in science and technology\nsubjects in the UK (Arnot, David and Weiner, 1996). However, a closer look suggests that\ndiscriminatory practices that disadvantage females and males in CSL persist, and I suggest\nthat there are some lessons which can be learned from the earlier gender, science and\ntechnology literature to avoid over-simplifying gender and assuming that undesirable\ngender effects can be easily overcome with good practice recommendations.\nFirstly, research that universalizes gender by assuming that all females (or males) have\ncommon experiences is problematic. The authors acknowledge in their conclusion that\n'issues of gender should not be treated in isolation from other factors', including\neducational backgrounds, but most of the studies reviewed in the paper did the opposite. A\nrange of identities intersect with gender, such as ethnicity, class (Hughes, 2001), as well as\nsexuality and disability. Age (generation) was briefly mentioned in the article and is likely\nto be significant too. The case studies presented here are of IT and Web design courses\nand, consistent with European Union gender segregation statistics in computing and IT at\n77\nGwyneth Hughes Gender issues in computer-supported learning\nhigher education level (Rees, 2001), we know that the IT course is male-dominated. It\nwould be useful to have this information for the Web design case study too. Despite the\ngender bias, the females performed well, but this is not necessarily a straightforward gender\neffect. Studies of other 'masculine' constructed disciplines such as physics and engineering\nhave found that the women succeed, although they may have a difficult time, but this is\nbecause they are middle-class and academically advantaged female students (Thomas,\n1990). Meanwhile, male underperformance in education in general has been linked to\nparticular forms of (often class- and age-differentiated) masculinity which reject or play\ndown academic study (Connell, 1995). Ethnicity may add more complexity as there is\nevidence that Black females are more willing to persevere with masculine areas of study\nthan their white counterparts because of the career opportunities in an inequitable job\nmarket (Mirza, 1992; Hughes, 2001). Because of such differences between females, the two\nstatements about girls' achievement given in the introduction are not necessarily\ncontradictory - it depends on which girls are counted.\nSecondly, and to add further complexity, there is a body of theory that views gender as a\nconstructed rather than essential characteristic (for example, Davies, 1989), and this too is\nmissing from the discussion. Rowan (2000) explains that it is not only differences between\nwomen, but differences, or conflicting identities, within women that produce the apparent\ngender differences in behaviour in CSL environments. It is not easy to construct a feminine\nidentity while undertaking masculine activities, and female reporting of lack of confidence\nwith Internet technology could be one way of dealing with internal gender conflict in a\nsymbolically and culturally masculine environment of cyberspace. Thus, examining the\ncontext in which a gender identity is produced is very important. Essentialist approaches to\ngender have focused on learner deficiencies and tend to underplay the importance of\neducational and social factors on reproducing gender effects.\nThe authors do go some way towards acknowledging the importance of social context by\nstating that 'social issues such as ownership of technology are at the forefront of research\nand need further discussion'. Wacjman (1991) has pointed out that technology does not\ntransform, but tends to reproduce, social relations. The authors implicitly support this\napproach in evidence from Herring that gender interactions and inequities in CSL\nreproduce those of traditional environments, and in their concern that the design of course\nmanagement systems reproduces conventional didactic, rather than constructivist, learning\nenvironments. However, other links between gender identities and context are not made. It\nis not clear how far the gender effects reported in the paper arise from the use of\ntechnology as a learning tool, or because the technology is the subject of study, or indeed\nan inter-relationship between the two. Do the gender associations of the discipline make a\ndifference; for example, are the gender issues of CMC (computer-mediated communica-\ntion) different in sociology from computer studies?\nFinally, recommendations for designers to construct well-moderated, flexible learning\nenvironments that are appropriate for a wide range of learners are valuable. However, the\nlimited impact of initiatives such as WISE (Women into Science and Engineering)\n(Henwood, 1996) would suggest that there is no guarantee that gender divisions will readily\ndisappear. Care must be taken that recommendations do not merely reinforce gender\nbinaries by highlighting gender difference (as in the suggestions that males prefer games\nand females more collaborative activities). Although the audience for the ALT-C panel\n78\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nwanted solutions rather than more research on causes of gender inequalities, I would argue\nthat quick fixes are unlikely to be found. Challenging the restrictions of gender binaries,\nwithout ignoring gender completely, is a tricky business and requires a sound appreciation\nof the complexities. Fortunately, the foundations for further exploration of gender and\nCSL already exist in an established body of related work.\nReferences\nArnot, M., David, M. and Weiner, G.
