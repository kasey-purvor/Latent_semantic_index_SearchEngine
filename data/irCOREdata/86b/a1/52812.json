In addition, it has been observed that these surface enhancements can augment the \nbiomimetic nature of the laser irradiated materials. This research has employed a CO2 laser marker to \nproduce trench and hatch topographical patterns with peak heights of around 1 \u03bcm on the surface of \nnylon 6,6. The patterns generated have been analysed using white light interferometery, optical \nmicroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to determine the surface oxygen \ncontent. Contact angle measurements were used to characterize each sample in terms of wettability. \nGenerally, it was seen that as a result of laser processing the contact angle, surface roughness and \nsurface oxygen content increased whilst the apparent polar and total surface energies decreased. The \nincrease in contact angle and reduction in surface energy components was found to be on account of a \nmixed intermediate state wetting regime owing to the change in roughness due to the induced \ntopographical patterns. To determine the biomimetic nature of the modified and as-received control \nsamples each one was seeded with 2\u00d710\n4 \ncells\/ml normal human osteoblast cells and observed after \nperiods of 24 hours and 4 days using optical microscopy and SEM to determine mean cell cover \ndensities and variations in cell morphology. In addition a haeymocytometer was used to show that the \ncell count for the laser patterned samples had increased by up to a factor of 1.5 compared to the as-\nreceived control sample after 4 days of incubation. Significantly, it was determined that all laser-\ninduced patterns gave rise to better cell response in comparison to the as-received control sample \nstudied due to increased preferential cell growth on those surfaces with increased surface roughness. \nKeywords: CO2 laser, nylon 6,6, wettability, osteoblast cells, bioactivity \n2 \u2013 Introduction \n \nIt is seen that nylon can be utilized within the biomaterial industry as sutures [1], vascular grafts [2] \nand other hard tissue implants [3]. By extrapolating from past and current research it is imperative that \nany biomaterial should be optimized in order for that material to function appropriately and efficiently \nwithin the desired biological environment. In numerous instances it is seen that the bulk properties of \na biomaterial are decided upon such that the surface properties are compromised [4,5]. In particular, \nthis is seen throughout the use of polymeric biomaterials as they offer excellent bulk properties for \nbiological applications; however, the surface properties they possess do not lend themselves to high \nperformance in regards to biomimetics [6]. On account of this, it is necessary to vary the surface \nproperties of the material without hindering the bulk properties in order to enhance the wettability and \nbioactivity. In terms of bioactivity a biomaterial can be surface modified both topographically and \nchemically in order to manipulate the way in which the cells react. That is the signaling of the cells \n 3 \ncould be optimized in order for the filopodia to assess the extracellular matrix (ECM) and substrate so \nthat the most possible integrin receptors could be localized around the suitable binding site to improve \nupon adhesion characteristics [7]. This is of great importance to those cells such as osteoblast cells \nthat are highly dependant on ECM anchorage and as a direct result necessitates adhesion with the \nbiomaterial prior to the initialization of normal cell function [8]. Integrin receptors are crucial to the \nway in which a biomaterial is accepted into the biological environment insofar as cellular interactions \ntakes place through the receptors creating focal adhesions. These focal adhesions are also important as \nthey produce a high density of adhesion transmembrance receptors in areas of cellular adhesion to the \nbiomaterial owed to the fact that they are closely associated with the actin cytoskeleton and other \nfactors which regulate the signaling that takes place as the cell functions [9]. \nOne of the most interesting subject areas in biomaterials surface science is that of wettability, with  \nmany workers endeavoring to determine the complex links between surface wetting and bioactivity \n[10]. Numerous theories have been expressed in order to explain this phenomenon in which two basic \nregimes have arisen. The first takes the biomimetic properties and attempts to correlate it with the \nsurface energy whilst the second involves water solvent properties near the surface in which a \ncorrelation between the contact angle and bioactivity is strived for. However, in both cases a \nfundamental factor dominates in which the surface energy\/wetting is generally related somewhat to \nthe biological response [11]. Various approaches have been undertaken as to ascertain quantitative \nreasoning to bioactivity such as Van Oss et al. [12] by using the \u2018equation of state\u2019 approach to \ncalculate interfacial tensions from previously measured contact angles in order to attempt and predict \ncell adhesion. Such approaches have been found to fall short for achieving a quantitative theory \nregarding the bioactivity of a material. Through the available literature it can be seen that extensive \nresearch is now being carried out regarding this in the attempt to link wettability and bioactivity of \nmaterials [13,14]. Once a quantitative link has been forged between these two parameters one can \nextrapolate that this will give those throughout the biotechnological industry a means to produce \nmaterials which have the ability to either enhance or even hinder the biomimetic nature; for instance, \nmaterials produced with surfaces that hinder the growth of bacteria could be widely used throughout \nthe food packaging industry. On the other hand, enhanced biomimetics could be utilized for numerous \napplications such as biological implants and BioMEMs applications [15]. \nNumerous techniques have been developed that have the ability to modify the surfaces of different \nmaterials [16]. Some of these methods are radiation grafting [17], plasma surface modification [18,19] \nand using various coatings [20]. Another method which has the ability to produce surface \nmodifications is that of laser treatment [21,22] and offers a number of benefits such as accurate, \nprecise, non-contact and clean processing. One other major advantage that lasers offer over other \ncompeting techniques is that they can produce micro and nano scale topographical and surface \nchemical variations with negligible affect to the bulk properties of the material. Also, it should be \n 4 \nnoted that as most laser systems are now automated this technique holds the ability to be used for \nlarge area processing. Being able to produce these topographical and surface chemical variations can \nbe seen to be of great advantage when applying laser surface modification to fields such as \nbiomimetics especially as previous work has shown a very high dependence of micro and nano scale \ntopography and surface chemistry on the cell-material interaction [7-9,15,16,22,23].  \nOn account of the numerous advantages laser materials processing has to offer for laser surface \ntreatment it is necessary that considerable research is undertaken to ascertain how this technique can \nbe employed in such fields as biotechnology. Such research will lead to the ability of assessing the \nplausibility and reliability for using lasers to produce surface modifications to aid in the enhancement \nof the biomimetic nature of biomaterials. On account of the required significant research in this field \nthe first ever initial study into how CO2 laser generated surface patterns influence both the wettability \ncharacteristics of nylon 6,6 and normal human osteoblast cell response, when studied in vitro, has \nbeen carried out. This investigation has taken place in order to study how the biomimetic nature of \nlaser surface patterned nylon 6,6 can be affected by surface properties such as characteristic recently \nadvancing contact angle, surface roughness, surface oxygen content and the surface energy. \n \n3 \u2013 Experimental Techniques \n \n3.1 \u2013 Laser Irradiation Procedure \n \nThe nylon 6,6 was sourced in 100\u00d7100 mm\n2\n sheets with a thickness of 5 mm (Goodfellow \nCambridge, Ltd). To obtain a conveniently sized sample for experimentation the as-received nylon \nsheet was cut into 30 mm diameter discs using a 1 kW continuous wave (cw) CO2 laser (Everlase \nS48; Coherent, Ltd). No discernible heat affected zone (HAZ) was observed under optical \nmicroscopic examination.  \nIn order to generate the required marking pattern with the 10.6 \u03bcm Synrad cw 10W CO2 laser system \nSynrad Winmark software version 2.1.0, build 3468 was used. In addition, the software was capable \nof using images saved as .dxf files which can be produced by using CAD programs such as, in this \ncase, Licom AutoCaM. The nylon 6,6 samples where placed into the laser system onto a stage in \nwhich they where held in place using a bracket with a 30.5 mm diameter hole cut into the centre of the \nbracket. The surface of the sample was set to be 250 mm away from the output facet of the laser \nsystem to obtain focus and the system utilized a galvanometer scanner to scan the 95 \u03bcm spot size \nbeam directly across the stationary target material. It should be noted that the target material and laser \nsystem was held in a laser safety cabinet in which the ambient gas was air and an extraction system \nwas used to remove any fumes produced during laser processing.  \n \n 5 \n20 samples were irradiated altogether to produce 4 identical 6-well plates with each corresponding \nwell having the same pattern. These were named plates 1A, 1, 2 and 3. There were four patterns \ninduced onto the surfaces of the nylon 6,6 samples which were trenches with 50 \u03bcm spacing (A3), \nhatch with 50 \u03bcm spacing (B1), trenches with 100 \u03bcm spacing (B2) and hatch with 100 \u03bcm spacing \n(B3). In addition, an as-received control sample was used (A1). For each of the irradiated patterns the \nlaser power was set to 70% (7 W) operating at 600 mms\n-1\n. \n \n3.2 \u2013 Topography, Wettability Characteristics and Surface Chemistry Analysis \n \nAfter the laser irradiation of the nylon 6,6 samples plate 1A was analysed using a number of \ntechniques. An optical microscope (Flash 200 Smartscope; OGP, Ltd) was used to obtain optical \nmicrographs of the samples. The surface profiles were determined using a white light interferometer \n(WLI) (NewView 500; Zygo, Ltd) with MetroPro and TalyMap Gold Software. The Zygo WLI was \nsetup using a \u00d710 Mirau lens with a zoom of \u00d70.5 and working distance of 7.6 mm. This system also \nallowed Sa and Ra roughness parameters to be determined for each sample. \nIn accordance with the procedure detailed by Rance [24] the samples were ultrasonically cleaned in \nisoproponal (Fisher Scientific Ltd., UK) for 3 minutes at room temperature before using a sessile drop \ndevice to determine various wettability characteristics. This was to allow for a relatively clean surface \nprior to any contact angle measurements being taken. To ensure that the sample surfaces were dry a \nspecimen dryer (Metaserv, UK) was utilized to blow ambient air across the samples. A sessile drop \ndevice (OCA20; Dataphysics Instruments, GmbH) was used with relevant software (SCA20; \nDataphysics Intrsuments, GmbH) to allow the recent advancing and receding contact angles for triply \ndistilled water and the recent advancing angle for diodomethane to be determined for each sample. \nFrom the measured advancing and receding contact angles the hysteresis for the system was \nestablished. Thereafter the advancing contact angles for the two liquids were used by the software to \ndraw an Owens, Wendt, Rabel and Kaeble (OWRK) plot to determine the surface energy of the \nsamples. For the two reference liquids the SCA20 software used the Str\u00f6m et al. technique to \ncalculate the surface energy of the material. It should be noted here that ten contact angles, using two \ndroplets, in each instance was recorded to achieve a mean contact angle for each liquid and surface.   \nSelected samples were analysed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. This allowed \nany surface modifications in terms of surface oxygen content due to the laser irradiation to be \nrevealed. These samples were selected in terms of contact angle; the as-received reference sample, \nlaser patterned sample with the lowest contact angle and the laser surface patterned sample with the \nhighest contact angle was used. XPS measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD \nphotoelectron spectrometer employing monochromatic aluminium k-alpha radiation source, operating \nat 120W power and an associated photon energy of 1486.6 eV. To test the reproducability of the \n 6 \nsurface, two sections of each sample were analysed; the analysis area on each sample was 700x300 \nmicrons. The spectrometer was run in its Hybrid mode and spectra were acquired at pass energies of \n20 eV (for the high resolution scans) and 160 eV for the survey scans. All data was analysed through \nCasaXPS (v2.3.14) analysis software (ref: http:\/\/www.casaxps.com) using sensitivity factors supplied \nby the instrument manufacturer.  \n \n3.3 \u2013 In Vitro Experimentation \n \nPrior to any biological testing being carried out the samples were autoclaved (D-Series Bench-Top \nAutoclave; Systec, GmbH) to ensure that all samples were sterilized. For all biological work \nundertaken, unless stated, a biological safety cabinet (BSC) (Microflow Class II ABS Cabinet; \nBioQuell UK, Ltd) was used to create a safe working environment and to provide a clean, sterile \nenvironment to manipulate the cells used. \n \nNormal human osteoblast cells (Clonetics CC-2538; Lonza, Inc.) were initially cultured in a T75 \n(75ml) flask by suspending the cells in 19 ml culture medium comprising of 90% eagle minimum \nessential medium (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). \nThe flask was then placed in an incubator and left for 24 hours. After 24 hours the cells were assessed \nand the spent media was aspirated before dispensing 15 ml of fresh media and returning the flask to \nthe incubator for 3 days.  \n \nThe period of 3 days allowed the cells to become confluent in the flask providing enough cells for \nseeding onto the samples. The cells were detached from the flask using 5 ml Trypisn-EDTA (Sigma-\nAldrich, UK) whilst placed in the incubator for seven minutes. Once all cells had become detached \n10ml culture medium was added to neutralize the Trypsin. In order to aspirate the supernatant the cell \nculture was centrifuged (U-320R; Boeco, GmbH) for five minutes at 200 g. To ensure the cells were \nready for seeding they were resuspended in 10 ml of culture medium and dispensed between the \neighteen samples in the 6-well plates. This equated to 0.55 ml (2\u00d710\n4\n cells\/ml) for each sample. The \nwell plates were placed in the incubator were plate 1 was removed after 24 hours and plates 2 and 3 \nafter 4 days. Plates 1 and 2 were prepared for the SEM as will be discussed later and plate 3 was \nprepared for counting using an improved neubauer haemocytometer (Fisher Scientific, UK) by mixing \n10 \u03bcl of each cell suspension with 10 \u03bcl of trypan-blue (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). \n \n3.4 \u2013 SEM and Optical Microscopy Analysis of In Vitro Samples \n \nIn order to view the attached cells using SEM it was necessary to undertake a procedure to produce a \nsample that was dehydrated ready for Au coating. The samples were initially rinsed with phosphate-\n 7 \nbuffered saline (PBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) to remove any unattached cells and then adherent cells \nwere fixed using 1.2% glutaraldehyde in water (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) at room temperature for 1 hour \nwithin the BSC. After an hour the glutaraldehyde solution was removed and the fixed cells were \nwashed with PBS prior to carrying out a graded series of ethanol\/distilled water mixtures of 50\/50, \n80\/20, 90\/10, 95\/5, 98\/2 and 100\/0. Each sample was left in these mixtures for 10 minutes to ensure \ndehydration. Once this procedure was carried out the samples were mounted and sputter coated with \nAu so that SEM images could be obtained. In addition to SEM images, optical micrographs were \nobtained using an optical microscope (Optiphot; Nikon, UK) with a 5\u00d7 Nikon objective lens, with \nimages being captured using a microscope camera (WV-CL300; Panasonic, UK) along with DT \nAcquire Version 3.3.0 computer software (Data Translation Inc., USA). In order to produce the best \nimages possible each image was manipulated in terms of brightness, contrast and gamma by using \nImagePro Version 5.0.0.39 for Windows XP\/Professional software (Media Cybernetics Inc., USA).  \n \n3.5 \u2013 Statistical Analysis \n \nAll statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 16.0.2 for Windows software (SPSS Inc., USA) in \norder to analyse the data obtained using one-way ANOVA to obtain F-ratios and significance levels \n(p). In addition to ANOVA analysis post hoc multiple comparison tests in the form of Scheffe\u2019s range \ntests where performed in order to determine statistic significance between groups in which results are \nreported at a mean difference significance level of p<0.05.  \n \n4 \u2013 Results and Discussion \n \n4.1 \u2013 Effect of Laser Irradiation on Topography  \n \nIt has already been confirmed from previous work that the process in which the infra-red laser light \ncouples into the nylon 6,6 is that of a thermolytical nature [25] rather than direct bond disassociation \nwhich occurs with UV lasers. That is, the irradiated surface becomes molten due to a rapid \ntemperature rise which leads to a protrusion away from the surface as a direct result of flow within the \nmolten material along with rapid resolidification as the beam moves away from that area. By utilizing  \nthe constant laser parameters of 7 W and a traverse speed of 600 mms\n-1\n various patterns were induced \nonto the surface of the nylon 6,6. The continuous axonometric images for these patterns are shown in \nFigure 1. \n \nIt can be seen from Figure 1 that qualitatively the laser irradiated nylon 6,6 samples were considerably \nrougher in comparison to the as-received reference control sample. Further confirmation of this \nqualitative result was obtained by taking a profile extraction of each sample (see Figure 2). From \n 8 \nFigures 1(d) and (e ) it was possible to ascertain that the resulting surface pattern was more defined in \none axis of the hatch in comparison to the other. This is a resultant of the way in which the CO2  laser \nmarker scanned the input image onto the target sample. \n \nThe profile extractions for each of the samples shown in Figure 2 provides confirmation that the laser \nprocessing of the nylon 6,6 gave rise to a considerable variation in the surface topography. That is, the \nroughness had increased and slight periodicity in the laser patterned samples can be seen in contrast to \nthe as-received reference control sample. In comparison to the as-received reference control sample, \nwhich had peak heights of the order of 0.1 to 0.2 \u03bcm, the peak heights for all of the laser treated \nsamples were around 1 \u03bcm. It was also observed that the least periodicity arose from those samples \nwhich had patterns with 50 \u03bcm spacings . This can be seen to be of some importance as the laser spot \nsize at the surface of the target samples was 95 \u03bcm consequently allowing the scans for the trenches \nand hatch patterns to overlap and ultimately eliminate the natural periodicity of the original scanned \npattern. However, the scan overlap occurring did ensure that the whole of the surface of the target \nsample was irradiated and modified in comparison to the non-irradiated reference sample. For the \nlaser surface modified samples (see Figures 2(b-g)) peak heights of approximately 1 \u03bcm was \nachieved.  \n \n4.2 \u2013  Effect of Laser Irradiation on the Wettability Characteristics \n \nAs already stated in the available literature, the surface properties of a material have a major influence \non the way in which a liquid will react at the interface between the liquid and material surface. As \nsuch, the surface roughness parameters (Sa and Ra), contact angle for triply distilled water and surface \nenergy parameters were determined for each sample and are given in Table 1. \n \nThe results given in Table 1 show that the laser surface treatment has given rise to sufficiently \nincreased surface roughness in comparison to the as-received reference control sample (A1) with the \nlargest Sa being 0.636 for the 50 \u03bcm trenches pattern (A3) and the largest Ra being 0.185 \u03bcm for the \n100 \u03bcm trenches pattern (B2). It was also determined that the apparent polar component, \u03b3P, and total \nsurface energy, \u03b3T, was seen to decrease for all laser treated samples compared to that of the as-\nreceived reference control sample. As a result of the reduction in apparent \u03b3P and the increase in \nsurface roughness the recently advancing contact angle was seen to increase. As a direct result of this \nthe resulting characteristic contact angle for the rougher samples increases; for instance, the 50 \u03bcm \ntrench pattern (A3), with the maximum Sa of 0.636 \u03bcm and lowest \u03b3P of 12.24 mJm-2 gives the largest \ncontact angle of 66.0\u00b0. Current theory states that for a flat hydrophilic surface an increase in \nroughness ought to result in the contact angle effectively decreasing [26]; however, as one can see \nfrom Table 1 this is not the case in this work for the hydrophilic nylon with contact angles with the \n 9 \nreference contact angle being 56.4\u00b0 (A1). This can be explained by the likely existence of a mixed \nCassie-Baxter\/Wenzel state wetting regime, in which both Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter regimes are \npresent over the solid-liquid interface [27-30]. That is the surface roughness along with the induced \npattern yields a water droplet which is held in an intermediate state such that both wetting regimes \ncoexist. This mixed wetting regime arising can also account for the observed reduction in apparent \u03b3P \nand increase in contact angle owed to the laser induced topographical pattern on the hydrophilic nylon \n6,6 samples. Another factor which can be taken from Table 1 is that the hatch patterns (B1 and B3) \ngave rise to smoother surfaces in comparison to the trench patterns (A3 and B2). The reasoning \nbehind this result is believed to be on account of the beam overlapping the same irradiated area \nnumerous times during laser processing. This allowed the material to remelt, causing the resolidified \nmaterial to become smoother as the sample surface cools. It should be noted here that the laser \nirradiated surfaces have higher errors for the contact angle measurement owing to the fact that surface \ntopography would have affected how the liquid formed an equilibrium state on the material surface. \nTo analyse the extent of the polar component\/surface energy and surface roughness being a driving \nforce on the contact angles, graphs of contact angle as a function of polar component\/surface energy \n(see Figure 3) and Sa\/Ra (see Figure 4) were drawn. \n \nOne can see from Figure 3 that the contact angle appears to have good correlation in conjunction to \nthe two apparent surface energy components such that the recently advancing contact angle is a \ndecreasing function of the apparent \u03b3P and \u03b3T.  This coincides with current theory which states that the \ncontact angle will decrease upon an apparent increase of the surface energy components that have \nbeen graphed in Figure 3 [4]. From this result one can extrapolate that the resulting contact angle for \nthe laser surface treated nylon 6,6 is highly dependant on the apparent \u03b3T and \u03b3P and by knowing how \nlaser treatment affects the surface energy of a polymeric material this could allow for a pre-\ndetermined contact angle to be achieved. In a similar manner, a graph of contact angle against the \nsurface roughness parameters Sa and Ra was drawn, as seen in Figure 4, to ascertain if any correlation \ncould be highlighted. \n \nDue to the surface topography having a large effect on the wetting regime taking place it was \nnecessary to analyse how the recently advancing contact angle varied over the different induced \nsurface roughness values. Figure 4 shows that there is a significant difference between how the \nsurface roughness parameters, Ra and Sa, relate to the recently advancing contact angle for triply \ndistilled water incident on the laser surface treated nylon 6,6 samples. The data given in Figure 4 \nallows one to see that the roughness parameter Ra has a Gaussian fit with the contact angle measured \ngiving a peak contact angle of around 65\u00b0 to be obtained with an Ra value of around 0.1 \u03bcm. In \ncontrast the Sa parameter gives a considerably different correlation such that contact angle remains \nconstant around 56\u00b0 for Sa values up to 0.3 \u03bcm at which point the angle begins to increase until it \n 10 \nfinally plateaus from Sa values of 0.4 \u03bcm and more with contact angles of approximately 65\u00b0. This \nshows that there could be some dependence on the two surface roughness parameters in determining \nthe contact angle; however, the resulting correlation does not appear to be as strong as shown with the \nsurface energy components as seen in Figure 3. Another factor that should be considered in this \ninstance is that the data given in Figure 4 does not necessarily coincide with current theory which \nstates that for a hydrophilic material an increase in roughness should reduce the contact angle making \nthe material more hydrophilic [4]. For both Ra and Sa parameters the contact angle increases from the \ninitial contact angle obtained with the non-irradiated reference sample which, as stated previously, is \nattributed to the mixed state wetting regime taking place due to the topography of the laser surface \ntreated samples. Having said that, it was observed using Figure 4 that the contact angle did decrease \nfor larger Ra values arising from the laser patterned samples which does coincide with current theory \nwhich states that, under certain conditions, the contact angle is a decreasing function of surface \nroughness [31]. Nevertheless, it may still be possible to estimate the contact angle to be achieved by \nusing the correlations that have been identified throughout this research. Following on from this, with \nthe aid of being able to estimate the contact angle this could feasibly help to produce surfaces that \ngive rise to enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation if the optimized contact angle or contact angle \nrange was known for the cell type that would be coming into contact with that specific material.     \n \nIn addition to surface energy and surface roughness the surface oxygen content of a material may \nhave an affect on the resulting contact angle and following on from this the surface oxygen content for \nselected samples were chosen; these samples were the as-received reference control sample (A1), 100 \n\u03bcm trenches (B3) and 50 \u03bcm trenches (B1). These samples were chosen as they were the limits in \nterms of the recently advancing contact angles measured. On account of this the data given in Table 2 \nindicates that the surface oxygen content may not be one of the main factors that gives rise to the \napparent increase in advancing contact angle as a rise in oxygen content should bring about a \nreduction in the contact angle as stated by Hao and Lawrence [5]. The slight rise in oxygen content \ncan be attributed to oxidation of the nylon 6,6 surface during laser surface treatment as the \nexperiments were carried out in ambient air. From the results shown in both Tables 1 and 2 the \nevident rise in contact angle can predominantly be a result of the reduction in the apparent \u03b3P on \naccount of the mixed state wetting regime taking place owed to the surface topography. With this in \nmind it can be seen that the surface topography in terms of roughness and pattern can have a large \neffect on the extent of which wetting regime occurs and directly effects the value of the apparent \u03b3P \nand \u03b3T. Therefore, the polar component along with the surface roughness\/topography can be seen to be \nthe main driving force to defining the characteristic contact angle as they both are closely linked to \none another in this instance.  \n \n \n 11 \n4.3 \u2013 Effect of Laser Irradiation on Osteoblast Cell Bioactivity \n \n4.3.1 \u2013 24 Hours After Seeding \n \nIt has been seen that the laser material interaction has given rise to a sufficient modification in terms \nof numerous surface properties and as such it can be noted that this could have a large impact upon \nhow the  osteoblast cells react to the nylon 6,6 samples. Figure 5 shows the optical micrographs for \nthe 6 Au coated samples 24 hours after cell seeding. \n \nIt can be seen in Figure 5 that for all samples the osteoblast cells have to some extent adhered to the \ndiffering surfaces. That is, the cells have firstly attached, adhered and have begun to spread across the \nsurfaces. The extent to which this phenomenon has taken place appears to be dependant on the laser \nprocessing owed to the larger areas of cell coverage after 24 hours of incubation time. For the trench \nand hatch patterns the cells have somewhat proliferated resulting in the larger cover densities with the \nlargest cell cover density being 37% for the 100 \u03bcm trench pattern which was considerably larger in \ncomparison to the as-received reference control sample which gave rise to a mean cover density of \n17%. It should also be noted here that from the micrographs shown in Figure 5 the laser treated \nsamples do not appear to give rise to directionality in terms of cell growth and proliferation. In fact \nthe cells seem to be growing in random directions in conjunction with the laser induced patterns. \nAdditionally, in terms of morphology of the cells the micrographs in Figure 5 show that most of the \nsamples gave rise to bipolar shapes, apart from the 100 \u03bcm trench pattern which was at a more \nadvanced stage of the cell growth process. This could indicate that the growth process on the nylon \n6,6 samples begins with a bipolar morphology and progresses to a more radial morphology as the \nincubated time progresses.  To confirm what had been observed in the micrographs shown in Figure 5 \nthe samples where analysed using SEM. The SEM images of each sample are shown in Figure 6. \n \nThe SEM images obtained in Figure 6 allowed one to confirm that the osteoblast cells were already at \nan advanced stage in terms of cell growth on the nylon 6,6 samples. This is owing to the cells \nbeginning to spread over the sample surfaces. Also, both the micrographs and SEM images show that \nfor all samples a number of cells had spread completely, forming numerous filopodias. In contrast to \nthe micrographs in Figure 5, Figures 6(b) and (c) indicate that there may possibly be some \ndirectionality to the cell growth which is dependant on the surface topography; however, this is not \nconclusive and the non-directionality may well be a result of the relatively shallow peak heights \nforming the patterns which was determined in the profile extractions (see Figure 2) during the \ntopography analysis. From Figures 5 and 6 it can be seen that the morphologies of the cells on each of \nthe different samples are similar to one another which could indicate that the cells reacted in the same \nmanner for each sample. However, it could have also potentially taken more than 24 hours to affect \n 12 \nthe morphology of the cells and was considered when analysing the samples after the 4 day incubation \nperiod which will be discussed later. In addition, the SEM images shown in Figure 6 show that in \nsome cases a bipolar morphology arises; however, the radial nature of the cell growth becomes more \napparent on each of the samples when comparing the images in Figure 6 to those in Figure 5. This \nresult also is an indicator to the fact that the cells in this instance do not have directionality owed to \nthe laser-induced surface pattern.     \n \nIn order to quantify how the osteoblast cells reacted to the different surface topographies the cell \ncover density was measured for each of the samples. A histogram showing the cover densities can be \nseen in Figure 7. In order to determine a mean value for the cover density four values were obtained \nfrom micrograph and SEM images.  \n    \nThe histogram given in Figure 7 shows that the mean cover density after 24 hours was larger for all \nlaser irradiated samples in comparison with the as-received reference control sample. The largest \nmean cover density of 38% was achieved with the 100 \u03bcm trenches pattern, whilst the lowest was \n17% for the as-received reference control sample. The 50 and 100 \u03bcm hatch patterned samples gave \nthe lowest cover densities of 23 and 34%, respectively in comparison to the other laser patterned \nsurfaces and can be owed to the roughness of these samples being less than the trench patterned \nsamples. As a direct result of the mean cover density results shown in Figure 7 one can deduce that \nthe laser surface modification implemented gave rise to an increase in proliferation, speeding up the \ncell growth process as a result of allowing the material to become more biomimetic by changing the \nsurface characteristics. \n \n4.3.2 \u2013 4 Days After Seeding \n    \nWith the 24 hour experiments showing that the cells had attached and begun to spread it was \nnecessary to carry out analysis on the nylon 6,6 samples which had been seeded and incubated for 4 \ndays to ensure that the cells where still adhered to the samples and that the spreading was still taking \nplace. Figure 8 shows the optical micrographs obtained for each of the samples. \n \nAs one can see from Figure 8, after 4 days of incubation the cells were at an advanced stage of growth \nin comparison to the samples that had been incubated for 24 hours. This is due to the fact that all of \nthe images in Figure 8 show that the cells have covered almost all of the surfaces of each sample with \nthe least covered being the as-received reference control sample. This coincides with what was \nobserved previously with the 24 hour incubated samples as the as-received reference control sample \ngave the least cover density in both instances. In addition it was also realized that the morphology of \nthe osteoblast cells were very different when comparing each sample which had been left incubated \n 13 \nfor 4 days. That is, the as-received reference control sample (see Figure 8(a)) produced a spindle-like \nradial morphology, the 50 \u03bcm trench\/hatch (see Figures 8(b) and (d))  and 100 \u03bcm trench\/hatch (see \nFigures 8(c) and (e)) gave rise to a clumped radial morphology but to varying extents on each of the \ndifferent surfaces. This could be of a direct result of differing topographies between the different \npatterned samples as stated by Liang and Lawrence [5]. It should also be noted that similar to the 24 \nhour seeded samples the 4 day seeded samples did not appear to show any directionality in terms of \ngrowth and proliferation; however, for the 4 day seeded samples this may be due to the fact that every \nsample was tending towards 100% cover density. Again, for confirmation of what was observed with \nthe micrographs shown in Figure 8 SEM images were taken, as can be seen in Figure 9. \n \nFrom Figure 9 it is evident that the cells had rapidly begun to proliferate over the 4 day incubation \nperiod such that for all of the samples the cover density was tending towards maximum 100% cover \ndensity. The SEM images also showed that the cell growth was faster for the laser-induced trench and \nhatch patterns (see Figures 9(b, c, d, e)) in comparison to the as-received reference control sample. \nUpon closer inspection using the SEM as can be seen with the images in Figure 10, confirmation of \nthe morphologies was carried out. From these images it was found that the as-received reference \ncontrol sample (see Figure 9(a)) gave rise to a more coral-like morphology rather than spindle-like \nwhich was first thought with the micrographs shown in Figure 8. The 50 \u03bcm trench patterned sample \n(see Figure 9(b)) shows that the cell morphology was more clumped, spindle-like and was growing in \na radial nature. The 100 \u03bcm trench patterned sample (see Figure 9(c)) was seen to produce a clumped \nradial cell morphology. Whereas the two hatch patterns (see Figures 9(d) and (e)) confirmed that the \ncell morphologies where clumped radial with the 50 \u03bcm trench pattern (see Figure 9(d)) appearing to \nbe more coral-like.  \n \nThe results in Figure 10 show that, on average, for each sample the cover density was approximately \ntending towards 100% thus allowing for no statistical significance to be obtained from the plotted \ndata. This also implies that the seeded osteoblast cells over 4 days had covered all the surfaces of each \nsample regardless of how the surface was treated. Having said that, it should be noted that for the 100 \n\u03bcm hatch patterned sample each image used to calculate the cover density gave 100% covered \nresulting in the error being 0, as shown in Figure 10. There could therefore be some slight correlation \nbetween how the nylon 6,6 was treated prior to seeding and how the osteoblast cells react to the \nsamples in vitro, although in reality no discernable relationship could be deduced from the data shown \nin Figure 10. As a result of the equivalent cover densities a cell count was also taken after the fourth \nday of incubation which can also be used to analyse how the cells react to the different patterned \nsamples.  \n \n 14 \nA graph of cell density count as a function of pattern can be seen in Figure 11 which indicates that \nthere was a higher cell count after 4 days incubation for the trench and hatch patterns in comparison \nwith the as-received reference control sample. This further suggests that the surface pattern\/roughness \nhad a significant effect on the cell response in terms of cell cover density and growth. Also, as \nevidenced by the different cell morphologies (see Figures 5, 6, 8 and 9), surface roughness does have \na large influence on cell signaling in accordance with Nebe [32]. But, no discernible correlation \nbetween the cell density count and surface characteristics such as roughness and surface energy \nparameters could be determined in this instance, which could suggest that other factors might be in \nplay such as surface charge or even suggest that a number of different parameters are contributing to \nthe osteoblast cell response. Although it has been seen throughout this study that surfaces which have \nbeen almost fully treated with the CO2 laser beam give rise to improved cell adhesion, proliferation \nand as such promotes a better interface for mitosis to take place.   \n \n5 \u2013 Conclusions \n \nThrough this study it has been determined that following CO2 laser processing of nylon 6,6 the \nsurface characteristics can be modified in order to have influence over the recently advancing contact \nangle. From analysing the laser induced patterned surfaces it was found that the surface energy and \npolar component had decreased by up to 7 mJm\n-2\n and the surface roughness had considerably \nincreased. It was found that the apparent polar component and total surface energy for the samples \nstudied were both a decreasing function of the characteristic advancing contact angle, which \ncorrelates with current theory; however, current theory states that the contact angle for a hydrophilic \nsurface should decrease upon increasing surface roughness which has not been seen throughout this \nexperimentation. This can be attributed to an intermediate mixed Cassie-Baxter\/Wenzel regime, in \nwhich both Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter regimes arise at the solid-liquid interface as a result of the \nformation of the water droplet on the various laser modified surface topographies. Another factor \nwhich has been taken in to account is that the surface oxygen content tended to increase by up to 2% \nAt. as a result of the laser processing. This is owed to the thermolytical interaction between the nylon \n6,6 material and the CO2 laser light that gives rise to melting of the nylon surface allowing oxidation \nto take place. From the results obtained it was found that the apparent surface energy and its \ncomponents were the most dominating parameter in the modification of wettability which was a result \nof the mixed state wetting regime owed to the surface topography produced from the different laser-\ninduced patterns.  \n \nFrom the results obtained it was not possible to develop a discernable correlation between the cell \nresponse and surface characteristics such as roughness and surface energy. This is due to the fact that \na number of factors come in to play which hold the ability to influence how the osteoblast cells \n 15 \nreacted to the nylon 6,6 in vitro. It has been seen that for all CO2 laser surface treated nylon 6,6 \nsamples osteoblast cell response has been improved to become more efficient, allowing cell growth to \nbecome quicker. This has been seen through the fact that the cells have covered more area of the \nnylon 6,6 samples after 24 hours and that the cell density count had increased after 4 days in \ncomparison with the as-received reference control sample. This implies that laser patterned surfaces in \nthis instance gave rise to enhanced biomimetic properties for nylon 6,6 in terms of osteoblast cell \nresponse. This response has been observed by instigating cell signaling which has been identified \nthrough variations in cell differentiation between each of the samples studied. It has also been \nobserved that all samples incubated over 4 days gave rise to large cover densities of around 100% \nregardless of laser surface treatment. In terms of morphology the cells were similar to one another \nwhen observed using both optical microscopy and SEM after 24 hours incubation, appearing to have \nmore of a bipolar nature. After 4 days the difference in cell morphology became more apparent, with \nthe cell growth showing differing morphologies such as coral-like for the as-received reference \ncontrol sample and clumped radial growth for the 50 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm hatch patterned samples. This \nfinding can be accounted for by the variation in surface energy and topography instigating cell \nsignaling, which has a major influence on cell morphology. Significantly, it has been seen that over 24 \nhours and 4 day incubation periods the 50 and 100 \u03bcm trench patterns gave rise to improved cell \nresponse, having greater cell cover density and mean cell count density in comparison with both the \nhatch and as-received reference control samples. It was evident from this finding that the trench \npatterns gave rise to preferential adhesion and cell signaling.  \n \n6 \u2013 Acknowledgements  \n \nWe would like to thank our collaborators Directed Light Inc., East Midlands NHS Innovation Hub, \nNobel Biocare and Photomachining Inc. for all of their much appreciated support.
