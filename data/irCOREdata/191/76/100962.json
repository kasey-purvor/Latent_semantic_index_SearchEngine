This re-\nduction (of about 0.1 eV per % of N for ) occurs be-\ncause of a band anticrossing (BAC) interaction between the con-\nduction band edge and a higher-lying nitrogen resonant band [2]\nand dramatically changes the electronic structure [3], thus of-\nfering a new route to band structure engineering and improved\nManuscript received February 26, 2003; revised July 30, 2003.

In particular, the growth of strained\nInGaAsN\/GaAs QW structures allows the benefits of compres-\nsive strain and of growth on a GaAs substrate. In addition, the\ninclusion of N in the InGaAsN layers increases the conduc-\ntion band offset, leading to improved electron confinement and\nto decreased electron spill out at room temperature and above,\nwhen compared with conventional InGaAsP 1.3- m lasers. Al-\nthough edge-emitting and VCSEL laser structures with impres-\nsive characteristics have already been reported [4]\u2013[6] the in-\nfluence of N on the electronic structure and laser characteristics\nhas not yet been fully elucidated.\nIn this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive theoretical\nand experimental analysis of the electronic structure of dilute\nnitride alloys, and the consequences of that electronic structure\nfor 1.3- m laser emission. We begin in the next section by in-\ntroducing the ten-band Hamiltonian used to calculate the\nband structure of InGaAsN heterostructures. After describing\nthe gain model that we use, we discuss the effect of nitrogen on\nband alignments in strained heterostructures, refining the band\nstructure parameters by comparison with photoreflectance mea-\nsurements. This analysis provides us with a suitable framework\nin which to calculate the gain and spontaneous emission charac-\nteristics of ideal InGaAsN laser structures. We analyze the influ-\nence of nitrogen incorporation on the calculated dipole matrix\nelements, electron effective mass, strain, gain versus carrier con-\ncentration and radiative current characteristic, as well as its in-\nfluence on differential gain. We then apply the model to analyze\nthe measured characteristics of two sets of 1.3- m InGaAsN\nlasers, one set with a single quantum well (SQW) and the other\nwith a triple quantum well (TQW) active region. By comparing\nthe calculated and measured spontaneous emission spectra we\nfound that a secant-hyperbolic line broadening function gave a\ngood description of the experimental spectra, and extracted the\ntemperature dependent broadening energy which provides the\nbest fit between the measured and calculated radiative currents\nat threshold. We then used this information to deduce the car-\nrier concentration at threshold, , for both devices and its de-\npendence on temperature. We use the calculated value of in\nconjunction with experimental measurements to analyze the rel-\native contributions to the threshold current of radiative recom-\nbination and of nonradiative monomolecular and Auger-related\nrecombination processes. We show that the monomolecular, ra-\ndiative and Auger coefficients are the same for both lasers, and\nthat the threshold current at room temperature is dominated\nby monomolecular, defect-related recombination. Finally, we\nbriefly compare the theoretically estimated laser characteristics\nof InGaAsN-based and conventional InGaAsP-based 1.3- m\nlasers.\n1077-260X\/03$17.00 \u00a9 2003 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

THEORETICAL METHOD\nA. 10 Band Hamiltonian\nThe and envelope function methods are widely applied to\nstudy III-V semiconductor heterostructures [7]. In this section,\nwe extend the well-established 8 band Hamiltonian [8]\nby introducing two additional spin degenerate nitrogen-related\nstates. The strong interaction between the N resonant states and\nthe conduction band edge means that the conventional 8-band\nmethod cannot be applied to InGaAsN and related het-\nerostructures. We must include the interaction between the N\nresonant states and the conduction band edge to describe the\nvariation of the (zone-center) conduction band edge energy with\nN. This leads to a modified ten-band Hamiltonian for In-\nGaAsN as shown in (1) at the bottom of the page, where we\nonly show the upper triangular block because the matrix is Her-\nmitian. The matrix elements\n(2)\nare the same as in the conventional 8-band Hamiltonian, where\n, and the subscripts CB, HH, LH, and SO stand for\nconduction, heavy-hole, light-hole, and split-off bands, respec-\ntively. The nitrogen resonant band is labeled by N, with\n(3)\nwhile\n(4)\ndescribes the coupling between the N states and the conduction\nband edge, including its dependence on nitrogen composition,\n. The parameter\nare\nmodified Luttinger\u2013Kohn parameters, the magnitude of\nthe spin-orbit splitting at , and\nis the Kane matrix element for the conduction band\nwhere indicates a CB Bloch\nstate of -like symmetry and is a valence band state, with\ncharacter ( or ), and is the host material\n(unperturbed) energy gap. and\ndescribe the influence of the\nhydrostatic and shear strain components on the band structure,\nwhere are hydrostatic deformation potentials (with index\nN, CB, and VB for nitrogen, conduction and valence band\nrespectively); and are elastic constants, the axial\ndeformation potential and is the strain in the layer plane.\nThere are far more N-related parameters in the Hamiltonian\nof (1) than can be accurately determined experimentally.\nSymmetry arguments indicate that the matrix elements\nand should vary linearly with , coupling the N level to\nthe valence band. The tight-binding (TB) calculations\nprovide a guide as to which are the most important parameters\n[9], [10]. We find that the dominant terms are those which are\nindependent of , and included in (1) to describe the variation\nof the overall energy gap with N composition.

Gain Model\nThe laser gain is calculated using a model based on density\nmatrix theory [11], [12]. The gain and spontaneous emission\nspectra are given by\n(5)\n(6)\nrespectively, where is the - and subband-dependent\noptical dipole matrix element for allowed electron-hole transi-\ntions, is the quantum well (2D) density of\nstates, and the Fermi function for electrons (holes). We\nused a secant-hyperbolic function to model the line broadening\nof the spontaneous emission and gain spectra [13]\n(7)\nwhere is the line broadening. The calculated spon-\ntaneous emission spectra at threshold were fitted to measured\nspectra between 30\u2013300 K. We found better agreement between\nexperiment and theory using the sech function rather than the\nLorenzian function commonly used to model line broadening\nin semiconductor lasers. The threshold gain was determined\nby substituting appropriate experimental and calculated values\n(as described later) into the formula\n(8)\nwhere is the optical confined factor, the internal losses,\nthe cavity length and the reflectivity of the mirrors.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nWe review here how we derive the band structure parame-\nters, Section III-A, before presenting calculations of QW band\nstructure in Section III-B. We present gain calculations in the\nfollowing Section III-C, where we derive general conclusions\nabout the gain characteristics of InGaAsN 1.3- m lasers. The\nresults of the gain calculations are then used to inform the anal-\nysis of real devices in Section III-D.\nA. Band Lineups\nThe values of the conduction and valence band offsets\nhave a significant influence on the carrier confinement and\nthe gain characteristics of semiconductor quantum well laser\nstructures. As an example, carrier spillover into the conduction\nband decreases the differential gain in InGaAsP\/InP 1.3- and\n1.5- m lasers [14]. There is still debate concerning the band\noffset ratios in InGaAsN\/GaAs QW structures. Although a type\nII band alignment was originally proposed for GaAs N\nheterojunctions, based on band offsets calculated using the\nFig. 1. Band edge lineup for In Ga As N pseudomorphically\nlattice matched on GaAs.\ndielectric model [15], more recent first-principles calculations\n[16] as well as three independent experimental techniques:\ntime-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, PL\npolarization, and optically detected cyclotron resonance [17],\nstrongly supported a type I alignment.\nWe have fitted the input parameters for our band structure\ncalculations to photoreflectance (PR) spectra from a range of\nInGaAsN\/GaAs quantum well (QW) samples. The parameters\nderived for the quaternary alloys are consistent with more ex-\ntensive measurements on GaAsN\/GaAs heterostructures [18].\nFor band structure calculations, we assume that the energy of\nthe nitrogen level , conduction , and valence band\nedge energies at the point all vary linearly with N composi-\ntion relative to the valence band maximum of the GaAs barrier\n. We assume for InGaAs N that\n(9)\n(10)\nwhile the resonant state energy, was set at\n(11)\nwhere the superscript refers to the well (barrier) layers,\nrespectively, is the energy separation between the\nnitrogen resonant level and the bottom of the host material\nconduction band, and and determine the variation of the\nInGaAs N energy gap with composition, , while gives\nthe chemical valence band offset, describing how the valence\nband edge of unstrained InGaAs N shifts on an absolute\nenergy scale with respect to that of a GaAs barrier [18]. For\nIn Ga As N , we first use model solid theory [19] to de-\ntermine the relative band alignment and the valence band offset\nof the In Ga As well material relative to GaAs, and\nthen use (9)\u2013(11) to introduce the band offset variation with N\ncomposition, .

Finally, indicates how the CB edge is shifted\ndownwards due to its interaction with the N resonant states.\nWe assume , consistent with our previous analysis of\nGaAsN\/GaAs structures [18], and also choose the same value\nof as in GaAsN to describe the variation of the VB band\noffset with nitrogen content in InGaAsN. Previously, we have\nanalyzed three wide GaAs N \/GaAs QW samples, with well\nwidth nm [18], where we observed a large number\nof transitions in each sample, despite the built-in tensile strain,\nand consistent with heavy-hole confinement in the VB due to the\nincorporation of nitrogen [18]. By changing the value of the va-\nlence band offset parameter in our model, and comparing the\nnumber and energy of the experimentally observed transitions\nwith allowed e -hh and e -lh transitions calculated by our\nten-band model we conclude that the value of should be\nat least 3.5 eV. This agrees with an earlier estimate of % %\nfor the valence band offset obtained by tracking the e1-lh1 and\ne1-hh1 crossover in narrow GaAsN QWs [20].\nB. Quantum Well Band Structure\nFig. 2(a) shows experimental room temperature photo-mod-\nulated reflectance (PR) measurements of a piece of as-grown\nwafer of a dilute-N InGaAsN SQW structure [21]. One of the\nlaser devices studied in this paper was fabricated from the same\nwafer (see Section III-D). By matching the measured and cal-\nculated QW transition energies in this, and a range of similar\ndilute-N InGaAsN structures as a function of pressure [22], we\nhave deduced the N-related input parameters for our band struc-\nture calculations. We set eV, eV. was\ncalculated using the tight-binding method, which includes the\neffect of different nitrogen nearest neighbor environments, and\nwas found to vary with N composition, , as\neV [23]. This dependence is consistent with other recent exper-\nimental work for high indium content samples, [24] but signif-\nicantly weaker than that reported previously for samples with\nlower In content between 0 and 0.08 (where varied from\nto eV) [25], [26]. We assumed the energy sepa-\nration between the N level and the bottom of the host material\nCB to be independent of indium composition in unstrained In-\nGaAsN, eV [10], [23].\nMatching theory with the experimental results at in\nFig. 2(a) we have used the full ten-band model to predict\nthe band structure and dispersion of the confined energy levels\nin the SQW laser, as shown in Fig. 2(b). A strong nonparabol-\nicity is clearly visible in the CB dispersion, due to its interaction\nwith the N-resonant level, which also results in a strong deep-\nening of the CB well. The well CB edge would be at 1.203 eV\nif (all energies are given relative to the VB edge in the\nGaAs barrier material), but the strong N-CB interaction pushes\nit down significantly, to a value of eV, Fig. 1,\nleading to a conduction band offset of meV.\nAt room temperature, the energies of the first QW confined CB\nstate, and the quasi-Fermi level at the threshold carrier con-\ncentration cm , are calculated to be 62\nand 122 meV above , respectively. The energy difference be-\ntween and the GaAs barrier CB edge is meV. This\nlarge offset should ensure negligible probability of electron oc-\ncupation in the barriers at room temperature. Thus, in spite of\nthe large volume of the GaAs barrier, and separate confinement\nheterostructure (SCH) layers, the carrier density in these layers\nis negligible. Also, the inclusion of 1.7% of N reduces the QW\ncompressive strain (with respect to InGaAs with %)\nfrom % to %.\nC. Gain Characteristics of Ideal InGaAsN QW Laser\nWe reviewed that the band structure of InGaAsN\/GaAs\nheterostructures differs significantly from that of conventional\nIII-V heterostructures, due to the band anti-crossing interaction\nbetween the N resonant states and the conduction band edge.\nWe turn here to investigate the consequences of that coupling\nfor optical gain and lasing in ideal InGaAsN\/GaAs QW lasers.\nWe compare first the gain characteristics of an ideal InGaAsN\n1.3- m laser with an equivalent N-free structure, showing\nthat the incorporation of N modifies the variation of gain with\ncarrier density, but not with radiative current density. We then\nconsider specific InGaAsN-based QW structures, from which\nwe conclude that optimum performance is likely to be obtained\nby minimizing the N content in a 1.3- m InGaAsN\/GaAs QW\nlaser. These calculations will then inform our discussion of real\ndevices in the next section.\nThe coupling between the N level and the conduction band\nedge modifies the conduction band wavefunctions and reduces\nthe interband optical transition matrix element com-\npared to a N-free conventional III-V alloy. Fig. 3 shows the\ncalculated variation as a function of in-plane wavevector for\nthe TE and TM interband matrix elements linking the first con-\nfined electron (e1) with heavy-hole (hh1) and light-hole (lh1)\nstates for an ideal 7-nm-wide In Ga As N \/GaAs\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The band edge, zone-center, TE matrix\nelement is calculated to decrease by % due to the incorpo-\nration of N. The nitrogen-conduction band coupling, therefore,\nleads to an increased conduction band edge effective mass. We\ncalculate that the band edge density-of-states effective mass in\nthe first conduction subband increases to for %,\nwhich represents % increase over that of the host material\n( for % and N-free QW).\nThe reduction in and consequent increase in the\nconduction band edge effective mass, causes the product\nto stay approximately constant, as would be ex-\npected from theory: the dominant contribution to the in-\nverse effective mass, , is directly proportional to .\nThe band structure and matrix elements presented in Fig. 3 were\nused to calculate the variation of material gain with temperature\nand as a function of carrier density and of radiative cur-\nrent density both in a In Ga As N \/GaAs QW\nstructure, and in an equivalent N-free structure [27]. The gain\nand spontaneous emission spectra were calculated using (5) and\n(6) with the intraband relaxation time assumed to have a\nconstant value in the ideal case of ps. We first de-\ntermined the electron and hole quasi-Fermi energies, and\nas a function of and . The increase in the conduction\nband effective mass leads to an increase in the carrier concen-\ntration at transparency for the In Ga As N \/GaAs\nQW laser structure and a decrease in the quasi-Fermi energy\nseparation for a fixed carrier concentration. As\na consequence the peak gain decreases at a fixed carrier den-\nsity in the In Ga As N structure when compared\nto an equivalent, N-free In Ga As\/GaAs QW structure,\nFig. 4(a). There is however a much weaker variation in the peak\ngain versus radiative current density, Fig. 4(b). This weak vari-\nation reflects the fact that for a fixed quasi-Fermi level separa-\ntion, the radiative current in a QW laser is approximately\nproportional to , where is the band edge\nreduced effective mass. Because the VB mass, , is always\nlarger than the CB mass , the reduced mass is deter-\nmined primarily by .

Like-\nwise, because of the reduced interband matrix element, there\nis little difference in the calculated gain as a function of radia-\ntive current density for the two structures considered, and the\ngain saturates at a similar level in the N-based and equivalent\nconventional N-free QW structures considered [Fig. 4(b)]. The\nincreased conduction band nonparabolicity also has little influ-\nence on the temperature dependence of the transparency carrier\ndensity for the dilute nitride structure considered, compared to\nthe equivalent N-free structure.\nWe see from Fig. 4(a) that the differential gain decreases\ndue to the incorporation of N. Small signal analysis of coupled\ncarrier and photon density rate equations shows that the reso-\nnance frequency in a semiconductor laser is proportional to\nthe square root of the differential gain: , where\nis the differential gain with respect to the carrier den-\nsity. We investigate in Fig. 5 how the differential gain varies\nwith N content. The addition of either In or N reduces the en-\nergy gap : In Ga As behaves as a conventional III-V alloy,\nwhile the addition of N reduces the gap due to a repulsive anti-\ncrossing interaction between N resonant states and the conduc-\ntion band edge [2], [3]. Because In atoms are larger than Ga\natoms, an In Ga As QW is compressively strained. By con-\ntrast, Ga-N bonds are about 20% shorter than Ga-As ones, so\nthat the built-in compressive strain decreases rapidly with in-\ncreasing N content. To find the optimal balance, we simultane-\nously changed the indium (In) and nitrogen (N) concentration,\nand , in a series of ideal 7-nm-wide QWs. In order to main-\ntain the QW ground state transition energy e1-hh1 constant at\n0.954 eV, in the range of nitrogen composition from % to\n%, we have calculated a decrease in In composition from\n55% to 30% [29]. We find that for a fixed broadening factor the\ncalculated differential gain decreases with increasing N content,\n, with the most rapid decrease observed at low . As expected,\nthe differential gain also decreases with increasing broadening\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:31 from IEEE Xplore.

Because the measured broadening in InGaAsN increases\nwith [18], we conclude that the calculated threshold\nvalue of cm for is only about 40%\nof the value which could be achieved in an ideal InGaAs 1.3- m\nQW laser. The initial rapid reduction in differential gain (al-\nready notable at the first data point, %) reflects the\nstrong coupling between the N resonant band and the conduc-\ntion band edge states, even at low values. The matrix element\n(and differential gain) continue to decrease (but less rapidly) as\nwe increase from 0.5% to 3%, over which range the calcu-\nlated compressive strain value also decreases from %\nto %. To highlight influence of N, we note that over the same\nrange of indium composition (from % to %)\nCorzine et al. [30] reported a less rapid decreasing in differen-\ntial gain (from cm to cm ) in N-free\nInGaAs QW lasers at transparency.\nThe carrier concentration at threshold increases with\nincreasing , primarily due to the increase in the CB effective\nmass and reduction in the interband transition-matrix element\nwhen N is added. By contrast, the variation of is much\nweaker, being almost independent of N content [29].

The N content can\nbe further reduced by using narrower QWs, and also by\ngrowing tensile-strained layers above and below the QW, as\ndemonstrated by Tansu et al. who achieved 1.3- m emission\nwith %, a quantum well width of 6 nm, and utilizing\nstrain-compensating GaAs P tensile layers in the barrier\nregion [32], [33].\nD. Temperature Characteristics of Real InGaAsN QW Lasers\nWe turn in this section to analyze the characteristics of\nactual InGaAsN laser structures, using the theoretical models\nand insights established in the previous sections. We consider\ntwo different laser structures [34]: first, a 6.4-nm-wide single\nquantum well (SQW) laser with In and N-content of about\n36% and 1.7%, respectively, and GaAs barriers; and secondly,\na three quantum well (TQW) laser structure with well width\n6.2 nm, % and %, separated by 25 nm\nIn Ga As N barriers grown lattice-matched to\nGaAs. The SQW samples were fabricated into 50 m-wide\nbroad area devices and the TQW samples into 4- m ridge\nwaveguide devices. The emission wavelength at RT for the\nSQW and TQW lasers was found to be 1270 and 1290 nm,\nrespectively.\nThe threshold material gain for the two structures was de-\ntermined using (8). We took the experimentally determined in-\nternal loss values cm and cm , respec-\ntively [35]; we calculated the optical confinement factor to be\n% (SQW) and % (TQW), with cavity lengths\nof m and m for the SQW and TQW\ncase respectively, giving a threshold material gain of\ncm and cm . We assume in our anal-\nysis temperature-independent internal losses.\nIn our experimental setup the spontaneous emission (SE)\nspectrum was collected via a window milled into the -contact\n(substrate) of the laser, using a silica-based 100- m-diameter\ncore multimode optical fiber and an optical spectrum analyzer\n(OSA). In this configuration, the integrated SE will not have\nundergone any significant amplification or absorption, and\nhence the collected pure SE will be directly proportional to the\nradiative current. By measuring the spontaneous recombination\nfrom a window in the substrate, we detect the spontaneous\nrecombination of electrons with holes having - or - like\n(TE) character, assuming negligible photon scattering. Radia-\ntive recombination via -like (TM) valence band states will\nnot be detected because the polarization vector is in the direc-\ntion of light collection. The resulting integrated SE rate would,\ntherefore, underestimate the total radiative current. However,\ndue to the large heavy-hole to light-hole\nsubband splitting (114 meV) in\nthese compressively-strained devices, the hole density in the\nlight-hole band is expected to be negligible .\nAlso the calculated ratio between the dipole matrix elements\nsquared of these two VB states with the first electron states in\nthe CB at is . From\nour SE analysis we calculate that recombination via light-hole\nstates resulting in SE of TM-like character is negligible com-\npared to the TE-like SE occurring via the heavy-hole states.\nHence, carrier recombination occurs via the heavy-hole band\nand is consequently of only - and -like character. We\ncan, therefore, be confident that the measured SE spectra are\nrepresentative of the total spontaneous recombination in the\ndevice.\nTo calculate accurately the dependence of the gain spectra on\ncarrier concentration and on temperature, we first compared the\nexperimentally measured SE spectra with those calculated using\nthe 10-band theory, including a sech line shape broadening\nfunction, (7), as shown in Fig. 6. The best fit to the spectra was\ngot by changing the temperature dependent broadening param-\neter from 6.6 meV to 17 meV in the temperature range from 30\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Fig. 7 shows how the calcu-\nlated material gain per QW varies as a function of carrier den-\nsity in the TQW structure at 300 K. Our gain spectra agree well\nwith those obtained using a full many-body theory, in which\nthe many-body spectra were convolved with a Gaussian line\nfunction to model the (inhomogeneous) broadening observed by\nHakki\u2013Paoli measurements in InGaAsN devices [36]\u2013[38].\nWe used data such as that in Fig. 7 to calculate the threshold\ncarrier concentration, , as a function of temperature for the\ntwo structures considered. The calculated variation of , pre-\nsented in Fig. 8, is higher for the SQW device, and increases\nmore strongly at high temperature then in the TQW device, due\nto the lower optical confinement factor and consequently higher\nthreshold material gain value.\nTo quantify the magnitudes of the monomolecular, radiative,\nand Auger recombination current paths throughout the struc-\nture we assume that the current injected into a laser operating\nat 1.3 m may be written as:\n(12)\nFig. 8. Calculated carrier density at threshold for SQW (squares) and TQW\n(dots) devices.\nFig. 9. Radiative current versus carrier concentration.\nwhere is the electronic charge, is the active region volume,\nis the monomolecular recombination coefficient which de-\nscribes recombination through traps and defects, is the radia-\ntive or bimolecular recombination coefficient associated with\nspontaneous emission, and is the Auger recombination coeffi-\ncient. Radiative recombination involves the recombination of an\nelectron in the conduction band with a hole in the valence band,\nresulting in the production of a photon. It is, thus, a two-carrier\nprocess and proportional to (for ) if Boltzmann statis-\ntics apply. In order to determine how well this relationship holds\nat the high injection levels observed in these devices we have\nplotted in Fig. 9, against carrier density on log scales for\nthe TQW laser. We evaluated that near threshold ,\nslightly lower than in 1.3- m InGaAsP lasers where the gradient\nis 1.87 [39].

We derived at room tem-\nperature that cm\nand cm . It should be noted that the\nvalues determined for the Auger coefficient are of similar mag-\nnitude to reported values of the Auger coefficient for 1.3- m\nInGaAsP-based devices, for which is typically in the range\ncm [45], [46]. This indicates that Auger re-\ncombination is also an important intrinsic recombination mech-\nanism in InGaAsN. In Fig. 10(b) we plot the total current density\nper well at threshold for the SQW device (open squares) and a\nTQW device (open circles). It can be clearly observed that the\nthreshold current in the SQW laser increases much faster with\ntemperature than in the TQW device. Note that here we have ne-\nglected the effect of current spreading around the narrow (4 m)\nridge in the TQW devices. Whilst accurate determination of the\ndegree of current spreading is complex, we can qualitatively un-\nderstand how it would affect our results. By neglecting current\nspreading we effectively overestimate the threshold current den-\nsity for the TQW ridge devices. This would make the differ-\nence between the TQW (ridge) and SQW (broad area) devices\nin Fig. 10 larger and hence would not affect our conclusions. As-\nsuming that the recombination coefficients determined are the\nsame in the SQW and the TQW device we can now use the cal-\nculated threshold carrier density, , of the TQW laser (from\nFig. 8) to plot in Fig. 10(b) the expected variation of with\ntemperature for the TQW laser (open circles). We observe very\ngood agreement, indicating that the different threshold carrier\ndensity of the SQW and the TQW devices can reasonably ex-\nplain the different temperature variation of the threshold current.\nWe estimated the contribution of three current paths to the\ntotal threshold current and find that in this material, defect-re-\nlated recombination is a significant current path over a wide\ntemperature range, accounting for 55% of the total at room tem-\nperature (RT). We have also determined the absolute values of\nall three current paths over the entire temperature range consid-\nered, and further estimate that at RT the radiative and Auger re-\ncombination currents account for 20% and 25% of the total, re-\nspectively. Our measured temperature variations of\nand are in good agreement with theoretical calculations\nbased upon a 10-band Hamiltonian. These results indicate\nthat by removing the defect-related current path, the threshold\ncurrent density could be approximately halved to values com-\nparable with traditional InGaAsP\/InP-based lasers making this\nmaterial very attractive for VCSELs and other integrated GaAs-\nbased devices.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe have presented a theoretical analysis of ideal and real\n1.3- m InGaAsN lasers. Our analysis shows that a 10-band\nHamiltonian can successfully describe the band structure in di-\nlute N-III-V structures. We predict that the addition of N reduces\nthe peak gain and differential gain at fixed carrier density in an\nideal dilute nitride QW structure when compared to an equiva-\nlent conventional structure. However, the gain saturation value\nand the peak gain as a function of radiative current density are\nlargely unchanged due to the incorporation of N. Our calcula-\ntions show that in order to maximize the differential gain and\nminimize the carrier concentration at threshold it is best to min-\nimize the N composition, in the QW, subject to critical thick-\nness constraints.\nFrom spontaneous emission measurements on real devices,\nwe determine the absolute values of the radiative and non-\nradiative current components over the entire temperature\nrange considered, and estimate that at room temperature the\nmonomolecular, radiative and Auger recombination currents\naccount respectively for 55%, 20%, and 25% of the total\nthreshold current. These results indicate a large defect-related\ncurrent contribution associated with the incorporation of ni-\ntrogen. In addition to nitrogen-related growth defects, possible\ncauses of this loss could be the formation of various nitrogen\nnext-neighbor configurations [47] or the incorporation of\nantisite defects [48], [49] due to the low growth temperature\nrequired for the InGaAsN alloy.\nComparing our theoretical results on InGaAsN\/GaAs\nwith previous theoretical analysis of 1.3- m InGaAsP\/InP\nstrained laser structures [50], we find that the In-\nGaAsN material has a higher differential gain for the\nsame amount of compressive strain\ncm versus cm ; optical gain\ncm cm versus cm ; and\nQW thickness nm cm versus cm ,\ndespite the significantly larger line broadening of 18 meV\nassumed in InGaAsN, compared to 6.6 meV in InGaAsP.\nFor another strong competitor at 1.3- m laser emission,\nInGaAlAs\/InP strained lasers, at room temperature theo-\nretical predictions suggest cm\n[51] while experimental measurements give a value of\ncm [52], for 1.46% compressively\nstrained 5-nm wells in a MQW structure, but at a significantly\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

At a comparable level of optical gain of cm\nand at room temperature, the differential gain in InGaAlAs\nfurther drops to cm [51]. For a slightly\ndifferent InGaAlAs structure, based on estimation from the\nrelaxation oscillation frequency, Ishikawa et al. reported a\nvalue of cm at room temperature [53]\nwhich is above the values for InGaAsP and InGaAsN lasers.\nThe use of an InGaAsN alloy can allow greater compressive\nstrain (up to 2.4%) compared to a typical InGaAsP\/InP struc-\nture (where %\u2013 % for 1.3- m emission and where\nat least 4 QWs are needed for successful operation) or com-\npared to a typical InGaAlAs\/InP structure (where is up to\n% for 1.3- m emission and where also MQW structures\nare needed for successful operation). Finally, InGaAsN also al-\nlows a deeper conduction band QW with stronger electron con-\nfinement, of benefit for higher temperature operation.\nAPPENDIX A\nFor completeness, Bloch basis functions of 10 band\nHamiltonian are provided as follows:\nThe set of states transforms to the set of states\n, under the application of time-reversal operator\nfor zinc-blende semiconductors, , where is the\nspin Pauli matrix which flips the spin component, is the com-\nplex conjugation operator, and is the inversion about midpoint\nbetween nearest neighbors . Due to this oper-\nator the system now posses Kramers symmetry.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank M. Kamal-Saadi, P. Klar, and\nA. Lindsay for useful discussions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
