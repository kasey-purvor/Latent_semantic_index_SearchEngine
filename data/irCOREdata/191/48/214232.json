A survey-\nbased study replicates a long-standing finding that perceptions of the likelihood of \ncriminal victimization predict levels of fear of crime. But perceived control and perceived \nconsequence also play two roles: (a) each predicts perceived likelihood; and (b) each \nmoderates the relationship between perceived likelihood and worry about crime. Public \nperceptions of control and consequence thus drive what Mark Warr defines as \u2018sensitivity \nto risk.\u2019 When individuals perceive crime to be especially serious in its personal impact, \nand when individuals perceive that they have little personal control over the victimization \nevent occurring, a lower level of perceived likelihood is needed to stimulate worry about \ncrime.  \n \nKey words: Fear of crime; risk perception; sensitivity to risk; personal vulnerability; \nprobability insensitivity. \n 3 \nBeginning an often cited paper on a somewhat plaintive note, Warr & Stafford (1983) argued \nthat one of the most disappointing features of research into the fear of crime was the lack of \ninvestigation into so-called \u2018proximate causes of fear\u2019 (meaning public perceptions of both \nthe likelihood and consequence of criminal victimization). Complicating the ascription of \nirrationality when levels of fear outweigh levels of statistically estimated risk, Warr\u2019s (1987) \n\u2018sensitivity to risk\u2019 model predicts that the influence of perceived likelihood on fear is \nmoderated by perceptions of crime seriousness. Warr found empirical support for the \nhypothesis that when people judged a crime to be especially serious, a lower level of \nperceived likelihood was needed to stimulate some level of personal fear. Individuals were \nmore \u2018sensitive\u2019 to a given level of perceived likelihood when they viewed the crime to be \nespecially serious in nature and consequence. \nIn a more recent study Chadee et al. (2007) considered some elements of the sensitivity \nto risk model. Yet rather than looking at the pivotal role of perceived seriousness of crime, the \nauthors instead speculated on the utility of an extensive body of psychological research into \njudgments under uncertainty. When judging the likelihood of uncertain events, people often \nemploy cognitive heuristics or \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 rather than follow principles of probability \ntheory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973).i One of these \u2018rules of thumb\u2019 \u2013 the availability heuristic \n\u2013 predicts that the size of a class tends to be judged by the ease with which instances of it can be \nretrieved from memory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Applied to fear of crime, the availability \nheuristic may help explain why people tend to over-estimate the probability of criminal \nvictimization, and particularly over-estimate the frequency of rare, spectacular and easily \nimaginable events (Warr, 1980). People substitute a relatively difficult question (how likely is it \nthat I will become a victim of a particular crime?) with a relatively easy question (how easy can \nI imagine becoming a victim of a particular crime?). \nThe findings of a London-based survey extend Warr\u2019s model of risk sensitivity in two \nways. First, when respondents judged crime to be especially uncontrollable, and when they \njudged crime to be especially serious in its consequence, a lower level of perceived likelihood \nwas needed to stimulate relatively frequent worry about crime. Perceptions of consequence and \ncontrol thus interacted with perceptions of likelihood to predict levels of worry about crime in \nthe sample. Second, respondents tended to see victimization as likely when they saw the \nconsequences to be severe and the event to be difficult to control. The availability heuristic \npredicts that vivid and easily accessible mental imagery (which in the current context may \ninvolve mental representations of highly uncontrollable, unpredictable and consequential \ncrimes) shapes perceptions of the likelihood of a given risk. The extended model of risk \nsensitivity hopes to incorporate notions of vulnerability and circulating representations of risk \ninto a more powerful framework on the dynamics of worry about crime. \n \nFEAR OF CRIME AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RISK  \nThe psychology of risk is an under-researched area in the fear of crime, yet insights can provide \nan important complement to the most extensive body of evidence: public perceptions of \nneighborhood breakdown and stability. Numerous studies have found that public concerns \nabout local disorder, social cohesion and collective efficacy predict fear of crime (e.g. Ferraro, \n1995; Perkins & Taylor, 1996; Jackson, 2004; and Wyant, 2008; for reviews see Hale, 1996; \nFarrall et al., 2009). Such work suggests that citizens link the risk of crime with levels of moral \nconsensus, social order and collective efficacy. If \u2018day-to-day\u2019 issues (\u2018young people hanging \naround\u2019, \u2018poor community spirit\u2019, \u2018low levels of trust and cohesion\u2019) generate information about \nrisk (Ferraro, 1995) and a sense of unease in one\u2019s environment (cf. Goffman, 1971; Warr, \n1990; Tulloch, 2003), then fear of crime emerges as a social indicator of public concerns over \nneighborhood breakdown, societal cohesion, moral consensus, and the pace and direction of \nsocial change (Jackson, 2006). Citizens may be expressing through the language of \u2018fear\u2019 and \n\u2018crime\u2019 a wealth of anxieties about social fragmentation, the loss of moral authority, and the \ncrumbling of interpersonal trust, daily civility and social capital (Girling et al., 2000).  \nTo this framework we might add the mechanisms that underpin subjective risk \nassessment. Consider Warr\u2019s (1987) \u2018sensitivity to risk\u2019 model. Simple yet powerful (Figure 1, \nleft box), at its most basic the model describes the relationship between perceived risk (defined \n 4 \nby Warr as the perceived likelihood of victimization and measured by Warr on a scale from 0 to \n10) and fear (measured by Warr via asking individuals how \u2018afraid\u2019 they are of falling victim on \na scale from 0 to 10). Assuming a linear relationship between perceived risk and fear, a \nregression line captures the three basic elements: the point at which a given level of perceived \nrisk stimulates a non-zero level of fear (threshold); the rate at which fear increases with \nperceived risk (slope); and the maximum level of fear that can be produced (maximum fear). \n \nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nAccording to the sensitivity to risk model the threshold and the slope (and therefore \nthe maximum) can vary according to the type of crime and how serious individuals judge that \ncrime to be (Warr, 1987). The threshold and slope can also vary according to social group. \nStudy after study has shown that women tend to report higher levels than men of fear of \nfalling victim of crimes such as physical attack or mugging (for general reviews of fear of \ncrime literature, see Hale, 1996, and Farrall et al., 2009). Warr (1985) found that women \ntended to see crimes as more serious than men partly because they tended to view certain \ncrimes as a prelude to more serious crimes (so-called \u2018perceptually contemporaneous \noffenses,\u2019 since one event is judged to covary with another event). This, he argued, explained \nwhy the intercept in the regression equation was often higher (depending on the type of \ncrime) for females than it was for males. \nWarr (1987) subsequently found that both the threshold and the slope for the linear \nrelationship between perceived likelihood and fear differed in a predictable way according to \nthe average perceived seriousness of the crime in question. Figure 1 (right box) summarizes \nsome of the data, where six regression lines model the linear relationship between fear and \nperceived likelihood for each of six criminal offences. As one moves from the bottom line to \nthe top line so this offence was judged by respondents to be of an increasingly serious nature. \nIn most cases the same level of perceived likelihood was unlikely to result in the same \namount of fear, with Warr (1987) explaining this in part by differential perception of the \nseriousness of crime.ii \nThe risk sensitivity model thus suggests (a) that some crimes are typically seen as more \nserious than other crimes, (b) that different people can come to different conclusions about the \nsame crime, and (c) that the interaction of individual levels of perceived seriousness and \nperceived likelihood in part generates the intensity of subsequent emotional response. Some \nindividuals may associate a type of crime with especially serious consequences because they \nfeel particularly vulnerable to the criminal event. They might, for example, associate burglary \nwith violence in part because they lack the ability to defend themselves, and believe they could \nbe a target of sexual assault in such a situation. But crucially, it is the subjective sense of \nseriousness and consequence that then leads to a subsequently heightened fear response, even \nwhen perceived probabilities are small, precisely because susceptibility and threat is believed to \nbe high (cf. Jackson, 2009). \nYet the mass media might also play a role in risk sensitivity. The media are the prime \nsource of information about the extent, nature and seriousness of crime in society. The most \ndramatic media reports are outliers: shocking but rare criminal events (cf. Stapel & Veltheuijser, \n1996; van Zomeren & Lodewijkx, 2009). An individual might, for instance, associate burglary \nwith violence in part because he or she receives striking reports of especially serious burglaries \nfrom the newspapers, television and other media. Circulating images of crime and risk may thus \nlead to widespread beliefs that the especially serious nature of crimes. If many people develop \ntheir own sense of risk shaped by common imagery of particularly frightening crimes, then it \nmay not be very surprising that many people worry about crime. By hearing about specific \nevents of crime that are brought home in a very vivid way \u2013 \u2018as if it could happen to me\u2019 \u2013 \npeople may then develop these personalized representations of the risk of crime, with all the \nattendant sense of high consequence, loss of control, and sense of likelihood (Jackson, 2006). \nRecall, however, that Warr (1985) found significant variation in perceptions of the \nseriousness of crime. Extending this to the impact of the mass media, people may selectively \nexpose themselves to information (Freedman & Sears, 1965). Already fearful of crime \u2013 and \n 5 \nalready feeling vulnerable \u2013 they actively seek out information. The resulting effect on public \nperceptions of risk may additionally depend on the nature and extent of local crime reports, with \npeople paying particular attention to reports that are according to Koomen et al. (2000: 923): \n\u2018\u2026sensational and self-relevant presentations of crime that are local, random, and sensational.\u2019 \nHeath (1984: 264) argues that sensational crimes \u2018achieve their spine-chilling quality from \neither severe violations of social norms or from violations of deeply engrained social norms.\u2019 \nShe found that reports of so-called \u2018sensational\u2019 crimes were associated with higher fear so long \nas the incidents were local (cf. Liska & Baccaglini, 1990), while crime reports that contained no \ninformation about the motive of the crime aroused more fear than if a motive was included. In \nStapel & Velthuihsen\u2019s (1996) study stronger responses were also elicited when the victim was \nsimilar to the participant.  \n \nExtending the risk sensitivity model \nThe objective of this paper is, then, to uncover some of the basic dynamics of risk perception in \nworry about crime. It is for future research to explore the characteristics of sensational and self-\nrelevant crime reports, to integrate an account of circulating representations of risk into the \nbroader explanatory framework (cf. Jackson, 2008). The present task is more modest. Extending \nWarr\u2019s work on risk sensitivity in two directions, the first contribution is to examine dual \ninteraction effects in which perceived control and perceived consequence each alter the \nobserved relationship between perceived likelihood and worry about crime (Figure 2). When \npeople judge crime to be especially serious in its personal effect, and when they feel they have \nlittle personal control over its occurrence, a lower level of perceived likelihood may be needed \nto predict a relatively frequent pattern of worry. Put another way, perceived likelihood becomes \nmore important in the production of emotional response when personal consequence is seen to \nbe especially high and when personal control is seen to be especially low. \n \nINSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nThere are parallels here to the \u2018psychometric paradigm\u2019 in risk perception research \n(Slovic, 2000), which shows that people are attune not just to the likelihood of a risk and the \nnumber of lives at stake, but also to qualitatively distinctive factors including whether a risk is \nseen to be catastrophic or \u2018dreaded\u2019 and a risk is seen to be uncontrollable, familiar and \ninvoluntarily incurred. The current study captures two elements at the heart of the \npsychometric paradigm in risk perception research \u2013 perception of consequence and \nperception of control \u2013 but it specifies them within a model of cognitive and affective \nappraisals of the risk of criminal victimization. The first two hypotheses are, more precisely, \nthat worry emerges when people view the risk of crime to be especially uncontrollable and \nespecially consequential in its personal impact, in part because only a relatively low level of \nperceived likelihood is needed to stimulate emotional response. \nThe second contribution relates to the effect of perceived consequence on perceived \nlikelihood and perceived control on perceived likelihood. Consistent with work on the \navailability heuristic, the third and fourth hypotheses are that viewing crime as highly \nconsequential and highly uncontrollable will be associated with judging victimization to be \nespecially likely. When people feel a relatively high level of control over risk, they may take \nadequate precautions, have good security provisions, feel able to \u2018read\u2019 the environment for \nsigns of trouble, and be able to deal with any encounters if they were to occur. There is a good \ndeal of evidence from psychological research that high perceived control is associated with \nlow perceived likelihood in various domains of risk perception (e.g. Hoorens & Buunk, \n1993). Yet, when people associate victimization with particularly dramatic and consequential \nevents, and when people see specific criminal acts as especially uncontrollable and \nunpredictable, they may also find it easier to imagine themselves becoming a victim, since \ntheir mental imagery of crime involves emotionally-arresting characteristics and scenarios. \nThe rationale for the third and fourth hypotheses is as follows. Individuals who see \nvictimization as difficult to control and especially strong in its impact are also expected to \nhold mental representations of risk that include dramatic and emotionally relevant imagery. \n 6 \nNisbett and Ross (1980: 45) suggest that vividness is core to the availability of information, \nand that vivid information is typically: \u2018(a) emotionally interesting, (b) concrete and imagery \nprovoking, and (c) proximate in a sensory, temporal, or spatial way.\u2019 Thus, a starting premise \nof this study is that events which are seen to be highly serious and extremely difficult to \ncontrol will be more likely to be cognitively represented using vivid and emotionally relevant \nimagery. Such imagery will then typically lead to heightened cognitive availability, it is \nassumed.   \n \nTHE STUDY \nResearch objectives \nWarr\u2019s model predicts that perceived likelihood of victimization will be more strongly \nassociated with fear of victimization among those people who judge the seriousness of crime \nto be high (compared to those people who judge the serious of crime to be low). His work \nthus hinges on a statistical interaction in which perceived seriousness \u2018moderates\u2019 (i.e. \nincreases or decreases) the strength of the relationship between perceived likelihood and \nworry about crime. This study tests four hypotheses by way of contribution: \n \nH1 Perceived consequence will moderate the association between perceived likelihood \nand worry about crime;  \nH2 Perceived control will moderate the association between perceived likelihood and \nworry about crime;  \nH3 Perceived likelihood will be positively associated with perceived consequence; \nand, \nH4 Perceived likelihood will be negatively associated with perceived control.  \nParticipants \nAs with Warr\u2019s work, observational data are used to test the core propositions. Data were \ncollected from a postal survey of residents of two neighbouring areas of London. A pure \nrandom probability sample of 1,800 registered voters was drawn from the UK Electoral \nRegister. Respondents were sent a questionnaire, and if this was not returned within 2 weeks, \na reminder letter (including duplicate questionnaire) followed. A raffle was also carried out \n(three prizes of \u00a350, \u00a325 and \u00a310). The achieved response rate was 27% (479 completed \nquestionnaires), with 33% in the first area (299 in Victoria Gardens) and 20% in the second \n(180 in Katherine House).iii \n Victoria Gardens is a wealthy and well-kept suburb with predominantly white and \nmiddle-class residents.iv According to local police statistics, Victoria Gardens has low \npersonal crime rates but a relatively high incidence of car crime. Katharine House is a high-\nrise, high-density, local authority housing estate with relatively high levels of personal crime \nand a significant amount of incivilities such as graffiti and young people causing noise and \nharassment. Katharine House is also an area with a good proportion of residents from low-\nincome brackets and a diverse ethnic mix.  \nYet the area in which respondents live is not considered important in this study, \nindeed the choice to survey these two neighborhoods was motivated by another research \nquestion. We know that perceptions of neighborhood breakdown and stability predict \nperceptions of risk (Ferraro, 1995; Farrall et al., 2009). Where people live may be important \nin explaining people\u2019s perceptions of social cohesion and decline that then shape perceived \nrisk, although people can come to quite different conclusions about the same environmental \nstimuli (Carvahlo & Lewis, 2003; Sampson & Raudenbush, 2004; Jackson, 2004; Franzini et \nal., 2008). In the current study it may be that Katharine House contains a greater \npreponderance of social and physical cues. Observers in Katharine House may then relate the \npresence of disorderly cues to a significant risk of victimisation, and this might help explain \noverall area differences in worry about crime. But the target here in this study is the inter-\nrelationships underpinning worry about crime and public perceptions of likelihood, control \nand consequence. Crucially, the psychological mechanisms linking cognitive appraisals of \n 7 \nrisk to emotional responses are assumed not to differ systematically among individuals who \nlive in the two neighbouring London areas.  \n \nMeasures \nTo measure worry about crime, respondents were asked how often (if at all) they had worried \nabout becoming a victim of each of seven crimes while in their neighborhood.v In order to get \nmore accurate self-reports, the time-period in question was specified to be the past month \n(Jackson, 2005). The seven crimes were: being attacked by a stranger in the street; being \nrobbed or mugged in the street; being harassed, threatened or verbally abused in the street; \nbeing pick-pocketed or having something stolen in a non-violent manner; having the home or \nproperty vandalised or defaced; having someone break into the home whilst the inhabitants \nwere there; and having someone break into the home whilst the inhabitants were away. \nResponse alternatives were: \u2018not once in the last month\u2019; \u2018once or twice in the past month\u2019; \n\u2018once or twice in the past week\u2019; and \u2018every day.\u2019 \nPerceived likelihood was measured by asking respondents how likely they thought it \nwas that they would fall victim of each of the seven crimes in their area (over the next 12 \nmonths). Three measurement strategies are used to elicit such subjective probabilities. The \nfirst is to generate numeric expressions of probability or odds; one might, for example, ask \nrespondents whether the pereived probability is 0.2 or 0.4 or 0.6, and so forth. The second is \nto use some kind of visual representation. One might for example provide a line labelled at \nthe end points as \u2018probability of zero\u2019 and \u2018probability of one\u2019 and ask respondents to draw a \ncross between these two points that represents their own estimated probability.vi Generating \nverbal expressions of uncertainty is the third option, and the one taken in the present study \nwith a seven-point scale labelled at the endpoints: 1 = definitely not going to happen and 7 = \ncertain to happen.  \nOn perceived consequence, respondents were asked how much they thought their \nlives would be affected by a typical instance of each of the categories of criminal \nvictimization, with a seven-point scale labelled at the endpoints (1 = not at all and 7 = to a \nvery great extent). Warr\u2019s (1987) study into risk sensitivity asked individuals how serious a \ngiven crime was. In making such a judgment it is conceivable that people draw on a number \nof issues including the impact on victims and society and the degree of moral culpability and \ntransgression involved in the act (Warr, 1989; cf. Rosenmerkel, 2001, and Alter et al., \n2007).vii The current study measures perceptions of the seriousness of the personal impact of \nvictimization (Jackson, 2009), which is assumed to invoke respondents\u2019 ability to cope with \nthe consequences, but also respondents\u2019 expectations about the nature and severity of \nrepresentative instances of various criminal acts. \nPerceived control was measured by asking respondents whether they felt able to \ncontrol whether they became a victim of various crimes in their area. A seven-point scale was \nused with only the endpoints labelled 1 = not at all;  and 7 = to a very great extent. Perceived \ncontrol over the risk of crime is assumed to comprise two things. The first is personal self-\nefficacy, i.e. feeling able to exert control over falling victim of crime, including being able to \nphysically defend oneself and take appropriate precautions to keep safe. The second is public \nbeliefs about the nature and characteristics of particular crime, e.g. whether a crime is seen to \nbe especially unpredictable, involving indiscriminate targeting, being mobile, volatile, with \nobscure motivation.viii  \n \nDescriptive statistics \nTables 1 and 2 provide summary statistics for the single indicators of each of the four central \nconstructs (worry about crime, perceived likelihood, perceived consequence and perceived \ncontrol). Inspection of the top-line findings showed that the majority of the sample had not \nworried once in the past month, whether about property crime (burglary and vandalism) or \npersonal crime (non-violent theft, physical attack by a stranger, harassment, and robbery). \nSomewhere between 4% and 13% of the sample reported having worried \u2018everyday\u2019 about \nfalling victim of each crime. These are frequency levels consistent with British Crime Survey \n 8 \nestimates of the frequency of worry across England and Wales (Gray et al., 2008; Farrall et \nal., 2009). \n \nINSERT TABLES 1 AND 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nTable 2 shows mean levels of perceived likelihood over the next 12 months (ranging \nfrom 2.62 for physical attack to 3.31 for burglary while the inhabitants are not at home), \nwhere 1 = \u2018definitely not going to happen\u2019 and 7 = \u2018certain to happen.\u2019 All the variables had a \npositively skewed distribution, with longer right tails found in the more serious crimes of \nburglary while the inhabitants are at home, physical attack in the street by a stranger, and \nbeing robbed in the street. For the same crimes there was also positive kurtosis, indicating a \nmore distinct peak near the mean, a more rapid decline, and larger tails compared to the other \ncrime categories. \nTurning to the perceived consequence measures, the mean ranged from 4.91 (non-\nviolent theft) to 6.23 (burglary while the inhabitants are at home) on a scale ranging from 1 to \n7 (where 1 = not at all and 7 = to a very great extent). All the items were negatively skewed, \nwith the longer left tails being found in the variables relating to the more serious crimes \n(burglary while the inhabitants are at home, physical attack in the street by a stranger, and \nbeing robbed in the street). This suggests agreement among the respondents about the severity \nof impact of these crimes (backed up by the same three crimes having high and positive \nkurtosis statistics). \nFinally, with the perceived control measures, the mean ranged from 3.15 (vandalism) \nto 4.68 (burglary while the inhabitants are at home) on a scale from 1 to 7 (where 1 = not at \nall and 7 = to a very great extent). There were relatively low levels of skewness in the \ndistribution of each variable. All the kurtosis statistics were negative, suggesting a flat top \nnear the mean rather than a sharp peak.  \n \nStatistical modelling  \nThe first step of analysis was to examine the relationship between perceived likelihood and \nworry about crime, and particularly to test a moderating effect of perceived consequence \n(hypothesis 1) and of perceived control (hypothesis 2). All variables were weighted factor \nscores that were rescaled to range from 0 to 10.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \nTable 3 shows the results of three linear regression models, with the frequency of \nworry about personal crime specified in each model as the response variable. Perceived \ncontrol and perceived likelihood both predicted levels of worry about personal crime, but \nperceived consequence did not (Model I). When adding the first interaction effect to the \nmodel (where the statistical effect of perceived likelihood on worry can differ according to \nlevels of perceived consequence), the interaction term was found to be statistically significant. \nSupporting hypothesis 1, the estimated average statistical effect of perceived likelihood on \nworry increased as perceived consequence increased. Figure 3 provides a more accessible \nvisualisation of the interaction effects relating to personal crime. Recall that the single \nindicators of perceived consequence were negatively skewed. The mean of the index was \naround 8 and the maximum was 10, and Figure 3 (top graphic) shows the fitted line \n(representing the estimated relationship between worry and perceived likelihood) where the \nperceived consequence index is 4, 6, 8 and 10. One can see that the slope of perceived \nlikelihood increased as levels of perceived consequence increased. Among individuals who \nsaw the personal consequences of victimization to be especially high, a lower level of \nperceived likelihood was needed to predict frequent worry about crime. \n \nINSERT FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \n 9 \nA second interaction effect was then added between perceived likelihood and \nperceived control. Again this was statistically significant. As feelings of perceived control \ndecreased, so the estimated average statistical effect of perceived likelihood on worry \ndecreased. This supports hypothesis 2. Because the perceived control index had a normal \ndistribution, fitted lines were provided for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Figure 3 (bottom graphic) \nshows that the slope of perceived likelihood increased as perceived control decreases.  \nWorry about property crime was also examined, although for reasons of brevity full \nfindings are not presented. But to summarize: as with personal crime, the interaction effects \nwere statistically significant, and the effect of perceived likelihood on worry increased as \nperceived control decreased and as perceived consequence increased.  \nTo test the third and fourth hypotheses, structural equation modelling (using MPlus \n5.2 and treating the indicators as ordinal-level variables) was used to estimate regression \npaths between the relevant latent variables; first for personal crime, and second for property \ncrime (Figure 4). This technique has the advantage of allowing a number of regression \nequations to be simultaneously estimated, meaning that paths to worry can also be included in \nthe statistical model. However, estimating interaction effects in structural equation modelling \nis a complex (and controversial) task, so interactions were not included here. Given that the \nstandard regression techniques above established interaction effects (Table 4), the parameter \nestimates relating to likelihood predicting worry should be interpreted as only the average \neffect of likelihood across all levels of (separately) perceived control and perceived \nconsequence. \n \nINSERT FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE \n \nStarting with personal crime, the fit of the model was good according to approximate \nfit indices (RMSEA=0.08, CFI=0.97, TLI=0.99) and not good according to exact fit statistics \n(\u03c72=173, 42 df, \u03c1<.001), although it is customary to focus on approximate fit indices (Hu & \nBentler, 1999). Because no structural paths were constrained, the fit statistics relate to the test \nof the measurement models. This indicates that the scales have adequate reliability, and that \nthe structure of the measurement model had some validity. This conclusion is strengthened by \nthe fact that the factor loadings (validity coefficients) of the worry indicators were all \nstatistically significant and of considerable magnitude (pick-pocket, \u03bb=0.78; physical attack, \n\u03bb=0.90; harassment, \u03bb=0.86; and street robbery, \u03bb=0.93), as were the factor loadings of the \nperceived likelihood indicators (pick-pocket, \u03bb=0.77; physical attack, \u03bb=0.92; harassment, \n\u03bb=0.85; and street robbery, \u03bb=0.89), the perceived consequence indicators (pick-pocket, \n\u03bb=0.79; physical attack, \u03bb=0.89; harassment, \u03bb=0.84; and street robbery, \u03bb=0.86) and the \nperceived control indicators (pick-pocket, \u03bb=0.75; physical attack, \u03bb=0.91; harassment, \n\u03bb=0.85; and street robbery, \u03bb=0.91). \nAll the coefficients relating to structural paths were statistically significant, apart \nfrom the path of perceived consequence to worry about personal crime. Replicating the results \nfrom Model I (Table 3), perceived likelihood was a strong predictor of worry and perceived \ncontrol was a moderate predictor of worry. Higher expected values of worry were associated \nwith judging likelihood of victimization to be high and personal control over the risk to be \nlow. Moreover, both perceived control and perceived consequence were moderate predictors \nof perceived likelihood. The more an individual saw the consequence to be severe and the \nmore an individual saw control to be low, the higher the expected value of perceived \nlikelihood. \nFor property crime, the fit of the model was good according to approximate fit indices \n(RMSEA=0.09, CFI=0.96, TLI=0.96) but not good in terms of exact fit (\u03c72=117, 25 df, \n\u03c1<.001). In fact a respectable fit was only achieved by allowing error terms to covary between \neach pair of the \u2018burglary in\u2019 and \u2018burglary out\u2019 indicators. This is justified by respect to \nmeasurement error, since respondents can plausibly have different expectations about \nburglary. As with personal crime, the factor loadings of the various indicators were also all \nstatistically significant and of considerable magnitude. All the coefficients relating to \nstructural paths were statistically significant, apart from the one relating to the path between \n 10 \nperceived consequence and worry about property crime. As with personal crime, perceived \nlikelihood was a strong predictor and perceived control was a moderate predictor of worry \nabout property crime. Again, higher expected values of worry were associated with judging \nlikelihood of victimization to be high and personal control over the risk to be low. Finally, \nboth perceived control and perceived consequence were moderate predictors of perceived \nlikelihood: the more an individual saw the consequence to be severe, and the more an \nindividual saw the control to be low, the higher the expected value of perceived likelihood. \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the psychology of risk in worry \nabout crime. The utility of differentiating between perceived likelihood, consequence and \ncontrol is demonstrated. While perceived likelihood was the judgment that most strongly \npredicted levels of worry about crime, perceived control and perceived consequence each had \nthree roles to play. First, each predicted perceived likelihood. Second, each predicted worry \n(with the exception of perceived consequence). Third, each moderated the strength of the \nassociation between perceived likelihood and the frequency of worry. Warr (1987) found that \namong people who judged crime to be especially serious, a lower level of perceived \nlikelihood was needed to stimulate a given level of personal fear. He argued that such \nindividuals were thus more \u2018sensitive\u2019 to a given level of perceived likelihood: \n \n\u2018\u2026the perceived seriousness of an offense affects fear by altering the functional \nrelation between fear and perceived risk (i.e., sensitivity to risk). Sensitivity to \nrisk in turn affects fear by determining the \u201coutput\u201d of fear produced by a given \n\u201cinput\u201d of perceived risk.\u2019 (Warr, 1987: 40). \n \nThe current investigation extends this finding. The greater the perceived consequence and the \nlower the perceived control, the stronger the observed association between perceived \nlikelihood and worry about crime. People worried even when they viewed victimization to be \nrelatively unlikely, so long as they saw the personal impact of the event to be high and\/or \ntheir personal control to be low.  \nTo explain why perceived control and perceived consequence might be associated with \nperceived likelihood, we can draw on research from cognitive psychology into why people \nroutinely over-estimate the probability of dramatic and salient events. There is a good deal of \nevidence from the psychological literature that high perceived control predicts low perceived \nlikelihood (see Skinner, 1996, for a review of the concept of perceived control). But the \navailability heuristic states that people judge the probability of an event partly on the ease with \nwhich they can imagine the event. Applied to worry about crime, cognitive representations of \nvivid and dramatic crimes may be characterised in specific mental models of risk as especially \nuncontrollable events with highly serious consequences. Crucially, respondents in the study \nmay have judged the likelihood to be relatively high partly because they found it relatively easy \nto personally imagine criminal acts and criminal events. Individuals might be substituting a \ndifficult question (how likely is it \u2026?) with an easy question (can I picture the event \u2026?). \n \nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH \nThis paper hopes to stimulate a program of psychological research into perception and the fear \nof crime. Citizens generate their own subjective risk estimates, which comprise the interplay \nbetween perceived consequence, likelihood and control. Combined with the fact that the media \nroutinely report rare but sensational criminal events, this may explain why many people worry \nabout crime and, indeed, why some individuals worry more than other individuals (through \nselective information seeking and prior feelings of personal vulnerability). Threats that seem \ndifficult to detect, that involve indiscriminate targeting, that are mobile, volatile and with \nobscure motivation \u2013 all these may be especially worry or fear provoking, in part because of two \nprocesses. The first is cognitive availability, since vivid social representations of crime may \nelevate the perceived likelihood of that event occurring. The second is through perceptions of \n 11 \npowerlessness and severe consequence interacting with perceived likelihood to stimulate \nrelatively frequent emotional response. \nThere are parallels here to \u2018probability neglect\u2019 in risk perception research (Sunstein, \n2003; Loewenstein et al., 2001; Rottenstreich & Hsee, 2001). Probability neglect predicts that \nwhen strong emotions are involved, people focus on the badness of the outcome rather than \non the probability that the outcome will occur. Sunstein (2003) argues that probability neglect \nhelps explain excessive public reactions to low-probability risks of catastrophe such as \nterrorist attacks. People who are already fearful of terrorism will focus less on the sense of \nprobability and more on the actual event. Vivid imagery of the event crowds out a more \ndispassionate sense of statistical chance. And while one may ask why someone is fearful in \nthe first place, probability neglect does suggest a simple mechanism by which fear is \nmaintained.  \nOn first glance the two notions \u2013 of risk sensitivity and probability neglect \u2013 diverge. \nWe are \u2018sensitive\u2019 to perceived likelihood but we are also \u2018neglectful\u2019 of perceived likelihood. \nYet in this observational study the empirical implications of the two models are actually \nidentical. It is just that the two underlying psychological processes are different. In both cases \npeople with high levels of emotion could view the likelihood to be relatively low when the \nconsequence is seen to be high. On the one hand, probability neglect states that this is because \nemotion crowds out rational assessments of likelihood, so perceived consequence takes over. \nOn the other hand, risk sensitivity suggests that once individuals associate a risk with high \npersonal consequence and low personal control, only a relatively small level of perceived \nlikelihood is needed to elicit a strong emotional response.  \nThe real issue here is what would happen to individuals for whom the perceived \nlikelihood of victimization increases over time. Would (for example) the manipulation of \nperceived likelihood lead to large shifts in emotion, as predicted by the risk sensitivity model? \nOr would heightened perceived likelihood lead to weak shifts in emotion, as predicted by the \nprobability neglect model? Observational data cannot be the arbiter here; experimental studies \nexert greater control and power to infer. If we are to integrate into existing explanations some \ncore aspects of the psychology of risk, future experimental work is best placed to answer \nquestions such as these, to help uncover some of the dynamics and mechanisms underpinning \nthis important social and political phenomenon of our day. \n \n 12 \nREFERENCES \nAlter, Adam L., Julia Kernochan, and John M.

Warr (1989) found that people tend to focus on one or the other evaluation, attending to the dominant feature \nof the crime. When crimes were seen as especially harmful, then the judgment of seriousness was heavily weighted by \nharmfulness. But when crimes were seen as especially wrong, then the judgment of seriousness was heavily weighted \nby wrongfulness. In a later study Alter et al. (2007) found that wrongfulness was dominant, however, although \nharmfulness was still a factor. \niii\n The samples cannot be viewed as representative of the two areas. Yet one typically worries about the \nrepresentativeness of a sample when one estimates more basic population attributes such as means or proportions. \nRelationships between constructs are arguably less susceptible to low response rates, and the relationships between \nthreat appraisal, vulnerability and emotion (for example) are unlikely to be specific to whether one lives in one \nadjacent area of London or another.  \niv\n Victoria Gardens and Katherine House are pseudonyms. \nv\n These measures are assumed to produce a more accurate reflection of the everyday experience of fear of crime \nthan standard measures such as \u2018How safe do you feel walking alone in your area after dark?\u2019 and \u2018How afraid are \nyou of being burgled?\u2019. Warr (2000: 434) differentiates between those fears \u2018aroused by an immediate danger, as \nwhen an individual is confronted by an armed attacker or is verbally threatened with harm\u2019 and those anxieties \nabout future or past events that result from an \u2018anticipation of possible threats or in reaction to environmental cues \n(e.g. darkness, graffiti) that imply danger.\u2019 He suggests that standards measures of \u2018fear\u2019 capture anxiety rather \nthan fear. Other researchers have employed to good effect measures of the past frequency of worry about crime \n(Jackson, 2004, 2005; Gray et al., 2008; Farrall et al., 2009). The current study takes this lead, by focusing on past \nevents of everyday worry, in order to more precisely measure specific previous instances of worry. \nvi\n Which is the best option for measuring the perceived likelihood of criminal victimization? Windschilt and Wells \n(1996) suggest that questions that use words or numbers to describe uncertainty encourage respondents to use one \nor two separate systems of reason: one based on associative, intuitive and automatic processes; the other on rule-\nbased, deliberate, controlled processes (cf. Sloman, 1996). One should therefore use words to describe probability \nwhen one assumes that individuals think about the given risk in one way, and use numbers to describe probability \nwhen one assumes that individuals think about the given risk in another way. The question for the current \ninvestigation is whether the risk of victimization is most often thought about using intuitive and non-rule based \nreasoning (if this is the case, then measures that employ verbal expressions of uncertainty are to be preferred) or in \nterms of actuarial and systematic terms (if this is the case, then measures that employ numeric expressions of \nuncertainty are to be preferred). Verbal expressions were chosen in this study because it is assumed that people \nthink about the chances of victimization using intuitive and non-rule based reasoning, rather than numeric, formal \nand rule-based information processing. \nvii\n Warr (1989) found that where crimes are perceived be more wrong than harmful, then worry wrongfulness \ndominates the seriousness judgment, and vice versa: where crimes are perceived to be more harmful than wrong, \nthen harmfulness dominates the seriousness judgment. \nviii\n It is for future study to investigate the extent to which perceived control consists of perceived self-efficacy and \nspecific beliefs\/representations of criminal acts. \n"}
