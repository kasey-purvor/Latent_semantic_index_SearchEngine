Introduction\n1.1 The soil monitoring problem\nThere is considerable interest in how best to monitor the quality of the soil, so as to\nensure that it is managed sustainably (e.g. Mol et al., 1998; DETR, 2001; Huber et al.,\n2001). There are many important questions that must be addressed if the soil is to be\nmonitored adequately. One of these is how soil properties should be sampled in order to\ndetect changes over time with adequate precision. This has been addressed in the context\nof how to estimate the mean change of a variable within an individual monitoring site\n(e.g. Miller et al., 2001). In this paper we are concerned with how to map changes in soil\nquality as spatial variables. This will be necessary in order to identify where particular\nproblems are emerging, and where effort for improved management should be targeted.\nThis is a challenging problem. Various studies have shown that the spatial compo-\nnents of soil variation can be very large in multitemporal data sets (e.g. Bringmark and\nBringmark, 1998; Webb et al., 2000). Papritz and Webster (1995a) point out that, with-\nout adequate sampling design and analysis, it may not be possible to detect important\nchanges in soil properties because of spatial variability. They considered design-based and\nmodel-based sampling designs for soil monitoring, the latter based on a proposal of Pa-\npritz and Flu\u00a8hler (1994) for geostatistical mapping of change in soil variables. They then\n2\nused simulated data to illustrate how these might be implemented (Papritz and Webster,\n1995b).\n1.2 The coregionalization model of spatio-temporal variation\nThe model-based method for estimating change proposed by Papritz and Flu\u00a8hler (1994)\ntreats a soil variable on m dates as a realization of m coregionalized random variables\nand so exploits any temporal persistence of the spatial variation that can be expressed as\ncross-correlation between values of the variables on different dates. When this has been\ndone the change in the variable between two particular sampling dates can be estimated\nfor unsampled sites, or for blocks, by cokriging, which also supplies an estimate of the\nestimation variance.\nThe advantages of this approach are twofold. First, if there is cross-correlation over\ntime then, once an initial baseline survey has been conducted, subsequent resampling\nfor monitoring could be done less intensively while maintaining adequate precision for\nestimates of the change of the soil variable at unsampled sites. Second, cokriged estimates\nof change are coherent, that is to say the estimate of change and both the estimates of\nthe variable on two dates are all best linear unbiased predictors (see Webster and Oliver,\n2001).\nThis multivariate geostatistical model of multitemporal soil data could be used to\naddress various questions. Van Duijvenbooden (1998) points out that various European\ncountries are developing monitoring schemes based on grid samples of the soil. For ex-\nample, England and Wales has a 5-km grid baseline survey, which is likely to provide a\nbasis for future monitoring (McGrath and Loveland, 1992). We may ask whether, having\nestablished a baseline survey, at what intensity we must resample on future dates in order\nto estimate changes in the soil with adequate precision. We may also ask whether it is best\nto attempt to resample the same sites, or to sample at other locations. Such questions\ncould be addressed with the coregionalization model.\n1.3 Alternative geostatistical approaches and their limitations\n3\nGeostatistical studies of real data, motivated by an interest in soil monitoring, have mostly\nfocussed on analysis of data for a single time (e.g. Arrouays et al., 2000; Scholz et al.\n1999). This is understandable since most soil monitoring activity is at an early stage of\ndevelopment. However, the limitation of these studies is that we cannot be confident that\nthe spatial variability of a soil property on one date will be a good guide to how we should\nsample in order to monitor change in the soil. For example, the spatial variability of heavy\nmetals in soil may be largely determined by geological variation (e.g. Atteia et al., 1994),\nand this will persist over time. The task of resampling is to detect change against the\nbaseline sample, not to re-estimate a pattern of variation dominated by the geology. The\nspatial variation of change in the soil properties should determine the resampling strategy,\nand this may be quite different from the baseline variation, as is illustrated by the results\nof Sun et al. (2003).\nOne interesting study on temporal change of soil properties using univariate geo-\nstatistics is that of Zhang and McGrath (2004) who analysed data on the organic carbon\ncontent of soils in part of the Republic of Ireland. These had been collected on two\ndates. These authors used ordinary kriging to estimate organic carbon content for each\ndate separately on a common grid, then estimated the change simply by computing the\ndifferences. The estimation variance of change was computed by adding the two kriging\nvariances. This method discards any information that the data for one date might con-\ntribute to estimates of the property on date two, and the estimate of change cannot be\nregarded as the best linear unbiased prediction of change because the two ordinary kriging\nestimates are not coherent (Webster and Oliver, 2001). Further, the estimation variance\nis likely to be conservative.\nDespite the disadvantages of the univariate approach, it makes no restrictive as-\nsumptions about the relationship between the variation of a soil variable on several dates\n(e.g. that it is consistent with a linear model of coregionalization) because it does not\nrequire modelling of the cross-covariance. Further, if the sampling sites on different dates\n4\ndo not coincide then it is less straightforward to model the coregionalization than in most\ngeostatistical problems since the model must be based on pseudo cross-variograms or the\ngeneralized cross-covariances of Ku\u00a8nsch et al. (1997). While the coregionalization model\nis attractive in principle, there are possible practical problems, and we require evidence\nof its usefulness when applied to real data on the soil.\n1.4 What is needed now\nWe are not aware of any studies where the approach of Papritz and Flu\u00a8hler (1994) and\nPapritz and Webster (1995a) has been applied to multitemporal data on the soil \u2014 other\nthan a rather contrived case study by one of us (Lark, 2002a) where a subsampled data\nset on soil water content was used to investigate a methodological problem. The objective\nof the present paper is to evaluate the use of the multitemporal coregionalization model\nfor spatio-temporal variability of soil properties which are pertinent to the monitoring of\nsoil quality. Our case study is based on concentrations of three metals in the top soil of\nthe Humber-Trent region of eastern England. We describe the spatio-temporal variation\nof these metals on two dates by a linear model of coregionalization. We then use this\nmodel to test the hypothesis that the spatial variation of change in metal content of the\nsoil can be quite different from the spatial variation of metal content on any one date.\nWe also demonstrate how change in the concentration of the metal can be estimated by\ncokriging and draw conclusions on how the soil of cognate landscapes should be sampled\nin order to monitor change in these variables.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1 Soil sampling and Analysis\nWe used two sources of data in this study. The first is the National Soil Inventory of\nEngland and Wales (NSI) collected by the National Soil Resources Institute (then the\nSoil Survey of England and Wales), and sampled on two dates the latter less intensively.\nThe second is data from the Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE)\nsurvey of the British Geological Survey. Since the G-BASE survey of the Humber-Trent\n5\nregion, an area of approximately 15,800 square kilometres in North East England, took\nplace at a similar time to the second NSI sampling, we have limited our study to this\nregion that is shown in Figure 1.\nThe NSI baseline survey in the Humber-Trent region took place between 1979 and\n1984. Sampling took place at sites on a 5-km orthogonal grid aligned with the Ordnance\nSurvey National Grid. Details of the protocol are published elsewhere (McGrath and\nLoveland, 1992). Soil sampling was restricted to the uppermost 15 cm of mineral soil (or\nless if rock intervened), or of peat, as appropriate, i.e. litter layers were not sampled.\nThe actual sampling depth was recorded. Twenty-five cores were taken at the nodes of\na 5-m grid within a 20-m square centred on the basic 5-km grid-point. The cores were\nbulked and mixed well in the field, double-bagged in food-grade polythene bags, and a\nwaterproof and rot-proof label placed between the bags. The target sample mass was 450\ng of air-dried soil. In the laboratory the soil was air-dried, half the material was ground\nto 2-mm, then a 25-g sub-sample was taken from this by coning and quartering, and\nground to <150 \u00b5m. This subsample was extracted with aqua regia and then analyzed\nfor a range of metals by ICP-OES or atomic absorption spectrometry (for a few metals\nincluding vanadium).\nEssentially the same protocol was followed when the NSI grid was resampled in the\nHumber-Trent region in 1995. The sample sites were selected at random from those used\nin the baseline survey so that, nationally, just under 30% of sites were resampled. There\nhad been some development in analytical methods, but reanalysis of stored soil from\nthe baseline sample suggested that the results were comparable for the elements that we\nreport in this paper.\nThe G-BASE data were collected under a non-aligned sampling scheme. The basic\nstrata were 2-km squares of the Ordnance Survey grid, and every second square was\nsampled. A sample site was selected at random within the square. At each site five soil\ncores were collected from the centre and corners of a 20-m square. As in the NSI survey,\n6\nthe cores were 15-cm long and excluded surface litter. The five cores at each site were\nbulked. All samples of soil were air-dried, disaggregated, sieved to pass 2 mm, coned and\nquartered. From each a 50-g sub-sample was ground in an agate planetary ball mill until\n95% of the material was finer than 53 \u00b5m. The total concentrations of 24 major and\ntrace elements were determined in each sample by wavelength dispersive XRFS (X-Ray\nFluorescence Spectrometry). The G-BASE sampling in the Humber-Trent region took\nplace in the summers of 1994, 1995 and 1996, and 6411 sites were sampled.\n2.2 Combining the data\nOf the NSI baseline sample points 623 lie within 10-km of a G-BASE site from the\nHumber-Trent survey. Of these 229 were subsequently resampled. We could use these\ndata alone to investigate spatio-temporal variability of metals in the soil but this restricts\nour analysis to variation over distances of 5 km or more, the basic interval of the NSI data;\nand because the resampled data are relatively sparse and collected at random, they are\nnot ideally suited to spatial analysis. To obtain information on spatio-temporal variability\nat finer spatial scales we decided to combine the NSI resampled data and the G-BASE\ndata into a single set (\u2018Date 2\u2019) for comparison with the NSI baseline survey (\u2018Date 1\u2019).\nThere are obvious objections to this. Both data sets are collected on topsoil (0\u2013\n15-cm) with litter excluded, and both from a 20-m square, but there are differences in\nsample support. The NSI sample is 25 cores bulked from across the square while the G-\nBASE data are 5 cores bulked from the corners and centre of the square. The analytical\nmethods are also different. The NSI is based on aqua regia extraction and ICP-OES while\nthe G-BASE is a solid phase analysis by XRFS that determines the total concentration\nof an element in the soil. Experience suggests that analysis by XRFS will usually yield\nlarger total concentrations of certain metals in soil in comparison to an aqua regia digest\nfollowed by ICP-OES, because during the acid digestion some of the more recalcitrant soil\nminerals may not be dissolved. This may also account, in part, for the smaller analytical\nvariances (from the analysis of duplicates and sub-samples) for XRFS (see Table 1) in\n7\nwhich some of the metals may be present in different forms.\nIdeally we would not combine these two data sets. Rather we would undertake a\nnew sampling campaign or reanalyze retained soil samples with a common technique.\nIn practice we must make the best use of available data that represents a substantial\ninvestment of resources in order to make informed decisions about how best to monitor\nthese variables in future.\nWe compared the statistics of the NSI resampled data from the Humber-Trent region\nand the G-BASE data. In this paper we focus in detail on the analysis of data on\ncobalt, and report some results for nickel and vanadium. In Table 1 we present for\ncomparison the statistics on these variables in the two data sets, and in Figure 2 we show\nthe empirical cumulative frequency distributions. As well as standard descriptive statistics\nwe present some robust measures of location (the median), variability (Rousseeuw and\nCroux\u2019s (1992,1993) Qn that estimates the standard deviation) and skew (the octile skew,\nsee Brys et al. 2003). These statistics are resistant to the effects of outlying data that are\nexpected in data on metal concentrations in the soil, since some point pollution is likely.\nThe estimator Qn is based on a linear combination of order statistics. It was proved\nby Rousseeuw and Croux (1992,1993) to be both robust and efficient.\nQn = 2.219{|Xi \u2212Xj|; i < j}(H2 ), (1)\nwhere X1, . . . , Xn are the n ordered data, {}k is the kth order statistics of the terms in\nbrackets and H is the integer part of (n\/2)+1. The constant is a consistency correction so\nthatQn estimates the standard deviation if the data are drawn from a normal distribution.\nThe octile skew is defined as\n(P0.875 \u2212 P0.5)\u2212 (P0.5 \u2212 P0.125)\nP0.875 \u2212 P0.125 (2)\nwhere Pq is the value of the ordered datum such that proportion q of the data are smaller\nthan Pq (Brys et al., 2003). The octile skew is zero if the 1st and 7th octiles are symmetric\nabout the median. Data with a conventional coefficient of skew larger than 1.0 are usually\n8\ntransformed (Webster and Oliver, 2001). We found that random variables drawn from\ndistributions in Tukey\u2019s g family with a conventional coefficient of skew of 1.0 have an\noctile skew close to 0.2.\nThe three variables shown in Table 1 and Figure 2 are among those where we\ncombined the NSI resampled data with the G-BASE data. In all cases the robust measures\nof skew and dispersion were of similar order and the shapes of the empirical cumulative\ndistribution functions were also similar. The distributions differed more or less in their\nmeans and medians, which was attributed to differences between the analytical methods\nso in all cases the data sets were adjusted to a common median value (that of the set with\nthe largest value). This was done by an additive correction, i.e. by adding the absolute\ndifference between the medians of the two sets to each value in the set with the smaller\nmedian. Note that the median and mean values of the combined data set do not affect\nthe LMCR that is fitted, since this depends only on the variances and covariances of the\nvalues on the two dates.\n2.3 Spatial Analysis\nWe assume that the value of a soil property at time u and location x, zu(x) is a realization\nof an intrinsically stationary random function Zu(x). Intrinsic stationarity is discussed\nin detail elsewhere (e.g. Webster and Oliver, 2001). It includes the assumption that we\nmay define an auto-variogram function \u03b3u,u(h) where h is a spatial interval, the lag. If\nthe soil is observed on a second date, v, then a new random function, Zv(x), is invoked\nwith auto-variogram \u03b3v,v(h). The spatial covariation of the variable on the two dates is\ndescribed by a cross-variogram function:\n\u03b3u,v(h) =\n1\n2\nE[{Zu(x)\u2212 Zu(x+ h)}{Zv(x)\u2212 Zv(x+ h)}]. (3)\nThe auto-variograms and cross-variograms can be estimated for different lags, then a\nmodel is fitted to the estimates. The joint model of the variograms must have certain\nproperties so that the overall coregionalization model is positive definite (all combinations\nof the constituent random variables have a positive variance). This is most readily ensured\n9\nby fitting a linear model of coregionalization (LMCR). We do not discuss this here, details\nare given by Goovaerts (1997) and by Lark and Papritz (2003), but it does impose the\nrequirement that the values of the variable on different dates can be regarded as linear\ncombinations of a common set of random variables.\nWhen a LMCR has been obtained for two variables then their values, or linear\ncombinations such as the difference zv(x0)\u2212zu(x0), at unsampled sites, x0, or over blocks\ncan be estimated by cokriging. Cokriging is an optimal estimator in the sense that the\nmean square estimation error is minimized, an estimate of this error is also provided\n(the cokriging variance). This variance is determined by the disposition of sample points\naround the target location or block where the estimate is made, and the LMCR. It is\ntherefore possible, once an LMCR is obtained, to compare different sampling strategies\nwith respect to the cokriging variances and so to select a strategy that is both economical\nand fit for purpose (McBratney and Webster, 1983).\nThis is not straightforward in the present case. First, we cannot use all available\ndata to estimate the cross-variogram since this can only use data from sites where all\nvariables are measured. Second, data on soil metal concentrations over a large area such\nas this are likely to contain outliers from contaminated hot spots. These will inflate\nvariogram estimates (Lark, 2000) and so will give misleading information on the precision\nwith which can be estimated from a given sample. We now discuss these issues in more\ndetail.\n2.3.1 The Pseudo cross-variogram. In this case study only the resampled NSI sites in\nthe Date 2 data set are at locations common to Date 1, that is 229 sites. This is a\nsmall proportion of all the data available and no information on spatial variation over\ndistances less than 5 km is available from these sites, but it is only these data that may\nbe used directly to estimate the cross-variogram. For this reason we used an alternative\nvariogram, the pseudo cross-variogram defined by Myers (1991) as:\n\u03b3Pv,u(h) =\n1\n2\nVar[Zv(x+ h)\u2212 Zu(x)], (4)\n10\nwhere Var[ ] denotes the variance of the term in brackets. An alternative approach is to\nfollow Ku\u00a8nsch et al. (1997) and to fit an LMCR to generalized cross-covariances. Here we\nused the pseudo cross-variogram since suitable robust estimators exist (see the discussion\nbelow).\nPapritz et al. (1993) describe the pseudo cross-variogram in detail. Here we note\nonly that, while the pseudo cross-variogram can be defined for any pair of weakly sta-\ntionary random variables it only exists in certain conditions when the variables are only\nintrinsically stationary.\nA LMCR may be fitted to estimates of the auto-variogram and pseudo cross-\nvariogram of two variables; see, for example, Lark (2002a). Certain assumptions are\nnecessary if an estimate of the pseudo cross-variogram at lag zero is not available, (Pa-\npritz et al., 1993; Lark, 2002a) but this is not the case in the present study. When\nan LMCR has been fitted, then the cokriging estimates of linear combinations of the\nconstituent variables can be obtained, as described by Papritz and Flu\u00a8hler(1994).\n2.3.2 Robust estimators of the pseudo cross-variogram. A standard estimator of the pseudo\ncross-variogram is the centred estimator proposed by Papritz et al. (1993):\n\u03b3\u0302P,Pav,u (h) =\n1\n2Nv,u(h)\nNv,u(h)\u2211\ni=1\n[{zv(xi + h)\u2212 z\u00afv} \u2212 {zu(xi)\u2212 z\u00afu}]2, (5)\nwhere z\u00afu and z\u00afv are the arithmetic averages of the variable z on dates u and v.\nThis estimator is equivalent to Matheron\u2019s (1962) estimator of the auto-variogram\nwhen v = u, and like Matheron\u2019s estimator it is very susceptible to the effect of a few\noutlying values. Outliers can be values unusually large or small relative to the marginal\ndistribution of the data (\u2018marginal outliers\u2019), or values that are only unusual relative\nto those at neighbouring locations (Laslett\u2019s & McBratney\u2019s (1990) \u2018spatial outliers\u2019).\nOutliers, other than simple errors, arise from processes different from those that cause\nsoil variation over most of the region. For example, deposits of dung and urine on pasture\ngive patches of soil with larger nutrient concentrations than the background concentrations\nelsewhere (McBratney & Webster 1986).\n11\nOutliers may represent important phenomena that we wish to detect, such as \u2018hot\nspots\u2019 of pollutants, but they should not influence unduly the variograms used to krige\nover a whole site, or to design a grid for detailed sampling. Because the differences in\nEquation (5) are squared the effect of an outlier on the estimates is large; and, because\none observation is likely to appear in several differences over different lags, one outlier\ncan inflate the whole variogram. This is clearly undesirable.\nLarge errors of measurement or transcription are usually detected and removed\nwhen data are edited, but not all outliers are unambiguously wrong. If we remove large\nor small but legitimate values we may will bias later inferences from data. For this reason\nrobust estimators should be used to estimate parameters from data that include outliers.\nSuch estimators are resistant to the effects of extreme values. Lark (2000) reviewed\nand demonstrated some robust estimators of the auto-variogram and later showed (Lark,\n2002a) that these can be generalized to robust estimators of the pseudo cross-variogram\nsince the latter is a univariate variance.\nThe sample average of a data set, used in the pseudo cross-variogram estimator\nin Equation (5) is susceptible to outliers while the median is a robust estimator of the\nlocation of a distribution. The robust estimators of the pseudo cross-variogram first centre\nthe data for each variable by the sample median. For simplicity of notation we define a\ncentred difference variable:\nY iv\u02dc,u\u02dc(h) \u2261 {zv (xi + h)\u2212 z\u02dcv} \u2212 {zu (xi)\u2212 z\u02dcu} (6)\nwhere z\u02dcu and z\u02dcv are the sample medians.\nWe may generalize the robust auto-variogram estimator of Cressie & Hawkins (1980)\nto a pseudo cross-variogram estimator \u03b3\u0302P,SRD(h):\n2\u03b3\u0302P,SRDv,u (h) =\n{\n1\nN2,1(h)\n\u2211Nv,u(h)\ni=1 |Y iv\u02dc,u\u02dc(h)|\n1\n2\n}4\n0.457 + 0.494\nNv,u(h)\n+ 0.045\nN2v,u(h)\n. (7)\nThe denominator is a consistency correction, on the assumption that the data uncon-\ntaminated by outliers are drawn from a bivariate normal spatial process. This estimator\n12\nhas useful properties. Lark (2002a) showed that it was both resistant to outliers and\nefficient. However, unlike some estimators it is not B-robust, i.e. the effect of a very large\ncontaminant is not bounded. One B-robust estimator of variance is the Median Absolute\nDifference. Lark (2002a) proposed the estimator:\n2\u03b3\u0302P,MADv,u (h) = 2.198{Median[|Y iv\u02dc,u\u02dc(h)|]N2,1(h)i=1 }2. (8)\nWhen v = u this is equivalent to Dowd\u2019s (1984) robust variogram estimator. There are\nbounds on the effect of any outlier on this estimator (see Lark 2000 for discussion) and\nsimulation showed it to be very robust although less efficient than alternatives (Lark,\n2002a).\nWe have already used Rousseeuw & Croux\u2019s (1992, 1993) Qn as a robust estimator\nof the standard deviation. This may be applied to the difference variable in order to\nreturn a robust variogram estimate:\n2\u03b3\u0302P,Qnv,u (h) =\n[\n2.219{|Y iv\u02dc,u\u02dc(h)\u2212 Y jv\u02dc,u\u02dc(h)|; i < j}(Hh2 )\n]2\n. (9)\nwhere Hh is the integer part of (1 +Nv,u(h)\/2) and Nv,u(h) is the number of centred pair\ndifference observations over lag h in our data. When v = u this is equivalent to Genton\u2019s\n(1998) robust estimator of the auto-variogram.\nIn this study we used the standard auto-variogram estimator, \u03b3\u0302P,Pav,u (h), \u03b3\u0302\nP,SRD\nv,u (h),\n\u03b3\u0302P,MADv,u (h) and \u03b3\u0302\nP,Qn\nv,u (h) to estimate auto- and pseudo cross-variograms for data on soil\nmetal concentrations from the two dates.\nLark (2000) showed that differences between robust and non-robust estimators of\nthe auto-variogram may reflect the presence of outliers in the data, but may also arise\nwhen our data do not resemble a contaminated normal process (a log-normal process may\nbe a more appropriate model). It was found that we can distinguish these situations by\ncross-validation of the variogram model. A model is fitted to each set of estimates of\nthe auto-variogram. Each observation, zu(xi), is then excluded from the data set in turn\nand estimated from the rest by ordinary kriging. This returns an estimate, Z\u0302u(xi) and a\n13\nkriging variance \u03c32K(xi) . From these we may compute a standard square kriging error:\n\u03b8(xi) =\n{\nZ\u0302u(xi)\u2212 zu(xi)\n}2\n\u03c32K(xi)\n. (10)\nIf the variogram model is correct then the expected value of \u03b8(xi) is 1, since the squared\nerror should equal the kriging variance on average. If the variogram is overestimated\n(due to outliers, for example), then the ratio will tend to be smaller than 1. However,\nthe average value of \u03b8(xi) over all observations will be a misleading diagnostic statistic\nbecause it is itself susceptible to the effects of outliers. Lark (2000) proposed the median\nvalue, \u03b8\u02dc = median [\u03b8(xi)]\nN\ni=1 as a better diagnostic because of its robustness.\nIf the variogram model is correct then the expected value of \u03b8\u02dc is 0.455 when the\nbackground process is normal. Lark (2002b) showed how confidence limits for the sample\nvalue of \u03b8\u02dc could be obtained by bootstrapping to allow for correlation among the kriging\nerrors. It is proposed that if the value of \u03b8\u02dc obtained with the variogram based on a non-\nrobust estimator is significantly smaller than 0.455, then that robust estimator is used for\nwhich the value is closest to the expectation.\n2.4 Analytical protocol\nIn this study we estimated auto-variograms for the concentration of a metal in each of the\ntwo data sets, Date 1 and Date 2. We cross-validated each model and computed confidence\nlimits for the sample \u03b8\u02dc by bootstrapping. If \u03b8\u02dc for the auto-variogram obtained by the\nstandard estimator was not significantly different from 0.455 on both dates, then this\nestimator and \u03b3\u0302P,Pav,u (h) were used to obtain auto-variograms and pseudo cross-variograms\nrespectively. Otherwise the robustly estimated auto-variogram model that performed\nmost consistently on both dates was chosen and the pseudo cross-variogram was estimated\nby the corresponding robust estimator:\u2014 \u03b3\u0302P,SRDv,u (h), \u03b3\u0302\nP,MAD\nv,u (h) or \u03b3\u0302\nP,Qn\nv,u (h).\nA LMCR was then fitted to the set of estimates by weighted least-squares with\nthe usual constraints on the coefficients to ensure a positive definite model. A simu-\nlated annealing algorithm was used that allows all model parameters to be optimized\nsimultaneously while meeting these constraints (Lark and Papritz, 2003).\n14\nThe LMCR was then used to map metal concentrations on both dates and the\nchange variable with the cokriging equations of Papritz and Flu\u00a8hler (1994). The LMCR\nwas then used to determine the following.\n1. The auto-variogram of the change variable Zv(x)\u2212 Zu(x) where v denotes the second\ndate. The change auto-variogram, \u03b3v\u2212u(h) is :\n\u03b3v\u2212u(h) = \u03b3v(h) + \u03b3u(h)\u2212 2\u03b3v,u(h), (11)\nso we can estimate the variogram of change from the terms of the fitted LMCR.\n2. The point cokriging variance for estimates of the change variable Zv(x)\u2212 Zu(x) from\nthree notional square-grid sampling schemes applied at different intensities. In each case\nthe cokriging variance was estimated for a location at the centre of a Date 1 grid cell\ncokriging from the nearest 36 observations on each date. The sampling schemes were as\nfollows:\ni. Sample effort (measured as samples km\u22122 over both dates) equally divided between\ntwo dates on a square grid with sampling at the same location on each date.\nii. Sample effort on Date 1 is constrained to the NSI baseline survey (a 5-km interval\nsquare grid) and sampling on Date 2 is at intervals 5\/n km where n is an integer\nand the sample grids on both dates are in phase, thus all Date 1 sample sites are\nresampled on Date 2. Here our sampling strategy is to resample all sites on the\nbaseline survey and to intercalate additional points.\niii. As (ii) but the Date 2 sampling is done on square grids of interval i=2,3 or 4-km\nso that Date 2 points only coincide with proportion p of the Date 1 points where\np = min\n{\n1\ni\n, 1\nimod(5)\n}\n. Here we only resample a proportion of the baseline survey\nsites and collect other samples on Date 2 from sites not previously surveyed.\n2.5 Hypothetical examples\nThe cokriging variances obtained above will reflect the particular coregionalization struc-\n15\nture of our data sets. To investigate the sensitivity of the choices between sampling\nstrategies to the strength of the cross-correlation between the two dates we compared\nstrategy (i) above with a fourth strategy for hypothetical LMCR. The strategy was\niv. Sample effort is divided equally between two dates on square grids both of interval i.\nThe The grids on the same date are aligned but offset along the rows and columns\nby i\/2. In practice the sampling on the second date would be supplemented by\nresampling some of the date 1 sites to support estimation of the pseudo cross-\nvariogram at lag zero, but we have not considered the impact of these points on\nkriging here.\nWe computed the maximum point cokriging variance of the difference between the\ntwo dates under strategy (i) and (ii) with the same grid intervals, kriging from the nearest\n36 observations for each date. We assumed an LMCR with all nugget terms zero and a\nspherical component of range 5 km. The sill variances for each date were set to 1.0 and\nthree values for the covariance of the spherical components were considered: 0.0, 0.4 and\n0.8.\n3. Results\nTable 1 shows the summary statistics for the data sets on three metals. Note that in\nmost cases the standard moment-based coefficient of skew was larger than 1 while the\ncorresponding robust Octile skew was smaller than 0.2. This suggests the presence of\noutlying values among the data. The auto-variograms for soil cobalt concentration by all\nestimators on both dates are shown in Figure 3. On Date 1 the difference between the non-\nrobust estimator and the robust alternatives is particularly pronounced. Table 2 shows the\ncross-validation results for cobalt. Note that on both dates the median standard squared\nkriging error, \u03b8\u02dc, obtained with the non-robust variogram estimator is significantly smaller\nthan expected, suggesting that this has been overestimated due to outliers. On both dates\n\u03b8\u02dc for cross-validation of the variogram model fitted to estimates obtained from \u03b3\u0302P,SRDv,u (h)\n16\nwere not significantly different from the expected value, and were in fact very close to\nit. This estimator was therefore selected to estimate the pseudo cross-variograms. These\nestimates and the fitted LMCR are shown in Figure 4, the model parameters are presented\nin Table 3. The fitted model is somewhat smaller than the estimates of the pseudo cross-\nvariogram, this reflects the constraints on the LMCR to ensure positive definiteness, and\nmay be due to some non-linearity in the process of change in the variable. Note that the\ncovariance structures for the nugget terms of Cobalt and Vanadium are degenerate, that\nis to say the implied correlation is 1.0 This probably reflects some non-linearity in the\ncoregionalization over short distances, and hence a poor fit of the LMCR. The spatially\ncorrelated components for Nickel also have a degenerate covariance.\nNote that in the pseudo cross-variograms of cobalt and vanadium there is evidence\nfor a very short range structure, and the fitted model overestimates the pseudo cross-\nvariogram at the second shortest lag (about 140 m, the shortest lag for the pseudo cross-\nvariogram is zero). This cannot be fitted by the LMCR because we do not have evidence\nin the Date 1 autovariogram for structure at these distances as the shortest lag there is\n5 km. The LMCR can only accommodate a structure in the cross-covariance model that\nalso appears in the auto-covariance model. However, the model fit is good at all longer\nlags, so our conclusions about (point) kriging variance are unaffected.\nFor economy of space we do not present all the details on the analysis for the\nother two metals, but in both cases the variogram estimates obtained with \u03b3\u0302P,SRDv,u (h)\nwere selected by the same process. The robust estimates and fitted model are shown in\nFigures 5 and 6, and the parameters of the LMCR are in Table 3. For all these metals there\nis strong spatial structure in the variability of concentrations in both dates and strong\nstructure of the covariation revealed by the pseudo cross-variograms. Spatial dependence\nis seen at lag distances of up to 15 to 25 km. This is not surprising. Rawlins et al.\n(2003) have shown that the variation of trace metals in the soil of this region is strongly\ninfluenced by the spatial pattern of parent material, and this factor is unchanged over\n17\ntime.\nThe variograms of the difference variable were computed from the fitted LMCR\nwith Equation (11). There is some question over how reliable these are because of the\nsensitivity of the semi-variance of the change at shorter lags to the covariance structure\nof the nugget component of the LMCR, which is degenerate for cobalt and vanadium and\ndoes not reflect all the information in the pseudo cross-variogram because of the absence\nof short-range information for date 1. Equation (11) is therefore likely to underestimate\nthe nugget component of the change variograms. As a check we computed the change\nvariogram directly from the observed change at the relatively few resampled NSI sites from\ndate 2. There are only 203 of these for cobalt and nickel and 155 for vanadium. Further,\nas we have seen, the variances of the date 2 observations from the NSI resampling are\nnot always similar to those from the GBASE data for date 2. The comparison of the\nvariogram estimates with the models obtained from Equation (11) must therefore be\nmade with some caution. Both are presented in Figure 7. There is good agreement for\nnickel and vanadium, (although the sparsity of data on the latter means that we cannot\nlook at lags less than 10km). The agreement for cobalt is poor, particularly at longer\nlags. Both sets of variograms show that the spatial structure of the change process, which\nis the variable of central interest in soil monitoring, may not be inferred directly from\nobservation that the variables on either of the two dates have spatial structure. The\nchange variables for cobalt and vanadium both show strong spatial structure, but that\nfor nickel is close to a nugget process, essentially a flat variogram. This indicates that, in\nthe case of nickel, the spatially structured variation is very similar on both dates, and the\ndifference is a process of uncorrelated noise. For the other elements there is some spatial\nstructure to the process of change in the metal concentration. This will have implications\nfor our interpretation of the data (the likely processes driving change in each case) and\nfor monitoring. It would be futile to try to map change in nickel concentration in this or\ncognate environments by kriging, for example, given the lack of spatial dependence.\n18\nThe change in the other elements can be mapped, however, as long as we can\nsample at intervals of 7 km or less. This is illustrated in Figures 8 and 9. The former\nshows cokriged estimates of the metal concentration for both dates. In Figure 9 (top)\nis the kriged map of change in the variables. Note that this has been scaled to a mean\nchange of zero (since we are not certain that the overall difference between the dates is\ndue to anything other than differences in laboratory methods). This does not affect the\nkriging variance (lower map) that shows how the uncertainty of the map of change varies\nwith the density of observations over the region.\nThe kriging variances for difference sampling schemes are shown for cobalt and\nvanadium in Figure 10. The kriging variance falls with sampling effort, so in principle we\ncould read off these graphs the sample effort needed to map change in the variables to\na specified level of precision. Note that the cokriging variance at a given level of effort\nis always smallest for case (i) where the sampling effort is divided equally between the\ndates. The response to extra effort is much smaller when this is concentrated on a single\ndate. Similarly, at a given total sampling effort, the cokriging variance is smaller when the\nDate 2 sample includes all the Date 1 sites (dotted line), although the difference depends\non the spatial variation of the change process and is bigger for cobalt than for vanadium,\nsince the change process in the latter case has a very small nugget variance.\nThe cokriging variances for the hypothetical case studies are shown in Figure 11.\nNote that the cokriging variances decrease as the correlation between the spatially struc-\ntured components of the variables on the two dates increase. Note also that strategy\n(iv) is preferred to (i) when the correlation is weak or absent, but it is best to resample\nat the original sites (as in our LMCR for cobalt and vanadium) when the correlation is\nstrong. When the correlation is small the cokriging variance will approach the sum of the\nordinary kriging variances for the two dates separately, and it is clear that this can be\nminimized over points within a sampled region if we minimize the distance to the nearest\nneighbouring sample point, regardless of the date on which it is sampled. By contrast,\n19\nwhen the correlation is strong we benefit from direct observation of the change variable..\n5. Conclusions\nWe have estimated auto-variograms for metal concentrations in the soil on two different\ndates, and estimated the pseudo cross-variograms. For each metal these variograms could\nbe fitted reasonably well by a linear model of coregionalization, as first proposed by Papritz\nand Flu\u00a8hler (1994). We could then use these models to draw the following conclusions\nthat are pertinent to the problem of soil monitoring.\ni. As hypothesized above, the spatial variability of the change in a soil variable, which\nwill determine the efficiency of a particular sample design for monitoring, is not\nnecessarily related to the variability of the property on a particular date. The\nspatial variability of metals in the soil of this region is driven primarily by parent\nmaterial, which determines a strong spatial pattern distinct from the factors that\ndrive change (Rawlins et al., 2003). We should be wary of planning monitoring from\nobservations of a variable on a single date.\nii. For some variables the spatial variation of the change process means that it is possible\nto map this change by cokriging from a feasible sample density, while this is not\npossible for other variables (nickel in this case) A LMCR from a reconnaissance\nresampling of the baseline grid is necessary in order to identify which properties\ncould be monitored in this way.\niii. The most efficient sampling design for cokriging estimates of change in the variables\nwe have looked at here is to divide sampling effort equally between dates. In practice,\nhowever, we require a good baseline survey, and subsequent resampling will have to\nbe designed within cost constraints.\niv. When we are resampling a baseline survey of the variables that we have examined\nhere, with quite strong correlation of the spatially dependent components of vari-\nation on the two dates, then it is important to resample the original sites in order\n20\nto avoid inefficiency, particularly if the short-range variability is large. In practice\nresampling a site may be constrained by the disturbance caused on previous visits,\nand the accuracy with which the sample site can be relocated. In this case study a\nbulk sample from within a sampling area was used which smooths local variation,\nreduces the effect of relocation error, and would allow the sampler to avoid obviously\ndisturbed microsites.\nv. By contrast, the hypoithetical cases show that if the correlation between observations\non two days is weak then resampling the date 1 sites on date 2 will be inefficient\n(although some resampling will be needed to estimate the pseudo cross-variogram\nat lag zero). This underlines our observation under (ii) above that a reconnaissance\nresampling of a baseline survey, so as to estimate the LMCR, will allow a rational\ndecision to be made about how best to undertake a full second sampling to monitor\nchange in soil against a baseline.\nWe now examine the broader implications of these conclusions for soil monitoring\nstrategy. The first decision to be made when planning a monitoring scheme must be\nwhether we require local or regional estimates of change in the soil. The latter may\nbe satisfactory for many purposes, but local estimation will be necessary if one goal\nof monitoring is to identify where remediation may be needed, or possible sources of\nproblems. When regional estimates are required then design-based sampling according to\nsome scheme of randomization is straightforward and cost-effective (Papritz and Webster,\n1995a). The considerations on which design-based or systematic sampling would be chosen\nfor a problem are discussed by Brus and de Gruitjer (1997). An important point that\nthey emphasize is that design-based sampling and estimation can be correctly applied to\nspatially dependent variables. It may also be chosen over geostatistical estimation when\nthere is no evidence of spatial dependence, or when spatial dependence is only seen over\ndistances that are too small to be resolved with available sampling effort.\nIf we decide that local estimation is required, then we face two questions.\n21\ni. Is it feasible to obtain local estimates of change, given the spatial variability and the\navailable resources for sampling?\nii. How should the sampling be done to estimate change with adequate precision?\nWe have seen that the answer to this question depends quite sensitively on the spatial\ncoregionalization of the variable with itself over time, and that the spatial variability of the\nvariable on a single date may be a poor guide to this. In practice, when sampling against\nsome existing baseline survey, we could conduct a reconnaissance sample to estimate an\nLMCR. This would include some resampling of previous sites, and sampling at intervening\nsites to give information on short-range variability. The resulting LMCR can then be used\nto investigate the cokriging variances for change in the variable under different sampling\nschemes, as we have done here.\nIf the LMCR indicates that local estimates of change in the variable cannot be ob-\ntained with available resources for resampling then we are confined to regional estimation.\nWhen the baseline survey is a systematic grid then this lack of randomness must be ac-\ncounted for in the resampling and estimation of a regional mean. One approach would be\nto use cokriging of the regional mean, as discussed by Papritz and Webster (1995a).\nOur discussion above assumes an essentially static approach to sampling, with the\naim of estimating change relative to some baseline survey. Thus may be suitable for many\nproblems in soil monitoring where changes are relatively small and slow. For more volatile\nproperties, where the changes are large relative to the baseline values, an adaptive ap-\nproach to monitoring may be favoured, as used by Wikle and Royle (1999) for atmospheric\nmonitoring.\nAs a final comment, we accept that the LMCR may prove too restrictive a model for\nmultitemporal soil variation. We suggest that the development of ideas for soil monitoring\nshould start from the proposals of Heuvelink and Webster (2001) for the modelling of soil\nvariation in space and time. In short, rather than looking for more complex statistical\nmodels we should aim to incorporate physical knowledge of the processes and mechanisms\n22\nof soil pollution or degradation into the monitoring scheme.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by the UK Department for Environment and Rural Affairs\n(Defra) under grant SP0520.
