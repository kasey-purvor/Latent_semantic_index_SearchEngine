To translate encouraging experimental findings into human benefits, information is first needed on the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and, ultimately, clinical efficacy of resveratrol. Published clinical trials have largely focused on characterizing the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of resveratrol. Recent studies have also evaluated safety and potential mechanisms of activity following multiple dosing, and have found resveratrol to be safe and reasonably well-tolerated at doses of up to 5 g\/day. However, the occurrence of mild to moderate side effects is likely to limit the doses employed in future trials to significantly less than this amount.
