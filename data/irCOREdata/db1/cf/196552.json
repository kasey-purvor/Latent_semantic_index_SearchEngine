The numerical modeling of semi-solid processing requires data on the rheological \nproperties of materials. This data is often obtained by rheometry but there are difficulties with \ncharacterizing high solid fractions, where the torque which can be exerted with the rheometer is \ninsufficient. A number of other methods for measuring the flow parameters, including compression \nbetween platens, have been utilized. The various methods will be reviewed in this paper. \nComputational fluid dynamics modelers have often used data from steady state experiments but it is \nthe behaviour during rapid transients which is more relevant to the actual semi-solid processing \nroute.  \nIntroduction \nAt MIT in the early 1970s, Spencer at al. [1] discovered that metallic alloys in the semi-solid state \nwith a non-dendritic microstructure, (i.e. spheroids of solid in a liquid matrix), behaved in a \nthixotropic way. When sheared the material thinned but when it was allowed to stand it thickened \nagain. This occurs because, on shearing, the bonds between spheroids, and between agglomerates of \nthose spheroids, are broken down and when allowed to stand they rebuild. This behaviour is the \nbasis of a family of innovative manufacturing processes termed semi-solid processing. The \ntechnology is in use commercially in the form of:- thixoforming, where material with a non-\ndendritic microstructure on reheating into the semi-solid state is forced into a die; rheocasting, \nwhere a liquid alloy is cooled into the semi-solid state in such a way as to give a non-dendritic \nmicrostructure, and then placed in the shot sleeve of a die casting machine; and thixomoulding \n(which to date has only been applied to magnesium alloys), which is allied to injection moulding of \npolymers, with a continuous screw feed. In all cases, die design can be made more efficient and \neffective through the use of modelling. Modelling requires the input of parameters to describe the \nrheological behaviour of materials. The purpose of this paper is to review the experimental \ndetermination of these parameters. A fuller discussion, extensive references and full details of the \nequations are given elsewhere [2]. Previous reviews include those by Kirkwood [3], Atkinson [4], \nAlexandrou [5], Fan [6] and Modigell [7].  \n     It is necessary first to give some background rheology and then to look at the measurement of \nflow under a steady shear rate and flow under a changing, (i.e.transient) shear rate.  \nBackground Rheology \nIn a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress,\u03c4 , is proportional to the shear rate, \u03b3\uf026 , and the constant of \nproportionality is the viscosity, \u03b7 . Thixotropic fluids are non-Newtonian i.e. the shear stress is not \nproportional to the shear rate. The viscosity is then termed the apparent viscosity and is dependent \non shear rate, pressure, temperature and time. Some non-linear fluids also show viscoelasticity i.e. \nthey store some of the mechanical energy as elastic energy. Thixotropic materials do not store \nenergy elastically and show no elastic recovery when the stress is removed. \n \n \n \n     If a fluid exhibits a yield stress and then gives a linear relationship between shear stress and shear \nrate, it is termed a Bingham material. Then: \n \n\u03b3\u03c4\u03c4 \uf026ky +=                                                                                                                                    (1)     \nwhere k  is a constant related to the viscosity.  The Herschel-Bulkley model is where behaviour is \nnon-linear after yield i.e.: \n \n     ny k\u03b3\u03c4\u03c4 \uf026+=                                                                                                                                  (2). \n \n     There is dispute over whether thixotropic semi-solid alloys display yield [eg. 8] and whether they \nshould be modelled as such (e.g. [5]). Koke and Modigell [9] have used a shear stress controlled \nrheometer to measure yield stress directly on Sn 15%Pb. They distinguish between a static yield \nstress where the fluid is at rest prior to the application of a shear stress, and a dynamic yield stress \nwhere the fluid is being continuously sheared. Their results are shown in Fig. 1.  \n \n  \nFig. 1 Shear-stress ramp experiments after different rest times (tr) for Sn-15%Pb [9]. (a) Shear \nstress versus deformation angle. (b) Shear stress versus rest time. Temperature 195\u00baC, fraction solid \n0.5, globular structure prepared by shearing at 100s-1 at a cooling rate of 1\u00baC\/min. \n      \n     The yield stress increases with rest time prior to deformation because of the increasing degree of \nagglomeration. In terms of modelling semi-solid alloy die fill, the use of a yield stress may be \nappropriate because a vertical billet does not collapse under its own weight unless the liquid fraction \nis too high. In addition, in rapid compression experiments (to be described) later an initial peak in \nthe load versus displacement curve is detected. Contrary to this, though, is the fact that, at the \n\u2018thixoforming temperature\u2019, the initial peak is so small as to be undetectable. \n     The Ostwald de Waele relationship: \n \n   nk\u03b3\u03c4 \uf026=                                                                                                                                             (3) \n \nis used to describe fluids which do not have a yield point and where there is a power law \nrelationship between the shear stress \u03c4 and the shear rate \u03b3\uf026 . If the exponent 1=n , this reduces to \nthe expression for a Newtonian fluid with the constant k equal to the viscosity \u03b7. A shear thinning \nmaterial (whose viscosity decreases as the shear rate increases) would have a value of n of less than \n1 and a shear thickening material would have n  greater than one. Thixotropic materials are \nessentially shear thinning but also thicken again when allowed to rest (i.e. all thixotropic materials \nare shear thinning but not all shear thinning fluids are thixotropic).  \n \n \n \n     It is thought that at very high shear rates and at very low shear rates, thixotropic fluids effectively \nbecome Newtonian. This is expressed in the Cross model: \n \n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n+\n\u2212\n+= \u221e\u221e nk\u03b3\n\u03b7\u03b7\n\u03b7\u03b7\n\uf0261\n0                                                                                           (4) \n \nwhere as the shear rate 0,0 \u03b7\u03b7\u03b3 \u2192\u2192\uf026  and as \u221e\u2192\u221e\u2192 \u03b7\u03b7\u03b3 ,\uf026 .  These are steady-state viscosities \nand, as will be discussed below, it is the transient behaviour which is particularly of importance for \nthe modelling of thixotropic die fill. \n     Viscosity is highly dependent on temperature. For a \nNewtonian fluid (e.g. the liquid matrix in a semisolid slurry), the \nviscosity decreases with increase in temperature. Temperature \nalso affects the microstructure. Thus, in semisolid slurries, the \nfraction solid decreases with increase in temperature, with a \nconsequent effect on viscosity. In addition, over time, the \nmicrostructure will coarsen by diffusion and this will be \naccelerated as the temperature increases. Quite a lot of data is \navailable for the model Sn\/Pb alloys but there is less for \naluminium alloys because there are few commercially available \nrheometers that operate above about 500\u02daC. \n     For a thixotropic material at rest, when a step increase in shear \nrate is imposed, the shear stress will peak and then gradually \ndecrease until it reaches an equilibrium value for the shear rate \nover time (Fig. 2). The higher the shear rate after the step, the \nlower the equilibrium viscosity. The peak viscosity encountered \nwill increase with increasing rest time before it recovers back to \nthe equilibrium viscosity of the shear rate specified. \n \nSteady State Measurements \n \nThe flow behaviour in the steady state is dependent on the fraction solid, particle size, particle \nshape, time and stress history. It can also depend on the temperature history; the results will be \ndifferent if the semi-solid state originated from cooling from the liquid state or reheating from the \nsolid state. This is because of Ostwald ripening of the solid spheroids during the treatment, which is \nturn leads to a change in particle size. \n     There are three principal methods of carrying out steady state measurements. These are capillary \nrheometry; rotational rheometry and compression experiments. Capillary rheometers, where \nmaterial is pushed down a tube and the pressure drop measured, give high shear rates and conditions \nclose to those during semi-solid processing. However, measuring the pressure drop accurately can \nbe difficult. \n     Rotational rheometry with concentric cylinder rheometers has been widely used but can generally \nonly work with fractions of solid below about 0.5; above this the material is too stiff for the \ninstrument to operate. In addition, in the past, few such rheometers have been capable of operating \nat temperatures where Al alloys are semi-solid, or above. This situation is now changing (e.g. \n[10,11]). The shear rates available in rotational rheometers are in the medium range. \n     To examine slurries with fractions of solid above 0.5 there are various options. Laxmanan and \nFlemings [12] established a technique involving slow compression.  The material is placed between \ntwo insulating platens (for isothermal conditions) and the load measured during deformation at \nconstant velocity. The results are difficult to interpret because the deformation is inhomogeneous (in \nFig 2. Response of an \ninelastic thixotropic material \nto first a step-change up in \nshear rate and then a step- \nchange down.. \n \n \n \ncontrast with the steady state in a viscometer). Laxmanan and Flemings assume, for simplicity, in \ntheir analytical solution, that the flow is in fact Newtonian. This is clearly a shortcoming. A step \nfurther would be to use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate the compression but this \nwould need to be an iterative process because the CFD, in itself, requires the assumption of a \nrheology model and the input of parameters. \n     Other potential methods include forward extrusion [e.g. 13], although the tests may not be \nisothermal and there is a possibility that only material in the wall region may be broken down \nleading to \u2018plug\u2019 flow. However, appropriate design of the die entrance can break the material down \nand there is reasonable agreement between the results of these workers and those from earlier \nexperiments by slow compression [12]. \n \nTransient Behaviour \n \nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been extensively used to predict die filling (see eg. [2]). \nHowever, some of the work reported has been based on rheological data obtained in steady state \nexperiments, where the semi-solid material has been maintained at a particular shear rate for some \ntime. In reality, in thixoforming for example, the slurry undergoes a sudden increase in shear rate \nfrom rest to 100s-1 or more as it enters the die. This change takes place in less than a second. Hence, \nmeasuring the transient rheological response under rapid changes in shear rate is critical to the \ndevelopment of modelling of die filling and successful die design for industrial processing. It can be \ninvestigated with two types of experiment. Firstly, via rapid shear rate changes in a rheometer and \nsecondly, for higher fractions solid (where the torque capability of a rheometer is not sufficient), \nwith rapid compression experiments, for example, in the thixoformer itself or in a drop forge \nviscometer. \n     Rapid Shear Rate Changes in Rheometers Studies of transient behaviour have included those \nby Kumar [14], Quaak [15], Peng and Wang [16], Mada and Ajersch [17], Azzi et al [18] Koke and \nModigell [9] Modigell and Koke [19,20] and Liu et al. [21,22]. Two relaxation times were \nquantified: (1) breakdown time and (2) buildup time. The breakdown time is the characteristic time \nfor the slurry to achieve its steady-state condition after a shear rate change from a lower value to a \nhigher value, while the buildup time is for a change from a higher shear rate to a lower shear rate. \nThese workers found that the times for breakdown are faster than those for buildup. This would be \nexpected, as the breaking up of \u2018bonds\u2019 between spheroidal solid particles in agglomerates is likely \nto be easier than the formation of bonds during \nshear-rate drops. Quaak [15] proposes two \ncharacteristic times to describe a shear rate jump. \nHe suggests that during a shear-rate change, the \nslurry undergoes an initial rapid \nbreakdown\/buildup followed by a more gradual \nprocess dependent on diffusion. This can be \ndescribed by a double exponential expression. \nQuaak gives Fig.3 as the microstructural basis. \nImmediately after a change in shear rate, the \nstructure remains the same (\u2018iso-structure\u2019). This \nis followed by a very fast process and then a slow \nprocess, associated with diffusion, giving \ncoarsening and spheroidisation. It is the \u2018very fast \nprocess\u2019 which is relevant to modelling die fill. \nIn a rheometer, great care must be taken to ensure \nthat inertial effects do not interfere with the \n \nFig. 3 Schematic model describing the fast \nand slow processes in a semi-solid \nmaterial\u2019s structure after shear rate up and \ndown jumps (taken from ref. [15]) \n \n \n \nresults [e.g. see 22]. In addition, instrumental effects must be carefully separated from those of the \nmaterial itself, particularly when attempting to examine behaviour that occurs in less than a second. \nFor example, electronic switching may occur during the shear rate jump. This can be allowed for by \nonly analysing results after the shear rate has reached ~90% of the specified final shear rate (see \n[22]). The work of Liu et al. [22] involves the fastest data collection rate so far (~1 kHz capture \nrate). This is significantly faster than that used by other workers (200 Hz in [14], 9 Hz in [15], 200 \nHz in [16]) and enables the capture of the very fast process. The results for shear rate jumps from 0 \nto 100 s-1 after different rest times are shown in Fig. 4. With longer rest times, the peak stress \nrecorded increases. The breakdown times in Table 1 were obtained by fitting an exponential to the \ndata obtained during the second after 90% of the final shear rate was achieved. In Table 1, \u03b7p is the \npeak-stress viscosity, \u03b7ss is the \u2018first\u2019 steady-state viscosity (given that there are at least two \nprocesses going on as mentioned earlier) and b\u03c4  is the \u2018first\u2019 breakdown time. Table 1 shows that \nthe longer the rest time prior to the shear rate jump, the lower the breakdown time. This is consistent \nwith microstructural evidence showing that increasing the rest time increases the solid-particle sizes \nand the degree of agglomeration. This increase would impede the movement of the particles upon \nthe imposition of the shear stress. The ease with which particles are able to move past each other \ndepends on the fraction of liquid medium present, the size of the particles and the degree of \nagglomeration. The data show, that during a change in shear rate, in about 0.15 seconds the \nsemisolid structure would have broken down from its initial state. Regardless of the initial shear \nrate, the breakdown time decreases with increasing final shear rate [15, 17,18, 20, 22]. \n     As far as the existence of \u2018iso-structure\u2019 during the jump is concerned, Turng and Wang [23] and \nPeng and Wang [16] observed an overshoot in the measured stress during a rapid increase in shear \nrate. They found that this overshoot (or undershoot in the case of a decrease in shear rate) is \nproportional to the change in shear rate. Therefore, they argue, for that instant, the material is \nbehaving in a Newtonian way. The viscosity, and hence the structure, is constant, during the change. \nPeng and Wang [16] observed that the overshoot increases with increasing solid fraction. Horsten et \nal. [24] and Quaak and co-workers [15,25] argued that during this transient period structure \nevolution has not had time to occur and the structure corresponds to that of the previous shear rate. \n               \n      \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\nTime (secs)\nSh\nea\nr \nst\nre\nss\n (P\na)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nSh\nea\nr \nra\nte\n (1\n\/s)\nShear rate\nShear stress \n(after 5 hrs rest)\nShear stress\n(after 0 hr rest)\nShear stress\n(after 1 hr rest)\nShear stress\n(after 2 hrs rest)\nFig. 4 Shear rate jumps from 0 to 100 s-1 after \ndifferent rest times for Sn 15%Pb alloy at \nfraction solid 0.36 [22]. \n \nParameters obtained from shear rate jump experiments \nShear rate \nJumps (s-1) \n0-100 \nRest times \n(hrs) \n0 1 2 5 \np\u03b7  (Pas)* 2.1 5.4 8.0 23.0 \nss\u03b7  \n(Pas)** \n0.8 0.8 1.2 2.0 \nb\u03c4  (s)*** 0.18 0.16 0.15 0.12 \n* The errors are within 95% confidence limits (\u00b1 \n0.5) \n** The errors are within 95% confidence limits (\u00b1 \n0.2) \n***The errors are within 95% confidence limits (\u00b1 \n0.03) \nTable 1: Tabulation of parameters \nobtained from shear rate jump \nexperiments on Sn15%Pb alloys (at \nFs= 0.36) under different rest times \n[22].  \n \n \n \n \nKumar et al [25] and Koke and Modigell [9] however, find shear thickening \u2018iso-structural\u2019 flow \nbehaviour and the latter authors argue that this finding is of high importance for simulation of the \nindustrial process. \n     Data on the transient behaviour of aluminium alloys is sparse because the majority of the \ncommercially available rheometers do not operate at semisolid aluminium alloy temperatures. \n     Rapid Compression For high solid fractions, above about 0.5, conventional rheometers do not \nhave sufficient torque capability. Other methods must then be used, introducing complexity because \nthe shear rate is no longer constant throughout the material (as it can be assumed to be in a \nconcentric cylinder rheometer). Laxmanan and Flemings [12] measured the force and displacement \nfor Sn 15%Pb compressed between parallel plates at low strain rates. The resulting load was not \nmeasured directly (but rather, derived from the pressure on the ram) and the rate of compression \nwas much slower than in the industrial process. The work of Lou\u00e9 et al [27], carried out at higher \nshear rates by backward extrusion on aluminium alloys, resembles industrial thixoforming more \nclosely. However, the specimens were heated to temperature over a long period of time (~ 10 \nminutes) and then held isothermally for 30 minutes before compression. Such time periods would \nbe considered long in industrial thixoforming. Yurko and Flemings [28] designed a drop forge \nviscometer to study fluid flow behaviour at transient high shear rates. It consists of a lower platen \nand an upper platen, with an attached platen rod to track platen motion with time. It is similar to a \nparallel plate compression viscometer but the upper plate is allowed to fall under the influence of \ngravity. A high-speed digital camera images the rod as it falls. The force is calculated from the \nsecond derivative of the displacement data allowing calculation of viscosities at shear rates in \nexcess of 1000 s-1. A typical experiment yields instantaneous, volume-averaged viscosity first under \nrapidly increasing shear rate and then under rapidly decreasing shear rate. Segregation of liquid from \nsolid did not occur at the high shear rates.  \n     Liu et al. [29] have carried out rapid compression in the thixoformer itself using a load cell to \nrecord the load versus time signals. The compression rate is then akin to industrial thixoforming and \nthe load is measured directly. A series of typical signal responses is shown in Fig. 5. \n \nThe peak is believed to originate from the three-dimensional skeletal structure built up in the solid \nphase at rest, which breaks down under load. The width of the peak (or, more accurately, the \ndownward part of it) is a measure of the time taken to destroy this skeletal structure. A rough \nFig. 5 Load signals and microstructures at different temperatures for Alusuisse A356 \naluminium alloy in rapid compression tests (ram speed 500 mm\/s, zero soak time) [29]. \n \n \n \n \nestimate then gives a breakdown time of about 10 ms, an order of magnitude less than the relaxation \ntimes obtained from shear rate jumps in rheometer experiments (see earlier) and must therefore be \nrelated to a different mechanism. The height of the peak falls with temperature as the skeletal \nstructure is consumed, and the minimum load beyond the peak also decreases with increasing \ntemperature, both because a more spheroidal microstructure is developed and the fraction liquid \nincreases (see Fig. 5). In practice, successful thixoforming takes place at temperatures where there is \nlittle or no peak. Viscosity versus shear rate can be derived from the load-displacement data using a \nmethod based on that outlined in Laxmanan and Flemings [12]. As mentioned earlier, this does, \nhowever, assume a Newtonian fluid at one stage in the analysis and this may introduce errors.  \n     Data on viscosity versus shear rate for Al-Si alloys is summarised in Fig. 6. It is important to be \naware that small changes in silicon content can affect the results quite considerably by changing the \nsolid fraction. The lower values recorded by Yurko and Flemings [28] in comparison with those of \nLiu et al. [29] are derived for \nan alloy with higher silicon \ncontent and also one which has \nbeen soaked for longer (giving \na larger particle size and \nconsequently lower viscosity). \nIncluded in the figure is the \nsteady-state viscosity \ndetermined by Quaak [15] for \na 7% Si aluminium alloy, \nextrapolated to 0.5 fraction \nsolid; this is well below the \nother results, emphasizing \nthat the steady state is not \nachieved in those \nexperiments, nor in industrial \nthixoforming.   \nSummary \nIn obtaining data for modeling of semi-solid processing, it is important to use both steady-state \ninformation and information from transient changes in shear rate. Viscometers offer a measurement \nvolume with a constant shear rate but there are limitations on the shear rate that can be imposed (in \ncomparison with the actual shear rates during semi-solid processing) and until recently high \ntemperature rheometers were rare. In addition, the torque available is generally such that it is \ndifficult to experiment with fractions solid above about 0.5. Capillary rheometers present difficulties \nin measuring the pressure drops. Compression between platens is capable of providing data for \nvolume fractions above about 0.5 and for shear rates comparable with those in industrial processes \nbut the shear rate is not uniform and analysis requires simplifying assumptions which may not be \njustifiable. In summary, the modeler must be careful to understand fully the conditions under which \ndata has been obtained and the potential limitations. \n \nAcknowledgements.
