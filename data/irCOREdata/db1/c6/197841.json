ABSTRACT East African rangelands have a long history of population mobility linked to competition over key resources, negotiated access, and outright conflict. Both in the literature and in local discourse, in-migration is presented as leading to increased competition, driving poverty and social exclusion on the one hand, and conflict and violence on the other. Current analyses in developing countries identify economic differences, ethnic fault lines, ecological stresses and a breakdown in state provision of human and constitutional rights as factors in driving conflict. The present paper explores this interaction of in-migration and conflict with respect to Kenyan and Tanzanian pastoralist areas and populations. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, patterns of resource access and control in Kenya and Tanzania Maasailand are explored in terms of the ways land and livestock are associated with migration status, ethnicity and wealth or political class. Contrasts and similarities between the two national contexts are used to develop a better understanding of the ways these factors operate under different systems of tenure and access. The conclusion briefly considers implications of these patterns, their potential for exacerbating poverty, and policies for minimising social exclusion and conflict in East African rangelands.

While they have for centuries been dominated\nby pastoral and agro-pastoral peoples, the key resources (water and\nfertile land) have continually been contested by different ethnic and\noccupational groups. Mobility, in-migration, resource competition,\nnegotiated access, conflict, and assimilation have thus remained\nperennial issues throughout their history. In the course of the twentieth\ncentury, ever larger areas have been expropriated for conservation or\ncultivation (e.g. Homewood and Rodgers 1991; Igoe and Brockington\n1999; Ndagala 1990b; Fratkin 2001), with formerly fluid boundaries\ncrystallising into legally defined, often patrolled and\/or fenced, exclusion\nzones (Homewood 1995). Outbreaks of violence in East African\nrangelands have been variously presented as: Malthusian competition\nacross ethnic and economic fault lines due to resource availability\ndeclines (Ndagala 1992a; Otieno 2002a, 2002b); resource competition\nbetween minority (resident) and majority (colonising) ethnic groups\n(Ole Kuney 1994; Africa Law Review 1998); part of a direct response\nof marginalised people to systematic dispossession (Shivji and Kapinga\n1998; Munei and Galaty 1999); orchestrated events stage-managed by\nan elite seeking to retain monopoly on power and resources (Klopp\n2001); or some combination of these political and environmental\npressures and responses (Dietz 1996). However, within this broad\nrange of contributing factors, in-migration is repeatedly identified both\nby local people and by outside observers as a source of tension (e.g. Ole\nKuney 1994; Munei and Galaty 1999; Klopp 2001).\nThe present paper makes a comparative analysis of access to and\ncontrol of resources by households of different duration of residence\nand ethnic affiliation in buffer zones surrounding the Serengeti-Mara\nEcosystem (SME), which straddles the Kenya\u2013Tanzania border. Our\nstudy describes patterns of tenure and access among Maasailand\ninhabitants in the two countries, and the extent to which the\ncompetition and inequalities they reveal are consistent with current\nKATHARINE HOMEWOOD is Professor of Human Ecology in the Department of Anthropology\nat University College, London.

The cross-border comparisons make it possible to\ncontrast the outcomes of comparable ethnicities, economic systems\nand ecological processes in the different national economic and\npolitical contexts of Kenya and Tanzania. The discussion examines\nhow trajectories of exclusion and socio-economic change have been\ninfluenced by contrasting national and regional policies, and have in\nturn influenced social cohesion, or conversely, conflict. We focus on\nthe following research questions:\n1. Are patterns of tenure and resource access or control in SME associated\nwith duration of residence and\/or with in-migrant status?\n2. Are patterns of tenure and resource access or control in SME associated\nwith ethnicity?\n3. How do patterns of tenure and access to or control of resources in SME\ndiffer between Kenya and Tanzania study sites?\n4. To what extent are patterns of access to and control over resources, and\nassociated patterns of conflict, consistent with current theories on origins\nof violent conflict in developing countries in general, and East Africa\nin particular?\n5. How have trajectories of tenure and access on the one hand, and dispos-\nsession and poverty on the other, been influenced by contrasting national\nand regional policies? What policy insights do these findings suggest?\nThe paper uses empirical data to provide the first quantitative cross-\nborder comparison of the ways in which tenure and access are influenced\nby ethnicity and migration status in SME, and on the similarities\nand contrasts resulting from the different national contexts of Kenya\nand Tanzania as well as their expression through local policy in the\nstudy sites.\nBACKGROUND: LAND TENURE, ACCESS AND CONFLICT IN MAASAILAND\nOral histories and colonial archives show the Central Rift Valley and\nadjacent highlands were dominated by Maa-speaking peoples from the\nseventeenth century on, with a history of mobility, migration and social\nassimilation punctuated by devastating episodes of warfare, drought and\ndisease (Homewood and Rodgers 1991; Spear and Waller 1993; Waller\n1988). Maa-speaking peoples were organised into geographic sections\nand locations (see e.g. Spear and Waller 1993) cross-cut by clan,\nage set and stock friendship relations (e.g. Ndagala 1990a; Potkanski\n1994). Membership of these social networks structured customary\nsystems of access to communal resources. Within any one location,\naccess was decided by elders, regulated, and penalties for infringement\nenforced where necessary by warrior age sets, who also played a part\nin challenging as well as in enforcing the decisions of their elders\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 569\n(Spencer 1988). Current work suggests women played an active part\nin management and decision-making, but that from the advent of the\ncolonial period, they were progressively excluded from rights over land,\nlivestock and resource management and became juridical minors and\ndependents (Hodgson 2000). Access by outsiders, whether to temporary\nuse of resources, or to longer-term membership of the group, was\nopen to negotiation. Newcomers could develop political alliances with\nestablished families through gifts, stock alliances, intermarriage and\nadoption (Brockington 2002; Waller 1993; Spear and Waller 1993).\nCompetition might repeatedly erupt into conflict, raiding and violence,\nbut until recently such conflict remained at a level which could be\ncontained and resolved by customary means through mediation by\nelders (cf. Kurimoto and Simonse 1998; Fleischer 1999; Christiansson\nand Tobisson 1989). Permeable social and spatial boundaries made it\npossible to respond rapidly in a variable and unpredictable environment\n(Ndagala 1990a). This framework of natural resource management was\ndisrupted at the end of the nineteenth century when the Maasai and their\nherds were decimated by warfare, human and animal epidemics (Waller\n1988; Dawson 1979). The next two sections outline subsequent trends\nin land tenure, access and conflict in Kenya and Tanzania throughout\nthe twentieth century.\nKenya Maasailand\nMaasai were traditionally guided in ritual matters, including military\nstrategy, by elders, sometimes by women, and by their prophets (laibon)\nwho were especially responsible for some age-set rituals. Each age\nset nominated its own spokesmen (laigwenak). Colonial indirect rule\nwas established in the early twentieth century with appointed chiefs,\ninitiating an alternative legal system and hierarchy of power. As the\nincoming colonial administration took over land for white settler use,\nKenya Maasai were moved (voluntarily or by force) from Laikipia and\nother northern rangelands and concentrated into the then Southern\nMasai Reserve, now Narok and Kajiado Districts (Waller 1988;\nAnderson 2002; Klopp 2001). The colonial administration classed\nthis as:\n\u2018trust land\u2019, that is public land controlled by the government in \u2018trust\u2019 for the\nMaasai, a status that much land has maintained in the post Independence\nperiod. . .. the Maasai reserve . . . [was] . . . a \u2018closed district\u2019, colonial\nadministrators attempted to create an ethnically pure enclave that fitted\ntheir notions of a tribe. [Klopp 2001: 487]\nThis planted the seeds of an ethnic dimension that would in due course\naffect future decisions over land allocation, as well as creating the\nadministrative structures that would manage and control such decisions.\nThe colonial designation of a Maasai reserve imposed clear spatial\nand social boundaries where more fluid interactions had prevailed.\nIt placed control over allocation of what had been communal land\nin the hands of colonially appointed Maasai chiefs and local Maasai\n570 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nleaders as well as the district and provincial administration (Klopp\n2001). Trust land was, and is, meant to be managed in the interests\nof customary users, avoiding alienation among other outcomes (Okoth-\nOgendo 2000). However, following Independence in 1963 the Kenyan\ngovernment, encouraged by the World Bank, began to divide Maasai\nrangelands into individual, corporate and group ranches. Group ranch\nleaders emerged from, or became part of, the local elite (see case\nstudy 1; Galaty 1980, 1993, 1994, 1999; Rutten 1992). Group ranch\nmanagement elections have in practice been held infrequently, if at all,\nsince the time of group ranch formation.1 As some members of the\nMaasai elite began to acquire and deal in individual titles, and ordinary\nmembers saw little benefit or revenues from group title, pressure built\nfor group ranches to be subdivided into individual holdings (Munei and\nGalaty 1999; Rutten 1992). This is a process that continues today in\nNarok District (Thompson and Homewood 2002). The process and\nimplications of the privatisation of land in Kenya Maasailand have been\nextensively documented and analysed (particularly Galaty 1980, 1994,\n1999; Munei and Galaty 1999; Campbell 1993; Rutten 1992; Markakis\n1999; Okoth-Ogendo 2000). Land law and legal procedures in Kenya\nhave been misused by the well-placed to dispossess many poorer and\nless well-connected Maasai (Galaty 1999; Munei and Galaty 1999).\nInstances of manipulation of land-titling procedures, and in some cases\ncorrupt and illegal practice, have been widely documented (Galaty\n1994, 1999; Munei and Galaty 1999; Thompson and Homewood\n2002) and have become established in what can be seen as a systematic\nprocess of accumulation of land and wealth by a circumscribed \u2018elite\u2019.\nLand privatisation has had a serious impact on Maasai communities,\nwith much land being progressively taken over by other groups and\nmany Maasai eventually losing rights of access (Galaty 1999; Munei\nand Galaty 1999). \u2018One would expect . . . that titling Maasai land would\nhave reduced uncertainty of tenure and social conflict, but in fact,\ninstances of uncertainty and conflict have risen\u2019 (Munei and Galaty\n1999: 68). The implications are particularly serious for women and\nother dependents not qualifying for registration and land title in the\nfirst instance (Talle 1988).\nFormerly common land in Kenya Maasailand is now mostly privatised\nand much is currently undergoing rapid exclosure and\/or conversion to\ncultivation (Campbell 1993; Galaty 1994; Homewood et al. 2001).\nSimultaneously, in-migration of non-Maasai into these areas has\noccurred. Between 1962 and 1989 the percentage of population\nrepresented by Maasai had declined from 79% to 47% in Narok\nDistrict (Coast 2000), and from 78% to 57% in Kajiado (Rutten 1992).\n\u2018The net result of this influx of migrants, along with the irregular land\n1 In our study area, Lemek group ranch has had one change of group ranch committee\nmembers in twenty-five years, Koiyaki one change in twenty years, and Siana two changes in\ntwenty years (Thompson 2002).\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 571\nallocations, was to intensify a sense of land pressure and insecurity on\nthe part of the largely pastoralist Maasai\u2019 (Klopp 2001: 508).\nDuring the 1990s in Kenya Maasailand, conflicts over land and\nassociated agricultural or wildlife revenues have repeatedly erupted\nin violent confrontations (Klopp 2001; Dietz 1996; Thompson and\nHomewood 2002). Hundreds died,2 and tens or even hundreds\nof thousands were displaced (Klopp 2001). While one widespread\nperception sees this violent conflict as a reaction to in-migration\ncreating and exacerbating land shortages (Galaty 1999), there is\nconsiderable evidence to suggest that much of this violence was\ndeliberately orchestrated to undermine multiparty elections and allow\nleading politicians to retain a monopoly on power (Klopp 2001, 2002;\nDietz 1996; cf. Fratkin 2001). In North Narok these conflicts may\nhave been primarily attributable to political manipulation for electoral\npurposes, though they built on existing tensions (e.g. Galaty 1999).\nThe conflicts by no means followed simple ethnic lines (Klopp 2002).\nThere was a strong political and economic dimension: violence was\nprimarily targeted at multi-ethnic communities of smallholders, and\nbenefited large landowners and supporters of the regime of the then\npresident of Kenya, Daniel arap Moi. Throughout Narok, violence hit\nKikuyu and Kipsigis smallholders, while non-Maasai land barons were\nnot affected: class and political clientage, rather than ethnicity, were\nthe real determinants (Klopp 2001). Major tensions erupted among\nthe Maasai, with \u2018the unthinkable: physical conflict between those in\nthe privileged relation of age-set sponsorship, and cursing of elders by\njuniors\u2019 (Galaty 1994: 112).\nTanzania Maasailand\nThe Maasai have inhabited northern Tanzania since the seventeenth\ncentury, when they displaced the Datoga from the Highlands of Ngoron-\ngoro. The wars and pandemics of the end of the nineteenth century\ndevastated Tanzania Maasailand (Waller 1979; Spear 1997). The Ger-\nmans established a Maasai reserve south of the Moshi\u2013Arusha\u2013Dodoma\nroad, intending to free up the northern Monduli-Ngorongoro-Loliondo-\nLongido areas for settlers. Following the First World War and the\nBritish colonial takeover, the 1923 Crown Land Ordinance placed\nall land under the control of the Governor. The government thus\nbecame \u2018simultaneously trustee and conqueror\u2019 (Igoe and Brockington\n1999) controlling rights of occupancy, whether \u2018deemed\u2019 (customary) or\n\u2018granted\u2019 (newly allocated). The British administration also established\nMaasai reserves, and by 1926 the Masai District covered most of then\nTanganyika Maasailand, with some chunks excised for settler use. Local\npeople\u2019s customary rights were largely protected as \u2018deemed rights of\noccupancy\u2019. However, after the Second World War the colonial admin-\nistration increasingly took land from local users to grant to settlers and to\n2 By some counts, thousands lost their lives (see Klopp 2001).\n572 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\ngazette conservation areas, e.g. Mkomazi Game Reserve (Brockington\n2002), and Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Conservation Area\n(Homewood and Rodgers 1991; Shivji and Kapinga 1998). Nyerere\u2019s\nvision of a united nation in which every citizen would be Tanzanian,\nrather than a member of a tribe, led to a post-Independence policy with\ncitizens having the right to live anywhere in Tanzania. This erased the\nethnic dimension of access to land and foreshadowed the extinction of\ncustomary rights (Ndagala 1994). The post-Independence state granted\nextensive areas for parastatal farms, ranches and protected areas, over-\nriding customary rights of former users in the process. Perhaps the\nmost drastic was the granting of a cumulative total of 100,000 hectares\nof best Barabaig pasture land for a Canadian-funded wheat scheme,\nwithout consultation of or compensation to the agro-pastoralists whose\nlivelihoods it had hitherto underpinned (Lane 1994, 1996a, 1996b;\nNdagala 1990b).\nDuring the 1970s, a major USAID-funded programme (Maasai\nRange and Livestock Development Project [MRLDP]) sought to\nestablish and develop Ranching Associations (RA) throughout Tanzania\nMaasailand (Ndagala 1990b; Moris 1981). This process would have\ngiven security of tenure to resident pastoral and agro-pastoral people,\nbut it ran counter to principles enshrined in the wider national\nprogramme of villagisation (ujamaa) then underway. By the end of\nthe decade, the MRLDP had collapsed (Moris 1981; Homewood and\nRodgers 1991) and Maasai areas were brought under the villagisation\nprogramme (Ndagala 1982). In principle, ujamaa villages would have\ntheir land demarcated and registered by District Development Councils,\nand Village Councils would then allocate land on which households\ncould farm and build. In theory, land was available for every rural\nperson\u2019s livelihood needs, although not for individual disposal. In\npractice, villagisation wrought havoc on rural land tenure, and left\nmatters wide open for conflict, dislocation and land expropriation (Shivji\n1998). Registration of village grazing lands, in an attempt to improve\nsecurity of tenure, often led to fierce conflict between neighbouring\nvillages, for example between overlapping Maasai and Sonjo users in\nLoliondo (ibid.).\nFrom the mid-80s, with economic liberalisation and pressure from\ninternational financial organisations, such tenure changes increasingly\nbenefited expatriate individuals and corporations, many involved in\nexport cash crops (Igoe and Brockington 1999). The promotion\nof foreign investment has repeatedly led to alienation of village\nland to investors, under the guise of supposedly \u2018joint\u2019 ventures for\ntourism, mining, ranching or cash crops. Privatisation of land originally\nallocated to parastatals, and the upsurge in real estate development\nand speculation, have provided rich opportunities for further alienation\nto outsiders (Shivji 1998). Conservation legislation has increasingly\nconstrained natural resource use by rural populations (Igoe and\nBrockington 1999). Since the mid-1980s, the rural poor have found\nthemselves squeezed between alienation to large-scale state enterprises\n(whether cultivation or conservation) and foreign investors on the one\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 573\nhand, and the return of lands to former local landowners on the other\n(Shivji 1998).\nThe Presidential Land Commission (1991\u20131992) undertook a\ncomprehensive survey of land tenure issues in rural Tanzania,\nand its landmark Report (Tanzania 1994a, 1994b) set out both\nthe detail of individual cases and overarching, radical analyses.\nIt documented processes of expropriation and allocation, whether\nillegal, unconstitutional, or the product of confused and contradictory\nlegislation, that have become common in Tanzania. The Regulation\nof Land Tenure Act of 1992 deliberately pre-empted the Presidential\nCommission\u2019s findings and, in the face of mounting instability, sought\nto extinguish all customary rights, further deepening the \u2018utter confusion\nin the legal framework of village land tenure\u2019 (Shivji 1998: 16).\nUnlike Kenya, the ethnicity criterion underlying colonial and\nsubsequent land allocation was superseded, with Nyerere\u2019s \u2018one nation\u2019\npolicy entitling citizens to apply to live anywhere in Tanzania. As in\nKenya, the land law and legal processes which should protect the\nrights of customary users have repeatedly been bypassed, manipulated\nor reinterpreted in ways that have allowed individuals and groups\nin gatekeeper positions to sell or lease formerly communal land to\nnational and foreign investors. Court challenges and rulings have been\nignored. Conflicts over land and associated agricultural or wildlife\nrevenues in Maasailand have started to lead to violent confrontations\nand have elicited repressive measures (Brockington 1999; Brockington\nand Homewood 1999; Lane 1996a, 1996b, 1996c; MNRT 1997; Shivji\n1998; Shivji and Kapinga 1998; Otieno 2002a, 2002b).\nCONFLICT: IN-MIGRATION, ETHNICITY AND RESOURCE ACCESS\nAnalyses of conflict in developing countries tend to focus on\neither contributing factors (Stewart 2002) or issues of scale and\nintensity (Hussein 1998). Violent conflict can result from ethnic or\neconomic divides, environmental hot spots of resource concentration\nor deterioration, and\/or failures of the social contract providing\nhuman or constitutional rights between state and subjects (Stewart\n2002). Analyses of the scale and intensity of violent conflict concern\nfrequency (in terms of numbers of separate incidents), intensity (in\nterms of numbers of casualties), and their scale (individual violent\nconfrontations; instances of state violence against groups within national\nborders; political and military conflict between groups within or across\nnational borders) (Hussein 1998). In East African rangelands, violent\nconflicts around power and control of land or natural resources have\nescalated to outright civil war in Uganda. The relative stability of\nKenya and Tanzania since Independence has been explained as the\nresult of relative equality of opportunity, whether political (Tanzania)\nor economic (Kenya) (Klugman et al. 1999).\nHowever, other literature looking beneath and beyond the level\nof nation states has detailed increasing conflicts between farmers and\n574 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nherders. It has also noted widespread marginalisation of pastoral peoples\nin Maasailand, and East Africa, and more generally across sub-Saharan\nAfrica (Galaty and Bonte 1992; IIED 1992\u20131999; Igoe and Brockington\n1999; Markakis 1999; Fratkin 2001). Pastoralist peoples such as\nthe Maasai have been divided by colonially determined boundaries\n(Galaty and Bonte 1992), making them minorities in the nations\nthey inhabit. Internal administrative boundaries within nations further\nfragment already minority pastoralist peoples (e.g. Ndagala 1990a,\n1990b). Caught in conflicts of interest whether within or between\nnations, pastoralist peoples have in many cases become the victims\nof state neglect, or even the targets of state violence. Social services,\nphysical infrastructure, and political representation are routinely well\nbelow national averages in remote and low population density pastoral\nareas (Coast 2000). Where social services are provided, they may be\npreferentially accessed by more settled, non-pastoralist in-migrants to\nformerly pastoralist-dominated areas (for Tanzania Maasailand, see\nMoris 1981; Ole Kuney 1994; for Kenya, see Rutten 1992). Tensions\nover access to land and the concomitant intensifying competition for\nkey resources, whether through population growth or the political\neconomy of resource distribution, have meant even the apparently\nstable nation states of Kenya and Tanzania harbour considerable\ntensions and conflict issues around pastoralists. Mobility and migration\nare commonly high, and the associated complexities of perennially\nrenegotiating temporary and flexible access to resources are made more\nproblematic in a landscape that is progressively more rigidly surveyed,\ndemarcated and allocated. These tensions may be expressed through\nsilent discrimination and silent violence (Hussein 1998; cf. Hitchcock\n1996), while recently demarcated boundaries are reinforced with fences\nand in some cases force. Throughout the 1990s there have been cases\nwhere state agencies, coerce, evict and exclude pastoralists from their\ncustomary rangelands. In some cases this is with outsider backing for\nconservation or development ends (Peluso 1998; Brockington 2002;\nShivji and Kapinga 1998: Igoe and Brockington 1999; Brockington\nand Homewood 1999; Chatty and Colchester 2002), for development\nprojects (Lane 1996b, 1998) while in other cases this has occurred\nsimply in the course of violent power seeking (James 1996; Hutchinson\n1996; Dietz 1996; Klopp 2001).\nThere are few data allowing evaluation of the degree to which\nviolent conflict involving pastoralists may have increased and may still\nbe increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (Hussein 1998). Herder\u2013farmer\nrelations continue to shift between cooperation, competition and\nconflict as they have done for millennia. Individual violent disputes\ninvolving theft, raiding fights and even killings are probably often\noverlooked in the national and international press. State violence may\noften be presented\u2014and internationally perceived\u2014as enforcement\nagainst poachers, trespassers or other outlaws. In reality, however,\nit may represent state action supporting politically dominant resource\nusers against others, and result in mass eviction and forced displacement\nthat destroys livelihoods on potentially enormous scales (Lane 1996a,\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 575\n1998; Peluso 1998; Brockington, 2002). In cases across sub-Saharan\nAfrica (and wider than in our Maasailand study areas), political violence\nusing military action to subjugate populations and control resources has\nbeen the most violent and destructive form of conflict, affecting many\npastoralist populations in the present day, and involving raiding of\nlivestock and destruction of villages. Over the last century the nature\nand impacts of conflict have changed. In particular, the introduction of\nmodern weaponry has changed the stakes. The acquisition of modern\nweapons can give a lethal advantage to one group, as in contemporary\nnorthern Uganda (see Mirzeler and Young 2000). This may have\nhappened on occasion in the past (e.g. nineteenth-century Datoga in\nTanzania and Laikipiak Maasai in Kenya), but where there was once\nat least the theoretical possibility of balanced and reciprocal raiding\nbetween groups, total victory or at least heavy casualties have become\ncommon possibilities (Turton 1996; Kurimoto and Simonse 1998).\nLethal synergies may develop between geopolitical conflicts and local\nrivalries (Allen 1996; Fukui and Markakis 1994; Markakis 1993; Hogg\n1997; Galaty and Bonte 1992). Across Africa, pastoralist groups have\nbeen disproportionately drawn into such conflicts, in part because of\nthe colonial legacy of boundaries which left them fragmented between\nmutually hostile neighbouring nations, and cast as subversive minorities\nwithin whichever nation they find themselves (Markakis 1993; Galaty\nand Bonte 1992).\nKenya and Tanzania Maasailand have mainly experienced conflicts\nof interest, competition over natural resources, and periodic individual\nor state\/group violence. These conflicts have not escalated to the point\nof extreme political and military violence seen in Uganda, northern\nKenya and the Horn of Africa. However, both individual-level violent\nconfrontations, and ongoing low levels of violence on the part of the state\nand politically dominant groups are widespread, as is the perception\nthat such conflicts are created or fuelled by in-migration. This paper\npresents detailed household-level data and analysis of in-migration,\nresource access and exclusion in East African rangelands. It focuses on\nthe extent to which access to land and other assets are structured by\nresidence status, ethnicity, and economic\/political status.\nSTUDY AREAS\nThe research presented here focuses on the protected area-adjacent\nzones around the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem (SME) straddling the\nTanzania\/Kenya border. These rangelands are characterised by strong\necological, ethnic and socio-economic continuities, across which\ncontrasting political and economic contexts have been superimposed\n(Homewood et al. 2001). The SME illustrates processes common to\nmany savannah protected area-adjacent zones elsewhere in sub-Saharan\nAfrica. The contrasts between Kenyan and Tanzanian lands offer a\ncontrolled comparison, with related issues and factors operating in\n576 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nessentially similar ecological, ethnic and socio-economic circumstances,\nbut radically different macro-economic and political contexts (ibid.).3\nThe SME consists of the contiguous core conservation areas of the\nMaasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR), Kenya, and the Serengeti\nNational Park (SNP), Tanzania, surrounded by buffer zones that\nmake up the ecologically continuous wet-season wildlife dispersal areas\nand migration routes (see FIGURE 1). Earlier work has characterised\ndemography, land use and livelihoods within the protected area-adjacent\nzones to the north, east and south of SME, which are populated\nprimarily by Maasai agro-pastoralists (group ranches of Narok and\nKajiado Districts in Kenya; Loliondo Game Controlled Area and\nNgorongoro Conservation Area [NCA] in Tanzania). In the present\nstudy, additional foci of in-migration familiar from this previous research\nwere chosen as study sites (Coast 2000; Thompson 2002). In Kenya,\nin-migration research focused on Sikrar (Lemek Group Ranch, Narok\nDistrict) and Emarti (Trans Mara District) but also draws on previous\nwork in Lemek, Siana and Koiyaki Group Ranches (Thompson 2002;\nCoast 2000). In Tanzania, research focused on Endulen in the NCA,\nboth the administrative and trading centre (madukani) and its rural\nenvirons, drawing on comparative work in other areas of the NCA\nand Loliondo (Coast 2000; Homewood et al. 2001). Maasai make\nup most of the protected area-adjacent population to the north, east\nand south of SME. For example, a census of the NCA population\n(n=51,621 individuals) reported that 97% were Maasai (NCAA 1999).\nIn Endulen, Sikrar and Emarti sites, the balance of ethnicity has\nbeen significantly altered by in-migration, primarily of Kipsigis (Kenya)\nand Iraqw\/Mbulu (Tanzania). The nature and implications of current\nin-migration can only be understood in context, and the following\nsections sketch historical and contemporary processes within the main\nstudy sites.\nKenya\nPrimary data for this study are presented from two sites, Emarti and\nSikrar. Emarti centre lies on the western edge of the MMNR and\nhas two government primary schools and water piped from the Mara\nRiver. Sikrar is located on Lemek group ranch and is furthest of all\nKenyan sites from MMNR. It has a primary and secondary school, and\nunimproved piped water. Comparative data are drawn from previous\nresearch in sites on Siana, Koiyaki and Lemek Group Ranches, whose\nsmall trading centres each provide primary schools (and in Lemek, a\nsecondary school), dispensaries, and where there has been little or no\nin-migration by non-Maasai. These sites are dominated by livestock\nproduction and cultivation, with varying degrees of involvement in\ntourism. For example Talek, on Koiyaki Group Ranch, has grown up\naround an MMNR entrance gate, and residents do not farm but are\n3 See below for site-specific circumstances limiting this generalisation.\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 577\n1.

This site is governed by conservation priorities\npresenting a unique and difficult set of rules and obstacles that do not\npertain to Maasai in other areas of Tanzania. This does not undermine\nour overall analysis and comparison, but limits the extent to which we\ncan generalise to the rest of Tanzania from this particular study site.\nVillage grazing is demarcated within otherwise parastatal-controlled\nlands (Homewood 1995) allowing few rights over resource tenure\nand access for local users (Shivji and Kapinga 1998). Ngorongoro\u2019s\ncomplex history of in-migration, driven by climatic fluctuations, security\n(periodic raiding and violence with Barabaig and Sukuma) and, over\nthe last forty years, the alternation of development opportunities with\nperiods of imposed restriction, is set out in a later section. The main\nstudy sites were in the rapidly growing trading centre of Endulen village,\nand in its rural environs. Comparative data are drawn from previous\nwork in other areas of the NCA (Coast 2000), and from adjacent\nLoliondo and Longido (Homewood 2000; Homewood et al. 2001).\nEndulen centre (hereafter madukani) dates back to the 1950s\nwhen the colonial district officer was based in the village. It has\nundergone a recent rapid rise in the speed of in-migration, making\nit the largest and densest settlement of all the study sites. Services\ninclude commerce,4 education,5 health,6 administration,7 and security.8\nWhile Maasai lifetime residents populate the rural environs of Endulen,\nmadukani draws in-migrant professionals to work in either government\nor Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) positions.\nIncreasingly they retire there and develop business interests. At the\nother end of the socio-economic scale in Endulenmadukani, a significant\nproportion of households are in-migrant farm labourers, some of whom\nwork in return for food and shelter, and are commonly referred to as\nkibarua.\nMETHODS\nDetailed data relating to mobile and in-migrant populations are often\npoorly served by national demographic data collection exercises such\nas censuses, not least because of the difficulties involved in defining\n\u2018migration\u2019 and \u2018migrants\u2019. Migration is widely acknowledged to be the\n4 Shops, beer houses, butcheries, maize grinding mills, etc.\n5 This role expanded recently, with the opening of a government secondary school in\nApril 2001.\n6 It is estimated that up to one-third of patients at Endulen Hospital travel more than 60\nkm to use its services.\n7 NCAA zonal headquarters\n8 Police post and NCAA Game Ranger post\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 579\nmost difficult component of the demographic balancing equation to\nconceptualise, measure and analyse (e.g. Anarfi 1998).\nIn both countries, migration issues are highly sensitive; the cur-\nrent study was only possible because of previous long-term researcher\nfield presence (Coast 2000, 2002; Thompson 2002). Both qualitative\nand quantitative methods were used, focusing mainly at the indi-\nvidual and household level. In both countries a Participatory Rapid\nAppraisal (PRA) style pilot study, based on past research experience\nand complemented by participant observation, semi-structured inter-\nviews and oral histories, formed the basis for a single-round household\nsurvey (Tanzania: n=90 households; Kenya: n=157 households). The\nquestionnaire-based survey included a wide range of issues: house-\nhold composition; duration of residence; dependence on cultivation,\nlivestock and other income-generating activities; and land acquisi-\ntion, leasing and sale. The comparative data are drawn from previous\nwork comprising a multi-round survey of 288 households in Koiyaki,\nLemek and Siana (Thompson 2002) and 505 households interviewed\nin Ngorongoro (Coast 2000) as well as 174 households interviewed in\nNgorongoro and Loliondo of which thirty were re-visited in a multi-\nround survey.\nAs far as possible the same methods were used for the in-migrant\nsurvey in Kenya and Tanzania, but circumstances limit comparability.\nFor example, post-Independence Tanzanian censuses do not record\nethnicity, and analyses focusing on ethnic correlates of development\nor economic status are considered politically sensitive and potentially\ndestabilising. In Kenya, by contrast, data on ethnicity are routinely\ncollected in decennial censuses. In the present study ethnic affiliation\nwas taken as the individual\u2019s mother tongue. Respondents may\nmisreport ethnic group, especially if they are concerned that their\nrights might be affected. However, the use of lifetime residents as\ninterviewers minimised misreporting. In-migration was defined as a\nshift of permanent residence to the study site. For all study sites, \u2018long-\nterm resident\u2019 is defined by a household head who moved to the area\nprior to the 1970s. All households that moved to the study site after\n1970 are referred to as \u2018recent in-migrant\u2019. These definitions are used\nthroughout the paper.\nRESULTS\nTwo sets of results are presented here. Firstly, a description of the\nnature and scale of in-migration, including historical trends and ethnic\ncomposition of in-migrants. Secondly, resource access is outlined with\nrespect to ethnicity and migration status, with specific reference to\naccess to land. Within each of these sections, comparative data are\npresented for both Kenya and Tanzania, and results are placed in the\ncontext of other work.\n580 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nNATURE AND SCALE OF IN-MIGRATON\nBased on oral histories and survey data, there are few in-migrant\nhouseholds9 in Lemek, Siana and Koiyaki sites in Kenya, or in the rural\nEndulen environs in Tanzania.\nKenya\nSettlement and land use in Western Narok and the adjacent parts of\nTrans-Mara District were shaped by the interaction of the Maasai moves\nwith climate, vegetation, land use, conflict and disease (Waller 1990;\nLamprey and Waller 1990). Maasai spread into Western Narok between\n1903 and 1913, while further south other Maasai dominated the Loita\nHills, the southern part of Trans-Mara and northern Tanganyika. In the\nfirst decades of the twentieth century, the plains of Western Narok were\nused only seasonally, with Lemek, a site of permanent water, emerging\nas a centre of settlement, trade and livestock facilities (Waller 1990).\nColonial survey reports show there was still no permanent settlement\nanywhere west of Lemek by 1946 (ibid.). From the mid-1950s onwards\nthe colonial administration encouraged tsetse control, bush clearance\nand controlled grazing, halting the spread of tsetse by 1960.\nOral histories (Thompson 2002) dovetail with historical and aerial\nphoto analyses (Lamprey and Waller 1990; Waller 1990) to give a\npicture of Sikrar and Emarti as two \u2018frontier\u2019 sites, with different timing\nof in-migration. Our survey showed that 75% of Sikrar and 56% of\nEmarti sample household heads had arrived in the Western Narok\nstudy sites since 1960, and 53% and 37% respectively since 1970 (see\nTABLE 1).\nTABLE 1 Percentage distribution of decade of\narrival of household heads: Kenya\nSikrar\n(n = 94)\nEmarti\n(n = 59)\npre-1960s 25 44\n1960s 22 19\n1970s 13 29\n1980s 15 5\n1990s 25 3\nThe earliest household arrivals (from 1938) were recorded for Emarti,\nan area designated as Maasai by the colonial administration and\nresettled in the wake of tsetse control. However, Emarti was still\nlargely uninhabited in the late 1950s, allowing relatively free access\n9 Less than 0.02% of the study population in Kenya (Thompson and Homewood 2002;\nCoast 2000).\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 581\nwhen in-migrants sought leave from the Maasai administrative chief\nto clear and cultivate land west of the Mara plains. These in-migrants\nwere mainly Kipsigis, driven by land shortages in the then Kipsigis\nReserve to the north to seek cultivable land in Maasai \u2018closed\u2019 areas\n(Manners 1967). Maasai of the Uas Nkishu Section followed, their\ncattle benefiting from the cleared land (see Anderson 2002, for the\nfactors precipitating their removal from the Uas Nkishu Reserve). From\nthe late 1960s, private land was allocated on the western side of Lemek\nto the emerging Maasai elite (cf. Galaty 1999; Munei and Galaty 1999),\nand then sold on to in-migrant Kipsigis. Maasai settlements spread out\nthrough the rest of Western Narok during the 1970s (Lamprey and\nWaller 1990). In 1980\u201384, when Emarti lands were being subdivided,\nUas Nkishu Maasai families already in place called on others of their\nsection to move to the Emarti area. This strategic move triggered a new\ninflux, raising Maasai numbers in the ongoing contest with Kipsigis in-\nmigrants. Both Maasai and Kipsigis families gained registration as group\nranch members during this time, their petitions generally mediated by\ngifts of livestock to the lands committee.\nBefore Lemek group ranch was established in 1969, influential local\nMaasai (administration chiefs and other figures) applied successfully\nto central government for title deeds, ostensibly to guard against the\ncontinued westward movement of non-Maasai cultivating groups onto\nMaasai lands. Many of these new landowners rapidly sold land on a\npiece-meal basis to Kipsigis in-migrants (Thompson and Homewood\n2002). Further opportunities for in-migration into Sikrar arose when\nLemek Group Ranch was established. By the 1990s therefore, many\nKipsigis families had been cultivating land in the area for over thirty\nyears. At the time of registering group ranch membership, prior to the\nissue of title deeds in 1993\u20131999, many Kipsigis families were able to\nhave their names included (though excluded from the committee itself),\ngenerally on the production of a gift to the group ranch lands committee.\nThese different histories are reflected in the differential association\nof ethnicity with duration of residence for the two sites. In Sikrar,\nthe majority of long-term residents interviewed were Kipsigis while\nthe majority of recent in-migrants were Maasai. By contrast, over one\nthird of the whole sample in Emarti were long-term resident Maasai.\nTABLE 2 Percentage distribution of household head by ethnicity and residence\nstatus: Kenya\nSikrar\n(n = 94)\nEmarti\n(n = 59)\nlong-term\nresident\n(pre-1970)\nrecent\nin-migrant\n(post-1970)\nlong-term\nresident\nrecent\nin-migrant\nMaasai 3 22 35 17\nKipsigis 45 30 23 25\n582 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nThe extent to which these differences are reflected in patterns of land\nallocation is explored in a later section.\nBy no means all Kipsigis applicants who tried to establish or maintain\nresidence in these two areas were successful. It was reported that other\nKipsigis families who had arrived more recently left again, fleeing to\nadjacent Bomet District during the politically driven and violent \u2018ethnic\nclashes\u2019. These took place during the 1980s in Emarti (reportedly linked\nto the land titling procedure), and in 1992 and 1997 in Sikrar (linked\nto land-titling and multiparty elections) (Klopp 2001, 2002). As a\nresult of these clashes in both Sikrar and Emarti, Kipsigis and Maasai\ncommunities today form separate clusters, with the Kipsigis located to\nthe west of each study site, placing them closer to the predominantly\nKipsigis Bomet District.\nTanzania\nThe NCA has a complex history of settlement, with Maasai moving there\nfrom the Serengeti in 1959 as part of an agreement whereby the colonial\nauthorities removed Maasai from the newly established Serengeti\nNational Park, and created Ngorongoro as a Conservation Area with\na dual wildlife conservation and residence\/community development\nmandate, a unique situation in Tanzania. The Serengeti Maasai\nwere promised water development and other benefits at Ngorongoro,\nmost of which either proved short-lived or failed to materialise. The\ninitial advisory board set up at the time included several Maasai\nrepresentatives, rapidly reduced to one, and, from 1975, to none. There\nwere major influxes of in-migrants in the mid 1970s when the NCA\nwas\u2014briefly and unsuccessfully\u2014scheduled for Ranching Association\nstatus (Moris 1981; Ndagala 1990b; Homewood and Rodgers 1991;\nPerkin 1997) and again during periods when cultivation was relatively\nfreely allowed. These periods were interspersed with the imposition of\nsevere restrictions including eviction from the Crater, exclusion from the\nNorthern Highlands Forest Reserve, Olduvai and Olmoti, and periods\nof harassment over established cultivation (Makacha and Ole Sayalel\n1987; Shivji and Kapinga 1998). The NCAA considers cultivation to\nconflict with conservation. There are perennial threats to ban cultivation\nand to evict both non-Maasai and Maasai in-migrants and potentially\neven long-term residents from the NCA. For example, in October 2001\nthe Conservator of NCA announced a new policy to evict all individuals\nwho have moved into the NCA since 1959. The extent to which this\nmay apply in practice, in particular to non-Maasai, ex-government\nin-migrants and their families, is not yet clear. Reports in April 2002\nsuggested several in-migrant labourers had been arrested and given\nlengthy jail sentences (Jonas Olsen, personal communication) though\ntheir employers had not been penalised. In-migrants to the NCA have\nincluded Maasai seeking drought refuge grazing and, during putative\nRanching Association status years, better veterinary and other livestock\nsupport provision. At other times in-migrants have included non-\nMaasai, both poor Iraqw and Mbulu labourers looking for farmwork\n(kibarua), and also relatively well-off Chagga and Mbulu tradesmen,\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 583\ngovernment retirees and their relations, looking for opportunities to\nfarm fertile land, establish businesses and take advantage of school and\nother social services.\nEndulen rural environs are more representative of conditions\nelsewhere within the NCA, with few (6%) in-migrants since 1970, and\nan entirely Maasai population (Coast 2000). In contrast, in-migration\nto madukani fluctuated prior to 1980 (A\u02darhem 1985) but has increased\nrapidly since then, with over one-third of current household heads\narriving post-1990 (see TABLE 3). This reflects the recent blossoming\nof service and economic opportunities for the well-placed in an era\nof economic liberalisation, in a rapidly expanding settlement servicing\nTanzania\u2019s highest-earning game-viewing area.\nTABLE 3 Percentage distribution of\ndecade of arrival for in-migrant\nhouseholds: madukani, Tanzania\nDecade of\narrival Percentage\nPre-1970s 38\n1970s 8\n1980s 16\n1990s 38\nNot surprisingly for a growing trading centre, two-thirds of respon-\ndent household heads report themselves as in-migrant, and three-\nquarters of lifetime residents were born of in-migrant parents. In\nEndulen madukani, two-thirds of recent in-migrants were non-Maasai,\npredominantly Iraqw, originating from neighbouring Karatu and Mbulu\n(see TABLE 4).\nTABLE 4 Percentage distribution of household\nhead by ethnicity and resident status: madukani,\nTanzania\nLong-term\nresident\npre-1970\nRecent\nin-migrant\npost-1970\nMaasai 23 20\nIraqw 8 19\nChagga 0 7\nother Tanzanian 8 14\nKenyan 0 1\n584 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nRESOURCE ACCESS AND EXCLUSION\nWhere analyses of access to the means of production have in the past\nfocused on land, labour and capital, a sustainable livelihoods framework\n(defined by Carney and Farington 1998) extends and restructures\nthese factors in terms of the natural, physical, social, human and\nfinancial dimensions of capital. Detailed expositions can be found\nelsewhere (e.g. Ellis 2000) but for the purposes of the present paper\nnatural capital is represented primarily by land for cultivation, grazing,\nwood poles and fuel it can provide. Physical capital is represented\nby roads, waterpoints and other infrastructural developments. Social\ncapital comprises the network of social relations on which households\ncan draw to gain access. Maasai customary entitlements are structured\nby the framework of section, location, clan, and age set, alongside more\nrecent but powerful factors such as relation to local leaders. Human\ncapital is represented by access to education and health services. Finally,\nfinancial capital in the context of the rural populations in East African\nrangelands is perhaps best measured by holdings of livestock and\/or\nland, and level of employment. Types of employment may be classed\nas secure (often government) jobs, which are generally skilled and often\nwith business connections; intermediate types comprise reliable though\npoorly paid non-farm jobs; the poorest options involve sporadic, casual\nand unskilled employment (cf. Iliya and Swindell 1997).\nThe present study therefore uses empirical data to examine natural,\nsocial and financial dimensions of livelihoods. Firstly, we examine access\nto land for a variety of purposes, including cultivation, livestock grazing\nand as an investment through the ownership and rental of property.\nSecondly, broad patterns of access to and engagement with different\nlivelihoods are summarised (detailed data on education and livelihoods\nform the basis of a separate companion paper). Finally, socio-political\nnetworks and their role in exclusion and conflict are analysed here\nfrom policy documents, press reports, key informants and observation\nof individual cases. This paper does not deal with differential access to\neither physical or human capital, either with respect to national averages\nor other regions.\nAccess to land\nEast African rangelands are undergoing a widespread shift from\nprimarily communal tenure of common property resources to largely\nprivatised holdings (Toulmin and Quan 2000). There are both\nsimilarities and contrasts between the trajectories of land alienation\nfor Kenya and Tanzania Maasailand (Homewood 1995). There are\nstriking differences in the way land alienation is patterned with respect\nto in-migration and ethnicity, though trajectories in both countries\nare readily explained by what Klopp (2001: 509) calls \u2018class\u2019 (socio-\neconomic status and concomitant power and wealth). Though the\nNgorongoro Conservation Area represents a rather special situation\nwithin Tanzania, it broadly reflects trends elsewhere in Tanzanian\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 585\nMaasailand (cf. Igoe and Brockington 1999), and supports the wider\nKenya\/Tanzania comparison.\nKenya\nMaasai households in both Sikrar and Emarti report significantly\n(p < 0.0005) higher landholdings received at subdivision than Kipsigis\n(see FIGURE 2; Thompson and Homewood 2002). In Emarti, well-\nconnected Maasai received large land allocations (more than 40\nhectares) at subdivision, while poor Maasai and Kipsigis received\nsmaller areas (between 1 and 8 hectares). Half of all Emarti Maasai\nreceived more than 20 hectares. By comparison, half all Emarti Kipsigis\nreceived up to 4 hectares, and 42% received none at all. In Sikrar, over\n80% of Maasai received more than 40 hectares on subdivision while\n80% of Kipsigis received 10 hectares or less.\nFIGURE 2 Mean land received at subdivision, by ethnicity and location\nIn the Kenyan study sites, differences in land entitlement by ethnicity\nare greatest early on in the land allocation process (see TABLE 5). During\nthe 1960s, Maasai individuals resident in the area and connected to the\nadministration were able to register title to large areas of land at Lemek\nGroup ranch (covering Sikrar, Lemek Centre and Nkorinkori).10 Life\nhistories of Kipsigis and Maasai moving to the area from the 1950s\nonwards show how in-migrants were initially given permission to settle\nby Maasai administrators, and that by the 1960s these influential Maasai\nwere leasing land to in-migrants. Subsequently, Lemek group ranch was\nsubdivided; a process lasting from survey in 1995 to final allocation of\n10 It was not possible to interview these large landholders.

During this land registration process, land allocation\nfavoured Maasai over Kipsigis in Emarti.\nThe following three case studies, based on detailed life histories,\nillustrate the key points outlined in TABLE 5 and demonstrate how\nethnicity and migrant status have influenced land entitlements.\nCase study 1: land allocation to Maasai \u2018big\u2019 men in Kenya\nDuring the 1950s the colonial government operated a veterinary research\nstation and cattle-holding pens on what later became Lemek group ranch.\nThese stations were issued with title deeds held by the government.\nAt Independence, Maasai petitioned the Lands Office in Nairobi to\ntransfer the title deeds to themselves. Powerful traditional leaders, including\nadministrative chiefs recognised by the colonial administration, were able\nto use their influence and have the title deeds allocated to themselves.\nFor example, the paramount chief of the area went on to become an\nextremely respected and influential leader in the newly formed independent\ngovernment, and received large land transfers at both locations. His\nsubsequent accumulation of wealth can be judged from his obituary in\nthe national press, listing ten wives and sixty-three children, several of whom\nhold positions of prominence as Members of Parliament, officials of the\nCounty Council and so on. He had shares in at least three tourist lodges,\nowning the land on which one was built, as well as large mechanised wheat\nand livestock holdings.

The chief in Mulot (a Kipsigis\narea) brokered the original occupation of the land with the paramount chief\nof the Maasai Area. The paramount chief mandated the subdivision of an\narea of land amongst Kipsigis who had contributed livestock. Under this\nprocess, respondent X purchased 1 acre of land from the Maasai, costing\nhim two cows. Respondent X has eight years of primary school education,\nand works as a driver. On subdivision of the group ranch some thirty years\nlater he was allocated a further 4 acres. He owns four cattle (including three\nmilch cows) and a total of seven sheep and goats. He cultivates the 4 acres\nin Sikrar but has had no harvest since 1997 due to drought.\nIn contrast, a Maasai man, Y, moved to Sikrar in 1996. A registered\nmember of Lemek Group ranch, Y received 120 acres of land. He has a\ncattle herd of seventy animals including sixteen milch cows, and owns at\nleast 150 sheep and goats. He cultivates 5 acres, although no harvest was\nobtained from 1998 onwards owing to drought. Maize from his last harvest\nin 1997 totalled 30 bags and lasted the family the entire year. He still rents\nout 40 acres of land each year in smaller 2\u20133 acre plots to Kipsigis farmers,\nat a rate of Kshs 1,200 (US$20) per acre. His wife runs a small shop at a\nnearby trading centre.

TABLE 7 shows the same, with the\naddition of a further explanatory variable in terms of the number\nof livestock currently owned (a proxy measure of wealth status at\nthe time of land allocation). TABLES 6 and 7 thus represent statistical\nmodels which show the relative importance of individual explanatory\nvariables (ethnicity, duration of residence, wealth) as well as their\ncombined ability to account for the variation observed in land allocated\nat subdivision (the dependent variable). The main cells of the table show\nthe size of the partial regression coefficients or beta values. The beta\nvalue indicates the proportion of the observed variation in allocated land\nareas which is explained by a given variable.

The main cells of the table (beta values) indicate the\nproportion of the observed variation in allocated land areas which can be explained by\nthe two factors (ethnicity and\/or duration of residence) in one or both sites. The final line\nof each table shows the proportion of variation in land areas allocated which is jointly\nexplained by both ethnicity and duration of residence acting together in the model. The\ndegree of statistical significance of each component\u2019s contribution, and of the overall\nmodel, in accounting for the observed variation in size of land holdings, is shown by the\nnumber of asterisks.\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 589\nFor both locations, the amount of variance explained by the model\nincreases between Model One and Model Two, with the introduction\nof wealth in livestock equivalents as an independent variable. In Sikrar,\nhowever, ethnicity still remains the single great contributor to the\nvariance in land received at subdivision (beta = \u22120.660, p < 0.0005).\nThe introduction of land received at subdivision in Model Two\nincreases the amount of explanation of variance in current livestock\nownership in both Sikrar and Emarti (from 50.6% to 60.4% and from\n10.2% to 20.0% respectively) although it should be noted that the\nmodel only reaches statistical significance in Sikrar (p < 0.0005). The\nintroduction of land received as an independent variable reduces both\nthe strength and the significance of ethnicity as a contributor to the\nvariance in livestock ownership.\nEthnicity emerges as the major determinant of land received\noverall (beta = \u22120.634, p < 0.0005) and in Sikrar (beta = \u22120.856,\np < 0.0005). Ethnicity is also a strongly significant determinant at\nEmarti, but here (where the main phase of land allocation began pre-\n1970) migrant status is equally important and as strongly statistically\nsignificant. Overall, ethnicity and migrant status alone account for\n65.8% of the variance in the amount of land allocated, and for\n78.7% of the variance at Sikrar (29.2% of the variance at Emarti).\nIn Emarti, the amount of land received by Maasai households at\nsubdivision differs significantly (p \u2264 0.005) between long-term residents\n(mean = 20.4 ha) and recent in-migrants (mean = 3.7 ha). In Sikrar,\nthe relationship is not significant, although recent Maasai in-migrants\nreported considerably greater land (mean = 46.9 ha) at subdivision\nthan long-term Maasai residents (mean = 20.1 ha)\nIn a second analysis (TABLE 7) we include a standardised wealth\nmeasure based on livestock equivalents per reference adult. Subdivision\nand allocation occurred at very different times in Sikrar (20\u201325 years\nprior to the survey) and Emarti (3\u20135 years before the survey), and we\nhave no direct measure of wealth rank or socio-economic class at the\ntime of subdivision. Although some households will have experienced\nmajor reversals of fortune, and current livestock holdings per reference\nadult is inevitably an imperfect measure, this is still likely to be the\nbest predictor of wealth at an earlier period. Model Two is based\non the combination of ethnicity, migrant status and current livestock\nholdings, and explains an even higher proportion of the variance in land\nallocated, and is highly significant at p < 0.0005. The model accounts\nfor 82.9% of the variation at Sikrar, where ethnicity remains the main\ndeterminant. At Emarti, all three factors are of comparable importance\nand in combination they account for 39.1% of the variance in the\namount of land allocated.\nEthnicity emerges as the main and most consistent determinant of\naccess to land, with land received by Maasai at subdivision at Sikrar\nsome fourteen times greater than Kipsigis (Maasai = 43.6 ha, Kipsigis =\n3.1 ha), and five times greater at Emarti (Maasai = 15.0 ha, Kipsigis =\n3.2 ha). The mean amount of land received at subdivision by Kipsigis,\nregardless of location, is remarkably similar.

The\ndegree of statistical significance of each component\u2019s contribution, and of the overall\nmodel, in accounting for the observed variation in size of land holdings, is shown by the\nnumber of asterisks.\nFIGURE 3 Mean livestock equivalent per reference adult, by ethnicity\nand location\nlandless Maasai households, but 4% of Kipsigis households in Sikrar\nand 7% in Emarti reported no access to land for cultivation.\nLivestock ownership is also significantly (p \u2264 0.005) differentiated\nby ethnicity, with markedly higher levels of ownership amongst Maasai\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 591\nhouseholds compared with Kipsigis in both Emarti and Sikrar (see\nFIGURE 3). Recent in-migrants to Emarti have smaller land areas\nand smaller livestock holdings than long-term residents, reflecting the\nrelative poverty of later arrivals in this area, whether Maasai or Kipsigis.\nDuring the post-registration period, new land allocations have been\nmuch smaller in size. Land is frequently acquired by purchase via market\ndealings rather than involving new allocation. Again, transactions\ninvolving Maasai are much larger than those involving Kipsigis (see\nTABLE 8). Around one household in six in Sikrar and Emarti had\nbeen involved in a recent land transaction. Despite the small numbers,\npatterns of land transactions suggest that Maasai in Sikrar tend to be\ninvolved in deals over major land areas, while Kipsigis are involved in\nlarger numbers of smaller deals.\nTABLE 8 Land transfers reported 1996-2001 by ethnicity, Kenya (mean \u00b1 SD)\nSikrar Emarti\nKipsigis Maasai Kipsigis Maasai\nha purchased 1.3 \u00b1 1.1 21.5 \u00b1 26.9 0.12 1.2\n(n = 6) (n = 2) (n = 1) (n = 1)\nha sold 1.2 \u00b1 1.2 23.6 \u00b1 18.0 3.6 \u00b1 5.7 1.2\n(n = 9) (n = 4) (n = 3) (n = 1)\nThe figures represent the mean numbers of hectares purchased (or sold) along with the\nstandard deviation, which gives a measure of the variability of the sample around that\naverage value.

In Sikrar, but not Emarti, recent in-migrants are\nmore involved in large land transactions than are long-term residents\n(see TABLE 9).\n592 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nTanzania\nAccess to land in the NCA was governed in the past by customary\nsystems of rights and reciprocity among and between Maasai families\nand clans and sections (Ndagala 1990a; Homewood and Rodgers 1991;\nPotkanski 1994). Since Independence and ujamaa villagisation, official\nprocesses for land allocation, operating through village governments,\ninteract with and override customary channels. These processes are\noften overseen by groups that are more sedentary, with greater educa-\ntional uptake and achievement and more familiar with administrative\nsystems (see, for example, Ole Kuney 1994). Maasai residents and in-\nmigrants in the NCA apply to their village land committee for farming\nand building plots. Land in the NCA is in theory not open to private\nownership, though NCAA has granted leases to hotels and lodges (with\nno legal right to do so) and has applied for tenure rights to the Con-\nservation Area (Shivji and Kapinga 1998). Ownership of buildings in\nthe administrative centres to some extent confers de facto landowner-\nship, with land transactions couched in terms of the transfer of such\nproperty. The formal system for the allocation of land favours those\ninvolved in its organisation and is open to manipulation. The costs of\ncourt proceedings mean that wealth and patronage commonly settle the\nfrequent disputes over access to land for building. Village government\n(and land committee) membership is largely drawn from a small group\nof resident Maasai elite educated men (see case study 4).\nCase study 4: resident access to land in madukani\nSome lifetime Maasai residents have acquired considerable property\nportfolios. Four Maasai men are responsible for thirteen madukani rental\nproperties. All four are unusual in that they inherited wealth, had at least\nprimary school education and have been members of the village land\ncommittee. Men who have been Village Chairman or Secretary own the\nmajority of rental properties. Such positions provide an opportunity to learn\nhow systems work, to develop useful networks and to diversify to protect\nhouseholds from risk, such as livestock disease.\nWealthy non-Maasai in-migrants (civil servants, retired government\nand NCAA employees, businessmen) are able to negotiate from the\nland committee or buy building plots from individual residents (see\ncase study 5). Elsewhere in the NCA, similar patterns are found. For\nexample, in remote Naiyobi, in-migrant non-Maasai cultivators are\nreported to access land through patron\u2013client relations with politicians\noutside the NCA.\nCase study 5: in-migrant access to land in madukani\nGovernment employees retire at fifty-five, and older civil servants tend to\ndiversify their occupations well before retiring. Government and NCAA\nemployees have started to request posting to Endulen in order to establish\nbusinesses before retiring there. Common ventures include shops, bars\nand transport services. In-migrants to madukani apply to the village land\ncommittee for plots to build and\/or cultivate. Outcomes depend on the\ninterplay of wealth and influence as opposed to customary rights in village\ngovernment decisions. One retired government official was able to acquire\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 593\nrights to land within madukani in order to build a bar, by offering an\narrangement for cheap or free beer to a Maasai resident who was a\nknown alcoholic and had land rights. Key informants suggest this is not\nan unusual case.\nThe currently extremely sensitive nature of cultivation within the\nNCA precluded data collection on areas of farmland controlled and\/or\ncultivated during the present study. Instead, the number of cultivated\nfields (shambas) per household was recorded from key informants,\nbecause of the unreliability of individual household responses. There\nis no significant difference in the distribution of numbers of fields\ncultivated by households of different ethnicity in Endulen madukani\n(see FIGURE 4).\nFIGURE 4 Percentage distribution of number of fields (shambas) by ethnicity,\nEndulen madukani\nMost (80%) residents of Endulen environs have one shamba, and\nthe rest have two or more. However, the variance is much greater\nfor residents of madukani and for recent in-migrants. A significant\nproportion, particularly recent in-migrant kibarua households, has none\n(see FIGURE 5).\nThree-quarters of landless kibarua households have been able to\nnegotiate some access to much smaller cultivation plots (bustani,\n\u2018gardens\u2019). All kibarua households stated that they would like to\ncultivate, but some were unable to access a shamba. In recent years\nthere has been a proliferation of religious organisations in Endulen, each\nacquiring relatively large tracts of land for buildings. Key informants\nstated church membership is one way for landless households to acquire\na shamba (see Hodgson 2001), but the areas accessed are typically very\nsmall. At the other end of the scale, a higher proportion of madukani\nresidents and recent in-migrants have two, three or more shambas.\nLIVELIHOODS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA MAASAILAND\nThis section summarises livelihoods data pertinent to issues of\nresource access, exclusion and conflict. The authors are preparing a\n594 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nFIGURE 5 Percentage distribution of households by shamba holdings, ethnic-\nity and migrant status, Endulen madukani\ncompanion paper which analyses livelihood change and diversification\nin Maasailand with respect to ethnicity and migration status. Historical\ndata (Hodgson 2001) suggest this diversification has been taking place\nover many years among the Maasai, since at least the 1950s. For most\npeople in both Kenyan and Tanzanian study areas, with the exception\nof Endulen madukani, livelihood strategies depend primarily (85\u2013100%\nof households) on herding and\/or small-scale farming (see FIGURE 6).\nIn Endulen madukani, around three-quarters of long-term residents (all\nMaasai) but fewer than half of recent in-migrants (around half of whom\nare Maasai) have livestock. Sikrar and Emarti have been pooled, as\nFIGURE 6 Percentage of households reporting livelihood strategies, by location\nand migrant status\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 595\nthere are so few differences in the distribution of livelihoods by migrant\nstatus. Income streams from wages and remittance have been pooled, as\nhave strategies associated with poverty such as casual labour (including\nkibarua), charcoal and honey production.\nThe main points to take away from the summary of the distribution\nof livelihoods by migrant status and location presented in FIGURE 6\nare that:\n\u2022 People in all sites are predominantly agropastoralist with the exception\nof the trading settlement Endulen madukani, where significantly lower\nproportions both of residents and more particularly of in-migrants have\nlivestock or fields.\n\u2022 Only in Koiyaki, Lemek and Siana do households show a significant\nparticipation in tourism earnings\n\u2022 Recent in-migrants, both in Endulen madukani and in the Sikrar\/Emarti\nsites, show the highest involvement with strategies to alleviate poverty\n(casual labour, charcoal, and honey).\n\u2022 The long term Maasai residents of Endulen environs show least\nengagement with livelihoods other than agropastoralism.\n\u2022 Business and property rental are more common sources of income in\nEndulen madukani than elsewhere.\nKenyan and Tanzanian Maasai rangelands are seen by outsiders as\ndominated by people who are culturally and occupationally pastoralists,\nthemselves under pressure of invasion by farming in-migrants. Our\nsurvey suggests a picture more closely consistent with a broadly\nagropastoralist population undergoing the same general process of\ndiversification of rural livelihoods that is taking place across sub-Saharan\nAfrica (Ellis 2000; Bryceson and Jamal 1997; Bryceson 1999; Iliya and\nSwindell 1997). This is taking place alongside in-migrant households\nwith a range of occupations from poverty strategies through to business\ninvestment, depending on their circumstances. Our findings here are\nsupported by historical data showing a long trajectory of diversification\n(Hodgson 2001).\nSocio-political networks, exclusion and conflict\nBoth Kenyan and Tanzanian study areas experienced those processes\nof loss of access to resources, exclusion of the less well-off by the more\nwealthy and powerful, and ultimately the increasing tension and conflict\nthat have been outlined in an earlier section for Kenya and Tanzania\noverall. In the Kenya study areas, machinations over land by the group\nranch elites were countered to some extent by group ranch members\nenlisting the intervention of the district government. Appeals involve\ntravelling up to 150 km to Kirindon or Kilgoris District Officers, and\nrequire influence and resources, mirroring processes observed elsewhere\nin Kenya (Klopp 2001). These processes are illustrated in the following\nthree case studies.\n596 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nCase study 6: district government intervention in group ranch management, Kenya\nAt the time of the subdivision of Lemek, registered members were each\nentitled to 100 acres of fertile or 128 acres of steeply sloping\/marshy land.\nAll circumcised males deemed by the land adjudication committee to have\nbeen resident on the group ranch prior to the closing of the register in\n1993 were registered. According to Narok County Council there were 1,021\nregistered members on Lemek. Initial attempts by local elites to allocate\nlarger shares to themselves were thwarted in 1995, when a revised survey\nwas undertaken under the supervision of the District Commissioner to\nensure allocated plots were of equal size. [Thompson and Homewood 2002]\nCase study 7: district government intervention in wildlife association\/farming\nassociation disputes, Kenya\nIn 1996, a group of educated men established a Farming Association on\nLemek group ranch, independent of the recognised group ranch committees\nresponsible for controlling land allocation and for running Koiyaki-Lemek\nWildlife Association. The Farming Association land lies in the MMNR\nwildlife dispersal area, close to luxury tented camps from which group ranch\ncommittee members draw income. At the time of first ploughing, the group\nranch Chairman tried to halt farming on the grounds of conflict with tourism\non the ranch in general, and operation of the luxury camps in particular.\nThe tented camp operators also threatened to vacate the area. The District\nOfficer was called on to resolve the issue, which he did in favour of the\nFarming Association\u2019s right to generate income for its members. The tour\noperators have since stayed put. [Thompson and Homewood 2002]\nCase study 8: \u2018ethnic conflict\u2019, violence and government involvement in Narok\nIn common with other parts of Kenya Maasailand the study areas\nexperienced violent ethnic clashes over land issues, peaking in the 1990s.\nIn Emarti in 1980\u20131984, violence erupted during group ranch member\nregistration, and oral histories suggest approximately 3,000 in-migrants were\nchased out. Others stayed on, recognised by Maasai as having legitimate\nclaims. The land committee ensured physical separation by ethnicity through\ngrouping Kipsigis land titles to the west of Emarti. In Sikrar, similar violence\nerupted in 1998\u20139, when title deeds were allocated on newly subdivided\nLemek. Sporadic fighting culminated in non-title-holding Kipsigis being\ndriven out towards established in-migrant settlements to the west. All\nKipsigis workers on Lemek wheat farms and Siana tourist lodges were\nforcibly removed and some were killed in their places of work. Central\ngovernment later replaced key Kipsigis figures in Narok District, including\nthe District Commissioner, District Officer, and senior police personnel.\nLocal MPs, Maasai and Kipsigis leaders facilitated peace meetings, and\nKipsigis title deeds were allocated, again to the west of the area. Maasai land\nsales and leasing to Kipsigis have subsequently resumed. [Interview book 1,\np. 67 (28\/1\/99), p. 114\u2013115 (4\/8\/99), p. 147 (24\/2\/2001)]\nThese outbreaks of conflict followed the issuing of land title deeds.\nDuring this period in our study areas, some Maasai benefited and\nmany Kipsigis lost and were killed or driven out. In North Narok,\ncomparable clashes are generally accepted to have been orchestrated by\nPresident Moi\u2019s power brokers in a ploy to disrupt multiparty elections\nwhich threatened their power base (Klopp 2001). In other parts of\nMaasailand, the ethnic dimension to these conflicts may be a more direct\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 597\nexpression of existing tensions than a product of political manipulation.\nOur results show ethnicity is strongly linked to access to resources in\nKenya\u2014particularly land\u2014but also of relatively more secure livelihoods,\nirrespective of in-migrant or long-term resident status. For example,\n48% of Kipsigis households report some involvement in business\ncompared with only 29% of Maasai. Our sample focuses on rural\nsmallholders, but it was clear that large landowners whether Maasai\nor non-Maasai, long-term resident or recent in-migrant, were not\naffected, suggesting the class dimension overrides ethnicity and duration\nof residence.\nIn Tanzania, normal channels of representation operate through the\nvillage, district, regional and national governments. The \u2018legal quagmire\u2019\nof cumulative changes in land tenure law has left a situation where legally\ndefensible decisions with far-reaching implications are increasingly\nmade centrally without local knowledge or input. The impact of\nTanzanian national politics on local access to resources has been as\nmarked as in Kenya, and access has been as open to manipulation.\nThe situation in the NCA is even more extreme than for Kenya or that\noutlined by Igoe and Brockington (1999) for other parts of Tanzanian\nMaasailand, because the normal channels of representation and civil\nadministration are overridden by the NCAA\u2019s own powers. In effect, the\narea is governed by the NCA Authority, but this functions as a parastatal\nnot as a local government administration (Shivji and Kapinga 1998).\nThe NCA is meant to be a multiple-use area of land and the NCAA is\nmeant to have responsibility for community development and welfare\nas much as for wildlife conservation, but in practice conservation has\ntaken priority since Independence (MLNRT 1990; Thompson, 1997).\nFor most of the three decades since its inception there was effectively no\nrepresentation or consultation and a harshly repressive attitude. In 1990\nan ad-hoc ministerial commission on Ngorongoro recommended that:\n\u2022 villages should have tenure\n\u2022 the NCAA should hold regulatory powers\n\u2022 the NCAA should have no tenurial rights\n\u2022 a Pastoral Council should be constituted to liaise with the Authority and\nprovide a channel for residents\u2019 concerns\nIn 1994 the Pastoral Council came into being. In practice it is\nlargely made up of ex officio members elected to local government\npositions (Shivji and Kapinga 1998) with other priorities. Ex officio\nmembers apart, in-migrant non-Maasai have proportionally much\ngreater representation than do resident Maasai. The extent to which the\nPastoral Council operates independently from the NCAA, or represents\nthe wider resident community, is in doubt (Shivji and Kapinga 1998;\nKaisoe and Ole Seki, 2002). The Pastoral Council has functioned as a\nchannel for negotiation in some instances of conflict (see case study 9).\nCase study 9: conflict management between NCAA and residents, Tanzania\nIn 1997, NCA wardens under the head of the NCAA law enforcement unit\n598 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nattacked Maasai herders and cattle grazing in an area to which they had right\nof access. This area was near, but not in, the Northern Highlands Forest\nReserve where grazing is not allowed. Herders were wounded, their spears\ntaken, and cattle wounded and scattered. Seven cattle subsequently died.\nSome 500 warriors (moran) mobilised for conflict and the NCAA faced a\nmajor crisis. The Pastoral Council acted as a channel for negotiations, which\nresulted in compensation being paid to the owners of the livestock and to\nthe herders who were attacked, together with sanctions against the NCAA\nofficial who had instigated the attack. It is not clear, however, that the official\nconcerned was dismissed, as demanded by the resident Maasai. [Shivji 1998]\nHowever, there is considerable scope for local leaders to be dissuaded\nfrom supporting their local communities\u2019 interests (see case study 10).\nCase study 10: cultivation bans, Tanzania\nIn 2001 the NCA conservator proclaimed a ban on cultivation and the\nintention to evict all those who have entered the NCA since 1959. At the same\ntime, many migrant labourers were arbitrarily declared illegal in-migrants\nand arrested and jailed for substantial terms. Maasai elders and women\u2019s\nrepresentatives were deeply divided over the best way to respond. Local\nrepresentations to the Pastoral Council and the NCAA were not effective,\nnot least because elders were put under considerable pressure to agree with\nthe official position. It was agreed that women\u2019s representatives should go to\nDar es Salaam to petition the President, as this would make clear that NCA\nMaasai were making a peaceful representation about issues of fundamental\nimportance to livelihoods. The women\u2019s delegation made the journey, but\ncame under considerable pressure from government representatives and\nwere eventually persuaded to return to NCA without having achieved\ntheir audience.\nChurch groups, donor projects, NGOs and civil society organisations,\nwhether international or indigenous, may become informal channels\nof representation (see Spear 1997; Hodgson 2001). However, they\noccupy a precarious position, viewed with suspicion by the government\nas potentially politically destabilising, and by local people as open to\nmanipulation by ambitious individuals (see Lissu 2000). Because of\ntheir structure and composition they function more as pressure groups\nthan as representative bodies participating in local government (Shivji\nand Kapinga 1998). Some conservation agencies function not only\nas pressure groups but also as an integrated element in the NCAA\nadministration:\nThe Law Enforcement Department of the Authority is heavily financed\nby the Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS) in terms of provision of\nvehicles, uniforms and communications equipment (e.g. walkie-talkie radio\ntransmitters, etc). It is said the FZS financed the anti-cultivation operations\nof 1987\/8 during which pastoralist settlements were raided and their crops\nburnt and slashed, and nearly 25 per cent of all pastoralist leaders were\narrested and fined and others incarcerated at the behest of the MNR\n[Management of Natural Resources] officials (interviews with residents, 2\u20135\nJuly 1997 . . .). [Shivji and Kapinga 1998: 23]\nMost recently, and in clear contravention of the ad hoc ministerial\ncommission recommendations and historical agreements with the\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 599\nMaasai, the NCAA has sought title to the Conservation Area. Shivji and\nKapinga (op. cit.) point out this situation would be essentially illegal as\nit would amount to a double allocation of land rights already held as\ndeemed rights of occupancy by the Maasai customary users. However,\nthe NCAA has for some time been issuing leases to tourist hotels as\nthough it did in fact hold such title. In Kenya this is mirrored by the\nissuing of title deeds to politically connected lodge operators inside the\ngovernment gazetted Maasai Mara Game reserve (Thompson, Interview\nbook 1, p.114\u2013115, [4\/8\/99]). Maasai rights in Ngorongoro are made\nmore complex by the delicate balance between the need to assert basic\nhuman and constitutional rights, and the risk of eliciting repressive\nmeasures from an administration that feels under threat, particularly\nfrom international human rights advocacy (Shivji and Kapinga 1998).\nCONCLUSION\nThis paper has analysed the patterns and implications of in-migration\nand ethnicity in East African Maasai rangelands under contrasting\nKenyan and Tanzanian macroeconomic and macropolitical contexts. It\ncompares patterns and mechanisms of access to land, livelihoods, and\nsocio-political networks for residents and in-migrants of different eth-\nnicities in areas with strong cultural and ecological continuities between\nKenya and Tanzania. This conclusion considers the implications of our\nfindings for the role of in-migration in the moderation of poverty, social\nexclusion and conflict.\nBoth Kenya and Tanzania are seen as having been relatively stable\ndue to their comparative equality of opportunities, whether economic\n(Kenya) or political (Tanzania) (Klugman et al. 1999). However, below\nthe national level, pastoralist groups have been consistently marginalised\nin Kenya and Tanzania (Igoe and Brockington 1999; Shivji and\nKapinga 1998; Lane 1996a, 1996b, 1996c; Markakis 1999) and across\nsub-Saharan Africa as a whole (Galaty and Bonte 1992). From this\nviewpoint, pastoralist groups such as the Maasai are differentiated from\nthe rest of the national population in terms of ethnic, economic, and\nenvironmental stresses and also in terms of social services provision.\nDivergence along these dimensions has been identified as leading to\ninstability, conflict and violence (Hussein 1998; Stewart 2002).\nOur study documents levels of differentiation between and within\ngroups in Maasailand that belie the postulated equality of economic\nopportunity in Kenya, and of political participation in Tanzania. In\nKenya, processes of land allocation have resulted in many people\nkeeping only a tenuous foothold in agropastoral livelihoods, having\nadverse knock-on effects on their access to natural resources (Southgate\nand Hulme 1996, 2000) or losing their rights of access altogether\n(Rutten 1992), and being dispossessed by \u2018legal\u2019 or illegal means\n(Munei and Galaty 1999), with serious repercussions (Hodgson 2001;\nTalle 1988). Our results show the rights of some long-term residents of\ndifferent ethnicities have been less secure than those of more recently in-\nmigrant Maasai in the study areas. Kenya politicians have used disorder\n600 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nas a political instrument, raising tensions over land allocation in Maasai\nareas, deflecting discontent through attacks on vulnerable scapegoats,\nso as to manipulate election results through intimidation and ethnic\nconflict (Klopp 2001; Dietz 1996). Here it has been the well-off rather\nthan the dispossessed who have pursued violence, manoeuvring to\nconsolidate control. The instigators of Kenya\u2019s \u2018ethnic clashes\u2019 played\non existing tensions arising from rapid in-migration (Klopp 2001) and\nsystematic dispossession of poorer Maasai (Munei and Galaty 1999),\nthough many less well-off rural people resisted having their ethnic\naffiliation and legitimate concerns exploited for political ends (Klopp\n2002). In the aftermath of violence, wealth and power emerges in our\nstudy as a major dimension of resource access in Kenya Maasailand,\nlinked to ethnicity (favouring Maasai in areas formerly within the\ncolonial Maasai reserve).\nIn Tanzania, rural populations have been left vulnerable to loss of land\nand livelihoods by the confused legacy of land law created by successive\nperiods of colonial administration, ujamaa villagisation and economic\nliberalisation (Shivji 1998). Tanzania in theory gives legal status to\nsome customary land rights, but in practice disregards them (McAuslan\n2000). Central government and its representatives may legally grant\nland leases to investors without consulting or compensating the local\nusers dispossessed by the transfer. Mobile pastoralist populations have\nsuffered more than many in this process, and the events in Maasai\nrangelands have been well documented (Brockington 2002; Igoe and\nBrockington 1999; Africa Watch 1990). There have been recent\nand increasing instances of ethnic clashes over land and access to\nkey resources in Tanzania Maasailand (Otieno 2002a, 2002b; Dean\n2000; Kiondo 2002). Officially, ethnicity is not an issue: in truth,\nthe Tanzanian government regards issues, analyses and organisations\nfocusing on ethnicity as potentially destabilising (Cameron 2001).\nIn line with work by Ole Kuney (1994), Igoe and Brockington\n(1999) and Brockington (2002), our study shows that beneath this\ndenial of ethnicity as an important dimension, there are indications\nof systematic discrimination against the rural Maasai agropastoralist\npopulation.11 The virtual absence of ethnic pattern in our findings\non access to farmland in the NCA, despite the long Maasai\ndemographic and military pre-eminence in this area, underlines this\npoint. The parastatal administration of the study area by the NCA\nallows pastoral residents very limited channels of representation or\nconsultation and regularly overrules their constitutional (and human)\nrights. Agropastoralist access to education, land, and non-farm\nlivelihoods including employment with the thriving tourist industry\nis severely limited by the NCAA administration. The NCAA prioritises\nconservation (despite its brief for development) and overrides normal\nchannels and laws. By contrast, in-migrant non-Maasai appear to have\nproportionally better representation (Shivji and Kapinga 1998). They\n11 Cf. the silent discrimination against San in Botswana (Hitchcock 1990, 1996).\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 601\nare able to secure land grants from village governments and\/or leases\nfrom the NCAA, at the expense of the local rural population, despite the\nlack of any legal basis for the NCAA to issue such leases. Other aspects\nof natural resource use are similarly stacked against local pastoralists.\nLegal appeals and violent protest are on the increase, despite eliciting\npunitive measures (Brockington 2002; Lane 1996b, 1996c; MNRT\n1997; Shivji 1998; Shivji and Kapinga 1998).\nThe common predictors of violent conflict (Stewart 2002) are all\nvisible in the NCA. The ethnic differences may be silent but appear\ndeep-rooted. The economic differentials are intensifying: the relatively\nuniform nature of the long-term resident rural population is giving\nway to madukani\u2019s mix of, on the one hand, landless households\ndependent on casual labour and poverty strategies, and, on the other,\nwell-off officials and businessmen. There is a long-running struggle\nfor control of the hot spot of valuable environmental resources the\nconservation area represents. The NCA is a premier tourist destination\nearning over 50% of Tanzania\u2019s game viewing fees (Leader-Williams\n2000). It is generally understood this revenue bankrolls Chama cha\nMapinduzi, the ruling party in Tanzania, and senior representatives of\nthe NCAA have repeatedly stated its intention to restrict further and\nultimately evict the pastoralist population, despite the official mandate\nit holds for joint community development and wildlife conservation.\nThe social contract that should give people some security at least\nof human and constitutional rights is barely in evidence. Despite\nTanzania\u2019s avowed adoption of community conservation policies, this\nhighest earning of conservation areas is unable to manage community\ndevelopment so as to achieve health, education, water or transport\ninfrastructures that approach national average standards. Where such\nservices are installed they are largely monopolised by privileged in-\nmigrant elites. International conservation organisations equip, arm and\ntrain paramilitary forces used by the NCAA to control or coerce the\nlocal population: harassment is common, violence and even executions\nwell documented (Shivji 1998).\nThis paper originated in response to an increasingly strong assump-\ntion, both in the literature and among local people, that in-migration is\nleading to increased competition for key resources, which in turn may\ndrive poverty and social exclusion on the one hand, and conflict and vio-\nlence on the other. It has shown that economic and political systems that\nare relatively equitable at the national level (Klugman et al. 1999) may\nconceal marked inequalities between groups at the local and regional\nlevel. These differences are predictors of conflict but the inequalities\ndisplayed in our findings are not associated in any simple way with\nin-migration. The inequalities are shaped by national context and, in\nKenya, they show an ethnic dimension, but the overriding association\nis with wealth and power, rather than ethnicity or in-migrant status. It\nis the political economy of land appropriation which primarily drives\nconflict in Maasailand. State violence is a major contributor, causing\nexclusion, eviction and extinction of rights, whether disguised as in\nKenya, or direct as in Tanzania where a cumulative 30% of the land has\n602 EAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS\nprogressively been gazetted as protected areas in which local land use is\nrestricted or forbidden (Brockington 2002; IUCN 1987). In both coun-\ntries, state violence has been responsible for hundreds (if not thousands)\nof deaths and for the displacement of tens of thousands of people, who in\nturn become the poorest of migrants drifting through the East African\nrangelands,12 or completely excluded and camped, for example, in\nchurchyards locally (see case study 3 above), or elsewhere in conditions\nakin to refugee status, for example at Limuru near Nairobi or Malea\nnear Naivasha (Klopp 2001, 2002). Any programme aiming to reduce\npoverty, enhance social cohesion, and ultimately reduce the potential\nfor violent conflict, needs a better understanding of these processes.\nIn both Kenya and Tanzania, processes of intervention and change\nin land tenure have repeatedly allowed elites to manoeuvre to their\nown advantage. Land allocation systems have been problematic and\nconsistently work for those organising them. In both countries this\nfavours the well-off. In Kenya Maasailand, for historical reasons, this\nincludes a substantial Maasai elite and smallholder\/landowner class;\nwhile in Tanzania, few Maasai agropastoralists but many well-off in-\nmigrants dominate the process. Appeals in land allocation disputes\nare not easily accessed, are open to corruption, and plural legal\nsystems increase the chances of conflict. Dispossession and exploitation\nhave combined to initiate a political alliance among educated young\nprofessionals from pastoralist groups in Kenya. Focusing on issues of\nland, education and political representation, this forms a new channel\nto discuss and put forward pastoralist concerns through civil society\nprocesses (Markakis 1999). In Tanzania, Maasai residents have been\nisolated from and bypassed by political processes, which are dominated\nby an administration with few pretensions to balanced local government.\nThe struggle between conservation interests and human rights is unlikely\nto be resolved in any positive way for the agropastoralist population of\nthe NCA in the foreseeable future.\nReviews of tenure, access and conflict management in rangeland areas\nhave emphasised the need to foster systems for negotiated access that\ncan better accommodate multiple user groups within the social, spatial\nand temporal variability so characteristic of African arid and semi-\narid lands (Behnke 1993; Niamir-Fuller 1999; Scoones 1995; Toulmin\nand Quan 2000). However, when such different trajectories of tenure\nreform have had such comparably adverse impacts on vulnerable people\nin both systems, is further review of land titling procedures likely to\nimprove things? Any such review needs to take account of the way every\nchange has offered opportunities for the well-placed to increase their\ncontrol at the expense of the poor, not only in Kenya and Tanzania, but\nmore widely (McAuslan 2000). Pathways to reduce tensions must make\naccess to education, political representation and job opportunities more\nequitable for residents and in-migrants, whatever their ethnicity. In\nparticular, the lack of equitable and effective channels of representation\n12 See, for example, Igoe and Brockington (1999) on the Usangu Plains.\nEAST AFRICAN RANGELANDS 603\nfor both residents and in-migrants currently forms a major barrier\nto civil society in East African rangelands. This is being tentatively\naddressed through current initiatives for poverty reduction throughout\nsub-Saharan Africa which are already targeting rapid expansion of\neducation in areas such as the NCA\u2014though there are fundamental\nproblems with the lack of infrastructure and teachers (see Carr-Hill\n2002; Bishop 2003). Any results will have a long lead-in time: in the\nmeanwhile, insecurity of tenure, denial of access to the basic resources\nfor rural agropastoral livelihoods, and the potential for violent conflict\nare increasingly explosive issues which need immediate attention.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis study was financed by DFID-ESCOR grants R6828 and R7638.

Both\nin the literature and in local discourse, in-migration is presented as leading\nto increased competition, driving poverty and social exclusion on the one\nhand, and conflict and violence on the other. Current analyses in developing\ncountries identify economic differences, ethnic fault lines, ecological stresses\nand a breakdown in state provision of human and constitutional rights as\nfactors in driving conflict. The present paper explores this interaction of\nin-migration and conflict with respect to Kenyan and Tanzanian pastoralist\nareas and populations. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, patterns of\nresource access and control in Kenya and Tanzania Maasailand are explored\nin terms of the ways land and livestock are associated with migration status,\nethnicity and wealth or political class. Contrasts and similarities between\nthe two national contexts are used to develop a better understanding of the\nways these factors operate under different systems of tenure and access. The\nconclusion briefly considers implications of these patterns, their potential for\nexacerbating poverty, and policies for minimising social exclusion and conflict\nin East African rangelands.\nRE\u00b4SUME\u00b4\nLes prairies d\u2019Afrique orientale connaissent depuis longtemps une mobilite\u00b4\ndes populations, lie\u00b4e aux proble`mes de concurrence pour les ressources cle\u00b4s,\nd\u2019acce`s ne\u00b4gocie\u00b4 et de conflits pures et simples. Dans la litte\u00b4rature comme\ndans le discours local, l\u2019immigration interne est pre\u00b4sente\u00b4e comme cause de\nconcurrence accrue, motrice de pauvrete\u00b4 et d\u2019exclusion sociale d\u2019une part,\net de conflit et de violence d\u2019autre part. Des analyses mene\u00b4es actuellement\ndans les pays en de\u00b4veloppement identifient comme facteurs moteurs de conflit\ndes e\u00b4carts e\u00b4conomiques, des failles ethniques, des tensions e\u00b4cologiques et\nune de\u00b4te\u00b4rioration des droits humains et constitutionnels. Cet article examine\nl\u2019interaction entre immigration interne et conflit au sein des re\u00b4gions et\npopulations pastorales du Kenya et de la Tanzanie. Il utilise des me\u00b4thodes\nquantitatives et qualitatives pour e\u00b4tudier les mode`les d\u2019acce`s et de contro\u02c6le\ndes ressources dans le pays masa\u0131\u00a8 du Kenya et de la Tanzanie en termes\nd\u2019association des terres et du be\u00b4tail au statut d\u2019immigration, a` l\u2019ethnicite\u00b4 et a` la\ncate\u00b4gorie de richesse ou politique. Les contrastes et similarite\u00b4s entre les deux\ncontextes nationaux servent a` mieux comprendre le mode de fonctionnement\nde ces facteurs dans des re\u00b4gimes fonciers et syste`mes d\u2019acce`s diffe\u00b4rents. La\nconclusion examine brie`vement les implications de ces mode`les, leur capacite\u00b4\na` exacerber la pauvrete\u00b4 et les politiques de minimisation de l\u2019exclusion sociale\net des conflits dans les prairies d\u2019Afrique orientale.\n"}
