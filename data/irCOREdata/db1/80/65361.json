These crossings are known as\nconical intersections because the two surfaces locally\nform a double cone. Conical intersections have a wealth\nof interesting consequences for molecular structure and\ndynamics. For example, they are responsible for the\nJahn-Teller effect [1] and play an important role in non-\nadiabatic processes [2]. One of the most interesting con-\nsequences of conical intersections is the geometric phase\n(Berry phase) effect [3]: when the nuclei follow a path that\nencircles a conical intersection once and returns to the\noriginal configuration (pseudorotation), the electronic\nwave function changes sign. Since the total wave function\nmust be a single-valued function of coordinates, this re-\nquires that the wave function for nuclear motion must also\nchange sign. This has important dynamical consequences:\nit produces half-odd-integer quantization for free pseudo-\nrotation [4] and may have significant effects on collision\ncross sections [5].\nThe purpose of this Letter is to explore conical inter-\nsections of a different type. It is now possible to produce\natomic and molecular Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)\nand to subject them to applied magnetic and electric fields.\nThe atomic and molecular states split and shift as a func-\ntion of the magnetic field (Zeeman effect) and electric field\n(Stark effect). In the absence of an electric field, parity is\nconserved, so it is possible to tune the magnetic field so that\ntwo levels of different parity are exactly degenerate with\none another. However, if a simultaneous electric field is\napplied, the two levels of opposite parity are mixed and the\ndegeneracy is resolved [6]. Conical intersections can thus\noccur at points where the electric field is zero. It is possible\nto envisage an arrangement of fields that creates conical\nintersections between two atomic or molecular levels as a\nfunction of external spatial coordinates rather than internal\ncoordinates.\nAll the results that apply to conical intersections be-\ntween molecular potential energy surfaces will continue to\napply in this new situation. The internal (electronic, vibra-\ntional, or spin) wave function of the atom or molecule will\nchange sign along a path that encircles the intersection\nonce, so the spatial wave function of the condensate must\nalso change sign.\nQuantized vortices are a characteristic sign of superfluid\nflow [7], and since their first observation in the context of\nBose-Einstein condensed dilute atomic gases [8] they have\nbeen key to some spectacular experimental results [9,10].\nRecent experiments placing a BEC within a toroidal trap-\nping geometry [11\u201313] have enabled the observation of\npersistent flow around a toroidal trap [11]. The possibility\nof forming half-integer quantized vortices within a spinor\natomic BEC configuration has been investigated theoreti-\ncally [14\u201317], as have a variety of differing consequences\nof geometric phase effects in atomic BEC systems [18\u201321].\nIn this work we combine these different threads to show\nhow, with an appropriate configuration of magnetic and\nelectric fields, a BEC of heteronuclear diatomic molecules\nwill assume a toroidal geometry, such that the geometric\nphase causes the system to manifest macroscopically oc-\ncupied states of half-integer quantized persistent flow.\nEffects of this type can in principle be observed in any\nsystem where two states of opposite parity can be tuned\ninto degeneracy with a magnetic field and can be coupled\nwith an electric field. However, for atomic systems states\nof different parity are usually far apart at zero field. More\naccessible examples are provided by gases of hetero-\nnuclear alkali-metal dimers such as RbCs and KRb, which\nare the targets of current experiments. In the present work\nwe illustrate the effect for a gas of KRb molecules in a\nsingle vibrational level of the lowest triplet state, 3\u0001\u00fe.\nThe energy levels of a 3\u0001\u00fe molecule in an applied field\nare conveniently expanded in a fully decoupled basis set of\nfunctions jNMNijSMSi, where N and S are quantum num-\nbers for molecular rotation and electron spin and MN and\nPRL 103, 083201 (2009) P HY S I CA L R EV I EW LE T T E R S\nweek ending\n21 AUGUST 2009\n0031-9007=09=103(8)=083201(4) 083201-1 \u0001 2009 The American Physical Society\nMS are the corresponding space-fixed projections onto the\nmagnetic field axis. Nuclear spin is neglected here for\nsimplicity. A simple form of the Hamiltonian that contains\nall the essential ingredients is\nH \u00bc BN^2 \u00fe 2\n3\n\u0001\u00f0S^2 \u0001 3S^2Z\u00de \u00fe ge\u0002BBZMS \u0001\u0001 \u0002E; (1)\nwhere B is the molecular rotational constant, \u0001 is the spin-\nspin coupling constant, SZ is the projection of S onto the\nmolecular axis, BZ is the magnetic field orientated along\nthe space-fixed Z axis, and E and \u0001 are the vectors\nrepresenting the electric field and molecular electric dipole\nmoment. KRb has not been characterized in detail spec-\ntroscopically, but ultracold KRb has recently been formed\nin the lowest rovibrational levels of both singlet and triplet\nstates [22]. Electronic structure calculations give an equi-\nlibrium distance re \u00bc 5:901 \u0002A for the triplet state [23].\nThis allows B and \u0001 for the lowest vibrational level\nto be estimated as B \u00bc 0:018 13 cm\u00011 and \u0001 \u00bc\n\u00010:006 32 cm\u00011. The dipole moment function has been\ncalculated by Kotochigova, Tiesinga, and Julienne [24] and\nhas a value around 0.051 D near re.\nFigure 1 shows the lowest rotational levels of KRb\n(a3\u0001\u00fe) as a function of magnetic field in the presence\nand absence of a moderate electric field (5 kV=cm). At\nzero field, the N \u00bc 0 level has a single sublevel with total\nangular momentum J \u00bc 1, while the N \u00bc 1 level is split\ninto 3 sublevels with J \u00bc 0, 1, and 2. When a magnetic\nfield is applied, each sublevel is split into 2J \u00fe 1 compo-\nnents labeled by MJ. At zero electric field, the MJ \u00bc \u00fe1\nlevel originating from N \u00bc 0, J \u00bc 1 and theMJ \u00bc 0 level\noriginating from N \u00bc 1, J \u00bc 1 have different parity and\ncross near BZ \u00bc 187 G.\nWhen a nonzero electric field is introduced, parity is no\nlonger conserved. However, if the electric and magnetic\nfields are parallel, MJ is conserved and MJ \u00bc 0 and \u00fe1\nstates cross. We have therefore chosen the electric field to\nbe perpendicular to the magnetic field to induce an avoided\ncrossing between the MJ \u00bc 0 and \u00fe1 states as shown in\nFig. 1.\nWe may envisage an experiment in which a BEC is\nsubjected to a magnetic field BZ, orientated along the\nspace-fixed Z axis, which varies along the X axis with field\ngradient dBZ=dX. An inhomogeneous electric field E is\noriented along the X axis with a magnitude which varies\nwith Y as dE=dY, vanishing on a plane at Y \u00bc 0. This\ncreates a seam of conical intersections along the line 0; 0; Z\nwhere X \u00bc 0 is the position at which the magnetic field\nbrings the two states into degeneracy.

The left-hand\nside of Fig. 2 shows the resulting potential for a magnetic\nfield gradient of 5 G=cm, an electric field gradient of\n6:8 kV=cm2, and an optical trapping potential with a\nheight of 7 \u0002K at \u0003 \u00bc 30 \u0002m [25] centered at the conical\nintersection. This potential has significant anisotropy\n(about 10 nK), which is manifested as an asymmetry along\na cut with Y \u00bc 0 as shown schematically in the lower\npanel.\nThe anisotropy of the toroidal trapping potential Vtrap\u00f0\u0004\u00de\ncan be controlled by offsetting the optical trapping poten-\ntial from the point of intersection. Assuming that the\nZeeman effect is linear over the range of the intersection,\nwith respective gradients a and b, the asymmetry along\nY \u00bc 0will be zero when the optical trap is centered at x0 \u00bc\n\u00f0a\u00fe b\u00de=\u00f02M!\u0003\u00de. The trapping potential still has slightly\ndifferent depths along the X and Y axes, but this can be\nminimized by adjusting the electric field gradient. The\nright-hand side of Fig. 2 shows the resulting optimized\ntrapping potential, with x0 \u00bc 0:0715 \u0002m and dE=dY \u00bc\n6:723 kV=cm2. This potential has an angular anisotropy on\nthe order of 0.01 nK.\nFIG. 1 (color online). Energy levels of KRb as a function of\nmagnetic field B.

The lower panels show schematic cuts through the\npotential at Y \u00bc 0: KRb eigenstates (red dashed lines), optical\ntrapping potential (blue dot-dashed lines), and the resultant\ntoroidal potential (black solid lines).\nPRL 103, 083201 (2009) P HY S I CA L R EV I EW LE T T E R S\nweek ending\n21 AUGUST 2009\n083201-3\nproximate chemical potentials corresponding to these two\nAnsa\u00a8tze of ~\u0002\u00031=2 \u0004 brot=4\u00fe u0=\u00f02\u0005\u00de and ~\u000201=2 \u0004 brot=4\u0001\nV1=2\u00fe 3u0=\u00f04\u0005\u00de \u0001 u1=\u00f02\u0005\u00de \u0001 u2=\u00f08\u0005\u00de. In this approxi-\nmation, a flowing state with m \u00bc \u00031=2 is the ground state\nif 2u1 \u00fe u2=2\u00fe 2\u0005V1 < u0. For any given a\u00f0\u0004\u00de and con-\ndensate number, we can apply an offset of the optical\npotential sufficient to compensate for the anisotropy of\nthe interaction term and stabilize the flowing state.\nThe permitted velocities of the persistent flow can as-\nsume only half-integer values compared to the quantized\nunits of circulation possible in a more conventional single-\nspecies atomic BEC in a comparable toroidal geometry\n[11]. The persistent flow should be observable by releasing\nthe trapped particles and employing a time-of-flight tech-\nnique [11].\nA BEC such as described here is stable only if a\u00f0\u0004\u00de\nremains positive all around the ring. From Eq. (5), this\nrequires that a11 and a22 are both positive and that 2a12 >\n\u0001\u00f0a11 \u00fe a22\u00de. In addition, a condensate of polar molecules\ncan undergo dipolar collapse [26] if the dipole length ad\nexceeds the scattering length for the short-range interac-\ntions, where ad \u00bc jd2jM=\u00f012\u0005\b0@2\u00de and d is the effective\ndipole moment of the molecule in the field. Since the\nmolecular wave function is given by Eq. (4) and there is\na direct dipole moment matrix element h1j\u0002j2i between\nthe near-degenerate states c 1 and c 2, d \u00bc h1j\u0002j2i sin\u0004.\nFor the two states of KRb considered here, h1j\u0002j2i \b\n10\u000132 Cm, which gives amaxd \b 5\u0007 10\u000112 m. This is sub-\nstantially smaller than typical scattering lengths so dipolar\ncollapse is unlikely.\nThe present Letter has described a novel form of conical\nintersection that can occur as a function of three-\ndimensional laboratory coordinates, instead of internal\nmolecular coordinates. Using such conical intersections,\nit may be possible to create novel superfluid states with\nstable persistent flow characterized by half-integer, rather\nthan integer quantized angular momentum. Although we\nhave considered the effect for polar molecules, a similar\neffect might be produced for well-separated levels, perhaps\neven in atoms, using a laser field to bring the levels into\nnear-degeneracy and an inhomogeneous magnetic field to\nprovide a crossing. Conical intersections would appear at\npoints of zero laser amplitude, for example, at the nodes in\nan optical lattice.\nThe effect proposed here can in principle be observed in\nany system where two states of any different symmetry\n(not just parity) can be tuned into degeneracy with one\nexternal influence, and then split apart again with another\ninfluence that breaks the symmetry.\nThe authors are grateful to EPSRC and for funding\nthe collaborative project QuDipMol under the ESF\nEUROCORES program EuroQUAM.\n[1] H.
