Development of this dyadic\ninteraction is considered to positively benefit boardroom dynamics and organisational\n3performance.\nKey words: board dynamics, Chairman\/CEO relationship, narrative, philos, relational\nchemistry, sense-making\nIntroduction\nThe few academic studies that exist regarding the chairman and chief executive officer\n(CEO) relational impact on performance inconclusively show that \u2018board structure is no\npanacea for board effectiveness\u2019 (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2004; 2). From one\nperspective, academics persuasively argue for the separation of the chairman and CEO\nroles on the basis that a clear division of responsibilities better guarantees independent\naction on behalf of the board (Coombes and Wong, 2004). This supposedly allows the\nchairman and other board members to challenge the CEO without fear of giving offence\n(Coombes and Wong, 2004). In his Report of the Committee on the Financial Aspects\nof Corporate Governance (1992), Sir Adrian Cadbury recommended separating the\nroles of CEO and chairman of the board. The chairman would be responsible for the\nleadership of the board and act as the external face of the company, particularly in\nrelation to investors (Cadbury, 1992; FRC, 2003). Such division of responsibilities\nwould ensure that no one individual holds unfettered powers of decision-making.\nSeparating the two most senior of leadership roles warranted that the CEO\u2019s\ndetermining of organisational reality, or \u201csense giving\u201d, would not remain unrestrained\n(Gioia and Chittipeddi, 1991: 442).\n4With such a view in mind, UK firms have eagerly adopted role separation, up from 48.4\nper cent of boards in 1985 to 95 per cent in 2004 (Hanson and Song, 2000; Coombes\nand Wong, 2004). Essentially, \u2018decision management\u2019 is disentangled from \u2018decision\ncontrol\u2019, a necessary condition for effective corporate governance. This permits the\nchairman, and in turn, the board, to monitor the performance of the CEO.\nThe assumption that role separation enhances governance application sharply contrasts\nwith the US practice of role duality, namely the combining of the chairman and CEO\nroles in one. The alternative perspective is that by virtue of membership, US board\nmembers hold a common interest, namely the realising of shareholder value\n(Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2007). Decision efficiency, rather than the disengagement\nof decision management from control, is paramount (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2008).\nYet, with no discernable conclusion emerging over the performance superiority of\neither role separation or role duality, the framing of board issues becomes a matter of\nindividual directors\u2019 expression, advocacy, agreement as well as settlement and\nmodification of disagreement (Coombes and Wong, 2004). Thus in determining\nstrategic direction, the chairman and CEO are able to apply extensive personal\ndiscretion to their roles. (Kakabadse et al, 2006; Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2007). It is\ndiscretionary action, not governance dictate that shapes role and enterprise\nfunctionality, purpose and contribution (Parker, 1990). Only the actors in that context,\ntheir orientation and desires truly shape role and corporate boundaries.\nIn trying to ascertain whether patterns exist to executive discretionary application,\nParker (1990) adopted a role based framework and concluded that the responsibilities of\nthe chairman are to look outward and forward, whilst the CEO manages the \u2018day-to-\nday\u2019. This perspective parallels the Cadbury (1992) recommendation. In similar vein,\n5Garratt (1999: 29) named the chairman as the \u2018boss of the board\u2019, whose role also\nnecessitates to \u201cinduct, include and train to competence, each director and the board, as\na collective whole\u201d. Roberts and Stiles (1999) cited a qualitative study of 30\nChairman\/CEO dyads that supports this line of thinking. The study identifies\nchairmanship as the essential bridge between non-executive directors and executive\nmanagement. In turn, Roberts (2002) argued that the primary work of the chairman is to\nensure that the board plays a \u2018complementary\u2019 rather than \u2018complimentary\u2019 role in\ndetermining the direction and control of the company. In effect, these studies conclude\nthat wisely leveraging the discretionary component allows the chairman and CEO to\nshape appropriate complementarities of understanding so that the CEO has an\ninvaluable set of additional resources upon which he\/she can draw.\nEqually, qualitative based studies that explored the role and contribution of NEDs\nhighlight that the chairman and CEO\u2019s relationship is pivotal to boardroom\neffectiveness (Kakabadse et al., 2001; 2006). A practitioner study of 12 CEOs of FTSE\n100 companies revealed that a \u2018sound\u2019 relationship between the CEO and chairman is\nessential to the proper functioning of the board (Spencer Stuart, 2003). Prominent\nchairmen through public statements have echoed similar sentiments. For example, Sir\nDenys Henderson, former chairman and CEO of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI),\nstated that \u201cin [his] view, it is vital for the chairman and the CEO to have a close\nworking relationship which is why the chemistry between them is so important\u201d\n(Henderson quoted in Harvard Business Review, 1995: 158). The argument is: the\nsuccess of the non-executive chairman is heavily dependent on his\/her relationship with\nthe CEO and \u201cif the chemistry isn't good, the relationship isn't going to work\u201d. As a\nresult, \u201cthe board and the company are in serious trouble\u201d (Henderson quoted in the\n6McKinsey Quarterly, 2004: 67). In short, in today\u2019s business climate, the call for\nattentiveness to the Chairman\/CEO interplay has become ever more pertinent, (Sias et\nal, 2004). The quality of the relationship between chairman and CEO plays an\nincreasingly important role in decision making, information sharing, resource\nmobilisation and employee well-being (Rawlins, 1992; Wheatley, 1994).\nCognisant of the criticality of the Chairman\/CEO relationship, this paper presents the\nresults of an interpretative, qualitative study that engages the meanings embedded in\nnarratives regarding the nature of the chairman and CEO relationship. The paper starts\nwith a literature examination of the \u2018chemistry\u2019 between the chairman and CEO. We\nidentify the \u201cchemistry factor\u201d as holding a dual nature, sense making or analytical\nconvergence utilising post environmental scanning (Feldaman, 2004) and philos or\nsocial bonding (Kakabadse et al., 2006). This then leads to a detailed description of the\nstudy and the methodology adopted. The study results emphasise that the combination\nof both environmental scanning and philos establishes a \u2018collective mind\u2019 at board\nlevel. In turn, this ensures consistency and coherence of strategic pursuit. However, in\nthe absence of one of the two sides of the \u201cchemistry factor\u201d, we conclude that\nacknowledgement of the deficit and overcompensation of the remaining factor offers\nsufficient basis to foster shared ownership between chairman and CEO of the vision\nand strategy in the short to medium term. With neither present, the evident tension\nbetween the chairman and CEO undermines the fabric of the organisation often leading\nto the departure of one or both parties.\nSense-making\n7Sense-making in the fields of management and organisational behaviour is positioned\nas a dynamic process of enhancing understanding, significantly influenced by prior\nknowledge structure (i.e. schemata). This assigns meaning to new information (i.e.\nstimuli) in order to reduce the complexity of information confronting the individual and\nallows for association with past actions and meanings (Weick, 1995; Schwandt, 2005).\nSense-making as the word \u201csense\u201d suggests, involves interpretation of both the\ncognitive and emotional aspects of the human experience of interaction with the\nenvironment (Schwandt, 2005). As such, sense-making is a human cognitive process\nconcerned with weaving together a milieu of meanings, whilst having a complementary\nsymbiotic relationship with learning, where by the former provides a pragmatic\nreduction of equivocality and the latter critical reflection (Schwandt, 2005).\nBearing in mind the interconnected nature of making sense of spreads of meaning and\nthe resultant learning, studies within the UK context identify the relationship between\nchairman and CEO to entail a complex set of dynamics driven by individual beliefs,\npersonal capability and experience (Pettigrew, 1992). Although recognised that the role\nof chairman varies according to corporate context, the will to realise high quality\nrelationship between the chairman and CEO is of critical importance in productively\naddressing the magnitude of challenges facing the enterprise (Heracleous, 1999;\nRoberts, 2002). Commentators have concluded that shared cognitive commitment\nbetween chairman and CEO to a particular course of action is important for board and\norganisation sustainability (Roberts, 2002).\nYet, the question remains: how can two separate cognitions, \u2018become\u2019 shared in order\nto realise the pursuit of a common aspiration (Duck and Pittman, 1994: 680)? One\n8distinct strand of inquiry focuses on the unitary enabling effect of decision-making\nprocesses. In reaching comparability of meaning for the purpose of decision-making\nand implementation, Lonergan (1957) has positioned the \u2018lens\u2019 of experience as critical\nto determining understanding of internal organisational context against external reality.\nDaft and Weick (1984: 286) expanded Lonergan\u2019s (1957) analysis of meaning\nappreciation through their tri-partite analysis of environmental scanning (data\ncollection), interpretation (data determined meanings) and learning (action taken). They\nproposed that organisational members emerge with a will for collective action through\nexperiencing the interconnectedness of the three elements. This results in the\nphenomenon of a \u2018collective mind\u2019. The quality of \u2018heedfulness\u2019, namely detailed and\nconsistent attention to interrelational improvement (Weick & Roberts 1993) mediates\nthe migration from individual to collective consciousness through the processes of data\ncollation to action.\nWeick (1995) has further scrutinised the making and sharing of a particular sense\namongst organisational leaders. He postulated reliance on memory, driven by the need\nfor order and clarity, as a critical consideration. In so doing, he notes the relationship\nbetween social structure and sense-making as dialectical. Cognitive models that offer\nexplanation of and a pathway through events, allow for a reformulation of social\nstructures, particularly concerning roles and relationships within and amongst social\ngroups (Weick, 1995). Following this line of argument, certain scholars consider that\nthe environmental component of sense-making is self fulfilling in that people \u2018often\nproduce part of the environment they face\u2019 (Pondy and Mitroff, 1979: 17).\n9Critical, therefore, is to clarify one\u2019s own role and the identity of the group of which\none is a member. Both act as a stimulus to facilitate the learning process in order to\nattain the consensus underlying the \u2018collective creative mind\u2019 (Weick and Roberts,\n1993: 357). Sense-making is thus \u2018driven by plausibility rather than accuracy\u2019 (Weick,\n1995: 55). Accuracy requires greater cognitive investment, but of itself, does not\nprovide the emotive comfort necessary for the emergence of a common mindset in\npursuing actions under conditions of imperfect data gathering and interpretation (Weick\nand Roberts, 1993).\nIrrespective of the attraction of sense-making as a logic of shared understanding,\ninvolving activity filtering, classifying and comparing, the plausibility argument offers\na greater range of sense-making portrayals within the boardroom context (Gioia and\nChittipeddi, 1991; Weick, 1995: 51). Confronted with a variety of cues, board\nmembers notice a few, filter out others and, in so doing, exhibit an idiosyncrasy of\ndistillation, captured as being \u201csensitive to the ways in which people chop moments out\nof continuous flows and extract cues from those moments\u201d (Weick, 1995: 43).\nIn similar vein, Starbuck and Milliken (1988) assert that the extraction of data\nnecessary for sense-making requires post experience reflection. This makes the past\nclearer than the present or future in order to account for discrepancies, merge\nindividually held frames of reference and emerge with a capacity to negotiate towards a\nshared understanding (Waterman, 1990; Weick, 1995). Fundamental to attaining high\nquality board room dialogue is to engender a mindset of continuous learning through\ncritical reflection so that each incumbent is conscious that the process of meaning\nmaking is shaped and limited by their frame of reference, schemata or knowledge\n10\nstructure (Gray, 2006: 488). During boardroom \u2018conversation\u2019 where members\nexchange information and acquire knowledge, each board member, does not receive\npassive messages, but actively develops meanings, shaped by their perspective of the\nworld (Andriof, 2001). Thus, the boardroom setting represents the interests of parties\nin a manner that allows for persuasion, to persuade and be persuaded, and this, of itself,\nis purported as a primary process of sense-making (Cheney and Dionisopoulos, 1989).\nAs a result, we need to account for the dynamic and contextually idiosyncratic nature\nunderlying plausibility which is additional to the original Daft and Weick (1984) and\nlater Weick and Roberts (1993) tripartite attribution to the collective mind, namely:\nexperience (or data scanning), perception (meaningful interpretation which can be\nobjective, factual, imaginative, systemic, symbolic), and cognitive commitment (each\nindividual\u2019s thorough assessment of \u2018reality come value\u2019).\nOn this basis, plausibility takes account of the assumption that we cannot equally access\nthe three processes of experience, perception and cognitive commitment. Such\ninequality may be due to a personal or contextual predilection for environmental\nscanning, and\/or, a focus on judgement and commitment, as much arising from\nperceived enterprise threat or even a need for dominance by one or more individuals\nwithin that setting. Additionally, plausibility also refers to physical, emotional or\nspiritual bridges that are unique to the individual (Herden and Lyles, 1981; Cowen,\n1991).\nThe concept of bridging thus introduces a further dimension- that of philos. The linking\nand drawing together of relevant knowledge for the purpose of problem formulation is\none part. The other is the emotive linkage critical for the continuance of conversation\n11\nin order to attain a \u2018collective mind\u2019 (Herden and Lyles, 1981; Sternberg, 1985). The\nnecessity is to examine how the combination of knowledge sharing and strength of\ninterpersonal ties combine to form a shared vision between critical dyads (Levin and\nCross, 2004; Mooradian et al, 2006).\nPhilos Phenomenon\nThe investigation of the characteristics of dyadic, inter relationships which support learning\nthrough reflective practice for the purpose of knowledge sharing, has a long history. In the\nfourth century BC, Aristotle (1969) coined the term pathe (effect), a plural of pathos (Greek\nfor suffering) in order to define a diverse mingle of feelings that include anger, fear,\nbravery, affection, amongst others, all present within the human relationship. Aristotle\n(1969) links pathe (now more commonly interpreted as \"emotion\") as a phenomenon to\nconcrete human existence cognition. Emotion, however, bridges the gap between the\nindividual\u2019s human worldliness and their rational being. Aristotle (1969) considered that\nthe most powerful pathe occur within \u2018philiai\u2019 determined relationships. According to him,\nphilia (friendship) consists of three categories: community philia, companionship philia and\nfamily philia including marriage relationships. Appreciation that leads to a state of philia is\nnot merely the attainment of cognitive knowledge concerning the identity of the other (i.e.\nrecognition of philia) but also involves acting as a philos (friend). As such, philos is a\nfriendship between two people who share a mutual, trusting relationship, and have a strong\naffinity or preference for each other. The trust element is fundamental, for that facilitates\nepisodic mutual self-disclosure, which acts as the vehicle for learning through promoting\never freer sharing of information (Cooper, 1998).\n12\nTherefore, the moulding of philos within the dyadic relationship requires regular\nencounters, where each interaction is influenced by other interaction and together lead\nto the forming (or damaging) of relationships, constituted not only by mutual practical\ninterest but by need for mutual care (Hinde, 1997; Argyle and Henderson, 1985).\nAdditionally, frequency of interaction and similarity of perspective (world views,\nreinforcement reciprocity and emotional state) underlie the formation, maintenance,\ndevelopment and\/or demise of the relationship (Haines and Bedard, 2001).\nAlthough Krackhardt and Stern (1988: 138) recognise that organisational actors,\nparticularly chairman and CEO search for strong ties in order to ameliorate\nenvironmental uncertainty, they argue that the strength of the tie is more strongly\ndetermined by the \u2018affective (philos) quality\u2019. These scholars emphasise mutual caring\nand emotional support as opposed to hostility, indifference, dominance, reliance on\nlogic or 'friendly submission' (Krackhardt and Stern, 1988). The Krackhardt and Stern\n(1988: 138) observation that;\n\u201cIf change were simply dependant on new information, then weak ties would\nbe pre-eminent. But when it comes to major change, change that may\nthreaten the status quo in terms of power and the standard routines of how\ndecisions are made, then resistance to change must be addressed before\npredictions can be made about the success of that change effort\u201d,\nholds particular meaning for the Chairman\/CEO relationship. The view put forward, is\nthat the critical resource required to, \u201cbring about change, is trust in the propagators of\nchange\u201d (Krackhardt and Stern, 1988: 138). Krackhardt and Stern, (1988: 138)\ncharacterise trust as the \u201cproduct of strong, affective and time-honoured relationships\n13\nwhere change is the product of philos\u201d. In turn, Krackhardt (1992: 238) conceptualised\nphilos as \u201can enabling social structure for overcoming resistance to change and the\ndiscomfort experienced from uncertainty.\u201d He postulates that a lack of strong philos\nleads to \u2018pluralistic ignorance\u2019 and a distaste for learning. In such a circumstance,\nindividual board members underestimate the degree to which others share their\nconcerns. The lack of philos nurtures a climate of inhibition preventing the raising of\norganisationally relevant issues (Suls and Green, 2003; Westphal and Bedner, 2005).\nAlthough many scholars have pursued the nature of relationship bonding in a\nmultiplicity of settings (Forbes and Milliken, 1999; Granovetter, 1992; Bouty, 2000),\nfew inquiries have examined the affective components of the relationship between\nchairman and CEO. Hodgson et al\u2019s., (1965: xxi) exploration signalled a \u2018division of\nemotional labour\u2019 between the CEO and senior staff, forming a \u2018complement of\nfunction\u2019 allowing various executive and non-executive members to balance one\nanother and thus form a relatively integrated whole.\nAdopting her demands, constraints and choices (DCC) model, Stewart (1991) examined\nthe relationship between the chairperson and district general managers (DGMs) in the\nUK\u2019s national health services (NHS). Stewart (1991: 523) concluded that \u201cthe roles of\nchairman and DGM are mutually dependant, a dependency that is contextually and\nindividually determined.\u201d In similar vein Roberts (2000) argued that the\nChairman\/CEO complementarily of relationship was the prime mechanism for the\nreleasing of resources benefiting top management. Florou\u2019s (2005) quantitative study\nrevealed that the level of chairmen \u2018churn\u2019 is higher than that of the CEO when the\nchairman invoked the appointment of a failing CEO, thus emphasising the critical\n14\nnature of the Chairman\/CEO relationship. The Kakabadse et al. (2006) qualitative\nstudy of boardroom dynamics, similar to Pettigrew (1992) inquiry isolated the\nsignificance of formative context in determining the \u2018collective mind\u2019 of the board.\nThe idiosyncrasies of \u2018formative context\u2019, involving institutional arrangements, cultural\nvalues, ethnic and personal tastes, training, personal background cognitive frames and\nphilos intensity, shape the daily routines, ideology, objectives and relational capacity of\nindividuals (Pettigrew, 1992).\nConcluding that the \u201cchemistry factor\u201d results from the dynamic and ever shifting\ninteraction between analytical mindset and philos attraction (Kakabadse et al. 2006),\nwe, the authors, pursued qualitative inquiry into the relational characteristics of the\nChairman\/CEO dyad.\nThe Study\nScholars have criticised socio-psychological study of the interpersonal nature of\nrelationships for ignoring embedded social context (Grace et al., 1995), and frequently\nfor capturing \u2018first impressions\u2019 (Sillars, 1984). While the setting in which researchers\nconduct social interaction studies is rarely \u2018natural\u2019 (Kenny, 1996), it is preferable to\nuse as realistic environment as possible in order to gain contextual understanding. We\nknow that the Chairman\/CEO relationship not only co-exists within the board but also\nacross a far wider community. Of prime importance, therefore, was to capture the\nintricate web of meanings, interactions and practices that arise from shared triumphs\nand \u2018failures\u2019 across a spread of contexts. As such, the study reported in this paper\nadopted an interpretive, qualitative paradigm designed to explore the \u2018lived experience\u2019\nof the participants (Schwandt, 1994; Tomlinson and Egan, 2002).\n15\nThe aim of the study was to reach understanding of the meanings attached to the\nexpression \u2018chemistry\u2019 particularly when applied to the Chairman\/CEO relationship.\nTaking account of context, we followed the precedence set by previous studies that not\nonly the incumbents, but pertinent board members, should judge the \u2018chemistry\u2019 nature\nof the Chairman\/CEO relationship (Bryman 1996; Maykut and Morehouse, 1994).\nInvolvement through continuity of association (Argyle and Henderson, 1985; Pye,\n2001) engenders expectations concerning sense-making actions arising from restricted\nor uninhibited scanning and the intensity of philos ties (Alvarez, 2000). We, the\nresearchers\/authors, equally assumed that the roles of chairman, CEO and non\nexecutive directors (NEDs) are idiosyncratically enacted according to both context and\norientation of each role incumbent.\nBearing in mind the Van Maanen (1988: p. xi) comment that qualitative study requires\n\u2018highly contextualised individual judgment\u2019, the views and experiences of board\nmembers of nine corporations who interacted with each other over a 28 month period\nformed the basis of this inquiry. As an exploratory study of the \u2018collective properties\u2019\nof \u2018chemistry\u2019, we, the researchers, obtained empirical material through one-to-one, in-\ndepth semi-structured interviews (Fontana and Frey, 2000). This consisted of individual\nboard members, nine of whom were Chairmen, nine CEO\u2019s and forty-six NEDs. The\nnine boards were of similar size structure (role separation of Chairman\/CEO), and\nboard membership (50-75, per cent NEDs). All nine had at least one woman on the\nboard, although only one board had a woman in the CEO role. We interviewed\nChairman\/CEO dyads as well as selected NEDs holding membership to the same board.\nInterview duration ranged from one to two hours. The researchers recorded and\n16\ntranscribed each interview for analysis. The researchers achieved commonality across\ninterests through comparability of open-ended questions, freeing participants to expand\ninto areas they considered appropriate. Conducted between 2003 and 2006, the\ninterviews served as a mechanism to gather \u2018descriptions of the life-world of the\ninterviewee, encouraging interpretation of the meanings attached to the described\nphenomena\u2019 (Kvale, 1983: 174). Conscious of the perspective offered by Glacer and\nStrauss (1967), the researchers concluded that they reached information saturation after\n24 interviews, whereby none substantive data was gathered from there on. Specifically,\nour study replicated Alexandersson\u2019s (1994) findings that one typically reaches data\nsaturation in interpretative research at approximately 20 interviews, similar to that of\nSias et al (2004) who postulated that saturation takes place at the 19 interviews point.\nScholars acknowledge the contribution of role theory (Katz and Khan, 1966) and\npersonal construct theory (Kelly, 1955; Duck, 1994) in the sense that each party\nformulates relationships by the extent to which each can construe the meaning system\nof the other. So, \u201cwhat matters is not if the impressions are correct but the impact that\ncan have on other recipients\u201d (Jones, 1995: 85). Hence, the researchers asked\nparticipants to reflect on their individual experiences in the boardroom and in particular\non the effect that the Chairman\/CEO relationship had on their individual role, on\nboardroom dynamics, but also more broadly on the organisation. The researchers\ncaptured such reflections through narratives with each participant drawing on their\nexperience of the roles of chairman, CEO and NED. Any one individual may have held\nthe role of chairman in one setting and CEO or NED in another (Katz and Khan, 1966).\n17\nOther inquiries show that personal narratives provide rich sources of data in the way\nindividuals frame social experiences and the decisions that they make as a result of\nthose experiences (Harvey et al., 1990; Baumeister and Newman, 1994; Brown et al.,\n2004). In particular, Sarbin, (1986) and Sias et al, (2004) concluded that people are by\nnature narrative beings who \u2018think, perceive, imagine and make moral choice according\nto narrative structure\u2019 (Sarbin, 1986: 8). When asked to describe their experience, they\ndo so in a narrative way including information regarding their interpretation of and\nmeanings derived from the events, feelings and emotions they experience (Greenhalgh\nand Hurwitz, 1999; Sias et al, 2004). The researchers of this study acted as participants\nin the interview, and co-constructed the boardroom experience with the interviewees,\nrather than depersonalizing the interview process (King, 2004).\nThus, in this inquiry, the researchers viewed narrative methods as a valuable tool, and\ncaptured practical knowledge which enabled understanding of socially constructed\norganisational processes (Pentland, 1999; Ng and De Cock, 2002; Feldaman, 2004).\nDuring interviews, participants often disclosed stories concerning boardroom dynamics\nand in particular that of \u201cchemistry\u201d, in a non-linear and fragmented format. The\ninterviewees presented a \u2018variety of social realties\u2019 (Sarup, 1996: 12) in narrative form.\nThe researchers then had to \u2018sift through the facts to get to the real story\u2019 (Engel, 2000:\n12). It was important for the interviewers to analyse the accounts in a way that brought\nthese stories \u2018into a meaningful whole\u2019 (Czarniawska, 1998: 2), whilst preserving the\nindividuality of each participant's experiences. As the researchers subsequently\nanalysed and coded the narratives scripts, the imposition of a structure onto \u2018raw and\nfragmented material helped them make sense of participants\u2019 stories (Czarniawska and\nGagliardi, 2003: vii). The inquirers recognised that the process of narrative analysis\n18\nmay take a number of forms, from examination of the narrative as a whole (Lieblich et\nal., 1998), through to identifying self-contained story formats (Boje, 1991), to\ndetermining patterns of themes that recur in discourse (Reissman, 1993; Pentland,\n1999). The researchers adopted the third approach, since the emphasis was on\nappreciating meanings attached to repeatedly used expressions focused around the term\n\u2018chemistry\u2019, or the lack of it (Labov and Waletsky, 1967; Czaroawska, 1998). With this\nin mind, the researchers selected particular descriptors capturing participant\u2019s meanings\nfor inclusion in the text.\nFindings\nFour dominant and persistent themes emerged from narrative analysis: chemistry,\ntension, exposition and contempt. We provide illustrative story examples for each\ntheme abstracted from the original participants' narratives. Cognisant that each\nindividual experiences his or her world (in this case, boardroom relationships) uniquely\nthrough his or her own phenomena of consciousness, we are conscious that human\nperceptions are scientifically indescribable, \u2018because it is itself the world of picture\u2019,\nand that \u2018it is identical with the whole and therefore cannot be contained in it as a part\nof it\u2019 (Schrodinger, 1999: 141). Thus, our illustrations provide only a glimpse into the\nrich experience of the \u2018chemistry\u2019 factor in the Chairman\/CEO relationship. Beneath\nthe fabric of perceived boardroom reality an abstract and complex state of probabilities\nof individual interaction exists. We attempt to capture how chairmen, CEO\u2019s and other\nboardroom participants \u2018embed themselves in a linguistically generated symbolic\nuniverse of their own creation that we nevertheless believed to be an absolute\npresentation of reality\u2019 (Solomon et al, 2003: 459). In so doing, the stage is left open for\n19\nboardroom behaviours and perceived priorities to change during the firm\u2019s life cycle, as\nwell as the criteria we use to assess individual and boardroom performance.\nChemistry narrative\nThe unsponsored but recurring usage of \u2018chemistry\u2019 surfaced terms include: \u2018special\nrelationship\u2019, \u2018personal affinity\u2019, \u2018special ingredient\u2019, \u2018deep understanding\u2019, \u2018psychic\nconnection\u2019, \u2018energy\u2019, \u2018synergy\u2019 and \u2018more than professional trust\u2019. Narrative\nexplanation described the chairman and CEO capacity to interpret information and\nevents in a similar manner, both directionally (i.e. positive or negative) and in\nmagnitude (e.g. low, high).\n\u201cI quickly know what he is talking about in terms of what is right for the\nbusiness.\u201d\n(Chairman, Board 7)\nChairman, Board 7 described his relationship in terms of directional similarity with the\nCEO of another board which the chairman also leads. For Chairman, Board 7,\nsimilarity of interpretative capacity captured the essence of the \u201cchemistry factor\u201d in his\nrelationship with his CEO.\n\u201cWe can see that these two (Chairman and CEO) see the world the same\nway and like each other despite some of the abrasive comments they make\nof each other and of us. For me, no problem, as I trust the views put forward\non the challenges to the business and their significance. It\u2019s really vibrant.\u201d\n(NED 4, Board 9)\n20\nNED 4, Board 9, attributed the stimulation experienced from the \u2018chemistry in the\nChairman\/CEO relationship\u2019 to both similarity of interpretative capacity and also to\npersonal affinity (philos) enabling the construction of an experience \u201c\u2026 similar to that\nemployed by another\u201d (Kelly, 1963: 90).\n\u201cIt is a positive relationship. The two of us offer an almost genetic\ncompatibility and it is that which provides for a healthy relationship and an\neffective board. The relationship has a mystical touch. We are able to talk to\neach other and say, I feel it would be really better if you could do, or do you\nthink you could help me, and do it in a way that is not threatening.\u201d\n(CEO, Board 1)\nThe comments of CEO, Board 1 more emphasised philos, namely being supportive and\nenabling, but also refered to being understanding of varying opinions on issues and\nsponsoring open communication. Others similarly provided general descriptors of\nphilos stressing its criticality to the effective functioning of the Chairman\/CEO\nrelationship.\n\u201cThe Chairman must share a certain chemistry with the CEO, otherwise it\nwill be a tense and even unworkable relationship. However, the chemistry\nmust be of the right origin. If they share an affinity for each other, then trust,\nrespect and a desire to succeed or learn from each other, make up that magic\nin a very special way \u2013 think of Tif\u2019erath and Shekhinah.\u201d\n(NED 3, Board 1)\n21\nPositioning shared affinity as philos leads, as NED 3, Board 1 highlighted, to trust,\nrespect and learning from each other. The point is that philos is a necessary precursor\nto shared interpretative capacity. Yet, in their emphasis of philos, both CEO, Board 1\nand NED 3, Board 1, drew attention to analytical and interpretative capacity.\n\u201c\u2026 able to talk to each other; learn from each other.\u201d\n(CEO, Board 1)\nNED 1, Board 5 offered insight into the substance of philos by referring to functional\nand expressive complementarities in the Chairman\/CEO relationship.\n\u201cThey both share strong technical and verbal skills but also social\nsensitivities. \u2026 they both like to use metaphors, swap stories and generously\nappreciate each other\u2019s company but at the same they time show reverence to\nother board members. There is a certain magic between them that reflects\npositively on all board members \u2013 an enthusiasm - which I have-not\nexperienced before.\u201d\n(NED 1, Board 5)\nIn their emphasis on the criticality of the chemistry narrative, the study participants\nplaced importance on nurturing the conditions under which the Chairman\/CEO\nrelationship could be positively enabled. The interviewees distinguished three\napproaches to relationship enhancement: the selection process, role delineation and\nconsideration of other board members. Chairman, Board 2 particularly emphasised\nselection.\n22\n\u201cThe process of selection is very important but once the Chairman and Chief\nExecutive are in place, it is largely up to them to develop an effective\nworking relationship by building affective links, resolving differences in\nstyles, defining individual and shared responsibilities and understanding the\nsynergy they create.\u201d\n(Chairman, Board 2)\nSimilar to the response of Chairman Board 2, other interviewees considered selection as\nencouraging an effective generative dance between the chairman and the CEO allowing\nfor personal exploration and challenge through their shared foundation of philos.\n\u201cI would never take on a chairman\u2019s role unless I knew I could form the right\nrelationship with the CEO because otherwise it\u2019s an absolute disaster. You\u2019ll\nfind that the Chairman, if he was a good CEO and he\u2019s got a relationship\nthat\u2019s not good or he doesn\u2019t respect the CEO or the CEO is weak, then that\nChairman becomes the CEO. \u2026 That is not the case with me! And why?\nBecause there is a great deal of chemistry between us. We both have very\nsimilar wiring (interpretative ability) and that means that we flip the same\nswitches when we process information or handle emotionally charged\nsituations. We both see the same picture.\u201d\n(Chairman, Board 5)\nChairman, Board 5 highlighted that a poorly conducted executive search (selection)\nleads to role intrusion- namely the taking over of the role of the CEO by the chairman.\nTo counter that, study participants narrated shared \u2018chemistry\u2019 as analytically\n23\ndetermined sense-making which, in turn, minimises role intrusion. They reported\n\u2018interpretative ability\u2019 and \u2018information processing\u2019 as necessary for addressing\npotentially \u2018emotionally charged situations\u2019. In this narrative, they placed more\nemphasis on analytical interpretative capacity.\nChairman, Board 9 emphasised role boundary definition. The philos element informed\nthis narrative.\n\u201cEven if the Chairman and CEO define their roles, the most important\nelement in enacting their responsibilities is the most elusive ingredient \u2013 their\nrelationship chemistry. The conduct of these two individuals is evidently\npowerful. It is visible to board members and often to the market.\u201d\n(Chairman, Board 9)\nAdditionally, Chairman, Board 9 discussed the philos imperative in terms of third party\neffect, namely that on other board members. Emphasised by CEO, Board 5 is\nrespecting boundaries and being seen to offer support to each other (Chairman and\nCEO), thus acting as positive role models.\n\u201cThe relationship between the Chairman and the Chief Executive is critical\nbecause boardroom members need to interact with both of us. We try to\nguide each other but without becoming intrusive and interfering into each\nothers domain. Affection, understanding and appreciation of each other\u2019s\nviews goes a long way towards healthy dynamics.\u201d\n(CEO, Board 5)\n24\nThe study participants emphasised trust and mutual support continuity as a necessary\nplatform for openness of interaction which is supportive of a \u2018climate\u2019 of learning\n(Higgs, 2003; Otto, 2003). The interviewees focused on strong chemistry bonding in\nforming a particular conception of reality. That allowed the chairman and CEO to be\nconfident that their vision of reality was a \u2018true\u2019 one (Chairman, Board 5). Equally,\ncomments in interview highlighted the strong philos relationship between the CEO and\nchairman enabled more penetrating and meaningful boardroom debate leading to a state\nof continuous learning (CEO Board 1; NED 4, Board 9). Through confidence in the\nemerging shared vision supported by a willingness to learn, the interviewees attributed\nthe chemistry factor with not only enhancing boardroom dynamics (CEO, Board 5), but\nwith positive tangible results evident to external stakeholders (Chairman, Board 9).\nTension narrative\nThe study participants noted a vivid tension in the Chairman\/CEO relationship. This\nwas attributed to a lack of sense making, namely poor comparability of information and\nevents interpretation. However, the participants narrated the relationship as workable\ndue to the strong philos link between the chairman and CEO.\n\u201cThere is tension between the Chairman and Chief Executive, but they\nhandle themselves with decorum. They do like each other but just see things\nin opposite ways. The same word or piece of information is interpreted\ndifferently. How can I put it? If I were to show them an orange, one will tell\nyou that it is a grapefruit and the other that it is an apple. The fact that both\nare fruit does not help.\u201d\n25\n(NED 2, Board 3)\nThe respondents narrated sense-making without a shared interpretative capacity for\nlanguage, information and events but with a sharing of philos as enabling the two\nparties to evolve some semblance towards functionally complementing one another\nThe terms \u2018liking\u2019, \u2018affinity\u2019 and \u2018shared values\u2019 permitted both parties to invest in the\nrelationship. Trust of each other and respect for each other\u2019s personal integrity partly\ncompensated for a deficit of interpretative capacity.\n\u201cIf we had a shared mindset, life would be much easier, perhaps too\ncomfortable. \u2026 It can be frustrating, a lot of discussion and persuasion. We\nshare a certain affinity for each other and shared values, but not a mindset\nand approach. So, we negotiate a lot! It\u2019s down to willingness.\u201d\n(CEO, Board 3)\nWithin the tension narrative, the respondents described trust as relational, based on\nmutual respect and affection. They did not include professional trust driven by\ndeterrence or calculation. Lacking shared sense making and despite being \u2018leader of the\nboard\u2019 with the authority to dismiss the CEO, the participants acknowledged that the\nchairman is not solely responsible for the \u2018workability\u2019 of the dual relationship. As\nlong as the philos factor remained as the platform for relationship continuity, they\ndescribed the ever present tension of \u2018resolving\u2019 interpretative contrasts as resting\njointly with the chairman and CEO. Acceptance of that shared responsibility prevented\ninteractions from reaching critically damaging proportions.\n26\n\u201cYes, we liked each other (referring to a previous CEO) but just could not\nsee eye to eye. We both worked really hard to keep our differences under\ncontrol. Although all on the board respected that. It was clear only one of\nour visions would prevail, mine. \u201d\n(Chairman, Board 9)\nThe tension narrative illustrates that when the chairman and CEO do not share\ncomparable interpretative capacity (i.e. worldview), the validity or integrity of one is\nthreatened by the other which may even undermine self-esteem (Solomon, 2003). The\nstrong philos component inhibits \u2018destructive\u2019 response. That and of itself is reported as\nallowing for relationship longevity. However, this nurtures a context of extended\ndialogue that is unlikely to enable learning. Certain study participants reported strong\nrespect for the philos component, permitting them to keep within behavioural\nguidelines and in so doing, allowing for relationship continuity (CEO, Board 3). The\nalternative is unsatisfactory agency behaviour or 'friendly submission' whereby one\nparty dominates the world view of the other (Krackhardt and Stern, 1988). This leads to\na diminution of issue representation at board level (Chairman, Board 9).\nExposition narrative\nThose respondents who reported a lack of philos in their narrative, but emphasised\nshared interpretative capacity toward information and events, desired a workable\nfunctionality of relationship. The acknowledgement of \u2018it works\u2019, overcame a coldness\nof relationship or even a personal \u2018distaste\u2019 of the other party.\n27\n\u201cYou do not have to socialise with each board member outside the\nboardroom but you have to understand where they are coming from. This is\nespecially important with the Chief Executive. Liking is not the issue!\nHaving a shared understanding driven by a detailed appreciation of the\norganisation, is! Otherwise there is no workable relationship.\u201d\n(NED 1, Board 5)\n\u201cI was a senor civil servant and a Sunday Methodist preacher and he a newly\nappointed Chairman of this multi-billion pound business. After discussing a\ncontroversial issue at the time, he suggested that I should consider working\nfor him as a CEO when the position became vacant. \u2026 That was two years\nago. I think that we share an incredible understanding of the organisation\nand yet we are such different people. That shows as we do not socialise with\neach other. It is incredible that we still work together if you consider the\ndifferences in our lives, except we think in similar ways.\u201d\n(CEO, Board 7)\nComparable to the tension narrative, recognition and acknowledgement of the one\nmissing dimension in this case, philos, was reported as necessary for the continued\nfunctioning of the Chairman\/CEO relationship. Acknowledging the lack of philos and\nreliance on interpretative capacity for functionality of board relationships, requires\naccess to detail (NED 1, Board 5), particularly concerning the organisation (CEO,\nBoard 7).\n28\n\u201cFrom my experience, I think the chairman has to have an agreement with\nthe CEO, a professional understanding, and access to all necessary people\nbelow the board and the CEO. I think that is fundamentally important,\nespecially if the chemistry is not quite right and trust is hard work to\nachieve.\u201d\n(Chairman, Board 8)\nInsufficient personal affiliation was narrated as compensated for by greater\norganisational insight. Chairman, Board 8, unable to sufficiently personally relate to\nthe CEO, outlined that he achieved confidence in the relationship through seeing for\noneself the condition of the organisation via access to management and staff. A\ndetailed understanding of the organisation permits further discourse on broader issues,\nenabling relationship functionality, through \u2018fine tuning\u2019 the shared interpretative\ncapacity, of the chairman and CEO.\nWith the tension narrative, overcompensation of philos allows for a continuity of\nrelationship. Similarly, with the exposition narrative, access to considerable detail and\nseeing for oneself in order to discuss details at length allows for a commonality of\ninterpretative capacity to support continued interaction. As \u2018being ever nicer\u2019 captures\nthe tension narrative, \u2018seeing is believing\u2019 acts as the basis for the exposition narrative.\nThe study participants indicated that granular consideration of strategies to adopt makes\nmanageable an imbalanced Chairman\/CEO relationship. As Aristotle (1969) so\nelegantly noted, contemplation is the purest of human actions.\nContempt narrative\n29\nLack of philos and also low (even non existent) complementarity of interpretative\ncapacity was narrated as placing an unworkable strain on both the CEO, the Chairman\nand on the board.\n\u201cThe Chairman often gets stuck into the Chief Executive but I think that the\nChief Executive is great \u2013 fantastic. I also think that the Chairman is a good\nChairman. Yet, there\u2019s contempt between them. The relationship is just\nabout workable because the Chief Executive tries really hard by ignoring it.\nHow long this can continue is another matter, for them and for us as a\nboard.\u201d\n(NED 1, Board 4)\n\u201cThe relationship between the Chairman and me is controlled. Polite is the\nword that comes to mind. But he stretches my patience. Once I nearly \u2018flew\noff the handle\u2019, but nothing showed. Thank god. A breakdown in\nrelationship would have been damaging for us and the organisation. Things\nare not going to get better in the future. The question is; who of us will go\nfirst?\u201d\n(CEO, Board 5)\nInsufficient philos and low interpretative comparability induced comment that over\ntime and despite all effort from either or both parties to maintain the relationship,\ntermination in terms of either one or the other departing was likely, or even preferred\n(NED 1, Board 4; CEO, Board 5). Without termination or departure, the respondents\n30\nindicated that the organisation would suffer, even incuring substantial organisational\ndamage.\n\u201cIf there is no particular chemistry between the CEO and the Chairman, then\nthe value of the relationship is low and everyone feels it. Eventually, both\nbecome vulnerable and it is only a matter of time before cracks start to show\nand share price dives down. Some think it is just the board that is at risk.\nThat is not true. Cracks on the board show to shareholders, the markets and\nthe organisation.\u201d\n(Chairman, Board 1)\nChairman, Board 1 indicated that if neither side exercises the option of resignation,\nconfidence in the organisation is undermined both internally and externally. The\nprevailing view was that, in time, tension would \u201cmorph\u201d into visible damaging\ninteraction. Aristotle (1969) captured dyadic discontent as agency behaviour through\nthe use of power, position and even emotional abuse. Feeling threatened by the other\u2019s\nheld radically different view can lead to the derogation of that person in order to\npreserve self-esteem (Solomon et al, 2003). Concurrently, both parties may make\nimplicit and explicit effort to divest the other of their view through adopting a variety of\ninfluencing tactics (Solomon et al, 2003).If unable to do so, each may entrench their\nposition leading to a power struggle or \u2018war\u2019 (Solomon et al, 2003) and pursued\nirrespective of the consequences (Chairman, Board 1). Dialogue and learning is simply\nthe first casualty (NED 1, Board 4); the organisation is the second.\nConclusion\n31\nNumerous studies have examined work place relations from the quality perspective\n(Arthur and Kram, 1989), superior\/subordinate interaction (Kets de Vries and Miller,\n1985), gender (Fiske, 1993; Alvesson, 1998) social networking (Maineiro, 1994; Sias et\nal, 2004) and also the relational nature of senior management interactions and their\norganisational impact (Alvarez, 2000). However, few have focused on the nature and\neffect of the Chairman\/CEO relationship (Kakabadse et al, 2006). Yet, despite scarcity\nof inquiry, scholars recognise the necessity for mutual engagement within boardroom\ndeliberation (Higgs, 2003), particularly since Cadbury\u2019s (1992) determination for the\nrole separation of chairman and CEO. Sense-making of boardroom issues and\ndynamics, framed as the governance of corporate reputation, goal setting, risk and\nvulnerability analysis and change leadership, have long acted as the lexicon to provide\nexplanation for the effectiveness of organisational adaptability (Johnson and Scholes,\n1993). However, the conclusion of this and other studies is that consensus denoting\nagreement offers an insufficient platform to effectively confront forthcoming\nchallenges, particularly concerning the repositioning of the organisation, bearing in\nmind longevity and continued sustainability (Pettigrew, 1992). It is the bonding\nunderlying agreement that requires nurturing in order to attain meaningful consensus.\nWith this in mind, this qualitative study draws attention to the necessity for the\n\u201cchemistry factor\u201d in the Chairman\/CEO relationship, emphasising two critical\nelements: sense making, or comparability of interpretative capacity, and philos. The\nstudy participants described positive inter-relations attributed with both components\nthrough \u2018emotive\u2019 terminology highlighting the philos element, particularly the\nsubcomponent of trust and, in so doing, subsume compatibility of interpretative\ncapacity. However, this is simply a matter of expression as much determined by the\n32\nmetaphors common to that context, which emphasise exhilaration and uplift. Both\nelements intertwined prompt a colourful spread of lexicon describing the \u201cchemistry\nfactor\u201d. The study shows that desire for chemistry and the personal zest that\naccompanies this dyadic \u2018nirvannha\u2019 is repeatedly emphasised as of paramount\nimportance in the success of the Chairman\/CEO relationship. The study identifies\ndistinct strategies for its continued enhancement. These are identified as involving\nselection, role delineation and consideration of other board members.\nIf either component is lacking, the study respondents narrated bonding deficits, but\nspecified the relationship as workable as long as both parties acknowledge \u2018the need to\nwork at it\u2019. Over compensation of that one present ingredient better guarantees a\nworkable relationship. The absence of both philos and interpretative capability leads to\ndivision in the form of distaste, even despise, between the two parties. If allowed to\nfester, the participants narratives repeatedly drew attention to organisational harm. The\nabsence of \u2018chemistry\u2019 is a good \u2018way out\u2019 to precipitate the resignation and departure\nof either the chairman or CEO.\nForbes and Milliken, (1999) already established the principle of attraction amongst\ngroup members affecting their ability to work together, thus leading to higher levels of\nsatisfaction and greater cohesiveness. The contribution of this paper acknowledges\nliking, trust and personal connectivity (Nohria, 1992) as primary to philos but also\nemphasises that in top management dyadic relationships, stimulating and positive\ninteraction go beyond philos. The combination of compatible interpretative capacity,\nalready recognised as shared sense-making (Weick, 1995), and the zest and exhilaration\n33\nemanating from philos, are the primary components of the \u2018chemistry\u2019 of the\nChairman\/CEO relationship.\nThe combination of affective capital with analytical interpretative capacity for these\ntwo critical board roles, not only supports Hodgson et al\u2019s. (1965), pioneering\nconclusion of \u2018complementary of functions\u2019, but extends to enhancing the will to speak\nand the desire for freedom to act for the other members of the board. The combination\nof sense making and philos induces narrative highlighting \u2018mystical bonding\u2019 which, in\nturn, acts as the platform for what the study respondents refered to as an effective\nboard.\nThese findings deserve further in depth scrutiny through both exploratory qualitative\nstudy and quantitative survey to examine how the presence or absence of shared\ninterpretative capacity or philos between the chairman and CEO affects board and\norganisational performance. We recommend taking into account a number of\norganisational and personal demographics such as, sector, size of organisation,\nstructural configuration and age, gender, education, nationality and experience of\ndirectors. Equally, we support identifying both \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 performance measures,\nrecognising the significant impact of context in any analysis of performance assessment\n(Alvesson, 1998).\n34\nReferences\nAlexandersson, M.
