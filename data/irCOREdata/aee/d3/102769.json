INTRODUCTION \nRecently, MC-CDMA (Multi-Carrier Code Division \nMultiple Access) has gained significant interest as a multiple \naccess method and has emerged as a potential candidate for 4G \ncellular systems [2-3]. This is mainly due to its capability of \nsimultaneously exploiting the advantages of OFDM \n(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and CDMA \n(Code Division Multiple Access) to cope with frequency \nselective fading encountered in large bandwidths and thereby \nensuring very high data rates required for 4G systems. Being \nCDMA based system; MC-CDMA is susceptible to MAI \n(Multiple Access Interference) [6]. Apart from MAI, near far \neffect [6] and fast fading experienced by the signal, causes \ndeterioration in received power, resulting in performance loss. \nTo compensate these effects while maintaining reasonable \nQuality of Service (QoS), a fast and accurate mechanism of \ncontrolling the power of transmitted signal is required for MC-\nCDMA [4-5].  \nOpposed to single carrier CDMA systems, a more \ncomprehensive power control scheme is required for MC-\nCDMA, because data is transmitted over several orthogonal \nsub-carriers in this system. Furthermore, depending upon the \ncoherence bandwidth of channel the received power level on \ndifferent sub-carrier may results in appreciably different \nvalues. Hence, for a precise control over transmitter power, \nideally, power assignment must be done on carrier-to-carrier \nbasis that pose many problems (i.g. feedback bandwidth \nrequirement for transmission of control bits) not encountered in \nsingle carrier systems. \nAlthough, there has been a significant amount of work [6] \nreported into the investigation of TPC (Transmit Power \nControl) techniques for single carrier systems like W-CDMA, \nhowever very few attempts [1, 4, 5, 7] have been reported for \nmulti-carrier systems so far. Works reported in [1] and [4] \ntarget OFDM-DS-CDMA systems only and don\u2019t encompass \nMC-CDMA, whereas [5] and [7] only establish a requirement \nfor power control in MC-CDMA systems rather than proposing \nany practicable TPC technique for it. ECPC (Each Carrier \nPower Control) has been shown [1] to outperform ACPC (All \nCarrier Power Control), but concept of ECPC can\u2019t be \nextended to the system under consideration (i.e. MC-CDMA) \nmainly due to its following limitations: \n\u2022 ECPC is meant to control power on per sub-carrier \nbasis, so control index (power or SIR) needs to be \nestimated prior to combining operation [Fig. 2]. Since, \nin MC-CDMA, spreading is done in frequency domain \nusing user specific codes [Fig. 1], therefore desired \nuser data can\u2019t be segregated prior to de-spreading. \nHence idea of ECPC can\u2019t be extended to MC-CDMA \nenvironment. \n\u2022 Being uplink power control mechanism, ECPC needs \nto be implemented in closed loop [6], hence, requires a \ncertain feedback bandwidth on downlink. With \nreference to simulation parameters [Table II], a \nsignaling overhead analysis of ECPC has been carried \nout [Table I], which resulted in an unfeasibly high \nfeedback overhead of 80%, so ECPC is not even a \nsuitable TPC mechanism for MC-CDMA systems. \nTherefore keeping in mind the limitations of ECPC, this \npaper proposes a Band Based Power Control (BBPC) \nmechanism that exploits the coherence bandwidth information \nBc of channel, and controls the power of a band of sub-carriers \n(lying within Bc, hence undergoing a highly correlated fading \nprocess) with single power control command. We demonstrate \nthrough simulations that against a nominal performance loss of \nless than .5dB, BBPC remedies both of the above stated \nAsif\u2019s work was supported by a scholarship award from NCP (Quaid-I-Azam) \nUniversity Islamabad Pkaistan. \n0-7803-8521-7\/04\/$20.00 (C) 2004 IEEE\n4040-7803-8521-7\/04\/$20.00 (C) 2004 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Comparison of \nBBPC performance against ECPC and ACPC is given in \nsection IV using simulation results. This section also validates \nthe concept of BBPC using channels of different coherence \nbandwidths and also by varying the bandwidth occupied by one \nband of sub-carriers, whereas section V concludes the paper. \nTABLE I.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \nA. Transceiverr Model \nThe transmitter part of MC-CDMA for jth user is modeled \nas shown in Fig. 1. Random binary data stream is generated \nwith bit duration of Tb, and passed through a QPSK modulator. \nThis serial stream of modulated symbols is converted to P \nparallel streams   aj,p [p=0,1,\u2026.P-1] thereby increasing symbol \nduration to Ts = Tb \/P. Each of these streams is then subjected \nto spreading in frequency domain. This is where CDMA \nfeature has been incorporated; user specific codes (Walsh \nHadamard) dj,m[m=0,1,\u2026.KMC-1] with spreading factor of KMC \nhave been used. This spreaded signal consists of P*KMC chips \neach with duration of Ts. Prior to multi-carrier modulation, to \navoid burst errors these chips are interleaved over different \nfrequency carriers in Frequency Interleaving block. Finally all \nof these streams are applied to the multi-carrier modulation \nusing IFFT to generate OFDM symbols. However, to avoid ISI \n(Inter Symbol Interference), prior to transmission a cyclically \nextended guard interval of duration \u03c4g (depending upon the \nchannel delay spread) is inserted before every OFDM symbol. \nOn receiving end [Fig. 2], the received signal r(t) is serial to \nparallel converted, cyclic prefix is removed and multi-carrier \ndemodulation is performed using FFT. Prior to combining, \nfrequency de-interleaving is done. Channel Estimator provides \nan estimation of channel response Zj,p,m, which denotes the \nchannel complex gain of the (mP+p)th sub-carrier of the jth user.  \nBased on combining technique, the combiner coefficients Gj,p,m \nare calculated.

Multipath Channel Model \nMulti-path Rayleigh channel is simulated using Jakes \nmodel of sum of sinusoids [8] and is characterized by its PDP \n(Power Delay Profile). We have employed PDP given by Table \nII. Parameter KMC in this table is chosen so that the value \n\u2206f*KMC becomes smaller than the coherence bandwidth Bc of \nthe frequency selective channel (the reason for this assumption \nwill become clear in the sequel). Where \u2206f is inter-carrier \nspacing given by (4).   \ngsT\nf\n\u03c4\u2212\n=\u2206 1  \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.(4) \nIII. BAND BASED POWER CONTROL \nAs described in section II-A, data on each parallel stream is \nspread in frequency domain. Furthermore, in absence of \nfrequency interleaving; it is transmitted on adjacent carriers. \nTherefore, in absence of any frequency interleaving and by \nsubjecting the spreading factor KMC and \u2206f to (5) we can ensure \nhighly correlated fading on all KMC  number of sub-carrier being \nmodulated by a single data stream aj,p. \ncMC BfK \u2264\u2206 \u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..(5) \nTherefore, one single power control command is \ntheoretically justified for all of these KMC adjacent sub-carriers \nlying within coherence bandwidth of channel. Thereby, \nreducing the feedback bandwidth by a factor of KMC (as \ncompared to ECPC) ideally without any loss of BER \nperformance. Furthermore, by measuring the power control \nindex after de-spreading, the second limitation of ECPC can \nalso be eliminated, which is the main theme followed by \nBBPC. Fig.3 shows BBPC in MC-CDMA transmission loop. \nWe have used it in adaptive step mode which uses multi-level \npower control commands pjPcmd , for each user\n and each band \nof sub-carriers generated by Power Controller as given by (6) \n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8ef \u2212\n=\nstepres\nkSkS\nkPcmd pjtgpjrpj\n)(IR)(IR\n)( ,,,,, \u2026\u2026\u2026..(6) \nWhere SIR r,j,p  [10] and  SIR tg,,j,p  are received and target SIRs \nof jth user on pth band (stream).

SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS \nThe BBPC concept described in previous section is \nvalidated through numerous system level simulations targeting \ndifferent aspects like its performance against ECPC and ACPC \nand its performance for different channel coherence \nbandwidths (i.e. delay spread). BER and standard deviation of \nPCE (Power Control Error) are chosen to be the performance \nmetrics for this comparison. We assume one OFDM symbol \ndelay (\u03c4d = 1) in generation of power control commands by \nPower Controller and their implementation at Power Amplifier \n[Fig. 3]. All of the simulation parameters assume the values \ntabulated in Table-II unless specified differently. \nFirst of all the BER performance of BBPC was investigated \nas function of target SIR [Fig. 4] at a constant channel fading \nrate characterized by mobile\u2019s normalized speed  (FdTp) of \n0.0598 that corresponds to an average mobile speed of 30 \nKm\/hr and power control period of 0.43ms. Fig. 3 shows that \nthere is hardly any performance difference between BBPC and \nECPC, however, performance difference between ACPC and \nBBPC kept on increasing with increase in SIR target, which is \nattributed to the decreasing interference from AWGN at higher \nvalues of target SIR. \nSince for a TPC validation, its channel tracking ability is a \nkey metric, so it becomes essential to study its performance as \nfunction of channel fading rate as well. This feature of BBPC is \ninvestigated and compared against ECPC and ACPC in Fig. 5. \nThe study reveals that although BER performance of ECPC \nand BBPC is nearly identical, but ECPC outperforms its other \ntwo alternatives as far as its channel tracking ability is \nconcerned. It can also be seen from Fig. 5 that standard \ndeviation of PCE for all three TPC techniques are appreciably \ndifferent at low channel fading rates experienced by \npedestrians  (FdTp=0.00688). However, this performance \ndifference diminishes with increase in fading rates and \nBand 1\nBand 2\nBand P\nPower Amplifier\nS\/\nPBase Band\nModulator\nRandom Binary\nData Generator\nC\nyc\nlic\n P\nre\nfix\n In\nse\nrti\non\nP\/\nSIF\nFT\nSp\nre\nad\nin\ng\nS\/\nP\nHadamard Code\nGeneratorTransmitter\nReceiver\nRayleigh\nFading\nAWGN\nMAI\nMobile Radio\nChannel\nFF\nT\nC\nyc\nlic\n P\nre\nfix\n R\nem\nov\nal\n&\n C\nom\nbi\nni\nng\nD\ne-\nSp\nre\nad\nin\ng\nS\/\nP P\n\/S\nBand 1\nBand 2\nBand P\nSIR estimatorPower Controller\nReceiver\nSIR Target from\nOuter loop\nPcmdj,0 SIR j,0 Base BandDe-modulator\nPcmd,j,1\nPcmd,j,P-1\nSIR j,1\nSIR j,P-1\u03c4d\nFigure 3.

Performance of BBPC, ECPC and ACPC vs FdTp at SIRtg = 10dB. \n \nFigure 6.  BER vs carriers per band at FdTp=0.0598,  SIRtg = 10dB \nSince BBPC expected to perform well subjected to (5), \ntherefore we have conducted a series of simulations to study \nthe behavior of BBPC under channels with different delay \nspreads. The channels [Table III] for this experimentation are \nchosen to cover whole range of coherence bandwidths ranging \nfrom [ fKB MCc \u2206> ] to [ fKB MCc \u2206> ].

The performance gains is in \nterms of SNR, in the sense that with the same BER \nperformance power control scheme requires that amount of less \nSNR. The results shows considerable BBPC performance \nimprovement in terms of the achieved performance gains when \nthe channel bandwidth is above 1.8022 MHz. However a \nperformance gain of 4.15 dB can be seen even at .5418 MHz, \nwhich is considerably below the bandwidth occupied by one \nband of sub-carriers (1.8022 MHz). This gain is actually \nassociated with decreased (as compared to case without BBPC) \nlevel of correlation of the fading envelop on different sub-\ncarriers within the one band due to inefficient power control \nwhere BBPC starts acting as a means of frequency inter-leaver \n(indirectly) rather than a true TPC mechanism. \nTABLE III.

CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper we have proposed and investigated Band \nBased Power Control as an uplink power control technique for \nMC-CDMA radio interface. It has been demonstrated through \nsimulations that with no considerable performance loss in \nterms of BER and a nominal performance loss of .27dB in \nterms of Power Control Error, BBPC can reduce the signaling \noverhead to just 17.5% and 2.5 % with seven bit and one bit \nTPC command resolution respectively when compared with \nECPC which poses impractically high overheads of 80% even \nin fixed step mode. Secondly by employing the power control \nindex (SIR) estimator after de-spreading and Combining, \nBBPC successfully overcomes the inability of ECPC to be used \nas an uplink power control for MC-CDMA radio interface. A \ngain of at least 4.6 dB in terms of required average SNR is \nachieved with BBPC compared with no power control \ntechnique. \nREFERENCES \n[1] S. P. W. Jarot and M.
