INTRODUCTION\nSurface tracking along planar paths is required in\nseveral industrial applications such as cleaning, poli-\nshing and deburring of cast pieces. Often, these opera-\ntions have to be executed by robots in the presence of\nuncertainties (e.g. for the piece position and orientation,\nshape deformations called burrs, calibration errors).\nMoreover, the robotic operations should be performed\nwith a high speed and accuracy. Previous works\ndevoted to problems of such kind are [4, 5, 2, 3, 7].\nDifferent approaches have been developed, both model-\nbased [4, 5] and non-model-based [2, 3, 5], in which\nmathematical models are not present and look-up tables\nwith data are used.  A visual servoing-based determinis-\ntic approach has been proposed in [2, 3] where, with the\nhelp of a vision system, tracking and force control tasks\nare performed. The visual information is not only used\n                                                          \n\u2217\n On leave from  the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences\nto estimate the tool position around the contour, but\nalso to predict approaching of sharp edges and corners.\nThis paper presents a solution for tracking contours\nwith continuously varying curvature, based on the\nmultiple-model approach, and, in particular, by the\nInteracting Multiple Model (IMM) estimator [1, 8]. The\ncase with known initial position over the contour is\nconsidered and the continuously varying curvature is\nreplaced by discrete values within its uncertainty\ninterval. The localization of the robot end-effector over\nthe contour with known curvature and unknown initial\nposition is performed by a single EKF.\nII. PROBLEM STATEMENT\nIn many industrial applications a robot equipped with a\ntool is required to track planar contours moving with a\ngiven tangential velocity, keeping a specified orienta-\ntion with respect to the normal of the contour, and\napplying a preset normal contact force. Encoders on the\nrobot measure the end-effector's position in x  and y\ndirections.\nIn the present work the problem of tracking contours\nwith an arbitrary form, like the object represented in\nFig.1, is considered. To follow this contour the\norientation angle \u03b8 , the angle between the x  axis of\nthe absolute (fixed) coordinate system and the tangent\nto the contour (Fig.2), is estimated. The normal and\ntangential directions are denoted by n and t, respective-\nly, and  the applied force by nF .\nThe following problems are considered here: i) iden-\ntification of the contour geometry, i.e., computation of\nthe contour curvature; ii) contour profile tracking\n(following)  - the orientation angle k\u03b8  has to be estima-\nted at each time instant k , and also the curvature as a\nfunction of the arc length from the measured end-\neffector positions;  iii) localization of the initial robot\nend-effector position along the contour.\nLyudmila Mihaylova\u2217     Herman Bruyninckx      Joris De Schutter      Ernesto Staffetti\nKatholieke Universiteit Leuven, Department of Mechanical Engineering\nCelestijnenlaan 300 B, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium\nTel.: 0032  16 32 25 33, E-mail: Lyudmila.Mihaylova@mech.kuleuven.ac.be\nPlanar Contour Tracking in the\nPresence of Pose and Model Errors\nby Kalman Filtering Techniques\nFig.1.

In [4] the identified curvature values are\ntaken from a CAD model of the undeformed contour\nmodel, whereas here the results obtained by the IMM\nalgorithm are used. As obvious from Fig. 11, a quick\nconvergence toward the true value is observed.\nFig. 11 Estimated arc length shift with respect\nto the arc length estimate\n           Fig. 12 Normalized Innovation Squared k,\u03bd\u03b5\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work the problem of planar contour tracking in\nthe presence of pose and model errors has been\nconsidered as a hybrid stochastic estimation problem.\nAn IMM filter has been implemented and its\nperformance evaluated. The inherent characteristic of\nthe IMM filter gives the possibility to estimate on-line\nthe contour curvature and the orientation angle on the\nbasis of a set of values for the curvature taken from a\npreset interval. So, both contour shape identification\nand tracking are performed. The IMM mode\nprobabilities provide information about the position of\nthe tool over different parts of the contour.\nThe multiple model approach can be extended to other\nsimilar problems, such as tracking of curved surfaces, if\nsuitable mathematical models are provided.\nThe problem of localization of the tool over a planar\ncontour (estimation of the initial position) has also been\nconsidered. A single EKF is synthesized. The perfor-\nmance of the implemented algorithms is characterized\nby the normalized innovation squared test and the\nestimated variables. Results from experiments with real\ndata are presented.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nH.
