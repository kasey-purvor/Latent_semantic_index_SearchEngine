The aim of the project \nwas to better understand Scotland\u2019s aquifers, through the collation of a comprehensive set of \nquantitative data. Analysis of 157 transmissivity values, 307 specific capacity values and \n1638 borehole yield values shows that Quaternary and Permo-Triassic age aquifers are the \nmost productive, followed by those of Devonian and Carboniferous age. There is a strong \ncorrelation between specific capacity and transmissivity (r 2 = 0.8), and the former may be \nused as a reliable indicator of aquifer productivity where no transmissivity data are available. \nThe correlation between transmissivity and borehole yield data is significant (r 2 = 0.57), \nalthough the quality of the yield data is lower overall than that of the specific capacity or \ntransmissivity data. These data support recent categorization of bedrock aquifer productivity \nin Scotland, which until now has been validated only with limited quantitative datasets. \n \n \n \nGroundwater has played an increasingly important role in both private and public water \nsupplies in Scotland in recent years. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) \nestimates that there are around 30 000 private groundwater supplies in Scotland (SEPA \n2003), and the total yield from borehole abstractions by Scottish Water more than doubled \nbetween 1990 and 2005, to more than 100 Ml day-1 (Scottish Water 2005). Groundwater also \ncontributes a major component of baseflow to Scotland\u2019s rivers, supporting world-class \nsalmon and trout fishing as well as a wide variety of other wildlife. Until recently, however, \nthere has been relatively limited regulation of groundwater usage in Scotland and a lack of a \ncoherent strategy for groundwater management at a national level. \n \nThe Water Framework Directive (2000\/60\/EC) (European Commission 2000) set out new \nobjectives for groundwater management across Europe. In Scotland, it has been implemented \nthrough the Water Environment and Water Services Act 2003, which includes a requirement \nfor regulatory authorities to gain a better understanding of available groundwater resources \nand of how they interact with surface water bodies and ecosystems (Clews et al. 2005). \n \nAgainst this background, a 2 year collaborative project between the British Geological \nSurvey (BGS) and SEPA was set up, coordinated by the Scotland and Northern Ireland \nForum for Environmental Research. The aim of the study was to collect, collate and present a \nwide range of information on groundwater sources across Scotland, with a particular \nemphasis on quantitative aquifer properties data, such as transmissivity and specific capacity. \nA major component of the study was the creation of the Scottish Aquifer Properties Database \n(SAPD). This paper presents an analysis of all the transmissivity, specific capacity and \nborehole yield values held by the database, followed by a comparison of these datasets with \nthe map of bedrock aquifer productivity for Scotland (MacDonald et al. 2004, 2005). \n \n \nOverview of aquifer properties studies in Scotland \n \nDespite the widespread use of groundwater, relatively few studies have been conducted on \nthe physical properties of Scotland\u2019s aquifers and previous work at a national scale has taken \na mainly qualitative approach. Work by Robins (1990) and MacDonald et al. (2005) gives a \nuseful overview of the nature of Scotland\u2019s aquifers and of the requirements for further data \nto characterize them. A hydrogeological map of Scotland (BGS 1988) divides Scotland\u2019s \naquifers into broad groups, based on qualitative descriptions of their flow characteristics, and \nincludes the locations of known groundwater sources. This was updated to produce an aquifer \nproductivity map of Scotland (MacDonald et al. 2005), which is currently used by SEPA in \nthe implementation of groundwater strategy at a national level. The categorization relies \nmainly on expert opinion, and up to now validation with quantitative datasets has been \nlimited (MacDonald et al. 2005).  \n \nStudies incorporating significant quantitative aquifer properties data have focused on \nregionally important aquifers, such as those in Fife and Dumfries (Robins & Buckley 1988; \u00d3 \nDochartaigh et al. 1999; \u00d3 Dochartaigh 2004; Robins & Ball 2006). Until now, \ncomprehensive datasets of the type used in these studies have not been collated to allow \nquantitative characterization of all Scotland\u2019s aquifers.  \n \nDetailed statistical summaries of aquifer properties at a national scale are available in \nEngland and Wales. Allen et al. (1997) used pumping test data from more than 2500 sites and \ncore analysis data from more than 700 sites to describe the physical properties of major \naquifers, and in a similar study of minor aquifers, Jones et al. (2000) used pumping test data \nfrom more than 1700 sites and core analyses from more than 200 sites.  \n \nIn predominantly hard rock areas where few transmissivity data are available, a number of \nstudies have examined the use of borehole yield and specific capacity data as measures of \naquifer productivity (Wright 2000; Banks et al. 2005; Betson & Robins 2007). In particular, \nWright (2000) has used comparisons of borehole yield and specific capacity data to infer the \nproductivity of aquifers in Ireland. \n \nThe hydrogeology of Scotland \n \nA broad qualitative understanding currently exists of the hydrogeology of Scotland. A \nsummary of the main stratigraphic units in Scotland and their hydrogeological properties is \ngiven in Table 1, and their spatial extent is shown in Figure 1.  \n\u00a0  \nTable 1.

The SAPD provides data on nearly 3500 groundwater sources \nacross Scotland, comprising boreholes, springs, shafts and wells. It brings together data from \na range of digital sources held by the BGS, as well as nearly 60 unpublished technical reports. \nIn addition, further aquifer properties data were collected as part of the project.  \n \nThe SAPD holds data on a wide range of hydrogeological parameters, including \ntransmissivity, specific capacity, borehole yield, storativity, porosity and permeability. \nAlthough transmissivity is commonly recognized as being the most suitable parameter in \ndetermining aquifer productivity, there are relatively few sites across Scotland for which such \ndata have been collected. Borehole yield data represent by far the most commonly recorded \nparameter, followed by specific capacity (Table 2).  \n \nThis paper focuses on the suitability of transmissivity, specific capacity and borehole yield \ndata as a measure of aquifer productivity in Scotland. Statistical summaries are presented for \neach parameter. The data are also used to validate the existing aquifer productivity map of \nScotland (MacDonald et al. 2004). \n \nTable 2. Data held by the Scottish Aquifer Properties Database for each of six \nhydrogeological parameters \nParameter Number of sites with data \nTransmissivity 157 \nStorativity 58 \nSpecific capacity 307 \nYield 1638 \nPorosity 104 \nPermeability 103 \n \nData quality and bias \n \nThe data in the SAPD have been divided into three categories, based on their quality. High-\nquality data refer to transmissivity, specific capacity and borehole yield data taken from a \nconstant rate pumping test of at least 24 hours duration. In the case of yield data, the \nmaximum drawdown in the test must be less than 20% of the initial depth of water in the \nborehole. This condition has been used to limit the number of boreholes that may be \nunsustainable in the long term as a result of excessive drawdown values. Normal operational \nborehole yield data, spanning a period of at least 2 years, or spring flow data covering a \nperiod of at least 1 year, are also classed as high quality.  \n \nPumping test data that fail to meet the above criteria are classed as being of intermediate \nquality. Normal operational borehole yield data of less than 2 years duration or spring flow \ndata of unknown quality covering a period of at least 1 year also fall into this category.  \n \nData that fail to meet the criteria for the above categories are classed as being of poor quality. \nThis category comprises non-pumping test data from boreholes, which are not representative \nof the normal operational yield, as well as any borehole data from unknown sources and \nspring flow data spanning a period of less than 1 year.  \n \nThe most plentiful data (borehole yield data of poor quality) are also the least informative in \ndetermining aquifer productivity (Table 3). Although it would clearly be preferable to have \nabundant transmissivity data of a good quality for each type of aquifer, the SAPD holds no \ndata of this type for Ordovician, Silurian and igneous aquifers. \n \nBorehole yield data have been used in the past to characterize the productivity of aquifers \n(Banks et al. 2005), although there are a number of reasons why this approach can lead to \nunreliable estimates of aquifer productivity:  \n \n(1) yield values that do not meet the minimum requirements of a site are less likely to \nbe recorded (the same argument can be applied to specific capacity and transmissivity \nvalues in poorly productive boreholes); \n(2) recorded yield values are often based on short pumping tests and may not be \nsustainable in the long term;  \n(3) the yield value recorded for a site may be lower than the maximum sustainable \nyield of the borehole. This may be due to low demand or low pump capacity.  \n \nTable 3.

Transmissivity \nvalues are less dependent on borehole yield, and therefore represent a more reliable gauge of \naquifer productivity, where they are available.  \n \nThere is a clear bias in the available data towards aquifers in the more populated parts of \ncentral Scotland (in Carboniferous and Devonian aquifers) where demand is high, and \ntowards aquifers that are known to be particularly productive (Devonian, Permo-Triassic and \nQuaternary) (Table 4 and Figure 2). Precambrian and Cambro-Ordovician rocks represent the \nlargest group of bedrock aquifers in terms of surface area and cover the majority of Scotland \nnorth of the Midland Valley, but few data are available for this category.  \n \nA similar bias is likely to occur on a local scale, whereby formations that are already known \nto be highly permeable are more likely to be exploited for groundwater abstractions, as are \nareas with an increased likelihood of intense fracturing of the rock, such as valley floors, or \nthe vicinity of fault zones.  \n \nIn addition to issues of spatial bias, it is important to note that many of the recorded \ntransmissivity values were derived using only data from the abstraction borehole during \nconstant rate tests, and there may be slight underestimates of transmissivity as a result of a \nfailure to take well losses into account. Conversely, overestimates of transmissivity within an \naquifer may be caused by a greater number of pumping tests being carried out on boreholes \nwith high yields.  \n \nGeneral statistics \n \nThe distributions of transmissivity, specific capacity and borehole yield data, classified by \nstratigraphic period, are shown in Figure 3. A separate category is included for igneous \naquifers.  \n \nThe Quaternary, Carboniferous,  Permo-Triassic and Devonian aquifers are particularly \nproductive, with median transmissivity values of 350 m2 day-1, 150 m2 day-1, 134 m2 day-1 \nand 61 m2 day-1, respectively. Few data are available for other aquifer groups. The small \nnumber of data for the Carboniferous is heavily influenced by pumping tests carried out in \nthe highly productive Kinnesswood Sandstone Formation of Fife. \n \n The specific capacity data show a similar pattern to the transmissivity data, with Quaternary \nand Permo-Triassic aquifers being the most productive (with median specific capacity values \nof 283 m3 day-1 m-1and 117 m3 day-1 m-1, respectively), followed by aquifers of Devonian and \nCarboniferous age (with median specific capacity values of 50 m3 day-1 m-1 and 48 m3 day-1 \nm-1, respectively). All other groups have median specific capacity values of less than 10 m3 \nday-1 m-1.  \n \nThere are most data for borehole yield, with more than 1600 values available. Figure 3 shows \nthat the highest values generally occur in Carboniferous aquifers affected by mining activity, \nwith a median yield of 1987 m3 day-1, nearly four times the magnitude of the next most \nproductive group of aquifers. Until the late 20th century, coal mining was prevalent across \nmuch of central Scotland. In addition to increasing the overall permeability of many \nCarboniferous aquifers, mine shafts often represent complex groundwater sources, drawing \nwater from several linked adits and other shafts (Woods et al. 1999). In the absence of mining \nactivity, Permo-Triassic aquifers clearly have the highest borehole yields, with a median \nvalue of 527 m3 day-1, followed by the Quaternary, the Devonian and the Carboniferous, with \nmedian values of 190 m3 day-1, 168 m3 day-1 and 147 m3 day-1, respectively. All other groups \nhave median borehole yields of less than 100 m3 day-1.  \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n(a)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n(c)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0\nFigure 2.

Its limitations, described in more detail by \nMisstear (2001), mean that it has not been used to derive any parameter values for the SAPD, \nalthough the data show that it may act as a reasonable approximation for a range of different \naquifer types. The data suggest that specific capacity may be an acceptable measure of \naquifer productivity in the absence of transmissivity data. However, the predominance of \ntransmissivity values from single-borehole tests that do not account for well losses may \npartially account for the close correlation between these parameters.  \n \nAs only borehole yield data are available for many sites in the SAPD, it is important to \nestablish the relative level of bias within this parameter. This can be achieved by relating \nborehole yield data to the corresponding values of specific capacity and transmissivity. There \nare 302 sites in the SAPD for which both borehole yield data and specific capacity data are \navailable. The two parameters are reasonably closely related, with an r2 value of 0.62 for the \nbest-fit line (Figure 5), although this suggests a significantly weaker correlation than was \nfound between specific capacity and transmissivity. Borehole yield may, therefore, be a fair \nindicator of aquifer productivity in the absence of specific capacity or transmissivity values.  \n \nFurther evidence of this is provided by the relationship between borehole yield data and \ntransmissivity data, based on values from 131 sites (Figure 6). The quality of fit, shown by an \nr2 value of 0.57 for the best-fit line, is still significant and demonstrates that borehole yield \ncan be used to scale up the other data across Scotland.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6. The relationship between transmissivity data (including values derived from \npumped boreholes) and borehole yield.  \n \nComparisons with the existing map of bedrock aquifer productivity \n \nIn general, there is good agreement between the available data for all three parameters and \nthe categories assigned to the existing bedrock aquifer productivity map of Scotland \n(MacDonald et al. 2005; Figure 7).  \n \nAquifers classed as being of very low productivity have median transmissivity and specific \ncapacity values that are around one order of magnitude lower than the median values of low \nproductivity aquifers, and two orders of magnitude lower than those of moderate productivity \naquifers. This contrasts with the borehole yield data, in which the median values of very low, \nlow and moderate productivity aquifers are within one order of magnitude. This may be \ncaused by bias in the yield data, the sources of which are discussed above.  \n \nThe only notable discrepancy occurs in the comparison between the available transmissivity \ndata and the categories assigned to the existing aquifer productivity map. Aquifers classed as \nbeing highly productive appear to show a lower median transmissivity than those classed as \nbeing moderately productive. Further data collection may be required in this regard, to \ndetermine the robustness of the classification scheme for these aquifers.  \n \nAs well as there being a requirement for additional transmissivity data, additional specific \ncapacity and yield data would be required across much of Scotland to make the scaling up of \nthis data viable. A similar study in Ireland (Wright 2000) noted that at least 20\u201350 pairs of \nyield and specific capacity values would be required to determine the productivity class of an \naquifer. Table 4 shows that this criterion is not fulfilled at present for several stratigraphic \ngroups across Scotland. \n  \nYield, Q (m3d-1)\n0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000\nSp\nec\nifi\nc \nC\nap\nac\nity\n, Q\n\/s\n (m\n3 d\n-1\nm\n-1\n)\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000 Best-fit line\nQ\/s = 0.13 Q0.99\nr2 = 0.62\nn = 302\n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n(a)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (b)\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n(c)\u00a0\nFigure 7.

The highest borehole yield \nvalues are seen in Carboniferous aquifers, but this is largely due to the presence of old mine \nworkings, which artificially increase aquifer permeability.  \n \nSeveral factors are likely to affect adversely the reliability of borehole yield data across \nScotland, although there remains a reasonably strong correlation between yield and both \nspecific capacity and transmissivity data. There is a stronger correlation between specific \ncapacity and transmissivity data. Given that few transmissivity values are available and that \nmany have been derived from single borehole pumping tests, it may be a viable alternative to \nuse specific capacity data to assess aquifer productivity in Scotland.  \n \nTransmissivity, specific capacity and borehole yield data from the SAPD confirm the validity \nof the recent bedrock aquifer productivity map of Scotland (MacDonald et al. 2004), with a \nstrong correlation between the two. Despite possible bias, particularly in borehole yield data, \nsimilar trends are seen in all three datasets. The only slight discrepancy is in the \ntransmissivity data for moderately and highly productive aquifers, whereby the latter category \nhas a lower median transmissivity value. Further investigations are required to determine \nwhether this discrepancy is still present with a larger dataset.  \n \nComparison with the bedrock aquifer productivity classes shows that transmissivity data are \nscarce for aquifers of very low or low productivity and there are few borehole yield or \nspecific capacity data available for very low productivity aquifers. This highlights the need \nfor more reliable data, as these categories of aquifer are present across the majority of \nScotland.  \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements.
