The characteristic attenuation bands in the transmission spectrum are sensitive to a \nrange of measurands, particularly strain1, temperature1, bend radius2, 3, 4 and the external refractive \nindex (RI)5,6. Each attenuation band shows a different sensitivity to the measurands, offering the \npotential for the development of multi-parameter sensing systems7. The sensitivity to a particular \nmeasurand is determined by the composition of the fibre and its construction. Changing the \nchemical composition of the fibre allows the LPG to exhibit positive, negative or zero response to \ntemperature and strain8, while changing the structure of the fibre has been shown to allow \nenhancement of the temperature response9. In this paper we demonstrate a simple technique for \nforming a LPG with enhanced temperature sensitivity by surrounding the LPG with a material with \na high thermo-optic coefficient, thus exploiting both the temperature and external RI sensitivity of \nthe LPG. The operating temperature and measurement ranges are determined by the attenuation \nband that is monitored, and the refractive index and the thermo-optic coefficient of the surrounding \nmaterial.  \n \nA LPG consists of a periodic modulation of the RI of the core of an optical fiber. The periodicity \nlies typically in the range 100 \u03bcm to 1000 \u03bcm. The small grating wave vector promotes the \ncoupling of light from the propagating core mode to co-propagating cladding modes. Since the \ncladding modes suffer from high attenuation, the transmission spectrum consists of a series of \nattenuation bands centered on wavelengths given by1 \n \n( ) ( ) \u039b\u23a5\u23a6\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\u23a1 \u2212= iicladnieffni \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb                (1) \n \n 4\nwhere \u03bbi is the coupling wavelength, neff is the effective index of the propagating cladding mode, \nn(i)clad is the index of the ith cladding mode, and \u039b is the period of the LPG. The temperature \nsensitivity of the coupling wavelengths arises from the difference between the thermo-optic \ncoefficients of the cladding and core, while the refractive index, RI, sensitivity arises from the \ndependence of the cladding mode\u2019s effective RI and upon the RI of the surrounding material.  \n \nA LPG of length 40mm, period 400 \u03bcm, fabricated in boron-germanium co-doped optical fiber \n(Fibercore PS750) with cut off wavelength 650 nm was submerged in a series of Cargille oils of \ndifferent refractive indices. The transmission spectrum of the LPG surrounded by air is shown in \nFigure 1. Figure 2 shows the bulk external medium RI induced wavelength shift and the change in \nthe minimum transmission value of the attenuation band corresponding to coupling to the 5th order \ncladding mode. The figure shows that the wavelength response to RI occurs over a range of \napproximately 1.400 to 1.456. The upper limit is imposed by the RI of the fibre\u2019s cladding. For a \nRI above this limit there is no wavelength response. The minimum transmission values of the \nattenuation bands show a response to refractive indices in the range 1.44 to 1.456. At an external \nrefractive index of 1.456 the attenuation bands disappear, to reappear for RIs > 1.460, but with \nreduced minimum transmission. The use of Cargille oils to characterise the RI response of LPG has \nbeen reported previously5, however, the influence of the thermo-optic response of the oils has not \nbeen previously investigated in detail. \n \nThe LPG, when surrounded by air, shows a temperature sensitivity in the range of  - 0.14nm\/\u00b0C to  \n-0.34nm\/\u00b0C, dependant upon the attenuation band being monitored. This sensitivity is \napproximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of a fibre Bragg grating10. Previous reports of \ntemperature sensitivity enhancement of LPGs have relied upon the use of novel cladding \nstructures9, producing a sensitivity of 0.8 nm\/\u00b0C, or upon etching the fibre to produce an ultra thin \n 5\ncladding and surrounding it with a liquid crystal material, resulting in a temperature sensitivity of \n2.1 nm\/\u00b0C11. The technique reported here surrounds a LPG, fabricated in a standard optical fibre, \nwith a liquid with a high thermo-optic coefficient. Temperature induced RI changes of the liquid \nthen induce changes in the transmission spectrum of the LPG which, over a limited temperature \nrange, results in enhanced temperature sensitivity.  \n \nThe transmission spectrum was monitored by coupling the output from a white light source into the \noptical fiber containing the LPG (parameters as described previously), and coupling the output \nfrom the distal end of the fiber into a PC interfaced CCD spectrometer (Ocean Optics S2000). The \nspectrometer offers a measurement range of 500 nm to 1100 nm, with a resolution of 0.3nm and a \nminimum integration time of 1 ms. The fibre was immersed in Cargille RI oil of RI 1.462. The \ntemperature of oil was controlled via a thermo-electric cooler to \u00b10.01\u00b0. The wavelength and \nminimum transmission value of each attenuation band was recorded as a function of temperature. \n \nFigure 3(a) shows the shift of the central wavelengths of the attenuation bands as a function of \ntemperature, while Figure 3(b) shows the change in minimum transmission value of the attenuation \nbands. As the RI of the oil is greater than that of the cladding, the attenuation bands are reduced in \ndepth at room temperature, RT. The thermo-optic coefficient of the RI oil is negative, and thus \nincreasing the temperature results in a reduction in RI. Once the index is less than or equal to that \nof the cladding of the fibre, the central wavelengths of the attenuation band respond to the changing \nRI. Figure 3 (a) shows that each attenuation band has a different temperature sensitivity, and that, \nover a limited range, very high temperature sensitivities are achieved (up to 19.2nm\/\u00b0C over a \ntemperature range of 1.1\u00b0C).  It is also interesting to note that the temperature range is different for \neach attenuation band. This is a result of the dispersion of the RI oil and of the cladding of the \nfibre. The depth of the attenuation band also demonstrates a large temperature sensitivity of up to \n 6\n14.8 % \/\u00b0C over a temperature range of 2.0\u00b0C, and again, offers different operating ranges for the \ndifferent attenuation bands. \n \nIf a different operating range is required, it is possible to choose a material with a different RI at \nroom temperature, such that its RI lies within the sensitivity range of the LPG over a different \nrange of temperatures. This is illustrated by the results shown in figure 4, where the temperature \nresponses of the attenuation band corresponding to coupling to the 5th cladding mode surrounded \nby two different RI oils (n = 1.460, n =1.462) are compared, demonstrating the tuning of the \noperating temperature range by change of material.  \n \nThe measurements reported were found to be reproducible and no hysteresis was observed during \ntemperature cycling. The temperature sensitivity enhancement discussed here would be of use in \ntemperature critical systems, for example in chemical and material processing, where optimum \nprocessing temperature range may be limited. In addition, the high temperature sensitivity is of \ninterest for thermally tuned optical filters. \n \nIn summary, a method for enhancing the temperature sensitivity of a LPG has been discussed. The \nLPG, fabricated in standard optical fibre, is surrounded by a Cargille refractive index oil with a \nhigh thermo-optic coefficient. There is no requirement for novel coating materials or novel fibre \nstructures. A sensor based upon this principal could be readily constructed using a tube filled with \nthe appropriate oil. The tube would also provide support for the LPG, avoiding bending induced \nchanges to the transmission spectrum2-4. The LPG exhibits a temperature sensitivity of 19.2nm\/\u00b0C \nover a temperature range of 1.1\u00b0C. Monitoring a number of the attenuation bands in the spectrum \nof a single LPG allows measurements to be performed over different temperature ranges. The \noperating temperature and the sensitivity are determined by the properties of the surrounding oil, \n 7\nallowing optimisation of the sensor for a given application. The results presented also show that \ngreat care must be taken when using LPG to measure the refractive index of materials that change \nwith large thermo-optic coefficients. \n \nThe authors acknowledge support of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, \nU.K., GR\/M87337\/01, the Royal Society, U.K. and Dr. David.
