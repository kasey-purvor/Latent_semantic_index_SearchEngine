A. Tass, Springer, Berlin, 2007, pp.\nxii + 329. Scope: monograph. Level: postgraduate, medical professional.\nOscillatory processes abound in both physics and the human body, as well as in science\nmore generally. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that advances in the physics of coupled\noscillators are illuminating phenomena observed in biology and other areas of science.\nThey are also leading to new forms of medical treatment, e.g. methods of controlling or\nlargely eliminating the limb tremor seen in epilepsy through carefully tailored deep-brain\nstimulation.\nThis is a paperback reprint of Tass\u2019s book from the Springer Series in Synergetics, first\npublished in 1999. It concentrates on the physics of ensembles of oscillators, suitable for\ndescribing neurons in the brain or excitable cells in the heart. The basics are discussed\nin detail, together with a number of actual and potential applications. In the applica-\ntion to epilepsy, for example, the idea is to terminate an undesirable brain oscillation\nin which many the oscillators (neurons) act in synchrony within a certain part of the\nbrain. The approach now used is first to apply a strong oscillatory pulse to completely\nphase-synchronize all of the oscillators in question, followed by a gentler pulse during the\n\u201cvulnerable\u201d part of their cycle to ensure that they then become totally desynchronised;\nthe process is then repeated, a little later, as the pathological oscillation gradually starts\nto reassert itself. It works, and in fact there has been significant clinical development\nsince the book first appeared.\nThe text will be of interest to postgraduate physists as well as to physiologists, medical\nscientists and clinical practioners with a good mathematical background. It is well-written\nand logically structured, and is likely to be useful and popular among a wider audience\nthat the earlier hardback edition.\nPeter V. E.
