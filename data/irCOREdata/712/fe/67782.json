INTRODUCTION \nElectromagnetic induction tomography (EMT) images the\nspatial distribution of electrical conductivity and\/or magnetic\npermeability inside a region of interest by obtaining a set of\nmeasurements using inductive coils that are distributed\naround the periphery. This form of tomography is non-\nintrusive and non-invasive such that the sensor coils are\nlocated external to the process or target. The systems operate \nby typically applying a set of interrogating field patterns to\nthe region from different locations and directions. A number\nof measurements are taken by an array of sensors for each \npattern. The measured data is then manipulated using\nmathematical inversion techniques to create an image of the \ninternal object distribution. Areas of application for this\ntechnique include metal production, especially molten metal\nprocesses, and non-destructive testing [1-3]. Image resolution\nis poor compared to many other forms of tomography\nbecause of the limited number of excitation and detection\ncoils and the nature of low frequency EM fields. However,\nfor some of these applications it is sufficient simply to\nidentify highly conductive regions within the object space \nsuch as whether a flow of molten is steel is biased towards\none side of a delivery nozzle or is evenly distributed over the\ncross-section. In other cases, more information is required\nabout the object distribution. A challenge in EMT is to image\ninternal structure within complex object distributions.\nA particularly difficult case is to discern internal structure \nat the centre of the object space when the material at the outer \nregions is conductive. This is because the outer material acts\nas an electromagnetic screen, which partially excludes the\nmagnetic field from the interior space and hence reduces the \nsensitivity at the centre. A practical example of this situation\nis distinguishing between an annular flow of liquid metal and\none where the nozzle is completely filled. Other possible\napplications include non-destructive testing during the\nproduction of pipes to detect internal defects.\nThis paper considers a simple test case of an annular\nobject with internal conductive objects.\nII. METHODOLOGIES\nA. Forward modelling\nThe forward problem in EMT is a classical eddy current\nproblem. This problem can be formulated in terms of the\nmagnetic vector potential A for the sinusoidal waveform\nexcitation cases using complex phasor notation\ns\u00b5\n1 JA\u0226\u0131i)A(  \u000eu\u0092u\u0092                       (1) \nwhere  is electrical conductivity, \u00b5  is magnetic\npermeability and Js is the applied current density in an\nexcitation coil.\n\u0131\nThe penetration of magnetic field below a test object\nsurface is described by the penetration depth G, which is \ndefined as \u00b5\u0131f\u028c1\u012f  , where f is the excitation frequency. \nFor non-magnetic, electrically conductive metals, the\npermeability \u00b5 virtually equals to the permeability of free \nspace, \u00b50, i.e., 4\u028c x 10-7 H\/m. In fact, at an operating \nfrequency of 5 kHz, the penetration depth for copper (V | 58 \nMS\/m) is about 0.93 mm which means that for a copper tube,\nfor instance 2 mm thick, the field strength at the inside\nsurface is roughly 16% of the field strength at the outside \nsurface. Therefore, the field strength decreases significantly \non the surface of an internal object when placed coaxially in\nthe tube.\nFig. 1 shows a diagram of the sensor array of an EMT\nsystem that is used in this study. The sensor array contains\neight wire wound coils (50 turns and 50 cm diameter), which\nare equally spaced along the periphery of an object space \nbeing imaged. The region of interest is a circular object space \nwith a radius of 80 mm. The distance between centres of two\nopposite coils is therefore 160 mm. To investigate the\n2990-7803-9360-0\/06\/$20.00 \u00a92006 IEEE\npossibility of imaging annular objects, the 8-coil sensor array \nwas electromagnetically simulated with commercially\navailable software (Ansoft Cooperation\u2019s Maxwell 3D EM\nfield simulator). This software offered a piecewise solution to\nfield problems by splitting the problem into a series of small\ntetrahedral elements over which the field values are \napproximated. The geometry being simulated includes an \nexternal tube of 140 mm diameter and 50 \u00b5m thick with\ncircular rods placed inside the tube to represent internal \nstructure. The objects were assigned the material property of \ncopper.\nCoil 8Coil 6\nCoil 2 Coil 4 \nCoil 1 Coil 5 \nCoil 3\nCoil 7\nX-Axis\nY\n-A\nx\nis\n80 mm\n80 mm \nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of sensor array used in the study\nSimulations were carried out to assess how the coil outputs\nchange with the diameter of the internal rod for a fixed size of \nthe external tube with an excitation frequency of 5 kHz. Fig.\n2 shows the changes in mutual impedance (imaginary part)\nwith the radius of the internal rod measured on the coil 5\nwhen coil 1 is excited. The background value is 0.0319 m\u020d\nwhen only the tube is present inside the object space. The \nquantization noise level of the system being simulated is\n0.0024 m\u020d for this opposite coil pair. This indicates that such \na copper rod with a radius larger than 7.5 mm is resolved and \ntherefore can be imaged when present inside a thin copper \ntube (140 mm diameter and 50 \u00b5m thick).\nThe relationship between them can be fitted numerically\nwith a polynomial expression\n254 r1062.1r109.30315.0Z \u0010\u0010 u\u000eu\u000e    (2) \nTherefore, the above quadratic expression can be used to\napproximately describe how the imaginary mutual coupling\n(Z) changes with the radius r of the internal rod. \nB. Sensitivity analysis \nIf the total current in the excitation coil is , the \nsensitivity of the induced voltage to the conductivity is [4-5] \n0I\n0\nkD\nji\n2\nk\nij\nI\ndvA.A\n\u0226\n\u0131\nV\n\u00b3\n:\n\u0010 \nw\nw\n                      (3) \nwhere kD:  is the volume of the perturbation, A and A  are \nthe solution of the forward solver when excitation coil ( ) is \nexcited by\ni j\ni\n0I and sensing coil ( ) is  excited withj unit\ncurrent.\nThe sensitivity map changes with the background\nconductivity. Fig. 3 (upper) shows sensitivity plot of opposite\ncoils when a homogenous background (a cylinder of V = 0.4 \nS\/m with 140 mm in diameter and 140 mm in length) is\npresent. Fig. 3 (lower) is the sensitivity map between\nopposite coils when a tube with conductivity of 3 times\nbigger than the background is present, where the outer and \ninner radii of the ring object are 65 mm and 50 mm\nrespectively. With a conductive background close to the\nsurface, higher eddy currents are induced, which means that \nthose areas have higher sensitivity. In homogenous\nbackground, the pixel intensity at the centre in the sensitivity \nmap is around 0.8 \u00d7 10-12 compared to 2.4 \u00d7 10-12 at the \nsurface; whereas in a background with a conductive tube \npresent the pixel intensity at the centre is around 0.8 \u00d7 10-12\ncompared to 8 \u00d7 10-12 at the surface of the tube.\nObviously, the two sensitivity maps show that a much\nhigher sensitivity contrast is produced in the object space \nwhen the background is conductive tube. As a result, a\nbackground with a conductive tube present raises a more ill-\nposed problem than a homogeneous background, making it\ndifficult to image the internal structure. \nFig. 2 Changes in mutual coupling (imaginary part) of coil pairs with\nthe size of internal rod when coil 1 is excited under the excitation \nfrequency of 5 kHz \n300\nFig. 3 Sensitivity in conductivity of opposite coils changes with\ndifferent background, (upper) homogeneous background, and (lower)\nwith a ring shape conductive object as a background. All dimensions \nin X and Y directions are in m \nC. Image reconstruction\nIn image reconstruction, both linear and non-linear\nalgorithms were considered. The linear method is based on \nTikhonov regularization, which uses a universal\nregularization technique for solving the ill-posed inverse\nproblem in the following manner:\nzJ)I\u00b5JJ(x T1T \u0010\u000e (4)\nwhere x is the image pixel vector, z is the measurement\nvector, J is the sensitivity matrix (Jacobian matrix), I is an\nidentity matrix and P is the regularization parameter. In this\nsingle-step algorithm, sensitivity matrix J was obtained with\na direct measurement method [6].\nThe inverse problem in 3D eddy current imaging is both\nill-posed and non-linear. As an iterative reconstruction\nalgorithm, the regularised Gauss-Newton method starts with\nan initial conductivity distribution . The forward problem\nis solved using edge finite element method and the predicted\nvoltages compared with the calculated voltages from the\nforward model. The conductivity is then updated. The process\nis repeated until the predicted voltages from the finite\nelement method agree with the calculated voltages from the\nfinite element model to the required measurement precision \n[7]. The update formula at step n+1 is,\n0\u0131\n)\u0131RR\u012e))\u0131(Fz(J()RR\u012eJJ(\u0131\u0131 n\nT2\nn\nT\nn\n1T2\nn\nT\nnn1n \u0010\u0010\u000e\u000e \n\u0010\n\u000e    (5) \nwhere Jn is the sensitivity matrix updated with the \nconductivity \u0131n, the forward solution F(\u0131n ) is the predicted\nvoltages from the FE model with conductivity \u0131n. The matrix\n\u012e2RTR is a regularization matrix, where R is a discrete\napproximate to the Laplace operator. The parameter \u012e is a\nregularisation parameter, which penalises extreme changes in\nconductivity removing the instability in the reconstruction, at \nthe cost of producing artificially smooth images.\nIII.

The system is controlled by a \nmultifunction data acquisition board (ADLINK DAQ2205), \nwhich is housed inside the PC. The excitation coil is supplied\nfrom an a.c. current source with a peak current of 0.5 A. The \nconditioning electronics allows the driving\/switching of the\ncurrent source to each excitation coil in sequence, controls \nthe gain selection for the induced voltage amplification,\ndemodulates the induced voltage from the detection coils\nderiving both in-phase (real) and quadrature (imaginary)\ncomponents.\nEach coil is excited at an operation frequency of 5 kHz in\nturn as controlled by software and the induced voltages are\nthen measured at the remaining coils. The imaginary parts of\nthe induced voltage have been used for the conductivity\nimage reconstruction, as they produce larger voltages, hence\nimprove signal to noise ratio (SNR).\nB. Imaging results\nFig. 5(a) shows the reconstructed image of a copper tube\nalone, where the tube is 140 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm\n301\nthick. The images of the tube with a copper rod of 35 mm, 19 \nmm and 9 mm in diameter inside are illustrated in figures\n5(b), (c) and (d) respectively by using the linear algorithm in\nequation (4). The regularization parameter P was chosen \n5\u00d710-5. Apparently, the presence of a smaller rod inside the \ntube will generate a smaller signal, which is superimposed to\nthe much stronger signal generated by the tube, making it\ndifficult to image the internal rod.\n         (a)                   (b)\n (c)                 (d)\nFig. 5 Image reconstruction of copper tube with copper rod, (a) tube \nalone, (b) with a rod of 35 mm dia., (c) with a rod of 19 mm dia. and \n(d) with a rod of 9 mm dia.

Even the more conductive \naluminum rod can be resolved as in Fig. 6(d).\nFig. 7 Reconstruction of copper tube with a copper rod at different Z \nlevels when the rod is placed in the centre. All dimensions in X and Y\ndirections are in m \nThe edge FEM forward solver was also applied using the\nimage reconstruction method as given in equation (5) to the\ntest case of a copper tube with a copper rod of 19 mm in\ndiameter. Fig. 7 shows the reconstructions of this test at\ndifferent Z levels that are produced by this 3D inverse finite\nelement method [7]. This shows a better preservation of the\n302\ntube shape than the single-step Tikhonov regularization. In\nthis study we choose the regularization parameter using ad\nhoc methods and the regularization parameter \u012e in equation\n(5) was chosen 10-5.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS \nThis study has shown the potential of EMT for imaging\ncoaxial annular objects. In particular, annulus object imaging\nis affected by a number of factors such as the relative size of\nthe internal object, the compositions of external\/internal\nobjects, relative positions and excitation frequency being\nused. Example images have been presented, which show that\nunder favorable conditions it is possible to image internal \nstructure using just an 8-coil array, operating at a single\nexcitation frequency. Further work is needed to advance the\nimage reconstruction algorithms and exploit multiple\nfrequency measurement techniques.\nFig. 8 shows the reconstructions at different Z levels when \nthe internal rod is placed off the centre, e.g., a position at (5 \nmm, -5 mm). This position has a higher sensitivity than the\ncentre and consequentially the quality of images shown in\nFig. 8 is better than that in Fig. 7.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors would like to thank UK Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for their\nfinancial support of the project.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
