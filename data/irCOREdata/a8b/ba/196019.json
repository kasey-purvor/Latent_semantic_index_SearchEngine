Previous studies of the aspect sensitivity of heater-\nenhanced incoherent radar backscatter in the high-latitude\nionosphere have demonstrated the directional dependence\nof incoherent scatter signatures corresponding to artificially\nexcited electrostatic waves, together with consistent field-\naligned signatures that may be related to the presence of arti-\nficial field-aligned irregularities.

Ionosphere (Active experiments; Plasma waves\nand instabilities; Polar ionosphere)\n1 Introduction\nAmong the most important phenomena associated with over-\ndense RF heating are the stimulation of non-propagating\nplasma density irregularities at the upper-hybrid height and\nCorrespondence to: R. S. Dhillon\n(ranvir.dhillon@ion.le.ac.uk)\nthe excitation of Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves at the O-\nmode reflection height (e.g. Robinson, 1989; Rietveld et al.,\n1993; Kohl et al., 1993; Mishin et al., 2004). These ion-\nacoustic and Langmuir waves can be detected in the interac-\ntion region by radars pointing in a wide range of directions,\nincluding those close to the geomagnetic field direction (e.g.\nStubbe et al., 1992; Kohl et al., 1993; Stubbe, 1996; Honary\net al., 1999; Rietveld et al., 2000; Dhillon and Robinson,\n2005). These wave modes give rise to enhancements in ion\nand plasma line incoherent scatter spectra and are thought\nto be caused by excitation of instabilities (Perkins and Kaw,\n1971) that include the purely growing mode (PGM) (Fejer\nand Leer, 1972), also called the oscillating two-stream insta-\nbility or modulational instability (Rietveld et al., 2002), and\nthe parametric decay instability (PDI) (Fejer, 1979). These\ntwo instabilities are thought to be driven by the effects of the\nponderomotive force (e.g. Kohl et al., 1993), thereby result-\ning in RF-induced Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves (PDI),\nand Langmuir waves associated with a stationary electron\ndensity perturbation (PGM). The PDI and PGM were first\nobserved using the HF heating facility at Arecibo (Carlson\net al., 1972; Gordon and Carlson, 1974) as summarized in\nthe review by Carlson and Duncan (1977). As well as F-\nregion spectral enhancements, RF-induced features have also\nbeen noted in E-region data, including those from sporadic E-\nlayers (e.g. Gordon and Carlson, 1976; Djuth, 1984; Schlegel\net al., 1987; Djuth and Gonzales, 1988; Rietveld et al., 2002;\nDhillon et al., 2007).\nThe SPEAR system (a relatively recent addition to the\nglobal array of HF high-power facilities) began experimen-\ntal operations in April 2004, since when a wide variety of\nRF-induced effects produced using the high-power beam\nhave been detected. These include SPEAR-induced plasma\nwave excitation and enhancements in field-parallel and field-\nperpendicular scatter (Robinson et al., 2006; Scoffield et\nal., 2006; Yeoman et al., 2007, 2008; Dhillon et al., 2007;\nClausen et al., 2008).

Dhillon et al.: Aspect sensitivity of SPEAR-enhanced incoherent backscatter\nmodifications whose characteristics are consistent with PGM\nand PDI excitation, together with other plasma physical phe-\nnomena such as the effects of cavitons (Djuth and Gonza-\nles, 1988), have been observed by the EISCAT Svalbard\nUHF incoherent scatter radar system (Robinson et al., 2006;\nDhillon et al., 2007). In this paper, we add to these results\nby concentrating mainly upon RF-induced spectral enhance-\nments and restrict our attention to E- and F-region SPEAR-\nenhanced spectral data accumulated by the EISCAT Svalbard\nRadar (ESR) during experimental SPEAR\/ESR\/CUTLASS\ncampaigns conducted in December 2005, October 2006 and\nAugust 2007.\nIt is clear that the response of the magnetized ionospheric\nplasma to a high-power pump wave exhibits great complex-\nity and variability depending upon the particular direction,\nrelative to the geomagnetic field, in which the observations\nof RF-induced phenomena are made. This dependence, or\n\u201caspect sensitivity\u201d, motivates us to investigate the underly-\ning plasma physical phenomena that give rise to such direc-\ntional variability. As noted by Robinson et al. (2006), inco-\nherent radar backscatter data display less aspect sensitivity\nthan data collected using coherent backscatter radars, which\nrely on orthogonal backscatter from field-aligned irregulari-\nties and therefore provide backscatter powers that maximize\nin directions perpendicular to the geomagnetic field. Previ-\nous studies involving the aspect sensitivity of RF-induced\nionospheric responses have included those in which signif-\nicant electron temperature enhancements have been noted\n(e.g. Rietveld et al., 2003), incoherent scatter radar obser-\nvations of ion and plasma line enhancements, together with\ntheir altitude characteristics (e.g. Djuth et al., 1994; Isham et\nal., 1999; Dhillon and Robinson, 2005), measurements of ar-\ntificial airglow (e.g. Kosch et al., 2000; Pedersen et al., 2003;\nKosch et al., 2004) and observations of stimulated electro-\nmagnetic emissions (Isham et al., 2005). These previous in-\nvestigations highlighted the importance of many directions\nrelative to the geomagnetic field and the study presented here\nagain provides evidence of the apparent special nature of cer-\ntain directions, including field-aligned.\nThe experimental configuration and certain technical as-\npects of the SPEAR and ESR systems are described in Sect. 2\nof this paper, with Sect. 3 providing an overview of the ex-\nperiments conducted in the SPEAR campaigns. A discussion\nof the results is presented in Sect. 4 and a summary of con-\nclusions is given in Sect. 5.\n2 Instrumentation\nSPEAR is a relatively new combined HF high-power (heater)\nand coherent scatter radar system, first described by Wright\net al. (2000), located in the vicinity of Longyearbyen\n(Spitzbergen in the Svalbard archipelago with a magnetic\ndip angle of approximately 8.5\u25e6) and is designed to carry\nout a range of space plasma investigations of the polar iono-\nsphere and magnetosphere. A comprehensive description\nof the SPEAR system, including scientific goals, capabili-\nties and initial results, together with technical specifications\nand operating constraints, has been presented by Robinson et\nal. (2006). During the intervals covered here, SPEAR oper-\nated using the full 6\u00d74 array, transmitting O-mode-polarized\nradio waves in the field-aligned direction with a frequency of\n4.45 MHz and an effective radiated power (ERP) of approxi-\nmately 15 MW. The half-power beam width is approximately\n21\u25e6.\nThe CUTLASS coherent scatter radars (Milan et al., 1997)\nwere also in operation during the experimental intervals pre-\nsented below. Both the Iceland and Finland radars ran an ex-\nperimental mode that used 15 km range gates on channel A\nand 45 km range gates on channel B, with beam 6 of Iceland\nand beam 9 of Finland overlooking the SPEAR site. Because\nof a combination of the frequency sweeps (11\u201313 MHz), in-\ntegration time (1 s) and beam sweeps (beams 3\u20135) that were\nused, the temporal resolution of the data from any specific\nrange-beam cell varied from 9\u201315 s. Further details of the\nCUTLASS operating modes utilized during the experiments\nare given by Robinson et al. (2006).\nThe incoherent scatter radar data presented below were\nrecorded using the ESR (Wannberg et al., 1997), which is\ncollocated with SPEAR. The ESR, which operates at fre-\nquencies close to 500 MHz, was used to detect the Lang-\nmuir and ion-acoustic waves generated during the excitation\nof instabilities near the O-mode reflection height. During all\nthree campaigns from which data are presented, i.e. those\nconducted during December 2005, October 2006 and August\n2007, the ESR ran an experimental mode that used the steer-\nable 32 m dish, whose pointing direction will be discussed\nin more detail below, to collect both ion and plasma line\ndata using long pulses. The ion line spectra were obtained\non two channels, with transmitter frequencies of 499.9 and\n500.3 MHz, using 350\u00b5s long pulses with a sampling rate\nof 10\u00b5s. The height-discriminated ion line spectral data\nfor both channels were obtained for an altitude range of 86\u2013\n481 km with a resolution of about 28 km. The frequency res-\nolutions of data from the two channels were 2.0 kHz with the\nfrequency ranges of both being \u00b150 kHz. Only data from\nthe 499.9 MHz channel have been presented in this paper.\nThe plasma line data were recorded on a separate channel,\nwith a transmitter frequency of 500.1 MHz and a resolution\nof 13.0 kHz, using a 1500\u00b5s long pulse with a sampling\nrate of 0.6\u00b5s. During the first two data intervals covered\nin this paper, plasma line spectra were obtained in two over-\nlapping frequency bands of 3.2\u20134.8 and 4.5\u20136.1 MHz both\nupshifted and downshifted from the transmitter frequency.\nFor the third interval, frequency bands upshifted and down-\nshifted by 3.65\u20135.25 MHz (centred on the SPEAR frequency\nof 4.45 MHz) and 4.5\u20136.1 MHz were used. The plasma line\ndata were obtained from altitude ranges of 90\u2013315 and 240\u2013\n465 km, although only data from the 90\u2013315 km altitude\nrange are presented in this paper.

Ionograms taken at 18:10 and 18:46 UT on 7 December 2005 (interval 1). The ionogram from 18:46 UT has signatures consistent\nwith a porous sporadic E-layer that affects waves with frequencies from 2\u20136 MHz. There is also evidence of second-hop scatter over this\nfrequency range. These ionograms, together with those shown in Figs. 2 and 3, were recorded using the Svalbard ionosonde during dropouts\nwhen SPEAR was not transmitting. In these figures, the SPEAR frequency of 4.45 MHz is denoted using a vertical dashed line.\nused, together with a lack of data regarding the echo strength\nversus range across the long pulse, the plasma line data are\nnot discriminated in altitude. The temporal resolution of both\nthe ion and the plasma line data was 5.0 s.\nIn order to investigate the aspect sensitivity of SPEAR-\nenhanced ESR backscatter, the steerable 32 m diameter dish\nwas oriented in several directions in the magnetic meridian\nplane, i.e. its azimuth was fixed (with a geographic bear-\ning of 182.1\u25e6) while its elevation varied according to pre-\ndetermined cycles, all centred on field-aligned (FA, with a\ngeographic azimuth and elevation of 182.1\u25e6 and 81.6\u25e6 re-\nspectively). A seven-direction cycle, with a dwell-time of\ntwo minutes per direction, was applied during the December\n2005 and October 2006 campaigns. This cycle used a sep-\naration of 5\u25e6 between adjacent pointing directions, thereby\nresulting in an angular extent of 30\u25e6 centred on field-aligned.\nUsing the convention that angular displacements in the di-\nrection of increasing elevation angle, from field-aligned, will\nbe labelled as positive, and angular displacements in the\ndirection of decreasing elevation angle will be labelled as\nnegative, we have denoted these seven pointing directions\nas follows: FA+15, FA+10, FA+5, FA, FA\u22125, FA\u221210 and\nFA\u221215. A fifteen-direction cycle with a higher spatial res-\nolution of 2\u25e6 between adjacent pointing directions was used\nduring the August 2007 campaign. This resulted in an angu-\nlar extent of 28\u25e6 centred on field-aligned. Adopting the same\nconvention for labelling pointing directions gives directions\nfrom FA+14 to FA\u221214, via FA+12, FA+10. . . FA etc. Also,\na dwell-time of one minute per direction was used for this\nhigher-resolution cycle.\n3 E- and F-region SPEAR-enhanced incoherent scatter\ndata\nThis section covers aspect sensitive E- and F-region ESR\nobservations of SPEAR-enhanced ion and plasma line spec-\ntral data collected during campaigns conducted in December\n2005, October 2006 and August 2007. During all three of\nthe intervals discussed below SPEAR continuously transmit-\nted O-mode-polarized radiation, at 4.45 MHz, while point-\ning in the field-aligned direction. The three data intervals\ncovered here are 18:10\u201320:10 UT on 7 December 2005 (in-\nterval 1), 11:00\u201316:00 UT on 9 October 2006 (interval 2)\nand 14:10\u201316:00 UT on 15 August 2007 (interval 3). As\ndescribed in Sect. 2, a seven-direction ESR scanning cy-\ncle was adopted during intervals 1 and 2, whereas a fifteen-\ndirection cycle was applied during interval 3. The SPEAR-\nenhanced spectra from these intervals illustrate clearly the\neffects of an HF high-power pump wave in (a) an irregu-\nlar ionosphere with traces of a sporadic E-layer (interval 1),\n(b) an ionosphere with a temporally varying F-region with\nmany features (interval 2) and (c) an ionosphere with a fairly\nweak F-region (interval 3). These ionospheric conditions\nwere deduced using ionograms, recorded using the Svalbard\nionosonde (Robinson et al., 2006), which were taken dur-\ning each of these data intervals. Although SPEAR was os-\ntensibly transmitting continuously, there were periods dur-\ning which transmissions did not occur. These dropouts were\ncaused by a number of factors, including activation of the\nLongyearbyen airport interlock, which inhibits transmissions\nfrom SPEAR and the ESR during the presence of aircraft,\noperational and technical difficulties, and compulsory inter-\nruption of our observations in order to collect data in support\nof the International Polar Year (IPY), with such experiments\nrunning well into 2008.

Figure 2 shows a series of ionograms, from 11:10 to\n15:42 UT on 9 October 2006 (within interval 2), recorded be-\nfore, within and after the duration in which SPEAR was nom-\ninally transmitting. These ionograms show an ionosphere\nwith an F-region that evolves over time, gradually becom-\ning less structured and more disturbed over time. Figure 3\nshows another series of ionograms, in this case beginning at\n14:06 UT and proceeding to 16:02 UT on 15 August 2007\n(i.e. through interval 3). These ionograms are suggestive of\nan irregular ionosphere, which at least for a period during the\ninterval is underdense. There is also evidence of an E-layer\nthat interacts with radio waves having frequencies from about\n2 to 4 MHz, and possibly higher. The vertical dashed line be-\ntween 4 and 5 MHz in all of these ionograms corresponds\nto the SPEAR frequency of 4.45 MHz. Although the altitude\nresolution in the ionograms is 6 km, signatures with extended\naltitude ranges are sometimes seen and these may be caused\nby the oblique nature of some of the echoes detected by the\nionosonde receiver\/processing system.\nWe turn now to the ESR incoherent scatter radar data that\nwere collected during the three intervals. The altitudinal and\ndirectional dependence of the ion line spectra will be dis-\ncussed later, with the data shown in Figs. 7 to 10, but we\nnow consider overviews of the ESR ion and plasma line data.\nWe have shown data from intervals 1 and 3 but have chosen\nnot to illustrate those from interval 2, because showing the\nspectral amplitudes over the entire five-hour interval would\nobscure the multi-directional enhancements that we wish to\nhighlight. The overviews are illustrated using Figs. 4 and\n5, which contain panels that show time series of the central\nion line (CIL) and upshifted (UPL) and downshifted (DPL)\nplasma line amplitudes. The central ion line corresponds to\nthe central spectral minimum, which is at the ion line radar\nfrequency (499.9 MHz). We have not shown the amplitudes\nof the (F-region) upshifted and downshifted ion lines, which\ncorrespond to the ion-acoustic peaks, as SPEAR-induced\nenhancements in these spectral components have tended to\nAnn.

The ionogram from 18:46 UT\nshown in Fig. 1 was collected during activation of the airport\ninterlock. Panels (a) to (d) show F-region (150\u2013250 km) CIL,\nE-region (80\u2013110 km) CIL, UPL and DPL data respectively.\nThese altitude ranges were chosen for the E- and F-regions\nby virtue of the fact that the principal spectral enhancements\noccurred within them (see Figs. 7 to 10). Panel (e) shows\nthe angular displacement of the 32 m dish in the magnetic\nmeridian plane (azimuth fixed at 182.1\u25e6). Although this dis-\nplacement can have values that exceed 90\u25e6, it has been la-\nbelled as the elevation angle, to which it is identical for\nvalues from 0\u25e6 (horizontal) to 90\u25e6 (vertical). We shall ex-\namine the data by considering significant signatures in the\nplasma line and\/or ion line data and study the directional de-\npendence of the apparent SPEAR-induced responses. Such\nSPEAR-induced spectral enhancements are easier to iden-\ntify in the plasma line data, as significant increases in the\nUPL and DPL amplitudes (at\u00b14.45 MHz from the radar fre-\nquency) will most probably be caused by SPEAR-excited\ninstabilities. This provides us with a reliable method by\nwhich to distinguish between natural and artificial features\nand we have positioned the red bars in this figure so as to\nhighlight the plasma line enhancements. By inspection, we\nnotice clear multi-directional SPEAR-induced spectral en-\nhancements that occur during scanning cycles 2, 4 and 6,\nand we shall concentrate on these. Considering cycle 2 first,\nwe see notable plasma line enhancements, clear in panels (c)\nand (d), when the ESR pointed in FA+15, FA+10 and FA\u22125.\nThe E-region ion line enhancement in FA, seen in panel (b),\nis not accompanied by an increase in the plasma line ampli-\ntude and this absence may cast doubt upon whether this ion\nline amplitude increase is a SPEAR-induced effect.

We there-\nfore conclude that the bulk of the enhancements occur in the\nE-region.

Due to plasma line\nhardware problems, the only useful measurements collected\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 65\u201381, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/65\/2009\/\nR. S. Dhillon et al.: Aspect sensitivity of SPEAR-enhanced incoherent backscatter 71\nduring this interval were the ion line data. Because of the\nnatural variability in the plasma density of the polar cap iono-\nsphere over SPEAR, and hence in the associated ion line\nspectral amplitude (e.g. Robinson et al., 2006; Dhillon et\nal., 2007), unambiguously identifying SPEAR-induced fea-\ntures became more difficult and we attempted to discern such\neffects by inspection. We were aided by recognizing the\nconsistent (apparent over several cycles) ion line enhance-\nments in FA. Also, we note that these enhancements, which\noccurred mainly in the F-region and which were similar to\nSPEAR-induced F-region enhancements reported previously\nby Robinson et al. (2006) and Dhillon et al. (2007), were\nnot as obvious for pointing directions away from FA. Despite\nthe difficulty in distinguishing between natural and artificial\nsignatures, we were able to identify scanning cycles contain-\ning evidence of SPEAR-enhanced multi-directional enhance-\nments. These scanning cycles are discussed below and the\ncorresponding ion line spectra are shown in Figs. 8 and 9.\nFigure 5 shows ion and plasma line data from interval 3\n(15 August 2007, 14:10\u201316:00 UT). For this interval the\nhigh-resolution (2\u25e6 angular separation) scanning mode was\nutilized and six scanning cycles were applied. Also, the scan-\nning sequence was reversed in the second and fifth cycles, i.e.\ngoing from FA\u221214 to FA+14 instead of FA+14 to FA\u221214,\nwhich was the sequence used in the other cycles. The panel\nlayout in this figure is the same as that used in Fig. 4, with\npanels (a) to (d) showing F-region CIL, E-region CIL, UPL\nand DPL respectively. Panel (e) again shows the elevation\nangle (angular displacement) of the 32 m dish. Plasma line\nhardware problems were again present and these data were\nonly available for 14:10\u201315:00 UT. As for interval 1, we\nhave used these plasma line data to identify periods of multi-\ndirectional enhancement, which have been highlighted using\nred bars. From 15:10\u201316:00 UT, when plasma line data were\nabsent, we tried to identify SPEAR-induced ion line spectral\nenhancements by inspection. The loss of data from approx-\nimately 14:20\u201314:30 UT resulted from the airport interlock,\nwhereas that from 15:00\u201315:10 UT was caused by manda-\ntory suspension of our experiment in order to accommodate\ndata collection for the IPY experiment. Definite E-region\nion line amplitude increases were seen in FA for cycles 2, 4\nand 6. There are additional increases in FA+8 and FA+6, i.e.\nclose to vertical, in cycle 1. There are also definite E-region\nion and plasma line spectral enhancements at the end of cy-\ncle 2 and beginning of cycle 3 in FA+14. Cycle 3 also con-\ntains ion and plasma line enhancements in FA+4 and FA+6.\nIn cycle 4, E-region ion line amplitude increases are again\npresent for directions from FA+4 to FA+12. The higher ion\nline amplitudes after about 15:30 UT in cycle 5 for all direc-\ntions from FA\u221210 to FA may also be SPEAR-induced.

Because of the 11\/2-hop\npropagation path via which the CUTLASS rays travel to and\nfrom the ionosphere over the SPEAR facility (Yeoman et al.,\n2007, 2008) it is found that the calculated position of the scat-\nter is highly susceptible to changes in the ionospheric plasma\ndensity. This results in apparent migration of the patch of ar-\ntificial backscatter over time.

Ion line spectra for scanning cycles 2, 4 and 6 from interval 1. For these data, and those from interval 2 shown in Figs. 8 and 9,\neach of the seven panels in each row shows temporally averaged ion line spectra from all times during which the ESR pointed in a specific\ndirection, which ranged from FA+15 to FA\u221215. Each panel direction is labelled using its designation, e.g. FA+10, followed by the azimuth\nand elevation of that pointing direction. The horizontal axis in each data panel shows the frequency and the other two axes show the altitude\nand the spectral amplitude. It is clear that significant E-region enhancements occur in FA+15, FA+5, FA and FA\u22125, with notable increases\nin FA. Also, the central parts of the F-region spectra in FA+15, FA+10 and FA+5 are clearly enhanced.\nwith the highest amplitude at a given time corresponds to the\nmost intense part of the SPEAR beam, which in this case\nwas pointing in the field-aligned direction. Since the loca-\ntion of SPEAR is known (78.15\u25e6 N, 16.05\u25e6 E geographic),\nthis technique may be used to reposition the scatter such that\nits apparent movement over time can be eliminated. A fur-\nther essential requirement involves confirming that the ma-\nnipulated scatter was genuinely SPEAR-induced, and not\nnaturally occurring scatter that happened to be in the vicin-\nity. This was done by examining the spectral widths of the\nbackscatter. Since artificial backscatter generally has lower\nspectral widths than those of natural backscatter (e.g. Dhillon\net al., 2002), this spectral characteristic may be used to\ndifferentiate SPEAR-enhanced CUTLASS backscatter from\nnatural backscatter. By applying this method to the data\nfrom this interval, we were able to identify the artificial\nbackscatter with some confidence. These corrective meth-\nods have been applied to CUTLASS data taken during in-\nterval 2 and a range-time-intensity plot of the repositioned\nartificial backscatter, for 11:00\u201316:00 UT, is shown in Fig. 6.\nThe upper and lower panels of this figure correspond to data\nfrom Finland Channel A (beam 9) and Iceland Channel A\n(beam 6) respectively. The labelled horizontal black bars\nin each panel show the overlaid geographic latitudes of the\nseven ESR pointing directions. These were calculated for\na typical interaction altitude during the interval of 180 km.\nThe variation in the backscatter amplitude across the modi-\nfied patch, as seen by both radars, results from the highest\nbackscatter power corresponding to the centre of the SPEAR\nbeam. The temporal variability in the width of the backscat-\nter patch may result, at least in part, from the intrinsic na-\nture of the polar cap ionosphere, through which patches of\noverdense plasma frequently travel (Robinson et al., 2006;\nDhillon et al., 2007). The variability in the backscatter am-\nplitude, at any spatial position, may also be explained by in-\ncluding the effects of changing ionospheric propagation. It is\nAnn.

Ion line spectra from scanning cycles 1, 4 and 5 from interval 2. The data are displayed using the same format and labelling as that\napplied in Fig. 7. The main features here are the probable SPEAR-induced F-region enhancements in FA+15, FA+10, FA and FA\u22125, with\nthe highest amplitude occurring in FA. These data are generally characterized by increases in the amplitudes of the ion-acoustic peaks and\nof the central part of the spectrum. There is evidence of an E-region throughout the three cycles, but this appears to be unaffected by the\nSPEAR high-power wave.\nnotable that the powers have fallen appreciably for pointing\ndirections furthest from FA, i.e. FA\u00b110 and FA\u00b115. This\nvariation in the backscatter amplitudes implies that the ef-\nfects of field-aligned irregularities on ESR incoherent scat-\nter data will most likely be seen in data from FA, with\nthe influence of these irregularities decreasing with increas-\ning aspect angle. This in turn is consistent with the aspect\nsensitivity mechanism proposed by Dhillon and Robinson\n(2005), whereby the field-aligned irregularities may interact\nwith SPEAR-excited electrostatic waves. We shall return to\nthese results later in the discussion given in Sect. 4.\nPreviously we discussed overviews of ion and plasma line\ndata from intervals 1, 2 and 3. We shall now examine the\ndirectional and altitudinal dependence of the ion line spec-\ntra from the three data intervals. Starting with interval 1, we\nnote that data taken during scanning cycles 2, 4 and 6 exhib-\nited significant multi-directional spectral enhancements. The\ncorresponding ion line spectra are shown in Fig. 7, which has\nthree rows of panels that show the data from cycles 2, 4 and\n6, respectively. Each of the seven panels in each row shows\ntemporally averaged ion line spectra from all times during\nwhich the ESR pointed in a specific direction in that cycle\nand each pointing direction, from FA+15 to FA\u221215, is la-\nbelled using its designation, e.g. FA+10, followed by the az-\nimuth and elevation of that pointing direction. The horizontal\naxis in each data panel shows the frequency and the other two\naxes show the altitude and the spectral amplitude. Taking cy-\ncle 2 first, it is clear that significant E-region enhancements\noccur in FA and FA\u22125, with the highest amplitude occurring\nin FA. The central parts of the F-region spectra in FA+15,\nFA+10 and FA+5 are clearly enhanced, indicating the ac-\ntion of SPEAR (Robinson et al., 2006; Dhillon et al., 2007).\nThe data from cycle 4 have similar strong E-region enhance-\nments in FA, although in this case they are accompanied by\nF-region signatures that are present in spectra from all direc-\ntions. These E-region characteristics are repeated in the data\nfrom cycle 6, with noticeable enhancements in FA+15, FA+5\nand FA, although F-region signatures are not apparent.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/65\/2009\/ Ann.

Ion line spectra from scanning cycles 7, 11 and 14 from interval 2. The data are displayed using the same format and labelling as that\napplied in Fig. 7. These data contain fewer examples of F-region enhancements, although they appear to show enhancements in the E-region\nfrom FA+10, FA+5, FA and FA\u22125.\nThe single central peaks present in these E-region spectra\nare indicative of collisional plasma and the increase in ampli-\ntude of these peaks during SPEAR-on is consistent with pre-\nvious observations of RF-enhanced E-region ion line spectra\n(e.g. Rietveld et al., 2002; Dhillon et al., 2007). In the F-\nregion, SPEAR-induced spectral enhancements were found\nto occur within the altitude range of 150\u2013250 km. The F-\nregion ion line spectrum has its usual form, with two ion-\nacoustic peaks whose separation is related to the plasma tem-\nperature. This ion-acoustic peak separation remained un-\nchanged while SPEAR transmitted, which implies that there\nwas a negligible change in the electron temperature dur-\ning SPEAR-on. The symmetric nature of the spectra pre-\nsented here is in agreement with the high degree of sym-\nmetry seen in previous SPEAR-enhanced F-region ion line\nspectra (Robinson et al., 2006), which were obtained when\nno significant E-region was present. It also contrasts with\nthe asymmetric F-region spectral data, reported by Dhillon\net al. (2007), which were obtained during the presence of a\nsporadic E-layer.\nWe turn now to interval 2, where, of the sixteen scanning\ncycles that were used, cycles 1, 4, 5, 7, 11 and 14 contained\npossible multi-directional SPEAR-induced ion line enhance-\nments. As we have noted above, the modified spectra, par-\nticularly in the F-region, are similar in form to previous\nSPEAR-enhanced ion line spectra (Robinson et al., 2006;\nDhillon et al., 2007) and this similarity provides evidence\nthat the spectral modifications are caused by the action of\nSPEAR. The data are shown in Figs. 8 and 9 with Fig. 8\ncovering data from scanning cycles 1, 4 and 5, and Fig. 9\ndisplaying data from cycles 7, 11 and 14. These data are pre-\nsented in the same form as those in Fig. 7, with each row\nof panels corresponding to a particular scanning cycle and\nthe panels, from left to right, denoting the pointing direc-\ntions from FA+15 to FA\u221215. The three axes again show\nthe frequency, the altitude and the spectral amplitude. The\nmain features in Fig. 8 are the probable SPEAR-induced F-\nregion enhancements in FA+15, FA+10, FA and FA\u22125, with\nthe highest amplitude occurring in FA.

Ion line spectra from scanning cycle 3 from interval 3. Since the cycles shown here comprise fifteen pointing directions instead of\nseven, the panel layout has been amended appropriately. Therefore fifteen panels have been used, one for each of the pointing directions from\nFA+14 to FA\u221214 (left to right and downwards), with the axes in each data panel again showing the frequency, the altitude and the spectral\namplitude. As before, each panel direction is labelled using its designation, e.g. FA+10, followed by the azimuth and elevation of that\npointing direction. The main features in this data are the characteristic E-region amplitude increases. These occur in many directions, from\nFA+14 to FA\u22126, with a notable prevalence of high-amplitude scatter being present around vertical. Although F-region spectral signatures\nare present, there is little evidence for SPEAR-induced amplitude increases in these F-region spectra.\nThere is evidence of an E-region throughout the three cycles,\nbut this appears to be unaffected by the SPEAR high-power\nwave. The data in Fig. 9 contain fewer examples of F-region\nenhancements, although they do appear to show definite en-\nhancements in the E-region, with these increases occurring\nin FA+10, FA+5, FA and FA\u22125.\nWe conclude our presentation of the data by considering\nthe ion line spectra from interval 3. Although we previously\nhighlighted scanning cycles 1, 3, 4 and 5 (Fig. 5), only ion\nline spectra from scanning cycle 3 have been presented. This\nis because enhanced plasma lines were seen during this cy-\ncle, which is consistent with these features being SPEAR-\ninduced. Additionally, cycle 3 contains the clearest exam-\nples of similar signatures that are also present in cycles 4\nand 5. Furthermore, we have neglected to comment further\non data from cycle 1 because of the dropout caused by the\nairport interlock. The data are shown in Fig. 10 and since cy-\ncle 3 comprises fifteen pointing directions instead of seven,\nthe panel layout has been changed accordingly. Figure 10\nconsists of fifteen panels, one for each of the pointing direc-\ntions from FA+14 to FA\u221214 (left to right and downwards),\nwith the panel axes corresponding to the same parameters as\nbefore. The main features are clearly the characteristic E-\nregion amplitude increases that occur for a number of direc-\ntions. These occur in many directions, from FA+14 to FA\u22126,\nwith a prevalence of high-amplitude scatter being present\naround vertical. Although F-region spectral signatures are\npresent, there is little evidence for SPEAR-induced ampli-\ntude increases in these F-region spectra.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/65\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 65\u201381, 2009\n76 R. S. Dhillon et al.: Aspect sensitivity of SPEAR-enhanced incoherent backscatter\n4 Discussion\nIn this study, we have provided ESR observations of the tem-\nporal evolution of aspect sensitive SPEAR-induced E- and\nF-region ion and plasma line spectral enhancements from the\npolar ionosphere over Svalbard. We have presented evidence\nof multi-directional spectral enhancements during three in-\ntervals when the SPEAR high-power facility was transmit-\nting continuously in O-mode at 4.45 MHz while pointing\nfield-aligned. We note the presence of SPEAR-enhanced in-\ncoherent backscatter from a variety of directions throughout\nthe angular range (\u00b115\u25e6 centred on field-aligned) over which\nwe have obtained our observations. These results illustrate\nclearly the dependence of RF-induced phenomena on their\ndirection relative to the geomagnetic field. Where possible,\nion line data were complemented by plasma line data, as\nupshifted and downshifted plasma line enhancements at the\nSPEAR pump frequency (\u00b14.45 MHz from the ESR trans-\nmitter frequency) were likely to be SPEAR-induced. On the\nother hand, (E-region 0 kHz) ion line enhancements can re-\nsult from natural plasma density increases and such variabil-\nity in the plasma density is indicative of the SPEAR-affected\nregion of ionosphere being traversed by patches of overdense\nplasma (Robinson et al., 2006; Dhillon et al., 2007).\nIon line data from interval 1 (7 December 2005) in-\nclude E-region amplitude enhancements in the central ion\nline and F-region amplitude enhancements in both the ion-\nacoustic peaks and the central part of the ion line spec-\ntrum. SPEAR-enhanced plasma lines were also observed.\nFor the porous sporadic E-layer in this interval, clear from\nFig. 1, the E-region enhancements indicate that the transmit-\nted pump wave energy excited electrostatic waves in the E-\nregion. This is consistent with patchy E-region plasma that is\nin frequent motion during SPEAR-on (Dhillon et al., 2007).\nIt is also indicative of highly variable density-dependent ab-\nsorption within and penetration through the sporadic E-layer\nduring the SPEAR-on period. As mentioned by Robinson et\nal. (2006), the variability in the plasma density leads to strong\nlocal fluctuations in the electric field strength of the high-\npower wave. Therefore, the threshold electric fields neces-\nsary for instability excitation will only be exceeded intermit-\ntently and for short periods during the SPEAR-on interval.\nIf the plasma density of the sporadic E-layer is high, then\nthis implies that the majority of the high-power wave energy\nought to be absorbed or reflected in the E-region, with lit-\ntle to propagate to the F-region. However, any RF energy\nthat does manage to penetrate the patchy sporadic E-layer\nis free to propagate to the F-region, where, for sufficiently\nhigh F-region plasma density, it can excite the instabilities\nthat enhance the F-region spectra. Previous SPEAR-induced\nspectral enhancements during the presence of a sporadic E-\nlayer (Dhillon et al., 2007) have been attributed to the effects\nof cavitons (Djuth and Gonzales, 1988) and the observations\ndiscussed here may also be caused by the same physical pro-\ncess, further details of which are given below.\nAs for the data from interval 1, the E-region ion line spec-\ntra from interval 3 (15 August 2007) have a single central\npeak, indicating collisional plasma, rather than a pair of ion-\nacoustic peaks and RF-induced phenomena caused an in-\ncrease in the amplitude of this central peak. However, the\nionograms from this interval (Fig. 3) do not indicate the pres-\nence of a sporadic E-layer during the SPEAR-on period. We\ntherefore propose that these observations may be explained\nby invoking the PDI or the PGM (see below), which may\nalso account for the E-region results reported by Rietveld et\nal. (2002). Although there is a degree of variability in the ion\nand plasma line data, there is some evidence to suggest that\nthese ion line enhancements were accompanied by plasma\nline enhancements for pointing directions close to vertical.\nThis is consistent with previous SPEAR-induced ion and\nplasma line enhancements, which have also tended to occur\nsimultaneously (Robinson et al., 2006; Dhillon et al., 2007).\nAs for the E-region data from interval 3, F-region ion line\nenhancements from interval 2 (9 October 2006), which oc-\ncur in the central part of the ion line spectrum and in the ion-\nacoustic peaks, also suggest that both the PDI and the PGM\nwere operating, with F-region ionogram features (Fig. 2) in-\ndicating that the high-power wave interacted in the F-region.\nOur results were obtained while SPEAR operated with\nan ERP of approximately 15 MW and are consistent with\na negligible SPEAR-induced change in the plasma temper-\nature. As suggested by Robinson et al. (2006), this rela-\ntively low SPEAR pump power may result in limited heating\nof the plasma when compared to the temperature enhance-\nments that are routinely seen using the EISCAT (Troms\u00f8)\nheater, which has an ERP of several hundred MW (Rietveld\net al., 1993). Also, this negligible plasma heating implies a\nlack of interaction altitude descent driven by RF-induced re-\nductions in the recombination rate. Such descent has been\nnoted by Djuth et al. (1994) for vertical observations and\nthose obtained from 5\u25e6 south of vertical, and by Dhillon\nand Robinson (2005) for field-aligned observations. This\ntemperature-dependent effect has since been modelled by\nAshrafi et al. (2006) whose results agreed with the findings\nof Djuth et al. (1994) and Dhillon and Robinson (2005), both\nof whose studies were undertaken using the EISCAT heater\nand mainland incoherent scatter radar system.\nTurning now to the CUTLASS coherent backscatter data\n(Fig. 6) from interval 2 (9 October 2006), we see prominent\nSPEAR-induced backscatter enhancements observed by both\nthe CUTLASS Finland (beam 9) and Iceland (beam 6) radars.\nSPEAR-enhanced CUTLASS backscatter, consistent with\nartificial field-aligned irregularities, and SPEAR-enhanced\nESR backscatter have previously been observed simultane-\nously (Robinson et al., 2006; Dhillon et al., 2007). As noted\nby Robinson et al. (2006), such observations are in marked\ncontrast to those typically obtained at Troms\u00f8, where irreg-\nularity onset, associated with upper-hybrid waves excited at\nthe upper-hybrid resonance layer, is usually assumed to in-\nhibit excitation of Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves, which\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 65\u201381, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/65\/2009\/\nR. S. Dhillon et al.: Aspect sensitivity of SPEAR-enhanced incoherent backscatter 77\noccur near the O-mode reflection height, by redirecting the\npump wave energy towards stimulating these upper-hybrid\nwaves. Such simultaneous observations of coherent and in-\ncoherent backscatter indicate important differences between\nRF-induced effects in the ionospheres over Troms\u00f8 and Sval-\nbard, and further investigations involving comparison of the\nbackscatter amplitudes may yield important information re-\ngarding RF-induced instability processes in the polar iono-\nsphere. We report similar simultaneous enhancements in\nthis study, where, particularly between 12:00 and 15:00 UT\n(scanning cycles 4 to 14 in interval 2), variable ion line\namplitudes are present together with artificial backscatter\n(Fig. 6). Combining these observations with the well ac-\ncepted result that irregularities are generated at the upper-\nhybrid height, which is close to where the O-mode pump\nwave is reflected, the ESR observations indicate that the ar-\ntificial irregularities detected by CUTLASS were generated\nin the F-region, from where previous observations have been\nmade and from where ray-tracing studies indicate that such\nscatter should originate (Robinson et al., 2006; Yeoman et\nal., 2007, 2008). These findings complement the study by\nDhillon et al. (2007) who observed irregularities from upper\nE-\/lower F-region altitudes. Further evidence that the scatter\noriginated from the upper E-\/lower F-region, and not from\nhigher altitudes, was provided by Senior et al. (2004) who,\nfollowing on from previous studies undertaken by Jones et\nal. (1984) and Robinson (1989), investigated the altitudinal\nextent of RF-induced artificial field-aligned irregularities and\ndetermined that they had e-folding scale lengths of approxi-\nmately 20 km.\nAs noted above, the observation of SPEAR-enhanced\nCUTLASS backscatter is highly susceptible to changes in\nthe ionospheric plasma density, which affects the charac-\nteristics of the 11\/2-hop propagation path that is required to\nobserve the scatter (Yeoman et al., 2007, 2008). Also, the\nvariability in ionospheric conditions over extended periods\naffects the ability of the ionosphere to sustain artificial ir-\nregularities, e.g. if the plasma becomes underdense then ar-\ntificial field-aligned irregularities will not be created. These\nfactors combined would result in variable backscatter pow-\ners being measured by CUTLASS. Dhillon and Robinson\n(2005) proposed a relationship between field-aligned irreg-\nularities and routinely observed field-aligned RF-enhanced\nincoherent scatter, whereby artificially excited ion-acoustic\nand Langmuir waves could be guided preferentially along the\ngeomagnetic field. This process may rely upon the irregulari-\nties, which are elongated and extend along the field lines, act-\ning as waveguides and focusing along the geomagnetic field\nthose waves whose wave vectors are generally parallel to\nit, thereby channelling RF-excited electrostatic waves in the\nfield-aligned direction. This mechanism is consistent with\nour F-region ESR observations, where field-aligned SPEAR-\nexcited electrostatic waves were often observed. In addition,\nwe have also seen repeated E-region field-aligned amplitude\nincreases.\nWe now discuss the reported aspect sensitivity of vari-\nous RF-induced features. Such aspect sensitive responses\ninclude those that have been observed in Langmuir turbu-\nlence (Isham et al., 1999), RF-induced descent of the inter-\naction altitude (Djuth et al., 1994; Dhillon and Robinson,\n2005), optical emissions (Kosch et al., 2000; Pedersen et\nal., 2003; Kosch et al., 2004), electron temperature increases\n(Rietveld et al., 2003) and stimulated electromagnetic emis-\nsions (SEE) (Isham et al., 2005). The field-aligned direc-\ntion was found to be important in some of these studies,\ne.g. Rietveld et al. (2003) found the highest electron tem-\nperature increases in this direction. This agreed with the\nfindings of Dhillon and Robinson (2005) whose observations\nof field-aligned RF-induced descent of the interaction alti-\ntude were explained using these high electron temperatures.\nAlso, observations of artificially induced optical emissions\n(airglow) were also noted to occur preferentially in the field-\naligned direction (Kosch et al., 2000; Pedersen et al., 2003).\nHowever, other directions to the geomagnetic field have also\ngiven interesting results. For instance, RF-induced descent\nof the interaction altitude was noted by Djuth et al. (1994)\nin the vertical direction and from 5\u25e6 south of vertical. Also,\nIsham et al. (1999) found that RF-induced Langmuir turbu-\nlence maximized between field-aligned and the direction cor-\nresponding to the Spitze angle, which demarcates the Spitze\nregion through which propagating high-power waves may\nreach their highest possible reflection point and excite insta-\nbilities that include the PDI and PGM. In addition, Dhillon\nand Robinson (2005) found persistent heater-enhanced in-\ncoherent backscatter from 6\u25e6 south of field-aligned. Such\nmulti-directional backscatter was also recorded by Kosch et\nal. (2004), together with optical emissions, and the directions\nfrom which these heater-induced phenomena originated were\nfound to vary over time. Furthermore, Isham et al. (2005) ob-\ntained evidence for the aspect sensitivity of different features\npresent in SEE spectra.\nPrevious studies in which aspect sensitive phenomena\nhave been reported have noted the importance of the Spitze\nregion (e.g. Isham et al., 1999; Kosch et al., 2000), in which\nthe angle of the pump waves to the vertical is less than the\nSpitze angle. Such high-power rays can reach the altitude\nwhere the pump frequency equals the local cold plasma fre-\nquency, thereby propagating through the PDI and PGM ex-\ncitation region, which extends from the O-mode reflection\nheight down to where Landau damping of the electrostatic\nwaves becomes prohibitively large (Rietveld et al., 1993;\nKohl et al., 1993). Importantly, Mishin et al. (2004, 2005)\nargued that heating outside the Spitze region, including in the\nfield-aligned direction, was not conducive to the generation\nof Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves via the actions of the\nPDI and PGM. Consequently, Mishin et al. (2004, 2005) pro-\nposed an alternative mechanism for excitation of Langmuir\nand ion-acoustic waves outside the Spitze region. This pro-\ncess involved parametric decay of the O-mode pump wave\ninto upper-hybrid (and lower-hybrid) waves. Together, these\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/65\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 65\u201381, 2009\n78 R. S. Dhillon et al.: Aspect sensitivity of SPEAR-enhanced incoherent backscatter\nprovide us with two mechanisms that could result in SPEAR-\nenhanced incoherent backscatter, depending upon whether\nthe Spitze angle is exceeded by the propagating high-power\nwaves.\nWe turn now to our observations and note that the Spitze\nangle at Svalbard is about 4\u25e6. From this we determine\nthat, for data intervals 1 and 2, FA+5 and FA+10 lie within\nthe Spitze region with FA+15 being just outside. Simi-\nlarly for interval 3, FA+12, FA+10, FA+8 and FA+6 are\nwithin the Spitze region, with FA+14, FA+4 and FA+2 being\njust outside. Taking into account previously recorded field-\naligned enhancements (e.g. Dhillon and Robinson, 2005),\nand those occurring between field-aligned and the Spitze\nangle (Isham et al., 1999), we may consider FA, FA+2,\nFA+4 and the Spitze region directions given above as an-\ntenna orientations with which we may reasonably expect\nto see SPEAR-enhanced scatter. Although our observa-\ntions indicate spectral enhancements from many directions,\nwe note that SPEAR-enhanced incoherent backscatter was\nseen frequently in FA and in directions close to verti-\ncal. Field-aligned SPEAR-induced enhancements similar to\nthose shown here have been observed previously (Robinson\net al., 2006; Dhillon et al., 2007) and have been attributed\nto the actions of the PDI and PGM, although this appears to\nbe inconsistent with the conditions described by Mishin et\nal. (2004, 2005). However, the results from close to ver-\ntical, recorded using pointing directions within the Spitze\nregion, may be explained by invoking the PDI and PGM.\nAlso, enhancements in FA+15 and FA+14 are very close to\nthe edge of the Spitze region and may also be accounted for\nusing the PDI and PGM. Perhaps more puzzling are the sig-\nnatures from directions south of field-aligned. Such signa-\ntures were seen in FA\u221215 and repeatedly in FA\u22125. These\nobservations in FA\u22125 are similar to the Troms\u00f8 results ob-\ntained by Dhillon and Robinson (2005) where ion line am-\nplitude increases were seen from 6\u25e6 south of field-aligned.\nThey are also in accordance with the findings of Ogawa\nand Oyama (private communications, 2007) who noted RF-\nenhanced scatter from 6\u20138\u25e6 south of field-aligned at Troms\u00f8.\nAs a final remark on aspect sensitivity, we suggest that our\nobservations of enhanced scatter at FA\u221215 may indicate the\npresence of an ionospheric tilt, perhaps similar to that noted\nby Rietveld et al. (2003), with sufficient power being trans-\nmitted into the ionosphere due to the presence of a side lobe,\nas modelling of the beam pattern shows that the side lobes\nhave maxima that occur at about 15\u25e6 off the centre of the\nmain lobe.\nWe now discuss the effects of a high-power pump wave\ninteracting with the kind of sporadic E-layer that was present\nduring interval 1. Both Gordon and Carlson (1976) and\nDjuth (1984) observed sporadic E-layer plasma line enhance-\nments exactly at the radar frequency\u00b1the pump frequency.\nDjuth (1984) concluded that the PGM was probably below\nthreshold during these observations, and therefore direct con-\nversion may play a role in explaining the sporadic E-layer\ndata. Djuth and Gonzales (1988) subsequently examined the\ntemporal development of the RF-enhanced sporadic E-layer\nplasma line in great detail and concluded that, although di-\nrect conversion of the pump wave into Langmuir waves by\nin situ small-scale irregularities can explain rapid (less than\n20\u00b5s) RF-enhanced plasma line growth, slower (greater than\n100\u00b5s) observed growth times are difficult to explain with\nthis process. Instead, it was proposed that mode conver-\nsion along sporadic E-layer vertical gradients near the crit-\nical layer provides a better overall description of the obser-\nvations, and that the formation of density cavities (cavitons)\nnear the reflection height may play an essential role in the\nproduction of Langmuir waves. These cavitons (e.g. Morales\nand Lee, 1977) could give rise to the SPEAR-induced spo-\nradic E-layer ion and plasma line enhancements reported\nhere and similar ion line enhancements presented by Dhillon\net al. (2007). Such cavitons and the spatial extent of asso-\nciated density inhomogeneities are consistent with the study\nby Robinson (2002) who applied a multiple scatter theory\nto the propagation of electromagnetic test waves during RF-\ninduced heating and found a broadening of the interaction\nregion.\nFurthermore, observed plasma line growth times in the\nrange <4 to 20\u00b5s, being much shorter than those antici-\npated for a convective PDI, led Newman et al. (1998) to sug-\ngest that an absolute (i.e. non-convective) PDI (Rosenbluth\net al., 1973) could develop in the sporadic E-layer plasma.\nThe absolute instability in an inhomogeneous plasma, whose\nthreshold is much higher than that for the convective instabil-\nity (e.g. Goldman et al., 1997), is not limited by convective\nlosses, where the three-wave interaction matching condition\nthat characterizes the convective instability is essentially de-\ntuned as Langmuir waves propagate along the steep electron\ndensity gradient (e.g. Bernhardt et al., 2003). This was used\nto explain the large sporadic E-layer airglow enhancements\nobserved by Djuth et al. (1999) at altitudes of approximately\n120 km. Bernhardt et al. (2003) indicated that linear mode\nconversion may also be important in explaining the sporadic\nE-layer airglow. Also, Gondarenko et al. (2003) performed\nsimulations that indicate that linear mode conversion in spo-\nradic E-layer plasma above Arecibo gives rise to localized\nregions containing amplified electric fields. These enhanced\nelectric fields could accelerate electrons and lead to the pro-\nduction of the intense airglow.\nAs stated above, SPEAR-induced E-region enhancements\nfrom interval 3 were collected during a period when the cor-\nresponding ionograms indicated that a sporadic E-layer was\nnot present. This implies that, as for our F-region observa-\ntions, the PDI and PGM may have been excited, as these re-\nsults were probably obtained from a plasma regime similar to\nthat studied by Rietveld et al. (2002), who presented ion and\nplasma line observations in an auroral E-layer having a scale\nheight of 5\u201310 km. This is significantly different from spo-\nradic E-layer plasma, where the scale height is 0.2\u20131 km or\nless (Djuth, 1984). One expects the (convective) PDI and the\nAnn.

The reason for this\nis that in a steep sporadic E-layer electron density gradient,\nthe Langmuir wave vector quickly rotates away from the di-\nrection of the pump field thereby decoupling from the pump.\nIn addition, the wave rapidly propagates outside of the nar-\nrowly confined altitude region of instability preventing sig-\nnificant Langmuir wave amplification from occurring (e.g.\nPerkins and Flick, 1971; Fejer and Leer, 1972; Muldrew,\n1978). Consequently, the thresholds of the PGM and the\nstandard convective PDI become extremely large and there-\nfore the PDI and PGM do not represent viable processes with\nwhich to explain the production of Langmuir waves in spo-\nradic E-layers. This argument is supported by theoretical\nstudies of Langmuir turbulence in collisional E-region con-\nditions undertaken by Goldman et al. (1995, 1997).\n5 Conclusions\nWe have presented an aspect sensitivity study of SPEAR-\ninduced ESR spectral enhancements from the E- and F-\nregions of the polar ionosphere. As alluded to above, the\nionosphere over Svalbard is highly variable with patches of\noverdense plasma that drift in and out of the region of influ-\nence of SPEAR and field-of-view of the ESR. This indicates\nthat the thresholds for instability excitation are exceeded\nonly intermittently during SPEAR-on. This high level of\nionospheric variability therefore leads to inconsistent obser-\nvations of SPEAR-induced backscatter. Furthermore, such\nvariability affects the repeatability of the experiment, since\nthe ionosphere may have changed while cycling through the\nset of directions, so that notable enhancements in a particu-\nlar direction in one scanning cycle may not be present in that\ndirection during subsequent scanning cycles. Therefore, we\nhave applied several scanning cycles in order to test the as-\npect sensitive response of the ionosphere to the high-power\npump wave and to examine whether this response provides\nconsistent signatures in any pointing direction. We have ob-\nserved sporadic E-layer enhancements indicating the pres-\nence of cavitons and E- and F-region enhancements consis-\ntent with the actions of both the PGM and the PDI. We have\nnoted features from a variety of directions, some of which\nwere frequently observed in field-aligned, vertical and south\nof field-aligned. Reasons for the prevalence of observations\nfrom (close to) vertical include the existence of the Spitze\nregion. In addition, observations of enhanced field-aligned\nscatter may be aided by the presence of field-aligned irreg-\nularities, which may guide the electrostatic waves that are\nexcited by RF-induced instabilities. However, evidence ap-\npears to be growing that the ionospheric region correspond-\ning to pointing directions of about 5\u20138\u25e6 south of field aligned\nis worthy of further investigation, and our Svalbard observa-\ntions of RF-enhanced incoherent backscatter from 5\u25e6 south\nof field-aligned provide such contributory evidence. Collec-\ntively these findings indicate the significance of the direc-\ntional dependence of RF-induced phenomena and highlight\nthe importance of further investigating the aspect sensitiv-\nity of such effects. Finally, we should remark that these re-\nsults highlight the value of plasma physical experiments con-\nducted in the polar cap ionosphere using the SPEAR high-\npower facility, which satisfactorily complement previous ob-\nservations from lower latitudes.\nAcknowledgements.
