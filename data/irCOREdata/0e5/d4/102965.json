Archer\nSurrey Sleep Research Centre, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom\nThe 24-hour (h) light\u2013dark (LD) cycle is a fundamental\ncharacteristic of Earth\u2019s environment and so its powerful influence\non the behaviour and physiology of animals and humans that\nevolved on this planet is not surprising. In addition to influencing\nthe perception of visual images, light coordinates the temporal\nrhythms of physiology and behaviour by sending signals to\nstructures in the brain that contain the central circadian clock.\nThese signals are mediated in part by melanopsin, a photopigment\nfound in the retina. Light affects the brain through these nonvisual\npathways, and scientists have recently begun to realize just how\npervasive these nonvisual effects are. Mounting evidence supports\nthe view that the effects of light on sleep and brain activity during\nwakefulness, as well as the duration of sleep and the homeostatic\nresponse to sleep loss, depend on both melanopsin and circadian\ntime.\nLight and Entrainment of Circadian Rhythms\nIn humans and other diurnal animals, most behavioural activity\noccurs during the day, whereas in nocturnal animals, such as mice,\nmost activities are confined to the dark phase. Even in the absence\nof an LD cycle, the rest\u2013activity rhythm persists with a periodicity\nof approximately 24 h, instead of redistributing across the 24-h\nday. More than 35 years ago, it was discovered that circadian\nrhythms in mammals are driven by \u2018\u2018pacemakers\u2019\u2019 in the brain,\nwhich consist of thousands of neurons in structures called the\nsuprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus [1]\n(see Figure 1). The SCN are directly connected to the retina; when\nthis pathway is disrupted, the rest\u2013activity cycle fails to be\nsynchronized to the LD cycle. Normal synchronization, or\nentrainment, to different LD cycles is accomplished through\nvariation in the response of the circadian pacemaker to light pulses\n[2,3]. Light exposure late in the biological day, around dusk, will\ndelay the onset of activity in a nocturnal animal, and delay the\nonset of inactivity in a diurnal animal. Light exposure early in the\nbiological day (dawn) will advance the onset of activity in a diurnal\nspecies, and advance the onset of sleep in a nocturnal species. This\nphase-shifting effect of light is clearly a non-image forming effect of\nlight, which depends on circadian phase and plays an important\nrole in the temporal organization of behaviour in animals,\nincluding humans. We now know more details about the\nmolecular machinery that gives rise to this circadian clock and\nhow light exposure affects the expression of some of the\ncomponent clock genes, and we know that this expression depends\non the phase of the endogenous cycle at which light exposure\noccurs [4,5].\nLight and the Circadian and Homeostatic Aspect\nof Sleep Regulation\nSleep is regulated by an interaction of homeostatic and\ncircadian processes. The homeostatic mechanisms keep track of\nhow long we have been awake and asleep, and the circadian\nprocess determines the optimal time for sleep. The homeostatic\nand circadian processes also influence sleep duration and the\nrelative contribution of the two major types of sleep: non-rapid eye\nmovement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In\nother words, how sleepy we are and the structure of sleep depend\non how long we have been awake and the biological time of day.\nThe SCN generate signals that influence sleepiness, sleep duration,\nand sleep structure. As expected, lesions of the SCN abolish the\ncircadian aspect of sleep regulation. However, lesions of the SCN\ndo not abolish the homeostatic aspect of sleep regulation as\nindexed by the deepest form of NREM sleep, which is called slow-\nwave sleep because during this sleep stage the electrocorticogram\n(ECoG) is dominated by slow wave activity (SWA) [6]. There is\nnow a large body of evidence showing that circadian rhythmicity\nand homeostatic processes related to the sleep\u2013wake cycle\ncontribute to the regulation of many aspects of behaviour and\nbrain function, including our performance on cognitive tasks [7].\nA key question in the field concerns the effects of light on the\ncircadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep and waking\nperformance. Adequately timed light exposure that shifts the\ntiming of the rhythms driven by the SCN also shifts the timing of\nsleep and performance rhythms. However, the effects of light on\nsleep\u2013wake regulation extend beyond these phase-shifting effects.\nEarly on, it was demonstrated that in the nocturnal rat, light can\nacutely suppress activity and induce sleep [8], whereas in the\ndiurnal human, light exerts an acute alerting effect [9]. These\ndirect effects of light on sleep\u2013wake regulation did not receive\nmuch attention until the recent description of some of the\nunderlying pathways and mechanisms.\nLight Input Pathways: Melanopsin, Rods, and\nCones\nOriginally, scientists held a tacit belief that the light effects on\ncircadian rhythms, as well as other non-image forming effects,\nwere mediated by the classical photoreceptors that mediate vision.\nThis view was shattered when non-image forming responses were\ndemonstrated in mice devoid of the then known photoreceptors:\nlight still elicited circadian phase-shifting responses [10] and the\nhormone melatonin was suppressed [11]. Light-induced suppres-\nsion of melatonin had previously been shown to persist in some\nvisually blind people [12]. These data, as well as the demonstra-\ntion that the spectral sensitivity of non-image forming responses\ndiffered from visual responses also in humans [13,14], were\nCitation: Dijk D-J, Archer SN (2009) Light, Sleep, and Circadian Rhythms:\nTogether Again.

The photopigment mela-\nnopsin is expressed in the inner retina of humans [15] and other\nanimals, and in particular in a subclass of photosensitive retinal\nganglion cells (pRGCs) [16,17]. In mice lacking the gene Opn4,\nwhich codes for melanopsin, phase shifts, pupillary constriction,\nand acute suppression of activity in response to light are all\nattenuated. Abolition of rods and cones, as well as the Opn4 gene,\nabolishes all known image forming and non-image forming effects,\ndemonstrating that both the classical and novel photoreceptive\nsystem contribute to these responses. Several recent, detailed\nstudies have shown that the effects of rod and cones on non-image\nforming responses are transferred to the rest of the brain via the\nlight sensitive ganglion cells [18].\nThe discovery of melanopsin and the pRGCs, together with the\ndemonstration that this system is particularly sensitive to blue light,\nhas inspired many new investigations on the effects of light on\nbrain function and physiology [19]. For example, the combination\nof disrupting Opn4 and Rpe65 (a gene that expresses a protein\ninvolved in chromophore regeneration) can switch an animal from\nbeing nocturnal to diurnal [20]. However, the role of melanopsin\nin sleep regulation has not been investigated until recently.\nRole of Melanopsin in Sleep Regulation\nBefore the discovery of pRGCs, melanopsin, and the associated\nneuroanatomy, the effects of light on sleep were investigated by\nfocusing on known visual areas in the brain, such as the visual\ncortex and the superior colliculus-pretectal area. Lesions in the\nlatter area were indeed shown to greatly reduce the effects of light\non sleep [21]. Recently, attention has switched to the contribution\nof the nonvisual system, and melanopsin in particular. It was\nreported that genetic ablation of Opn4 (Opn42\/2) abolishes the\nlight induction of sleep in mice [22]. In addition, ablation of Opn4\nabolishes the light-induced expression of Fos, which is an early\ngene and often used to identify brain structures that are activated\nby a stimulus, in the superior colliculus and the ventral lateral\npre-optic (VLPO) area. The latter hypothalamic area is of\nFigure 1. Summary of pervasive effects of light. A diffuse network of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs), which also receive input\nfrom rods and cones, are maximally sensitive to blue light between 470 and 480 nm (A). These cells have direct connections to the central circadian\noscillator in the SCN where depending on the time of day (circadian time, CT) light induces changes in gene expression (B). pRGCs also mediate the\nsynchronisation to LD cycles of locomotor activity, and light-induced phase shifts (C). pRGC connections to the olivary pretectal nucleus mediate\nlight-sensitive pupil constriction (D), and indirect input via the SCN regulates the light-sensitive suppression of melatonin production in the pineal (E).\nThe pRGC network has direct connections to sleep regulatory structures such as the VLPO and thereby modulates sleep and the ECoG during\nwakefulness (F). Blue light can modify brain responses to an executive task, as measured using fMRI (G) (figure adapted from [33], with permission),\nand can improve alertness (H) during the morning, lunch time, and early evening (figure based on data published in [32]).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pbio.1000145.g001\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 2 June 2009 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e1000145\nparticular interest because it receives a direct input from pRGCs\n[23] and plays a key role in sleep regulation [24]. Although in this\nexperiment, light was administered only during the dark phase,\ni.e., when the nocturnal mouse is active, it was concluded that the\ndirect photic mediation of sleep is predominantly mediated by\nOPN4. Subsequently, Altimus and colleagues investigated the\neffects of light on ECoG sleep in Opn42\/2 mice, in mice in which\nthe rod and cone pathways are disabled, and in mice lacking the\npRGCs [25]. These authors reported that both rod\/cone and\nmelanopsin pathways contribute to light-induced sleep. The effects\nof light on sleep were again investigated at the beginning of the\ndark phase. In addition, they investigated the effects of a dark\npulse at the beginning of the light phase and report that both the\nrod\/cone and the melanopsin system contribute to the dark pulse-\ninduced wakefulness.\nRole of Melanopsin in Sleep Regulation: Recent\nAdvances\nAlthough these previous studies implicated melanopsin as a\nmediator of the effects of light on sleep, many central questions\nremain unanswered. Important questions to be addressed are as\nfollows: (1) Are all effects of light mediated by melanopsin, or do\nrods and cones also play a role? (2) Do these effects vary across the\ncircadian cycle, i.e., do they differ between night and day? (3) Do\nthese effects only change the timing of sleep, or do they also\nchange the structure of sleep, the response to sleep loss, i.e., sleep\nhomeostasis, and the quality of sleep and waking as assessed by\nECoG oscillations?\nIn the current issue of PLoS Biology, Tsai and colleagues [26]\nreport a detailed study on the effects of light and darkness on sleep\nand on brain activity in wild type and Opn42\/2 mice. The study\nprovides much additional information on the effects of light on\nsleep and the role of melanopsin. In contrast to most previous\nstudies, in which the effects of light on sleep were investigated only\nduring the biological night, Tsai and colleagues quantified these\neffects during both the biological night and biological day. The\ndata show that the light-induced sleep response is abolished in\nOpn42\/2 mice during the dark phase, but persists nearly\nunattenuated during the light phase. Thus, the contribution of\nOPN4 to sleep induction appears to be most prominent during the\ndark phase, whereas during the light phase rods and cones provide\na substantial contribution to this effect. Another innovative aspect\nof this study is the detailed analysis of the effects of both light and\ndarkness on sleep\u2013wake behaviour. In contrast to previous studies,\nin which the effects of light and melanopsin, on sleep and waking\nwere only investigated by visual scoring of ECoG, the authors\napplied quantitative analyses of these brain oscillations. This\nallowed the demonstration of effects of light and darkness and the\ncontribution of melanopsin to the \u2018\u2018quality\u2019\u2019 of waking. The data\nshow that, whereas in both wild-type and Opn42\/2 mice darkness\ninduced an equivalent increase in wakefulness, the quality of this\nalerting effect of darkness differed between the genotypes. The\nalerting response, as indexed by ECoG theta and gamma\noscillations, was significantly delayed in Opn42\/2 mice. Another\nfascinating observation is that, under baseline conditions, Opn42\/2\nmice slept approximately 1 h less during the day (light phase). This\nreduction in sleep duration was primarily related to an extension\nof the wake bout length, i.e., wake consolidation, in Opn42\/2 mice\nduring the light phase. Thus, in the absence of melanopsin, the\nlight-induced transition from wakefulness to sleep is delayed.\nDespite this increased wake duration, ECoG SWA, a marker of\nsleep homeostasis and depth of sleep, was significantly attenuated\nin Opn42\/2, in particular during the dark phase. This observation\nimplies that lack of OPN4 may affect a fundamental aspect of sleep\nhomeostasis, i.e., the build-up of sleep pressure during wakefulness.\nThis interpretation was substantiated by the demonstration that\nthe response to 6 h of sleep deprivation was also significantly\nattenuated in Opn42\/2 mice.\nImportance and Implications of the Findings\nIt has been known for some time that light, circadian processes,\nand sleep homeostasis all contribute to sleep duration, sleep\nstructure, and the ECoG during both sleep and wakefulness. It was\nthought that these processes were, to a large extent, independent\nand separate. However, the current study demonstrates that they\ninteract and that alteration of light input to the brain by genetic\nablation of melanopsin alters sleep duration, wake consolidation,\nthe quality of wakefulness as quantified by ECoG, as well as sleep\nhomeostasis. The current findings will be very useful for the\ndevelopment of animal models to study some of the recently\ndescribed novel effects of light on brain function in humans. For\nexample, exposure to (blue) light leads to changes in PET- or\nfMRI-detected brain responses to a cognitive task in humans\nduring the night and day [27\u201329]. Blue light has been shown to be\nmore effective than green light (the maximum sensitivity of the\nclassical visual system) in attenuating the increase in sleepiness and\ndeterioration of performance in the evening and during the night\n[30,31]. Enriching office light with blue light leads to an increase\nin reported performance and a reduction in daytime sleepiness, as\nwell as an improvement in reported night-time sleep quality [32].\nThese recent findings reinforce that light is not just for vision\nand light is not just for time keeping. Light\u2013dark input shapes the\ntemporal organization of behaviour through its continuous\nmodulatory effects on brain function in interaction with the\ncircadian timing system. This has significant implications not only\nfor a greater understanding of these systems and how they interact,\nbut also for our increased awareness of the importance of both\nnatural and artificial light for human health and well being in\nsociety.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Dr. Daan van der Veen for preparing the figure.\nReferences\n1.
