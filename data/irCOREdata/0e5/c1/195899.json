A major element of the growth induction process has been shown to involve \nthe catecholamines binding to the high affinity ferric iron binding proteins transferrin and lactoferrin, \nwhich then enables bacterial acquisition of normally inaccessible sequestered host iron. The nature of \nthe mechanism(s) by which the stress hormones perturb iron binding of these key innate immune \ndefense proteins has not been fully elucidated. The present study employed EPR spectroscopy and \nchemical iron binding analyses to demonstrate that catecholamine stress hormones form direct \ncomplexes with the ferric iron within transferrin and lactoferrin. Moreover, these complexes were \nshown to result in the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and the loss of protein-complexed iron. Use of \nbacterial ferric iron uptake mutants further showed that both the Fe(II) and Fe(III) released from the \nTf could be directly used as bacterial nutrient sources. We also analyzed the transferrin-\ncatecholamine interactions in human serum and found that therapeutically relevant concentrations of \nstress hormones and inotropes could directly affect the iron binding of serum-transferrin, such that \nthe normally highly bacteriostatic tissue fluid became significantly more supportive of growth of \nbacteria. The relevance of these catecholamine-transferrin\/lactoferrin interactions to the infectious \ndisease process is considered. \n \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION \nIron is a key nutritional element required for the growth of almost all bacteria (15, 22); therefore its \nsequestration by the mammalian ferric iron-binding proteins (principally transferrin, Tf, in serum, \nand lactoferrin, Lf, in mucosal secretions) represents a primary non-specific host-defence mechanism \nagainst microbial infection. Tf has one of the highest metal binding affinities recorded, a binding \nconstant for ferric iron of 10-23 M (16). The principal physiological role of serum Tf is Fe transport \nthrough the circulating blood and its release to Fe-dependent cells; its concentration in serum is \nusually about 35 \u00b5M (16).  Importantly, serum-Tf is not iron-replete with about 70% of it existing in \nthe apo-form (16). Work from our laboratories has shown that the \u201cfight or flight\u201d catecholamine \nstress hormones epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (Dop), and the widely used \nstructurally similar inotropes (heart and kidney therapeutic drugs) isoprenaline and dobutamine, are \nall able to form complexes with Tf and Lf (7, 8, 10, 21). This complex formation is important \nmicrobiologically as it reduces the Fe-binding capability of these key innate immune defence \nproteins to an almost insignificant level, and renders them vulnerable to Fe theft by bacterial \npathogens that would be unable to access this normally highly secure iron. We and others have \nshown that these catecholamines are all able to support greater than million-fold increases in \nbacterial growth by providing iron from Tf (1, 7-8, 10-11, 21). Significantly, in terms of their ability \nto deliver Tf\/Lf-complexed iron to bacteria, certain pharmacologically inactive catechol-containing \nmetabolites were also found to be similar in potency and effect to the parent catecholamine molecule \n(8).  \nThe interaction between catecholamines, Tf and Lf can reduce the bacteriostatic nature of \nblood and serum and mucosal secretions to the extent that they become a highly supportive bacterial \nculture medium (7-8, 10-11, 21). This ability of stress hormones to mediate bacterial acquisition of \nthe Tf\/Lf-iron has been shown to have important clinical implications, for example, they have been \nproposed to have roles in sepsis due to the formation of staphylococcal biofilms in intravenous lines \n 4 \n(18) and in the development of stress-related intra-abdominal sepsis by Gram-negative bacteria (8). \nAlthough we and others have identified some of the molecular components which bacteria use to \nacquire iron from these stress hormone-Tf\/Lf complexes (1, 4, 7, 9, 25), the precise mechanism(s) by \nwhich the catecholamines themselves modulate Tf- and Lf- iron-binding remain to be determined. \nElucidation of the mechanism by which stress elaborated hormones enable bacterial pathogen access \nto host sequestered iron is therefore important both scientifically and clinically. Because the iron \nwithin Tf and Lf is in a high spin Fe(III) oxidation state (16), and therefore paramagnetic, electron \nparamagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry is an ideal tool to study the dynamics of the interaction \nbetween the catecholamines and the Tf and Lf. The present study utilises EPR spectrometry, \nbiochemical and microbiological approaches to elucidate the mechanism by which catecholamine \nstress hormones and inotropes liberate Tf and Lf-complexed Fe. \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nReagents. Human serum transferrin, lactoferrin, ferrous ammonium sulfate, ferric nitrate, 3-(2-\npyridyl)-5,6-bis(4-phenylsulfonic acid)-1,2,4- triazine (ferrozine), and the catecholamines NE, Epi \nand Dop, dobutamine and isoprenaline were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Poole, Dorset. \nUK). [55Fe]FeCl3 (IES, specific activity 5 mCi\/mg Fe), was obtained from Amersham Life Science, \nUK.   \nAnalysis of Tf\/Lf-catecholamine interactions. Tf and Lf samples for EPR analysis were prepared \nby mixing 6 mg\/ml of iron saturated Tf or Lf (60 \u00b5M concentration) buffered in 50 mM Tris-HCl, \npH 7.5 with the concentrations of catecholamines indicated in individual experiments, or with an \nequivalent volume of water in the case of the control sample. Serum-Tf was analyzed in serum \nprepared freshly from the blood of healthy donors. The Tf\/Lf-catecholamine and serum-Tf-\ncatecholamine mixtures once prepared were either incubated at 37oC for the time indicated in the \ntext, or frozen and analyzed immediately. amples were frozen in 0.40 ml volumes in liquid nitrogen \n 5 \nor helium and analyzed using either a JEOL-RE1X EPR or a Bruker EMX-500 Spectrometer. EPR \nspectrometer analysis parameters were: centre field: 150 mT sweep width: 80 mT, field modulation: \n1.0 mT, microwave power: 10 mW, time scan: 14 min with the reaction conducted at a temperature \nof 77K. Analysis of Tf iron removal was also carried out using electrophoresis on urea \npolyacrylamide gels containing 6 M urea, as described previously (7). Ferrous iron release from \nTf\/Lf was monitored by complexation with the ferrous iron specific dye ferrozine (0.4 mM) and \nmeasured spectrophotometrically at 560 nm over a 24 hour period using a Varioskan \nspectrophotometer (Thermo, UK).  \n \nBacterial growth and iron uptake analyses. Demonstration of the role of ferrous iron uptake \nsystems in the mechanism of bacterial iron assimilation from Tf was carried out using enterobactin \nsiderophore synthesis and uptake mutants (entA and tonB) of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (9). To test \nthe ability of the E. coli O157:H7 strains to acquire iron from Tf, 5 ml of sterile SAPI medium (7, 9) \nbuffered with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was supplemented with 100 \u00b5M NE or an equivalent volume \nof water. Filter-sterilized [55Fe]-Tf was prepared as described in (7) and added at 2x105 cpm ml-1 \n(equivalent to a concentration of 10 \u00b5g ml-1 Tf), either directly into the medium (in contact with the \nbacteria) or enclosed within 1 cm diameter dialysis membrane (4 kDa cut-off). Exponential growing \nbacteria were added directly to uptake assay mixtures at 2x108 CFU ml-1, and incubated at 37oC in a \n5% CO2 atmosphere for 4 h, during which time there was essentially no additional growth. Cultures \nwere then harvested, washed in PBS and assayed for cell numbers and [55Fe] incorporation as \ndescribed previously (7, 9). \nTo analyze the growth of bacteria in human serum after the addition of therapeutically relevant \nconcentrations of inotropes, 102 CFU ml-1Staphylococcus epidermidis was added, and the mixture \nincubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified, static 5 % CO2 incubator for 18 hrs; final cell numbers were \ndetermined by mixing, serial dilution of the cultures and plating on luria agar. \n 6 \nChemical structures. The chemical complexes shown in Figure 5 were created using the \nChemDraw Ultra 10 Chem Office drawing package (Cambridge Software, UK). \nStatistical analyses. All experiments were performed in at least duplicate, and on at least 3 separate \noccasions. Where appropriate, statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t-test in which a \ntwo-tailed P value was calculated (Instat program, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). \nStatistical significance was defined as a P value of less than 0.05. \n \nRESULTS \nEPR analysis of Tf-catecholamine interactions. NE was chosen as our principal test catecholamine \nbecause of its widespread distribution in the human body and its involvement in the mammalian \nstress response, and because the majority of previous reports which describe the interaction of stress \nhormones with Tf and Lf have focused on this catecholamine (11). The EPR spectrum of iron-replete \nTf in the presence of increasing NE concentrations is shown in Figure 1A. Tf alone has a di-peak \nEPR signal, with g value of 4.3 (150 mT field strength), which is universally accepted as the \nsignature spectrum of iron-replete holo-Tf and corresponds to the presence of bound high-spin \nFe(III) iron (3, 14). Addition of the catecholamine NE to Tf resulted in a rapid and distinct \ntransformation of the Tf EPR signal (Figure 1A), with the characteristic di-peak Tf profile being \nreplaced by a new single peak EPR signal. Figure 1A shows that the disappearance of the \ncharacteristic iron-replete Tf-iron signal in the presence of the catecholamine was concentration \ndependent, and the higher the molar ratio of NE:Tf, the greater the loss of the Tf-iron signal. \nThe emergence of a new EPR signal when Tf was incubated with NE indicates that \nmodification of the Tf-Fe complex must have occurred; this could be due either to the release of iron \nfrom the Tf, a change in the valency of the iron, or modification of the Tf protein (7). That this new \nsignal\u2019s emergence was associated with a physical loss of iron from the Tf was confirmed using urea \nPAGE analysis of the Tf-NE complex (Figure 1B); this data shows that in the presence of the \n 7 \ncatecholamine most of the initially iron replete Tf was converted into the mono-ferric or apo-form of \nthe protein. Since it has been demonstrated that NE can complex inorganic iron (III) salts (5, 12), we \nalso determined the EPR spectra of NE-Fe(III) and NE- Fe(II) mixtures. We used the Fe salts at 120 \n\u00b5M, a total iron concentration similar to that used in the Tf-NE experiments in Figure 1A.  Figure 1C \nshows that NE-iron mixtures form an EPR-detectable signal with similar g value characteristics to \nthe new signal produced when Tf was incubated with NE, suggesting complex formation has \noccurred (iron salts or NE alone are EPR silent, data not shown). Addition of an iron(II) sink in the \nform of ferrozine reduced the signal intensity of the Fe(III)-NE signal; this effect was possibly due to \nthe ferrozine complexation protecting the reduced Fe from spontaneous re-oxidation (air was not \nexcluded from our experiments). It is also notable that the signal intensity of the product formed \nfrom the NE-Fe(II) iron salt interaction was much less intense than that of the NE-Fe(III) indicating \ngreater abundance for the NE-Fe(III) complex, and showing that at the physiological pH of our \nexperiments NE has a greater affinity for ferric iron, a finding in agreement with other studies (5, \n12).   \nThe question then arose as to how NE was modifying the Fe(III) within the Tf protein to \ncause its removal. Insight into the likely oxidation state of the Fe liberated from Tf can be seen in \nFigure 1D, which shows a urea gel of the iron binding status of NE-treated Tf in the presence of \nferrozine, an Fe(II)-specific dye. Comparison of Figure 1D with Figure 1B reveals that the presence \nof the Fe(II) sink results in a much more rapid and extensive removal of Tf-iron by the \ncatecholamine. This observation is confirmed in Figure 1E, which shows that the production of \nFe(II) from the NE-treated Tf in Figure 1D correlated with the catecholamine-mediated loss of iron \nfrom the protein; importantly the iron (II) sink used, ferrozine, alone had no effect on Tf-iron binding \n(data not shown). Although Tf has, at 10-22M, one of the highest binding affinities for iron in the \nbiological world, this affinity is specific for ferric iron not ferrous (16), which may explain the loss \nof iron observed. \n 8 \nPrevious work from our laboratories has shown that in addition to NE, a number of other \ncatecholamines and structurally related molecules are also capable of liberating Tf-complexed iron \nand providing it to bacteria for growth (1, 7-8, 10, 18, 21). We therefore undertook analyses similar \nto those shown in Figure 1 for Epi and Dop (Figure 2). Epi (Figures 2A-D) clearly liberates Tf-\ncomplexed iron by a mechanism similar to that demonstrated for NE, specifically, by iron reduction. \nIn contrast, while we have clearly shown that Dop can remove Tf-iron (8, 10, 21), a similar analytical \napproach to that used for NE and Epi produced a somewhat different spectrum of data. Figure 2E-H \nshows that the EPR spectrum of Tf in the presence of Dop underwent the characteristic change \nindicative of catecholamine-iron binding, however higher concentrations of dopamine and longer \nincubation (24 hours) as well as the presence of a ferrous iron sink (ferrozine) were required to \nachieve a clear EPR signal change (Figure 2E). Incubating Dop with Tf and ferrozine did not result \nin the expected Fe(II)-ferrozine complex formation, and the mixture became a dark brown colour \nwhich also showed absorption at 560 nm (Figure 2F); further investigations showed this was due to \nthe oxidation of the dopamine (data not shown). Urea gel electrophoresis, however, showed that \nthere was still Dop-induced loss of iron from Tf which was enhanced in the presence of ferrozine, \nthough the overall iron loss from Tf (compare Figures 2G-H) was less than that observed with the \nother catecholamines (Figure 1B-D and Figure 2B-C). This difference in catecholamine potency may \nhave its explanation in the chemical nature of the anion of the catecholamine-salts. NE and Epi were \npurchased as bitartrate salts (the clinically used formulations) whereas dopamine is obtainable only \nas a hydrochloride. Fortuitously, Epi is available both as bitartrate and hydrochloride salt, and \ntherefore we were able to carry out the analyses shown in Figure 2B-D using Epi hydrochloride. The \nresults obtained were very similar to those shown for Dop (data not shown), and revealed that while \ncatecholamine-mediated Fe(III) reduction of Tf-iron was occurring, the chloride anion interfered \nwith this process, probably by competing for the ferric iron pool (by forming FeCl3) and so reducing \nthe available iron for the catecholamine complex formation. \n 9 \nAdditional analyses of the type shown in Figures 1 and 2 were also performed using the \nsynthetic catecholamine inotropic agents isoprenaline and dobutamine, which we had previously \nshown were also provide to bacteria Tf and Lf-complexed iron (8, 21). Both catecholamines \nproduced results that indicated their mechanism of iron removal from Tf involved ferric iron \nreduction (data not shown). \n \nLf-catecholamine interactions. Previous studies (7, 8) have shown that NE and other \ncatecholamines can also facilitate removal of iron from Lf and supply it for bacterial growth. \nTherefore, we tested whether the mechanism demonstrated for Tf, involving catecholamine-mediated \nferric iron reduction, could be applicable to Lf as well. Figure 3A shows the change in EPR spectrum \nof NE-treated Lf, which parallels the profile of the EPR changes observed with Tf (Figure 1A). \nLactoferrin resolves very poorly on urea gels (7), therefore we were not able to directly demonstrate \nFe loss from Lf using urea gel electrophoresis. However, Figure 3B illustrates the time course of \nferrozine complexation of NE-released Lf-iron and shows a clear time dependent increase in \nferrozine-Fe(II) production. This indicates that the mechanism by which NE liberated Lf-iron is \nsimilar to that shown for Tf and involves reduction of the Lf-associated Fe(III). What was \nsignificantly different about NE-Lf interactions from those shown with Tf was the time taken for the \ncatecholamine to remove the Lf-complexed iron; as monitored by EPR spectrometry, iron removal \n(and signal change) typically required up to 72 hrs, while for Tf this process typically required less \nthan 2 hrs. \n \nBacterial uptake of Tf-iron in the presence of catecholamines utilizes both ferrous and ferric \nuptake systems. Multiple reports have shown a positive correlation between growth stimulation by \nNE (and other catecholamines) and bacterial acquisition of iron from Tf (1, 7-9, 18, 21). \nAdditionally, we and other groups have demonstrated that for bacteria such as Bordetella, E. coli, \n 10 \nand Salmonella siderophore-based ferric iron acquisition systems are central elements in the \nmechanism of this growth induction process (1, 7, 9, 25). Our initial studies suggested that the role of \nthe siderophore is to bind and internalise the catecholamine-released Tf iron (9). \nTable 1 shows the influence of NE on bacterial uptake of [55Fe] from [55Fe]-Tf on wildtype E. \ncoli and ferric iron acquisition mutants (deletions in entA and tonB) (9) when in direct contact with \nthe 55Fe-Tf, or with the [55Fe]-Tf sequestered away in dialysis membrane (but still accessible to any \nlow molecular weight iron-chelating solutes released by the bacteria). Overall, whether in direct or \nindirect contact, the siderophore synthesis and uptake mutants assimilated from the [55Fe]-Tf much \nless [55Fe] than their wildtype parent, thereby demonstrating for E. coli the importance of a complete \nferric iron acquisition system in uptake of Tf-iron. For wildtype bacteria, NE significantly increased \nuptake of [55Fe] in both contact and non-contact conditions (P<0.001). In contrast, for the ferric iron \nacquisition mutants the influence of the catecholamine was dependent on the proximity of the \nbacteria to the [55Fe]-Tf. When they were sequestered within the dialysis tubing, not only did the \nmutants acquire less iron than wildtype, but the presence of NE could significantly reduce [55Fe] \nincorporation (p<0.001). In contrast, when the siderophore mutants (which are wildtype for ferrous \niron uptake) were in close physical association with the [55Fe]-Tf the catecholamine significantly \nenhanced [55Fe] incorporation (p<0.001). Since we have clearly shown in the current report that \ncatecholamines can reduce Tf-iron, this enhanced provision of [55Fe] by NE in ferric iron uptake \nmutants indicates that bacterial ferrous iron acquisition systems are also providing an additional route \nof entry of Tf-sequestered iron into the bacterial cell. \n \nThe possible clinical significance of the catecholamine-Tf interaction. The experiments described \nso far have used high concentrations of catecholamines to elucidate the mechanism by which stress \nhormones and inotropic agents liberate Tf and Lf-iron. A question important to human healthcare is \nwhether at therapeutic catecholamine concentrations (\u00b5M) these widely utilized drugs, which may be \n 11 \nprescribed to up to half of intensive care patients (23) might affect the integrity of Tf iron binding to \nthe extent that they reduce the bacteriostatic nature of blood. We therefore isolated fresh serum from \nwhole human blood, added concentrations of NE and Dop attainable in clinical settings (up to 10 \n\u00b5M) (26), and assessed changes in both the EPR spectrum of the serum Tf-Fe, and the ability of the \nsame serum to restrict bacterial growth. As can be seen (Figure 4A), after 24 hrs treatment the \nclinically attainable concentration of inotropes consistently caused a reduction in the intensity of the \nserum-Tf EPR signal. We also analyzed the ability of this serum to modulate the growth of infectious \nbacteria (in this case a 18 hr incubation with a 102 CFU\/ml inoculum of Staphylococcus epidermidis, \na skin bacterium known to cause nosocomial infections (6, 18, 21). We found that compared with the \ngrowth levels of control cultures, NE and Dop-treatment of the serum typically increased the growth \nof the bacteria a factor of between 3 and 7-fold (in the case of Figure 4B  the reduction was 4 and \n3.5-fold, respectively) (P<0.01). This indicates that clinically relevant doses of inotropic agents can \ncompromise the iron-binding integrity of Tf, and by so doing, potentially make serum less \nbacteriostatic and thereby render blood more supportive of the proliferation of infectious bacteria. \n \nDISCUSSION \nIron is an essential nutrient for the growth of the majority of bacteria and, especially in the case of \npathogenic species, accessing host-iron normally sequestered by Tf and Lf can be a decisive factor in \ndetermining the outcome of an infection (15, 22). Previously, we and others have shown that \ntreatment of Tf or Lf with the catecholamine stress hormones NE, Epi and Dop or the inotropic \nagents isoprenaline and dobutamine resulted in the release of iron from the Tf or Lf iron-protein \ncomplex, which then became accessible for bacterial uptake and growth (1, 7-9, 10, 21). In the \ncurrent study we demonstrate that the mechanism by which this host iron accession process occurs is \nvia direct catecholamine binding of Tf\/Lf-complexed iron, with the resultant reduction of the Tf\/Lf-\ncoordinated Fe(III) to Fe(II), an iron valency for which these iron sequestering proteins have much \n 12 \nreduced binding affinity (16). Although it has been shown that bacterial siderophore-based Fe(III) \nuptake systems are integral elements in the catecholamine growth induction process (1, 4, 7, 9) in the \ncurrent report we also demonstrate that catecholamines can deliver host-sequestered iron to bacteria \nthrough Fe(II) as well as Fe(III) uptake systems.  \nOur EPR spectroscopy findings that NE, Epi and Dop could complex Tf-iron and alter the \nEPR signal from Tf are in general agreement with the work of Borisenko et al (3). These workers \nexamined the interaction of Tf with a neurotoxic analogue of dopamine, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-\nOHDA), as part of a study aimed at understanding both the mechanism of toxicity of 6-OHDA, and \nits possible use as a chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of patients with neuroblastoma. \nBorisenko et al showed that the interaction between 6-OHDA and Tf-associated iron resulted in the \ndisappearance of the characteristic double peak EPR signal of iron replete-Tf and the appearance of a \nsingle peak EPR signal at 150 mT (3), a value similar to that seen in the current study. As well as \nbeing important for bacterial growth in host tissues (11), reduction of protein-complexed Fe(III) by \nthe catecholamines has been shown to regulate host enzyme activity. For instance, control of the rate \nlimiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis in mammalian systems (tyrosine synthesis by \nphenylalanine hydroxylase) is achieved by complexation and reduction of the enzyme active site \nFe(III) by the end products NE, Epi and Dop (20). Interestingly, NE and Epi were not found to bind \nto the ferrous form of phenylalanine hydroxylase (20).  Our data is also consistent with chemical \nanalyses that shown that catecholamines can bind inorganic Fe(III) salts  (5, 12). \nTransferrin has its greatest affinity for ferric iron (16), and conceptually, the comparatively weaker \niron binding affinity of the catecholamine leads us to speculate the following order of events in the \niron removal process: catecholamine binds to the Fe(III) within the Tf, reduces it, and the NE-Fe(II) \ncomplex then dissociates (we have found that both NE and Tf-iron are internalised by bacteria) (6, \n9). However, this released Fe(II) is likely when under aerobic conditions to rapidly re-oxidise, and \ntherefore be re-bound by the now iron-depleted Tf. If a sink for the Fe(II) was present, say in the \n 13 \nform of ferrozine, the Fe(II) would be removed from the pool of re-bindable iron, and a net loss of \niron observed from the Tf, which we see in the urea gels of Tf incubated with NE and ferrozine in \nFigures 1 and 2. \nUrea gel electrophoresis of NE, Epi or Dop-treated Tf also showed that all of the catecholamines \nappeared to preferentially remove Tf-iron from the N-terminal iron-binding domain of Tf (Figures \n1B and C, Figure 2B and C and G and H), suggesting that the N-terminal domain could be the initial \ninteraction point for the catecholamines. This result is not entirely surprising since other studies have \nshown that although the N- and C- lobe share a 56% similarity, the rate of iron release from the C-\nlobe is considerably slower than that of the N-lobe (24). Although Tf and Lf show considerable \nhomology in protein sequence and structure, and coordinate iron in a similar fashion, they \nnonetheless display significant differences in their affinity for ferric iron. Wally et al (24) showed \nthat these differences lie in the variation in the structure of their inter-lobe linker; this region, which \nis helical in Lf, and unstructured in Tf, making the removal of iron more difficult from Lf. This could \nexplain the comparative differences in the potency of catecholamine effects on Tf- and Lf-iron \nremoval observed in our current study.  \nThe complexation of Tf-or Lf-iron by the catecholamines provides an important vehicle by \nwhich pathogenic bacteria may access normally inaccessible host-sequestered iron stores. We and \nothers have previously shown, using mutants for enterobactin synthesis and ferric uptake systems, \nthat enterobactin is essential for inducing catecholamine-stimulated growth of enteric pathogens such \nas Bordetella (1) E. coli (9) and Salmonella (25). We also determined that the presence of a \ndihydroxybenzoyl moiety was an essential element in the ability of stress hormones, inotropes and \ntheir metabolites to stimulate bacterial growth through provision of Tf\/Lf iron (4, 7, 21). \nMechanistically, the dihydroxybenzoyl moiety is also important for Fe(III) binding in catecholate \nsiderophores such as enterobactin (15, 22). Figure 5 shows a molecular comparison of the structure \nof the norepinephrine-Fe complex with that of the enterobactin-Fe complex. What is most striking is \n 14 \nthe obvious similarity in the geometry of iron complexation by the two catechol-containing \nmolecules. Enterobactin, like the catecholamine stress hormones, can also liberate Tf-iron though its \nspecificity is for ferric iron (15, 22). NE possesses both of these properties of enterobactin, but \ndiffers in that it reduces the ferric iron it binds. This suggests that NE and the other catecholamines \nmight be best considered as a kind of pseudo- siderophore.  \nIn terms of the further relevance of catecholamine-Tf\/Lf interactions to the infectious disease \nprocess, we must consider the site where bacteria, catecholamines and Lf are most often co-localized, \nthe gut (8, 19). This current work could provide insights into the mechanism by which elevations in \ncatecholamine levels which occur during acute stress, can cause the often-observed overgrowth and \ntranslocation of the gut microflora (2, 17). Our finding that catecholamine-mediated removal of Lf \niron requires greater than 24 hrs is consistent with the findings that response of gut microflora to the \nchanges in systemic stress hormone levels can occur a day or more after the stress event (17). It \nshould not then be surprising, given this potentially dangerous scenario of catecholamine-Lf-\nbacterial interactions, that mammals have evolved mechanisms to tightly regulate levels of gut \ncatecholamines and that catecholamine-degrading enzymes are present throughout the entire length \nof the GI tract (13). Analysis of the gut tissue distribution of the human phenol sulfotransferase \nfamily of catechol-inactivating enzymes show a close correlation with bacterial presence and \nnumbers, with expression lowest in the stomach and greatest in the large intestine and colon (13).   \nAs well as elucidation of the mechanism by which stress hormones can modulate Tf and Lf \nbinding of iron, EPR analysis of catecholamine-Tf interactions could also have potential application \nin human clinical diagnostics. Surveys of hospital drug use have shown that approximately half of \npatients in intensive care units may receive several days of catecholamine inotrope support to \nmaintain heart and kidney function (23, 26); it is also generally recognized that the rate of bacterial \ninfections in intensive care unit patients are significantly higher than those patients in other hospital \nwards. Our data (Figure 4) shows that exposure of serum to pharmacological concentrations of \n 15 \ninotropes can cause changes in the EPR spectrum of serum-TF that can be correlated directly with a \nreduction in its ability to inhibit bacterial growth. But what clinical implications would there be if Tf-\ninotropic drug complex formation was occurring in critically-ill patients? Could such complexation \ndestabilize serum-Tf to such an extent that it would effectively become a bacterial Fe source? The \nsensitivity and speed of EPR would enable an examination of Tf-Fe binding status to be performed in \nminutes, and could provide a valuable assessment of the infection susceptibility status of severely ill \npatients. Examining this possibility is a current objective of our laboratories. \n \n \nFOOTNOTE \n Sara M.
