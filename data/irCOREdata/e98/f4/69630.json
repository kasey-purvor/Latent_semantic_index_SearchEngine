INTRODUCTION\nIt is well known that fluid flow in channels is laminar for small flow velocities and turbulent for large flow\nvelocities.1 The problem of how turbulence originates has long attracted the considerable attention of researchers.\nDifferent scientists responded to this question in different ways. For example, Landau considered the development\nof turbulence as the excitation of self-oscillations, and he wrote a phenomenological equation similar to the\ntruncated van der Pol equation for the amplitude of self-oscillations in a vacuum tube generator, commenting:2\n\u201cWith further increase of the Reynolds number new periods appear sequentially. As for the newly appeared\nmotions, they have increasingly small scales\u201d. As a result, multi-frequency self-oscillations with incommensurate\nfrequencies, i.e. quasi-periodic motion, must set in. Associated with these self-oscillations, there would have\nto be an attractor in the form of a multi-dimensional torus in the system phase space. Over a wide range\nof frequencies such quasi-periodic self-oscillations differ little in appearance from chaotic ones, which is why\ndeveloped turbulence is perceived as a random process.\nIn the 1970s, after the discovery of deterministic chaos and the realization that a multi-dimensional torus\nis unstable,3 the Landau theory became open to question, but the conception of self-oscillations was retained.\nThe difference lay only in that, instead of quasi-periodic self-oscillations, they became spoken of as chaotic ones.\nThus, according to these new ideas, the onset of turbulence is the sudden birth of a strange attractor in the\nphase space of certain dynamical variables.4 We note that similar ideas were repeatedly expressed by Russian\nscientist Neimark.5\nWe suggest, however, that turbulence arising in nonclosed fluid flows is not a self-oscillatory process. It is\nknown that the instability of such flows is of a convective character, rather than being absolute. This means that\na disturbance arising at some point of the flow will not increase indefinitely with time, but will drift downstream.\nIt follows from this property of convectively unstable systems that they are not self-oscillatory, although they\nare amplifiers of disturbances. For such a system to become self-oscillatory, global feedback must be introduced,\nE-mails: landa@phys.msu.su and p.v.e.mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk\nPublished in Noise in Complex Systems and Stochastic Dynamics II, eds.

After N.V. Nikotin.8\ne.g. by closing the system in a ring. It should be noted that, in essence, this is exactly what occurs in the\nprocess of numerical simulation with periodic boundary conditions. Disturbances are necessarily present in all\nreal systems, both from external sources (environmental fluctuations) and as a result of the molecular structure\nof a substance (inherent fluctuations). The disturbances can be included as external forces in the equations\ndescribing the system behavior. Klimontovich used the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to calculate6 the forces\ncaused by the natural fluctuations in hydrodynamic flows. In jet flows the presence of fluctuations, especially\nat the input, is crucial because they are precisely what lead eventually to the turbulent disturbances observed.\nIt follows from this that an approach to turbulence within the framework of (deterministic) dynamical systems\ntheory is not always appropriate.\n2. FLUID FLOW IN A CIRCULAR PIPE\nOne piece of evidence suggesting that turbulence is not a self-oscillatory process comes from the numerical\nexperiments of Nikitin.7, 8 He simulated fluid flow in a circular pipe of a finite length and radius R with a given\nvelocity at the input cross-section, and with so-called \u2018soft\u2019 boundary conditions at the output cross-section;\nthese latter are\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n=\n\u22022\u03be\n\u2202x2\n=\n\u22022\u03b7\n\u2202x2\n= 0, (1)\nwhere u is the longitudinal velocity component, \u03be and \u03b7 are the radial and angular components of vorticity\n\u2126 = curlu, where u = {u, v, w} is the flow velocity vector in cylindrical coordinates x, r and \u03b8. Under these\nconditions a reflected wave apparently does not appear, or is very weak.\nAt the input cross-section of the pipe the longitudinal velocity component was assumed to take to the form\nof a Poiseuille profile u0(1\u2212 r\n2\/R2), weakly disturbed by a harmonic force at the frequency \u03c9 = 0.36u0\/R, i.e.,\nu = u0\n(\n1\u2212\nr2\nR2\n)\n+ARe\n(\nu\u2032(r)e\u2212i\u03c9t\n)\ncos \u03b8,\n(2)\nv = ARe\n(\nv\u2032(r)e\u2212i\u03c9t\n)\ncos \u03b8, w = ARe\n(\nw\u2032(r)e\u2212i\u03c9t\n)\nsin \u03b8,\nwhere u\u2032(r), v\u2032(r) and w\u2032(r) are the components of the Orr\u2013Sommerfeld vector-eigenfunction at frequency \u03c9, R\nis the pipe radius, and A is the disturbance amplitude. The velocity u0 and the pipe radius R were set such that\nthe Reynolds number Re was equal to 4000. As the amplitude A exceeded a certain critical value (A \u2265 Acr),\nFigure 2. Results of numerical experiments on pipe flow. View of the turbulent velocity pulsations (a) with periodic\nboundary conditions and (b) with the boundary conditions (1), (2). After N.V. Nikotin.7\nrandom high-frequency pulsations appeared in the flow after a short time interval. They occupied all the lower\npart of the pipe from x = x0, where x0 depended only weakly on the distance r from the pipe axis. It turned out\nthat the value of x0 decreased as A became larger. The appearance of turbulent pulsations was accompanied by\ncorresponding deformation of the profile of the longitudinal constituent of the mean velocity: at the pipe axis\nthe mean velocity decreased, whereas near the pipe wall it increased. The instantaneous distributions of the\nlongitudinal velocity component in a steady regime for A\/u0 = 0.04 are shown in Fig. 1. We note that a similar\ndeformation of the mean velocity profile with increasing turbulent pulsations occurs in jet flows as well.\nAs the amplitude A gradually decreased, the turbulent region drifted progressively downstream and disap-\npeared at a certain value of A. It is known9 that Poiseuille flow in a circular pipe, in contrast to that in a\nplane channel, possesses the property that laminar flow is stable with respect to small perturbations for any\nReynolds number. However, in the case of sufficiently large Reynolds numbers, such a flow is unstable with\nrespect to finite perturbations. If an attractor existed corresponding to the turbulent mode, and if the role of\nthe harmonic disturbance was to lead phase trajectories into the attractor basin, then turbulence should not\ndisappear following cessation of the harmonic disturbance.\nIt may be inferred from Fig. 1 that the development of turbulence for A \u2265 Acr is associated with a peculiar\nphase transition at the point x = x0 induced by an amplification of the noise that is always present in any\nnumerical experiment owing to rounding errors. The harmonic disturbance plays a dual role. First, it causes\nthe appearance of instability and, secondly, it initiates the phase transition, much as occurs in a pendulum with\na randomly vibrated suspension axis,10 or in jets under low-frequency acoustic forcing.11 It is no accident that\nthe transition to turbulence was observed by Nikitin only for low-frequency disturbances (for Strouhal numbers\nof order 0.1).\nPossible counter-arguments against the above ideas lie in the fact that numerical simulation results obtained\nwith periodic boundary conditions are very close to those observed experimentally. But the data obtained\nby Nikitin in the numerical experiment described above are also close to numerical data for periodic boundary\nconditions.7 The visual similarity of turbulent pulsations calculated for periodic conditions, and for the boundary\nconditions (1), (2), is illustrated in Fig. 2. This similarity may be explained by the fact that many nonlinear\noscillatory systems possess such pronounced intrinsic properties that they exhibit these properties independently\nof the means of excitation. Some examples of such (non-hydrodynamic) systems are described by Landa and\nRabinovitch.12\nNote that our discussion does not apply to so-called closed flows, e.g. to the Couette flow between two rotating\ncylinders or spheres. In closed flows there is always feedback linking the output of the amplifier to its input, so\nthat they consequently become self-oscillatory.\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nU\n\/U\n0\nx\/D\na\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\u03b5 u\nx\/D\nb\nFigure 3.

A PHASE TRANSITION IN JET FLOWS\nA peculiar phase transition at a certain distance xcr from the nozzle, induced by an amplification of the input\nnoise, is also observed experimentally in jet flows. It reveals itself both in the drastic decrease of the mean\nvelocity and in the drastic increase of the turbulent pulsation intensity. The value of xcr is the smaller the larger\nis the noise intensity \u01ebu(0) at the nozzle exit section. This is illustrated in Fig. 3.\nThe phase transition can be controlled by harmonic acoustic forcing at an appropriate frequency. The value\nof xcr increases in the case of high-frequency forcing (Sta > 1.5) and decreases in the case of low-frequency\nforcing (0.2 < Sta < 1.5), where Sta = \u03c9aD\/U0 is the Strouhal number corresponding to the acoustic wave of\nfrequency \u03c9a (see Fig. 4). Effects similar to those described above are also observed for other means of periodic\nforcing of the jet: e.g. longitudinal or radial vibration of the nozzle, or a pulsating rate of fluid outflow from the\nnozzle.11\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.2\n0.0\n0.4\n10 20\nx\/D x\/D\nU\n\/U\n0\na b\n15\n10\n5\n0 10 1010\n\u03b5 u\nFigure 4.

ANALOGY TO PENDULUM WITH RANDOMLY VIBRATED SUSPENSION\nAXIS\nThe hypothesis that the onset of turbulence can usefully be considered as a noise-induced phase transition was\nfirst proposed by Landa,13 who studied the simplest physical system wherein such a transition is possible: the pen-\ndulum with a randomly vibrated suspension axis.10, 14\u201317 It was found that profound parallels exist18\u201321between\nturbulent processes in nonclosed fluid flows and noise-induced oscillations in such a pendulum.\nIn the simplest case, when additive noise is neglected, the equation describing the oscillations of a pendulum\nwith a randomly vibrated suspension axis is:\n\u03d5\u00a8+ 2\u03b2\n(\n1 + \u03b1\u03d5\u02d92\n)\n\u03d5\u02d9+ \u03c920 (1 + \u03be(t)) sin\u03d5 = 0, (3)\nwhere \u03d5 is the pendulum\u2019s angular deviation from the equilibrium position, 2\u03b2\n(\n1 + \u03b1\u03d5\u02d92\n)\n\u03d5\u02d9 is proportional to the\nmoment of the friction force which is assumed to be nonlinear, \u03c90 is the natural frequency of small oscillations,\nand \u03be(t) is a comparatively wide-band random process with nonzero power spectral density at the frequency 2\u03c90.\nWhen the intensity of the suspension axis vibration, characterized by the spectral density of \u03be(t) at frequency\n2\u03c90 (\u03ba(2\u03c90)), exceeds a certain critical value proportional to the friction factor \u03b2, excitation of pendulum oscilla-\ntions occurs, and the variance of the pendulum\u2019s angular deviation becomes nonzero. It should be noted that close\nto the excitation threshold, the pendulum oscillations possess the property of so called on\u2013off\u2013intermittency.22\nAs described23 by Frisch and Morf, high-pass filtering of turbulent velocity pulsations reveals their intermit-\ntent behavior. This phenomenon was studied20 both for experimental velocity pulsations in a jet measured by\nZaikin and also for the pendulum oscillations considered above. In each case it was observed on-off intermit-\ntency after high-pass filtering. This fact can be considered as an additional argument in support of the parallels\nbetween noise-induced pendulum oscillations and turbulent processes in jets.\nIt is important to note that the response of the pendulum to a small additional harmonic force (additional\nvibration of the suspension axis) is similar to the response of a jet to an acoustic force.\nThus, just as in the case of turbulent jets, the noise-induced pendulum oscillations under consideration can\nbe controlled by a small additional harmonic force. Its inclusion can be effected by substitution into Eq. (3)\nof \u03be + a cos\u03c9at in place of \u03be, where a and \u03c9a are respectively the amplitude and frequency of the additional\nvibration of the suspension axis. If the frequency of the additional forcing is relatively low, then this forcing\nintensifies the pendulum oscillations and lowers the excitation threshold; vice versa, a relatively high-frequency\nforcing suppresses the pendulum oscillations and increases the excitation threshold. The intensification of the\npendulum oscillations by a low-frequency additional vibration is illustrated in Fig. 5 for two values of the vibration\nfrequency. We see that the lower the forcing frequency is, the larger the variance of the oscillation becomes. Just\nas for jets, when the forcing amplitude becomes relatively large, the pendulum\u2019s oscillation amplitude saturates.\nFigure 6. Numerical simulation showing the effect of a high frequency harmonic force a cos\u03c9t on the variance of the\npendulum angle \u03c6. Results are shown for \u03c90 = 1, \u03b2 = 0.1, \u03b1 = 100, \u03ba(2\u03c90)\/\u03bacr = 5.6 and: (a) \u03c9a = 3.5; (b) \u03c9a = 6; (c)\n\u03c9a = 11; (d) \u03c9a = 19.757.\nBelow we consider the possibility of suppressing noise-induced pendulum oscillations by the addition of a\nhigh-frequency vibration. Numerical simulation of Eq. (3) with \u03be + a cos\u03c9at in place of \u03be, where \u03c9a > 2, shows\nthat such suppression can occur. The results of the simulation are illustrated in Fig. 6, where the dependences of\nthe variance of the angle \u03d5 on a for a number of values of the vibration frequency are shown. It is evident from\nthis figure that, for small amplitudes of the high-frequency vibration, this vibration has little or no effect on the\nnoise-induced oscillations. As the amplitude increases, however, the intensity of the noise-induced oscillations\ndecreases rapidly. When the amplitude exceeds a certain critical value (for \u03c9a = 19.757 it is equal to 42) the\noscillations are suppressed entirely. As the amplitude increases further the oscillations reappear, but now because\nthe conditions required for parametric resonance come into play. For smaller frequencies \u03c9a, the behavior of the\npendulum oscillations is different. It is seen that the variance of \u03d5 at first decreases, passes through a certain\nminimum value, and then increases again. It is important to note that this minimum value becomes smaller\nwith increasing forcing frequency, but that it is attained for larger forcing amplitudes at higher frequencies. The\ndependence shown in Fig. 6 a closely resembles the corresponding dependences for a jet presented in Fig. 7.\nThe dependences of \u03c3 on \u03c9a for a number of fixed amplitudes of the additional vibration are illustrated in\nFig. 8. Again, these dependences closely resemble the corresponding ones for a jet shown in Fig. 9.\nThe presence of a small additive noise, in addition to the multiplicative one in Eq. (3), does not change the\nbehavior of the pendulum qualitatively, but it gives rise to large quantitative differences. The principal one is the\nimpossibility of achieving full suppression of the pendulum oscillations. Nevertheless, a very marked attenuation\nof the oscillation intensity occurs. It should be emphasized that, in the case of turbulence, full suppression is of\ncourse impossible.\nFigure 7.

APPLICATION OF KRYLOV\u2013BOGOLYUBOV METHOD\nWe have studied the onset of turbulence in subsonic submerged jets analytically by using the asymptotic Krylov\u2013\nBogolyubov method.25 This is possible when the intensity of the input noise is sufficiently small that the turbulent\nprocesses near the nozzle can be described by linearized Navier\u2013Stokes equations. Apparently, for real jets the\nintensity of the input noise is much more than that is necessary for the validity of our theory. It is possible that\nsuch small input noise is present in jet flows of superfluid helium.26 Nevertheless, explicit consideration of the\namplification of the input noise allows us to account for many known experimental results within the initial part\nof a jet and find a clearly defined phase transition. Moreover, it follows from our theory that the commonly\naccepted explanation for the well-known shift of velocity pulsation power spectra towards the low-frequency\nregion is in fact erroneous. According to this explanation, the shift of the power spectra occurs because of\nfeedback via an acoustic wave generated where vortex pairing occurs, as seen in experiments. We will show that\nthe reason for the spectral shift lies in the jet\u2019s divergence; and that this shift causes the increase of spatial scale\nFigure 8.

Results of a calculation based on the Krylov\u2013Bogolyubov method. The dependences on the Strouhal number St\nfor different x of: (a) \u0393 and (b) the wave phase velocity vph are shown for the values of x indicated near the corresponding\ncurve in each case.\nwhere \u2206 =\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n+\n\u22022\n\u2202y2\nis the Laplacian, Re = 2U0d\/\u03bd is the Reynolds number, \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity, U0\nis the mean flow velocity in the nozzle center, x is the coordinate along the jet axis, and y is the transverse\ncoordinate. It should be noted that in so deciding on a dimensionless time, the circular frequencies \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f are\nmeasured in units of S = \u03c9d\/U0 \u2261 \u03c0St, where St = 2fd\/U0 is the Strouhal number.\nIn accordance with the ideas presented above, the onset of turbulence is caused by random disturbances\n(noise) in the nozzle exit section. The authors of works27, 28 devoted to the stability of jet flows mostly split the\nsolution into mean values and small random disturbances. In our opinion this procedure is inappropriate for two\nreasons: first, exact equations for the mean values are unknown; and, secondly, the random disturbances make\na significant contribution to the mean values. That is why we split the solution of Eqs. (4), (5) into dynamical\nand stochastic constituents. The dynamical constituents are described by stationary Navier-Stokes equations\nand differ from the mean values of the corresponding variables because of the quadratic nonlinearity.\nWe consider first the dynamical constituents of the velocity and vorticity. It follows from Eqs. (4), (5) that\nthe dynamical constituents ud(x, y), vd(x, y)) and \u2126d(x, y) are described by the equations\n\u2126d(x, y) =\n\u2202ud(x, y)\n\u2202y\n\u2212\n\u2202vd(x, y)\n\u2202x\n, (6)\n\u2202ud(x, y)\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202vd(x, y)\n\u2202y\n= 0, (7)\nud(x, y)\n\u2202\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202x\n+ vd(x, y)\n\u2202\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202y\n\u2212\n2\nRe\n(\n\u22022\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202x2\n+\n\u22022\u2126d(x, y)\n\u2202y2\n)\n= 0. (8)\nIt is very difficult, if not impossible, to solve these nonlinear equations exactly. Therefore we choose ud(x, y)\nin the form of a given function of y with unknown parameters depending on x. The shape of this function\nmust depend on whether the outflow from the nozzle is laminar or turbulent. For simplicity, we restrict our\nconsideration to laminar nozzle flow. In this case we can set ud(x, y) so that, at the nozzle exit section, the\nboundary layer is close in form to that described by the Blasius equation.29 Taking account of the entrainment\nof the ambient fluid, we set the velocity profile close to the Blasius one for x = 0 in the form\nud(x, y) =\n1\n1 + tanh(q\/\u03b400 + r0)\n[\n1\u2212 tanh\n(\nq\n|y| \u2212 1\n\u03b40(x)\n\u2212 r(x)\n)]\n, (9)\nwhere q = 3, \u03b40(x) and r(x) are unknown functions of x, and \u03b40(x) is the boundary layer thickness which is\nequal to \u03b400 for x = 0, r0 = r(0). To find the unknown functions in the expression (9), we use the conservation\nlaws for the fluxes of momentum and energy which we derive starting from Eqs. (6)\u2013(8). As a result we find\nr(x) \u2248 r0 = 0.5 and \u03b40(x) =\n\u221a\n\u03b4200 + 2kx , where k = 16q\n2\/(3Re).\nWe will refer to deviations from the dynamical constituents as stochastic components. To study the jet\nstability we linearize Eqs. (4), (5) relative to these components. It should be noted that finding a solution of the\nlinearized equations for the stochastic components is similar to the well known problem of the linear instability of\na jet flow and reduced to a non-self-adjoint boundary-value problem with zero boundary conditions at y = \u00b1\u221e.\nThe solution of this boundary-value problem allows us to find the gain factor \u0393 and wave phase velocity vph,\nand their dependences on the Strouhal number St. The calculated values of \u0393 and vph as functions of St are\nshown for different x in Fig. 10 a and b. The resonant character of the dependences of the gain factor on the\nStrouhal number that we have found indicates that each jet cross-section can be considered as an oscillator whose\nnatural frequency decreases with increasing distance from the nozzle. This fact justifies consideration of a jet as\na chain of coupled resonant amplifiers, which in turn allows us to understand the analogy between noise-induced\npendulum oscillations and the turbulent processes in a jet.\nBy using the first and second approximations of the Krylov\u2013Bogolyubovmethod we have calculated the change\nof the mean velocity against the longitudinal and transversal coordinates and the variance of the longitudinal\nvelocity pulsations. These calculations allow us to follow the occurrence of the phase transition. The plots of \u01ebu\nversus x are presented in Fig. 11 for two values of y (y = 0 and y = 0.7). It is seen that the found dependences\n00.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\u03b5 u\nx\na\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03b5 u\nx\nb\nFigure 11. Plots of calculated mean-root-square values of turbulent velocity pulsations versus x for (a) y = 0 and (b)\ny = 0.7.\nof \u01ebu on x closely resemble the dependence of the variance of noise-induced pendulum oscillations on the noise\nintensity in the case of small additive noise. As would be expected, at the jet axis the phase transition occurs\nfor larger x than for y = 0.7.\nThe increase of \u01ebu with increasing x is correlated with the decrease of the mean velocity (see Fig. 12), but\nthese changes are not exactly equivalent.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThe theoretical approach described above enables us to account for many experimental results, and to demon-\nstrate that some widely-accepted interpretations are in fact erroneous. It has led us to a somewhat different and,\nwe believe, more realistic perspective. In particular, we conclude that \u2013\n1. The shift in the velocity pulsation power spectra towards the low-frequency domain is caused mainly by the\njet divergence, and not by pairing of vortices. It can therefore be calculated within the linear approximation.\n0.5\n0.55\n0.6\n0.65\n0.7\n0.75\n0.8\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n3 4 5 6 7 8\n<\nu\n>\nx\n1\n2\nFigure 12. Calculated dependences of the mean velocity \u3008u(x, y)\u3009, taking account of the correction caused by the turbulent\npulsations on x for (1) y = 0 and (2) y = 0.7.\n2. The transformation of the mean velocity profile, and the onset of the phase transition, can be found without\nany need to use the concept of turbulent viscosity.\n3. Our quasi-linear theory is valid only for small intensities of the random disturbance (noise); but the noise\nintensity at the nozzle exit needed to maintain the turbulence may, correspondingly, also be very small. For\nlarger intensities, the development of turbulence is from the very outset an essentially nonlinear process.\n4. The change in the variance of the velocity pulsation with distance from the nozzle, like the change in\nthe angular variance with increasing noise intensity in the pendulum with a randomly vibrated suspension\naxis, closely resembles changes in the order parameter with increasing temperature for a second order phase\ntransition. This is the basis for our conjecture that these phenomena can appropriately be considered as\nnoise-induced non-equilibrium phase transitions.\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge useful discussions with G.V.
