Encouraged by a \nprocess of labour market deregulation begun in the 1980s, employers have created jobs \nthat are defined by high levels of employment flexibility, while on the supply-side the \nincreased labour market participation of groups such as women and young people has \nensured that this demand has been met. Although flexible work is being accommodated \non the supply-side, the defining feature of employment flexibility lies in the increased \nscope it provides for employers to adjust the size and structure of their workforces. \nTechnological and organizational change has also played a role in encouraging the growth \nof flexible employment. In particular, it is speculated that the restructuring of production \nprocesses within firms has raised the efficiency costs of institutions that impede \nflexibility, such as centralized bargaining (Lindbeck and Snower, 1996).  \n \nThere is concern however that flexible employment arrangements can themselves raise \nefficiency costs in important ways. Chiefly, the proliferation of casual and temporary \nworking arrangements may lead to reduced employer-led investments in training and a \nsub-optimal level of training provision in the economy (Streeck, 1989; Arulampalam and \nBooth, 1998). Arulampalam and Booth (1998) find that workers employed on flexible \narrangements \u2013 defined in terms of union membership, hours worked and employment \ncontract \u2013 face a decreased likelihood of experiencing work-related training. This \nsuggests that there may be a substantial market failure occurring with respect to the \ntraining of workers employed in the flexible workforce. Employees falling into this group \nacquire fewer skills and less human capital than their counterparts in the permanent \nworkforce.   \n \nTheoretically, the relationship between flexible employment and the provision of \nemployer-funded training hinges on how firms invest in specific and general human \ncapital. The availability of a short-term labour force employed on part-time, fixed-term \n 3\nand \/ or casual contracts means that firms have the option to organise part of their \nproduction around a workforce of temporary workers that can be adjusted at will. After \nOi (1962), the fixity of labour is relaxed such that firms can use labour as a \u201cflexible \nfactor of production\u201d. In this situation firms face a reduced incentive to invest in the \ntraining and retention of a significant workforce of long-term, permanent employees. In \nturn, the pursuit of \u201cflexible production\u201d by firms has the potential to affect a negative \nexternality with respect to the skills, welfare and productivity of the aggregate workforce. \nFor example, Arulampalam and Booth (1998) highlight the tensions that exist between \nenhancing labour market flexibility through the removal of \u201cinstitutional rigidities\u201d that \nimpede the decision-making of firms (ie: unions, employment legislation and government \nregulation) and enhancing flexibility by improving the skills and adaptability of workers.           \n \nRecent evidence on the labour market performance of temporary and fixed-term contract \n(FTC) workers provides some support for the idea that such workers are being used as \nflexible factor inputs. Guell and Petrongolo (2003) conduct an extensive study of \nemployment durations in the Spanish labour market, finding early and late spikes in the \ntiming of FTC worker\u2019s contract renewals. The early spike is consistent with a screening \nexplanation while the later spike reflects the 3-year legal limit on FTC employment. \nNoting that the later spikes are more pronounced for male and less-skilled workers, Guell \nand Petrongolo (2003:17) posit that such spikes could be indicative of employers \u201cusing \nFTCs as a cheaper alternative to permanent contracts up to their legal duration limit of \nthree years\u201d. Other studies by Booth et al (2002) and Brown and Sessions (2003) examine \nwage differentials between permanent workers and those on FTCs. In particular, Brown \nand Sessions (2002) find that the wages of FTC workers in the UK are 13% lower than \ntheir permanent counterparts (even after controlling for personal and job characteristics), \nwith 70% of the difference attributable to price effects, that is, variations in how \npermanent and FTC workers are paid according to their characteristics.  \n \nGiven this evidence on how employers pay and utilize flexible workers it is plausible that \npatterns of training could also have some relationship to the employment status of \n 4\nworkers. Employer funded training could be expected to take a leading role in such a \ntrade-off relationship since it is the most direct manifestation of employers\u2019 human \ncapital investments. Existing research on the pattern of employer funded training has \nconsidered a wide range of factors and focused primarily on measures of incidence, that \nis, the question of who receives employer funded training1. However, the intensity of \ntraining provided by employers to workers in different working arrangements is also \nlikely to be a crucial issue when considering the possibility of the trade-offs discussed \nabove. For instance, casual workers might not be excluded from general and informal \ntraining provided within a workplace, but may be excluded from more intensive training \nwhich is expected to have long-lasting effects on productivity.  \n \nTherefore, it is possible that differences in the incidence of training between different \ngroups of workers may hide even larger differentials in the amount of training provided \nby employers. In turn, information on the intensity of training has the potential to shed \nlight on the extent of underinvestment and market failure in training. For example, in \ncases where members of the flexible workforce do receive employer funded training is \nthis training of a lower intensity? And are there particular groups in the flexible \nworkforce that suffer more acutely from the trade off between training and flexibility?   \n \nThis paper assesses the influence of flexible working arrangements on the provision of \nemployer funded training in Australia. The Australian economy provides a good context \nfor examining the link between flexibility and training since it is an economy \ncharacterized by both a large flexible workforce and a large non-traded goods sector, a \ntrend that has been associated with skill deficits in the workforce2. We use the 1997 \nSurvey of Employment and Training Experience (SETE) conducted by the Australian \nBureau of Statistics (ABS) to investigate the incidence and intensity of employer funded \ntraining. This survey is useful as it was developed in consultation with a range of training \n                                                           \n1\n See, for example, Green (1991), Shields (1998) and Arulampalam and Booth (1998). The papers by Green \nand Zanchi (1997) and Miller (1994) examine the time spent in training in the context of gender \ndifferentials in the receipt of training. \n2\n Oulton (1996) makes a connection between Britain\u2019s skill profile and non-traded goods sector in \ncomparison to the higher skills and exports of the German economy.  \n 5\npolicy bodies and contains very detailed information on the incidence, costs and intensity \nof training undertaken by workers. Our particular interest in the SETE data lies with the \nextent to which casual, part-time and non-unionised workers fail to attract training \ninvestment from their employers. Therefore we are able to extend previous studies (for \ninstance Arulampalam and Booth, 1998) by not only examining training incidence but \nalso training intensity; measured by training duration and the number of courses attended.  \n \nWe find that workers in flexible employment face a substantially diminished probability \nof receiving employer funded training, and that these differences are even more marked \nfor training intensity. In common with other recent studies we find that the gender \ndifferences in the incidence of employer funded training are minimal (Green and Zanchi, \n1997). Male casual workers, for instance, were 19 percent less likely to receive employer \nfunded training than permanent employees, with a corresponding figure of 17 percent for \nfemales. Our findings for training intensity uncover some major gender differences.  \nMales in part-time and casual employment benefit from 14.5 hours less training than their \npermanent counterparts, which is markedly less than the 9 hour disadvantage experienced \nby female workers in part-time and casual employment. Insofar that male flexible \nemployment is mainly determined on the demand-side3, this suggests that males in \nmarginal employment suffer more acutely from the trade-off between training and labour \nmarket flexibility.  \n \nThe remainder of this paper is organized into four sections. The next section discusses \nrecent work on the incidence and structure of nonstandard work, outlining the special \nsignificance of flexible workers in the Australian economy.  Section three provides details \nof the empirical methods used in this paper. Section four contains a discussion of the \nempirical results, whilst section five concludes.  \n \n \n                                                           \n3\n Mangan (2000) provides a classification of the supply-side and demand-side determinants of flexible \nemployment. For example, women are more likely to choose flexible work as a complement to family \n 6\nII DATA SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND \n \nFlexible Work in Australia \n \nBefore continuing, what is meant by flexible employment must be clarified. Generally, \nflexible work refers to jobs that vary from permanent, full-time positions. We focus on \ntwo dimensions of flexible employment, casual employment and part-time work. \nFollowing Arulampalam and Booth (1998) union membership is examined as another \nfactor influencing workforce flexibility, as the presence of union representation has \nimplications for the decision-making autonomy available to a firm4.  \n  \nThe Australian labour market provides a useful setting to examine the possibility of \nexternalities in the relationship between workforce flexibility and training investment. \nHigh levels of casual employment make the Australian experience of flexible work \ndistinctive. Casual employment is a legally recognized employment state in Australia. It \nis the most prevalent form of flexible employment in Australia with the proportion of \ncasual workers in the workforce rising from 19% in 1988 to 26% in 1999 (Mangan and \nWilliams, 1999). Casual employees in Australia do not receive leave entitlements (ABS, \n1996) and are easier to dismiss than permanent workers.  Whilst there is a correlation \nbetween part-time work and casual employment, many casual employees work full-time \nhours. Approximately 32% of casuals in 1998 worked 30 or more hours a week (ABS, \n2001). Also casual employment in Australia has historically been concentrated in highly \nfeminised occupations and industries, although this gender bias has narrowed over time \n(Simpson et al, 1997). As a result, casual employment may be a more stigmatised form of \nemployment for males. Finally, unlike temporary employment contracts in many \nEuropean countries, there are no maximum periods for casual employment in Australia.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                                             \nactivities than men. Furthermore, Booth et al (2002) suggest that flexible working arrangements may act as \na signal of low ability for men.  \n4\n Although it is also possible that, for a number of reasons related to union imposed rules and higher labour \ncosts in unionised firms, unionisation may actually reduce the provision of employer funded training \n(Kennedy et al 1994).  \n 7\nData \n \nSETE was conducted by the ABS in 1997. It covers a sample of 22,704 individuals who \nwere living in a private dwelling and had worked as salary or wage earnings in the past 12 \nmonths. SETE contains a large amount of information regarding training and education \nundertaken in the last twelve months. Furthermore, some of this information is split \naccording to whether the training occurred with the current employer (as at the end of the \nyear) or the main period employer. SETE also contains information on how many jobs a \nrespondent held in the past 12 months. To make sure that training and education episodes \nduring the year relate to the job characteristics for the current employer we restrict our \nsample to those individuals who only held one job in the past twelve months5.  \n \nOur interest here lies with employer provision of training and as a result we restrict the \nsample to those employed at the time of the survey. We further restrict the sample to \nprime-age (25 to 64 year olds) employees, omitting the self-employed and employers.   \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 \n \nTable 1 reports summary statistics for employees in the SETE data.   Notably, 27% of \nwomen and 13% of men are employed in casual jobs. Approximately 24% of all \nemployees are in part-time positions although this figure is inclusive of casual workers. \nThe proportion of individuals not in a union is 60%, although this figure varies \nsubstantially between the private (71%) and public sectors (26%). Women are \nsubstantially more likely to be in casual or part-time employment than men. Finally, \nwomen are more concentrated in the service industry and in clerical and intermediate skill \noccupations.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 \n \n                                                           \n5\n 34 per cent of casual employees and 24 per cent of part-time employees had more than one job in the \ntwelve month period.  \n 8\nInformation on the training experience of workers in the past 12 months is reported in \nTable 2. SETE contains information on all training undertaken by the respondent in the \npast 12 months. However, the most detailed information, such as whether the training was \nemployer funded, was only collected for the four most recent courses. As our focus is on \nemployer funded training it is this information that is used as the basis for our analysis \n(further details on training information in SETE is provided as appendix 1).  Training \ninformation recorded includes on-the-job training and employer funded external and \ninternal training. On-the-job training in the SETE survey consists of mostly informal \ntraining arrangements (i.e. ad hoc on-the-job instruction), as a result we restrict ourselves \nto an analysis of employer funded training6. In SETE, individuals also identify whether \nthe skills \/ knowledge gained from training episodes would be transferable to other \nemployers. We exclude from our analysis training that was identified as being strictly \nnon-transferable. This has only a minor effect on training incidence and intensity figures \n(for instance only approximately 5 per cent of all employer funded training was identified \nas not being transferable), but has the advantage of excluding very specific forms of \nemployer funded training such as induction training that are likely to be offered to all \nemployees within a workplace irrespective of work flexibility. Data presented in Table 3 \nshows that there were minimal differences in the overall incidence of employer funded \ntraining by gender. However, hours in training was higher for males than it was for \nfemales (18.5 hours versus 15.0 hours).     \n \nIn terms of labour market flexibility and training, males in part-time or casual work have \na substantially lower incidence of training than females. This mirrors UK evidence on \nworker flexibility and employer funded training (Arulampalam and Booth, 1998).  Also \nunion membership appears to have a substantial impact on training incidence, especially \nfor women. Table 3 indicates that non-unionised women are 6 per cent less likely to gain \ntraining than women who are in a union. Flexible work appears to have similar effects on \nhours in training and number of courses attended. Most noticeably, the intensity of \n                                                           \n \n6\n This is defined as those training episodes that were identified as being either external and funded by the \nemployer or conducted internally to the firm.  \n 9\ntraining for men in casual work is very low; on average they receive only 5 hours of \ntraining in the year and 0.3 of a training course.    \n \nIII METHOD \n \nIncidence of Employer Funded Training \nIn the absence of separate data on employer supply of and employee demand for training, \nthe incidence of employer funded training is specified as a reduced-form equation: \n \niii xTr \u03b5\u03b2 +\u2032=*         (1) \n \nWhere x is a vector of personal and work-related characteristics, \u03b2 is a vector of \ncoefficients to be estimated, and \u03b5 is the error term. Tri* is the ith individual\u2019s propensity \nto receive training, which is unobservable. Instead we observe a dummy variable  (Tri) \nsuch that  \n \n Tri = 1 if Tri* >0 \n Tri = 0 otherwise. \n \nAs a result (1) is estimated by probit and to aid interpretation the estimates are reported as \nmarginal effects.  \n \n \nIntensity of Employer Funded Training \n 10\nNext we examine training intensity. There are two measures of intensity available in \nSETE, hours in employer funded training and number of employer funded training \ncourses undertaken. Together these provide a comprehensive description of training \nintensity.  We estimate separate models for each of these measures.  \n \nHours in training (Hi ) can be specified as: \n \niii xH \u03b5\u03b2 +\u2032=           (2) \n \nIt is clear though that for those employees who do not undertake training, Hi is left \ncensored. As a result the correct specification is:  \n \niii xH \u03b5\u03b2 +\u2032=  if Hi >0;  \nHi  = 0 otherwise.          \n \nEquation (2) is estimated by Tobit that allows for the left censoring when no training \ncourse was undertaken (Maddala, 1983).  \n \nThe data on number of courses in SETE is a count variable (ci) denoting whether an \nindividual attended 0 through to 4 or more courses during the year.  The simplest \napproach to model count variables is a Poisson model. The Poisson model is based on the \nassumption that the sample variance is equal to the sample mean. In our data though the \nvariance exceeds the mean and the data is said to be overdispersed, and as a result the \n 11\nPoisson model provides inefficient estimates (Long and Freese, 2003). The negative \nbinomial model can overcome this by adding a random error term to the Poisson model \nthat reflects unobserved heterogeneity among individuals: \n \n)exp()( iii xcE \u00b5\u03b2 +=          (3) \n \nIf it is assumed that vi is drawn from a gamma distribution where )exp( iiv \u00b5\u2261 and E(v) = \n1 and \n\u03b1\n\u03c3\n1)( 2 =\u2261vVar  then the following expression for the negative binomial \ndistribution can be derived: \n \n( ) ( )( ) ( )\nic\ni\ni\nii\ni\nii\nc\nc\nc \uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+\u0393+\u0393\n+\u0393\n=\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u00b5\u03b1\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u00b5\n\u03b1\n11\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n,|Pr     (4) \n \nwhere \u0393  is the gamma distribution and the log likelihood function is:  \n \n( ) ( )[ ]\u2211 \u2211\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n=\n\u2212\n\uf8f4\uf8fe\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f1\n+++\u2212\u2212\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+=\nN\ni\niiiii\nc\nj\nXccXcjL\ni\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1 lnexp1lnln(ln \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1   (5) \n \n \n \n \n \n 12\nIV RESULTS \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 \nINSERT TABLE 4 \n \nTable 3 reports marginal effects on the incidence of employer funded training for males \nand females separately (pooling of males and females was rejected at the 1% level).  \nThree variables are used to proxy flexible working arrangements, casual employment, \npart-time work and not a member of a trade union. Of the three, workers in casual \nemployment arrangements appear to face the largest penalty with respect to receiving \nemployer funded training. Casual employees are 19 and 17 percentage points (for males \nand females respectively) less likely to have received employer funded training than those \nin permanent positions.  Part-time workers also face a 10 and 8 percentage point (for \nmales and females respectively) reduced likelihood of receiving training. Finally, not \nbeing a member of a union only significantly impacts on females incidence of employer \nfunded training (7 percentage points). Overall these results suggest that worker flexibility \nhas a substantial negative impact on the incidence of employer funded training.  \n \nTable 4 presents estimates for the two measures of training intensity for males and \nfemales respectively. The coefficient results from the negative binomial regression can be \ninterpreted as a percentage impact on the number of courses attended. Overall, the results \nfor hours in training and number of courses suggest that employees in flexible work \nattract a lower training intensity. From table 4 the impact of flexible work on number of \n 13\ncourses attended is similar for both males and females, although the impact of casual on \nnumber of courses attended appears slightly worse for males. There are, however, marked \ndifferences between males and females with respect to the impact of flexible work on \nhours in training. Male casual employees suffer a much higher penalty in terms of time in \nemployer funded training than females do7. Part-time workers also receive a lower \nintensity of training. That casual employment arrangements do not have as large a \nnegative impact on females may reflect more traditional use of casual working \narrangements in female dominated occupations and industries. More pointedly, casual \nwork may be a particularly marginalized form of employment arrangement for men.  \n  \nNot being a member of a union diminishes the incidence of training for females, but has \nno effect for males. Similarly, it has mixed effects on the intensity of training received. \nWith respect to hours in training, there was no statistically significant difference for \nmales or females between those employees who were union members and those who were \nnot union members. For courses, non-union females received less training courses, for \nmales this effect was at best marginally significant.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 5  \n \nIt must be recognized that these characteristics of flexible work are correlated. Whilst \nsome casual jobs are full-time, the majority are part-time. Workers in casual employment \nare also less likely to be unionised than permanent workers (Mangan, 2000). As a result, \n                                                           \n7\n The casual coefficients between males and females are significantly different at the 5 per cent level in both \n 14\nfor many individuals in the work force these training penalties will be cumulative (i.e. \nmale part-time casuals are 29 per cent less likely to receive training than male full-time \npermanent workers). 8 To further illustrate this table 5 provides some predicted training \nprobabilities for all three training outcomes. These results further emphasize the large \nimpact of flexible work on employer funded training for men. For instance, whilst male \nand female training incidences are similar, men who work in employment that has \nmultiple dimensions of flexibility have a training incidence that is between 6 to 9 \npercentage points lower than women in similar types of flexible work. A similar pattern is \nevident for number of courses. More strikingly, males have an overall advantage in terms \nof hours in employer funded training (of around 1.5 hours), but men in flexible working \narrangements receive 1.5 to 4 hours less training than women in similar arrangements.9  \n \nA further issue is that tenure and training may be jointly determined. As a result, the \ninclusion of tenure as an independent variable in training models may lead to biased \nestimates. To investigate this models of incidence and intensity were estimated with \ntenure excluded. This had only a minor impact on covariate estimates, although the casual \nemployment estimate for male training incidence and the hours of training did increase to \n\u201321% and \u201316 hours, respectively (from \u201316% and \u201313 hours), indicating some bias in \nthe original estimates.  \n                                                                                                                                                                             \nthe number of courses and duration in training models.  \n8\n We evaluated whether there is any additional training penalty for belonging to more than one of these \ncategories of flexible work by including three multiplicative terms (casual and not in a union, part-time and \nnot in a union, part-time and casual) in a training incidence regression. However these terms were not \nstatistically significant at standard levels. \n9\n Male and female differences in intensity of training were significant at the 5 per cent level for the casual \nemployment categories (i.e. casual and part-time, casual and not in a union, and casual part-time and not in \na union).  \n 15\n \nEstimates of the impact of other personal and work characteristics on training incidence \nlargely follow those found in existing UK and Australian research (Green, 1991; Miller, \n1994; Arulampalam and Booth, 1998; Shields, 1998). Younger employees, those with \nhigher qualification levels, and those in higher skilled occupations were more likely to \ngain training. Only the results for tenure are dissimilar to previous studies. Unlike the \ngenerally inverse relationship between tenure and training incidence in existing research \nwe find a less clear cut relationship. Both males and females who have been in the job for \nover a year have an advantage over short-term workers (the omitted case less than a year \nof tenure). Training incidence rises with tenure for males, but in a sporadic fashion. There \nare no significant differences in the impact of tenure for females between 1 and 15 years, \nand the coefficient for greater than 15 years tenure is smaller and only significant at the \n10 per cent level. Public sector employees and those in larger establishments face a \nsubstantially higher incidence of training. \n \nLess research has been conducted on the intensity of training, so some discussion on the \nimpact of other personal and work characteristics on training intensity is warranted.  \nGenerally, training intensity appears to increase with occupational skill level and size of \nfirm, and decrease with age. Public sector employees gain more training, while those \nfrom a Non-English Speaking Background suffer a large penalty to training intensity. \nSimilar to the results for incidence, training intensity appears to increase with tenure for \nmen.  For females, there is an advantage in terms of courses attended of having tenure of \ngreater than one year (the omitted category), but no significant pattern otherwise.   \n 16\n \nA few points can be made about these results. First, highly educated employees are \nclearly at an advantage in attracting employer funded training. This is in line with other \nresearch that indicates there are substantial complementarities between education and \ntraining (Lillard and Tan, 1992, Bartel, 1995 and Hill, 2001).  The relationship between \ntenure and training found in this study is distinct from that illustrated in studies of the UK \nand US.  Tenure was positively related to training incidence and intensity for males, \nwhilst there was no clear relationship for females. An earlier Australian study, Miller \n(1994), found no relationship between tenure and \u2018structured training\u2019 (internal training \nand external training) for either males or females. Whilst in another Australian study \nKennedy et al (1994) found that tenure and employer funded training were positively \nrelated, and suggested that this may be due to training being used as a reward for \nseniority.  Our estimates indicate that males with over 15 years or more tenure in the firm \ngain the most training (in terms of both incidence and intensity) of all male employees. \nThis appears to support the seniority-reward explanation of training provision. To the \nextent that male flexible workers have shorter tenure, this would present a further \ndisadvantage to male flexible workers in terms of gaining access to employer funded \ntraining. Together, these results suggests that the influence of tenure on employer funded \ntraining may not be as clear-cut in Australia as it is in the UK and US.  \n \n \nV CONCLUSION \n \n 17\nIn this paper we have focused on one dimension of the trade off between training and \nlabour market flexibility, namely the way in which employer funded training varies with \nemployment flexibility. As the most direct manifestation of employer\u2019s human capital \ninvestments, this type of training is more likely to reflect the production decisions of \nfirms and therefore the impact on training of firms using labour as a \u201cflexible factor of \nproduction\u201d.  Previous research on the training-flexibility trade off (Arulampalam and \nBooth, 1998) has focused on work-related training generally rather than any particular \ntypes of externality. Therefore, by examining a specific dimension of work-related \ntraining this study provides three insights into the relationship between training and \nlabour market flexibility.   \n \nFirstly, we find that evidence of a trade-off is apparent in the intensity as well as the \nincidence of training. Our examination of the intensity of training revealed large penalties \nfor those in flexible working arrangements. This indicates that when firms do invest in \nflexible workers they seem to invest at a much lower rate. For instance, based on \npredicted training outcomes, male casual part-time workers receive 14.5 hours less \nemployer funded training than that received by the male workforce generally. Female \ncasual part-time workers fare better, receiving 9 hours less training than the overall \nfemale workforce. More intuitively, these predicted outcomes indicate that the employer-\nfunded training received by flexible workers is 50-80% less intense than the workforce \naverage. \n \n 18\nSecondly, our study finds that casual employment \u2013 a uniquely flexible form of \nemployment that is prevalent in the Australian economy - has a sizeable effect on the \nincidence and intensity of employer funded training. These effects exceed those found for \nalternative indicators of flexibility such as part-time work and non-union coverage.   \n    \nFinally, it appears that males in casual working arrangements face a greater penalty in \nterms of the intensity of employer-funded training than females in similar arrangements. \nMales in casual employment receive 13.3 hours less training in the year than those in \npermanent employment (the corresponding figure for females is 8.7 hours). The impact of \ncasual work on number of training courses attended is also larger for males. \n  \nOverall, this suggests that males in casual employment may suffer more acutely from the \nnegative aspects of the trade-off between training and labour market flexibility. Arguably, \nthis can be attributed to the contrasting demand and supply-side determinants of flexible \nwork. That is, males are less likely to deliberately choose casual employment as part of \ntheir labour supply decisions. This suggests that males who find themselves in casual \nworking arrangements may face serious impediments to human capital formation.   \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors thank Steve Bradley and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Was the course in-house (as opposed to external)?  \n2. If the course was external, did the employer either provide financial support for \nthe course? \n3. Was the individual a wage or salary earner at the time of the course?; \n4. Were the skills transferable?  \n \nIf for any of the last four courses the respondent answered yes to either question 1 or 2, \nand yes also to questions 3 and 4 then this training course was considered employer-\nfunded for the purpose of our analysis. In terms of our training variables, if an individual \nreporting any employer-funded training episodes during the year (subject to the \nconditions above), Tri =1, 0 otherwise. Number of employer funded training courses (ci) \nis simply a count of courses the individual undertook that conform to the requirements \nlisted above. Hours in training (Hi) is the sum of hours for each identified employer \nfunded training course.
