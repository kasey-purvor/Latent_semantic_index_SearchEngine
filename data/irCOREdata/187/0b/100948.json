It has also\nbecome increasingly more important that water com-\npanies are seen by customers to be setting a good\nexample by fixing leaks as soon as possible, especially in\ntimes of drought.\nIt has been estimated by Ofwat that .30% of the total\nleakage from the water distribution system in the UK is\nassociated with service pipes.1 A service pipe runs from\nthe water main to a user, via an outside stop valve\n(OSV), and comprises a supply pipe and a communica-\ntion pipe (Fig. 1). The communication pipe runs from\nthe water main to the OSV, located near the boundary of\nthe user, and the supply pipe runs from the OSV into the\nproperty.\nCommunication pipes, which are the responsibility of\nthe water company, have been manufactured from a\nnumber of materials including lead, iron and more\nrecently plastics. Although new lead pipes have not been\ninstalled since the early 1970s, it is estimated that there\nare y1.4 million lead communication pipes still in\noperation within the Thames Water Network alone.2\nThis accounts for y60% of the total number of\ncommunication pipes within the Thames Water\nNetwork; the total associated length of lead pipe is\ny8000 km.\nThese lead pipes are known to fracture in service.\nHowever the causes of these failures do not appear to be\nwell understood and consequently there is no \u2018off the\nshelf\u2019 method of condition assessment for lead based\nassets, of the sort that was developed for cast iron pipes\nin the early 1980s. Lead alloys are complex materials\nwith mechanical properties that depend strongly on\ncomposition and microstructure; moreover, they are\nsusceptible to damage under service conditions involving\ncreep and fatigue loading (in pipes perhaps arising from\nground loading and thermal effects) and corrosion.\nThere is also a distinct lack of contemporary research\ninto the behaviour of lead alloys, with much of the work\nconfined to the early half of the twentieth century.\nWork in the field indicates that a significant number\nof repairs are carried out on leaking lead service pipes,\nbut the mechanisms that cause these failures are not\nfully understood. Certain types of failure may also be\nmore detrimental than others and their different\ncontributions to leakage are unknown. Pipes are\nreplaced either as part of the water main renewal\n1Thames Water Utilities Ltd, Research and Development, Spencer House,\nManor Farm Road, Reading RG2 0JN, UK\n2School of Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH,\nUK\n*Corresponding author, email neil.starling@thameswater.co.uk\n600\n\u0001 2007 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining\nPublished by Maney on behalf of the Institute\nReceived 22 June 2006; accepted 27 June 2006\nDOI 10.1179\/174328407X157326 Materials Science and Technology 2007 VOL 23 NO 5\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) IO\nM \nCo\nmm\nun\nica\ntio\nns\n Lt\nd\nprogrammes or as leakage is detected. The present work\nis part of a study designed to develop a better under-\nstanding of the failure of lead pipes in service and so to\ndevelop a condition assessment tool that could facilitate\na more targeted replacement strategy.\nThe structure of the present paper is as follows. We\nbegin by reviewing, briefly, the manufacturing methods\nused for the production of lead pipes as these have a\nrole in the development of the microstructure and the\nintroduction of defects, which is relevant in under-\nstanding failure mechanisms. The set of lead pipes\navailable for the current work is then presented. These\nwere sourced from the ground, where some had\nexperienced failure in service. The failure mechanisms\nare summarised. The preparation of metallographic\nsections from these pipes sourced from the ground is\nthen described, followed by microstructural observa-\ntions, which are linked to the available literature. This\nenables factors contributing to the pipe failures to be\nidentified and conclusions to be drawn.\nManufacturing methods\nLead pipes were manufactured by a process of extrusion\nas covered by the British Standards, BS602 (1935) and\nBS1085 (1943), which were subsequently amalgamated\nto form BS602:1085 (1956) \u2013 \u2018Specifications for lead and\nlead alloy pipes for other than chemical purposes\u2019.\nDuring an extrusion operation, lead is formed into a\ncontinuous length of uniform pipe by forcing the lead to\nflow under high pressure and temperature through a die\naperture. The process was commonly carried out in a\nvertical hydraulic press, using a method of inverted\nextrusion. In inverted extrusion the normal practice is\nthat the die is attached to the head of the press frame\nand the charge container moves over the die, pushing the\ncharge though it, as shown in Fig. 2. After the 1950s, a\nmethod of horizontal continuous extrusion began to be\nused more widely.\nFor the extrusion process shown in Fig. 2, it is\nnecessary to replace the charge after each successive\nmotion of the charge container. In the case of\ncontinuous extrusion, however, the lead is forced\nthrough the die by means of an extrusion screw in one\ncontinuous operation, thus avoiding the difficulties\nencountered with intermittent charging. As will be\ndiscussed later in the present paper, whether the pipe\nis manufactured by a method of vertical hydraulic\nextrusion or continuous extrusion will affect the grain\nsize and shape along with introducing other micro-\nstructural characteristics\/defects into the pipe.\nPipes examined in present work\nIn total more than 60 lead pipes were sourced from the\nThames Water region. The pipes are typically y23 mm\noutside diameter with a bore ofy12.5 mm. The samples\nwere obtained through the Customer Side Leakage\nteams and thus were targeted as contributing to leakage\nin one form or another. The sample set comprised both\nintact lead pipes and pipes which had failed in service,\nalthough it was not possible in all cases to obtain that\nsection of the pipe that contained the failure.\nOf those pipes obtained which had a failure (as\napparent from visual inspection or from pressurisation\nof the extracted pipe section), different failure types can\nbe classified. TheWRc plc employs a classification system\nthat enables failed pipes to be assigned to one of seven\ncategories.3 This classification system has been applied to\nthe failed lead pipes in the present work in Fig. 3. Of these\nfailure modes, the longitudinal split and circumferential\nbreak are self-explanatory. Some differentiation needs to\nbe made between a corrosion pit and a hole. A corrosion\npit will be present on pipe that exhibits visible signs of\ncorrosion whereas a hole may be present on an otherwise\nsound pipe and may possibly indicate mechanical\ndamage. A pinhole leak is such that it may not be visible\nuntil a low pressure test is carried out. A \u2018deformation\u2019\nfailure is, as the name suggests, where the pipe has been\ncrushed or deformed, either as a result of its installation\nor possibly owing to ground loading. An \u2018interface\u2019\nfailure is where a leak is apparent at the interface between\nthe pipe and another asset such as polyethylene pipe or\nOSV. Any one pipe may contain a number of different\nfailures. It can be seen from the graph that the most\nfrequently occurring failures are longitudinal and trans-\nverse (or circumferential) fractures.\n2 Schematic illustration of inverted extrusion process\n3 Distribution of defect types in failed lead pipe samples\n1 Schematic of service pipe, showing communication\nand supply elements\nStarling et al.

This means that it is vital\nthat any unnecessary deformation, excessive friction or\nheating is avoided in the metallographic preparation of\nlead. If extensive recrystallisation occurs during sample\npreparation then this may lead to the formation of a\nsurface microstructure that is not representative of the\nunderlying microstructure of the lead under examina-\ntion. This is one factor which makes the preparation of\nlead for metallographic examination inherently difficult.\nA number of preparation methods have been cited\nwithin the literature.4\u20137\nThe first and most important step in preparation of\nthe lead metallographic sample is sectioning the sample\nfrom the parent supply pipe. This must be achieved with\nas little deformation and heating of the lead as possible.\nSlepian and Blann4 and Hofmann5 describe a method\nwhereby a fine hacksaw or fret saw is employed, with a\nnew blade used for each sample. This avoids additional\nmaterial becoming embedded in the lead with each\nsuccessive sample. This method provided the level of\naccuracy needed with minimal deformation and heat\ngeneration within the lead, and was the method adopted\nin the present work.\nOnce samples were sectioned, the cut face was ground\nby hand using 320 grit silicon carbide paper to ensure\nthat it was plane; during this process a constant flow of\ncold water was run over the sample to minimise heating\nand to assist in the removal of particulates that may\nbecome embedded. The samples were then mounted\nusing Struers Epofix Resin. The cure of this resin is non-\nexothermic and so no additional heating of the sample\noccurs.\nOnce the samples had cured in the mounting resin the\nnext stage was to grind the face to be examined. Slepian\nand Blann4 suggest three grinding stages using 320, 400\nand 600 grit silicon carbide papers, whereas Ednie6\nsuggests using up to 1200 and 4000 grit to minimise the\nnumber of embedded particles from the paper and to\nremove any surface scratches from both the cutting and\nprevious grinding stages. In practice, a combination of\nthese two methods was employed, whereby a grinding\nmethod consisting of five stages was utilised, using 320,\n500, 1200, 2400 and 4000 grit silicon carbide paper (on a\nStruers Planapol grinding machine). Both Slepian and\nBlann3 and Ednie5 suggest a grinding force of y100 N.\nTrials suggested that this was too high, however, and the\nforce was reduced to 60 N to minimise deformation of\nthe lead. Time limits for each successive grinding stage\nwere not predetermined and each stage was continued\nuntil evidence of the previous grinding stage was\nremoved.\nFinal polishing of the sample was carried out using 3\nand 1 mm diamond abrasives followed by a 0.25 mm\nalumina abrasive. Even after extensive polishing, a\nnumber of fine scratches were sometimes still evident\non the surface of the lead; these can arise from\nsomething as simple as washing the surface of the lead\nwith cotton wool, which serves to highlight its friable\nnature. Before etching, it was also possible to observe\nsmall amounts of surface deformation to the lead and a\nnumber of embedded silicon carbide particles entrapped\nduring the grinding operations. In order to remove these\nimperfections and remove any recrystallised layer\nproduced from the grinding and polishing an aggressive\netchant is needed.\nThere are in excess of 25 alternative etchants for lead\ncited within the literature, and their use depends on the\ncomposition of the lead and the required result.\nASTM#114 suggests an etchant that consists of three\nparts acetic acid, four parts nitric acid and 16 parts\nwater. The etchant is applied by immersion of the\nsample for 25\u201340 min, or until the grain structure is\nvisible with the naked eye. It was felt that this etchant\nwas sufficient to remove the recrystallised layer on the\nsurface of the lead and produce high grain definition.\nOnce etching was complete the sample was washed with\na stream of methanol and air dried.\nThe polished samples were examined using a Zeiss\nAxiophot light microscope with image capture using a\nZeiss Axiocam and Zeiss Axiovision image processing\nsoftware. As indicated earlier, more than 60 lead pipe\nsamples have been examined during the course of the\nstudy. In the next section, representative examples are\nused to show the range of microstructures encountered.\nParticular features of interest are the grain size and grain\nsize distribution shown by the samples, together with\nany characteristic defects. From this, it is possible to\ncomment upon how these may influence the failure\nmodes seen in practice.\nPipe microstructures: observations and\ndiscussion\nGrain size and size distribution\nThe grain size was found to vary significantly. Figure 4\nshows a number of partial cross-sections from pipes with\na range of microstructures; one section exhibits the\n4 Variation in grain size observed in lead pipe samples\nStarling et al. Characterisation of lead pipes used in the water industry\n602 Materials Science and Technology 2007 VOL 23 NO 5\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) IO\nM \nCo\nmm\nun\nica\ntio\nns\n Lt\nd\n\u2018desirable medium grain size\u2019 (y0.5 mm) specified by\nthe British Standard, while the others exhibit the\nextremes of coarse and fine grain sizes that were seen.\nIt is apparent from the literature that the grain size\ncan influence, significantly, the mechanical properties of\nlead. With regard to the influence of grain size on the\ntensile strength of lead, Garre and Muller7 found that\nthe tensile strength of lead increases with decreasing\ngrain size, as for most metals, owing to the grain\nboundaries acting as a barrier to plastic deformation.\nTurning to the long term properties, the rate of creep\nin lead varies depending on the grain size. Hanffstengal\nand Hanemann8 showed that at low stresses\n(y0.5 MPa) and temperatures, fine grained lead (grain\nsize d of 0.2 mm) creeps more quickly than coarse\ngrained lead (d57 mm). The same trend, of decreasing\ncreep rate (or creep strain after a given time under stress)\nwith increasing grain size was reported by other work-\ners.9,10 In long term tests at higher stresses (y2 MPa),\nhowever, there was a tendency for recrystallisation and\ngrain growth to occur within the lead, thereby decreas-\ning its resistance to creep.8\nHopkin and Thwaites9 also carried out extensive\nexperiments to investigate the effect of grain size on the\nfatigue strength of lead. They used an alloy with 0.85%\nantimony, which meant that the lead alloy was not\nsubject to recrystallisation during the tests. The grain\nsize of the lead was controlled by varying the extrusion\ntemperature. From fatigue tests carried out at a\nfrequency of 50 Hz, they showed that as the grain size\nincreased, the fatigue strength decreased, although the\neffect was fairly small. These tests are consistent with\nwork carried out by Gohn and Ellis11 who conducted\ntests to simulate the influence of daily temperature\nfluctuations on lead cable sheaths by applying stress to\nthe material at a frequency of a single stress cycle each\nday. They showed that in various lead\u2013tin alloys the\nfatigue strength increased with decreasing grain size, but\nagain only to small extent.\nIn order to strike a balance between good creep\nresistance, good fatigue resistance and tensile strength,\nthe British Standard specifies that under metallographic\nexamination, lead pipes should exhibit a uniform\nmicrostructure with a \u2018desirable medium grain struc-\nture\u2019. This equates to a grain size ofy0.5 mm. Many of\nthe samples examined in the present work do not show\nsuch a mean grain size. Furthermore, many of the pipe\nsections exhibited what is cited commonly as a \u2018zoned\u2019\ngrain structure. This is characterised by circumferen-\ntially opposed areas of fine and coarse grains. This\nzoned structure is a product of bending and coiling of\nthe lead pipes upon leaving the extrusion press, which\nsubsequently results in recrystallisation and grain\ngrowth within the pipe.12,13 A typical zoned structure\nis shown in Fig. 5. The regions of coarse grains are\nclearly visible in the upper and lower quadrants of the\nsection; with a visible transition from \u2018fine\u2019 to \u2018coarse\u2019\ngrains.\nButler14 found that in creep tests under internal\npressure, those pipes that exhibit a zoned structure\nshowed non-uniform expansion owing to the differing\nrates of creep between fine and coarse grain lead. He\nalso showed that in fatigue tests there was a tendency for\ncracks to propagate at the boundary between the coarse\ngrained and fine grained regions. This can be attributed\nto the presence of stress concentrations at the transition\nzone. Butler noted that the fatigue strength of a lead\npipe with a zoned structure is less than that of a pipe\nwith uniform structure whether it is fine or coarse. In\npractice quenching the pipe as it leaves the extrusion\npress can prevent zoning.\nPresence and role of defects\nMany pipes exhibit defects as a result of the extrusion\nprocess. One such defect is when the pipe has a \u2018scarf\u2019\njoint running longitudinally. This appears as a ring of\noxidised material, when the pipe is cut transversely. This\noxide layer is introduced during the extrusion process as\nthe charge is replaced. As the slug from one operation is\nleft in the container, a layer of oxide is formed on the\nsurface. A new charge is then placed in the container on\ntop of the oxide layer and the extrusion process\ncontinues. This layer of oxide is then dragged through\nthe length of the pipe as the extrusion process takes\nplace. Figure 6 shows a transverse section from a failed\n5 Lead pipe sample exhibiting \u2018zoned\u2019 grain structure\n6 Failed lead pipe showing oxide ring and associated\ncavities\nStarling et al. Characterisation of lead pipes used in the water industry\nMaterials Science and Technology 2007 VOL 23 NO 5 603\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) IO\nM \nCo\nmm\nun\nica\ntio\nns\n Lt\nd\nlead service pipe and the oxide ring is apparent. There\nare weak metal\/oxide interfaces associated with the\noxide layer and associated with the interface is the\noccurrence of cavities, which result in a local reduction\nin cross-section. The lead pipe on either side of the oxide\nrings may show different characteristic grain sizes with\nassociated problems as highlighted earlier.\nOther problems can also arise from the process of\nreplacing the charge in the press during the extrusion\nprocess. Owing to a number of factors such as friction\nalong the walls of the container and the internal surfaces\nof the die block, along with higher temperatures at the\ncentre of the charge, movement towards the die block is\nfastest in the middle. This results in the lead from the\nnew charge protruding in to the lead from the old charge\ninside the forming chamber. This phenomenon exhibits\nitself in the microstructure in the form of \u2018metal\ntongues\u2019. These metal tongues ultimately meet, to form\nweld seams at two circumferentially opposed areas of\nthe pipe. This is illustrated in Fig. 7, by the ring of fine\ngrains. In very extreme cases, for example if the ring is\nvery close to the surface of the pipe, this can cause\nblistering of the surface owing to an insufficient weld\nbetween the charges.\nIt should be noted that oxide layers are not introduced\nto the same extent when a method of continuous\nextrusion is utilised, as there is no need to stop the\npress to replace the charge. Hence the defects described\nabove are not generally seen in continuously extruded\npipes.\nAnother defect that arises as a direct result of the\nextrusion process is particular to those presses which\nutilise a bridge die. In such a set-up, the mandrel bar is\nconnected to the die by spider arms, which can range in\nnumber from one to four. This can cause problems\nbecause the radial welds, which are formed as the lead\nreunites after the extruded section has passed the spider\narms, are often of an imperfect nature. This is\nexacerbated if oxide and dross contained in the charge\nare drawn out behind the arms on extrusion, as this will\ncertainly inhibit the formation of a strong weld between\nthe two joining parts. In extreme cases the use of a\nbridge die may lead to the formation of longitudinal\nsplits from the sites of the joins. A transverse section\nillustrating poorly formed welds is shown in Fig. 8.\nMany of the defects seen in the extrusion process are\noften ascribed to the extrusion temperature being too\nlow. This prevents the oxide and dross in the melt from\nrising to the surface of the charge and so promotes the\nformation of internal defects. It has been noted already\nthat many of the microstructural defects associated with\nthe extrusion process can be avoided by using a method\nof continuous extrusion. It was also observed by\nMcKeown and Hopkins14 that the grains in lead pipes\nextruded on the continuous press were uniform in size\nand structure, while those produced on the hydraulic\npress produced a grain structure that was more irregular\nin size and structure. Therefore it would seem that those\npipes produced on a continuous extrusion press would\ntend to exhibit a more desirable grain structure as well as\ncontaining fewer defects.\nConclusions\nThe issue of controlling leakage within the water\ndistribution network is one of great importance and in\norder to control one aspect of this leakage, a better\nunderstanding of the failure modes in lead service pipes is\nvaluable. As a contribution towards this aim, the micro-\nstructure of lead service pipes, the majority sourced from\nthe Thames Water Network, has been examined. It has\nbeen shown that the observed microstructures differ\nsignificantly from pipe to pipe, exhibiting grain size\nvariation (or zoning) and a number of defects (oxide rings\nand improperly formed internal welds), directly attribu-\ntable to the manufacturing process.\nThe defects identified from the microstructural study\ncertainly play a major role in the occurrence of long-\nitudinal and circumferential failure in service. It has been\nshown that the microstructural defects of both zoning and\nradial welds can lead to the formation of longitudinal\n7 Defects resulting from change in charge in extrusion\npress\n8 Lead pipe sample with longitudinal splits resulting\nfrom improper welds at spider arms\nStarling et al.

In the case of zoned microstructure, stress concen-\ntrations arise at the interface between fine and coarse\ngrained regions, which may lead to failure. In the case of\npoor radial welds, the inherent weakness in the weld can\nlead to the propagation of large longitudinal cracks. The\nprevalence of such manufacturing defects within the\nsamples may lead to complications in formulating an\neffective method of condition assessment as accurate\nrecords of pipe manufacture and date are not available.\nThe literature also suggests that the large majority of\ncircumferential failures seen in service can be attributed\nto fatigue failure.15\u201317 This is an aspect that may be\ninvestigated further within the present work.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support of Mike\nParker in the School of Engineering, University of Surrey,\nfor his advice and assistance with regard to the prepara-\ntion and examination of the metallographic samples.\nReferences\n1.
