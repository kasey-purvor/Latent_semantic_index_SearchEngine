INTRODUCTION \nENOISING is to reduce noise levels while the signal \ndegradation is minimized. As noise is found in \neverywhere and usually corrupted with signals, denoising is \nimportant and useful in many engineering applications. \nAmong the existing denoising algorithms, wavelet \ndenoising algorithms (Thresholding is applied on the \nwavelet coefficients.) are the most common approaches for \ndenoising because wavelets exploit both the time and the \nfrequency domain information of signals and hence wavelet \ndenoising approaches can achieve good performances. In \nthe past, many researches studied the effects of various \nthresholding functions on the denoising performances. \nNowadays, soft thresholding wavelet denoising methods [8, \n9] are well understood and widely applied to images and \nECG signals. Further extension from soft thresholding \nwavelet denoising approaches to a fuzzy thresholding \nwavelet denoising approach [7] was also proposed. \nAlthough scalar wavelets are widely employed for signal \nprocessing, it is difficult for scalar wavelets to achieve \northogonality, symmetry, short support and high vanishing \nmoments simultaneously. Multiwavelets were proposed \nrecently [1, 2, 3], and it was found that multiwavelets could \nachieve all the above four properties simultaneously. Owing \nto these advantages, various thresholding functions for \nmultiwavelet denoising approaches were proposed [4, 5, 6]. \nAlthough multiwavelet denoising techniques have \nalready been proved to be efficient for signal denoising, the \neffects of various multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters on \n \n \ndenoising performances are unknown. Hence, methods for \nselecting multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters are unknown. \nThe aim of this paper is to suggest a method to integrate \ndifferent multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters together to \nobtain suboptimal results for ECG signal denoising. Since \ntwo types of Chui Lian (CL) multiwavelets [2, p.289, p.295] \nand Qingtnag Jiang (QJ) multiwavelet [3] are the most \ncommon multiwavelets used for signal processing, these \nthree multiwavelets are chosen for the investigation. \nBesides, thirty five commonly used pre- and post-filters are \nalso selected for the investigation. In this paper, ECG \nsignals are assumed to be corrupted by additive white \nGaussian noises (AWGN). A hard thresholding is applied \non the multiwavelet coefficients. The fuzzy rules are \nestablished based on the following methods: A set of input \noutput pairs of the denoising performances using different \nmultiwavelets, pre- and post-filters at different noise levels \nare obtained, where the denoising performances are \ncalculated based on the mean square error (MSE) criterion. \nWe fixed a number of fuzzy rules, and design the fuzzy \nmembership functions based on the input output pairs \nobtained from the numerical computer simulations. Once \nthe fuzzy rules are designed, a new ECG signal can be \ndenoised based on these fuzzy rules. \nThe outline of this paper is as follows: Section II and \nSection III will review some basic multiwavelet theories and \nfuzzy mechanisms, respectively. Our proposed fuzzy rule \nbased denoising algorithm is discussed in Section IV. \nNumerical computer simulation results are shown in \nSection V. Finally a conclusion is drawn in Section VI. \nII.

In the \nimplementation, the multiwavelet is implemented via pre-\nfiltering the input signal, passing the pre-filtered signal to a \nvector valued filter bank with the impulse response of the \nanalysis and the synthesis filters being characterized by nH  \nand nG , respectively, and then post-filtering the signal to \nreconstruct the original signal. \nIII. FUZZY MECHANISMS \nFuzzy logic is a mathematical formalism that attempts to \nimitate the way humans make decisions. Through the \nconcept of the fuzzy grade membership, fuzzy set theory \nand fuzzy logic allow a simple mathematical expression to \ncapture expert knowledge to a system [11], [12]. \nIn our fuzzy system, all fuzzy membership functions are \ndefined as trapezoidal fuzzy membership functions. \nTrapezoidal fuzzy membership functions are convex, \nnormal, compact, and easy to implement. An example of a \ntrapezoidal fuzzy membership function is shown in Figure \n1. \n \nDenote n  as the dimension of the input vector, \nj\njk\njj AAA ,...,, 21  for nj ,,1\uf04c\uf03d  as the fuzzy sets for the input \njx , and mBBB ,...,, 21  as the fuzzy sets for the output z .

OUR PROPOSED FUZZY MULTIWAVELET DENOISING \nSYSTEM \nOur proposed fuzzy multiwavelet denoising system \ncomprises with six blocks as shown in Figure 2. The ECG \nsignals used in the investigation are from the Beth Israel \nDeaconess Medical Center at Boston [10]. They are \ncontaminated by additive white Gaussian noises with zero \nmean and variances 2\uf073 , which can be estimated using \nexisting adaptive signal processing techniques. \n \nThe original signal ks  is first added with noise. Then the \nsignal is pre-filtered by a filter with filter response Q . After \nthat, a multiwavelet transform is applied. The pre-filter is \nused to map the data ks  into multiple streams because \nmultiwavelet transform requires the input data having \nmultiple streams. A threshold level nt  developed by Donoho \n[9] as follows \n \nntn log2\uf073\uf03d  (12) \n \nis employed. The denoised signal is\u02c6  is then inverse \nmultiwavelet transformed. The final block of data is then \npost-filtered by a filter with the filter response P  to obtain \na denoised signal. The set of pre-filters and post-filters has \nto satisfy IPQ \uf03d , where I  is the identity filter response, \nthat is: \n \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf03d\n10\n01\nI . (13) \n \nIn order to measure the denoising performance, MSE is \nused as the criterion, that is \n \n2\n1\n0\n)](\u02c6)([1MSE nsns\nN\nN\nn\n\uf02d\uf0e5\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n, (14) \n \nwhere N   is the total signal length. \nThe fuzzy systems determine the best combination of \nmultiwavelets, pre- and post-filters for minimizing the MSE \nof the reconstructed signal. The knowledge on the effects of \nemploying different multiwavelets, pre- and post-filters at \ndifferent noise levels on denoising performances is obtained \nbased on training which is discussed in the next section. \nV. NUMERICAL COMPUTER SIMULATION RESULTS \nIn order to demonstrate the effects of employing different \nmultiwavelets, pre- and post-filters on the denoising \nperformances, numerical computer simulations were \nperformed to recover a signal with 1000 samples embedded \nin the zero mean additive white Gaussian noises with \nvarious noise powers. The original ECG signal is shown in \nFigure 3. \n \nBy employing different combinations of the three \nmultiwavelets and the thirty five pre- and post-filters listed \nin Table 1, the percentage improvements of the MSE of the \nreconstructed signals for each combination are obtained. \nTable 2 lists the multiwavelet, pre- and post-filters that give \nthe best denoising performances when the ECG signal is \ncorrupted at different noise powers.

The linguistic terms divide each \npartition of multiwavelets and pre- and post- filters into \nthree segments. The segments for multiwavelets are Kernel \nLow (KL), Kernel Medium (KM) and Kernel Big (KB), \nwhile that for the pre- and post-filters are Filter Low (FL), \nFilter Medium (FM) and Filter Big (FB). \n \n \nFigure 8 shows the average percentage improvement of \nthe MSE of the denoising signals using the fuzzy and the \nnonfuzzy approaches. The nonfuzzy approach is performed \nby applying the univariate soft thresholding to GHM \nmultiwavelet coefficients [5]. Comparing the results of these \ntwo methods, the fuzzy approach outperforms the nonfuzzy \napproach by more than 20% for all noise powers. \nTABLE II \nSETS OF FUZZY RULES FOR DENOISING ECG SIGNALS. \nRules Kernels \nIF 058.0030.0 \uf0a3\uf0a3 \uf073 then use CL2 or QJ \nIF 076.0052.0 \uf0a3\uf0a3\uf073 then use CL2 \nIF 100.0069.0 \uf0a3\uf0a3\uf073 then use QJ \nRules Filters \nIF 040.0030.0 \uf0a3\uf0a3\uf073 then use Symlets 2 \nIF 080.0032.0 \uf0a3\uf0a3\uf073 then use Biorthogonal 3.3 \nIF 100.0074.0 \uf0a3\uf0a3\uf073 then use Biorthogonal 3.1 \n \nTABLE I \nMULTIWAVELETS, PRE- AND POST- FILTERS. \n Name \nChiu Lian [2, p.289, p.295] Multiwavelet \nKernels Qingtang Jiang [3] \nSymlets 2 to 8 \nCoiflets 1 to 5 \nDaubenchies 1 to 8 \nPre- and post-\nfilters \nBiorthogonal \n1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.2, \n2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 3.1, \n3.3, 3.5, 3.7, 3.9, \n4.4, 5.5 and 6.8 \n \n0\n1\n0 .0 3 0 0 .0 4 0 0 .0 50 0 .0 6 0 0 .0 70 0 .0 8 0 0 .0 9 0 0 .10 0  \nFig. 7.
