We have utilised the near-global imaging capabil-\nities of the Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN radars, to per-\nform a statistical superposed epoch analysis of high-latitude\nplasma flows during magnetospheric substorms. The study\ninvolved 67 substorms, identified using the IMAGE FUV\nspace-borne auroral imager. A substorm co-ordinate system\nwas developed, centred on the magnetic local time and mag-\nnetic latitude of substorm onset determined from the auro-\nral images. The plasma flow vectors from all 67 intervals\nwere combined, creating global statistical plasma flow pat-\nterns and backscatter occurrence statistics during the sub-\nstorm growth and expansion phases. The commencement of\nthe substorm growth phase was clearly observed in the radar\ndata 18\u201320 min before substorm onset, with an increase in\nthe anti-sunward component of the plasma velocity flowing\nacross dawn sector of the polar cap and a peak in the dawn-\nto-dusk transpolar voltage. Nightside backscatter moved to\nlower latitudes as the growth phase progressed. At substorm\nonset a flow suppression region was observed on the night-\nside, with fast flows surrounding the suppressed flow region.\nThe dawn-to-dusk transpolar voltage increased from\u223c40 kV\njust before substorm onset to\u223c75 kV 12 min after onset. The\nlow-latitude return flow started to increase at substorm onset\nand continued to increase until 8 min after onset. The ve-\nlocity flowing across the polar-cap peaked 12\u201314 min after\nonset. This increase in the flux of the polar cap and the ex-\ncitation of large-scale plasma flow occurred even though the\nIMF Bz component was increasing (becoming less negative)\nduring most of this time. This study is the first to statistically\nprove that nightside reconnection creates magnetic flux and\nexcites high-latitude plasma flow in a similar way to day-\nside reconnection and that dayside and nightside reconnec-\ntion, are two separate time-dependent processes.\nKey words.

Provan\n(gp3@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe two-cell convection pattern observed in the high-latitude\nionosphere was initially explained by Dungey\u2019s (1961) re-\nconnection cycle. Dungey (1961) stated that during peri-\nods of southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), recon-\nnection at the dayside magnetopause would lead to the cre-\nation of open magnetic flux in the Earth\u2019s polar cap. This\nopen magnetic flux would convect over the poles and then\nbe closed by reconnection processes on the nightside in the\nmagnetotail. This circulation of magnetic flux was origi-\nnally assumed to be a steady-state phenomenon, with the\nrate of creation and destruction of open flux being equal at\nany one instance of time. Russell (1972) sketched the iono-\nspheric flows resulting from a non-steady substorm cycle;\nreconnection on the dayside and in the tail became viewed\nas two separate time-dependent processes, resulting in non-\nsteady plasma flow in the high-latitude ionosphere (Russell\nand McPherron, 1973; Siscoe and Huang, 1985; Lockwood\net al., 1990, Cowley and Lockwood, 1992).\nFreeman and Southwood (1988) discussed the flows gen-\nerated by the localized addition of flux to the dayside po-\nlar cap, and the subsequent reconfiguration of the polar cap\nboundary. Both reconnection at the dayside magnetopause\nand in the tail generates ionospheric convection. Figure 1a\n(after Lockwood et al., 1990, Lockwood, 1991) describes\nsteady-state flow driven by balanced dayside and nightside\nreconnection. The solid-line corresponds to the open\/closed\nfield line boundary and the dashed line to the dayside or\nnightside merging gap, that is the ionospheric projection of\nthe reconnection line. 8D corresponds to the potential across\nthe dayside merging gap, 8N to the potential across the\nnightside merging gap and 8pc to the cross polar-cap po-\ntential. Reconnection on either the dayside or the nightside\ninfluences convection at all locations within the polar cap\nand auroral ovals (Lockwood, 1991). Figure 1b shows the\nconvection pattern generated by reconnection at the magne-\ntopause alone. Purely dayside reconnection leads to the cre-\nation of open flux, and the subsequent expansion of the polar\ncap. The flows are expected to be strongest on the dayside,\nwith the foci of the twin-vortex flow being located at either\n3608 G.

Figure 1c shows the same\nfor unbalanced nightside reconnection alone, as suggested\nby the expanding-contracting polar-cap (ECPC) model pro-\nposed by Siscoe and Huang (1985). Nightside reconnec-\ntion results in the destruction of open flux, and the subse-\nquent contraction of the polar cap. The flow during intervals\ndominated by nightside reconnection will be strongest on the\nnightside, with the foci of the twin-vortex located at either\nend of the nightside merging gap.\nMagnetospheric substorms are characterised by the build-\nup and subsequent destruction of magnetic flux on the night-\nside of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. They are generally ob-\nserved during, or just after, intervals of southward IMF. Dur-\ning the substorm growth phase, open flux produced by day-\nside reconnection is transported to the nightside by the solar\nwind, so that the magnetic flux in the tail lobes increases.\nThis growth phase typically lasts 20 to 50 min, before the tail\nbecomes unstable and the substorm expansion phase is be-\ngun with rapid nightside reconnection occurring within the\nnear-Earth plasma sheet (Cowley et al., 2002). The substorm\nexpansion phase is characterised by a sudden brightening of\nthe nightside aurora within the region called the \u201csubstorm\nauroral bulge\u201d. Within the substorm auroral bulge there ex-\nists large westward directed currents, driven by the very large\nconductivities created in the bulge ionosphere by the precip-\nitating electrons. The electric field within this auroral bulge\nis found to be strongly suppressed (e.g. Morelli et al., 1995;\nYeoman et al., 2000a,b; Khan et al., 2001; Cowley et al.,\n2002).\nEven today we do not fully understand the mecha-\nnisms which trigger the onset of the substorm expansion\nphase, and controversy still surrounds how the high-latitude\nplasma flows are affected by magnetospheric substorms.\nOpgenoorth and Pellinen (1998) observed abrupt enhance-\nments in ionospheric flows in response to substorm onset.\nThey suggested that suppression of flow within the substorm\ncurrent wedge (mapping essentially to the substorm auroral\nbulge) would result in an enhancement in the velocity of the\nionospheric flows which were deflected around this region.\nHowever, such an enhancement of the deflected flow would\nnot affect the overall transpolar voltage (Grocott et al., 2002).\nGrocott et al. (2002) using the SuperDARN HF radars have\ndemonstrated the excitation of large-scale flow associated\nwith the substorm expansion phase of a small high-latitude\nsubstorm. The excited flow pattern was of a twin-vortex\nform with foci located at either end of the subsorm auroral\nbulge. The transpolar voltage associated with the flow in-\ncreased from \u223c40 kV prior to onset, to a peak of \u223c80 kV\nafter 15 min, decreasing to \u223c35 kV over \u223c10 min in the sub-\nstorm recovery phase.\nThere is at present a lack of knowledge concerning the av-\nerage statistical flow patterns associated with different sub-\nstorm phases, in contrast to the variety of statistical patterns\nof flow associated with different IMF orientations (e.g. Hep-\npner and Maynard, 1987; Weimer 1995; Ruohoniemi and\nGreenwald, 1996). In this paper we aim to perform a sta-\ntistical study investigating the high-latitude plasma flow in\nthe interval 30 min before, until 30 min after substorm ex-\npansion phase onset. For this we use data from the Northern\nHemisphere SuperDARN radars, the wide fields-of-view and\nan extensive number of these radars, making them excellent\ninstruments for the investigation of spatial and temporal de-\nvelopments of global plasma flow. The substorm expansion\nphase onset is identified using optical measurements from the\nIMAGE FUV (far ultra-violet) imager. The IMAGE FUV in-\nstruments consists of several cameras. Here, the Wideband\nImaging Camera (WIC) has been used to image the large\nscale aurora in the Northern Hemisphere.\nG. Provan et al.: Statistical study of high-latitude plasma flow 3609\nFig. 2. The fields-of-view of the Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN\nradars.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe ionospheric convection velocities presented in detail in\nthis study are provided by the Northern Hemisphere Super-\nDARN radars, part of the international SuperDARN chain of\nHF radars (Greenwald et al., 1995). At present there are 9\nSuperDARN radars imaging the high-latitude convection in\nthe Northern Hemisphere, their fields-of-view are presented\nin Fig. 2. All the data presented in this statistical study were\nrecorded in the year 2000 and the first half of 2001. The\nKing Salmon radar (labelled C in Fig. 2) did not become op-\nerational until late 2001 and so no data from this radar have\nbeen included in this study. Each radar of the system is a fre-\nquency agile (8\u201320 MHz) radar, routinely measuring the line-\nof-sight (l-o-s) Doppler velocity of echoes from ionospheric\nplasma irregularities. The radars each form 16 beams of az-\nimuthal separation 3.24\u25e6. Each beam is gated into 75 range\nbins. In standard operation (normal resolution) mode each\ngate has a length of 45 km and the dwell time for each beam\nis 7 s, giving a full 16 beam scan, covering 52\u25e6 in azimuth\nand over 3000 km in range (an area of over 4\u00d7106 km2), ev-\nery 2 minutes.\nThe Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Explo-\nration (IMAGE) mission is dedicated to imaging the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere (Gibson et al., 2000). The Far Ultraviolet\nCamera Wideband Imaging Camera (WIC) provides global\nmaps of the terrestrial aurora, in the spectral region from\n140\u2013190 nm. The WIC is mounted on the rotating IMAGE\nspacecraft viewing radially outward and has a field-of-view\nof 17\u25e6 in the direction parallel to the spacecraft spin axis\n(Mende et al., 2000).\n(a)  23 June 2000, 13:01 UT.

(2003) utilised the IMAGE FUV instrument to\nstudy the aurora in broad band using the WIC camera. They\nidentified the onset time and the location (MLAT and MLT)\nof 113 substorms in 2000 and 2001, by a sudden brightening\nof the WIC images. Figure 3 presents WIC data from one\nof the substorm intervals identified by Mende et al. (2003),\non 23 June 2000; this interval was included in the follow-\ning statistical study. The figure presents data from 13:01 to\n13:22 UT, where the auroral oval is clearly visible in all the\nplots. Substorm onset was identified at 13:07 UT. The plots\nclearly show an increase in auroral activity between 13:01\nand 13:07 UT, with the signature of the onset of the substorm\nexpansion phase.\nOne hundred and thirteen substorm intervals were iden-\ntified from the IMAGE FUV, with all the intervals in the\nyears 2000 or 2001. During 67 of the intervals, the Su-\nperDARN radars were running in normal-resolution com-\nmon time mode (2-min resolution). For these 67 substorms\nwe studied the l-o-s velocity measurements made by all the\nNorthern Hemisphere SuperDARN radars, studying plasma\nflow from 30 min before substorm onset, until 30 min af-\nterwards. We aimed to perform a spatial superposed-epoch\nanalysis of plasma flows during the substorm growth and ex-\npansion phases. Initially, we mapped the l-o-s velocities ob-\nserved by all the Northern Hemisphere radars during each\nsubstorm interval into the global grid defined by the map-\n3610 G.

Gridded line-of-sight velocity data from the SuperDARN\nradars for 23 June 2000 at 13:06 UT.\npotential analysis technique (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998).\nThis global grid has grid cells which are 1\u25e6 in lat (\u223c111 km\nprojected onto the Earth\u2019s surface), and as close to 111 km\nin longitude as possible. This gridding system has the ad-\nvantage that it nearly equalizes cell areas, while the more\nconventional choice of a grid, defined by fixed steps in lat-\nitude and longitude, has the disadvantage of a severe latitu-\ndinal variation in cell area. Figure 4 presents an example of\nthe gridded l-o-s velocity data for one of the days included\nin the statistical study, on 23 June 2000, at 13:06 UT. The\ndata are presented in a magnetic local time-magnetic latitude\nco-ordinate system in the Northern Hemisphere, with local\nmidnight positioned at the bottom of each panel. During this\ninterval there were data from all eight Northern Hemisphere\nSuperDARN radars available to us, except the Kodiak radar\n(radar A in Fig. 2).\nNext, a substorm co-ordinate system was defined and each\nsubstorm interval was transformed in accordance with this\nco-ordinate system. The co-ordinate system defined points\nin terms of MLT and MLAT, where point (0,0) was the MLT\nand MLAT of the substorm onset, determined from the IM-\nAGE FUV data. For ease of data presentation the point (0,0)\nis chosen to be at a MLAT of 65\u25e6 and a MLT of midnight in\nthe following figures. This position was chosen since 71%\nof the substorm onsets identified in the FUV data occurred\nwithin 90 min of midnight, and the average latitude of sub-\nstorm onset was 65\u25e6. We note that as 65\u25e6 is close to the\nequatorward edge of the SuperDARN field-of-view (in nor-\nmal scan mode), the substorm-affected region may only be\npartially imaged by the radars.\nThe actual co-ordinate transformation is best explained by\nan example. For the first substorm interval, on 23 June 2000,\nthe onset of the substorm expansion phase was identified at\n13:07:17 UT, at a MLT of 23:00 and a MLAT of 69\u25e6. Our\nfirst step involved gridding all the l-o-s velocity data for the\nperiod 12:37 to 13:37 UT, to the global grid described earlier.\nAs the data has two-minute resolution, this represents 30 time\nsamples. Next, for each of these 30 time samples, the loca-\ntions of all vectors were rotated in local time in accordance\nwith the substorm co-ordinate system, with both the origin\nand the end point of the vectors being rotated. Thus, a vector\npreviously positioned at 23:00 MLT, would be repositioned\nat 24:00 MLT. This is described by the below formula:\n\u03d5\u2032 = \u03d5 + \u03b1 (1)\nWhere \u03d5 is the original longitude of the vectors\u2019 start or end\npoints, \u03d5\u2032 is the new longitude of the flow vector and \u03b1 is the\nangle of rotation. For this substorm \u03b1 would be 15\u25e6, equal to\nthe angle of rotation needed to rotate the position of substorm\nonset to local midnight.\nNext, for all 30 time samples the entire convection pattern\nwould be stretched so that all points at 69:00 MLAT would\nbe moved to 65.0 MLAT. All other points would be stretched\nin latitude by a factor that increased linearly, with increas-\ning latitudinal separation from 90\u25e6. This is defined by the\nformula below:\n\u00f8\u2032 = \u00f8((90\u2212 65)\/(90\u2212 \u03b4s)) (2)\nwhere \u00f8 is the co-latitude of the flow vector, \u00f8\u2032 is the trans-\nformed co-latitude of the vector, and \u03b4s is the latitude of sub-\nstorm onset at substorm onset, equal to 69\u25e6 for the this sub-\nstorm.\nThis method of stretching the convection pattern was de-\nvised as a method of creating a global substorm co-ordinate\nsystem that would most closely maintain the original shape\nof the polar cap. Hereafter, all latitudes and local times will\nbe referred to in relation to this substorm co-ordinate system.\nWe transformed all 67 substorm intervals into the sub-\nstorm co-ordinate system. We then combined the flow vec-\ntors from all of these substorms, considering each of the 30\ntime samples in turn. The 67 substorms together contained\nbetween 20 000 and 30 000 flow vectors at each of the 30\ntime samples. For each of the 30 time samples the l-o-s ve-\nlocities were combined using a cosine fitting technique to\nfind the best-fit flow vector. Originally, we intended to per-\nform the cosine fitting to the l-o-s velocities at each grid\npoint. However, we realised that this resulted in such a large\nnumber of vectors that it was difficult to present them visu-\nally. Instead, the cosine fitting technique was performed on\nall the l-o-s velocities observed within an area that covered 1\ngrid point in latitude (1 deg), and 2 grid points in longitude\n(approx. 220 km). Such cosine fitting was only performed\nif there was a minimum of five l-o-s velocity measurements\nwithin this area. Figure 5 presents an example of this cosine\nfitting technique, presenting the angle and velocity of the l-\no-s velocities observed in the area extending from 70\u25e6 to 71\u25e6\nin latitude and from 0\u25e6 to 6\u25e6 in longitude, 30 min before sub-\nstorm onset. Overplotted is a dashed line showing the l-o-s\nG.

The overplotted dashed line shows the cosine variation of the best-fit velocity.\nvelocity versus l-o-s angle for the best-fit flow vector. The\nvelocity was calculated according to the formula below:\nV = Vbestcos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1best), (3)\nwhere Vbest is the velocity of the best-fit flow, \u03b1best is the\nangle of the best-fit flow, V is the l-o-s velocity component\nand \u03b1 is the magnetic azimuthal angle.\nThe end result is 30 convection maps of best-fit flow vec-\ntors representing the Northern Hemisphere global convection\npattern every two minutes from 30 min before substorm on-\nset until 30 min afterwards. These maps were used as a basis\nto perform a detailed statistical study of high-latitude con-\nvection during the substorm growth and expansion phases.\nWe were also able to determine estimates of cross polar-cap\npotential.\n4 Results\n4.1 IMF conditions\nBefore discussing the flows we present the upstream IMF\nconditions for the substorm intervals, from the ACE space-\ncraft, to demonstrate the average background conditions. For\neach interval we calculated a delay between the time of the\nsolar wind observation at ACE and the time it impinged at\nthe dayside magnetopause, using the algorithm of Lester et\nal. (1993). The average IMF conditions (GSM) for all 67\nsubstorm intervals are presented in Fig. 6. The plot shows\nthat, on average the IMF Bx component is slightly positive,\nwhile the average IMF By and Bz components are negative.\nFrom five minutes before substorm onset until onset itself\nthe magnitude of the IMF Bz component decreases (becomes\nless negative), increasing by \u223c1.5 nT.\n4.2 Flow vectors\nFigure 7 presents the cosine-fitted vectors at 10-min steps\nfrom 30 min prior to substorm onset (Fig. 7a) until substorm\nonset (Fig. 7d). Each plot includes data for a two-minute\nsample (the resolution of the radar data). The vectors are\npresented in what we term the substorm MLT\/MLAT co-\nordinate system described earlier, where the onset location\nis marked by a black cross on the plot. The velocity magni-\ntude is represented both by the length of the vector and by its\ncolour, with blue representing the strongest flow and yellow\nthe weakest. In Fig. 7a the flow presented is a two-cell con-\nvection pattern, with plasma flowing away from the Sun and\nacross the polar cap at higher latitudes and returning at lower\nlatitudes. Flows out of the polar cap on the nightside appear\nrelatively weak. There is an asymmetry in the strength of\nthe low-latitude sunward return flow, with stronger flows ob-\nserved in the pre-midnight time sector compared to the post-\nmidnight sector.\nFigure 7b presents the cosine-fitted vectors 20 min before\nsubstorm onset. The high-latitude plasma flow into the po-\nlar cap on the dayside has now become stronger and more\nstructured. There is still a dawn-dusk asymmetry in the\nstrength of the sunward flow at lower latitude. The flows\nacross the polar cap are also stronger than 10 min previously.\nFigure 7c presents the flow vectors 10 min before substorm\nonset. Strong flows into the polar cap are now observed be-\ntween \u223c08:00 and \u223c14:00 MLT. Compared to the flow vec-\ntors observed 30 min before substorm onset, the equatorward\nboundary of radar backscatter at midnight has moved from\na latitude of 61\u25e6 to 59\u25e6, the poleward boundary of midnight\nbackscatter has also moved equatorward to a latitude of 82\u25e6,\nfrom 84\u25e6 30 min before onset.\n3612 G.

At\nthe dayside the magnitude of the flow into the polar cap\nappears to have decreased compared to the flow observed\n10 min before substorm onset, while the magnitude of the\nhigh-latitude plasma flowing out of the polar cap at the night-\nside has increased. There is an asymmetry in the strength\nof the nightside high-latitude plasma flowing out of the po-\nlar cap, with stronger flows observed in the pre-midnight re-\ngion compared to the post-midnight region. The strength of\nthe low-latitude return flow observed between \u223c19:00 and\n\u223c21:00 MLT has increased considerably. Between the MLTs\nof 21:00 and 24:00 we observe high velocity plasma flows\nout of the polar cap, travelling to lower latitudes. At a lati-\ntude of\u223c70\u25e6 between 22:30 and 24:00 MLT, these fast flows\nappear to be stalled and diverted, travelling to lower latitudes\nat MLTs earlier than 22:30 and later than 24:00. Thus, there\nis evidence of a suppressed flow region on the nightside, cov-\nering an area from approx 62\u25e6 to 70\u25e6 latitude and from 22:30\nto 24:00 MLT, with fast flows diverted round its edges.\nFigure 8 presents the flow vectors 4 min after substorm on-\nset until 28 minutes after substorm onset. In Fig. 8a there\nare strong high-latitude flows out of the polar cap on the\nnightside. The nightside suppressed flow region observed at\nsubstorm onset is now more clearly defined, with enhanced\nplasma flow now being diverted to latitudes of 59\u25e6 to 62\u25e6,\nwhich is below this region of suppressed flow. There ap-\npears to be stronger anti-sunward flows in the high-latitude\ndusk region as compared with the dawn region. The strong\nlow-latitude return flow pre-midnight of the auroral onset re-\ngion continues, with particularly strong flows observed in the\npost-dusk sector. Figure 8b presents the flow vectors 14 min\nafter substorm onset. The flow pattern is very similar to the\nflow pattern observed 4 min after substorm onset. The sup-\npressed flow region is still clearly observable, although the\nstrong flows at lower latitudes are somewhat reduced. In\norder to guide the eye, a dotted black circle marks the ap-\nproximate position of this region. Figure 8c presents the\nflow vectors observed 20 min after substorm onset. There\nis still strong plasma flow leaving the polar cap on the night-\nside, although this flow appears much less structured than the\nflow observed 14 min after the substorm onset. The night-\nside suppressed flow region appears to be further extended,\nstretching from approx. 60\u25e6 to 70\u25e6 MLAT, and from \u223c22:00\nto 02:30 MLT, with enhanced plasma flow being diverted\naround this region.\nFigure 8d presents the flow vectors observed 28 min after\nsubstorm onset. The ionospheric flows are now much less\nstructured than the flows observed 20 min after substorm on-\nset, but there is still strong plasma flow directed both into and\nout of the polar cap.\n4.3 Backscatter occurrence\nFigure 9 presents radar backscatter occurrence during the\nsubstorm growth phase, from 30 min before substorm onset\n(Fig. 9a) until substorm onset (Fig 9d), at intervals of 10 min.\nThe plots shows how many Doppler velocity measurements\nhave been used in the cosine fit to derive each vector in the\nflow plots.

The flow reversal boundary was\nconsidered a proxy for the polar cap boundary. The first step\nwas to measure the width of the polar cap across the dawn-\ndusk meridian, measured from the position of flow reversal\nin the dawn sector to the position of flow reversal in the dusk\nsector. This measurement was taken as a proxy for the width\nof the polar cap. We then calculated the mean anti-sunward\nvelocity across the dawn-dusk meridian, and also separately\nG.

This velocity was derived\nby averaging all cosine-fitted vectors along the dawn-dusk\nmeridian for each time sector. As each cosine-fitted vector\nis derived from a number of vectors itself, the mean velocity\nwas weighted by the number of l-o-s velocities used to esti-\nmate each cosine-fitted vector. So, for the example presented\nin Fig. 5, this cosine-fitted velocity would have a weight of\n34.

At\neach time sample we performed a student t-test in order to\ninvestigate whether the difference in the weighted mean be-\ntween the dawn and the dusk sectors was significant at the\n95% confidence level.

Dur-\ning the growth-phase the total polar-cap velocity reaches a\nminimum 14 min before substorm onset. The polar-cap ve-\nlocity reaches a maximum 12\u201314 min after substorm onset,\nafter which the velocity starts to decrease, before increasing\nagain 22 min after onset.\nG.

Provan et al.: Statistical study of high-latitude plasma flow\n4.5 Determining the cross polar-cap potential\nThe dawn-to-dusk cross polar-cap potential (8 pc) is de-\nscribed by:\n8pc =\n\u222b\nV\u22a5Bdl, (4)\nwhere V\u22a5 is the anti-sunward component of the plasma flow\nat a given point along the dawn-dusk meridian, dl is the\nwidth along the dawn-dusk meridian over which the mea-\nsurement is made and B is the polar magnetic field.\nAs in Sect. 4.4 the dawn-to-dusk flow reversal bound-\nary is taken as a proxy for the polar cap boundary. For\neach time sample the anti-sunward component of the cosine-\nfitted velocity at each grid point is multiplied by the length\nof the dawn-to-dusk polar boundary along which it is ob-\nserved. This is done all the way along the polar cap bound-\nary and the individual potentials are then summed to create\nthe cross polar-cap potential. Figure 12 presents the cross\npolar cap potential, from 30 min before substorm onset until\n30 min after. The cross polar cap potential is not an abso-\nlute value, as no attempt has been made to compensate for\nthe stretching\/shrinking of the convection pattern performed\nwhen transforming the substorm convection patterns into the\nsubstorm co-ordinate system. However, as each substorm\nwas stretched by the same amount over the entire time inter-\nval of the substorm, the value of the cross polar cap potential\npresented represents the relative change of the cross polar-\ncap potential during the substorm. The average cross polar-\ncap potential is 53\u00b19 kV. The error bars presented on the\ngraph is the standard deviation of the cross polar-cap poten-\ntial. Although there are rather large fluctuations in the dawn-\nto-dusk potential, some general trends can be observed. Dur-\ning the substorm growth phase the dawn-to-dusk transpolar\nvoltage is at a maximum of 72 kV 20 min before substorm\nonset. Just before substorm onset the transpolar voltage is\n\u223c40 kV. The voltage reaches a maximum of 74 kV 12 min\nafter onset.\n4.6 Low-latitude velocity and potential\nWe determined the weighted mean of low-latitude return flow\nfrom the equatorward edge of the polar-cap boundary to the\nequatorward limit of the radar field-of-view across the dawn\nand dusk sectors, using the same method used to derive the\nmean high-latitude velocities described in Sect. 4.4. The\nmean was weighted by the number of points used to derive\nthe cosine-fitted velocities. The velocities are presented in\nFig. 13. Points that are different at a 95% confidence level\nare marked by an \u201cx\u201d. At almost all times the dusk velocity\nis significantly larger than the dawn velocity.\nWe calculated the low-latitude potential from the equa-\ntorward edge of the polar cap boundary and to the edge of\nthe convection pattern. This potential was calculated in the\nsame way as we calculated the cross polar cap potential in\nSect. 4.5. The results are presented in Fig. 14. The average\nlow-latitude potential is 36\u00b17 kV, with the standard deviation\npresented as error bars in Fig. 14. The average low-latitude\npotential is much smaller than the average cross polar-cap\npotential. We would expect the two to be the same. We\nbelieve that this discrepancy is probably due to the edge of\nthe convection pattern being equatorward of the equatorward\nedge of the SuperDARN field-of-view, causing the apparent\nsaturation of the low-latitude potential at around 40\u201350 kV.\nThere is a large difference in the low-latitude potentials ob-\nserved in the dawn and dusk sectors, with the potentials ob-\nserved in the dusk sector considerably larger than the poten-\ntial observed in the dawn sector. This is due to the much\nlarger velocities observed at low-latitude in the dusk sector\nas compared with the dawn sector. The velocities presented\nin Fig. 11 show that there is a general trend toward larger\nvelocities in the dusk sector than in the dawn sector also at\nhigher latitude, although this difference is much more pro-\nnounced at lower latitudes.\n5 Discussion\nIn this study we have performed a statistical superposed\nepoch analysis of the flow during the growth and expansion\nphases of magnetospheric substorms, analysing the plasma\nflow from 30 min before substorm onset until 30 min after\nsubstorm onset for 67 substorms. No attempt has been made\nto identify the onset of the substorm recovery phase, although\nas the typical length of the substorm expansion phase is of\nthe order of 30 to 60 min (Lui, 1991), we can assume that the\nmajority of the substorms will not have progressed into the\nrecovery phase during the intervals selected for this study.\nGlobal grids of the cosine-fitted flow vectors are presented.\nDuring the substorm growth phase, strong flow was observed\nflowing into the polar cap on the dayside, and as the growth\nphase progressed, the strengths of these flow increased, such\nthat they could be observed over a wider range of local times.\nAs early as 20 min before substorm onset dayside plasma\nflows in the midday region were observed to become more\nstructured and directed more towards the polar cap. During\nthe growth phase the dawn-to-dusk transpolar voltage peaked\n20 min before substorm onset, illustrating increased plasma\nflux flowing across the polar cap. The anti-sunward compo-\nnent of the plasma velocity flowing across the dawn sector\nof the polar cap peaked 18 min before onset. As the growth\nphase progressed, the equatorward and poleward boundaries\nof the nightside radar backscatter moved to lower latitudes.\nThe equatorward motion of HF backscatter during the sub-\nstorm growth phase has been reported by Lewis et al. (1997),\nand has since been observed by a number of authors (e.g.\nYeoman et al., 1999, 2000a; Provan et al., 2002; Milan et\nal., 2003). Such systematic equatorward motion of radar\nbackscatter is believed to correspond to an equatorward mo-\ntion of the structured precipitation of the expanding auroral\noval. This expansion is a result of unbalanced dayside recon-\nnection adding open flux to the polar cap during the growth\nphase, causing the poleward and equatorward edges of the\npolar cap to move to lower latitudes (McPherron, 1970).\nG.

Provan et al.: Statistical study of high-latitude plasma flow\nFollowing substorm onset there is a reduction of night-\nside radar backscatter. As the expansion phase evolves so\ntoo does this depletion in nightside backscatter. Many stud-\nies have reported a lack of nightside HF radar data following\nexpansion phase onset, due to the absorption of radio waves\nin the ionosphere (e.g. Lewis et al; 1997, Yeoman and Lu\u00a8hr,\n1997; Lester, 2000) by the precipitating auroral electrons.\nOur statistical study demonstrates that this depletion in night-\nside backscatter occurs almost immediately following sub-\nstorm onset, and that it further develops during the substorm\nexpansion phase, eventually affecting a sizeable part of the\nnightside ionosphere. Previous studies by, for example, Mi-\nlan et al., 1996 and Milan et al., 1999, have discussed the\ndisruption of HF propagation during substorm onset.\nDuring the expansion phase a region of suppressed flow\nis observed, initially covering a region from 22:30 to\n24:00 MLT, and from \u223c62\u25e6 to \u223c70\u25e6 MLT. Fast flows ap-\npear to be deflected around this suppressed flow region, in\nsuch a manner that the basic two-cell convection pattern was\npreserved. Previous workers have also observed regions of\nnightside flow suppression when studying the ionospheric\nresponse to a substorm expansion phase, for example, Yeo-\nman et al. (2000a), Fox et al. (2001), Khan et al. (2001)\nand Grocott et al. (2002). It is likely that this suppressed\nflow region is related to the increased auroral and magnetic\nactivity previously reported during the substorm expansion\nphase. For example, Khan et al., 2001, presented case studies\nof two complete \u201cclassic\u201d substorm cycles where enhanced\nauroral brightening and increased magnetic activity was re-\nported to be observed over a similar MLT\/MLAT range and\non a similar time scale as the suppressed flow region re-\nported here. They also reported that ionospheric flows within\nthe substorm auroral bulge became semi-stagnant through-\nout the expansion phase. The surrounding flow generally\nremained vigorous and deflected around the semi-stagnant\nregion. They believed such flow stagnation to be due to\nthe high electrical conductivity of the bulge ionosphere com-\npared with the surrounding region.\nOpgenoorth and Pellinen (1998) observed an abrupt en-\nhancement in ionospheric flows in response to substorm on-\nset. They suggested that extreme dipolarisation of a magne-\ntospheric segment inside the substorm current wedge would\nresult in a suppression of flow in this region, and the de-\nflection and relative enhancement of the flow around this re-\ngion. However, this deflection and resultant flow enhance-\nment would not change the overall transpolar voltage. In\nFig. 12 we present the dawn-to-dusk cross polar-cap poten-\ntial. The transpolar voltage is \u223c40 kV just before substorm\nonset and increases to 74 kV 12 min after onset. This is\ndespite the average IMF Bz component becoming increas-\ningly less negative from \u223c5 min before substorm onset until\n\u223c4 min after substorm onset. Such enhancement in the to-\ntal transpolar flux associated with substorm onset was pre-\nviously observed by Grocott et al. (2002) while studying an\nisolated substorms. The transpolar voltages derived by Gro-\ncott and co-workers (2002) are very similar to the voltage\nmagnitudes presented here. Our detailed statistical study\nclearly proves that nightside reconnection during substorm\nonset results in enhanced flux being driven across the polar\ncap.\nIn order to quantify the strength of the plasma flow across\nthe polar-cap, and within the return flow, we presented\nthe mean anti-sunward flow component across the polar-\ncap (Fig. 11) and across the low-latitude return flow region\n(Fig. 13). Figure 11 demonstrates that during the substorm\ngrowth phase the flow across the polar-cap is at a minimum\n14 min before substorm onset, reaching a maximum 12 min\nafter substorm. Figure 13 demonstrates that the magnitude of\nthe return flow starts to increase at substorm onset and con-\ntinues until 8 min after substorm onset. Using the Student\u2019s\nt-test we found that the variation in the return flow velocity\nobserved at these two times was significant at the 95% confi-\ndence level. Flow excitation during larger substorms has also\npreviously been reported by Sandholt et al. (2002).\nIt is thus clear that nightside reconnection occurring dur-\ning the substorm expansion phase resulted in the excitation of\nnew voltage and large-scale flow within the polar cap. This\nhas previously been suggested by Lockwood et al. (1990) and\nCowley and Lockwood (1992), although, to our knowledge,\nthe results presented here are the first to prove this on a sta-\ntistical basis. We are not stating that the increase in plasma\nflow around the nightside suppressed flow region cannot also\nexcite plasma flow, but the large increase in the transpolar\nvoltage during the expansion phase onset would suggest that\nthe main driver behind the excitation of large-scale plasma\nflow is nightside reconnection.\nStudying the dawn-to-dusk transpolar voltage (Fig. 12)\nillustrates that between 6 min prior to substorm onset and\n2 min prior to substorm onset the cross polar-cap potential\ndecreases by approx. 20 kV. This would suggest that there is\na decrease of plasma flow across the polar-cap immediately\nprior to substorm onset. The high-latitude plasma flows pre-\nsented in Fig. 11 also indicate a decrease in the plasma veloc-\nity across the polar-cap between 2 min before substorm onset\nand 2 min after substorm onset. However, the large error bars\nassociated with these velocities mean that this difference in\nvelocity cannot be judged to be significant. A detailed anal-\nysis of the transpolar voltage and high-latitude plasma flows\nassociated with the few minutes immediately prior to and af-\nter substorm onset will be an area of further research.\nFigure 11 also presents the mean velocity across the dawn\nand dusk sectors of the polar cap. Although there are only\n9 times during the substorm growth and expansion phases\nwhere there is a significant difference between the dawn and\ndusk velocities, at all these times the dusk velocities are sig-\nnificantly larger than the dawn velocities. Figure 13 shows\nthat in the low-latitude return flow the dusk return flow is\nalmost always larger than the dawn return flow. So there ap-\npears to be a general trend that the dusk velocity is larger\nthan the dawn velocity, especially at lower latitudes. We\nwondered whether this difference in the velocity between the\ndawn and dusk sectors could be due to the radars moving\nwith the rotation of the Earth. In the return flow it would re-\nsult in faster velocities being observed in the dusk than dawn\nG. Provan et al.: Statistical study of high-latitude plasma flow 3621\nsectors, because the radars would be moving anti-sunward\nwith the rotation of the Earth while the flows are moving\nsunward. This affect would be more pronounced at lower lat-\nitudes. We calculated that at a latitude of 70\u25e6 the dusk sector\nflows should be 300 ms\u22121 faster than the flows observed in\nthe dawn sectors. We then found that the averaged sunward\nvelocity component for all time sections at a latitude of 70\u25e6\nwas 454 ms\u22121 in dusk sector and 165 ms\u22121 in dawn sector, a\ndifference of almost 300 ms\u22121. Thus, we can conclude that\nthe difference in the velocities in the return flow between the\ndawn and dusk sectors is due to the rotation of the Earth.\nThe rotation of the Earth can explain the increase in mag-\nnitude in the dusk sector return flow as compared with the\ndawn flow. However, it does not explain why we sometimes\nobserved higher velocity in the high-latitude anti-sunward\nflow in the dusk sector than in the dawn sector. While the\nrotation of the Earth will have less affect on the flow magni-\ntudes observed at higher latitudes, the affect should be to re-\nduce the magnitude of the anti-sunward flow in the dusk sec-\ntor compared with the dawn sector, as both the plasma and\nthe radars are moving in the same direction with respect to\nthe Earth. Later in this section we will present data proving\nthat the asymmetry in the high-latitude velocities between\nthe dawn and dusk sectors is due to the prevailing IMF con-\nditions.\nFigure 14 presents the low-latitude potential within the re-\nturn flow region from equatorward of the polar-cap boundary\nto the edge of the radar field-of-view. Comparing Fig. 14\nwith Fig. 12 it is noted that the average voltage across the\nlow-latitude return flow region is significantly smaller than\nthe average potential across the polar cap. The potential is a\nmeasure of how much flux is flowing into or out of the polar\ncap. Averaged over time we would expect these two values of\nthe potential to be the same. The fact that they are not would\nsuggest that the equatorward edge of the convection zone lies\nequatorward of the radars\u2019 fields-of-view. The convection\nzone moving to lower latitudes is the most likely cause of the\nplateau of the low-latitude potential around substorm onset.\nParkinson et al. (2003) presented observations of an auroral\nwestward flow channel observed during a substorm by the\nTIGER SuperDARN radar in the Southern Hemisphere. The\nauroral flow channel was located at a relatively low latitude\nof \u223c\u221265\u25e6 in the evening sector, had a width of \u223c2\u25e6\u22123\u25e6 lat-\nitude and had a maximum westward velocity of >1.3 kms\u22121\nduring the expansion phase. We suggest that the strong west-\nward flows observed in this study at the equatorward edge\nof the radars\u2019 f-o-v in the post-dusk sector at, and after, sub-\nstorm onset could well be the poleward edge of the auroral\nwestward flow channel observed by Parkinson et al. (2003).\nThe Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN radars are clearly not\nobserving the equatorward edge of the flow channel, which\nwould explain the underestimation of the potential across the\nreturn flow region.\nIn this present statistical study IMF information was pro-\nvided by the ACE spacecraft. The average IMF By and Bz\ncomponents were negative during the entire substorm inter-\nval. The IMF Bz component increased (became less nega-\ntive) before onset, and then decreased slightly at substorm\nonset. These results agree well with the results of Caan et\nal. (1978), who performed a statistical study involving su-\nperposed epoch averages of the IMF conditions associated\nwith the onset of \u223c1800 substorm events from four hours\nbefore onset to four hours afterwards. They found that for\nonsets separated from each other by at least four hours, the\naverage Bz (GSM) component was southward for the entire\ninterval. The Bz component increased in the 20 min or so\nbefore onset, and then decreased slightly at substorm onset.\nHowever, Caan et al. (1978) did not include any calculation\nof the propagation delay time between the satellite in the so-\nlar wind and the magnetopause in their study. Thus, they\nestimated that the actual delay time between the northward\nrecovery of the IMF and substorm onset was about 10 min-\nutes. Previous studies have shown that IMF conditions will\naffect the location of radar backscatter. For example, a study\nby Provan et al. (1999) on the occurrence of pulsed iono-\nspheric flows as observed by a SuperDARN radar showed the\nstatistical location of such flows to be strongly dependent on\nthe IMF By component. In order to further investigate the af-\nfect of the IMF conditions on the statistical flow patterns, we\ndivided the 67 substorm intervals into two groups depending\non the prevailing IMF By conditions as measured by the ACE\nspacecraft. Figure 15a presents the cosine-fitted flow vectors\nat substorm onset for the substorms which had a negative\nIMF By component at this time, Figure 15b presents the flow\nvectors at substorm onset for days which had a positive IMF\nBy component. Cowley and Lockwood (1992) presented the-\noretically inferred convection patterns in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere under various IMF conditions. The authors stated\nthat during negative IMF Bz and By conditions an oblong\n\u201cbanana\u201d shaped convection cell should be observed in the\ndusk region and a rounder \u201corange\u201d shaped cell should be\nobserved in the dawn region. Under negative IMF Bz and\npositive By conditions the authors inferred that the opposite\nshould be observed with the \u201cbanana\u201d shaped cell being ob-\nserved in the dawn region and the \u201corange\u201d shaped cell being\nobserved in the dusk region. The results presented in Fig. 15\nagree with the work of Cowley and Lockwood (1992). Un-\nder negative IMF By conditions a small \u201cbanana\u201d shaped\ncell can be clearly observed in the dusk region, with a larger\nround cell being observed in the dawn region. During pos-\nitive IMF By conditions the opposite is observed. We can\nfurther note that during the negative IMF By intervals the\nstronger and more structured high-latitude flows are observed\nin the noon\/pre-midnight region, while during the positive\nIMF By intervals the opposite is true with stronger and more\nstructured flows being observed in the dawn\/post-midnight\nregion. During the substorms presented in this study the av-\nerage IMF By component is predominantly negative, which\nexplains why the high-latitude anti-sunward plasma flows are\noften stronger in the dusk region as compared to the dawn re-\ngion.\n3622 G.

Our main observations are:\n1. The onset of the substorm growth phase is clearly ob-\nserved in the radar data 18\u201320 min before substorm on-\nset, with an increase in the amount of plasma flowing\ninto the polar-cap on the dayside, resulting in an in-\ncrease in the plasma velocity flowing across the dawn\nsector of the polar cap, and in the magnetic flux flowing\nacross the dawn-to-dusk polar-cap boundary.\n2. During the growth phase the equatorward boundary of\nnightside radar backscatter moves to lower latitude. We\nbelieve this expansion is a result of unbalanced dayside\nreconnection adding open flux to the polar cap during\nthe growth phase, causing the poleward and equator-\nward edges of the polar cap to move to lower latitudes\n(McPherron, 1970).\n3. There is evidence that the amount of magnetic flux en-\ntering the polar cap decreases in the few minutes prior\nto substorm onset. This will be an area for further re-\nsearch.\n4. At the onset of the substorm expansion phase a sup-\npressed flow region was observed on the nightside, pre-\nG. Provan et al.: Statistical study of high-latitude plasma flow 3623\nmidnight of the position of the auroral onset region. We\ntentatively identify this as the position of the auroral\nbulge. Faster flows surround this flow suppressed re-\ngion.\n5. At expansion phase onset there is a substantial decline\nin the occurrence of radar bacskscatter; this decline con-\ntinues for at least 30 min after substorm expansion phase\nonset. This is believed to be due to the nightside precip-\nitation and enhancement of auroral absorption.\n6. During both the substorm growth and expansion phases\nthere is dawn-dusk asymmetry in the strength of the\nlow-latitude return flow, with stronger flows being ob-\nserved in the pre-midnight region. This is due to the\nradars moving with the rotation of the Earth, with re-\nspect to the plasma flow.\n7. The dawn-to-dusk polar cap potential increases from\n\u223c40 kV 2 minutes before substorm onset, to \u223c75 kV\n12 min after onset. This increase occurs even though\nthe average IMF Bz component is increasing (becoming\nless negative) from 5 min before substorm onset until\n4 min after substorm onset. This demonstrates that the\nprocess of nightside reconnection is driving enhanced\nflux across the polar cap.\n8. The velocities within the low-latitude return flow region\nstart to increase at substorm onset, until 8 min after sub-\nstorm onset. Flow across the polar cap reaches a max-\nimum 12\u201314 min after substorm onset. Thus, nightside\nreconnection during the substorm expansion phase is\nadding plasma flux to the polar cap and exciting large-\nscale plasma flow. Enhancement of plasma flow around\nthe nightside flow suppression region may also be par-\ntially responsible for the increased velocities.\n9. The potential across the low-latitude return flow re-\ngions is significantly smaller than the potential across\nthe high-latitude polar-cap region, indicating the equa-\ntoward boundary of the convection zone is equatorward\nof the SuperDARN field-of-view.\n10. The observed plasma flow patterns are strongly affected\nby the prevailing IMF By conditions, as previously pre-\ndicted by Cowley and Lockwood (1992). At substorm\nonset during negative IMF By conditions the dusk con-\nvection cell is small and \u201cbanana\u201d shaped, while the\ndawn convection cell is larger and rounder. The oppo-\nsite is true during positive IMF By intervals.\n11. The dawn-dusk asymmetry in the strength of the night-\nside high-latitude equatorward flows are driven by the\nprevailing negative IMF By conditions.\nThis is the first study to prove statistically that nightside re-\nconnection excites high-latitude plasma flow in a similar way\nto dayside reconnection (Freeman and Southwood, 1988)\nand that dayside and nightside reconnection are two sepa-\nrate time-dependent processes as predicted by Lockwood et\nal. (1990) and Cowley and Lockwood (1992).\nAcknowledgements. CUTLASS is supported by the Parti-\ncle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC grant\nPPA\/R\/R\/1997\/00256).
