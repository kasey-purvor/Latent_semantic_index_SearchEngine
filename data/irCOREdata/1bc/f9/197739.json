When \ncompleting the fieldwork for the study reported here, it was not uncommon for the \nresearcher to be asked whether there was something much more interesting that he\u201fd \nrather observe. In fact, the mundane reality of most mode of trial decisions confirmed \nthis view (Cammiss, 2006a; Herbert, 2003 and 2004), and there were many times \nwhen the researcher would have preferred to have been elsewhere. Nevertheless, \nmode of trial has exercised the mind of politicians and policy makers over the \ndecades. More recently, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, had mode of trial within its \nsights in various ways (Cammiss, 2006a; Taylor, Wasik, and Leng, 2004), the aim \nsimply being to reduce the number of triable either way cases that reach the Crown \nCourt. This legislative initiative was, in several respects, the result of a process that \nbegan much earlier. Many of the initiatives within the 2003 Act can be traced to the \ntwo failed Mode of Trial Bills of 1999 and 2000, and the findings of the Auld Report \n(2001). Similarly, the Narey Report (Home Office, 1997), the Royal Commission on \nCriminal Justice (1993) and the Report of the James Committee (Home Office and \nLord Chancellor\u201fs Office, 1975) all recommended reform of the procedure. These \nreports have been supplemented by legislative and administrative activity, such as \nofficial guidance on mode of trial decision making, for example, the soon to be \n2 \ndefunct Mode of Trial Guidelines\n1\n, and the introduction of plea before venue.\n2\n For \nover 30 years, since the publication of the Report of the James Committee, policy \nmakers have been attempting to persuade magistrates to take more cases and convince \ndefendants to consent to summary trial. \n \nWhy has such a simple procedure caused so much political and legislative activity? \nOn the face of it, there appears to be little reason for this. Mode of Trial hearings \nconcern the middle ranking category of criminal cases. Summary offences have to \nremain in the magistrates\u201f court while indictable-only offences are sent to the Crown \nCourt. For triable either way offences, to simplify somewhat, magistrates decide \nwhether or not to accept jurisdiction with the defendant retaining a right to elect \nCrown Court trial. Over 95 per cent of all criminal cases remain in the magistrates\u201f \ncourt (Home Office, 2006) and indictable-only offences constitute a substantial \nminority of the Crown Court\u201fs workload; 40 per cent (Crown Prosecution Service, \n2006). However, the mode of trial process is situated at a crossroads where the rights \nof defendants and the cost of justice intersect. While the evidence is somewhat dated, \nit does suggest that defendants value the ability to elect Crown Court trial (Bottoms \nand Mclean, 1976; Gregory, 1976; Riley and Vennard, 1988; Hedderman and Moxon, \n1992), although it must be noted that elections have dwindled as a proportion of all \neither way cases that are sent to the Crown Court (Home Office, 2006). Linked to this \nis the important question of whether minority ethnic defendants prefer Crown Court \ntrial (Fitzgerald, 1993). Additionally, evidence hints at a better chance of acquittal in \n                                                 \n1\n The Guidelines were initially advertised in a practice note in 1990 ([1990] 3 All ER 979-981) but the \nupdated version can now be found in Blackstone\u2019s Criminal Practice (Murphy and Stockdale 2006). \nThe sentencing guidelines council have published draft National Allocation Guidelines that can be \naccessed at www.sentencing-guidelines.gov.uk and these will supersede the Mode of Trial Guidelines. \n2\n Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. \n3 \nthe Crown Court.\n3\n The ability to elect Crown Court trial is regarded by many as an \nimportant point of principle. Previous legislative reforms have attempted to remove \nthe defendant\u201fs right to elect Crown Court trial and these faced vociferous opposition. \nFor instance, in the House of Lords debates on the Mode of Trial Bills, peers \ndescribed the right to elect as an ancient right that originated from Magna Carta.\n4\n \n \nThe impetus for these reforms can be largely explained on grounds of economy. \nCrown Court trial is regarded as expensive and a host of additional costs are incurred. \nFor instance, Hedderman and Moxon (1992) suggest that defendants in the Crown \nCourt receive comparatively heavier sentences (although the evidence presented by \nthe Halliday Report suggests that this conclusion may no longer be valid (Home \nOffice, 2001)) and that electing Crown Court trial will both impact upon defendants \nand the system through increased costs associated with higher rates of imprisonment. \nThey also note higher costs resulting from remanding defendants to custody for a \nCrown Court hearing and the delays that impact on the workings of the Crown Court \nas a result of an increased caseload. \n \nDespite this political interest, there has been a relative dearth of research on mode of \ntrial. The James Committee commissioned research by Gregory (1976) and Bottoms \nand McClean (1976) looked at the preferences of defendants. More recently, two \nHome Office research studies have examined the mode of trial process (Riley and \n                                                 \n3\n At the time the Criminal Law 1976 progressed through parliament, doubt was cast on whether a \ndefendant did have greater prospect of acquittal in the magistrates\u201f court (HL Deb vol 379 cols 601-\n602 26 January). These figures were shown to be unreliable (Vennard, 1981) while later evidence \nsupports the initial view. Studies by Vennard, when controlling for evidential case features, suggest \nthat venue has a bearing on conviction with a greater chance of acquittal in the Crown Court (Vennard, \n1982 and 1985). Hedderman and Moxon (1992) also report greater conviction rates in the magistrates\u201f \ncourt. \n4\n For instance, for the Committee stage of the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill, see 20 January \n2000, HL Debs, Vol 608, Cols 1246-1298. \n4 \nVennard, 1988; Hedderman and Moxon, 1992) and within the last decade only two \nresearchers have examined the mechanics of the mode of trial process (Cammiss, \n2006a, 2006b and 2007; Herbert 2003 and 2004). It appears that as politicians have \nattempted to reduce the workload of the Crown Court, academics have had less and \nless to say on the process. It could, therefore, be argued that the proposed and enacted \nreforms have taken place within a knowledge vacuum and, to some extent, have \nmissed the mark. Nevertheless, we do know a little about the mode of trial process. \n \nThe mode of trial hearing \n \nThe mode of trial hearing is a relatively straightforward procedure. While this has \nbeen amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, this paper will describe the elements \nof these hearings as conducted during the research.\n5\n  \n \nA mode of trial hearing only takes place if the defendant either pleads not guilty or \ndeclines to indicate a plea. A guilty plea leads to a sentencing hearing. If the case \nproceeds to mode of trial, initially the prosecutor makes an observation to the court, \nlargely in the form of a narrative of the events that are alleged to have happened and \nwhich form the basis of the charge (Cammiss, 2006c). This will nearly always be \naccompanied by a recommendation as to where the case should be tried. The defence \nsolicitor is then given an opportunity to address the court, although on most occasions \nthey remain silent; magistrates are to make their decision on the basis that the \nprosecution can prove their case and this, therefore, leaves little room for argument. \nAdditionally, if a defendant wishes to elect Crown Court trial, they can do so \n                                                 \n5\n  The reforms in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 are examined in Cammiss (2006a). \n5 \nregardless of the decision of the magistrates. After the defence representations, the \nbench come to a decision. If they decline jurisdiction, the case is sent to the Crown \nCourt. If they accept jurisdiction, the defendant is given the opportunity of consenting \nto summary trial. If he consents, the case remains in the magistrates\u201f court. If not, the \ncase is sent to the Crown Court. \n \nResearch evidence on mode of trial \n \nPrevious research studies have been explored in detail elsewhere (Cammiss, 2007), so \nthis paper will largely present an overview of these findings, mostly to provide some \ncontext to this study. \n \nBy and large, most commentators have agreed that mode of trial hearings are regarded \nas largely mundane and straightforward. As explained above, when completing the \nfieldwork for this research, the researcher was frequently asked if he would not want \nto address something much more interesting. Herbert (2003) reports how magistrates \nview mode of trial as unimportant and how the vast majority of hearings were \ncompleted within five minutes, and Cammiss (2006a) describes how mode of trial is \nlargely viewed as a straightforward procedure that operates on the basis of common \nassumptions and shared knowledge. Finally, Hedderman and Moxon report that \ncourtroom professionals view most decisions as clear-cut. \n \nThe consequence of this view is that it is difficult to persuade interview respondents \nto articulate the important variables in mode of trial decisions. When completing the \nfieldwork for this study, the researcher observed the induction of a new Dedicated \n6 \nCase Worker. On mode of trial, the caseworker was told that the decision was largely \nintuitive, and they would eventually \u201eget the hang of it\u201f. As a result, studies such as \nHedderman and Moxon (1992), where non case specific interviews were held with \nprosecutors, provide largely unremarkable data and little more than broad \ngeneralisations and truisms that guide the courtroom professionals. Little effort is \nmade to evaluate how these operate in situ. Concrete findings are restricted to areas \nsuch as the high degree of agreement between the bench and prosecutors. Riley and \nVennard (1988), for instance, note that the bench accepted the prosecution\u201fs \nrecommendation in 93 per cent of cases; Cammiss (2007) reports a figure of 96 per \ncent. The reports all speculate on the basis for this agreement. Cammiss (2006a) \nsuggests that prosecutors are able to manage the hearing through the provision of \neffective information whereas Hedderman and Moxon (1992) point towards the \nexistence of a local court culture. Herbert (2004) suggests that both reasons are \nsimplistic and the reality is probably best understood as a construct of both \nexplanations combining in a complex courtroom process that is influenced by local \nculture, but one where prosecutors are valued as impartial professional experts. \n \nCourtroom culture has also been raised more generally as an explanatory aid in \nunderstanding mode of trial decisions. Herbert (2004), in particular, notes how local \nmagistrates\u201f courts feel the need to respond to local problems and value the concept of \nlocal justice. Hedderman and Moxon (1992) report large differentials between \ndifferent court areas as do Riley and Vennard (1988), who additionally point to the \nimportance of local guidance (Riley and Vennard reported before the delivery of the \nNational Mode of Trial Guidelines, when local Crown Court judges would instead \nprovide guidance on mode of trial). This focus upon local cultures is not unique to \n7 \nmode of trial. Indeed, local courtroom cultures have been utilised to explain \ndifferentials in sentencing and the granting of bail (Rumgay, 1995; Hucklesby, 1997). \n \nOne final area needs to be explored. The evidence here is very sparse, but there is \nreason to suspect that race is an important variable within the mode of trial decision \nmaking process. Two studies point to the possibility that magistrates\u201f are more likely \nto decline jurisdiction in cases with minority ethnic defendants (Brown and Hullin, \n1992; Jefferson and Walker, 1992). Brown and Hullin conceded that they had \ninsufficient information to test whether this differential was the result of legally \nrelevant variables or pointed instead towards discrimination, and suggested further \nresearch on this point. \n \nIn order to build upon these findings, this paper will offer a quantitative analysis of \ndata collected on mode of trial hearings in an attempt to identify which variables are \nrelated to the bench\u201fs decision. Before this analysis is presented, the statistical \nmethods implemented will be explained.  \n \nMethodology \n \nData collection \n \nIn many respects this study represents a small scale exploratory project that aims to \nbuild an initial picture of the mode of trial decision; therefore, upon entry to the field, \nwe did not wish to predetermine the variables that would be collected. With this in \nmind we aimed to develop an understanding of the process in situ; initially cases were \n8 \nsimply observed with a rudimentary attempt at data collection. The purpose of this \npreliminary stage was to build a picture of what information was available, and also to \ngain a grasp of what seemed important. Shadowing of prosecutors, informal \nconversations and file inspection were the first methods chosen to build upon the \nunderstanding gained from the literature review, which had given some idea as to the \nvariables worthy of study.  \n \nAfter this pilot phase, a data capture form was produced that focused upon a number \nof different variables. Due to previous research findings, the study was designed with \ncourt cultures in mind, so two court venues with differing characteristics were chosen. \nThe research was based in one CPS area covering an urban (City) and small town \n(County) court, with the fieldwork beginning in March 2001 and completed in nine \nmonths. The researcher gained access to the CPS for the research; 12 prosecutors \nwere shadowed in the City Court and nine in the County magistrates\u201f court.6 The \nmajority of the fieldwork was spent within the City court, with 70 mode of trial \nhearings observed there, and a further 30 in the County court, giving a final sample \ncomprising 100 hearings in total.  \n \nFor each hearing an accurate record was made of our outcome variable of interest (i.e. \nwhether or not the bench accepted jurisdiction), the circumstances of the hearing (e.g. \ncourt location, number of defendants), and the nature of the offence in question. \nFurthermore, access to the CPS allowed for detailed notes to be taken from \nprosecution files, enabling the collection of information on demographic background \nand past offences for each defendant. Additionally, a research diary was produced in \n                                                 \n6\n We are grateful to the CPS for providing access and all the prosecutors, caseworkers and \nadministrative staff who generously donated their time. Unfortunately, it is not possible to name any \none person individually as one of the conditions of access was the granting of anonymity. \n9 \norder to record general observations on the mode of trial hearing and the general \nworkings of the magistrates\u201f courts observed. \n \n \nGiven the importance of demographic features generally in research of this nature, a \nnumber were collected as a matter of course such as the age of defendants, their \nemployment status, ethnic origin and gender. Additional variables recorded included \nprevious convictions; previous studies have questioned whether previous convictions \nimpact upon the mode of trial decision (Hedderman and Moxon, 1992). The remand \nstatus of the defendant was also monitored because past studies have identified this as \nan important variable in understanding decision making within the courtroom \n(Bottomley, 1970; King, 1971). The busy City court heavily relied upon the work of \nDistrict Judges and previous research has questioned whether they are more severe in \ntheir decision making (Seago et. al., 1995); this was definitely believed to be the case \nby the local criminal justice professionals. As a result, it was noted whether a lay \nbench or District Judge presided over the case. Given that the information was readily \navailable, data was also collected on whether the defendant was legally represented.  \n \nBy far the most obvious factors to consider were those related to the substance of the \nallegations in the case in question. Information was collected on the details of the \ncharge and the nature of the case against the defendant. This was provided in the case \nfiles and presented within the mode of trial hearing. As part of the narrative of the \nallegations, prosecutors would explain the details of the case against the defendant, \nhighlighting those features which were regarded as aggravating, allowing for a \nrelatively unambiguous view of the case features that were regarded as important to \n10 \nthe court. Additionally, some magistrates, especially District Judges, would explain in \ntheir decision the case features that they regarded as most important. Finally, initial \nqualitative analysis suggested that cases of domestic violence were treated differently \nwithin the mode of trial hearing (Cammiss, 2006b). This feature was therefore \nidentified as an important variable to collect for the subsequent analysis. \n \nMeasures \n \nThe outcome variable of this study is the decision of the magistrates in the mode of \ntrial hearing (coded 0 = Crown Court vs 1 = Summary Trial). \n \nFor each hearing we had a number of background measures relating to the setting and \nthe defendant. These were in turn: court location (0 = County vs 1 = City), whether or \nnot the defendant(s) had been remanded in custody; whether they had legal \nrepresentation (1 = Yes vs 0 = No); whether the hearing was dealt with by a lay bench \nor District Judge, and measures of the demographic profile of the defendant(s): age; \ngender (coded 0 = Female vs 1 = Male); ethnic origin (0 = Non-white vs 1 = White); \nand employment status (0 = Unemployed vs 1 = Employed). We also had a record of \nwhether the defendant(s) in those cases retained for summary trial elected instead for \nCrown Court trial, and in cases with more than one defendant, the nature of any \nrelationship between them. \n \nFor each defendant we had detailed records of their previous convictions and \ncautions. This information was consolidated into variables representing the numbers \nof each for nine different offence types: Theft; Public Disorder; Offences related to \n11 \nPolice\/Courts\/Prisons; Offences Against Person; Offences Against Property; Sex \nOffences; Drugs; Firearms\/Offensive Weapons; and Other\/miscellaneous Offences.  \nFrom these we calculated two further variables; the total number of previous cautions \nand convictions respectively over all offences.  \n \nWe recorded the nature of the offence(s) of which the defendant(s) were accused. \nEach case consisted of one or more charges up to 32 different offence types; this \ninformation was combined to form a smaller number of variables each describing \nwhether the defendant(s) were charged with one of eight basic types of offence, \nspecifically: Offence Against Person; Driving offences; Theft and related offences; \nPublic disorder; Possession (of weapon, etc); Drugs offences; Damage; Sex offences; \nand for Miscellaneous offences. The number of charges over this set of offences was \nalso summed to give a Total number of charges variable.  \n \nIn addition, for each case we had further information regarding the specifics of the \noffence, such as the extent of any assault carried out, injuries caused, the use of \nthreats,  the amount of drugs found, the level of damage caused, the extent of any \nthreatening behaviour, the volume of property stolen, and any aggravating features. \nFrom this we produced nine more \u201elevels of offence\u201f variables; three indicators of \nwhether there was any threatening behaviour, aggravating features and\/or any further \nlegal issues (all coded 0 = Yes vs 1 = No), and six measures of level of: assault; \ninjuries sustained by the victim; threats made; damage committed; property taken; \ndrug offence (all coded 0 = None vs 1 = Non-serious vs 2 = Serious; for entry into our \nregression analyses each was represented by a pair of dichotomous dummy variables, \nwith None as the reference category). Finally we had an indicator variable for whether \n12 \nthe charge against the defendants contained allegations of domestic violence (0 = Yes \nvs 1 = No). \n \nThe \u201edefendant level\u201f nature of some of the observed measures presented a potential \nproblem since our outcome variable, decision on mode of trial hearing, was at the \n\u201ecase level\u201f Therefore, for the few cases where there was more than one defendant, \nthose variables which varied by defendant (e.g. number of past offences, ethnic \norigin) were aggregated to from an appropriate summary measure (e.g. total number \nof past offences across defendants, any non-white defendants). \n \nStatistical Methods \n \nThe first stage of the analysis was an exploration of the basic sample properties, \nfollowed by an assessment of the correlations between our outcome and predictor \nvariables.  \n \nWe then attempted to construct a regression model for the prediction of mode of trial \nhearing decision. This outcome variable is dichotomous in form, hence we used a \nseries of logistic regression analyses to assess the effect of our predictors together. \nWith our relatively small sample size and large number of measures, entering all of \nthe potential predictors concurrently was not possible; rather we used a hierarchical \nstrategy. Initially we considered just the \u201ebackground and demographics\u201f set of \npredictors, examining which of these variables were significantly related to the mode \nof trial decision. Retaining the significant predictors from this set in the model, we \nthen entered the measures of \u201eprevious convictions\u201f, again keeping only those that \n13 \nwere significant. This process was repeated for the \u201etype of offence charged\u201f and \nfinally the \u201elevel of offence\u201f variables. As a final check, each of the variables that had \nbeen excluded after the first, second and third steps were considered for re-entry (i.e. \nentered individually and removed unless they significantly improved the model). \n \nIn all our analyses we applied the p < 0.05 level of statistical significance. Given the \nexploratory nature of this study we used two-tailed tests throughout. \n \nResults \n \nOf the 100 mode of trial hearings in our sample, magistrates retained jurisdiction in \n43 per cent of cases (and in a further nine cases the defendant elected Crown Court \ntrial after the bench accepted jurisdiction). Seventy percent were dealt with in the City \nCourt, with 53 per cent of these overseen by District Judges. The vast majority (91 per \ncent) featured just one defendant, in 23 per cent at least one defendant had been \nremanded in custody, and all but two cases saw the defendant(s) using legal \nrepresentation.  In 94 per cent of cases the defendant(s) were (all) male, 30 per cent \nfeatured at least one non-white defendant, and 72 per cent involved at least one non-\nemployed defendant. The age of defendants ranged between 18 and 54 years, with an \naverage of 29 years. The average and spread of the previous and charged offence \nvariables are given in table 1. \n \nThe correlations between our study variables (see table 1) indicated medium-sized \nassociations between the mode of trial hearing recommendation and assault level, \ninjury level and gender, though the latter variable was of minimal interest given the \n14 \nlack of female defendants. They also reflected strong associations between court \nlocation and both ethnic origin of defendants and use of lay bench or District Judges; \nand a strong positive relationship between defendants being remanded in custody and \nprevious convictions for different offences.  \n \nThe first step our model building process indicated that of our set of demographic and \nbackground variables, only court location was significantly related to retention for \nsummary trial, with those cases in the City Court less likely to be retained, though \ncustody was also approaching significance at the p < 0.05 level and was retained for \nthe next step (cases where defendant(s) were remanded in custody were less likely to \nbe retained for summary trial). Together court location and custody significantly \nimprove the model fit (\u0394 Chi-square = 7.5 on 2 df, P < 0.05). None of the measures of \nprevious convictions were found to be significant predictors. \n \nNext the set of measures of the offence being charged were examined; of these being \ncharged with drugs offences was significantly negatively associated with retention for \nsummary trial; conversely cases featuring allegations of domestic violence were \nsignificantly positively associated with the decision to retain for summary trial. \nTogether these two variables significantly improved the model fit (\u0394 Chi-square = 9.4 \non 2 df, P < 0.05). \n \nThe set of variables measuring level of offence was then entered; cases involving \nserious levels of assault, serious injuries inflicted or serious property offences were all \nfound to be significantly less likely to be retained for summary trial. These were kept \n15 \nin the model; together they further improved the fit of the model (\u0394 Chi-square = 30.8 \non 6 df, P < 0.05). \n \nLastly the demographic, previous convictions and offence type variables that were \npreviously found to be non-significant were each checked to confirm they did not \nsignificantly improve to the model. Of these, only the addition of ethnic origin \nimproved the model significantly (\u0394 Chi-square = 5.7 on 1 df, P < 0.05), with the \nodds of a cases involving all white defendant(s) being retained for summary trial \nestimated as 6 times those of a case involving non-white defendants (Exp(B) = 6.0). \nAs a result of this, the effect of court location was no longer significant at the p < 0.05 \nlevel; this was due to a strong relationship between ethnicity of defendant and court \nlocation resulting in much of the predictive effect of the latter being subsumed by that \nof the former.  \n \nThe full details of our final model are given in table 2. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe first variables that emerge as important in the data are those related to the specific \noffence. So, serious assaults are more likely to be deemed not suitable for summary \ntrial, in accordance with the mode of trial guidelines, as are serious property offences. \nSimilarly, assaults that resulted in serious injuries would also be statistically more \nlikely to be sent to the Crown Court. These trends disguise differences in individual \ncases and these are further explored elsewhere (Cammiss, 2007). Finally, drug \noffences were also more likely to sent to the Crown Court. A possible reason for this \n16 \nrelates to investigative practices. Most of the drug offences that proceeded to mode of \ntrial were relatively serious; it could well be the case that relatively trivial offences of \nmere possession of non class A drugs were either diverted from the criminal justice \nprocess or resulted in a caution. If this was the case, only the most serious drug \noffences were prosecuted and these were more likely to be regarded as not suitable for \nsummary trial by both prosecutor and bench. Putting aside this minor anomaly, we \nwould expect that offence seriousness would impact upon the mode of trial decision. \nThe mode of trial guidelines, in force at the time of the fieldwork, point towards likely \nsentence and specific aggravating features as an important consideration in the \ndetermination of venue. These findings are, in that context, unsurprising and non-\nproblematic. However, in addition to these findings, others raise different questions. \n \nSome of these additional findings build upon the earlier research studies and provide \nsome interesting data. The correlation between court venue and our outcome suggests \nthat it is an important predictor for the mode of trial decision, in common with \nHerbert (2004) and Hedderman and Moxon (1992); however, when the confounding \nvariable of ethnicity is introduced into our model its effect was reduced. Again, the \nunderlying finding is, to some extent, expected, given the importance attached to \ncourtroom culture by other researchers in this field. An important caveat, however, \nneeds to be made here concerning the numbers in the sample. Only 30 cases were \nanalysed from the smaller court with 70 from the busy urban court. This was, in part, \na reflection of the aims of the study, and partly a pragmatic decision. However, given \nthat the findings replicate previous studies, we can assume that some weight can be \nattached to these. This particular conclusion can also shed some light onto the \ndiscussion above as to whether the high degree of concordance between prosecutor\u201fs \n17 \nrecommendation and the bench\u201fs decision results from local cultures or prosecutorial \ncontrol of the mode of trial process. The two courts researched were within one CPS \narea. We could hypothesise that if the prosecution did effectively manage and control \nthe mode of trial hearing, we would expect both courts to make similar decisions as \nthere would be little reason to expect prosecutors to differ to a great extent in the same \nbranch. However, we cannot make this conclusion with any degree of certainty. While \nit is true to say that the prosecutors for both courts were part of the same branch, and \nwere indeed within the same office, it would not be true to say that they worked \nclosely together. There was a City and a County team within the office, and this \nseparation was reinforced geographically with both teams on different floors. They \neach conducted their own team meetings where they discussed the issues important to \ntheir work, and observation concluded that they each had very different priorities. \nWhile individuals would cover for their colleagues in different teams, such \u201ecross \nfertilisation\u201f was rare and there were no obvious institutional mechanisms to share \nknowledge and experience. The separation between the teams was so pronounced that \nthere could be said to be a degree of rivalry between the sections. The City branch, in \nparticular, were disparaging of their County colleagues. Upon finishing the fieldwork \nphase with the City team, the researcher was left in little doubt that the City \nprosecutors thought he was about to enter a \u201elegal backwater\u201f whereupon nothing \nmuch would happen and everything would be very slow. To some extent, this view \nrepresented a degree of truth. This schism between the courts was also reinforced by \nthe rarity of defence solicitors appearing in both courts. All in all, while the two \ncourts were less than 20 miles apart, they were, metaphorically speaking, worlds \napart. Given the working practices of the CPS and the distinct split within the branch, \nwe are no further forward in identifying the dominant party in the maintenance of the \n18 \nlocal court cultures observed, although a qualitative analysis elsewhere places great \nemphasis upon the ability of the CPS to manage the information that is placed before \nthe court (Cammiss, 2006a). \n \nOther findings are also worthy of comment, although care needs to be taken in how \nmuch emphasis can be placed upon them. The importance of custody is a case in \npoint. The model developed above suggests that being remanded in custody increases \nthe chances of the bench declining jurisdiction after accounting for important case \nvariables. Again, this is to some extent unsurprising; previous studies have reported \nthat a custodial remand increases the probability of a custodial sentence being \nimposed upon conviction (Bottomley, 1970; King, 1971). A defendant who is \nremanded in custody is placed at a structural disadvantage in that they appear with a \nsecurity officer, behind screens \u2013 thereby giving the impression of being a dangerous \nindividual \u2013 and are often shabbily dressed and presented. If these findings are valid, \nthis could well be another example of how initial decisions within the criminal justice \nprocess impact upon later decisions and act in concert together. If Hedderman and \nMoxon (1992) are correct, that being sent to the Crown Court increases the chance of \na custodial sentence and the length of any sentence, then being remanded in custody \nmay impact twice on the eventual sentence in that it both leads directly to an \nincreased likelihood of a custodial sentence on conviction, and increases the \nlikelihood of being sent to the Crown Court which in turn raises the probability of a \ncustodial sentence and the length of that sentence. \n \nWithin the sample, a number of cases concerned allegations of domestic violence. \nThis cases have been subjected to a qualitative evaluation elsewhere (Cammiss, \n19 \n2006b) but it is interesting to note that those conclusions are supported here. In short, \nit appears that allegations of domestic violence are more likely to remain within the \nmagistrates\u201f court, thereby minimising the impact of these allegations. As explained \nelsewhere, this is largely achieved through the management of information that is \nplaced before the court. It has also been hypothesised that the reasons for this \napproach lie within considerations of cost and managing workloads. Within the CPS \nbranch researched, there existed a belief that, by and large, domestic violence cases \nwould fail before reaching trial, largely because the complainant withdrew from the \nprocess upon reconciliation between the parties. \n \nA tentative note can be added regarding previous convictions. The relationship \nbetween previous convictions and any eventual decision was mentioned by \nHedderman and Moxon (1992), who noted that while magistrates are not given this \ninformation, prosecutors are aware of previous convictions and could, therefore, take \nthem into account. Indeed, one prosecutor did indicate to the researcher that previous \nconvictions would be important in \u201eborderline cases\u201f and could tip the balance \ntowards a representation that the case be regarded as not suitable for summary trial. \nOur study failed to find a significant relationship between the mode of trial decision \nand the existence of previous convictions; nevertheless, it is a variable worthy of note \ngiven the findings of previous studies and the speculation that prosecutor\u201fs do take \nprevious convictions into account when making their recommendations. \n \nLastly, as noted above, race appears to be an independently relevant variable in the \nfinal model yet, due to the number of variables incorporated in the final model and the \nlimited number of cases incorporated into the study, any conclusions must be, at best, \n20 \ntentative. As explained in the introduction, two previous studies have noted a \ndifferential in the rate at which minority ethnic defendants are committed to the \nCrown Court but could not determine whether this variable remained after accounting \nfor legally relevant case features (Brown and Hullin, 1992; Jefferson and Walker, \n1992). This study takes us one step closer to addressing the issue, and a tentative \nconclusion could be made that race does impact upon the mode of trial decision, \nindependent of other case features. However, it must be said that this is an extremely \ntentative conclusion and, following Brown and Hullin (1992), further research is \nnecessary in this area. \n \nConclusion \n \nMode of trial appears to be a somewhat straightforward decision in many respects. \nPractitioners regard it as mundane and non-problematic. Decisions are made quickly \nand prosecutors, defence solicitors and magistrates all regard it as a simple stepping \nstone which must be encountered for a case to progress through the court process. \nHowever, politicians and policy makers view mode of trial as more important than \nthis, since the result of a mode of trial hearing impacts upon other parts of the \ncriminal justice process, in particular, the workload of the Crown Court. With this in \nmind, politicians have attempted to limit the number of either way cases that reach the \nCrown Court, yet this has been attempted with little understanding of the process. \nAcademics appear to share the view of practitioners; mode of trial is generally \nregarded as unimportant. Indeed, in the latest edition of Ashworth\u201fs The Criminal \nProcess, readers interested in mode of trial are pointed towards a previous edition for \nan in-depth discussion of the issues (Ashworth and Redmayne, 2005). This, to some \n21 \nextent, reflects the paucity of research in this area (recently addressed by Herbert) but \nis still surprising given that it has remained on the policy agenda throughout the last \ndecade. Within this context, this study provides some useful information on the mode \nof trial decision making process. By and large, decisions appear to be made on the \nseriousness of the allegations. Serious drug offences, serious assaults, assaults that \ncause serious injury and serious property offences are all likely to be sent to the \nCrown Court. Yet a number of other variables appear, to differing extents, to be \ninfluential. Court venue and culture, allegations of domestic violence, custodial \nremands and race all play a part in the model resulting from our analyses. It is clear \nthat this study cannot make definitive conclusions on this matter, but further research \nis needed to better understand the mode of trial process, and research that attempts to \nexamine the decision making process in situ. \n \nReferences \n \nAshworth, A and Redmayne, M.
