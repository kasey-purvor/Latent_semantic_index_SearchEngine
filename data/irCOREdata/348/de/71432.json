INTRODUCTION\nONE of the challenges of communicating a signal over amedium is the distortion and loss of signal power caused\nby the medium. Such a phenomenon, commonly termed\nchannel fading, results in fluctuation of the signals received. To\ncombat channel fading, diversity techniques, whereby signals\ncarrying the same information are transmitted and received\nover different resources, are commonly used. Traditionally,\nto introduce diversity, the multiple copies of message signal\nwill span time, frequency or spatial resources [1]. A new\ntechnique to introduce diversity into the system, in which\nmultiple spatially separated communication devices (nodes)\ncooperate to improve the quality of communications between\ntwo nodes was proposed in [2], [3]. Such systems are able to\nintroduce diversity into the system by using cooperative nodes\nto relay the information to the destination after some delay.\nSeveral protocols to accomplish the task has been introduced\nin [2], of which, Amplify and Forward (AF) has been shown\nto achieve full diversity.\nSince then, there have been many algorithms proposed to\nmanipulate the relay nodes to enhance performance. Known\nas cooperative beamforming, most of these algorithms weigh\nManuscript received January 29, 2007; revised June 15, 2007 and August\n30, 2007; accepted September 24, 2007.

Cooperative communication system with 2 relay nodes\ntheir input according to the channel state information feed-\nback [4], [5] or prior information available [6]. The optimal\nweighting for each of the nodes has also been derived in [7].\nThere have also been algorithms to optimally allocate power\nto the different relay nodes [8], [9]. At the time of writing this\npaper, it has also come to our attention of [10], which proposed\na scheme similar to ours here. However, the two schemes are\nbased on different scenarios, and the proposed strategies of\npower allocation in both schemes are different. In this paper,\nwe present a suboptimal distributed beamforming and power\nallocation scheme which has an outage probability close to the\noptimal scheme. We further derive the outage probability of\nthe scheme and show that it offers an advantage over schemes\nwhere equal weights are assigned to the relays.\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\nConsider a cooperative network system with one source\nnode, Nr relays nodes, and one destination node as shown\nin Fig. 1. We assume that the channel state information of\nincoming and outgoing links are available at each node and\nthat these are flat fading channels. We further assume that the\ntransmission time frame for sending each message is split into\ntwo, the first being the message sending by the source node,\nwhich we term the \u201cbroadcast\u201d phase, and the second being\nthe transmission of the message by the relay nodes, which\nwe refer to as the \u201ccooperation\u201d phase. Here, we consider the\nnon-regenerative relay method.\nDuring the \u201cbroadcast\u201d phase, where a signal x is sent by\nthe source node, the received signal at the destination and\nrelay node i can be respectively written as\nys,d = hs,dx + ws,d, (1)\nand\nys,i = hs,ix + ws,i, (2)\n1536-1276\/08$25.00 c\u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

DISTRIBUTED BEAMFORMING AND POWER\nALLOCATION\nTo maximize the SNR at the destination, the optimal weight\nvector f should satisfy\nmax\nf\nE\n{\nP fHhHhf\nfHwHwf + |wr,d|2\n}\n= max\nf\nE\n{\nP fHhHhf\nfH [wHw + |wr,d|2INr ]f\n}\n, (5)\nwhere P is the overall power constraint of the relay nodes.\nThe optimal solution fopt can be found by solving the\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem\nE{[wHw + |wr,d|2INr ]}\u22121PhHhfopt = \u03bbmaxfopt (6)\nwhere \u03bbmax is the largest generalized eigenvalue of\nE{[wHw + |wr,d|2INr ]}\u22121PhHh.\nHowever, a centralized control with access to all channel\ninformation is required to obtain this optimal solution, and\nvery high system overhead is involved. In this paper, we are\ninterested in a distributed solution, where each relay node can\ndecide its transmit power based on knowledge of its incoming\nand outgoing channels, hs,i and hi,s. Here, we propose to use\nthe weight vector\nfp = \u03b2\n[\nh\u2217s,1h\n\u2217\n1,d|hs,1|2\u221a\n\u03c32n+|hs,1|2\n\u221a\nP \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 h\n\u2217\ns,Nr\nh\u2217Nr,d|hs,Nr |2\u221a\n\u03c32n+|hs,Nr |2\n\u221a\nP\n]\n(7)\nwhere \u03b2 = 1\/\n\u221a\u2211Nr\ni=1\n|hs,i|6|hi,d|2\n\u03c32n+|hs,i|2 is the normalizing constant\nsuch that the power constraint fHf = P is satisfied, and the\ncommon factor \u03b2 can be periodically obtained from the desti-\nnation node via a broadcast channel. The reason to introduce a\nconstraint for the total power consumption can be clarified as\nfollows. Although each relay node can transmit up to their own\noutput power limit, the total power constraint limits interfer-\nence to other source-destination pairs, which is an important\nissue for power-constrained communication scenarios. The full\nCSI assumption at the destination can facilitate the calculation\nof \u03b21. With such a full CSI assumption, a centralized scheme\nin (6) can be accomplished, but will still result in more system\noverhead than the proposed one. The proposed scheme only\nrequires one channel use to broadcast the power constraint to\nthe relays, whereas the centralized one requires at least Nr\nchannel uses. Furthermore, the power constraint \u03b2 is only a\nconstant or scaling factor which provides multiple relays a\nbenchmark to calculate their weighting factors. An incorrect\n\u03b2 means that all relays will operate at a sub-optimal power\nlevel. But the relationship between the weighting factors at\nthe multiple relays is still maintained, which is important\nto prevent signal cancellation among the multiple transmit\nantennas.\nNote that the transmission power of each relay in (7) is\nproportional to its incoming and outgoing channel coefficients,\nwhich fits the intuition that more power should be allocated to\nrelaying nodes with better quality links. The exact expression\nof the distributed beamformer was obtained from simulation\nexperiments which showed that in (7) achieves the perfor-\nmance close to the optimal solution. To get the insights of such\nperformance superiority, some information-theoretic metrics,\nsuch as the outage probability and the diversity-multiplexing\ntradeoff, will be developed for the proposed beamformer in\nthe next section.\nIV. OUTAGE PROBABILITY\nFor the proposed distributed beamforming and power al-\nlocation scheme, we analyze effects of the scheme on sys-\ntem performance. We focus on outage probability as the\ninformation-theoretic measure as in [2].\nFor the system described by (4), the mutual information is\nI = 1\n2\nlog\n[\n1 + (|hs,d|2 + fHhHhf)(E{nHn})\u22121\n] (8)\nwhere n =\n[\nws,d\nwf + wr,d\n]\n.\nUsing the proposed relay weights fp in (7), we obtain (9),\nwhere\nE{nHn} = 2\u03c32n + fHE{wHw}f\n= 2\u03c32n + f\nHdiag{ \u03c3\n2\nn|h1,d|2\n\u03c32n + |hs,1|2 , . . . ,\n\u03c32n|hNr,d|2\n\u03c32n + |hs,Nr |2\n}f\n= \u03c32n\n\u0000\n\u00022 +\nP\n\u0003Nr\ni=1\n|hs,i|6|hi,d|2\n\u03c32n+|hs,i|2\nNr\n\u0004\ni=1\n|hs,i|6|hi,d|4\n(\u03c32n + |hs,i|2)2\n\u0005\n\u0006 .\n(10)\n1A weaker assumption to calculate \u03b2 is that each node will send the real-\nvalued |hs,i|\n6|hi,d|2\n\u03c32n+|hs,i|2\nto the destination, and hence will consume Nr channel\nuses, whereas the full CSI assumption will require 2Nr channel uses.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

(11)\nProof: The proof is given in the Appendix.\nConsider the traditional point-to-point multiple-input single-\noutput (MISO) system as a comparable scheme. It is obvious\nthat the performance of such a MISO system is the best\nthat the proposed cooperative strategy can achieve. Provided\nthat there are Nr transmit antennas, it can can expected that\nsuch a MISO system can achieve Nr + 1 diversity gain since\nthe multiple antennas can coordinate with each other and\nhence the receiver can have Nr + 1 independent copies of\nthe transmitted signals [1]. Theorem 1 indicates that such\ndiversity gain is still achievable although the multiple antennas\nare distributed among the multiple nodes. As defined in [11],\nthe multiplexing gain is r \u0002 lim\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\nR(\u03c1)\nlog \u03c1 and the diversity gain\nis d \u0002 \u2212 lim\n\u03c1\u2192\u221e\nlog p(I<R)\nlog \u03c1 [11]. From Theorem 1, we have the\nfollowing corollary.\nCorollary 2: The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff\nachieved by the distributed beamforming and power\nallocation is given by\nd(r) = (Nr + 1)(1\u2212 2r).\nProof: Recall from the proof for Theorem 1, the outage\nprobability is bounded as\nNr(\u03b1\u03b8)Nr+1\n(Nr + 1)!\n\u2265 p(I < R) \u2265 (\u03b1\u03b8)\nNr+1\n(Nr + 1)!\n(12)\nwhere \u03b8 = 2\n2R\u22121\n\u03c1 .\nTo obtain the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the proposed\ndistributed beamforming scheme, define the data rate R as a\nfunction of \u03c1 as\nR = r log \u03c1. (13)\nSubstitute (13) into the expression of the outage probability\nand we have\nNr(\u03b1)Nr+1\n(Nr + 1)!\n(22r log \u03c1 \u2212 1)Nr+1\n\u03c1Nr+1\n\u2265 p(I < R)\n\u2265 (\u03b1)\nNr+1\n(Nr + 1)!\n(22r log \u03c1 \u2212 1)Nr+1\n\u03c1Nr+1\n(14)\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n10\u22126\n10\u22125\n10\u22124\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\nSNR\nO\nut\nag\ne \nPr\nob\nab\nilit\ny\nDistributed PC, 2 nodes\nDistributed PC, 3 nodes\nDistributed PC, 4 nodes\nDistributed PC, 5 nodes\nFig. 2. The outage probability of the proposed beamforming and power\nallocation schemes with different number of relay nodes versus SNR.\nWhen \u03c1 \u2192\u221e, we have\nlog p(I < R) = log\n(\n(\u03c12r)Nr+1\n\u03c1Nr+1\n)\n. (15)\nAnd the corollary is proved.\nIt is important to point out that although similar results\nhave been obtained previously (e.g., [11], [12]), our situation\nis unique. Provided that all antennas are located at the source\nnode, the results on full diversity order and the multiplexing-\ndiversity tradeoff could be easily obtained. However, with\nmultiple antennas scattering among the multiple nodes, The-\norem 1 and Corollary 2 are valuable as they indicate that the\nsingle-antenna source node can function as if it is equipped\nwith multiple antennas. However, it is worthy to point out\nthat such diversity gain is obtained with the price of reducing\nmultiplexing gain, which is caused by the fact that the relaying\ntransmission requires the extra use of bandwidth resources.\nIf complex radio hardware is not available, the opportunistic\nrelaying protocol can be an alternative for distributed phased-\narrays. As shown in [12] such an opportunistic scheme can\nyield the same diversity order as the proposed beamformer.\nV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nConsider a relay ad-hoc network where each node is\nequipped with one antenna element. The wireless links are\nassumed as flat Raleigh fading. The required data rate is set\nas R = 1.\nFigure 2 shows the outage performance of the proposed\ndistributed beamforming and power allocation scheme as a\nfunction of SNR, where the effect of different number of\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The outage probability of the various beamforming schemes versus\nSNR.\nrelay nodes is also shown. As can be seen from the figure, by\nincreasing the number of the used relay nodes, the proposed\nmethod can improve the system performance generally.\nIn Figure 3 the outage probability of the different beam-\nforming schemes is shown, obtained by Monte Carlo sim-\nulations. The two-relay-node scenario, Nr = 2, is consid-\nered here. The performance of two existing schemes is also\nshown here for comparison. One is the scheme, termed as\n\u201cequal gain scheme\u201d, where beamforming is not used and\neach relay just forwards its observations without weighting,\nand the other, termed as \u201ccentralized beamforming\u201d, where\nthe optimal solution of (6) is used for weighting factors.\nIt is interesting to observe that the performance of equal\npower transmission could result worse performance than direct\ntransmission, which implies that it could be better not to\nuse relay transmission without proper beamforming or power\nallocation. Furthermore, centralized power control can achieve\nbetter performance than direct transmission, as expected. And\nit can be observed that the proposed distributed method can\nhave performance of 1dB from that of the centralized one.\nFigure 4 shows the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for the\nthree transmission schemes, direct transmission, selection re-\nlaying [2] and the proposed method. As expected, direct (or\nnon cooperative) transmission can achieve a multiplexing gain\nof 1 as each orthogonal channel is only used by one user.\nSince orthogonal transmission is chosen, users cannot assist\neach other and hence there is no diversity gain. On the other\nhand, the selective relaying scheme can achieve a diversity\ngain of 2 as each copy of the transmitted message go through\n2 independent channels and hence more robustness can be\nachieved. However such diversity gain is obtained at a price.\nIt requires additional usage of bandwidth resource, i.e., time\nslots, for relaying. However, our proposed scheme can achieve\nthe full diversity of Nr + 1 while only requiring the same\namount of bandwidth resource as the selection relay scheme.\nVI.

To\nassist in the proof of the theorem, we first have following\nlemma.\nLemma 1: Let |hi,d| and |hs,i| be Rayleigh distributed\nrandom variables. For any positive finite integer Nr,(\u2211Nr\ni=1 |hs,i|2|hi,d|2\n)2\n\u2211Nr\ni=1 |hs,i|4|hi,d|2\n\u2264\nNr\u2211\ni=1\n|hi,d|2. (16)\nProof of Lemma 1: Mathematical induction is used to\nprove this lemma. Define the left and right sides of (16) as\nfunctions of Nr,\nf(n) =\n(\u2211n\ni=1 |hs,i|2|hi,d|2\n)2\u2211n\ni=1 |hs,i|4|hi,d|2\n,\ng(n) =\nn\u2211\ni=1\n|hi,d|2, for n \u2265 1. (17)\nHence proving Lemma 1 is equivalent to prove the the\nfollowing\nf(n) \u2264 g(n), for n \u2265 1, (18)\nwhich will be proved by using mathematical induction.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Note that the second equality follows\nthe high SNR assumption where \u03c32n \u2248 0.\nFor large Nr, we have the following observations.
