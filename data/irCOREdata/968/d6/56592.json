These fascinating rocks have been the focus of geological research since the 18th Century and have had a profound influence on the development of the geological sciences. Throughout the 20th Century, the excellent coastal exposures have acted as a magnet for palaeontologists, stratigraphers, sedimentologists and geochemists, as a natural geological laboratory, and in recent decades, the coastal exposures received increased scientific interest as a result of their analogy with hydrocarbon source and reservoir rocks in the North Sea. Designation of the international Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Sinemurian\u2013Pliensbachian stage boundary in Robin Hood's Bay, the establishment of the Dinosaur Coast, and development of the Rotunda Museum in Scarborough have all given the regional geology additional importance.\\ud\n\\ud\nThe Lias Group (Hettangian\u2013Toarcian age; 199.6\u2013175.6 Ma), exposed in the well known coastal sections, is illustrated by the fully cored Felixkirk Borehole, located at the western margin of the outcrop, and is one of the best examples of shallow marine sedimentation in an epeiric shelf-sea setting. It comprises two large-scale, upward coarsening cycles, namely the Redcar Mudstone to Staithes Sandstone cycle, followed by the Cleveland Ironstone to Blea Wyke Sandstone cycle. Within this broad pattern, smaller scale transgressive\u2013regressive cycles are described from stratigraphically expanded and reduced successions. Detailed ammonite biostratigraphy provides a finely calibrated temporal framework to study the variations in sedimentation, which include storm-generated limestones and sandstones (\u2018tempestites\u2019) interbedded with mudstone deposited during fair-weather periods. Hemipelagic mud, occasionally organic-rich, reflects deeper-water anoxic events that may indicate a response to global climate change.\\ud\n\\ud\nIn cores, the tempestite beds (Hettangian\u2013Sinemurian) are characterized by sharp bases that, at outcrop, are often masked by downward penetrating burrows. Cyclicity on a centimetre scale in the overlying Pliensbachian \u2018Banded Shales\u2019 may be the result of orbitally induced, climatic cycles. Gradational upward coarsening to the Staithes Sandstone Formation marks a transition to sand-rich tempestite deposits, characterized by low angle and swaley cross-lamination, interbedded with sand-starved units (striped siltstones). The sands were probably deposited from sediment-laden, storm-surge and ebb currents in inner- and mid-shelf settings; the sandy substrate was, at some levels, extensively bioturbated by deposit feeding organisms that produced a spectacular range of trace fossil assemblages characteristic of shoreface, inner-, mid-, and outer-shelf settings. Intrabasinal tectonics was a controlling factor during deposition of both the Staithes Sandstone and the overlying Cleveland Ironstone (Late Pliensbachian). The influx of sand is attributed to hinterland uplift and increased sediment flux. More marked intraformational uplift during deposition of the Cleveland Ironstone is manifested in a much attenuated succession in the west of the basin (Felixkirk); southwards, towards the Market Weighton High, the Pecten\/Main Seam of the ironstone oversteps unconformably onto progressively older beds to rest on the lower part of the Redcar Mudstone Formation. Ironstone, in the form of berthierine ooids and sideritic mud, was deposited during 5\u20136 cycles (in coastal exposures) of high sea-level stands that cut off siliciclastic influx from the low-gradient hinterland; regressive, upward-shoaling intervals are marked by interbedded, bioturbated siltstone and fine-grained sandstone.\\ud\n\\ud\nThe Toarcian succession (Whitby Mudstone and Blea Wyke Sandstone formations) continues the second upward coarsening cycle in response to increased subsidence, rising sea-level, and an influx of siliciclastic sand. Oxygenated, open marine mud was deposited during the initial deepening phase, followed by bituminous mud, attributed to ocean-water stratification and the establishment of anoxic bottom conditions; in the west of the basin an upward shoaling sequence suggests that water depths were not as great. Recent research on the geochemistry and stable isotope signatures across this early Toarcian interval indicates a widespread, global anoxic event, possibly attributed to the release of methane hydrate on the ocean floor. The Alum Shale Member represents increasingly oxygenated bottom conditions and an upward coarsening motif with passage to the Blea Wyke Sandstone Formation, which is preserved only in the Peak Trough, an actively subsiding graben. Basin uplift accompanied by gentle folding in late Toarcian to Aalenian times removed much of the late Toarcian succession so that the Middle Jurassic Dogger Formation (Aalenian), a complex, condensed, shallow water unit rests unconformably on beds as low as the Alum Shale over much of the basin.\\ud\n\\ud\nDeep boreholes and revision mapping by the British Geological Survey (BGS) in the west of the outcrop have allowed a fuller, basin-wide synthesis of the palaeoenvironments and the influence of intra-Jurassic tectonics during Mid- to Late Jurassic times. During Mid-Jurassic times the low-lying, paralic coastal plain, typified by braided and meandering fluvial systems and lacustrine deposits was invaded by marine incursions from the south and east. Each transgressive event was different in its geographical penetration across the coastal plain, resulting in varied lithofacies and palaeoenvironments including ooidal ironstone and lime mud (Eller Beck Formation), peloid and ooid carbonate shoals (Lebberston Member), and tidal sand bars, pelloidal limestones and nearshore marine muds (Scarborough Formation). Trace fossils, including dinosaur footprints, and macro-plant fossils tell us much about the palaeoenvironments on the coastal plain, during this time interval (175.6\u2013164.7 Ma) that was characterized by a warm, seasonal climate.\\ud\n\\ud\nThe basin wide transgression and marked global sea-level rise represented by the Cornbrash Formation, marks deposition in a shallow marine environment during the Callovian, followed by sand (Osgodby Formation) and deeper water muds (Oxford Clay Formation) that spread northwards from the East Midlands over the Market Weighton High during the Oxfordian. Subsequent shallowing of the basin resulted in the establishment of a carbonate\/siliciclastic platform typified by ooidal shoals, coral patch reefs and sponge spicule-rich marine sands (Corallian Group).

These fascinating rocks have been the focus of geological 42 \nresearch since the 18th century and have had a profound influence on the 43 \ndevelopment of the geological sciences. Throughout the 20th century, the excellent 44 \ncoastal exposures have acted as a magnet for palaeontologists, stratigraphers, 45 \nsedimentologists and geochemists, as a natural geological laboratory, and in recent 46 \ndecades, the coastal exposures received increased scientific interest as a result of 47 \ntheir analogy with hydrocarbon source and reservoir rocks in the North Sea. 48 \nDesignation of the international Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the 49 \nSinemurian-Pliensbachian stage boundary in Robin Hood\u2019s Bay, the establishment of 50 \nthe Dinosaur Coast, and development of the Rotunda Museum in Scarborough have 51 \nall given the regional geology additional importance.  52 \n 53 \nThe Lias Group (Hettangian to Toarcian age; 199.6 to 175.6 Ma), exposed in the well 54 \nknown coastal sections, is illustrated by the fully cored Felixkirk Borehole, located at 55 \nthe western margin of the outcrop, and is one of the best examples of shallow marine 56 \nsedimentation in an epeiric shelf-sea setting. It comprises two large-scale, upward 57 \ncoarsening cycles, namely the Redcar Mudstone to Staithes Sandstone cycle, 58 \nfollowed by the Cleveland Ironstone to Blea Wyke Sandstone cycle. Within this broad 59 \npattern, smaller scale transgressive-regressive cycles are described from 60 \nstratigraphically expanded and reduced successions. Detailed ammonite 61 \nbiostratigraphy provides a finely calibrated temporal framework to study the 62 \nvariations in sedimentation, which include storm-generated limestones and 63 \nsandstones (\u2018tempestites\u2019) interbedded with mudstone deposited during fair-weather 64 \nperiods. Hemipelagic mud, occasionally organic-rich, reflects deeper-water anoxic 65 \nevents that may indicate a response to global climate change. 66 \n 67 \nIn cores, the tempestite beds (Hettangian to Sinemurian) are characterized by sharp 68 \nbases that, at outcrop, are often masked by downward penetrating burrows. Cyclicity 69 \non a centimetre scale in the overlying Pliensbachian \u2018Banded Shales\u2019 may be the 70 \nresult of orbitally induced, climatic cycles. Gradational upward coarsening to the 71 \nStaithes Sandstone Formation marks a transition to sand-rich tempestite deposits, 72 \ncharacterised by low angle and swaley cross-lamination, interbedded with sand-73 \nstarved units (striped siltstones). The sands were probably deposited from sediment-74 \nladen, storm-surge and ebb currents in inner- and mid-shelf settings; the sandy 75 \nsubstrate was, at some levels, extensively bioturbated by deposit feeding organisms 76 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 3\nthat produced a spectacular range of trace fossil assemblages characteristic of 77 \nshoreface, inner-, mid-, and outer-shelf settings. Intrabasinal tectonics was a 78 \ncontrolling factor during deposition of both the Staithes Sandstone and the overlying 79 \nCleveland Ironstone (Late Pliensbachian). The influx of sand is attributed to 80 \nhinterland uplift and increased sediment flux. More marked intraformational uplift 81 \nduring deposition of the Cleveland Ironstone is manifested in a much attenuated 82 \nsuccession in the west of the basin (Felixkirk); southwards, towards the Market 83 \nWeighton High, the Pecten\/Main Seam oversteps unconformably onto progressively 84 \nolder beds to rest on the lower part of the Redcar Mudstone Formation. Ironstone, in 85 \nthe form of berthierine ooids and sideritic mud, was deposited during 5-6 cycles (in 86 \ncoastal exposures) of high sea-level stands that cut off siliciclastic influx from the low-87 \ngradient hinterland; regressive, upward-shoaling intervals are marked by 88 \ninterbedded, bioturbated siltstone and fine-grained sandstone.   89 \n 90 \nThe Toarcian succession (Whitby Mudstone and Blea Wyke Sandstone formations) 91 \ncontinues the second upward coarsening cycle in response to increased subsidence, 92 \nrising sea-level, and an influx of siliciclastic sand. Oxygenated, open marine mud was 93 \ndeposited during the initial deepening phase, followed by bituminous mud, attributed 94 \nto ocean-water stratification and the establishment of anoxic bottom conditions; in the 95 \nwest of the basin an upward shoaling sequence suggests that water depths were not 96 \nas great. Recent research on the geochemistry and stable isotope signatures across 97 \nthis early Toarcian interval indicates a widespread, global anoxic event, possibly 98 \nattributed to the release of methane hydrate on the ocean floor. The Alum Shale 99 \nMember represents increasingly oxygenated bottom conditions and an upward 100 \ncoarsening motif with passage to the Blea Wyke Sandstone Formation, which is 101 \npreserved only in the Peak Trough, an actively subsiding graben. Basin uplift 102 \naccompanied by gentle folding in late Toarcian to Aalenian times removed much of 103 \nthe late Toarcian succession so that the Middle Jurassic Dogger Formation 104 \n(Aalenian), a complex, condensed, shallow water unit rests unconformably on beds 105 \nas low as the Alum Shale over much of the Basin.  106 \n 107 \nDeep boreholes and revision mapping by the BGS in the west of the outcrop have 108 \nallowed a fuller, basin-wide synthesis of the palaeoenvironments and the influence of 109 \nintra-Jurassic tectonics during Mid- to Late Jurassic times. During Mid-Jurassic times 110 \nthe low-lying, paralic coastal plain, typified by braided and meandering fluvial 111 \nsystems and lacustrine deposits was invaded by marine incursions from the south 112 \nand east. Each transgressive event was different in its geographical penetration 113 \nacross the coastal plain, resulting in varied lithofacies and palaeoenvironments 114 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 4\nincluding ooidal ironstone and lime mud (Eller Beck Formation), peloid and ooid 115 \ncarbonate shoals (Lebberston Member), and tidal sand bars, pelloidal limestones and 116 \nnearshore marine muds (Scarborough Formation). Trace fossils, including dinosaur 117 \nfootprints, and macro-plant fossils tell us much about the palaeoenvironments on the 118 \ncoastal plain, during this time interval (175.6 Ma \u2013 164.7 Ma) that was characterised 119 \nby a warm, seasonal climate. 120 \n 121 \nThe basin wide transgression and marked global sea-level rise represented by the 122 \nCornbrash Formation, marks deposition in a shallow marine environment during the 123 \nCallovian, followed by sand (Osgodby Formation) and deeper water muds (Oxford 124 \nClay Formation) that spread northwards from the East Midlands over the Market 125 \nWeighton High during the Oxfordian. Subsequent shallowing of the basin resulted in 126 \nthe establishment of a carbonate\/siliciclastic platform typified by ooidal shoals, coral 127 \npatch reefs and sponge spicule-rich marine sands (Corallian Group). Their complex 128 \nsedimentation pattern was influenced by local infra-Oxfordian tectonics related to the 129 \nHowardian-Flamborough Fault Belt. Although the Ampthill Clay and Kimmeridge Clay 130 \nformations, the latter representing the most important regional hydrocarbon source 131 \nrock, are not well-exposed, recent boreholes in the Cleveland Basin have allowed a 132 \nmuch better understanding of the hemi-pelagic marine environment (both oxic and 133 \nanoxic) during this phase of sedimentation which marks a global sea-level rise.  134 \nAlthough well-studied by world standards, the Jurassic sediments of the Cleveland 135 \nBasin continue to throw up surprises and advances in our understanding of the Earth 136 \nas a dynamic system over a period of about 30 million years. These studies have 137 \ndirectly and indirectly influenced our understanding of the Earth as a system, and 138 \nhave played an important role in educating non-specialists, undergraduates and 139 \nprofessional geologists over many decades.  140 \n 141 \n 142 \n 143 \n 144 \n 145 \n 146 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 5\nThe Jurassic rocks of the Cleveland Basin (Yorkshire) have been a focus of 147 \ngeological research since the 19th century, with studies by William Smith, his 148 \nnephew John Phillips (1829), George Young and John Bird (1822), Martin Simpson 149 \n(1884) and the Survey geologist Charles Fox-Strangways (1992, 1915), to name but 150 \na few. Throughout the 20th century the excellent coastal exposures have acted as a 151 \nmagnet for palaeontologists, stratigraphers, sedimentologists and geochemists, as a 152 \nnatural geological laboratory, and their study was given additional impetus in the later 153 \npart of the 20th and early 21st centuries by their analogy with hydrocarbon reservoir 154 \nand source rocks in the North Sea Basin. 155 \n 156 \nThe Jurassic of Yorkshire (Fig. 1) was treated to an authoritative review by past 157 \nYGS President Professor John Hemingway (Hemingway 1974) and has been the 158 \nsubject of a number of excellent regional summaries and guides (Black 1934b; 159 \nRawson & Wright 1992, 1996, 2000; Cope 2006). Many of these publications 160 \nfocussed on the superb coastal sections so, in my YGS Presidential addresses 161 \n(2005, 2006), summarized here, I aimed to present an overview of Jurassic 162 \nsedimentation in the Cleveland Basin, including relatively recent and unpublished 163 \ndata from the western margin of the basin, an area often overlooked. With such a 164 \nwealth of scientific publications on these fascinating rocks, I have only been able to 165 \nfocus on key topics, but I hope this paper will provide an up-to-date overview of the 166 \ngeology that will stimulate further research into outstanding problems. 167 \n 168 \n1. STRUCTURAL SETTING 169 \n 170 \nThe Cleveland Basin in Jurassic times formed part of a system of shallow epeiric 171 \nseas and small extensional tectonic basins, linked via the Sole Pit Basin (a half-172 \ngraben structure) to the North Sea Basin (Fig. 2; Zeigler 1982).  The Cleveland Basin 173 \nwas relatively small, and was bounded to the north-east by the Mid-North Sea High 174 \nand to the west by the Pennine High. To the south lay the East Midlands Shelf, the 175 \nnorthern part of which comprised the Market Weighton High (MWH) (Kent 1955), 176 \nwhich remained as a relatively stable unfolded block, probably underlain by a granite 177 \nintrusion (Bott et al. 1978; Donato 1993) and characterized by reduced rates of 178 \nsedimentation throughout the Jurassic. The MWH is an asymmetrical structure over 179 \nwhich subsidence and sedimentation rates were reduced; it separated rapid 180 \nsubsidence and higher sedimentation rates to the north, in the Cleveland Basin, from 181 \nmore gradual subsidence to the south in the Lincolnshire area of the East Midlands 182 \nShelf (Kent 1955, 1974). 183 \n 184 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 6\nThe Mid North Sea High underwent tilting to the southwest in Mid Jurassic 185 \ntimes, probably in response to doming associated with the Forties-Piper Volcanic 186 \nCentre in the central North Sea Basin (Sellwood & Hallam 1974; Zeigler 1982; 187 \nUnderhill & Partington 1993). Mid Jurassic sedimentation in the Cleveland Basin was 188 \ntherefore characterized by marine transgressions that advanced in a north-westerly 189 \ndirection across the Market Weighton High, and by progradation of fluvial and deltaic 190 \nsiliciclastics towards the south-east (Hemingway 1974). The shoreline depositional 191 \nlithofacies of the Lower Jurassic strata were removed following basin inversion and 192 \nerosion during the Neogene, but projection of lithofacies and thickness trends 193 \nsuggests that the Early Jurassic shoreline lay around the present-day northern 194 \nPennines and Southern Uplands (Fig. 2). 195 \n 196 \nAt the regional scale, the Cleveland Basin was affected by a number of 197 \nextensional faults and probable strike-slip fault complexes (Hemingway 1974; Kirby & 198 \nSwallow 1987) that roughly define the present\u2013day outcrop (Fig. 3). Some were 199 \nactive during Early and Mid Jurassic sedimentation (Milsom & Rawson 1989; Powell 200 \net al. 1992). To the south, the east-west trending Asenby\u2013Coxwold-Gilling Graben, 201 \nthe Helmsley-Filey Fault Belt and the Howardian-Flamborough Fault Belt (defining 202 \nthe Vale of Pickering) were intermittently active north of the Market Weighton High 203 \nduring Mid to Late Jurassic times (Kirby & Swallow 1987). The eastern margin of the 204 \nbasin is cut by north-trending structures, such as the Peak Trough and Peak Fault 205 \n(Milsom & Rawson 1989), the Cayton Bay Fault and the Whitby Fault. The Peak 206 \nTrough was active in Early Jurassic times and preserves a thicker sequence of Lower 207 \nJurassic rocks compared to the surrounding areas. Furthermore, the entire Cleveland 208 \nBasin was subjected to gentle folding and erosion in late Toarcian time, so that the 209 \nupper part of the Lias Group was eroded to increasingly lower stratigraphical levels 210 \ntowards the south and southeast of the basin (Black 1934a; Hemingway 1974). The 211 \nwestern margin of the present-day outcrop is marked by the north-trending Borrowby 212 \nGraben (Powell et al. 1992), which, like the Peak Trough, shows evidence of 213 \nsynsedimentary faulting during the Mid Jurassic. Less evident is the uplift of part of 214 \nthe western outcrop near Roulston Scar (Hambleton Hills) in the Oxfordian, resulting 215 \nin local erosion of the Oxford Clay (Powell et al.1992, fig. 16). A number of the major 216 \nbounding faults are known to have been active during the Cimmerian orogeny, 217 \nespecially the east-west trending Coxwold-Gilling and Howardian-Flamborough fault 218 \nbelts, which show extension in Oxfordian (Late Jurassic) times (Wright, 2009) and 219 \nrenewed movements in post-Cretaceous times (Kirby & Swallow 1987; Starmer 220 \n1995). Petrographic and fission-track analysis suggest that the Middle Jurassic 221 \nsediments were buried to a depth of about 2 to 3km (Hemingway & Riddler 1982; 222 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 7\nGreen 1986; Bray et al. 1992), prior to inversion and north-south compression during 223 \nthe latest Cretaceous to Neogene. The latter resulted in formation of the complex 224 \neast-west trending Cleveland Anticline (Fig. 3) and subsidiary folds (e.g. the Lockton 225 \nAnticline, Goathland Syncline and Robin Hood\u2019s Bay Dome) that control the Jurassic 226 \noutcrop pattern of the North York Moors (Kent 1980a, 1980b).   227 \n 228 \n2. PALEOGEOGRAPHY 229 \n 230 \nThe palaeogeography of the Cleveland Basin is less well known during the Early 231 \nJurassic (Lias Group; 199.6 to 175.6 Ma) than at later times.  With notable 232 \nexceptions such as the London Platform, the region then formed part of the broad 233 \nepeiric sea that covered much of England and Wales and much of western Scotland 234 \n(Cope et al. 1992; Scrutton & Powell 2006; Fig. 2). During sea-level low stands (e.g. 235 \nlate Pliensbachian), however, clastic sediments may have been derived from an 236 \nemergent Pennine-Caledonian High. Lias Group \u2018background\u2019 sediments mostly 237 \ncomprise mudstones, but regional variations in interbedded coarser grained 238 \nbioclastic carbonate and siliciclastic sediments, ranging from carbonate dominated in 239 \nsouthern Britain (e.g. Blue Lias) to siliciclastic, storm-dominated sediments in the 240 \nCleveland Basin, suggest a northerly source area for the siliciclastic sediments. This 241 \nmay have been the Pennine High or land areas in southern Scotland (Fig. 2).  242 \n 243 \nBy Mid Jurassic time, uplift of the Mid North Sea High and the northern 244 \nsource areas noted above, coupled with uplift (possibly isostatic buoyancy) over the 245 \nMarket Weighton High, defined a more or less circular Cleveland Basin that was 246 \nlinked intermittently to the East Midlands Shelf to the south and the Sole Pit Basin to 247 \nthe south-east. Marine sedimentation continued in a broad epeiric shelf setting in 248 \nsouthern Britain and northwest Europe, but tectonic uplift and North Sea 249 \ndoming\/rifting resulted in fluvial progradation from the northwest and northeast (Knox 250 \net al. 1991) into the Cleveland Basin and deposition in paralic environments ranging 251 \nfrom river, lake and delta to estuarine. There is also evidence of \u2018Millstone Grit\u2019 252 \nquartz granules in the Aalenian sediments of the Howardian Hills, suggesting a 253 \nwestern Pennine source area. Only occasionally did sea-level rise result in marine 254 \ntransgression over the low-lying paralic hinterland.  These brief marine 255 \ntransgressions advanced generally northwestwards (Knox 1973; Parsons 1977) over 256 \nthe Market Weighton High, and except for the mid-Bajocian sea-level high 257 \n(ammonite-bearing Scarborough Formation), they did not extend to the northwest of 258 \nthe present-day outcrop (Fig. 4c). 259 \n 260 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 8\nRapid (global) sea-level rise throughout Britain during the early Callovian 261 \nresulted in partial drowning of the Cleveland Basin and widespread marine 262 \nsedimentation over northern Britain (Fig 8a). Fully marine ammonite faunas indicate 263 \nconnection with the faunal provinces of southern Britain. The Market Weighton High 264 \nstill influenced sedimentation in the region, however, resulting in thinner and 265 \ndistinctive marine calcareous sands during the Callovian (164.7-161.2 Ma) compared 266 \nto muds on the East Midlands Shelf. Sand was mostly derived from the northwest 267 \n(Wright 1977), but tectonics resulted in depositional hiatuses and much reworking of 268 \nsediment during the Callovian, prior to sea level rise that was characterized by the 269 \nnorthwards development of deeper water muds (upper Oxford Clay) across the 270 \nMarket Weighton High in the early Oxfordian.  During the late Early Oxfordian to early 271 \nLate Oxfordian, sedimentation in the Cleveland Basin was again distinct from the 272 \narea south of the Market Weighton High (Rawson & Wright 2000, fig. 3c).  273 \nSubsidence rates kept pace with sea-level rise and resulted in deposition of 274 \ndistinctive Corallian Group sediments, a complex suite of marine siliceous sands, 275 \nspiculites, ooidal shoals, micritic limestone and coral\/algal patch reefs (Blake & 276 \nHuddleston 1877; Wilson 1936, 1949; Wright 1972, 1983). This second phase of 277 \nbasin inversion (relative to the gently subsiding East Midland Shelf) resulted in 278 \nshallower water sedimentation coeval with deeper water muds of the West Walton 279 \nFormation and Ampthill Clay on the East Midland Shelf and the Seeley Formation in 280 \nthe Sole Pit Basin (Fig. 7). It was not until mid late Oxfordian times that increased 281 \nsubsidence and rising sea-level allowed the mud lithofacies of the Ampthill Clay to 282 \nspread northward from the Vale of Pickering area (Cox & Richardson 1982). Finally, 283 \na major worldwide sea level rise during the Kimmeridgian (Hallam 1988; Haq et al. 284 \n1988; Herbin et al. 1991) resulted in deeper water hemipelagic sedimentation over 285 \nwide areas of present day Britain, by which time the Cleveland area was no longer an 286 \nactive and distinct tectono-depositional basin.   287 \n 288 \nRelative sea-level changes expressed within the Jurassic succession of the 289 \nCleveland Basin are often not in accord with global patterns (Hallam 1988; Haq 1988; 290 \nHallam 2001); there is good correspondence with global sea-level rise in the early 291 \nHettangian (Calcareous Shales, Redcar Mudstone Formation), early Pliensbachian 292 \n(Pyritous\/Banded Shales; Redcar Mudstone Formation); early Toarcian (Grey 293 \nShales\/Mulgrave Shale members; Whitby Mudstone Formation) and late Oxfordian 294 \n(Weymouth Member, Oxford Clay). However, the early Sinemurian, early-late 295 \nBajocian and mid-Callovian global sea-level rises are not well expressed. This is due 296 \nto the effects of local and regional intra-plate tectonics which resulted in hinterland 297 \nuplift and local basinal subsidence, increased sediment flux and regressive 298 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 9\nsiliciclastic sedimentation (e.g. Ravenscar Group and Osgodby Formation in the 299 \nCleveland Basin).    300 \n 301 \n3. BIOSTRATIGRAPHICAL AND CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHICAL FRAMEWORK 302 \n 303 \nAmmonites have traditionally provided the biostratigraphical and 304 \nchronostratigraphical framework for the Jurassic of the Cleveland Basin, although 305 \ntheir absence from the paralic and fluvio-deltaic lithofacies of the Middle Jurassic 306 \nRavenscar Group has resulted in an interesting debate on the timing of basin fill 307 \nduring the Bajocian and Bathonian (Leeder & Nami 1979; Riding & Wright 1989; 308 \nButler et al. 2005). 309 \n 310 \nAmmonite zonation is precise and is based on the benchmark work of Arkell 311 \n(1933, 1945) and later workers. Up to 65 ammonite zones have been recognized in 312 \nthe Cleveland Basin (Figs 5, 6, 7), together with many subzones that allow fine 313 \ntemporal resolution and correlation throughout Britain (Buckman 1909-30; Dean et al. 314 \n1961; Howarth 1955, 1962, 1973; Cope et al. 1980a, b; Callomon 1995). The 315 \nduration of ammonite zones is difficult to determine as rates of extinction and the 316 \nincoming and acme of new species are likely to have varied through Jurassic time. 317 \nAs a common \u2018rule of thumb\u2019, the duration of an ammonite zone was estimated to be 318 \nabout 1 million year (Ma). However, where recent radiometric ages have been 319 \ndetermined based on U-Pb and 40Ar\/39Ar ratios, the duration of Jurassic ammonite 320 \nzones has been estimated to be between 0.4 and 1.6 Ma (Palfy & Smith 2000), 321 \nalthough this duration has been questioned for the Toarcian by McArthur et al. 322 \n(2000), who consider the variation in duration to be much greater. 323 \n 324 \nAmmonites typical of the Boreal (northern) and Tethyan (southern) realms are 325 \npresent in the Cleveland basin as a result of periodic connection between these two 326 \npalaeobiogeographical provinces via the Faeroes Rift, the Anglo-Welsh Basin, the 327 \nParis Basin and the open Tethys Ocean located to the south (Cope 2006). Howarth 328 \n(1976) recognized the incoming of Tethyan forms during the Early Jurassic, 329 \nSinemurian\u2013Aalenian interval. At other times, Boreal faunas were dominant, 330 \nespecially during the Callovian transgression and the Oxfordian, and are typified by 331 \ncardioceratid and kosmoceratid ammonites (Cope 2006). Of considerable note is the 332 \nselection of the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the 333 \nPliensbachian Stage at Wine Haven, Robin Hood\u2019s Bay (Meister et al. 2006), at a 334 \nlevel interpreted as coinciding with a major deepening of the sea manifested in the 335 \nlower part of the Pyritous Shales Member (Redcar Mudstone Formation, Lias Group). 336 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 10\n 337 \nThe ammonite zonal scheme in relation to the chronostratigraphy and 338 \nlithostratigraphy of the Cleveland Basin and correlative strata in the Sole Pit Basin 339 \nand East Midlands Shelf is outlined in Figures 5, 6 and 7. The zonal scheme is based 340 \non the Boreal ammonite distribution, most commonly used in the UK; in this paper 341 \nammonite zones are used as chronozones, so their names are capitalized using the 342 \nStandard Zone terminology species name (e.g. Planorbis Zone), but for ease of 343 \nreference to the genus and species (e.g. Psiloceras planorbis), the names are written 344 \nas biozones in Figures 5, 6 and 7.  Ogg et al. (2008) have revised the Jurassic time 345 \nscale so that the geochronological age of the base of the Jurassic is 199.6 Ma and 346 \nthe base of the Cretaceous is 145.5 Ma, a duration of 54 million years, considerably 347 \nshorter than earlier estimates of 205.7 Ma (base) and 142.0 Ma (top) and 63.7 years 348 \nduration (Gradstein & Ogg 1996). However, as a result of Late Cimmerian (latest 349 \nJurassic to pre-Cretaceous) erosion (Rawson & Riley 1982), the youngest beds 350 \npreserved in the Cleveland Basin belong to the Pectinatus Zone, c.151 Ma (Ogg et 351 \nal. 2008), or possibly the higher Pallasioides Zone (Herbin et al. 1991) (Fig. 7).   352 \n 353 \nThe standard north-west European sequence of Lower Jurassic ammonite 354 \nchronozones and sub-chronozones for the Hettangian, Sinemurian, part of the 355 \nPliensbachian and Toarcian stages has been recognized in the Lias succession in 356 \nwell-exposed coastal sections (Buckman 1909-30, 1915; Bairstow 1969; Howarth 357 \n1955, 1962, 1973, 2002).  Most of these zones have also been identified in the 358 \nFelixkirk cores (Fig. 9) (Ivimey-Cook & Powell 1991, fig. 2; Powell et al. 1992). The 359 \nammonite zonation for the Middle and Upper Jurassic is based on Cope et al. 360 \n(1980a, b), especially the work of Wright (1980).  361 \n 362 \nOther fossil groups, particularly microfossils, have aided biostratigraphical 363 \nzonation and correlation, especially with the North Sea Basin and for the paralic and 364 \nmarginal marine successions where ammonites are not present. Bate (1964, 1965, 365 \n1967) used ostracods to correlate thin transgressive marine units of the Middle 366 \nJurassic Ravenscar Group with the fully marine succession of the East Midlands 367 \nShelf.  Although less precisely resolved, dinoflagellate cysts were used by Woollam & 368 \nRiding (1980) to establish up to 16 zones calibrated against the standard north-west 369 \nEuropean ammonite scheme (76 zones). Dinoflagellates have enabled correlation of 370 \nthe Middle Jurassic succession in the Cleveland Basin with the southern North Sea 371 \n(Hancock & Fisher 1981) and northern North Sea (Butler et al. 2005), and have 372 \nhelped to resolve the age of the Bajocian to Bathonian succession onshore (Riding & 373 \nWright 1989). 374 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 11\n 375 \n4. LITHOSTRATIGRAPHY OF THE CLEVELAND BASIN 376 \n 377 \nA brief outline of the lithostratigraphy of the Jurassic succession is presented in this 378 \nsection (Figs 5, 6, 7), and the former nomenclature is shown in Tables 1 and 2. 379 \nFurther details of the succession are presented in later thematic sections (Section 5). 380 \n 381 \nLower Jurassic sediments comprise the Lias Group (Fig 8b) of Hettangian to 382 \nToarcian age, with a maximum thickness of 454 m; subdivisions are based on Powell 383 \n(1984), Knox (1984), Ivimey-Cook & Powell (1991), Howard (1985) and Rawson & 384 \nWright (1992). Lias Group sediments (Figs 5, 9) rest conformably on the Upper 385 \nTriassic (Rhaetian) Penarth Group (Benfield & Warrington 1988; Ivimey-Cook & 386 \nPowell 1991). Black, anoxic, fissile mudstones of the Westbury Formation and the 387 \noverlying grey-green smectitic claystones of the Cotham Member (Lilstock 388 \nFormation), both formations of the Penarth Group, were deposited in brackish and 389 \nrestricted lagoons and are dominated by monospecific faunas. The first truly marine 390 \ninterbedded limestones\/mudstone beds typical of the Lias Group occur about 10 m 391 \nbelow the first marine ammonite fauna represented by Psiloceras planorbis (Ivimey-392 \nCook & Powell 1991), which marks the base of the Hettangian Stage in the region 393 \n(Fig. 9). However, the GSSP for the base of the Jurassic System and the Hettangian 394 \nStage is placed at the incoming of Psiloceras spelae in the mid-European Tethyan 395 \nrealm, slightly earlier than the \u2018planorbis event\u2019 in the UK (Page & Bloos 1998; Lucas 396 \n& Tanner 2007). 397 \n    398 \n 399 \n4.1 Lower Jurassic Succession 400 \n 401 \nThe Lias Group (Figs 5, 9) in the Cleveland Basin is divided into five formations 402 \n(Powell 1984), described here in ascending order. The Redcar Mudstone 403 \nFormation (c. 283 m thick) forms the greater part of the group, and consists of clay 404 \nand silt grade siliciclastic sediments interbedded with carbonate-rich shell beds of 405 \nvarious types, concretion beds and fine-to medium-grained siliciclastic beds.  The 406 \ncoarse-grained beds enable subdivision of the formation into five informal members 407 \non the coast (Tate & Blake 1876; Fox-Strangways 1892; Fox-Strangways & Barrow 408 \n1915; Buckman 1915; Hemingway 1974; Knox et al. 1991; van Buchem & McCave 409 \n1989; Hesselbo & Jenkyns 1998; van Buchem & Knox 1998).  In upward sequence, 410 \nthese are the Calcareous Shales (with numerous oyster-rich limestone beds), 411 \nSiliceous Shales (bioturbated, sand-rich beds), Pyritous Shales (pyritous nodules and 412 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 12\nbeds of concretionary siderite), Banded Shales (regular alternations of siltstone and 413 \nmudstone beds) and Ironstone Shales (iron-rich, silty laminations). However, in the 414 \nwest of the basin, the distinction between the last three members is less apparent. 415 \nThere, a gradational upward coarsening trend within the Pyritous\/Banded\/Ironstone 416 \ninterval (lower Pliensbachian) is clearly shown on the gamma-ray logs of the Felixkirk 417 \nBorehole [SE 4835 8576] (Figs 1, 9; Powell & Ivimey-Cook 1991; Powell et al. 1992). 418 \nThe formation is considerably thinner (194 m) in the west of the basin. The marked 419 \n\u2018saw-tooth\u2019 expression of the gamma-ray and sonic geophysical logs in the 420 \nCalcareous Shales and Siliceous Shales members (Fig. 9) is due to the intercalation 421 \nof fine-grained \u2018background\u2019 sediments (mudstone) and coarse-grained bioclastic or 422 \nsand-rich beds that form the characteristic \u2018benches\u2019 in these Hettangian to 423 \nSinemurian strata in Robin Hood\u2019s Bay (Fig 10a). The origin of these beds is 424 \nconsidered in Section 5. 425 \n 426 \nThe Ironstone Shales pass gradationally upward with increasing sand-grade 427 \nsediment to the Staithes Sandstone Formation (c. 30 m) (Hemingway 1974; 428 \nHoward 1985). The formation forms a coastal cliff and inland scarp feature, and 429 \nconsists of grey, yellow weathering, fine- to medium-grained sandstone and siltstone 430 \nof late Pliensbachian age. On the coast, at Staithes, the upper part of the formation 431 \nhas a higher ratio of siltstone to sandstone than in the western outcrop. Sandstone 432 \nbeds are often characterized by low-angle, wavy and hummocky cross-bedding 433 \n(Howard 1985), and the beds are often heavily bioturbated with a rich suite of 434 \nichnofossils (Figs 10c,f) (Knox et al. 1991).  435 \n 436 \nThe Cleveland Ironstone Formation (CIF, c. 28 m thick) and the underlying 437 \nStaithes Sandstone Formation form a marked mappable feature inland, hence the 438 \nearlier term \u2018Middle Lias\u2019 for these two formations. The formation, on the coast, is 439 \nsubdivided into a lower Penny Nab Member (Howard, 1984), including five mineable  440 \nironstone seams (in upward sequence: the Osmotherly, Avicula, Raisdale and Two 441 \nFoot seams). The overlying, the Kettleness Member, which includes the Pecten and 442 \nMain Seam, unconformably oversteps successively younger Lias Group units to the 443 \nsouth towards Market Weighton, and to the west (Fig. 16). 444 \n Ironstone represents only a small part (c. 30%) of the CIF, which consists of 445 \ngrey mudstone and sandy mudstone interbedded with sideritic and berthierine 446 \n(chamosite)-rich ooidal ironstone (Sorby 1857; Lamplugh 1920; Hemingway 1951; 447 \nWhitehead et al. 1952; Chowns 1968; Howard 1985). Intervening siliciclastic beds 448 \nshow fine parallel lamination, wave ripple lamination and erosional gutter casts 449 \n(Greensmith et al. 1980; Rawson et al. 1983; Howard 1985). The formation is 450 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 13\nthickest at Staithes, but thins to the south and west where the siliciclastic interbeds 451 \nare reduced in thickness, and as a result of an intraformational unconformity below 452 \nthe Pecten Seam (Fig. 9), only three seams including the Main Seam are present at 453 \nFelixkirk, with a total thickness of 9m (Powell et al. 1992). This is  a result of the Main 454 \nSeam overlapping the Pecten Seam to rest with overstep on successively older 455 \nstrata to the south. In the Howardian Hills, the formation is only 2m thick (Chowns 456 \n1968)  457 \n 458 \nThe beds informally known as the \u2018Upper Lias\u2019 comprise the Whitby 459 \nMudstone Formation and the Blea Wyke Sandstone Formation (Rastall 1905; 460 \nPowell 1984; Knox 1984).  The Whitby Mudstone (c. 105 m thick) consists 461 \npredominantly of grey to dark grey mudstone and siltstone with abundant shelly 462 \nfossils at some levels. Uplift and erosion prior to deposition of the Dogger Formation 463 \nin Aalenian times has resulted in the full succession being preserved only in the 464 \nsyndepositional Peak Trough (Milsom & Rawson 1989), where five members are 465 \npresent (Knox 1984). The Grey Shale Member (c. 13.5 m max.) comprises the 466 \neponymous silty mudstone with beds of calcareous siderite concretions. A change to 467 \nmore anoxic bottom conditions is recorded in the overlying Mulgrave Shale Member 468 \n(formerly Jet Rock Member) (Rawson & Wright 1992) (c. 31 m max.), which 469 \nconsists of fissile, bituminous, dark grey mudstone with abundant ammonites. This 470 \nunit was long exploited for the mineral jet (dense, water-logged, araucarian wood), 471 \nmined on the coast and sporadically inland for the manufacture of jewellery 472 \n(Hemingway 1974, p.174). The Alum Shale Member (max. 37 m) is generally less 473 \nfossiliferous and comprises grey silty mudstone with bands of calcareous and siderite 474 \nconcretions, and bands of phosphatic nodules in the upper part; the shales were 475 \nformerly worked in large quarries for alum used for \u2018fulling\u2019 wool and in chemical 476 \nindustries (Gad et al. 1969; Hemingway 1974). The Middle Jurassic Dogger 477 \nFormation rests unconformably on this unit over much of the Cleveland Basin (e.g. in 478 \nthe Felixkirk Borehole; Fig. 9). Where the full succession is preserved, the upper part 479 \nof the Alum Shale Member shows a gradual coarsening upward trend to the overlying 480 \nPeak Shale Member (Knox 1984). The upward coarsening trend continues into the 481 \nFox Cliff Siltstone Member, comprising muddy siltstone with beds of calcareous 482 \nand sideritic concretions and with small phosphatic nodules. The coarse-grained end-483 \nmember of this trend is the Blea Wyke Sandstone Formation (18 m max.), 484 \ncomprising grey, mud-rich sandstone (Grey Sandstone Member) passing up to 485 \n\u2018cleaner\u2019 yellow sandstone (Yellow Sandstone Member).  When traced southwards 486 \ntowards the Market Weighton High (MWH), pre-Dogger erosion cuts downwards 487 \nthrough the Whitby Mudstone so that the Dogger Formation rests on the Mulgrave 488 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 14\nShale Member in the Brown Moor Borehole (Gaunt et al. 1980; Fig 1), located north 489 \nof the MWH. At Market Weighton, the highest Lower Jurassic strata below the sub-490 \nCretaceous unconformity comprise sandstone with ironstone nodules attributable to 491 \neither the Cleveland Ironstone Formation or Staithes Sandstone Formation (Whitham 492 \nin Scrutton & Powell 2006). 493 \n 494 \nIn the Southern North Sea Basin, the Lias Group is between 200 and 300 m 495 \nthick, but reaches up to 820 m in the Sole Pit Basin. It thins northwards towards the 496 \nMid North Sea High (Lott & Knox 1994). Formations offshore are recognized largely 497 \nfrom their geophysical wireline log characteristics (Fig. 5), but are broadly equivalent 498 \nto the onshore equivalents. Hence, in upwards sequence, the Penda and Offa 499 \nformations are equivalent to the Redcar Mudstone Formation, the ferruginous and 500 \nsandy Ida Formation is equivalent to the Cleveland Ironstone and Staithes 501 \nSandstone formations, and the Cerdic Formation is equivalent to the Whitby 502 \nMudstone Formation. As a result of latest-Toarcian folding, the sandy late Toarcian 503 \nPhillips Member of the southern North Sea Basin, broadly equivalent to the upward 504 \ncoarsening Blea Wyke Formation, was removed by erosion and is identified only in a 505 \nfew wells (e.g. 47\/3b-4; 42\/29-1), possibly restricted to extensional rifts similar to the 506 \nbetter known Peak Trough (Lott & Knox 1994). 507 \n 508 \n 509 \n4.2 Middle Jurassic Succession 510 \n 511 \nThe Dogger Formation, up to 13 m thick (Hemingway 1974), is Aalenian in age 512 \n(Black 1934a; Parsons in Cope et al. 1980b). It rests unconformably on the Lias 513 \nGroup, generally on the Alum Shale Member but disconformably on the Blea Wyke 514 \nSandstone (Knox 1984) within the Peak Trough. In coastal sections, the marine 515 \nDogger Formation is generally represented by thin ferruginous sandstone, locally rich 516 \nin berthierine and calcareous ooids. Intense bioturbation is common, and soft-517 \nsediment burrows penetrate downward into the underlying, mudstone (Alum Shale). 518 \nNear Whitby (East Cliff), for example, the Dogger, c. 1 m thick, consists of highly 519 \nbioturbated, ferruginous sandstone with rounded black phosphatic pebbles, locally 520 \nwith endolithic borings.  Inland, the Dogger Formation is a lithologically 521 \nheterogeneous unit, comprising conglomerate, sandstone, mudstone, ooidal and 522 \nbioclastic limestone and ironstone, and including marine and brackish lithofacies.  523 \nWhen traced southwards towards the northern margin of the Market Weighton High, 524 \nthe Dogger Formation rests unconformably (overstep) on older units of the Lias 525 \nGroup down to the Redcar Mudstone Formation (Hemingway, 1974). 526 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 15\n 527 \nThe majority of the Middle Jurassic (Aalenian to Bathonian) succession is 528 \nrepresented by the Ravenscar Group (240 m max.) (Smithson 1934, 1942; 529 \nHemingway 1949; Hemingway & Knox 1973; Lott & Humphreys 1994; Cox & 530 \nSumbler 2002) comprising mostly paralic, including fluvial and lacustrine, lithofacies, 531 \nand three distinctive transgressive marine units (Fig. 6): the Eller Beck Formation, the 532 \nLebberston Member of the Cloughton Formation, and the Scarborough Formation. 533 \nThe Ravenscar Group thins rapidly southwards to 57 m in the Fordon Borehole [TA 534 \n058 758], south of the Vale of Pickering (Fig. 8b), and a similar thickness was 535 \nrecorded in the Brown Moor Borehole (see below).  536 \nThe paralic units in the succession (formerly known as \u2018Estuarine\u2019 or \u2018Deltaic\u2019 537 \nunits; Table 2) comprise the Saltwick, Cloughton and Scalby formations.  The 538 \nSaltwick Formation (57 m max.) generally overlies the Dogger Formation, but rests 539 \nunconformably on the Lias Group (Alum Shales) where the Dogger is absent due to 540 \nerosion or non-deposition. It consists mostly of medium- to coarse-grained, cross-541 \nbedded channel sandstones with fine-grained, planar laminated and ripple cross-542 \nlaminated sandstone and micaceous mudstone; drifted plant fragments and in situ 543 \nplant rootlets are common in some beds. The Eller Beck Formation (c. 8 m max.) 544 \nrepresents the first transgressive marine incursion that advanced northwestwards 545 \nacross the basin; it comprises sandstone rich in berthierine ooids, ooidal ironstone 546 \nand mudstone (Barrow 1877; Knox 1973). The overlying Cloughton Formation (85 547 \nm) is lithologically similar to the Saltwick Formation, but includes a marine 548 \nlimestone\/sandstone unit, the Lebberston Member (up to 9 m), which, where 549 \npresent in the south of the basin, divides the formation into a lower Sycarham 550 \nMember and an upper Gristhorpe Member. In southern coastal exposures, where 551 \nthe Lebberston Member comprises sandy ooidal limestone and calcareous 552 \nsandstone, it is know as the \u2018Millepore Bed\u2019 lithofacies. In the Hambleton and 553 \nHowardian Hills, it is more calcareous, and is referred to as the \u2018Whitwell Oolite\u2019 554 \nlithofacies (Richardson, 1912). When traced southwards to the Market Weighton 555 \nHigh (e.g. in the Brown Moor Borehole, Gaunt et al. 1980), the attenuated sandy 556 \nparalic Cloughton Formation succession (56 m thick) between the Eller Beck 557 \nFormation and the Scarborough Formation becomes more \u2018marine\u2019 in character, and 558 \nincludes 16 m of ooidal limestone (in 3 beds) and sandstone with bivalves and 559 \nscattered ooids.   560 \nThe Scarborough Formation (Bate 1965; Parsons 1977, 1980; Gowland & 561 \nRiding 1991; Butler et al. 2005), marks a major marine transgression over the whole 562 \nBasin in the early Bajocian. In the coastal type section at Hundale Point (Fig. 27) it is 563 \ndominated by mud- and sand-rich sediments with thin argillaceous limestones, 564 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 16\nsubdivided into seven members (Table 2; Gowland & Riding 1991). Ammonites such 565 \nas Dorsetensia and Teloceras, and marine palynomorphs in the Ravenscar Shale 566 \nMember, indicate the Humphriesianum Zone (late early Bajocian). In the coastal 567 \noutcrop, marine siliciclastic sediments with hummocky cross-bedding (e.g. at 568 \nRavenscar cliff) and thin silty limestones that yield bivalves (Gervillella, 569 \nPseudomontis, Trigonia, Astarte and Lopha), belemnites and sparse ammonites, 570 \ntogether with a diverse suite of shallow marine trace fossils including Rhizocorallium, 571 \nTeichichnus and U-shaped Diplocraterion (Hemingway 1974; Miller et al. 1984; 572 \nGowland & Riding 1991).This contrasts with the different succession in the western 573 \noutcrops of the Hambleton Hills (Table 2), where a lower unit, the Brandsby 574 \nRoadstone Member , comprising peloidal (faecal peloids) planar cross-bedded 575 \nlimestone, is overlain by medium-grained, fossiliferous sandstone, the Crinoid Grit 576 \nMember (Powell et al. 1992).  577 \n 578 \nA return to fluvio-deltaic and paralic lithofacies is marked by Scalby 579 \nFormation (c. 60 m) (Black, 1928; Leeder & Nami, 1979). At the base, the Moor Grit 580 \nMember consists of medium- to coarse-grained, locally pebbly, cross-bedded, 581 \nchannel sandstone unconformably overlying the Scarborough Formation. It passes 582 \ngradationally up to the Long Nab Member, which is chararcterised by micaceous 583 \nmudstone and finer-grained sandstone locally with abundant plant remains; channel 584 \nsandbodies are less common and smaller in size compared to those in the Moor Grit, 585 \nhence its former name the \u2018Level-bedded Series\u2019 (Hemingway 1974). 586 \n 587 \nThe biostratigraphical framework of the Ravenscar Group is poorly 588 \nconstrained. Based on ostracod faunas (Bate 1967), the marine Eller Beck Formation 589 \nand Lebberston Member are thought to be of late Aalenian-early Bajocian and early 590 \nBajocian age respectively, coeval wholly or in part with the Discites Zone of the 591 \nLincolnshire Limestone. Sparse ammonites collected from the Scarborough 592 \nFormation suggest the \u2018mid-Bajocian\u2019 Humphriesianum Zone (Romani to Blagdeni 593 \nsubzones) (Parsons 1977).  Correlation of the western inland succession with the 594 \ntypical coastal exposures is, however, tentative, and the Scarborough Formation in 595 \nthe Hambleton Hills may be representative of the early Sauzei Zone (Fig. 6; Parsons 596 \n1980). Fluvial and paralic parts of the succession contain few biostratigraphical 597 \nindicators, but given the ages indicated for the marine units, the Cloughton Formation 598 \nprobably spans the Discites, Laeviuscula and possibly Sauzei zones (Fig. 6; Cope et 599 \nal. 1980b).  The basal part of the Scalby Formation (Moor Grit Member) on the coast 600 \nhas yielded a dinoflagellate cyst assemblage of probable late Bajocian age (Riding & 601 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 17\nWright 1989); the overlying Long Nab Member ranges from late Bajocian in the lower 602 \npart to Bathonian in the upper.  603 \n 604 \nThe upper boundary of the Ravenscar Group is defined by the base of the 605 \nmarine Cornbrash Formation or, where absent, by the base of the Osgodby 606 \nFormation (Powell et al. 1992; Gaunt et al. 1980). The overlying marine succession 607 \nrepresents a condensed sequence of Callovian age (Wright 1977), equivalent to the 608 \nUpper Cornbrash of the succession on the East Midlands Shelf and southwards to 609 \nDorset (Page 1989). The latter author renamed the berthierine-rich limestone unit as 610 \nthe Fleet Member of the Abbotsbury Cornbrash Formation, but this name and earlier 611 \nterminology are used variably in Rawson and Wright (2000), and the traditional name 612 \nis preferred here (cf. Douglas & Arkell 1932).     613 \n   614 \nThe base of the Cornbrash Formation marks the base of the Callovian Stage 615 \n(Macrocephalus Zone) in the Cleveland Basin. The formation consists of oyster-rich 616 \nsandy limestone with berthierine ooids. This distinctive unit is about 1 m thick on the 617 \ncoast (Cayton Bay) and up to 3.6 m in Newtondale (Wright 1977; Page 1989), but is 618 \nabsent at Brown Moor on the northern flank of the Market Weighton High (Gaunt et 619 \nal. 1980). The Cornbrash Formation has not been positively identified in the 620 \nHambleton Hills, where the basal sandstone (Redcliff Rock Member) of the Osgodby 621 \nFormation rests directly on the Scalby Formation (Senior 1975; Powell et al. 1992). 622 \nThe formation is much thinner than the equivalent Upper Cornbrash of southern 623 \nEngland (Page 1989), where it forms a brashy (stoney) soil best suited to growing 624 \ncorn (hence its name).  The overlying Cayton Clay Formation (formerly \u2018Shales of 625 \nthe Cornbrash\u2019) consists of dark grey calcareous mudstone and siltstone with 626 \nphosphatic nodules; ammonites indicate the Herveyi Zone (Wright 1978; Rawson & 627 \nWright 2000). Recent boreholes (2009) at Knipe Point, near Osgodby, prove up to 4 628 \nm of Cayton Clay Formation overlying 1 m of Cornbrash limestone.  629 \n 630 \nSandstone and siltstone characterize the overlying Osgodby Formation 631 \n(Wright 1978) of Callovian age (Fig. 6).  In typical Yorkshire coast sections, the 632 \nformation was subdivided into the following members, in ascending order: Kellaways 633 \nRock (now the Redcliff Rock Member), Langdale Member and Hackness Rock 634 \nMember (Buckman 1913; Walker 1972; Wright 1968a, 1968b, 1978).  The 635 \nstratigraphy of the Callovian (and Oxfordian) rocks on the Cleveland Basin has been 636 \nrefined by Wright (1968a, 1977, 1978, 1983), particularly for the eastern part of the 637 \nBasin. Only the Redcliff Rock and the Hackness Rock are present in the Hambleton 638 \nHills, where the Osgodby Formation ranges in thickness from 20 to 23 m (Powell et 639 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 18\nal. 1992; Frost 1998), and at Brown Moor only 5.5 m of fine- to medium-grained, 640 \npoorly lithified, bioturbated sand with a marine fauna (belemnites and Kosmoceras) 641 \nare present. Wright\u2019s studies, and BGS re-surveys in the western part of the basin 642 \n(British Geological Survey 1992, 1994), have demonstrated two unconformities within 643 \nthe Callovian succession. At the base, the Redcliff Rock Member (Page 1989), 644 \nnamed after Red Cliff, Cayton Bay, ranges from 11.5 to 23 m in thickness and 645 \nconsists of orange, yellow and grey, fine- to medium-grained, thick-bedded 646 \nsandstone, locally with scattered berthierine ooids. Large bivalves and belemnites, 647 \noften preserved as decalcified moulds and casts, are conspicuous in some beds, 648 \nparticularly in the upper part of the member.  Some beds show cross-bedding and 649 \nthe rock is usually soft and decalcified at outcrop.  Vertical burrows and burrow-650 \nmottling are common in some beds.  Bivalves include the oysters Gryphaea dilobotes 651 \nand Liostrea sp., as well as Chlamys fibrosa, Meleagrinella braamburiensis, Trigonia 652 \nsp. and Unicardium sp.; rhynchonellid brachiopods are also present.  The Redcliff 653 \nRock has yielded ammonites indicating the Koenigi Zone (Page 1989) and is 654 \nequivalent in part to the Kellaways Clay Member of southern England. The Langdale 655 \nMember (Wright 1968a, 1978) at Red Cliff, Scarborough [TA 07 84] is locally cut out 656 \nbelow the unconformable Hackness Rock.  In the Hackness Hills, it consists of about 657 \n15 m of greenish brown, fine- to medium grained sandstone and siltstone, often 658 \nheavily bioturbated with sparse chamosite ooids and clay laminae. On the coast 659 \n(Castle Hill; Osgodby Nab) a hard, brown fine-grained sandstone bed is present at 660 \nthe base The bivalve fauna is  similar to that found in the underlying Redcliff Rock 661 \nMember, and belemnite guards are also common in places.  Ammonites include 662 \nspecies of Erymnoceras, Kosmoceras indicating the upper Coronatum Zone. The 663 \nsandstone members, together with the overlying Hackness Rock Member, are 664 \nequivalent in part to the Peterborough and Stewartby members of the Oxford Clay 665 \nsouth of the Market Weighton High (Cox et al. 1993). The Hackness Rock Member, 666 \nwhere present, is about 3 m thick, and consists of buff-grey siltstone with alternating 667 \nsoft and hard calcite-cemented bands; fossils include bivalves, belemnites and 668 \nsparse ammonites, the latter indicating the Athleta and Lamberti zones (Wright 1978; 669 \nPage 1989).  670 \n 671 \n4.3 Upper Jurassic Succession 672 \n 673 \nThe lithostratigraphy of the Upper Jurassic in the Cleveland Basin was established by 674 \nFox-Strangways et al. (1886) and Fox-Strangways (1892), and was later refined by 675 \nWright (1972, 1983, 1996a, 1996b, 2009), who formalized the nomenclature and 676 \nprovided a detailed chronostratigraphical framework based on ammonite zones (Fig. 677 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 19\n7).  The base of the Upper Jurassic is defined at the lower boundary of the Oxfordian 678 \nStage (Cope et al. 1980b), which corresponds to the base of the Oxford Clay 679 \nFormation in the Cleveland Basin. The youngest Jurassic strata in the Cleveland 680 \nBasin, the Kimmeridge Clay, belong to the Pectinatus Zone (151 Ma) or possibly the 681 \noverlying Pallasioides Zone of the Tithonian Stage (Herbin et al. 1991; Ogg et al. 682 \n2008). Later Kimmeridgian sediments were removed during the late Jurassic-early 683 \nCretaceous Cimmerian earth movements.   684 \n 685 \nThe Upper Jurassic rocks are wholly of marine origin and mark a continuation 686 \nof the major marine transgression that began during the Callovian Stage.  Eustatic 687 \nsea-level rise in north-west Europe (Hallam 1988; Haq et al. 1988) was interrupted 688 \nlocally by a regressive phase during the deposition of the Corallian Group, 689 \ncomprising carbonates and calcareous sandstones, but culminated in restricted, 690 \nbasinal environments with anoxic bottom-conditions during the deposition of the 691 \nbituminous Kimmeridge Clay. 692 \nThe Oxford Clay ranges in thickness from 0 to 44 m and consists of grey-693 \ngreen calcareous mudstone and silty mudstone. South of the Market Weighton High, 694 \nthe formation comprises three members, the Peterborough, Stewartby and 695 \nWeymouth members in upwards succession, but only the Weymouth Member of 696 \nearly Oxfordian age is present in the Cleveland Basin (Cox et al. 1993). The lithology 697 \nis more silt-rich compared to its occurrence on the East Midlands Shelf, where the 698 \nformation is about 70 m thick. In the Roulston Scar area of the Hambleton Hills, the 699 \nabsence of the Oxford Clay is the result of uplift and subsequent sub-marine erosion 700 \nof the Oxford Clay, and in places the underlying Hackness Rock, prior to deposition 701 \nof the Lower Calcareous Grit.  702 \n 703 \nAn abundant ammonite fauna has been collected from a number of levels in 704 \nthe Oxford Clay of the Hambleton Hills, and indicates the Mariae Zone, 705 \nScarburgense Subzone (Cox in Powell et al. 1992). Other sections near the top of 706 \nthe formation have yielded small casts of Cardioceras praecordatum Douvill\u00e9, 707 \nproving the later Praecordatum Subzone.   708 \n 709 \nThe Corallian Group ranges in thickness from 70 m to 150 m and 710 \npredominantly comprises ooidal and micritic limestone and calcareous, spiculitic, 711 \nfine-grained sandstone. The group is subdivided into three formations (Wright 1972, 712 \n1983, 1996a, 1996b) separated by disconformities, and spans the upper Lower, 713 \nMiddle and lower Upper Oxfordian stages (Fig. 7: Wright 1980; Rawson & Wright 714 \n1992, 2000). Disconformities are also present within the formations over parts of the 715 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 20\nbasin and lateral lithofacies changes have enabled Wright to recognize numerous 716 \nimpersistent members (Fig. 7). The group is equivalent to the mud-rich West Walton 717 \nFormation and the lower part of the Ampthill Clay of the East Midlands Shelf. 718 \n 719 \nAt the base of the group, the Lower Calcareous Grit (LCG) crops out along 720 \nthe upper part of the bold, west-facing escarpment of the Hambleton Hills and at 721 \nclassical localities such as Castle Hill (Scarborough) and Filey Brigg (Rawson & 722 \nWright 2000). The Lower Calcareous Grit ranges from 22 to 48 m thick in the 723 \nHambleton and Howardian Hills, and reaches 50 m on the Yorkshire coast. It 724 \nconsists predominantly of yellow, buff, fine- to medium-grained, calcareous 725 \nsandstone, with subsidiary beds and concretions of blue-grey, micritic limestone; 726 \nboth lithologies are variably ooidal and peloidal. Siliceous spicules of the sponge 727 \nRhaxella perforata form much of the clastic component (Sorby 1851; Wilson 1939; 728 \nHemingway 1974), and diagenesis of these has produced secondary thin beds of 729 \nchert, particularly in the lower part of the formation.  Thalassinoides burrows are very 730 \ncommon on bedding planes at some horizons; the backfilled burrows have a higher 731 \nspicule content and are more resistant to weathering, giving an irregular, nodular 732 \nappearance to weathered faces.  The micritic limestone concretions reach up to 1.5 733 \nm diameter, and are locally concentrated in the upper part of the formation (the \u2018Ball 734 \nBeds\u2019 of Arkell 1945).  735 \nThe contact between the LCG and the Oxford Clay is gradational, except on 736 \nthe Roulston Scar \u2018block\u2019 where the Oxford Clay is absent.  Near Sutton Bank, 737 \nbetween [SE 5156 8121] and [SE 5327 8206], the Oldstead Oolite Member (Wright 738 \n1980) is locally distinguished in the lower part of the LCG.  It consists of grey to 739 \nyellow-grey, bioclastic, ooidal wackestone-grainstone, up to 11 m thick, and cross-740 \nbedded in part.  The base is an erosive, unconformable junction with the underlying 741 \nRedcliff Rock Member in the Raven\u2019s Gill area [SE 5295 8186] (Fig. 33).  To the east, 742 \nin Shaw\u2019s Gill, the Oldstead Oolite overlies Oxford Clay with a sharp base. The 743 \nproportion of ooids (wackestone texture) decreases gradationally upwards through 744 \npassage to the spiculitic calcareous sandstone of the \u2018typical\u2019 Lower Calcareous Grit 745 \n(Powell et al. 1992; fig. 16), indicating increasing water depths through time. 746 \n 747 \nThe boundary between the LCG and the overlying Hambleton Oolite Member 748 \n(Coralline Oolite Formation) is gradational in the Hambleton Hills, the percentage of 749 \nooids increasing upwards at the expense of spiculitic sandstone. However, farther 750 \neast around Givendale, Dalby Forest [SE 854 863] and at the Bridestones [SE 878 751 \n907], a poorly consolidated yellow sand unit, cross-bedded in part, with calcareous 752 \nconcretions rich in bivalves and brachiopods and termed the Passage Beds Member 753 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 21\n(Wright 1972) or Yedmandale Member (BGS 2000), is present below the Hambleton 754 \nOolite, which has an erosive base. On the coast, at Filey Brigg, the Passage Beds 755 \nMember consists of bioturbated calcareous sandstone interbedded with grey 756 \nlimestone. The beds are rich in shell debris, including Nanogyra and Gervillella. 757 \nCross bedding indicates a south-east palaeoflow (Wright 1992). In addition to the 758 \nfauna noted above, the formation has yielded a benthic assemblage that includes 759 \nbivalves and brachiopods (Avicula, Pecten, Trigonia, Modiola, Ostrea and  760 \nRhynchonelloidea; Hemingway 1974), but these are rarely well preserved.  The 761 \ncarbonate concretions contain the richest fauna and have yielded many large, well 762 \npreserved ammonites that indicate the Bukowskii Subzone of the Cordatum Zone 763 \n(Fig. 7; Wright 1980).  764 \n 765 \nThe Coralline Oolite Formation (Wright 1972) comprises the following five 766 \nmembers, in upward sequence: Hambleton Oolite, Birdsall Calcareous Grit, Middle 767 \nCalcareous Grit, Malton Oolite and Coral Rag (Fig. 7).  The estimated thickness of 768 \nthe formation ranges from 60 to 70 m. The Coralline Oolite Formation consists of a 769 \nvaried sequence of grey, predominately ooidal and peloidal limestone (ooidal 770 \nwackestone to ooidal grainstone texture) intercalated with wedges of buff-yellow, 771 \nsparsely ooidal, calcareous fine-grained sandstone. Subsidiary lithologies include 772 \nmicritic limestone and reefal boundstone rich in corals and algae.  Over most of the 773 \nCleveland Basin, from Scarborough in the east to Northallerton in the west, the 774 \nstratigraphical relationship of the members assumes a \u2018layer-cake\u2019 sequence (Wright 775 \n1972; Hemingway 1974, fig. 53).  As the formation is traced from the north-west of 776 \nthe district to the south-east and beyond to the Howardian Hills, however, lateral 777 \nchanges in lithofacies are prevalent, particularly in the lower three members (Fig. 7).  778 \nSouth-east of Murton Common [SE 509 885], the Hambleton Oolite is separated into 779 \n\u2018upper\u2019 and \u2018lower\u2019 leaves by the intervening Birdsall Calcareous Grit (Wright 1972).  780 \nOn parts of Byland Moor, south of Cold Cam [SE 542 813], the ooidal limestones 781 \ncannot be traced and there is a continuous sequence of calcareous spiculitic 782 \nsandstone from the top of the Lower Calcareous Grit through the Birdsall Calcareous 783 \nGrit up to the base of the Middle Calcareous Grit (Fox-Strangways et al. 1886; Powell 784 \net al. 1992), the last being marked by a topographical feature. The top of the 785 \nformation is defined by the base of the Upper Calcareous Grit (Wright 1972) which 786 \nrests disconformably on the Coral Rag Member. 787 \n 788 \nThe Hambleton Oolite Member (up to 34 m thick) caps the escarpment of 789 \nthe Hambleton Hills and forms extensive dip slopes north of Pickering on the North 790 \nYorks Moors.  It consists of pale grey to white ooidal limestone (packstone to 791 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 22\ngrainstone texture), with a variable proportion of quartz sand, peloids and fragmented 792 \nshells; chert nodules are common in places.  Thin beds of calcareous sandstone with 793 \nscattered ooids are present in the southern part of the outcrop. Cross-bedding and 794 \nshallow scours are locally common in the ooidal limestone and the beds are 795 \nfrequently penetrated by circular, vertical burrows, up to 1 cm in diameter. Wright 796 \n(1972) showed that the oolite member splits into an upper and lower leaf in parts of 797 \nthe Hambleton Hills (Powell, et al. 1992) and in the Howardian Hills (S. Price pers. 798 \ncomm. 2008; Wright 2009). Penecontemporaneous slump structures and injection 799 \nphenomena (Fig 10b; Hemingway & Twombley 1963; Powell et al. 1992) are locally 800 \npresent at Shaw\u2019s Gate Quarry [SE 5233 8236] and Old Byland Grange Quarry [SE 801 \n5454 8567]. The fauna includes the ammonites Cardioceras, Goliathiceras, 802 \nAspidoceras and Perisphinctes, as well as sporadic bivalves including Exogyra, 803 \nLima, Astarte, Ostrea, Modiola and Pholadomya.  Echinoids are common in some 804 \nbeds and include Cidaris, Nucleolites and Hemicidaris (Hemingway 1974). Rare 805 \nspecimens of Rhaxella perforata and a brittle-star have been collected.  Ammonites 806 \nindicate an age ranging from the Cordatum Subzone to the Vertebrale Subzone, 807 \nspanning parts of the Cordatum and Densiplicatum zones (Fig. 7; Wright 1972). As 808 \nnoted above, the sharp erosive base of the Hambleton Oolite on the coast suggests 809 \na disconformity, and Wright (1972) has demonstrated that where the Passage Beds 810 \nMember is absent in the west of the outcrop, the Costicardia Subzone is missing. 811 \n 812 \nThe Birdsall Calcareous Grit Member (Cordatum Subzone) is a yellow-buff, 813 \ncalcareous, fine-grained spiculitic sandstone with scattered ooids and lenses of grey 814 \nchert, which was deposited coevally with the Hambleton Oolite.  It is up to 12 m thick 815 \nin the Hambleton Hills, but reaches 30 m in the Howardian Hills to the south, 816 \nsuggesting a provenance from that direction.  Nodular texture is common and is due 817 \nto abundant silica-rich Thalassinoides burrow-fill; Chondrites burrows are locally 818 \npresent in thin-bedded siltstone. The Birdsall Calcareous Grit has yielded the 819 \nsubzonal ammonite Cardioceras cordatum (Wright 1972, 2009) as well as bivalves, 820 \nincluding Chlamys fibrosa. 821 \n 822 \nThe Birdsall Calcareous Grit is well exposed between Cleave Dyke Quarry 823 \n[SE 507 863] and Boltby Scar [SE 506 857], but wedges out along the main 824 \nescarpment south of Boltby Scar, and also along the Caddell valley, so that the upper 825 \nand lower \u2018leaves\u2019 of the Hambleton Oolite are not distinguishable there (Powell et al. 826 \n1992, fig. 18).  827 \n 828 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 23\nThe Middle Calcareous Grit Member (Wright 1972) crops out in the south-829 \neast of the Hambleton Hills, on Byland Moor [SE 54 81], where it is about 12 m thick. 830 \nIt is similar in lithology to the Birdsall Calcareous Grit, and the rock is often 831 \ndecalcified at outcrop, so that only relict ooids can be seen.  The unit probably 832 \nbelongs to the upper part of the Vertebrale Subzone and the lower part of the 833 \nMaltonese Subzone (Figs 7, 36; Wright 1980). 834 \n 835 \nThe Malton Oolite Member (up to 20 m thick), formerly known as the 836 \nOsmington Oolite, separates the Middle Calcareous Grit from the stratigraphically 837 \nhigher Coral Rag Member (Figs 7, 36; Wright 1972), and comprises variably shelly, 838 \nooidal limestone. Quarries in the Malton area show large scale cross-bedding, 839 \nindicating deposition as laterally migrating ooidal shoals, similar to parts of the 840 \npresent-day Bahama Banks (Twombley 1964). Sparse ammonites indicate the 841 \nAntecedens Subzone (Wright 1972; Rawson & Wright, 1992).   842 \n 843 \nThe uppermost unit, the Coral Rag Member (up to 9m thick), belongs to the 844 \nParandieri Subzone (Wright 1972), and comprises coral-algal patch reefs, coral-shell 845 \ninter-reef debris and micritic limestone; both fore-reef and off-reef bioclastic (ooidal-846 \ncoral-shell) debris with the echinoid Hemicidaris and the oyster Lopha are common. 847 \nIsolated patch reefs had a relief of up to 3.5 m high above the surrounding substrate 848 \n(Twombley 1964; Hemingway 1974). Similar patch reefs are found in the Ayton area 849 \n[TA 002 856] (Hemingway 1974), although Rawson & Wright (2000) regarded this 850 \nlocality as uppermost Malton Oolite.  There, colonial corals include Thamnasteria, 851 \nIsastraea, Rhabdophyllia and Thecosmilia, in life position and as abraded fragments. 852 \nIn the Hambleton Hills, the member was formerly seen in a small inlier exposed by 853 \nquarrying of the overlying Upper Calcareous Grit at Snape Hill Quarry [SE 508 787]. 854 \nFox-Strangways et al. (1886, p. 367) recorded up to 1.4 m of Coral Rag (\u2018crystalline 855 \nlimestone\u2019) with the colonial coral Thecosmilia annularis, the echinoid Hemicidaris 856 \nflorigemma and the oyster Lopha gregarea.  Farther east, Twombley (1964) 857 \nrecognized a similar micrite-biomicrite facies rich in corals, echinoids and bivalves, 858 \nwhich he interpreted as a back-reef facies that developed to the north of a reefal 859 \nboundstone facies typically found in the Howardian Hills. 860 \n 861 \nAs the name suggests, the Upper Calcareous Grit Formation marks a 862 \nreturn to spiculitic sand sedimentation. It is between 12 and 15 m thick and consists 863 \nof very fine- to fine-grained, calcareous, spiculitic sandstone and siltstone, with 864 \nabundant beds of clayey, micritic limestone in the middle of the unit. In the Asenby \u2013865 \nCoxwold Graben, the clayey carbonate lithofacies is at least 6 m thick and is 866 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 24\nequivalent to the North Grimston Cementstone facies of Wright (1972, 1980), who 867 \nassigned it to the Nunningtonense subzone. Farther east, in the Kirkdale to Pickering 868 \noutcrop, the formation was divided into three members by Wright (1972), spanning 869 \nthe Nunningtonense Subzone to early Serratum Zone. In upward sequence, these 870 \nare the Newbridge Member, Spaunton Sandstone and Snape Sandstone.  The 871 \nNewbridge Member consists of buff, thin-bedded siltstone, marl and fine-grained 872 \nsandstone. The Spaunton Sandstone is a buff, thin-bedded, bioturbated, calcareous 873 \nsandstone with abundant sponge spicules and siliceous nodules.  The fauna includes 874 \nbelemnites and sparse bivalves.  Ammonites collected from the Spaunton Sandstone 875 \nindicate the Glosense Zone (Wright 1983; Sykes & Callomon 1979; Cox in Powell et 876 \nal. 1992). The Snape Sandstone Member is about 8 m thick, and consists of buff, 877 \nflaggy, cross-laminated siltstone and fine-grained sandstone with abundant 878 \nammonite fragments and, locally, bioclastic limestone.  Ammonites collected from the 879 \nSnape Sandstone indicate the Serratum Zone of the Upper Oxfordian (Wright 1972, 880 \n1980; Cox in Powell et al. 1992).  The junction between the Upper Calcareous Grit 881 \nand the overlying Upper Jurassic clays (Ampthill Clay and Kimmeridge Clay 882 \nformations) is a burrowed, gradational boundary (Cox & Richardson 1982) 883 \n 884 \nIn the Cleveland Basin, the Kimmeridge Clay was formerly thought to overlie 885 \nthe Upper Calcareous Grit directly (Fox-Strangways et al. 1886), but more recent 886 \nstudies of outcrops and borehole cores from the western end of the Vale of Pickering 887 \n(Cope 1974; Richardson in Institute of Geological Sciences 1974; Pyrah 1977; Cox 888 \nand Richardson 1982; Wignall 1993) show that mudstone (c. 48 m thick) with 889 \nsubsidiary beds and nodules of siderite, equivalent to the Ampthill Clay of southern 890 \nEngland and spanning the Upper Oxfordian Serratum, Regulare and Rosenkrantzi 891 \nzones (Fig. 7), is present between the top of the Corallian Group and the base of the 892 \nKimmeridge Clay. The Ampthill Clay is probably present at depth in the Asenby-893 \nCoxwold Graben, and its correlative, the Woodward Formation, has been proved (22-894 \n90 m thick) in the southern North Sea (Cox et al. 1987; Lott & Knox 1994). 895 \nAn abrupt change in geophysical log signatures at the top of the Corallian 896 \nGroup in the Hunmanby Borehole (Fig. 34) suggests that the Ampthill Clay is faulted 897 \nout here (Whittaker et al. 1985), but an attenuated succession (25 m thick) is present 898 \nin the Brown Moor Borehole below the Cretaceous unconformity (Fig. 34). The 899 \nAmpthill Clay has yielded infaunal and epifaunal bivalves, gastropods and echinoid 900 \nspines, suggesting that it was deposited in an oxic shallow marine environment in 901 \nresponse to rising sea-level and increased subsidence of the Cleveland Basin, as 902 \nmud and silt sediments spread to the north of the basin in Serratum Zone time, about 903 \n157 Ma (Fig. 37).

The Kimmeridge Clay 910 \nsuccession comprises, shelly mudstone, often bioturbated, interbedded with 911 \nbituminous (oil-rich) mudstone; abundant small \u201cDiscinisca latissima\u201d and ammonite 912 \nfragments are preserved in some beds. The succession represented by the 913 \nCymodoce, Mutabilis, Eudoxus, Autissiodorensis, Elegans, Scitulus and 914 \nWheatleyensis zones comprises cycles of mudstone, bituminous mudstone, and 915 \ncoccolith-rich limestone (Fig. 38). Above the Eudoxus Zone the formation becomes, 916 \noverall, more calcareous and less fissile; hard beds with low gamma-ray and high 917 \nsonic signatures comprise coccolith-rich limestone laminae. Outcrops are sparse, but 918 \ndark grey fissile mudstone with yellow-brown weathering, organic-rich laminae crop 919 \nout in the east of the Asenby-Coxwold Graben, and in the Vale of Pickering where 920 \nthe Ampthill and Kimmeridge formations form low ground, largely covered by 921 \nsuperficial deposits; they have also been proved in a number of groundwater and 922 \nhydrocarbon exploration boreholes (Fox-Strangways et al. 1886; Falcon & Kent 923 \n1960; Cox 1982; Cox et al. 1987; Herbin et al. 1991, 1993, 1995). The Kimmeridge 924 \nClay is intermittently exposed in the Vale of Pickering below thin Devensian till near 925 \nLow Pasture House [SE 5540 7830], Riseborough Bridge [SE 7568 8428] and at 926 \nBrink Hill [SE 540 786] where it was worked for brick clay. Comparison of the 927 \nKimmeridge Clay sequences recorded in boreholes in the Vale of Pickering and the 928 \nsouthern North Sea (Cox et al. 1987; Herbin et al. 1991, 1993) suggests that the 929 \nbeds at Brink Hill are younger than the Eudoxus Zone.  Ammonites collected from the 930 \nuppermost Kimmeridge Clay in boreholes on the north side of the Vale of Pickering 931 \n(Herbin et al. 1991) suggest the Pallasioides Zone (Fig. 7). 932 \n 933 \nOn the coast, the Kimmeridge Clay is overlain unconformably by the Speeton 934 \nClay Formation (Lower Cretaceous) at Speeton Sands [TA 140 763], where c. 10 m 935 \nof dark grey, finely laminated mudstones contain ammonites that indicate the 936 \nHudlestoni to lower Pectinatus zones (Rawson & Wright 2000). The unconformity 937 \nrepresents a considerable time gap, spanning the late Kimmeridgian (Pectinatus 938 \nZone and higher) and the Portlandian, plus the early part of the Cretaceous, so that 939 \nthe Upper Ryazanian \u2018D\u2019 Beds of the Speeton Clay rest on the Kimmeridge Clay.   940 \n 941 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 26\nThe Kimmeridge Clay represents the main source of hydrocarbons in the 942 \nnorthern part of the North Sea, where it has been buried to greater depths and at 943 \nhigher pressure than onshore and hence is mature enough to allow migration of 944 \nlighter hydrocarbons to reservoir rocks such as the Brent sandstones (Herbin et al. 945 \n1993). Although the Kimmeridge Clay in the Cleveland Basin and Sole Pit Basin is 946 \nbituminous, it is not sufficiently mature to have been a major source of hydrocarbons 947 \nin these areas. 948 \n 949 \nThe Fordon No. 1 Borehole (Falcon & Kent 1960) proved 385 m of 950 \nKimmeridge Clay, but this figure has been questioned by Cox et al. (1987) who noted 951 \nthat the Ampthill Clay was included in the total thickness in this borehole; they 952 \nsuggest that the total thickness of the formation in the Vale of Pickering is about 305 953 \nm.  However, the unit is much thicker here than the attenuated and eroded 954 \nsuccession south of the Market Weighton High where, below the unconformable 955 \nCretaceous Carstone Formation, 7.5 m of Kimmeridge Clay belonging to the Baylei 956 \nand Cymodoce zones, overlie the Ampthill Clay (Gaunt et al. 1992). The formation 957 \nthickens southwards, reaching c.115 m in The Wash area (Gallois 1994).    958 \n 959 \nLateral lithofacies changes and attenuation of the Ampthill\/Kimmeridge Clay 960 \nsuccession southwards towards the Market Weighton High are illustrated by the 961 \nHunmanby [TA 131 759] and Brown Moor [SE 813 620] boreholes (Fig. 34) 962 \n(Whittaker et al. 1985). At Hunmanby, the logs suggest that the Kimmeridge Clay 963 \nlithofacies did not extend northwards until Cymodoce Zone times, whereas farther 964 \nsouth at Brown Moor, near Market Weighton, the Ampthill Clay lithofacies extends 965 \nfrom Tenuiserratum Zone times (Malton Oolite equivalent) to Serratum Zone times, 966 \nthe Kimmeridge Clay being highly attenuated or not present due to pre-Cretaceous 967 \nerosion over the high.  However, the sharp boundary (Fig. 34) between the Corallian 968 \nGroup and the overlying mudstone of Cymodoce Zone age (c.f. lower Kimmeridge 969 \nClay) may indicate a faulted boundary here, with the Ampthill Clay cut out. 970 \n 971 \nOffshore in the Southern North Sea Basin (Fig. 7), the post-Callovian 972 \nsuccession (200-300 m thick) is defined as the Humber Group (Lott & Knox 1994). 973 \nThe subtle lithostratigraphical characteristics that allow the sequence to be 974 \nsubdivided onshore are not so apparent in the offshore geophysical logs. Offshore 975 \nequivalents of the Corallian Group are represented by calcareous sandstone overlain 976 \nby ooidal limestone (Corallian Formation; 70-100 m thick), but this passes laterally 977 \nsouthwards to the mudstone dominated Seeley Formation (equivalent to the West 978 \nWalton Formation of the East Midlands Shelf). Overlying these is the Woodward 979 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 27\nFormation (c. 50 m thick), a mudstone unit of late Oxfordian age broadly equivalent 980 \nto the Ampthill Clay (Cox et al.1993), overlain by the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, 981 \nwhich is about 250 m thick in the Sole Pit Basin.   982 \n 983 \n 984 \n5. JURASSIC SEDIMENTATION IN THE CLEVELAND BASIN: INTERPLAY OF 985 \nTECTONICS, RELATIVE-SEA LEVEL AND CLIMATE 986 \n 987 \nThe Jurassic succession of the Cleveland Basin, with its broad record of terrestrial, 988 \nshallow marine and relatively deep-water sedimentation, provides an opportunity to 989 \nassess the relative importance of the role of global and relative sea-level change, 990 \ntectonics, climate and sediment flux over about 49 million years of Earth history 991 \n(Hettangian 199.6 Ma to Late Kimmeridgian 150.8 Ma) (Ogg et al. 2008). However, 992 \napplication of the concepts of classical sequence stratigraphy (Van Wagoner et al. 993 \n1988; Haq et al. 1988) is difficult because successions preserved in the Cleveland 994 \nBasin do not record the full range of tectonic and environmental settings. The Early 995 \nJurassic marine succession (Lias Group), for example, does not show the shoreline 996 \nor terrestrial lithofacies, and conversely the non-marine units of the Ravenscar Group 997 \ncannot be traced laterally to shoreline and deeper water facies. Consequently, for a 998 \nlarge part of the succession, only changes in relative sea-level such as upward 999 \nshoaling parasequences, cycles and breaks in sedimentation can be deduced (van 1000 \nWagoner et al. 1988; Knox et al. 1991; Coe 1995). Generally, it is not possible to 1001 \ntrace these events laterally to show coastal onlap or offlap, or subaerial 1002 \nunconformities in coeval settings. We can, however, interpret the fluctuation in 1003 \nrelative sea-level within the Cleveland Basin from the sedimentary record, and 1004 \nassess the importance of global sea-level fluctuations against the role of intra- and 1005 \nextra-basinal tectonics.  Comparison of the much studied coastal exposures with 1006 \nlesser known areas in the west of the basin throws more light on the 1007 \npalaeogeography and tectonics, especially in Mid-Jurassic times.   1008 \n 1009 \nIn this section, the relative importance of these intra- and extra-basinal factors 1010 \nwill be assessed against an outline of significant events, and their sedimentological 1011 \ncharacteristics illustrated by the Jurassic succession.   1012 \n 1013 \n5.1 Lias Group: tempestites, shoaling cycles, and anoxia 1014 \n 1015 \nA shallow epicontinental sea extended throughout northwest Europe in Late Triassic 1016 \ntimes, following deposition of the brackish to shallow marine Penarth Group 1017 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 28\n(Warrington in Powell et al. 1992; Ivimey-Cook & Powell 1991). The Lias Group was 1018 \ndeposited as two major, upward shoaling cycles: the Redcar Mudstone to Staithes 1019 \nSandstone cycle and the Cleveland Ironstone to Blea Wyke Sandstone cycle (Knox 1020 \net al. 1991). The first cycle has been subdivided into 3 second-order cycles by Van 1021 \nBuchem & Knox (1998), represented by the Planorbis-Liasicus, Liasicus-Jamesomi 1022 \nand Jamesoni-Ibex intervals, the base of each cycle marking a significant rise in sea-1023 \nlevel. Hesselbo & Jenkyns (1995, 1998) recognized smaller, third-order cycles of 1024 \nabout 300-500 Ka, which approximate to the estimated duration of many ammonite 1025 \nzones and subzones, and suggest a link between cyclicity, sea-level change and 1026 \nextinction or faunal turn over. Each of the third-order cycles was further subdivided 1027 \ninto a number of smaller scale cycles or parasequences that were deposited in 1028 \nresponse to tectonic control and sediment flux. These cycles can be recognized in 1029 \nthe gamma-ray and sonic geophysical logs of the Felixkirk Borehole (Fig. 9) (Ivimey-1030 \nCook & Powell 1991). 1031 \n 1032 \nThe Hettangian to early Pliensbachian Redcar Mudstone comprises 1033 \nstratigraphically expanded and reduced successions (van Buchem & McCave 1989; 1034 \nIvimey-Cook & Powell 1991). Background sedimentation was predominantly 1035 \nhemipelagic mud, but during periods of low sedimentation rates, condensed 1036 \nsequences rich in iron ooids, glauconite or winnowed shell fragments were 1037 \ndeposited, especially on highs such as the Market Weighton area. Early Hettangian 1038 \nfair-weather sedimentation (lower Calcareous Shales) is represented by hemipelagic 1039 \nmud, but periods of deposition within fairweather wave base are indicated by thin, 1040 \nwinnowed laminae comprising thin shelled bivalves (Fig. 11a). The absence of 1041 \nbioturbation at this level suggests that sedimentation rates were high and\/or that the 1042 \nsubstrate was not sufficiently oxygenated for colonization by epifauna and infauna.  1043 \nHowever, the gamma\u2013ray inflections of the Felixkirk Borehole log (Figs 9, 11a) 1044 \nindicate a significant change up-sequence. The upper part of the Calcareous Shales 1045 \nis characterized in this borehole (Fig. 9) and in coastal exposures at Redcar and 1046 \nRobin Hood\u2019s Bay by 0.10 m to 0.40 m thick and, exceptionally, 1 m thick, beds of 1047 \ncoarser grained calcareous siltstone and fine-grained sandstone beds with abundant 1048 \nbivalve fragments and disarticulated shells (mostly Gryphaea) in various orientations 1049 \n(Fig. 11b,c). The coarse-grained beds have sharp bases, often with erosional scours, 1050 \nbut the junction often appears gradational due to downward penetrating burrows 1051 \n(especially Chondrites) that give a superficial appearance of gradational upward 1052 \nshoaling (Sellwood 1970). Multiple cycles are also present (Fig. 11d,c) and the tops 1053 \nof these beds show a sharp return to background mud sedimentation, although 1054 \noccasional winnowed siltstones are present in the upper few centimetres. These 1055 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 29\nbeds are interpreted as the result of storm-generated waves and bottom currents that 1056 \nredeposited calcareous sand from the nearshore zone as bioclastic sand layers 1057 \n(tempestites) resulting from powerful storm-surge and ebb currents (Aigner & 1058 \nReineck 1982). The storm-generated beds were deposited rapidly and punctuate the 1059 \nquieter, slower background sedimentation represented by grey mud and silt, often 1060 \nrich in nektonic ammonite\/belemnite faunas (Buckman 1915; Bairstow 1969; Ivimey-1061 \nCook & Powell 1991; Knox et al. 1991; van Buchem & McCave 1989). Deposition 1062 \nwas in the form of laterally continuous bioclastic sheet sand, traceable over many 1063 \nkilometres, possibly resulting from major hurricanes driving sea water onto the 1064 \ncoastal zone (storm surge), followed by ebbing offshore bottom currents (with 1065 \nerosional bases) or sediment suspension clouds.  1066 \n 1067 \nSimilar \u2018tempestite\u2019 beds characterize the overlying Siliceous Shales, the 1068 \nbase of which corresponds to the mid Turneri Zone in the Felixkirk Borehole but is 1069 \nslightly higher at Robin Hood\u2019s Bay (Hesselbo & Jenkins 1995). As the name 1070 \nsuggests, the coarse-grained beds comprise fine-grained sand but few shells. 1071 \nSedimentary structures such as scoured basal contacts and low-angle cross-1072 \nlamination indicate high-energy bottom currents (Fig. 12). However, the primary 1073 \nsedimentary structures are often obscured by extensive bioturbation, including 1074 \nDiplocraterion, Rhizocorallium, Teichichnus and Chondrites burrows that \u2018piped\u2019 1075 \nsediment downward, below the scoured erosional base, again giving a superficial 1076 \nappearance of an upward shoaling succession (Fig. 12). There is no indication that 1077 \nthe individual coarse tempestite beds represent upward coarsening (shallowing) 1078 \nsequences (Sellwood 1970). The change from the shell-rich to sand-rich storm beds 1079 \nsuggests provenance of the coarse-grained fraction from different shoreface facies or 1080 \nwas perhaps a result of greater sand flux into the nearshore zone during the late 1081 \nSinemurian. Although early Lias Group sedimentation is characterized by alternating 1082 \nhard\/soft beds in both southern England and the Cleveland Basin, the Redcar 1083 \nMudstone differs markedly from the climate- or diagenetically controlled \u2018rhythmic 1084 \ncouplet\u2019 sedimentation (Blue Lias) of the Dorset and South Wales provinces (Hallam 1085 \n1964; House 1985; Weedon 1986; Weedon & Jenkyns 1990). Sedimentation in the 1086 \nCleveland Basin was influenced by tectonic uplift of the Pennine High hinterland (Fig. 1087 \n2), increased siliciclastic sediment flux and storm events that redistributed coarser 1088 \nmaterial (bioclasts and sand) offshore from the nearshore sublittoral zone.  The 1089 \npresence of iron-rich ooids and glauconite (Fig. 11c) in some of the sandy layers 1090 \nsuggests shoaling conditions during condensed phases, possibly a result of a relative 1091 \nsea-level fall (Knox et al. 1991; Hesselbo & Jenkyns 1995). The change in storm 1092 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 30\nsedimentation sequences from the lower part of the Calcareous Shales to the 1093 \nSiliceous Shales as seen in the Felixkirk cores is summarized in Fig. 12. 1094 \n 1095 \n5.1.1 Early Pliensbachian sea-level rise and climatically induced sedimentation 1096 \n 1097 \nThe Sinemurian-Pliensbachian boundary (base Jamesoni Zone) marks a major sea 1098 \nlevel rise (Sellwood 1972; Knox et al. 1991; Hesselbo & Jenkyns 1995; van Buchem 1099 \n& Knox 1998) and is reflected clearly in the \u2018smooth\u2019 gamma and sonic log interval 1100 \nabove 164.38 m depth in the Felixkirk borehole (Fig. 9). The same deepening event 1101 \nis clearly visible in the GSSP section at Wine Haven, Robin Hood\u2019s Bay (Knox et al. 1102 \n1991; Meister et al. 2003). The global sea-level rise is manifested in deposition of 1103 \ndark grey to black hemipelagic mud, deposited in quiet bottom conditions that 1104 \nresulted in local anoxia on the sea-floor, below storm wave base. Coarse-grained 1105 \nstorm layers are absent, but the sediment interface was not wholly anoxic or 1106 \ninimitable to life as semi-infaunal bivalves such as Pinna sp. are found partially 1107 \nburied, in situ, together with pyritized burrows and concretions and a nektonic fauna 1108 \nof pyritized belemnites (locally current aligned) and ammonites.  The last include the 1109 \nzonal fossil Echioceras raricostatum in the lower part. Partial burial of large Pinna 1110 \nshells in life position indicates rapid sedimentation rates in a distal offshore setting.  1111 \n 1112 \nThe section in Robin Hood\u2019s Bay and the Felixkirk Borehole logs show a 1113 \ngradual increase in the sand:mud ratio above the Taylori Subzone, in the form of 1114 \ndiscrete pale\/dark banding, and the lower part of the Ironstone Shales is locally 1115 \nknown as the \u2018Banded Shales\u2019 (van Buchem & McCave 1989). Sand is present as 1116 \nthin (2-3cm) graded and delicately laminated beds, but unlike the Siliceous Shales, 1117 \nthere is no evidence for erosive traction currents. The Banded Shales represent 1118 \ndistal hemipelagic sedimentation with silt and fine-grained sand being introduced into 1119 \nthe deeper parts of the basin. Isolated lenses of sand preserved as large \u2018gutter 1120 \ncasts\u2019 with low angle cross-lamination suggest periodic fluxes of sand that were 1121 \ndispersed offshore from the littoral zone. Again in contrast to the Siliceous Shales, 1122 \nthese sand lenses are not bioturbated, suggesting rapid sedimentation rates and little 1123 \ntime for colonization by benthic and infaunal organisms. Lighter bands probably 1124 \nrepresent the fallout of plankton and silt-grade sediment during more intense 1125 \nweathering of the hinterland. Regular banding in these beds has been attributed to 1126 \nalternating climatic cycles (van Buchem et al. 1992, 1994); analysis of the cycles 1127 \nsuggest a regular periodicity, possibly linked to orbitally induced Milankovitch climatic 1128 \ncycles of perhaps 26 Ka periodicity (precession cycles). In contrast to the cycles 1129 \ninduced by storm events in the lower part of the succession (Calcareous Shales and 1130 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 31\nSiliceous Shales), the Banded Shales cycles are therefore probably the result of 1131 \nastronomically induced climatic variations.   1132 \n 1133 \nA glauconitic-ooidal bed at the base of the Ibex Zone (Figs 9, 14) in Robin 1134 \nHood\u2019s Bay marks a depositional hiatus at the top of the Banded Shales, and the 1135 \noverlying Ironstone Shales show a strong upward-coarsening gamma-ray signature 1136 \nas pulses of sand were deposited offshore as distal pro-delta deposits, a precursor to 1137 \nprogradation of the littoral sands of the overlying Staithes Formation (near base of 1138 \nthe Davoei Zone; Fig. 9). 1139 \n 1140 \n5.1.2 Sandy tempestites and upward shoaling cycles  1141 \n 1142 \nThe base of the Staithes Sandstone at 94.85 m in the Felixkirk Borehole and Bed 1 1143 \nat Staithes (Howarth 1955; Powell 1984; Howard 1985) marks an influx of shallow 1144 \nmarine sand that extended over much of England during late Pliensbachian times 1145 \n(Davoei Zone). Individual beds have shallow, scoured erosive bases and parallel and 1146 \nlow-angle cross-lamination, and were deposited as extensive sublittoral and 1147 \nshoreface sands. Sand influx was probably due to shallowing of all the English sub-1148 \nbasins (e.g. Wessex Basin, East Midlands Shelf, Cleveland Basin) as a result of 1149 \ntectonic uplift of the source areas. The effects of this relative sea-level fall are more 1150 \npronounced over the Market Weighton High and the East Midlands Shelf where the 1151 \nStaithes Sandstone equivalents (and the lower part of the Cleveland Ironstone) were 1152 \nremoved by erosion prior to deposition of the Marlstone Rock Formation (broadly 1153 \nequivalent to the Cleveland Ironstone) in Spinatum Zone times (Fig. 16; Howard 1154 \n1985).  1155 \n 1156 \nSand-rich tempestites typified by the Staithes Sandstone beds are sheet-like 1157 \nin general form, with planar, low-angle and hummocky cross stratification; some beds 1158 \nhave wave-rippled tops (Figs. 10 c, f,). Erosional gutter casts at the base of 1159 \ntempestite beds (Fig. 10d) indicate an east to west palaeoslope, and internal low-1160 \nangle cross-lamination measurements suggest that dominant storm-surge currents 1161 \nflowed predominantly to the east. Sheet sands were deposited by storm-surge-ebb 1162 \ncurrents that re-distributed sand from the nearshore zone to offshore locations 1163 \n(Howard 1985). Consequently, beds often have sharp erosive bases, occasionally 1164 \nwith shelly lags (Fig. 10e). Low angle cross-lamination and hummocky cross-1165 \nstratification represent reworking by waning, wave-generated, oscillatory currents 1166 \n(Nottvedt & Kriesa 1987). These sedimentary structures are locally destroyed by 1167 \nintense bioturbation where the residence time of the sand was longer and the 1168 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 32\nsubstrate colonized by infaunal organisms (Plate xx). However, where sedimentation 1169 \nrates were high, the internal structures are well preserved. The location offshore 1170 \nbelow fair-weather wave base also aided preservation of the internal structures (Plate 1171 \nxx).  Ichnofossil (trace fossil) assemblages provide a further insight into 1172 \npalaeoenvironmental conditions during \u2018Staithes time\u2019 (Seilacher 1967; Howard 1985; 1173 \nKnox et al. 1991). Assemblages from shoreface environments are dominated by 1174 \ndeposit feeders such as Chondrites and Planolites, which exploited nutrient-rich 1175 \nlaminae as opposed to clean sand (Fig. 10f); assemblages from innermost shelf 1176 \nenvironments, below fair weather wave-base, are characterized by dwelling burrows 1177 \nof infaunal deposits feeders such as Skolithos, Diplocraterion and those with 1178 \nspecialist sediment-mining behaviours such as Rhizocorallium, Asterosoma and 1179 \nThalassinoides. Distinctive sediment-mining burrows, such as Siphonites and 1180 \nTeichichnus, are present in the mid-shelf zone; the outer shelf assemblage is again 1181 \ntypified by traces of sediment mining activities of deposit feeding organisms.   1182 \n 1183 \nUpward coarsening (shoaling) cycles in the Staithes Formation are well 1184 \ndisplayed between Bed 17 (Howarth 1955) and Bed 23 near Penny Nab, Staithes 1185 \n(Howard 1985). These trends are also apparent in the attenuated sequence in the 1186 \nFelixkirk cores (Fig. 9, above 82 m depth; Fig. 10d) and are interpreted as 1187 \nprogradation of shoreface and inner-shelf sands during rising sea-level as 1188 \naccommodation space increased on the shelf, a pattern seen also in the overlying 1189 \nCleveland Ironstone cycles. 1190 \n 1191 \n5.1.3 Transgressive cycles and iron-rich lagoons   1192 \n 1193 \nThe Cleveland Ironstone Formation comprises a succession of ooidal ironstone 1194 \n(formerly mined seams) separated by mudstone and fine-grained sandstones. These 1195 \nfine-grained sediments were deposited in laterally extensive lagoons and shallow 1196 \nlittoral seas during a period of much reduced input of terrigenous, siliciclastic 1197 \nsediment, probably as a result of rising sea-level (second-order rise) during the 1198 \nMargaritatus Zone, which blanketed the geomorphologically low-lying hinterland. The 1199 \nlate Pliensbachian appears to have been a time of reduced tectonic uplift of the 1200 \nsurrounding landmass, including the Pennine High and the Mid-North Sea High, 1201 \nwhich were the main sources of clastic sediment from Hettangian to early 1202 \nPliensbachian time. However, Chowns (1966) showed that the ironstone-rich 1203 \nsuccession was deposited over a long time period (i.e. it is a condensed sequence) 1204 \nand included a major phase of folding and erosion that produced an intraformational 1205 \nunconformity below the Pecten Seam (base Spinatum Zone) (Chowns 1966; 1206 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 33\nHemingway 1974; Howard 1985).  The ironstone seams and the intervening 1207 \nsiliciclastic sediments thin towards the south (Market Weighton High) and the west 1208 \n(towards the basin margin) (Figs 15, 16, 18). In addition, the five seams below the 1209 \nbase Spinatum Zone unconformity are cut out successively southwards as result of 1210 \nuplift that removed up to 25 m of beds (Figs. 18,19). Flexuring of the shallow marine 1211 \nbasin may also have contributed to extensive shallow water conditions over the shelf 1212 \nduring this period, and may have been related to gentle isostatic uplift of the Market 1213 \nWeighton High where the \u2018sub-Spinatum unconformity\u2019 is most pronounced (Howard 1214 \n1985) (Fig. 16). In the west of the basin, only the Osmotherly and Avicula seams are 1215 \npresent below the Main Seam unconformity, represented by thin, condensed units 1216 \nexhibiting burrowing and boring, consistent with a long period of accumulation with 1217 \nlittle siliciclastic sediment input (Fig. 19). 1218 \n 1219 \nThe coastal succession at Penny Nab (Howarth 1955; Howard 1985; Knox et 1220 \nal 1991) is generally characterized by upward coarsening (shoaling) siliciclastic 1221 \ncycles, namely mudstone, siltstone and fine-grained sandstone (with tempestite 1222 \nlaminae) capped by transgressive, berthierine-rich ooidal ironstone.  The latter have 1223 \nsharp erosional bases, commonly with reworked bored siderite and phosphatized 1224 \nnodules and occasional shelly lags, overlain by intensely bioturbated ooidal 1225 \nironstone. Berthierine (formerly chamosite) ooids are set in a matrix of 1226 \nmicrocrystalline siderite; ooids commonly exhibit crushing and unravelling of 1227 \nconcentric layers (spastolithization) (Marley 1857; Hallimond 1925; Chowns 1966; 1228 \nHemingway 1978, fig. 45). Iron, in colloidal form, was probably derived from 1229 \ndissolution of lateritic soils as a result of marine flooding of the low-lying hinterland 1230 \nduring punctuated periods of sea-level rise. The Cleveland Basin lay at about 30 1231 \ndegrees north during late Pliensbachian times, within the equatorial zone, and a hot 1232 \nclimatic regime conducive to lateritic weathering is likely (cf. warm seasonal climate 1233 \nduring the early Mid Jurassic; Morgans et al. 1999). Iron colloids may have been 1234 \nintroduced into the shallow marine lagoons by rivers draining from the hinterland 1235 \nareas or through marine flooding of deeply laterized coastal areas; preservation of 1236 \ncolloidal iron would have required reducing anoxic conditions, possibly a result of 1237 \nhigh levels of organic matter in the bottom sediment (Curtis & Spears 1968). 1238 \n 1239 \nThe lower part of the succession (Penny Nab Member, 19 m) on the coast, 1240 \nincludes four upward coarsening (shoaling) parasequences, generally capped by 1241 \ntransgressive ironstones (Osmotherly, Avicula, Raisdale and Two Foot seams) and 1242 \nan incomplete cycle between the Two Foot Seam and the unconformable base of the 1243 \nPecten Seam (base Spinatum Zone) (Fig. 15). A typical cycle pattern is illustrated by 1244 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 34\nthe Avicula to Raisdale interval (Howarth 1955; Chowns 1966; Howard 1985; Knox et 1245 \nal., 1991). The Avicula Seam (Fig. 17a,b) was deposited during a marine 1246 \ntransgression and comprises berthierine\u2013rich, ooidal ironstone with a basal lag 1247 \ndeposit that includes worn bivalve fragments and reworked and bored siderite 1248 \nmudstone nodules with pyritized rims. The overlying upward coarsening (shoaling) 1249 \nphase comprises laminated mudstone with thin, graded, low-energy tempestites 1250 \n(\u2018striped beds\u2019) locally, and with east-west orientated gutter-casts (Greensmith et al. 1251 \n1980) produced by strong, storm-generated, erosive, helicoidal bottom currents that 1252 \nflowed down a gentle eastward dipping palaeoslope. Similar gutter-casts are seen in 1253 \nthe \u2018striped siltstones\u2019 immediately below the Raisdale Seam (Fig.17c), which, in turn, 1254 \nmarks the next punctuated sea-level rise and marine transgression.  Microfacies 1255 \nanalysis of the Cleveland Ironstone (Macquaker & Taylor 1996) confirmed systematic 1256 \nupward-coarsening and upward-fining unit at various scales; the small-scale upward-1257 \ncoarsening trends (0.1 \u2013 1.0 m thick) are attributed to shoaling parasequences whist 1258 \nthe large \u2013scale (1.0 - 3.0 m thick) upward-fining and upward-coarsening packages 1259 \nare interpreted as retrogradational and progradational units, respectively. Ironstone 1260 \nbeds are interpreted as marking the interval (sequence boundary) between 1261 \nprogradational and retrogradational units; phosphate-rich horizons probably 1262 \nrepresent maximum flooding surfaces across the shallow lagoons.  1263 \n 1264 \nUp sequence, the Kettleness Member (10 m thick), which includes the Main 1265 \nSeam, oversteps successively younger Lias Group units to the south towards Market 1266 \nWeighton, and to the west (Fig. 16). Just north of the Market Weighton High, at 1267 \nWhitwell-on-the-Hill, it rests unconformably on beds as low as the Redcar Mudstone, 1268 \nbut can be traced southwards over this structure to the East Midlands Shelf where it 1269 \nis equivalent to a highly condensed iron-rich sandstone unit, the Marlstone Rock 1270 \nFormation. In turn, the Marlstone Rock Formation can be traced southwards to the 1271 \nWessex Basin where it is represented by the Dyrham Siltstone (Cox et al. 1999). In 1272 \nthe Cleveland Basin, the condensed succession mostly comprises the Pecten and 1273 \nMain seams with thin siltstones, but south of Osmotherly even the Pecten Seam is 1274 \ncut out below the unconformity (Frost 1998), so that the Main Seam rests 1275 \nunconformably on siliciclastic beds above the Avicula Seam (Figs 16, 18,19). Overall, 1276 \nthe Kettleness Member\/Marlstone Rock succession marks a basin-wide shallowing 1277 \nphase. The base \u2018base Spinatum unconformity\u2019, south and westerly thinning, and 1278 \ncondensed ooidal ironstone seams suggest that shallowing is attributable to regional 1279 \ntectonic uplift rather than global sea-level fall. Condensed sequences of ironstone 1280 \nand siliciclastic sediments indicate that the hinterland areas were not uplifted nor 1281 \nsupplying large volumes of sediment to the basin. If, as noted above, the iron was 1282 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 35\nderived from the weathering of thick lateritic soils, it is likely that the marginal areas 1283 \nwere geomorphologically low lying, so that minor sea-level rises that characterize the 1284 \ntransgressive ironstone parasequences (small-cycles) extended over a wide 1285 \ngeographical area. The presence of intensely bioturbated horizons, ooidal ironstone, 1286 \nsub-rounded phosphatic pebbles, locally bored surfaces and a prolific benthic fauna 1287 \nconfirm shallow-water conditions. Minor isostatic tectonic fluctuations (e.g. uplift of 1288 \nthe Market Weighton High) would therefore have had a profound effect over a wide 1289 \narea.         1290 \n 1291 \n5.1.4 Subsidence, anoxia and a second major shoaling cycle 1292 \n 1293 \nThe Toarcian \u2018Upper Lias\u2019 succession marks a second major shallowing cycle (cf. 1294 \nRedcar Mudstone to top Staithes Sandstone cycle) comprising the Whitby Mudstone 1295 \nto Blea Wyke Sandstone formations (Dean 1954; Hallam 1967a; Powell 1984; Knox 1296 \n1984). Following a relatively quiescent tectonic phase during the late Pliensbachian, 1297 \nthe early Toarcian (Tenuicostatum Zone) was a period of major basin subsidence 1298 \nthroughout England. More rapid subsidence of the Cleveland Basin, resulting in 1299 \nrelatively deeper open water conditions during deposition of the Grey Shales Member 1300 \n(Tenuicostatum Subzone), was accompanied by increased sediment flux. Fluctuating 1301 \noxic and slightly anoxic bottom conditions are present through the Grey Shales but 1302 \nincreasingly higher levels of organic carbon are present from the Semicelatum 1303 \nSubzone (Figs 9, 20) through the Exaratum Subzone (Falciferum Zone), spanning 1304 \nthe uppermost Grey Shales and the \u2018Jet Rock\u2019 (Mulgrave Shale Member). The high 1305 \norganic carbon content has been long recognized as indicating ocean-wide anoxia at 1306 \nthe sediment-water interface (Hallam 1967a, 1967b; Morris 1979; Jenkyns 1988; 1307 \nJenkyns & Clayton 1997). Minor shoaling cycles with striped siltstone laminae (Figs 1308 \n17d, 20) suggest that water depths were in the region of tens of metres, similar to 1309 \ndepths for the Siliceous Shales. However, anoxia on the ocean floor may have been 1310 \ndue to a density-stratified ocean (O\u2019Brien 1990) with little overturn of the water 1311 \ncolumn, resulting in stagnant bottom conditions. Prolific ammonite faunas testify to 1312 \noxygenated water above, conducive to nektonic faunas. The cause of the Toarcian 1313 \nOceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) anoxia during Exaratum Subzone time in NW Europe 1314 \nhas been the subject of much debate. Hesselbo et al. (2000) demonstrated that 1315 \nisotopically light carbon isotopes were present ocean-wide and they attributed this to 1316 \na discharge of methane from the overturn of gas hydrate (a solid ice-like substance 1317 \nrich in biogenic methane found today on deep continental marine margins, e.g. 1318 \nAntarctica).  Further studies using osmium, carbon and strontium isotopes (Jenkyns 1319 \net al. 2002; Cohen et al. 2004; Kemp et al. 2005) have demonstrated a sharp 1320 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 36\nnegative excursion in isotope ratios, such as the short-lived carbon (\u03b413Corg) isotope 1321 \nexcursion within the Exaratum Subzone that is broadly coincident with a high osmium 1322 \n(187Os\/188Os) isotope ratio excursion (Fig. 20).  The marked change in organic carbon 1323 \nisotope ratios occurs in three marked steps at the base of the Falciferum Zone 1324 \n(Exaratum Subzone) and these steps are inferred to coincide with a marked 1325 \nreduction of benthic species in \u2018shifts\u2019 of minus 67% and minus 50%. High \u03b413Corg 1326 \nvalues result from an increase in the burial of biogenic carbon whereas low \u03b413Corg 1327 \nvalues result from oxidation of carbon in the sediment or introduction of reduced 1328 \ncarbon. Kemp et al. (2005) attribute the anoxic phase to the release of carbon 1329 \ndioxide into the atmosphere as a result of overturn of methane hydrates normally 1330 \ntrapped as a solid phase on the ocean floor. Both methane and, its oxidation product 1331 \ncarbon dioxide, are significant \u2018greenhouse gases\u2019 and their release into the 1332 \natmosphere may have caused global warming, in turn causing higher ocean 1333 \ntemperatures, sea-floor anoxia and extinction of benthic, planktonic, and nektonic 1334 \nspecies worldwide. The high osmium isotope ratio over this interval was interpreted 1335 \nby Kemp et al. (2005) to have resulted from warm-climate, lateritic weathering of the 1336 \nhinterland (c.f. the origin of iron colloids in the Cleveland Ironstones). A subsequent 1337 \nfall in the osmium isotope ratio was interpreted to be due to subsequent take up of 1338 \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere through the incorporation of the gas in the 1339 \nformation (weathering) of lateritic soils. However,  alternative explanations have been 1340 \nproposed, first that  the rapid negative \u03b413Corg value excursions are attributable to 1341 \nrecycling of isotopically light carbon from the lower water column in a local euxinic 1342 \n(oxygen-starved) epeiric sea (McArthur et al., 2000; Wignall et al. 2006), and 1343 \nsecondly, based on fossil leaf stomatal frequency, the fluctuations in carbon dioxide 1344 \nand the injection of  isotopiocally light carbon into the atmosphere is a result of the 1345 \nrelease of thermogenic methane into the atmosphere generated through the intrusion 1346 \nof Gondwana coals by dolerites in the Karoo-Ferrar region (McElwain et al. 2005)  1347 \n 1348 \nRenewed influx of fine-grained terrigenous siliciclastics kept pace with 1349 \ngradual subsidence of the basin during deposition of the overlying Alum Shales 1350 \nMember under more oxygenated conditions (Pye & Krinsley 1986). Periods of lower 1351 \nsedimentation rate are indicated by bands of phosphatic nodules in the upper part of 1352 \nthe unit. A paucity of benthic fauna compared to typical Lias mudstones may have 1353 \nbeen due to climatic conditions. A shallowing, upward-coarsening trend and a 1354 \nconcomitant increase in burrowing benthic fauna (including brachiopods and 1355 \nbivalves) (Knox 1984) is seen in the uppermost Toarcian sediments, only locally 1356 \npreserved (e.g. Peak Trough) below the Dogger unconformity. Within the Peak 1357 \nTrough and its onshore extension at Blea Wyke (Fig. 23), the shoaling trend (Figs 21, 1358 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 37\n22) is indicated by the Peak Mudstone and Fox Cliff Siltstone and the uppermost unit 1359 \nof the Lias Group, the Blea Wyke Sandstone. The latter comprises fine-grained 1360 \nsandstone, and like much of the late Pliensbachian Staithes Sandstone, is heavily 1361 \nbioturbated, the reworking destroying most of the primary sedimentary structures. 1362 \nHowever, low-angle cross bedding (southwards palaeocurrent) is present, as well as 1363 \nscoured erosive surfaces with bivalve fragments (Trigonia; Nerinea), indicating 1364 \ndeposition in the littoral zone. As in Staithes Sandstone times, the shallowing trend is 1365 \nattributed to regional tectonic uplift, probably doming of the Mid-North Sea High 1366 \n(Sellwood & Hallam 1974; Underhill & Partington 1993) and the Pennine highlands, 1367 \nrather than global sea-level fall. 1368 \n 1369 \n 1370 \n5.2 Early-Mid Jurassic intra-basinal tectonics and heterolithic condensed 1371 \nmarine sedimentation 1372 \n 1373 \nRegional tectonics (doming and related uplift) that resulted in shoaling marine 1374 \nenvironments during deposition of the late Toarcian Lias Group succession continued 1375 \nduring early Aalenian times. The Cleveland Basin was gently folded during a 1376 \ncompressional event in late Moorei Subzone to early Opalinum Subzone times (Black 1377 \n1934a; Hemingway 1974), which resulted in erosion of unconsolidated and semi-1378 \nconsolidated mud and sand. Up to 60 m of mud, silt and sand (uppermost Lias 1379 \nGroup) was eroded in the central coastal areas (e.g. Whitby) and in the Hambleton 1380 \nHills, where variable thicknesses of the Alum Shales are preserved below the Dogger 1381 \nFormation or, where that formation is absent, below the erosive base of the Saltwick 1382 \nFormation (Powell et al. 1992; Frost 1998). Southwards, towards the Market 1383 \nWeighton High, the Lias formations become thinner and the group is eroded down to 1384 \nlower stratigraphical levels (Redcar Mudstone Formation). 1385 \n 1386 \nThe Dogger Formation is a heterolithic unit deposited as a condensed 1387 \nsuccession over a considerable period of time (Opalinum Zone to Murchisonae Zone) 1388 \nand probably over the whole basin, although in some areas, e.g. Botton Head and 1389 \nalong parts of the western escarpment, it was removed by erosion prior to deposition 1390 \nof the fluvio-deltaic Saltwick Formation. Despite intense bioturbation and reworking of 1391 \nthis predominantly ferruginous, berthierine-rich sandstone unit, two subdivisions have 1392 \nbeen defined within the formation, namely a lower Opalinum Zone succession in the 1393 \neast of the basin, and a Murchisonae Zone succession that oversteps it, in the west 1394 \n(Macmillan 1932; Black 1934a; Rastall & Hemingway 1939, 1940, 1941, 1943, 1949; 1395 \nHemingway 1974). However, some of the Dogger sands represent homogenized 1396 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 38\nOpalinum Zone sediments reworked as a palimpsest unit in late Murchisonae time. 1397 \nThe relationship between the Dogger Formation and the underlying and overlying 1398 \nbeds is critical in unravelling its depositional history.  Near Whitby (East Cliff), where 1399 \nthe Dogger unconformably overlies the Alum Shales (Fig. 17e), the presence of 1400 \ndownward penetrating soft-sediment burrows (Thalassinoides), backfilled with 1401 \nDogger sand and phosphatic pebbles that were \u2018piped\u2019 up to 25 cm into the 1402 \nunderlying Alum Shale muds, indicates that the latter were still relatively 1403 \nunconsolidated in this area during deposition of the Dogger. This suggests that the 1404 \npost-Toarcian compressional folding and subsequent erosion of semi- or un-1405 \nconsolidated sediment took place over a short time interval, or perhaps that the 1406 \ncompressional folding was ongoing from late Toarcian times as a result of Mid North 1407 \nSea volcanic doming. The Peak Trough (Milsom & Rawson 1989), a narrow syn-1408 \ndepositional graben that preserves the uppermost Lias at Blea Wyke Point (Fig. 23), 1409 \nmay have resulted from transtension rather than compression during this tectonic 1410 \nevent. Furthermore, the top of the Dogger sandstone at Blea Wyke and Whitby East 1411 \nCliff is penetrated by carbonaceous-lined plant rootlets from the overlying paralic 1412 \nSaltwick Formation, demonstrating that the Dogger sands were also poorly 1413 \nconsolidated when the Saltwick fluvio-delatic sediments were deposited.  1414 \nIn the west of the basin, where the Dogger is thought to be mostly of early 1415 \nMurchisonae Subzone age (Hemingway, 1974), the formation varies laterally over a 1416 \nfew tens of metres from ferruginous berthierene-rich ooidal ironstone to ferruginous 1417 \nsandstone and cross-bedded ooidal limestone at Cleave Quarry [SE 497 828] 1418 \n(Powell et al. 1992; Fig. 29). Ooidal limestone is also present in the Mowthorpe area 1419 \n[SE 67 68], where there is a thick development of bi-modal, trough cross-bedded 1420 \nbioclastic limestone that includes the bryozoan Collapora [formerly Haploecia] 1421 \nstraminaea, which is more usually associated with the Bajocian Lebberston Member 1422 \n(J Ford pers comm. 2007). These atypical carbonates, preferentially preserved in 1423 \nsmall shallow sub-basins, indicate the presence, locally, of a Dogger carbonate 1424 \nplatform in Murchisonae times. Carbonate shoal deposits are preferentially preserved 1425 \nand may once have been more widespread ooidal banks that formed on shoaling 1426 \nhighs and were subsequently swept offshore to accumulate in local downwarps. In 1427 \nthe Howardian Hills, well-rounded calcareous mudstone pebbles and phosphatic 1428 \npebbles (Spy Hill lithofacies) are found together with fossil wood \u2018raffle\u2019 in some of 1429 \nthe more typical ferruginous sandstones, which here include quartz granules that 1430 \nwere probably derived from the Carboniferous Millstone Grit, suggesting a westerly 1431 \nprovenance from the Pennine highlands. In the west of the basin, there is no 1432 \nevidence, such as downward penetrating burrows, that the underlying Alum Shale 1433 \nmuds were unconsolidated during deposition of the Dogger, probably due to longer 1434 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 39\nresidence time and early diagenesis of the folded Lias Group sediments in the west.  1435 \nLithification of these pre-Dogger sediments is further indicated by the presence, in 1436 \nthe Cold Moor area [NZ 558 002], of rounded, bored concretions containing Toarcian 1437 \nammonites (including Dactylioceras, Hildoceras and Harpoceras) and other derived 1438 \nToarcian ammonite clasts (Black 1934a), which show that the Whitby Mudstone 1439 \nsediments (down to the stratigraphical level of the Grey Shales Member) had, in 1440 \ncontrast to the soft sediment burrows at Whitby, gone through early diagenesis and 1441 \nwere lithified prior to the pre-Dogger tectonic folding, uplift and erosion.  1442 \n 1443 \nLocally, in the Rosedale area [SE 729 946], the Whitby Mudstone was deeply 1444 \neroded into a series of shallow \u2018boat-shaped\u2019 depressions, about 500 m long by 30 m 1445 \nwide (Marley 1870). The depressions were filled with a distinctive Dogger lithofacies, 1446 \na \u2018magnetite\u2019 ironstone (now shown to be a form of ferric, chronstedtite spinel; 1447 \nHemingway 1974) overlain by ferruginous sandstone (Fox-Strangways et al. 1885; 1448 \nRastall & Hemingway 1949). The iron ore probably represents a condensed, remani\u00e9 1449 \ndeposit of early Opalinum Zone times that was preserved locally in shallow 1450 \ndepressions on the pre-Dogger sea-floor.  1451 \nThe regional depositional setting of the enigmatic highly variable Dogger unit 1452 \nis outlined below: 1453 \n 1454 \n(a) Compressional and transpressional folding of poorly consolidated muds, at least 1455 \nin the upper part of the sediment profile; transpression and local rifting resulted in the 1456 \npreservation of latest Toarcian Blea Wyke sands locally in the Peak Trough, but 1457 \nelsewhere up to 60 m of relatively unconsolidated sediment was removed in late 1458 \nToarcian to earliest Aalenian times. 1459 \n 1460 \n(b) In the west of the basin, uplift resulted in the development of local submarine 1461 \nhighs within fairweather wave-base; here, during Murchisonae times, warm water 1462 \nooidal shoals developed with an abundant shelly fauna that included bivalves, 1463 \ngastropods, solitary corals and bryozoa. These carbonate platform deposits were 1464 \nprobably more extensive than the present outcrop; mobile carbonate sediments were 1465 \npreserved in local sub-basins on the lithified undulating pre-Dogger sea floor. Erosion 1466 \nto lower stratigraphical levels, including erosion of the the Grey Shale Member, 1467 \nreworked already lithified carbonate concretions and phosphatic nodules, which often 1468 \ncontain Toarcian ammonites, as a basal conglomeratic lag deposit in the Cold Moor 1469 \narea [NZ 558 002]. 1470 \n 1471 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 40\n(c) Uplift of the hinterland, balanced by basin subsidence, resulted in the southward 1472 \nand esatward progradation of the Middle Jurassic rivers and delta fronts. During the 1473 \nlate Opalinum to Murchisonae zones, siliciclastic sediments were deposited in a pro-1474 \ndelta, shallow marine environment characterized by reworking of earlier carbonate 1475 \nplatform shoals; iron colloids, in the presence of plant remains derived from the 1476 \nadjacent floodplains, were precipitated in shallow lagoons. Reworking in a shallow, 1477 \nrestricted, partly anoxic tidal regime produced berthierine ooids interbedded with 1478 \nferruginous sandstones. An abundant benthic infauna resulted in intense bioturbation 1479 \nand mixing of the sandy sediments. In places, the underlying Toarcian sediments 1480 \nwere still poorly consolidated, enabling crustaceans to develop back-filled burrows 1481 \ninto the underlying muds.  1482 \n 1483 \n(d) Locally, the nearshore shallow lagoons became stagnant, resulting in deposition 1484 \nof laminated black mudstones. On adjacent highs, coeval sediments include trough 1485 \ncross-bedded sandstones with phosphatic pebble lags.  1486 \n 1487 \n(e) Southward and eastward advance of the rivers and deltas and high sediment flux 1488 \nfrom the doming hinterland resulted in infilling of the Dogger shelf, lower relative sea-1489 \nlevel and colonization of the floodplains by plants, resulting locally in rootlet 1490 \npenetration from plant-rich mires through to the Dogger sands.  Basin subsidence in 1491 \npost-Dogger, late Aalenian times was paced by uplift of the surrounding areas and a 1492 \nhigh siliciclastic sediment flux, so that the coastal plain remained above sea-level 1493 \nuntil the late Aalenian marine transgression (Eller Beck Formation) that advanced 1494 \nfrom the south (Fig. 4a).  1495 \n 1496 \n5.3. Mid-Jurassic paralic sedimentation in a rapidly subsiding basin: 1497 \ntransgressions versus regressions 1498 \n 1499 \nDifferential subsidence in the Cleveland Basin, as compared to the East Midlands 1500 \nShelf, was more pronounced from Aalenian to latest Bathonian times (175.6 \u2013 161.2 1501 \nMa), but was at its greatest during the early Bajocian to mid Bathonian, when up to 1502 \n300 m of fluvial, paralic and thin marine sediments were deposited (Ravenscar 1503 \nGroup). During this interval, however, sedimentation rates kept pace with subsidence 1504 \nto fill the available accommodation space. This balance of sedimentation versus 1505 \nsubsidence maintained the fluvial to paralic coastal plain in the region at or close to 1506 \nsea-level, so that relatively small increases in sea-level resulted in marine 1507 \ntransgressions across large parts of the basin or, in the case of the late Aalenian 1508 \nEller Beck Formation transgression and especially the Bajocian Scarborough 1509 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 41\nFormation transgression, throughout the whole basin. At other times, such as during 1510 \nthe early Bajocian Lebberston transgression, the northern part of the basin remained 1511 \nabove sea-level (Fig. 4b). 1512 \n 1513 \nThe Saltwick Formation was deposited in Murchisonae to Concavum zone 1514 \ntimes when paralic (i.e. fluvial, deltaic and brackish lagoonal) conditions were rapidly 1515 \nestablished throughout the basin as result of rapid uplift of the hinterland and high 1516 \nsediment flux from the north and west (Fig. 28). From the present-day coastal 1517 \nexposures to the western escarpment, muds and fluvial sands were deposited rapidly 1518 \nin river channel and interdistributary environments on the coastal plain, where the 1519 \ninterfluves were colonized by plants, locally forming peaty mires thick enough to form 1520 \nthin coals.   1521 \n 1522 \nThe Ravenscar Borehole (Fig. 26) illustrates a typical Saltwick succession; 1523 \ninitial progradation of muds and fine-grained sands across the low-gradient coastal 1524 \nplain, followed by progradational fluvial and deltaic sands in distributary channels. 1525 \nThese sand-dominated, stacked distributary channels pass upwards to an 1526 \ninterbedded mud and sand succession that illustrates a change to more isolated 1527 \nchannel sands, some meandering and laterally accreted, intercalated with marshy 1528 \noverbank muds, frequently colonized by a diverse plant assemblage (Murchison 1529 \n1832; Harris 1953; Morgans et al. 1999; van-Konijnenburg & Morgans 1999). Overall 1530 \nupward-fining of sediments in the borehole suggests rapid subsidence and high initial 1531 \nsedimentation rates, followed by a lowering of the geomorphological gradient, 1532 \nreduction in accommodation space and a resultant change to low-sinuosity 1533 \nmeandering streams. If this trend is true for the basin in general, the lowering of the 1534 \ngradient may reflect rising sea-level in late Aalenian times that peaked during the 1535 \nEller Beck marine transgression (Knox 1973; Powell & Rathbone 1983).  1536 \n 1537 \nThe transgressive Eller Beck Formation illustrates the subtle balance between 1538 \nparalic and fully marine environments across the basin (Fig. 4a). The sea advanced 1539 \nfrom the south across the Market Weighton High, depositing micritic lime mud in 1540 \nshallow lagoons; the resulting unit was formerly known as the Hydraulic Limestone. A 1541 \nmixed lime mud and ooidal, ferruginous sand lithofacies was deposited to the north, 1542 \nin the Hambleton Hills (Powell et al. 1992), marking a boundary with the ooidal 1543 \nironstone and ferruginous sand lithofacies to the north (Fig. 4a). Detailed 1544 \nsedimentological studies of the Eller Beck Formation (Knox 1970, 1973; Hemingway 1545 \n1974) show that the iron was derived in colloidal form from a lateritic hinterland 1546 \nsubject to warm, humid weathering, and was deposited in shallow lagoons under 1547 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 42\nanaerobic, reducing conditions (cf. Cleveland Ironstone, Dogger ironstone). Ooids 1548 \nindicate that the lagoons were influenced by tidal currents that resulted in oscillation 1549 \nand aggradation of individual berthierine (formerly chamosite) ooids. Dispersed ooids 1550 \nwere also incorporated into the overlying sand member that is characteristic of the 1551 \nupper part of the Eller Beck Formation. Palaeocurrent analysis (Knox 1973) suggests 1552 \ninflux of sand from the north that was reworked in a shallow shoreface and tidal 1553 \nregime in the north of the basin (e.g. Goathland [NZ 833 022]). Later, these marine 1554 \nferruginous sand lithofacies extended to the south of the Hambleton Hills where they 1555 \noverlie the earlier micritic limestone lithofacies (Powell & Rathbone 1983).  1556 \n 1557 \nThe gamma-ray log of the Ravenscar Borehole (Fig. 26) shows the lower part 1558 \nof the overlying Sycarham Member (Cloughton Formation) to be dominated by minor 1559 \nchannel sands and overbank coastal plain muds. However, the upper part of the 1560 \nSycarham succession is represented by a sharp-based sand unit marking a major 1561 \nprogradation of fluvio-deltaic sand. These sands represent stacked, erosively based 1562 \nchannels similar to those seen in the lower part of the Saltwick Formation at Whitby 1563 \nWest Cliff (Knox et al. 1991), and were deposited by a major river, at least in the 1564 \nRavenscar area (Alexander 1986). The major river channels may have been aligned, 1565 \nin this area, close to the axis of a major channel system that persisted through 1566 \nAalenian to early Bajocian times (Alexander 1986), although Hemingway (1974) 1567 \nproposed that the marked difference in the channel-sand dominance east and west 1568 \nof the Whitby Fault (trace of the River Esk) was due to later, probably Cenozoic 1569 \ntranscurrent fault movement. 1570 \n 1571 \nRelative sea-level rise in Laeviuscula Zone times (Butler et al. 2005) resulted 1572 \nin a second transgression and deposition of the Lebberston Member (Cloughton 1573 \nFormation), with lithofacies similar to those in the Eller Beck Formation, i.e. sands to 1574 \nthe north and carbonates to the south. However, the marine influence in the north of 1575 \nthe basin is much less pronounced, being restricted to thin ferruginous, locally shelly, 1576 \nsands and sideritic sands and thin limestone, as seen in coastal exposures 1577 \n(Cloughton Wyke and Yons Nab). This marine transgression advanced from the 1578 \nsouth. In the Howardian Hills, near Whitwell-on-the Hill, it is represented by ooidal 1579 \nand peloidal limestone (grainstone) up to 9 m thick, with an abundant shelly benthic 1580 \nfauna that includes the bryozoan Collapora [Haploecia] straminea; hence the local 1581 \nnames, Whitwell Oolite and Millepore Bed, \u2018millepore\u2019 being an early name given to 1582 \nthis bryozoan. Shallow tidal conditions are indicated by bi-directional cross-bedding, 1583 \nand in places colonial corals (Thamnasteria and Thecosmilia) are present with 1584 \nbivalves and gastropods. However, the Lebberston transgression was short lived as 1585 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 43\na result of progradation of fluvial and paralic sands and muds from the north. Based 1586 \non their ostracod faunas, the carbonates are thought to be of Discites Zone age, 1587 \nequivalent to the Lincolnshire Limestone carbonate platform of the East Midlands 1588 \nShelf (Bate 1964, 1967). On the coast, the transgressive and regressive lithofacies 1589 \ncan be clearly seen at Yons Nab [TA 084 844], where the carbonate-rich \u2018Millepore 1590 \nBed\u2019 is overlain by mudstones and sandstones with thin limestones termed the Yons 1591 \nNab Beds, with a marine fauna that includes crinoid ossicles, bivalves and ostracods 1592 \n(Bate 1959,1967; Whyte & Romano, 2006b). However, the marine beds disappear 1593 \nrapidly northwestwards along the coast, and this trend is paralleled inland where the 1594 \nLebberston Member thins northward from 9 m thick in the Howardian Hills to less 1595 \nthan 1 m in the Hambleton Hills, and cannot be traced north of a line from Whitby to 1596 \nOsmotherly (Hemingway 1974; Powell et al. 1992; Frost 1998). South of the Market 1597 \nWeighton High, the transgression is represented by the Cave Oolite [SE 91 31] 1598 \n(Neale 1958).  1599 \n 1600 \nLower delta plain environments with thin crevasse-splay sandstones and 1601 \nmuddy flood plain deposits, characterized by a \u2018saw-tooth\u2019 gamma ray profile, typify 1602 \nthe Gristhorpe Member (Cloughton Formation) in the Ravenscar Borehole (Fig. 26). 1603 \nDiverse and abundant plant remains have been described from the coastal plain and 1604 \ndelta top sediments (van Konijnenburg-Cittern & Morgans 1999).  Interfluves were 1605 \ncolonized by a very diverse fauna (up to 260 plant species identified), including 1606 \nhorsetails (Equisetum), ferns, conifers, cycads and tree ferns, with 15 species of 1607 \nGinkgo alone (Harris 1953).  Plants rapidly colonized the substrate and stabilized the 1608 \ninterfluves, resulting in high sinuosity and meandering channels. Classic localities at 1609 \nHayburn Wyke, Cloughton Wyke and Whitby are famous for the preservation of 1610 \ndrifted plants deposited in shallow, freshwater pools, and for rooted, in situ 1611 \nspecimens of Equisites (Black 1929; Harris 1953; van Konijnenburg-Cittern & 1612 \nMorgans 1999). Charcoal, in the form of fusain among the drifted plant remains, has 1613 \nbeen interpreted as evidence of forest fires that periodically destroyed the forest 1614 \ncanopy, and growth ring studies suggest that the climate was humid, sub-tropical and 1615 \nseasonal (Morgans et al. 1999; Hesselbo et al. 2003). Thin coals were developed on 1616 \nthe flood plain in shallow mires; downward penetrating rootlet traces and siliceous 1617 \nseat-earths resemble those more familiar in the Carboniferous Coal Measures 1618 \n(Fig.17f). These \u2018Moor Coals\u2019 were worked locally for use in smelting ironstone and in 1619 \nlime kilns (Wandlass & Slater 1938; Owen 1970b). Coals, with underlying rootlet 1620 \nbeds and seatearths, occur in the Cloughton Formation and Scalby Formation and 1621 \nhave been exploited inland from bell-pits and shafts such as Boars Gill [SE 5188 1622 \n8084] where black mudstone and coal in spoil from an old bell-pit indicates coal of 1623 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 44\nworkable thickness. Also, in the west of the  Asenby-Coxwold Graben, opencast coal 1624 \nexploration boreholes around Burtree House [SE 482 768] have confirmed the 1625 \npresence of the two coal seams worked in the late 18th century at the former Birdforth 1626 \nColliery (Fox-Strangways et al. 1886; Owen 1970a; Hemingway & Owen 1975).  1627 \nConnection with the open Tethys Ocean was only achieved during the 1628 \nScarborough Formation transgression (Bate 1965; Parsons 1977, 1980; Gowland & 1629 \nRiding 1991; Butler et al. 2005), a major sea-level rise in the early Bajocian. The 1630 \ncoastal type section at Hundale Point (Fig. 30) is dominated by mud- and sand-rich 1631 \nsediments with thin argillaceous limestones, subdivided into seven members 1632 \n(Gowland & Riding 1991). Ammonites such as Dorsetensia and Teloceras, and 1633 \nmarine palynomorphs in the Ravenscar Shale Member, indicate the Humphriesianum 1634 \nZone (mid Bajocian). In the coastal outcrop, marine siliciclastic sediments with 1635 \nhummocky cross-bedding (e.g. at Ravenscar cliff) and thin silty limestones that yield 1636 \nbivalves (Gervillella, Pseudomontis, Trigonia, Astarte and Lopha), belemnites and 1637 \nsparse ammonites, together with a diverse suite of shallow marine trace fossils 1638 \nincluding Rhizocorallium, Teichichnus and U-shaped Diplocraterion (Hemingway 1639 \n1974; Miller et al. 1984; Gowland & Riding 1991), suggest depositional conditions of 1640 \na littoral sandy embayment passing offshore to calcareous mud (Fig. 4c). A different 1641 \npalaeogeographical setting is suggested for the western outcrops of the Hambleton 1642 \nHills (Fig. 31), where peloidal (faecal peloids) planar cross-bedded limestone 1643 \n(Brandsby Roadstone) is overlain by medium-grained, fossiliferous sandstone 1644 \n(Crinoid Grit) (Powell et al. 1992). The limestone exhibits bi-directional planar cross-1645 \nbedding, suggesting deposition in a tidal lagoon.  The overlying sandstone also 1646 \nshows tidal influences such as bi-directional trough cross-bedding and current ripples 1647 \nwith surface Gyrochorte burrows (Powell 1992). The Scarborough Formation is 1648 \nabsent over the Market Weighton High, and the thicker ammonite-bearing marine 1649 \nmuds and sands (up to 20 m) on the coast suggest that the transgression came from 1650 \nthe east (open marine). The Hambleton Hills were the site of shallow, tidally 1651 \ninfluenced carbonate lagoons that gave way to shallow tidal marine sands derived 1652 \nfrom the north, a probable precursor to the influx of the fluvio-delatic system (Moor 1653 \nGrit Member and Scalby Formation) that unconformably overlies the Scarborough 1654 \nFormation over the whole of the basin. South of Scarborough, the formation thins to 6 1655 \nm at White Nab, 3 m at Yons Nab and Gristhorpe Bay [TA 085 842], but is only 1.5 m 1656 \nthick in the Fordon Borehole [TA 058 758], suggesting a shoreline to the south (Fig. 1657 \n4c).  1658 \n 1659 \nIt seems probable that there is a significant time gap at the base of the overlying 1660 \nMoor Grit Member (Scalby Formation). During this interval there was a lowering of 1661 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 45\nrelative sea-level, emergence of the basin, and erosion and uplift of the hinterland 1662 \nthat resulted in high sediment influx from the north, as indicated by the marked 1663 \nlithofacies changes at the Scarborough Formation-Moor Grit boundary across the 1664 \nbasin. The basal sand body of the fluvio-deltaic Scalby Formation is well exposed 1665 \nand best known from coastal outcrops (Cloughton Wyke and Black Rocks, 1666 \nScarborough). On the coast, the Moor Grit is characterized by a low gamma-ray 1667 \nsignature (Fig. 26) and typically comprises stacked sets of large-scale trough cross-1668 \nbedded, medium- to coarse-grained sandstone deposited by a large braided or low-1669 \nsinuosity river (Nami 1976; Nami & Leeder 1978; Leeder & Nami 1979; Livera & 1670 \nLeeder 1981; Kantorowicz 1985). Large-scale bedforms include laterally accreted 1671 \nchannel sandstones with log impressions and pebble lags indicating high current 1672 \nvelocities (Black 1928). In South Bay, Scarborough, and south of Hundale Point, 1673 \nsequentially stacked river channels pass up to mud-rich, level bedded units with only 1674 \noccasional laterally accreted channels (Nami & Leeder 1978). Interfluvial beds reveal 1675 \ntetrapod and sauropod dinosaur footprints (Hargreaves 1913; Sargeant 1970; Whyte 1676 \n& Romano 1993; Romano & Whyte 2003; Whyte & Romano, 2006a) and 1677 \n\u2018dinoturbation\u2019 structures that the latter authors attributed to large saurian reptiles 1678 \nproducing thixotropically contorted laminae below their footfalls (Fig. 27a).The 1679 \ncoarse-grained stacked channels in the Moor Grit are mostly confined to the coastal 1680 \nexposures orientated northwest-southeast, and palaeocurrent measurements 1681 \nsuggest a major river channel axis in this orientation, with sediment derived from the 1682 \nnorthwest and north. Elsewhere, the Moor Grit unit is definitely not a \u2018grit\u2019; for 1683 \ninstance in the Hambleton Hills, on the east of the outcrop, it comprises a texturally 1684 \nmature, fine- to medium-grained white sandstone, lacking major channels or laterally 1685 \naccreted bedforms (Powell et al. 1992). This tabular sand lithofacies was probably 1686 \ndeposited by sheetflows on the interfluves between the major fluvial channels seen in 1687 \nthe coastal exposures, which, though better known, are atypical. The texturally 1688 \nmature quartzitic sandstone of the inland outcrop suggests a distant provenance and 1689 \ndeposition by a major river system. Large-scale, stacked fluvial channels seen in the 1690 \nnorthwest trending coastal sections at Hundale Point and south of Scarborough may 1691 \nhave been controlled by subsidence associated with penecontemporaneous 1692 \nextensional subsidence within the Peak Trough. 1693 \n 1694 \nWaning river velocity and reduced sediment flux is clearly seen across the 1695 \nwhole basin in the upper part of the Scalby Formation. The upper \u2018level-bedded\u2019 Long 1696 \nNab Member is mudstone-dominated and is characterized by deposition in 1697 \nmeandering low-velocity rivers, muddy interfluves and fresh- to brackish-water lakes. 1698 \nNorth of Scalby Mills, the curved meander traces of point bar deposits (Nami & 1699 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 46\nLeeder 1978) can be clearly seen from the cliff top (Fig. 27b); cross-sections in the 1700 \ncliff reveal low angle, laterally accreted point bar sands and mud-filled abandoned 1701 \nchannels, together with laterally persistent thin sandstones with ripple marks 1702 \nrepresenting crevasse-splay and overbank deposits that accumulated in shallow 1703 \nfresh water and brackish lakes; sphaerosiderite is a common early diagenetic 1704 \nstructure in mud influenced by fluctuating, slightly acidic groundwaters (Kantorowicz 1705 \n1990).  1706 \n 1707 \nStudies of well-exposed sections of the Long Nab Member on the Yorkshire 1708 \ncoast (Black 1929; Leeder & Nami 1979) have concluded that it was deposited in a 1709 \nspectrum of sub-environments, including meandering channels, marshes and flood 1710 \nbasins on an alluvial plain.  However, subsequent reports of Ophiomorpha burrows, 1711 \ntogether with bioturbation and mud-grade sediments in channel-fill deposits (Livera & 1712 \nLeeder 1981), supported by the discovery of marine microplankton (Hancock & 1713 \nFisher 1981), have suggested at least some degree of marine influence.  On the 1714 \nbasis of detailed sedimentological and palynofacies investigations of the coastal 1715 \nsuccession, Fisher & Hancock (1985) reinterpreted the upper part of the Scalby 1716 \nFormation as a saline-influenced delta-plain, interrupted by small distributary 1717 \nchannels, some of which may have been tidal.  However, it is not known whether this 1718 \nmarine-influenced lithofacies extended over the whole of the basin, and based on the 1719 \nwestward marine incursions in the fully marine units such as the Scarborough 1720 \nFormation, it might have been restricted to the current-day coastal sections. 1721 \n 1722 \nA major sea-level rise in Callovian times (Herveyi Zone) resulted in marine 1723 \nincursion from the south and east across the Market Weighton High, flooding the low-1724 \ngradient coastal plain.  This major sequence boundary marks the demise of fluvial 1725 \nand deltaic sedimentation due to a world-wide sea-level rise (Haq et al. 1988) and 1726 \nincreased subsidence of the Pennine landmass. The lower Cornbrash Formation of 1727 \nsouthern England is absent (Page 1989), indicating that marine flooding of the 1728 \nCleveland Basin occurred slightly later during Herveyi Zone time.  Bioturbation in the 1729 \ntopmost Scalby mudstones and Rhizocorallium burrows that penetrate downwards 1730 \nfrom the berthierine ooidal limestone (Cornbrash Formation) (Wright 1977; Rawson & 1731 \nWright 2000) indicate that the sea transgressed rapidly across a still poorly lithified, 1732 \nlow-gradient coastal plain. The condensed succession represented by the Cornbrash 1733 \nlimestone with its abundant oysters (Lopha marshii) at Cayton Bay [TA 0765 8405] 1734 \nindicates low levels of sediment flux to the littoral coastal plain during the 1735 \ntransgression.  1736 \n 1737 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 47\n 1738 \n5.4 Mid-Late Jurassic carbonates, corals and ooid shoals  1739 \n 1740 \nThe high Middle and Upper Jurassic succession is characterized mostly by 1741 \ncalcareous sandstone and limestone that form the spectacular cliffs of Castle Hill, 1742 \nScarborough, the high ground of the North York Moors and, in the west, the 1743 \nescarpment of the Hambleton Hills.  The major sea-level rise in Callovian times 1744 \nmarked a return to marine sedimentation that continued for the remainder of the 1745 \nJurassic, about 20 million years, culminating in relatively deeper water sedimentation 1746 \nof the Kimmeridge Clay in a broad epeiric sea. The Callovian, Oxfordian and 1747 \nKimmeridgian succession is best known from the early pioneering studies of Fox-1748 \nStrangways (1892 and references therein), and from Arkell (1933, 1945) and the 1749 \nextensive publications of Wright (1968a, 1972, 1977, 1978, 1983, 1992, 1996a, 1750 \n1996b, 2009). Wright\u2019s detailed studies, and re-surveys of part of the Hambleton Hills 1751 \nby the BGS (Powell 1982, 1992) have demonstrated penecontemporaneous tectonic 1752 \nuplift and erosional unconformities in a seemingly conformable sequence (Coe 1995) 1753 \n(Figs 7, 33). Representative geophysical logs for the Hunmanby and Brown Moor 1754 \nboreholes, illustrating the lateral variation southwards towards the Market Weighton 1755 \nHigh, are shown in (Fig. 34).  1756 \n 1757 \nAs noted above, the Cornbrash Formation was deposited during the marine 1758 \ntransgression at the base of the Callovian Stage (Herveyi? Zone), but its absence 1759 \nfrom the outcrop in the Hambleton Hills (Senior 1975; Powell et al. 1992) suggests 1760 \nthat the initial marine transgression did not reach that far west. The overlying Cayton 1761 \nClay Formation, albeit thin over most of the basin, probably marks the maximum 1762 \nflooding across the fluvio-deltaic plain (Wright 1977; Senior 1975; Coe 1995). The 1763 \nonly exposure in the Hambleton Hills was in Northwoods Slack [SE 4982 8920], 1764 \nnoted by Fox-Strangways et al. (1886, p. 43). Senior (1975) logged sections through 1765 \nthis part of the sequence and noted that Fox-Strangway\u2019s locality was no longer 1766 \nexposed, but he recorded several small exposures of grey bioturbated, fossiliferous 1767 \nmudstone with bivalve fragments (c.1 m) at the base of the Osgodby Formation 1768 \nsandstone. 1769 \n 1770 \nThe overlying sandy marine Osgodby Formation, and the intra-formational tectonics 1771 \nthat resulted in its component members being separated by local unconformities, 1772 \nhave been described in detail by Wright (1968, 1978,1992). The unconformities at 1773 \nthe base of the Langdale Member and at the base of the Hackness Rock are well 1774 \ndeveloped on the coast between Castle Hill, Scarborough [TA 05 89] and Cunstone 1775 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 48\nNab [TA 10 83] (Wright 1968a, fig.3) and in the Hambleton Hills (Powell et al.1992).  1776 \nThe lower two members, the Redcliff Rock and overlying Langdale Member 1777 \nrepresent an upward coarsening succession deposited in a shallow-water, littoral 1778 \nenvironment, probably the subtidal shoreface zone  passing offshore to finer-grained 1779 \nsiliciclastics in the south-east of the basin.   1780 \n 1781 \nShallow marine siliciclastic sedimentation continued through the Callovian, 1782 \nbut was interrupted by tectonic events that caused gentle basinal uplift and flexure, 1783 \nnon-deposition and erosion, a precursor to early Oxfordian tectonics. Consequently, 1784 \nsome of the Callovian ammonite zones are missing. In the Hambleton Hills, the 1785 \nLangdale Member of the Osgodby Formation (Wright 1978) is absent, so the upper 1786 \nmember of the formation, the Hackness Rock (Athleta-Lamberti zones) rests 1787 \nunconformably on the Red Cliff Rock Member (Koenigi Zone) with strata representing 1788 \nup to three ammonite zones missing. Callovian to early Oxfordian uplift and erosion 1789 \nis manifested in the area between Whitestone Cliff and Raven\u2019s Gill (Fig. 33), where 1790 \nthe Oxford Clay and underlying Hackness Rock are cut out by a low-angle, 1791 \noverstepping unconformity at the base of the Lower Calcareous Grit (see below).  1792 \n 1793 \nA global rise in sea-level in Late Jurassic times (Cope et al. 1992; Haq et al. 1794 \n1988) is marked in the Cleveland Basin by the change in facies at the base of the 1795 \nOxford Clay (Weymouth Member, Mariae Zone), which represents deeper water 1796 \nsedimentation and a continuation of the major marine transgression that began in the 1797 \nCallovian Stage.  The later arrival of Oxford Clay lithofacies in the Cleveland Basin, 1798 \ncompared to the East Midland Shelf, was due to lower subsidence rates north of the 1799 \nMarket Weighton High. Furthermore, the global eustatic sea-level rise in north-west 1800 \nEurope (Hallam 1975, 1988; Haq et al. 1988) was interrupted in the Cleveland Basin 1801 \nby a regressive low sea-level stand during deposition of the Corallian Group. 1802 \n 1803 \nEarly Oxfordian sedimentation (Oxford Clay and Lower Calcareous Grit) 1804 \nrepresents an upward coarsening (shallowing) succession consisting of grey-green 1805 \nmudstone and silty mudstone passing gradationally up to calcareous siltstone and 1806 \nsandy limestone. The benthic fauna of the Oxford Clay includes sparse, small 1807 \nbivalves (Meleagrinella sp., Oxytoma sp., Gryphaea sp., Nuculoma sp. and 1808 \nRollierella sp.) and the gastropod Dicroloma sp. The fine-grained lithology of that 1809 \nformation, the absence of current structures, the paucity of its benthic fauna, and the 1810 \npresence, locally, of a nektonic fauna that includes belemnites (Hibolites sp.) and 1811 \nammonites (Quenstedtoceras mariae (d\u2019Orbigny), Cardioceras scarburgense (Young 1812 \nand Bird) and Peltoceras (Parawedekendia) sp.), all suggest an offshore, moderately 1813 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 49\ndeep-water environment of deposition. However, some beds, especially in the lower 1814 \npart, are heavily bioturbated, with abundant Chondrites burrows and Planolites 1815 \nburrows, indicating an oxygenated sea-floor. 1816 \n 1817 \nIn the Hambleton Hills, the marked local unconformity below the Lower 1818 \nCalcareous Grit reflects the continuation of tectonic activity that resulted in 1819 \ndepositional hiatuses during the Callovian (Fig. 7).  This is most pronounced in the 1820 \nsouth-east of the Hambleton Hills, where uplift and tilting of the Roulston Scar \u2018block\u2019 1821 \nresulted in the Lower Calcareous Grit resting unconformably (overstep) on the Red 1822 \nCliff Rock (Osgodby Formation) (Figs 7, 33). The absence of the Oxford Clay 1823 \nbetween Sutton Bank and Raven\u2019s Gill along the main escarpment, and also at Hood 1824 \nHill [SE 504 813], demonstrates uplift and subsequent sub-marine erosion of the 1825 \nOxford Clay, and in places the Hackness Rock, prior to deposition of the Oldstead 1826 \nOolite, the ooidal limestone developed locally at the base of the Lower Calcareous 1827 \nGrit (Wright 1983; Powell et al. 1992).  This area appears to have been an uplifted 1828 \nblock, tilted gently towards the north, since the Oxford Clay thins gradually 1829 \nsouthwards towards Roulston Scar [SE 5110 8153], but is present between Raven\u2019s 1830 \nGill and Shaw\u2019s Gill, where a penecontemporaneous post Oxford Clay-pre Lower 1831 \nCalcareous Grit fault is invoked (Fig. 33). Uplift and erosion must have been short-1832 \nlived because the Oxford Clay and the overlying Lower Calcareous Grit have yielded 1833 \nammonites of the Mariae Zone and Cordatum Zone (Bukowskii Subzone), 1834 \nrespectively, in the Shaw\u2019s Gill area [SE 507 834] (Powell 1982; Powell et al. 1992, 1835 \nfig. 18).  Clay pellets in the unconsolidated sand at the top of the Redcliff Rock 1836 \nbetween Whitestone Cliff and Raven\u2019s Gill may have been derived from the Oxford 1837 \nClay during the erosive phase that removed both the Oxford Clay and the Hackness 1838 \nRock and reworked the top of the Redcliff Rock (Powell 1982).  The unconformity is 1839 \nequivalent to five ammonite zones and represents rapid erosion of marine mud and 1840 \nsand representing a considerable time span (Cope et al. 1980b, fig. 8).  1841 \n 1842 \nA broad, shallow carbonate platform was established across the Cleveland 1843 \nBasin area during mid Oxfordian times, contrasting with more rapid subsidence and 1844 \ndeeper water sedimentation across the East Midlands Shelf. The spicule-rich 1845 \ncalcareous sandstones and micritic, bioclastic, reefal and ooidal limestones that 1846 \ncomprise the Corallian Group (70 to 150 m) were deposited in a warm, shallow sea 1847 \nduring a relative sea-level low stand.  1848 \n 1849 \nWhere the Oxford Clay is present, away from the Roulston Scar \u2018block\u2019, the 1850 \ngradational upward-coarsening across the boundary between the Oxford Clay  and 1851 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 50\nthe Lower Calcareous Grit,, together with the shelly benthic fauna, abundant sponge 1852 \nspicules and Thalassinoides burrows in the latter suggest sedimentation under 1853 \nshallower water conditions than prevailed during deposition of the underlying Oxford 1854 \nClay. The paucity of small-scale sedimentary structures in the Lower Calcareous Grit  1855 \nis due to intense bioturbation of the substrate soon after deposition; Thalassinoides 1856 \nburrows with a higher spicule content are well preserved on bedding planes, but 1857 \nintense bioturbation within individual beds has produced a homogeneous fabric.  1858 \nDespite the general absence of primary current structures, the lithological and faunal 1859 \ncharacteristics indicate deposition in shallow to moderate depths (c. 10 to 30 m) in 1860 \nthe offshore zone. 1861 \n 1862 \nDevelopment of the Oldstead Oolite Member (Wright 1980; Powell et al. 1863 \n1992) at the base of the formation near Roulston Scar [SE 5156 8121 to 5327 8206] 1864 \nwas probably due to the development of a shallow water ooidal shoal lithofacies on a 1865 \nsub-marine high that developed in response to the local tectonic uplift this area (see 1866 \nabove), the Oldstead Oolite being deposited in turbulent conditions on the south-1867 \neastern flanks of the Roulston Scar \u2018block\u2019, which formed the palaeohigh.  Cross-1868 \nbedding, ooidal grainstone texture and basal erosional scours indicate shoaling 1869 \nconditions, within wave-base.  A decrease in the proportion of ooids (wackestone 1870 \ntexture) at the top of the member suggests gradually increasing water depths through 1871 \ntime during the deposition of the Lower Calcareous Grit. 1872 \n 1873 \nShallowing of the sea, with a change in benthos (sparse Rhaxella spicules) 1874 \nand the development of dynamic, tidally influenced ooidal shoals, is reflected in the 1875 \noverlying Coralline Oolite Formation. The lowermost member, the Hambleton Oolite, 1876 \nhas a gradational base and in places passes laterally into spiculitic calcareous 1877 \nsandstone of the Birdsall Calcareous Grit (Wright 1972), indicating the lateral 1878 \ndiscontinuity of migrating ooid shoals and passage offshore to siliciclastic lithofacies.  1879 \nThis relationship reflects the original depositional environment of migrating ooidal 1880 \nshoals passing into slightly deeper water environments typified by the spiculitic sand 1881 \n\u2018background\u2019 sedimentation. 1882 \n 1883 \nDetailed studies of the Corallian succession in the Howardian Hills by Wright 1884 \n(2009) have shown that the broadly east-west fault system in the Howardian Hills and 1885 \nVale of Pickering was locally tectonically active during the mid Oxfordian (c.f. 1886 \nRoulston Scar in the Hambleton Hills). Penecontemporaneous extensional 1887 \nmovement on the Coxwold-Gilling faults resulted, locally, in marked changes in 1888 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 51\nthickness and lithofacies with areas of uplift and erosion along the Corallian ridge 1889 \nnotably at Gilling East and between Malton and North Grimston (Wright 2009, fig. 13) 1890 \n 1891 \nThe distribution of lithologies, fauna and facies suggest that the Coralline 1892 \nOolite Formation was deposited in a warm shallow sea that covered an extensive 1893 \ncarbonate platform, across which ooid shoals prograded offshore (south-eastwards) 1894 \nfrom the nearshore zone situated to the north of the district.  Micritic carbonates 1895 \ndeveloped in sheltered lagoons that were protected, in part, by coral-algal patch reefs 1896 \nduring deposition of the Coral Rag Member (Reeves et al. 1978).  Intercalation of 1897 \nooidal carbonates and calcareous sandstones in the lower part of the formation, and 1898 \nlateral passage to increasingly siliciclastic-dominated lithofacies to the south-west, 1899 \nsuggest a south-easterly transition from nearshore to offshore zones. 1900 \n 1901 \nOoidal limestone (packstone to grainstone texture) lithofacies (e.g. Hambleton 1902 \nOolite) with a variable proportion of quartz sand and fragmented shells are typified by 1903 \ncross-bedding and shallow scours. Multidirectional cross-bedding azimuths suggest 1904 \nthat the oolite shoals were deposited in an oscillating tidal current regime. Soft-1905 \nsediment deformation structures, such as the slump structures and injection 1906 \nphenomena locally present at Shaw\u2019s Gate Quarry [SE 5233 8236] and Old Byland 1907 \nGrange Quarry [SE 5454 8567] in the Hambleton Hills, might have resulted from the 1908 \ndisplacement of pore-waters held in the semi-lithified sediments during seismic 1909 \nactivity associated with local tectonic uplift in the Roulston Scar area in early 1910 \nOxfordian times. However, some of the convoluted sandy beds, particularly the basal 1911 \nbed at Shaw\u2019s Gate Quarry, have features such as convoluted clasts, erosive bases 1912 \nand planar, truncated, upper bedding surfaces, that indicate deposition as submarine 1913 \ndebris flows. 1914 \n 1915 \nTemporal relationships between the ooidal (Hambleton Oolite Member) and 1916 \nvariably spiculitic calcareous sandstone (e.g. Birdsall Calcareous Grit Member) 1917 \nlithofacies in the Hambleton Hills are difficult to resolve because of the paucity of 1918 \nammonite faunas.  The overall lithofacies distribution of these two members, as 1919 \ndeduced from their outcrop pattern, indicates a depositional environment ranging 1920 \nfrom shallow-water ooid shoals in the north of the Cleveland Basin, interdigitating 1921 \nwith, and passing offshore to marine siliciclastics towards the south-east. Similar 1922 \nlithofacies have been described from the modern-day Great Bahama Bank, Andros 1923 \nIsland and the Arabian Gulf (Purdy 1963; Bathurst 1975, p.135; Black 1980; Hine et 1924 \nal. 1981). The lithological characteristics of the ooid lithofacies, taken together with 1925 \nthe low-dipping, multidirectional cross-bedding and shallow scours, suggest periodic 1926 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 52\nmigration of oolitic shoals on a shallow-water carbonate platform, influenced by 1927 \nwaves and oscillating tidal currents. Sparse vertical burrows indicate temporary 1928 \nstability of the substrate that allowed colonization by infauna. 1929 \n 1930 \nThe pattern of fluctuating sea-level is repeated with deposition of the Middle 1931 \nCalcareous Grit Member, Malton Oolite Member and Coral Rag Member which 1932 \ntogether form the second upwards shallowing cycle in the Corallian Group. Shell 1933 \nbeds composed of Myophorella hudlestoni in the Middle Calcareous Grit (Vertebrale 1934 \nSubzone; Wright 1980), together with Rhizocorallium burrows and cross-bedding, 1935 \nsuggest a high-energy, shallow-marine environment of deposition (Hemingway 1936 \n1974).  The shoaling cycle is capped by the Malton Oolite and Coral Rag members. 1937 \nLarge-scale foresets and a paucity of benthic faunas in the Malton Oolite indicate 1938 \nlarge mobile laterally migrating ooidal shoals, similar to parts of the present-day 1939 \nBahama Banks (Twombley 1964), formed during strong flood and ebb storm surges 1940 \nand preserved as mega-dune foresets.  The Coral Rag comprises locally developed 1941 \ncoral-algal patch reefs, coral-shell inter-reef debris, and micritic limestone deposited 1942 \nin back-reef lagoons. 1943 \n 1944 \nAs sea-level rose towards the end of Corallian Group deposition, the Upper 1945 \nCalcareous Grit Formation was deposited in slightly deeper water across the Market 1946 \nWeighton High and northwards into the Cleveland Basin. Very fine- to fine-grained, 1947 \nhighly calcareous, spiculitic sand and silt, with abundant beds of clayey lime-mud in 1948 \nthe middle of the unit, was deposited in moderate depths on the shelf in nearshore to 1949 \noffshore environments.  Increased rates of subsidence and global sea-level rise 1950 \naround Serratum Zone time resulted in \u2018drowning\u2019 of the shallow siliciclastic and 1951 \ncarbonate platform, with the deposition of mud (Ampthill Clay and Kimmeridge Clay) 1952 \nin deeper water environments. 1953 \n 1954 \n 1955 \n5.5 Late Jurassic global sea-level rise and sea-floor anoxia 1956 \n 1957 \nGlobal sea-level rise during the late Oxfordian is manifested in the Ampthill and 1958 \nKimmeridge Clay formations, which are the youngest Jurassic units in the Cleveland 1959 \nBasin. The marked change in lithofacies from shallow-water carbonates and 1960 \nnearshore siliciclastics, represented by the uppermost Corallian Group, to oxic 1961 \nshallow marine mudstones with thin carbonate beds and nodules (Ampthill Clay), 1962 \npassing upward to organic-rich mudstones (Kimmeridge Clay), reflects subsidence of 1963 \nthe Cleveland Basin and deeper-water conditions during late Oxfordian and 1964 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 53\nKimmeridgian times. Infaunal and epifaunal bivalves, gastropods and echinoid spines 1965 \nsuggest that the Ampthill Clay was deposited in an oxic shallow marine environment. 1966 \nOxic and anoxic (organic-rich) bottom conditions then alternated as the platform 1967 \nsubsided during deposition of the Kimmeridge Clay; pelagic and hemipelagic muds 1968 \nwere deposited from suspension across the former platform and into the current-day 1969 \nNorth Sea, in response to a major worldwide sea-level rise (Haq et al. 1988). Muds 1970 \nwere deposited in rhythms indicating fluctuating relatively oxic and anoxic bottom 1971 \nconditions. The geophysical logs of the Hunmanby Borehole (Cox & Gallois 1981; 1972 \nWhittaker et al. 1985) illustrate the \u2018saw-tooth\u2019, small-scale sedimentary rhythms (Fig. 1973 \n38). These couplets comprise brown-black, bituminous fissile mudstone (anoxic; 1974 \nkerogen-rich) and overlying medium-grey and pale grey calcareous mudstone (oxic). 1975 \nAnoxic and oxic sea-bed conditions are indicated by fossil associations with 1976 \nincreased levels of bioturbation and infaunal bivalves during more oxic periods 1977 \n(Wignall 1990). Free-swimming fauna such as ammonites, fish and marine reptiles 1978 \nwere preserved after death during periods of sea-floor anoxia, resulting in their 1979 \nexceptional preservation.  Restricted circulation and high organic productivity in the 1980 \nTethys Ocean during the late Kimmeridgian (post-Eudoxus Zone) led to deposition 1981 \nand preservation under anoxic bottom conditions of organic-walled phytoplankton, 1982 \nwhich following burial in the northern North Sea Basin and the formation of kerogen, 1983 \ngenerated hydrocarbons (Gallois 1976; Herbin et al. 1993). Earlier depositional 1984 \nmodels attributed the high organic content to high-levels of phytoplankton productivity 1985 \n(algal blooms) (Gallois 1976). However, Weedon et al. (2004) calculated the organic 1986 \nproductivity over time and concluded that the \u2018Kimmeridge sea\u2019 was no more 1987 \nproductive than modern-day continental shelves, and consequently that the high 1988 \norganic content (3.8% Total Organic Carbon) was due to a dilution or absence of 1989 \nterrigenous siliciclastics sediment entering a semi-restricted basin. If this was the 1990 \ncase, it suggests a geomorphologically subdued hinterland with very little erosion of 1991 \nterrigenous material, perhaps akin to the southern margins of the present-day 1992 \nArabian Gulf, but with more anoxic bottom conditions (cf. the Black Sea).  1993 \n 1994 \nThe non-turbulent and cyclical anoxic bottom conditions resulted in fine 1995 \npreservation of ammonites such as Amoeboceras sp. (Ampthill Clay), Pictonia sp., 1996 \nAulacostephanus fallax and Rasenia evolata, and these have enabled detailed 1997 \nbiostratigraphical zonation and correlation with the North Sea and Europe (Herbin et 1998 \nal. 1995). The Kimmeridge Clay cycles have been attributed to astronomical 1999 \n(Milankovitch) cycles (Weedon et al. 1999; Weedon et al. 2004) with the larger (2-4 2000 \nm wavelengths) representing orbital obliquity (c. 41,000 year periodicity) and the 2001 \nsmaller wavelength cycles (1-2 m wavelengths) to precession cycles (c. 26,000 year 2002 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 54\nperiodicity). Studies based on sequence stratigraphy (Wignall 1991; Taylor et al. 2003 \n2001; Williams et al. 2001) have recognized between 9 and 11 depositional cycles in 2004 \nthe North Sea and adjacent areas, with silt-dominated units in the centre of the basin 2005 \nrepresenting lowstand conditions during which siliciclastic sediment by-passed the 2006 \nshallow shelf.  The thin and siltier succession through the Elegans to Wheatleyensis 2007 \nzones may have represented significantly shallower basin conditions than during the 2008 \nearlier Mutabilis to Eudoxus zones (Fig. 38). During the late Kimmeridgian (Bolonian 2009 \nof Cope 1993), this upward shallowing trend is reflected in the Late Cimmerian 2010 \ntectonic uplift (Rawson & Riley 1982) that resulted in a basin wide sea-level fall. 2011 \n 2012 \nWater depth and depositional conditions for the Kimmeridge Clay have been 2013 \nthe topic of much debate (Cope 2006). Early workers (Irwin 1979; Tyson et al. 1979; 2014 \nMyers & Wignall 1987) postulated relatively deep water and fluctuating oxic-anoxic 2015 \nconditions on the sea-floor as the oxic-anoxic boundary migrated vertically above and 2016 \nbelow the sediment-water interface. Wignall (1989) also proposed that storm events 2017 \nripped up intraclasts and fine-grained clastic sediments, which were re-deposited in 2018 \ndeeper parts of the basin, thereby oxygenating the bottom sediments. This implies 2019 \nthat water depths, at least at the basin margins, were within storm-wave base (c. 30 2020 \nm depth).  It is generally accepted that the \u2018Kimmeridge Basin\u2019 was \u2018restricted\u2019 2021 \nrelative to full ocean circulation to some degree, and some authors (Hallam 1975; 2022 \nAigner 1980) proposed deposition in stagnant conditions of shallow water depths of 2023 \nabout 10 m rather than the c. 100 m or so postulated by Tyson et al. (1979) and 2024 \nothers.   2025 \n 2026 \nThe unconformity between the Kimmeridge and Speeton clays was a result of 2027 \nlatest Jurassic sea-level fall (Haq et al. 1988) coupled with the Late Cimmerian earth 2028 \nmovements (Rawson & Riley 1982) that led to a tensional (rifting) tectonic phase 2029 \nduring latest Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous times, probably in response to sea-floor 2030 \nspreading in the Atlantic Ocean (Rawson 2006).  2031 \n 2032 \n6. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER STUDY 2033 \n 2034 \nThe Jurassic Cleveland Basin, by virtue of its diverse lithofacies, tectonic evolution, 2035 \nexcellent coastal exposures and analogues to North Sea hydrocarbon plays, is one 2036 \nof the most studied sedimentary basins in NW Europe. Pioneering research in the 2037 \ngeological sciences, supported through the Yorkshire Philosophical Society (later the 2038 \nYorkshire Geological Society), were stimulated by the early researches by William 2039 \nSmith and his nephew John Phillips. Later academic and practical studies on the 2040 \nJurassic of the Cleveland Basin: a review  Presidential Address Yorkshire Geological Society \nJ H Powell version 3(3). 10\/08\/2010 55\ncoast (e.g. Young & Bird 1822; Phillips 1829, 1858), combined with the search for 2041 \nenergy and industrial minerals (coal, ironstone, alum, jet, building stone and 2042 \naggregates) in the 18th and 19th centuries, paved the way for the Geological Survey 2043 \nPrimary Survey at \u20186 inches-to-the-mile scale\u2019 by Fox-Strangways and Barrow in the 2044 \nlate 19th century, which laid the foundations to our understanding of the basin in its 2045 \nbroadest context.  2046 \n 2047 \nOur knowledge has been refined over the last 100 years or so through the 2048 \nadvent of high resolution biostratigraphy, geochemistry, sedimentology and 2049 \nsequence stratigraphy, heavy mineral studies, and more recently cyclostratigraphy 2050 \nand stable isotope geochemistry, techniques that may lead to an astronomical 2051 \ntimescale for the deeper water marine successions. Academic research has 2052 \nfocussed on the well-exposed coastal sections, but new data is still emerging from 2053 \ndetailed studies of the inland exposures and deep hydrocarbons boreholes. The 2054 \nlatter, combined with detailed biostratigraphy and stable isotope geochemical 2055 \nstudies, are likely to provide a better understanding of the influence of the Earth\u2019s 2056 \norbit and Milankovitch cylicity on sedimentation and diagenesis. These advances will 2057 \nno doubt lead to a better understanding of the palaeoceanography, sedimentation 2058 \nand evolution of the Cleveland Basin. However, there is still a place for detailed 2059 \ngeological mapping, three-dimensional modelling and multidisciplinary 2060 \nsedimentological\/petrological\/biostratigraphical studies of parts of the succession that 2061 \nwe still do not fully understand, such as the origin of the Jurassic ironstones, the 2062 \nnature of sea-bed anoxia, palaeoceanography, the influence of the Howardian-2063 \nFlamborough Fault Belt on Jurassic sedimentation north of the Market Weighton 2064 \nHigh, intra-Jurassic tectonics, palaeoclimates and atmospheric gasses, and the 2065 \nevolution of flora and fauna. These and no doubt many new, avenues of research will 2066 \nensure that the Cleveland Basin remains a focus of geological research and training, 2067 \nthereby attracting leading international scientists to reveal more about this fascinating 2068 \nperiod of Earth\u2019s history \u2013 here in Yorkshire!    2069 \n 2070 \n 2071 \nc.22 k words 2072 \n 2073 \nAcknowledgements 2074 \nI thank Peter Rawson and my colleagues at the British Geological Survey, especially 2075 \nStewart Molyneux and Andy Howard, for their helpful comments.
