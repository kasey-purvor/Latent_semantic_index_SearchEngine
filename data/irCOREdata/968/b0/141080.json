Introduction\n1.1 Background\nPost-combustion capture by chemical absorption using MEA solvent remains one of the most popular\ntechnologies available for significant reduction in CO2 emissions. It offers advantages over other CO2\ncapture approaches in effecting significant CO2 emission reductions as it is a suitable technology for\nretrofitting of existing power generation plants. It is also well suited for treating flue gas streams with low\nCO2 partial pressures typical of coal-fired power plants.\nAmongst stationary anthropogenic sources of CO2 emissions, fossil-fuelled power plants release the largest\namounts of CO2. Coal-fired power plants release twice as much CO2 per unit of electricity generated as\ntheir natural gas counterparts and are generally less efficient. However, these plants offer some advantages\nto operators due to the relatively high availability of coal compared to other fuels. Projections from the\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA) suggest the continued use of coal especially in light of increasing\nelectricity demand [1]. In addition, coal-fired power plants can be operated flexibly in response to changes\nin supply and demand [2] which provides great advantage to the operator.\nThis study investigates the operation of coal-fired power plants with post-combustion capture using\ndynamic modelling and simulation. Several authors have studied the reduction in the overall efficiency of\nthe power generation process due to the large energy requirements of chemical absorption of CO2 on a\nsteady-state basis [3-6]. However, these studies thus assume that the power plant operates continuously at\nbase load conditions. Such studies cannot provide insight into plant performance during certain operations\nsuch as start-up, load variations and other disturbances. Accurate dynamic models are required to study this\nbehaviour.\n* Corresponding author.

[8] also discusses\ndifferent types of models used for modelling reactive absorption and the developments made in this regard.\n[9] describes the dynamic model development and simulation of the regenerator only while [10] extends\nthis to the two stand-alone columns. Analysis on stand-alone columns may be inaccurate due to the\ninevitable coupling of the two columns linked with a recycle loop. This study presents dynamic modelling\nand simulation of the CO2 chemical absorption plant that is the absorber and regenerator linked together\nwith recycle. As a result the dynamic interaction between the absorber and regenerator could be studied\nmore accurately through dynamic analysis. This work presents dynamic analyses\na. The effect of reducing flue gas flow rate to the absorption process\nb. The effect of reducing reboiler heat duty\nc. The effect of increasing CO2 concentration in the flue gas to absorber\n2. Operation of the CO2 chemical absorption plant and Grid Code Requirements\nChemical absorption is a reactive absorption process and involves the combination of mass transfer and\nchemical reaction of CO2 with a chemical solvent to form a weakly bonded intermediate compound which\nmay be regenerated with the application of heat producing the original solvent and a CO2 stream [11,12].\nMonoethanolamine (MEA) being a primary amine reacts with CO2 to produce carbamate via sets of liquid\nphase reactions [5,13].\nFigure 1 Simplified process flow diagram of Chemical Absorption process for post-combustion capture\nfrom [7]\nFigure 1 describes a typical chemical absorption plant. The facility consists of two main units \u2013 the\nabsorber and regenerator columns which could be packed or tray columns. Flue gas from the power plant is\ncontacted counter-currently with lean MEA solution in the absorber. MEA chemically absorbs CO2 in the\nflue gas. This leaves a treated gas stream of much lower CO2 content. The solvent solution (now Rich\nMEA) is regenerated in the regenerator column using steam derived from the power generation process.\nThis steam is proposed to be extracted between the intermediate pressure and low pressure turbines. CO2\nfrom the top of the column is compressed and transported away while the lean (regenerated) MEA solution\nis returned to the absorber column completing the cycle.\nSystem frequency in a Grid is determined by a balance in system demand and total power generation.\nWhen the demand rises above the power generated, the frequency drops and vice versa. The UK Grid Code\ndemands relatively strict minimum requirements for primary frequency response in power generation.\nPower plants are required to increase their output by 10% over a 10-second period. Secondary response\nrefers to the requirement of output increase between 30s and 30 minutes [14]. One reason why subcritical\npower plants can meet the UK Grid requirements is that they have boiler drums and as such have a large\nAbsorber\nFlue Gas\nfrom power\nplant\nLean MEA\nRich MEA Cross Heat\nExchanger\nRegenerator\nCO2 to\ncompression\nCondenser\nTreated Gas\nReboiler\nSteam from\npower plant\namount of stored energy. Higher efficiency supercritical boilers do not have drums and therefore it may be\nharder for them to meet Grid requirements. There are therefore concerns that these supercritical plants may\nnot be able to meet the primary response requirement of the UK Grid Code [14]. In such a situation, some\nbenefits may accrue from addition of a post-combustion plant downstream the power plant as the steam\nsupplied to the reboiler could be reduced to make more steam available for power generation thus aiding\nprimary response. It is, therefore, important to understand the behaviour of the absorption process with\nsuch a reduction. Storage of rich amine solvent could enable this to be done without a drop in CO2 capture\nrates. In addition, the flue gas supplied to the absorption process may vary in flow rate or composition as\nthe power plant operates in varying load conditions. This paper therefore studies the dynamic response of\nthe CO2 chemical absorption plant to investigate its behaviour with disturbances from the upstream power\nplant.\nIn Section 5, three dynamic cases describe how disturbances from the power generation process affect the\noperation of the CO2 chemical absorption plant \u2013 the first deals with increased flue gas flow rate to the\nabsorber. This mimics a secondary response scenario. The second mimics a possible primary response\nscenario where there is reduced steam flow available for regeneration. The third looks at a less\nconventional case where there is an increased concentration of CO2 in the flue gas from the power\ngeneration process. This would be the outcome of a partial O2-fired coal power plant with post-combustion\ncapture [15].\n3. Model development\nThis section describes development of the whole plant model. Common to both absorber and regenerator\ncolumns is the packed column section. These two columns were modelled based on the Gas-Liquid\nContactor model from Process Systems Enterprise\u2019s Advanced Model Library. Two phenomena determine\nthe rates of CO2 absorption and solvent regeneration \u2013 mass transfer and chemical reaction. Mass transfer\nrates were modelled based on the two-film theory (Figure 2) using the Maxwell-Stefan formulation hence\nthe models are referred to as \u201crate-based models\u201d. Heat and mass transfer resistances are modelled in the\nliquid and vapour films. Mass transfer coefficients in the liquid and vapour films were determined by\ncorrelations given by Onda et al [16]. The diffusivity (\u03c7) of CO2 in the liquid phase was based on\nexpressions provided by Vaidya et al [17]. The diffusivity (\u03c7) of CO2 and other components in the vapour\nphase was estimated using the Fuller\u2019s equation [18]. Expressions for the heat of absorption were obtained\nfrom literature [19].\nThe regenerator model consists of the Gas-Liquid Contactor model (for the packed column section) linked\nwith two flash drum models which represent the condenser and reboiler of the unit.\nIn the absorber, it is assumed that there is no heat lost to the surroundings. Due to its relatively higher\noperating temperature, the regenerator energy balance includes a heat loss term. Heat loss was assumed\nconstant along the height of the column. The total heat loss from the column was estimated using relations\ngiven by [20].\nFigure 2 Liquid and vapour bulks, films and interface\nvapour liquid\nLb\nix\nLI\nix\nVI\nix\ninterface\nliquid bulk phasevapour bulk phase\niN\nLf\uf064Vf\uf064\nVb\nix\n0'\uf03dzVFz \uf064\uf03d' LFz \uf064\uf03d'\n'z 'z\nVF\nLF\ny\n3.1Model Assumptions\nThe following assumptions were used in developing this dynamic model:\n1 All reactions are assumed to attain equilibrium\n2 Plug flow regime and linear pressure drop along the column\n3 Phase equilibrium at interface between liquid and vapour films\n4 Negligible holdup in the vapour bulk\n5 Negligible solvent degradation\n6 Negligible heat loss in the absorber column\n7 Chemical reactions are assumed to reach equilibrium in the condenser and reboiler.\n3.2 Model Equations\nMore details of the absorber dynamic model are described in [8] while regenerator dynamic model is\nfurther described in [10].

PI controllers are used for temperature control of the\nregenerator column. The temperatures of the top and bottom of the regenerator are manipulated using the\ncondenser and reboiler heat duties. The temperature of the regenerated solvent determines its CO2 loading\nand thus affects its absorption capacity. Thus the temperature of the solvent from the reboiler bottoms must\nbe maintained at desired levels.\nThe reboiler level was controlled using a P controller by manipulating the reboiler bottoms flow rate.\nWater balance is achieved by controlling the water mass fraction in the lean solvent with the water makeup\nflow rate used as manipulated variable. The Lean MEA stream consists of 30.48wt% MEA, 6.18wt% CO2\nwhich leaves a 63.34 wt% H2O. The set point for the mass fraction of lean solvent was therefore set as\n0.6334.\nThe cross heat exchanger was sized to yield the reported regenerator feed temperature and a temperature\napproach of over 15\u00b0C. The cooler upstream the Lean MEA tank is specified to have a constant outlet\ntemperature. The pressure of the partial condenser is also assigned to maintain the column operating\npressure. The Rich MEA from absorber pump is specified to deliver the differential pressure between the\nabsorber and regenerator including the pressure drops of the equipment in between.\nTable 1 Process Controllers\nControlled Variable Manipulated Variable Set point (K)\nCondenser Temperature\nController\nCondenser temperature Condenser heat duty 320\nReboiler Temperature\nController\nReboiler temperature Reboiler heat duty 387\nReboiler Level\nController\nReboiler level Reboiler bottoms flow\nrate\n0.50\nWater Makeup\nController\nWater mass fraction in\nlean solvent\nWater Makeup flow 0.6334\n3.4 Model Topology\nAssumptions for Model Topology\n1.

To achieve water balance, lean amine solvent from the regenerator is fed into the Lean MEA\ntank where water is made up before being pumped to the absorber\nFigure 3 Model topology in gPROMS\n4. Model Validation\nThe validation of the chemical absorption plant model was carried out using data from the Separations\nResearch Program at the University of Texas at Austin [20]. The absorber and regenerator columns of the\npilot plant are both packed columns with diameters of 0.427m and total packing height of 6.1m. Each\ncolumn consists of two 3.05m packed bed sections with a collector plate and redistributor between the\nbeds.\nOut of the 48 experimental cases carried out in the research program, two cases (Cases 32 and 47) were\nselected for steady state validation purposes. These two cases were selected because of their relatively high\nand low liquid to gas (L\/G) molar flow ratios for the absorber respectively. This further implies relatively\nhigh and low circulation rates of solvent respectively.\nTable 2 shows the process conditions for the lean MEA and flue gas streams to the absorber while Table 3\nshows some absorber column and packing specifications.\nSimulation results were validated using the temperature profile of the absorber column measured in the\npilot plant [20]. In addition the measured CO2 loading of the amine solvent taken at different positions was\ncompared with values obtained from simulation.\nTable 2 Process conditions for Cases 32 and 47\nCase 32 Case47\nStream ID FLUE GAS LEAN MEA\nTO\nABSORBER\nRICH MEA\nFROM\nABSORBER\nFLUE GAS LEAN MEA\nTO\nABSORBER\nRICH MEA\nFROM\nABSORBER\nTemperature (K) 320 314 358 332 313 356\nPressure (105 kPa) 1.035 1.703 1.630 1.033 1.703 0.690\nTotal flow (kg\/s) 0.130 0.720 0.745 0.158 0.642 0.746\nMass Fractions\nH2O 0.0148 0.6334 0.6122 0.0193 0.6334 0.6085\nCO2 0.252 0.0618 0.2901 0.2415 0.0618 0.2943\nMEA 0 0.3048 0.0971 0 0.3048 0.0966\nN2 0.7332 0 0.0006 0.7392 0 0.0006\nL\/G Ratio 6.5 4.6\nTable 3 Equipment Specifications\nDescription Value\nColumn internal diameter (m) 0.427\nHeight of packing (m) 6.1\nNominal packing size (m) 0.0381\nPacking specific area (absorber) (m2\/m3) 145\nPacking Specific area (regenerator) (m2\/m3) 420\nCross Heat Exchanger Heat transfer area (m2) 7\nReboiler volume (m3) 1\nCondenser volume (m3) 2\n4.1 Validation Results of stand-alone columns\nFigures 4 and 5 show the validation results for the stand-alone column based on the temperature profile\nmeasured in the pilot plant for the two selected cases. Feed conditions to the absorber were inputted from\nthe information available in [20] there was limited information available for the feed conditions to the\nregenerator. Therefore, for the stand-alone regenerator, the feed conditions were obtained from the rich\nsolvent conditions estimated by the absorber model.\nIn general, the stand-alone models predict the general shape of the column temperature profiles. The\ndeviations appear higher in the regenerator profile, however, this may be because (as explained earlier) any\ninaccuracies in the absorber model results would be propagated to the regenerator simulation.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 4 (a) Absorber and (b) Regenerator temperature profile of columns for Case 32 (Stand-alone)\n(a) (b)\nFigure 5 (a) Absorber and (b) Regenerator temperature profile for Case 47 (Stand-alone)\nCase 32 Absorber Temperature Profile\n300\n305\n310\n315\n320\n325\n330\n335\n340\n345\n-2 0 2 4 6 8 10\nHeight from bottom of packing (m)\nT\nem\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n(K\n)\nPilot plant\nMeasurements\nRate-based model\nCase 32 Regenerator Temperature Profile\n340\n350\n360\n370\n380\n390\n400\n-2 0 2 4 6 8 10\nHeight from the bottom (m)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n(K\n)\nPilot Plant\nmeasurements\nRate-Based model\nCase 47 Absorber Temperature Profile\n310\n315\n320\n325\n330\n335\n340\n345\n350\n-2 0 2 4 6 8 10\nHeight f rom t he Bot t om ( m)\nPilot Plant\nMeasurements\nRate-based Model\nCase 47 Regenerator Temperature Profile\n340\n345\n350\n355\n360\n365\n370\n-2 0 2 4 6 8 10\nHeight from the bottom (m)\nT\nem\np\ner\nat\nu\nre\n(K\n)\nPilot Plant\nMeasurements\nRate-Based Model\n4.2 Validation Results of integrated model\nFigure 6 shows the validation results for the absorber and regenerator columns when they are linked\ntogether with recycle as shown in Figure 3. The process conditions used are those of Case 32. The results\nshow a different prediction of the temperature profile in the integrated model especially in the regenerator\nbecause of the limitations discussed in Section 4.1. In general, the integrated model gives a better\nprediction of the observed temperature profile. This is expected as the pilot plant consists of columns linked\ntogether with recycle and not stand-alone structure.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 6 (a) Absorber and (b) Regenerator temperature profile of columns for Case 32 (integrated)\n5. Dynamic analysis\nPost-combustion capture offers a wider range of flexibility compared to pre- and oxy-combustion capture\nwith the possibility of turning the regeneration process on, off or reducing the flow of rich solvent to the\nregenerator [21]. Electricity demand levels vary throughout the day. The regeneration process could be\n\u201cturned off\u201d or reduced during peak hours to meet increased demand. It is also likely that as the proportion\nof renewable energy sources increase, CCS plants would be forced to operate flexibly to support the\nintermittency of such renewable sources [21].\nDynamic analysis investigates the behaviour of the integrated system with disturbances from the power\ngeneration process. Three cases were investigated:\na. The effect of increasing flue gas flow to the absorber.\nb. The effect of reducing reboiler heat duty on plant performance.\nc. The effect of increasing CO2 concentration of flue gas to the absorber.\nIt was important to keep control of the water balance in the process because the phenomenon would\nintroduce additional disturbances to the system. Kvamsdal et al explained that if the flue gas stream to the\nabsorber is not saturated with water, there is a tendency that some water would be evaporated in the column\nyielding a saturated stream at the top of the column and concentrating the solvent. This could also occur if\nthe temperature of the flue gas significantly increases as it passes through the column. On the other hand, if\nthe temperature of the flue gas reduces significantly as it passes through the column, some water vapour\nwould condense and thus dilute the solvent [22]. Water balance is therefore a key control issue in the\nprocess.\nCase 32 Regenerator Temperature Profile\n340\n350\n360\n370\n380\n390\n400\n-2 0 2 4 6 8 10\nHeight from the bottom of packing (m)\nT\nem\np\ner\nat\nu\nre\n(K\n)\nPilot Plant Measurements\nRate-Based Integrated\nModel\nRate-Based Stand-alone\nModel\nCase 32 Absorber Temperature Profile\n300\n305\n310\n315\n320\n325\n330\n335\n340\n345\n-2 0 2 4 6 8 10\nHeight from bottom of packing (m)\nT\nem\np\ner\nat\nu\nre\n(K\n) Pilot plant\nMeasurements\nRate-based Integrated\nmodel\nRate-based Stand-\nalone model\nFigure 7 Effects of poor water balance in CO2 absorption process\nFigure 7 above illustrates some of the effects the phenomenon could have. The same conditions for Case 32\nwere maintained for the integrated model as described in Section 4.2. Without any disturbances introduced,\nthe CO2 capture level varies significantly (Figure 7c). As the water mass fraction in the lean solvent\nreduced fairly steadily (Figure 7a), the effect was an initial increase in the CO2 loading of the lean solvent\n(Figure 7b). A maximum loading is reached followed by a subsequent reduction with a resulting increase in\nCO2 capture levels (Figure 7c). This process could lead to severe operational problems especially with\nregards corrosion due to the high concentrations of MEA and CO2 in the solvent.\n5.1 Increasing flue gas flow rate to the absorber\nThis case simulates the effect of an increase in power plant output over a period of 10 minutes. It is\nassumed that this leads to a corresponding increase in flow rate of flue gas to the absorber and its\ncomposition is maintained. The process was simulated with the base-load conditions (Case 32) for two\nhours and a 10% increase in flue gas flow rate was carried out over a period of 10 minutes after which the\nsimulation was left to run for just less than eight hours. In Case 1, the solvent circulation rate was kept\nconstant while in Case 2, the circulation rate was correspondingly increased to maintain the molar L\/G\nratio (Figure 8).\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n0.6\n0.61\n0.62\n0.63\n0.64\n0.65\nTime (hours)\nW\nat\ner\nm\nas\ns\nfr\nac\ntio\nn\n(a)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n0.285\n0.29\n0.295\n0.3\n0.305\nTime (hours)\nLe\nan\nLo\nad\nin\ng\n(m\nol\nC\nO\n2\/\nm\nol\nM\nE\nA\n) (b)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\nTime (hours)\nC\nO\n2\nC\nap\ntu\nre\nLe\nve\nl(\n%\n)\n(c)\nL\nea\nn\nlo\nad\nin\ng\n(m\nol\nC\nO\n2\/m\nol\nM\nE\nA\n)\nC\nO\n2\nca\npt\nur\ne\nle\nve\nl\nFigure 8 Flue gas and Lean MEA flow rate while increasing power plant load\nFigure 9 CO2 capture level with increasing power plant load (Case1 and Case 2)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\n0.2\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nSo\nlv\nen\ntM\nas\nsf\nlo\nw\nra\nte\n(k\ng\/\ns)\nFl\nue\nG\nas\nm\nas\ns\nflo\nw\nra\nte\n(k\ng\/\ns)\nTime (hours)\nFlue Gas\nLean Solvent (Case 1)\nLean Solvent (Case 2)\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nCO\n2\nCa\npt\nur\ne\nLe\nve\nl(\n%\n)\nTime (Hours)\nCase 1\nCase2\nFigure 10 Heat requirement with increasing power plant load (Case1 and Case2)\nFigure 9 shows a decrease in CO2 absorption levels at the onset of the disturbance for Case 1 and virtually\nthe same capture level maintained for Case 2 after a slight drop. This is however at the cost of increased\nheat requirement for capture (Figure 10). The heat required to capture a kg of CO2 in Case 1 drops possibly\nbecause the lean solvent had the capacity to capture more CO2 at the same circulation rate. The heat duty\nrequirement for capture for Case 2 is higher than that of Case 1 but is maintained at almost the same level\nas before the disturbance. The oscillations observed are likely due to controller action.\n5.2 Reducing reboiler heat duty\nThis case investigates the effect of a decrease in reboiler heat duty. This required heat duty for regeneration\nis supplied from the power generation process. Storage of rich amine solvent from the absorber could\nenable this to be done without a drop in CO2 capture rates. This scenario explores the effect of a drop in\nreboiler duty and would not correspond to normal operation in an actual post combustion capture plant.\nBase conditions were maintained for a period of two hours. A 10% reduction in reboiler duty was\nimplemented over ten seconds (Figure 11). Conditions were maintained for just less than eight hours.\n3.84\n3.86\n3.88\n3.9\n3.92\n3.94\n3.96\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nHe\nat\nRe\nqu\nire\nm\nen\ntf\nor\nCa\npt\nur\ne\n(M\nJ\/\nkg\nCO\n2)\nTime (hours)\nCase 1\nCase 2\nFigure 11 Reducing reboiler heat duty\nA significant increase in CO2 loading is observed (Figure 12) resulting from reduced reboiler temperatures.\nThis also had a significant effect on the absorption levels in the absorber column (Figure 13).\nFigure 12 CO2 loading change with reduction in reboiler duty\n96000\n98000\n100000\n102000\n104000\n106000\n108000\n110000\n112000\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nRe\nbo\nile\nrH\nea\ntD\nut\ny\n(W\n)\nTime (hours)\n0.28\n0.285\n0.29\n0.295\n0.3\n0.305\n0.31\n0.315\n0.32\n0.325\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nLe\nan\nSo\nlv\nen\ntC\nO\n2\nLo\nad\nin\ng\n(m\nol\nCO\n2\/\nm\nol\nM\nEA\n)\nTime (hours)\nFigure 13 CO2 capture level with reduction in reboiler duty\nSince the change is carried out over a relatively short period of time, a time constant was estimated. The\ntime constant estimated for the process was 2800s or 46.67 minutes. It should be noted that the lean MEA\nstorage tank in the system would contribute to such a big time constant. Based on the volume of liquid in\nthe tank as well as the flow rate of solvent from the tank, this contribution was estimated as 1388s or 23.14\nminutes. It should be noted that in this model, transport delay has not been accounted for.\n5.3 Increasing CO2 concentration of flue gas to the absorber column\nThis case investigates the effect of increasing CO2 concentration in the flue gas to the absorber. Some\nstudies show that there could be benefits in a combination of two fundamental CO2 capture technologies\n(the partial oxyfuel mode in the furnace and the post-combustion solvent scrubbing) [15]. It is estimated\nthat the enrichment of oxygen content in the combustion air supplied to the furnace from atmospheric 21%\nby volume (or 100% air) to 50% by volume (or 60% air) would result in a new composition of flue gas to\nthe absorber as shown in Table 4. The CO2 mass flow to the absorber was kept constant while the total\nmass flow rate of the flue gas was correspondingly reduced (Figure 14). Figure 15 shows the changes in\ncomponent compositions as this happens. This is done over a period of 30 minutes. Conditions were\nmaintained for about 7.5 hours.\nTable 4 New composition of flue gas with increasing CO2 flue gas concentration\nMass Fractions\n100% air 60% air\nWater 0.0148 0.1014\nCarbon Dioxide 0.2520 0.4885\nNitrogen 0.7332 0.4101\nTotal Mass flow\n(kg\/s)\n0.1200 0.0620\n80\n82\n84\n86\n88\n90\n92\n94\n96\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nCO\n2\nCa\npt\nur\ne\nLe\nve\nl(\n%\n)\nTime (hours)\nFigure 14 Flue gas mass flow rate with increasing CO2 flue gas concentration\nFigure 15 Flue gas composition with increasing CO2 flue gas concentration\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nFl\nue\nga\nsm\nas\nsf\nlo\nw\nra\nte\n(k\ng\/\ns)\nTime (hours)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nCo\nm\npo\nne\nnt\nM\nas\nsf\nra\nct\nio\nn\nTime (hours)\nH2O\nCO2\nN2\n2\nO2\n2\nFigure 16 Effects of increasing CO2 flue gas concentration\nFigure 16a show a significant increase in CO2 capture level after a sharp drop starting from the onset of the\ndisturbance. The initial sharp drop is probably due to the initial increase in absorber temperature observed\nin the column (Figure 17). The solid line in Figure 17 indicates the onset of the disturbance. Afterwards,\nthese temperatures drop sharply and the temperature bulge shifts towards the top of the column (Figure 17).\nThis indicates an offset in water balance in the absorber where more water vapour in the gas stream\ncondenses and dilutes the solvent in the column. Since this water imbalance cannot be remedied by the\ncontrol system employed in the simulation, the dilution cannot be avoided. On dilution, the amount of\nMEA in the rich and subsequently the lean solvent reduces. Since the reboiler is temperature controlled, the\nequilibrium CO2 concentration in the liquid phase reduces and so does the CO2 loading in the lean solvent\n(Figure 16b). Figures 16c and 16d show the reboiler duty and heat requirement for capture respectively\nvariation with the disturbance. The increased absorber temperatures are propagated to the regenerator and\nthus less steam is required in the reboiler. The heat requirement (Figure 16d) for capture also reduces since\nthe same mass flow rate of solvent absorbs significantly more CO2.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n90\n95\n100\nTime (hours)\nC\nap\ntu\nre\nLe\nve\nl(\n%\n)\n(a)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n0.272\n0.273\n0.274\n0.275\n0.276\nTime (hours)\nLe\nan\nS\nol\nve\nnt\nLo\nad\nin\ng\n(b)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n1.08\n1.1\n1.12\n1.14\n1.16\nx 10\n5\nTime (hours)\nR\neb\noi\nle\nr\nD\nut\ny\n(W\n)\n(c)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\n4\nTime (hours)\nH\nea\nt\nR\neq\nui\nre\nm\nen\nt\nM\nJ\/\nkg\nC\n02\n(d)\nFigure 17 Absorber Column Temperature Profile with increasing CO2 flue gas concentration\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a study of CO2 capture using chemical absorption based on the dynamic modelling of\nthe absorber and regenerator columns linked together. Validation results show that the model predicts the\nabsorber and regenerator temperature profiles and CO2 loadings fairly well. It is shown that water balance\nin the absorption process is very important. Dynamic analyses show that the absorber performance is more\nsensitive to the molar L\/G ratio than the actual flow rates of the solvent and flue gas. The performance of\nthe regenerator is affected by the reboiler duty and a time constant for the system was estimated as\n46.67minutes. Some effects of increasing CO2 flue gas concentration observed in the dynamic simulations\nsuch as sharp drops in capture levels and declining performance due to water balance, may not be observed\nwith steady state simulations.\n7.
