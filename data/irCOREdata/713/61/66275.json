Detailed seismic experiments\nat fast- and intermediate-spreading ridges (examples include: Rohr\net al. 1988; Harding et al. 1989, 1993; Detrick et al. 1987, 1993,\n1994; Burnett et al. 1989; Collier & Sinha 1990, 1992a,b; Kent\net al. 1990, 1994, 2000; Toomey et al. 1990; White & Clowes 1990;\nCaress et al. 1992; Carbotte et al. 1997; Christeson et al. 1992, 1996;\nCudrack & Clowes 1993; Toomey et al. 1994; Vera et al. 1990; Vera\n& Diebold 1994; Mutter et al. 1995; Hussenoeder et al. 1996, 2002a;\nGrevemeyer et al. 1997; Hooft et al. 1997; Turner et al. 1999; Dunn\net al. 2000; Day et al. 2001; Tong et al. 2002; Blacic et al. 2004; Sohn\net al. 2004) have revealed the fine-scale structure of the uppermost\ncrust, and low-velocity zones and reflection events associated with\nthe axial magmatic system. Such studies (e.g. Kent et al. 1993a,b,\n2000) have begun to relate structures within the crust to the vari-\nous scales of morphological and petrological segmentation evident\nfrom topographic studies (e.g. Macdonald et al. 1984, 1988) and\nsampling (e.g. Langmuir et al. 1986; Sinton et al. 1991; Auzende\net al. 1996), while others (e.g. Turner et al. 1999; Bazin et al.\n2001; Day et al. 2001; Peirce et al. 2001) have begun to reveal the\nconnectivity of adjacent ridge segments via their melt supply. This\nwork has, therefore, begun to provide important constraints on the\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors 59\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n60 C. Peirce et al.\ndimensions, physical state, along-axis continuity and geometry of\nthe crustal melt reservoir and the development of the internal struc-\nture, seabed morphology and spreading dynamics of the oceanic\ncrust.\nIn contrast, numerous seismic studies undertaken at the slow-\nspreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) have shown little, or no ev-\nidence, for a significant crustal melt body (cf. Calvert 1995 and\nDetrick et al. 1990 and both with Navin et al. 1998) but have\nbegun to reveal the detail of the crustal structure (some exam-\nples include: Detrick et al. 1997; Barclay et al. 1998; Canales &\nDetrick 1998; Smallwood & White 1998; Hussenoeder et al. 2002b;\nDunn et al. 2005). However, the fierce topography associated with\nthe rift valley and the large-scale normal faulting (e.g. Carbotte &\nMacdonald 1990; Shaw & Lin 1993; Escartin & Lin 1995; Escartin\net al. 1999; Reston et al. 2004) prevalent at slow-spreading ridges\nresult in seismic profiles that are contaminated with significant high\namplitude noise\u2014a consequence of scattering from seabed topogra-\nphy both in- and out-of-the-plane of the profile (e.g. Calvert 1997).\nThese steeply dipping, high-amplitude scattered arrivals mask the\nlower amplitude intracrustal reflection events.

In this paper, we present the results of two end-member ap-\nproaches to this problem and their application to a multichannel\nreflection data set acquired at the slow-spreading Reykjanes Ridge.\nBy then combining the seismic results with other geophysical data\nsets we develop an integrated model for axial volcanic ridge for-\nmation and evolution, tectono-magmatic cycles, asymmetric ridge\nspreading and ridge segmentation.\n2 S E T T I N G\nThe Reykjanes Ridge, part of the MAR south of Iceland, is a par-\nticularly good example of a highly segmented, slow-spreading ridge\nsystem (Fig. 1; e.g. Murton & Parson 1993; Parson et al. 1993;\nApplegate & Shor 1994; Searle et al. 1994; Taylor et al. 1995; Sinha\net al. 1997, 1998; Searle et al. 1998; Peirce & Navin 2002; Peirce\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nMorphology and genesis of slow-spreading ridges 61\net al. 2005). The axial seafloor in the study area is dominated by a\nshallow median valley and the presence of a series of well-defined,\nen echelon, axial volcanic ridges.\nThe first RAMESSES project (Reykjanes Axial Melt Experiment:\nStructural Synthesis from Electromagnetics and Seismics; Sinha\net al. 1997, 1998) targeted an axial volcanic ridge (AVR) segment\nat 57\u25e6 45\u2032N. Interpretation of seismic refraction and controlled-\nsource electromagnetic (CSEM) data from the first RAMESSES\ncruise (henceforth RAMESSES I\u2014RRS Charles Darwin CD81\/93\n\u2014Sinha et al. 1994), revealed the presence of a substantial crustal\nmagma chamber beneath this AVR (Navin 1996; Navin et al. 1998;\nMacGregor 1997; MacGregor et al. 1998). Ray trace modelling of\nwide-angle refraction data, interpretation of a reversed polarity re-\nflection event in an along-axis fourfold multichannel seismic (MCS)\nprofile and analysis of CSEM data indicated that the magma cham-\nber comprises a thin, sill-like body containing a high proportion of\nmelt, underlain by a larger volume of \u2018mush\u2019 consisting primarily\nof solid crystals, but with up to 20 per cent partial melt distributed\nthrough it. These features are consistent with a robust axial mag-\nmatic system, similar to that found beneath faster spreading ridges\nand suggest that, in many respects, similar processes occur during\ncrustal accretion at all spreading rates. The combined interpretation\nof high-resolution sonar, gravity, magnetic, CSEM and magnetotel-\nluric (MT) data with the seismic model, provided strong evidence\nthat crustal construction is occurring not as a steady-state process,\nbut in cycles of magmatic accretion followed by tectonic extension\n(Sinha et al. 1997, 1998; Navin et al. 1998; MacGregor et al. 1998;\nHeinson et al. 2000; Peirce & Navin 2002; Peirce et al. 2005), with\nthe duration of such a cycle\u2014a tectono-magmatic cycle\u2014being of\nthe order of 20 000\u201360 000 yr.\nThe objective of the second RAMESSES study (henceforth\nRAMESSES II\u2014RRS Discovery D235c\/98; Peirce & Sinha 1998)\nwas to collect a grid of MCS reflection profiles in order to determine\nthe along-axis variation and geometry of the axial magmatic system\nand to investigate the relationship between magma chamber struc-\nture, the along-axis continuity and segmentation of melt supply to\nthe crust, the development of faulting and the thickness of oceanic\nlayer 2A. In this paper, we present the results of interpreting the grid\nof MCS profiles acquired during RAMESSES II.\n3 A C Q U I S I T I O N\nUsing a 96-channel, 25 m group interval streamer, 32-fold data were\nrecorded while surveying at a speed of 9 km hr\u22121. The seismic source\ncomprised 12 airguns of varying chamber sizes totalling \u223c5175 in3\nvolume (\u223c85 l) which were fired at 2000 psi (13.8 M Pa) pressure\nand with a shot interval of 15 s. Data were recorded at 4 ms sampling\nover a trace length of 10 s.\nA grid of 32 axis-perpendicular and five axis-parallel MCS pro-\nfiles was acquired (Fig. 1), with across-axis profiles spaced at\n\u223c1.5 km intervals and along axis-profiles at 5 km intervals\u2014the\nlatter representing \u223c500 000 yr age intervals at the average half\nspreading rate of 10 mm yr\u22121. With this geometry, 3-D structures\ncould be interpolated between 2-D lines. Two of these profiles, in-\ntersecting at the centre of the AVR, were coincident with the original\nRAMESSES I across-axis (grid line 20) and along-axis (grid line\n37) refraction and fourfold reflection seismic profiles. These profiles\nwere re-shot in order to tie the new MCS images to the constraints\non sub-seafloor structure determined by the previous geophysical\nstudies, as well as to provide well constrained velocity models for\nseismic processing. A number of the across-axis profiles were lo-\ncated north and south of the ends of the RAMESSES I AVR, to in-\nvestigate magma chamber continuity between adjacent AVRs. The\nfour axis-parallel profiles were acquired to investigate how crustal\nstructure varies with age. The overall aim was to construct a detailed\n3-D crustal reflectivity model of the AVR and neighbouring crust to\nthe north and south, extending up to 20 km (2 Myr) off-axis.\n4 S E I S M I C I M A G I N G\nThe 2-D RAMESSES II profiles contain significant seabed scattered\nenergy, both for profiles acquired parallel and perpendicular to the\ntrend of the most significant scattering surfaces\u2014namely the fault\nscarps at the edges of the median valley (Fig. 2). Although a 3-D\ngrid of profiles was acquired, with line spacings adequate to enable\nmapping of reflecting horizons within a 3-D volume, the profiles\nwere not sufficiently closely spaced to allow full 3-D processing. The\n2-D data processing undertaken is briefly outlined below, together\nwith a description of approaches that we adopted to minimize the\nscattered signal.\n4.1 Standard data processing\nNumerous equipment problems were experienced throughout acqui-\nsition which are summarized in Peirce & Sinha (1998). These led to\ndifficulties in geometry assignment, and required the application of\ndetailed source and receiver statics and corrections for source signal\namplitude and dominant frequency variation.\nFor geometry assignment, all source and receiver locations were\ndetermined in x , y, z coordinates (offset in x, y, (m) and depth be-\nlow sea surface (m)) with 0,0,0 being located at the sea surface at\n57\u25e6 45\u2032N 32\u25e6 41\u2032W\u2014the intersection of the original RAMESSES\nI across- and along-axis MCS and wide-angle profiles (and conse-\nquently the intersection of grid lines 20 and 37 of RAMESSES II).\nIndividual source and receiver depths were used to calculate static\ncorrections which were then applied to correct each shot gather to\nthe sea surface datum.\nFollowing sorting to CMP gathers, pre-stack predictive deconvo-\nlution and bandpass filtering (5\u201350 Hz) were applied to reduce inco-\nherent noise and minimize source signature reverberation. The data\nwere then stacked using a normal move-out (NMO) velocity model\nderived from a combination of the RAMESSES I wide-angle ve-\nlocity model, semblance analysis and constant velocity stack (CVS)\npanels. This combined approach to velocity analysis showed that\nintracrustal reflection events are best imaged with CVS sections.\nAlthough a time variable velocity model was produced for final\nsection generation, migration and depth conversion, most sections\nshown in this paper are plotted as CVSs, with stacking velocities tai-\nlored to highlight specific reflecting horizons.

The velocities were chosen from the above, to best high-\nlight specific intracrustal events or to provide an overall image of\nthe entire section. In some cases this was followed by migration.\nAlthough this simple, standard approach to data processing was\nfound to give the best results for the majority of profiles, it had a lim-\nited effect on the seabed scattered signal. Frequency-wave number\n(FK) dip move-out (DMO) and FK migration (pre- and post-stack)\nwere also tested as a means of reducing this signal (Kent et al. 1996),\nand as a means of correctly positioning the seafloor and minimizing\nthe distortion resulting from NMO-based constant velocity stacking\nas described below.\n4.2 Dipping reflecting horizons\nThe standard approach to MCS data processing is founded on the\nassumption of planar and horizontal reflectors. In many cases this\nassumption is also valid where reflector dip is shallow and occurs\nover a distance longer than the acquisition foot print at each reflect-\ning horizon.\nHowever, at mid-ocean ridges this basic assumption clearly breaks\ndown. The common depth reflecting point is significantly laterally\nsmeared and the sections are distorted both laterally and vertically.\nIn cases of significant reflector variability, full 3-D acquisition and\nprocessing should ideally be applied, with processing based upon\nalgorithms designed to accommodate steep dips. Such a fully 3-D\ndata set was acquired by Kent et al. (2000) at the EPR, where the\nseabed is significantly smoother due to the faster spreading rate.\nHowever, even application of fully 3-D processing to that data set\nwas unable to fully suppress or correctly migrate the entire seabed-\nscattered wavefield. For the 2-D RAMESSES II MCS data, both\nFK DMO and FK migration were applied to minimize the effect\nof dip and seabed scattering. Although these processes provided\nsome improvement in section clarity for the along-axis profile, the\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nMorphology and genesis of slow-spreading ridges 63\nimprovement proved minimal for the across-axis profiles with, in\ngeneral, much of the seabed scattered energy merely being smeared.\nThis is largely because these methods of 2-D processing are unable\nto deal with out-of-plane scattered energy. Examples of the results\nof the standard and dipping approaches to processing are shown\nthroughout this paper.\n4.3 Simulating seafloor scattering\nAs Fig. 2 shows, all of the profiles are dominated by noise asso-\nciated with scattering of the down-going wavefield by the rough\nmedian valley and AVR seabed topography. It is often argued that\nintracrustal events seen on MCS profiles at mid-ocean ridge axes\nmay merely be scattered events. It is, therefore, vital to suppress this\nscatter, or at the very least be able to distinguish it from any real\nevents that it may obscure, before any form of interpretation can\ntake place.\nTwo end-member approaches were adopted. The first aims to\nsynthetically recreate the seafloor-scattered signal, so that it can\nbe compared directly with the real data, and the identified scatter\nevents preferentially muted (suppressed) during the early stages of\nprocessing prior to stacking. The second aims solely to syntheti-\ncally recreate the scatter signal for direct comparison with observed\nstacked data sections only.\nThe former modelling of the seabed in three dimensions requires\na full wavefield approach. To enable direct comparison of synthetic\nmodel results with observed data also requires replication of the pre-\nstack (i.e. multireceiver) amplitudes as well as traveltimes. The latter\napproach can be far more simplistic since its goal is only to identify\nevents most likely to be of a scattered origin such that they can be\nignored during interpretation. Both end-member approaches to the\nscatter simulation require the seabed topography to be known with\na resolution better than the Fresnel zone width at the seabed corre-\nsponding to the seismic data characteristics. The highest resolution\nswath bathymetry data available have been compiled by Keeton et al.\n(1997) and this was used for all modelling.\n4.3.1 Phase screen modelling\nComputing pre-stack synthetic data from a 3-D representation of the\nseafloor for each of the 37 profiles using a standard finite difference\napproach would be prohibitively computationally expensive, taking\nperhaps several years to compute a synthetic version of just one of the\nprofiles being analysed. The phase screen method (Wild & Hudson\n1998; Wild et al. 2000; Hobbs et al. 2003) provides an alternative\nwhich is considerably faster, although it does have certain inherent\nlimitations.\nWild & Hudson (1998) summarize the approach as amounting\n\u2018to a reduction of the heterogeneous model medium. . . . . . ..to a\nsequence of diffracting screens, orientated perpendicular to the pre-\ndominant direction of wave propagation\u2019. During propagation be-\ntween screens, the parameters of the medium are assumed to be\nconstant for any wave entering from the same point on the screen,\nwith the values set to that at the entry point. Therefore, the phase\nscreen code is particularly appropriate for computing the response\nof the seafloor since the model comprises a uniform medium (the\nwater column) with a single interface (the seabed).\nTo replicate the seabed scattering in this study, only P-waves\nwere considered. One of the advantages of this method is that the\nindividual screens need not be equally spaced. The screen spacing\nin the water column can be much greater than that in the region\nof the seafloor so that computation time is not spent unnecessarily\ncalculating the seismic response of sea water. An example of the\nparametrization approach is shown in Fig. 3.\nBefore commencing with parametrization, the resolution of the\nswath bathymetry data must be considered in the context of the Fres-\nnel zone width at the seabed. Keeton et al.\u2019s (1997) bathymetric com-\npilation has a horizontal resolution of 200 \u00d7 200 m. For the average\nwater column velocity, dominant source frequency band and average\ndepth to the seabed, the diameter of the Fresnel zone is approximately\n200 m for reflections from a horizontal seafloor. However, sidescan\nsonar images show that significant variation in seabed topography\noccurs vertically and laterally on wavelengths shorter than this. The\neffect this has on the calculation of the scattering is that, although\nthe small-scale features lead to short wavelength variations in the\namplitude of the primary arrivals, they do not significantly affect the\ntraveltimes nor do they generate the larger-scale scattering events\nidentified throughout the data sections. Therefore, Keeton et al.\u2019s\n(1997) swath bathymetry data compilation was considered suffi-\nciently accurate to undertake the scatter forward modelling using\nthe phase screen method.\nThe objective of the phase screen modelling is to predict and\nidentify scatter to a two-way traveltime (TWTT) just above the first\nsea surface multiple, thus minimizing computation time (since the\nmultiple largely obscures all other coherent reflection events). Ide-\nally, it should be possible to subtract the synthetic events from the\nreal data. However, this would require exact phase and amplitude\nmatching and the application of accurate statics to the real pre-stack\ndata to ensure a consistent datum. An alternative approach is to pick\nthe TWTT of arrivals common to both the real and synthetic gathers\nat the pre-stack stage, and construct surgical mutes to remove the\nscattered energy from the real data. The cleaned gathers are then\nprocessed as outlined above. It is important to note that both in-\nand out-of-plane scattered arrivals are simulated and (in principle)\nsuppressed by this approach.\nThe first stage of muting the seafloor scattered energy is to com-\npute synthetic shot gathers for an entire MCS line. The main re-\nquirements (Fig. 3) are a velocity model; the seafloor topography\nalong the profile and out-of-the-plane to two streamer lengths (5 km)\neither side; the acquisition geometry; and the frequency content of\nthe seismic source. Each synthetic gather takes \u223c1 hr of CPU time\non a six-processor machine to compute and, hence, an entire profile\nof gathers takes \u223c6 weeks. However, although the synthetic gather\nspacing needs to be small so that arrivals from common features\ncan be tracked between them, the horizontal resolution of the swath\nbathymetry data defining the model seafloor is only 200 \u00d7 200 m.\nTherefore, as it is expected that shots with a smaller spacing than\n200 m would show little variation, the synthetic shot spacing was\nset at 112.5 m, the equivalent of modelling every third shot, which\nreduced computation time significantly.\nHaving calculated the synthetic gathers, these are compared with\nthe real data gathers on a shot-by-shot basis (Fig. 4) and common ar-\nrivals are picked. A ramped trapezium surgical mute is then defined\nand applied on a trace-by-trace basis at the gather level for each\ncommon arrival (Fig. 5). A similar muting process, this time done\non a channel-by-channel basis between gathers, is also applied to the\nseabed primary reflection, since the TWTT of this event is perturbed\nsignificantly on the far-offset channels by the rough seafloor. The\ndata are then processed to stacked section as described above. Fig. 5\nshows example scattered arrival picks and the mute definition.\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of the muting process, Fig. 6 shows a\ncomparison of constant velocity stacks made using pre-stack muted\ndata and the equivalent un-muted data. In this figure it can be seen\nthat the muting has removed much of the scattered energy. Since\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n64 C.

An alternative, opposite end-member approximation\napproach was, therefore, developed as a complimentary analysis\ntool, and is outlined in the next section.\n4.3.2 \u2018Quick and simple\u2019 method\nAn alternative strategy for dealing with the seafloor scattering prob-\nlem is to adopt an approach that is purely predictive at the final\nstacked section level, and which uses the synthetic results purely\nas an identification tool rather than a means by which to remove or\nsubdue unwanted arrivals. Ground-truthing against the phase screen\nresults has allowed us to apply this approach widely and with confi-\ndence throughout the data set. Another advantage is that the \u2018quick\nand simple\u2019 method can predict diffraction tails to longer TWTTs\nthan can readily be calculated by the phase screen approach.\nThe method is outlined below. It is based on a simplification to\nKirchoff-Helmholz theory (e.g. Hilterman 1970; Trorey 1970) and\nassumes coincident sources and receivers to simulate stacked MCS\nsections as outlined in, for example, Cao & Kennett (1989).\nInitially, the entire bathymetry data set is gridded at a node\ninterval matching the common mid-point (CMP) spacing, whilst\navoiding spatial aliasing\u2014in this case 25 m. For each CMP po-\nsition along a profile, a region 2.5 times the streamer length in\nall directions (6700 m) is selected. The traveltime to each bathy-\nmetric cell (assuming coincident source and receiver) within this\n144 km2 region is calculated assuming direct water waves and a\nconstant sea water velocity (1480 m s\u22121). The azimuth, angle of\nincidence at, and reflection coefficient across the seabed are also\ncalculated and any ray paths incident at greater than 45\u25e6 rejected.\nAll traveltime estimates are then used to synthetically create an ef-\nfective reflectivity function by applying a spherical divergence cor-\nrection to the signal amplitudes and summing the contributions in\n4 ms (the sampling interval) time bins progressively beneath each\nCMP position. As this method approximates data acquisition with\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nMorphology and genesis of slow-spreading ridges 65\n2\n3\n4\nT\nW\nT\nT\n\/s\n0 20 40 60 80\nchannel [25m]\nA\n2\n3\n4\n0 20 40 60 80\nchannel [25m]\nB\nFigure 4.

Direct comparison of shot gathers allows scattered parts of the wavefield\nto be distinguished from sub-seabed reflections.\ncoincident source and receiver, it generates a simple CMP stack\nrepresentation where the stacking velocity is effectively 1480 m s\u22121.\nAn example of the effective reflectivity is shown, and can be com-\npared directly with the corresponding real CVS data, in Fig. 2. This\napproach takes only \u223c20 s of CPU time per CMP on a single pro-\ncessor machine and, although \u2018quick and simple\u2019, does allow direct\ncomparison with the real data to the extent of being able to identify\nthe events most likely to have a scattered origin in the stacked sec-\ntions. Fig. 2 shows synthetic seismograms calculated using this ap-\nproach by convolving the effective reflectivity with a representative\nwavelet.\n4.4 Approach to interpretation\nInitially, each profile was scrutinized to identify events most likely\noriginating from scatter at the seabed using the \u2018quick and simple\u2019\napproach. This was then ground-truthed against the phase screen\nresults especially at shallow, sub-seabed depths where the scatter-\ning is most significant. For grid line 20 (across-axis) and grid line\n37 (along-axis), a direct comparison was also made between events\ndetermined by this process to be of intracrustal origin and those pre-\ndicted from the wide-angle models of Navin et al. (1998) (e.g. the\noceanic layer 2A\/B and 2\/3 boundaries and the Moho) or imaged\nwithin the RAMESSES I MCS data (e.g. Figs 7\u201310). This enabled\nus to determine the most likely origin of each set of reflection events.\nIt also allowed us to determine specific characteristics which could\nthen be used to identify the various reflectors, and applied to all\nprofiles propagating out from the intersection points of grid lines 20\nand 37. Further forward modelling, including sub-seafloor velocity\nstructures, of pre-stack gathers was then undertaken (e.g. Figs 11\nand 12) to confirm (or otherwise) the interpretation of each event,\nand as a means of ensuring interpretation consistency throughout\nall profiles.\nHaving identified the most likely origin of each observed in-\ntracrustal event, every profile was then interpreted using a com-\nbination of sections processed with both standard and dipping ap-\nproaches and using variable and constant velocity models for move-\nout correction, migration and depth conversion, tailored to suit par-\nticular target horizons. Our definition of the various classes of events,\ntheir characteristics and examples of their interpretation on sections\nare described in the next section.\n5 R E F L E C T I O N E V E N T S\nA N D T H E I R O R I G I N S\nHaving identified or suppressed as much of the seabed scattered\nnoise as possible, the 37 final processed sections were interpreted as\ndescribed above and in the context of their geological setting. The\ninterpretation focuses on five main types of intracrustal events as\noutlined below. An across-axis profile (grid line 30; Fig. 7) and an\nalong-axis profile (grid line 37; Fig. 9) have been selected to show\nthe main features which are identifiable throughout the data set.\nGrid line 37 is coincident with the RAMESSES wide-angle model\nof Navin et al. (1998), and this provides a good velocity control\nwith which to depth convert event TWTT picks. In Figs 7 and 9\nidentifiable events have been grouped and colour-coded to reflect\ntheir interpretation. Events with the same colour code are interpreted\nto be arrivals from the same, or closely related, horizons. In all cases\nthese can be mapped on adjacent and intersecting profiles, giving\nconfidence that they are real events.\n5.1 Shallow crustal event\u2014base of layer 2A (blue)\nThis event is imaged throughout the majority of the survey area at\n\u223c0.3 s TWTT below the seabed. Inspection of CMP gathers (Fig. 11)\nshows that this arrival is only imaged on the far offset traces, where\nthe source-receiver offset is greater than 2.1 km. Its presence on\nonly these traces indicates that this event is not a simple reflection\nfrom a sharp intracrustal interface. However, the maximum source\u2013\nreceiver offset for this survey is \u223c2.6 km and, hence, this event is\nwell sampled on multiple traces.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n66 C. Peirce et al.\nFigure 5. Scatter muting process applied to a single shot gather from line 30. Stage 1: TWTT picks (black stars in 1a) defining each identified scattered event\nare interpolated between traces within the shot gather (1b), and then interpolated for each common channel between shot gathers. Stage 2: The shape (2a)\nand position (2b) of the mute window are defined around each of the picks. Stage 3: The mute window defined in stage 2 (3a) is applied to the gather (3b) to\nsuppress the scattered signal.\nTo ascertain its origin, 1-D forward modelling was carried out\nusing the crfl reflectivity code (Fuchs & Mu\u00a8ller 1971). Two best-\nfitting final models are shown in Figs 12(a) and (c), along with\nthe Navin et al. (1998) on-axis wide-angle velocity model for the\nRAMESSES AVR and the Harding et al. (1993) on-axis velocity\nmodel for the EPR for reference. The main difference between these\ntwo models is the fine structure of layer 2A, which in one is a single\nlayer of constant velocity gradient, while in the other is divided\ninto two layers of differing velocity gradient. Comparison of the\ncalculated synthetic gathers (Figs 12b and d) with the real gathers\n(Fig. 11) shows that the latter provides the better amplitude fit, when\nconsidering the relative amplitude between the seabed reflection\nand the \u2018far-offset\u2019 event. Comparing this with the interpretation of\nHarding et al. (1993) suggests that the shallow crustal event imaged\nin the RAMESSES data is from the base of layer 2A. We refer to this\narrival as an event rather than a reflection since its most likely origin,\nwhich the modelling supports, is energy that has turned or partially\nturned in a steep velocity gradient prior to reflection. Of the two\nmodels presented here the model shown in Fig. 12(a) is favoured.\nThis model is more detailed than the upper crustal section of the\nwide-angle model of Navin et al. (1998), which is to be expected as,\nin the latter, any upper crustal arrivals are largely obscured at near\noffset by the large amplitude direct water wave.\nWhen a variable stacking velocity function is used for NMO with\nan event of this type, the far offset traces are badly affected by NMO\nstretch and are, therefore, muted during normal processing.

As a result it is best imaged within\nCVS sections, in which neither severe NMO stretch nor consequent\nmuting occur. As the layer 2A event is only evident on the longer\noffset traces, only traces with source-receiver offsets of 0\u2013500 m (to\nshow the seabed) and 2000\u20133000 m (to show the layer 2A event)\nwere included during CVS processing to create the sections which\nwere then used to map this event across the survey area. Three\nexamples of the layer 2A event on such sections are shown in Fig. 13.\nThe layer 2A event is prevalent throughout the study area. Its\namplitude varies significantly, and this is attributed to seafloor scat-\ntering effects. Off-axis it appears at between 0.1 and 0.5 s TWTT\nbelow the seabed. On-axis this interval increases to a maximum be-\nneath the shallowest AVR topography, suggesting that layer 2A is\nthickest at this location (Fig. 14). The along-axis thickness variation\nof this layer at zero age persists off-axis. The layer 2A event is also\nobserved to be offset by inward-facing normal faults (Fig. 13d).\nThe velocity function derived from the 1-D modelling was used to\nconvert TWTT picks of this event into depth, although with caution\nsince this event is not a true reflection. Under this assumption any\nvariation in TWTT reflects a change in layer 2A thickness. Fig. 14\nshows the inferred depth to the layer 2A\/2B boundary along three\nprofiles\u2014two running across-axis (grid lines 24 and 34) and one\nalong-axis (grid line 37). The depth to the base of layer 2A below\nthe seabed is seen to vary between \u223c130 and 200 m. On grid line\n37, layer 2A is thickest beneath the AVR\u2019s shallowest bathymetric\npoint, and thins both north and south towards AVR tips.\nIn previous studies, the layer2A\/2B transition has been variously\nimaged using a variety of seismic methods and offsets (Harding et al.\n1989; Vera et al. 1990; Vera & Diebold 1994; Minshull et al. 1991;\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n68 C.

The RAMESSES 1 CSEM\nmodelling results (MacGregor et al. 1998; and see Fig. 12) show\nthat the seismic layer 2A\/2B transition corresponds with a rapid\ndecrease in porosity. The similarity of the RAMESESS results with\nthose from the EPR and from the drilled section of layer 2 in ODP\nHole 504b (Collins et al. 1998) and the Hess Deep (Francheteau\net al. 1992), all of which equate the layer 2A event with the base\nof the extrusive igneous section, suggest that the observations from\nthe RAMESSES area have a similar origin.\nSmallwood & White (1998) analysed MCS data further north on\nthe Reykjanes Ridge between 61\u25e6 and 62\u25e6N. They too interpreted\nthe layer 2A event as the base of the extrusive layer and found that\nits average thickness is 400 \u00b1 100 m. Using the assumption that the\nextrusive layer corresponds to the magnetic source layer, they were\nable to model the sea surface magnetic field. Peirce et al. (2005)\nand Gardiner (2003) show that in the RAMESSES area, the mag-\nnetic anomaly and magnetization intensity variation correlate with\ninferred sites of recent magmatic influx to the crustal magmatic sys-\ntem, and hence regions of likely recent extrusion. Their magnetic\nintensity solution (Fig. 15) shows that although the longer wave-\nlength trend follows the ridge trend, the shorter wavelength anoma-\nlies are associated with AVRs that represent regions of apparently\nthicker layer 2A. All of these observations support the hypothe-\nsis that the layer 2A event represents the base of the extrusive layer,\nand that this also correlates with the base of the strongly magnetized\nlayer.\nFig. 15 shows both AVR- and ridge-parallel trends in the thickness\nof layer 2A. The ridge-parallel trend is more pronounced outside the\nmedian valley, while the AVR-trend is more pronounced within. The\nvertical displacement of the layer 2A event across faults (Fig. 13)\nindicates that this layer pre-dates the faulting and originated on or\nclose to the axis. The variation in layer 2A thickness also mirrors\nthe location of relict AVRs observed in the bathymetry data. Extinct\nAVRs show up both as topographic highs in the bathymetry, and as\nsites of thickened layer 2A (red shades in Fig. 15d). These features\nare being rafted off-axis, and displaced vertically by normal faults\nas, overtime, they are carried up the median valley walls.\n5.2 Upper crustal reflector beneath the AVR (purple)\nThe profile along the AVR axis (grid line 37; Fig. 9) shows an upper\ncrustal event (purple) beneath layer 2A that is not observed on any\nof the across-axis profiles. The absence of this arrival on the across-\naxis lines is most likely attributable to imaging problems caused\nby the steeply dipping topography, which causes de-focusing of en-\nergy emerging from the crust. The purple event is not imaged on any\nother axis-parallel profile or indeed anywhere off-axis, suggesting\nthat it is related to a feature of the very young oceanic crust.

Final TWTT sections for line 37\u2014along-axis. (a) Interpretation derived from all TWTT-based versions of this profile. The reflection events in the\ncurrent MCS data set have been colour-coded (blue, red, purple and yellow) according to their identification\u2014see text for details. The stars and diamonds show\nTWTTs to high amplitude scattered arrivals identified on the synthetics for the intersecting across-axis MCS lines. The stars indicate energy originating from a\npoint to the east of this MCS line, while the diamonds indicate energy originating from the west. There is a good agreement between the TWTT of this scattered\nenergy and the arrival highlighted in yellow. This section has been constant-velocity migrated at 1480 m s\u22121.

(c) Variable velocity, pre-stack FK DMO, muted using the phase screen approach to remove seabed\nscattered signal. Intersection points with across-axis profiles are shown by the red vertical dashed lines. All horizons interpreted as real intracrustal events in\n(a) are also present in this section. However, the maximum modelled traveltime of the phase screen synthetics is shallower than the yellow event of (a), which\nis interpreted to be seafloor scattered energy. (d) Scattered wavefield predicted by the \u2018quick and simple\u2019 approach. This section corresponds to a 1480 m s\u22121\nCVS, so scattered events are not directly comparable to the yellow events on the migrated section (a).\nthe phase screen modelling confirms that this event has an on-axis\nintracrustal origin.\nTo investigate this feature, its depth below seabed was calculated\nfrom traveltime picks. The velocity model shown in Fig. 12 was\nused as a starting point. The velocity at the purple event was taken\nto be 4.5 km s\u22121 on this basis, in conjunction with Navin et al.\u2019s\n(1998) wide-angle velocity model.\nIn DSDP\/ODP Hole 504B, the sheeted dyke complex is sepa-\nrated from the extrusive volcanic layer by a transition zone \u223c200 m\nthick and composed of both volcanics and sheeted dykes (Collins\net al. 1998). Similarly at the Hess Deep, a transition zone ranging\nfrom 50 to 200 m in thickness has been observed in four locations\n(Francheteau et al. 1992). A change in porosity is reported at the\nbase of the transition zone at Hole 504B. It is feasible that the pur-\nple event corresponds to this change in porosity at the base of a\ntransition zone between predominantly extrusive volcanics and pre-\ndominately intrusive dyke morphologies beneath the AVR (cf. Hooft\net al. 1996; Becker et al. 1989; Wilcock et al. 1992). This would\nbe consistent with the results of Greer et al. (2002), who showed\nthat axial crustal porosity at the RAMESSES site decreases from\n\u223c25 per cent in layer 2A to only \u223c7 per cent at 1 km depth; and that\nporosity at the same depth decreases significantly off-axis, which is\nmost likely the result of hydrothermal sealing, over time, of a por-\ntion of the porosity (e.g. Anderson et al. 1982). This might explain\nthe absence of a sharp reflecting boundary at this depth away from\nthe axis.\nFig. 14(d) shows the axial upper crustal structure for grid line\n37 based on this interpretation. The structure is composed of three\nlayers. The base of the \u2018layer 2a (volcanics)\u2019 unit corresponds to the\nblue event observed on all profiles. The base of the layer marked\n\u2018transition zone (volcanic and dykes)\u2019 corresponds to the purple\nevent observed only on the along-axis profile. Note that the purple\nhorizon is coincident in depth with the base of layer 2A beneath the\nshallowest AVR topography, where layer 2A is seen to be thickest.\n5.3 Mid-crustal reflectors beneath the median\nvalley\u2014axial magmatic system (red)\nIn Fig. 16 a group of mid-crustal reflectors can be seen beneath\nthe ridge axis (cf. Fig. 9). Comparison with Navin et al.\u2019s (1998)\nwide-angle seismic velocity model indicates that these features cor-\nrespond to the top of the axial melt lens. Fig. 15(b) shows the TWTT\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nMorphology and genesis of slow-spreading ridges 71\n2\n4\n2\n3\n4\nT\nW\nT\nT\n\/s\nD\nscatter prediction\n2\n4\n2\n3\n4\nT\nW\nT\nT\n\/s\n20 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\nvariable velocity stack; muted\nC\nFigure 9. (Continued.)\npicks of these events. In common with the base of layer 2A, they\nare generally deepest beneath the regions of shallowest AVR topog-\nraphy.\nSimilar arrivals are also observed beneath the offset basins that\nseparate adjacent AVRs (cf. Fig. 7). Both groups of events share a\nsimilar TWTT below the seabed and seismic characteristics. The\nTWTTs of the events beneath the offset basins match well to the\ndepth of the off-axis layer 2\/3 transition (although no wide-angle\nrefraction or reflection profile from RAMESSES I crosses either off-\nset basin within the RAMESSES study area). The reflectors beneath\nthe offset basins are geometrically distinct from reflectors associ-\nated with faulting at the median valley walls (see next section), but\nin many cases a weak reflector can be traced linking these events\nto the axial magma chamber reflector (Fig. 16). We interpret the\nmid-crustal reflections beneath the offset basins to the south\u2013west\nand north\u2013east of the original RAMESSES 1 AVR as being from the\ntop of crustal melt accumulations. In other words, an axial magma\nchamber (AMC) reflector is present not only beneath the AVRs,\nbut also beneath the two deep non-transform offset basins between\nAVRs covered by our survey.\n5.4 Fault related reflectors beneath the median\nvalley walls (green)\nFig. 17 shows examples of mid-crustal reflection events observed\nbeneath the western median valley wall on across-axis profiles. Sim-\nilar events are seen beneath the eastern wall. They are also imaged\non the axis-parallel profiles, where they have smaller amplitude.\nThese reflections do not have the same sub-seabed TWTT as any\nothers imaged by the seismic data.\nThe green reflectors are observed to dip towards the ridge axis. To\nascertain the true dip, profiles were migrated (Fig. 17e) and depth\nconverted (Fig. 17f) using a velocity model (Fig. 18a) derived from\n2-D finite difference forward modelling (Fig. 18b). The best-fitting\nmodel shows that the events are the result of multiple reflectors\nthat appear to be located beneath the major inward-facing normal\nfault scarps that offset the seabed. The diffraction hyperbolae seen\nat the edges of the synthetic reflectors are not observed in the real\ndata, which suggests that in reality these features do not terminate\nabruptly. For the example shown in Fig. 18, the three discontinuities\ndip at between 17\u25e6 and 39\u25e6, with each being of the order of \u223c500 m\nin length. The association of these reflectors with the seabed expres-\nsion of faulting implies a link between the two. Several possibilities\nexist. The events may represent pre-existing surfaces rotated by sub-\nsequent faulting (Fig. 19), or they may themselves represent fault\nplanes (Fig. 20).\nFig. 19 illustrates how the orientation of two pre-existing dis-\ncontinuities, or layer boundaries, might be affected by normal fault\nmotion. It is clear that an originally horizontal discontinuity would\nnot fit our observations. However, an originally steeply dipping dis-\ncontinuity (e.g. an old fault surface) would rotate and dip towards\nthe median valley. Observed event dips decrease towards the ridge\naxis, which would suggest that inner fault blocks may rotate more\nthan older, outer fault blocks. The logical conclusion of this ar-\ngument is that the interpreted fault-associated discontinuities are\ncaused by a single, or system, of discontinuities that pre-dated all\nfaulting activity as evidenced by fault scarps at the seabed.\nAnalysis of earthquakes originating along the Reykjanes Ridge\n(Fig. 21) shows focal mechanisms to have a strong normal compo-\nnent with nodal plane dips within the range 35\u25e6\u201355\u25e6. Only hypocen-\ntres shallower than 7 km below the seabed are observed. This is\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n72 C.

In (c) a variable stacking velocity has been applied, selected to image the seabed, the shallow crust arrival and\nany deeper events. The variable NMO velocity function is shown in (d). The shallow crustal arrival in (c) is weaker than in (b) due to the greater NMO stretch\nassociated with the variable velocity stacking. The dashed line in (c) shows the mute that would normally be applied in order to remove any sampled points that\nhad been stretched by more than 30 per cent. (e) Shallow crustal event imaged within a CDP super-gather from line 37 (along-axis profile on zero-age crust).\nThis has been NMO corrected with a velocity of 1700 m s\u22121. This event has the same AVO characteristics as that shown in (a\u2013c), which suggests it is generated\nfrom a horizon whose characteristics do not change significantly with age.\nconsistent with observations elsewhere on the MAR (e.g. Kong et al.\n1992; Barclay et al. 2001) and suggests that the brittle-ductile tran-\nsition lies at around this depth at the ridge-axis.\nWe have developed three models to test possible origins for the\ngreen events. Fig. 20 shows these models, all of which are based\non the assumption that off-axis earthquake activity and fault sys-\ntems result from normal faulting associated with extension along\nthe spreading direction.\nIn Fig. 20 model A, the events originate directly from large offset,\nlistric, block-rotating fault planes\u2014which are imaged only at depth.\nWe assume that no reflections are seen from shallower parts of the\nfaults because the dip of the fault surface is too great. This model\nsuffers from two major disadvantages. First, to match the geometry\nof the reflecting horizons the dip of the fault planes must be \u223c80\u25e6\nimmediately below the seabed. Secondly, in this model no faults\npropagate to depths greater than 2 km below the seabed. Both of\nthese are incompatible with the earthquake data from the region.\nIn model B, the scarps at the seabed again correspond to major\ninward-facing normal faults that become listric at depth, but in this\ncase the reflectors are associated with the listric part of a fault plane\nwhich crops out at an adjacent escarpment. Although the fault plane\ndips do not exceed 55\u25e6, this model suffers the same disadvantage in\nthat the fault planes do not propagate more than 2 km beneath the\nseabed.\nIt is possible that the depth of the brittle-ductile transition beneath\nthe median valley flanks varies through time, with the stages of the\ntectono-magmatic cycle. In that case, the green reflectors may cor-\nrespond to listric faults that during the current, relatively magmatic\nstage of the cycle sole out at a depth similar to the top of the axial\ncrustal magma body. This does not preclude the possibility of the\nmajor faults extending to substantially greater depths, as indicated\nby the earthquake data, along parts of the ridge that are currently at\na tectonically dominated phase of the cycle.\nIn the final model, C, the reflection events are not directly related\nto the large offset faults, but instead originate from low-dip portions\nof synthetic faults associated with the major fault systems. The\nsynthetic faults may result from unloading and internal deformation\nof the footwall block due to fault motion associated with on-going\nextension. This model is supported by the observation of smaller\nseabed offsets further off-axis from the major seabed fault scarps.\nTo test model C, a finite difference model was created which rep-\nresents the fault geometry as a set of discontinuities. The synthetic\nprofile is shown in Fig. 20(e). Although this profile contains many\narrivals which can be attributed to seafloor scatter (cf. Figs 2, 7 and\n8), events matching the observed reflectors\u2014including the absence\nof diffraction hyperbolae\u2014are clearly seen.\nWe conclude that the green reflectors are directly related to ma-\njor normal fault systems that form the walls of the median valley;\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n74 C.

Both compare\nfavourably with the real data shown in Fig. 11. The preferred model (a) is in good agreement with the results of Harding et al. (1993) and also fits the sub-seabed\nvelocity derived from the wide-angle velocity model of Navin et al. (1998)\u2014confirming that the shallow crustal event (blue) is equivalent to the seismic layer\n2A event imaged in many other similar surveys. See text for details. Note that the maximum source-receiver offset for this survey is \u223c2.6 km, and that the layer\n2A event appears on the far-offset traces only.\nand that only the sections of the faults with shallower dips are im-\naged. However we cannot resolve from our data whether these major\nbounding faults are listric, soling out at a depth of \u223c2 km; or are\nplanar faults extending deeper into the crust, but accompanied by\nsmaller listric synthetic faults related to internal deformation of the\nfootwall blocks.\n5.5 Lower-crustal reflectivity beneath\nthe ridge-axis (yellow)\nFig. 9 shows a series of deeper reflection events at \u223c4 s TWTT,\nobserved only on the profile along the AVR axis (grid line 37). This\n\u2018intracrustal\u2019 event is at a similar TWTT to a series of events ob-\nserved on the original fourfold MCS data which were interpreted as\npeg-leg multiples from the AMC by Navin et al. (1998). That inter-\npretation was considered the most likely origin at the time, in the\nabsence of multiple intersecting across-axis profiles, and was based\non conversion of their along-axis wide-angle velocity-depth model\nto TWTT for direct comparison with the coincident RAMESSES I\nMCS data. However comparison with the results of scatter simula-\ntion using the \u2018quick and simple\u2019 approach (Fig. 9), shows that this\nevent may instead be scattered energy from the seabed. We conclude\nthat it is more likely that neither the yellow event in this study, nor\nthe peg-leg multiple reported by Navin et al. (1998), correspond to\nreal intracrustal reflections.\n5.6 Summary\nFour types of reflection events have been consistently imaged\nthroughout the survey area.

The layer 2A event, highlighted by red arrows, can be traced as a coherent event on multiple intersecting profiles. (d) Normal fault cutting\nthe layer 2A event (blue highlighting). The profile has been FK migrated at water column velocity (1480 m s\u22121) and a seabed mute applied. This shows that\nfaulting post-dates layer 2A creation. The approximate location of the fault is indicated by the green dashed line. The event indicated by the red arrow is a\nmigration artefact and does not relate to any geological feature.\nAlthough not imaged as a primary reflection, it is observed on all\nprofiles and can be mapped consistently throughout the entire sur-\nvey area, using the preferred variable velocity model (Fig. 12a) to\nconvert TWTT into depth. The base of layer 2A lies between \u223c130\nand 520 m below seafloor (bsf), and is found to be deepest beneath\nthe shallowest bathymetric point of each AVR. The base of the layer\nis offset by the numerous ridge-parallel faults that form the median\nvalley walls.\n(2) Beneath the AVR a horizon is imaged up to \u223c1000 m below\nthe base of layer 2A. At its shallowest, which is also the shallowest\ntopographic point on the AVR, it is almost coincident with the base\nof layer 2A where the latter is thickest. This horizon is interpreted as\nthe base of a transition zone comprising mixed volcanic extrusives\nand sheeted dykes. The thinnest part of this layer is interpreted to\nreflect the region of most recent melt flux to the seabed, building\nthe highest peak in the AVR topography. It is only seen in close\nproximity to, or directly beneath, an AVR and has not been observed\noff axis.\n(3) Within the median valley two sets of melt event are im-\naged, both of which are interpreted as reflections from the top of\na melt body within the crust. The first set of events occurs be-\nneath the axes of each AVR. The second set is imaged beneath the\ntwo offset basins that separate the AVRs. The two sets of reflec-\ntors are interlinked by a lower amplitude reflection event imaged\nin the across-axis profiles. Both sets of melt reflectors are at depth\nof \u223c2.5 km below the seabed, consistent with the depth inferred\nfrom the wide-angle velocity model of RAMESSES I (Navin et al.\n1998).\n(4) The final class of reflection events is imaged under the flanks\nof the median valley.

The\nlayer marked \u2018transition zone (volcanics + dykes)\u2019 was introduced to explain the purple reflector (see Fig. 10).

(c) Comparison of depth and dip of the modelled mid-crustal reflection events to the depth converted real data.\nAlthough the general agreement is seen to be reasonable, the dip of the events is not exactly matched.\ncycles and ridge segmentation in particular. We pose a series of ques-\ntions which we shall now address using the results of data analysis\nand interpretation from all elements of the RAMESSES studies.\nFirst though we assess two specific aspects of the geometric re-\nlations between the reflecting horizons identified in the previous\nsection. The first of these is the AMC reflector. We need to ex-\nplain the existence of an AMC reflector beneath the length of the\nRAMESSES I AVR, beneath the offset basins to the northeast and\nsouthwest of it, and beneath the neighbouring AVR to the north.\nMacGregor et al. (1998) estimated that the magmatic phase of\neach cycle occupies no more than 10 per cent of the cycle time; with\nthe amagmatic phase accounting for at least 90 per cent of the time.\nThe implication of the widespread distribution of AMC reflectors\nin this study is that at the start of a cycle, melt influx to the crust\nmust occur along-axis over a distance substantially greater than that\nof a single AVR (e.g. Peirce et al. 2005). Hence tectono-magmatic\ncycles drive the accretion process not at single isolated AVRs, but\nover a longer length of the ridge\u2014corresponding to a lower order\nof segmentation than a single AVR. Secondly the existence of AMC\nreflectors beneath the offset basins indicates that the distribution\nof AVRs along-axis varies through time: AVRs have a life cycle\nof inception, activity and extinction, before being superseded by\nnew AVRs that are generally centred on different along-axis loca-\ntions. If this is the case the AVR within the RAMESSES I study\narea\u2014although recently rejuvenated by a new tectono-magmatic\ncycle\u2014may be at a relatively mature stage of its overall life cycle. In\ncontrast the offset basins correspond to sites of the earliest stages of\nformation of the next generation of AVRs. These conclusions fit the\nmodel of Peirce et al. (2005), who explain the relationship between\ntectono-magmatic cycles and AVRs in the context of time-varying\nmelt supply to a second-order segment comprising several AVRs.\nA magmatic segment length longer than a single AVR would be\nconsistent with typical second-order segment lengths of 50\u201380 km\nalong the MAR elsewhere in the North Atlantic, and with numerical\nmodels of mantle upwelling that predict length scales of the order\nof 100 km for the spacing between adjacent upwelling regions (e.g.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nMorphology and genesis of slow-spreading ridges 81\n\/k\nm\n\/km\nFigure 19. Origin of dipping crustal discontinuities. Upper Panel: The location of discontinuities imaged on line 30 (red) relative to the seabed. The dashed\nlines, dipping at 55\u25e6, represent possible fault plane orientations which offset the seabed. Lower panels: Model A represents a flat, newly formed seabed within\nthe median valley (grey: crust; blue: sea water). Two discontinuities are shown. The red discontinuity could reflect a sub-horizontal lithological boundary, while\nthe green a dipping fault plane. Model B shows crustal deformation by faulting and the rotation of the fault blocks which comprise the median valley walls.\nModel C shows subsequent in-filling of intrafault block depressions (e.g. by later extrusive flows or debris). In Models B & C the orientation of the red and\ngreen discontinuities is shown. It would be expected that the green discontinuity would only be observed within one of the rotated fault blocks, especially since\nit is now relatively shallowly dipping. The red discontinuities now dip away from the ridge axis which suggests that the dipping seabed offset-related events\nobserved on the seismic profiles are most likely fault related.\nParmentier & Phipps Morgan 1990). Gardiner (2003) and Peirce\net al. (2005) have shown on the basis of residual mantle Bouguer\nanomaly (RMBA) modelling that thickened crust is present beneath\nthe offset basins, consistent with the conclusion that these features\nmark the along-axis sites of newly forming AVRs at the very start\nof their life cycle.\nThe second key set of relationships relates to the distribution of the\nmajor fault systems and the relict AVRs identified from variations\nin layer 2A thickness. The seabed bathymetry (Fig. 1), the faulting\npattern observed on each profile (e.g. Figs 7 and 17) and the layer 2A\nisochron (thickness) and major fault trace map (Fig. 15d), show that\nthe main seabed-offsetting faults\u2014which can be traced across mul-\ntiple profiles\u2014have a range of orientations between AVR-parallel\nand ridge-parallel. Within the median valley, close to the AVRs, the\nfaults tend to be approximately AVR-parallel. Further from the axis,\nthe faults are more likely to be aligned parallel to the overall ridge\ntrend, as noted by Searle et al. (1994). It is these faults that tend\nto form the large escarpments that correspond to the median valley\nwalls. However, it is unusual for these major fault systems to cut\nthrough relict AVRs\u2014instead, the relict AVRs tend to be situated\nbetween major faults, so that they sit within the major fault blocks\nrather than being broken up by them.\n6.1 Key questions\nQ1: Is there (at certain stages of the tectono-magmatic cycle) a\nsingle magma body within the mid-to-lower crust that extends for\nmore than one AVR, along a ridge-parallel (AVR-oblique) direction\nand feeds more than one AVR?\nNo. The distribution of axial melt lens reflection events in both\nthe RAMESSES II MCS and the RAMESSES I wide-angle data sets\nindicates that each AVR is underlain by a separate magma chamber\nwithin the crust (Fig. 15b). Navin et al.\u2019s (1998) across-axis velocity\nmodel shows that this magma chamber contains approximately 20\u2013\n40 per cent partial melt, which is periodically refreshed from the\nmantle on the order of every 20 000\u201360 000 yr (MacGregor et al.\n1998). The crust is thickest beneath the shallowest AVR topography,\nas evidenced by the along-axis velocity model of Navin et al. (1998),\nfree-air gravity anomaly modelling (Navin et al. 1998; Peirce &\nNavin 2002; Gardiner 2003; Peirce et al. 2005) and a residual mantle\nBouguer anomaly low (Gardiner 2003; Peirce et al. 2005). Layer 2A\nis also thicker at the centre of the AVR, as evidenced by a magnetic\nintensity high (Fig. 15a; Lee & Searle 2000; Gardiner 2003; Peirce\net al. 2005) and by the seismic data in this study. The AMC reflector\nreaches its minimum depth below the seafloor at the AVR centre\n(Fig. 15b and Topping 2002). All of this indicates that each AVR is\nfed by a separate melt supply located beneath the AVR centre.\nQ2: Is there an intermittent source of melt within the mantle which\nextends for several AVRs along-axis in a ridge-parallel, AVR-oblique\ndirection, and which is tapped in different locations and at different\ntimes by multiple AVRs spaced along it?\nThere is a range of crustal through to mantle based evidence to\nsupport this concept. Heinson et al. (2000) used MT data to show\nthat the melt source region lies at a depth of 50\u2013100 km below sea\nlevel and that accumulation and transport to the crust is rapid and\nepisodic, there being no evidence from the MT data of any clear con-\nduit or connection between the mantle melt source and the crustal\nmagma body. Peirce & Navin (2002) showed from RMBA mod-\nelling that magma delivery from the mantle to the crust takes place\nalong the ridge trend and that individual AVRs tap this supply at the\ncrustal level, initiating a tectono-magmatic cycle and accommodat-\ning crustal accretion. Continued amagmatic spreading later in the\ncycle is accommodated by AVR-parallel faulting and fracturing. The\nRMBA exhibits two trends. A ridge-parallel long-wavelength nega-\ntive anomaly encompasses several adjacent AVRs. Superimposed on\nthis are shorter wavelength lows associated with, and trending along,\neach AVR. Gardiner (2003) and Peirce et al. (2005) extended this\nmodelling to incorporate the relative ages of AVRs and spreading\nrate calculations. They conclude that a second-order ridge segment\nat this location on the MAR is \u223c70 km in length and comprises mul-\ntiple AVRs, with the AVR at the centre of the second-order segment\nbeing the oldest and most topographically robust, and AVRs heading\ntowards segment ends being progressively younger and shorter.

(Continued.)\nother words, AVRs are \u2018plumbed\u2019 independently at a crustal level,\nbut sit astride a longer-wavelength melt supply from the mantle\nwhich feeds several AVRs over a distance of \u223c70 km along the\nridge trend.\nQ3: Is an AVR a whole-crustal phenomenon, with the AVR axis\nconstructing the entire crust? Or is it simply a layer 2 phenomenon?\nIn other words, is an AVR underlain by an intermittent axial magma\nchamber which runs along its length at mid-lower crustal level and\ncan redistribute melt along-axis within layer 3 as it forms, or is melt\ntransport along-axis confined to sheeted dykes within layer 2, with\nthe AVR itself being merely the expression of lateral melt transport\nat this level from a deeper magma body located beneath the AVR\ncentre?\nSeveral pieces of evidence point towards AVRs being a whole\ncrustal phenomenon. The presence of an AMC reflection event along\nthe entire length of each AVR surveyed implies a crustal magma\nchamber within layer 3 aligned with the AVR axis. The depth bsf of\nthis reflecting horizon (Fig. 15b) and both the along- and across-axis\nwide-angle velocity-depth models (Navin et al. 1998) suggest that\nalthough the melt supply from the mantle to the crust is at least partly\nfocused beneath the AVR centre, this melt is redistributed along-axis\nat a lower crustal level before either solidifying to form the lower\ncrust, or escaping upwards (and in some cases erupting) to form the\nsheeted dyke complex and extrusive rocks of layer 2 and the seabed\nexpression of the AVR. The RMBA modelling of Gardiner (2003)\nand Peirce et al. (2005) for multiple adjacent AVRs at this location\non the MAR shows that each has a low density region within layer\n3 beneath the AVR centre, and each shows thinning of layer 2A and\nof the crust as a whole towards AVR tips. The results of Topping\n(2002) and this study also show layer 2A to be thickest at the AVR\ncentre, implying an enhanced melt supply.\nQ4: Is the tapping of the along-axis mantle melt source confined\nto point locations coincident with AVR centres, or does melt arrive\nin the crust along the entire length of an AVR?\nThe evidence that supports AVRs being a whole crustal phe-\nnomenon also supports melt supply into the crustal magma cham-\nber being an AVR-centred process. The apparent absence of a mixed\nzone of dykes and extrusives at the AVR centre, beneath the shallow-\nest bathymetric point, also supports the point-source, AVR centre\nmelt supply model. However the presence of AMC reflectors be-\nneath offset basins suggests that new AVRs can be initiated at sites\nalong the ridge trend that do not currently coincide with AVR cen-\ntres, but which will in time grow into new AVR systems by means of\nmelt redistribution within the crust along the spreading-orthogonal,\nAVR trend.\nQ5: Are the along-axis sites of melt injection to form AVRs fixed,\nor can AVRs form in new locations along axis?\nThis has already been considered in the previous paragraph. The\nevidence is that AVRs are not fixed in location at specific points\nalong the ridge axis, but can and do form wherever melt accumulates\nwithin the crust along the ridge trend; and that its arrival initiates a\nnew tectono-magmatic cycle, and the growth or rejuvenation of an\nAVR. Further support for this lies in the identification of intact relict\nAVRs and accompanying offset basin pairs, asymmetrically located\nwithin the median valley (Fig. 15). Gardiner (2003) and Peirce et al.\n(2005) have noted that over timescales of less than \u223c1.4 Ma, this\npart of the Reykjanes Ridge is spreading asymmetrically. A natural\nconsequence of this is that overtime, AVRs progressively migrate\noff-axis in the direction of slower spreading. For the currently mag-\nmatically active AVRs, this is in a westward direction from the ridge\naxis. Gardiner (2003) and Peirce et al. (2005) have also noted that the\nfocus of the short wavelength RMBA low associated with each AVR\nis also systematically offset from the AVR in the slower spreading\ndirection, suggesting that the most recent melt influx to the crustal\nmagmatic system has occurred along the ridge-trending focus of up-\nwelling (in an across-axis sense), rather than specifically beneath the\nacross-axis centre of an existing AVR. These observations lead to the\nconclusion that each AVR undergoes a series of tectono-magmatic\ncycles as part of its life cycle, until it has migrated sufficiently far\nto one side of the median valley by asymmetric spreading that it\nis too far from the ridge-trending focus of melt delivery to receive\nfurther melt influxes. At this point the AVR comes to the end of its\nlife span and a new AVR is \u2018born\u2019 elsewhere, more centrally within\nthe median valley. The current offset basins are sites where this is\nhappening now.\nFig. 23 shows the current locations of active AVRs, offset basins,\nand the relict AVRs that can be most reliably identified using a\ncombination of swath bathymetry and layer 2A thickness data and\nthat have been rafted off-axis largely intact. The across-axis spacing\nof these relict AVRs is typically 4\u20137 km, corresponding to a time\ninterval of 0.4\u20130.7 Ma, implying that the life span of an AVR is of\nthis order. Changes in the direction of asymmetric spreading over\ntimescales of no more than 2.4 Ma allow for symmetrical spreading\nof the ridge as a whole over the longer term.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nMorphology and genesis of slow-spreading ridges 83\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\n3500\n4000\n4500\n5000\n5500\n6000\nvelocity m s-1\n1\n2\n3\n4\nD\nep\nth\n\/k\nm\n-16 -14 -12 -10 -8\n12\n3\nD\n2\n3\n4\nT\nW\nT\nT\n\/s\n-16 -14 -12 -10 -8\n12\n3\nE\n\/k\nm\n\/k\nm\n\/k\nm\n\/km\nFigure 20.

Major fault lineations, indicating the escarpments formed\nby normal faults that create the median valley walls, are shown by solid black\nlines. The locations of melt lens reflection events observed beneath AVRs\nand offset basins are shown in red.\nQ6: Do several AVRs constitute a single second-order segment,\nwith some synchronicity of the tectono-magmatic cycle along the\nsecond-order segment?\nThe implication of this question is that AVRs are third-order seg-\nments in the terminology of Macdonald (1982). The relative dating\nof AVRs based on their bathymetric expression, crustal structure\nand magnetic and gravity anomalies by Gardiner (2003), Peirce &\nNavin (2002) and Peirce et al. (2005) suggest that AVRs are inde-\npendent entities at the crustal level, but that they are interconnected\nat the mantle level through their longer time frame melt supply. This\nsupports the hypothesis that several AVRs comprise a second-order\nsegment, and that such a segment can be defined by the wavelength\nof melt delivery from the mantle. In Peirce et al.\u2019s (2005) model,\nall of the AVRs in each second-order segment experience a series\nof tectono-magmatic cycles, but their relative phase in each cycle\nis determined primarily by their along-axis distance from the focus\nof melt delivery to the shallow mantle beneath the centre of the\nsecond-order segment.\nAt the second-order segment level, our observations, results and\nmodels for the Reykjanes Ridge can be compared to similar results\nfrom both slow- and fast-spreading ridges. For example, Dunn et al.\u2019s\n(2005) observations at 35\u25e6N on the MAR lead to a similar conclusion\nthat mantle melt supply is focused towards second-order segment\ncentres and that this melt is redistributed within the crust at lower\ncrustal levels. Their model also features anomalously thick crust and\na low-velocity anomaly at the centre of a second-order segment. In\naddition, they interpret observed seismic anisotropy in the lower\ncrust as reflecting melt-filled dykes which channel melt not only\nfrom the mantle into the crust but also within the crust. The trend of\nthese dykes is observed to be rotated \u223c30\u25e6\u201340\u25e6 away from the ridge-\nparallel direction as a consequence of the \u223c40\u25e6 difference between\nthe ridge trend and the spreading direction. A similar setting exists\nat the Reykjanes Ridge, and Peirce et al. (2005) conclude that such\nfocused melt delivery and redistribution controls the observed third-\norder segmentation pattern and the timing and relative duration of\ntectono-magmatic cycles of accretion.\nSimilarly, at 9\u25e6 30\u2032N on the fast-spreading EPR, Dunn et al. (2000)\nobserve similar patterns and wavelengths in along-axis velocity\nanomalies between the upper crust, lower crust and uppermost man-\ntle, from which they infer that melt supply is currently focused along-\naxis beneath the central third-order (\u223c13 km) segment\u2014bounded by\ntwo devals\u2014of a much longer (\u223c100 km) second-order segment.\nAs part of their study they used seismic anisotropy to investigate\nmantle flow beneath the ridge-axis. They found no evidence for di-\napiric mantle flow, which led them to conclude that, at 9\u25e6 30\u2032N,\nmantle flow and melt migration patterns are effectively decoupled.\nIn other words, at this fast-spreading ridge mantle flow is essen-\ntially 2-D, but melt migration in the shallowest parts of the mantle\nis inherently 3-D.\nThus our conclusions, in terms of the along-axis focusing of melt\nsupply beneath second-order segment centres, are consistent with\nother observations from both the fast-spreading EPR and other sites\nfurther south on the slow-spreading MAR. However, in this case,\nthe combination of oblique spreading and subdued median valley\ntopography\u2014which assist both in sub-seafloor imaging and in the\nidentification of along-axis segmentation patterns\u2014with the recog-\nnition of cycles of tectonic and magmatic activity and the avail-\nability of multiple data types (potential field, swath bathymetry,\ndeep-towed side scan images, wide-angle and multichannel reflec-\ntion seismic, MT and CSEM), have allowed us to go further. For\nthe first time we have been able to link temporal cycles, with two\ndifferent periods, to segmentation patterns at both second and third\norder.\n6.2 The model\u2014nested cycles of accretion\nand orders of segmentation\nThe answers to the above six questions, each supported by exten-\nsive evidence from a wide variety of geophysical techniques and\napproaches, leads to the following summary model for second-\nand third-order segmentation, for the birth, life and death of AVRs\nand for the relationship between temporal and spatial aspects of\naccretionary processes operating within the crust and the upper\n\u223c100 km of the mantle. All of the evidence from this and the\nother RAMESSES studies points to an interrelated set of nested\ncycles of accretion operating on different geological timescales,\nand nested orders of segmentation operating on different along-axis\nwavelengths.\nCycle 1: The tectono-magmatic cycle\nThis shortest time frame cycle comprises repeating patterns of\nAVR rejuvenation, volcanism and magmatic crustal growth followed\nby tectonic dismemberment and amagmatic extension. Each cycle\nlasts typically 20 000\u2013 60 000 yr. The magmatic phase occupies no\nmore than 10 per cent of this, while the amagmatic phase occupies at\nleast 90 per cent. This cycle represents the independent melt refresh\nrate to the crustal magmatic system beneath each AVR.\nCycle 2: Asymmetric spreading and accommodation within the\nmedian valley\nAfter an AVR forms it gradually migrates towards the more slowly\naccreting plate over several tectono-magmatic cycles. This migra-\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n86 C. Peirce et al.\ntion intrinsically limits its life span. Eventually a new AVR forms,\ntypically within an offset basin between AVRs of the previous gen-\neration. Old, extinct AVRs are often preserved more or less intact,\npreferentially on the slower spreading side of the median valley. The\nsense of asymmetry in spreading rate reverses from time to time, to\naccommodate the symmetrical spreading observed over longer ge-\nological time frames (>2.4 Myr in this case). Each newly forming\nAVR tracks across the median valley in the direction of slower ac-\ncretion, which may be in the opposite sense to its predecessor. This\nis a longer cycle of the order of 0.5\u20130.7 Myr. For the AVRs in the\nRAMESSES study area, this implies that an AVR might expect to\ngo through a number (perhaps 10\u201320) of tectono-magmatic cycles\nbetween inception and extinction.\nThird-order Segments: Axial volcanic ridges\nAVRs constitute third-order segments, each being underlain at the\nheight of the magmatic phase of its tectono-magmatic cycle by an\nindependent crustal magma body. The latter redistributes melt both\nat upper crustal and at mid-to-lower crustal level along the AVR\naxis, to generate new oceanic crust.\nSecond-order Segments: Segmented magma supply from the\nmantle\nSeveral AVRs over an along-axis distance of the order of 70 km\nare linked by deeper-seated processes that lead to synchronicity\nof their tectono-magmatic cycles. Within a second-order segment,\nAVRs tend to be largest, most robust and underlain by the thickest\ncrust near the segment centre; and to be progressively shorter and\nless robust towards the segment ends. The onset of the magmatic\nphase of a tectono-magmatic cycle appears to occur first at the centre\nof a second-order segment, and to progressively affect AVRs at later\ntimes towards the segment ends.\nThis model can be tested by geochemical analysis and absolute\ndating of accurately located samples, distributed systematically both\nalong- and across-axis at existing and relict AVRs. If the offset basins\nare currently the sites of the inception of a new generation of AVRs,\nthey should be underlain by thicker crust and by a corresponding\nmagma chamber, both of which can be imaged by wide-angle seis-\nmic means.\n7 C O N C L U S I O N S\nIn this study we have presented the analysis of a grid of 37 mul-\ntichannel reflection profiles acquired as part of the RAMESSES\nproject. The results and conclusions have been integrated with the\nresults of all of the RAMESSES data sets, to reveal a 3-D image of\ncrustal structure beneath a magmatically active axial volcanic ridge\nsegment and its neighbours. Based on this we propose a model of\nlinked ridge segmentation and cyclic crustal accretion. Our main\nfindings are summarized as follows.\n7.1 Processing of multichannel reflection profiles from\nmid-ocean ridges\n(1) Extensive seismic data processing tests showed that, in this mid-\nocean ridge setting, the simplest approach to data processing gen-\nerally gave the best results. In particular, CVSs can be targeted to\nparticular horizons and events. Variable velocity stacking with ei-\nther NMO or pre-stack DMO and migration resulted only in minor\nimprovement.\n(2) At mid-ocean ridges, particularly slow-spreading ridges,\nseabed scattering is a significant problem largely because of out-\nof-plane energy, and neither 2-D migration nor 2-D pre-stack DMO\ncan prevent this from masking intracrustal events. A fully 3-D data\nset and fully 3-D pre-stack processing methods, able to deal with\nthe steep dips and severe lateral velocity gradients, are in principle\nthe only way to fully tackle this problem. However, experience to\ndate has shown that even this approach does not solve the problem\nentirely.\n(3) Two approaches to minimizing and predicting seafloor scat-\ntered signals show that comparable results to full 3-D acquisition\nand processing can be achieved by simple predictive modelling,\nground-truthed against full wavefield pre-stack simulations, if the\nmodels are used to distinguish genuine intracrustal events of geo-\nlogical origin from seafloor scattered noise.\n7.2 Upper crustal structure\n(4) The thickness of the extrusive part of the oceanic crust, layer 2A,\nis greatest at AVR centres, and declines both off-axis from the AVR\nand along-axis towards AVR ends. Both AVR-parallel and ridge-\nparallel trends are observed, with the pattern of on-axis layer 2A\nthickness variation preserved beneath relict AVRs rafted off axis.\nThe central anomaly magnetic high in general follows the ridge\ntrend, but shorter wavelength (AVR scale) magnetization intensity\nhighs coincide with areas of thicker layer 2A\u2014both for currently\nactive AVRs and in some cases for relict AVRs that have now been\nrafted off-axis.\n(5) The AVRs in this study are spreading asymmetrically with\nfaster accretion towards the east. This leads to gradual westward\nmigration of the AVRs within the median valley. This process ulti-\nmately leads to AVRs becoming extinct, to be superseded by a new\ngeneration of AVRs.\n(6) Ridge-parallel faults tend to form in older crust near the edges\nof the median valley. AVR-parallel faults are more likely to form\nwithin the median valley. The major bounding faults of the median\nvalley tend not to cut relict AVRs\u2014so that old extinct AVRs tend to\nbe preserved more or less intact within the major fault blocks, and\nto be rafted off-axis intact and in the direction of slowest spreading.\n7.3 Mid-crust and below\n(7) Each AVR is underlain by a mid-lower crustal magma cham-\nber extending along most of its length and aligned orthogonal to\nspreading direction. Crustal thickening is observed at AVR centres,\nimplying magma supply into the crust occurs primarily here, while\na longer-wavelength supply from the mantle is aligned along the\noverall ridge trend.\n(8) AVRs are a whole crust phenomenon, and not merely a con-\nsequence of melt redistribution by sheeted dykes within layer 2 of\nthe oceanic crust.\n7.4 Melt beneath offset basins\n(9) Mid-crustal melt bodies are present beneath the two offset basins\n(\u03b1 and \u03b2 in Fig. 23) southwest and northeast of the RAMESSES\nI AVR. These will develop into new AVRs, and we would expect\nthat overtime the sense of spreading rate asymmetry will reverse. If\nthe inception of new AVRs is accompanied by reversals in the sense\nof asymmetric spreading, this will tend to lead to extinct AVRs\nbeing alternately rafted off-axis in opposite directions, favouring\ntheir preservation.\n(10) The east\u2013west spacings of relict AVRs and basins\u2014\nevidenced by both bathymetry and layer 2A thickness\u2014is of order\n5\u20137 km, corresponding to a cycle time of order 0.5\u20130.7 Myr at the\naverage spreading half-rate here of 10 mm a\u22121.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors, GJI, 168, 59\u201389\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nMorphology and genesis of slow-spreading ridges 87\n7.5 The proposed model\n(11) The integrated interpretation of all data sets acquired as part of\nthe RAMESSES projects, together with other data acquired along\nthe entirety of the Reykjanes Ridge, has enabled us to propose a\nmodel for crustal accretion at this part of the slowly and obliquely\nspreading Reykjanes Ridge which links two orders of along-axis\nsegmentation with two nested cycles of AVR inception, activity and\nextinction, and tectono-magmatic seafloor spreading.
