INTRODUCTION\nAmorphous hydrogenated carbon ~a-C:H! films have re-\nceived considerable attention over the last decade due to\ntheir unique \u2018\u2018diamondlike\u2019\u2019 chemical, electrical, optical, and\nmechanical properties.1,2 Low-pressure rf plasma-enhanced\nchemical-vapor deposition ~rf-PECVD! is one of the most\nwidely used techniques, as it is possible to obtain films of\nwidely varying properties depending on the plasma param-\neters used. The substrate negative self-bias, as influenced by\nthe various parameters such as pressure, flow rate, power,\netc., has been identified as the most critical in determining\nthe final film characteristics, with hard carbon films being\nproduced at moderately high bias voltages ~400\u2013600 V! and\npolymeric films at low bias voltages ~,100 V!.3\nFurther, the properties of the films are found to depend\nstrongly on their microstructure, i.e., sp3\/sp2 ratio and H\ncontent. As well as varying the hydrocarbon feedstock,4 ad-\nditives such as hydrogen5,6 and the inert gases6\u20139 have been\nused in an attempt to further modify the structure of these\nfilms.\nRecent interest surrounding the induced structural\nchanges of nitrogen inclusion10,11 is due to the predictions of\nLiu and Cohen12 that the bulk modulus of a hypothetical\ncompound b5C3N4, structurally analogous to b-silicon ni-\ntride, may be close to that of diamond. Diamondlike carbon\n~DLC! films with both sp3 and sp2 bonding configurations\nare under varying degrees of compressive stress. It has been\nreported10,13,14 that the internal stress considerably decreases\nwith the addition of nitrogen, without sacrificing hardness,\nup to a N incorporation of 2 at. %. At higher concentrations\nhardness is reduced due to the development of graphitic do-\nmains.

In terms of macroscopic film\nproperties, it has been shown that nitrogen incorporation can\ncause a reduction of the electrical resistivity14,16,18,20 and op-\ntical band gap.14,16,18\u201320 From conductivity measurements,\nAmir and Kalish16 and Schwan et al.14 determined that nitro-\ngen has a low doping efficiency in a-C:H films. Recent\nresults,21\u201323 however, indicate that a-C:H:N is a superior\nelectronic material to a-C:H. It is timely, therefore, to inves-\ntigate the plasma activated processes which occur during rf-\nPECVD deposition of a-C:H:N films.\nFurther, studies to date have centered on the correlation\nof film properties with nitrogen partial pressure, the other\ndeposition parameters being fixed. However, it is well\nknown that with rf-PECVD-deposited undoped a-C:H,4 film\nstructure depends strongly on the ion bombardment energy\nof the species involved in the film growth which is a function\nof the deposition parameters, particularly bias voltage. Thus,\nit is relevant to ascertain the effects of bias variations on film\nproperties of a-C:H:N. In this article we report on th optical\nemission spectroscopy ~OES! of CH4\/N2 plasmas. The gas\nphase composition, i.e., the nature and concentration of vari-\nous species, fragmentation of ions, degree of ionization, and\ngas phase collisions, all play a part in determining the nature\nof the resultant films. OES is a convenient and effective tech-\nnique to detect and monitor a number of transient species\nsuch as excited atoms, ions, and molecules, with varying\nplasma parameters.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe rf plasmas of CH4, N2, and CH4\/N2 gas mixtures\nwere generated in a 13.56 MHz capacitively coupled parallel\nplate electrode reaction chamber. The same configuration is\nused to deposit amorphous carbon films, details of which\nhave been described previously.7 A commercial Verity Scan-\nview OES system was used to collect the optical emission\nspectra. It incorporated an EP200 Msd Monochromator and\nR928HA photomultiplier tube detector. The spectra were\ncollected from the rf plasmas through a quartz window in the72277\/7\/$10.00 \u00a9 1996 American Institute of Physics\nIP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloplasma chamber wall. They represent an average of the ob-\nserved plasma since localized fiber optic probes were not\nused in this instance. Emission spectra, in the range 300\u2013900\nnm, were collected for different plasmas generated by vary-\ning the plasma parameters as described below:\n~1! power ~30\u2013210 W!, at fixed pressure ~100 mTorr! and\nN2\/CH4 ratio ~0.25!;\n~2!

RESULTS\nTypical optical emission spectra of CH4, N2 and CH4\/N2\nplasmas are shown in Figs. 1~a!, 1~b!, and 1~c!, respectively.\nAs reported in previous studies,24\u201326 the main emission peaks\nin the CH4 spectrum @Fig. 1~a!# correspond to the CH 430\nand 390 nm systems, and the hydrogen Balmer lines ~Ha at\nFIG. 1.

Numerous H2\nmolecular bands are also visible, particularly centered at 463\nand 602 nm.\nIn the N2 spectrum @Fig. 1~b!#, a variety of nitrogen\nemission peaks span the measured spectral region. The four\nbands in the visible region, with bandheads at approximately\n540, 580, 650, and 750 nm, are commonly associated with\nthe first positive system of the neutral nitrogen molecule,\nthese are thought to occur as a result of the recombination of\nground-state nitrogen ~4S! atoms through a three-body colli-\nsion process with a third body.27 The peaks in the UV region\ncentered at 316, 337, 380, 400, and 420 nm correspond to the\nmost intense peaks of the second positive molecular series of\nneutral nitrogen and the sharp peaks at 391 and 428 nm are\nthe most intense of the first-negative system of N21 molecular\nion transitions.28,29 Both these species can be produced by\ndirect electronic excitation ~ionization excitation! of ground-\nstate N2 molecules.29,30 Further, the second positive N2 mol-\necules may be generated by radiative recombination of an\nelectron with an ionized N2 molecule in its ground state.29\nThese OES lines have been reported by other workers.30\u201332\nThe sharp peaks rising above the first positive system at\n631.3, 673.7, and 714.6 nm have been observed by Nam\net al.33 in a rf plasma of SiH4\u2013NH3\u2013N2, but only identified\nas emission lines originating from various excited states of\nN2. Sharp bandheads in the near-IR ~NI! spectral region cen-\ntered at 745, 821, and 869 have been observed27,31 and iden-\ntified as atomic nitrogen bands. The intensity of our lines\nleads us to believe that they are also due to atomic nitrogen\ntransitions. Spectral lines are listed for atomic nitrogen at\nthese wavelengths.34\u201336 There are allowed atomic NI transi-\ntions in the 627.5\u2013632.2 nm range and 670.6\u2013674.1 nm\nrange. There is also a N II transition in the 713.9\u2013725.7 nm\nrange. The ionization energy for such species ~25.1 eV! is,\nhowever, much higher than for N I ~14.54 eV!. The propor-\ntionality of the three lines remains constant regardless of the\nplasma conditions, thus we suspect that the three lines are\ndue to N I.\nIn the CH4\/N2 spectrum @Fig. 1~c!#, lines due to CH4 are\nalmost completely obscured by those due to nitrogen. Fur-\nther, in the mixed plasma there is the enhancement of the N2\nsecond positive bands relative to the N2 first positive band,\nand the development of a band system with a bandhead at\n388.3 nm which can be ascribed to CN. The CN violet sys-\ntem has three strong sequences with heads at 421.6, 388.3,\nand 359 nm ~the 388.3 head being the strongest!28 which\nhave been observed by other workers.37\u201339 In our system, the\n359 nm band is obscured by the strong N2 second positive\nbands but when the 388.3 nm band is well developed, bands\nassociated with the 421.6 nm sequence appear.\nThe energy level transitions and likely excitation pro-\ncesses for all the species described above are listed in Table\nI and their energy level diagrams are plotted in Fig. 2.\nThe CH ~431.4 nm! band and the Hb ~486.1 nm! band\nare not obscured by nitrogen peaks and have been monitored\nwith the variation of plasma conditions. The CN peak ~388.3\nnm! and the strongest peaks due to the different nitrogen\nspecies were also monitored. These include the N2 second\npositive peak at 357.7 nm, the N21 peak at 391.0 nm, the N2Clay et al.\nP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloaTABLE I.

OES analysis\nThe most striking observations from this study are the\npreviously unidentified sharp nitrogen spectral lines which\nwe ascribe to atomic N, the development of CN bands, the\nenhancement of N2 second positive spectral line intensities\nwith the addition of CH4, and the higher intensities of spe-\ncies originating from N2 relative to those from CH4. These\npoints, together with the variation of spectral line intensities\nunder different plasma conditions, are discussed below.\nUntil recently,31 atomic N had not been observed in a rf\nsystem. As the electron temperature Te is greater in a micro-\nwave discharge ~Te;8 eV! than in a rf discharge (Te;3\neV!,40 the nitrogen is expected to be more highly activated in\na microwave discharge, leading to longer-lived atomic nitro-\ngen atoms. In a rf discharge, nitrogen atoms would be ex-\npected to be shorter lived and to recombine rapidly into mo-7229Clay et al.\nP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownlolecular nitrogen. Vaudo and co-workers,31 however, found\nthat the intensity of atomic nitrogen peaks relative to the\nmolecular bands was much stronger from a rf rather than a\nmicrowave source. The atomic nitrogen in their system, re-\nsults from the dissociation of neutral ~first positive! nitrogen.\nThe atomic nitrogen lines in our system configuration and\nprocess window differ from those of Vaudo and co-workers;\nthis could be a consequence of the higher intensities of sec-\nond positive N2. Dissociative reactions @Table I, Eq. ~10!# of\nthis more energetic molecular nitrogen will result in atomic\nN with an increased lifetime of the higher energy levels and\nthus an increased probability of atomic transitions from these\nFIG. 3.

A further observation supporting this postulate is the\nfact that the intensity variations of these atomic nitrogen\npeaks mirror those of the second positive N2 peaks under\ndifferent conditions ~Fig. 3!.\nSpectral lines due to CN are readily seen by OES,28 due\nto its low activation energy ~Fig. 2!. It arises from the reac-\ntion of the active nitrogen species with carbon species in the\nplasma. A number of routes leading to its appearance has\nbeen reported.41 One route is the immediate formation of CN\nfrom chemical interaction between these species @Table I,\nEq. ~13!#. A further route is the initial formation of a stable\nintermediate compound containing C\u2014N bonding which\nthen yields CN on further reaction with active plasma species\n@Table I, Eqs. ~14! and ~15!#.\nCollisional interaction between plasma particles plays a\nsignificant role in activating reactive species. Penning ioniza-\ntion and dissociation processes @Table I, Eq. ~8! and ~11!# are\nespecially effective in plasma excitation processes because\nthey have large capture cross sections. It is known from mass\nspectroscopic studies42,43 that there are a number of excited\nCmHn species ~ions and radicals! present in the plasma.\nThese species tend to undergo collisional reactions, rather\nthan deexcitation processes which result in OES lines, and\ncould be acting as Penning agents in these nitrogen activa-\ntion reactions, resulting in the promotion of the N2 second\npositive bands. This enhancement was also observed by Sug-\nimoto and co-workers,32 with the addition of helium to the\nnitrogen plasma. They suggested that molecules of N2 in\ntheir ground state are not directly ionized by electrons in rf\nplasmas but excitation of nitrogen molecules occurs due to\nHe Penning effects.\nIn a rf discharge the plasma is sustained by ions from the\nnegative glow discharge diffusing to the glow-sheath bound-\nary where they undergo acceleration, driven by the large\nelectric field across the electrode sheath, and collide with the\nelectrode surface with a high energy causing secondary elec-\ntron and sputtered atom emission. The secondary electrons\nare accelerated back through the sheath and provide the pri-\nmary energy feed to support the glow discharge ionization\nprocess, through direct ionization and charge transfer result-\ning from the high-energy tail of the emitted electron distri-\nbution. It has been reported44,45 that the magnitude of the ion\nenergy, is dependent upon the sheath electric-field\u2013to\u2013\npressure ratio (E\/p) which also affects the optical emission\nintensity.\nThe relative emission intensity for a given transition (i\n2 j) of a species X is given by the integral\nIX~ i2 j !5neNE S 2Em D\n1\/2\ns~E ! f ~e !dE , ~1!\nwhere ne is the electron density, N is the number density of\nthe gas molecule, s is the emission cross section ~electron-\nimpact excitation!, E and me are the electron energy and\nmass, and f (E) is the electron energy distribution function\n~EEDF!. If it is assumed that the direct electron impact from\nthe ground to the emitting state is the dominant excitation\nprocess, and that radiation is the dominant deactivation pro-\ncess, the intensity of the optical emission of a specie equatesClay et al.\nP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloadirectly to the associated impact inelastic collision reaction.\nThe measured intensity of this emission line may be ex-\npressed by\nIX5CX~E !hX@X# . ~2!\nThe rate coefficient CX(E) is a function of the energy of the\nelectrons which is affected by discharge parameters. It is\ndirectly proportional to E\/p . The excitation efficiency\n[hX5ke(E)ne] is a function of the density and energy dis-\ntribution function of the electrons, since ke(E) is the excita-\ntion rate constant, and ne is the electron density. The con-\ncentration of the reactant species is given by [X].\nThe fact that the relative intensities of OES active\nplasma species derived from N2 are much higher than for the\nspecies derived from CH4, even though the activation energy\nof CH is low ~Fig. 2! can be explained with reference to Eq.\n~2!. The rate coefficient CX(E) is constant since the plasma\nparameters are fixed and the concentration of CH4 is higher\nthan that of N2. The difference in band intensities of species\nfrom N2 and CH4 must, therefore, be due to a higher excita-\ntion efficiency hX of N2 relative to CH4. This reflects the fact\nthat the nitrogen species are principally generated by primary\nelectron excitation @Table I, Eqs. ~7!, ~9!, and ~10!#, whereas\nthe methane species are generated through secondary colli-\nsional processes @Table I, Eqs. ~1!\u2013~5!#.\nThe increase in the intensities of all species with power\n@Fig. 3~a!#, up to a saturation level, can also be explained by\nreferring to Eq. ~2!. DebRoy, Kumar, and Tankala46 showed\nthat electron temperature increases with bias voltage and that\nelectron density increases with an increase in electron tem-\nperature. Under our conditions ~30\u2013210 W!, at fixed pressure\nthe bias voltage increases from 230 to 2300 V, thus, the rf\nfield strength ~and therefore CX! will increase resulting in an\nincrease in electron temperature Te and electron density.\nThis will cause an increase of all reaction processes and thus\nan increase in the intensities of all the observed optical emis-\nsion bands, up to a saturation point, after which further in-\ncreases in Te will cease to influence the electron density. The\nfact that the N21 intensities increase more steeply than the\nother species of N2 is due to its higher activation energy for\ndirect electron impact excitation. The CN species, on the\nother hand, result from dissociative excitation processes\n@Table I, Eqs. ~13!\u2013~15!# which have higher activation\nthresholds than direct excitation processes.\nIt can be seen @Fig. 3~b!# that as the N2 partial pressure\nincreases, there is an initial increase in the emission intensity\nof nitrogen species, including CN, with a corresponding de-\ncrease of CH and H intensities. These trends level off at\nhigher N2 concentrations. This is expected since the concen-\ntration of N2 molecules @@X# in Eq. ~2!# and, therefore, their\ncapture cross section has increased. As all other parameters\nare fixed, this increase will, however, be finite since there is\na limited electron density. The slight decrease in CH and H\nintensities could be due to further interactions of N2 and CH4\nderived species.\nWith pressure @Fig. 3~c!#, there is an initial decrease in\nthe optical line intensities of all species followed by a further\nincrease in intensity for all species apart from N21 , then a\ntailing off of all species at higher pressures.

Phys., Vol. 79, No. 9, 1 May 1996\nded\u00ac27\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIpressure will cause a decrease in the bias voltage, and, there-\nfore, electron temperature and electron density. Referring\nback to Eq. ~2! it will also decrease the rate coefficient for\ndirect electron impact excitation processes. The initial de-\ncrease is likely to reflect this reduction in Te . On the other\nhand, the mean free path decreases with increasing pressure,\nresulting in an increase in the cross sections of collisional\ninteractions and therefore the population of excited states for\nthe various species present in the plasma. This population\nincrease promotes a corresponding increase in the emission\nintensity of the plasma, but this effect is finite. As the elec-\ntron temperature and density continue to decrease, the bulk\nelectrons have insufficient energy to sustain these competi-\ntive collisional and charge transfer processes. The fact that\nthe N21 does not show this increase tends to confirm the\nabove observation that it is produced exclusively from direct\nbulk electron impact excitation.\nIt is believed that the competitive collisional and charge\ntransfer processes described above, conspire to promote the\nobserved spectral intensity signal peak-to-trough transition\nshown in Fig. 3~c!, close to 500 mTorr. To a first order, it is\nreasonable to propose that changes in mean free path, elec-\ntron energy distribution and efficiency, and ionization type\nand efficiency, resulting from varying the total operating gas\npressure ~hence mean free path and reaction cross sections!\nand the plasma frequency and power, will promote the in-\nverted S-shaped intensity curves observed.\nB. Film growth\nIt is well known3 that the properties of a-C:H films,\ndeposited using a self-negatively biased rf-PECVD system,\ndepend strongly on the deposition parameters. The key pa-\nrameter in determining the material properties, i.e, sp3 bond-\ning, film density, and hydrogen concentration, is the bom-\nbardment ion energy. This is a function of the self-bias\nvoltage, which in turn is a function of the rf power coupled\ninto the plasma.47 According to models for sp3-rich a-C\nformation,47,48 at moderate ion bombardment energies\n~;50\u2013200 eV! the subsurface penetration by energetic ions\ncan lead to densification or, from an alternate viewpoint,\nincrease film stress. The densification\/stress increase can in\nturn promote metastable sp3 bonding in the films.48,49 Ener-\ngetic ion bombardment of the surface causes sputtering and\nlowers the H content and affects the growth rate.\nAs mentioned above, the magnitude of the ion energy\nand influence is dependent upon th sheath electric-field\u2013to\u2013\npressure ratio E\/p . The electric field is directly proportional\nto the self-bias voltage Vb which increases with power and\ndecreases with pressure. At a fixed pressure, an increase in\npower increases the ion energy and fluence, due to the in-\ncreased electric field,44 as a direct consequence of the in-\ncrease in the electron temperature and electron density. For a\ngiven driven electrode power, an increase in pressure causes\na decrease in electric field and therefore plasma electron tem-\nperature and density which results in a lower bombardment\nenergy and fluence. With increasing pressure, there is also an\nincrease in the average collision rate ~reduced mean free\npath!, which will further affect the ion energy and fluence.\nMoreover, Economou and co-workers45 observed that the7231Clay et al.\nP\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloadcharged particle density exhibits a sharp decrease at lower\npressure promoting a similar response from the ion fluence.\nFurther, Catherine44 observed that although ion bombard-\nment is the key parameter in determining the film micro-\nstructure, by influencing densification, sputtering, and for-\nward transport effects, adsorption of the plasma-dissociated\nactive species follows a P20.5 law and governs the growth\nkinetics.\nIn interpreting the effect of a-C:H:N film properties with\nchanges in the plasma parameters and correlating them to the\nobserved changes in the OES spectra, these effects have to\nbe considered. We have found that for the deposition of\na-C:H:N films the growth rate, at constant power, is lower\nthan for the a-C:H films deposited from pure methane, and\nthat as the power ~bias voltage! is increased, the growth rate\ndecreases to a point where no growth is observed. A reduc-\ntion in deposition rate has also been reported with rising\nnitrogen partial pressure.16,17 We have also observed that\nwith increasing pressure, there is a trough-peak-trough\ngrowth regime.\nIt is not possible to monitor all the active CmHn species\nusing OES; however, the results indicate that reactive nitro-\ngen species are more easily generated than methane-derived\nspecies. Nitrogen can be introduced into the films either\nthrough the generation of active CxNy-containing species in\nthe plasma or at the growth surface. The observation of CN\npeaks in the OES suggest that generation of active CN spe-\ncies does take place in the plasma under the experimental\nconditions observed.\nSeveral factors may be contributing to the observed re-\nduction of the growth rate of the films with the inclusion of\nnitrogen. As stated above, nitrogen species appear to be more\nreactive than the CH4 precursor species, therefore, an in-\ncreased flux of nitrogen in the plasma will result in a dilution\nof CH4 precursor species and their collisional reactions. This\nwill cause a reduction in the concentration of the molecular\nCmHn* species necessary for film formation. The observation\nthat the CN OES peak develops while the CH peak de-\ncreases, with increased nitrogen partial pressure @Fig. 3~b!#,\nsuggests that this occurs.\nAs power, and therefore bias, increases the ion bombard-\nment energy and ion flux increases, resulting in a higher\nsputter yield. The OES shows high concentrations of nitro-\ngen species ~especially N21!. The experimental data suggest\nthat in this regime the arrival energy and flux of N21 is suf-\nficient to effect sputter etching. This sputter etch process is\nlikely to be of a chemical\/physical nature, much as the effect\nof hydrogen.5,6\nIn the low-pressure ~100 mTorr! high-Vb regime, the low\ngrowth rates can be explained by the high sputter yield of\nN21 , as described above. At intermediate pressure ~400\nmTorr!, it can be seen from the OES that the concentration\nof nitrogen species has dropped. Preliminary results show\nthat the deposition rate and nitrogen inclusion ~infrared! in-\ncreases in this regime. The increase in deposition rate, as\npressure increases and bias voltage decreases, could be due\nto a reduction in the arrival ion energy and consequently, the\ninfluence of the N2 ion-induced sputter yield.7232 J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 79, No. 9, 1 May 1996\ned\u00ac27\u00acSep\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIn the high-pressure ~800 mTorr! low-bias regime, the\nOES @Fig. 3~c!# shows that the concentration of N21 does not\nincrease as do the other N2-derived species. The arrival ion\nenergy will be very low and N21 sputter etching will be much\nreduced. There is, however, a drop in film deposition rate\ndue to the ion energy and fluence at the surface being low.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe optical emission spectra of CH4\/N2 13.56 MHz, rf\nplasma discharges, used for the deposition of a-C:H~N!\nfilms, have been studied. Emission peaks due to CH, H, and\nH2 are observed for CH4, and peaks due to molecular N2 first\npositive, N2 second positive transitions, and N21 are observed\nfor N2. We have also observed emission peaks which can be\nassigned to atomic N derived from higher-energy transitions\nresulting from the dissociation of the N2 second positive\nmolecules. In the mixed CH4\/N2 plasmas, emission peaks\ndue to CN have been identified and suggest that plasma re-\nactions are important in the growth of a-C:H:N films. The\nintensities of the lines due to N2 species are much higher\nthan those due to CH4 species. This reflects the fact that the\nactivation energies for the generation of energetic nitrogen\nspecies are lower than for methane-derived species. The en-\nhancement of the N2 second positive intensities, with added\nmethane, have been ascribed to Penning ionization processes\ninduced by interaction on N2 with CmHn* species in the\nplasma.\nThe variations in the optical emission intensities of the\nobserved plasma species, that are induced by changes in the\nplasma processing parameters ~i.e., power, N2 partial pres-\nsure, total pressure!, can be explained in terms of modifica-\ntions to electron temperature and density, reactive species\nconcentrations, and their associated arrival fluxes and activ-\nity states. Further, these can be correlated to film growth\nrates. Particularly, the decrease in film growth rate with in-\ncreasing power ~bias voltage!, to a point where there is no\nfilm growth, is considered to be due to the increasing ener-\ngetic N21 acting as an efficient chemical\/physical sputter\nagent. Due to the complexity of the relationship between the\nplasma parameters and the emission spectra, these observa-\ntions are qualitative in nature. Further work in this area needs\nto be based on a quantitative interpretation of the emission\nspectra and correlation with other measurements of the\nplasma parameters.\n1H. Tsai and D. B. Bogy, J.
