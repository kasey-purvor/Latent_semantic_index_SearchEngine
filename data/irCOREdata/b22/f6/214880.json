In this chapter, some \nof these competing analytical perspectives are considered briefly. This is followed by an \nassessment of some of the issues that are deserving of deeper investigation. Although \nsome analysts envisage a relatively smooth progression towards equitable access and use \nof these technologies in ways that, on balance, are empowering for citizens and \nconsumers, others do not. In many instances claims about the nature of this relationship \nare supported by weak empirical evidence or underpinned by a disavowal of the notion \nthat technologies are political. In this contribution, my aim is to set out the foundation for \nthe assertion that the ground is very flimsy for the claim that innovation in ICTs \ninevitably favors decentralization, the flattening of hierarchy, or the automatic \nempowerment of human beings.  \n \n<H1>Analytical perspectives in contention<\/H1> \n 12 \nICTs always have been entwined with changes in society, an association that has been \nexamined in detail by historians.\n2\n In some cases these technologies have been \ncharacterized as being revolutionary because of the new opportunities they offer for \nmediated relationships. Digital technologies are often depicted in the consultancy \nliterature as calling into existence a new inclusive, social, and economic order (Le \nGuyader 2009), but a more measured response typically indicates that these technologies \nbecome woven into society in very complex ways. We can regard ICTs as being neither \nnecessarily transformational nor completely malleable in the hands of their users \n(Mansell et al. 2007; Mansell and Silverstone 1996b). We have several decades of \nscholarly research that consistently confirms this observation.\n3\n \n Nevertheless, even today, in the academy, the most predominant analytical \napproach in the social sciences to innovations in ICTs remains diffusion theory, a theory \nthat focuses principally on technology and individual behavior. In The Diffusion of \nInnovations, Rogers (Rogers 1962, 1995) aimed to explain how to inculcate awareness \nand enthusiasm for technical innovations such that even those individuals most resistant \nto their adoption might do so. By 1995, when the fourth edition of his book was \npublished, he had modified his theory to account for many of the contextual factors that \ninfluence the diffusion of new technologies. Even so, the central concern in this \ntheoretical model remained explaining the rate and direction of adoption of new \ntechnologies such as ICTs.\n4\n Research in the diffusion of innovations tradition has \ncontinued to develop and inform new generations of scholarly work on the patterning and \nscaling of networking\u2014both technical and social (Monge and Contractor 2003)\u2014as well \nas in the burgeoning fields of advertizing and marketing that are linked to behavioral \n 13 \ntheories of consumer decision making (Egan 2008; Van den Bulte and Joshi 2007). Most \nstudies in this tradition presume that consumption is a matter of individual choice and \nthat all such consumption is desirable. The social implications of consumption, the ethical \nissues raised by privacy intrusions and the personalization of ICT-based services, and the \nsustainability of intensely networked and mediated environments supported by ICTs are \nsimply not considered.  \n In line with the predominance of the diffusionist tradition, there are substantial \nefforts to measure the ICT diffusion process. This work started in the US with the early \ncontributions of Machlup (1962) and Porat and Rubin (1977), but it has since become a \nglobal ambition to benchmark progress toward the information society, knowledge \neconomy, or whatever label is used to capture the phenomenon whereby information (or \ncommunication) services make a growing contribution to economic activity and \ninformation-related occupations as compared to industrial output or agriculture (Bell \n1973; Ito 1991). Work in this tradition proceeds through the development of indicators \nand surveys that enable comparisons of a country\u2019s or region\u2019s investment performance \nand use of ICTs (OECD 2005; UNCTAD 2009), the assumption being that \u2018more\u2019 is \nalways better. \n The diffusion of innovations tradition is complemented by economic analysis of \ncharacteristics of information. Economic analysis has been brought to bear on the market \nexchange of information (Brousseau and Curien 2007: 21). As Brousseau and Curien \npoint out, \u201cwhile ICTs seem to provide the technical support which should favor the \nefficient performance of an ultra-competitive market economy, they make information a \npublic good, thus sowing the seeds of a cooperative economy.\u201d This means that while \n 14 \nsome analysts are very enthusiastic about the growth and potential profitability of \nmarkets for information, others stress that traditional intellectual property rights \nprotection should not be used to hinder the growth of an open, sharing, more cooperative \nenvironment that fosters artistic, educational, and scientific endeavor.\n5\n They argue that \nthe market exchange of information needs to be complemented by analysis of the benefits \nand costs of information exchange, less encumbered by the costs of negotiating property \nrights (Benkler and Nissenbaum 2006; David 1995, 2005; Lessig 2001; Mansell and \nSteinmueller 2000). While attention has been directed to the consequences of persistent \neconomic power in media, information, and communication markets (McChesney and \nSchiller 2003; Mosco 1996; Schiller 1999), there has been a substantial amount of \nenthusiasm about the Internet and new opportunities for self-publishing using social \nnetworking sites as a means of consumer and citizen empowerment.  \n If we turn away from these two dominant traditions, towards the work of more \ncritical scholars who are informed by theoretical traditions that are more open to \nuncertainty and to the messiness of the everyday lives of the producers and users of ICTs, \nwe find many studies of the relationships between ICT networks, information flows, and \ntime\u2013space reconfiguration. This work has proliferated since the mid-1990s (Castells \n1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2009; Slevin 2000; van Dijk 2006). Undertaken from many \ndifferent perspectives, there is considerable agreement that it is in the analysis of the \ninterplay between online and offline activities that we are likely to gain purchase on the \nsocial, political, and cultural consequences of innovations in ICTs (Orgad 2007). While \nmany new processes and practices are enabled by the spread of ICTs, warranting in some \ninstances the label \u201crevolutionary,\u201d there are also continuities with earlier developments. \n 15 \nAnd indeed, we have skeptical accounts that are dubious about whether societies are \nbeing radically altered by the spread of ICTs (Garnham 2000; Webster 2006).  \n Studies in the diffusion of innovations tradition neglect the fact that ICTs are \nimplicated in complex power relationships. But in those traditions that do consider power \nrelations there are bifurcations between macro- and micro-analytical approaches. As \nMattelart suggests, in situated accounts emphasizing mediations and interactions there is \na tendency to overlook aspects of technology production and a \u201ctechnoscientific system \nremains, more than ever, marked by the inequality of exchanges\u201d (Mattelart 1996\/2000: \n109). Alternatively, studies that privilege analysis of political and economic power \nsometimes neglect the agency of individuals.  \n Research in the physical sciences, computer science, and engineering is mainly \ndevoted to promoting innovations in ICTs (Mansell and Collins 2005) and studies of \nubiquitous computing, software automation, the Semantic Web, and or \u201cknowledge \nmanagement\u201d receive substantial financial support as compared to studies informed by \nthe social science disciplines, but the former give little attention to the uncertainties of the \ninnovation process\u2014ethical, social, economic, or political. Some of those concerned to \npromote more rapid diffusion of ICTs\u2014whether the Internet or the mobile phone\u2014turn \nto philosophy to defend their assertion that a wholly new way of thinking is called for in \norder to understand the consequences of ICTs. However, since it is the interpenetration of \nthe old and the new technologies, and the older and newer practices and meanings that \nmatter for the social order, it seems essential to ensure that the place and consequences of \nthese technologies are considered through an analytical lens that deploys concepts of \npower and the political to make sense of the transformations that are underway. Thus, we \n 16 \nneed to apply some of our existing ways of thinking in the emerging context of mediated \nnetworks. \n \n \n<H1>ICTs, power and inequality<\/H1> \nApplying some of our existing ways of thinking in the emerging context of mediated \nnetworks to make sense of ongoing transformations is especially important because the \nproduction and consumption of ICTs are marked by inequalities, frequently, though not \nalways, reflecting the inequalities of societies. As a result the technology diffusion \nprocess itself needs to be understood in the context of how these technologies enable \nchanging social practices, offer new methods of communication and information sharing, \nencourage network forms of organization, and give rise to new learning dynamics and \ncommercial practices. We need a basis on which to assess the desirability of encouraging \ninnovations of certain kinds but perhaps not of others because, while feasible, they may \nbe deemed unethical or simply unhelpful. Judgment\u2014individual and collective\u2014is \nnecessary. Perhaps one of the greatest requirements is for a more broadly based \nacknowledgment of the need for new literacies and communicative resources for \nexpressing cultural identity, fostering new kinds of \u201ccommunity\u201d and mediating \nexperience (Livingstone 2007, 2008; Livingstone et al. 2008).  \n In essence, we require deeper insights into the embeddedness of ICTs in different \ncontexts to understand how mediation processes are influenced by them, and we need a \nconsideration of their social consequences, but we also require an acknowledgment of \npower and the political in all mediated relationships. One approach that has been helpful \n 17 \nover the past 30 years in this respect is the analysis of the dynamics of \u201ctechno-\neconomic\u201d systems. This work, particularly through its focus on the qualitative aspects of \nthe diffusion of ICTs, has shown that changes in technological, organizational, social, \ncultural, and political systems occur unevenly in time and space. Each system or \nsubsystem of the innovation process encompasses inequality and power dynamics that \ninfluence the distribution of resources and the new spaces of opportunity and insurgency \navailable to any given actor. However, helpful as this tradition of research is in drawing \nattention to the dynamics of such systems, most of those contributing to it do not \nacknowledge the need for an explicitly theorized account of power. There have been \nattempts to do so, of course, but the core of this tradition remains tightly focused on the \ntechnologies and the economic impacts of their diffusion.  \n In Communication by Design: The Politics of Information and Communication \nTechnologies, we sought to link the \u201ctechno-economic\u201d tradition to studies of the social \nprocesses, power relations, and agency of technology producers and consumers. As a \nresult, we were able to make observations about ICT innovations such as the following. \nThese technologies \u201craise profound concerns about the way advanced information and \ncommunication technologies influence industry, government policy and our every day \nlives \u2026 and about their capacity to contribute to a more equitable and democratic \nsociety\u201d (Mansell and Silverstone 1996a: 1). We asserted that an understanding of the \ncomplexity of the innovation process was not approachable through traditions typified by \nthe dominant diffusion of innovations approach. This complex cluster of technological \nand social interdependencies required then, as it does now, a multidisciplinary \n 18 \nperspective (Mansell and Silverstone 1996b). However, that in itself is insufficient unless \npower relations are also examined.  \n We suggested that the ICT innovation process should be treated as a \u201cdialectic in \nwhich power is exercised in the production and use of technological artefacts as well as \nin the institutionalization of behavior\u201d (Mansell and Silverstone 1996a: 7) and that this \nentails a methodological challenge to undertake work at the individual, household, firm, \nor organizational levels. What cries out for investigation is the politics of the innovation \nprocess itself. A process that involves \u201ca politics engaged in by participants\u2014individuals \nas well as institutions \u2026 It is, finally, a politics deeply embedded not just within the \ninstitutions that design and distribute technologies and services, but within the technology \nitself \u2026 containing and constraining behavior, and embodying \u2026 both the normative and \nthe seductive\u201d (Silverstone and Mansell 1996: 213). And crucially, \u201cthe structuring of our \nsymbolic environments which these technologies uniquely undertake is an activity which \nstill has to be managed: accepted, rejected, transcended, or transformed\u201d (Silverstone and \nMansell 1996: 219). The politics of the management of the technological innovation \nprocess were what was at stake and, arguably, continue to be so today. \n When we consider the strategies of various actors and the social consequences of \neach new generation of technology, we need to bear in mind that \n \n<Extract>these [developments] occur locally, but they are interpenetrated by \nmanifestations of the global in complex ways involving power relations which, at \nleast potentially, enable new opportunities for learning and diversity \u2026 Whether \nthese opportunities make a profound difference in people\u2019s lives and whether they \n 19 \nare understood as helpful are questions that the scholarly community must \ncontinue to assess.<\/Extract> <Source>(Mansell 2009)<\/Source> \n \n<H1>Practices and strategies in everyday life<\/H1> \nEssential to any perspective on ICT innovation that takes power and the political into \naccount is an acknowledgment of the significance of the practices and tactics of \n\u201ceveryday life.\u201d Following Certeau, investigations of innovations in ICTs need to \nexamine the new \u201cways of operating.\u201d \u201cThey need to show how these constitute the \ninnumerable practices by means of which users reappropriate the space organized by \ntechniques of sociocultural production \u2026 to bring to light the clandestine forms taken by \nthe dispersed, tactical, and make-shift creativity of groups or individuals already caught \nin the nets of \u2018discipline\u2019\u201d (Certeau 1984: xiv). In other words, they need to seek out the \nspaces of indeterminacy and to allow for potentially empowering developments instead \nof assuming either that these are inevitably present or that they are always absent. \n In addition, following Silverstone, studies of ICT diffusion need to contend with \nthe fact that \u201cthe world of globally mediated communication offers and to a degree \ndefines the terms of our participation with the other\u201d (Silverstone 2007: 27) and that \n\u201caccess to, and participation in, a global system of mediated communication is a \nsubstantive good and a precondition for full membership of society, and that the \ndistribution of such a right must be fair and just\u201d (Silverstone 2007: 147). Taking these \nconsiderations into account in assessments of ICT, and acknowledging that we require \nanalytical tools addressed to the meso- and macro-levels of investigation as well as the \nindividual agent, it is essential to conceptualize and analyze the strategic interests of \n 20 \nvarious groups. This can be achieved in many different ways, one of which is to consider \nhow the interests of institutional actors are being articulated through time. We (Mansell \nand Steinmueller 2000) developed, for example, an analytical framework focusing on the \nchanging relations of incumbency, insurgency, and virtual community status in the \ncontext of ICT innovation.  \n Absent from that analytical framework was a consideration of whether an \nintensely networked world yields some form of \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d (Sunstein 2006; \nSurowiecki 2004; Tovey 2008) and a new potential for the expression of individual \ncreativity, yielding the kinds of empowerment envisaged by many forecasters. There is \nno doubt that big changes are underway as the information society extends to support \nmultiple identities, where individuals engage in switching identities, undertaking, using, \nand dropping roles at various times. These practices are, arguably, as old as human \ncivilization, but the new networked practices of everyday life are creating a changed \nsocial environment as a result of the scale and scope of today\u2019s global networks (Rab \n2006). As a result, there are many signs of a blurring of boundaries between formerly \ndistinct realms of social activity. These changes are visible in the realms of commerce, \nentertainment, and learning; in the personalization and professionalization of services; in \nthe conflation of private and public life; and in the growing emphasis on the feasibility of \nusing electronic services to support civic participation and democracy. \n \n<H1>Renewal of contestation<\/H1> \nThere is contestation over the meaning and social significance of these developments and \nlittle sign of consensus over whether networked individualism or collective action is the \n 21 \npredominant trend, much less as to whether the latter should be privileged over the \nformer. There is even less agreement about whether access to increasingly vast resources \nof information is consistent with the availability of reliable or useful information, and, \nindeed, whether the fact that many individuals can become active communicators means \nthat citizens can also be co-decision makers about the parameters within which they live \ntheir lives. Still to be investigated more deeply is whether it is important to distinguish \nbetween \u201creal\u201d and \u201cunreal\u201d intimacy; whether intensive networking favors heightened \nsociability or enhances anti-social behaviors; whether the new forms of mediation favor \nsocial isolation or inclusion; and whether \u201calways on\u201d networking yields a work\u2013life \nbalance that is empowering or increasingly stressful. The mediated matrices of everyday \nlife are raising issues about trust, privacy, identity management, and safety. At the \nindividual level there are divergent views, from the complacent to the defeatist, in these \nareas, as suggested by this quotation:  \n \n<Extract>Me, myself and I: manage online identity more safely. A scrap of information \nhere, a little detail there \u2026 the web is safe if you guard what personal and financial \ninformation you provide. Or is it? Identity theft and cyber-spying are on the rise, and \nkeeping track of what you reveal is nigh on impossible. <\/Extract><Source>(Cordis 2010 \nn.p.)<\/Source>  \n \nFrom spammers and phishing to hoaxes, hackers, spyware, adware, and Trojan Horse \nviruses, we are finding that surfing the web is becoming synonymous with new forms of \nsurveillance and that security and actual and perceived risk are becoming intertwined in \n 22 \nnew ways. Surveillance brings new threats to civil liberties even though it is widely \naccepted by some citizens. And despite the fact that the growing use of databases on \nchildren, migrants, and \u201cpre-criminals\u201d is contested, it is growing nonetheless in the UK \nand elsewhere in Europe (Anderson et al. 2007). Improvements in data management are \noccurring relatively slowly compared with the proliferation of databases containing \npersonal information. Although the political considerations and civil rights issues \nassociated with the use of \u201csocial sorting software\u201d are becoming better documented \n(Braman 2010; Gandy Jr. 2009; Lyon 2007), the increasingly pervasive use of these \ntechniques is reinforcing social inequalities. This is inconsistent with the simple claims \nabout the relationship between networking and citizen empowerment. \n These developments suggest the importance of digital literacies, broadly \nunderstood to embrace cognizance of the uses to which networking is being put and a \ncapacity to make judgments about whether or not these practices are justified or should \nbe resisted through individual and collective means. Also needed is a better \nunderstanding of the respective roles of family and peers in inculcating these literacies, \nwhat educational practices should be encouraged, and whether literacies should be seen \nas political issues or left to the resolution of the market. There is, of course, also the issue \nthat even if citizens can speak about these kinds of issues in a knowledgeable way, it is \nnot at all clear where they will find the deliberative forums in which their voices might be \nheard (Dahlberg 2001; Dahlgren 2005; Lievrouw 2010).  \n \n<H1>Conclusion<\/H1> \n 23 \nThere are many social dilemmas confronting all those who conduct their lives in \nmediated spaces alongside their material lives. We do not know whether, for example, the \npredominant trends are towards social contacts widening or narrowing, enhanced \ndemocratization or the concentration of power, enhanced individuality and personality \nmultiples, a new form of mass society in which \u201cmass self-communication\u201d comes to \npredominate (Castells 2009, 2007), or greater user creativity and empowerment or the \nnext generation of the digital divide (Hargittai 2002; Jung 2008; Zhao and Elesh 2006). \n Technologically mediated societies have been with us for centuries, but the most \nrecent changes are associated with codifying and manipulating information. In this \ncontext, we know that \u2018assembling the \u201ctools\u201d is only part of the task \u2026 Measures must \nbe taken to assemble the human capabilities and related technologies to make the best use \nof the new opportunities offered by ICTs\u2019 (Mansell and Wehn 1998: 261), yet it appears \nthat there is resistance to learning this lesson, just as there was historically. This is \nbecause decisions in this area are highly political and necessarily judgmental. What \ncriteria, for instance, should guide management of our non-place-based identities? What \nhuman rights and responsibilities should be associated with the emerging networked \norder? Once we acknowledge the political, we confront the fact that all choices made \nconcerning the mediated environment of the twenty-first century are political as well.  \n Yet the headline digital narrative continues to suggest that ICTs mean the end of \nhierarchy, the ascendance of an open commons for information, and the decline of \nbarriers to information sharing. If this is so, then economic and political power may shift \nirreversibly to individual information producers and citizens. Acquiring the new literacies \nmay be relatively less problematic for each generational cohort (Williamson et al. 2010), \n 24 \nand the active mass media audience may be in the process of becoming the new media \ncontent or information producer. There is no doubt that there is a proliferation of blogs, \nSMSs, email lists, and decentralized networks. As more citizens become information \nproducers there is a tendency to assume that the standard diffusion model will run its \ncourse so that all citizens eventually will be embraced by an inclusive information age, \nand included in ways that are to their advantage.  \n These universalistic claims appear to take little or no account of the diversity of \nsocieties. If diversity is acknowledged and valued then it follows that it is unlikely that \nthere will be a universal information society. Rather there are diverse mediated \nenvironments just as there were diverse instantiations of the industrial age (Mansell 2009, \n2002). It is a fallacy to think in terms of a \u201ccatch-up\u201d process where digital divides are \nclosed, yielding global and local harmony within the information society. Therefore, we \nneed to examine specifically who is being included, on what terms, and, crucially, who is \nnot and what means we have to alter this condition.  \n A close investigation of whose narratives about ICTs and information societies or \nknowledge societies are being validated is required. We need investigations of who is \nparticipating in decisions about ICT design and deployment with a view to understanding \ntheir values so as to reveal the contested political foundations of these developments. \nConsidering these issues in historical and political perspective is very likely to show that, \nwhatever the shifts in power in society accompanying the diffusion of ICTs are, they are \npartial and temporary. They do, however, provide us with focal points for a material \ninvestigation of the contested practices and values that are embedded within our new \nmediated forms and structures of control. \n 25 \n \n<H1>Notes<\/H1> \n1.

(2007). \n2. For historical studies, see Braudel (1984), Castells (1996), Freeman and Soete (1997), \nInnis (1950, 1951), Marvin (1988), and Mattelart (1996\/2000). \n3. My purpose is not to set out that body of work in this chapter. The interested reader \nmight start with Castells (2009).  \n4. For research in this tradition see, for example, Attewell (1992), Brancheau and \nWetherbe (1990), Carter et al.
