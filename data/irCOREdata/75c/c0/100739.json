Long-standing questions are \u201cWhere are the proton\nand neutron drip lines situated?\u201d and \u201cHow does the nuclear\nforce depend on varying proton-to-neutron ratios?\u201d [1]. These\nissues can be addressed by investigating long isotopic chains:\nThe magic Z = 28 nickel chain covers four potentially doubly-\nmagic nuclides, namely, with N = 20, N = 28, N = 40, and\nN = 50. Indeed, 48Ni is found to denote the proton dripline [2],\nwhile measurements on 78Ni provide crucial information on\nthe astrophysical rapid neutron capture process [3]. As with\n68Ni [4], the self-conjugate N = Z nucleus 56Ni shows distinct\nfeatures of a soft doubly-magic core, becoming strongly\ndeformed at modest excitation energies and angular momenta.\nFurthermore, a rotational state at \u223c10 MeV excitation energy\nin 56Ni revealed a fast, discrete proton decay branch [5,6].\nAnother evergreen of nuclear structure studies along the\nN = Z line is isospin symmetry or, more precisely, the\nbreaking of isospin symmetry due to the Coulomb force as well\nas, possibly, some components of the strong nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction [7]. Here, the so-called \u201cJ = 2 anomaly\u201d must\nbe mentioned: It relates to unusual mirror energy differences\n(MED) in excited states, the wave functions of which are\nthought to be dominated by spin J = 2, isospin T = 1\ncouplings [7\u20139]. During the past decade, the prime region for\nsuch investigations has been the rather well-confined N = 3,\n*Present address: FZ Karlsruhe\n\u2020Present address: RIKEN\n\u201cfp shell\u201d reaching from 40Ca toward 80Zr while passing 56Ni.\nRelated work has been summarized recently [10\u201312].\nThis rapid communication provides new experimental\nresults on the Tz = \u22121 nucleus 54Ni, hence addressing both the\ndripline and the isospin symmetry breaking aspects indicated\nabove. The existence of an isomeric 10+ state in 54Fe has\nbeen known for decades [13], and thus an isobaric analog\nstate is expected to exist in 54Ni. Besides basic studies of\nMED, its observation bears the potential of isospin symmetry\nstudies of electromagnetic moments and decay properties, for\nexample, an independent check on the recently established\nisoscalar and isovector polarization charges near 56Ni [14] and\na possible extension to E4 transitions. Previous knowledge\non 54Ni includes the yrast 6+ \u2192 4+ \u2192 2+ \u2192 0+ ground-\nstate cascade established via in-beam \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy [9]\nand measurements of B(E2; 2+ \u2192 0+) = 122(24) e2fm4 by\nrelativistic Coulomb excitation experiments [15,16].\nWithin the Rare Isotope Spectroscopic INvestigations at\nGSI (RISING) campaign, the nuclei of interest were produced\nby fragmentation of a 58Ni primary beam at 550 MeV\/u on\na 1 g\/cm2 9Be target. Subsequently, the reaction products\nwere selected by means of a B\u03c1 \u2212 \u0005E \u2212 B\u03c1 technique in the\nFRagment Separator (FRS) [17]. The ion-by-ion identification\nin terms of mass, A, and proton number, Z, of each transmitted\nion is performed uniquely with a suite of scintillator and\nionization detectors placed at the intermediate and final focus\nof the FRS. The identified secondary ions, namely, 51,52Fe\n(0.4%), 52,53Co (15.5 and 21.3%), and 53,54,55Ni (1.4, 58.6,\nand 2.8%), finally came to rest in a 4 mm thick Be plate after\nsome 350 ns flight time through the FRS.

Part (a) shows a spectrum\nrequiring a complete ion identification. It was\ntaken between 0.2 and 0.8 \u00b5s after implantation.\nImplantation-correlated background radiation is\nremoved with correspondingly selected spectra\nof other implanted ions, namely, 53,55Ni and\n52,53Co, which do not show any delayed \u03b3 rays\nin this time range. Room and long-lived \u03b2-decay\nbackground is subtracted with a spectrum taken\nbetween 19.0 and 19.6 \u00b5s after implantation.\nParts (b) and (c) provide spectra in coincidence\nwith the known yrast cascade [9] in 54Ni and the\nnew 3386-keV, 10+ \u2192 6+ E4 transition.\nsurrounded by fifteen high-efficiency CLUSTER Ge detectors\n[18] for \u03b3 -ray detection. Each ion arriving at the final focus\nstarted a clock and subsequent \u03b3 decays from isomeric states\nwere recorded for 20 \u00b5s before the data acquisition system\nreset itself. More details on the experiment and the RISING\nsetup can be found in Refs. [19,20].\nDuring 60 h of beam time and employing a very restrictive\nand stringent heavy-ion identification procedure on the FRS\ndata, some 4.8 million implanted 54Ni nuclei have been\nidentified. Figure 1(a) provides the associated time-correlated\nand background subtracted \u03b3 -ray spectrum. It reveals seven\ndelayed \u03b3 -ray transitions at 146.1(2), 451.0(3), 1227.4(4),\n1327.3(4), 1392.3(4), 3240.7(7), and 3386.2(9) keV. The latter\nis highlighted in the inset, and the single-escape line of the\n3241 keV transition is also present. The 451-, 1227-, and\n1392-keV lines are known to belong to 54Ni [9]. The 146-\nand 3241-keV transitions are very similar in energy to the\n10+ \u2192 8+ \u2192 6+ sequence in the mirror nucleus 54Fe, and the\n3386-keV line represents a parallel 5.1(11)% 10+ \u2192 6+E4\nbranch. The branching ratio is corrected for possible pileup\nof the 146- and 3241-keV transitions in the same Ge detector.\nThis scheme is underpinned by the \u03b3 -ray spectra in Figs. 1(b)\nand 1(c), which are based on delayed \u03b3 \u03b3 coincidences. Both\nthe time range and the FRS identification scheme are somewhat\nrelaxed to allow for increased statistics. The spectrum in\nFig. 1(b) is taken in prompt coincidence with the known\nground-state cascade and confirms the placement of the 146-,\n3241-, and 3386-keV transitions on top of it. Figure 1(c) is the\ncoincidence spectrum of the weak 3386-keV line, proving that\nit lies parallel to the 146- to 3241-keV cascade.\nThe peak at 1327 keV, which is clearly seen in Fig. 1(a), is\nabsent in both Figs. 1(b) and 1(c); i.e., it is not in coincidence\nwith any other \u03b3 -ray transition associated with the decay\nof the presumed 10+ isomer in 54Ni. Nevertheless, within\nuncertainties the 1327-keV line exhibits the same half-life as\nthe 54Ni transitions. This is shown in Fig. 2, which provides\nthree scaled decay curves of the previously reported transitions\nin 54Ni (top), the new high-energetic ones (middle), and the\n1327-keV line (bottom). The conclusion is that the single \u03b3\nray at 1327 keV must have the same isomeric origin as the\nother six transitions. Because 1327 keV matches exactly the\nprompt 9\/2\u2212 \u2192 7\/2\u2212 ground-state \u03b3 transition in 53Co [8], a\ndiscrete 1.28(5)-MeV, \u0002 = 5 proton decay from the isomeric\n10+ state in 54Ni into the excited 9\/2\u2212 state in the daughter\n53Co is inferred. This marks the first evidence for discrete\nproton emission competing with \u03b3 radiation following a\nprojectile fragmentation reaction. The evidence is indirect,\nbecause both the present setup and the implantation depth\nof 54Ni ions in the stopper together with the short half-life\nprevent a direct measurement of the protons. Historically, this\nobservation takes proton decay studies back to its roots, as\nthe first reported proton decay ever was observed from the\nlong-lived 19\/2\u2212 high-spin state in 53Co [21,22]. The existence\nof the present type of discrete proton decay opens a plethora\nof subsequent, unprecedented investigations: isospin aspects\nof static moments and, ultimately, proton angular distributions\nfrom an aligned state with known quadrupole moment.\nThe lifetime of the 10+ state in 54Ni averages to T1\/2 =\n152(4) ns.

To account for other monopole related shifts of\nsingle-particle energy levels the prescription of Ref. [11] (VCr)\nis followed. Finally, charge-asymmetric components of the\nstrong nucleon-nucleon interaction are included. A repulsive\n100-keV term, VBM\u22122, was introduced for the 1f7\/22, J = 2\ntwo-proton matrix element by Zuker et al. [6] to account for\nan anomalous MED value of the 2+ states in the A = 42\nmirror pair. The use of VBM\u22122 has been shown to improve\nthe MED description of nuclei throughout the entire 1f7\/2\nshell [8\u201310]. Electromagnetic decay properties are calculated\nwith the E2 effective charges of epeff = 1.15 and eneff = 0.80\nderived in Ref. [14], while for B(E4) strengths the values [12]\ne\np\neff = 1.5 and eneff = 0.5 are used as a starting point [30].\nFigure 3 compares the energy levels of the KB3G inter-\naction with the experimental cascade in 54Ni (and 54Fe). The\nknown 1f7\/2\u22122 dominated 0+, 2+, 4+, 6+ yrast cascade [9] is\nwell described. However, some deficiencies of the interaction\nbecome apparent for the core-excited 8+ and 10+ states: the\nenergy gap is predicted somewhat too large, and the two states\nare inverted, though still within the typical predictive power\nfor level energies [10,12].\nFigure 4 provides the experimental MED diagram for the\nTz = \u00b11, A = 54 system (black dots) and the predictions\nusing the KB3G interaction. Though differing in details,\npredictions using the GXPF1A interaction do yield essentially\nthe same picture. The calculations without any nuclear isospin\nbreaking component (dotted line) fail to reproduce the MED of\nthe 2+ states. While this is expected [7,9], also the MED values\nof the 8+ and 10+ states are being missed. In turn, the MED\npredictions including VBM\u22122 (solid black line) are in nearly\nperfect agreement with the experimental values; i.e., they\naccount for the above-mentioned MED discrepancies at both\nspin I = 2 and spins I = 8 and I = 10. A similar effect on\nMED values might be achieved by instead using an attractive\n100-keV term,VBM\u22120, for the 1f7\/22, J = 0 two-proton matrix\nelement. In fact, the calculation using the VBM\u22120 term (solid\ngrey line) also improves on the MED of the 2+, 8+, and 10+\nstates. However, the predictions for the intermediate spin I = 4\n021301-3\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nD. RUDOLPH et al.

(Color online) Mirror energy difference, Ex(54Ni) \u2212\nEx(54Fe), as a function of spin. Solid circles denote the experimental\nvalues. The dotted line accounts only for Coulomb related isospin\nbreaking terms [11], while the solid black and grey lines include the\nVBM\u22122 [7] and VBM\u22120 terms, based on the KB3G interaction. The\nlong- and short-dashed lines provide the difference between 54Fe and\n54Ni of T = 1 proton pairs, \u0005pp , coupled to either J = 2 or J = 0,\nrespectively.\nand I = 6 states are significantly worsened; i.e., VBM\u22120 seems\nto be able to improve the MED predictions locally, while\nVBM\u22122 appears to act globally.\nTo study the influence of these two nuclear isospin\nbreaking terms in some more detail, Fig. 4 provides also\nthe difference of the number of two-proton J = 0 pairs [thin\ndashed lines, \u0005pp(J = 0)] and J = 2 pairs [thin long-dashed\nlines, \u0005pp(J = 2)] between 54Fe and 54Ni as a function of\nangular momentum. In the case of \u0005pp(J = 0), the curve\ntrivially drops exactly once between I = 0 and I = 2, but\nthen remains essentially constant. On the contrary, \u0005pp(J = 2)\npeaks at I = 2 and once more at I = 8 and I = 10, which is\nnicely correlated with the respective global reproduction of the\nexperimental MED with shell-model calculations accounting\nfor the VBM\u22122 term. This presents the first clear evidence that\nthe non-Coulomb isospin-breaking component has its origin\nin the J = 2 coupling, rather than J = 0, of 1f7\/2 particles.\nExperimental and predicted electromagnetic decay proper-\nties are compared in Table I. Excellent agreement is achieved,\nwith two exceptions: the B(E4) strength in 54Fe and its related\nE4 branch, and the lifetime of the isomer itself in 54Ni. The\nlatter discrepancy becomes more obvious when comparing\nthe ratios of the lifetime predictions, R = 1.06, with the\nexperimental values, R = 1.53(5). This rather significant\nmismatch could be cured by an additional \u223c25% proton\nbranch into the ground state of 53Co, to which the present\nexperiment is insensitive. The right-most column of Table I\nincludes this correction. Indeed, simple WKB estimates\nprovide similar tunneling probabilities for a 1.28-MeV, \u0002 = 5\nproton into the 9\/2\u2212 state in 53Co and a 2.61-MeV, \u0002 = 7\nproton into the ground state of 53Co [31]; the structural\nhindrance factors are on the order of 106, which remain to\nbe explained by tiny 1h11\/2 or 1j13\/2 proton partitions in the\nwave function of the 10+ state in 54Ni.\nThe possible existence of a second proton branch prevents\na dedicated analysis of E4 polarization charges along the\nscheme developed in Ref. [14], because an absolute number\nfor the 10+ \u2192 6+ transition in 54Ni is missing. Nevertheless,\nusing the extremes the ratio of the B(E4) values in 54Fe and\n54Ni is limited to R \u223c 0.10\u20130.25, which requires negative\nisovector E4 polarization charges. The best agreement for the\n(corrected) experimental data is achieved with eeff,p(E4) \u223c\n1.35 and eeff,n(E4) \u223c 0.25.\nIn summary, the 10+ mirror isomer in 54Ni has been\nidentified. Its electromagnetic decay characteristics provide\nnew constraints on large-scale fp shell-model calculations\nin conjunction with isospin symmetry. It is shown that the\nMED values for the 2+, 8+, and 10+ states can be associated\nwith the isospin symmetry breaking J = 2, T = 1 interaction.\nEvidence is presented for a distinct direct proton decay\nbranch into the excited 9\/2\u2212 state in 53Co, and a significant\ndiscrepancy of the experimental and predicted half-life of the\nisomer points to an additional proton branch into the ground\nstate of 53Co.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the outstanding work\nof the GSI accelerator and ion-source crews in providing the\nexperiment with the envisaged high beam intensities.
