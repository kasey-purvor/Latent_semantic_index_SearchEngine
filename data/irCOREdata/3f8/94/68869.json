The switching of a graphene-based transistor\nwould be improved by opening an energy gap between\nthe conduction and valence bands, possibly by lateral\nconfinement of electrons in etched structures [5, 6, 7, 8]\nor by employing gates to induce interlayer asymmetry in\nbilayer graphene [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Recently,\nexperimental attention has turned towards the properties\nof ABA-stacked trilayer graphene, Fig. 1(a), [17, 18, 19].\nTheory suggests that the bands are of two separate types\n[10, 11, 20, 21, 22, 23]: two almost-linear bands rem-\niniscent of the bands in monolayer graphene and four\nparabolic bands similar to those in bilayer graphene.\nThis raises the expectation that the electronic behavior\nwill display no new features as compared to monolayer\nor bilayer graphene.\nIn this paper, we show theoretically that the response\nof ABA-stacked trilayer graphene to external gate poten-\ntials is in fact qualitatively different from that in mono-\nor bi-layer graphene. We use an effective-mass model to\nself-consistently determine the electronic band structure\nand we show how the breaking of mirror reflection sym-\nmetry by interlayer asymmetry causes hybridization of\nthe linear and parabolic bands. Rather than opening a\ngap, as in bilayer graphene [9], this leaves two bands near\nzero energy which support chiral quasiparticles. Employ-\ning a self-consistent Born approximation to estimate the\nminimal conductivity as a function of interlayer asym-\nmetry, we find that the conductivity generally increases\nas asymmetry increases, in sharp contrast with bilayer\ngraphene as illustrated in Fig. 1(b).\nA description of trilayer graphene in the presence of ex-\nternal gates must include two parameters that take into\naccount differences in the potentials V1, V2, and V3 of the\nthree layers. The first, \u22061 = \u2212e(V1 \u2212 V3)\/2, describes\nthe average energy difference between each adjacent layer\n[10, 11, 23], while the second, \u22062 = \u2212e(V1\u22122V2+V3)\/6,\ndescribes the difference between the energy of the cen-\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic of the ABA-stacked trilayer lattice\ncontaining six sites in the unit cell, A (white circles) and B\n(black circles) on each layer, showing the Slonczewski-Weiss-\nMcClure parameterization [24] of relevant couplings \u03b30 to \u03b35.\n(b) The conductivity versus external asymmetry \u2206\n(ext)\n1 , calcu-\nlated for trilayer and bilayer graphene using the self-consistent\nBorn approximation and the band model including \u03b30 and \u03b31.\n(c) Schematic of trilayer graphene (three thin black lines at\nx = \u2212d, 0, d) with top and bottom gates (thick black lines at\nx = Lt,\u2212Lb) separated from the trilayer by dielectric media\n(gray shaded areas).\ntral layer and the average of the outer layers. We model\nthe effect of back and top gates by considering the tri-\nlayer as three conducting parallel plates as illustrated in\nFig. 1(c), with respective electron densities n1, n2 and n3,\nlocated at x = \u2212d, 0, and +d, respectively, where d is\nthe interlayer spacing, and the permittivity of the trilayer\ninterlayer spaces (without the screening effect of pi-band\n2electrons of the trilayer graphene) is \u03b5r. The back (top)\ngate at x = \u2212Lb (x = +Lt), held at potential Vb (Vt), is\nseparated from the trilayer by a dielectric medium with\nrelative permittivity \u03b5b (\u03b5t). Using elementary electro-\nstatics, we relate the external gate potentials, the elec-\ntron densities on the layers, and the interlayer asymmetry\nparameters:\n\u03b5bVb\nLb\n+\n\u03b5tVt\nLt\n= e (n1 + n2 + n3) , (1)\n\u22061 =\n\u03b5tVt\nLt\n\u2212 \u03b5bVb\nLb\n+\ne2d\n2\u03b5r\n(n1 \u2212 n3), (2)\n\u22062 = \u2212e\n2d\n6\u03b5r\nn2 . (3)\nIn the following, we use the total electron density ntot =\nn1+n2+n3 and \u2206\n(ext)\n1 as external parameters instead of\nVt and Vg, where \u2206\n(ext)\n1 = \u03b5tVt\/Lt\u2212 \u03b5bVb\/Lb is the value\nof \u22061 that would occur if screening were negligible.\nWe model ABA-stacked trilayer graphene as three cou-\npled honeycomb lattices including pairs of inequivalent\nsites {A1, B1}, {A2, B2}, and {A3, B3} in the bottom,\ncenter, and top layers, respectively. The layers are ar-\nranged according to Bernal (A-B) stacking [24], Fig. 1(a),\nsuch that sites B1, A2, and B3 lie directly above or\nbelow each other. We employ an effective-mass model\nadopting the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure parameteriza-\ntion, [24] where each parameter is related to relevant\ncoupling in the tight-binding model: \u03b30 describes nearest-\nneighbor (Ai-Bi for i = {1, 2, 3}) coupling within each\nlayer, \u03b31 describes strong nearest-layer coupling between\nsites (B1-A2 and A2-B3) that lie directly above or below\neach other, \u03b33 (\u03b34) describes weaker nearest-layer cou-\npling between sites A1-B2 and B2-A3 (A1-A2, B1-B2,\nA2-A3, and B2-B3). With only these couplings, there\nwould be a degeneracy point at each of two inequivalent\ncorners, K\u00b1, of the hexagonal Brillouin zone [25] but\nthis degeneracy is broken by next-nearest-layer coupling\n\u03b32 (between A1 and A3), \u03b35 (between B1 and B3) and \u03b4,\nwhich is the on-site energy difference between A1, B2, A3\nand B1, A2, B3. Note that the parameter \u2206 often used\nin models of three-dimensional (3D) graphite is given by\n\u2206 = \u03b4 + \u03b32 \u2212 \u03b35. In trilayer graphene, the presence of\na surface may induce a modification in the value of the\nband parameters as compared to those in bulk graphite.\nHere, parameter \u22062 = \u2212e(V1 \u2212 2V2 + V3)\/6, takes into\naccount a possible difference between the energy of the\ncentral layer and the average of the outer layers, and,\nin general, surface effects may contribute to a non-zero\nvalue of \u22062.\nIn a basis with components \u03c8A1, \u03c8B1, \u03c8A2 , \u03c8B2, \u03c8A3,\n\u03c8B3, the ABA-stacked trilayer Hamiltonian is\nH\u02dc =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nU1 vpi\n\u2020 \u2212v4pi\u2020 v3pi \u03b32\/2 0\nvpi U1 + \u03b4 \u03b31 \u2212v4pi\u2020 0 \u03b35\/2\n\u2212v4pi \u03b31 U2 + \u03b4 vpi\u2020 \u2212v4pi \u03b31\nv3pi\n\u2020 \u2212v4pi vpi U2 v3pi\u2020 \u2212v4pi\n\u03b32\/2 0 \u2212v4pi\u2020 v3pi U3 vpi\u2020\n0 \u03b35\/2 \u03b31 \u2212v4pi\u2020 vpi U3 + \u03b4\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n,(4)\nwhere operator pi = \u03bepx + ipy is related to the in-\nplane momentum p = (px, py) [25], effective velocities\nare v = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b30\/~, v3 = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b33\/~, and v4 =\n(\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b34\/~, Ui = \u2212eVi, and \u03be = \u00b11 is the valley in-\ndex K\u00b1. Exploiting mirror reflection symmetry of the\nlattice in the plane of its central layer, Fig. 1(a), we per-\nform a unitary transformation to a basis consisting of\nlinear combinations of the atomic orbitals [22], namely\n[\u03c8A1\u2212\u03c8A3]\/\n\u221a\n2, [\u03c8B1\u2212\u03c8B3]\/\n\u221a\n2, [\u03c8A1+\u03c8A3]\/\n\u221a\n2, \u03c8B2,\n\u03c8A2, [\u03c8B1 + \u03c8B3]\/\n\u221a\n2:\nH =\n(\nHm D\nDT Hb\n)\n, D =\n(\n\u22061 0 0 0\n0 0 0 \u22061\n)\n, (5)\nHm =\n(\n\u22062 \u2212 \u03b32\/2 vpi\u2020\nvpi \u22062 \u2212 \u03b35\/2 + \u03b4\n)\n, (6)\nHb =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u22062 + \u03b32\/2\n\u221a\n2v3pi \u2212\n\u221a\n2v4pi\n\u2020 vpi\u2020\u221a\n2v3pi\n\u2020 \u22122\u22062 vpi \u2212\n\u221a\n2v4pi\n\u2212\u221a2v4pi vpi\u2020 \u22122\u22062 + \u03b4\n\u221a\n2\u03b31\nvpi \u2212\u221a2v4pi\u2020\n\u221a\n2\u03b31 \u22062 + \u03b35\/2 + \u03b4\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,(7)\nwhere the average on-site energy [U1 + U2 + U3]\/3 has\nbeen set equal to zero. The Hamiltonian H has a 2 \u00d7 2\nblockHm and a 4\u00d74 blockHb on the diagonal, connected\nby a simple off-diagonal block D. Block Hm is similar to\nthe Dirac-type Hamiltonian of monolayer graphene and it\ncontributes two bands near zero energy whereas block Hb\nis reminiscent of the Hamiltonian of bilayer graphene [9],\nexcept that terms proportional to \u03b31, \u03b33, and \u03b34 appear\nwith a factor\n\u221a\n2 [22]. The latter gives two bands split\naway from zero by energy \u00b1\u221a2\u03b31 and two bands near\nzero energy.\nThe monolayer-like block has wave functions possess-\ning odd mirror reflection symmetry, while the wave func-\ntions of the bilayer part are even. Since the interlayer\nasymmetry \u22061 is the only parameter that breaks mir-\nror reflection symmetry, its role is qualitatively different\nfrom the other parameters, coupling the monolayer-like\nand bilayer-like blocks. For large \u22061, two of the low-\nenergy bands, related to orbitals [\u03c8A1 \u2212 \u03c8A3]\/\n\u221a\n2 and\n[\u03c8A1+\u03c8A3]\/\n\u221a\n2, split away from zero by energy \u000f \u2248 \u00b1\u22061\nat the K point, leaving only two bands near zero, associ-\nated with \u03a8\u2032 =\n(\n[\u03c8B1 \u2212 \u03c8B3]\/\n\u221a\n2, \u03c8B2\n)T\n. To obtain an\napproximate Hamiltonian Heff for \u03a8\n\u2032, we denote H2 as\nthe diagonal block of Hamiltonian H corresponding to\nthese two low-energy components, H4 as the 4\u00d7 4 diago-\nnal block corresponding to the high-energy components,\nand V as the off-diagonal 2 \u00d7 4 block coupling H2 and\nH4. The Schro\u00a8dinger equation for \u03a8\n\u2032 can be expanded\nup to first order in \u03b5 as [H2 \u2212 V H\u221214 V \u2020]\u03a8\u2032 = \u03b5S\u03a8\u2032 with\nS \u2261 1 + V H\u221224 V \u2020. Then, the effective Hamiltonian for\n\u03a8 = S1\/2\u03a8\u2032 becomes Heff \u2248 S\u22121\/2[H2\u2212V H\u221214 V \u2020]S\u22121\/2.\nFor the moment, we focus on the role of \u22061 by consider-\ning \u22062 = \u03b32 = \u03b33 = \u03b34 = \u03b35 = \u03b4 = 0. For large enough\n3\u22061 (|\u03b31| \u001d |\u22061| \u001d |\u000f|), Heff is written as\nHeff \u2248\n(\n0 X\u2020\nX 0\n)\n,\nX = \u2212\u22061vpi\u221a\n2\u03b31\n(\n1\u2212 v\n2pipi\u2020\n\u220621\n)(\n1 +\nv2pipi\u2020\n\u220621\n)\u22121\/2\n.\nFor plane-wave eigenstates at zero magnetic field, pipi\u2020\nis just a number, p2. The first factor of pi = \u03bepx + ipy\nin operator X ensures that such eigenstates are chiral,\n\u03a8 =\n(\ne\u2212i\u03be\u03b8\/2,\u2213\u03beei\u03be\u03b8\/2)T \/\u221a2 with \u03b8 = tan\u22121(py\/px).\nThe expression for the eigenenergies is\n\u000f \u2248 \u00b1 vp\u221a\n2\u03b31\n(\nv2p2 \u2212\u220621\n)\u221a\nv2p2 +\u220621\n, (8)\nwhich generalizes Eq. (22) of Ref. 11, showing that there\nis a small overlap \u03b4\u000f \u223c \u220621\/\u03b31 between the two low-\nenergy bands that cross at p = \u22061\/v [11]. This behavior\ncontrasts with that of bilayer graphene, where interlayer\nasymmetry introduces an energy gap between the low-\nenergy bands [9] and tends to suppress the chiral nature\nof quasiparticles in them.\nFor given parameters \u22061, \u22062 and fixed total density\nntot, the electron densities n1, n2 and n3 may be deter-\nmined by summing (|\u03c8Ai|2+|\u03c8Bi|2)\/L2 over the occupied\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian (4). However, such densi-\nties are also related to \u22061 and \u22062 through Eqs. (2) and\n(3), so it is necessary to solve this set of equations self-\nconsistently in order to obtain values of \u22061 and \u22062 for\ngiven external parameters ntot and \u2206\n(ext)\n1 . A similar pro-\ncedure has been applied to bilayer graphene [12, 13, 14]\nand to many-layered graphene [26]. This Hartree approx-\nimation neglects effects including exchange interaction,\npossible deformation of atomic orbitals in the applied\nelectric field, and the role of \u03c3 orbitals in screening, but\ncomparison with density functional theory [13] in bilayers\nsuggests that it is qualitatively accurate.\nFor \u03b32 = \u03b33 = \u03b34 = \u03b35 = \u03b4 = 0 with ntot = 0, it\nis possible to perform a linear response calculation for\ninfinitely small \u2206\n(ext)\n1 . Within the first order in \u22061, we\nhave n1 \u2212 n3 = \u03a0\u22061 with\n\u03a0 =\n\u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\nf(\u03b5\u03b1)\n2|\u3008\u03b1| \u2202H\u2202\u22061 |\u03b1\u2032\u3009|2\n\u03b5\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1\u2032 = \u2212\ngvgs\n2\n\u221a\n2pi\n\u03b31\n(~v)2\n, (9)\nwhere gs = gv = 2 are the spin and valley degeneracies,\nrespectively, |\u03b1\u3009 and \u03b5\u03b1 are the eigenstates and eigenen-\nergy of the Hamiltonian without \u22061 or \u22062, f(\u03b5) is the\nFermi distribution function with zero Fermi energy. Us-\ning Eqs. (2) and (3), we obtain the self-consistent solution\n\u22061 = \u2206\n(ext)\n1 \/\u03b5eff with \u03b5eff = 1\u2212 (e2d\/2\u03b5r)\u03a0. \u22062 is never\ninduced. Typical parameters v = 1.0\u00d7106 m\/s, \u03b31 = 0.4\neV, d = 0.334 nm, \u03b5r = 2 give 1\/\u03b5eff \u2248 0.61.\nTo determine the band structure taking into account\nall the parameters, we find \u22061 and \u22062 self-consistently\nby employing an iterative numerical approach. We first\nFIG. 2: Self-consistently calculated band structures in tri-\nlayer graphene near the K point, with ntot = 0. Left plots\nare for the model including only \u03b30 and \u03b31, with (a) no\nasymmetry \u2206\n(ext)\n1 = 0 and (b) finite external asymmetry\n\u2206\n(ext)\n1 = 0.5\u03b31. Right plots are for the full parameter model\nincluding \u03b3i (i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 5), \u03b4, with (c) \u2206\n(ext)\n1 = 0 and (d)\n0.5\u03b31. Dashed and solid curves represent \u03b8 = 0 and pi\/6. The\nself-consistently calculated value of \u22061 is shown in the lower\nside of each plot. The thin horizontal line shows the Fermi\nenergy.\nuse \u22061 = \u2206\n(ext)\n1 and \u22062 = 0 as initial values in the\nHamiltonian Eq. (4) and determine the Fermi energy so\nthat the total density is equal to ntot. Then we calculate\nni (i = 1, 2, 3) from the occupied eigenstates, which give\na new set of \u22061 and \u22062 through Eqs. (2) and (3). We\niterate this process until \u22061 and \u22062 converge.\nFigure 2 (a) and (c) show the self-consistent band\nstructures at zero external field \u2206(ext) = 0 and zero\ndoping ntot = 0. To illustrate the role of the extra\nband parameters we compare (a) the simple model in-\ncluding only \u03b30, \u03b31 and (c) the full-parameter model with\n\u03b32 = \u22120.05\u03b31, \u03b35 = 0.1\u03b31, \u03b4 = 0.125\u03b31, v3(\u221d \u03b33) = 0.1v\nand v4(\u221d \u03b34) = 0.014v (typical values quoted for bulk\ngraphite [24]). The plots show the vicinity of zero energy,\ncovering the monolayer-like band and the lower branches\nof the bilayer-like band. In (c), we see that \u03b32, \u03b35 and\n\u03b4 shift the center of the monolayer-like band upward in\nenergy relatively to the bilayer-like band. Also, the trig-\nonal warping effect due to \u03b33 is observed as a difference\nbetween \u03b8 = tan\u22121(py\/px) = 0 and pi\/6 [9]. Figures 2(b)\nand 2(d) display the corresponding plots in the presence\nof a finite external field \u2206\n(ext)\n1 = 0.5\u03b31. The values of \u22061\ndetermined self-consistently are shown in the lower side\nof each plot. In every case the screening ratio \u22061\/\u2206\n(ext)\n1\nis about 0.6, which is close to the linear response theory.\nFor Fig. 2 (b), where only \u03b30 and \u03b31 are included, there\nis a small overlap at zero energy described by Eq. (8). In\n4FIG. 3: (a),(c) Density of states and (b),(d) conductivity at\nntot = 0 as functions of \u2206\n(ext)\n1 for the model including only\n\u03b30 and \u03b31 (left) and the full parameter model (right). Solid,\ndotted, and dashed lines are for progressively larger disorder\nstrengths.\nthe full parameter model (d), there is a similar amount\nof band overlap while the exact magnitude of momentum\nat the crossing point vp \u223c \u22061 varies with angle \u03b8 in a\ntrigonal manner, and there is a tiny gap at those crossing\npoints. In (d), the self-consistent calculations yield tiny\n\u22062 < 0.01\u03b31 due to non-zero \u03b32, \u03b35 and \u03b4.\nFor each band structure we estimate the density of\nstates (DOS) and conductivity using the self-consistent\nBorn approximation [27, 28]. We assume that the scat-\nterers are on-site potentials localized on each layer, which\nis modeled by V (r) =\n\u2211\nm=1,2,3\n\u2211\ni ui\u03b4(r\u2212ri)P\u02c6 (m) where\nui and ri = (xi, yi) are the amplitude and the two-\ndimensional position of the i-th scatterer, respectively,\nand P\u02c6 (m) is the projection operator onto the m-th layer.\nWe neglect inter-valley scattering between K\u00b1. The dis-\norder strength is characterized byW = nimpu\n2\/(4pi~2v2)\n[27] where nimp is the total number of scatterers over all\nthe layers, and u = \u3008u2i \u3009. For the model with only \u03b30\nand \u03b31, the energy scale for the level broadening at zero\nenergy is given by \u0393 \u223c (pi\/\u221a2)W\u03b31. Following Ref. 27,\nwe compute the self-energy and the vertex corrections\nfor the velocity operators, and calculate the conductivity\nusing the Kubo formula.\nFigures 3(a) and 3(c) show the DOS as a function\nof \u2206\n(ext)\n1 at ntot = 0, for several values of the dis-\norder strength W . The left and right panels corre-\nspond to the simple model with \u03b30 and \u03b31, and the\nfull parameter model discussed previously, although the\nbehavior in each case is similar, DOS increases with\n\u2206\n(ext)\n1 . Figure 3(b),(d) are plots of the conductivity cor-\nresponding to (a),(c) respectively. The general trend is\nfor an increase of conductivity as \u2206\n(ext)\n1 increases, ex-\ncept for the vicinity of \u2206\n(ext)\n1 = 0 in panel (d). This\nmay be roughly understood by considering the relation\n\u03c3 = e2\u03c1F v\n2\nF \u03c4\/2 with velocity vF , DOS \u03c1F and relax-\nation time \u03c4 at the Fermi energy. When we assume that\nall the states on the Fermi energy are equally mixed by\ndisorder, we have \u03c4 \u221d \u03c1\u22121F , suggesting that the conduc-\ntivity is determined by v2F . The dispersion, Eq. (8), ap-\nproximates, in regions far from the origin vp \u001d |\u22061|, to\n\u000f \u2248 \u00b1(v2p2 \u2212 3\u220621\/2)\/(\n\u221a\n2\u03b31), showing that the electron\nand hole bands are pushed towards zero energy by the in-\ntroduction of \u22061. This leads to an increase in the expec-\ntation value of the band velocity in a disorder-broadened\nenergy window near \u000f = 0, and thus the conductivity at\nthe charge neutral point is enhanced.\nIn the simple \u03b30-\u03b31 model, Fig. 3(b), the conductivity\nat \u2206\n(ext)\n1 = 0 takes a universal value \u03c3 = 3gvgse\n2\/(2pi2~)\nindependently of W . This is because the Fermi energy\ncoincides with the degeneracy point of the monolayer\nand bilayer bands, and the value is indeed equal to the\nsummation of the minimum conductivity of monolayer\ngraphene [27] and that of bilayer graphene [28] estimated\nin the self-consistent Born approximation. In Fig. 3(d),\nfor the full parameter model, the conductivity is largely\nenhanced around \u2206\n(ext)\n1 = 0, because, as observed in\nFig. 2(c), the Fermi energy crosses the off-center part\nof the monolayer-like band making a large contribution\nto the typical band velocity. The conductivity drops\nsharply as \u2206\n(ext)\n1 grows from zero as the monolayer band\nis gapped away. When \u2206\n(ext)\n1 is increased further, the\nconductivity grows similarly to, but a little more slowly\nthan, Fig. 3(b), because of the tiny gap at the band\ncrossing point observed in Fig. 2(d). The differences be-\ntween Fig. 3(b) and (d) become smaller for larger W ,\nas disorder-broadening masks details dependent on the\nprecise values of band parameters.\nTo conclude, we have shown that the breaking of mirror\nreflection symmetry by interlayer asymmetry \u22061 in ABA-\nstacked trilayer graphene causes hybridization of the lin-\near and parabolic bands, leaving just two bands in the\nvicinity of zero energy. The band hybridization produces\nan increase in density of states and typical band velocity\nwith asymmetry \u22061, leading to an increase in minimal\nconductivity in qualitative agreement with recent trans-\nport experiments [19]. As demonstrated in Fig. 1(b),\nwhich compares the conductivities of trilayer and bilayer\ngraphene, the response of trilayers to gate-induced asym-\nmetry is in sharp contrast with bilayers, where the con-\nductivity is suppressed by a perpendicular electric field\nowing to the opening of a gap between the electron and\nhole bands [16].\nThe authors thank T.
