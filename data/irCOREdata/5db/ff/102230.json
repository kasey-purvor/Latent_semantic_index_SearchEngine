Introduction \nMaterials displaying fast ion conduction have attracted considerable interest due to \ntheir widespread technological applications. In the area of Li ion conductors, there is \nstill an ongoing search for a solid state material with sufficiently high conductivity to \nallow the use as an electrolyte in an all solid state lithium ion battery. To this end, a \nwide range of structure types have been investigated [1], with the highest bulk \nconductivities observed for the perovskite system, La2\/3-xLi3xTiO3 [2]. More recently \nthere has been growing interest in Li ion conduction in garnet-related materials \nfollowing the exciting discovery of high Li ion conduction in Li5La3M2O12 (M=Nb, \nTa) by Thangadurai and Weppner [3], with conductivities as high as 4 x 10-5 Scm-1 at \n22\u00b0C reported for the alkaline earth doped analogues  Li6ALa2M2O12 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba) \n[4-8].   \nAlthough these materials have cubic symmetry as for the traditional garnet materials, \ntheir structural features are somewhat complex, and have attracted a certain amount of \ncontroversy and confusion, particularly relating to the Li sites within the structure. \nThis can be related to the fact that the early structural studies employed X-ray powder \ndiffraction data [8-10], which makes location of the Li sites very difficult due to the \nlow X-ray scattering factor of Li.  More recently neutron diffraction structural studies \nhave been reported for Li5La3M2O12 (M=Nb, Ta) by Cussen [11]. This work identified \nthe space group as Ia-3d, with the Li occupying tetrahedral and distorted \u201coctahedral\u201d \nsites. Subsequently this structural interpretation has been confirmed by further work \nby Cussen et al., and a similar study of the higher Li content phase Li6SrLa2Nb2O12 \nwithin our group [12, 13]. In the latter it was shown that the distorted nature of the \n\u201coctahedral site\u201d gave a coordination closer to 4 coordinate, the remaining two Li-O \nbonds being quite long (>2.6 \u00c5). \nIn addition to the niobate\/tantalate garnets described above, related antimony \ncontaining systems are also known. In this respect, the synthesis of Li5Ln3Sb2O12 \n(Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm) have been reported by Isasi et al. [14, 15]. However, there was \nno characterisation of the Li ion conductivity of these Sb containing garnets. In a \nprevious paper we reported, the synthesis, structure and conductivity of the Nd \ncontaining analogue, Li5Nd3Sb2O12 [16]. The results showed a similar structure to \nLi5La3M2O12 (M=Nb, Ta), while the room temperature conductivity was an order of \nmagnitude lower and activation energy slightly higher.   \nIn this paper we extend this work to investigate the effect of varying the rare earth \nsize on the synthesis and conductivities. We also report neutron diffraction structural \nstudies for Li5La3Sb2O12. \n \n2. Experimental \nThe standard solid state reaction route was used to prepare the samples, Li5Ln3Sb2O12 \n(Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Ho). Stoichiometric amounts of dried Ln2O3 (Ln= La, \nNd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Ho), Pr6O11, Sb2O3 and a 10% excess of Li2CO3 were intimately \nground and then heated at 700\u00b0C for 14 hours in air (for the Li5La3Sb2O12 neutron \ndiffraction sample isotopically enriched Li2CO3, >99% 7Li, was employed,  so as to \nreduce problems with the high neutron absorption cross-section of 6Li). The powders \nwere then reground and pressed as pellets (2 cm diameter). The pellets were then \nheated at 925\u00b0C for 8-14 hours. Phase purity was established using X-ray powder \ndiffraction (Cu K\u03b11 radiation, Panalytical X\u2019pert pro system with an X\u2019celerator \ndetector).  \nConductivity measurements were performed using AC impedance spectroscopy \n(Hewlett Packard 4182A Impedance Analyser). Samples for measurement were \nprepared by pressing into 13mm diameter pellets and firing for 2 hours at 925\u00b0C. Au \nelectrodes were then affixed to the pellets using Au paste and the pellet fired again, at \n700\u00baC for 30 mins, to give good electrical contact between sample and electrode. \nTime of flight neutron diffraction data were recorded on the diffractometer HRPD at \nthe ISIS facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Data sets from two banks of \ndetectors were used for the refinement; the first was the data from the backscattering \ndetector bank and the second was the data from the 90\u00b0 detector bank. Structural \nrefinement employed the GSAS suite of Rietveld refinement software [17]. \n \n3. Results and Discussion \nX-ray diffraction indicated the successful synthesis of the garnet-related phase for \nLn=La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu. For the smaller rare earths (Gd, Ho), there was no sign of any \ngarnet-related phase, but rather the main phase obtained was perovskite-type, \nLn2LiSbO6. These results indicate that there is a minimum rare earth size for the \nstabilisation of the garnet phases, and they are consistent with previous reports by \nIsasi et al., where the successful synthesis of Li5Ln3Sb2O12 for Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm, \nwas reported. The work here, however, shows that this range of samples can be \nextended to Ln=Eu. \nConductivity measurements \nIn all cases, high conductivities were obtained (figure 1), with the highest room \ntemperature conductivity for the largest rare earth, Ln=La. In addition, all the samples \nshowed a change in activation energy at elevated temperature (between 200-300\u00b0C), \nwith the high temperature activation energy being reduced compared to the low \ntemperature range (e.g. for Ln=Nd, Ea decreased from 0.67 eV to 0.35 eV). The \nhigher activation energy in the low temperature region could be due to Li ion defect \ntrapping at low temperatures, and in this respect Cussen has proposed clustering of Li \nions within the structure [11], which could account for such defect trapping.  \nStructural refinement: Li5La3Sb2O12 \nFor the refinement of the neutron diffraction data, two models were investigated; that \nproposed by Thangadurai et al. for Li5La3M2O12 (M=Nb, Ta) from a combination of \nX-ray diffraction data and bond valence sum analysis, space group Ia-3 [8], and the \nCussen model, based on analysis of the same samples by neutron diffraction, space \ngroup Ia-3d [11]. In agreement with the neutron diffraction structural studies by \nCussen and our previous structural studies of Li6SrLa2Nb2O12 and Li5Nd3Sb2O12 [11-\n13, 16], the former refinement resulted in a poor fit and a generally unstable \nrefinement, and so further refinement continued with the Cussen structural model.  \nInitially refinement of the data employed the Li sites, Li1 at (1\/4, 7\/8, 0) (tetrahedral \nsite) and Li2 at (1\/8, y, z) (distorted \u201coctahedral\u201d site), resulting in a generally good fit \nto the data. However, the thermal displacement parameter for the Li2 site was high, \nand so in agreement with previous reports [11-13, 16], this Li was allowed to move \noff the ideal 48g site to give a 96h site, resulting in an improved fit, and a significantly \nreduced thermal displacement parameter. However, a close inspection of the profile fit \nindicated the presence of small high d spacing shoulders on the peaks (most \nnoticeable for the highest intensity peaks between d=2.0 \u2013 2.4 \u00c5) (figure 2a). \nAttempts to fit these shoulders by varying the peak shape were unsuccessful, and it \nwas therefore proposed that there was a small amount of a second very closely related \ngarnet phase in the sample. Therefore a further refinement was performed, with the \ninclusion of a second garnet phase with slightly different cell parameters. Due to the \nlow level of this phase, it was not possible to refine individual Li occupation factors, \nand so in the refinement it was assumed to have the same atomic parameters as the \nmain garnet phase. Inclusion of this second phase improved the fit significantly (chi2 \nreduced from 7.54 to 3.77) (figure 2b). The second phase had slightly higher cell \nparameters (a= 12.8816(3) \u00c5) than the parent phase (a= 12.84665(5) \u00c5), and the \nrelative phase fractions were determined to be 9.8% and 90.2% respectively. A similar \nsecond phase was also observed previously for Li5Nd3Sb2O12 [16].  The second garnet \nphase could be a result of Li volatility from the surface under the high synthesis \ntemperatures, and so may suggest a certain degree of non-stoichiometry in these \nsystems, which needs further investigation. Further evidence in support of this \nconclusion is the significant spread of cell parameters reported in the literature for the \nLi5La3M2O12 (M=Nb, Ta) systems with values between 12.766 and 12.807 \u00c5 reported \nfor M=Ta, and 12.762 and 12.889 \u00c5 for M=Nb [3,9,10,11]. The result highlights the \ncomplexity of these garnet systems. \nThe final refined structural parameters are given in table 1, with selected bond \ndistances in table 2. The refined structure for Li5La3Sb2O12 is in agreement with \nprevious reports on Li5La3M2O12 (M=Nb, Ta) and Li5Nd3Sb2O12 [11,12,16], with Li \npresent in both the ideal garnet tetrahedral site, and a more distorted second site \nnormally vacant in the garnet structure. In agreement with our previous studies \n[12,16], a close inspection of the second sites suggests that the coordination is \napproaching 4-coordinate with a further two longer (> 2.6 \u00c5) bonds. Compared to the \npreviously reported Li5Nd3Sb2O12, the occupancy of the Li1 site is higher and \nconsequently the Li2 site occupancy is lower (Li5Nd3Sb2O12; Li1 occ. = 0.62(2), Li2 \nocc. =0.262(5) [16]). Previously it has been suggested that the Li2 site is key to the \nhigh Li ion conductivity in these materials [11, 18], and so a close comparison of the \nconductivities of Li5Nd3Sb2O12 and Li5La3Sb2O12 is warranted. Despite the reduced \nLi2 occupancy, the low temperature conductivity of Li5La3Sb2O12 is slightly higher \nthan that of Li5Nd3Sb2O12 (figure 1). However at higher temperatures, the \nconductivity of Li5La3Sb2O12 drops below that of Li5Nd3Sb2O12. Given the previous \nsuggestion, that Li ion trapping effects are important at low temperatures contributing \nto higher activation energies, it could be proposed that reduced Li ion trapping in \nLi5La3Sb2O12 is responsible for the improved low temperature conductivity and lower \nactivation energy in this sample. At elevated temperatures, when trapping effects are \nmuch lower, the higher Li2 site occupancy may then account for the higher \nconductivity in Li5Nd3Sb2O12. \nConclusions \nIn summary, we have reported the synthesis and conductivities of the series, \nLi5Ln3Sb2O12 (Ln=La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu). The low temperature Li ion conductivity is \nshown to be highest for the larger rare earths (La, Pr, Nd). Structural studies of \nLi5La3Sb2O12 show a similar structure to Li5Nd3Sb2O12, although with higher \noccupancy of the Li1 site and lower occupancy of the Li2 site.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank EPSRC for financial support (studentship for JP) and ISIS, \nRAL for the provision of neutron diffraction beam time.
