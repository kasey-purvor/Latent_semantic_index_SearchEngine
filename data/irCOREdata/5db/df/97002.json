Introduction. Cancer is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in\nthe world (http:\/\/www.who.org\/). In the United Kingdom, one in four people will\ndie of cancer, whilst one in three will at some point in their life be diagnosed to have\ncancer (http:\/\/www.cancerresearchuk.com\/). Therefore, developed countries are in-\nvesting large sums of money into cancer research in order to find cures and improve ex-\nisting treatments. In comparison to molecular biology, cell biology, and drug delivery\nresearch, mathematics has so far contributed relatively little to the area. A search in\nthe PubMed bibliographic database (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/PubMed\/) shows\nthat out of 1.5 million papers in the area of cancer research, approximately 5% are\nconcerned with mathematical modeling.1 However, it is clear that mathematics could\nmake a huge contribution to many areas of experimental cancer investigation since\nthere is now a wealth of experimental data which requires systematic analysis.

JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\none could argue that to exploit fully the data generated by this huge experimental\neffort requires such an approach [1].\nThere are several different stages in the growth of a tumor before it becomes so\nlarge that it causes the patient to die or reduces permanently their quality of life.\nThere is a lot of controversy over how exactly cancer is initiated, but it is a generally\naccepted view that it requires several gene mutations to turn a normal cell into a cancer\ncell (see the recent review [2]). The factors that trigger these mutations are largely\nunknown, but are thought to include both environmental and hereditary effects. One\nof the outcomes of this series of mutations is an increase in the proliferation rate\nand a decrease in the death rate of the cells, giving rise to a clump of tumor cells\ngrowing faster than the host cells. However, even a fast growing clump of tumor cells\ncannot grow beyond a certain size, since there is a balance between cells inside the\nclump consuming nutrients and nutrient diffusion into the clump.2 Therefore, one\nof the most important steps in malignant tumor growth is angiogenesis, which is the\nprocess by which tumors develop their own blood supply. For this reason novel drugs\nare being developed specifically to target tumor blood vessels. Once the tumors have\nacquired their own blood supply, the tumor cells can escape the primary tumor via the\ncirculatory system (metastasis) and set up secondary tumors elsewhere in the body.\nAfter angiogenesis and metastasis, the patient is left with multiple tumors in different\nparts of the body that are very difficult to detect and even more difficult to treat.\nBecause there are three distinct stages (avascular, vascular, and metastatic) to\ncancer development, researchers often concentrate their efforts on answering specific\nquestions on each of these stages. This review aims to describe the current state of\nmathematical modeling of avascular tumor growth, i.e., tumors without blood vessels.\nThis is not to say that this is the most important aspect of tumor growth\u2014on the\ncontrary, from a clinical point of view angiogenesis and vascular tumor growth together\nwith metastasis are what cause the patient to die, and modeling and understanding\nthese is crucial for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, when attempting to model any\ncomplex system it is wise to try and understand each of the components as well as\npossible before they are all put together. Avascular tumor growth is much simpler\nto model mathematically, and yet contains many of the phenomena which we will\nneed to address in a general model of vascular tumor growth. Moreover, the ease\nand reproducibility of experiments with avascular tumors means that the quality and\nquantity of experimental evidence exceeds that for vascular tumors, for which it is\noften difficult to isolate individual effects. In particular, because some (but certainly\nnot all) tumor cell lines grown in vitro form spherical aggregates [3], the relative\ncheapness and ease of in vitro experiments in comparison to animal experiments has\nmade tumor spheroid assays very popular.\nThus we see the modeling of avascular tumors as a first step toward building\nmodels for fully vascularized tumors. In addition, there are some questions concerning\navascular tumors which may be interesting in their own right, including the recent\ncontroversial hypothesis that all humans have small dormant avascular tumors in their\nbodies [4]. There are also parallels between avascular tumor growth and the growth of\na tumor tissue in the microregion supported by a single blood vessel inside a vascular\ntumor, as illustrated in Figure 1, where the different regions of both avascular and\n2The exact manner of the nutrient-limited growth depends of course on the specific tumor type.\nFor example, melanomas grow on the surface of the skin as a thin layer and therefore they can grow\nmuch bigger during the avascular stage than solid tumors inside tissues. However, for one reason or\nanother even melanomas become angiogenic and can cause metastatic tumors.\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 181\nFig. 1 Left: Schematic illustration showing tumor spheroid growth. Right: 1 micron of spheroid\nsection showing the proliferative rim and the necrotic core. (Right panel reprinted from [5]\nwith permission of the Optical Society of America.)\nvascular tumors (to be explained shortly) are shown. Thus, avascular tumor modeling\ncan be of use when making predictions and designing experiments on vascular and\nmetastatic tumors, which are much more time consuming and difficult as they have\nto be performed in vivo.\nThe main finding of in vitro tumor spheroid experiments so far has been that the\nspheroids grow until they reach a critical size, when growth stops [3]. This critical\nsize is determined by a balance between cell proliferation and cell death inside the\nspheroid. The main experimental observations have been that when cancer cells are\nin a high nutrient environment they proliferate, in low nutrient levels the tumor cells\ntrigger cell death (apoptosis), and in intermediate nutrient levels the tumor cells stay\nquiescent. This translates into the schematic growth curve shown in Figure 1. The\ndifferent nutrient levels inside the tumor spheroid are determined by the movement\nand consumption of nutrients within the tumor.\nThe fact that in vitro experiments clearly showed that nutrient (in particu-\nlar oxygen) diffusion limits tumor spheroid growth paved the way for the angio-\ngenesis hypothesis. This hypothesis is that, in order to grow large, tumors need\nto obtain their own blood vessels and therefore must recruit vessels from the host\nvasculature through angiogenesis [6]. This hypothesis has led to considerable research\ninto a possible cure for cancer by identifying factors that would stop angiogenesis\n[7]. Currently, several clinical trials in their final stages are evaluating the efficacy\nand safety of antiangiogenic therapies and the scientific community is eagerly awaiting\nthe results (see the webpage describing current clinical trials http:\/\/cancer.gov\/\nclinicaltrials\/developments\/anti-angio-table\/). There are also several models describ-\ning different aspects of angiogenesis (see the recent review by Mantzaris, Webb, and\nOthmer [8]). However, in this review we will concentrate on the processes that take\nplace before the commencement of angiogenesis, during the phase of avascular tumor\ngrowth. We will also not discuss models that address evolutionary questions about\ncancer, i.e., how and why cancer comes about and how a normal cell turns into a\n182 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\ncancer cell over the course of its lifetime [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],\nbecause there is a good recent review already available [2]; nor will we discuss the\nadaptive response of tumors, although in many cases this can be analyzed via a natu-\nral extension of the models we present. Finally, we will not discuss models describing\ndrug delivery in this review. The mathematical modeling of drug delivery is so well\nestablished experimentally and theoretically that it itself requires a separate review;\nwe refer the reader to the recent review by Jain [20].\nThe process of nutrient consumption and diffusion inside tumors has been modeled\nsince the mid-1960s. There have been several reviews [21, 22, 23] of this area of tumor\nmodeling published over the last few years. However, they all focus on different\naspects to those we address. For example, the most recent review [21] discusses the\ngeneral concepts of modeling from a historical perspective, rather than focusing on\nparticular models. In the present review the aim is to describe some of the most\nwidely used mathematical models and developments in the area of avascular tumor\ngrowth in more mathematical detail. Hopefully this will engage applied and pure\nmathematicians while not alienating the biologists and chemical engineers who work\nat the interface between mathematics and biology.\nIn this review we can clearly not describe every model of avascular tumor growth.\nMost models fall into two categories: (1) continuum mathematical models that use\nspace averaging and thus consist of partial differential equations; and (2) discrete cell\npopulation models that consider processes that occur on the single cell scale and in-\ntroduce cell-cell interaction using cellular automata\u2013type computational machinery.\nWe will discuss each of the two approaches in detail and we aim to present a compre-\nhensive list of references for each category. In addition, in each of the categories, we\nwill discuss one or two models in depth. We have chosen these representatives because\nthey were published in or are frequently referenced in biological journals read by exper-\nimentalists in the area of cancer biology and in general make quantitative predictions\nthat have been validated experimentally. This approach to choosing the representative\nmodels ensures that we are by default selecting examples that have had real impact\nthus far on the scientific research of cancer. However, such an approach does mean\nthat we risk ignoring papers that have made crucial conceptual advances, or which\nhave put forward important hypotheses which are too difficult to test experimentally\nat the moment, or whose significance has not yet been recognized by the experimental\ncommunity. Therefore we broaden our review by summarizing these models also.\nIn the conclusion section a critique of the current state of mathematical modeling\nwill be presented and possible new emerging areas of mathematical and biological\nresearch will be highlighted.\n2. Continuum Cell Population Models. Mathematical models describing con-\ntinuum cell populations and their development classically consider the interactions\nbetween the cell number density and one or more chemical species that provide nutri-\nents or influence the cell cycle events of a tumor cell population. Thus these models\ntypically consist of reaction-diffusion-convection equations. One of the best param-\neterized of these models is due to Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24], and will\nbe described in the first part of this section. In the second part of this section we\ndescribe models from a relatively new and emerging area of avascular tumor modeling\nthat deals with modeling of the mechanical interaction between the tumor cells and\ntheir surroundings.\nCell Population and Nutrient Consumption Model. The paper that first pro-\nposed that diffusion and nutrient consumption might be limiting solid tumor growth\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 183\nwas probably Burton [25], and since then a large number of studies have described\nthe spatio-temporal interactions between tumor cell populations and nutrients [22],\n[24]\u2013[82]. Early models of nutrient-limited tumor growth calculated the nutrient con-\ncentration profiles as a function of tumor spheroid radius that was changing due to\nthe rate of cell proliferation [25, 29, 44, 49, 50, 58, 59, 66, 72]. The later models have\nincorporated differing degrees of complexity for cell movement. For example, cells can\nbe considered to move in either a convective manner [37, 45, 62, 67, 79] or actively in a\ndiffusive manner [65, 71, 75, 77, 80], or in a diffusive\/chemotactic manner [56, 62, 65].\nMost models consider tumor cell proliferation and death to be dependent on only one\ngeneric nutrient (most often oxygen). However, some consider the effect of several\nnutrients and pH on the cell population [24, 83]. While the details of any particular\nmodel in a specific experimental context are different, the fundamental underlying\nprinciple behind these models can be captured in the following short statement (see\nalso Figure 1):\nTumor cells consume nutrients. Nutrients diffuse into the tumor tissue\nfrom the surrounding tissue. Therefore, if the tumor is very large, the\nnutrients cannot reach all parts of the tumor tissue. This leads to a de-\ncrease in tumor cell proliferation and eventual cell death in regions lacking\nnutrients. The steady size of the tumor spheroid is reached when the cell\nproliferation in regions rich in nutrients balances cell death in regions poor\nin nutrients.\nAs the models which treat both diffusion\/consumption of nutrients and cell movement,\nrather than solely nutrient diffusion\/consumption, are more biologically relevant we\nwish to discuss one of these models as a representative of the class. One can find very\nfew experimentally validated models for simultaneous cell population and nutrient\ninteraction. Of these, we have chosen Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24] because\nit is a very good example of the class and it includes a sufficient level of biochemical\ncomplexity for it to be experimentally relevant. This model considers a spherical\ntumor and the interaction of tumor cells with oxygen, glucose, lactate, carbon dioxide,\nand bicarbonate, chloride, and hydrogen ions, and it aims to answer quantitative\nquestions on the expected pH inside tumors.\nEquations for Chemical Species Inside the Spheroid. The equations describ-\ning the distribution of molecular species inside the tumor spheroid are classical trans-\nport\/mass conservation equations. Figure 2 shows the schematic model for pH regula-\ntion inside the tumor cells [24]. The conservation equations for the different chemical\nspecies are\n\u2202Ci\n\u2202t\n+\u2207 \u00b7Ni = Pi,(1)\nwhere Ci are the concentrations of the chemical species, subindex a for oxygen, b for\nglucose, c for lactate ion, d for carbon dioxide, e for bicarbonate ion, f for chloride ion,\nand g for hydrogen ion concentration; Ni is the flux of each of the chemical species in-\nside the tumor spheroid; and Pi is the net rate of consumption\/production of the chem-\nical species both by the tumor cells and due to chemical reactions with other species.\nFor uncharged molecules, i.e., glucose, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, the flux is\ngiven by Fick\u2019s law,\nNi = \u2212Di\u2207Ci,(2)\nwhere Di are (positive) constant diffusion coefficients.\n184 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\nFig. 2 A model for pH, oxygen, and glucose regulation within the cell and its surroundings, after\nCasciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24]. (Reprinted with permission of Blackwell Publish-\ning.)\nThe flux of ionic species, i.e., lactate, bicarbonate, and hydrogen ions, in dilute so-\nlution must take into account both electric field driven charge migration and diffusion,\nand is given by\nNi = \u2212ziuiFCi\u2207\u03a6\u2212Di\u2207Ci,(3)\nwhere zi is the ionic charge of species, ui is the mobility, F is Faraday\u2019s constant, and\n\u03a6 is the electrical potential. For dilute solutions Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland\n[24] took ui to be given by the Nernst\u2013Einstein equation\nui = Di\/RgT,(4)\nwhere Rg is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and Di is the diffusion\nconstant. By applying the assumption that there is zero net electrical current, so that\u2211\nk zkNk = 0, (3) can be rewritten in the form\nNi = \u2212Di\n(\n\u2207Ci \u2212 ziCi\n\u2211\nk zkDk\u2207Ck\u2211\nk z\n2\nkDkCk\n)\n.(5)\nThus, the flow of a specific ionic species depends on the concentration gradients of all\nthe ionic species present in the tissue.\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 185\nFinally, by considering the breakdown of glucose through glycolysis and the Krebs\ncycle3 [84] and the detailed metabolic pathway for pH regulation (see Figure 2 for\nschematic representation) on a single cell level, Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland\n[24] arrived at the following terms describing the consumption of oxygen and glucose\nby the tumor cells and interactions between the other chemicals and ionic species in\nthis cascade:\nPa = \u2212\u2126\n(\nAa +\nBa\nCbCmg\n)(\nCa\nCa +Kma\n)\n,\nPb = \u2212\u2126\n(\nAb +\nBb\nCa\n)(\n1\nCng\n)(\nCb\nCb +Kmb\n)\n,\nPc = \u2212(2Pb \u2212 Pa\/3),\nPd = \u2212kfCd + krCeCg,(6)\nPe = kfCd \u2212 krCeCg \u2212 Pa,\nPf = 0,\nPg = kfCd \u2212 krCeCg \u2212 Pa + Pc,\nwhere \u2126 is the number of cells per unit volume of spheroid, assumed to be constant.\nIn (6) the relations for Pc, Pd, Pe, Pf , and Pg were derived using the detailed con-\nsideration of the Krebs cycle, and the parameters kf and kr are determined from\nthe detailed chemical reaction schemes. The functional forms of oxygen consumption\nPa and glucose consumption Pb were derived empirically from experiments. In par-\nticular, independent measurements of (a) oxygen consumption at different levels of\nglucose and pH, and (b) glucose consumption at different levels of oxygen and pH\nwere conducted and the empirical functional forms in (6) were fitted to the data. Our\nunderstanding is that this fitting was done by eye, rather than through a statistical\nanalysis (as is common in mathematical biology, since often only a few data points\nare available when estimating a nonlinear curve). Thus the functional forms for oxy-\ngen and glucose consumption should be considered representative, rather than cast\nin stone\u2014many other functional forms could be chosen. Indeed, it is almost certain\nthat different cancer cell lines would have different oxygen and glucose consumption\nrates, and it is not clear that they can all be approximated by the functional forms\nin (6); each would have to be assessed individually against available experimental\ndata. Moreover, even Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland themselves used a different\nfunctional form at low levels of oxygen and glucose, where they set [24]\nPa = \u2212\u2126(\u03c6a \u2212 \u03b2aC2b )\nC2a\nC2a + \u03c2a\nC2b\nC2b + \u03c2b\n,\nPb = \u2212\u2126(\u03c6b \u2212 \u03b2bC2a)\nC2b\nC2b + \u03c2b\n,\nwhere \u03c6a, \u03b2a, \u03c2a, \u03c6b, \u03b2b, \u03c2b are new fitting parameters which are again determined by\ncomparison with experimental data.\nThe chemical species conservation equations require boundary conditions. Cas-\nciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24] assumed that on the boundary of the spheroid,\n3The Krebs cycle is a sequence of 10 biochemical reactions, brought about by mitochondrial\nenzymes, that involves the oxidization of a molecule of acetyl-CoA to two molecules of carbon dioxide\nand water. Each turn of the cycle can result in the formation of 12 molecules of ATP (direct source\nof energy for cells) per molecule of acetyl-CoA [84].\n186 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\nr = R, there is a flux of chemical species given by the difference in concentration of\nchemical species in the bulk medium outside the spheroid (Ci,out) and concentration\nat the boundary of the spheroid, i.e.,\ner \u00b7Ni\n\u2223\u2223\nr=R = Ki(Ci,out \u2212 Ci),(7)\nwhere Ki is the mass transfer coefficient of species i, and er is the unit vector in the\nradial direction. The coefficients in (7) were measured using a Bellco spinner flask, and\nthe values were found to depend on the diffusivity of the molecule in question, viscosity\nof the culture medium, and spinner flask characteristics (the exact experimental setup\nis described in [85]). The boundary condition (7) is equivalent to Newton\u2019s law of\ncooling and assumes that the culture medium is well mixed. If this is not the case,\nthen it may be necessary to solve for the concentration of species in the culture also,\nimposing continuity of concentration and flux across the spheroid boundary.\nIn the case of spherical symmetry we also impose\n\u2207Ci\n\u2223\u2223\nr=0 = 0,(8)\nso that there is no singularity in the concentrations at the origin.\nEquations forCellMovement andProliferation. The spheroid growth equations\nproposed in [24] are based on the law of mass conservation, so that the velocity of cell\nmovement v is given by\n\u2207 \u00b7 v = \u03bbF (Ci),(9)\nwhere \u03bb is the maximum rate of cell proliferation and F (Ci) is the scaling function for\nthe nutrient\/chemical species dependent proliferation. To find the functional form of\nF (Ci) Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24] conducted a series of experiments to\nmeasure the cell population dynamics in cell monolayer cultures at different levels of\npH and oxygen and glucose concentration. Monolayer cultures are a good experimen-\ntal tool for determining reaction kinetics and cell proliferation characteristics, since\nnutrient and other chemical concentrations can be precisely controlled without spatial\nvariation. Of course, cell signaling cues arising from cell-cell contact may be different\nin monolayers and spheroids, but such effects are taken to be secondary and are not\nincluded in the model. Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24] fitted the data with\nthe following empirical function describing the rate of cell proliferation in different\nchemical environments:\nF (Ci) = G1\n(\nCa\nGa + Ca\n)(\nCb\nGb + Cb\n)(\n1\nCg\n)n\n,(10)\nwhere the Gi\u2019s are fitting parameters. Again, this functional form should be taken as\nrepresentative rather than set in stone. One limitation of the functional form (10) is\nthe fact that the cell proliferation term F is always strictly positive. This implies that\nfor the EMT6\/Ro spheroids considered in [24] there can never be a necrotic core, that\nis, a region where there is only cell death. Since the cells are proliferating everywhere\nthere cannot be a steady state for the tumor radius. Thus this model is applicable for\ntransient, pre-plateau phase spheroids. To model growth saturation and necrosis fully\nwe would need to include a cell death term in the right-hand side of (9). This would\nmake the model parameterization much more difficult since in addition to measuring\nnutrient-dependent cell proliferation, one would also need to simultaneously measure\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 187\ncell death, which can in principle also depend on the levels of metabolites inside the\nspheroid.\nEquation (9) implies that the cells are incompressible and there is no change in cell\ndensity at any given point in space, so that as a cell proliferates the cells surrounding it\nmove accordingly to accommodate the new arrivals. These assumptions are probably\nreasonable for spheroids grown in free suspension culture, but are more questionable\nin a confined environment.\nIn the symmetrical case of a spherical tumor we may suppose that the cells move\nradially so that there is only one nonzero velocity component, which depends only on\nthe distance from the spheroid center, r, and time. In this case (9) is sufficient to\ndetermine the movement of the tumor cells and the spheroid boundary. However, in\nany nonsymmetric situation conservation of mass alone is not enough to determine the\ncell velocity, and some form of force balance, along with an additional constitutive re-\nlation, needs to be considered. Such an extension complicates the model considerably\nand leads to difficult questions concerning continuum mechanics in growing media.\nThese are seen by most biologists as peripheral to the central biochemical nature of\ncancer. While this is undeniable, in the absence of symmetry it is difficult to see how\nto close a biochemical model such as (1)\u2013(9) without some discussion of mechanics.\nWe will return to this question later when we discuss generalizations of the model of\nCasciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24], but for the moment we continue to make the\nassumption of radial symmetry.\nBy solving (9) with spherical symmetry we find that the radial cell velocity vr at\na point inside the spheroid and the evolution of the tumor boundary R are given by\nvr(r) = \u03bb\n1\nr2\n\u222b r\n0\nF (Ci)d r,\n(11)\ndR\ndt\n= vr(R) = \u03bb\n1\nR2\n\u222b R\n0\nF (Ci)d r.\nEquations (1)\u2013(11) form a closed system and can be solved numerically or further\nsimplified to enable approximate analytic solutions to be obtained.\nWe stress that while the model by Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24] in-\ncludes several phenomenological functions and parameters, it is one of the best pa-\nrameterized models, and the relatively small number of phenomenological constants\nmakes it possible to compare the results of the model to experiments. Using the\nmodel Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24] predicted that the oxygen and glu-\ncose concentrations will fall in the middle of the spheroid, resulting in a significantly\nreduced rate of proliferation. This gives rise to the viable rim, that is, a region of\nhigh cell proliferation near the edge of the spheroid. The width of the viable rim\ncan be measured experimentally using immunohistochemical techniques to stain the\ncells at specific checkpoints in the cell cycle. Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24]\nreported that the experimentally measured width of the viable rim is in agreement\nwith that predicted by the model, although it should be noted that the experiments\ninvolved a limited number of trials and gave a mean width of the viable rim (7\u00b123)%\ngreater than that predicted by the model; the large spread in the result was due to\nthe high variability in the experimental data. The model also predicts that the pH\ninside the tumor spheroid should be different from that in the external medium, with\nhigher acidity at the tumor center than near the tumor boundary. This quantitative\nprediction has also been confirmed experimentally [24].\n188 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\nFig. 3 Comparison between Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24] model prediction (lines) and\nthe experimentally measured (symbols) values for glucose (squares and dotted line) and oxy-\ngen (circles and solid line). (Reprinted with permission of Blackwell Publishing.)\nThe study of Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24] is an example of the suc-\ncess of mathematical modeling in tumor biology (see, for example, Figure 3 for a\ncomparison between the predicted and experimental measurements of oxygen and\nglucose consumption), but it also highlights some of the dangers. Even with such a\nwell-parameterized model, the quantitative agreement of model prediction and exper-\niment is only satisfactory (far worse than could be expected in physics, for example),\nand the experiments themselves show a huge variation. This highlights the need for\naccurate measurements in order to generate accurate parameter estimates, but also\nwarns against placing too much emphasis on fitting models to data\u2014what is more\nimportant is to get the biochemistry correct qualitatively (which, of course, is what\nCasciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland were trying to do when they chose functional\nforms such as (10)), and to be able to predict general features of the solution (such\nas higher acidity at the tumor center) reliably.\nThere is a delicate balance when building any model between reliability and re-\nalism. As more and more is discovered about the detailed biochemistry of tumors\nwe have to guard against the tendency to develop overly complex or detailed mathe-\nmatical models for which we cannot hope to realistically or reliably estimate all the\nparameter values. While such models may seem sophisticated, their predictions are\nlikely to be less accurate than a better-parameterized simpler model. One of the\nadvantages of mathematical modeling in this regard is its ability to determine what\nqualitative details are sacrificed when simpler models are used.\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 189\nGeneralizations of Cell Movement and Proliferation Equation. Several mod-\nifications of the cell proliferation equations (9) and (10) have been presented in the\nliterature. We outline the main approaches below. The most general modification of\nthe model of Casciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24] would be to take into account\nexplicitly that the tumor comprises cells, interstitial fluid, and possibly extracellular\nmatrix, and to treat the tumor as a multiphase material with these as the different\nphases. The model will then need to describe the mechanical and biochemical inter-\nactions that take place between all the phases considered. If we include random cell\nmigration and cell death, each phase can be described by\n\u2202\u03a6i\n\u2202t\n+\u2207 \u00b7 (vi\u03a6i) = \u2207 \u00b7 (Di\u2207\u03a6i) + \u03bbi(\u03a6i, Ci)\u2212 \u00b5i(\u03a6i, Ci),(12)\nwhere, for phase i, \u03a6i is the volume fraction (\n\u2211\ni \u03a6i = 1), vi is the velocity, Di\nis the random motility or diffusion, \u03bbi(\u03a6i, Ci) is the chemical and phase dependent\nproduction, and \u00b5i(\u03a6i, Ci) is the chemical and phase dependent degradation\/death.\nThe most common models consider only the cell phase (as in Casciari, Sotirchos, and\nSutherland [24]), or cell and interstitial fluid phases.\nThe simplest version of (12), which has been used extensively, is a two phase\nmodel with the two phases being live cells and dead cells [67, 68]. If we know the\naverage volume of the live and dead cells, VL and VD, respectively, then the volume\nfraction equations can be converted into equations for the live and dead cell number\ndensity n and m, respectively, giving\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n+\u2207 \u00b7 (vnn) = \u2207 \u00b7 (D\u2207n) + \u03bb(n,Ci)\u2212 \u00b5(n,Ci),\n(13)\n\u2202m\n\u2202t\n+\u2207 \u00b7 (vmm) = \u00b5(n,Ci),\nwhere, of course, dead cells have no random motion. Usually D is constant, but\noccasionally (13) is modified to include nonlinear diffusion of tumor cells [65, 76, 77]\nby setting D = D(n,Ci). Most models consider only one chemical species (usually\noxygen or some generic nutrient), so that the biochemistry is much simpler than that of\nCasciari, Sotirchos, and Sutherland [24]. It is common to assume that the convective\nmovement of both cell types is the same, so that vn = vm = v, say [67, 68]. Then,\ncombining (13) with the volume conservation relation nVL +mVD = 1, we obtain an\nexpression for the cell velocity,\n\u2207 \u00b7 v = \u2207 \u00b7 (D\u2207n)VL + \u03bb(n,Ci)VL \u2212 \u00b5(n,Ci)(VL \u2212 VD),(14)\nwhich is the analogue of (9). In the case of radial symmetry this is again enough to\ndetermine v, without needing to worry about force balances.\nIn principle, the multiphase approach can be extended to include three or even\nmore phases (including different cell subpopulations, such as cancer and normal cells,\nor cells with and without a certain gene, or even drug carrying microbeads, etc.).\nHowever, it has to be noted that with the addition of each phase the parameterization\nof the model becomes more and more difficult, since large numbers of independent\nexperiments are needed to validate the model. The general multiphase model (12)\nneeds to be supplemented by equations describing the velocity of each phase. The\nusual practice is again to assume that all phases move with the same velocity, so\nthat with the further assumption of radial symmetry, conservation of mass allows the\n190 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\nvelocity to be found without worrying about constitutive relations and force balances.\nHowever, there seems to be no reason for the velocities of the components to be\nthe same or even of the same sign, especially when there is transfer between the\nphases. When the assumption of radial symmetry is dropped, so that force balances\nneed to be considered to close the model anyway, there seems to be no advantage in\nassuming that all the velocities are the same, and they may be better approximated\nby using constitutive laws for each phase and accounting for momentum transfer\nbetween phases. We will describe this approach in the next section when we consider\nmechanochemical models of tumor growth.\nSeveral mathematicians have analyzed generic nutrient-limited tumor spheroid\ngrowth equations with the aim of understanding qualitatively the sort of behaviors\nthat can arise as a result of different biological effects. For example, Burkowski [86]\nand Byrne [87] analyzed the effect of the incorporation of time delays in the cell pro-\nliferation and death terms in a generic nutrient-limited, spheroid growth model. This\napproach results in delay differential equations that the authors hypothesized are able\nto describe the oscillatory growth of tumor spheroids. Byrne and Gourley [35] consid-\nered what effect growth factors influencing signal transduction pathways of tumor cells\nhave on generic nutrient-limited spheroid growth. Chaplain, Ganesh, and Graham [80]\nhypothesized that the prepatterning of growth inhibitors and growth promoters on the\ntumor surface by a reaction-diffusion mechanism involving two unidentified chemical\nspecies could explain the asymmetries that arise during tumor growth.\nAn important set of experiments which give information about the movement of\ncells in tumor spheroids was conducted by Dorie et al. [88, 89]. The experiments\ninvolved attaching labeled tumor cells (in both homotypic and heterotypic combina-\ntions) and inert polystyrene microspheres to the outside of EMT6 cultured tumor\nspheroids. The results showed that while the distribution of labeled cells or micro-\nspheres always spread out (as it would due to random motion), if the labeled cells\nwere the same type as the tumor spheroid, then the maximum of the distribution\nremained at the spheroid edge, while labeled cells heterotypic with the spheroid and\ninert microbeads migrated towards the center of the spheroids, a process known as\ninternalization. Even when tumor cell proliferation was stopped by irradiation, this\ninternalization was still seen. These experiments have been modeled by several au-\nthors using multiphase continuum models [60, 62, 76]. Some of these models include\nactive cell migration to nutrient rich areas, with the microspheres forced into the\ncenter of the tumor as the cells squeeze past them; others explain the motion of the\nmicrospheres using only passive cell motion, as the cells at the center die and the\nouter cells replace them, carrying the microspheres with them. It is still not clear\nwhich, if either, of these effects is responsible for the internalization process.\nSeveral authors have modeled the invasion of tumors into other tissue using\ntraveling-wave solutions of diffusion-based tumor-cell-population models [55, 56, 65,\n73, 75]. Sherratt [65] performed a traveling-wave analysis of a nonlinear diffusion\nmodel for the interaction of tumor cells and the extracellular matrix with the aim\nof proposing a mechanism for the formation of connective tissue capsules around\navascular tumors. These capsules around solid tumors are highly collagenous layers\nof connective tissue surrounding the tumor and are most commonly found in large\nvascular tumors. Marchant, Norbury, and Perumpanani [55] analyzed a model for\ntumor cell migration and interaction with connective tissue and protease. Using a\ntraveling-wave analysis they were able to identify a range of possible behaviors, such\nas the development of spatial heterogeneity, traveling waves with wavy tails, etc. In\nparticular, their models address the question of how the tumor cell interaction with\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 191\nconnective tissue and protease influences tumor growth. They found that under cer-\ntain circumstances tumor cell profiles, as well as connective tissue profiles, can advance\nor recede like traveling waves.\nAs set out above there are a relatively large number of continuum cell popula-\ntion and nutrient consumption models. However, very few of them have been well\nparameterized and tested against experimental data. While experimental validation\nis undoubtedly crucial to the success of any model, phenomenological models can pro-\nvide a framework in which to think about the physical system, allow us to explore the\neffects of different hypotheses, advance our conceptual understanding, and even make\npredictions. An example of the latter is given by the model by Gatenby and Gawlinski\n[90] which describes the transition from benign to malignant growth using the acid-\nmediated invasion hypothesis. It consists of three coupled reaction-diffusion equations\nfor cancer cells, normal cells, and acidity and explores the hypothesis that, as a result\nof anaerobic metabolism, cancer cells create an acidic environment which kills nor-\nmal cells. The model predicts the existence of an interstitial gap at the tumor-host\ninterface and this prediction has been confirmed experimentally (see Figure 4). This\nexample shows the power of an interdisciplinary approach and illustrates its potential.\nIt is unfortunate that many model predictions are not tested experimentally.\nTissue Mechanics Models. Tissue mechanics models consider the mechanical\ninteractions between tumor cells with the aim of answering questions about how the\nmechanical properties of the tumor, and the tissue in which the tumor grows, influence\ntumor growth. Since the late 1970s there have been several models that in one way\nor another have introduced the concept of pressure or force between tumor cells [36,\n37, 39, 40, 43, 47, 50, 52, 60, 62, 63, 64, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102,\n103]. In addition, there have been a number of papers which have proposed ways\nto include the effects of mechanical interaction between tumor cells into the existing\nmathematical framework of nutrient-limited spheroid growth. This research coincided\nwith a conceptual change in cell biology away from a picture of cells as simple fluid bags\nto cells having some structural integrity, which was brought about by experimental\nevidence showing that cells have microskeletons which give them mechanical strength.\nA theoretical framework for understanding these microskeletons was pioneered by\nIngber, who introduced the concept of tensegrity structures to biology (Figure 5),\nwhich are mechanical systems that are stabilized by continuous tension. One example\nof this is the human body, which is stabilized and controlled by tension in muscles and\nligaments. However, this approach to modeling the mechanical properties of cells is in\nits infancy (we know of only one paper [104], which deals with a very simplified case),\nalthough it might become more popular in the future. Most models of cell tissue\nmechanics assume some bulk constitutive relation between stress and strain\/strain\nrate, averaged over many cells.\nThe early models built on the nutrient diffusion\/cell proliferation models discussed\nin the previous section by introducing a pressure inside the tumor. An example is\nthe model by Greenspan for avascular tumor growth [50], which was further devel-\noped by Byrne and Chaplain [92]. In this model the diffusion of a single, generic\nnutrient c is considered to be in pseudoequilibrium in time, so that inside the tu-\nmor spheroid \u22072c \u2212 \u03bb(c) = 0, where \u03bb(c) is the rate of nutrient consumption by\nthe tumor cells. As in the previous section, mass conservation of incompressible tu-\nmor cells results in a tumor cell velocity v given by \u2207 \u00b7 v = S(c), where S(c) is the\nnutrient-concentration-dependent net cell proliferation rate. The authors introduce\nthe concept of the spheroid internal pressure p, and relate it to the cell velocity v by\n192 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K.

(Reproduced\nwith permission of the Company of Biologists.)\nintroducing a constitutive equation\nv = \u2212\u00b5\u2207p,(15)\nwhere \u00b5 is a positive constant describing the viscous-like properties of tumor cells.\nThis constitutive equation can be interpreted in two different ways. The first inter-\npretation is as an overdamped force balance, in which the force on a cell maintains its\nvelocity rather than accelerates it. The second interpretation says that the tumor tis-\nsue is \u201cfluid-like\u201d and that tumor cells flow through the fixed extracellular matrix like\nflow through a porous medium, obeying Darcy\u2019s law. Whatever the interpretation,\nthis constitutive relation is used to derive the equation for spheroid internal pressure,\n\u2212\u00b5\u22072p = S(c). The model is closed by giving boundary conditions on the (moving)\ntumor boundary, \u0393(r, t) = 0, say. The equation of motion for any boundary point is\ngiven by n \u00b7 drdt = v \u00b7 n = \u2212\u00b5\u2207p \u00b7 n, where n is the unit outward normal.\nThe pressure on the tumor boundary is taken to be equal to the external pressure\n(Greenspan [50] included surface tension effects so that the pressure is proportional\nto the mean curvature on the tumor boundary). The second boundary condition is\non the nutrient concentration c. Byrne and Chaplain [92] hypothesized that energy is\nexpended in maintaining the cell-cell bonds on the tumor surface with the requisite\namount of energy increasing with the local curvature of the boundary. Assuming that\nthe nutrient acts as a source of energy for cell-cell adhesion, the authors took the\nconcentration of nutrient at the tumor boundary to be given by the Gibbs\u2013Thomson\n194 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\nrelation, i.e., c = c\u221e(1 \u2212 2\u03b3\u03ba), where \u03ba is the mean curvature of the tumor surface,\n\u03b3 is the surface tension of the tumor surface, and c\u221e is the nutrient concentration in\nthe culture medium outside the spheroid.\nIn summary, the model equations are\n\u22072c\u2212 \u03bb(c) = 0, \u00b5\u22072p+ S(c) = 0 inside \u0393(r, t),= 0,\nn \u00b7 dr\ndt\n= \u2212\u00b5\u2207p \u00b7 n on \u0393(r, t) = 0,(16)\nc = c\u221e(1\u2212 2\u03b3\u03ba), p = p\u221e on \u0393(r, t) = 0,\ntogether with initial conditions.\nThis model raises a number of interesting mathematical and experimental points.\nThe first point to note is that in the case of radial symmetry the constitutive equation\n(15) is not needed. The model is very similar to (a simplified version of) (1)\u2013(11) of the\nprevious section (except for the boundary condition on c at the tumor surface), and\nas before conservation of mass is enough to determine vr. However, the constitutive\nrelation (15) and the boundary condition p = p\u221e at the tumor boundary enable us\nto determine the velocity of the cells when we do not have radial symmetry. Such an\napproach would be one way to close the model (1)\u2013(11) when we do not have radial\nsymmetry, and is probably the simplest way we could think of doing so.\nThe second new feature of (16) is the hypothesized Gibbs\u2013Thomson relation in\nthe nutrient boundary condition. This seems a much more speculative addition, but\nit may be possible to check its veracity since experimental techniques for measuring\nthe strength of cell-cell adhesion in different nutrient environments are available. One\nnote of caution when moving away from radially symmetric solutions is sounded if we\nset \u03b3 = 0, in which case Byrne and Chaplain [92] found that the radially symmetric\nsteady state is unstable to small asymmetric perturbations, with the growth rate of\nthe most unstable mode tending to infinity as the wavelength tends to zero, so that\nthe model seems to be ill-posed in this case. This illustrates some of the difficulties\nin determining simple but sensible constitutive relations for tumor tissue mechanics.\nFurther analyses of the model, including a weakly nonlinear stability analysis, were\nconducted in [39, 40, 92]. Other modifications of the early cell mechanics models\ninclude the effect of growth inhibitors on the development of avascular tumors [37].\nThese models have given us insights into how various hypothesized mechanical\ninteractions affect nutrient-limited tumor growth. Comparing the predictions of such\nmodels to experimental growth profiles will help to determine what sort of mechanical\ninteractions we should be including. If this first hurdle is passed, to realize the model\u2019s\nfull predictive potential it needs to be carefully parameterized. While experimental\nvalues are available for several of the parameters, others are difficult to measure.\nFor example, the in vivo measurement of a pressure that is probably very low (\u223c10\nmmHg) in a sample that is very small in size (max 1mm) is technically very difficult.\nAn important role of modeling in this respect is to determine, via sensitivity and\/or\nbifurcation analysis, on which parameters the behavior of the model crucially depends,\nthereby identifying which parameters need to be measured accurately.\nWhile direct pressure measurements have yet to be performed, the landmark\nexperiments conducted by Helmlinger et al. [105] mean that there is experimental\nevidence which could be used to test tumor tissue mechanics models. Helmlinger\net al. [105] grew tumor spheroids in different stiffness agarose gels and saw that the\nstrength of the agarose gel influences the growth of the tumor spheroid, i.e., the stiffer\nthe gel the smaller the tumor radius during the plateau phase of growth. Since cells\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 195\ncan neither attach themselves to agarose nor degrade the agarose, Helmlinger et al.\n[105] concluded that solid stress inhibits tumor growth. More fundamentally, tumors\nin stiffer organs (bone, for example) should grow slower than tumors in very soft or-\ngans (the breast, for example), a concept that appears to make sense in the clinical\nsetting. Helmlinger et al. [105] estimated the solid stress that might be generated\nduring spheroid growth by measuring the mechanical properties of agarose gels, fit-\nting a nonlinear hyperelastic strain energy function to the experimental data, and\nusing this strain energy function to calculate the stress that is needed to move the\ntumor boundary from the initial one-cell radius to the final plateau-phase radius.\nHowever, as pointed out by Chen, Byrne, and King [97], the strain energy function\nused by Helmlinger et al. [105] does not satisfy the condition of no stress at no strain.\nFurthermore, reported values of the bulk modulus of the LS174T tumor used by Helm-\nlinger et al. [105] and measured by the same group of authors [106] are in the range\nof 30\u00b110 mmHg. Thus, if the stress within the spheroid was of order of 100 mmHg as\nclaimed in [105], then upon the release of the spheroid from the agarose, the spheroid\nshould swell to two to three times its prerelease size. This experiment of releasing\nthe spheroid from the agarose confinement was actually carried out by the original\nauthors and no large swelling was seen. Instead it was noted that the rate of spheroid\ngrowth was recovered after release, indicating that the solid stress actively influenced\nthe cell cycle instead of passively compressing the tumor tissue. It is therefore likely\nthat the stress in spheroids grown in agarose is actually lower than 100 mmHg, as\nreported in [105].\nDespite this controversy concerning the strain energy function, the paper by Helm-\nlinger et al. [105] has motivated several researchers to model this experimental situa-\ntion in more detail [93, 95, 97, 107]. Three of these papers are theoretical studies, while\nRoose et al. [93] presents a combined theoretical and experimental study with an aim\nto correct the quantitative estimate of the solid stress inside the tumor spheroids by\nconsidering a linear poroelasticity model where the tissue growth has been absorbed\ninto the stress-strain relation in a manner similar to thermal elasticity as used in\nclassical solid mechanics [108]. They used the following constitutive equation linking\neffective tissue stress to tissue strain and fluid pressure:\n\u03c3ij = 2G\u03b5ij +\n(\nK \u2212 2\n3\nG\n)\n\u03b5kk\u03b4ij \u2212 p\u03b4ij \u2212K\u03b7\u03b4ij , \u03b5ij = 12\n(\n\u2202ui\n\u2202xj\n+\n\u2202uj\n\u2202xi\n)\n,(17)\nwhere \u03c3ij is the effective stress in the tissue, \u03b5ij is the strain tensor of the tumor tissue,\nui are the displacement components, \u03b4ij is the Kronecker delta, K is the drained bulk\nmodulus of the tissue, G is the shear modulus of the tissue, p is the fluid pressure in\nthe tissue, and \u03b7 is the volume of new tissue created per unit volume of tissue which\nis given by \u2202\u03b7\/\u2202t = SC , where SC is the rate of production of solid phase tumor\ntissue.4 Thus, if there is no displacement of the tissue (i.e., \u03b5ij = 0), then the stress\nthat builds up is proportional to the bulk modulus and the volume of material created\nper unit volume.\nThe constitutive equation (17) is supplemented by the two phase tissue mass\nconservation equations\n\u2202\u03a6C\n\u2202t\n+\u2207 \u00b7 (vC\u03a6C) = SC , \u2202\u03a6\nF\n\u2202t\n+\u2207 \u00b7 (vF\u03a6F ) = SF ,(18)\n4This effective stress tensor can be derived by considering the solid phase and fluid phase stresses\nseparately, \u03c3sij = \u2212\u03a6sp+ 2G\u03b5ij + (K \u2212 23G)\u03b5kk\u03b4ij \u2212K\u03b7 and \u03c3\nf\nij = \u03a6\nfp\u03b4ij , thus the effective tissue\nstress \u03c3sij + \u03c3\nf\nij will be given by (17) (see [109] for reference).\n196 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\nwhere \u03a6C and \u03a6F are the tissue cell\/matrix and fluid volume fractions, respec-\ntively, vC is the cell\/matrix velocity, vF is the fluid velocity, and SF is the cre-\nation\/degradation of the fluid phase. Conservation of matter in the tissue, \u03a6C+\u03a6F =\n1, implies that \u2207\u00b7(vC\u03a6C+vF\u03a6F ) = SC+SF . Using Darcy\u2019s flow for the fluid move-\nment through the porous solid gives \u03a6F (vF \u2212 vC) = \u2212KH\u2207p, where KH is the\nhydraulic conductivity, while the assumption that the tumor may be described by\ntwo phases only implies that the new cell\/matrix phase is formed from the fluid phase\nand vice versa, so that SC + SF = 0. Finally the model is closed by a quasi-static\nforce balance, \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c3 = 0. The detailed biochemistry of tumor growth can be coupled\ninto the model above through the growth term SC , with equations added for nutrient\ndiffusion.\nWe may combine the equations to find a single equation for the rate of solid phase\ndilatation [93, 110], e = \u2207 \u00b7 vC , as\n\u2202e\n\u2202t\n= KH\n(\nK +\n4\n3\nG\n)\n\u22072e\u2212KHK\u22072SC .(19)\nSince the rate of dilatation of a spherically symmetric tumor is given by e = 1r2\n\u2202\n\u2202r (r\n2vCr ),\n(19) completely describes the cell velocity inside a spherically symmetric tumor, and\nis the analogue of (9) for a compressible material. In particular, note that if we\ntake the limit of incompressibility so that K tends to infinity, then (19) reduces to\n(9). Note also that (19) needs to be solved both inside the tumor and in the gel,\nwith different material constants in each and no production term in the gel. Across\nthe tumor\/agarose gel boundary there is a discontinuity of material properties, and\ncontinuity of stress and velocity is used to match the two regions together.\nThe model of Roose et al. [93] is very similar to earlier models of Jones et al.\n[107] and Chen, Byrne, and King [97], which treat the tumor as elastic rather than\nporoelastic. It is important to note that while biological tissue is often assumed to\nbe incompressible when modeled as elastic, in a poroelastic model the Poisson ratio\ncorresponds to that of the drained tissue, and may be significantly less than 12 [111]\n(the effective incompressibility arising from the interstitial fluid). Roose et al. [93]\nmeasured K directly in a confined compression experiment, and made quantitative\npredictions about the levels of stress and the volume of new tumor material created\ninside the multicell spheroids, estimating the level of stress to be about 10 mmHg.\nAlthough the model (17)\u2013(19) is much more complicated than (15), it is still based\non linear poroelasticity, with the corresponding assumption of small displacements,\nwhile biological tissue and gels such as agarose undergo large deformations and exhibit\nnonlinear material properties. Note, though, that in a radially symmetric deformation\nthe dilatation of the surrounding material is zero, so that there is no compaction of the\ngel. In this case its nonlinearity is likely to be less severe and the linear approximation\nmay not be too bad.\nIn addition to the models mentioned above, there are several other models which\nconsider the two phase nature of tumors [52, 63, 94] and the hyperelastic nature of\ntumor tissue [95]. For example, a recent paper by Landman and Please [52] presents\na two-phase (fluid and cell) model for tumor spheroid growth that aims to answer\nqualitative questions about the presence and size of the necrotic regions inside the\ntumor spheroid. The cell phase is considered to move in a Darcy-like fashion as in\n(5). It would be interesting to extend such models to see what effects the inclusion\nof cell traction forces [112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118] might have on the model\npredictions.\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 197\nAnother model presented by Byrne, King, and McElwain [96] considered a generic\ntwo-phase model for avascular tumor growth using the theory of mixtures. They as-\nsumed that the cell phase can be modeled as a viscous fluid, while the water phase can\nbe modeled as an inviscid fluid. This paper provides a basis for further developments\nby considering specific tumor lines for which this type of model might be appropriate.\nIn concluding the continuum modeling section of this review, we point out the dual\nrole of modeling. We focused initially on a specific model that was well-parameterized\nand which allowed detailed experimental predictions to be tested. However, in other\nsituations we are not in a position to do such detailed modeling. In these cases,\nthe role of modeling is in hypothesis testing and in helping to direct and formulate\nexperiments. Such, more basic, conceptual models can also lead to experimental\npredictions, an example of which is the aforementioned discovery of an interstitial\ngap between advancing tumor cells and regressing normal cells [90].\n3. Discrete Cell Population Models. With the huge advances in biotechnology,\nlarge amounts of data on phenomena occurring on a single cell scale are now avail-\nable. This, combined with in vitro experiments using tumor spheroids, sandwich\nculture, etc., and high power confocal or multiphoton laser microscopy that enables\ntracking of individual cells in space and time, has brought about the possibility of\nmodeling single-cell-scale phenomena and then using the techniques of upscaling to\nobtain information about the large-scale phenomena of tumor growth. There are sev-\neral upscaling techniques; the most popular ones are cellular automata [31, 119, 120,\n121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132], lattice Boltzmann methods\n[9, 133], agent-based [129, 134], extended Potts [135], and the stochastic (Markov\nchain combined with Fokker\u2013Planck equations) approach [97, 134, 136, 137, 138]. As\nin the case of phase-averaged continuum models discussed in the previous section,\nthe main difficulty with the discrete cell-based models lies in their parameterization,\nand thus these models are more appropriate for giving qualitative insights, instead of\ndetailed quantitative predictions.\nIn this section we will outline the main ideas behind the discrete approach for\nmodeling cell populations in cancer. All of the main approaches (cellular automata,\nlattice Boltzmann, agent-based, extended Potts, etc.) consider the state of each cell\nor population of cells inside the tumor to be characterized by the vector variable\nw = {x,v,u},\nwhere x is the position of the cell, v is its velocity, and u is a vector characterizing the\ncell\u2019s internal biological state, which may incorporate its position in the cell cycle, its\ninteraction with the local biochemical environment, etc. The mechanical interactions\nbetween the cells depend on their position x and velocity v. This type of state vector\nhas its origins in lattice Boltzmann and other statistical mechanics models, but we\nexpect that the cell velocity plays a lesser role in tumor biology since \u201ccollision effects\u201d\nbetween tumor cells are not comparable to those between gas molecules, for example.\nWhile it is in principle possible to write down a set of mechanical interactions between\ncells using statistical mechanics or Newton\u2019s laws of motion, this is not usually done\nsince the resulting system is large and complicated and extremely computationally\nexpensive, while at the same time many assumptions have to be made about the way\ncells interact so that its realism is not guaranteed. Thus it is more common to replace\nphysical laws of cell motion such as force and mass balances with cell movement rules.\nSome general principles for these cell movement rules are described below.\n198 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\nSince the cells of an automaton model correspond to biological cells (or collections\nof cells), it is easy and natural to incorporate the internal biochemical machinery of\nthe biological cell into the internal state variables of the automaton cell. This is\none of the main advantages of automaton models, and it makes it easy to consider\nheterogeneous populations of cells.\nThe difficulty with automaton models is realistically modeling cell motion. The\nfirst step in setting up the rules for cell motion is to partition the physical space\ninto automaton cells. The simplest partition is to discretize into a regular lattice;\nrectangular lattices are usually chosen for simplicity. An alternative partition used\nby Kansal et al. [121] distributes the centers of automaton cells randomly and then\nuses a Voronoi tessellation to divide space up into cells.\nThe second modeling decision is whether the lattice is fixed in time or varies as\nthe elements move. It is far simpler to consider a fixed lattice, with each automaton\ncell corresponding to either a biological cell or a vacant site, and with cells able to\nmove into a nearby lattice site containing a vacant site. Of course, it is much more\nrealistic to have lattice cells growing and moving, with the lattice evolving as the\ntumor grows, but such models are much harder to formulate and are therefore much\nrarer. In particular, while the rules of motion for fixed lattices can be formulated\nsimply in terms of cells moving between lattice sites, if the lattice is free to move and\nthe cells can grow, we are back into the territory of mass conservation and continuum\nmechanics to determine the rules for the motion of the cells.\nTo determine the rule for cell motion in a fixed lattice, most models assume that\nthe interactions between an individual cell and the cells surrounding it are localized\nin space and occur only with cells inside a certain neighborhood O, which is often\nthe cell\u2019s nearest neighbors, but may extend further than this. A typical cellular\nautomaton rule will say that if a location x is occupied by a cancer cell, this cell might\nproliferate with probability k1, it might bind to an effector chemical, such as a growth\nfactor or a factor causing the cell to die or become quiescent with probability k2, or\nthe cell might move to a neighboring site with probability k3. The proliferation of cells\ndepends on the levels of nutrients and waste products at any given point, and should\nideally be derived from the biochemical pathways affecting the cell cycle. A relatively\nsimple example would be an expression similar to (10) in section 2, where the levels\nof glucose, oxygen, and pH are considered to be influencing cell proliferation. In more\nsophisticated models cell proliferation may be the result of a network of ordinary\ndifferential equations modeling the internal cell machinery and signal transduction\npathways. The probabilities k1, k2, and k3 are usually taken to be independent\nof geometry and the mechanical environment of the cell, but these effects could in\nprinciple be incorporated also.\nOnce the decision has been taken to proliferate, the cell will divide into two daugh-\nter cells. On a deformable lattice this presents no problem, since the cell simply grows\nto be twice its normal size, and then splits into two, each of which is the same size as\nthe original. However, on a fixed lattice this growth is taken to occur instantaneously,\nand the new cells immediately occupy two sites. One of these cells is usually assumed\nto occupy the original site of the dividing cell, but the other requires an extra space.\nThere are several ways to determine where to put this new cell. Usually it is taken\nto move to a neighboring site, but we have to decide whether the surrounding cells\nshould be pushed away to make space (and if so, to where should they be pushed?),\nor whether the cell can only move to a \u201cvacant\u201d site. Determining where to put the\nextra cell is one of the main problems with the fixed lattice approach. Because of\nthe restrictions the fixed lattice imposes, it is extremely difficult to incorporate real-\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 199\nFig. 6 Simulation results with an agent-based model for two different cell anchorage strengths (re-\nproduced from Galle, Loeffler, and Drasdo [139]). Green cells have contact with substrate\nand blue do not have contact with substrate.\nistic physics or biology into such a movement rule. In addition, the particular lattice\nstructure chosen may artificially influence the global behavior, in a manner similar\nto the grid effects which may be observed when numerically approximating solutions\nto partial differential equations. In the latter case it is possible to quantify this ef-\nfect through mathematical analysis, but such a quantification is extremely difficult\nin cellular automata models. A similar dilemma is presented by a cell that does not\nproliferate but is highly motile. The movement of a cell to a neighboring site could\ndepend on (a) the number of vacant neighboring sites, (b) the nutrient concentration\ngradient, (c) the levels of matrix molecules in neighboring sites, (d) the mechanical\nenvironment of the cell and cells in neighboring sites, and so on. Any number of these\nfactors could be combined with a random motility assigned to each cell.\nDifferent cellular automata models incorporate different levels of complexity into\ncell movement, birth, and death laws. Having described their general formulation\nwe will now describe one or two specific examples of automaton models that have\nappeared in the literature. One of the first models considering discrete cell popu-\nlation migration using a complex cell cycle model, which is still considered to be\nsophisticated, was that of Duchting and Vogelsaenger [119], who conducted a series of\nthree-dimensional simulations using the model in order to determine the effect of ra-\ndiotherapy on tumors in a quantitative, well-parameterized manner (see the appendix\nfor the description of their model). Another of the early models that appears to be\nreasonably well parameterized is that by Qi et al. [120], which is one of the least com-\nplicated models of its type and describes the minimal cellular automata rules that\nwould reproduce the Gompertz law of cancer growth.5 See Figure 6 for a sample\nresult from single-cell-based modeling reproduced from [139].\nA recent three-dimensional cellular automaton model which does not use a reg-\nular lattice is that of Kansal et al. [121]. The model does not include nutrients or\n5The Gompertz law states that the volume of the tumor V (t) at time t is given by V (t) =\n[V0\nK\n]exp(\u2212rt)K, where V0 is the initial size of the tumor, K is the equilibrium size, and r is a positive\nconstant.\n200 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\nmechanical interaction between cells explicitly, but mimics the effects of both in a\nphenomenological way. The authors used a random fixed lattice and Voronoi tessel-\nlation, with the space that \u201cbelongs\u201d to a single lattice site consisting of points that\nare nearer to this site than any other lattice site. Note though that the \u201ccells\u201d of\nthe automaton each correspond to between 103 and 106 biological cells. A Delaunay\ntriangulation is performed to connect the sites which share a common face, thus de-\ntermining the neighbors of each of the lattice points. Having generated the lattice and\ndetermined the neighbors, Kansal et al. [121] ran a cell proliferation algorithm that\ndetermined the behavior of each lattice point at every time increment. In this model,\nthe proliferation is determined by the distance of the cell from the tumor boundary\nto mimic the effects of nutrient diffusion and consumption; only cells within a certain\ndistance from the boundary can proliferate. Similarly, cells a certain distance from\nthe boundary become necrotic. An ad-hoc scaling of (tumor radius)2\/3 is chosen for\nthese distances. Mechanical pressure effects on cell proliferation are mimicked by re-\nducing the probability of cell proliferation with the function (1 \u2212 r\/Rmax), where r\nis the radial position of the cell within the tumor and Rmax is the maximum tumor\nradius. With these simple interaction rules, Kansal et al. [122] and [121] produced\nthree-dimensional structures resembling tumors with different clonal tumor cell sub-\npopulations.\nKansal et al. [122] and [121] included nutrient and cell mechanics effects into the\nmodel in a highly phenomenological manner, by simply setting the proliferation and\ndeath rates to be known functions of position. To make the model more biologi-\ncally realistic, an obvious first extension would be to include the effects of nutrients\nand other chemicals explicitly in the model. One could start by using continuum\nequations for nutrient concentration and link this up to cellular automata models of\nthe cell cycle and cell migration. Such an extension would lead to a hybrid model\ncombining phenomena at the single cell level with continuum equations for macro-\nmolecular transport and comprising coupled discrete and continuum equations. A\nsimilar approach has been considered by Ferreira and coworkers [140, 141], who used\na two-dimensional hybrid cellular automaton to model a population of cancer and\nnormal cells. Growth factor concentrations are calculated from a continuous model\nwith the cells acting as delta function source\/sink terms, while the average nutrient\nlevels (where averaging is performed over the domain of a cell and its von Neumann\nneighborhood of 5 cells in total) influence the probability of cell proliferation.\nWhereas in most cellular automata models each lattice point consists of one or\nmore biological cells, in the Potts model approach [135] each biological cell is made up\nof several lattice points and the movement of each individual cell is determined by some\nform of energy minimization. This formulation can take into account cell membrane\ntension, cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, chemotaxis, etc. Such an approach is more\ncomputationally intensive than automaton models and is suitable for the detailed\nmodeling of small populations of cells.\nA purely theoretical framework for dealing with the interaction of the immune\nsystem with discrete tumor cell populations using a lattice Boltzmann approach is\npresented in a recent review by Bellomo, Bellouquid, and De Angelis [133]. This\napproach utilizes the single-molecule-scale computational machinery known from fluid\nand gas dynamics to consider collective phenomena of tumor cells. Care must be taken\nwhen applying this type of statistical physics approach to cancer cells as they are much\nless mobile physically, but their behavior is significantly altered by changes in the\nintracellular and intercellular biochemical signaling networks. However, the benefit of\nlattice Boltzmann models, Markov chain, Fokker\u2013Planck, etc., approaches originating\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 201\nfrom statistical mechanics is in the fact that there is already an existing framework\nfrom physics and fluid dynamics that deals with formalizing particle-particle or, in the\ncase of cancer, cell-cell interactions. Using this theoretical framework, one can also\nrecover the mean field continuum cell population models from the cellular automata-\ntype particle interaction rules.\n4. Discussion. While there have been some notable success stories of the appli-\ncation of mathematical models to cancer biology (a few of which have been discussed\nabove), mathematics has much more to offer and there is still a long way to go. Since\nthe biology and biochemistry of avascular tumor growth is highly complex and not\ncompletely understood, models have so far tended to be relatively simple, focusing\non the interaction of certain generic processes. This is a necessary step as we extend\nour intuition and understanding of the novel types of interaction thrown up when\nmodeling in the life sciences.\nWe see the role of mathematical modeling in cancer biology as twofold. On the\none hand, mathematical models are able to verify (or dispute) hypothetical word\nmodels suggested by experimentalists. In this case the conclusion that a model is\nwrong can actually be more helpful, because it shows that the biologists should be\nlooking for something else. Models can also help our intuition, provide a framework\nfor thinking about a problem, and make predictions. If a model is well-parameterized,\nthen these predictions can be quantitative, but even qualitative predictions can be\nsignificant. Gatenby and Gawlinski\u2019s work [90] is an example in which a simple three-\nequation model was able to explain a phenomenon that was previously thought to be\ninfluenced by many factors, with qualitative predictions that were largely independent\nof the specific parameter values.\nIn this respect, even purely theoretical studies of mathematical models have value,\nnot just to mathematics (such as new mathematical challenges and the development\nof new techniques), but also to biology (such as providing generic insight into how\ndifferent mechanisms may interact, or whether different modeling assumptions are\nlikely to lead to qualitatively different behavior).\nHaving said this, we feel that the field of cancer biology is now reaching a stage\nof maturity at which the next step in the modeling process must be the careful pa-\nrameterization of some of the models so that specific experimental predictions can be\nmade and tested in close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians.\nAs more and more biological details become available, particularly on the subcellular\nlevel as signal transduction pathways and biochemical networks are uncovered, these\nmodels are likely to become more and more complex. However, we need to guard\nagainst building overly complicated models which are poorly parameterized. While\nsuch models appear realistic, they may be little more than curve fitting, and may not\ngive as much insight as simpler better-parameterized models.\nIn the future, large multiscale models are likely to be needed, as researchers\nattempt to integrate detailed subcellular information to make predictions on the tumor\nscale. It is not clear at present whether these models will be continuum or discrete,\nor a hybrid of the two, since there are problems associated with each approach.\nContinuum models have the advantage of being more amenable to mathematical\nanalysis and understanding, and are thus better able to aid intuition and give insight\ninto underlying physical and biological principles. In addition they are likely to con-\ntain fewer parameters and can build on existing bodies of knowledge on continuum\nmechanics in other fields. On the other hand, the validity of the averaging over cells\nimplicit in writing down a continuum model is questionable, especially when cells of\n202 TIINA ROOSE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, AND PHILIP K. MAINI\nmore than one type are considered (in the final stages of development an avascular\ntumor spheroid is about 50 cells in diameter). It is also difficult to build the active\nnature of cells into mechanical laws for the tissue.\nDiscrete models have the advantage that they are perfectly adapted to modeling\ninternal signaling networks within each cell (see the typical result of a discrete model\nin Figure 6 reproduced from [139]). There is in addition no requirement that all cells\nbe the same; indeed, each can behave differently with no extra complication. The main\nproblem with discrete models is that it is very difficult to build in realistic movement\nand growth laws based on biology and physics. In addition, they usually contain many\nmore parameters and can only be analyzed computationally. Thus, while they can\naid intuition through numerical experiments, they do not give as much insight.\nIn purely discrete models it is also difficult to build in interactions with diffusible\nchemicals. These are much easier to treat as a continuum, which has led to an\nemerging field of hybrid models in which individual cells are treated discretely but\ninteract with other continuum fields. Such hybrid models are likely to develop further.\nAn extension of this type of modeling which is likely to be significant in the future is\nmultiscale models in which cells are treated both discretely and as a continuum, with\nkey pieces of information passed between the two scales.\nOne area where mathematics can be of assistance is in providing a bridge between\ndiscrete and continuum models through homogenization. This can be either what we\nmight call static, in which a discrete model is homogenized to give its continuum\ncounterpart, or what we might call dynamic, in which key pieces of information from\nthe discrete model are needed at the continuum level, and vice versa, so that the two\nmodels are coupled.\nFinally, we are beginning to observe closer collaboration between mathematicians\nand experimentalists so that the pathway from model hypothesis and parameterization\nto testing of model predictions should become more rigorous in future. It is clear that\nwhile the large number of parameters needed to build the models cannot be measured\ndirectly for every single specific experimental condition, much progress could be made\nusing standard techniques from physics and chemistry. For example, the motilities\nof biomolecules could be estimated using either the molecular weight of the molecule\nor its hydrodynamic radius and estimating the diffusion coefficient using the Stokes\u2013\nEinstein relation. However, this type of parameter estimation is rarely done in the\npapers that are in the mathematics literature, and thus some models appear to be\nless useful to experimentalists than they actually could be.\nWhile we have stressed the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between theo-\nreticians and experimentalists, we also point out the need for interdisciplinary collab-\noration between theoreticians. For example, proper validation of the above models\nwill require input from statisticians. The models above are all deterministic and ig-\nnore stochastic effects. It is important to study how such effects could change the\nbehavior of the models. Modeling is part of the arsenal of tools biologists have at\ntheir disposal. As such, it must be used appropriately to answer the questions that\nit is good at answering (focused scientific questions which aim to address a specific\nbiological aspect), and in conjunction with other biological tools that can address\nissues that modeling cannot.\nAppendix.\nCell Cycle Rules. In this section we describe the model due to Duchting and\nVogelsaenger [119] (see Figure 7). Each cell can stay in each stage for a given amount\nMATHEMATICAL MODELS OF AVASCULAR TUMOR GROWTH 203\nFig. 7 Cellular automata rules from [119].\nof time before moving to the next stage. The time it sits in each stage is drawn from\na different normal distribution for different cell cycle phases. The difference between\nnormal and tumor cells is that normal cells can go around the cell cycle only a finite\nnumber of times before arresting in a stable state, while tumor cells can go around\nthe cell cycle indefinitely.\nCell Movement Rules. Normal cell movement rules: before entering mitosis, a\ncell checks if there is a free position nearby; if so, then division takes place and the\nnew normal cell occupies the empty space. If there is no free space, then the normal\ncell will move to the resting phase.\nCancer cell movement rules: tumor cells can divide even when there is no free\nspace around. Uniform random variables determine the direction where the new\ncancer cell will be created. All other cells will be shifted accordingly.\nAcknowledgments. TR would like thank Dr. David C.
