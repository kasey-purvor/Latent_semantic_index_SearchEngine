Higher rates of\ncooling occurred during the late Eocene\u2013early Oligocene (c. 34\nMa), the middle Miocene (c. 14 Ma), and the late Pliocene (c.\n3 Ma) (1). The step at 34 Ma is associated with the onset of\ncontinental glaciation in Antarctica, and that centered on 3 Ma\nregisters the expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. The\nmid-Miocene step, often referred to as the middle-Miocene\nclimatic transition (MMCT), is the least understood, with sig-\nnificant questions surrounding its timing, style, and fundamental\ncause. Marine isotopic studies imply significant ice volume\nexpansion in Antarctica and coeval cooling of the Southern\nOcean (2). Because of the paucity of dated terrestrial archives\nfrom the continent, little evidence for climate change has been\navailable to constrain directly the nature and timing of the\nMMCT. This has resulted in a number of unanswered questions.\nTo what extent did the continent cool during the MMCT, and\nwas this cooling gradual or abrupt? What effect did the MMCT\nhave on the thermal regime of Antarctic glaciers? And from a\nbiological perspective, what was the ecological legacy of the\nMMCT for organisms whose ancestors had survived the cooling\nstep at 34 Ma? Did the extinction of a shrub tundra occur during\nthe middle Miocene, or was it delayed until the Pliocene (3, 4)?\nThe fossiliferous glacigenic sediments reported here are from\nthe western Olympus Range in the McMurdo Dry Valleys sector\nof the Transantarctic Mountains. The fossils and their glacial\ngeologic context permit analyses of theMMCT from three broad\nperspectives: paleoecological, glaciological, and geomorphologi-\ncal. The in situ fossil-bearing strata occur within several north-\nfacing valleys that open into McKelvey Valley, one of the major\nice-free troughs of theMcMurdoDry Valleys (Fig. 1). Prior work\nhas shown that surficial deposits in the Range include a basal\ngroup of unconsolidated tills deposited from wet-based alpine\nglaciers and an overlying group of stacked sublimation tills from\ncold-based alpine glaciers; on the basis of dated ashfall covering\nthe oldest (stratigraphically lowest) sublimation till, the transi-\ntion from wet- to cold-based glaciation occurred before 13.85 \u0001\n0.03 Ma (5). Results from our recent fieldwork show that\nlacustrine deposits interfinger with wet-based tills deposited just\nbefore the transition, indicating that a series of small lakes\ndeveloped where recessional moraines impounded meltwater\n(Fig. 1). It is within these lacustrine sediments that we find well\npreserved freshwater fossils and pristine, bedded ashfall. A date\nof 14.07 \u0001 0.05 Ma for an in situ ashfall layer, 3 cm thick, within\nan extensive sequence of locally fossiliferous lake deposits\nprovides a direct, unambiguous age for the last phase of wet-\nbased alpine glaciation and an age for tundra plants and animals\nthat had colonized the locally deglaciated terrain [Fig. 1, sup-\nporting information (SI) Table S1, and Fig. S1].\nThe best-studied fossil assemblage comes from a small (14,000\nm2) moraine-dammed basin at 1,425 m nearMount Boreas in the\nwestern Olympus Range (Fig. 1). Deflation by wind scour has\nexposed lacustrine beds, which are unconsolidated, planar, and\nnear-horizontal except where locally disturbed by the develop-\nment of polygonal patterned ground. At the basin center, the\nstratigraphy records infilling, first by glaciolacustrine silt and\nsand, later by diatom- and moss-rich muds, and finally by fluvial\nsands and debris f lows (Fig. 2). The diatom stratigraphy suggests\nthat the lake persisted for thousands of years, during which time\nwater levels fell at least once and the floor of the basin became\na bryophyte-rich mire. The small alpine lake continued to\nsupport obligate freshwater organisms even during the low water\nphase.\nMany of the fossils from the Mount Boreas lacustrine beds are\npreserved in exquisite detail. Themajority represent aquatic taxa\nthat inhabited the lake during an early shallow-water and later\ndeep-water phase.

The moss\ntissues are freeze-dried and, like dried museum specimens, can\nbe rehydrated. Comparison with herbarium specimens showed\nthat the dominant moss species is indistinguishable from the\nextant Drepanocladus longifolius, a bryophyte within the semia-\nquatic Amblystegiaceae (Fig. 3 A and B). Between stems and\nleaves of the mosses, we have found ostracode carapaces rep-\nresenting several instars of a single species. Remarkably, soft\nanatomy of appendages and mouth parts is preserved in a few\nspecimens as a result of replacement by an iron oxide mineral,\nmost likely goethite (Fig. 4A). The absence of key morphological\ncharacteristics presently does not allow the ostracodes to be\nassigned to a species, but their anatomy places them in the\nsuperfamily Cypridoidea. The numbers of specimens and the\ngenerations represented indicate that moss mats provided a\nfavorable habitat for these benthic crustaceans to complete their\nlife cycles.\nThe shift to deeper water and associated changes in water\nchemistry are recorded by changing assemblages of diatoms (Fig. 4\nB\u2013E). The shallow-water flora comprises colonial benthic fragilari-\noid genera (Staurosira, Staurosirella, and Pseudostaurosira spp.),\nwhich occur in profusion and with remarkable preservation in\nassociation with the mosses. In overlying sediments, these taxa are\nprogressively replaced by the genera Encyonema, Eunotia,\nGomphonema,Navicula,Pinnularia, andStauroneis. Toward the top\nof the diatom sequence, planktonic diatoms including Asterionella\nformosa and Aulacoseira spp. appear with increasing regularity,\nlikely a consequence of increased water depth to amaximumof 8m\n(Fig. 1C). The uppermost lacustrine strata contain only diatoms of\nthe genera Eunotia and Aulacoseira.\nThe diatom assemblages bear little resemblance to extant\nAntarctic f loras (6, 7), instead they have a far greater overall\nf loristic similarity to low ionic-strength lakes of the Arctic (8, 9).\nThe floristic succession from benthic alkaliphilous fragilarioids\nto planktonic acidophilous taxa, culminating with Aulacoseira\nand Eunotia, denotes a pattern of progressive lake acidification\nthat has striking parallels to postglacial lakes in the northern\nhemisphere, including the Arctic (10\u201312). Because natural lake\nacidification occurs on time scales of several millennia, whether\ndriven by edaphic (13) or climatic processes (12), a comparable\ninterval of deposition is envisaged for this diatom sequence.\nMoreover, the development of a diversified diatom flora con-\ntaining both benthic and planktonic components implies that the\nwater-body was both permanent and seasonally ice-free. The\nalgal f lora of modern perennially ice-covered lakes in Antarctica\nincludes planktonic forms that are either neutrally buoyant or\nmotile (f lagellate). The planktonic diatoms reported here (Aula-\ncoseira and Asterionella) do not fulfill these ecological prereq-\nuisites and therefore mandate circulation within the water\ncolumn to survive. Organic carbon isotope composition (mean\n\u000113C \u0002 \u000323.3\u2030) and organic carbon concentration (up to\n3.3%) of bulk sediment suggests that the lake was productive,\nmainly from algae with some aquatic mosses based on fossil\ncontent (Table S2).\n1000\n1250\n1500\n1750\n750\nN\nWet-based alpine till\nMoraine\nLacustrine sediment\n17\n50\n15\n00\n1\n2\n77\u00b0 30'\n161\u00b0 15'\n0 1 2 km\nMt Boreas\nMt Hercules\nMcKelve\ny Valley\nMt Aeolus\nO l y m p u\n s   R a n g\n e\n0 m 300 m\nSSW NNE\n0 m\n5 m\nMoraine \ncrest\nA\nB\nC\nBasin\nFig. 1.

The pollen and\nspore assemblage is the least diverse that has been recovered from\nCenozoic sediments in theRoss Sea area and suggests a habitat near\nthe climatic limits for plant growth (14, 15). The assemblage is\ndominated by Leiosphaeridia spp. and other algal cysts of uncertain\nprovenance. Angiosperm pollen is represented by abundant grains\nofNothofagidites lachlaniae from a species ofNothofagus (southern\nbeech), rare grains of Periporopollenites sp., probably from a species\nof Caryophyllaceae (pink family), and two tricolpate pollen types\nwhose natural affinity is less well known. Gymnosperm pollen is\nabsent, and the remainder of the palynoflora is comprised of spores\nof Belgisporis sp. (liverwort, possibly Marchantiaceae) and Copto-\nspora spp. (mosses, possibly Bartramiaceae), and more rarely of\nRetitriletes sp., a club moss in the Lycopodium fastigiatum group.\nMacrofossils of terrestrial plants are rare, consisting of stems and\nattached leaves of two species of small haplolepidous mosses. The\naffinity of one of themosses is unknown, whereas the other is either\na species of Dicranaceae (Dicranella) or Bruchiaceae (Fig. 3C).\nInsect remains are also rare. Most are submillimeter fragments of\nlarval head capsules, probably of a nematoceran Diptera (midge)\nspecies. The largest insect specimen is the base of a left elytron of\na small beetle with highly distinctive ornamentation (Fig. 3D).\nThere are too few characteristics to enable it to be taxonomically\nassigned, but size, ornamentation, and cuticle thickness suggest that\nit belongs to a weevil. From the palynoflora and the rare terrestrial\nmacroscopic remains, we infer that the slopes were mostly barren\nwith patches of bryophytes. Although no wood or leaves of Notho-\nfagus (southern beech) were found within the sediments, its pollen\nindicates that it was growing within the region, possibly at lower\nelevations. Our interpretation of a sparse lake-marginal vegetation\nis supported by isotopic data, which indicate minimal carbon input\nto the lake from terrestrial sources (Table S2). The fossil biota,\nwhich included vascular plants, insects, ostracods, and diatom\nspecies that do not currently occur in Antarctica, is completely\ndifferent from the existing biota of theMcMurdo Dry Valleys. The\nmodern biota is dominated by prokaryotes, eukaryotes only in\nprotected locations, and small numbers of species of bryophytes,\nrotifers, tardigrades, nematodes, collembolans, and mites (16, 17).\nThe existence of wet-based glaciers, proglacial lakes, tundra\nvegetation, and insect remains all indicate that the climate of the\nwestern Olympus Range at \u000414.07 Ma was warmer and wetter\nFluvial facies (top to bottom):\n1) Planar-bedded, fine to medium sand, 37 cm thick. \nOverlying beds coarsen upward and include cobble-\nrich debris flows (not shown; >1.5 m thick). \n2) Planar-bedded medium to coarse sand with thin \ngravel layers, 19 cm thick. \n3) Planar and trough cross-bedded medium sand with \nfine-sand interbeds, 19 cm thick. \n4) Sandy gravel, 3 cm thick. \n5) Trough cross-bedded fine to medium sand with \nsilty interbeds, 29 cm thick.

We are able to estimate summer warmth from\nthe modern autecologies of several of the recovered taxa. The\nclosest locations to the McMurdo Dry Valleys inhabited by the\nmoss D. longifolius today is on James Ross and Vega islandsn at\nthe northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (64\u00b0S) where the\nmean summer temperature (MST) is \u00031.7\u00b0C.o D. longifolius is\nsuch a widely distributed moss in both the northern and southern\nhemispheres (18) that we assume it would have colonized farther\nsouth in continental Antarctica if there were sufficient warmth\nand moisture to support its growth. Whereas the moss D.\nlongifolius provides an estimate for the minimum thermal envi-\nronment at the site, the paleoecology of fossil ostracodes and\nbeetle indicate a warmer MST. The nearest lakes with cypri-\ndoidean ostracodes today occur in the South Orkney Islands\n(60\u00b0S) where MST is approximately 1\u00b0C (19, 20). Likewise, the\nsouthernmost records for indigenous beetles are for the island of\nSouth Georgia (55\u00b0S), where the MST is approximately 5\u00b0C;p\nlathridiid beetle species have been recorded farther south on\nSouth Orkney and South Shetland islands (62\u00b0S), but they are\nconsidered to be recent human introductions (21). Together, the\nfossil data suggest that MST was\u00045\u00b0C. In comparison, the MST\nat the site today is approximately \u000312\u00b0C (22).\nTo estimate the amount of cooling that occurred between the\nwet-based glaciation at 14.07 \u0001 0.05 Ma and the onset of\ncold-based glaciation at 13.85\u0001 0.03 Ma, we used a steady-state\nthermomechanically coupled glaciological model with higher-\norder stress treatments (see SI Text). The model provides a test\nof basal-ice sensitivity for local alpine glaciers to varying atmo-\nspheric temperatures. Assumptions include minimal change in\nthe elevation of the western Olympus Range (23) and that the\nformer wet-based alpine glaciers were similar in size and shape\nto modern cold-based counterparts throughout the McMurdo\nDry Valleys region; the latter assumption is borne out by detailed\nmapping of recessional moraines from wet-based alpine glaciers\nin the western Olympus Range. Model results show that the\nmaximum atmospheric temperature consistent with cold-based\nalpine glaciation in the western Olympus Range is \u00033\u00b0C (Fig.\nS2). Given that maximum atmospheric temperatures are\nachieved during summer, the value can be seen as a conservative\nproxy for MST. If the landscape during the mid-Miocene were\nat a lower elevation, as some models of landscape evolution\nimply (24), then an even lower MST would be required to\nmaintain cold-based glaciation. The combined results from\npaleoecology and glaciological modeling indicate a minimum\ndecrease in MST of 8\u00b0C between 14.07 and 13.85 Ma. This\ninterpretation is consistent with the timing of a sea-surface\ncooling of 6\u20137\u00b0C between 14.2 and 13.8Ma inferred fromMg\/Ca\nratios of Southern Ocean planktonic foraminifera (2).\nAn ongoing debate centers on when hyperarid, polar-desert\nconditions became established in Antarctica. At question is the\nlong-term stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and whether\nglobal warming during the Pliocene (\u00043 Ma) (25) resulted in\ndeglaciation of the continental interior and permitted recoloni-\nzation of tundra organisms as far south as lat. 85\u00b0S (4, 26, 27).\nOur combined paleoglaciological and paleoecological results\nclarify several of these issues. First, the glacial stratigraphy and\ngeomorphology of the McMurdo Dry Valleys indicate that the\ntransition to cold-based, alpine glacial regimes at 13.85 Ma was\nnever subsequently reversed (5). Second, the exquisite preser-\nvation of several fossil groups recovered from Miocene lake\nsediments (Figs. 3 and 4) indicates minimal postdepositional\ndegradation, which is best reconciled by these assemblages\nhaving remained in a perennially dry and frozen state. Third,\nglass shards from the dated ash deposits show no evidence of\neither hydration or authigenic clay mineral formation (5, 28),\nsuggesting essentially no chemical weathering. Taken together,\nthese observations constitute robust arguments against the re-\nturn to warmer and wetter conditions at any time after the\nMMCT. Accordingly, we surmise that polar desert climate has\npersisted uninterrupted in the western Olympus Range, and by\ninference all regions in the Transantarctic Mountains south of\n77\u00b0S, since at least 13.85 Ma. This climate reconstruction is\nincompatible with either amarked reduction in the volume of the\nEast Antarctic Ice Sheet inland of the McMurdo Dry Valleys\nregion, or with the recolonization by tundra biota during the\nmiddle Pliocene.\nnBritish Antarctic Survey Plant Database, www.antarctica.ac.uk\/bas\u0001research\/data\/access\/\nplantdatabase\/index.php.

The ultimate cause of the climate change is uncertain.\nA decline in global pCO2, based on changes in stomatal density\non fossil leaves, has been proposed as the primary driver (29),\nalthough marine geochemical evidence suggests that pCO2 de-\nclined several million years earlier than the MMCT (30). Alter-\nnative explanations focus on tectonically driven changes to\noceanic circulation resulting in a reorganization of the ocean\u2013\natmosphere\u2013cryosphere system (2, 31, 32). Regardless of the\nultimate cause, this shift was sufficient to initiate the transition\nfrom wet- to cold-based alpine glaciation in the central and\nsouthern Transantarctic Mountains, and to induce the regional\nextinction of tundra plants and animals. The only possible\nsurvivors from this earlier biota are microscopic, mostly soil-\ndwelling organisms (33). The climatic and environmental\nchanges reported here were likely the most significant to have\nimpacted Antarctica since the initial onset of Cenozoic conti-\nnental glaciation. These results provide challenging but testable\ntargets for climate models, as well as new constraints for\nAntarctic biogeography.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We thank P.
