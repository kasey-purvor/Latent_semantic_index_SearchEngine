Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n2 \nAbstract \n \nThis paper describes the design, construction and use of a field-cycled-proton electron double-\nresonance imaging (FC-PEDRI) system for the detection and imaging of free radicals. The unique \nfeature of this imager is its use of a 450 mT detection magnetic field, in order to achieve good image \nquality and sensitivity. The detection magnetic field is provided by a superconducting magnet, giving \nhigh stability and homogeneity. Field-cycling is implemented by switching on and off the current in an \ninternal, coaxial, resistive secondary magnet which partially cancels the superconducting magnet\u2019s \nfield at the sample; the secondary magnet is actively shielded to avoid eddy currents. EPR irradiation \ntakes place at ~5 mT, following which the field is switched to 450 mT in 40 ms for NMR signal \ndetection. Full details of the imager\u2019s subsystems are given, and experiments to image the distribution \nof stable free radical contrast agents in phantoms and in anesthetised rats are described. \n \n \n \nKeywords: PEDRI, field-cycling, Overhauser imaging, free radical\nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn. Reson. Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n3 \n1. Introduction \n \nThe Overhauser effect has been employed as a method for imaging and detecting free radicals in \nbiological and other liquid-like samples for more than 15 years. In the method known as Proton-\nElectron Double-Resonance Imaging (PEDRI) an EPR line of the free radical of interest is irradiated \nduring the acquisition of an MR image, and the NMR signal in regions containing free radicals is \nmodulated by the Overhauser transfer of polarization from unpaired electron spins to water proton \nspins [1,2]. Provided the free radical concentration is sufficiently high, images collected with and \nwithout EPR irradiation will exhibit different intensities in parts of the sample that contain free \nradicals, and subtraction of the image data sets will yield a \u201cpure\u201d free radical image, showing only \nregions where free radicals are present.  \n \nField-cycled PEDRI (FC-PEDRI) was introduced in order to counter problems associated with high \nnon-resonant absorption of RF power from the EPR irradiation: in this technique the magnetic field B0 \nis switched between low and high levels during the pulse sequence, with EPR irradiation occurring at \na low value of B0 (called the evolution field, B0\nE\n) and NMR signal detection at a higher value (called \nthe detection field, B0\nD\n) [2,3]. Since the EPR irradiation is applied at low field (~4 mT) its frequency is \nalso relatively low (~100 MHz) and so the specific absorption rate (SAR) may be reduced to \nacceptable levels while maintaining the necessary Overhauser enhancement. Detecting the NMR \nsignals at a higher field means that the inherent signal to noise ratio (SNR) remains good, despite the \ntime spent at very low field during the pulse sequence. Figure 1 shows a typical FC-PEDRI pulse \nsequence. \n \nPrevious work has shown that, where there is an upper limit on the acceptable SAR in an FC-\nPEDRI experiment (for example in animal studies), there is an optimum value of B0\nE\n of around 5 mT, \ndepending on the EPR linewidth of the free radical and on the maximum permitted EPR irradiation \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn. Reson. Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n4 \npower [4]. It is also clear from that work, and from earlier work on field-cycling NMR relaxometry \n[5], that optimization of the SNR, and hence the sensitivity, will be achieved by using as high a \ndetection magnetic field as is feasible. We previously constructed and used a large-sample FC-PEDRI \nimager with a detection magnetic field of 59 mT [6]. In this paper we describe a new instrument for \nFC-PEDRI, with a detection magnetic field of 450 mT, and present initial results obtained using the \ninstrument. \n \n2. 450 mT FC-PEDRI Instrument \n \nFigure 2 shows a block diagram of the 450 mT FC-PEDRI system. Many of the constituent \nmodules are commercially available, while others were constructed in-house. The main sub-systems \nwill now be described. \n \n2.1 Field-cycling magnet and power supply \n \nThe core of the FC-PEDRI system is the field-cycling magnet. The magnetic field must be \nsufficiently homogeneous and stable during the detection period of the pulse sequence in order to \ndetect NMR signals and to use them to produce artefact-free images. The desired specification was \nthat the detection field should have homogeneity (after shimming) better than 1 ppm over a 60 mm \ndiameter spherical volume (DSV), should stabilise to better than 1 ppm of 450 mT within 10 ms after \na field ramp from B0\nE\n to B0\nD\n and should then be stable within 1 ppm during the detection period, to \navoid blurring in the readout direction. Furthermore, the reproducibility of the detection field from \nacquisition to acquisition should be within 1 part in 10\n8\n, in order to avoid ghost artefacts in the phase-\nencode direction. During the evolution period the magnetic field requirements are less stringent, but \nthe field must be sufficiently homogeneous and stable to allow irradiation of the EPR line(s) of the \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn. Reson. Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n5 \nfree radical under study. Here it was assumed that the narrowest EPR linewidth encountered would be \nthat of the triaryl-methyl (TAM) stable free radical developed by Nycomed [7], so that the shimmed \nhomogeneity during the evolution period should be better than 10 \u00b5T over a 60 mm DSV at a typical \nB0\nE\n value of 4 mT. To ensure constant efficiency over the duration of each EPR irradiation, the \nmagnetic field should be stable within 5 \u00b5T during the evolution period, and the set value of B0\nE\n \nshould be reproducible from line to line of the pulse sequence within the same tolerance. \n \nIn a similar manner to that used in our 59 mT FC-PEDRI instrument [6], the new system employs \nthe field-compensation method of field-cycling [5], in which a primary magnet generates the detection \nmagnetic field with high homogeneity and high stability and a secondary magnet, with lower \nhomogeneity, is used to partially cancel the primary field during the evolution period of the pulse \nsequence.  \n \nThe primary magnet, which generates the 450 mT detection field, is a conventional, self-shielded, \nsuperconducting whole-body MRI magnet (Oxford Magnet Technology, Oxford, UK) with internal \nbore 830 mm, originally designed to operate at up to 500 mT. As discussed above, the homogeneity \nand stability requirements of the \u201cfield-offset\u201d secondary magnet are less stringent than for the \nprimary magnet, so that a relatively simple, low-inductance coil can be used, making it possible to \nswitch the current rapidly, without having to employ an inordinately high drive voltage. On the other \nhand, the field-offset coil must be actively shielded in order to avoid eddy currents in the primary \nmagnet coil, and this does add to the total inductance of the offset coil assembly. However, the main \nadvantage of the field-compensation approach is the relative ease of maintaining field stability during \nthe detection period. The current in the secondary magnet must simply be held at zero, leaving the \nstable field from the primary magnet. A steady zero current is much easier to control than is a non-\nzero current, as would be required in a single-coil magnet design (where the current required to \nproduce the detection field could well be several hundred amperes). \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn. Reson. Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n6 \n \nAn actively-shielded, resistive field-offset secondary magnet coil was designed and built to the \nabove specification by Tesla Engineering Ltd. (West Sussex, UK). The coil assembly also incorporates \nan integrated shim and gradient coil set (see section 2.2 below). The internal diameter of the complete \ncoil assembly is 120 mm and its outer diameter is 752 mm. The important electrical characteristics of \nthe combined field-offset\/active shield coil are as follows: DC resistance 140 m , inductance 5 mH, \nfield strength per unit current 0.511 mT\/A. The current required to completely offset the primary \nmagnet\u2019s field of 450 mT is therefore 880 A, at which  the dissipation in the coil assembly is 108 kW. \nThe system is designed to operate at a maximum duty cycle of 66%, with an average dissipation of \n73 kW; this heat is removed from the coil assembly by a closed-circuit water-cooling system together \nwith a high-capacity chiller unit (Thermo-Neslab, Inc., NH, USA, model HX-2000). \n \nFigure 3 shows a schematic diagram of the complete magnet system, comprising the \nsuperconducting magnet, field-offset coil with its active shield coil, gradient and shim coils. Figure 4 \nshows a photograph of the complete magnet system with all its coils installed. \n \nMagnetic field cycling is accomplished by altering the current driven through the actively-shielded \nfield-offset coil, via an analog control signal generated by the pulse sequence controller (see section \n2.3 below). The field-offset coil\u2019s power supply is comprised of four power-supply amplifiers \nconnected in parallel (Copley Controls Inc., MA, USA, model 266), themselves powered by six 15 kW \nDC power supplies operating in parallel (Electronic Measurements, Inc., NJ, USA, model ESS 601). \nIn order to meet the stringent field-stability requirements (see above) the Copley power-supply \namplifier subsystem includes a feedback loop which incorporates a high-precision zero-flux current \ntransducer and control unit (Danfysik A\/S, Jyllinge, Denmark, model Ultrastab 860R). This enables \ncontinuous monitoring of the current driven through the field-offset and active-shield coils, with \nautomatic correction to account for any drift in the gain of the power-supply amplifier. \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn. Reson. Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n7 \n \nTo achieve the maximum possible Overhauser enhancement it is necessary to irradiate the free \nradical\u2019s EPR for at least 3*T1. In order to accommodate long-T1 samples in in vitro experiments, it \nwas desirable to have the capability of EPR irradiation periods as long as 2000 ms. Following the EPR \nirradiation it is necessary to ramp up the magnetic field from the evolution value (~4 mT) to the \ndetection field (450 mT) in a time that is short compared to the sample\u2019s T1. The Copley power supply \namplifier system is able to ramp the magnetic field at the sample from the evolution value to 450 mT \n(or vice versa) in 40 ms. \n \n2.2 Gradient and shim coils and power supplies \n \nMagnetic field gradient coils (X, Y, Z) and shim coils (Z\n2\n, Z\n3\n, Z\n4\n, XY, Z\n2\u2013Y2, ZX, ZY and B0) were \nintegrated into the structure of the field-offset and active-shield coil set described above (Tesla \nEngineering Ltd.). The gradient coils were designed to achieve pulsed magnetic field gradients up to \n60 mT\/m. They were driven by standard gradient amplifier power supplies, operating in current-\ncontrol mode (Techron, Inc., IN, USA, model 8522) which easily accommodated the 0.5 ms gradient \nswitching times typically used in the FC-PEDRI pulse sequences. \n \nIn order to achieve the necessary magnetic field homogeneity during both the evolution and \ndetection periods of the field-cycling pulse sequence, it was necessary to be able to switch between \n\u201cevolution-field\u201d and \u201cdetection-field\u201d shim settings under control of the pulse sequence. A special \nshim power supply was obtained for this purpose (Resonance Research, Inc., MA, USA). Both sets of \nshim settings are downloaded to the power supply prior to the initiation of a pulse sequence, and it is \nthen possible to switch between the two sets during operation of the pulse sequence via a single \u201cshim-\nswitch\u201d TTL logic line from the pulse sequence controller. \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn. Reson. Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n8 \n \n2.3 Pulse sequence controller \n \nThe system is controlled by a commercially-available console (Tecmag, Inc., TX, USA, model \nApollo). This controls all functions of the imager through software running on a separate PC, which is \nconnected to the console unit via a proprietary interface card. The pulse sequence controller also \nincludes a separate digital-to-analog (DAC) module to provide the X, Y and Z gradient-driver voltage \nwaveforms. The DAC module is connected to the console by three separate \u201cRJ45\u201d networking \n(Ethernet) cables (one for each of the gradients), while the output waveforms (between \u201310 V and +10 \nV) are fed to the appropriate gradient amplifiers by screened twin-cored coaxial cables.  \n \nIn order to control the magnetic field during the FC-PEDRI pulse sequence it is necessary for the \npulse sequence controller to generate a fourth high-precision, high-stability analog output, in addition \nto the usual three gradient waveforms. This was achieved by generating a waveform table during the \npulse sequence, and sending the 16-bit data to the console\u2019s parallel output port in order to drive a \nseparate, home-built DAC module, the output of which was connected to the input of the field-offset \ncoil\u2019s power-supply amplifier (see above). The DAC module was based on a high-precision DAC chip \n(Analog Devices AD669), and also employed a precision voltage reference (National Semiconductor \nLM169). The DAC module was located within the rack of the power supply amplifier, and its low \nvoltage supply was derived from that unit. In this way the connection (over a distance of about 5 \nmetres) between the console and the power-supply amplifier sub-system was entirely digital, thus \navoiding unwanted pick-up from the cables taking the power supply amplifier\u2019s output (up to 880 A) \nto the field-offset coil. In order to further minimise the possibility of interference, the parallel input of \nthe DAC chip was opto-isolated within the module. \nThe pulse sequence controller also has the facility to output a number of TTL logic signals during \nthe pulse sequence, in order to control external modules such as the shim power supply (toggling \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn. Reson. Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n9 \nbetween its evolution and detection field shim settings, see above) and enabling\/disabling RF power \namplifiers (see below). \n \n2.4 RF system \n \nThe console provides separate RF outputs for the NMR transmit channel (19.15 MHz) and the EPR \ntransmit channel (between 90 MHz and 110 MHz), each with timing and amplitude controlled from \nthe pulse program. NMR excitation pulses are sent to a power amplifier (Analogic Coprporation, MA, \nUSA, model AN8061), then through a home-built, passive transmit\/receive (T\/R) switch to the RF \ncoil. NMR signals pass from the RF coil through the T\/R switch and are pre-amplified by another \nhome-built unit before passing to the console\u2019s RF input for further amplification, demodulation and \nprocessing. EPR irradiation signals generated by the console are amplified by a power amplifier \n(Amplifier Research, PA, USA, model 75AP250) before being sent to the EPR resonator through a \npower meter (RS Components, UK, model W570), which allows the forward and reflected RF power \nto be monitored. \n \nTwo different NMR\/EPR RF coil\/resonator assemblies were constructed for use with the imager. \nBoth were designed for imaging samples up to 5 cm diameter, including live animals (typically rats, \nup to ~200 g body weight). The first used an Alderman-Grant resonator [8] to transmit the linearly-\npolarized EPR irradiation at 93 MHz, together with a separate, coaxial, saddle-coil for NMR \ntransmission and reception at 19.15 MHz, also in a linearly-polarized fashion. The second assembly \nused a double-resonance birdcage resonator to perform EPR irradiation at 106 MHz as well as NMR \ntransmission and reception. In this case, all three modes were circularly polarized, with the intention of \noptimising SNR and minimising SAR. \n \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn.

The resonator is \ncapacitively coupled through a trimmer capacitor  which allows the matching to be adjusted. The \nNMR saddle coil is 50 mm in diameter and 65 mm in length and is mounted co-axially inside the \nAlderman-Grant resonator. Again, a trimmer capacitor provides matching adjustment of the RF coil. \nUnloaded quality factors (Q-factors) of the assembled coil\/resonator were measured as 280 for the \nNMR saddle coil and 580 for the Alderman-Grant resonator used for EPR irradiation. \n \nThe true double-resonance coil assembly is a low pass, eight-leg, birdcage resonator supporting \nquadrature modes at both frequencies. It was designed following the work of Shen et al. [9]. The \nresonator is 60 mm in diameter and 80 mm long and is supported inside a 120 mm diameter cylindrical \nRF shield. For each frequency two inductive coupling loops are used to drive two modes of resonance \nin which the linearly-polarized RF magnetic fields are perpendicular to the axis of the resonator and to \neach other; driving these modes in quadrature produces a circularly-polarized RF magnetic field. For \nthe two proton frequency modes, coaxial cables link the coupling loops to two ports of a home-built \nquadrature hybrid junction. Dur\ndifference from the signals coming back from the resonator, as well as isolating the transmitter from \nthe pre-amplifier. The EPR irradiation signal from the EPR amplifier is connected to the other two \nports of the resonator via another hybrid junction, to generate the circularly polarized RF field at the \nEPR frequency. Unloaded quality factors of 80 (NMR) and 160 (EPR) were measured. \n \nAlthough the true double-resonance birdcage resonator represented a more elegant approach than \nthe Alderman-Grant\/saddle coil assembly, it can be seen that the Q-factors of both the NMR and EPR \nmodes were considerably lower in the case of the former design \u2013 for example, 80 (birdcage) versus \n280 (saddle) in the case of the NMR structures \u2013 peobably due to the considerable complexity of the \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn.

This meant that it was the Alderman-Grant\/saddle \ncoil assembly that delivered the superior performance, in terms of SNR, sensitivity and EPR \nirradiation efficiency. The only disadvantage of that assembly was that its internal diameter was \nsmaller (50 mm as opposed to the birdcage\u2019s 60 mm) due to the necessity to have coaxial structures \nwith space between them. \n \n3. Use of the imager \n \n3.1 Phantom studies \n \nIn order to test the system, a phantom was constructed using glass tubes (8 mm internal diameter) \ncontaining a range of concentrations of TEMPOL nitroxide free radical (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-\ntetramethylpiperidene-1-oxyl, Sigma\/Aldrich, Poole, UK) in aqueous solution. Figure 5 shows field-\ncycled images of the phantom obtained with and without EPR irradiation, together with a \u201cDifference\u201d \nimage obtained following subtraction of the complex with- and without-EPR data sets. It can be seen \nthat the images are artefact-free. In particular, there is no evidence of ghosting in the phase-encode \n(vertical) direction, despite the very large difference between B0\nE\n and B0\nD\n (4.6 mT and 450 mT \nrespectively) \u2013 this indicates sufficiently good reproducibility and stability of the detection field, due \nto the correct operation of the actively-shielded field-offset coil. Further evidence of the lack of eddy-\ncurrents associated with field-switching is provided by the absence of \u201csmearing\u201d in the readout \n(horizontal) direction, which might have arisen had there been magnetic field instability during the \nsignal sampling window. \n \n3.2 In vivo studies \n \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn. Reson. Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n12 \nLocally-bred male Sprague Dawley rats, body weight (BW) 175 g were used for in vivo studies. \nThe animals were anesthetized by using a single intraperitoneal dose of a ketamine\/xylazine mixture \n(41 mg\/kg BW ketamine (Vetalar, Parke-Davis, Pontypool, UK) and 20.5 mg\/kg BW xylazine \n(Rompun, Bayer, Bury St Edmunds, UK). A polythene cannula (0.96 mm outer diameter) was \nsurgically inserted into the left external jugular vein. After placing the animal supine within the FC-\nPEDRI system, a dose of free radical contrast agent was given via the cannula. In some experiments, \nthe free radical used was 3-carboxy-proxyl (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). In the work presented here \nthe narrow-line contrast agent triaryl-methyl (TAM, variant OX063) was used [7], which was obtained \nas a gift from Nycomed-Amersham, Malm\u00f6, Sweden. Solid TAM was dissolved to a concentration of \n200 mM in phosphate-buffered physiological saline. The pH of the injection solution was close to \nneutral. A dose of 0.58 mmol\/kg was administered by injecting 0.5 ml via the cannula, over the course \nof 45 s. At the end of the experimental period, animals were killed, under anesthetic, by an overdose of \nsodium pentabarbitone. All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with local guidelines \nand under British Home Office Project Licence No. PPL 60\/3177 (MAF). \n \nFigure 6 shows a set of coronal FC-PEDRI images (EPR-on, EPR-off and Difference) of a 172 \ngram rat, 51 minutes after injection of a dose of TAM; imaging parameters are listed in the figure \ncaption. A slice thickness of 30 mm was used, in order to visualize the free radical independent of its \nanterior-posterior position within the animal. In the difference image the animal\u2019s kidneys and bladder \ncan clearly be seen. The ureters are also clearly visible, despite the fact that they represent only a small \nfraction of the volume of a voxel (the voxel dimensions are 30\u00d70.8\u00d70.8 mm). \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nWe have built a field-cycled PEDRI imager with a detection magnetic field of 450 mT, suitable for \ndetecting and imaging free radicals in biological samples and small animals up to 5 cm in diameter. \nLurie et al. \u2013 Field-cycled PEDRI inaging of free radicals with detection at 450 mT \nMagn. Reson. Imaging 23, 175-181 (2005) \n \n13 \nThe relatively high detection field allows an improvement in spatial resolution and image quality \nrelative to our earlier FC-PEDRI imager, which used a detection field of 59 mT [6]. A further \nadvantage of the new system is its ability to produce conventional (i.e. non-field-cycled) images at a \nfixed field of 450 mT; these high-resolution images are advantageous in positioning samples prior to \nstudy by FC-PEDRI. As well as its use in the study of biological and in vivo samples, the new FC-\nPEDRI system is expected to be invaluable for the investigation of free radical contrast agents in non-\nbiological samples, for example in environmental science applications [10]. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nFunding was provided by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council under grant \nnumber GR\/M46488\/01 and by the University of Aberdeen.
