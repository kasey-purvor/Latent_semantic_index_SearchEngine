Globalisation has been accompanied by an equally global tendency towards devolution of \nauthority and resources from nation-states to regions and localities that takes on various forms, \ndepending upon which actors are driving the decentralisation efforts. The existence of a general trend \ntowards devolution also has significant implications for efficiency, equity, and administration. The \nauthors outline first the general drive towards devolution and then proceed to examine which \ncountries are experiencing which forms of decentralisation. A theoretical argument emphasising the \nrole of governmental legitimacy across various tiers of government is used to explain the diversity of \ndevolution initiatives, drawing on examples that include Brazil, Mexico, India, China, the USA, \nand some European countries. Having supported their model of decentralisation, the authors then \nexamine the implications of the widespread downward transfer of power towards regions. Some of the \nless widely discussed pitfalls of decentralisation are presented; caution in promoting devolutionary \nefforts is the prescription of this paper. \n \n \n1 Introduction \n \nResearch on globalisation has tended to stress the role global processes are playing in \nundermining the importance of nationally based policymaking, politics, culture, and \nsociety. Such trends are underpinned by the proliferation of communication and trans- \nportation media, the emergence of dominant forms of international, brand-based \ncapitalism, and the standardisation of various modes of interaction, from the conver- \ngence of languages to digitisation (Dicken, 1998). Accordingly, globalisation tends to \npromote what Agnew (2000, page 101) has called a new international homogeneity \nacross the global order. Such homogeneity implies a certain erosion of the importance \nof spatiality at the national, and by extension the regional, level as global processes \nsucceed in diluting and internationalising the traditional `nexus of interactions' asso- \nciated with local and regional spaces (Gray, 1998; see also Castells, 1996; Massey, 1999; \nStorper, 1997). \n \nYet, in spite of this, globalisation is failing to obliterate the importance of the \nlocal dimension across the world. In many ways, recent developments point in an \nopposite direction: towards a greater relevance of place, space, and regions. The \ngrowing visibility of the local and regional dimension has many manifestations. \nAlthough some argue that the demise of the nation-state is continuing, the rise \nin regional political activism (Rodr|\u00a8guez-Pose, 1998, pages 215f ), the increasing \nimportance of regionalism in government (Keating, 1998), and the regionally based \ncompetition that mobile capital is inducing (Cheshire and Gordon, 1998) have given \nrise to a renewed interest in the role of regions. In this paper we will concentrate on \none of the most significant recent developments at the global level: the widespread \ntransfer of power downwards towards regions. This process, which in some cases \ninvolves the creation of new political entities and bodies at a subnational level and in others an increase in their \ncontent and power, is known as devolution \n(Prud'homme, 1994). \n \nThere is now enough evidence to claim that since the outbreak of the process of \nglobalisation\u00f6and perhaps as a result of it\u00f6subnational units have increased their \ndemands for power. This process has numerous positive aspects but also raises impor- \ntant issues regarding national equity and welfare, public finance, and territorial \ncompetition. \n \nThe focus of this paper is thus fourfold. First, in section 2, in response to the often \nsimplistic conceptions of devolution, a theoretical model based upon Donahue's (1997, \npages 7 ^ 15) threefold classification of the mechanisms of devolution\u00f6legitimacy and \nthe decentralisation of authority and of resources\u00f6is introduced. Subsequently, in \nsection 3, we expose the devolutionary process in a selection of countries, including \nBrazil, China, India, Mexico, the USA, and countries of the European Union. These \nrepresent a cross-section of some of the largest areas of the globe and cover the \ndeveloped and the developing worlds. In section 4, different forms of devolution are \ncompared and examined. In section 5 we critically assess the global implications of the \ndevolutionary trend in light of its evident diversity. In the final section we conclude \nthat a greater awareness of the benefits and drawbacks of devolution is required in \norder to prevent the escalation of some of the downsides associated with it (section 6). \n \n2 The theoretical framework \n \nDevolution is a complex and heterogeneous process. From the high level of decentral- \nisation of certain federal states, such as Germany, and of some Spanish regions, to the \nmore limited power of regions in France or, until recently, Mexico, decentralisation \nprocesses across the world have taken on a variety of forms. Consequently, conceptual- \nisation of devolution is far from simple. Looking for a minimum common denominator, \nDonahue (1997, pages 7 ^ 15) characterises the process as being made up of three \nseparate factors: legitimacy, the decentralisation of resources, and the decentralisation \nof authority. Any form of devolution implies some degree of subnational legitimacy \nand some form of decentralisation of authority and resources; consequently, any \nanalysis of devolution should take these three factors into consideration. \nThere is, however, a need for caution in examining evidence, because a simple \nlist-based approach may overlook the interaction between the elements. The complex- \nity of the devolution process derives from the interest conflicts of the actors involved \nand the differences in legitimacy that they share. Most importantly, the interests of \nsubnational and national governments tend to be at odds across the component \nfactors of devolution. Although national governments would prefer, ceteris paribus, \nto devolve responsibilities (authority) to their regional or state governments with \nas few accompanying resources as possible, the subnational governments would \nprefer the opposite case. The balance between these extremes will depend upon the \nrelative strength, or, in political terms, legitimacy, of the two tiers of government.(2) \nIn figure 1 we illustrate this approach. \n(1) Prud'homme's (1994) classification of decentralisation into spatial, market, and administrative \ndecentralisation provides a useful conceptualisation. For the work in this paper\u00f6concerned with \nadministrative decentralisation\u00f6the redistribution of decisionmaking to lower government tiers \n(deconcentration) and the closer involvement of semiautonomous organisations (delegation) hold \nless importance than the third type of administrative decentralisation that Prud'homme outlines\u00f6 \nthat of power transfer to lower government tiers (devolution). As a consequence, throughout this \ntext decentralisation will be taken to refer to devolution. \n(2) Donahue conceptualises legitimacy as incorporating `popular support' and `citizen cooperation'. \nHe states that, ``ultimately the most important asset that government can command ... is not legal \nauthority, or fiscal resources, or even talented personnel, but legitimacy'' (Donahue, 1997, page 12). \n \n \nIf we begin at the bottom of the diagram, we can see that the legitimacy of subna- \ntional and national governments is determined for the most part by processes of history \nand political support. Regarding historical processes, culture, language, religion, and \nethnicity have traditionally been the factors behind a strong regional identity and deter- \nmine the legitimacy of subnational claims (see Litvack et al, 1998, page 1). Economic \ndevelopment has also recently been added to the list (Allmendinger and Tewdwr-Jones, \n2000; Keating, 1998). Regarding political support, the inclusion of legitimacy into the \nanalysis brings into play a wealth of political factors that shape the power and room \nfor manoeuvre of governmental tiers. An important caveat here, however, is that a \nreasonably effective political and democratic system must be in place to facilitate the \ninfluence of the electorate. This being the case, and all other things being equal, poor \npolitical support for the regional cause would translate into a relatively weak regional \nlegitimacy and tend to promote a devolutionary process in which the central govern- \nment holds the upper hand, favouring progressive decentralisation of responsibilities \nand often forcing regional and local governments ``to undertake increasing expenditure \nresponsibilities on a static, and often narrowing, financial base'' (Bennett, 1997, \npage 330). In contrast, a strong regional legitimacy, underpinned by high political \nsupport for the regional lobby, would favour a more rapid decentralisation of resour- \nces, as there would be strong demand for such transfers to subnational tiers \nof government. In general, the combination of historical and political factors in \ndemocratic countries shapes the legitimacy of governmental tiers, the relative strength \n \nFIGURE ONE HERE \n \nFigure 1. The complexity of devolution. Note: double-lined boxes and arrows indicate initial \nfactors and processes, respectively; single-lined boxes and arrows indicate subsequent factors \nand processes, respectively. \n \nof their respective lobbies, and hence the forms that devolution initiatives are likely to \nassume. In nondemocratic systems, however, the influence of the electorate is compro- \nmised and other factors, which are less transparent, take on more importance in the \ndetermination of the legitimacy of government tiers. \n \nAs depicted in figure 1 by the single-lined boxes and flows, the importance of \nlegitimacy and popular support does not end at the initial stage. There is also an endo- \ngenous role (if we assume again an operative political and democratic system). Following \ninitial moves towards devolution, in terms of decentralisation of resources or authority, \nthe popular perception of devolution will subsequently impact upon the legitimacy of the \ntwo government tiers. It is difficult to predict what direction this impact will assume\u00f6it is \njust as feasible to envisage a popular approval or disapproval of decentralisation originat- \ning from the centre, for example. Approval would mean a strengthening of central \nlegitimacy and disapproval would lead to a relative reduction, which, in turn, could \nbe translated into greater or lesser transfers of authority and\/or resources from the \ncentre to the regions. Although the political reaction to devolution is case-specific it \nnevertheless remains an important driver in the evolution of legitimacy between the two \ntiers, wherever a reasonable democracy has taken root. \n \nIn general, an understanding of the interaction between legitimacy and the transfer \nof resources and authority is imperative to the examination of devolutionary trends \n(Donahue, 1997). A case that depicts strong decentralisation of resources displays no \nmore evidence for devolution than one showing strong decentralisation of responsibili- \nties. It merely indicates a different type of devolution, driven by different levels of \ngovernment, and deriving, ultimately, from a different allocation of legitimacy across \ngovernmental tiers. Moreover, following from this, we should not necessarily expect \ncases to depict high levels of both resource and responsibility devolution, because forces \noften operate to promote their mutual exclusivity. It is with this conceptualisation in \nmind that we approach recent devolutionary efforts. \n \n3 The global trend towards devolution \n \nBefore the onset of globalisation the world was dominated by strong national govern- \nments, and regional governments tended to be either weak or nonexistent. Hence in \nEurope, with the exceptions of Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia, as \nwell as in Africa and Asia, central governments dominated throughout the postwar \nera. Latin American countries also had centralised states. Although some countries \nofficially maintained federalist or regionalist constitutions, such as Brazil, Mexico, and \nVenezuela, they tended to be federalist on paper, with regions and states representing \nlittle more than administrative units. In the former Soviet Union (USSR) the situation \nwas similar to that of Latin America. The USSR consisted of a union of sovereign \nstates on paper, but, in reality, was heavily centralised and controlled from Moscow. \nOutside this framework, only the above-mentioned European countries, Australia, \nCanada, India, and the USA had systems in which the regional tier of government \nplayed any significant role, and even in some of these cases the role of regional \ngovernments had been waning. This was, for example, the case of the USA, where \nthe power of the states had been declining with respect to those of the federal govern- \nment since at least the reforms introduced by Franklin Roosevelt during the Great \nDepression (Donahue, 1997); it was also the case in India, where the centrally based \nmechanism of planned economic development undermined the power of the regions, as \nthe central government dictated financial and economic goals to the states (Sury, 1998). \nAt the beginning of the 21st century this panorama has radically changed. A \ndevolutionary trend has swept the world. In some cases, subnational turbulence has \nled to the demise of former countries and to the emergence of new states. The fifteen \nconstituent republics of the former Soviet Union have become independent states; \nCzechoslovakia peacefully split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia; four new states \nhave emerged out of war-torn Yugoslavia, and Kosovo and Montenegro may follow \nsuit. This phenomenon is not, however, exclusive to former Central and Eastern \nEuropean socialist countries. Eritrea achieved independence after a long guerrilla \nwar, and East Timor has recently become an independent state after twenty-five years \nof Indonesian occupation. \n \nThe emergence of new independent states is an extreme form of a more general, \nglobal trend in the transference of power, authority, and resources to subnational levels \nof government. Few spaces around the world have remained untouched by this trend. \nEight out of the fifteen members of the current European Union\u00f6accounting for 87% \nof its population (Rodr|\u00a8guez-Pose, 2002, page 174)\u00f6have seen some level of decentrali- \nsation. In addition to the already federalised Austria and Germany, Belgium became \na federal state in the early 1990s, and Italy is in the process of federalisation. Spain, \ndespite not being a federal state, is arguably the most decentralised state in Western \nEurope. France has taken limited steps towards regionalisation\u00f6with ongoing debates \nover the granting of regional autonomy to Corsica. The United Kingdom and Portugal \nhave also transferred a considerable amount of power to some of their regions. Similarly, \nPoland has recently followed the path towards regional devolution. \n \nOutside Europe, devolution has also been widespread, especially in large and \nheterogeneous states. In some cases, regional autonomy has been granted ex nihilo. \nThis is the case for Indonesia, which passed autonomy laws aimed at undoing decades \nof extremely centralised government and at appeasing separatist tendencies in 1999 \n(Aspinall and Berger, 2001). In China, although political devolution has not formally \noccurred and the Chinese Communist party still keeps a tight grip on political devel- \nopments, there has been widespread fiscal decentralisation that has provided regional \nand local governments with considerable powers and that has encouraged policy \ninnovation at the regional level (Ma, 1996, page 5). \n \nIn other cases, preexisting levels of regional autonomy have been enhanced. The \nmost striking cases have been those of Latin American countries. In Mexico the \ncollapse of the economic system in 1982 and the political uncertainty that followed \nled to extensive changes in territorial politics. Although Mexico's constitution has \nofficially been one of federalism since at least the revolution of 1910 (Rodr|\u00a8guez, \n1998, pages 236 ^ 238), extreme presidentialism and the dominance of the executive \nbranch of government ensured seventy subsequent years of centralism and an enduring \ncentralist culture (Rodr|\u00a8guez, 1998, pages 235 ^ 236). But, asWard and Rodr|\u00a8guez (1999, \npage 28) assert, the last two decades have seen a dramatic improvement in the political \nsystems of representation, accountability, flexibility, and democracy and have led to a \nprofound reform of territorial politics in support of greater federalism. \n \nIn Brazil, the power of the states has been reinforced since the passing of the 1988 \nConstitution. The `regional interest' lobby was extremely influential during the draft- \ning process and was well placed to capitalise on the anti-central-government sentiment \nthat had been developing during military rule (Coutinho, 1996, page 7). The regions \nwere able to secure residual powers of legislation and maintain a lack of any clear \nconstitutional demarcation of responsibilities between the state, the centre, and the \nlocal governments (Dillinger and Webb, 1999, pages 9 ^ 11). This has subsequently \nafforded them a hitherto unprecedented level of discretion over their own financing, \nadministration, and responsibilities. \n \nAmong states that had considerable regional autonomy before the onset of global- \nisation, the trend has also been towards even greater decentralisation. In India, the \noverconcentration of power in the hands of a few national elites until the early 1980s \nbrought about a reaction that started to redress the balance from the centre to the \nregions (Sharma, 1999). In the USA, the trend towards centralisation, which some trace \nback to the American Civil War or to the Great Depression, started to be reverted \nduring Nixon's presidency in the early 1970s (Donahue, 1997), but it was really under \nReagan's New Federalism in the 1980s when states began to recover greater freedom of \naction. \n \nThe global trend towards devolution is based on subnational legitimacy and implies \ngreater transfers of authority and resources from the centre to the states or regions. In \nmost cases, and as in previous waves of decentralisation, regional legitimacy has historic, \nlinguistic, religious, and\/or cultural roots. Regions and states with their own ethnic, \nhistorical, cultural, or linguistic identity have paved the way for decentralisation. That \nhas been the case for Catalonia and the Basque Country in Spain, for Scotland in the \nUnited Kingdom, for Brittany and Corsica in France, and even for Chiapas in Mexico \nand for Tibet and Xinjiang in China, which have `brandished' ethnic, cultural, or \nhistorical arguments as the source of their demands for greater autonomy. Economic \narguments are also increasingly becoming a source of subnational legitimacy (Keating, \n1998). Uneven regional economic development, alongside the achievement of greater \neconomic efficiency through decentralisation, are coming to the fore and gradually \nstarting to occupy the bulk of the regionalist discourse in favour of decentralisation. \nThe Northern Italian Leagues were the first to base their devolutionary claims heavily \non economic demands after their failure to gain visibility by highlighting traditional \nethnic or linguistic issues (Diamanti, 1993). Nationalist and regionalist parties in Spain \nhave increasingly resorted to similar arguments, as indeed have the Zapatistas in \nChiapas. \n \nAdditional factors also contribute to boost the legitimacy of calls for decentrali- \nsation. In some circumstances, decentralisation goes hand in hand with democracy. \nThis is the case for Brazil and most of Latin America, where the advent of democracy \nand decentralisation are intrinsically related (Shah, 1991; Souza, 1997). Spain represents \na similar case: forty years of dictatorship generated greater legitimacy for the devolu- \ntionary cause and contributed to the profound territorial transformation of the Spanish \nstate after the return to democracy (Pe\u00a8rez D|\u00a8az, 1990). In other circumstances, decen- \ntralisation tends to accompany changes in the economic regime\u00f6especially moves \ntowards the marketisation of national economies. This trend has been followed in \nIndia, China (Ping, 2000, page 180; Da-dao and Sit, 2001, page 29), and, to a lesser \nextent, in Mexico and Brazil, since the opening of these countries to trade. \nThe process of devolution operates through transfers of authority and resources. \nSubnational governments across the globe currently enjoy greater authority and \npowers than they did a few decades ago. The trend is widespread. The powers of \nItalian regions have progressively increased since the late 1970s, and today they \nexercise considerable control in the fields of agriculture, tourism, regional planning, \nenvironment, and economic development (Rodr|\u00a8guez-Pose, 2002). All Spanish \nregions now have competence for health and education, and some have also secured \npowers over policy areas such as policing, taxation, and fiscal affairs, which have \ntraditionally been the prerogative of the nation-state (Castells, 2001). The Scottish \nParliament enjoys tax-raising and law-making powers, and the Northern Ireland \nAssembly, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Greater London Authority have \ntaken over varying levels of central government activities (Tomaney, 2000; Tomaney \nand Ward, 2000). \n \nOutside Europe, a similar transfer has occurred. The USA has, for example, \nwitnessed devolutionary efforts centred around two key areas: welfare and medical \ninsurance (Schram and Soss, 1998). In Mexico, the transfer of power from the centre \nto the states includes: the increased ability of states to raise revenue; greater control for \nthe states over development funds; a strengthened administrative capacity for the \nmunicipalities; and a clarification of the divisions of responsibility between different \ntiers of government (Rodr|\u00a8guez, 1998, pages 251 ^ 252). In India, state responsibilities \nembrace public order, police, prisons, irrigation, agriculture and related activities, \nland, public health, industries other than those centrally assigned, and trade and \ncommerce. In addition, states share with the central government authority over eco- \nnomic and social planning, education, labour, and forestry (Bagchi et al, 1992; RBI, \n2000). Chinese reforms since 1980 have been aimed at transferring to provinces greater \nresponsibility for budgets (Ma, 1996, page 5). The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 \ngrants, as mentioned above, state governors all those powers not otherwise prohibited \nby the Constitution (Dillinger and Webb, 1999). \n \nLast, decentralisation has also implied a substantial transfer of resources from the \ncentre to the regions. In figure 2 we illustrate the growth in subnational government \nexpenditure as a proportion of total government expenditure in our case-study coun- \ntries between 1982 and 1999. Readers should be aware of the limitations of these data \nfrom the International Monetary Fund as they do not convey the degree of local \nspending autonomy of subnational governments, do not distinguish between sources \nof tax and nontax revenues, intergovernmental grants, and other grants, and do not \ndisclose what proportion of intergovernmental transfers are conditional or discretion- \nary (Ebel and Yilmaz, 2002, pages 6 ^ 7). However, given the lack of alternative, more \ndetailed, and credible data sources, as well as the strength of the general trends \nidentified here, these data must suffice for our purposes. Two points are apparent. \nFirst, in the group of countries as a whole, there is an average increase of around \n15% in the proportion of subnational government expenditures. Second, as the frame- \nwork in figure 1 implies, not all countries are party to this trend. Some countries \n(that is, Brazil, China, and Spain) have witnessed a considerable decentralisation of \nresources, which, in the case of Brazil and China, has not been accompanied by similar \n \nFIGURE TWO HERE \n \nFigure 2. Subnational expenditure as a percentage of total Government expenditure. Note: in the \ncase of Brazil, Mexico, Spain, and the USA, figures include local government expenditure as well \nas state or provincial expenditure (source: IMF, various years). \n \nlevels of decentralisation of authority. In other cases, such as India, the decentralisation \nof authority has not been matched by a similar decentralisation of resources, as the \nshare of central government expenditure increased slightly at the expense of that of \nregional government during the period of analysis. \n \n4 Differing forms of devolution \n \nHaving established the existence of a widespread trend towards devolution in this \nsection we address its diversity, with reference to the theoretical discussion in section 2. \nRecall we examined the interrelationship between the legitimacy of governmental tiers \nand the form of devolution we can expect to find in a given country. In general, all \nother things being equal, where subnational governments have enjoyed relatively strong \nlegitimacy [as in the case of Spain (Rodr|\u00a8guez-Pose, 1996)], devolution biased towards \nthe decentralisation of resources can be expected; in contrast, where the central \ngovernment has dominated [as in the case of the English regions (Jones, 2001; Morgan, \n2002, page 802)], greater decentralisation of responsibility may well ensue. In this \nsection we present support for this contention by examining the cases of China, India, \nBrazil, Mexico, and the USA. \n \nChina's efforts towards decentralisation began in conjunction with its marketisation \ninitiatives in the late 1970s. The recognition that marketisation warranted a shift in \ngovernment outlook, from a commanding role towards facilitating functions, brought \nabout a series of fiscal reforms that saw the centre's influence over public resources \nreduced markedly across the 1980s (Ping, 2000, pages 180 ^ 181). By 1993 the provinces \nheld control over revenue collection, with the centre's share in total revenue falling \nfrom 35.8% in 1983, to 22% in 1993 (Yi and Chusheng, 2001, page 86). In terms of \nfigure 1, therefore, provincial legitimacy had soared to unprecedented levels, largely \nbecause of the enthusiastic nature of devolutionary initiatives. Furthermore, the impor- \ntance of the provinces was compounded by the introduction of negotiation-based fiscal \ncontracting between the provinces and the centre at the end of the 1980s (Lee, 2000, \npages 1009 ^ 1015), which allowed certain states, especially the richer ones, to exploit \ntheir bargaining positions to a far greater extent than under the previous formula- \nbased revenue-sharing contracts. The impacts of this rise in the power of the provinces \nin relation to the centre soon became evident. Alongside the stated increase in subna- \ntional revenue claims, the provinces were able to extract far more aid from the centre \nthan the centre itself could afford, contributing to the national deficit spiralling from \nparity to 600 billion yuan between 1985 and 1995 (Yi and Chusheng, 2001, page 90). \nInevitably, this effect was skewed towards the richer provinces, whose bargaining posi- \ntions were stronger, and Ma (1996, pages 22 ^ 23) documents a dramatic decline in the \nprogressivity of transfers from the centre to the regions between 1983 and 1991. Along- \nside this, as figure 2 illustrates, the central government's share in public expenditure fell \nsteadily, from around 53% in 1982, to under 30% in 1998, hindering macroeconomic \ncontrol and prompting emergency widespread fiscal reforms in 1994 (Bahl, 1999, pages \n105 ^ 129). Although these fiscal reforms succeeded in increasing the centre's involvement \nin revenue raising, Lee (2000, pages 1009 ^ 1015) documents the influence the provinces \nhad in preserving their expenditure levels, undermining the centre's equilibrating efforts. \nBut, although resources have been decentralised, many subnational governmental \nresponsibilities, in accordance with the marketisation of China, have been discontin- \nued, including large areas of responsibility over state-run enterprises. Overall, China's \nprovinces can be seen to have increased their legitimacy markedly over the past twenty- \nfive years, leading, as figure 1 would predict, to a surge in regional financing in excess \nof any accompanying devolution of responsibility. \n \nThe 1988 Brazilian constitution was written in an environment of pronounced \nhostility towards central government control (Hagopian, 1996, pages 259 ^ 262 and \n268 ^ 269). Constitutional provisions to curb national party dominance resulted in a \nlack of consistent central politics, a persistent feature of the Brazilian system since the \nreturn to democracy. In 1990 the twenty-seven states were represented at the central \nlevel by eleven different parties (Kraemer, 1997, page 35), and in such a climate it \ncomes as no surprise that state legitimacy and power have outweighed that of the \ncentre. As Dillinger and Webb point out, ``even when the President seems to have \nstrong political support on a roll call vote, that support is the result of extensive prior \nnegotiations and concessions to regional interests'' (1999, page 11). The power of the \nstates has been translated into unruly fiscal behaviour. States overspent massively \nduring the late 1980s and 1990s, to the extent of printing their own money, borrowing \nfrom their own banks, and running up huge state-level debts (Dillinger and Webb, 1999, \npages 23 ^ 25). Subsequently, the central government has serviced these debts and \nhas faced little choice but to offer financial assistance to struggling states (Montero, \n2000, page 67). \n \nMore recently, from the mid-1990s onwards, large debtor states have repeatedly \nthreatened the central government with default (Dillinger and Webb, 1999, pages 25 ^ 26) \nand in January 1999 seven state governments declared themselves bankrupt, contribut- \ning with their action to an economic crisis. Hence, state legitimacy can be viewed as so \nstrong in Brazil that not only have devolution initiatives been biased towards resource \ndevolution but also resource devolution has been paid for by the centre itself. Moreover, \nwhen individual fiscal packages with the states were eventually negotiated, beginning \nwith Sa\u00aco Paulo in 1997, the lack of extra debt-servicing responsibilities for large debtor \nstates confirmed that states had secured such a degree of legitimacy as to be able to \npromote resource-biased decentralisation yet avoid responsibility (Dillinger and Webb, \n1999, pages 25 ^ 26). Brazil therefore epitomises both the rapid decentralisation of \nresources and the gradual decentralisation of responsibility that we would expect, from \nfigure 1, to proceed from high subnational governmental legitimacy. \nIndia presents a contrasting case. Here, the continued legislative and administrative \ndominance of the central government has engendered a very different decentralisation \ntrajectory. Whereas the Chinese and Brazilian central governments yielded readily to \nthe provinces and states, the Indian central government maintained its influence and \nmanaged devolutionary initiatives largely to its own advantage. Historically, although \nIndia is a highly decentralised country, the influence of the central government has \nbeen consistently high. Following British rule, which emphasised the centre as a means \nof coordination of export and political control, the regimented system of five-year \neconomic plans has guaranteed the preservation of central legitimacy. So when, during \nthe 1980s, fiscal imbalance began seriously to affect the national budget, with the \ninternal debt of the central government rising from 15.9% of GDP in 1980\/81, to \n33.6% in 1993\/94 (Buiter and Patel, 1997, page 36), the temptation to exploit this \nlegitimacy advantage and to decentralise responsibilities began to manifest itself. \nThe Indian federal system is based upon three lists of responsibilities\u00f6accruing to \nthe centre, the centre and the states, and the states alone. The centre's progressive \nredefining of the contents of the state and joint lists has allowed the central government \nsubtly to raise the responsibilities of Indian states over the past twenty years (see Bagchi \net al, 1992; RBI, 2000). Simultaneously, aid to the states as a proportion of state \nexpenditure has actually fallen, from 54.3% in 1990\/91 to 50.6% in 1998\/99 (ICSO, \n1999). To find that central expenditure as a proportion of total public expenditure has \nrisen slightly over the period (as figure 2 illustrates) therefore comes as no surprise. As \ndiscussed in section 2, this fact should not be taken as evidence of centralisation but, \nas the preceding discussion confirms, a symptom of the form of devolution India has \nexperienced, underpinned by central legitimacy and consequently dominated by the \ncentral government's agenda. \n \nMexico and the USA represent intermediate cases. Political currents in Mexico \nhave also had a decentralising effect. Through the presidencies of de la Madrid \n(1982 ^ 88), Salinas (1988 ^ 94), and Zedillo (1994 ^ 2000) the historical dominance of \nthe centre has been progressively undermined. This is owed in large part to political \ndevelopments that served to make the centre more accountable and at the same time \nproviding regional politics and politicians with ever-increasing legitimacy. These devel- \nopments have taken various forms. The first set of changes took place in national \npolitics. The incorporation in 1977 of 100 (out of 400) seats based on proportional \nrepresentation, as opposed to the original, and remaining, first-past-the-post allocated \nseats, gave opposition parties some institutional voice at the central level (Ward and \nRodr|\u00a8guez, 1999, pages 23 ^ 27). In 1986 this representation was increased again as \nseats allocated on the basis of proportional representation swelled to account for 200 \nof the 500 congressional seats. \n \nRegional politics provided opposition politicians with a second forum. The central \ngovernment, suffering from a legitimacy deficit in the mid-1980s (Rodr|\u00a8guez, 1998, \npage 241), took the first steps towards greater decentralisation, but, with time, the pro- \ncess led to a rise in state legitimacy. As one would predict from figure 1, devolution \ninitiatives have graduated from emphasising the decentralisation of responsibilities to the \nstates initially, towards a much more well-funded programme as states have risen in \npolitical terms and the fallibility of the centre has developed. Hence, under de la Madrid, \nalthough devolution initiatives emphasised the `autonomy' of regions and included many \ninitiatives designed to give the states and municipalities of Mexico `greater freedom' \nover their own governance, these policies could be dismissed as either lip service or \nthinly veiled excuses to dump expenditure responsibilities on the states (Ward and \nRodr|\u00a8guez, 1999, pages 51 ^ 53). During Salinas's presidency further responsibilities \nwere devolved to the states and localities, including comprehensive welfare duties. \nDuring this period the election of opposition governors began to shift the legitimacy \nbalance in favour of the states. Finally, Zedillo's ascendancy to the presidency brought \nwith it the renunciation of presidential metaconstitutional powers and the initiation of \na cross-party forum on intergovernmental relations that has defined drives towards a \nnew federalism in the country since 1996. The level of transparency and cogovernance \nthese initiatives have achieved have guaranteed the states at least a reasonable accom- \npaniment of resources with each devolutionary effort (Ward and Rodr|\u00a8guez, 1999). In \ngeneral, then, the 1980s and 1990s have witnessed an increase in devolution of \nresources alongside devolution of responsibility as a result of political changes that \nhave acted to equalise the relative legitimacy of governmental tiers, in line with the \nmechanisms illustrated in figure 1. \n \nThe case of the USA, in spite of significant political and economic differences, bears \nsome similarities to the case of Mexico. As in Mexico, it was the centre, under the \npresidencies of Nixon and Reagan, that initiated drives towards devolution (Donahue, \n1997). Indeed, Nixon coined the phrase `New Federalism' in his bid to involve the states \nmore closely in national governance. Popular disillusionment with the centre during the \n1970s and 1980s, following the Vietnam War, the oil crises, and a shift in ideological \nprinciples away from macroeconomic management, served as a convenient political \nplatform from which to launch various responsibility-shifting policies. The 1990s, during \nClinton's presidency, saw a continuation of this trend, with the introduction of block \ngrants for welfare shifting much of the risk and decisionmaking capacity for social \nsecurity to the states, but including only nominal, and potentially short-lived, increases \nin funding (Powers, 1999). Central legitimacy, therefore, had so far served to emphasise \nresponsibility-biased devolution in the USA. \n \nAs with Mexico, however, there have been forces operating to dilute this domi- \nnance, which have gained greater momentum over the past ten years.Whereas Mexico \nexperienced an exogenous strengthening state-level legitimacy, driven by the political \nrevolution, America's states have been able to bolster their own bargaining and negotiat- \ning positions as a result of endogenous factors\u00f6precisely because their responsibilities \nand authority have increased throughout the reforms. The states have benefited from a \npositive popular perception of devolution, which has increasingly held the central \ngovernment to account. As Donahue (1997, page 13) asserts, \n``Contemporary opinion surveys ... show dwindling faith in the federal government \nand (at least in relative terms) rising state legitimacy ... [T]he fraction of respon- \ndents identifying the federal government as `the level from which you feel you get \nleast for your money' rose by 10 points (to 46%) between 1989 and 1994 alone.'' \nThis rise in legitimacy of the states has acted to curb the emphasis on responsibility so \nprominent in previous devolutionary efforts. As an illustration, President Clinton's \nreluctance to devolve responsibilities for medical health, although trumpeted as a \nmoralistic decision in order to safeguard equity, was prompted by widespread resis- \ntance from the states, whose fears over defective funding procedures stemmed from \ntheir experience of welfare reform (Offner, 1999). As regional and state-level politics \ncontinues to become more important in the USA, such checks and balances will act \nto equalise the devolution of responsibilities and resources. In the future, greater \ndevolution of resources to the states may become a political necessity for the centre. \n \n5 The impacts of the devolutionary trend \n \nAt this point we are able to draw two conclusions. First, as evidenced in section 3, the \ndevolutionary trend is a common and general one. Second, however, this generality \nshould not be mistaken for homogeneity. As we revealed in section 4, there are differ- \nent forms of devolution that arise from different legitimacy distributions. In this \nsection we reassess the implications of the trend in light of its virtual universality \nand complexity. \n \nFrom a strategic political perspective we should not be surprised to learn that \nawareness of the advantages of devolution tend to be more developed than awareness \nof its drawbacks.Whether devolution is driven mostly by national or subnational govern- \nments, each potential driver has an inherent interest in defending its policies to the \nelectorate and bolstering its legitimacy and popularity. The most common supporting \narguments for devolutionary policies draw upon the efficiency advantages that lower level \ngovernance can engender (Donahue, 1997; Keating, 1999; Oates, 1972; Tanzi, 1996, pages \n297 ^ 300). Given that the population in any country has a diverse preference structure, \nwhich varies across geographical space, this efficiency has three major sources, the themes \nof which recur time and again (Litvack et al, 1998, page 5; Oates, 1972). First, a smaller \ndemocratic and financial base should result in a managerial reform that will lead to a \nheightened degree of accountability, bolstered by the reduced administrative distance \nbetween the electorate and the politicians (Bennett, 1990; Hatry, 1994). Second, the lack \nof diluting influences\u00f6experienced by central government having responsibility for \nalternative, diverse regions\u00f6tends to allow local governments the flexibility to respond \nto the preferences of their `customers' or electorates (Bennett, 1990). Third, the local \nnature of governance implies a greater chance of the election of local politicians with \nthe specialist knowledge necessary to detect and react to the wishes of the electorate \nand defend its interests at higher levels (Putnam, 1993) as well as increasing the ability \nto implement policy innovations that would have been more difficult to pursue \nat the central or federal level (Bennett, 1990; Donahue, 1997). Devolutionists therefore \nacknowledge these three factors act both to ensure that local governments are \nmore representative of and responsive to the interests of a given locality or region \nand to allow them to fulful this role. Thus, public policy in general is brought closer \ninto line with the diverse preference sets of a nation, and welfare efficiency increases. \nMoreover, for those whose interests are not represented in their original location, \nthere is in theory an increasing opportunity to choose and move between regional \nand local governmental systems as devolution progresses and as the diversity of \npublic systems available to a nation as a whole increases. Arguments in favour \nof devolution are therefore underpinned by free-market assumptions, such as easy \nmobility, the politicoeconomic machinery of choice and democracy, and rational \nmodels of public sector behaviour under a democratic framework (see Tanzi, 1996, \npage 300). \n \nThere are areas, however, where developments associated with the global decentral- \nising trend we have identified above cast doubt on the picture of greater efficiency, \ngreater democracy, and greater welfare painted by devolutionists. As Prud'homme \n(1994, pages 1.2 ^ 1.3) outlines, the enthusiasm for devolution is driven not only by a \ncommonly ill-considered faith in economic arguments but also by considerations of \nstrategy on the part of ruling elites, the often `fashionable' aura surrounding the \nconcept of devolution, and the encouragement of international organisations, such as \ntheWorld Bank, whose support for devolution is at best based upon a `weak analytical \nbasis' (Prud'homme, 1995). Indeed, on such a basis, over 12% of all World Bank project \nactivity in 1998 included a decentralisation component (Litvack et al, 1998, page 1). The \nneed to expound the merits of caution with regard to devolution is therefore manifest. \nConsequently, in the following subsections, we explore some of the less encouraging \ndevelopments associated with devolution by focusing on three aspects\u00f6efficiency \nissues, equity issues, and administrative issues. \n \n5.1 Efficiency issues \n \n5.1.1 Devolution and debt \nAs discussed in earlier sections, devolutionary initiatives in our case-study countries \nhave often included some separation of responsibilities from resources. It is rare to find \nsimultaneous decentralisation of responsibility and resources, as the driving actor \nbehind devolutionary efforts will invariably have incentives to separate these two \nfactors one way or another (Rodden, 2002a, page 684; also, see figure 1). Under these \ncircumstances it is common to discover a mismatch between responsibilities and \nfinancing, which, as Bennett (1997, page 331) underlines, have inevitably led to the \ndevelopment of debts either at the central or at the local level, to a steady erosion of \nthe linkage of local decisions to their financial consequences, and to growing tension \nbetween central governments and subnational administrations. The cases of India, \nBrazil, and Spain illustrate various ways in which devolution can encourage debt \nformation. \n \nIn India, central government debt has been one of the major drivers behind \ndevolutionary efforts. Between 1980\/81 and 1993\/94 the internal debt of the central \ngovernment doubled, and total internal state debts rose from 4.6% to 7% of GDP \n(Buiter and Patel, 1997, page 36). It is easy, therefore, to envisage a situation where \nthe pressure on central government finances at least contributed to a decentralisation \nof expenditure responsibilities. With a strong centre and calls for greater regional \nautonomy, the temptation to engineer favourable forms of devolution that will assist \nin limiting the central deficit may well become overwhelming. \n \nIn cases where the states have played a key role in the decentralisation effort, the \ndecentralisation of resources can contribute towards large central deficits and devel- \noping regional debts\u00f6the former because of the de facto decentralisation of resources \nand the latter through the moral-hazard problem of central government effectively \nunderwriting the expenditure of regions [for a general exposition of this commitment \nproblem, see Rodden (2002a); for an examination of the Brazilian case, see Rodden \n(2002b)]. Perhaps the most apparent case of this type of development is found in Brazil. \nIn Brazil, where decentralisation initiatives have been driven more by the states than \nby the centre, states were allowed to accumulate huge debts, often resulting from the \ndevelopment of short-term populist policies by Brazilian governors, aimed at securing \ntheir grip on power (Dillinger and Webb, 1999; Rodr|\u00a8guez-Pose and Arbix, 2001). The \ngeneration of regional debts was traditionally perceived as a low-risk strategy by local \npoliticians, because, first, the burden of the debt would fall on future generations and \nnot on current voters and, second, states expected to be bailed out in the medium term \nby the federal government. This, in combination with a weak centre, the political \nsurvival of which during much of the second half of the 1990s depended on the support \nof regional politicians, created conditions where several Brazilian states defaulted on \ntheir debts (Rodden, 2002a, page 670). \n \nA devolutionary process driven by the so-called `historical' regions in Spain has led \nto the establishment of a system where, although in most regions regional finances are \nstill largely based on central government grants, autonomous regions hold the upper \nhand (Rodr|\u00a8guez-Pose, 1996). The consequence of this situation has been an erosion of \nnational control over regional spending and a weak fiscal accountability, leading to a \nspiralling of regional debt across Spain (Castells, 2001; Montero, 2001). \n \n5.1.2 Inefficient competition for industry \n \nAnother factor that threatens to proceed from efforts towards administrative devolu- \ntion concerns the phenomenon of territorial competition. The proliferation and greater \npowers of subnational governments are shifting the focus of development policies \naway from achieving greater equality or national cohesion, towards securing greater \neconomic efficiency at the local level (Cheshire and Gordon, 1998). Consequently, there \nhas been an increasing tendency for subnational governments to engage in competition \nfor the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) (Scott, 1998; Vernon, 1998). When \nsubnational governments offer incentives for mobile industry to locate within their \nregion, and the private sector firm chooses between the most attractive packages offered \nby the states, the impact upon national efficiency can be damaging. Cheshire and \nGordon (1996) conceptualise this situation in terms of a zero-sum game\u00f6one in which \nthe aggregate payoff of the game for all the actors involved is independent of the final \noutcome of the game across the actors. Specifically, the total gain of the arrival of a firm \nin a given country will be the same, or very similar, no matter where within the country \nthe firm chooses to locate. But there are costs involved in trying to affect the locational \ndecision of the firm that stem from the sort of measures offered to the mobile firms\u00f6 \nsuch as tax grants, incentives and subsidies, or specific policy arrangements for foreign \ninvestors\u00f6that contribute to the spiralling of subnational debt (Rodr|\u00a8guez-Pose and \nArbix, 2001). So, although the nation as a whole has nothing to gain as regions compete \nfor investment it has much to lose as competition for mobile investment increases and \nregional advertising and marketing, government grants and loans, and interest and debt \nconcessions increase. There are numerous examples of this sort of zero-sum competition \nfor industry across Europe and the USA (Donahue, 1997; Mytelka, 2000; Phelps and \nTewdwr-Jones, 2001) but it is perhaps in Brazil and China where the level of inefficiency \nassociated with this sort of territorial competition is more apparent. \n \nOf all the industries in Brazil, the automobile industry represents the clearest \nillustration of a general tendency. The Brazilian automobile industry expanded rapidly \nduring the relatively stable period between 1995 and 1999 at the start of President \nCardoso's term in office. During that time, car manufacturers invested over US $12 \nbillion in Brazil (Rodr|\u00a8guez-Pose and Arbix, 2001, page 134). Although this influx of \nFDI appears to be beneficial to the whole country, industrial mobility has created the \nconditions for fierce rivalry between Brazilian states hoping to attract investment and \nconsequently it has paved the way for wasteful expenditure designed to influence \ncompanies' locational decisions. As has been pointed out elsewhere, ``Tax and bidding \nwars have become the norm in the motor industry'' (Rodr|\u00a8guez-Pose and Arbix, 2001, \npage 145), with concessions routinely including the donation of land, the provision of \ninfrastructure, state and local tax breaks, loans, and a series of financial cautions and \nguarantees. \n \nIn China, a similar pattern of territorial competition has become commonplace. \nUnder the marketisation drive of the 1980s provinces, along with thousands of counties \nand townships, launched their `opening up' programmes with the establishment of \n`zones'. These were of differing varieties but each shared the common theme of offering \nsignificant concessions to attract industry, including, as a typical example, a 15% flat \nrate on corporation tax, a two-year tax exemption on profits, and a further three-year \n50% tax reduction. Ma (1996, page 15) documents the nature of these zones, which, by \nmid-1993, had swelled in number to around 1800 across China. Crucially, there were no \nofficial standards in the level of concessions that could be offered by the zones. The \nlack of an official standard of concessions has led to the development of intense \ncompetition, with concessions often extended well beyond the example above, towards \nextremes such as five tax-free years and a further five years of 50% tax payment. \nThe impact on China as a whole of the development of these zones may well have \nbeen detrimental, for the reasons Cheshire and Gordon (1996; 1998) provide. Ma \n(1996, page 15) points out that not only are concessions available to internationally \nfootloose companies but also to indigenous companies in an attempt to attract them \nfrom one region to another. No discernible national economic gain from the resources \nexpended on inducing these movements, which boil down to a simple spatial realloca- \ntion of industry within the nation, can be expected. Furthermore, McKenney (1993, \npages 20 ^ 21) points out that in Beijing, one of the richer and more tax-effective areas \nin China, the ability of the subnational government to extract the taxes rightfully owed \nto them in their economic zones has been extremely poor. All in all, although much \nindustry has been attracted to China through the use of economic zones, especially \nfrom Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, the efficiency cost through competitive \nconcession making across provinces detracts markedly from the advantages. \n \n5.2 Equity issues \n \nOne of the traditional roles of national government is the redistribution of resources in \norder to safeguard minimum levels of welfare throughout the country. Decentralisation \nof authority and resources undermines a central government's ability to achieve this, in \ntwo fundamental ways. First, devolution of decisionmaking authority progressively \ntransfers the responsibility for devising ways in which redistribution will occur to \nsubnational government. Second, this tier of government is multifarious, and it is often \nthe case that larger or more prosperous regions are overrepresented at this level. \nHence, following devolution, a smaller role for national transfers and a larger voice \nfor the regions in deciding how transfers are allocated is likely to result in a less \nprogressive system of fiscal redistribution than would be the case under a centralist \nsystem (Thompson, 1989) unless an explicit and transparent interterritorial fiscal \ntransfer system is established. The political and economic muscle of stronger regions is \nlikely to skew public expenditure in their favour, regardless of whether the greatest \nlegitimacy is based in the centre or in the regions and of whether the financing system \nof regions is based on local tax revenue or on grants from the centre.Where the finance \nsystem is locally based, the devolution of fiscal powers will inevitably favour wealthier \nareas, and where the finance system is centrally based the greater political muscle of \nlarger and richer regions may be reflected in a greater capacity to secure transfers from \nthe centre and to impede the evolution of a more centralised regional system of \ntransfers or regional policy, as Markusen (1994) demonstrated in the US case. \nIn figure 3 we illustrate the regressiveness of regional budgets in three of our case- \nstudy countries: Mexico, the USA, and Spain. The three cases represent three different \nforms of devolution and three different forms of regional financing, yet, in all cases, \nregions with the highest GDP per capita enjoy, as a general rule, a greater capacity for \nexpenditure than do poorer regions. The positive regression lines in the graphs confirm \nthis trend (figure 3). \n \n5.3 Institutional and political issues \n \nThree further issues concerning the understated downside of the devolutionary trend \noutlined in section 2 merit attention. First, and most obviously, devolution involves an \nincrease in the number and a decrease in the size of administrative units, with accom- \npanying costs. Second, more subtly, lobbying costs under a decentralised system are \nlikely to exceed those under a central system. In much the same way that regions \ncompete for mobile capital, subnational governmental units also compete for central \n \nFIGURE 3 HERE \n \nFigure 3. The regressiveness of regional budgets in 1999 in (a) Mexico, (b) the USA, and (c) Spain: \nexpenditure per capital (average . 100) in relation to GDP per capita (average . 100). \nThe global trend towards devolution and its implications 347 \n \nfinancial assistance (see Milgrom and Roberts, 1992), and, as for competitive bidding \nbetween regions, the expense incurred during the process of competition for govern- \nment financing is a deadweight loss to the nation as a whole. Moreover, we can expect \nthese losses to become greater as subnational governments become more powerful and \ncomplex. The proliferation of intragovernmental conventions and reviews of fiscal \nrelations\u00f6for example, in Brazil (1989), China (1994), and Mexico (1995)\u00f6underscore \nthe importance, complexity, and expense associated with public redistribution. Third, \ndevolution of authority carries with it the threat of increased corruption (Rodden, \n2002a, page 684). As Prud'homme (1994, pages 2.17 ^ 2.21) points out, although corrup- \ntion is hard to measure, several reasons can be given for suspecting corruption rates to \nbe higher at local levels. On the one hand, more opportunities for corruption probably \nexist, along with greater pressure from interest groups resulting from their proximity to \nlocal decisionmakers. On the other hand, fewer obstacles exist to prevent corruption. \nLocal officials typically enjoy more discretion over funds than do those at the national \nlevel as well as more long-standing and personal relationships with stakeholders, creat- \ning the conditions for unethical relations that are promoted further by a relative lack of \nmedia scrutiny at lower governmental levels (Prud'homme, 1995). Furthermore, in \nTanzi's (1996, page 301) view, contiguity\u00f6the fact that officials and citizens live and \nwork close to one another and have often known each other for some time and may \neven be related\u00f6serves to undermine the ethics of local governmental institutions. \n \n6 Conclusions \n \nThe purpose of this paper has been to bring to attention the general trend in \ndecentralisation and to outline the complexity of its forms and implications. To this \nend, some of the key issues surrounding the mechanisms of devolution were addressed \nand incorporated into an informal model at the start of the paper. In this model we \nidentified three factors of decentralisation as composing the devolutionary trend\u00f6 \nlegitimacy, and the decentralisation of resources and authority. Some of the interest \nconflicts arising from the coexistence of these attributes of devolution were addressed \nin order to deepen our understanding of devolutionary mechanics. The relevance of \nthis understanding became clear in section 3, in which we outlined the depth and \nbreadth of the global trend towards devolution. In those countries with centralised \nsystems twenty or thirty years ago, decentralisation has been widespread, and in those \ncountries with initially more vertically dispersed government systems further decentral- \nisation from their respective starting points has become the norm. This global tendency \ntowards the devolution of authority and resources elevates the importance of the need \nto understand this phenomenon. To this end, in section 4 the theoretical arguments \ngiven in section 2 were then applied to our group of case-study countries, exposing the \ndiversity of devolutionary efforts across the globe. \n \nIn section 5, given the understated heterogeneity of devolutionary processes, the \nparallel heterogeneity of devolutionary implications was addressed. The expectation \nthat devolution leads to greater efficiency, as the devolutionists and many policymakers \nappear to hold, can be called into question on the grounds that the process tends \nto engender both debt and territorial competition which are harmful to national \nefficiency. The gains from devolution through the matching of public services to a \nheterogeneous population preference structure is a static argument that may overlook \ndynamic alterations in the behaviour of the actors involved. From either perspective, \nthe incentive structure facing the national and subnational governments alter and \npresent the potential for opportunistic interaction that is damaging for the economy \nas a whole. Although the matching argument remains strong it should be weighted \nagainst the expected losses resulting from these factors before any devolutionary \nprocesses are undertaken. \n \nIn terms of equity, evidence was present to support the case that decentralisation \nof resources is often regressive from a territorial point of view. The combination of \ndwindling central government outlays in relative terms with the greater bargaining \npower of the richer and\/or larger subnational authorities frequently leaves weaker \nand poorer regions in a worse financial state than under a centralised system. In \nsection 5 we provided a brief discussion of the administrative, lobbying, and corruption \ncosts that devolution is also likely to entail. \n \nIn summary, it is imperative for policymakers to recognise varying forms of \ndecentralisation and to be aware of the vested interests of national and subnational \ngovernments across these alternative devolutionary forms. It is also imperative that \ncommentators, policymakers, and analysts remain aware of the context of debates and \nopinions surrounding devolution. It is no coincidence that devolution tends to be \nsupported by national electorates, because powerful and influential actors seek to \nmuster the support of the electorate to facilitate their own initiatives. At the same \ntime, however, this situation might well be damaging if enthusiasm for devolution is \nnot tempered with, first, an awareness of the context of any debates that occur and, \nsecond, an awareness of not just the benefits but also the understated drawbacks that \ndevolution can engender. As Tanzi (1996, page 314) has emphasised, successful devolu- \ntion is highly dependent upon a long list of preexistent circumstances, the generation \nand, equally, consideration of which are by no means assured. The prescription of this \npaper is therefore cautionary with respect to both the interpretation and the promotion \nof devolutionary efforts. \n \nAcknowledgements.
