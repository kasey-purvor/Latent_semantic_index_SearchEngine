They\nare free of magnetic fields and surface boundary layers and\nso have the simplest possible accretion flow. Many of these\nsystems are also transient, showing huge X\u2013ray outbursts\nwhere the luminosity rises by many orders of magnitude over\na short time and then fades away more slowly. The evolution\nof their spectra and variability during these outbursts can\nbe used to determine the nature of the accretion flow as a\nfunction of mass accretion rate onto the central object.\nIt is now generally believed that the outbursts are\ncaused by a classic disk instability. In quiescence the ma-\nterial in the disk is cool, so the sound speed is slow, and\nthe mass accretion rate through the disk is smaller than the\nmass transfer rate from the companion star. The material\nthen builds up on the outer edge of the disk and the structure\nis very different from that of a steady state disk (Shakura\n& Sunyaev 1973, hereafter SS). When the local temperature\nin any part of this quiescent disk reaches \u223c 104K, hydrogen\nbegins to ionize. This results in a sudden increase in opac-\nity, causing an increase in temperature and the local sound\nspeed, and so giving an increase in local mass accretion rate.\nThe disk interior to this point then receives this higher mass\naccretion rate, which can trigger a heating wave that prop-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 Colin D. Wilson and C. Done\nagates inwards (and outwards). This switches the disk into\nthe hot state, which is well described by an SS disk but\nwith a mass accretion rate which is much higher than that\nfrom the companion star. Over time, this depletes the disk,\ndraining it sufficiently to switch back into the cool state (see\ne.g the review by Osaki 1996, with applications to the black\nhole transients in King & Ritter 1998).\nThis picture fails to explain the observed spectra during\nboth outburst and quiescence. The SS disk models assume\nthat the gravitational potential energy of the accreting mat-\nter is dissipated in optically thick material, so it thermalizes\nwith a maximum temperature of \u223c 1 keV. In quiescence\nthe disk is very cool, \u223c 4000 K independent of radius (e.g.\nCannizzo 1998), and so emits no high energy flux. Yet ob-\nservations show that these systems generically produce hard\nX\u2013ray emission. At high mass accretion rates (approaching\nEddington) the spectra are dominated by a soft component\nat kT \u223c 1 keV with a strongly (very high state: VHS) or\nweakly (high state: HS) Comptonized component (which is\noccasionally below the detection limit). The Comptonized\ncomponent forms a rather steep power law tail (\u0393 \u223c 2 \u2212 3)\nwhich extends out beyond 511 keV in the few objects with\ngood high energy data (Grove et al. 1998). At lower mass\naccretion rates, below \u223c 5 per cent of Eddington, there is\na rather abrupt transition when the soft component drops\nin temperature and luminosity. Instead this (low state: LS)\nspectrum is dominated by thermal Comptonization, with\n\u0393 < 1.9, rolling over at energies of \u223c 150 keV (see e.g. the\nreviews by Tanaka & Lewin 1995; van der Klis 1995; Nowak\n1995). At even lower luminosities, during quiescence, there\nis weak hard X\u2013ray emission which appears to be similar to\nthe LS spectrum (e.g. Kong et al. 2000).\nThere are several possible ways to produce the hard X\u2013\nrays, but all require that some fraction of the accretion en-\nergy is dissipated in an optically thin environment. The two\nmain candidates currently considered are magnetic flares\nabove the disk, generated by the Balbus\u2013Hawley MHD dy-\nnamo responsible for the disk viscosity, or that the inner\ndisk is replaced by an optically thin, X\u2013ray hot accretion\nflow. Little is known about the spectrum expected from elec-\ntrons heated through magnetic reconnection, but the ob-\nserved weak disk emission in the LS can be explained if\nmost of the viscous dissipation is released in a patchy or\nout-flowing magnetic corona (Svensson & Zdziarski 1994;\nStern et al. 1995; Beloborodov 1999). By contrast, the prop-\nerties of an optically thin accretion flow can be worked out in\nsome detail, typically giving electron temperatures of \u223c 100\nkeV (cooling dominated by radiation: Shapiro, Lightman &\nEardley 1976; or advection: Narayan & Yi 1996). These can\nexist only at fairly low mass accretion rates as they rely cru-\ncially on the assumption that the accretion energy is given\nmainly to the protons, and that the electrons are only heated\nvia Coulomb collisions. At high densities (i.e. high mass ac-\ncretion rates) then the electrons efficiently drain energy from\nthe protons and the flow collapses back into an SS disk.\nHence these flows can contribute only to the hard X\u2013rays\nin LS or quiescent emission. The collapse of such flows may\ngive the physical mechanism for the LS\/VHS state transi-\ntion (Esin, McClintock & Narayan 1997). In the HS and\nVHS then magnetic reconnection is an obvious candidate\nfor the X\u2013ray tail. However, there is also a radio jet\/outflow\nseen in the LS and VHS which may also play a role in the\nX\u2013ray emission (Fender 2000).\nIn summary, for quiescence and LS there are two po-\ntential mechanisms for the hard X\u2013ray production. One of\nthese has a truncated disk, and an inner optically thin, hot\nflow, while the other has a (steady state or quiescent) disk\nwhich extends down to the last stable orbit. If there is a\ntruncated disk in quiescence\/LS, then the disk material has\nto move in order to give the HS and VHS spectra which are\ndominated by emission from an optically thick, inner disk.\nData from the rise to outburst of a GBHC transient would\nthen give one of the best diagnostics of the nature of the\naccretion flow as the majority of the disk material is known\nto be moving inwards in this phase.\nSuch data have only recently become possible with the\nrapid response of the RXTE satellite. RXTE J1550\u2013564 is\nthe first GBHC to be intensively observed during its rise\nto outburst phase, as well as its decline, giving unprece-\ndented coverage of the X\u2013ray spectrum over a huge range in\nmass accretion rate. These data give several ways to observa-\ntionally track the disk. Firstly there are the Quasi\u2013Periodic\nOscillations (QPO\u2019s) seen in the X\u2013ray spectra. While the\norigin of these are not well understood, all QPO models use\na characteristic radius (this radius is a local change in disk\nproperties and is sometimes associated with the inner edge\nof an SS disk, e.g Psaltis & Norman 2001). For the QPO fre-\nquency to change then requires that this radius is not fixed\nat the last stable orbit of 6Rg (where Rg = GM\/c\n2). RXTE\nJ1550\u2013564 shows a dramatic increase in QPO frequency dur-\ning the rise, by a factor of \u223c 50 (Cui et al. 1999, Remillard\net al. 1999), most probably indicating that the transition\nradius (or SS disk radius) is moving inwards during the rise\n(di Matteo & Psaltis 1999)\nA second way to track the inner disk is to use X\u2013ray\nreflection. Hard X\u2013rays illuminating optically thick mate-\nrial give rise to a Compton reflection component and associ-\nated iron fluorescence line (Lightman & White 1988; George\n& Fabian 1991; Matt, Perola & Piro 1991). These features\nare smeared by special and general relativistic effects of the\nmotion of the disk in the deep gravitational potential well\n(Fabian et al. 1989). The amount of reflection gives the solid\nangle of the optically thick disk as observed from the hard\nX\u2013ray source, while the amount of smearing shows how far\nthe material extends into the gravitational potential of the\nblack hole.\nHere we analyze the detailed spectral properties during\nthe rise phase. The 3-200 keV spectral changes during this\ntime are shown in Figure 1. The 2\u201320 keV spectrum showed\na dramatic softening during the rise (See the light curve\nand hardness ratio plots in Sobczak et al. 1999), concurrent\nwith a change in the variability power spectrum (Cui et al.\n1999). Taken together, these imply a LS\/VHS state tran-\nsition during the rise. We examine the PCA and HEXTE\nspectra, showing that the broadband continuum is indeed\nconsistent with a LS\/VHS transition, and identify a smeared\nreflected component in all the spectra. For the LS, the re-\nflection signature is similar to that seen in other LS spectra,\ni.e. reflection from mainly neutral material, which subtends\na solid angle of substantially less than 2pi and is broadened,\nbut not by as much as expected if the reflecting material ex-\ntended down to the last stable orbit (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1997;\nZ\u02d9ycki, Done & Smith 1997; Done & Z\u02d9ycki 1999; Gilfanov\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nJ1550\u2013564 3\net al. 1999; Zdziarski, Lubin\u00b4ski & Smith 1999). Given that\nboth the disk instability model and QPO data imply a trun-\ncated SS disk at this point then this strongly favours models\nwhich identify the LS with a truncated disk, and rules out\nmodels which require an inner disk (of the Shakura and Sun-\nyaev form) for the source of the hard X\u2013ray emission in the\nLS.\n2 THE RISE TO OUTBURST DATA FROM\nRXTE J1550\u2013564\nCalibration issues are important in any detailed spectral\nanalysis. We have attempted to quantify these by analyzing\na Crab spectrum taken contemporaneously with the RXTE\nJ1550\u2013564 rise data. The Crab spectrum is complex, since it\ncontains both the nebula and pulsar components. The syn-\nchrotron nebula gives a spectrum which is approximately\na power law (\u0393 = 2.3) in the 3\u201320 keV band, although\nthere is subtle spectral curvature over a wider bandpass (e.g.\nAtoyan & Aharonian 1996). The pulsar spectrum is gener-\nically harder but has stronger curvature and is phase vari-\nable. It is consequently only approximately a power law over\na rather restricted energy band (see e.g. Pravdo, Angelini &\nHarding 1997; Massaro et al. 2000 and references therein).\nWe approximate the total spectrum in the 3\u201320 keV range\nby two power laws, representing the nebula and pulsar, re-\nspectively. We fix the pulsar component to a spectral index\nof \u0393 = 1.8 and its flux at 10\u201320 % of that of the nebula, and\nobtain a good fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.2 \u2212 1.0) using only the top layers\nfrom detectors 0 and 1, with 0.5% systematic errors.\nGiven the complex nature of the total emission from the\nCrab, the HEXTE data should not lie on a single power law\nextrapolation of the PCA. This is an important point, since\nthis \u2018discrepancy\u2019 has been used to argue that the PCA\u2013\nHEXTE cross calibration is unreliable (Sobczak et al. 1999).\nWhile work on the cross calibration is still ongoing, there\nis currently no reason not to fit the two datasets together,\nallowing for a normalization offset.\nWe have used the public RXTE dataset 30188-06,\nwhich traces the rise of the outburst from 07\/09\/98 to\nthe 16\/09\/98. The PCA (detectors 0,1 top layer only) and\nHEXTE (detector 0 only) data were extracted using the\nREX script in FTOOLS 5.0. Systematic errors of 0.5% were\nadded to all the PCA spectra. Selected spectra from the rise\nare shown in Figure 1, showing the dramatic spectral soft-\nening. Although the 2-10 keV light curve of the ASM shows\na spectacular increase in luminosity (a factor of \u223c 7), figure\n1 shows that this is a bandpass effect caused by ignoring the\nhigher energies. The estimated bolometric luminosity only\nincreases by a factor of \u223c 2.\n3 MODEL DESCRIPTION\nWe analyzed the spectra using the XSPEC spectral fitting\npackage (Arnaud 1996) v10.0. The spectrum is expected\nto contain soft emission from the accretion disk, which we\nmodel using the diskbb and hard emission from Comp-\nton scattering of these soft seed photons by energetic elec-\ntrons. A power law with exponential rollover at the elec-\ntron energy is often used to approximate this, but it seri-\nFigure 1. The spectral transition of XTE J1550\u2013564 from\nlow\/hard to very high state.\nously overestimates the Comptonized flux at energies close\nto those of the seed photons, and underestimates it below\nthe cutoff. This renders most parameters derived from such\nmodels unreliable. Instead we use an approximate solution\nfor thermal Comptonization based on Kompaneets\u2019 equa-\ntion (thComp: Zdziarski, Johnson & Magdziarz 1996). In-\nherent limitations on the Kompaneets\u2019 equation mean that\nthis solution becomes inaccurate at optical depths < 1 and\ntemperatures above > 100 keV. The Comptonized spec-\ntrum can illuminate the accretion disk, giving rise to a re-\nflected (reprocessed) component. Both the continuum reflec-\ntion (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995) and iron emission line\nare calculated self\u2013consistently for a given ionization state\n(Z\u02d9ycki & Czerny 1994), and the total reprocessed spectrum\nis then relativistically smeared by convolving it with the\ndiskline model of Fabian et al. (1989) including correc-\ntions for light bending. The reflected spectrum is then de-\ntermined by the solid angle of the reflector as seen from the\nX\u2013ray source, \u2126, normalized to 2pi, its inclination i, ioniza-\ntion parameter, \u03be = 4piFX\/n (where FX is the illuminating\nflux and n = number density), and inner disk radius, Rin\n(see Z\u02d9ycki ,Done and Smith 1999 for model details). The\nabundances of Morrison & McCammon (1983) are used.\nThere are as yet no good determinations of inclination\nof the system, so we fix this at 30\u25e6. The distance is also fairly\nuncertain, but E(B\u2013V)\u223c 0.7 measured from optical spectra\nsuggests 2.5 kpc (Sanchez\u2013Fernandez et al. 1999).

Done\n4 RESULTS\n4.1 Initial spectrum\nThe PCA data alone cannot be well fit by a thermal\nComptonization continuum and disk blackbody spectrum\n(\u03c72\u03bd = 304.3\/40). Including a reflected spectrum and its\nassociated iron fluorescence line gives a good fit to the\ndata (\u03c72\u03bd = 43.0\/38), but this is further significantly im-\nproved by including relativistic smearing (\u03c72\u03bd = 37.1\/37, for\nRin = 26\n+63\n\u221215). The reflected fraction is \u2126\/2pi = 0.24\n+0.03\n\u22120.04\nfrom mainly neutral material, \u03be = 16+23\u22125 . The disk black-\nbody is not significantly detected in the spectrum, and as-\nsuming that it provides the soft photons for the thermal\nComptonization gives a limit on its temperature of \u2264 0.5\nkeV).\nThese findings are qualitatively different to those de-\nrived from using more approximate spectral models. The\noften used continuum of a disk blackbody and power law,\ntogether with a broad Gaussian line and smeared edge to\nphenomenologically model the reflected spectral features (as\nused for later parts of the outburst in Sobczak et al. 1999)\ngives a comparably good fit if the column is allowed to be\nfree (\u03c72\u03bd = 26.0\/36). With this model the disk blackbody is\nrequired, and has kT = 0.75+0.12\n\u22120.11 keV. We strongly caution\nagainst using parameters derived from such phenomenolog-\nical fits to derive physical quantities such as disk radii (see\nalso the detailed criticism of the diskbb model of Merloni,\nFabian & Ross 2000).\nThe model is further constrained if the HEXTE data\n(30\u2013200 keV) is used as the electron temperature can be\ndetermined from the high energy rollover in the spectrum.\nA single thermal Comptonization model (with its relativis-\ntic reflection) can fit both PCA and HEXTE data (\u03c72\u03bd =\n71.5\/75), as shown in the upper panel of figure 2. The re-\nflection parameters remain similar to those derived from\nthe PCA data alone, Rin = 26\n+48\n\u221214, \u2126\/2pi = 0.25\n+0.04\n\u22120.03 and\n\u03be = 14+26\n\u22128 . However, the broad bandpass covered also shows\nevidence for subtle spectral curvature which can be mod-\nelled by including a second Comptonized component. This\ngives a significantly better fit and is shown in the lower panel\n(\u03c72\u03bd = 51.5\/72) but for rather different reflected parameters\n(\u2126\/2pi = 0.0825+0.05\u22120.05 , \u03be = 352\n+9000\n\u2212280 and Rin = 20\n+31\n\u221210 Rg).\nThe second Compton component has a shape which is clearly\nrather similar to a reflection hump, so if this is the shape\nof the continuum then it significantly reduces the derived\nreflected fraction.\nWhile this spectral curvature is significantly detected\nit does not necessarily mean that the continuum is truly\ndescribed by a two (or multi\u2013) temperature form. Firstly,\nit could artifact of residual cross\u2013calibration uncertainties\nbetween the PCA and HEXTE instruments (although the\nspectral curvature is marginally detected in the PCA data\nalone: including a second Comptonized component (with\nits reflection tied to that of the first Comptonized spec-\ntrum) gives a reduction in \u03c72\u03bd to 27.3\/34). It could also\nindicate that the reflected spectral models used here un-\nderestimate the Compton reflection hump, such as might be\nexpected if there was an ionized skin overlying a neutral disk\nwhich produced Compton reflection but no spectral features\n(Nayakshin, Kazanas & Kallman 2000, Done & Nayakshin\n2001). Alternatively there can be complex curvature in a\nComptonized spectrum due to the visibility of the individual\nFigure 2.

This does not include the self\u2013consistent line emis-\nsion for the reflection spectrum, so the line is included as a\ndiskline with free energy and normalisation. This gives a\ncomparable fit to the PCA plus HEXTE data as the single\nthComp model \u03c72\u03bd = 60.1\/73, with \u2126\/2pi = 0.26 and \u03be = 62\ni.e. for similar reflected parameters to the single Compton\ncomponent model.\nHowever the initial spectrum is modelled, it is very sim-\nilar to the classic Low State spectra seen in many Galactic\nBlack Holes (little or no Black Body and a large Comp-\nton component). The power spectrum of these data shown\nby Cui et al. (1999) is also very similar to low\/hard state\npower spectra (e.g. van der Klis 1995), being flat below \u223c 0.1\nHz, breaking to \u223c f\u22121, and then to \u223c f\u22122 above \u223c 10 Hz,\nwith a high fractional r.m.s. amplitude of \u223c 30%. Compar-\ning these with the compilation of RXTE Cyg X\u20131 data of\nGilfanov, Churazov & Revnivtsev (1999) shows that both\nspectrum and variability are typical of Cyg X\u20131 in its hard-\nest low\/hard state observed by RXTE.\nWe illustrate this spectrally by showing the hard-\nest low\/hard spectrum of the RXTE Cyg X\u20131 observa-\ntion (10238-01-03-00), extracted identically to the J1550\u2013\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nJ1550\u2013564 5\nFigure 3.

We fit this to the same spectral model of a\ndisk black body and two Comptonized continua (together\nwith their reflected emission). This gives an excellent fit,\nwith \u03c72\u03bd = 74.6\/72. Figure 3 shows this with the data\nfrom RXTE J1550\u2013564 over-plotted. Again, the spectrum is\nslightly curved: a single Compton continuum and its reflec-\ntion gives a significantly worse fit (\u03c72\u03bd = 88.9\/75), although\nagain this could be due to the same cross-calibration uncer-\ntainties rather than necessarily pointing to a more complex\ncontinuum or reflected spectrum. Even the normalizations\nare similar, assuming that they are both at similar distances\n(Cyg X\u20131 is at \u223c 2 kpc: Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999). We conclude\nthat in the first part of the rise then RXTE J1550\u2013564 was\nin a classic LS.\n4.2 Final spectrum\nThe model which provided an acceptable fit to the LS\nPCA data (disk blackbody as seed photons for thermal\nComptonization and its reflected spectrum with relativistic\nsmearing) also gives an adequate fit to the final spectrum\n(\u03c72\u03bd = 44.4\/37) but with very different parameters. The disk\nblackbody is now significantly detected, with kT \u223c 0.7 keV,\nand there is significant spectral curvature in the PCA spec-\ntrum which causes the derived electron temperature to be\n\u223c 19 keV, much lower than the LS. The ionization state\nof the reflector is now extremely high, \u03be \u223c 3 \u00d7 103. The\nphenomenological model (a disk black body and powerlaw)\ngives a statistically similar fit, \u03c72\u03bd = 43.1\/36, with seed pho-\nton temperature kT \u223c 0.6 keV. Including the HEXTE data\nshows that the phenomenological model is inadequate. A \u03c72\u03bd\nof 328.0\/74 is found although this drops to \u03c72\u03bd = 70.4\/72\nwith an exponential rollover in the continuum.\nThe single Comptonized component and its reflection\n(with a disk blackbody from the accretion disk) can fit\nthe PCA and HEXTE data adequately (\u03c72\u03bd = 89.1\/75),\nwith \u2126\/2pi = 0.11, \u03be = 2.6 \u00d7 103 and Rin = 15Rg. Once\nagain there are hints of spectral curvature. Using a sec-\nond Compton component again gives a (marginally signif-\nFigure 4.

However, this time the reflection parameters are ro-\nbust to changes in the spectral form, with \u2126\/2pi = 0.12,\n\u03be = 2.5 \u00d7 103 and Rin = 18Rg for the two thComp contin-\nuum, and \u2126\/2pi = 0.15, \u03be = 8.2 \u00d7 103 and Rin = 13Rg for\na single CompPS continuum.\nThe two temperature model continuum is gives a com-\nbination of low energy curvature with a high energy tail\nwhich is very similar to that seen in Cyg X\u20131 in its high state\n(Poutanen & Coppi 1998; Coppi 1999; Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999),\nthe difference here being that low temperature Comptonized\nemission is much stronger in RXTE J1550\u2013564 (thus making\nthe disk emission less obviously dominant) than in the HS\nof Cyg X\u20131. This, together with its power spectrum (Cui et\nal. 1999) clearly show that by the end of slow rise RXTE\nJ1550\u2013564 is in the very high state. The classic high\/soft\nstate (defined as that which contains a dominant black body\nspectrum and little or no Comptonized component) is never\nencountered during the rise, and the spectral transition is\nfrom LS to VHS.\n4.3 Intermediate Data\nAny system of models must be able to fit all the data, so\nhere we look at a spectrum taken from the middle of the rise\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 Colin D. Wilson and C. Done\nFigure 5. The spectra of J1550\u2013564 in an intermediate state fit\nwith a disk black body and one thermal Compton component\n(top panel) and with two thermal Compton components (bottom\npanel).\n(spectrum number 3), where the hardness ratio clearly indi-\ncates that the source is in transition. A single Compton com-\nponent model using the PCA data alone gives \u03c72\u03bd = 27.0\/37\nwith \u2126\/2pi = 0.07, \u03be = 7 \u00d7 103, and Rin = 45Rg, but in-\ncluding the HEXTE data gives 225.2\/75, a completely inad-\nequate fit. The curvature is not well modeled even by CompPS\nwhich gives \u03c72\u03bd = 129\/73. The two component Comptoniza-\ntion model is the only one which gives a good fit to the\nbroad band data (\u03c72\u03bd = 66\/75), as shown in Figure 5. The\nreflection parameters are then similar to those derived from\nthe PCA data alone with \u2126\/2pi = 0.06, \u03be = 7.1 \u00d7 103, and\nRin = 41Rg. The nature of the spectral curvature is now not\nat all subtle, and the spectrum clearly shows that there is a\nlow temperature, curving component in the PCA, together\nwith rather higher temperature emission which dominates\nthe HEXTE band. In the final spectrum the lower temper-\nature component is somewhat hotter and dominates more\nof the high energy spectrum, making the single temperature\nmodels an adequate description.\n4.4 All Data\nWe are interested in how the reflected spectrum varies dur-\ning the transition, yet the previous sections have shown that\nthese are not always robust to changing the continuum spec-\ntral form. Accordingly we give results for two set of spec-\ntral fits. In the first we assume that the HEXTE cross\u2013\ncalibration is reliable and fit all the rise PCA\/HEXTE spec-\ntra with a model consisting of seed disk blackbody photons,\ntogether with two thermal Compton continua and their rel-\nativistically smeared reflection (Table 1). The last column\nof Table 1 gives the \u03c72\u03bd for a single Compton continuum\nmodel to the PCA\/HEXTE data, showing that it cannot ac-\nceptably fit most of the intermediate spectra (see previous\nsection). The second set of fits assumes that the HEXTE\ncross\u2013calibration is not reliable at this level and so uses\nonly the PCA data with a model of seed disk blackbody\nphotons, a single temperature thermal Compton continuum\nand its relativistically smeared reflection (Table 2). Given\nthe uncertainty on the continuum model (and the fact that\nthe temperatures derived from thComp are inaccurate above\n\u223c 50 keV) we show spectral evolution by the changing hard-\nness ratio of the PCA data.\nFor the single temperature continuum fits to the PCA\ndata the onset of the LS\u2013VHS transition is marked by an\nincrease in ionization state of the reflector from \u223c 20 to \u223c\n5000 and a decrease in the solid angle subtended by the disk,\nfrom \u2126\/2pi \u223c 0.25\u22120.12. Apart from this jump at spectrum\n3 the parameters are remarkably stable throughout large\nchanges in spectral form. This stability is even more marked\nin the two temperature PCA\/HEXTE fits. There is some\nindication of a jump in ionization at spectrum 3, at the onset\nof the LS\u2013VHS transition, though it is less significant due\nto the larger error bars on the reflection parameters from\nthe LS data. However, there is no evidence for any change\nin the solid angle.\nIonization and the amount of reflection are correlated in\nthe fits. As the ionization increases the photoelectric opacity\ndecreases, so there is more reflected continuum below \u223c 15\nkeV. The spectral features (line and edge) shift to higher\nenergies, and their contrast with respect to the continuum\nincreases (although this also depends on the hardness of\nthe illuminating continuum). In general the line increases\nby more than the edge as the fluorescence yield increases\nwith ionization state (see e.g. Ross & Fabian 1993; Z\u02d9ycki\n& Czerny 1994 for photo\u2013ionized reflected spectra). Figure\n6 shows the residuals to the best fit continuum only model\n(disk blackbody and single thermal Compton spectrum but\nno reflection) to the data before and after the transition\n(PCA spectra 1 and 5). There is clearly more line and its\nmean energy has shifted up, indicating ionization. The edge\nenergy has also increased, but its strength has not. While\nionization predicts that the line should increase by more\nthan the edge, the edge depth should also increase if the\nsolid angle remains the same. So to get increasing ioniza-\ntion with the same edge depth requires that the solid angle\ndecreases.\nThe evolution of the reflector parameters during the rise\nis shown in Figure 7. Irrespective of the continuum model\nused, the derived amount of reflection is always significantly\nless than unity, while the amount of relativistic smearing\n(while always significant although with large error bars) is\nnever as large as that expected for a disk extending down\nto the last stable orbit in a Schwarzchild geometry.\nIf the single Comptonized component is the correct\nmodel for the hard spectrum in the low state then there\nis a sharp increase in ionization state, coupled with a de-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nJ1550\u2013564 7\nTable 1.

The first is that the accretion\ndisk truncates, forming an inner, optically thin, X\u2013ray hot\naccretion flow, while the second postulates magnetic flares\nabove a disk. We review here the very different predictions\nof these models for how the X\u2013ray emitting region evolves\nduring the rise to outburst, but show that both can give the\nobserved LS spectrum.\n5.1 Truncated disk with an inner, X\u2013ray hot flow\nThe geometry of a truncated disk and inner, X\u2013ray hot flow\ncan plainly explain the weak disk emission, hard (photon\u2013\nstarved) X\u2013ray spectrum, and generally low amplitude of X\u2013\nray reflection seen in the LS (e.g. Poutanen, Krolik & Ryde\n1997). Certainly in quiescence it seems very likely that the\ndisk structure does not extend all the way down to the last\nstable orbit. Firstly, the observed X\u2013ray luminosity, while\nlow, still implies a mass accretion rate which is too high for\nthe inner disk to remain below the instability threshold i.e.\nto be quiescent. A disk which truncates at larger radii can\ncarry this mass accretion rate without triggering the insta-\nbility (Lasota et al. 1996). Also, the inner regions of a quies-\ncent disk structure are generally optically thin to both true\nabsorption and electron scattering (see e.g. Cannizzo 1998).\nSuch material cannot cool efficiently, so will heat up. Con-\nduction between this and the remaining quiescent disk can\nlead to progressive evaporation of the inner regions of the\nquiescent disk into a hot flow (Meyer & Meyer\u2013Hofmeister\n1994; Meyer\u2013Hofmeister & Meyer 1999). Conduction from a\nhot flow can lead to evaporation of even an SS disk, so this\ncan be a mechanism to truncate the disk even at the much\nhigher mass accretion rates generally seen for the LS emis-\nsion (Ro\u00b4z\u02d9an\u00b4ska & Czerny 2000).

However, at a certain critical mass accretion\nrate, the density is such that electron\u2013ion collisions become\nfrequent, so the electrons gain most of the ion energy. The\nadvected fraction becomes small and the ADAF collapses\ninto a standard SS disk. This predicts that the LS will end\nat accretion rates of m\u02d9 \u223c 1.3\u03b12 (Where m\u02d9 = M\u02d9\/M\u02d9Edd,\nand M\u02d9Edd = 10LEdd\/c\n2). This corresponds to luminosities\nof 1 \u2212 8% of Eddington for a viscosity of \u03b1 = 0.1 \u2212 0.3, as\naround a third of the energy is advected rather than radiated\nat these densities (Esin et al. 1997; Quataert & Narayan\n1999). At these high viscosities the flows are also stable to\nconvection (Narayan, Igumenshchev & Abramowicz 2000).\nThese models predict \u2126\/2pi < 1 as the ADAF is cen-\ntrally concentrated, so the solid angle subtended by the disk\nis fairly small (Esin et al. 1997). However, more detailed\npredictions are difficult as they critically depend on the ge-\nometry at the transition between the disk and ADAF. Cur-\nrent models generally assume a transition radius of \u223c 1000\nSchwarzchild radii, and these give LS spectra which have\n\u2126\/2pi << 1 (Esin et al. 1997) and very little relativistic\nsmearing. Previous observations of 2\u201320 keV LS spectra\nshow \u2126\/2pi \u223c 0.3 (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1997; Z\u02d9ycki et al. 1997;\n1998; Gilfanov et al. 1999), and smearing characteristic of\nan inner radius of 10\u201320 Schwarzchild radii (Z\u02d9ycki et al.\n1997; 1998; 1999; Done & Z\u02d9ycki 1999). These are incompat-\nible with a disk truncated at 1000 Schwarzchild radii. While\nboth the solid angle and smearing can match the observa-\ntions by simply decreasing the transition radius between the\nADAF and the cold disk, this is not a completely free pa-\nrameter. A small transition radius gives rise to a strong disk\nflux which Compton cools the ADAF, and can lead to its\ncollapse (Esin 1997). A transition at 10 Schwarzchild radii\ndecreases the maximum ADAF luminosity by a factor of\n\u223c 2, making it only just feasible to get the observed LS lu-\nminosity of \u223c 3% of Eddington (Esin et al. 1997; Gierlin\u00b4ski\net al. 1999). However, these problems disappear entirely if\nthe PCA\/HEXTE cross\u2013calibration spectra is reliable. Con-\ntinuum curvature can give an overestimate of the amount of\nreflection present in single temperature\/power law fits to low\nenergy (\u2264 20 keV) spectra (compare Tables 1 and 2 for the\nLS spectra).\nThe inner radius of most of the disk material is almost\ncertainly moving during the rise to outburst, If the edge of\nthe ADAF follows the inner radius of the heating wave (i.e.\nthe inner radius of the SS part of the disk), then the reflected\nfraction should be small and remain fairly constant. Alter-\nnatively, if the disk penetrates some way into the ADAF,\n\u2126\/2pi is rather larger and can increase or remain constant\nas the heating wave moves inwards, depending on the de-\ntails of the geometry. Both of these options are consistent\nwith our derived model parameters, as our data do not cover\nmuch of the LS evolution.\nWhile this gives continuity of properties between the\nquiescent and LS spectra, there should be an abrupt change\nwhen the ADAF finally collapses into whatever very different\nmechanism powers the LS\/VHS emission. The viscous time-\nscale for a quasi\u2013spherical flow to collapse is only \u223c 1\/\u03b1\u00d7\nlonger than the dynamical time-scale at a given radius i.e.\nmuch less than a second for a flow of 10Rs around a 10M\u2299\nblack hole. However, the collapse might be triggered locally\nby the disk underneath the hot flow, in which case it will be\ndetermined by the viscous time-scale for the SS disk, which\nis \u223c a few hours for the same parameters. This is still a much\nshorter than the observed \u223c 3 day time-scale for the spec-\ntral transition (see Figure 1), although evaporation of the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nJ1550\u2013564 9\nFigure 7.

In quies-\ncence this can power the observed low level X\u2013ray emission\nwithout triggering the instability as long as these are dis-\ntributed over the whole disk (powered by the local m\u02d9 at\na given radius which is not constant) rather than requir-\ning that the X\u2013rays are produced solely by the central m\u02d9\n(Nayakshin & Svensson 2001). However, numerical simula-\ntions imply that the Balbus\u2013Hawley dynamo mechanism for\nthe magnetic field shuts off when the disk material becomes\nmainly neutral (so has large resistivity: Gammie & Menou\n1998; Fleming, Stone & Hawley 2000). The quiescent disk\nis then unlikely to be able to power any magnetic reconnec-\ntion, so the continuity of spectral properties from the LS\nto quiescence is hard to explain. Also, the inner quiescent\ndisk is predicted to be optically thin to both absorption and\nscattering, so the caveats listed in the previous section still\napply as to whether it can exist as a geometrically thin, cool\ndisk.\nIrrespective of whether this can produce the hard X\u2013\nrays observed in quiescence, the X\u2013ray emission from mag-\nnetic reconnection above the outbursting disk is likely to be\ndominant once the the instability is triggered since its lo-\ncal m\u02d9 will be so much larger. The heating wave starts in\nthe outer disk and moves inwards, carrying with it an ever\nincreasing amount of matter. While the disk would remain\nquiescent in front of the wave, it would switch into a hotter\nSS state behind it (e.g. Cannizzo 1998). The X\u2013rays dur-\ning the rise are then associated with magnetic reconnection\ngenerated by the Balbus\u2013Hawley mechanism above the out-\nbursting disk. In this case we would expect to see a steadily\ndecreasing radius (i.e. an increasing amount of relativistic\nsmearing) and \u2126\/2pi remaining constant at a value of unity.\nLS spectra in general (both in Cyg X\u20131 and during the\ndecline phase of the transient systems) show \u2126\/2pi < 1\n(irrespective of the continuum model used), which is in-\ncompatible with the magnetic flares model described above\n(Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1997; Z\u02d9ycki, Done & Smith 1997; 1998;\nDone & Z\u02d9ycki 1999; Gilfanov et al. 1999; Zdziarski, Lubin\u00b4ski\n& Smith 1999). However, if the reconnection regions are\nout-flowing rather than static then the reflection signature\ncan be suppressed by the resulting anisotropic emission (Be-\nloborodov 1999). For a constant outflow velocity then this\npredicts that \u2126\/2pi remains constant at some value < 1,\nwhile the amount of relativistic smearing increases. Alterna-\ntively, the generally observed LS correlation between spec-\ntral index and \u2126\/2pi can be explained by a variable outflow\nvelocity. Faster outflow velocities mean that more of the X\u2013\nray radiation is beamed away from the disk so there is a\nsmaller reflected fraction. This also means fewer soft pho-\ntons from the disk are intercepted by the active region, so\nthe spectra are harder (Beloborodov 1999). The observed\nsoftening as the outburst progresses then requires that the\noutflow speed decreases systematically through the rise (as\nshown in figure 8). Interestingly, this gives the observed cor-\nrelation between jet strength and spectral state if the outflow\nis treated as the base of a radio jet (Fender 2000).\n6 MODELS OF THE VERY HIGH STATE\nDURING THE OUTBURST\nThe (admittedly few) broad band HS\/VHS spectra show\na rather complex spectrum. There is plainly a strong disk\ncomponent at \u223c 1 keV, and a high energy tail. The VHS\nspectrum shown in Figure 4 shows the tail extending out\nbeyond 200 keV, while OSSE data from other objects show\nit out to even higher energies (Grove et al. 1998; Gierlin\u00b4ski\net al. 1999). The lack of distinct scattering orders strongly\nargues against thermal Comptonization models in the HS\nof Cyg X\u20131 (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999), and the two proposed\nmechanisms in the literature involve a non\u2013thermal elec-\ntron distribution either from magnetic flares (Poutanen &\nCoppi 1998) or from bulk motion of the infalling material as\nit approaches the black hole event horizon (Chakrabarti &\nTitarchuk 1995). The major problem with the bulk motion\nmodel is that the free\u2013fall electron velocities are not high\nenough (typical velocities of \u223c 0.7c imply Lorentz factors of\nonly \u03b3 \u223c 1.4) to extend the power law past \u223c 100\u2212300 keV\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n10 Colin D. Wilson and C. Done\n(Laurent & Titarchuk 1999, Zdziarski 2000) yet the highest\nsignal\u2013to\u2013noise HS\/VHS spectra extend unbroken beyond\nthis (GRO J1655-40: Grove et al. 1998; Cyg X-1: Gierlin\u00b4ski\net al., 1999). Thus it seems that the power law must arise\nfrom highly relativistic non\u2013thermal electron distribution.\nAs well as the non\u2013thermal power law, there is an ad-\nditional continuum component which is clearly seen in the\nfew broad band VHS\/HS spectra (Figure 4, Figure 5 and\nCyg X\u20131: Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999; Frontera et al. 2000). This\ncan be described as a thermal Comptonized continuum,\nbut at lower temperature than the standard LS emission.\nIt seems entirely possible that the difference between the\nVHS and HS spectra is merely in the strength of this ad-\nditional thermal component. This thermal\/non\u2013thermal (or\nhybrid) plasma most likely represents incomplete thermal-\nization of the magnetic reconnection energy, so that the ther-\nmal and non\u2013thermal electron distributions are co\u2013spatial\nrather than there being two separate electron populations\n(Poutanen & Coppi 1998; Coppi 1999).\nSince there is very little radio emission in the HS\n(Fender 2000) then the emission regions are probably not\nlinked to a relativistic outflow. Thus the HS (and by exten-\nsion the VHS) are most likely to be linked with rather low\nvelocity outflows, or static regions above the disk, as shown\nschematically in Figure 8, so should give rise to \u2126\/2pi \u223c 1 in\nthe reflector, and to an inner radius equal to the last stable\norbit.\n7 DISCUSSION\nThe parameters which we actually derive are shown in figure\n7. The reflected fraction, \u2126\/2pi, either remains essentially\nconstant around a value of \u223c 0.1, or drops from \u223c 0.25 to\n0.1 at the onset of the LS\u2013VHS transition (depending on\nthe continuum model used). The inner radius remains fairly\nconstant: the errors on the data are large enough to cover\nmost trends although we note that the results are never\nconsistent with a disk extending down to the last stable\norbit, nor with a disk truncated at 1000 Schwarzchild radii.\nThe LS spectrum is roughly consistent with the pres-\nence of either an ADAF or of out-flowing magnetic flares\nabove the (outbursting) disk. The data can even be com-\npatible with static magnetic flares, as there is an ioniza-\ntion instability which is present in X\u2013ray illuminated mate-\nrial in hydrostatic balance. Intense X\u2013ray irradiation of the\ndisk can produce a sharp transition in the vertical structure\nof the disk, with a highly ionized skin forming on top of\nmainly neutral material. In the LS, the hard spectrum has a\nCompton temperature which is high enough to completely\nstrip iron. The skin is then almost completely reflective, and\nforms no spectral features. The observed reflected signature\nis then dominated by photons reflected from deeper in the\ndisk, where the material is much less ionised (Nayakshin,\nKazanas & Kallman 2000). If the skin has an optical depth\nof around unity then this appreciably reduces the reflection\nsignature to \u2126\/2pi < 0.3 (Nayakshin 2000, Done & Nayak-\nshin 2001).\nFor the ADAF, the presence of a skin on the top of\nthe disk could give rise to an overestimation of the amount\nof relativistic smearing. The observed, mainly neutral, re-\nflected spectrum is subject to Compton scattering in the\nskin before it escapes. This can lead to some broadening of\nthe spectral features (line and edge) in addition to the rela-\ntivistic broadening of the features (see also Ross, Fabian &\nYoung 1999). Thus the theoretical difficulties in maintaining\nan ADAF with a small transition radius could be removed\nif the transition radius is overestimated because of Comp-\nton smearing. With magnetic flares, the ionized skin gives\nthe observed \u2126\/2pi < 1 and correlation with spectral index,\nwithout requiring a moderately relativistic outflow from the\ndisk (although such outflow may be additionally present!).\nThe detailed properties of the VHS reflected spectra\nare not at all consistent with the magnetic flares model de-\nveloped earlier. The amount of reflection is very much less\nthan \u223c unity predicted by such flares at low outflow veloc-\nity. However, the ionization is also high, indicating that we\nare not dealing with a mainly neutral disk. Unlike the LS\nspectrum, photo\u2013ionization of the disk surface cannot easily\nsuppress the amount of observed reflection. The Compton\ntemperature is low, so the ionization state of the X\u2013ray il-\nluminated skin is not high enough to completely strip iron,\nand the derived solid angle is generally not strongly under-\nestimated (Nayakshin, Kazanas & Kallman 2000; Done &\nNayakshin 2001). However, there can also be substantial col-\nlisional ionization as the observed disk temperature is \u223c 0.7\nkeV, provided that the disk is in local thermal equilibrium (a\nlikely assumption). We used reflection models which assume\nthat the whole disk can be described by a single photo\u2013\nionization parameter, but plainly the hotter the disk, the\nmore highly ionized it will be simply due to collisional pro-\ncesses. From the Saha equation the mean ionization state\nof iron will be one in which the ionization energy is roughly\nequivalent to the temperature i.e. we expect that iron should\nbe dominated by He\u2013 and H\u2013like ions in the central regions\nwhere the X\u2013rays are predominantly produced. However, the\nelectrons are very nondegenerate, and a better estimate of\nthe ionization state is one with ionization energy \u223c 20kT i.e.\nthe inner regions of the disk will contain iron that has been\ncompletely stripped through collisional ionization processes\n(Rybicki & Lightman 1979). Thus reflection from the inner\ndisk is completely ionized, and has no spectral features. It is,\ntherefore, counted as continuum rather than reflected flux in\nspectral fitting. Observable reflection is only detected from\nfurther out in the disk, where relativistic smearing effects\nare smaller, although Compton up-scattering can again be\nan important broadening mechanism (Ross, Fabian & Young\n1999) which is not accounted for in our reflection code.\nThe importance of Compton up-scattering on our spec-\ntra can be demonstrated by the residuals to the VHS spec-\ntra. The co\u2013added residuals to all the spectra after the sud-\nden parameter transition are shown in figure 9. There is\nclearly a systematic problem with the modelling of the re-\nflected features at a level of \u223c 1%. A similar pattern of\nresiduals is seen when models of ionized disks which include\nCompton up-scattering of the reflected spectrum are fit with\nthe simpler reflection models used here (S. Nayakshin, pri-\nvate communication).\nComplete collisional ionization of the inner disk in the\nVHS can then lead to an underestimate of the solid angle\nsubtended by the reflector, and to an overestimate of the\ninner disk radius, although this latter effect can be partially\ncompensated for by the Compton up-scattering associated\nwith the ionized disk reflection. Thus our derived \u2126 \u223c 0.1\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nJ1550\u2013564 11\nFigure 8. A representation of the quiescent disk and ADAF models. The left hand side shows a quiescent disk being gradually replaced\nby a hot\/thin disk as the outburst progresses. A slowing relativistic wind is theorized as a mechanism for reducing the reflected fraction\nas the outburst progresses. The Balbus-Hawley reconnection regions are only present in the hot disk. The right hand side shows an\nADAF being penetrated and eventually destroyed by an encroaching hot disk. In the final state, magnetic reconnection acts as the hard\nX\u2013ray source.\nand inner radius \u2265 10 Schwarzchild radii may be consistent\nwith a disk which subtends a solid angle of \u223c 1 and extends\ndown to the last stable orbit when collisional ionization ef-\nfects are properly included.\nThis leaves us in the unfortunate situation of knowing\neven less than we did before. Ionization removes the last\nof our ability to test models for the origin of the X\u2013ray\nspectra using currently available spectral models for fitting\nthe X\u2013ray reflected spectrum. However, we note one incon-\nsistency which we suspect will remain even within properly\ncalculated ionization models. The continuing increase in fre-\nquency of the QPO indicates that the switch to the VHS\noccurs before the heating wave has propagated all the way\ndown to the last stable orbit. If so then we expect that the\nmagnetic corona will continue to increase in luminosity as\nthe disk radius decreases, but without a corresponding re-\nflected signature. This would imply that the hard X\u2013ray\nflux should increase, without a corresponding increase in re-\nflection, so the measured reflected fraction should decrease\n(while the ionization state and relativistic smearing remain\nconstant). However, we see the solid angle remain constant\nfrom the onset of the VHS transition. Plainly there is much\nthat is still not understood about the nature of the VHS\nemission.\n8 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have intensively studied the spectra of the rise phase of\nthe outburst of RXTE J1550\u2013564. At the onset of the XTE\ncoverage, the source is in a classic LS, and can be fit with\na spectrum consisting of seed photons from an accretion\ndisk (not detected in the RXTE bandpass) being thermally\nComptonized into a hard X\u2013ray spectrum which is then re-\nflected from the disk. There is subtle curvature in the spec-\ntrum, perhaps indicating that a single temperature Comp-\ntonization model is inadequate, although it may also be an\nartifact of remaining residuals in the PCA\/HEXTE cross\u2013\ncalibration. The source then makes a very smooth transi-\ntion to the VHS (without going through the classic HS),\nwhere the spectrum is dominated by disk emission which is\nstrongly Comptonized. The high energy spectral curvature\nduring the transition is inconsistent with a single temper-\nature Comptonization model. This effect is much larger in\nthe later spectra and so is unlikely to be due to calibra-\ntion issues. The transition and VHS spectra can be modeled\nby two thermal Compton components (one at low electron\ntemperature, the other considerably higher). This could be\nindicative of a hybrid thermal\u2013nonthermal plasma such as\nhas been fit to Cyg X\u20131 HS spectra (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1999).\nWe are most interested in the reflected spectrum rather\nthan the continuum, as this can be used to give an indica-\ntion of the source geometry and whether this changes dra-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n12 Colin D. Wilson and C. Done\nFigure 9. Co-added residuals of the later rise of J1550\u2013564.\nmatically at the LS\/VHS transition as required by ADAF\nmodels. We have derived values for the reflected fraction,\nthe ionization parameter and the inner disk radius for each\nspectrum.\nA sharp transition is seen in the ionization at the on-\nset of the LS\u2013VHS transition. The reflected fraction remains\nessentially constant at a value of \u2126\/2pi = 0.1 while the ion-\nization increases from mainly neutral to highly ionized (iron\nin He and H\u2013like ionization states). The inner radius inferred\nfrom relativistic smearing of the reflected spectral features\ncould not be well constrained, but is never as small as the\nlast stable orbit around a black hole.\nGiven theoretical uncertainties in the transition radius\nand extent of overlap between the ADAF and disk, then\nthe LS reflected spectrum is consistent with an ADAF in-\nterpretation, especially if photo\u2013ionization of the disk gives\nrise to an ionized skin which introduces significant Comp-\nton broadening as well as relativistic smearing. Similarly, a\nphoto\u2013ionized skin can make magnetic reconnection mod-\nels of the X\u2013ray flux fit the data, even without significant\noutflow velocities of the hard X\u2013ray region, although these\ncan be additionally present. However, the fact that the LS\nis seen when the increasing QPO frequency and disk insta-\nbility models clearly indicate that the outbursting disk has\nnot yet reached the last stable orbit shows that an inner SS\ndisk is not a necessary condition on the LS X\u2013ray emission.\nIonization can again distort the reflected spectrum de-\nrived in the VHS, only this time it is collisional rather than\nphoto ionization which is likely to be important (Given a\ndisk which is in LTE). Again this can suppress the observed\namount of reflection, and distort (generally suppress) the\nmost highly relativistically broadened features from the in-\nner disk.\n9 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Piotr Z\u02d9ycki for the use of his Comptonization and\nreflection codes and Sergei Nayakshin for illuminating dis-\ncussions.
