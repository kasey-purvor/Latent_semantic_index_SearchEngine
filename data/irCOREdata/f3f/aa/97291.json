INTRODUCTION\nThe gut is anatomically divided into two compartments:\nthe small intestine and the colon, both of which are lined\nwith a single layer of epithelial cells. This epithelium is the\nfastest self-renewing tissue of adult mammals: on average it\nis replaced every 5\u20136 days. The epithelium of both compart-\nments is organized into invaginations called crypts. In addi-\ntion the small intestine contains fingerlike protrusions called\nvilli that are absent in the colon. The fast renewal rate of gut\nepithelium is sustained by stem cells residing in the bottom\nof the crypts. Stem cells at the base of the crypt generate the\nsemidifferentiated \u0001or transit amplifying\u0002 cells that fill the\nlower part of the crypt and divide several times before giving\nrise to the fully differentiated cells. The fully differentiated\ncells migrate upwards and fill the upper part of the crypt\nbefore being shed into the gut lumen \u00031,2\u0004. There is experi-\nmental evidence suggesting that this process is a combina-\ntion of population pressure \u0001due to proliferation\u0002 and active\ncell migration \u00033,4\u0004. A schematic representation of the cell\ncompartments of the colonic crypt is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe primary driving force underlying the proliferation of\nepithelial cells is the Wnt signaling pathway, which is highly\nconserved in the animal kingdom \u00031,2,5\u0004. In the absence of\nthe Wnt ligand the concentration of the \u0002-catenin protein is\nmaintained at physiological levels due to the activity of a\ndegradation complex. This complex consists of adenomatous\npolyposis coli \u0001APC\u0002, the glycogen synthase kinase 3\u0002, the\ncasein kinase I and regulates the \u0002-catenin phosphorylation\nstatus \u00031,2,5\u0004. When the Wnt ligand is present the destruction\ncomplex is inactivated and \u0002-catenin is not phosphorylated\nand accumulates in the cell \u00031,2,5\u0004. In such conditions\n\u0002-catenin is able to reach the cell nucleus and interact with\nthe T-cell factor\/lymphoid enhancer factor \u0001TCF\/LEF\u0002 family\nof transcription factors to promote gene expression. The ac-\ntivation of TCF\/LEF is an important factor underlying the\nproliferative activity of healthy gut epithelium as well as the\npathological tissue activity occurring in colorectal cancer\n\u00031,2,5\u0004.\nTo investigate stem cell dynamics and cancer several\nmodels have been introduced \u00036\u201319\u0004 and an overview and\nclassification of them was presented in \u000313\u0004. One of the ear-\nliest and most influential models of colorectal cancer is that\nof Tomlinson and Bodmer \u00036\u0004 consisting of three compart-\nments: stem cells, semidifferentiated cells, and fully differ-\nentiated cells. This model is discrete and stem and differen-\ntiated cells are assumed either to die or to differentiate or\nself-renew at the end of their cell cycle. It was shown that the\nalteration of the rates of programmed cell death or cell dif-\nferentiation can explain several aspects of tumor behavior\n\u00036\u0004; this study was extended and generalized in \u000317,18\u0004 to\naccount for feedback and to remove the restrictions of syn-\nchrony and common cell cycle time in all compartments im-\nplicitly assumed in the original model. In Boman et al. \u00037\u0004 a\ncompartmental model was used to understand the experimen-\ntal data on patients with familial adenomatous polyposis\n\u0001FAP\u0002. In \u000311\u0004 a three compartment model of colorectal can-\ncer was investigated: the first compartment describes stem\ncells, the second contains the semidifferentiated cells and the\nlast one the fully differentiated cells. It was found that mu-\ntations in the compartment of semidifferentiating cells are\ncrucial for colon cancer initiation. Similarly, by using a lin-\near model of colon cancer, it was shown that chromosomal\ninstabilities are a key factor for tumorigenesis \u000310\u0004. By using\na similar approach these results were extended to leukemia\nstem cells \u000316\u0004. With the aid of a continuous mathematical\nmodel describing stem, early and late progenitor cells in neu-\nral cancer it was found that oncogenic events and sudden cell\npopulation depletion strongly impact the proliferative activ-\nity of the cells \u000312\u0004. The effects of genetic mutation on a\npopulation of stem cells were also studied in \u000314\u0004. As dis-\ncussed the Wnt signaling pathway is an important factor in\nthe development of a cancerous tissue and the biochemical\nprocesses driving this signaling cascade were studied theo-\nretically in \u000315\u0004. By using a mathematical model describing\nthe stem, transit amplifying and fully differentiated cells of\nthe olfactory epithelium it was found that the self-regulation\nof the proliferative rates of these cells can enhance local\nstability \u000319\u0004. The understanding of the basic cellular mecha-\nnisms underlying cancer generation is a very important sci-\nentific challenge and, at present, is still an open problem for\nmost cancers \u000320\u0004. Complexity in carcinogenesis occurs at\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 81, 061909 \u00012010\u0002\n1539-3755\/2010\/81\u00016\u0002\/061909\u000112\u0002 \u00a92010 The American Physical Society061909-1\nmany hierarchical levels involving DNA, RNA, proteins, in-\ntracellular and extracellular biochemical pathways, tissues,\nand organs. Therefore it is important to stress that the model\nthat will be studied in the present paper neglects the internal\nstructure of the cells but aims to understand how properties\nat the cell level affect tissue level behavior.\nIn our paper a mathematical model describing the cell\npopulations in colorectal crypts is introduced and studied. In\nparticular the conditions leading to unlimited growth of the\ncell populations are investigated. The aim is to understand\nhow self-renewal, differentiation, and apoptosis affect the\nsize of the involved cellular species. For simplicity, the\nmodel consists of three compartments in which the spatial\nlocation of the cells is not considered so the model is not\nsuited to investigate the mechanisms controlling cell migra-\ntion or other connected phenomena. The study of the more\ncomplex cell population dynamics, arising from the inclusion\nof spatial cell location and migration phenomena, will be\npursued in future work. However, as pointed out in \u000313\u0004,\ncompartmental models are very useful for obtaining insight\non the processes driving the population dynamics of the\ncrypt, in spite of the above approximation. An additional\ncomment on our model is that it neglects the heterogeneous\nexpression of cells during tumor progression: i.e., the non-\nuniform distribution of the microscopic state of the cells\n\u000321,22\u0004. Most tumors become more aggressive and malignant\nin their characteristics over time although this time course\nmay be quite variable; this phenomenon is termed tumor\nprogression \u000321\u0004. As pointed out by Nowell \u000321\u0004 it is com-\nmon, particularly with rapidly growing tumors, to find het-\nerogeneity so that some subpopulations of the neoplastic\ncells may appear much further advanced than others in the\ndegree of tumor progression. As predicted by Nowell \u000323\u0004\nthis phenomenon is a consequence of the clonal evolution\nprocess. Here we use a macroscopic model, in terms of or-\ndinary differential equations, in which the above mechanisms\ndriving tumor evolution are not described. However it is pos-\nsible to introduce models at a lower scale in which cellular\nheterogeneity, arising from tumor progression, can be taken\ninto account \u000322\u0004. Such approaches are described in a general\nsetting in \u000322\u0004.\nThe starting point of the present work is the model of the\ncolorectal crypt recently proposed by some of us \u000317\u0004, de-\nscribing three cellular species: the stem cells, the semidiffer-\nentiated cells and the fully differentiated cells. The goal of\nthe present paper is to generalize that work, and to this aim\nwe will consider a model in which the self-renewal rate of\nsemidifferentiated cells is an increasing function of the popu-\nlation size. The stability properties of the corresponding sta-\ntionary states will be studied to identify those dynamical\nregimes which can lead to unlimited growth. In the first part\nof the paper the study will be carried out theoretically, while\nin the final part the results of model simulations will be\ndiscussed. Moreover, the effect of noise on the dynamical\nbehavior of the cell populations will be investigated.\nII. MODEL DESCRIPTION\nLet x denote the population of stem cells, y denote that of\nthe semidifferentiated \u0001or transit-amplifying\u0002 cells, and z de-\nnote that of the fully differentiated cells in the colonic crypt.\nLet us consider the continuum model describing these popu-\nlations adopted in Johnston et al. \u000317\u0004. In this model the\npopulation of stem cells is described by the equation x\u02d9\n=\u00033x\u2212\u00032x\u2212\u00031x, where the parameter \u00033 is the renewal rate\nof these cells, \u00032 is the transition rate from the stem cell\ncompartment to the semidifferentiated cell compartment, and\n\u00031 represents the rate of stem cell apoptosis \u0001see Fig. 1\u0002.\nSimilarly, the population of semidifferentiated cells is de-\nscribed by the equation y\u02d9=\u00023y\u2212\u00022y\u2212\u00021y+\u00032x, where \u00023 is\nthe renewal rate of these cells and \u00021 the corresponding apo-\nptotic rate, while \u00022 is the transition rate from the semidif-\nferentiated cell compartment to that of the fully differentiated\ncells \u0001see Fig. 1\u0002. The time evolution of the population of the\nfully differentiated cells is described by the equation\nz\u02d9=\u2212\u0004z+\u00022y, where \u0004 is the removal rate of these cells \u0001see\nFig. 1\u0002. To summarize, the full model is\ndx\ndt\n= \u0001\u0003\u00af \u2212 \u00032\u0002x , \u00011a\u0002\ndy\ndt\n= \u0001\u0002\u00af \u2212 \u00022\u0002y + \u00032x , \u00011b\u0002\ndz\ndt\n= \u2212 \u0004z + \u00022y . \u00011c\u0002\nwhere \u0003\u00af=\u00033\u2212\u00031 and \u0002\u00af =\u00023\u2212\u00021. It was shown that nontrivial\npositive steady state solutions of Eqs. \u00011a\u0002\u2013\u00011c\u0002 can exist\nonly in the cases \u0003\u00af\u2212\u00032\u00050, \u0002\u00af \u2212\u00022=0 and \u0003\u00af\u2212\u00032=0, \u0002\u00af \u2212\u00022\n\u00050 \u000317\u0004. This system is, of course, structurally unstable. To\nobtain a more realistic description of the dynamics of the\nstem cells the previous model is modified by introducing the\nterm \u2212kx2\u0001k\u00060\u0002 on the right-hand side of Eq. \u00011a\u0002. Thus, the\ntime evolution of the stem cell population is described by\nlogistic dynamics \u000324\u0004. To justify this modification some\ngeneral considerations are necessary. Both the normal and\ncancer tissue contain the same population of cells: the stem\ncells, the semidifferentiated cells, and the fully differentiated\ncells \u00032\u0004. Normal tissue renewal and growth of cancer are\nboth due to semidifferentiated cells. Usually, the stem cells\nFIG. 1. Schematic representation of the colonic crypt structure\nadopted in the model. There are three compartments and the arrows\nindicate the processes driving the cell behavior. See text for further\ndetails.\nDI GARBO et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 81, 061909 \u00012010\u0002\n061909-2\nof both normal and cancer tissues are relatively few in num-\nber \u0001compared to the semidifferentiated cells and fully dif-\nferentiated cells\u0002 and are proliferating \u00032\u0004. Experimental re-\nsults obtained in Hydra stem cells clearly show that the\npopulation size is controlled by negative feedbacks from the\nneighboring cells: i.e., the increase in the population size\ndetermines a decrease in the self-renewal rate of the stem\ncells \u000325\u0004. The dependence of the renewal rate on the stem\ncell density was modeled by a logistic dynamics by Hardy\nand Stark \u00038\u0004 and by a sigmoid profile by Zhdanov \u000326\u0004.\nMore recently the problem of cell population growth was\naddressed in a general framework by Kilian et al. \u000327\u0004. Based\non general biological principles these authors formulated\ngeneral equations describing the growth curves of all cell\ntypes by showing that these processes are driven by logistic\ndynamics \u000327\u0004. Moreover, by using experimental data on the\nin vitro proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells, it was\nfound that the time evolution of the population size is de-\nscribed by a logistic equation \u000328\u0004. Moreover, a logistic ki-\nnetics to describe the growth of a population of stem cells\nwas also adopted by other authors \u000314,29,30\u0004.\nNormal tissue renewal and growth of cancer both occur\nby division of the transit amplifying \u0001or semidifferentiated\u0002\ncells \u00032\u0004. Moreover, experimental data from a variety of ani-\nmal and tissue culture studies suggest that tumor growth de-\ncelerates with increasing cell population size and sigmoidal\n\u0001or S-shaped\u0002 curves are used to fit the data \u000331\u201334\u0004. Thus,\nthe second modification takes into account that the rate of\nrenewal of the population of the semidifferentiated cells de-\npends on the population size. Such an assumption is also in\nkeeping with the recent work of d\u2019Onofrio and Tomlinson\n\u000318\u0004 and can be ascribed, for example, to the alteration of the\nmechanisms regulating \u0002-catenin concentration \u00032\u0004. The lat-\nter can arise from transcription errors or through a loss of the\nfunction of the APC degradation factor \u0001see Sec. I\u0002 \u000335,36\u0004.\nThus, on the basis of the above discussion, it is assumed that\nthe rate of self-renewal of the semidifferentiated cells is a\nsigmoidal function of the population size, in particular a\nHill-like growth rate is adopted:\n\u00023\u0001y\u0002 = \u00023 +\npyn\nq + yn\n, p\u0006 0, q\u0006 0, n\u0001 \u0007 . \u00012\u0002\nInserting the above change into Eq. \u00011b\u0002 leads to the follow-\ning system of equations to describe the time evolution of the\ncell populations in the colon crypts:\ndx\ndt\n= \u0001\u0003\u00af \u2212 \u00032\u0002x \u2212 kx2, \u00013a\u0002\ndy\ndt\n= \u0001\u0002\u00af \u2212 \u00022\u0002y +\npyn+1\n\u0001q + yn\u0002\n+ \u00032x , \u00013b\u0002\ndz\ndt\n= \u2212 \u0004z + \u00022y . \u00013c\u0002\nBecause the population size of the stem cells follows a lo-\ngistic growth toward a stationary value \u00032,27,28,31\u201334\u0004, a\npositive value of the parameter \u0003\u00af\u2212\u00032 is adopted in this pa-\nper. From Eq. \u00013b\u0002 it follows that unlimited growth occurs if\n\u0002\u00af \u2212\u00022=\u00023\u2212\u00022\u2212\u00021\u00060. On the other hand the experimental\ndata on hematopoietic cells of cat and mouse discussed in\n\u000337\u0004 indicate that the value of \u0002\u00af \u2212\u00022 can be positive or nega-\ntive and we allow for this in the model. A similar assumption\nwas also adopted in other studies of cell population dynamics\nin the colon crypt \u000317,38\u0004. For instance, changes in \u0002 could\narise because of cellular damage, the mutation of genes con-\ntrolling the differentiation process, alteration of the Wnt sig-\nnaling pathways, a change in the apoptosis rate, etc. \u00032\u0004.\nIII. STATIONARY STATES\nTo simplify the notation let us define \u0003= \u0003\u00af\u2212\u00032 and \u0002\n=\u0002\u00af \u2212\u00022 in Eqs. \u00013a\u0002 and \u00013b\u0002. Let us remark that Eq. \u00013a\u0002,\ndescribing the stem cell population, is not coupled to the\nremaining two and is completely solvable. If at time t=0 the\nsize of the population of stem cells is x0\u00060, then its solution\nis given by x\u0001t\u0002= \u0001\u0003x0k\u22121\u0002 \/ \u0003x0+ \u0001\u0003 \/k\u2212x0\u0002e\u2212\u0003t\u0004. Because \u0003\n\u00060 it follows that the nontrivial stationary state \u0001xeq=\u0003 \/k\u0002\nof Eq. \u00013a\u0002 is stable. Before proceeding to analyze the full\nsystem \u0003Eqs. \u00013a\u0002\u2013\u00013c\u0002\u0004 let us show that solutions exist and\nare positive. The right-hand sides of Eqs. \u00013a\u0002\u2013\u00013c\u0002 are con-\ntinuous with continuous partial derivatives and this implies\nthe existence and uniqueness of the solution of the initial\nvalue problem. As shown before x\u0001t\u0002= \u0001\u0003x0k\u22121\u0002 \/ \u0003x0+ \u0001\u0003 \/k\n\u2212x0\u0002e\u2212\u0003t\u0004\u00060, thus it is sufficient to show that y\u0001t\u0002\u00060 and\nz\u0001t\u0002\u00060. To this aim it is sufficient to show that by choosing\narbitrary initial conditions x\u00010\u0002=x0\u00060, y\u00010\u0002=y0\u00060, and\nz\u00010\u0002=z0\u00060, the solutions to Eqs. \u00013b\u0002 and \u00013c\u0002 are such that\ny\u0001t\u0002\u00060 and z\u0001t\u0002\u00060. Consider first the equations y\u00af\u02d9 =\u0002y\u00af and\nz\u00af\u02d9 =\u2212\u0004z\u00af satisfying the initial conditions y\u00af\u00010\u0002=y0\u00060 and\nz\u00af\u00010\u0002=z0\u00060.

To investigate\nthe local stability properties of the corresponding stationary\nstates the sign of the time derivative of the population of\nsemidifferentiated cells will be studied in a neighborhood of\nthe equilibrium value \u0001y\u0001\u0002. Obviously, if y\u0001 is an unstable\nfixed point then the corresponding stationary state of Eqs.\n\u00013a\u0002\u2013\u00013c\u0002 will also be unstable. Moreover it can be proved\nthat all stationary states for which \u0007 dP\u0001y\u0002dy \u0007y=y\u0001\u00010 are hyper-\nbolic. Then the Hartman-Grobman theorem \u000339\u0004 implies that\nthe linearly stable \u0001or unstable\u0002 states are also locally nonlin-\nearly stable \u0001or unstable\u0002.\nLet us list the properties of the polynomial P\u0001y\u0002 defined in\nEq. \u00015\u0002: P\u00010\u0002=Rq\u00060 and limy\u2192\u2212\tP\u0001y\u0002=+\t for odd n val-\nues, while limy\u2192\u2212\tP\u0001y\u0002=\u2212\t for even n values. Moreover\nlimy\u2192+\tP\u0001y\u0002=+\t for any n. From the above properties it\nfollows that for odd n values and when two positive roots\nexist, the corresponding graph of P\u0001y\u0002 is like that depicted in\npanel a of Fig. 2. Then, from the plot of Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, it follows\nthat the stationary state corresponding to S1 is stable while\nthat corresponding to S2 is unstable \u0001see the arrows\u0002. This\ncase is interesting because an unlimited growth of the popu-\nlation of semidifferentiated cells can occur. This can happen\nby choosing initial conditions within the basin of attraction\nof S2 or in the presence of a suitable perturbation. For in-\nstance, let us assume that the populations are in a dynamical\nregime close to the stationary state S1. Then, the presence of\na suitable perturbation can bring the system into the basin of\nattraction of the unstable state S2 and unlimited growth can\noccur. Such behavior will be illustrated in more detail later\nby using specific numerical simulations. Similarly, for even n\nvalues the generic graph of P\u0001y\u0002, when two positive roots\nexist, is like that shown in panel b of Fig. 2. The root S1\ncorresponds to a stable stationary state and S2 to an unstable\none. Also in this case we can have unlimited growth. The\ncase \u0002+ p=0 is equivalent to the previous one: only 2 or 0\nroots can exist and the stability properties of the correspond-\ning stationary states are the same as above.\nBefore continuing the study of the stationary states, it is\nnecessary to make some remarks concerning the role of mul-\ntistability in a biological context. There is experimental evi-\ndence that bistability plays an important role in the determi-\nnation of the cell fate options that include self-renewal,\ndifferentiation, apoptosis, and lineage specification. The ex-\nperimental data suggest that during development or differen-\ntiation cells make very precise transitions between stable net-\nwork states \u0001or gene expression patterns\u0002 \u000340\u0004. For instance,\nthese transitions can occur when the level of a single tran-\nscription factor within a genetic network is subject to fluc-\ntuations \u000340\u201346\u0004. Such changes can be driven by the internal\nnoise that is inherent to the biochemical reactions or to ex-\nternal noise originating from random variations of the exter-\nnal signaling conditions \u000340,41,45\u0004.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 81, 061909 \u00012010\u0002\n061909-4\nwent differentiation: it was found that this process exhibits\nnonlinear features similar to those characterizing the func-\ntioning of a bistable switch model \u000347\u0004. Thus the authors\nsuggest that the differentiation process is not a linear process\nand can be described by a nonlinear bistable switch. More-\nover to model the experimental data, a S-shaped function\nwas used to describe the nonlinear positive feedback loop\ncharacterizing the differentiation process. In another recent\npaper the contribution of gene expression noise to the phe-\nnotypic cell-to-cell variability within clonal populations was\nstudied experimentally \u000348\u0004, suggesting that, although the\nmechanisms underlying cell-to-cell variability are not well\nknown, this phenomenon exhibits multistability and noise-\ndriven transitions between stable states is one source of cell-\nto-cell clonal population heterogeneity \u000348\u0004. How the noise\nimpacts the behavior of our model will be investigated nu-\nmerically in the final section of this paper. Coming back to\nthe analysis of the stationary states of Eqs. \u00013a\u0002\u2013\u00013c\u0002 let us\nconsider now the case \u0002+ p\u00050. It will be shown, as the\nexperimental data suggest, that our model predicts the exis-\ntence of bistable regimes when such condition is fulfilled.\n\u0001B\u0002 Let \u0001\u0002 + p\u0002\u0005 0.\nIn this case the signs of the coefficients of the polynomial\nP\u0001y\u0002 are\nyn+1 yn y Rq \u0002 \u2212 values\n\u2212 + \u2212 + \u0002 \u0005 \u2212 p .\n\u00017\u0002\nThere are three variations and the number of positive roots of\nP\u0001y\u0002 can be 3, 1, or 0. Moreover, limy\u2192\u2212\tP\u0001y\u0002=\u2212\t for odd n\nvalues, while limy\u2192\u2212\tP\u0001y\u0002=+\t for even n values. Lastly,\nlimy\u2192+\tP\u0001y\u0002=\u2212\t for any n value. For odd n values the\ngraph of the polynomial P\u0001y\u0002, when a single positive root\nexists, is like that shown in Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002. In this case, from\ndy \/dt=\u0002y+ py\nn+1\nq+yn +R= P\u0001y\u0002 \/ \u0001q+y\nn\u0002, it follows that the sta-\ntionary state of Eqs. \u00013a\u0002\u2013\u00013c\u0002 corresponding to S1 is globally\nstable for biologically realistic initial conditions. When P\u0001y\u0002\npossesses three positive roots its graph looks like that shown\nin Fig. 2\u0001d\u0002 and the stationary states corresponding to S1 and\nS3 are stable, while that corresponding to S2 is unstable. Also\nin this case unlimited growth cannot occur. The same con-\nclusions also hold for even n values \u0001panels e and f of Fig.\n2\u0002.\nOverall, the above findings imply that unlimited growth\ncan occur when the parameter \u0002 satisfies the following in-\nequality: \u2212p\u0005\u0002\u00050. A biological interpretation of the previ-\nous condition is the following. As \u0002=\u00023\u2212\u00022\u2212\u00021 the condi-\ntion \u0002\u0006\u2212p is equivalent to \u00023+ p\u0006\u00022+\u00021, and the last\ninequality states that unlimited growth can occur because the\nmaximum value of the renewal rate of the population of\nsemidifferentiated cells is larger than the sum of the differ-\nentiation and apoptotic rates. The above condition implies\nthat there exists a threshold value yth separating two different\ndynamical regimes. For 0\u0005y\u0001t\u0002\u0005yth the population of se-\nmidifferentiated cells is bounded. When y\u0001t\u0002\u0006yth unlimited\ngrowth occurs. This conclusion can be proved as follows. As\n\u0002=\u00023\u2212\u00022\u2212\u00021\u00050, then from Eq. \u00012\u0002 it follows that the in-\nequality \u00023\u0001y\u0002\u0006\u00022+\u00021 will be satisfied if y\u0006yth= \u0003\n\u2212q\u0002\np+\u0002 \u0004\n1\/n\n.\nThus, if the size of the population of the semidifferentiated\ncells overcomes the threshold then unlimited growth occurs.\nAn important point that deserves a mention is the relevance\nof the condition p\u0006\u0002+ p\u00060 within the biological context.\nThere is clear experimental evidence that the self-renewal\nrate of stem cells and semidifferentiated cells is variable\n\u00031,5,49\u0004. The causes of this variation can be intrinsic \u0001levels\nof transcription factors, signaling pathways, etc.\u0002 or extrinsic\n\u0001host factors, microenvironment, immune response, etc.\u0002 \u00035\u0004.\nFor instance mutation of the p53 gene that is involved in\napoptosis may be an important factor in causing changes in\nthe net growth rate of cells \u00036,35\u0004. In our model the self-\nrenewal rate of the semidifferentiated cells is assumed to be\nvariable as the experimental data suggest. The condition p\n\u0006\u0002+ p\u00060 is biologically realistic and can be justified, for\ninstance, by alteration of the Wnt signaling pathways \u0001or the\np53 signaling pathways\u0002 both controlling the growth prop-\nerty of the intestinal epithelium \u00035\u0004. For instance a decrease\nin the apoptosis rate \u00021 \u0001or the differentiation rate \u00022\u0002 of the\nsemidifferentiated cells determines an increase in the value\nof \u0002+ p=\u00023\u2212\u00022\u2212\u00021+ p. On the other hand when \u0002+ p\u00050\nthe rate of apoptosis and differentiation overcomes the rate\nof the positive feedback driving self-renewal and abnormal\ntissue growth cannot occur.\nLet us investigate the boundedness properties of the solu-\ntions of Eqs. \u00013a\u0002\u2013\u00013c\u0002 when the stem cell population is as-\nsumed to be constant: x=xeq=\u0003 \/k. The following proposi-\ntion provides the conditions for bounded solutions.\nProposition I. Let x=xeq=\u0003 \/k then the solutions of Eqs.\n\u00013a\u0002\u2013\u00013c\u0002 are bounded if \u0001a\u0002 \u0002=\u2212p, n=1, R\u0005pq or \u0001b\u0002 \u0002\n+ p\u00050.\nProof. These results can be proved by studying the signs\nof dy \/dt and dz \/dt.\nThe biological meaning of the above proposition is as\nfollows: when \u0002+ p\u00050 the rate of apoptosis and differentia-\ntion overcomes the rate of the positive feedback driving self-\nrenewal and abnormal tissue growth cannot occur. When \u0002\n+ p=0 it follow that y\u02d9=\u2212pqy \/ \u0001q+yn\u0002+R. If n\u00061 then y\u02d9\n\u00060 for y\u0006 \u0003q \/ \u0001n\u22121\u0002\u00041\/n and the solution starting at y\u00010\u0002\n=y0\u0006 \u0003q \/ \u0001n\u22121\u0002\u00041\/n cannot be bounded. Instead, if n=1 and\nR\u0005pq then the solution of the above equation is bounded\nand an acceptable stationary value of the population of\nsemidifferentiated cells will exist \u0001yeq\u00060\u0002.\nIV. MODEL GENERALIZATION\nLet us now consider a more general form of the model\ndescribed by Eqs. \u00013a\u0002\u2013\u00013c\u0002 by adopting, for the rate of\nrenewal of semidifferentiated cells, the following form:\n\u00023\u0001y\u0002 = \u00023 + F\u0001y\u0002 . \u00018\u0002\nWe consider which properties the function F should have to\nbe biologically realistic. As discussed in the previous sec-\ntions the growth rate of solid tumors decelerates with in-\ncreasing tumor size \u000325,34\u0004. Therefore, the dependence of\nthe net growth rate of the cells on the population size can be\ndescribed by a sigmoidal function \u000334,49\u0004. Whence it is as-\nsumed that the function F\u0001y\u0002 possesses the following\nproperties:\nVARIABLE RENEWAL RATE AND GROWTH PROPERTIES\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 81, 061909 \u00012010\u0002\n061909-5\n\u0001i\u0002 Differentiable in \u00030,+\t\u0003.\n\u0001ii\u0002 F\u00010\u0002=0.\n\u0001iii\u0002 F\u0001\u0001y\u0002\u00060.\n\u0001iv\u0002 limy\u2192+\tF\u0001y\u0002=L\u0005+\t.\nThe model now reads as\ndx\ndt\n= \u0003x \u2212 kx2, \u00019a\u0002\ndy\ndt\n= \u0002y + F\u0001y\u0002y + \u00032x , \u00019b\u0002\ndz\ndt\n= \u2212 \u0004z + \u00022y . \u00019c\u0002\nAs in Sec.

Moreover, the\njustification for using logistic dynamics to describe the stem\ncell compartment is as that in Sec. II. Let us now search for\nthe stationary states of this dynamical system. From the first\nequation it follows that xeq=0 or xeq=\u0003 \/k;\n\u0001A\u0002 xeq = 0.\nIt can be proved that in this case biologically realistic stable\nstationary solutions of Eqs. \u00019a\u0002\u2013\u00019c\u0002 do not exist;\n\u0001B\u0002 xeq =\n\u0003\nk\n.\nBy substituting x=xeq=\n\u0003\nk we obtain the following equation:\n\u0002y + F\u0001y\u0002y + R = 0, \u000110\u0002\nwhere R= \u0001\u00032\u0003\u0002 \/k\u00060.

We\nremark that the requirement L\u0005\u2212\u0002 is a necessary condition\nfor the proof of the above proposition. In fact there are cases\n\u0001with L\u0006\u2212\u0002\u0002 where, although the function F\u0001y\u0002 satisfies all\nthe hypotheses of the proposition, a positive root can or can-\nnot exist. For instance let us consider the functions F\u0001y\u0002\n= \u00010.6y2\u0002 \/ \u0001y2+160\u0002 and \u2212\u0001\u0002+R \/y\u0002=\u2212\u00013 \/y\u22120.59\u0002, for which\nthe inequality L=0.6\u0006\u2212\u0002=0.59 holds. In this case the equa-\ntion F\u0001y\u0002=\u2212\u0001\u0002+R \/y\u0002 possesses two positive roots. However,\nif the choice F\u0001y\u0002= \u00010.6y2\u0002 \/ \u0001y2+20\u0002 is adopted, then the pre-\nvious equation does not possess any positive root.\nLet us now assume that the function F\u0001y\u0002+ \u0001Ry +\u0002\u0002 pos-\nsesses only a single root \u0001y\u0001\u0002. Then the following proposition\ncharacterizes the stability property of the stationary state of\nEqs. \u00019a\u0002\u2013\u00019c\u0002 corresponding to y\u0001.\nProposition III. Let y\u0001\u00060 be the only positive root of the\nfunction F\u0001y\u0002+ \u0001R \/y+\u0002\u0002, with F\u0001y\u0002 satisfying the properties\nof proposition II and R\u00060, \u0002\u00050, L\u0005\u2212\u0002. Then the station-\nary state S0= \u0001xeq ,yeq ,zeq\u0002= \u0001\n\u0003\nk ,y\n\u0001\n,\n\u00022y\u0001\n\u0004 \u0002 is stable.\nThe proof of this proposition is given in Appendix B.\nWe now investigate the stability properties of the corre-\nsponding stationary states when Eq. \u000112\u0002 possesses N\u00061 dis-\ntinct positive roots yj\n\u0001 \u0001j=1,2 , . . . ,N ,yj\u0001\u0005yj+1\u0001 \u0002. For N=2,\n\u0002\u00050, L+\u0002\u00050 the possible graphical configurations of the\nfunctions F\u0001y\u0002 and \u2212\u0001R \/y+\u0002\u0002 are those shown in Fig. 3.\nFor the case depicted in the left panel the stationary state\ncorresponding to S2 is stable. For the stationary state corre-\nsponding to S1 one of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix\nof Eqs. \u00019a\u0002\u2013\u00019c\u0002 is zero: \n2=\u0002+\nd\ndy \u0003yF\u0001y\u0002\u0004y=y\u0001=0. In this\ncase the stability of this stationary state can be investigated\nby using the local properties of the graphs of F\u0001y\u0002 and\n\u2212\u0001R \/y+\u0002\u0002. As the sign of y\u02d9 is positive both to the left and to\nthe right of S1 it follows that this stationary state is not\nstable. By using the same approach it can be shown that for\nthe configuration reported on the right panel of Fig. 3 unlim-\nited growth cannot occur. This happens because S1 is stable\nand y\u02d9\u00050 both to the left and right of S2.\nThe existence of more than two distinct zeros can\nalso occur, depending on the choice of F\u0001y\u0002. Let yj\n\u0001\n\u0001j=1,2 , . . . ,N ,yj\u0001\u0005yj+1\u0001 \u0002 be the N\u00062 distinct roots, then the\nfollowing proposition holds.\nProposition IV. If unlimited growth of the population of\nsemidifferentiated cells occurs then the stationary state cor-\nresponding to yN\n\u0001 is unstable.\nThe proof of this proposition is given in Appendix C. The\nboundedness properties of the solutions of these equations\nare characterized by the following proposition.\nProposition V. Let F\u0001y\u0002 satisfy all properties specified in\nproposition II and x=xeq=\u0003 \/k. If \u0002+L\u00050 then all solutions\nof Eqs. \u00019b\u0002 and \u00019c\u0002 are bounded.\nThe proof of this proposition is given in Appendix D. We\nremark that in the case \u0002+L=0 and x=xeq=\u0003 \/k the bound-\nedness properties of the solutions of Eqs. \u00019b\u0002 and \u00019c\u0002 are\ndependent on the choice of F\u0001y\u0002.\nFIG. 3.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 81, 061909 \u00012010\u0002\n061909-6\nTo take into account the possible biological implications\nof the above findings it is important to make some appropri-\nate comments. An important biological concept characteriz-\ning cell biology is that of cell fate options. It is thought that\ncells initiate differentiation, apoptosis, or self-renewal de-\npending on the level of activation of specific biochemical\nsignaling pathways. The molecular processes underlying the\nswitch from one state to another determines \u0001through the\nactivation of suitable genes\u0002 the cell fate decision \u000340\u0004. The\nrelevance of switchlike decisions in biological processes has\nbeen revealed in a wide range of systems \u000340,50\u0004. For in-\nstance in \u000351\u0004 it was shown that the activation of many mo-\nlecular processes can be described by sigmoidal functions\nwhich allow the biological system the possibility of adopting\nalternative stable steady states. Moreover, positive feedback\nloops\u2014such as the one used in our model \u0003\u0002y+F\u0001y\u0002y\u0004\u2014are\nat the basis of the complex biochemical pathways controlling\ncell fate decisions \u000351\u0004. The multistable nature of biological\nswitches is very important for the determination of cell fate\nin unicellular and multicellular organisms \u000352\u201355\u0004. Thus, the\nchange in the levels of gene expression can switch a cell\nfrom one stable state to another. Moreover there are clear\nexperimental and theoretical data indicating that multistabil-\nity arises in biological systems controlled by positive feed-\nback loops \u000340,44,56\u0004. In the case of colorectal tissue such\nstable stationary states could be associated with the presence\nof adenomas. Our model suggests the existence of multista-\nbility in the colorectal epithelium and these states can be\nassociated with the presence of different levels of adenoma-\ntous tissue in line with the above discussion.\nAnother question to be asked is the following: which bio-\nlogical conditions are required in order that Eqs. \u00019a\u0002\u2013\u00019c\u0002\npossess a single stable stationary state? It can be proven that\nif 0\u0005L\u0005\u2212\u0002 and dF \/dy\u0005R \/y2 then only one steady state\nexists. From a biological point of view this, together with\nproposition V, indicates that unlimited growth of the colorec-\ntal epithelium tissue cannot occur when 0\u0005L\u0005\u2212\u0002. The bio-\nlogical meaning of the above condition can be inferred from\nthe definition of \u0002=\u00023\u2212\u00022\u2212\u00021: in fact 0\u0005L\u0005\u2212\u0002 implies\nL+\u00023\u2212\u00022\u2212\u00021\u00050. The last condition has a very simple bio-\nlogical interpretation: when the maximum value of the rate\nof renewal \u0001L+\u00023\u0002 of the semidifferentiated cells is smaller\nthan the sum of the apoptosis and differentiation rate then\nunlimited growth cannot occur. Moreover, let us show that in\nthis case the model prediction can be interpreted as the ap-\npearance of a benign colon polyposis. In fact, when F\u0001y\u0002\n=0 and \u0002\u00050 the stable stationary state of Eqs. \u00019a\u0002\u2013\u00019c\u0002 is\nS= \u0001\u0003k ,\u2212\nR\n\u0002 ,\u2212\n\u00022R\n\u0004\u0002 \u0002. Instead, when F\u0001y\u0002\u00010 and 0\u0005L\u0005\u2212\u0002, the\nnew stable equilibrium solution of Eqs. \u00019a\u0002\u2013\u00019c\u0002 is S\n= \u0001\u0003k ,y\n\u0001\n,\u2212\n\u00022\n\u0004 y\n\u0001\u0002, with y\u0001\u0006\u2212\u0001R \/\u0002\u0002. This means that in the\nnew stable stationary state the population size of the semid-\nifferentiated and fully differentiated cells is bigger than\n\u0001\u2212 R\u0002 \u2212\n\u00022R\n\u0004\u0002 \u0002.\nWe now investigate the biological insights gained from\nthe above mathematical study. When considering the colonic\ncrypts we first must establish whether a stationary state \u0001i.e.,\nhomeostasis\u0002 can be achieved and if this state is stable. In the\nmodel, when F\u0001y\u0002=0, this condition is represented by the\nstable steady state S= \u0001\u0003k ,\u2212\nR\n\u0002 ,\u2212\n\u00022R\n\u0004\u0002 \u0002. The development of col-\norectal cancer is widely believed to occur through the ad-\nenoma to carcinoma transformation \u00035,36\u0004. The loss of Wnt\nsignaling is the early event in the formation of the adenoma.\nThe complete inactivation of the APC complex causes the\nformation of multiple bowel adenomas leading to a strong\nincrease in the probability of developing colorectal cancer\n\u00035,36\u0004. In our model the alteration of tissue growth arising\nfrom the above conditions can be achieved with the introduc-\ntion of an additional contribution to the renewal rate of the\nsemidifferentiated cells represented by F\u0001y\u0002\u00010. Whence, if\npropositions II and III hold simultaneously, a stable station-\nary state can exist only if the net proliferation rate \u0001L+\u0002\u0002 of\nsemidifferentiated cells satisfies \u0002+L\u00050. In this case the\ncorresponding biological interpretation of the theoretical re-\nsults is that there will be the formation of an adenoma with-\nout an aberrant and unlimited tissue growth. When there are\nmore stationary states \u0001that, from a biological point of view,\ncan be interpreted as the formation of multiple bowel ad-\nenomas \u00035,36\u0004\u0002 the situation becomes more complex and the\ncondition to avoid unlimited growth is given in proposition\nV. Therefore, if \u0002+L\u00050 our results suggest that in the pres-\nence of multiple bowel adenomas the transition to carcinoma\ncannot occur. This conclusion is biologically realistic be-\ncause the net renewal rate of the cells \u0001L+\u00023\u0002 is smaller than\nthe sum of the apoptosis and differentiation rate.\nThe results of propositions II and III can be generalized\nand this is achieved by requiring weaker constraints on the\nproperties of the function F\u0001y\u0002.\nProposition VI. Let F\u0001y\u0002 be a differentiable function de-\nfined in R and \u0007F\u0001y\u0002\u0007\u0005M\u0005+\t. If R\u00060 and \u0002\u0005\u2212M, then\nthe function F\u0001y\u0002+ \u0001R \/y+\u0002\u0002 has at least one positive root.\nProof. The proof follows the same approach as that to\nprove proposition II. Moreover it can be shown that, when\nthe function F\u0001y\u0002+ \u0001R \/y+\u0002\u0002 has a single positive root, the\ncorresponding stationary state of Eqs. \u00019a\u0002\u2013\u00019c\u0002 is stable.\nThe boundedness properties of the corresponding solu-\ntions are defined by the following proposition.\nProposition VII. Let F\u0001y\u0002 be a differentiable function de-\nfined in R and \u0007F\u0001y\u0002\u0007\u0005M\u0005+\t. If \u0002+M\u00050 and x=xeq\n=\u0003 \/k then the solutions of Eqs. \u00019b\u0002 and \u00019c\u0002 are bounded.\nProof. The proof is similar to that of proposition V.\nThe previous results were obtained by assuming a popu-\nlation dependence of the renewal rate of the semidifferenti-\nated cells. We now consider the case when the other rates\nalso exhibit a population dependence. Let us assume that\n\u00023\u0001y\u0002 = \u00023 + F\u0001y\u0002 , \u000112a\u0002\n\u00022\u0001y\u0002 = \u00022 \u2212 H\u0001y\u0002\u0006 0, \u000112b\u0002\n\u00021\u0001y\u0002 = \u00021 \u2212 K\u0001y\u0002\u0006 0, \u000112c\u0002\nwhere the function \u000b\u0001y\u0002 \u0003\u000b\u0001y\u0002\nF\u0001y\u0002 ,H\u0001y\u0002 ,K\u0001y\u0002\u0004 satisfies\nthe properties described in proposition II or VI.\nBy substituting Eqs. \u000112a\u0002\u2013\u000112c\u0002 into Eq. \u00019b\u0002 it follows:\nVARIABLE RENEWAL RATE AND GROWTH PROPERTIES\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 81, 061909 \u00012010\u0002\n061909-7\ndy\ndt\n= \u0002y + Z\u0001y\u0002y + \u00032x, \u0003Z\u0001y\u0002 = F\u0001y\u0002 + H\u0001y\u0002 + K\u0001y\u0002\u0004 .\n\u000113\u0002\nFrom the properties of the functions defining Z\u0001y\u0002, it follows\nthat Eq. \u000113\u0002 is equivalent to Eq. \u00019b\u0002. This implies that the\nproperties of the corresponding dynamical system are\nequivalent to those already discussed.\nV. EFFECTS OF NOISE ON THE DYNAMICS\nOF CELL POPULATIONS\nIn this section the effects of noise on the dynamical be-\nhavior of the cell populations will be investigated. In particu-\nlar, Gaussian white noise is added to the right-hand side of\nEq. \u00013b\u0002 describing the time evolution of the population of\nsemidifferentiated cells, which now reads y\u02d9=\u0002y+ py\nn+1\nq+yn +\u00032x\n+\f\r\u0001t\u0002, where \f is the noise amplitude and \r\u0001t\u0002 is a Gaussian\nstochastic process of zero mean and unit standard deviation.\nThis noisy perturbation is introduced in the system to mimic\nrandom fluctuations arising from internal and external noise.\nWe motivate the introduction of the noise by noting that the\ncontrol of the cellular processes is regulated by the levels of\ngene transcription and the corresponding fluctuations are the\nmain source of the internal noise of the cell \u000341,48,57,58\u0004.\nThe external noise arises from fluctuations of specific factors\nsuch as cell-cell interactions, levels of signaling molecules,\nrate constants of particular biochemical reactions, etc.\n\u000341,59\u0004. Our aim is to understand how these random fluctua-\ntions impact the dynamics of the cell populations. In the\nsimulations the parameter values used are within the range of\nvalues adopted by other authors \u00036,18,38\u0004. Moreover the pa-\nrameter values were selected in order to represent the main\ndynamical regimes described in the theoretical analysis car-\nried out in Sec. III.\nLet us consider the case corresponding to the plot of the\npolynomial P\u0001y\u0002=yn+1\u0001\u0002+ p\u0002+Ryn+\u0002qy+Rq, \u0001R=\u0003\u00032 \/k\u0002\nreported in panel a of Fig. 2. For the adopted parameter\nvalues \u0003=0.5, \u00032=0.1, k=0.1, \u0002=\u22120.3, p=0.35, q=50,\nn=3 the two roots are y1\n\u0001\u000b1.97, y2\n\u0001\u000b3.37. The stationary\nstate S1= \u0001\u0003 \/k ,y1\n\u0001\n,\u00022y1\n\u0001 \/\u0004\u0002 is linearly stable, while S2\n= \u0001\u0003 \/k ,y2\n\u0001\n,\u00022y2\n\u0001 \/\u0004\u0002 is unstable. The top panel of Fig. 4 shows\nplots describing the time evolution of the population of se-\nmidifferentiated cells with different initial conditions in ab-\nsence of noise \u0001\f=0\u0002. When the initial conditions are close\nto the basin of attraction of the stationary state S1 the time\nevolution of the population of semidifferentiated cells con-\nverges to y1\n\u0001\n. When the initial conditions are chosen to fall\nwithin the basin of attraction of S2, then unlimited growth\nwill occur. The inset shows the plot of the corresponding\npolynomial P\u0001y\u0002. The estimation of the tumor doubling time\nfrom these simulations gives a value of about 80 weeks. This\nvalue is within the range of values found for colorectal can-\ncer in human \u0001from 72 to 232 weeks \u000360\u0004\u0002.\nThe case described above has implications from the\nphysiological point of view. In fact the stationary state S1 can\nbe interpreted as the normal homeostatic state in which all\ncell populations are in equilibrium. Let us assume that a\nperturbation of finite duration increases the proliferative rate\nof the population of semidifferentiated cells. Within the\nphysiological analogy, the perturbation acting on the dynami-\ncal system can be interpreted as arising from the alteration of\nsome biochemical processes controlling cell proliferation.\nIn fact, the experimental results on the study of colorectal\ncancers show that about 90% of them occur through\nan alteration of the function of the APC complex\n\u00031,5,13,35,36,61,62\u0004. As discussed the APC complex plays\nan important role in the control of cell proliferation by regu-\nlating the concentration level of \u0002-catenin \u000313\u0004. When the\nAPC complex does not function correctly the \u0002-catenin ac-\ncumulates and an alteration of the cell proliferation rate oc-\ncurs. In particular conditions this situation can degenerate\nleading to the formation of cancer \u00031,5,10,12,13,35,36\u0004.\nThus, the presence of the perturbation will determine the\ntransition S1\u2192S1\u0001\u0001t\u0002. If the nonstationary state S1\u0001\u0001t\u0002 remains\nwithin the basin of attraction of S1 then, a suitable time after\nthe perturbation is turned off, S1\n\u0001\u0001t\u0002\u2192S1. Thus it is expected\nthat if the amplitude and duration of the perturbation are\nbelow threshold, then the cells will be able to recover \u0001due to\nself-regulatory mechanisms\u0002 their original equilibrium. If the\nthreshold is exceeded the initial equilibrium cannot be re-\nstored and unlimited growth occurs. In the middle panel of\nFIG. 4.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 81, 061909 \u00012010\u0002\n061909-8\nFig. 4 are reported the results of the numerical simulations\n\u0001in absence of noise\u0002 of Eqs. \u00013a\u0002\u2013\u00013c\u0002 showing this. In the\nsimulation it was assumed that the perturbation affects the\nself-renewal rate of the semidifferentiated cells: i.e., \u00023\u0001y\u0002\n=\u00023+\npyn\nq+yn +\u000eQp\u0001Ton ,\u000ft\u0002. Qp\u0001Ton ,\u000ft\u0002 is the square pulse\nfunction of unit height starting at t=Ton and of duration \u000ft,\nwhile \u000e is the perturbation amplitude. When the amplitude\nand duration of the perturbation are below the corresponding\nthresholds the population of the semidifferentiated cells in-\ncreases while the perturbation is on, then it returns back to its\nstationary value after some variable time interval. If the \u000e \u0001or\n\u000ft\u0002 value is greater than the threshold then unlimited growth\noccurs \u0001middle panel of Fig. 4\u0002.\nLet us now consider the case in which the semidifferenti-\nated cell population is subject to random fluctuations de-\nscribed by \f\r\u0001t\u0002. We are interested in investigating the ef-\nfects of these fluctuations on the time evolution of the cell\npopulations. A typical trajectory describing the time evolu-\ntion of the population size of the semidifferentiated cells is\nshown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4. Initially the population\nsize fluctuates around the value of yeq corresponding to the\nstationary state S1, then the trajectory enters the basin of\nattraction of the unstable state S2 and unlimited growth oc-\ncurs. To characterize the behavior of the dynamical system\nthe probability P\u0001S1\u2192S2\u0002 of entering the basin of attraction\nof the unstable state was estimated numerically for several\nparameter values. The probability was evaluated as\nNu \/NTrials, where Nu is the total number of times that the\nattraction basin of S2 is crossed by starting from S1; NTrials is\nthe total number of trajectories starting from S1. Several nu-\nmerical experiments were carried out with different values of\nNTrials and they showed that the choice adopted here\n\u0001NTrials=5000\u0002 is an acceptable compromise between statis-\ntical precision and computational cost. The left panel of Fig.\n5 shows the values of P\u0001S1\u2192S2\u0002 plotted against the noise\namplitude for different parameter values. The probability of a\ntransition to S2 increases in a sigmoidal fashion as the noise\namplitude increases. The decrease in the p value \u00010\u0005\u0002+ p\u0002\nrequires higher noise amplitudes for unlimited growth \u0001thin\nblack line\u0002. Keeping p fixed \u00010.35\u0002, the decrease in the self-\nrenewal rate of the stem cell population strongly impacts the\nvalues of the transition probability P\u0001S1\u2192S2\u0002 \u0001gray line\u0002.\nTaken together these results indicate that when there is a\nperturbation of the process driving cellular proliferation the\npresence of noise can determine a transition toward unlim-\nited tissue growth. The left panel of Fig. 5 shows the mean\nexit time \fT\u0001S1\u0002\r plotted against the initial value of the popu-\nlation size of the semidifferentiated cells for different noise\namplitudes. The value of the last quantity was estimated nu-\nmerically as \fT\u0001S1\u0002\r=\n1\nNu\n\u000e j=1\nNu Tj, where Tj is the time required\nto move from S1 to S2. The results show, as expected, that\nthere is a decrease in the mean exit time for increasing values\nof the initial population size.

The top panel of Fig. 6 shows that, in absence of\nnoise \u0001\f=0\u0002, starting with initial conditions close to S2 the\ntime evolution of the population of semidifferentiated cells\ncan reach S1 or S3. In this case therefore there is bistability:\ni.e., the dynamical system evolves toward one of the two\nstable stationary states depending on the initial conditions.\nThe middle panel of Fig. 6 shows a typical trajectory occur-\nring when \f\u00010 and shows that the presence of noise deter-\nmines a switching from the stable state S1 to S3 and vice\nversa. To determine the mean switching time between these\nstates and how it depends on the noise intensity we consider\nhere the case in which at t=0 the state of the dynamical\nsystem is S1. We use numerical simulations to estimate how\nthe mean switching time Ts\u0001S1\u2192S3\u0002 depends on the noise\namplitude. For a fixed value of \f the system of differential\nequations was integrated numerically up to TInt=40\u0010106.\nThen from this trajectory the residence time intervals \u000ftS1\u0001j\u0002\n\u0001j=1,2 , . . . ,M\u0002 in the state S1 were computed and from them\nthe mean switching time from S1 to S3 was estimated as\nTs\u0001S1\u2192S3\u0002= 1M\u000e j\u000ftS1\u0001j\u0002. The results are shown in the bottom\npanel of Fig. 6 \u0001open circles\u0002. The increase in the noise am-\nplitude determines a very fast shortening of the mean switch-\ning time. To characterize the switching phenomenon occur-\nring in this dynamical regime a theoretical analysis was\ncarried out. First of all let us assume that the population of\nstem cells is at equilibrium: i.e., x\u0001t\u0002=xeq=\u0003 \/k. This assump-\ntion makes sense because all simulations were performed by\nstarting from the stationary state S1. However no significant\nchanges occur if x\u0001t\u0002\u0001xeq=\u0003 \/k: it is just sufficient that the\nsampling of the numerical trajectories occurs after t\u0011\u0003\u22121.\nUnder this condition the time evolution of the population of\nthe semidifferentiated cells is described by the following\nequation: y\u02d9=\u2212 dU\u0001y\u0002dy +\f\r\u0001t\u0002, with U\u0001y\u0002=\u2212\u000f\u0003\u0002y+R+F\u0001y\u0002y\u0004dy.\nFrom the theory of stochastic differential equations it\nfollows that the mean exit time from the interval \u0003y1\n\u0001\n,y\u0004\nwhen all trajectories start from y1\u0001 is given by T\u0001y1\u0001 ,y\u0002\n=\n1\n\f2\n\u000fy1\u0001\ny dy\u0001eU\u0001y\u0001\u0002\/\f\n2\n\u000f\n\u2212\t\ny\u0001 dze\u2212U\u0001z\u0002\/\f2 \u000363\u0004. The values of T\u0001y1\n\u0001\n,y\u0002\nwere computed numerically for the case n=3 and the corre-\nsponding results are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 6\n\u0001black line\u0002. The comparison of the theoretical results\n\u0003T\u0001y1\n\u0001\n,y\u0002 values\u0004 with those obtained in the numerical experi-\nments show good agreement.\nSummarizing, the above results indicate that the alteration\nof the proliferative activity of the semidifferentiated cells\n\u0003described by pyn+1 \/ \u0001q+yn\u0002\u0004 can promote bistable behavior\nin the cellular population. Moreover the presence of noise of\nsuitable amplitude determines a switching between these\nstable states. Other numerical simulations were carried out\nby using different parameter values. The corresponding re-\nsults are qualitatively similar to those already discussed\n\u0001results not shown\u0002.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper a continuous nonlinear model describing the\ncell populations in the colonic crypts was studied analyti-\ncally and numerically. Three cell types were considered: the\nstem cells, the semidifferentiated cells, and the fully differ-\nentiated cells. In the first part of the paper we studied how an\nalteration of the renewal rate of the semidifferentiated cells\naffects the growth properties of these cell populations. To\nthis aim it was assumed that the rate of the self-renewal of\nthe semidifferentiated cells was \u00023\u0001y\u0002=\u00023+\npyn\nq+yn \u0001\u0002=\u00023\u2212\u00022\n\u2212\u00021\u0002. It was found that unlimited growth occurs if \u2212p\u0005\u0002\n\u00050. Moreover when \u0002\u0005\u2212p two possible behaviors can oc-\ncur: a single stable stationary state or bistability. The above\ninvestigations were extended by studying the more general\ncase \u00023\u0001y\u0002=\u00023+F\u0001y\u0002 with F\u00010\u0002=0, F\u0001\u0001y\u0002\u00060, and\nlimy\u2192+\tF\u0001y\u0002=L\u0005+\t. It was shown that when L\u0005\u2212\u0002 there\nexists at least one stationary state of the dynamical system.\nMoreover it was shown that when there exists only one sta-\ntionary state then it is globally stable. It was proved that the\nabove results also hold when the function F\u0001y\u0002 satisfies\nweaker constraints. The last part of the paper was devoted to\nthe discussion of the results obtained with numerical simula-\ntions. In particular it was shown that the presence of the\nnoise can lead to unlimited growth of the population of the\nsemidifferentiated cells. Moreover bistability phenomena\nwere found and characterized quantitatively.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nA.D.G. wishes to acknowledge the Centre for Mathemati-\ncal Biology of the Mathematical Institute of the University of\nOxford for its kind hospitality and the Italian National Re-\nsearch Council \u0001CNR\u0002 for financial support.

Let us define G\u0001y\u0002=F\u0001y\u0002+ \u0001\nR\ny +\u0002\u0002: this is\ndifferentiable and continuous in the interval \u00040,+\t\u0003. Let us\nnow prove that G\u0001y\u0002\u00060 for y\u0001 \u00040,y1\u0003= I1.

Now, since G\u0001y\u0002\u00060 in I1 and G\u0001y\u0002\u00050 in I2,\nthe Bolzano theorem implies that the function G\u0001y\u0002 possesses\nat least a root y\u0001 in the interval \u0004y1 ,y2\u0003.\nAPPENDIX B: PROOF OF PROPOSITION III\nProof.

Let g\u0001y\u0002=\u2212\u0001R \/y+\u0002\u0002 and y1=\u2212R \/\u0002, then g\u0001y1\u0002=0\nand F\u0001y1\u0002\u0006g\u0001y1\u0002. Moreover from proposition II it follows\nthat y\u0001\u0006y1. Thus, F\u0001y\u0002\u0006g\u0001y\u0002 in the interval \u0003y1 ,y\u0001\u0003 because\ny\u0001 is the only root of the equation F\u0001y\u0002\u2212g\u0001y\u0002=0.
