How (from a strategic and presentational point of view) and why \nwe do geochemical mapping studies is discussed. \n \nIntroduction \nGeochemical mapping is a technique developed in the 1950s to give information on \nthe spatial distribution of chemical elements and compounds at the Earth\u2019s surface. Its \norigins go back to the Soviet Union (Fersman, 1939) and subsequently applied \nelsewhere for the purposes of mineral exploration, for example Lovering et al. (1950) \nand Hawkes & Bloom (1955).  Regional mapping also found application to issues \nconcerning the environment and health (e.g. Thornton & Webb, 1979 and Plant & \nMoore, 1979). Regional geochemical maps are considered to be a national asset for \nresource evaluation and environmental management and many national surveys have \nbeen undertaken around the world, for example, Johnson et al., 2005 (United \nKingdom); Muchsin et al., 1997 (Sumatra, Indonesia); Sewell, 1999 (Hong Kong); \nReimann et al., 1998 (Barents Region); Vrana et al., 1997 (Slovak Republic) and \nrecently on a continental scale Salminen et al., 2005, (Europe). Procedures for \nregional geochemical mapping are now well established and recommended guidelines \ndocumented (Darnley et al., 1995). \n 1\n These regional geochemical mapping surveys, particularly ones conducted before the \n1990s, generally avoided urban areas as their principal aim was one of mineral \nexploration. Surveys avoided the anthropogenic contamination so as to better attribute \nanomalies to nature\u2019s own form of \u201cnatural contamination\u201d, namely metalliferous \nmineralisation. The British Geological Survey\u2019s (BGS) Geochemical Baseline Survey \nof the Environment (G-BASE) Project illustrates this point well. Regional \ngeochemical samples were collected from Scotland mainly during the 1970s but not \nfrom large urban areas such as Glasgow. As a result there was an empty region in the \ndata for the city of Glasgow, surrounded by a halo of high heavy metal concentrations \n(Figure 1) which at the time was attributed to diffuse pollution around the city.  It was \nnot until 2001 that the city of Glasgow was systematically sampled (Fordyce et al., In \nPrep). \n \nIn the 1980s there was a growing awareness of health risks in urban areas that could \nbe related to the contamination of the environments. For example, the Environmental \nGeochemistry Research Group at Imperial College, London, built on its expertise in \ngeochemical mapping and became involved in projects examining sources, processes \nand effects for some heavy metals (Thornton et al., 1994). Increased environmental \nawareness and the increased funding for such work, connected with a decline in \nexploration interest in developed countries, led to more geochemical mapping studies \nbeing done in urban areas.  \n \nA legislatively driven demand for urban geochemical data in connection with the need \nto identify contaminated land and subsequent health risk assessments has given rise to \na greater worldwide interest in the urban geochemical environment. Examples of such \ninvestigations are listed in Table 1; this does not seek to be a comprehensive list of all \nsurveys done but a representative selection that indicates the methodology in use \nalong with the aims and objectives of such investigations. The importance of knowing \nthis contextual data is discussed later. \nReview of urban geochemical mapping studies \nA literature search for papers on urban geochemical mapping reveals how in the last \ndecade there have been an increasing number of environmental and geochemical \n 2\nstudies of urban areas. Studies of urban areas from Europe predominate with an \nincreasing number of studies reported from Asia in recent years. This is probably a \nreflection of the fact that many cities of Europe have inherited a long industrial \nhistory and an associated legacy of contamination. A similar summary from a trace \nelement perspective is reported in the review of Wong et al. (2006). This review also \nhas a discussion of the development of the discipline of Urban Environmental \nGeochemistry and attributes the term \u201curban geochemistry\u201d to Thornton used to \ndescribe research activities concerning the role of the geochemist at the interface of \nenvironmental geochemistry and urban pollution (Thornton, 1991). \n \nWong et al. (2006) show that Pb continues to be one of the most studied and reported \nelements. Other potentially toxic elements (PTE) such as As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn \nalso commonly feature in urban geochemical mapping. Analytical techniques are used \nthat produce multiple element determinations for a single sample, e.g. X-ray \nfluorescence spectrometry (XRFS), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission \nspectrometry (ICP-AES) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). \nHowever, such methods, depending on what (if any) extraction technique is used, will \ngive results of varying value according to the strength of the extraction and \npredominant mineralogical characteristics of the sample. This is of fundamental \nimportance to end users of the data who, for example, may wish to know how \nbioaccessible a particular element is. Certain elements such as Hg and Se, although as \nimportant as the previously mentioned PTEs, are less frequently reported simply \nbecause the analytical methodology requires greater effort and thus expense. Similarly \norganic compounds, although of equal if not greater importance to the quality of the \nurban environment, are less frequently reported because researchers with traditional \nlinks to regional and exploration mapping do not have the experience, facilities or \nbudget to tackle the more complex field of organic analysis.  \n \nTable 1 shows many common aims and objectives, including: \n\u0083 establishing a baseline for the urban environment \n\u0083 satisfying the legislative-driven demand for geochemical information on the \nurban chemical environment \n\u0083 identifying\/locating polluted areas \n 3\n\u0083 assess the contribution of parent materials and anthropogenic activity to the \ngeochemical baseline \n\u0083 assess risks to other compartments of the urban environment (e.g. groundwater) \n\u0083 identify sources of PTEs \n \nThere is diversity in the detailed sampling and analytical methodologies, which has \nconsequences when it comes to comparing urban baselines (see later discussion). \nThese are issues such as the defined depth for a topsoil and the method of \ncompositing samples at a single site to give a more \u201crepresentative\u201d sample. \n \nStudies can be classified into one of two categories namely systematic urban mapping \nor targeted urban mapping. The characteristics of each class are generalised and \nsummarised in Table 2. Systematic surveys usually provide the catalyst and resources \nfor subsequent targeted studies and are more constrained as to what sample media \nthey can use. If they cover an entire urban area the sample media has to be something \nthat is found everywhere and if the urban area is to be placed in the context of a \nregion then it should be the same as that which the regional survey has used. Soils are \nprobably the most ubiquitous of sample media and are most frequently used in urban \nsurveys. The final point of the summary table considers the type of organisation likely \nto carry out such a survey. This is very much linked to who finances the investigation. \nFinding funding for an urban survey can be every bit as challenging as agreeing on \nthe scientific methodology. The funding process is made more complicated because \nurban studies require a multi-disciplinary approach and it is very difficult \ncoordinating the funding across a diversity of organisations.  \n \nThere is a whole area of data not covered by the classification of  Table 2 or \nconsidered in the summary of Table 1, namely commercial site survey reports. These \nare produced by consultants and are generally only seen by the customers. These too \ngenerate geochemical information but much of this information is considered \nconfidential and never gets further than the client. \n \nThere is also a terminology used in urban geochemical mapping that to non-\ngeochemists would appear confusing and even amongst geochemists themselves \nevokes a divergence of opinions. A feature of urban environmental studies is the \n 4\ninherent multi-disciplinary approach involving, in addition to geochemists, health \nworkers, social scientists, policy makers, city planners and administrative authorities. \nIt is important that as geochemists we use our terminology with clarity and \nconsistency. \nSome Definition of Terms \nUrban area.  We can envisage our environment in terms of two end-points on a line. \nAt one end we have the idea of a pristine environment totally unaffected by human \nactivity - there can be few places on earth that are actually in this state (Yin et al. \n2006). At the other end-point we have intense anthropogenic activity that has a \nlikelihood of leading to contamination. All regions of the earth can be plotted on this \nline with urban areas lying towards the contaminated end point. As geochemical \nsampling strategies for urban and rural areas will be different it is important that \ngeochemists have a means of defining what an urban area is. A search of the internet \nreveals a great range of definitions and one can only conclude that there is no single \ndefinition that meets the needs of all users. Social scientists tend to use population \nnumbers or population density to define urban areas though thresholds will vary from \ncountry to country. In the United Kingdom one definition of an urban area is a \nsettlement having a population >10,000 (Countryside Agency, 2004). The US Census \nBureau defines urbanised areas as having a population > 50,000 (US Census Bureau, \n1995).  \n \nFew of the studies listed in Table 1 give their criteria for defining urban areas. \nPhysical scientists generally approach definitions of urbanisation from the standpoint \nof the built environment (Long et al., 2001). The UK Soil and Herbage Pollutant \nSurvey (Wood et al., 2007) define urban as being an area which is \u226590 per cent \nurbanised\/built up though offers no explanation as what is meant by urbanised or built \nup. A similar method of using built up areas to define an urban area is employed by \nthe G-BASE project (see Figure 2 ). The \u201cbuilt up\u201d ornament on the 1:50,000 scale \n(UK) Ordnance Survey topographic maps is used to define the urban boundary.  \n \nIn some instances the urban boundary may simply be an administrative one and \nprojects are constrained to working with this boundary because collaborating partners \n(e.g. a city council) are restricted to working within it. \n 5\n Urban boundaries tend to be transitional and generally move outwards over relatively \nshort periods of time as settlements grow so it is important to put urban definitions \ninto a historical context. Metropolitan areas, conurbations, urban clusters, urban \ncentres are terms that are used loosely and should be used with care as they have a \nmore specific meaning than the more general term of \u201curban area\u201d. In urban \ngeochemical mapping studies it is important to target areas where there has been some \ndegree of associated anthropogenic activity. Such areas might include extra-urban \nindustrial sites which can be considered as a \u201cbuilt up\u201d area but where resident \npopulation is absent or very low. Purely industrial sites could be classified as a \nseparate category to urban sites as was done in the UK soil and herbage pollutant \nsurvey (Woods et al., 2007). \n \nIt would not be helpful for geochemists to work to a single definition of an urban area. \nEvery human settlement has its own unique set of characteristics which will give rise \nto a unique geochemical baseline. The important thing is that urban geochemical \nstudies report the criteria used (as discussed above) to define the spatial extent of the \ninvestigation.  \n \nGeochemical Baseline.  The term geochemical baseline is now in widespread use in \nthe geochemical literature. This is a reflection of the shift away from geochemical \nmapping's previously principal use in mineral exploration to environmental \napplications. The processes driving the need for geochemical baselines are described \nin global initiatives such as the FOREGS (Forum of European Geological Surveys) \nEuropean geochemical baseline project  (Plant et al., 1997, and Salminen et al., 1998). \nThe International Geological Correlation Programme (IGCP) Project 259 \"The global \ngeochemical database for environmental and resource management\" (Darnley et al., \n1995) ended in 1994 and was succeeded by IGCP Project 360. For the IGCP project \ninternationally agreed protocols and procedures for geochemical baseline mapping \nwere developed. Salminen & Tarvainen (1997) attribute the official introduction of \nthe term geochemical baseline to the IGCP 360 project.  However, as discussed by \nSalminen & Gregorauskiene (2000), the term geochemical baseline was not well \ndefined.  \n \n 6\nTidball et al. (1974) used the term baseline in connection with sagebrush and soils \nfrom Montana Wyoming, USA and this was a statistical definition based on the \ncentral 95% of recorded values. Another earlier use of the term baseline in the context \nof geochemical mapping is that of Davenport et al. (1993) applied to geochemical \nmapping in Newfoundland and Labrador as a measurement of environmental change.  \n \nThe following definition of a geochemical baseline is based on that used by the Forum \nof European Geological Surveys (FOREGS) Geochemical Baseline Mapping Group: \n\u201cA Geochemical baseline is the concentration at a specific point in time of a \nchemical parameter (element, species or compound) in a sample of geological \nmaterial. It is a fluctuating surface rather than a given value\u201d. \n \nThe geochemical baseline of element\/compound X can be defined as a function of the \nmethodology used to determine it: \nBaseline X = f {A, B, C, D}  \nfor 1 to n samples from different locations at a specified point in time where A is a \ndefined media type, B a documented sampling method, C a documented sample \npreparation protocol, and D a documented analytical method. \n \nDefining the baseline as a function in this way emphasises the need to standardise \nmethodologies. One baseline can only be truly compared with another if all the \nmethods used are the same. However, there are techniques that can be used to level \nand normalise one baseline data set with another (Darnley et al., 1995). The UK \nG-BASE project has been baseline mapping since the late 1960s during which time \nanalytical methods have changed, yet the project is still able to produce a seamless \ngeochemical baseline for regional and urban areas as a result of its data conditioning \nprocedures (Johnson et al., 2005 and Johnson et al., In Press).  \n \nThe geochemical baseline is defined at a specific point in time. For regional \ngeochemical mapping in areas of little anthropogenic activity, with the exception of \ncatastrophic events such as volcanic eruptions or extensive flooding, the baseline \nchanges slowly in response to natural changes in an order of magnitude of decades or \ncenturies. Changes to the urban geochemical baseline as a result of constant \n 7\nanthropogenic activity would be anticipated as being more rapid so the time \ncomponent is a more important factor. \n \nThe formal definition of a baseline makes the concept appear more complicated than \nit is. A geochemical baseline simply reports the chemical state of the surface \nenvironment exactly as it is with no interpretation or partitioning of the data. A \nbaseline is often qualified by a term based on the sampling medium or region of \nsampling, e.g. urban soil geochemical baseline or regional stream sediment \ngeochemical baseline. \n \nBackground. Another frequently used term is geochemical background, a term \nfamiliar to those with experience in geochemical exploration in which it was \nimportant to partition the geochemical baseline into a background and anomaly. In the \ncontext of the urban environment the geochemical background can be defined as: \n\u201cA relative measure to distinguish between natural element or compound \nconcentrations and anthropogenically-influenced concentrations in real sample \ncollectives\u201d (Matschullat et al., 2000). This can be expressed as a simple equation: \n \nBASELINE = BACKGROUND + Anthropogenic Contribution \n \nThis is a simplification because the background may be made up of many contributing \ngeochemical populations (caused by variations in underlying parent material, for \nexample) and the anthropogenic contribution can also be from multiple sources. \nDefinition of the background enables us to quantify the urban contamination. (see \nlater section). Background, unlike a baseline, is determined by interpreting or \nmodelling the data. \n \nGuideline or Intervention values. Urban geochemical mapping studies will often put \ntheir data for potentially toxic elements or compounds in the context of guideline or \nintervention values in order to delineate areas where there is a potential risk to health. \nIn the UK Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment (CLEA) soil guideline values \n(SGV) (DEFRA-EA, 2002a) are now often cited (see Table 3). Other \nguideline\/intervention values are cited for other countries as part of legislation for \nidentifying contaminated land that might pose a risk to health (cite Jaana Java\u2019s New \n 8\nOrlean\u2019s SEGH presentation if in this volume). SGVs represent an intervention value \nwhich if exceeded indicate potentially unacceptable risks to site users. If the SGVs are \nexceeded then this might suggest that further investigations and\/or remedial action \nmay be required to protect human health.  Such guideline or intervention values are \ndetermined by establishing authoritative health criteria values for each contaminant \nthrough a review of scientific literature. \n \nHow we do Urban Geochemical Mapping Studies \nTable 1 gives an indication of the methods used for urban geochemical mapping and \nmore details of methodology can be found in the cited references. This section on how \nwe do geochemical mapping studies is more concerned with strategy and presentation \nthan the details of methods. In connection with strategy, the first point that must be \nemphasised is that no two urban areas are the same and any strategy for mapping an \nurban area must consider the history of urbanisation and industrialisation in addition \nto its geographical setting. Opportunities for soil sampling in an intensively built up \narea such as Hong Kong will be far fewer than say in Nottingham (UK) where houses \nare more likely to have gardens. Similarly, a shallow dry stony soil, say from a \nMediterranean region, will be more easily collected with a trowel or spade than a well \ndeveloped soil from the northern temperate zone that can easily be collected with a \n1 m soil auger. Whilst it is useful to have a generic guide to geochemical mapping \n(Darnley et al. 1995), methodology for urban areas cannot be too prescriptive in order \nto account for the diversity of conditions that go into the make up of an urban \nenvironment. \n \nWhilst it may be difficult to compare urban areas on a continental scale it is desirable \nto be able to compare them on a national scale. Any strategy for sampling an urban \narea must be designed with the end users of the data in mind. For example, if the \nurban baseline is to be used to define contaminated land that poses a risk to health \nthen the geochemical baseline mapping should use the same sample media and \nanalytical methodology that has been used to define the legislative guideline values. \nThere is little point using, for example, roadside dust determined following a weak \nacid extraction if health risks have to be put into the context of soil guideline values \nfor total element concentrations. Conversely, it is an important role of targeted \n 9\ngeochemical mapping to highlight the inappropriateness of guideline\/intervention \nvalues based on total element concentrations when it is the bioaccessible fraction of \nan element that may be more important when considering the impact on human \nhealth. \n \nThis section opened with a statement that recommendations for urban geochemical \nmapping should not be too prescriptive on account of the diversity of urban make up \nparticularly on a continental scale. However, there is a need for guidelines on how to \nconduct urban sampling and subsequent chemical analyses. Table 1 summarises some \nof the more important aspects of the methodologies and these are categorised as \nfollows. \nSampling and Analytical Strategy \nSample Media. Soil is the most widely used sample media particularly for systematic \nsampling of complete urban areas. As many targeted studies have been in connection \nwith vehicle pollution, roadside dust is also a frequently reported sample medium. \nDrainage sediments are not as widely used as in non-urban studies mainly on account \nof their artificial and inaccessible nature (e.g. underground water culverts) in built-up \nenvironments. Studies that have used drainage sediments (e.g. Fordyce et al. 2004) are \nable to better consider movement of contaminants between the different urban \nenvironmental compartments. Tree bark and attic\/house dusts (e.g. Tye et al. 2006) \ncan be used for targeted studies involving atmospheric transport of contaminants. \nAtmospheric levels of elements and compounds are rarely reported in geochemical \njournals and research tends to be done by other disciplines. This point illustrates the \nneed for greater inter-disciplinary cooperation particularly in studying the movement \nof chemicals and compounds between the different compartments of the urban \nenvironment which will be represented by different sample media. \nSoil Sampling Depth. Urban soil sampling tends to use a depth rather than horizon \nbased approach on account of the poor development of soil horizons in many urban \nsoils. Surface soils or \u201ctopsoils\u201d are generally collected from 0-10 cm but may or may \nnot include the surface organic litter or root zone. \u201cDeep\u201d or \u201cProfile\u201d soils are \ngenerally collected from >35 cm usually for the purpose of establishing a relationship \nwith parent material or using results in the context of a regional baseline. \n 10\nSoil Fraction. Use of the <2 mm fraction of soil samples is now widespread, although \nsome studies have reported finer fractions mainly to be consistent with earlier regional \nwork. Gentle disaggregation of samples to make sure fine particles are not lost \nbecause they are aggregated is an essential part of the sample preparation process, and \nmay make a significant difference to results if not carried out.  \nSoil Representativity. It is generally accepted that the origin and history of urban soils \nleads to a greater heterogeneity than in non-urban areas and sampling strategies \nusually involve sampling at a higher density to capture more of the between site \nvariability. In order to deal with \u201cwithin site\u201d variability most investigations will \ncreate a composited sample though procedures vary both in the number of composite \nsamples (generally 3 to 9 sub-samples) or the area and shape of sampling zone (see \nTable 1).  \n \nIn urban areas the G-BASE project collects four duplicate pairs (i.e. eight samples) \nfrom every one hundred sites and these are split in the laboratory to give replicates. \nUsing nested ANOVA analysis the variance \u201cbetween sites\u201d, \u201cwithin sites\u201d and \n\u201cwithin samples\u201d can be quantified (Johnson et al., In Press). A successful sampling \nand analytical  strategy would expect at least 80% of the variance to be attributed to \n\u201cbetween sites\u201d (Ramsey et al. 1992). It is important that urban studies should \nquantify variance for each analyte in this way, particularly studies collecting small \namounts of material, say for example in soils over a very restricted (several \ncentimetres) depth of sampling.  \n \nA nested sampling investigation by the G-BASE project  to look at the optimum soil \nsampling density (Rawlins & Brown, 2002) has also provided information on element \nvariance captured over varying distances. This work showed that elements associated \nwith anthropogenic contamination require shorter sampling intervals to capture their \nvariance than do the geogenic elements (that is those elements associated with the \nunderlying parent material). \n \nSample Analysis. The most significant divergence in reporting geochemical data from \nurban areas relates as to whether results are total analyses (XRFS or neutron \nactivation (NA)), near total (four acid attack (Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), Perchloric \nAcid (HClO4), Nitric Acid (HNO3) and Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)) during extraction \n 11\nprocedure), or partial (great variety of methods designed to identify various \ncomponents of a total analyses, particularly relating to bioaccessibility). It is very \nimportant that the method of analysis is borne in mind when comparing urban \nbaselines and when the data is placed in the context of guideline\/intervention values. \n \nPresenting Baseline Data \nAn important component of urban geochemical mapping studies is how we present \nour baseline data. The increasing number of urban investigations has coincided with a \nperiod of growth in the power of desktop computing and the availability of more user-\nfriendly Geographical Information System (GIS) software applications such as \nArcGIS and MapInfo. An important outcome of urban geochemical studies is a GIS \nproject in which the multi-disciplinary components can be represented in the different \nlayers and readily interrogated. The GIS is dependent on a well constructed and \nquality controlled digital data set. The importance of geochemical databases cannot be \nunderestimated, they enforced a high degree of data standardisation and preserve the \nresults for use in future investigations. The G-BASE project contributes its results to \nthe corporate BGS Geochemistry Database (Coats & Harris, 1995), a database \ncontaining some half-a-million samples and eight million analyte determinations. \nGiven that a geochemical sample costs something between US $100 \u2013 $200 to collect, \nprepare and analyse such a database is an asset of considerable value. \n \nIn publications the baseline data can simply be presented as a table of data or more \nsatisfactorily as a geochemical map or interpolated image. A baseline is data \npresented with the minimum of interpretation and the interpolated geochemical \nimages such as that shown in Figure 1 based on a percentile classification is a \ncommon form of presentation. Care has to be taken in the presentation of geochemical \ndata for urban areas as lack of understanding as to what an interpolated images shows \ncan lead to property being blighted unreasonably particularly if inappropriate gridding \nparameters have been used. For this reason the G-BASE project prefers to present \nbaseline geochemical data for urban areas as classified symbol maps (Figure 3) and it \nis repeatedly emphasised that the nature of the survey is one of investigating regional \ntrends rather than site specific investigations. \n \n 12\nBaseline data can be informatively presented in a graphical manner and techniques \nused to give visual comparisons between different urban baselines. Histograms, box \nand whisker plots (Figure 4) and cumulative frequency probability plots are a few \nexamples (Figure 5). The box and whisker plot can be used to classify baseline data \n(e.g. by underlying parent material) to aid interpretation. The cumulative frequency \nprobability plot (Sinclair, 1976) is particularly informative because it not only gives \nan immediate visual impression of the data range and multi-modal distribution  but it \ncan also be used to partition data to establish background and contaminated areas. \n \nWhy we do urban Geochemical Mapping Studies \nAccording to the 2005 revision of the United Nations World Urbanisation prospects \nreport (UN, 2006) 3.2 billion people lived in urban areas in 2005, a figure which will \ngrow by 2008 to surpass to world\u2019s rural population. Sixty percent of the world\u2019s \npopulation is expected to live in cities by 2030. In developed countries with a history \nof urbanisation and industrialisation going back many centuries the percentage of \nurban population is higher, as is the legacy of industrial contamination. This legacy \narose from times when we were unaware as to the many health impacts of \nurbanisation combined with an attitude that economic development was more \nimportant than the quality of life and health of the population. It is because we now \nlive in more enlightened times in which we and responsible governments are \nconcerned about our health, the quality of our lives and environmental sustainability \nthat we do urban geochemical mapping studies. \n \nThe American Minerals Information Institute1 estimates that every American will \nneed 3.7 million pounds (1.68 x 106 kg) of minerals, metals and fuels during their \nlifetime. If one imagines several generations and ponders where the materials come \nfrom, where they are processed and where they are used and disposed of, then it is no \nsurprise that anthropogenic activity significantly modifies the chemical environment \nof urban areas. \n \nUrban areas are associated with many problems that impact on human health and life. \nWhy should resources be spent on doing geochemical mapping when, say for \n                                                 \n1 www.mii.org \n 13\nexample, a bigger priority might be preventing people getting run over and killed by \ncars on city street? Geochemists must be able to justify their reasons for doing such \ninvestigations if they are to expect support for their work. Mapping that just shows an \nurban area is contaminated by anthropogenic activity, something that can easily be \npredicted, is insufficient reason alone. Outcomes must demonstrate that the work \nleads to an improvement in the health and quality of life of the local population and a \nmore sustainable local environment. \n \nPart of the problem is a general lack of understanding amongst the general public and \nthose responsible for their urban environment of the impact of the chemical \nenvironment on human health and the quality of life. Chemical hazards are not seen in \nthe same way as physical hazards. People notice subsiding buildings, the damage to \nproperty through flooding, earthquake and volcanic eruptions, hazards that effect \nproperty. They are not so aware of the silent and less visible effects of cancer causing \nradon and arsenic, or the mental impairment through excessive exposure to lead or \nmercury or even a lack of iodine in the diet. Chemical hazards impact more directly \non people than property so it might be expected that people should be more \nconcerned. Geochemists must learn to communicate the hazards of the chemical \nenvironment in a way people can understand. After all, the risks of the chemical \nenvironment are more predictable than events such as hurricanes, flooding and \nearthquakes and more readily mitigated. \n \nUnfortunately, it takes catastrophic events to highlight the importance of knowing the \ngeochemical baseline, events such as the Chernobyl (Ukraine) nuclear accident in \n1986, the flooding of New Orleans (USA) in 2005, or the Buncefield oil refinery fire \n(UK) in 2005. All these events have used pre-event baseline information to assess and \nunderstand the post-catastrophe impact. If not a catastrophic event it usually takes \nlegislation before urban authorities believe they have a requirement for geochemical \ndata. There was a significant increase in the licencing of G-BASE baseline data by \nlocal authorities following the introduction of the Environmental Protection Act Part \nIIA (DETR, 2000) in the UK in April 2000. \n \nThere is little doubt that some of the pioneering work done by the founders of the \nSociety for Environmental Geochemistry and Health, particularly with regard to lead \n 14\nin the urban environment, has resulted in a more healthy urban environment and \ngreater protection of our children from lead poisoning. Geochemical mapping studies \nwill continue to bring new issues to the forefront, e.g. Arsenic and Polychlorinated \nBiphenyls (PCBs) (Reference to Rolf Ottensen\u2019s work in Norway presented at SEGH \nNew Orleans conference if included in this volume). \n \nTargeted urban studies have a role to identify and understand the chemical hazards of \nour urban environment whilst the systematic studies can help policy makers and \nlegislators to use more appropriate intervention values. By systematic surveying we \ncan identify areas at risk that otherwise would not have been predicted (e.g. \ncontaminated fenland in NW England, Breward (2004)). Systematic surveys also have \nthe potential to estimate levels of diffuse pollution added to the urban environment \nthrough anthropogenic activity (Rawlins et al., 2005) and can demonstrate \nanthropogenic impact by subtracting the extra-urban baseline (used to define natural \nbackground) away from the urban baseline (Tarvainan et al., 2006 or Jaana Java\u2019s \nNew Orlean\u2019s SEGH presentation if in this volume). \n \nThe purpose of urban geochemical mapping is a long term goal to understand and \nimprove our knowledge of the urban environment rather than to have short-term \noutcomes. A cost benefit analysis would demonstrate that the money saved nationally \non the need to inappropriately remediate land defined as contaminated by poor \nlegislation would far outweigh the cost of carrying out a national urban geochemical \nsurvey. Such mapping provides the information to give more appropriate \nguideline\/intervention values. For example, the UK Association of Geotechnical and \nGeoenvironmental Specialists (AGS) estimate that over a fifteen year period (2001-\n2016) remediation of brownfield sites is likely to cost within the range \u00a32billion to \n\u00a36.75billion (US $ 4 to US $ 13.5billion) (AGS, 2006). A substantial proportion of \nthe sites where remediation is taking place fall into the category where concentrations \nof toxic compounds such as lead and arsenic fall slightly above the SGV. A \nsignificant cost for risks that might be considered tolerable or minimal. \n \n 15\nConclusions \n1. Geochemical studies of urban environments have grown in importance relative to \nthe historical application of geochemical mapping to mineral exploration. \n2. The last decade has seen an increase in urban geochemical mapping particularly in \nEurope where a long industrial history has left a legacy of contamination in many \ncities. \n3. Whilst the diversity of the make up of urban areas worldwide would prevent an \noverly prescriptive approach to urban geochemical mapping, it is important that \nthere are guidelines more detailed than the generic recommendations of Darnley et \nal. (1995) to assist in greater standardisation of methodologies in urban studies. An \nestimation of  the anthropogenic contribution to the baseline is more easily done if \nan urban survey uses the same methods as employed in the regional baseline \nmapping. \n4. Urban geochemical mapping studies can generally be classified as either being \nsystematic surveys or targeted surveys. The former tend to be done by national \norganisations and will involve 100s or 1000s of samples. The targeted surveys are \nmore likely to be done by university and research institutes. \n5. Urban studies require a multi-disciplinary approach and geochemists must learn to \ncommunicate their work and results to non-geochemists in a more comprehensible \nmanner. Definitions of what an urban area is, geochemical baseline and \nbackground, and guideline\/intervention values need to be used with greater clarity. \n6. Urban geochemical studies need to have better defined outcomes than just \ndemonstrating that an urban area is contaminated. They should have a long term \ngoal of improving the health, quality of life and sustainability of the environment. \n7. It is unfortunate that it takes catastrophic events or legislation to demonstrate the \nvalue of baseline geochemical data. Geochemists need to do more to highlight the \nrisks of the chemical environment which are less obvious, though more \ncontrollable than physical hazards. \n8. Baseline data for urban areas, particularly if used in the context of the regional \nbaseline, can be used to assist policy makers and legislators create better legislation \nwith more appropriate guideline\/intervention values. \n \n \n 16\nAcknowledgement \nThis paper is published with the permission of the Director of the British Geological \nSurvey (NERC).
