Powerlessness and Perceptual Discrimination 20 Footnotes 1 In all experiments, manipulation checks confirmed the effectiveness of the power primes (all Fs  > 2.0). 2 Study 1 found larger differences in response latencies for difficult as compared to easy discriminations. In Study 2, the effects of power did not differ reliably between the two distractor conditions (5 vs. 11). This is not necessarily unexpected. Manipulating the level of difficulty (Study 1) made the discriminations considerably harder (Mserror = 1% vs. 32%; SDserror = 2% vs. 8%), but manipulating the set size (Study 2) had only a comparably small effect (Mserror = 7% vs. 9%; SDserror = 5% vs. 6%). Thus, although the response latencies showed steep set size slopes, evidence for serial search, adding non-targets to the display had only a small effect on the difficulty of discriminating targets from non-targets.
