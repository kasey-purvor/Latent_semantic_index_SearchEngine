Introduction\n[2] Ribbed moraines (Figure 1) are prominent landforms\nwhich cover extensive areas of the beds of palaeo-ice sheets\n[Ha\u00a8ttestrand and Kleman, 1999; Dunlop and Clark, 2006a].\nSince the late 1800s a wide range of interpretations have\nbeen offered which place their formation in a variety of\nglaciodynamic settings ranging from ice marginal or near\nmarginal positions [Fro\u00a8din, 1913, 1925; Ho\u00a8gbom, 1920;\nBeskow, 1935] to formation under stagnant ice [e.g.,\nLundqvist, 1951; Mannerfelt, 1945; Kurimo, 1980]. How-\never, these views have been superseded by the recognition\nthat they formed subglacially [Hoppe, 1952; Lundqvist,\n1969; Bouchard, 1989; Aylsworth and Shilts, 1989;\nHa\u00a8ttestrand and Kleman, 1999]. This view has important\nimplications for our understanding of ice sheet stability,\nbecause the same processes that generate ribbed moraines\nmust logically influence ice sheet motion. Consequently,\nan understanding of their genesis is of relevance to our\nknowledge of ice sheet dynamics.\n[3] This concept however is complicated by the fact that\nthere is no consensus on their formation. Numerous com-\npeting hypotheses have been presented, some of which\nfavor a monogenetic origin, i.e., ribbed moraine are pro-\nduced by a single formative mechanism [e.g., Shaw, 1979;\nBouchard, 1989; Aylsworth and Shilts, 1989; Fisher and\nShaw, 1992; Ha\u00a8ttestrand, 1997; Hindmarsh, 1998a, 1998b,\n1999] while others offer a polygenetic interpretation invok-\ning separate stages of development [Lundqvist, 1989, 1997;\nBoulton, 1987; Mo\u00a8ller, 2006; Sarala, 2006]. A longstanding\nview of ribbed moraines has been that they are initiated by a\ncompressive stress field operating at the glacier sole which\nacts to shear and stack debris-rich basal ice or basal debris\ninto sequences of subglacial shear planes producing ridges\n[e.g., Kurimo, 1977;Minell, 1977, 1980; Shilts, 1977; Shaw,\n1979; Bouchard, 1989; Aylsworth and Shilts, 1989]. There\nare differing views on the conditions responsible for gener-\nating the stresses and on the glaciodynamic setting of ridge\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, F03005, doi:10.1029\/2007JF000954, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1School of Environmental Sciences, University of Ulster, Coleraine,\nUK.\n2Department of Geography, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.\n3Physical Science Division, British Antarctic Survey, Natural\nEnvironment Research Council, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JF000954$09.00\nF03005 1 of 15\ndevelopment. A concise review of the various ideas is\ngiven by Ha\u00a8ttestrand and Kleman [1999]. Fisher and\nShaw [1992] argue that ribbed moraines are formed by\nthe deposition and reworking of sediments in large ripple\ncavities that were shaped by subglacial megafloods.\nHa\u00a8ttestrand [1997] suggests a boudinage mechanism\nwhereby a frozen till sheet is fractured and extended into\nridges, while others favor a deforming bed mechanism\n[Boulton, 1987; Hindmarsh, 1998a, 1998b, 1999]. The\npolygenetic hypotheses all argue that glacial processes\nreshape preexisting ridge structures into ribbed moraine\nridges. However, there is disagreement regarding the origin\nof the precursor ridges. Boulton [1987] argued that glacial\nlineations from an earlier glacial stage could act as pre-\ncursor ridges that would be subsequently reshaped into\nribbed moraines following a change of flow direction\n(through \u000190\u0001). Lundqvist [1989, 1997] argued the wide\nvariety of sediment and internal structures pointed toward a\ntwo-step model, but did not specify the origin of the\nprimary ridges. Mo\u00a8ller [2006] argues that the precursor\nridges were deposited from ice cored moraines in an ice\nmarginal setting. A recent model proposed by Sarala\n[2006] shares similarities with the Ha\u00a8ttestrand [1997]\nhypothesis in that the primary ridge structures are produced\nwhen a preexisting frozen till sheet is fractured into\nsequences of protoridges. However, a boudinage mecha-\nnism is not favored and an alternative process is proposed\nin which fracturing is initiated during cold based condi-\ntions when ice flow was accommodated by internal defor-\nmation. This is thought to initiate a sequence of folds in the\nbasal ice and frozen till sheet which develops into cracks\nunder extensional flow. This continues until the bedrock\nsurface or area of weakness in the drift sheet is intercepted\nby a rising phase change (melting) surface which promotes\nsliding at these points and detachment of the ribs.\n[4] The theory by Hindmarsh [1998a, 1998b, 1999]\ndiffers markedly from the above qualitative and case-specific\nconceptual models in that it is the only quantitative\nexplanation of ribbed moraine genesis. It contains a\nnumerical development of the theory of landform genera-\ntion by deformable bed mechanisms [Boulton, 1987], and\nmodels the behavior of an ice sheet sliding over a\ndeforming bed. The theory, herein referred to as the Bed\nRibbing Instability Explanation (BRIE), takes a linearized\napproach and predicts the conditions where amplification\nof relief in the sediment surface (i.e., landscape formation)\ncan be initiated in deforming subglacial till. The mathe-\nmatical details and procedures are given by Hindmarsh\n[1998a, 1998b, 1999]. This contribution appears signifi-\ncant because it is the first process-based theory of subgla-\ncial bedform generation, in that it incorporates the actual\nphysics required, and which makes predictions that can be\nquantitatively tested. However, since its formulation in the\nlate 1990s, such testing has not been possible owing to\nthe paucity of data on ribbed moraine characteristics. This\nshortfall has been recently addressed and there now exists\na representative database on ribbed moraine characteristics\n[Dunlop and Clark, 2006a] which can be used to attempt a\nfalsification of the BRIE. Here we introduce the concepts\nthat underpin the theory, describe the model and discuss\nthe types of model tests that are currently possible. Model\nruns are compared against known ribbed moraine charac-\nteristics and an assessment is made on how well the model\nis able to reproduce the primary features of this landform,\nand especially with regard to their scale.\n2. Instability Mechanisms\n[5] It is now well documented that ribbed moraines\noccur widely over the beds of the former Fennoscandian,\nLaurentide and Irish ice sheets [e.g., Prest et al., 1968;\nHa\u00a8ttestrand, 1997; Knight and McCabe, 1997; Dunlop and\nClark, 2006a, 2006b]. Recent investigations of ribbed\nmoraines in these regions have established a characteristic\nand widely repeated patterning, and although the scale of\nthe ridges vary, ridge morphology is fairly consistent\nbetween the different ice sheets [Dunlop and Clark,\n2006a]. Morphometric measures of ridge length, height,\nwidth and wavelength (i.e., spacing between ridge center\npoints along the direction of flow) have shown that each\nparameter has a unimodal distribution and in particular that\nthe ridges have a preferred wavelength within a field\n[Dunlop and Clark, 2006a]. We argue that this consistency\nin form and pattern, coupled with the unimodal distribu-\ntions, is indicative of a single formational mechanism which\noperated widely at the base of these ice sheets. Similar\nconsistency in pattern is common in nature, where there\nare features that are widespread, repetitive and organized\ninto dominant wavelengths (Figure 2). Such wave pattern\nformations in natural systems are frequently driven by\ninstabilities (i.e., a mechanism that can amplify small\ndisturbances in the system) and it is well established, for\nexample, in aeolian and fluvial geomorphology, that dunes\nand other bedforms are created through an instability\ngenerated by the interaction of the fluid flow with the\nunderlying bed [e.g., Hersen et al., 2004; Elbelrhiti et al.,\n2005; Komarova and Hulscher, 2000]. Other examples are\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor instability which occurs any time a\ndense heavy fluid is being accelerated by a light fluid\n[Sharp, 1984], the Kelvin Helmholtz instability which\ndrives some cloud formations [Drazen, 2002] and the\nFigure 1.

Arrow indicates direction of ice flow.\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n2 of 15\nF03005\nRayleigh-Be\u00b4nard instability, which is known to control\nconvection plumes in fluids [Getling, 1997]. Since ribbed\nmoraines display pattern characteristics that are similar to\nother instability phenomena, we argue that the primary\nmechanism of ribbed moraine genesis is an instability and\nare simply extending this idea to the flow of ice over a\ndeforming substrate. We essentially appeal to the fact\nthat ribbed moraines look like waves superimposed on the\nregional topography [seeClark andMeehan, 2001, Figure 4],\nand as they are composed of subglacial material [e.g.,\nLundqvist, 1969; Shaw, 1979; Wattenson, 1983; Bouchard,\n1989], that they are produced by an instability mechanism\nthat can amplify small disturbances in the flow, erosion or\ndeposition of till in the subglacial environment.\n[6] In nature, any nearly uniform (i.e., not changing\nsignificantly with position in at least one of the three\npossible directions) field is subject to random forcing. Here\nthe term \u2018\u2018field\u2019\u2019 is used to represent a property of the\nsystem which varies with position \u2013 for example till\nthickness, sand thickness, air moisture content. Consider\nsand ripples which are created where sand is being trans-\nported by currents. The current is never constant, but varies\nin time as a result of wave action and wind action. This\nmeans that the rate of sediment transport varies in time. The\nvariability of the rate of sediment transport is complicated\nand we can consider it to be some kind of a random process.\nFor subglacial sediments, the randomness is perhaps due to\nvariations in the till lithology, subglacial water pressure etc.\n[7] In the somewhat restricted technical sense used here,\na system is unstable when it acts to amplify small dis-\nturbances. This means that some manner of positive feed-\nback is operating. If the system is unstable, then small\nnatural variations (perturbations) which occur as a result of\nthe forcing, become larger through the operation of positive\nfeedback, eventually disrupting the near uniformity of the\nfield. For example, on an initially flat sand surface on a\nbeach, a small protuberance (i.e., variation in the sand\nthickness) encourages local sediment accretion and the\nprotuberance consequently grows. If a pattern or wave is\nto form, these disturbances must have a preferred horizontal\nscale, i.e., a wavelength. Such an instability generally grows\nexponentially with time at least initially and in practice\ngrows fastest at a particular preferred wavelength, called the\nwavelength of maximum growth rate (Figure 3). This\nwavelength is determined by the physical operation of the\nsystem. There is no absolute principle which says that there\nmust be such a wavelength, but in practice there almost\nalways is \u2013 otherwise we would not observe any patterns.\nFor example, if the wavelength of maximum growth rate of\na sand ripple were larger than the beach, we would see no\nripple.\n[8] It is a very general property of small perturbations that\nthey grow exponentially with time. As a consequence of the\nexponential growth, a perturbation with the preferred wave-\nlength soon comes to dominate, and a pattern forms with\nFigure 2. (top) Transverse sand ripples formed on a river\nbed arising from an instability in the coupled flow of water\nand sand. Note that two wavelengths of bedforms exist\npresumably resulting from different flow stages of the river.\n(bottom) Transverse cloud formations organized into\ndominant wavelength, and also arising from an instability\nmechanism.\nFigure 3. Schematic illustration of the wavelength\ndependency of instabilities. Graph shows growth rate of\ninstability plotted against wavelength. Where the growth\nrate is negative, a small perturbation will decay. If there are\nwavelengths where the growth rate is positive (as illustrated\nin this example) small perturbations grow in size and the\nsystem is unstable. In general the system evolves into a\npatterned state with a dominant wavelength around the\nwavelength of maximum growth rate. The detailed physical\noperation of the system determines the wavelength of\nmaximum growth rate.\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n3 of 15\nF03005\nscales around this wavelength. Eventually, processes that\nprevent further growth of the instability start to operate, and\na new steady patterned form may be reached (see examples\nin Figure 2). Of course, waves grow at wavelengths other\nthan the wavelength of maximum growth rate, but the net\neffect of all these waves combined is a wave with wave-\nlength around the wavelength of maximum growth rate\n(Figure 4).\n[9] Several workers have now demonstrated mathemati-\ncally that instabilities can be generated in subglacially\ndeforming till [Hindmarsh, 1998a, 1998b, 1998c; Fowler,\n2000; Schoof, 2007]. This theory joins a large volume of\ninstability theories that have successfully explained patterns\nin nature [e.g., Philips, 1993; Ashton et al., 2001; Yamamoto\net al., 2003] and is an appealing idea because it eliminates\nthe requirement for specific localized conditions to be in\nplace before ribbed moraines can be generated. A charac-\nteristic feature of instabilities is that they produce the same\npattern repeatedly. We would therefore expect an instability\nthat operated in the subglacial zone to manifest itself\nrepeatedly, and in a similar fashion beneath various ice\nsheets and places. If the system is inherently unstable, then\none would expect the instability to operate over large areas\nof that system.\n3. Historical Development of the BRIE\n[10] Hindmarsh [1998a, 1998b, 1998c] was the first\nworker to demonstrate mathematically that instabilities can\nbe generated in a deforming bed. The physical basis of this\ninstability stems from the fact that the rheology of till is\nhypothesized to depend upon the effective pressure. In\nsubglacial till, effective pressure is the amount by which\nthe overburden pressure, due to the overlying ice and\nsediment, exceeds the pore water pressure and is an index\nof how strongly the till grains are pushed together. The\neffective pressure is important in till mechanics because it\ndetermines the overall strength of the sediment. As effective\npressure decreases, the till becomes less cohesive, allowing\nmore frequent and rapid episodes of deformation. The\neffective pressure is also affected by the pressure exerted\non the till by the flowing ice. To add a greater degree of\nrealism, the theory was extended to include sliding at the\nice\/till and till\/bed interfaces [Hindmarsh, 1999]. Fowler\n[2000] using the same physical principles as Hindmarsh\n[1998a, 1998b, 1998c] also demonstrated the existence of\nsuch an instability. Both Hindmarsh [1998a, 1998b, 1998c]\nand Fowler [2000] suggested that drumlins were formed as\nthe result of the instability, but this was a somewhat\noptimistic extrapolation of their theories, which at that\ntime had only considered two-dimensional plane flow (i.e.,\nunidirectional flow in the direction of the main ice flow or\nlongitudinal flow). In consequence, they had only demon-\nstrated the instability operated for transverse features, i.e.,\nribbed moraine. This was confirmed by Schoof [2007] who\nexplicitly demonstrated that transverse features, i.e., ridges\noriented transverse to flow grow faster than any other\nshape with a shorter-transverse dimension, for example,\nFigure 4. Conceptual illustration of the fact that growth of perturbations at closely related wavelengths\nproduces a net perturbation at a well-defined wavelength. (top) The heavy blue line represents a\ncomputed perturbation to an initially flat till surface. Note that the wavelength is around one. (bottom)\nThe growth rate as a function of wavelength. Waves at each of these wavelength are plotted in Figure 4\n(top) (multicolored lines) with amplitude given by exp(100 \u0003 growth rate), representing their evolution\nafter say 100 years. The heavy blue line in Figure 4 (top) represents the sum of all the multicolored\nwaves. The multicolored smaller waves (the \u2018\u2018Fourier components\u2019\u2019) are not physically observable, only\nthe heavy blue line is directly observable and represents the observed unstable form (i.e., the ribbed\nmoraine).\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n4 of 15\nF03005\ndrumlinoid features, and therefore become the dominant\nfeature. The conclusion from this is that as the instability\nstarts to operate, till waves form and these transverse\nfeatures will form at around the wavelength of maximum\ngrowth rate. In short, Hindmarsh [1998a, 1998b, 1998c]\nand Fowler [2000] were premature to regard the instability\nas a likely cause of drumlins and the mathematical analysis\nby Schoof [2007] demonstrates that the instability might be\nan explanation for ribbed moraine. However, the possibil-\nity remains that model extensions might produce a drumlin\nforming instability.\n4. Description of the BRIE\n[11] BRIE is a physically based ice and till flow model\nthat models the behavior of an ice mass coupled to a\ndeforming bed. The physical environment considered is a\nviscous layer of ice overlying a layer of viscous till which in\nturn overlies rigid bedrock. Deformation can occur both\nwithin the ice and the till, and sliding can also occur at the\nice\/bed and till\/bedrock interface (Figure 5). The bedrock\ncannot deform. It has been demonstrated that the coupled\nflow of ice and till is conditionally unstable if bumps exist\nin the till surface [Hindmarsh, 1998b, 1998c; Fowler,\n2000]. In principle, these bumps can be microscopic, in\npractice we are supposing that they are sufficiently small not\nto be recognizable as a precursor landform, and that they do\nnot contain a dominant wavelength. Here, wavelength refers\nto the horizontal scale of a disturbance in the till thickness.\nUnder certain conditions in BRIE, small undulations in till\nthickness can grow, causing relief to appear spontaneously.\nThis has been shown to occur over a range of wavelengths\n[Hindmarsh, 1998a]. As explained above, since the insta-\nbility grows exponentially with time, the growth at the\npreferred wavelength soon comes to dominate, and a wave\nforms with length scales characterized by this wavelength.\n[12] BRIE self consistently computes stress and velocity\nfields in ice and till, ensuring that mass is conserved and\nthat forces (momentum) balance \u2013 in other words, Newton\u2019s\nLaws are respected. For example, the till pushes back on the\nice with a force equal to that which the ice exerts on the till.\nBRIE uses these principles along with the viscous relation-\nships for till and for ice to predict the variation of velocities\nand stresses in relation to bump geometry within the ice and\nthe till. The velocities within the till determine whether till\nbumps grow or decay. Intuitively one can expect physical\nparameters such as the ice velocity to affect the rate of\ngrowth or decay of bumps. BRIE does not use approxima-\ntions like the shallow ice approximation [Hutter, 1983] or\nhigher-order models [e.g., Blatter, 1995]; it solves the full\nsystem of mechanical equations as did, for example, Nye\n[1969].\n[13] The equations (see later) are nonlinear and cumber-\nsome to solve. A significant gain in tractability is gained by\nassuming that deviations from uniformity in the till and the\nice are small compared to till thickness. This at least permits\nus to predict the wavelength at which landforms will form.\nConsequently, BRIE can only be used to predict the\nwavelength at which subglacial landforms are \u2018\u2018seeded,\u2019\u2019\ni.e., creating an obstacle that generates a feedback, which\nleads to further growth of the obstacle. Once the bumps\nbecome large the predictions of BRIE become inaccurate\nand the results can be no longer relied upon, although it is\nunlikely that the wavelength will change dramatically. In\nmore technical terms the nonlinear equations are linearized,\nand this procedure is no longer accurate when bumps\nbecome large. A linearized model deals with a restricted\nrange of bump amplitudes, over which the rate of growth or\ndecay of the height of the bump is linearly proportional to\nthe bump amplitude. For example, if the system is unstable\nthen a bump with twice the amplitude will grow twice as\nfast. With such a methodology, BRIE can predict the\ndominant wavelength of the amplified perturbations. How-\never, it is unable to predict the maximum size to which these\nbumps can grow. To summarize, this theory interprets\nribbed moraine as being a wave-like phenomenon caused\nby this ribbing instability and offers the first physically\nbased explanation of ribbed moraine genesis.\n5. BRIE Model: Parameters and Outputs\n[14] As mentioned previously, Hindmarsh [1998a, 1998b,\n1998c, 1999] argues for a viscous rheology of the till. In\nBRIE the relevant parameters are effective pressure at the\nsurface (pe0), shear stress (t0), ice velocity (U0) and till\nthickness (D0), rheological index b and the proportion of ice\nslip velocity due to till deformation (as opposed to slip of\nice over the till). Some of these parameters occur in the\nrheological relationship\n_e \u00bc A t\nb\npbe\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere _e is the strain rate, A is the viscous coefficient of till,\nt is the shear stress, pe is the effective pressure and b is the\nrheological index. The viscous coefficient A and the index b\nFigure 5. (a) Cartoon of BRIE ingredients. Ice and till can\ndeform internally and sliding can occur at the ice\/bed till\/\nbedrock interface.

The relationship is of the form\n_e \u00bc Btn; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere B is the viscous coefficient for ice and n is another\nindex. The coefficient B is strongly temperature dependent\n[Paterson, 1994], but since BRIE assumes that the bed is\nat the pressure melting point of ice, we can take a value of\nB appropriate to that of ice at this temperature. A value of\n4.4 \u0003 10\u000724 Pa\u00073 s\u00071 is used along with the usual\nglaciological choice of n = 3.\n[16] Including a nonlinear rheology is a new feature of the\nBRIE model and should be compared with the linear\nrheological relationship used by Hindmarsh [1998a,\n1998b, 1999], Fowler [2000], and Schoof [2007]. Use of\na nonlinear rheology (n = 3) adds greater realism to the\nstudies. In particular, the viscosity of ice is strongly affected\nby the shear stress, and this makes a significant difference to\nthe wavelength of maximum growth rate [Fowler, 2000].\nAn analytical solution is still obtainable as the procedure is\na linearization. Details will be presented in a future paper.\n[17] The viscous coefficient A for subglacial till is poorly\nunderstood. However, it has easily computed effects on the\nmean ice velocity, which is much better constrained. The ice\nvelocity is simply proportional to the parameter A; if this is\ndoubled the ice velocity also doubles, all else being equal.\nThus, rather than using the viscous coefficient as a param-\neter, the ice velocity U0 is used as a parameter and the\nviscous coefficient computed from the specified ice veloc-\nity, effective pressure, shear stress and the rheological index\nusing the rheological relationship (1) and appropriate for-\nmulae for computing the ice velocity from these parameters\n[e.g., Hindmarsh, 1998a, 1998b, 1998c, 1999].\n[18] The rheological index b is equally poorly under-\nstood. This index determines whether the till deforms\nviscously or plastically. If b is very large (>10) then the till\nis effectively plastic. If b is relatively small (b < 5), then the\ntill can be regarded as viscous.\n[19] Apart from the parameters entering the till rheolog-\nical relationship, other parameters which affect the charac-\nteristics of subglacial instabilities are the till thickness D0.\nAccount can also be taken of the fact that some of the ice\nmotion can be accommodated by slip at the ice-till interface\nand also at the till-bed interface. This is represented in the\nsystem by specifying the proportion of the ice-sliding\nvelocity taken up by sliding at the ice-bed interface, within\nthe till and at the ice-till interface. Further details are given\nby Hindmarsh [1999].\n[20] As mentioned previously, when the model is run,\nbumps, or instabilities, in the system begin to grow. The\ninstability grows fastest at the preferred wavelength or\nwavelength of maximum growth rate. The BRIE predicts\nthis dominant wavelength and displays the results in graph-\nical form (Figure 6). In this case, the model predicts a\nmaximum wavelength of around 600 m under the specified\nparameter settings.\n[21] This is gratifying because the data from Dunlop and\nClark [2006a] indicate that 90 % of ribbed moraine wave-\nlengths lie between 100 m and 1000 m, so the computed\nwavelength would appear to be very typical. However, this\nvalue was obtained for a particular parameter set with D0 =\n10 m, U0 = 100 m\/a, t = 50 kPa, pe = 50 kPa, b = 3, and\nwith all the ice velocity accommodated by internal defor-\nmation. These are just one set of a very wide range of\nplausible parameters. In order to be convinced that the\ntheory can explain ribbed moraine wavelengths, one needs\nto determine whether ribbed moraine ridges of the correct\nwavelength are produced by other plausible parameter\nvalues.\n6. Approaches to Model Testing\n[22] Our reading of the history of subglacial bedform\nresearch is that mechanistic case-specific hypotheses have\nbeen developed to explain observations from individual or\nsmall groups of landforms which may not be representative\nof the population. Curiously, the naming of bedforming\nphenomena into discrete and specific landforms (drumlins,\nribbed moraine) may have hindered progress as it focuses\nenquiry and explanation on the specific landform, rather\nthan the complete surface or field. Defining a drumlin, for\nexample, as a specific landform emphasizes it is a bump in a\nlandscape, and the beauty of its streamlined shape, rather\nthat the overall bumpy pattern of a drumlin field. While true\nunderstanding of bedforms will require complete explana-\ntion of all aspects, we argue that the paramount question and\nFigure 6. Graphical output of the BRIE showing the\ndominant wavelength of the instability (solid black line and\nleft axis). In this example a wavelength of 600 m is obtained\nwhen the till thickness, D0 = 10 m, effective pressure re0 =\n0.5 bar (50 kPa), shear stress, t0 is 0.5 bar (50 kPa), and the\nsliding velocity, U0 is 100 ma\n\u00071. (After Hindmarsh [1999].)\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n6 of 15\nF03005\nstarting point should be the holistic question of patterning;\nthat is, why does a presumably otherwise flat sheet of\nsediment become organized such that repetitive and well\norganized thickenings in this sediment yield a bumpy upper\nsurface that forms a pattern we are able to recognize and\nname? In this viewpoint we ask what processes change the\nsediment thickness such that the upper surface resembles\nbedforms. The explanation thus hinges on relief amplifica-\ntion from a flat surface (bump making) rather than specific\nforms of individual landforms (bump shaping). Which\nmechanisms cause bumps to grow, or did selective erosion\noccur to leave bumps behind? The primary characteristic of\na series of well organized and repetitive bumps are their\nwavelength and amplitude (i.e., organization in space), with\nshape and symmetry of each form a secondary concern.\nMuch of the bedform literature addresses and seeks expla-\nnation of the secondary characteristics (shapes; such as\ndrumlin streamlining or ribbed moraine ridge asymmetry)\nwhile the overall patterning characteristics are less well\nexplored. We note that Smalley and Warburton [1994] made\nan appeal to investigate drumlin fields rather than drumlins\nwith the rather elegant argument drawing analogy between\nbumps on golf balls and drumlin fields. Bumps on golf ball\nare designed with amplitude and wavelength such that they\ninduce numerous small vortices behind them and which\nprovide less drag through the air than a singular large\nvortex, and thus a bumpy golf ball travels further than a\nsmooth similarly sized ball. An interesting question is\nwhether ice sheets shape their beds to change its roughness\nfor reasons of flow efficiency.\n[23] We regard that a promising theory for the production\nof subglacial bedforms should first be capable of explaining\nthe geometry of patternings, followed by shaping and other\ncharacteristics. Of course any observation that contradicts\nthe theory is capable of falsification, but we propose starting\nwith the primary characteristics. We thus organize our\ntesting procedure around this notion, and in this paper\ndescribe how well BRIE performs in explaining ribbed\nmoraine wavelength.\n[24] An ideal test would involve controlled physical\nexperimentation (in a constructed ice and sediment\n\u2018\u2018flume\u2019\u2019) in which input parameters (e.g., ice velocity) are\nmanipulated and bedforms actually grown. The wave-\nlengths of resulting bedforms could be measured to assess\nthe accuracy of theory predictions. If the theory correctly\npredicts the wavelengths for a whole range of experiments\nwith widely varied values of controlling parameters, then\nwe could conclude it performs well and is probably correct.\nThis is a common approach taken for model testing with\nregard to aeolian and fluvial bedforms, especially those that\nare small and form quickly. Such an approach for testing\nsubglacial bedforms however is fraught with difficulty,\ngiven the spatial (102\u2013103 m) and temporal scales (0.1\u2013\n100s years) of the phenomena in question.\n[25] If we cannot manipulate controlled experiments of\nthis environment, another approach is to exploit fortuitous\nreal world situations. For example, for places in Antarctica,\nif we knew enough about the range of relevant parameters\n(ice velocity, sediment thickness, effective pressure etc.) and\ncould image the bed using geophysics sufficiently well to\nidentify ribbed moraine, we could use the model to predict\nin which areas ribbed moraine should be forming and at\nwhat wavelength. If for many different places and combi-\nnations of governing parameters, the model correctly pre-\ndicted the occurrence of ribbed moraine and their\nwavelength we would conclude it is a good model. Unfor-\ntunately data do not yet exist for such an approach.\n[26] Given that at present we cannot manipulate con-\ntrolled experiments or exploit real world cases where ribbed\nmoraine are actually forming (we know of no such place)\nwe have to develop tests which do not rely on a direct\nmatching of the controlling parameters with the resulting\nlandforms. The following questions provide first-order tests\nof increasing power, and as argued earlier we focus on the\nprimary characteristic of ribbed moraine wavelength: (1)\nCan the model produce a pattern resembling ribbed mo-\nraine? (2) Can the model predict ribbed moraine wave-\nlengths over the full range found in nature? (3) Does the\nmodel predict the most commonly found wavelengths? (4)\nDoes the predicted length of time for landform generation\nconform to expectations? (5) Are observed spatial trends in\nwavelength in nature correctly simulated by the model?\n7. Choice of Parameter Values\n[27] An important consideration of model testing centers\non the parameter ranges used during model runs. To be of\nany real value, parameter space needs to be adequately\nconstrained so that only sensible values are used. If the\nmodel produces sensible results under unrealistic parameter\nsettings it is of no use as a tool in understanding the\nsubglacial environment. Consequently, parameter ranges\nmust be constrained to ensure the values used approximate\nthose that occurred in nature during ribbed moraine forma-\ntion. If realistic parameter values are used and the model\npredicts the ribbed moraine characteristics accurately this\nwould bolster the validity of BRIE. Considering that there\nare many uncertainties regarding the beds of contemporary\nice sheets, estimating the exact basal conditions that oc-\ncurred beneath Pleistocene ice sheets is highly problematic.\nNonetheless, by using information from contemporary ice\nsheets and knowledge regarding ribbed moraine properties\nand their spatial distribution, we contend that parameter\nspace can be adequately constrained. The following sections\noutline the logic for choosing the parameter ranges used for\nthis study.\n7.1. Till Thickness\n[28] The most obvious place to get estimates of till\nthickness is to investigate the sediment of ribbed moraine\nfields. However, despite the numerous detailed studies\nconducted on ribbed moraines there have been few inves-\ntigations of sediment thickness. Lundqvist [1969, 1997]\ncommented that the till sheet between individual ridges is\ngenerally thin, and seismic investigations in the Lake Rogen\narea [Wattenson, 1983] have found that most of the surficial\nmaterial is contained within the ribbed moraine ridges and\nthat the till sheet is thin or lacking in between. These are\nimportant observations and help provide some diagnostic\nclues as to the original thickness of the till sheet before it\nwas deformed. If it is assumed that the situation is similar in\nthe other regions, i.e., that ribbed moraines contain most of\nthe sediment, then ribbed moraine ridges are approximately\ntwice as thick as the till sheet that they originated from. This\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n7 of 15\nF03005\nis actually a controversial assumption, because it assumes\nthat the instability theory is correct and that waves are being\nproduced. Dunlop and Clark [2006a] have reported that\nridge heights range from 1 m to 64 m in height. On the basis\nthat the original till thickness was half the ribbed moraine\nheight, the lower limit for the till thickness parameter is\ntaken as 0.5 m and the upper value 30 m.\n7.2. Shear Stress\n[29] BRIE requires that mean stress be a parameter. This\nshould not be confused with the local stress, which fluc-\ntuates around any subglacial obstacle. The mean stress can\nbe equated with the basal shear stress as commonly defined\nin glaciology. In simple terms, basal shear stress in glacial\nsystems is due to both the weight of the overlying ice and\nthe slope of the ice surface. For small bed slopes, the shear\nstress at a point can be calculated from the following\nequation:\nt \u00bc righ sina; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere t is the shear stress, r is the density of ice, g is\ngravitational acceleration, h is the ice thickness and a is the\nsurface slope of the ice. Regarding Pleistocene ice sheets, it\nis difficult to see how this formula can be of much use as a\nmethod for estimating basal shear stress, as all of the\ncomponents necessary for making the calculation are\neffectively unknown. Using contemporary ice sheets as an\nanalog is probably a better way of determining the range of\nshear stress that can occur in nature at the ice sheet scale as\nall the components of the equation can be measured.\n[30] By using equation (3), the basal shear stresses for\nmany valley glaciers have been calculated and estimates\nshow that values vary typically between 50 and 150 kPa\n[Paterson, 1994]. More recent investigations conducted on\nice streams resting on deformable sediment show that the\ndriving stresses can be much lower. For example, the\ndriving stress of Ice Stream B in the Siple Coast, Antarctica\nhas been estimated to be 20 kPa [Alley et al., 1989] and as\nlow as 10 kPa [Jackson and Kamb, 1997]. Moreover, the\nflanks of ice streams can support much of this stress, so that\nthe basal stress can be much lower than the driving stress in\nice streams [Whillans and Van der Veen, 1993]. Values as\nlow as 2 kPa (the cohesive strength of till) have been\nsuggested [Jackson and Kamb, 1997]. Inside the main body\nof the ice sheet shear stresses are much higher with the\nmaximum shear stress being estimated to be 100 kPa\n[Paterson, 1994]. To test the BRIE model, the range of\nshear stress values is chosen to encompass the range found\nin ice sheets; 2 kPa to 100 kPa.\n7.3. Effective Pressure\n[31] The effective pressure enters BRIE through the\nrheological relationship (equation 1). The effective pressure\nis a measure of the normal stress that is exerted on the till by\nthe overlying ice sheet. Since BRIE assumes that the\npressures within the till are lithostatic and hydrostatic, only\nthe effective pressure at the interface between the ice and\nthe till needs to be specified. This effective pressure is\ndefined by subtracting the pore water pressure from the ice\noverburden pressure. Since rising pore water pressures\nreduce the overall shear strength of the till, consequently\nhigh values of effective pressure would indicate that the till\nhas a high yield strength, can withstand high shear stresses\nand is less likely to deform. Low values would signify the\nopposite, with yield stresses significantly less than that of\nthe overlying ice [Paterson, 1994]. Since BRIE presupposes\nthat the till is deforming, there is an implied upper limit to\neffective pressures, as we need not consider those that\nincrease the strength of the sediment to the point where\nthe till can no longer deform. As a rough approximation to\nthe upper value of effective pressure, we can use Coulomb\u2019s\nLaw (equation 2.2) to state that t = hpe, where h is the\ncoefficient of friction. A typical value for h is 0.5, but it can\nbe as low as 0.25, taking this with the maximum value of\nthe shear stress discussed above (100 kPa) then the largest\neffective pressure that permits deformation is given by pe =\nt\/h. This gives a maximum effective pressure of 400 kPa.\nEven though an argument based on plasticity is being used\nhere, this is consistent with the view of Hindmarsh [1997]\nwho argues that viscous deformation is the aggregate of\nmany plastic events. Plastic failure must occur for defor-\nmation to occur. Evidence for ponds beneath Ice Stream C\nimplies that the effective pressure can be as low as zero.\nBRIE assumes that effective pressures are greater than zero,\nso somewhat arbitrarily the lowest effective pressure is\ntaken as 2 kPa. Thus, a realistic range of effective pressures\nfor a deforming system will range somewhere between 2\nand 400 kPa, and these values are used to test the model.\n[32] This effective pressure is the value at the ice till\ninterface. Under the assumptions of the model, the effective\npressure increases with depth as the weight of the sediment\npresses the grains harder together. The increase of effective\npressure with depth is taken as 10 Pa m\u00071. This value is\njustified by Hindmarsh [1998a]. It can be seen from\nequation (2) that the strain rate will depend on the depth\nof the point being considered beneath the ice-till interface.\nThe shear stress can be considered to be constant over the\ndepth of the till [Hindmarsh, 1998a; Fowler, 2000]. The\nadditional velocity component of the ice, as a consequence\nof till deformation is given by summing (integrating) the\nstrain rates over the depth of the till.\n7.4. Ice Velocities\n[33] Ice sheet velocities are known to vary significantly\ndepending on the position that is being measured. Generally\nspeaking, the slowest moving ice will be found in the\ninterior with velocities at the ice divide being close to zero.\nThe fastest velocities are found in ice streams which are\nknown to vary considerably from around 100 m\/a\u00071 (where\na is years) for Ice stream B to 12,600 m a\u00071 for Jakobshavn\nIsbrae [Joughin et al., 2004]. Although ribbed moraines\nhave been identified within palaeo-ice stream tracks\n[Dyke et al., 1992; Stokes and Clark, 2001; Dunlop,\n2004; Stokes et al., 2006; Dunlop and Clark, 2006a]\ninterpretations of their position within the onset zone and\nsuperimposition on top of the ice stream bedforms means\nthey are more likely to be associated with the slower ice\nvelocities experienced in onset zones and during ice stream\nshut down [Dunlop, 2004; Stokes et al., 2006]. Since ice\nvelocities involved in ribbed moraine formation will be\nless than those found typically in fully functioning ice\nstreams, ice velocities will be restricted to those typical of\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n8 of 15\nF03005\nice sheet flow. For simplicity, we chose the lower and\nupper values to be 0.5 and 100 m\/a\u00071.\n7.5. Rheological Index\n[34] As stated previously, the rheological index b param-\neter is unknown and has been set to either low numbers, i.e.,\n1\u20133 (i.e., a viscous rheology) or to high numbers e.g., 10 or\nmore (i.e., a plastic rheology). We consider the range as\nbeing 1\u201310 to encompass both viscous and plastic rheolo-\ngies. It turns out that the results are not sensitive to this\nparameter, which fortunately decouples the rheological and\ngeomorphological issues. Table 1 lists the parameter values\nused for model runs.\n8. Results\n[35] We now proceed to ask whether the BRIE always,\nsometimes, rarely or never predicts the formation of ribbed\nmoraine using our justified parameter ranges. Clearly, if it\nnever predicts the formation of ribbed moraine then the\nmodel is wrong; however, the other possibilities are more\ncomplicated. For example, BRIE may not only predict the\nrange of wavelengths observed, but may also predict ribbed\nmoraines to occur at many other wavelengths not found in\nnature. Does this mean that the BRIE is wrong, or that the\nchosen range of parameters is wrong? We have gone to\nsome lengths to give motivation and justification for likely\nranges of these parameters, but in our present state of\nknowledge, it is not possible to constrain them any further.\nHowever, we cannot assert that this particular range of\nparameters is appropriate when ribbed moraines are form-\ning. In general, we would expect a much more restricted\nrange of parameters to have existed during the lifetime of\nformation of a particular ribbed moraine than the full range\nused for each parameter.\n[36] We can estimate growth timescales for ribbed mor-\naines which are given by the ratio of wavelength to velocity.\nWith wavelengths of a few hundred meters, and ice veloc-\nities greater than 1 m a year, this implies ribbed moraine can\nbuild up in decades or centuries. We use this estimate to\nassert that during the time taken to create a ribbed moraine\nfield that ice velocities did not vary greatly. In the same\nway, one might expect that during the period of formation of\na ribbed moraine field, the mean shear stress needs to be\nconstant, because the ice thickness and surface slope would\nnot change much during this period. It is harder to argue that\nthe effective pressure was constant in view of the large\nfluctuations in water pressure observed in alpine glaciers\n[Paterson, 1994]. However, this is largely a consequence of\nconnection to the outside world (e.g., through crevasses and\nmoulins) and for features formed some distance back from\nthe margin, and thus under thicker ice, effective pressure\nchanges are likely to be inhibited or significantly muted\nbecause the pathways for surface meltwater are either closed\nor would be long. These factors require us to be careful in\nthe conclusions we draw from the comparison of predicted\nand observed wavelengths.\n[37] Figure 7 shows histograms of predicted and observed\nribbed moraine wavelengths. The observed results are those\nreported by Dunlop and Clark [2006a], binned logarithmi-\ncally. The predictions come from populations of computed\nwavelengths of maximum growth rate, one histogram for\nthe parameter ranges described earlier, the other for a\nreduced parameter set which was chosen to make the mean\npredicted and observed values approximately the same \u2013 in\nother words a first attempt to invert for the controlling\nparameters from the data.\n8.1. Can the Model Produce a Pattern Resembling\nRibbed Moraine?\n[38] This question relates to the primary characteristics of\na pattern (e.g., wavelength), rather than the intricate geo-\nmorphological details of ribbed moraines such as topo-\ngraphic ridge asymmetry or downstream pointing horns.\nThe ridges that make up a ribbed moraine field resemble\nsimple waveforms (i.e., repetitive ridge spacings). Such a\nthree-dimensional pattern comprising waves must have a\ndominant downstream wavelength and any lateral wave-\nlength must be much greater than this (otherwise the pattern\nwould not consist of waves). While BRIE does not currently\nproduce map plane outputs (i.e., a three-dimensional sur-\nface), it does predict the downstream wavelengths that\nshould arise (see later and Figure 7), and we use the results\nof Schoof [2007] to assert that this is a ribbing instability, in\nthat the lateral (across flow) wavelength is shown to be very\nlarge. BRIE predicts a patterning of sediment thickness (i.e.,\nrelief amplification to produce landforms) and that this\npattern is composed of waveforms (rather than pimples,\nfor example). We thus conclude that at the most basic level,\nthe model produces the right type of pattern. Although a\nfairly primitive test, we note that competing theories of\nribbed moraine genesis [e.g., Bouchard, 1989; Fisher and\nShaw, 1992; Ha\u00a8ttestrand, 1997; Mo\u00a8ller, 2006; Sarala,\n2006] have yet to undergo this test based on a physically\nformulated model.\n8.2. Can the Model Predict Ribbed Moraine\nWavelengths Over the Full Range Found in Nature?\n[39] Clearly the model would be wrong, or at least\nincomplete, if it cannot explain the full scale range of ribbed\nmoraine wavelengths. Ribbed moraines are known to exist\nat a variety of scales, with the smallest, called \u2018\u2018minor\nribbed moraine,\u2019\u2019 found in Sweden [Ha\u00a8ttestrand, 1997]\nTable 1.

Dunlop and Clark [2006a]\nreport a systematic analysis of ribbed moraine wavelengths\nperformed by both manual techniques and spectral (Fourier)\nanalysis on downstream-aligned transects totaling 13,500 km\nin length, across ribbed moraine fields in Canada, Ireland\nand Sweden, and encompassing all major ribbed moraine\ntypes including minor and megascale. They report a range\nof wavelengths from 12 to 5800 m. Of the 2116800\nmodel runs thus far produced exploring the full governing\nparameter space, the predicted wavelengths range between\n12 and 8000. This exceeds the range found in nature, and we\nthus fail to falsify the model. In fact it appears a major\nachievement to produce a single process formulation that\nencompasses the whole range of wavelengths measured from\nminor through to megascale ribbed moraines.\n8.3. Does the Model Predict the Most Commonly\nFound Wavelengths?\n[40] The observed frequency distribution of ribbed mo-\nraine wavelengths (Figure 7) demonstrates that they are\ndistributed approximately lognormally. The unimodality\nsuggests that it is appropriate to search for a single process\ntheory to explain the whole range of observed ribbed\nmoraine, rather than a collection of different theories to,\nsay, explain minor ribbed moraine and megascale ribbed\nmoraine. If different formative theories were required, one\nmight expect a multimodal wavelength distribution. The\nmost common wavelengths occur around 400 m with\naround 90% of all ribbed moraine wavelengths found\nbetween the ranges of 100\u2013800 m.\n[41] A good test of the BRIE would be to see whether it\npredicts ribbed moraine at the most common wavelengths\nfound in nature; clearly a good theory should be able to\nreproduce the wavelength frequency distribution, and ex-\nplain why wavelengths around 400 m are the most common.\nIf one compares the predicted and observed wavelength\ndistributions (Figure 7), a broad similarity in shape is\napparent. However, for the model runs using the full\nparameter range, the modal wavelength is around 100 m,\nwhich is less than the observed value of 400 m. What does\nthis mismatch mean; an incorrect model or incorrect choice\nof parameters?\n[42] We show that we can tune the parameter ranges to\nget a modal value close to the observed value, by restricting\nthe range of mean shear stresses (Figure 7), but such an\napproach logically invalidates the comparison as a strict\n\u2018\u2018test.\u2019\u2019 It merely shows that the model can produce the\nappropriate modal wavelengths if we resort to tuning. In\ngeneral, we caution that comparison of the modal peak\npositions and distributions should not be taken as a robust or\npowerful test, because they do not actually compare like\nwith like. This is because we do not have enough informa-\ntion on which particular parameter settings most commonly\nproduced ribbed moraines. For example, when glacial\nprocesses produced ribbed moraines at the wavelengths\nwe now observe, the governing parameters had a partic-\nular (but unknown to us) probability distribution. Maybe,\nfor example, the landforms preferred to generate under\nFigure 7. Comparison between the (bottom) measured\nwavelength and (top and middle) predicted wavelengths.\nComparison is through histograms of measured wavelength\n(Figure 7 (bottom)) or occurrence of predicted wavelength.\nPredicted populations are generated through computing\nwavelength as a function of a large number of parameter\ncombinations. Figure 7 (top) is the full parameter set, and\nFigure 7 (middle) is a reduced parameter set. Full parameter\nset compiled from 2,116,800 parameter combinations,\nreduced parameter set complied from 529,200 parameter\ncombinations, and observations based on ribbed moraine\nwavelength measurements obtained from transects totaling\n12,000 km in length.\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n10 of 15\nF03005\nvelocities of 30 ma\u00071 and an ice thickness of 400 m, rather\nthan equally across the whole velocity and ice thickness\nrange. We of course have no means of knowing the\nparametric probability distribution that operated in the past.\nThus for pragmatic reasons we did not use a probability\ndensity function, but simply let velocity vary in equal\nincrements across the range from 1 to 100 ma\u00071, whereas\nwe recognize that in nature it may have varied across this\nrange but with a mode of say 10 ma\u00071.\n[43] An obvious approach around this problem would be\nto estimate the probability density function for all the\ngoverning parameters (velocity, till thickness, shear stress,\neffective pressure, rheological exponent and deformational\nvelocity proportion), but too little information exists to\nguide a sensible choice, thus making such an approach\nrather meaningless. We could of course have tuned the\nparameter ranges such that the predicted wavelength distri-\nbution matches the observed. However, this would not have\nbeen a test of the model, but rather would presume the\nmodel is correct and be an exploration of the parameter\nranges required to produce ribbed moraine. This is an\ninteresting goal for the future, but premature at this stage,\nsince we are currently interested in learning whether the\nmodel reasonably works. We should also note that our\nexploration of parameter space included all permutations,\nmany of which might be glaciologically unfeasible, and that\nthis might help explain why the predicted wavelength\ndistribution is larger than the observed.\n8.4. Does the Predicted Length of Time for Landform\nGeneration Conform to Expectations?\n[44] This is an important question but we do not have a\nvery strong empirical basis for such expectations. Clearly\nif the model predicted growth of a ribbed moraine in a\nmatter of seconds, or longer than the lifespan of the ice\nsheet then the model is wrong. Unfortunately, there is scant\nguidance from the geomorphological literature as to likely\ntimescales. Rose [1989] suggested subglacial bedforms can\nbe created within a period of between 4 and 400 years\nirrespective of their size. The first observation of bed\nforming occurring under a contemporary ice mass (Rutford\nIce Stream, Antarctica) suggests that an elongated bump,\ninterpreted as a drumlin, grew to a height of 10 m in 7 years\nunder an ice flow velocity of around 400 ma\u00071 [Smith et al.,\n2007]. However, this velocity is faster than we expect for\nribbed moraine generation, which is not associated with\nstreaming ice [Dunlop, 2004]. Thus it seems reasonable to\nexpect ribbed moraine generation to occur under slower ice\nsheet velocities (<100 ma\u00071) and to take longer periods to\nform. Since the time frame for development remains essen-\ntially unknown, a tentative timescale for development might\nlie in the range of 10 to 1000 years.\n[45] The question has relevance to predicted sedimentary\nstructures found within ribbed moraine, and in particular\nwhether we expect them to be completely composed of till,\nor of till overlying a core of undisturbed preexistent\nmaterial. If a ribbed moraine ridge can travel several wave-\nlengths while its relief is increasing, we expect the maxi-\nmum elevation of the undisturbed parent material to be\napproximately uniform, corresponding to the depth of the\nbase of the deformation beneath the intercostal trough. If\nhowever, the relief builds up in a time where the ridge\ntravels a distance short compared with the wavelength, then\nwe expect that the preexisting material will have been\nexcavated from beneath the trough only, and for the upper\nsurface of undisturbed material to be higher underneath the\npeaks of the ribbed moraine. While the ribbed moraine has\nsmall amplitude compared with the depth of deformation,\nthese effects will be apparent, even though the relief is\nslowly increasing. It is only then the ribbed moraine\namplitude is comparable with the depth of deformation that\nwe expect it to produce observable effects such as we\ndescribe above in the geometry of the undisturbed material.\nSince in the linearized theory the relief grows exponentially,\ni.e., at a rate proportional to its size, in order to compute the\ndistance traveled while the ribbed moraine is growing, we\nneed to define a starting size. This could be based on the\ndepth of deformation as argued above, but to facilitate\ncomparison we choose a typical depth of deformation\n(100 mm) and use this as the starting size. Anything smaller\nand we would not expect to be able to observe the\nconsequences in the internal stratigraphy, while anything\nlarger is no longer a conservative assumption.\n[46] Using BRIE we take a 100 mm bump and work out\nhow long it takes to grow into a typically sized ribbed\nmoraine (of 20 m relief). A typical model run provides a\ngrowth rate of 0.5 per year (i.e., a factor of (e)0.5 per year),\nwhich equates a relief amplification of 1.65 of its size each\nyear. For this case it grows into a 20 m bump in approx-\niamtely 6 years. This appears a reasonable timescale. For\nthe range of growth rates that BRIE derives, the fastest a\n20 m bump could grow ranges from less than a year to nearly\n10000 years, which are the extreme limits, and may not be\nrealistic.\n[47] Given that our theory requires that as a bump grows\nit also migrates downstream at some fraction of the ice\nvelocity, then an important consideration is whether the\nribbed moraine has sufficient time to grow before it emerges\nat the ice sheet margin. Given that ribbed moraine are\ngenerated at large distances from ice margins and grow in\ntimes shorter than the residence of time of ice sheets it is\nclear that bumps can grow quickly enough before being\nmigrated out the system. For the full range of parameter\nspace explored we report the range of times it takes to grow\na 20 m high ribbed moraine and the distance they migrated\ndownstream during their growth (Figure 8). It seems that\nmost ribbed moraines take around 100 years to grow and\nmigrate 1 km downstream, approximately two wavelengths.\nOur caveats, mentioned earlier, with regard to not knowing\nthe true probability density function of the parameters also\napplies to these estimates.\n8.5. Is There any Physical or Empirical Support for the\nModeled Sensitivities of Wavelength Prediction to the\nGoverning Parameters?\n[48] Figure 9 illustrates the sensitivity of predicted wave-\nlength to the five governing parameters. For each value of a\nparameter, a wavelength frequency distribution is computed,\nand bins are plotted as a function of the parameter and\nwavelength. Variation in the modal wavelength with the\nparameter values indicates sensitivity.\n[49] For ice with a linear rheology, Fowler [2000] pre-\ndicts that the wavelength of maximum growth rate varies\nwith the square root of ice viscosity, till rate factor A, and\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n11 of 15\nF03005\nthe effective pressure. In our model we do not prescribe the\ntill rate factor, but implicitly define it through our choices of\nvelocity, shear stress and effective pressure. However, all\nelse being equal, the till rate factor is proportional to the\nvelocity, so we expect the wavelength to be proportional to\nthe square root of the velocity for a linear ice rheology, and\nthis evidently also holds for a nonlinear ice rheology\n(Figure 9). Since basal shear stress affects ice viscosity\nthrough the Glen relationship, we expect there to be a direct\ndependence on shear stress, which is also clearly demon-\nstrated (Figure 9). There are also clear dependencies on\neffective pressure and till thickness. There is no strong\ndependence on the rheological index b.\n[50] Circumstantial observations indicate that ribbed\nmoraine wavelength appears to vary with till thickness\n[Ha\u00a8ttestrand, 1997] and when a field crosses from one\nbedrock lithology to another where permeability is different\n[Clark and Meehan, 2001]. Such changes could provide\nuseful checks on model functioning. This approach has yet\nto be tackled properly, because the observations have not\nbeen systematically compiled, but we report two circum-\nstances where model predictions and data can be reasonably\ncompared. In county Monaghan Ireland, the field of mega-\nscale ribbed moraine reported by Clark and Meehan [2001]\nexhibit an increase in wavelength across the boundary from\nwell-drained Carboniferous limestone just northwest of\nMonaghan town to less permeable Ordovician shale, sand-\nstone, basalt and rhyolite that dominate the landscape to the\nsoutheast. If a substantial proportion of ice sheet drainage is\nbeing carried in the aquifer we can infer that effective\npressure decreased across this boundary. According to model\npredictions (Figure 9) as effective pressure decreases then\nwavelength should increase. This direction of change is\nconsistent with the observations. However, we consider\nthis a weak test because as effective pressure changes then\nthis would most likely have influenced other parameters\nsuch as ice velocity and shear stress and we have not yet\naccounted for these.\n[51] In a discussion of minor ribbed moraine, Ha\u00a8ttestrand\n[1997] comments that the short-wavelength features are\nmostly found on high ground where the till cover is\nevidently much thinner in comparison with the longer-\nwavelength features found on valley floors where the till\nis thick. BRIE indicates (Figure 9) that as till thickness\ndecreases then wavelength should also decrease, and again\nthis is consistent with the limited observations available.\nFuture compilations of ribbed moraine wavelength and\nspatial variation coincident with changes in bedrock perme-\nability, till thickness etc should permit more rigorous model\ntesting especially when BRIE is coupled to an ice sheet\nmodel so we can model concomitant changes in all govern-\ning parameters.\n9. Conclusions\n[52] A physically based model for ribbed moraine forma-\ntion (BRIE) based on a naturally arising instability in the\ncoupled flow of ice and subglacial sediment, has been\nexplained and its predictions tested against a large database\ndescribing the spatial properties of these landforms. We\nconclude that this specific instability mechanism and its\nmodel formulation in BRIE correctly produce the patterning\nof ribbed moraines; that of a dominant downstream wave-\nlength and unbounded lateral wavelength yielding trans-\nverse waves (i.e., ridges) with a preferred wavelength.\n[53] We have compared the wavelength predictions of the\nmodel with observed wavelengths of ribbed moraine fields\nFigure 8. Histograms of populations of predicted (top)\ngrowth time, (middle) distance traveled measured in km\nduring this growth time, and (bottom) distance traveled\nmeasured in wavelengths. Growth phase is defined as\nperiod from when the relief is 100 mm (a typical depth of\ndeformation) to 20 m (a typical ribbed moraine amplitude).\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n12 of 15\nF03005\n[Dunlop and Clark, 2006a] but care is required in drawing\nconclusions from this exercise because the physical con-\nditions (parameter values) of ribbed moraine formation are\nnot well known. An attempt to circumvent this problem was\nmade by defining glaciologically plausible ranges for the\nphysical parameters which determine the wavelength of\nmaximum growth rate in the BRIE model, and assuming\nthat all the observed ribbed moraines were formed under\nthis range of conditions. The model predicts ribbed moraine\nformation at order of magnitude wavelengths between 100\nand 1000 m which we interpret as a major accomplishment\nof the model. Our bed ribbing instability may have produced\ncompletely unrealistic wavelengths such as 10\u20131000 km,\nfrom which we would have concluded with falsification.\nUnsurprisingly however, given the large range of the input\nparameters, the model predictions produced a range of\nwavelengths somewhat broader than those observed in\nnature. This is likely to be a consequence of the range of\ninput parameters being broader than those under which\nribbed moraine actually form. Thus, one cannot say that\nBRIE has been falsified on account of its slight over-\npredictions of ribbed moraine formation at short and long\nwavelengths.\n[54] Model computations of the rate of growth of small\nbumps into landforms of ribbed moraine amplitude indi-\ncates a plausible time (mode of 100 years) for their\nformation, when compared with the limited expectations\nand observations regarding real subglacial bedform growth.\nGiven that the theory requires bumps to migrate down-\nstream as they grow, an important consideration was to\nFigure 9.

Colors are scaled by maximum frequency in each\nvariable case. These examples are for the reduced parameter set.

Color coding shown at bottom right.\nF03005 DUNLOP ET AL.: BED RIBBING INSTABILITY EXPLANATION\n13 of 15\nF03005\ncheck that they could grow to sufficient relief prior to being\nmigrated out of the subglacial environment. This condition\nis easily satisfied and with typical migration distances of 1\nto 100 m and a maximum of 10 km.\n[55] The model predicts different wavelengths for differ-\nent conditions of till thickness and bed drainage (via\neffective pressure). Variations of wavelength of real ribbed\nmoraine with varying till thickness (in Sweden) and bed\ndrainage (in Ireland) are reported, and we note that the\nmodel predictions are at least in principle consistent with\nthis variation, in that they vary in the right direction.\n[56] Although the heritage of the BRIE approach comes\nfrom a school of thought that regards the rheology of\nsubglacial sediment to approximate that of a viscous fluid,\nwe found that the model was not sensitive to the rheological\nexponent and that instabilities are equally well predicted\nunder a viscous through to plastic medium. This is a\nsignificant conclusion, although it means that landscape\nformation may well be unilluminating about some aspects\nof the ice stream basal boundary.\n[57] This paper has considered geomorphic features that\nemerge spontaneously from a uniform till cover. Nearly\nalways, landforms are inherited. However, the instability\nmechanism discussed here is expected to operate on a\nnonuniform till cover, and will eventually shape it into a\nform where the original structure is no longer apparent.\nWhile this is happening, we believe the new landforms will\nbe a palimpsest on the old forms. Modeling is currently\nbeing undertaken to confirm this conjecture.\n[58] In summary, our tests failed to falsify the model, and\nthe BRIE theory remains a viable candidate for explaining\nribbed moraine formation. The problems faced in this paper\nregarding the verification of BRIE stem from our ignorance\nof the physical conditions under which ribbed moraine\nform. The successes of the BRIE theory are that it predicts\nthe occurrence of ribbed moraine pattern, and quantitatively\npredicts ribbed moraine of appropriate wavelengths. It\nremains to be seen whether quantitative formulations of\nthe other theories can achieve the same success.\n[59] Acknowledgments.
