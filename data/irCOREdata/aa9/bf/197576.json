Whether labour were predominantly enslaved, \napprenticed or indentured, incarceration was part of a broader process through which \nthe regulation of the colonial workforce was taken from the private to the public \nsphere and became associated with economic development.

Mauritian jails were intensely political arenas in which the changing nature of \ncolonial relations and the regulation of labour was both expressed and contested. \n \nKeywords: Mauritius, prisons, punishment, slavery, indenture, penal transportation \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe island of Mauritius lies in the southwest Indian Ocean, 800 km east of \nMadagascar. It remained uninhabited until the late sixteenth century when the Dutch \nestablished the first of two settlements and named it after Prince Maurice of Nassau. \nThey were plagued with difficulties and abandoned the settlement in 1710. Five years \nlater the French claimed the island, renaming it \u00cele de France, and the first settlers \narrived in 1721. The British took the island \u2013 which they called Mauritius \u2013 during the \n 2 \nNapoleonic Wars. Although the slave trade had been abolished in 1807, at the time \nthe institution of slavery remained central to the island\u2019s expanding plantation \neconomy. In 1835 slavery was abolished, but the 70,000 liberated slaves remained \ntied to their ex-owners through the institution of apprenticeship. Final emancipation \ncame in 1839. Disconcerted at the prospect of employing former chattels as free \nlabour, and faced with an unprecedented labour crisis, Mauritian planters replaced \nlocal workers with almost half a million labourers from India under contracts of \nindenture, radically altering the ethnic demography of Mauritius in the process. By \n1861, Indians comprised 62 per cent of the island\u2019s population.2\nThe history of penal confinement in British colonial Mauritius is inextricably \nlinked to this shift in the island\u2019s political economy, in particular the changing power \nrelations between local and metropolitan governments and the slave owning and \nplanting classes, in the context of a socially complex and changing population and a \nmassive expansion in the sugar industry.\n \n3\n  \n Whether labour were predominantly \nenslaved, apprenticed or indentured, incarceration was part of a broader process \nthrough which the regulation of the colonial workforce was taken from the private to \nthe public sphere. Moreover, in combining the removal of offenders from society with \nthe penal display associated with sentences of hard labour, and in using prisoners to \nconstruct and repair public works and road networks, penal space was also associated \nstrongly with colonial development. That is not to suggest that prisoners were passive \nagents in these penal processes, for they both challenged and used prison regimes as \nvehicles for the amelioration of their working and living conditions. Mauritian jails \ntherefore became intensely political arenas in which the changing nature of colonial \nrelations and the regulation of labour was both expressed and contested. \n 3 \nTHE BAGNE \n \nDuring the first years of French settlement, the punishment of the enslaved, whether \nlocal, African or Indian born, was largely a private affair. The Code Noir \u2013 a set of \nlegislation that aimed to bring slavery into the public arena and make slaves subject to \ncriminal law \u2013 came into force in 1723, but had little effect with regard to the private \npunishment of minor infractions.4 It was not until the second half of the eighteenth \ncentury that there were changes in this respect. In 1766, shortly before control of the \nisland passed from the French East India Company to the French government, the \nConseil Sup\u00e9rieur of \u00cele de France created a Bagne at Trou Fanfaron in the harbour \narea of the island\u2019s capital Port Louis where slaves served sentences of imprisonment \nand hard labour. Gendered forms of penal display were central to the Bagne regime. \nMen worked at outdoor road labour, in chains and iron collars weighing up to \nfourteen pounds, whilst women broke stones indoors.5 As in later colonial regimes, \nthis was a deliberate attempt to shield from public view female penal labour.6 The \nBagne also held slave deserters (maroons) who if they were unclaimed by their \nowners became state property. Colonists feared marronage greatly, and its potential \nsocial and economic consequences loomed large. Their general alarm drove the \ncreation of armed d\u00e9tachements to hunt fugitives down and the infliction of corporal \npunishments like branding, flogging, mutilation or even death.7 The Bagne had a third \nfunction as a place where the enslaved could go and lodge complaints against their \nowners, though the odds were stacked against them and the vast majority of claims \nwere declared unfounded.8\nAfter the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, during the British period the \nBagne was also used for the imprisonment of \u2018Liberated Africans\u2019 \u2013 also known as \n \n 4 \n\u2018Prize Negroes\u2019 \u2013 who although freed as illegally traded slaves were forcibly \napprenticed to employers for periods of up to fourteen years.9 Further legacies of the \nFrench administration were another small jail in Port Louis which was situated near \nthe police office and government house. This Police Prison \u2013 sometimes called the \nPrison du Violon \u2013 housed those slaves sentenced to simple imprisonment. There \nwere further civil and criminal prisons attached to the Supreme Court (Palais de \nJustice).10\nThe main purpose of the Bagne was the public regulation and discipline of the \ninstitution of slavery. However, exercising colonial administrators was the creation of \na space of less eligibility that would not be an attractive alternative to plantation, \ndomestic or other types of slave labour. Changes to the penal regime during the \nBritish period were spurred by slave owners\u2019 concerns that, despite the brutality of \nfetters, neck collars and hard labour, the enslaved actively sought imprisonment in the \nBagne where they would be better fed than by their masters and mistresses.\n There was no system of penal segregation at this time, though women and \ndebtors were kept separate from other prisoners.  \n11 The \ntransfer of punishment into the public arena was certainly unpopular with slave \nowners, for it removed their autonomy with respect to domestic or plantation \ndiscipline. Indeed, in 1827 the government set up an enquiry after complaints by slave \nowners about their \u2018daily losses\u2019 to the prison. Figures produced in the ensuing report \nshow that 2,764 slaves - about four per cent of the total slave population - entered the \nBagne in 1826, about a quarter of whom were women.12\nIn the first decades of the nineteenth century the Mauritian population grew \nrapidly, from 77,768 in 1807 to 92,997 in 1827.\n Their unease was reflected in \nthe fact that, despite the existence of the Bagne, even into the 1830s the punishment \nof slaves for \u2018petty offences\u2019 remained largely in the hands of their owners. \n13 The prison population increased \n 5 \nconcurrently. In 1819 William Burke, the Chief Medical Officer, wrote that the jails \nin Port Louis were in such an appalling condition that it would be more humane to \nsentence prisoners to death.14 The question of prison discipline in the colonies \ngenerally first exercised the metropolitan government after its 1830s enquiry into \nBritish prisons and houses of correction, when it issued a colonial circular calling for \ndetails of overseas prisons.15 By the time the circular arrived in Mauritius, the \ngovernment had in fact already passed legislation on imprisonment, Ordinance V of \n1835. It called for the construction of a new jail in Port Louis, proposed a series of \ninnovations relating to prison discipline including a five-tier system of classification, \nand created a supervisory prison committee.16 As a result, in 1839 a new House of \nCorrection based on cellular principles opened in the capital for the reception of \nlocally convicted prisoners and long-term offenders from the districts. By 1839 the \nfinal emancipation of some 53,000 ex-slave apprentices together with the arrival of \nover 25,000 indentured labourers from the Indian subcontinent threatened to \noverwhelm the available accommodation. With the jail unable to cope with the \nconviction of even a tiny proportion of the increased population, further additions \nwere made to create a total of 172 cells.17\n \n At the same time, work began on local \nprisons to serve each of the island\u2019s other eight districts, the largest at the old Powder \nMills complex in northern Pamplemousses. In 1858, Ordinance XXXI established \ndistrict prison committees to oversee them. \n\u2018DORMITORIES FOR THE SURVEYOR-GENERAL\u2019: IMPRISONMENT \nAND HARD LABOUR \n \n 6 \nSentences of imprisonment and hard labour were common during the French colonial \nperiod, with the threat of the chain gang part of the colonial penal armoury against \nslave marronage and other socially destabilising offences. Indeed, the colonial \npreoccupation with tracking down and putting to work unproductive slaves (and later \non apprentices and indentured labourers) might be seen as part of broader practices \nconcerning the need to control and discipline supposedly \u2018indolent natives\u2019, or at the \nvery least \u2018obstinate idlers\u2019. The association between imprisonment and hard labour \ncontinued with Britain\u2019s assumption of control of Mauritius, and with the opening of \nthe House of Correction in 1839 labour remained central to both penal intent and \ndisplay. Most prisoners were employed on public works, including the construction \nand repair of roads and bridges, military works such as the building of Fort Adelaide \n(or Citadel) just outside Port Louis and the quarantine station at Flat Island off the \nnorthern coast. Locally-convicted prisoners \u2013 slaves, apprentices, free creoles (born in \nMauritius of mixed descent) and Indian indentured labourers \u2013 worked alongside \nsoldiers, government slaves, liberated Africans, free workers, and convicts transported \nto the island from India (about whom more in a moment). In what had always been an \nintensely cosmopolitan and creolized society, there were no attempts to segregate free \nworkers, slaves and Indian convicts from prisoners or, except for the preclusion of \nwhite prisoners from hard labour, to otherwise racialize the workforce.18 Neither were \ndistinctions made between prisoners in this respect. By the third quarter of the \neighteenth century, the social complexities of this relatively small island were huge \u2013\nwhat one jailer in the southern prison at Grand Port described as an impossible mix of \nnationalities and classes.19 Unlike in India, however, few concessions were made to \nprisoners on religious, caste or status grounds.20 The refusal of high-caste Brahmin \nprisoner Marouden\u2019s request for a transfer from Port Louis on the basis that he was \n 7 \nunable to eat the rations provided is one of many such examples.21 Neither were \nHindu prisoners granted concessions with regard to the caste of the cooks preparing \ntheir rations, although they were not forced to eat beef or tripe.22 Moreover, and in \nstark contrast to the barely contained paranoia that characterized the running of Indian \nprisons in the years following the mutiny-rebellion of 1857-8, Christian priests moved \nabout Port Louis jail with a remarkable degree of freedom. They even ministered to \nHindu prisoners awaiting execution.23\nDepending on the demand for road labourers and finished goods other \nprisoners were engaged in indoor work, such as stone breaking and oakum picking or \nmore skilled occupations like net, basket, shoe and mat making, tailoring, and canvas \nstitching.\n \n24 The gendering evident in the early nineteenth-century Bagne continued in \nthe penal workplace, though rather than working indoors at stone breaking, in a \nfurther development of expressive discourses about the appropriate employment of \nwomen, female prisoners were more likely to be kept at \u2018domestic\u2019 labour such as \nsewing or grinding corn. Whilst putting women to remunerative labour was a motive, \nsuch penal organization also expressed metropolitan concerns with the division of \ngendered private\/public workspace. A common lament during the middle of the \nnineteenth century was that with the decline in the slave, apprentice and creole prison \npopulation and the rise in the number of Indians, prisoners no longer had the skills for \nparticular types of prison industry and so profits declined considerably. South Asian \nmigrants were of course mainly cultivators or agriculturalists who had travelled to the \nisland to work on the plantations. Few had experience in other types of work such as \nsewing and weaving, or the more specialized occupations of blacksmith, mason or \ncooper. In 1851, when Indians made up about three quarters of the Mauritian prison \npopulation, the prison committee put a figure on the effect of the decreasing numbers \n 8 \nof artisans. Between 1846 and 1850, prison receipts fell from \u00a3999-19-0 to \u00a3284-13-4, \nmost of the latter earned through the sale of broken stones. The annual number of cart \nloads of stones produced for the municipality correspondingly increased: from 3,883 \nto 16,893 during the same period.25\nDespite concerns about falling prison profits, and the prison committee\u2019s \noccasional calls for the abolition of extra-mural labour on the grounds of good order \nand discipline, outdoor work attracted little consistent criticism until the mid-1850s \nwhen the prison committee argued more forcefully for instructive labour inside jails. \nThis, it said, would be good for discipline and effect moral reform.\n  \n26 A decade later, \npenal administrators were beginning to consolidate the view that real hard labour \ncould never exist on the island. This was because of their growing belief that, like the \nenslaved, Indians bound to contracts of indenture preferred imprisonment to estate \nlabour.27 The Powder Mills prison committee complained of the openness with which \nprisoners stated that the jails were more comfortable than the estates.28 Indeed, an \n1860 memorial signed by twenty planters in the districts of Plaines Wilhems and \nMoka alleged that imprisonment made Indian labourers insubordinate, for rations \nwere so abundant and work so light that on release they declared that they would do \nwhatever was necessary to return to jail.29 There was perhaps some truth in these \nperceptions; despite the almost complete lack of surveillance over working prisoners, \nthere were few escapes. One contemporary visitor compared the output of prisoners \nwith that of indentured labourers thus: \u2018the way in which the men condemned to the \nroads creep along with their baskets on their heads, and sleepily tilt over the contents \nat a given spot, at once convinces you on which side the superiority lies\u2019.30 Of \nsignificance in this respect is that the Mauritian surveyor general - not the prison \ndiscipline committees - had authority over prison gangs once they were out at work. \n 9 \nInevitably, efficient labour rather than penal discipline was at the top of his agenda. \nThe only involvement the prison committees had was in the punishment of prisoners \nwho absolutely refused to work.31 The inspector-general of prisons thus wrote in 1866 \nthat prisons were nothing more than \u2018dormitories for the surveyor general\u2019s working \nparties\u2019.32\nThe issue for the Port Louis and district prison committees was that of less \neligibility, i.e. the need to create jails that were less attractive than the plantations but \ndid not deprive prisoners of basic food, lodging or health. There was the further issue \nof how to punish recalcitrant prisoners, for in 1835 progressive legislation had been \npassed banning corporal punishment in prison. Both plantation owners and penal \nofficials feared that this created jails as places of refuge from the arbitrary violence \nthat some indentured labourers experienced on sugar estates, and thus ameliorated \nconsiderably the working conditions of some (incarcerated) labourers. Frequently, \nprisoners refused to work, and deprived of the array of negative incentives available \nto overseers on the plantations, there was little their prison overseers could do. With \nfew other weapons at their disposal, the Port Louis prison committee proposed \nsuccessfully in 1851 that flogging should be reintroduced.\n \n33 Though the maximum \nnumber of lashes was set at thirty through 1858 legislation, jail flogging remained in \nforce until it was abolished finally in 1884. And yet there is no question that during \nthis period for some indentured labourers jail remained, as their employers feared, \npreferable to estate labour. Especially during the early period of indenture when there \nwas a massive sex-ratio imbalance within the indentured community, one of the main \ndeterrents of imprisonment \u2013 social dislocation and rupture \u2013 had little resonance. On \nthe other hand, labourers benefited considerably from a shorter working day, as time \nspent getting to and from work were included in the hours of labour. Moreover, \n 10 \nprisoners commonly used the Port Louis prison committee as a conduit for complaints \nabout their contracts, mostly about non-payment of wages as a result of the notorious \n\u2018double cut\u2019 (the docking of two days\u2019 pay for each day off). That the committee \nordered full investigations into each case perhaps reveals something of the broader \ntensions between the British government and the largely French planter class on the \nisland in the treatment of indentured labourers.  \nThe inspector-general\u2019s reservations about the usefulness of prison work \ngangs coincided with further metropolitan enquiries into the management of prisons \nin the colonies during the 1860s. One of London\u2019s main focal points was the penal \nefficacy of labour. In an interesting departure from contemporary beliefs and practices \nin Mauritius (as indeed in other colonies) about the desirability of remunerative prison \nlabour, the metropolitan government argued that effective punishment was sacrificed \nwhen \u2018industrial and productive employment is substituted \u2026 for labour strictly \npenal.\u2019 The metropolitan view was that the non-productive crank and the tread wheel \nwere essential to all those condemned to hard labour, and industrial employment \nshould only be attempted during the later stage of long sentences of imprisonment. \nEven then, economy and profit should be secondary considerations to penal \ndiscipline. Industrial labour, the government argued, was altogether \u2018less penal, \nirksome and fatiguing\u2019.34 As a result of this intervention the Mauritian government set \nup a commission of enquiry which toured prisons across the island during the 1870s. \nThis was the spur to the opening of a new central prison with proper facilities for \nindoor employment in 1887. Situated away from the capital in the more salubrious \nclimate of the highland plateau at Beau Bassin, this was arguably the beginning of the \nshift from public penal display towards more discrete forms of imprisonment. \n 11 \nPrisoners were kept to indoor work away from the gaze of the capital\u2019s inhabitants, \nand the outdoor work gang was abolished altogether.  \nThe recommendations of the 1865-7 British enquiry on prison discipline \ndeparted from extant practices in Mauritius (and indeed elsewhere in the empire) in \nthat it recommended the type of unproductive work usually reserved for prison \noffences \u2013 the crank and the tread wheel \u2013 for the early stages of punishment, as well \nas an additional sanction. The enquiry also mentioned the potential use of shot drill in \nthis respect, and subsequently it was introduced in the House of Correction in 1866 \nwhere it became part of the daily routine of all prisoners. Indoor labour thus became a \nmix of productive and unproductive labour, and so moved closer to metropolitan \naspirations. In the colonial context, shot drill had further significance, for it was an \nintensely theatrical performance through which the balance of power moved away \nfrom prisoners as important productive agents and towards their engagement in a \nuseless and demeaning penal ritual. Of those working inside jail, each prisoner was \nemployed at shot drill for a quarter of each hour of the working day. The rest of the \nhour was to be spent picking oakum or if there was none, \u2018sitting quietly in their \nplaces\u2019. For a band of sixty prisoners, the drill \u2013 as the inspector-general of prisons \nexplained - was as follows (Figure I).  \n \nFigure 1: Shot Drill \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 \n17 18 189 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 \n33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 \n49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 \n \n 12 \nEach prisoner was placed in one of the spaces (each was five feet square), except \nnumbers 16, 32, 48 and 64, which were left unoccupied. A quantity of shot was \nplaced in front of each prisoner. All the prisoners faced the director of the drill, who \nstood before spaces one, 17, 33 and 49. He then gave the command \u2018Lift Shot!\u2019 at \nwhich the prisoners stooped down and lifted up a shot each, standing \u2018erect and \nquietly with the shot in front of the body.\u2019 The drill continued: \n \n1. \u201cTo the left face\u201d. The prisoners face to the left and remain steady. \n2. \u201cMarch\u201d. Every prisoner takes 2 or 3 paces to bring him into the space adjoining \nthat which he originally occupied; and without command turn towards the director. \nThus no. 15 moves into no. 16, no. 14 into 15 and so on for the first line and so on, \nsimilar movements taking place in all the lines simultaneously.  \n3. \u201cLay down shot\u201d. All the prisoners lay down the shot quietly on the ground and \nthen stand up. The spaces numbered 1, 17, 33 and 49 are now empty. \n \nThe director then repeated his commands, substituting \u2018to the right face\u2019 for \u2018to the \nleft space\u2019, to bring the prisoners back to their original spot. These movements \nbackwards and forwards were repeated forty times in fifteen minutes, after which the \nnext band of prisoners took their turn. The inspector-general reported with some \npleasure how much prisoners disliked the drill.35\n \n  \nBANISHMENT, EXILE AND TRANSPORTATION IN AN ISLAND COLONY \n \nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, there was a further penal option open to \nthe Mauritian administration: the transportation of convicts from Mauritius to Robben \n 13 \nIsland, off the Cape (until 1834) or to the Australian penal settlements in New South \nWales and Van Diemen\u2019s Land (1834-45). The government shipped over one hundred \nlocally convicted convicts overseas.36 Amongst these convicts were slaves, \napprentices, convicts - originally transported from India to Mauritius and therefore \nsentenced to retransportation - and indentured Indian and Chinese immigrants. Their \noffences \u2013 arson, robbery, assault - reveal many of the social and economic pressures \nto which the Mauritian workforce was subject. The punishment of transportation itself \nwas a permanent form of social removal that had potentially devastating \nconsequences on the mostly male convicts\u2019 families, as revealed in the often desperate \npetitions submitted to government by their wives, mothers and siblings.37\nMauritius itself was a relatively isolated and sea bound island space that was \nattractive as a place of banishment, exile or transportation. The first exile to Mauritius \nwas a free man from Martinique who was sent to \u00cele de France from Paris in the \n1770s.\n \n38 Between 1803 and 1810, with France at war with Britain, the famous \nexplorer Matthew Flinders together with his shipmates and other prisoners of war \nwere held there.39 The Bagne\u2019s most famous resident was Ratsitatanana, the nephew \nof King Radama I of Madagascar, who was sent to the island in exile in 1821. Within \na few months he escaped, supposedly to lead a slave rebellion. He was tried and \nconvicted, and was executed in 1822. In a powerful visual warning against further \nanti-colonial intrigues, his head was placed on a stake and put on public display high \nup in the mountains above Port Louis.40 It both symbolized and expressed the \nanxieties of Mauritian colonists, who were uncertain about the future of the institution \nof slavery in the aftermath of the abolition of the slave trade. And yet, as Pier Larson \nhas shown, the \u2018slave conspiracy\u2019 of 1822 was in large part a myth borne out of \ncolonial paranoia. Moreover, Ratsitatanana himself was an unlikely and improbable \n 14 \nleader. He came from a powerful Malagasy family itself involved in the slave trade.41 \nOther exiles included Kandyan aristocrats from Ceylon. One of the men \u2013 Ehelepola \u2013 \ncut a dashing figure as he rode around the island on horseback and dined with the \ngovernor.42 There is still a memorial to him on the island today. Mauritius was also a \nplace to which Indian convicts were transported. When the first British governor of \nMauritius, Robert Farquhar, arrived on the island three years after the abolition of the \nslave trade, in the face of a potentially serious labour crisis he asked the Bengal \nauthorities to send him a supply of convicts. Subsequently the authorities transported \nalmost fifteen hundred Indian offenders, and the Mauritian government assumed \nresponsibility for their cost in exchange for the value of their labour. They were \njoined by a handful of ordinary offenders from the crown colony of Ceylon.43\n \n  \nTHE VAGRANT DEPOT \n \nThe introduction of indentured labourers created new law and order concerns in \ncolonial Mauritius, for in the face of often harsh conditions Indians deserted their \nlabour contracts in large numbers. The government\u2019s desire to control this new \nworkforce \u2013 coupled with assumptions about the \u2018obstinate idleness\u2019 believed to be so \ncentral to the Indian \u2018character\u2019 - underpinned the development of vagrancy \nlegislation in colonial Mauritius, as also new penal strategies. As we have seen, there \nwas a long history of slave marronage on the island and so it is perhaps unsurprising \nthat post-emancipation the types of measures used against runaway slaves and \napprentices were adapted for the control of Indian indentured labourers. Early \nordinances created the offence of vagabondage and criminalized desertion and illegal \nabsence from work.44 Vagrancy legislation followed in 1852, 1867 and 1878, the \n 15 \nlatter further defining the vagrant as someone with no fixed residence, no means of \nsubsistence and no regular employment.45 In practice it created a legal framework that \ntied workers to their employers by restricting their movement and preventing them \nfrom seeking better pay and conditions. It also constituted a new type of prisoner. \nDuring this period thousands of vagrants passed through Port Louis jail. Between \n1852 and 1862, over 30,000 were committed. In 1863 alone the figure was 7,000 \nvagrants \u2013 almost five per cent of the total male Indian population then on the \nisland.46 The scale of the problem was considered such that in 1864 the authorities \ndecided to open a separate jail for the imprisonment of those convicted of desertion: \nthe Vagrant Depot. It is no coincidence that this was a period of major restructuring in \nthe Mauritian sugar industry after both sugar prices and immigration tailed off. As \nRichard B. Allen shows, at this time of economic distress it was essential to mobilize \nand control the colony\u2019s agricultural labour force.47\n The Vagrant Depot was from the beginning more than tangential to the history \nof incarceration and forced labour in Mauritius, for it was situated on the site of the \nold Indian convict barracks at Grand River, just outside Port Louis.\n \n48 There was more \nthan a spatial connection to the type of penal discipline employed there too. Convicted \nvagrants were sentenced to a term at the depot, and were employed at hard labour \nwhilst they were there \u2013 mainly stone breaking and carting for road building and \nmending projects. Initially the inspector-general of police was appointed \nsuperintendent in charge of a keeper and staff of police constables. A visiting \nmagistrate carried out weekly inspections. He was empowered to punish vagrants for \nany misdemeanours. Flogging, solitary confinement and reduced rations were all used \nfor a range of offences including insulting, threatening or assaulting the guard, \nrefusing to work and disobedience of orders. There is some suggestion that discipline \n 16 \nat the depot was more severe than in some of the island\u2019s local prisons. One district \nprison committee certainly expressed this view.49 In 1878 the depot was declared part \nof Port Louis jail and control passed to the Port Louis prison committee. From then on \nit held petty offenders as well as vagrants. By 1880 its average lock-up was 165 \nprisoners.50 The depot remained open until 1886, when it closed during the more \ngeneral reform of prisons across the island. Vagrants were then housed either in Port \nLouis prison or the district jails, at least until the new central prison at Beau Bassin \nopened a year later. Local planters were perhaps glad to regain control of their \nvagrants. Indeed, some held the view that they should be made to work in the district \nin which they were convicted, their labour making up for the losses planters incurred \nwhen indentured labourers deserted. Similar opinions were expounded by district \nprison committees, who for the same reasons were often unwilling to transfer locally-\nconvicted labourers to Port Louis.51\n \n  \nCONCLUSION \n \nProvoked by ongoing metropolitan concerns about the abolition of outdoor labour, in \n1887 the government opened a new central jail in the highland plateau at Beau Bassin. \nThis marked a radical change in the dynamics of incarceration, for together with the \nconcurrent abolition of outdoor prison work gangs the transfer of prisoners out of the \nMauritian capital largely removed imprisonment from public view, and so changed \nthe dynamics of incarceration in significant ways. Indeed, it is clear that during the \nfirst half of the nineteenth century and despite the British regime\u2019s creation of a \nrepertoire of spaces of less eligibility for the control of their workforce, in practice \nslaves, apprentices and indentured labourers subverted the disciplinary intent of the \n 17 \ncolonial jail in ameliorating their living and working conditions. Jails were not closed \nplaces of confinement, but permeable institutions through which prisoners moved and \nworked. As such, incarceration was central to Mauritian politics of labour and \nmigration.  \n                                                 \n1 Research for this article was conducted in the National Archives in Kew (NA) and \nthe National Archives of Mauritius (NAM).
