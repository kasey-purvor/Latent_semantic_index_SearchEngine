However, in 2003 it was superseded by plans for the establishment of Children's Centres, a universal programme rather than one for disadvantaged areas as in the case of Sure Start local programmes.

However, in 2003 it was superseded by plans for the\nestablishment of Children\u2019s Centres, a universal programme rather than one for disadvantaged\nareas as in the case of Sure Start local programmes. The government claimed that the shift to\nChildren\u2019s Centres represented continuity, but, using historical methods and key informant\ninterviews, this paper shows that there was considerable change, particularly in the programme\ncontent and governance of the new centres. The paper explores the reasons for the policy shift\nin terms of factors arising from changes in government\u2019s goals for Sure Start and for children\u2019s\nservices more broadly on the one hand, and from evidence of programme failure on the other.\nIt concludes by reflecting on why the shift to Children\u2019s Centres was claimed as continuity\nrather than change, and what this tells us about the nature of policy change.\nSure Start was one of a number of social policy initiatives brought forward by\nthe New Labour government in the late 1990s, which incorporated ideas about\nthe importance of area-based initiatives (in health as well as education),1 of\nstrengthening communities, of tackling social exclusion and child poverty in\nparticular, of making interventions \u2018evidence-based\u2019 and of \u2018modernising\u2019 public\nservices by encouraging joined-up government and an \u2018integrated\u2019 approach\nthat cut across departmental and professional boundaries (Blair, 1997). Labour\nmade family policy an explicit part of its legislative programme and devoted\nparticularly large expenditure to subsidising part-time early years education for\nall three and four-year olds and childcare on both the demand and supply sides.\nThe amount spent on Sure Start was less, but it was a \u2018flagship\u2019 policy for the new\nadministration that was also perceived to be popular (Glass, 2006; Eisenstadt,\n2002).2\nSure Start was an early intervention programme, intended to bring together\na range of services, including family support, health services and support for\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\n72 jane lewis\nspecial needs as well as childcare and education, in disadvantaged areas. The\naim was to \u2018invest\u20193 in early childhood and to \u2018help to ensure that children,\nparticularly those at risk of social exclusion are ready to learn when they arrive\nat school\u2019 (HMT, 1998: para. 1.14). Beginning in 1998 with 60 \u2018trailblazer\u2019 local\nprogrammes (SSLPs) and with a further 250 SSLPs planned, expenditure was\nmore than doubled in 2000 in order to fund 530 programmes by 2004.4 Labour\nmade a ten-year funding commitment to Sure Start and also funded a major\nnational evaluation project.\nIt took three years for an SSLP to reach maturity, and the final wave of\nlocal programmes was not approved until 2002. Yet in 2003 it was decided that\nSSLPs would be replaced by Children\u2019s Centres, which would cover the whole\ncountry, albeit with a limited set of services for better-off areas. By 2006, the\nmajority of Sure Start local programmes were functioning as Children\u2019s Centres.\nNaomi Eisenstadt, the Director of the Sure Start Unit set up in 1998 under\nthe auspices of both the DfES and DH, wrote in 2003 to assure Sure Start local\nprogrammes that \u2018by embedding SSLPs in the local authority\u2019s strategic vision for\nthe delivery of children\u2019s services in your area, we will ensure that the additional\nChildren\u2019s Centres\u2019 funding will build on what you have already started and\nimprove mainstream services\u2019 (Eisenstadt, 2003). In this interpretation, the move\nto create a network of Children\u2019s Centres represented the \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 of\nSure Start into a universal service. Indeed, the new Children\u2019s Centres were\ncalled \u2018Sure Start Children\u2019s Centres\u2019, with advice offered by the Sure Start Unit\n(DfES, 2006) on logos and \u2018rebranding\u2019, reflecting the importance of \u2018market\nrecognition\u2019 in what has always been a mixed economy of early years childcare\nand education provision. However, some local authorities preferred to refer to the\nnew centres simply as \u2018Children\u2019s Centres\u2019 from the first,5 and by the late 2000s\nthis usage was also common in many of the policy documents emanating from\ncentral government. Indeed, because Children\u2019s Centres were to be a universal\nservice, only a minority originated in SSLPs. Many more were added onto schools\nand to existing early years provision such as neighbourhood nurseries and\nearly excellence centres, and some to primary health care trust buildings and\ncommunity centres.\nThis paper examines the extent to which the transition to Children\u2019s Centres\nrepresented continuity or change, and suggests that while the policy was framed6\nin terms of continuity, in practice the extent to which changes were made was just\nas striking. In particular, governance underwent radical change and, while many\nelements of the Children\u2019s Centres\u2019 offer looked similar to those of SSLPs, the\nemphasis was rather different, particularly in the importance accorded childcare\nand early years education.\nThe paper uses historical methods to explore, first, the nature of the shift\nin policy, drawing on the full range of policy documents from the Department\nof Education and Skills (from 2007 the Department of Children, Schools and\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\nfrom sure start to children\u2019s centres 73\nFamilies), the Treasury, the Sure Start Unit, Parliamentary Papers and the official\nguidance. The findings of the National Evaluation of Sure Start are used both for\nthe information they provide about the workings of the SSLPs and for the part\nthey played in influencing policy. Second, the paper explores what these sources\nreveal as to reasons for the policy shift, in terms of changes in the government\u2019s\nown agenda and external pressures. This part of the paper also draws on key\ninformant interviews, which provided very different perspectives on the key\nreasons for the promotion of Children\u2019s Centres,7 and documentary evidence\nfrom two London boroughs. Finally, the paper reflects on the implications for a\nbroader understanding of policy change, drawing attention to the importance of\nthe role of strategic framing and of the politics of policy-making in particular.\nSure Start local programmes\nProvision for young children under four was made the subject of one of New\nLabour\u2019s cross-departmental reviews when it came to power in 1997. Officials\nfrom 11 government departments considered academic papers suggesting that\nevidence from the UK and the US showed that early intervention programmes\nwere important for the development and life experience of children (HMT,\n1998; see also Waldfogel, 1999; Melhuish, 2004). The aim of the programme\nthat emerged from the Review process \u2013 Sure Start \u2013 was intended to improve\nchildren\u2019s health and their social, emotional and cognitive development, and to\nstrengthen families and communities in disadvantaged areas. School readiness\nwas thus defined more widely than cognitive development, as was also the case\nwith the American Head Start programme, which was begun in 1965 as both a\nchild and community development programme in the context of the wider War\non Poverty (Zigler and Styfco, 2004). The policy problem was identified by British\npolicy-makers mainly in terms of family functioning and child poverty among\nthe socially excluded, and the thinking behind the creation of Sure Start focused\non finding a more integrated approach to tackling social exclusion among young\nchildren and their families (HMT, 1998; Glass, 1999). There were large hopes for\nSure Start, which was seen as something of a \u2018magic bullet\u2019 that would, in the\nlong term, help to reduce youth crime, teenage pregnancy, family breakdown\nand poverty. The introductory booklet accompanying the setting up of the fifth\nwave of SSLPs in 2002 talked of \u2018breaking the cycle of disadvantage\u2019 (DfES,\n2001, Foreword). However, Professor Sir Michael Rutter, adviser to the national\nevaluation project, stated that, in his view, the \u2018Government statements on what\nit wanted SSLPs to achieve have lacked both consistency and precision\u2019 (Rutter,\n2007: 199).\nThe Sure Start local programmes launched in 1998 offered outreach and\nhome visits; support for families and parents (including support groups, drop-in\nand parenting sessions); support for good-quality play, learning and childcare;\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\n74 jane lewis\nprimary and community healthcare and advice about child and family health; and\nsupport for children with special needs. These constituted the core offer, but SSLPs\ncould also provide additional services: for example, advice on housing or welfare\nbenefits. The local programmes could offer a particular service themselves, or give\nmoney to a provider to fund more of a particular service (for example, an extra\nhealth visitor), or provide information to parents as to where to seek help. As\nthe National Evaluation showed, SSLPs were able to call on different amounts of\nexisting provision, and while most \u2018inherited\u2019 reasonable health provision, there\nwas usually little by way of childcare (Allnock et al., 2005). Each SSLP enjoyed\nautonomy and, while it was obliged to provide the core offer and to work towards\nnationally determined targets, how it did so was up to each local programme to\ndecide.\nA set of key principles was laid down for SSLPs in the first official Guidance\noffered by government: to coordinate, streamline and add value to existing\nservices (which required staff to work in cooperative and new ways); to involve\nparents; to avoid stigma; to ensure lasting support for children and families; to act\nin culturally appropriate and sensitive ways; to achieve specific objectives; and to\npromote accessibility for all local families (DfEE, 1999a). Naomi Eisenstadt (2002:\n3, 4) commented that \u2018probably\u2019 the most important of these was the injunction\nto involve parents and carers: \u2018The fundamental premise is that better outcomes\ncan only be achieved with the active participation of parents.\u2019 The National\nEvaluation found that parents were represented on the partnership boards of all\nthe 12 SSLPs studied in depth (Ball, 2002). Parents were also to be the subjects of\nmany dimensions of the intervention. Indeed, only provision for special needs\nand for early years education8 focused on the child alone; other parts of the\nSSLPs\u2019 core offer were usually focused on the parent and child, or the parent\nalone (Tunstill et al., 2005a). Many SSLPs expected parents to be present while\ntheir children were attending a childcare session at the SSLP in order to learn how\nto interact with their child (Anning et al., 2005).9 Engaging local communities and\nlocal parents was central to the ethos of Sure Start (although, turning this on its\nhead, Clark (2006) has argued that Sure Start was as much about the promotion\nof good parenting and the effective surveillance of mothers in particular (see also\nHey and Bradford, 2006)).\nCertainly, the national targets for Sure Start reflected the focus on parents\n(invariably mothers) as much as children. In common with all public services,\nPublic Service Agreements (PSAs) were set by the Treasury for Sure Start. Thus,\nunder the health objective, targets were set for reducing the proportion of mothers\nwho smoked, for increasing the proportion who breastfed and for reducing the\nproportion of children admitted to hospital. The PSAs for children\u2019s cognitive,\nsocial and emotional development proved both hard to measure and difficult to\nachieve. In practice, as Ellison et al. (nd, circa 2004\u20135: 23, 15) commented, there\nwas an \u2018inevitable artificiality about the way activities [in SSLPs] are allocated to\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\nfrom sure start to children\u2019s centres 75\nPSA targets\u2019 not least because \u2018the targets themselves were not necessarily what\nSure Start has actually been trying to achieve\u2019. Many SSLPs made substantial\nefforts to increase parental self-esteem and confidence, which were also hard to\nmeasure and did not in any case figure in the PSA targets. Sure Start delivered\na range of services, depending on local demand and assessment of need. But\nsome targets, for instance achieving a reduction in mothers who smoked, were\nnot necessarily supported by the local community (Fox, 2005). As one London\nvoluntary agency contracted to provide services put it: \u2018Sure Start is a very target\ndriven process, but parents are told that it is their wishes that are paramount.\nOften they cannot reconcile these two concepts\u2019 (sic) (Westminster Children\u2019s\nSociety, 2003: 2).\nThe PSAs were frequently reviewed and the emphasis shifted substantially\nover time. The 2002 Spending Review specifically changed the aims of Sure Start\nto include an increase in the availability of childcare as a separate aim and, by\n2004, the provision of childcare was tied firmly to the target of getting parents into\nemployment. But SSLPs did not develop into major childcare providers and in\nfact the Neighbourhood Nursery Initiative in disadvantaged areas complemented\nSure Start in this respect.10 Norman Glass, who as a civil servant in the Treasury\nhad been involved in the setting up of Sure Start, maintained that supporting\nparents into work was \u2018an ambition for which it arguably was not funded, let\nalone intended\u2019 (Glass, 2006: 55). Because of its wide aims, it was possible for\nSure Start to mean all things to all people, but the ethos of Sure Start local\nprogrammes was centred on local responsiveness, parent participation and child\ndevelopment. There was no specific focus on early years education and care linked\nto the provision of opportunities for parental employment.\nChildren\u2019s Centres\nThe core offer for the Children\u2019s Centres launched in 2003 was: integrated\nearly education and care, parental outreach, family support, health services,\ninformation about other childcare providers and community services, effective\nlinks with Jobcentre Plus and workforce training. Children\u2019s Centres were to be a\nuniversal service, but in the 70 per cent of areas that were better off, the intention\nwas to focus mainly on the provision of an information service. The greatest\nemphasis was put on the need to provide integrated childcare and early years\neducation, and to reach the most disadvantaged, hard-to-reach parents \u2013 both\naims being strongly associated with the concern to promote adult employment\nand to address the issue of workless families, which are disproportionately\nnumerous in the UK compared to other EU Member States (NAO, 2007). The first\nmajor report of quantitative findings from the National Evaluation had identified\nthis group as being particularly hard to reach by SSLPs (NESS, 2005). Increasing\nconcern about the evidence-base for programmes delivered by SSLPs, also raised\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\n76 jane lewis\nby the National Evaluation, resulted in an effort to promote more standardised\nfamily support programmes from the list issued by the National Academy of\nParenting Practitioners, established in 2007.\nThe principles underpinning Children\u2019s Centres were said to be the same\nas SSLPs; Margaret Hodge, the Minister responsible, told the Select Committee\non Education and Skills that Children\u2019s Centres would be \u2018community driven,\nparent driven and will retain that essence of Sure Start which has made it so\nsuccessful\u2019 (House of Commons Education and Skills Committee, 2005, Q. 479).\nIn 2006, Beverley Hughes, Minister for Children and Families, described the Sure\nStart local programmes to this Committee in terms of an \u2018experimental stage\u2019,\nwhich had let a \u2018thousand flowers bloom\u2019 (House of Commons Education and\nSkills Committee, 2006, Q. 7), laying the groundwork for the new universal,\nmainstream service. These statements were part of a series of ex post facto\nconstructions of the shift from SSLPs to Children\u2019s Centres in terms of continuity\nrather than change. Yet in the new emphasis on childcare and education and on\nthe nature of governance, change was more apparent than continuity.\nChildren\u2019s Centres were first mooted in the 2002 Report of the Inter-\nDepartmental Committee on Childcare as a particularly effective way of providing\ngood-quality, integrated childcare and early years education (DfES, DWP, HMT\nand Women and Equality Unit, 2002, chapter 4). A major focus of this report\nwas on ways of meeting the government\u2019s objective of getting 70 per cent of lone\nmothers into work, which in turn was seen as part of what was needed to halve\nchild poverty by 2010. The much greater place given to childcare provision in the\ncore offer of Children\u2019s Centres from their launch in 2003 was reflected in the\nchanges in governance at central government level. In 2002, cross-departmental\nresponsibility for Sure Start moved from the DfES and the DH to the DfES and the\nDWP. The Sure Start Unit was merged with the Early Years Division and Childcare\nUnit, creating a single group responsible for SSLPS, neighbourhood nurseries and\nthe National Childcare Strategy, underlining the stronger emphasis on childcare\nand its connection to supporting parents into work. Children\u2019s Centres were set\ntargets for the creation of new childcare places and, from September 2008, centres\nwere obliged to provide fully integrated early years education and full daycare,\nwhich the Effective Provision of Pre-School Education (EPPE) project had found\nto be particularly beneficial for child outcomes (Sylva et al., 2004).\nIn respect of local governance, Children\u2019s Centres were made the\nresponsibility of local authorities, which managed the allocation of the\ngovernment grant (SSLPs had been funded directly by the DfES, with the lead\npartner on the partnership board managing the grant). In part, this change also\nreflected the focus on childcare and education. The 2002 Inter-Departmental\nReview of childcare pointed out that the Early Years Development and Childcare\nPartnerships, which had been given the responsibility of managing the childcare\nmarket at the local level in 1998 (Lewis, 2003; Penn and Randall, 2005), were\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\nfrom sure start to children\u2019s centres 77\nmore successful when the local authority was actively involved (DfES, DWP,\nHMT, Women and Equality Unit, 2002), and the 2006 Childcare Act gave local\nauthorities a statutory responsibility to ensure that there were enough childcare\nplaces for parents in work or training. In part, the change was also linked to the\nprofound restructuring of children\u2019s services undertaken under the auspices of\nthe Every Child Matters agenda (HMT, 2003), launched in 2003, for it would have\nproved difficult to leave SSLPs outside the reconfigured services for children at\nthe local level.\nThe first, brief, official guidance for Children\u2019s Centres issued in 2003\nreiterated the need to involve parents, but by consultation above all, and to\ndevelop an understanding of community development rather than to encourage\nactive participation, as had been the intention with SSLPs.11 While SSLPs were\nnever \u2018bottom-up\u2019, in so far as parents were very much a minority voice on\nthe partnership boards responsible for their governance, responsiveness to local\nneeds and preferences, community development and empowerment were explicit\naims of the programme (Williams and Churchill, 2006) in a way that they were\nnot for Children\u2019s Centres.\nChildren\u2019s Centres were made part of \u2018mainstream\u2019 provision for young\nchildren in all local authorities, but it is less certain as to whether in so doing a\nSure Start approach was \u2018mainstreamed\u2019. The local responsiveness that had let a\nthousand flowers bloom in terms of the nature and balance of the SSLPs\u2019 service\noffer gave way to a more specified service offer with an emphasis on integrated\nchildcare and education for children in conjunction with links to Jobcentre Plus\nfor their parents, and greater control by the local authority to make sure it\nhappened. A similar trajectory from a community-oriented to a more centrally\nmandated programme marked the experience of Head Start in the US (Levitan,\n1969; Cohen, 1996). Newly created Children\u2019s Centres were often attached to\nschools (as had been the EECs),12 which reflected the importance attached to\nearly years education and care in the Children\u2019s Centres\u2019 offer and to the new\nrequirements under the 2006 Childcare Act for local authorities to ensure an\nadequate number of places.\nHowever, \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 Sure Start into a universal service had significant\ncost implications. On average, SSLPs in their third year of operation spent \u00a3900\nper child (at 1999\u20132000 prices), with a minimum spend of \u00a3350 and a maximum\nof almost \u00a32,500 (Meadows, 2006). The funding for Children\u2019s Centres was less\nthan that for SSLPs. The Minister responsible, Beverly Hughes, told the 2006\nSelect Committee on Education and Skills that it was close to 66\u201370 per cent of\nthe level reached by SSLPs (House of Commons Education and Skills Committee,\n2006, Q.29). The Public Accounts Committee expressed fears about the dilution\nof support for disadvantaged areas (House of Commons Committee on Public\nAccounts, 2007), and the National Audit Office (2006) expressed concern about\nthe sustainability of Children\u2019s Centres. At the local level there was also concern\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\n78 jane lewis\nabout \u2018who will pick up the tab on the new services once central government\nmoney dwindles\u2019 (City of Westminster, 2002: 2).\nThe reasons for the policy shift\nThe reasons for the shift to Children\u2019s Centres are related in part to changes in\ngovernment\u2019s policy agenda in respect of the service offer made by SSLPs and of\nservices for young children more generally, and in part to evidence of programme\nfailure offered by the National Evaluation.\nFirst, Sure Start\u2019s ethos and practice became increasingly out of step with\ngovernment policy in regard to childcare. The emphasis on making provision\nfor integrated childcare and education, linked to supporting parents into work,\nwas very different from the relatively minor part accorded childcare in Sure Start\nlocal programmes, and reflected the way in which government\u2019s thinking on\nchildcare in relation to social exclusion had developed. SSLPs had often provided\nsome childcare \u2013 in the form of informal drop-in and \u2018stay and play\u2019 provision\nas well as cre`ches and sessional day care \u2013 mainly in order to encourage parents\nto take part in other Sure Start activities, but their provision of formal childcare\nfor working parents remained low (Tunstill et al., 2005a). The aim was thus to\nsupport parents seeking to attend courses that might improve their employability\nor to enhance the parent\/child relationship. Much less attention was paid to the\ncognitive development of children, especially in the cre`ches (Anning et al., 2005;\nsee also Mathers et al., 2007). In their report for the National Evaluation on the\nemployability of parents in 25 SSLPs, Meadows and Garbers (2004) concluded\nthat SSLPs acted mainly as a bridge for parents into the education, training and\nemployment services of other organisations, not least because of the common\nlocal perception that the mothers of young children should stay at home. No\nSSLP in their sample told parents that they should be working.\nBut in 2003, the Work and Pensions Select Committee warned that the\nnumber of childcare places was not likely to be enough to allow the 2010 targets on\nchild poverty and employment for lone mothers to be met (House of Commons\nWork and Pensions Committee, 2003: 15). Government plans for the development\nof childcare over the period 2004\u20132014 (HMT, DfES, DWP and DTI, 2004) made\nspecific reference to the increased contribution that would be made by Children\u2019s\nCentres. At the same time, government was pushing ahead with more out-\nof-school care for older children: by 2010, all schools would be obliged to be\nopen from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. \u2013 the better to serve the needs of working parents.\nSome local authorities made an immediate connection between the need to\nprovide \u2018extended schools\u2019 and new Children\u2019s Centres (for example, City of\nWestminster, 2005: 4\u20135), the majority of which have been located in schools\nrather than other community-based institutions. This in turn tended to give more\nemphasis to educational attainment than to the community-based initiatives and\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\nfrom sure start to children\u2019s centres 79\ncommunity-led services promoted by SSLPs, which were more likely to have been\nbased in community institutions other than schools.\nSecond, the government\u2019s agenda for services for young children\nmore generally underwent substantial change. Children\u2019s services underwent\nfundamental review as a result of the Every Child Matters agenda, implemented\nin the wake of the inquiry into child protection. Stress was placed on the\nimportance of prevention, together with a strong emphasis on children\u2019s\neducational achievement. Integrated services13 for children were to be provided\nunder Directors of Children\u2019s Services appointed by local authorities, and it would\nhave been impractical to leave out the SSLPS, which were accountable directly to\ncentral government in the form of the Sure Start Unit.\nThe new vision of a universal network of integrated children\u2019s services at the\nlocal level also meant the end of Sure Start as an area-based programme. Both the\nNational Evaluation and the Daycare Trust (a long-standing campaigning group\nfor formal childcare provision) had made the point that not all disadvantaged\nchildren lived in deprived areas (Tunstill et al., 2005b; Land, 2002). The provision\nof Mini-Sure Start local programmes in rural areas and in small pockets of\nurban deprivation from 2002 was designed to address this, but pressure for more\nuniversal coverage remained. In 2003, the Work and Pensions Select Committee\nargued in favour of a universal Children\u2019s Centres model (House of Commons\nWork and Pensions Committee, 2003: 22). By the mid-2000s, Labour politicians\nwere speaking of the importance of \u2018progressive universalism\u2019 (for example, Balls,\n2005), which in the case of services meant universal provision, with the greatest\nhelp for those in the most need. This principle was articulated clearly in the\n2005 pre-budget report (HMT and DfES, 2005), and in the 2007 Children\u2019s Plan,\nwhich promoted the idea of universal services operating in a preventative system\n(DCSF, 2007).\nThird, strong evidence of programme failure was offered by the National\nEvaluation, which was all the more serious given the premium the government\nattached to evidence-based policy as a means to its pragmatic commitment to\nidentifying and funding \u2018what works\u2019.\nThe emphasis on area-based programmes in the policy fields of housing,\nhealth and education, as well as early years, faded out of the policy picture,\nlargely because of the tension between central direction and local empowerment\n(see Coote et al., 2004). As Naomi Eistenstadt commented: \u2018The key debate, which\nstill rages about Sure Start, was the commitment to local flexibility; [and] funding\nbased on plans to deliver specific child outcomes rather than specific services\u2019\n(Eisenstadt, 2007: ix). The idea of local flexibility incorporated a commitment to\ncommunity \u2018empowerment\u2019 and to local responsiveness, which sometimes made\nthe pursuit of PSA targets (which, pace Eisenstadt, covered mothers\u2019 behaviour\nas well as children\u2019s welfare and development) difficult. Despite central control,\nSSLPs had enjoyed autonomy in the way in which they went about their work,\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\n80 jane lewis\nwhich resulted in tensions regarding the effectiveness of the programmes they\nchose to use and how far their work was oriented towards achieving better\noutcomes as opposed to community engagement. It was difficult both to work\ntowards PSAs and to put responsiveness to parent-determined needs first.\nThe 1999 Guide to Evidence-based Practice said that Sure Start had been\n\u2018planned on the basis of sound evidence from international research\u2019 (DfEE,\n1999b: 3), but, in their volume summarising the findings of the National\nEvaluation, Melhuish and Hall (2007) claimed that while research evidence was\ncritical in winning the argument for Sure Start at the beginning, it was overlooked\nin the detailed planning and operation of the local programmes. Sure Start had\nno in-built plan for evaluation; each local programme was different in terms of\nthe nature, volume and mix of services it offered. Nor did the initiative require\nthe use of standardised programmes, for example to encourage good parenting.\nAll this made it very difficult to assess the outcomes (Kane, 2008; see also Hansen\nand Hawkes, 2009), which is what the quantitative part of the National Evaluation\nhoped to do and which was particularly important for a government focused on\noutcomes rather than process.\nIt was additionally difficult to come to any quick conclusions about outcomes\nassociated with SSLPs. Not only did the local programmes usually take three years\nto become fully operational, but the hope was that the effects of the programmes\nwould be revealed in terms of school readiness, and also later in the child\u2019s life: for\nexample, in regard to increasing rates of educational achievement and decreasing\nrates of juvenile crime. However, it was expected by some civil servants and\npoliticians that some of the PSA targets set for Sure Start would be achieved in\ntwo or three years. But as Kane (2008)14 argued, it was too early and too difficult\nto assess the impact of Sure Start.\nThe National Evaluation, which started 18 months into the second wave\nof SSLPs (in 2000), published its interim findings in 2005 and they were not\nencouraging. In particular, the National Evaluation found only modest benefits\nfor the moderately disadvantaged and small adverse effects for those most at risk \u2013\nthe very people policy-makers were most concerned to reach (NESS, 2005). A\nsimilar conclusion regarding the effects on the most disadvantaged was reached\nin the US in respect of Early Head Start (Love et al., 2002), which served the\nunder threes.\nGlass (2006) has suggested that government moved to change Sure Start in\nanticipation of these findings. Press reactions to the national evaluation\u2019s interim\nfindings, which were leaked prior to publication, were strong, with a majority\nclaiming that Sure Start had \u2018failed\u2019 (Phillips, 2005; Marrin, 2005; Toynbee, 2005;\nWard, 2005; Wheatcroft, 2005). When the Minister responsible, Margaret Hodge,\nappeared before the Education and Skills Committee in 2005 and said that Sure\nStart Children\u2019s Centres would \u2018retain that essence of Sure Start which has made it\nso successful\u2019 (see above), the Chairman replied that two thirds of SSLPs had been\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\nfrom sure start to children\u2019s centres 81\nshown to be unsuccessful (House of Commons Education and Skills Committee,\n2005, Q.480). A supplementary memorandum submitted by Hodge after her\nappearance before the Committee suggested that no evidence of impact should\nnot be interpreted as evidence of no impact (House of Commons Education and\nSkills Committee, 2005: 191; see also Glass, 2006). In 2006, as the first substantial\nguidance was being issued to Children\u2019s Centres, Tony Blair, then Prime Minister,\ntalked about the importance of reaching the hard-to-reach families, who had\nremained excluded (Blair, 2006). The primary policy goal in setting up Sure\nStart had to do with tackling social exclusion, but the interim findings from the\nNational Evaluation seemed to indicate that it had not succeeded in respect of\nthe most disadvantaged families.\nProfessor Sir Michael Rutter, writing in a personal capacity rather than as\nan adviser to the National Evaluation, criticised policy-makers for rejecting both\npilot projects and a random controlled trial (RCT) when setting up Sure Start,\nwhich he viewed as crucial to the provision of a robust evidence base : \u2018Cynics\nmight also argue that an RCT had to be ruled out because, if it did not show that it\nwas effective, it carried the danger of showing that a key Government policy was a\nmistake\u2019 (Rutter, 2006: 136). He suggested that, in the end, evidence-based policy\nwas trumped by political pressure (Rutter, 2007), and that the mainstreaming of\nSure Start was happening without demonstration of its effectiveness. As Tunstill\net al. (2005a: 168), who were involved in the qualitative research on process for\nthe National Evaluation, put it: \u2018At face value it may be argued that in this case\nnational policy has evolved in advance of conclusive evaluation findings.\u2019\nHowever, it was doubtful that findings from the evaluation could ever\nbe conclusive, given the problems the evaluators faced in establishing causal\nrelationships for a programme that varied so much from place to place. Indeed,\nin 2008, new quantitative findings from the National Evaluation reversed the\nfindings in respect of the most disadvantaged families: now no adverse effects\nwere observed (Melhuish et al., 2008; NESS, 2008). The evaluators concluded,\nalbeit cautiously, that this could be attributed to the \u2018maturing\u2019 of SSLPs as\nthey became Children\u2019s Centres with more \u2018clearly focussed services with better\nguidance\u2019 and claimed that the improvement was \u2018partly influenced by the early\nNESS findings\u2019 (NESS, 2008: 30). They gave the example of the successful use of\nthe same standardised parenting programme in 11 SSLPs in north and mid-Wales\n(Hutchings et al., 2007).15\nBut the idea of politics trumping the best efforts of social scientists was only\npart of the story. The evaluators may well have done the best they could in the\nabsence of rigorous implementation (Rutter, 2007); however, the findings they\npublished in 2005 in particular made them policy actors. These findings may well\nhave influenced the guidance issued in respect of Children\u2019s Centres, but in the\nfirst instance they made it difficult to defend SSLPs. The policy shift to Children\u2019s\nCentres was in part a political reaction to the 2005 findings.16 Notwithstanding\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\n82 jane lewis\nthe shortcomings of the Evaluation\u2019s methodology, the findings made it possible\nto charge Sure Start with \u2018failure\u2019.\nBy the time more positive findings were issued in 2008, SSLPs had been\n\u2018mainstreamed\u2019 according to policy-makers, or, more plausibly in the light of\nthe extent of the changes to the programme, \u2018absorbed\u2019 into Children\u2019s Centres,\nwhich in turn had been brought into the mainstream policy development of\nchildren\u2019s services and childcare and education. The guidance for Children\u2019s\nCentres highlighted the importance of increasing childcare places and of reaching\nthe most disadvantaged families, the first of these being in line with government\u2019s\nown rapidly expanding policy agenda for childcare and early years education, and\nthe second acknowledging the question mark the 2005 National Evaluation posed\nover the SSLPs\u2019 success in tackling social exclusion.17\nChanges in central government\u2019s policy agenda for Sure Start and for policies\nfor young children more generally were important in explaining the shift to\nChildren\u2019s Centres, but it is also the case that government was \u2018hoist on its own\npetard\u2019 of promoting evidence-based policies when the National Evaluation cast\ndoubt over Sure Start\u2019s achievements. The government\u2019s commitment to rapid\nand transformative policy change was difficult to maintain in parallel with a\ncommitment to evidence-based policy development, which is likely to be much\nslower, requiring the use of pilot projects and\/or RCTs, which are in turn likely to\nbe difficult to defend politically in a highly centralised state where differences in\nthe provision of services (for example, in respect of NHS drug policies) are met\nwith public disapproval.\nConclusion: understanding the policy change\nThe transition from SSLPs to Children\u2019s Centres constituted a substantial change\nin policy, which was nevertheless presented by politicians as continuity rather\nthan change. The overarching policy goal of tackling social exclusion remained,\nbut government\u2019s ideas as to how best to achieve it shifted, resulting in changes\nin the programme\u2019s content, governance and reach.\nIn respect of programme content, a focus on support for children and\ntheir parents gave way to an emphasis on children\u2019s cognitive development\non the one hand, and parents\u2019 employment on the other. In addition, the\nmainstreaming of Children\u2019s Centres as a new, universal local service under\nthe control of local government marked a major change from the centralised\ncontrol of SSLPs, which had nevertheless (somewhat paradoxically) enjoyed\nsubstantial autonomy in regard to the service offer they made. While statements\nas to government\u2019s commitment to \u2018empowering\u2019 families continued to be made\n(for example, Cabinet Office and DCSF, 2008), parental participation, together\nwith responsiveness to local demand and local need, gave way to a more centrally\nspecified service offer. The PSAs for Children\u2019s Centres were more closely aligned\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\nfrom sure start to children\u2019s centres 83\nwith the core offer that emphasised early years education and childcare, and links\nwith Jobcentre Plus.\nHowever, representing Children\u2019s Centres as a continuation of the \u2018essence\u2019\nof Sure Start allowed government to claim the success of a flagship programme,\nwhile also changing it significantly to meet both its changing ideas as to how best\nto meet its core goal of tackling social exclusion, as well as academic and press\ncriticism about the failure to reach the most disadvantaged. Taken together these\npoints explain the policy shift, with the negative findings of National Evaluation\nproviding the catalyst for a substantial policy change that was presented as the\ndevelopment of Sure Start.\nThe effort strategically to frame the policy (Campbell, 1998) in terms of\ncontinuity while making important changes enabled government to hang on to\na flagship policy in which considerable investment of public money had been\nmade and to avoid both blame for policy failure in the wake of the National\nEvaluation\u2019s interim findings published in 2005 and a possible backlash by\nvoters angry at the abandonment of a popular programme. Paul Pierson\u2019s (1994)\nwork on policy change in a period of welfare state restructuring has shown\nthe political importance of \u2018blame avoidance\u2019. Thus, a government committed\nto transformative policy change nevertheless sought to claim policy continuity.\nStrategic framing to justify reform and as an aid to the pragmatic politics of\npolicy-making is the most important factor in understanding how politicians\nchanged course on Sure Start.\nThe idea of framing the policy shift as the \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 of Sure Start,\nwhile nevertheless making significant changes, was a way of satisfying both\ncritics of Sure Start and its many committed defenders. In 2008, the government\nannounced its wish to put Sure Start Children\u2019s Centres \u2018on a legislative basis\u2019 to\nensure that they become \u2018an established part of the universal services available for\nyoung children and their families\u2019 (DCSF, 2008a: 1). This will make governance of\nChildren\u2019s Centres much clearer. In addition, having committed large amounts\nof public expenditure first to SSLPs and then to Children\u2019s Centres, this move\nmay be interpreted as a desire institutionally to embed this early years\u2019 initiative\nand to protect it from possible future political attack.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Spencer Foundation and the help of\nNorman Glass, with whom I discussed these issues only a few months before his death.\nNotes\n1 On the fate of the Education Action Zones, see West and Currie (2008) and Halpin et al.\n(2004), and on area-based initiatives more generally see Coote et al. (2004).\n2 Empirical evidence for this came later (Avis et al., 2007; Ridley-Moy, 2007).\n3 By the early 2000s, the language of \u2018social investment\u2019 became more dominant (Lister,\n2003).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 29 Aug 2013 IP address: 158.143.197.48\n84 jane lewis\n4 In 2002\/3 total capital and revenue expenditure on Sure Start was \u00a3680m. In 2003\/4, the first\nyear in which Children\u2019s Centres were also included, and in which spending on childcare\nand some nursery education was merged, the figure rose to \u00a3721m, reaching \u00a3921m in\n2004\/5, \u00a31,240m in 2005\/6 and \u00a31,346m in 2006\/7 (DCSF, 2008b).\n5 For example, Wandsworth Borough Council in London called their centres \u2018integrated\nchildren\u2019s centres\u2019, a designation also used in Wales.\n6 On the importance of \u2018framing\u2019 see Scho\u00a8n and Rein (1994), Blythe (2001) and Campbell\n(1998, 2002).\n7 Interviewees were promised anonymity and confidentiality. It is important to emphasise\nthat this whole piece of policy development is controversial and that key policy actors do\nnot share a common view.\n8 The government\u2019s 1998 National Childcare Strategy included universal provision of\ntwelve and half hours per week early education for four-year olds, followed by the\nsame for three-year olds. This was provided in maintained nursery schools and classes\nand by private, voluntary and independent providers. Very little was provided by\nSSLPs.\n9 The same expectation characterised Head Start programmes in the early years: \u2018In fact, the\nexpectation was that parents would not be working but would be available to participate in\nthe program\u2019 (Cohen, 1996: 31).\n10 There were 1,400 neighbourhood nurseries by 2005 (Smith et al., 2007).\n11 It should be noted that in a 2002 speech about Sure Start, Paul Boateng, then Chief\nSecretary to the Treasury, still talked of the importance of community empowerment;\nhowever, mention of this was notably infrequent after 2003 (Boateng, 2002).\n12 Bertram et al. (2001, 2002) and Sylva and Pugh (2005) assumed that EECs were the model\nfor Children\u2019s Centres; see also Pugh (2003).\n13 The Start-Up Guidance for Children\u2019s Centres, issued in 2003, defined \u2018integration\u2019 in\nterms of a shared philosophy, principles and vision, and, between workers from different\ndisciplines, a shared identity, purpose and working practices (DfES, 2003: 10), but the term\nis defined in different ways by different actors.\n14 Kane (2008) also raised questions about the Evaluation\u2019s methodology (in particular, the\nuse of comparator areas drawn from the Millennium Cohort data, which preceded the\nSSLP data by two years), and how far it was possible to draw conclusions on the basis of\nthose responding to the survey (non-responders may have been equally or more in need of\nservices). The variation in the balance and nature of local service provision, together with\nthe issue of what existed prior to the setting up of Sure State local programmes made it\ndifficult to assess impact.\n15 This was a randomised controlled trial, but unfortunately the date of the fieldwork is not\nspecified.\n16 The early evaluation of Head Start by the Westinghouse Learning Corporation \u2013 Ohio\nUniversity, which also reported negative findings, had a similarly strong political effect\n(Williams and Evans, 1969).\n17 Hilary Armstrong, Minister for the Cabinet Office and Social Exclusion, estimated that 2\nper cent of families had been unable to \u2018take advantage\u2019 of the new opportunities afforded\nby government (Armstrong, 2008: 1).\nReferences\nAllnock, D., Tunstill, J., Meadows, P., Akhurst, S., Chrysanthou, J., Garbers, C. and Morley, A.\n(2005), Implementing Sure Start Local Programmes: An In-depth Study.
