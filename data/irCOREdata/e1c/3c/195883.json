Adult women survivors face the further obstacle of ingrained cultural tendencies to question women\u2019s testimony. Ambiguity and ambivalence are found in adult women\u2019s accounts of their past abuse and present particular dilemmas. Drawing on social remembering approaches developed in memory studies, it is argued that recollections have to negotiate issues of incidence and intentionality in the past as well as the potential contribution made by non-human participants (e.g. objects, spaces, bodies).

Adult women survivors face the further obstacle of \ningrained cultural tendencies to question women\u2019s testimony. Ambiguity and \nambivalence is found adult women\u2019s accounts of their past abuse, but presents \nparticularly dilemmas. Drawing on social remembering approaches developed in \n\u2018memory studies\u2019, it is argued that recollections have to negotiate issues of \nincidence and intentionality in the past, as well as the potential contribution made \nby non-human participants (e.g. objects, spaces, bodies). Using examples from \ninterviews with survivors of child sexual abuse, we illustrate how objects (largely \ndomestic objects and spaces) emerge in the memories as a way of posing and \nsubsequently disposing ambiguity. Objects as well as humans \u2018modify the state \nof affairs\u2019 (Latour, 2005) and serve as the means to punctualise recollected \nepisodes. An analytic approach sensitive to the role of objects is recollection is \noffered which is grounded in material-semiotics.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nMemories lie slumbering within us for months and years, quietly proliferating, \nuntil they are woken by some trifle and in some strange way blind us to life. \nHow often this has caused me to feel that my memories, and the labours \nexpended in writing them down are all part of the same humiliating and, at \nbottom, contemptible business! And yet, what would we be without memory? \nWe would not be capable of ordering even the simplest thoughts, the most \nsensitive heart would lose the ability to show affection, our existence would be \na mere never-ending chain of meaningless moments, and there would not be \nthe faintest trace of a past. How wretched this life of ours its! \u2013 so full of false \nconceits, so futile, that it is little more than shadow of the chimeras loosed by \nmemory. (WG Sebald, 2002: 255) \n \nIntroduction: Memory, agency and child sexual abuse \nDuring one of the many detours into the past that WG Sebald makes in the \ncourse of his perambulations detailed in The Rings of Saturn, the musings of the \nVicomte de Chateaubriand on the relationship between memory and agency are \ndiscussed. Chateaubriand speaks of the fundamental paradox of memory. \nWithout a link to the past we would be unable to lend continuity to existence, to \norder and experience the unfolding of our lives. But at the same time this link \nweighs heavily upon us \u2013 the regret at things done and things not done, the \ncontrast between what might have come to pass and how things actually are. \nThe past is a lure for our current thoughts \u2013 \u2018so full of conceits, so futile\u2019. There \nis, for Chateaubriand, something profoundly humiliating in the business of telling \none\u2019s past, for memory is what simultaneously lends sense to and compromises \nthe present moment.  \n \nSebald\u2019s use of Chateaubriand has the further purpose of pointing out a second, \nmore subtle paradox. To regret what has come to pass implies that one had \nsome choice in the past, some ability to decide a course of action, however \ncircumscribed. What though if it there was in fact no moment of discretion, no \npoint where a decision could be made? Furthermore, what if our ability to speak \n4 \n \nof the past from our present position were itself compromised? Chateaubriand \nhas the comparative luxury, however humiliating he finds it, to speak \nauthoritatively of his own life. But when the past that is recalled is painful, \ntraumatic or abusive then the very act of remembering is rendered problematic \nsince a lack of agency in the past has powerful effects on one\u2019s present \nperspective. If a sense of self and current agency are afforded by the link to the \npast, then what does it mean to recall a past where this freedom and self-\ndetermination are negated? What if the past itself bordered on the unspeakable? \n \nIn this paper we want to examine some of the particular dilemmas and \nambiguities experienced by adult women survivors as they discuss recollections \nof childhood sexual abuse. Such recollections are typically formally understood \nwith reference to juridical concerns over \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019 recall (Hacking, 1995; \nCampbell, 2003). Womens\u2019 testimony about their past abuse is thereby \nconsidered in terms of its literal accuracy. However, there are widely reported \nand well known cultural obstacles confronted by adult women who report \ninstances of sexual violence which renders their ability to offer testimony to their \nown past as being subject to comparatively greater levels of scrutiny (Herman, \n1992; Haaken, 1998; Reavey, 2003). This tendency to see women as \u2018unreliable \nrememberers\u2019 may in part be derived from the history surrounding women\u2019s \ngreater suggestibility and removal from ideals of the rational self, relying as it \ndoes, on notions of reasoned action and agency (Burman, 1994; Hacking, 1995; \nCampbell, 2003). The \u2018subject\u2019 of agency is often more readily aligned to the \n\u2018masculine\u2019, where reason and independence, and thus agency, is more \nculturally readable, given (perceived and actual, in some cases) biological and \ncultural constraints on women (Moore, 1994). It is Chateaubriand, with his \nreasoned and all-knowing reflective recollections on his own past which serves \nas the model, rather than the conflicted, self-doubting and half-spoken testimony \nwhich so often characterises women\u2019s memories of child sexual abuse.  \n \n5 \n \nGiven this, it may seem entirely counter-productive to raise the question of what \nambiguity means in relation to such memories, since it may appear to reinforce \nthe bias against womens\u2019 testimony. Adult recollections of child sexual abuse \u2013 \nfor both men and women \u2013 contain clear and explicit references to experiences \nof powerlessness, violation and lack of agency in the past (Warner, 2000; Baker, \n2002). Abusive relationships leave an indelible mark on the person abused, \nbecause it represents precisely their inability to be an \u2018actor\u2019 in the relationship \nwhich can prevent them from conceiving themselves positively (as an agent) in \ntheir relationships with others (Herman, 1992). \u2018Choice\u2019 and \u2018consent\u2019, for \nexample, (the key tenets of agency) are deeply problematic when it comes to \naddressing women\u2019s sexuality, when the numerous obstacles that prevent adult \nwomen (as well as other minoritised groups) from accessing agency and action \nare considered (Holland et al, 1998; Gavey, 2005). Furthermore, women\u2019s sexual \nagency, especially in childhood, is more easily aligned to a victim role, a role that \ncontinues into the present. The \u2018damage\u2019 created by abuse is perceived to \ncontinue unabated into adulthood, as women are perceived as more likely to \n\u2018repeat\u2019 the abuse, unless interrupted by therapeutic intervention (O\u2019Dell, 2003). \nThus, the chains of meaning, linking past (lack of agency) with present (obstacles \nto agency) are more easily established for women, as their position as agent in \nadulthood is already questionable, given the cultural linking of the masculine with \nagent. This is further confirmed when coming across a growing body of literature \non men\u2019s early sexual experiences. The label  \u2018child sexual abuse\u2019 can more \nreadily be substituted with the term \u2018age discrepant intergenerational sexualities\u2019, \nwherein discourses of sexual pedagogy and \u2018positive\u2019 expressions of early \nsexualities, rather than straightforward sexual villainy, is more thoroughly \nexplored (c.f. Weeks, 1985; 2003).  \n \nNevertheless, in previous work we have argued that women\u2019s memories contain \nnumerous examples of ambivalence and dilemma, if one examines recollections \nmore closely (Reavey, 2003; Reavey & Brown, 2006; 2007; Reavey, in press). \nThrough detailed examinations of qualitative data, involving interviews with \n6 \n \nwomen who have experienced child sexual abuse, we have found that one of the \norganising features of these memories are not clear cut presentations of the past, \nwhere a traditional narrative of the male villain and female victim shape readings \nof agency, but a tremendous dilemma over how to read self agency and the \nagency of others (including the abuser in the past and other people in the \npresent). The difficulty here is that child sexual abuse has developed as a master \nnarrative that has shaped interpretations of the present, including present identity \nand agency (Haaken, 1998; 2003; Reavey, 2003). But the clarity which is \nprovided by this narrative is problematic because it leads us immediately back \ninto the paradox of Chateaubriand\u2019s \u2018wretched life\u2019. To live as a victim is to live \nwith the \u2018chimeras loosed by memory\u2019 rather than as the active agent who can \nmake a reflective turn on their own past in ways that reinforce choice. What we \nwill seek to argue is that acknowledging an element of ambiguity in recollected \npast episodes is crucial to maintaining a sense of agency in the present. \nHowever, as we will hope to demonstrate, ambiguity is mediated by material \naspects of the setting in which abuse originally occurred. \n \nSocial Remembering \nOur approach to recollections of child sexual abuse is guided by the emerging \nfield of \u2018memory studies\u2019. This term covers a broad gamut of work ranging across \nthe natural and human sciences and philosophy which emphasises the social \ndimensions of memory and memorial practices (a very partial list of recent \nsummaries might include see Antze & Lambek, 1996; Brown, 2008; Campbell, \n2003; Daaisma, 2000; Erll & N\u0171nning, 2008; Haaken, 1998; Haaken & Reavey, \n2009; Lowenthal, 1985; Misztal, 2003; Middleton & Brown, 2005; Middleton & \nEdwards, 1990; Schachter, 1996; Schachter & Scarry, 2001; Sutton, 1998; \nYoung, 2005; Wertsch, 2002). As these summaries make clear, the variety of \nwork in this area offers up very different conceptualisations of what exactly \n\u2018memory\u2019 is and what kinds of human activities fall under its overly broad remit \n(see Brown, 2008). Nevertheless we can safely assert that a common thread \nwhich runs through them all is the notion that memory is not a passive faculty of \n7 \n \nrecording and storing the past (a \u2018reproductive\u2019 notion of memory) but is rather an \nactive process in which persons engage to make sense of their own personal \nand collective histories (a \u2018reconstructive\u2019 notion of memory). The person as an \nactor, rather than mere recipient of social context and structure is a central \norganising principle here (Chamberlayne et al, 2000). Our own approach has \nstrong sympathies with the latter notion. \n \nFrom memory studies we draw two major themes which we find useful for \napproaching recollections of child sexual abuse. First of all, that past abuse is not \nsimply \u2018given\u2019 to memory, but is rather subject to continuous reflection and \n(re)interpretation by adult survivors (Haaken, 1998; Ronai, 1995). This \ninterpretative process is inflected by the cultural resources which are available to \nsurvivors at any given time. One major extant resource in Western Europe and \nNorth America is the readily available \u2018psycho-therapeutic\u2019 language that \nreformulates previous experiences of abuse into fairly set categories \n(victim\/survivor) (Kahn & Mathie, 2000). Some commentators have pointed to the \noverly prescriptive role that such a language can serve in the reorganisation of \nprior experiences of abuse, since it tends to efface the specificities of such \nmemories in favour of a dominant interpretative repertoire (O\u2019Dell, 2003; Reavey, \n2003). \n \nThe second theme is that memories are never really settled, in the sense of \nbeing \u2018finished off\u2019 or \u2018completed\u2019 in some sense. Rather there are elements of \nambiguity and indeterminacy which persist throughout all attempts to recollect \nprior experiences (Middleton & Brown, 2005). For example, Haaken (1998) \npoints to how some experiences of abuse can be layered with examples of both \npleasure (emotional warmth) as well as pain, as well as feelings of love and hate \ntowards an abuser. Ambivalence relating to the intention of the abuser, as well as \ntheir own \u2018participation\u2019 in the abuse is present in many memories of child sexual \nabuse, especially when the child is otherwise attached to the person abusing. In \nSylvia Fraser\u2019s \u2018classic\u2019 autobiography of incest, she speaks of the enormous \n8 \n \nconfusion she felt for a man who inhabited multiple contradictory roles in her \nimagination, as a loving father and wilful rapist.  \n \nIf the first theme directs us towards the role of well embedded cultural narratives \nin making sense of experiences of abuse, then the second turns us back towards \nthe dilemmas and ambiguities in interpretation which the adult survivor faces. \nThere are parallels here with semiotic approach to disclosures of child sexual \nabuse adopted by Jensen (2005), where abuse becomes a contested \u2018sign\u2019 to be \ndeciphered in the present. As Molina & del Rio (2007) argue in their perceptive \ncommentary on this work, the dominance of a particular interpretative framework \nshould not blind us to the presence of ambiguity in situated acts of interpretation, \nnor to the notion that such ambiguity may serve a productive role in that opens \nthe way for further elaboration of meaning.  \n \nWhat is at stake here is grasping how a present sense of agency is formulated \nand reformulated by adult women survivors when confronted with the \ninterpretative dilemmas of recollected past abuse. To do so we need to \nunderstand how individual memories enter into continuous dialogue with \nculturally available stories which act to anchor recollections of abuse. This is a \nprocess Janice Haaken (1998) refers to as \u2018transformative remembering\u2019. \nHaaken demonstrates how the meaning of abuse is altered in the course of \ntelling and re-telling. When a memory of abuse is recalled, it has the potential to \ntransform wider cultural issues and more \u2018banal\u2019 female grievances (e.g. neglect \nor emotional abuse) into a primary narrative of enlightenment (\u2018I\u2019ve been \nabused\u2019) that can serve to explain and recuperate all of the \u2018undesirable\u2019 feelings \nthat women may have into one overarching narrative of violation (Reavey & \nBrown, 2006). In doing so individual experience becomes fused with the social \ninfluences that run through the fabric of memory, as well as the cultural \nconstructions of femininity and the emotional power of the immediate context in \nthe telling of that memory (the power of the juridical context, for example). \n9 \n \nPersonal memory and autobiography are thus inseparable from the historical, \nsocial and cultural conditions of its use (Rasmussen, 2002). \n \nInterdependencies in remembering \nAttending to the ways in which historicity enters into personal and collective \nmemory has been a central concern for socio-cultural studies of \u2018mind\u2019 (Vygotsky, \n1978).  The interdependency of the collective and individual, the public and \nprivate, for example, all work to establish how people position themselves in \nmemory, and what is rendered meaningful and significant, at a personal and \npublic level.  What constitutes a \u2018public\u2019 or \u2018private\u2019 issue, and where we posit \nourselves in relation to this as moral and \u2018mindful\u2019 agents, is in part defined by \nthe boundaries established by a collective (historical) consciousness (Duncan, \n1996). This is particularly important in discussing matters of child sexual abuse, \nas one of the key ways in which women feel blameworthy or shameful is in the \nsecretive and private manner in which the abusive relationship occurred (Warner, \n2000; Baker, 2002). A most important step towards addressing such emotions \nhas thus been to transform \u2018psychological\u2019 issues and \u2018private\u2019 ruminations into \nmatters of public concern and debate in feminist approaches (Brownmiller, 1978; \nKelly, 1988; Kitzinger, 1992; Armstrong, 1994). \n \nParticipation in a particular community, thus, entails awareness of the history \nshaping that community and an individual\u2019s memory of it (Middleton, 2002; \nMiddleton & Brown, 2005). As well as the importance of historical consciousness, \ninteractional exchanges, (embedded in both intimate and collective \nrelationships), collective memory and group membership all cede personal \ninterpretations of the link between past and present. If we take seriously social \nremembering approaches to memory, it is necessary to account for the various \ninterdependencies structuring these social processes (Brockmeier, 2002). By \ninterdependencies, Brockmeier is referring to the impossibility of thinking about \n\u2018personal memory\u2019 without consideration of the socio-cultural processes and \nsymbolic resources that mould it. \n10 \n \n \nTwo aspects regarding interdependency, in particular, stand out in relation to \nmatters of agency in memory, which we will address in the analysis section in \nmore detail. The first involves how individuals take account of whether their past \nexperiences involve an \u2018incidence\u2019 or an \u2018intention\u2019 in the discursive and rhetorical \norganisation of text (see Middleton, 2002). An incidence refers to an event that \noccurs outside of intentional awareness, whereas intention refers to an event that \nis motivated and agentic. Here we are concerned with how certain memories are \nconsidered to be incidental features of action, or intentional, as they serve to \norient the individual towards an understanding of themselves (personal), and \ntheir standing in relation to others (collective). The person thus exists in parallel \nwith collective concerns regarding moral responsibility and identity. If a past \nepisode is constituted as \u2018intentional\u2019, for example, specific issues relating to \nmoral actions in the future are more likely to be salient. This is precisely the \ndilemma that many women who have experienced abuse face, as the intentional \nstatus of memory can continue to project into past and future questions over \nresponsibility, agency and identity.  \n \nSecondly, we ask whether this \u2018orientation\u2019 is conventionalised via discursive \nsocial practices only (discourse, conversational exchanges or story-telling \npractices). That is, whether the agentic aspects of what happened then and what \nit is to recollect them now are organised exclusively through the various historical \ngrounded narrative and rhetoric devices available to adult women survivors. Is \ndiscourse sufficient? If it were this would suggest that ambiguities around \nrecollection could be resolved by drawing on the appropriate discursive \nresources (e.g. a discourse of early victimhood), or, alternatively that ambiguity is \na structural feature of the discourses in which child sexual abuse can be \nnarrated. Neither alternative is in fact the case. We have found that our \nparticipants recollections do not straightforwardly fit into a single \u2018master \nnarrative\u2019. Ambiguities persist around the nature, meaning and present relevance \nof what was experienced (although it is important to emphasise not around the \n11 \n \ndetails of what actually happened). Furthermore such ambiguities are troubling \nand difficult to manage for participants. They are not rhetorical aspects of some \ndiscourse but rather refer to precisely those things which are difficult to clearly \nsituate into a clear narrative understanding.  \n \nWomen seemingly have little to gain by invoking ambiguity and indeterminacy in \ntheir recollections of child sexual abuse. It does not apparently assist with \ncreating either personal or collective cohesion in relation to a remembered past \n(i.e. my own abusive history, my place in women\u2019s historical role as victims). Our \nargument is that it is precisely by disrupting such interdependencies, by keeping \nopen questions of individual and collective identity, that women are able to \ndemonstrate agency in the present. This is done by raising questions of their own \nand others agency and participation in the past with respect to the abuse (see \nReavey & Brown, 2006; 2007). Clearly to even begin to articulate such \nambivalence is profoundly threatening, since it carries the risk of being treated as \nan unreliable rememberer or of been seen to be identifying with the abuse or \nabuser(s). Ambiguity must then itself be managed. If it is not resolved through \nnarrative means then how is this done? \n \nMediation and memory: human and non-human participation \nEdward Casey (1987), in a phenomenological study of autobiographical memory \nhas proposed that \u2018personal memories\u2019 are firmly embedded within the material \nspaces that we inhabit with other people \u2013 in private homes as well as public \nenvironments. Places or settings are not regarded as empty spaces where \nmemories become placed; settings contain a \u2018peopled\u2019 past, occupied by sets of \nrelationships, where particular social practices are performed, including rituals, \nhabits and\/or official procedures (Geertz, 1973; Casey, 1987). Following Wertsch \n(2002) we may then treat remembering as a form of \u2018mediated action\u2019 \u2013 that is, a \nform of human action that makes use of \u2018cultural tools\u2019 (including features of the \nmaterial environment) to accomplish recognisably psychological ends (i.e. \nrecollection of the past). Wertsch\u2019s approach to remembering restates the \n12 \n \nVygotksian position that mediation results in the \u2018objectification\u2019 of human action, \nas particular mind activities (e.g. thought) can become reconfigured and \nobjectified through material activity (e.g. writing) (van der Veer & Valsiner, 1991; \nCole, 2003). Ambiguity may then emerge in the process of such objectification \nand in particular as a consequence of what Wertsch calls the \u2018irreducible tension\u2019 \nbetween actor and cultural tool during recollection (2002: 11-12) \n \nWe wish, however, to extend this definition of mediated action to include not only \nthe cultural tools which are available to actors in their current setting as they \nengage in recollection, but also the artefacts which were part of the episodes of \nabuse which are being recollected. In order to bring these artefacts into our \nanalysis we will have to shift towards a slightly different sense of mediation, as it \nappears in the work of Bruno Latour (2005) and Actor-Network Theory (e.g. \nCallon, 1991; Law, 2002). If Wertsch\u2019s concept of mediated action is informed by \nVygotsky and the Soviet philosophical tradition, then Latour\u2019s use of the term, \nwhilst kindred in spirit, is simultaneously informed by the work of Michel Serres \n(1982; 1991), the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead (1985; 2004) and the \n\u2018material semiotics\u2019 of AJ Greimas (1983; 1985). \n \nFrom Serres, Latour and Callon derive the idea that social relations are \nthoroughly intertwined with objects and the material surfaces of the world. Serres \n(1995) rejects the notion that social relations have some intersubjective \n\u2018contractual\u2019 basis, emphasising instead that: \n \nOur relationships, social bonds, would be as airy as clouds were there \nonly contracts between subjects. In fact, the object, specific to Hominidae, \nstabilizes our relationships, it slows down the time of our revolutions. For \nan unstable band of baboons, social changes are flaring up every minute. \nOne could characterize their history as unbound, insanely so. The object, \nfor us, makes our history slow. (Michel Serres, 1982b\/1995: 87) \n \n13 \n \nFor Serres, it is paradoxically the case that there is nothing intrinsically \u2018social\u2019 to \nsocial relations. Rather he sees what we call \u2018the social\u2019 as emerging from \nnetworks of relations between humans and things. These networked relations \nallow a transfer of properties and capacities \u2013 for example, physical barriers and \nwritten signs can replace the need to continuous monitor and instruct the \nbehaviour of others \u2013 a process which Serres calls \u2018translation\u2019 (see Brown, \n2002). The translation process is what creates the matrix of various forms of \nhuman action. Hence Latour sometimes refers to the \u2018interobjective\u2019 basis of \nhuman action (see Latour 1996 and the commentary by Engestrom, 1996 for a \ngood illustration of the contrasting uses of \u2018mediation\u2019). \n \nAN Whitehead (1985) provides the key idea that the ascription of identity to a \ngiven thing is a higher order process that synthesises or aggregates an assembly \nof relations. For example, a \u2018community\u2019 is in fact a nexus of relationships \nevolving over and changing over time, and similarly what we call \u2018electricity\u2019 is an \nongoing flow of positively and negatively charged electrons. The point of this \nobservation is that if identity is something ascribed secondarily rather than given \nin reality then it is erroneous to see action as issuing from identity \u2013 rather there \nis an ongoing process of activity for which identity is a kind of shorthand \ndescription. Latour (1996) uses this notion to assert that the proper unit of \nanalysis is the assembly of relations. However, unlike Wertsch, he refuses to \ndistinguish between what is tool and what is actor in this assembly. \n \nFinally, AJ Greimas, the central figure in the so-called \u2018Paris school\u2019 of semiotics, \nprovides the notion that there is a \u2018generative grammar\u2019 of relations out of which \nall possible signs are derived. Akrich & Latour (1992) argue that if these relations \nare understood not as basic meaning units, as semiotics is usually taken to \nimply, but rather as sets of relational propensities, or ways in which one actor \nmay potentially figure or become relevant for another actor, then Greimasian \nsemiotics can be applied equally to animals, machines or environmental relations \n(see Greimas, 1985). In all cases, they propose, what needs to be analysed is \n14 \n \nhow the actions of one actor become hooked into and mediated by the entire \nnetwork of others which define a given setting: \n \nSemiotics: The study of how meaning is built, but the word \"meaning\" is \ntaken in its original nontextual and nonlinguistic interpretation; how one \nprivileged trajectory is built, out of an indefinite number of possibilities; in \nthat sense, semiotics is the study of order building or path building and \nmay be applied to settings, machines, bodies, and programming language \nas well as texts ... the key aspect of the semiotics of machines is its ability \nto move from signs to things and back. (Akrich & Latour, 1992: 259) \n \nThe key features of a Latourian approach to mediation are therefore that it \nconcerns the intertwining of human and non-human relations; that it focuses on \nthe literal material associations and the ways these are arranged and \u2018summed \nup\u2019 in a given assembly; and that it seeks to analyse how actors (non-human as \nwell as human) intervene in and mediate one another\u2019s affairs through their \nrelational propensities. \n \nApplied to memory, this approach suggests that objects and artefacts lend \nsomething of their seeming stability and potential anchorage in recall. That is to \nsay that recollected events may be inflected not only by the social relations that \nstructure the events, but also by the artefactual or non-human relations present \nin the setting being recalled. What is recalled is not the behaviour of persons set \nagainst some neutral backdrop, but rather an action-complex involving an \nassembly of relations between people and things. The relational propensities of \nartefacts may then become embedded in our recollections. Or, put slightly \ndifferently, the assembly of relations extends in time as well as space. In \nrecollection the artefacts which participated in the relations being recalled may \nnot literally be present, but their propensities are concretely felt with respect to \nthe \u2018privileged trajectories\u2019 they have constrained and afforded.   \n15 \n \nMiddleton & Brown (2005), for example, drawing on Callon (1991), describe how \nrecollections may be \u2018punctualised\u2019 or drawn together around a particular object. \nA recollection of the moral character of past times and people, for instance, may \nproceed through a description of the home-made clothes worn at the time (see \nMiddleton & Brown, 2005: chapter 8). The propensity of objects, how they lend \nthemselves to a collective sense of self-sufficiency, domestic order and moral \nworth, can and does make a difference to how this past comes to matter in the \npresent. This is not to say that objects somehow determine memory, rather that \nthe way they \u2018authorise, allow, afford, encourage, permit, suggest, influence, \nblock, render possible [and] forbid\u2019 particular actions has concrete resonance in \nrecollection (Latour, 2005: 72). Memory must go by way of the objects. \n \nOur argument here is that ambiguity in adult women\u2019s recollections of child \nsexual abuse involves addressing questions of incidence and intention. These \nquestions coalesce around and are punctualised by objects. For example, a door \nwhich is closed and locked raises the question of whether what follows was \nintentionally constituted as \u2018private\u2019 or \u2018secretive\u2019 (see Hall, 1996; Duncan, 1996). \nThe material features of the settings which afford the possibility of child sexual \nabuse (often in the habitual privatisation of the home or some other protected \ninstitution) can become the focus of recollection. They allow ambiguity to be both \nposed \u2013 what does it mean that he locked the door? why did I let him come into \nmy room? \u2013 and to be disposed \u2013 he locked it so no-one would know; he violated \nmy private space. In this way ambiguity is both raised and managed in \nrecollection by focussing on how the dispositions of things contribute to the \nrecollected episodes (e.g. doors can make a private space or they can keep \nother people from knowing what happens \u2013 I have come to believe he intended \nthe latter to be the case). \n \nWe will now illustrate our argument by describing four examples. These are \ntaken from ten semi-structured interviews with women who have experienced \nsexual abuse as children. Seven of the women were white, two black and two \n16 \n \nmixed race and six were university educated. Two were self-defined as bisexual, \ntwo as lesbian and six as heterosexual (see Reavey, 1998 for further details). \nOur analysis is theoretically driven, in the sense that we wish to build our \nargument by way of these examples. However, the point of departure for the \nargument initially came through the inductive observation that all of the specific \nmemories the participants reported in the interviews conducted contained \nreference to specific places and artefacts. The examples we present here are \ngood exemplars of what is found throughout the data corpus. \n \nAnalysis \nIn all of the examples below, recollections of specific events contain reference to \nambivalence, in terms of the abuser\u2019s or, in examples one and three, the \nwoman\u2019s own agency and seeming \u2018participation\u2019 as a child at the time. All of the \nwomen are, of course, aware that as children their agency was thoroughly \ncompromised by the actions of the abuser. Yet despite this awareness, the terms \nof the relationships between themselves and their abuser appear difficult for \nthem to definitively interpret (often demanded by the archetypal victim\/abuser \nplot in culturally available discourses). It is then striking that physical spaces and \nobjects are invoked to pose ambivalence around incidence and intention and to \nsubsequently stabilise it in some way.  \n \nIn the first example, it is clear that there are a number of alternative open to the \nspeaker about her brother\u2019s putative intentions and how they may or may not \nhave resulted in the abuse. What is particularly noteworthy is the manner in \nwhich the material mediators (writing and the door) both make it possible to raise \nthe issue of ambiguity surrounding the events (as aspects of pleasure creep in) \nwhilst they ultimately enable an attribution of intentionality to the abusive actor. \n \n17 \n \n \n \nExample one \n \nIt was my brother, we I would think that when he started, it was , er \ncuriosity, but I think, erm\u2026one thing I tried convincing myself of, that that \nhe was na\u00efve and he didn\u2019t know what he was doing was wrong, but he \nused to lock the door to to, we didn\u2019t have key locks, he used to take the \nhandle and take out the bar.  \n \n[later in the interview] \n \nI\u2019d say the main problem there is is, the guilt for enjoying what he did, and \nthat can really tear me up sometimes, and I think that\u2019s been, big problem, \nactually specifically before I realised the the feeling of confusion, and what \nI should feel about enjoying this. \n \nI do feel guilty about writing it down, cos it makes it solid, it makes it er, it\u2019s \nevidence and it\u2019s just\u2026like I say, it makes it, it makes it real, which of \ncourse it was, but some of me wonders how much of it as real\u2026but \nthere\u2019s a big part of you that wants to be believe he didn\u2019t know what he \nwas doing, but I don\u2019t think I can convince myself of that, like I say, going \nto the extent of locking the door\u2026by the time he got to fifteen, he must \nhave known, he must have done\u2026I think so\u2026but it would have been nice \nif he didn\u2019t. \n \nWould it make a difference? \n \nYeah because of the way I feel about him, because\u2026because if it was \nbasic curiosity, if if, and, rather than actually knowing that it was \n18 \n \nwrong\u2026he must have known how it would affect me. (Interview three, \nLorna; 28 year old white heterosexual woman) \n \nThe act of abuse clearly still holds some ambivalence for Lorna. The memory \ncontains a mixture of emotions and sensations (e.g. pleasure, confusion), as well \nas a set of dilemmas around how to name her experiences as abusive. What is \nat stake in this passage is the constitution of Lorna\u2019s experiences as incidences \n(of curiosity) or malicious intentional acts carried out by her brother. If the latter \ncan be established, then the \u2018effects\u2019 of these acts can be more readily \nunderstood and the identity of Lorna as a survivor more secure. Furthermore, it is \nthe intentional awareness of her brother that is also at stake in the setting up of \nLorna\u2019s agency \u2013 there is interdependency between his and her agency. If his \nintentions were to do with mere \u2018curiosity\u2019 then it is more likely that her own \n\u2018curiosity\u2019 would be called into question. Thus, of interest here are the moves \nmade towards managing such emotional ambivalences in the recollection. If \nambivalence can be displaced, a more \u2018solid\u2019 ground for trusting that the abuse \nwas real and harmful can be more fully accepted. \n \nThe propensities of the door clearly play a key role in the constitution of agency \nin this recollection. Locks on doors \u2018close\u2019 rooms against uninvited visitors and \ndelineate between public and private spaces. They also lend themselves to \nestablishing an order of things, in terms of the sexual relations that were to take \nplace behind those closed doors. The intentions of the actor become translated \nand stabilised in relation to the door itself. The person who holds the key is the \nrecognisable character who is in charge of the situation. Thus, we are able to say \nthat the stability of the victim\/perpetrator binary is produced through the \nparticipation of the objects (key, lock, door) which make up the setting. The \nintentions of persons are worked out relationally through the contribution of the \npropensities of things. Objects are called upon to fix, or make stable, the \ndynamics of the situation being remembered. \n \n19 \n \nThe locking of the door is then taken to be a clear sign of the intended malice \nbehind the act, which subsequently lends weight to the attribution that he must \nthen have been knowingly damaging her sense of self. As Lorna opines:  \n \nit makes it, it makes it real, which of course it was, but some of me \nwonders how much of it as real\u2026but there\u2019s a big part of you that wants to \nbe believe he didn\u2019t know what he was doing, but I don\u2019t think I can \nconvince myself of that, like I say, going to the extent of locking the \ndoor\u2026by the time he got to fifteen, he must have known, he must have \ndone. \n \nThe judgement of his sexual agency is not based on the exercise of his sexual \ndesire per se (because curiosity would have been more acceptable), it is directed \nat his ability to forfeit that desire to protect his sister. The brother\u2019s agency thus \nfeeds into her own, with the matter settled by the locking of the door. Objects \nserve here to settle things in the moment and allow Lorna to proceed with a \ncausal narrative of damage. The intention involved in taking off the lock \ndemonstrates to Lorna that ambivalence over her brother\u2019s agency can be \nprovisionally placed to one side making it possible for future attributions (by her \nand others) concerning her wiling participation in this event to be displaced.  \n \nExample two \n \nAnd what he did was locked me in the bedroom, didn\u2019t give me anything to \neat, until I basically gave in, or I was a good girl, in his terms\u2026we\u2026and \nthat was really frightening, and the memory I had, but he took all the \nbedding and all the clothes out of the room\u2026and I remember, the chest of \ndrawers looked like a monster because the drawers weren\u2019t there, it\u2019d got \nthis mouth, which was strange. \n(Interview four, Theresa, 40 year old white lesbian) \n \n20 \n \n \nIn this extract the relationship between the father and child is marked out and \nstabilised by the act of locking the door, removing the clothes and drawers and \nleaving the child alone in a familiar place, altered through the violation of familiar \nobjects (e.g. the monstrous wardrobe). The space of a child\u2019s room is replete \nwith references to the familial ordering in a house (Duncan, 1996). Being sent to \none\u2019s room as a child is an established way for particular moral lessons to be \nlearnt, including learning how to follow a particular parental rule.  However, one\u2019s \nroom can also be a way to engage with one\u2019s desires as a child. The comfort and \nprivate space of one\u2019s room can afford an engagement with agency, without \nparental intervention or interruption.  \n \nThis is clearly not the case for the child Theresa is describing in the extract. The \nchild\u2019s space has been usurped by the father who has removed all traces of \ncomfort from her familiar surroundings. The once familiar objects representing \nsecurity have been removed as a way of substituting verbal interaction and \nnegotiation with static objects that more firmly represent what is at stake (her \nfreedom, human contact and comfort). This scenario is, we would suggest, most \nlikely a condensing of a number of abusive scenes over time (Reavey & Brown, \n2006). However, what is interesting is the way in which the wardrobe, as a \nmonster, has remained memorable for Theresa. It mediates the complex \nrelationship between her and her father, translating it into a more culturally \nrecognisable plot, involving the monstrous villain. Here, her father\u2019s monstrous \nbehaviour can be displaced onto the objects in the room, which punctualise a \nwhole complex of relations that Theresa has had to endure with her father, who \nis read by others, and by Theresa herself, as a kind and loving father. This scene \ncontaining the monster object which frightens and breaks the will of the child \ntranslates and objectifies the sense of a lack of agency that Theresa describes. \n \nWithout such material configurations, intentions and motivations, and thus \nagency, would have to be read into the father himself who would not potentially \n21 \n \nbe as monstrous or frightening, since Theresa experienced the father as both \nkind AND abusive. Ambivalence can then be translated into a concrete set of \nrelations by the punctualisation of recollection around the wardrobe. The objects \nstabilise the abuse as something as frightening as a monster, with the drawers \nestablishing a stark concrete reality of fear \u2013 something unfamiliar, blank and \nstatic. By being locked in the room, the child is forced to confront this fear, which \nfurther stabilises the relationship as someone controlled by her abuser.  \n \nExample three \n \nI can remember, having been crossed over the road by my \ngrandma, standing at the gates of this house, and thinking, I don\u2019t want to \ngo here, because I knew what was going to happen, but, and I also knew \nthat there was a playground, a but further down, and there were swings \nand things, which was also very exciting, and I, I can remember wondering \nwhether I could actually go the swings instead of going and seeing this \nman, and em, and em, I think that I\u2019ve always felt\u2026why didn\u2019t I make the \nchoice, and part of me knows that if I\u2019d gone to the swings my grandma \nwould have found out, one, she would have been extremely angry, and \nshe would have told my mum, and my mum would have been extremely \nangry, em, two, my grandma would have been terrified, if I wasn\u2019t where \nI\u2019d ought to have been .\u2026my therapist used to say there wasn\u2019t an option, \nbecause er,  I didn\u2019t have an option because I was a child\u2026but I can\u2019t \ncan\u2019t deal with that. (34 year old heterosexual white woman) \n \nThe concrete character of the spatial relations described here objectifies the \nmoral order and network of dilemmatics the child is faced with. It also spatialises \npleasures in relation to the following choice where; a) the child giving grandma a \nbreak by visiting a house where she will become the object of someone else\u2019s \npleasure; or b) the child engaging in her own pleasure by visiting the park but \nevoking anger and displeasure in others. \n22 \n \n \nThe \u2018road\u2019 in particular becomes a stable feature of this narrative in that it \ndramatises the inevitability of the choice \u2013 she has to cross the road because her \ngrandma has escorted her to that place. But in that crossing it is as if the \u2018choice\u2019 \nto be abused has been made, as it is also necessary to return again via this road, \nand if expectations have not been met (i.e. the child stays in the man\u2019s house) \nsevere consequences would have to be faced. The spatialisation of events, \nthrough the focus on objects, then makes for a visible and complex moral order. \nThe child may be seen to be acting responsibly towards others. She crosses the \nroad, and in so doing avoids upsetting people who matter. However the \nintroduction of the swings as her \u2018object\u2019 of pleasure, that she could have chosen \nto indulge in, reiterates her emphasis on the reality of the child\u2019s agency. She \nrefuses to take the line (as her therapist encourages her to do) that children are \nnot capable of choice and represents the reality of children\u2019s agentic capabilities \nand pleasures in the objects themselves. The working up of choice, then, through \nobjects is a significant feature of establishing coherence in retrospect. \n \nExample four \nI couldn\u2019t forfeit the important relationships in my life, just \nto stop this abuse happening, so it carried on for about a \nyear\u2026I mean I can remember one time we were sitting \non top of this wall, and he came out, and he lifted his \ndaughter down, sort of like you do with a child\u2026and he \nlifted me down, and he looked over his shoulder and he \nput his hand between my legs\u2026he didn\u2019t have to lift me \ndown like that. It was that that made me realise the \nlengths he would go to, I don\u2019t know why I put up with it \nand that\u2019s when it stopped. (Bella - 37 year old \nheterosexual white woman). \n \n23 \n \nIn example, four, it is again possible to see how agency \nconstitutes a key feature of Bella\u2019s memory. She is struggling to \nmake sense, throughout the interview, of why she \u2018allowed\u2019 the \nabuse to happen. Here, in this specific memory, she arrives at \nan explanation that she feels make sense. After describing her \nhome life as replete with neglect, she describes this particular \nspace with her friend positively, and with great fondness. \nThus, Bella\u2019s defiance and assertion of agency is captured by \nher \u2018put[ting] up with the abuse\u2019 and by refusing to give up the \nimportant relationships in her life. Her recollection is replete with \nambivalence precisely due to her defiance regarding the \npositive relationships in her life and her desire to preserving \nthem. It is interesting that the only clear incident she remembers \nin the interview involves a particular spatial configuration, \naround a wall. This occurred in the interview despite a protocol \nbeing in place where details regarding the scenes of abuse \nwere to be avoided.  \n \nOf interest here is the way in which her encounter with the \nabuser (her friend\u2019s father) is mediated by the wall. As the wall \nis high Bella must accept help from the abuser in question. Her \nstatus as a child, therefore, is reaffirmed by the height of the \nwall and her smaller physical scale. It also reaffirms her status \nand position as the child. The wall thus acts as the mediator \nwhich establishes the relation of adult provider to child in need \nof support. Her physical limitations (in being unable to get down \nfrom the wall) are thus brought to the fore, and thus her agency \nin the situation is also subject to questioning. The wall therefore \ncondenses and simplifies the dynamics of power into a more \nstraightforward reading of powerless child and more powerful \nadult. \n24 \n \nFurthermore, Bella is then able to make to situate the \nrecollected episode with respect to normative \u2018usual\u2019 \nrelationships where adults would respond to the need of the \nchild to be lifted off the wall; that is, with kindness, rather than \nabuse.  \n \nand he lifted his daughter down, sort of like you do with a \nchild\u2026and he lifted me down, and he looked over his \nshoulder and he put his hand between my legs\u2026he didn\u2019t \nhave to lift me down like that. It was that that made me \nrealise\u2026 \n \nIt is this particular point that the chasm between her relationship \nto the abuser and her friend\u2019s apparently \u2018normal\u2019 relationship to \nher father is rendered concrete. She appears struck by how \nadults can and \u2018ought\u2019 to behave and captures a glimpse of the \nabuser as a loving father who behaved in a protective manner \ntowards his own daughter. Her position as an abused child, \ntherefore, becomes visible through the wall as mediator. The \nwall is acting to distribute and make clear the position of each of \nthe actors within a set of relationships. Furthermore, the power \ndynamics are afforded stability through the child\u2019s relationship to \nthis concrete object and her inability to prevent the man in \ntaking this as an opportunity to abuse her. In her recollection, \nthe actions mediated by the wall are precisely the point at which \nshe becomes clear about the powerless position she finds \nherself in more generally. Not only this, in his \u2018looking around\u2019 to \nsee if anyone is watching when he performs this abusive act, a \na visible sign is provided to Bella that his act is indeed \nintentional, which in turn reaffirms his position as the knowing \nwrongdoer. Her assertion of will then shifts from the \n25 \n \npreservation of her relationship with her friend to stopping the \nabuse. \n \nConclusion \nIn this paper, we have argued that objects and spaces provide us with a further \nanalytic with which to make sense of the ways in which adult women manage \nissues of agency in relation to recollections of child sexual abuse. We have \nfocussed on adult women not because we believe that there are inherent gender \ndifferences with respect to remembering, but because women\u2019s testimony and \nstatus as rememberers confronts very particular cultural obstacles, which has \nsignificant issues for how questions of agency are worked out. Moreover, whilst \nour analysis has been theoretically led, we have also wished to confine ourselves \nto the specific empirical material we have available.  \n \nWith experiences as potentially complex as child sexual abuse, where \nambiguities are felt or anxieties over agency are constantly fought, objects allow \nambivalence to be both posed and potentially disposed. There is of course \nnothing inherent in any given object itself which proved decisive. The objects do \nnot determine the content of recollection \u2013 there is no \u2018essence\u2019 or fundamental \nproperty of a wardrobe which directly signify \u2018monster\u2019. But at the same time we \ndo not feel that this \u2018monstrousness\u2019 is purely the result of Theresa\u2019s own \nimaginative associations. We have been guided by a very particular (and not \nuncontroversial \u2013 see Lenoir, 1994) interpretation of semiotics which treats \npeople and things as participants in an assembly of relations, wherein properties \nand identities are mutually defined and exchanged (or \u2018translated\u2019). Such \nassemblies can be considered in terms of the possible trajectories of action and \ninvolvement they afford prior to questions of meaning and signification being \nposed. This sort of \u2018material semiotics\u2019 has gathered substantial ground for the \nmost part outside of psychology (e.g. Brown & Stenner, 2009; DeLanda, 2005; \nLatour, 2005; Law, 2004; Massumi, 2002; Mol, 2002; Rotman, 2007). \n \n26 \n \nWe feel this version of semiotics is worthwhile developing within psychological \napproaches to memory and agency because it has the potential to address some \nof the conceptual and practical problems which have arisen in the shift away from \n\u2018reproductive\u2019 to \u2018reconstructive\u2019 accounts of remembering. All too often, \nreconstructive approaches are taken to be supporting the unsustainable position \nthat matters of accuracy and literal recall are irrelevant. Persons are thereby \nsupposed to be able to say and claim what they like in relation to their own or \nsome collective past. This is most certainly not the case in recollections of child \nsexual abuse, where details of events can be clearly and literally recalled. But at \nthe same time, there are profound ambivalences within such recollections. We \nmust take into account the individual and social interdependencies in adult \nwomens recollections of child sex abuse (including cultural suspicions over \nwomens testimony), but also, critically, that such recollections are at once both \nliteral\/reproductive and imaginative\/reconstructive. \n \nOur way through this puzzle has been to argue that the spaces and objects in \nwhich abuse occurs serve as participants in prolonging events into the future. \nWalls, doors, wardrobes, keys all contribute to how the past can come to matter \nin the present. We have used the strange notion of a \u2018propensity\u2019 of things (see \nJullien, 1999). That is to say that a given artefact has a limited capacity or set of \naffordances which it can contribute to an assembly which subsequently \ncircumscribes the possibilities for recollection. In this way objects can punctualise \nand objectify ambivalent or indeterminate relations. In so doing they enable \nambiguity to be raised as an issue, whilst simultaneously lending something of \ntheir propensity to the human actors involved. In the course of recollection, the \nintentions of humans are, in a sense, borrowed from the propensities of things. If \nthis is so, then analysis of recollections of child sexual abuse needs to \nacknowledge spaces and things as integral to memory. The ambivalences and \ncertainties of recollections of abuse, anxieties, feelings of pleasure and pain \noccur in and through peopled spaces. It is their particular configuration which lies \n27 \n \nat the heart of the barely speakable memories which survivors are forced to \nrecall. \n \nReferences \nAkrich, M. & Latour, B.
