INTRODUCTION \nActive magnetic bearings (AMBs) have several \nadvantages over conventional bearings, and are being \nemployed increasingly in a variety Qf applications [l]. \nHowever, two difficulties concernkg magnetic bearing \ncontrol involve system uncertainties and the difficulty of \nobtaining a good velocity signal [2]. In this paper, a basic \nAMB comprising two opposing electromagnets and a rigid \nrotor, as shown in Fig. 1, is considered. To cope with \nsystem parameter uncertainties, an interval model is \nemployed. To avoid the use of a velocity feedback signal, \na dynamical compensator, which uses only positional \ninformation, is utilised for control. By deriving a stability \ncondition for the closed-loop system, a parameterisation of \nall the robust stabilising dynamical compensators for the \ninterval system is obtained. By appropriately selecting the \nfree parameters in the robust stabilizing controller, &e H, \nnorm of the transfer function from disturbance to output is \nmade arbitranly small over the system parameter intervals, \nand the H ,  norm of the controller transfer functiop is \nmade arbitrarily close to a lower bound. The prspased \napproach is applied to a high-speed flywheel suppooed by \ntwo active radial magnetic bearings and two passive axial \nmagnetic bearings. \nElectromagnet  I Electromagnet  2 Rotor \nFig.  I ,  Basic  magne l i c  bearing \n11. PLANT MODEL AND CONTROLLER \nThe dynamical mathematical model for the active \nmagnetic bearing shown in Fig. 1 can be established as: \nwhere m and q are, respectively, the mass (kg) and the \nposition displacement (m) of the rotor; qo is the nominal \nair gap (m); po = 471 x H\/m; A is the total pole-face \narea of each electromagnet (m\u2019); N is the number of turns \nper coil; Il ,I, are the currents in the coils (A); f is an \nunknown disturbance (N); and F is some known force \nacting on the rotor (N). When linearised at the equilibrium \npoint 1 = 12 = 10, 4 = 0, with the control diagram shown \nin Fig. 2, the above model (1) becomes \n(2a) \n1 ij - w 2 q  = GU +-(f+ F )  \nm \nwhere o and (3 are determined by I,, qo , and the system \nphysical parameters, and U is the derived control action. \nDue to inaccuracies in the measurement of some of the \nphysical parameters and changing environmental \nconditions, the parameters o and o are generally \nuncertain. Without loss of generality, however, it can be \nassumed that their values lie within some known intervals, \nViz. \nwhere 0 1, w 2, 01 and 0 2  are known scalars satisfying \n0 \u20ac 1 0 1  0 2 1 ,  o.Eo1 (321  (2b) \n0 2  201 >o, (31 sa2 < o  (2c) \nIf y is the measured value of q, then a general first-order \noutput dynamical compensator for system (2) can be \nwritten in the form [3]: \ni = k,,z + k,,y \nU = k l I y + k l 2 z + k f F  \n0-7803-5293-9\/99 $10.00 0 1999 IEEE 493 \nwhere k ,  , i, j = 1,2 , are four scalar controller coefficients, \nto be designed, and the coefficient k f  is given by \nIV. DISTURBANCE ATTENUATION \nThe disturbance attenuation specification can be \nexpressed as follows: \nDisturbance N' = sup llcrnc (31 - ~ m c  drnc 11: 5 8 0  (6) \nW@Ol 0 2 1  \nae[ol 0 2 1  \nwhere is an arbitrary positive number. \nMagnetic + Theorem 2: Let E~ be an arbitrary positive ,scalar, \nthen, the robust stabilizing dynamical compensator for the \ninterval system (2), given by (3) and (S), \n(i) guarantees the specification in (6) if the parameter a \nmagnet 2 \nis taken as \na =  ( 7 )  Fig. 2.

For robust stabilization of \nsystem (2) with the dynamical compensator (3), the \nfollowing result holds. \nwhere in (7)-(9), 8 is an arbitrary real scalar. \nV. MINIMUM CONTROL EFFORT \nThe controller given in (3) can be written, in the \nTheorem 1: All the robust stabilizing compensators in frequency domain, as follows: \nthe form of (3 ) ,  for system (2), are given by \nl k , ,  =-$-(a: + a )  s - k22 \n- 2  \nk22 = -P I kl, = Y In order to facilitate a small control effort, the following (sa) index is proposed: \nwith a, p ,  y and T being real scalars satisfying \na>O, P > O , y * O ,  O < . r < l  (543) \n494 \nwhich can be shown to have the greatest lower bound \n(12) 4 Jglb = - \n1.2 \nThe control effort specification can, therefore, be expressed Passive axial \nas magnetic beari \nSE, (13) \nkl1 \nkl2 \nk2 1 \nk22 \nk f \nwhere E, is an arbitrarily given positive scalar. \n256022 539200 \n10000 10000 \n-11 11 1 1  -250000 \n-5000 -5000 \n1.61088OE-2 1.6108808-2 \nTheorem 3: Let E,, and E, be two arbitrary positive \nscalars.

CONTROLLER COEFFICIENTS \nI Coefficients I Vertical I Horizontal I \nVI. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTS \nThe proposed approach has been applied to a flywheel \nenergy storage system which is being developed for use in \nurban electric vehicles. A schematic of the flywheel is \nshown in Fig.3. The flywheel rim is supported by two \nactive radial magnetic bearings, whose normal air gap is \nqo=0.4 mm, and two passive axial bearings. The active \nbearings have a homopolar topology, each electromagnet \ncomprising two abutting E-shaped cores. On the vertical \naxis, the pole-face area of each core is 10.4 x 10-4m2, whilst \non the horizontal axis the pole-face area is 5.2 x 10\u201cm2. \nEach core carries a coil having 40 turns. The mass of the \nflywheel rim is 12 kg. The upper bounds for the two \nparameters o and (5 in the linear model (2) for the two \nelectromagnets on the vertical axis were chosen to be \no =390 and o2 = -4.5 , while those for the electromagnets \non the horizontal axis were chosen to be o2 =280 and \no2 = -2 .  Based on these values and Theorem 3, robust \ncontrollers in the form of (3) for the electromagnets on \nboth the vertical and horizontal axes were obtained. The \nresulting coefficients are shown in Table 1. \nApplying controller (3), with the coefficients given in \nTable 1, to the non-linear system (1) yields the non-linear \nclosed-loop control system. Assuming m =6kg for both the \nvertical and horizontal axes, simulations of the non-linear \nclosed-loop systems for both axes were carried out, and \nsatisfactory results obtained. The controllers were then \nimplemented digitally on a TMS32OC40 DSP-based \n0 0 2  04 0 6  \nFig. 4 Initial energsation of flywheel bearing system \nVII. REFERENCES \n[l] M.
