Introduction\nA scalable solid-state quantum computer has to rely on a hybrid architecture which combines\nstatic and flying qubits [1]. Recent works propose the passage of electrons through mesoscopic\nscatterers for the generation of entanglement between flying qubits [2]\u2013[10], and charge\nmeasurements by an electrometer [11] have been proposed and realized to entangle or manipulate\nstatic spin and charge qubits [12]\u2013[16]. Hence, it seems natural to exploit mesoscopic interference\nand scattering to entangle flying qubits to static qubits [17].\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that prompt and perfect entanglement of a flying and a\nstatic charge qubit can be realized when a double quantum dot occupied by a tunnel charge\nis electrostatically coupled to the symmetric arms of an Aharonov\u2013Bohm interferometer (an\nAharonov\u2013Bohm double electrometer, see figure 1(b)). For anAharonov\u2013Bohm flux\u0001AB = h\/2e\n(half a flux quantum), each electron passing through the ring signals that the tunnel charge has\nchanged its quantum state, while each electron which is reflected signals that the tunnel charge has\nmaintained its state. This can be used to produce perfect entanglement between the static charge\nqubit represented by the tunnel charge in the double dot [18], and the flying qubit represented\nby the charge of the conduction electron in the exit leads [2]\u2013[10]. Since this entanglement\nmechanism does not require any energy fine tuning (for the implications of energy constraints\nsee [10]), the entanglement can be produced quickly by the passage of a single electronic wave\npacket through the system.\nOur proposal draws from both mesoscopic effects mentioned above \u2014in essence, it consists\nof two electrometers both coupling to the same charge qubit, and pinched together to form an\nAharonov\u2013Bohm ring, which then represents a mesoscopic scatterer. Since we require that the\ncoupling of the tunnel charge to the arms of the ring is symmetric, our proposal falls into the class\nof parity meters which have been discussed for the entanglement and detection of spin qubits\n[13, 14] and charge qubits [15]. In the present paper, we are concerned with charge degrees\nof freedom only, and the resulting entanglement should be detectable by current\u2013charge cross-\ncorrelation experiments [7, 8].\n2. Scattering theory\nIn order to describe the properties of the Aharonov\u2013Bohm double electrometer we start\nwith the scattering region which is depicted in figure 1(a). It consists of two quantum wire\nsegments labelled 1 and 2, which are symmetrically arranged around the double quantum\ndot. The tunnel charge in the double dot is described by a pseudospin, associated to states\n|\u2191\u3009 when the charge is in the upper dot and |\u2193\u3009 when the charge is in the lower dot. The\nground state is given by the symmetric combination |+\u3009 = 2\u22121\/2(|\u2191\u3009 + |\u2193\u3009), and the excited\nstate is |\u2212\u3009 = 2\u22121\/2(|\u2191\u3009 \u2212 |\u2193\u3009). Both states are separated by a tunnel splitting energy \u0002. The\norbital degree of freedom of the passing electron is described by basis states |1\u3009 and |2\u3009.\nVia its electrostatic repulsion potential V(x), the tunnel charge impedes the current in wire 1\nwhen it occupies the upper dot, while it impedes the current in wire 2 when it occupies the\nlower dot.\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 67 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n3 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n\u03a6AB\n1\n2\nV\nV\n\u2206 \u2206\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1.

Degree of entanglement\n3.1. Stationary concurrence\nThe scattering amplitudes of the extended scattering matrix (5) can now be used to assess how the\ntunnel charge on the double dot becomes entangled with the itinerant electron during its passage\nthrough the Aharonov\u2013Bohm double electrometer. In particular, they describe by which lead the\npassing electron exits and how this is correlated to the final state of the double dot. We assume\nthat the double dot is initially in the symmetric state |+\u3009 and hence uncorrelated to an arriving\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 67 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n5 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nelectron that enters the ring from the left lead. The degree of entanglement between the final state\nof the double dot and the exit lead of the electron can then be quantified by the concurrence [21]\nC = 2|r++t\u2212+ \u2212 r\u2212+t++|, (7)\nwhich provides a monotonous measure of entanglement (C = 0 for unentangled states and C = 1\nfor maximal entanglement).\nFor the case of a vanishing flux \u0001AB = 0, the mixing angle is \u03c6 = 0. It then follows from\nequation (6) that the scattering matrix is of the form\nS =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nr++ 0 t\u2032++ 0\n0 r\u2212\u2212 0 t\u2032\u2212\u2212\nt++ 0 r\u2032++ 0\n0 t\u2212\u2212 0 r\u2032\u2212\u2212\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (8)\nIn this case the electron can only leave the system when the pseudospin of the scatterer has\nflipped an even number of times, hence the final state of the scatterer is identical to its initial\nstate. There is no entanglement, and consequently the concurrence (7) vanishes, C = 0.\nFor \u0001AB = h\/2e, the mixing angle is \u03c6 = \u03c0\/2, and the scattering matrix is of the form\nS =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nr++ 0 0 t\u2032+\u2212\n0 r\u2212\u2212 t\u2032\u2212+ 0\n0 t+\u2212 r\u2032++ 0\nt\u2212+ 0 0 r\u2032\u2212\u2212\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (9)\nNow the electron becomes entangled with the double dot: the electron is reflected when the\ndouble dot is finally in its symmetric state (the pseudospin of the double dot has then flipped\nan even number of times), while the electron is transmitted when the double dot is finally in its\nantisymmetric state (it then has flipped an odd number of times). The concurrence C = 2|r++t\u2212+|\nsignals perfect entanglement, C = 1, when the probabilities of reflection and transmission are\nidentical, |r++|2 = |t\u2212+|2 = 1\/2. The condition for perfect entanglement corresponds to the case\nof maximal shot noise [7, 8].\nThe entanglement in the Aharonov\u2013Bohm double electrometer results because the total\nparity \u03c3\u03c4 is conserved in the scattering from the double quantum dot. This conservation law\nyields the separate equations (3) and (4), which only couple wave components of the same total\nparity. Since the scattering matrix S\u02dc for positive and negative total parity is identical, this realizes\na parity meter which entangles the orbital parity of the passing electron to the pseudospin parity\nof the double dot. The role of the Aharonov\u2013Bohm ring with flux \u0001 = h\/2e is to convert the\norbital parity into charge separation in the exit leads. When the electron enters the ring at the\nleft contact, this prepares it locally in the orbitally symmetric state. Neglecting the scattering\nfrom the double dot, the electron cannot leave at the right contact since it will end up there in the\nantisymmetric orbital state. Transmission is therefore only possible if the orbital parity is flipped\nby interaction with the tunnel charge. But since the total parity is preserved, this scattering event\nis necessarily accompanied by a parity change of the double dot. Consequently, the final state\nof the tunnel charge is perfectly correlated to the lead by which the passing electron leaves the\nAharonov\u2013Bohm double electrometer.\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 67 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n6 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n3.2. Time-dependent concurrence\nThe energy-dependent scattering matrix (5) and the expression (7) for the concurrence describe\nthe stationary transport through the system. A pressing issue for many proposals involving flying\nqubits is that they require an energy fine tuning which entails a degrading of the entanglement\nin the time domain [10]. As we will now show, the entanglement can in fact be increased above\nthe value of the stationary concurrence when a single electronic wave packet is passed through\nthe Aharonov\u2013Bohm electrometer with \u0001AB = h\/2e.\nIn this non-stationary situation, the entanglement is quantified by the time-dependent\nconcurrence\nC(t) = 2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u3008\u03c8+|\u03c8+\u3009\u3008\u03c8\u2212|\u03c8\u2212\u3009 \u2212 |\u3008\u03c8+|\u03c8\u2212\u3009|2\n\u2223\u2223\u22231\/2, (10)\nwhere \u03c8+ and \u03c8\u2212 are the orbital wavefunctions obtained by projection onto the symmetric and\nanti-symmetric state of the double dot, respectively. The potential for entanglement enhancement\nfollows from the lower bound\nC(t) > Cmin(t) = 2\n\u221a\nPL(t)PR(t) \u2212 (1\/4)P0(t)2 (11)\nof the time-dependent concurrence, which can be derived directly from the form (9) of the\nscattering matrix when one assumes that the wave packet has completely entered the ring. Here,\nPL(t) is the weight of the reflected wave packet, PR(t) is the weight of the transmitted wave\npacket, and P0(t) = 1 \u2212 PL(t) \u2212 PR(t) is the weight of the wave packet in the ring. For large\ntimes P0(t = \u221e) = 0, and the weights PL(t = \u221e) = R and PR(t = \u221e) = T give the reflection\nand transmission probabilities of the wave packet, which can be obtained by an energy average\nover the wave packet components. For the case that this energy average yields equal reflection\nand transmission probabilities R = T = 1\/2, the final value of the concurrence after passage of\nthe electron is C(t = \u221e) = 1. In this case, maximal entanglement results during the passage\nof the electron through the system\u2014independent of the precise dependence of the stationary\nconcurrence in the energetic range of the wave packet. This entanglement enhancement is only\npossible because the scattering matrix S retains its sparse structure (9) for all energies.\nTo give a specific example, we consider the case that the tunnelling charge induces a localized\nscattering potential V = h\u00af22mg\u03b4(x) in the quantum wire. This problem can be solved exactly for\narbitrary values of the tunnel splitting \u0002, scattering strength g, and ring parameters ds and \u03b1s,\nusing the technique of [19]. Here, we concentrate on the case of a vanishing tunnel splitting\n\u0002 = 0, strong scattering g \u2192 \u221e, transparent contacts with \u03b1R = \u03b1L = 0, and equal distance\ndL = dR \u2261 d of the double dot to the contacts.

Time-dependent concurrence when an electronic wave packet passes\nthrough the ring with Aharonov\u2013Bohm flux \u0001AB = h\/2e, while the double\nquantum dot is initially in its symmetric state. The scattering potential is V =\nh\u00af2\n2mg\u03b4(x) with g \u2192 \u221e. The contacts to the ring are transparent, \u03b1R = \u03b1L = 0. The\ndistance dL = dR \u2261 d of the double dot to the contacts is d = 125 a, where a is the\nlattice constant. Time is measured in units of the average time of flight tD = 2d\/\u3008v\u3009\nof the wave packet between the two contacts. The centre of the initial wave packet\nin the lead is at a distance of 2000 a to the ring. The initial widthsw and the average\nwavenumbers \u3008k\u3009 are: w = 0.2d, \u3008k\u3009d = 4\u03c0 (solid curve), w = 2d, \u3008k\u3009d = 4\u03c0\n(dashed curve), w = 2d, \u3008k\u3009d = 4.125\u03c0 (dotted curve), w = 2d, \u3008k\u3009d = 4.25\u03c0\n(dashed-dotted curve).\nAt fixed energy, the stationary concurrence (7) is given by C = | sin \u03c6 sin 2kd|, and\nthe maximal stationary concurrence C = | sin 2kd| is attained at \u03c6 = \u03c0\/2, corresponding to\n\u0001AB = h\/2e. The factor | sin 2kd| arises from the energy dependence of the reflection probability\nR = cos2 kd. For a narrow wave packet, the reflection and transmission probabilities average\nto 1\/2, and the time-dependent concurrence approaches the maximal value C(t = \u221e) = 1 for\nlarge times.\nIn order to assess the time scale on which the entangled state is formed we have performed\nnumerical simulations which are presented in figure 2. The wave packet was propagated by a\nsecond-order Crank\u2013Nicholson scheme, and theAharonov\u2013Bohm ring and the leads were formed\nby tight-binding chains at wavelengths much larger than the lattice constant. For a narrow wave\npacket, the simulations confirm that the final state is perfectly entangled. For broader wave\npackets, the final entanglement is not necessarily perfect and depends on the average wave\nnumber, but is always attained on a time scale comparable to the propagation time of the wave\npacket between the contacts in the ring.\nIn figure 3, we assess how the degree of entanglement for a narrow wave packet depends on\nthe scattering strength g. Perfect entanglement is obtained for g \u0001 0.1, hence, already for rather\nweak coupling. For smaller g, the entanglement produced by a single passage of the wave packet\nis reduced. As required, the entanglement vanishes altogether in the limit g \u2192 0. For small but\nfinite g, one should expect that the entanglement can be enhanced by multiple passage of the\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 67 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n8 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\n 0.0\n 0.5\n 1.0\n \n0  5  10  15  20\nC\n(t)\nt\/tD\nFigure 3.

Sensitivity to decoherence and asymmetries\nThe time-dependent scattering analysis of the entanglement mechanism reveals an important\nand rather unique feature of the proposed device: As the entanglement can be generated in a\nsingle quasi-instantaneous scattering event, the proposed mechanism is rather robust against\ndecoherence from time-dependent fluctuations of the environment (decoherence, however, will\nalways become important in the subsequent dynamics of the system [1]). The main source of\nentanglement degradation hence comes from imperfections in the fabrication of the device itself,\nand here especially from imperfections which break the parity symmetry of the set-up. Arguably\nthe most critical part of the set-up is the requirement of symmetric coupling to the double dot,\nas other asymmetries (in the arm length and contacts to the external wires) are just of the same\ncharacter as in the conventional Aharanov\u2013Bohm effect and can be partially compensated, e.g.,\nvia off-setting the magnetic flux. The sensitivity to asymmetries in this coupling is explored in\nfigure 5, where the coupling strength to one arm is fixed to g = 0.1 while in the other arm the\nstrength is reduced by a factor \u03b1. Astonishingly, a rather large degree of entanglement remains\neven for much reduced \u03b1, which indicates that the proposed mechanism is rather more robust to\nasymmetries than it could have been expected.\n4. Discussion and conclusions\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that a tunnel charge on a double quantum dot can\nbe entangled to an individual electron which passes through an Aharonov\u2013Bohm ring with\nflux \u0001AB = h\/2e. Ideal operation requires symmetric electrostatic coupling of the tunnel\ncharge to the two arms of the ring. The entangled state is produced quickly, on time scales\ncomparable to the passage of the electron through the ring. Since the entanglement in principle\nis generated in a single quasi-instantaneous scattering event, the proposed mechanism is robust\nagainst decoherence.\nNew Journal of Physics 9 (2007) 67 (http:\/\/www.njp.org\/)\n10 DEUTSCHE PHYSIKALISCHE GESELLSCHAFT\nThe mesoscopic components for the proposed entanglement circuit\u2014double quantum dots,\nring geometries of quantum wires, and charge electrometers based on the electrostatic coupling\nof quantum dots to quantum wires\u2014have been realized and combined in numerous experiments\nover the past decade, and recently the dynamics of static qubits in double quantum dots has been\nmonitored successfully [16, 18]. An initial experiment would target the finite conductance of the\nmesoscopic ring at half a flux quantum, \u0001AB = h\/2e, where the conventional Aharonov\u2013Bohm\neffect would yield total destructive interference and hence no current. The shot noise provides an\nindirect measurement of the underlying correlated dynamics of the tunnel charge and the mobile\nelectron. A direct experimental investigation of the ensuing entanglement requires to measure\nthe correlations between the individual transmission and reflection events and the pseudospin\ndynamics of the double quantum dot. The cross-correlation measurements could be carried out\nwith a stationary stream of electrons, at a small bias V < tD\/eh\u00af (hence an attempt frequency less\nthan the typical dwell time tD of an electron in the ring). As in other proposals involving flying\nqubits, the incoming stream of electrons can be further diluted by a tunnel barrier in the lead from\nthe electronic source. In a more sophisticated setting, a single charge would be driven into the\nsystem via an electronic turnstile [22]. It also may be desirable to lead the reflected or transmitted\ncharges into dedicated channels via electronic beam splitters or chiral edge states [23].\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank C W J Beenakker and T Brandes for helpful discussions.
