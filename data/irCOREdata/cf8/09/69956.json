Some other properties of\nsuch forms are given.\n1991 Mathematics subject classification: 46L30.\n1. Introduction\nLet A, B be complex C*-algebras with identities eA, eB. We say that a bilinear form V\non A x B is unital if\nV(eA,eB) = \\\\V\\\\=\\.\nNote that if A,B are finite-dimensional and V is any bilinear form with | |K | |=1 , then\nthere will be unitary elements xoeA, yoeB such that V(xo,yo)=l, and a unital form Vx\nis then obtained by putting Vl(x,y) = V(xox,yoy).\nIf V is unital, then states <f> (on A), ip (on B) are defined by: <j>{x)= V(x,eB),\n\\p(y) = V(eA,y). A result of Haagerup [2] states that we then have\nfor self-adjoint x,y. This is not true for \\V(x,y)\\ or for non-self-adjoint elements, though\nGrothendieck-type theorems assert the existence of other states <j>', ijj' giving such\ninequalities with an intervening constant.\nThis result is an essential lemma in Haagerup's proof of the C*-algebra version of\nGrothendieck's inequality. A second essential, and rather tricky, lemma (Lemma 3.2)\ndeals with Im V(x,y) in the very special case A = B = l\\,. Bilinear forms on \\\\ are thus of\nkey importance for the general case. They are also of considerable interest in their own\nright. Our main theorem (Theorem 2) states that for a unital bilinear form V on l2x,\nwith <t>, ip defined as above, we have\n\\v(x,y)\\2S<H\\x\\2)il>(\\y\\2)\n521\n522 G. J. O. JAMESON\nfor all x,y. This easily implies Haagerup's Lemma 3.2. Furthermore, it reproves the\nknown fact [1], [7] that Grothendieck's theorem holds with constant 1 for \/\u00a3,, but with\nthe extra feature that it identifies the dominating states as the <f>, ij\/ defined above. There\nwould appear to be no other known situation where there is a ready-made formula for\nthe \"best\" dominating states for a given bilinear form. We show by an example that the\n<p, \\j\/ above (which are, of course, the natural candidates) are no longer the best choice\neven in the case l2x x \/^; the best constant is, of course, already unknown for this case.\nHence it is not surprising that some quite delicate work is needed to obtain our\nTheorem 2.\nIt is not at all easy, a priori, to recognise when a bilinear form on \/\u00a3, is unital. Our\nTheorem 1 provides a full\u2014and perhaps unexpected\u2014characterization of such forms in\nterms of the real and imaginary parts in the 2 x 2 matrix (V(ej,ek)): in the notation used\nbelow, the non-trivial condition involved is h2 ^bcd + acd + abd + abc. The deduction of\nTheorem 2 then roughly mimics one of the standard proofs of the commutative\nGrothendieck inequality; in a quite natural way, the inequality just mentioned is seen to\nbe exactly what is needed. On the way to Theorem 1, we find further interesting\nproperties of unital forms, in some cases applying to C*-algebras generally. For\nexample, if O^x^e^ and 0^_y^eB, then the least possible value for Re V(x,y) is exactly\n~~ 8-\nWe finish by giving short proofs, avoiding our theorems 1 and 2, of Haagerup's\nLemma 3.2 and of the fact that the complex 2 x 2 Grothendieck constant is 1.\n2. Elementary results\nNotation. As usual, l\"x denotes C with supremum norm. The y'th unit vector is\ndenoted by e,- and et + ---+en by e. For x,y in l\"x, the elements |x| and xy are defined\npointwise.\nOur first lemma, which is implicitly in [2], explains why certain results on l\\ are\napplicable to the general case.\nLemma 2.1. Let V be a unital bilinear form on AxB. Let p,q be elements such that\n,0^q^eB. Then there is a unital bilinear form VY on l2x such that:\n), V1(el,e2) = V(p,eB-q),\nVMi,^)=V{eA-p,q), Vl(e2,e2)=V(eA-p,eB-q).\nProof. This follows from the fact that for such p,\nwhich is easily seen, e.g. from the Gelfand representation.\nLemma 2.2.

By convexity and scalar multiplication, ||K|| is the maximum modulus of\nnumbers of the form\nwhere |p| = |A| = |\/i| = l. For fixed p., we can choose p and \/ to make this expression equal\nWe shall use this lemma constantly, sometimes with the expression in the equivalent\nform \\p.~ict + pP\\ + \\p.~ly + p.8\\. Clearly, \/? and y can be interchanged, and we may\nconsider \\p\\^\\ instead of \\p\\ = \\. Also, if V is defined by V(ej,ek) = V(e},ek), then\nY\\. The form W = j(V + V) is then hermitian (i.e. W(x,y) is real for real x,y) and\n\\\\w\\\nLemma 2.3. The matrix of a unital bilinear form on l2x is of the form\n(a + ih b- ih\\\n\\c-ih d + ih)'\nwhere each of a + b, c + d, a + c, b + d, a + d, b + c is non-negative and a + b + c + d\u2014 1.\nProof. Let the matrix be\nU 0\n\\y 8\nPositive functionals <j), ty are defined by: 0(x) = V(x, e), ij\/(y) = V(e, y). Hence\nare all real and non-negative. Therefore the matrix has the form stated. Clearly,\nV{e,e) = a + b + c + d=\\. Also,\n524 G. J. O. JAMESON\nso a + d and b + c are non-negative. (From the imaginary part, we see that |\/i|^|.)\nWe shall use the notation of Lemma 2.3 consistently. We give simple direct proofs of\nthe next three results, although they are implied by later theorems.\nLemma 2.4. For a unital form on 1%, as above, if a + b = 0, then a = b = h = O.\nEquivalently, if<l>(el)=0, then K(e,,e,) = 0.\nHence if A,B are C*'-algebras, V is a unital form on A x B, 0^p^eA, 0^q^eB and\n= 0,then V(p,q)=0.\nProof. Note that c + d=\\. If \/ i#0, then |c-i7i| + |rf + (7i|> 1, hence ||K||>1. SO \/I = 0.\nBy Lemma 2.2, we also have |c + \/a| + \\d \u2014 ia\\^ 1, hence a = 0.\nThe last statement follows at once, by Lemma 2.1.\nFor the real part, it is easy to improve this result, as follows.\nLemma 2.5. For a unital form on l2K as above, we have a2f^(a + b)(a + c), i.e.\nHence if V is a unital form on A x B, and 0^p^eA, 0^q^eB, then \\ReV(p,q)\\2^\nProof. As mentioned above, the form remains unital if we change h to 0, so we\nassume that h = 0. Let\nF((x,P) = Re V(ei\u00b0e1 + e2,eil!el+e2)\n= a cos (a + P) + b cos a + c cos \/? + d.\nThen F(a.,fi)^\\ for all a,\/? and F(0,0)=l. The second-order partial derivatives at (0,0)\nare\n{DllF)(0,0)=-a-b,\n(D22F)(0,0)=-a-c,\n(Dl2F)(0,0)=-a.\nThe statement follows, by the standard conditions for a local maximum.\nProposition 2.6. For a unital form on \/\u00a3, as above,\nbed + acd + abd + abc > 0.\nA SPECIFIC FORM OF GROTHENDIECK'S INEQUALITY 525\nProof. If a + b = 0, then by Lemma 2.4, a = b=O, and the expression is zero. Similarly\nif c + d = 0. Assume that a + b > 0 and c + d > 0. Now\n= a\n2\n + 2ab(2x2-l) + b2,\nwhere x = cos 9.

Let V be a unital bilinear form on Ax B, and let 0^p^eA, O^q^eB.\nThen the least possible value for Re V(p, q) is \u2014\\, and this can occur.\nProof. By Lemma 2.1, we have to show that for a unital form on l2^, with the above\nnotation, we must have a'Si\u2014^. Assume that a<0, and write a= \u2014 a'. It is elementary\nthat the form obtained by replacing b and c by j(b + c) is still unital: hence we may\nassume that b = c. Since b^a'>0, Proposition 2.6 becomes b{a + d) + 2ad^0, or\nNow d^.a' (since a + d^.0), so in fact d>a'. Write d = (\\ +k)a'. Our inequality becomes\nor b^2{l+k~l)a'. Also, 2b + d-a'= a + b + c + d=l, so\nThe least value of k + 4k~l is 4. Hence a'^f.\nWe now show that a unital form on \/\u00a3, is given by\n-1\/8 3\/8\n3\/8 3 \/8 \/\n526 G. J. O.

Writing x = cos0, we have\nThe required inequality is: (4 \u2014 3X2)1 \/ 2 + 3JC^4 for |x |^ l . This is correct, since\n(4-3x) 2 - (4-3x 2 ) =\nRemark. The example given is in fact the unique unital form on l2x having a= \u2014 5.\nFor, given such a form with b = c, we then require k = 2 in the above proof, hence\nd = b = \\. We cannot have 6 = \u00a7 + <5, c = \u00a7\u20145 with <5>0, since then the expression in\nProposition 2.6 is negative. So b = c = \\, and this expression equals 0; it will follow from\nTheorem 1 that \/i = 0.\nTwo further examples may be instructive at this point.\nExample 2.8. In the case of real l2x, it is trivial that\n1\/2 1\/2\n1\/2 1\/2\ndefines a unital bilinear form. This shows that results 2.4 to 2.7 fail in the real case.\nExample 2.9.

Then\na(l-A) + a(l-X) = 2Re(a-cd),\nso\nsince it equals either 4|Re(<x)| or 4|Re(od)|.\nA SPECIFIC FORM OF GROTHENDIECK'S INEQUALITY 527\n3. Characterization of unital bilinear forms on 1%\nLet V be a unital bilinear form on \/\u00a3, with matrix as above. Haagerup, [2, Lemma\n3.2], gives an upper estimate for the imaginary part h. We will derive a rather stronger\nestimate which turns out, together with the other more obvious conditions, to be\nnecessary and sufficient for V to be unital. Our estimate takes the rather unexpected\nform h2 ^ E, where \u00a3 is the quantity in Proposition 2.6. We see later that this is exactly\nwhat is needed to prove our Grothendieck-type theorem.\nThe proof involves some manipulation, but the principle is elementary. The proof of\nnecessity (which is what is really wanted for applications) essentially consists of squaring\ntwice to remove the square roots implicit in the statement | |K | | ^1 . The proof of\nsufficiency then amounts to a careful check that these steps are reversible.\nWith our usual notation, write\nA = ab \u2014 cd,\nE = bed + acd + abd + abc,\nF = (a + d)(b + c)(a + c)(b + d).\nThe next lemma is only needed for sufficiency.\nLemma 3.1.

Suppose now that statements (i), (ii), (iiia) hold. Both squaring steps can\nbe reversed provided that the right-hand side in (1) is between 0 and 2 (we will then\nhave |T |_1 where needed for the first step). By (iiia) and Lemma 3.1, this amounts to\nshowing that\nIt is clearly enough to show that c2 + rf2 + 2F1\/2\n = 1.

First, consider the case where one of ^ (e j , <f>{e2) (say <p(e2)) is 0. By\nLemma 2.4, we then have (with our previous notation) c=d=h=0 and a+ 6=1.

For l2m, this follows immediately, since 0(x2) ^ 4>(x), etc. The result for general\nC*-algebras follows, by Lemma 2.1.\nThis corollary combines Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 of [2] (where the real and imaginary\nparts are considered separately) in the form actually required for the proof of the\ngeneralized Grothendieck inequality. We remark that it is quite easy to deduce\nCorollary 4.3 from Theorem 1 without Theorem 2: in our usual notation, one shows\nthat a2 + h2^(a + b)(a + c). Since even the proof of our Theorem 1 is as much work as\nthe proof of Haagerup's lemmas, we give an alternative short proof of Corollary 4.3 in\nSection 5.\nHigher dimensions; Grothendieck's inequality\nThe standard Grothendieck inequality states that for a bilinear form V on \\\"m with\nnorm 1, there are states <f>', tj\/' such that |K(x,)')|2^KG$'(|x|2)i\/''(|)'|2) for all x, y. One\napproach to this is somewhat analogous to our proof of Theorem 2 (cf. [5, chapter 9];\n[3, p. 115]). Once one has found <\u00a3' such that |K(x,y)|gK||jc||^||j'||0O, Theorem 9.4 of [5]\ndoes the rest. The hard part, proving the existence of <f>', is equivalent to showing that\n7t2(S)SK||S||, where S:\/^-W\" is given by (Sx)(y) = V(x,y). For n>2 , our 0 will not serve\nas <j>'.

By finite approximation, it follows that the n2 appearing above cannot be\nreplaced by a constant independent of n.\nExample 4.4. The following example (which is adopted from Haagerup's) shows that\neven in the case of \/^ x l3x, the best value of C in the above statement is at least ^Jl,\nand that <j), ip is not the best choice of dominating functionals. This demonstrates a\nfundamental difference between the 2 x 2 and 2 x 3 cases, rather analogous to the\ndifference between the C*-algebras on Z 2 * Z2 and Z2 * Z 3 (cf. [6]).\nLet \/ = [ \u2014 n\/2, n\/2] and let Vo be Haagerup's bilinear form:\nV0(x,f)=1-x(l)Sf(t)e\"dt+l-x(2)$f(t)e-\u00bbdt.\nChoose (5>0 and partition \/ into\n'-[!-*\u00a7}\nI2= \u2014l\\ and 73 = \/\\(\/i u \/2).
