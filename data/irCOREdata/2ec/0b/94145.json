AGGRESSION AND \u2018NORMAL \nVIOLENCE\u2019 IN THE LIVES OF GIRLS AND BOYS \n \nCoretta Phillips   \nLondon School of Economics \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAbstract \n \nRecent research has focused on the aggression and violence experienced by young people in local \nschools and neighbourhoods. Self-report bullying, victimisation and offending studies have \ndocumented the pervasive nature of this violence in the lives of young people and the legitimacy that \nit has. This paper explores some emergent themes in this research which spans different disciplines, \nalso drawing heavily on the findings from a small, exploratory study of girls\u2019 violence. The \ndiscussion centres on the social context of aggression and violence, the functionality of such \nbehaviour, and its normalisation in adolescent life. The paper concludes by examining the \nimplications of this body of work for theory, policy and practice.   \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \n \nI would like to thank Ben Bowling, Ken Pease, Judith Rumgay, Betsy Stanko and the two \nanonymous reviewers for their comments on an earlier draft of this paper. \n   \n \n1\n \nIntroduction \n \nDuring the last two decades, research conducted within different disciplines, including education, \npsychology, sociology and criminology, has examined the extent and nature of aggressive and violent \nbehaviour among children and adolescents. From the literatures on peer aggression, school bullying, \nand within victimology and criminology, drawing on findings from victimisation and self-report \noffending surveys of young people, it has become evident that both boys and girls are frequently \ninvolved in incidents which would fit the definition of violent criminal offences (see for example \nCairns et al. 1988; Whitney and Smith 1993; Aye Maung 1995; Graham and Bowling 1995; Kershaw \net al. 2000). The hitherto neglected area of girls\u2019 violence is also now receiving research attention \n(see Campbell 1984, 1986; Phillips 1994; Archer 1998; Davies 1999; Batchelor, Burman and Brown \n2001). \n \nThe aim of this paper is to make connections between these somewhat disparate literatures by \ndrawing out three themes which have emerged. The first concerns the relatively high prevalence \nrates of violence in schools and local neighbourhoods for both boys and girls. The second theme \nfocuses on the functions that violence serves for both girls and boys. The third considers the \n\u2018normalisation\u2019 of aspects of abuse, harassment and violence in the lives of young people. In \naddition to reviewing the research literature, this paper will draw heavily on a small, exploratory \nstudy of girls\u2019 aggression and violence conducted in the early 1990s. It will conclude with a \nconsideration of the implications of this body of work for theory, policy and practice.   \n   \n \n2\n \nAggression and violence in young people\u2019s lives \n \nPatterns of school bullying \nThe large-scale pioneering research which first attempted to quantify the extent of school bullying \nwas carried out by Scandinavian researchers using anonymous self-report questionnaires and much \nof the British and Irish research has followed in this tradition. Whilst this research has provided an \ninvaluable source of information about bullying and violence in schools, comparisons across studies \nare rather difficult. Studies have used different methodologies, different definitions of bullying, and \ndifferent recall periods. For these reasons, the prevalence rates vary greatly, although the general \ntrend is for higher victimisation rates in primary schools than secondary schools.  \n \nOne of the largest UK studies (n=6758) conducted in Sheffield, found over a quarter of \njunior\/middle school pupils had been bullied \u2018sometimes\u2019 or more often in the current school term \n(Whitney and Smith 1993). Similarly, individual interviews with primary school children (n=2377) in \nHertfordshire and North London revealed a victimisation rate of around 30 per cent of pupils who \nsaid they were victimised frequently (four or more times) in the last six months (Wolke et al. 2001). \nIn the Sheffield secondary schools, 10 per cent of pupils experienced bullying, which included \nphysical, verbal and exclusionary forms of bullying. In the Sheffield schools the perpetration of \nbullying involved half the number of victims standing at 12 per cent in primary schools and 6 per \ncent in secondary schools (Whitney and Smith 1993). In contrast, Glover et al.\u2019s (2000) research  \n \n   \n \n3\n \nwith 4700 pupils in 25 secondary schools, found that physical bullying had affected around three-\nquarters of pupils in the past school year, as victims and bullies.  \n \nWhere there is more consensus in research findings is in the frequency with which bullying takes \nplace in schools. Frequent and chronic bullying tends to affect a far smaller proportion of children, \nwith rates ranging from 3 per cent to 12.5 per cent, although Wolke et al. (2001) found a quarter of \nprimary school pupils were victimised every week or very frequently. The Sheffield study reported \nthe repeated victimisation (bullied \u2018once a week\u2019 or more) of 10 per cent of pupils in junior and \nmiddle schools, dropping to 5 per cent of boys and 4 per cent of girls among secondary school \npupils (Whitney and Smith 1993). Similarly, despite Glover et al.\u2019s (2000) finding that the majority of \nsecondary school pupils in their study had experienced physical bullying, this was reduced to 5% of \npupils who had experienced more than seven physical bullying incidents.  \n \nThe studies in Scandinavia, Britain, and Ireland have generally reported higher rates of school \nbullying among boys in primary and middle schools (Olweus, 1990; Chazan 1989; Stephenson and \nSmith 1989; O'Moore and Hillery 1989; Boulton and Underwood 1992) and in secondary schools \n(Siann et al. 1994; Dale 1992). However, in the Sheffield study undertaken by Whitney and Smith \n(1993), gender differences were not apparent in levels of victimisation, but boys were more likely \nthan girls to be bullies. Moreover, boys were more subjected to direct bullying or open attacks, while \ngirls were more susceptible to social isolation and exclusion from the peer group, a finding replicated \nin many, but not all, studies of bullying (see for example Siann et al. 1994; Stephenson and Smith \n   \n \n4\n \n1989 cf. Boulton and Underwood 1992; Arora and Thompson 1987; Keise 1992). Glover et al. \n(2000), found, for example, little difference in the proportion of boys and girls who physically \nbullied other pupils, but they found that fewer girls than boys retaliated when they were victimised.  \n \nVictimisation and self-report offending research \nFurther academic and policy interest in the victimisation of young people by peers (and adults) is \nevidenced by the administration of large-scale surveys in the 1990s. These studies have documented \na high level of harassment and assaults in public places when compared with victimisation in the \nadult population. Anderson et al. (1994) surveyed young people (n=892) from four areas of Scotland \nand found that one half of boys in the sample reported being a victim of an assault, compared with \n23 per cent of girls, and almost half said that they had been \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018quite frightened\u2019 by the \nincident. The vast majority of assaults were committed by other young people (90 per cent of \nperpetrators assaulting boys and 83 per cent of those assaulting girls were aged 20 years or younger).  \n \nThe Scottish survey also revealed a relatively high violent offending rate with 23 per cent of boys \nand 7 per cent of girls having committed a serious violent offence (mainly assaults causing injury or \nstreet fights), frequently against someone of approximately the same age. Forty-three per cent of the \nsample had fought in the street, compared with 7 per cent of boys and 3 per cent of girls who \nadmitted to fighting in a national study of 14 to 25 year-olds (Graham and Bowling 1995). A more \nrecent study by Sutherland and Shepherd (2002), of 13,970 pupils at 47 secondary schools in \nEngland, reported 14% had been in a fight in the previous year, with significantly more boys (17 per \n   \n \n5\n \ncent) involved in incidents than girls (12 per cent). \n \nThe first national study of victimisation among young people in England and Wales was carried out \nby the Home Office in 1992 as part of the fourth sweep of the British Crime Survey. Forty per cent \nof boys and 23% of girls reported being assaulted in the previous six to eight months, and most of \nthe incidents involved same-age and same-sex perpetrators. Repeated victimisation was also reported \namongst a majority of victims. Comparison with adults surveyed by the BCS showed higher \nvictimisation risks for 12-15 year olds compared with older adults aged 20-59 years, with similar risks \nfor those aged 16-19 years (Aye Maung, 1995). In 2000, the BCS reported that 3.5 per cent of the \nsample (aged 16 years and over) had been the victim of a common assault or wounding with, as in \nprevious sweeps, the risks highest for men aged 16-24 years (Kershaw et al. 2000).  \n \nIn a study of neighbourhood bullying in two urban localities in the East Midlands, Percy-Smith and \nMatthews (2001) report the victimisation of 46% of young people (aged 10-15 years) in the inner \narea and 27% in the suburban area where the perpetrators were other young people. The bullying \ninvolved \u2018barging in\u2019 (disrupting younger children\u2019s games), \u2018extortion\u2019, intimidation for \nentertainment, and name-calling. \n \n \n \nGirls\u2019 violence \n   \n \n6\n \nUntil recently, Anne Campbell\u2019s research conducted in the UK and the US in the 1980s has been the \nonly work which focused exclusively on aggression and violence among girls and young women, \nincluding those not officially defined as violent. In one study, for example, schoolgirls in five areas \nwere asked to self-report their involvement in fights. Eighty-nine percent of the sample had ever \nbeen involved in a fight, most often with a female opponent (Campbell 1986).  \n \nCampbell\u2019s work on female aggression and violence has been supplemented in the 1990s. Davies\u2019 \n(1999) historical analysis of gang violence in late Victorian Manchester and Salford, for example, \nused press information and court records to demonstrate that street fights among rival gangs were \nfar from being a male-only preserve in working-class communities. Employed working-class women \nwho were involved in street violence were referred to in the press and by magistrates as morally \ndeficient \u2018viragoes\u2019, \u2018vixens\u2019 and \u2018Amazons\u2019. A more recent multi-method study in Scotland by \nBatchelor, Burman and Brown (2001) sought to explore the everyday experiences of violence in a \nsample of around 800 teenage girls from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds. In their \nquantitative self-report survey, 30% of girls said that they had hit, punched or kicked someone, while \n41 per cent had been victimised in this way. However, only one in ten girls were physically violent \non a regular basis.  \n \nTaken together, this research shows that aggression and violence are not rare occurrences in the lives \nof young people, although such behaviour appears to be entrenched amongst only a small minority. \nOf note too is the finding that while girls appear to be less involved as victims and perpetrators of \n   \n \n7\n \n                        \naggression and violence, their involvement in physically aggressive behaviour seems to be rather \nmore common than previous research would suggest. The early ethnographic research, for example, \ntended to focus on the violent behaviour of young men to the exclusion of young women, especially \nwhen examining physical fighting (see Patrick 1973; Corrigan 1976; Marsh, Rosser and Harr\u00e9 1978; \nRobins and Cohen 1978).  \n \nThe social context of girls\u2019 aggression and violence: an exploratory study \n \nInformed by Campbell\u2019s work, the current study focused on examining the extent to which the use \nof physical aggression was a common occurrence in the lives of girls and young women, and as such  \nwas regarded as \u2018normal\u2019 and acceptable behaviour1. This is clearly of relevance for understanding \nmore about the nature of aggression and violence within educational settings from the perspective of \nyoung people themselves, but it also provides an insight into the way girls reflect on normative \ngendered behaviour.   \n \nSemi-structured interviews were undertaken with 31 young women attending a further education \ncollege in South London in the early 1990s2. The sample broadly reflected the racial and social class \norigins of the college population. The sample was predominantly white (n=27), but included two \nstudents of African-Caribbean origin, one of African origin, and one student of Bangladeshi origin. \n \n1 The young women were asked about their experiences of physical, sexual and racial victimisation in the home. Under-\nreporting may have explained why very few respondents reported they had been victimised in these ways.  \n \n2 Two of the interviews were conducted at a further education college in an inner London borough in East London.  \n \n   \n \n8\n \n                        \nThe age range of the students was 16 to 22 years. The young women were predominantly lower \nmiddle-class and working-class. Because of the large catchment area of the college, some of the \ninterviewees lived in affluent suburban areas, while others came from a neighbouring inner London \nborough. The young women had attended both mixed and single-sex state schools. At the time of \ninterview, the young women were studying a wide range of academic and vocational courses.  \n \nThe young women were asked to recall their secondary school and college experiences as victims, \nwitnesses and perpetrators of aggressive and violent behaviour3. This self-report method is \nnecessarily dependent on respondents' honesty and willingness to divulge sensitive and negative \ninformation about themselves and in this case, their involvement in, what might be considered to be, \n \u2018gender-inappropriate\u2019 rather than traditionally feminine behaviour 4. As extracts from the \ninterviews of the young women will reveal, however, engaging in physically aggressive behaviour in \nschool was not regarded as necessarily anti-social, thus suggesting that respondents were not \nespecially susceptible to providing socially desirable responses. Indeed, Burman, Batchelor and \nBrown\u2019s (2001) methodological account of researching girls\u2019 violence and abuse in Scotland, pointed \nto the girls challenging the researchers\u2019 preconceptions about girls\u2019 violence and aggression. \nThe 'pecking order'  \n \n3 A methodological weakness of the study was its reliance on voluntary participation. A small self-selected sample was \nunlikely to be representative of girls at college generally, and may have interested only those who had had a significant \naggressive experience as victim or perpetrator. Further, locating the study in a further education college excluded those \nwho had not continued their education (see also Phillips 1994).  \n \n4 The study findings were also limited by the capacity of interviewees to remember - and avoid distorting - their \nrecollections of violent incidents which may have occurred some years previously. However, there is some evidence to \nsuggest that there is relative stability of recall in retrospective reports of school bullying among gay and bisexual men \nand women (Rivers 2001), and this may be true of heterosexual young women too. \n \n   \n \n9\n \n                                                                              \nThe young women interviewed reported that school, for the most part, had been a reasonably \ntrouble-free, and for some, an enjoyable experience. All of the young women had friends on whom \nthey depended for social support. The majority of the young women could be said to have a 'pro-\nschool' attitude and many aspired to professional careers. Notwithstanding the positive  \nexperiences of the young women, the interviews revealed a backdrop of aggressive behaviour in the \nlives of the girls at school, evidenced by the reporting of a social order of girls in school, diamond in \nshape with the majority of pupils falling between the two extremes. At the top of the hierarchy was \nthe 'in-group'.  \n \nThe in-group was defined as a group of girls identified as leaders with a reputation for being 'hard' \n(powerful, tough and aggressive) people. For the most part, the in-group established and maintained \ntheir powerful position by verbally and physically bullying other girls, by using intimidation and \npicking fights with girls in the lower echelons of the hierarchy5. A very precise definition of the \nhierarchy of the social order, termed a 'pecking order' was provided by one student (Darrannelle)6. \nShe described how Girl A was seen as the Top Cat or Top Dog; the main 'henpecker' or leader. She \ncould hit Girl B, C or D, but they could not 'peck' the Top Cat\/Dog. Girl A had reached her \nposition by winning more fights than girls B, C and D. Campbell's (1981) research with Borstal girls \nalso noted a pecking order among girls in school, established by physical fighting, and Glover et al\u2019s \n \n \n5 Even at college in-groups were in existence, although verbal aggression and intimidation were used more often than \nphysical aggression to show who was the 'boss' of the college (see McDougall 1999 for a study of bullying at a further \neducation college). The students also mentioned gangs outside school. These were usually mixed-sex gangs who 'ruled' \nlocal areas; effectively out-of-school 'in-groups'. The girls would usually just be involved in 'mouthing' to the girls in the \nother gang, criticising their territory (area), for example.  \n   \n \n10\n \n                                                                              \ninterviews with secondary school pupils referred to \u2018gangs\u2019 of both \u2018hard\u2019 boys and girls, and pecking \norders have been observed in residential settings (see for example Campbell 1986; Cawson et al. \n2002). \n \nThe pecking order in school was maintained through the use of physical aggression and violence \nwhereby physical strength and dominance were regarded as desirable qualities by many girls. \nSeemingly, many of the girls aspired to power, status, and reputation within social hierarchies in the \nsame way that it has been suggested that boys, particularly working-class, boys do (Robins and \nCohen 1978; Marsh, Rosser and Harr\u00e9 1978; B. Campbell 1993; see also Messerschmidt 2000; \nAnderson et al. 1993; Canaan 1996). Indeed, one GCSE respondent actually described the in-group \nat her single-sex school as the 'lads of the school'.  \n \nHowever, it must be noted that there was not a consensus about the popularity of the girls who \nformed the in-group. For some respondents who were part of, or on the margins of the in-group, \nthe in-group members were remembered as the popular and admired members of school. For others \nwho were usually less prominent in school, the 'middlewomen' and the lowest echelon of the \ndiamond, the in-group would be avoided wherever possible because they were viewed as trouble-\nmakers, but they were also regarded as being somewhat pathetic and cowardly since their position \nrelied on acting as a member of a powerful group rather than as an individual. This fits well with the \nfindings from studies of bullying, which reveal average or above average popularity ratings of bullies \nby peers, teachers, and in terms of bullies\u2019 own perceptions of self-worth (Johnson and Lewis 1999; \n \n6 Pseudonyms have been used to preserve anonymity. \n   \n \n11\n \nBoulton and Smith 1994). The concept of the in-group or pecking order thus captures notions of \nviolence and danger for outsiders, but also safety for the in-group or its supporters, as the in-group \nmight also act as a source of protection to fend off attack.  \n \nParticularly significant, however, for conceptualising aggression amongst girls, was the finding that \nthe use of aggression in school was not limited to the actions of the in-group, but instead tended to \nbe rather more pervasive. The tactics used by the in-group were not their exclusive domain and they \nwere also often used by other girls ranked in the middle of the pecking order to abuse and intimidate \nsimilarly-ranked girls or occasionally those at the bottom of the hierarchy. In the main, however, \ngirls in the middle echelon were more likely to use aggressive behaviour in the context of disputes \nresulting from failed friendships.  \n \nResearch on the gendered nature of school bullying has noted the way in which girls suffer when \nfriendships break down (for example Besag 1989; Keise 1992) explained by the fact that friendship \ngroups between girls are more close-knit and relations more intense than among boys (Meyenn \n1980; Nilan 1991). Both Griffiths\u2019 (1995) and Hey\u2019s (1997) recent ethnographies of girls\u2019 friendship \nin school provide detailed insights into the methods that girls use to negotiate the difficult territory \nof social relations with other girls, and notes the fear and pain associated with upsetting friends. \nThese close but fragile relationships may increase the potential for conflict leading to prolonged \npatterns of bullying and aggression (Maccoby 1986; Savin-Williams 1980; Campbell 1993; see also \nBurman et al. 2002). \n   \n \n12\n \nThose on the lowest rung of the pecking order in schools were vulnerable to victimisation, \nparticularly from the in-group. The configuration of the pecking order appeared to be similar in the \nschools that the interviewees attended, but differences were apparent in the basis for occupying \ndifferent positions within the hierarchy. Mention was made of the pecking order being constructed \nalong social class lines where \u2018posh\u2019 pupils were ranked at the bottom in one interviewee\u2019s account. \nIn other accounts it appeared that those girls considered to be physically and emotionally immature \nfound themselves in the lower echelons of the social order, whereas those who were more \n\u201cstreetwise and sophisticated\u201d, and often presenting behavioural problems for teachers, were able to \noccupy a higher position within the in-group. Moreover, although there was some fluidity in \nindividual rankings within the pecking order with some renegotiation, there was a strong sense in \nwhich the girls knew their place within it.   \n \n \nVerbal aggression and intimidation \nThe young women's accounts revealed that the abuse and harassment of other pupils frequently \ninvolved the use of verbal aggression and intimidation, confirming the pattern identified in previous \nresearch on sex differences in aggression and school bullying (Maccoby and Jacklin 1974; Hyde 1984 \nand see earlier discussion on school bullying). Interviewees believed girls to be more 'bitchy' than \nboys, and that this behaviour was far more oppressive and hurtful than one-off incidents of physical \nviolence. As one respondent, Helen, said \u201c[a]lthough you get the physical pain when they hit you, it \nsoon heals up and you don't get scarred. But emotional scars from bitchy fights lasts a lot longer.\u201d \nBitchiness' is an all-encompassing term used to define a wide spectrum of behaviour such as name-\n   \n \n13\n \ncalling, spreading rumours and talking about people behind their backs, giving 'dirty looks' (staring \naggressively), and acting to secretly exclude others from common activities. Verbal abuse, ostracism \nand exclusionary tactics were used as 'weapons' in several disputes between friends, involving those \nin the in-group and those in the middle rank of the pecking order. Batchelor, Burman and Brown\u2019s \n(2001) research with Scottish girls similarly emphasised the regularity and significant effects of such \nabuse (see also Owens, Slee and Shute 2000). \n \nThe effects of being bullied by friends or other girls in school were frequently damaging. As would \nbe expected, fear was common as the perpetrators were often regarded as powerful individuals \nwithin school. The girls sought to avoid victimisation  where possible, and this often left them no \noption but to miss school, sometimes at a crucial stage in their educational careers. Previous research \nhas pointed to other harmful effects of being bullied such as low self-esteem, school absenteeism \nand truancy, physical illness, nervousness, impaired concentration and possible self-harm (Olweus, \n1990; Sharp, 1995).  \n \nPhysical aggression and violence \nEight of the 31 interviewees admitted bullying other pupils at school, and one described herself as \nboth a victim and a bully. The methods used by these girls tended to include both verbal and \nphysical aggression. The two extracts presented below are representative of the types of incidents \ninvolving physical force: \n   \n \n14\n \n\u2026 it was our area, you know, we were always there, everyone would expect to see us \nthere. Anyway, one day we were there and these girls came along and said 'Fuck off \nthis is our area, we don't want you here', I mean we refused to move... and it just \nstarted from there, they would come round and throw things at us...and you know if \nthey were near enough, if they could walk past us and shove us without looking \nreally obvious they would do it\u2026  ... I suppose they felt, I don't know, they had \npower, they could see two people squirming at what they were doing, so that's why \nthey did it. (Angela) \n \nAnother student, part of the in-group in her school, recalled how she and a group of friends had \nbeen responsible for bullying a girl whom they felt was too 'mouthy': \n... we just surrounded her and were pushing her around... There was a few Bengali \nboys who backed us and just stood there so nobody else could sort of interfere or \nmuck in and try and stop it. We weren't actually hurting her, we were pushing her \naround and taking her shoe, throwing it from place to place and throwing it over the \nroad and that. We did it until we actually got her into tears and then we left her. \n(Rehana) \n \nWhilst the majority of the young women interviewed, three-quarters, had witnessed fights between \ngirls, fewer of them (just under one half) had been directly involved in a physical fight whilst at \nsecondary school. As found in much previous research on girls\u2019 violence, it was rare for girls to use \n   \n \n15\n \nphysical violence on a regular basis, although verbal aggression and intimidation was much more \ncommonplace in local neighbourhoods. The accounts showed that fights varied according to the \nlevel of consent and initiation involved, but they were most commonly started following derogatory \ncomments being made about a girl, following the same pattern observed for boys and young men \n(see for example Polk 1994). Some fights were initiated by the respondents or engaged in \nenthusiastically following a challenge:   \nIt was silly really, cos she, I wasn't in the class, but I left my bag in the classroom, \nshe's come, like people told me that is what she done. She come in the classroom \nand my bag was in her way, and she said 'Who's bag is this?' and no-one answered \nher, so she just got it, bashed it on the side and things fell out and so she just got it \npicked it up and emptied it all out...I came back inside and everything was on the \nfloor...no-one would say who it was...everyone was saying 'I'm not a grass'... the next \nmorning everyone come up to me and said 'Don't say nothing, don't say that I said, \nbut it was Juliet...so I just went up to her and beat her up... I punched her in the \nface...she hit me back and then I like punched her and she hit me and I hit her \nback...she was dragging me down onto the floor...People were saying that I won \nbecause when she left, like around the corner, she started crying (Karleen). \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n16\n \nIn the following account, Nicole witnessed a fight between two girls which had racial overtones: \nThere was just dirty looks going around the classroom, and then Lisa started on her \nand called her a Big Mama and that\u2019s why they had this fight lunchtime. ...She \npunched her on the face, got up and just like kicked her and then walked off. She \nhad a few like bruises, cuts on her lip, but nothing else... \n  \nOther fights were consented to reluctantly where another girl had initiated the fight. Where this \noccurred, the young women reported being in a quandary: not fighting would lead them to lose their \ncredibility or even if they did not have a reputation they would come to be seen as a 'wimp'; thus \nthey felt forced into accepting the challenge even when they knew that their opponent was 'harder' \nthan them. Reluctant fighting to protect a reputation has been referred to in the literature on boys \nand young men (see for example Robins and Cohen 1978; Marsh, Rosser and Harr\u00e9 1978; \nMesserschmidt 2000). Similar views emerged in the study of Scottish girls, where \u2018sticking up for \nyourself\u2019 was of central importance in everyday life (Batchelor, Burman and Brown 2001). As is \nevident in the following account given by Angela, we should not underestimate the impact of peer \npressure on girls to engage in violence (see also Campbell 1990): \n \n   \n \n17\n \n... we decided we were going to fight after school and then we had to walk through \nthis alley to get home and I met her there and we had a fight. It was cold and clinical \nand I upset everyone because I punched her in the nose and I wasn't supposed to do \nthat... there was a lot of blood and a lot of screaming, she was pulling my head \ndown, I punched upwards as she was hurting my head. I remember when I was \nhaving a bath my head felt like lead, it was horrible. These Fifth Formers split us up \nand said 'You're not supposed to do that, you're only First Years'\u2026I wasn\u2019t fighting \nfor anything\u2026I was fighting because I said I was going to (Angela). \n \nFighting may also result when girls judge and police the sexual behaviour of other girls, as illustrated \nin a fight observed by Darrannelle: \n \n... she was in the Fourth or Fifth Year Common Room and there was a whole crowd \nof kids...her and another girl just grabbed hold of this girl and they started beating \nher up, punching her in the face...they said she went under the garages with some \nboys...because of that they called her a slag and started hitting her and punching her. \n \n \n \nThe functions of aggression and violence \n \n   \n \n18\n \nIn interpreting the narratives of the young women, the use of aggression and violence by girls can be \nseen to serve a function in their social worlds. Abusing other girls allowed the perpetrator to feel \ngood, to show off how 'hard' they were, with the aim of enhancing their reputation and \nstrengthening their position within the social hierarchy of the school. The interviews revealed too \nthat fighting provided a means for defending or enhancing status by assuaging threats to personal \nintegrity and image. The same finding has emerged in studies of gang violence involving young men \nand women, (see for example Fagan 1996; Campbell 1984; Joe Laidler and Hunt 2001), in accounts \nof hegemonic masculinities (for example Epstein et al. 2001; Canaan 1996), and in research on girls\u2019 \nand boys\u2019 violence (Campbell 1986; Anderson et al. 1994; Boulton 1993; Baskin and Sommers \n1998). Batchelor, Burman and Brown (2001), for example, interviewed a minority of girls who \nperceived fighting to be a fundamental aspect of their self-identity with a \u2018hard\u2019 reputation being \nsomething to be proud of. Even for the majority who do not use physical violence with any \nregularity, it does seem evident that young people use physical, verbal, and psychological aggression \nin the process of negotiating and asserting their public identity in school and other local spaces.  \n \nFighting appeared to serve a further purpose: it helped to release tension and frustration, a finding \nconsistent with the early psychological research which emphasised the rational nature of aggressive \nbehaviour as a response to a frustrating stimulus (Dollard et al. 1944). Fights were frequently \nconsidered as preferable to verbal confrontations and disputes which might brew for long periods of \ntime. The devastating impact of verbal aggression and intimidation on the lives of girls previously \nreferred to helps explain this finding.  \n   \n \n19\n \n                        \n \nViolent encounters between girls also provided entertainment both for willing participants and \nobservers; they were perceived of as 'just a laugh', providing excitement, a \u2018buzz\u2019. Fights would often \npull a large crowd of spectators who would cheer and encourage the fight to continue. This was \nenabled by the fact that most fights were organised to take place at a time and location where \ndetection by adults was less likely7. The entertainment value of violence has been noted in previous \nresearch (Fox, 1977; Campbell, 1981). The interviewees reported that boys might be particularly \nentertained by girls' fights and they would often \u2018egg on\u2019 the participants. There was even some \nsuggestion that boys might be attracted to the tough girls who could 'handle' themselves in a fight. \nNotwithstanding this, more traditional views about the use of physical aggression by girls were also \napparent. Some of the respondents noted that some boys and teachers found the sight of girls \nfighting disgusting, shocking, 'unladylike', and outrageous.  \n \nThe young women\u2019s accounts also revealed the ritualistic nature of fights among girls. Ethologists \nsuch as Lorenz (1966) and Tinbergen (1964) have long since observed the ritualism of aggressive \nbehaviour amongst animals, where pecking orders exist to contain inter- and intra-species violence. \nThis is achieved by the use of minor fighting and submission gestures that guarantee minimal harm \nis incurred when there is motivation to attack. In the current research it was certainly the case that \nthe way in which fights were organized did mean that the violence was limited. The fights were rule-\ngoverned: they were only perceived to be fair when they were one-on-one encounters, and where the \n \n7 Little of girls\u2019 violence appears to come to the attention of the police. In 2000, of those offenders found guilty at court \nor cautioned for violence against the person offences, 14,600 (26 per cent of the total) were aged 10-17 years, and of \nthese, only 20 per cent (n=2900) were girls (Home Office 2001).  \n   \n \n20\n \ngirls used the same method of hair-pulling, scratching, kicking (a 'catfight') and\/or punching, or \nusing a weapon ('a real fight'). About one-half of the fights that the girls had were 'catfights', the \nremainder consisted of the girls throwing punches as well, but the use of weapons was only noted in \nfights that were observed, rather than directly participated in. The young women recalled that \nalthough fights might well lead to superficial injuries, such as bruised eyes or 'busted\u2019 lips, they were \ntypically contained by bystanders, in that they would never be allowed to continue until 'serious' \nphysical injuries occurred (see also Levine et al. 2002).  \n \nConsequently, the majority of the fights continued only until one or more of the spectators present - \nusually friends or family members - chose to stop the fight when they believed that the fight was \nbecoming too violent. Two fights were also brought to an abrupt end by the intervention of teachers \nand the police. A further indication of the ritualistic nature of fighting was the relationships between \nthe two girls following the fight. Many of the girls' fights were characterised by the temporary nature \nof the hostility. Shortly after the fight, the dispute could be forgotten and ignored in future \nfriendships. This suggests that the use of physical aggression by girls may be viewed simply as a \nmeans for girls to confront status-threatening behaviour by others. Once this is achieved through \nacceptable channels, a semblance of normal social relations can be resumed.  \n \n \nThe \u2018normalisation\u2019 of aggression and violence \n \n   \n \n21\n \nThe current research paints a picture of aggressive encounters between girls which often included \nphysical violence set against the backdrop of a pecking order of girls. The use of physical aggression \nby girls was considered to be commonplace in schools and local neighbourhoods, albeit that it was \nrarely of a very serious nature. Perhaps more significantly, the young women\u2019s accounts, which drew \non personal, direct and vicarious experiences, revealed that fighting by girls (and boys) was a regular \noccurrence in school, and as such, constituted \u2018normal\u2019 behaviour. For the most part (and I will \nreturn to this point later in the paper), the girls themselves did not appear to have been influenced \nby any external pressures to act in a gender-appropriate way by avoiding the use of physical \naggression. There was not a widespread perception that using physical aggression was deviant; \nindeed, the respondents suggested that the girls who fought were admired by some girls, even \nidolised. Nor did it appear to be the case that those who observed fights attached any negative \nsignificance to the appropriateness of the use of physical aggression by girls.  \n \nThe idea that violent behaviour has legitimacy for certain individuals is not a new one. Wolfgang and \nFerracuti (1967), for example, argued that a system of norms, values and attitudes was present in \nsome lower-class subcultures which supported and advocated violence, although empirical support \nfor the subculture of violence has been lacking (Siann 1985). A more empirically embedded account \nof \u2018everyday violence\u2019 in the lives of women and men has been presented in Betsy Stanko\u2019s work, \nwhere she argues that violence is an ordinary part of life, and as such, it is routinely managed by \nindividuals, particularly through the use of safety precautions taken to enhance personal safety (see \nfor example Stanko 1990; Stanko and Hobdell 1993). \n   \n \n22\n \n \nYoung people\u2019s conceptualisation of this \u2018normal violence\u2019 is a common thread running through the \nliteratures on school bullying and victimisation. Glover et al\u2019s (2000) study of 25 secondary schools \nsuggested that pupils absorb a culture which exists among peers; with fewer older than younger \npupils indicating that they believed that there were rarely or never good reasons for fighting in \nschool. In a similar vein, Aye Maung (1995) reported that aggressive and violent incidents involving \nyoung people aged under 16 years were typically regarded as \"just something that happens, or to a \nlesser extent, \"wrong but not a crime\". Similar findings were reported in the two Scottish studies \nwith Anderson et al. (1994: 90) noting that \u201c[I]t is by no means an exaggeration to say that violence \nis an accepted part of life, for girls as well as boys.\u201d. Cullingford and Morrison\u2019s (1995) interviews \nwith young offenders also refers to the pervasiveness of bullying and fighting in school. The general \nethos of aggression was accepted as a normal aspect of school life. This perception was echoed in \nneighbourhood contexts in Batchelor, Burman and Brown\u2019s study, among both those who were \nobservers of violence and those who more regularly engaged in physical violence. Similarly, the \n\u2018tyrannical spaces\u2019 inhabited by young people in two urban neighbourhoods in the East Midlands \nwere ones in which \u2018acts of bullying, whether as perpetrator or victim, are not necessarily remarkable \nor unusual, but form an everyday part of some people\u2019s lives\u2019 (Percy-Smith and Matthews 2001: 53). \n   \n \n23\n \nWhile the findings from the current research and previous studies would suggest that both boys and \ngirls have normalised and routinised the use of aggression and violence, Painter (1993) draws our \nattention to the relatively minor nature of much violence in young people\u2019s lives. She too found that \nviolence was an everyday phenomenon for the young people she interviewed on two housing estates \nin the West Midlands, but she noted that little of the violence was regarded as serious.  \nMoreover, in the current research it was clear from the reflections of the young women, once at \ncollege, that such aggressive behaviour, particularly bullying could be legitimised (and effectively \nneutralised) precisely because it was located in an earlier time period; bullying was 'a school-time \nthing'. However, for the young women, having to recall these incidents in the interview meant that \nthey were forced to re-evaluate their actions. The majority now saw their victimisation of others in \nschool as wrong and harmful. At the time they were not aware of the full impact of their own \nbehaviour on the other person, and they were only able to define the events as for their own social \nbenefit; that is part of \u2018having a laugh\u2019 or in building a \u2018hard\u2019 reputation in school. \n \nDesistance and femininity \nA common consensus was that fighting tended to stop in the mid- to late teenage years or on leaving \nschool. Of the fifteen students who had been involved in a physical fight, none had fought in the \nprevious six months whilst attending further education college. Thirteen of the respondents claimed \nthat they had grown out of fighting, or that fighting was no longer necessary as it did not achieve a \nsolution to a problem \u2013 a finding similarly reported in the Scottish study of girls\u2019 violence (Burman, \nBrown, Tisdall and Batchelor 2002). 'I think you do that sort of thing when you're fifteen', fighting \n   \n \n24\n \n'wouldn't look good', 'it's childish', or 'it's immature' were among the comments of the interviewees. \nThus, both school bullying and physical fighting were regarded as activities unworthy of more \nmature young women. The incongruence of maturity and perpetrating violence has been similarly \nnoted by pupils in explaining why bullying is less prevalent among older pupils (see Thompson and \nArora 1991). \n \nThis new way of thinking about the use of physical aggression may well have been related to a \nreduction in the impact that pressure from peers had. It can also be speculated that the young \nwomen were being socialised out of using aggression - particularly that involving physical force - as a \nmeans of solving disputes with other young people. This was articulated as being about maturing, \nand it is certainly likely that petty disputes or attacks on personal status or integrity would be less \ncommon as they grew older. It may also have indicated an end to adolescent risk-taking behaviour \naimed at challenging authority.  \n \nIt is equally possible that the young women were becoming more aware of societal pressures on \nthem to become more passive and feminine, or alternatively to be assertive through verbal means, \nbut without resorting to physical violence. This 'swapping' of aggression for femininity was indeed \nsuggested by some of the respondents. It was noted, for example, that as girls got older they wanted \nto look attractive for boys, and it is the importance of obtaining a boyfriend which prevents them \nfrom using physical aggression. One student, for example, suggested that: \n \n   \n \n25\n \n[girls] are more sensible I think. They want to keep their faces... you don't look very \npretty when you are going round with a black eye, do you?... I think it is unattractive \nto actually be in a fight because it looks tomboyish, it probably looks a bit boyish, a \nbit sort of manly and ... in front of blokes girls like to be seen as, sort of like, nice \npretty young ladies...  (Jan) \n \nAnother student, Rehana, noted that her boyfriend had told her that he wanted to 'go out with a \nlady, not a bloody lunatic, hooligan, gangster'. Tentative support is found for a process, whereby \napproaching young adulthood, girls refrain from engaging in physical aggressive acts, as they learn \nthat it is no longer socially acceptable for them to do this. However, it was not always easy for the \nyoung women to articulate this subtle, ongoing process of checking their own behaviour against \nwhat is seen to be 'normal', adult - that is, feminine behaviour. For the majority, this process was still \nongoing at the time of the interview.  \n \nThis process of \u2018doing gender\u2019 stands in direct contrast to our knowledge about violence by girls in \nUS street gangs. Messerschmidt (1997), for example, argues that girls engaged in gang violence are \nnot simply \u2018doing masculinity\u2019. Rather, they are doing \u2018bad girl femininity\u2019 which involves nurturing a \nreputation for violence, street fighting, and defending the \u2018hood\u2019 (atypical gender practices), \nalongside pride in physical appearance, child care and the ability to attract male gang members \n(typical gender practices). Likewise, Archer (1998) draws on press and police information in \ndiscussing African Caribbean girl gangs in London, arguing that their feminine dress style and \n   \n \n26\n \nappearance are central to their identity as female gang members. This is also evident in the work of \nJoe Laidler and Hunt (2001) which draws out the links between femininity, violence, and \nrespectability in their research on ethnic gangs in San Francisco. This work highlights the negotiation \nof a position within gang structures which is itself constrained by patriarchal environments and \nstructural positions in society. \n   \nIn the current research, the swapping of aggression for femininity among the young women also \nneeds to be considered alongside our understanding of desistance which comes from bullying and \nself-report offending research. Glover et al. (2000) report, for example, that there is a fall in reported \nphysical bullying among girls and boys after Year 9 when pupils are aged 13-14 years, a finding \nwhich has been replicated in most studies of bullying (see Smith, Madsen and Moody 1999 for a \nfuller discussion of the age decline in being bullied). However, Glover et al. found that the fall in \nschool-based bullying was associated with an increase in out-of-school incidents. Self-report studies \nhave shown that desistance from offending may occur abruptly and consciously for young women \nfollowing life events such as leaving school, home, forming stable partnerships and having children \n(Graham and Bowling 1995). It is conceivable that as they grew older, the young women in the \ncurrent study, gained self-esteem and worth from other sources, such as personal relationships and a \ncareer, making the less constructive route of perpetrating violence unnecessary. \n \n \n \n   \n \n27\n \nImplications for theory, policy and practice \n \nMuch of the masculinities literature has concerned itself with the central role of violence in the \ndevelopment of hegemonic masculinity (see Connell 2002 for a recent review). The body of work \nreviewed in this paper makes clear the need to acknowledge that violence may well serve a function \nin the world of young women too, and not just those officially defined as violent (Messerschmidt \n1997; Joe Laidler and Hunt 2001). As Davies (1999: 87) observed in exploring gang violence \ninvolving young women in late Victorian times, they \u2018also featured as both perpetrators and victims \nin sufficient numbers to suggest at least some blurring of the association of toughness and fighting \nprowess with masculinity\u2019. This chimes with one of the central tenets of this paper, evidence for \nwhich is presented from an extensive literature conducted across disciplines and tentative findings \nfrom a small-scale exploratory study. These sources have in common the finding that there is a \nnormalised, routinised, legitimised conception and experience of violence in the lives of young \npeople \u2013 girls and boys. \n \nWhile the notion of 'normal violence' is useful for conceptualising the bullying and fighting engaged \nin by girls, the task of explaining the girls\u2019 \u2018atypical\u2019 behaviour remains. From a feminist perspective, \nthe use of aggression by girls is more difficult to interpret (Burbank 1994). Instead, feminist scholars \nand practitioners have tended to conceptualise girls' and women's aggression and violence as \noccurring in response to their own violent and sexual victimisation (Campbell 1984, 1981; Chesney-\nLind 1987; Fitzroy 2001; Baskin and Sommers 1998), avoiding discussion of women's anger and \n   \n \n28\n \naggression (Flax 1987; Fitzroy 2001). Criminologists too have failed to theorise women\u2019s occasional \nviolence (Shaw 1995; Messerschmidt 1997). As Allen (1998) notes, this \u2018rendering them harmless\u2019 \nhas the effect of denying women agency, prioritising pathological explanations for individual violent \nbehaviour, and leaving unexplained and under-theorised the complexities of female violence (see \nalso Miller 2001 in relation to girl gangs).  \n \nThe findings from the current research cannot easily be conceptualised within the victim or \nindividual pathology dichotomy. The data did not support the girls' use of aggression in response to \ntheir own victimisation. Furthermore, the commonality of aggression and violence in the girls\u2019 lives \nindicated more than pathological behaviour among a few, particularly since such behaviour at school \nwas not considered socially unacceptable. This raises some important questions for a feminist \nanalysis of girls' aggression and violence. For example, are we witnessing in the behaviour of girls at \nschool, a transformation of traditional gender-appropriate behaviour? Campbell (1981) has \nsuggested that social attitudes towards the behaviour of girls and women have changed in the post-\nwar period, allowing them the freedom to behave in overtly aggressive ways. This change in attitudes \nhas occurred because women are experiencing greater economic and social independence from men, \nand they are engaging with adolescent boys at a younger age where they may learn lessons on how to \nbe aggressive. A study of Finnish girls certainly shows some support for an 'emancipation' from \ntraditional gender roles for girls. Viemer\u00f6 (1992) found that girls' attitudes towards the use of \naggression changed in the 1990s to being seen in a more positive light than in  \n \n   \n \n29\n \nthe 1980s; as in the current study, aggressive behaviour among girls was associated with being \npopular, dominant, and having a positive self-image.  \n \nAn equally thorny issue for feminists is that much aggressive behaviour by girls serves to oppress \nother girls as a  result of their intense competition - frequently over boys or men (see also Burbank \n1987; Lees 1986, 1993). This oppression of girls by other girls is at its starkest when we consider the \nway in which girls censure other girls' sexual behaviour, according to sexist notions of appropriate \nbehaviour.  \n \nHowever, before we embrace the notion of an emancipation from some aspects of gender-\nappropriate behaviour for girls and women, it is important to recognise that the research findings \nalso indicate that girls' use of physical aggression during adolescence is a transitory experience, \nperhaps before social pressures to conform to traditional norms of gender-appropriate behaviour \nkick in. In addition, there is little statistical evidence to support a substantial increase in the \ninvolvement of women in violent crime, a probable corollary of their release from having to behave \nin gender-appropriate ways (Home Office 2001; Smart 1979; Carlen 1988).  \n \nThe challenge for future feminist and criminological research, as Chesney-Lind (1987) observes, will \nbe to formulate a coherent analysis of female aggression and violence which takes account of sex \ndifferences in personality, structural position, victimisation and socialisation. To this should be \nadded an exploration of the social control and conformity of girls within school and community \n   \n \n30\n \nsettings, paying particular attention to social class and ethnicity. A comparison with those girls who \ndo not 'mature out' of using physical aggression and who may become enmeshed in the welfare and \ncriminal justice systems, as well as the timing of desistance and its relationship to maturational \nprocesses, would contribute significantly to our understanding of the relationship between \nfemininity, aggression and violence. This should also enable theorising about aggression and \nviolence by girls without an over-reliance on explanations proposed to explain male behaviour \n(White and Kowalski 1994; Fitzroy 2001; Burman, Batchelor, and Brown 2001), or on individualistic \nexplanations that define such behaviour as pathological (Carlen 1988; Campbell 1993), but which \ncan recognise the similarities and differences in male and female behaviour (Miller 2001).  \n \nBearing in mind the rates of officially recorded violence by girls and women, and the apparent \ntransience of adolescent violence (at least among girls), it is clearly inappropriate to advocate or \nrecommend policy change based on these research findings. Indeed, vigilance is required in \ndocumenting and challenging the increasingly oppressive policing and criminalisation of girls who \nare officially defined as violent (see Worrall 2001). Nonetheless, there may be lessons for \npractitioners such as teachers. The school bullying literature has drawn attention to the deleterious \neffects of verbal, indirect and physical bullying on academic performance, health and well-being, and \nnoted the link between bullying and adult criminality. Thus, attempts to reduce school bullying must \nacknowledge the ways in which girls physically and psychologically intimidate, bully and exclude \neach other. Consideration will need to be given to providing support where the trigger is a \nbreakdown in friendship relations, as well as to increasing the resources available to girls (and boys) \n   \n \n31\n \nin the lowest echelon of the school pecking order, to assist them in resisting and countering \nintimidation and bullying. That aggressive behaviour may be part of the maturation process and the \ndevelopment of a constructive self-identity, and has a ritualistic nature which limits the harm \nincurred, should not obscure the finding that aggression and violence has a taken-for-granted nature. \nThis must surely be a cause for concern, so that challenging the apparent legitimacy that aggression \nand violence has for young people should be an overarching objective in any intervention.    \n \n   \n \n32\n \nReferences \n \nAllen, H.
