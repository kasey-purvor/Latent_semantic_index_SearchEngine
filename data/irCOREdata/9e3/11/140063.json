On the one hand, the need for\nsimilarity causes us to actively search for unity and certainty, while in parallel, we\nlook to create contrast and challenge. Because choice-making requires a preference\ntoward one of these two ends, humans tend to view the world in one of the two ways:\nthose predisposed toward a Theta worldview seek affiliation and control (unity and\ncertainty) while those with a Lambda worldview seek differentiation and challenge\n(contrast and challenge).\nApplying this framework to leadership, Theta leaders seek to build consensus within\ntheir peer group, from whom they derive confirmation of their past decisions as well\nas their values. On the other hand, Lambda leaders seek peers who challenge their\nviews and help them make innovative decisions. Thetas believe that a leader is born\nand is driven by emotions and social skills that are natural and subconscious.\nLambdas, however, see leadership as something which develops over time through\nlearning new lessons and achieving tangible results.\nAs a result, well-structured organisational governance must allow leaders to follow\ntheir chosen Theta\/Lambda worldview while helping them recognise the importance\nthat others may have come to different conclusions. Doing this requires empathy and\ntaking responsibility for others, rather than a strict set of rules.\nThe lessons analysed here have implications for the management of organisational\nconflict as well as the development of ethical and long-term successful business\nstrategies.\nIntroduction\nRecently, an award-winning article (Collis and Rukstad, 2008) advocated building a\nstrong strategy statement, which consists of an objective, a scope and a clear\n4advantage. While the authors recognise components such as mission, vision and\nvalues, they claim that these components will not drive the business.\nHowever, a strategy statement that is not clearly embedded in ethical values is\ndangerous, since it might lead to the destruction of organisations (Ashforth et al.,\n2008) and psychologically endanger the practitioner (Diamond and Allcorn, 1984;\nFrankl, 1986). Moreover, while having a clear strategy statement is a necessity, a\nmounting body of empirical (Collins, 2001; Collins and Porras, 2005; Gilkey and\nKilts, 2007) and theoretical (Mostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2009b) literature\nreveals that viewing the financial results of an organisation as the goal and all the rest\nas the means of achieving is a wrong practice. Such a practice eventually fails in the\nlong run as evidenced by the most recent financial crisis, although though many still\nbelieve otherwise.\nEven when the corporate landscape has been changed in the post-financial crisis and\nmore organisations have become aware of their social responsibility, fundamental\nlogic has not really changed (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2007b) as CSR continues to\nbe practiced as a means to a an end, rather than as a goal in its own right (Mostovicz,\nKakabadse and Kakabadse, 2009b).\nMostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse (2009b) explained the reasons for the failure of\nCSR approaches to render organisations more ethical since those approaches are\nbased on logic while ethics calls for the emotional involvement of the actor. They\nargued that low-level tactical behaviours have substituted for genuine reform without\nsolving the contradictions between the shortened timeframes of shareholder interest\nand longer-term CSR objectives. Mostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse (2009b)\ncalled for a complete change of course where leaders and their organisations search\nfor internally held values, using the business setting as a means. While Mostovicz et\nal. (2009b) outlined the ideal picture of a leader searching for his internal values, they\ndid not offer insights into the neglect of leadership when executives rely on rules and\nregulations instead of practicing their leadership. Building further on Mostovicz et\nal.\u2019s (2009b) argument that leadership is not a hierarchical position but the emotional\nability to follow one\u2019s worldview, the paper examines how this view of leadership\n5should be expressed in ethical corporate governance. This will done by reintroducing\nand developing on Mostovicz et al.\u2019s (2009b) Theta and Lambda framework.\nUsing the existing literature the paper outlines the Theta and Lambda framework upon\nwhich people make choices. It then applies this framework to three independent\nqualitative studies. The first study into luxury helps identify how the language that\nThetas and Lambdas use informs their choices. A second study, based on a wide range\nof interviews with top management (chairs, CEO\u2019s and similar), uses the tools\ndeveloped in the study into luxury to identify the ways which Theta and lambda act in\norganisations. The third study presents on-going research conducted in the US, one\naspect of which aims to identify cases of conflicts within organisations that have led\nto unethical behaviour and organisational destruction. While no final conclusions\nhave yet been drawn, the emerging results from over fifty participants shows that all\nconflicts arise from improper governance and can be described through the Theta \/\nLambda framework. This paper explains how these Theta\/ Lambda conflicts deprive\nchoice and it then reflects on what authentic governance should look like.\nHow do people choose?\nBinary choice or choosing between good and bad is easy. However, many of our\nchoices are between two equally good options and are based on what is desired or not,\naccording to a higher principle or value (Rawls, 1999). Kelly (1955), describing the\nmechanism of this choice, argues that it is based on two fundamental cognitive\ncomparing processes \u2013 contrast and similarity (Kelly, 1955). However, this comparing\nprocess is subjective and personal and it tends to form as dualities, rather than \u2018an\nencyclopaedia of antonyms\u2019 (Landfield, 1976). As a result, Landfield (1976:138)\ndefines contrast in meaning to be \u201ca personal awareness of a striking important\ndifference, a type of difference which implies the possibility of polar opposition or\nconflict; that one pole of a difference may either cancel out or balance the other one;\nand that the contrasting poles can be linked together or be combined in some way\u201d.\nHis definition suggests that the criteria for contrast are meaningfulness, polar\noppositeness and a duality of togetherness or interdependency.\n6Following Kelly (1955), Landfield (1976) notes that the nature of our interpretive\nprocess is paradoxical. On the one hand, the need for similarity causes us to actively\nsearch for unity and certainty, while in parallel, we look to create contrast and\nchallenge. Theology (i.e. the science of things divine) deals with an ideal whose\npursuit paradoxical since it is unreachable. This paradoxical approach is the\nfoundation of Jewish thought, for example (Kaplan, 1979; Kaplan, 1990), and can\nalso be found in Shinto, which calls for a dual process of improvement and progress\nthat are known as \u2018renovation and maintenance\u2019 (shuri kosei) and \u2018creation and\ndevelopment\u2019 (seisei kaiku) (Yamakage, 2000).\nHowever, in practice, one cannot hold the stick in both ends; either the two options\nare similar or they are contrasting. Man cannot identify both qualities at the same time\nand inclines either towards unity and certainty or toward contrast and challenge.\nExamining many domains of knowledge reveals the same phenomenon. In\npsychology, Gibson (1970) and Singer (1966) focus on man\u2019s search for consistency\nand certainty, while Rychlak\u2019s (1968) point of departure is man\u2019s oppositional and\nsubjective nature.\nThis duality can also be found in research into leadership and especially into\nauthenticity (Mostovicz and Kakabadse, 2009a), into business ethics (Mostovicz and\nKakabadse, 2008), into citizenship (Mostovicz and Kakabadse, 2009b), into the\ntheory of knowledge (Korac-Kakabadse, Kakabadse and Kouzmin, 2003; Mostovicz,\n2008), into corporate social responsibility (CSR) (Mostovicz, Kakabadse and\nKakabadse, 2008) and into luxury (Mostovicz, 2010).\nIn each of the domains described above, it is clear that people\u2019s choice is based either\non the preference for unity and certainty, which we call Theta (\uf04c), or the preference \nfor challenge and contrast, which we call Lambda (\uf04c). Hence, people choose one side \nof the paradox over the other. Mostovicz (2008) posits these choices reflect a person\u2019s\nworldview, or the way they go about discovering their \u201cideal self\u201d (Hinkle, 1965).\nTheta and Lambda worldviews have their unique characteristics. While Thetas are\nsocially motivated and look to affiliate with their society of choice (Pyszczynski,\nGreenberg and Solomon, 1997; Pyszczynski et al., 2004), Lambdas are individually\n7motivated (Deci and Ryan, 2000) and seek to differentiate themselves from others.\nThe respective behaviour of Thetas and Lambdas follows the fundamental modalities\nof human existence (Bakan, 1966). Thetas\u2019 inclination is toward communion and is\nfocused on other people and relationships while Lambda\u2019s behaviour is oriented\ntoward agency and focused on the self and autonomy.\nThus, Thetas and Lambdas also pursue different benefits and outcomes. While Thetas\ntry to build respect within their society of choice, Lambdas look for personal freedom\n(Mostovicz, 2008). In terms of how they relate to authenticity, Thetas are concerned\nwith truthfulness and denounce fakes (Ciulla, 2004; Nanus, 1995; Pyszczynski,\nGreenberg and Solomon, 1997; Pyszczynski et al., 2004), while Lambdas \u201care\ngenuine and authentic, not a replica of someone else\u201d (George et al., 2007:129) and\nperceive authenticity as uniqueness, with negative views of a \u201cme too\u201d practice\n(Bennis, 2004; Deci and Ryan, 2000; George et al., 2007; Ryan and Brown, 2003).\nFinally, the different worldviews have different ideas about what a true goal is.\nAccording to Kaplan (Kaplan, 1990), one relates to truth either as an objective or as a\nprinciple. If one relates to truth as an objective, the goal is to unite with that truth, as\nthe Thetas perceive (Mostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2009b). If, on the other\nhand, one relates to truth as a principle, as a Lambda does (Mostovicz, Kakabadse and\nKakabadse, 2009b), truth then creates a set of challenges or guidelines to live up to.\nTable 1 below outlines several of the characteristics which define these two\nworldviews.\nTable 1: Characteristics of Theta (\uf051\uf029 and Lambda (\uf051) worldviews \n Theta (\uf04c) Lambda (\uf04c) \nMotivation\/reason Socially-oriented Personally-oriented\nGoal Seeking unity and\ncertainty\nSeeking challenge and\ncreation\nBehaviour Communion Agency\nBenefit Building respect Looking for personal\nfreedom\nAuthenticity Truthfulness Genuineness\nInclination Toward choice Toward contrast\nPerception of truth As an objective As a set of rules\nSource: Mostovicz et al. (2009b; 2008)\n8Negative attitude\nPreferred Non-preferred pole\nPositive attitude\nWhy choosing is difficult\nWhile ideal interpretation is practically impossible since the cognitive process is\nparadoxical, people still use the two building blocks of cognitive comparison \u2013\nsimilarity and contrast, brushing away the paradoxical nature of such a process. In\nother words, on the one hand, people prefer one good option over the other while, on\nthe other hand, hold a positive attitude toward their choice while having a negative\nattitude toward the rejected choice.\nBy placing these two dimensions of preference and attitude in relation to each other,\nFigure 1 illustrates how the mechanism of human interpretation might be\ncompromised. The horizontal preference dimension is based on personal inclination\nand indicates the alternative courses of action, which consist of preferred and non-\npreferred poles (Kelly, 1955). The vertical attitudinal dimension, with its positive and\nnegative attitudes as polar extremes, shows the logical reasons for the corresponding\nattitudes (Kelly, 1955).\nFigure 1: The mechanism of human interpretation and how it is used.\nSource: Mostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse (2008)\n9The thin diagonal arrow in Fig. 1 represents the way people choose the quadrants they\nuse for interpretation when contrast is the overruling choice. In such a case, people\ntend to see phenomena in a biased and subjective way, selecting only two out of the\nfour quadrants. On the one hand, they identify the positive attitudinal elements of\ntheir preferred pole and, on the other hand, this positive attitude spontaneously\ninduces a negative attitude to the non-preferred pole (Mostovicz, Kakabadse and\nKakabadse, 2008).\nThe combination of choice between two good options and attitude, which imply\nchoosing a good option over a bad one, is a paradoxical undertaking when both\napproaches are applied to the same construct, perceiving the non-preferred pole as\n\u2018good\u2019 and as \u2018bad\u2019 simultaneously. To avoid this paradox, people tend to prefer one\ndimension over the other. Vince and Broussine (1996), for example, suggest that\npeople often use the contrast to their choice in order to define what their preferred\npole is not, whereas Pattakos and Covey (2004) argue that people adopt a positive\nattitude toward their preferred pole and a negative one toward their non-preferred\npole. However, choosing contrast over preference is using logic for justifying a\npersonal preference, which is not a result of logic contemplation but of personal\ninclination.\nConsequently, the choice process becomes distorted. In particular, we might be aware\nof what our choice is but since the other option is unknown to us we tend to forget\nthat it exists and what was an interpretation represents now an ultimate truth (Kegan\nand Lahey, 2001).\nLambdas, who seek contrast, select the positive attitude quadrant of their preferred\nchoice and contrast it with the negative attitude quadrant of the choice they rejected,\ndisregarding the two other quadrants (Mostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2008).\nThis distortion is called the learning paradox (Lewis, 2000), which entails processes\nsuch as sense-making, innovation and transformation. The distortion arises when\nindividuals have a clear purpose without realising that others might have an equally\nclear yet different purpose as well. This distortion is manifested when changes occur\nsuch that beliefs and assumptions cannot withstand the test of time (Cannon, 1996).\nBecause of the newness of the situation, when past experience cannot be applied, the\n10\ndistortion rises from fear of imperfectability (Pinker, 2003) or the belief that it may\nprove impossible to attain an ultimate solution. This distortion creates frustration and\nfear as it decreases the total meaning and significance of the person\u2019s life (Hinkle,\n1965).\nOn the other hand, Thetas who look for comparison would have the same attitude\ntowards the two possible choices, choosing either the two positive or the two negative\nquadrants leading to two possible distortions. The first, called the organising\nparadox (Lewis, 2000) involves the tension between conflicting needs for control and\nflexibility. In the case, the subject sees only the positive, conflicting quadrants and the\ntension that the paradox causes leads to paralysis (Kegan and Lahey, 2001) \u2013 the\ninability to choose between two goods. In this case, the individual is aware of the\nexistence of alternative subordinate constructs, but since he lacks true personal\npurpose, he is unable to prioritise them in accordance with his own preferences. The\nreason for such distortion is the fear of nihilism (Pinker, 2003) or the deep belief in a\nlife of meaning and purpose. In everyday language, this suggests, \u201cIf all choices are\nequally valid, what\u2019s the point of choosing?\u201d Here, the individual is aware of the\nexisting paradox but lacks the appropriate tools or mental models to cope.\nThe other distortion is called the belonging paradox and focuses on the conflicts of\nindividuals\u2019 identification and affiliation between the \u2018self\u2019 and the \u2018other\u2019 (Smith and\nBerg, 1987). In this case, the individual is unable to choose when both poles, or\noptions, seem equally bad. Thus they find themselves in a \u2018damned if I do, damned if\nI don\u2019t\u2019 type of conflict giving rise to helplessness and anger. This distortion is a\nreflection of the fear of determinism (Pinker, 2003) or loss of autonomy, that one is\nnot in control of his own choices. In this case, the person sees both choices as\nnegatively biased. The belonging paradox arises from the false belief that the goal of\nultimate truth has been reached or that a paradox has been resolved (Mostovicz,\n2008). As a result, the purpose the person adopts is false, not aspirational enough and\nweakly supported. In this case, anxiety rises as one confronts events outside one\u2019s\nrange of convenience (Kelly, 1955). The three distortions of paradox can be found\nboth in individuals and in organisational life (Mostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse,\n2008). Table 2 sums up the above discussion.\n11\nTable 2: The three types of internal cognitive conflict\nType of\nparadox\nCause of\ntension\nType of\ntension\nType of fear Type of\ntension\nmanagement\nQuadrants selected\nLe\nar\nni\nng\nLack of\nconsciousness\nFrustration and\nfear\nImperfectability Social\nreframing\nO\nrg\nan\nis\nin\ng Lack of purpose Helplessness\nand anger\nDeterminism Dynamic\nequilibrium\nB\nel\non\ngi\nng\nFalse purpose Paralysis Nihilism Social\nacceptance\nSource: adapted from Mostovicz et al. (2008).\nThe above discussion provides a picture of how interpretation is distorted. However,\npeople try to get out of this frustration and want to approach life properly according to\ntheir worldview. In other words, people constantly seek to enhance their self-esteem\n(Deci and Ryan, 2000; Pyszczynski et al., 2004). The question is, therefore, how one\ngoes about monitoring such patterns of choice-making behaviour? If governance is a\ncontinuous monitoring process of the choices people and organisations make, how can\ngovernance be made to be driven by a respect for people\u2019s personal ethics?\nTo answer this question, we need first to see how people enhance their self-esteem.\nWe do so by examining one tactic adopted for this enhancement - the use of luxury\n(Bonsu and Belk, 2003).\nUnderstanding choice-making through the consumption of luxury\nParadoxically, luxury is actually defined by its lack of necessity (Roux and Floch,\n1996) or as a \u201cneedless need\u201d (Mostovicz, 2010). As reflected in the psychology\nliterature, luxury appears to address our demand for self-esteem (Epstein, 1980), and\nit thrives on our symbolic use of products (Kassarjian, 1971) as a means of satisfying\nour life\u2019s core needs (Schneider and Bowen, 1999). People also use luxury as a\n12\ndefence when their self-esteem is under attack (Pyszczynski, Greenberg and Solomon,\n1997). Research by Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton (1982) shows how a\nperson uses \u201cthings\u201d to reinforce his personal values when threatened socially.\nBecause the \u201cneedless\u201d aspect of luxury implies choice, Mostovicz (2008)\nhypothesised that the way people use luxury would reflect their worldviews, being\neither Theta or Lambda. Fifty semi-structured, means-end laddering (Reynolds,\nGutman and Fiedler, 1985; Reynolds and Gutman, 1988) interviews were conducted\nin Europe, the US and Israel during 2003-2006. Each interviewee was asked to\nidentify a luxury of his choice and then asked to identify the attributes which that\nproduct embodies. The interviewer was allowed to express clearly the level of\nabstraction to which the interviewee should refer (Mostovicz and Kakabadse, 2009c)\nand was able to reconcile their answers according to their Theta or Lambda\nworldview. In retrospect, a full \u201cdictionary\u201d for diagnosing interpretive preferences\ncould be created after interviewing only half of the sample.\nMostovicz (2008) used the motivational approach to means-end laddering (Mostovicz\nand Kakabadse, 2009c), in line with Hinkle\u2019s (1965) recommendation. The\nmotivational approach provides a sound theoretical basis and a practical, replicable\noutcome that is difficult for the cognitive structure approach (Grunert, 1995) to\nachieve. Means-end laddering encourages subjects to provide free associations which\nare then sorted into four levels of abstraction: attributes, benefits, emotional rewards\nand values (de Chernatony, 2001). Following Harr\u00e9 (1995; 1995), language is treated\nas functional (it does things) rather than neutrally descriptive, or a window to a\nperson\u2019s inner truth. Therefore, instead of comparing semantic labels, the\nmotivational approach compares contextual meaning.\nReaching the highest level of abstraction \u2013 values \u2013 is not always possible since\npeople find it difficult to express themselves clearly and require the use of metaphors\nand analogies to communicate (Feixas, Geldschlaeger and Neimeyer, 2002). Hinkle\n(1965) shows clearly that people reflect on their life motivations in one of two ways\nonly, either through achievement or association. Equally, the Theta \/ Lambda\ntemplates seem to be uninfluenced either by time, place or any socio-demographic\nvariable (Mostovicz, 2008; Mostovicz and Kakabadse, 2009c).\n13\nThe way that ladders are produced reflects the way individuals interpret their own\nbehaviour. Like all interpretations, ladders actually represent the hierarchical structure\nof interpretation. Results could be divided into two groups based on the Theta and\nLambda worldviews. When laddered further, the two worldviews actually had\ndistinctive responses at each level, looking for different benefits, personal rewards\nand, of course, values. Table 3 represents the categorisation at higher levels, which\nthe data was sufficient enough to provide.\nTable 3: The conceptual differences between the two worldviews along each level of the ladder\nLevel Theta (\uf04c) Lambda (\uf04c) \nAttributes Personal impression Tangible, concrete and\nquantitative\u2014product focus;\nhaving things\nBenefits Social \u201cMore\u201d, challenge\nEmotional rewards Recognition \u2013 who I am Achievement \u2013 what I did\nValues Confirmation \u2013 experiential\nvalues\nJoy \u2013 creative values\nSource: Mostovicz (2010)\nAttributes describe the elements that people use to communicate, or the elements they\nuse for expressing themselves. At this level, the assumptions that Thetas make are\nmore implicit and refer to the beliefs that they perceive to be commonly held by their\npeer group. They are aware that these assumptions are personal and subjective. On the\nother hand, the Lambdas rely on their personal view and use an objective language,\nwhich is tangible, concrete and ultimately even measurable.\nNevertheless, as individuals, we do not relate to all available data (Kahneman, Slovic\nand Tversky, 1982; Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) and so pick up either those pieces\nof data that are considered independently novel or those which we can readily add to\nour existing knowledge (Korac-Kakabadse, Kakabadse and Kouzmin, 2003). Since\nLambdas seek challenge and novelty, they identify concretely new data which they\nconsider useful for their interpretation. For Thetas, they tend to pick out those pieces\nof data that can be added to their existing personal picture and sense of unity.\nAt the level of benefit, the data (or attributes) are organised to provide a rationale for\nthe selection of the attributes. The benefits that Thetas look for are of the social type.\n14\nThese speak to their relationship with the environment: about how they can address it,\naffect it more successfully, and impose their status more successfully. On the other\nhand, the benefits that challenge-oriented Lambdas get from luxury are of a more\npersonal flavour. Luxury honours the fact that they faced a challenge successfully, or\nit enriches them by providing or reminding them of key personal moments. Therefore,\nThetas (who look for enrichment of their existing knowledge) look for benefits that\nimprove their social standing whereas Lambdas, who look for novel challenges,\njustify the attributes selected as those which can most improve their personal\nrepertoire of interpretation or expression.\nThe third level of the ladder \u2013 the emotional reward \u2013 represents a shift from the\nproduct itself to the interpretation of how the processed data is made relevant to one\u2019s\npersonality. The two types differ in the emotional awards they look for when\ninvesting in luxury. Thetas look for recognition; they want to be loved, appreciated\nand recognised. They want to find a social environment within which they can\npositively assess \u2018who they are\u2019. Lambdas, on the other hand, look to\ncompartmentalise the past and discover new challenges, while Thetas look for\nrewards that will accentuate and enrich their existing positions and connect these to\nthe future.\nThe Theta and Lambda worldviews also elicit different value-sets at the fourth level\nof the ladder, the interpretation of one\u2019s life purpose. The values that are important for\nThetas are that of (social) confirmation. They want society to confirm that they are\nplaying properly, according to the norms they admire. This drive for social\nconfirmation is evident in research into Terror Management Theory (TMT)\n(Pyszczynski, Greenberg and Solomon, 1997; Pyszczynski et al., 2004). According to\nTMT, people look to be part of a social group as a means of avoiding their fear of\ndeath. To this end, Thetas look to be recognised as good followers of the rules which\ntheir chosen group has adopted. Alternatively, Lambdas look for a more personal set\nof values, which are based on pride, personal satisfaction and personal expression.\nThis drive is the cornerstone of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (Deci and Ryan,\n2000). Lambdas appreciate the act of creation that brings them joy (Bergson, 2007).\n15\nThe value level may be considered the most synthesised mode of interpretation,\nreflecting the best personality of the interpreter. Thus, Lambdas draw joy from new\ncreations, while Thetas gain satisfaction from enriching present experiences.\nWhile ladders tend to converge as they reach higher levels of abstraction (Grunert and\nGrunert, 1995), the analysis of results confirms the taxonomy of attributes of luxury\nas presented in various works (Kapferer, 1998; Vigneron and Johnson, 1999;\nVigneron and Johnson, 2004). In particular, this study adopts the six attributes that\nDubois, Laurent and Czellar (2002) propose, namely: extreme quality, rarity, aesthetic\nappeal, expensiveness, time incorporation and superfluousness. Nevertheless, since\nthese six attributes are used for communication and interpretation, Thetas or Lambdas\nwill still use them differently as Table 4 illustrates:\nTable 4: The ways the Thetas and the Lambdas relate to the six facets of luxury\nFacet Theta (\uf04c) Lambda (\uf04c) \nSuperfluousness is\u2026 Independence to choose the social\nsetting\nIndependence to choose the\nchallenge\nExtreme quality is\u2026 embedded in the product \u2013 natural\nfibres such as silk and linen\na man-made accomplishment\nExpensiveness is\u2026 \u201ca lot of money\u201d \u201cabove my budget\u201d\nRarity is\u2026 in the product \u2013 diamonds are rare in the person \u2013 \u201cit was difficult for\nme to find\u201d\nAesthetic appeal, or\npolysensuality is\u2026\nDescribed in an intangible,\nqualitative, subjective way which is\nembedded in the person\n\u201cFits me perfectly\u201d, \u201cPart of me\u201d, \u201cI\nfeel alive\u201d\nDescribed with a tangible, concrete\nand quantitative \u2013product focus\n\u201cPure\u201d, \u201clarge\u201d, \u201cwhite\u201d\nTime incorporation is\u2026 Product-related -timelessness \u2013 as\nin antiques\nProcess-related - a lot of time\ninvested\nSource: Mostovicz (2010)\nWhile the meaning of the answer is different to Thetas and Lambdas, their initial\nreactions and responses are similar: that it is needless.\nThe difference in the way that Thetas and Lambdas interpret luxury lies in their\npreferred means of enhancing self-esteem. As Thetas seek unity which has yet to be\nachieved, they refer to luxury by looking toward the future to define the goal they\nhope to reach. The luxury item is their companion in the journey toward this future.\nTherefore, they refer to quality as embedded in the product, as it will show this\n16\nextreme quality throughout the life of the luxury item. Rarity is equally embedded in\nthe product, which has intrinsic worth and will always be expensive. For the Theta,\ntime incorporation is forever; luxury is thus timeless. Expensiveness and aesthetic\nappeal depend on the person\u2019s interpretation of immutable value and the decision to\ninvest is based on the belief that these values will stay as such throughout the person\u2019s\nfuture life.\nOn the other hand, Lambdas refer to luxury through the lens of personal achievement\nor the prism of challenge. For them, the enhancement of self-esteem is grounded in\nthe past and based on their successful track record, and they view the luxury item as a\npersonal trophy. Quality is measured by the work invested in the item, and its rarity is\nbased on the time and effort needed to find it. Likewise, time incorporation is based\non the time invested in the past into the product. Equally, the aesthetic appeal of a\nluxury item is pre-determined and is not based on the owner\u2019s current relationship\nwith the item, nor its social resonance. For a Lambda, an object simply is or is not\naesthetically appealing; it cannot become so. Finally, expensiveness is based on a\npast-decided budget and is compared to past earning efforts.\nApplying choice-making patterns to leadership\nHowever, Mostovicz (2008) argued that since the above analysis is based on the way\npeople make choices, such an analysis should be applicable to all cases where a\nchoice is needed or human logic must be applied. Mostovicz et al. (2009b)\ndemonstrate how the choices of a leader follow the same Theta\/Lambda pattern.\nTo test whether leaders are similar to luxury users in using language patterns, sharing\ngoals and having concerns that follow the Theta\/Lambda patterns, Mostovicz,\nKakabadse and Kakabadse (2009a) examined a wide selection of semi-structured\ninterviews of top executives and board members. These interviews1 looked at the\nchoice pattern behaviour of leaders, especially during times of organisational change\nwhen leadership is better manifested (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2007a).\n1 Over fifty interviews were examined. Not all were suitable for the purpose of the study, either for\ntechnical reasons or because the interviews did not focus clearly on interpretation. As a result, about\n25% (12 interviews) were discarded.\n17\nExamining these interviews revealed that it was possible to analyse the way those\nexecutives talk about themselves using the same conceptual model that the study into\nluxury provided while adapting the six attributes (table 4) and making them more\nabstract and conceptual. The findings were consistent and clear, and not in one case\nwas the analysis doubtful.\nThe facets that comprise the building blocks of all interpretation are thus as follows:\n\uf0a7 Freedom: Freedom describes the inner drive for interpretation, or the passion of\nthe interpreter. While free choices flow from the interpreter\u2019s life goals,\nfreedom does not describe the goals per se but rather describe the innate drive\nfor interpretation that these goals precipitate.\n\uf0a7 Adaptors: The role of adaptors is to describe those attributes of the\ninterpretational subject which are represented to himself to achieve his passion.\n\uf0a7 Internalisation: Internalisation explains why certain tacet elements were\nselected for the fulfilment of the choice-drivers.\n\uf0a7 History: The notion of history describes the way the interpreter relates his\npassion to the changing narrative of the world outside.\n\uf0a7 Connectors: This facet describes those connective elements which are used for\nbuilding the relationship of the interpreter with the outside world of things.\n\uf0a7 Externalisation: similarly to internalisation, the role of this facet is to explain\nwhy certain explicit elements are chosen for expressing ideas over time\n(Mostovicz, 2008).\nTheta and Lambda relate differently to these six facets as follows (table 5). We added\nin italics the particular language style Theta and Lambda use when describing these\nattributes.\nTable 5: The interpretation facets of the Theta and Lambda\nAttributes Theta - \uf04c Lambda - \uf04c \nFreedom Select social setting Select challenges\nAdaptors\nCharacterise the ideal social setting\nDescribed in an intangible, qualitative,\nsubjective way.

They are not looking necessarily to have bright stars who can come\nwith brilliant ideas since they have to first create a proper social atmosphere around\nthem that would help them acting according to their worldview. Theta leaders are very\nconcerned with what their peers (i.e. other executives around them) think since they\nrely on a consensus to plot their way ahead. Since being a Theta leader implies that\none should be a better player within ones\u2019 society, such a person will be able to offer a\nrange of solutions to new problems that arise from change. Nevertheless, for a Theta\nleader, each team member complements each other and the way ahead is a joint\ndecision. Thetas believe that a good leader builds his recognition and good reputation\namong his social peers.\nIn building their team, Thetas tend to seek mutual respect and understanding by\nencouraging colleagues to speak out and come with ideas. Looking for consensus,\nThetas view directional leadership as wrong; they do not dictate, but rather, blend\ninfluences and opinions that enable them to reach a consensus. Nevertheless, since\nThetas are concerned with the possible weaknesses of their team, they have to follow\ntheir natural inclination, taking a step back and examining critically and objectively\nthe team\u2019s performance so they can recommend improvements. Acting against one\u2019s\nnatural inclination is manifested in what Thetas seek to acquire. Since Thetas are\nnaturally social, they seek to improve their intellectual abilities.\nThetas look for an improvement of their past experience. They tend to be conservative\nand risk averse, building on the continuation and development, and enrichment of\ntheir secured past with fresh ideas. Thus, since they believe that their past experience\n19\ncan predict what might happen, reviewing that past is important for them as they seek\nways to minimise necessary changes. However, solutions are usually novel and are\nnot part of the past knowledge portfolio.\nTo Thetas, the perception of truth is an objective or a goal. Therefore, they seek a\nclear and explicit structure that would explain this goal, follow a well defined plan to\nachieve it and ensure that everything is done properly, appropriately and\ncontinuously, thus improving in a well defined direction. Ideally, they would be\nhappy when everything is going absolutely fine but when facing a change, Thetas\nbelieve in one true solution. Failure to reach the solution shows that they were not\nfocused on target. Thetas use the best solution or goal approach, which is social in\nnature as an anchor or a vision that helps them face changes. However, the belief that\nonly one best solution exists means that a Theta uses logic based on his intellectual\nabilities. Thus, he trains and convinces his team to also embrace the \u201cone best\nsolution\u201d approach. Finally, Thetas believe that a leader is born; driven by emotions,\nhis social skills are natural and subconscious.\nOn the other hand, Lambdas address the same issues in an opposite way. Lambdas\nembrace change since it implies a fresh and a new challenge. For them, risk aversion\nis evading responsibility. Acting in a predicted environment is dull and boring so a\nchange injects life into the social setting. Following their Lambda worldview, Nonaka\nand Takeuchi (1995) describe how Japanese leaders have learned to welcome change\nand when it does not happen socially, they create it by looking for fluctuation and\ncreative chaos (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995). Fluctuation is different from complete\ndisorder and scholars define it as an order whose patterns are difficult to predict at the\nbeginning (Gleick, 1987). Fluctuation creates a breakdown of routine habits and\ncognitive framework that enables examining basic attitudes toward the world and it\ndemands that we turn our attention to dialogue as a means of social interaction as to\ncreate new concepts. We naturally create chaos when we face real crisis and the\napproach we currently take cannot find an adequate solution. In chaos, we do not\ndefine a problem to reach a solution; instead, we focus on the structure or the solution\nprocess. Nevertheless, the organisation should \u201creflect in action\u201d (Nonaka and\nTakeuchi, 1995).\n20\nNonaka and Takeuchi\u2019s (1995) succinct description of dealing with chaos may help us\nunderstand how Lambdas act. In the individualistic worldview of a Lambda, the\nmeaning of teamwork is different than that of a Theta. A Lambda is happy to listen to\ndifferent perspectives that would address the challenge from other angles. A Lambda\nleader might not adopt any of the ideas raised by the team, but by respecting them, he\nwill be able to reshape and fine-tune his own perspective. Thus, he bases team\nselection not on an emotional basis, but on the ability of each to intellectually\nchallenge and fertilise the leader\u2019s imagination. When building a team, a Lambda is\nconcerned with the team\u2019s strength which will produce the best challenge. Such an\napproach might identify the champion of the day when addressing a challenge since\nthe team actually competes on who can better face the challenge. The full\nresponsibility lies on the leader\u2019s shoulders who must act genuinely and clearly\naccording to his worldview. Since the entire organisation would follow his dictum, a\nLambda should be aware that such hierarchical behaviour might block his team from\nexpressing fully their thoughts. Therefore, while against his natural inclination, a\nLambda should see his team members as equals and interact socially with them.\nJapanese managers learned how to deal with this problem. Japan is a hierarchical\nindividualistic society where a leader would take a personal responsibility that might\neven cost him his life (Nitobe, 1969). With such a high cost and to avoid harsh\nconsequences, the Japanese learned to spread responsibility on a larger team.\nNevertheless, acting as a team is in direct contrast to hierarchy. Therefore, when\nacting in a team, Japanese shed away all hierarchy to provide each with the necessary\nautonomy to express his ideas in the most honest way (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995).\nWhen people impose change, it is chaotic by nature; it is often difficult to figure out\nthe challenge and what type of change we should undertake, if any. Hence, a Lambda\nexcels when challenge grows in an unusual way, which requires an unexpected\nsolution. Leadership for a Lambda requires that the leader would be able to\nsuccessfully challenge his creative and knowledgeable team. Tapping into the creative\njuices of these people enables the leader to sharpen his own way ahead.\nSince change means newness, we should consider past experience carefully. Instead\nof looking for similarity, a Lambda looks for contrast \u2013 what was missing in the\n21\nexisting knowledge that caused him to see the new change as a challenge. Being new,\na Lambda does not look for a structured solution, but for a clear direction to head. A\nTheta might sense how the solution might look, but nevertheless, cannot express it\nexplicitly. Therefore, a Lambda might use metaphors (which Nonaka and Takeuchi\n(1995:66) define as \u201ca way of perceiving or intuitively understanding one thing by\nimaging another thing symbolically\u201d) or analogies. Since metaphors benefit from\nimages that seem unrelated at first sight (Morgan, 1980), a Lambda tends to read\nbeyond his immediate challenge boundaries, as if invading them, and strives to offer\nfresh perspectives. Driven by instinct, a Lambda argues that his solution is good, and\nacknowledges that other options exist. Therefore, he is able to impose his choice and\nattitude because of his strong personality and not because of his better logic. A\nLambda does not look for understanding, but for trust and enthusiasm of his peers. In\nachieving a goal, a Lambda proudly pronounces, \u201cI did it my way.\u201d\nSince the perception of truth for a Lambda is a set of rules, a Lambda is not looking\nfor a defined goal and his purpose is to define a set of rules that would move him in\nthe right direction (Neisser, 1976). In his eyes, breaching them is a failure. In the\nprocess of acting, a Lambda constantly changes his plan as he progresses. Therefore,\nhe tries to decipher the change and understand why the existing rules no longer work.\nHence, the individual Lambda does not reflect on future vision but on his own past\nexperience that defines a box to think outside of it so he would be able to reach a\ngenuine change. A Lambda leader continuously and consciously develops. He seeks\nchallenges, analyses them and learns a new lesson. However, a good solution usually\nreveals that the newness that the change brought was only a disguised old problem.\nRelating choice-making to organisational behaviour and luxury\nIn reality, many members of organisations suffer from low and even crushed self-\nesteem. As early as 1961, Austin (1961:53) commented that \u201cCodes of conduct\nimposed by statutes or by corporate statements of policy are external in character and\nare prohibitive in kind. They largely consist of \u2018Thou shalt not\u2019s - psychologically\nunsound and, by their very phrasing, creating an attitude of suspicion on the part of\nthe public.\u201d\nIn other words, corporate governance tried to change behaviour without paying\nattention to people\u2019s values. Moreover, since people are forced to act against their\n22\nvalues or worldviews, such behaviour can be financially harmful to the organisation\n(Collins, 2001; Collins and Porras, 2005; Jensen, 2002) and might damage the\npsychological integrity of the practitioner (Diamond and Allcorn, 1984).\nHence, by combining the results of the two studies discussed above, it is possible to\nrelflect on whether the inability to follow one\u2019s worldview or to have the freedom of\nmaking choices impacts one\u2019s self esteem and their ability to cope with this pressure\nthrough the use of luxury.\nSince the luxury customer has to overpay for something that is valueless to him,\nluxury behaviour is the antithesis of what we are accustomed to accept as economic\nlogic. Unfortunately, companies which offer products that can be used as luxury fail\nto understand this concept. Even the approach pursued in the marketing of diamonds\nsince 1939, which was based on sound luxury principles, was abandoned in 1980,\nbrought the diamond industry to a state of almost insolvency (Mostovicz, 2006;\nMostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2007). Other luxury producers did not fare\nbetter and even sales in Japan, which used to be the Mecca of luxury started to\ndecline. Possible explanation could be found in the comments of Mark Lee, Gucci\nCEO, who explained that the company\u2019s business strategy was geared toward creating\ngreater revenues and brand recognition through keeping potential customers in a store\nfor as long as possible. Lee commented that this business model is the same for all\nluxury brands and is geared toward causing the customers to spend more in the shop\n(Friedman, 2006). In short, Lee did not see a fundamental difference between luxury\nand any other commodity and claimed that the marketing practice should result in\nimproving the bottom-line of the marketer. Therefore, we initiated a piece of research\nto see whether proper marketing of luxury enhances the satisfaction of the customer\nas measured by the shop\u2019s financial success.\nTo assess whether our theoretical claim about enhancement of self-esteem through\nluxury is valid, we initiated several focus groups consisting mainly of people working\nin organisations. To date, more than fifty people have participated in this on-going\nstudy and at this stage we can present only preliminary results. We asked the\nattendants to explain how they cope with pressure in their organisation. We\nencouraged them to share their personal stories and even to comment on cases with\n23\nwhich they were familiar where the inability to cope with pressure led to the\ndestruction of the organisation or to self-destruction.\nTo date, all participants followed a similar pattern. All coped by expressing\nbehaviours associated with luxury, namely the needless squandering of assets such as\ntime, money or energy. This could be taking a day off, going on vacation or on a\nbuying spree, going for a workout instead of going home and spending time for\nthemselves instead of their spouses and children. Some acted by stopping to relate to\nthe pressure and shrugging off responsibility even when they knew that this might be\nharmful to the organisation. In other words, they decided to stop coping with pressure.\nAnother interesting finding was that in all cases the pressure was a result of having\nconflicting worldviews. People suffered not because they had to behave in a certain\nway but because they felt that their values had been disrepsected.\nOne interesting case was a research assistant (a Theta) who worked both for her\nprofessor and for us, getting Lambda-type directives. She was encouraged to work on\nher own initiatives and to come with her findings. While a Lambda would appreciate\nsuch freedom a Theta would feel alienated, threatened and isolated. Presenting her\nresults, she found out that they were never used. Upon telling her frustration with her\nprofessor, we commented that she had to experience the same when working with us,\nto which she answered, \u201cFrom you, it is different\u201d. The only difference was since we\nknew that she was working in a pressurred environment we made a point to relieve\nthat pressure. We recognised that she might find it difficult to work on her own\nwithout clear directives and when she came with results that were eventually rejected\nwe nonetheless made sure to show her how her work had inspired us.\nConclusive remarks\nHannah Arendt (1993) argues that authority operates between the extremes of\ncoercion and persuasion. Authority fails when people have to be forced to obey out of\nfear, and it equally fails when people continuously need to be persuaded to comply.\nShe concludes that organisations cannot function without the feeling that the force\nthey exercise is legitimate. In other words, this force has to be granted. The question\nis, therefore, what the source of authority is that organisations draw upon when\nimposing governance rules.\n24\nOur studies demonstrate not only how people choose but also how important this\nchoice is for them. Only through expressing their choice again and again, we can\nexpect people to become more ethical (Mostovicz, Kakabadse and Kakabadse,\n2009b). Hence, the role of top management is not to impose their point of view,\nwhether through coercion or by persuasion. Governance by rules reflects, at most, the\nworldview of the rules\u2019 creator but does not guarantee that the worldview and the\ndeep values of those affected by these rules has been respected. Increasingly,\ngovernance scholars and practitioners are recognising that in order to have effective\ngovernance, the \u2018rules are not enough\u2019 (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2007; Merson,\n2010).\nIf we want to protect our society and render it more ethical, we should learn to listen\nto the other\u2019s voice and to be careful to help the other enhance his own self-esteem.\nOur last study reveals that no one complained about that they were overruled. This is\nnatural in organisational life when decisions have to be taken. However, the constant\ncomplaint was that nobody was listening to them. Decision-makers have the right to\nmake their decisions for themselves but have to remember that these decisions are\nbased on their choice, which means that other options exist which may be very dear to\nothers. By showing empathy and by demonstrating that the other choice has equal\nmerit, we learn to respect and to listen to the other, which begs the question of\nwhether we really need to govern by rules.\n25\nReferences\nArendt, H. 1993, \"What is Authority?\" in Between Past and Future: Eight Exercises\nin Political Thought Penguin, New York, pp. 91-196.\nAshforth, B.E., Gioia, D.A., Robisnson, S.L. & Trevino, L.K. 2008, \"Re-Viewing\nOrganisational Corruption\", Academy of Management review, Vol. 33 No. 3, pp.\n670-684.\nAustin, R.W. 1961, \"Code of Conduct for Executives\", Harvard business review, Vol.\n39 No. 5, pp. 53-61.\nBakan, D. 1966, The Duality of Human Existence: Isolation and Communion in\nWestern Man Rand McNally, Chicago.\nBennis, W. 2004, \"The Crucibles of Authentic Leadership\" in The Nature of\nLeadership., eds.
