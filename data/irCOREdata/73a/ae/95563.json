This definition of family is mirrored in other \nnational contexts in terms of the way it excludes many familial type relationships \nbased on cultures, customs, and individual choices among people who are not related \nby birth, marriage, or adoption, such as unmarried same- or opposite-sex partners. The \ninstitution of family is supported by law in nearly every country, and governments \ntake effective regulatory measures to protect its integrity and the well-being of its \nmembers. However, the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 limits \nfamily members for whom employees may take leave to one\u2019s spouse, adopted, foster, \nor natural child, or parent. Notably, siblings, in-laws, grandparents, aunts and uncles, \nand others for whom one may provide care are excluded.  \nIn this manuscript, we take the perspective that definitions of \u201cfamily\u201d with \nrespect to work-family concerns should include others for whom workers care and \nwhom workers include in their support networks. Specifically, following Piotrkowski \n(1978, cited in Eby, Casper, Lockwood, Bordeaux & Brimley, 2005) we define family \nas a collective of two or more individuals who are in a relationship of interdependence \ntowards shared vision and goals. We suggest that employees should be allowed to \ndefine family in their own terms rather than being forced to accept the narrow \ndefinitions of family provided by American employment legislation. We argue that \nthe contemporary definitions of family in the context of work should be broadened to \ncapture a wider set of familial type relationships, and that organizations may derive \npotential benefits by allowing employees to define their own \u201cfamily\u201d in their own \nterms.  \n 3\nWe begin with a brief history of the construction of family and work in \nindustrialized countries. Next, we consider other researchers\u2019 calls for better \nconceptualization of family in the concept of work. We also offer our suggestions for \nsome areas that should be considered, including same-sex couples, multi-generational \nfamilies, and virtual families. We next discuss the consequences of using narrow \ndefinitions of family. Lastly, we make recommendations for change, including \nsuggestions for research and practice. Throughout the manuscript, while we focus on \ninadequacies in the U.S. law and organizations, we incorporate work and family \nconcerns from other areas.  \nA brief history of the construction of family and work in industrialized countries \nInternational consensus on definitions of work and family has been \nunderpinned by the politics of social life and industrialization (Weber, Giddens, & \nParsons, 2001) and with episodes of sea change in family structures across the post-\nindustrialized countries (Carnoy, 1999). As depicted and espoused in Parsonian \nsociology (Parsons, 1951), the functional family ideology served the engine house of \nindustrialization. The functional family ideology assigned different roles to women \nand men at work and home, along gendered lines. This separation meant that men \nwere assigned the role of breadwinners, who would go out to do paid work, whilst \nwomen were assigned unpaid domestic responsibilities and the care of children and \nthe elderly. This dominant ideology has meant that industrialization required the \nisolation of work and life domains; male laborers needed to draw on their family \nmembers\u2019 free domestic labor in order for them to remain at work for long hours. An \nearly example of this separation is the \u2018five dollar day\u2019 scheme introduced in Ford \nMotor Company in 1914. This scheme suggested that men could earn five dollars a \nday provided that they conform to a family ideal. One of the many paternalistic \n 4\ncriteria for a worker to earn five dollars per day was that the worker\u2019s wife should \nsupport him at work by looking after the home (Beynon, 1984).  \nIn the last three decades, however, this functional approach to the separation \nof work and family has been scrutinized and its adverse impacts on the constitution of \nsocial and work lives examined. Of particular interest to these explorations has been \nthe growth of dual income and single parent families, unmarried but co-habiting \nsame- and opposite-sex couples, and the extended families that remained outside the \nlegal and economic conceptualizations of family. Nuclear families, made up of a \nmarried heterosexual couple with children, upon whom the functional family ideology \nhas been founded, are no longer the dominant form of family in the industrialized \ncountries of today. In her study of working mothers in Malaysia, Ahmad (1996) \nsuggests that the separation of work and life along gender lines is no longer evident in \nmany non-Western countries either. Therefore, a broader range of logic now operates \nin modern societies in the social construction of family, which deems the definitions \nbased on matrimony, economics, and social mores alone to be inadequate.  \nThis is not a simple problem of definition, however. The legal, economic, and \nsocial definitions of family frame the institutional mechanisms by which the families \nare supported and sustained in advanced democracies. Therefore, the inadequacy of \nexisting definitions of family is imbued with often dire material consequences for \nindividuals whose conceptions of family are not aligned with these narrow legal, \neconomic, or social classifications.  \nThe process of industrialization has also accelerated the demarcation of work \nas paid work in the formal sector. This has led to work in the informal sector and the \ndomestic sphere (see Tuominen, 1994 for the case of care-giving work), as well as \nwork of unpaid nature (Lewis, 1997) or work which emanates from kinship or social \n 5\nties (Fletcher, 1999) to remain unrecorded and\/or undervalued and consequently fall \noutside the legal and economic conceptualizations of work. Limiting work to paid \nwork in the formal sector marginalizes and devalues the contributions of women \nwhose work largely remains in the informal sector or in the domestic sphere as unpaid \nfamily workers. Furthermore, Hochschild (1990, 1997) alerts us to the gendering of \nmuch unrecorded work and refers to \u2018second shifts\u2019 in relation to women\u2019s \ndisproportionate contribution to domestic labor and permeable boundaries between \nwork and home. Therefore, when we refer to the demands of work and family in this \npaper, we refer to \u2018work\u2019 in each case, as both family and work demand unpaid and \npaid work from its members. We propose to conceptualize both work and family \ndemands as work not only in recognition of the gendering process as outlined, but \nalso because the conception of work as limited to paid work in formal sectors of \nemployment means that the minority ethnic workers, workers with disabilities, or \nolder and younger workers, who are trapped outside or at the margins of the formal \neconomy, have remained largely outside the formal conceptions of work and the \nstructural benefits that work in the formal economy affords to its workers.  \nTherefore, defining work and family in this tapered way has not been an \ninnocuous practice of definition. Indeed, it is more sinister in reality as legal, \neconomic, and social framing of work and family predicts what types of work and \nfamily are legitimized and supported via the institutional mechanisms of social \neconomy and politics. A recent report funded by the European Union highlights how \ndifferent political regimes, gender cultures, and ethnic and class divisions impact on \nthe provision of family support policies in Bulgaria, Norway, the UK and Portugal \n(Nilsen & Brannen, 2005). Narrow definitions of work and family, once \ninstitutionalized, privilege certain groups whilst marginalizing the interests of others. \n 6\nPitt-Catsouphes and Christensen (2004) provide a review which seeks to unmask the \ntaken for granted assumptions of the work and family literature. In this paper, we \nexplore some of these taken for granted assumptions and the process of \nmarginalization, which characterizes the experience of non-traditional families, across \nthe fault lines of gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.  \nCalls for a better conceptualization of family in the context of work \nMany researchers have acknowledged the inadequacies in definitions of \n\u201cfamily\u201d used in research, among governmental agencies, and commonly accepted \namong the public. Suggestions to more accurately describe \u201cfamily\u201d include \nrecognition of additional family structures and of the cultural variability in the \nmeaning of family. For example, Voydanoff (1988, 2005) has called for a better \nreconceptualization of the work-family field, to include non-paid work and non-\ntraditional family structures. At present, the common understanding of family in the \nU.S. is based on the \u201cnuclear\u201d model of a heterosexual married couple, living with \ntheir children in a household headed by the husband (Rothausen, 1999). This may \nhave been the dominant form of family in decades past (although this point has been \ndebated; see Coontz, 1991). However, the demographic structure of American \nfamilies has changed significantly in recent years, with increasing divorce rates and \nsingle-parent households (Fields, 2003). The nuclear model is no longer viable as the \ndefault American family structure.  \nEvolving definitions of family include people who may not be kin, but who act \nas family for some individuals (Rothausen, 1999). Bogan (1991) uses the term \u2018wider \nfamilies\u2019 to refer to this concept, and opines that such families result from individuals\u2019 \nlifestyles and may not involve the sharing of a household. This concept of family \ndescribes a group of people who are invested in one another due to bonds of \n 7\ndependence, obligation or duty, love, caring, or cooperation (Rothausen, 1999). In the \nsame way, Weeks, Heapy and Donovan (2001) refer to same-sex families, which are \nfounded on bonds of individual choice, as \u2018families of choice\u2019. \nThere is also a great deal of cultural variability in how the term family is \ndefined. Studies of low-income Black families in the U.S. demonstrate \nconceptualizations of family that place greater emphasis on grandparents and great-\ngrandparents, on households headed by women rather than by men, on the ways in \nwhich friends and neighbours fulfill family roles, and on the potential for children to \nhave homes in a number of different households, including with their parents, \ngrandparents, and aunts and uncles (Patterson, 1996). \nThe evidence suggests that there is a need for a wider definition of family, as \nwork and family policies and initiatives at the organizational and national levels have \nvariable impacts on different groups of workers. There are a number of family \nconfigurations that are not addressed in the work-family literature, or indeed \nacknowledged by American employment legislation. The following section will \nreview some of these non-traditional family structures and discuss the ways in which \nthey differ from \u201ctraditional\u201d (i.e., nuclear) families with respect to the work-family \ninterface. The areas in which non-traditional families are disadvantaged by current \npolicy and legislation will also be discussed. We will conclude by suggesting changes \nto academic theory as well as to policy at both the organizational and governmental \nlevels.  \nSame-sex couples \nThe American Community Survey (2004) estimates that there are \napproximately 707,196 same-sex, cohabitating couples in the U.S. This figure makes \nup  1.16% of all American households. According to recent figures, approximately \n 8\nfour million children in the U.S. are being raised by lesbian or gay parents (Stacey & \nBiblarz, 2001). While same-sex households share much in common with their \nheterosexual counterparts, research provides evidence of some notable differences \nbetween the two in both the work and the family domains. Distribution of paid and \nunpaid work hours tends to be more egalitarian among same sex couples than among \nheterosexual couples. While female partners in heterosexual couples often work fewer \npaid hours than their male partners, in gay and lesbian couples, both partners are more \nlikely to work full time.  Division of household labour is also more egalitarian, with \nfewer instances of gender-based patterns of task allocation (Kurdek, 1993; Patterson, \n2000).   \nDifferences between lesbian and heterosexual women are also evident with \nregard to their managers\u2019 and co-workers\u2019 attitudes toward working mothers. A recent \nstudy of workplace attitudes toward lesbian women found that lesbians were preferred \nover heterosexual women as employees, due to perceptions of lesbians as less likely \nto get married and give up work to raise children. Lesbian women on average earn \nmore than heterosexual women, and employed lesbian mothers are perceived as being \nmore competent and committed to work than employed heterosexual mothers (Peplau \n& Fingerhut, 2004). \nIn terms of relationship dynamics and support to be found within the home \ndomain, lesbian couples have been found to report higher levels of positive problem \nsolving than their heterosexual counterparts (Kurdek, 2001). Partners in lesbian \ncouples also reported higher levels of relationship cohesion and equality, and lower \nlevels of relationship costs than did heterosexual couples. Support from friends and \nfamily also differ between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Kurdek\u2019s (2001) \nresearch found that both gay couples and lesbian couples received less support from \n 9\ntheir families of origin than did heterosexual couples. However, lesbian partners \nreported higher levels of support from both their own friends and their partners\u2019 \nfriends than did heterosexual couples. Rose and Bravewomon (1998) note that in \nterms of social network and extended familial networks, gay and lesbian families are \nsimilar to heterosexual extended family structures.  \nIn the U.K., owing to adoption of the European Union\u2019s progressive \nlegislation, same-sex couples that register their civil partnership have had the same \nrights as a married couple in areas such as tax, social security, inheritance, \nimmigration, and workplace benefits since 2005 (Women and Equality Unit, 2005). \nWhile a number of places in the U.S. have registered partnerships or registered \ncohabitation systems wherein many or all of the same benefits granted married people \nare given to same-sex couples (e.g., Vermont, California, Hawaii, Washington, D.C., \nNew Jersey), same-sex partnerships are not recognized in many other states. \nOrganizations in these states therefore have no requirement to provide their gay or \nlesbian employees with health, leave, or pension benefits that recognize their same-\nsex partners. This lack of recognition can result in severe financial penalties for same-\nsex couples, with no access to survivor pensions or to health insurance coverage, and \nno right to take family leave in order to care for a non-marital partner. For instance, \nthe Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s release of the \u201cThe State of the Workplace \n2005-2006\u201d report shows that nearly half (49%) of Fortune 500 companies still fail to \noffer domestic partner health insurance benefits. As Rothausen-Vange (2005) notes, \nmany companies continue to rely on legal definitions of family, such as that used by \nthe FMLA, to guide them in their provision of benefits and leave policies. \nSexual orientation presents a significant consideration for the definition of \nfamily at organizational and national levels. Failure to recognize civil partnerships as \n 10\na legitimate form of family puts gay, lesbian, and bisexual workers at a disadvantage \nin the workplace. However, the field of civil partnership, which is afforded to gay and \nlesbian couples as an alternative to marriage, and other sexual liberties are targets of \nmany political and theological battles (Brammer 2006) that are currently being settled \nin the international domain. The precarious nature of rights and the growingly vocal \nopposition deems the position of gay and lesbian families more vulnerable, and more \ndeserving of academic attention.   \nMulti-generational and extended families \nThe \u201csandwich generation\u201d\nIn a survey of a nationally representative sample of the U.S. labour force, 20% \nof respondents had simultaneous childcare and eldercare responsibilities (Bond, \nGalinsky, & Swanberg, 1998). These individuals are commonly referred to as the \n\u201csandwich generation,\u201d and are acknowledged as facing exceptional difficulties in \nbalancing the demands of work and home (Vanier Institute of the Family, 2000).  \nWhen contemporary demographic conditions are considered, eldercare provided by \nthe sandwich generation is likely to result in increasing sources of conflict between \nwork and family in the U.S., as in much of the Western world. As average life \nexpectancy increases and the birth rate declines (United Nations, 2005), the American \npopulation is aging (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002). The age distribution of the United \nStates is characterized by an overrepresentation of people in their prime working \nyears, and a diminishing pool of young adults. As the average age of the population \nincreases, more working adults will be called upon to take responsibility for care of \ntheir elderly parents or other relatives. Currently, the National Alliance for Caregiving \nand the American Association of Retired Persons (2004) estimate that 44 million \nAmerican adults provide unpaid care to another adult, and 59% of these either work \n 11\nor have worked while doing so. Sixty-two percent of this group has had to make some \nadjustments to their work life, such as coming in late to work, or giving up their jobs \nentirely.  \nIn a national survey of 2,352 sandwich generation Americans, the National \nAssociation of State Units on Aging (2001) found evidence of racial differences in \ncaregiving responsibilities. While 42% of Asian Americans reported providing heavy \neldercare or financial support, only 20% of White respondents provided care for their \nelderly parents. Approximately one third of both Hispanics and African Americans \nreported providing care for their parents, with Hispanics (similar to Asian Americans) \nengaging in heavier care duties.   \nResearch indicates that caring for elderly dependents whilst engaging in paid \nemployment can result in a number of negative consequences for individuals. Work \nby Gottlieb, Kelloway and Fraboni (1994) found that increased involvement in elder \ncare activities placed employees at risk of more family interference with work, more \nstress, and more personal and job costs. Eldercare has also been found to adversely \naffected employees\u2019 well-being and work performance if they are situated in \nunsupportive work and family climates (Kossek, Colquitt, & Noe 2001).  This may be \npartially due to the fact that employment does not appear to diminish the amount of \ntime caregivers spend in eldercare activities (Levande, Herrick, & Sung, 2000). For \ninstance, research by Doty, Jackson and Crown (1998) found that employed women \nwho were the primary caregivers for elderly parents provided an average of 18 hours \nof care per week, which was comparable to the amount of time spent in caregiving \nactivities by unemployed women.  \nWomen tend to report spending more time in caregiving activities for elderly \ndependents than do men, and they also appear to suffer greater negative consequences \n 12\nof caregiving because of their greater level of involvement (Kramer & Kipnis, 1995; \nLee, Walker, & Shoup, 2001; Martin, 2000). Lee et al. (2001) found that employed \nindividuals providing informal care for elderly relatives reported more symptoms of \ndepression than did retired caregivers or employed non-caregivers. As the number of \ncaregiving hours increased, significantly more symptoms of depression and poorer \noverall emotional health were reported.  \nAlthough providing care for elderly relatives is similar to providing care for \nyoung children in that it places additional resource demands upon the caregiver, \nindividuals engaged in eldercare activities may experience problems and burdens that \nthose caring for children do not. For instance, awareness of the elderly relative\u2019s \ndegeneration, and the nature of the relationship between the caregiver and the care \nreceiver, are issues unique to those providing informal care for the elderly (Lee et al., \n2001; Tully & Sehm, 1994). Researchers have found that hours spent on eldercare are \nmore stressful for employed women than those spent on childcare (MacDonald, \nPhipps, & Lethbridge, 2005). A lack of alternative care providers also presents a \nproblem to employed individuals who are responsible for elderly relatives. While \nneighbors or family friends might be prevailed upon to babysit young children should \nthe need suddenly arise, it can be much more difficult to arrange for substitute care for \nelderly relatives given work-related crisis requiring late hours or last-minute travel.  \nWhile the FMLA does permit employees to take leave from work in order to \ncare for their parents or spouses, other groups of individuals for whom employees \nmay provide ongoing care are not included in the eligibility criteria. For example, the \nNational Alliance for Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons\u2019 \n(2004) report identified grandparents, parents-in-law, and siblings as other major care \nrecipients. Fully 17% of all caregivers reported providing care for elderly persons \n 13\nwho were not relatives. Should a caregiving emergency arise that requires them to \ntake time off work, employees providing care to those other than their own parents are \nvulnerable to a host of consequences ranging from demotion to job loss.  \nExtended families \nExtended families living in the same household can be considered another \nform of multi-generational household and are examples of differences in the assumed \nnormal form of family across cultures. In many Asian countries, for example, a \n\u201cnormal\u201d family includes three or more generations living in one household, \nsometimes with aunts, uncles, and cousins in addition to parents and children. Within \nthe United States, many of these cultures have been understudied (Rothausen-Vange, \n2005). Approximately 20% of adults aged 65 to 70 in the United States live with their \nadult children (Levande, Herrick, & Sung, 2000), and as life expectancy continues to \nrise, the number of multigenerational families may increase. In some countries, there \nare expectations that unmarried children remain in their parental homes. In the case of \nTurkey, this is evident even in cosmopolitan areas, offering young adults temporary \nprotection from the harsher conditions of the commercial housing market (\u00d6zbilgin & \nWoodward, 2003).  \nAccording to Bengtson (2001), the role of extended families is becoming \nprogressively more important given increases in marital instability and the divorce \nrate in the United States over recent decades. As the bonds of nuclear families \ndissolve, he argues, these families\u2019 ability to socialize, nurture, and support their \nmembers is weakened, and extended family members will be required to provide \nthese functions. At the same time, conflict has been identified as a significant element \nin multigenerational families (Clarke, Preston, Raksin, & Bengtson, 1999). Bengtson, \n 14\nRosenthal and Burton (1995) refer to the \u201cparadox between conflict and solidarity\u201d as \ncharacteristic of most relationships between parents and children.  \nThere is also extensive literature on distinct formations of families that emerge \nafter separation and divorce. Beck and Beck-Gernsheim (2001, p. 96) highlight the \nemergence of serial family formations including \u2018patchwork families,\u2019 which are \nfamilies with children from previous relationships as well as from current ones. The \npatchwork family formation adds to the complexity of the extended family issue by \nbringing in another form of division in families, i.e. by blood line.  \nExtended or multigenerational families offer unique supports, and unique \nchallenges. For employed mothers living in the same household as their parents-in-\nlaw, as is common in families of Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi origin, the \npresence of the older generation may result in assistance with childcare \nresponsibilities. On the other hand, this arrangement also entails additional \nhousework, as cultural expectations hold the wife responsible for looking after the \nhusband and his parents (Dale, 2005). Living in extended families is often associated \nwith more traditional cultural values on the part of the older generation, which can \nadd an extra layer of family pressures to working women, especially mothers. For \nexample, Dale\u2019s (2005) research among employed women of Pakistani and \nBangladeshi women identified cultural expectations for these women to attend events \nsuch as weddings and funerals for extended family members or friends of the older \ngeneration, as well as to provide hospitality for any visiting friends or family \nmembers, however distant. Therefore, whilst extended families may lend support to \ntheir members, there is always a reciprocity which places demands and expectations \non the members. Put in the context of expectations of temporal and spatial flexibility \nfrom individual workers in industrialized societies, extended families do not only \n 15\nprovide support for accommodation of these demands but may also constrain their \nmembers\u2019 temporal and spatial commitment to work, through assertion of reciprocal \nexpectations.   \nEven when the family is described in standardized terms, the cultural \nsignificance of what family means in the context of work varies extensively. For \nexample, Aryee, Fields, and Luk (1999) identify differences in the work-family \ninterface among samples of U.S. and Hong Kong workers. For the American \nemployees, family interference with work exerted a significant, positive effect on \nlevels of depression. For the Hong Kong employees, it was work interference with \nfamily that exerted a negative effect on well-being. \nWomen in particular appear to be subject to greater difficulties in reconciling \nwork and family when living in extended families that are very traditional in their \noutlook (Aycan & Eskin, 2005). In these types of cultural context, women are still \nexpected to make family and domestic life their priority, regardless of their \ncommitments to paid employment. Employers, for their part, largely fail to recognize \nfamily structures other than the nuclear unit, and workplace policies often do not \naccount for relatives other than parents, spouses or children. As stated earlier, the \nFMLA makes no provisions for siblings, cousins, aunts, or uncles, or other relations \nwith whom an employee may share a household or simply have strong ties of \naffection or obligation.  \nGrandparents as parents, again \nGrandparents who are responsible for primary care of their grandchildren are \nthe final form of multi-generational families we consider. Over four million children \nin the United States under the age of 18 live in a grandparent\u2019s household (Minkler & \nRoe, 1993). At some point in their lives, nearly 11% of all grandparents provide at \n 16\nleast six months\u2019 care for their grandchildren (Fuller-Thomson, Minkler, & Driver, \n1997) and 39% of grandparents who are caring for their grandchildren have been \ndoing so for longer than five years (Simmons & Dye, 2003). The 2000 Census reports \nthat 2.4 million people have primary responsibility for grandchildren under 18 living \nwith them, with a higher proportion of these grandparents being African American \nand Native American than White, Hispanic, or Asian (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003). \nApproximately 71% of grandparents who are primary caregivers for their \ngrandchildren are between the ages of 30 and 59, which are key working years \n(Simmons & Dye, 2003). Studies of grandparents raising their grandchildren \nconducted in the 1990s have placed the rate of their employment between 25% and \n55% (Burton, 1992; Jendrek, 1994).  \nThere are a number of reasons why these \u201cskipped generation families\u201d of \ngrandchildren living with grandparents come into being. Diminishing social welfare \nafforded to families (Iceland & Kim, 2001) and increased proportions of single parent \nfamilies (Cooksey, Menaghan, & Jekielek, 1997) account in part for a growing need \nfor the care services of grandparents. Teen pregnancy, parental substance abuse, \nimprisonment, mental and\/or physical illness, death, or abuse and neglect of their \nchildren may result in grandparents assuming primary responsibility for their \ngrandchildren (Sands & Goldberg-Glen, 2000). Such traumatic circumstances may \nresult in these grandchildren experiencing unique emotional, psychological, and\/or \nphysical needs. These needs, in turn, may adversely affect their grandparents\u2019 ability \nto work.  \nA great deal of research supports the notion that grandparent caregivers suffer \nan emotional and psychological toll from their caring responsibilities. In a study of 40 \ngrandmothers who were primary caregivers for their grandchildren, challenges \n 17\nidentified by the participants included having limited energy due to their age, \nnegotiating changing family roles, and parenting in what they perceived to be a toxic \nsocial environment (Dolbin-MacNab, 2006). Providing primary care for a grandchild \nhas been associated with reduced levels of self-assessed health (Musil & Ahmad, \n2002), and higher levels of depressive symptoms (Minkler, Fuller-Thomson, Miller, \n& Driver, 1997). In a study of 50 African-American grandparents who were raising \ntheir grandchildren, 94% reported a clinically significant level of stress (Ross & Aday, \n2006). \nYounger grandparents, who are still experiencing demands from the \nworkplace as well as from their caregiving responsibilities, are apt to experience more \ndepression and psychological anxiety (Minkler et al., 1997; Sands & Goldberg-Glen, \n2000). A lack of available support is another key factor contributing to the stress of \ngrandparent caregivers. Low family cohesion, poor grandparent health, and \ngrandchildren with psychological and physical problems have been associated with \npsychological anxiety and depression, while the use of professional counseling and \nspecial school programs is related to lower levels of stress (Minkler et al., 1997; Ross \n& Aday, 2006; Sands & Goldberg-Glen, 2000). \nAs is clear, grandparents caring for their grandchildren face a host of issues \ndifferent from those experienced by parents looking after their own young children. \nThese are exacerbated by a lack of formal recognition of their role by definitions of \nfamily such as that exemplified by the FMLA. Grandparents who need to take time \noff work because of their caregiving responsibilities may have few options beyond \ntaking unpaid leaves of absence, or leaving their jobs altogether. Finding subsequent \nemployment may be difficult due to their age and to their childrearing duties. Daycare \nor after-school care for children often have eligibility requirements that are complex, \n 18\nand these care programs may either exclude grandparent caregivers from making use \nof them, or offer fewer benefits than those provided to parents (Sands & Goldberg-\nGlen, 2000). In addition, not all employed grandparent caregivers have legal custody \nof their grandchildren, which can be yet another complication in the search for \ncommunity or workplace support.  \nBeyond space and time: Virtual families \nThe way we traditionally frame family is bounded by rationales of time and \nspace. It is coded by space, as family is often considered a unit of cohabiting \nindividuals in its broader definitions. Academic research on the work-family interface \nin both Western and non-Western contexts continues to tacitly accept marriage as the \nmain measure and proxy for family membership (e.g. Ahmad, 1996; Aryee, Fields & \nLuk, 1999; Aryee, Srinivas, & Tan, 2005; Clark, 2000). This leads to a wide gap in \nour knowledge of non-traditional families and their interface with work. Considering \nthat the conception of family demarcated as a nuclear family based on matrimony is a \nWestern concept, studies on non-Western contexts that adopt these U.S. based models \nare more likely to diverge in their understanding of the realities of family and work in \nnon-Western contexts.   \nFamily is also characterized by a temporal commitment between partners \noutside work hours. However, cosmopolitan lifestyles of today also allow for different \nconceptions of family, including partners living mainly away from each other and \nwith limited time together. Increased migration enhances the likelihood of such long-\ndistance family formations and poses further complexities for care, family and work \ndecisions as migrant families fall outside our mainstream conceptions of family (Wall \n& Jose, 2004). It is important to acknowledge, nevertheless, that even a virtual family \n 19\nthat transcends traditional expectations of spatial and temporal commitment also \nplaces demands on workers\u2019 work and life arrangements.  \nWhat are the consequences of using narrow definitions of \u201cfamily\u201d? \nAs this review has shown, limited institutional definitions of family \ndisadvantage non-traditional families in a number of ways \u2013 primarily by denying \nthem the supports they need in order to successfully balance paid work with family \nlife. U.S. employment legislation betrays a bias toward the nuclear family unit, \nexcluding many different types of family configurations from the benefits enjoyed by \nwhat amounts to a shrinking proportion of American households. As a result, many \nworkplaces exhibit a limited awareness of alternative family models, and thus provide \nlimited instrumental and emotional supports. Family-related issues that are not \nconcerned with childcare, such as elder care, may suffer from a perceived lack of \nlegitimacy.  \nBruce and Reed (1994) note that many \u2018family friendly\u2019 policies fail to help \nworking parents and dual income couples, as the traditional approaches of workplace \nsupervision of command and control are underpinned by values that question the \nintegrity and commitment of workers who assume childcare responsibilities. \nTherefore, the organizing logic and culture of work should be scrutinized if the \nnegative effects of narrowly defining family are to be overcome.  \nAnother outcome of limited institutional definitions of family is limited \nresearch on work-family issues. Other researchers have highlighted shortcomings of \nthe work-family literature. Parasuraman and Greenhaus (2002) cite the overemphasis \nof work-family research on nuclear families and the exclusion of single parent \nhouseholds or blended families, noting that research investigating the role of family \nsocial support usually limits itself to support provided by a spouse or partner, and thus \n 20\nunderestimates the amount of support actually received by individuals in non-\ntraditional families. In her review of organizational research measures of \u201cfamily,\u201d \nRothausen (1999) identifies the almost exclusive adoption of the legal, nuclear \ndefinition of family as a major weakness. However, the vast majority of articles \npublished in the work-family literature still focus on couples in heterosexual \nrelationships, usually with dependent children. This constrains our knowledge about \nthe processes underlying the work-family interface for all but a subset of the \npopulation, and therefore restricts researchers\u2019 ability to identify problems faced by \nmembers of non-traditional family configurations. With such limited knowledge of \nthe realities faced by employed members of non-nuclear families, appropriate \nsolutions to existing problems cannot be effectively developed.  \nRecommendations for change and directions for research \nWe now provide several recommendations that may help address some of the \ninadequacies of narrow definitions of work and family. We first call for a more \ninclusive conceptualization of family and work, which embraces both emergent and \nmainstream forms. Family can be defined in a more inclusive way in research \nprojects. Questions on family and marital status can be modified to include a wider \nrange of possibilities. It would make sense to spell out civil partnerships, extended, \npatchwork, and virtual family formations in designing research instruments. Families \nare not likely to remain static over time. Therefore, research design could capture the \ntransformation of what research participants consider as family by allowing the option \nof an \u2018other\u2019 category, with the opportunity to write in relevant \u201cmembers\u201d that \ncaptures new forms of family.  \nWe argue that the organizational initiatives of work-life balance should also be \nmore accommodating of diverse choices, experiences, and relationships of the \n 21\nworkers. Furthermore, achieving a balance between work and family demands \nrequires cultural and structural changes through a spectrum of organizational \ndevelopment activities as well as public policy interventions and state regulation.  \nWhen \u201cfamily\u201d is narrowly defined from an institutional standpoint, \nindividuals who fall outside the confines of this definition are disadvantaged in the \nworkplace. To overcome this disadvantage, changes in academic theorization and in \npolicy at both the organizational and legislative levels are needed. \nBielby (1992) notes that the literature on commitment to work and family \noften conflates the distinction among family, marriage, and other constituent parts of \nfamily. In recent years, there have been attempts by some scholars to offer wider \nmeasures of family structure to include individuals who are married (Carlson & \nKacmar, 2000), parents (Clarke, 2002), living with partners (Baltes & Heydens-Gahir, \n2003), co-habiting (Batt & Valcour, 2003) with children (Berg, Kalleberg, & \nAppelbaum, 2003) and caregiving responsibilities (Blair-Loy & Wharton, 2002). \nWhilst some of these studies incorporated multiple family configurations, very few \nstudies incorporated a comprehensive set of family configurations including samples \nwith or without partners, children, or eldercare responsibilities (e.g. Edwards & \nRothbard, 1999).  What is lacking is a level of coherence or convergence across \nstudies of the work-life interface to adopt wider and more inclusive measures of \nfamily structure. Furthermore, definitions of family in academic studies are not broad \nenough to reflect emergent and non-traditional forms of family that are becoming \nmore prevalent in society. These distinctions should be recognized and reflected in \ndesign, implementation and analysis of research in the field.  \nOne of the difficulties of offering classical categories of single, married, co-\nhabiting, widowed, and divorced, is that individuals \u2013 particularly those in same-sex \n 22\nrelationships, civil partnerships, or with large and extended families - may fail to \nidentify themselves in these terms, as these nuances are often lost in the design of \nsurvey questions. For example, terms such as dual-income couples often do not \ninclude same-sex dual income partnerships (e.g. Butler et al., 2005; Crossfield, \nKinman & Jones, 2005) or dual-income but work-sharing couples (Gronseth, 1974). \nTherefore, there is a need for inclusion of these categories in more open terms in \nfuture research studies.  \nThere are a number of potential research questions that arise from our \nsuggested redefinition of family in the context of work. First, researchers may gain \ngreater insight into a wider range of issues surrounding the interface between work \nand family. How do we frame family and personal responsibilities with commitment \nto paid employment if we adopt more inclusive definitions of both work and family?  \nWhat are the implications of more inclusive definitions of family on accommodating \nwork and life demands of workers? What are the unique accommodations that are \nmade, both in the family sphere and at work, by groups that are traditionally excluded \nfrom definitions of family? Do these accommodations have repercussions for career \nprogress or family well-being? What forms of organisational and familial support are \navailable to these types of families, and are they sufficient?  \nSecondly, a more inclusive definition of family yields research questions \nrelated to organizational work-family policy. Are employees likely to express less \nsatisfaction with the restrictive work-family policies currently offered in most \norganizations if the concept of family is expanded in scope? Research tells us that \nwomen and employees with children are most likely to view work-family policies as \nfair (Parker & Allen, 2001). If the definition of family is expanded but access to \nwork-family policies is not, would the perceived fairness of these policies be \n 23\ndiminished? Might take-up of work-family policies increase, as the \u201cmommy track\u201d \nstigma of policy use is reduced, or would career-oriented individuals continue to steer \nclear of any admission that their commitment to the organization exists alongside \nfamily responsibilities?  \nIf same-sex couples and virtual families are explicitly included in the \ndefinition of family, to what extent would the gendered nature of work-family issues \ncontinue to dominate public and organizational perception? Would this expanded \ndefinition help to increase the focus of work-family conflict beyond working mothers \nto include all members of all family structures and types, and would this in turn \ncontribute to a change in traditional organizational cultures that require family life to \naccommodate work, rather than the other way around? Could such an inclusive \ndefinition of family challenge and subvert the gender binaries that currently dominate \nour routines of work and organisation, and free the concept of \u2018family-friendly\u2019 from \nthe grasp of paternalistic, authoritarian and conservative ideologies of work?  If the \nconcept of family is expanded, are organizations willing to concurrently expand \nbenefit offerings and other practices associated with \u201cfamily\u201d?   \nIn terms of organizational work-family policy, Scully and Creed (1999) \ndescribe a firm whose solution to the issue of spousal versus domestic partner benefits \nwas to offer all employees a fixed amount of benefits, which could be deployed to \nwhomever the employee wished. This enabled employees to direct resources to the \nfamily members who most needed their assistance, whether that meant a spouse, an \nelderly aunt, or a non-relative who nonetheless held an important place in their lives. \nThis type of approach ensures equal treatment for all employees, regardless of their \nhousehold configuration or family responsibilities, and is a template for organizations \n 24\nwishing to create an environment in which all workers can contribute to the best of \ntheir abilities.  \nThis approach, however, naively assumes that all workers face similar \nchallenges and demands at work and life and that standardized measures could \npromote a feeling of equity. In an Australian study, Bardoel, Moss, Smyrnios, and \nTharenou (1999) demonstrated that workers from certain groups, such as women, \nunion workers, long serving employees, and those with dependents, display a greater \nneed for work-family policies than others. Therefore, a further suggestion can be \nmade that organizations should also recognize differences between individual \ncircumstances and act with compassion and benevolence towards the demands of their \nworkers for better accommodation of their work and family responsibilities.  \nIf compassion and benevolence are not viewed as relevant to the bottom line, \neffects on absence, tardiness, and turnover relevant to work and family conflicts are \nclearly relevant. Current research highlights the existence of benefits for organizations \nthat seek to assist their employees to balance both work and family demands. \nSurveying the causal relationship between work-family initiatives and the bottom line \nin the U.S. context, Arthur (2003) demonstrated that companies implementing \npolicies to accommodate the work-family interface reap benefits to their financial \nbottom line and to their shareholder returns (Arthur & Cook, 2004).   \nSimilarly, the social context and culture of the workplace play a significant \nrole in take-up of work-family initiatives. Therefore, as Blair-Loy and Wharton \n(2002) propose, the social context needs to be considered in terms of its varied impact \non individuals from different demographic backgrounds. Furthermore, \nconceptualizations of family and work are embedded in cultures and geographies, \nreflecting the particular requirements of social and economic life in these settings. \n 25\nAttention should be paid to understanding the contextual variations of meaning, \nframes and practices of family and work in order to ensure realistic theoretical and \npolicy formulations for family and work, in ways that are sensitive to cultural and \ncontextual differences.  \nTwo main challenges that face employers in improving work-life balance are \n(a) the entrenched nature of long working hours in cultures where full-time working \nhours are the dominant norm, and (b) the difficulties in recognizing the pressures and \ndemands that paid work and unpaid domestic and care work place on individual \nemployees (Drago & Hyatt, 2003). This latter issue is particularly problematic given \nthe constrained model of \u201cfamily\u201d adopted by U.S. legislation and thus the majority of \nAmerican workplaces. Wide adoption of this model is likely to result in non-work \nrelated pressures and demands on employees being underestimated. However, both \nissues present a complex challenge. Anttila, Natti, and Vaisanen\u2019s (2005) report on \nexperiments on reduced working hours conducted by Finnish municipalities identifies \nboth positive and negative outcomes of the trials. While shorter working hours may \nappear to be an attractive organizational strategy for achieving greater work-life \nbalance among employees, Anttila et al.\u2019s research showed that men remained \nreluctant to make use of this accommodation, perpetuating the stereotyped perception \nthat family is the domain for women and that work-life balance is a women\u2019s issue. \nTherefore, quick fix legal solutions based on narrow conceptualizations of work and \nfamily may not generate desired positive impacts if they are not supplemented with \ncultural changes at the level of the organization and the society. \nAlbrecht (2003) argues that family-friendly policies at the organizational level \nare insufficient to respond to the challenge of sustaining the well-being of family \nmembers in free market economies, as such policies are vulnerable to changes in \n 26\neconomic circumstances, becoming more evident in times of economic growth. \nSimilarly, a review by Glass and Estes (1997) illustrates that organizational policies \nfor a family-responsive workplace are problematic at multiple levels. Albrecht (2003) \nsuggests that in the absence of effective organizational policies, there is an ethical \ncase for governments to take effective action to address the problems faced by \nworking families.  \nOutside of the U.S., examples of more inclusive definitions of \u201cfamily\u201d can be \nfound at the level of national government. Despite evidence of wide variation across \nEuropean countries in terms of national contexts and uptake of work-life policies \n(Hantrais & Ackers, 2005), Cook (1989) explains that the U.S. does not fare well \nwhen compared to European countries in terms of its public policy efforts to provide \nsupports for non-traditional and atypical families. For instance, in addition to its legal \nrecognition of same-sex couples through its 2004 Civil Partnership Act, the United \nKingdom\u2019s employment legislation presents a progressive approach in Europe, and \naccounts for a much broader interpretation of family than does the FMLA. The right \nto take time off work to care for dependents allows employees to care not only for \nimmediate family members such as children or parents, but also any other members of \nthe household who are not tenants or employees. The law further specifies that in \ncases of illness, injury, or the breakdown of regular care arrangements, dependents \ncan also be defined as individuals who reasonably rely on the employee for assistance \n(Department of Trade and Industry, 2007a). As an example, employees may take time \noff work to care for a nearby relative who becomes ill unexpectedly, or for a \nneighbour living alone who suffers a fall and becomes injured. \nMore recently, the U.K.\u2019s Work and Families Act 2006 was passed to update \nthe 2003 Flexible Working Law. These legislative acts give employee caregivers the \n 27\nright to request to work flexibly, and place a duty upon employers to consider these \nrequests seriously. Eligible employees may have caregiving responsibilities for \nchildren under six years of age, disabled children under 18 years of age, or adults who \nare either relatives, or who are living in the same household as the employee. In \naddition to parents and foster parents, guardians and \u201cspecial guardians\u201d of children \nare eligible to make requests to vary the amount, timing, or location of their hours of \nwork (Department of Trade and Industry, 2007b). By extending the definition of care \nrecipient beyond the usual criterion of offspring or parent, U.K. legislation attempts to \nenable employees in a variety of familial configurations to successfully balance their \nwork and family demands. With its continued focus on the increasingly outmoded \nnuclear family unit, U.S. legislation needs to follow suit in order to better meet the \nneeds of a populace whose domestic arrangements and own interpretation of family \nare too often incompatible with the rigid definition used by government and many \nworkplaces. There is certainly a need for further research to uncover the interplay \nbetween framing of family and work and its consequences in the design of jobs, \norganizational interventions, social policy and state regulation.  \n 28\nReferences \nAhmad, A.
