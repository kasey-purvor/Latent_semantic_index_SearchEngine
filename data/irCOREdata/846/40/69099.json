This paper argues that human efforts to enact\nsuch a proportionment are, ironically, justified by the same reasons that make the\nidea of divine justice seem so problematic. Moralists have often regarded our\nfrailty and fallibility as reasons for abstaining from the judgment of others; and\ndoubts about our deserving some proportionment of happiness or unhappiness\noften arise insofar as virtue and vice may be explained on a causal basis. This\npaper argues that our fallibility and our susceptibility to social influence render judg-\nment and response indispensable, because \u2013 given these characteristics \u2013 our actions\nand responses decide the morality that we actually share with one another. In this\nsituation, to \u2018judge not\u2019 is to abandon the field to those with no such scruples.\n. . .an impartial rational spectator can take no delight in seeing the\nuninterrupted prosperity of a being graced with no feature of a\npure and good will, so that a good will seems to constitute the\nindispensable condition even of worthiness to be happy.\n\u2013 Kant1\nThere is also the figure, rarer perhaps than Callicles supposed,\nbut real, who is horrible enough and not miserable at all but,\nby any ethological standard of the bright eye and the gleaming\ncoat, dangerously flourishing.\n\u2013 Bernard Williams2\nThere is a very old thought: that the wicked deserve to suffer, and the\nvirtuous to be happy. There is an equally ancient difficulty: in the\nworld we know those deserts are only partly meted out, if at all.\nNearly as old is the injunction, \u2018Judge not, that ye not be judged\u2019\n(Matthew, 7:1). One way out of the resulting perplexities is the\nmyth of a soul that persists after death into a future world, where\n1 Groundwork, 4:393, in Practical Philosophy (trans. Mary Gregor,\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 49.\n2 Bernard Williams, Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (London:\nFontana, 1985), 46.\n47\ndoi:10.1017\/S003181910999043X & The Royal Institute of Philosophy, 2010\nPhilosophy 85 2010\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nmatters are better ordered \u2013 where the virtuous will be rewarded,\nwhere the wicked will be punished, perhaps also reformed. Such\nbeliefs are at least as old as ancient Egypt and its famous \u2018Book of\ntheDead\u2019,3 and they have played a complex role in Christian theology\ndown the centuries. They are articulated in some of Plato\u2019s myths of\nthe afterlife,4 and given most systematic form in Kant\u2019s moral and\nreligious thought. For Kant, it is axiomatic that virtue \u2013 the\nquality of the will \u2013 should be understood as our \u2018worthiness to be\nhappy\u2019. His account of religious faith is based on reason\u2019s \u2018need\u20195 to\nbelieve that virtue and happiness will be proportioned to one\nanother in some future world, since they are not in this world.\nIn this paper I ask what relevance the idea of a just world should\nhave for us. The doctrine of an afterlife governed by a personal\nGod is no longer plausible to most of us, religious believers or no.\nI will contend, however, that some reasons why doctrines of a \u2018just\u2019\nafterlife have lost their plausibility are revealing for how we should\npicture justice in this world. I therefore begin with some of the prin-\ncipal moral difficulties of the idea of divine justice. These centre upon\na transactional model of punishment and reward that neglects our\ncontinuing relationship to He who judges. In the second section of\nthe paper I then turn to the natural question that arises when we\nthink about this world: might practices of human accountability\nreasonably be thought of as pursuing a just proportion between\nvirtue and happiness, wickedness and suffering? However, our limit-\nations as judges and (so to speak) executioners are severe, and may\nseem to undercut any such project. The third part of the paper under-\nlines a crucial relation between \u2018happiness\u2019 and virtue that concerns our\nstatus as relatingbeings: ourflourishingdepends onothers\u2019 cooperation\nin our projects. In the last part of the paper, I suggest that we also have\ngood reason to foster the opposite relation \u2013 between wickedness and\nsuffering, in one particular sense at least. In pursuing both points,\nI seek to allay doubts about the fairness of such a project, doubts reflect-\ning our widespread modern sense that none of us made ourselves who\nwe are. \u2018There but for the grace of God. . .\u2019 we say \u2013 rarely withGod in\nmind, but often withmisgivings about themaking ofmoral judgments\nand the doling out of \u2018just deserts\u2019.\n3 TheAncientEgyptianBookof theDead (trans.RaymondOliverFaulkner,\ned. Carol Andrews, Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), 27ff, 56f.\n4 Plato gives various accounts of the afterlife along these lines, includ-\ning: Phaedo, 107\u201314; Republic, 614\u201317; Gorgias, 523\u20137.\n5 Critique of Practical Reason, 5:125, 142, in Practical Philosophy, in\nop. cit. note 1, 241, 254.\n48\nGarrath Williams\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nMy overall argument is that those misgivings are misplaced, and\nthat it is our duty to judge and to share those judgments with\nothers. This argument centres on the following irony: we have such\na duty precisely because we lack the attributes that made it intelligible\nforGod, traditionally understood, to realise a state of perfect justice \u2013\nbut whichmadeHis relationship to it so morally problematic. In con-\ntrast to an infallible and independent God, our judgment is fallible\nand dependent on the correction and the example of others; while\nGod is beyond compare, human beings prove unequal in their judg-\nment and the example they set; while God is omnipotent, we gener-\nally have very limited powers over our fellow human beings, unless\nwe act together with others. Our fallibility might tempt us to think\nthat a proportionment of virtue and happiness is a task we had\nbetter forsake; similarly, if action and character are causally con-\nditioned. I argue, instead, that it is because of the difficulties we\nhave in judging one another and ourselves, and because we condition\none another\u2019s ways of being in the world, that mutual judgment and\nresponse are so essential. We depend on others\u2019 moral judgments to\narrive at a reasonable moral sense; some people\u2019s failure to attain\nthis requires us to judge and to act with others, to resist their\nactions and their example. Rather than being the ultimate deliverance\nof a divine judge, the idea of a proportionment of happiness and\nvirtue represents a simplification of the on-going task finite human\nbeings face in realising morality among themselves.\nI. Difficulties in the idea of a future just world\nSeveral moral perplexities attend the idea of divine justice. In each\ncase, I suggest, these turn on our status as relating beings, and\nhence are revealing for how we should think about mutual judgment.\nIt is a familiar charge that the thought of future justice negates\nmorality, by reducing the motivation for virtuous conduct to the\nhope of reward, and likewise the avoidance of vice to fear of divine\npunishment.6 There is something simple-minded in this objection,\nin that it seems to ignore the complexity of human motivation and\nthe role of habits and emotional sensitivity in our relations to one\n6 Some other criticisms proceed along parallel lines, in supposing that\nthe idea plays to moral and psychological weakness. Thus the future just\norder as a compensatory fantasy, perhaps for those who are not strong\nenough to exact justice in this world, or for those not strong enough to\nface up to the reality of an unjust world.\n49\n\u2018Who are we to judge?\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nanother.7 Anybody who single-mindedly oriented his conduct by the\nthought of rewards in a future world, rather than concern for those\nwith whom he shares this world, will be far from a paragon of outer\nvirtue, never mind the \u2018inner morality\u2019 or purity of heart that has\nso often concerned the moralists. Kant, for example, was extremely\nsensitive to the idea that moral conduct would cease to be moral if\nit weremotivated by the thought of reward, and insists that themotiv-\nation of duty itself must come first. His arguments that morality\ndemands faith in a future world concern the meaning of our moral\nstriving. Reason needs to make sense of theworld, to see that morality\nreally does have an apportioned place in the order of things, as would\nbe demonstrated if justice were ultimately done8 (or, perhaps, if it\nwere done in this world).\nA more sophisticated objection concerns the nature of our relation-\nship to God. There are obvious difficulties in conceptualising a\nrelationship where the superior party does not interact with us in\nany of the ways that other agents do; hence the metaphors we use\nbecome particularly important. If we picture God as an agent of\npunitive justice, our metaphor being that of law-maker and ruler,\nwe have a being who requites our sins with suffering. Indeed, some\ntheologians have entertained very literal images of hell as eternal pun-\nishment. Nietzsche gleefully noted Tertullian andAquinas\u2019s descrip-\ntions of the pleasures of heaven as including the sight, far below, of\nthe wicked being tormented for their sins. (In deliberate echo, he\ngoes on to mention the old punishment of debtors, whose creditors\nwere given the pleasure of cutting away the requisite \u2018pound of\nflesh\u2019.9) This transactional or \u2018forensic\u2019 model now seems rebarbative:\namong other things, it does not express our relationship toGod.Many\ntheologians have, therefore, pictured hell as an absence ofGod, a situ-\nation wherewe turn have our backs onGod, neglected or undermined\nour relationship to Him.10\nI think this objection and its response is central to our whole topic.\nA scheme of punishment and reward looks arbitrary and uncaring if it\n7 This self-defeatingness charge is also discussed, and this criticism\noffered, by George Sher, Desert (Princeton NJ: Princeton University\nPress, 1987), 138ff.\n8 See his comment on the morally righteous atheist, such as Spinoza, at\nCritique of Judgment, \u00a787, 5:452.\n9 Genealogy of Morality, I.15, II.5.\n10 I am ignoring, for the moment, all those accounts that suggest our\neternal fate will be a matter of election or predestination, since \u2013 as has so\noften been objected \u2013 such a future world cannot be described as just in\nany humanly comprehensible sense.\n50\nGarrath Williams\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nis not constitutively linked to our relationship to God. As I shall\nargue below, any this-worldly scheme must likewise be based in\nour relations to others: l\u2019enfer, ce n\u2019est pas les autres, rather it is their\nabsence or their palpable disappointment and withdrawal from us.\n(No doubt, some punishments make this very palpable indeed; but\nnone, we hold, should go so far as to cut away flesh.)\nThis relationality is also important when we turn to another essen-\ntially moral objection. The forensic image of heaven and hell implies\na radical individualism: we deserve alone and we will be punished\nalone. One old Catholic idea was that our prayers can intercede to\nassist those in purgatory.11 The idea of intercession surely departs\nfrom individual desert. But it is attractive inasmuch as it does not\nleave us abandoned by our fellow human beings, eternally isolated\nin our own efforts. Again, this point has a clear secular parallel:\nOur morality, the extent to which we succeed in becoming even\nhalf-way decent human beings, is no individual matter, but\ndepends greatly on the care others take of us. Many have thought\notherwise, of course; Kant, again, insisted a person\u2019s moral worth\nis precisely that which he himself has contributed by his own\nefforts. But this leaves the well-known difficulty of how to picture\nany absolute sense in which we alone have contributed anything at\nall, given that we are not \u2018first causes\u2019.12 Although we may argue\nabout the ways in which this is true, modern understandings of the\nhuman being insist that the quality of the relationships a person\nexperiences is central to who she becomes, morally as well as psycho-\nlogically speaking. Troubling as this understanding is for the idea of\ndivine judgment, however, I will be arguing that it does not \u2013 as\nmany have taken it to do \u2013 support a human duty to \u2018judge not\u2019.\nA final set of difficulties attends the moral sorting process involved.\nSome accounts of divine justice divide human beings into the damned\nand the saved, while others \u2013 for very obvious moral reasons \u2013 allow\nfor gradations of punishment corresponding to degrees of moral\nworth. Within a transcendent framework, \u2018the soul\u2019 may be ranked\nin terms of its sinfulness or purity. For much the same reasons that a\ntranscendent framework has become implausible to us, so too has\nthis conception of the soul. How, then, are we to give a reasonable\nsense to the idea of a single moral scale on which people can be\nranked? In everyday life, after all, our judgment of persons tends to\n11 I thank John O\u2019Neill for pointing this out to me.\n12 Thus the famous \u2018third antinomy\u2019 in Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason:\nthe contradiction between universal causation and the very idea of a first\ncause, whether as a matter of human or divine agency.\n51\n\u2018Who are we to judge?\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nbe, so to speak, qualitative rather than quantitative \u2013 that is, it relates to\nparticular character traits and actions, and often depends on our\nrelationship to the person. No doubt we may make some overall\njudgments (at any rate, my argument will presuppose this). But to\nrank people on a single scale, it seems we would need to identify a\nunitary capacity which all human beings have in common and\ncompare the extent to which they have exercised it \u2013 just as Kant\npictures each human being as equal in his capacity towill in accordance\nwith the moral law, but as more or less willing to do so.\nThis issue will turn out to be of some importance for my overall\nconclusion, and perhaps I may anticipate briefly. Just as the moralists\nhave often tried to unify virtue, so have they unified its proper fate,\nunder the head of happiness. But this must turn out to be either a\nvery complex idea, perhaps along the lines of Aristotle\u2019s eudaimonia,\nor a purely imaginary one, as in fact it is for Kant: \u2018it is just in this idea\n[of happiness] that all inclinations unite in one sum.\u201913 But if virtue is\nnot merely quantitative \u2013 that is, if we can hardly place each person\nsomewhere on a sliding scale from \u2018virtuous\u2019 to \u2018vicious\u2019 \u2013 then its\ndeserts are unlikely to be either. I will suggest that their description\nunder the head of \u2018happiness\u2019 obscures the more complex logic that\nunderlies the moralists\u2019 dream of a proportionment of happiness to\nvirtue, and the more complex duty we have to pursue this.\nTo summarise the key difficulties inhering in the idea of a future\nworld of divine justice, we could say that it ignores our status as relat-\ning beings. A simple picture of \u2018pay-back time\u2019 cannot genuinely\nmotivate us to do our duty by others. It makes a moral nonsense\nout of our relationship to God, and has nothing to say to our moral\ndependence upon others. Just as certain, we do not conduct ourselves\nto others in terms of some scale of overall \u2018deservingness\u2019, but make\ncomplex judgments about actions, virtues, and the claims of different\nrelationships.\nII. Virtue and happiness: problems of human judgment\nThe question I am pursuing is what is left in our hands once we leave\naside stories of another world and a divine judge. Should we suppose\nthat the moralists were merely dreaming and the claim of proportion-\nment is ill-founded? Or might it be \u2013 to take the most obvious possi-\nbility \u2013 that human, that is mutual, accountability should aim at a\nproportionment of happiness and virtue in this world? If so, as\n13 Groundwork, 4:399; cf. Critique of Practical Reason, 5:124.\n52\nGarrath Williams\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nbefore, therewill be bothmetaphysical andmoral perplexities attend-\ning this question. There are, what\u2019s more, directly practical difficul-\nties, as we are asked to make judgments of individual desert and to act\non them. Evidently, we lack the traditional characteristics of the\nChristian God: omnipotent, omniscient and perfectly benevolent.14\nDespite the difficulties discussed above, it was these characteristics\nthat made divine punishment and reward conceivable and, to a\npoint, morally tolerable: Presumably a limited God could not\nrealise all due rewards and punishments, while One who was not all-\nseeing and all-good could hardly be trusted with the task.\nOne might argue that these limitations \u2013 lack of power, lack of\nknowledge, problems of moral insight or motivation \u2013 are not so\nserious as to undermine any human duty to promote the proportion-\nment of happiness to virtue. On the contrary, I believe we should take\nthese difficulties very seriously, especially problems of moral insight.\nIf we do so, we will be led to think about accountability quite differ-\nently than on the other-worldlymodel \u2013 without thereby abandoning\nthe idea of a proportionment of happiness and virtue. In another\ncontext, Onora O\u2019Neill commented, \u2018It is fantasy to imagine that\nhuman reason can be vindicated as a partial version of an infinite\nreason.\u201915 Presumably, it would be equally fantastical to think of\nhuman, mutual, accountability on the model of divine judgment.16\nIt is self-evident that we do not make a final judgment: we invariably\njudge lives only partly lived, and therefore intervene in them from a\nparticular position; likewise, we are fallible and have only limited\npowers to enforce our judgments. Both judge and executioner will\nbe human, all too human. What they inhabit, however, is something\nthat God was never party to: a world of moral uncertainty built out of\nrelationships among equals \u2013 or rather, as I shall stress, near-equals.\nA quick word on each of the limitations of human judges. With\nregard to omnipotence: the powerlessness of the virtuous against\nthe vicious forms an old refrain. The lack of scruple pertaining to\nvice seems oftentimes a key to the effective wielding of power.\nMore, the power of our reproaches is often inversely proportional\n14 Such aGod is also incomparable and a \u2018first cause\u2019: in the last two sec-\ntions I will also consider the fact that human beings are not.\n15 \u2018Enlightenment as Autonomy: Kant\u2019s Vindication of Reason\u2019 in The\nEnlightenment and its Shadows (eds. P. Hulme and L. Jordanova, London,\nRoutledge, 1990), 190.\n16 Although Bernard Williams charges that modern conceptions of\nmorality do exactly this \u2013 cf. \u2018Moral Luck: A Postscript\u2019 in his Making\nSense of Humanity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 243.\n53\n\u2018Who are we to judge?\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nto a person\u2019s viciousness, for important moral qualities are involved\nin being sensitive to others\u2019 judgments. These complaints have\nsome force, but it is important to note that they gain in power, the\nmore unworldly \u2013 and the less judgmental \u2013 one\u2019s conception of\nvirtue: virtue as a matter of humble self-abnegation, perhaps; good-\nness as lost once we begin to resist evil. Consider, then, that our\npower to correct or punish an unrepentant wrongdoer depends very\nmuch on others\u2019 cooperation. Alone, my judgment is relatively\npowerless. Only by sharing judgments with others can we bring\nsuch a wrong-doer to book or to heel.\nAs to omniscience and benevolence: Our limited knowledge of\nthose whom we judge is often taken to be an argument that we\nshould abstain from judgment. Even if we observe all there is to\nsee, we do not see into one another\u2019s hearts \u2013 nor, of course, into\nour own. We can hardly be sure of our benevolence, and there are\nmany motivations that might lead us to judge others unfairly and\nhurtfully. And one may surely think that there are moral costs, at\nleast risks, in keeping a watchful or suspicious eye to others\u2019 actions\nand persons. These two limitations often feature in criticisms of\ngossip \u2013 a malicious, prejudicial affair, inimical to the interests of\nits subjects and to the virtue of its practitioners. We don\u2019t know\nenough about the persons concerned, we don\u2019t stop to ask them, we\njudge them with our own interests or corner of the world too much\nin mind, we should hate to have similar comments made against our-\nselves. The continued currency of the biblical injunctions is surely\nstriking: \u2018Judge not, that ye not be judged\u2019; \u2018He that is without sin\namong you, let him first cast a stone at her.\u201917\nThese difficulties point to another, still deeper difficulty about\nmutual judgment \u2013 one that will also be central to my argument.\nIn part concerned to save accountability and desert, many philoso-\nphers \u2013 Kant being a case in point \u2013 have insisted that we all have,\nor could have, access to the basic tenets of morality. The assumption\nis that punishment and other ill-deserts are just only in case the\nwrong-doer knew, or could have known, that he was transgressing.\nOur most familiar explanations of wrong-doing turn, then, to the\ntempting force of self-interest. Our inclinations lead us away from\nour duty; self-interest leads us to favour ourselves at the cost of\nothers. In Kant\u2019s words, we secretly make an exception for\n17 Matthew, 7:1; John, 8:7. I should add that I am only concerned with\nthe currency of the phrases, rather than their point in context, which is well-\ncaptured at Luke, 6:37: \u2018Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not,\nand ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.\u2019\n54\nGarrath Williams\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nourselves,18 while wishing that others act in accordance with the\nmoral norms we knowingly \u2013 and hence (?) culpably \u2013 breach. If\nthis were so, it is easy to see how mutual accountability could func-\ntion, notwithstanding our predilection to wrong-doing. Distorted\nand partial as our judgment may be, we know what to do and we\nknow what others should do; we may often want to do the wrong\nthing, but we want others to do the right thing and have powerful\nincentives to make them do it. In other words, mutual accountability\nensures that each person\u2019s natural partiality is checked by others\u2019.\nThere is clearly some truth in this line of thought; but human judg-\nment faces further difficulties that make matters more complicated\nthan this. Without denying that there are vices of selfishness or weak-\nness of will, any plausible theory of wrong-doing has to take account of\nthe fact that many wrong-doers believe that they are acting defensibly.\nWe may even say that it is the mark of a certain sort of virtue to believe\nthat one has transgressed a moral norm.19 (Just as it is the mark of a\ncertain sort of virtue to believe one ought to abstain from judgment.)\nSuch faulty self-assessment is not only a matter of bias \u2013 unjustly\nblaming others for disliked outcomes \u2013 though of course this can be\na serious source of misjudgment and unjust recrimination. Nor is it\nsimply a matter of false excuses and rationalisations, although it is\npartly that. Nor does it only concern a lack of responsiveness to\nothers as they express their legitimate demands of us. Although these\nare all serious issues, they still do not touch one of the central problems\nof mutual accountability: that many vices affect our sense of what we\nought to be doing, ought to have done, how our lives together\nshould go. As Aristotle put it, \u2018every wicked person is ignorant of\nwhat he should do and refrain from doing\u2019.20\nIn line with my emphasis upon our status as relating beings, recall\nthe truism that one of the surest ways to judge a person is by her\nfriends. What do we see in others, what do we want of others, what\ndo we expect of them \u2013 and vice versa, that we continue to keep\none another\u2019s company? The answers to these questions reveal our\nstandards, how far we live by those standards in practice, how\nwilling and able we are to judge by them. Furthermore, depending\n18 Groundwork, 4:424.\n19 As Hannah Arendt observed: \u2018a \u201cgood conscience\u201d is enjoyed as a\nrule only by really bad people, criminals and such, while only \u201cgood\npeople\u201d are capable of having a bad conscience,\u2019 The Life of the Mind\n(London: Secker & Warburg, 1978), Vol. I, 5.\n20 Nicomachean Ethics, 1110b (trans. Roger Crisp, Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2000).\n55\n\u2018Who are we to judge?\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\non the company we keep \u2013 and often, especially as children, have no\nchoice but to keep \u2013 there will be grave differences as regards the\nquality and standards of mutual accountability. He who responds\nto the reproaches of the vicious learns his morals at their table, so\nto speak: he will reproduce some of their vices or fall into yet\nothers (for instance, servility, if one heeds the reproaches of the\nbully). It is not the case, as Kant optimistically supposed, that vice\ndepends on secrecy, for it is often assisted by company that fails to\nsee it for what it is \u2013 thus the truckler who sees the bully as strong-\nminded, the bully who sees servility as his due.\nMany vices unfit us to call others to account, then, because they\ninvolve all sorts of moral blindness and insensitivity. In general, the\nmore an individual stands in need of correction, the less likely she is\nto heed it and the less fit she is to offer it to others. In terms of my\ntopic here, the proportionment of happiness to virtue: the problem is\nnot only our ability to dole out supposed deserts, but also that of judg-\nment \u2013 the ability to see actions and qualities of character, and to\nappreciate their true moral significance. (Recall Plato\u2019s frequent\nmention of virtue that is misrecognised as vice and immorality that\nis lauded by the world.) Accountability in this world is exacted by,\nand of, imperfect judges \u2013 regrettably partial in their view of others,\noften faulty in their grasp of valid moral standards. Given these limit-\nations, we may well feel grateful that people are so far from omnipo-\ntence, and often lack the power to enforce their judgments.\nIII. Happiness and flourishing\nMy argument is that these difficulties of mutual judgment, rather\nthan undermining all practical relevance for a dreamed-of propor-\ntionment of happiness to virtue, actually enable us to understand a\nmore complex, worldly foundation for the moralists\u2019 ideal.\nTo make this case, I begin with an obvious conceptual doubt about\nthis proportionment, one that does not turn on difficulties of practical\njudgment. Hastings Rashdall posed it with especial clarity: \u2018why\n[should] superior moral goodness. . . be assigned a superior quantity\nof external goods, that is to say, the means of indulging desires\nwhich have no connection with this superior moral goodness [?]. . . as\nthough goodness were a loss to the possessor which can only be ration-\nalised if he be paid for it.\u201921 One obvious way of responding is to ask if\n21 The Theory of Good and Evil (Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n1907), Vol. I, 257; quoted by George Sher, Desert, op. cit. note 7, 137.\n56\nGarrath Williams\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nthere might not be internal connections between our satisfactions and\nour virtues. Rashdall goes on to claim, in avowedly Aristotelian vein,\n\u2018The fitting reward of the good man (if we still talk of reward at all)\nis the opportunity for the freest and most fruitful exercise of his\nhighest capacities.\u2019 While the language is no longer ours, this clearly\npoints us to the concept missing from his initial question, that of\nflourishing, as a form of successful activity and, as I will emphasise,\ninteraction. Let me begin with two straightforward points that reveal\nsuch a connection, before raising a more complex question concerning\nothers\u2019 cooperation in our projects \u2013 one that relates back to the\ndifficulties of mutual judgment discussed in the previous section.\nOne obvious point is that many of the virtues \u2013 however exactly we\ndefine and judge them \u2013 are connected with our ability to respond\naptly and well to others, and hence with how fulfilling and rewarding\nare our relations to others. No doubt virtue may sometimes involve\nself-sacrifice \u2013 so a lack of proportionment to happiness (in the\ncrude sense, at any rate). Nonetheless, insofar as many virtues are\nthe sine qua non of quality in human relationships, and insofar as a\nperson may be judged by her friends, we can see an important\ninternal connection between virtue and happiness.\nA similar point might be made with regard to virtues of self-\ngovernance. Not just virtues of prudence, but those of moderation,\nself-control and self-responsibility are conducive to a fulfilled life \u2013\nassuming, that is, that one cannot rely on the boundless cooperation\nof circumstances (as the tyrant nannied and indulged from his cradle\nperhaps can). Part of the force of Plato\u2019s account of the well-ordered\nsoul is to suggest that these are not simply self-regarding virtues, that\nhowwe govern ourselvesmust have consequences for howwe relate to\nothers. Are the demands wemake of theworld reasonable, compatible\nwith one another, compatible with the demands and well-being of\nothers?\nClearly, neither of these points are to dowith \u2018quantities of external\ngoods\u2019, nor are they a matter of \u2018indulging desires\u2019 that (so it is pre-\nsumed) have nothing to do with a person\u2019s virtues. Instead, they\nconcern the degree of fulfilment and satisfaction in a person\u2019s life,\nbrought about by her own wise choices and characteristic projects,\nand through the relationships she pursues and enjoys. Rather than\nhappiness, understood merely as the satisfaction of whatever incli-\nnations a person happens to have, we might describe these rewards\nof virtue in terms of a person\u2019s flourishing.\nThese observations are preliminary to my main point, which\ncentres on the fact that flourishing depends upon others\u2019 cooperation.\nSince our question \u2013 our duties with regard to a proportionment of\n57\n\u2018Who are we to judge?\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nhappiness and virtue \u2013 concerns not only the dreams of the moralists,\nbut also our own intuitions, it may be question-begging to draw these\nresponses into play. Nonetheless, allow me to offer an example that\nillustrates at least my own sense of the matter. Imagine a brutal\nformer dictator, Augusto Pinochet say, lolling contentedly in his\nretirement home \u2013 or even happy in some hereafter. The picture is\nunappealing, but with some \u2013 rather informative \u2013 provisos I think\nwe may bear it with some equanimity. In the first place, I think we\nwould, as in Rashdall\u2019s initial question, have to imagine the simplest\nsort of hedonistic happiness \u2013 his being glutted to the point of stupe-\nfaction, for example, or dozing contentedly under a morphine drip.\nTo adapt Rashdall\u2019s language, he would be \u2018indulging desires\nwhich have no connection with his superior moral depravity\u2019.\nSecond, it could not be a situation where his satisfaction was\nserved, and ours denied, by the sight of those still active and influen-\ntial in the world treating him with respect, paying him court, defend-\ning or denying his crimes. Over and above this, what is quite\nintolerable is the thought of his still lording it tyrannically over\nothers without obstacle to his will \u2013 just that, of course, which\nseemed to constitute his own view of his flourishing in earlier life.\nIn other words, whatever we want to say about the doling out of\n\u2018happiness\u2019 understood in terms of quanta of pleasure, farmore press-\ning questions arise when we think of how people respond to the\nvicious and permit or deny their characteristic projects. Whether\nwe think of a person\u2019s own, perhaps corrupt, idea of a flourishing\nlife (thus my epigraph from Bernard Williams), or take a more objec-\ntive view of what it is to flourish22 \u2013 in either case, we do not think of a\nperson as merely \u2018indulging desires\u2019 quite independent of whatever\nhis vices or virtues may be. Flourishing is about pursuing valued pro-\njects, engaging in relationships we find worthwhile, obtaining\nsought-after satisfactions. As such, it hinges upon a person\u2019s own\nmoral sense, and it relies on others\u2019 assent and cooperation.\nIn the first place, my example highlights the obvious fact that the\nhappiness of the bad person, that is, his flourishing as he sees it, is\naltogether dangerous. One ingredient of wickedness is a picture of\none\u2019s well-being that is harmful or inattentive to the lives of others.\n22 Manymoralists would deny that the successful wrong-doer can flour-\nish, or even be happy. Plato, certainly, takes the point further, and sees cor-\nrection and punishment as actually contributing to the wrong-doer\u2019s\nwell-being. However this may be, it certainly departs from our usual, less\nmoralistic uses of these terms, and still more decisively from the wrong-\ndoer\u2019s own sense of the matter.\n58\nGarrath Williams\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nWhatever pleasures he might enjoy at no especial cost to others, the\nsatisfactions that he derives from pursuing his own moral sense and\nthe esteem that some accord him for this are indeed costly to\nothers. Denying the wicked the opportunity to flourish as they them-\nselves see it is a constraint upon wrong-doing \u2013 perhaps, finally, the\nmost important check there can be. By the same token, we have every\nreason to welcome the pleasures that the virtuous derive from pursu-\ning their characteristic projects, and the assistance and recognition\nthat (as we may hope) they receive in doing so.\nNonetheless, as my example suggests, we would be deluding our-\nselves if we suppose that vice will not enjoy cooperation and admira-\ntion. Pensioned-off tyrants have certainly found their unfair share of\nadmirers, and practising tyrants their supporters. Inasmuch as our\nflourishing depends on the cooperation of others, the vicious\nperson who flourishes enjoys the allegiance and, let us not deny it,\nrespect of many of those around him. Whatever we want to say\nabout the vicious person\u2019s \u2018happiness\u2019, it is certain that he does not\ndeserve respect for what he does and has done, inasmuch as we are\nbound to esteem virtuous action and disesteem its opposite.\nMy thought is this, then. The damage exacted by the vicious is not\nonly \u2018factual\u2019 \u2013 the cruelty, coercion, terror, and so forth that may be\nappropriate objects of formal punishment. (A question left aside in\nmy example.) Important as this is, when we think about the company\npeople keep and the ways in which they cooperate, we should also be\nconcerned by the possibilities for moral damage. Wickedness that\nflourishes spreads outwards, because it depends on others who permit\nit to flourish. This complicity may be bought or coerced, but as a rule\nit operates via lasting relationships and therefore depends on a catalogue\nof vices and failings: servility, cowardice, callousness, and so forth. The\ntyrant requires base and snivelling courtiers; as well as the suffering of\nhis victims, the bully needs their insecurities or others who will render\nthempowerless; the self-centred person requires others whowill endure\nhis impositions upon their legitimate wants and needs.\nThis returns us to the judgment of vice and virtue. Oneway in which\nthe wicked prosper is by banding together so that others are unable to\nresist \u2013 thus the example of tyranny. Another, more important in the\neveryday lives of relatively decent societies, is by people\u2019s failure to per-\nceive and appreciate the persons with whom they are dealing \u2013 or to\nchallenge those of whom they disapprove.23 To judge which actions\n23 See especially the closing paragraph to Hannah Arendt\u2019s lectures,\n\u2018Some Questions of Moral Philosophy\u2019 (in her Responsibility and\nJudgment, ed. Jerome Kohn, New York: Schocken, 2003), 145f.\n59\n\u2018Who are we to judge?\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nand initiatives ought to be supported or resisted requires us to discrimi-\nnate as to who proposes them, and to act on those judgments \u2013 above\nall, by persuading others to join in our views.\nIf we turn to the situation of the virtuous: just like the flourishing of\nthe vicious, so too the failure of the virtuous to flourish must offend.\nUnless we suppose that virtue is wholly to do with a world beyond,\nsomething the most otherworldly moralist has never claimed, the\nprojects of the virtuous will generally create moral or factual benefits\nor both. In the first place, to hinder their flourishing, not to support it\nas one may, is to frustrate these projects and to fail to recognise their\nworth.More than this, so far as they are enabled to act and to flourish,\nthe virtuous leave behind many debts \u2013 to those whom they benefit,\nto all of us who are reassured of humanity by such virtues as con-\nstancy, straightforwardness and clear-sighted concern for others.\nTo see such debts unpaid is indeed a dismal business. (Thus Kant:\ningratitude as one of the most detestable vices.24) This suggests\nanother basis for the moralists\u2019 dream of a just world. Mutuality,\nreciprocity, gratitude \u2013 duties at the heart of our status as relating\nbeings \u2013 leave us with obligations to the virtuous that we\nall-too-typically will not have to the vicious.\nThis may seem to have left behind the problems I discussed before,\nregarding our judgments of virtue, and the broader doubt as to\nwhether it is virtuous to judge and to share one\u2019s judgments with\nothers. Whether out of a sense of fairness or humility, or indeed reli-\ngious teachings, many people feel that our judgment of one another is\nan evil \u2013 perhaps a necessary evil, but an evil nonetheless. Nice\ngirls don\u2019t think ill of others, either because they think they\noughtn\u2019t, or \u2013 another difficulty we should not forget \u2013 because\nthey lack insight into the complexities and perversities of human\nmotivation and character. Against this way of viewing matters, I am\narguing that mutual accountability is essential if fallible human\nbeings are to achieve a decent and shared sense of what morality\ndemands.\nIV. Desert and suffering\nI hope enough has been said to indicate that we are not dealing with\nchildish fantasies here. Moderns convinced they are momentarily\nborne up by the caprice of an uncaring universe may be tempted to\nthink of the proportion of happiness to virtue as fairy-tale\n24 Metaphysics of Morals, 6:459.\n60\nGarrath Williams\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nwishfulness, like painting kind princesses beautiful and vicious\nstep-sisters ugly; and that we had better focus on improving welfare\nor happiness regardless of alleged deserts. In fact, we have very\ngood reasons to suppose that the virtuous should flourish and the\nwicked be frustrated. But I have emphasised that it is significant\nthat we should speak of flourishing and frustration here, rather than\nof happiness or quanta of displeasure.\nThis argument may not seem to speak to the question of desert,\ninasmuch as it looks broadly consequentialist. It will be better for\nus all if the wicked do not prosper, that virtue is recognised and\nflourishes \u2013 well, how could we have supposed otherwise? If desert\nenters the matter, it may seem to be in the merely analogical sense\nthat beauty deserves to be appreciated, ugliness not \u2013 so that the\n\u2018desert\u2019 in question concerns only the fittingness of our judgments.\nA first response would be to observe that this is by no means only a\nmatter of judgments \u2013 it concerns, of course, our responses too: the\npractical implication is that we should seek to share our judgments,\nso as to frustrate wickedness and promote virtue. Yet we may still\nfeel that desert has eluded us: is there any sense in which the wicked\nand the virtuous themselves deserve our responses? \u2013 Although an\naccount of desert is beyond my scope here, in this section I would\nlike to suggest one line of justification for desert claims \u2013 and in par-\nticular, for the idea that vice deserves to be met with suffering: not in\nthe \u2018pound of flesh\u2019 sense that Nietzsche derided in the theologians,\nbut in a more abstract sense that I shall specify shortly.\nAs George Sher has stressed, desert is a complex notion, compass-\ning awide variety of claims which are not all to be justified in the same\nway.25 Some desert claims arise from moral effort (e.g. gratitude),\nothers from work (e.g. wages), others from having suffered injury\nor bad luck (e.g. compensation), still others from having done\nwrong (e.g. blame) or breaking the law (e.g. punishment). While it\nis obvious that many of these claims are, if valid, congruent with a\nworldly interpretation of the claim, \u2018virtue deserves happiness\u2019,\n25 Sher\u2019sDesert, op. cit. note 7, remains the single most important study\nof this concept. He also discusses the proportionment of happiness to virtue,\nand argues that it is because the virtuous are worth more, that their happi-\nness should also be worth more to us. This seems to me to be open to\nRashdall\u2019s already cited objection, quoted by Sher himself, against\nthe case for any such proportionment: \u2018why [should] superior moral\ngoodness . . . be assigned a superior quantity of external goods, that is to\nsay, the means of indulging desires which have no connection with this\nsuperior moral goodness\u2019?\n61\n\u2018Who are we to judge?\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nnone of them actually takes such a general form. This should come as\nno surprise: we are never in the external position of a divine judge\nwho knows all there is to know about a person\u2019s conduct; almost\nalways, our judgment concerns how to continue our relations with\na person. For human beings, as relating beings, there is no \u2018last\njudgment\u2019.\nMore than this, however, it is part of modern common sense to\nsuppose that if we really knew everything there was to know about\na person, we should no longer think of her as really the source of\nher actions, but only as an especially complex nexus of causes and\neffects. Thus we resist the idea that the vicious deserve to suffer\n(perhaps linking this to a sense that their vices already stemmed\nfrom bad examples, bad company, bad experiences); we find it\ndifficult to accept that the virtuous are alone \u2018worthy of happiness\u2019\n(Kant); we may feel that it is bad for any person, no matter\nhow vicious, to suffer. Nonetheless \u2013 as Peter Strawson well\nemphasised \u2013 amid our continuing relations with one another, we\ngenerally find that such an \u2018objective\u2019 perspective is not one that we\ncan adopt; or at any rate, that to \u2018judge not\u2019 requires a real exercise\nof will.26\nOne reason for this is simple, but perhaps too little appreciated.\nSeveral authors have argued that if we are serious in thinking that a\nmoral norm ought to govern our lives together, we must believe\nthat its breach ought reasonably to be accompanied by sanctions of\nsome form or other, at least in the absence of the various excusing\nconditions.27 If we have the authority to pronounce on the norms\nthat should govern our interaction, then we must also have the\nauthority to ensure that those pronouncements are not without\neffect. When some people \u2013 wrong-doers \u2013 try to render moral\nnorms ineffectual, sanctions express and sustain a framework of\nmoral predictability that permits our stable, cooperative interaction\nwith others. Otherwise, our only certainty would be that those who\nhonoured moral demands would be at the mercy of those prepared\nto breach them.\n26 \u2018Freedom and Resentment,\u2019 Proceedings of the British Academy 48\n(1962), 1\u201325, and variously reprinted.\n27 The most succinct statement of this view is Herbert Fingarette,\n\u2018Retributive Punishment\u2019 in his Mapping Responsibility (Chicago: Open\nCourt, 2004). It is also at work in H. L. A. Hart\u2019s celebrated essay, \u2018Legal\nResponsibility and Excuses\u2019, in his Punishment and Responsibility: Essays\nin the Philosophy of Law (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968).\n62\nGarrath Williams\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nIn previous sections, however, I have also stressed the difficulties of\nmoral judgment, and argued that wrong-doing is rarely as simple as\nwe like to think. Vices generally involve distortions of judgment as\nto what morality demands of people. This clearly makes it more dif-\nficult to maintain such a moral framework, and to be sure of our auth-\nority to pronounce on it: None of us has any a priori certainty of our\ncompetence to adjudicate it. My central claim is that this fallibility\nalso makes mutual judgment more urgent for us, and not \u2013 as we\nmight first think \u2013 something we lack the authority to engage in.\nI spoke, above, of the \u2018moral damage\u2019 involved when vice is allowed\nto flourish. Part of my thought was this: when people act, their\nactions do not merely make a physical difference. Actions also set\nan example \u2013 that is, they help to establish, to reproduce and some-\ntimes to alter our moral expectations of one another.28 When we\ninteract with someone over time \u2013 someone, let us say, with a\ntendency to cut certain moral corners \u2013 our failure to judge actually\nconstitutes a judgment of sorts, just as their actions effectively consti-\ntute a judgment about how we should relate to one another. In prac-\ntice, a failure to judge represents an endorsement of that mode of\nacting, or at least a permission so to act. It becomes more likely that\nwe will act similarly, or that others will; at any rate, we furnish part\nof the space in which wrong-doing flourishes. If we judge a way of\nacting to be wrong, and if we take the moral standard concerned to\nbe authoritative, then whatever else we do, we cannot simply continue\nto interact approvingly with the actor. Somehow or other, we must\ndeny that her example and initiative embody the standards we\nshould expect of one another.\nThere are obviously many different ways in which we can refuse\nthe wrong-doer\u2019s example and the precedent it might otherwise set:\npunishment, reproach, the marshalling of peer pressure, the ending\nof relations, setting the action aside as a \u2018moment of madness\u2019, and\nso forth. (Of course, in any given case, power relations may leave\nus unable to respond in some or all of these ways. And as I have\nstressed, we often have to persuade others of our judgments if a\nresponse is to be effective.) Leaving aside the penalties that are\ninvolved in some of these responses, I want to point out that all of\nthem have an internal relation to suffering, in its most elementary\n28 See Tamar Schapiro, \u2018Three Conceptions of Action in Moral\nTheory,\u2019 Nou\u02c6s 35 (2001), 93\u2013117 \u2013 in particular, the \u2018Kantian\u2019 account of\naction that she develops there. On our use of the arsenal of mutual account-\nability not only to reproduce but also to redefine expectations, see Cheshire\nCalhoun, \u2018Responsibility and Reproach,\u2019 Ethics 99 (1989), 389 \u2013 406.\n63\n\u2018Who are we to judge?\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nsense of enduring.29 Instead of seeing her initiative taken up and\nendorsed as a valid way of relating to others, the wrong-doer \u2013 that is,\nthewrong-doerwhomwerecognise as such \u2013 sees her initiative rejected.\nTo the extent that others take up my judgment, she suffers the fact that\nothers\u2019 wills determine the standards governing our lives together.\nI am suggesting, then, that it is a basic and inevitable feature of\nhuman interaction that each of us continually contributes to the mor-\nality that we actually live by \u2013 whether we realise it or not, whether we\nconsciously judge one another or not. Finite and imperfect as we are,\nit is part of our finitude that we must relate to one another, and that\nin doing so we set the terms of those relations. This is as true of\nwrong-doing that is not condemned as it is of acts that we endorse\nas virtuous. For this reason, when we judge someone to have\nadvanced distorted or corrupt norms by her actions, we are always\n\u2013 if we are indeed committed to that judgment \u2013 also committed to\nthe assumption that she deserves badly. Here, I do not try to justify\nthe familiar, practical manifestations of this assumption: that those\nwho act badly should be punished,30 blamed, or made to compensate.\nInstead, I am pointing to a more abstract idea that underlies all of\nthese practices: By our judgments of one another\u2019s actions, and by\ndrawing others into these judgments, we ensure that those prepared\nto do wrong do not set the terms on which we relate to one another.\nSo far as some prove incorrigible in their vices, this picture has a\ndifficult relation to ideas of equality and fairness. Calvin once made\nthe stunning claim, \u2018For not all are created in equal condition.\u201931\nHe meant that while some were predestined to hell, others were\ngranted grace and predestined to heaven. The sheer unfairness of\nsuch a view \u2013 to most human eyes, at any rate \u2013 often leads us to\ntemper our desert claims. Even secular writers often express this\nthought with the words, \u2018There but for the grace of God go I.\u2019\n(Meaning: there, but for the harsh upbringing, the bad company,\nthe dire circumstances \u2013 et cetera \u2013 go we all.) The words have a\ncliche\u00b4d quality, and I am not sure we always appreciate the moral\nlogic involved. God\u2019s \u2018grace\u2019 stands in for another contention, one\nmuch less suited to the modern sense of egalitarian justice that\n29 Herbert Fingarette, \u2018Suffering,\u2019 in his Mapping Responsibility,\nop. cit. note 27.\n30 Cf.

No doubt this is unfair. If we take seriously our\nstatus as relating beings, however, we should see that there is a coun-\ntermanding question \u2013 albeit one that we more rarely think to ask:\nDoes a person deserve a right to set the terms on which we live with\nher? I think the answer is clear: none of us deserves this right,\nexcept insofar as our actions and example do indeed merit others\u2019\napproval or admiration.\nConclusion\nI began with the difficulties involved in imagining our relation to an\nauthority that is so superior to us that it could perfectly match happi-\nness to virtue. What we do experience, instead, are our relations to\nothers. My argument has been that we are morally bound to judge\none another \u2013 and hence pursue a complex proportion between hap-\npiness and virtue, between vice and suffering \u2013 in order to lend auth-\nority to morality so far as we are able to discern it. We must judge\nprecisely because of our fallibility and our relationality: the fact\nthat we depend on one another, not only materially, but also\nmorally, in achieving a proper sense of the terms on which we\nshould live together. In other words: the ideal of a proportionment\nbetween happiness and virtue commands our attention because we\nare so related to one another. For we are not immune \u2013 as an infall-\nible, punitive Godmight be \u2013 to the effects, moral as well as material,\nof one another\u2019s ways of being in the world. By the same token, we\ngenerally lack the power \u2013 as God does not \u2013 to bring our judgments\nto bear. To limit a person\u2019s readiness to act viciously we must judge,\nand respond, with others.\nDespite the emphasis I have placed on the difficulties ofmoral judg-\nment, I have also taken for granted some fairly general claims about the\nnature of vice and virtue \u2013 that many virtues are essential to quality in\nhuman relationships and involve wider benefits both in their effects\nand in their example (and vice versa, so to speak). I have only suggested\nthat a significant part of vice consists in failure to appreciatewhat these\ndemandsmean, as amatter of practical judgment.The vicious not only\n(in Kant\u2019s words) seek to exempt themselves from such demands, but\nalso persistentlymisjudge them: finding their own happiness in activi-\nties that harm others and undermine virtue, promoting the initiatives\nof those who do similarly, and \u2013 not least \u2013 seeking to hold others\naccountable on the wrong terms.\n65\n\u2018Who are we to judge?\u2019\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Jun 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThis systematic frailty of human judgment might lead us to fear\nthat we are inadequate to the task of realising any sort of proportion-\nment of happiness to virtue, perhaps even to dream of just deserts that\nreach out beyond the grave. But desert is hardly so clear or compelling\na concept that it can tell us about another world32 \u2013 and certainly not\nabout a world where we are authors of our moral selves entire, a world\nwhere all aspects of virtue can be summed together and all aspects of\nvice neatly subtracted, a world where each individual\u2019s resulting sum\ncan be matched by a machine-like deus doling out just deserts.\nInstead, I have tried to trace a complex logic that may justify a\nmore modest and more urgent interpretation of this idea.\nHappiness, understood in relation to flourishing and successful\nactivity, requires others\u2019 cooperation, support and admiration \u2013 the\nproper rewards of virtue. I have not dwelt on particular sanctions\nthat should attend vicious conduct, but have emphasised a particular,\nabstract sense of the suffering that should attend vice: the failure\nto see one\u2019s example taken up and endorsed, and hence an inability\nto set the terms of one\u2019s relationships with others. To take morality\nseriously is to be committed to these proportionments of happiness\nand virtue, of vice and suffering. If we would be virtuous, we have\nno business in abstaining from judgment, be it out of a sense of fair-\nness or for some other reason. For that would be to surrender moral-\nity\u2019s authority, by making way for misjudgments about its content\nand demands.\nA starry-eyed idealist might dream of a world where all are virtu-\nous; the moralists dreamed of a future world where just deserts\nwere dealt out by an ideal judge. When we face this world, we must\nconfront the task of deciding whose initiatives, whose projects,\nwhose example should flourish, and whose should founder. Our\nfallibility, our inequality, our interdependence \u2013 together, these\nlend our judgment of one another its urgency and importance.33\nLancaster University\n32 And this is very close to Kant\u2019s view: the idea of virtue as the \u2018worthi-\nness to be happy\u2019 is the supposedly self-evident presupposition from which\nhe constructs the postulates of pure practical reason, including God and\nimmortality: Critique of Practical Reason, 5:122ff.\n33 My thanks to colleagues in the Department of Philosophy, Lancaster\nUniversity for their comments on earlier versions of this paper, and to an\nanonymous referee of another journal for especially thorough comments.\n66\nGarrath Williams\n"}
