The oldest sibling, a girl, died in adolescence, and the youngest sibling\ndied as a baby. The family had been known to social services for some time and\nwere described as \u2018a feral gang\u2019. The neglect in the family was severe, such that in\nher early years Helen had little or no education, and often went unclothed and\nunfed.\nWhen she was four and a half years old she was placed into foster care, with five of her\nsiblings. She had a number of short-term placements, until at five years of age she was\nplaced with the Saunders family. The Saunders family consists of Mr and Mrs Saunders\nand Mrs Saunders\u2019 daughter, who has special education needs and is two years older\nthan Helen. Mrs Saunders\u2019 mother, known as Nan, is closely involved and lives nearby.\nThe family have two pet dogs who are very much part of the family.\nOnce settled into this more long-term placement, Helen was referred to the CAMHS\nservice where I work, although this was still quite a distance from where she lived and\nshe was brought in a taxi, accompanied by Nan.\nFollowing assessment, she was offered psychotherapy three times weekly, and by\nthis time she was six years old. A therapist worked with Helen for 18 months, but then\nunfortunately this therapist left the clinic. I took over the case and began seeing her,\nalso three times per week. This session reported below took place very early on in the\ntherapy; Helen was eight years old at the time.\nHelen has always engaged passionately with the therapeutic process. She uses\neverything available in order to communicate her preoccupations \u2013 myself, the room,\nthe furniture and her toy box. She has a vivid imagination and is interested in music\nand drama. The sessions are thus generally highly dramatic in every sense of the\nword.\nThe major themes she is exploring in therapy are those of deprivation and abuse \u2013 key\nthemes from her early life. She is an observant girl, with an excellent memory. She is\nable to use actual memories of her early abuse and weave them into her \u2018stories and\nplays\u2019. I often play the part of the abused victim, where she is in identification with the\nabuser. In this way, I feel, she attempts to take some control over her damaged internal\nworld.\nJOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOTHERAPY\nVOL. 33 NO. 2 2007 239 \u2013 255\nJournal of Child Psychotherapy\nISSN 0075-417X print\/ISSN 1469-9370 online \u00aa 2007 Association of Child Psychotherapists\nhttp:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals DOI: 10.1080\/00754170701437146\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nFirst session back after the first Christmas break\nMonday\u2019s session was cancelled as the taxi didn\u2019t arrive.\nAt the next session, Helen was still in the toilet when I arrived to collect her. Nan said\nthey\u2019d had a new taxi driver, adding (resentfully) that she had had to direct him! Helen\nemerged and Nan asked me if I\u2019d had a nice holiday. Helen said, \u2018We didn\u2019t, C, me and\nNan all had a stomach bug and F is still ill with a cold.\u2019 Helen seemed to want to chat\nabout this for a bit and I felt was making a bridge over the holiday gap. She then turned\nher head and ran for the room. I followed and when entering the room did my usual\nthing as she hid under the sofa, leaving a chair in a different position as, I said, \u2018a clue to\nfind you\u2019.\nShe then spent a few minutes telling me she\u2019d been hurt by Sandra at school. \u2018She\nscratched me with a pencil,\u2019 Helen said, and showed me the mark on her lip and finger.\nI said she was telling me how she felt hurt and asked why Sandra did this. \u2018Because she\nthought I was taking her friend away so I played with \u2014\u2019 and she listed three boys.\nI said she was telling me about people who get angry if something or someone is taken\naway from them, and wondered aloud whether she was also thinking about not seeing\nme over the holidays. Did it feel like she\u2019d also had something taken away, I asked?\nShe ignored this and said, \u2018I was thinking about what we\u2019d got up to in the taxi \u2013\nwhere was the \u2014?\u2019 and she listed furniture and the blanket. We (mainly she) gradually\nremembered and I said that she wanted to carry on as if there wasn\u2019t the holiday in\nbetween; she nodded. She then said, \u2018But now it\u2019s Part 2,\u2019 and I said that she knew we\u2019d\nhad one term of work and this was our second term. As she moved furniture she said,\n\u2018I\u2019m strong, Elsa [previous therapist] thought I was strong. She told F and F told me.\u2019\nI said that she was telling me she knew I had good thoughts about her, and she\u2019d had\nholiday breaks with Elsa and knew she and Elsa could hold on to the good things\nbetween them, and she hoped she and I could do this as well after our first holiday\nbreak.\nThen she lay down across the sofa and chair, covered in the blanket, and said she was\nthe boy tiger Jonathan asleep (as last time) with Emma the dolphin, and I as Jonathan\u2019s\ngirlfriend had to come. She then told me she didn\u2019t love me any more. In play, I cried\nabout this, at which she (as Jonathan) relented and (as before) said Jonathan loved both\nof us. I spoke about me needing to know how sad it was to feel rejected and not loved,\nbut she didn\u2019t want this feeling around for long. She then lay sleeping between her two\ngirlfriends, who she introduced to each other. I asked whether L would be jealous of\nEmma. \u2018No, they don\u2019t mind,\u2019 she said. I, as Lauren the human mother, had to take a\nphoto of the three of them. As I did so, I said that the photo was like a memory, that she\nwanted to have a picture in her mind of being loved and wanted by two girlfriends, like\nshe was the special one in between. I then added that perhaps this also linked with her\nhaving had two therapists, who she hoped both cared about her and made her feel\nspecial.\nShe then changed her position, so that she now lay the other way round. She pushed\nthe chair so there was now a gap between sofa and chair, which I described and linked to\nthe holiday gap. She fell down it in a controlled way and lay there \u2018sleeping\u2019, saying she\nwas having a nice dream. I said that she\u2019d fallen down the gap but it didn\u2019t seem to be a\n240 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\ndisaster, and maybe she was telling me she had managed the holiday gap peacefully too.\nThen she began to writhe, saying, \u2018I\u2019m having a bad dream,\u2019 but she didn\u2019t know what it\nwas about, except \u2018a bug has got into my hair. You have to take it off and stamp on it\nand kill it.\u2019 I took the bug off and asked why it needed to be killed. \u2018If you don\u2019t, it\u2019ll get\nin my hair again.\u2019 I said that even in a peaceful sleep she got disturbed by buglike things\nthat got in and turned things bad, and I linked this to the holiday and her having to\nstamp on\/kill buglike others that I might have seen and who disturbed her.\nShe then began chasing around the room on all fours in quite a desperate way, saying\nshe was looking for little frogs to eat. I said it looked like she was frightened and being\nchased by something scary. She hid behind my chair and it felt like she was hiding from\nme, so I said that perhaps she felt she had to hide from me and that maybe I was part of\nher bad dream. \u2018No,\u2019 she said, emerging, and then continued chasing the frogs. \u2018There\u2019s\nlots of them,\u2019 she said. Then she stood up and gracefully flapped her arms, asking,\n\u2018Guess what I am now?\u2019 I said, \u2018A bird,\u2019 and she flapped around a bit and said she was\nmaking the \u2018biggest nest ever\u2019 as she folded the blanket on the floor. She told me there\nwere eight eggs in it and wrapped herself and the eggs in the nest. I said perhaps she was\nshowing me how she coped with the bad things about the holidays. She made herself in\ncharge of the nest and eggs to make sure she had a safe place to be, and it was she who\nhad the eggs so she wouldn\u2019t have to kill the bugs and frogs and other children that\nmight get into my mind in the holidays. The eggs began multiplying in number\nfrantically as she continued to fly gracefully and nest-build, and I remarked what hard\nwork it was to keep all this going. She then \u2018magicked\u2019 me so I could fly with her and\nsaid, \u2018You and girls can fly but not men.\u2019 Then she said that she had to defend her nest\nagainst the horrible man, and flapped viciously. I said she needed to make sure no man\nwas near the nest or in my mind, and she\u2019d do all she could to keep that man away. It\nwas soon the end of the session and she was annoyed about this, saying, \u2018It\u2019s not fair,\u2019\nbut she allowed me to help her leave.\nFirst session following the Easter break\nIn the waiting room, Helen was hiding behind the chair by the door. She jumped out\nwhen I said I was there. She had something to show me \u2013 a Barbie heart in a packet\ncontaining lots of rings. I was only allowed a quick look, then she put them back into\nNan\u2019s bag and ran off, only to return saying she\u2019d forgotten her fleece, with which she\nswished me, and she bounced out of the waiting room. I felt very pleased to see her\nagain.\nShe had moved \u2018my\u2019 chair a few feet and hidden under the sofa, clutching her fleece.\nShe told me to look there, and I was thinking that as before I would see a kitten, but she\nmade a \u2018woof\u2019 sound to let me know it was a dog, a puppy holding a fleece. I asked\nwhere Helen was, and was told she still had fleas so couldn\u2019t come as she had to have her\nhair seen to. I expressed sadness at this, after such a long time apart over the holidays,\nand so I had to be the one who couldn\u2019t see who she wanted. I took on the kitten\/puppy\npart as she instructed: she said that she had my (pretend) fleece and she\u2019d taken it and I\nhad to chase her. I was not allowed to catch her. She said she had cut her leg and it was\nbleeding and I had to call the ambulance. She made it clear that I was not allowed to\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 241\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nhelp or go near her or she would scratch me. I commented on being kept at bay, not\nable to be helpful to her at the moment, and how I was to feel robbed of my fleece that\nshould keep me warm. I said I was robbed and in the cold.\nHelen then took some keys out of her fleece pocket and told me they were the keys to\nher back door. She had been allowed to lock it when she left for Nan\u2019s (no school today,\nso arrangements appeared to be a bit different). She said this proudly, and then taunted\nme with the keys, saying I could not get them and nor could the ambulance people who\nI had called to help me and her. I spoke again of having to feel robbed of something\nimportant, and linked this to the holidays and how I felt she was showing me what it\nwas like not to be able to have something I wanted and needed \u2013 like the keys and the\nfleece. I added that she had also shown me rings in the waiting room and I was to know\nthat she had all these things that I did not.\nShe then said, \u2018Now I\u2019m Emma, your daughter,\u2019 and she sat on the upturned bin\nand began to pretend to cry. In answer to my question, she said, \u2018I\u2019ve come back\nhome, my boyfriend broke up with me because he said I\u2019m a stupid little madam\u2019\n(and she showed me her \u2018little madam\u2019 T-shirt). In the game I was to be pleased to\nsee her and also able to read in her eyes why she was crying. I said that she was\nshowing me how sad she could get over separations, and asked whether the holiday\nbetween us felt like this, and whether I should be able to see it from her eyes. She\nthen jangled the keys and I had to ask: \u2018Have you got the keys?\u2019 She replied, \u2018Yes, I\nfound them on the floor.\u2019 She gave me the keys, saying I could only touch the\nyellow (plastic) part, not the silver (metal) part, and I had to put them in the bin\nwith her shoes, and I had to do it until I got it right and touched the right part.\nShe was quickly aggressive if I got anything the slightest bit wrong; I said that I had\nto get things just right, especially after the two-week holiday, so she would know she\nhad a place with me. At one point she took the keys, covered herself with the\nblanket and said she was a ghost, and that I was to ask it for the keys and I was to\nbe refused and frightened. I said that not only could I not have my keys back but\nI was to feel alone and frightened too \u2013 very small against the frightening ghost.\nI added that perhaps she was telling me about her worries of ghosts getting in here\nor into me over the holidays.\nThen I was to be John, the boyfriend, coming back to say sorry to Emma. I did this\nand was at first refused and told Emma loved someone else. Then I spoke about left-out\nfeelings, then being accepted back, except that the little puppy might not let me stroke it\nas it did not know me. I said that she wanted us to be back together as before the\nholidays, but there were still some difficulties in trusting.\nThen, as the little puppy asleep, she lay on the blanket and I as John had to stroke\nher, wrap her up and put her fleece over her. She allowed me to do this and I said that\nthe little side of her wanted to be looked after and felt that I could do this now. She got\nup suddenly and I (as John), with Emma, had to admire her dancing etc. \u2013 a bit like last\nterm. She then pretended to dive into some water, saying, \u2018Your pond has all flowed out\nfrom the garden into this room towards me, I\u2019m diving in to find the fishes who can\nplay,\u2019 and she mimed a number of musical instruments that I had to guess. I spoke of\nher being the one who we all had to admire and look up to, who would have it all: the\nwater, the fish and the dancing.\n242 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nI then had to dive into the pond to find her; I did not find the puppy, but instead a\nbaby dolphin into which she had transformed herself. She continued to be the baby\ndolphin for the rest of the session, getting Emma (me) to \u2018ride\u2019 on her back, then doing\nmore spectacular feats such as flying while I watched her. She had some wild animals\ncome into the play \u2013 first the tiger, which she said I must persuade her was friendly. She\nthen happily played with it, licking her tummy as she lay on her back making \u2018happy\u2019\ndolphin sounds and wriggling her legs. She then growled at a window and said it was a\nlion: this time I was to say that lions eat baby dolphins and she in the game did not\nknow whether to believe me or not. I said there was the problem of trusting me back\nagain, near the end of the session. Could I keep her safe or was I not to be trusted?\nIt was quite hard to get her to leave, then as we were about to leave she said, \u2018I won\u2019t\nbe coming on Thursday, then things have to change in September.\u2019 It was time to stop.\nCommentary by Sheila Miller, child and adolescent psychotherapist,\nTavistock Clinic, London\nFor child psychotherapists working in CAMHS, Helen\u2019s history and circumstances will\nbe only too familiar but will always remain deeply upsetting. Since the 1970s, when\nchildren \u2018in care\u2019 began to be offered long-term psychotherapy, referrals have risen\nsteadily and now form a substantial portion of most therapists\u2019 case loads. Although\nsome rethinking has been necessary in relation to timing and the \u2018grammar and syntax\nof interpretation\u2019 (Alvarez, 1997; Boston and Szur, 1983), a psychoanalytic approach\nhas proved viable. We have also learned that it is a slow process and that the work is\ntaxing for therapists due to the mental pain that is projected, often concretely, in the\nform of physical acting out in sessions.\nHelen\u2019s history is stark and sparse. Reading the detail brings to mind the question of\njust how much helpful understanding can be gained from such a known history. We are\naware of the effects that trauma and deprivation invariably have on neurological,\ncognitive and emotional development, and experience shows that the specific details of\nthe events are important, as well as how these have been internalised. Thinking about\nwhat is known can help us to gain some impression of the child\u2019s experience and what\none might expect. In sessions, of course, this needs to be put at the periphery of the\nmind so that contact between child and therapist remains central, with all that this\nimplies. There is also the important question, especially applicable in fostering and\nadoption cases, of how much external information can be addressed usefully in sessions.\nThis is of particular interest here as Helen has conscious memories of her early abuse.\nIn this instance it seems important that the siblings in Helen\u2019s large family were\nknown as a \u2018feral gang\u2019, suggesting some kind of closeness \u2013 even if an unholy alliance.\nThe impact of the deaths of two siblings, and of being separated from the five others\nwith whom she was taken into care, is relevant.

She has\nengaged with the therapist, who follows her sensitively and participates in her games\nwhile bearing the meaning of the material in mind. In several instances she notes a\ntransference connection, but wisely waits for more information or an appropriate\nmoment before interpreting. The accounts of the sessions carefully detail the content\nbut give little information about the emotional temperature in the session, and no\ninformation about the impact of the material on the therapist herself.\nIt is interesting to have two post-break sessions instead of the usual one, thus\nproviding a constant factor, but this also limits the detail with which the material can be\nfollowed. I shall therefore concentrate on tracing some patterns in the two sessions, but\ncannot do justice to the material or to the work of the therapist.\nAfter the Christmas break\nThe first session had to be cancelled because of a transport problem.\nWhen the therapist goes to fetch Helen, she is in the toilet; she emerges urgently\nneeding to communicate to her therapist that she, and in fact the whole family, have not\nhad a good holiday. They have all been ill and not everyone has yet recovered. The\ntherapist notes this, thinking to herself that Helen is trying to bridge the gap. She holds\non to the thought and uses it later in the session. I think there is a more desperate note\nto the communication, and that this is heightened by the missed session in addition to\nthe planned holiday. Interestingly this is the first of several instances where Helen brings\nmental pain in the guise of physical symptoms, as do many children who are\ntraumatised or have suffered early deprivation.\nIn the play room, as soon as she is implanted under the couch, Helen follows this up\nwith the story about Sandra scratching her. The therapist listens, and then comments\nthat Helen felt hurt, thus acknowledging the external event as well as the mental\nexperience being expressed. She then enquires about the incident, thereby allowing\nherself to get a sense of what emotions might be involved, before linking it to the\nholiday. This seems the right pace for Helen but the level of intensity is not always\ninterpreted.\nAs the session proceeds the therapist alludes appropriately to many aspects of the\nimpact of the break: anger, rejection, sadness, sibling rivalry, omnipotent control and an\noedipal theme. In her comments she shows that she understands many of the lessons\nthat have been learned in working with severely deprived children, for example that\nreceptive interpretations work better than probing ones, and that anger needs to be\ninterpreted carefully so the child does not feel it has been put into her. Many of the\ninterpretations lead to contact between patient and therapist, but some of Helen\u2019s\nresponses suggest that the level is a bit too low-key and that the intensity and more\ndisturbed material have not been addressed. Following the first interpretation framed as\na question \u2013 did it feel like she\u2019d also had something taken away? \u2013 Helen does not\n244 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nrespond directly but makes a cryptic comment about \u2018what we got up to in the taxi\u2019,\nwhich suggests that she has something more nefarious in mind. This is not followed up\nand the next interpretation is along the lines of bridging the gap, although the material\nabout listing the furniture etc. could refer to a more acute worry about robbery. Helen\nthen remembers that her previous therapist had thought she was strong, which the\ntherapist takes as Helen \u2018knowing\u2019 that she, like Elsa, has good thoughts about her.\nHelen responds to this by taking the identity of tiger boy Jonathan and the therapist\nis assigned to be his girlfriend. What follows is a tale, apparently oft-repeated, of\nrejection and reconciliation in adolescent mode. Roles fluctuate between therapist and\nHelen, recounted by the therapist in a way that is difficult to follow. This material could\nbe understood as a developmental step in trying on identities, but seems instead to be\nlinked to Helen\u2019s not having a stable identity as a latency girl. Preoccupations which are\nnot age-appropriate are frequent when children have not had a protected childhood\nwhich ensures a gradual pace of growing up. As she is the seventh of 10 children, the\nolder members of the feral gang were undoubtedly teenagers, with all that implies about\nwhat she was exposed to.\nThere is a brief moment when the therapist is assigned a maternal role. This follows\nthe interpretation of sadness, rejection and a sense of not being loved. It does not last,\nI think because the focus is then placed on the two girlfriends, who are linked with two\ntherapists who think she is special. What is lost is the need for the therapist\/mother to\nkeep the picture of Helen in her mind.\nHelen changes position, saying she is having a good dream. The therapist does not\ntake this up as a defence, but as an indication that the holiday was all right, in\ncontradiction to what has gone before. But Helen is a persistent child, and so she brings\nher bad dream of the invasive bug in her hair which she is desperate for the therapist to\nkill. The interpretation given about fury towards other patients is apt, but Helen, rather\nthan being relieved, launches into a manic chase which involves the proliferation of\nfrogs, which is echoed in the material about the eggs. She loses touch with reality and\nretreats into magic. It is the fluctuation of identities, together with the splitting of the\npersecutory objects, which concerns me. These seem related to an intolerance of\nseparation from the object, and not having had the opportunity in her life to establish an\ninternal good object.\nAfter Easter\nAlthough there are clearly developments in this session, a similar pattern can be traced.\nThe puppy material is understood and the interpretation allows for working\nthrough some important anxieties. It is the Helen who cannot attend because she\nhas fleas who is not heard. The therapist commented earlier that Helen had left a\nclue to indicate where she was hiding. I think Helen is adept at clues; the stomach\n\u2018bug\u2019 mentioned in the waiting room recurs in the bad dream, and now has\nproliferated so that Helen is infested. There is a hint that the puppy has a similar\nproblem, in an unconscious pun, \u2018fleece\u2019. In the verbal play that follows, switching\nof identities recurs and the lack of separation is evident in the telling statement,\n\u2018Your pond has all flowed out from the garden into this room towards me,\u2019 which is\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 245\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nfollowed by material which shows many confusions and some terror about whether\nbabies will be devoured. This suggests a process of excessive and uncontained\nprojective identification. All this made me wonder whether Helen\u2019s earlier comment\nthat Elsa thought she was strong was an unconscious communication to her\ntherapist that she could be a bit braver in taking up the persecutory material \u2013 that\nshe needs the confidence that the therapist can deal with Helen as well as the more\nbenign puppy. I would by no means discourage the therapist from participating in\nthe games, which are so important to Helen, but attention needs to be given to\nwhen these promote understanding and working through, and when there is a\nrepetitive quality of merely escaping mental pain. Unless the interpretation is firmer,\nthe therapist\u2019s continued compliance with the shifting identities will not assist the\nestablishment of a strong maternal transference and hence internalisation of a good\nobject.\nAlthough crucial to this exercise, it is frustrating not to be able to talk to the therapist,\nwhich highlights the importance of live interactive supervision. Some of the matters I\nwould have liked to discuss are whether the foster family were offered help and some\ndetails about the transfer, as the only reference to it was taken up in rather bland terms.\nIn particular, it would be helpful to know the impact of the material on the therapist as,\nso often, the countertransference is such a useful tool.\nJudging by the therapist\u2019s introductory remarks that Helen used the toy box as well as\nverbal games relating to her conscious memories, these two sessions do not seem typical.\nHelen did not use the toys or draw in either, which suggests that her latency identity\nwas either not stable or that it fragmented as a result of breaks. At the end of the session\nafter Easter, Helen commented that that she would not be coming on Thursday and\nthat things must change in September, which left unclear whether she has been told that\ntherapy would be ending then or whether this is her fear.\nShe has had a generous amount of time, but much work remains to be done and I\nhope the treatment can continue for some while. Given her history, Helen is a resilient\nchild and her enthusiasm for the therapy is a tribute to her therapist. There is, however,\nan underlying thread of disturbed material which will need to be confronted by the\ntherapist if Helen is to reach her potential.\n11 Thornbury House\nThornbury Square\nLondon N6 5YW\nUK\ne-mail: sheila.miller1@virgin.net\nReferences\nALVAREZ, A.

I believe she likes and\nrespects Helen, and Helen is aware of her therapist\u2019s regard for her. For her part,\nHelen is actively using the therapy, likes her therapist and wants to trust her. She has\nmade an adaptive transition to her current therapist, despite the loss of her original\ntherapist. All these things tell me the therapeutic process is progressing as we might\nhope.\nThis commentary, therefore, will focus on some aspects of Helen\u2019s language and\nbehaviour that are typical of children whose earliest experiences include chronic\nphysical, sexual and emotional abuse, as well as extreme physical neglect. These life-\nthreatening experiences have a profound effect on the developing infant brain, and, of\ncourse, on the development of a sense of self in the child. I believe knowledge of the\nimpact of abuse and neglect on development can inform our psychotherapeutic\ntreatment of children.\nThe importance of details of an early history of neglect and abuse\nHelen is described as the seventh child of 10 in a family social services referred to as a\n\u2018feral gang\u2019. We know that her eldest sibling, a girl, died in adolescence, and that an\ninfant also died. Until the age of four and a half Helen \u2018often went unclothed and\nunfed\u2019. At that point, she and five of her siblings were placed in foster care. At age five,\nafter several short-term placements, Helen was placed in a long-term foster home, with a\ncouple and their seven-year-old, special needs daughter. The foster mother\u2019s mother\nlived nearby and was very involved with the family.\nReading this, I found myself wishing for more factual detail to help me consider\npossible meaning in Helen\u2019s play and interactions with her therapist. I wondered exactly\nhow Helen\u2019s older sibling died, and what knowledge of that death Helen might have.\nWhat is known of Helen\u2019s relationship with her older sister? Were there allegations of\nabuse associated with her death or the infant\u2019s? Did Helen see either of her siblings after\nthey had died? Did Helen attend either of the funerals? What was she told about her\nbaby sibling\u2019s death? How soon after the second death were the children removed from\ntheir home?\nI am well aware that the answers to these and similar questions are often lacking in\ncases such as Helen\u2019s, which is often frustrating for a therapist, but whatever\ndocumented information is available regarding a child\u2019s actual history of loss, neglect,\nabuse or traumatic experience will help the therapist differentiate trauma re-enactment\nplay from other types of play later on. This knowledge can inform treatment planning.\nKnowing a child\u2019s interpersonal trauma history can also help one to recognise and\nunderstand one\u2019s own countertransference responses to a patient\u2019s behaviour. When\nproviding psychotherapy for a child with a history of violent interpersonal trauma, it is\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 247\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nuseful to hold in mind the possibility that play behaviours can be re-enactments of real\ntraumatic experience, while appearing to be metaphoric.\nAttachment strategies and procedural memory in neglected and\/or abused\nchildren\nDespite her history of multiple losses, neglect and abuse, Helen demonstrates the\ncapacity to form appropriate attachments to care-giving adults and is engaged in the\nbuilding of a relationship with her new therapist. This ability on her part leads me to\nbelieve that sometime earlier, perhaps in an attachment to a sibling, she experienced a\nmutually caring relationship. She seems capable of expressing needs and, importantly,\nbelieves another will recognise and respond to those needs. Interpersonal controlling\nbehaviour may be the result of multiple abusive relationships in which she felt terrified.\nMuch of Helen\u2019s behaviour illustrates the way in which traumatic, disorganised, infant\nattachments often develop into role-reversed, controlling attachments, as the child\nbecomes both mobile and verbal (Glaser, 2003; Main and Solomon, 1990).\nThe ability to imitate and reproduce interpersonal behaviours, either experienced\npersonally or simply witnessed, is a well-documented aspect of the attachment process.\nWe are a social species, designed to learn how to interact with others by observing,\nexperiencing and responding to the behaviour of those around us from our earliest days\nof life (Bowlby, 1969). A particular non-verbal type of human memory, referred to as\nprocedural memory, facilitates this human capacity to imitate both roles in observed\nhuman interactions (Grigsby and Hartlaub, 1994). Unlike declarative memory, which\ncan be recalled and spoken (if one chooses to do so), procedural memory is a non-\nconscious record of one\u2019s physical experience in the environment. Procedural knowledge\nmay or may not be connected with conscious awareness. While declarative memory\nmust develop over time, procedural memory is designed to enhance survival, and is\nfunctional from birth.\nSince the publication of Terr\u2019s (1984) article on the typical play of traumatised\nchildren, many studies have demonstrated a close correspondence between the repetitive\nplay of abused and\/or neglected children in psychotherapy and the actual experiences\nthe children had lived through. In particular, some play-like behaviours can be literal re-\nenactments of traumatic experience, rather than an expression of a child\u2019s imagination.\nHelen\u2019s first four and a half to five years of life included chronic and extreme neglect and\nabuse, so we should assume that her play will include some traumatic re-enactments.\nThese behaviours may or may not have symbolic relevance to the current context in\npsychotherapy, despite appearing to do so.\nCharacteristics of traumatic re-enactment in abused children\u2019s play\nTrauma re-enactment play has been documented in a detailed account of work with a\nfour-and-a-half-year-old, adopted girl who, as an 11-month-old infant, had been in a\nroom when a letter bomb went off, killing her mother (Gaensbauer et al., 1995). Given\nher age, it was assumed the infant would have no memory of the event, and the\ncircumstances of her mother\u2019s death were never discussed in the adoptive home. In the\n248 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\ntherapy room the child had access to typical small toys including an ambulance, police\nand medical dolls, parent dolls and a baby doll. In the session, the child\u2019s self-directed\nactivity took the form of a specific, detailed and factually exact doll play that reproduced\ndetails of the event that could never have been told to her, or discussed in front of her.\nIn this way, rather than being used for imaginative play, the toys were used to re-present\nher unconscious, non-verbal, procedural knowledge of what she had witnessed and\nexperienced on the day, despite the fact that she had no conscious knowledge of the\nevent.\nOften the traumatic, experienced-based origin of such behaviours is unrecognised by\nthe individuals producing them. However, there seems to be an intense need to create\nan exact scenario, such that comments from others suggesting changes in the process go\nunheeded, or are rejected. Such play episodes may be brief, but seem \u2018pre-programmed\u2019\nrather than spontaneous, and may be repeated, exactly, over many therapy sessions.\nOlder children and adults may attempt to create an acceptable narrative to explain their\nrepetitive play enactments: A child who had had her mouth taped during abuse\nrepeatedly taped shut the mouths of the dolls in the therapy room. Her comments\nincluded: \u2018He\u2019s too noisy,\u2019 \u2018She talks too much,\u2019 \u2018She\u2019d better keep quiet.\u2019 These\nstatements may actually have been part of her experience, but I felt she also might have\nbeen adding words to help make sense of the play.\nConsidering the clinical case material\nIn Helen\u2019s first session after the Christmas break she created a play scenario where she\n(a boy tiger) was joined by two female animals in a bed. She introduced the two\n\u2018girlfriends,\u2019 lay between them, then asked the \u2018mother\u2019 (therapist) to photograph them.\nThe therapist commented on Helen\u2019s \u2018feeling special\u2019, and likened a photo to a kind of\nmemory, suggesting that Helen wanted a picture in her mind of herself being \u2018loved and\nwanted by two girlfriends\u2019. These interpretations are then linked to the child\u2019s\nexperience of having had two therapists, and hoping to be made to feel special by both.\nThis symbolic interpretation of the play seems appropriate, if we assume that Helen\u2019s\nplay was an unconscious communication to the therapist of her wishes and anxieties\nregarding their growing relationship.\nHowever, because the play seemed to be the repetition of a set piece, I felt\nHelen \u2013 whose early years were \u2018rife with abuse and neglect\u2019 \u2013 might, instead, have\nbeen procedurally enacting the experience of co-sleeping and being filmed in sexual\nactivity with others. Sadly, the filming of child sexual abuse is not uncommon in the\nhistories of children like Helen. If, in fact, it were the case that Helen was\nunconsciously recreating part of her traumatic history, the therapist\u2019s interpretation\nof the child\u2019s feelings as being special and loved, based on a totally different\nunderstanding of the child\u2019s play, might unintentionally have replicated an\nexperience for Helen of being told that she wanted and liked the abuse. This is\nalso a common perpetrator practice.\nFollowing her therapist\u2019s comments, Helen physically altered the play, strengthening\nmy belief that she was enacting experience, rather than communicating unconscious\nfantasies. Changing her position, she now \u2018lay the other way round\u2019. She then created a\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 249\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\ngap in the middle of the bed, \u2018falling\u2019 through \u2018in a controlled way\u2019. She was unhurt, and\nseemed to be asleep. At the suggestion that her \u2018nice dream\u2019 represented a peaceful time\nduring the gap in therapy, the dream suddenly became a nightmare, and Helen writhed\naround. Procedurally, unconsciously, I believe, because she clearly likes and trusts this\ntherapist, Helen seemed to be trying to reverse the words being spoken about her\nbehaviour.\nIn another example, soon afterwards, Helen asked her therapist to help her find,\nremove and kill the \u2018bugs\u2019 that get into her hair; perhaps they caused her nightmares.\nWhile this could be interpreted in various ways, I found myself thinking procedurally\nagain, realising that this kind of primate grooming might, sadly, have literally been an\nattachment experience for a child who was raised with nine siblings in an extremely\nneglectful environment, where she was often \u2018unclothed and unfed\u2019. In such a situation,\nas the therapist, I would assess my countertransference response to the play. If I was aware\nof feelings linked to intense fear or disgust, in particular, I would attempt to address the\nplay as though it were a real experience first, rather than interpreting the bugs in her hair\nanalytically. I would make this choice because I believe I would be holding projected\naffect from the child at that point, and survival-related affects (terror, rage, disgust) often\naccompany traumatic re-enactments, but rarely accompany imaginative play.\nRather than talking about bug-like things, I might say, \u2018Friends can take bugs out\nof each other\u2019s hair\u2019 (hoping to foster the idea of a mutually supportive attachment).\nOr, \u2018It\u2019s hard not to be afraid to go to sleep if there are bugs that can crawl on you\u2019\n(hoping to \u2018normalise\u2019 her fear of real bugs crawling over her, before addressing the\n\u2018nasty bugs\u2019 in her mind, that might also be there). If Helen responded, as have some\nof my patients, she might suddenly tell me directly about where she sleeps, under\nwhat conditions, or which sibling used to check her hair for her. Or, instead, she\nmight simply continue with the play. In either case, I know that when the material\ncomes up again, there will be an opportunity for more analytic interpretations, when\nthe child is less likely to be involved in a non-conscious enactment, and more able to\nthink about words.\nOverwhelming trauma: Hyper-vigilance and dissociation (\u2018sleeping\u2019 and\n\u2018flying\u2019)\nThe brain\u2019s response to overwhelming trauma includes not only the capacity to be\nhyper-vigilant to the environment (Helen is described as an \u2018observant girl with an\nexcellent memory\u2019), but also the capacity to dissociate from all incoming sensory data.\nAbused children\u2019s responses to intense fear, the hyper-vigilance of the adrenalin-based\nfight or flight survival response, can be quickly replaced by a frozen or dissociative state,\nas if \u2018feeling nothing\u2019 will enhance the chance of survival in the immediate environment\n(Music, 2006; Perry et al., 1995). In a dissociative state, an individual can endure\nintense pain or abuse and not have a conscious memory of the experience. Selma\nFraiberg (1994) describes an infant\u2019s sudden falling asleep as a dissociative response to\ninterpersonal distress with the mother. Severely injured accident victims sometimes\nreport \u2018out of body\u2019 experiences where they see their injured body at the scene and the\nactions of paramedics etc. from a viewpoint above the crash site (Scaer, 2001).\n250 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nI wondered whether Helen was enacting the experience of dissociating during\nabuse when she \u2018fell down and fell asleep\u2019 after reversing her position between two\nfemales. She later morphed to become a bird that could fly as well as create a safe\nnest for eight eggs. Here, I was struck by the number of eggs Helen created to\nprotect, as eight is the number of children in her family who were still alive when\nshe went into foster care. After the Christmas holidays, could she have been having\nmemories of her family of origin, and worries about where they all were, and how\nthey were faring?\nHelen told her therapist that only girls can fly, ironically reminding me of recent\nresearch linking more rapid activation of the freeze response to a greater amount of\nestrogen in the bloodstream (Jasnow et al., 2006). In my professional experience, it is\nnot uncommon for sexually abused female patients (of any age), when describing their\nabuse experience, to report dissociative episodes using such phrases as \u2018floating above the\nscene\u2019, \u2018flying above it all\u2019 or \u2018suddenly being on the ceiling, watching and feeling sorry\nfor a child being hurt, below\u2019. With Helen, I might have asked how one learns to\nbecome a bird and fly, knowing that children enduring chronic, inescapable abuse often\nlearn to roll their eyes up and back under their eyelids, as this can physiologically trigger\na dissociative state.\nHelen\u2019s play after the Easter break concerned me. We read that Helen lay on her back\n(having been \u2018stroked\u2019) having her tummy \u2018licked\u2019, while she made happy dolphin\nsounds and wiggled her legs. A known strategy used by sexual perpetrators who seduce\nyoung children into sexual play is to give animal names to body parts \u2013 fish, dolphin,\nmouse \u2013 and to encourage the child to stroke the \u2018animal\u2019 (genital) or be stroked.\nHelen\u2019s behaviour may have been an enactment of such an experience. She then, again,\n\u2018flew\u2019, and invited her therapist to \u2018ride\u2019 on her back. I want to re-emphasise that I do\nrealise such descriptions and behaviours can, in some cases, be a product of the child\u2019s\nimagination, revealing unconscious wishes or anxieties. However, I believe, given this\nchild\u2019s early history of chronic abuse and neglect, that the therapeutic process will be\nenriched by the therapist holding in mind, along with other psychoanalytic\nconceptualisations of the process, the possibility that, at times, Helen\u2019s play may\nreflect \u2018procedurally authentic\u2019 abuse experiences.\nHelen\u2019s comment, in leaving, that \u2018things have to change in September,\u2019 seemed to\nme to be an attempt to control what she felt was looming on the horizon: an abrupt,\ntraumatic loss of an attachment figure. What is simultaneously hopeful is that she was\ngenuinely engaged in developing a trusting relationship with her therapist,\n\u2018procedurally\u2019\/implicitly letting us know that she values others, despite anticipating\nwhat seems be an inevitable rupture. When her relationship with this therapist does end,\nI feel certain that she will have a new experience, separating with sadness and anger,\nperhaps, but with support.\n1244 Pine Street\nBoulder\nColorado 80304\nUSA\ne-mail: msmoore@mac.com\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 251\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nReferences\nBOWLBY, J.

In this material I thought there were many areas worth\nattention. It is significant that the contributor has chosen to present two sessions,\nseparate in time, each one following a holiday break. From this we have our attention\ndrawn immediately to issues arising from breaks in therapy, themes of loss and\nseparation. Helen is a child who has already suffered losses: the loss of her original birth\nfamily, and losses associated with her multiple moves and that of her first therapist.\nWhat of her ways of relating, her dramatic, yet unconnected, presentation, can we\nunderstand as being to do with her history of deprivation and change? How much of it\ncan we view as resurrected by the experience of the holiday breaks she has just endured?\nI find myself concerned about how I can do justice to all these complexities, which may\nwell reflect the therapist\u2019s concerns about how much use she can be to a child who has\nsuffered such trauma.\n252 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nWith any child in any psychoanalytically informed therapy we can expect a holiday\nbreak to impact significantly on the child\u2019s inner picture of the therapist and the\ntherapeutic relationship, and Helen\u2019s material certainly shows many of the themes we\nmight anticipate. In my experience we can sometimes be poised to deal with all these\nthings in the first session back from the holidays, but unfortunately often fail to look out\nfor the impact of the holidays in subsequent sessions, as if, somehow, having said it once\nwill have been sufficient to deal with it. Awareness of the impact of the break needs to\nbe part of the on-going work.\nIn the opening sentence of the background material, the clinician introduces us\nstarkly to the extremely difficult circumstances of Helen\u2019s early life. We also learn that\nfor the first six months of her time in the care system she had a number of short-term\nplacements. How many placements precisely, we are not told, but we can wonder about\nwhat this disrupted time meant to Helen: how did she understand the loss of her\nparents, however neglectful, and at least two of her siblings? I assume from the\ninformation given that she was then placed without her siblings in her current family.\nAgain, we can only speculate about what this might have meant to her, but the work of\nDebbie Hindle (2000, 2007), who has looked into sibling placements, might help us to\nthink about the impact of those losses, while writings by other child psychotherapists\nsuch as Margaret Hunter-Smallbone (2001, 2007), Jenny Kenrick (2006) and Monica\nLanyado (2004), who all examine the experiences and needs of looked-after and adopted\nchildren and their families, can usefully extend our thinking about all these painful\nissues.\nThe other significant thing that we are told is that Helen had 18 months of intensive\npsychotherapy with a clinician, later referred to as Elsa, who left before Helen began\nwork with the author. We must wonder, especially in the light of her early experiences,\nwhat this meant to her. It is challenging to take over a therapy under any circumstances.\nHow much more difficult might it be with a child who may have had little opportunity\nto develop a sense of trust in the adults around her? Many looked-after children\nhabitually have a glib, surface attachment to those who look after them, often seeming\nto trust and care for the new person very quickly, but through experience we learn that\nthis \u2018positive regard\u2019 is superficial and is quickly transferred to the next, and the next,\ncarer. I wonder about the nature of Helen\u2019s contact with the author. It may be that, at\nthe time of the first session given, Helen had an attachment to the setting (we are told of\nher preoccupation with the room etc.) more than to the therapist. Helen\u2019s history of loss\nmay have influenced the way that she appears to try so hard in her sessions \u2013 the author\nrefers to how highly dramatic they are.\nLooking closely at the sessions, what immediately strikes me is that Helen was\nprevented from coming to the first session back because the \u2018taxi didn\u2019t arrive\u2019. How\nhard it is to be reliant on others who may then let you down \u2013 an all-too-familiar\nexperience for Helen. She regained her sense of agency by being the one to decide when\nto abandon the chat in the waiting room and run to the therapy room. Once there, with\nthe therapist\u2019s help, she tried to get some sense that actions have a chain of cause and\neffect, understanding that Sandra hurt her because of how Sandra perceived her playing\nwith her friends. The idea of possibly misunderstanding and misattributing malice as the\ncause of someone else\u2019s behaviour is also contained in this statement. I wonder if Helen\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 253\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nwas struggling with questioning herself: from her perspective, what on earth was the\ntherapist doing, inflicting pain on Helen through the holiday break? The therapist took\nup the statement that Elsa thought that Helen was \u2018strong\u2019 in terms of Helen\u2019s belief\nthat the relationship can remain intact despite the breaks. I am less clear that this is what\n\u2018strong\u2019 means. I think Helen may have offered it as a comment to please her therapist,\nbut might also have had in mind her capacity to withstand and endure the pain she\nperceives the therapist as inflicting.\nThe therapist\u2019s preference for emphasising the positive is seen again in the next\nparagraph where we have the play about rejection, being one of two and then being\nloved and wanted by two. I think this material certainly contains the aspect the author\npicks up, of being cared for by two therapists. Yet this interpretation then missed the\nopportunity to address Helen\u2019s jealous feelings about the holiday. However, as our\npatients so often do when we fail at first to understand them fully, Helen then displayed\nmore graphically the issues with which she is grappling. Moving on from the therapist\u2019s\nsuggestion that she was having a \u2018nice dream\u2019 and had \u2018managed the holiday gap\npeacefully\u2019, she writhed and said she was having a \u2018bad dream\u2019, and, as emerged in her\nsubsequent play and the therapist\u2019s responses to it, she seemed to be preoccupied with\nall the bugs, frogs, eggs \u2013 small children \u2013 to whom, in her fantasy, the therapist had\nbeen attentive in the break. From her \u2018desperate\u2019 play with its manic quality we get a\nsense of the magnitude of Helen\u2019s task: does she have to be the one to keep the eight\neggs safe (she is one of eight live siblings), feeling that she has to be forever vigilant and\nactive? Rather than talking of Helen \u2018managing the gap\u2019 it might have been more useful\nto ask: at what cost did she apparently manage the gap? Helen showed vividly that she\nhas had to resort to all kinds of defences, some of them leaving her in a very fragmented\nstate. Under the impact of the break the therapist in her mind changes, becomes\nsomeone who cannot help her through thinking \u2013 instead they can \u2018fly\u2019.\nThe next time we hear about Helen is a few months later, when the work was better\nestablished, but again it was after a holiday break when we might anticipate some\nshaking of her trust in the therapist. It is interesting to note the different way in which\nboth the patient and the therapist now tackled the holiday material. Helen was clearer\nabout how hard the break had been for her, managing not to revert to manic defences\nfor most of the session, and the therapist was better able to be direct about the\nrelationship between them. In the puppy play the therapist was not allowed to help or\ngo near Helen or she would \u2018scratch\u2019. This warning that Helen may have hurt the\ntherapist may have reflected Helen\u2019s belief that the therapist had deliberately hurt her by\nthe break. The therapist was alert to the holiday implications of this and of the keys \u2013\nalthough the significance of the keys as enabling Helen to get into the (therapy) home\nwithout an adult, and through the \u2018back door\u2019 whenever she wanted, could have been\nbrought out more. The poignancy of Helen wanting to enact being the therapist\u2019s\ndaughter, with a mother who can read in her \u2018eyes why she was crying\u2019, is palpable.\nHowever, not surprisingly, since \u2018Human kind cannot bear very much reality\u2019 (Eliot,\n1936), towards the end of the session Helen could not stay with her \u2018little\u2019 vulnerable\nself: she had to be admired. The therapist was no longer to play the mother; now she\nhad to be the boyfriend. Something sexual then came into the session; perhaps it had\nbeen indicated already by the material with the keys, directing our attention to the\n254 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n10\n:2\n4 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nproblems of getting into forbidden places and the issues of what you can and cannot\ntouch. The idea of the therapist riding on the back of the dolphin Helen, and the\ndescription of the licking and wriggling, sounded disturbingly masturbatory in fantasy,\neven if not in actuality. We are accustomed to children putting their sexuality to use in\nthe service of manic flight and avoidance. Children also often symbolically raise the\nquestion of what they would have to do to make the therapist willing to stay with them,\nan area of concern already indicated in Helen\u2019s need to please and entertain. In\nparticular, if they have an idea of a perverse adult because they themselves have suffered\nsexual abuse, children may offer themselves to the therapist in a way they believe will be\nseductive and appealing, although we are not in fact told this about Helen, despite her\nhistory of severe neglect.\nIt is not clear why Helen said she would not be at her Thursday session \u2013 of course\nthere may have been some external arrangement that we do not know about, but it is\nalso possible that she wished to take away something from the therapist as she felt her\nsessions were taken from her in the holidays. Similarly, her comment that \u2018things have\nto change in September\u2019 is tantalising \u2013 perhaps Helen was already anticipating the long\nsummer break and was warning the therapist that at this time she did not believe that\nshe could cope with yet another heartbreaking separation. We have to trust that by the\ntime it came she had greater internal resources in place with which to bear it.\nWe know that the level of deprivation that Helen suffered as an infant and young\nchild have left indelible scars. Unlike many children in similar circumstances, at least\nnow she is placed in a stable and supportive family. Helen seems indeed a \u2018strong\u2019 girl,\nbut she has much to contend with, although undoubtedly thoughtful and sensitive\ntherapeutic work will help.\nPortman Clinic, Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust\n8 Fitzjohns Avenue\nLondon NW3 5NA\nUK\ne-mail: janinesternberg@hotmail.com\nReferences\nELIOT, T.S.
