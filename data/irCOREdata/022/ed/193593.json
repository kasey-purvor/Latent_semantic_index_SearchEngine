Haemophilus\ninfluenzae encodes a phase variable homolog of\nType III R-M systems. Sequence analysis of this\nsystem in 22 non-typeable H.influenzae isolates\nrevealed a hypervariable region in the central\nportion of the mod gene whereas the res gene was\nconserved. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis indic-\nated that most sites outside this hypervariable\nregion experienced strong negative selection but\nevidence of positive selection for a few sites in\nadjacent regions. A phylogenetic analysis of 61\nType III mod genes revealed clustering of these\nH.influenzae mod alleles with mod genes from\npathogenic Neisseriae and, based on sequence\nanalysis, horizontal transfer of the mod\u2013res com-\nplex between these species. Neisserial mod alleles\nalso contained a hypervariable region and all mod\nalleles exhibited variability in the repeat tract. We\npropose that this hypervariable region encodes the\ntarget recognition domain (TRD) of the Mod protein\nand that variability results in alterations to the\nrecognition sequence of this R-M system.\nWe argue that the high allelic diversity and phase\nvariable nature of this R-M system have arisen due\nto selective pressures exerted by diversity in\nbacteriophage populations but also have implica-\ntions for other fitness attributes of these bacterial\nspecies.\nINTRODUCTION\nRestriction-modification (R-M) systems, ubiquitous in eubac-\nteria and archaea, are thought to protect organisms from inva-\nsion by foreign DNA. Phase variation (PV), or reversible,\nhigh frequency changes in gene expression, is a feature of\nmany R-M systems and phase variable R-M systems are\nfound in a variety of species including Helicobacter pylori,\nMycoplasma pulmonis, Pasteurella hemolytica, Neisseria\nmeningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae (1\u20135). Surprisingly,\ninformation on these phase variable R-M systems is limited\neven though phase variable expression of DNA modification\nor restriction is likely to have important implications for the\nevolutionary fitness of many bacterial species.\nMost R-M systems comprise a DNA methyltransferase\n(MTase) and a restriction endonuclease. The MTase enables\nrecognition of \u2018self\u2019 DNA by methylation of specific nucle-\notides within particular DNA sequences whereas the endo-\nnuclease enzymatically cleaves \u2018foreign\u2019 unmodified DNA\n(e.g. the genome of an invading bacteriophage). R-M systems\nare classified into three major groups\u2014Types I, II and III\u2014\nand one minor group\u2014Type IV (6). Type I systems are\nencoded by three genes, hsdM, hsdS and hsdR, whose\nproducts form two multi-subunit enzymes; a DNA MTase\ncomposed of HsdM and HsdS sub-units; and an endonuclease\ncomposed of HsdM, HsdS and HsdR sub-units (7). Type II\nsystems, of which there are more than 3500 (6), consist of\ntwo genes, M and R, whose products are an MTase and\nan endonuclease (8). Type III systems are comprised of\ntwo genes, mod and res, whose products form two multi-\nsubunit enzymes: a MTase composed only of Mod sub-\nunits; and an endonuclease composed of both Mod and Res\nsub-units (9).\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed at: Molecular Bacteriology and Immunology Group, Institute for Infection, Immunity and Inflammation,\nSchool of Molecular Medical Sciences, University of Nottingham, Queens Medical Centre, NG7 2UH, Nottingham.

These motifs form a sub-domain of the active\nsite and the binding domain for the methylation substrate\nS-adenosyl-L-methionine. Recent observations of a common\nstructural topology known as an \u2018MTase fold\u2019 suggests that\nthe MTase\u2019s of R-M systems may have evolved from other\nRosmann-fold proteins (11). The MTases of Type I and III\nR-M systems have a gamma or beta-organization of the\nconserved motifs and form distinct clusters in phylogenetic\nanalyses incorporating MTases of Types I, II and III (12).\nR-M systems exhibit extensive diversity in their DNA\nsequence recognition specificities. In Type II R-M systems,\nthis specificity is conferred by an autonomous target recogni-\ntion domain (TRD), which is present in both the MTase and\nthe endonuclease enzymes enabling independent binding of\neach enzyme to the recognition site (11). In Type I and III\nR-M systems binding specificity is conferred by the HsdS\nand Mod sub-units, respectively. Strikingly, hsdS genes\nexhibit high levels of divergence within individual species\nand can undergo recombinatorial re-assortment of the two\nDNA-binding domains resulting in enzymes with altered\nrecognition sites (7,13). The TRDs of Type II systems also\nexhibit significant diversity but TRDs for Type III MTases\nhave not been characterized.\nVarious hypotheses have been advanced for the evolution\nof R-M systems in general and phase variable R-M systems\nin particular. The ubiquity of Type II R-M systems is often\nascribed to either a role in defence against bacteriophage\ninfection or to their exhibition of selfish characteristics\n(14,15). In support of the latter theory, inactivation of the\nMTase subunit is lethal due to restriction of the genome by\nthe endonuclease. In contrast, inactivation of the MTase\ngenes of Type I systems is not lethal due in part to preferen-\ntial degradation of the endonuclease by the protease ClpXP,\nsuch that restriction activity is lost prior to methylation\nactivity (7,15). Although, the specific mechanisms for control\nof Type III restriction endonucleases are unknown, the obser-\nvation that many Type III R-M systems, as well as numerous\nType I but not Type II R-Ms, are subject to PV (16) indicates\nthat loss of expression of a Type III R-M is not lethal. As\nnoted by Dybvig and co-workers for a phase variable\nType I R-M systems (13), an ability to phase vary is not con-\nsistent with the concept of \u2018selfish elements\u2019. Another\nexplanation for the evolution of phase variable R-M systems\nis that, there is fitness benefits associated with the temporary\nalleviation of the barrier imposed by these systems to the\nacquisition of foreign, and potentially beneficial, DNA\nmolecules in naturally transformable species, such as H.pyl-\nori (17\u201319). Alternatively it has been proposed that these sys-\ntems influence the expression or PV rates of other genes\npermitting adaptation to changes in environmental conditions\nby altering expression of unlinked genes (20,21).\nH.influenzae is an obligate commensal of the upper\nrespiratory tract of humans whose genome contains multiple\nphase variable genes (22). Two of the phase variable genes,\nalso termed contingency loci (23), of H.influenzae strain Rd\nencode sub-units of known or putative R-M systems. One\nof these loci encodes HindI, a Type I R-M system (24,25).\nThe hsdM gene of this system contains a pentanucleotide\nrepeat tract (50-GAGAC) whose numbers vary between\nstrains and during persistence of strains in cystic fibrosis\npatients (26). Alterations in repeat number mediate phase\nvariable resistance to infection with HP1c1, a H.influenzae\nbacteriophage (24). The second locus contains a mod\n(HI1056) and a res (HI1055) gene with homology to Type\nIII R-M systems (1). Type III R-M enzymes, HinfI and\nHineI, were purified from H.influenzae strains Rf and Re,\nrespectively, and shown to methylate adenine in the sequence\n50-GCAAT (27\u201329). Although the genes encoding these\nsystems were not identified, there is only one Type III R-M\nsystem present in the two published H.influenzae genome\nsequences (see www.tigr.org) suggesting that HinfI and\nHineI are encoded by alleles of HI1056 and HI1055. A\n50-AGTC repeat tract present in mod mediates high frequency\nPV from this locus (1). Recently, PV of the mod gene of\nH.influenzae strain Rd was found to alter the expression of\na number of unlinked genes, including an outer membrane\nprotein and heat shock proteins, suggesting that this locus\nconstituted a \u2018phasevarion\u2019, i.e. a stochastically expressed\ntranscriptional regulon, whose expression generates fitness\nbenefits in specific environments (20).\nDespite a wide distribution, few phase variable R-M\nsystems have been studied in detail. The aim of this study\nwas to investigate the molecular evolution of a phase\nvariable Type III R-M system of H.influenzae, which has\nbeen implicated as having a major influence on the fitness\nof this species. Sequence analysis of the mod and res genes\nof this R-M system from a number of isolates was conducted\nand a hypervariable region was observed in the central por-\ntion of mod. A likelihood based analysis of evolutionary\nselection pressures revealed the effect of diversifying selec-\ntion pressure on this gene. Additionally, statistical tests of\nrecombination, phylogenetic analyses and visual comparisons\nwere employed to determine the extent of horizontal genetic\nexchange of mod sequences. A laterally-transferred homolog\nof this system in the pathogenic Neisseriae was also observed\nsuggesting the existence of a common gene pool. Finally we\nspeculate on the implications of our findings for the evolution\nof novel R-M specificities and their exchange among bac-\nterial species with differing pathogenicities and for the pro-\nposed biological roles of phase variable R-M systems.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrains\nNon-typeable H.influenzae (NTHi) isolates were supplied by\nJ. Eskola and the Finnish Otitis Media Study Group. These\nisolates were collected from children with otitis media. Iso-\nlates were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) supplemented\nwith either haemin (10 mg\/ml) or NAD (2 mg\/ml) for liquid\nmedia or Levinthal supplement (10%) for solid media.\nAmplification and sequencing of R-M locus\nOligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification and sequen-\ncing of the R-M genes were initially designed using the strain\nRd genome sequence. Subsequently, isolate specific primers\nwere designed using the DNA sequences derived for an\nisolate. Oligonucleotide primer sequences are provided in\nSupplementary Table 1.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 14 4047\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on Septem\nber 15, 2015\nhttp:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nMultiple over-lapping PCR fragments were generated for\neach isolate and these fragments were used in DNA sequen-\ncing reactions. The complete mod and res gene sequences\nand the partial mod gene sequences presented in Supplement-\nary Figure 1 were generated from two or more DNA sequence\nreactions covering both DNA strands. The partial mod\nsequences of isolates 981, 477, 1268, 1200, 1231, 1232,\n1158, 1159, 486, 1209, 375, 1247, 1180, 1181 and 1292 that\nextended into the hypervariable region (and presented in Sup-\nplementary Figure 2) were derived from only one DNA strand.\nDNA sequencing reactions were performed using the ABI\nPRISM BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-\nElmer) and electrophoresed on 4.25% gels using an ABI\n377 Automated Sequencer. The sequence traces specific for\neach isolate were aligned and edited using the PreGap and\nGap4 programs (Staden).\nGenomic sequences for mod and res from H.influenzae\nstrains Rd, R2846 and R2866 were obtained through\nthe TIGR Microbial database (www.tigr.org) and the NCBI\ndatabases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). These sequences were\naligned with those obtained herein using Pileup (Wisconsin\nPackage Version 10.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison,\nWI). GeneDoc version 2.6.001 (30) (www.psc.ed\/biomed\/\ngenedoc) was employed for further editing and generation\nof figures. Where appropriate the numbers of repeats were\naltered to obtain full-length amino acid sequences.\nSelection tests\nA nucleotide sequence alignment of the semi-conserved\nregions of mod genes from the 22 NTHi isolates and strain\nRd was constructed. The alignment was based on the trans-\nlated amino acid sequences of these regions and was con-\nstructed manually. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny\nof the nucleotide sequences was then generated in the pro-\ngram PAUP* (31) using the GTR model of nucleotide sub-\nstitution, with the value for transition\/transversion rate and\nthe shape parameter of an eight-category gamma distribution\nof rate variation among sites, estimated from the data. The\nevolutionary selection pressure at each codon site was invest-\nigated by ML analysis as described previously (32). The pro-\ngram CODEML, part of the PAML package version 3.0 (33),\nwas employed to compare the likelihoods of a series of six\nmodels of codon substitution (each of which assumed differ-\nent types of selection). The log likelihood values for sets of\nmodels, as appropriate, were compared using the likelihood\nratio test. The significance of the results was tested by Chi-\nsquared analysis, with the number of degrees of freedom\nequal to the difference in the number of parameters between\nmodels. Positive selection was inferred when the log likeli-\nhood of the models allowing for positive selection (models\nM2, M3 and M8) were significantly favoured in comparison\nto those which did not (Models M0, M1 and M7), and when\nthe dN\/dS ratio at individual codon sites in M2, M3 and M8\nwas significantly greater than 1. Full ML parameters are\navailable from the authors upon request.\nPhylogenetic analysis\nNucleotide and amino acid sequences for other Type III R-M\nMTase sequences were obtained from the TIGR Microbial\ndatabase, the NCBI databases or from REBASE (rebase.\nneb.com). Identification of Type III R-M systems relied on\nannotations provided in the TIGR database and REBASE.\nSequences with out-of-frame numbers of repeats were\nmanually-altered to obtain in-frame numbers of repeats and\nfull-length amino acid sequences. Amino acid sequences\nwere aligned and a number of semi-conserved regions were\nidentified visually. These regions were then aligned separately\nand subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the neighbour\njoining (NJ) algorithm implemented in the program MEGA,\nversion 3 (34). This algorithm clustered sequences together\nby amino acid p-distance and used a pairwise deletion\nmethod to compensate for alignment gaps among sequences.\nAlignments of a sub-group of the MTases (see text) were gen-\nerated using amino acid sequences lacking the repeat tracts\nand variable regions. Phylogenetic trees of these alignments\nwere constructed as for the semi-conserved regions.\nRecombination analysis\nRecombination was investigated in amino acid and nucleo-\ntide sequence alignments using default parameters in the\nprogram GENECONV version 1.81 [S.A.Sawyer (1999)\nGENECONV: a computer package for the statistical detec-\ntion of gene conversion. Distributed by the author, Depart-\nment of Mathematics, Washington University in St. Louis,\navailable at www.math.wustl.edu\/~sawyer\/]. Recombination\nwas inferred when the simulated P-values for global inner\nrecombination fragments were found to be significant\n\u000295%. The significance of global inner fragments was also\ntested by Bonferroni corrected Karlin\u2013Altschul P-values,\na more conservative, but approximate, test of significance.\nNomenclature of mod types\nThe different alleles of mod are referred to in this paper with\nreference to the isolate from which the sequences were\nderived (e.g. 375mod). The gene products were given a refer-\nence related to the sequence of the variable region (i.e. Mod\ntypes) with each name being followed by a number relating\nto the Mod type (e.g. 375mod encodes M.Hin1056ModP-2;\nsee Table 1). In each case, except one, the Mod types were\nidentical at the sequence level. The exception was Mod type 7\nfor which sequences were found in isolates 162 and 486.\nThese sequences were identical within the variable region\n(hence Mod type 7) but differed outside this region and so\nwere designated A and B. The 1056 in each name refers to\ngene HI1056 (Figure 1) in the strain Rd genome sequence,\nwhich encodes the prototype gene for this R-M system.

The mod gene of strain Rd contains a tract of 32\n50-AGTC repeats. Previously, this repeat tract was found to\nexhibit significant diversity in a range of NTHi isolates\n[Table 1, (1)]. In order to investigate the degree of conserva-\ntion of other regions of mod, we performed an extensive\nsequence analysis of the upstream sequences and N-terminal\nregion of this gene in 22 of these NTHi isolates. A sub-set of\nisolates, representative of the diversity detected in this initial\nsurvey, were then selected for generation of full-length mod\nsequences and an in depth molecular genetic analysis.\nTable 1.

The region around the repeat\ntract of mod was amplified from chromosomal DNA using\nspecific primers and the products subjected to direct sequen-\ncing using both PCR primers and internal primers. These\nnucleotide sequences were then compared with those from\nthree genome sequences (strains Rd, R2866 and R2864;\nSupplementary Figure 1). The sequences started within\ngene HI1059 (rnhB) which was conserved with 11 poly-\nmorphic sites in 123 nt (9%; region i in Figure 1). The inter-\ngenic region between this gene and mod also exhibited few\npolymorphic sites (23 sites, 7%; region ii in Figure 1) but\ncontained four small insertions (10, 1, 2 and 3 bp in 7, 5, 2\nand 3 strains, respectively) and one large 109 bp insertion\n(4 strains), emphasising a plasticity that may be expected\nof non-coding regions.

This region had 48 polymorphic sites (part of region\nvi in Figure 1) with 16 of these being in the final 27 nt\n(Supplementary Figure 1). Thirteen of the polymorphic\nsites produced non-synonymous changes. In two isolates,\n1209 and 1233, the DPPY motif was altered to DVPF\n(amino acid positions 236 and 238, Supplementary\nFigure 2). The polymorphic sites at the end of these sequences\nwere used to define Mod types (Table 1). All sequences of each\nMod type were identical apart from those of Mod type 3. In\nthis case a polymorphism 14 nt downstream of the distal ini-\ntiation codon separates these isolates into two groups (477\nand 981 versus 285, 1200 and 1268) whilst a further poly-\nmorphism in the rnhB gene separates isolates 477 and 981.\nNucleotide sequence data was then obtained from one\nDNA strand that extended up to 450 nt further into the central\nportion of the gene. Comparisons indicated significant\nlevels of sequence variability to the extent that the different\nsequences could not be aligned (Supplementary Figure 3).\nA similar level of variability was exhibited by the amino\nacid sequences (data not shown). Notably the nucleotide\nsequences of the variable region were highly conserved for\ndifferent isolates of the same Mod type. The alignments of\nthese sequences indicated that the central portion of mod\nwas hypervariable.\nIn order to establish the extent of this variability, complete\nsequences were obtained for mod from seven strains and\ncompared to those derived from genome sequences. Two\nalleles (from isolates 432 and 1124) of Mod type 2 were\nsequenced and were found to be identical throughout their\nlength with each other and with that of the mod gene from\nthe genome sequence of strain 86-028 (www.tigr.org),\ni.e. M.Hin86orf1217P in REBASE. Two of the genome\nsequences (Rd and R2866) contained unique Mod types\nwhilst the mod sequence of strain R2846 was identical,\nFigure 1.

The N-terminal domain contained 45 (11%; region\niii in Figure 1) and 153 (32%; Regions v and vi in Figure 1)\npolymorphic sites upstream and downstream of the repeat\ntract, respectively. The C-terminal domain (region viii in\nFigure 1) exhibited variation in length, due to different ter-\nmination codons being utilized in some strains, and contained\n115 polymorphic sites (20%). The hypervariable region\nvaried in length from 594 to 750 nt with each sequence\ntype having a variable region of different length and dis-\nplayed extremely limited homology in both the nucleotide\n(data not shown) and amino acid sequences (Figure 2). One\nmotif (EYIXVXXK) that is conserved between Type III\nMTases was found in this region (37) and was partially con-\nserved in all these strains. All other conserved motifs were\nfound in the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein.\nStructural predictions for these Mod proteins indicated that\nthe variable regions were not structurally conserved, thus\nthis region in the strain 1008 Mod protein consists mainly\nof alpha-helices whilst the strain 162 Mod protein consists\nof some alpha-helices and some regions of a strong beta-\nstrand nature (data not shown). This data indicated that the\nMTase activity of these proteins is encoded by the conserved\nregions whilst the large size and structural heterogeneity of\nthe hypervariable region suggested that this region encodes\na major, alterable function of the Mod protein.\nOne possible explanation for hypervariability in the central\nregion of the Mod protein was that this domain mediated\nprotein:protein interactions with a domain of similar variabil-\nity in the Res protein. To examine this theory, complete\nsequences were obtained for res from three isolates and\ncompared to those derived from genome sequences. The\ngenes varied in length from 2771 to 2888 nt and contained\n417 polymorphic sites (15%) (Supplementary Figure 4) of\nwhich 132 were non-synonymous (Supplementary\nFigure 5).

The absence of significant\nvariability in Res indicated that variability in the central\nregion of Mod was not being driven by a requirement for\nthe maintenance of interactions between the sub-units of the\nendonuclease.\nAnalysis of selection in mod genes\nIn order to identify the selection pressures acting on these\ngenes, a ML analysis was performed on the 50 end of the\nH.influenzae mod gene, using the 22 sequences generated\nherein and the strain Rd genome sequence. Analysis of the\n30 end of mod (see below) was not possible due to the\nlower number of sequences covering this region. Six models\nwere employed, three of which (M2, M3 and M8) allowed for\npositive or diversifying selection. Model M2 was signific-\nantly favoured over models M0 and M7 but not M1 (data\nnot shown). Models M3 and M8 were the best supported\nand significantly favoured over the three models not allowing\nfor positive selection (data not shown). Model M3 provided\nthe most sensitive test for positive selection. Under the\nM3 model, 7.80% of sites were found to experience positive\nselection pressure (dN\/dS \u00bc 2.29); 17.36% of sites were\nweakly conserved (dN\/dS \u00bc 0.36); and the remaining 74.84%\nof sites were strongly conserved, under intense negative or\nstabilizing selection pressure (dN\/dS \u00bc 0.0001). Under the\nM8 model, a similar proportion (7.54%) to the M3 model\nwas under positive selection, with a similar dN\/dS ratio\n(dN\/dS \u00bc 2.31). In the M3 model, posterior probabilities\nidentified eight sites under positive selection above the 90%\nlevel (Table 2). The M8 model identified seven of these\nsites as being under positive selection at the 90% level\n(site 105 was not identified under M8). This analysis demon-\nstrated the existence of strong selection for diversification of\nsome regions, and therefore certain functions, of these Mod\nalleles.\nPhylogenetic relationships of H.influenzae mod genes\nOne strategy for determining the functions and selective\npressures acting on this H.influenzae Type III R-M system\nwas to examine the phylogenetic relationships between the\nH.influenzae mod gene sequences and other extant Type III\nMTases. Amino acid sequences of other known and putative\nType III MTases were obtained from genome sequence\ndatabases and aligned with the amino acid sequences of the\nfull-length H.influenzae mod gene sequences. Conserved pro-\ntein sequences were found in the N- and C-termini of these\nproteins surrounding a variable region, which could not be\naligned (data not shown). The conserved sequences in these\nproteins exhibited variable degrees of similarity to the ten\nmotifs described by Malone et al. (10) with motifs I, II\nand IV having the highest degree of conservation in the\nH.influenzae Mod proteins (Figure 2) and a beta-organization\n(III-IV-V-VI-VIII-IX-X-I-II).\nTo facilitate identification of phylogenetic relationships,\nthe alignments were trimmed to contain only the conserved\ndomains. The NJ algorithm was employed to group similar\nsequences together (Figure 3A) but was not a reliable indic-\nator of any deeper phylogenetic structure, as indicated by\npoor bootstrap values on most branches (data not shown).\nThe H.influenzae Mod proteins clustered together in a clade\nthat included sequences from the pathogenic Neisseria,\nLactococcus lactis, M.pulmonis and H.pylori. Notably Mod\nproteins did not cluster by species. Thus M.NmeBorf1261P\nclustered with M.EcoPI rather than with M.NmeBorf1375P\nand the H.influenzae Mod proteins. Similarly H.pylori\nType III Mod proteins were found in three different positions\non the tree.\nThe groupings in this phylogenetic tree permitted a re-\nevaluation of the alignments of the full-length amino acid\nsequences. The NTHi and Neisserial (i.e. M.NmeB1375P,\nM.NmeA1590P and M.NgoorfC707P) Mod proteins have\nan N-terminal region of 202\u2013242 amino acids, which pre-\ncedes the conserved MTase motifs. This region is of variable\nlength in other Mod proteins. Intriguingly, there was a\ndomain within this region with a high degree of similarity\nto the N-termini of four other Type III Mod proteins\n(M.Hpy99orf1296P, M.MpuC orf3980P, M.MpuC orf3960P\nand M.LlaF1) (data not shown). Homology extended over\n\u0002120 amino acids and included a DEI(D\/S) motif. Another\ngroup of 17 Mod proteins from diverse species also exhibited\nsignificant homology to each other in this region [\u000240 amino\nacids, motifs of WXGK(K\/S) and two conserved prolines].\nFinally a conserved domain was present in the N-termini\nof another group of 9 Mod proteins. This group included\nthe M.StyLTI-like Mods, M.EcoPI, M.EcoP15I and the\nM.NmeBorf1261-like Neisserial Mod proteins [\u000239 amino\nacids, motifs (W\/F)(I\/L)GK(S\/D)YA and HNxxENxxS].\nThe conservation of these motifs between species suggests\nthat the N-terminal region encodes a function that is intrinsic\nto a particular group of Type III R-M systems and is not a\nseparate specific function of the bacterial species.\nThe branch with the H.influenzae sequences was then re-\nanalysed using amino acids sequences that lacked only the\nrepeat tract and hypervariable regions (Figure 3B). The\nH.influenzae enzymes clustered together with the Neisserial\nenzymes. A similar cluster of the Mycoplasma pneumoniae\nMod proteins was also formed. Similar trees were obtained\nby both NJ and split decomposition analyses (data not\nshown). Intriguingly M.NmeAorf1590P of N.meningitidis\nserogroup A was most closely related to Mod of H.influenzae\nstrain 285 rather than to the N.meningitidis serogroup B or\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae Mod proteins.\nTable 2.

Alignments of the nucleotide and amino acid\nsequences with the H.influenzae genes indicated significant\nhomology in the regions flanking the repeat tract and within\nthe C-terminus of the protein (data not shown and Figure 2).\nThe hypervariable region was not conserved either between\nthe H.influenzae and Neisserial genes or between the\nNeisserial genes (data not shown) and thus the Neisserial\ngenes defined three further Mod types for this R-M system.\nThe res genes were also conserved between these species\n(data not shown). The Neisserial mod-res genes are inserted\nbetween a conserved hypothetical open reading frame\nand a gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase. The homology\nbetween the Neisserial and Haemophilus DNA sequences\nis limited to the 40 nt upstream of the initiation codon,\nwhich includes the potential Shine\u2013Delgarno and promoter\nelements, and to 10 nt downstream of the res termination\ncodon (Supplementary Figure 6). The Neisserial mod-res\ngenes exhibited G+C contents of 38\u201342% close to the average\nfor H.influenzae genomes (38%) and significantly different\nfrom that of N.meningitidis genomes (52\u201353%), suggesting\nlateral gene transfer of this Type III R-M system from\nH.influenzae to N.meningitidis and N.gonorrhoeae.\nThe horizontal transfer of the mod gene between species\nwas an indication of genetic exchange of mod gene sequences.\nThis phenomenon was examined further by a statistical ana-\nlysis of recombination between the NTHi mod genes. Five\nhighly significant recombination fragments were detected\nusing the program GENECONV (data not shown). One of\nthe recombination fragments (339 bp) was in the intergenic\nregion of mod types 4 and 8. Two of the fragments, 51 and\n89 bp, covered the conserved MTase amino acids of mod\ntypes 1 and 4 or 2 and 6, respectively. Finally, two of the frag-\nments were found as mosaic sequences in isolates 162, 486\nand 1008. Isolates 162 and 486 form mod sequence type 5\nbut isolate 162 has a unique sequence with a number of poly-\nmorphisms in the N-terminal region of mod. Contrastingly,\nisolates 486 and 1008 are identical for most of the intergenic\nregion (i.e. from position 11) and the N-terminal region of\nmod but differ in the variable region (1008 has mod sequence\ntype 6). The last polymorphism between isolates 162 and 486\nis at nucleotide 1047 whilst the first polymorphism between\n486 and 1008 is at nucleotide 1116 (Supplementary Figure\n1). These results suggested that recombination has occurred\nbetween 1047 and 1116 nt in isolate 486 and indicated that\nthe donor DNA was provided by either 162 or 1008 or\nother isolates with similar DNA sequences.\nA statistical analysis of recombination was then performed\non alignments of the full-length nucleotide sequences of the\nH.influenzae and Neisserial mod genes (data not shown).\nA total of 63 highly significant recombination fragments\nwere detected. A total of 14 fragments were found in the\nN.meningitidis mod genes and 11 of these were across spe-\ncies. Notably the N-terminal regions of the M.NmeBorf1375P\nand M.NmeAorf1590P mod genes were identical up to the\nrepeat tract and diverged subsequently, indicating that the\nrepeat tract may have acted as a recombination break-point.\nSubsequent to the repeat tract, nmeAorf1590MP exhibited\nsignificant similarity to the mod gene of H.influenzae isolate\n285 (90 and 88% at the amino acid and nucleotide levels,\nrespectively), such that these genes were more similar\nto each other than to genes from the homologous species.\nEvidence for genetic exchange of mod sequences between\nthese strains was provided by the detection of a recombi-\nnation fragment (75 bp) in the nucleotide sequences of the\nvariable region. This evidence of recombination between\nmod alleles, both within and across species boundaries, pro-\nvides further support for the existence of strong selective\npressures acting on the function(s) of these proteins.\nDISCUSSION\nA detailed picture of the molecular evolution of a phase vari-\nable Type III R-M system from H.influenzae is provided in\nthis report. The data covers the degree of allelic diversity\n(the first of its kind for a Type III R-M system), selection\npressures, extent of horizontal gene transfer and variations\nin the mechanism of PV. Whilst the genes analysed herein\nhave not been shown to encode functional Type III R-M sys-\ntems, these genes are likely to encode a previously character-\nized H.influenzae Type III R-M system (see Introduction).\nThus, these findings are relevant to the identification of the\nfunctional domains of Type III R-M systems and to the\nexploration of the influence of phase variable R-M systems\non the evolutionary fitness of bacterial species.\nA number of motifs characteristic of MTases of R-M\nsystems were observed in the ends of the H.influenzae mod\nsequences and were conserved in the majority of these\nsequences (Supplementary Figure 2 and Figure 2). ML ana-\nlysis indicated that \u000275% of sites encoding the N-terminal\nregion of the Mod protein experience strong negative\n(purifying) selection most likely reflecting a requirement for\nstructural\/functional conservation. These results suggest that\nthese mod alleles encode functional MTases and that there\nis a strong selection for the maintenance of this activity in\nthese Mod proteins. In contrast, the central region of these\nmod sequences exhibited significant diversity, much higher\nthan other regions of this locus, such that sequence alignment\nwas not possible for the different Mod types (Figure 2 and\nSupplementary Figure 3). This diversity, indicative of strong\ndiversifying selection, prevented a statistical analysis of\nselection. However, the ML analysis identified two sites\n(196 and 201 amino acids, see Table 2) in the N-terminal\nregion of Mod that were subject to positive diversifying\nselection. These sites were upstream of the conserved\nDPPY motif and mark the ends of an insertion, such that\ndifferent strains encode one of four possible motifs: FDG-\nFLKGV, SDGFLKGV, FDGTP and SDGTP. It is possible\nthat this region is under selection because it is part of the\nTRD or because modifications in the TRDs require compens-\natory modifications in this region to maintain MTase activity.\nThe hypervariability of the central regions of the mod\nsequences was not matched by a similar level of\ndiversity in the res sequences (Supplementary Figure 4),\nindicating that the maintenance of interactions between the\nMod and Res proteins was not driving diversification\n4056 Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 14\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on Septem\nber 15, 2015\nhttp:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nof mod. The diversity of these sequences was reminiscent of\nthe plasticity observed for the HsdS sub-units of Type I R-M\nsystems, which confer sequence specific DNA recognition\n(7). We speculate, therefore, that this region of mod encodes\na TRD, which is responsible for recognition of specific DNA\nsequences by the Mod protein and is under strong diversify-\ning selection.\nHorizontal transfer of R-M systems is an established phe-\nnomenon (11,12,38). One impact of such transfer events\ncould be alterations to the recognition site of an R-M system.\nThe observation of a mosaic sequence in the mod genes of\nNTHi isolates 162, 486 and 1008 provided a clear example\nof genetic exchange between alleles of this H.influenzae\nR-M system. The break-point for this recombination event\nwas adjacent to the variable region and may, depending on\nthe direction of transfer, have resulted in exchange of an\nentire variable region between two H.influenzae strains and\nhence re-assortment of the putative TRD domains. Another\npotential example of transfer of a variable region was pro-\nvided by analysis of the mod genes of NTHi isolate 285\nand N.meningitidis strain Z2491 (i.e. M.NmeAorf1590P).\nThese phylogenetically-related mod alleles exhibited signific-\nant similarity from the repeat tract to the end of the gene (see\nFigure 3B) and shared a recombination fragment of 75 bp.\nOne interpretation of this data is, that the genetic exchange\noccurred between these two strains (or strains containing\nrelated mod sequences) and involved a large fragment\nwhich then diverged by mutation. This large fragment\nincluded the variable region and hence the putative TRD.\nIntriguingly, similarity between these mod alleles was\nfound at either end of the variable region (43\/44 and 64\/66\nidentical amino acids in regions 350\u2013394 and 523\u2013604,\nrespectively, Figure 2) whilst the intervening sequences\nwere divergent. This arrangement is indicative of a further\nrecombination event within the variable region of one of\nthese mod alleles and may be evidence of transfer of a\nTRD sub-domain encoded within the variable region. The\nhigh nucleotide sequence conservation of these and other\nmod alleles derived from H.influenzae and Neisserial isolates,\nthe conservation of the flanking regions of the mod-res\nlocus (Supplementary Figure 6), and the low G + C% of the\nNeisserial sequences are indicative of recent transfer of this\nType III R-M system from H.influenzae into the Neisserial\nspp. Indeed, it is possible that transfer of these genes or\nfragments of these genes has occurred multiple times. An\nimplication of this transfer and of the hypervariability of\nthe Neisserial mod sequences is that similar selective pres-\nsures are acting on this system in all these species. Confirma-\ntion of the extent of horizontal transfer of mod sequences\nwithin and between these species and of the affects of these\ntransfer events on the functions of this R-M system will\nrequire a combination of further molecular genetic analyses\nand functional studies.\nPV of mod is mediated by a tetranucleotide repeat\ntract (1). As reported previously the repeat tract is absent in\na number of the NTHi strains and of variable length in\nother strains (1). The assignation of Mod types to these\nsequences permits a further evaluation of the variability of\nthe repeat tracts. Nine of the thirteen Mod types are associ-\nated with repeats and in all the types for which multiple\nisolates were identified the repeat tract was of variable length\n(Table 1). Only in Mod type 2 is the same reading frame\nmaintained in all the isolates. These isolates are likely to\nbe ON phase variants as the frame is initiated by the distal\n50-ATG, which is associated with high expression. Seven of\nthe isolates have repeat numbers associated with the proximal\ninitiation codon or no in-frame initiation codon. The level\nof expression from the proximal initiation codon has been\nreported to generate undetectable or low levels of gene\nexpression in lacZ reporter constructs (1,20), thus it is likely\nthat these isolates are OFF phase variants.\nThese observations of significant variability in the repeat\ntract combined with the diversity in the central region of\nmod, especially if the hypothesis of an impact on sequence\nrecognition is accepted; impinge on the possible roles of\nthis phase variable Type III R-M system. One proposal is\nthat the MTases of this R-M system mediate stochastic vari-\nations in expression of a transcriptional regulon as a mechan-\nism for adaptation to environmental fluctuation (20). This\nhypothesis is based on the observation that PV of the mod\ngene of H.influenzae strain Rd (one of the genes analysed\nin this paper) is linked to phase variable expression of other\nnon-phase variable genes and is predicated on the notion that\nthe Mod protein controls expression of specific genes through\nmethylation of promoter elements (20). This phenomenon\ncould only arise with strong negative selection, resulting in\nmaintenance of the recognition sequence of the Mod protein,\nsuch that significant variability in the mod gene would not\nhave been expected. In particular, variations in the mod\nrecognition sequence, as proposed herein, would have pre-\nvented evolution of specific promoters subject to control by\nMod MTase activity. Furthermore, alterations in the putative\nTRD due to horizontal transfer, as described above, would\nunlink mod alleles from their associated promoters. An altern-\native possibility is that this R-M system acts as a barrier to\ngenetic exchange through transformation and that PV permits\ntemporary alleviation of this barrier and occasional acquisi-\ntion of beneficial sequences, as suggested for the R-M sys-\ntems of other bacterial species (17\u201319). In this case, the\nvariability in the putative TRD suggests that there is strong\nselection for sexual isolation of H.influenzae clones, a sug-\ngestion which contrasts with the high rates of recombination\nobserved for many other genes within this same collection\nof H.influenzae isolates (36).\nA third proposal is that this phase variable R-M system has\na role in preventing bacteriophage infections. It has been\nspeculated that the evolution of diversity in bacteriophage\ngenomes provides resistance to R-M systems by altering the\nnumber of recognition sequences and that this diversity acts\nas a selection pressure for evolution of new target recognition\nspecificities in the R-M system (7,39,40). Three possible\nexplanations may then be invoked for evolution of phase\nvariable resistance to bacteriophage infection. First, PV\nmay limit generation of resistant bacteriophages. Selection\nfor expression of an R-M system (i.e. ON variants) is likely\nto weaken as the resistance of the bacteriophage develops\nresulting in an increase in the number of OFF phase variants\nin the bacterial population. Oscillation between replication\nof the phage in these ON and OFF variants may prevent\nevolution of fully resistant phage. Second, methylation of\nsome \u2018self\u2019 recognition sequences may be detrimental for bac-\nterial proliferation, such that PV may permit switching\nNucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 14 4057\n at Leicester U\nniversity Library on Septem\nber 15, 2015\nhttp:\/\/nar.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nbetween a bacteriophage resistant but inferior growth pheno-\ntype and a bacteriophage sensitive but superior growth pheno-\ntype. This latter system would permit deterimental MTase\nrecognition sequences to be carried in the bacterial population\n(i.e. in the OFF state) until infection by a bacteriophage infec-\ntion provides selection for expression of this allele. Third, PV\nmay permit temporary loss of the phage resistance phenotype\nand incorporation of foreign, potentially beneficial DNA by\ntransduction [as proposed by Zaleski et al. (24) for HindI].\nWhilst it is unclear if infrequent acquisition of adaptive pheno-\ntypes by transduction would exert a high enough selection for\nevolution of phase variable R-M systems, this proposal may\nhave important implications for the evolutionary fitness of\nN.meningitidis. An active prophage was recently found associ-\nated with disease causing isolates of this species (41) and it has\nbeen argued that this prophage confers a fitness advantage by\nincreasing transmission of the meningococcus between hosts\n(42). It is highly likely that transfer of this prophage between\nstrains will be subject to control by R-M systems (including\nthe system described herein), such that switching off an\nR-M system by PV would provide an opportunity for men-\ningococci not carrying the prophage to acquire it thereby\nincreasing their fitness.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank Alison Cody and Gaynor Jenkins for help\nwith preparation of genomic DNA and for electrophoretic\nseparation of sequencing reaction products.
