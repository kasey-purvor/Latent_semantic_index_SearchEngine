We also describe a family of subalgebras of the q-Schur algebra, each of\nwhich is spanned by the canonical basis elements it contains.\n0. Introduction\nThe q-Schur algebra, S\nq\n(n, r) was first introduced by Dipper and James in [2].\nDu[4] introduced a canonical basis for this algebra, which is analogous to the bases\nof Kazhdan and Lusztig for Hecke algebras. Du conjectures [7, section 5] that the\nstructure constants with respect to this canonical basis are Laurent polynomials in\nthe indeterminate vB q\"# with coefficients in .. Du remarks that such a result ought\nto have a proof involving intersection cohomology, but that there should also be\nsome algebraic or combinatorial approach to the problem. The main purpose of this\npaper is to prove Du\u2019s conjecture. The methods used are elementary in that they do\nnot explicitly involve methods from intersection cohomology, but we shall require a\ndeep result due to Lusztig, namely the positivity result for Lusztig\u2019s canonical basis\nof the quantized enveloping algebra of type A. Furthermore, the positivity result for\nq-Schur algebras is equivalent to Lusztig\u2019s result in the sense that an elementary\nproof of one would give an elementary proof of the other.\nThe rest of the paper falls into four parts, the first of which is expository.\nIn Section 2, we study a certain class of subalgebras of S\nq\n(n, r), each of which turns\nout to be spanned by the canonical basis elements it contains.\nIn Section 3 we analyse a certain Lusztig\u2013Dyer basis associated with the quantized\nenveloping algebra of type A. This turns out to be connected to the natural basis of\nthe Borel subalgebra S+\nq\n(n, r) of S\nq\n(n, r).\nIn Section 4, we prove the positivity result, first proving it for the Borel\nsubalgebra, and then extending it to the whole algebra.\n1. Du\u2019s canonical basis\nIn this paper, we shall denote the ring of Laurent polynomials :[v, v\u2212\"] by !. We\nshall also be working with a certain !-form of the q-Schur algebra, also denoted by\nS\nq\n(n, r), as no confusion is likely to arise. As always, the indeterminates q and v are\nrelated via q\u00af v#.\n\u008b Research supported by the E.P.S.R.C.\n402 R. M. Green\nThe canonical basis is a free !-basis for S\nq\n(n, r). It first appeared in [4], where it\nwas defined in the following way.\nLet W\u00af3\nr\nbe the symmetric group on r letters, and let S be the set of basic\ntranspositions\n(1, 2), (2, 3),\u2026 , (r\u00ae1, r).\nLet k be a composition of r, namely\nk\u00af (k\n\"\n,\u2026 ,k\nm\n)\nwith k\n\"\n\u00adI\u00adk\nm\n\u00af r and k\ni\n& 0 for all i. Thus k determines naturally a subset I(k)\nof S. We will write Wk for the parabolic subgroup of W associated with this subset,\nand $k,l for the (unique) set of double coset representatives of minimal length\ncorresponding to the double cosets WkcW}Wl. We also write $+k,l for the set of double\ncoset representatives of maximal length.\nWe denote by ( the Hecke algebra over ! corresponding to W. This is a free !-\nmodule with basis \u00b2T\nw\n\u00b4\nw`W\nsatisfying the relations\nT\ns\nT\nw\n\u00af (TswqT\nsw\n\u00ad(q\u00ae1)T\nw\nif F(sw)\u00af F(w)\u00ad1,\notherwise,\nwhere s `S and F(w) denotes the length of w. If D is a subset of W, we write\nT\nD\nB 3\nx`D\nT\nx\n.\nWe write xk for TWk. Following [3], the q-Schur algebra is defined as\nS\nq\n(n, r)BEnd(0 G\nk`K(n,r)\nxk (1.\n(We are regarding xk ( as a right module for ( via right multiplication.) When q\nis replaced by 1, we recover the classical Schur algebra S(n, r) which was described\nin [9].\nFor k,l `K(n, r) and w `$k,l, we define the element u\nw\nk,l\n`S\nq\n(n, r) by\nuwk,l\n(xm h)\u00af dl,m 3\nx`WkwWl\nT\nx\nh,\nwhere dl,m is the Kronecker delta. It was proved in [3] that the set\n\u00b2uwk,l : k,l `K(n, r), w `$k,l\u00b4\nforms a basis of S\nq\n(n, r). We will call this the natural basis of S\nq\n(n, r).\nWe can define the canonical basis from this basis (using the same indexing set) by\nthe formula (given in [4, (2.c)])\nhwkl \u00af v\nF(w!,l) 3\nz`$k,l\na\nz,w\nuzk,l\n,\nwhere w\n!,\nl is the longest element of Wl and az,w is given by\nv\u2212F(w+)P\nz\n+\n,w\n+.\nHere the polynomial P is the usual Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig polynomial, and we have\ndenoted by w+ the longest element in the same Wk\u00aeWl double coset as w.\nPositivity properties for q-Schur algebras 403\nWe also introduce the set M(n, r) of n\u00acn matrices with nonnegative integer\ncoefficients whose sum is r. With each triple (k,w,l) where k,l `K(n, r) and w `W,\none can associate an element of M(n, r) in such a way that the triples indexing the\nnatural basis are in bijection with the set M(n, r). It is important for the purposes of\nSection 2 to understand this correspondence. Let I(n, r) be the set of r-tuples with\ninteger entries from 1 to n inclusive. If m `K(n, r), we write F(m) for the element of\nI(n, r) given by\n(i\n\"\n, i\n#\n,\u2026 , i\nr\n),\nwhere i\n\"\n%I% i\nr\nand s occurs m\ns\ntimes. Given a triple (k,w,l), we define the\ncorresponding matrix A `M(n, r) by stipulating that A\ni,j\nis the multiplicity of the\nordered pair \u00a9i, j\u00aa in the family\n\u00b2\u00a9F(k)\nw(i)\n, F(l)\ni\n\u00aa\u00b4,\nas i ranges from 1 up to r. We will sometimes write h\nA\nfor hwk,l in this case.\n2. Good subalgebras\nFollowing [10, section 2\u00b13], we now define \u2018good\u2019 subalgebras of the q-Schur\nalgebra S\nq\n(n, r). Consider a set G of matrix units of M\nn\nwith the following two\nproperties :\n(1) if e\nij\n`G and e\njk\n`G then e\nik\n`G ;\n(2) if a\" c and b! d, and if e\nab\n`G and e\ncd\n`G, then also e\nad\n`G and e\ncb\n`G.\nNow consider the subset G(n, r) of M(n, r) defined by the condition\nA `G(n, r) iff (A\nij\n1 03 e\nij\n`G).\nDefinition. Let G be a good set of matrix units. We denote by S\nq\n(G) the subspace\nof S\nq\n(n, r) spanned by the set \u00b2h\nA\n: A `G(n, r)\u00b4.\nLemma 2\u00b11. Let G be a good set of matrix units, and let A `G(n, r). Write hwk,l for hA\n(where w is any element of W), and let w\u00ab%w in the (strong) Bruhat order. Let B be\nsuch that h\nB\n\u00af hw\u00abk,l. Then B `G(n, r).\nProof. It was mentioned in [8, lemma 2\u00b12] that w\nB\n%w\nA\nif and only if the sequence\n(w\nA\n(1),\u2026 ,w\nA\n(r)) is obtainable from the sequence (w\nB\n(1),\u2026 ,w\nB\n(r)) by a sequence of\ntranspositions (i, j) where i! j and i occurs to the left of j in (w\nB\n(1),\u2026 ,w\nB\n(r)).\nNow consider an arbitrary ascending sequence such as F(k) on which w\nB\nand w\nA\nact. (The case of the sequence (1, 2,\u2026, r) was done in the last paragraph.) It follows\nby using the above techniques and omitting irrelevant transpositions that if w\nB\n%\nw\nA\nthen the sequence\n(w\nA\n(F(k)\n\"\n),\u2026 ,w\nA\n(F(k)\nr\n))\nis obtainable from the sequence\n(w\nB\n(F(k)\n\"\n),\u2026 ,w\nB\n(F(k)\nr\n))\nby a sequence of transpositions (i, j) where i! j and i occurs to the left of j in\n(w\nB\n(F(k)\n\"\n),\u2026 ,w\nB\n(F(k)\nr\n)).\n404 R. M. Green\nUsing the correspondence between the two forms of the basis, it is now not hard\nto see that the matrix B can be obtained from the matrix A in a sequence\n(A\u00afC\n!\n,C\n\"\n,C\n#\n,\u2026 ,C\nm\n,C\nm+\"\n\u00afB),\nwhere each of the C\ni\nlies in M(n, r) and for each i, C\ni+\"\n\u00aeC\ni\nis a matrix of the form\ne\nab\n\u00ade\ncd\n\u00aee\nad\n\u00aee\ncb\n,\nwhere a! c and b! d. Axiom 2 for a good set of matrix units now shows that all the\nmatrices C\ni\nlie in G(n, r) (because e\nab\nand e\ncd\nmust be elements of G if e\nad\nand e\ncb\nare) ;\nin particular, B does.\nTheorem 2\u00b12. The !-subspace S\nq\n(G) of S\nq\n(n, r) is a subalgebra of S\nq\n(n, r) of\ndimension\n0m\u00adr\u00ae1r 1 ,\nwhere m is the cardinality of G.\nProof. This is reworking of [10, theorem 2\u00b13\u00b13], which says the same thing but\nwhich starts with a different definition of S\nq\n(G). It therefore suffices to prove that the\ntwo definitions are equivalent.\nThe definition of S\nq\n(G) in [10, section 2\u00b13] is a !-module spanned by the natural\nbasis elements \u00b2[A] : A `G(n, r)\u00b4 for the good set G. (The element [A] is a certain power\nof v times the element e\nA\n.) Clearly this has the same dimension as the S\nq\n(G) we have\njust defined, so it is enough to show that if A `G(n, r) then h\nA\nis expressible as a linear\ncombination of the set \u00b2[A\u00ab] : A\u00ab `G(n, r)\u00b4. To prove this, we use Lemma 2\u00b11 and the\ndefinition of the canonical basis.\nBy definition, we know that\nhw+kl \u00af v\nF(w!,l) 3\nz`$k,l\na\nz,w\nuz+k,l\n,\nwhere w\n!,\nl and az,w are as in Section 1. Because Pz+,w+ (and hence az,w) is only nonzero\nif z+%w+, we can apply Lemma 2\u00b11 to this expression and deduce that if the matrix\nindexing hw+k,l is in G(n, r), then so are all the matrices indexing the terms on the other\nside with respect to the natural basis. This proves the desired result.\nRemarks. One can now deduce from the results about Zariski closures in the\nappendix of [4] that good subalgebras have a geometric interpretation in the\napproach of Beilinson, Lusztig and MacPherson[1]. They correspond to certain\nclosed subalgebras of the q-Schur algebra with respect to the Zariski topology (i.e.\nsubalgebras which are unions of closed orbits, since there are only finitely many\norbits) provided that r\" 1. This follows because the ordering % defined in [1] in\nterms of the Zariski closure is essentially the same as the strong Bruhat order.\nIt is also obvious that a positivity property for the canonical basis of any good\nsubalgebra would follow from the positivity property of S\nq\n(n, r).\nIn Section 3 we will require the following result.\nCorollary 2\u00b13. The Borel subalgebra S+\nq\n(n, r) spanned by all upper triangular\nelements [U] is spanned by the canonical basis elements it contains, that is, the ones\ncorresponding to upper triangular matrices.\nPositivity properties for q-Schur algebras 405\nProof. Note that the set \u00b2e\nij\n: i% j\u00b4 is good. For any h\nA\n, it will be true that h\nA\nlies\nin S+\nq\n(n, r) if and only if all the terms in its expression in terms of the natural basis\ndo. We now see from Theorem 2\u00b12 that this will be true if and only if the matrix A\nis upper triangular. The assertion is now clear from dimension considerations.\n3. Lusztig\u2013Dyer bases\nThe aim of Section 3 is to understand explicitly the connection between a certain\nLusztig\u2013Dyer basis of the quantized enveloping algebra U+(sl\nn\n) and the natural basis\nof the q-Schur algebra S\nq\n(n, r). Once this is understood, we can compare Lusztig\u2019s\ncanonical basis for U+(sl\nn\n) with the canonical basis for S\nq\n(n, r). It will turn out that\nthere is a close connection.\nWe then use this connection to deduce positivity properties for the Borel\nsubalgebra S+\nq\n(n, r).\nThe !-subalgebra U+(sl\nn\n) of the quantized enveloping algebra U(sl\nn\n) is generated\nby elements E\n\"\n,\u2026 ,E\nn\u2212\"\nsubject to relations\nE\ni\nE\nj\n\u00afE\nj\nE\ni\nif ri\u00aejr\" 1\nand E#\ni\nE\nj\n\u00ae(v\u00adv\u2212\")E\ni\nE\nj\nE\ni\n\u00adE\nj\nE#\nj\n\u00af 0 if ri\u00aejr\u00af 1.\nThe first aim (which is the hardest part of this section) is to show that a certain\nLusztig\u2013Dyer basis for U+(sl\nn\n) agrees with the basis U+(sl\nn\n) which was studied in [10].\nWe denote by W the symmetric group 3\nr\nregarded as a Coxeter group of type A\nr\u2212\"\n.\nThe generators are the simple transpositions s\np\nB (p,p\u00ad1).\nWe denote by a\ni,j+\"\n(where i% j) the positive root a\ni\n\u00ada\ni+\"\n\u00adI\u00ada\nj\n.\nLet s\ni\"\ns\ni#\nI s\niN\nbe a reduced expression for the longest word w\n!\nof W. Associated to\nthis reduced expression is an ordering on the positive roots : the m-th root in the list\nis\ns\ni\"\nI s\nim\u2212\"\n(a\nim\n),\nwhere the action is the usual action of the Weyl group on the root system and a\nim\nis\nthe i\nm\n-th fundamental root.\nLemma 3\u00b11. The word\n(s\nn\n) (s\nn\u2212\"\ns\nn\n) (s\nn\u2212#\ns\nn\u2212\"\ns\nn\n)I (s\n\"\nI s\nn\n)\nis a reduced expression for the longest element w\n!\nof W. It corresponds to the ordering on\nthe positive roots of sl\nn+\"\ngiven as follows : the root a\ni,j\nappears to the left of the root a\nk,l\nif and only if i\" k or (i\u00af k and j\" l).\nProof. It is well known (see for example [15]) that the given expression is a reduced\nexpression for the longest element of W. The other assertion can be seen by a\nstraightforward induction on n, using the fact that if a,b,a\u00adb are all positive roots,\nthen the root a\u00adb appears between the other two in the order. (This was mentioned\nin [11].)\nDefinition 3\u00b12. The Lusztig\u2013Dyer basis L corresponding to this reduced expression\nof the longest word was given in [14, 42\u00b11\u00b14] and consists of certain elements\nE(c\")a\n\"\nE(c#)a\n#\nIE(cN)a\nN\n,\n406 R. M. Green\nwhere N is the number of roots in the order a\n\"\n,\u2026 ,a\nN\n.

In [12, lemma 2\u00b15], Lusztig proves some identities about certain elements\nE!a\ni,j\n(which are denoted by Ea\ni,j\n, but we shall not do this, since they are not the same\nas our elements Ea\ni,j\n).

The proof in both cases is a straightforward induction on r j\u00aeir.\nProposition 3\u00b19. For all positive roots a\ni,j\nwith 1% i! j%n,\nEa\ni,j\n\u00afEW a\ni,j\n.\nProof. By the remarks following Lemma 3\u00b13, we need only verify the statement of\nthe Proposition for the case v\u00af 1. The proof is by induction on n. The base case of\nn\u00af 2 is obvious.\nNow consider all the roots except the last (n\u00ae1) in the list. We see that a\ni,j\nis such\na root if and only if i\" 1. The definition of the corresponding Ea\ni,j\nis of the form\nTh\ni\"\nITh\nim\u2212\"\n(E\nim\n),\nwhere all the entries i\ns\nappearing are strictly greater than 1. (Note that in our\nreduced expression for w\n!\n, there is only one occurrence of s\n\"\n.)\nNow consider\nE\u00ab\u00afTh\ni\"\u2212\"\nITh\nim\u2212\"\u2212\"\n(E\nim\u2212\"\n).\nThe nature of Lusztig\u2019s action of the braid group shows that this is in fact equal to\nW\u2212(Ea\ni,j\n). However, we see by reference to the case of (n\u00ae1) that E\u00ab\u00afEa\ni\u2212\",j\u2212\"\n. Hence\nEa\ni,j\n\u00afW+(E\u00ab)\u00afW+(Ea\ni\u2212\",j\u2212\"\n).\nWe now use the inductive hypothesis (for the case (n\u00ae1)) and Lemma 3\u00b18 to deduce\nthat\nW+(Ea\ni\u2212\",j\u2212\"\n)\u00afW+(EW a\ni\u2212\",j\u2212\"\n)\u00afEW a\ni,j\nas required.\nWe now turn our attention to the last (n\u00ae1) roots in the list. The longest root is\ndealt with by Lemma 3\u00b15. The last root is dealt with by Lemma 3\u00b16. The other root\nvectors are of the form E\n\",a\nfor 2! a!n.

I\nThe reason for going to so much trouble in checking that the two bases of U+ agree\nis that the Lusztig\u2013Dyer basis that we have been studying is closely related to the\nnatural basis \u00b2[A] : A `M(n, r)\u00b4 of S\nq\n(n, r). In [6], a certain algebra homomorphism\np\nr\n: U(sl\nn\n)US\nq\n(n, r) was introduced. We use this to relate the Lusztig\u2013Dyer basis to\na basis of S+\nq\n(n, r), the Borel subalgebra of S\nq\n(n, r) spanned by all upper triangular\nbasis elements.\nProposition 3\u00b110. Let X be the set of orthogonal idempotents \u00b2[D]\u00b4 of S\nq\n(n, r)\nparametrised by diagonal matrices in M(n, r). Denote by B the Lusztig\u2013Dyer basis of\nU(sl\nn\n), as defined Section 3\u00b12. Then the nonzero elements of the set\n\u00b2[D]\\p\nr\n(b) : [D] `X, b `B\u00b4\n410 R. M. Green\nare precisely the elements\n\u00b2[U] `S\nq\n(n, r) : U is upper triangular\u00b4.\nProof. This follows from [10, propositions 4\u00b11\u00b13, 4\u00b12\u00b11], because we know by\nProposition 3\u00b19 that the two bases are equivalent.\n4. The positivity result\nThe next aim is to use Proposition 3\u00b110 to establish the positivity property for\nS+\nq\n(n, r).\nDefinitions. Following [4], we write uW wk,l for v\nF(w\n+\n)+F(w!,l)uwk,l\n. Note that if uwk,l\ncorrespnds to A `M(n, r), then uW wk,l \u00af [A].\nIn [4, section 3\u00b11], a :-linear involution, \u2212, on S\nq\n(n, r) is described. This sends v to\nv\u2212\" and fixes all hwk,l.\nThe algebra U+ also has a :-linear automorphism, \u2212, sending v to v\u2212\" and fixing all\nthe E\ni\n. (No confusion will arise in the similarity of notation as will be seen shortly.)\nLemma 4\u00b11.\n(a) For all possible k and l, the identity\nh\"k,l\n\u00afuW \"k,l\nholds in S\nq\n(n, r).\n(b) For all 1% i!n, p\nr\n(E\ni\n)\u00afp\nr\n(E\ni\n).\n(c) Let u `U+. Then p\nr\n(u)\u00afp\nr\n(ua ). Thus if u `U satisfies ua \u00afu then p\nr\n(u)\u00afp\nr\n(u).\nProof. The proof of (a) follows from the expression for the h basis in terms of the\nuW basis given in [4, section 3\u00b18], and the fact that if z+% 1+ in the Bruhat order then\nthe distinguished double coset representative of z is 1.\nThe proof of (b) follows using the definition (as in [6]) of p\nr\n(E\ni\n) which is of the form\n3\n\u00a9k,l\u00aa\nuW \"k,l\nfor a certain set of pairs \u00a9k,l\u00aa.\nFor (c), observe that (b) shows it is true for the generators E\ni\n. Because \u2212 is an !-\nsemilinear algebra homomorphism and p\nr\nis an !-linear algebra homomorphism, the\nresult follows.\nDefinitions. We define !+ to be :[v], and !\u2212 to be :[v\u2212\"].\nDenote by , the free !\u2212-module with the Lusztig\u2013Dyer basis L as a basis. There\nis a canonical projection\np, : ,U,}v\u2212\",.\nDenote by ,\u00ab the free !\u2212-module with \u00b2[U] : U is upper triangular\u00b4 as a basis.\nThere is a canonical projection\np,\u00ab : ,\u00abU,\u00ab}v\u2212\",\u00ab.\nFollowing [14, theorem 42\u00b11\u00b110, corollary 42\u00b11\u00b113], we can characterize the\ncanonical basis B of U+(sl\nn\n) by the following two properties.\n(1) For each b `B, ba \u00af b.\n(2) For each b `B, p,(b)\u00afp,(b\u00ab) for exactly one b\u00ab `L.\nPositivity properties for q-Schur algebras 411\nUsing Corollary 2\u00b13 and [4, theorem 3\u00b19], we can characterize the canonical\nbasis B\u00ab of S+\nq\n(n, r) by the properties\n(1\u00ab) for each b `B\u00ab, ba \u00af b ;\n(2\u00ab) for each b `B\u00ab, p,\u00ab(b)\u00afp,\u00ab(b\u00ab) for exactly one b\u00ab\u00af [U] where U is upper\ntriangular.\nProposition 4\u00b12. The nonzero elements\n\u00b2[D]\\p\nr\n(b) : b `B,D diagonal, D `M(n, r)\u00b4\nare precisely the canonical basis elements h\nU\nin S\nq\n(n, r).\nProof. We need to verify properties (1\u00ab) and (2\u00ab) above. To check 1\u00ab, we observe that\n[D]\u00af h\"kk for some k. Hence by Lemma 4\u00b11,\n[D]p\nr\n(b)\u00af [D]\\p\nr\n(b)\n\u00af [D]p\nr\n(ba )\n\u00af [D]p\nr\n(b).\nWe now verify (2\u00ab). Property (2) for Lusztig\u2019s canonical basis implies that, by\nexpressing b `B as a linear combination of b\u00ab, b\u00a7 `L, we can write\n[D]p\nr\n(b)\u00af [D]p\nr\n(b\u00ab)\u00ad 3\nb\u00a71b\u00ab\nc\nb\u00a7\n[D]p\nr\n(b\u00a7),\nwhere [D]\\p\nr\n(b) is as in the statement of the proposition and the coefficients c\nb\u00a7\nlie in\nv\u2212\"!\u2212. Thus by Proposition 3\u00b110,\n[D]p\nr\n(b)3 [D]p\nr\n(b\u00ab) mod,\u00ab}v\u2212\",\u00ab.\nSuppose that [D]p\nr\n(b\u00ab)\u00af 0. Then [D]p\nr\n(b) ` v\u2212\",\u00ab. This means that\n[D]p\nr\n(b)\u00af3 c\nU\nh\nU\n,\nwhere c\nU\n` v\u2212\"!\u2212. (This follows from property 2\u00ab of the canonical basis of S+\nq\n(n, r) ; the\nelements h\nU\nare an !\u2212-basis of ,\u00ab.) Applying \u2212 to this equation shows that c\nU\n\u00af c\nU\nfor all c\nU\n. This forces all the c\nU\nto be zero, and [D]p\nr\n(b)\u00af 0.\nThis gives the correspondence required by (2\u00ab), completing the proof. I\nWe can now give a partial result towards the positivity conjecture.\nCorollary 4\u00b13. The algebra S+\nq\n(n, r) equipped with its canonical basis has the\npositivity property.\nProof. First note that any canonical basis element h\nA\nhas the property that h\nA\n\u00af\nh\nD\nh\nA\nh\nD\u00ab\nfor unique diagonal matrices D and D\u00ab. Also, [D] [D\u00ab]\u00af d\nD,D\u00ab\n[D]. Thus if\n[D]p\nr\n(b\n\"\n) and [D\u00ab]p\nr\n(b\n#\n) are both canonical basis elements (as before), then\n[D]p\nr\n(b\n\"\n) [D\u00ab]p\nr\n(b\n#\n)\u00af (0[D]p\nr\n(b\n\"\nb\n#\n)\nif ([D]p\nr\n(b)) [D\u00ab]\u00af 0,\nif ([D]p\nr\n(b)) [D\u00ab]\u00af [D]p\nr\n(b).\nWe now invoke a deep result of Lusztig, namely the positivity property for\nLusztig\u2019s canonical basis ([14, theorem 14\u00b14\u00b113 (a)]). This shows that\nb\n\"\nb\n#\n\u00af 3\nb\u00ab`B\nc\nb\u00ab\nb\u00ab,\n412 R. M. Green\nwhere c\nb\u00ab\n`.[v, v\u2212\"].

I\nThe final stage of the proof is to extend this partial result to the whole algebra\nS\nq\n(n, r). To do this, we use the following result.\nLemma 4\u00b14 (Du). Let hdkl, h\"l,m (where d `$kl) be canonical basis elements for Sq(n, r).\nSuppose Wm XWl. Then\nhdkl\\h\"lm \u00af hd\nd\u00ab\nkm\nwhere d\u00ab is such that Wk d+Wm \u00afWk d\u00abWm.

For a, b ` \u00b21, 2, 3\u00b4 and n\" 1 we define\nD(n, a, b)\u00af\u00b2A `M(3n, r) : A\ni,j\n1 03 dx : i\u00af x\u00ad(a\u00ae1)n, j\u00af x\u00ad(b\u00ae1)n\u00b4.\nExample. Let a\u00af 1, b\u00af 2. Then a typical element of D(n, a, b) is a matrix\nE\nF\n0\n0\n0\n0\nD\n0\n0\n0\n0\nG\nH\n,\nwhere D is an n\u00acn diagonal matrix and the zero entries represent n\u00acn diagonal\nmatrices with zero entries.\nDefinition. For i, j ` \u00b21, 2, 3\u00b4, we define r\ni,j\n`S\nq\n(3n, r) by\nr\ni,j\n\u00af 3\nD`D(n,i,j)\n[D].\nNote that such a [D] is of the form h\"k,l where Wk \u00afWl.\nLemma 4\u00b15.\n(a) The injective !-linear map i : S\nq\n(n, r)9S\nq\n(3n, r) given by i(h\nA\n)\u00af h\nA\u00ab\nwhere\nA\u00ab\u00af\nE\nF\n0\nA\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nG\nH\nis a monomorphism of !-algebras.\n(b) On im (i), r\n\",\"\nis the multiplicative identity, that is, r\n\",\"\ni(h\nA\n)\u00af i(hA)r\n\",\"\n\u00af i(hA).\n(c) For i, j, k ` \u00b21, 2, 3\u00b4, r\ni,j\nr\nj,k\n\u00afr\ni,k\n.\nProof. Part (a) follows easily from the definition of the canonical basis. For part (b),\nobserve that i(1)\u00afr\n\",\"\n, where 1 is the identity in S\nq\n(n, r). Part (c) is a corollary of\nLemma 4\u00b14. I\nWe are now ready to prove the main result.\nPositivity properties for q-Schur algebras 413\nTheorem 4\u00b16. The structure constants for S\nq\n(n, r) with respect to the canonical basis\nlie in .[v, v\u2212\"].\nProof. Choose h\nA\n, h\nB\n`S\nq\n(n, r). We may assume the product h\nA\nh\nB\nis not zero. We\nexpress the structure constants as\nh\nA\nh\nB\n\u00af 3\nC`M(n, r)\nf\nA,B,C\nh\nC\n.\nHence, by Lemma 4\u00b15 (a),\nr\n\",\"\ni(h\nA\n) i(h\nb\n)r\n\",$\n\u00af 3\nC`M(n,r)\nf\nA,B,C\nr\n\",\"\ni(h\nC\n)r\n\",$\n.\nUsing Lemma 4\u00b15 (b) and (c) we find that\n(r\n\",\"\ni(h\nA\n)r\n\",#\n) (r\n#,\"\ni(h\nB\n)r\n\",$\n)\u00af 3\nC`M(n,r)\nf\nA,B,C\n(r\n\",\"\ni(h\nC\n)r\n\",$\n).\nNote that by Lemma 4\u00b14, all the expressions in parentheses are canonical basis\nelements of S\nq\n(3n, r). More importantly, the matrix indexing the basis element\nr\n\",\"\ni(h\nA\n)r\n\",#\nis of the form\nE\nF\n0\n0\n0\n0\nA\n0\n0\n0\n0\nG\nH\nand the matrix indexing the basis element r\n#,\"\ni(h\nB\n)r\n\",$\nis of the form\nE\nF\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nB\n0\n0\nG\nH\n.\nThe matrices corresponding to the elements r\n\",\"\ni(h\nC\n)r\n\",$\nare of the form\nE\nF\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nC\n0\nG\nH\n.\nThese are all upper triangular canonical basis elements, so lie in S+\nq\n(3n, r). Thus by\nCorollary 4\u00b13, all the f\nA,B,C\nlie in .[v, v\u2212\"].\nCorollary 4\u00b17. The structure constants for S\nq\n(n, r) with respect to the canonical basis\nare naturally interpretable in terms of intersection cohomology.\nProof. The proof of Theorem 4\u00b16 shows that the structure constants are the same\nas certain structure constants in the algebra S+\nq\n(3n, r). The proof of Corollary 4\u00b13\nshows that these are the same as certain structure constants arising from Lusztig\u2019s\ncanonical basis (provided they are not zero). It is known from [14, theorem 14\u00b14\u00b113]\nthat these latter constants have a natural interpretation in the framework of\nperverse sheaves and intersection cohomology.\nAcknowledgement.
