It has been widely used as a biological control agent of aphids\n35 in the Americas and Europe, in greenhouses as well as in outdoor crops (Koch 2003;\n36 Pervez and Omkar 2006). In North America, since its establishment in the 1980s, it has\n37 spread and increased dramatically so that it is now the dominant ladybird species in\n38 much of the USA and Canada (Koch and Galvan 2008). Three categories of hazards\n39 caused by this invasive ladybird are reported (Koch et al. 2006). First, it is considered\n40 as a human nuisance because it aggregates in buildings when seeking overwintering\n41 sites, causing cosmetic damage and, occasionally, biting humans and causing allergic\n42 reactions (McCutcheon and Scott 2001; Huelsman and Kovach 2004; Kovach 2004;\n43 Ray and Pence 2004). Second, H. axyridis has been reported to damage fruit crops in\n44 late summer and to taint wine when harvested and crushed with grapes (Koch et al.\n45 2004; Kovach 2004; Pickering et al. 2005). Finally, due to its predatory and compet-\n46 itive abilities, H. axyridis may have strong negative effects on biodiversity, affecting\n47 many non-target species, including native ladybirds and other aphidophagous insects\n48 but also non-pest aphids or other herbivorous insects (see reviews by Majerus et al.\n49 2006 and Koch and Galvan 2008).\n50 In Europe, H. axyridis has been released in the wild since 1990 (Brown et al. 2008).\n51 Since the first observations of feral populations were reported in 1999 in Germany and in\n52 Belgium in 2001, numbers have increased exponentially and it is now regarded as\n53 established in 12 European countries (Brown et al. 2008). In Belgium, recent surveys\n54 showed that H. axyridis has become by far the most abundant ladybird on broadleaved\n55 trees (Adriaens et al. 2008).\n56 Since the establishment of H. axyridis in North America, this invasive ladybird has been\n57 the target of numerous research programmes, which have been summarised in several\n58 review articles (e.g. Adriaens et al. 2003; Koch 2003; Majerus and Roy 2005; Koch et al.\n59 2006; Pervez and Omkar 2006). None of these reviews, however, cover the currently used\n60 and potential management methods to control H. axyridis.\n61 Several methods are presently implemented or being studied to control the ladybird in\n62 North America. These methods differ according to the three main types of hazards caused\n63 by the beetle (aggregation in buildings, damage to fruits and wine and competition with the\n64 native fauna). Most management methods, proposed so far, concern preventive or curative\n65 control against ladybird aggregation in houses or in vineyards. No method is presently\n66 available to lower population densities in natural environments and to limit the impact of\n67 the ladybird on native species.\nM.

Recommendations to prevent the entrance of beetles in\n73 buildings include: checking for all possible entry sites; sealing windows, cracks and small\n74 holes throughout the house with weather stripping; placing insect screening over windows,\n75 attic, exhaust vents, etc. To remove large aggregates of beetles in buildings, the use of a\n76 broom and dust pan or, better, a vacuum cleaner is recommended (Jones and Boggs 2002;\n77 Baniecki et al. 2004; Potter and Townsend 2005). Jones and Boggs (2002) describe how a\n78 vacuum cleaner can be modified to capture ladybirds and avoid them entering the vacuum\n79 by using a sweeper attachment with a knee-high nylon hose inserted in the end.\n80 Various traps are recommended and commercially available to catch adult beetles in\n81 buildings (Banieki et al. 2004). Black light traps and other light traps can be used for\n82 capturing beetles in dark confined places such as attics. Window traps may be effective\n83 during daytime. Although it has been suggested that these traps could reduce beetle\n84 populations by 50\u201370% (Jones and Boggs 2002; Banieki et al. 2004), thorough testing is\n85 required to ascertain whether they provide a solution for large infestations of H. axyridis\n86 (Jones and Boggs 2002; Potter and Townsend 2005). Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that\n87 light traps could efficiently control ladybirds in outdoor conditions, e.g. in vineyards or\n88 orchards. The efficiency of trapping methods in buildings and open field could be greatly\n89 enhanced by coupling with semiochemicals. There are many examples in the literature of\n90 insects using olfactory communication for dispersal, migration, reproduction, aggregation\n91 and alarm signalling (reviewed in a pest control context by Van Emden and Service 2004).\n92 Over the last 30 years the behavioural manipulation of insects through semiochemical\n93 techniques (for example: push\u2013pull strategies) has been considered for the control of insect\n94 populations, with varying success (Cook et al. 2007). However, our theoretical under-\n95 standing of insect semiochemistry has increased enormously in recent years (reviewed by\n96 Hassanali et al. 2005; Cook et al. 2007; Roy et al. 2008a) and applications exploiting this\n97 knowledge, within pest control strategies, are being developed further. Pheromones have\n98 been used within integrated pest management (IPM) strategies for: monitoring pest pop-\n99 ulations, trapping out pest populations (\u2018\u2018lure and kill\u2019\u2019), confusing pests (saturating a crop\n100 environment with synthetic pheromones to prevent males locating females), deterring\n101 oviposition and manipulating or encouraging natural enemies.\n102 Information on semiochemically-mediated behavioural mechanisms of coccinellids is\n103 limited (Pettersson et al. 2005) but there are sufficient recent studies to suggest that, like\n104 other insects, chemical communication is an important component of ladybird behaviour\n105 (Burns et al. 1998; Hemptinne et al. 2004; Pettersson et al. 2005). The use of autumn\n106 aggregation pheromones for the location of suitable overwintering sites perhaps has the\n107 most significant potential for use in a control strategy. It has been widely speculated that\n108 many species of ladybirds use species-specific aggregation chemicals in preparation for\n109 dormancy (Majerus 1994). Hills (1969) suggested that Adalia bipunctata (L.) (Coleoptera:\n110 Coccinellidae) used pheromonal volatiles from the excretal remains of individuals over-\n111 wintering the previous year. Majerus (1994) demonstrated that A. bipunctata were less\n112 likely to locate sites that had been washed between overwintering events, providing strong\n113 circumstantial evidence of a long lasting, aggregation pheromone. In a more recent study,\n114 Pettersson et al. (2005) demonstrated that Coccinella septempunctata L. (Coleoptera:\n115 Coccinellidae) use an autumn aggregation pheromone to locate overwintering sites. There\nControl of Harmonia axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 2-11-2007 Pages : 18\nArticle No. : 9136 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO639R2 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n116 is no current information on the chemical nature of these aggregation pheromones or\n117 whether they are species specific or, indeed, seasonally specific (active only in autumn).\n118 Nalepa et al. (2000, 2005) investigated factors influencing aggregation behaviour and\n119 found little evidence for volatile aggregation pheromones. Their results suggest that beetles\n120 are rather attracted by visual intensity contrast and by contact chemoreception with con-\n121 specifics or the faeces and residues that persist in aggregation sites from previous years.\n122 However, if an aggregation semiochemical specific to H. axyridis could be produced, it\n123 would be possible to utilise this in a \u2018\u2018lure and kill\u2019\u2019 strategy for controlling this species in\n124 sensitively determined areas. A recent paper suggests that two volatile sesquiterpenes, (E)-\n125 b-farnesene (aphid alarm pheromone) and (-)-b-caryophyllene (isolated from the head-\n126 space volatiles above H. axyridis aggregations in winter), are ecologically relevant to\n127 H. axyridis (Verheggen et al. 2007). (E)-b-farnesene elicited electroantennogram (EAG)\n128 and behavioural responses within an olfactometer in both male and female H. axyridis. In\n129 contrast, (-)-b-caryophyllene resulted in EAG and behavioural activity (attraction) in male\n130 H. axyridis but only EAG activity in female beetles (no associated behavioural response\n131 within an olfactometer). However, interestingly Verheggen et al. (2007) demonstrated in a\n132 bioassay that both male and female H. axyridis aggregated in the (-)-b-caryophyllene-\n133 treated side of a ventilated plastic box as opposed to the untreated side. Perhaps the\n134 presence of the male H. axyridis evokes the response of the females. The authors conclude\n135 that (E)-b-farnesene and (-)-b-caryophyllene could have potential use within a push\u2013pull\n136 control strategy for H. axyridis, but it is possible that H. axyridis exhibits different\n137 antennal sensitivity to (-)-b-caryophyllene in relation to season, responding more in\n138 winter. The complexity of insect behavioural responses to semiochemicals should be\n139 assessed thoroughly when considering manipulating insects as a component of an IPM\n140 strategy.\n141 Trapping methods based on aggregative pheromones are commonly used for the\n142 monitoring and control of scolytid bark beetles (Byers 2004). A sap beetle, Carpophilus\n143 lugubris Murray (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) was successfully controlled at overwintering\n144 locations, with minimal impacts on other insect species, using an autoinoculative device\n145 baited with aggregation pheromone and the fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana (Bal-\n146 samo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) (Dowd and Vega 2003). A combination of\n147 the fungal pathogen Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Sorokin (Ascomycota: Hypocre-\n148 ales) and an attractant (phenethyl propionate: eugenol: geraniol) has shown potential for\n149 controlling Japanese beetle Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) (Klein\n150 and Lacey 1999). These systems could be appropriately designed for controlling H. axy-\n151 ridis, however, recent studies have shown that H. axyridis is relatively resilient to fungal\n152 (B. bassiana) mortality (Roy et al. 2008b). It is possible that a synthetic insecticide could\n153 be used in an attractant trap which would provide a targeted method of control with limited\n154 impacts on non-target insects and the environment.\n155 Chemical control\n156 Many insecticides have been tested against H. axyridis, but rather to test the non-target\n157 impact of insecticides used against aphids and other pests than to assess their potential use\n158 against the ladybird (see Koch 2003, for a review, and Galvan et al. 2005a, b, 2006d for the\n159 most recent investigations). These studies showed that most insecticides commonly used in\n160 agricultural environments are toxic to H. axyridis. Larvae were more sensitive than adults\n161 and, in general, the toxicity of the insecticides was lower to the ladybird than to aphids.\nM.

(2006a), Inclan et al. (2006) and Williams et al. (2006) recently carried out field\n163 and laboratory evaluation of the efficacy and suitability of insecticides for management of\n164 H. axyridis in vineyards. One of the limiting factors of using insecticides is that many of them,\n165 e.g. most pyrethroids, have a pre-harvest interval of several weeks whereas, to be efficient,\n166 treatments should be applied within a week before harvest (Galvan et al. 2006a). Among the\n167 most efficient compounds, only carbaryl and imidacloprid were labelled for use on wine grape\n168 within 7 days of harvest in USA at the time of the study (Galvan et al. 2006a). Insecticide\n169 treatments against H. axyridis in vineyards should not be carried out preventively but should\n170 rather follow decision protocols based on rigorous sampling plans and well defined action\n171 thresholds (Galvan et al. 2006a, 2007). In addition, the potential effect of such treatments on\n172 non-target beneficial organisms should be investigated.\n173 In North America, it is sometimes advised to apply insecticides, as a preventive method,\n174 to the exterior of buildings that are regularly infested year after year (McCutcheon and\n175 Scott 2001; Jones and Boggs 2002; Baniecki et al. 2004; Potter and Townsend 2005).\n176 Application of a residual formulation of synthetic pyrethroids (e.g. bifenthrin, cyfluthrin,\n177 cypermethrin, deltamethrin, etc.) to walls and sidings, around eaves, attic vents, windows,\n178 doors and other likely points of entry, in late-September\u2013October, i.e. just before beetles\n179 enter the structure is recommended. Insecticide use inside buildings is usually not advised\n180 (McCutcheon and Scott 2001; Potter and Townsend 2005) and the application of chemicals\n181 in other overwintering sites has never been considered.\n182 Deterrents\n183 Deterrents could be employed to reduce H. axyridis populations in locations where their\n184 presence is undesired, for example, houses used as overwintering locations and vineyards.\n185 Harmonia axyridis reduces rates of feeding and oviposition in the presence of conspecific\n186 faeces but not with the faeces of Propylea japonica (Thunberg) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae);\n187 whereas P. japonica reduces feeding and oviposition in response to faeces of conspecifics\n188 and H. axyridis (Agarwala et al. 2003). This is hypothesised to reduce intra-guild predation\n189 (Agarwala et al. 2003). Further work could investigate the use of these pheromonal faecal\n190 volatiles as deterrents for H. axyridis. However, it is possible that these could act as\n191 deterrents to other ladybird species and so be detrimental by impacting on beneficial insects\n192 in agricultural systems. Some plant compounds, such as camphor or menthol have proved to\n193 be repellent toH. axyridis in field and laboratory tests and could be used to protect buildings\n194 (Riddick et al. 2000). However, under field conditions, camphor was ineffective after 48 h\n195 post-application (Riddick and Aldrich 2004). Laboratory bioassays also showed that\n196 H. axyridis is repelled by DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), a widely used insect\n197 repellent. A formulation of DEET plus paraffin had repellent activity for 23 days in the\n198 laboratory, but has not been field-tested (Riddick et al. 2004).\n199 Cultivation practices in fruit production and remedial treatment for tainted wine\n200 H. axyridis is often reported as a pest of fruit production in North America (Koch 2003;\n201 Kovach 2004). Nevertheless, the few studies on feeding activity suggest that it rarely\n202 causes primary injury on fruits, but rather feeds on damaged fruits (Koch et al. 2004;\n203 Kovach 2004; Galvan et al. 2006b). The main impact of the ladybird as a fruit pest is in\n204 vineyards when it aggregates in clusters of grapes, in particular those containing\nControl of Harmonia axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 2-11-2007 Pages : 18\nArticle No. : 9136 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO639R2 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n205 damaged berries, and is processed with the grapes, resulting in tainted, unmarketable\n206 wine or juice (Pickering et al. 2005). Several recommendations on cultivation practices\n207 in vineyards have been suggested to lower the impact of the ladybird in regions where\n208 H. axyridis causes recurrent problems to fruits, although these recommendations are not\n209 always based on rigorous studies. Key components of an IPM strategy against H. axy-\n210 ridis in vineyards include proper surveys for beetle densities before harvest and the\n211 determination of a threshold density, to assist in management decisions. Galvan et al.\n212 (2007) have described various sampling plans and assessed their usefulness. They found\n213 binomial sampling plans to be more accurate methods to measure beetle densities than\n214 enumerative plans. Kovach (2004) and Pickering et al. (2007) evaluated the threshold\n215 density for wine contamination to be about 0.9 and 1.3\u20131.5 beetle per kg of grapes,\n216 respectively, but the latter authors recommend a more conservative limit of 0.2\u20130.4\n217 beetles per kg of grapes above which interventions in the field or in the winery should be\n218 considered. Including berry injuries in the sampling procedures may also be useful since\n219 ladybirds are primarily found on damaged fruits (Galvan et al. 2007). Such damage is\n220 caused by a variety of mechanisms including by splitting, feeding by birds or other\n221 insects, disease (rot) etc. (Galvan et al. 2007). Growers could reduce berry injury by\n222 using irrigation to avoid long periods of drought and by avoiding injuring to berries\n223 when pruning or spraying. Selecting varieties with higher resistance or tolerance to\n224 splitting may also be envisaged, as a potential long-term measure, when vineyards are\n225 replanted through the normal process of renewing stock.\n226 Harvesting methods may have an impact on the density of beetles in harvested grapes.\n227 Beetles may be more likely to leave the grapes during day harvesting rather than during\n228 night harvesting (Anonymous 2005). Hand harvesting may be more favourable than\n229 mechanical harvesting because aggregations of beetles in grape clusters can be monitored\n230 during harvesting and infested grapes can be discarded. Beetles can be removed by shaking\n231 clusters, by hand or by using shaking tables, and by floating clusters in water or vacuum\n232 clusters (Galvan et al. 2006c). Shaker tables could also be used to monitor populations just\n233 before harvest. However, these methods result in significant increase in time, labour and\n234 costs of harvest (Galvan et al. 2006c). Managing the surrounding crops and vegetation\n235 could also be critical because beetles found in vineyards and orchards in autumn probably\n236 come from nearby aphid infestations. In North America, damage in vineyards is often\n237 associated with the presence of soybean infested by the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines\n238 Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), one of the preferred preys of H. axyridis, although the\n239 exact relationship between the proximity of soybean, soybean aphids and H. axyridis\n240 populations has not as yet been rigorously monitored.\n241 Studies are being made on refining agents and other technologies to restore the quality\n242 of wine tainted by H. axyridis (Pickering et al. 2006). The main compound responsible for\n243 the taint is 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IPMP), a component of the reflex bleeding\n244 fluid of H. axyridis (Pickering et al. 2005). IPMP concentrations in wine could be lowered\n245 by activated charcoal in white wine and deodorized oak in red wine, although these\n246 treatments do not translate into lower intensity of the sensory attributes associated with the\n247 taint. In contrast, oak chips were successful in reducing the intensity of the taint charac-\n248 teristics, probably through a masking effect (Pickering et al. 2006). However, this method\n249 does not completely remove the taint from contaminated wine and, furthermore, it cannot\n250 be used for all wine types, since many of them are not normally oaked. Thus, other\n251 solutions that may be suitable for all wine types need to be sought. Pickering et al. (2006)\n252 suggest searching for a technology to target and selectively bind IPMP, with subsequent\n253 removal of the complex from the juice or wine.\nM.

First, a species could be introduced from the\n257 region of origin of the pest to the region of introduction for permanent establishment, a\n258 method often called \u2018\u2018classical biological control\u2019\u2019. Second, in an \u2018\u2018augmentative biological\n259 control\u2019\u2019 programme, natural enemies can be increased through regular inundative or\n260 inoculative releases. Finally, in a \u2018\u2018conservation biological control\u2019\u2019 strategy, natural\n261 enemies already present on site can be favoured, e.g. through various cultural practices, to\n262 increase their impact on the target pest. All these methods could be developed and\n263 employed for controlling H. axyridis, albeit not with the same agents.\n264 Natural enemies reported, or tested against H. axyridis comprise pathogens, predators,\n265 parasitoids, nematodes and a parasitic mite. There is little information available on the\n266 importance of natural enemies in the population dynamics of H. axyridis in field condi-\n267 tions, particularly in its region of origin. Research on mortality factors in field conditions\n268 has been carried out in Japan (Osawa 1992, 1993) and South Korea (Park et al. 1996), but\n269 natural enemies in the largest part of its distribution range, i.e. China and Russia, are\n270 largely unknown. In Europe and North America, observations suggest that natural enemies\n271 are of little importance in the population dynamics of the ladybird.\n272 Pathogens\n273 There have been a number of studies focussing on the impact of entomopathogens on\n274 coccinellids. Undoubtedly, the literature on fungal entomopathogens dominates this field and\n275 is mainly from the perspective of natural mortality in overwintering populations or, more\n276 usually, the effect of biorational pesticides on non-target coccinellids. Entomopathogenic\n277 fungi are common natural enemies of insects and other arthropods worldwide (Roy et al.\n278 2006) and have considerable potential as biological control agents of pest insects.\n279 Two Hypocrealean fungi have been found infecting ladybirds: M. anisopliae (Ginsberg\n280 et al. 2002) and B. bassiana (James et al. 1995; Cottrell and Shapiro-Ilan 2003; Roy et al.\n281 2008b). Most research on the direct interactions between fungi and ladybirds has concen-\n282 trated onB. bassiana because of the potential non-target impact of this fungus when used as a\n283 mycoinsecticide against various pest insects. Susceptibility of various ladybirds (Coleoptera:\n284 Coccinellidae) to B. bassiana has been demonstrated: Hippodamia convergens Gue\u00b4rin-\n285 Me\u00b4neville (James et al. 1995), A. bipunctata (Roy et al. 2008b), C. septempunctata (Roy\n286 et al. 2008b), Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake (Todorova et al. 1996, 2000), Ser-\n287 angium parcesetosum Sicard (Poprawski et al. 1998),Olla v-nigrum (Mulsant) (Cottrell and\n288 Shapiro-Ilan 2003) and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant (Smith and Krischik 2000). In\n289 contrast, a number of studies have demonstrated the resilience of H. axyridis to B. bassiana\n290 (Cottrell and Shapiro-Ilan 2003; Roy et al. 2008b). In North America one of the overwin-\n291 tering habitats ofH. axyridis is under bark in pecan orchards (Cottrell andShapiro-Ilan 2003).\n292 Adults of the native ladybirdO. v-nigrum are also found in this overwintering location and are\n293 commonly recorded infected with B. bassiana (Cottrell and Shapiro-Ilan 2003); whereas\n294 H. axyridis are not. Cottrell and Shapiro-Ilan (2003) demonstrated in laboratory studies that\n295 H. axyridis is extremely resistant to B. bassiana infection. Further studies using various\n296 isolates of B. bassiana support this notion. Roy et al. (2008b) showed that A. bipunctata and\n297 C. septempunctata are highly susceptible to doses of 107 spores ml-1 but even doses of\n298 B. bassiana exceeding 109 spores ml-1 have limited impact on H. axyridis. However,\nControl of Harmonia axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 2-11-2007 Pages : 18\nArticle No. : 9136 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO639R2 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n299 B. bassiana appears to have a sublethal effect on H. axyridis and even low doses\n300 (105 spores ml-1) reduce egg production significantly (Roy et al. 2008b).\n301 There is one further fungal entomopathogen of coccinellids worthy of note: Hesper-\n302 omyces virescens Thaxter (Ascomycota: Laboulbeniales). This intriguing fungus is an\n303 obligate ectoparasite that infects many coccinellids worldwide (Nalepa and Weir 2007).\n304 Hesperomyces virescens has been reported infecting Chilocorus stigma (Say) (Coleoptera:\n305 Coccinellidae) (Thaxter 1891), A. bipunctata (Welch et al. 2001), H. axyridis (Garce\u00b4s and\n306 Williams 2004), Chilocorus bipustulatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (Kamburov et al.\n307 1967; Applebaum et al. 1971), and Coccinula crotchi (Lewis) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)\n308 and Coccinula sinensis Weise (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (M. Majerus and R. Ware\n309 personal observation). This fungus is often reported on the ventroposterior of males and the\n310 dorsoposterior of females; a sexual dimorphism that reflects the major transmission\n311 mechanism which is thought to be via direct contact during mating (Weir and Beakes 1996;\n312 Welch et al. 2001; Riddick and Schaefer 2005). Nalepa and Weir (2007) have studied the\n313 interactions between H. virescens and H. axyridis in detail. In a field survey in North\n314 Carolina they demonstrated infection levels of 22\u201338% at the beginning of winter\n315 increasing to 62% by the end of winter. These overwintering ladybirds did not exhibit the\n316 characteristic elytral distribution of H. virescens as hypothesised by the sexual transmis-\n317 sion theory. In contrast, fungal thalli were distributed in accordance with direct contact\n318 through aggregation and orientation behaviour, notably on the anterior part of the body. A\n319 similar pattern was reported for A. bipunctata which, when collected from overwintering\n320 aggregations, had fungal thalli distributed at the margins and front angles of the elytra\n321 (Weir and Beakes 1996). Nalepa and Weir (2007) conclude that direct transmission\n322 through contact with conspecifics is the most important mechanism for transmission of\n323 H. virescens and sexual contact is of primary importance in the mating season but\n324 aggregation in winter also plays a significant role.\n325 Laboulbeniales characteristically do not penetrate the insect cuticle, however,\n326 H. virescens is one of the few species, in this family, to exhibit rhizoidal penetration into\n327 the host body by production of a circular appressorium, which attaches and penetrates the\n328 host cuticle (Weir and Beakes 1996). Even though this fungus invades the host there are no\n329 known deleterious impacts on the beetle (Nalepa and Weir 2007). However, H. virescens is\n330 suspected to have a negative effect on C. bipustulatus, through increased mortality\n331 (Applebaum et al. 1971; Kamburov et al. 1967). Heavy infections could also impede flight,\n332 foraging and mating but this requires further investigation.\n333 It is also of note that some Asian populations of H. axyridis are strongly female biased,\n334 due to the presence of a male-killing bacterium of the genus Spiroplasma (Majerus et al.\n335 1998). The bacterium is maternally inherited in the cytoplasm of eggs, but not sperm. As a\n336 consequence, it kills male hosts early in embryogenesis. In doing so, the male-killer makes\n337 the soma of these dead male eggs available as a food source to infected female sibling\n338 neonate larvae, providing them with a significant fitness advantage (Majerus and Hurst\n339 1997; Majerus 2006). Prevalence of this Spiroplasma in populations of H. axyridis in its\n340 native range is variable, but can reach 80%. The male-killer has not been reported from\n341 H. axyridis in its introduced range. Intuitively, it seems likely that introduction of male-\n342 killer infected females into populations of H. axyridis in Europe and North America would\n343 depress H. axyridis, because half the offspring (the males) of infected females would die in\n344 the eggs. The male-killer would spread naturally through the population to an equilibrium\n345 prevalence dictated by the vertical transmission efficiency of the male-killer ([0.99 for this\n346 Spiroplasma), any direct fitness effects that the male-killer has on females and the level of\n347 benefit gained by infected females as a result of the death and consumption of their male\nM.

The death of half the infected female\u2019s offspring would seem\n349 to be beneficial in reducing host population size, and consequently both intraguild com-\n350 petition and predation imposed by H. axyridis. However, this may not be the case in\n351 practice. As male H. axyridis can mate with many females, a bias in the sex ratio towards\n352 females is unlikely to lead to reduced fertility in females. Moreover, as H. axyridis larvae\n353 are highly cannibalistic, loss of a significant proportion of male progeny during embryo-\n354 genesis may simply lead to a reduction in cannibalism of immatures, and not to a reduction\n355 in the adult population. Finally, as female ladybirds eat considerably more than males\n356 (Hodek 1996), the level of intraguild competition may actually be increased as a result of\n357 biasing the population sex ratio in favour of females. Due to these uncertainties, use of a\n358 male-killer in an attempt to reduce H. axyridis populations should not be undertaken until a\n359 full analysis of the consequences of such an action has been conducted.\n360 Current research indicates that, under current knowledge, pathogens are unlikely to be\n361 suitable biological control agents for H. axyridis. The fungi examined so far (mainly\n362 B. bassiana) lack efficacy and specificity towards H. axyridis and could impact on non-\n363 target coccinellids and other insects. Nevertheless, the development of a novel strategy\n364 utilising pathogens as a component of a complex control strategy should not be ruled out.\n365 The sublethal effects of disease require further research and could provide a solution to\n366 controlling H. axyridis. Furthermore, H. axyridis should be screened throughout its native\n367 and non-native distribution to thoroughly assess the diversity of pathogens (fungi, protists,\n368 bacteria and viruses) and other \u2018\u2018hitchhikers\u2019\u2019 (nematodes and other parasites) associated\n369 with it. One of these could be the key to control.\n370 Predators\n371 As other ladybirds,H. axyridis is considered to be largely protected from generalist predators\n372 thanks to its alkaloid-rich defence secretions and its aposematic colouration. Nevertheless,\n373 Nechayev and Kuznedsov (1973) mention eight species of birds feeding on H. axyridis in\n374 Russia. Although Kuznetsov (1997) reports that the two bird species Picus canus Gmelin\n375 (Piciformes: Picidae) and Sitta europaeaL. (Passeriformes: Sittidae) will feed onH. axyridis\n376 in mass overwintering aggregations, he concludes that predation of coccinellids, including\n377 H. axyridis, by birds is generally rare. Eggs and larvae may also be preyed upon by other\n378 coccinellids (Pell et al. 2008; Ware and Majerus 2008) and by predatory bugs (De Clercq\n379 et al. 2003), although, in general, H. axyridis has better physical and chemical defences\n380 against predation than most ladybirds (see Pell et al. 2008, for review). It is also less attacked\n381 by ants and spiders than other ladydirds (Dutcher et al. 1999; Yasuda and Kimura 2001). It is\n382 very unlikely that any invertebrate or vertebrate predatorwill ever play a significant role in the\n383 natural control of H. axyridis in Europe or the Americas.\n384 Parasitoids\n385 Only two parasitoid species were found on H. axyridis in its introduction range and these\n386 have never been reported as being a significant source of mortality. The tachinid fly\n387 Strongygaster triangulifera (Loew) (Diptera: Tachinidae) was found in adult beetles in\n388 North Carolina (Nalepa et al. 1996; Nalepa and Kidd 2002) and Oregon (Katsoyannos and\n389 Aliniazee 1998). All were reared from overwintering beetles. Parasitism was very variable\n390 between sites and from year to year but, on average, only 2\u20134% of the beetles were\nControl of Harmonia axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 2-11-2007 Pages : 18\nArticle No. : 9136 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO639R2 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n391 parasitized. In Oregon, Katsoyannos and Aliniazee (1998) observed parasitism rates of\n392 6.7\u201315.4% by dissection and 4.8% by rearing. Strongygaster triangulifera is a small\n393 parasitic fly that is widely distributed in North America and very polyphagous. It is most\n394 frequently reported as a parasitoid of adult Coleoptera and there are scattered reports of\n395 parasitism within the Dermaptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera (Reeves and\n396 O0Hara 2004).\n397 The braconid wasp Dinocampus coccinellae (Schrank) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a\n398 common endoparasitoid of ladybirds in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Females usually\n399 parasitise adults, although larvae and pupae can also be attacked, in which case the\n400 development continues in the adult beetle (Obrycki et al. 1985). Dinocampus coccinellae\n401 is recorded from many ladybirds of the subfamily Coccinellinae but shows strong pref-\n402 erences for some large species. For example, in the UK it mainly attacks\n403 C. septempunctata, Coccinella undecimpunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Har-\n404 monia quadripunctata Pontoppidan (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (Majerus 1997). In North\n405 and South America it is most often recorded from Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) (e.g.\n406 Obrycki et al. 1985; Berti Filho and Costa 1995; Hoogendoorn and Heimpel 2002). It is\n407 occasionally observed on H. axyridis in North America (Hoogendoorn and Heimpel 2002;\n408 Firlej et al. 2005), Europe (Koyama and Majerus 2008) and East Asia (Liu 1950; Maeta\n409 1969; Park et al. 1996). In Europe and North America, H. axyridis is considered as a\n410 marginal host for D. coccinellae. Hoogendoorn and Heimpel (2002) compared parasitism\n411 in H. axyridis and the native ladybird C. maculata in the USA They found similar para-\n412 sitism rates by dissection of field-collected beetles, varying from 9% to 24%. But the\n413 emergence rate was much higher in C. maculata than in H. axyridis, hardly any parasitoid\n414 larvae being able to complete their development in H. axyridis. In laboratory assays,\n415 female wasps attack the two hosts readily, but larvae were found in 90% of the attacked\n416 C. maculata and in only 7% of the H. axyridis. Similar observations were made in Canada\n417 (Firlej et al. 2005) and, in the UK (Koyama and Majerus 2008). Koyama and Majerus\n418 (2008) have shown that while the attack rates of D. coccinellae on H. axyridis and\n419 C. septempunctata are similar, successful development in H. axyridis is much lower than\n420 in C. septempunctata. Firlej (2006) observed that, in H. axyridis, parasitism by D. cocc-\n421 inellae was successful only when the ladybird larvae were parasitised, whereas adults were\n422 attacked but no parasitoid developed in these adults. Firlej (2006) suggested that the poor\n423 performance of D. coccinellae in H. axyridis may be at least partly due to the lower\n424 number of teratocytes produced by the parasitoid in H. axyridis compared to suitable hosts.\n425 In Asia, D. coccinellae is less commonly reared from H. axyridis than from, e.g. Cocci-\n426 nella septempunctata brucki Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (Maeta 1969). However,\n427 successful parasitism is higher in Asia compared to Europe (Liu 1950; Maeta 1969; Park\n428 et al. 1996), suggesting either that Asian populations of D. coccinellae are better adapted\n429 to H. axyridis than European populations, or that invasive populations of H. axyridis are\n430 more resistant to D. coccinellae.\n431 Other parasitoids of H. axyridis are known only from their area of origin, but details on\n432 their impact, biology and ecology are scarce. The tachinid fly Medina (=Degeeria)\n433 luctuosa (Meigen) (Diptera: Tachinidae) was found in adult beetles collected in October\u2013\n434 November in Korea (Park et al. 1996). Parasitism rates fluctuated between 0.7% and\n435 21.1%. In laboratory rearing, parasitism by M. luctuosa shortened the life span and pre-\n436 vented egg development and oviposition. The true identity of this parasitoid is questionable\n437 because, in Europe, M. luctuosa is specific to adult chrysomelids of the genus Haltica,\n438 whereas many Coccinellidae, but not yet H. axyridis, are parasitized by a closely-related\n439 species, Medina separata (Meigen) (Diptera: Tachinidae), which was sometimes wrongly\nM.

A gregarious pupal parasitoid, the\n441 phorid fly Phalacrotophora philaxyridis Disney (Diptera: Phoridae) was described from\n442 Japan (Disney 1997). A congeneric species, Phalacrotophora fasciata (Falle\u00b4n) (Diptera:\n443 Phoridae) is reported from H. axyridis pupae in the Russian Far East by Kuznetsov (1997)\n444 and Park et al. (1996) cite a Phalacrotophora sp. parasitizing 0.4\u20136.7% of the pupae in\n445 Korea, 1\u20138 adults emerging from a single host pupa. The host range of P. philaxyridis is\n446 unknown but, in Europe, P. fasciata and another species, Phalacrotophora berolinensis\n447 Schmitz (Diptera: Phoridae), parasitize several coccinellid species (Hodek 1973; Majerus\n448 and Kearns 1989).\n449 From this survey, it appears that the potential of using parasitoids for the biological\n450 control of H. axyridis in its area of introduction is limited. The parasitoids found on\n451 H. axyridis in Europe and North America are of marginal importance and, in the case of\n452 D. coccinellae, not well adapted to H. axyridis. Thus, there is little prospect for their use in\n453 conservation or augmentative biological control programmes. The specificity of the par-\n454 asitoids found only in Asia remains to be investigated but they belong to genera that are\n455 known to comprise rather polyphagous species, at least within the family Coccinellidae. It\n456 must be noted, however, that our knowledge on the parasitoid complex of H. axyridis in its\n457 native range is based on a couple of studies in Japan and Korea, whereas the largest part of\n458 the native range has never been investigated for parasitism. The parasitoid complex of\n459 indigenous ladybirds often comprises more than three species. For example, at least seven\n460 parasitoids are known from C. septempunctata in Europe (Klausnitzer and Klausnitzer\n461 1997). Larval parasitism has never been recorded on H. axyridis, although several para-\n462 sitoids of the genera Aprostocetus, Oomyzus and Tetrastichus (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae),\n463 Homalotylus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) and Pachyneuron (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)\n464 are common larval parasitoids of Coccinellidae (Klausnitzer and Klausnitzer 1997; Noyes\n465 2007). Larval parasitism by Encyrtidae or Eulophidae may kill up to 90\u201395% of ladybird\n466 populations and severely affect their impact as aphid or coccid predators (Iperti 1964;\n467 Hodek 1973). Thus, it would be worthwhile investigating parasitism in H. axyridis in\n468 regions which have never or rarely been surveyed, such as China and Siberia. It remains to\n469 be seen whether a parasitoid may be found that is totally specific to H. axyridis, as this\n470 would be a pre-requirement for introduction into Europe or America. Most ladybird par-\n471 asitoids are specific to Coccinellidae or to coccinellid sub-families, but often rather\n472 polyphagous at family or sub-family level (Klausnitzer and Klausnitzer 1997). An\n473 exception may be Homalotylus platynaspidis Hofer (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), which, in\n474 Europe, may be specific to Platynaspis luteorubra (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)\n475 (Hodek 1973), although it has been recently reported from Scymnus subvillosus (Goeze)\n476 (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Russia (Noyes 2007).\n477 Nematodes\n478 To our knowledge, nematodes have never been recorded from wild populations of\n479 H. axyridis. Parasitic nematodes of the families Allantonematidae and Mermitidae are able\n480 to infest ladybird populations (Iperti 1964). For example, Iperti (1964) found a parasitic\n481 nematode (later described as Parasitylenchus coccinellinae Iperti & Van Waerebeke\n482 (Tylenchida: Allantonematidae) in Iperti and van Waerebeke 1968) parasitizing the\n483 intestine of adults of several ladybirds, particularly Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (L.)\n484 (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Oenopia conglobata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae).\nControl of Harmonia axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 2-11-2007 Pages : 18\nArticle No. : 9136 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO639R2 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n485 Parasitism rates in P. quatuordecimpunctata reached up to 46% in early autumn. The\n486 infection was not lethal, but strongly reduced egg maturation (Iperti 1964). Commercially\n487 available entomopathogenic nematodes (Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (Nematoda:\n488 Heterorhabditidae) and Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Nematoda: Steinernematidae)\n489 were tested on H. axyridis and other ladybirds by Shapiro-Ilan and Cottrell (2005) in the\n490 USA. They demonstrated that while H. axyridis and C. septempunctata (invasive alien\n491 species in USA) are susceptible to nematodes they were both more resistant than two\n492 native species (C. maculata and O. v-nigrum).\n493 Parasitic mite\n494 The mite Coccipolipus hippodamiae (McDaniel & Moril) (Acari: Podapolipidae) is a\n495 sexually transmitted ectoparasite of adult coccinellids in Europe (McDaniel and Morrill\n496 1969; Webberley et al. 2004). It lives on the ventral surface of the elytra. Larval C. hip-\n497 podamiae pass between male and female hosts during copulation, in either direction (Hurst\n498 et al. 1995). Once on a new host, larval mites embed their mouthparts into the ventral\n499 surface of the host elytra and feed on haemolymph, metamorphosing into adults. Within a\n500 few weeks, much of the ventral surface of the elytra is covered with mite adults, eggs and\n501 larvae (Webberley et al. 2002). In A. bipunctata, the mite has strong negative effects on\n502 male and female hosts, increasing overwintering mortality, particularly in males (Web-\n503 berley et al. 2002) and reducing both fecundity and egg viability in females, the latter\n504 eventually to zero (Hurst et al. 1995). Similar, but marginally less extreme, negative\n505 effects of the mite have been found on female Adalia decempunctata (L.) (Coleoptera:\n506 Coccinellidae) and O. conglobata (Webberley et al. 2004). Coccipolipus hippodamiae is\n507 found on a variety of coccinellids, but shows highest prevalence on A. bipunctata, where\n508 over 90% of some populations are infected by late summer (Webberley et al. 2004).\n509 Comparative analysis of prevalence levels of the mite, on four European coccinellids, has\n510 indicated that prevalence is positively correlated to promiscuity and voltinism (Webberley\n511 et al. 2006).\n512 Due to the high negative effects that C. hippodamiae imposes on its hosts, coupled to\n513 the behaviour and ecology of H. axyridis in Europe, this mite is a possible candidate for\n514 use as a biological control agent of H. axyridis. Importantly, H. axyridis has behavioural\n515 characteristics (high promiscuity, no requirement for dormancy before reproducing, mul-\n516 tivoltinism, over-lapping generations), to facilitate both horizontal transmission and\n517 transmission down the generations of the mite, leading to high prevalence once the mite\n518 has established. What is currently not known is whether C. hippodamiae can use\n519 H. axyridis as a host, and, if it can, whether the strong negative effects that the mite\n520 imposes on A. bipunctata will also be imposed on H. axyridis. Encouragingly, preliminary\n521 tests in which C. hippodamiae have been artificially transferred from wild French Har-\n522 monia quadripunctata to H. axyridis have shown that the mite can feed and survive on\n523 H. axyridis (M. Majerus unpublished data). Moreover, transfer to H. axyridis might come\n524 about naturally, for inter-specific hybrid matings between H. axyridis and A. bipunctata\n525 has been recorded in the field in Europe (Pascoe et al. 2007), and Webberley et al. (2004)\n526 report that mites can successfully transfer between species during interspecific hybrid\n527 matings. If it is proven that C. hippodamiae is detrimental to H. axyridis and if the transfer\n528 from European ladybirds does not occur naturally, artificially infested H. axyridis adults\n529 could be inoculated to field populations for further propagation. Coccipolipus hippodamiae\n530 also occurs in North America (McDaniel and Morrill 1969), and may thus have a role to\nM.

However, given the wide host range of the mite, an appropriate risk assessment\n532 would be required before integrating this biological control agent into management pro-\n533 grammes. An introduction to continents from which C. hippodamiae has not been reported\n534 (South America, Africa) should not be considered, although other congeneric mites with\n535 similar ecologies that occur on these continents may be considered as alternatives.\n536 The efficacy of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) such as C. hippodamiae and\n537 H. virescens as controlling agents for H. axyridis might be improved in an IPM strategy\n538 that also involves the male-killer of H. axyridis. In species in which both sexes are highly\n539 promiscuous, such as H. axyridis, the rate of spread of an STD will be greater in popu-\n540 lations in which sex ratios are female biased because males, due to their scarcity, will have\n541 more mating partners and so more opportunity to both contract and to pass on the disease\n542 (Majerus 2003). Thus, in a population of H. axyridis that is female biased due to the\n543 presence of a male-killer, an STD, such as C. hippodamiae, would reach higher prevalence\n544 than in a population with a 1:1 sex ratio.\n545 Conclusions\n546 Developing control methods against the harlequin ladybird remains a challenge, for several\n547 reasons. It is the first time a predatory ladybird, or any other predatory beetle, requires\n548 control. Thus, there is no previous experience on which to base new management strate-\n549 gies, and research to date has been very limited. Furthermore, as most other ladybirds are\n550 considered beneficial insects, control methods against H. axyridis will have to be highly\n551 specific to avoid non-target effects. Suitable control methods will continue to be developed\n552 to prevent or control aggregations in houses and fruit damage. Besides the use of chemical\n553 insecticides, which are efficient but should preferably be avoided to prevent their negative\n554 impact on human health and the environment, the most promising new strategies are the\n555 development of new cultural practices in vineyards and, especially of new trapping\n556 methods based on semiochemicals. Our current understanding of pheromonal and kairo-\n557 monal communication by coccinellids, and specifically H. axyridis, is still limited.\n558 However, there are many effective model systems using semiochemical methods for\n559 controlling pest insects, which could prove to be informative in developing strategies for\n560 controlling H. axyridis.\n561 While control methods presently used or under development may eventually solve the\n562 problems in buildings, orchards or vineyards, it is very unlikely that any of these methods\n563 will ever limit the impact of outbreak H. axyridis populations on native biodiversity.\n564 Unless a native European or America natural enemy (e.g. C. hippodamiae) adapts itself to\n565 the new invader and provides control, the only method that may eventually lower invasive\n566 population densities in a sustainable way is the importation of natural enemies from the\n567 region of origin. However, H. axyridis is a difficult target for classical biological control,\n568 partly because the invasion of H. axyridis is, in itself, most probably the result of bad\n569 biological control practices. Thus convincing the public, authorities and a part of the\n570 scientific community that a biological control agent needs to be introduced to control\n571 another biological control agent that turned bad may be challenging. In addition, a can-\n572 didate biological control agent should be specific to H. axyridis. The chance of finding a\n573 specific pathogen or parasitoid in Asia is low but not negligible. As in all classical bio-\n574 logical control programmes, the risk of introducing an exotic agent has to be weighted\n575 against the risk of doing nothing or the risk related to traditional control measures. In the\n576 case of H. axyridis, the introduction of a biological control agent should be considered\nControl of Harmonia axyridis\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 2-11-2007 Pages : 18\nArticle No. : 9136 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO639R2 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n577 only if there are clear signs that native ladybirds, or other aphidophagous insects, are\n578 seriously threatened over a significant part of their distribution range. At present, the\n579 priority for research is to gather more reliable and quantitative data on the exact impact of\n580 H. axyiridis on the native fauna in the invaded regions. In the meantime, comparative\n581 assessments of mortality factors affecting populations of H. axyridis in the native range\n582 and the areas of introduction should be carried out, e.g. through life table analysis, to\n583 understand which factors limit population densities in the native range and which do not\n584 occur in the regions of introduction. These studies would also allow the identification of\n585 potential classical biological control agents that could be considered for introduction,\n586 should the situation in the invaded regions become dramatic for native biodiversity.\n587 Finally, it must be noted that, in North America, there are various agricultural contexts\n588 where H. axyridis is highly valued as a biological control agent, particularly in corn,\n589 soybeans, citrus and apples (Koch 2003; Pervez and Omkar 2006). A control method that\n590 would provide area wide reductions in H. axyridis populations might also result in reduced\n591 levels of aphid biocontrol and, thus, create a conflict of interest between the agricultural\n592 sector and conservationists.\n593 Acknowledgements Marc Kenis and Renate Zindel are supported by a grant from the Swiss Federal\n594 Office for the Environment (F232-0377) and the EU FP6 project ALARM (GOCE-CT-2003-506675).\n5956\n597 References\n598 Adriaens T, Branquart E, Maes D (2003) The multicoloured Asian ladybird Harmonia axyridis Pallas\n599 (Coleoptera : Coccinellidae), a threat for native aphid predators in Belgium?
