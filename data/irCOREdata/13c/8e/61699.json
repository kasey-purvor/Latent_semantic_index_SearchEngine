Derivation of likelihood function for flights in\n2004\nFor the 2004 data, the wet\/dry status of each of 20 birds was recorded every 10 s by\nthe salt-water loggers. Locations were recorded by GPS devices, at a resolution of\napproximately 1 h. The GPS data were used to calculate when each bird departed\nthe colony. These departure times were used to determine the true initial flight\ndurations, eliminating the long initial series of dry readings that do not represent\nflights (e.g. Fig. 2 for the 1992 data set). Such dry readings commence when\nthe logger is switched on at a computer, and include the time taken to attach the\nlogger to a bird, and the time that the bird spends on the nest before finally flying.\n4\nDurations of final flights for each trip were also calculated in a similar manner.\nThe data set for each bird therefore consists of a wet\/dry reading every 10 s.\nWe thus have discrete data from which we want to infer the continuous probabil-\nity density function (pdf) of flight durations. Here we develop a multinomial31\nlikelihood approach to this, that takes into account the fact that the (continuous)\ntrue flight durations have been recorded in a discrete manner. This is more im-\nportant for the shorter flights than the longer ones of, say, 1 h. We then take a\nsimilar approach to derive the likelihood function for the 1992 data set, for which\nall recorded flights are \u2265 1 h and ignoring the sampling protocol does profoundly\nimpact the results.\nAn example sequence of wet\/dry readings is wet-dry-dry-dry-dry-wet, each\n10 s apart \u2013 the bird was on the water and then undertook a short flight before\nlanding. We define a record to be the number of consecutive dry readings in-\nbetween two wet readings; thus the example gives a record of 4. This record\ncorresponds to a true flight duration that may be anywhere in the range 30-50 s.\nIf the bird took off just before the first dry reading, and then landed just after the\nfinal dry reading then the flight lasted just over 30 s. Whereas at the other extreme,\nif the bird took off just after the first wet reading and landed just before the final\n5\nwet reading then the flight lasted just under 50 s.\nWe consider 30 s to be the minimum dry time that represents a true flight\nbetween food sources. Shorter dry times may simply be a bird lifting its leg out of\nthe water to scratch, or could correspond to an abandoned take off. Thus we ignore\nrecords of 1, 2 and 3, as these would include such short flights. Our conclusions\nwould be unaffected by using, say, 60 s instead of 30 s as the minimum.\nFollowing ref. 7, the data for all birds were pooled. The resulting data set\nconsists of a set of records (separate flights) r = {ri}, with i = 1, 2, 3, ..., 1416,\nand each ri being an integer. The full data set is shown in the rank\/frequency plot\nin Fig. 1 of the main paper, where for simplicity a record of, say, 6 is plotted as\na flight of duration t = 60 s (even though this record may represent a true flight\nof duration 50-70s \u2013 but this is clearly only an issue for the very shortest flights).\nNote that there can be multiple flights that have the same value of t, and so these\ngive multiple circles with consecutive ranks on the ordinate of Fig. 1. Because the\nfitted distribution, to be calculated shortly, reaches 30 s, we also show records of 3\nin Fig. 1, even though, as just discussed, these were not included in the statistical\nanalysis. The rank\/frequency plot is clearly not a straight line, indicating that the\ndata are not power-law distributed. We now develop the statistical analysis to test\n6\nwhether the data are consistent with coming from a shifted gamma distribution.\nDefine the pdf of flight durations (which is what we want to determine) as\nf(x; \u03b8), where x is the random variable representing a flight duration (in s), and \u03b8\nis a vector of parameters. We will find the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs)\nfor the parameters, by maximizing the log-likelihood function18, 19 l(\u03b8|r) defined\nby\nl(\u03b8|r) = log[L(\u03b8|r)] (11)\n= log[P(r|\u03b8)] (12)\n= log\n[\nn\u220f\ni=1\nP(ri|\u03b8)\n]\n(13)\n=\nn\u2211\ni=1\nlog [P(ri|\u03b8)] , (14)\nwhere L(\u03b8|r) is the likelihood function for \u03b8 given the data r, n = 1416 is the\ntotal number of flights and P(ri|\u03b8) is the probability of obtaining a record ri when\nthe parameters in the pdf are given by \u03b8.\nClearly, some values of ri will be repeated. So we define dj to be the number\nof records that equal j, where j = 1, 2, 3, ..., J , and J = maxi(ri) is the maximum\nrecord. Note that \u2211Jj=1 dj = n. Since only records of 4 and above are considered,\nwe have d1 = d2 = d3 = 0.\n7\nSo the multinomial log-likelihood function31 is\nl(\u03b8|r) =\nJ\u2211\nj=1\ndj log [P(j|\u03b8)] . (15)\nFor a single flight, if R is the random variable representing the value of the\nrecord, then\nP(R = j|\u03b8) =\n\u222b\n\u221e\n0\nP(R = j|flight duration is x)f(x; \u03b8)dx, (16)\nfor integer values of j = 1, 2, 3, ..., J . Next, define the random variable U to be\nthe time from a bird taking off from the water to the time of the next dry reading\nby the salt-water logger. Then, for each flight, U is uniformly distributed on the\ninterval [0, 10) seconds, such that its pdf is\ngU(u) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1\n10\n, u \u2208 [0, 10)\n0, otherwise.\n(17)\nThen to obtain a record j, the x\u2212U interval that commences at the first dry reading\nmust last long enough to get a further j \u2212 1 dry readings, but not last long enough\nto get j more. Thus\nP(R = j|flight duration is x) = P (10(j \u2212 1) \u2264 x\u2212 U < 10j) (18)\n= P (10(j \u2212 1)\u2212 x \u2264 \u2212U < 10j \u2212 x) (19)\n= P (x\u2212 10j < U \u2264 x\u2212 10(j \u2212 1)) (20)\n8\n=\n\u222b x\u221210(j\u22121)\nx\u221210j\ngU(u)du, (21)\nwhere the final line comes from the known pdf of U .\nThe two limits of the integral are 10 s apart, and so given x there are two\ncases:\ni) The top limit of the integral is in [0, 10) and therefore the bottom limit is not,\ni.e. x\u2212 10(j \u2212 1) \u2208 [0, 10), such that x \u2208 [10(j \u2212 1), 10j). Then, from (17),\n\u222b x\u221210(j\u22121)\nx\u221210j\ngU(u)du =\n\u222b x\u221210(j\u22121)\n0\n1\n10\ndu (22)\n=\nx\u2212 10(j \u2212 1)\n10\n. (23)\nii) The bottom limit of the integral is in [0, 10) and therefore the top limit is not,\ni.e. x\u2212 10j \u2208 [0, 10), such that x \u2208 [10j, 10(j + 1)). Then, from (17),\n\u222b x\u221210(j\u22121)\nx\u221210j\ngU(u)du =\n\u222b 10\nx\u221210j\n1\n10\ndu (24)\n=\n10\u2212 x+ 10j\n10\n. (25)\nThese two cases simplify to\nP(R = j|flight duration is x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1 + x\n10\n\u2212 j, x \u2208 [10(j \u2212 1), 10j)\n1\u2212 x\n10\n+ j, x \u2208 [10j, 10(j + 1))\n0, otherwise.\n(26)\n9\nSo, say that a bird flies for x seconds, with x \u2208 [60, 70). Then P(R = 7|x) =\n1 + x\/10\u2212 7, from setting j = 7 in (26), and P(R = 6|x) = 1\u2212 x\/10 + 6, from\nsetting j = 6 in (26). As required, these two probabilities sum to 1 and no other\nrecords are possible for this flight.\nNow, (16) becomes\nP(R = j|\u03b8) =\n\u222b 10j\n10(j\u22121)\n(\n1 +\nx\n10\n\u2212 j\n)\nf(x; \u03b8)dx+\n\u222b 10(j+1)\n10j\n(\n1\u2212\nx\n10\n+ j\n)\nf(x; \u03b8)dx\n(27)\n=\n\u222b 10(j+1)\n10(j\u22121)\nf(x; \u03b8)dx\u2212\n\u222b 10j\n10(j\u22121)\n(\nj \u2212\nx\n10\n)\nf(x; \u03b8)dx\n\u2212\n\u222b 10(j+1)\n10j\n(\nx\n10\n\u2212 j\n)\nf(x; \u03b8)dx. (28)\nThe first term in (28) represents all flights in the range 10(j\u2212 1) to 10(j+1), and\nthe second and third terms then reduce this to account for the sampling protocol.\nA formulation that is useful numerically is\nP(R = j|\u03b8) = (1\u2212 j)\n\u222b 10j\n10(j\u22121)\nf(x; \u03b8)dx+ (1 + j)\n\u222b 10(j+1)\n10j\nf(x; \u03b8)dx\n+\n1\n10\n[\u222b 10j\n10(j\u22121)\nxf(x; \u03b8)dx\u2212\n\u222b 10(j+1)\n10j\nxf(x; \u03b8)dx\n]\n. (29)\nSince flights of less than 30 s are not considered to be part of the food-\nsearching mechanism that we are modelling, we have f(x; \u03b8) = 0 for x < 30.\n10\nTherefore,\nP(R = 1|\u03b8) = 0,\nP(R = 2|\u03b8) = 0,\nP(R = 3|\u03b8) = 4\n\u222b 40\n30\nf(x; \u03b8)dx\u2212 1\n10\n\u222b 40\n30\nxf(x; \u03b8)dx. (30)\nNow, we have records of R = 3 in the data, but some of these will represent dry\ntimes in the range 20-40 s. In the model, and thus (30), we have taken f(x; \u03b8) = 0\nfor x < 30 s (see Methods). Since we exclude records of 3 from the data (but the\nprobability of getting such a record is non-zero), to make the remaining P(R =\nj|\u03b8) sum to 1 in the multinomial log-likelihood function we need to divide each\nprobability by 1 \u2212 P(R = 3|\u03b8). For the log-likelihood function, this translates\nto inserting the definitions P(R = j|\u03b8) from (28) into (15), and then subtracting\nn log(1\u2212 P(R = 3|\u03b8)) from the log-likelihood function.\nThe multinomial log-likelihood function (15) then becomes\nl(\u03b8|r) =\nJ\u2211\nj=1\ndj log\n{\u222b 10(j+1)\n10(j\u22121)\nf(x; \u03b8)dx\u2212\n\u222b 10j\n10(j\u22121)\n(\nj \u2212\nx\n10\n)\nf(x; \u03b8)dx\n\u2212\n\u222b 10(j+1)\n10j\n(\nx\n10\n\u2212 j\n)\nf(x; \u03b8)dx\n}\n\u2212 n log(1\u2212 P(R = 3|\u03b8)).\n(31)\nThis is the function to be maximized with respect to the parameters in \u03b8.

All computations were performed using R, version 2.2.0\n(www.r-project.org).\n12\nSupplementary Methods 2. Derivation of likelihood function for flights in\n1992\nFirst, in Supplementary Fig. 6 we show the raw 1992 logger data, before and\nafter adjustments of the first and last dry sequences. These are the same data as\nin Fig. 3a, but plotted on linear axes and not binned. Plotting this way clearly\nidentifies the individual long sequences that get removed. In Fig. 3c we show the\nsame data as a rank-frequency plot, as in Fig. 1 for the 2004 data.\nThe 1992 data were obtained from salt-water loggers, but the sampling pro-\ntocol was different to that for the 2004 data. In 1992, the devices took a wet\/dry\nreading every 3 s. For every 15 s interval, a bird was considered to be on the water\nif the logger was wet for 9 s or more. Due to data storage limitations, the logger\nonly saved the total number of 15 s intervals in each hour for which the bird was\nconsidered wet. Thus the time series for each bird consisted of a number from\n0 to 240 every hour (e.g. Fig. 1 of ref. 7). Thus, flights shorter than 1 h could\nnot be directly inferred from the data, because a wet count of 60, for example,\ncould imply one flight of 45 minutes ( [240-60]\/240 of an hour), or several shorter\nflights interspersed by landings. So in ref. 7, consecutive hourly wet counts of 0,\nin between non-zero hours, were used to give flight times of 1, 2, 3, ... hours. A\n13\nsequence of hours that goes wet-dry-wet was then assumed to be a flight of 1 h.\nHowever, such a 1 h record of dry readings could come from a true flight\nanywhere in the range 1-3 h. For example, consider the situation where the hourly\ncounts started at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00 and 13:00, and a bird took off at 10:15 for\na 2.5 h flight, landing again at 12:45. Then only the 11:00-12:00 hourly record\nwould be completely dry, and so in ref. 7 this 2.5 h flight would have been con-\nsidered to be a 1 h flight. Similarly, some flights of duration 1-2 h will not give a\ncompletely dry hour, and so will not get recorded at all in the data. Here we mod-\nify the approach developed above for the 2004 data to take both of these factors\ninto account, and obtain the relevant likelihood function to infer the distribution\nof actual flight durations.\nWe define the pdf of true flight durations as g(t; \u03b8), where t is the random\nvariable representing a flight duration (in hours), and \u03b8 is again a vector of pa-\nrameters. The data set is the set of records v = {vi}, i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N , with\neach record vi being a number of consecutive dry hours recorded between two\nwet hours, and N = 335 is the number of flight records (pooled for all birds) in\nthe data set.\n14\nAnalogous to (15), we want to determine and maximize the multinomial\nlog-likelihood function l(\u03b8|v) given by\nl(\u03b8|v) =\nJv\u2211\nj=1\ncj log [P(j|\u03b8)] , (33)\nwhere cj is the number (count) of records that equal j, Jv = maxi(vi) is the\nmaximum record, and P(j|\u03b8) is the probability of obtaining a record j when the\nparameters are \u03b8.\nFor a single flight, if V is the random variable representing the value of the\nrecord, then\nP(V = v|\u03b8) =\n\u222b\n\u221e\n0\nP(V = v|flight duration is t)g(t; \u03b8)dt. (34)\nWe will later substitute this into (33), replacing v by j.\nConsidering only flights \u2265 1 h, we define the random variable Uh to be the\ntime (in h) between a bird taking off and the start of the next hourly block of 240\nmeasurements. Then, Uh is uniformly distributed on the interval [0, 1) hours, such\nthat its pdf is simply\ngUh(uh) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1, uh \u2208 [0, 1)\n0, otherwise.\n(35)\n15\nThen, analogous to (18)-(21),\nP(V = v|flight duration is t) = P (v \u2264 t\u2212 Uh < v + 1) (36)\n= P (v \u2212 t \u2264 \u2212Uh < v \u2212 t+ 1) (37)\n= P (t\u2212 v \u2212 1 < Uh \u2264 t\u2212 v) (38)\n=\n\u222b t\u2212v\nt\u2212v\u22121\ngUh(uh)duh. (39)\nThe two limits of the integral are 1 h apart, and so given t there are two\ncases:\ni) The top limit of the integral is in [0, 1) and therefore the bottom limit is not, i.e.\nt\u2212 v \u2208 [0, 1), such that t \u2208 [v, v + 1). Then\n\u222b t\u2212v\nt\u2212v\u22121\ngUh(uh)duh =\n\u222b t\u2212v\n0\n1 duh (40)\n= t\u2212 v. (41)\nii) The bottom limit is in [0, 1) and therefore the top limit is not, i.e. t \u2212 v \u2212 1 \u2208\n[0, 1), such that t \u2208 [v + 1, v + 2). Then\n\u222b t\u2212v\nt\u2212v\u22121\ngUh(uh)duh =\n\u222b 1\nt\u2212v\u22121\n1 duh (42)\n= 2\u2212 t+ v. (43)\n16\nThese two cases simplify to\nP(V = v|flight duration is t) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nt\u2212 v, t \u2208 [v, v + 1)\n2\u2212 t+ v, t \u2208 [v + 1, v + 2)\n0, otherwise,\n(44)\nfor v > 0. So say a bird flies for t hours with t \u2208 [5, 6). Then P(V = 5|t) = t\u22125,\nfrom setting v = 5 in (44), and P(V = 4|t) = 6 \u2212 t, from setting v = 4 in (44).\nAs required, these two probabilities sum to 1 and no other records are possible.\nFor v = 0,\nP(V = 0|flight duration is t) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1, t \u2208 [0, 1)\n2\u2212 t, t \u2208 [1, 2)\n0, otherwise,\n(45)\ni.e. all flights < 1 h yield a record of 0, and so do some flights of duration 1-2h.\nThese latter flights would not be present in the data set.\nNow, for v > 0 equation (34) becomes\nP(V = v|\u03b8) =\n\u222b v+1\nv\n(t\u2212 v)g(t; \u03b8)dt+\n\u222b v+2\nv+1\n(2\u2212 t+ v)g(t; \u03b8)dt.\nFor v = 0 we insert (45) into (34) to obtain\nP(V = 0|\u03b8) =\n\u222b 1\n0\ng(t; \u03b8)dt+\n\u222b 2\n1\n(2\u2212 t)g(t; \u03b8)dt. (46)\n17\nWe do not have records of v = 0 in the data. So analogous to the incorpo-\nration of (30) for the 2004 data, but for a different reason, for v > 0 we need to\ndivide each P(V = v|\u03b8) by 1 \u2212 P(V = 0|\u03b8). Then the multinomial probabilities\nsum to 1 in the likelihood function. Again, we insert the definitions P(V = v|\u03b8)\nfrom (46) into (33), replacing v by j, and subtract N log(1 \u2212 P(V = 0|\u03b8)) from\nthe log-likelihood function.\nThe resulting multinomial log-likelihood function (33) is then\nl(\u03b8|v) =\nJv\u2211\nj=1\ncj log\n{\u222b j+1\nj\n(t\u2212 j)g(t; \u03b8)dt+\n\u222b j+2\nj+1\n(2\u2212 t+ j)g(t; \u03b8)dt\n}\n\u2212N log(1\u2212 P(V = 0|\u03b8)). (47)\nThis is the function to be maximized to find the MLEs and confidence intervals\nfor the parameters in \u03b8, and to be used in goodness-of-fit tests.\nTo test for the shifted gamma distribution of flight durations, as for the 2004\ndata, we have\ng(t; \u03b8) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nrs\n\u0393 (s)\n(\nt\u2212 1\n120\n)s\u22121\ne\u2212r(t\u22121\/120), t > 1\n120\n0, t \u2264 1\n120\n.\n(48)\nwhere t is in hours, s is the shape parameter, r is the rate parameter in h\u22121, and\n1\/120 = 30\/3600 is the conversion of 30 s into hours.\n18\nSupplementary Methods 3. Calculations of the expected number of misclas-\nsified flight durations for 1992 data\nFrom the above calculations for the 1992 data, it is clear that errors can arise from\nassuming that all flights in the range 1-2 h yielded records of 1. Furthermore,\nflights in the range 2-3 h can yield records of 1. In ref. 7 it was implicitly assumed\nthat a record of 1 represented a flight of 1-2 h, and no account was taken of the data\nsampling protocol. The results in Fig. 3b show that the data-sampling protocol and\nbinning procedure do need to be properly accounted for to determine the expected\ndistribution of flight durations.\nAssuming that the pdf (48) with MLE values represents the true distribution\nof flight durations, we now determine the expected number of true flights that\nwould have been in the range 1-2 h but were missed completely by the sampling\nprotocol (as they would have ended up with a record of 0).\nWe first calculate Nf , the expected total number of flights (including those\nthat did not get recorded) that would have been required to yield the 335 records.\nThus Nf consists of the 335 recorded flights (that by definition were all \u2265 1 h),\nplus the flights of 1-2 h that did not get recorded, plus the flights < 1 h (that were\n19\nnot recorded).\nThe 335 records are those > 0, thus\n[1\u2212 P(V = 0|\u03b8\u02c6)]Nf = 335, (49)\nwhere 1 \u2212 P(V = 0|\u03b8\u02c6) is the probability of getting a record > 0, given that the\nparameters take the MLE values \u03b8 = \u03b8\u02c6. Using the known \u03b8\u02c6, we have\nP(V = 0|\u03b8\u02c6) = 0.534, (50)\ni.e. over half of the Nf flights are expected to give a record of 0, and thus will not\nexplicitly show up in the data (many of them will be < 1 h). Then\nNf = 719, (51)\nof which 335 are expected to give records \u2265 1 and thus be detected in the data.\nThe expected number of 0 records resulting from flights of duration t \u2208\n[1, 2), which we will call E0, is given by\nE0 = P(V = 0|t \u2208 [1, 2))\u00d7 P(t \u2208 [1, 2))\u00d7Nf (52)\n=\n\u222b 2\n1\nP(V = 0|t)g(t; \u03b8\u02c6)dt\u00d7Nf (53)\n=\n\u222b 2\n1\n(2\u2212 t)g(t; \u03b8\u02c6)dt\u00d7Nf (54)\n= 78, (55)\n20\nwhere we have used (45) with v = 0 to obtain (54), and rounded to the nearest\ninteger (and shall continue to do so where appropriate).\nThe expected total number of flights in the range [1, 2) is\n\u222b 2\n1\ng(t; \u03b8\u02c6)dt\u00d7Nf = 143. (56)\nThus, we expect there to be 143 flights of duration 1-2 h, of which 78 will not be\ndirectly detected by the data. So simply considering records of 1 to represent all\nthe 1-2 h flights is incorrect.\nFinally, we calculate the expected number of flights of duration 2-3 h that\nwill give a record of 1 h (call this E1). These would have been incorrectly consid-\nered to be flights in the range 1-2 h in ref. 7. Similarly to above, we have\nE1 =\n\u222b 3\n2\nP(V = 1|t)g(t; \u03b8\u02c6)dt\u00d7Nf (57)\n=\n\u222b 3\n2\n(3\u2212 t)g(t; \u03b8\u02c6)dt\u00d7Nf (58)\n= 47, (59)\nwhere we have used (44) with v = 1 to obtain (58). Analogous to (56), we expect\na total of 88 flights in the range 2-3 h. So of these 88 flights we expect 47 to yield\na record of 1, and thus these 47 would have been incorrectly assumed in ref. 7 to\nrepresent flights of duration 1-2 h.\n21\nSo in summary, in the data there were 102 records of 1, and 92 of 2, which\nwould have been considered in ref. 7 to respectively represent flights in the ranges\n1-2 h and 2-3 h. However, here we have shown that we would expect there to\nbe (based on the MLE values) 143 real flights in the range 1-2 h, of which only\n65 would yield a record of 1, the remaining 78 giving a record of 0 and thus not\nbe detected by the data. And we would expect 88 true flights in the range 2-3 h,\nbut that 47 of these would yield a record of 1, and therefore have been incorrectly\nconsidered to be of duration 1-2 h.\nSupplementary Methods 4. Likelihood function for a power law over a bounded\nrange for prebinned data\nThe bumblebee and deer data shown in ref. 10 were digitized from histograms\npresented in the original papers27, 28. Here we develop a likelihood approach to\nanalyze these data sets. The methods are general and so can be applied to any\nbinned data set.\nWe want to test whether a power law occurs over a given range [a, b]. Thus,\nthe pdf is\nf(x) = Cx\u2212\u00b5, x \u2208 [a, b], (60)\n22\nwhere C is the normalization constant given by C = (\u00b5\u22121)\/(a1\u2212\u00b5\u2212b1\u2212\u00b5), which\nis obtained by solving\n\u222b b\na f(x)dx = 1. We are only considering the distribution of\ndata that lie in the range [a, b]. This formulation requires explicit specification of\nthe range over which power-law behaviour is being tested. It is commonly stated\nthat a power law occurs over \u2018the tail of the distribution\u2019, and a line drawn or fitted\nover this range, without qualification as to how the tail [a, b] is determined.\nConsider the data to be counts dj in bins indexed by j = 1, 2, 3, ..., J , defin-\ning J to be the index of the final bin. Let w be the bin width (assumed equal for\nall bins), such that first bin covers the range a to a + w, and the right-hand side\nof the final bin is a+ Jw. The maximum value that we consider attainable by the\ndata, b, thus satisfies b \u2265 a + Jw. Simply taking b to equal a + Jw assumes that\nthe maximum data point recorded represents the maximum possible attainable (to\nwithin w). This is unlikely to occur in practice, particularly for small data sets,\nand especially in a power-law situation. This is a subtle point that has received\nlittle attention.\nWe define b = a+J \u2032w, where integer J \u2032 \u2265 J . Therefore new bins J+1, J+\n2, ..., J \u2032 have counts of 0, and so dJ+1 = dJ+2 = ... = dJ \u2032 = 0. This allows the\npossibility that measurements could attain values higher than those that happen to\n23\nbe sampled in the particular data set being studied.\nFor a single data value, the probability of being in bin j given the parameter\n\u00b5 is\nP(being in bin j|\u00b5) =\n\u222b a+jw\na+(j\u22121)w\nCx\u2212\u00b5dx (61)\n=\nC\n1\u2212 \u00b5\n[\nx1\u2212\u00b5\n]a+jw\na+(j\u22121)w\n(62)\n=\nC\n1\u2212 \u00b5\n[\n(a+ jw)1\u2212\u00b5 \u2212 (a+ (j \u2212 1)w)1\u2212\u00b5\n]\n(63)\n=\n(a+ (j \u2212 1)w)1\u2212\u00b5 \u2212 (a+ jw)1\u2212\u00b5\na1\u2212\u00b5 \u2212 b1\u2212\u00b5\n, (64)\nsubstitutingC to obtain (64). Note that\u2211J \u2032j=1 P(being in bin j|\u00b5) = 1, as required.\nThe log likelihood function, analogous to (15), is\nl(\u00b5|data) =\nJ\u2211\nj=1\ndj log [P(being in bin j|\u00b5)] (65)\n= \u2212n log(a1\u2212\u00b5 \u2212 b1\u2212\u00b5) +\nJ\u2211\nj=1\ndj log\n[\n(a + (j \u2212 1)w)1\u2212\u00b5 \u2212 (a+ jw)1\u2212\u00b5\n]\n,\n(66)\nwhich can be used to find MLEs and confidence intervals. The summation is taken\nto J instead of J \u2032 because dJ+1 = dJ+2 = ... = dJ \u2032 = 0. Therefore, an increase\nin b does not change the summation term in (66), but only changes the first term;\nthe first term is related to the normalization constant C. The likelihood function\n24\nfor the idealized infinite power-law tail can be derived using the same approach,\nand the resulting function is equivalent to taking the limit b\u2192\u221e in (66).\nSupplementary Methods 5.

Analysis of deer data\nFigures 3c and 3d of ref. 10 show log-log histograms of foraging times of deer, for\nunfenced and fenced scenarios. The data were digitized from ref. 27. In ref. 10 the\nforaging times were assumed to represent time intervals between the deer finding\nfood. However, the times actually represent time spent cropping and processing\nfood at a particular foraging site (pages 608 and 610 in ref. 27), i.e. handling times,\nrather than time spent moving between stations. Nevertheless we re-analyzed\nthe data in order to test the methods commonly used to demonstrate Le\u00b4vy flight\nbehaviour.\n26\nWe digitized the original histograms from ref. 27 to obtain the data. In the\nlog-log histograms in ref. 10 (our Fig. 4) these same values were plotted on a\nlog-log scale, with no lumping of the original bins. Thus the log-log histograms\nshow bins that are of equal width on a linear scale (namely a width of 20 s, as in\nthe original histograms in ref. 27). However, for the original wandering albatross\nstudy7, the log-log histograms had bins that progressively doubled in width. And\nfor the wandering albatross plot, the geometric means (midpoints on a log scale)\nof bins were plotted on the abscissa, whereas for the deer the midpoints on a linear\nscale were used. Our likelihood approach avoids these potential sources of error.\nFor both scenarios, the final bin of the original data was seemingly omitted\nin ref. 10. We do likewise, so that we perform our statistical studies on the same\ndata as used in ref. 10. Also, the lumping of bins means that bins of zero count in\nthe original data do not show up in any way on the log-log histograms (but they\ndo get considered in our likelihood approach).\nIn Figures 3c and 3d of ref. 10 (our Fig. 4), the straight lines representing\npower laws were drawn across all points excluding the first point (i.e. the tails were\nconsidered to be the second points onwards). Thus, for the ranges [a, b] needed for\nour likelihood analyses, we use the outside endpoints of these bins. Specifically,\n27\nfor the unfenced scenario we have [a, b] = [20, 180], and for the fenced scenario\n[a, b] = [20, 120].\nThe Le\u00b4vy flight hypothesis, as conventionally stated, relates to power-law\ntails with no mention of an upper limit (i.e. b \u2192 \u221e). We tested both data sets\nunder the assumption of no upper limit, and both sets gave p < 10\u22124 for the power\nlaw, and Akaike weights < 10\u22128 for the power law compared to the exponential.\nThus, a true Le\u00b4vy flight with an infinite tail is completely inconsistent with the\ndata.\nSupplementary Methods 7. Analysis of bumblebee data\nFigure 3a of ref. 10 shows two linear histograms of inter-flower distances flown\nby bumblebees. The data were digitized from ref. 28. One histogram is for a\nhigh-food scenario and the other is for a low-food scenario. In Fig. 3b of ref. 10\nthese data sets were plotted on a log-log histogram, and lines of slope \u00b5 \u2248 2 and\n\u00b5 \u2248 3.5 were shown to indicate power-law behaviour in the tails.\nTo obtain the data for our analyses, we digitized the original histograms\nfrom ref. 28 as well as the reproduced linear histograms from ref. 10, so that\n28\nwe could minimize any discrepancies due to digitization. Consider the low-food\ncase, namely the second diagrams in Fig. 3a of ref. 10 and Fig. 4 of ref. 28. The\noriginal bin width is w = 37.5, and the values plotted are percentages of the total\n352 flights. To obtain the counts we utilized this latter fact because each count\nmust be a multiple of 100\/352. (The units of distance were given in the original\nFig. 4 of ref. 28 as cm, but should actually be mm, as in Figures 1 and 2 of ref. 28;\nB. Heinrich, pers. comm. This does not affect our conclusions, or those of ref. 10).\nThe final bin in the tail of the original ref. 28 plot was omitted in the ref. 10 plot.\nWe do likewise as our interest is in comparing methods for evaluating power laws,\nand so wish to be consistent with the data used in ref. 10.\nFor the log-log histograms in ref. 10, the data were smoothed using running\naveraging and then lumped10 (but not in the manner described for the albatross\ndata in ref. 7). We note that a linear regression fit to the seven highest lumped\nbins for the low-food scenario gives a slope of \u00b5 = 2.33, larger than the value of\n2 shown in Fig. 3b of ref. 10. The likelihood approach presented here avoids any\nissues concerning the lumping of bins, and uses the original raw data as binned in\nref. 28.\nFor both food scenarios we need a range of [a, b] over which to test the\n29\npower-law and exponential models. We used the ranges implied by the straight\nlines drawn in Fig. 3b of ref. 10. For both scenarios we take a = 150, which\nis the only value that is consistent with being both a break point of the original\nbins of ref. 28, and with lying between the third and fourth lumped bins in Fig. 3b\nof ref. 10 (which is where the power-law lines are drawn to). For the high-food\nscenario we take b = 412.5 (the endpoint of the corresponding line on Fig. 3b\nof ref. 10), and for the low-food scenario we take b = 937.5, which is the right\nendpoint of the range of data included in the final lumped bin in Fig. 3b of ref. 10.\nThese values, as used in the main text, assume that the highest data recorded is the\nhighest data possible, and are the most favourable for the power law compared to\nthe exponential.\nIn Supplementary Table 1, for the high-food scenario, we show the effect\nof increasing b above the default value of 412.5, to allow for the (very likely)\npossibility that the true value of b will be larger than that based on the largest\nobserved data. This possibility is particularly likely to occur for power laws. We\nalso test the models under the idealized Le\u00b4vy flight assumption of an infinite tail\n(i.e. b\u2192\u221e). Supplementary Table 1 demonstrates that the computed MLE value\nfor \u00b5 is sensitive to b, and that neither model is strongly favoured for any value of\n30\nb, even for the idealized infinite situation.\nIn Supplementary Table 2 we test the sensitivity to b for the low-food sce-\nnario. Extending b to just one or two bins beyond the default shows that the mild\nsupport in favour of the power law (as given by the Akaike weights) is not robust\nto the value of b. For the idealized assumption of an infinite tail, the exponential\ndistribution is overwhelmingly favoured. In reality, the \u2018true\u2019 value of b in any\nsituation will lie somewhere between these extremes. This is a general issue that\nrequires further attention.\n31. Lawless, J. F.
