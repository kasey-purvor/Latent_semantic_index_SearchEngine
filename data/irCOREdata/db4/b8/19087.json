Such take-up provides well-documented\nbenefits for users who can now access the content\nthey need for study, teaching or research at any\ntime of the day or night. It has also meant that a\nquiet revolution has occurred within libraries in\nthe way that such access is managed. In an age\nwhere tens of thousands, if not hundreds of\nthousands, of individual electronic resources are\ndelivered by the library service and are available\nthrough multiple access points, it is no longer an\noption to manage these links manually. Such\nefforts lead to the failure of links when URLs\nchange and an inability to resource the effort\nneeded to add links to new content, update\nexisting links and remove those which are no\nlonger active. In addition, the difficulty in linking\nusers from an article citation to the version of the\nfull text that is appropriate to their institution\u2019s\nsubscription has led to much confusion and\ninefficiency. To address this \u2018appropriate copy\u2019\nproblem and (as an essential by-product) to reduce\nthe administration performed and duplicated by\nlibraries the world over, OpenURL and link\nresolvers were invented. \nFirstly, what is OpenURL technology and what\nis a knowledge base? Figure 1 illustrates the linking\nscenario. An article could be available through\nmultiple access points \u2013 via an aggregated database,\npublisher website, subscription agent gateway or\ninstitutional repository. A user affiliated with an\ninstitution may have access to the article through\ntwo of these access points. A link from the citation\n\u2013 perhaps in an abstracting and indexing (A&I)\nservice or from Google Scholar \u2013 should direct \nthe user to only those two access points: their\n\u2018appropriate copy\u2019. Such individual configuration\nwithin each A&I database (or \u2018source\u2019) is difficult if\nnot impossible to administer. In addition, library\nA-Z lists with links at journal level need to be\nmanually maintained for each access point available\nto the institution. This level of manual intervention\nis unsustainable and may result in poor service\ndelivery because staff resources are just not\navailable to support it. \nThe OpenURL (Z39.88)1 standard, developed by\nNISO in conjunction with its inventor, Herbert Van\nde Sompel and others, supplied a new schema for\nan OpenURL link to solve the \u2018appropriate copy\u2019\nproblem.

The corresponding\ntake-up of OpenURL compliance amongst content providers in response\nhas resulted in a global solution to the \u2018appropriate copy\u2019 problem.\nHowever, this solution is only effective if the knowledge base behind the\nlink resolver is up to date, accurate and comprehensive and this is a factor\nthat is often overlooked in establishing OpenURL compliance.This article\nexplores the importance of OpenURL and knowledge bases to the\ninformation community as a whole and provides an overview and update\nof the role that the KBART (Knowledge Bases and Related Tools) project\nhas to play in improving knowledge base metadata. SARAH PEARSON\nE-Resources & Serials \nCo-ordinator\nLibrary Services\nUniversity of Birmingham and\nCo-Chair KBART group\nSerials \u2013 23(2), July 2010 Sarah Pearson KBART \u2013 improving content\n151\nmetadata \u2013 describing the citation the user is\ncoming from \u2013 to an institutional link resolver. The\nlink resolver is populated with information about\ncontent that the institution has access to and\ndelivers back to the user the appropriate links. \nThe OpenURL query itself contains two elements:\nthe location of the link server for an institution\n(base URL) and the metadata string for that\ncontent (e.g. ISSN, journal title). The OpenURL\nlink resolver is using its knowledge base to match\nthese elements against available services and\nconstructs the links to direct the user to the desired\nwebsite. \nThis requires an institution to have a link\nresolver supported by a functioning knowledge\nbase that provides information about full text and\nother appropriate services available to that user.\nThe library sets up their link resolver \u2018base URL\u2019 as\na one-time task with each content provider and\nthen also \u2018localizes\u2019 the knowledge base so that \nthe active links are based on their institutional\nentitlements. \nFor content providers, there are two elements to\nachieving \u2018link resolver compliance\u2019 \u2013 the adoption\nof the OpenURL standard and the provision of\naccurate and timely metadata to link resolver\nknowledge bases. The former is now widespread\nwithin the information community (although not\nwithout its problems2 ). However, it is the latter\nthat is often forgotten in achieving OpenURL\ncompliance and still remains to be tackled effectively\nby the information community. The content\nprovider is responsible for ensuring the timely,\naccurate and comprehensive delivery of global\nmetadata describing their content that will then\nenable the link resolver vendor to populate the\nknowledge base with this data and the library to\nselect the \u2018appropriate copy\u2019 for their users from\nthe knowledge base. Ultimately, OpenURL com-\npliance is no good if a library cannot select the\nappropriate service in the knowledge base for their\nusers. The efficiency and effectiveness of OpenURL\nlinking requires the involvement of all parts of the\nsupply chain, from primary publishers, hosting\nservices and aggregators, through to link resolver\nvendors and libraries. \nWhy is this important? It matters to the entire\nsupply chain for electronic content because\nknowledge bases and OpenURL enable content\nlinking to be predictable and efficient regardless of\ndifferent institutional entitlements. By increasing\nvisibility and accuracy of links, users are more\nlikely to find the content and access it successfully,\nresulting in greater usage of electronic content.\nAny positive impact on content usage is more\nlikely to be translated into a favourable renewal\ndecision by the institution and consequent protec-\ntion of revenue for content providers. At a time\nFigure 1. OpenURL technology enables linking to knowledge bases in a number of ways\nwhen value for money and demonstration of that\nvalue is crucial, exposing holdings metadata to\nlink resolver knowledge bases alongside OpenURL\ncompliance is important for all in the supply chain\n\u2013 those publishing, working with, supplying,\nadministering and funding electronic content. \nLink resolver knowledge bases have become a\nhighly valued tool to libraries. They establish what\nthe users from that institution can access, both in\nterms of titles and of coverage years within that\ntitle. As the metadata within knowledge bases has\ngrown over time, so has the emphasis placed on\nmaintaining the accuracy and comprehensiveness\nof that metadata. Libraries invest very heavily in\nkeeping this knowledge base up to date as do the\nlink resolver vendors themselves. With the com-\nplexity of consortial and institutional entitlements,\nthe plethora of content packages and the emerging\ncomplexity associated with hybrid and open access\ncontent, this is no easy task. It is being recognized\nthat the whole supply chain has a role to play in\nkeeping knowledge bases accurate. In fact, the best\nway to achieve this is at source, by content\nproviders providing regular updates of holdings\nmetadata to knowledge bases. \nKnowledge bases are also becoming more\nimportant over time as a collection development\ntool. With the huge amount of information on con-\ntent provider holdings and the level of custom-\nization, link resolvers are uniquely placed to offer\ntools such as overlap and gap analysis between\ncurrent collections and potential acquisitions. It is\ntherefore becoming an important tool for reaching\nthe library market and consequently inaccurate\nmetadata can be detrimental to all stakeholders. \nAlthough the benefits start with the end-user,\nthey reach back right through the supply chain.\nHowever, despite a great deal of effort put in to\nkeeping knowledge bases accurate, there remains\nmuch work to be done. The duplication of effort\nrequired by many libraries is not sustainable and\ncontent linking will suffer. A lot of the work\ncurrently undertaken by libraries is reactive \u2013\nresponding to problems that have been reported. A\nfar better scenario is to proactively feed in changes\nto content metadata at the right time to enable\ntimely links to be set up to content. By establishing\nregular, frequent exchanges of metadata between\ncontent providers and link resolvers, this effort can\nbe minimized and the investment in good quality\ncontent linking assured. Without good practice\nrecommendations and ownership of the problem\nwithin the supply chain, users will continue to be\nconfused by dead links, out-of-date holdings\ninformation and lack of access to content to which\nthey are entitled. This is where KBART comes in. \nThe role of KBART in improving knowledge\nbase metadata\nThese issues are central to the work of the KBART\ngroup, an initiative of NISO (the US National\nInformation Standards Organization) and UKSG (a\nnon-profit organization that connects the inform-\nation community) that is exploring data problems\nwithin the OpenURL supply chain. \nThe KBART working group was set up in\nJanuary 2008 by the NISO and UKSG management\ncommittees with two chairs appointed: Peter\nMcCracken (for NISO) and Charlie Rapple (for\nUKSG). Its work is governed by the NISO Discovery\nto Delivery Topic Committee and the UKSG Main\nCommittee. This collaboration ensured that any\nresulting recommendations would have global\nreach to match the availability of publishing\noutput across borders. The work of KBART\nresponds to recommendations in a research report\ncommissioned by UKSG in 2007 and written by\nJames Culling of Scholarly Information Strategies.\nThe report entitled \u2018Link resolvers and the serials\nsupply chain\u20193 recommended that a \u2018code of\npractice\u2019 be produced on the methods and frequency\nof metadata transfer, along with the metadata\nelements required. Alongside this, education,\npromotion and communication activities should\nbe considered in order to promote adherence to the\ncode of practice. \nThe KBART working group consists of\npublishers, other content providers, link resolver\nsuppliers and libraries with expertise in the field \nof knowledge base metadata. The main areas of\nactivity were established as being best practice\nguidelines, educational materials and events, and a\nweb hub to act as a central resource for knowledge\nbase information. \nAlongside the main report and guidelines, a\nseries of other documents are available on the\nUKSG website. These include a glossary of terms,\nFAQs on OpenURL and knowledge bases, a\ndescription of supply chain roles and responsibilities\nfor metadata transfer and an entry-level descrip-\ntion of OpenURL technology. \nKBART \u2013 improving content Sarah Pearson Serials \u2013 23(2), July 2010\n152\nIn terms of the \u2019Recommended Practice\u2019 itself,\nthe various problems resulting from poor metadata\nin knowledge bases were analysed, with input\nfrom the information community at various events\nover the last two years. A list of priorities to be\naddressed was then developed:\n\u25a0 identifier inconsistencies\n\u25a0 title inconsistencies\n\u25a0 incorrect date coverage\n\u25a0 inconsistent date formatting\n\u25a0 inconsistencies in content coverage description\n\u25a0 embargo inconsistencies\n\u25a0 data format and exchange\n\u25a0 outdated holdings data\n\u25a0 lack of customization.\nMany of the priorities above are addressed in the\nphase I recommendations which were released in\nJanuary 2010. However, after much debate, the\nKBART working group took the decision to focus\non the more fundamental metadata issues, such \nas accuracy of global coverage description, before\nconcentrating on areas like consortial- and\ninstitution-specific metadata. This approach was\ntested with content providers prior to release of the\nRecommended Practice. This was highly valuable\nin demonstrating that even the core metadata, such\nas coverage and identifier information, is difficult\nto provide accurately and uniformly. The resulting\nlist of data elements within the KBART Recom-\nmended Practice is described in Table 1. \nThe recommendations also include the method\nand frequency of exchange, the data file format\nand naming convention along with descriptions of\nthe data field requirements. They are designed to be\nused both by content providers who have never sent\nmetadata to link resolvers before and by content\nproviders who are already doing so but can use this\nas a checklist to review their current procedures. \nNext steps\nA number of next steps have been identified in the\nKBART Recommended Practice. These include\nreviewing requirements for consortial- and\ninstitution-specific metadata and also non-journal\nmetadata. There has been considerable debate on\nmailing lists regarding the knowledge base metadata\nproblems associated with open access, hybrid and\nfree content. These are increasingly being activated\nby libraries alongside subscription content in order\nto provide a more comprehensive knowledge base\nfor users. KBART will be reviewing the require-\nments for best practice in this area.  \nAs recently publicized in a UKSG press release4,\nthe KBART group has established an endorsement\nframework around the Recommended Practice.\nThis is designed to allow content providers and\nlink resolvers to transition to the KBART format\nfor e-holdings metadata and publicize and celebrate\nadoption of good practice. There is also a contacts\nregistry where supply chain members can provide\ncontact details and links to metadata files. More\ninformation on endorsement can be found on the\nKBART Information Hub5.\nSerials \u2013 23(2), July 2010 Sarah Pearson KBART \u2013 improving content\n153\nTable 1.
