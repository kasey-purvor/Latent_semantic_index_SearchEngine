At certain flow regimes [1], the flow-geometry interaction occur-\nring in a cavity onsets large-scale self-excited instabilities that dominate the\naerodynamic flow field. In this field, the time-dependent pressure is oscilla-\ntory along the solid boundaries and generates time-dependent drag. Strong\ntonal noise is also generated by the aerodynamic instabilities. The physics of\nnoise production is based on Lighthill\u2019s acoustic analogy. This study addresses\nby numerical investigation the noise source characteristics based on the time-\naveraged Lighthill stress tensor distribution, derived from the time-dependent\naerodynamic results. This approach attempts to capture through the acoustic\nanalogy the aerodynamic noise sources responsible for the sound perceived\nin the acoustic far-field. This investigation complements the available litera-\nture on the aerodynamics and near-field acoustics of self-sustained open cavity\nflows [2\u20135], giving some further information on the source strength of the noise\nperceived at more than 20 cavity lengths away from the enclosure.\nZhang [6,7] discussed the flow unsteadiness developing over a cavity or enclo-\nsure. A turbulent boundary layer approaches the enclosure towards the up-\nstream edge (Fig. 1). At this location, the geometry induced flow separation\nforms a shear layer. The latter is unstable, developing large-scale self-sustained\ninstabilities that characterize the unsteady aerodynamic field. Aerodynamic\npressure fluctuations inside the enclosure accompany the observed shear layer\nunsteadiness and provide the feed-back for the onset of a stable self-sustained\noscillatory flow regime. The flow instability is responsible for wall pressure\n2\nfluctuations, pressure drag and aerodynamic noise radiation.\nIn this study, a rectangular enclosure of length to depth ratio 3 is tested\nat free stream Mach numbers (M\u221e) of 1.5 and 2.5. Measurements and past\nnumerical predictions by Zhang [6,7] are available for comparison. Charwat\net al. [8] identified a \u2018closed\u2019 flow regime where the shear layer reattaches to\nthe central section of the cavity floor, and an \u2018open\u2019 flow geometry where the\nreattachment point is the downstream edge. The flow geometry considered\nhere is \u2018open\u2019 and approximately two-dimensional (2-D).\nEven the simple geometry of a rectangular cavity develops a complex flow pat-\ntern that is the object of on-going fundamental research (e.g. Jeng & Payne [9]\nand Zhang et al. [10]). Practical applications of related cavity flows include\nslotted wall wind tunnels, slotted flumes, bellows-type pipe geometries, gate\nslots, spacecraft, and aircraft components. The subject is reviewed by Rock-\nwell & Naudascher [2], Blake & Powell [3], Colonius [4], Grace [11] and by\nRowley & Williams [12].\nIn the time-averaged flow, the presence of the shear layer and its rate of\ngrowth, the pressure distribution around the walls, the characteristics of the\nin-coming boundary layer and of the re-attached flow downstream of the cavity\nall influence the cavity mean drag. A quantitative prediction is attempted of\nthe salient time-averaged features to estimate the cavity mean drag.\nIn the time-dependent flow, a qualitative analysis is presented on the convec-\ntive amplification of the large-scale instability in the shear layer and of the\naccompanying unsteady convected vorticity. The flow-geometry interaction at\nthe downstream cavity edge dominates the pressure fluctuations throughout\nthe cavity. Past studies have used the knowledge of such interaction to reduce\n3\nthe unsteady aerodynamic loads of a model enclosure [13,14]. This study aims\nto relate such flow physics to the sources of the aerodynamic noise perceived\nin the acoustic far-field.\nAerodynamic noise is generated as a by-product of the flow instability. Cavity\nnoise measurements by Block [15] and numerical studies by Hardin & Pope [16]\nhighlighted the tonal characteristics of the radiated sound field at certain flow\nregimes. For the selected test cases the noise characteristic wavelength (\u03bb) is\ngreater than the cavity characteristic dimension (D). Flow-acoustic interaction\ninside the cavity is limited by the size of the enclosure (\u03bb < D) and hence the\nunsteady flow can be regarded as a compact noise source. In the acoustic\nfar-field, at a distance of 20 or more cavity lengths away from the enclosure,\nthe pressure fluctuation perceived by an observer as aerodynamic noise is the\nintegral effect of the Lighthill stress tensor field. This can be extracted from\nthe time-dependent aerodynamic predictions.\nThe present study focuses on the large-scale turbulent structure in the cavity\nresponsible for aerodynamic noise generation. Lighthill\u2019s acoustic analogy is\nfollowed to identify the acoustically active regions in the flow field. The physics\nof noise generation is addressed as a by-product of the time-dependent flow.\nThese results contribute to the understanding of cavity noise generation, which\nis the basis for developing successful noise control strategies.\n2 Flow Conditions\nThe geometry and flow conditions describe a longitudinal rectangular cavity\ndriven by a turbulent shear layer, studied in Zhang [6,7]. The depth of the\n4\ncavity D is 15mm and the length of the cavity L is 45mm. The geometry is\ntested at free stream Mach numbers (M\u221e) of 1.5 and 2.5. At M\u221e = 1.5 the free\nstream temperature (T\u221e), pressure (p\u221e), density (\u03c1\u221e), stagnation tempera-\nture (Ts) and stagnation pressure (ps) are 200K, 53.801kN\/m\n2, 0.9373kg\/m3,\n288.5K, and 197.51kN\/m2 respectively. At M\u221e = 2.5 the corresponding values\nare 128K, 17.390kN\/m2, 0.4701kg\/m3, 288.5K, and 297.12kN\/m2. A turbulent\nboundary layer approaches the enclosure upstream edge. The boundary layer\nthickness (\u03b4) and momentum thickness (\u03b42) are respectively 5mm, 0.417mm at\nM\u221e = 1.5, and 5mm and 1.290mm at M\u221e = 2.5. The flow Reynolds number\n(Re) based on the cavity depth is 4.5\u00d7 105 in both cases.\nNon-dimensional short-time averaged variables (\u02dc ) are used in the numerical\nmodel. The density (\u03c1), velocity vector (u), pressure (p), specific enthalpy\n(h), turbulent kinetic energy (k), temperature (T ), and dynamic viscosity (\u00b5)\nare normalized by the free stream conditions (\u03c1\u221e, U\u221e, T\u221e, \u00b5\u221e); the specific\nturbulent dissipation rate (\u03c9) by U\u221eRe\/D, and time by D\/U\u221e.\n3 Numerical Model\n3.1 Aerodynamic model\nA combined deterministic and stochastic approach is followed to model the\ncavity aerodynamic flow. The flow visualization by Zhang [6] in Fig. 9(a) indi-\ncates that the aerodynamic field can be regarded as large-scale time-evolving\nstructures in a background of random turbulence. These large-scale flow in-\nstabilities are obtained from the selective amplification of flow disturbances\nin the cavity. The excited modes are the eigenmodes of the cavity flow, as\n5\nshown by the analysis of Bilanin & Covert [17]. The enclosure geometry and\nthe inlet boundary layer profile are the boundary conditions that determine\nthe eigenmodes and, more generally, the frequency and wavenumber response\ncharacteristics of the cavity. The observed large-scale structures develop in the\nshear layer spanning the cavity open surface and are Kelvin-Helmoltz type\ninstabilities. They are therefore problem-specific and their initial growth is es-\nsentially a deterministic inviscid process. The large-scale instability growth can\nbe modelled by inviscid instability analysis methods as in Tam & Block [18],\nor by a time-dependent numerical solution of the Euler equations as in Zhang\n& Edwards [19] and Rona & Dieudonne\u00b4 [20].\nMeasurements by Zhang [6] show that the large-scale instabilities are gener-\nated at the cavity upstream edge. These are convectively amplified, impinging\nagainst the downstream edge within approximately one fundamental instabil-\nity mode wavelength (\u03bb) from their point of origin. During convection over\nthe cavity open surface, the small flow perturbations grow to a finite am-\nplitude and the modes saturate, displaying convective mode non-linearities.\nThe large-scale instabilities reach the downstream edge having covered just\none fundamental mode wavelength, which is unlikely to be sufficient to al-\nlow the dominant instability modes to decay in smaller eddies and establish\na fully developed turbulent flow. The large scale structure can still be read-\nily identified on the trailing edge plate in Zhang [6], at a streamise distance\ngreater than 6D from the upstream edge. The accompanying wall pressure\nmeasurements in Zhang [6] confirm a power spectral density dominated by\nlow frequency isolated tones over a lower amplitude broad-band turbulent\ncontribution, decaying with frequency. Further downstream, away from the\nenclosure, the convected instabilities are expected to decay, creating a tur-\n6\nbulent kinetic energy cascade to the higher wavenumbers and the turbulent\nkinetic energy is eventually dissipated by viscous stresses in the dissipation\nsub-range, at the Kolmogorov length scale. As the flow is supersonic, this\ndownstream flow regime does not significantly affect the upstream cavity.\nA separation of kinetic energy length scales approach is adopted to obtain a\nnumerical model of the cavity flow. The model exploits the modest energy\ntransfer (interaction) between the large-scale structure and the background\nof fine-scale turbulence in the selected cavity test cases. A time-dependent\nprediction of the large-scale structure is performed using an explicit time-\nmarching finite-volume method. In the numerical model, the grid size does not\nallow to resolve directly the small-scale structure in the dissipation sub-range\nand the Wilcox [21] k \u2212 \u03c9 two-equation model is used to provide turbulence\nclosure.\nThe large-scale structure fluctuations can be extracted from the flow history\nby averaging over a time that is short compared to the characteristic period\nof the large eddies in the flow field and long compared to the fluctuations\nof the small-scale turbulence. The instantaneous value of any flow variable\nf is thus split in a short-time averaged component f\u02dc and a fluctuation due\nto small-scale turbulence f \u2032\u2032, which is treated as a stochastic variable. This\nprocess is called short-time averaging. For simplicity, terms like \u02dc\u03c1\u2032\u2032T \u2032\u2032 are not\nmodelled, since, for instance, heat transfer effects mainly depend on the time-\nmean temperature gradient.\nFor steady flow problems, such as the compressible turbulent boundary layer\nflow of Mabey & Sawyer [22], the short-time averaged method is identical\nto an explicit Reynolds averaged method and converges to a steady state.\n7\nIn such fully developed turbulent flow, all kinetic energy length scales are\nmodelled by the k and \u03c9 equations. In the cavity flow, a continuous turbulent\nspectrum is not achieved at the downstream edge and the k\u2212\u03c9 model covers\na different role than in steady flow problems. First, it models the statistics\nof the downstream evolution of the fine-scale turbulence, generated by the\nupstream boundary layer. The wavenumber range of these flow features is\nabove the cavity eigenmodes range. Second, it augments the effects of laminar\nviscosity to control the saturation of the enclosure eigenmodes. In the time-\ndependent cavity model, the short-time velocity gradient is used to estimate\nthe turbulent stress tensor, while the mean velocity gradient would be used\nfor the Reynolds stresses in a time-mean approach. This attempts to filter the\nlarge-scale kinetic energy contribution in the small-scale turbulence model.\nConsider a compressible turbulent flow governed by the short-time averaged\nNavier-Stokes equations (Lilley et al. [23]) written in vector form. The turbu-\nlent stress tensor is estimated using the k\u2212\u03c9 two-equation model of Wilcox [21]:\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4\nU\u02dc +\u2207 \u00b7\n(\nF\u02dc i + F\u02dc t\n)\n+ S\u02dc = 0, (1)\nwhere\nU\u02dc =\n[\n\u03c1\u02dc, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dc, \u03c1\u02dc\n(\ne\u02dcs + k\u02dc\n)\n, \u03c1\u02dck\u02dc, \u03c1\u02dc\u03c9\u02dc\n]T\n,\nF\u02dc i =\n[\n\u03c1\u02dcu\u02dc, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcu\u02dc+ p\u02dcI, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dc\n(\nh\u02dcs + k\u02dc\n)\n, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dck\u02dc, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dc\u03c9\u02dc\n]T\n,\nF\u02dc t =\n[\n0,\u2212\n(\n\u03c4\u02dc + t\u02dc\n)\n,\u2212 (q\u02dc + q\u02dct)\u2212\n(\n\u03c4\u02dc + t\u02dc\n)\n\u00b7 u\u02dc\u2212 (\u00b5\u02dcl + \u03c3\u2217\u00b5\u02dct)\u2207k\u02dc\/Re,\n\u2212 (\u00b5\u02dcl + \u03c3\u2217\u00b5\u02dct)\u2207k\u02dc\/Re,\u2212 (\u00b5\u02dcl + \u03c3\u00b5\u02dct)\u2207\u03c9\u02dc\/Re\n]T\n,\nS\u02dc=\n[\n0, 0, 0, \u03b2\u2217\u03c1\u02dck\u02dc\u03c9\u02dcRe\u2212 t\u02dc : \u2207u\u02dc, \u03b2\u2217\u2217\u03c1\u02dc\u03c9\u02dc2Re\u2212 \u03b1\n(\n\u03c9\u02dc\/k\u02dc\n)\nt\u02dc : \u2207u\u02dc\n]T\n.

The turbulence closure coefficients (\u03b1, \u03b2\u2217, \u03b2\u2217\u2217, \u03c3, \u03c3\u2217) in the k \u2212 \u03c9\nmodel are modified for the effects of compressibility. The details can be found\nin Wilcox [21].\nA 160 \u00d7 200 rectangular grid defines the control volumes for the application\nof the conservation laws. A finer 320\u00d7 400 grid is also used to assess the grid\nsize effect on the aerodynamic predictions. The computational domain covers\na flow area of 12D and 5D in the streamwise and normal directions, the unit\ncell dimensions (\u2206y1,\u2206y2) are (0.075D, 0.025D) and (0.0375D, 0.0125D) for\nthe 160\u00d7 200 and 320\u00d7 400 grids respectively.\nThe Roe [24] flux difference split approximate Riemann method estimates the\n9\ninviscid fluxes\n(\nF\u02dc i\n)\nat the unit volume boundaries. The second-order space\naccurate extension is implemented. The MinMod inviscid flux limiter func-\ntion is adopted to preserve monotonicity. The inviscid flux components of\nthe k \u2212 \u03c9 equations are included as in Rona [25], following the same proce-\ndure of Roe. Second-order central difference is used to estimate the turbulent\nfluxes\n(\nF\u02dc t\n)\nthat are integrated with the inviscid ones in finite-volume form.\nThis compact integration strategy upgrades the operator split approach by\nZhang [7], enhancing the efficiency of the numerical quadrature in the model.\nA multi-step Runge-Kutta explicit time-marching method advances the flow\nprediction in time. Non-standard coefficients are used to enhance the scheme\nstability. These are b1 = 0.12, b1 = 0.25, b3 = 0.5, and b4 = 1.0. Specifically,\nan inviscid simulation is stable up to a Courant number (CFL = c\u02dc\u2206\u03c4\u02dc \/\u2206y) of\n2.0 (Manna [26]), while the same scheme with two-equation turbulence clo-\nsure was tested to be stable at CFL = 0.53. The method is second-order time\naccurate. The flow history is advanced with a 0.01 non-dimensional fixed time\nstep (\u2206\u03c4\u02dc) over which the flow is short-time averaged. At M\u221e = 1.5 this cor-\nresponds to CFL = 0.27 and CFL = 0.53 for the low and high density grids\nrespectively. At M\u221e = 2.5 the corresponding values are 0.16CFL and 0.32CFL.\nThe Nyquist Strouhal number [Str = fD\/U\u221e] is 100, which corresponds to a\n2.83MHz Nyquist frequency at M\u221e = 1.5 and 3.78MHz at M\u221e = 2.5.\nAt the inflow boundary (b1) the mass flux remains constant throughout the\ncomputation and is similar to the upstream boundary condition used by\nBastin [27] for the case of a supersonic uniform stream. In the unsteady cavity\nflow, upstream propagating disturbances are present in the boundary layer.\nThe upstream effect is limited below the sonic line to a distance less than one\nboundary layer thickness. This is difficult to quantify, but since the distur-\n10\nbances are damped while propagating from the upstream cavity edge (y1 = 0)\nto the inflow boundary (y1 = \u22123D), the selected boundary condition appears\nto be adequate (Rona [25]). Along the solid walls (b2\u2212 b6) a no-slip condition\nis imposed. At the outflow (b7) all conservative variables are extrapolated as-\nsuming constant gradients in space (first order extrapolation). Non-reflecting\nboundary conditions (Zhang [7]) apply on (b8). Along this latter computa-\ntional boundary, the flow is assumed uniform and parallel and the conserva-\ntive variables are set equal to their interior values and are constant along the\noutgoing Mach wave.\nThe flow state at the beginning of the computation is described in Fig. 2.\nThe inflow condition is imposed in the flow field above the cavity. Inside the\ncavity, stagnation temperature conditions apply and u = 0. As in Zhang [7],\nthe flow is perturbed over the cavity open end to facilitate the onset of the\nself-sustained unsteady flow regime. This is reached after \u03c4\u02dc \u223c O (50). The\ncomputation is then extended to \u03c4\u02dc \u223c O (150) to estimate the time-mean flow\nand monitor the aerodynamic pressure on the cavity walls. This corresponds\nto approximately 10 shear-layer oscillations at the fundamental mode. The\nwall pressure history is predicted at y1 = 0.33D and y1 = 2.33D on the floor\nof the enclosure, and at y1 = 3.66D and y1 = 5.66D above the downstream\ncavity edge. The sound pressure level at the enclosure walls and the cavity\nform drag are also estimated.\n3.2 Noise source prediction\nLighthill\u2019s acoustic analogy is used to determine the noise generation from\nthe predicted unsteady flow. The main contributions to the far-field acoustic\n11\nradiation are expected from the momentum flux fluctuations in the large-\nscale structure. The sources of noise can be found by short-time averaging the\nLighthill [28] governing equation for aerodynamic noise. This equation is\n22\u03c1\u02dc = \u2207 \u00b7 \u2207 \u00b7 T\u02dc , (11)\nwhere the tensor T\u02dc = \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcu\u02dc\u2212\n(\n\u03c4\u02dc + t\u02dc\n)\n+ (p\u02dc\u2212 c2\u221e\u03c1\u02dc) I is the short-time averaged\nLighthill stress tensor, t\u02dc = \u2212\u03c1\u02dcu\u02dc\u2032\u2032u\u2032\u2032 being the short-time averaged Reynolds\nstress tensor. This is derived following the procedure of Lighthill [28] from the\nshort-time averaged Navier-Stokes equations and is exact.\nThe above inhomogeneous wave equation separates the linear acoustic field in\nthe ambient medium at rest on the left hand side of the equation from the non-\nlinear acoustic sources arising from the unsteady flow. The solution procedure\nof Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings is used to integrate equation (11) over the\ncavity domain (Zhang et al. [10]). The acoustic density fluctuation perceived\nby an observer at x at time t due to a finite volume V (y) of unsteady flow\nemitting at the earlier time \u03c4 is\n\u03c1 (x, t) =\n1\n4pic2\u221e\n\u222b\nV\n\u2207 \u00b7 \u2207 \u00b7 T\u02dc (y, \u03c4) dV (y)\nR\u2217\n+\n1\n4pi\n\u222e\nS\n(\n\u2207\u03c1\u02dc+ \u03c1\u02dc\nR\n\u2207R + \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dc\nc\u221e\n\u2207R\n)\n\u00b7 ndS (y)\nR\u2217\n(12)\nwhere t = \u03c4 + R\/c\u221e is the retarded or reception time, R = |x\u2212 y| is the\ndistance source-observer and R\u2217 = |x\u2212 y| \u2212M\u221e \u00b7 (x\u2212 y) is the geometric\nscaling factor for acoustic propagation. The surface S bounds the flow domain\nV and n is its outward surface normal unit vector.\n12\nIn equation (12), R\u2217 accounts for the convection of the acoustic waves by a\nconstant Mach number M\u221e that approximately models the flow above the\nenclosure boundary layer for the purpose of acoustic convection. Other flow-\nacoustic interactions within the unsteady flow have not been modelled.\nThe volume integral in equation (12) operates on the second order Lighthill\nstress tensor differential that represents the aerodynamic sound sources from\nshearing flow. Specifically, noise is produced by momentum flux accelerations\nin the direction of the far-field observer at x. These acoustic quadrupoles were\nshown by Lighthill [28] to radiate with an acoustic intensity \u221d U8\u221e\/c5\u221e. The\nsurface integral term, evaluated along the cavity solid boundary, models the\ncontributions to noise by the aerodynamic flow interacting with the enclosure\nwalls. This first order differential term is a dipole noise source model that\nwas shown by Curle [29] to give an acoustic intensity \u221d U6\u221e\/c3\u221e. At subsonic\nspeeds, the dipole term would be expected to be the dominant contribution\nto noise. At the model flow regime, M\u221e > 1, the dipole and quadrupole type\ncontributions would be expected to be similar in magnitude and this study\nwill focus on the quadrupole type noise sources from T\u02dc .\nThe fluctuations in T\u02dc are estimated from the numerical database of the time-\ndependent cavity aerodynamic model. High values of the root-mean-square\nvalue of T\u02dc in the cavity flow identify the most acoustically active flow regions.\nEstimates of T\u02dc rms are performed between the onset of the self-sustained os-\ncillation and \u03c4\u02dc \u223c O (150).\n13\n4 Time Mean Flow\nAt M\u221e = 1.5, the main time averaged flow features are confined to the en-\nclosure and to its immediate surroundings. A complex shock containing flow\npattern develops above the enclosure (Fig. 3). The oblique shock above the\nupstream cavity edge forms a Mach angle (arcsin (1\/M\u221e)) with the stream-\nwise direction. There are no appreciable shock distortions or reflections close\nto the top computational boundary b8.\nAn unsteady shear layer forms downstream of the upstream cavity edge. Its\ntime averaged centreline position, defined as y2 at which u\u00af1 = 0.5, varies in\nthe streamwise direction. The time averaged density local minimum ahead of\nthe cavity downstream edge indicates the maximum in momentum transfer\nnormal to the cavity open top surface. At the cavity downstream edge, the\ncontour packing indicates mean flow impingement on the forward facing wall\nclose to y2 = 0.\nThe time averaged axial velocity contours in Fig. 4(a) and 4(b) indicate a\nvarying shear layer growth rate in the streamwise direction. Within 1D from\nthe upstream cavity edge the shear layer develops as a free shear layer. Further\ndownstream its growth rate is increased due to the presence of a stationary\nvortex at about y1 = 2D inside the cavity. The vortex streamwise location\nis indicated by the maximum in the back flow velocity (\u2212u\u00af1) close to the\ncavity floor. The presence of the solid walls limits the mass entrainment in\nthe sheared flow which is displaced outwards and the shear layer growth is\nreduced. The u\u00af1 = 0 contour starting at the upstream cavity edge re-attaches\non the downstream wall close to y2 = 0, indicating a stagnation point. The\n14\ntime averaged displacement thickness\n(\n\u03b4\u00af1\n)\nand momentum thickness\n(\n\u03b4\u00af2\n)\nof\nthe re-attached flow above the downstream cavity edge are about twice the\nupstream values of 0.857mm and 0.384mm. The result from using the 320\u00d7400\ncomputational mesh shown in Fig. 4(b) indicate that the time averaged flow\nprediction is almost grid independent.\nThe time averaged pressure on the upstream wall (Fig. 5) is predicted as a\nnearly constant value of p\u00afw \u223c 1.11p\u221e. On the cavity floor a local minimum is\nreached at about y1 = 2D, below the stationary vortex. The time averaged wall\npressure than increases monotonically towards the downstream bottom cavity\ncorner, where the fluid is nearly at rest (p\u00afw = 1.32p\u221e). On the downstream\nwall, p\u00afw has two maxima at y2 = \u22121.0D and y2 \u223c 0.0D, where the flow\nstagnates and p\u00afw = 1.32p\u221e at both locations.\nAt M\u221e = 2.5 a re-compression shock exists ahead of at the cavity downstream\nedge (Fig. 6). Its intensity is higher than at M\u221e = 1.5. The shear layer time\naveraged centreline position is more constant in the streamwise direction than\nat the lower Mach number. This suggests a more uniform shear layer growth up\nto y1 = 2D, which is confirmed by the time averaged axial velocity predictions\nin Fig. 7. The displacement and momentum thickness above the downstream\ncavity edge are approximately 1.5 times the upstream values of 1.353mm and\n0.332mm.\nThe time averaged pressure around the cavity perimeter in Fig. 8 shows a trend\nsimilar to the prediction at M\u221e = 1.5. The time averaged pressure maximum\nat the cavity downstream edge (stagnation point) is more pronounced, due\nto the higher free stream Mach number. Similar results are given in Jeng &\nPayne [9] and in Zhang et al. [14], showing similar levels of agreement with\n15\nthe experiments of Zhang [6].\nThe measured time averaged cavity pressure drag coefficients (CD) are 0.049\nand 0.037 at M\u221e = 1.5 and M\u221e = 2.5 respectively. The predicted values are\n0.055 and 0.030. The agreement is generally good.\n5 Unsteady Flow\n5.1 Self-excited instability\nThe unsteady open cavity flow at M\u221e = 1.5 is visualized in a selection of\nnumerical interferograms\/contours in Figs. 9(b) & (d). The phase-matched\nresult from holographic interferometry by Zhang [6] is given for comparison\nin Figs. 9(a) & (c).\nThe in-coming turbulent boundary layer separates at the upstream cavity\nedge, forming a free shear layer. This is responsive to the unsteady pressure\nand vorticity field inside the enclosure and develops Kelvin-Helmholtz type\ninstabilities. The unsteady modes saturate within a short distance from the\nupstream cavity edge and a rolled-up vortex is formed as shown in Figs. 9(a)\n& (b). The vortex is convected downstream by the shear flow.\nThe upstream cavity edge shock is unsteady and its location and strength are\naffected by the shear layer normal displacement beneath it [30]. When the\nshear layer is displaced in the positive normal direction, the shock is displaced\nupstream and has greater strength as shown in Figs. 9(c) & (d). Conversely\nthe shock strength decreases when the shear layer displaces towards the cavity\nfloor.\n16\nMass and momentum exchange between the free stream and the enclosed\nflow occurs across the open cavity top boundary. Unsteady mass ejection and\nentrainment at the downstream cavity edge are highlighted in Figs. 9(a) & (b)\nand Figs. 9(c) & (d) respectively. During the mass ejection phase, a vortex\nleaves the cavity and is convected downstream, parallel to the free stream.\nThe convected vorticity leaves the computational domain without producing\nnoticeable vorticity wave reflections in the subsonic section of the boundary\nlayer.\nThe interaction of the unsteady velocity and vorticity fields at the downstream\ncavity edge generates an excess unsteady pressure field within the cavity and\nacts on the shear layer at the upstream edge, exciting it and providing the\nfeed-back to maintain self-sustained flow oscillations. The numerical results\nindicate that the numerical model has captured this essential time-dependent\nfeature of the unsteady flow.\nAt M\u221e = 2.5 the shear layer flow-normal oscillation is the most prominent\nflow feature (Fig. 10). This drives the self-sustained flow instability. A complex\nshock pattern develops above the enclosure, which is dependent on the shear\nlayer vertical displacement. These transient compressible flow features can be\nexplained by analogy with a supersonic flow past a wavy wall. At M\u221e = 2.5\nthe dominant mode phase speed is approximately O (0.5U\u221e), therefore giving\na relative flow Mach number of approximately 1.25. Regions of shear layer\nmaximum concavity display compressive shocks with a (pi\/4) Mach angle,\nclose to the shear layer. This indicates a M\u02dc = 1.5 local Mach number. Ex-\npansion waves are generated above regions of shear layer maximum convexity.\nUnsteady mass entrainment and ejection occurs also at M\u221e = 2.5, the phase\nsequence in Figs. 9 and 10 being identical. Convected vortical structures are\n17\ngenerated at the downstream cavity edge by shear layer \u2018clipping\u2019 at the end\nof the mass ejection phase (Neary & Stephanoff [31]).\n5.2 Pressure fluctuation\nThe self-sustained characteristic of the flow instability is evident in the nor-\nmalized short-time averaged wall pressure history predictions (Figs. 11 and\n12). Self-sustained oscillations are obtained after a \u03c4\u02dc = 50 initial period dur-\ning which the starting transients are allowed to decay below the numerical\nnoise level. The instability is dominated by phase-locked cavity modes of con-\nstant amplitude. At M\u221e = 1.5 the pressure power spectral density measured\nat (2.33D,\u22121D) peaks at Strouhal numbers (Str) 0.093, 0.208 (dominant\nmode), and 0.323. At M\u221e = 2.5 the corresponding values are 0.092, 0.179,\nand 0.264 (dominant mode). At the same location, the predicted values are\n0.094, 0.192, and 0.369 at M\u221e = 1.5 and 0.090, 0.176, and 0.262 at M\u221e = 2.5.\nThe agreement is generally good.\nThe pressure history predicted by the numerical method at (0.33D,\u22121D),\n(2.33D,\u22121D), (5.66D, 0D), and (7.66D, 0D) indicates that the fluctuation of\nlargest amplitude occurs inside the enclosure in the neighbourhood of the sec-\nond transducer (2.33D,\u22121D), close to the downstream wall. A more accurate\nquantification of the unsteady pressure loading on the cavity perimeter is per-\nformed by estimating the sound pressure level (SPL) along the walls (Fig. 13).\nThe highest levels are predicted at the downstream cavity corner and edge\nand are \u223c 182dB re 20\u00b5Pa at M\u221e = 1.5. This is higher but still comparable\nwith 171.5 dB measured by Zhang [7] at (2.33D,\u22121D). At these locations,\nthe unsteady mass impingement and ejection results in alternating phases of\n18\nhigh speed flow past the edge and of shear flow stagnating on the downstream\nwall. At the downstream corner, the unsteady recirculation is responsible for\nthe predicted pressure unsteadiness. The downstream wall is clearly a region\nof significant flow unsteadiness in the cavity aerodynamic field. The shear flow\ninteraction with the geometry, resulting in the observed unsteady mass and\nmomentum exchange between the enclosure and the free stream, is the driving\nmechanism for the unsteady aerodynamic pressure field.\nA second SPL maximum of \u223c 178dB re 20\u00b5Pa is predicted at the upstream\ncavity edge. The fluctuation amplitude is adequate to locally excite the shear\nlayer, triggering convectively amplified modes at the observed Strouhal num-\nbers. The predicted unsteady aerodynamic pressure is therefore the link to\nclose the feed-back loop to maintain the self-excited flow instability. On the\nupstream bulkhead (y1 < 0) the upstream propagating disturbances are con-\nfined to the boundary layer, below the sonic line. Consequently, the wall pres-\nsure fluctuation is damped in the upstream direction, its magnitude being\nreduced below 120dB re 20\u00b5Pa by y1 \u223c \u22120.6D. At M\u221e = 2.5 the numerical\nmethod predicts the same trend for wall SPL as at the lower Mach number,\nthe fluctuation amplitude being O (10dB re 20\u00b5Pa) lower throughout. These\nresults are in general agreement with the numerical predictions by Jeng &\nPayne [9].\n5.3 Aerodynamic noise sources\nThe physics of aerodynamic noise production from compressible turbulent non-\nuniform flows is complex. In this study, some characteristics of this process\nare disclosed, which relate to the large-scale flow instability.\n19\nThe unsteady pressure predictions highlight the flow region at the downstream\ncavity edge as potentially the most unsteady. The accelerating fluid in the\ndirection of the observer produces aerodynamic sound, as described by the\napplication of the Lighthill solution by Proudman [32]. Estimating the root-\nmean-square of the streamwise and normal flow velocities therefore gives some\ndescription of the noise production physics at the downstream cavity edge.\nThe prediction at M\u221e = 1.5 in Fig. 14(a) shows that (u\u02dc1)rms, normalized as\nin Section 2, is maximum at the downstream cavity edge and is 0.272. The\nregion of maximum (u\u02dc1)rms extends mainly in the streamwise direction. This\nsuggests that a noise source of streamwise longitudinal and lateral quadrupole\ntype is present at this location in the aerodynamic field. A second localized\n(u\u02dc1)rms maximum is located at the upstream edge.\nThe root-mean-square normal velocity near-field is mainly related to the shear\nlayer normal displacement. Two regions of maximum (u\u02dc2)rms are shown in\nFig. 14(b) along the y2 = 0 line at approximately 0.5D and 2D from the\nupstream edge. The region closest to the upstream edge is where a vortex\nis periodically rolled up. This region is localized and (u\u02dc2)rms decays rapidly\nwith distance from its point of maximum value. The other region occurs where\nthe shear layer normal displacement is maximum. These indicate that noise\nsources of the normal longitudinal quadrupole type are present at (0.5D, 0D)\nand (2D, 0D) in the aerodynamic field. Their strength are expected to be\nless then the streamwise longitudinal quadrupole sources, since the associated\n(u\u02dc2)rms maximum is 0.175.\nThe unsteadiness in the M\u221e = 2.5 flow (Fig. 15) is proportionally lower than\nat M\u221e = 1.5, as also indicated by the SPL predictions in Section 5.2. At the\n20\nhigher Mach number, a (u\u02dc1)rms maximum of 0.223 is located at approximately\ny1 = 2D on the y2 = 0 line. The surrounding region of high (u\u02dc1)rms is elongated\nin the streamwise direction and results from the combined effect of the periodic\nshear layer oscillation and of a normal velocity gradient being present across\nthe shear layer. A localized maximum is also visible above the downstream\nedge and is related to the shear layer clipping and periodic vortex shedding.\nThe (u\u02dc2)rms contours also indicate a maximum at this location, highlighting\nthis region as an important noise source also at M\u221e = 2.5.\nThe time averaged characteristics of the aerodynamic noise source near-field\nare now considered. The short-time root-mean-square Lighthill stress tensor(\nT\u02dc rms\n)\nis estimated in the computational domain (Figs. 16 and 17).\nAt both Mach numbers, the contributions from T\u02dc11 to far-field cavity noise\nare dominant, which is what would be expected from a predominantly lon-\ngitudinal oscillation. According to Pierce [33], this streamwise longitudinal\nquadrupole type noise source is expected to give a cos2 \u03b8 far-field directivity\npattern, modified by the effects of source convection. The highest values occur\nclose to the downstream cavity edge, in agreement with the (u\u02dc1)rms predic-\ntions. The nature of this noise source is also confirmed, this being a momentum\nflux fluctuation (\u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcu\u02dc) in the direction of the observer. The physical process\ngenerating such fluctuation is associated with the periodic mass entrainment\nand ejection occurring at this location. Another area of high\n(\nT\u02dc11\n)\nrms\nis near\nthe upstream cavity edge and is probably associated to the fluctuations in mo-\nmentum flux during the vortex roll up. The fluid flow entrainment increases\nthe shear layer thickness, producing a localized\n(\nT\u02dc11\n)\nrms\n.\nThe lateral quadrupole type source contribution to the far-field noise is gen-\n21\nerated in the shear layer (Figs. 16(b) and 17(b)). At M\u221e = 1.5, the maximum(\nT\u02dc12\n)\nrms\nis 0.130. This is located close to the upstream cavity edge where a lo-\ncalized large (u\u02dc2)rms was identified in Fig. 14(b). Here the fluctuations in fluid\nmomentum flux are driven by the unsteady vorticity field which is character-\nized by vortex roll up. The convected vortex generates a moving bow shock\nabove the cavity the intensity of which decreases in the streamwise direction,\nwhile the shear layer thickens. This limits the area of high\n(\nT\u02dc12\n)\nrms\nto the\ninitial portion of the shear layer, 0D \u2264 y1 \u2264 1D. At M\u221e = 2.5, the observed\ninstability mode does not involve regular vortex shedding from the upstream\ncavity edge and a region of high\n(\nT\u02dc12\n)\nrms\nis where the shear layer displace-\nment is maximum. The interaction between the unsteady shear layer and the\ndownstream cavity edge is responsible for the localized\n(\nT\u02dc12\n)\nrms\nmaximum.\nMinor contributions to far-field noise are from aeroacoustic sources of the\ntransverse longitudinal quadrupole type, as shown in Figs. 16(c) and 17(c).\nThese are generated by the unsteady flow in the neighbourhood of the nor-\nmal downstream cavity wall where fluid is periodically accelerated into the\nclockwise cavity flow recirculation.\nAll regions of high\n(\nT\u02dc rms\n)\nare located inside the cavity or in its immediate\nsurroundings, clear from all open flow boundaries (Figs. 16 and 17). Around\nthe open flow boundary perimeter,\n(\nT\u02dc rms\n)\nis largest in the subsonic part of\nthe boundary layer at the outflow, where convected vortices leave the com-\nputational domain. At M\u221e = 1.5, the average\n(\nT\u02dc11\n)\nrms\nacross the boundary\nlayer is 0.06 of the near-field maximum. At M\u221e = 2.5, it is 0.03. Similar re-\nsults are produced for the lateral and normal longitudinal quadrupole source\nfields. This confirms that the computational domain size selected for this study\ncovers the most acoustically active flow regions for the selected test cases.\n22\n6 Conclusions\nA numerical investigation was performed on the time-mean and time-dependent\ncharacteristics of supersonic open cavity flows at M\u221e = 1.5 and M\u221e = 2.5.\nAn enhanced computational fluid dynamic method was adopted to further the\nanalysis by Zhang [7] and address cavity noise generation.\nThe time-mean flow predictions highlighted the importance of the stationary\nvortex at y1 \u223c 2D inside the cavity in determining the drag coefficient. The low\npressure in the vortex core displaces the shear layer towards the enclosure half-\ndepth, entraining mass and momentum and increasing the time-mean shear\nlayer thickness. The entrained momentum is responsible for the time-mean\nhigh pressure on the downstream wall, giving positive time-mean drag. The\nwall pressure distribution was found in good agreement with measurements at\nboth Mach numbers. Zhang et al. [13] show that significant reductions in CD\ncan be achieved when the downstream cavity corner is modified by a ramp\nand the stationary vortex is suppressed.\nThe time-mean growth rate of the shear layer and its normal displacement\nalong the cavity open boundary vary in the streamwise direction, leading to\na complex wave pattern above the enclosure. These time-mean streamwise\nshear layer oscillations might lead to a variable phase velocity and convective\nnon-linearities in the downstream propagating instability modes, affecting the\ndominant mode Strouhal number and its kinetic energy transfer to higher\nharmonics. Further analysis is required on this topic.\nOn time-dependent flow, the model reproduces the essential physics of the\nlarge-scale structure observed in experiment. At M\u221e = 1.5, self-sustained\n23\nshear layer oscillations combine with periodic vortex shedding from the cavity\nleading edge. The interaction of the convected instabilities with the down-\nstream cavity corner results in alternating phases of localized mass impinge-\nment and ejection that are visualized in the compressible flow. At M\u221e = 2.5,\nvortex free shear layer oscillations are predicted, in agreement with experi-\nment.\nAn unsteady aerodynamic pressure field in the cavity is predicted in the nu-\nmerical simulation. The physical mechanism generating aerodynamic pressure\nfluctuations is addressed and the downstream cavity edge is identified as a crit-\nical area of aerodynamic pressure and flow instability. The predicted SPL at\nthis location is \u223c 182dB re 20\u00b5Pa at M\u221e = 1.5. This is the highest level of un-\nsteady aerodynamic pressure loading predicted around the enclosure perimeter\nand it could represent a design constraint in practical engineering applications.\nAt the upstream cavity edge, the unsteady pressure perturbs the shear layer,\nclosing the feed-back loop for phase-locked self-sustained oscillations. Here\nthe predicted SPL \u223c 178dB re 20\u00b5Pa at M\u221e = 1.5 is of the right order of\nmagnitude to provide such interaction between the aerodynamic pressure field\nand the shear flow.\nThe aeroacoustic investigation focused on (i) the location and quantification\nof the sources of aerodynamic noise in the cavity flow and (ii) addressing the\nphysics of noise production to improve its current understanding towards its\nsuppression.\nThe cavity flow was found to be an acoustically compact source in that all\nregions of large contributions to the acoustic radiation are located inside the\nenclosure or in its immediate surroundings. The unsteady shear layer plays\n24\na dominant role in the acoustic radiation: the momentum flux fluctuation\ndue to the self-sustained instability is the dominant cavity noise generating\nmechanism. Longitudinal quadrupole type sources were predicted along the\nshear layer which reflect the aerodynamic fluctuation being predominantly of\nthe longitudinal type.\nAreas of high acoustic source strength\n(\nT\u02dc rms\n)\nare the neighbourhood of the\ncavity edges. The vortex roll up near the upstream edge and the unsteady mass\nexchange near the downstream edge provide the fluctuations in momentum\nflux for noise generation. Thus, modifications to the edge geometry could\nprove effective to reduce both cavity drag and the radiated noise.\n7 Acknowledgements\nThe author wishes to thank Prof. X. Zhang and Prof. G. M.
