His estate, called Dehesa del Carrascal de Sanchiricones, was \nlocated between Vecinos and Matilla de los Ca\u00f1os, two villages respectively thirty and thirty-\nfive kilometres to the south-west of Salamanca.  Although his atrocity was extreme, the \nsentiments behind it were not unrepresentative of the hatreds that had smouldered in the \nSpanish countryside over the previous years.  Aguilera\u2019s cold and calculated violence \nreflected an attitude common among the big landowners of the latifundio regions of Spain.  \nThe violent social conflicts of the period from 1918 to 1921, known as the trienio \nbolchevique, had been crushed by military repression but the consequent hatreds continued to \nsmoulder on both sides.  Previously, there had been an uneasy truce in which the wretched \nlives of the landless peasants were occasionally relieved by the patronising gestures of the \nowners \u2013 a blind eye turned to rabbit poaching and the gathering of wind-fall crops or even \nthe gift of food.  The violence of the trienio had outraged the landlords who could not forgive \nthe insubordination of braceros whom they considered to be almost sub-human.  Accordingly, \nthe paternalism which had somewhat mitigated the daily brutality of the day-labourers\u2019 lives \ncame to an abrupt end.   \n \nAfter April 1931, the Second Republic\u2019s attempts at agrarian reform saw the \nlandowners engaging in rural lock-outs and telling the hungry landless peasants to comed \nRep\u00fablica (literally \u2018eat the Republic\u2019, or \u2018let the Republic feed you\u2019).  The gathering of \nacorns, normally kept for pigs, or of windfall olives, the watering of beasts, or even the \ngathering of firewood were denounced as 'collective kleptomania'.2  Hungry peasants caught \ndoing such things were likely to be given savage beatings by the Civil Guard or armed estate \nguards.3  In fact, in the latifundio areas of southern Spain, Republican legislation governing \nlabour issues in the countryside was systematically flouted; unionised labour was \u2018locked-out\u2019 \neither by land being left uncultivated or simply refused work; starvation wages were paid to \nthose who were hired.  In words of the newspaper of the principal rural union, the Socialist \n                                                 \n1 Peter Kemp, Mine Were of Trouble (London: Cassell, 1957) p.50. \n2 La Ma\u00f1ana (Jaen), 16 January 1934. \n3 La Ma\u00f1ana (Jaen), 1 October 1932, 21, 27 January, 3, 18 February, 5 April 1933; El Adelanto (Salamanca), \n19 October 1932; Regi\u00f3n (C\u00e1ceres), 24 February 1933; El Obrero de la Tierra, 14 January, 4 March 1933, 6, 13, \n20 January, 17 February  1934; El Socialista, 21 January, 20 April, 1 July 1933.

Who sows the wind\u2026  By the handful, in Spain the seeds of tragedy are \nbeing thrown into the wind.  Let no one be surprised, let no one complain, let no one be \nscandalised and protest tomorrow, if these winds provoke a storm of blood.\u20194 \n \nAfter the fall of the Republican-Socialist coalition in the autumn of 1933, the \nlandowners had returned to the semi-feudal relations of dependence that had been the norm \nbefore 1931.  Consistent infractions of labour legislation led eventually to the FNTT calling a \nnational harvest strike in the summer of 1934.  The procedures for the strike to be legal had \nbeen meticulously observed by the union leadership.  However, the Minister of the Interior, \nRafael Salazar Alonso, a representative of the landowners of one of the most conflictive \nprovinces, Badajoz, saw an opportunity to smash the FNTT.  He declared the harvest a \nnational public service which effectively militarised the land-workers.  Strikers were arrested \nby the thousands and imprisoned hundreds of miles from their homes.  The harvest was \nbrought in by machinery and cheap labour from Portugal and Galicia.   The FNTT had been \ncrippled, union members were harassed by the Civil Guard, and estate security was tightened \nto prevent hunger being alleviated by poaching or the theft of crops.  The south was badly hit \nby drought in 1935, unemployment rose to more than 40% in some places and beggars \nthronged the streets of the towns.  Hatred smouldered.  Living in close proximity, the hungry \nand the well-to-do rural middle and upper classes regarded each other with fear and \nresentment.  Hatreds were intensified during the right-wing campaign for the elections of \nFebruary 1936 which prophesied that left-wing victory would mean \u2018uncontrolled looting and \nthe common ownership of women\u2019.  Even without such apocalyptic provocation, natural \ndisaster intensified social tension.  After the prolonged drought of 1935, early 1936 brought \nfierce rainstorms which ruined the olive harvest and damaged wheat and barley crops.  Left-\nwing victory in the elections coincided with even higher unemployment.  The local middle \nclasses were appalled by signs of popular jubilation, the flying of red flags and attacks on \nlandowners\u2019 clubs (casinos).  Labour legislation began to be reinforced and workers were \n\u2018placed\u2019 (alojados) on uncultivated estates.  Landowners were infuriated by evidence that \npeasant submissiveness was at an end.  Those that they expected to be servile were assertively \ndemonstrating that they were no longer prepared to be cheated out of reform.  The shift in the \n                                                 \n4 El Obrero de la Tierra, 24 March 1934. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           3 \nbalance of power provoked the anger and the fear of the latifundistas.  Many of them joined, \nfinanced or expectantly awaited news of the military plot to overthrow the Republic.  Even \nbefore 18 July, the situation in latifundio Spain had reached breaking point.5 \n \nWhen the Civil War began, in latifundio areas of the Republican zone, repressive \nlandlords were in serious danger of their lives from the landless labourers.  Aguilera, like \nothers, perceived himself to be taking retaliatory measures in advance.  Many landowners \njoined the uprising, accompanied Franco\u2019s columns and played an active role in selecting \nvictims to be executed in captured villages.   Their influence was reflected in the fact that, \nwhen peasants were shot, they were made to dig their own graves first, and Falangist \nse\u00f1oritos shouted at them \u2018(Didn\u2019t you ask for a plot of land.  Now you\u2019re going to have one, \nand for ever!\u2019 (\u00bfNo ped\u00edais tierra?  Pues la vais a tener; \u00a1y para siempre!).6   The hatred of the \nlandowners for the rural proletariat found an appropriate instrument in Franco\u2019s African \ncolumns.  Explicit parallels were drawn at the time between the left in mainland Spain and the \nRiff tribesmen; the \u2018crimes\u2019 of the reds in resisting the military uprising seen as identical with \nthe \u2018crimes\u2019 of the tribesmen who massacred Spanish troops at Annual in 1921.  The role of \nthe African columns in 1936 was seen as the same as that of the Regulares and Legionaries \nwho relieved Melilla in 1921.7  As they moved north from Seville in early August, they used \nthe techniques of terror which had been their regular practice against the subject population of \nMorocco.   Word of their tactics spread a wave of fear before them and villages and towns in \nthe provinces of Seville and Badajoz, El Real de la Jara, Monesterio, Llerena, Zafra, Los \nSantos de Maimona, easily fell before them.  In addition to looting, they annihilated any \nleftists or supposed Popular Front sympathisers that they found, leaving a trail of bloody \nslaughter as they went.  The execution of captured peasant militiamen was jokingly referred to \nas 'giving them agrarian reform'.  After the capture of Almendralejo, one thousand prisoners \nwere shot including one hundred women.8   After the shootings, the remaining women were \nraped.   \n                                                 \n5 Preston, The Coming of the Spanish Civil War, pp.147-53, 245, 259-60; Paul Preston, \u2018The Agrarian War in \nthe South\u2019 in Paul Preston, Editor, Revolution and War in Spain 1931-1939 (London: Methuen, 1984) pp.159-\n81. \n6 Alfonso Lazo, Retrato de fascismo rural en Sevilla (Sevilla: Universidad de Sevilla, 1998) pp.11-14; \nMargarita Nelken, Las torres del Kremlin (M\u00e9xico D.F.: Industrial y Distribuidora, 1943) p.259. \n7 Manuel S\u00e1nchez del Arco, 2\u00aa edici\u00f3n El sur de Espa\u00f1a en la reconquista de Madrid (Seville: Editorial \nSevillana, 1937) pp.18-20. \n8 Carlos Asensio Cabanillas, 'El avance sobre Madrid y operaciones en el frente del centro', La guerra de \nliberaci\u00f3n nacional (Zaragoza: Universidad de Zaragoza, 1961) pp.160-5; Servicio Hist\u00f3rico Militar (Jos\u00e9 \nManuel Mart\u00ednez Bande), La marcha sobre Madrid (Madrid: Editorial San Mart\u00edn, 1968) pp.24-34; S\u00e1nchez del \nArco, El sur de Espa\u00f1a, pp.62-81; Juan Jos\u00e9 Calleja, Yag\u00fce, un coraz\u00f3n al rojo (Barcelona: Editorial Juventud, \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           4 \n \nThe deliberate savagery constituted what one scholar has called \u2018didactismo por el \nterror\u2019 (education through terror).  The aim was literally to bury for once and for all the \naspiration of the landless peasants to collectivise the great estates.  Using the excuse of the \n\u2018red terror\u2019, a vengeful bloodbath was unleashed by the rebel columns.  These consisted either \nof the African columns heading for Madrid under the overall command of General Franco or \nthose sent out from Seville by the \u2018viceroy of Andalusia\u2019, General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano.  \nIn most places, \u2018the red terror\u2019 was a feeble excuse.  In a wealthy farming community, \nCantillana (Seville), where there had been no history of social tension, Queipo de Llano\u2019s \nforces appeared in the early hours of the morning of 26 July.  In the course of the following \nthree days, two hundred people were killed.  In Carmona (Seville), for instance, there were \ntwo deaths under the Popular Front, which were revenged with the murder of 700.  The \nowners\u2019 view that their labourers were on a par with their livestock was illustrated in Castro \ndel R\u00edo, where day labourers were slaughtered using the same technique as that employed \nwith cattle.9  In Lora del R\u00edo, the Civil Guard, the priest and the local right-wingers had \ngreeted the news of the military uprising by taking arms and creating a stronghold in the town \nchurch.  It was quickly captured and they were all released except the notoriously brutal \ncacique.  In revenge for his execution, a simulacrum of a trial was mounted in which the judge \nwas a landowner and artillery reserve captain, who, according to an eye-witness, had \npretensions to nobility equalled only by his ignorance and brutality.  Three hundred labourers, \nincluding some women, were \u2018tried\u2019 en masse without defence.  The crimes of which they \nwere accused ranged from having flown a Republican flag from their balcony to having been \nheard expressing admiration for Roosevelt.  Domestic servants were accused of having \ncriticised their employers.  All were found guilty and shot.  The executions were followed by \na great orgy with drink provided by grateful wine-producers.  Advantage was taken of the \ntown\u2019s many recent widows to meet \u2018the sexual excesses of that collectivity without women\u2019 \n(the occupying African columns).10 \n                                                                                                                                                        \n1963) pp.90-1, 94-6; Jes\u00fas Salas Larrazabal, La guerra de Espa\u00f1a desde el aire 2\u00aa edici\u00f3n (Barcelona: Ariel, \n1972) p.64; Herbert Rutledge Southworth, Le mythe de la croisade de Franco (Paris: Ediciones Ruedo Ib\u00e9rico, \n1964) p.215; Francisco Moreno G\u00f3mez. \u2018La represi\u00f3n en la Espa\u00f1a campesina\u2019 in Jos\u00e9 Luis Garc\u00eda Delgado, \neditor, El primer franquismo: Espa\u00f1a durante la segunda guerra mundial (Madrid: Siglo XXI, 1989) p.192. \n9 Antonio-Miguel Bernal, \u2018Resignaci\u00f3n de los campesinos andaluces: la resistencia pasiva durante el \nfranquismo\u2019, in Isidro S\u00e1nchez, Manuel Ortiz, & David Ruiz, editors, Espa\u00f1a franquista.

Already, in the spring \nof 1936, when the rising was being prepared, General Emilio Mola, its director, and until \nrecently, the commander-in-chief of the African Army, drew up a series of secret instructions. \nThey summed up the extent to which the Army felt no sense of being the body whose job it \nwas to protect the Spanish people from an external enemy.  The Spanish proletariat was \nclearly \u2018the enemy\u2019.  In that sense, the mentality of the Africanista high command reflected \none of the major consequences of the colonial disaster of 1898.  This was simply that the right \ncoped with the loss of a \u2018real\u2019 overseas empire by internalising the empire, that is to say, by \nregarding metropolitan Spain as the empire and the proletariat as the subject colonial race.  \nThe first of Mola\u2019s secret instructions, issued in April, declared \u2018Se tendr\u00e1 en cuenta que la \nacci\u00f3n ha de ser en extremo violenta, para reducir lo antes posible al enemigo, que es fuerte y \nbien organizado.  Desde luego, ser\u00e1n encarcelados todos los directivos de los partidos \npol\u00edticos, sociedades o sindicatos no afectos al Movimiento, aplic\u00e1ndose castigos ejemplares a \ndichos individuos, para estrangular los moviminetos de rebeld\u00eda o huelgas.\u2019  (\u2018It has to be \nborn in mind that the action has to be violent in the extreme to reduce as soon as possible the \nenemy which is strong and well-organized.  Of course, all leaders of political parties, societies \nand trade unions which are not linked to the movement will be imprisoned and exemplary \npunishment carried out on them in order to strangle any rebellion or strikes.\u2019)11  In his \nproclamation of martial law in Pamplona on 19 July 1936, Mola said \u2018Restablecimiento del \nprincipio de autoridad exige inexcusablemente que los castigos sean ejemplares, por la \nseriedad con se impondr\u00e1n y la rapidez con que se llevar\u00e1n a cabo, sin titubeos ni \nvacilaciones.\u2019 (\u2018Re-establishing the principle of authority unavoidably demands that \npunishments be exemplary both in terms of the severity with which they will be imposed and \nthe speed with which they will be carried out.\u2019)12   Shortly afterwards, he called a meeting of \nall of the alcaldes (mayors) of the province of Pamplona and told them: \u2018Hay que sembrar el \nterror\u2026 hay que dar la sensaci\u00f3n de dominio eliminando sin escr\u00fapulos ni vacilaci\u00f3n a todos \nlos que no piensen como nosotros.

If we vacillate \none moment and fail to proceed with the greatest determination, we will not win.  Anyone \nwho helps or hides a communist or a supporter of the Popular Front will be shot.\u2019)13 \n \nThe savagery visited upon the towns conquered by Spanish colonial forces was simply \na repetition of what they did when they attacked a Moroccan village.   In a broadcast on 24 \nJuly, Queipo de Llano commented \u2018Al Arahal fu\u00e9 enviada una columna formada por \nelementos del Tercio y Regulares, que han hecho all\u00ed una razzia espantosa, sancionando con \nejemplares castigos los excesos salvajes inconcebibles que se han cometido en aquel pueblo\u2019 \n(\u2018a column made up of elements of the Legion and the Regulares was sent to El Arahal where \nthey carried out a terrifying razzia, responding with exemplary punishments to the \nunimaginably savage excesses that have been committed in that village\u2019 and threatening that \nsimilar razzias would be carried out in surrounding towns.  Queipo\u2019s broadcast merely \ntouched upon the bare bones of a complex story.  When news of the military rebellion reached \nEl Arahal, a small town of 12,000 inhabitants, the local right-wingers who supported the \nrising had been locked up in the town hall.  On 22 July, when a Socialist town councillor tried \nto release them, some left and twenty three remained fearful that it was a ruse to shoot them.  \nSome armed men from Seville then set fire to the building and twenty three died.  When \nQueipo\u2019s Nationalist column entered El Arahal, they reacted to what they had found with an \norgy of indiscriminate violence.  They killed one thousand, six hundred of the town\u2019s \ninhabitants as well as repeatedly raping young women considered to be of the left.14   \n \nThe latifundio system, which was the dominant mode of landholding in Andalusia, \nExtremadura and Salamanca, made it easier for the owners to think of the bracero as \nsubhuman, a piece of property and a \u2018thing\u2019 to be punished or annihilated for daring to rebel.  \nTo the owners, the entire experience of the Second Republic constituted a \u2018rebellion\u2019. The \ncontiguity of Africa and Andalucia ensured that the prejudices of the southern landowners \nwere implemented by Africanistas trained in murdering innocent civilians.  The symbiosis \nbetween latifundistas and Africanistas was illustrated frequently in the early weeks of the civil \n                                                 \n13 Juan de Iturralde, La guerra de Franco, los vascos y la Iglesia 2 vols (San Sebasti\u00e1n: Publicaciones del Clero \nVasco, 1978) I, p.433.

In the province of Cordoba, for instance, the cacique of Palma del R\u00edo, Don F\u00e9lix \nMoreno, bred fighting bulls which limited the amount of work on his estates.  He refused to \ncultivate his land, using the slogan \u2018Comed Rep\u00fablica\u2019 (let the Republic feed you).  When the \nlabourers demonstrated against him, he had shot one of them. Before the Civil War, F\u00e9lix \nMoreno fled to his palace in Seville.  When war broke out, the village was collectivised and \nfood supplies rationed until fields could be tilled and the harvest came in.  His fighting bulls \nwere killed for food and the villagers tasted red meat for the first time in their lives.  When the \nNationalists captured the town on 27 August, their columns were accompanied by F\u00e9lix \nMoreno driving a black Cadillac in which he was accompanied by the other prominent \nlandowners of the area.   When soldiers rounded up those of the village menfolk that had not \nfled, he selected ten men to be shot for each of his bulls that had been slaughtered.   As \ndesperate men pleaded with him on the grounds that they were his godson, his cousin, linked \nwith him in some way, he just looked ahead and said \u2018No conozco a nadie\u2019.  At least 87 were \nshot by the soldiers on that day and twice that many over the following days.15 \n  \nThe hatred of the latifundistas paralleled that of the colonial officers for the subject \ntribesmen that it was their job to repress.  General Sanjurjo had been one of the first Spanish \nsoldiers to make the link between the subject tribes of Morocco and the Spanish left.  He \nmade a seminal speech on the subject in the wake of the atrocity at Castilblanco in Badajoz on \n29 December 1931, when villagers had murdered in four Civil Guards in an outburst of \ncollective rage at systematic oppression.  Sanjurjo\u2019s words and the subsequent revenge taken \nby the Civil Guard was but one of the ways in which the cruelty and savagery of the \nMoroccan Wars was imported into Spain and used against the working class.   Sanjurjo, \nhowever, was not the first person to make the link.  The Asturian miners\u2019 leader, Manuel \nLlaneza, wrote after the repression of the revolutionary general strike of 1917 of \u2018the African \nhatred\u2019 with which the military columns had killed and beaten workers and wrecked and \nlooted their homes.16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                        \n14 ABC (Sevilla), 24 July 1936; Ian Gibson, Queipo de Llano.

There, the African Army had unleashed a wave of terror that had \nmore to do with their normal practice when entering Moroccan villages than any threat from \nthe defeated revolutionaries.  Houses were looted, innocent men, women and children shot at \nrandom, women molested.17  The outbreak of the Civil War was to constitute a quantum leap \nin the savagery of the views of members of the military high command. \n \nThe terror visited upon the rural working class of Andalusia and Extremadura by the \nArmy of Africa revealed much about the attitudes of Spain\u2019s colonial officers.  On 7 August \n1936, in General Mola\u2019s headquarters in Burgos, a conversation took place between the \nrecently appointed governor of Burgos, Lieutenant Colonel Marcelino Gavil\u00e1n Almuzarza, \nand the Director General de Prisiones, Joaqu\u00edn del Moral.  Del Moral asserted that \u2018Espa\u00f1a es \nel pa\u00eds donde la cobard\u00eda tiene vestidos m\u00e1s bonitos.  El miedo en Espa\u00f1a se disfraza de \npacificaci\u00f3n de esp\u00edritus, de hechos diferenciales, de conllevancias, de f\u00f3rmulas.  Nadie se \natrevi\u00f3 a dar la cara a los problemas fundamentales de la Patria.\u2019 (\u2018Spain is the country where \ncowardice wears the nicest clothes.  Fear in Spain is dressed up as resolving conflict, \ntolerance of the differences between people, coexistence and formulas.  No one dared face up \nto the fundamental problems of the Fatherland.\u2019)  Gavil\u00e1n declared \u2018hay que echar al carajo \ntoda esa monserga de Derechos del Hombre, Humanitarismo, Filantrop\u00eda y dem\u00e1s t\u00f3picos \nmas\u00f3nicos\u2019 (\u2018we must get rid of all that drivel about the Rights of Man, humanitarianism, \nphilanthropy and other Masonic clich\u00e9s\u2019).  A lively conversation followed on the need to \nexterminate in Madrid \u2018tranviarios, polic\u00edas, telegrafistas y porteros\u2019 (\u2018tram workers, \npolicemen, telegraph-operators and concierges\u2019).  One of those present suggested that the \nnotice in apartment buildings that read \u2018Speak to the concierge before entering\u2019 should be \nchanged to \u2018Kill the concierge before entering\u2019.18 \n \nA couple of days later, Mola revealed even more about the military monarchy.  He \nboasted that his father, who was a crack shot with a rifle, used his wife for his frequent \n                                                 \n17 The literature on the atrocities committed by the African Army in Asturias is considerable.  Among the most \nconvincing testimonies are those assembled at the time by two relatively conservative individuals, Vicente \nMarco Miranda, a Republican prosecutor, and F\u00e9lix Gord\u00f3n Ord\u00e1s, one-time Ministry of Industry with the \nRadical party. They are reproduced in Margarita Nelken, Por qu\u00e9 hicimos la revoluci\u00f3n (Barcelona: Ediciones \nSociales Internacionales, 1936) pp.172-255 \n18 Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Iribarren, Con el general Mola: escenas y aspectos in\u00e9ditos de la guerra civil (Zaragoza: Librer\u00eda \nGeneral, 1937) pp.210-11. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           9 \nimitations of William Tell.  The unfortunate woman was expected to balance pieces of fruit \non her head and hold others in her hand as targets for her husband to show off his skill.  He \ntold his secretary, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Iribarren, that \u2018Una guerra de esta naturaleza ha de acabar por el \ndominio de uno de los dos bandos y por el exterminio absoluto y total del vencido.  A m\u00ed me \nhan matado un hermano, pero me la van a pagar.\u2019 (\u2018A war of this kind has to end with the \ndomination of one side and the total extermination of the defeated.  They\u2019ve killed one of my \nbrothers but they\u2019ll pay for it.\u2019)19  \n \n The major polemic on Guernica also threw up a number of astonishing insights into \nthe mentality of the Francoist high command and, in particular, that of General Mola.  The \nmassacre of Badajoz was a message from Franco\u2019s African columns to the people of Madrid \nabout what they could expect if they resisted.  Mola made it clear that the destruction of \nGuernica was a similar message to the people of Bilbao.  On 31 March 1937, he had opened \nthe campaign against the Basque Country with a proclamation which he broadcast and also \nhad printed as a leaflet which was dropped on the principal Basque towns.  \u2018If submission is \nnot immediate, I will raze all Vizcaya to the ground, beginning with the industries of war.  I \nhave the means to do so.\u201920  According to the U.S. Ambassador, Claude Bowers, the \ndestruction of Guernica was \u2018in line with Mola\u2019s threat to exterminate every town in [the] \nprovince unless Bilbao surrenders\u2019.21  Mola\u2019s use of aircraft of the Luftwaffe revealed much \nof his attitude to the war and its purpose.  He was obsessed with the total annihilation of \nSpanish industry as a prelude to building a \u2018clean\u2019 agrarian Spain.  This is clear from his \nspine-chilling comments at the time.  On 2 April 1937, he clashed with the commander of the \nCondor Legion, General Hugo Sperrle.  Mola wanted Sperrle to destroy Basque industry.  \nWith Bilbao about to fall to the Nationalists, this request disconcerted the German.  Mola said \n\u2018if half of all Spanish factories were destroyed by our aircraft, the subsequent reconstruction \nof Spain would be greatly facilitated.  However, the Nationalist government could not just \ndestroy industry once victory was assured.\u2019  \u2018Spain is dominated in a totally sick way by the \nindustries of Catalonia and the Basque Country.  For Spain to be made healthy, they have to \nbe destroyed.  The German Chief of Staff Wolfram von Richthofen listened thunderstruck \n                                                 \n19 Iribarren, Con el general Mola, p.223. \n20 G.L.

The Africanistas and the landowners \nviewed the landless peasants and the industrial proletariat as a racially inferior, subject \ncolonial race.  When they talked about the left, they did so in pathological terms.  It was \nbrilliantly summed up by the correspondent of the Chicago Daily Tribune, Edmund Taylor: \n\u2018The enemy was a complex molecule of a spiritual poison called communism for \nconvenience, but liberalism was the most deadly individual element in it, and the most hated.  \nIntroduced into the human organism, this poison acted like a germ virus; not only incurable, \nbut infectious.   Certain men known as the Leaders had perversely inoculated themselves with \nthe poison, and like Satan in Catholic mythology, were deliberately trying to spread the \ninfection as widely as they could.  As the incarnation of evil these men deserved punishment.  \nTheir victims who might have been good Spaniards if they had not had the bad luck to be \ninfected by the Leaders, did not merit punishment properly speaking, but they had to be shot \nin a humane way because they were incurable and might infect others.\u201923  Another, John \nWhitaker of the Chicago Daily News, put it more bluntly; \u2018The use of the Moors and the \nwholesale execution of prisoners and civilians were the trump cards of the \u201cbest\u201d elements in \nSpain\u2026  I talked with all varieties of them by the hundreds.  If I were to some up their social \nphilosophy, it would be simple in the extreme \u2013 they were outnumbered by the masses; they \nfeared the masses; and they proposed to thin down the numbers of the masses.\u201924 \n \nThe idea might have figured in such crude terms in the private conversations of army \nofficers.  In public, however, rebel propagandists thought it more respectable to talk of a \n\u2018movement\u2019 to put an end to the Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik conspiracy in order to defend \n\u2018Spain\u2019, or to be more precise, a particular and partisan definition of Spain.  From this had \nevolved the idea of a war to the death between Espa\u00f1a and the anti-Espa\u00f1a.  A revealing gloss \non this notion was given by a prosecutor during a court martial in Seville in late 1937.  \n                                                 \n22 Wolfram von Richthofen,.

In Toledo, after the liberation of the Alc\u00e1zar, there were pools \nof blood in the streets and the footprints of those who had tracked through it were evidence of \nthe mass of summary executions.   A Francoist officer explained the policy to him: \u2018we are \nfighting an idea.  The idea is in the brain, and to kill it we have to kill the man.  We must kill \neveryone who has that \u201cred\u201d idea.\u201926  The most extreme version of that theory was expounded \ninterminably by Captain Gonzalo Aguilera, the Salamanca landowner who had shot six of his \npeasants.   He had come out of voluntary retirement, rejoined the army and had been assigned \nto Franco\u2019s press and propaganda service.  His ideas were outrageous, but because he \nexpounded them so eloquently, in excellent English, and without inhibition, journalists found \nhim compellingly quotable.   Aguilera was a polo-playing cavalryman and convinced all of \nthe journalists with whom he worked that he was a great all-round sportsman. He was also the \nfourteenth Conde de Alba de Yeltes, a Grande de Espa\u00f1a and a major landowner with estates \nin the provinces of Salamanca and C\u00e1ceres.  \u2018We\u2019ve got to kill and kill and kill, you \nunderstand\u2019, he told John Whitaker.27   He was merely expressing the views of his \ncommanding officer, General Mola.  Towards the end of July 1936, the French press reported \nthat Indalecio Prieto had been encharged with negotiating with the Nationalists to put an end \nto the bloodshed.  When the General\u2019s secretary showed him the newspapers, he burst out \nangrily \u2018Negotiate!  Never!

The masses in this country are not like your Americans, nor even like the British.  \nThey are slave stock.  They are good for nothing but slaves and only when they are used as \nslaves are they happy.  But we, the decent people, made the mistake of giving them modern \nhousing in the cities where we have our factories.  We put sewers in these cities, sewers which \nextend right down to the workers\u2019 quarters.  Not content with the work of God, we thus \ninterfere with His Will.  The result is that the slave stock increases.  Had we no sewers in \nMadrid, Barcelona, and Bilbao, all these Red leaders would have died in their infancy instead \nof exciting the rabble and causing good Spanish blood to flow.  When the war is over, we \nshould destroy the sewers.  The perfect birth control for Spain is the birth control God \nintended us to have.  Sewers are a luxury to be reserved for those who deserve them, the \nleaders of Spain, not the slave stock.\u2019  One journalist who laughed at these bizarre notions, \nwas expelled from Nationalist Spain after Captain Aguilera denounced him \u2018a dangerous \nRed\u2019.29   \n \nAguilera was far from unique. Four officers in charge of the foreign press figure \nfrequently in the later accounts of correspondents.  The most frequently named were the head \nof Franco\u2019s press service, Luis Bol\u00edn, and, of course, Aguilera.  Bol\u00edn had been given an \nhonorary captaincy in the Foreign Legion as a reward for his role in securing Franco\u2019s \npassage from the Canary Islands to Morocco.  Wearing breeches and high boots, against \nwhich he would rap a riding crop, he strode menacingly among the correspondents with a \nfierce scowl.  Despite the fact that \u2018he couldn\u2019t fix a bayonet or put a clip into a rifle\u2019, he wore \nthe uniform always and behaved in a boorish manner that embarrassed the real officers of the \ncorps.  According to Sir Percival Phillips of the Daily Telegraph, they despised and detested \nhim \u2018They think he has no right to be strutting about in their uniform.\u201930  Bol\u00edn, according to \nNoel Monks of the Daily Express, would spit on piles of freshly executed Republican \n                                                                                                                                                        \n27 Whitaker, \u2018Prelude to World War\u2019, p.107. \n28 Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Iribarren, Con el general Mola: escenas y aspectos in\u00e9ditos de la guerra civil (Zaragoza: Librer\u00eda \nGeneral, 1937) pp.168-9. \n29 Charles Foltz Jr., The Masquerade in Spain (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1948) p.116. \n30 Francis McCullagh, In Franco\u2019s Spain (London: Burns, Oates & Washbourne, 1937) pp.104-7 \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n13 \nprisoners, many of them mere boys, saying \u2018Vermin!\u201931  He was loathed and feared by the \nforeign press corps because of his frequent threats to shoot newspapermen.32  He would gain a \nkind of fame by dint of his arrest and mistreatment of Arthur Koestler shortly after the \nNationalist capture of Malaga in February 1937.33 \n \nOf the rest of Bol\u00edn\u2019s subordinates, one, Lieutenant Colonel Manuel de L\u00e1mbarri y \nYanguas, was a rather amiable man who, in civilian life, had worked for the magazine \nVogue.34  Another, a Captain Ignacio Rosales, held views only slightly more refined than \nthose of Aguilera.35  According to Virginia Cowles, Rosales was a Barcelona millionaire.36  \nHe explained to his charges that \u2018the masses cannot be taught; that they need a touch of the \nwhip for they are like dogs and will mind only the whip.  There is no understanding in such \npeople, they must be got in hand.  Held in hand where they belong.\u2019  Like many officers, from \nMola downwards, Rosales also had a biological explanation of class conflict in Spain: \u2018an \ninflux of strains inimical to Spain through the industrial cities of the coast; of this taint in her \nbloodstream Spain must cleanse herself.  She is purifying herself and will rise up from this \ntrial new and strong.  The streets of Madrid will run red with blood, but after \u2013 after \u2013 there \nwill be no unemployment problem.\u201937  In fact, \u2018organic determinism\u2019 was a central part of \nSpanish right-wing thinking from Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset\u2019s Espa\u00f1a invertebrada to Ernesto \nGim\u00e9nez Caballero\u2019s Genio de Espa\u00f1a.

It is possible that the Rosales who acted as a press officer had taken retirement on full pay \nunder the Aza\u00f1a reforms of 1931 or, like Bol\u00edn, simply been given the honorary rank of captain. \n36 Cowles, Looking for Trouble, p.70. \n37 Frances Davis, My Shadow in the Sun (New York: Carrick & Evans, 1940) p.136 \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n14 \npeople\u2019.39  The most extreme version of the doctrine came, as might be expected from the pen \nof Ernesto Gim\u00e9nez Caballero.  In a pamphlet published in the Nationalist zone in 1938, he \nwrote: \u2018Nosotros los combatientes hemos visto a Franco en las altas horas de la madrugada, \nen medio del calor o de la nieve \u2013 en p\u00e1ramos, en rinconces abruptos, en mitad de un \ncampamento \u2013 tendida su alma, distendidos sus nervios sobre el plano de combate, sobre el \nMapa de Espa\u00f1a, \u201coperando en vivo sobre el cuerpo de Espa\u00f1a\u201d, con urgencia y tragedia de \nquirurgo que opera a su propia hija, a su propia madre, a su propia mujer amada.  Nosotros \nhemos visto caer las l\u00e1grimas de Franco sobre el cuerpo de esta madre, de esta mujer, de esta \nhija suya que es Espa\u00f1a, mientras en las manos le corr\u00eda la sangres y el dolor del sacro cuerpo \nen estertores\u2019 (\u2018we have seen Franco in the early hours of the morning, in the midst of heat or \nof snow, his soul and his nerves stretched to breaking point, leaning over the battle plan or the \nmap of Spain, operating on the living body of Spain with the urgency and tragedy of a \nsurgeon who operates on his own daughter, on his own mother, on his own beloved wife.  We \nhave seen Franco\u2019s tears fall on the body of this mother, of this wife, of this daughter, while \nover his hands runs the blood and the pain of the sacred body in spasms.\u2019)40  For Franco, as \nfor Aguilera and Rosales, the logic of this argument was that any individual whose ideas did \nnot fit with their conception of the patria was a symptom of a disease and therefore had to be \neradicated. \n \nAguilera gave a slightly different version of the organicist theory to Whitaker.  \u2018You \nknow what\u2019s wrong with Spain?  Modern plumbing!  In healthier times \u2013 I mean healthier \ntimes spiritually, you understand \u2013 plague and pestilence used to slaughter the Spanish \nmasses.

Now I hope you can understand what we mean by the regeneration of \nSpain.\u201941  Whitaker travelled with the senior staff of the African columns that marched on \nMadrid.  His daily conversations with them convinced him that Aguilera was completely \nrepresentative of their mentality, differing only in that he spoke perfect English and had no \n                                                                                                                                                        \n38 Michael Richards, A Time of Silence: Civil War and the Culture of Repression in Franco\u2019s Spain, 1936-\n1945  (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998) p.18; Juan Carlos Losada Malv\u00e1rez, Ideolog\u00eda del \nEj\u00e9rcito franquista 1939-1959 (Madrid: Ediciones Istmo, 1990) pp.28-30 \n39 [Francisco Franco Bahamonde,].

Born on 26 December 1886, he was educated first at Wimbledon College.  He \nfollowed in his father\u2019s footsteps when, on 5 October 1897, he entered Stonyhurst College, \nthe Jesuit public school in Lancashire, which he attended until 10 July 1904.43  His school \ncareer was singularly undistinguished.  Despite his later reputation as a gentleman scholar, he \nwas always in the lower part of his class and he left no mark of achievement in sport.44  After \nStonyhurst, he spent some time studying science and philosophy in Germany.  Of that period, \nhe recalled in his autobiography, that he had been much influenced by Kant\u2019s Critique of \nPure Reason.45 \n \nAguilera became, after the death of his father on 1 December 1919, the fourteenth \nConde de Alba de Yeltes and married Magdalena \u00c1lvarez y Ruiz.46   The fact of being a \nCount was something that he made sure was known to every journalist in his charge although, \nironically, for some reason, several of them came away with the idea that he was the \nseventeenth Count.   Given that he was prone to boasting, perhaps he hoped thereby to imply \n                                                                                                                                                        \n41 Whitaker, \u2018Prelude to World War\u2019, p.108. \n42 Whitaker, \u2018Prelude to World War\u2019, p.108. \n43 Letter from Father F.J.Turner S.J., Stonyhurst College Archivist; to the author, 19 May 1999; Arnold Lunn, \nSpanish Rehearsal (London: Hutchinson, 1937) p.70. \n44 Letter from Father Turner to the author. \n45 Conde de Alba de Yeltes, Cartas a un sobrino (n.p., n.d.) p.28.   \n46 Juan Xim\u00e9nez Emb\u00fan, & Angel Gonz\u00e1lez Palencia, Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de los documentos referentes a \nt\u00edtulos del Reino y Grandezas de Espa\u00f1a conservados en la secci\u00f3n de Consejos Suprimidos (Madrid: \nPatronato Nacional de Archivos Hist\u00f3ricos, 1951) pp.36-7, 51; J.Atienza, Nobiliario espa\u00f1ol: diccionario \nher\u00e1ldico de apellidos espa\u00f1oles y t\u00edtulos nobiliarios 3\u00aa edici\u00f3n (Madrid: Aguilar, 1959) p.790.

Similarly, he led his friends in the press corps to \nbelieve that he had served with great gallantry in the Moroccan War fighting at the head of a \nunit of mounted Regulares and had distinguished himself because of his courage and a \nrecklessness bordering on the suicidal.  One admirer described him as \u2018a hard-bitten ex-\ncavalryman of what I believe is known as \u2018The Old School\u2019.47   There is no reason to dispute \neither that he saw action or shared to the full the prejudices of his peers.  However, in a war in \nwhich the rewards for courage and temerity were significant, as the meteoric career of \nFrancisco Franco showed, his military records show little of significance.  He had joined the \nSpanish Army on 25 February 1908 as a private in the cavalry and was posted to an army stud \nfarm.  He took immediate leave of absence until August 1908. When he entered the cavalry \nacademy in Valladolid.  To the intense annoyance of his father, he did not use his intellectual \nability and was a lazy student.  Nevertheless, he graduated as a second lieutenant (alf\u00e9rez) in \nJune 1911.48   \n \nIn 1910, Gonzalo had fallen in love with a celebrated beauty in Salamanca, In\u00e9s Luna \nTerrero.  She was extremely rich and, like Gonzalo, spoke English, French and German.  She \nwas a progressive feminist who shocked local opinion because she smoked and wore trousers.  \nShe was devastated when, in 1911, Gonzalo broke off the engagement in favour of Magdalena \n\u00c1lvarez Ruiz, the daughter of a cochero (a man who hired out carriages and cars).  In\u00e9s Luna \nTerrero never married and apparently, for the rest of her life, carried a torch for the dashingly \nhandsome cavalry officer.  Gonzalo\u2019s father was furious and forbade him to see Magdalena.49  \nGonzalo was posted to Melilla in February 1912, where he spent a month on the staff of the \n\u2018Captain General of the Territory\u2019 before being posted to a series of fighting units.  After \nseeing action, he was awarded the Cruz primera clase del Merito Militar on 10 November \n1912.  He was promoted to first lieutenant on 13 July 1913.  He was then posted to the \nmainland, remaining in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares and Madrid.  He seemed to lead a relatively \nprivileged existence, spending two months leave in London in the summer of 1914 and taking \npart in horse trials in Badajoz in 1915.  In October 1915, he was posted to the staff of the \n                                                 \n47 Kemp, Mine Were of Trouble, p.49; Lunn, Spanish Rehearsal, pp.42, 50. \n48 Hoja de servicios de Gonzalo Aguilera y Munro, Archivo General Militar de Segovia.  The information on his \nfather\u2019s attitude derives from the testimony to the author, 30 July 1999, of the Cronista de la Ciudad de \nSalamanca, Dr Salvador Llopis Llopis, who has had access to the correspondence between Gonzalo de Aguilera \nand In\u00e9s Luna Terrero. \n49 Testimony to the author, 30 July 1999, of the Cronista de la Ciudad de Salamanca, Dr Salvador Llopis Llopis, \nbiographer of In\u00e9s Luna Terrero. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n17 \nMinistry of War.50  He had continued to see Magdalena Alvarez whom he had set up in an \napartment in Madrid.  In awe of his father, he kept the relationship a secret.  Eventually in \n1916, Magdalena became pregnant and bore him a son, Gonzalo, out of wedlock. He \ncontinued to support her in the Madrid apartment.  Only after his father died was he able to \nmarry her in 1920.51 \n \nOn 19 June 1916, because of his fluent German, English and French, he was sent to \nBerlin where, as a junior military attach\u00e9, he assisted in the Spanish Embassy\u2019s work \nprotecting prisoners of war until 20 November 1917.   What he saw on the both the Eastern \nand Western fronts, profoundly affected him.  However, he seems to have internalised his \nreactions.  At the time, and until thirty years later, it did nothing to diminish his enthusiasm \nfor the military life. He wrote of it in the late 1940s or early 1950s in his autobiographical \n\u2018letters to a nephew\u2019, (\u2018Como sabes, durante la I Guerra Mundial me toc\u00f3 estar en Alemania y \nvi de cerca aquellas monta\u00f1as de dolor y sufrimiento que lleva consigo la guerra moderna y \nde las que el individuo no tiene escape posible aquellos montones de cadaveres de hombres, \nmujeres y ni\u00f1os por las carreteras heladas de Polonia, aquellas ingentes matanzas del Oeste \ndonde adem\u00e1s pude observar de cerca las primeras victimas de gases, que al toser arrancaban \ntejidos mucosos bronquiales. Aix la Chapelle casi entero era un hospital de sangre y en d\u00edas \nde gran batalla ve\u00eda cargar los camiones de brazos y piernas para llevarlos a enterrar, y en la \nretaguardia los dolores familiares y la ruina econ\u00f3mica.

Those piles of corpses of men, women and children at the side of the \nfrozen roads of Poland, that huge massacres in the West where I could also observe the first \nvictims of poison gas who coughed up thick bronchial mucous.  Aix-la-Chapelle in its entirety \nwas a field hospital and on the days of major battles, I saw lorries being loaded with arms and \nlegs to be taken for burial.  In the rearguard, I saw the sorrows of families and economic ruin.  \nThere I began to cease being a Christian; for it is not possible that a loving and omniscient \ndeity could not find other means to fulfil its ends than through the martyrdom and perdition of \n                                                 \n50 Hoja de servicios de Gonzalo Aguilera y Munro, Archivo General Militar de Segovia. \n51 Testimony to the author, 30 July 1999, of the Cronista de la Ciudad de Salamanca, Dr Salvador Llopis Llopis, \nbiographer of In\u00e9s Luna Terrero.

Certainly, his enthusiasm for \nthe slaughter of the \u2018Reds\u2019 during the Spanish Civil War suggested that it had done nothing to \nhumanise him. \n \nOn his return from Germany to Spain, he served in mainland posts, in Madrid and \nSalamanca.  He was promoted to Captain in July 1919.  He often spent lengthy periods of \nleave in Paris and London.  He took eighteen months leave of absence from March 1924 to \nAugust 1925, during which time his second son, Agust\u00edn, was born.  At some point in his \ncareer, he was aide de camp to General Sanjurjo.  He was not involved in the successful \npacification of Morocco in 1925, although he served again briefly in Africa.  In December \n1926, he was posted to Tetu\u00e1n where he was involved at the head of a Tabor of mounted \nRegulares patrolling and protecting the roads surrounding the town \u2013 which could be the basis \nof his boasts of courageous exploits.53   He remained in Morocco until August 1927, after \nwhich he passed into the reserve (situaci\u00f3n de disponible) having been seconded to the \nMilitary Household of Alfonso XIII and became a personal friend of the King.  He retired \nfrom the Army in protest at the requirement that officers swear an oath of loyalty to the \nRepublic.  He took advantage of the generous voluntary retirement terms of the decrees of 25 \nand 29 April 1931 promulgated by the newly installed Minister of War, Manuel Aza\u00f1a.54   \n \nOn the outbreak of war, Aguilera came out of retirement and volunteered for the \nnationalist forces.  He was informally attached to the general staff of General Mola, \ncommander of the Army of the North.  Because he spoke fluent English, French and German, \nhe had been given the task of supervising the movements and the production of the foreign \npress correspondents \u2013 sometimes serving as a guide, others as a censor.  According to Sefton \nDelmer, he \u2018spoke the best English of all the officers on Mola\u2019s staff\u2019.55  His English was so \ngood that, according to Harold Cardozo of the Daily Mail, he could easily have been taken for \n                                                 \n52 Alba de Yeltes, Cartas, p.101. \n53 Hoja de servicios de Gonzalo Aguilera y Munro, Archivo General Militar de Segovia; Archivo General \nMilitar de Segovia;  \u00cdndice de expedientes personales (Madrid: Ediciones Hidalgu\u00eda, 1959) I, p.57.

He was involved in the Nationalist capture of Ir\u00fan on 4 September.  The \nentire, and extremely bloody, combat was witnessed by the foreign press corps which he led \ninto the town as if they were a unit of the conquering Nationalist forces.57 He had also taken \npart in action in the Guadarrama and Somosierra passes to the north of Madrid as Mola\u2019s \nforces threatened the capital.   When Mola\u2019s Army of the North finally made contact with \nFranco\u2019s African columns in early September, Aguilera moved south to take the press corps to \ncover the attacks on Toledo and Madrid.  On one occasion, during that advance, Aguilera and \nCaptain Roland von Strunk, a German military observer, in Spain under the cover of being \ncorrespondent of the Nazi V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter, fought off Republican militiamen with \nrifle fire until they were rescued from a perilous position.  They were commended for the \nnumber of the enemy that they killed.  During the siege of Madrid, Aguilera took part in \ncombat action in the Casa de Campo, Pozuelo, Aravaca and Jarama.58 \n  \nUnlike most press officers who felt responsible for the safety of the journalists \nassigned to them, Aguilera operated on the principle that, if risks had to be taken to get stories \nthen, so long as they were favourable to the Nationalists, he would help the reporters taken \nthem. He regularly took his charges into the firing line and was \u2018bombed, machine-gunned \nand shelled\u2019 with them.59  It was the most frequent complaint of the journalists in the \nNationalist zone that they were expected to publish anodyne communiqu\u00e9s while being kept \naway from hard news.  This was more often the case when the Nationalists were doing badly \nand especially so for journalists regarded as too \u2018independent\u2019.  Even favoured individuals \nwere subjected to humiliating delays while waiting to be issued with passes for accompanied \nvisits to the front.60  Accordingly, Aguilera was extremely popular with the right-wing \njournalists that met him because he was prepared to take them dangerously near to the front \nand would use his influence with the censor to help them get their stories through.  He drove a \n                                                 \n56 Harold G.Cardozo, The March of a Nation.

According to \nHarold Cardozo, \u2018it was one of the most temperamental cars I have ever seen.  It either rushed \nahead at some seventy miles an hour, taking corners in hair-raising style, or else it sulked and \nthe whole line of Press cars was reduced to following it at not much faster than a walking \npace.\u201961  Arnold Lunn found Aguilera\u2019s skilful but carefree driving a terrifying yet \nexhilarating experience, the key to which he thought was a typically Spanish oriental fatalism \nand indifference to death.  Junkets to the front organized by Aguilera were regarded as \nparticularly exciting given his delight at being under fire and his assumption that the \njournalists shared his addiction to danger.62  Cardozo, for instance, despite his \u2018hair-raising\u2019 \ndriving, regarded him as \u2018often a good friend to journalists\u2019.63  H.R.Knickerbocker of the \nInternational News Service thought him \u2018our best friend of all the White officers\u2026   Captain \nAguilera is fifty-two, looks forty, acts thirty, and is the best press officer it has ever been my \npleasure to meet, because he really takes us to the news, namely the front.\u201964  Sefton Delmer, \ndespite being expelled from Nationalist Spain by Aguilera, wrote later he would \u2018always have \nthe warmest affection\u2019 for him.  While in Burgos, he called him \u2018Aggy\u2019 and they remained \nfriends after the war.65  More liberal journalists were nauseated by the Count\u2019s political \nattitudes \u2013 a mixture of callous cruelty and high-minded snobbery. In addition to his racism \nand his sexism, Aguilera was convinced that a crucial issue which would influence the \noutcome of the war was \u2018the existence and the influence of satanic powers\u2019.66 \n \nAccording to the American correspondent, Edmond Taylor, Aguilera was \u2018a cultured \nman with the mannerisms and trick of speech of an officer in the Indian army.\u201967  That was \nnot uncommon in the Nationalist press apparatus.  At its Burgos headquarters, the fledgling \nAmerican journalist, Frances Davis, encountered an officer who spoke Oxford English as he \nsmacked his boots with a riding crop \u2013 probably Bol\u00edn or Aguilera.  After explaining to her \nthat the press would be at the orders of the army, he changed the subject and asked if she had \n                                                                                                                                                        \n60 Davis, My Shadow, pp.130-1, 165, 171.

One dimension of his theory was that \u2018the war was a conflict \nbetween Nordic and Oriental ideologies, the Oriental element, represented by the Reds, \nnaturally, having been introduced into Spain by the Moors, who in the course of time became \nthe slaves of the northern Spaniards and thus begat the proletariat.  The proletariat having \nbeen converted to Marxism, an Oriental doctrine which was in their blood anyhow, were now \ntrying to conquer Spain for the Orient, and the insurrection was quite literally a second \nreconquista by the Christian Nordics.\u201969   \n \nArnold Lunn, old Harrovian, prominent Tory and Catholic, thought Aguilera \u2018not only \na soldier but a scholar\u2019.  In the Sierra de Gredos, Aguilera said to Lunn: \u2018The Reds are always \nranting about the illiteracy in Spain, but if they\u2019d spend a few months living among the \nmountains they might begin to understand that the people who can\u2019t read are often wiser than \nthe people who can.  Wisdom isn\u2019t the same thing as education.  I have got shepherds on my \nfarms who are immensely wise, perhaps because they read the stars and the fields and perhaps \nbecause they don\u2019t read newspapers.\u2019  He was clearly an element of social discrimination in \nhis views since he also boasted of having a library of three thousand books.  He believed it to \nhave been vandalised by the mob in Madrid, a cause of understandable bitterness.70  After the \nCivil War, he wrote two books himself.  Only the first, on the atom, was published in 1946.  It \ncarried on its frontispiece a note stating that \u2018Toda vez que el producto econ\u00f3mico que \npudiera sacarse de esta obra es destinado a beneficio de las Hermanitas de los Pobres de una \ndeterminada provinicia, no se regalan ejemplares\u2019 (\u2018Given that the profits, such as they are, of \nthis book are intended to benefit The Little Sisters of the Poor of a certain province, there will \nbe no complimentary copies\u2019).71  The second, written in the early 1950s, did not find a \npublisher.  It was an idiosyncratic and autobiographical work in which he developed ideas not \ndissimilar to those with which he had regaled journalists during the war.72  \n \n                                                 \n68 Frances Davis, My Shadow in the Sun (New York: Carrick & Evans, 1940) pp.98-9. \n69 Taylor, \u2018Assignment in Hell\u2019, p.61. \n70 Lunn, Spanish Rehearsal, pp.50, 59, 70. \n71 Conde de Alba de Yeltes, El \u00e1tomo.

The book was poorly type-set, presumably at \nAguilera\u2019s own expense, but not published.  The copy in the Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid contains the later \naddition of several typescript pages, pasted in, presumably by Aguilera himself. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n22 \nAn English volunteer on Franco\u2019s side, Peter Kemp, also asserted that Aguilera was \nwidely read, very knowledgeable about literature, history and science, with a brilliant if \neccentric intellect and a command of vituperation that earned him the nickname during the \nCivil War of El Capit\u00e1n Veneno (Captain Poison).73   He had a long historical view of why \nthe Western democracies were decadent: \u2018The people in Britain and America are beginning to \ngo Communist the way the French have gone.  There\u2019s that man Baldwin in England.  \nDoesn\u2019t even know he is a red, but the reds control him.  And, of course, that man Roosevelt \nis a howling red.   But it goes back further than Baldwin and Roosevelt.  It begins with the \nEncyclopedists in France - the American and French revolutions.  The Age of Reason indeed!  \nThe Rights of Man!  Does a pig have rights?  The masses aren\u2019t fit to reason and to think.  \nThen you pick up with the liberal Manchester school in England.  They are the criminals who \nmade capitalism.  You ought to clean up your own houses.  If you don\u2019t, we Spaniards are \ngoing to join the Germans and Italians in conquering you all.  The Germans have already \npromised to help us get back our American colonies which you and your crooked Protestant \nimperialism robbed us of.  And we\u2019re going to act pretty soon, you understand.\u201974 \n \nDespite his adventurism, Aguilera expected \u2018his\u2019 journalists to toe the line.  On 11 \nSeptember 1936, F.A.Rice, the correspondent of the conservative Morning Post, went to \nBurgos to seek a pass to the front.  He was detained and interrogated by Aguilera.  He had \nfirst met Aguilera on 25 August and had posted a despatch that sought to give a picture of the \nStonyhurst old-boy that would appeal to the paper\u2019s predominantly Public School readership.  \nHe wrote about Aguilera, without mentioning his name, merely as \u2018a Spanish captain\u2019:  \n\u2018Tremendously efficient, almost impossibly brisk, a good man, one would imagine, in a tight \nplace; I can see him as a prefect at Stonyhurst, greatly respected and not very popular\u2019.  In \nanother piece, sent from France and not therefore subjected to the rebel censorship, Rice had \nused the phrase \u2018insurgent frightfulness\u2019 in relation to the rebel attack on Ir\u00fan on 1 September.  \nAguilera objected to both articles.  He accused Rice of divulging his name in the first \ndespatch \u2013 which he had not done.  Nonetheless, Aguilera judged Rice\u2019s references to him to \nindicate \u2018a not wholly respectful attitude\u2019.  Rice pointed out to Aguilera \u2018that the information \nthat he was an old Stoneyhurst boy had been volunteered by himself and was clearly of \ninterest to an English correspondent and that I had not been given it in confidence.  He \n                                                 \n73 Kemp, Mine Were of Trouble, p.50. \n74 Whitaker, \u2018Prelude to World War\u2019, p.108; John T.Whitaker, We Cannot Escape History (New York: \nMacmillan, 1943) pp.108-110. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n23 \nsuggested that the doubt thrown on his popularity at school twenty years ago, was damaging \nand actionable.\u2019  What Rice referred to later as \u2018these singularly humourless exchanges\u2019 \ncontinued with Aguilera\u2019s outrage at the use of the phrase \u2018insurgent frightfulness\u2019.   He \nreminded Rice that the journalists would \u2018be seriously dealt with\u2019 if they referred to the rebels \nas \u2018insurgents\u2019 or to the Republicans as \u2018loyalists\u2019 or \u2018Government troops\u2019 instead of \u2018Reds\u2019.   \nAguilera gave Rice a stark choice.  He could leave Spain or remain under strict vigilance, \nwithout permission to cross the frontier \u2013 which was the only way of filing a story outside the \nFrancoist censorship.  \u2018My messages would be heavily censored and twisted to the insurgent \nview.  Those correspondents who represent journals of policy wholly favourable to the \ninsurgents would have priority in the sending of messages, and as one who hitherto has been \nadmitted to both sides, I had no guarantee when I should be allowed out.\u2019  Rice chose to \nleave.  He was searched at Pamplona, his films confiscated and personal letters read, then \nescorted to the frontier.  Rice\u2019s newspaper, the Morning Post commented on his expulsion in \nan editorial.  \u2018It proclaims urbi et urbi that any news emanating from Right sources belongs \nrather to the realm of propaganda than to that of fact.\u2019 75  \n \nAguilera had Sefton Delmer expelled from Nationalist Spain on the grounds that his \ndispatches published information likely to be of use to the enemy and also were \u2018calculated to \nmake the Spanish armed forces look ridiculous\u2019.  The report in question had recounted a \nRepublican air raid on Burgos.  Delmer had  described how a small British  plane had \ninadvertently arrived in the midst of it, attracted the anti-aircraft fire of the Burgos batteries \nand still landed unscathed.  The dispatch, Aguilera told him over a drink, \u2018not only \nencourages the Reds to attack Burgos again.  But it makes our ack-ack gunners look \ninefficient\u2019.  Aguilera liked Delmer and so confided in him that he did not give a damn what \nthe reporter said about the artillery since he was a cavalry man himself.76   \n \nIn the case of John Whitaker, whom Aguilera had every reason to regard as hostile to \nthe Nationalist cause, the treatment was altogether more sinister.  At first, Aguilera had been \nsympathetic to Whitaker because he had been decorated with the Italian Croce di Guerra in \nEthiopia.  He had taken Whitacker on trips which the Nationalist propaganda bureau had \nvetoed.  However, having got to know a number of the field commanders of the African \n                                                 \n75 \u2018A Journalist\u2019, Foreign Journalists under Franco\u2019s Terror (London: United Editorial, 1937) pp.26-30. \nCf.Herbert R.Southworth, Guernica!

He \nbegan to visit the front to see things for himself.  Aguilera felt that Whitaker was seeing \nFrancoist methods that he was not meant to.   In the early hours of one morning during the \nmarch on Madrid, Aguilera turned up at Whitaker\u2019s lodgings with a Gestapo agent and \nthreatened to have him shot if he went near the front except on accompanied tours.  \u2018Next \ntime you\u2019re unescorted at the front, and under fire, we\u2019ll shoot you.  We\u2019ll say that you were a \ncasualty to enemy action.  You understand!\u201977  From a Francoist point of view, Aguilera was \nentirely correct in his instinct that Whitaker was dangerous.  His recollections of what he saw \nin Spain are among the most blood-curdling, and convincing, accounts of the behaviour of the \nArmy of Africa.   \n \nAfter Franco\u2019s armies were halted at Madrid, Aguilera both accompanied journalists \nand took up arms in the various battles around the capital in early 1937 that followed.   \nDuring the Francoist effort to close the circle around Madrid, he fought in the battle of \nJarama. He also played a duel role throughout the Nationalist campaign against the Basque \ncountry during the spring of 1937.  He took part in fighting having attached himself to the \nBrigadas de Navarra and he also continued to watch over the press corps.  During the attack \non Bilbao, he entered the city before the bulk of Mola\u2019s forces accompanied by some of the \nmore hot-blooded and reckless members of the press corps.  Aguilera, his colleague Major \nLambarri and a group of journalists including Harold Cardozo of the Daily Mail, were \nmobbed by an enthusiastic pro-Nationalist crowd.  Cardozo and the other journalists were \nwearing the red berets of the Carlist requet\u00e9 and felt embarrassed to have been f\u00eated under \nfalse pretences.  Major Lambarri merely laughed saying \u2018I was kissed by much prettier girls \nthan you\u2019.  Cardozo felt that, in contrast, Aguilera was seriously displeased.   \u2018His strict \nmilitary mind and his personal political tendencies made him view this involuntary \nassociation of foreigners in what he looked upon as an occasion for intimate Spanish patriotic \nrejoicing with rather a jaundiced eye, and he was somewhat sarcastic and biting in his \ncomments.\u201978  \n \n                                                                                                                                                        \n76 Delmer, Trail Sinister, pp.277-8. \n77 Whitaker, \u2018Prelude to World War\u2019, p.109. \n78 Informe GAM, leg.416, AGMS; Cardozo, The March of a Nation, pp.286-301.

This involved the intense vigilance of \u2018untrustworthy\u2019 journalists who \ntried to get near the ruins of the town and the expulsion of those who wrote unwelcome \nreports.  It also extended to giving strong guidance to sympathetic journalists as to how their \narticles should be written.79   In this regard, there took place an incident that was to cause him, \nand his superiors, some embarrassment.  This was the arrest of Hubert Knickerbocker during \nthe campaign against the Basque country in April 1937.  Knickerbocker was a journalist who, \nthrough his articles in the Hearst press chain, had done much for the Francoist cause.80  He \nwas halted at the frontier when he attempted to cross from France into Spain.  This sign of \ngrowing intolerance of foreign correspondents on the Francoist side was interpreted by the \nAmerican Ambassador, Claude Bowers, as meaning that \u2018there must be something in the \npresent situation that General Franco does not care to have blazoned to the world.\u201981  Despite \nbeing told that he could not proceed into Spain, Knickerbocker sneaked over the frontier.  He \nwas caught and imprisoned in San Sebasti\u00e1n for thirty six hours.  He was released only after a \nconsiderable fuss was made by Randolph Churchill.  Knickerbocker was then expelled from \nSpain.  Believing that his plight was the consequence of a denunciation by Captain Aguilera, \nKnickerbocker exacted revenge in a highly effective devastating fashion.  He simply \npublished, in the Washington Times on 10 May 1937, an account of Aguilera\u2019s anti-Semitic, \nmisogynistic, anti-democratic opinions and, in particular, his claim that \u201cWe are going to \nshoot 50,000 in Madrid.  And no matter where Aza\u00f1a and Largo Caballero (the Premier) and \nall that crowd try to escape, we\u2019ll catch them and kill every last man, if it takes years of \ntracking them throughout the world.\u201d \n \nKnickerbocker\u2019s article was quoted extensively in the U.S. Congress on 12 May 1937.  \nIt may be presumed to have been a significant propaganda blow against the Francoists, \ncoming as it did shortly after the bombing of Guernica.  Aguilera, rendered as a mythical \nCaptain S\u00e1nchez, was quoted as saying \u2018It is a race war, not merely a class war.  You don\u2019t \nunderstand because you don\u2019t realize that there are two races in Spain \u2013 a slave race and a \nruler race.  Those reds, from President Aza\u00f1a to the anarchists, are all slaves.  It is our duty to \nput them back into their places \u2013 yes, put chains on them again, if you like.\u2019  Furious about \n                                                 \n79 Herbert R.Southworth, Guernica!

His beliefs on the pernicious \neffects of education had also been expounded to Knickerbocker: \u2018We must destroy this spawn \nof \u201cred\u201d schools which the so-called republic installed to teach the slaves to revolt.  It is \nsufficient for the masses to know just enough reading to understand orders.  We must restore \nthe authority of the Church.  Slaves need it to teach them to behave.\u2019  He had repeated to \nKnickerbocker views about women roughly similar to those to which he had treated Whitaker: \n\u2018It is damnable that women should vote.  Nobody should vote \u2013 least of all women.\u2019  Liberty \nwas \u2018a delusion employed by the \u201creds\u201d to fool the so-called democrats.  In our state, people \nare going to have the liberty to keep their mouths shut.\u2019   The Jews, he believed, were \u2018an \ninternational pest\u2019.82 \n \nAfter the excitement of the Basque campaign, Aguilera was transferred from Mola\u2019s \ngeneral staff to the Delegaci\u00f3n del Estado para Prensa y Propaganda.83  It made little \ndifference to his readiness to be directly involved at the front.  He took part in the subsequent \nassault on Santander, again accompanying the Navarrese Brigades.  He actually entered the \ndefeated city on 24 August 1937, accompanied by the correspondent of the Times two hours \nbefore any other Nationalist forces.  He drove through thousands of Republican militiamen, \nstill armed but utterly paralysed and dejected by the rapidity of their defeat.84   Shortly after, \nVirginia Cowles found herself in the recently captured city.  Captain Aguilera offered to drive \nher to Le\u00f3n where she would be nearer Franco\u2019s headquarters as he continued with his attack \non Asturias.  He still had the pale yellow Mercedes on the back seat of which he kept two \nlarge rifles and \u2018a chauffeur who drove so badly he was usually encouraged to sleep\u2019.  \nWearing cavalry boots and spurs, a cap from which a blue tassel swung, he drove as if riding \na race-horse.  Since the roads were clogged by refugees and Italian troops, he would drive \nalong cursing at other traffic. He occasionally complained \u2018You never see any pretty girls.  \nAny girl who hasn\u2019t got a face like a boot can get a ride in an Italian truck.\u2019   He gave little \nsign of being on his best behaviour for a foreign correspondent.

On stopping to ask the way and asking someone who turned out to \nbe German, he said \u2018Nice chaps, the Germans, but a bit too serious; they never seem to have \nany women around, but I suppose they didn\u2019t come for that.  If they kill enough Reds, we can \nforgive them anything.\u201d85 \u2018Blast the Reds!\u2019 he said to Virginia Cowles, \u2018Why did they have to \nput ideas into people\u2019s heads?  Everyone knows that people are fools and much better off told \nwhat to do than trying to run themselves.  Hell is too good for the Reds.  I\u2019d like to impale \nevery one and see them wriggling on poles like butterflies\u2026\u2019  The Captain paused to see what \nimpression his speech had made, but I gave no reply, which seemed to anger him.  \u2018There\u2019s \nonly one thing I hate worse than a Red,\u2019 he blazed. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019  \u2018A sob-sister!\u201986   \n \nDuring the attack on Gij\u00f3n, Aguilera spotted a long line of men with picks and \nshovels.  \u2018Red prisoners, captured at Santander\u2019, he told his journalistic charges.  I hear they \nbuilt one of the mountain roads in eight days.  Not much chance for sleep, eh?  That\u2019s the way \nto treat them.  If we didn\u2019t need roads I would like to borrow a rifle and pick off a couple\u2019.87 \nVirginia Cowles asked another officer if the ordinary soldiers in the Nationalist Army knew \nwhy they were fighting.  Keen to oblige, the officer amiably picked a young soldier at random \nand asked him.  The boy replied \u2018We are fighting the Reds\u2019.  She asked him what he meant by \n\u2018the Reds\u2019, and he said, \u2018The people who have been misled by Moscow.\u2019  Why did he think \nthey had been misled?  And he answered: \u2018They are very poor.  In Spain it is easy to be \nmisled\u201d.   This innocuous answer infuriated Aguilera who was listening.  He rounded on the \nboy, \u2018So you think people aren\u2019t satisfied?\u2019  The terrified boy stammered \u2018I didn\u2019t say that, \nSe\u00f1or\u2019 to which Aguilera replied brutally \u2018You said they were poor.  It sounds to me as \nthough you are filled with Red ideas yourself.\u201988  By now, Captain Aguilera regarded Virginia \nCowles as a Red herself as a result of a slight remark.  When he was ranting about the sheer \ndestructiveness of the \u2018Reds\u2019 beause they had blown up a bridge, she had observed that \nperhaps they were simply trying to block the Nationalist advance.  The suggestion that the \n\u2018Reds\u2019 were motivated by military logic rather than intrinsic evil provoked him to glare at her \nand snap \u2018You talk like a Red\u2019.   With a hostile report on her unreliability, he put events into \n                                                 \n85 Virginia Cowles, Looking for Trouble (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1941) pp.86-7. \n86 Virginia Cowles, Looking for Trouble (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1941) p.90. \n87 Cowles, Looking for Trouble, p.92. \n88 Cowles, Looking for Trouble, p.93. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n28 \ntrain for her to be arrested.  Fortunately, for her, a chain of chance encounters permitted to get \nto the French border.89 \n \nAguilera\u2019s English admirer, Peter Kemp, wrote after the war \u2018Loyal friend, fearless \ncritic and stimulating companion that he was, I sometimes wonder if his qualities really fitted \nhim for the job he was given of interpreting the Nationalist cause to important strangers.  For \nexample, he told a distinguished English visitor about shooting six of his farm labourers \u2013 \n\u2018Pour encourager les autres, you understand.\u2019  Kemp\u2019s doubts derived from Aguilera\u2019s \n\u2018original ideas on the fundamental causes of the Civil War.  The principal cause, if I \nremember rightly, was the introduction of modern drainage.  Prior to this, the riff-raff had \nbeen killed off by various useful diseases; now they survived and, of course, were above \nthemselves.  Another entertaining theory was that the Nationalists should shoot all the boot-\nblacks.\u2019  \u2018My dear fellow\u2019, Aguilera explained to Kemp, \u2018it only stands to reason!  A chap \nwho squats down on his knees to clean your boots at a caf\u00e9 or in the street is bound to be a \nCommunist, so why not shoot him right away and be done with it?  No need for a trial \u2013 his \nguilt is self-evident in his profession.\u201990 After Peter Kemp\u2019s memoirs were published, \nAguilera took out a writ against him because of the story about shooting the farm labourers.  \nAccording to his publishers, Kemp withdrew the story \u2013 to little avail, since the book was \nalready out of print.  In any case, he had repeated the story to others, including the \ncorrespondent of the French Havas Agency, Jean d\u2019Hospital.91  Clearly, it never occurred to \nhim that his disquisitions were sufficiently remarkable to find their way into print.   \n \nAlthough Aguilera was uninhibited when talking with journalists, particularly if he \nthought they were right-wing sympathizers of the Francoist cause, he never forgot his job as a \npropagandist for that cause.   When the Nationalist armies conquered Asturias, the repression \ncarried out by the Moorish Regulares and the Legion was particularly fierce.92  It is hardly \nsurprising that Aguilera was anxious to ensure that no photographs were taken of soldiers \ncarrying umbrellas or pushing bicycles lest it give the impression that they were looting.  \nNevertheless, he was not above a little looting himself, and \u2018was heard murmuring that there \n                                                 \n89 Cowles, Looking for Trouble, pp.95-9. \n90 Kemp, Mine Were of Trouble, p.50. \n91 Letter from Cassell & Co. to Herbert R.Southworth, 27 March 1968, and interview of Southworth with \nd\u2019Hospital, 14 September 1968, Southworth, Guernica!

While he was \nrecovering from the shock of being missed by inches, I jumped out, seized him by the scruff \nof the neck and bundled him into the car.  The village was near the top of the mountain pass, \nand I drove downhill for eight miles while he whimpered beside me.  I then turned him out of \nthe car, and left him to walk home.  I bet he sweated before he got there.  That chap was a \ntypical Iberian.  You know your Don Quixote, don\u2019t you?  Well, Quixote is the conquering \nFranco-Norman type, tall, fair, blue eyes, and so on.  Sancho Panza, on the other hand, is a \nsturdy, thick-set Iberian.  There was nothing wrong with the Sancho Panzas until the Reds got \nhold of them, but of course they\u2019ll never produce leaders.\u201994  On another occasion, he shot his \nchauffeur for running his car off the road.  \u2018He was a red all the time\u2019, he explained.95 \n \nAguilera told Lunn one day \u2018It is the melancholy duty of our generation to act as the \nministers of exemplary justice.  We can only save Spain from a repetition of these horrors if \nwe impress upon the minds of this generation a fact of supreme importance, the fact that there \nis a God in heaven and justice on earth.\u201996  Aguilera was wonderfully complacent.  On the \nMoors, he said, \u2018We are proud to fight side by side with them, and they are proud to fight with \nus.  After the Moroccan War we sent soldiers to govern them, and had no trouble until the \nSpanish Republic started sending politicians.  If that had lasted, we should have lost \nMorocco.\u201997  His view of the Moors of the Regulares and the Legion was not shared by other \nobservers.  Edmund Taylor wrote \u2018they had carried with them out of Africa a spiritual \natmosphere like the stench in the den of a beast of prey, stench of carrion and of the beast.\u201998 \n \n                                                 \n93 Cecil Gerahty, The Road to Madrid (London: Hutchinson, 19370 p.35. \n94 Lunn, Spanish Rehearsal, p.62. \n95 Whitaker, We Cannot Escape History, p.115. \n96 Lunn, Spanish Rehearsal, p.63. \n97 Lunn, Spanish Rehearsal, p.66. \n98 Edmond Taylor, \u2018Assignment in Hell\u2019 in Frank C.Hanighen, Nothing but Danger (London: Harrap, 1940) \np.68. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n30 \nJohn Whitaker regarded Captain Aguilera as merely the mouthpiece for many on the \nNationalist side.  Indeed, precisely for this reason, Luis Bol\u00edn kept a tight rein on the press \nofficers.  According to Sir Percival Phillips of the Daily Telegraph, the majority of them \u2018are \nyoung grandees or diplomats, amiable weaklings for the most part, ruled by Bustamente [a \npseudonym for Bol\u00edn] with a rod of iron.  He telephones them at all hours of the day and \nnight, scolding, ordering but never advising, and, as a result of this drilling, they never \nexpress an opinion, even on the weather, lest some correspondent should cable that such-and-\nsuch a view is held \u201cin G.H.Q.\u201d or \u201cin well-informed circles\u201d or \u201cby spokesmen of the \nGeneral\u00edsimo\u201d\u2026 they also keep all officers away from us as carefully as if we had the \nplague\u201d.99  Despite Bol\u00edn\u2019s efforts, it was not difficult to find many with views similar to \nthose of Aguilera.   Rosales\u2019 theories were like those that Taylor, Knickerbocker, Whitaker \nand others had heard from Aguilera.    \n \nIf the views of Aguilera could be dismissed as simply the exaggerations of a bluff \nsoldier, perhaps more significance could be attributed to the writings of a man like Dr Enrique \nSu\u00f1er, who had been professor of pediatry at Madrid University (catedr\u00e1tico de Pediatr\u00eda de la \nUniversidad Central) before the war and was vice-president of the Education and Culture \nCommittee of Franco\u2019s military government, the Junta T\u00e9cnica del Estado (vice-presidente  de \nla Comisi\u00f3n de Educaci\u00f3n y Cultura de la Junta T\u00e9cnica del Estado).  In 1937, he surveyed \nthe blood shed during the war.  He saw two kinds of blood.  On the one hand, there was that \n\u2018of conscious criminals, authors of the blood sacrifices that we suffer, of vile brutes, with \nworse instincts that those of wild beasts\u2019 (de conscientes criminales, autores de las \nhecatombes que padecemos, de viles brutos, con instintos peores que las fieras).  On the other, \nblood flowed \u2018from noble Spanish breasts \u2013 soldiers and militiamen \u2013 generous youth, full of \nan abnegation and a heroism so immense that their wounds lift them to the status of the \ndemigods of Greek myth\u2019 (de hidalgos pechos espa\u00f1oles \u2013 militares y milicianos \u2013 j\u00f3venes \ngenerosos, llenos de abnegaci\u00f3n y de heroismo tan inmensos, que sus heridas los elevan a la \naltura de los semidios de las leyendas hel\u00e9nicas). P.5  Then he asked \u2018And all this horrific \nmortality, must it go without its just punishment?  Our spirit rebels against a possible \nimpunity of the pitiless individuals who caused our tragedy.  It is just not possible that \nProvidence and man leave without punishment so many murders, rapes, cruelties, pillages and \ndestructions of artistic wealth and the means of production.

For this it is necessary to flee all kind of \nintolerance and sectarianism, seeking inspiration only in equity and the benefit of all our \ncitizens. \u2026  For this ideal programme to come about, it is necessary to bring about the total \nextirpation of our enemies, of those front-line intellectuals who brought about the catastrophe\u2019 \n(lograr una vida justa, moral y encaminada a la fortaleza de la raza.  Para ello hay que huir de \ntoda clase de intolerancias y de sectarismos, inspir\u00e1ndose solamente en la equidad y en el \nbeneficio de todos los ciudadanos\u2026.  Para que este programa ideal pueda cumplirse, hace \nfalta practicar una extirpaci\u00f3n a fondo de nuestros enemigos, de esos intelectuales, en primera \nl\u00ednea, productores de la cat\u00e1strofe).102 \n \nThe desire to eliminate any intellectuals that could remotely have contributed to the liberal \nculture of the Republic led Su\u00f1er to send numerous denunciations to the rebel intelligence \nservice, the Servicio de Informaci\u00f3n Militar.  At the end of June 1937, he denounced the \nfamily of the distinguished medievalist and philologist Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal, President of \nthe Spanish Academy (Academia de la Lengua).  A conservative, Men\u00e9ndez Pidal was in \nexile, terrified of being the victim of the left.  Su\u00f1er also denounced Men\u00e9ndez Pidal\u2019s wife, \nthe feminist and philologist Mar\u00eda Goyri, who had been the first woman in Spain to earn a \nuniversity degree (1896) and later a doctorate (1909).  Su\u00f1er claimed that she had perverted \nher husband and children and was one of the most dangerous people in Spain \u2018de las personas \nm\u00e1s peligrosas de Espa\u00f1a.  Es sin duda una de las ra\u00edces m\u00e1s robustas de la revoluci\u00f3n\u2019.  He \ndenounced their son-in-law, the physicist Ram\u00f3n Catal\u00e1n, as a Communist and demanded that \nhe be placed under police surveillance.103 \n \nAfter the civil war, Gonzalo Aguilera went to London, possibly on some sort of \nespionage mission.  He regularly wrote articles on scientific subjects, especially the atom, for \nhis local Salamanca newspaper, La Gaceta Regional.   He retired from the army as a \nLieutenant Colonel and returned to his estates and his books.  He summarised his findings on \n                                                 \n101 Su\u00f1er, Los intelectuales, pp.166-7. \n102 Su\u00f1er, Los intelectuales, p.171. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n33 \nthe atom into a book.  He also wrote a set of \u2018letters to a nephew\u2019, a remarkably erudite \nmixture of oblique memoirs and philosophy written in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  The \nrange of reference was staggering, from the Osservatore Romano to the reports of the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, from Greek myth to Leibnitz 104  Their virulent \nanticlericalism confirmed the process of disenchantment with the Catholic Church that \napparently began on the Eastern front during the First World War.  Together with his savage \naccount of the golden age of Spanish history so dear to Francoist rhetoric, it also accounts for \nthe fact that they were not published.105  The work was riddled with signs that he found the \nreturn to civilian life extremely difficult.  It began bitterly with the statement that his life had \ntaken place in isolated meditation and surrounded by mistrust. He attributed this to \u2018la \ndesgracia de usualmente haber sabido m\u00e1s que el corro en que circunstancialmente nos \nencontr\u00e1bamos o por siempre haber manifestado el disgusto o menosprecio que nos produc\u00edan \nlas descabaladas opiniones de los osados y de los arbitristas\u2019 (\u2018the misfortune of having \nusually known more than the chorus in which we found ourselves and of always having \nexpressed the disgust or the contempt provoked in us by the half-formed opinions of the \ndaring and crackpots\u2019. He claimed to have been accused of being a rebel and unadaptable \nwhich he thought inevitable since he felt himself to be surrounded by \u2018de hipocres\u00eda, mentira, \nenvidias y chicaner\u00eda\u2019 (\u2018hypocrisy, lies, envy and trickery\u2019).  He was disgusted with the \npolitical context, feeling that the moral certainties of the war had been replaced by \ncompromise and the emasculation of \u2018principios firmes\u2019 (\u2018firm principles\u2019).  In a reference to \nhis retirement from the army in 1931 and his war service, he wrote: \u2018Toda la vida hemos \nprocurado servir a la Patria de balde y sin ulterior intenci\u00f3n de prebendas y emolumentos.  \nVarias veces por hacer frente a la corriente desorbitada y a la injusticia hemos afrontado \ngraves perjuicios propios y con la tristeza de no haber conseguido gran cosa.\u2019 (\u2018All my life, I \nhave tried to serve the Patria freely and without any ulterior motives of prebends or \nemoluments.  Several times, by dint of opposing the tide and injustice, I have faced serious \npersonal disadvantage and the sadness of not having achieved much.\u2019)  In this regard, he was \ndelighted that a friend had told him that he was \u2018m\u00e1s loco que don Quijote\u2019 (\u2018crazier than Don \nQuijote\u2019) for criticising the Catholic Church106 \n                                                                                                                                                        \n103 Diego Catal\u00e1n, El archivo del romancero: historia documentada de un siglo de historia (2 tomos) (Madrid: \nFundaci\u00f3n Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal, 2001) pp.256-9. \n104 They are undated but there are internal references to the international press which make it clear that he was \nwriting until, at least 1953, Cartas, pp.110, 123, note to p.126. \n105 He demolishes the Francoist glorification of Spanish history in Cartas, pp.151-76.  The work is informed by \nanticlericalism throughout but see especially nota del asterisco de la p\u00e1gina 218. \n106 Cartas, pp.1-2, 91. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n34 \n \nThe ideas with which he had regaled the members of the press corps in his charge \nduring the civil war were now refined.   He was profligate with extremely erudite references \nto Aristotle, Cicero, the fathers of the Church, a host of medieval philosophers, Calvin, \nGalileo, Spinoza and Descartes.  These were juxtaposed to bizarre statements such as the \nfollowing: \u2018lo que aqu\u00ed llamamos higiene pol\u00edtica es lo que los Ingleses dicen \u201cWisdom\u201d\u2019 (\u2018by \npolitical hygiene, I mean here what the English call wisdom\u2019) and \u2018la palabra revoluci\u00f3n es de \nsignificado esencialmente Sat\u00e1nico, el primer revolucionario en el mito cristiano fue Luzbel\u2019 \n(\u2018the word of revolution is of essentially Satanic significance since the first revolutionary was \nLucifer\u2019).107  He was particularly proud of his readings in English literature, philosophy and \nhistory, making ample reference to Shakespeare, Marlowe, Hume, Adam Smith, Gibbon, \nBuckle, Darwin, J.S.Mill, Bentham and George Bernard Shaw.  He made comparisons \nbetween the Spanish Inquisition and Soviet Communism, linking the Holy Office and the \nGPU.  This did not imply any softening of his views on communism \u2013 it remained \u2018la negra \nnube de Oriente\u2019 (\u2018the black cloud from the east\u2019) and \u2018inmenso tumor maligno\u2019 (\u2018immense \nmalignant tumour\u2019).  The problem was rather the communist elements of early christianity.108   \n \nIn politics, in the midst of a discussion on the relative merits of different races, he \nwrote of the \u2018patente superioridad\u2019 (\u2018patent superiority\u2019) of the white man.  In a variant on the \nracist ideas purveyed to Whitaker and his colleagues, he divided humanity into the \u2018Nordic-\nEuropean races\u2019 and \u2018the Afro-Asiatic masses\u2019, indicating that \u2018el estado centralista, como su \nnombre indica, es el m\u00e1s adecuado para regir los destinos de las masas inferiores\u2019 (\u2018the \ncentralist state, as its name suggests, is the most appropriate to rule over the destinies of \ninferior masses\u2019).  \u2018En \u00c1frica, con el sistema nervioso particular de la raza negra, en que las \nexcitaciones adquieren formas m\u00e1s o menos epil\u00e9pticas, solamente el ritmo continuado \nacompa\u00f1ado de un pandero o tambor produce unas formas m\u00edsticas extasiales muy curiosas y \ncomo son gentes simplistas su misticismo degenero en lubricidad sexual.\u2019 (\u2018In Africa, with \nthe nervous system peculiar to the black race, in which excitement acquires more or less \nepileptic forms, it requires only a continual rhythm accompanied by a tambourine or a drum \nto produce mystical forms of ecstasy, and since they are simplistic people, their mysticism \ndegenerates into sexual lubricity.\u2019)109  He was particularly interested in proving the \u2018las \n                                                 \n107 Cartas, p.6. \n108 Cartas, pp.32, 71, 97. \n109 Cartas, pp.66-8, 114. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n35 \nanormalidades sexuales en las gentes inclinadas al sacerdocio\u2019 (\u2018sexual abnormalities of \npeople inclined to the priesthood\u2019) and that \u2018al cristianismo siempre se han sentido atra\u00eddos las \nmujeres y los eunucos\u2019 (\u2018Christianity has always attracted women and eunuchs\u2019).  Misogyny \nabounded: he claimed that a woman who reached thirty still a virgin becomes a \u2018soltera agria, \nque para la tranquilidad de todos est\u00e1 mucho mejor detr\u00e1s de unas rejas de clausura\u2019 (\u2018bitter \nspinster who, for the peace of everyone else, is better behind the bars of a cloister\u2019).  Echoing \nhis remarks to Whitaker about a man\u2019s right to kill his wife, he wrote \u2018el adulterio toma \ncaracter\u00edsticas de crimen cuyo inmediato castigo con muerte de los culpables por el esposo \nultrajado ha sido aceptado como ley natural en todas las sociedades hasta que aparecen los \ns\u00edntomas decadentes de las civilizaciones.\u2019 (\u2018adultery is a crime whose immediate punishment \nby the death of the guilty pair at the hands of the outraged husband has always been accepted \nas the natural law in all societies until the appearance of the symptoms of the decadence of the \ncivilization\u2019.)  He also produced a defence of the chastity belt as a necessary weapon against \nfemale promiscuity, on which he blamed the degeneration of the race in terms of the \nintroduction of cancer, sexual perversion, mental instability and abnormal skin \npigmentation.110  The central theme was, however, anti-clericalism: \u2018ah\u00ed est\u00e1 nuestra Espa\u00f1a y \nlos pa\u00edses cristianos en que las \u00f3rdenes han ejercido casi un monopolio de la educaci\u00f3n y \ncuanto m\u00e1s en sus manos, mayor ha sido la decadencia material y \u00e9tica y m\u00e1s propensa la \ncorrupci\u00f3n\u2019 (\u2018in Spain and other Christian countries where the religious orders have exercised \na near monopoly of education, the more control they have had of education, the greater has \nbeen the material and ethical decadence and the greater the tendency to corruption.\u2019)111 \n \nGonzalo became a well-known \u2018character\u2019 in Salamanca.  He was an assiduous \nmember of a tertulia of doctors which used to meet at the Caf\u00e9 Novelty in the Plaza Mayor in \nSalamanca.  He would make the daily journey to the provincial capital on a motorcycle \nwearing a crash helmet and his uniform trousers.  He was considered to be a local eccentric.  \nAll the bookshops of Salamanca used to keep interesting new books for him on the reasonable \nassumption that he would buy them.  To the booksellers and the doctors alike, he was known \nfor his bottomless erudition.  Apart from the doctors, he had hardly any friends.  He had \nacquaintances among other landowners but none ever achieved any kind of closeness with \nhim.  His conversation was considered fascinating although his irritability did not encourage \nfriendship or intimacy of any kind.  He was spoke often of writing a book about \u2018a strange \n                                                 \n110 Cartas, pp.82-3, 88-9, 92-5. \n111 Cartas, pp.91 \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n36 \npersonage in Africa\u2019.112  He could not reconcile himself to civilian life and, as he got older, \nbecame increasingly difficult, abrasive and bad-tempered.  He neglected his estates and his \nhouse, both of which were badly run down. \n \nHe developed persecution mania.  His wife became so afraid of his violent rages that, \nin late 1963, for her own protection, she asked her two sons to come and live at home at the \nDehesa del Carrascal de Sanchiricones in Matilla de los Ca\u00f1os in the province of Salamanca.  \nThe elder, aged forty-seven, Gonzalo Aguilera Alvarez, was a retired cavalry captain.  He had \nfought in the Civil War and been badly wounded.  While in hospital, he had fallen in love \nwith Manuela Lodeiro, a nurse at the military hospital in Lugo.  In an echo of his own father\u2019s \nreaction to his relationship with the socially inferior Magdalena Alvarez, the Conde had \nreacted furiously and forbidden them to marry.  They did so anyway and settled in Lugo, \nwhere they had a daughter, Marianela.   The younger son, Agust\u00edn Aguilera Alvarez, a thirty-\nnine year-old farmer, also had a difficult relationship with his father.  Accordingly, he had \nsettled first in Zamora where had married Angelines N\u00fa\u00f1ez.  More recently, they had moved \nto J\u00e9rez de la Frontera with their two daughters and young son.  Knowing only too well the \nirascibility of their father, and despite the inconvenience for their own families, the two sons  \nagreed to their mother\u2019s request and spent as much time as possible in Sanchiricones watching \nover their father.   \n \nAfter a year, things had not improved.  The family reluctantly discussed having \nGonzalo declared mentally incapacitated and placing him in psychiatric care.  For fear of \nscandal and with a natural horror of seeing the head of the household declared insane, they \nhesitated.  Finally, they put the matter in the hands of a lawyer in Salamanca.  Given that \nGonzalo now suffered bronchial problems and rarely attended the tertulia in the caf\u00e9 in the \nPlaza Mayor, it was possible to fabricate the pretext of a visit of two medical friends in order \nto have him diagnosed.  A psychiatrist, Dr Prieto Aguirre, accompanied by another doctor, \nEmilio Firmat, came to the conclusion that Gonzalo was paranoiac.  He became so difficult \nthat his sons rearranged the house to provide him with a separate apartment with his own \ntelevision and his books. They hid all the many guns and knives, which, as an assiduous \nhunter, he possessed.  He believed himself to have been kidnapped and imprisoned by his \nfamily.  At the beginning of August 1964, he had even written a letter to this effect to the \n                                                 \n112 El Caso, 5 September 1964. \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n37 \njudicial authorities in Salamanca.  He had wild fits of rage, shouting threats and insults from \nhis solitary apartment.   He would occasionally find weapons and, in mid-August, his sons \ntook a flick-knife away from him.  The legal process to have him committed, however, was \nlengthy and tortuous. \n \nBefore anything could be done, Gonzalo completely lost his mind.  After lunch, at 4 \no\u2019clock on the sultry afternoon of Friday 28 August 1964, his younger son Agust\u00edn went into \nthe Count\u2019s room to look for some papers.  When his father complained of sore feet, Agust\u00edn \nknelt and started to massage his feet.  Bizarrely echoing his beliefs on how to deal with \nbootblacks, Don Gonzalo began to abuse his son, pulled out a rusty Colt revolver that he had \nhidden and shot Agust\u00edn without warning.  Badly wounded in the chest, Agust\u00edn turned and \nstaggered out of the room.  His brother Gonzalo, alerted by the sound of the shots, ran into the \nroom and the Conde shot him full in the chest and in the arm.  Stepping over his elder son\u2019s \ncorpse, he then set off in search of Agust\u00edn in order to finish him off.  He found him lying \ndead at the door of the kitchen.  He then calmly reloaded his revolver.  His widow, Magdalena \nAlvarez, aged seventy-two, came out of her room.  When she saw him glaring at her while \nreloading his pistol over the body of his son, she locked herself in another room as her \nhusband came looking for her.  Since the farm labourers stood back, frightened by the sight of \nGonzalo waving his revolver threateningly, she was obliged to escape through a window.  The \nCivil Guard was called by the estate workers and they ordered Gonzalo to throw down his gun \nand come out with his hands in the air, which, his fury spent, he did.  \n \nAfter surrendering, still in his pyjamas, he sat outside the house for more than three \nhours quietly awaiting the arrival of the investigating judge from Salamanca.  His wife, beside \nherself with grief and rage, screamed at him \u2018\u00a1Asesino, criminal!\u2019 (\u2018Assassin!  Murderer!\u2019)   \nUntil calmed down by the farm workers, she shouted to the Civil Guards, \u2018\u00a1Matarlo que es un \nsalvaje\u2019 (\u2018Kill him, he\u2019s a savage\u2019).  He was arrested and taken to the Provincial psychiatric \nsanatorium of Salamanca where he was detained.   He and his Civil Guard escort were taken \nto Salamanca in the car in which the reporters of the local newspaper, La Gaceta Regional, \nhad arrived at the house.  Those journalists who interviewed him recounted that, en route, he \nchatted amiably to the driver.  He spoke about various cars that he had had at different times, \nabout the traffic system established in France and about the poor state of the roads \u2013 \u2018hablo \npara no acordarme de lo sucedido\u2019  (\u2018I\u2019m talking to put what had happened out of my mind\u2019), \nhe said.  When he was told that he was being taken to a psychiatric clinic, he commented that \nSlaves, Sewers and Captain Aguilera: Racism, colonialism and sexism in the Mentality of the Nationalist Officer Corps                           \n38 \npsychiatrists are not usually in their right minds (en sus cabales) and said \u2018 a los que fueron a \nverme les llam\u00e9 m\u00e9dicos de pueblo y se enfadaron conmigo\u2019 (\u2018I called the ones that visited \nme village quacks and they got angry with me\u2019).113   During his time in the psychiatric \nhospital, he apparently entertained himself by loudly insulting the nuns who staffed it.114  His \ndaughter-in-law, Concepci\u00f3n Lodeiro L\u00f3pez, and granddaughter, Marianela de Aguilera \nLodeiro, escaped the carnage because they had gone to Lugo to make the arrangements for the \ngirl\u2019s wedding.  The wife and three children of Agust\u00edn were in southern Spain. Gonzalo \nnever stood trial and died in the hospital nearly eight months later on 15 May 1965.115 \n \nIt would be wrong to believe that Aguilera\u2019s earlier rantings were simply the fruit of \nthe extraordinary psychological disturbance which finally emerged in the tragic denouement \nof this family.  There is little doubt that he was utterly typical of others such as Bol\u00edn and \nRosales who had been chosen by Mola, and accepted by Franco, as appropriate spokesmen for \ntheir cause.  One officer had told Webb Miller that \u2018\u201cwe must kill everyone who has that \u2018red\u2019 \nidea.\u201d    Another amiable, attractive, intelligent young insurgent officer told me he had \nhimself executed seventy-one men.\u2019116  There is even less doubt that Aguilera\u2019s views were \nclose to those of Mola, Franco, Queipo de Llano and other senior Nationalists.   Rather than \nsimply concluding that Aguilera was mad, it would be more fruitful to consider the extent to \nwhich his \u2013 and their \u2013 psychological disturbance derives from the internalisation of such \nideas. \n \n                                                 \n113 Documentaci\u00f3n sobre Gonzalo de Aguilera y Munro, remitida a su viuda, Legajo 416, Archivo General \nMilitar de Segovia; El Adelanto (Salamanca), 29, 30 August, 1 September 1964; El Caso, 5 September 1964; La \nGaceta Regional, 30 August, 1 September 1964.   \n114 Testimony to the author, 30 July 1999, of the Cronista de la Ciudad de Salamanca, Dr Salvador Llopis Llopis, \nbiographer of In\u00e9s Luna Terrero. \n115 Interview of Mariano Sanz Gonz\u00e1lez with the Director of the Hospital, Dr Desiderio L\u00f3pez, 27 October 1999. \n116 Miller, I Found No Peace, p.344. \n"}
