There has been a strong trend towards convergence of \ncommunication services in recent times, with the Internet providing the ideal platform \non which to base such convergence. Even traditional circuit-switched applications \n(such as voice and video streaming) have been shown to work effectively over the \nInternet. Although the Internet is prevalent in the developed world, satellites are vital \nto extending this into more remote and sparsely populated regions of the world. It is \ntherefore important that satellite technology is advanced to provide seamless \ninteroperability with the Internet and adequate Quality of Service (QoS) support. The \npurpose of this special issue is to present research devoted to furthering satellite \ntechnology and networking to support the provision of both current and future \napplications. \n \nThe call for papers for this Special Issue has attracted fifteen submissions, originating \nfrom six European and two Asian countries, covering a wide range of topics related to \nsatellite systems, applications and networking. Each paper was carefully evaluated \nthrough the peer-review process and we subsequently selected eight high quality \nresearch papers to be included in this Special Issue. We believe that the selected \npapers will provide a thorough and useful insight into the latest developments for \nresearchers, engineers, and students interested in satellite communications. \n \nThe eight papers are divided into two categories. \n \nFour papers consider issues surrounding the deployment of broadband networks.   \n\u2018Broadband Satellite Multimedia\u2019 by Yim-Fun Hu et al. provides a comprehensive \nreview of standardisation activities associated with enabling the interoperability of IP \nbased protocols with satellite specific physical and link layer technologies. A flexible \nnetwork management architecture is presented which introduces business and \noperational support functions to allow satellites to effectively integrate with the \nInternet of the Future. \u2018A Medium Access Control Scheme for Supporting User \nMobility in DVB-RCS\/S2 \u2013 General Architecture and Functionalities\u2019 by Nedo \nCelandroni et al. describes an access scheme designed to support unicast multimedia \nservices over satellite in a mobile environment, compatible with DVB-RCS\/S2. \nSimulation results show the relative merits of random access and contention-free \naccess for short transfers and long-lived connections with mobile vehicles as clients \nand servers. \u2018Delivering Triple Play Services over Broadband Satellite Networks\u2019 by \nGorry Fairhurst et al. proposes an extended DVB-RCS architecture to support \nadvanced IP-oriented multimedia, through a QoS subsystem based upon appropriate \nclassification and scheduling of different traffic types. Results demonstrate that triple \nplay services can be supported with acceptable performance over a DVB-RCS system.  \n\u2018Feasibility Analysis of Zero-Overhead nVOD Protocols in Satellite Channels\u2019 by \nHector Cerezo-Costas et al. investigates the use of near Video-on-Demand protocols \nwith error correction capability over satellite channels. The benefits of satellite \nsystems for video distribution are explored. Alternative error correction methods are \ncompared in terms of their error correction performance and resource consumption at \nthe client and server. \n \nFour papers focus on routing and traffic control issues.  \n \n\u2018Routing Metrics for Store and Forward Satellite Constellations\u2019 by Hugo Cruz \nS\u00e1nchez and Laurent Franck argues the case for a new approach to characterising the \nperformance of routing computation when applied to store-and-forward networks. \nBeginning with a review of the classical metrics that are used to define routing \nperformance, the authors proceed to develop a new set of routing metrics specifically \ndesigned for store-and-forward networks. Simulation of a low earth orbit satellite \nconstellation operating in store-and-forward mode is used to analyse the performance \nof the proposed routing metrics. \u2018QoE in Multicast Hybrid Networks: Avoiding \nBandwidth Wasting with a Double Stage FEC Scheme\u2019 by Paolo Barsocchi and \nGabriele Oligeri addresses the challenge of providing quality of experience (QoE) to \nthe end-user for video streaming applications delivered via a hybrid satellite and \nterrestrial wireless network. A two-stage forward error recovery scheme is shown via \nsimulation to improve system performance and bandwidth efficiency in comparison to \nestablished techniques.  \u2018Linear Quadratic Control of Service Rate Allocation in a \nSatellite Network\u2019 by Raffaello Secchi et al. develops an approach based on linear \nquadratic optimal control theory to allocating bandwidth to independent traffic queues \nsharing a limited available bandwidth at a satellite master station by making use of \nreal-time instantaneous or delayed information on the queues\u2019 state. A simulated \ngeostationary satellite scenario employing Digital Video Broadcast \u2013 Return Channel \nvia Satellite (DVB-RCS) is used to test the approach.   \u2018Satellite Constellation \nNetworks for Aeronautical Communication: Traffic Modeling and Link Load \nAnalysis\u2019 by Anton Donner et al. considers the use of non-geostationary satellite \nconstellations employing inter-satellite links (ISLs) for the provision of air traffic \ncontrol and air passenger communication services. Following the modelling of \nmultiservice traffic and aircraft movement using actual flight data, two policies for \nrouting are analysed based on minimising handovers and the number of hops within \nthe ISL segment, respectively.  \n \nWe would like to thank Prof. Habib F. Rashvand (Editor-in-Chief) and Mr. Paul \nRowley for their excellent support in preparing this Special Issue. It has been a \npleasure working with them. We are very grateful to the reviewers for taking time to \nprovide considered reviews, and would also like to thank all the authors who \nsubmitted their work for consideration in this Special Issue. \n \nWe hope readers enjoy reading the following high quality papers that address satellite \nsystems, applications and networking. \n \n \nPAUL D.
