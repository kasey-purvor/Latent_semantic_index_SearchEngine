ITs are defined as the \u201ccollective \nterm given to the most recent developments in the mode (electronic) and the mechanisms computers \nand communication technologies) used for the acquisition, processing analysis, storage, retrieval, \ndissemination and application of information1. At the macroeconomic level, ITs become instrumental \nin the development and prosperity of regions, as they determine their competitiveness in the global \nmarketplace. At the microeconomic level, ITs prevail all functions of strategic and operational \nmanagement and impel the competitiveness of enterprises.  \n \nThe enhancements in ITs' processing power in the last decade revolutionise their capabilities as they \nconstantly increase computing speed; decrease equipment size; reduce hardware and software \ncosts; and improve the reliability, compatibility and inter-connectivity of numerous terminals and \napplications. A great degree of innovation is incorporated in hardware, software and network \ndevelopments, whilst intellect becomes a critical asset in ITs\u2019 management. Paradoxically, the more \npowerful and complicated ITs become, the more user-friendly and inexpensive they are, enabling \nmore people and organisations to take advantage. Hence, Hopper2 proposes that \"in the \nnot-so-distant future, computers will be as familiar part of the business environment as telephones \nare today. They will also be as simple to use as telephones or at least nearly so\". The emergent \ninformation society and the knowledge-based economic powers will therefore redefine the ability of \nregions and enterprises to prosper in the new millennium.3\nInevitably the tourism industry is also affected by the technological revolution. Both tourism \ndestinations and enterprises increasingly need to adopt innovative methods and to enhance their \ncompetitiveness. On the demand side, the new, sophisticated, knowledgeable and demanding \nconsumer increasingly becomes familiar with the emergent ITs and requires flexible, specialised, \naccessible, interactive products and communication with principals. Hence, new best management \npractices emerge, taking advantage of the ITs revolution and re-engineering the entire business \nprocesses of the industry. This paper aims to analyse some of the most critical IT developments and \nto demonstrate how they influence the tourism industry. It blends the theoretical background of ITs \nwith the strategic functions of the industry and proposes a multi-dimensional framework for the \nincorporation of ITs in tourism. \n \nInformation Technologiess As A Major Contributor To Competitiveness And Competitive \nAdvantage\nThe fusion of ITs provides unprecedented tools, which facilitate the creation of new industries, \nrestructure existing industries and radically change the way firms and regions compete. ITs reshape \nthe nature of competition in most economic activities, whilst they link consumers and suppliers, \nadding value to organisations' products. Hence, ITs change the competitive game for almost all \norganisations, regardless the industry they operate in, their location or size.4-6 In particular, \ntechnology affects competitive advantage as it determines the relative cost position or differentiation \nof organisations.7 A firm can achieve several strategic benefits by using ITs, namely: establishing \nentry barriers; affecting switching costs; differentiating products\/services; limiting access to \ndistribution channels; ensuring competitive pricing; decreasing supply costs and easing supply; \nincreasing cost efficiency; using information as a product itself; and building closer relationships with \nsuppliers and customers.8\nTable 1 illustrates the results of the latest annual Manufacturing Attitudes Survey. Manufacturers not \nonly regard investments on ITs as crucial in enabling them to outperform competitors, but also their \nexpectations from IT systems go far beyond their operational management and focus primarily on \nthe strategic management of enterprises. As information is a source of power in negotiations with \npartners, the adoption of ITs often redefines the power balance between partners, and changes their \nbargaining relationships.9 Perhaps, small and medium sized enterprises gain more advantages by \n2using ITs, as bargaining power is gradually relocated from institutional buyers and wholesalers to \nsuppliers, due to the more effective and interactive communication they can achieve with their target \nmarkets. Small size in combination with innovation and effective networking by using ITs also \nenables them to develop \u201cvirtual size\u201d and empowers their competitiveness. Smaller firms can \ntherefore develop and deliver the right product, to the right customer, at the right price and place, \nwithout over-depending on intermediaries. This would enable small firms to enhance their position \nand increase their profit margin.  \n \nTable 1 Impact of information technologies on businesses \n \nSignificantly enhance competitive edge  79% \nImproves information      77% \nBetter external communications   65% \nManage computers expectations better   63% \nImprove decision making process   61% \n \nSource: (10) Conspectus, August 1996, p.42. \n \nHence, ITs offer new management and business opportunities and can be applied strategically in at \nleast four different ways: gain a competitive advantage; improve productivity and performance; \nfacilitate new ways of managing and organising; and develop new businesses.8 Ultimately, firms \ninvesting in ITs attempt to gain a competitive advantage by lowering their cost or by improving \ncustomers' perception about the quality of their products and services, and hence differentiating their \noffering.7-9 \nPrerequisites For Achieving Competitive Advantages Through Information Technologies\nDespite the potential benefits, ITs do not guarantee profitability and they may even worsen the \ncompetitive position of firms and the attractiveness of an industry.7 There is also a debate on whether \nITs-originated competitive advantage can be sustained, as investments in technology are often \nmatched by competitors. Strassmann11 suggests that there is no significant correlation between \nspending on ITs and profitability. There is also criticism that ITs often fail to add value in an \norganisation's operation, whilst the costs associated (capital, training, staff) sometimes exceed the \nbenefits generated.12-13 This is often attributed to the lack of long term ITs vision, which deters \nenterprises from capitalising on opportunities and gaining benefits. ITs are not a panacea and in fact \nincorporate several risks as well as considerable costs. Organisations should therefore realise that \nITs contribute to both sides of the general business equation, since they add to both revenue and \ncost streams.  \n \nHowever, ignoring and under-utilising ITs could be disastrous as it would create strategic vulnerability \nand competitive disadvantage.4 Thus, no action is not an option. ITs can be fruitful, only if certain \nprerequisites are satisfied, namely: long term planning and strategy; innovative business processes \nre-engineering; top management commitment; and training throughout the hierarchy. Using ITs as a \nstand-alone initiative is inappropriate. Their usage has to be coupled with the re-engineering of all \nbusiness processes as well as with a redesign of organisational structures and control systems. \nPerhaps the greatest challenge is to identify and train managers who will be effective and innovative \nusers of ITs and would lead technology-based decision making towards quantifiable gains and \nadvantages. Intellect, therefore, becomes one of the major assets of organisations, while continuous \neducation and training are the only methods to develop and maintain this asset. Provided that \nrational and innovative planning and management is exercised constantly and consistently, ITs can \nsupport the success of organisations.14-16 \nTOURISM AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES\n3Tourism is inevitably influenced by the business process re-engineering experienced due to the \ntechnological revolution. As information is the life-blood of the travel industry, effective use of ITs is \npivotal. Hence, \"a whole system of ITs is being rapidly diffused throughout the tourism industry and \nno player will escape its impacts\".1 Unlike durable goods, intangible tourism services cannot be \nphysically displayed or inspected at the point of sale before purchasing. They are bought before the \ntime of their use and away from the place of consumption. Hence they depend exclusively upon \nrepresentations and descriptions, provided by the travel trade, (e.g. information in brochures), for \ntheir ability to attract consumers. Timely and accurate information, relevant to consumers' needs, is \noften the key to satisfaction of tourist demand. Therefore, ITs provide the information backbone that \nfacilitates tourism .17 \nThe revolution of ITs has profound implications for the management of the tourism industry, mainly \nby enabling efficient co-operation within the industry and by offering tools for globalisation. In few \nother economic activities are the generation, gathering, processing, application and communication \nof information as important for day-to-day operations. The rapid development of both supply and \ndemand makes ITs an imperative partner and thus they increasingly play a more critical role in \ntourism marketing, distribution, promotion and co-ordination. The re-engineering of these processes \ngenerates a paradigm-shift altering the structure of the entire industry.18-24 Thus, ITs have a dramatic \nimpact on the travel industry, because they force the sector to rethink the way in which it organises \nits business, its values or norms of behaviour and the way in which it educates its workforce. 25 \nInformation Technologies And Tourism Demand\nWTO argues that \"the key to success lies in the quick identification of consumer needs and in \nreaching potential clients with comprehensive, personalised and up-to-date information\".26 The rapid \ngrowth of both the volume and the quality requirements of contemporary travellers, require powerful \nITs for the administration of the expanding traffic. Tourists become sophisticated and more \ndemanding, requesting high quality products and value for their money. Thus, destinations and \nprincipals need new methods to serve the new types of demand. The usage of ITs in the industry is \ndriven by both the development of the size and complexity of tourism demand, as well as by the rapid \nexpansion and sophistication of new tourism products, which address mini-market segments. \nIncreasingly, new, experienced, sophisticated, demanding travellers seek information about more \nexotic destinations and authentic experiences, as well as require to interact with suppliers in order to \nsatisfy their specific needs and wishes. The contemporary\/connected consumer \"is far less willing to \nwait or put up with delays, to the point where patience is a disappearing virtue\".27 \nIn order to satisfy tourism demand and survive in the long term there is no choice but to incorporate \ntechnology and enhance the interactivity with the marketplace.23, 26-27 Increasingly, ITs enable \ntravellers to access reliable and accurate information as well as to undertake reservations in a \nfraction of time, cost and inconvenience required by conventional methods. ITs improve the service \nquality and contribute to higher guest\/traveller satisfaction. Customer satisfaction depends highly on \nthe accuracy and comprehensiveness of specific information on destinations' accessibility, facilities, \nattractions and activities.28-30 This is because the gap between consumers\u2019 expectations and \nperceived experiences is smaller and thus, unpleasant surprises from the destination or principals \nare minimised.21 In addition, several other ITs facilitated factors enhance consumer satisfaction, \nnamely: consumers have more information and enjoy a greater choice; a reduction of the \nbureaucracy and paper-work effectively frees time for customer service; customising the product and \nestablishing \u201cone-to-one\u201d marketing by using intelligence collected by loyalty schemes (e.g. dietary \nrequirements, product preferences); providing new services, (e.g. as in-flight or in-room \nentertainment and information channels); facilitating operational tasks (e.g. in-room TV checkout) ; \npersonalised services (e.g. telephone operator acknowledges guest by his name); and finally better \nintegration of departments and functions of organisations towards better service. \n \nComputer Reservation Systems (CRSs) and increasingly Internet providers satisfy the needs of \nconsumer for convenient access to transparent and easy to compare information. They cover the \n4entire variety of choices of travel, lodging and leisure services, destinations, holiday packages, as \nwell as display the actual prices and availability of such services. These services also provide \nimmediate confirmation and speedy documentation of reservations, allowing a greater degree of \nflexibility and enabling prospective travellers to book at the \"last minute\". Experienced travellers are \ntherefore empowered by information and booking systems and increase their personal efficiency by \ncreating tailor-made products independently. ITs also assist principals to understand consumer \nneeds through marketing research and loyalty\/partnership schemes. Improved access to information \ncovering all aspects of tourist activities provides the framework for offering personalised services at \nprice levels comparable to those of standard packages.31-33 \nThe revolutionary developments in ITs, which have been experienced through the proliferation of the \nInternet and the World Wide Web since 1995, illustrate that consumers increasingly rely on the \nInternet for travel information. They utilise commercial and non-commercial Internet sites for \nplanning, searching, purchasing and amending their travel. Non-tourism organisations tend to seize \nthe emergent opportunity by utilising the ITs tools. This is already the case with major ITs providers, \n(e.g. Microsoft developed Expedia, an electronic travel agency) to satisfy tourism demand. \n \nThe Re-Engineering Of The Tourism Production And Distribution\nThe impacts of ITs are evident in the tourism production, marketing, distribution and operational \nfunctions of both the private and public sectors.34 ITs can also boost staff morale, managerial \neffectiveness, productivity and ultimately profitability of tourism organisations, provided that \nmanagerial attitude is adapted to the new business environment and takes advantage of the \nemergent opportunities.35 In particular, ITs have pivotal implications for the distribution channel, as \nthey introduce unprecedented and innovative methods. Distribution is one of the few elements of the \nmarketing mix, which can still enable tourism enterprises to improve their competitiveness and \nperformance. Distributing the right marketing mix, to the right segments, through the right \nintermediaries, will be instrumental for the long-term success of principals. ITs not only facilitate \ndistribution, but they also enable differentiation and\/or cost advantage, as well as empower \ninteractive communication between principals and target markets. This is accomplished by re-\nengineering the entire processes of producing and delivering products, in order to optimise efficiency \nand productivity, and to maximise the value-added provided to consumers.20 \nThe evolution of ITs demonstrated that destinations and principals will be unable to compete \neffectively, unless they were able to promote themselves in the emergent electronic distribution \nchannels. ITs transformed distribution to an electronic marketplace, where access to information and \nubiquity is achieved, while interactivity between principals and consumers is empowered. Three main \nwaves of technological developments established ITs in tourism enterprises, namely Computer \nReservations Systems (CRSs) in the 1970s; Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) in the 1980s and \nthe Internet in the 1990s. Although these technologies emerged with gaps of about 10 years from \neach other, they currently operate both separately and jointly, controlling different functions and \ntarget markets.  \n \nComputer Reservation Systems (CRSs)\nComputerised networks and electronic distribution in tourism emerged in the early 1970s, through \ninternal CRSs. They became central to the distribution mix and strategy of airlines. CRSs are widely \nregarded as the critical initiators of the electronic age, as they formulated a new travel marketing and \ndistribution system. A CRS is essentially a database which manages the inventory of a tourism \nenterprise, whilst it distributes it electronically to remote sales offices and external partners. \nIntermediaries and consumers can access the inventory and they can make and confirm \nreservations. The rapid growth of both demand and supply, as well as the deregulation of the \nAmerican air transportation demonstrated that the tourism inventory could only be managed by \n5powerful computerised systems. Airlines pioneered this technology, although hotel chains and tour \noperators followed by developing CRSs.2, 33 \nCRSs enable principals to control, promote and sell their products globally, while facilitating their yield \nmanagement. In addition, they integrate the entire range of business functions, and thus can \ncontribute to principals\u2019 profitability and long term prosperity. CRSs often charge competitive \ncommission rates in comparison with other distribution options, whilst enabling flexible pricing and \ncapacity alterations in order to adjust supply to demand fluctuations. CRSs also reduce \ncommunication costs, while providing intelligence information on demand patterns or the position of \npartners and competitors. Hence, CRSs contribute enormously to both the operational and strategic \nmanagement of the industry.36-38 \n \nGlobal Distribution Systems (GDSs)\nSince the mid 1980s, airline CRSs have emerged into Global Distribution Systems (GDSs), by \ngradually expanding their geographical coverage, as well as by integrating both horizontally (with \nother airline systems) and vertically (by incorporating the entire range of tourism products and \nservices, such as accommodation, car rentals, train and ferry ticketing, entertainment and other \nprovisions). To avoid unnecessary over-lappings principals integrated their CRSs with GDSs, by \ndeveloping interfaces. Several \"switch\" companies, such as THISCO and WIZCOM, emerged to \nfacilitate interconnectivity.17 This enabled the display and purchasing of the majority of tourism \nproducts on-line. As GDSs connect most tourism organisations with intermediaries around the world, \nthey lead the standardisation processes and control a considerable market share.  \nGDSs emerged as the \"circulation system\" or the \"backbone\" of the industry by establishing a global \ncommunication standard and a new tourism electronic distribution channel. Evidently GDSs became \nbusinesses in their own right, as they changed their nature from tools for vendor airlines and \naccommodation corporations, to \"electronic travel supermarkets\" and strategic business units for \ntheir corporations.2,33,30 However, fierce competition forced a number of mergers and acquisitions in \nthe GDS industry. It is predicted that only two or three of the major ten GDSs will survive and \ntherefore, further concentration and integration is anticipated. Currently four systems, namely \nGalileo, Amadeus, Sabre and Worldspan, dominate the global market. Since GDSs are connected \nwith most major principals, they offer similar services. In June 1996, for example, Amadeus \ndisplayed availability for 432 airlines, 29,000 hotels and 55 car rental companies through 162,329 \nterminals in 106,394 travel agencies around the world.39 However, each GDS has a stronger market \nshare at the region where its parent airlines operate, as traditional links with travel agencies have \nbeen utilised for the penetration of GDSs. Table 2 illustrates the number of GDSs' locations and \nterminals in Europe, where each of the major GDSs are used.36-41 \nGDSs increasingly offer both leisure and business products, by providing information and allowing \nreservations for theatre tickets, holiday packages and tourism destinations. Eventually core GDSs \nare expected to be based on a network of smaller, regional and specialised computerised systems \nfor their leisure products. The development of Destination Management Systems will enable small \nand medium sized tourism enterprises to be represented.30, 42 Diverting into the leisure market \nresponds to demand trends, while enabling GDSs to diversify their portfolio in order to take \nadvantage of their technological infrastructure and network as well as economies of scale. This will \nassist them to deliver diversified services to broader markets and therefore suffer less from their \nbusiness market saturation.43-47 \nGDSs' efficiency and reliability enable principals to distribute and manage their reservations globally, \nby bridging consumer needs with the tourism supply. Hence, great synergies are achieved, where \nglobalisation drivers stimulate GDS developments and vice versa. Go48 identifies four major sets of \nconditions, namely, cost, market, government and competitive drivers (Table 3), and demonstrates \nwhy the globalisation of the tourism industry is closely interrelated with its ability to use computerised \nsystems. Ultimately GDSs should aim to increase the satisfaction of their stakeholders, (i.e. \nconsumers, principals, travel agencies and shareholders), offer superior products and enable \n6partners to maximise their profitability. \n7Table 2 Penetration and market shares of Global Distribution Systems in European travel agencies\nGerman\ny\nFrance Spain Denmar\nk\nUK Italy Hollan\nd\nBelgiu\nm\nPortuga\nl\nGreece Ireland Luxembourg Total\nAgencies\nAmadeus 11000 3150 2291 188 20 0 0 100 11 0 0 0 16760\nGalileo 200 124 101 22 2185 2384 403 158 350 84 47 0 6058\nSabre 600 358 91 21 624 518 79 96 1 178 17 13 2596\nWorldspan 300 150 100 90 500 180 200 150 160 120 30 0 1980\nTotal outlets 12100 3782 2583 321 3329 3082 682 504 522 382 94 13 27394\nTerminals\nAmadeus 23000 7200 3661 1275 60 0 0 388 11 0 0 0 35595\nGalileo 400 250 111 115 9421 5267 2100 438 554 88 211 0 18955\nSabre 1300 774 167 77 2251 960 167 280 1 224 45 26 6272\nWorldspan 1000 700 110 180 950 280 600 500 200 150 40 0 4710\nTotal terminals 25700 8924 4049 1647 12682 6507 2867 1606 766 462 296 26 65532\nTerminals per\noutlet\n2.12 2.36 1.57 5.13 3.81 2.11 4.20 3.18 1.46 1.21 3.15 2.00 2.39\nSource: Adapted from (49) Smith and Jenner, 1994,p.62 and (39) Hyde,1992, p.26-27.\nNote: [Terminals per outlet = Total terminals\/Total outlets]\nAs travel agencies might operate more than one Global Distribution Systems,\nthe \"terminals per outlet\" ratio is provided only for comparison reasons between countries.\n8Table 3 Computer Reservation Systems and Global Distribution Systems  \n as drivers for tourism and hospitality globalisation \nCost drivers \n\u2022 Increase efficiency \n \u2022 Low distribution cost \n \u2022 Low communication cost \n \u2022 Low labour cost \n \u2022 Minimisation of waste factor \n \u2022 Facilitator of flexible pricing \n \nMarket drivers \n\u2022 Satisfy sophisticated demand \n \u2022 Flexibility in time of operation \n \u2022 Support specialisation and differentiation \n \u2022 Provide last minute deals \n \u2022 Accurate information \n \u2022 Support relationship marketing \n strategies for frequent flyers\/guests \n \u2022 Quick reaction to demand fluctuation \n \u2022 Multiple\/integrated products \n \u2022 Yield management \n \u2022 Corporate intelligence  \n \u2022 Marketing research \n \nGovernment and regulatory drivers \n\u2022 Deregulation \n \u2022 Liberalisation \n \u2022 Government supported \nCompetitive drivers \n\u2022 Managing networks of enterprises \n \u2022 Value-added skill building \n \u2022 Flexibility \n \u2022 Knowledge acquisition \n \u2022 Strategic tool \n \u2022 Barrier to entry \n \nSource: Adapted from (48) Go, 1992, p.23-24. \n \nThe emerging super highway - the Internet and the World Wide Web \nThe Internet (or the \"Information Superhighway\") convergence media, telecommunications, and \ninformation technology, increases the interactivity between consumers and suppliers50. Since the \nearly 1990s, the World Wide Web (WWW) has emerged as the fastest growing area of the Internet, \nenabling distribution of multimedia information. As textual data, graphics, pictures, video, and sounds \nare easily accessible through the WWW, it soon became the flagship of the ITs' revolution and \ninstituted an innovative platform for efficient, live and timely exchange of both ideas and products. \nConsequently, unprecedented and unforeseen implications are drawn for the future of tourism \nmarketing and consumer behaviour. Although there is no accurate estimate of Internet users or sites, \nthe pace of the Web development demonstrates the role it will play in peoples' lives.  \n \nNew practices such as home shopping, tele-entertainment, tele-working, tele-learning and tele-\nbanking are expected to change everyday activities. Eventually consumers will live in \"electronic \nhouses\" or \"intelligent homes\" and will be served by \"virtual enterprises\" through a very interactive \ncommunication framework. The Internet also influences political life, as it introduces a democratic, \ntransparent, uncontrollable and difficult to dominate way of communication, where everyone is more \nor less able to broadcast their views regardless of hierarchical rankings and political power. \nHawkins51 suggests that \"business and organisations world-wide are realising that marketing on the \nWeb is multi-dimensional content marketing that requires the following paradigm shifts: from \ntraditional advertising to interactive marketing; and from developing and managing one way \ninformation flows to computer-mediated empowerment of users, consumers, and entrepreneurs who \nwill be engaged in electronic commerce in the information age\".  \n9Encouragingly, the tourism industry launched several services to take advantage of the information \nsuperhighway. Table 4 illustrates a number of tourism organisations represented on the Internet. The \nInternet and the WWW provide unprecedented opportunities for the industry as they bridge the gap \nbetween consumers and suppliers and empower closer interaction. The WWW provides an \nextremely vital service by incorporating similarly structured information and enabling the packaging of \na wide range of diverse products and services. ITs also provide the infrastructure for inexpensive \ndelivery of multimedia information, promotion and distribution for both principals and destinations.52-54 \nITs also assist the provision of tailored made products in order to meet the needs of individual \nconsumers, and as a consequence, they are expected to become instrumental in differentiating \ntourism supply. The Internet can also strengthen the marketing and communication functions of \nremote, peripheral and insular destinations as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, by \nempowering their direct communication with prospective customers as well as by assisting the \ndistribution process.21,30,55 Hence, the rapid development of the Internet and the WWW provide \nunprecedented and affordable opportunities for the global representation and marketing of tourism. \nNevertheless, the information currently available on the Internet is often chaotic and misleading, \nmainly due to its immaturity and lack of any type of standardisation. Several issues need to be \naddressed, namely: security of transmissions; credibility of information; intellectual property and \ncopyrights; bandwidth and speed limitations; user confusion and dissatisfaction; lack of adequate \ntrained specialists; equal access and pricing.56-60 \n10 \nTable 4 Representation Of Tourism Enterprises And Organisations On The Internet \nAirlines Uniform

August 1996. \n12 \nIt is anticipated that GDSs will eventually take advantage of the openness of the Internet and develop \nsuitable interfaces for consumers and the industry. Sabre has already launched Travelocity while \nother GDSs have announced similar actions.62 The Internet will empower GDSs to attract both \ninstitutional and individual consumers, whilst it will increase their productivity and efficiency. \nDistributed multimedia technologies in combination with the reservation capabilities would also \nprovide a powerful selling tool for the industry, while they would contribute to the training of travel \nconsultants. GDSs are also expected to become user-friendly, despite their concern that an easily \noperated system will make them easily replaceable. As a result, GDSs or third party providers are \nexpected to use the Internet in order to offer innovative interfaces for direct communication with \nconsumers, enhancing the home travel shopping opportunities.52-54 \n \nThe re-engineering of travel intermediation: theats and opportunities \nThe Internet is also anticipated to change the role of tourism intermediaries, and travel agencies in \nparticular. Hitherto, travel agencies have been the major brokers of tourism services and the \ninterface of the industry with consumers. However, to the degree that the Internet empowers \nconsumers to develop and purchase their own itineraries, travel agencies\u2019 future becomes \nquestionable. This is also reinforced by the recent commission capping by airlines around the \nworld. Table 5 demonstrates the most prominent arguments for and against disintermediation of \nthe tourism distribution channel. Future intermediation of the tourism distribution channel will \ntherefore be quite different from the current situation. There are several trends evident already:  \n \n\u2022 Traditional intermediaries reengineer their processes in order to up-date their offering, improve \ncustomer satisfaction and remain competitive 24 \n\u2022 New electronic intermediaries emerge (e.g. Expedia, ITN) to take advantage of the ITs\u2019 revolution \n\u2022 Tourism destinations develop regional systems to enhance their representation, boost their \nimage and attract direct bookings  20,30  \n\u2022 Principals develop Internet-based interfaces with consumers52 \nIn reality different market segments will use dissimilar distribution channels for selecting and \npurchasing their tourism products. For example, older generations and people who travel infrequently \nwill probably continue purchasing tourism products from traditional travel agencies. However, \nbusiness and frequent travellers may use on-line providers to arrange their itineraries and eventually \npurchase their tickets. This will depend on the security of Internet transactions; the reliability and \nquality of information available on the Internet; and the convenience of the entire process. \n \n13 \nTable 5 Arguments for and against the disintermediation of the tourism distribution channel \nArguments for the disintermediation of the tourism distribution channel \n\u2022 Travel agencies add little value to the tourism product, as they primarily act as \nbooking offices \n\u2022 Travel agencies merely manage information and undertake reservations \n\u2022 Travel agencies are biased, in favour of principals who offer override commissions \nand in-house partners \n\u2022 Experienced travellers are much more knowledgeable that travel agencies  \n\u2022 Visiting travel agencies is inconvenient, time consuming and restricted to office hours \n\u2022 Commissions to travel agencies increase the total price of travel products ultimately \n\u2022 Personnel in travel agencies are often inadequately trained and experienced \n\u2022 There is an increase of independent holidays and a decrease of package holidays  \n\u2022 Technology enables consumers to undertake most functions from the convenience of \ntheir armchair \n\u2022 Electronic travel intermediaries offer a great flexibility and more choice \n\u2022 The re-engineering of the tourism industry (e.g. electronic ticketing; now frills airlines; \nairline commission capping; loyalty schemes) facilitates disintermediation \n \nArguments against the disintermediation of the tourism distribution channel \n\u2022 Travel agencies are professional travel advisers and they offer valuable services and \nadvice \n\u2022 Travel agencies use expertise to save time for consumers  \n\u2022 Technology is difficult to use and expensive to acquire for individuals \n\u2022 A large part of the market is computer illiterate \n\u2022 The more complex computers and the Internet become, the more people need \nexperts to use them \n\u2022 Travel agencies offer free counselling services and add value by giving advice \n\u2022 Electronic intermediaries primarily serve the business market and are more \nexpensive \n\u2022 Travel agencies can achieve better prices through the right channels and deals \n\u2022 Travel agencies offer a human touch and a human interface with the industry \n\u2022 Travel agencies reduce the insecurity of travel, as they are responsible for all \narrangements \n\u2022 Travel agencies can offer better prices by buying in bulk or through consolidators  \n\u2022 Internet transactions are not secured and reliable yet \n \nTraditional travel agencies, therefore, will need to re-assess the situation and decide which market \nsegment they would like to concentrate on. Adequate equipment, training and service will be of \nparamount importance in order to maintain their competitiveness in the long term. Travel agencies \nwill need to transform from booking offices to travel managers and advisers, as well as to add value \nto the travelling experience. Two strategic directions can therefore be followed: Travel agencies can \neither offer differentiation value, by designing high quality personalised travel arrangements which \nconsumers will be willing to pay a premium for, or they can offer cost value by delivering less \nexpensive products than competitors, through standardisation, high volume and consolidators. These \ntwo strategies will probably dominate the travel industry in the future years. \n \nA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR ITs IN TOURISM\nA conceptual synthesis of the usage of ITs in business strategy and in tourism demand and supply in \nparticular yields a strategic ITs framework. This framework attempts to systematise our \n14 \nunderstanding of the use of ITs in tourism and to illustrate all strategic implications for the industry. \nFigure 1 demonstrates the multi-dimensional character of the framework, as well as the technologies \nit utilises in order to perform its business functions. Table 6 also illustrates several examples of the \ntourism industry functions undertaken within this framework. The ability of principals and destinations \nto use this framework effectively will increasingly determine their future competitiveness. The \nframework incorporates the paradigm shift and the business process re-engineering experienced, \nwhich effectively reshape the tourism industry. ITs propel changes in several directions between the \nthree main axes. The combinations originated illustrate how strategic marketing and management \ncan be utilised in order to achieve mutual benefits for all stakeholders in a tourism value-added \nproduction chain. An ITs-led integration of industry members is therefore evident and is expected to \ndominate the industry in the near future. \n \n\u0002 Intra-organisational functions \nITs enhance a number of intra-organisational processes, by supporting a certain level of integration \nbetween various functions within organisations; typically the \"front\" and \"back\" office. The aim is to \nincrease efficiency and productivity, as well as to enhance the strategic and operational management \nof the enterprise. Examples from the tourism industry include Property Management Systems or \nHotel Information Systems in hotels; integrated Points Of Sales systems; Management and Strategic \nInformation Systems; accounting and payroll systems; food production technology; inventory control \nfor tour operators, transportation companies and other principals. Intranet technology facilitates an \ninternal network by deploying the same technology and presentation tools as the Internet, but \nrestricting access to authorised personnel only. The future growth of Intranets will be rapid. It is \nestimated that two-thirds of all large companies either have or soon will have an Intranet. Sun63 \nestimates that world-wide server spend in 1997 on Intranets was around $6bn, compared with $3bn \non the Internet, while they expect it to reach $8bn by 1998. For years \"ITs managers have been \nlooking for a better way to deliver information within the organisation; now almost overnight the Web \nhas opened the door\". \n \n15\nFigure 1: Tourism and information technologies strategic framework\n16 \nTable 6 Tourism industry communication patterns and functions facilitated by ITs \nIntra-organisational communications & \nfunctions \n\u2022 Within a tourism organisation \n \n\u2022 Management \n strategic planning \n competition analysis \n financial planning and control \n marketing research \n marketing strategy & \nimplementation \n pricing decision and tactics \n middle term planning & \nfeedback \n management \nstatistics\/reports \n operational control \n management functions \n \n\u2022 Communication between \ndepartments \n networking & information \nexchange \n co-ordination of staff \n operational planning \n accounting\/billing \n payroll \n supplies management \n \n\u2022 Communication and function with branches \n \nco-ordination of operations \n availability\/prices\/information \n orders from \nheadquarters\/administration \n share of common resource \ndatabases \n for customer and operational \ninformation \n \nInter-organisational communications & \nfunctions \n\u2022 Tourist product suppliers and \nintermediaries \n \n\u2022 Pre-travel arrangements \n \ngeneral information \n availability\/prices inquiries \n negotiations and bargaining \n reservations & confirmations \n ancillary services \n \n\u2022 Travel related documentation \n \nlists of groups\/visitors \n receipts\/documents \n vouchers & tickets production\n\u2022 Post travel arrangements \n \npayments & commissions \n feedback & suggestions \n complaint handling \nConsumer communication with tourism \nindustry \n \n\u2022 Electronic commerce \n \u2022 Travel advice \n \u2022 Request \navailability\/prices\/information \n \u2022 Reservation & confirmation  \n \u2022 Amendments for a reservation \n \u2022 Deposits and full settlements \n \u2022 Specific requests\/enquiries \nTourism enterprise communication with  \nnon-tourism enterprises \n \n\u2022 Other suppliers and ancillary \nservices \n vaccinations  \n travel formalities & visa \n \u2022 Insurance companies \n \u2022 Weather forecasting \n \u2022 Entertainment and communications \n \u2022 Banking\/financial services \n17 \n \u2022 Feedback\/complaints \n \n\u2022 Credit cards \n \u2022 Other business services \n \nSource: Adapted from (64) Buhalis, 1996, p.133 \n\u0002 Inter-organisational functions \nNetworking supports the communication and facilitates interconnectivity between individual \norganisations. Hence a number of systems and applications emerge to assist communications \nbetween tourism enterprises. Electronic Data Interchange enables the transfer of structured data \nfrom computer to computer (often hosted by different and remote organisations) using agreed \ncommunication standards. This has been extensively utilised between tour operators and handling \nagencies at destinations to transfer passenger lists, invoices and other paper work. Computer \nReservations Systems and Global Distribution Systems are also applications which empower \ncommunication between travel agencies and principals such as airlines, hotels and car rental firms. \nIn addition, Destination Management Systems and Destination Integrated Computer Information \nReservation Management Systems attempt to integrate the management and marketing of \nindependent tourism enterprises at the destination area and thus facilitate interconnectivity21. In \nparticular, small and medium sized tourism enterprises will benefit from ITs-supported networking as \nthey will be able to pool their resources and compete with their larger counterparts.20,43 Electronic \nMail, the World Wide Web, the File Transfer Protocol are some of the most popular uses of the \nInternet which empower interconnectivity and communication between organisations and individuals. \nMoreover, Extranets emerge to provide a secured interface for networked enterprises. Using Internet \ntechnology Extranets facilitate a restricted access and interconnectivity to authorised organisations \nonly, and thus, they facilitate the networking of tourism enterprises. \n \n\u0002 Consumers \nThe development of electronic commerce, defined as \u201cthe secure trading of goods, information and \nservices using Internet technologies\u201d,65  enables consumers to communicate directly with tourism \norganisations in order to request information and purchase products, as well as to interact with \nprincipals. Consumers empowered by home computing can access information about tourism \nproducts and organisations instantly, inexpensively, interactively, almost regardless of the physical \nlocation of both service providers and themselves. They can also make and alter reservations and \npurchase tourism products through electronic shopping and banking systems. The proliferation of \nCD-ROMs also allows the storage and distribution of memory-consuming multimedia presentations \nto both individual and institutional customers, improving the promotional function of organisations. \nServing consumers electronically also contributes to the cost reduction of enterprises. Sun65  \nestimates that face-to-face banking costs $1 per transaction; call centres cost $0.5, whilst Internet \nbanking cost merely $0.15 per transaction. Similarly tourism organisations can reduce their cost and \nimprove their competitiveness by serving consumers through the Internet. \n \nTourism organisations can enhance their performance by empowering their strategic marketing and \nmanagement efforts through undertaking all their functions by advanced ITs. This will enable them to \nimprove their networking and ultimately to improve their \u201cvirtuality\u201d.66  The following examples \ndemonstrate the benefits generated by advanced integration of all management and marketing \nefforts for organisations. \n\u0001 Inter-organisational - Intra-organisational functions \nA number of useful applications are available in the tourism industry, supporting both inter- and intra-\norganisational functions. These often empower joint marketing efforts as well as horizontal, vertical \nor diagonal integration. Tourism enterprises can exchange customer information either to facilitate \nthe formulation of total tourism product or to undertake joint marketing campaigns. For example \nairlines co-operate with hotel chains and car rental companies in issuing frequent flyer miles or \nproviding rewards and privileges to consumers. Airlines also formulate alliances (e.g. Star Alliance) in \norder to enhance their globalisation and to take advantage of code-sharing agreements. This \nenables the provision of seamless products and the development of comprehensive marketing \n18 \ncampaigns. \n \n\u0001 Intra-organisational - Consumers functions \nEnterprises utilise ITs for addressing individual needs and wants of their consumers. Partnership or \nrelationship marketing attempt to maximise customer loyalty by building bonds between consumer \nand organisations. Mutual benefits can be achieved in this way, as consumers gain extra benefits, \nspecial treatment or discounts while enterprises increase the satisfaction and loyalty of their regular \nconsumers. They also gain a wealth of marketing information about their needs and spending habits, \nwithout commissioning expensive marketing research. Direct and database marketing, frequent flyer \nprogrammes and guest histories are often utilised in this sense. Experienced consumers may also \nhave access to some electronic facilities, which enable them to achieve a higher flexibility and \ninteractivity with the organisation. Eventually the development of \u201cone-to-one\u201d marketing, where \ntourism bundles will be packaged for the individual needs of consumers can only be facilitated by ITs. \n \n\u0001 Inter-organisational - Consumers function \nConsumers increasingly utilise inter-organisational functions in order to identify and purchase \nsuitable products and services for their needs. As the vast majority of tourism products is offered by \nsmall and medium-sized tourism enterprises, consumers often need to have access to information, \nprogrammes, schedules, tariffs and availability of a wide range of tourism providers in order to be \nable to amalgamate their tourism products. Thus, Computer Reservations Systems, Destination \nManagement Systems and the World Wide Web are utilised to access data from different \nenterprises, either by individual consumers themselves or by travel agencies acting as brokers on \ntheir behalf. The trend towards independently arranged trips effectively demonstrates that more \nconsumers will rely on technology for selecting, amalgamating and purchasing their tourism \nproducts. \n \nThe multi-dimensional strategic framework for ITs in tourism not only does demonstrate the \ndependence of both demand and supply on ITs, but it also illustrates that networking and interactivity \nwill increasingly dominate the production and consumption functions. Players who fail to participate in \nthe electronic marketplace therefore, will face severe competitive disadvantages in the long term and \nwill probably lose considerable market share. \n \nSYNTHESIS - THE CONTRIBUTION OF ITs TO THE FUTURE TOURISM INDUSTRY \nInformation technologies influence the strategic management and marketing of contemporary \norganisations, as a paradigm-shift is experienced, transforming the \"best\" business practices \nglobally. ITs transform the strategic position of organisations by altering their efficiency, \ndifferentiation, operational cost and response time. In particular, ITs have stimulated radical changes \nin the operation and distribution of the tourism industry. Perhaps the most apparent example in \ntourism is the re-engineering of the booking process, which gradually becomes rationalised and \nenables both consumers and the industry to save considerable time in identifying, amalgamating, \nreserving and purchasing tourism products. Ultimately, prospective tourists will be able to browse \nthrough the Internet and identify a rich variety of offers in order to make travel choices suited to their \npersonal requirements. The focus is thus shifting towards individual travel and dynamic packages, \ntargeting mini-segments. The visibility of principals in the marketplace will be a function of the \ntechnologies and networks utilised to interact with individual and institutional customers. A closer co-\noperation is also required throughout the tourism industry, as well as a certain degree of \nstandardisation and interconnectivity. This will improve service and provide a seamless travel \nexperience, whilst it will enable tourism organisations to manage their competitiveness within the new \nenvironment imposed by contemporary developments, such as deregulation and globalisation. ITs \nprovide an unprecedented opportunity for horizontal, vertical and diagonal integration, as well as for \nthe development of virtual enterprises.66 Training and education of human resources in both \ninnovation management and ITs will enable the industry to develop an understanding of the \ncontemporary developments and a vision for the future.  \n19 \n \nHowever, ITs are not a panacea and therefore, a thorough revision of all operational and strategic \nmanagerial practices is required in order to achieve the emerging benefits. Should tourism principals \nneglect the significance of ITs, they will effectively jeopardise their competitiveness and become \nmarginalised from the mainstream of the tourism industry. Business processes re-engineering \nredesigns the inter- and intra-organisational processes, based on the newly available tools and aims \nto improve the entire range of functions. In return, re-engineering gives perspective and empowers \norganisations to achieve competitive advantages and overcome long-term threats. As a result, \ntourism enterprises need to understand, incorporate and utilise ITs strategically, in order to be able to \nserve their target markets, improve their efficiency, maximise profitability, enhance services and \nmaintain long term prosperity for both themselves and destinations. The future success of tourism \norganisations and destinations will be determined by a combination of innovative management and \nmarketing, intellect and vision, as well as strategic use of advanced ITs. \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n1Poon, A., Tourism, technology and competitive strategies, CAB International, Oxford, 1993. \n \n2Hopper, L., Rattling SABRE-New ways to compete on information, Harvard
