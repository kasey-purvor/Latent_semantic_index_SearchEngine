INTRODUCTION\nApproaches to the design and development\nof fault-tolerant aircraft navigation systems have\nbeen studied for over three decades. During this\nperiod, many fault-tolerant aircraft navigation system\narchitectures, data fusion filter architectures, and\nfiltering algorithms have been proposed, including\ncentralized, cascaded, federated, and distributed\n(decentralized) filter architectures and algorithms [1].\nA wide range of publications cover the integration\nof inertial navigation system (INS) and the Global\nPositioning Systems (GPS) using Kalman filtering\ntechniques [2, 3]. The design of an integrated\nnavigation filter is either based on the navigation\nstate solutions given by GPS (referred to as state\nfusion) or relies on raw GPS measurements (including\npseudo-range), Doppler, and\/or GPS carrier phase\n(known as measurement fusion). The estimates given\nby the filter can be used to periodically update the\nINS-based navigation states (open-loop mechanism)\nor to constrain inertial sensor errors and correct the\nnavigation state errors (closed-loop mechanism).\nRecent research has focused on the use of inertial\ninformation to aid the GPS receiver carrier and code\ntracking loops, effectively reducing the bandwidth of\nthese loops to improve the antijamming capability and\ndynamic performance of a GPS receiver [4]. These\nclosed-loop systems provide significant improvements\nin estimation of the navigation state in comparison\nwith open-loop systems.\nDevelopments of GPS carrier phase interferometric\nmeasurements to determine aircraft attitude have\nshown that a multi-antenna GPS receiver with\ninnovative GPS attitude determination algorithms\ncan provide measurements of aircraft attitude with\nacceptable accuracy, subject to GPS signal quality\n[5\u20147], and many reliable integer ambiguity resolution\ntechniques have been presented for GPS-based attitude\ndetermination [8\u201410]. Integration of an INS with a\nGPS receiver incorporating attitude determination can\nimprove both the long-term attitude stability and the\nshort-term attitude accuracy. In these applications,\nthe navigation filter is typically provided by a state\nfusion Kalman filter, where the differences between\nthe navigation state solutions from an INS and a GPS\nattitude receiver provide the observables of the filter\n[11].\nIntegration of a low-cost attitude heading reference\nsystem (AHRS) with a GPS attitude receiver is\nreported by Gebre-Egziabher [12], where an attitude\nfusion filter with a constant gain blends the attitude\nsolution from inertial sensors and the attitude solution\nfrom a GPS attitude receiver; the angular rates are\nused to propagate the attitude solutions in time.\nOther methods use the attitude information from\ninertial systems and other sensors to aid GPS attitude\ndetermination, by reducing the search space to resolve\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS VOL. 43, NO. 1 JANUARY 2007 371\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

However, few studies\nhave compared the performance of SRIMU\/MF-GPS\nintegrated navigation systems incorporating different\nqualities of inertial sensors or considered the effects\nof GPS measurements in the design of a multi-mode\nnavigation filter. In addition, when simple angular\nrate models and constant filter gains are used to\npropagate the attitude solution (rather than a more\ncomplex inertial error model), high-quality gyros and\na faster update rate of the GPS attitude solutions are\nnecessary in order to reduce the attitude propagation\nerror. Although a 10 Hz attitude output rate has been\nreported [6], development of a reliable GPS-based\nattitude determination algorithm is challenging,\nparticularly for cycle slip detection and integer\nambiguity resolution in flexible wing structures.\nMost current integrated systems are limited to\northogonally-configured inertial measurement units\n(IMUs) where the inertial measurement sensed by\none sensor mounted in one axis is independent of\nmeasurements of sensors mounted in the other axes.\nThis configuration offers several advantages in terms\nof IMU error calibration models and manufacturing.\nSeveral IMU error calibration models have been\napplied to the design of integrated navigation filters to\ncorrect orthogonal IMU errors. However, an aircraft\nnavigation system usually needs more than three\nIMUs to provide the necessary fault tolerance of the\nnavigation functions, with concomitant increases in\nweight and power consumption.\nWith recent advances in sensor technologies,\nlow-cost small-size tactical-grade inertial sensors have\nbeen developed, which can be integrated in a single\nsuite using nonorthogonal configurations, where the\nsensing axes of the inertial sensors are skewed with\nrespect to the orthogonal axes of the inertial suite.\nSuch IMUs are usually known as skewed-redundant\nIMUs (SRIMUs). In comparison with traditional\nfault-tolerant IMU designs [1], one SRIMU suite can\nreplace multiple IMUs to reduce the cost, size, and\nmass of the inertial navigation equation, and provide\nredundant inertial measurements (angular rates and\naccelerations) using fewer inertial sensors to increase\nthe reliability and fault tolerance of an integrated\nnavigation system. SRIMU designs can exploit the\nbenefits of emerging inertial sensor technologies\nand high-speed embedded microprocessor systems\nand will provide the basis for the future generations\nof fault-tolerant navigation systems. Integration\nof a low-cost SRIMU with a multifunctional GPS\nreceiver (SRIMU\/MF-GPS) offers the potential to\nreduce the cost, size, and power consumption of\naircraft navigation systems, while meeting the required\nnavigation performance (RNP) of aircraft navigation\nsystems in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity,\nand availability. However, no significant research has\nbeen undertaken to evaluate the accuracy required by\ninertial sensors integrated with an MF-GPS receiver or\nthe effects of update rate of GPS attitude information.\nOne major problem with SRIMUs is that\nconventional IMU error calibration models cannot\nbe used in the design of an SRIMU\/MF-GPS\nintegrated navigation filter because the required\ninertial quantities are a linear combination of all\nSRIMU measurements and the definition of sensor\nmisalignments in SRIMU configurations is different\nfrom that in an orthogonal IMU configuration. In\nprevious SRIMU studies, emphasis has been given to\ndetection and isolation of inertial sensor failures [15,\n16]. For example, Hall [16] describes a parity vector\ncompensation method for sensor failure detection and\nisolation (FDI) where the combined sensor errors are\nmodeled as a first-order Markov process and then\nestimated by means of a 12-state Kalman filter using\nthe parity residuals as the filter observables. This\ncompensation technique enhances the effect of true\nfailure signals on the parity residual vector and can\nimprove the performance of generalized likelihood\nratio test (GLRT) algorithms. However, this error\ncompensation filter cannot correct each physical\nsensor in an SRIMU configuration owing to the\nlack of a proper SRIMU error model. Allerton [17]\nproposes an SRIMU error calibration model which\nredefines the inertial sensor misalignments and can be\nused to compensate for SRIMU measurement errors.\nIn addition, the redundant information provided by\nan SRIMU system can be used for both the detection\nof sensor failures and also for the correction of the\nSRIMU measurements in the design of a multi-mode\nnavigation filter by increasing the observability of\ninertial sensor errors.\nThis paper describes the design of a multi-mode\nnavigation filter used in the development of\nSRIMU\/MF-GPS integrated navigation systems.\nThe feasibility and performance of this integration\ndesign is assessed and evaluated by simulation\nmethods. The accuracy of the inertial gyros used in\nthe evaluation ranges from 1\u00b1\/h to 30\u00b1\/h, covering\ncurrent low-cost inertial sensor technologies used\nin applications including regional aircraft, general\naviation, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The paper is\norganized as follows: Section II introduces the system\narchitecture. The design of a multi-mode navigation\nfilter is described in Section III. Section IV discusses\nSRIMU\/MF-GPS error dynamic models and the\nsimulation results are presented in Section V.\nII. FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE\nThe research originated from the Smart Hybrid\nIntegrated Navigation Equipment (SHINE) project,\nsupported by the EU Framework V programme. In the\nSHINE system, an SRIMU and a dual-antenna GPS\nreceiver were integrated into a single unit to provide\nreliable position, velocity, attitude information,\nand kinematic parameters required by avionics\n372 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS VOL. 43, NO. 1 JANUARY 2007\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

The\nSRIMU consists of multiple accelerometers and\ngyros providing redundant inertial measurements. A\ndual-antenna GPS receiver is used with an antenna\nbaseline of approximately 2 m to estimate the\naircraft pitch and heading. The research reported\nhere extends this approach to SRIMU\/MF-GPS\nintegration. The dual-antenna GPS receiver is replaced\nby a multifunctional GPS receiver, which provides\nthe GPS-based navigation states and raw GPS\nmeasurements.\nAlthough many innovative GPS-based attitude\ndetermination algorithms have been proposed,\nthis paper focuses on the design of multi-mode\nnavigation filter algorithms rather than GPS-based\nattitude-determination algorithms. The functional\narchitecture of the overall integrated system is shown\nin Fig. 1 where z(tk) is the normalized measurement\nvector, \u00a9(x,\u00a2t) is the adjustable system transition\nmatrix, and Q(tk) and R(tk) are the covariances of\nthe system and measurement noise, respectively. All\nmatrices are generated by the preprocessing module.\nAir data sensors (ADS), which provide air speed\nand barometric altitude, and a magnetic heading\nsensor are integrated with the SRIMU\/MF-GPS\nsystem to improve the observability of the multi-mode\nnavigation filter.\nIn this architecture, the SRIMU FDI detects inertial\nsensor failures whereas RAIM (receiver autonomous\nintegrity monitoring) is used for auxiliary GPS FDI\n[18\u201420]. The SRIMU FDI algorithm extends the\nbasic GLRT algorithm [15, 16] by adding an SRIMU\ncompensation filter and a sequential GLRT algorithm\nto improve the performance of the GLRT algorithm,\nparticularly the capability to detect mid-value and\ndrift failures. Both the SRIMU FDI and RAIM use\nredundant measurements to detect sensor signal\nfailures. With the exception of the initialization of data\nfor the multi-mode navigation filter, the preprocessor\nperforms the GPS-based attitude, positioning and\ninertial navigation computations derived from GPS\nmeasurements to provide backup functions for\nthe multi-mode navigation filter. The multi-mode\nnavigation filter estimates the navigation state and\nsensor errors and also compensates for the sensor\nmeasurement errors. The integrity of the navigation\nsolutions given by the navigation filter is monitored at\nthe system level by the navigation solution integrity\nmonitoring (NSIM) function, which is based on\ncovariance analysis and a statistical test of the filter\nresiduals [21\u201423]. This paper focuses on the design\nof a multi-mode navigation filter; the design of the\nSRIMU compensation filter and sequential FDI\nalgorithms is outside the scope of the paper [26].\nIII. MULTI-MODE NAVIGATION FILTER\nA. Kalman Filter Algorithm\nThe multi-mode navigation filter developed here\nis based on the Kalman filtering techniques. Consider\nthe discrete-time stochastic process, where the system\nand measurement models are given by\nx(tk) =\u00a9(tk, tk\u00a11)x(tk\u00a11)+G(tk\u00a11)v(tk\u00a11) (1)\nz(tk) =H(tk)x(tk)+w(tk) (2)\nwhere x is an n-system state, \u00a9 is an n\u00a3 n state\ntransition matrix, H is an m\u00a3 n measurement matrix,\nG is an n\u00a3q matrix, z is an m-measurement vector,\nv is an q-additive process noise which takes account\nof the system perturbations, and w is an m-additive\nmeasurement noise. It is assumed that v and w are\nindependent, zero-mean, white Gaussian sequences\nwith covariances Q and R, respectively. The initial\nsystem state x(t0) is a Gaussian distributed random\nvariable with an initial value x0 and covariance P0 and\nis independent of the noise.\nThe Kalman filter algorithm implementation is as\nfollows [24].\nStep 1 Initialization\nP(t0) = P0, x\u02c6(t0) = x0: (3)\nStep 2 Time update (predictor, effect of\ndynamics)\nx\u02c6(t\u00a1k ) =\u00a9(tk, tk\u00a11)x\u02c6(t\n+\nk\u00a11) (4)\nP(t\u00a1k ) =\u00a9(tk, tk\u00a11)P(t\n+\nk\u00a11)\u00a9\nT(tk, tk\u00a11)\n+G(tk\u00a11)Q(tk\u00a11)G\nT(tk\u00a11) (5)\nr(tk) = z(tk)\u00a1H(tk)x\u02c6(t\u00a1k ) (6)\nS(tk) =H(tk)P(t\n\u00a1\nk )H\nT(tk) +R(tk): (7)\nStep 3 Measurement update (estimator, effect of\nmeasurement)\nK(tk) = P(t\n\u00a1\nk )H\nT(tk)S\n\u00a11(tk) (8)\nx\u02c6(t+k ) = x\u02c6(t\n\u00a1\nk ) +K(tk)r(tk) (9)\nP(t+k ) = P(t\n\u00a1\nk )\u00a1K(tk)H(tk)P(t\u00a1k ): (10)\nALLERTON & JIA: REDUNDANT MULTI-MODE FILTER FOR A NAVIGATION SYSTEM 373\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

This feature\nis usually exploited in the analysis of Kalman filter\nintegrity for failure detection and also for checking the\nconsistency of measurement data and monitoring the\nfilter divergence.\nB. Multi-Mode Navigation Filter Architecture\nThe proposed multi-mode navigation filter\narchitecture is shown in Fig. 2 and the operating\nmodes of the navigation filter are summarized in\nTable I, where the modes are selected on the basis of\navailable measurement information. The SRIMU\/FDI\nmodule generates estimates of the specific force\ntriad, the angular rate triad and the sensor health\nstatus report, which are used to reconfigure the\ninertial system and the multi-mode navigation filter.\nIt also outputs the SRIMU measurement residuals,\nwhich are used as the observables of the multi-mode\nnavigation filter. The ADS and heading sensor\nmodule provide pressure altitude compensation\nneeded for the stabilization of the vertical channel\nof the inertial system, as well as heading and air\nspeed measurements for the multi-mode navigation\nfilter. The inertial navigation module combines\nthe SRIMU\/FDI module outputs, pressure altitude,\nand the positions of visible GPS satellites from the\nMF-GPS module to provide coarse estimates of the\nnavigation states and the computed range and range\nrate of the visible GPS satellites. One additional\nfunction of this module is to provide backup for the\nmulti-mode navigation filter when GPS signals are\nunavailable. The architecture of the inertial module,\nincluding other functions implemented in the module,\nis illustrated in Fig. 3. The MF-GPS\/RAIM module\noutputs GPS-derived navigation states and corrected\npseudo-range and range rates.

DYNAMIC MODELS OF MULTI-MODE\nNAVIGATION FILTER\nA. Inertial System Error Dynamic Model\nIn this paper, the navigation frame is based on\nthe wander-azimuth frame and the error dynamic\nmodels of the inertial system are developed using\na perturbation model with respect to the true\nwander-azimuth frame. The normalized error dynamic\nmodels [26] are derived as follows.\n1) Velocity Error Differential Equation: The\nvelocity error states are selected in order to simplify\nthe formulation of the error models [25] and are\ndefined in the wander-azimuth frame as follows.\n\u00b1 _v1 =\u00a1[(!we\/w\u00a3)+2(!wI\/e\u00a3)]\u00b1v1 + fw\u00a3 @\u00c1+ \u00b1gw\n\u00a1 (fw + gw)\u00a3 @\u03bc+rw (15)\nwhere \u00b1v1 is the alternative velocity error vector and\nis defined by v\u02dcw = [I\u00a1 (@\u03bc\u00a3)]vw + \u00b1v1, v\u02dcw and vw\nare the estimated and true velocity vectors, fw is the\nspecific force vector, gw is the gravity vector, !we\/w\nis the transport rate vector and !wI\/e is the Earth rate\nvector, @\u03bc is the angular position error vector, @\u00c1\nis the phi-angle error vector given in (16), \u00b1gw is\nthe variation of the gravity vector, and rw is the\ntotal accelerometer error vector.

These equations and (21) can be configured for\nspecific sensors. The reconfiguration is based on the\noperating modes given in Table I.\nV. SIMULATION STUDY AND RESULTS\nTo evaluate the multi-mode navigation filter,\na multisensor simulation model was developed,\nincluding an MF-GPS simulator and an SRIMU\nsimulator. The MF-GPS simulator provides GPS-based\nattitude information and raw GPS measurements\nincluding pseudo-range and pseudo-range rate at\nthe rate of 1 Hz. The accuracy of the simulated\nGPS-based attitude estimates is 0:3\u00b1 (\u00be) if the GPS\nattitude solution is available. The SRIMU simulator\ncan simulate several SRIMU configurations, including\ncube and cone configurations (for different cone-spin\naxis directions) and dodecahedron configurations.\nThe SRIMU simulator, together with a true trajectory\ngenerator, generates realistic SRIMU measurements\nat the rate of 50 Hz. The true trajectory is used as\na reference to compute the error of the estimated\naircraft motion states. The simulated gyro sensors\nhave gyro drift rates from 1\u00b1\/h to 30\u00b1\/h. All simulated\naccelerometers have a typical bias error of 300 \u00b9g.\nThe SRIMU simulator also simulates other error\nsources, including time-dependent sensor drifts,\nmisalignments, scale factor errors and sensor noise.\nThe simulation parameters of the inertial sensors used\nin the simulation are summarized in Table II. The\nsimulated aircraft can perform arbitrary maneuvers\nFig. 4. Aircraft horizontal maneuvers.\nto a maximum acceleration of 3.0 g; Fig. 4 illustrates\ntypical horizontal velocity maneuvers. The simulation\nresults given here were based on a 5-sensor cone\nconfiguration with four grades of gyro sensors with\ngyro drift rates of 1\u00b1\/h, 10\u00b1\/h, 20\u00b1\/h, and 30\u00b1\/h. In\ncomparison with other 5-sensor configurations [26],\nthe 5-sensor cone configuration is of interest because\nit exhibits the minimal performance degradation for\none sensor failure, which is an important consideration\nin fault-tolerant design. In the following plotted\nresults, the navigation state errors are the differences\nbetween the true and estimated values and the\nstandard deviations are computed from the covariances\nof the navigation state errors estimated by the\nmulti-mode filter.\nFig. 5 shows the navigation state errors given by\nthe multi-mode navigation filter for SRIMU gyros\nwith a drift rate of 1\u00b1\/h. After the initial 10 min\ncorrection and alignment, the GPS attitude information\nwas interrupted for 5 min every 5 min during a 2 h\nflight. The absolute attitude errors (the difference\nbetween the true and estimated values) remained\nwithin 0:15\u00b1. The lateral velocity errors were less\nthan 0.5 m\/s with a probability of 98%. Fig. 5 also\nindicates that the attitude estimates quickly converge\nto their stable state. Fig. 6 illustrates the convergence\nrates of the standard deviations of the navigation state\nerrors estimated by the multi-mode filter. It can be\nseen that the standard deviations of the attitude errors\ngradually increase when GPS attitude information\nis no available and converge to 0:2\u00b1 after the initial\n10 min period. Because an initial yaw error of 1:5\u00b1\nwas assumed, the convergence rate of the standard\ndeviation of the yaw error is slower than the other\nattitude errors during the initial 10 min period of\nalignment. The standard deviations of the lateral\nvelocity errors converged to 0:2\u00b1 m\/s. The vertical\nvelocity exhibits a larger error compared with the\nlateral velocity error as a result of the vertical dilution\nof precision of GPS.\nALLERTON & JIA: REDUNDANT MULTI-MODE FILTER FOR A NAVIGATION SYSTEM 379\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

The integrated navigation\nperformance of the integrated navigation system\nis significantly improved when MF-GPS attitude\ninformation is available for a longer period, typically\nin excess of 5 min.\nBecause the positioning accuracy of the\nmulti-mode integrated navigation system is strongly\ninfluenced by the GPS positioning accuracy and\nthe simulation results show that the accuracy of the\nposition state estimation is not affected by the gyro\ndrift error, the position error and standard deviation\nare omitted in the following simulation results.\nIn Figs. 9 and 10 the SRIMU gyro drift rate is\nincreased from 1\u00b1\/h to 10\u00b1\/h. After an initial 10 min\nalignment, the GPS attitude solution was again\ninterrupted for 5 min every 5 min. Although the\nconvergence rate of the multi-mode navigation filter is\nslower, the integrated navigation system still exhibits\nsatisfactory navigation performance if the period of\ninterruption of the GPS attitude solution does not\nexceed 5 min. If the initial alignment and correction\ntime is increased from 10 min to 15 min, the accuracy\nof the attitude estimates improves significantly. From\nFig. 10, it can be seen that the convergence rate of\nthe standard deviations of the attitude errors was\nmuch slower than the previous simulation results.\nNevertheless, similar accuracy was achieved for the\nattitude and lateral velocity errors.\nIf the SRIMU gyro drift rate is increased to 20\u00b1\/h\nand 30\u00b1\/h, the simulation studies show that the initial\nalignment time must also be increased to achieve\nsufficient attitude accuracy. The MF-GPS receiver is\nrequired to continuously provide the attitude solution\nfor 5 min after an attitude interruption has taken\nplace.

In order to develop lower cost\ninertial\/MF-GPS integrated navigation systems, the\nMF-GPS receiver must be able to provide high rate\nand accurate Doppler estimates in order to increase\nthe multi-mode filter update rate and to improve the\naccuracy of the velocity estimate. Current research on\ninertial-aiding GPS integration mechanisms offers a\npotential solution to this problem.\nFurther simulation studies were performed\nusing GPS-based position and velocity information.\nComparing the simulation results with values reported\nby Wolf [11], although the use of GPS-based position\nand velocity information can provide better estimates\nof the navigation states, the fusion has a significant\ndisadvantage. If the number of visible satellites is\nless than four, then GPS-based position and velocity\ninformation will be unavailable and GPS attitude\ninformation alone cannot reduce the degradation of\nthe navigation velocity state.\nBy observing all the error standard deviations\nplotted, it should be noted that the error covariances\nof the estimated states were slightly divergent when\nthe multi-mode filter switched from GPS attitude\nmodes to non-GPS attitude modes, especially where\nlower cost inertial sensors were modeled. However,\nthe simulation results also show that this divergence\ncan be controlled if the GPS attitude interruption does\nnot exceed 5 min after the necessary initial alignment\nand calibration. The authors suggest that further\nwork should be done in the stability analysis of the\nmulti-mode filter.\nIn the simulation studies, the changes of the\nSRIMU configurations, which lead to reconfiguration\nof the parity residual equation, had no significant\ninfluence on the filter stability.\nALLERTON & JIA: REDUNDANT MULTI-MODE FILTER FOR A NAVIGATION SYSTEM 385\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis simulation study has demonstrated the\nfeasibility of integrating low-cost SRIMU systems\nwith a multifunctional GPS receiver to achieve\nthe required navigation performance using the\nmulti-mode Kalman filter described in this paper. A\nwide range of low-cost inertial sensors were evaluated,\ncovering the performance of the majority of currently\navailable inertial sensors. For SRIMU gyro drift rates\nranging from 1\u00b1\/h to 10\u00b1\/h, the aiding GPS attitude\ninformation can be interrupted for up to 12 min (after\nan initial 10 min alignment). After a GPS attitude\ninterruption occurs, the in-flight correction time is\napproximately 3 min. In other words, the minimum\nrequirement for the continuous availability of GPS\nattitude information is 3 min. If the gyro drift rate\nvalue is increased from 20\u00b1\/h to 30\u00b1\/h, the initial\ncorrection alignment time must be increased to\n15 min (maximum) to achieve the required attitude\naccuracy. The minimum requirement for continuous\navailability of GPS attitude information is 5 min in\norder to correct SRIMU errors in flight. For larger\nvalues of gyro drift rate, the accuracy of the velocity\nestimate depends on the accuracy of GPS Doppler\nmeasurements. Compared with other methods,\ndynamic inertial error models were developed rather\nthan simple state propagation models, which enabled\nsensor errors to be estimated by the multi-mode\nKalman filter for low-cost SRIMUs. This simulation\nstudy shows that MF-GPS\/SRIMU integrated systems\ncan be used for general aviation aircraft and civil\ntransport aircraft to provide control and navigation\nsensor systems.\nAPPENDIX\n\u00b1gw \u00bc\n2664\n0\n0\n\u00a1 2g0\u00b1h\nRa +h\n3775 (33)\n386 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS VOL. 43, NO. 1 JANUARY 2007\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.
