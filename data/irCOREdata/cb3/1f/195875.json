Following cerebral ischaemia, a significant benefit of progesterone was observed regardless of the assigned study quality score (P=0.0002) whereas, following traumatic brain injury (TBI) a significant benefit of progesterone was only observed in studies that obtained the highest quality score of 5 (P= 0.02). Progesterone reduced lesion volume in a dose-dependent manner following either cerebral ischaemia (P< 0.001) or TBI (P=0.03) with the most effective progesterone dose varying according to experimental injury model used. Progesterone treatment was only effective at reducing lesion volume when administered immediately following (i.e. 0-2 h) cerebral ischaemia (P=0.0008).
