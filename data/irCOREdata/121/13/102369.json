INTRODUCTION\nORTHOGONAL frequency-division multiplexing(OFDM) modulator usually employs cyclic prefix\n(CP) or zero padding (ZP) to mitigate the interblock interfer-\nence (IBI) [1]. These are called CP-OFDM and ZP-OFDM\nsystems, respectively (see [2]). Recent literatures (e.g., [3])\nsuggested to replace the zero sequence in ZP-OFDM with a\nnumber of known symbols and named the proposed system\npseudo random postfix (PRP) OFDM. The major advantage of\nusing PRP technique is enabling the low-complexity first-order\nstatistics (FOS)-based estimation of (quasi-) static channels.\nIn the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OFDM system,\nemploying distinct PRPs at transmit antennas makes the MIMO\nchannel estimation much easier [4].\nIn the slowly time-varying (TV) channel, statistics-based al-\ngorithms can only obtain the averaged channel state informa-\ntion (ACSI). The mismatch between ACSI and instant CSI will\nincrease the equalization error. This motivates us to investigate\nthe ACSI-tracking capability of both FOS-based and SOS-based\nchannel estimation algorithms. To carry out the reasonable com-\nparison, we extended the subspace-based channel estimation al-\ngorithm from ZP-OFDM to PRP-OFDM and developed a PRP-\nbased SOS algorithm as well.

It is shown that the ACSI ob-\ntained by the FOS-based approach is a good estimation of the\ninstant CSIs at the middle of the data record, and the ACSI\nestimated by the SOS-based approach is a good estimation of\ninstant CSIs at the head of the data record. We observe that\nthe FOS-based approach has stronger capability of tracking the\nslowly TV channel. Then, the estimated ACSI is used for the\nchannel equalization. Simulation results show that the SOS-\nbased approaches converge to the FOS-based approach in the\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.\nII. PRP-OFDM IN THE TV CHANNEL\nTo simplify the presentation and clarify our idea, this letter\nonly considers the single-antenna-based PRP-OFDM system,\nwhich is described in [3]. Prior to transmission, the informa-\ntion-bearing blocks with the size are fed into\nZP-OFDM modulator to generate the ZP-OFDM blocks. The\ninput\u2013output relationship is given by\n(1)\nwhere is the discrete Fourier trans-\nform (DFT) matrix with the th entry\n, is the length\nof the zero sequence, and is the Hermitian transpose.\nThen, we let and superimpose a training block\nonto to produce the PRP-OFDM\nsignal for transmission, i.e.,\n(2)\nwhere is the matrix transpose, and is the\ntraining block.1 The PRP-OFDM signal goes\nthrough the slowly TV channel with the impulse response\n, where\ndenotes the upper bound of channel order. Due to the slowly TV\nchannel assumption, does not vary considerably within a\nfew OFDM blocks [6]. Then, the noiseless version of received\nblocks are expressible as (see [1] for detail)\n(3)\n1The reviewer (also in [3]) suggests to use a randomized version of p as\n\u000b(n)p to guarantee the spectral flatness, where \u000b(n) is pseudo random with\nj\u000b(n)j = 1 and Ef\u000b(n)g = 0. Because \u000b(n) is known at the receiver and\ndoes not affect the channel estimation (see [3]), we ignore this factor in this\nletter for convenience.\n1070-9908\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

We plug (2) into (3) and can\neasily obtain (see [2] for detail)\n(4)\nwhere is a circulant channel ma-\ntrix. The linear models (2) and (4) show that the PRP-OFDM\nis a kind of superimposed-training scheme for the ZP-OFDM\nsystem. If the channel is static, then the FOS-based channel es-\ntimator can offer very good estimation performance (see [3], [8],\nand [9]).\nOnce the channel knowledge is available, the PRP\nterm can be easily eliminated from (4). Then, the residual term\nbecomes the noiseless version of the received ZP-OFDM signal.\nEqualization of ZP-OFDM has been well addressed in [2]. Later\non, we discuss the channel estimation issue based on the noisy\nversion of the received signal, i.e.,\n(5)\nwhere is the zero-mean white Gaussian noise and is un-\ncorrelated with .\nIII. CHANNEL ESTIMATION IN THE SLOWLY TV SCENARIO\nThe slowly TV channel is usually modeled by the first-order\nMarkov channel (see [4], [7], and [11]), i.e.,\n(6)\nwhere is the 0th-order Bessel function of the first kind,\nis the maximum Doppler shift normalized by the OFDM symbol\nduration, and is zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance\n. Using the approximation , [4] rep-\nresents (6) into the following moving average process:\n(7)\nwhere .\nA. FOS-Based Approach\nThe FOS-based approach takes the average of to obtain\nthe ACSI. Denoting to be the data record length (DRL), the\naverage of , for , can be expressed by\n(8)\nwhere denotes the start index, and is given by\n(9)\nThen, we perform -point DFT on and obtain (see [2] for\ndetail derivation)\n(10)\nwhere , is formed by the first\ncolumns of the -point DFT matrix , and denotes\na diagonal matrix with the vector in its diagonal. If has\nthe full-column rank, [3] uses to obtain the\nchannel estimate in the static channel, where denotes the\npseudo inverse. In the slowly TV channel, is the estimated\nACSI given by\n(11)\nUsing (7), we are able to rewrite (11) into the following form:\n(12)\nwhere is the average of . Since is practically\nsmall (e.g., 0.1) in the slowly TV scenario, is a\nmonotonically decreasing (increasing) function for\n. Then, we can find an index , which fulfills\n(13)\nPlugging (13) into (12), we have\n(14)\nThis result shows that the estimated ACSI is also the estimate\nof the instant CSI at the block index . Moreover, we\nobserve that approximates a first-order polynomial\nfor ; therefore, should be close to .\nB.

In order to resolve the residual scalar ambiguity, pilot\nsymbols should be placed in the th OFDM block.\nC.

SIMULATION RESULTS\nTo benchmark the channel estimators, we used the nor-\nmalized mean-square-error (NMSE) of the channels defined\nas . Here, is the number of\nMonte Carlo trials. The parameters of PRP-OFDM systems\nwere set as , , and .\nThe information-bearing symbols were drawn from the quadra-\nture phase-shift keying (QPSK) constellation with the equal\nprobability. The subcarrier spacing of 312.5 KHz was the\nsame as HIPERLAN\/2 [13]. The PRP was constructed by the\nKaiser window [14], which was the same as the setting in [3].\nThe PRP-to-information power ratio was given by .\nThe SNR is defined by the average received bit energy to\nnoise [11]. The slowly TV finite impulse response\n(FIR) channels are generated according to the channel model A\nspecified by ETSI for HIPERLAN\/2 [15], where each tap varies\naccording to Jakes\u2019 model with a maximum Doppler frequency\nof 104 Hz corresponding to the terminal speed m\/s and\nan operating frequency of 5.2 GHz.\n1) Evaluation of Channel NMSE: The channel estimation\nwas implemented by collecting PRP-OFDM blocks.\nWe averaged simulation results over Monte Carlo\ntrials. Fig. 1 shows the NMSE for the investigated channel esti-\nmators at SNR dB (typical SNR) and 20 dB, respectively.\nIt can be observed that the FOS-based estimator is not sensitive\nto the SNR. Consistent with the conclusion in Section III-A,\nFig. 1 shows that the FOS-based approach can estimate the in-\nstant CSI accurately at the block index . However, the\nNMSE increases rapidly with the increase of . Note that\nthe subspace-based approach uses six pilot symbols in the first\nOFDM block to resolve the scalar ambiguity. Its channel NMSE\nis related to the estimation accuracy of the residual scalar, which\nis quite sensitive to the SNR. The PRP-based SOS estimator\nonly needs to resolve a phase ambiguity and thus outperforms\nthe subspace-based estimator.\n2) Evaluation of Overall System Performance: We assume\nthat each data burst (a frame) has 600 PRP-OFDM blocks. To\nresolve the residual ambiguity, six pilot symbols are embedded\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 16,2010 at 12:15:55 EST from IEEE Xplore.

The channel tracking method\nis given as follows.\n1) Collect the first blocks in a frame for the\nchannel estimation.\n2) Each new channel estimation is implemented by dis-\ncarding the first 50 old data records and collecting 50\nnew blocks.\nUsing the above channel tracking method, the estimation per-\nformance along the data burst is plotted in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows\nbit-error rate (BER) as a function of SNR. We can see that\nthe FOS-based approach dominates the SOS-based approaches.\nTheir performance is very close in the high-SNR range. We can\nalso observe that the PRP-based SOS approach outperforms the\nsubspace-based approach.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this letter, we have investigated the FOS- and SOS-based\nchannel estimators for PRP-OFDM in the slowly TV channel.\nTheoretical analysis together with simulation results have\nshown that the FOS-based approach has stronger capability of\ntracking the slowly TV channel, particularly in the low and\nmoderate SNR range.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Z.
