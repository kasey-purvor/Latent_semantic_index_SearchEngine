We have developed an efficient method to calculate stochastic regularization operators for given geostatistical models. The method, which combines circulant embedding and the diagonalization theorem of circulant matrices, is applicable for stationary geostatistical models when the grid discretization, in each spatial direction, is uniform in the volume of interest. We also used a structural approach to jointly invert cross-hole electrical resistance and ground-penetrating radar traveltime data in three dimensions. The two models are coupled by assuming, at all points, that the cross product of the gradients of the two models is zero. No petrophysical relationship between electrical conductivity and relative permittivity is assumed but is instead obtained as a by-product of the inversion.

Introduction\n[2] Combinations of cross-hole tomographic techniques\n(e.g., ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistance\ntomography (ERT), and seismics) are increasingly used in\nhydrogeological site characterization [e.g., Hubbard et al.,\n2001; Binley et al., 2002a, 2002b; Tronicke et al., 2004]. In\norder to produce a hydrogeological model, different geo-\nphysical data types are typically inverted individually and,\nat a later stage, combined with other geophysical models\nand available hydrogeological data [e.g., Hubbard et al.,\n2001].\n[3] Geophysical inverse problems are often regularized\nbecause of noise in the data and the mixed determined\ncharacter of most inverse problems [e.g., Menke, 1984]. In\nthis paper, we define regularization operators that are\nconsistent with available borehole data and geological\nunderstanding; thereby, constructing models of physical\nproperties that are more closely related to the underlying\ngeology compared with models obtained from inversion\nschemes that use traditional regularization operators, such\nas damping [Marquardt, 1970] or Tikhonov regularization\n[Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977]. We show that when the grid\ndiscretization is uniform in each spatial direction, stochastic\nregularization operators can be calculated efficiently for a\ngiven stationary geostatistical model by combining circulant\nembedding of the model covariance matrix [e.g., Dietrich\nand Newsam, 1997] and the diagonalization theorem of\ncirculant matrices [e.g., Golub and Van Loan, 1996].\n[4] Another feature of geophysical inverse problems is\nthat the resolution of the resulting models varies throughout\nthe model and that the patterns of resolution variations\nare different for different geophysical techniques [e.g.,\nDay-Lewis et al., 2005]. For example, models based on\ncross-hole ERT where the electrical resistance is measured\nby a transmission of currents implanted at the ground\nsurface or in boreholes [e.g., LaBrecque et al., 1996] have\nthe highest resolution close to the boreholes.

It should therefore\nbe possible to improve the resulting models by jointly\ninverting cross-hole ERT and GPR data.\n[5] Joint inversion of geophysical data has received\nconsiderable attention within the geophysical community.\nGeophysical data that are sensitive to the same physical\nquantity, for example, magnetotelluric and DC resistivity\ndata [Vozoff and Jupp, 1975], can be simultaneously\ninverted by minimizing an objective function that includes\nthe data misfit of the different data types and the most\ndifficult task is how to determine the relative weighting of\nthe different data types [Lines et al., 1988]. When collecting\ndata that are sensitive to different physical quantities, it\nmight be possible to perform joint inversion by mildly\nconstraining the solutions around an assumed petrophysical\nrelationship, for example, a ratio of P and S wave trav-\neltimes [e.g., Tryggvason et al., 2002]. However, petrophys-\nical links between geophysical properties, at a specific site,\nare in many cases unknown as they are affected by a\nmultitude of rock properties and associated state variables\n[e.g., Mavko et al., 1998; Scho\u00a8n, 1996]. The problem is\nfurther complicated by measurement errors and the resolu-\ntion loss that is inherent when solving inverse problems\n[e.g., Day-Lewis and Lane, 2004; Day-Lewis et al., 2005;\nLinde et al., 2006].\n[6] One approach to jointly invert geophysical data when\nthe site-specific petrophysical relationship is unknown, such\nas for gravity and seismic data, is to assume interfaces (i.e.,\ngeological boundaries) at the same locations, but different\nand unlinked model parameterizations within each model\nblock [Lines et al., 1988]. Such an approach is appropriate\nwhen inverting for layered models. However, most inver-\nsion algorithms use a fine model discretization where\nunique solutions are found by imposing smoothness con-\nstraints [e.g., Constable et al., 1987], damping constraints\n[e.g., Marquardt, 1970], or a priori information [e.g., Musil\net al., 2003]; therefore the method proposed by Lines et al.\n[1988] is often not applicable.\n[7] An approach that is better suited to overparameterized\nproblems is the structural approach [Haber and Oldenburg,\n1997; Gallardo and Meju, 2003, 2004; Tryggvason and\nLinde, 2006]. The idea behind the structural approach is that\ngeophysical properties in the near surface are dependent on\nthe same underlying geology and pore water. It is therefore\nreasonable to assume that changes in different physical\nproperties, at a given position, occur in the same direction.\nGallardo and Meju [2003] inverted surface based DC\nresistivity and refraction seismic data in two dimensions\nunder the constraint that the cross products of the gradients\nof the model vectors, termed the cross-gradients function by\nGallardo and Meju [2003], are zero. We adopt a similar\napproach to simultaneously invert cross-hole ERT and\nMOG GPR traveltime data in three dimensions. The prin-\nciple differences between our inversion method and the one\npresented by Gallardo and Meju [2003, 2004] are the\ndifferent geophysical methods used, that we perform\nthree-dimensional inversion instead of two-dimensional\ninversion, that the cross-gradients function provides soft\nconstraints and not hard constraints, that our regularization\noperators are based on geostatistical models and that the\nweight given to the regularization term vary during the\ninversion process, and that we use an iterative equation\nsolver compared with a direct solver that makes it possible\nto solve realistic three-dimensional problems.\n[8] The stochastic regularization operators and our im-\nplementation of the structural approach to joint inversion\nwere tested with data collected in unsaturated Sherwood\nSandstone collected close to Eggborough, North Yorkshire,\nUK [e.g., Binley et al., 2002a; West et al., 2003; Cassiani\nand Binley, 2005; Binley et al., 2005].\n[9] This paper has the following goals: (1) to compare\nresults from individual inversions based on stochastic reg-\nularization with models obtained from inversion with reg-\nularization based on traditional smoothness constraints;\n(2) to demonstrate that joint inversion of cross-hole ERT\nandMOGGPR traveltime data improves the final tomograms,\nand hence aquifer zonation, compared with tomograms\nobtained from individual inversions [e.g., Tronicke et al.,\n2004]; and (3) finally to use petrophysical models to estimate\npossible values of the electrical formation factor, water\ncontent, and effective grain radius within each zone.\n2. Inversion Method\n2.1. Formulation of the Inverse Problem\n[10] Geophysical inverse problems are often nonlinear\nand significantly more model parameters are typically used\nthan the number of model parameters that can be con-\nstrained by the geophysical data only. Nonlinear inverse\nproblems are commonly solved iteratively where the inverse\nproblem is linearized around the model of the previous\niteration and where the sensitivities of the model parameters\nwith respect to the data (i.e., the Jacobian or sensitivity\nmatrix) are used to find an updated model with improved\ndata fit. Unique solutions are found by regularizing the\ninverse problem, which is typically achieved by assuming\nthat model parameters are strongly correlated in space or\nthat the final model is close to an a priori model, which is\nthe approach chosen in this work. General literature on\nclassical discrete geophysical inverse theory includes the\nwork by Menke [1984] and Parker [1994]. The inversion\nmethod presented in this paper is developed in this tradition.\n[11] A different approach to the geophysical inverse\nproblem is to search for all possible models that honor the\ndata and available a priori information. These problems\nare typically solved with Monte Carlo methods [e.g.,\nMosegaard and Tarantola, 1995], but they are still compu-\ntationally infeasible for the application considered here and\nmany other applications of interest.\n[12] Cokriging has been an influential method to solve\nhydrological inverse problems where the relationship be-\ntween the model parameters and the data (i.e., the forward\nproblem) is linearized [Kitanidis and Vomvoris, 1983].\nWeakly nonlinear problems can be solved with an iterative\nprocedure that solves the cokriging equations at each\niteration [Yeh et al., 1996] and applications to geophysics\nhave been reported [Yeh et al., 2002].\n2 of 16\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR W12404\n[13] Our inversion method is a regularized least squares\nalgorithm that is closely related to Occam\u2019s inversion\n[Constable et al., 1987]. In contrast to Occam\u2019s inversion,\nwe define the regularization operator based on a stochastic\nmodel [Maurer et al., 1998]. We estimate the stochastic\nmodels by using EM conductivity logs collected in the\nboreholes for the ERT inversion and zero-offset profiles\n(ZOP) of GPR traveltimes where the transmitting and\nreceiving antennas are located at the same depth for the\nGPR inversion. In addition, we look for geophysical models\nthat are structurally similar by penalizing deviations from\nstructural similarity, which we quantify with the cross-\ngradients function [Gallardo and Meju, 2003]. At each\niteration, we solve the linearized inverse problem with the\niterative conjugate gradient algorithm LSQR [Paige and\nSaunders, 1982].\n2.2. Inversion of ERT Data\n[14] The following system of equations describing the\nERT inversion is to be satisfied in a least squares sense,\nwhere the upper terms in the concatenated system of\nequations correspond to the expected data fit for the updated\nmodel obtained by linearization around the previous model\nand the lower terms correspond to regularization that avoids\nexcessive and uncorrelated variations between neighboring\nmodel parameters [e.g., Paige and Saunders, 1982; Menke,\n1984; Constable et al., 1987; LaBrecque et al., 1996;\nSiripunvaraporn and Egbert, 2000]:\nesp C\ns\nd\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\nJsp\nCsm\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\n\" #\nmsp\u00fe1\nh i\n\u00bc\nesp C\ns\nd\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\nds \u0001 Fs msp\n\u0007 \b\n\u00fe Jspmsp\n\u0007 \b\nCsm\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\nmsapriori\n2\n4\n3\n5; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere mp+1\ns , mp\ns, and mapriori\ns are the model vectors at the\npresent iteration (i.e., iteration p + 1), the previous\niteration (i.e., iteration p), and the a priori model,\nrespectively. Each model vector consists of Ms elements\nof the natural logarithm of electrical conductivity (S\/m); ds\nis the data vector of Ns observed resistances (Ohm); Jp\ns\nis the Jacobian matrix with elements Jp\ns (i,j) =\n@ds\u00f0i\u00de\n@ms\u00f0j\u00de; Cd\ns\nis the corresponding data covariance matrix, which is\ndiagonal under the assumption that data errors are uncorre-\nlated, and may be estimated by performing reciprocal\nmeasurements [e.g., LaBrecque et al., 1996]; Fs(mp\ns)\ngenerates a vector of the computed resistances (i.e., the\nforward response); ep\ns is a trade-off parameter between\ndata fit and model structure; and Cm\ns is the model\ncovariance matrix. For each iteration, a line search [e.g.,\nSiripunvaraporn and Egbert, 2000] is performed to find\nthe value of ep\ns that minimizes the data misfit. The\ninversion process terminates when the target data misfit is\nreached or when no additional improvement in data misfit\nis obtained from one iteration to the next.\n[15] Our numerical solution of the forward problem,\nFs(mp\ns) , uses the Lancaster University 3D finite element\ncode R3 [Binley, 2005]. Uniform resistivity is assigned\nwithin each linear brick type element in the finite element\nmesh. The model computes the voltage field resulting from\npoint source current injection at each current electrode\nlocation. Computation of the voltage measurement for each\nfour electrode configuration is then achieved using the\nprinciple of superposition. The algorithm utilizes a diago-\nnally scaled conjugate gradient linear equation solver to\nminimize computer storage requirement. Calculation of the\nJacobian, Jp\ns, is computed using the principle of reciprocity\n[Geselowitz, 1971].\n2.3. Inversion of MOG GPR Traveltime Data\n[16] A corresponding system of equations describing the\ntraveltime inversion is to be satisfied in a least squares\nsense:\nesp C\ns\nd\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\nJsp\nCsm\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\n\" #\nmsp\u00fe1\nh i\n\u00bc\nesp C\ns\nd\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\nds \u0001 Fsp msp\n\u0007 \b\n\u00fe Jspmsp\n\u0007 \b\nCsm\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\nmsapriori\n2\n4\n3\n5 \u00f02\u00de\nwhere mp+1\ns , mp\ns , and mapriori\ns are the model vectors of the\npresent iteration, the previous iteration, and the a priori\nmodel, respectively. Each model vector consists of Ms\nelements of the slowness s (s\/m); ds is the data vector of\nNs observed traveltimes (s); Jp\ns is the Jacobian matrix\nwith elements Jp\ns (i, j) =\n@ds i\u00f0 \u00de\n@ms j\u00f0 \u00de; Cd\ns is the corresponding\ndata covariance matrix and its accurate estimation is an\nopen question, but its entries should be chosen larger than\nthe errors associated with the picking of the first arrivals\nto incorporate errors associated with mislocations of\nboreholes and simplified forward models; Fp\ns(mp\ns) are the\ncomputed traveltimes (i.e., the forward response); ep\ns is a\ntrade-off parameter between data fit and model structure\nthat is found in the same way as described for the ERT\ninversion (see section 2.2); and Cm\ns is the model\ncovariance matrix.\n[17] The forward modeling, Fp\ns(mp\ns), and computation of\nthe Jacobian, Jp\ns , are based on the nonlinear traveltime\ntomography algorithm PStomo_eq [Tryggvason et al.,\n2002]. The first arrival traveltimes are computed using the\nfinite difference (FD) algorithm time3d of Podvin and\nLecomte [1991]. This algorithm is based on the first-order\napproximation to the Eikonal equation. Podvin and Lecomte\n[1991] claimed that time3d could handle velocity contrasts\nas high as 1:10, which is sufficient for all MOG GPR\napplications. Ray tracing is performed by a posteriori back\npropagation perpendicular to the wavefronts from the\nreceivers to the transmitters [Hole, 1992]. The forward\nresponse represents the first arrivals of a given model\nregardless of if the first arrivals correspond to a direct,\nrefracted, or reflected wave. The inverse problem is non-\nlinear because the raypaths depend on the slowness struc-\nture. Thus, if the slowness structure is changed, the raypaths\nwill change as well. Therefore new raypaths must be\ncomputed after each iteration. Assuming the slowness\nstructure can be represented by cells of constant slowness,\nthe elements in the Jacobian, Jp\ns , are simply the ray length\nin each cell.\n2.4. Joint Inversion of ERT and MOG GPR\nTraveltimes\n[18] We jointly invert the ERT and GPR traveltime data\nby enforcing structural similarity quantified by the cross-\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR\n3 of 16\nW12404\ngradients function. The cross-gradients function at the\nprevious iteration is defined as [Gallardo and Meju,\n2003]:\ntp i; j; k\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc rmsp i; j; k\u00f0 \u00de \u0007 rmsp i; j; k\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere the indices i, j, and k define the model parameters\n(i.e., the logarithm of electrical conductivity and radar\nslowness, respectively) in the x, y, and z directions,\nrespectively. Both mp\ns and mp\ns are stored as vectors, and\nthe indices in the parentheses indicate the elements to\noperate upon, whereas the actual location in the model\nvectors are dependent on the scheme used to store the mesh.\nIf all three components of the cross-gradients function is\nzero for a given element, it implies that the gradients of the\ntwo models point in the same or opposite direction, or that\nthe gradients of one of the models are zero. The magnitude\nof the cross-gradients function is unchanged if calculated for\nreciprocal model properties (e.g., electrical conductivity or\nelectrical resistivity, slowness or velocity). It is recom-\nmended to invert for the logarithm of the geophysical\nproperties that vary widely in space (such as electrical\nconductivity) to ensure that changes in regions of high and\nlow values of the geophysical property of interest are given\nequal importance.

The cross-gradients\nfunction for the present iteration is estimated by a first-\norder Taylor expansion around the cross-gradients func-\ntion at the previous iteration (note that Gallardo and\nMeju [2004] linearize around their a priori models),\nshown here for\ntxp\u00fe1 ffi txp \u00fe Bxp\nmsp\u00fe1 \u0001msp\nmsp\u00fe1 \u0001msp\n\r \u000e\n; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere Bp\nx is the Jacobian of the cross-gradients function\nin the x direction with regards to the model parameters.\nEvery row of Bp\nx has six nonzero elements that can easily\nbe derived from equation (4) (see also equation (9) of\nGallardo and Meju [2004]).\n[19] In order to enforce structural similarity betweenmp+1\ns\nand mp +1\ns , equations (1)\u2013(7) are combined to a system\nof equations to minimize in a least squares sense similarly\nto equations (1) and (2):\nC\u0004d\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\nJp\nC\u00010:5m\nlBxp\nlByp\nlBzp\n2\n6666664\n3\n7777775\nmp\u00fe1\n\u0011 \u0012 \u00bc\nC\u0004d\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\nd\u0001 Fp mp\n\u0001 \u0002\u00fe Jpmp\u0001 \u0002\nC\u00010:5m mapriori\nl Bxpmp \u0001 txp\n\u0007 \b\nl Bypmp \u0001 typ\n\u0007 \b\nl Bzpmp \u0001 tzp\n\u0007 \b\n2\n66666666664\n3\n77777777775\n;\n\u00f08\u00de\nwhere\nmp\u00fe1 \u00bc\nmsp\u00fe1\nmsp\u00fe1\n\" #\n;mp \u00bc\nmsp\nmsp\n\" #\n;mapriori \u00bc\nmsapriori\nmsapriori\n\" #\n;\nd \u00bc d\ns\nds\n\u0013 \u0014\n;Fp mp\n\u0001 \u0002 \u00bc Fs msp\n\u0007 \b\nFsp m\ns\np\n\u0007 \b\n2\n64\n3\n75\nCed\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\u00bc esp Csd\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\n0\n0 esp C\ns\nd\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\n2\n4\n3\n5;\nC\u00010:5m \u00bc\nCsm\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\n0\n0 Csm\n\u0001 \u0002\u00010:5\n\" #\n; \u00f09\u00de\nand l is a large and constant weighting parameter that\nensures that the cross-gradients function of the resulting\nmodels is close to zero. The upper terms in equation (8)\nrepresent the data fit for both the ERT and GPR data, the\nsecond term represents the regularization terms for the two\ndata types, and the last three terms represent the cross-\ngradients constraints in the x, y, and z spatial directions,\nrespectively. Note that it would be possible to incorporate\nknown linear correlations between different geophysical\nmodel parameters by adding nonzero values in the off-\ndiagonal blocks of Cm\n\u00010.5. Equation (8) (as well as equations\n(1) and (2) for the individual inversions) is solved with the\nLSQR algorithm [Paige and Saunders, 1982]. LSQR is a\nconjugate gradient method where the normal equations are\nnot formed, thereby, preserving the condition number of\nequation (8). A preconditioner is applied that ensures that\nthe norm of each column of the matrix on the left-hand side\nof equation (8) is unity, which avoids unnecessary ill\nconditioning [Paige and Saunders, 1982]. An iterative\nsolution of equation (8) is suitable because we solve\nthree-dimensional problems where the dimension of equa-\ntion (8) is large and computer storage becomes a limiting\nfactor. The sparseness of equation (8) is utilized by using\nsparse solvers.\n[20] In a first stage, we perform separate inversions of the\nERT and the GPR traveltime data (see sections 2.2 and 2.3)\nto determine standard deviations of the data for which\n4 of 16\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR W12404\nsolutions with a weighted RMS of 1 can be found. This\nprocedure ensures an even weighting of the two data types.\nThe individual inversions also serve evaluation purposes. If\nno jointly inverted models (see equation (8)) with weighted\nRMS values of 1 or lower can be obtained, it suggests that\nthe constraints based on the cross-gradients function are\nphysically invalid for that application.\n2.5. Petrophysical Basis for the Joint Inversion Method\n[21] It is possible to perform joint inversion with cross-\ngradients constraints by assuming that the geometry and\nproperties of lithological units control the model parameters\n[e.g., Gallardo and Meju, 2004]. However, this assumption\nis not valid in many applications and we argue that it is\nnecessary to use petrophysical models to identify the\ncontrolling rock properties and state variables influencing\nthe model parameters and, at a later stage, define under what\nconditions the joint inversion scheme is likely to be valid.\n[22] We consider a partially saturated sand\/siltstone and\nthe expected relationship between relative permittivity and\nelectrical conductivity in such a system. This was done in\norder to understand under what conditions joint inversion of\ncross-hole ERT and GPR traveltimes with cross-gradients\nconstraints are valid when applied to unsaturated sandstone\nand to provide a petrophysical basis to evaluate the resulting\ntomograms. The radar slowness, s, and the effective\nrelative permittivity, keff, are for low-loss materials related\nas keff = s\n2c2, where c is 3 \u0007 108 m\/s. We used the inverse\nof the electrical formation factor instead of porosity when\nderiving the volume averaging equations (see Appendix A).\nThe inverse of the electrical formation factor is a good\nestimate of the effective porosity [e.g., Revil and Cathles,\n1999], i.e., it is a relevant parameter to model transport\nproperties through the connected pore volume. The effective\nrelative permittivity, keff, is given by\nkeff \u00bc 1\nF\nSnwkw \u00fe 1\u0001 Snw\n\u0001 \u0002\nka \u00fe F \u0001 1\u00f0 \u00deks\n\u0011 \u0012\n; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere kw, ka, and ks are the relative permittivities of water,\nair, and the minerals forming the rock matrix, respectively;\nF is the electrical formation factor, Sw is the water\nsaturation, and n is Archie\u2019s second exponent [e.g., Waxman\nand Smits, 1968]. In the following, we adopt the common\npractice of assuming that kw, ka, and ks are constant within\nthe volume of interest.\n[23] The electrical conductivity of the air and the mineral\ngrains can be safely neglected, but surface conduction in the\nelectrical double layer coating the grains can be significant\n[e.g., Revil and Glover, 1998]. The resulting equation for\nthe effective electrical conductivity, seff (S\/m) is\nseff \u00bc 1\nF\nSnwsw \u00fe F \u0001 1\u00f0 \u00dess\n\u0011 \u0012\n; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere sw (S\/m) is the electrical conductivity of the pore\nwater and ss (S\/m) is the surface conduction. For a granular\nmaterial with uniform grain radius, R (m), the surface\nconductivity entering equation (11) is\nss \u00bc 3\nR\nX\ns\n; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere Ss (S) is called the specific surface conductivity and\nit is fairly constant in relation to R [e.g., Leroy and Revil,\n2004]. For nonuniform grain distributions it is necessary to\nreplace R with an effective grain radius, Reff (m), e.g., by\ntaking the harmonic mean of the grain size distribution\nweighted by their relative fractions.\n[24] The petrophysical models given in equations (10)\u2013\n(12) are simplified models that include the dominant factors\nthat are likely to control the electrical and dielectric prop-\nerties of unsaturated sandstone. Alternative models are\npresent in the literature and more elaborate models may\nhave a higher predictive value but are likely to include\nparameters that are poorly known in field applications.\n2.5.1. Saturated Media\n[25] In saturated media, equations (10) and (11) simplify to\nkeff \u00bc 1\nF\nkw \u00fe F \u0001 1\u00f0 \u00deks\u00bd \n; \u00f013\u00de\nseff \u00bc 1\nF\nsw \u00fe F \u0001 1\u00f0 \u00dess\u00bd \n: \u00f014\u00de\n[26] Variations in keff are only affected by variations in F,\nwhereas variations in seff can be attributed to variations in\neither F, sw, or ss. Minimization of the cross-gradients\nfunction is for a random media (e.g., described by expo-\nnential space random functions) valid only if ss and sw are\nstrongly correlated with F or if ss can be neglected or\nassumed to be constant and sw is constant. If these con-\nditions are not fulfilled, we have to assume that the Earth\nstructure is composed of fairly homogeneous zones, where\nany variations in rock properties from one zone to another\noccurs at the same location, which is the justification for the\nmethod presented by Gallardo and Meju [2003]. This is a\nreasonable assumption when the subsurface consists of\nfairly distinct units, but is not valid for materials that are\nbetter described as continuous random fields. In this case,\nimposing a near-zero cross-gradients function will remove\nsmall-scale features. Because of resolution limitations of\ngeophysical methods, this is not necessarily a severe limi-\ntation, because we cannot expect to resolve small-scale\nvariability anyway. However, minimization of the cross-\ngradients function is clearly inappropriate in applications\nwhere variations of sw are varying gradually in a different\ndirection than the normal to geological boundaries. This\nwould be expected for many applications at contaminated\nsites, for instance, mapping of saline contaminant plumes.\n2.5.2. Unsaturated Media\n[27] In unsaturated media, the problem is further compli-\ncated by the influence of the water saturation, Sw, and\nminimizing the cross-gradients function is meaningful only\nif changes in Sw\nn is confined within fairly homogeneous\ngeological units or if the gradients of Sw\nn are normal to\ngeological boundaries (e.g., clay formations have a higher\nwater saturation than sand formations). This is often\nexpected because the capillary pressure is sensitive to grain\nsize. The same reasoning applies both to sw or ss. However,\nF can vary freely.\n2.6. Calculation of Stochastic Regularization\nOperators\n[28] Regularization through smoothness operators [e.g.,\nConstable et al., 1987] give models with strong spatial\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR\n5 of 16\nW12404\ncorrelations and regularization through damping operators\n[Marquardt, 1970] give models that are close to an initial\nmodel, but with no spatial correlation. Maurer et al. [1998]\nshowed that regularization of inverse problems based on a\nstochastic regularization operator, Cm\n\u00010.5 (e.g., equation (1)),\ncan be expressed as a combination of generalized smooth-\nness and damping regularization operators, resulting in\ngeologically more reasonable models that are consistent\nwith geostatistical descriptions of geological media. Maurer\net al. [1998] also proposed a method to generate stochastic\nregularization operators based on the von Ka\u00b4rma\u00b4n autoco-\nvariance function and determined Cm\n\u00010.5 by a grid search\nmethod. Maurer et al. [1998] applied their method to a\nsynthetic two-dimensional cross-hole tomographic seismic\nexperiment.\n[29] In most applications, only smoothness or damping\nconstraints are used because the calculation of Cm\n\u00010.5\nunder general conditions is for many three-dimensional\napplications prohibitively computationally expensive. Fur-\nthermore, the model covariance matrix, Cm, is poorly\nknown in most geophysical applications. However, good\napproximations of Cm can sometimes be obtained in near-\nsurface applications, where borehole geophysical logs can\nbe used to infer the spatial correlation structure of\nphysical properties. However, the computational problems\nof computing Cm\n\u00010.5 remain.\n[30] There are conditions under which Cm\n\u00010.5 can be\ncalculated efficiently and with small computing storage\nrequirements. The model covariance matrix Cm is a sym-\nmetrical Toeplitz matrix if the correlation function is sta-\ntionary and the grid discretization is uniform in each\ndirection [e.g., Dietrich and Newsam, 1997]. A Toeplitz\nmatrix has constant values along diagonals in each block\nand a symmetrical Toeplitz matrix is therefore defined\ncompletely by its first column. Dietrich and Newsam\n[1997] used circulant embedding of Toeplitz model covari-\nance matrices into nonnegative circulant matrices when they\ndeveloped a computationally efficient method to generate\nrandom Gaussian fields with a given correlation function.\nNowak et al. [2003] used circulant embedding of model\ncovariance matrices to efficiently perform matrix-matrix\ncomputations arising in geostatistics (e.g., in cokriging).\nHere, we use circulant embedding and the diagonalization\ntheorem for circulant matrices to compute the stochastic\nregularization operator, Cm\n\u00010.5, in a computationally efficient\nway.\n[31] Following Dietrich and Newsam [1997], Cm of a\nstationary process Y(x) with correlation function r(x)\nsampled on the uniform 1D mesh W = {x0,. . .,xm} has\nentries Cm(p,q) = r(jxp \u0001 xqj). A model covariance matrix\nCm of size m \u0007 m can be circulantly embedded into a\nsymmetric circulant matrix S of size 2M \u0007 2M by assigning\nthe following entries to the first column s of S\nsk \u00bc rk ; k \u00bc 0; :::;m;\ns2M\u0001k \u00bc rk ; k \u00bc 1; :::;m\u0001 1; \u00f015\u00de\nwhere if M > m the entries sm+1,. . .,s2M\u0001m are arbitrary or\nconveniently chosen. The next column of S can be obtained\nby shifting the first column circularly, i.e., such that the last\nelement becomes first and all other elements are shifted\nforward by one, and so on. Being circulant, S, can be\ndecomposed by using the diagonalization theorem of cir-\nculant matrices\nS \u00bc 1\n2M\nFLFH ; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere F is the standard fast Fourier transform (FFT) matrix\nof size 2M with entries Fpq = exp(2piqr\/2M), F\nH is the\nconjugate transpose of F, and L is a diagonal matrix whose\ndiagonal entries form the vector ~s = Fs [e.g., Golub and Van\nLoan, 1996]. The matrix S is nonnegative definite if all\nentries of ~s are nonnegative. These results have been\nextended to two and three dimensions; see Ranguelova\n[2002] for details.\n[32] The matrix S\u00011\/2 is for the one-dimensional case also\ncirculant and its first column can be obtained as FH~s\u00011\/2 and\nthe entries corresponding to the first column of Cm\n\u00010.5 can be\nretrieved from entries 1 to m (see equation (15)); all other\ncolumns of Cm\n\u00010.5 can be calculated by shifting the first\ncolumn circularly. In order to decrease memory require-\nments, we only store elements of Cm\n\u00010.5 that are larger than\n1% of the maximum value of Cm\n\u00010.5. In three dimensions,\nthe only difference is that we need to express s and ~s as\nthree-dimensional arrays and apply three-dimensional FFT.\nOur method to calculate Cm\n\u00010.5 is computationally efficient\nbecause we perform operations on a vector s instead of the\nmodel covariance matrix Cm.\n[33] Dietrich and Newsam [1997] proved the existence of\nnonnegative definite matrices S for different types of\nembedded covariance matrices and dimensions; they also\nprovided numerical results concerning the necessary size of\nthe matrix S in relation to the integral scales of the\nunderlying covariance model for one- and two dimensional\ndomains. In order to ensure that S is nonnegative definite in\nthree dimensions when using an exponential correlation\nfunction, we have found that it is necessary to choose M\nto be at least seven integral scales in each direction and\nchoosing sm+1,. . .,s2M\u0001m to be the corresponding values of\nr(l). The exponential correlation function is for a stationary\nthree-dimensional domain defined as\nr l\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ce\u0001l; \u00f017\u00de\nwhere c is the variance, e is the natural logarithm, and l is\ndefined as\nl \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nhx\nIx\n\r \u000e2\n\u00fe hy\nIy\n\r \u000e2\n\u00fe hz\nIz\n\r \u000e2s\n; \u00f018\u00de\nwhere hx (m), hy (m), and hz (m) are the lags in the x, y, and\nz directions, respectively, and Ix (m), Iy (m), and Iz (m) are\nthe integral scales in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.\n3. Field Example\n3.1. Field Site\n[34] The site chosen to test our joint inversion method\nand the stochastic regularization operators is located near\nEggborough, North Yorkshire, UK (Figure 1). The field site\nwas developed to study vadose zone dynamics in Sherwood\nSandstone [e.g., Binley et al., 2002a; West et al., 2003;\n6 of 16\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR W12404\nCassiani and Binley, 2005; Binley et al., 2005], which\naccounts for approximately 25% of U.K. groundwater\nabstraction [Allen et al., 1997]. The Sherwood Sandstone\nis a fluvially derived deposit consisting mainly of medium-\nand fine-grained sandstones with a small and variable\namount of clay (0\u20135%), where the fine-grained sands\nare thin beds 0.1 to 0.3 m thick, separated by much thicker\n(1\u20133 m) medium-grained units [West et al., 2003].\n[35] EM conductivity logs on the transect E3-R3-R4-E4\nare shown in Figure 2. A pronounced lateral layering is\nevident, for example, the persistent high electrical conduc-\ntivity zone at 5 m depth and the low electrical conductivity\nzones at 10 m and 14 m depth. In addition to these\nmajor zones, there is also significant small-scale variability\n(<1 m).\n[36] The experimental and theoretical semivariograms of\nthe logarithm of the EM conductivity logs are shown in\nFigure 3. The logarithm of electrical conductivity is used\nbecause this is the parameter we invert for in the ERT\ninversion (see equation (1)). The semivariograms reveal a\n\u2018\u2018hole effect\u2019\u2019 (i.e., the growth of the semivariogram is not\nmonotonic but shows some weak periodicity) [e.g., Deutsch\nand Journel, 1992], which can be explained by the fining\nupward sequences in the sandstone. However, stochastic\nregularization operators based on the hole effect model add\nlayers in the resulting inversion models at depths not\nsampled by the cross-hole geophysical data and it is\ntherefore difficult to determine what layers that are resolved\nby the cross-hole geophysical data. Instead, we used a\ngeostatistical model with a monotonic growth of the semi-\nvariogram. The stochastic regularization acts as a soft\nconstraint (e.g., see equation (1)) and deviations from a\nprescribed geostatistical model is tolerated if the cross-hole\ngeophysical data cannot be fitted otherwise. The semivario-\ngrams of the resulting tomograms might therefore reveal a\nhole effect, albeit damped, even if an exponential geo-\nstatistical model was used to calculate the stochastic regu-\nlarization operators. We modeled the large-scale behavior\nwith an exponential model with a variance, c, of 0.11\n(ln(s(S\/m))2 and integral scale in the vertical direction, Iz,\nof 3.5 m, which are the theoretical semivariograms shown in\nFigure 3. Anisotropy is modeled by assuming integral scales\nin the horizontal directions, Ix, and Iy, to be 28 m, i.e., eight\ntimes as long as in the horizontal directions in accordance\nwith Cassiani and Binley [2005]. The resulting stochastic\nregularization operator based on this model is determined\nfollowing the procedure described in section 2.6. As a\ncomparison, we performed the ERT inversion with isotropic\nand anisotropic smoothing, where we penalized roughness\nin the horizontal directions eight times as much as in the\nvertical direction.\n[37] West et al. [2003] fitted laboratory measurements of\nSherwood Sandstone with the CRIM model [e.g., Roth et\nal., 1990], which is one of the most commonly used\npetrophysical models to interpret GPR data. They estimated\nthat the effective relative permittivity, ks, of the minerals\nforming the finer lithologies of the Sherwood Sandstone is\n15 at 50 MHz compared with 5 for medium grained\nsandstone. However, the true relative permittivity of dry\nSherwood Sandstone is between 2.7 and 4.1; and the higher\neffective relative permittivities were attributed to relaxation\neffects [West et al., 2003]. Interpretations of 100 MHz zero-\noffset profiles (ZOP) in Sherwood Sandstone [Binley et al.,\n2004] were performed with a ks value of 5 to estimate field\nmoisture content. These observations are caused by the fact\nthat the first arrival data are not affected by thin layers of\nFigure 1. Areal view of the field site at Eggborough, UK\n(53.70213\u0001 latitude, \u00011.138707\u0001 longitude).\nFigure 2.

We decided to use\nthe ZOP data (Figures 4a and 4b) to determine the vertical\ncorrelation structure and assumed the same degree of lateral\nanisotropy as for the ERT data, i.e., eight. The experimental\nand theoretical semivariograms of the ZOP profiles are\nshown in Figures 4c and 4d, where the theoretical semi-\nvariogram has a variance, c, of 0.65 (s\/m)2 and a vertical\nintegral scale, Iz, of 3.5 m. It should be pointed out that\nFigure 3.

Nevertheless, they\nrepresent variability at a resolution that is appropriate for the\ninversion of the GPR traveltime data.\n3.2. ERT Inversion\n[38] The ERT data were collected in September 1999\nusing electrode arrays of 21 electrodes in E3 and E4 with\nelectrode spacing of 0.75 m. In addition, 16 surface electro-\ndes spaced 1.1 m apart were used. Transfer resistances were\nmeasured in three blocks using a 64 channel multielectrode\nCampus Instruments Tomoplex meter. In each block of\nmeasurements, the current sink (C) and potential reference\n(P) were assigned to electrodes in E3 and E4 of equal depths\n(4.5 m, 8.25 m, and 12 m depth were used). In each block of\nmeasurements, each of the remaining 56 electrodes were\nused in turn as the current source (C+) and for each current\nsource, the remaining 55 electrodes were used as the\npotential electrode (P+). A corresponding survey was con-\nducted between E1 and E2.\n[39] In order to decrease computing time and memory\nrequirements, and to ensure that only high-quality data were\nused, we only retained the 4201 measurements for which the\nrelative measurement errors estimated by reciprocal measure-\nments were less than 0.7%. However, error estimates based\non reciprocal measurements are overoptimistic because they\ndo not capture errors such as misplacement of electrodes or\ncoarse model discretizations (e.g., relative errors of 5% are\npossible if only two finite elements are placed between the\nelectrodes [LaBrecque et al., 1996], which is the case in this\nwork). It is therefore necessary to assign values to the data\ncovariance matrix, Cd\ns (equation (1)), that in addition to data\nerrors also include estimates of modeling errors. We assumed\nthat these errors correspond to an absolute error of 0.001Ohm\n(i.e., the accuracy of the measured transfer resistances) and a\n5% relative error of the measured transfer resistances, which\nis a typical magnitude of data and modeling errors in cross-\nhole ERT applications. This means that the reciprocal mea-\nsurements were used to identify high-quality data, but they\nwere not used to estimate the entries in Cd\ns.\n[40] Forward modeling used a finite element discretiza-\ntion of 0.55 m in the horizontal directions and 0.375 m in\nthe vertical direction in the area of interest, and an expo-\nnential increase in the size of the finite elements was used\noutside the area of interest to allow the electrical potential to\ndecay to zero yielding a total of 46,080 finite elements. For\nthe inverse modeling, we used 11,520 elements, which were\nobtained by grouping the elements in the x and y directions\nin patches of four. A uniform resistivity corresponding to\nthe arithmetic mean of the EM conductivity logs (62 Ohmm)\nwas used as both initial, mp\ns, and a priori model, mapriori\ns .\n[41] With an initial RMS of 11.4, the inversions based on\nthe stochastic regularization (Figure 5a) and on anisotropic\nsmoothness constraints (Figure 5b), where we penalized\nroughness in the horizontal directions eight times as much\nas in the vertical direction, reached the RMS threshold of 1\nafter three and five iterations, respectively. Both models\nhave the same sequence of conductive and resistive layers,\nbut the inversion model based on the anisotropic smoothing\nhas a more layered structure and the conductive layers are\nmore pronounced. Inversion with isotropic smoothing (not\nshown here) yielded unrealistic models (i.e., models that\nwere not layered) but the same target data misfit.\n3.3. GPR Inversion\n[42] The MOG GPR data were collected in September\n1999 with the PulseEKKO borehole radar system using\n50 MHz borehole antennae between R3 and R4 with a\nspacing of 0.25 m between 1 m and 16 m depth. A\ncorresponding survey was conducted between R1 and R2.\nWe restrict the inversions of the radar data to rays with\nangles less than 45\u0001 to avoid fast raypaths within the bore-\nholes [Peterson, 2001] and because our inversion algorithm\nassumes that the radar antennas act like a point source,\nthereby overestimating velocities when inverting data with\nhigh angular coverage [Irving and Knight, 2005]. Further-\nmore, we only used data that was collected below 2.0 m to\navoid critical refraction at the soil\/air interface [e.g., Rucker\nand Ferre\u00b4, 2004] yielding 4252 first arrivals.\n[43] Forward modeling was performed using a finite\ndifference grid of 0.375 m in all three spatial directions\nyielding a total of 101,376 finite difference blocks. For the\ninverse modeling, we used 11,264 finite difference blocks,\nwhich were obtained by grouping the blocks in the hori-\nzontal directions in patches of nine.\n[44] We assumed that the standard deviation in the data\nwas 1.5 ns because this misfit yielded models with a\nreasonable model structure and data fit. This choice of the\nstandard deviation is fairly subjective. Indeed, we can fit the\ndata to a significantly lower error level, but the resolution of\nthe resulting models are then higher than the features we can\nexpect to resolve with 50 MHz antennas (i.e., approximately\nfeatures larger than one cubic meter). The initial slowness,\nm0\ns, and a priori model, mapriori\ns , were both assumed to have\na uniform slowness of 9.1 ns\/m, which corresponds to the\nmean slowness from the ZOP GPR data (see Figures 4a\nand 4b). Both inversions converged from an initial RMS of\n2.3 to the RMS threshold of 1 after four iterations.\n[45] The model obtained with the stochastic regulariza-\ntion (Figure 5c) and the model obtained with the anisotropic\nsmoothness constrained regularization (Figure 5d) contains\nthe same major features: a low-velocity zone at 5 m depth\nand a high velocity zones at 10.5 m and 14 m in corre-\nspondence with the ZOPs (see Figures 4a and 4b). The\nmajor difference is that the model based on the anisotropic\nsmoothing show more pronounced anomalies. Inversion\nwith isotropic smoothing (not shown here) yielded unreal-\nistic models (i.e., models that were not layered) but the same\ntarget data misfit.\n[46] Regardless, of which type of regularization is pre-\nferred, Figure 5 illustrates nonuniqueness of the inverse\nproblem and that inversion with different regularization\noperators can be useful to reveal what features that are\nresolved by the data and what types of features are imposed\nby the regularization of the inverse problem.\n3.4. Joint Cross-Hole ERT and GPR Inversion\n[47] For a given application, it is necessary to perform a\nfew trials to find an appropriate weight to apply to the cross-\ngradients function. The joint inversion of the data presented\nin sections 3.2 and 3.3 was performed using the stochastic\nregularization operators andl = 1000 (see equation (8)), which\ndecreased the cross-gradients function (see equation (3))\nto approximately 10% compared with the individual inver-\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR\n9 of 16\nW12404\nsions. A higher value of l would decrease the cross-\ngradients function further but the resulting models would\nbe similar. The joint inversion reached the target data misfit\nafter six iterations. The resulting resistivity model shown in\nFigure 6a, and the velocity model is shown in Figure 6b.\nThe lower variability in the jointly inverted resistivity model\nis in accordance with the EM conductivity logs that\ntypically show variations of a factor of three (see\nFigure 2). The most striking difference for the radar models\nare that the jointly inverted models have almost constant\nvelocities outside the volume defined by boreholes R1, R2,\nR3, and R4.\n3.5. Petrophysical Implications\n[48] In this section, we derive a lithological zonation by\ncombining the inversion results from the joint inversion (see\nFigure 6) with the petrophysical models (equations (10)\nand (11)). Scatterplots of the logarithm of electrical con-\nductivity versus relative permittivity are first shown for the\nindividual inversions (Figures 7a and 7b). These plots have\nno easily determined zonation patterns. Tronicke et al.\n[2004] illustrated that seemingly uncorrelated scatterplots\nof radar attenuation and radar velocity could be grouped\ninto different zones using k means clustering, a method in\nwhich pixels are iteratively regrouped into a predefined\nnumber of clusters until the variability of the values within\neach group is minimized.\n[49] Next, we plot the corresponding scatterplots for the\njointly inverted models (Figure 7c). The scatterplot reveals\ndifferent slopes, where the parameters that correspond to\neach slope can be grouped into different zones [Gallardo\nand Meju, 2004; Tryggvason and Linde, 2006]. The result-\ning zonation can be determined without any clustering\nFigure 5. Individual inversion models based on (a) ERT inversion with stochastic regularization,\n(b) ERT inversion with anisotropic smoothness constraints, (c) MOG GPR inversion with stochastic\nregularization, and (d) MOG GPR inversion with anisotropic smoothness constraints.\n10 of 16\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR W12404\nalgorithm because of the layered structure of the inverted\nmodels. A clustering algorithm must be applied if signifi-\ncant variations occur in more than one spatial direction. We\nshould not interpret the apparent petrophysical relationships\nwithin each zone (i.e., the fairly straight lines corresponding\nto the different interpreted zones) as they represent the\ntransitions between zones (i.e., they are strongly affected\nby the applied regularization). Instead, we can only hope to\nestimate representative values of electrical conductivity and\nrelative permittivity for each zone.\n[50] Tryggvason and Linde [2006] performed synthetic\nthree-dimensional local earthquake tomography with joint\ninversion for P and S wave velocities by penalizing models\nwhere the cross-gradients function deviates from zero. In\ntheir synthetic example, the values of the inverted P and S\nwave velocities within their two anomalous zones corre-\nsponded to 70% of the maximum deviation from the\nbackground model. We make the assumption that these\nresults also apply to our inversion results from Eggborough.\nThis is a subjective choice, as we do not know if our inverse\nproblem has the same degree of overshoot as the synthetic\nexample presented by Tryggvason and Linde [2006]. The\nidentified representative values are plotted as gray circles in\nFigure 8a. Note that the values for the relative permittivity,\nk, should be 49% of the maximum deviation as we invert\nfor s and k = c2s2.\n[51] The next step is to use the petrophysical models for\nrelative permittivity (equation (10)) and electrical conduc-\ntivity (equation (11)) to infer possible values of the rock\nproperties and state variables of the identified lithological\nzones. We defined typical ranges for weakly consolidated\nsandstones and siltstones for the parameters that enter\nthese petrophysical models according to f = U[0.25\u2013\n0.35] [Binley et al., 2005], Sw = U[0,1.0], n = U[1.3,2.2],\nm = U[1.3,2.2] [Revil et al., 1998], the logarithm of Reff is\nU[\u00017.2,\u00015], sw = 0.10 S\/m [Binley et al., 2005], kw = 81,\nFigure 6. Joint inversion models: (a) ERT model with stochastic regularization and (b) radar velocity\nmodel with stochastic regularization.\nFigure 7. Scatterplots of log10 of electrical conductivity versus relative permittivity, shown for the\nmodel parameters that correspond to the transects between boreholes R1 and R2 and R3 and R4 for the\nindividually inverted models based on (a) the stochastic regularization and (b) the anisotropic smoothness\nconstraints and for the jointly inverted models based on (c) the stochastic regularization. The zonation is\nbased on the trends in the scatterplots of the models based on the joint inversion with stochastic\nregularization, where the crosses, circles, pluses, and triangles indicate zones 1\u20134, respectively.\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR\n11 of 16\nW12404\nFigure 8. (a) Four points in the scatterplots based on the jointly inverted models with stochastic\nregularization, marked with gray circles. These points are assumed to be representative of four different\nlithological zones. The solid gray line indicates the range of possible relationships based on equations\n(10)\u2013(12) and the parameter ranges specified in section 3.5. Probability density functions of (b) F, (c) q,\n(d) Reff, (e) m, and (f) n are shown for zone 1. Corresponding plots are shown for (g\u2013k) zone 2, (l\u2013p)\nzone 3, and (q\u2013u) zone 4.\n12 of 16\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR W12404\nks = 5 [Binley et al., 2004], ka = 1 and Ss = 2.5 \u0007 10\u00019 S\n[Revil and Glover, 1998], where U[\f] denotes a uniform\ndistribution. The resulting range for F = f\u0001m is 3.9 to 21. It\nis then possible to calculate the bounds of the possible\nrelationships between seff and keff by generating a large set\nof random realizations from these distributions and com-\nputing the resulting values of seff and keff. The resulting\nallowable ranges of seff and keff are given by the gray solid\nline in Figure 8a. If we assume that the petrophysical\nmodels (equations (10) and (11)) are reasonably accurate,\nit is possible to identify areas of the model where the\ninversion results indicate unphysical relationships caused\nby the inversion process and measurement errors. We see\nthat the values of the scatterplot in Figure 8a mostly fall\nwithin the allowable ranges.\n[52] Next we plotted the probability density functions of\nsome of the parameters entering equations (10)\u2013(12) for\nthe identified zones (Figures 8b\u20138u). This was achieved by\ndrawing a large number of realizations (i.e., several\nmillions) from the uniform distributions identified above\nand storing all realizations where the resulting seff and keff\nare close to the values specified for the different zones (i.e.,\nthe gray circles in Figure 8a). Parameters that have close to\na uniform distribution are poorly defined, whereas param-\neters with a well-defined peak are well defined by the joint\ninversion. For example, both f and m are poorly defined,\nbut the resulting F = f\u0001m have fairly well defined peaks\nbetween 4.5 and 6 (see for example Figure 8b). Also, the\nwater content qw = Swf is well defined (see for example\nFigure 8c). It is not possible to resolve ss using only ERT or\nGPR traveltimes. However, if ERT and GPR traveltimes are\ncombined, ss and thus R (see equation (12)) are well-\ndefined parameters (see for example Figure 8d) at low Sw\nwhen the relative contribution of ss to seff is the largest (see\nequation (11)).\n[53] Six core samples from a neighboring borehole core\n(see R5 in Figure 1) were analyzed for the electrical\nformation factor, F, and the values ranged between 2.6\nand 5 [Binley et al., 2005]. The correspondence with the\nestimated formation factors from the joint inversion (see\nFigures 8b, 8g, 8l, and 8q) is acceptable, keeping in mind\nthat the laboratory measurements, Fapp = s w\/seff, represent\napparent electrical formation factors at sw = 0.10 S\/m as ss\nis neglected, thereby underestimating F when ss is signif-\nicant. Furthermore, any disturbance during coring decreases\nthe measured F in the cores in comparison with the intact\nformation.\n[54] Binley et al. [2004] estimated that water content\nvaries in the range 0.08 and 0.18 between boreholes R3\nand R4 using GPR zero-offset profiles and assuming ks = 5.\nThese estimates represent averaged volumes with a thick-\nness of approximately 1 m and local variations in qw are\nlikely to be larger. Indeed, high-resolution time domain\nreflectometry surveying at a neighboring borehole per-\nformed during one year suggest that qw at some depth\nintervals ranged between 0.15 to 0.33 [West and Truss,\n2006]. The qw with the maximum likelihood in each zone\nare 0.26, 0.19, 0.13, and 0.12, respectively. These estimates\nhonor the lower bounds suggested by Binley et al. [2004].\nThe estimated water contents are likely to be biased\ndownward because the GPR waves travel preferably along\nthe fast zones with low saturation and the slow zones with\nhigh saturation are therefore poorly sampled and poorly\nconstrained in the inversion. The estimated ranges of qw (see\nFigures 8c 8h, 8m, and 8r) could be reduced if m and n\ncould be constrained within a smaller range.\n[55] The number of gamma ray counts is often assumed\nto be a linear function of clay content [e.g., Revil et al.,\n1998] and thus ss if the mineralogy of the clay fraction is\nfairly constant. The clay fraction in the cored borehole\n(Figure 9b) defined as the fraction of the sample with a\ngrain size smaller than 2.01 mm and gamma ray logs\n(Figure 9c) conducted in the boreholes [Binley et al., 2004]\nwere therefore used to evaluate if the differences in ss for\nzones 1 and 4 are reasonable. The highest gamma ray count\nfor all boreholes in the depth range of zone 1 corresponds to\na small anomaly with a peak of 90 cps, whereas the highest\ngamma ray count in zone 4 corresponds to a thicker\nanomaly with a peak of 133 cps (see also Figure 9c). At\nleast qualitatively, this indicates that surface conduction\neffects are more pronounced in zone 4. These results\nindicate that we can estimate F, qw, and Reff reasonably\nwell by jointly inverting ERT and GPR traveltime data in\nunsaturated sandstone.\n[56] Inversion results have resolution limitations that can\nbe quite significant when attempting quantitative interpre-\ntations [e.g., Day-Lewis and Lane, 2004; Day-Lewis et al.,\n2005], but these aspects of the inversion problem are\noutside the scope of this study. Furthermore, the petrophys-\nical models (equations (10) and (11)) are simple and do not\ncapture all variability in seff and keff. Consequently, the\nvalues of the parameters of equations (10) and (11) shown\nin Figure 8 should be considered as rough estimates, but we\nbelieve that the relative differences between the zones are\nwell resolved.\n[57] The zonation derived at Eggborough provides esti-\nmates of the geometry and the associated properties of four\ndifferent zones, but we cannot expect to resolve variations\nwithin each zone. To understand vadose zone dynamics it is\nnecessary to complement cross-hole methods with measure-\nments of higher resolution. West and Truss [2006] studied\ntemporal and spatial variations in soil moisture at a neigh-\nboring site using time domain reflectometry. They found\nthat there is significant lateral flow bypassing less perme-\nable layers. Preferential flow paths of a few decimeters\nthickness or thinner cannot be resolved using cross-hole\nERT and 50 MHz GPR radar data with the borehole spacing\nused at Eggborough.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n[58] In hydrogeophysics, geophysical information is often\nused to constrain or produce hydrogeological models [e.g.,\nHubbard et al., 2001; Cassiani and Binley, 2005]. Therefore\nit is important that geophysical models are consistent with\navailable data and the modeler\u2019s perception of the hydro-\ngeological system, as well as the parameterization used in\nthe subsequent hydrogeological modeling. Regularization\noperators in geophysical inverse problems should be chosen\nwith care because they have, for a given data misfit, a\nsignificant influence on the resulting models; this is the case\neven for joint inversion of high-resolution ERT and MOG\nGPR traveltime data (see Figure 6). It can be useful to\nperform several inversions with different regularization\noperators (i.e., different geostatistical model types and\nW12404 LINDE ET AL.: JOINT INVERSION OF CROSS-HOLE ERT AND GPR\n13 of 16\nW12404\ndifferent choices of their parameters) to assess what features\nare resolved by the data. In this work, we introduced an\nefficient way to calculate stochastic regularization operators\nbased on geostatistical models estimated from EM conduc-\ntivity logs and GPR ZOPs. It should be noted that the\nstochastic regularization operators used in this work are\naffected by both the underlying geology and the water\ncontent (see section 2.5). In applications to the saturated\nzone, the stochastic regularization operators would corre-\nspond to the underlying geology only.\n[59] There is no apparent correlation between the indi-\nvidually inverted ERT and MOG GPR tomograms from\nEggborough (see Figures 7a and 7b) making joint inversion\nwith a functional relationship infeasible. Instead, we con-\nstrained the values of the cross-gradients function (see\nequation (3)), which quantifies deviations from structural\nsimilarity, where models are defined as structurally similar\nif the gradients of the models have the same or opposite\ndirection [Gallardo and Meju, 2003].\n[60] A structural approach to joint inversion, together\nwith stochastic regularization operators, made it possible\nto jointly invert different data sets and obtain geologically\nrealistic models at a research site that was selected to study\nvadose zone dynamics in Sherwood Sandstone without\nimposing overly restrictive assumptions. The three-\ndimensional joint inversion of cross-hole ERT and MOG\nGPR traveltime data also allowed a lithological zonation of\nthe site. This zonation was not apparent from the individ-\nually inverted models. Furthermore, the joint inversion\nmade it possible to estimate probability density functions\nof the electrical formation factor, F, the water content, qw,\nand the effective grain radius of the sediments, Reff, in the\ndifferent zones. Core measurements and gamma logs were\nin qualitative agreement with the derived properties of the\ndifferent zones.\n[61] The scatterplots of the jointly inverted models\n(Figure 8a) have different slopes for different zones. These\nslopes should not be considered to represent the intrinsic\npetrophysical relationship between electrical conductivity\nand relative permittivity within each zone, as these slopes\nare strongly influenced by both the regularization used to\nsolve the inverse problem and the resolution limitations of\nthe geophysical methods used. Our three-dimensional joint\ninversion of cross-hole ERT and GPR traveltime data\nallowed us to estimate the bulk properties of each zone,\nbut it did not allow us to resolve small-scale variability\nwithin the zones.\nAppendix A: Effective Relative Permittivity\n[62] Pride [1994] used a volume-averaging approach to\nderive the following expression for the effective relative\npermittivity, keff, of two-phase media (see his equation\n(253))\nkeff \u00bc fa kw \u0001 ks\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe ks\n\u0013 \u0014\n; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere f is the porosity, a is the tortuosity, kw and ks are the\nrelative permittivities of the saturated pore space and the\nrock matrix, respectively. If the pore space is a mixture of\ntwo immiscible fluids (here water and air), we can apply a\nFigure 9.
