In most published studies that have used this approach to qualitative analysis\n(QA) the emphasis is on the conclusions reached, and little consideration is given to\nthe research process or to factors that might restrict the validity or generalizability of\nthe conclusions.\nThis paper seeks to redress the balance by presenting a \u2018pure\u2019 phenomenographic\nstudy and a critique of the research process that was applied. This critique raises some\n*Corresponding author.

Tompsett\nsignificant problems that need to be addressed if pure phenomenography is to be used\nfor future research in ICTE.\nThe most detailed level of analysis (the evaluation study) is focused on the use of\nsoftware that was developed within the NetPro II project1 to facilitate group coordi-\nnation and management for problem-based learning. The purpose of the evaluation\nwas to provide qualitative feedback to inform the next stage of design and development\nof the software. The design team was particularly interested in how the students\nperceived the tool, as opposed to whether the students understood or shared the\ndesigners\u2019 perspective. From a range of approaches that were available, phenomeno-\ngraphy appeared well suited given the limited period of time during which data could\nbe collected. The possibility of producing \u2018results\u2019 more quickly than with other\napproaches to QA was a further advantage. This study followed, as far as possible, the\npure phenomenographic process outlined in Marton and Booth (1997).\nThe critique of this research (the process study) was based on a quasi-teachback\nprocess (Kidd, 1987) between the researcher on the evaluation study and a second\nresearcher who had not taken part in the research up to this stage. In this case, the\nsecond researcher acted as an expert in qualitative analysis, and the teachback activity\nfocused on elaborating the evaluation study within this wider research framework.\nThe format of this critique allowed the research process to be explored in detail, and\nemphasized, in particular, those aspects that are distinctive to phenomenography\nrather than common across QA.\nThis critique revealed a number of weaknesses that need to be addressed in any future\nuse of phenomenography in ICTE. At the simplest level, the process needs to be revised\nto ensure that the method can track the extent to which the researchers\u2019 own values\ninfluence the interpretation and analysis of the data. From a methodological point of\nview, it must be recognized that the principles that underlie phenomenography can\nonly produce a narrow, snapshot model of what understanding might be, and provide\nlittle insight into learning.\nThe first two sections of this paper provide an introduction to phenomenography\nand the evaluation study. The central part of the paper covers the process study and\nconcentrates on four critical differences between pure phenomenography and other\napproaches to QA. Three of these are reviewed within the context of the evaluation\nstudy and challenge the validity of this approach as it is currently presented. The\nfourth arises from the process study itself and suggests that there could be strong\nlimitations to the scope of any phenomenographic research. The conclusions to the\npaper integrate these four criticisms and suggest that pure phenomenography, at least\nin ICTE, can only improve by becoming less phenomenographic.\nPhenomenography\nPhenomenography is presented as a model of qualitative research and analysis that is\ndistinct in its principles, its focus, its methods and its outcomes. The term phenom-\nenography was first defined as a distinctive approach to qualitative research and anal-\nysis by Ference Marton in an article in Instructional Science, in which he comments: \nMaking sense of \u2018pure\u2019 phenomenography in ICTE 243\nThe kind of research we wish to argue for is complementary to other kinds of research. It\nis research which aims at description, analysis, and understanding of experiences; that is,\nresearch which is directed towards experiential description. Such an approach points to a\nrelatively distinct field of inquiry which we would like to label phenomenography.\n(Marton, 1981, p. 185)\nThis approach evolved over the previous five years in a number of studies in\neducation that each focused on learning and understanding within a specific subject\n(e.g. economics; Dahlgren & Marton, 1978), and even on a specific task within that\nsubject (e.g. understanding a specific text; Marton & S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 1976a, b). The comple-\nmentary nature of this approach, for Marton, is established by distinguishing\nphenomenography from other forms of enquiry.\nPhenomenographic studies are strictly empirical and non-constructivist (Svensson,\n1997, p. 164). Despite the alignment with the empirical tradition, phenomenography\nmust be distinguished from both conventional science and educational psychology. It\nis distinguished from science, as there is no intention to describe an objective world\nthat is independent of individuals (Marton & S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 1976a). It is distinguished from\neducational psychology, as there is no intention to produce a model of the capability\nof humans to learn, perceive and\/or behave without reference to a specific context\n(Marton & Booth, 1997). In contrast, phenomenography studies the inter-relation-\nship between the individual and the objective world, and draws conclusions about\nhow individuals \u2018conceive of various aspects of their reality\u2019 (Marton, 1986, p. 42).\nAs such, phenomenography is concerned to understand the limitations to the way in\nwhich a specific aspect of the world can be experienced by individuals (S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 1996,\np. 12). Thus, Dahlgren and Marton\u2019s study of students\u2019 understanding in economics\nshould inform us about the different ways in which that part of economics could be\nperceived by any similar student, but would be irrelevant to understanding how the\nsame students understand a different subject.\nPhenomenography must also be clearly distinguished from phenomenology, which\nMarton considers to be unnecessarily abstract (Marton, 1981). Phenomenography\ndoes not accept that it is possible to separate \u2018that which is experienced from the\nexperience per se\u2019 (Marton, 1981, p. 180), while phenomenology is concerned to\nunderstand how a subjective perception of \u2018essence\u2019 can be understood as distinct\nfrom particular experiences. In addition, where phenomenology is limited to the \u2018pre-\nreflective level of consciousness \u2026 of the taken-for-granted world\u2019, a phenomeno-\ngraphic study includes \u2018both the conceptual and the experiential\u2019, both \u2018what is\nthought of\u2019 and \u2018that which is lived\u2019 (Marton, 1981, p. 180). Where phenomenologists\ndisagree (Hasselgren & Beach, 1997), they argue against, rather than for, pure\nphenomenography.\nIn later papers, the prefix \u2018pure\u2019 is added to the term phenomenography to denote\nthe research process that was originally defined (Marton, 1986). This emphasizes the\ngeneric nature of the research process and distinguishes it from other studies that\nshare the same educational focus as the original studies, irrespective of the approach\nthat is taken (Svensson, 1997, p. 164). For the remainder of this paper, phenomenog-\nraphy, unless indicated otherwise, is used to refer to the process of research and\n244 G. Alsop and C. Tompsett\nshould be read as \u2018pure\u2019 phenomenography. We shall also need to restrict our atten-\ntion to one definition, and we concentrate on Marton\u2019s view within the remainder of\nthe paper. Although some other approaches have been proposed (Hasselgren &\nBeach, 1997) these do not appear to have found favour within research in ICTE.\nThese distinctions provide a set of principles that establishes phenomenography as\na qualitative approach to research that produces statements about how individuals can\ndescribe, or equivalently be aware of, particular experiences, but phenomenography\nis not unique in this. Other approaches to QA, based on different principles (e.g.\naction research, discourse analysis, ethnomethodology, grounded theory, etc.), would\nshare the same interest in describing the ways in which individuals can understand\ntheir experience of a phenomenon in a common \u2018outer world\u2019. Phenomenography\ndistinguishes itself from each of these in practice through at least one of three charac-\nteristics that we consider in the remainder of this section: \n\u25cf the presumed objectivity of data collection;\n\u25cf the structure of the outcome space as a hierarchy; and\n\u25cf the characterization of this hierarchy as a limit to the experience of any individual.\nIn conventional phenomenography, qualitative accounts are collected, in a one-\npass approach, from a sample of subjects who share experiences of a particular\nphenomenon. The typical approach for adults is to adopt a semi-structured interview\nwith a well-structured sample, but alternative approaches are possible (Marton &\nBooth, 1997, pp. 131\u2013132). The suggestion (Booth, 1997, p. 130) that a \u2018theoretical\nsample\u2019 should be used, as in grounded theory, is not possible until the later stages of\na cyclical process of data collection. Sampling should be designed to capture diversity\nrather than to produce a statistically balanced representation. Semi-structured\ninterviews add depth to the data, but this requires sensitivity to avoid the interview\nbecoming a \u2018diagnostic discourse\u2019 (Marton & Booth, 1997, p. 130) rather than an\nexposition of the subject\u2019s own perception. Analysis of these accounts is then treated\nas a distinct stage. Few other approaches to QA would consider these accounts to be\nso unaffected by the collection process.\nThe outcome space is characterized as a hierarchically structured, multi-\ndimensional super-set of descriptions, where each subcomponent is a multi-faceted\nissue or aspect bounded by a finite range of values. This needs to be considered in\ntwo ways.\nFirstly, we can consider the outcome space as the endpoint of an empirical process.\nSince almost all other approaches to QA produce a similar super-index for the\nlanguage and terminology used by subjects, the major difference is that phenomenog-\nraphy stops at this point. As an empirical analysis should be traceable, each part of\nthe hierarchy acts as a cross-reference to the original accounts from which it stems\n(S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 1996). Entwistle (1997) clearly recognizes that further processes are necessary\nand outlines some principles for how a phenomenographic study should progress\nbeyond this. Other models of QA would certainly do so. Grounded theory (GT)\ndevelops an axial model to represent the sequential aspects of an experience or\ndecision (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), while other approaches would be more concerned\nMaking sense of \u2018pure\u2019 phenomenography in ICTE 245\nto explore normative aspects through consideration of frequency of recurrence, and\nso forth. Despite Entwistle\u2019s suggestion, phenomenographic studies are finished with\nthe production of the outcome space.\nSecondly, the outcome-space is not just a super-index to the original accounts. As\nMarton notes, \u2018The set of categories is thus stable and generalizable between\nsituations, even if the individuals \u201cmove\u201d from one category to another on different\noccasions\u2019 (1981, p. 194). In other words, for any well-defined phenomenon, there is\na fixed number of ways of conceiving of that reality (Marton, 1986, p. 42). This\nprovides strong constraints on how reality could be perceived, but within these places\nno limitations on how individuals perceive any phenomenon on any occasion. A more\ndetailed account reflects a deeper awareness of that particular phenomenon at that\ntime, but that is a statement about the account, and not about the individual them-\nselves. More complex experiences will reflect a higher level, or a more \u2018authorized\u2019\nview of the world. In education this will normally be what the students should have\nlearned (as with deep\/shallow learning). Outside education, the \u2018authorized\u2019 view\nmight reflect a higher level of scientific development, or more advanced cultural\ndevelopment (Marton, 1981, p. 184).\nDespite the significance of this super-index to phenomenography, relatively little is\nwritten about the process by which it is derived\u2014a process that is acknowledged to\nbe a \u2018\u2026 discovery procedure which can be justified in terms of results, but not in\nterms of method\u2019 (Marton & S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 1984). Instead, the phenomenographic researcher\nis expected to gain an understanding of the process from reading a sufficient number\nof case studies. Even so, apart from a description in that work, the case studies, as\npublished, provide little detail, whether the studies are from education (for example,\nBooth, 1997; Svensson, 1997; Entwistle, 1997; Marton & Pang, 2003) or from more\ndiverse fields\u2014for example, teaching and cultural analysis (Mugler & Landbeck,\n1997), public policy (Irvine, 2002), and nursing (Widang & Fridlund, 2003).\nIn summary, phenomenography presents itself as a powerful research tool that\nproduces an objective, qualitative description to represent the way that individuals\nperceive reality. For researchers in ICTE, it offers the possibility of encapsulating the\ndifferent perceptions of particular systems that are held by the designers, the educators\nand the learners, with relatively limited cost in research time. However, in doing so,\nsome critical differences exist between phenomenography and other approaches to\nQA. The evaluation study and the process study that follows allow these differences\nto be explored in practice and in theory.\nThe next section covers the use of phenomenography in the most interesting strand\nof the evaluation study. By choosing to do so, we can exclude aspects of the case study\nthat are too contextualized, and can retain sufficient details to illustrate the process\nand support the critique of the process that follows within the remainder of the paper.\nThe evaluation study\nAs already noted, the evaluation study was designed to report on the experience of\nteams of undergraduate students who were expected to collaborate on a multi-media\n246 G. Alsop and C. Tompsett\ndesign task. In this case, the students were on a multimedia design module at Level\nTwo in higher education.\nTwo software systems were available to support the students: the system that was\nthe focus of the evaluation (the tool), and the university\u2019s learning-management\nsystem. The tool provided support for coordinating work, collaboration in the\nproduction of interim designs, and submitting work to deadlines. For academic staff,\nthe tool allowed the progress of each team to be monitored efficiently and feedback\nto be given on the various components of the assignment as they were produced.\nFrom the designers\u2019 perspective, there was a particular interest in the extent to which\nthe students conceived of the tool as instrumental in supporting collaborative\nworking. The steps of the evaluation study will now be described in sequence.\nEvaluation study: data collection\nA number of factors restricted the options for data collection. Students needed to\nhave had sufficient opportunity to use the tool and deliver designs to the deadlines,\nbut their time was severely constrained, at that point in the semester, by the demands\nof other studies. Students needed to be sufficiently willing to provide feedback, but,\nethically, they could not be required to do so. For both these reasons, self-selection\nwas agreed as the only option (and was taken up by 24 students from a total of 111).\nThe period over which data were collected and the time required from each student\nwas limited as far as possible. The data were collected as written responses to a single\nprompt (Alsop & Tompsett, 2002) by the module leader. \nThe prompt did not make direct reference to collaboration:\nWe would like you to concentrate on what you, personally, could identify as a single occa-\nsion which you consider as the occasion (or one of the occasions) which was the best\neducational experience when using NetPro or Blackboard.\nWe would like you to tell us about this event. Please write about 8\u201315 sentences in the\nspace below that outline the details of how the event occurred.\nIn comparison with semi-structured interviews, the accounts are collected in\nparallel and without any further prompts. Each account is written and includes as\nmuch information and detail, or as little, as the subject chooses. Both factors should\nincrease the objective nature of the data as individual accounts. Students do not have\nany opportunity to influence each other, and the opportunity for the researchers to\ninfluence the views of the subjects is limited. The subjects are familiar with presenting\na position as a written account and so, despite the lack of any interactive \u2018discussion\u2019,\nthis approach would still be classified as a \u2018discursive\u2019 model of data collection in\nphenomenography (Hasselgren & Beach, 1997, p. 196). The collection of accounts\nin parallel eliminates the risk that details, which have been presented in early inter-\nviews, might influence the pattern or detail of subsequent interviews.\nAlthough the data were not collected conventionally, the accounts that were\ncollected showed sufficient variation in length, detail and content to support the\nphenomenographic analysis that followed. In particular, from the designers\u2019\nMaking sense of \u2018pure\u2019 phenomenography in ICTE 247\nperspective, although no direct reference had been made to collaborative learning\nwithin the prompt, collaboration did form an integral aspect of the students\u2019\naccounts of using the tool.\nEvaluation study: analysis\nEach account is one description of one experience, which is limited by what was\nperceived by the individual at the time and considered to be relevant on this one occa-\nsion. Phenomenographic analysis starts with these accounts as a \u2018pool of experiences\u2019\nand develops a single \u2018stripped\u2019 description: \u2018in which the structure and essential\nmeaning of the differing ways of experiencing the phenomenon are retained \u2026\u2019\n(Marton & Booth, 1997, p. 114). Two principles guide the analysis. Firstly, that the\ndetails within the accounts will be hierarchically structured (Booth, 1997, p. 138).\nSecondly, it is argued that the model should be as \u2018parsimonious\u2019 as possible (Marton\n& Booth, 1997, p. 125).\nThe model that was designed for the evaluation study is principally based on\nMarton and Booth (1997, p. 114), with Marton and S\u00e4lj\u00f6\u2019s (1984) work providing\nadditional clarification. The process worked through three phases of analysis, each of\nwhich could have triggered a reassessment of an earlier phase: \n1. structured reading: reading and re-reading all the experiences a number of times\nto identify the key aspects\/issues of a phenomenon;\n2. identifying variation for each aspect\/issue: reading the relevant cases to identify\nthe possible variation in the way this is experienced; and\n3. structuring experiences: \n(a) separating into levels if possible, and\n(b) clustering into an outcome space that is hierarchically structured.\n(Note: The texts use the term aspect at both a macro and detailed level of analysis. In\nthis paper the word issue is used at the highest level, and aspect for lower levels.)\nPhase 1: structured reading.   The relationship between the researcher and the\nexperiences collected from the subjects is considered to be that of an independent\nobserver. The researcher is expected to \u2018step back consciously from her [sic] own\nexperience of the phenomena and use it only to illuminate ways in which others are\ntalking of it, handling it, experiencing it, and understanding it\u2019 (Booth, 1997, p. 121).\nA separation between data collection and analysis reinforces this, and emphasizes a\nmodel of research in which the accounts are treated as objective data. In the structured\nreading phase the complete set of accounts is read and re-read a number of times\nbefore any attempt is made to make notes or begin a more formal analysis, even if this\ndoes not always appear to be followed (for example, Ramsden et al., 1993). It is argued\nthat any analysis before re-reading may \u2018fix\u2019 the analysis on aspects, or details, that\nappear important to the analyst in the first few cases, but that would not be significant\nafter reading the full set. In the evaluation study the full set was read three times.\n248 G. Alsop and C. Tompsett\nAt the end of this phase, two issues became evident: issue A, submitting work; and\nissue B, differences between the two technical systems. The next phase of analysis\ncycles through each issue in isolation from the others.\nPhase 2: identifying variation.   This phase represents a shift from identifying holistic\nissues to capturing significant variation for one issue. On each cycle (a \u2018freeze\u2019; Marton\n& Booth, 1997, p. 133), comments that are not relevant to that issue are \u2018ignored\u2019.\nThe criterion of parsimony requires that \u2018similarity of view\u2019 is captured by the researcher\nwithin a single representative phrase or statement (termed comments from this point\nonwards). Repetition of the same view is then ignored; phenomenography is intended\nto define the limits of how a phenomenon is experienced rather than what is normative.\nEach of the comments that remain can be traced back to at least one account, but is\nnow considered against the different comments that could be made about the same\nissue. If the sample is selected appropriately this will represent all the possible comments\nthat can be made (Marton & Booth, 1997, p. 120). If the accounts are processed in\ntheir original sequence and the comments retained in the sequence in which they are\nfirst noted, this restricts the opportunity to over-interpret the data at this point.\nFor issue A, submitting work, there was little difficulty in identifying relevant\ncomments by elimination; comments were excluded if they were restricted to the\nlearning-management system or made a direct comparison of common features.\nTable 1 provides the first list of comments (as noted and written by the original\nTable 1.

The richness of this variation provides a post-hoc validation of the\napproach to data collection that was used. A more detailed level of coding is intro-\nduced in the following phase.\nPhase 3: structuring experiences.   The outcome of this phase is \u2018categories of descrip-\ntion\u2019 and is well defined. The process by which this is achieved, as noted before, is\nunclear. Marton and Booth comment that these descriptions should: \nas a rule, form a hierarchy \u2026 defined in terms of increasing complexity, in which the differ-\nent ways of experiencing the phenomenon in question can be defined as subsets of the\ncomponent parts and relationships within more inclusive or complex ways of seeing the\nphenomenon. (Marton & Booth, 1997, p. 125)\nThey continue: \u2018The different ways of experiencing the phenomenon can even be\nseen as different layers of individual experiences\u2019. From this, complexity appears to\nbe as a property of an account that emphasizes the detail that is included, although\nthis phase is based on the comments themselves. This suggests that certain comments\nwould only occur within complex accounts\u2014but this does not allow for inclusiveness.\nThis seems to suggest that some comments would only occur if lower levels of\nexperience had to be there, even if relevant comments have not been included in any\none account.\nIn reality, the first part of phase 3, \u2018separating into layers if possible\u2019, involved two\ninterlinked processes. At a macro level, comments were subdivided into four aspects:\n\u2018loading a document\u2019, \u2018managing files\u2019, \u2018sharing\u2019 and \u2018feedback\u2019. These four aspects\ncould be layered by exploiting inclusiveness. For example, none of the comments on\nsharing would make sense unless the subject was already aware that files could be\nmanaged within their own workspace. The reverse would not necessarily be true.\nOn a more detailed level, a local structure was based on a more systematic coding\nof closely related expressions and, where necessary, a reapplication of the principle of\ninclusivity. As a simple illustration of systematic coding we consider the four\ncomments (a, b, c, q) from Table 1 that refer to \u2018loading a document\u2019. Coding and\nsequencing across a small set is relatively unproblematic. Table 2 presents these,\ntogether with their coding in the sequence that was provided by the researcher. The\nnumbers in the first column are taken from the final ranking that was produced.\nSpecific issues in coding are now discussed.\nWith larger and more diverse sets, such as the eight comments that were identified\nas relevant to sharing, a more detailed analysis is necessary. Table 3 presents these\ncomments arranged into six levels (6\u201311), again with the researcher\u2019s notes and\ncoding. Figure 1 shows the aspect within a hierarchical structure. Although there is\ninsufficient space to justify this sequence, it provides a good example to illustrate how\ncomplexity and inclusivity interact within a more structured coding system.\n250 G. Alsop and C. Tompsett\nFigure 1. Hierarchical structure to sharingIn this case, the comments that discuss the exchange of files (levels 6 and 7) are set\nbelow those that refer, or imply, an exchange of ideas (levels 8\u201311). Even though\nnone of the individual comments makes an explicit comparison of the two terms, the\nresearcher considered that the exchange of ideas between teams in the workspace\nrequires that the relevant files can be exchanged, but, as above, the reverse would not\nnecessarily hold true. Within the set that covered the exchange of ideas, those that\ndiscussed sharing as \u2018learning\u2019 rather than exchange seemed to represent a deeper\nlevel of understanding of the purpose of the system. The comment at level 11, which\nimplies that the \u2018design\u2019 of the tool was not fixed, also provides a good example where\ncomplexity sets this comment above the previous level.\nTable 2.

When particular values are\nconsidered to be juxtaposed, they appear on different strands of the hierarchy.\nOnce this process is completed for each aspect of the issue, then a complete hier-\narchy for this issue can be produced. An outline of the hierarchy for submitting work\nis provided in Figure 2. As the hierarchy for sharing is already included in Figure 1,\nonly the first three layers of this aspect are shown.\nFigure 2. Outline of outcome space for issue A, submitting workAt the final level, when integration occurs across all the issues, then the analysis is\ncomplete. Phenomenographers argue that this index gains predictive power: if a suit-\nable set of accounts has been collected, then any future account must also conform\nto the same structure.\nFor the evaluation study, predictive power would be of little value. The outcomes\nof this study would be relevant to any users of the same software, but the intention of\nthe designers was to alter the software and to change, and hopefully improve, the\nexperience of the students. In such a situation the designer would, ideally, be able to\npredict what will stay the same and what will change. However, a phenomenographic\nstudy cannot make such a separation!\nThis does not reduce the potential of phenomenography as a research tool. The\nstudy provides evidence that the students can perceive the tool as instrumental to\ntheir learning. However, this potential could be questioned if the process is not as\ninherently valid as is claimed. It is this issue that is considered in the process study.\nProcess study\nA teachback exercise is based on Pask\u2019s conversation theory (Pask, 1977), and\nrequires a \u2018novice\u2019 to coach an \u2018expert\u2019 through solving a problem.

The second researcher provided a critical\nframework within which the key distinctions between phenomenography and other\napproaches to QA were highlighted. When a more detailed understanding of\nphenomenography was required, additional sources were checked (for example,\nMarton, 1994), but, in terms of pure phenomenography, these either confirmed what\nwas written elsewhere or veered from the guidelines that would appear to distinguish\npure phenomenography from other approaches to QA.\nThe teachback exercise eliminated discussion of what would be sound practice in\nany approach to QA, but this section can only act as a summary of the many cycles\nof exposition, explanation, challenge, reading and re-reading of the literature that\nwere involved.

We\nconclude this section with some concerns, which are raised from the process study.\nCollection of data\nTwo inter-related factors are distinctive in data collection: single-pass collection, and\nthe independence of data collection from analysis.\nSingle-pass data collection, collecting all the data before analysis begins, is atypical\nin QA where a grounded model is developed. The starkest contrast to the single-pass\nmodel would be GT. From a GT perspective, any interaction with subjects is\ninterpreted through the mind of the researcher\u2014so data collection entails analysis. In\nalmost all other cases, data collection and analysis are recursive. In any of these\napproaches the researcher should be self-aware (Ashmore, 1989, p. 32) and\ndocument the progressive interaction of their personal understanding of the phenom-\nenon and analysis as field notes. In phenomenography the opposite is the case: data\nare collected as objective accounts, with no suggestion that subsequent interviews or\nstudies would be needed.\nThis view of data collection is a direct consequence of the model of awareness that\nunderpins phenomenography. Each subject develops their personal understanding of\na phenomenon through an unstructured sequence of experiences, but this awareness\ncannot be observed. All that is collected for analysis by the phenomenographer is a\nset of individual accounts of similar experiences. Each account is bounded by what\nthe subject is aware of on one single occasion, and this account cannot be interpreted\nas a limit on either what the individual could be aware of in the future, or, indeed,\nmight have been aware of in the past.\nIf data collection allowed an account to be revisited in order to \u2018add\u2019 to it, then this\nwould imply that the subject\u2019s account needed to conform to some standard model.\nSeparating data collection from analysis ensures that this cannot take place and\nprovides \u2018empirical data\u2019 for the analysis that follows. Even if additional cases were to\nbe collected, the protocol to be followed for any new case could not be changed.\nHowever, objectivity in data collection can only ensure that the first stage of research\nis independent of the researcher.\nIndependence of the outcomes from the researcher\nFor almost all other approaches to QA, it is presumed that the analytical phase must\nbe dependent on the researcher even if it is then argued that the conclusions become\nindependent. In such cases, it is expected, as intimated by Entwistle (1997), that\nadditional conditions must be met, as with \u2018theoretical saturation\u2019 in GT (Glaser &\nStrauss, 1967).\nThe \u2018in principle\u2019 justification for this difference appears, on first consideration, to\nbe promising. There is an evident similarity between the development of understanding\n254 G. Alsop and C. Tompsett\nin a subject, and the development of an outcome space by the analyst. Each learner\ndevelops an understanding of a phenomenon through a number of different\nexperiences, and a description of one experience is captured, in a structured format,\nand treated as objective data. Similarly, the researcher develops an understanding of\n\u2018reading an account\u2019 through experiencing \u2018reading an account\u2019 a number of times.\nThis researcher\u2019s understanding is then captured, in a structured format, as the\noutcome space and considered to be objective. However, the similarity breaks down\nwhen considered in more detail. The data that are collected from each subject is an\nindividual account. Different subjects would be expected to produce different accounts\neven if they chose to describe the same experience. On the same basis, the outcome\nspace that is produced by one researcher is a representation of their understanding,\nand different researchers should expect to produce different outcome spaces (see\nR-reference; Ashmore, 1989, p. 32). Far from justifying independence (Marton &\nBooth, 1997, p. 125), the \u2018in principle\u2019 argument suggests that the outcome space\nshould depend on the researcher.\nIf there is no additional test to justify independence, and the \u2018in principle\u2019 argument\nfails, we are able to consider the possibility that this is established through practice in\nthe specific case of the evaluation study. To do so we would need to consider each\nphase in turn, although the first two are relatively unproblematic.\nPhase 1, structured reading, is distinctive from other approaches to QA as there is\na specific requirement to \u2018hold back\u2019 from interpretation, but this particular phase\ncan be justified \u2018in principle\u2019. The phenomenographic model of understanding does\nnot require individuals to reflect on each experience, but captures the response to a\nspecific example after understanding has developed. Structured reading reflects the\nsame principle. Phase 2 is common to all forms of QA. Each will require that the\nlanguage, or rather the data, is collected, and converted into a more restricted code\n(e.g. sharing, +ve, choice, ideas). At this point, any comment or term in the code acts\nas a denotational marker that points to some text within one or more accounts.\nWhen taken in isolation, any comment, such as \u2018Loading an empty document up and\ngetting a smiley face\u2019, can be interpreted in at least three ways: as a \u2018criticism\u2019 (\u2018the\nsystem should have spotted an incorrect file\u2019), as \u2018cheating\u2019 (\u2019the system believed that\nwork was submitted on time\u2019) or even as a \u2018insight into future design changes\u2019 (\u2018the\nsystem doesn\u2019t check to see if a file is empty\u2014they could do that in the next\nversion!\u2019). However, each of these adds connotation to what it represents, and the\nmost valid interpretation should be taken from the actual accounts, and the alterna-\ntive ways of expressing related ideas in similar accounts. Up to the end of phase 2 this\nis unproblematic. Any issues of concern here would be common to any other\napproach to QA.\nOn a larger scale, where a larger number of cases have been collected, some tests\nhave been conducted to demonstrate multi-coder reliability. However, these are to\npredetermined coding frameworks, at the end of this phase, and they do not test\nwhether different phenomenographers would produce the same coding structures\nwhen presented with the same set of accounts (Sandberg, 1997, p. 205)\u2014that is,\nbefore phase 1.\nMaking sense of \u2018pure\u2019 phenomenography in ICTE 255\nPhase 3 should be more difficult to justify: by the end of this phase the outcome\nspace should be independent of the original accounts, and so the meaning of any\nterms must become \u2018fixed\u2019 by other parts of the process\u2014but must only be esta-\nblished from patterns within the data. When this phase of the evaluation study was\nreviewed during the teachback process, some anomalies arose over the concepts of\ncomplexity and inclusiveness within the final model. Two, in particular, suggested\nthat additional value systems were influencing the final model, rather than the data\nitself.\nThe first anomaly arises from the suggestion that increasing complexity should\nreflect a higher level of understanding. This problem arose when we considered a\nmore abstract coding of Table 2 (see Table 4). In this we have used abstract letters\nto ensure that the complexity of what is written is considered. When the code is\nstripped of any additional meaning, it is difficult to argue that the sequence that was\nproduced in this phase in the evaluation study is justified. The comment at level 2\nseems more complex than any of the others, and those at level 3 and 4 appear equally\ncomplex.\nOn reflection, the justification for this final sequence depended on the intended use\nof the tool as understood by the researcher conducting the analysis. As a tool for\ncollaborative learning, the inclusion of \u2018B\u2019 (\u2018cheating\u2019) has negative connotations,\nwhile the only comment that might even suggest an awareness of this possibility is \u2018A\u2019\n(off-site). Although the example seems trivial, if it exists at this level then it is certain\nto be harder to detect and justify on a more complex example. The use of an external\nvalue system, as occurred implicitly in this case, can always be justified as part of the\nanalysis, if it is acknowledged and independently justified. Once the possibility is\nraised that a value system has been introduced in this way, it might offer a different\nmotivation for treating exchange of ideas above exchange of files (as in Table 3). There\nis a risk, however, that value systems are introduced unwittingly. If the best ways of\nunderstanding a phenomenon matches the \u2018authorized\u2019 view (Marton, 1981, p. 184),\nthere is a risk that the researcher finds what they expect to find. This problem does\nnot necessarily imply that the outcomes are dependent on the researcher, nor invali-\ndate the analysis if such \u2018values\u2019 can be justified by the context of the research.\nHowever, it would seem essential to recognize that value systems that are external to\nthe data are needed to convert simple complexity into levels of understanding. Neither\nshould the justification be post hoc\u2014that only informs you about the researcher\u2019s\nvalues, or why certain \u2018authorized\u2019 versions are so readily found in educational studies.\nTable 4. Table 2 redrawn with abstract codes\nSubmitting work: loading a document Aspect: features\n4 [Loading: off-site] X: A\n3 [Loading: confirmation] X: C\n2 [Loading: confirmation and empty] X: B and C\n1 [Loading] X\n256 G. Alsop and C. Tompsett\nThe second anomaly appeared to be the dependence on the use of presumed\ninclusiveness. The comments on sharing from the evaluation study provide the most\nevident example, although this was not needed at the levels above this\u2014all the\nfeedback comments occurred in accounts that also included comments on sharing.\nHowever, if the principle is over-used, there is a risk that an implicit decision is taken\nto place a comment at an \u2018authorized\u2019 level and then justify the additional details as\na post-hoc rationalization. This would also become harder to notice in larger studies\nwith more data and \u2018discovery\u2019 as the only process of development.\nThere remains the possibility that the method of data collection that was used in\nthe evaluation study limited the complexity within the accounts. A request to produce\nmore detailed, multi-layered accounts offers no direct benefit to any subject in doing\nso. However, if this is considered to be a possibility, then so is the converse: that a\nsemi-structured approach generates accounts that are deeper (Webb, 1997). If this\nwere so, then \u2018natural\u2019 complexity could be created by a willingness to conform to the\ninterview setting (see S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 1997), rather than being a simple reflection of the\nindividual\u2019s own awareness.\nThe generalizability of the outcomes\nPhenomenography makes specific claims regarding the models that are created: once\na model is discovered, then the understanding of every suitable subject of the same\nphenomenon must fit within the model. This claim is far stronger than most approaches\nto QA, even if the scope of the terms \u2018suitable\u2019 and \u2018phenomenon\u2019 might always allow\ncounter-examples to be excluded as unsuitable or a different phenomenon.\nWhere other approaches produce a similar super-index as the endpoint of the\nresearch, they limit its meaning by the way it was produced. It is no more than a\nmulti-dimensional index to the original accounts (for example, S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 1997). Other\napproaches would require a test for validity, either at this stage, or after building a\nmore complex model (e.g. \u2018theoretical saturation\u2019 in GT; Glaser & Strauss, 1967).\nWithout any further test, and without any clear indication that the outcome space is\nindependent of both the sample used and of the researcher, an \u2018in principle\u2019 argument\nseems unlikely.\nFrom an \u2018in practice\u2019 perspective, the evaluation study is of limited assistance here.\nStudents had to have studied on the module for a sufficiently long period of time to\ncollect any relevant accounts, and beyond that point they were too committed to\nother assessments to allow a suitable empirical test; that is, to collect further cases and\ndemonstrate that they do conform to the model. However, the literature is more\nuseful here. Examples have been discovered where the categories of description have\nhad to be modified, even with examples that were central to the original work in\neducation. Following studies in other cultures in the early 1990s (Marton & Booth,\n1997, pp. 39\u201345) it became clear that concepts that are central to the early work in\nphenomenography, such as \u2018rote learning\u2019 and deep and shallow learning, have had\nto be revised in specific subjects. This problem was \u2018resolved\u2019 by refining some critical\nterms, but the need to do this suggests that other issues would need empirical testing.\nMaking sense of \u2018pure\u2019 phenomenography in ICTE 257\nThis suggests that the models are valid until they are shown to be invalid. This may\nbe a problem that is shared with scientific models of knowledge, but the evidence for\ngeneralizability, in the case of phenomenography, seems far less than claimed.\nThe scope of phenomenography\nThe three issues discussed so far (collection of data, independence of the outcomes\nfrom the researcher and generalizability of the outcomes) all arose from the evaluation\nstudy, but the process study itself raised issues. This suggests that there is a limit to\nwhat can be observed within a phenomenographic study.\nThe concern arises from the timelessness of the phenomenographic research\nmodel. Data collection captures single \u2018snapshot\u2019 images for each individual and\naccepts that this is just one account from the wider set of accounts they could have\nproduced. Since there is no attempt to \u2018assess\u2019 each student, there need be no concern\nwhether this account is typical for this student or not. Phenomenography focuses only\non the \u2018experience per se\u2019\u2014a current, individual explanation, without concern to\nunderstand previous experience as a formative process. Phenomenography describes\nwhat a deeper understanding might be, and the variation that might be experienced\n(Bowden & Marton, 1998), but not how this transfers to learning.\nA second concern, which we characterize as collaborative accounting, follows on\nfrom this and reflects one of the distinctions between phenomenography and\nphenomenology. In the evaluation study, as elsewhere, the subjects will have\ndeveloped their own awareness of this phenomenon and, on a number of occasions,\ndiscussed (accounted for) these experiences with other individuals, including\nmembers of their team. This opens up the possibility that the accounts that are\ncollected at a later stage for analysis reflect previous patterns of accounting and\nprovide an equally plausible justification for the limited number of \u2018possible experi-\nences\u2019 that are found in this study, and indeed in any phenomenographic study. A\nsimilar effect would occur if the users are instructed or informed as to how they\nshould use a system (as noted in a study by Orlikowski, 1992), and reflect this back\nas \u2018the right answer\u2019. If we even allow the possibility these effects could influence the\naccounts that are produced, then the data collected are no longer objective (Bain-\nbridge, 1981; Edwards & Mercer, 1987; S\u00e4lj\u00f6, 1996).\nConclusions\nNone of these four issues are fatal to \u2018pure\u2019 phenomenography as an approach to QA,\nbut each of them (data collection, independence of the results from the researcher,\nstatus of the results and scope of what is researched) provides a challenge.\nIn data collection, there is a thin line to be drawn between a method that will tease\nout an account of an experience, without the process corrupting or distorting the\ndata, and removing the \u2018objectivity\u2019 that is claimed.\nThe independence of the results from the research can only be established if the\nresearcher acknowledges that the analysis cannot be conducted without recognition\n258 G. Alsop and C. Tompsett\nthat \u2018their\u2019 values influence the coding that is used; that is, that independence requires\nboth self-awareness and management.\nThe claim that the outcome space must limit any future descriptions seems\nunproven and may be unnecessary. If the impact of research in ICTE is to change\nfuture experiences, then it is difficult to see why we need to generalize across systems\nthat cease to exist. However, without this claim, the outcome space of a phenomeno-\ngraphic study could be reduced to a useful cross-index. In that case, it could be\nargued, the outcome space has no special properties and \u2018pure phenomenography\u2019\noffers nothing that is new.\nFinally, the limitations on scope would appear impossible to address within\nphenomenography. Indeed, how can the development of understanding within an\ninherently social educational environment be researched if the model of knowledge\ncan only capture accounts of isolated experiences, no matter how regulated these may\nbe?\nAcknowledgements\nThe researchers would like to acknowledge the input that was made to this project by\nDr Chris Hutchison, at Kingston University, and all other members of the NetPro\nproject.
