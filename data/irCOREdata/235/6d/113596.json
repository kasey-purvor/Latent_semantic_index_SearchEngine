INTRODUCTION\nI N THE design and performance assessment of modernphotonic devices, popular numerical techniques, such as the\nbeam propagation method (BPM) or the coupled-mode theory\n(CMT), are often rendered insufficient. A viable modeling\noption then can be the three-dimensional (3-D) full-wave fi-\nnite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method based directly on\nMaxwell\u2019s equations. Typical examples of such applications in-\nclude the investigation of the in- and out-coupling of a strongly\nguiding rectangular waveguide to a planar photonic crystal\n(PPC) [1] or the study of several travelling-wave (TW) devices\nsuch as photodetectors, modulators, and phototransistors [2].\nThe high index contrast in the planar heterostructure and the\nwide-angle scattering at the horizontal plane of the PPC can\nrender the use of the BPM problematic. The CMT will be\nineffective as well since it usually considers the propagation\nof the first two guided modes and neglects the coupling to the\nradiation modes [3].\nIn the FDTD analyses of both classes of applications, the pre-\ncision in the excitation of specific eigenmodes inside the 3-D\nintegrated waveguide is of crucial importance. The absence of\nexact solutions usually leads to the employment of less accurate,\nsemianalytical techniques, such as the effective-index method,\nfor the provision of the two-dimensional (2-D) excitation pro-\nfile, which in practice results in the contamination of the simu-\nlation outcomes with unwanted modes. As a result, for the 3-D\nManuscript received March 2, 2005; revised August 16, 2005.\nThe authors are with the Advanced Technology Institute, School of Elec-\ntronics and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, UK\n(e-mail: K.Tsakmakidis@surrey.ac.uk).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/LPT.2005.859174\nFig. 1.

A suitable\nweighting component is shown for the filled points in each side of the element.\nFDTD modeling of several photonic devices that involve rect-\nangular waveguides, there is currently a need for a robust and\ngeneral methodology to excite specific eigenmodes.\nThe purpose of this letter is dual: First, we incorporate\nan accurate fully vectorial wave equation-based excitation\nscheme in the 3-D FDTD simulations that manages to launch\naccurately the desired electromagnetic eigenmodes inside\nthe planar waveguiding heterostructure. The precision in the\nmode excitation, however, is not sufficient to provide accurate\nsimulation outcomes, particularly for problems that involve\npropagation over long distances, owing to the cumulative nature\nof the induced numerical dispersion errors. To overcome that,\na highly accurate nonstandard FDTD (NS-FDTD) strategy is\nadopted which proved to require significantly less computa-\ntional resources compared to the classical Yee algorithm for the\nsame level of accuracy, as discussed in Section II.\nII. NS-FDTD SIMULATION OF THE 3-D\nDIELECTRIC WAVEGUIDE\nCritical for the NS-FDTD formulae [4], [5] is the introduc-\ntion of generalized 3-D Laplacian operators, ,\nshown in Fig. 1(a). Focusing on the derivation of , we start\nby introducing the parameters: , ,\nand , where is a real number representing the\ncell size and\n(1)\n1041-1135\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Denoting with the values of the func-\ntion at the points shown in Fig. 1(a), we have\n(2)\nSimilarly: , , with analo-\ngous expressions for the remaining points. Using series expan-\nsions like the one in (2) and the identity in (1), we obtain\n(3)\nfrom which we can define the second-order Laplacian as\n(4)\nLikewise, the second-order operators and of Fig. 1(a)\ncan be derived, as well as higher order Laplacians. We can\nefficiently combine to create an optimal\nLaplacian operator which equals a suitably weighted sum\nof and is sixth-order accurate in space for a reference\nfrequency [4]. Decomposing into finite-difference operator\nproducts and employing nonstandard stipulations, yields the\nfollowing spatial formulae that preserves the accuracy\n[Fig. 1(b)]:\n(5)\nwith [4], being the wavevector that\ncorresponds to the central frequency of the input source and\npositive weighting components fulfilling\nfor numerical consistency. For the other two di-\nrections analogous difference operators can be formed which,\nwhen inserted into the or -field updating equations, result\nin a significantly ameliorated FDTD scheme with regard to nu-\nmerical dispersion and anisotropy\nVery crucial for the simulations herein is the formulation of\nthe nonstandard uniaxial perfectly matched layer inside which\nextend the waveguide layers. For the sake of brevity, only\nthe expression for the advancement of the component (in\nHeaviside\u2013 Lorentz units) is given below\n(6)\nwith , the velocity of light in\nvacuum, and both finite-difference operators, now involving 18\ninstead of two points of a typical formulation [6].\nFor the acquisition of the 2-D excitation profiles, we note that\nin rectangular dielectric waveguides, there are no precise closed-\nFig. 2.

Also shown is the precalculated excitation profile for the generation\nof the E mode inside the rectangular waveguide.\nform expressions for the cross-sectional shape of the modes,\nowing to the peculiar behavior of the electromagnetic fields near\nthe dielectric corners where they diverge to a small degree [7]. A\nsufficiently accurate numerical way to overcome this limitation\nis via computing the - or -field eigenvectors of the vectorial\nwave equation that takes into account the polarization, vector\nproperties, and discontinuity of the guided modes at the dielec-\ntric interfaces, including the corner regions [8]. Upon obtaining\nthe 2-D field distributions in this manner, a proper spatial inter-\npolation is necessary to match the Yee grid. Such an approach\nis essential, particularly for FDTD in-coupling studies, and an\nexemplary result for the dominant component of the eigen-\nmode is illustrated in Fig. 2. The associated propagation con-\nstant is obtained from the eigenvalue of the wave equation and,\nfor sufficiently small mesh size, the error in its estimation can\nbe made very small (e.g., less than 0.01%) [8].\nThe structure on which the overall methodology was tested is\na multimode rectangular waveguide having ,\n, width m, and very small core thickness\nnm. Our choice is motivated by the use of high index con-\ntrast waveguides in existing photonic devices involving PPC or\nTW structures. The length was chosen to be sufficiently large,\nm, to check the precision in the single-mode excita-\ntion at the far end of the waveguide. We have examined the dy-\nnamical propagation of the first three modes, generated with\nthe appropriate initial profiles. The investigated spectral range\nis sufficiently above the cutoff frequency of the third eigenmode\n(to ensure accurate computation of the propagation constant and\nmode profile with the mode-solver). Using the effective-index\nmethod, we have calculated this frequency to be THz.\nFor excitation, we used Gaussian pulses modulating a sinusoidal\ncarrier of frequency THz, which coincided with\nthe reference frequency in the nonstandard difference operators.\nThe computed values of in this study were: ,\n, and\nFig. 3 shows the extracted propagation constants over the\nbandwidth of the corresponding excitation pulse, which were\nobtained by dividing the FFTs of the pulse\u2019s time history at\ntwo fixed observation points along the core [6, Ch. 15\u201316].\nNote the excellent agreement between the values predicted by\nthe NS-FDTD and the fully vectorial mode solvers for all three\neigenmodes that confirms the precision of their excitation.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In each case,\nit is found that the classical Yee scheme only attains the same\nlevels of accuracy, especially in the high-frequency range, when\nthe number of spatial grid points is increased by a factor of 6.5\nwith a corresponding significant increase in the computational\ntime, as expected. The increase in the computational time for\nthe NS-FDTD, however, is small due to the use of a 30%\nlarger time-step than the maximum allowed one in the standard\nalgorithm [4]. It is also verified that optimum performance for\nthis form of the NS-FDTD is achieved within a narrow region\naround [9], where it is always found to be more accurate\nthan the usual Yee formulation.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nAn accurate methodology, utilizing a fully vectorial excita-\ntion scheme, has been presented for the systematic analysis of\narbitrary planar heterostructures with the 3D-FDTD method.\nOwing to the considerable reduction of the numerical dispersion\nand anisotropy errors, significantly enhanced computational\nperformance has been demonstrated when the NS-FDTD for-\nmulation is used.\nREFERENCES\n[1] I.
