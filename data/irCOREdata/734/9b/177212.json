Systematic review and \neconomic modelling of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-surgical treatments \nfor women with stress urinary incontinence.

It produces high-quality research information on the \neffectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care \nin the NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health, prevent \nand treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care.\nThe research findings from the HTA programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the \nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee \n(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that they \nform a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA programme is needs led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are three \nroutes to the start of projects.\nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the \nNHS, from the public and consumer groups and from professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS \ntrusts. These suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service \nusers). The HTA programme then commissions the research by competitive tender.\nSecond, the HTA programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research \nquestions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThird, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA programme \ncommissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring together \nevidence on the value of specific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They \ncan cost from as little as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence, \nundertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer reviewed by a number of independent expert referees before \npublication in the widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series\nReports are published in the HTA journal series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA \nprogramme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and \neditors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search, appraisal \nand synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication \nof the review by others.\nThe research reported in this issue of the journal was commissioned by the HTA programme as project \nnumber 06\/41\/02. The contractual start date was in July 2007. The draft report began editorial review in \nMarch 2009 and was accepted for publication in October 2009.

Any disagreements were resolved by \nconsensus or arbitration by a third person.\nResults: Direct pairwise comparison and MTC analysis \nshowed that the treatments were more effective \nthan no treatment. Delivering PFMT in a more \nintense fashion, either through extra sessions or with \nObjectives: To assess the clinical effectiveness and \ncost-effectiveness of non-surgical treatments for \nwomen with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) through \nsystematic review and economic modelling. \nData sources: The Cochrane Incontinence Group \nSpecialised Register, electronic databases and the \nwebsites of relevant professional organisations and \nmanufacturers, and the following databases: CINAHL, \nEMBASE, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index and Social \nScience Citation Index, Current Controlled Trials, \nClinicalTrials.gov and the UKCRN Portfolio Database. \nStudy selection: The study comprised three \ndistinct elements. (1) A survey of 188 women with \nSUI to identify outcomes of importance to them \n(activities of daily living; sex, hygiene and lifestyle \nissues; emotional health; and the availability of \nservices). (2) A systematic review and meta-analysis \nof non-surgical treatments for SUI to find out which \nare most effective by comparing results of trials \n(direct pairwise comparisons) and by modelling \nresults (mixed-treatment comparisons \u2013 MTCs). A \ntotal of 88 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and Abstract\niv\nbiofeedback (BF), appeared to be the most effective \ntreatment [PFMT extra sessions vs no treatment (NT) \nodds ratio (OR) 10.7, 95% credible interval (CrI) 5.03 \nto 26.2; PFMT + BF vs NT OR 12.3, 95% CrI 5.35 to \n32.7]. Only when success was measured in terms of \nimprovement was there evidence that basic PFMT was \nbetter than no treatment (PFMT basic vs NT OR 4.47, \n95% CrI 2.03 to 11.9). Analysis of cost-effectiveness \nshowed that for cure rates, the strategy using lifestyle \nchanges and PFMT with extra sessions followed by \ntension-free vaginal tape (TVT) (lifestyle advice\u2013PFMT \nextra sessions\u2013TVT) had a probability of greater than \n70% of being considered cost-effective for all threshold \nvalues for willingness to pay for a QALY up to \u00a350,000. \nFor improvement rates, lifestyle advice\u2013PFMT extra \nsessions\u2013TVT had a probability of greater than 50% \nof being considered cost-effective when society\u2019s \nwillingness to pay for an additional QALY was more \nthan \u00a310,000. The results were most sensitive to \nchanges in the long-term performance of PFMT and \nalso in the relative effectiveness of basic PFMT and \nPFMT with extra sessions.\nLimitations: Although a large number of studies \nwere identified, few data were available for most \ncomparisons and long-term data were sparse. \nChallenges for evidence synthesis were the lack \nof consensus on the most appropriate method for \nassessing incontinence and intervention protocols that \nwere complex and varied considerably across studies.\nConclusions: More intensive forms of PFMT appear \nworthwhile, but further research is required to define \nan optimal form of more intensive therapy that is \nfeasible and efficient for the NHS to provide, along \nwith further definitive evidence from large, well-\ndesigned studies.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Lifestyle changes, such as weight \nloss, smoking cessation, etc. may reduce the risk of \nleakage but all need continued adherence. Non-\nsurgical interventions, such as pelvic floor muscle \ntraining (PFMT), biofeedback (BF), electrical \nstimulation (ES), bladder training (BT), vaginal \ncones (VCs), etc., may also require long-term \nadherence to the taught programmes in order \nto produce continued benefit. However, these \ninterventions have few adverse events compared \nwith surgical treatment. Alternatively, the leakage \ncan be contained using absorbent pads, an \nindwelling urinary catheter or, very rarely, urinary \ndiversion.\nEpidemiology and \nbackground\nStress urinary incontinence is the involuntary \nleakage of urine associated with effort or exertion, \nor on sneezing or coughing. Some women may also \nhave symptoms of urge incontinence (a sudden \ncompelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult \nto defer). Estimates of prevalence suggest that \nover 30% of women aged \u2265 40 years have SUI. \nThe annual incidence increases with age (aged \n> 65 years, annual incidence rates \u2248 9%).\nObjective\nThis study aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness \nand cost-effectiveness of non-surgical treatments \nfor women with SUI.\nMethods\nThe work comprised three distinct elements: (1) \na survey of women with SUI to identify outcomes \nof importance to them [using a Patient Generated \nIndex (PGI)]; (2) a systematic review and a meta-\nanalysis of non-surgical treatments for SUI to \nfind out which are most effective [this was done \nin two ways, by comparing results of trials (direct \npairwise comparisons) and by modelling results \n(mixed-treatment comparisons, MTCs)]; and (3) \neconomic modelling of non-surgical and surgical \ntreatments for SUI to find out which combinations \nof treatments (treatment pathways) are most cost-\neffective.\nThe survey identified areas of importance to \nwomen who suffer from SUI, using a PGI. A total of \n188 women were invited to take part.\nLiterature searching included the Cochrane \nIncontinence Group Specialised Register (last \nsearched March 2008), electronic databases (1980 \nto March 2008) and the websites of relevant \nprofessional organisations and manufacturers. \nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-\nRCTs (alternate allocation) were eligible. Random \neffects models were used to derive summary \nestimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or \ncredible intervals (CrIs) of the odds ratio (OR) for \ndichotomous variables and standardised mean \ndifference (SMD) for continuous variables (direct \npairwise comparison only).\nTo compare the cost-effectiveness of the \ntreatment pathways, a Markov model was used. \nThe model was developed using data from the \nreview of effectiveness and data on resource use \nsystematically identified as being relevant to the \nUK National Health Service (NHS). The model \nestimated cost and quality-adjusted life-years \n(QALYs) for a 40-year time horizon. Discounting \nat 3.5% was performed, as was deterministic and \nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis.\nResults\nSurvey\nOverall, 38 different areas were reported by \nrespondents on the PGI. These areas were divided \ninto four themes: activities of daily living; sex, \nhygiene and lifestyle issues; emotional health; and \nthe availability services.\nExecutive summaryExecutive summary\nx\nNumber and risk of bias \nin studies included in the \nsystematic review\nA total of 88 trials reporting data from 9721 \nwomen were identified, considering five generic \ninterventions [PFMT, ES, VCs, BT and serotonin\u2013\nnoradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) \nmedications], in many variations and combinations. \nPFMT data were split into PFMT basic (fewer than \ntwo sessions of training per month) and PFMT \nwith extra sessions (more than two sessions per \nmonth). Data were available for 37 interventions \nand 68 treatment comparisons by direct pairwise \nassessment. Mixed-treatment comparison models \ncompared 14 interventions, using data from \n55 trials (6608 women). Included studies were \ngenerally small and had short follow-up periods. \nFourteen studies (16%) reported both adequate \nrandom allocation sequence generation and \nconcealment.\nSummary of clinical \neffectiveness\nThe direct pairwise comparison analysis and the \nMTC analysis showed that the treatments were, \non average, more effective than no treatment. \nDelivering PFMT in a more intense fashion, \neither through extra sessions (more than two per \nmonth) or with BF, appears to be the most effective \ntreatment [PFMT extra sessions vs NT odds ratio \n(OR) 10.7, 95% CrI 5.03 to 26.2; PFMT + BF vs \nNT OR 12.3, 95% CrI 5.35 to 32.7]. Only when \nsuccess was measured in terms of improvement was \nthere evidence that PFMT basic was better than \nno treatment (PFMT basic vs NT OR 4.47, 95% \nCrI 2.03 to 11.9). Adverse events were uncommon \nexcept for SNRI medication.\nCosts\nThe perspective adopted for the analysis is that of \nthe UK NHS. The total costs for each intervention \nover a 3-monthly period (the cycle length of the \nMarkov model) were lifestyle changes \u00a327, PFMT \nbasic \u00a3189, PFMT with extra sessions \u00a3351, drug \ntherapy \u00a3164, tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) \n\u00a31135, colposuspension \u00a31396 and containment \nproducts \u00a339.\nUsing cure rates, a strategy of lifestyle changes and \nPFMT with extra sessions followed by TVT was the \nleast costly (\u00a31644) and the most effective (16.20 \nQALYs). The strategy that had lifestyle changes \nfollowed by TVT (LS\u2013TVT) was the most costly \n(\u00a31973).\nUsing improvement rates, the strategy LS\u2013PFMT \nbasic\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013TVT was the least costly \n(\u00a31795). The strategy LS\u2013TVT was the most costly \n(\u00a32425).\nQuality-adjusted life-years\nUsing cure rates, the strategy that used lifestyle \nchanges and PFMT basic, followed by PFMT with \nextra sessions, followed by SNRI and then TVT \n(LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013SNRI\u2013\nTVT), was the least effective (15.89 QALYs).\nUsing improvement rates, the strategy LS\u2013PFMT \nextra sessions\u2013TVT was the most effective (16.37 \nQALYs). The strategy LS\u2013TVT was the least \neffective (16.2 QALYs) (and, as noted above, the \nmost costly).\nCost-effectiveness\nFor cure rates, the strategy using lifestyle changes \nand PFMT with extra sessions followed by TVT \n(LS\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013TVT) had a probability \nof greater than 70% of being considered cost-\neffective for all threshold values for willingness to \npay for a QALY of up to \u00a350,000.\nFor improvement rates, LS\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013\nTVT had a probability of greater than 50% of being \nconsidered cost-effective when society\u2019s willingness \nto pay for an additional QALY was more than \n\u00a310,000.\nSensitivity analysis\nThe results were most sensitive to changes in the \nlong-term performance of PFMT and also in the \nrelative effectiveness of PFMT basic and PFMT \nwith extra sessions. The results were not sensitive \nto plausible changes in the structure of the model \n(use of containment products instead of using an \nactive treatment, introduction of vaginal cones \nand ES into treatment strategies). The results were \nalso insensitive to plausible changes in the age of \nwomen, time horizon, discount rates, quality-of-life \nestimates, and mortality from surgery.\nLimitations of the \ncalculations\nFew data were available for most comparisons \nand a pragmatic decision was made to include \nwomen with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) \nsymptoms, but only if the proportion of women DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\nxi\nwith UUI was less than 50% of the study sample. \nThe definitions of outcomes differed between \nstudies and the interventions were varied in terms \nof the precise nature of the exercise as well as the \nduration of therapy.\nAll of these results need to be considered cautiously \nas very few data were available for interventions. \nThe 95% central CrIs for these interventions are \nvery wide and indicate that we know very little \nabout their relative effectiveness. There were few \nlong-term data for any of the therapies. These data \nare important determinants of cost-effectiveness, \nyet little is known about how quickly symptoms \nmight return.\nOther important issues \nregarding implications\nThere may not be sufficient trained therapists to \nprovide the potentially more effective and cost-\neffective intensive non-surgical treatments. For the \nuse of these therapies to increase, staff would need \nto be recruited, trained and retained.\nWithin all of the analyses, the preferences of \nwomen for the process of care have not been \nconsidered. Women are likely to have preferences \nabout who provides the care, where the care is \nprovided, and what risks and costs they face \nthemselves.\nThe value of the non-surgical treatments depends \nupon its ability to maintain women\u2019s long-term \nadherence to therapy. How this might be achieved \nin practice will involve a complex interplay of \nfactors, including who provides the therapy, how \nit is provided, for how long, the preferences of \nwomen, and so on. These issues could not be \nfully explored in this study because of the limited \nevidence base.\nImplications for practice\nNon-surgical treatments for SUI in women are \neffective and could potentially be cost-effective, but \na judgement is required as to whether the benefits \nare worth the cost.\nThere is clear evidence that PFMT plus BF and \nPFMT with extra sessions was effective. Several \nother treatments (PFMT plus BT and BF; PFMT \nplus BF and VCs or ES) are promising, but there is \ninsufficient evidence to recommend their routine \nuse.\nThere is no evidence that PFMT basic is any better \nthan no treatment in terms of cure, although \nit does improve symptoms compared with no \ntreatment.\nThe cost-effectiveness of the non-surgical \ntreatments is dependent upon whether their short-\nterm effectiveness is sustained.\nRecommendations for \nfurther research\nConclusions are based on data from a limited \nnumber of small trials.\nMore intensive forms of PFMT appear worthwhile, \nbut research is required to define an optimal form \nof more intensive therapy that is feasible and \nefficient for the NHS to provide.\nFurther definitive evidence from large, well-\ndesigned studies is required in order to provide a \ndefinitive answer.\nAny further research on long-term outcomes, \nbenefit assessment or costs should be incorporated \ninto an updated economic evaluation, as and when \nit becomes available.\nIf an effective and efficient follow-up regimen can \nbe developed, then the incentives\/disincentives \nfaced by NHS providers may need to be \nreconsidered to aid its implementation.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Mechanisms \nthat prevent urine leakage involve the bladder, \nthe urethra and the pelvic floor muscles, together \nwith their controlling nerve pathways. The \nbladder is a highly compliant organ, allowing the \nstorage of increasing quantities of urine without \nrise in pressure, a property underpinned by \npassive stretch and active relaxation of its smooth \nmuscle (detrusor). Active central nervous control \nmechanisms in the pons and cerebrum inhibit \ndetrusor contraction despite increasing sensation \nof bladder fullness until micturition is appropriate. \nUrethral mechanisms promoting continence are \nless well understood, but are thought to involve \ntonic contraction of smooth muscle in the urethral \nwall, together with a tight seal formed by the \nurethral lining (mucosa) and the highly vascular \nsubmucosal layer. Contraction of the pelvic floor \nstriated muscles acts as an additional guarding \nmechanism, compressing the urethra and \npreventing leakage during actions that raise intra-\nabdominal pressure.\nThese features maintain continence during the \nstorage phase of the micturition cycle by ensuring \nthat bladder pressure is always lower than urethral \nclosure pressure. Incontinence is therefore likely \nto result from deficiency of urethral closure \nmechanisms and\/or involuntary detrusor activity, \naggravated by factors that chronically increase \nintra-abdominal pressure. In general, maximal \nurethral closure pressure is higher in men and \ntherefore incontinence is far more prevalent \namongst women, who are the target population for \nthis review.1\nDefinition of urinary \nincontinence\nThe symptom of urinary incontinence is defined \nas the involuntary leakage of urine,2,3 and this can \nbe subcategorised qualitatively according to the \npatient\u2019s description (Box 1).\nThis symptom categorisation2,3 is based on a \ndetailed history and provides a useful basis \nfor discussion of the problem with the patient, \nidentification of patient-centred treatment goals \nand initiation of treatment pathways.\nWhen the patient first reports the problem to \na clinician it is usual for the clinician to define \npossible causative factors and commonly associated \nproblems by further questioning, physical \nexamination and performance of simple tests. \nThe severity of incontinence and the degree of \nbother it causes the individual can be estimated \nby appropriate direct questioning, including pad \nusage, or can be quantified more objectively using \nvalidated symptom scores4 or bladder diaries.\nFurther categorisation of incontinence according \nto the underlying functional or anatomical cause \nrequires simultaneous measurement of bladder and \nrectal pressure, together with observation of urine \nloss during bladder filling. This invasive clinical \ntest, filling cystometry, requires catheterisation of \nthe bladder and is therefore generally performed \nonly when more accurate categorisation is required, \nfor example prior to surgical treatment in women \nwith MUI. This test will differentiate urodynamic \nstress incontinence (USI) due to bladder outlet \nweakness from detrusor overactivity (DO) \nincontinence due to involuntary contraction of the \nbladder muscle (Box 2).\nChapter 1  \nBackground\nStress urinary incontinence (SUI)\nInvoluntary leakage of urine associated with effort or \nexertion, or on sneezing or coughing\nUrgency urinary incontinence (UUI)\nInvoluntary leakage of urine accompanied, or imme-\ndiately preceded, by urgency, which is a sudden com-\npelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer\nMixed urinary incontinence (MUI)\nWhen complaints of both SUI and UUI coexist\nBOX 1  Symptom categories of urinary incontinenceBackground\n2\nThe test may be accompanied by radiographic \nvisualisation of the bladder outlet to qualitatively \nsubcategorise USI according to the degree \nof descent of the bladder neck on coughing \n(hypermobility) or loss of the sealing mechanism \nof the urethra (intrinsic sphincter deficiency). \nThe diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of this \nadditional imaging, together with related indices \nsuch as abdominal leak point pressure, is uncertain \nand currently not recommended for routine use by \nthe International Continence Society.2\nMost people complaining of the symptom of SUI \nwill have USI, which is demonstrable on cystometry, \nand this can be aggravated by conditions that \nchronically raise abdominal pressure, such as \nobesity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \nIn approximately 10\u201320% of cases, however, the \nsymptom of SUI can result from DO provoked by \ncoughing, for example, or from loss of bladder \ncompliance due to fibrosis or neurological disease \n(low bladder compliance). It should therefore be \nnoted that the symptom of stress incontinence does \nnot always relate to weakness of the bladder outlet \nor urethral closure mechanism.\nPractical definition of incontinence for outcome \npurposes requires a variable that can be measured \nbefore and after treatment. This presents a \nparticular problem for evidence synthesis, as there \nis a lack of consensus on the most appropriate \nmethod, with a variety of variables being used \nto define improvement or cure (Box 3). It is also \nrecognised that these variables may not capture \noutcomes of prime importance to individual \nwomen suffering SUI.\nEpidemiology and natural \nhistory\nPrevalence\nPrevalence estimates vary depending on \npopulation sampled, definition of incontinence, \nUrodynamic stress incontinence (USI)\nInvoluntary leakage of urine during increased abdomi-\nnal pressure in the absence of a detrusor contraction\nDetrusor overactivity (DO) incontinence\nLeakage of urine due to an involuntary detrusor \ncontraction\nBOX 2  Urodynamic diagnostic categorisation of urinary \nincontinence\nPatient defined\nSelf-report of outcome or change in symptom score\nQuantified\nChange in reported episodes on bladder diaries\nWeight of urine loss during exercise pad tests\nClinician defined\nDirect observation of urine loss\nCystometric diagnosis\nQuality of life defined\nChange in generic ratings, such as EQ-5D\nChange in condition-specific ratings, such as King\u2019s \nHealth Questionnaire\nBOX 3  Variables used as primary outcome measures in trials of \ntreatment of stress urinary incontinence\nseverity threshold and survey methodology.5 A \nrecent longitudinal study from one county in the \nUK surveyed a random sample of over 15,000 \ncommunity-dwelling individuals aged \u2265 40 years \nand found prevalences of 34% in women and 14% \nin men.6 These data were in line with prevalence \nrates among adults living in the UK, summarised \nfrom previous studies, showing a mean (range) \nof 40% (2\u201369%) for women and 10% (2\u201325%) \nfor men.7 These ranges were consistent with \nfindings from other developed countries, which \ndocumented rates of 10\u201372% for women and \n3\u201320% for men.7\nThe EPINCONT study surveyed over 34,000 \ncommunity-dwelling Norwegian women and \nfound that the prevalence of urinary incontinence \nincreased during young adult life, reached a broad \npeak between the ages of 45 and 55 years, and \nthen showed a further steady increase in the elderly \n(Figure 1).8\u201312 This study also found that about one-\nquarter of women with incontinence rated it as \nsevere, a proportion in line with previous reports.13\nThis study also provided differential prevalence \nrates for symptoms of stress, urge and mixed \nincontinence.10 Overall, SUI was the most common \ntype, experienced by 50% of incontinent women, \nwhereas 11% reported urgency incontinence alone \nand 36% reported mixed symptoms (Figure 1).

Studies estimate that only 15% of \nthe women identified as suffering from SUI in \ncross-sectional surveys have consulted a health \nprofessional about the problem.15,16 The reasons \nfor this are unclear but may relate to social class, \nmild symptoms, lack of bother, embarrassment, \ndisinclination towards treatment options and \nperceived lack of effective treatment.17\nNatural history\nIn comparison with the many cross-sectional \nprevalence surveys, fewer longitudinal studies have \nexamined the incidence and remission of urinary \nincontinence symptoms. One study followed a \nlarge cohort of community-dwelling middle-\naged women (mean age 46 years) for 2 years and \ndocumented an average annual incidence of new \nincontinence of 9%.18 The incidence increased \nwith age, with the majority reporting mild, non-\ndisabling leakage (Figure 2). Subanalysis of type \nof incontinence showed an annual incidence of \nfrequent or severe stress incontinence of about 2% \n(Figure 3). This study also documented a 7% annual \nremission rate among those women reporting \nurinary incontinence at baseline. Similar results \nwere found from a cohort of older, postmenopausal \nwomen (mean age 64 years), followed for 2 years, \nand a further large cohort study of women aged \n> 65 years, with rates of annual incidence for SUI \nof 9% and 9.5%, respectively, and annual remission \nrates of 7% and 8%, respectively.19,20\nA number of studies have reported questionnaire \nfollow-up of numerically smaller cohorts of younger \nwomen (mean age 26\u201330 years) before and after \ntheir first vaginal delivery and reported the annual \nincidence of new urinary incontinence to be 5%, \n1% and 4% over periods of 4, 10 and 12 years, \nrespectively.21\u201323Background\n4\nI\nn\nc\ni\nd\ne\nn\nc\ne\n \n(\n%\n)\n25\n20\n15\n10\n05\n0\n36\u201340 41\u201345 46\u201350\nAge group (years)\n51\u201355 Total\nAny\nOccasional\nFrequent\nSevere\nI\nn\nc\ni\nd\ne\nn\nc\ne\n \n(\n%\n)\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n36\u201340 41\u201345 46\u201350\nAge group (years)\n51\u201355 Total\nStress\nUrge\nMixed\nFIGURE 2  Two-year incidence of urinary incontinence by severity.

Consideration of these \nmultiple factors, together with the increasing \npreponderance of mixed urgency and stress \nincontinence symptoms, makes effective \nmanagement of the problem in the elderly more \ndifficult.14DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n5\nPostpartum SUI\nChildbearing is the main predisposing factor that \nis specific for SUI, although the exact mechanism \nof pelvic floor injury that contributes to the \ndevelopment of outlet weakness during pregnancy \nand vaginal delivery is unclear.26,27 Longitudinal \nstudies have reported that two-thirds of women \nwith SUI during their first pregnancy continue to \nhave symptoms at a follow up of 15 years. Having \nantenatal SUI doubles this risk.28 Immediately \nafter childbirth women may expect to have higher \nlevels of incontinence, which can often resolve \nspontaneously over the first 6 months. As this \nnatural resolution might confound the effect of \nany intervention, data from trials in women in the \nimmediate postpartum period were not included \nin the main body of the systematic review or in the \ncost-effectiveness analysis (results are reported in \nAppendix 20).\nOther risk factors\nIn a large population-based cross-sectional study \nof premenopausal women, high body mass index \n(BMI > 30), diabetes mellitus and previous \nurinary incontinence surgery were identified as \nsignificant risk factors for severe SUI.29 A history of \ngynaecological surgery for prolapse increased the \nrisk of developing stress leakage over twofold, and \nhysterectomy and other gynaecological procedures \nalso doubled the risk.30,31\nSignificance in terms of ill \nhealth\nEffect on well-being\nEmbarrassment associated with urinary \nincontinence may cause withdrawal from social \nsituations and reduce quality of life.32 Women \nwith a severe or frequent problem find the \nleakage distressing and socially disabling. They \nmay avoid going away from home, using public \ntransport and sexual activity.33 SUI does not \ngenerally lead to deterioration in physical health \nbut can be associated with depression and other \npsychological morbidity.33 The problem may also \nlead to withdrawal from regular physical activities, \npotentially harming general health.34\nExtent of problem in the UK\nAssuming an overall prevalence for SUI of 15% \namong women aged over 20 years, it can be \nestimated that there are 3.3 million sufferers in the \nUK.35\nCost to society\nThe high prevalence of urinary incontinence \nresults in a high overall cost of treatment and \ncontainment. Precise cost is difficult to define \nbut a recent study suggested an estimated figure \nfor combined health care, personal and societal \nexpenditure of \u00a3248 per person per year in the \nUK, which would equate to a total annual cost of \n\u00a3818M for SUI.36 A further estimate, assuming that \nSUI accounts for 50% of cases, suggested a health \ncare cost to the UK National Health Service (NHS) \nof \u00a3117M per year.37\nDescription of interventions\nThe treatment options for SUI can be classified as \nnon-surgical and surgical. Lifestyle changes, such as \nweight loss, smoking cessation, control of chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, timed voiding and \noral fluid management, may reduce risk of leakage \nbut all need continued adherence to the required \nadjustments in order to maintain response. Specific \nnon-surgical interventions, such as pelvic floor \nmuscle training and biofeedback (BF), also require \nlong-term adherence to the taught programmes \nin order to produce continued benefit. However, \nthese interventions have few or no adverse events. \nSurgical treatment, on the other hand, may have \na higher rate of benefit but has a greater risk of \ncomplications.38 Alternatively, the leakage can be \ncontained using absorbent pads, an indwelling \nurinary catheter or, very rarely, urinary diversion.\nThe choice of treatment depends on patient \npreference and professional advice and will take \ninto account factors, such as symptom severity, \ndegree of interference with lifestyle, presence of \nrelated problems and degree of comorbidity. The \nimportance of patient preference as the primary \nconsideration in selecting a particular treatment \nfor SUI was underlined by the findings of a recent \nsurvey which reported that most preferred less \ninvasive treatment and management options.39 \nFrom a health service perspective it is important \nto balance short- and long-term efficacy against \npotential adverse events and costs.\nExisting guidelines\nEpidemiological studies consistently demonstrate \nthat proportionally few women who experience \nurinary leakage approach clinicians for advice and \ntreatment.15,16 It is likely that most women first seek \nadvice from family, friends and the media and, for \nindividually varying reasons, decide to manage Background\n6\nthe problem themselves. Those who present their \nproblem to health-care professionals tend to have \nmore severe symptoms, which cause interference \nto their social activities and they are therefore \ngenerally seeking active treatment. Most countries, \nsuch as the UK, have attempted to standardise \nthe assessment and initial management of women \nwith incontinence by publication of consensus \ndocuments and guidelines.40\u201344 Despite this, \nuniformity of care remains lacking and will depend \non individual clinician opinion and local service \nprovision.\nCurrent UK NHS care pathway\nIn the UK, the first port of call is likely to be the \ngeneral practitioner (GP \u2013 primary care physician). \nAn initial assessment will document the severity \nof the problem and the degree to which it bothers \nthe women, and make sure that there are no \nmore immediate health-threatening problems. \nLifestyle advice, such as smoking cessation and \nweight loss, to modify risk factors may be offered. \nIt is then possible that conservative therapy, in \nterms of bladder training (BT) or pelvic floor \neducation and therapy, will be suggested, with \nreferral to a practice nurse, physiotherapist or \ncontinence nurse specialist. Alternatively, or if \nthese approaches subsequently fail, the woman will \nbe offered referral to secondary care, to a urologist, \nurogynaecologist or gynaecologist, depending \non local service arrangements. Such referrals \nwill mostly result in further investigation, further \nconservative treatment including the use of drugs \nand eventually the offer of surgery to those with \npredominant SUI.\nLifestyle changes\nSymptomatic SUI may be improved or cured by \nchanging lifestyle factors. This can be achieved by \ninterventions, such as weight loss, fluid restriction, \nreduction of caffeine or alcohol intake, limiting \nheavy activity, stopping smoking and treatment \nof constipation (Table 1). The effect of weight loss \nhas been most intensively studied, with evidence \nsummarised in a recent systematic review.45 \nSuccessful weight-loss programmes require \nintensive therapy, involving diet, exercise and \nbehavioural modification over a prolonged period.\nSetting\nIn the context of a consultation in primary care, the \npossible benefit of lifestyle modifications, such as \nweight loss, would be discussed and reinforced by a \npatient information leaflet, together with the offer \nof further therapeutic help. Intensive weight-loss \nprogrammes are not widely available at present but \nare most likely to be community based.\nPersonnel involved\nWeight loss or smoking cessation therapy is most \nlikely to be effective if it is supervised, preferably on \na weekly basis, by a therapist who has undergone \nrecognised training and obtained appropriate \nqualifications. Such programmes are frequently run \nas group sessions.\nCosts\nThe cost of lifestyle changes will vary according to \nthe intensity of the intervention. It might range \nfrom simple provision of information at a primary \ncare consultation with a specialist nurse (\u00a313.95)46 \nto the taking of active steps to lose weight. For \nexample, a 6-month supervised group weight-\nreduction programme with the leading commercial \nprovider in the UK, WeightWatchers\uf8e8, would \ncurrently cost \u00a3152,47 with possible additional costs \nto the individual related to dietary changes and \nexercise programme.\nPelvic floor muscle training\nRecommendations for the standardisation of \nthese treatments have been published by the UK \nChartered Society of Physiotherapists.40\nBasic pelvic floor muscle training \n(PFMT basic)\nPopularised by Arnold Kegel,48 basic pelvic floor \nmuscle training (PFMT) is generally the first-line \nnon-surgical management for SUI. The principle \nbehind this intervention is to condition and \nstrengthen the striated pelvic floor muscles in \norder to improve the urethral sphincter closure \nmechanism during provocative activity (such as \ncoughing) that raises intra-abdominal pressure. \nThere is a variety of regimens to provide PFMT \nto women. The simplest involves education about \npelvic floor structure and function, together with \ndemonstration, using digital vaginal examination \nby the therapist or woman herself, of a correct \nand effective pelvic floor muscle contraction. A \nregular exercise programme schedule is then \nagreed between the woman and her therapist, with \nintermittent checks of progress and benefit over \na 3- to 4-month period. The schedule suggested \nby Kegel was five contractions performed every \nwaking hour,49 whereas that recommended \nby recent guidelines is a sequence of eight \ncontractions three times daily.43 A summary of \ncurrent recommendations is given in Box 4.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Once benefit is established and the \nwoman is discharged from the therapist\u2019s care, a \ncontinued exercise programme is encouraged.\nBiofeedback may also be used as a training device \nor as an aid to pelvic floor muscle exercising. \nWomen use a pressure perineometer to monitor \nstrength and endurance of a series of pelvic floor \nmuscle contractions over a period of time, typically \n20\u201330 minutes, at weekly or monthly intervals.\nPlus vaginal cones\nAs an adjunct to standard pelvic floor training \nprogrammes, women can be instructed to retain \ngraded cone-shaped weights [vaginal cones \n(VCs)] within the vagina to improve pelvic floor \nmuscle strength. Starting with the lightest weight, \nwomen are advised to hold a cone in their vagina \nand prevent it from slipping out, while standing, \nmoving around or coughing. It is suggested that \nthe use of cones improves compliance with the Background\n8\nexercise schedule, individualises the exercise \nregimen, gives BF and improves knowledge of the \nfunctional anatomy of the vagina and pelvic floor. \nCones may also be used as a standalone treatment \nat home for women who do not wish to, or cannot, \naccess a health professional.50\nPlus electrical stimulation\nA further possible adjunct to PFMT is electrical \nstimulation (ES). This causes the pelvic floor \nmuscles to contract, either directly or indirectly, \nby excitation of the motor efferent fibres of the \npudendal nerve. The electrodes can be placed \non the perineal skin, within the vagina or within \nthe anus. The vaginal route is recommended with \nset stimulation parameters (Box 5). It is thought \nthat ES may be particularly useful for women who \nare unable to contract their pelvic floor muscles \nvoluntarily, or to help build up muscle strength \nprior to a supervised PFMT programme. The \nreported advantages of this intervention include \nhigh patient acceptability, little or no discomfort \nand home-managed delivery of the treatment.51\nSetting\nThese interventions are organised through \na primary care continence or physiotherapy \nservice, which may be located in a primary health \ncare centre or local hospital department. The \npatient will typically attend weekly or fortnightly \nsessions over a 3- to 4-month period, depending \non compliance and improvement. They will be \ninstructed to continue the exercise programme \nat home, during daily activity between visits to \nthe therapist, and to continue the programme \nthemselves, lifelong, after discharge from the \ntherapist\u2019s care.\nPersonnel involved\nThese treatments will be typically supervised by \na chartered physiotherapist who has undergone \neducation to degree level and has undertaken \na recognised professional training programme \nleading to the relevant professional registration. In \nsome cases sessions may be delegated to trainees \nor assistants under supervision. Alternatively, the \ntreatment will be administered by a continence \nnurse specialist who has undergone training in the \nprovision of pelvic floor exercise programmes and \nhas achieved appropriate competencies signified by \nadditional qualifications.\nCosts\nBased on Personal and Social Services \nResearch Unit (PSSRU) figures, the average \ncost for a consultation with a physiotherapist \n\u2022  Frequency: 35 Hz\n\u2022  Pulse width: 250 microseconds (0.25 milliseconds)\n\u2022  Current type: biphasic rectangular\n\u2022  Intensity: maximum tolerated\n\u2022  Duty cycle: 5 seconds on\/10 seconds off.

VCs are not provided by the UK NHS, and \nwomen would have to purchase them commercially \nat a cost of \u00a320.52 The total cost of all these \ninterventions is determined by the number of \nsessions the women receive.

The \nACA provided a copy of their e-mail distribution \nlist and members were surveyed during January \nand February 2009. Out of approximately 650 ACA \nmembers on the distribution list, 86 responded (a \n13.2% response rate). Of these, 57 provided details \nof their SUI caseload, of which 15\/57 (26.3%) \nadvisors reported that they had patients using \nduloxetine for the treatment of SUI. The number \nbeing treated was 92 out of a caseload of 1234 \npatients (7.5%); the majority of these, however, \ncame from the caseloads of two respondents.\nThe drug is generally prescribed in divided doses, \ntotalling 40\u201380 mg per day, and the response is \nassessed over a 12-week period. The relatively high \nrisk of side effects requires initial close monitoring \nby the specialist or GP.\nSetting\nThe poor tolerability profile of this drug has \nresulted in it mainly being prescribed by specialists \nthrough hospital clinics.\nYear\nP\nr\ne\ns\nc\nr\ni\np\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n \nd\ni\ns\np\ne\nn\ns\ne\nd\n \n(\n0\n0\n0\n)\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nScotland\nEngland\nNorthern Ireland\nTotal\n1123\n43,941\n2166\n47,230\n6353\n61,002\n4352\n71,707\n8648\n68,514\n4458\n81,620\n2005 (Year 1) 2006 (Year 2) 2007 (Year 3)\nFIGURE 4  Serotonin\u2013noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor prescriptions for stress urinary incontinence.

If two visits \nto the GP are included the total annual cost rises to \n\u00a3474.\nEstrogen\nEstrogens are thought to affect female continence \nthrough several modes of action, including \nmaintenance of pelvic floor musculature and \nenhancement of urethra mucosal sealing. It was \ntherefore considered that therapeutic estrogen \nsupplementation in postmenopausal women \nwould be beneficial delivered either locally or \nsystemically. Overall, there is a high level of \nevidence that oral estrogen replacement therapy \nappears to increase incontinence symptoms \namongst postmenopausal women,60\u201362 and its use \nfor this indication is therefore not recommended. \nRecent appraisal of evidence for topical vaginal \nestrogen therapy suggests that it may benefit \nwomen with incontinence but not to any consistent \ndegree,63 and it is currently only recommended \nfor women with overactive bladder symptoms that \nare associated with mucosal atrophy.43 The opinion \nfrom the expert group for the current review was in \nagreement with this guidance and so oral or topical \nestrogen were not included as a treatment option \nfor SUI.\nAdrenergic agonists\nDespite a theoretical and experimental expectation \nthat alpha-adrenergic drugs should improve \nurethral and bladder neck smooth muscle activity, \nno consistent clinical benefit was found in women \nwith stress incontinence.63,64 These drugs are \nneither licensed for this treatment indication nor \nrecommended by current guidance,43 and were \nconsidered to be very rarely used in practice by our \nexpert group. On this basis, the use of adrenergic \nagonists as a treatment option for SUI was not \nconsidered further.\nMechanical devices\nConsideration of the underlying urodynamic \nchanges that result in SUI has continued to \nencourage the design and testing of intraurethral \nor intravaginal mechanical devices to prevent \nleakage. The mechanism of action of intravaginal \ndevices is either by compression of the urethra \nagainst the inferior margin of the pubis or \nadjunctive bladder neck support with tampons \nsuch as Contrelle\u2122.65 Intraurethral devices, such \nas NEAT Expandable Tip Continence Device\u2122,66 \nand FemSoft\u2122,67 plug the urethral lumen. The \nclinical effectiveness of these devices in comparison \nwith no treatment or other conservative methods \nof managing stress incontinence was the subject of \na recent systematic review.68 This review included \nsix trials with a total of 286 participants. The \nmechanical devices used were five intravaginal \ndevices and five intraurethral devices. The included \ntrials either compared a mechanical device with \nno treatment or with an alternative device. There \nwere no published data comparing devices with \nother non-surgical interventions for the treatment \nof SUI. The published data were unsuited to meta-\nanalysis and the individual trials had small sample \nsizes and poor methodology ratings. The review \ntherefore concluded that there was insufficient \nevidence to estimate the effect of mechanical \ndevices for the treatment of women with SUI. In \nsummary, although these devices are conceptually \nattractive, they do not appear to be widely used at \npresent.49 Some further information was obtained \nfrom the previously described survey of ACA \nmembers. The respondents had a total caseload \nof 1187 women. A total of 80 women were using \nmechanical devices, although 35 (43.8%) of these \ncame from the caseload of a single respondent. The \nvast majority of devices used were vaginal devices, \nused by 78\/80 women (97.5%). The most popular \nof these was pessaries, used by 77.5% (62\/80) of \nthe women. The Contrelle Activeguard was used by \n7\/80 (8.8%) women, tampons by 4\/80 (5%) women, \nthe Incostress device by 2\/80 (2.5%) women, and \nvaginal sponges by 3\/80 (3.8%) women. The only \nnon-vaginal device used was an anal plug used by \n2\/80 (2.5%) women.\nSetting and personnel\nThese devices require a preliminary assessment by \na trained health-care professional, who will also \ninstruct the patient on their use.

It will not be considered further in this \nreview.\nPeriurethral injectable bulking agents\nStress urinary incontinence can be treated \nby periurethral injections of agents that bulk \nthe urethral wall to encourage sealing during \nurine storage and hence improve continence. \nConceptually, they occupy a \u2018grey\u2019 area between \ntruly non-surgical treatments and operations. We \nchose to define periurethral injection therapy \nas surgical treatment, as this is carried out by \nsurgically qualified clinicians, in an operating \nroom environment, with the standard precautions \nand care process that this entails. This treatment \nmodality will not therefore be included in \ntreatment pathways, but a summary of a recently \nupdated Cochrane review of the subject is included \nhere for completeness.71 This review looked at the \neffects of periurethral or transurethral injection \ntherapy for the treatment of women with urinary \nincontinence. It identified 12 relevant trials, \nincluding 1318 participants in total, and examined \neight types of injectable material (Box 6) along with \none dummy injection (saline).\nOne study comparing periurethral injection to \ndummy treatment with saline was terminated due \nto safety concerns, although early results had not \nindicated any significant difference in treatment \neffect prior to this.72 There were no relevant studies \ncomparing periurethral injection to conservative \nmanagement of urinary incontinence. However, \nin two studies comparing periurethral injection \nwith surgery, surgery was reported to result in \nsignificantly greater improvement as measured \nby clinical observation. Comparisons between \ndifferent types of agents used for periurethral \ninjection suggested a variety of new agents to be as \neffective as collagen, and porcine dermal implant \nas effective as silicone, although confidence \nintervals (CIs) were wide and longer-term data \nwere required. In general, approximately 50% \nof patients were satisfied in the short term (less \nthan 1 year) after injection therapy. The review \nconcluded that methodologically robust trials were \nneeded, particularly with longer follow-up data \nand when using non-surgical treatments, such as \nPFMT, as comparators.

They are covered by six published Cochrane \nreviews (Box 7).\nThe development of a novel theory of causation \nof SUI by Petros and Ulmsten79 has clarified the \nrationale for different surgeries. Older abdominal \ntechniques, such as Burch colposuspension and \npubovaginal sling insertion, aim to reduce mobility \nof the bladder neck and proximal urethra by \nproviding fixation to the pubis.

The tape is positioned \nwithout tension using specially designed curved \nneedles through suprapubic (TVT) or medial \ngroin (TVT-O) incisions, and an incision in the \nanterior vaginal wall beneath the mid-urethra. \nThe procedure can be performed under local \nanaesthetic and sedation or, more usually, a general \nor regional anaesthetic, and can be accomplished \nwithin a 24-hour hospital stay. The TVT variant \nalso requires cystoscopy to detect and correct \nbladder perforation. Burch colposuspension or \npubovaginal sling insertion, on the other hand, \nare open surgical procedures requiring a formal \nsuprapubic incision. They require a general \nanaesthetic and a 2- to 3-day hospital stay. The \nmain risk of all such procedures is transient (10%) \nor permanent (1%) voiding difficulty requiring \nintermittent self-catheterisation. Surgical success \nrates after 1\u20135 years of follow-up vary between 51% \nand 87% for Burch colposuspension\/pubovaginal \nsling and between 63% and 85% for TVT\/TVT-O, \naccording to definition of cure\/improvement and \nlength of follow-up.80\nSetting\nAll procedures require an appropriately equipped \nhospital or clinic environment for safe surgical \nconduct.

It is \nthe clinician\u2019s responsibility to gather evidence of \nthe severity, type and degree of bother suffered \nby the individual in order to suggest the most \nappropriate first-line treatment options for \nthe patient to consider. Selection of the initial \ntreatment is then negotiated according to patient \nchoice, clinician opinion and local availability. \nSubsequent consultations will decide on the need \nfor further trials of treatment if the initial outcome \nis unsatisfactory.

Those with modifiable lifestyle \nfactors, such as high body mass index and smoking, \nshould be encouraged and helped to address these \neither before, or concurrent with, more active \ntreatment. The selection for active treatment then \ndepends on the individual\u2019s desire and motivation, \nthe presence of comorbidity and local service \navailability.\nFor women with a predominant symptom of SUI, \neducation about their pelvic floor anatomy and \nfunction, and supervised training to improve pelvic \nfloor muscle function, are the most used first-line \ntreatments in the UK. This may sometimes be \naugmented by transvaginal ES or BF techniques, \nincluding use of VCs. To benefit from these \ntherapies, women require sufficient mobility, \nmotivation and the ability to attend frequent \ntherapy sessions. Following a trial of PFMT, the \nnext step is likely to be referral to a specialist for \nconsideration of surgery.\nMost high-level evidence for the effectiveness of \neach of these treatments is based on randomised \ntrials with set inclusion and exclusion criteria. It \nis uncertain how the results of these trials and \nmeta-analysis of multiple trials relate to individual \npatients, particularly those who would not meet the \ninclusion criteria (Table 2).\nTABLE 2  Summarised inclusion and exclusion criteria for interventions for stress urinary incontinence from studies included in relevant \nCochrane reviews\nTreatment Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria\nPFMT83 SUI\nUSI\nMore than two episodes of incontinence \nper week\n18\u201375 years\nUrinary tract infection\nIncomplete voiding\nNeurological disorders\nCognitive impairment\nBT53 Age > 35\nUrgency or MUI\nDO (urodynamic diagnosis)\nPrevious surgery for incontinence\nNeurological disease\nUrinary tract infection\nPredominant stress incontinence\nDiabetes mellitus\nInability to reach toilet unaided\nDuloxetine56 Age 30\u201380 years\nSUI\nUSI\nPregnancy\nBreastfeeding\nUrinary tract infection\nArrhythmias or liver disease\nAdvanced pelvic organ prolapse\nContinence surgery within 1 year\nPrior hip fracture or replacement\nPrior formal PFMT\nSurgery38,74\u201377 SUI\nUSI\nAge < 21 years\nAge > 65 years\nNon-ambulatory\nPregnancy\nCurrent cancer treatment\nSystemic disease affecting bladder function\nUrethral diverticulum\nRecent pelvic surgery\nGrade III incontinence\nDO\nUrinary tract infection\nSevere medical diseaseBackground\n14\nContainment options\nMethods for containment of urinary incontinence \ndo not constitute a means of treatment and are \ntherefore not included in the systematic review. \nIt is acknowledged, however, that pads are widely \nused by women in all phases of management of \ntheir incontinence problem and that methods for \nurinary diversion form the \u2018last resort\u2019 for women \nwith severe incontinence who cannot be treated, or \nhave failed repeated attempts at curative treatment, \ntypically following multiple surgical procedures. As \nsuch, the use of containment products is included \nin the economic evaluation as they form part of the \ncare that a woman might receive over her lifetime.\nAbsorbent pads\nThe most commonly used method of incontinence \nmanagement is absorbent pads. The total \nexpenditure on such products is large and, \nalthough not altering the underlying condition, \nit can be a satisfactory option for women with \nminimal or predictable leakage, or for those who \nare unsuited to treatments or have failed to benefit \nfrom treatment. The products range from thin \npanty-liners to large nappy (diaper)-type pads. \nDespite their widespread use, little research has \nbeen conducted concerning patient satisfaction or \neffectiveness, although recent evidence summarised \nin a Cochrane review does suggest that specifically \ndesigned pant insert pads are superior to those \ndesigned for menstrual loss.84,85 Containment-using \npads was also the subject of a previous UK Health \nTechnology Assessment (HTA) monograph.86\nUrinary diversion\nSome women with severe intractable incontinence \nthat has not responded to corrective methods \nof management may choose to undergo urinary \ndiversion.

All rights reserved.\n17\nT\nhe impact of SUI on individual women with \nthe condition, their families and carers, and \non the NHS, as a whole, is huge.43 There are \nmany potential methods for treating SUI which \nmight be used alone or as part of a management \nstrategy. However, while there is some evidence of \nthe relative effectiveness of individual treatments, \nthere is a lack of evidence on how the various \ninterventions might be combined into management \nstrategies. We therefore sought to identify plausible \ntreatment strategies comprising sequences of \nnon-surgical and surgical interventions. The \nclinical pathways were based on advice from \nthe health-care professionals and patient group \nrepresentatives who were involved in the study on \nwhat interventions patients could receive and the \nsequencing of the interventions. Even though the \nfocus of this study is on non-surgical treatments, \nsurgery is considered, as it may form part of a \ntreatment strategy. For example, it may be a viable \nalternative for some women seeking treatment for \nSUI. For other women, surgery may be resorted to \nif a non-surgical intervention fails to satisfactorily \nresolve symptoms.\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \n(AHRQ)90 and the third International Consultation \non Incontinence91 have published a comprehensive \nliterature review and consensus opinion of \ntreatment guidelines for therapeutic interventions \nfor SUI (the AHRQ has declared its guidelines \nobsolete). It is generally accepted that there is no \n\u2018perfect\u2019 therapy for all patients with SUI. Many \nfactors should be considered when determining \nthe optimal therapy for SUI in women. These \ninclude the aetiology and type of SUI, bladder \ncapacity, renal function, sexual function, severity \nof the leakage and degree of bother to the patient, \nthe presence of associated conditions \u2013 such as \nvaginal prolapse \u2013 or concurrent abdominal or \npelvic pathology requiring surgical correction, \nprior abdominal and\/or pelvic surgery, and, finally, \nwillingness to accept the costs, risks, morbidity \nand success (or failure) rates associated with each \nintervention.\nFor most women with SUI it is sensible to \ndiscuss first the most reversible, simplest, least \ninvasive and least expensive service-provider \ninterventions, such as lifestyle changes and \nPFMT. The clinical consensus appears to be that \nthe initial treatments for SUI involve a variety \nof non-surgical interventions, including lifestyle \nmodification, PFMT with or without BF, and other \naccessory teaching aids, such as electronic devices \nand VCs. Further strategies can be formulated, \nwhich would consist of sequences of non-surgical \nand surgical interventions. These strategies will \ntake into account the mechanism by which the \ntreatment works and will also place limits on \nthe number of retreatments allowed, based on \ncurrent concepts of the use and effectiveness \nof the different procedures. More invasive or \nexpensive interventions, such as surgery, are \npursued if the clinician and patient decide that the \ncurrent therapy is either ineffective or otherwise \nundesirable.\nThe importance of patient preference as the \nprimary consideration in selecting a particular \ntreatment for SUI was underlined by the findings \nof a recent survey which reported that most women \npreferred less invasive options.92,93 From a health \nservice perspective it is important to balance \nshort- and long-term effectiveness against the \npotential adverse events and costs. Compared with \nsurgical treatments, non-surgical treatments, such \nas lifestyle changes and physical therapies (such as \nPFMT), are associated with limited side effects and \ndo not preclude future changes in management. \nHence, non-surgical procedures have been \nconsidered to be the choice of primary treatments \nfor SUI.43 In developing the care pathways we \nhave categorised treatments as being either non-\nsurgical or surgical procedures and then considered \nhow these treatments might be combined into \nmanagement strategies for women presenting with \nSUI. While it is true that the specific treatment \nstrategy adopted will vary from woman to woman, \nbroad exemplars of specific strategies can be \ndefined. In the following sections, descriptions of \npossible management strategies of women with SUI \nare presented, which vary in terms of the type and \nsequences of treatments that might be offered.\nChapter 3  \nDefinition of the decision problemDefinition of the decision problem\n18\nDescriptions of the patient \ntreatment pathways\nFigure 5 describes the treatment pathways that are \ncompared within the economic model reported \nin Chapter 9. Potentially there are a very large \nnumber of alternative pathways that might be \nconsidered, and the pathways selected were \nderived following discussion with the health-\ncare professionals and patient representatives \ninvolved in this study. They represent plausible \ncare pathways that women might follow and might \nalso be used to infer the value of other potential \npathways not otherwise considered.\nPatient treatment pathway 1\nPatient treatment pathway 1, in Figure 5, details \none plausible strategy of care for a woman \npresenting with SUI. The first line of treatment \nthat women presenting with SUI are offered is \nlifestyle modification. Lifestyle modification may \ninvolve a combination of one or more elements. \nThese are dietary factors, reduction of caffeine \nintake, fluid intake, smoking, weight, physical \nexercise, alcohol consumption and limiting heavy \nactivity (it may be possible that there are several \nways lifestyle modifications can be performed so \nthat they can be considered as different treatments, \ntherefore allowing someone to get more than one \nlifestyle modification treatment). There are three \nstates that could arise after treatment: \u2018continent\u2019, \n\u2018incontinent\u2019 or \u2018dead\u2019 (from natural causes). The \ncontinent state includes women who report that \nthey are completely cured and those that feel that \ntheir condition has improved to the extent that \nthey require no further treatment at the present \ntime. Women could remain continent and hence \nrequire no further treatment, but some of them \nmay experience a return or worsening of symptoms \nof SUI at some point in the future and then require \nfurther treatment. The women who report that \nthey are not cured are said to be in the incontinent \nstate. These women could either require or not \nrequire further treatment. The women who require \nfurther treatment get the next treatment option \nin the pathway they are following. In the first \ncare pathway, all of the women who need further \ntreatment are offered the second line of treatment: \nphysical therapy. There are different forms of \nphysical therapies that women can receive. These \ninclude PFMT alone or in combination with an \nadjunct, such as BF, ES or VCs. Based on the \nnumber of sessions women receive, PFMT can be \nclassed as \u2018basic\u2019, when a patient has a maximum \nof two sessions per month, or \u2018PFMT with extra \nsessions\u2019, when the patient receives more than two \nsessions per month. This pathway offers only basic \nPFMT without any adjunct. Women who are not \ncured and do not receive any further treatment \nmay use containment products, such as pads, to \nmanage symptoms.\nIf women are not cured after PFMT they progress \nto the third line of treatment, which is surgery. \nThose who are not cured and need further \ntreatment are offered a second surgical procedure. \nIf the second surgical procedure does not work \nthen women use containment products until they \ndie. It is appreciated that women may also use \ncontainment products even when they are receiving \nother possible interventions. Figure 6 provides a \ndetailed description of pathway 1. Similar figures \ncould have been developed for all of the other \npathways.\nPatient treatment pathway 2\nThe treatment pathway option 2 is similar to \nthat depicted in option 1. The only difference \nis that PFMT with extra sessions is offered as an \nadditional non-surgical treatment between basic \nPFMT and surgery.\nPatient treatment pathway 3\nPathway 3 extends pathway 2 by adding a drug \ntherapy (an SNRI) between PFMT with extra \nsessions and surgery.\nPatient treatment pathway 4\nThe treatment pathway 4 is substantially the same \nas pathway 1.

For example, the commonly reported \noutcome measure in clinical trials is \u2018cure\u2019, which \nis the satisfactory resolution (or near resolution) of \nsymptoms. Using this definition usually means the \npatient self-report of the absence of incontinence. \nHowever, the ideal measure of how women are \nafter treatment should reflect the ability to lead a \nnormal social life, which may be compatible with \nimprovements in the level of continence.\nGiven that much of the available literature focuses \non clinical outcomes, which, as a result, may have \nlimited relevance to the lives of women with SUI, \nthe aim of this survey was to provide evidence on \noutcomes of importance to women.\nThe purpose of this work was to prospectively \nsurvey women with SUI to provide information on \noutcomes of importance to them; a secondary aim \nwas to identify additional outcomes that ought to \nbe collected in future primary studies and hence to \ndefine relevant outcomes for systematic reviews of \nthe literature.\nMethods\nIn order to identify the areas of importance to \nwomen who suffer from SUI, a questionnaire was \ndesigned. A Patient Generated Index (PGI)94 was \nused to allow respondents to state and evaluate \nthe areas of their life affected by SUI. In addition \nto the PGI, the questionnaire included the King\u2019s \nHealth Questionnaire,95 the EQ-5D, and questions \nrelating to socioeconomic and demographic \ninformation. The rationale for choosing the PGI \nwas that as it is an individualised instrument \u2013 it \nwould provide information on the specific concerns \nof women with SUI. In addition, these outcomes \ncould then be compared with generic measures, \nsuch as the King\u2019s Health Questionnaire and the \nEQ-5D.\nThe questionnaire\nThe PGI is an individualised patient-reported \nhealth instrument that allows the respondent \nto select, weight and rate the importance of a \nparticular health outcome.96 The PGI was designed \nwith the aim of producing a valid measure of \noutcome that reflected areas of importance to \npatients\u2019 lives.94 The PGI involves the respondent \ndeciding what factors are important to her. \nExamples of the types of factors that may be \nimportant are included to provide guidance. The \naim of the PGI is therefore to capture the diverse \nrange of concerns or priorities of respondents. \nUsing the PGI, respondents can vary the weight \nthey attach to these concerns or priorities, which \nprovides researchers with an insight into each \nrespondent\u2019s viewpoint. An overall score for the \nPGI for each respondent can then be calculated by \nmultiplying the rating for each health area by the \nproportion of points allocated to that particular \narea.\nThe PGI is completed in three stages. In the first \nstage, respondents are asked to identify up to five \nareas of their life that are affected by their SUI. \nRespondents are given a list of outcomes to act \nas prompts to help them think about which areas \nof their life might be affected by their condition. \nRespondents can then choose from these options or \nprovide their own examples. In addition to the five \nboxes, there is a sixth box that enables respondents \nto rate all other areas of their life affected by their \nSUI. Examples of the factors to include as prompts \non the PGI were drawn from three sources. The \nfirst of these was the King\u2019s Health Questionnaire,95 \nChapter 4  \nIdentification of outcomes of importance to \nwomen with stress urinary incontinenceOutcomes of importance to women with SUI\n24\nwhich was used to generate a list of outcomes \nunder the broad headings of: \u2018role limitations\u2019, \n\u2018physical limitations\u2019, \u2018social limitations\u2019 and \n\u2018personal relationships and emotions\u2019. These \noutcomes were supplemented from Cochrane \nreviews of non-surgical treatments.56,75,83,97 Finally, \na general literature search was also conducted, \nalthough this did not provide further additions \nto the 17 different outcomes identified from the \nKing\u2019s Health Questionnaire and the Cochrane \nreviews. These outcomes were then narrowed \ndown to broad categories of those considered most \nrelevant by members of the project team. These \nwere \u2018work\u2019, \u2018household tasks\u2019, \u2018social activities\u2019, \n\u2018feeling depressed\/anxious\u2019, \u2018personal hygiene\u2019 and \n\u2018affecting sleep\u2019. In addition to the methods used \nto generate the prompt list, further qualitative \nwork could have been conducted. This could have \nincluded a focus group of women with SUI to \nfurther refine the areas to include in the prompt \nlist. This is an area that could be considered in \nfuture use of the PGI.\nIn stage two of the PGI, respondents were asked to \nscore each area listed in stage one of the PGI on a \nscale ranging from 0 to 6. The score given in stage \ntwo was intended to reflect how the individual was \naffected by their SUI in the past month. A score of \n0 would signify that the effect on their life was as \nbad as it could possibly be and a score of 6 would \ncorrespond to an effect that was as good as it could \npossibly be.\nFinally, in stage three, respondents were asked \nto \u2018spend\u2019 10 points to indicate the relative \nimportance of each of the areas mentioned in stage \none. Respondents were requested to spend more \npoints on areas that were the most important to \nthem.\nAs noted above, in addition to the PGI, the \nquestionnaire also contained the King\u2019s Health \nQuestionnaire and the EQ-5D. The King\u2019s Health \nQuestionnaire is a condition specific questionnaire \nthat aims to assess the impact of urinary \nincontinence on an individual\u2019s quality of life. It \ncontains questions set in nine domains relating \nto: general health perception, incontinence \nimpact, role limitations, physical limitations, social \nlimitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep \nand energy, and severity. With the exception of the \nfinal part of the questionnaire (severity measures) \nscores can be calculated for each domain (0\u2013100). \nThe higher the score the worse off an individual \nfeels they are and the lower they perceive their \nquality of life to be.\nThe EQ-5D is a standardised instrument used to \nmeasure quality of life. The EQ-5D is applicable to \na wide range of health conditions and treatments \nand it provides a simple descriptive profile and \na single index value for health status.98 The EQ-\n5D has five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual \nactivities, pain\/discomfort and anxiety\/depression) \nthat can be converted into a utility score.\nSample\nThe Bladder and Bowel Foundation (formerly \n\u2018InContact\u2019 and the \u2018Continence Foundation\u2019) \nis a national charity that provides information \nand support to people with bladder and bowel \nproblems, representing the interests of people \nwith continence problems with the aim of ensuring \nthey have access to the latest information and \nservices available.99 In 2006 a survey conducted by \nInContact was completed by 755 people affected \nby bladder and bowel problems.100 Of these, 188 \nwomen with SUI gave consent for future contact \nabout relevant research and formed the sample \nfor the current study. In July 2007 these women \nwere sent questionnaires for the current study \nby InContact. Given that this is a self-selected \nsample of women suffering from SUI and not a \nrandom sample of the population, it is not known \nhow representative this sample is of the wider \npopulation.\nEthical issues\nThe 2006 survey in which the participants were \noriginally identified was a service evaluation \nin which The Bladder and Bowel Foundation \nsurveyed people who had previously been in touch \nwith the charity. As such, no ethical approval was \nnecessary. The 2006 survey materials contained \nan explicit assurance that confidentiality would be \nmaintained and that identifiable data would not be \npassed on to third parties. Respondents were asked \nif they were willing to be contacted in the future for \nresearch purposes. For this study questionnaires \nwere sent in July 2007 to 188 women with SUI who \ngave their consent for further contact relating to \nresearch. The questionnaires were returned directly \nto the charity and, after screening only anonymous \ndata, were subsequently forwarded to the authors \nin accordance with the Medical Research Council\u2019s \nguidance on the use of personal information in \nmedical research and the Data Protection Act \n1998.101,102DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

These themes were: (1) \nactivities of daily living (work, home and social); \n(2) sex, hygiene and lifestyle issues; (3) emotional \nhealth; and (4) services. In total, 38 different areas \nwere reported by respondents. Activities of daily \nliving were the most frequently reported areas to \nbe affected by SUI, followed by sex, hygiene and \nlifestyle issues and emotional health.\nOut of 105 respondents, 73 respondents were \ncategorised as having answered the PGI correctly. \nA further nine respondents made mistakes in the \nPGI and 23 respondents did not fully complete \nit (Table 4). Of the 73 respondents who correctly \ncompleted the questionnaire, 61 answered the \nPGI with no mistakes (all sections were completed \nsatisfactorily). The remaining 12 respondents \nmade a small error in completion of the PGI. This \nsmall error always occurred in section three of the \nPGI, where respondents had to spend 10 points. \nThese respondents did in fact spend 10 points \nbut they missed out spending points in area 6 \n(all other areas of their life affected by SUI) and \ntotalled to 10 in box 6.

In addition, those who correctly \ncompleted the PGI appear to be better educated \nand in higher-income groups.\nIn addition to listing the outcomes of importance \nto women who suffer from SUI, a score of overall \nquality of life can also be calculated from the PGI. \nThe score ranges from 0 to 6, with 0 reflecting \na very low quality of life (\u2018it\u2019s as bad as it could \npossibly be\u2019) and 6 reflecting a very high quality \nof life (\u2018it\u2019s as high as it could possibly be\u2019).

For the \nrespondents who successfully completed the \nPGI the mean score was 2.4 (SD 1.4, range 0\u20136). \nGiven that a score of 6 on the PGI reflects the \nhighest quality of life, a mean score of 2.4 in this \npopulation reflects that their quality of life falls \nsignificantly short of their hopes and expectations. \nIn total, 101 out of 105 returned questionnaires \nhad a fully completed EQ-5D. Scores on the EQ-5D \nranged from \u20130.17 to 1. The mean EQ-5D score \nwas 0.598 (SD 0.339). Correlation between the \nmean PGI score and the mean EQ-5D score was, as \nexpected, positive and statistically significant.\nScores (out of 100) for each domain in the King\u2019s \nHealth Questionnaire can be seen in Table 7. The \nhigher the score, the worse off an individual feels. \nIn addition to the domains of the King\u2019s Health \nQuestionnaire, it also contains a section detailing \nthe respondent\u2019s bladder problems and how much \nthey affect the individual\u2019s life.\nCorrelations of the PGI and seven domains of the \nKing\u2019s Health Questionnaire were also performed. \nGiven the scoring system of the King\u2019s Health \nQuestionnaire we would expect to find a negative \ncorrelation between the PGI and King\u2019s Health \nQuestionnaire. All correlations were negative but \nonly two were statistically significant: personal \nrelationships (p = 0.004) and severity measures \n(p = 0.003).\nIn addition, correlations between the EQ-5D \nscore and the domains of the King\u2019s Health \nQuestionnaire were also calculated. We found all \nseven of the King\u2019s Health Questionnaire domains \nto be significantly (negatively) correlated with the \nEQ-5D. This result is to be expected, as many \nof the EQ-5D and King\u2019s Health Questionnaire \ndomains are similar.\nSummary\nThe PGI has been used to quantify the effect of \nSUI on the quality of women\u2019s lives for the first \ntime. In stage one of the PGI, 38 different areas of \na woman\u2019s life affected by SUI were reported. The \nmost frequently mentioned areas were: going out \nor socialising, with 14% of all respondents listing \nthis as one of the areas of their life affected by their \ncondition; personal hygiene (13%); and the effect \ntheir condition has on their sleep (11%). Shopping \n(8%), depression (8%), physical activity (6%), work \n(6%), anxiety (6%), travel (4%), household tasks \n(2%), personal (1%) and sexual relationships (2%) \nwere all also listed as areas of their life affected by \nSUI.\nThe respondents are a self-selected sample of \nwomen who had previously been in touch with a \npatient support charity and who may be considered \nto be active help-seekers. However, there is no \nreason to suspect that their experience of SUI \nand the relative perceived impact of SUI on \nvarious aspects of their lives are different from \nthe wider population of women affected. Nearly \n70% of respondents successfully completed the \nquestionnaire. A further 9% attempted the PGI \nbut made mistakes in its completion, and 22% \nfailed to fully complete the PGI (the majority of \nthese respondents completed stage one of the \nPGI but failed to complete stages two or three). \nThose respondents who successfully completed \nthe questionnaire were found to be younger, in \nTABLE 6  Example of Patient Generated Index scoring\nPart 1: list areas of life affected by \nurinary incontinence\nPart 2:  \nscore (0\u20136)\nPart 3: spend your  \n10 points Final PGI score\n1.

For the PGI to be used as a valid \nand reliable measure of outcomes of importance \nto women with SUI and to be able to accurately \nquantify the effect of SUI on their lives, the \nresponse rate and successful completion of the PGI \nwould need to be improved. Of the respondents, \n31% had difficulty in completing the questionnaire \nand there was also a low response rate to the survey \nin general (56%).\nIn order to improve this response rate and the \nchance of successful completion, alterations could \nbe made to the layout of the PGI to make it more \nuser-friendly. The PGI, or instruments like it, have \nbeen criticised in the past. Some authors question \nwhether they reflect the patient\u2019s view point or, \nconversely, whether they are simply reflecting \nthe views of the researchers who designed the \nquestionnaire.103 In this survey, while we did find a \nvaried response in the number of outcomes listed \nby respondents, the majority of these did in fact \ncome from the prompt list provided in the PGI. Of \nthe 10 most mentioned areas, eight of these were \nfrom the prompt list. Other studies have found \nsimilar associations between the prompt list and \nfinal outcomes listed by respondents. However, it is \nunclear whether this association is due to the most \nrelevant examples being selected from the prompt \nlist, or due to respondents being unwilling or \nunable to think of their own examples because the \nprompt list is already comprehensive.104\nWe correlated the mean PGI score with the mean \nEQ-5D scores. This correlation was, as expected, \nfound to be positive and statistically significant. \nIn addition to this, correlations between the \nKing\u2019s Health Questionnaire and the PGI were \nperformed. Although all correlations of the PGI \nand King\u2019s Health Questionnaire were as expected \n(negative), only two were found to be statistically \nsignificant. Given that the PGI outcomes and the \ndomains of the King\u2019s Health Questionnaire do \nnot correlate well, and that many of the aspects \nrespondents mentioned in the PGI list of outcomes \ndo not map very well on to the dimensions of the \nEQ-5D, this might suggest that generic measures, \nlike the EQ-5D, may not be a very good reflection \nof the preferences of people with incontinence. The \nPGI in this instance may therefore be capturing \nconcerns of women who suffer from SUI which are \nnot adequately captured by generic instruments, \nsuch as the EQ-5D. This is of particular interest in \nthe context of health technology appraisals such \nas this, where EQ-5D has become the accepted \nstandard for calculation of quality-adjusted life-\nyear (QALY) indices for use in determination of \ncost-effectiveness.105 As will be described in later \nchapters, health-state utilities derived from the \nEQ-5D have been used to estimate QALYs in \nthe economic evaluation. Hence, in the light of \nfindings reported in this chapter, evidence on \ncost-effectiveness of interventions needs careful \nconsideration.\nConclusion\nMuch of the available literature on SUI focuses \non doctor-selected clinical outcomes. Given the \nundoubted social and personal impact of SUI, \nthese outcomes may have limited relevance to the \nwomen who suffer this condition. Thirty-eight \ndifferent areas of an individual\u2019s life affected by \nSUI were identified by the PGI. The PGI succeeded \nin capturing a diverse range of outcomes of \nimportance to women suffering from SUI, although \nsome respondents found the PGI difficult to \ncomplete.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

This suggests that \ngeneric measures may not be a very good reflection \nof the preferences of people with incontinence.\nIdeally, the information obtained from this survey \nwould be used to help define outcome measures \nfor the systematic review of clinical effectiveness. \nHowever, these outcomes were often not considered \nin primary studies and hence their inclusion in a \nsystematic review was not possible. Nevertheless, \nit would be important to include them in future \nresearch in this area.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

This includes \nthe review methods (this chapter), characteristics \nof the included studies (Chapter 6), direct head-to-\nhead comparisons (Chapter 7), followed by MTC \nmodels (Chapter 8).\nInclusion and exclusion \ncriteria\nTypes of studies\nThe types of studies considered were RCTs and \nquasi-RCTs (alternate allocation). Trial data \nreported in conference abstracts, as well as full-text \npapers, were included. For abstracts, solely those \nidentified from the Cochrane Incontinence Group \nSpecialised Register of trials were used.\nTypes of participants\nThe participants were women with SUI or \nincontinence that was predominantly SUI (however \ndiagnosed). Classification of diagnoses was \naccepted as defined by the trialists.\nOwing to the small number of studies per \nintervention available, a pragmatic decision was \nmade to include studies where the majority (\u2265 50%) \nof the sample consisted of women with SUI or \npredominant SUI. Studies were therefore included \nif:\n\u2022  all women had SUI alone (type-1 population)\n\u2022  at least 50% of women had SUI alone; the \nremainder could have UUI or MUI (type-2 \npopulation)\n\u2022  under 50% of women had stress incontinence \nalone but the majority (50% or more) had MUI \nwith stress symptoms as a predominant pattern; \nthe remainder could have SUI, UUI or MUI \n(type-3 population).\nStudies were excluded if the proportion of women \nwith predominantly SUI was not reported, if the \ntype of incontinence (stress, urge, mixed) was \nunknown or undiagnosed, or if predominant \nsymptoms (stress or urgency) of women with MUI \nwere not specified.\nWomen with urinary incontinence whose symptoms \nmight be due to significant factors outside \nthe urinary tract were excluded, for example \nneurological disorders, cognitive impairment, and \nlack of independent mobility. Studies investigating \nnocturnal enuresis in women were also excluded.\nIncontinent women during pregnancy or in the \nearly postpartum period were considered for \ninclusion. Data from these childbearing women \nwere analysed separately on the assumption that \nthe effect of PFMT might differ in this group due \nto the physiological changes of pregnancy and \nin the postpartum period. Studies investigating \nprevention of incontinence among childbearing \nwomen were excluded.\nStudies that recruited mixed populations of \nmen and women with different types of urinary \nincontinence were eligible for inclusion, providing \nthat demographic and outcome data were reported \nseparately for women with predominantly SUI.\nTypes of interventions\nWe defined non-surgical treatment as that which \ncould be undertaken in a heath-care professional\u2019s \noffice or clinic and patients\u2019 homes. Any of the \nfollowing interventions, alone or in combination, \nwere included. Treatment definitions used were as \naccording to Cochrane Reviews where possible.\nLifestyle interventions\n\u2022  Weight loss, decreased physical exertion, fluid \nmanipulation, decreased caffeine, nicotine or \nalcohol consumption, treatment of constipation \nand dietary interventions.106\nPhysical or behavioural therapy\n\u2022  Pelvic floor muscle training, with or without \nbiofeedback \u2013 defined as \u2018a programme \nof repeated voluntary pelvic floor muscle \ncontractions taught and supervised by a \nhealth care professional\u2019.83 This includes \u2018The \nKnack\u2019, the use of a timed contraction of \nthe pelvic floor muscles before and during a \ncough (Miller 1998).107 However, it excludes \nPFMT introduced by a leaflet only, without \nany contact with a health-care professional \nChapter 5  \nMethods for reviewing clinical effectivenessMethods for reviewing clinical effectiveness\n32\n(which was classified as being equivalent to no \ntreatment).\n\u2022  Electrical stimulation (non-implanted) \u2013 local \nstimulation of pelvic floor muscles. Electrical \nnerve stimulation (e.g. sacral nerve) was \nexcluded.\n\u2022  Weighted vaginal cones.\n\u2022  Bladder training, either described by trialists as \nbladder training, bladder retraining, bladder \ndrill or bladder re-education or an intervention \n\u2018which included mandatory schedule or self \nschedule with the aim of increasing the interval \nbetween voids\u2019.53 Prompted or timed voiding \nor urge suppression techniques alone with \nno mention of mandatory schedule or self-\nschedule were not considered as BT.\nPharmacotherapy\n\u2022  SNRIs.\n\u2022  Local administration (in form of cream or \npessaries) of intravaginal low-dose estrogens, \ngiven as an adjunct to other therapy (e.g. \nPFMT) in postmenopausal women. Hormonal \ntreatment (estrogens) given on its own was \nexcluded.\nTrials comparing methods of delivering services \n(e.g. nurse-led care) were considered for inclusion \nif they involved one of the included interventions \nlisted above. The use of non-surgical therapies \nfor prevention of incontinence was excluded. \nComplementary therapies, such as acupuncture, \nhypnosis and herbal medicines, were also excluded.\nWhere studies reported a comparison involving \na programme of interventions (e.g. PFMT plus \nBT), then these studies were included, provided \nthat every participant in the intervention arm \nreceived all of the specified treatments. If, on the \nother hand, treatments were tailored according to \nparticipants\u2019 diagnosis (e.g. PFMT for participants \nwith stress incontinence alone and PFMT plus BT \nfor participants with mixed or urge incontinence) \nand some participants did not receive all \ncomponents available, studies were excluded, as it \nwas not possible to distinguish effects of individual \ntreatments for SUI.\nA valid comparator was one of the included \ninterventions or no treatment. Studies that \ncompared non-surgical with surgical interventions \nwere included in order to enable the performance \nof MTCs of non-surgical treatment. However, \nstudies were excluded if the comparator was an \nexcluded intervention (e.g. PFMT vs adrenergic \nagonists).\nTypes of outcome measures\nThe standardisation committee of the International \nContinence Society recommended that research \ninvestigating the effect of therapeutic interventions \nfor urinary incontinence in adult women \nshould incorporate outcome measurements in \nthe following five domains: (1) the patient\u2019s \nobservations (symptoms); (2) quantification of \nsymptoms (e.g. urine loss); (3) the clinician\u2019s \nobservations (anatomical or functional); (4) \nquality of life; and (5) socioeconomic measures.108 \nFollowing this recommendation, the following \nmeasures of outcomes were sought in this review:\nPrimary outcomes\n\u2022  Number of women cured.\n\u2022  Number of women cured or improved (this \noutcome is henceforth referred to in the text as \nimprovement).\n\u2022  Adverse events.\n\u2022  Condition-specific (and generic measures of \nhealth-related) quality of life.\nSecondary outcomes\n\u2022  Quantification of symptoms:\n  \u2013 number of incontinent episodes over \n24 hours\n  \u2013 number of pad changes over 24 hours\n  \u2013 mean volume or weight of urine loss on \npad test\n  \u2013 number of micturitions over 24 hours.\n\u2022  Participant satisfaction or desire for further \ntreatment.\n\u2022  Long-term data:\n  \u2013 number of women having incontinence \nsurgery\n  \u2013 return of symptoms\/recurrence.\n\u2022  Socioeconomic measures.\n\u2022  Other intermediate, explanatory or treatment-\nspecific outcomes:\n  \u2013 measure of pelvic floor muscle function\n  \u2013 treatment adherence\n  \u2013 volume and type of fluid intake or change \nin body mass index.\nThe cure and improvement rate may be ascertained \nvia women\u2019s observation (self-report), quantification \nof symptoms (typically based on incontinence \ndiaries or pad tests) or clinician\u2019s observation. \nThere was a considerable variability in the way \nthese outcomes were defined by the trialists, which \nlimited the possibilities for quantitative synthesis. \nWe therefore chose to combine data on the cure \nand improvement rate from different sources. The \nwomen\u2019s observation was given priority but for \nstudies in which it was not reported, the rate based DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Where diary data \nwere also not reported, the rate based on pad tests \nor any other definitions chosen by the trialists was \nused.\nThe choice of quality of life measures again varied \nacross studies. In addition, scores were reported \neither as final values or changes from baseline. \nFinal values were preferred, but where these were \nnot reported, a change score was used. Quantitative \nsynthesis was performed separately for final values \nand change scores.\nSearch methods for \nidentification of studies\nLiterature searching was performed in two stages. \nFirst, relevant trials were identified from the \nCochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register \nof controlled trials of interventions for urinary \nincontinence (last searched 20 March 2008). \nWhen last searched for this project, the Register \ncontained trials identified from: MEDLINE \n(covering January 1966 to week 4 of January 2008), \nthe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials \n(CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2008), CINAHL (covering \nJanuary 1982 to December 2000), and from \nhand searching relevant journals and conference \nproceedings.\nSecond, an extensive electronic search was carried \nout to identify reports of relevant published \nand ongoing studies, as well as grey literature \nand recent meeting abstracts from sources that \nare not currently covered for the Cochrane \nIncontinence Group Specialised Register of trials. \nA highly sensitive search strategy based upon the \none developed for the Cochrane Incontinence \nReview Group was adopted.109 This strategy used \ncontrolled vocabulary and text word terms that \nreflected the clinical condition, interventional \nprocedures and study designs that were considered \nwithin the scope of this project. The following \nadditional databases were searched:\n\u2022  CINAHL (January 1982 to week 1 of December \n2007)\n\u2022  EMBASE (January 1980 to week 49 2007)\n\u2022  BIOSIS (January 1985 to 13 March 2008)\n\u2022  Science Citation Index and Social Science \nCitation Index (1970 to 2 February 2008)\n\u2022  Current Controlled Trials (searched on 29 May \n2008)\n\u2022  ClinicalTrials.gov (searched on 9 June 2008)\n\u2022  UKCRN Portfolio Database (replaces UK \nNational Research Register).\nAn Internet search included the websites of relevant \nprofessional organisations and manufacturers that \nhad not been covered by the Specialised Register \nor the other bibliographic database searches. No \nlanguage or date restrictions were applied to the \nsearches.\nSearches were run for the intervention areas listed \nabove on each of the databases listed. The main \nsearches were run during September to November \n2007, with updates in December 2007\/January\u2013\nFebruary 2008. A set of urinary incontinence terms \nwas combined with a set of terms to cover the \nmain interventions listed above. These terms were \ncombined with a study design filter as appropriate \nfor each database. InterTasc website design filters \nwere assessed and adapted if suitable.110 Full \ndetails of the search strategies used are provided in \nAppendix 2.\nData collection and analysis\nSelection of studies\nThe titles and abstracts identified by the searches \nwere assessed by one reviewer, having already been \nassessed by the Cochrane Incontinence Group \nTrials Search Co-ordinator. Full-text copies of all \npotentially relevant reports were obtained and \nindependently assessed by two reviewers, using \na form developed to determine whether the \nreports met the inclusion criteria (Appendix 3). \nAny disagreements were resolved by consensus or \narbitration by a third person.\nData extraction\nA data extraction form was developed to record \ndetails of study design, methods, participants, \ninterventions and outcomes (Appendix 4). One \nreviewer extracted data and another reviewer \nchecked the extracted data. Any disagreements that \ncould not be resolved by discussion were referred to \nan arbiter.\nFor studies in which the majority of participants \nhad stress incontinence alone (types 1 and 2 \nabove), data were extracted for both primary and \nsecondary outcomes. For studies where stress-\npredominant MUI was the majority (type 3) and \nstudies of childbearing women, data were extracted \nfor primary outcomes only. General background Methods for reviewing clinical effectiveness\n34\nand methodological information was collected from \nall studies.\nAssessment of risk of bias in \nincluded studies\nTwo reviewers independently assessed all of the \nstudies that met selection criteria for potential \nrisk of bias. The assessment used the adapted \nversion of a checklist developed by the Cochrane \nIncontinence Group (Appendix 5).109\nData synthesis\nData analysis was performed in two stages: (1) \npairwise (head-to-head) comparison (Chapter 7), \nand (2) a mixed-treatments comparison (Chapter \n8).\nPairwise comparisons\nFor trials with multiple publications, only the most \nup-to-date or complete data for each outcome \nwere included. Overall, there was inconsistency in \noutcome measures chosen by the trialists. For this \nreason, quantitative synthesis was performed on \nprimary outcomes only. A random effects model \nwas used to derive summary estimates with 95% CI \nof odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous variables (cure \nand improvement rates) and standardised mean \ndifference (SMD) for continuous variables (quality-\nof-life measures). The random effects model was \nchosen because of variability in the characteristics \nof included studies in terms of participants\u2019 \ndiagnoses (inclusion of women with stress, urge or \nmixed incontinence), variation in the treatment \nprogrammes, and the frequency and duration of \ntreatment. Odds ratios were used because of their \nsymmetry compared with relative risks and were \ntherefore unaffected by outcome definitions (e.g. \nnumber of women cured or not cured). Odds ratios \nwere also chosen to fulfil a requirement of the MTC \nmodel.\nPublication bias was not formally assessed in the \nanalysis, as the number of studies available for \neach comparison was very limited. Heterogeneity \nbetween studies was assessed by visual inspection \nof plots of the data, the chi-squared test for \nheterogeneity and the I2 statistic.111 Possible \nreasons for heterogeneity were explored, such \nas differences in the populations studied, the \ntreatment given or the way in which the outcomes \nwere assessed. Studies were grouped and sorted \nby types of participants: studies solely comprising \nwomen with SUI alone (type 1), studies where the \nmajority of participants (50% or more) had stress \nincontinence alone (type 2) and studies where the \nmajority (50% or more) of participants had MUI \nwith stress as the predominant pattern (type 3). \nWhere a quantitative synthesis was considered to \nbe inappropriate or not feasible, then a narrative \nsynthesis of the results was provided. Analysis was \nperformed in stata.112\nThe duration of treatment varied between \nstudies. No attempt was made to standardise \nthe treatment duration. Data at the end of the \nprescribed treatment phase, or at the first outcome \nassessment, if later, were used in quantitative \nsynthesis. This may mean that any treatment \neffects shown were measured when they may be \nconsidered to be showing the maximum effects. \nData from further follow-ups after the end of the \ninitial treatment phase are reported in the text but \nare not included in the meta-analysis.\nData from primary studies were often reported \nambiguously, particularly the number of people \ncontributing data for an outcome (i.e. there were \nproblems caused by missing data). For example, \nsome studies had reported percentages without \nreference to an actual number of participants, or \nwhere studies claimed to have used an \u2018intention-\nto-treat\u2019 method but this was not clearly described. \nWhere possible, we used the number of participants \nwith available outcome data as the denominator \nfor the relevant time point (i.e. we did not make \nthe assumption that all participants who dropped \nout \u2018failed\u2019 and were not cured). We did consider \nthe reasons for missing data caused by withdrawal\/\ndropout reported by the trialists and these are \nhighlighted (Chapter 7) where these appear to be \ntreatment related. This is particularly problematic \nwhere there is differential withdrawal between trial \narms.\nFurther analysis was planned on the following \npatient subgroups:\n\u2022  nature of presentation \u2013 postpartum (within \n12 months of childbirth) versus at any other \ntime\n\u2022  nature of the incontinence \u2013 stress urinary \nincontinence alone versus mixed\/any urinary \nincontinence\n\u2022  presence or absence of a co-existing anterior \nvaginal wall prolapse.\nIn the event this was not performed due to a lack of \navailable data.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

With direct, head-\nto-head, comparisons alone it is often not clear \nwhich treatment is the most effective.113 Multiple \ntreatment comparison models attempt to address \nthis problem by analysing all of the treatments and \nall of the trials together in one single model. In \nsuch a model it is possible to estimate the OR of \nall pairs of treatments, using direct and indirect \nevidence.\nMultiple treatment comparison models were used \nfor key treatments and outcomes (i.e. cure and \nimprovement rates). The models were evaluated \nusing Bayesian methods within winbugs software.114 \nA full description is given in Chapter 8.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

These results were then assessed for \npotential relevance to the project and to remove \nduplicates already present in the Specialised \nRegister that could not be removed by reference \nmanager duplicate checking. As described above, \nthe numbers retrieved for CINAHL, EMBASE, \nBIOSIS and Science Citation Index include only \nthe additional reports identified after excluding \nthose identified in the Cochrane Incontinence \nRegister. A total of 7103 titles and abstracts were \nidentified, of which 378 were selected for full \nassessment.\nNumber and type of studies \nincluded\nOf the papers selected for full text assessment \nthe level of agreement between reviewers about \nwhether a paper met the inclusion criteria was \nvery high, and 176 papers from the search met the \ninclusion criteria for the review. These described 88 \nstudies, which covered 37 distinct treatments (Table \n9) and 68 treatment comparisons (Table 10). The \nlist of included studies and associated references \nare listed in Appendix 6.\nExcluded studies, with reasons \nfor specific exclusions\nA total of 199 papers were obtained but did not \nmeet the inclusion criteria (Figure 7). Of these, \n113 were excluded on the basis of study design, \npopulations, interventions or outcomes. A further \n86 papers (describing 56 studies) that did include \nrelevant populations or interventions as part of \nthe study were retained for further assessment \nand subsequently excluded through the consensus \nwithin the research team that it was impossible \nto attribute an effect to a particular intervention \nfor women with SUI.

For example, some studies \nwould state \u2018double blind\u2019 but would not detail \nwhether this referred to participants, health-care \nproviders or outcome assessors. In addition, for \nsome treatments (e.g. PFMT) it was not considered \nfeasible to blind the health-care providers or \nparticipants to group allocation.\nNevertheless, 19 studies (21.6%) reported \nparticipant blinding.57,117,128,130\u2013134,136\u2013145,189 Twelve \nof these involved drug therapy and used a placebo \nto blind participants.57,117,136\u2013145 In the other seven \nstudies, participants were blinded through sham \nES,130\u2013134,189 or imitation or placebo PFMT.57,128 Six \nstudies (6.8%) reported that health-care providers \nwere blinded.57,133,140,144,183,189 However, in one of \nthese, which was a four-arm trial comparing drug \ntherapy with active or imitation PFMT versus \nPFMT with active or placebo drug,57 blinding \nChapter 6  \nDescription of studiesDescription of studies\n38\nTABLE 8  Search results \u2013 numbers of hits retrieved\nDatabase Number of hits\nNumber of full \ntext papers \nselected for \nassessment\nNumber of \nreports included \nin final review\nPublished reports\nCochrane SR 645 (date of last search: 20 March 2008) 322 175\nCINAHL 1115 (date of last search: 5 February 2008) 4 0\nEMBASE  1031 (date of last search: 10 December 2007) 23 0\nBIOSIS 204 (date of last search: 13 March 2008) 9 3a\nSCI, SSCI 3228 (date of last search: 6 February 2008) 5 1b\nEli Lilly website 15 (date of last search: 29 May 2008) 15 0\nSubtotal 6238 378 179\nOngoing trial list\nUKCRN Portfolio \nDatabasec\n34 (date of last search: 9 June 2008) NA NA\nCCT 549 (date of last search: 29 May 2008) NA NA\nClinicalTrials 282 (date of last search: 9 June 2008) NA NA\nSubtotal 865\nTotal 7013 378 179\nCCT, Current Controlled Trials; Cochrane SR, Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of trials; NA, not \napplicable; SCI, Science Citation Index; SSCI, Social Science Citation Index.\na  EAU conference abstracts \u2013 12 reports of this trial had already been identified in the SR (B\u00f8 and colleagues, 1990)115 \nand full text reports of these trials had already been identified in the SR.116,117\nb  This was a new trial but also picked up by SR MEDLINE search shortly after \u2013 related to timing of searches.118\nc  Replaces National Research Register.\nwas only possible for the drug treatment aspect \nof the study and not for PFMT.

A large proportion of the participants \n(n = 4197) came from 11 pharmaceutical \ntrials comparing SNRI with placebo. Trials of \nphysical or behavioural interventions for non-\nchildbearing women were generally small; only \nfour trials57,123,129,183 had 200 or more participants \nand this included one trial57 comparing PFMT \nwith SNRI. Participants\u2019 baseline characteristics \nare provided in Appendix 10. A brief summary \nof the baseline characteristics of the participants \nin the included studies, such as mean age, is \nalso provided in Chapter 7, although it was not \npossible to summarise severity of incontinence \nof the participants in the included studies in any \nmeaningful way because this was reported using \ndiverse measures.\nThe main characteristics of active treatments are \nsummarised in Appendices 11\u201315. The majority \nof included studies involved PFMT as part of their \ninterventions. The PFMT programme that was \nused varied in a number of ways: for example, \nwhether a correct pelvic floor muscle contraction \nwas confirmed prior to training, the frequency and \ntype (e.g. strength and endurance) of contractions \nperformed per day, the duration of training, the \nnumber of clinic sessions provided and whether \ntraining was provided individually or in groups. \nAdvice on lifestyle change or strategies for \nsymptoms of urge and\/or frequency may also be \ngiven. However, without any structured regimen, \nsuch advice was considered as part of a broad \nPFMT programme and not a separate treatment.\nBiofeedback may also be provided for the purpose \nof teaching a voluntary pelvic muscle floor \ncontraction. A single episode of BF in the initial \nteaching but not thereafter was similarly considered \nas part of a broad PFMT programme. This \nexcludes BF that was used repeatedly to monitor or \nassist PFMT, which was classified separately as an \nadjunct treatment (PFMT with BF). An intravaginal \ndevice is also included in the BF comparison.\nWhile it is likely that the success or otherwise of \nPFMT may be contingent on the level of intensity \nof the training programme, characterising \nor categorising PFMT is difficult. We chose \nsupervisory intensity (the frequency of clinic \nvisits or any face-to-face contacts with health-care \nprofessionals) as a crude measure of differentiating \nPFMT programmes. The current guidelines43 of \nthe National Institute for Health and Clinical \nExcellence (NICE) estimated from the Guidance \nDevelopment Group members that four to eight \nsessions were typically offered for PFMT over \n3 months (six visits over 3 months or two visits \nper month).

This is regardless of the amount or \ntype of pelvic floor muscle contractions performed \nper day or the duration and precise nature of \nsupervision; such data were poorly reported and \nhence could not be incorporated into our analysis.\nThe comparison group may be another active \ntreatment or no treatment. No treatment in \nthis review is equivalent to no active treatment. \nLeaflet-only PFMT, which was not taught by a \nhealth-care professional, is also considered as \n\u2018no treatment\u2019, based on the assumption that \nthe distribution of guidelines has a small effect \non behaviour200 and also that patients are not \nnaive and can obtain knowledge of PFMT from \nanywhere (e.g. internet).

A common problem associated \nwith ES is that there is no consistency in the \ncriteria used to describe ES.201 Treatment could \nbe described on the basis of the type of current \nbeing used (e.g. faradic stimulation, interferential \ntherapy), the structure being targeted (e.g. \nneuromuscular ES), or the current intensity, etc. \nNo attempt was made in this review to categorise \ndifferent treatment protocols.\nThe VCs treatment was relatively homogeneous \nand so was SNRI drug therapy, which was based \non duloxetine. Nevertheless, one study by \nKinchen and colleagues140 was a \u2018naturalistic\u2019 \nstudy, for which participants could, at any point \nafter randomisation, choose to remain on SNRI \nas randomised, reduce drug doses, add other \ntreatments to SNRI, or suspend SNRI and receive \nother treatments.

Results \nare grouped into three sections: comparison with \nno treatment and variation within comparators, \ncomparison between different treatments (single \nmodality), and comparison between different \ntreatments (dual modality).\nA summary of the baseline characteristics of the \nparticipants and interventions in the included \nstudies is provided at the beginning of each \nsection. This is described in more detail in \nAppendix 10.\nThe focus is on the primary outcome data (cure, \nimprovement, adverse events and quality of life) \nand, in particular, those that are relevant to the \nMTC analysis in the following chapter (Chapter \n7). There was a great variability in the way cure \nand improvement was defined by the trialists. This \nis detailed in Appendix 16. As noted in Chapter \n5 (see Types of outcome measures), we chose to \nsubstitute woman\u2019s observation (measurement \ntype 1) with quantified symptoms or clinician\u2019s \nobservation (measurement type 2), if the former \nwas missing. The type of outcome measurement for \neach study is shown on the right hand side of the \nquantitative synthesis figure (measurement type \u2013 \nsee Box 8). For quantitative synthesis, data at the \nend of the prescribed treatment phase, or at the \nfirst outcome assessment, if later, were used. Data \nfrom further follow-ups and other relevant primary \noutcome data are reported in the text and also in \nAppendix 17.\nStudies with different population types are analysed \ntogether. The type of population included in each \ntrial is also shown on the right hand side of the \nfigure (population type \u2013 Box 8). The quantitative \nanalysis for cure and improvement rates was also \nperformed with studies that included women \ndiagnosed as having SUI only (population type \n1); the results are presented in Appendix 18. \nQuantitative data syntheses for condition-specific \nquality of life were limited due to lack of available \ndata; these are given in Appendix 19. Studies of \nchildbearing women were analysed separately and \nprovided in Appendix 20. Secondary outcome \ndata of all relevant comparisons are reported in \nAppendix 21.\nChapter 7  \nAssessment of clinical effectiveness\nType of outcome measurement\n1.  Women\u2019s observation\n2.

The only relevant study119 was \na crossover trial evaluating the effect of increasing \nor decreasing fluid intake on urinary symptoms in \nwomen (Table 13). Women were randomised in the \norder in which they increased or decreased fluids. \nAll women were instructed to restrict caffeine. No \ninformation was available on any of the specified \noutcomes.\nPFMT with and without BF\nPFMT, with or without BF, vs no \ntreatment\nThe characteristics of included studies comparing \nPFMT (with and without BF) and no treatment \nare summarised in Table 14. Fourteen studies were \neligible for this comparison, in which a total of \n958 participants were randomised. Studies varied \nwidely in terms of the duration of treatment \nprescribed by the trialists, as well as supervisory \nintensity (measured in terms of the number of \nclinic visits or any face-to-face contacts with a \nhealth-care professional). No studies reported data \non further follow-up after the end of the prescribed Assessment of clinical effectiveness\n46\nTABLE 13  Baseline characteristics of randomised controlled trials comparing lifestyle changes to no treatment\nStudy ID\nPopulation \ntype\nDuration \n(month) Comparator\nN \nrandomised\nAge \n(years)\nSupervisory \nintensitya\nSwithinbank \n2005119\n2 2 Increase fluid 84  \n(crossover trial)\n54.8 Intensive\nDecrease fluid 84  \n(crossover trial)\nIntensive\na  Intensive, more than two clinic visits per month.\ntreatment phase.

Where both \nPFMT and PFMT plus sham ES were present in \na trial,121 the dichotomous data were combined \n(added up).\nCure and improvement rate\nFigures 8 and 9 show the number of women who \nwere either cured or improved, respectively, in \nthe PFMT group (with or without BF) versus the \nno-treatment group at the end of the prescribed \ntreatment phase. Pooled data for cure rates showed \nhigher cure rates for PFMT with or without BF, but \nwith significant heterogeneity (Figure 8: PFMT vs \nno treatment \u2013 23% vs 7%, OR 5.41, 95% CI 1.64 \nto 17.82; PFMT with BF vs no treatment \u2013 42% \nvs 2%, OR 21.54, 95% CI 3.65 to 126.98). The \nsource of the heterogeneity appeared to be the \ninclusion of studies with women with SUI with or \nwithout UUI symptoms (population types 2 or 3). \nIn these studies the direction and magnitude of \neffect varied across studies. Of note is that the two \nstudies reporting the lowest effect size123,129 not only \nincluded women with different types of urinary \nincontinence, but also had the largest sample size, \nless intensive supervision (fewer clinic visits) and \nrelatively substantial provision of care for the no-\ntreatment group (e.g. self-administered behavioural \ntraining, clinic visits), which may have contributed \nto the relatively small effect size.\nRemoving these studies reduced the statistical \nheterogeneity but also widened the CI (as fewer \ndata were available for meta-analysis) (Appendix \n18, Comparison 01: PFMT vs no treatment \u2013 39% \nvs 3%, OR 15.15, 95% CI 5.50 to 41.75; PFMT with \nBF vs no treatment \u2013 80% vs 0%, OR 77.00, 95% CI \n3.75 to 1581.71).\nResults for improvement rates similarly favoured \nPFMT with or without BF compared with no \ntreatment, though statistical heterogeneity was \nagain evident across studies (Figure 9: no BF, OR \n11.75, 95% CI 3.49 to 39.55; with BF, OR 24.20, \n95% CI 2.02 to 290.58). One additional cause of \nheterogeneity for this outcome was the greater \nvariability in the way \u2018improvement\u2019 was defined \nbetween studies, as the heterogeneity remained \neven after removing studies with mixed diagnoses \n(Appendix 18, Comparison 02: OR 27.07, 95 \nCI 4.72 to 155.35). Crucially, the smallest effects \nwere found in those studies with placebo or \nimitation PFMT57,128 in the no-treatment arm \nand with women with mixed types of urinary \nincontinence.123,129\nAdverse events\nAdverse events were uncommon in the PFMT \ngroup (Table 15). Nevertheless, two studies127,129 \nreported that up to 12% of women experienced \nadverse events during PFMT.\nQuality of life\nCondition-specific quality of life was reported using \nvarious measures, including the Social Activity \nIndex, the Urinary Incontinence Quality of Life \n(I-QoL) scale, the Leicester Impact Scale, the \nIncontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ) and the \nBristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms \n(B-FLUTS) (Appendix 19, Comparison 01). In all \nbut two trials,123,129 results were better for the PFMT \ngroup (with or without BF). One study115 reported \nthis outcome using two instruments (Social Activity \nIndex and B-FLUTS), with results consistently \nfavouring PFMT. As the outcome measures varied \nbetween studies and not all studies reported data \namenable to meta-analysis, quantitative synthesis \nwas not performed.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

There was \nalso a potential difference in supervisory intensity \nin a further study by Pages and colleagues,154 in \nwhich the PFMT group had group therapy for \n60 minutes, five times a week, whereas the BF \ngroup had individual therapy for 15 minutes, five \ntimes a week.\nIn addition to devices specifically designed \nto provide visual and\/or audio BF, the use of \nintravaginal resistance device,149 an endotrainer151 \nand an exerciser155 were also classified as BF for the \npurpose of this review.\nCure and improvement rate\nPooled data showed that at the end of the \nprescribed treatment phase the addition of BF to \nPFMT resulted in significantly higher cure and \nimprovements than with PFMT alone (Figures \n10 and 11: cure rates 34% vs 49%, OR 0.48, \n95% CI 0.30 to 0.77; improvement rates 76% vs \n86%, OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.97). Among the \nstudies showing the largest effect size were studies \nby Glavind and colleagues150 and Wilson and \ncolleagues,157 which had additional supervisory \nvisits in the BF group relative to the PFMT \ngroup. The study by Pages and colleagues,154 \nwhich was also a trial with a potential difference \nin supervisory intensity, also suggested a large \ntreatment effect in the cure data.\nTwo studies150,157 conducted a further follow-up \nafter the end of the supervised treatment in which \nall women were advised to continue PFMT at home \nwithout BF or any close supervision by a health-\ncare professional. The first study157 with 6-month \nfollow-up (4.5 months after the end of 6-week \ntreatment) reported that women who did not use \nBF in the treatment phase were significantly less \nlikely to improve than those who trained with BF \n(Appendix 17, Comparison 02, 4\/15 vs 9\/14, OR \n0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.98). In the second study150 \nwith 2.5 years of follow-up, the results for cure and \nimprovement also favoured the BF group, although \nthe differences were not statistically significant \n(Appendix 17, Comparison 02, cure 0\/14 vs 5\/19, \nOR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.80; improvement 4\/14 \nvs 8\/19, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.40).\nAdverse events\nAdverse events were uncommon but in two \nstudies146,153 that did report incidents, more \nparticipants (15\u201327%) experienced adverse events \nif they were using BF. Some women found the \ndevice unpleasant or painful (Table 17).\nQuality of life\nFive studies120,147,152,153,158 reported condition-specific \nquality of life using four different measures (Table \n17). In four of these studies results were similar \nfor both groups, but in one study,158 women \nreported statistically significantly better quality \nof life in the PFMT group than with those using \nBF. Quantitative synthesis did not demonstrate \na statistically significant difference between the \ngroups (Appendix 19, Comparison 01, SMD for \ntotal score, \u20130.29, 95% CI \u20130.62 to 0.03; SMD for \nchange in score, 0.49, 95% CI \u20130.14 to 1.12).\nPFMT vs PFMT with additional sessions\nThe characteristics of included studies comparing \nPFMT with and without additional supervisory \nclinical sessions are summarised in Table 18.\nCure and improvement rate\nCure and improvement rates were consistently \nhigher for women who received additional \nsupervisory sessions (Figures 12 and 13: cure \nrate, 15% vs 43%, OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.43; DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Within the \ndata available from the six studies that reported at \nleast one of the specified primary outcomes,164\u2013169 \nthere was insufficient evidence to suggest that any \nof these variants of PFMT were more effective than \nthe comparator treatment shown in Table 20.\nOther physical and behavioural \ninterventions\nThe characteristics of included studies comparing \nphysical or behavioural interventions other than \nPFMT (with and without BF) are summarised in \nTable 21.\nElectrical stimulation vs no treatment\nEight studies115,124,126,130\u2013134 compared ES with no \nactive treatment. Five studies provided treatment \nby means of a device for home use, and compared \nit with either sham treatment130,131,133,134 or no \ntreatment.115 The other studies provided treatment \nat clinic, compared with sham treatment126,132 or no \ntreatment.124\nCure and improvement rate\nPooled data showed no statistically significant \ndifference between the groups in the cure rate \n(6% vs 6%, OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.94), but ES \nshowed a significantly higher rate for improvement \n(37% vs 13%, OR 3.93, 95% CI 1.43 to 10.80) \ncompared with no active treatment, although there \nwas some evidence of heterogeneity (Figures 14 \nand 15). The source of heterogeneity is unclear \nbut it appears to be caused by the study by B\u00f8 \nand colleagues.115 Removal of this study reduced \nstatistical heterogeneity and the difference between \nthe groups was still statistically significant (OR \n2.46, 95% CI 1.14 to 5.30, figure not shown).\nAdverse events\nOnly two studies115,134 reported any incidence of \nadverse events (Table 22). All recorded cases were \nattributed to the treatment device, whether it was \nused for active or sham ES. In the study by B\u00f8 and \ncolleagues,115 seven of the 32 participants in the ES \ngroup stopped treatment due to adverse events.\nQuality of life\nTwo studies115,131 reported condition-specific \nquality of life, with one of these studies131 using \ntwo instruments (questionnaires). Results were \ninconsistent across and within studies (Table 22 and \nAppendix 19, Comparison 03).\nThere were no statistically significant differences in \ngeneral HRQoL scores (SF-36) between the groups \nin two studies (Appendix 17, Comparison 10).131,134\nComparison of different variants of ES\nTwo studies157,172 assessed different variants of ESs. \nOne of these studies157 compared faradism and \ninterferential therapy (IFT), both as an adjunct \ntreatment to PFMT with clinic-based BF, for a \nperiod of 6 weeks. After this initial supervised \ntreatment phase, all participants (N = 30) \ncontinued with PFMT and were followed up for \n6 months.Assessment of clinical effectiveness\n56\nS\nt\nu\nd\ny\nO\nR\n \n(\n9\n5\n%\n \nC\nI\n)\nE\nv\ne\nn\nt\ns\n,\n \nt\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\nE\nv\ne\nn\nt\ns\n,\n \nc\no\nn\nt\nr\no\nl\n%\nW\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\nM\ne\na\ns\nu\nr\ne\nP\no\np\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nt\ny\np\ne\nB\n\u00f8\n1\n9\n9\n0\n1\n5\n9\n0\n.\n1\n5\n(\n0\n.\n0\n1\nt\no\n3\n.\n1\n9\n)\n0\n\/\n2\n9\n \n2\n\/\n2\n3\n \n1\n8\n.\n5\n0\n1\n1\nK\no\nn\ns\nt\na\nn\nt\ni\nn\ni\nd\no\nu\n2\n0\n0\n7\n1\n1\n6\n0\n.\n0\n9\n(\n0\n.\n0\n0\nt\no\n1\n.\n9\n0\n)\n7\n\/\n1\n0\n1\n2\n\/\n1\n2\n \n1\n8\n.\n3\n6\n2\n1\nZ\na\nn\ne\nt\nt\ni\n2\n0\n0\n7\n1\n6\n1\n0\n.\n1\n1\n(\n0\n.\n0\n2\nt\no\n0\n.\n6\n1\n)\n2\n\/\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\/\n2\n3\n \n6\n3\n.\n1\n4\n2\n1\nO\nv\ne\nr\na\nl\nl\n(\nI\n2\n=\n0\n.\n0\n%\n,\n \np\n \n=\n0\n.\n9\n7\n2\n)\n0\n.\n1\n1\n(\n0\n.\n0\n3\nt\no\n0\n.\n4\n3\n)\n9\n\/\n6\n0\n2\n5\n\/\n5\n8\n1\n0\n0\n.\n0\n0\nN\nO\nT\nE\n:\nW\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\ns\na\nr\ne\nf\nr\no\nm\nr\na\nn\nd\no\nm\ne\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ns\na\nn\na\nl\ny\ns\ni\ns\n1\n0\n.\n0\n0\n3\n8\n7\n1\n2\n5\n9\nF\na\nv\no\nu\nr\ns\n \nP\nF\nM\nT\n \na\nd\nd\nF\na\nv\no\nu\nr\ns\n \nP\nF\nM\nT\nS\nt\nu\nd\ny\nO\nR\n \n(\n9\n5\n%\n \nC\nI\n)\nE\nv\ne\nn\nt\ns\n,\n \nt\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\nE\nv\ne\nn\nt\ns\n,\n \nc\no\nn\nt\nr\no\nl\n%\nW\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\nM\ne\na\ns\nu\nr\ne\nP\no\np\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nt\ny\np\ne\nB\n\u00f8\n1\n9\n9\n0\n1\n5\n9\n0\n.\n0\n9\n(\n0\n.\n0\n1\nt\no\n0\n.\n7\n4\n)\n1\n9\n\/\n2\n9\n2\n2\n\/\n2\n3\n6\n7\n.\n5\n7\n1\n1\nK\no\nn\ns\nt\na\nn\nt\ni\nn\ni\nd\no\nu\n2\n0\n0\n7\n1\n1\n6\n0\n.\n0\n1\n(\n0\n.\n0\n0\nt\no\n0\n.\n2\n8\n)\n2\n\/\n1\n0\n1\n2\n\/\n1\n2\n3\n2\n.\n4\n3\n1\n1\nO\nv\ne\nr\na\nl\nl\n(\nI\n2\n=\n4\n.\n7\n%\n,\n \np\n \n=\n0\n.\n3\n0\n6\n)\n0\n.\n0\n5\n(\n0\n.\n0\n1\nt\no\n0\n.\n2\n8\n)\n2\n1\n\/\n3\n9\n3\n4\n\/\n3\n5\n1\n0\n0\n.\n0\n0\nN\nO\nT\nE\n:\nW\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\ns\na\nr\ne\nf\nr\no\nm\nr\na\nn\nd\no\nm\ne\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ns\na\nn\na\nl\ny\ns\ni\ns\nF\na\nv\no\nu\nr\ns\n \nP\nF\nM\nT\n \na\nd\nd\nF\na\nv\no\nu\nr\ns\n \nP\nF\nM\nT\n1\n0\n.\n0\n0\n0\n5\n1\n2\n0\n0\n1\nF\nI\nG\nU\nR\nE\n \n1\n2\n \nC\nu\nr\ne\n \nr\na\nt\ne\ns\n:\n \np\ne\nl\nv\ni\nc\n \nfl\no\no\nr\n \nm\nu\ns\nc\nl\ne\n \nt\nr\na\ni\nn\ni\nn\ng\n \n(\nP\nF\nM\nT\n)\n \nv\ne\nr\ns\nu\ns\n \nP\nF\nM\nT\n \nw\ni\nt\nh\n \na\nd\nd\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \ns\ne\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\ns\n.\nF\nI\nG\nU\nR\nE\n \n1\n3\n \nI\nm\np\nr\no\nv\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \nr\na\nt\ne\ns\n:\n \np\ne\nl\nv\ni\nc\n \nfl\no\no\nr\n \nm\nu\ns\nc\nl\ne\n \nt\nr\na\ni\nn\ni\nn\ng\n \n(\nP\nF\nM\nT\n)\n \nv\ne\nr\ns\nu\ns\n \nP\nF\nM\nT\n \nw\ni\nt\nh\n \na\nd\nd\ni\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \ns\ne\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\ns\n.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Participants \n(N = 49) received these treatments with supervision \nfor 6 months and were then instructed to perform \nPFMT with BF for a further 6 months.\nResults showed that improvement was more likely \nfor faradism and clinic-based maximal stimulation \nthan for interferential therapy and home-based \nlow-intensity stimulation, respectively, both after \nthe supervised treatment phase and at 6 months \nafter the end of the supervised phase (Appendix \n17, Comparisons 11\u201312). However, CIs were \nwide and did not rule out clinically important \ndifferences that could favour either treatment. No \ninformation was available on cure, adverse events \nor quality of life.\nVCs vs no treatment\nCure and improvement rate\nTwo studies115,129 comparing VCs with no treatment \nreported conflicting data on improvement (Figure \n16). This may stem from a range of factors such \nas difference in study populations (SUI with or \nwithout UUI symptoms) and sample size, duration \nof treatment and supervisory intensity.

Another four-arm \ntrial by Castro-Diaz and colleagues138 varied a \nstarting dose in the first 2 weeks (20 mg twice a \nday, 40 mg once a day or 40 mg twice a day), with \nall participants in the SNRI group taking 40 mg \ntwice daily in the subsequent weeks. In this study, \ncure and improvement rates and quality of life \nwere measured at the end of 8 weeks, whereas \nadverse events were reported at the end of \n4 weeks when all participants had at least 2 weeks \nof ingesting 40 mg twice a day. In the study by \nKinchen and colleagues,140 the participants were \nallowed to reduce or suspend study drug or \nuse other modalities of treatment (e.g. PFMT) \nsimultaneously with SNRI. One study by Manning \nand colleagues142 did not specify dosage and this \nwas assumed to be 80 mg per day.\nCure and improvement rate\nCure and improvement rates were consistently \nhigher across studies for SNRI than with placebo, \nregardless of the dosage (80, 40 or 20 mg per day) \n(Figures 17 and 18). Pooled data for a daily dosage \nof 80 mg showed that cure was reported in 11% \n(67\/609) of the participants using SNRI compared \nwith 8% (53\/683) for placebo, and improvement \nwas reported in 65% (1254\/1939) for SNRI \ncompared with 46% (803\/1733) for placebo. The \ndifference between the groups in improvement \nreached statistical significance (Figure 18: OR 2.02, \n95% CI 1.67 to 2.44) but for cure this was not the \ncase. The results also appeared to show a noticeable \nplacebo effect. The study by Cardozo and \ncolleagues137 showed a higher OR for improvement \nthan other studies. The reason for this is unclear, \nbut may partly stem from the fact that the study \nrecruited women with SUI only and also provided a \nhigher drug dosage.\nWhile most studies provided treatment for a period \nof 2\u20133 months, one study140 continued treatment \nfor a total of 9 months and provided data on \nimprovement; the results favoured the treatment \ngroup, although the difference was not statistically \nsignificant (Appendix 17, Comparison 14, 49% vs \n41%, OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.01).\nA small number of studies using a daily dosage of \n40, 30 or 20 mg reported similar results. Pooled \ndata for improvement from two studies144,145 using \na daily dosage of 40 and 20 mg showed statistical \nheterogeneity, which may be partly explained by \ndifferent sample populations, with one study145 \nrecruiting women with stress incontinence alone \nand the other144 including women with different \ntypes of incontinence.\nAdverse events\nTable 26 shows the number of participants who \nexperienced any treatment-related adverse events Assessment of clinical effectiveness\n64\nTABLE 25  Baseline characteristics of studies comparing serotonin\u2013noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor drug therapy (duloxetine) with no \ntreatment\nStudy ID\nPopulation \ntype\nDuration \n(month) Comparator N randomised Age\nSupervisory \nintensity\nBump 2004136 1 1 SNRI80 34 NR NA\nNT 31 NR NA\nCardozo 2004137 1 2 SNRI80 55 54.5 NA\nNT 54 52.4 NA\nCastro-Diaz \n2007138\n3 2 SNRI40 b.i.d., \nstarting with 40 \nb.i.d.\n136 53.3 NA\nSNRI40 b.i.d., \nstarting with 40 q.d.\n127 52.3 NA\nSNRI40 b.i.d., \nstarting with 20 \nb.i.d.\n133 53.5 NA\nNT 120 52.7 NA\nDmochowski \n2003139\n3 3 SNRI80 344 52.3 NA\nNT 339 53.3 NA\nGhoniem 200557 1 3 SNRI 52 53.0 NA\nNT 47 51.0 NA\nKinchen 2005140 3 3 SNRI80 224 52.7 NA\nNT 227 53.5 NA\nMah 2006141 3 2 SNRI80 61 50.7 NA\nNT 60 48.5 NA\nManning 2005142 3 2 SNRI80 306 NR NA\nNT 311 NR NA\nMillard 2004143 3 3 SNRI80 227 53.7 NA\nNT 231 52.6 NA\nNorton 2002144 2 3 SNRI80 140 49.3 NA\nSNRI40 137 49.4 NA\nSNRI20 138 49.4 NA\nNT 138 50.2 NA\nvan Kerrebroeck \n2004117\n3 3 SNRI80 247 52.0 NA\nNT 247 54.0 NA\nZinner 1998145 1 1.5 SNRI40 33a NR NA\nSNRI30 26a NR NA\nSNRI20 34a NR NA\nNT 34a NR NA\nNT, no treatment; SNRI80, serotonin\u2013noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors 80 mg per day.\na  n in analysis; total N randomised = 140.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Castro-Diaz and colleagues138 reported \nthat at 4 weeks (when all SNRI-treated participants \nhad had at least 2 weeks\u2019 use of 40 mg twice a day) a \nlow starting dose of 20 mg, twice daily, significantly \nreduced the incidence of nausea and dizziness \ncompared with other drug regimens.\nIt should be noted that the discontinuation rate \namong participants due to adverse events was high, \nat 8\u201334% in the SNRI group, compared with 2\u20138% \nin the placebo group (Table 26).\nSerious adverse events were reported by three \nstudies. One of these studies57 reported one case of \nrectal bleeding in the SNRI group but this was not \nattributed to the study drug. The second study144 \nreported that five subjects had adverse events \nthat required hospitalisation (one event before \nrandomisation, one event in the group taking SNRI \n20 mg per day, two events in the group taking SNRI \n40 mg per day, and one event in the group taking \nSNRI 80 mg per day): only one of these events (a \nrash) was judged by the study authors to be related \nto the study drug. The third study140 recorded \nserious adverse events (details not reported) in \neight of the 224 participants (16 events) in the \nSNRI group and seven of the 227 participants \n(eight events) in the placebo group. Of these, two \nof the events in the placebo group but none in the \nSNRI group was considered by the study author to \nbe related to the study drug (active or placebo).\nQuality of life\nA total of 11 studies provided information on \ncondition-specific quality of life using various \noutcome measures and drug doses (Table 27). \nWith respect to studies using a daily dosage of \n80 mg, all 10 studies favoured SNRI-treated \nparticipants. This difference was reported to be \nstatistically significant in all but two studies117,140 \nthat performed a statistical test. One study138 using \ntwo outcome measures reported consistent results \nfavouring duloxetine. Only three studies reported \ndata amenable to meta-analysis, with one reporting \na total score at the final evaluation,143 and the other \ntwo reporting a change in score from baseline to \nthe final evaluation.137,139 Pooled data from the \ntwo studies137,139 reporting a change in score found \na statistically significant difference between the \ngroups (Appendix 19, Comparison 04, OR 0.35. \n95% CI 0.16 to 0.55).\nOne study140 provided information for a longer \ntreatment duration of 9 months; no significant \ndifference between the groups was reported \n(Appendix 17, Comparison 14).\nTwo studies144,145 used a daily dose of 40, 30 and \n20 mg, with one study145 favouring duloxetine and \nthe other144 reporting no statistically significant \ndifference between SNRI and placebo (Table 27).DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n71\nComparison of different SNRI doses\nTwo small studies144,145 compared different doses \nof SNRI. Data on cure and improvement rates are \nreported in Appendix 17, Comparison 15. In one \nstudy,144 slightly more participants taking a higher \ndose of SNRI were improved than those taking \na lower dose (80 mg: 44%, 57\/130; 40 mg: 37%, \n48\/129; 20 mg: 31%, 41\/132), but no such pattern \nwas found for cure rates (80 mg: 19%, 23\/123; \n40 mg: 24%, 30\/123; 20 mg: 16%, 21\/128). The \nother smaller study145 also did not find any dose \ndependence for improvement rates (40 mg: 45%, \n15\/33; 30 mg: 31%, 8\/26; 20 mg: 44%, 15\/34).\nWith respect to adverse events, the direction of \neffect was consistent across all comparisons, with \nmore participants experiencing adverse events with \na higher dose than with a lower dose (Appendix 17, \nComparison 15).\nThere is no strong evidence to say whether a \nlower dose is associated with a better quality of life \n(Appendix 17, Comparison 16).\nPFMT with adjunct treatment\nThe characteristics of included studies comparing \nPFMT with adjunct treatment versus no treatment \nare summarised in Table 28.\nPFMT plus ES vs no treatment\nCure and improvement\nThree studies121,123,126 compared PFMT with adjunct \nES versus no treatment (Figures 19 and 20). Pooled \ndata from two of these studies with data123,126 \nshowed a higher improvement rate (but not cure \nrate) in the intervention group, although the CI \nwas wide (Figure 20: OR 8.69, 95% CI 1.87 to \n40.32).\nAdverse events\nOnly one study123 reported adverse events: 6% \n(4\/67) of the participants using ES experienced \nvaginal irritation (Table 29).\nQuality of life\nThe same study123 found no significant difference \nbetween the groups in condition-specific quality of \nlife (Table 29) and general quality of life (Appendix \n17, Comparison 17).\nPFMT plus SNRIs vs no treatment\nOne four-arm trial57 reported data for a \ncombination of PFMT plus a drug therapy (SNRI) \ncompared with no treatment (Table 30). The \u2018no-\ntreatment\u2019 arm received placebo drugs and also \nperformed imitation PFMT. The PFMT-plus-SNRI \ngroup was associated with higher improvement \nrates and higher (better) quality of life than the \nno-treatment group. adverse events associated with \nSNRI (with PFMT or imitation PFMT) are reported \nseparately in Table 27. No adverse events associated \nwith PFMT were reported.\nComparison between \ndifferent treatments: single \nmodality\nTable 31 summarises the characteristics of included \nstudies comparing different single interventions. \nPFMT augmented with BF is included here as a \n\u2018single\u2019 intervention.\nPFMT vs ES\nSeven studies provided at least one of the \nspecified primary outcomes.115,124,126,174\u2013177 Of these, \nfive studies, namely Bernardes and colleagues \n(2000),174 B\u00f8 and colleagues (1999),115 Henalla \nand colleagues (1989),124 Hofbauer and colleagues \n(1990)126 and Laycock and colleagues (1988),176 \nprovided intensive supervision (more than two \nsessions per month) for both groups. In addition, \nthe study by B\u00f8 and colleagues (1999)115 also \nprovided intensive supervision for the PFMT group \nbut basic supervision (two or fewer sessions per \nmonth) for the comparator group.\nCure and improvement\nPooled data for cure and improvement indicated \nthat PFMT was more effective than ES in terms \nof both cure (Figure 21: OR 2.65, 95% CI 0.82 to \n8.60) and improvement (Figure 22: OR 2.18, 95% \nCI 0.76 to 6.28). The direction and magnitude \nof effects varied across studies, particularly for \nthe improvement rate which displayed statistical \nheterogeneity at the 10% level (p = 0.070). The \nsource of heterogeneity was unclear. However, it is \nnoteworthy that all but one study (Laycock 1988)176 \nthat provided intensive supervision for the PFMT \ngroup showed ORs (point estimate) of greater than \none (favouring PFMT on average) for both cure \nand improvement data.\nAdverse events and quality of life\nInformation on adverse events and condition-\nspecific quality of life was provided by one small \nstudy only115 (Table 32). In this study, adverse events \nwere experienced in 31% (10\/32) of the participants \nusing ES but none in the PFMT group. Seven \nparticipants in the ES group withdrew. Condition-\nspecific quality-of-life scores were similar for both \ngroups (Table 32).Assessment of clinical effectiveness\n72\nS\nt\nu\nd\ny\nO\nR\n \n(\n9\n5\n%\n \nC\nI\n)\nE\nv\ne\nn\nt\ns\n,\n \nt\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\nE\nv\ne\nn\nt\ns\n,\n \nc\no\nn\nt\nr\no\nl\n%\nW\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\nM\ne\na\ns\nu\nr\ne\nP\no\np\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nt\ny\np\ne\nH\no\nf\nb\na\nu\ne\nr\n \n1\n9\n9\n0\n1\n2\n6\n8\n.\n6\n5\n \n(\n0\n.\n3\n9\n \nt\no\n \n1\n9\n1\n.\n5\n8\n)\n \n3\n\/\n1\n1\n0\n\/\n1\n0\n2\n6\n.\n2\n2\n1\n1\nG\no\no\nd\ne\n \n2\n0\n0\n3\n1\n2\n3\n1\n.\n0\n0\n \n(\n0\n.\n3\n9\n \nt\no\n \n2\n.\n5\n9\n)\n \n1\n0\n\/\n6\n7\n1\n0\n\/\n6\n7\n7\n3\n.\n7\n8\n2\n3\nO\nv\ne\nr\na\nl\nl\n \n(\nI\n2\n=\n \n4\n2\n.\n6\n%\n,\n \np\n=\n \n0\n.\n1\n8\n7\n)\n1\n.\n7\n6\n \n(\n0\n.\n2\n7\n \nt\no\n \n1\n1\n.\n5\n4\n)\n1\n3\n\/\n7\n8\n1\n0\n\/\n7\n7\n1\n0\n0\n.\n0\n0\nN\nO\nT\nE\n:\n \nW\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\ns\n \na\nr\ne\n \nf\nr\no\nm\n \nr\na\nn\nd\no\nm\n \ne\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ns\n \na\nn\na\nl\ny\ns\ni\ns\n1\n0\n.\n0\n0\n5\n2\n2\n1\n9\n2\nF\na\nv\no\nu\nr\ns\n \nN\nT\nF\na\nv\no\nu\nr\ns\n \nP\nF\nM\nT\n+\nE\nS\nS\nt\nu\nd\ny\nO\nR\n \n(\n9\n5\n%\n \nC\nI\n)\nE\nv\ne\nn\nt\ns\n,\n \nt\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\nE\nv\ne\nn\nt\ns\n,\n \nc\no\nn\nt\nr\no\nl\n%\nW\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\nM\ne\na\ns\nu\nr\ne\nP\no\np\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nt\ny\np\ne\nH\no\nf\nb\na\nu\ne\nr\n \n1\n9\n9\n0\n1\n2\n6\n3\n5\n.\n0\n0\n \n(\n1\n.\n6\n3\n \nt\no\n \n7\n5\n2\n.\n7\n1\n)\n \n7\n\/\n1\n1\n0\n\/\n1\n0\n2\n3\n.\n7\n9\n1\n1\nG\no\no\nd\ne\n \n2\n0\n0\n3\n1\n2\n3\n5\n.\n6\n3\n \n(\n1\n.\n1\n2\n \nt\no\n \n2\n8\n.\n2\n7\n)\n \n4\n5\n\/\n4\n7\n3\n2\n\/\n4\n0\n7\n6\n.\n2\n1\n1\n3\nO\nv\ne\nr\na\nl\nl\n \n(\nI\n2\n=\n \n7\n.\n5\n%\n,\n \np\n=\n \n0\n.\n2\n9\n9\n)\n8\n.\n6\n9\n \n(\n1\n.\n8\n7\n \nt\no\n \n4\n0\n.\n3\n2\n)\n5\n2\n\/\n5\n8\n3\n2\n\/\n5\n0\n1\n0\n0\n.\n0\n0\nN\nO\nT\nE\n:\n \nW\ne\ni\ng\nh\nt\ns\n \na\nr\ne\n \nf\nr\no\nm\n \nr\na\nn\nd\no\nm\n \ne\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ns\n \na\nn\na\nl\ny\ns\ni\ns\nF\na\nv\no\nu\nr\ns\n \nN\nT\nF\na\nv\no\nu\nr\ns\n \nP\nF\nM\nT\n+\nE\nS\n1\n0\n.\n0\n0\n1\n3\n3\n7\n5\n3\nF\nI\nG\nU\nR\nE\n \n1\n9\n \nC\nu\nr\ne\n \nr\na\nt\ne\ns\n:\n \np\ne\nl\nv\ni\nc\n \nfl\no\no\nr\n \nm\nu\ns\nc\nl\ne\n \nt\nr\na\ni\nn\ni\nn\ng\n \na\nn\nd\n \ne\nl\ne\nc\nt\nr\ni\nc\na\nl\n \ns\nt\ni\nm\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nv\ne\nr\ns\nu\ns\n \nn\no\n \nt\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\n.\nF\nI\nG\nU\nR\nE\n \n2\n0\n \nI\nm\np\nr\no\nv\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \nr\na\nt\ne\ns\n:\n \np\ne\nl\nv\ni\nc\n \nfl\no\no\nr\n \nm\nu\ns\nc\nl\ne\n \nt\nr\na\ni\nn\ni\nn\ng\n \na\nn\nd\n \ne\nl\ne\nc\nt\nr\ni\nc\na\nl\n \ns\nt\ni\nm\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nv\ne\nr\ns\nu\ns\n \nn\no\n \nt\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\n.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The other studies provided basic \nsupervision for both groups.\nCure and improvement\nThere appeared to be no clear differences between \nPFMT, with or without BF, and VCs (Figures 23 \nand 24). One study by B\u00f8 and colleagues (1999)115 \nstands out, showing a relatively higher OR \nfavouring PFMT. It is not clear why this is the case. \nOne explanation may be a longer training duration \nand more supervisory sessions for the PFMT group \nrelative to other studies.\nAdverse events\nFour studies115,129,179,181 reported adverse events \n(Table 33). The first study115 reported that \n62% (18\/29) of participants in the VCs group \nexperienced adverse events, compared with none \nin the PFMT group. The second study179 did \nnot report any data but noted that PFMT was \nassociated with difficulty remembering to use \nthe technique, whereas participants using cones \nreported aesthetic dislike of the technique as well \nas difficulties associated with vaginal prolapse, \nresulting for some in discontinuation of the cone \ntreatment. In the third study,129 there were two \ncases of urinary tract infection in both groups \nbut no other side effects were reported by the \nparticipants. The fourth study181 reported that 47% \n(14\/30) in the cones group experienced adverse \nevents and subsequently discontinued treatment, \ncompared with none in the PFMT-plus-BF group.\nQuality of life\nTwo studies129,152 found no statistically significant \ndifferences between groups in condition-specific \nquality of life (Table 33).\nPFMT, with or without BF, vs BT\nCure and improvement\nTwo studies182,183 compared PFMT (with or without \nBF) with BT (Table 34). The first study182 recruited \nwomen with SUI only (population type 1) and \nreported cure rates of 48% (19\/40) for PFMT and \n26% (9\/35) for BT immediately after the supervised \ntreatment phase (OR 2.61, 95% CI 0.98 to 6.96). \nThe difference was not statistically significant. \nThe other study183 included women with other \nurinary incontinence symptoms (population \ntype 2) and similarly found no clear difference \nbetween groups in cure and improvement at the \nend of the supervised treatment phase (Table 34: \ncure 13% vs 18%; improvement 76% vs 65%), and \n3 months after the end of the treatment phase \n(Appendix 17, Comparison 18: cure 20% vs 16%; \nimprovement 70% vs 62%).

In one study182 that performed \na statistical test, the difference was found to be \nstatistically significant. General HRQoL scores \n[Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)] were similar \nfor both groups in one study182 that reported this \noutcome (Appendix 17, Comparison 18).\nPFMT vs SNRI (80 mg)\nOne study57 compared PFMT (with placebo drug) \nwith SNRI (with imitation PFMT). The results \nshowed greater improvement and better condition-\nspecific quality of life in the PFMT group, although \nthe difference was not statistically significant  \n(Table 35).\nPFMT vs surgery\nData on cure and improvement from two \nstudies184,185 comparing PFMT with surgery \nare shown in Figures 25 and 26. One of these \nstudies184 compared PFMT with either Burch \ncolposuspension, vaginal repair or combined \nprocedures, whereas the other study185 compared \nPFMT with Burch colposuspension. The results \nfor both cure and improvement favoured surgery \n(Figures 25 and 26: OR for cure 0.08, 95% CI 0.03 \nto 0.23; OR for improvement 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to \n0.77). However, no information was reported on \nadverse events or quality of life.\nES vs VC: cure and \nimprovement\nFigures 27 and 28 show pooled data from three \nstudies115,187,188 reporting the number of women \ncured or improved after treatment with ES \ncompared with VCs. No statistically significant \ndifference between the groups was found (Figures \n27 and 28: OR for cure 1.00, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.91, \nOR for improvement 1.30, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.84).\nOne of these studies187 provided data at 6 months \nafter the initial treatment phase had finished and \nfound no statistically significant difference between \nthe groups in terms of cure (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.31 \nto 2.78) or improvement (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.17 to \n1.68) (Appendix 17, Comparison 19).\nES vs VC: adverse events\nOne study115 indicated that more participants \nexperienced adverse events in the VC group \n(62%) than in the ES group (31%), although \ndiscontinuation due to adverse events was more \ncommon in the ES group (7\/32) than in the VC \ngroup (1\/29) (Table 36). Another study,187 which \nused cones to assess pelvic floor muscle strength in \nboth groups, reported that nine women withdrew \nbecause of a failure to tolerate the cones during \npretreatment assessment. In seven of these women, \nthe vagina was too narrow and the cones \u2018wedged\u2019. \nThe same study187 reported a further two adverse \nevents (one psychiatric disorder and one death) \nin the cones group, which were considered by \nthe study author to be unrelated to the study \nintervention.\nES vs VC: quality of life\nThe information on condition-specific quality of \nlife was available from one study only.115 The results \nwere similar for both groups (Table 36).\nComparison between \ndifferent treatments: dual \nmodality\nThe characteristics of included studies comparing a \nsingle intervention with an intervention combined \nwith an adjunct treatment are summarised in Table \n37.

The data \nimmediately after the 3-month treatment phase \nwere reported separately for women with stress \nincontinence alone and suggested higher quality \nof life for the combined treatment compared with \nBT without PFMT and BF (Table 44). The data \nat 6 months (3 months after the end of 3-month \ntreatment) were reported for all participants \nwith SUI, UUI and MUI; the direction of effect \nremained in favour of the combined treatment \n(Appendix 17, Comparison 22). Among 38 women \nwho did not seek additional treatment before the \n3.2 years\u2019 follow-up, however, quality of life did not \ndiffer significantly between groups (Appendix 17, \nComparison 22).\nPFMT plus SNRI vs SNRI\nOne study57 compared PFMT plus drug therapy \n(SNRI) with drug therapy alone (Table 45). The \napparent greater improvement and better quality \nof life in the combined therapy group was not \nstatistically different from the group using drug \ntherapy alone.\nSummary\nA summary of the effect sizes based on meta-\nanalyses of cure and improvement data are given \nin Tables 46 and 47. Overall, it appears that most \nstandalone interventions had, on average, higher \ncure and improvement rates than no (active) \ntreatment. In particular, PFMT with or without BF \nwas more effective than no treatment.\nThere was insufficient evidence from direct \ncomparisons to say whether PFMT was more \neffective than other modalities of treatment or \nwhich of the PFMT programmes was the most \neffective. Nevertheless, PFMT with additional \nsupervisory sessions (or any face-to-face contacts \nwith health-care professionals) appeared more \neffective than PFMT alone. PFMT augmented \nwith BF was also associated with higher cure \nand improvement rates. With respect to PFMT \ncombined with adjunct treatment (e.g. PFMT plus \nES), it was not possible to draw firm conclusions \ndue to the small number of studies identified from \nour searches.\nQuality-of-life measures reported in included \nstudies were highly variable, which made \nTABLE 45a  Improvement rates: pelvic floor muscle training plus serotonin\u2013noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) versus SNRI\nPFMT + SNRI SNRI\nOR (95% CI) Measure\nPopulation \ntype n\/N % n\/N %\nGhoniem 200557 36\/51 71 27\/50 54 2.04 (0.90 to 4.64), p = 0.087 1 1\nTABLE 45b  Quality of life: improvement rates: pelvic floor muscle training plus serotonin\u2013noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) \nversus SNRI\nPFMT + SNRI SNRI\nNotes Population type N Value N Value\nI-QoL\nGhoniem 200557 51 13.1 50 8.3 Change in score (mean \npercentage score increase)\n1Assessment of clinical effectiveness\n92\nTABLE 46  Summary table: odds ratio for cure rate\nIntervention 1 Intervention 2\nNumber of \ntrials in MA \n(total)\nNumber of \nparticipants in \nMA OR 95% CI p-value\nComparison with no treatment\nPFMT NT 8 (14) 605 5.41 1.64 to 17.82 0.005\nPFMT + BF NT 2 (2) 110 21.54 3.65 to 126.98 0.001\nES NT 6 (8) 288 1.10 0.41 to 2.94 0.849\nVC NT 0 (2)\nSNRI80 NT 3 (11) 1292 1.46 1.00 to 2.14 0.053\nSNRI40 NT 1 (2) 255 1.81 0.96 to 3.39 0.065\nSNRI30 NT 0 (1)\nSNRI20 NT 1 (2) 260 1.10 0.56 to 2.14 0.781\nBT NT 1 (1) 123 4.03 0.80 to 20.23 0.091\nPFMT + ES NT 2 (3) 155 1.76 0.27 to 11.54 0.556\nPFMT + SNRI NT 0 (1)\nSingle modality\nPFMT ES 5 (7) 124 2.65 0.82 to 8.60 0.105\nPFMT VC 3 (6) 245 0.61 0.09 to 3.95 0.606\nPFMT + BF VC 1 (2) 46 0.86 0.25 to 2.93 0.806\nPFMT BT 1 (1) 75 2.61 0.98 to 6.96 0.055\nPFMT + BF BT 1 (1) 132 0.67 0.25 to 1.76 0.412\nPFMT SNRI 0 (1)\nPFMT Surgery 2 (2) 95 0.08 0.03 to 0.23 < 0.001\nES VC 2 (4) 106 1.00 0.26 to 3.91 0.998\nDual modality\nPFMT PFMT + ES 4 (7) 133 1.02 0.29 to 3.55 0.976\nPFMT + BF PFMT + BF + ES 0 (2)\nPFMT PFMT + VC 1 (1) 46 0.44 0.09 to 2.10 0.300\nPFMT + BF PFMT + BF + BT 1 (1) 125 0.32 0.13 to 0.79 0.014\nPFMT PFMT + SNRI 0 (1)\nPFMT + ES ES 1 (1) 22 3.75 0.33 to 43.31 0.290\nPFMT + VC VC 0 (1)\nPFMT + BF + BT  BT 1 (1) 129 2.11 0.92 to 4.82 0.076\nPFMT + SNRI80 SNRI80 0 (1)\nVariation within comparators\nFluid increase then \ndecrease\nFluid, decrease then \nincrease\n0 (1)\nPFMT PFMT + BF 8 (15) 370 0.48 0.30 to 0.77 0.002\nPFMT PFMT with additional \nsessions\n3 (4) 118 0.11 0.03 to 0.43 0.001\nPFMT PFMT with audiotape 0 (2)\nStrength and motor \nlearning PFMT\nMortor learning \nPFMT alone\n1 (1) 123 0.24 0.03 to 2.23 0.210\nPFMT (in supine) + BF PFMT (in supine and \nupright) + BF\n0 (1)\nPFMT Modified pilates 0 (1)DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Mixed \ntreatment comparison (MTC) models analyse \nall of the treatments in one model, allowing \nindirect evidence to supplement direct, head-to-\nhead evidence and thereby making comparison \nof treatments easier than via multiple head-to-\nhead analyses.113 The model produces estimates \n(from direct and indirect evidence) of the OR for \neach pair of treatments and then the cure and \nimprovement rates of each individual treatment. \nCure and improvement are defined in Chapter \n5 (see Types of outcome measures). The rest of \nthis chapter describes the data used, discusses \nthe technical issues surrounding the application \nof a MTC model to these data and gives some \ndefinitions of important terms in Bayesian statistics \nthat are used in the chapter, followed by results, \ndiscussion and summary of the work.\nThe data\nThe cured and improved outcomes were analysed \nin separate models. The searches identified 61 \ntrials which have data on either or both of these \noutcomes. Fourteen treatments were included in \nthe MTC analysis. The standard abbreviations for \nthe treatments are used throughout this chapter \n(see List of abbreviations). Six trials (Table 48) were \nremoved from the data set either because they \ncompared one treatment on the list of treatments \nselected with one that was not, for example \nKlarskov and colleagues (1986),184 or because they \ncompared two varieties of the same treatment and \nit was decided that separating treatments down \nto that level of detail was unhelpful, for example \nBurton (1993).173 Some trials included some \ntreatments that did not meet the inclusion criteria \nof this review, for example Tapp and colleagues \n(1989),185 compares PFMT, PFMT plus ES, and \nsurgery. In this case the surgery arm was not \nincluded in the analysis.\nRemoving these six trials resulted in 55 trials being \nused; of which eight reported cure results only, 17 \nreported improved results only and 30 reported \nboth. Therefore, 38 trials were included in the \ncured analysis and 47 in the improved analysis.\nThe success rates in each trial were assessed by \neither the patient or by a clinician, with some \ntrials reporting both. As for the direct, head-\nto-head meta-analyses, the patient-reported \nmeasure was used when it was available, with the \nclinician-reported measure being used as a proxy \nfor it when the patient-reported measure was \nunavailable (see Model assumptions). The time \nbetween intervention and measurement of success \nvaried across trials from 10 days to 6 months. \nSome trials also reported additional, long-term \nfollow-up.150,157,172,183,187 Each trial appears once \nin the model, using the data collected at the first \ntime that the outcome was measured. This assumes \nthat the measurement was taken at the point in \ntime when the trialists believed that the treatments \nwould have their maximal effect.\nTable 49 shows which treatments are compared \nin each trial and the number of patients in each \narm. A MTC model requires all treatments of \ninterest to be connected to each other, which was \nthe case for both the cured and the improved data \nsets (i.e. if trial 1 compares treatments A and B, \ntrial 2 compares treatments B and C, and trial 3 \ncompares treatments C and D, then A is connected \nto C through a path of trial 1, then trial 2 and A \nis connected to D through a path of trial 1, trial 2 \nand trial 3; an MTC model can only be applied if \nall pairs of treatments in a model have a path of \ntrials that connect them). A total of 6608 patients \nwere involved in the 55 trials, with 3560 providing \ndata for cure and 6140 for improvement. It should \nbe noted that a large proportion of these patients \n(36.3%, 1292\/3560 for cure and 61.4%, 3772\/6140 \nfor improvement) come from the 10 trials testing \nSNRIs against a placebo (placebo being considered \nequivalent to \u2018no treatment\u2019). The cure model \nconsidered 13 treatments and the improvement \nmodel considered 14 treatments, as there were no \ncure data for the PFMT plus SNRI treatment.\nChapter 8  \nMixed-treatment comparisons \n(direct and indirect)Mixed-treatment comparisons (direct and indirect)\n98\nTABLE 48  Trials not used in the models, with reasons\nTrial Reason\nBurton 1993173 Comparison of \u2018passive\u2019 VC and \u2018active\u2019 VC\nHay-Smith 2003164 Comparison of \u2018motor learning\u2019 with and without PFMT\nJohnson 2001167 Comparison of PFMT + BF with maximal contraction and submaximal contraction\nKlarskov 1986184 Comparison of PFMT and surgery; surgery not included in the data set\nMayne 1998168 Comparison of PFMT with perineometer and PFMT with urethral conductance\nZinner 1998145 Comparison of no treatment with 20- and 40-mg doses of SNRI\nAn important difference between the MTC model \nand the head-to-head comparisons is that PFMT \nhas been separated into two treatments: \u2018PFMT \nbasic\u2019 and \u2018PFMT extra sessions\u2019, where \u2018PFMT \nextra sessions\u2019 is defined as having more than two \nsupervised sessions per month (see Chapter 6, \nCharacteristics of included studies).43 The models \nfor each outcome were analysed twice, once with \nPFMT split into the two categories and once with \nit together as one treatment. This latter model \nis to facilitate comparison with the direct, head-\nto-head analyses. However, three trials116,159,161 \nare solely comparisons of the two intensities of \nPFMT, and as they provide no comparison with \nany other treatments they were removed from the \ndata set when considering PFMT as one treatment. \nHence, the former model, which considers the \ntwo intensities of PFMT separately, is taken as the \nbase-case analysis and is presented in this chapter. \nThe results from the models with PFMT considered \nas one treatment (regardless of the number of \nsessions) are shown in Appendix 23.\nThe model\nThe model used was developed by the Multi-\nparameter Evidence Synthesis (MPES) Programme \nat the University of Bristol.202 The statistical \ntheory behind the code can be found in Lu and \nAdes (2004),203 Caldwell and colleagues (2005),113 \nLu and Ades (2006),204 and Ades and colleagues \n(2006).205 Its main parameters are the log ORs of \neach treatment compared to a reference treatment, \nfor which we used \u2018no treatment\u2019. A random effects \nmodel was adopted, and, as some of the trials \ninvolved had three or four arms that were relevant \nto the study, the multiarm version of the MTC \nmodel was used. This incorporates adjustments for \nthe correlation between arms of the same trial. The \nmodel parameters are estimated within Bayesian \nmethodology by the use of winbugs software.114 The \nmodel code, currently available from the MPES \nwebsite,202 is given in Appendix 22, alongside the \ndata used from the individual trials.\nModel assumptions\nThe data that were available required the following \ntwo key additional assumptions to be made before \nusing the model (as previously suggested \u2013 see The \ndata):\n1.  that the log OR of the success of any treatment \ncompared to the no-treatment reference is \nthe same when success is assessed using the \nclinician methods as when it is assessed by the \npatient\n2.  that the log OR of the success of any treatment \ncompared to the no-treatment reference is \nindependent of the time period at which the \noutcome was assessed.\n\u2018No-treatment\u2019 cure rate and \nimprovement rate\nAlthough the main parameters of the model are \nthe log ORs of pairs of treatments, other statistics \ncan be calculated from the parameters. The cure \nand improvement rates for each treatment can be \ncalculated from the ORs if the success rate for one \ntreatment is known. The distribution of the success \nrate of the reference treatment was estimated by \napplying a normal distribution to the log odds \nof the probability of success, with its mean and \nvariance being estimated from a random effects \nmodel of the no-treatment arms of the studies \ninvolved (see Appendix 22).\nTechnical information about the \nrunning of the model\nVague prior distributions are used on the necessary \nparameters: the log ORs of treatment to no \ntreatment, the individual trial baselines and the \nrandom effects standard deviation \u2013 see Appendix \n22 for further details. The model was run on four \ndifferent data sets; the cure and improvement \ndata sets, with and without the PFMT treatment \nbeing split into basic and extra sessions. For the \ncure data set, a burn-in period of 20,000 iterations DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO. All rights reserved.\n99\nwas used to ensure convergence, whereas for \nthe improvement data set a burn-in period of \n10,000 iterations was sufficient for convergence. \nThe results were sampled for a further 100,000 \niterations in both cases.\nBayesian terminology\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Bayesian \nmethodology, a few terms used in the results \nsection need to be explained. A good introduction \nto Bayesian methods can be found in O\u2019Hagan and \nLuce\u2019s primer for health economics.206\n\u2022  Distribution  The Bayesian method uses \nprobability distributions to describe the \nuncertainty about a parameter, for example \nthe OR between two treatments. The posterior \ndistribution is the probability distribution gained \nfrom applying the data to the model. The \nposterior distribution is described through its \nsummary statistics, such as the mean, median \nand percentiles. The phrase \u2018the median odds \nratio between \u2026\u2019 should be interpreted as \u2018the \nmedian of the posterior distribution of the \nodds ratio between \u2026\u2019.\n\u2022  Ninety-five per cent central credible interval  A 95% \ncredible interval is one where the probability \nthat the true value for the parameter is within \nthat interval is 95%. The interval is central \nif, in addition, the probability of being below \nthe credible interval is 2.5% and being above \nit is 2.5%. Bayesian analyses report credible \nintervals for similar reasons to the reporting \nof CIs in frequentist analysis (e.g. the direct, \npairwise, meta-analyses in this report are \nperformed using frequentist statistical \ninference), i.e. to give an indication of the \nuncertainty surrounding the estimate. The \nabbreviation CrI is used for (central) credible \ninterval.\nResults\nIn this section we report the ORs between \ntreatments. The posterior distributions of the ORs \nare generally skewed. Therefore, we report the \nmedian OR as the point estimate. As the log ORs \nare roughly symmetrical, Figures 31 and 32 are \nplotted on the log odds scale, although labelled \nwith the ORs.\nTable 50 shows the posterior distribution of the ORs \nfor each treatment compared with no treatment for \nboth the cure and the improvement models. These \nare shown graphically in Figures 31 and 32. Tables \nshowing the distributions of the ORs for each pair \nof treatments are given in Appendix 23. For cure, \nall treatments when compared to no treatment \nhave a median OR greater than one, indicating \nthat on average they have higher cure rates than \nno treatment. PFMT extra sessions, PFMT plus \nBF, VCs, BT, PFMT plus ES and PFMT plus BT \nand BF all have their 2.5th percentile greater than \none, indicating a benefit from the treatment. For \nimprovement, the median ORs for all treatments \ncompared with no treatment were greater than one, \nwith all 2.5th percentiles being greater than one, \nexcept for PFMT plus VCs and BF, and PFMT plus \nSNRI. For both outcomes the treatment with the \nhighest median OR is PFMT plus BT and BF. This \ntreatment, however, appears in only one trial183 and \nhas 61 participants in the PFMT-plus-BT-and-BF \narm. Its success rate is high for both cure (19\/61, \n31.1%) and improvement (55\/61, 90.2%). Given \nthat the data come from only one trial, further \nresearch is needed.\nSplitting of PFMT into basic and \nextra sessions\nThe results show that the number of sessions of \nPFMT does have an effect. For cure, the combined \nPFMT has an OR of 4.56 (95% CrI 1.95 to12.4) \nagainst no treatment, but on splitting by number \nof sessions, PFMT basic (two or fewer sessions per \nmonth) has an OR of 1.28 (95% CrI 0.554 to 2.92), \nwhereas PFMT with extra sessions (more than two \nsessions per month) has an OR of 10.7 (95% CrI \n5.03 to 26.2). The OR for PFMT with extra sessions \ncompared with PFMT basic is 8.36 (95% CrI 3.74 \nto 21.7). For improvement a similar relationship \nappears, with combined PFMT having an OR \ncompared with no treatment of 8.97 (95% CrI 4.4 \nto 20.8), whereas the model with PFMT separated \ninto basic or with extra sessions has an OR for \nPFMT basic of 4.47 (95% CrI 2.03 to 10.9) and \nfor PFMT extra sessions of 25.7 (95% CrI 10.3 to \n73.1). The OR between PFMT with extra sessions \nand PFMT basic is 5.75 (95% CrI 2.11 to 16.2). \nThe results from the combined PFMT models are \ngiven in Appendix 23.\nTreatment success rates\nThe cure and improvement rates for each \nindividual treatment are shown in Table 51, \nand, graphically, in Figures 33 and 34.

The width of the 95% CrIs \nsuggests that there is still considerable uncertainty \nsurrounding the success rates.\nNevertheless, PFMT extra sessions appears to have \na higher cure rate than PFMT basic and a similar \nrate to PFMT plus BF. In fact, PFMT extra sessions, \nPFMT plus BF, and PFMT plus BT and BF appear \nto be the best treatments in terms of cure, bearing \nin mind that PFMT plus BT and BF is assessed in \nonly one trial. These three treatments also have the \nhighest median improvement rate.\nSensitivity analysis\nIn the cure model, two treatments, \u2018PFMT plus \nVCs and BF\u2019 and \u2018PFMT plus BT and BF\u2019, appear \nin only one trial. PFMT plus SNRI, which appears \nonly in the improvement model, was also only \nreported in one trial. As a sensitivity analysis to the \ninclusion of these three treatments, the cure and \nimprovement models were run without them. This \nresulted in one trial132 being removed from the \ndata set.

Note: posterior distribution median (circle) with 95% \ncentral credible intervals. The horizontal axis is plotted on the log scale.Mixed-treatment comparisons (direct and indirect)\n106\nThe output from the MTC model shows wide \ncredible intervals for some treatments. For \nexample, the intervals for the cure rates for \u2018PFMT \nplus ES and BF\u2019 and \u2018PFMT plus VCs and BF\u2019 are \nso wide (on a bounded scale) that we know very \nlittle about the effectiveness of these treatments. \nThis is due to there being very few data about the \ncure rates for these treatments; the data for each \ntreatment come from only one trial, with \u2018PFMT \nplus ES and BF\u2019 having 46 participants in its arm \nand \u2018PFMT plus VCs and BF\u2019 having 16.\nThere are some results that are quite clear and \nuseful. There is clear evidence that both \u2018PFMT \nwith extra sessions\u2019 and \u2018PFMT with BF\u2019 are better \nat cure than the following: no treatment; PFMT \nbasic; ES; VCs; SNRI; and PFMT plus ES. Both \n\u2018PFMT with extra sessions\u2019 and \u2018PFMT with BF\u2019 \nare also better at improvement than: no treatment; \nPFMT basic; ES; VCs; and SNRI. The evidence \nalso suggests that \u2018PFMT plus BT and BF\u2019 is better \nthan each of the above listed treatments for cure \nand improvement, respectively, except for VCs, for \nwhich there is no clear evidence of a difference in \nimprovement rates. However, conclusions about \n\u2018PFMT plus BT and BF\u2019 must be considered with \ncaution, as this appears as a treatment in only one \ntrial.\nThe results of the model indicate where further \nresearch might be beneficial, for example \u2018PFMT \nplus BT and BF\u2019 had reasonable success in the one \ntrial that is in the data set, and its comparisons with \nother treatments look promising.\nComparison of the results from the model with \nPFMT, separated into basic and extra sessions with \nthe combined PFMT model, shows that the median \nORs between the other treatments can be different. \nThe nature of the MTC model is such that \nsplitting a treatment into two has an effect on the \ncomparisons between other treatments. However, \nthe split PFMT models do include additional trials \n(three for cure and two for improvement) that \ncompare the two PFMT intensities alone, which \nwere not used in the combined PFMT model. This \nappears to account for most of the discrepancies \nbetween the results of the split PFMT model \ncompared with the combined PFMT model.\nSummary\nPFMT appears to be more effective when delivered \nwith extra sessions (more than two sessions per \nmonth). Using this format of PFMT or adding \nBF to PFMT appears to be more effective than \nthe other standalone treatments that have been \nTABLE 51  Cure and improvement success rates for each treatment, as percentages\nCure Improvement\nN Median 95% central CrI N Median 95% central CrI\nNT 1139 5.8 3.3 9.9 2200 26.3 15.7 40.5\nPFMT basic 331 7.3 2.8 17.8 394 61.5 36.4 82.7\nPFMT extra \nsessions\n360 39.9 20.2 65.8 276 90.2 74.9 96.9\nPFMT + BF 273 43.3 21.5 70.2 250 90.1 72.0 97.3\nES 231 8.2 2.8 21.9 298 66.3 40.6 85.8\nVC 164 18.0 6.1 43.5 283 70.8 43.1 89.3\nSNRI 609 8.1 2.9 20.1 1939 43.3 22.7 66.7\nBT 163 31.8 11.2 65.3 126 81.1 40.5 96.7\nPFMT + ES 108 15.9 5.4 42.8 81 88.1 58.3 97.8\nPFMT + ES + BF 46 36.1 3.2 91.8 129 88.5 58.5 97.9\nPFMT + VC 59 16.1 1.8 70.3 36 81.4 36.7 97.5\nPFMT + VC + BF 16 26.4 1.4 94.4 16 48.7 5.7 94.1\nPFMT + BT 61 60.8 21.8 90.7 61 96.1 68.4 99.7\nPFMT + SNRI 331 51 61.2 17.1 92.5DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The remainder of the Methods section \ndescribes, in detail, how parameter estimates for \nthe economic model were derived and how these \ndata were used to estimate cost-effectiveness. The \nresults from the economic model are presented in \nthree sections. In the first section, the results of the \neconomic model are presented in terms of number \nof people cured, cured or improved (referred \nto in the text as \u2018improvement\u2019) or incontinent in \nthe model at different time horizons (see Results \nof the model presented in terms of costs and \nconsequences). In the second section the results are \nbased upon patients being cured of incontinence \n(see Cost\u2013utility analysis based upon cure rates). \nIn the third section (see Results based upon \nimprovement rates), results are presented when \nsuccessful treatment is defined as being either \ncured or improved. The final section of this chapter \nprovides a short summary of the results.\nMethods\nAs explained in Chapter 3, the economic model \ndescribed the pathways of care for alternative \nmanagement strategies of SUI. The perspective \nadopted for the analysis is that of the NHS (the \nmain health service provider within the UK).\nModel framework\nA Markov model portraying the temporal and \nlogical sequence of the clinical decision problem \nwas used to provide estimates of costs, effectiveness \n(measured in QALYs) and cost-effectiveness. The \nhealth states within the model are considered to \nreflect possible outcomes of therapy, for example \nsuccessful treatment (i.e. cure or improvement), \nfailure (i.e. incontinence) and recurrence of \nincontinence. Graduation in the severity of \nincontinence was otherwise not considered in \nthe model due to paucity of the available data on \neffectiveness.\nIn the model, women receive an initial treatment \nand then move into one of three states: success, \nfailure or death. If a woman considers herself cured \n(or sufficiently improved so that she no longer feels \nthe need for further treatment) then the treatment \nis successful. If the treatment does not result in cure \n(or sufficient improvement) then the woman enters \nthe failure state. There is always a chance that over \nany period of time that a woman would die. If this \nshould happen, they then move into an absorbing \nstate (a state from which they cannot move): \ndeath. Death takes into account that patients are \nexposed to a very small risk of death when they are \nundergo surgery as well as a chance of dying from \nother causes at any point in time, assumed to be \nequivalent to all-cause mortality.\nIn a Markov model, people stay in a state for a \nminimum period of time (called the cycle length). \nIn this model the cycle length was 3 months. \nThis cycle length was chosen as it represents the \nrecommended\/widely used duration of PFMT \nbefore reassessment. Women who enter into the \nsuccess state, stay in that state for 3 months, \nafter which time, if they are still alive, they either \ncontinue to stay in this state or suffer a recurrence \nand go to the next available treatment. If a woman \nbecomes incontinent after previously being cured, \nor after a treatment has failed, she proceeds to the \nnext treatment in the strategy.\nWomen can continue moving through states in the \nmodel for a maximum of 40 years (equivalent to \n160 cycles). This time horizon was chosen as it takes \ninto account the average life expectancy of women \nwho enter the model at the age of 45, which, as \nFigure 1 shows, is that age of peak incidence of \nSUI. Costs and benefits that occur in the future \nare discounted following standard practice. The \ndiscount rate used is the recommended rate of \n3.5% for both costs and benefits.105\nChapter 9  \nAssessment of cost-effectivenessAssessment of cost-effectiveness\n110\nIt is assumed that all women are initially given \nadvice, if appropriate, about modifying their \nlifestyles. The interventions included in the \nmanagement strategies are thus: lifestyle changes \n(LS); basic PFMT (PFMT basic); PFMT with extra \nsessions (PFMT extra sessions); PFMT plus BF; \nPFMT plus ES; ES; VCs; drug treatment (SNRI), \nsurgery [tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) or other \nsimilar self-fixing sling, e.g. transvaginal obturator \ntape], and the second surgery. Once all of the \ntreatments are exhausted, it is assumed that women \nhave to manage their symptoms using containment \nproducts. Table 52 summarises the potential \nstrategies that are considered in the model.\nThe difference between basic PFMT and PFMT \nwith extra sessions was based upon the number of \nsupervisory sessions that a woman had per month. \nFor basic PFMT it was assumed that the woman \nwould have six sessions in 3 months, whereas \nPFMT with extra sessions was defined as having 12 \nsessions in 3 months.43\nPelvic floor muscle training with BF has not been \nexplicitly included in this model, as its effectiveness \nis similar to the effectiveness of PFMT with extra \nsessions and it is plausible that the costs of the \ntwo types of therapy are similar. The impact of \ndifference in costs for PFMT with BF is explored \nwithin a sensitivity analysis.\nTABLE 52  Management strategies\nTreatment sequence\nFirst treatment\nSecond \ntreatment\nThird \ntreatment\nFourth \ntreatment\nFifth \ntreatment\nSixth \ntreatment\n1 Lifestyle + PFMT basic TVT\/TVT-O Second surgery Containment\n2 Lifestyle + PFMT basic PFMT extra \nsessions\nTVT\/TVT-O Second surgery Containment\n3 Lifestyle + PFMT basic PFMT extra \nsessions\nSNRI TVT\/TVT-O Second surgery Containment\n4 Lifestyle + PFMT extra \nsessions\nTVT\/TVT-O Second surgery Containment\n5 Lifestyle + PFMT extra \nsessions\nSNRI TVT\/TVT-O Second surgery Containment\n6 Lifestyle TVT\/TVT-O Second surgery Containment\n7a Lifestyle + PFMT basic VC TVT\/TVT-O Second surgery Containment\n8a Lifestyle + PFMT basic ES TVT\/TVT-O Second surgery Containment\nTVT, tension-free vaginal tape; TVT-O, transvaginal obturator tape.\na  Two strategies reported in sensitivity analyses only.\nFigure 35 depicts an example of one of the \nmanagement strategies used in the model (a more \ndetailed description of the model is provided in \nAppendix 24). A woman that is diagnosed with \nSUI is offered PFMT. If this treatment is successful \nthen the patient stays in a success state. When \na treatment fails the woman is offered the next \navailable treatment in that particular strategy. \nIn this example, if PFMT fails in the next cycle \nthe woman is offered PFMT plus an adjunct. If \nthis fails, the woman is offered the next available \ntreatment, drug therapy, and so on. If necessary \nthe woman will receive each treatment until \nthe treatment options are exhausted and their \nincontinence has to be managed with containment \nproducts.\nSummary of key assumptions \nmade in the economic model\nOutlined below are the key assumptions that are \nmade within the economic model. Details about \nhow these assumptions were arrived at and their \njustifications are provided in the remainder of this \nsection.\nAssumptions related to the structure of \nthe model\n1.

Cumulative costs and effectiveness were \nestimated for a 40-year time horizon. This \nwould cover the average life expectancy of \nwomen aged 45 years. In sensitivity analyses \nthe effect of shorter time horizons on costs, \neffects and cost-effectiveness was considered.\n3.  Costs and effects that occur in the future are \ngiven less weight in the analysis than costs and \neffects that occur in the present, i.e. they are \ndiscounted. This is recommended practice for \nany economic evaluation. Different discount \nrates were considered in a sensitivity analysis.\n4.  The cycle length of the model is 3 months. \nThis cycle length determines the minimum \nperiod of time over which a woman\u2019s \ncontinence status might change or over which \ntreatments might change. This period was \nchosen as it represents the recommended\/\nwidely used duration of PFMT before \nreassessment.\n5.  Within the model, women can either be cured \n(or improved in the version of the model based \non improvement rates) or be incontinent. \nSeverity of disease is not otherwise considered \nin the model because of lack of data.\nAssumptions related to the treatment \nstrategies compared\n1.  The treatment strategies compared consist of a \nfinite number of treatments. In reality women \nwhose symptoms are not controlled to their \nsatisfaction could continue seeking treatment \nuntil they have what they consider adequate \ncontrol of their symptoms.\n2.  All women are initially given advice, if \nappropriate, about modifying their lifestyles.\n3.  If a woman becomes incontinent after \npreviously been cured, or after a treatment \nfailed, she would proceed to the next treatment \nin the strategy. Sensitivity analysis was \nperformed to explore the relaxation of this \nassumption.\n4.  In the cure model analysis women were \nassumed not to use containment products \nuntil they had exhausted all treatments in a \ntreatment strategy. Sensitivity analysis was \nperformed to explore the relaxation of this \nassumption.\n5.  In the improvement model all women were \nassumed to use containment products. \nThose women who were improved used less \ncontainment products than those who were not \nimproved. Sensitivity analysis was performed to \nexplore the relaxation of this assumption.\n6.  The probability of drug therapy being \nsuccessful after suffering an adverse event was \nassumed to be zero as we expected the woman \nto stop taking the drug when she suffered an \nadverse event.\nAssumptions relating to effectiveness\n1.  The median values of cure and improvement \nrates were used in the economic model, as the \ndata were highly skewed and the median was \nbelieved to provide a better representation of \nthe actual difference.\n2.  Long-term cure rates of all interventions were \nbased on extrapolation of available data.\n3.  When making an extrapolation from these \ndata, it was assumed, for drug therapy, that at \n12 months only 5.8% of those initially cured \nremain cured, which is equivalent to the \nspontaneous cure estimated for no treatment.\n4.  The estimates of cure and improvement rates \nfor all treatments were assigned log-normal or \nnormal distributions, based on the assumptions \nmade for the mixed-treatment model in \nChapter 8.\nAssumptions relating to costs\n1.  The difference between basic PFMT and PFMT \nwith extra sessions was based upon the number \nof sessions that a woman had per month.\n2.  The resources used in PFMT plus BF were \nbased on the assumption that the staff \nproviding the service was the same as those \nproviding PFMT and that the number of \nsessions were the same as those for PFMT.\n3.  The costs of VCs were based on the assumption \nthat the labour costs were one-third of those for \nPFMT (i.e. two visits with the physiotherapist).\n4.  The costs of exercise dairies and leaflets were \nconsidered to be negligible and it was also \nassumed that all patients would receive them. \nTherefore, their costs were not included.\n5.  All treatment costs were assigned log-normal \ndistributions, as this distribution appeared to \nbest fit the data that have skewed or symmetric \nranges.\nEstimation of model \nprobabilities\nThe main probabilities for the model are the cure \nrates, improvement rates and recurrence rates of \ndifferent interventions and mortality rates.\nRelative differences in cure and \nimprovement rates\nThe estimates of cure and improvement rates \nfor the interventions considered in the model \nare based on the results of the mixed-treatment \nmodel reported in Chapter 8.

The median values were used \nin the economic model, as the data were highly \nskewed and the median was believed to provide a \nbetter representation of the actual difference.\nAbsolute cure and improvement rates\nAs mentioned in Chapter 8, while the main \nparameters of the model are the log ORs of the \ntreatments, the absolute success rate for each \ntreatment can be calculated from the relative \nsuccess rates, if the absolute success rate for \none treatment is known. The absolute cure and \nimprovement rates were calculated in the model \nby combining the information on relative cure and \nimprovement rates described in Table 53, above, \nwith the absolute cure and improvement rates for \nno treatment which was taken to be the reference \ntreatment. The absolute cure rate at 3 months for \nno treatment was median 5.8% (95% CrI: 3.3% to \n9.9%) and the improvement rate at 3 months was \n26.3% (95% CrI: 15.7% to 40.5%) (Chapter 8).\nTransition probabilities\nRecurrence rates of PFMT\nDespite extensive searching, few data were \nidentified on the long-term effectiveness (greater \nthan 1 year) for any of the interventions. \nTherefore, estimates used in the model were based \non extrapolations of the available data.\nOnly four reports159,207\u2013209 provided long-term \nfollow-up of women who had received PFMT. One \nreport209 indicated that at 6 years no significant \ndifferences were found in urinary incontinence \nprevalence, severity or leakage episodes in the \nwomen who responded to the questionnaire \nbetween groups for PFMT with extra sessions \nand basic PFMT. However, this study was based \non postnatal women, whom we regarded as not \nbeing representative of women with SUI. A further \nthree reports published by other authors provided \noutcome data at 5 years207 and 15 years208 after \nreceiving PFMT were identified. One report208 \nlooked at two different intensities of pelvic floor \nmuscle exercises over a period of 15 years. Hence, \ndata from these three reports have been used in \nthe model, although the sample sizes were small. \nDetails of the values taken from these papers are \ndescribed in Table 54.\nExtrapolation of the long-term cure rates used \nin the model was generated from Kaplan\u2013Meier \nsurvival curves, using a linear exponential \ndistribution that manipulated by adjusting the two \nparameters (defined below). Using this process it \nis possible to estimate a hazard function using the \nvalues reported in Table 55.\nThe formula used to extrapolate the survival \nfunction [S(t)] is:\nS(t) = exp(\u2013(\u03bbt + \u03b3t2\/2))\n\u03bb = 0.001372, \u03b3 = 0.006308\nwhere:\n\u2022  S(t) is the probability of cure at any given time t\n\u2022  t is time (measured in terms of the number \nof cycles, where each cycle is equivalent to \n12 weeks)Assessment of cost-effectiveness\n114\nTABLE 54  Values used in the estimation of long-term recurrence rates of pelvic floor muscle traininga\nValues\nNumber of patients\nPFMT basic PFMT extra sessions\nRandomised 31 26\nAt 6 months 29 23\nAt 5 years NR 20\nAt 15 years 26 21\nSurgical interventions at 5 years 9 3 (3\/23)\nSurgical interventions at 15 years 4 8 (8\/21)\nPad test < 2 g (cure) at 5 years NR 6 (6\/20)\nNo visible leakage on stress pad test at 6 months NR 17 (17\/20)\nNo visible leakage on stress pad test at 5 years NR 15 (15\/20)\nDry on severity index at 15 years 4 (4\/25) 6 (6\/20)\na  PFMT follow-up rates (home vs intensive) \u2013 B\u00f8 and colleagues (1990);159 (1996);207 (2005).208\nTABLE 55  Values used in the estimation of long-term cure rate \nafter receiving pelvic floor muscle training\nTime \n(years)\nProbability of cure for:\nPFMT basic PFMT extra sessions\n0 1 1\n5 0.67a 0.75b\n15 0.16b 0.30b\na  Value based on Lagro-Janssen and van Weel (1998).210\nb  Value based on results of B\u00f8 and colleagues (2005).208\n\u2022  \u03bb is the scale parameter, which describes the \nprobability that a woman will remain\/become \nincontinent during the next time period, given \nthat she was continent in the current period\n\u2022  \u03b3 is the shape parameter, which, in simple \nterms, describes the rate of change in \nthe probability that a woman will become \nincontinent over time.\nAppendix 25 described how the transition \nprobabilities (i.e. the chance or remaining cured \nor suffering a recurrence of symptoms) were \ncalculated using the above formula. Figure 36 shows \nthe shape of the linear exponential curve that was \nfitted to the data reported in Table 55.\nRecurrence rates for other physical \ntherapies\nThe recurrence rate for physical therapies was \ngenerated by multiplying the failure of PFMT \nby the relative effect sizes derived in the MTC \nreported in Chapter 8 and summarised in Table 50.\nRecurrence rates for drug (SNRI) \ntherapy\nAs with the PFMT, there were very few studies that \nhad long-term follow-up of women who were using \ndrugs to treat their incontinence. Four relevant \nstudies were identified as part of the systematic \nreview studies57,136\u2013138 and an unpublished study \nfrom Eli Lilly and Company.211 These studies had \nan unclear length of follow-up, a follow-up of \nless than 1 year or were unpublished. One study \nwas identified that reported recurrence rates for \na cohort of women at different time points after \nthe initiation of drug treatment.212 In making \nan extrapolation from these data it was assumed \nthat at 12 months only 5.8% of those initially \ncured remain cured, which is equivalent to the \nspontaneous cure estimated for no treatment. This \nrate is lower than the 9% cure rate reported by \nVella and colleagues.212\nExtrapolation of cure rate (disease free) was \nestimated from a Kaplan\u2013Meier curve using a \nWeibull survival model from the data reported in \nTable 56. The Weibull distribution was chosen for \nthis extrapolation as it was felt to have a suitable \nfunctional form to estimate a survival. The Weibull \ndistribution is defined by two parameters: the \nscale parameter (\u03bb) and the shape parameter (\u03b3). \nThe scale parameter describes the probability that \nthe woman becomes incontinent during the next \ntime period, given that she is continent during \nthe current time period. The shape parameter \ndescribes the hazard function of Weibull function \nfor the survival time. The hazard function for \nWeibull survival time could be increasing or DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The likelihood that a woman might die was \nbased upon the annual rates of age-specific all-\ncause mortality for women [based on the Office \nfor National Statistics (ONS) interim life tables \n2004\u201306 (database on the Internet)].217 Figure 39 \nshows the survival curve for females for the UK and \nAppendix 25 reports the rates of all-cause mortality \nused in the model.\nResource utilisation and cost \nestimation\nResource use data was identified from existing \nstudies,43 relevant literature (e.g. reports from \nmanufacturers) and advice from experts in this \nfield. The resources used to provide the non-\nsurgical interventions included:\n\u2022  the number of visits to the practitioners for the \nsessions of therapy\n\u2022  the staff time, the appropriate grade and \ndirect overheads associated with delivering \nhealth care, such as clerical support and \nadministration of the sessions of therapy\n\u2022  the consumables required to provide service\n\u2022  the reusable equipment used.\nThe costs of exercise dairies and leaflets were \nconsidered to be negligible and it was also assumed \nthat all patients would receive them. Therefore, \ntheir costs were not included.\nLifestyle changes\nThe cost of lifestyle changes were based on the cost \nof a single visit to the GP.\nPFMT basic\nAs indicated in the recent NICE guidance,43 it \nwas assumed that PFMT comprised six sessions. \nAs acknowledged in the guidance, it is difficult \nto define a \u2018standard\u2019 or \u2018typical\u2019 PFMT session, \nand, hence, in reality, costs will vary according to \nthe actual care provided. Within the model it was \nassumed that the first session of PFMT would last \nfor 1 hour and the other five sessions would last for \n30 minutes each. Each session would be conducted \nby a senior grade 1 women\u2019s health physiotherapist \nin a hospital physiotherapy department. The \nconsumables that would be required per session \nwould be: gloves, KY Jelly, wipes and paper towels.Assessment of cost-effectiveness\n118\nTABLE 58  Other parameters used in the economic model\nProbability Value Source\nProbability of adverse event while on drug therapy 0.45 Estimated from \nsystematic reviewa\nProbability that women who failed PFMT, or for whom symptoms recurred, managed \ntheir symptoms thereafter with containment products\n0 Assumption\nProbability of continuing to use containment products after PFMT has failed or \nsymptoms have recurred\n0 Assumption\nProbability that women who failed PFMT + adjunct, or for whom symptoms recurred, \nmanaged their symptoms thereafter with containment products\n0 Assumption\nProbability of continuing to use containment products after PFMT + adjunct has failed \nor symptoms have recurred\n0 Assumption\nProbability that women who failed PFMT, etc., or for whom symptoms recurred, \nmanaged their symptoms thereafter with containment products\n0 Assumption\nProbability of continuing to use containment management after PFMT, etc. has failed \nor symptoms have recurred\n0 Assumption\nProbability that women who failed with drugs, or for whom symptoms recurred, \nmanaged their symptoms thereafter with containment products\n0 Assumption\nProbability of continuing to use containment products after drugs have failed or \nsymptoms have recurred\n0 Assumption\nProbability that women who failed following surgery, or for whom symptoms \nrecurred, managed their symptoms thereafter with containment products\n0 Assumption\nProbability of continuing to use containment products after surgery has failed or \nsymptoms have recurred\n0 Assumption\nProbability of the first surgery being successful 0.87 Estimated in the \nmodel\nProbability of a second surgery being successful 0.85 Estimated in the \nmodel\nProbability of drug therapy being successful after suffering an adverse event 0 Urinary incontinence \nguideline, 200643\nMortality rates of surgery 0.0005 Cody 200380\na  See Chapter 7.\nPFMT with extra sessions\nThe costs of PFMT with extra sessions were derived \nin the same way as those of basic PFMT described \nabove, but the number of sessions was increased \nfrom six to 12.\nPFMT plus BF\nThe resources used for PFMT plus BF were based \non the assumption that the staff providing the \nservice was the same as those providing PFMT \nalone, and that the number of sessions were the \nsame as those for PFMT. Additional resources \nrequired for the BF were the equipment used, \nfor example the hand-held single-channel EMG \nchannel, the Neen Educator\uf8e8 and Neen Periform \nvaginal probe. The educators and the probes were \ntreated as consumables, as they were used by only \none woman over all of the sessions. However, \nthe NeuroTrac device\u2122 was loaned to women \nfor 3 months. Based upon information from \nmanufacturers and from NHS users, this piece \nof equipment was considered to have a lifespan \nof 5 years, the equivalent annual cost of the \nequipment was calculated (using a 3.5% discount \nrate as recommended by the UK Treasury) and \nthe cost per woman took into account that the \nequipment was used by four women per year. These \ndata were used to help interpret the results of \n\u2018PFMT with extra sessions\u2019 only when it was used \nin the model. This is because the effectiveness of \nPFMT with extra sessions was similar to PFMT plus \nBF, and it is plausible that the costs of the two types \nof therapy were similar.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Cones are often bought over the counter \nafter GP advice. The cost of VCs was based on \nthe assumption that the labour costs were one-\nthird of those for PFMT (i.e. two visits with the \nphysiotherapist). Although VCs are not currently \nprovided by the NHS, the women using VCs would \nstill have two visits with the physiotherapist. The \nconsumables required and consumables used were \ncones, gloves, paper towels and KY Jelly.\nElectrical stimulation\nElectrical stimulation can be provided either at \nhome or in a clinic. The difference between the \ntwo ways of providing the therapy relates to the \nnumber of sessions that the woman receives. \nHome-based ES has three sessions, whereas the \nclinic-based therapy has 13 sessions (although this \nmay vary in practice), with the first session lasting \n1 hour and the remainder lasting 30 minutes. For \nthe home-based ES, the woman has a 1-hour-long \nsession in the hospital physiotherapy department \nto determine an appropriate programme and \nthen two follow-up sessions. The Neen Pericalm \ndevice is loaned to women for home use for \n3 months. In this analysis it was assumed that 13 \nsessions would be provided by a physiotherapist \nin a hospital department. The resources used \nincluded a Neen Periform vaginal electrode and \ndata-reading clinical equipment, along with the \nsame consumables that were used in the provision \nof PFMT (gloves, KY Jelly, couch roll, wipes and \npaper towels). Based upon information from \nmanufacturers and from NHS users, the equipment \nwas assumed to have a lifespan of 5 years and \nan equivalent annual cost of the equipment \nwas calculated (using a 3.5% discount rate as \nrecommended by the UK Treasury). A total of \n200 women would be able to use it each year in a \nclinical setting.\nMedical therapy\nThe cost of drug treatment was based on two \nconsultations (an initial consultation and a review \nconsultation) with the GP, and the drug costs for \neach cycle (3 months).\nSurgical interventions\nSurgical costs were based on the average costs of \nan elective minor lower urinary tract procedure \nwithout complications.54\nContainment products\nThe costs of containment products (such as \ndisposable insert and menstrual pads, and \nwashable pants with and without insert pads) were \nbased on information reported in a systematic \nreview of containment products.84 The cost of other \ncontainment products, such as urethral plugs, were \nnot included in the base analysis.Assessment of cost-effectiveness\n120\nCost estimation\nAs described above, costs focused on the direct \nhealth service costs that were associated with each \ntreatment. Unit cost data were extracted from \nthe literature or from relevant sources, such as \nmanufacturer price lists and NHS reference costs. \nThe year of the cost data is 2008 and the currency \nis pounds sterling (\u00a3). Table 59 provides a summary \nof the costs for each intervention.\nQuality of life\nSummary of a structured review of \nreports on health-state utilities\nThe primary outcome for the economic analysis \nwas QALYs. The QALY estimates within the model \nanalysis are mainly determined by whether a \nwoman was continent or not, as the risk of death \nfrom SUI or any of the treatment options is very \nlow. Although there is considerable evidence about \nthe quality of life of women with SUI, this tends \nto be measured using condition-specific tools, \nsuch as the I-QoL. Such data are not ideal for \nincorporation into an economic evaluation. As an \neconomic evaluation seeks to inform choices about \nhow best to allocate society\u2019s scarce resources, it \nhas been argued that changes in quality of life \nshould reflect society\u2019s valuation. One quality-of-life \ninstrument that has a scoring system based on the \npreferences of the UK population is the EQ-5D. \nThis method is the approach preferred by NICE105 \nin HTAs, although there may be some concerns \nthat it is not sufficiently sensitive to changes in the \nsymptoms of incontinence.\nEstimates of the EQ-5D scores for a sample of \nwomen suffering from SUI were reported in \nChapter 4. Further data were identified from \nthe literature search that was performed for the \neffectiveness review and these were supplemented \nby information from NHS Economic Evaluation \nDatabase (EED) and the Cost-Effectiveness \nAnalysis (CEA) Registry at Tufts Medical Center.218 \nFrom this search, only three published studies \nTABLE 59  Cost of each intervention\nIntervention Cost per cycle (\u00a3)a Range (\u00a3) Notes and comments\nLifestyle changes\nCost per visit 27 13\u201340 Range based on 1 or 3 visits to GP (Curtis 2008)46\nPFMT\nPFMT basic 189 135\u2013243 Range based on 4 and 8 sessions\nPFMT + BF 224 175\u2013388 Range based on 4 and 8 sessions\nES 398 206\u2013481 Range based on 8 and 16 sessions\nVCs 93 83\u2013103 Assumed provided at the hospital\nPFMT extra sessions 351 243\u2013459 Based on 8 and 16 sessions\nDrug therapy (SNRI)\nAppointments and drugs \nfor 12 weeks\n164 128\u2013200 Initial cost based on 2 appointments (initial and \nreview) and the range is based on 1 or 3 visits to \nGP\nSurgical therapy\nTVT\/TVT-O 1135 741\u20131357 Based on lower and upper interquartile range \nof reference costs (2008) for elective surgery \non lower-tract minor procedures without \ncomplications\nColposuspension 1396 1002\u20131618 Range estimation based on TVT range\nContainment products\nWashable inserts 39 9\u201375 Initial cost based on cost per month for washable \ninsert pants; range based on the minimum \n(menstrual pads) and maximum (disposable insert \npants) cost of containment\na  Log-normal probability distribution was attached to all these costs.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The mean score for women in the UK was \n0.73 and the median 0.85.221 Another study on the \nsame population of women reported 0.76 as the \nadjusted OR for EQ-5D health-state index score.222\nHaywood and colleagues219 reported EQ-5D scores \nfor women based on the number of incontinence \nepisodes at baseline. Those with no episodes has a \nmean score of 0.85 (SD 0.24). When incontinence \nwas suffered on a few days the mean score was 0.85 \n(SD 0.16). As would be anticipated, the mean score \ndeclined as severity of incontinence increased. \nFor example, when incontinence was suffered for \n\u2018about half the week\u2019 the mean score was 0.81 \n(SD 0.20); for \u2018most days\u2019 the mean score was \n0.79 (SD 0.23) and for \u2018everyday\u2019 the mean score \nwas 0.75 (SD 0.32).219 This study219 also reported \nEQ-5D scores based upon the perceived benefit \nfrom physiotherapy at 6 weeks and 5 months. At \n6 weeks the mean score from those who said they \nhad benefited was 0.85 (SD 0.23) and for those who \nsaid that they had no benefit was 0.73 (SD 0.31). At \n5 months the mean scores were 0.85 (SD 0.24) and \n0.74 (SD 0.38) for those who said they did and did \nnot benefit from physiotherapy, respectively.\nThe third study published on women who were \nreceiving surgery for SUI reported quality of life \nat baseline and at trial follow-up.220 These data \nwere subsequently manipulated in an HTA trial \ncomparing different surgical treatments.80 The \nEQ-5D score for women prior to surgery was 0.778 \nfor women randomised to TVT, and 0.785 for \nwomen randomised to colposuspension.220 Finally, \nas reported in Chapter 4, the survey of members of \nInContact previously identified as suffering from \nSUI reported a mean EQ-5D score of 0.598 (SD \n0.339). The mean age for the women involved in \nthis sample was 57 years (range 28\u201389).\nDerivation of values used in the model\nIt was thought possible that the women involved in \nthe survey reported in Chapter 4 might be atypical \nof the average woman with SUI, as they were part \nof a self-selected patient group. Therefore, in \nthe economic model the utility score was based \non the study by Manca and colleagues,220 and \nfailure after treatment was based on the study by \nHaywood and colleagues.219 This value was that \nof women who perceived that they did not benefit \nfrom physiotherapy treatment, thus indicating \nthat it had failed. The utility assigned to successful \ntreatment was taken as 0.85. This value was based \non the women who perceived that they benefited \nfrom physiotherapy treatment at 6 months after \ntreatment (Table 60).\nData analysis\nCost\u2013utility analysis\nAs women with SUI might be either cured or \n\u2018cured or improved\u2019 (i.e. not requiring further \ntreatment but possibly still having some degree \nof incontinence), two separate analyses were \nconducted. One analysis was based upon the \nreported cure rates (see Cost\u2013utility analysis based \nupon cure rates, below) and a second analysis based \nupon improvement rates (see Results based upon \nimprovement rates, below).\nThe estimation of the costs and consequences \nof the different management strategies was \nperformed using a hypothetical cohort of 1000 \nwomen, starting at age of 45 years (the identified \nprevalence average age of women with SUI in \nChapter 1) over a 40-year horizon. Results are \npresented as incremental cost per QALY. These are \nratios of the differences in costs of the interventions \ndivided by the differences in effectiveness between \nthe different strategies. These data show the rate of \nreturn (in QALYs) to the quantity of resources used \n(measured in monetary terms). If for any given Assessment of cost-effectiveness\n122\nincremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) it is \njudged that a treatment is efficient then it implies \nthat society is willing to pay at least that amount \nto obtain an additional QALY. The value society is \nwilling to pay for a QALY is unclear, but, typically, \nNICE, within the UK, recommends interventions \nwhen the incremental cost per QALY is less than \n\u00a320,000\u201330,000.105\nSensitivity analyses\nWith all parameter estimates there are elements \nof uncertainty owing to the lack of available \ninformation. In order to explore the importance \nof such uncertainties and assumptions, various \nsensitivity analyses were conducted by varying \nsome of the assumptions or parameters made in \nthe model. Two types of sensitivity analyses were \nperformed: a probabilistic sensitivity analysis and a \ndeterministic sensitivity analysis.\nProbabilistic sensitivity analysis\nOne area of uncertainty within the economic model \nis precision of the parameter estimates used. Many \nof the parameters are not precisely known but the \nuncertainty surrounding a point estimate can be \ndescribed using a statistical distribution. Probability \ndistributions were applied to the specific ranges \nof the key parameters (Table 61), such as costs and \nsamples drawn at random from these distributions \nto generate an empirical distribution of the \ncost-effectiveness ratios. All treatment costs \nwere assigned log-normal distributions, as this \ndistribution appeared to best fit the data that \nhave skewed or symmetric ranges. There was \nno distribution to be assigned for probabilities \nof recurrence of all treatment (PFMT, drug and \nTVT surgery) due to the paucity of data. There \nwas also no distribution to all-cause mortality rate \nas the number of observation used to calculate \nthe risk was very large. The estimates of cure and \nimprovement rates for all treatments were assigned \nlog-normal or normal distributions based on the \nassumptions made in the mixed-treatment model \nin Chapter 8.\nDeterministic sensitivity analysis\nThe second type of analysis undertaken to handle \nparameter uncertainty was to consider changes in \none or more parameter value at the same time. \nThis was used to explore structural uncertainty, \nextrapolations, methodological uncertainty, etc. \nThis deterministic sensitivity analysis had been \ncombined with probabilistic sensitivity analysis \nso that the joint effect of using different values \n(and distributions) and statistical imprecision \nsurrounding estimates is explored. Outlined below \nare the details of the specific sensitivity analyses \nperformed.\nRecurrence rates of PFMT\nAs there were limited data relating to the long-term \nfollow-up of PFMT, the long-term recurrence rates \nof PFMT in the base-case analysis were produced \nbased on the values at 5 years210 and 15 years.208 \nHowever, the identified data at 15 years in the \nstudy by B\u00f8 and colleagues208 was varied as in Table \n55. Changes to the recurrence rates of PFMT are \nlikely to alter cost-effectiveness of the strategies \nrelated to PFMT. Figure 40 describes the alternative \nlong-term recurrence rates considered in the \nsensitivity analysis.\nAs described in the section Estimation of model \nprobabilities, data on the long-term effectiveness of \nall physical interventions were not readily available. \nIn the base-case model it was assumed that the \nrecurrence rates for physical therapies could be \nderived by multiplying the recurrence of PFMT \nby the relative effect sizes derived in the MTC, \nreported in Chapter 8 and summarised in Table \n50. The recurrence rates for PFMT came from B\u00f8 \nand colleagues.208 B\u00f8 and colleagues208 reported \nthat there was no difference at 15 years in the \neffectiveness of the two forms of PFMT compared. \nTherefore, in this sensitivity analysis it was assumed \nthat the recurrence rates for all different physical \ntreatments (PFMT plus BF, VCs and ES) had the \nsame recurrence rate as PFMT.\nRecurrence rates of TVT\nAs explained in Estimation of model probabilities, \nthere was no reliable evidence related to the long-\nterm follow-up of recurrence rate of TVT surgery. \nThe trial by Ward and colleagues,213 which reported \nrecurrence rates for up to 5 years\u2019 follow-up, was \nused to estimate the recurrence rates of TVT \nsurgery in the base-case analysis. This sensitivity \nanalysis used the recurrence rates estimated in an \nearlier HTA that compared TVT surgery with other \nsurgical treatments.80 In the sensitivity analysis \nthe long-term cure rates for TVT surgery were \nincreased to 81% and reduced to 65% in the first \nyear and 61% in the second year.\nStarting age and time horizon\nThe incidence rate of SUI is likely to increase as \nage increases. The mean age of women with SUI in \nthe UK is 45 years and this was taken to be the age \nof women in the cohort modelled. Women included \nin the trials included in the systematic review \nof effectiveness tended to be slightly older, with DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

This time horizon was chosen \nas it was felt to cover the expected life expectancy \nof women aged 45.

Therefore, the starting age of \nwomen was changed to 50, 55, and 60 years in the \nsensitivity analyses. The time horizons were likewise \nreduced to 10, 20 and 30 years.\nQuality of life\nAs mentioned previously (see Quality of life), data \nfrom Manca and colleagues220 and Haywood and \ncolleagues219 were used in the base-case analysis. \nSensitivity analysis was performed using the EQ-5D \nscores derived in the survey reported in Chapter 4 \nto weight the utility scores taken from the study by \nHaywood and colleagues219 (Table 61).\nThe impact of the natural decline in quality of life \nover time was also considered in further sensitivity \nanalysis. The values for the age-related reduction \nwas derived based on published values for age-\nrelated quality of life.223 The extrapolated values \nare illustrated in Figure 41 and Appendix 25.\nDiscount rate\nAs recommended in the NICE guidelines, an \nannual discount rate of 3.5% for costs and benefits \nwas used in the base-case analyses.105 A range of \n1\u20136% for discount rate was considered in this \nsensitivity analysis.\nProbability of moving to the next \ntreatment following failure of prior \ntreatment\nConsiderable efforts were made to identify the \nestimates for a probability that women would \nnot seek further treatment should a treatment \nfail or symptoms recur, and would manage their \nincontinence using containment products, but few \ndata are available. In the base-case analyses it was \nassumed that the women would go immediately \nto the next treatment after failure or recurrence. \nIn this sensitivity analysis, the impact of allowing \nbetween 10% and 50% of women who experience a \ntreatment failure or recurrence of symptoms not to \nseek further treatment was explored.\nUse of containment products\nAlthough there is anecdotal evidence that women \nuse containment even when they are undergoing \ntreatment, there were no data to inform what \nproportion of the women use containment products Assessment of cost-effectiveness\n124\nTABLE 61  EQ-5D values weighted by the utilities reported in Chapter 4\nEQ-5D score Value Source\nThe baseline of SUI (pretreatment) 0.60 Chapter 4\nThe failure of treatment 0.57 Haywood and colleagues (2008),219 weighted by utilities reported in \nChapter 4\nThe success of treatment 0.65 Haywood and colleagues (2008),219 weighted by utilities reported in \nChapter 4\nand what type of products they use. Therefore, in \nthe cure and improvement model it was assumed \nall women used containment products, although \nthe quantity\/type used varied according to \nsymptoms. \nMortality and success rate of TVT\nFurther sensitivity analyses were conducted by \nvarying the mortality risk and success rates related \nto TVT in base case. In the base-case analysis a \nmortality risk based on the risk of undergoing \nopen surgery (0.0005) was attached to TVT. In \nthe sensitivity analysis this was reduced to zero. \nSensitivity analysis was also performed to estimate \nthe impact of an increase in the success rate of TVT \nby 5%.\nCosts\nAs indicated earlier, it is difficult to define a \n\u2018standard\u2019 intervention, as practice varies greatly. \nThe costs of interventions are dependent on the \nassumptions made about the number of sessions \nof therapy a woman could get. Maximum and \nminimum costs were derived by increasing and \nreducing the number of sessions. For example, \nthe minimum cost of basic PFMT was derived \nby reducing the number of sessions to four and \nthe maximum cost was derived by increasing the \nnumber of sessions to eight. Distributions were \nused in the analysis to incorporate the minimum \nand maximum values attached to the costs.\nResults of the model \npresented in terms of costs \nand consequences\nThe results of the base-case deterministic analyses \nfor 1000 women are presented in terms of \nsummaries of the time spent cured (or improved \nfor the improvement model), with incontinence \nand also the cumulative number of women \nwho have received surgery. The results are also \npresented in terms of the cumulative QALYs and \ncost.\nAnalysis based on cure rates\nFor the analyses based on the cure rates, the \nstrategy that used lifestyle changes and PFMT \nbasic followed by PFMT with extra sessions \nfollowed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013PFMT \nextra sessions\u2013TVT) had the best performance \nin terms of the highest number of successes (939 \nand 953) and lowest number of failures (59 and \n36) at the 1- and 10-year time horizons, whereas \nthe strategy that used lifestyle changes and PFMT \nbasic followed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PMT basic\u2013\nTVT) had the highest number of success at the \n40-year time horizon (398). The strategy that \nhad the least number of failures (28) was the one \nthat used the lifestyle changes and PFMT basic \nfollowed by PFMT with extra sessions followed by \nSNRI followed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013\nPFMT extra sessions\u2013SNRI\u2013TVT). The strategy \nof lifestyle change and TVT surgery (LS\u2013TVT) \nhas the worst performance in terms of the lowest \nnumber of successes (726, 907 and 363) and the \nhighest number of failures (272, 82 and 57) at \nall three time horizons. This strategy had the \nhighest number of patients (998 and 989) receiving \nsurgery at 1- and 10-year time horizons, and the \nstrategy that used lifestyle changes and PFMT basic \nfollowed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013TVT) \nhad the highest number (443) of patients receiving \nsurgery at the 40-year time horizon (Table 62).\nAnalysis based on improvement \nrates\nFor the analysis based on improvement rates, the \nstrategy that used LS\u2013PFMT with extra sessions \nfollowed by TVT surgery had the best performance \nin terms of the highest number of successes (985, \n951 and 410) at all the three time horizons and \nthe lowest number of failures (13 and 22) at 1 \nand 10 years (Table 63).

This strategy also had the highest \nnumber of patients (998, 973 and 422) having had \nsurgery at all three time horizons.\nCost\u2013utility analysis based \nupon cure rates\nDeterministic results\nTable 64 details the results of the mean cost and \ntreatment effects of the model using cure rates \nfrom the mixed-treatment model in a hypothetical \ncohort with 1000 samples. The table reports \nperformance of the strategies from the least to the \nmost costly. The lower part of the table reports \nthe ICERs when dominated and extendedly \ndominated strategies are omitted. The strategy \nthat used lifestyle changes and PFMT with extra \nsessions followed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT extra \nsessions\u2013TVT) was the least costly (\u00a31644) and the \nmost effective (16.20 QALYs). The strategy that \nhad lifestyle changes followed by TVT surgery \n(LS\u2013TVT) was the most costly (\u00a31973), and the \nstrategy that used lifestyle changes and PFMT basic \nfollowed by PFMT with extra sessions followed by \nSNRI and then TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013\nPFMT extra sessions\u2013SNRI\u2013TVT) was the least \neffective (15.89 QALYs).\nProbabilistic results\nAs the cost-effectiveness point estimates do \nnot provide any information of uncertainty \nsurrounding the model parameters, probabilistic \nsensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations \nwas also performed using these strategies. The \nresults of the probabilistic analysis are presented in \nthe form of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves in \nFigure 42. The strategy employing lifestyle changes \nand PFMT with extra sessions followed by TVT \nsurgery (LS-PFMT extra sessions-TVT) has a more \nthan 70% probability of being considered cost-\neffective for all threshold values for willingness to \npay for a QALY presented.

The results of this analysis are shown in \nAppendices 26\u201327.\nChanges to the structure of the model\nProbability of containment after \nfailure or recurrence for non-surgical \ntreatment\nThe likelihood that the strategies would be \nconsidered cost-effective in cure rate base case \ndid not largely change, although the costs for the \nstrategy associated with no surgical treatments \nwere increased, and the outcomes (QALYs) were \ndecreased when the proportion of women using \ncontainment products increased (Table 70).\nProbability of containment after \nfailure or recurrence for first surgical \ntreatment\nFor the model based on cure rates, the likelihood \nthat the different strategies would be considered \ncost-effective did not change when the probability \nof using containment products after failure or \nrecurrence was applied, although costs for each \ngiven strategy increased and the outcomes (QALYs) \ndecreased when the proportion of women using \ncontainment products increased (Table 71).\nAdding strategies that use VCs and ES\nAs indicated in Model framework, strategies using \nVC and ES were to be considered in sensitivity \nanalyses. The results of the deterministic analysis \nare reported in Table 72. The strategy that \nemployed lifestyle changes and PFMT basic \nfollowed by ES followed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT \nbasic\u2013ES\u2013TVT) was dominated (more costly and \nless effective than another strategy). The strategy \nthat employed lifestyle changes and PFMT \nbasic followed by VCs followed by TVT surgery \n(LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013VC\u2013TVT) was dominated. The \naddition of strategies involving VCs and ES had a \nsmall probability of being considered cost-effective \n(less than 12%) and did not greatly influence the \nresults.\nOther sensitivity analyses\nChanges to starting ages, time horizon, quality of \nlife and discount rates all had no substantial effect \non the results. As the starting age was increased \nthe costs and outcomes for each strategy were \nreduced because of the increase in mortality as age \nincreased. As the time horizon reduced there was \nless opportunity for women who had undergone \nthe relatively costly surgery to accrue much \nbenefit. Reducing the discount rate meant that \nthe sustained benefits of surgery were given more \nweight in the analysis as were the costs of using \ncontainment products. Therefore, the LS\u2013TVT \nstrategy increased in its likelihood of being cost-\neffective. The results of these sensitivity analyses \nare reported in Appendix 26.\nResults based upon \nimprovement rates\nDeterministic results\nIn these analyses the costs were lower and the \nQALYs were higher than those reported in analyses \nbased on cure rates (Table 73). The strategy that \nused lifestyle changes and PFMT basic followed by \nPFMT with extra sessions followed by TVT surgery \n(LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013TVT) was \nthe least costly (\u00a31795) and the strategy that had \nlifestyle and PFMT with extra sessions followed by \nTVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013TVT) was \nthe most effective (16.37 QALYs). The strategy \nthat had lifestyle changes followed by TVT surgery \n(LS\u2013TVT) was the most costly (\u00a32425) and the least \neffective (16.2 QALYs).\nProbabilistic results\nProbabilistic analysis was performed comparing \nall these strategies. As illustrated in Figure 43, the \nstrategy that used lifestyle and PFMT with extra \nsessions followed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT extra \nsessions\u2013TVT) has more than a 50% probability \nof being considered cost-effective when society\u2019s \nwillingness to pay for an additional QALY is more \nthan \u00a310,000. The other strategies have a less than \n20% chance of being considered cost-effective, as \nsociety\u2019s willingness to pay more for additional \nQALYs increases. The strategy that had the least \nprobability of being considered cost-effective was \nthe one that used lifestyle changes followed by TVT \nsurgery.\nSensitivity analyses\nChanges to the effectiveness and cost of \nPFMT basic and PFMT extra sessions\nChange in the long-term recurrence \nrates of PFMT basic and PFMT extra \nsessions\nWhen the long-term cure rates of PFMT with extra \nsessions were the same as PFMT basic, then the \nstrategy that had the highest probability of being \ncost-effective changed from lifestyle and PFMT Assessment of cost-effectiveness\n136\nDOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Similarly, reducing the cure rates \nof both PFMT basic and PFMT with extra sessions \nalso meant that lifestyle and PFMT basic followed \nby TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013TVT) was most \nlikely to be cost-effective.\nChanges to the ORs of PFMT basic and \nPFMT extra sessions compared with no \ntreatment\nThe results of the sensitivity analysis performed \nusing different point estimates in clinical \neffectiveness for improvement rates of PFMT \nextra sessions and PFMT basic are reported \nin Table 75. When the OR of PFMT with extra \nsessions compared with no treatment falls, \nstrategies involving this treatment are less likely \nto be considered cost-effective. The strategy that \nincreased more in terms of the likelihood of being \ncost-effective was lifestyle changes and PFMT basic \nfollowed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013TVT).\nChanges to the cost of PFMT with extra \nsessions\nAs indicated in Resource utilisation and cost \nestimation, the cost of PFMT with extra sessions \nmay be underestimated. When the cost of PFMT \nwith extra sessions increases, the strategies \ncontaining this treatment became less likely to \nbe considered cost-effective (Table 76). When the \ncost of PFMT increased beyond \u00a3200 there was an \nincreasing chance that lifestyle changes and PFMT \nbasic followed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013\nTVT) would be considered cost-effective.\nChanges to the effectiveness of surgery\nChange in the recurrence rates of TVT\nAs indicated in Estimation of model probabilities, \nthe long-term recurrence rates of incontinence \nafter TVT surgery were estimated from the trial by \nWard and colleagues.213 There is some uncertainty \nattached to this estimate and it is probable that this \nvalue could be either an over- or underestimate. \nAs long-term cure rates of TVT surgery decreased, \nthe costs associated with long-term TVT surgery \nfor each strategy were increased because the long-\nterm recurrence of TVT surgery was also increased \nleading to a decrease in long-term benefits. Table \n77 describes the results of the sensitivity analyses \nfor changes in the long-term cure rates for TVT \nsurgery. When the probability was increased to \n81%, the likelihood that lifestyle changes and \nPFMT with extra sessions followed by TVT (LS\u2013\nPFMT extra sessions\u2013TVT) was cost-effective fell \nto approximately 60%. The main gainer was the \nstrategy of lifestyle changes followed by TVT (LS\u2013\nTVT), which had a 30% chance of being considered \ncost-effective over the range of values considered. \nWhen the probability was reduced to 65%, the \nlikelihood that the strategy lifestyle changes \nand PFMT with extra sessions followed by TVT \n(LS\u2013PFMT extra sessions-TVT) was considered to \nbe cost-effective is increased to 80% and that of \nlifestyle changes followed by TVT is reduced to 1% \n(Table 78).\nMortality and success rate of TVT\nThe results did not change to any extent when the \nmortality risk was reduced to zero or the success \nrate of TVT was increased to 5%.

As the starting age was increased, \nthe costs and outcomes for each strategy were \nreduced because of the increase in mortality as \nage increased.

The results of these \nsensitivity analyses are reported in Appendix 27.\nSummary of results\nThe economic model presented in this chapter \nconsidered some of the management strategies \nthat have the potential to be, or are currently \nbeing, used in managing women with SUI.

It was therefore \nassumed in the model that all women have \nreceived lifestyle change advice in each strategy \nand then go to the next treatment. There were no \nreliable data on the long-term clinical effectiveness \nof PFMT, drug therapy and TVT surgery. \nLong-term recurrence rates for PFMT, drug \ntherapy and TVT were estimated by parametric \nextrapolation methods of the limited evidence \nbase. Furthermore, there was also no information \nassociated with long-term clinical effectiveness of \nother non-surgical treatments.\nThe cost\u2013utility analyses were conducted using \nEQ-5D scores to value health effects in the two \nbase-case analyses. Broadly speaking, the results \nthat were based on cure rates were similar to those \nbased on improvement rates.\nIn the cure-rate base-case analysis there was only \none non-dominated or non-extendedly dominated \nstrategy (i.e. it provided more benefits than a less \ncostly strategy or more benefits than could be \nprovided should a combination of a less and more \ncostly strategies be used):\n\u2022  lifestyle changes and PFMT with extra sessions \nfollowed by TVT (LS\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013\nTVT).\nIn the analysis based on improvement rates there \nwere two strategies that were not dominated or \nextendedly dominated:\n\u2022  lifestyle changes and PFMT with extra sessions \nfollowed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT extra \nsessions\u2013TVT) and\n\u2022  lifestyle changes and PFMT basic followed by \nPFMT with extra sessions then TVT surgery \n(LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013TVT).\nFor the cure-rate base-case analysis, the strategy \n\u2018lifestyle changes and PFMT extra session followed \nby TVT (LS\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013TVT)\u2019 was the \nleast costly (\u00a31644) and the most effective (16.20 \nQALYs) strategy. For the improvement-rate base-\ncase analysis, the strategy \u2018lifestyle changes and \nPFMT basic followed by PFMT with extra sessions \nfollowed by TVT surgery (LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013PFMT \nextra sessions\u2013TVT)\u2019 was the least costly (\u00a31795) \nand provided 16.31 QALYs. For both base-case \nanalyses the strategy of \u2018lifestyle changes followed \nby TVT surgery (LS\u2013TVT)\u2019 (mean cost = \u00a31793 for \ncure rates and \u00a32524 for improvement rates) was \nthe most costly.\nIn the cure-rate base case, the strategy of \u2018lifestyle \nchanges and PFMT basic followed by PFMT \nwith extra sessions followed by SNRI and then \nTVT surgery\u2019 was the least effective (providing \n15.89 QALYs) strategy. In the improvement-rate \nbase-case analysis the strategy that used \u2018lifestyle \nchanges followed by TVT surgery\u2019 was the least \neffective.\nAlthough the differences between strategies in \nterms of costs and effects in both base-case analyses \nappear not to be large, the important issue is \nwhether society is willing to pay for any additional \ngain. Only two strategies have a likelihood of \nbeing considered to be cost-effective of greater \nthan 50% when the threshold is \u00a320,000\u201330,000 \nper QALY: LS\u2013PFMT extra session\u2013TVT (cure \nrates) and LS\u2013PFMT basic\u2013PFMT extra sessions\u2013\nTVT(improvement rates). All of the other strategies \nhad between 0% and 20% likelihood of being \nconsidered cost-effective if society were willing to \npay between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 per QALY.\nResults of probabilistic sensitivity analyses, \nperformed to handle the uncertainty around the \nparameter estimates used within the model, were \nbroadly consistent with the point estimates for both \nbase-case analyses. The likelihood that different \nstrategies might be considered cost-effective \nchanged slightly in some sensitivity analyses. The \nresults of the model were sensitive to changes in \nthe long-term cure rates. However, these changes \ndid not alter the conclusions.\nThe results of the sensitivity analyses were broadly \nsimilar to those of the base cases when different \nvalues of quality of life were used to estimate \nQALYs and when other assumptions made within \nthe model were changed. For example, when the \nproportion of patients that used containment \nproducts after failure or recurrence for non-surgical \nor surgical treatments were changed.\nThe modelling performed in this section provided \nand contributed to the evidence available for \nevaluating the cost-effectiveness of non-surgical \ninterventions for the treatment of SUI in women. \nThis work also provided information on the long-\nterm costs of managing women with SUI.\nThe data that were used to estimate cost-\neffectiveness came from the MTC model. These \ndata represented the best available evidence to date Assessment of cost-effectiveness\n154\non the relative effectiveness of the non-surgical \ntreatments.\nThe lack of long-term data on the cure and \nrecurrence rates of the interventions under \nconsideration limits the analyses. Long-term \nperformance was extrapolated from short-term \ndata. Also assumptions had to be made about these \nparameters; for example, the recurrence rates of \nPFMT with extra sessions were assumed to be the \nsame as the PFMT basic. Due to a lack of reliable \ndata, it is unclear whether this assumption is valid \nor not.\nThere was also uncertainty around the costs \nestimates. It was very difficult to determine the \n\u2018standard\u2019 number of sessions that there were in \nbasic PFMT. Therefore, it was assumed that basic \nPFMT consisted of six sessions. These assumptions \nwere also applied to all therapies that had some \nform of PFMT. The other area where there was a \nlack of data was the quality-of-life estimates.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Non-surgical interventions, \nsuch as PFMT, may require long-term adherence to \nan exercise regimen to produce continued benefit \nbut (apart from medical therapies) they have few \nor no adverse events. Surgical treatment, on the \nother hand, may have a higher rate of cure or \nimprovement in symptoms but has a greater risk of \ncomplications.\nThe choice of treatment is influenced by patient \npreference, professional advice and the research \nevidence. It takes into account factors such as \nsymptom severity, degree of interference with \nlifestyle, presence of related problems and degree \nof comorbidity. A woman may seek and receive \nseveral different treatments during the course of \nher lifetime, and, from a health service perspective, \nit is important to balance effectiveness, potential \nadverse events and costs of individual treatments \nand alternative care pathways. This study aimed \nto assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness of alternative non-surgical treatments \nand treatment pathways for women with SUI.\nMain results\nSummary of results from the \nsurvey of factors important to \nwomen with SUI\nCentral to the estimation of both effectiveness and \ncost-effectiveness is that the outcome measures \nchosen reflect factors that are important to the \nwomen themselves. As reported in Chapter 4, \nmembers of The Bladder and Bowel Foundation \n(formerly members of InContact)99 (n = 188 \nwomen) were prospectively surveyed with the \naim of gathering information on outcomes of \nimportance to them and 105 responses were \nreceived. Areas of importance to women who \nsuffer from SUI were assessed using a PGI. In \naddition, the questionnaire included the King\u2019s \nHealth Questionnaire and the EQ-5D. The survey \nidentified 38 different areas of life affected by SUI. \nThe five most frequently reported were: going out \nor socialising, personal hygiene, sleep, shopping \nand depression. Ideally, these areas would then \nbe used to derive outcomes of relevance to \nwomen in primary studies and systematic reviews. \nHowever, these outcomes were rarely considered \nin primary studies. PGI scores and EQ-5D scores \nwere positively correlated and these correlations \nwere statistically significant. Nevertheless, the areas \nidentified by the PGI did not map well to the EQ-\n5D. Correlations between the seven domains of \nthe King\u2019s Health Questionnaire and PGI were all \nnegative but only two were statistically significant: \npersonal relationships and severity measures. \nThese data suggest that the PGI may be capturing \nconcerns of women who suffer from SUI which are \nnot adequately captured by generic instruments \nsuch as the EQ-5D.\nSummary of results from \nthe systematic review of \neffectiveness\nThe focus of the systematic reviews of effectiveness \nwas on the rates of cure and cure or improvement \n(this latter outcome is referred to in the text as \nimprovement), quality of life, and adverse events. \nThe systematic review of clinical effectiveness \nidentified 88 trials reporting data from 9721 \nwomen. The included studies covered five generic \ninterventions (PFMT with or without BF, ES, VCs, \nBT and SNRI medications) with many variations \nand combinations of them. Data were available \nfor 37 interventions and 68 direct head-to-head \n(pairwise) comparisons. The MTC included 14 \ntreatments and took data from the 55 trials (6608 \nwomen) that reported data for these treatments. \nCure data were available for 3560 women (38 trials) \nand improvement data were available for 6140 \nwomen (47 trials). In total, 41% and 61% of these \ndata for cure and improvement, respectively, came \nfrom 10 trials comparing SNRI with placebo.\nA summary of the treatment comparisons showing \nboth the direct comparisons and the MTC results \nis given in Table 81. PFMT with or without BF \nappeared to be more effective than no treatment \nboth in terms of cure and improvement. ES, SNRI, \nBT and PFMT plus ES had, on average, higher \nodds of cure and improvement compared with no \ntreatment. VCs, and PFMT plus SNRI had higher \nChapter 10  \nDiscussionDiscussion\n156\nodds of improvement compared with no treatment. \nThe direct, head-to-head comparisons were \ninconclusive about whether PFMT with or without \nBF was better than other treatments. For example, \nthe ORs (point estimate) for improvement favoured \nPFMT (with or without BF) over other standalone \ntreatments (ES, VCs, BT and SNRI), but the CIs \nwere wide and included one (no difference).\nThe MTC results provided similar results to the \ndirect comparisons. Because this comparison was \nable to draw upon both the direct and indirect \ncomparative evidence, it was able to provide more \nprecise estimates of relative effectiveness than \nprovided by the direct pairwise comparisons.\nPelvic floor muscle training, when supervised, with \nextra sessions (more than two sessions or contacts \nwith a health-care professional per month), was \nbetter than basic PFMT in terms of both cure and \nimprovement, as shown by both direct evidence \nand the MTC model (see the final row of each \nsection of Table 81 and, for the MTC model only, \nsee Table 82).\nBoth pelvic floor muscle training with extra \nsessions,and PFMT with BF were also more \neffective in terms of both cure and improvement \ncompared with: no treatment; ES; VCs; or SNRI \n(Table 82). There was considerable uncertainty \nabout whether either is better than BT.\nEvidence about PFMT (with or without BF) \ncombined with an adjunct treatment (e.g. ES, VCs) \nwas generally inconclusive, largely due to a lack \nof available data. Adding BT to PFMT with BF \nappears to be more effective than PFMT with BF \nalone or BT alone, although interpretation requires \ncaution, as this finding is based upon data from a \nsingle trial that considered a population who had \nboth stress and urgency incontinence symptoms. \nThe MTC results for these pairs of treatments were \nalso inconclusive.\nAll of these results need to be considered \ncautiously. Importantly, the longevity of any \ntreatment effects was unclear because of the small \namount of data available and limited duration of \nfollow-up.\nSummary of results from the \neconomic model\nData from the MTCs were used to populate \nan economic model. The economic model \npresented in this report compared eight different \nmanagement strategies. These were chosen because \nthey were believed to be relevant to the NHS \nand they might potentially be cost-effective. The \nmodel compared cumulative costs and QALYs for \na 40-year time horizon for two separate analyses; \none based on cure rates and the other based on \nimprovement rates.\nIn the model based on cure rates, the least costly \nstrategy was lifestyle intervention, followed by \nPFMT with extra sessions (or PFMT plus BF) and \nthen surgery if necessary, with a mean cost per \nwoman treated of \u00a31644. The most costly strategy \nwas lifestyle changes followed by surgery with a \nmean cost per woman treated of \u00a31973. In terms \nof QALYs, the least effective strategy was lifestyle \nchanges followed by surgery (mean QALYs per \nwoman treated = 16.1). The most effective was \nlifestyle changes followed by PFMT with extra \nsessions followed by surgery if necessary (mean \nQALYs per woman treated = 16.2). There were \nrelatively modest differences between treatments in \nterms of both QALYs and costs. One interpretation \nof these results would be that any of these \ntreatment strategies could be equally well provided \nby the NHS. Nevertheless, when the incremental \ncost-effectiveness was estimated then it was highly \nlikely that lifestyle changes followed by PFMT \nwith extra sessions followed by surgery if necessary \nwould be cost-effective (there was an over 70% \nchance that this intervention would be considered \ncost-effective at a threshold value of \u00a320,000 per \nQALY).\nFor the model based on improvement rates, the \nQALYs and costs for each treatment were greater \nthan those for the model based on cure rates. This \nis because improvement rates were greater than cure \nrates but no quality-of-life data that were specific \nto improvement were available. Therefore, it was \nassumed that the utility associated with improvement \nwas the same as the utility associated with cure. \nCosts were greater because it was assumed that \nwomen would incur some costs of containment \nproducts, even if their symptoms were improved. \nAs a consequence, comparisons with the analysis \nmade using cure rates should be interpreted \ncautiously.\nIn the model based on improvement rates, the least \ncostly strategy was lifestyle changes, followed by \nPFMT basic, PFMT with extra sessions and then \nsurgery (mean cost per woman treated = \u00a31795), \nand the most costly was lifestyle changes followed \nby surgery with a mean cost per woman treated \nof \u00a32425.

The most \neffective was lifestyle changes followed by PFMT \nwith extra sessions followed by surgery if necessary \n(mean QALYs per woman treated = 16.37). Which \ntreatment strategy was most likely to be cost-\neffective depended upon society\u2019s willingness to \npay for a QALY. Below a threshold of \u00a330,000 per \nQALY, lifestyle changes followed by PFMT basic \nand then surgery was the intervention most likely to \nbe considered cost-effective. Above that a threshold \nof \u00a330,000 per QALY, lifestyle changes followed \nby PFMT with extra sessions followed by surgery \nif necessary was most likely to be considered cost-\neffective. This strategy had a 55% likelihood of \nbeing considered cost-effective when society\u2019s \nwillingness to pay for a QALY was between \u00a310,000 \nand \u00a330,000.\nThe role of drug therapy appears limited, as \nstrategies involving drug management were \nunlikely to be considered cost-effective. This is \nprimarily due to the non-adherence to SNRI \ntreatment caused by the side effects of the drugs, \nwhich limited their effectiveness. Furthermore, \nthe strategy involving surgery without the use of \nnon-surgical treatments was not likely to be cost-\neffective.\nWhen success was defined in terms of cure or \nimprovement, the results were insensitive to the \nintroduction of strategies involving VCs or ES. It \nwas also found that the interpretation of the cost-\neffectiveness results did not greatly change when \nthe model was adapted to allow women to exercise \npreference not to seek surgery or repeat surgery, \nshould cure or sufficient improvement not be \nachieved.\nThese data suggest that adopting an intervention \nsuch as PFMT with extra sessions (or potentially \nother more intensive forms of PFMT, such as \nPFMT with BF) would be more efficient than \nPFMT basic. This is important as PFMT basic is \nperhaps closest to the form of PFMT most common \nin the NHS. Therefore, although PFMT basic does \nappear to improve the symptoms of women with \nSUI, consideration should be given to whether \nit is practical and acceptable to both women and \nthe NHS to provide some form of more intensive \nPFMT (either alone or with an adjunct, such as BF \ntraining).\nThe results were most sensitive to changes in the \neffectiveness of PFMT with extra sessions. Should \nthe chance of PFMT with extra sessions achieving \ncure or improvement reduce, or should longer-term \nrecurrence rates increase, then the likelihood that \nlifestyle changes followed by PFMT with extra \nsessions followed by surgery is cost-effective would \nfall. For the model based on cure rates, lifestyle \nchanges followed by PFMT with extra sessions \nfollowed by surgery would no longer be the most \ncost-effective strategy when long-term cure rates \nwere reduced by more than 60%. For the model \nbased on improvement rates, lifestyle changes \nfollowed by PFMT with extra sessions followed by \nsurgery would no longer the most cost-effective \nTABLE 81  Treatment comparisons from direct- and mixed-treatment methods (continued)Discussion\n160\nTABLE 82  Odds ratios for comparisons between PFMT with extra sessions and PFMT plus BF with other treatments (mixed-treatment \ncomparison models)\nIntervention\nCure, median (95% CrI)\nImprovement, median  \n(95% CrI) 1 2\nPFMT with extra sessions\nPFMT extra NT 10.7 (5.03 to 26.2) 25.7 (10.3 to 73.1)\nPFMT extra PFMT basic 8.36 (3.74 to 21.7) 5.75 (2.11 to 16.2)\nPFMT extra PFMT + BF 0.867 (0.45 to 1.69) 1.01 (0.32 to 3.16)\nPFMT extra ES 7.43 (2.72 to 22.3) 4.68 (1.75 to 13.2)\nPFMT extra VC 3.02 (1.04 to 9.53) 3.79 (1.32 to 11.5)\nPFMT extra SNRI80 7.44 (2.44 to 27.8) 12 (3.92 to 42.4)\nPFMT extra BT 1.41 (0.481 to 4.48) 2.13 (0.34 to 14.5)\nPFMT extra PFMT + ES 3.51 (1.12 to 10.2) 1.24 (0.27 to 5.79)\nPFMT extra PFMT + ES + BF 1.17 (0.07 to 20.5) 1.19 (0.23 to 6.3)\nPFMT extra PFMT + VC 3.45 (0.31 to 35.6) 2.11 (0.26 to 16)\nPFMT extra PFMT + VC + BF 1.87 (0.04 to 46.2) 9.66 (0.62 to 158)\nPFMT extra PFMT + BT + BF 0.422 (0.09 to 2.14) 0.369 (0.03 to 4.4)\nPFMT extra PFMT + drug \u2013  \u2013 5.82 (0.73 to 50.7)\nPFMT plus BF\nPFMT + BF NT 12.3 (5.35 to 32.7) 25.4 (8.68 to 86.9)\nPFMT + BF PFMT basic 9.63 (4.12 to 25.9) 5.68 (1.88 to 18.3)\nPFMT + BF PFMT extra 1.15 (0.59 to 2.22) 0.99 (0.32 to 3.11)\nPFMT + BF ES 8.55 (2.88 to 27.6) 4.63 (1.37 to 16.9)\nPFMT + BF VC 3.47 (1.19 to 11) 3.75 (1.17 to 12.5)\nPFMT + BF SNRI80 8.58 (2.64 to 33.4) 11.8 (3.37 to 48.4)\nPFMT + BF BT 1.62 (0.54 to 5.18) 2.11 (0.38 to 12.5)\nPFMT + BF PFMT + ES 4.05 (1.15 to 12.7) 1.23 (0.21 to 7.51)\nPFMT + BF PFMT + ES + BF 1.34 (0.07 to 24) 1.18 (0.27 to 5.21)\nPFMT + BF PFMT + VC 3.96 (0.35 to 41.2) 2.09 (0.25 to 16.7)\nPFMT + BF PFMT + VC + BF 2.14 (0.05 to 53.7) 9.54 (0.57 to 170)\nPFMT + BF PFMT + BT + BF 0.49 (0.11 to 2.28) 0.37 (0.04 to 3.61)\nPFMT + BF PFMT + drug \u2013  \u2013 5.75 (0.67 to 54.2)\nNote:  This table is extracted from Tables 85 and 86 reported in Appendix 23.\nstrategy when long-term improvement rates of \nPFMT with extra sessions were the same as PFMT \nbasic.

The \nstatistical approach of MTC allowed indirect \nevidence to supplement direct head-to-head \ncomparisons of treatments. This made the \ncomparison of treatments much easier than trying \nto interpret the data from the 68 direct head-to-\nhead (pairwise) comparisons.\nDespite extensive searching and the identification \nof a large number of studies, few data were \navailable for most comparisons. Over time this \nmay be rectified, and, indeed, an updated search \nconducted up to June 2009 identified additional 12 \narticles that appear to meet our inclusion criteria \n(these studies are listed in Appendix 28).\nOf the studies that were identified, nearly one-half \nof the participants in the included trials (46%, \n4554\/9803) came from the 12 trials that included \na SNRI as one of their trial arms. Given this, a \npragmatic decision was made to include studies \nwhere women with urgency urinary incontinence \nsymptoms also formed part of the study population \n(population types 2 and 3).\nGenerally, these studies were less likely to show \nlarge effect sizes than studies that only included \nwomen with SUI alone. The studies with mixed \npopulations, however, tended to have a larger \nsample, but involved fewer supervisory sessions \nthan studies of women with only SUI. Both of these \nfactors may also have affected the estimated size of \neffect.\nEven for the relatively simple clinical outcomes, \nsuch as cure or improvement, the lack of consensus \non the most appropriate method for assessing \nincontinence presented a particular problem \nfor evidence synthesis. Ideally, the success of a \ntreatment should be gauged on the ability of \nwomen to lead a normal social life. Using this \ndefinition usually means that the woman herself \nreports a satisfactory resolution (or near resolution) \nof her symptoms. Unfortunately, patient-reported \nmeasures were not always available. Moreover, \navailable data (including proxy measures based \non the quantification of symptoms derived from \ndiaries or pad tests) did not differentiate those who \nare sufficiently better (and do not want further \ntreatment) from those who are better but do want \nfurther treatment.\nA further challenge for evidence synthesis that is \nrelated to the lack of consistency between studies \nand the limited reporting of studies was that \nintervention protocols were complex and varied \nconsiderably across studies. For example, PFMT \ndiffered widely in terms of the precise nature of \nthe exercises, how patients were instructed, and the \nfrequency and duration of therapy (Appendix 12). \nGenerally, such data were poorly reported, with \nthe exercise protocol not consistently described \nusing the same criteria. In an attempt to explore \nthe impact of intensity of therapy, PFMT was \ndefined solely by the frequency of supervisory clinic \nsessions or contacts with a health-care professional. \nSimilarly, the complex nature of the intervention \nprotocols also meant that it was difficult to \ndecipher which aspect of the intervention actually \nworked. For example, the addition of BF training \nto PFMT appeared beneficial in enhancing the \neffect of PFMT. This may have occurred because \nwomen made greater use of PFMT and increased \ntheir adherence to the training programme. \nIntroducing a BF device may also intensify the \nnature or the quantity of supervision provided by \nthe health-care professional, which, in itself, may \nbe beneficial for women. What the research does \nhighlight is the importance of intensity of therapy \non effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and the \nneed for the evidence-based development of more \nintensive regimens that can be taken forward to \nrigorous evaluation in adequately powered RCTs.\nWhen assessing the effectiveness of treatment \nemphasis was given to using the data collected \nat the end of the supervised treatment phase. \nIt was expected that these data would represent \nthe point where the treatments would show their \nmaximum effect. Long-term data beyond the \nsupervised treatment phase were sparse but the \nevidence gathered for the economic evaluation \nsuggests that the effectiveness was not maintained. Discussion\n162\nThis may be due to poor adherence to a muscle \ntraining programme or whether the effects of \ntraining can be sustained into the longer term. The \nresults of the economic evaluation are sensitive to \nchanges in long-term performance of non-surgical \ninterventions. Improvements in the long-term \nperformance will improve the cost-effectiveness of \nnon-surgical treatments.\nAlthough the meta-analyses have limitations, \none of the strengths of this study is that it has \nused these rigorously assembled data within an \neconomic evaluation. This economic evaluation \ncompared treatment strategies relevant to the NHS \nand hitherto no such analysis existed. Indeed, \nno economic evaluations were identified which \ncompared all the relevant treatments.\nModelling the cost-effectiveness of non-surgical \ntreatments was challenging because of the number \nof potential management strategies that might \nbe relevant and also the lack of data available. \nAs described in Chapter 9, considerable efforts \nwere made to identify relevant data, and extensive \nsensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact \nof uncertainties. Useful information to help \nguide practice has been produced but it should \nbe remembered that, apart from drug therapy, \nfew data were available for any of the treatments, \nand very few data on long-term performance were \navailable for any therapy. Therefore, the results of \nthis study should be treated cautiously.\nAll of the strategies considered within the economic \nmodel included lifestyle advice (e.g. reduce weight, \nrestrict caffeine intake, etc.). It was assumed that, \nalthough advice would be given, it would be \nineffective. A recent trial has shown that weight \nreduction (lifestyle change) in obese women may \nreduce the symptoms of incontinence and further \nwork on lifestyle interventions may be worthwhile.\nWithin the economic evaluation the effectiveness \nof treatments were measured in QALYs, which \nwere derived from EQ-5D values obtained from \nthe literature (and in a sensitivity analysis from \na survey conducted as part of this study). The \nEQ-5D has been recommended as the method of \nvaluing health states by NICE,105 but it may not be \nsensitive enough to capture the concerns of women. \nAny failure to accurately measure the benefits of \ntreatment may lead to erroneous conclusions about \ncost-effectiveness.\nA further limitation of the economic model \nwas that there were no quality-of-life data to \ndifferentiate between cure and improvement. It \nmight be expected that the quality of life of women \nwhose symptoms had improved but who were \nnot cured would be less than women who were \ncured. Alternatively, changes in the frequency of \nincontinence may fail to translate into benefits of \nimportance to women. Ideally, further research \nshould be conducted on the quality of life of \nwomen whose symptoms are improved and who no \nlonger seek further treatment.\nWithin all of the economic analyses, the \npreferences of women for the process of care have \nnot been considered. Women are likely to have \npreferences about who provides the care, where \nthe care is provided, and what risks and costs they \nface themselves. These factors are not captured \nby measures such as the EQ-5D. Therefore, \nresearch to elicit the preferences of women for the \ndifferent outcomes and processes of treatment in \na form that is suitable for incorporation into an \neconomic evaluation is likely to be worthwhile. \nSuch data would be complementary to existing \ndata and could help to highlight areas in which the \npreferences of women for outcomes of importance \nto them would lead to different policy decisions.\nThe economic model has focused on costs to \nthe NHS. It has been assumed that certain costs, \nsuch as those for VCs and containment products, \nmay be incurred by the NHS. In practice, women \nmay buy the cones and may well incur the costs \nof containment management themselves. Other \ncosts that may fall on the women have not \nbeen included. These include the other costs of \nmanaging symptoms, such as laundry costs, and \nthe time and travel costs related to accessing \ncare. It might be expected that the more effective \ntreatments would reduce the costs of managing \nsymptoms borne by the women and their families. \nHowever, the more effective treatments may also \nrequire substantially more time commitment (and \ntravel costs to access care) from the women. The \nnet effect of these two factors is uncertain.\nA further limitation with respect to costs is \nthat the handling of facility costs and hospital \nmanagement costs has not been wholly consistent. \nFor example, for some interventions, such as the \nuse of physiotherapy, the cost has been used upon \nthe staff and equipment used to provide a session \nbut has not included an element to cover the \nfacility and management costs. However, for other \ninterventions, for example the cost of surgery, \nthese are based on nationally available figures that \ndo include an element to cover facility costs and DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

However, as \nthe sensitivity analysis has illustrated, increases in \nthe cost of PFMT would need to be substantial to \nchange the overall results and it is implausible that \nthis would actually be the case.\nNevertheless, despite the limitations of the \nevidence base, there is evidence from a number \nof trials that PFMT plus BF and PFMT with extra \nsessions was effective. Furthermore, strategies \ninvolving these treatments are likely to be \nconsidered cost-effective at threshold values that \nsociety might be willing to pay for a QALY.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.

There is, however, insufficient evidence to \nrecommend their routine use by the NHS.\n\u2022  A strategy by which women can progress to \nsurgery almost immediately is unlikely to be \ncost-effective, primarily because of the cost of \nsurgery.\n\u2022  Treatment with SNRI drugs are, on average, \neffective (measured in terms of cure or \nimprovement), but the frequency of side \neffects mean that women do not tend to use \nthis therapy for long. Therefore, strategies \ninvolving SNRI are unlikely to be cost-effective.\n\u2022  As no treatment or treatment strategy is \nperfect, women should be offered support to \nhelp them articulate what it is that they hope to \nachieve from therapy.\n\u2022  The differences between the treatment \nstrategies considered (measured in QALYs) \nwere relatively modest and, although some \nstrategies were found to be more likely to be \ncost-effective, the evidence base was limited.\n\u2022  The feasibility of the potentially cost-effective \nmore intensive forms of PFMT is questionable, \nas there may not be sufficient trained therapists \nto provide this care at present. For the use of \nthese therapies to increase, staff would need \nto be recruited, trained and retained. Recent \nsurveys about the provision of care by the NHS \nby the Continence Foundation (Judith Wardle, \nformerly of the Continence Foundation, March \n2009, personal communication) found that \nless costly therapists were being substituted \nfor the higher-grade continence nurse \nspecialists. Given the potential demand for \ncare, non-specialist care providers are likely \nto be necessary, in addition to care provided \nby specialist therapists, but they will need \nappropriate training.\n\u2022  Opportunities for self-management by the \nwomen should be encouraged, as women \ncan purchase VCs themselves or they could \nundertake PFMT without formal supervision. \nTherapies are most likely to be effective and \ncost-effective when women receive training so \nthat they can perform the exercises correctly.\n\u2022  Continuing and ongoing support for women \nwith SUI may be required beyond current \nprogrammes, as long-term performance is \ncentral to estimates of long-term effectiveness.\n\u2022  Conversely, providing therapies when there is \nno sustained follow-up may not be a good use \nof scarce practitioner time or resources.\nImplications for women\nNon-surgical treatment for SUI can provide either \ncure or improvement in symptoms. A non-surgical \ntreatment might not totally resolve symptoms \nbut may lead to sufficient improvement so that \na woman considers that further treatment is \nnot worthwhile. Although the woman may not \ndesire further treatment, it should be noted that \nsymptoms may still be bothersome and may require \nthe use of containment products. The cost of using \ncontainment products and extra laundry will still \nfall on women and their families.\nFor some women, non-surgical treatments can \ndelay or prevent the need for surgery. This may \nbe particularly important for those women who \nhave no desire to undergo surgery and may be \nprepared to accept severe incontinence rather \nthan face surgery. The recourse to surgery early \nChapter 11  \nConclusionsConclusions\n166\nin a treatment pathway might be preferred by \nsome women who are unable to use non-surgical \ntreatments or who are unwilling to devote the \nsustained time and effort required to obtain and \nmaintain an improvement in symptoms. However, \nover the longer term better outcomes might be \nachieved if the women try out a non-surgical \ntreatment first.\nSome of the therapies do not necessarily need \ninvolvement of the health service. Women \ncan purchase VCs themselves, or they could \nundertake PFMT without formal supervision. \nThese treatments can be effective, but whether \nthis is worthwhile depends upon the ability of \nthe woman to perform the therapy correctly. \nTherefore, women should consider whether some \nformal instruction by suitably trained health-care \nprofessionals would be helpful to ensure that they \nare performing correct contractions.\nThe long-term success of the treatments such as \nPFMT declines over time. One potential reason for \nwhy this happens is that women do not continue \nto perform the exercises in the long term. This \nrequires a behaviour change that women might \nfind difficult to initiate and maintain. Without \nmaking and maintaining this change, it is likely \nthat symptoms will return and further treatments, \nincluding surgery, might be required.\nFurther research\nEvidence has been provided to show that several \nof the non-surgical treatments for SUI can be \neffective, at least in the short term, and are \npotentially cost-effective. The evidence, however, is \nbased upon a number of small trials, and, for many \ncomparisons, only single trials.\n\u2022  Further definitive evidence from large well-\ndesigned studies of the most promising \nregimens (in terms of likely effectiveness, cost-\neffectiveness and feasibility within the health \nservice) is required to provide a definitive \nanswer.\n\u2022  Any further research, be it from a trial, on \nlong-term outcomes, benefit assessment, or \ncosts, should be incorporated into an updated \neconomic evaluation, as and when it becomes \navailable.\n\u2022  Such trials should consider the long-term \neffectiveness of more intensive versions of \nPFMT (e.g. PFMT with BF training) in typical \nstandard health-care setting and an economic \nmodelling exercise that will place the results \nof the trial into the context of other relevant \nresearch and extrapolate from the trial results.\n\u2022  The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will \ndepend upon the long-term effective of \ntreatments, which, in turn, may depend upon \nwhether any training programme is adhered to \nand sustained into the longer term. Research \nin how this might be achieved in a way that \nis feasible for both the NHS and women is \nrequired.\n\u2022  Further work to understand what outcomes \nare of importance to women and the strength \nof preference of women for these outcomes is \nrequired.\n\u2022  Understanding the preferences of women for \ndifferent ways that care could be provided, and \nthe trade-offs between different process and \noutcome measures, would be useful. Women \nmay also have preferences about the process \nof care as well as the outcome of care. Ideally, \nsuch data should be suitable for incorporation \ninto a subsequent economic evaluation.\n\u2022  The impact of costs (both in terms of out \nof pocket expenses and time) that fall upon \nwomen and their families should be explored \nfurther. Specifically, information is needed \nabout the trade-off between the costs of \nmanaging symptoms (use of self-purchased \ncontainment products, laundry costs, etc.) and \nthe time and travel costs of treatment.\n\u2022  If an effective and efficient follow-up regimen \ncan be developed, then the incentives\/\ndisincentives faced by NHS providers may \nneed to be reconsidered. For example, within \nEngland, performance current monitoring \ngoals might lead to a focus on \u2018first contacts\u2019 at \nthe expense of follow-up care.\nSummary of conclusions\nMore intensive forms of PFMT (\u2018PFMT with extra \nsessions\u2019 and \u2018PFMT with BF\u2019) are effective and \npotentially worthwhile uses of NHS resources. \nNevertheless, the data came from a few small \ntrials and further information from large well-\ndesigned studies is required to establish whether \nthese interventions are effective, cost-effective and \nfeasible for the NHS to provide.DOI: 10.3310\/hta14400  Health Technology Assessment 2010; Vol. 14: No. 40\n\u00a9 2010 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO.
