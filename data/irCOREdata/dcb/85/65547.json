Introduction \nFinancial constraints have been found to play an important role in various aspects of firm \nbehavior, such as determining their investment in fixed capital, inventories, and R&D (see \nHubbard, 1998; and Bond and Van Reenen, 2006, for surveys). Most studies in this \nliterature have used firm-level data to estimate investment equations augmented with \nfinancial variables such as cash flow, and interpreted a high sensitivity of investment to \nthese variables as a proxy for a high degree of financing constraints faced by firms. A \nfinancially constrained firm, for which it is difficult or too expensive to obtain external \nfinance, will in fact only invest if it has sufficient internal funds, and will invest more (less) \nthe higher (lower) its cash flow1. Higher sensitivities were generally found for firms that \nwere a priori more likely to face financing constraints, such as small, young firms, and \nfirms with low dividend payouts and high levels of indebtedness.  \nYet, surprisingly, the effects of financial constraints on firm survival have been \nlargely neglected in the literature: only a handful of papers have included financial \nvariables in equations modelling survival probabilities (Bunn and Redwood, 2003; \nFotopoulos and Louri, 2000; Vartia, 2004; Zingales, 1998)2. Using data from a wide range \nof countries, they found a significant association between financial variables and firms\u2019 \nsurvival probabilities. Yet, none of these studies exploited firm heterogeneity to better \nunderstand this link. This paper seeks to fill this gap. Specifically, we analyze for the first \ntime the effects of financial variables on firm survival probabilities, differentiating firms \ninto globally engaged and purely domestic. We consider two dimensions of global \nengagement. The first is based on whether the firms are foreign owned, and the second on \nwhether they export3. Differentiating the effects of financial variables on survival \nprobabilities for globally engaged and domestic firms is motivated by a number of recent \nempirical papers, which argue that global engagement may shield firms from financial \nconstraints, and consequently improve their performance. Using data for the UK, Guariglia \nand Mateut (2005), for example, find that small, young, and risky firms that are globally \nengaged exhibit lower sensitivities of inventory investment to financial variables than their \ndomestic counterparts. This makes them less financially constrained, as they do not have to \n                                                 \n1 This view has been challenged by Kaplan and Zingales (1997), Cleary (1999), and Cummins et al. (2006). \n2 Throughout the paper, we use the terms survival and failure interchangeably, keeping in mind that one is the \nflip side of the other. \n3 A number of papers (Bernard and Sj\u00f6holm, 2003; G\u00f6rg and Strobl, 2003) have looked at the direct effects of \nglobal engagement on firm survival. However, their main focus is on multinationals\u2019 voluntary exit from a \nmarket, which takes place by shifting production from one country to another in the presence of adverse \nshocks in the host country. Contrary to theirs, our analysis mainly focuses on firms\u2019 death as a consequence of \nfailure (involuntary exit). \n3 rely as much on internal funds to finance inventory investment4. Similarly, using data \nfrom various emerging markets, Desai et al. (2007) document that, contrary to their purely \ndomestic counterparts, affiliates of multinational firms are able to expand output after \nsevere depreciations when both growth opportunities and financial constraints arise. \nFinally, focusing on Indonesia, Blalock et al. (2004) show that following the 1997 East \nAsian financial crisis which led to a strong currency devaluation, only foreign-owned \nexporters were able to significantly increase their investment. Although the global \nengagement-induced improvements in plant performance documented by these authors are \nlikely to translate themselves into increases in their chances of survival, none of these \nstudies have explicitly tested whether global engagement affects firm survival, by shielding \nfirms from liquidity constraints. This is the objective of this paper.  \nThe main reasons why global engagement may shield firms from liquidity \nconstraints can be summarized as follows. First, globally engaged firms have access to both \ninternal and international financial markets, which allows them to diversify their sources of \nfinancing and the associated risks. In particular, foreign owned firms can access credit \nthrough their parent company and thus insure themselves against liquidity constraints \n(Desai et al., 2004). Second, foreign owned firms typically enjoy less bankruptcy risk and \nadopt international standards faster in terms of product quality. Consequently, they find it \neasier to gain access to domestic banks (Colombo, 2001; Harrison and McMillan, 2003). \nThird, being dependent on demand from foreign countries, exporting firms are tied less to \nthe domestic cycle, and less subject to those financial constraints induced by tight monetary \npolicy and recessions at home5. This may lead to a more stable cash flow for exporters \ncompared to non-exporters, which in turn is likely to lead to a relaxation of the liquidity \nconstraints for the former, as a more stable cash flow provides greater assurances to lenders \nthat the firm will be able to service its obligations (Hirsch and Lev, 1971; Campa and \nShaver, 2002; Garcia-Vega and Guariglia, 2007). Finally, given the presence of sunk costs \nthat need to be met when entering foreign markets for the first time (Robets and Tybout, \n1997), being an exporter also provides a signal that the firm is sufficiently productive to \ngenerate enough profits in foreign markets to recover the sunk costs. This increases the \nlikelihood that the firm will be able to service its external debt, and further relaxes the \nliquidity constraints that it faces (Campa and Shaver, 2002).  \n                                                 \n4 Also see Greenaway et al. (2007), who using the same UK data limited to the manufacturing sector, find that \nexporters typically exhibit better financial health than non-exporters. \n5 This argument relies on the assumption that business cycles are not perfectly coordinated across countries. \n4 If global engagement indeed shields firms from financing constraints, then we \nwould expect failure probabilities of globally engaged firms to be less sensitive to financial \nvariables than those of purely domestic firms. We test this hypothesis using a panel of \n61496 UK firms over the period 1997-2002. Our choice of the UK is motivated by two \nconsiderations. First, this country ranks high in terms of global engagement: it is the fifth \nlargest exporter of manufacturing goods globally and the second largest host of \nmultinational enterprises. Second, to the best of our knowledge, virtually no other study has \nlooked at the links between global engagement and firm survival probabilities in the UK.  \nWe find that when firms are divided according to whether they are globally engaged \nor purely domestic, lower collateral and higher leverage result in higher failure probabilities \nfor the latter. This supports our hypothesis that global engagement shields firms from \nliquidity constraints. Our results are robust to estimating Logit and Cox proportional hazard \nmodels; to controlling for the biases induced by rare event data and for unobserved \nheterogeneity; and to including in our sample only those firms established after 1996 \n(newly established firms). For the latter firms, the results are also robust to considering the \ntwo dimensions of global engagement (exporting and being foreign owned) separately. \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our \nbaseline specification. Section 3 describes our data, and provides some descriptive \nstatistics. Section 4 presents our main empirical results and a range of robustness tests. \nSection 5 concludes. \n \n2. Baseline specification \nWe initially estimate the following Logit model for the probability of firm failure \n)1( =itFAIL on the pooled data set6: \n \n )'()1Pr( \u03b2itit XFFAIL ==        (1) \n \nwhere Xit\u2019 is a matrix of characteristics of firm i at time t with coefficients \u03b2 . \nAs in Bunn and Redwood (2003), we define a firm as failed (dead) in a given year if \nits company status is that of receivership, liquidation, or dissolved7. Since more than 75 \n                                                 \n6 Lennox (1999a) and Bernard et al. (2006) also estimated Logit models of firm survival. On the other hand, \nZingales (1998), Lennox (1999a), Bernard and Jensen (1999, 2007), and Bunn and Redwood (2003) estimated \nProbit models. All our results were robust to using a Probit instead of a Logit in estimation. \n5 percent of our failed firms were either in liquidation or in receivership, we can say that our \nmain focus is on firms\u2019 death as a consequence of bankruptcy, not voluntary exit.  \nOur Xit\u2019 matrix includes measures of the firm\u2019s age (Ageit), size (Sizeit), and \nprofitability (Profitabilityit); a dummy indicating whether the firm is part of a group \n(Groupi); and financial variables (Leverageit and Collateralit) interacted with dummies \nindicating whether the firm is globally engaged (GEit) or purely domestic (1-GEit). Sizeit \nrepresents the size of firm i at time t, measured in terms of the logarithm of its total real \nassets. Since firms typically enter the market at a small size relative to their minimum \nefficient scale, we expect exit rates to be decreasing in size (Audretsch and Mahmood, \n1995)8. Profitabilityit is measured as the firm\u2019s profit margin, i.e. the ratio of its profits \nbefore interests and tax to its total assets. It is included as a proxy for the firm\u2019s efficiency \n(Bunn and Redwood, 2003)9. We expect more profitable firms to be less likely to fail. \nGroupi is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm is part of a group (UK or foreign), and 0 \notherwise10. It is included, following Disney et al. (2003), and is expected to have a \nnegative effect on the probability of firm failure: group firms are likely to have better \naccess to capital markets and to respond more quickly to shocks than single firms due to \nbetter information processing. Leverageit and Collateralit are financial variables proxying \nrespectively for the degree of indebtedness of the firm, and its degree of collateralization, \nsimilar to those used by Fotopoulos and Louri (2000). Specifically, Leverageit represents \nthe firm\u2019s short-term debt to assets ratio; and Collateralit, its collateral ratio, given by the \nratio of the firm\u2019s tangible to total assets11.  \n                                                                                                                                                     \n7 Liquidation and receivership are two types of reorganization procedures, which can take place when a \ncompany becomes insolvent. In liquidation, the assets of the company are sold so as to meet the claims of \ncreditors. In receivership, the receiver can decide whether it is in the creditors\u2019 interests to sell the company\u2019s \nassets. Generally, it is in the creditors\u2019 interests to liquidate if the liquidation value of the company exceeds its \ngoing concern value (Lennox, 1999b). As in Bunn and Redwood (2003) and Lennox (1999b), exits by \ntakeover are not included in our definition of failure, as takeovers may be regarded as a sign of success rather \nthan failure.  \n8 We think that current size is a better predictor of a firm\u2019s survival chances than size at start-up because it \ncaptures a firm\u2019s ability to adapt to a changing competitive environment (Mata and Portugal, 1994). Our \nresults were robust to replacing current size with initial size. \n9 Bernard and Jensen (2007) have emphasized the role of productivity on firm survival. We did not include a \nmeasure of productivity in our estimating Equation due to data problems: information on employment is in \nfact missing for a large number of observations. We are convinced, however, that profitability, which we \nincluded in all our regressions, is a good proxy for productivity. \n10 A company is said to be part of a group if it is a subsidiary of one or more (UK or foreign) holding \ncompanies. A drawback of this variable is that it is time-invariant: the information only refers to the latest \nyear available for each firm. \n11 Our results were robust to using alternative measures of indebtedness, such as the firm\u2019s total (short- and \nlong-term) debt to assets ratio, or its total liabilities to total assets ratio. They were also robust to considering a \nbroader measure of collateral given by the firm\u2019s tangible assets plus inventory stock over its total assets. The \nresults based on these different financial variables are not reported for brevity, but are available upon request.  \n6 Especially for firms a priori more likely to face financing constraints and during \nrecessions, being highly leveraged increases moral hazard and adverse selection problems, \nand leads to the inability of firms to obtain external finance at a reasonable cost. High \nleverage is in fact associated with an unhealthy balance sheet. Also considering that \nservicing a high debt may become obstructive for the operation and eventually for the \nexistence of firms, we expect highly leveraged firms to be less likely to survive (Fotopoulos \nand Louri, 2000). On the other hand, we expect firms with a high collateral ratio to \nexperience lower probabilities of failing. The higher this ratio, the more collateralized and \ncommitted firms are, and the less likely they are to face financing constraints. Assets that \nare more tangible sustain in fact more external financing because tangibility increases the \nvalue that can be recaptured by creditors if borrowers default (Carpenter and Petersen, \n2002b; Braun and Larrain, 2005). As in the financing constraints literature, we interpret \nhigher sensitivities of firms\u2019 survival probabilities to these financial variables as an \nindicator of a higher level of financing constraints faced by firms: the more financially \nhealthy a firm is, the less its leverage and collateral will impact on its probability of failure.  \nGiven that our objective is to verify whether there is a differential effect of the \nfinancial variables on the failure probabilities of globally engaged and purely domestic \nfirms, we interact our financial variables as follows: Leverageit*[1-GEit]; \nLeverageit*[GEit]; Collateralit*[1-GEit]; and Collateralit*[GEit], where GEit is a dummy \nvariable equal to 1 if the firm is globally engaged, and 0 otherwise. This exercise is \nmotivated by Guariglia and Mateut (2005), Desai et al. (2007), and Blalock et al. (2004), \naccording to which global engagement improves firms\u2019 performance by shielding them \nfrom financial constraints. If this hypothesis were true, financial variables should have a \nweaker effect on globally engaged firms\u2019 probabilities of failure, compared to domestic \nfirms\u2019: the coefficients and marginal effects associated with Leverageit*[1-GEit] and \nCollateralit*[1-GEit] should be larger than those associated with Leverageit*[GEit] and \nCollateralit*[GEit]12.  \nOur Xit\u2019 matrix also includes a full set of industry dummies, as well as a full set of \ntime dummies to control for business cycle effects13. Since the average length of time \n                                                 \n12 Instead of using interaction terms, we could estimate our Logit Equation separately for globally engaged \nand purely domestic firms. Our chosen approach is preferable as it allows us to gain degrees of freedom and \nto take into consideration the fact that firms can transit between the globally engaged and purely domestic \nstates. All our results were robust to estimating separate regressions for globally engaged and purely domestic \nfirms. These results are not reported for brevity, but are available upon request. \n13 Our full set of industry dummies is made up of 24 dummies, which are described in the Appendix. Only 23 \nof these dummies were included in our regressions. Our results were robust to replacing the industry dummies \n7 between the final annual report of a failing company and its entry into bankruptcy is \nusually 14 months (Lennox, 1999a), our regressors are evaluated at time t. Yet, all our \nresults were robust to using lagged regressors. \n \n3. Main features of the data and summary statistics \n \n3.1 The dataset \nWe construct our dataset from the profit and loss and balance sheet data gathered by the \nBureau Van Dijk in the Financial Analysis Made Easy (FAME) database14. More than 99 \npercent of the firms included in this dataset are not traded on the stock market, or are \nquoted on other exchanges such as the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and the Off-\nExchange (OFEX) market. Unquoted firms are more likely to be characterized by adverse \nfinancial attributes such as a short track record, poor solvency, and low real assets \ncompared to quoted firms, which are typically large, financially healthy, long-established \ncompanies with good credit ratings. \nOur dataset provides information on companies over the period 1997-2002. The \nfirms in our dataset operate in the entire economy15. We excluded companies that changed \nthe date of their accounting year-end by more than a few weeks, so that the data refers to \ntwelve month accounting periods. Firms that did not have complete records on assets, \nprofitability, and the financial and global engagement variables that we included in our \nregressions were also dropped. Finally, to control for the potential influence of outliers, we \nexcluded observations in the one percent tails for each of the regression variables. Our \npanel therefore comprises of a total of 253151 annual observations (firm-years) on 61496 \n                                                                                                                                                     \nwith industry-specific variables commonly used in the firm survival literature, such as the investment rate, the \nemployment growth rate, the median firm size (to proxy for the minimum efficient scale of the industry), and \na Herfindahl index measured in terms of firms\u2019 employment shares (to proxy for the level of competition in \nthe industry). Our results were also robust to using a more disaggregated set of 56 industry dummies, \nreflecting the two-digit UK SIC codes.  \n14 We only selected firms that have unconsolidated accounts: this ensures that the majority of the firms in our \ndataset are relatively small. Moreover, it avoids the double counting of firms belonging to groups, which \nwould be included in the dataset if firms with consolidated accounts were also part of it. It has to be noted that \nUK accounting regulations have reporting exemptions for some variables for the smaller firms. Although our \nanalysis is confined to the sub-sample which reports the required information, we believe that a sufficiently \nlarge portion of the economy is covered by our dataset. Also see Bunn and Redwood (2003) who used the \nFAME dataset to study business failures in the UK. \n15 A number of studies that looked at the effects of financing constraints on firm behavior excluded from their \nanalysis financial, insurance, real estate, and public administration companies (Cleary, 1999; Bunn and \nRedwood, 2003; Cleary et al., 2004). All our results were robust to excluding these companies from our \nsample. These results based on the restricted sample are not reported for brevity, but are available upon \nrequest. \n8 companies, covering the years 1997-2002. It has an unbalanced structure, with the number \nof years of observations on each firm varying between 1 and 616.  \nFollowing Mata et al. (1995), Audretsch and Mahmood (1995), Fotopoulos and \nLouri (2000), Bernard and Sj\u00f6holm (2003), and Disney et al. (2003), we subsequently limit \nour analysis to newly established firms, that is to all cohorts of firms established between \n1996 and 2002. The rationale for this is that, otherwise, of those firms born before 1996, \nonly those that survived long enough to still be alive in 1996 would be observed, leading to \na sample selection bias. Our shorter panel comprises of a total of 27900 annual \nobservations (firm-years) on 9420 companies, covering the years 1997-2002.  \n \n3.2 Summary statistics \nTable 1 refers to the full sample and presents means and standard deviations of the main \nvariables likely to influence company failure, for all firm-years in our sample (column 1), \nfor surviving firm-years and failed firm-years (columns 2 and 3), and for globally engaged \nand purely domestic firm-years (columns 4 and 5)17. Table 2 presents similar information \nfor the sample of newly established firms. Focusing on Table 1, we can see that out of our \n253151 firm-years, 4475 (1.77 percent) were recorded as failed. This figure is consistent \nwith Bunn and Redwood (2003) and Lennox (1999a). Furthermore, without holding other \nfactors constant, surviving firm-years are generally larger than failed firm-years, where size \nis measured in terms of total real assets. Surviving firm-years are also older and more likely \nto be part of a group (UK or foreign). Coming to global engagement, surviving firm-years \nare more likely to be globally engaged than their failed counterparts (35 percent of the \nsurviving firm-years are globally engaged compared to 28 percent of their domestic \ncounterparts). Yet, because the probability of exporting is similar across the two groups \n(37-38 percent), it is the foreign ownership dimension of global engagement that seems to \ndrive this result (24 percent of the surviving firm-years are foreign owned, versus 10 \npercent of their domestic counterparts). Regarding the financial variables, failed firm-years \ndisplay lower collateral ratios (0.25) and higher leverage ratios (0.31) than surviving firm-\nyears (for which the ratios are respectively 0.30 and 0.25).  \nWhen firm-years are differentiated across globally engaged and purely domestic \nfirms (columns 4 and 5), we can see that the former are larger, more likely to be part of a \n                                                 \n16 See the Appendix for more information on the structure of our panel and complete definitions of all \nvariables used. \n17 The variance-covariance matrix of the main variables used in estimation is presented in Table A1 in the \nAppendix. \n9 group, and less likely to fail than their domestic counterparts. Both types of firm-years \ndisplay similar levels of collateral (22-24 percent), and leverage (31-33 percent).  \nA similar broad picture emerges if we limit ourselves to the sample of newly \nestablished firms (Table 2). Surprisingly, however, in this smaller sample, we observe that \nsurviving firm-years are slightly younger than failed ones. Moreover, compared to their \ndomestic counterparts, globally engaged firm-years display lower levels of collateral (0.24 \nversus 0.33) and higher levels of debt (0.43 versus 0.31). Considering that they are larger, \nand characterized by a lower incidence of death (1.2 percent) than their domestic \ncounterparts (1.8 percent), their high leverage and low collateral could stem from their \nability to borrow much, without the need to post high collateral.  \nIn the next Section, we will analyze the link between financial variables and failure \nprobabilities, conditional on other firm characteristics. A stronger link will be interpreted as \nevidence of stronger financing constraints.  \n \n4. Empirical results \n \n4.1 Main empirical results \nOur empirical results are reported in Table 3 (for the full sample) and Table 4 (for the sub-\nsample of newly established firms). Column 1 of both Tables sets out the results of \nestimating Equation (1) using a pooled Logit specification18. The results suggest that for the \nfull sample, there is a negative and significant association between firms\u2019 age and their \nprobability of failure, while for newly established firms, the association is positive. A \nnumber of theoretical papers (e.g. Jovanovic, 1982; Hopehayn, 1992) have devised models \nof company failure, and argued that the hazard of exit should fall with age as firms use their \nexperience of market signals to learn about their own (previously unknown) productivity. \nIn line with these models, a number of empirical papers have generally found that younger \nfirms are more likely to fail (e.g. Audretsch and Mahmood, 1995; Mata and Portugal, 1994; \nDisney at al., 2003). Our different finding for the sample of newly established firms is \nlikely to be driven by the small size of the sample19. Furthermore, as expected, for both our \nsamples, larger firms and firms that are part of a group are less likely to die. In line with \n                                                 \n18 The standard errors are adjusted to allow for clustering for each individual company. We also estimated a \nmore general version of our Equation, which contained the global engagement dummy in addition to its \ninteractions with the financial variables. Because the dummy generally attracted a poorly determined \ncoefficient, we excluded it in the reported specifications. The inclusion of the dummy did not alter any of the \nresults. \n19 Adding a quadratic term in age resulted in a poorly determined coefficient and did not alter this finding. \n10\n Bunn and Redwood (2003), when the full sample is considered, the profit margin displays \na negative and significant association with the probability of failure. Yet, when only newly \nestablished firms are considered, this variable appears to have little or no impact on \nsurvivorship. Once again, this result is likely to be driven by the small size of the sample. \nComing to the financial variables, we can see that, in the full sample, they play a \nstatistically significant effect both on the domestic and globally engaged firms\u2019 failure \nprobabilities (Table 3). Yet, the effects are always larger (in absolute value) for the former. \nThe marginal effects (not reported for brevity) suggest that increasing the leverage ratio by \none standard deviation, would raise the probability of failure of a domestic firm by 0.18 \npercentage points, and that of a globally engaged firm, by 0.10 percentage points. Similarly, \nraising the collateral ratio by one standard deviation would reduce a domestic firm\u2019s \nprobability of failure by 0.28 percentage points, while the corresponding probability of a \nglobally engaged firm would only be reduced by 0.17 percentage points20.  \nFor the sample of newly established firms (Table 4), the financial variables only \naffect domestic firms\u2019 chances of survival: increasing these firms\u2019 leverage ratio by one \nstandard deviation, would raise their probability of failure by 0.12 percentage points, while \nraising their collateral ratio by one standard deviation would reduce their probability of \nfailure by 0.36 percentage points. These findings support our hypothesis that global \nengagement affects UK firms\u2019 survival probabilities by making them less vulnerable to \nfinancial constraints. It is in line with Guariglia and Mateut (2005) who, using the FAME \ndataset limited to the manufacturing sector, measured liquidity constraints as the sensitivity \nof firms\u2019 inventory investment to financial variables, and found that only the inventory \ninvestment of those small, young, and risky firms, which are purely domestic responds to \nchanges in financial variables. Thus, although newly established globally engaged firms \ndisplay higher leverage and lower collateral than their domestic counterparts, these \nattributes do not seem to affect their failure probabilities. In the case of foreign owned \nfirms, this could be due to the fact that even if they display high debt and\/or low collateral, \nthese firms can always obtain funds from their parent company, which increases their \nprobability of survival. In the case of exporters, it could be due to the signalling effect that \nhaving paid the sunk export market entry costs, these firms must be sufficiently productive \nto generate enough profits in foreign markets to recover the sunk costs. This signalling \n                                                 \n20 The p-value associated with a \u03c72 test aimed at testing the hypothesis of whether the coefficients associated \nwith leverage (collateral) are equal at foreign and domestic firms is 0.0016 (0.00), suggesting that the \nhypothesis can be rejected. \n11\n effect is likely to attenuate the adverse effects of high levels of debt and\/or low levels of \ncollateral, therefore increasing these firms\u2019 chances of survival.  \n In all regressions, the coefficients associated with the time and industry dummies \n(not reported in the Table) are generally significant, indicating that business cycle and \nindustry-specific effects matter21. \n \n4.2 Robustness tests \nWe now check whether our results are robust to using a Cox proportional hazard model and \na rare-events Logit model in estimation; to controlling for unobserved heterogeneity; to \nincluding time dummies interacted with industry dummies; and to considering the two \ndimensions of global engagement (exporting and being foreign owned) separately. \n \nCox proportional hazard specification \nEstimating the hazard of exit using a Cox proportional hazard specification complements \nthe Logit specification as it models both the event of failure and the time it takes a firm to \nfail. Specifically, we estimate the determinants of the hazard of firm failure, \u03bbi(t), which \nrepresents the instantaneous rate at which firm i fails at time t given that it was \u2018alive\u2019 at \ntime t-1 using a proportional hazard model of the form: \n \n\u03bbi(t) = \u03bb0(t)exp(X\u2019it\u03b2)         (2) \n \nwhere \u03bb0(t) is the baseline hazard, and Xit\u2019 is a matrix of explanatory variables with \ncoefficients \u03b2, similar to those used in the Logit specification. Since we are not interested in \ninvestigating the underlying shape of the baseline hazard, but in understanding the effect \nfinancial and global engagement variables have on the firm\u2019s hazard of exit, Cox\u2019s (1972) \npartial likelihood approach provides a convenient way of estimating the parameters \u03b2 \n                                                 \n21 We also attempted a Logit specification, in which we included the leverage ratio, our measure of collateral, \nand the global engagement dummy as separate regressors. We found that the leverage ratio attracted a positive \nand strongly significant coefficient (0.222; standard error: 0.096), while collateral attracted a negative and \nprecisely determined coefficient (-1.021; standard error: 0.232). The coefficient associated with the global \nengagement dummy, on the other hand, was poorly determined (0.045; standard error: 0.136), suggesting that \nglobal engagement does not directly affect firms\u2019 survival probabilities. These results are not reported for \nbrevity, but are available upon request. \n12\n without having to specify a functional form for the baseline hazard, \u03bb0(t). This estimation \nmethod has been widely used in the literature on firm survival22. \nIn both Tables 3 and 4, column 2 reports the estimates of Equation (2)23. It should \nbe noted that, in this case, age could not be entered in the model directly, as it is collinear \nwith the baseline hazard. We have therefore replaced it with cohort dummies. The \ncoefficients on the latter (not reported for brevity) were, however, poorly determined. \nRegarding the other explanatory variables, the results are consistent with those reported in \nthe Logit specification in column 1 of both Tables. In particular, for both samples, we \nobserve a strong negative relationship between collateral and the exit hazard for domestic \nfirms, and a strong positive relationship between the leverage ratio and their exit hazard. A \nhigher collateral and a lower leverage ratio are therefore associated with a longer survival \ntime for domestic firms. In the full sample (Table 3), the financial variables also \nsignificantly affect the survival rates of the globally engaged firms, but their effects are \nalways smaller (in absolute value) than the corresponding effects for domestic firms. In \ncontrast, in the sample of newly established firms, globally engaged firms\u2019 survival times \nare not affected by financial variables (Table 4).  \n \nCorrecting for the biases induced by rare events \nSince the rate of firm failure in our analysis is small (1.77 percent in the full sample, and \n1.55 percent in the sample made up of newly established firms), it could potentially be \nclassified as a rare event. One consequence of this is that our Logit regression may \nunderestimate the probability of this rare event. We check whether our results are robust to \ncorrecting for this bias, using the procedures suggested in King and Zeng (2001a, 2001b) \nfor generating approximately unbiased and lower-variance estimates of Logit coefficients \nand their variance-covariance matrix correcting for rare events. Our corrected results, \nreported in column 3 of Tables 3 and 4, are similar to those outlined for the Logit \nspecification in column 124. This suggests that having a small rate of firm failure is not a \nsignificant source of bias. \n \n                                                 \n22 See for instance Mata et al. (1995); Audretsch and Mahmood (1995); Fotopolous and Louri (2000); Bernard \nand Sj\u00f6holm (2003); Disney et al. (2003); and Vartia (2004). \n23 In Tables 3 and 4, the slightly smaller number of observations in column 2 compared to column 1 is due to \nthe fact that the Cox proportional hazard model controls for ties, i.e. for observations with identical duration. \nAlso note that the estimates reported in column 2 of Table 3 are likely to suffer from the sample selection bias \ndue to the fact that those firms born and dissolved before the start of the sample are excluded. \n24 These results were obtained using the relogit command in Stata. \n13\n Correcting for unobserved heterogeneity \nAlthough all the models we have estimated so far include firm-specific covariates, it is \nunlikely that they can account for all observation-specific effects. Not taking proper \naccount of unobserved heterogeneity may bias the results and lead to misleading inferences \nbeing made about the effect the explanatory variables have on the likelihood of failure. \nColumn 4 of Tables 3 and 4 presents the results of a random-effects Logit model, which \ncontrols for unobserved effects25. We can see that the signs and significance of the \ncoefficients associated with the main variables included in our regression do not change \nonce unobserved heterogeneity is taken into account. Specifically, both our financial \nvariables only affect the survival probabilities of the domestic firms in the sample made up \nof newly established firms. On the other hand, in the full sample, they affect the survival \nprobabilities of both domestic and globally engaged firms, the effects for the former being \nalways larger.  \n \nIncluding time dummies interacted with industry dummies \nSince there could be shifts in expectations, which could affect firms\u2019 survival probabilities, \nand could be due to changes in industry-level conditions, such as industry demand shocks, \nor industry-wide technology changes (Carpenter and Petersen, 2002), in addition to the \nstandard time dummies defined at the aggregate level, which remove cyclical variation \ncommon to the entire economy, we check whether our results are robust to including time \ndummies interacted with industry dummies. These dummies are aimed at controlling for \nthose industry-specific shifts in expectations. The results are reported in column 5 of Tables \n3 and 4. Once again, we can see that the signs and significance of the coefficients \nassociated with the main variables included in our regression do not change. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n25 The random-effects Logit model requires that firm-specific unobserved effects are uncorrelated with the \nregressors, which might not be a plausible assumption in our context. Alternatively, one could use a \nconditional fixed effects Logit model (Chamberlain, 1980). An advantage of this method of estimation is that \nit allows the regressors and the firm-specific component of the error term to be correlated. However, a \ncontribution to the likelihood only arises from those groups of firms that exhibit a change in status (here, from \nalive to dead), and the group of firms that exhibit no change in status are discarded. In our case, this would \nmean a significant loss of observations, and require belief that all the information needed for estimation is \ncontained in the remaining data. Other disadvantages of the conditional Logit estimator are that only the time-\nvarying variables are included, and so the precision of those variables with negligible variance across time \nwould be compromised. \n14\n Considering the two dimensions of global engagement separately \nIn our analysis so far, we have considered a firm as being globally engaged if it exports \nand\/or is foreign owned: the two dimensions of global engagement were considered jointly. \nMotivated by our finding in Tables 1 and 2, according to which the higher proportion of \nglobally engaged firms found among the surviving group seems to be driven by the foreign \nowned dimension of global engagement, we now question whether our results also hold for \neach of the two dimensions individually. Column 6 of Tables 2 and 3 reports the pooled \nLogit estimates, where EXPORTit (a dummy variable equal to 1 if firm i exports at time t, \nand 0 otherwise) is used as our measure of global engagement. Specifically, the following \ninteraction terms are included: Leverageit*[1-EXPORTit]; Leverageit*[EXPORTit]; \nCollateralit*[1-EXPORTit]; Collateralit*[EXPORTit]. In column 7, the dummy FOREIGNi \n(equal to 1 if firm i is foreign-owned, and 0 otherwise) is used26, and the following \ninteraction terms are included: Leverageit*[1-FOREIGNi]; Leverageit*[FOREIGNi]; \nCollateralit*[1-FOREIGNi]; Collateralit*[FOREIGNi]. \nInterestingly, in column 6 of Table 4, which refers to the newly established firms, \nour measure of size no longer attracts a statistically significant coefficient. However, our \nprofitability measure does. These findings could arise because EXPORTit has a large \nnumber of missing values, making the sample size much smaller in column 6 compared to \nthe other columns. In both columns 6 and 7 of Table 4, it is evident that financial variables \nonly affect the survival probabilities of the domestic firms. Thus, for newly established \nfirms, our main result that global engagement shields firms from liquidity constraints also \nholds separately for the two dimensions of global engagement that we have considered27.  \nThe results are weaker for the full sample. Columns 6 of Table 3 shows in fact that \nwhen global engagement is measured in terms of participation to export markets, both \nfinancial variables exert an effect of similar magnitude at globally engaged and purely \ndomestic firms28. When global engagement is measured in terms of foreign ownership, on \nthe other hand, leverage only affects domestic firms, while collateral affects both (column 7 \nof Table 3). Although the coefficient on collateral is higher in absolute value for the foreign \n                                                 \n26 Note that, like Groupi, FOREIGNi is time-invariant. \n27 We also estimated specifications including EXPORTit \/ FOREIGNi as separate regressors, in addition to the \ninteraction terms. The global engagement dummies always attracted poorly determined coefficients. \nFurthermore, in order to determine whether the lack of time dimension in the FOREIGNi variable biases the \nresults, we have estimated our Equation in which FOREIGNi is used as our global engagement measure, \nbased on the last year available for each firm: our main results were unchanged. These estimates are not \nreported for brevity, but are available upon request. \n28 The p-value associated with a \u03c72 test aimed at assessing whether the impact of collateral is equal at foreign \nand domestic firms is in fact 0.409. The corresponding p-value for leverage is 0.645. \n15\n owned firms (-0.94) compared to the domestic ones (-0.69), the difference between the \ntwo coefficients is not statistically significant29. \n \n5. Conclusions \nWe have used a panel of newly established UK firms over the period 1997-2002 to study \nthe effects of financial variables on survival probabilities, differentiating firms into globally \nengaged and purely domestic. Specifically, we have estimated a Logit model for the \nprobability of firm failure augmented with financial variables, which were interacted with \ndummies indicating whether firms are globally engaged or purely domestic. We performed \nour estimations separately on our full sample of firms, and on a sub-sample made up of \nnewly established firms only. We found that, for domestic firms, lower collateral and \nhigher leverage always result in higher failure probabilities, while financial variables either \ndo not significantly affect the survival probabilities of globally engaged firms, or exert a \nsmaller impact on them. These results were robust to using a Cox proportional hazard \nmodel; to controlling for the potential biases induced by rare events and unobserved \nheterogeneity; and to including time dummies interacted with industry dummies. For newly \nestablished firms, they were also robust to considering the two dimensions of global \nengagement (exporting and being foreign owned) separately. We can conclude that, in the \nUK, global engagement affects firms\u2019 survival probabilities by shielding them from \nfinancial constraints. These findings may have policy relevance. They suggests that export \npromotion policies and policies providing incentives to Foreign Direct Investment could be \nhelpful, reducing the level of financial constraints faced by firms, and indirectly enhancing \ntheir survival probabilities. \n                                                 \n29 The p-value associated with a \u03c72 test aimed at assessing whether the impact of collateral is equal at foreign \nand domestic firms is in fact 0.210. \n16\n  \nAppendix: Data \n \nStructure of the unbalanced panel: full sample \n \n \nNumber of \nobservations \nper firm \n \nNumber \nof firms \n \nPercent \n1 7306 2.89 \n2 15954 6.30 \n3 23682 9.35 \n4 29748 11.75 \n5 44155 17.44 \n6 132306 52.26 \nTotal 253151 100.00 \n \nStructure of the unbalanced panel: newly established firms  \n \n \nNumber of \nobservations \nper firm \n \nNumber \nof firms \n \nPercent \n1 1797 6.44 \n2 4436 15.90 \n3 6627 23.55 \n4 6228 22.32 \n5 5110 18.32 \n6 3702 13.27 \nTotal 27900 100.00 \n \nTable A1 presents the variance-covariance matrix of the main variables used in our \nregressions.

Short-term debt includes the \nfollowing items: bank overdrafts, short-term group and director loans, hire purchase, \nleasing, and other short-term loans, but it is predominantly bank finance. \nCollateral: ratio of the firm\u2019s tangible assets to its total assets. \nEXPORT: dummy variable equal to 1 if the firm exports a positive amount. \nFOREIGN: dummy equal to 1 if the firm is foreign owned, and 0 otherwise. To be \nconsidered as foreign owned, the share of foreign ownership in a firm\u2019s equity must exceed \n24.99 percent.
