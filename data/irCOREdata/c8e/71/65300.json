The first is to critically explore definitions of \nplaying that have underpinned a great deal of research in children\u2019s geography. \nIn so doing I want to highlight some of the assumptions that various authors \nwithin geography have made (often implicitly) about the ontological status of \nplaying. This will in turn, lead me to work with, between and sometimes against \nthree authors who have tried to theorize playing. In following this route, I hope to \ncome to some tentative conclusions about the status of playing, which \nparadoxically will eschew any (strong) ontological commitment at all. This leads \nto my second objective, which is to explore four particular aspects of playing \u2013 \nembodiment, affect, objects and time-space \u2013 to examine how they are \ninterleaved with spaces and spacing. In necessarily situating this work within my \nresearch at Hilltop Primary School [1] in the summer of 2001, I hope to show that \ngeographical studies can contribute to definitions of playing as much as playing \ncan inflect certain notions of space. \n \nKeywords: playing, school, affect, embodiment, time-space, non-representational \ntheory. \n \nChild\u2019s Play? \n \nIn thinking about children and playing, it was a while before I realized that the two \nterms seem to coagulate together, and this seemed to happen without much \ncomment. For instance, the first thing you see when picking up a copy of \nchildren\u2019s geographies (Holloway & Valentine, 2000) is children playing on the \ncover. Many authors have contributed to the establishment of this link through \nthe very focus of their studies. This includes a number of articles which have \nbeen concerned with the provision and use of (often outdoor) play facilities, (see \nValentine & McKendrick, 1997; Built Environment, 1999). Other studies, closely \naligned with my own research here, have explored the actual practices of playing \n 2 \nin after-school clubs (Smith & Barker, 2000), public playgrounds (Gagen, 2000), \ncommercial leisure spaces (McKendrick et al, 2000) and third world rural \ncontexts (Punch, 2000). Indeed, my own research and this paper were based \nupon and continue to reinforce this subtle connection between playing and \nchildhood. \n \nThis common move to link playing and childhood contains a number of tacit \nagreements, which I would like to bring into the foreground. Firstly it presupposes \nthe connection between playing and childhood to be self evident, which is to say, \nthere is something called \u201echild\u201fs play\u201f, often thought of as separate from the ludic \nactivity of adults. James et al (1998) suggest that \u201ethe culture of childhood might \nbe seen in the linguistic and playgrounds games of children, a collective culture, \nenduring and separated off from the adult world\u201f (p.99). I believe that the self-\nevidence of this connection is something that could usefully be investigated and \nchallenged, and part of my focus here will be to gesture towards ways in which \nthis might be done. My working hypothesis will be that certain statements about \nplaying should be applicable to all people, rather than just limited to young \npeople. It is therefore crucial to my mind that any theorization of playing, such as \nthe one I hope to elaborate in this paper, must account for an activity which is \ndone by people of all ages. Such an argument seeks to obliquely engage with \nrecent work in children\u201fs geography, which has been debating the differences \nand connections between adults and children (Philo, 2003; Jones, 2003), and the \nblurred boundary between adulthood and childhood (Valentine, 2003). \n 3 \n \nThe second tacit agreement that underpins the studies mentioned earlier, is that \nplay is talked about only in so far as it has the potential to be liberating, usually in \nrespect to children\u201fs use of space. For example, Smith & Barker (2000) recount \nhow children negotiate play activities at an after-school club in order to re-gain \nsome degree of control over that particular aspect of their lives. In a similar vein, \nPunch (2000) explores how children in rural Bolivia \u201ecreate their own playspaces \naway from parental control\u201f (p.56). McKendrick et al (2000) interpret the growth \nof commercial play spaces as asserting \u201echildren\u201fs right to play space in parts of \nthe built environment which were hitherto perceived as almost exclusively adult \ndomains\u201f (p.101). Aitken (2001) uses play to elaborate upon children\u201fs rights to \njustice and a politics of difference. My argument here is that although playing \n(often when it resists commercialization), can be key to young people\u201fs abilities \nto secure rights to and control over space, this is only telling half the story. As we \nsee in Gagen\u201fs (2000) study of gender normalization in 19th century American \nplaygrounds, playing was not, and is not, separate from sedimented regimes of \npower-discourse. Or put another way, playing isn\u201ft all fun and games. \n  \nTo extend this point further, my third observation on the coalescence of \nchildhood and playing is that authors who have written about playing, to varying \ndegrees, assume that their readers know what playing is. Indeed, it almost \nseems stupid to raise this question. After all, we all know what playing is \u2026 don\u201ft \nwe? It is this assumption, key to many if not all studies of play, that I particularly \n 4 \nwant to work on in order to disrupt a little the processes by which playing is \nquietly becoming packaged in the ways described in the previous paragraph. In \norder to enact this disruption, I begin by exploring three approaches, each of \nwhich offers a different way \u2013 through psychoanalysis, discourse analysis and \nperformance studies - of defining play. Using the various insights of these three \napproaches, I wish to theorize certain aspects of play more fully, in order to upset \ncertain assumptions about playing. \n \nTransition Play \n \nThe first approach I wish to address is the work of psychoanalyst and \npsychotherapist Donald Winnicott (1971), which has greatly influenced the work \nof Stuart Aitken, the author who has done most to explore playing within \n(children\u201fs) geography. Winnicott, like myself, is concerned with \u201ethe lack of a \nuseful statement on the subject of play\u201f (1971, p.39). The appeal of his work \n(particularly to geographers) as he attempts to address precisely this concern, is \nthe way in which he explicitly links playing with space. Simply put, \u201eplaying has a \nplace and a time\u201f (p.41; original emphasis). The context of Winnicott\u201fs study is \nhis work in psychotherapy, and he uses play specifically in order to elucidate his \nnotion of transitional space, where a child develops a sense of self\/other through \nplaying. I should state clearly that my focus here is not on the broader arguments \nmade by Winnicott. I am only interested in those parts of his work, which either \ndirectly or indirectly provide the basis or support for his definition of play. To this \n 5 \nend, I read Winnicott as making three other useful statements about what play is, \nin addition to situating it in time and space. Firstly, he foregrounds the role and \nimportance of objects and object relations in playing performances. \u201e[P]lay \u2026 is \nalways on the theoretical line between the subjective and that which is objectively \nperceived\u201f (p.50). Secondly, he calls attention to the creative role that playing can \nfulfill, or in his words, \u201eplaying is an experience, always a creative experience\u201f \n(p.50). Finally, he acknowledges the practical extent of playing, or in his words \nthe fact that \u201eplaying is doing\u201f (p.41) Amanda Bingley (2003) provides one \nexample of the way in which these ideas can be used, in her case to explore the \nrelationship between landscape and self. \n \nHowever, despite critically accentuating context, objects, creativity and the \npractice of playing, there are some limitations to Winnicott\u201fs work when trying to \ndefine playing. His definition of playing is often restrictive, such that in suggesting \nthat playing is doing, Winnicott contrasts this \u201edoing\u201f with thinking and wishing, \nwhich is to say that he does not consider things such as day-dreaming as a form \nof play. He also maintains that playing is always creative, where creativity is \ndefined as an ability to shape external reality rather than be subjected to it. \nSubsequent work by Judith Butler, refracted through Gagen\u201fs (2000) study of \nAmerican playgrounds, has shown that playing can be as much a process for \nsubjection as for creativity, to use Winnicott\u201fs own terms. Finally, although \naccentuating the role of objects, Winnicott\u201fs is still unwilling to cede any agency \nto objects themselves. As Kingsbury (2003) shows with the example of a couch \n 6 \nacting in the capacity of a mother and pillows which stand for breasts, objects \nonly achieve agency on an Imaginary level, rather than being treated as agents \nin their own right, i.e. pillows acting in their capacity as pillows (c.f. Latour, 1993).  \n \nUnderlying all of these criticisms, there is perhaps a more significant problem \nwith the theory of play we encounter in Winnicott\u201fs scholarship. His definition \nbecomes too bounded by his context, which is to say, his work provides a \ndefinition of playing as developmental. Winnicott\u201fs focus of course, is entirely \npractical, and his use of play is secondary to its uses in psychotherapy. However, \nin Playing and Reality, Winnicott suggests that \u201ethere is a direct development \nfrom transitional phenomena to playing, and from playing to shared playing, and \nfrom this to cultural experiences\u201f (1971, p.40). Playing is explicitly defined as a \ndevelopmental activity, whether done by children or adults. Brian Sutton-Smith \n(1997) terms this a rhetoric of play-as-progress. Playing is conceptualized as an \nactivity which helps people grow intellectually, and\/or develop a sense of self. \nWinnicott\u201fs definition of playing, implicitly defines children and adults in \npsychotherapy as less-than-adult, a definition geographers have been keen to \nmove beyond (Holloway & Valentine, 2000). When faced with the challenge of \narticulating what playing might look like in a non-therapeutic environment, \nWinnicott\u201fs response, literally \u201ewhatever I say about children playing really applies \nto adults as well\u201f (p.40), deflects, rather than answers the question. \n \n 7 \nLet me pause for a moment to clarify my argument. I am not arguing that playing \nis not an important part of the development process (to the extent that we are \nalways \u201edeveloping\u201f and this is understood in a non-teleological manner much \nmore akin to emergence) [2]. However, I am suggesting that definitions of playing \ncannot be reduced to processes of development which are effects of certain \nforms of playing, (and not playing itself). Perhaps Brian Sutton-Smith expresses \nthis idea more eloquently when he says \n \nA play theory of any comprehensiveness must grasp this strange \ncompanionship of the very young and the very old, the first waiting to \nbegin and the second to finish; \u2026 and such a theory must account also for \nthe invigorated play of soldiers waiting for battle, or the intensive play of \nBoccaccio\u201fs youthful fourteenth century folk attempting to outlast the Black \nPlague. In all these cases play seems to have more to do with waiting \nthan with preparing, more to do with boredom than with rehearsal, more to \ndo with keeping up one\u201fs spirits than with depression (1997, p.48). \n \nWith these criticisms in mind, I wish to turn now to Stuart Aitken\u201fs work to \nexamine how he as incorporated Winnicott\u201fs insights. Aitken is keen to explore \nthe potential for playing to transform the relations of social reproduction, and is \ncareful to jettison much of the developmental rhetoric that surrounds Winnicott\u201fs \ndefinition of play. For Aitken only certain forms of playing have the potential to \nenact this social transformation. He suggests that \u201eplay \u2026 does not fit well in the \n 8 \nrational, instrumental logic that pervades the abstract conceived spaces of \ntoday\u201fs world\u201f (p.180) [3]. Hence, \u201e[P]lay, at its most radical and important, is as a \nform of resistance\u201f (2001, p.180). This ideal type of play, according to Aitken, is \nboth non-commercial and done in private (thick play). This leads to his claim that \n\u201egiving young people space is more than giving them room to play, it is giving \nthem the opportunity for unchallenged and critical reflection on experiences\u201f \n(p.180). While, as Thomas (2002) opines, it may be difficult to locate such private \nspaces for play, Aitken effectively highlights the critical and ethical potential of \nplay. In this scenario, play is most clearly defined as \u201ethe active exploration of \nindividual and social imaginaries, built up in the spaces of everyday life\u201f (p.176). \nHowever, I want to suggest that many playing performances have far more \ncontingent and diverse contexts and outcomes. This is not to work against the \ntenor of Aitken\u201fs work, but to suggest that there are many other avenues which \nmight be traveled. Hence, in trying to disrupt this conceptual ghettoization of \nplaying a little, I turn now to the work of play theorist Brian Sutton-Smith (1997), \nwhich has also tried to account for many different approaches to play. \n \nRhetorics of Play \n \nSutton-Smith\u201fs book, The Ambiguity of Play, is based on the premise that \u201ewhen \nit comes to making theoretical statements about what play is \u2026 there is little \nagreement among us, and much ambiguity\u201f (1997, p.1). Therefore, rather than \nbeginning with a definition of play, Sutton-Smith adopts a more genealogical \n 9 \napproach by proceeding to examine several different rhetorics of play, the \nculturally situated discourses that underlie different theories of play. In his third \nchapter he turns his attentions to the rhetoric of child\u201fs play as progress, \nexemplified in Winnicott\u201fs work. However, his prognosis is bleak. While never \nrejecting the play-as-progress discourse outright, Sutton-Smith states that \n\u201eevidence does not seem to support very clear causal relationships\u201f (1997, p.42) \nbetween playing and development, where correlation is often mistaken for \ncausation. He then goes on to suggest that \u201ethe progress rhetoric appears to \nserve adult needs rather than the needs of children\u201f (Ibid), by facilitating adults\u201f \nintervention and manipulation of children\u201fs (playful) lives. \n \nSutton-Smith also explores two other discourses of play specifically in relation to \nchildren. The first of these investigations examines power and identity in the play \nof children, and he suggests that  \n \nThe adult public transcript is to make children progress, the adult private \ntranscript is to deny their sexual and aggressive impulses; the child public \ntranscript is to be successful as family members and schoolchildren, and \ntheir private or hidden transcript is their play life, in which they can express \nboth their special identity and their resentment at being a captive \npopulation (1997, p.123). \n \n 10 \nHowever, while some playing performances are a result of this \u201eresentment\u201f, the \nlink between playing and some authentic, special or private identity ignores the \nextent to which playing is part of everyday life, and not some discrete block of \nexperience. That is another way of saying that identities are not fixed, and nor is \nthere some core or \u201especial\u201f identity, which certain (playing) practices can \nproduce outside relations of power (c.f. Aitken, 2001).  \n \nSutton-Smith also examines the phantasmagorical rhetoric of playing, which \nexplores the potential of imaginary play by children. This chapter offers a number \nof important nuances for theorizing playing, not least that playing has the \npotential to be both rational and\/or irrational. Sutton-Smith also points out that \n\u201ethe adult imaginary rhetoric when applied to children tends to overemphasize the \ncreative and innovative qualities of their play at the expense of both the \ncontraries, the phantasmagorical and the ritualistic\u201f (p.171). His point is that \nplaying is \u201erooted in ritual as much as in innovation\u201f (Ibid. c.f. Gagen, 2000), and \nthat this applies as much for adult play as it does for child\u201fs play. \n \nOnce Sutton-Smith has covered the different rhetorics of play, he (re)turns his \nattentions in a final chapter that is somewhat at odds with the rest of the book, to \narticulating a definition of play (again) which incorporates all of these rhetorics. \nHis clearest and most unequivocal statement defines \u201eplay as a facsimilization of \nthe struggle for survival\u201f, where \u201ethe primary motive of the players is the stylized \nperformance of existential themes that mimic or mock the uncertainties and risks \n 11 \nof survival\u201f (1997, p.231). In this conclusion, not only is his account biologically \ndeterministic, but, as he himself admits, \u201edespite my extensive criticism of the \nrhetoric of progress, I have now invented yet another form of it\u201f (Ibid). While \nbeing a very useful theoretical resource for anyone interested in playing, Sutton-\nSmith\u201fs book in the end fails to provide a more nuanced theory of playing than \nthose he writes about and critiques. Perhaps the primary reason for this is that \nhis study begins with discourse, ignoring the fact that playing is, irreducibly, a \npractice. It is these lived, experiential aspects of play that are constantly \nexceeding the confines of discourse, which finds no real place in his thesis. \nHowever, it is precisely this aspect that we have to address, if we are to nuance \nour understandings and discussions of playing, and so I turn now to a third \napproach to defining play. \n \nPlaying Performances \n \nAs any person who plays knows, there is always part of that practice which \ncannot be described directly. Something elusive, embodied at both a physical \nand emotional level. While the task of writing about that which exceeds \nrepresentation may at first seem impossible, the discipline of Performance \nStudies, with its focus on embodiment and emotion can provide valuable \ntheoretical resources for incorporating practices into our accounts [4]. Richard \nSchechner in particular, has developed a very intriguing theory of play. \n \n 12 \nSchechner (1993) begins his discussion of play by stating his preference for a \nconcept of playing, as opposed to play: \u201ea continuous bending, twisting, and \nlooping of \u2026 that for which I can find no appropriate name, so \u201caction\u201d will have \nto do\u201f (p.39, ellipsis in original). There are a number of important points to unpack \nin such a short definition. Firstly, Schechner is keen to suggest that there is no \ndiscrete event called play, as such, but rather a far more fluid and polymorphous \nprocess called playing. This emphasis on playing as a process is an important \nshift from fixed to more fluid notions of practice. However, I would argue that it \nstill confines playing to one temporal rhythm, that of continuity. If events operate \nat a number of different rhythms and are far more mobile and permeable than \nSchechner\u201fs allows for, then playing becomes something which can occur across \nmultiple temporalities and rhythms. That is to say, playing can sometimes be a \ncontinuous, bending, looping twisting \u201eaction\u201f, but on other occasions it can also \nhave a very abrupt beginning and\/or end. As Winnicott said, playing has a time \nand a place, and it is important to recognize that both place and time can vary. In \nfact Schechner too is aware of this and suggests that: \u201eif one needs a metaphor \nto localize and (temporarily) stabilize playing \u2026 \u201cNet\u201d is better: a porous, flexible \ngatherer; a three-dimensional, dynamic, flow-through container\u201f (1993, p.41). \nWhile this metaphor promotes, in my reading, fluidity over stability, it still \nencompasses a sense of context which is dynamic, which is to say it allows for \nplaying performances to occur across different temporal rhythms and spatial \nformations, (if one can imagine a net that can become as rigid as a cage).  \n \n 13 \nHowever, what Schechner\u201fs net metaphor perhaps doesn\u201ft incorporate is the \npotential for playing to be creative in regards to time and space. That is to say, a \nnet is still a container of sorts, whereas many geographers have already \nhighlighted the potential for playing to create time and space, as well as take \nplace in it (e.g. Punch, 2000; Aitken, 2001). While I fully support the recognition \nof the creative potential of playing, which we have already noted in Winnicott\u201fs \ndefinition, I do not wish to exaggerate this potential. As Gagen (2000) adeptly \nshows us, playing can more often than not be used to reinforce existing spatio-\ntemporal relations and sediment existing power relations. Indeed, we might infer \nfrom Gagen\u201fs engagement with Judith Butler, that just as most gender \nperformances are enacted to stabilize gender norms, many playing performances \nalso work to normalize playing spaces (and times). However, as Butler notes in \nregards to gender, these performances never achieve the ideal. Hence it is \nimportant to consider to what extent actual playing performances live up to the \nnorm, and to what extent they refuse and exceed it. In practice, creativity is \nparticularly slippery to grasp, as some of my playing performance examples \nshow later in the paper. More often than not the spatio-temporal creativity of \nplaying created fleeting time-spaces, which were subsumed into other time-\nspaces as quickly as they were created. \n \nTo return to Schechner\u201fs description of playing as an \u201eaction\u201f, the second point to \nnote is that it is very vague. In fact, it hardly tells us anything at all about what \nplaying is. However, rather than immediately dismissing such a description as \n 14 \nrelatively useless, I want to entertain the notion that Schechner in fact wishes to \neschew any (strong) ontological base for playing. That is to say, when confronted \nwith the question, what is playing, rather than (attempt to) answer it, Schechner\u201fs \ndefinition destabilizes the very question itself. In thinking about \u201ebending, twisting \nand looping\u201f, I am suggesting that playing has more to do with becoming rather \nthan being. Playing has no identity (being) itself, except as a secondary \ncharacteristic of its conceptual differentiation (becoming) \u2013 the identity of \ndifference. We can see this identity in difference, (or the becoming of playing) in \nSutton-Smith\u201fs discussion of rhetorics of play, all of which are about playing, but \nnone of which (either on there own or cumulatively) can provide a definitive \nstatement about what play is. This is why, in my reading, Schechner describes \nplaying as \u201eaction\u201f, because it is only in the performance of playing, when it is \nenacted in a particular space-time (the being of becoming), that we can actually \ndefine playing (fleetingly). If playing does have an identity (an ontological base), it \nis a weak and unstable one, at every moment prone to another becoming (or \nbecoming-other, see Deleuze and Guattari, 1988, esp. chapter 10). Schechner \nelaborates on this when he asserts, \n \nWe need to stop looking so hard at play, or play genres, and investigate \nplaying, the ongoing, underlying process of off-balancing, loosening, \nbending, twisting, reconfiguring, and transforming - the permeating, \neruptive\/disruptive energy and mood below, behind and to the side of \n 15 \nfocused attention. (Why not \u201eabove\u201f? I really don\u201ft know, it\u201fs probably just \ncultural prejudice) (p43). \n  \nLet me pause for a moment to briefly summarize and slightly extend this \nargument, since it is crucial to the understanding of playing I wish to pursue in \nthe rest of this paper. In reading Schechner, I am suggesting that playing occurs \nat the intersection of being and becoming. It has no identity (being), except as a \nsecondary characteristic of its ontological difference (becoming). Therefore, we \nmust shift our attention away from pursuing playing in its being, or in other words, \ntrying to offer some kind of definition of what playing is, and instead investigate \nplaying in its becoming. However, this is a self defeating enterprise, since any \nattempt to \u201epin down\u201f difference, will necessarily impose an identity on this \ndifference, thus transforming the becoming into a being once again. Therefore, \nwe must work at the intersection of being and becoming, and try to write \nalongside playing as difference, without trying to inhabit it. This requires, as \nSchechner notes, a focus on the situated \u201eaction\u201f or performances of playing, \nwhich returns us once again to the intersection of representation and that which \nexceeds it with which we began this section. \n \nSo what can we say about the performance of playing. I have already highlighted \nthe potential of Schechner\u201fs vague definition for destabilizing the ontological \nbase of playing. I have also discussed the importance of a temporal and spatial \ncontext, or \u201enet\u201f as Schechner would have it, to discussions of playing. We can \n 16 \nsay that this \u201enet\u201f functions as a marker of the being\/becoming intersection of \nplaying, which is why any discussion of playing must always fold into a particular \nspace-time. However, Schechner\u201fs vague definition also has its limitations when \nit comes to writing alongside the becoming of playing, or in other words providing \nus with something more concrete to work with than just \u201eaction\u201f. Hence, it is this \nterm \u201eaction\u201f that I wish to unpack, to provide a more sustained account of what \ngoes into each performance of playing, or each being that accompanies the \nbecoming of playing. Therefore, rather than define playing as such, I wish to \ntheorize certain aspects of play more fully within the loose definitional context I \nhave outlined above. In using the term theorizing, I have in mind a process more \nakin to a conversation than a question and answer session, where conclusions \nare eschewed in favour of continued (theoretical and empirical) discussions in \nthe future. In order to theorize playing, as I have argued above, it is necessary to \nexplore some of my own playing performances in Hilltop Primary School (see \nnote [1]), Bristol in the summer of 2001.  \n \nThe research which I will draw on, involved conducting a performance \nethnography in an inner-city primary school (5-11 years old) with just over 300 \npupils. My performance ethnography involved, in a peculiar form, going back to \nschool. Arriving at 8:30am, when most of the children did, and leaving at 3:30pm, \nI followed the routine of various classes as they went about their daily business. \nHowever, unlike them, I spent each day focusing my attention on anything that \nfelt like playing. And felt here is significant, because performance ethnography \n 17 \naims to use all the senses, rather than just the verbal or visual. In order to record \nand share these experiences, I made a research diary, in which I tried to evoke \nthe various playing moments as I experienced them. In writing these moments, \nmy aim was not to re-present them as such, but rather in trying to evoke them, \ngesture towards what did not make it on the page. I also want to use these \nempirical vignettes as concrete examples of playing, in order to explore the role \nof embodiment, affect, objects and time-space in playing performances. \n \nEmbodied Playing \n \nAfter registration, Mrs R. [5] begins a lesson on spelling. The reception \nclass are all sat cross-legged on the blue carpet facing the whiteboard. \nThey are somewhat restless, due to the heavy rain outside the window. \nMrs R. says a word, then chooses someone to write the spelling on the \nwhiteboard. While this is going on, a boy is constantly pulling the back of \nmy chair, levering himself up to get a better view. I notice another boy at \nthe back of the classroom trying to squash himself into a cupboard. \u201eWho \ncan spell d-o-c-t-o-r?\u201f asks Mrs R. Immediately a flurry of hands dart up \ninto the air. A few mute cries of \u201eme, me\u201f are whispered. A girl is chosen. \nShe gives a quick triumphant glance at the boy next to her, before \nstanding up and writing the word correctly on the board. When she returns \nto her place, the boy next to her sticks his tongue out. He then keeps \npoking her in the ribs, until she lets out a cry. Mrs R., who has been \n 18 \ndiscretely monitoring this, sends the boy to the red carpet. The boy looks \nlongingly over at the rest of the class for a while, before playing with an \nenvelope as if it were a glove. Back on the blue carpet, the boy who was \ntrying to squash himself into a cupboard is now playing with a toy truck \n(Research Diary \u2013 Reception Class, July 2001). \n \nThe first thing that anyone will notice when doing research on playing, just as I \ndid on my first day at Hilltop (described above), is that all playing performances \nare embodied. That is to say playing involves sights, sounds, smells, touch and \ntastes to varying degrees. This is hardly a revelation and there is also now a vast \nliterature on embodiment within geography, which Aitken (2001) deftly channels \ninto his discussion of children\u201fs bodies in his chapter on \u201eLearning through the \nbody\u201f. However, in many of the accounts Aitken discusses, and also in many of \nthe accounts of playing that I have reviewed so far in this paper, part of the \nmateriality of bodies is omitted from the picture. Alan Radley (1995) puts it nicely \nwhen he states,  \n \nThe confusion lies in the equation of the epistemological determination of \nsocial life as discursive with the ontological status of the body; or put \nanother way, the refusal to acknowledge as different that which cannot \nreadily be put into words. There is good reason, therefore, to distinguish \nthe discursive form of society from the social constructivist perspective. \nOnce this is done, it becomes possible to consider an alternative \n 19 \nstandpoint, one that does not deny that the body has been subjected to \ncontrols within power\/discourse, but takes a different perspective on that \nprocess (p21; emphasis in original). \n \nIn other words, while bodies do signify such things as gender, race, age and \nability, which have very important material consequences, the materiality of \nbodies also exceeds representation (See Foucault, 1998). It is particularly \nimportant to consider the consequences of this excess in relation to our \nepistemological practices. As Geraldine Pratt puts it, \u201eour actual research \nperformances, the now of research, goes largely un(re)marked, even though they \nclearly exceed the written trace\u201f (2000, p.650; original emphasis). In thinking and \nwriting about the embodied nature of playing therefore, we must be attentive not \nonly to the body-as-signifier, but also to the ways in which the representationally \nexcessive aspects of corporeality work. This is particularly important because, as \nI will gesture towards later, it is often what is in excess of signification that comes \nto fore in many (but not all) playing performances [6]. \n \nPlaying with affects \n \nAfter morning break, the science lesson begins. The pupils sit in groups of \nsix, which I find out later have been allocated according to ability. On each \ntable, the girls sit on one side and the boys on the other. There is a list of \ntasks to be completed, written on the board, since different people have \n 20 \ncompleted different things. I am sitting at a table in the middle of the \nclassroom. Although there is talking, the pupils seem to be working \ndiligently, whilst the teacher moves around helping those who are \nstruggling. After a while, the boy sitting diagonally behind me, turns \naround and gently hits the girl sitting next to me on the back. She \nimmediately suspects him (he has a reputation of being class joker), and \ntells him not to do it, without saying it so loud that the teacher hears. I \nkeep an eye on him now, and he soon turns around again, gives me a \ncomplicit glance and gently hits her again. The girl turns and confronts him, \nand in his defense he blames the boy sitting next to him. A short argument \nwith his neighbor follows, before he begins to (not so gently) hit his \nneighbor as punishment for supposedly hitting the girl. All the time this is \nhappening, the girl is watching, and all three are smiling (Research Diary \u2013 \nYear 4 class, July 2001). \n \nIn the above account there are a number of examples of ways in which bodies \nrepresent certain processes (the gendered spatial formation of the classroom for \ninstance). However, in offering this moment from my research, I wish to address \nthe challenge of finding ways of talking about the playing performance (or \u201eaction\u201f) \nthat my research diary cannot represent. I have already suggested in the \nprevious section that in part, the materiality or physicality of a body exceeds \nrepresentation. Now I want to look at how the emotional aspects of a body are \nalso non-representable. I think this is important, because it is precisely these \n 21 \naspects that many people value in their playing experiences. A number of \ntheorists from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds have also begun to \naddress similar questions, and the name they have given to this embodied \nrepresentational excess is affect. As Brian Massumi points outs, \n \nAffect is most often used loosely as a synonym for emotion. But one of the \nclearest lessons \u2026 is that emotion and affect \u2013 if affect is intensity \u2013 follow \ndifferent logics and pertain to different orders. An emotion is a subjective \ncontent, the sociolinguistic fixing of the quality of an experience which is \nfrom that point onward defined as personal. Emotion is qualified intensity, \nthe conventional, consensual point of insertion of intensity into \nsemantically and semiotically formed progressions, into narrativizable \naction-reaction circuits, into function and meaning. It is intensity owned \nand recognized (Massumi, 2002, p.27-8). \n \nSo if affect exceeds representation, and it is not emotion, then how exactly do we \nthink and write about it? Building on his previous point, where \u201eaffect is intensity\u201f, \nMassumi suggests \n \nThe realm of intensity \u2026 is transcendental in the sense that it is not \ndirectly accessible to experience, it is not transcendent, it is not exactly \noutside experience either. It is immanent to it \u2013 always in it but not of it. \nIntensity and experience accompany one another, like two mutually \n 22 \npresupposing dimensions, or like two sides of a coin. Intensity is \nimmanent to matter and events, to mind and body and to every level of \nbifurcation composing them and which they compose. Thus it also cannot \nbut be experienced, in effect \u2013 in proliferations of levels of organization it \nceaselessly gives rise to, generates and regenerates, at every suspended \nmoment (2002, p.33) [7]. \n \nThis is to say that affect can be gauged in its effects. William Connolly, in his \nlatest book Neuropolitics, explores this link between emotion and intensity further. \nIn the following statement, he provides some concrete ways of thinking about the \nproducts of affect. \n \nPart of the affective energy mixed into thought becomes available to \nconsciousness as feelings and concept-imbued emotions; but other \nthought imbued energies find symptomatic expression in the timbre of our \nvoices, the calmness or intensity of our gestures, our facial expressions, \nthe flush of our faces, the rate of our heartbeats, the receptivity, tightness, \nor sweatiness of our skin, and the relaxation or turmoil in our guts \n(Connolly, 2002, p.76). \n \nThe \u201ecomplicit glance\u201f of the boy in the Year 4 class is one way in which affect \ncould be gauged, as could the way in which he hit both the girl and the other boy \nwithout hurting them (much). The subtly of this gesture \u2013 the way in which he hit \n 23 \nthem only so hard \u2013 was not something I cognitively recognized, but rather \u201efelt\u201f. \nIt is important to note that in my discussion so far affect could be reduced to the \nlevel of personal feelings and emotions. However, Massumi (2002) is quick to \npoint to the contrary that affect \u201eis not ownable or recognizable\u201f (p.28), but \n\u201einseparable from but unassimilable to any particular, functionally anchored \nperspective\u201f (p.35; original emphasis). \n \nHence, affect can be thought of as flowing between bodies and is thus inter-\nsubjective, or better still a-subjective, since it \u201eescapes\u201f actually existing structure \nthings. We have probably all at some stage experienced the rather clich\u00e9 \u201ewave \nof fear\u201f or \u201emummer of delight\u201f when in a crowd situation, which are both \u201ethe \ncapture and closure\u201f or the result of a particular affect or intensity. In my playing \nmoment during the Year 4 Science lesson, we could say that a mischievously \njoyful affect (briefly) flowed through the children and me. None of us \u201eowned\u201f this \nfeeling, nor was it located \u201ein\u201f any of us. Yet it was crucial to our enactment of \nthat particular moment. \n \nTo briefly summarize, I am arguing that any definition of playing or embodiment \nthat does not consider affect, ignores a vital part of what allows us to get on with \nour daily lives. Indeed, in weaving together scholarship on brain research, \ncinema, politics and culture, Connolly (2002) argues that affect is as important to \nthinking and judgement, as it is to feelings. But even beyond this, I am arguing \nthat it is vital to consider affect because in many (but not all) playing \n 24 \nperformances, it is the affective register that becomes heightened. Playing is not \nthoughtless as such, but rather in many instances, prioritizes non-cognitive \n(physical and emotional) processes, such as the playing moment in Year 4 \nScience. However, it is important to remember that these processes are \nthemselves not altogether separate from cognitive thinking. Hence, while authors \nsuch as Aitken & Herman (1997) suggest that playing \u201ecounters rationality\u201f, I \nwould suggest instead that many (but not all) playing performances, rather than \ncountering rationality, allow a greater role for the non-cognitive (and therefore \nseemingly irrational) parts of the brain (Connolly, 2002) [8]. \n \nPlaying with different bodies \n \n\u201eMy pencil case is called Gibbles. And my rubbers also got a name. \nGidney. He\u201fs cross and he\u201fs got big sharp teeth\u201f (Girl, aged 9). \u201eGidney\u201f, \nan object invested with emotions, is then passed around the table as the \nyoung people argue somewhat fiercely over who will hold him. The girl \nwho \u201eowns\u201f the rubber has the final say in what he can and cannot do \n(Research Diary \u2013 Year 4 class, July 2001). \n \nIt is at this juncture, as I move on to this next research moment, that I want to \nreopen the case file on the role of objects in playing mentioned earlier. I want to \nbegin by considering the impact of this moment, in which objects are vital to the \nplaying performance, to what I have so far said about theorizing playing. I have \n 25 \nsuggested that affects, since they are asubjective, exceed even a broad \ndefinition of what we regard as human [9]. Indeed Deleuze & Guattari maintain \nthat \n \n[A]ffects are beings whose validity lies in themselves and exceeds any \nlived. They could be said to exist in the absence of man because man, as \nhe is caught in stone, on the canvas, or by words, is himself a compound \nof percepts and affects (1994, p.164). \n \nSo affects can flow through objects just as they flow through humans. However, I \nhave also suggested that playing is an embodied experience. Therefore, if we \nare to take seriously the role of non-humans in playing performances, then we \nneed a reworked notion of embodiment, as far as this is understood in human \nterms. In order to address this challenge I wish to turn to the work of Gilles \nDeleuze. \n \nDeleuze presents us with a very different conception of the body from the \nimplicitly human body which I have been referring to thus far. Following Spinoza, \nDeleuze (1988) defines the individuality of a body in two ways: firstly by the \nrelations of motion and rest, and secondly by its capacity for affecting and being \naffected. It is important to consider carefully exactly what Deleuze is getting at \nhere. Firstly, both of these definitions are dynamic. Bodies never have stable \nidentities, but rather are always prone to other becomings. [10] Thus, according \n 26 \nto Deleuze, even stasis is viewed as a form of relative motion [11]. While Gibbles \nand Gidney were a pencil case and rubber when I first encountered them, they \nquickly became animated beings, and in this text perhaps they are now a hybrid \nof the two. Secondly, both of these definitions are relational. Therefore, \nsomewhat paradoxically, a body\u201fs individuality is never as an individual. That is \nto say that because bodies, as I have just noted, are always more or less mobile, \nthen they are never entirely separable from other bodies. In fact, Deleuze argues \nthat \u201ea body, however small it may be, is composed of an infinite number of \nparticles [other bodies]\u201f (1988, p.123) [12]. Although difficult to actually perceive \nin the playing moment, Gibbles and Gidney were constructed by other physical \nbodies (e.g. hands, the desk), and social bodies (the discussion that took place, \nbroader ideas about the use of rubbers). We might think of the individuality of the \nbody then as its being, or a temporary representation that the body nevertheless \neludes (again) in its becoming-other. Perhaps thinking of the body\u201fs individuality \nas a trace or wraith, gives a better sense of what I mean when I describe \nindividuality as partial. Thirdly, the role of affect is highlighted as key in defining \nbodies. The arguments over Gidney give some idea of the ways in which bodies \ncan modify and be modified by the affective charge of a situation, creating an \naggressive playing environment in this situation. I mention the role of affect not \nonly to re-iterate that it is asubjective (i.e. belongs to no body in particular), but \nalso to restate that affect is woven into thinking and judgement (Connolly, 2002), \nand hence the capacity for affecting and being affected can involve a wide variety \nof cognitive as well as sensual apparatus. While the arguments over Gidney \n 27 \nwere passionate, they were also to a certain extent logical \u2013 the \u201eowner\u201f always \nhaving the final \u201esay\u201f. \n \nThe importance of the above discussion to my thesis is expressed far more \nconcisely by Deleuze when he states, \u201ea body can be anything; it can be an \nanimal, a body of sounds, a mind or an idea; it can be a linguistic corpus, a social \nbody, a collectivity\u201f (Deleuze, 1988, p.127). Thus, Deleuze\u201fs ontology of \u201ethe \nbody\u201f is an opening up, which incorporates the non-human (\u201ean animal\u201f), the non-\nmaterial (\u201ea body of sounds\u201f), the non-representable (\u201ean idea\u201f) and multiplicities \n(\u201ea social body\u201f). Deleuzian bodies are at once material, semiotic, social and \nincorporeal, as indeed bodies are when encountered in our everyday (playful) \nlives. I also note that for Deleuze, all bodies are conceptually equal, and thus his \ndefinition shies away from using the human\/non-human definitional pairing, which \nstill has human at its core. It is for these reasons that I wish to use a Deleuzian \nnotion of bodies when thinking about playing. As I have suggested above, \nplaying is irreducibly an embodied activity. To ignore the contingent role that \nobjects, sounds, ideas and socio-cultural habits have on playing performances is \nto ignore the specificity and complexity of these performances (or to ignore the \nbecoming of playing). The bodies of \u201eGibbles\u201f and \u201eGidney\u201f are as vital to the \nplaying performance I just mentioned, as any of the \u201ehuman\u201f bodies present. In \nfact, this diary extract doesn\u201ft even mention the school building, the curriculum, \nthe class rules or a host of other bodies that co-constituted playing in this \nparticular context. Thus, I argue that a Deleuzian inspired notion of em-bodi-ment \n 28 \nallows a much broader consideration of what (or which bodies) co-constitute \ndifferent playing performances. \n \nPlaying with\/in time-space \n \nAs I outlined when discussing Schechner\u201fs work, a consideration of space-times \nenfolded into various playing performances is vital to theorizing playing. Such a \nconsideration is particularly important because playing has the potential to create \nnew spaces. Playing performances erupted everywhere while I was at Hilltop, \nand confining my study to the playground would have been totally insufficient. In \nthis respect, my research resonates with Punch\u201fs (2000) account of children\u201fs \nplaying experiences. Having said that, a great number of the playing \nperformances I witnessed did occur in the playground. The point I am making is \nthat while some playing practices can be spatially fluid and creative, other \nperformances most definitely aren\u201ft, and serve to normalize tightly defined (and \npoliced) spaces of play.  \n \nThe same is true when thinking about playing temporally, which was brought \nsharply into focus at the end of one break time. The year 5 class that I had joined \nthat day continued to argue and \u201emuck about\u201f for a good 10 minutes after the \nofficial end of break time, and this continued as they climbed the stairs and sat \ndown for lessons. However, the year 4 class I had joined the previous week left \nthe playground very promptly in an \u201eorderly\u201f line. Reducing playing to a tightly \n 29 \ndemarcated spatio-temporal practice would be as insufficient as only stressing its \nfluidity and porosity. Neither account allows for the different spatial and temporal \npatterns and rhythms of playing, which always occurs between the two \nconceptual limit cases (fixed\/static) which are only conceived after the event.  \n \nPlaying with conclusions \n \nSo let me summarize now the main points I have made about playing. Firstly I \nhave suggested that playing occurs at the intersection of being and becoming, \nwhich is to say that playing doesn\u201ft have a stable identity as such. It is only in \nspecific time-space contexts that playing acquires a specific form, (the much \ncited work of Opie and Opie (1969) provides a comprehensive overview of many \n\u201eforms\u201f of playing), and function (and this is where I see Winnicott\u201fs work fitting in). \nHowever, as Sutton-Smith\u201fs (1997) study shows, any attempt to define playing in \nits being, using either its form or function, will be theoretically limited. I am \nsuggesting that if we are to theorize playing, then we must work to incorporate its \nbecoming into our accounts, or what Schechner describes as \u201eaction\u201f. I then \nelaborated on Schechner\u201fs term \u201eaction\u201f, by suggesting that playing in its \nbecoming is always embodied, using Deleuze\u201fs philosophy to vastly expand the \nterrain of what counts as a body and thus what contributes to different playing \nperformances. I have also drawn attention to affect, since it is not only a key \naspect in many playing performances, but also remains largely unremarked upon \nin our research accounts. I am not suggesting however, that the ways in which \n 30 \nvarious bodies signify (certain identities) are not also constitutive of playing \nperformances, merely that affect plays an important, and so far overlooked role in \nembodied playing. However, I do not wish to suggest that by incorporating the \ninsights of a range of non-representational theories we will suddenly have the \nanecdote to overcoming partial and situated accounts. While I am offering an \nexpansion of the terrain on which we work upon, this terrain will still always have \ngaps and fissures (Rose, 1997). Finally, I have suggested that playing is both \nconstitutive of and performed within a range of space-times. While playing has \nthe potential to be(come) spatially and temporally creative, I have warned against \neasy identifications between playing and spatial (and temporal) autonomy, \nsuggesting instead that many playing performances in fact can act to normalize \nspaces and bodies. \n \nFollowing this discussion, I would like to draw a few tentative conclusions around \nplaying. Firstly, in theorising playing, I would suggest we must be modest. All \nattempts to give a definition have so far failed because they always partake of \nexclusions which are empirically contradicted. This was brought home to me \nwhen I saw a girl sitting quietly reading in the corner of the Hilltop playground one \nlunch-time. Her playing was not energetic, irrational, or opposed to \u201ework\u201f [13], \nand the form of embodiment it took was closer to rest than motion. It is because \nof moments like this that I want to leave playing a conceptually open category. I \nurge modesty because I do not wish colonize the becoming of playing (again), \nand hence I refrain from saying anything more than \u201eaction\u201f. It does not follow \n 31 \nthough, that such modesty leaves us empirically high and dry. As I suggested at \nthe beginning of this paper, we all know what playing is, which is to say there will \nalways be a spatially, temporally and culturally situated being of playing\u201fs \nbecoming, and each becoming builds on or departs from sedimented notions of \nwhat playing is. Hence there can be no one theory of playing as such, just \ntheorizations that are themselves always differential relations of movement and \nrest, akin to an open-ended conversation.  \n \nSecondly, the Deleuzian notion of bodies that I have introduced, and the \nreworked notion of embodiment that it demands, recognizes that we humans are \nonly a small part of the world and the way it works. With regards to my discussion \nof playing, this is another way of saying that playing is not (just) kids stuff. This is \nnot to deny that children play a great deal, nor to suggest that studies of children \nplaying should be de-legitimized. I simply wish to make the point that in thinking \nand writing about playing, we must realize that even in child-centered studies, \nthere are a great many more bodies playing than just the young people involved. \n(I\u201fm thinking once again of Gidney\u201fs playing performance). In the course of this \npaper, my theorization of playing certainly applies to me as much as the children \ninvolved. Playing is something we all do, albeit to different extents and degrees, \nand this is something that needs a great deal more investigation [14]. Certainly \nthe next time I think of studying children and playing, maybe I\u201fll pause a little \nlonger to interrogate the effects that this \u201eand\u201f between playing and children has \non the directions I focus my critical attention.  \n 32 \n \nThirdly, there are significant methodological implications that derive from the \napproach to playing I have outlined in this paper. For my research I used \nperformance ethnography as a method for investigating playing. I choose this \nmethod because in thinking through playing, I would argue in order to understand \nit, you have to actually do it. However, in discussing such experiences it is \nnecessary to exercise caution. Firstly, in playing with children, my discussion \n(both empirical and theoretical), is based on relational knowledges. That is to say, \nin my discussion of the playing performances in this paper, I have not really been \ntalking about the playing of my research participants. On the other hand, I have \nnot been talking about my playing experiences either. The playing that \ncontextualizes this paper occurred between my participants and me. It is in this \nsense that I think we can talk with young people, where talking with them means \ntalking about the relation between us (during research) without reducing them to \nthis relation. In this sense, I would agree with Philo (2003) that there are (albeit \nprecarious) connections between the worlds of adults and children. I would \nsuggest that rather than knowing \u201etheir\u201f world, we can instead know something \nabout this betweenness that we both share. What occurs between adults and \nchildren is inevitably inflected by unequal relations of power, but it is, irreducibly, \na shared space. The ethical task then becomes, how do we create and live in \nsuch spaces, which Aitken (2001) has begun to explore. The second \nmethodological implication is that the re-presentation of those performances in \nthis paper (i.e. the research diary extracts) are themselves poor catalysts for \n 33 \nthought and feeling. That is to say, that although I have tried to evoke the \nperformances with words (in an attempt to engage affect), any effort to \u201ecapture\u201f \naffect is destined to fail. Therefore, I can only hope that the affects these words \ngenerate might be similar to those I experienced with the young people at Hilltop \nduring my research. Such a statement also functions as a challenge for future \nresearch, to explore different methods and what other things they can tell us \nabout playing and spacing. \n \nMy final conclusion is that playing isn\u201ft necessarily emancipatory. Recalling the \nyear 4 boys playing football every lunchtime, playing in this instance seemed to \nhave more to do with performing sedimented (and gender inflected) playing \npractices than challenging these norms. In using playing as an important \ncategory with which to understand children\u201fs lives, I am arguing that current \napproaches often only deal with half the story, largely ignoring the ways in which \nplaying is often about conformity and socializing to an imaginary norm. The \nliberating potential of playing performances is thus always determined in the \ncontingency of the encounter. Any politics based on playing therefore relies on a \nnarrow and precarious base. I would suggest that such a politics, therefore, can \ndo no more than modestly admit this, and look to disciplines and techniques \nwhich might aid in re-enacting this potential as extensively as possible (Connolly, \n2002). \n \nAcknowledgements \n 34 \n \nMy thanks to all the children and staff at Hilltop, who played such an important \npart in the research for this paper. Thanks also to J-D Dewsbury and John \nHorton for their playful engagement with that research and my efforts at making \nsense of it. Many thanks to those who listened to and commented upon a version \nof this paper, which I presented at the 99th Annual Meeting of the AAG, New \nOrleans. I\u201fm very grateful to Geraldine Pratt for her insights into playing, which \nhave substantially improved this body of work. Finally, thanks to Stuart Aitken \nand the two anonymous referees, whose excellent and generous commentaries \nhelped a great deal. \n \nNotes \n \n[1] This is a pseudonym, used as part of a confidentiality agreement signed with \nthe school. \n[2] I am thinking particularly of the work of Keith Ansell Pearson (1997, 1999, \n2002), and his explorations of this concept in relation to the philosophy of \nNietzsche, Deleuze and Bergson. \n[3] I am not sure I entirely agree with this assessment. As Thrift (2000a) among \nothers has shown, playing performances can be precisely the type of \nactivity which contemporary capitalism colonizes in its efforts to increase \nworkers productivity. \n 35 \n[4] Readers may also wish to consult recent work on non-representational \ngeographies (Thrift 1996, 2000b; Dewsbury et al. 2002), which drawing \nheavily on Performance Studies could provide similar resources. Indeed, \nThrift could very well have had playing in mind when he talks about \npractice as \u201eunwritable, unsayable, and unstable. And that is its fascination; \nit is a living demonstration of the skills we have but cannot ever articulate \nfully in the linguistic domain\u201f (2000b, p.235). \n[5] Mrs R. is a pseudonym for the reception teacher, used as part of the \nconfidentiality agreement I signed with the school. \n[6] An example of a playing performance which was not primarily based on what \nexceeds representation is the drawing one boy, aged 7, did of a board \ngame, itself a wonderful attempt to evoke the more affective elements of \nplaying. \n[7] I am reminded here once again of Schechner\u201fs injunction to work with the \u201ethe \npermeating, eruptive\/disruptive energy and mood below, behind and to the \nside of focused attention\u201f. \n[8] It should be noted that for Connolly, thinking is a product of the \nbrain\/body\/culture network, \u201ea complex, layered activity, with each layer \ncontributing something to the ensemble of dissonant relays and feedback \nloops between numerous centers. These loops include many different \nbodily sites sending signals about the state of the body to the brain\u201f (2002, \np.10). Hence thinking involves the interplay of cognitive, sensual and \naffective faculties while being irreducible to any of these distinctions. \n 36 \n[9] Note that Massumi (2002) suggests affect escapes \u201eactually existing, structure \nthings\u201f. This is to say, that it is not just the non-human, but even the non-\norganic that can affect and be affected in turn, a point I return to later in \nrelation to Deleuze\u201fs definition of a body. See also Marks (2002), esp. \nchapters 11 and 12. \n[10] Foucault\u201fs Discipline and Punish (1977) demonstrates, among other things, \nthe great lengths that are required to maintain (discipline) a body in a \nparticular state. \n[11] Dewsbury (2000) illustrates this point well: Think of a building. Although you \nmay think of it as a permanent structure, it is falling down, just very slowly \n(hopefully!)  \n[12] Bruno Latour (2002) provides a fantastic illustration of this idea in relation to \nthe sociology of Tarde. \n[13] Indeed, I would argue that the division between work and play is constantly \nsusceptible to metamorphosis. Sometimes playing is barely (if at all) \ndiscernable from work (such as this girl reading in the playground), while \nat other times a strict partition between the two will be enacted. Most of \nthe time the relationship between playing and working will be far more \ncomplex and difficult to disentangle - such is the nature of practice. \n[14] Common wisdom dictates that children play more than adults, and Jones \n(2003) argument, that children\u201fs lives are more immediately structured by \nemotion, would seem to add weight to this assertion. However, I am \n 37 \nunwilling to come to any conclusions on this matter, if only because of the \npaucity of studies of adults\u201f playing.  \n \nBibliography \n \nAitken, S. C.
