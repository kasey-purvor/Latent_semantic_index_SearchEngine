This is to take into account the \ncompositional and microstructural variation across the weld caused by the thermal \ncycle of welding, as local changes in solute content of the parent alloy cause changes \nin the stress-free lattice parameter. \nAlthough ideally such measurements should be obtained from small cubes machined \nfrom the weld, the use of a comb sample has previously been proposed as a macro-\nstress-free reference, with the assumption that each finger of the comb is of \ninsufficient dimension to hold a macro-stress field. This paper presents an approach \ntowards analysis of the stress-free reference values using a comb sample extracted \nfrom a Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) welded plate.  It is shown that there is \ninter-granular stress and retained macro-stress within the comb teeth, and an \nexperimental approach to deal with the problem is proposed.  \n1 Introduction \n \nNeutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction are now widely used as techniques to \ndetermine residual strains \u2013 and hence stresses \u2013 deep inside engineering structures \nand components [1]. The average inter-planar spacing of a large number of grains \n                                                 \n*\n Corresponding Author: m.e.fitzpatrick@open.ac.uk \n*Manuscript\nPage 3 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\ninside a polycrystalline component is measured either for a single lattice reflection (by \nmonochromatic radiation) or for multiple lattice reflections (by polychromatic \nradiation) and strain is determined by using the inter-planar spacing as an \u2018atomic \nstrain gauge\u2019. This is based on the principle of Bragg diffraction, with the lattice \nspacing calculated using: \n\uf06c = 2d sin\uf071\uf020 \uf028\uf031\uf029\uf020\uf020\nwhere \uf06c\uf020is the wavelength of the radiation used, \uf071 is half the diffraction angle 2\uf071, and \nd is the lattice spacing. \nThe strain is then calculated by: \n\uf0a0\uf020\n\uf065 \uf03d\nd \uf02d d0\nd0\n (2) \nwhere d0 is the lattice spacing for the unstressed condition. \nAccurate determination of strain, therefore, depends on measurement of the stress-free \nreference d0. It has been observed that an error of 0.1% in d0 may lead to significant \nerror (up to 1000 \u00b5\u03b5) in strain calculation [2]. \n \nFor an engineering component the stress-free reference can commonly be obtained in \na number of ways [2], such as by using a powder sample or measuring at an assumed \nstress-free position within the material.  However, the stress-free reference should \nreflect any change of lattice parameter owing to the mechanical and\/or thermal \nprocessing history of the component: so for example, a powder reference should be \nsubject to the same thermal history as the component being measured. More advanced \nmethods are possible such as the use of Bragg edges [3, 4], or applying stress to a \nmaterial to elucidate the stress-free parameter [5], but are rarely applied in practice. \n \nIn fusion welding, along the weld line the base metal melts and then re-solidifies. This \nis known as the fusion zone. The zone neighbouring the fusion zone experiences \ntransient heating during each welding pass and this is known as the heat-affected zone \n(HAZ). The base metal in the HAZ does not melt, but the heating is enough to change \nthe metallurgical condition of the base metal in the fusion and heat-affected zones. \nThe compositional variation that occurs during fusion welding due to the thermal \ncycle can change the stress-free reference lattice parameter. In most fusion welding \nprocesses a filler wire is introduced which also changes the composition in and \naround the fusion zone. The heat effect of welding also changes the state of \nPage 4 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nprecipitates and cold worked structure. All these factors influence the stress-free \nlattice parameter. Therefore, to measure weld residual stress it is necessary to devise \nan appropriate method to determine the stress-free reference in order to correct the \nmeasured strains in the welded plate.  \n \nA common practice to measure the stress-free reference in a weld is to machine out a \ncube from an equivalent spatial location of the measured component, of insufficient \ndimension to hold an internal residual stress field [6-8]. Such cubes, if sufficiently \nsmall, can be assumed to be free of elastic stress. Inter-granular (type II) micro-\nstresses can remain, but should be the same as in the main component.  \nMachining of a comb sample across the weld to use as a stress-free reference is \nfrequently used, with the assumption that each finger in a comb would be of \ninsufficient dimension to hold an internal residual stress field [9, 10]. This is useful \nbecause machining and handling small cubes are difficult apart from the fact that set \nup of individual cube specimens in a neutron or synchrotron X-ray source can be \nprohibitively time consuming. Also a comparative study between the comb and cube \nmethods revealed good agreement, although the comparative measurement was \nperformed near the parent metal only [11]. \n \nIn this paper, we report the evaluation of the stress-free reference lattice parameter \nobserved during evaluation of the stress variation in a coupon plate sample welded by \nthe Variable Polarity Plasma Arc (VPPA) process. A comb specimen was machined \nout by electro-discharge machining from the end of the plate, which allowed position-\nbased correction of the measured strain in the welded plate. The comb specimen \nshowed a distinct variation in the d0 values when measured by monochromatic \nneutron and synchrotron X-ray radiation for a single lattice reflection. A d vs. sin\n2\uf079 \nexperiment [12] was performed by synchrotron X-rays by measuring three additional \ntilts (\uf079 = 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0) apart from \uf079 =0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 which correspond to the \nlongitudinal and normal directions respectively. This experiment was carried out to \nfind the presence of any unrelieved elastic macro residual stress in the comb sample in \nthe direction of its maximum dimension. The data showed the presence of unrelieved \nmacro residual stress in the through thickness, normal, direction of the reference comb \nspecimen. The reference lattice spacing data measured was then corrected accordingly \nPage 5 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nin light of the stress observed by the sin\n2\uf079\uf020\uf020technique. The correction of the reference \ncell parameter based on the stress measured is based on the reasonable assumption \nthat the unrelieved stress exists uniaxially in the direction of maximum dimension. \nTherefore, it provides an approximate correction of the reference lattice spacing \nmeasured in a comb sample.  \nThe comb specimen was then measured by a white pulsed neutron beam at a \nspallation neutron source, where it is possible to determine the average cell parameter \nby refining all the peaks in the diffraction spectrum, which gives the average lattice \nparameter. \nThe study presented here is crucial in understanding that a comb sample may contain \nunrelieved residual stress field, and in order to have confidence in the measurements \nmade using a comb sample it is necessary to characterize the macro- tress state that \nremains in the comb teeth.   \n2 Material \n \nAA2024-T351 aluminium alloy, welded autogenously (i.e. without use of any filler \nmetal), was studied here. Two AA2024 plates of length 500 mm, width 140 mm and \nthickness 12 mm, rolled and heat treated to the T351 condition, were welded together \nby a single-pass variable polarity plasma arc (VPPA) process [13]. Two sets of \nwelded plates of 500 mm length were supplied. From each of the 500 mm long \nwelded plates two pieces of 240 mm and 120 mm length along the welding direction \nwere extracted, after sufficient discard from the ends to ensure that the samples were \ntaken from a region of steady state welding conditions. The welding direction is the \nsame as the rolling direction and considered as the longitudinal strain direction (LD), \nwhile the other two orthogonal directions along the width and the through thickness \ndirections were termed the transverse (TD) and the normal strain directions (ND) \nrespectively. A comb specimen with teeth dimensions of 2.7 mm \u00d7 2.7 mm \u00d7 12 mm \nwas machined out from between the 240 mm and 120 mm long plates by electro-\ndischarge machining using wire of 0.25 mm diameter. The reference comb sample \nwas machined out \u00b160 mm from the weld centre from a position in between the two \nplates of 240 mm and 120 mm length. A schematic diagram of the coupon welded \nplate and the stress-free reference comb sample is shown in figure 1, where an \nimaginary ABCD plane shows the measurement position in the coupon sample \nPage 6 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\ndescribed elsewhere [14]. The distance between the centres of two neighbouring \nfingers of the comb is approximately 3 mm. The objective of machining the comb \nsample is that the small dimension of each finger would be unable to hold any macro \nresidual stress inside it. It can be seen from the figure that the dimension of each \ncomb \u2018finger\u2019 in the normal direction is 12 mm, and 2.7 mm in the other two principal \ndirections.  \nA hardness profile across the weld revealed a near-heat-affected zone (HAZ) up to \n\u00b112 mm from the weld centre while the far HAZ is \u00b125 mm from the weld centre [14].  \n3 Experimental Techniques \nThe residual stress in the coupon plate was determined by a combination of neutron \nand synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The plate was also studied after a skimming \ntreatment to reduce the plate thickness, which will alter the stress field but does not \nrequire a different reference sample.  The reference comb sample was measured under \nidentical conditions as the welded plates, and the experime tal details at the neutron \nand synchrotron X-ray sources used are given below. The comb sample was measured \nat all the sources detailed. When measurements were made in the comb teeth, a \nposition towards the end of each tooth (typically ~4 mm from the tooth end) was used. \n3.1 Measurement by neutron diffraction: single wavelength \nsource \n \nThe as-welded coupon plate was measured on the D1A diffractometer at the reactor \nneutron source at the ILL, Grenoble, France. In this experiment strain measurements \nwere made in the three principal directions, with corresponding measurements in the \nstress-free reference comb. An incoming beam size of 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm was used during \nthe measurements, and a 1 mm collimator was used for the diffracted beam. The \nwavelength of the incident monochromatic beam was 1.911 \u00c5. The (311) lattice \nreflection was used, as this reflection is well-known to give good representation of the \naverage lattice strain in the measured gauge volume [15]. The diffraction angle for \nthis reflection at the stated wavelength was 103\u00b0. A schematic view of the comb set \nup is shown in figure 2a. Figure 2b shows the geometric gauge volume dimension \nalong the different directions during measurement of the transverse strain direction. \nThe gauge volume was carefully positioned inside each tooth of the comb by wall \nPage 7 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nscanning, as a partially-filled gauge would lead to the generation of pseudostrain \nbecause of spurious shifting of the diffraction peak position [16]. \n3.2 Measurement with synchrotron X-rays \n \nThe longitudinal and transverse strain directions of the as-welded and skimmed plate \nwere measured at the ID31 beam line at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility \n(ESRF), Grenoble, France. The smaller stress-free reference comb could be measured \nin all the principal directions, however measurement of the out-of-plane normal \ndirection in reflection is not feasible in the plate sample as it would lead to a high path \nlength for the beam, owing to the low scattering angle.  \nSynchrotron X-rays of 45 keV were used in the experiment, which corresponds to a \nwavelength of 0.2745\u00c5. The (311) plane of reflection was used for measurement \nwhich resulted in a diffraction angle 2\uf071 of 12.5\u00b0. Measurement of the (311) plane \nallowed for comparison with the results obtained from the monochromatic neutron \nsource. \nA schematic set up of the side view during measurement of the normal direction is \nshown in figure 3. An incident beam of 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm was used. The vertical opening \nof the detector was kept at 0.5 mm. The resulting gauge volume shape and dimensions \nare also shown in figure 3.  It can be seen that the instrumental gauge volume, which \nis defined by the intersection of the incident and diffracted beam, is elongated more \nthan the dimension of the comb sample in the direction of the incident beam; therefore, \nthe instrumental gauge volume extends beyond the irradiated volume of material. \nHowever, at beam line ID31 the detectors are preceded by Si (111) analyser crystals, \nand therefore the angle of diffraction is strictly defined by the diffracted beam from \nthe sample, rather than the spatial position viewed by slits in front of the detectors. \nHence partial immersion does not constitute a problem in the same way as it would \nhave done when measuring at an instrument with no analyser crystal. \nA d vs. sin\n2\uf079 experiment was performed to determine the presence of any stress \ncomponent in the form of macro-stress in the normal direction, by measuring the \ncomb sample in different \uf079 tilts. A schematic view of the sin2\uf079 experiment is shown \nin figure 4. The comb sample was measured in 5 different \uf079 tilts (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, \n90\u00b0) where 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 are measurements along the longitudinal and normal directions \nrespectively. The stress was then evaluated using equation 3 by using the plane-\nPage 8 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nspecific elastic constants, an approximate value of d0 and by determination of m from \nthe linear regression of the d vs. sin\n2\uf079\uf020\uf020data as shown in figure 5 [17]. \n \nm\nd\nE\nLN \uf0b4\n\uf0b4\uf02b\n\uf03d\uf02d\n0)1( \uf06e\n\uf073\uf073  (3) \n \nIn this method of stress determination measurement of actual d0 is not necessary and \nan average d-spacing can be taken for d0 without introducing any significant error in \nthe calculation [18]. A typical d vs. sin\n2\uf079 plot is shown in figure 5. The positive slope \nis indicative of a residual tensile stress. The stress measured in this method was then \nreasonably assumed to be the unrelieved stress in the normal direction as the \nlongitudinal direction dimension (< 3 mm) is insufficient to hold any elastic macro- \nstress field. \n \n3.3 Measurement by pulsed neutrons \n \nThe stress-free reference comb was then measured by pulsed neutrons on the ENGIN \ndiffractometer at the UK\u2019s ISIS spallation neutron source. At a spallation source, \nneutrons are produced in pulses and each pulse of neutrons has a range of \nwavelengths. Therefore, the diffraction spectrum comprises multiple peaks. For the \nENGIN diffractometer at ISIS (now superseded by ENGIN-X), the detectors were \npositioned at a fixed angle and, depending upon the wavelength in a pulse satisfying \nBragg\u2019s condition (equation 1), peaks for different lattice reflections are observed. \nThe experiment by spallation neutrons was designed not only to see the d0 variation \nwhen multiple reflections are used, but also to observe the pattern for the other \nreflecting planes along the two principal directions. \nA schematic top view for the comb measurement set up on ENGIN is shown in figure \n6. The two detectors are separated mutually by 180\u00b0, at a fixed angle of \u00b190\u00b0 with \nrespect to the incoming beam. The specimen is positioned so that two orthogonal \nstrain directions are measured simultaneously by the two detectors. The longitudinal \nand transverse directions of the stress-free comb were measured simultaneously as \nshown in figure 6. \nThe average stress-free parameter was obtained by Pawley refinement [19] of the \nentire diffraction spectra using GSAS software [20]. Individual peaks are also refined \nusing GSAS software. The comparison between the average stress free lattice \nPage 9 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nparameter and lattice spacing from individual peaks reveals the anisotropy between \ndifferent crystallographic directions.   \n4 Results  \n \nThe reference parameter variation, as measured in the comb specimen, for the three \nprincipal directions as observed by monochromatic neutrons at the ILL is shown in \nfigure 7. Although near the weld the stress free lattice parameters show similar \nvariations in the different directions, in the parent metal a distinct difference is \nobserved between the different directions.  \nA similar d0 variation was observed when measured by monochromatic synchrotron \nX-rays at ESRF (figure 8): this would be expected as at both sources the (311) lattice \nreflection was measured. The measurements at the monochromatic sources clearly \nindicate a difference in variation between the longitudinal direction and the other two \nprincipal directions. \nAs explained before the stress variation measured using the d vs sin\n2\uf079 technique was \nuniaxially present in the normal direction and is shown in figure 9. A macro residual \nstress of about 45 MPa is observed near the parent metal while near the centre of the \nweld within a region of \u00b120mm the stress magnitude is less than 10 MPa. These stress \nvalues are sufficiently high to cause error in the final weld stress calculations, and it \nwas therefore necessary to account for their presence in the evaluation of the d0 values \nfor the weld. The results also highlight a potential problem in the use of comb samples \nfor d0 calculation, as the comb dimensions can allow for significant residual stress to \nbe retained. The method of measuring in the comb tooth close to the free end [10], \nwhere the stress will be relaxed approaching the free surface, would be likely to \nprovide more accurate results, but removes the advantage of the comb sample of rapid \ncounting by opening up the gauge volume along the length of the comb teeth. \nAdditionally, this can lead to measurements being made away from the weld bead in \ncertain geometries, so giving increased error in the d0 determination as the \ncompositional variation of reference cell parameter would not be accounted for \nprecisely because the strain measurement was performed at the central through-\nthickness line. \nWith this stress data the lattice parameter measured in the normal direction can be \ncorrected [21] for the unrelieved stress as shown in equation 5.  \nPage 10 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n\uf0a0\uf020\na0,ND \uf03d\naND\n1\uf02b\n\uf073N\nE\n \n(5) \nwhere a0,ND is the lattice parameter after correction and aND is the measured lattice \nparameter. \uf073\uf04e\uf020is the stress measured in the normal direction by the sin\n2\uf079 technique \nand E is the Young\u2019s modulus. \nThe longitudinal and transverse lattice parameters are also corrected for Poisson strain \nas shown in equation 6. \n\uf0a0\uf020\na0,LD \uf03d aLD (1\uf02b\n\uf06e\nE\n\uf073N )  \n\uf0a0\uf020\na0,TD \uf03d aTD (1\uf02b\n\uf06e\nE\n\uf073N )  \n(6) \nwhere a0,LD and a0,TD are the lattice parameters after correction in the transverse and \nlongitudinal directions respectively, aLD and aTD are the measured lattice parameters \nin the longitudinal and transverse directions, and E and \uf06e\uf020are the elastic constants, the \nYoung\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio respectively.  \nThe correction of the measured reference lattice parameter of each position was done \nbased on the stress measured in the corresponding finger of the comb sample. The \ncorrection leads to a change in strain magnitude of about 600 \uf06dstrain in the normal \ndirection and 215 \uf06dstrain in the longitudinal and transverse directions near the parent \nmetal. Fig. 10 shows the reference lattice parameter variation after correction. Note \nthat the longitudinal and normal direction lattice parameters show good agreement \nafter the correction, although there is still a difference for the transverse direction. \nThe reference cell parameter variation for the multiple diffraction spectra observed at \nISIS is shown in figure 11. The reference cell parameter variation in the longitudinal \nand transverse directions show similar trends in this case. This strongly suggests that \nthe difference in variation observed when measured by monochromatic radiation is \ndue to inter-granular strains between the longitudinal and transverse strain directions.  \nThis can be investigated further by examination of the behaviour of the individual \ndiffraction peaks in the spectra. The reference lattice parameter variation obtained \nfrom refinement of individual peaks of the diffraction spectra at ISIS is shown in \nfigure 12. It can be seen that the individual lattice reflections show different trends in \nthe two principal directions; even though the average parameters obtained by \nrefinement of the entire diffraction spectra are similar. Therefore, it can be inferred \nPage 11 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nthat the differences in trend between the longitudinal and transverse strain direction is \ndue to inter-granular strains between the different directions. This is entirely plausible, \nas the plates are produced by a rolling route involving extensive plastic deformation, \nand aluminium is plastically anisotropic [22].  \nThe anisotropy strain from previous plastic deformation present in a crystal lattice \nwould lead to line broadening [23]. Due to its very high peak-width resolution \n(~0.003\u00b0) synchrotron diffraction peaks are ideal for analysis of peak broadening. \nFigure 13 shows the centreline peak-width analysis of the reference comb. The higher \npeak-width near the parent plate in the transverse direction suggests the presence of \nplastic anisotropy strain.  \nConclusions \n \n1 The variation in stress-free lattice parameter around a VPPA weld in 2024 \naluminium has been determined using neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. A \ncomb sample was machined from a welded sample to provide the reference values, \nwith the assumption that the small dimensions of the comb teeth would relax any \nresidual stress present. However, retained macro residual stress was observed in the \nnormal direction of the reference comb sample, which is the direction of its maximum \ndimension (12 mm). \n2. The stress magnitude along the direction of maximum dimension in the comb \nteeth was determined by the sin\n2\uf079 technique, and the measured reference comb cell \nparameters were approximately corrected for the unrelieved macro-stress. \n3. The presence of plastic inter-granular strain was observed in the transverse \ndirection. Analysis of single peaks from multi-peak spallation source diffraction \nspectra showed the effects of anisotropy between the different principal directions. \nPeak-width analysis of synchrotron X-ray peaks also showed line broadening in the \ntransverse direction near the parent plate. \n4. The results show that comb samples should not be used to provide a stress-free \nreference without corresponding measurement of retained macro-stress. The proposed \nmethod of measuring only near the end of a tooth reduces the advantage of using the \nfull tooth length to minimize count times, and may lead to errors in the position of the \nmeasured reference relative to the weld bead. \n \nPage 12 of 28\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nAcknowledgements \nSG was supported by the Towards a Sustainable Energy Economy (TSEC) \nprogramme KNOO, and the EPSRC is thanked for funding under grant EP\/C549465\/1. \nWe are grateful to the ILL for the provision of beam time at the D1A beamline; to the \nESRF for beam time at ID31; and to the ISIS facility for beam time at ENGIN.
