Current approaches\nfor the thin film growth of superconducting involve\ndepositions of or Mg\/B mixtures with extra Mg onto\na substrate at a high temperature, followed by an anneal at a\ntemperature above 600 after deposition [4], [5]. The high\ntemperature deposition and anneal brings in a potential problem\nfor the fabrication of multiple layered structures, which is the\nmost convenient form for superconducting electronics device\nfabrication.

Considering the fact that both Mg and\nhave low melting temperature at about 650 , obviously\nany process at temperatures above 600 should be avoided for\nthe electronics device fabrication, as such a high temperature\nwould lead to serious Mg vapor diffusion and decompo-\nsition which are detrimental to the formation and maintenance\nof sharp interface structures. For many challenging applications\nin high speed devices, a large number of uniform Josephson\njunctions have to be built with high integration density [6].\nFor future applications of superconducting electronics, the\nideal thin film deposition technique for should be a low\ntemperature process with capability for multiple layer structure\nfabrication and compatibility with current microelectronics\ntechnology.\nThough deposition of superconducting thin films has\nbeen reported recently at relatively low temperatures with new\ntechniques [7], [8], there are still technical problems to meet\nthe criteria set above. Furthermore, the quality of single layer\nthin film still needs improvement. Moreover an integrated low\ntemperature process for both thin film growth and electronics\ndevice fabrication is still not available.\nThe common feature of all those reported low temperature\ndeposition approaches is the direct deposition of both Mg\nand B simultaneously, so the phase is formed at low\ntemperature during the deposition process by controlling the\ndeposition conditions. We note the similarity of crystal structures\nbetween Mg and [9]: the crystal structure of\nlooks like an intercalation of two-dimensional hexagonal B\nsheet in between the host Mg hexagonal structure, with an\nexpansion and displacement of the neighboring Mg sheets in\nthe Mg structure to accommodate the B sheet, which also leads\nto an increase in mass density in compared to that of\npure Mg. In other words, the framework of Mg could provide\na structural constraint for the formation of the flat B sheets\nthat are believed to be critical for the high . Therefore we\nanticipate that a low temperature process will be possible if\nsufficient B can be mixed with a solid Mg at atomic scale\nto form .\nEffective thermal diffusion of B into a Mg solid target may be\none approach to achieve atomic scale mixing of B with solid Mg,\nbut it needs a high diffusion temperature. At temperatures below\nthe melting point of Mg, equilibrium thermodynamics for the bi-\nnary Mg-B system suggests that the process will be very slow, if\nit is indeed possible [1], [2]. Furthermore, the thermal diffusion\nprocess is not a good approach for sharp profile control.\n1051-8223\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In contrast to the thermal diffusion process, ion\nimplantation is not a thermodynamically equilibrium process,\nand high concentrations of B can be achieved in a Mg host\nby high fluence ion implantation. In fact, ion implantation is\na well-established technology in today\u2019s microelectronics in-\ndustry. A low annealing temperature should be sufficient for the\nphase growth as both Mg and B ions have been mixed\nthoroughly at atomic scale by the ion implantation process.\nBy implanting B into a Mg target, we have explored the\nfabrication of superconducting thin films at temper-\natures below 500 . The formation of the superconducting\nphase has been confirmed by Rutherford backscattering\nspectroscopy (RBS), cross sectional transmission electron\nmicroscopy and DC magnetization observations. We reported\na low of 15 K previously [10]. Here we demonstrate an\nimprovement in to 21 K by increasing ion implantation\nfluences, and compare the implantation results with numerical\nsimulations.\nII. SIMULATION OF ION BEAM SYNTHESIS PROCESS\nWhen energetic B ions are implanted into a solid Mg target,\nan embedded B rich thin layer will be formed inside the Mg\ntarget. The B distribution inside Mg can be described very\nwell by using the classical binary collision approximation\n[11]. Our simulation code SUSPRE [12] has been developed\nfor the numerical simulation of any ion implantation process.\nFortunately, is the binary Mg boride with the lowest\nB concentration among all Mg borides and a very stable stoi-\nchiometry. Assuming that we can keep adding B into the target\nMg host until that the critical ratio of B to Mg is 2:1 at which\npoint it overflows into the neighboring target element, the\nsimulated results using SUSPRE code reveal that the minimum\nimplantation dose for a 80 keV B beam is\nto achieve a peak 2:1 ratio of B to Mg, as illustrated by curve\na in Fig. 1. Further increase of implantation dose will lead to\nthe overflow of extra B into surrounding area, so the\nthickness grows, as shown by curve b in Fig. 1. It is obvious that\nthe minimum dose required for a stoichiometry depends\ndirectly on the beam energy. For example, the minimum fluence\nrequired to achieve a 2:1 B to Mg ratio for a 120 keV B beam\nis . However, significant B overflow\nis expected for a B implantation at\n30 keV, as shown by curve c in Fig. 1. The superposition of\nboth B implantation at 30 keV and\nB implantation at 80 keV leads to the\nformation of a double layer structure as represented by curve d\nin Fig. 1. The B poor ditch in between the two B rich plateaus is\nof interest for planar SNS type sandwich structure fabrication\nif the B poor layer has a low .\nApparently our simulation model is a very simple description\nfor the real physical process of B implantation in Mg. For accu-\nrate profile and composition control, sputtering effect must be\ntaken into account. The sputtering process is dependent on the\nFig. 1. The simulated B depth profiles in Mg target with different implantation\nfluences and energies: a, 1:9\u000210 B=cm at 80 keV; b, 2:15\u000210 B=cm\nat 80 keV; c, 1:25\u000210 B=cm at 30 keV; and d, the superposition of b and c.\nbeam implantation conditions such as relative ion mass, dose\nand beam energy etc. The sputtering effect is minimized by\nusing B implantation into Mg target, as B is much lighter than\nMg in mass.\nThe continuous growth of is possible only if extra B\noverflows into the neighboring \u201cB poor\u201d area. In theory, there\nis possibility that as more B introduced into the Mg target it be-\ncomes increasingly difficult to find a new place to incorporate\nthe implant and the material \u201cwanders off\u201d to a neighboring ele-\nment more frequently as the concentration approaches the satu-\nration level. In this case it is possible for sputtering to affect the\nsaturation limit, and consequently the composition profile never\nreaches a flat top with designed stoichiometry.\nObviously there are many factors that are believed to be im-\nportant for the control of ion implantation process. As a pilot\nstudy on ion beam synthesis of , we will focus our cur-\nrent implantation experiments on the under-dose and close to\nstoichiometry implantations first.\nIII. THIN FILM GROWTH BY ION IMPLANTATION\nBased on the numerical simulation results described above,\nwe have carried out two sets of B implantation experiments\ninto common commercial Mg ribbons, one is at\n80 keV and another is at 120 keV using the\n200 KV Danfsik implanter. As revealed from the RBS analysis,\nthe surface of the Mg ribbon is more or less oxidized already. By\nchanging the B ion energy, we may include a small amount of\nMgO in the implantation area with 80 keV B beam or exclude\nnearly all MgO at all with 120 keV B beam. All Mg ribbons\nwere mounted on double sided conducting tapes with an em-\nbedded thermocouple to monitor the implantation temperature\nin-situ. The Mg targets were kept at a warm 230 during im-\nplantations by using the beam heating effect in order to avoid\nthe unwanted amourphization of Mg by the B irradiation. The\nexact target temperature is controlled by the beam current, and\nbeam scanning frequency\/area. X-ray diffraction on both virgin\nand as implanted Mg ribbons reveals that all Mg ribbons are in\ngood crystallite status.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Temperature dependent superconducting transitions from DC\nmagnetization measurement for a sample implanted with 10 B=cm at\n80 keV (curve a) and with 2\u000210 B=cm at 120 keV (curve b), both samples\nhave been annealed at 500 C for 1 hour.\nAll as implanted samples do not show strong evidence of su-\nperconducting phase transition, but we do observe some weak\nantiferromagnetic signals at low temperatures (less than 10 K),\nimplying the B in Mg host is not ordered. Post implant annealing\nis necessary for these implanted samples in order to enhance the\ngrowth of ordered grains. Annealing at 500 for 1 hour\nleads to a clear evidence for the superconducting phase tran-\nsition from DC magnetization measurements using a Quantum\nDesign SQUID magnetometer, now matter whether it is in either\nflowing Ar, or , or in a sealed quartz tube under vacuum. RBS\nanalysis of some of the annealed samples shows that the implant\ninhibits the growth of the surface oxides upon annealing.\nIt is interesting to note here that a higher of 21 K is ob-\nserved in samples implanted at 120 keV with , as\nshown in Fig. 2, while the values for those samples subjected\nto implantation of 80 keV B with a fluence of are\nonly about 15 K, indicating high dose might help for the for-\nmation of grains. The peak B concentration in 80 keV\nimplanted samples is just over 50% of the theoretical minimum\nvalue, but the average B concentration should be lower after\nthermal annealing as B may spread out to the neighboring area,\nthis helps to understand the experimental fact that an extended\nanneal at 500 cannot improve the value. In contrast to this,\nthe B concentration in 120 keV implanted samples is very close\nto the theoretical minimum value, it is very interesting to inves-\ntigate further whether a longer anneal will improve the or\nnot. More information will be available soon by implanting Mg\nwith B to an even higher concentration.\nIV. PROSPECT FOR AN INTEGRATED LOW TEMPERATURE\nDEVICE FABRICATION ROUTE\nWe have demonstrated low temperature ion beam synthesis\nof . Low values have been observed in samples with\nimplantation fluences below the saturation level. With further\noptimization on the growth conditions, we expect to fabricate\nsuperconducting thin films with various using the B\nion implantation approach at high implantation fluences. We\nhave demonstrated before that high quality Josephson junctions\ncan be fabricated with polycrystalline thin films using the\nmasked proton beam damage method [13]. The thin film syn-\nthesis process described above can be easily extended to make\nmore complex structures for the superconductor electronics\ndevice manufacture. This is an important advantage of ion\nbeam synthesis process.\nThe low observed in under-dose implanted samples\nsuggests that a SNS or SIS type sandwich structure (possible\nJosephson junctions) can be fabricated by a sequential boron ion\nimplantation process with two different ion energies, as shown\nin Fig. 1. Sequential implants can also produce thick films.\nAn O implant could also be employed to turn the un-reacted\nMg in B poor interface area into MgO, which is an insulator.\nUsing a planar mask technology, other interesting interface\nstructures can also be fabricated. Maskless device fabrication\ncan be achieved as well if we use a pre-patterned Mg host for\nthe B implantation.\nIt is very clear that any new fabrication process of supercon-\nducting device should be cost effective in order to make\nit economically viable, at least compared to other technologies\neither with or other high superconductors. Compared\nto other thin film deposition methods, the primary extra cost\nfor the ion beam synthesis process described above is because\nhigh fluences take a relatively long implantation time. Even in\nour research implanter with a B beam current of 0.5 mA, an\nimplantation of for a cross section of 25\ncan be achieved in less than 5 hours. It should be emphasized\nhere that industrial facilities for high fluence B implantation,\nabout 10 mA in beam current, are readily available. This will\ncut the implantation time significantly. As the process is com-\npletely compatible with the microelectronics technology, the\nintegration of many superconducting and nonsuperconducting\ninterface structures will be straightforward. We believe this will\nenable affordable practical applications of superconducting\nelectronics.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors thank M. Browton, A. Cansell, A. Royle,\nD. Mansfield, V. Power, and B.
