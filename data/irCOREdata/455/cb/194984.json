This rich diversity may become a challenge for educational leaders, teachers, \nand policy makers in the absence of an understanding of diverse sources of knowledge people \ndraw on for directing their beliefs and daily practices. This paper explores the multi-ethnic \ncontext in Britain with a focus on Muslim students in English secondary schools, and argues \nfor drawing on diverse ethnic knowledge sources to inform and enrich approaches towards \nmanaging diversity. It discusses the concept of Adab derived from Muslim ethics and \nphilosophy, and debates possible contributions of such conceptual adaptations towards \nimproving educational engagement and performance. \nPopulation diversity is a sociological phenomenon managed by states and societies in \ndifferent ways at different levels (Bauman, 1997). The radical changes taking place in \nthe world around us are being reflected in the changing demographics in the British \nschools and elsewhere, posing management challenges to educational leaders, and \ndemanding revisits to concepts and practices. The current emphasis in Britain on \n\u2018celebrating\/valuing diversity\u2019, \u2018respect for all\u2019 and \u2018widening participation\u2019 (HEFCE \n2001) are moves forward from policies of assimilation, integration and \nmulticulturalism. However, these notions and approaches are ethnocentric in \norientation, and embedded in Western philosophy and values (Dimmock, 2000). These \ndo not acknowledge or incorporate relevant conceptualisations from other cultures \nand knowledge sources (Shah, 2006b). This imposes limitations on their \nappropriateness and applicability to multiethnic contexts with implications for both \ntheory and practice, and hinders enrichment of conceptualisations. \nThis paper explores multi-ethnic context at the secondary school level in England \n(UK) with a focus on Muslim students, and argues for availing ethnic knowledge \nsources and conceptualisations to inform the ethnocentric notions and definitions \ncurrently appropriated for managing diversity. The specific concept that this paper \ndiscusses is Adab which has a unique place within Islamic ethics and philosophy. \nHistorically, it has been adapted from pre-Islamic cultures (Azim, 1991), and \ndeveloped over the times within different traditions of Muslim communities. It \nbroadly embraces the meanings of the term \u2018respect\u2019, but is a more extended and \nmulti-layered concept. As a conceptual tool, Adab has proven significance for \nmanaging internal diversity of Muslim community on multiple sites including social \nand educational (Azim, 1991; Rooke, 1998; Shah, 2006a). Its appropriateness for \ncontexts of diversity indicates potential to inform policy and practice in multi-ethnic \nz 2 \nschools. In the backdrop of increasing emphasis placed by the British government on \nvaluing and respecting diversity, Adab as a conceptual frame could be availed to \nenrich and develop existing concepts. Second, educating in Adab can develop positive \nattitudes towards diversity. Third, Adab as a practice has the potential to contribute to \nsocial cohesion in general, and to the learners\u2019 self-esteem and affirmative self-\nconstructions in particular, underpinning their educational and social enhancement, as \ndiscussed later in this paper.  \nThe paper focuses on one group, loosely defined as \u2018Muslim students\u2019, in English \nsecondary schools. This focus has theoretical and practical relevance. Research \nindicates that the issues of identity and educational achievement become more \ncomplex at secondary school level (Abbas, 2004; Nieto, 2004). According to Piaget \n(1969), this age phase concurs with the ability to reason, and this reasoning becomes \nactive in shaping and challenging identity constructions, which in the case of young \nMuslim students, has implications for their achievement (Shah, 2006a). There are 1.6 \nMillion Muslims in Britain, and 33.8% are aged 0-15 years (National Statistics, 2001). \nThus, more than five hundred thousand Muslims in Britain fall within the compulsory \neducation age, which is a large student population for investigating and theorising. \nSecond, Muslim students are an interesting \u2018group\u2019 of diverse ethnicities, cultures, \nand nationalities, offering scope for theoretical complexity, which can be a useful \nanalytical tool for exploring other contexts of diversity. Third, the history and politics \nof inter-national relations in the post-imperial world (Said, 1978) and the subsequent \nimplications for citizenship have had particular impact on Muslims in the British \nsociety, where multiple historical, social, economic, strategic and political factors \nhave added to the complexities of interface on educational sites. Moreover, in the \nwake of 9\/11 and 7\/7, emerging competing political discourses have further added to \nthe complicatedness of inter-relations on educational sites with serious implications \nfor Muslim students and their experiences of schooling. Fourth, the level of \neducational achievement of certain sub-groups of Muslim students - such as \nBangladeshi, Pakistani, Somali, Turkish - has been a cause of concern to the \nrespective schools (Abbas, 2004; Archer, 2003; DFES, 2004), drawing attention to \nissues of performance.  \nz 3 \nIt will be simplistic to assume that the learners\u2019 performance\/achievement is linked \nonly to teaching\/learning activities, abilities, or learning styles. These are highly \nsignificant factors but within an environment which encourages and facilitates \nparticipation for diverse groups of learners. Creating and maintaining such \nenvironment are leadership challenge, requiring deeper sociological understanding \nand sensitivity (Mills, 1992). This paper is an effort to respond to that challenge. It \nsets out to explain diversity by looking briefly at how \u2018difference\u2019 is constructed, and \nhow the learners\u2019 ethnic identities are formulated, debating the impact of these \nconstructions on the learners\u2019 self-esteem, and exploring the interplay with \neducational achievement. The second part discusses the notion of Adab, and argues \nhow it can be availed to inform existing concepts and relevant practices, and what \ncontributions it can make to the learners\u2019 self-esteem with implications for their \nperformance. The paper is largely conceptual one: it draws on experience of \nresearching in English schools, and engages with wider literature to develop the \nargument. The intention is to present a concept for debate, suggesting adjustments in \nconcepts and practices for engaging with diversity. However, discussing processes \nand practices for implementation is beyond the scope of the current paper.  \nDiversity, Difference and Education \nDiversity is associated with \u2018difference\u2019, generally sending signals of un-equality - \nbetter or worse than the norm. This not only poses challenge to social justice and \nfairness in educational institutions, but also impacts on diverse learners\u2019 engagement \nwith education. Being marginalised and \u2018othered\u2019 through a discourse of difference \ngenerally has negative impact on the performance of ethnic minority students, adding \nalso to the difficulties of educational leaders in managing teaching\/learning. An issue \nwith the notion of diversity is how to accommodate difference with equality to \nliberate the students from experiencing marginalisation. Derrida\u2019s work (1988) on \n\u2018difference\/differance\u2019 problematised the concept, and pointed to possibilities of de-\nconstructing difference, highlighting conceptual complexity where difference and \nequality may not be in oppositional stances. This has similarities to Islamic thought \nwhere difference poses a sociological challenge to know, understand and connect: \nz 4 \nO mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and female and \nmade you into nations and tribes that ye may know each other \u2026 (The Quranii, \n49:13). \nSuch philosophical shared-ness hints at possibilities of adjustment in theory and \npractice by addressing broader conceptualisations of diversity. In Islam, \nacknowledgement of difference\/diversity is celebrated (the Quran 5:48; 49:11-13), \nencouraging \u2018a wider respect for difference\u2019 (Azim, 1991, p. 110). The argument is \n\u2018different but equal\u2019, which positions equality within diversity to counter any \nchallenges coming from \u2018difference\u2019, though without closing the debate around it \n(Shah, 1999).  \nManaging ethnic diversity has been an ever-increasing challenge for theory and \npractice in the post-Second-World-War Britain, raising issues of inclusion and \nachievement on educational sites. Modood (2005) asserts that non-whites are \n\u2018perceived and treated as racially defined groups of inferiors, outsiders and \ncompetitors whose right to be in Britain and to be treated as equal citizens was not \nfully accepted\u2019 (p.??). Diversity (difference!) is not only seen to be problematic on a \ntheoretical level, it is challenging and complex on practice level as well, where \nregimes of power (Foucault, 1980) may use \u2018difference\u2019 for discrimination and \nfragmentation. In multiethnic schools, diversity emerges as a problem rather than a \ncomplement. The educational processes often put in place for ethnic minority students \ninclude emphasis on, for example, inclusion, recognition of diversity of learning \nstyles, language provisions, ethnic minority teachers, community links and others, in \nthe efforts to cater for deficiencies and barriers to achievement. What seems to be \nlacking here is a framework to engage diversity through positive self-constructions, \nnot just in relation to the white ethnicity but on a wider interethnic level involving \ndiverse groups, to facilitate enhanced engagement of different ethnicities on \neducational sites and in the wider society. \nIdentity Constructions in Educational Institutions  \nThe sociological processes related to diversity (Bauman, 1997; Giddens, 1991), from \ninitial exclusionary practices through assimilation, integration and more recent \n\u2018celebration\u2019, appear to be moving full circle towards minorities\u2019 self-exclusion and \nz 5 \n\u2018in-group cohesion\u2019 (Jost and Major, 2004; Stangor, 2004), especially in the case of \nMuslim students. The global political developments in recent history, from Palestinian \nIntafada to post 9\/11 and 7\/7, have further driven Muslims towards a trans-national, \nsuper-ordinate Muslim identity (Ahmed, 2003; Hopkins and Hopkins, 2004), under \nthe increased threats of their becoming obvious targets of racism and terrorism. \nIdentity construction is a complex and dynamic process (Giddens, 1991), influenced \nby multiple in-group and out-group factors (Shah, 2006a). \u2018Identities are the names \nwe give to different ways we are positioned by, and position ourselves\u2019 (Hall, 1993, \np.394). How ethnic identities are constructed, projected or imposed reflects interplay \nof myriad factors, highlighting the need to develop an understanding of the issues and \nsociological processes involved in identity constructions, and their impact on \nstudents\u2019 achievement, as well as the inevitability to negotiate ways of addressing \nthese issues. For example, in the case of Muslim students, the drive towards a super-\nordinate Muslim identity has strengthened under the pressure of in-group and out-\ngroup forces, and is international in dimensions (Alles, 2003; Djao, 2004; Afridi, \n2001; Jacobson, 1998; Hopkins and Hopkins, 2004; Limage, 2000; Tlem\u00e7ani, 1997; \nHaddad, 2002; Kepe,l 1997). The impact of these pressures in identity negotiations is \nreflected to some extent in Kabbani\u2019s comments in post-Satanic-Verses scenario: \n\u2018We were caught between two tyrannies: ... even those who had hardly \nperceived of themselves as \"Muslim\" before, except in family ritual or \npersonal reference, were suddenly forced to stand up and be counted as \n\"warriors\" for subtlety in either side\u2019s position\u2019 (2002, p.1). \nSelf-constructions are influenced by self-perceptions and by how one is perceived by \nothers. Diverse communities are imagined and created by the state and administration \nfor the convenience of policy formation and resource allocation, but as a political \nperformance it can be misplaced essentialism. Diversity is positioned in opposition to \ndominant national identity, and diverse ethnic identities are constructed as a threat to \nsocietal cohesion. Association of ethnicity with negative markers like \nunderachievement, terrorism, and others is another political manipulation of \ndiscourses, and in the case of Muslim pupils these can be technologies to locate the \nblame for under-achievement in ethnicity\/race, which may hinder engagement with \nthe real issues affecting students\u2019 achievement. Second, it may affect interpersonal \nz 6 \nrelations in schools among teachers, students and others involved in teaching\/learning. \nThird, it may affect self-perceptions and self-esteem of the learners with implications \nfor their performance.  \nThe perception among the Muslims, particularly among the youth, of being \u2018targeted\u2019 \n(Ahmed, 2003; Esposito, 2002; Hagopian, 2004) and the processes such as special \nlegislations, police raids, profiling and \u2018stop and search\u2019 practices targeting Muslims \nhave left them feeling insecure and even paranoid, which may discourage educational \nengagement and social cohesion. The media has added to the complexity of the \nsituation (Ahmed, 1992) through media portrayals of Islam as barbaric, irrational, \nprimitive and sexist; and more recently through implied associations with terrorism. \nGeneralizations from individual examples in the media, or elsewhere, to wider \npopulation further lead to misunderstandings and ambiguities affecting out-group \nperceptions of students\u2019 identities and their educational destinations (Abbas, 2006).  \nNegative stereotyping and misleading assumptions impact on the young learners\u2019 \naspirations, engagement and motivation (Abbas, 2004; Shah, 2006b). Feagin et al\u2019s \nstudy of black students links low aspirations and underachievement to the persistent \ntheme that \u2018the students were denied respect and humanity\u2019 (1996, p.viii). Riley and \nDocking (2004) discuss self-perceptions of disaffected students stating: \u2018The pupils \nsaw themselves at the bottom of the heap, labelled by teachers as \u2018thick\u2019, \u2018stupid\u2019, not \nwanted in the school\u2019 (p.168); again pointing to the issue of self-esteem and its \ninterplay with performance. Their argument is: \nIf schools are to improve student motivation for learning and to reduce \nbehaviour problems and exclusions, there needs to be an effective dialogue \n[original italics] between staff and students about how to achieve a culture of \nmutual respect, not just one that adheres to rules of conduct. (2004, p.177) \nSome major issues that Muslim students are experiencing today include racism, media \nhostility, association with terrorism, social exclusion, harassment, stereotyping, \nnegative assumptions, religious hatred, and discrimination (Ahmed, 2003; Parekh, \n2000; Richardson, 2004; Vertovec, 2002), which impact on their self-perceptions, \ntheir schooling and experiences in school (Shah, 2006a). Educational leaders need to \ndevelop an organisational culture where minority ethnic learners would feel equal and \nz 7 \nvalued members of the student community. Research and literature provide evidence \nthat leaders with vision (Fullan, 2003), strong moral convictions (Harris et al, 2003) \nand personal values (NCSL, 2005) effectively create inclusive culture leading to \npositive self-images among students and staff from diverse backgrounds, improving \nethnic engagement and performance.  \nEthnic Achievement \nEthnic achievement is a complex issue, highly politicised and riddled with competing \nclaims and contradictions. Tomlinson (1991) rightly argues that despite volumes of \nevidence regarding ethnic achievement\/under-achievement, it is still hard to draw firm \nconclusions. The results of research are often used to fuel political debates: \nA variety of explanations has been offered by researchers attempting to \ndiscover casual factors behind differential levels of achievement between \nmajority and minority pupils, and between different groups of minority pupils. \nThe explanations have often been guesswork, prejudice, or attempts to support \nparticular theories. (Tomlinson, 1991, p.121) \nThe association between under-achievement and certain ethnicities, highlighted by \nstatistics and emphasised by literature, is widely perceived as pointing to a link \nbetween ethnicity\/race and performance\/achievement. Many ethnicities perceive these \nstatistics as sending negative signals about ethnic potential, and discriminatory in \neffect, as it may make people go beyond the evidence to conclude that some groups \nare inherently superior or inferior to others. Such generalizations not only signal \nnegative perceptions of diversity on sociological level, but also ignore structural and \neducational issues.  \nInvestigating and theorising ethnic achievement is challenging, as research suggests \ndiverse and even conflicting evidence with regard to gender, socio-economic \nbackground, school factor, population mix, region, length of stay in Britain, and many \nothers (Abbas, 2004; 2006; Anwar and Buksh, 2002; Haque and Bell, 2001; Modood, \n2003; National Statistics, 2001; OFSTED, 2004). Moreover, Muslims in Britain \noriginate from different countries and cultures, and are ethnically as diverse as Britain \nitself. Second, research points to \u2018significant gaps in the collection of data according \nz 8 \nto faith (data continues to be collected according to ethnicity), particularly in the key \narea of education\u2019 (Abbas, 2006, p.8; also see Modood, 2004; 2005). For example, \nresearch claims that Indian students are by ethnicity high achievers (Abbas, 2006; \nBirmingham City Council, 2005; National Statistics, 2004; OFSTED, 2004). \nHowever, Indians in Britain are composed of three major faith groups - Muslims, \nSikhs and Hindus; and this is an example where in the absence of data according to \nfaith, conclusions can be misleading. \nStatistics say that one third of the Muslim students leave school without any \nqualifications (Abbas, 2004; 2006; Anwar and Buksh, 2002; Haque, 2000; National \nStatistics, 2001). Nevertheless, Muslim students appear to perform better in schools \nwith larger populations of Muslim pupils (Hewer, 2001; NCSL, 2005). Research and \nstatistics highlight that Muslim students perform better in Muslim majority schools \neven when these are poorly resourced Muslim Faith Schools (Hewer, 2001; Lawson, \n2005; Meer, 2007; Parker-Jenkins et al, 2005). Apparently, \u2018the larger the white \ncomponent of their school population the poorer their performance and the lower their \nrelative value added\u2019 (Johnston et al, 2006, p.24). Does this signify that their \nperformance\/achievement is linked with their identity and experiences as Muslims, in \nmain stream schools? \nMany studies point to racism in main stream schools as being one of the key causes of \nlow achievement among ethnic minorities (Gillborn and Mirza, 2000; Troyna, 1991). \nHome Office report confirms that \u2018People from Black and minority ethnic \ncommunities have experienced and continue to experience racism, discrimination, and \ndisadvantage\u2019 (2004, p.4). Abbas claims that in the case of Muslims it is \u2018direct \ndiscrimination, racial hostility and cultural preference (2006, p.17). Another \nexpression of this discrimination is low expectations by teachers of the academic \npotential of the ethnic minority pupils, which is highlighted by many studies (Abbas, \n2004; Gillborn and Youdell, 2002; Haw, 1998) as hampering motivation of these \nstudents and their performance: \n\u2026 teachers associate Muslim students\u2019 problems to culture and fail to identify \nthe structural issue which may affect the children\u2019s performance in the class \nroom. (Abbas, 2006, p.18)  \nz 9 \nStudies of pupil-teacher interaction highlight \u2018how easily children\u2019s self-esteem can \nbe dented by teachers deliberately or unconsciously valuing some pupils more highly \nthan others\u2019 (Munn, 1999, p.121). Blair (2002) critiques the tendency to locate the \nblame for underachievement in students and their communities as it \u2018overlooks the \nrole of schools as institutions, and teachers and head teachers as leaders, in processes \nthat lead to poor student performance\u2019 (p.182). Besides, such associations undermine \npupils\u2019 self-perceptions, and may lead to \u2018social reproduction\u2019 (Bourdieu 1977). \nAbbas argues that cultural reproduction in school context is \u2018the way in which schools \nin association with other social institutions help to perpetuate social and economic \ninequalities\u2019 (2004, p.17), thus pointing to structural issues to be addressed by school \nleaders. OFSTED (2004) comments that where a school has strong leadership, high \nexpectations, effective teaching learning strategies and an ethos of respect with a clear \napproach to racism and bad behaviour, then excellent performance by ethnic minority \npupils can be expected, is thought provoking. The question that emerges here is how \nto create a culture of genuine mutual respect, and a belief of being valued as equals, to \nbuild an environment conducive to ethnic achievement, and to move towards \nincreased engagement in schooling and wider social cohesion. \nAdab: a concept for diversity contexts \nUnderstanding the factors linked with the learners\u2019 performance and addressing these \nis what the learners expect from the schools and from those responsible for leading \nand managing the schools. This expectation is particularly high in the case of Muslim \nstudents because of the discourses surrounding knowledge\/teacher status in Islam \n(Shah 1998; 2006b). In multi-ethnic Britain, there is need for sociological thinking \n(Bauman, 1992) to explore possible conceptual connections to engage diverse groups \nand communities, as a \u2018source of new intellectual and moral energy\u2019 (Parekh, 2004). \nA shared underpinning can guide towards resolving tensions, not by eliminating \ndifferences, but by respecting and integrating diverse philosophies and concepts.  \nO\u2019Brien and Kollock propose that \u2018Spinning imaginative bridges that span existing, \ncontradictory social forms is a first step towards creating new forms of self and \nsociety\u2019 (1997, p.480). Abbas argues that bridging \u2018requires willingness of ethnic \nminorities to connect with society at large but more importantly, the willigness of the \nreceiving society to accept other groups (author\u2019s emphasis)\u2019 (2004, p.23). \nz 10 \nConceptual adaptations from other cultures would reflect this \u2018acceptance\u2019 from the \nhost community, and inspire a sense of \u2018belongingness\u2019 in ethnic minorities, \ncontributing to spinning such imaginative bridges by linking the \u2018different\u2019 towards \ncreating a more cohesive society.  \nThis paper discusses Adab as a concept, drawing attention to the potential of diverse \nknowledge heritages, and highlights that \u2018social capital is generated when individuals \nshare and exchange knowledge, norms, values and behaviour that are reinforced by \ntrust and obligation\u2019 (Abbas 2004, p.20). The primary meaning of the Arabic root of \nword Adab is \u2018to invite\u2019, or \u2018to gather together for a banquet\u2019, and is associated with \nhospitality. It is also explained as \u2018beautiful action\u2019, or \u2018good behaviour\u2019. Adab is a \nconcept with many applications and shades of meaning. It has developed in interplay \nwith different philosophies as Muslim conquests and expansion during the early Islam \nled to contacts with different cultures \u2018whose intellectual heritages were in time \nselectively appropriated by Muslims, then refined and further developed\u2019 (Azim, \n1991, p.111). This integration of diverse intellectual and philosophical legacies \ncontributed to the enrichment of the concept:  \nThe public discourse of Adab, grounded in philosophical and moral language \nand concerns, represents a significant part of the cosmopolitan heritage of \nethics in Islam and reflects efforts to reconcile religiously and scripturally \nderived values with an intellectually and morally based ethical foundation. \n(p.114) \nAdab designates a wide range of social and ethical virtues, including education, \nupbringing, high moral principles and knowledge (Rooke, 1998). It developed in \nresponse to the needs of an expanding and diverse Ummah - the Muslim community \n(Shah, 2006a). Adab is a broad framework for values and behaviour underpinned by \nequality and \u2018hospitality\u2019, finding its strongest expressions in family, community and \neducational contexts. However, because of the scope and primary focus of this paper, \nthe discussion will be limited to leadership values with regard to managing diversity.  \nResearch studies emphasise the significance of leadership values in institutional \ncontexts as contributive to \u2018success\u2019 (Bennett and Anderson, 2003; Harris et al, 2003; \nHopkins, 2001; NCSL, 2005). A growing recognition of \u2018meditation on values\u2019 \nz 11 \n(Greenfield and Ribbins, 1993, p.262) and perception of \u2018Leadership a Moral art\u2019 \n(Hodgkinson, 1991; Sergiovanni, 1992) in leadership literature recognizes this \ndimension by arguing that leaders have to take value-positions: \nNotions of caring, justice and ethics are the foundations \u2026 The actions of the \nleader cannot be separated from the value positions held, for understandings of \n\u2018right\u2019, \u2018wrong\u2019, or even \u2018(not) appropriate\u2019, depend upon recognition of \nindividual world views and beliefs. (Goddard, 2003, p.17)  \nThe onus of value choices appears to be upon \u2018leaders\u2019 or those responsible for \nteaching\/leading. Learners are not actively a part of value choices here and the \nassociated responsibility. Within the Adab framework, the activity is participative and \nmulti-dimensional, and the responsibility is shared. Furthermore, the values \nunderlying Adab are drawn from diverse sources. Its roots and routes are multi-\ncultural as indicated earlier, and therefore associated values can relate to many ethnic \nsocieties, minimising the issue of \u2018whose values\u2019 and \u2018what values\u2019. The increasing \nemphasis on values, ethics and moral leadership, and the growing complexity of \n\u2018multi-ethnic\/cultural\u2019 school contexts indicate the perceived need for a conceptual \nframework complex enough to encompass diversity and shared responsibility, and \nsimple enough to be practicable with a \u2018set of values\u2019 diverse groups could identify \nwith. Adab, as a concept entails such set of values. It also provides a framework for \nharmonization of multiple value-perspectives facilitating interaction, and bonding \ndifferent stakeholders by engaging sociological imagination (Mills, 1992). Adab \nunderpins diverse aspects of relationships, celebrates diversity, supports vulnerability, \nrejects discrimination (racism!), and promotes innate human dignity. It argues for: \n Understanding equality as located in difference \n Respecting difference \n Positive perceptions of self and others \n Sharing and participation \n Giving happiness \nRespect and caring promoted by Adab have the potential to influence attitudes and \npractices in education with implications for inclusion and achievement. Research \nabounds in examples of effect of school and its environment\/culture on how specific \nz 12 \nlearners construct themselves, and the effect of these constructions on learners\u2019 self-\nperceptions and performance. Talking about \u2018experience of victimisation and \nexploitation of ethnic minority people\u2019 (Lynch, 1987, p.4), Lynch explores \n\u2018prejudiced attitudes which may be detrimental to social and educational equity\u2019 \n(1987, p.3). Bourdieu\u2019s (1977) assertion that a psychic sense of one\u2019s place leads one \nto exclude oneself from places from which one is excluded applies to both social and \neducational. Research confirms that experiences of exclusion have negative effect on \nstudents\u2019 self-perceptions, motivation and performance (Gillborn and Mirza, 2000; \nWright, 1998). Perceptions of non-Whites as \u2018invisible, incapable, savage, or exotic\u2019 \n(Rakhit, 1998, p.64), and self-perceptions of not being good enough have negative \nimplications for self-respect. Branden (1997) explains self-respect as \u2018the conviction \nof our own value\u2019, and studies assert that self-respect is an important component of \nself-esteem influencing performance (Walz and Bleuer, 1992).  \nPeople are sensitive to messages about the self (Dweck, 1999, p.143). Dweck argues \nthat the students may lose faith in their ability to succeed due to \u2018lower expectations, \nnegative self-evaluation, negative emotions and feelings of badness \u2026 no matter what \ninclinations the children come with\u2019 (1999, p.107; see also; Abbas, 2004; Gillborn and \nYoudell, 2002; Nieto, 2004). This also points to the role of teachers and leaders in \nstudents\u2019 constructions of self. Gillborn (1998) maintains that \u2018even where teachers \nare conscientious and committed to equality of opportunity as an ideal, they may \nnevertheless act in ways that unwittingly reproduce familiar racial stereotypes, \ngenerate conflict \u2026 and perpetuate existing inequalities of opportunities and \nachievement\u2019 (p.35). The impact of how social is experienced extends to educational \nperformance and self-perception. Self esteem is not just an individual psychological \nconstruct, but is linked to socio-political context. Nieto (2004) argues that: \n\u2018students do not simply develop poor self-concepts out of the blue; rather their \nself-esteem in terms of schooling (original emphasis) is the result of policies \nand practices in schools that respect and affirm some groups while devaluing \nand rejecting others. Students from culturally dominated groups partially \ninternalize some of the many negative messages to which they are subjected \non a daily basis about their culture, ethnic group, class, gender or language\u2019 \n(p.195) \nz 13 \nThis can be one explanation of why one third of the Muslim students leave school \nwithout any qualifications (Abbas, 2004; 2006; Anwar and Buksh, 2002; National \nStatistics, 2001), and second, why they appear to be gravitating towards and operating \nwithin discourses of super-ordinate religious identity and Ummah. Is it to cope with \npowerful discriminatory discourses and \u2018racial frames of reference\u2019 (Donald and \nRattansi 1992, p.1), made more intense in the post 9\/11 sensibilities, and undermining \nself-constructions? In such contexts, concepts like Adab and associated traditions may \nhelp create a \u2018reverse discourses\u2019 (Foucault, 1980) of self-worth leading to positive \nself-perceptions and educational engagement. The social values propounded by \nconcepts like Adab emphasise respect as well as social cohesion. In addition to that, \ndifferences are respected and accommodated, with emphasis on enhancing \nunderstanding. Diverse cultural capital is welcomed and appreciated as contributing to \nsocial capital, perceived both as a cause and outcome of educational achievements. \nConclusion \nThe current emphasis in British government\u2019s policies on \u2018respect for all\u2019 hints at \ncultural intersections, highlighting the significance of redefining the scope and \ninterpretation of different concepts to develop policies and practices more appropriate \nto multiethnic contexts. This could counter \u2018Various mechanisms of social closure \nwhich operate to reproduce existing inequalities\u2019 (Reay et al, 2001, p.854). Negative \nidentity construction and derogatory expressions are examples of mechanisms of \nsocial closure, and these are violations of Adab. In case of such violations, the \ndominant values, practices, assumptions, all may become challenged overtly or \ncovertly, making the educational sites locations for the interplay of competing notions \nand discourses (Foucault, 1980). Adab as a sociological approach proposes to respect \ndiversity, emphasising that everyone has rights and responsibilities in relation to \neveryone else.  \nThe existing approaches such as inclusion, integration, cultural pluralism, \nmulticulturalism, widening participation and celebrating diversity can become mere \ncatchwords if not underpinned by a genuine belief in human equality and respect for \ndifference. For example, in spite of the policy emphasis on \u2018respect for all\u2019 an \ninternational survey of the attitudes of over two thousand fourteen-year-olds to issues \nof citizenship showed that students in England have relatively less positive attitudes \nz 14 \ntowards immigrants than in some other countries (Kerr et al, 2002). Around one third \nof all fourteen-year-olds disagreed with immigrants having rights to speak their own \nlanguage, to have the same rights as everyone else, and to vote in elections after living \nin a country for several years. These attitudes are likely to shape young people\u2019s \ninteractions with peers from other ethnic groups, particularly those from migrant and \nrefugee communities, thus creating an environment where difference is not respected \nor treated as equal. \nAdab is learnt, theorised and practised in relationship contexts, encompassing \neducational, professional, social, political, and others. For example, the intense \nreaction of Muslims to Satanic Verses, or more recently to publication of \nMohammed\u2019s cartoons in a Danish newspaper, was provoked by violation of Adab in \na situation of conflict, evident in the way the Prophet Mohammed and Islam were \ncritiqued - it was not primarily a reaction to critique itself but the manner of critique \n(Abel, 1994, pp.11-22; also see Ruthven, 1991). Adab underpins patterns of behaviour \nfor multi-ethnic Muslim community, and by engaging with the community, this frame \nfor behaviour can be extended to include the wider society. \nThe underlying principles of Adab may have particular resonance within an Islamic \ncontext but they are not exclusively Islamic. First, as mentioned earlier, historically \nthe concept and the associated principles and traditions developed in interaction with \ndifferent civilisations, their philosophies, and intellectual legacies, thus drawing from \nmultiple sources. Second, it has served as a powerful tool for bonding a vastly diverse \ncommunity, with population structures to some extent similar to a multi-ethnic school \ncontext. Third, the two arenas of everyday life where Adab has been and is still a \nvalued tradition for the Muslims, are education and society. The achievements of \nMuslims in the field of knowledge during the early history of Islam (Dozy, 1913; \nShalaby, 1954) are associated with the strong tradition of Adab. This suggests a scope \nfor exploring the applicability of this framework to other diversity contexts. The \nsimilarities between the values associated with Adab and good practice for managing \nethnic diversity emphasise its pertinence for contexts entailing diversity: \n \u2018Beautiful action\u2019 - respecting difference; \n \u2018Sharing\u2019- awareness of the learners\u2019 expectations; \nz 15 \n \u2018Good manners\u2019 - attention to culture-appropriate behaviour\/values; \n \u2018Inviting\u2019- developing inclusive attitudes\/practices; \n \u2018Giving happiness\u2019- providing support and guidance; \n \u2018Hospitality\u2019 - a deeper understanding of concepts such as Adab, honour, \nequality, and difference for responding to diversity. \nThe nearest equivalent to Adab in English language can be \u2018respect\u2019. However, the \nterm \u2018respect\u2019 lacks the depth and scope associated with Adab. Adab has flexibility \nand complexity to be relevant for engaging with diversity, and to inform related \npolicy and practice to contribute towards a multicultural Britishness that is sensitive to \nethnic difference. The underpinning is to incorporate a respect for persons as \nindividuals and for the collectivities that people have a sense of belonging to \n(Modood, 2004). One problem with educatio, and social policies and practices lies in \nthe fact that these often claim to be addressing the needs of particular people while \ntaking little account of those people\u2019s constructions of self or their cultural capital. \nPositive identity constructions, educational achievement and social cohesion are \ninterlinked and can be improved by respecting diversity, by enhancing the students\u2019 \nconfidence in identity and cultural heritage, and by strengthening the notion of \nequality in relationships, and it is proposed that these can be facilitated through \ndrawing upon ethnic knowledge sources and concepts. This engagement can offer \nspaces for convergence of Western and \u2018non-Western\u2019 thought to develop positive \nsocial capital. \nRecent emphasis on getting to know ethnicities, and on multicultural education \n(Nieto, 2004; Luciak, 2006) is another indication of the need to deepen \u2018knowledge \nand appreciation of different cultures, to reduce prejudices, to facilitate critical \nawareness of discrimination and inequalities and to foster the debate about diverse \nculturally based perspectives and practices\u2019 (Luciak, 2006, p73). In spite of its claims \nto be a secular society, British society is perceived as primarily a Western Christian \nsociety. Heated debates over allowing Muslim schools in a country where there are \nmore than 4000 Church of England schools is not perceived by ethnic groups as \nsupporting secular claims or even social justice. The signals are reflected not just in \nthe ceremonial trappings but day-to-day practices, sending messages of exclusion and \nz 16 \nrejection. Efforts to acknowledge and appreciate other perspectives can counter these \nsignals..  \nAt the national and societal levels, there is an effort to engage with diverse ethnic and \nfaith communities to create links leading to more cohesive communities. The policy \nemphasis is \u2018to promote and support ways of bringing together people from different \nbackgrounds in a way that increases understanding and respect\u2019 (Home Office, 2004, \np.17). The tragic events of 9\/11 and 7\/7 have further intensified the need to learn more \nabout diversity, specifically about Islam and Muslims, to develop understanding and \nharmony. This appears to be a point in time when drawing upon diverse philosophies \nand perspectives might be welcomed, or even actively sought in the interest of \neducational enhancement and societal well-being. \n \nReferences \nAbbas, T.
