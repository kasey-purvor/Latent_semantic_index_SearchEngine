On one particular \n[winter] exercise in Otterburn [military training area in the north of England] \na couple of thousand pounds worth of kit disappeared off the back of the truck: \nhe had signed for it [and would therefore get into trouble if it was not \nrecovered]. He spent three days looking for it. He found it three days later \nafter the snow melted.\u201d (Warrant officer2, recalling his time as a private \nsoldier.) \n \n\u201cOne night the sergeant [whom everyone disliked] was asleep in his sleeping \nbag and was woken up as normal for his radio stag [period of duty listening to \n2 \nthe radio]. However, he found that he was stuck \u2013 the bag had twisted round \nand he could not get out. [He called for help but] nobody helped him, and he \nremained stuck. I just put my walkman on and went to sleep.\u201d (Private soldier, \nrecalling a recent event.) \n \n An officer interviewee recalled that he had a friend in a cavalry regiment \nwhich regularly paraded with horses. One of the squadron commanders [with \nthe rank of major] was deeply disliked by the soldiers3 in his squadron for \nputting excessive emphasis on what he saw as \u2018proper high standards\u2019 but \nwhich they saw as unnecessarily messing them about. The soldiers responsible \nfor feeding his horse started to spike the feed with oats, which made the horse \nfriskier. In that regiment it was a shameful thing not to be in complete control \nof your horse and he now found his almost impossible to handle, thus having \nhis personal standards publicly compromised. (Major, recalling recent \nconversation with a colleague.) \n \n These three cases where revenge is meted out to superiors by their juniors are \nrepresentative of a particular issue noted during an extensive insider ethnographic \nstudy of the British Army based in the discipline of Social Anthropology. This issue \nwas the way in which soldiers handled the web of formal rules in which their lives \nwere embedded, obeying some, bending or breaking others.  \n In common with all professional armies and many other organizations, the \nBritish Army is a disciplined force.  Formal rules abound. At the highest level, during \nthe period of the research for this article, these rules are embodied in law, in the form \nof the Army Act 1955, an Act of Parliament officially given to the Army in the \n3 \nManual of Military Law along with associated domestic and international law (or \nreferences to that law), with guidance to avoid ambiguities (MOD, 1972)4.  Below \nthat level come global official documents such as Ministry of Defence level \ninstructions, and at lower levels there are various Standing Orders, Standing \nInstructions, and Standing Operating Procedures which have the status of lawful \norders and which prescribe what is to be done and set limits to the behaviour of \nsoldiers of all ranks. At the most immediate level are the periodically published \nformation and unit \u2018routine orders\u2019 (monthly, weekly, daily) which also have the force \nof a lawful order, but only apply in specified localised contexts, and may be short \nterm. \nTo add to these paper-based rules, it is incumbent on each Service person to \nobey lawful orders given to them in any form by a superior officer. An order can only \nbe unlawful if it violates a previously published order or established national and \ninternational legal codes, so the giving and taking of orders is a regular and constant \nfeature of life in the Army. This is controlled somewhat by the existence of \u2018chains of \ncommand\u2019 which define for each soldier their own set of particular seniors and \njuniors. Thus in most circumstances only those organizationally positioned to do so \nactually give orders to particular soldiers or make rules for them to obey. This formal \napparatus of orders of all kinds is played out through the rank structure which places \neach individual at a particular level in the military organization (Hockey, 1986: 3; von \nZugbach, 1988: 15). \n These rules, concretely articulated via official documents, legal codes, and \nformally required behaviour, are distinct from the informal rules or barely articulated \nbut prescriptive cultural norms that are the subject of, for example, Jack Sidnell\u2019s \n4 \npaper on \u2018rule following\u2019 (2003) though, as we shall see, official rules do not exist in \nisolation from cultural norms and process. \nSo then, what of the three incidents of junior-on-senior revenge above?  All \ninvolve action that seems to challenge or compromise the authority of formally \nsanctioned commanders thus breaking the rules of military discipline. These incidents \ncould well have resulted in a formal disciplinary charge against those involved, under \nSection 69 of the Army Act 1955 (MOD, 1972) (\u2018Conduct to the prejudice of good \norder and military discipline\u2019) although in the event none did. Were these challenges \nto the rules exotic one-offs that fell outside cultural norms or were they in some way \nconsistent with the organizational culture?  What was going on?   \nAn obvious explanation of these events might be that they were acts of \n\u2018resistance\u2019 or \u2018misbehaviour\u2019 or \u2018dissent\u2019.   The topic of rule-violation in \norganizations has been addressed in several disciplines, as Collinson and Ackroyd \nhave shown in their admirable overview (Collinson and Ackroyd, 2005).  They show \nthat, although organizational misbehaviour was recognized from the first, little \nsystematic attention was paid to it before 1950.  Since that date they distinguish \u2018four \ndistinct perspectives; managerialist organizational behavior, labor process, post-\nstructuralism, and feminism\u2019 (2005: 307).  In their conclusion, however, they point \nout that the various social science approaches are by no means unified, use an array of \ndifferent terms, and \u2018draw on a diversity of paradigms\u2019 (2005: 320).   \nNevertheless there is a common thread that runs through much of the literature \non resistance, misbehaviour and dissent in that they are portrayed as taking place in \ncontexts of asymmetry of power.  In essence, they are what Scott calls \u2018weapons of \nthe weak\u2019 (Scott, 1985) in his consideration of actions taken by impoverished manual \nlabourers against land owners newly made rich by a government irrigation project.  \n5 \nThis common thread presupposes a binary opposition between subordinates \n(institutionally or economically weak) and superiors (powerful, with control over the \nconditions in which the weak find themselves), the one subject to domination by the \nother.  It is to be found, for instance, as a strong running theme in Jermier, Knights \nand Nord\u2019s (1994) collection of essays on resistance and power in organizations, \nGouldner\u2019s critique of Weber\u2019s model of bureaucracy based on an ethnography of a \ngypsum plant near the Great Lakes in the USA (1954), and Goffman\u2019s analysis of \npatient and staff behaviour and attitudes to rules in a mental institution (1968).  \nIndeed, it is in the spirit of late twentieth century and early twenty-first century social \nscience to seek out and expose oppression and dominance in many different forms \n(Ortner, 1995) and resistance has been identified and expounded upon in any field \nwhere political or social oppression may be found, including organizations certainly, \nbut going far wider.  Areas that have attracted scholarly attention have included, for \nexample, the oppression of ethnic and political minorities, class and economic \noppression, and gender oppression (see, for a brief sample across time and subject \nmatter, Comaroff, 1985; Ong, 1987; Diamond and Quinby, 1988; Ackroyd and \nThompson, 1999; Fiske and Ginn, 2000; Korovkin, 2000; Ezzamel et al. 2001; \nMarschall, 2002; Ewick and Silbey, 2003). \nThere are traces in some areas of the literature, however, where a putative \nbinary opposition between the powerless and the powerful has received a more \nnuanced approach.  For example, Webb and Palmer\u2019s (1998) analysis of the behaviour \nof workers and supervisors in a Japanese manufacturing \u2018transplant\u2019 in the UK (a \nfactory with British staff using \u2013 at least officially \u2013 Japanese work practices) shows \ndifferent acts of rule-bending\/breaking at different levels of the organization and in \ndifferent circumstances.  Sometimes irregular practices were hidden from supervisors; \n6 \nsometimes supervisors condoned or encouraged them.  The authors also reason that at \ntimes the management must deliberately have allowed (or at least did not stop) \ndeviation from the clearly stated company rules.  Similarly, Collinson\u2019s article on \nsafety and safety practices on North Sea oil installations (1999), shows how directly \nemployed workers, contract workers and supervisors (all of whom had different \nemployment statuses) sometimes cooperated and sometimes acted independently in \nrule bending\/breaking to maintain an acceptable formal safety record. \n  Rule bending\/breaking has, furthermore, been viewed as more than \ndisobedience per se but rather as activity with a wider purpose, a multifaceted set of \nactions that are part of the unofficial dimension to organizational life.  For example, \nsome acts of disobedience have been seen as strategic ways of limiting the success of \nmanagement profit-making activity or as direct action against particular management \npolicy, either of which can form an element in negotiating a concession or an \nindulgent reaction from management, as part of the \u2018effort bargain\u2019 (Flynn, 1916; \nGouldner, 1954; Ackroyd and Thompson, 1999, for example). Others can be seen as \nrites de passage providing a social vector by which newcomers might be put through \nparticular experiences on the road to becoming full members of the working group \n(Collinson, 1988), whilst still others might be interpreted as means whereby \nexperienced skilled workers attempt to maintain their prestige and informal power in \nthe eyes of both management and less skilled workers (see, for instance, Thompson \nand Bannon, 1985).   \nThis article attempts to bring such a socially-based nuanced perspective to rule \nbending\/breaking behaviour in units of the British Army.  In doing so, it adds to a \nvery thin body of academic literature on the organizational culture of that institution.  \nJohn Hockey\u2019s Squaddies: Portrait of a Subculture (1986) was the first attempt to \n7 \ndescribe British soldiers\u2019 culture, comprising an ethnographic account of infantry \nsoldiers in recruit training, then in a formed unit in barracks after training, and finally \non operations in Northern Ireland. It remains one of only a very small number. Since \nSquaddies there have been only six studies that are in any way comparable. These \ncomprise the first part of a wider analysis by Reginald von Zugbach of the position of \nofficers from different regiments in the British Army hierarchy (1988), an attempt to \ncapture British Army culture as it pertained during the Falklands War by Norah \nStewart (Stewart, 1991), Paul Killworth\u2019s PhD thesis on culture and power in the \nBritish Army at infantry platoon level (1997), my work on \u2018social structures\u2019 at unit \nlevel (see for example, Kirke, 2000; 2006; 2009a and 2009b) and Thomas \nThornborrow\u2019s on identity issues in the Parachute Regiment (Thornborrow, 2005). To \nthis short list we should add Anthony King\u2019s article (2006) on bonding in the British \ninfantry which, although narrowly focused on military operational practice, adds \nsomething to our understanding of military culture.  Of these, Hockey\u2019s work is the \nmost directly relevant to the subject of this article.  His principal theoretical \ncontribution is the characterization of what he calls the \u2018negotiated order\u2019 in the \nArmy, drawing on earlier work by Strauss et al (1974).  He notes that private soldiers \nhave the capacity to make officers and NCOs look less competent by carrying out \nwhat he calls \u2018unofficial\u2019 activity. In response, officers and NCOs protect themselves \nby avoiding making life unnecessarily difficult for the privates.  \u2018Negotiated order\u2019 as \nHockey sees it thus exists in the space between the formal power of the officers and \nNCOs and the potential for the private soldiers to make life difficult for them, which \nwould include acts of revenge as in the cases above. In short, this is resistance with a \npurpose \u2013 to change the application of power by the powerful. Hockey\u2019s main \ncontribution in this area is therefore to show how apparently powerless individuals \n8 \nand groups at the bottom of the British military hierarchy can act effectively against \nthose with institutional power to curb their use of that power. The case of the major\u2019s \nhorse, for example, could be seen as a reaction by his soldiers to their officer\u2019s \nbehaviour towards them: in making him appear to have low standards of competence \nhimself they were undermining his main thrust for \u2018proper high standards\u2019 and thus \nraising the stakes in the negotiation. \nAn outsider may be forgiven for concluding that an individual soldier\u2019s life is \nso hedged about with formal rules that he or she has little choice about how to behave \nand what to do next. For example, various orders and instructions will specify what \ntime to get up, what to wear, where and when to eat, whom to obey, whom to salute, \nhow to salute, what to do whilst on duty and  the limits of behaviour off duty. Failing \nto obey such orders can be expected to lead to disciplinary action which might result a \nperiod of limited freedom, a fine, or confinement in the unit guardroom. To reinforce \nthis view the rank and command structure is one of the most visible elements of \nBritish Army culture, representing the apparently all-pervading elements of discipline \nand authority. \n  The system of formal rules, however, is only one element in the wider social \nsystem in a British military unit. Other elements comprise a rich informal culture \n(\u2018unofficial\u2019 in Hockey\u2019s terms) far removed from the shouting foot-stamping order-\ngiving image in the popular imagination, a deep concern with professional soldierly \nbehaviour (expressed in many forms from simple tasks like lighting a fire in the rain \nto highly complex activities such as operating an armoured fighting vehicle in a close \nbattle), and a practical and emotional engagement with the military group, its identity \nand its reputation. This cultural melange of formal, informal, professional and identity \nsystems is played out in a continuously shifting transition between these elements and \n9 \nthrough a set of networks of personal relationships which provide media for \ninteraction that transcend the apparent strictures of the rank and discipline system \n(described in detail in Kirke, 2006 and 2009b). To understand rule bending and rule \nbreaking in this wider social system, therefore, we need to look closely at further \nexamples and the social and organizational interactions that flow around them. \n This article is based on my research in the British Army. It was an unusual \nstudy in that data were collected over an extended time (thirty years) from an insider \nposition as a full member of the organization (as a commissioned officer in the Royal \nArtillery). The methodology of the study involved participant observation (living the \nculture) accompanied by the creation of fieldnotes (in the form of a private journal) \nand the assemblage of personal memories in retrospect, all of which included \nobservations and analysis of interactions, informal relationships, material culture and \nsummaries of the incidents that occurred in the normal processes of daily life.  What \nstarted as a self-motivated personal study became formalized in a year\u2019s research at \nthe Department of Social Anthropology at Cambridge in 1993\/4 and subsequent work \ntowards a PhD, both of which included extended conversations and in-depth semi-\nstructured interviews and visits to a wide range of units.  Data were organized and \nanalyzed using a qualitative data package, NUD*IST 6,5 to discover patterns in the \ndata, regularities and recurring themes that led to conclusions about aspects of the \nArmy\u2019s organizational culture.  Because of my status as an insider researcher the \nprocess involved a great deal of reflexive thought.  This thought revolved mainly \naround the effect of my presence as both a researcher and a participant with an \nauthority status, the advantages I had in being able to identify nuances that might have \neluded a na\u00efve researcher, and the disadvantages that came with diminished \nobjectivity \u2013 a lack of \u2018stranger value\u2019 (Beattie, 1966: 87).  These considerations had \n10 \nsomething in common with the issues identified by Higate and Cameron (2006), when \nthey comment on the attempt in their research \u2018to complement the dominant scientific \napproach through reflecting on our involvement in a qualitative research project\u2019.  In \nshort, I had to pursue a very personal trajectory in tuning the minutiae of the research \nactivity to attempt to mix deep immersion in the field with at least a degree of social \nscientific detachment.    \n In the absence of any formally articulated social anthropological code of ethics \nin 1974 at the start of this project, the driving ethical principle was to \u2018do no harm\u2019, \ncombined with a commitment to keep private the identities of those concerned, and \nthese have been retained as underlying self-imposed attitudes as various ethical codes \nhave emerged.6 Nobody was at any stage compelled to answer questions, all \ninformation was treated as in confidence, and informed consent was obtained \nwhenever practicable.  For these reasons all names in this article have been changed \nto pseudonyms to preserve anonymity, as has the contextual information surrounding \nmany of the cases stated. \n It should be emphasized that although I was a member of the British Army this \narticle does not necessarily reflect official opinion or thought. It is an entirely \nindependent view. \n \nNavigating in a Sea of Rules \nOn my first day as the Regimental Signals Officer in a Royal Artillery \nregiment, recently appointed and fresh out of university via a three-month long \ntechnical course on regimental signals, I was introduced by my troop sergeant-major \n(\u2018TSM\u2019), WO 2 Daniel Wilson (a warrant officer of some fourteen years\u2019 service) to \nmy signals sergeant, Sgt Mick Parish, in his work-place, the battery7 signals store. He \n11 \nwas known to be an able and effective sergeant and a good man to have in this \nposition, which was both technically and organizationally demanding. My status as a \njunior officer who had only a small amount of regimental experience, all of it outside \nthe field of regimental signals, was something akin to a management trainee. \nAlthough I had a rank that exceeded the sergeant major\u2019s by three levels and Sergeant \nParish\u2019s by two more, I was expected to defer to their experience and professional \ncompetence. I was frequently told that just because I had done a long course I was not \nyet a professional Royal Artillery signaller and that I still had a lot to learn. On the \nother hand, there was an expectation (articulated by my Battery Commander (\u2018BC\u2019 \u2013 a \nmajor) and Commanding Officer (\u2018CO\u2019 \u2013 a lieutenant colonel)) that I would provide \nleadership to my troop and some indefinable and somewhat ethereal attributes that \nwere brought by officers rather than warrant officers or senior NCOs. In a barely \narticulated way it was up to me to listen to and respect my soldiers\u2019 expertise but \nnevertheless to take the important decisions and provide inspiration and set standards \nof both professional and personal behaviour. At the same time, I was expected to \nprovide pastoral care to my men, supervised formally by my BC and informally by his \nbattery sergeant major. In other words, I was in the typical position of a junior officer. \nHaving shaken Sgt Parish\u2019s hand, I glanced round the store. The room was \nabout twenty feet square with polished bare floorboards and two large windows, but \nthe first thing that struck me was the dense array of metal \u2018dexion\u2019 shelving all \nregularly spaced with each shelf devoted to a different type of communications \nequipment. Radios were all in one place, interface boxes in another, cabling was \nneatly sorted, stacked, tied and tagged. Aerials (\u2018antennas\u2019 to the initiated) were \nstacked in sections, close by the square boxes known as \u2018tuams\u2019 into which they \nconnected. There were packs of D10 black plastic-insulated twisted pair copper wire \n12 \n(\u2018line\u2019), and line-laying equipment. Everything was clean and in order and \naccompanied by an unmistakable and familiar background smell that seems to have \nbeen present in every military store I have ever been in, a universal piece of military \nalchemy somehow blending traces of floor polish, tarpaulins, military clothing and \nmetal.  \nOne area seemed strangely different from the rest. High on a shelf at the back \nof the store was a cardboard carton, from the top of which jutted evidence of jumble \nrather than the order that pertained elsewhere. I could see the corner of a tuam and a \npiece of cabling with a substantial plug on the end, and something that might have \nbeen a D10 cable pack. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Sergeant Parish?\u201d I asked. I could see him \nexchange a glance with the Sergeant Major, who spoke first. \u201cIt\u2019s Sergeant Parish\u2019s \nbuckshees8, Sir. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d  \u2018Buckshee\u2019 was the term we used for any \nsurplus items that were not accounted for in the official ledgers or \u2018books\u2019. \nSome days later, in the twilight of the end of the working day, I saw Sgt Parish \nand one of the junior NCOs in my troop carrying that cardboard box towards a \nlandrover9. I asked them what they were doing. \u201cThe QM (Tech) is inspecting my \nstore tomorrow, Sir\u201d, Sgt Parish said cheerfully. \u201cWe can\u2019t have him setting his eyes \non my buckshees!\u201d.  I had previously seen the Commanding Officer\u2019s routine order \npublishing the formal inspection of all stores by the two regimental quartermasters, \n(one of whom, the Technical Quartermaster) was known as \u2018the QM (Tech)\u2019).  These \nofficers, captains commissioned from the ranks, were responsible to the CO for all the \nequipment in the regiment. The order had specifically said that everything in all the \nstores was to be counted, and all surpluses and deficiencies were to be declared. Our \nSignals Troop surpluses comprised the very buckshees that were now being hidden \naway, and so here was Sergeant Parish openly disobeying this official order. I was his \n13 \ntroop commander, formally responsible not only for the troop and its equipment but \nfor its standards of conduct and propriety, and nobody had discussed this breach of \nofficial instructions with me. What should I do?  I had only a moment either to give \nSgt Parish and his assistant a firm order to return the buckshees to the stores, or by not \ndoing anything to let them continue to squirrel the kit away.  I was an officer and so \nhad a duty to uphold the rules and tell him to put the buckshees back, but Sgt Parish \nwas not behaving as if he was breaking any rules. What was going on? \nI let them get on with concealing the buckshees, but I needed to find out the \nrights and wrongs of the case so I went to see my TSM to discuss it with him and gain \nhis advice. When he had heard my tale he laughed out loud and said, \u201cYou would \nhave made a complete arse of yourself there, Sir, if you had stopped Sergeant Parish. \nYou did the right thing to leave him alone.\u201d  \u201cBut the order said that surpluses had to \nbe declared\u2026\u201d. \u201cI know that, Sir, but the QM (Tech) knows perfectly well that all the \nbuckshees in all the stores in the regiment are being hidden away right now. He was a \nsergeant in charge of a store himself once and he knows exactly what\u2019s going on. And \nanyway, how could Sergeant Parish manage without his buckshees?\u201d \nIt was thus that I discovered the regular hidden trading between stores holders \nin the regiment. If a piece of equipment became lost it was as often as not replaced by \nundeclared exchange of buckshees between the stores holder and a colleague in a \ndifferent battery, as a \u2018favour\u2019. And one favour always begat another favour in due \ncourse in a continuing unofficial process that carried on ceaselessly within the \nregiment. Buckshees were garnered whenever possible, for example by getting \n\u2018replacements\u2019 for undamaged equipment by \u2018writing it off\u2019 at the end of large \nexercises, or by bidding for new issues to replace sound items that had supposedly \nbeen worn out, and occasionally by finding and keeping abandoned items on training \n14 \nareas. All of this was done with the agreement of the authority figures in each battery \nas part of the weft and warp of normal life, even though it was against the formal \nrules.  \nHowever, official tolerance of the creation and maintenance of buckshees \nstopped at the highest level, in the form of the two quartermasters. Although they \nknew about the process, having, as my TSM had said, traded in buckshees themselves \nonce, from their current point of view it was inefficient and caused waste for which \nthey were ultimately responsible to the CO. When the unofficial management of \nstores became gross, they intervened, as I discovered later in my first year as \nRegimental Signals Officer. A land rover trailer belonging to my troop was lost in a \nfire with all its contents which had therefore to be written off. This was a golden \nopportunity for Sgt Parish to create a significant horde of buckshee stores by \nexaggerating the number of items lost and he threw himself into the task with \u00e9lan. I \nand my BC (partaking in some of Sgt Parish\u2019s glee) endorsed this exaggerated bid, \nbut it was returned by the QM (Tech) with a laconic note saying that all these things \ncould not possibly be fitted into a single trailer \u2013 he had tried it. We pleaded a clerical \nerror and submitted a more modest, and successful, bid with less exaggeration. \nWhilst Hockey\u2019s model of negotiated order could be used to examine the cases \nof revenge at the top of this article, it may not be so useful in considering the case of \nSgt Parish\u2019s buckshees. Whereas Sgt Parish might certainly have nursed a grudge \nagainst his na\u00efve young officer if I had made him declare his buckshees and he could \nhave made life awkward for me subsequently, this never arose. In contrast, the chain \nof command within the battery cooperated strongly with his attempts to preserve his \nbargaining power with his opposite numbers in other batteries by allowing him to hide \nthe offending articles. Whilst the idea of negotiated order could be applied to the \n15 \ncorporate relationship between the battery and the Quartermaster\u2019s Department, it \nwould not serve to illuminate what was going on within the battery. \nErving Goffman provides a more appropriate model than negotiated order in \nAsylums, his masterly work on life in what he calls \u2018total institutions\u2019 (1968).  He  \ndefines such institutions as \u2018\u2026 a place of residence and work where a large number of \nlike-situated individuals, cut off from the wider society for an appreciable period of \ntime, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life.\u2019 (1968: 11). His \nbase case is a lunatic asylum, but he also cites examples of life in other enclosed \nplaces such as monasteries and military units. Whilst present day British military units \nare not as isolated as they were when Goffman wrote Asylums, they still manifest \nmany of the defining characteristics of his concept of total institutions. Unlike many \nsocial groupings, military units have clearly defined physical and social boundaries, \nmembership is unambiguous and the members both work and live together. As Kier \nsays of the US military, it \u2018creates an encompassing environment, integrated around \ncollective goals and relatively isolated from civilian life\u2019 (1999: 29). Within that \nenvironment, the round of life is enclosed and formally administered (at least during \nthe working day), and barracks provide a place of residence for large numbers of like-\nminded individuals, all characteristics that Goffman attaches to a total institution. The \nresemblance to such an institution is more marked when units are deployed on \ntraining or operations because they move as discrete bodies from their home to an \nalien environment (where it is indeed isolated) while retaining their identity and \nstructure. \n  Goffman devotes a complete essay to what he calls \u2018underlife\u2019, informal or \nunofficial activity within the institution (1968:157-280), in which he makes a \ndistinction between \u2018primary\u2019 and \u2018secondary\u2019 adjustments. Primary adjustments \n16 \nconsist in the co-operation of the individual in what the institution formally requires, \nwhereas secondary adjustments belong to the informal world: they \u2018represent ways in \nwhich the individual stands apart from the role and the self that were taken for granted \nfor him by the institution\u2019 (1968: 172). Goffman makes a further distinction between \n\u2018disruptive\u2019 secondary adjustments, which are aimed at rupturing the smooth running \nof the organization, and \u2018contained\u2019 secondary adjustments, which fit into existing \ninstitutional structures and make life easier without introducing pressures for radical \nchange or challenging the existing system. \nThe incident with the buckshees exactly follows this pattern. Behaviour that \nwas against the formal rules was taking place to make life easier for those involved, a \nclassic contained secondary adjustment. Indeed, the individual actions that comprise \nthe negotiations in negotiated order, including cases of revenge as described above, \ncan also be viewed as secondary adjustments, \u2018contained\u2019 for the most part as they \ntend not to involve open defiance or disobedience. Goffman\u2019s model thus seems to \nprovide a useful framework. \nThere remains, however, an issue that is not fully addressed simply by \napplying Goffman\u2019s model of \u2018adjustments\u2019. The three cases of informal revenge can \nbe distinguished from the case of Sgt Parish\u2019s buckshees because that case involved \nthe informal endorsement and approval of agents of authority in the form of myself \nand, post facto, the TSM. Similarly, Sgt Parish\u2019s exaggeration of the contents of the \ntrailer had the formal endorsement of both myself and the BC. Whilst all of these \nincidents involved a deliberate infringement of the rules, there appears to be a \ndifference in quality between the first three and the latter two because of the \nendorsement by authority figures who had a duty to stop Sgt Parish but chose not to.   \n17 \nWhy might authority figures endorse this activity, then?  For some, of course, \nwe may presume that they might not be prepared to put in the effort to cause a \nconfrontation or risk its consequences \u2013 a factor that would add power to the private \nsoldiers\u2019 negotiating position described in Hockey\u2019s Squaddies (1986).   But other, \norganizational cultural-based, reasons could very well apply.  For example, the \npowerful attitudes, expectations and assumptions connected to identity with, and \nloyalty to, the organizational segment in question would lead members of that \nsegment to have a common interest in enhancing or preserving its reputation and \neffectiveness.  Where the rule bending\/breaking activity not only made life easier for \nthose concerned, therefore, but also contributed to the military success or reputation \nof the relevant organizational segment, then tacit or open endorsement by authority \nfigures might well follow.  In this case, the authority figures in the battery were \nprepared to bend the truth about the contents of the burned trailer because it would \nprovide more buckshees for Sgt Parish to trade with, and thus help to ensure that, as \nan organization, we would be well placed to have everything we needed for training \nplus extra bargaining power with the other batteries.   \nIn order to add further value to the analysis of incidents of rule bending and \nrule breaking behaviour in the Army, therefore, we need to go beyond Goffman\u2019s \nmodel. The expansion proposed here is the decomposition of \u2018secondary adjustments\u2019 \ninto a further sub-category: those that are \u2018OK\u2019 in the perception of those carrying \nthem out (\u2018legitimate secondary adjustments\u2019) and those that are \u2018not-OK\u2019 \n(\u2018illegitimate secondary adjustments\u2019). If we take the examples described so far, the \nthree cases of revenge at the top of this article were obvious illegitimate secondary \nadjustments, and Sgt Parish\u2019s use of buckshees and his attempt to generate more \n18 \nthrough the exaggerated write-off claim following the fire were treated as legitimate \nsecondary adjustments by his superiors in the battery. \n In the process of every day Army life, whether an unofficial activity is \nendorsed as \u2018OK\u2019 or not lies in the hands of the agents of authority in the particular \ncontext. Thus, in an unofficial way, the command system manages what might be \ncalled \u2018OK-ness\u2019 in terms of rule breaking and bending. Knowledge of which \nactivities are in which category is crucial to the subordinate agents in the military \ngroup as they define the limits of approved activity in daily life \u2013 the extent to which \nrules can be bent or broken without attracting official censure. This in turn means that \nformal rank and formal power impose an obligation on those with authority to signal \nthe limits of \u2018OK-ness\u2019, however subtly or indirectly.   \nIn the mid 1970s the Army was generally badly paid. For example, several of \nthe married soldiers in my troop were drawing rent rebate from the Government \nbecause their pay did not meet the minimum officially defined level for their housing \ncost, yet they were housed by the Government in official married quarters. Several \nsoldiers, married and single, fell into debt and it was one of my many pastoral tasks as \na junior commander to help them manage their way out of their situation. It was not \neasy: we had little financial room for manoeuvre.  \nNevertheless, for everyone there was potentially an unofficial bonus through \nthe medium of travel claims. At that time, each soldier was allowed to make four \nreturn car journeys on leave at public expense each year and it was simplicity itself to \ngain extra cash by exaggerating the length of these journeys and claiming bogus \nmotor mileage10. It became a fairly general secondary adjustment in a particular unit. \nThe pay staff, who managed the day-to-day financial matters in the regiment, were \ntacitly compliant, thus letting it be understood that these exaggerated motor mileage \n19 \nclaims were \u2018OK\u2019 as long as they were plausable; in other words that they were \nlegitimate secondary adjustments11. \nSuddenly, however, there was a catastrophic change. The Royal Military \nPolice investigated some highly optimistic claims and found them to be false. The \ndiscovery of such offences was followed up by an investigation of the validity of past \ntravel claims and a small number of soldiers were prosecuted for fraud. Their careers \nwere ended and they were discharged in disgrace. The extreme unfairness of this \napparent scapegoating struck us all, but nobody wanted to talk about it. Business went \non as usual but the habitual exaggeration of travel claims stopped. \nThis sudden shift from unofficial tolerance of what had become a recognized \nperquisite to ruthless official prosecution demonstrates that \u2018OK-ness\u2019 and \u2018not OK-\nness\u2019 are not necessarily stable categories. Unofficially defined as they are by agents \nof formal authority, the permanent background presence of the formal apparatus of \npower and punishment allows those agents or their superiors to use that apparatus to \nchange the definitions at any time.  \nA further complication arises concerning the appropriate authority figure to \ndefine the legitimacy or otherwise of any particular secondary adjustment. Sgt Parish, \nfor example, was under the authority of my TSM, myself, and the BC. In theory, any \nof us could have given him different definitions of \u2018OK\u2019 when it came to the \ntreatment of buckshees. In practice, we all spoke with the same voice so the issue did \nnot arise. What bound us in this same voice was the organizational culture of the \nbattery, which provided our resource for defining correct and incorrect practice. But \nwhat if we had had different perceptions of OK and not-OK? \nCaptain Giles Puttenham was an officer in an artillery battery during the later \nstages of the Cold War. This battery had a standing order that the steel helmet was to \n20 \nbe worn during all phases of tactical exercises, although the operationally relaxed \nCold War ambience was such that the wearing of helmets was considered by many \nunits as excessively \u2018war-y\u201912. However, there were some individuals who took their \noperational role very seriously and it was Capt Puttenham\u2019s fate to find himself \nserving under one of these.  The helmet was an uncomfortable and heavy piece of \nequipment that put strain on the neck and Capt Puttenham hated it.  \nHis role in the battery was as an \u2018OP Officer\u2019, leading a small party of soldiers \n(his \u2018OP party\u2019) that was routinely split off from the main body and deployed some \ndistance away in an isolated spot. On one exercise he gave his soldiers permission to \ntake off their helmets and wear berets instead, thus making it a legitimate secondary \nadjustment for his soldiers: although it was against the rules it was \u2018OK\u2019 because their \nauthority figure had given them permission to break the particular rule.  However, \nwhen the BC visited this small group he took Captain Puttenham aside and told him \nfirmly to obey the standing order and get his, and his OP party\u2019s helmets on. \nPuttenham apologized to his superior and did so. However, after the BC left, he told \nhis soldiers to put off their helmets and resume their berets but now to keep a good \nlook-out for the next visit of the BC. With early warning they could get their helmets \nback on again easily enough. From now on, as far as Puttenham was concerned this \nwas an illegitimate secondary adjustment because he would get into trouble if he was \nfound out, but as far as his men were concerned it was still legitimate as their \nimmediate authority figure had given them permission to do it. \nIncidents like these introduce a new layer of complexity in the understanding \nof rule observation in the Army. Although the authority agent is a key figure in any \nincident, the effective agent of authority can change with the context.  For instance, \nhad the QM(Tech) arrived at the moment when I was allowing Sgt Parish to load his \n21 \nbuckshees into the landrover then my authority would have been trumped by his and \nsomething that was passing by default as \u2018OK\u2019 would instantly have become \u2018not-\nOK\u2019. Even the BC would have been unable to help Sgt Parish because the QM (Tech) \nwould have been a formal agent of the CO\u2019s authority. \nWhen I was undergoing the training course to equip me (at least technically) \nto be the Regimental Signals Officer I found myself alone as a commissioned officer \namong my fellow students who were all junior NCOs of the rank of bombardier (a \nRoyal Artillery rank equivalent to corporal in the rest of the Army). They were on a \n\u2018regimental instructors\u2019 course which had an identical syllabus to the \u2018regimental \nsignals officers course\u2019 so I and they were amalgamated into a single body of \nstudents. This meant that I was with individuals who had knowledge and experience \nin the field of signals which I completely lacked. One of the modules in the course \nconcerned the planning and setting up of a local telephone network, involving the use \nof a portable telephone exchange and the laying of D10 telephone cable to separate \n\u2018subscribers\u2019. What was called \u2018line laying\u2019 involved spooling out cable from a \nstandard D10 drum while standing up at the back of a moving vehicle, and managing \nit with a wire guide on the end of a stick. Whenever the drum of D10 was used up, a \nnew one had to be connected using copper joints and clamped with \u2018crimpers\u2019 (a \nspecialist object something like a pair of pliers) which took a minute or so to do: the \nprocess was known as \u2018jointing\u2019.  \nThe last element in the \u2018Line Module\u2019 was an exercise on a Friday to allow us \nto practise what we had learned with the real equipment on a relatively wide scale on \nSalisbury Plain. In pairs, we had to lay a prodigious amount of cable in the morning (a \nremarkably quick process and highly enjoyable), connect it to a field telephone at \nabout lunch time and take part in a brief communications exercise via the manual \n22 \nexchange to test the network. At the end of the exercise we had to recover the cable \n(still in our pairs) by winding it back manually onto the empty drums, a much slower \nprocess than spooling it out. It was by now well into the afternoon, the weekend \ncalled, and I and my companion were going to be late. Worse still, the cable, which \nhad started the day tightly coiled, now did not wind back easily and soon became \ntangled. This required us to cut the wire, untangle it, and then joint it again making \nthe process agonizingly slow. Friday was often referred to as \u2018Poets Day\u2019 (\u2018pack up \nearly tomorrow\u2019s Saturday\u2019) and this delay began seriously to rankle as there would \nbe no possibility of packing up early today. After a time my companion suggested that \ninstead of jointing the cable we should simply tie the cut ends together. I said that we \nshould not do that because it would render the cable useless \u2013 it would lose its \nelectrical continuity. A discussion then ensued in which he told me that it was \ncommon practice to tie cable and that we were being foolish in jointing every break, \nand anyway it was Friday afternoon. I too was feeling the loss of the Friday evening \nand so, supposedly bowing to his greater experience, I agreed that from then on we \nwould tie the cut ends rather than jointing them. Speed increased and we were able to \nget away in reasonably good time in the end, even if we had wrecked the cable. The \nother pairs had made similarly speedy progress, so it appeared that they had used \nsimilar methods, though nobody mentioned it. \nIn this case we can see an authority figure - myself, a commissioned officer - \nmaking a rule and issuing a lawful order \u2013 joint the cable \u2013 finding himself having his \norder questioned by a junior individual who suggests a secondary adjustment \u2013 tie the \ncable. He makes the case that he is suggesting a legitimate secondary adjustment \nbecause it is \u2018common practice\u2019. The authority agent then changes his mind and \naccepts the suggestion.  \n23 \nThis incident introduces a new factor. Whilst authority figures may be \ntrumped by more senior agents in the hierarchy they may also be unsure of their \nground and open to negotiation or persuasion. In this case we see that the categories \nof \u2018OK\u2019 and \u2018not-OK\u2019 are being negotiated, the junior individual appealing to his \ngreater experience to lend weight to his negotiations. This, inter alia, highlights the \ncultural value given to experience: decisions may be the province of the senior person \nbut the senior person is also obliged to listen to the voice of experience in making that \ndecision. In sum, the room for manoeuvre for the individual does not therefore have to \nend with the declaration by authority agents of what is and is not \u2018OK\u2019: the junior can \nstill have a voice with their senior. \nSecond Lieutenant Justin Saxby was an objectionable young man. He had \njoined his military organization after his officer cadet training at the Royal Military \nAcademy Sandhurst but there were some months to wait before the required specialist \nprofessional course. As is usual under such circumstances he was sent to an infantry \nbattalion to learn about life at regimental duty13. He was given command of a platoon \nfor the duration of his stay with the battalion and seemed set for an enjoyable few \nmonths. His platoon, as was normal, comprised three infantry sections of eight or nine \nmen14 commanded by corporals, and a platoon sergeant who saw it as his job to \neducate him in the ways of the Army and \u2018bring him on\u2019.  He refused to learn, \nhowever, from his platoon sergeant or to take his advice in any way, believing \napparently that his training at Sandhurst had given him all he needed to know. He \ninfuriated his soldiers by, as they saw it, messing them about with poorly-conceived \ntraining that they did not need; he was rude and arrogant to his fellow-officers, and he \nmade a habit of bawling his men out whenever an opportunity presented itself. He \n24 \nmay have thought that he was demonstrating firm authority but those around him \nthought he was showing himself to be an idiot and a liability. \nOne of the NCOs in the Company Headquarters, Lance Corporal \u2018Nosher\u2019 \nPaulson, was responsible for the radio communications within the company. 2Lt \nSaxby made a particular enemy of him, giving him several undeserved \u2018bollockings\u2019 \nover the radio net for lack of professionalism which incensed him. LCpl Paulson was \ncalled \u2018Nosher\u2019 for good reason as he was known to become aggressive and punchy \nwhen drunk, though he had recently been sufficiently restrained to stay out of trouble \nlong enough to rise to the rank of lance corporal. One evening there was a company \nparty, a celebration of the company\u2019s identity, at which all members were present. \nLCpl Paulson became nastily drunk during the later stages of this celebration, his \nfriends afterwards saying that this was a deliberate act to give him an \u2018excuse\u2019 for \nwhat he was about to do. Drunk as he was, he managed to corner 2Lt Saxby and \nattacked him violently, landing several painful punches before he was dragged off and \nplaced in one of the cells in the guard room. \nKnowing that LCpl Paulson had been behaving himself for some time, the CO \ncalled in his Company Commander before going through the inevitable formal \nsummary jurisdiction process \u2013 inevitable because no NCO can expect to get away \nwith hitting a commissioned officer. The CO wanted to know the antecedents to the \nincident to gauge how seriously it should be treated, so he asked the Company \nCommander why the Paulson had done it. The Company Commander replied \n\u201cBecause he got there before I did\u201d and he gave a full explanation of the thoroughly \nbad behavior of the young officer. \nLCpl Paulson was charged with a comparatively minor offence that did not \nrequire him to undergo a Court Martial, which would almost certainly have resulted in \n25 \nhim being discharged from the Army. The Commanding Officer found him guilty of \nthis charge and reduced him to the rank of private, with consequent loss of pay and \nstatus. However, within six months he was reinstated as a lance corporal and restored \nto his post (in a very short time in Army career terms). 2Lt Saxby was quickly posted \naway from the battalion. \nThis appears at first sight to have been a disruptive secondary adjustment, a \npiece of high octane dissent. A serious offence is committed in front of many \nwitnesses, and is followed up by summary jurisdiction and formal punishment. \nHowever, the incident was not dealt with as seriously as it might have been. \nEssentially, the authorities only went as far as they had to: they went through the \nmotions of discipline and punishment whilst ensuring that LCpl Paulson suffered as \nlittle as possible. They used their empowerment to mitigate the punishment according \nto an unofficial assessment of justice for the corporal and just deserts for the officer \n(physical injury and speedy removal from the battalion). \n \nDiscussion \nThe cases set out in this article suggest that, however firm and clear the rules \nmay appear, their observance and enforcement by the agents involved needs to be \nseen as part of a culturally-informed process played out in the context of everyday \norganizational life. The British Army appears to be a particularly interesting milieu \nfor research in this area because of its public image as a rule-based total institution.  \nThe evidence is that British soldiers\u2019 lives are not rigidly rule-dominated, that \nrules are bent or broken or managed in certain circumstances with and without the \napproval of authority agents. Indeed, there is an expectation that they will be bent or \nbroken at certain times as we saw in the case of Sgt Parish\u2019s buckshees. In essence, \n26 \nrules have the appearance of the absolute but they lose their absoluteness as they are \nplayed out in the complex processes of daily life.  In spite of this complexity, and in \nparticular the multiplicity and the changeability of the variables, soldiers navigate the \nmaze of rule obedience rule avoidance and rule breaking with apparent ease in the \ncourse of their daily lives at regimental duty. Such things are absorbed into the \nprocesses of daily life and acted upon and played out in the exercise of practical sense \nacquired through those very processes (see Bourdieu\u2019s painstaking descriptions of this \nprocess, 1990). \nFigure One is a model that attempts a unifying framework of analysis for rule \nbending\/breaking in the Army, based on the various aspects brought forward in this \narticle.  It seeks to capture Goffman\u2019s logical distinctions between primary and \nsecondary adjustments, contained and disruptive secondary adjustments, and this \narticle\u2019s expansion into the legitimate and illegitimate contained secondary \nadjustments.  It also offers a means to locate the role of the authority agent in defining \nthem, and the potential for negotiations between junior and senior, as these logical \ndistinctions are played out in the processes of every day life. \n27 \nPrimary Adjustments  Secondary Adjustments \n(obeying the rules)    (bending\/breaking the rules) \n           \n \nContained Disruptive \n     (rule bending\/breaking (open action that will  \n     That may or may not lead to official  \n     lead to official action) punishment) \n    \n \n \nLegitimate secondary adjustments \n\u2018OK\u2019 in the context in which they are \ncarried out \nIllegitimate secondary adjustments \n\u2018Not OK\u2019 in the context in which they are \ncarried out \n \n          Defined by Authority Agent(s) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nLines [              ] indicate logical (cognitive) distinctions \nArrows [               ] indicate action and\/or social process \n(Author\u2019s diagram, developed from Goffman\u2019s characterization) \n \nFigure One: Primary and Secondary Adjustments \n \nMediated by \nnegotiation \nMediated by \nnegotiation \nObserved rule bending\u2019 \nbreaking behaviour \n \nPerceived \nby \nsubordinate \nagents \n28 \n \n This framework, however, begs an important question, a sort of \u2018elephant in \nthe room\u2019 \u2013 a presence that everyone can see but is not commented upon \u2013 that lurks \nbeneath all the cases so far. It may be possible to observe that rule bending and rule \nbreaking are present in the Army, and trace their anatomy by the use of frameworks, \nbut in an apparently rule-based organization, why are rules broken or bent in the first \nplace? \n Simple logic suggests that there is no single reason. In some cases, such as the \nfirst three cited and the case of LCpl Paulson, the rule-breaker is taking revenge on a \nsuperior, analogous to a personal act of sabotage. However, we need to go beyond this \nfirst level of analysis. Why did the perpetrators want to sabotage the well-being of \ntheir superiors?  It is interesting that in all four cases they were reacting against what \nthey appear to have seen as an abuse of formal authority. The \u2018old school\u2019 sergeant \nwas over-strict with his men; everyone disliked the sergeant who became tangled in \nhis sleeping bag; the cavalry officer messed his soldiers about; LCpl Paulson was \nstriking out at a superior who had made his life difficult and undermined his soldierly \nreputation. It appears therefore that those acts of misbehaviour carried a message of \ndisapproval and put pressure on the senior person to change their behaviour. They \ntherefore act as an unofficial means of communication and an unstated vector for \ncorrection. \n In other cases, rules are bent or broken in a way that appears to be inspired by \nan unofficial sense of \u2018justice\u2019 that transcends the formal rules. LCpl Paulson\u2019s \npunishment for what was, strictly speaking, an organizationally damaging act, was \nmanaged by his CO in such as way as to do him the least possible harm because there \n29 \nwas unofficially seen to be justice in the fate that he meted out to his objectionable \nsuperior. \n Rule bending or breaking can also, as we have seen, be advantageous to those \nconcerned by making their lives easier, without seriously compromising the \neffectiveness and reputation of those parts of the organization to which they belong, \nor perhaps even enhancing them. Many legitimate secondary adjustments seem to fall \ninto this category, as in the case of the hidden trade in buckshees which obviates the \nneed for tedious and expensive procedures in replacing lost equipment. In this \ncategory, an interesting parallel may be the forbidden use of the \u2018tap\u2019 by American \naircraft workers in the 1950s described by Bensman and Gerver (1963), where a \ndevice for illegally overcoming a misalignment of aircraft parts by tapping a new \nthreaded hole was in routine use. Its use was organizationally necessary to avoid \nlosing time on a task and was unofficially managed through the shop-floor \norganizational management system. Similarly, Malcolm Young has described the \nmanipulation of crime and detection statistics by a British police force in the 1960s \nand 1970s to make particular police organizations appear successful (Young, 1991). \nSuch acts are against the rules but permitted (or even encouraged) because without \nthem the organization might fail in its purposes. \nUseful as Figure One might be in tracing the lineaments of any one incident \nand providing a basis for comparison between incidents, therefore, its use would be \nincomplete without immersing the resulting analysis in the organizational cultural \nprocesses that surround each incident. We would need to consider such aspects as the \nsense of justice or injustice shared by the agents involved, where they differ in this \nrespect, and how. We would need to explore the social and emotional networks that \nsurround each case, and how they are acted out within the rank system. We would \n30 \nneed to see where the joints and divisions lie within and between the organizational \ngroups involved and we need to consider the concepts and feelings about being \n\u2018soldierly\u2019 and how all these impinge on the playing out of the incident. We need to \nlook for the messages that such acts imply, to search for the negotiations that they \nmight represent, and to be prepared to explore any organizational advantage that they \nmight unofficially bring. \nLet us look again at LCpl Paulson\u2019s attack on 2Lt Saxby. In the emotionally \nand socially bonded infantry company 2Lt Saxby was an outsider, parachuted in, as it \nwere, from another world (that of Sandhurst via his home military organization). He \nhad no feeling for the organizational culture of the battalion to which he was attached \nor that of the infantry company he found himself in. By his behaviour he isolated \nhimself from the network of friends and allies that should have been available to him \nthrough his fellow officers (all members of the same social institution, the Officers\u2019 \nMess) or the NCOs in his platoon, and particularly his platoon sergeant. His idea of \nsoldierly standards was at odds with those of his men (he put them through training \nthey considered unnecessary) and he personally and repeatedly demeaned LCpl \nPaulson by criticising his soldierly attributes as a signals detachment commander. \nThis activity put him in a position where he remained a remote outsider while \nphysically occupying a space in the organization. All this needs to be described before \none can competently use the ideas encapsulated in Figure One to understand why Cpl \nPaulson\u2019s disruptive secondary adjustment was treated superficially as illegitimate but \nsilently as \u2018OK\u2019. \n \nConclusion \n31 \nThis article has examined some particular cases of British soldiers\u2019 behaviour \nin the face of rules. It has shown that rules may be fixed but their observance or \notherwise is a social process that is under the control of the agents of authority whilst \nstill being open to a degree of negotiation. It has noted some of the key ideas arising \nin social science about \u2018misbehaviour\u2019 or \u2018resistance\u2019 or \u2018dissent\u2019.  Going beyond \ngeneric models of resistance etc. and Hockey\u2019s of negotiated order, via Goffman\u2019s of \nprimary and secondary adjustments, important variables have been identified in the \npractice of rule observance, rule bending, and rule breaking in the Army.  \nIdentification of those variables here has allowed the construction of a structured \ndiagram which provides a framework to help in the analysis of particular incidents. \nHowever, each time this framework is used it should be located in its particular rich \nethnographic milieu because without that it may produce little more than sociological \nlabels \u2013 convenient enough perhaps for structural analysis of events and for \ncomparison of one incident with another, but lacking the breath and warmth and \nrichness of real life as it is lived which must be the first concern of the successful \nethnographer. \nWe began with cases of informal revenge and ended with another, very much \nless subtle but still action taken against a formal superior by a junior. One of the \nquestions posed at the start of this paper was whether or not such acts of revenge are \nexotic one-offs that fall outside the cultural norms of the Army or whether they are in \nsome way consistent with the organizational culture. These questions can now be \nanswered. \nActs of rule breaking or bending can be placed on a continuum of secondary \nadjustments from mild legitimate ones such as the hiding of buckshees from the QM \n(Tech)\u2019s inspection through to serious (if rare) disruptive ones such as the striking of a \n32 \nsuperior officer, all of which need to be viewed through the lens of the organizational \nculture and the flow of events surrounding them. Far from being one-off counter-\ncultural events, acts of disobedience appear to be particular manifestations of a \nregular rule bending and rule breaking cultural pattern played out in daily practice. \nViewing them in this way, as particular examples of legitimate or illegitimate \nsecondary adjustments rather than simply as acts of \u2018resistance\u2019 or \u2018misbehaviour\u2019, \nlocates them in the robust and engaging organizational culture of the British Army, \nwhere they belong.  \nFinally, we might bear such considerations in mind when we see high profile \ncases of apparently illegitimate activity by soldiers reported in the media, cases such \nas \u2018bullying\u2019 or \u2018prisoner abuse\u2019 or \u2018initiation\u2019, for example. We may ask ourselves to \nwhat extent these are the actions of deviant people misusing the authority vested in \nthem and to what extent they are secondary adjustments arising in particular contexts, \npart of the flow of personal and collective histories, taking place with or without \nauthority agents\u2019 signals of \u2018OK-ness\u2019 or \u2018not-OK-ness\u2019, and in the context of \norganizational cultural norms. Such questions are the province of the ethnographer \nand without the involvement of ethnographers with the necessary legal investigators \nperhaps the true nature of these events will remain undiscovered and true justice \ndenied. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nI would like to thank the three reviewers, including Matthew Brannan who identified \nhimself, for their comments on a previous version of this article.  I would also like to \nthank Paul Willis for his encouragement at the start of the process. \n \n \n33 \n \nNotes \n                                                 \n1\n The Gun Number One is responsible for all equipment associated with an artillery piece and for the \noperational standards of himself and his men (his \u2018detachment\u2019). He also has further responsibilities for \nthe training and welfare of his gun detachment.  \n2\n The series of ranks in the British Army are at http:\/\/www.army.mod.uk\/hq_itg\/rank.htm, accessed 21 \nAugust 2007. In outline, there are three types of rank found in an operational unit, starting from the \nbottom: private solders and Non-Commissioned Officers (privates, lance-corporals, corporals, \nsergeants and staff sergeants, who exercise small scale command and authority over small teams); \nwarrant officers (WO 2 and WO 1) who have greater authority and typically form an important layer of \nmanagement at sub-unit level; commissioned officers (second lieutenants, lieutenants, captains, majors, \nand lieutenant colonels who hold the Queen\u2019s Commission). The subject is far too complex for a full \nexplanation in a footnote, but suffice it to say that the unit is commanded by a lieutenant colonel with a \nWO1 as their regimental sergeant major, sub-units are commanded by majors with a WO2 as their \nsergeant major, that young officers (lieutenants and second lieutenants) are expected still to be learning \ntheir profession at least until they reach Captain and so are assisted, and in some cases informally \nsupervised by, senior NCOs.  The system is not so much hierarchical as a horizontally and vertically \nlooped network within a hierarchical framework. \n3\n \u2018Soldier\u2019 in this paper refers to any uniformed member of a military unit, regardless of rank. To gauge \nthe status of the soldier(s) in question a further qualification is needed, either involving the citing of a \nrank or by a statement such as \u2018junior\u2019 or \u2018senior\u2019, or as here, a group to which they belong (the \nsquadron in question). \n4\n The Army Act 1955 has (largely) been replaced by the Armed Forces Act 2006, which introduces a \nTri-Service discipline structure.  However, the Army Act 1955 is the body of law which formed the \nlegal disciplinary background to the times and places in which this article is set. \n5\n NUD*IST 6 is fully described in Sage (1997).   Essentially, it allows the researcher to build a flexible \ndatabase from whole documents and text units, creating searchable nodes, categories and hierarchies of \ndata that can be developed, amended, and restructured as the research progresses. \n6\n In essence, the \u2018best practice\u2019 which was developing during the study and is currently encoded in the \nASA Ethical Code (ASA 2009) was followed. \n7\n \u2018Battery\u2019 is the name for a sub unit in an artillery regiment.  The type of unit in which this incident \ntook place comprised four batteries, each of approximately 100 soldiers. \n8\n \u2018Buckshee\u2019 is a universal British Army word for \u2018unrecorded or unregistered item\u2019, or in a related \nsense \u2018free\u2019 or \u2018unimportant\u2019. It appears to come from the Hindi word \u2018backsheesh\u2019. \n9\n Four-wheeled military vehicle. \n10\n This condition of service could also be used to get four rail warrants (i.e. to have four free railway \njourneys).  These, however, did not involve any exchange of cash and so profit could be made from \nthem. \n11\n There may an interesting parallel here with Gouldner\u2019s characterization of an \u2018indulgency pattern\u2019  \n(1954: 45-56) where supervisors and managers create conditions in which rules are not strictly \nenforced, with a resulting raising of the workers\u2019 quality of life at work.  This could be otherwise \ndescribed as a regime rich in legitimate secondary adjustments. \n12\n \u2018War-y\u2019 (various spellings) was an unofficial army term meaning that operational aspects were being \ntaken too seriously. \n13\n \u2018Regimental duty\u2019 is the term that refers to service in formed military unit as opposed to a \nheadquarters or in other staff posts. \n14\n All were male because at that time (and it is still the case) women are barred from joining the \nInfantry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n34 \n                                                                                                                                            \n \n \nReferences \n \nAckroyd, S. and Thompson, P.
