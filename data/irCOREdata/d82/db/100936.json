INTRODUCTION\nNon-Newtonian fluid behavior, which is characterized by\na nonlinear viscosity dependence on the strain, can be ob-\nserved in many complex fluids, for example, polymers, dense\ncolloidal dispersions, surfactant solutions, and micellar solu-\ntions. In addition to shear-thinning and shear-thickening be-\nhavior, a dynamic or even chaotic response can be found in\nsome fluids subjected to a steady shear flow. Phenomenologi-\ncally closely related is the stick-slip behavior associated with\nplastic flow occurring in dry friction processes.\nA nonlinear generalization of the time honored Maxwell\nfluid provides a generic model for the treatment of both\nshear-thinning and shear-thickening behavior \u00031\u0004. Recently, it\nhas been demonstrated that the nonlinear Maxwell model\nalso yields periodic and chaotic solutions for specific ranges\nof the relevant model parameters \u00032\u0004. The flow curve, i.e., the\ndependence of the viscosity or of the shear stress on the\nshear rate can be invoked to correlate the model with a\nphysical system. An example to be specified below is a\nshear-thickening micellar solution \u00033,4\u0004\nIn recent years there has been an increase of interest in the\nbehavior of complex fluids under flow. This is shown by the\namount of research being undertaken by people in the com-\nmunity. Cates and co-workers \u00035\u20137\u0004 study simple constitutive\nequations for shear-thickening materials and show instabili-\nties and chaos under shear flow. Das et al. \u00038\u0004 focus on routes\nto spatiotemporal chaos in sheared nematogenic fluids, an\narea also investigated by Fielding and Olmsted \u00039\u0004 using\nsimple models. Dasan et al. \u000310\u0004 use the tools of nonlinear\ndynamics to study stress fluctuations in sheared Stokesian\nsuspensions.\nMost of this work was inspired by the study of models for\nthe dynamics of liquid crystals based on the alignment tensor\ntheory \u000311\u201313\u0004 \u0001which, in limiting cases, reduces to the\nLeslie-Ericksen theory\u0002 and Doi-Hess kinetic theory of nem-\natic polymers \u000314\u201316\u0004. The orientation of the director and\ndegree of alignment allowed for calculations of rheological\nproperties, which is the step taken by Rien\u00e4cker et al.\n\u000317\u201319\u0004 to eventually show chaotic rheological behaviors. A\nclose similarity in the behavior of the stress and the align-\nment tensor is found in many fluids and referred to as the\nstress-optical law \u000320\u0004, which motivates our choice of\nequations.\nAlthough it is known that such systems are able to dem-\nonstrate a variety of dynamical regimes, including chaos, the\ninstabilities and typical transitions between such regimes are\nweakly studied. In this paper we systematically study dy-\nnamical mechanisms for the evolution of different regimes\nand reveal typical instabilities leading to the onset of chaos.\nMore specifically, a solution phase diagram based on the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent is presented which indicates the\nkind of solutions which can occur in distinct ranges of the\nmodel parameters. The transition from periodic to chaotic\nsolutions is investigated. Period doubling and also undou-\nbling scenarios are found for certain parameter ranges. In\nother regimes, Shilnikov type limit cycle solutions and an\nintermittency route to chaos are found. These findings are\ncompared to parametric bifurcation diagrams which allow\nfor a better classification of the bifurcation types and reveal\nin more detail the dynamics behind the equations.\nThe present analysis is restricted to the study of a simple\nshear flow, i.e., a plane Couette geometry with an imposed\nspatially constant shear rate, yet the dynamics is already\nrather complex. We consider such an analysis as compulsory\nbefore the full hydrodynamics with spatially inhomogeneous\nshear rates as encountered in particular experiments is inves-\ntigated. At least on a small length scale, the relation between\nthe local stress tensor and a local shear rate as studied here\nalso exists for more complex flows, and knowing the local\nfeatures can be crucial to understanding the global behavior.\n*c.goddard@surrey.ac.uk\n\u2020\no.hess@surrey.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 77, 026311 \u00012008\u0002\n1539-3755\/2008\/77\u00012\u0002\/026311\u00017\u0002 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society026311-1\nII.

Due to the scaling chosen, the relaxation time is\ncharacterized by the single parameter A\u0001. For A\u0001\u00011, the\nnonlinear terms are less important and the ordinary Maxwell\nmodel behavior is approached. With \u000b\u00020, this corresponds\nto the Johnson-Segalman model \u000321,22\u0004. The yield stress at\nA\u0001=1 is denoted by \u0007c. Furthermore, \u000b\u02dc=\u000b \/\u00053.\nIn the following investigations we have chosen to fix the\nvalues of \u0007c=1 and \u000b\u02dc=0 for simplicity. Based on the analy-\nsis of the related liquid crystal problem \u000319\u0004 for the plane\nCouette flow we expect that \u000b\u00020 will give rise to quantita-\ntive changes but will not affect in a qualitative way the oc-\ncurrence of the different types of the dynamical behavior.\nThe model is formulated such that \u00070, \u00071, and \u00072 describe\nthe main dynamics of the system in time through the shear\nstress and the first and second normal stress differences,\nwhile \u00073 and \u00074 provide symmetry breaking components for\nthe plane Couette flow.\nThe dimensionless shear stress is expressed as\n\u0004 = H\u0010 = \u0007c\u00072 + H\u0003\u0010 , \u00016\u0002\nwhere \u0007c and H\u0003 are two model parameters set as constant in\nthis investigation. H\u0003 is linked to the second Newtonian vis-\ncosity reached at high shear rates. The dimensionless first\nand second normal stress differences can also be computed\nfrom\nN1 =\n\u0004xx \u2212 \u0004yy\nG\n= 2\u0007c\u00071,\nN2 =\n\u0004yy \u2212 \u0004zz\nG\n= \u2212 \u0007c\u0001\u00071 + \u00053\u00070\u0002 . \u00017\u0002\nThe two control parameters chosen for investigation are \u0010,\nwhich is a dimensionless shear rate for the plane Couette\nflow \u0001\u0010=\u0001vx \/\u0001y\u0002, and A\u0001, which controls the strength of the\nlinear terms in the potential function and depends strongly on\nthe temperature of the system or the number density of the\ndispersion \u00032\u0004.\nFor realistic physical systems, the range of values avail-\nable for investigation are \u0010=0\u21925 and here we focus on\nA\u0001=0\u21920.5. As shown below, in these ranges of the param-\neters the system demonstrates a variety of interesting nonlin-\near phenomena including chaotic behavior.\nFor comparison with physical systems we notice that a\nshear-induced transition with an upward jump of the shear\nGODDARD et al.

The\nexperimental flow curve presented in Ref. \u00034\u0004 is matched by\nour model curve for A\u0001\u00061.2 \u0001with \u000b=0 and \u0007c=1\u0002. The\nreference values for the shear stress and the shear rate are\n\u000610 Pa and 100 s\u22121. It should be possible to reach the in-\nteresting regime of A\u0001\u00110.5 by lowering the temperature or\nby increasing the density. On the other hand, the plastic flow\nas encountered in solid friction shows many dynamic fea-\ntures \u000336\u201338\u0004 which are found for the present model in the\nrange of A\u0001 investigated here.\nIII. DYNAMICAL REGIMES\nFirst, we identify the regimes of chaotic dynamics of the\nsystem \u00014\u0002 by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent in\ndependence of control parameters \u0010 and A\u0001. If the largest\nexponent is zero or less, this signifies a regular oscillation in\nthe system; a positive exponent however indicates a chaotic\nbehavior.\nThe largest Lyapunov exponents calculated for different\nsolutions are displayed in Fig. 1 through an intensity plot.\nThe initial starting values for the components \u00070 , . . . ,\u00074 are\nchosen to be small but nonzero, namely \u00120.01.\nThe figure shows two distinct \u201cchaotic islands\u201d which are\nseparated by areas of regular dynamics. Generally, the pa-\nrameter plane \u0010-A\u0001 can be divided into four characteristic\nregions denoted in Fig. 2 by different colors, where the sys-\ntem demonstrates, from an experimental point of view, dif-\nferent dynamical regimes.\nHere, region S corresponds to steady state solutions, P is\nan area where the attractor of the system is a single stable\nperiodic orbit, and M is a region of multistabilty, where sev-\neral attractors, one of which might be a chaotic one, can\ncoexist for the same parameters\u2019 values. The region C con-\ntains the largest chaotic island shown in Fig. 1. This is an\narea where chaos is most likely to appear.\nThe steady state solutions from the model correspond ex-\nperimentally to smooth equilibrium flows. The stresses set up\nin the fluid become constant \u0001after some initial transient pe-\nriod\u0002 and represent normal laminar Couette flow responses\nfor the imposed external flow field.\nPeriodic solutions in experiments can be brought about by\nmany different causes. In the case of liquid crystals a tum-\nbling or wagging motion of the director will produce such a\nresponse in the rheological properties \u000323\u0004. For a lyotropic\nlamellar phase, the sample can oscillate between two distinct\nmicrostructural states \u000324\u0004; for Micelles, temporal oscilla-\ntions can be observed due to coupling between the micro-\nstructure and flow field \u000325\u0004.\nChaotic fluctuations of the shear stress are also observed\nexperimentally, and caused by many of the same reasons as\nperiodic flow, except that the mechanism at work results in\nirregular chaotic oscillations. For example, with a lyotropic\nlamellar phase, simple rheological chaos is observed when\nthere is a competition between ordered and disordered states,\ndriven by the stress \u000326\u0004. Surfactant solutions show chaotic\ndynamics due to stick-slip between shear induced structures\nand the coexisting dilute phases \u000327\u0004.\nViscoelasticity is also a key property of this model and is\na cause for the nonlinear behavior seen in the flow solutions\nfrom our simulations due to the stress history dependence.\nExperimentally, viscoelastic polymer solutions have been\nseen to display chaotic effects at low Reynolds numbers due\nto elastic turbulence, driven by elastic stresses causing insta-\nbilities \u000328\u0004.\nIV. BIFURCATION ANALYSIS\nIn order to reveal instabilities that induce transitions be-\ntween the regions in Fig. 2 and that lead to the appearance of\nchaotic behavior we undertook a bifurcation analysis of the\nmodel \u00014\u0002. The results of this analysis for the most important\nregimes are summarized in Fig. 3, where different bifurca-\ntion lines are indicated by different colors. The bifurcation\ndiagram was revealed using numerical branch continuation\nmethods \u000329\u0004 and stability analysis.\nA comparison of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 shows that the bound-\nary of the regions in Fig. 2 are in good agreement with cer-\ntain bifurcation lines in Fig. 3.

For a discussion of the entropy production, see \u00032\u0004.\nThe following abbreviations are used in Fig. 4: HB\u2014\nAndronov-Hopf bifurcation; PD\u2014period-doubling bifurca-\ntion; SN\u2014saddle-node \u0001fold\u0002 bifurcation for periodic orbits;\nBP\u2014branch point.\nOne can distinguish three main families of periodic orbits\nwhich are involved in dynamics of the model \u00014\u0002 and give\nrise to all stable oscillatory solutions. In the figure the\nbranches of the above orbits are indicated by numbers 1\u20133.\nAs the value of \u0010 decreases, the family of cycles 1 appears\nthrough Hopf bifurcation \u0001HB1\u0002. The initial limit cycle of\nthis family loses its stability after it has undergone a period-\ndoubling bifurcation at the point PD1 \u0001\u0010\u00063.3\u0002, which leads\nto the appearance of a stable period-doubled cycle. Further\ndecrease of \u0010 produces a cascade of period-doubling bifur-\ncations, which eventually leads to the birth of chaos. Note, to\nprevent overloading of the diagram only the main cycles of\neach family are shown in the figure. At \u0010\u00062.15, the main\ncycle of the family 1 again becomes stable as the result of an\ninverse period-doubling bifurcation \u0001point PD2\u0002. At \u0010\u00062\n\u0001BP1\u0002 it merges with a cycle of family 3. As \u0010 decreases, the\nfamily 2 appears via saddle-node bifurcation for periodic or-\nbits \u0001SN\u0002. This bifurcation gives birth to a pair of cycles, one\nof which is stable \u0001belongs to family 2\u0002, and one which is\nunstable \u0001period-doubled cycle of the branch of family 3\u0002.\nRemarkably, the stable limit does not change its stability\nwith further decreasing down to \u0010=0, and, in fact, its exis-\ntence determines the region P in Fig. 2 for small values of \u0010.\nThe initial cycle of family 3 is born unstable from an un-\nstable fixed point at \u0010\u00062.8 via Andronov-Hopf bifurcation\n\u0001HB2\u0002.

For instance, on the\ninterval \u0010\u0001 \u00011.82,2.04\u0002 multistability manifests itself in the\ncoexistence of stable limit cycles belonging to the families 2\nand 3, whereas on \u0010\u0001 \u00032.04,2.14\u0002 it results from coexistence\nof the attractors of the families 1 and 2.\nThe \u00073 and \u00074 components change the type of solution\ndepending on whether they are zero or nonzero. Nonzero\ncomponents produce \u201ckayaking\u201d responses \u000318\u0004. For the\nmain cycles involved in the bifurcation diagram, only branch\n3 has zero \u00073 and \u00074, while the main cycles of branches 1\nand 2 have nonzero \u00073 and \u00074.\nA different bifurcation scenario is realized for larger A\u0001,\nwhen \u0010 changes along the route II in Fig. 3. In Figs.\n4\u0001b\u0002\u20134\u0001d\u0002 typical bifurcation transitions of the main cycles of\nfamilies 1\u20133 are illustrated for A\u0001=0.45. One can see that as\nbefore family 1 joins family 3 at a branching point BP1 \u0003Fig.\n4\u0001c\u0002\u0004. However, in contrast to route I, family 1 does not\ninvolve anymore Andronov-Hopf bifurcations of a fixed\npoint \u0003see point HB1 in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002\u0004. Instead, the stability of the\nfixed point changes via saddle-node bifurcation SNp \u0003see Fig.\n4\u0001d\u0002\u0004. The evolution of the limit cycles of family 2 also\nchanges. If along route I it loses stability as the result of\nsaddle-node bifurcation merging with the unstable period-\ndouble cycle of family 3, now it exists for larger values of \u0010\nuntil it collides with an unstable fixed point \u0003Fig. 4\u0001d\u0002\u0004. This\ncollision is illustrated in Fig. 5, where the involved limit\ncycle and fixed point are shown for three values of the pa-\nrameter \u0010. As \u0010 decreases, the limit cycle changes its shape\nand approaches an unstable point to collide with the latter at\n\u0010\u00063.02.\nNote, comparing with route I, the evolution of family 2\nbecomes more complex. As it is seen from Fig. 4\u0001d\u0002, with an\nincrease of \u0010, the main cycle of family 2 undergoes a num-\nber of bifurcations altering its stability and producing a few\nnew branches of solutions. Hence, increasing \u0010 for large\nvalues of A\u0001 can lead to complex dynamical behavior of the\nsystem, including chaos.\nV. MECHANISMS OF CHAOS\nNext we consider in more detail the scenario of develop-\ning chaos. To do this we use one-parametrical bifurcation\nanalysis to scan the solutions of the system \u00014\u0002 across region\nC in Fig. 2.\nIn Fig. 6 a one parametrical bifurcation diagram is pre-\nsented which illustrates a Poincar\u00e9 section \u00072 of stable solu-\ntion changes with varying \u0010 and fixed A\u0001=0.25. As the pa-\nrameter \u0010 is increased up to \u0010=3.4446, the system\ndemonstrates a period-doubling transition to chaos. How-\never, further increase of \u0010 produces inverse sequences of\nbifurcations, where the period of a stable limit cycle is\nhalved with each bifurcation. We found the period-doubling\nscenario for the onset of chaos quite general for the system\n\u00014\u0002. This type of chaos can be achieved for all main branches\nof solutions 1\u20133; however, typically it is realized for a very\ntiny range of parameters, which would be difficult to achieve\nin real experiments due to instrumental limitations.\nAnother type of chaos, which is different from the period-\ndoubling one, is illustrated in Fig. 7, where the time realiza-\ntion and a projection of the phase portrait are plotted for\n0.10\n0.14\n0.18\n0.22\n0.26\n0.30\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n0.05\n0.15\n0.25\n0.35\n0.45\n0.10\n0.14\n0.18\n0.22\n0.26\n0.30\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n0.05\n0.15\n0.25\n0.35\n0.45\n0.10\n0.14\n0.18\n0.22\n0.26\n0.30\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n0.05\n0.15\n0.25\n0.35\n0.45\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\u03c02\n\u03c02\n\u03c00\n\u03c00\n\u03c01\n\u03c01\n\u03c00\n\u03c02\n\u03c01\nFIG. 5.

Here we see the system exhibiting inter-\nesting relaxation oscillations, where the stress slowly builds\nup and then reaches a point where, in this example, chaotic\noscillations begin. Then at seemingly random points the so-\nlution essentially \u201cdrops\u201d out of this normal nonlinear orbit\n\u0001at t=190, 280, 460, . . .\u0002, before slowly returning once\nagain.\nIt is possible through further selection of model param-\neters to have the system stabilize to a limit cycle. The time\nseries shown in Fig. 8\u0001a\u0002 and its phase portrait projection,\nFig. 8\u0001b\u0002, use model parameters of A\u0001=0.23 and \u0010=3.75 to\nachieve this. The transient period has been removed from\nboth of the plots. This has a striking resemblance to that of\nShilnikov cycles \u000330\u0004, where homoclinic orbits combine to a\nsaddle focus.\nThe phase portrait projection shows an orbit spiral toward\na fixed point saddle focus, but whereas one would normally\nexpect the solution to stay at the node, as in a critically\ndamped system, this solution is repelled away when it\nreaches the center. The repelled trajectory then proceeds to\ncomplete a number of oscillations before the solution repeats\nitself in the limit cycle. If one were to use the second normal\nstress difference \u0001N2\u0002 as a third axis on the plot then the\nspiral would fall on a plane, and the ejected solution would\nbe perpendicular. Shilnikov has proved theorems concerning\nstability and existence of such homoclinic periodic orbits\n\u000330,31\u0004.\nSimilar Shilnikov orbits have been observed experimen-\ntally in systems such as optothermal nonlinear devices \u000332\u0004,\nliquid crystal flow \u000333\u0004, and even reverse spiral cycles in\nlasers with saturable absorbers \u000334\u0004.\nThe appearance of the stable solutions can also vary with\nthe control parameter. A change is observed in the number of\noscillations before returning to the spiral and also, in some\ncases, the number of spirals. As an example, several solu-\ntions where this change has been observed are shown in Fig.\n9. These solutions are all calculated using the same value of\nA\u0001=0.23, but different values of \u0010. Figures 9\u0001a\u0002\u20139\u0001c\u0002 show\nan increase in the number of off spiral oscillations. Figure\n9\u0001d\u0002 shows a limit cycle with two spiral structures; this is a\ndouble-pulse homoclinic orbit version of Fig. 9\u0001a\u0002.\nWe note that in comparison with the period-doubling\nchaos discussed above, this type of chaos has a much larger\narea in the parameter space \u0010-A\u0001 and therefore it could be\nmore easily observed in experiments. One would expect to\nsee this type of behavior manifested as a type of bursting\nprocess in the stress during flow. Our results from the chaotic\ntime series in Fig. 7 are similar to those seen in the chaotic\nflow of wormlike micelles \u000335\u0004.\nVI.

We have mapped the largest Lyapunov\nexponent of the solutions arising from varying the two main\nsystem parameters in order to identify the different dynami-\ncal regimes. Using this we were able to locate and observe\nclear bifurcation structures leading to chaotic solutions. We\nhave also shown homoclinic Shilnikov saddle-focus orbits\nand revealed Shilnikov bifurcation. Through the use of sta-\nbility analysis we were able to classify some of the main\nmethods of stability loss that give rise to the chaotic solu-\ntions which are observed. Parametric bifurcation diagrams\nreveal the underlying structure of the equations, the bound-\naries of which match the Lyapunov exponent map very well.\nThe mechanism causing smooth flow to become unstable is\nidentified as Hopf bifurcation. We remark that the solution in\nFig. 7 is similar to the stick-slip behavior seen in solid fric-\ntion \u000336\u201339\u0004.\nFor spatially resolved flow, the full hydrodynamic prob-\nlem must be considered, with the full model \u0003Eq. \u00012\u0002\u0004 includ-\ning the Laplace-term and appropriate boundary conditions as\nsuggested in \u000340\u0004. Initial simulations are also seen to display\nchaotic responses analogous to inertial turbulence, but for\nvery low Reynolds numbers \u0001Re\u00111\u0002. Such behavior could\nbe utilized for potential mixing applications with complex\nfluids such as polymers, whereby the \u201cself mixing\u201d proper-\nties combine with the excellent phase space exploration that\na chaotic system possesses.\nApplication to a cylindrical Couette flow where we expect\nto find shear banding in certain parameter regimes is possible\nand desirable. This then opens a wider possibility to compare\nwith experiments \u000341,42\u0004 and with other theoretical models\n\u000343,44\u0004.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nC.G. and A.B. acknowledge the support of EPSRC U.K.\n\u00031\u0004 O.
