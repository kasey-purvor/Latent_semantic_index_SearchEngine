Examples are the crystallisation of a-Si on low thermal \nbudget glass substrates for TFT\u2019s in liquid crystal display applications [1, 2], \nsolar cells and IC\u2019s on flexible substrates [3].  Some work has been reported \non excimer laser annealing of ferroelectric thin films, both cystallisation \nfrom an amorphous state [4] and a two step crystallisation process involving \ncombined furnace\/laser annealing [5, 6] whereby a low temperature perovskite \nP P DONOHUE et al \nphase is initiated by a relatively low temperature and long duration furnace \nanneal and then refined by laser annealing.  This paper details a novel \ndevelopment of excimer laser annealing where the films are annealed from \nthe amorphous state using pulses which have been temporally extended [7, 8].  \nThe extension of the pulse duration (fwhm), from 25ns to 374ns, alleviates \ntwo of the main problems of excimer laser annealing of ferroelectric thin \nfilms, namely high surface temperatures and poor heat distribution, by \nincreasing the diffusion length of the heat generated during the pulse, while \nstill retaining the benefit of not significantly heating the underlying \nsubstrate.    \n \nEXPERIMENT \n \nThin film PZT 30\/70 with a 10% Pb excess was deposited using the sol-gel \ntechnique [9, 10] onto platinised silicon substrates giving the structure \nPZT(~500nm)\/Pt(1000\u2211)\/Ti(100\u2211)\/SiO2(0.8\u03bcm)\/Si. Each PZT layer was \nfired at 400\u00b0C to remove organic components.  The optical properties of the \nas-deposited PZT, used for modelling purposes, were measured using \nreflectometry and spectroscopic ellipsometry.  Laser annealing was \naccomplished using a bespoke system, described in detail elsewhere [7, 8], \ncomprising a Lambda Physik LPX210 KrF excimer laser (248nm), pulse-\nextension optics (25ns pulse width to 374ns pulse width), a Microlas beam \nhomogeniser (8mm\u00d78mm uniform beam to \u00b15%) and a vacuum compatible \nannealing chamber with heated substrate holder.  Temporal pulse shapes \nwere measured using an ITL vacuum photodiode coupled to a Gould 4094 \nDSO.   \nThe PZT thin films were assessed using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and \ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques.  Detailed \ncrystallographic phase investigations were made using small area electron \ndiffraction (SAED) in a Philips CM20 TEM. \n \nTEMPERATURE PROFILE MODELLING \n \nThe temperature profiles developed in the thin film layer stacks due to laser \nirradiation  have been predicted by solution of the heat diffusion equation \nwith the addition of a source term for laser induced heating.  When a beam \nhomogeniser is used then away from the edge of the illuminated region the \nheat diffusion problem can be reduced to the unidimensional case since any \ntemperature variation will occur only along an axis perpendicular to the \nsample surface.  Additionally the annealing conditions and materials \nproperties are such that heat flow by radiation, convection and conduction \ninto the surrounding atmosphere can be neglected.  The temperature T at \ndistance z from the illuminated surface and time t is then given by \n \nLASER CRYSTALLISATION OF FERROELECTRIC \n( ) 1,\np p\nT TI z t\nt c c z z\n\u03b1 \u03ba\u03c1 \u03c1\n\u2202 \u2202 \u2202\u239b \u239e= + \u239c \u239f\u2202 \u2202 \u2202\u239d \u23a0\n (1) \n \nwhere I is the laser power density, \u03b1 is the optical absorption coefficient, \u03c1 is \nthe density, cp is the specific heat capacity and \u03ba is the thermal conductivity.   \nThe optical constants of the PZT thin films were determined experimentally \nand thermal properties for each layer were those determined for bulk \nmaterials [11, 12, 13], the layers considered being sufficiently thick for this to be \na valid assumption [8].  Due to the complex nature of the samples equation \n(1) is not solvable analytically.  A forward time finite difference approach, \ndescribed in detail elsewhere [7, 8, 14], has been used to solve for the \ntemperature distribution.  The approach adopted involved the layer structure \nbe discritised into finite slices of thickness 50nm, temperatures output being \nthe average for each slice, and time discritised into 25ps units.  This \nnumerical approach allowed temperature variation of the layer thermal \nproperties to be taken into account and also measured pulse temporal profiles \nto be used. \n \nRESULTS \n \n500nm Thick PZT Films \n \nModelled temperature profiles in the PZT layer stack are shown for the case \nof a non-extended pulse (fwhm ~ 25ns) in Figures 1 and 2.  Figure 1 \nillustrates the temperatures developed in the PZT slices during and after a \npulse of fluence 100mJ\/cm2, assuming an ambient temperature of 300\u00b0C.  \nThe curve labelled PZT surface is the slice adjacent to the film surface while \nthat labelled PZT\/Pt interface is the slice adjacent to the Pt.  Figure 2 shows \na cross section through the layer stack (the thin Ti adhesion layer has been \nomitted) at several times after the onset of the pulse.  It can be seen from the \nfigures that the non-extended pulse induces very high surface temperatures \nand large temperature gradients in the PZT \u2013 primarily due to the very short \nabsorption length (~20nm at 248nm) and low thermal diffusivity (~5\u00d710-\n7m2\/s) of this layer.  The surface temperature of the PZT reaches a maximum \nof 1758\u00b0C, with the PZT adjacent to the Pt reaching 444\u00b0C.  Interestingly the \nuppermost portion of the Si substrate reaches a maximum of only 324\u00b0C, \nonly 24\u00b0C above ambient, partly due to the thermal barrier action of the \nSiO2. \n \nP P DONOHUE et al \n300\n500\n700\n900\n1100\n1300\n1500\n1700\n1900\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6\nTime after onset of pulse (\u03bcs)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u00b0\nC\n)\nPZT surface\nPZT\/Pt interface\nIncreasing depth\n300\n500\n700\n900\n1100\n1300\n1500\n1700\n1900\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\nDistance from irradiated surface (\u03bcm)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u00b0\nC\n)\n0.028\n0.360\n1.370\n6.000\nTime after\nonset of\npulse\n(\u03bcs)\nPZ\nT\nPt Si\nO\n2\nSi\nFigure 1: Modelled temperature \ndistribution in a 500nm thick \nPZT thin film due to non- \nextended laser pulse of fluence \n100mJ\/cm2 \nFigure 2: Modelled temperature \ndistribution in layer stack with \n500nm thick PZT thin film and \nnon- extended laser pulse of \nfluence 100mJ\/cm2 \n \nFigures 3 and 4 show the same plots for an extended pulse of the \nsame fluence, 100mJ\/cm2.

Detailed \nmicrostructural analysis has been presented previously [7, 8], but the films \nhave, for fluence levels of ~100mJ\/cm2 and less, crystallised to perovskite \nwith no surface damage.  The PZT crystal structure, from the top surface \ndown, determined by SAED was perovskite\/pyrochlore\/amorphous with no \nperovskite nucleation or growth at the PZT\/Pt interface.  Table 1 below gives \nthe thickness of the perovskite, pyrochlore and amorphous regions in the \nPZT for various fluence levels and pulse counts.  The thickest perovskite \nlayer was 280nm, over half the original film thickness, and was formed by \n104 pulses at a fluence of 100mJ\/cm2.  \n \nAnneal conditions \nNumber\nof \nPulses \nFluence \n(mJ\/cm2) \nPerovskite \nRegion \nThickness \n(nm) \nPyrochlore \nRegion \nThickness \n(nm) \nAmorphous \nRegion \nThickness \n(nm) \n104 80 157 107 221 \n16\u00d7104 80 154 100 231 \n104+104 80+100 242 99 144 \n104 100 280 81 114 \n \nTable 1:  Crystallisation thicknesses in pulse-extended laser annealed PZT \nthin films. \n \nAn interesting surface-damage effect was observed when the fluence level \nwas increased above 100mJ\/cm2.  Figures 5, 6 and 7 show SEM pictures of \nsample surfaces at fluence levels of 80mJ\/cm2 (104 pulses), 117mJ\/cm2 (102 \npulses) and 200mJ\/cm2 (103 pulses) respectively.  At 80mJ\/cm2 the surface is \nsmooth while at 117mJ\/cm2 small pits are starting to appear.  Increasing the \nfluence to 200mJ\/cm2 resulted in dramatic surface disruption and what \nappears to be a melt pattern.  It may be noted that the 117mJ\/cm2 and \n200mJ\/cm2 annealed films had the same composition as the as-deposited \nfilms and both showed some degree of perovskite crystallisation.  Figure 8 \nshows the modelled maximum temperatures attained at various depths in the \nPZT at the three fluence levels.  Also indicated is the melting temperature of \nPbO, 886\u00b0C, the component in the original film with the lowest melting \npoint.  The modelled temperature distributions do not take into account \nphase changes, such as melting, and should only be considered as a rough \nguide only.  For a fluence of 80mJ\/cm2 the whole PZT film is well below the \nPbO melting temperature.  At 117mJ\/cm2 however the very top of the film \nhas reached the PbO melting temperature, corresponding to small scale \npitting in the SEM picture, while at 200mJ\/cm2 this has increased to around \nhalf the PZT thickness, corresponding to gross disruption in the annealed \nfilm.   \n \nP P DONOHUE et al \n  \nFigure 5: Surface of PZT thin \nfilm annealed with extended \npulses of fluence 80mJ\/cm2. \nFigure 6: Surface of PZT thin \nfilm annealed with extended \npulses of fluence 117mJ\/cm2. \n \n \n \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nDistance from PZT surface (nm)\nM\nax\nim\num\n T\nem\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u00b0\nC\n))\nPbO melting\ntemperature\nUpper curve 200mJ\/cm2\nMiddle curve 117mJ\/cm2\nLower curve 80mJ\/cm2\n \nFigure 7:  Surface of PZT thin \nfilm annealed with extended \npulses of fluence 200mJ\/cm2. \nFigure 8:  Maximum slice \ntemperature versus extended \npulse fluence. \n \n \n200nm and 300nm Thick PZT Films \n \nSince the pulse-extension technique is limited in the thickness of perovskite \nPZT that can be crystallised, due to fluence limitations identified in the \nprevious section, thinner layers were modelled to determine the temperature \ndistributions.  Figures 9 and 10 show the temperature distribution in a 300nm \nthick PZT film and in the whole layer stack respectively for an extended \npulse of fluence 100mJ\/cm2 and an ambient temperature of 300\u00b0C.  The \ntemperature distribution in the PZT is seen to be better than for the 500nm \nthick film with the maximum surface and PZT\/Pt interface temperatures \nbeing 712\u00b0C and 468\u00b0C respectively, a difference of 244\u00b0C, while the \ntopmost part of the Si only reaches a maximum of 327\u00b0C.  For a 200nm thick \nPZT film, Figures 11 and 12, the situation improves further with maximum \nsurface and PZT\/Pt interface temperatures being 643\u00b0C and 483\u00b0C \nrespectively, a difference of only 160\u00b0C, while the topmost Si only reached a \ntemperature of 328\u00b0C.  Compared with the 500nm thick PZT films pulse-\nextended annealing of these thinner films will benefit from lower surface \ntemperatures and a much improved heat distribution within the PZT film, \nLASER CRYSTALLISATION OF FERROELECTRIC \nwithout any apparent penalty in laser induced substrate heating.  The portion \nof the PZT film close to the Pt is also getting sufficiently hot for perovskite \ncrystallisation [15].  \nSince the PZT surface temperatures for the thinner films are distinctly lower \nthan the PbO melting temperature, 253\u00b0C lower for the 200nm thick film, \nthere is scope for increasing the fluence and bringing the entire PZT film up \nto the temperature levels used in the Rapid Thermal Processor (RTP) \nannealing route without taking the substrate above detrimental temperatures \n- ~450-500\u00b0C for standard Al based CMOS circuitry. \n \n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n700\n750\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\nTime after onset of pulse (\u03bcs)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u00b0\nC\n)\nPZT surface \nPZT\/Pt interface\nIncreasing depth\n \n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n700\n750\n800\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2\nDistance from irradiated surface (\u03bcm)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u00b0\nC\n)\n0.347\n0.435\n1.270\n6.000\nPZ\nT\nPt Si\nO\n2\nSi\nTime after\nonset of\npulse\n(\u03bcs)\n \nFigure 9:  Modelled \ntemperature distribution in a \n300nm thick PZT thin film due \nto an extended laser pulse of \nfluence 100mJ\/cm2 \nFigure 10: Modelled \ntemperature distribution in layer \nstack with 300nm thick PZT \nthin film and extended laser \npulse of fluence 100mJ\/cm2 \n \n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n700\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\nTime after onset of pulse (\u03bcs)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u00b0\nC\n)\nPZT surface\nPZT\/Pt interface\nIncreasing depth\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n700\n750\n800\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2\nDistance from irradiated surface (\u03bcm)\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n (\u00b0\nC\n)\n0.348\n0.493\n1.520\n6.000\nPZ\nT\nPt Si\nO\n2\nSi\nTime after\nonset of\npulse\n(\u03bcs)\n \nFigure 11:  Modelled \ntemperature distribution in a \n200nm thick PZT thin film due \nto an extended laser pulse of \nfluence 100mJ\/cm2 \nFigure 12: Modelled \ntemperature distribution in layer \nstack with 200nm thick PZT \nthin film and extended laser \npulse of fluence 100mJ\/cm2 \n \nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n \nP P DONOHUE et al \nLow temperature deposited PZT thin films can be crystallised into the \nperovskite phase using pulse-extended excimer laser annealing.  \nAdditionally the temperature rise is largely confined to the ferroelectric layer \nmaking the technique suitable for applications which involve low thermal \nbudget substrates, such as FeRAM devices \u2013 especially involving SBT films \nwhich require very high temperature processing.  Compared to annealing \nwith a standard pulse the action of the pulse extender slows down the rate of \nenergy delivery to the PZT, giving lower surface temperatures and improved \nheat distribution.  Use of this technique has been shown to be able to \ncrystallise up to 280nm of an amorphous PZT film to perovskite, which is of \nthe order of the thickness required for ferroelectric based non-volatile \nmemory.  The thickness of film that can be crystallised is however limited \ndue to fluence restrictions believed to be due to melting of the PbO \ncomponent in the as-deposited PZT.  Modelling studies have however \nindicated that for thinner films, of the order of 200-300nm in thickness, the \ntechnique should be capable of raising the entire PZT thin films to \ntemperatures used in conventional annealing treatments, e.g. RTP, without \ndetrimentally heating a low thermal budget substrate such as CMOS \ncircuitry.   \n  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThis work was funded by the UK Ministry of Defence.
