While the composition and the amount of material erupted 25 \nalong volcanic arcs are relatively well known, the chemical and isotopic composition 26 \nof the subducted material (altered oceanic crust and sediments) is poorly constrained 27 \nand is an important factor in the mass balance calculation. ODP Leg 185 in the  28 \nWestern Pacific used systematic sampling of the altered basaltic basement and 29 \nsediment pile and the creation of composite mixtures to quantify the total chemical 30 \nflux subducted at the Izu-Mariana margin.  Here, we report Hf and Nd isotopic 31 \ncompositions of materials recovered from this Leg. The Hf and Nd isotopic 32 \ncompositions of altered basalts from Hole 801C are indistinguishable from those of 33 \nrecent unaltered Pacific MORB suggesting that hydrothermal alteration had no effect 34 \non either isotopic systems.  35 \nThe complete Site 1149 sedimentary pile has a weighted average \u0001Nd of \u20135.9 and \u0001Hf 36 \nof +4.4, values similar to those of Fe-Mn crusts and nodules.  Therefore, the Hf and 37 \nNd isotopic compositions of the sediments collected at Site 1149 indicate minimal 38 \ncontributions from continental detrital material to the REE and HFSE.  However, the 39 \nHf isotopic budget of the oldest sediments is more influenced by continental material 40 \nthan the younger sediments, despite the large distances to continental masses 130 Ma 41 \nago.  42 \nIn the Izu subduction zone, we calculate a sedimentary input of less than about 2% in 43 \nthe volcanic lava source. In contrast, at least 85% of the sedimentary Nd and Hf are 44 \nrecycled into the mantle to affect its general composition. Assuming that sediments 45 \nhave been recycled in a similar manner into the mantle for millions of years, large 46 \nchemical heterogeneities must be produced in the mantle.  In addition, the depletion 47 \n 3 \nof the mantle due to the extraction of continental crust must be partly counterbalanced 48 \nby the injection of vast quantities of enriched sedimentary material.  49 \n50 \n 4 \nIntroduction 50 \nSubduction zones are the principal sites for exchange between the mantle and surficial 51 \ngeochemical reservoirs: the crust, ocean and atmosphere. Magmas from subduction 52 \nzones contribute to crustal growth and deliver volatile elements to the atmosphere. In 53 \nreturn, the mantle is fertilized by subduction of altered oceanic crust and sediments 54 \ncontaining elements derived from the continental crust and seawater (Armstrong, 55 \n1968; Armstrong, 1991; VonHuene and Scholl, 1991; VonHuene and Scholl, 1993; 56 \nPlank and Langmuir, 1998) . 57 \nQuantifying fluxes between material entering the subduction zone and volcanic 58 \noutputs requires, on one hand, an accurate estimate of the chemical and isotopic 59 \ncomposition of arc magmas and, on the other hand, a precise evaluation of the 60 \nchemical and isotopic composition of subducted materials. Such evaluations have 61 \nbeen made on a global scale by Plank and Langmuir (1998), who calculated average 62 \ncompositions for sediments subducted under various arcs as well as a global sediment 63 \ncomposition called GLOSS.  However, no complete section of basaltic crust and 64 \noverlying sediments had ever been studied for its complete trace element and isotopic 65 \ncompositions. The primary scientific objective of ODP Leg 185, which was drilled in 66 \n1999 in the western Pacific, outboard of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc, was to sample 67 \nand characterize a complete section of altered basaltic crust and overlying 68 \nsedimentary pile (Plank et al., 2000). Altered basaltic crust was drilled at Hole 801C, 69 \neast of the Mariana arc, and the sedimentary pile  and basaltic basement were sampled 70 \nat Site 1149 in front of the Izu arc.  As part of this joint international effort, we 71 \nanalyzed Nd and Hf isotopes of basaltic samples from Hole 801C and sediments 72 \ncollected at Site 1149 while other teams concentrated their efforts on the mobility of 73 \ntrace elements in the basaltic basement (Kelley et al., 2003; Reisberg et al., 2008), on 74 \nthe Sr, Nd, Pb isotopic systematics of both sediments and basalts (Hauff et al., 2003), 75 \n 5 \nor on the trace element budget of the entire sedimentary pile (Plank et al., 2007).  76 \nComparing the Nd and Hf isotopic compositions of the old altered basaltic crust with 77 \nthose of fresh Pacific MORB should provide constraints on the behavior of rare earth 78 \nelements (REE) and high field strength elements (HFSE) during alteration of oceanic 79 \ncrust.  These data will also provide a composition for oceanic crust recycled into the 80 \nmantle. In addition, Nd and Hf isotopic compositions measured on the Site 1149 81 \nsediments provide constraints on the origin of REE and HFSE in sediments deposited 82 \nin ocean basins, and can be used to evaluate the average composition of downgoing 83 \nsedimentary material in intra-oceanic subduction zones.  Our sediment results may 84 \nalso be compared to the pioneering Hf isotopic work on sediments from the western 85 \nPacific area  of Woodhead (1989) and Pearce et al. (1999).  86 \nOur work constrains the composition of the subducted materials regionally, and can 87 \nbe used to understand the genesis of the Izu-Mariana arc lavas. Western Pacific arcs 88 \nhave been exceptionally well studied, particularly for Nd and Hf isotopes (White and 89 \nPatchett, 1984; Woodhead, 1989; Elliott et al., 1997; Pearce et al., 1999; Woodhead et 90 \nal., 2001; Tollstrup and Gill, 2005; Wade et al., 2005; Stern et al., 2006). In spite of 91 \nthis, there are no good estimates of the Nd-Hf input flux to these arc systems. More 92 \ngenerally, such data on a complete section of subducted material provides an estimate 93 \nof the flux of chemical elements recycled into the mantle and can help in 94 \nunderstanding the long term evolution of the composition of the mantle as a result of 95 \nthe balance between melt extraction through volcanic activities, and recycling of 96 \nbasaltic crust and overlying sediments in subduction zones.   97 \n 98 \nSample selection 99 \nWe focused our study on two different sets of samples: the first set is the suite of 100 \ncomposite samples of basalts prepared by Kelley et al. (2003) to characterize the 101 \n 6 \nbasaltic crust entering the subduction zone and sampled at ODP Site 801C (see Figure 102 \n1). This is the oldest crust formed at fast spreading rates, and so is the reference 103 \nbasement section for much of the subducting western Pacific oceanic crust (Ludden et 104 \nal., 2006).  The second set is a selection of sediment samples from ODP Site 1149 105 \nwhich represent the sedimentary cover overlying the oceanic crust (Figure 1).  This 106 \nsite reflects all the major types of pelagic sedimentation found in the western Pacific, 107 \nincluding chert, clay, and carbonate lithologies (Plank et al., 2007).  Samples were 108 \nselected to cover the entire variability of the basaltic and sedimentary compositions 109 \nalong the cores and once weight averaged, they should represent the average 110 \ncomposition of the old Pacific plate that enters subduction zones along a large sector 111 \nof the western Pacific convergent margin.  112 \n\u2022 The basaltic basement drilled at ODP Site 801C 113 \nHole 801C (18\u00b038.5\u2019N, 156\u00b021.6\u2019E) is located in the Pigafetta Basin  (Figure 1), 950 114 \nkm east of the Mariana trench. This hole was first drilled in 1989 during ODP Leg 115 \n129 (Lancelot et al., 1990). In 1999 during ODP Leg 185, the hole was deepened to 116 \ncollect a more complete section of the altered oceanic crust (Plank et al., 2000). A 117 \ntotal thickness of 474 m was sampled and divided into eight major sequences based 118 \non petrological, mineralogical and geochemical characteristics. The uppermost 119 \nsequence consists of alkalic basalts and dolerites (about 20m thick) while lower 120 \nsequences are typical MORB with tholeiitic composition including massive flows or 121 \npillows associated with breccias, volcanoclastic material and silicic hydrothermal 122 \ndeposits (Plank et al., 2000; Barr et al., 2002; Fisk and Kelley, 2002). The upper 123 \nalkalic basalts have an Ar-Ar age of 157 Ma and the underlying MORB have ages 124 \nranging from 162 to 171 Ma (Pringle, 1992; Koppers et al., 2003a). Most basaltic 125 \nmaterials from hole 801C are altered by low temperature hydrothermal fluids and 126 \ninteraction with low-temperature seawater, and the material varies from highly altered 127 \n 7 \ninterpillow materials to better preserved massive flows. Some completely unaltered 128 \nvolcanic glasses also exist (Alt et al., 1992; Plank et al., 2000; Fisk and Kelley, 2002; 129 \nTalbi and Honnorez, 2003). 130 \nA set of composite samples was prepared by mixing powders of the various 131 \nlithologies (massive flows, pillows, breccias, volcanoclastic materials and 132 \nhydrothermal deposits) according to their respective proportions in the hole. The 133 \nprocedure followed for sample preparation, as given by Kelley et al. (2003) led to the 134 \npreparation of thirteen composites representing the flows and pillows units, the 135 \nbreccias and volcanoclastic sediments. A global composite representative of the entire 136 \nbasaltic column was also prepared. Major and trace element compositions of these 137 \ncomposites were measured by Kelley et al. (2003), stable isotopes have been 138 \npublished by Alt (2003) and Re-Os results were reported by Reisberg et al. (2008). 139 \nOur Hf and Nd isotopic compositions were obtained on the same composite samples. 140 \n 141 \n\u2022 The sedimentary pile drilled at ODP Site 1149 142 \nThe sedimentary cover subducted at the Mariana trench has been drilled and sampled 143 \nduring several DSDP and ODP campaigns (especially during the ODP Leg 129) and 144 \nis one of the best studied sedimentary piles on a subducting oceanic plate (Plank and 145 \nLangmuir, 1998). In contrast, the sedimentary pile subducted in the Izu-Bonin region, 146 \nnorth of the Mariana arc, was largely unknown and was therefore drilled at Site 1149 147 \nduring ODP leg 185 (31\u00b020.1\u2019N, 143\u00b021.8\u2019E see Figure 1). 148 \nIn the Izu-Bonin region the sediments covering the Pacific crust have a thickness of 149 \nabout 410 m and include several lithological units (figure 2): 150 \n-Unit I, at the top of the sediment pile, has a thickness of about 118 m. It 151 \nconsists of a mixture of clay minerals, siliceous planktonic microfossils (essentially 152 \n 8 \ndiatoms and radiolarians) and volcanic ash. Paleomagnetic data indicate an age from 153 \nlate Miocene (about 6.5 Ma) to late Pleistocene (younger than 0.2 Ma). 154 \n-Unit II (including subunits IIA and IIB) has a thickness of about 62 m, and 155 \nconsists almost exclusively of pelagic clays. However, in the upper part, defined as 156 \nsubunit IIA, some ash layers are present. The lowest part of unit II, called subunit IIB, 157 \nis entirely composed of pelagic clays. The transition between subunit IIB and unit III 158 \nis marked by the presence of zeolitic clays. The ages within unit II remain unknown 159 \nby lack of paleomagnetic or biostratigraphic data but the unit reflects most of the age 160 \nhistory of the site (from 6.6 Ma to 105 Ma (Plank et al., 2007)). 161 \n-Unit III mainly consists of biogenic siliceous deposits: radiolarian cherts and 162 \nradiolarian porcelanite. Some claystones were also recovered, essentially in the 163 \nuppermost and in the lowest part of the unit. The thickness of unit III is about 103 m 164 \nand its deposition age ranges from 105 to 127 Ma (Plank et al., 2007). 165 \n-Unit IV has a thickness of 126 m and is characterized by a mixture of 166 \nradiolarian cherts and porcelanite with calcareous sediments (marlstone and chalk). 167 \nAn isolated ash-rich level is also present at the top of the unit. Nannofossils preserved 168 \nin marls and chalks indicate a late Valanginian (134 Ma) to late Hauterivian (127 Ma) 169 \nage for this unit. 170 \nDiscrete samples were selected along the entire Site 1149 sedimentary column from 171 \nunit I to unit IV (Plank et al., 2000). Their major and trace element compositions were 172 \nmeasured by Plank et al. (2007) and we report here Hf and Nd isotopic compositions 173 \non a selection of this sediment set.  Eighteen samples from the various lithologies 174 \nwere selected in the different units to cover the entire compositional spectrum.  This 175 \nsame subset of samples have been studied by several investigators, and so together, 176 \nform a remarkably complete data set for elemental and isotopic compositions (Ludden 177 \n 9 \net al., 2006; Plank et al., 2007).  The measured Hf and Nd isotopic variations should 178 \ntherefore be representative of the entire sedimentary pile.  179 \n 180 \nAnalytical Procedure 181 \nHf and Nd chemical separation were performed in Grenoble and the isotopic 182 \ncompositions were measured using the VG Plasma 54 at ENS Lyon. Samples were 183 \ndissolved in Savillex beakers but dissolution in Parr bombs were also performed on 184 \nselected samples to check that complete dissolution of the sediments was achieved 185 \n(see Table 2). The analytical procedure for Hf separation was based on the method 186 \npublished by Blichert-Toft et al. (1997) which proved to be highly efficient for most 187 \nof the Site 801C composites and Site 1149 sediments, but this method failed for two 188 \nparticular sample groups (cherts and Ca-rich sediments) and had to be modified.  189 \nDetailed suggestions relative to the isolation of Hf for these two groups of sediments 190 \nare given in the appendix. Nd was isolated from the other REE using the classical 191 \nEichrom\u00ae HDEHP-coated teflon resin technique.  Hf and Nd blanks were measured 192 \nregularly by ICP-MS and were always lower than 80 pg for Hf and 235 pg for Nd; 193 \nthese values are negligible relative to the amounts of Hf and Nd present in the 194 \nsamples.  195 \nAccuracy of the isotopic measurements was monitored on the P54 at ENS Lyon using 196 \nthe JMC-475 Hf standard. The average measured \n176\nHf\/\n177\nHf ratio was 0.282163\u00b111 197 \n(1\u0002, 32 runs). Two different standards were used during Nd analysis: an internal 198 \n\u201chome\u201d Nd JMC standard which gave an average \n143\nNd\/\n144\nNd ratio of 0.512238\u00b17 199 \n(1\u0002, 12 runs) and the Nd La Jolla standard which gave an average 143Nd\/144Nd ratio of 200 \n0.511858\u00b110 (1\u0002, 8 runs). Several complete duplicate analyses were performed and 201 \nresults show that for both Nd and Hf isotopic ratios, the measurements reproduce 202 \nwithin analytical errors (\u0001 1\u0001Nd or \u0001Hf) (see Tables 1 and 2). 203 \n 10 \n 204 \nResults 205 \n\u2022 Site 801C basalt composites 206 \nHf and Nd isotopic compositions of Hole 801C composites are reported in Table 1 207 \ntogether with calculated present-day and initial \u0001Hf and \u0001Nd values. The lithology of 208 \neach composite is also indicated in the footnote. The measured and initial Hf and Nd 209 \nisotopic compositions of Hole 801C samples are plotted in Figure 3 together with 210 \nvalues for present-day mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and oceanic island basalts 211 \n(OIB). This figure shows that the MORB composites have Hf and Nd isotopes 212 \nindistinguishable from those of present day Pacific MORB.  The three alkali basalt 213 \ncomposites have very different isotopic compositions and plot in the OIB field close 214 \nto some of the Austral HIMU samples.  When compared to the four samples from site 215 \n801 (2 MORB and 2 OIB) analyzed by Pearce et al. (1999), a slight discrepancy is 216 \nobserved (see Figure 3): while the initial \u0001Hf are comparable, our analyses are 217 \nsystematically lower for Nd.  The origin of the discrepancy is unclear because our Nd 218 \nLa Jolla measurements are similar to the value mentioned by Pearce et al. (1999). 219 \n 220 \n\u2022 Site 1149 sediments 221 \nThe measured Hf and Nd isotopic ratios for Site 1149 sediments are reported in Table 222 \n2. Initial \u0001Hf and \u0001Nd values were also calculated using paleomagnetic and 223 \nbiostratigraphic ages (Bartolini, 2003) for samples from units I, III and IV. For units 224 \nIIA and IIB, ages are unknown by lack of magnetostratigraphic or biostratigraphic 225 \nrecord. However, the sedimentation rate was particularly slow during deposition of 226 \nthese units, at about 1 m\/Ma if calculated over the entire time period and it does not 227 \nseem to have varied through time. The initial Hf and Nd isotopic compositions of 228 \n 11 \nsamples from units IIA and IIB were therefore calculated using this sedimentation rate 229 \nand the depth at which samples occur. 230 \nThe initial \u0001Hf and \u0001Nd of all samples are plotted along the sedimentary column in 231 \nFigure 4. \u0001Nd(i) values define a limited range between \u20138 and \u20135 with three exceptions, 232 \ntwo samples from Unit I and one sample from Unit IV, which all have significantly 233 \nmore radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions (\u20133 to \u20131.6). Hauff et al. (2003) also 234 \nreported Nd isotopic compositions obtained on samples from the same Leg and eight 235 \nof our samples were also measured by them for Nd, Sr and Pb isotopes.  Reported 236 \nvalues are in excellent agreement and the difference between our values and those 237 \nreported by Hauff et al. (2003) is always smaller than 50 ppm.  238 \nHf isotopes do not define the same pattern as Nd isotopes: while sediments from the 239 \ntop of the column have positive \u0001Hf(i) values at about +6, samples from the bottom of 240 \nthe pile have negative \u0001Hf(i) values at about \u20135, and the change occurs gradually 241 \nthrough time.  Two samples from the bottom of the pile and one sample from the top 242 \nof the pile do not follow the general trend and have significantly more positive \u0001Hf(i) at 243 \n+10.3, +8 and +12 (see Table 2 and Figure 4). When plotted in a \u0001Hf(i) vs. \u0001Nd(i) 244 \ndiagram (Figure 5), the Site 1149 sediments can be compared to the various types of 245 \noceanic sediments that have been published in the literature. This figure shows that 246 \nalmost all Site 1149 sediments plot in the Fe-Mn crusts and nodule field, above the 247 \n\u201cterrestrial array\u201d defined by Vervoort et al. (1999). In addition, the progressive 248 \nincrease through time of \u0001Hf(i) at constant \u0001Nd(i) appears clearly: samples from unit IV 249 \nare located next to the terrestrial array while samples from unit I have the most 250 \nradiogenic Hf isotopes. Four exceptions exist, samples 7H4 and 10H3 from unit I and 251 \nsamples 16R1 and 29R1 from unit IV which have distinctively higher \u0001Hf(i) or \u0001Nd(i) 252 \nvalues and do not plot along the general sub-vertical trend (Figure 5). 253 \n 254 \n 12 \nDiscussion 255 \n-A- COMPOSITION OF THE SUBDUCTED PILE 256 \n\u2022 The basalt composites 257 \nIn Site 801C, two volcanic sequences are distinguished, a thick pile of tholeiites 258 \noverlain by a thin upper layer of more alkaline lavas. Composites of the tholeiitic 259 \nrocks were prepared according to their depth along the drill core and according to the 260 \nrock types (Kelley et al., 2003).  Suffixes on the sample name in Table 1 indicate the 261 \ndepth range mixed in the composite while the type of material is indicated as being 262 \nflows (FLO), volcaniclastics (VCL) or a mixture of the two (ALL).  In addition, a 263 \ncomposite representative of the entire tholeiitic section was prepared and called 801 264 \nSUPER.  All composites have near constant Hf and Nd isotopic compositions (see 265 \nFigure 3) with \u0001Hf and \u0001Nd values similar to those of present-day Pacific MORB 266 \n(Chauvel and Blichert-Toft, 2001), suggesting that the oceanic crust created about 167 267 \nMa ago (Pringle, 1992) originated from a mantle source equivalent to the present one.  268 \nIn addition, the similarity between this old Pacific oceanic crust and the basalts 269 \naccreting today at the ridge suggests that alteration processes occurring after basalt 270 \nformation at the ridge and during the 167 Ma of presence at the bottom of the Pacific 271 \nocean did not affect the Nd and Hf isotopes. In detail, small isotopic variations exist 272 \nbut no systematic trend can be found.  In particular, no change occurs between 273 \ncomposites from the upper, middle and lower part of the hole; in contrast, small but 274 \nmaybe systematic differences may exist between flow composites and volcaniclastic 275 \ncomposites in terms of Hf isotopes alone with slightly more radiogenic values in the 276 \nvolcaniclastics than in the flows.  However, the difference is so small that it might be 277 \nan artifact due to the limited number of analyzed samples (see Table 1). 278 \nThe top alkali basalt composites (TAB in Table 1) have \u0001Hf(i) and \u0001Nd(i) values lower 279 \nthan the tholeiitic composites and plot in the OIB field in Figure 3 close to data 280 \n 13 \nreported for two Jurassic OIB samples drilled at Site 801 and analyzed by Pearce et al. 281 \n(1999) and close to Rurutu and Raevavae, two islands in the Austral chain in 282 \nPolynesia (Chauvel et al., 1992; Chauvel et al., 1997; Lassiter et al., 2004; Pf\u00e4nder et 283 \nal., 2007) confirming the OIB characteristics suggested by previous studies (Castillo 284 \net al., 1992; Floyd and Castillo, 1992; Hauff et al., 2003). In addition, the strong 285 \nsimilarity between the Hf-Nd isotopic compositions of the alkali basalt composites 286 \nand those of Rurutu and Raevavae supports Koppers et al. (2003b) reconstruction of 287 \nthe past history of the Austral HIMU hotspot in the Western Pacific.  288 \nThe unmodified initial Hf and Nd isotopic compositions of Site 801C tholeiitic 289 \ncomposites together with the preserved isotopes of the alkali composites demonstrate 290 \nthat, when considered on the bulk scale of the crust, the overall Hf and Nd isotopic 291 \nbudget of altered basalts remains unchanged during hydrothermal and low 292 \ntemperature alteration processes. This result extends to the Hf isotopic system the 293 \nconclusions reached in previous studies by Staudigel et al. (1995) who demonstrated 294 \nthat provided samples are large enough to represent the whole rock (1-10 cm), Nd 295 \nisotopes of ocean basalts were not modified by hydrothermal alteration. 296 \n 297 \n\u2022 The sedimentary column  298 \nWith the exception of four samples discussed later, the sediments sampled at Site 299 \n1149 have initial Nd isotopic compositions that, irrespective of their lithology and 300 \nage, remain remarkably constant during the entire sedimentation history (\u0001Nd(i) vary 301 \nonly between \u20136.6 and \u20134, see Table 2 and Figure 4). In contrast, their initial \u0001Hf 302 \nvalues increase systematically through time: the oldest sediments from Unit IV have 303 \nthe lowest \u0001Hf(i) values at -5 while the most recent sediments from Unit I have positive 304 \n\u0001Hf(i) values above +5 (Figure 4). When combined in Figure 5, data points for the 305 \nentire sediment pile fall in the field defined by the Fe-Mn crusts and nodules (Godfrey 306 \n 14 \net al., 1997; Albar\u00e8de et al., 1998; David et al., 2001), and systematically above the 307 \nterrestrial array of Vervoort et al. (1999). This suggests that during the 160 Ma of 308 \noceanic sedimentation, the Hf-Nd budget of the sediments was mainly dominated  by 309 \nsources with radiogenic Hf isotopes relative to their Nd isotopic compositions, as is 310 \nthe case with the Fe-Mn crusts and nodules, and was little influenced by direct detrital 311 \ninput from the continents. The reason why the older sediments register a more crustal 312 \nsignature than the younger sediments is unclear.  Units III and IV are particularly poor 313 \nin Hf and other trace elements due to the overwhelming presence of cherts and 314 \nbiogenic carbonates (Plank et al., 2007), while Units I and II contain a significant 315 \nproportion of clays. The low \u0001Hf values of the older sediments are therefore not 316 \nassociated to a high proportion of silicates coming from a continental source. In 317 \naddition, 130 Ma ago, the sediments were deposited far away from any continent, in 318 \nthe middle of the gigantic Pacific superocean (Bartolini and Larson, 2001).    319 \nThere are four exceptions to this general trend: samples 29R1 and 16R1 from unit IV 320 \nand samples 7H4 and 10H3 from unit I.  Sample 29R1 is a calcareous marl located 321 \nfew centimeters above the basaltic basement. Plank et al. (2000; 2007) noticed that 322 \nthe lowermost sediments contain significant enrichments in metalliferous elements 323 \nsuch as Mn and Fe and these sediments were interpreted as resulting from the 324 \npresence of hydrothermal vents.  While the Nd isotopic composition reported by 325 \nHauff et al. (2003) for sample 29R1 is similar to that of other samples, its Sr and Pb 326 \nisotopic ratios are lower than in other samples. Our measured Hf isotopic composition 327 \nfor sample 29R1 is extremely radiogenic and approaches values obtained on the Site 328 \n801 basaltic basement.  We suggest therefore that the Hf isotopic value reported for 329 \nthis sample is strongly influenced by the underlying basaltic crust, most likely due to 330 \nhydrothermal sedimentation. 331 \n 15 \nSample 16R1 from Unit IV and samples 7H4 and 10H3 from Unit I contain volcanic 332 \nashes in proportions varying between 10 and 15% (Plank et al., 2007), and their 333 \nposition in Figure 5 to the right of the trend defined by the other samples in the 334 \nsedimentary pile can easily be explained by the contribution of volcanic products to 335 \nthe sediment composition. Plank et al. (2000) suggested that the volcanic ash present 336 \nin samples 7H4 and 10H3 from Unit I could very well come from the Western Pacific 337 \nvolcanic arcs such as the Izu-Bonin-Marianne arc.  This suggestion is entirely 338 \nconsistent with (a) the Hf and Nd isotopic compositions of the two samples from Unit 339 \nI, which are displaced from the sediment pile field in Figure 5 towards more 340 \nradiogenic isotopic compositions, and (b) the relationship between Sm\/Nd and \u0001Nd(i) 341 \nvalues shown in Figure 6 where samples 7H4 and 10H3 fall in between the field 342 \ndefined by the other sediments and the field defined by the Izu-Mariana volcanics. For 343 \nsample 16R1 from Unit IV, the origin of the volcanic material is more difficult to 344 \nevaluate because at the time when the sediment was deposited on the ocean floor, 345 \nabout 125 Ma ago, it was located far from any known volcanic arc, volcanic island or 346 \ncontinental arc (see Coffin et al. (2000) and Bartolini and Larson (2001) for 347 \npaleogeographic reconstruction of the Pacific plate).  However, its position in Figure 348 \n6 together with the widespread recognition of OIB-type volcanic products in this part 349 \nof the Pacific at that time (Staudigel et al., 1991; Castillo et al., 1992; Floyd et al., 350 \n1992; Lees et al., 1992; Koppers et al., 2003b) suggests that the volcanic ashes 351 \nprobably came from an ocean island located within a few hundreds of kilometers.  352 \nOur Hf and Nd isotopic measurements can be combined with trace element analyses 353 \npublished by Plank et al. (2007) to quantify the average composition of the entire 354 \nsedimentary pile. Using an approach similar to that of Plank and Langmuir (1998) we 355 \nuse discrete measurements performed on carefully selected samples representative of 356 \neach lithological unit to calculate the average composition of each lithology.  A global 357 \n 16 \naverage of the entire sedimentary pile was then calculated using the composition of 358 \neach unit composition and their relative proportion in the sediment column.  Results 359 \nare shown in Table 3 and presented in Figure 7.  The sedimentary pile drilled at Site 360 \n1149 was initially divided in five lithological units or subunits (see figure F17 in 361 \nPlank et al. (2000)). However trace element analysis (Plank et al., 2007) and Hf and 362 \nNd isotopes indicate the presence of some distinctive layers within the original units:  363 \n(a) The transition between subunit IIB and unit III consists of 10 meters of zeolitic 364 \nclays highly enriched in REE compared to the rest of unit III and subunit IIB samples 365 \n(Plank et al., 2007). We therefore treated this REE-rich layer individually when 366 \nperforming the average calculation.  367 \n(b) Samples 16R1 93-98 and 29R1 28-35 from unit IV have radiogenic Hf isotopic 368 \ncompositions compared to the other unit IV sediments (Table 2) and were considered 369 \nseparately for the average calculation. 370 \nThe Site 1149 sedimentary column has an average \u0001Nd that is negative at -5.9, but its 371 \n\u0001Hf value is positive at about +4.4.  In Figure 7, the combined values plot in the Fe-Mn 372 \ncrusts and nodules field significantly above the \u201cterrestrial array\u201d of Vervoort et al. 373 \n(1999), suggesting that the REE and Hf budget for the entire history of sedimentation 374 \nin the Pacific was dominated by mineral phases that registered a source with elevated 375 \nHf isotopes as is the case with the Fe-Mn crusts and nodules.  376 \nRemarkably similar \u0001Hf and \u0001Nd values were obtained by White et al. (1986) and 377 \nWoodhead (1989) who measured a composite sample from DSDP Site 452 located in 378 \nfront of the Mariana arc (see figures 1 & 7). It is also not very different from the 379 \nestimated average Site 801 sediment value calculated by Wade et al. (2005). This 380 \nsuggests that the average isotopic compositions obtained in this study represent a 381 \ncommon feature for the Western Pacific sedimentary cover. However, both at DSDP 382 \nSite 452 in front of the Mariana arc and at ODP Site 1149 in front of the Izu arc, the 383 \n 17 \nsedimentary columns do not include much volcanoclastic sediments (Hussong et al., 384 \n1982; Plank et al., 2000) whose presence would affect the average composition of the 385 \nsediment cover.  In other locations such as the West Pacific ODP sites 800, 801 and 386 \n802 (see figure 1) thick volcanoclastic units are present (Lancelot et al., 1990; Lees et 387 \nal., 1992) and there, the average Hf and Nd isotopic compositions would probably be 388 \ndifferent, with more radiogenic Nd and Hf isotopic values. The average Hf and Nd 389 \nisotopic compositions of DSDP Site 452 and ODP Site 1149 should therefore be 390 \nconsidered as representative of Pacific sedimentary columns dominated by pelagic 391 \nsediments. 392 \n 393 \n-B- RECYCLING OF THE SITE 1149 SEDIMENTS IN THE IZU-MARIANA ARC SYSTEM 394 \n  395 \nThe trace element and isotopic characteristics of Izu arc lavas are reported a several 396 \npapers (Notsu et al., 1983; Ikeda and Yuasa, 1989; Fryer et al., 1990; Hochstaedter et 397 \nal., 1990a; Hochstaedter et al., 1990b; Tatsumi et al., 1992; Taylor and Nesbitt, 1998; 398 \nIshikawa and Tera, 1999; Hochstaedter et al., 2000; Hochstaedter et al., 2001; 399 \nSchmidt, 2001; Straub and Layne, 2002; Straub, 2003; Straub et al., 2004) but the 400 \nnumber of samples analyzed for Hf isotopes is quite limited.  In terms of Hf and Nd 401 \nisotopic compositions, Izu lavas, together with the Mariana arc lavas, are among the 402 \nmost radiogenic arc lavas studied up to now (White and Patchett, 1984; Woodhead, 403 \n1989; Pearce et al., 1999; Woodhead et al., 2001; Tollstrup and Gill, 2005; Wade et 404 \nal., 2005; Stern et al., 2006): their Hf and Nd isotopic characteristics are not very 405 \ndifferent from those of MORB (see Figure 8).  Using our estimate of the average 406 \ncomposition of the subducted sediments, we can evaluate the proportion of sediments 407 \ninvolved in the genesis of the arc lavas.  The composition of the mantle contaminated 408 \nby the sediments is a matter of debate; it could either be Indian type MORB mantle as 409 \n 18 \nsuggested by Hickey-Vargas et al. (1998), Savov et al. (2006), Pearce et al. (1999) 410 \nand by Woodhead et al. (2001), or Pacific type MORB mantle. Here we calculated 411 \nmixing arrays using a Pacific mantle because this evaluation provides a higher 412 \nproportion of sedimentary material due to the more radiogenic Nd isotopic 413 \ncomposition of the Pacific mantle; it is therefore the maximum possible contribution 414 \nfrom the sedimentary pile. In addition, some of the data used to suggest that the 415 \nmantle wedge has \u201cIndian\u201d characteristics are ambiguous.  The samples  from the 416 \nPhilippine basement analyzed by Savov et al. (2006) and by Pearce et al. (1999) plot 417 \nin between the Indian and the Pacific MORB fields in Nd-Hf isotopic space (see 418 \nFigure 8). Moreover, the overlap between the Philippine plate and the Indian MORB 419 \nas shown by Hickey-Vargas et al. (1998) and by Savov et al. (2006) is accentuated by 420 \nusing initial ratios of the 45 Ma volcanics vs. present-day isotopic ratios for MORB.  421 \nThe age correction has a significant impact on the \n206\nPb\/\n204\nPb and \n143\nNd\/\n144\nNd ratios, 422 \nbut not on the \n207\nPb\/\n204\nPb, \n208\nPb\/\n204\nPb and \n176\nHf\/\n177\nHf ratios. When the measured 423 \nratios are compared to the present-day MORB fields, data plot at an ambiguous 424 \nintermediate position. Thus, while mantle of Indian affinity may have generated some 425 \nPhilippine basement, its distribution beneath the modern arcs is unknown, and given 426 \nthe subtle shifts in Nd and Hf that have been observed even in these \u201cIndian\u201d 427 \nprovinces, we chose the more extreme Pacific end-member to provide maximum 428 \nsediment contributions.  429 \nMixing arrays between the average subducted sediments and Pacific mantle are 430 \ncalculated using end-member compositions given in the caption of Figure 8 and 431 \nshown in Figure 8.  They fit well the data reported for both Izu and Mariana arc lavas 432 \nand suggest that less than 2% of sediment mixed with depleted mantle can reproduce 433 \nthe island arc Hf-Nd isotopic array.  This figure is very similar to the proportion of 434 \nsediment suggested by Wade et al. (2005) for the Mariana arc and it is consistent with 435 \n 19 \nestimates based on other trace elements or isotopic systems (i.e., (Tera et al., 1986; 436 \nRyan and Langmuir, 1988; Woodhead et al., 2001). If Indian type mantle were used 437 \ninstead of Pacific mantle composition, the proportion of sediment would be lower.  438 \nThe position of Site 1149 average sediment composition in the Hf-Nd isotopic space 439 \nand the shape of the mixing array in Figure 8, also suggest that the displacement of 440 \nthe Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc lavas to the left of the \u2018MORB-OIB array\u2019 could be due to 441 \nthe composition of the subducted material and not necessarily due to changes of the 442 \nNd\/Hf ratio during either dehydration or melting of the sediment component.  This is 443 \nconsistent with the relationship between Hf isotopic compositions and the Hf\/Hf* 444 \nratios shown in Figure 9a.  Wade et al. (2005) showed that by using their estimate of 445 \nthe sediment composition combined with the depleted mantle value recommended by 446 \nSalters and Stracke (2004), mixing curves did not pass through the Mariana island arc 447 \ndata field (see figures 9a & b).  They suggested that the Hf\/Hf* ratio of the depleted 448 \nmantle might be too high, but also that the Nd\/Hf ratio of the sediment involved in the 449 \nsource of the volcanic rocks had to be much higher than their sediment estimate (see 450 \nFigure 9b and their figure 8).  Using our estimate of the composition of the sediment 451 \npile, the discrepancy between mixing proportions given by the isotopic compositions 452 \n(less than 2%, see Figure 8) and by the trace element ratios (less than 4%, see figures 453 \n9a & b) is lower, but still exists. To have similar proportions of sediments in the two 454 \nfigures requires a mantle wedge with a slight Hf deficiency relative to its REE 455 \ncontent. Most of the Izu-Mariana arc lava data points can be explained by mixing of 456 \ndepleted mantle and bulk sediment.  Significant outliers are the Izu forearc lavas 457 \n(Pearce et al., 1999) which have extremely high Hf\/Hf* and low Nd\/Hf ratios and the 458 \nKasuga seamounts in the Mariana arc (Tollstrup and Gill, 2005) which have 459 \nextremely low \u0001Hf and Hf\/Hf* values and high Nd\/Hf ratios. These two datasets 460 \ncannot be explained by any simple mixing relationship and require additional 461 \n 20 \nprocesses to account for their arrays. Pearce et al. (1999) suggested that the elevated 462 \nHf\/Hf* values of the Izu protoarc lavas require a fractionation process that either 463 \nadded Hf or removed REE from the lavas while Tollstrup and Gill (2005) argued that 464 \nresidual rutile, zircon and monazite were necessary to explain the Kasuga seamount 465 \narray.  466 \nEven if the site 1149 sediments have trace element contents and Nd-Hf isotopic 467 \ncompositions suggesting that simple bulk mixing between subducted sediments and 468 \nmantle wedge could explain the Nd-Hf characteristics of the Izu-Mariana island arc 469 \nlavas, things are more complex when other isotopic systems are considered.  In 470 \nparticular, previous studies done by Elliot et al. (1997), Ishikawa and Tera (1999), 471 \nHochstaedter et al. (2001), Hauff et al. (2003) and by Straub et al.  (2004) clearly 472 \ndemonstrated that some elements were transferred from the subducted material to the 473 \nsource of volcanics through fluid phases.  Fractionation of trace elements like the 474 \nREE and the HFSE  by residual minerals during magma genesis is also required  by 475 \nthe composition of both the Izu protoarc volcanics and the Kasuga seamounts in the 476 \nMariana arc (see figures 9a & b).  477 \nWhen site 1149 data are used as the sediment contaminant in the mantle wedge below 478 \nthe Izu arc, the modeling is quite satisfactory but the number of Nd-Hf isotopic 479 \nanalyses on the Izu volcanics is so low that the constraints are relatively weak. More 480 \nanalyses of the Izu volcanics would certainly help refine the general model.  In the 481 \ncase of the Mariana arc, for which a significant number of Nd-Hf analyses has been 482 \npublished, the composition of the subducted sediment is poorly constrained: the 483 \nestimate suggested by Wade et al. (2005) for Site 801 has an \u0001Hf and a Nd\/Hf ratio 484 \nthat are too low to define a mixing array going through the arc data (see figures 8 and 485 \n9). The Site 452 clay composite analyzed by Woodhead (1989) has \u0001Hf and \u0001Nd similar 486 \nto the Site 1149 average values (Figure 8) but no trace element data have been 487 \n 21 \npublished. Finally, the Site 1149 sediments have trace element and isotopic 488 \ncompositions defining mixing arrays compatible with the Mariana arc data, but the 489 \ndrill site is not located in front of the Mariana arc, and contains different sedimentary 490 \nunits than found there (Plank et al., 2007).  The main difference between the Site 1149 491 \nand Site 801 sedimentary averages are the Cretaceous volcaniclastics that are a major 492 \npart of the sedimentary input to the Marianas trench.  These have isotopic 493 \ncompositions similar to OIB, and their inclusion in the Site 801 average is responsible 494 \nfor the lower \u0001Hf  and Nd\/Hf, and the misfits to the mixing lines. One possible solution 495 \nto the mixing problem is that Nd and Hf are retained in the volcaniclastic unit, by the 496 \npreferential stability of zircon and REE phases expected in these Zr- and REE-497 \nenriched materials (Klimm et al., 2008).  Another possibility is simply that more  data 498 \nare necessary to establish whether a geographical variability exists.  The average 499 \ncompositions of the subducted sediment pile in front of the Mariana arc and the Izu-500 \nBonin arc could then be compared and a well constrained model could be developed. 501 \nIn 2003, Straub published an overview of the temporal changes in the chemical 502 \ncomposition of the Izu Bonin\u2013Mariana arc lavas (Straub, 2003).  She demonstrated 503 \nthat over the past  50 Ma, the lava composition changed from boninitic to tholeiitic 504 \nwith an accompanying increase in TiO2 contents and \u0001Nd values. Because the Nd 505 \nisotopic composition of the sedimentary pile is quite uniform at \u0001Nd \u0001 -6.5 (see Table 506 \n2 and Figure 4), secular changes in the sediment composition cannot explain the 507 \nvariation observed in the arc lavas.  We suggest therefore that the increasingly 508 \ndepleted nature of the arc lavas might relate to a decreasing contribution of the 509 \nsediment component through time.  510 \n 511 \n-C- RECYCLING OF SEDIMENTS IN ISLAND ARCS AND IN THE MANTLE 512 \n 22 \n\u2022 Oceanic sediments and worldwide arc systems  513 \nIn more general terms, the Nd and Hf isotopic compositions of oceanic sediments can 514 \nbe compared to the arc lava isotopic array to evaluate their impact on the island arc 515 \ncompositions.  In Figure 10, we show a compilation of available data published on 516 \nisland arcs.   Not only do the data define an array that is significantly displaced to the 517 \nleft of the MORB-OIB array, but it also has a shallower slope: \u0001Hf = 1.23.\u0001Nd +6.36 vs. 518 \n\u0001Hf = 1.59.\u0001Nd+1.28.  While these values are slightly different from those published by 519 \nVervoort et al. (1999) mainly because of new data published within the last 10 years, 520 \nthey confirm the distinctive trend of arc volcanism relative to intra-plate volcanism.  It 521 \ncan be argued, as is done by Pearce et al. (1999) and by Tollstrup (2005) that the 522 \nslope of the \u201cisland arc array\u201d results of a decoupling of Nd and Hf during 523 \ndehydration and\/or melting of the subducted slab with a sedimentary component 524 \ncharacterized by elevated Nd\/Hf ratios.  However, we would like to suggest here that 525 \nthe \u201cisland arc array\u201d could also be mainly controlled by the mixing of depleted 526 \nmantle and subducted sediments. In Figure 10, we show mixing arrays between 527 \nvarious sedimentary end-members and an average depleted mantle source.  528 \nContaminating the mantle wedge with the Leg 185 average sediment produces an 529 \narray shown with a black striped line in Figure 10 that goes through the arc data with 530 \nthe highest \u0001Hf values but does not appear to be the best endmember to account for the 531 \ncomposition of most island arcs even though it can explain some arcs data (e.g., Izu, 532 \nMariana and some of the Luzon arc data). Most arc lavas lie below this mixing line 533 \nwith the arcs located next to continents (the Lesser Antilles and the Aegean arc) 534 \ndefining the lower part of the arc array.  We suggest therefore that depending on the 535 \nnature of the subducted sediments  (sands next to continental platforms, and clays, 536 \nmuds and Fe-Mn crusts further away from continental margins) a range of mixing 537 \nlines can be calculated.  In Figure 10, we show two end-member mixing lines 538 \n 23 \ncalculated using the Nd and Hf concentrations and Nd isotopic composition of 539 \nGLOSS (Plank and Langmuir, 1998) for which no Hf isotopic composition is 540 \navailable.  We therefore used a range of Hf isotopic compositions as shown by the 541 \nvertical brown line in Figure 10. The mixing line between depleted mantle and the 542 \nlow \u0001Hf sand end-member reproduces well the Lesser Antilles and Aegean arcs 543 \ncompositions while mixtures of mantle wedge and high \u0001Hf sediments reproduce the 544 \ncompositions of arcs such as Luzon and Sunda.  In most cases, the proportion of 545 \nsediments involved in the source of arc volcanism is lower than 5% if straight bulk 546 \nmixing between sediments and mantle is used.  If the sediment component is extracted 547 \nfrom the sedimentary material by either a fluid phase or a melt, the proportion of 548 \nsediment will be lower. We realize that this mixing model is quite simplistic and that 549 \na better knowledge of the oceanic sediment compositions is really necessary. As 550 \nmentioned by Plank and van Keken (2008), the diversity of \u0001Hf, \u0001Nd and associated 551 \nREE\/HFSE ratios in oceanic sediments needs to be better documented to understand 552 \nthe way sediments are involved in the arc genesis.  553 \n 554 \n\u2022 Proportions of the incoming sediment flux injected back into the mantle  555 \nOur average composition of the Site 1149 sedimentary pile can be used in conjunction 556 \nwith physical and chemical data to estimate the fraction of subducted sediments that is 557 \ntransferred directly into the arc system, and the fraction that is sent back into the 558 \nconvecting mantle. 559 \nThe sediment input flux can be evaluated using the convergence rate of the Pacific 560 \nplate, the thickness of the sediment pile, and its density, water content and average Nd 561 \nand Hf concentrations.  All these values, which are summarized in Table 4, allow 562 \nestimates of the Nd input flux from the sediment at 857 kg\/km of arc\/yr and of the Hf 563 \ninput rate at 49 kg\/km of arc\/yr. The volcanic arc output flux can be evaluated using 564 \n 24 \nthe magmatic addition rates determined by Dimalanta et al. (2002) for the Izu-Bonin 565 \narc and the average Nd and Hf concentrations of arc lavas (White and Patchett, 1984; 566 \nPearce et al., 1999). Using the values listed in Table 4, we calculate a Nd output rate 567 \nof about 1375 kg\/km of arc\/yr and a Hf output rate of about 312 kg\/km of arc\/yr. The 568 \nNd and Hf present in the arc lavas originate most probably from both the mantle 569 \nwedge and the subducted material.  Using the \u0002Nd values given in Table 4 for the 570 \naverage arc lavas, the mantle wedge and the subducted material, we can calculate that 571 \nabout 10% \u00b1 6% of the Nd present in the arc lavas comes from the subducted 572 \nsediment, i.e., 138 \u00b1 82 kg\/km of arc\/yr.  Subtracting this amount from the total 573 \namount of Nd present in the subducted sediment pile implies that about 85% \u00b1 9% of 574 \nthe sedimentary Nd is sent back into the convecting mantle.   575 \nA similar calculation carried out for Hf does not provide well-constrained proportions 576 \nbecause the \u0002Hf values of mantle wedge and arc lava are almost indistinguishable.  577 \nHowever, using the Nd\/Hf ratios of the three components, we can place limits to the 578 \nproportion of Hf from the sediment pile that is transferred to the arc lavas and the 579 \namount that is recycled into the mantle.  Assuming that the sedimentary material 580 \ninvolved in the arc lava genesis has the same Nd\/Hf ratio as the sediment itself, we 581 \nevaluate the Hf flux from sediment to arc lava as 7.9 kg\/km of arc\/yr and calculate 582 \nthat 85% \u00b1 9%  of sedimentary Hf is recycled back into the mantle.  It is very unlikely 583 \nthat the Nd\/Hf of the material coming out of the subducted material is lower than that 584 \nof the sediment because Nd is considered as more mobile in fluid phases than Hf 585 \n(Kogiso et al., 1997; Johnson and Plank, 1999).  Dehydration products are therefore 586 \nlikely to have a Nd\/Hf \u0001 17.5 and transfer less than the 7.9 kg\/km of arc\/yr calculated 587 \nabove.  This in turn suggests that a minimum of 85% of the sedimentary Hf is 588 \nrecycled back into the mantle.   589 \n 25 \nIn summary, the Nd and the Hf present in the sedimentary pile contribute to the arc 590 \nlava composition but the vast majority (\u0001 85%) is recycled into the mantle of the 591 \nEarth to affect its general isotopic composition.  Assuming that similar material has 592 \nbeen recycled into the mantle over long periods of time during Earth history, its 593 \ncomposition, which differs significantly from that of normal mantle, can create large 594 \nchemical and isotopic heterogeneities.  As already suggested by previous authors 595 \n(Hofmann and White, 1982; Chauvel et al., 1992; Blichert-Toft and Albar\u00e8de, 1999), 596 \nsuch material could be present in the source of ocean island basalts.  It could also be 597 \nmixed into the normal depleted mantle and suppress the radiogenic growth of both Nd 598 \nand Hf resulting from magmatic melt extraction of continental crust.  Such modeling 599 \nof the impact of recycled subducted oceanic basalt and sediments into the mantle over 600 \nEarth history was performed recently by Chauvel et al. (2008) for the Nd and Hf 601 \nisotopic systems and they showed that a combination of oceanic sediments and basalts 602 \ncould satisfactorily contribute to the mantle sources of both oceanic island basalts and 603 \nmid-ocean ridge basalts and explain the \u201cmantle array\u201d.    604 \nConclusion 605 \nOur Hf and Nd isotopic study of the Site 1149 sediments and the Hole 801C basaltic 606 \ncomposites leads to the following main observations: 607 \n- The similarity between Hf and Nd isotopes measured on the Site 801C basalts and 608 \npresent-day Pacific MORB suggest that both isotopic systems are unaffected by 609 \nhydrothermal processes and low temperature alteration for a period of more than 150 610 \nMa. 611 \n- The Hf and Nd isotopic compositions of Site 1149 sediments do not display a large 612 \nrange and the average composition of the entire sedimentary pile falls in the field of 613 \nFe-Mn crusts and nodules at \u0001Nd= -5.9 and \u0001Hf = +4.4.  614 \n 26 \n- The Hf and Nd isotopic composition of the Izu-Mariana arc lavas can be modeled by 615 \nmixing a Pacific type mantle wedge and less than 2% sediments and the composition 616 \nof most island arc lavas can be reproduced by mixing less than 5% oceanic sediments 617 \nwith an ordinary depleted mantle wedge. 618 \n- We evaluate that about 85% of the Nd present in the subducted sediments is 619 \nrecycled into the mantle.  For Hf, the proportion is constrained to be similar (85%) or 620 \nhigher. Consequently, most of the Nd or Hf present in the oceanic sediments is 621 \nrecycled into the mantle to create chemical heterogeneities and affect its average 622 \ncomposition.   623 \n 624 \nAcknowledgements 625 \nThis work was financially supported by the French CNRS programs \u201cInt\u00e9rieur de la 626 \nTerre\u201d and \u201cDyeti\u201d, and by the US NSF (OCE-0137110).

Trace element data of Site 1149 sediments are from 963 \nPlank et al. (2007). The Pacific Seawater field has been drawn using data published 964 \nby Piepgras et al. (1988) and Shimizu et al. (1994). Izu-Mariana arc lavas are from 965 \nWhite et al. (1984), Woodhead et al. (1989), Elliott et al. (1997), Pearce et al. (1999), 966 \nWoodhead et al. (2001), Wade et al.

Other data sources as in Figure 5. The 975 \npositions of Site 1149 sediments in the figure differ slightly from their position in 976 \n 35 \nFigure 5 because here we plot present-day measured ratios while initial ratios were 977 \nreported in Figure 5.   978 \n 979 \nFigure 8 \n176\nHf\/\n177\nHf vs. \n143\nNd\/\n144\nNd for sediments, Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc lavas and 980 \nPacific and Indian MORB showing that less than 2% sediment combined with Pacific 981 \nMORB mantle is enough to explain the composition of the arc lavas. The sediment 982 \ncomposition of Site 1149 is given in Table 4 and the depleted mantle compositions 983 \nare evaluated as follows: (a) Nd and Hf concentrations are from Salters and Stracke 984 \n(2004); (b) three different isotopic compositions were selected: our estimated average 985 \ncomposition for Pacific MORB: \u0001Nd=+9.7 and \u0001Hf=+15, the sample with the most 986 \nradiogenic Hf isotopes: \u0001Nd=+10.8 and \u0001Hf=+20.1, and the sample with the least 987 \nradiogenic Hf isotopes: \u0001Nd=+11.2 and \u0001Hf=+12.1.  Three mixing arrays are shown 988 \nbetween sediment and the three depleted mantle sources.  The mixing arrays were 989 \ncalculated assuming bulk mixtures of sediment and mantle.  The sediment proportions 990 \nare therefore maximum proportions because if the sediment component is extracted 991 \nthrough either a melt or a fluid phase, the trace element concentrations of the 992 \ncontaminant should be higher than the starting sediment concentrations. The mixing 993 \narray between Site 801 estimate (Wade et al., 2005) and average Pacific mantle 994 \nshown with a dashed brown curve passes well below the arc lava fields. If an Indian-995 \ntype mantle is used instead of a Pacific depleted mantle, the proportion of sediment 996 \nrequired to explain the Izu-Mariana arc data is even lower, at less than 1%. Data 997 \nsources as in figures 4, 5 and 6 plus sediment data from Vlastelic et al. (2005) and 998 \nPhilippine plate basement and volcanic clasts from Pearce et al. (1999) and Savov et 999 \nal. (2006). 1000 \n 1001 \n 36 \nFigure 9 (a) Hf\/Hf* vs. \u0001Hf and (b) Nd\/Hf vs. \u0001Hf showing mixing arrays between the 1002 \naverage Site 1149 sediment and the same three potential depleted mantle sources as in 1003 \nFigure 8. With the exception of the Kasuga seamounts and the Izu protoarc volcanics, 1004 \nmost Izu and Mariana arc volcanics can be explained by less than 4% sediment in the 1005 \ncontaminated mantle source.  Calculations were performed as in Figure 8 and the data 1006 \nsources are as in figures 5,6,7 and 8.  Hf\/Hf* measures the size of the primitive 1007 \nmantle normalized Hf anomaly calculated using the following equation: 1008 \nHf\/Hf*=HfN\/((NdN+SmN)\/2) and the normalizing values of Hofmann (1988) . As in 1009 \nFigure 8, the mixing array between Site 801 estimate (Wade et al., 2005) and depleted 1010 \nmantle does not intersect the island arc data field.  1011 \n 1012 \nFigure 10 \u0001Hf versus \u0001Nd diagram showing the relationship between island arc 1013 \nvolcanics and oceanic sediments.  The island arc array is shown by an orange line 1014 \nwhile the mantle array is shown by a grey line.  Field for the three main types of 1015 \noceanic sediments are from Chauvel et al. (2008) and data on circum-Antarctic 1016 \nsediments published by van de Flierdt et al. (2007) are also shown (light brown 1017 \ndiamants) but could not be distributed among the fields due to the absence of 1018 \npetrological description. Because no \u0001Hf value is available for GLOSS, its 1019 \ncomposition is represented by a vertical brown bar at \u0001Nd = -8.9.  Two typical mixing 1020 \narrays calculated using the GLOSS Nd and Hf concentrations and mantle values as 1021 \ngiven in the caption of Figure 8 are shown as brown thin curves: one using an 1022 \nelevated \u0001Hf value at about + 4 and one using a low \u0001Hf value at -13.

(1997) which proved to be highly efficient for most of the Site 1089 \n801C composites and Site 1149 sediments, but failed for two particular sample groups 1090 \nand had to be modified: (1) The Hf isolation was unsuccessful for cherts and 1091 \nporcelanites collected at Site 1149. For these samples, Hf was not efficiently 1092 \nseparated from heavy rare earth elements (HREE), and the Hf isotopic measurements 1093 \non the P54 were disturbed by isobaric interferences at mass 176 caused by Yb and Lu. 1094 \n(2) The Hf chemical separation was poorly efficient for Ca-rich samples such as the 1095 \nmarl and chalk but also for two basalt composites containing calcareous interpillow 1096 \nsediments. For these samples, the Hf recovery was extremely low and often 1097 \ninsufficient for a proper isotopic measurement on the P54. 1098 \nIn the analytical procedure of Blichert-Toft et al. (1997) Hf is separated from the 1099 \nHREE using a HF leaching technique after sample dissolution. The REE precipitate 1100 \ninto Ca-Mg fluoride salts while Hf remains in solution in the supernatant. For most 1101 \nsamples, this procedure allows an almost complete recovery of Hf in the supernatant 1102 \nsolution whereas virtually 100% of the REE are trapped into the Ca-Mg fluoride salts 1103 \n(Blichert-Toft et al., 1997). However, Blichert-Toft (2001) has shown that this 1104 \nprocedure is inadequate to separate Hf from REE in Mg-rich samples (such as 1105 \nkomatiites or picrites) because during the fluoride precipitation stage, Hf is entrained 1106 \nwith the REE leading to low Hf recovery in the supernatant. Blichert-Toft (2001) 1107 \nsuggested that the presence of high concentrations of Hf in the fluorides salts was 1108 \nprobably due to high partition coefficients for Hf in Mg\u2013rich fluorides.  1109 \n 43 \nThe low Hf recovery we experienced for Ca-rich samples suggests that a similar Hf 1110 \nprecipitation occurs during HF leaching of Ca-rich materials. On the other hand, the 1111 \nvery low Mg and Ca contents of cherts and porcelanites (CaO and MgO usually lower 1112 \nthan 1%) could explain why HREE did not quantitatively precipitate into the fluoride 1113 \nsalts during the HF leaching procedure. To confirm this interpretation, we performed 1114 \nexperiments on the partitioning of Zr, Hf and REE during HF leaching and fluoride 1115 \nprecipitation in Ca-rich and Ca-depleted samples. Three test samples were selected on 1116 \nthe basis of their major elements (Table A): one basalt from the Sunda arc moderately 1117 \nenriched in CaO (CaO = 8.38%), one limestone from southeast France rich in CaO 1118 \n(CaO = 50.61%) and one andesite from the Sunda arc with a particularly low CaO 1119 \n(CaO = 0.7%). All three samples have low MgO (3.8%, 0.6% and 5.24% respectively) 1120 \nprecluding potential trapping of HFSE in Mg-rich fluorides. 1121 \nPowders of the three samples were dissolved in savillex beakers with an HF:HNO3 1122 \nmixture (\u0001 6:1) at about 140\u00b0C for 48h and residues were leached 3 times with 1123 \nconcentrated HF as recommended by Blichert-Toft et al. (1997). HF supernatant 1124 \nsolutions and Ca-Mg fluoride salts were prepared for ICP-MS analysis with the 1125 \nexception of the fluorides formed by the Ca-rich sample because this residue resisted 1126 \nacid digestion and could not be put into solution.  Percentages of REE, Zr and Hf 1127 \nrecovered in each fraction are given in Table A and plotted in figures A 1&2. For the 1128 \nbasalt moderately enriched in Ca, the measured REE, Hf and Zr partitioning between 1129 \nCa-Mg fluoride salts and HF supernatant are similar to the results of Blichert-Toft et 1130 \nal. (1997). More than 97% of Zr and Hf are in the HF supernatant (figure A.1) while 1131 \nover 95% of the REE are in the fluoride precipitate.  Among the REE, Ce is an 1132 \nexception with only 71% in the salt, probably because of the presence of both Ce\n3+\n 1133 \nand Ce\n4+\n. As mentioned above, the fluoride salts of the Ca-rich sample could not be 1134 \nanalyzed but nevertheless only 2.2% of Zr and 0.9% of Hf were recovered in the HF 1135 \n 44 \nsupernatant solution (Table A). This result demonstrates that during HF leaching of 1136 \nCa-rich material, Zr and Hf are partitioned into the fluoride residue instead of staying 1137 \nin solution in HF. This suggests that Zr and Hf have significantly higher partition 1138 \ncoefficients for Ca-rich fluorides than for Ca-poor fluorides. In contrast to the other 1139 \ntwo samples, the Ca-depleted andesite shows distinctive features (see Figure A.2):  Zr 1140 \nand Hf are almost exclusively present in the HF supernatant (more than 99% of Zr 1141 \nand Hf) but the REE are also present in the leachate and show a progressive 1142 \nfractionation with the LREE mainly concentrated in the fluoride salt (over 80%) and 1143 \nthe HREE distributed equally between the residue and the leachate (59% of Yb in the 1144 \nsupernatant). Such distribution suggests a progressive decrease of the partition 1145 \ncoefficient from LREE to HREE in the Ca-depleted fluoride salts and an inefficient 1146 \nseparation of the REE from the HFSE using the HF leaching technique in such 1147 \nsamples.   1148 \nOur experiments demonstrate therefore that the Ca content plays a fundamental role 1149 \non the distribution of HFSE and REE between fluoride salts and supernatant solution 1150 \nduring HF leaching. For moderately Ca-rich matrices, HFSE are preferentially 1151 \nconcentrated in the leachate while REE precipitate in the fluorides; for Ca-rich 1152 \nsamples, HFSE and REE precipitate together in the fluoride residue; and finally for 1153 \nCa-depleted samples, HFSE remain in the leachate while REE are evenly distributed 1154 \nbetween fluoride salts and HF supernatant solution. Despite providing excellent 1155 \nresults for most rocks, the HF leaching procedure of Blichert-Toft et al. (1997) proves 1156 \nnot to be efficient to separate Hf from REE in Ca-rich and Ca-poor samples and the 1157 \noriginal protocol of Blichert-Toft et al.(1997) has to be modified for this type of rock 1158 \nsamples.  1159 \nFor Ca-rich samples, the HF leaching and fluoride precipitation step should be 1160 \nreplaced by a cation-exchange column separation as published by Patchett (1980) and 1161 \n 45 \nmodified by Revillon et al. (Revillon, 2000).  However this modified protocol 1162 \nsucceeds only if Ca-rich fluorides salts do not precipitate during dissolution of the 1163 \nsample. These fluorides, very resistant to acid dissolution, are likely to contain large 1164 \namounts of Hf leading to low Hf recovery. We suggest therefore that dissolution of 1165 \nCa-rich samples should be achieved either using the procedure recommended by 1166 \nBizimis et al. (2003)or using concentrated HF associated to large amounts of HClO4 1167 \nor using lithium metaborate fusion as described in Lef\u00e8vre and Pin (2001).  For Ca-1168 \ndepleted samples, the modified procedure consists simply in a column separation 1169 \nusing cation-exchange resin instead of Hf leaching.  In this case, REE are recovered 1170 \nfrom the cation-exchange column. In all cases, Nd is further isolated from the other 1171 \nREE using Eichrom\u00ae HDEHP-coated teflon resin.  1172 \n 1173 \n 1174 \n 1175 \nAppendix Figure A REE, Zr and Hf distributions between supernatant and fluoride 1176 \nsalts after HF leaching of (1) a sample moderately enriched in Ca and (2) a Ca-1177 \ndepleted sample. 1178 \n 1179 \nAppendix Table A: Trace element distributions after HF leaching of Ca-moderately enriched, Ca-highly enriched and Ca-depleted samples. 1180 \n 1181 \nSample 80J102a  287Cb  PC6Ba \nRock Type Basalt  Limestone  Andesite \nLocation Sunda arc  SE France  Sunda arc \nCaO% 8.38  50.61  0.70 \nMgO% 3.80  0.60  5.24 \n        \nElement c \nFluoride \n(%) \nSupernatant \n(%) \n \nSupernatant \n(%) \n Fluoride (%) \nSupernatant \n(%) \nLa 93.4 6.6  0  89.5 10.5 \nCe 71.5 28.5  0  6.2 93.8 \nPr 95.8 4.2  0  86.5 13.5 \nNd 96.2 3.8  0  84.7 15.3 \nSm 96.8 3.2  0  74.7 25.3 \nZr 3.7 96.3  0.2  0.6 99.4 \nHf 3.6 96.4  0  1.0 99.0 \nEu 95.8 4.2  0.1  68.2 31.8 \nGd 94.9 5.1  0  61.9 38.1 \nTb 96.9 3.1  0  55.2 44.8 \nDy 97.1 2.9  0  50.5 49.5 \nHo 97.1 2.9  0  47.0 53.0 \nEr 97.1 2.9  0  43.7 56.3 \nYb 96.3 3.7  0  40.9 59.1 \nLu 96.4 3.6  0.6  39.4 60.6 \n 1182 \nFootnote: 1183 \na CaO and MgO compositions after Polv\u00e9 and Maury, Unpublished data. 1184 \nb CaO and MgO compositions after Nicod and Chauvel, Unpublished data. 1185 \nc Determined by ICP-MS (VG Plasma Quad, University of Grenoble).
