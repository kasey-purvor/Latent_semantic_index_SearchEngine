One of the key findings of this review is that the methods used in analysing \nand forecasting the demand for tourism have been more diverse than those identified by \nother review articles. In addition to the most popular time series and econometric models, \na number of new techniques have emerged in the literature. However, as far as the \nforecasting accuracy is concerned, the study shows that there is no single model that \nconsistently outperforms other models in all situations.

Introduction \nAlong with the phenomenal growth in demand for tourism in the world over the past \ntwo decades is a growing interest in tourism research. Twenty years ago there were only a \nhandful of academic journals that published tourism related research. Now there are more \nthan 70 journals that serve a thriving research community covering more than 3,000 \ntertiary institutions across five continents. Being one of the important areas in tourism \nresearch, tourism demand modelling and forecasting has attracted much attention of both \nacademics and practitioners. According to a comprehensive review by Li et al (2005), \n                                                 \n1\n Corresponding author (hmsong@polyu.edu.hk). The authors acknowledge the financial support of the \nHong Kong University Grants Council\u2019s Competitive Earmarked Research Grant - B-Q976.   \n 2 \n420 studies on this topic were published during the period 1960-2002. The majority of \nthese studies focus on the application of different techniques, both qualitative and \nquantitative, to model and forecast the demand for tourism in various destinations. These \nstudies also attempted to establish forecasting principles that could be used to guide the \npractitioners in selecting forecasting techniques. However, this effort has not been \nsuccessful. As Witt and Song (2000) and Li et al (2005) concluded, the performance of \nthe forecasting models varies according to the data frequencies used in the model \nestimation, the destination-origin country\/region pairs under consideration and the length \nof the forecasting horizons concerned. There has not been a panacea for tourism demand \nforecasting.  \n \nA number of review articles on tourism demand forecasting have been published over \nthe last decade and these include Crouch (1994), Li et al (2005), Lim (1997a, 1997b and \n1999) and Witt and Witt (1995). These reviews cover the studies published mostly during \nthe period 1960-2000. Although a few studies published between 2000 and 2004 are \nincluded in the latest review of Li et al (2005), the focus of that review was on the \neconometric approach only. This paper does not attempt to duplicate the efforts made by \nprevious researchers in reviewing the pre-2000 publications and only concentrates on the \nmost recent publications since 2000. The current review provides a full account of all \nmethods used in tourism demand modelling and forecasting, including time series models, \nthe econometric approach as well as some emerging new statistical and non-statistical \nmethods. The main objective is, therefore, to investigate whether there are any new \ntrends\/issues emerging recently in tourism forecasting literature and to suggest new \ndirections for future research based on the new trends and issues identified. \n \nThe authors conducted a search on various databases such as the social science citation \nindex (SSCI), Google Scholar, and citations from published articles. One hundred and \ntwenty one journal papers on tourism demand modelling and forecasting published since \n2000 are identified. A full list of these articles is provided in Table 1. The review is \ntherefore based on these 121 studies and the emphasis is placed on the following issues: \nthe latest methodological developments, forecast competition, combination and \nintegration, tourism cycles, turning points, directional changes and seasonality analysis, \nevents\u2019 impact analysis and risk forecasting in addition to some general observations.  \n \n \n 3 \nTable 1  \n \nSummary of Post-2000 Tourism Demand Modelling and Forecasting Studies \nLegend \n1.

Although the explanatory variables \nincluded in the tourism demand models vary enormously with research objectives and \nresearchers\u2019 backgrounds, the employment of certain indicators as the measurement of \ntourism demand variables in modelling and forecasting tourism demand have been less \ncontroversial as suggested in Witt and Song (2000).    \n \nThe tourist arrivals variable is still the most popular measure of tourism demand over \nthe past few years. Specifically, this variable was measured by total tourist arrivals from \nan origin to a destination, which could be decomposed further into holiday tourist arrivals, \nbusiness tourist arrivals, tourist arrivals for visiting friends and relatives (VFR) purposes \n(e.g., Turner and Witt, 2001a, 2001b, and Kulendran and Wong, 2005, respectively), and \ntourist arrivals by air (Coshall, 2005; Rossell\u00f3-Nadal, 2001). Some studies used tourist \nexpenditure in the destination as the demand variable (such as Li et al, 2004, 2006a and \n2006b) and others employed tourist expenditure on particular tourism product categories, \nsuch as meal expenditure (Au and Law, 2002), sightseeing expenditure (Au and Law, \n2000), and shopping (Law and Au, 2000). Other tourism demand variables used in the \nliterature include tourism revenues (Akal, 2004), tourism employment (Witt et al, 2004) \nand tourism import and export (Smeral, 2004). \n \nSince research on tourism demand modelling and forecasting relies on secondary data, \nthe availability of the data determines, to a large extent, the coverage of the geographical \nareas where sophisticated forecasting methodologies were used to generate reliable \nforecasts. The USA, UK, and France are the most popular researched countries as both \ndestinations and countries of origin. Australia, Spain, Hong Kong, Korea and Mainland \nChina are researched frequently as tourist destinations, whereas Germany and Japan are \ngenerally regarded as key source markets for international tourism. Overall, the USA and \nWestern Europe, as traditional international tourism markets, still attract considerable \nattention in recent empirical research. Meanwhile, due to its fast and stable growth and \npromising future as the UNWTO predicts, Asia has gained increasing interest in tourism \ndemand modelling and forecasting studies.  \n \nOver the past 7 years, tourism demand forecasting articles have mainly been published \nin some of the key tourism journals such as Tourism Management, Tourism Economics, \nJournal of Travel Research, Annals of Tourism Research and Journal of Travel and \nTourism Marketing. However, a few economics and management journals, such as \nApplied Economics and International Journal of Forecasting have also published tourism \ndemand forecasting studies but with a lower frequency. Table 2 summarises the \nfrequencies of tourism forecasting studies published in the above mentioned journals \nduring the period 2000-2006.  \n  \n  \n 10 \n2.2. Methodological Developments \nTourism demand modelling and forecasting methods can be broadly divided into two \ncategories: quantitative and qualitative methods. In their study, Song and Turner (2006) \nconcluded that the majority of the published studies used quantitative methods to forecast \ntourism demand. The quantitative forecasting literature is dominated by two sub-\ncategories of methods: non-causal time series models and the causal econometric \napproaches. The difference between them is whether the forecasting model identifies any \ncausal relationship between the tourism demand variable and its influencing factors.  \n \nIn the 121 post-2000 empirical studies reviewed in this paper, quantitative forecasting \ntechniques were applied in all except two studies (Prideaux et al, 2003; Schwartz and \nCohen, 2004). Out of these 121 studies, 72 used the time series techniques to model the \ndemand for tourism.  68 of these 72 studies generated either ex post forecasts or ex ante \nforecasts while only 4 of them did not generate any forecast. Meanwhile, a variety of \neconometric models appeared in 71 studies. Among them 30 concentrated on the \nidentification of the relationships between tourism demand and its influencing factors \nwhile 41 evaluated the forecasting performance of the econometric models in addition to \nthe identification of the causal relationships. Amongst these 71 studies that employed \neconometric models, more than 30 of them applied both the time series and econometric \napproaches in estimating the tourism demand models and compared the forecasting \nperformance of these models. In addition to the studies utilising the time series and \neconometric techniques, 11 studies also employed other forecasting techniques, which \nmostly fall into the category of artificial intelligence methods. Compared with the \npublished studies prior to 2000, forecasting methodologies have been more diverse in the \nnew millennium.   \n \nTime series models \nA time series model explains a variable with regard to its own past and a random \ndisturbance term. Particular attention is paid to exploring the historic trends and patterns \n(such as seasonality) of the time series involved, and to predict the future of this series \nbased on the trends and patterns identified in the model.  Since time series models only \nrequire historical observations of a variable, it is less costly in data collection and model \nestimation.  \n \nTime series models have been widely used for tourism demand forecasting in the past \nfour decades with the dominance of the integrated autoregressive moving-average models \n(ARIMAs) proposed by Box and Jenkins (1970). Different versions of the ARIMA \nmodels have been applied in over two-thirds of the post-2000 studies that utilised the \ntime series forecasting techniques. Depending on the frequency of the time series, either \nsimple ARIMA or seasonal ARIMA (i.e. SARIMA) models could be used with the latter \ngaining an increasing popularity over the last few years, as seasonality is such a dominant \nfeature of the tourism industry that decision makers are very much interested in the \nseasonal variation in tourism demand. With regard to the forecasting performance of the \nARIMA and SARIMA models, empirical studies present contradictory evidence. For \nexample, Cho (2001) showed that the ARIMA model outperformed two other time series \nmodels in all cases. Goh and Law (2002) suggested that the SARIMA models \n 11 \noutperformed eight other time series methods while the non-seasonal (simple) ARIMA \nmodel\u2019s performance was above the average of all forecasting models considered. \nHowever, Smeral and W\u00fcger (2005) found that the ARIMA or SARIMA model could not \neven outperform the Na\u00efve 1 (no-change) model.  \n \nConsidering the inconsistency in forecasting performance of the ARIMA\/SARIMA \nmodels, researchers have recently tried to improve the forecasting performance of the \nARIMA\/SARIMA by using alternative time series approaches. One of the efforts has \nbeen to extend the univariate time series models to a multivariate dimension, and to \nexamine if the additional information involved in the \u201cparallel\u201d time series (e.g. tourism \ndemand for a destination by a number of origin countries\/regions) may contribute to the \nimprovement of forecast accuracy. For example, Goh and Law (2002) introduced a \nmultivariate SARIMA (i.e. MARIMA) model which includes an intervention function to \ncapture the potential spill-over effects of the \u201cparallel\u201d demand series on a particular  \ntourism demand series. Their study showed that the multivariate SARIMA model \nsignificantly improved the forecasting performance of the simple SARIMA as well as \nother univariate time series models. However, in a similar attempt, Gustavsson and \nNordstr\u00f6m (2001) found that their multivariate ARIMA model could not beat its \nunivariate counterpart. Moreover, Du Preez and Witt (2003) investigated the intervention \neffects of the time series models on forecasting performance within a state space \nframework. It was found that the multivariate state space time series model was \noutperformed by the simple ARIMA model. The authors argued that the unsatisfactory \nforecasting performance of the multivariate state space time series model was attributed \nmainly to the absence of a \u201crich\u201d cross-correlation structure amongst \u201cparallel\u201d demand \nseries.  \n \nAnother extension of the univariate time series analysis of tourism demand has been \nthe application of the Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) \nmodel. GARCH models have been widely used in the financial modelling context to \ninvestigate the volatility of the time series. Chan et al (2005) applied three multivariate \nGARCH models to examine the volatility of tourism demand and the effects of various \nshocks in the tourism demand models. They found that tourism demand was affected by \nthe conditional variances of the models that underline the demand for Australian tourism \nby the four leading tourism source markets. However, the forecasting performance of \nthese multivariate GARCH models was not assessed. \n \nNa\u00efve 1 (or no-change), na\u00efve 2 (or constant-growth-rate), exponential smoothing \nmodels, and simple autoregressive models have also appeared frequently in the post-2000 \nstudies, but as in earlier tourism forecasting studies, they are usually used as benchmarks \nfor forecasting accuracy evaluation. \n \nEconometric models \nOne of the major advantages of the econometric approaches over the time series \nmodels lies in their ability to analyse the causal relationships between the tourism \ndemand (dependent) variable and its influencing factors (explanatory variables). \nEconometric analysis \u201cfulfils many useful roles other than just being a device for \n 12 \ngenerating forecasts; for example, such models consolidate existing empirical and \ntheoretical knowledge of how economies function, provide a framework for a progressive \nresearch strategy, and help explain their own failures\u201d (Clements and Hendry, 1998, p16). \nAs far as tourism demand is concerned, econometric analysis has its empirical usefulness \nin interpreting the change of tourism demand from an economist\u2019s perspective, proving \npolicy recommendations as well as evaluating the effectiveness of the existing tourism \npolicies. On the contrary, a time series model cannot help under circumstances in which \ninterdependent relationships among tourism demand and other related factors are major \nconcerns of businesses and governments.  \n \nAs far as the influencing factors are concerned, recent econometric studies of tourism \ndemand have shown that tourists\u2019 income, tourism prices in a destination relative to those \nin the origin country, tourism prices in the competing destinations (i.e., substitute prices) \nand exchange rates are the most important determinants of tourism demand. This finding \nis consistent with the previous reviews such as Li et al (2005) and Lim (1999). \nIdentifying the determinants of tourism demand and estimating magnitudes of their \ninfluence on tourism demand are of great interest to decision-makers in tourist \ndestinations. For example, if tourism prices and substitute prices are identified as \nsignificant determinants, the destination concerned should pay close attention to its \ncompetitors\u2019 pricing strategies. Once a competitor launches a new strategy such as a \npromotion campaign, the destination concerned should take prompt actions accordingly \nin order to sustain its competitiveness. Therefore, the employment of appropriate \neconometric models in tourism demand forecasting is crucial not only for academic \nresearchers but also for tourism practitioners.    \n \nIn order to avoid the spurious regression which often appears in traditional regression \nanalysis based on ordinary least squares (OLS), great effort has been made to further \nadvance the econometric approach in the context of tourism modelling and forecasting. \nModern econometric methods, such as the autoregressive distributed lag model (ADLM), \nthe error correction model (ECM), the vector autoregressive (VAR) model, and the time \nvarying parameter (TVP) models, have emerged as the main forecasting methods in the \ncurrent tourism demand forecasting literature (the technical illustration of these methods \ncould be found in Song and Witt, 2000). Given the number of destinations (or source \nmarkets) being considered in an outbound (or inbound) tourism demand analysis, the \nsame number of models are required, as each model concerns only one origin-destination \npair. Apart from the VAR model, these modern econometric models are known as the \nsingle-equation modelling approach, and the explanatory variables included in the models \nshould be exogenous. The VAR model, on the other hand, treats all variables as \nendogenous, and each variable is specified as a linear relationship of the others.  \n \nAll of the above models frequently appear in recent tourism literature. For example, \nECM was used in the studies of Kulendran, and Wilson (2000), Kulendran and Witt \n(2003b), Lim and McAleer (2001), Song and Witt (2000). The VAR model can be found \nin Shan and Wilson (2004), Song and Witt (2006), Witt et al (2004). ADLM was \nemployed in such studies as Song et al (2003a) and Song et al (2003c). The latest \ndevelopment of the single-equation modelling approach in the tourism context can be \n 13 \nseen in Li et al (2006b), who integrated the merits of the TVP model and ECM to \ndevelop a more advanced TVP-ECM. With regard to forecasting performance, these \nmodern econometric models generally predict well. For instance, Kulendran, and Wilson \n(2000) showed that ECM outperforms SARIMA and Na\u00efve 1. Song et al (2000) also \nshowed superior performance of ECM. Song et al (2003a) concluded that the TVP model \ngenerates the most accurate one-step-ahead forecasts compared with five other \neconometric models, an ARIMA model and the Na\u00efve 1 model. Li et al (2006b) found \nthe overwhelming forecasting strength of TVP-ECM over a number of econometric \nalternatives and time-series models, as far as both the demand level and demand growth \nforecasts are concerned. Following the TVP-ECM, the TVP long-run model turned out to \nbe the second most accurate model as far as the overall forecasting evaluations across \nfour forecasting horizons were concerned. Up to now, the TVP long-run forecasting \nmodel and TVP-ECM short-run model have not been applied extensively in the tourism \ncontext, and further effort is needed to investigate their performance in forecasting \ntourism demand in a variety of tourism settings. Many of the above studies suggested that \nthe classical VAR model did not perform well in the forecasting competition as compared \nwith other modern econometric techniques. Wong et al (2006) developed three Bayesian \nVAR models by introducing different restrictions (priors) to the unrestricted VAR model, \nand found significant improvements of forecast accuracy. However, their forecasting \nperformance relative to other modern econometric models such as ECM and TVP models \nwas not evaluated in this study and this should be of interest to researchers in the future.   \n \nThe almost ideal demand system (AIDS) model was developed by Deaton and \nMuellbauer (1980). It is a new modelling technique that has been recently applied to \ntourism demand analysis. Different from the single-equation econometric models, AIDS \nis a system-of-equations approach, normally employed to examine tourism demand in a \nnumber of neighbouring destinations by a source market, and uses tourism expenditure \nshares as dependent variables.  The AIDS approach has a much stronger underpinning of \neconomic theory. Hence, it is more powerful than its single-equation counterparts with \nrespect to tourism demand elasticity analysis, such as substitution and complementary \neffects between alternative destinations under study. The AIDS modelling approach first \nappeared in the tourism literature in the early 1980s, and by the end of the last century \nthere had been only five applications: Fujii et al (1985), O\u2019Hagan and Harrison (1984), \nPapatheodorou (1999), Syriopoulos and Sinclair (1993) and White (1985). All of these \nstudies adopted the original static version of AIDS specification. However, the past few \nyears have seen an increasing interest in applying and further developing this method for \ntourism demand analysis. Eleven studies have employed various versions of AIDS for \ntourism demand modelling and forecasting during the period 2000-2006, and particular \nattention has been paid to the dynamics of tourism demand systems. For example, De \nMello and Fortuna (2005), Durbarry and Sinclair (2003), Li et al (2004), and Mangion et \nal (2005) all combined ECM with the linear AIDS (LAIDS) model (i.e., EC-LAIDS). Li \net al (2006a) further combined the TVP model along with the long-run LAIDS and EC-\nLAIDS to establish TVP-LR-AIDS and TVP-EC-LAIDS models, respectively. In \naddition to the demand elasticity analysis, forecasting performance of various AIDS \nmodels was evaluated in five out of eleven studies. For instance, Li et al (2004) showed \nEC-LAIDS model\u2019s superior forecasting performance over its static counterpart. Li et al \n 14 \n(2006a) demonstrated that TVP-LR-AIDS and TVP-EC-LAIDS outperformed their \nfixed-parameter counterparts in the overall evaluation of demand level forecasts. De \nMello and Nell (2005) also examined the forecasting performance of the static AIDS in \ncomparison with three VAR models. No significant difference was found between their \none-step-ahead forecasting performance. As far as the multi-step forecasting is concerned, \nthe static AIDS outperforms the unrestricted and first differenced VAR models but not \nthe restricted VAR model with identified cointegration relationships. Comparison of \nforecasting performance between various dynamic LAIDS models and the cointegrated \nVAR model will be of great interest in future studies. Given the theoretical merits of \nAIDS with regard to its ability in examining the substitution effect, this method is highly \nsuitable for analysing the destination competitiveness. \n \nPanel data analysis has some advantages over the time series econometric models. It \nincorporates much richer information from both time series and cross sectional data. This \napproach also reduces the problem of multicollinearity and provides more degrees of \nfreedom in the model estimation. Therefore, it is suitable for forecasting the demand for \ntourism when the time series for all variables are shorter, and cross-sectional information \non these variables are also available. In spite of its advantages, the panel data approach \nhas rarely been applied to tourism demand analysis. Four exceptions are found in the \npost-2000 literature. Ledesma-Rodr\u00edguez and Navarro-Ib\u00e1nez (2001) used the panel data \nmethod to model the demand for Tenerife tourism and established both static and \ndynamic panel models. In addition, Naud\u00e9 and Saayman (2005)  and Roget and Gonz\u00e1lez \n(2006) both employed the same panel data approach to examine demand for tourism in 43 \nAfrican countries and the demand for rural tourism in Galicia, Spain, respectively. \nSimilarly, Sakai et al (2000) used the panel data approach to analyse the effects of \ndemographic change on Japanese people\u2019s travel propensity. However, the forecasting \nability of this approach has not yet been investigated in the tourism literature. \n \nThe structural equation model (SEM) has been widely used in the social and \nbehavioural sciences, management, and a variety of other disciplines, including tourist \nbehaviour and tourism marketing research. Unlike the more traditional multivariate \nregression models, SEMs are simultaneous equations models, in which variables may \ninfluence one another reciprocally. Since a SEM can represent causal relationships \namong variables, it is suitable for tourism demand modelling. However, only one study \n(Turner and Witt, 2001a) has been found in the post-2000 literature. Turner and Witt \n(2001a) developed a SEM to estimate the relationships between all the explanatory \nvariables for three types of tourist flows (holidays, business visits and VFR). This study \ndemonstrated the potential of SEMs in widening the variety of explanatory factors \nworking together in a complex manner. Further applications of this approach and \nexamination of its forecasting performance are recommended for future studies. \n  \nOther quantitative models \nIn addition to the time series and econometric models, a number of new quantitative \nforecasting methods, predominantly artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, have emerged \nin the tourism forecasting literature. AI has grown rapidly as a field of research across a \nvariety of disciplines in recent years. Traditionally, AI used techniques derived from rule-\n 15 \nbased and logic programming systems, while the current interest has been focused on less \nprecise heuristic methods, notably genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic, artificial neural \nnetworks and support vector machine(s) (Toshinori, 1998). The main advantage of AI \ntechniques is that it does not require any preliminary or additional information about data \nsuch as distribution and probability. These AI techniques have been applied to tourism \nforecasting in some of the recent studies.  \n \nThe artificial neural network (ANN) method The ANN method is a computing \ntechnique that tries to imitate the learning process of a human brain (Law, 2000). The \nunique features of ANNs, such as the ability to adapt to imperfect data, nonlinearity, and \narbiter function mapping, make this method a useful alternative to the classical (statistic) \nregression forecasting models. The ANN method was first introduced to tourism \nforecasting in the late 1990s and some improved ANNs continued to appear in the post-\n2000 literature. Kon and Turner (2005) provided a review of the applications of this \nmethod in tourism. Empirical evidence shows that ANNs generally outperform the \nclassical time series and multiple regression models in tourism forecasting. For example, \nBurger et al (2001) showed that the ANN method was the best performing model over \nthe na\u00efve 1, decomposition, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, multiple regression and \ngenetic regression models. Similar findings were also obtained by Cho (2003) who \nconcluded that the ANN model outperforms the exponential smoothing and ARIMA \nmodels in modelling and forecasting the demand for Hong Kong tourism. Kon and \nTurner (2005) demonstrated that the ANN method outperforms the basic structural time \nseries, na\u00efve 1 and Holt-Winters models in forecasting the inbound tourism demand for \nSingapore. Despite the satisfactory forecasting performance, the ANN method does not \nhave a systematic procedure for model building, and a reliable forecasting model is \nusually achieved through trial-and-error experiments (Kon and Turner, 2005; Palmer et al, \n2006).  \n \nThe rough set approach  The rough set theory deals with the classificatory analysis \nof imprecise, uncertain, or incomplete knowledge (data) by incorporating the classical set \ntheory (Au and Law, 2000, p70). The rough set approach is a decision rule induction \nmethod to model the relations that exist amongst a set of mixed numeric and non-numeric \nvariables. Its applications to tourism demand analysis can be seen in Au and Law (2000; \n2002) and Law and Au (2000) for tourism shopping, dining and sightseeing expenditure \nanalyses, respectively. Different from the classical regression models, the rough set \napproach pays much attention to the categorical variables such as demographic features \nand predicts tourism demand levels (instead of exact values) in relation to each \ndemographic category according to the modelled relationships among these variables. \nTherefore, it is regarded as a useful complementary tool to econometric models for \nanalysing tourism demand from a micro perspective.   \n \nThe fuzzy time series method The fuzzy time series method has strengths in \nanalysing a short time series with limited past observations. Similarly, grey theory \nfocuses on model uncertainty and information insufficiency. Wang (2004) applied the \nfuzzy time series and the grey theory to tourism demand forecasting. Three models \nincluding the fuzzy time series, a grey model and a Markov modified grey model were \n 16 \ndeveloped to model and forecast tourist arrivals to Taiwan from Hong Kong, Germany \nand the USA using only twelve annual data. The forecasting performance of the three \nmodels depends on the origin country concerned and none can outperform the others in \nall cases. Consistency of the forecasting performance of the fuzzy time series models \nneeds further research. \n \nGenetic Algorithms (GAs) GAs are adaptive heuristic search algorithms premised on \nthe evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics. The GA is generally recognised \nas an optimisation approach. Recent studies (e.g., Burger et al, 2001; Hern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez, \n2004; Hern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez and C\u00e1ceres-Hern\u00e1ndez, 2007) demonstrated that GAs are \nsuitable for explaining changes in the composition of tourism demand. The support \nvector machine (SVM) is another AI technique that can be used in solving the \nclassification, nonlinear regression estimation and forecasting problems. A SVM \napproach with GAs is presented in Pai et al (2006) who forecasted the demand for \ntourism in Barbados. Empirical evidence shows that the SVM was superior to AIRMA \nand SARIMA models in forecasting tourism demand. The authors suggested that the \nproposed model should be extended to incorporate explanatory variables in future studies. \nIts forecasting performance compared to modern econometric models would also be \nworth investigating. \n \nDespite the unique characteristics (such as no requirement for data distribution) and \nsome empirical evidence of relatively high degrees of forecast accuracy, AI techniques \nembody some important limitations. For example, they lack a theoretical underpinning, \nand are unable to interpret tourism demand from the economic perspective, and therefore \nprovide very little help in policy evaluation. This restricts the scope of practical \napplications of AI techniques in tourism demand analysis. \n \n2.3. Competition, combination and integration of forecasts \nForecasting competitions between alternative methods were carried out in 55 out of the \n121 post-2000 studies. Although various models showed some degrees of relative \nforecast accuracy under specific situations, no single method could outperform others on \nall occasions. Some common issues are identified in the recent forecasting competition \nstudies. Firstly, only a limited number of models were selected for forecasting \ncompetition, and no clear justifications were given as to why these candidates instead of \nothers were chosen in the forecasting competition. In most cases less than 5 models were \nselected, and these sometimes included alternative versions of the same type of models. \nTherefore, the conclusions drawn are subject to very specific conditions. Secondly, in a \nnumber of competitions, traditional OLS static regression was often selected to represent \nthe econometric approach ignoring the well documented and widely used modern \neconometric techniques. It is not surprising that the OLS regression could hardly win the \ncompetition in these studies due to spurious regression and lack of dynamics. In fact, \nthese problems could be easily overcome by most of the modern econometric techniques.   \nPossibly due to researchers\u2019 fields of specialisation, these advanced econometric models \nare normally omitted from these competitions. Thirdly, in a forecasting competition \nwhere modern econometric approaches were emphasised and annual data were used, the \ntime series models usually did not show their advantage and this may be due to the fact \n 17 \nthat the time series models such as SARIMA are useful mainly for higher frequency data \nrather than annual data. Lastly, forecast performance has mostly been evaluated by non-\nstatistical measures such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean square \npercentage error (RSPE). Statistical tests for forecast differences are rarely used except \nDe Mello and Nell (2005), Kon and Turner (2005) and Witt et al (2003). Without the \nsupport of statistical testing, it would be difficult to assert whether one model is \nsignificantly better than others in forecasting. Additional attention should be given to \nthese issues in future forecasting competitions. \n \nAs previous review articles identified, the data frequency, origin\/destination pairs, \nforecasting horizon, number of competing models included in the forecasting exercise, \nand the variables to be forecasted (demand level or growth) all influence a model\u2019s \nrelative forecasting performance. Recent empirical studies have further confirmed that \nthere is no exclusive winner in tourism demand forecasting competitions. Some \nresearchers have attempted to combine the forecasts generated from different models in \norder to improve the forecasting accuracy. General forecasting literature suggests that \nforecast combination can improve forecasting accuracy (Armstrong, 2001).  Oh and \nMorzuch (2005) showed that the combined forecasts (based on the simple average) of \nfour competing time series models always outperform the poorest individual forecasts, \nand sometimes even perform better than the best individual model. Wong et al (2007) \nadvanced the study on forecast combination in the context of Hong Kong inbound \ntourism forecasting and drew a similar conclusion that combined forecasts can generally \noutperform the worst individual forecasts, thereby risk of complete forecast failure could \nbe reduced through forecast combination. Although both studies showed the usefulness of \nforecast combination in tourism forecasting, more efforts are needed to look at the \nforecasting accuracy improvement through forecast combinations.  For example, more \ncomplex combination techniques, additional advanced individual forecasting methods \nand multiple forecasting horizons should all be considered in future studies.  \n \nTo overcome the limitations of quantitative forecasting approaches and further \nimprove forecast accuracy, researchers have also tried to integrate the quantitative \nforecasting methods with qualitative alternatives. The method that \u201cactively engages \ndecision makers in the forecasting exercise contributes more to the broader strategic \nplanning process than one that does not\u201d (Tideswell et al, 2001, p163). The application of \nthis approach is reported in the study of Tideswell et al (2001). The integrative approach \nintroduced in this study combines statistical techniques with expert opinions in a quasi-\nDelphi process. This approach was employed to forecast South Australia\u2019s international \nand domestic tourism markets. The empirical results showed that this approach \nperformed well overall for the international markets (MAPE 3.0% only), but \nunsatisfactorily for some domestic market segments.   \n \n3. Forecasting tourism cycles, turning points and directional changes \nTourism growth cycles and thereby the turning point or directional change forecasting \nis another important aspect in tourism forecasting research. It has a high practical value \nbecause tourism-related firms are keen to know not only the overall trends of tourism \ndemand, but also the timing of the directional change in tourism growth. This knowledge \n 18 \nwill contribute to the effectiveness of both business planning in the private sector and \nmacroeconomic policy making in the public sector. Despite the practical importance, \nthere has been limited literature focusing on this issue. Coshall (2000) employed spectral \nanalysis to detect cycles within and between the time series of tourism flows by air and \nsea from the UK to France, Belgium and the Netherlands. The univariate spectral analysis \nfound no business cycle-type oscillations except the seasonal cycles. However, the cross-\nspectral analysis identified the cycles of dependence of passenger flows on the exchange \nrate changes. Gouveia and Rodrigues (2005) used a non-parametric method to identify \nthe tourism growth cycles using the data on monthly tourist nights spent in hotel \naccommodation in the Algarve from the main source markets. It concluded that there is a \ntime lag between tourism demand cycles and economic cycles. Rossell\u00f3 (2001) used the \nleading indicator approach to forecast the turning points of international visitor arrivals to \nthe Balearic Islands from the UK and Germany. The empirical results suggested that the \nleading indicator approach is favourable in turning point forecasting. Two studies further \nexamined the forecast accuracy in terms of directional change accuracy. Witt et al (2003) \nsuggested that the TVP model is preferable to 4 other econometric models and two time \nseries models in the short-run forecasting of directional change, but there is no clear-cut \nevidence when longer horizons are concerned. Petropoulos et al (2005) showed that the \nmodel which incorporates technical analysis techniques outperforms classic time series \nmodels in directional change forecasting competition. Future forecast accuracy evaluation \nstudies should not only focus on forecast error magnitude, but also on turning points and \ndirectional change errors.   \n \n4. Seasonality analysis \nOut of the 121 post-2000 studies 117 used historical data in modelling and forecasting \ntourism demand, within which 58 employed annual data, 30 used quarterly data, and \nanother 30 utilised monthly data (including 1 that uses both annual and monthly data). As \nan exception, Hu et al (2004) used 610 daily customer counts data to examine the short-\nterm demand for a casino buffet restaurant.  It can be seen that the main data frequency in \nthe existing literature is still annual data, consistent with earlier tourism forecasting \nstudies. However, in practice annual data cannot always meet the requirements of the \ndecision and policy makers in tourism , as in many situations they desire the prediction of \ntourism demand within the next 12 months in order for their short-term business planning \nor resource management (such as staffing and stock arrangement). The dominant use of \nannual data, mostly for econometric analysis, is probably due to the fact that the \nexplanatory variables at higher frequencies are not easy to obtain. Most existing papers in \nwhich monthly data are employed focus on time series methods where explanatory \nvariables are not needed. Amongst the 71 econometric studies, only 6 used monthly data. \nQuarterly data were used more frequently than the monthly data, but they have only been \nincluded in 18 studies. Other studies utilising monthly and quarterly data emphasised \nmainly the patterns of seasonal fluctuations in tourism demand.  \n \nSeasonality is a notable characteristic of tourism demand and cannot be ignored in the \nmodelling process when monthly or quarterly data are used. How to handle the seasonal \nfluctuations of tourism data has always been an important and complex issue in tourism \ndemand analysis. In the tourism demand forecasting literature, seasonality is often treated \n 19 \neither as a deterministic component or a stochastic component in the time series. If \nseasonality is considered as stochastic, the time series needs to be seasonally differenced \nto account for seasonal unit roots in the time series. If the seasonality is regarded as \ndeterministic, introducing seasonal dummies into the time series models would be \nsufficient in accounting for the seasonal variations. To test for the presence of seasonal \nunit roots, the HEGY test (Hylleberg, Engle, Granger, and Yoo, 1990) is widely used. \nHowever, empirical studies showed inconclusive evidence as to whether seasonality \nshould be treated as stochastic or deterministic, and whether imposing seasonal unit roots \nmay lead to more accurate forecasts. For instance, Alleyne (2006) applied the HEGY \nprocedure to detect stochastic seasonality of quarterly tourist arrivals to Jamaica and \nsuggested that forecast accuracy can be improved by pre-testing seasonal unit roots in the \ntime series. Lim and McAleer (2001b) concluded from their empirical study that it is \nmore appropriate to regard tourism demand seasonality as stochastic. However, using the \nsame unit root test, Kim and Ngo (2001) detected deterministic seasonality in their study \nof airline passenger flows between three Australian cities. Coshall (2005) presented \nmixed evidence in his empirical study of UK short-haul tourism demand by air and stated \nthat no generalisation could be made about the stochastic or deterministic nature of \nseasonality in the tourism demand data.  \n \nKim and Moosa (2001) further argued that the HEGY test suffers from deficiencies in \nsmall samples, which are often the case in the tourism context. As a result, incorrect \ninferential outcomes are likely to be obtained. This drawback of the HEGY test provides \nanother possible explanation for the above contradictory findings in addition to the \nlikelihood of different properties embodied in different datasets. Kulendran and Wong \n(2005) also challenged the power of the HEGY test in the model selection process.  Kim \nand Moosa (2001) proposed an alternative test to the HEGY test\u2014the Caner test, which \nalso generates contradictory results. According to the Caner test, stochastic seasonality is \nappropriate in most cases of their Australian tourist arrivals series. However, in a \nsubsequent forecasting comparison exercise, they found that the stochastic treatment of \nseasonality did not improve the forecast accuracy. The most accurate forecasts resulted \nfrom a regression based (time-series) model, in which seasonality was treated as a \ndeterministic component. Gustavsson and Nordstr\u00f6m (2001) also demonstrated that \nimposing unit roots on all frequencies could lead to more accurate short-term forecasts \nthan models built constitutionally on the outcome from seasonal unit root tests. These \nfindings responded to the statement by Clements and Hendry (1997) that \u201cthere is little \nevidence in the literature on the effect of imposing seasonal unit roots on forecast \naccuracy\u201d (cited from Gustavsson and Nordstr\u00f6m, 2001, p118). Therefore, Gustavsson \nand Nordstr\u00f6m (2001) suggested that rather than carrying out the unit root test, attention \nshould be paid to selecting a more flexible model structure (e.g., a state space model), \nthat can deal with such features as changing seasonal patterns and trends. \n \nUnlike the above traditional procedures of seasonal (integer) differencing of a time \nseries, Gil-Alana et al (2004) introduced an alternative method, known as the test for \nfractional integration, to test the seasonal components in the time series. The test \nemployed in their study allows for the consideration of unit and fractional orders of \nintegration in a time series. They found that the orders of integration are higher than 0 but \n 20 \nsmaller than 1 in the Spanish tourism demand series. This indicates that the tourism \ndemand series demonstrate seasonal long memory and mean reverting behaviour. The \npolicy implication of this is that \u201cthere exists less need for policy action since the series \nwill return to its path sometime in the future\u201d (Gil-Alana, 2005, p868). Furthermore, Gil-\nAlana (2005) examined seasonal fractional integration in monthly tourist arrivals to the \nUSA and reached a similar conclusion. In a forecasting comparison based on a longer \ndataset, this study further showed that the seasonal fractional models always outperform \nthe non-fractional ones. This finding raised a concern as to whether the SARIMA models \nused in the previous studies (supported by the HEGY test) actually reflected the \ncharacteristics of the seasonal-fractional integration in the time series. If they did not, all \nthe time series models specified in the previous studies suffered from the problem of \nmodel mis-specification. More empirical studies are needed to respond to this concern.  \n \nAnother approach to modelling seasonal fluctuations is to use the periodic \nautoregressive (PAR) model. This model allows for parameters to vary according to the \nseasons of a year, and therefore \u201cmay reflect seasonal economic decision making more \nadequately than constant parameter specifications\u201d (Osborn and Smith, 1989, pp126-127). \nRodrigues and Gouveia (2004) applied a parsimonious PAR model on a monthly series of \nlodging in the Algarve from several countries and demonstrated its superiority in \nforecasting performance to other PARs and an autoregressive model in first difference \nwith seasonal intercepts.  \n \n5. Events\u2019 impact analysis and risk forecasting \nMan made crises and natural disasters have affected international tourism demand \nconsiderably. Increasing attention has been paid to quantifying the effects of these \nexternal shocks on tourism demand using various forecasting techniques (e.g., Huang and \nMin, 2002; Eugenio-Martin et al, 2005). The general procedure for such post-event \nanalysis is to establish a reliable demand model, either a time series or an econometric \nmodel, using the historical data prior to the event, and then use this model to predict the \ntourism demand during the affected period. The predicted values are regarded as the level \nof tourism demand if the event would have not occurred. Thus, the differences between \nthe predicted and actual demand provide the estimates of the effects of the event. Huang \nand Min (2002) investigated the earthquake devastation and recovery in tourism in \nTaiwan, and Min (2005) examined the effect of SARS on tourism demand in Taiwan, \nwith both applying the SARIMA models. Eugenio-Martin et al (2005) used causal \nstructural time series models to qualify the effects of the September 11 terrorist attacks \nand the foot and mouth disease on the demand for Scottish tourism amongst American, \nFrench and German tourists. Law (2001) employed several forecasting techniques to \nstudy the impact of the Asian Financial Crisis on the demand for Hong Kong tourism by \nJapanese travellers. Goh and Law (2002) estimated the SARIMA and MARIMA models \nwith interventions to account for the influences of the Asian Financial Crisis along with \nother one-off events on Hong Kong inbound tourism. The limitation for such impact \nanalysis is that it is impossible to separate the effects of several crises if one takes place \nsoon after another. Likewise, Lim and McAleer (2002) employed the SARIMA models to \nanalyse the effects of the one-off events on the demand for Australian tourism by the \nAsian source markets. This type of analysis also represents a great challenge on model \n 21 \nspecification. The model\u2019s forecasting accuracy determines the precision of the impact \nanalysis.  \n \nConsidering the potential effects of crises, disasters and other one-off events, not only \nis post-event impact analysis necessary but also pre-event risk assessment is important. \nRisk forecasting is of great importance for tourism practitioners, such as tourism business \nexecutives and government offices that are involved in tourism. However, very little \nattention has been given to the latter. Prideaux et al (2003) argued that current forecasting \nmethods have little ability to cope with unexpected crises and disasters. Although these \nevents are unexpected, their occurrence may be associated with some level of certainty. \nThus, the effects of these events on tourism demand are to some extent predictable based \non appropriate scenario analysis.  Prideaux et al (2003) provided a useful framework for \nforecasting unexpected tourism shocks. In this framework shocks are classified according \nto severity, probability, type of event and level of certainty. Different forecasting tools, \nsuch as risk assessment, historical research, scenarios and the Delphi approach are \nsuggested to deal with different types of shocks in relation to the levels of uncertainty. In \nparticular, integration between qualitative and quantitative forecasting approaches was \nrecommended to produce a series of scenario forecasts based on different assumptions. \nEmpirical exercises of forecasting the unexpected tourism shocked based on this \nframework deserve future studies.  \n \n6. Data disaggregation and forecast accuracy \nMost published studies on tourism forecasting are based on aggregate data (total tourist \narrivals or total tourist expenditure) at the destination level. However, tourism demand \nanalysis at the disaggregate level (in terms of purpose of travel, country of origin, and so \non), is also of great interest to decision makers as it provides more detailed and diverse \ninformation than the total tourism demand. If the trends of individual market segments \nare major concerns, disaggregated data should be used in forecasting tourism demand. \nHowever, if the disaggregated data are available but forecasting the demand for aggregate \ntourism demand is of primary interest, the aggregate forecasts could be achieved through \ntwo methods. The first method is to forecast the total demand directly through \naggregation of the demand data; the second approach is to forecast each individual \ncomponent of the total market demand first and then to sum the individual forecasts (i.e., \nindirect forecasting) to arrive at the total aggregate forecasts (Song et al 2003c). This \nmethod is known as indirect forecast of total demand. Some attempts have been made to \nexamine the effect of data disaggregating on forecast accuracy in earlier studies (e.g., \nBlackwell, 1970 and Martin and Witt, 1989). Applying more advanced forecasting \ntechniques, some recent studies have further explored this issue. For instance, Kim and \nMoosa (2005) employed a SARIMA model, a regression-based time series model and a \nstructural time series model to compare the forecasting accuracy of direct and indirect \nforecasts using the data of tourist arrivals to Australia classified by the length of stay. All \nthree models suggested that the indirect method is favourable. However, in another study \nby Vu and Turner (2005), the opposite conclusion was drawn when the Holt-Winters \nmodel and basic structural time series model were used to forecast the Korean inbound \ntourist arrivals data disaggregated by purpose of travel, age and gender. Kon and Turner \n(2005) suggested that there is no statistical evidence to support either method.  \n 22 \n \n7. Conclusions  \nThis paper reviews 121 studies on tourism demand modelling and forecasting \npublished since 2000. The latest developments of quantitative forecasting techniques are \nsummarised in three categories: time series models, the econometric approach, and other \nemerging methods such as AI techniques. Although recent studies show that the newer \nand more advanced forecasting techniques tend to result in improved forecast accuracy \nunder certain circumstances, no clear-cut evidence shows that any one model can \nconsistently outperform other models in the forecasting competition. This conclusion \nconfirms those drawn in the pre-2000 studies. New attempts have been made recently to \nfurther enhance forecast accuracy through forecast combination, and forecast integration \nof quantitative and qualitative approaches. Further research in this respect is encouraged.  \n \nIn addition to forecast competition, there have been a few research areas in which \ninconclusive findings have been obtained. For example, seasonality has always been an \nemphasis of tourism demand analysis. However, there has been no clear-cut answer to the \nways in which the seasonality in tourism demand modelling and forecasting could be \nbetter handled. Seasonal fractional integration, which has been introduced in the tourism \ncontext very recently, is an alternative means to model seasonality. Moreover, mixed \nevidence has been presented in recent studies as to whether data disaggregation may \nimprove forecast accuracy.  Research in these areas deserves more attention by \nresearchers.  \n \nConsidering the enormous consequences of various crises and disasters, events\u2019 impact \nevaluation has attracted much interest in tourism demand forecasting research. It is \ncrucial for researchers to develop some forecasting methods that can accommodate \nunexpected events in predicting the potential impacts of these one-off events through \nscenario analysis. Other areas that have not been extensively researched include tourism \ncycle analysis, turning point and directional change forecasting. Greater attention has \nbeen put on forecasting the magnitude of tourism demand while limited research has been \nconducted in forecasting the directional change or turning point forecast accuracy. \nConsidering the significant policy implications of these forecasts, additional efforts need \nto be made in this research area in the future.  \n \n \nReferences \nAguil\u00f3, E., Riera, A., and Rossell\u00f3, J.
