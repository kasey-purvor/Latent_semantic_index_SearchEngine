There is some correlation of ENSO with both the SAM and NAM, with warm events being associated with weakening of the polar vortices. Strong volcanic aerosol signals are found with different signs in the two hemispheres. There is a clear solar influence on the NAO but no statistically significant signals of solar forcing are found in either the NAM or SAM. The QBO is not detected except, marginally, in the NAM in winter.

The different results for the NAO and surface NAM lead us to conclude, speculatively, that a (solar) stratospheric influence on the troposphere may well be through two different routes. The first of these is the influence of low latitude lower stratospheric heating on the Hadley circulation and mid-latitude eddies and thus on the NAO; the second is modulation, by a combination of solar and QBO forcing, of the polar stratosphere which influences the annular modes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. \\u","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Gebruder Borntraeger","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:nora.nerc.ac.uk:52<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2013-08-21T09:19:22Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      7374617475733D707562<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      7375626A656374733D5334<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      74797065733D61727469636C65<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:relation>\n    \n      \n        http:\/\/nora.nerc.ac.uk\/id\/eprint\/52\/<\/dc:relation><dc:title>\n        Solar influences on polar modes of variability<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Haigh,  Joanna D.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Roscoe,  Howard K.<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\n        Atmospheric Sciences<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\n        We present a multiple regression analysis of time series of the leading modes of variability in high latitudes, the Northern and Southern Annular Modes (NAM and SAM).
