Introduction\nThere has been considerable recent interest on clean air technologies for power\ngeneration for both stationary and mobile applications. A significant proportion of this\nhas concentrated on fuel cell technology [1], which has been known since the early\nnineteenth century but where the technology has matured into genuine applicability\nonly recently. For mobile applications, the emphasis has been placed on lower\ntemperature types (< 150\u00b0C) including hydrogen fuelled (overall reaction: H2 + O2 \u0001\nH2O) alkaline fuel cells (AFCs) and proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs),\nand the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) analogue of the latter (overall reaction:\nCH3OH + 3\/2O2 \u0001 CO2 + 2H2O) [2]. DMFCs are of primary interest in the field of\nmobile devices (e.g. laptop computers) due to ease and speed (instantaneous) of\nrefuelling and the large energy densities of the methanol fuel [3].\nThere is extensive worldwide research being conducted on replacement proton\nexchange membranes (PEMs) [4] and electrocatalysts for DMFCs [5]. The main\nproblems with current generation PEMs (such as Nafion\u00ae produced by DuPont) are\nhigh methanol permeabilities (from anode to cathode), which result in wasted fuel and\nlow power densities [6] and cost. The electrooxidation of methanol (6e- reaction) is\ninherently sluggish, which reduces performances further and leads to the requirement\nfor complex and expensive catalysts (e.g. Pt\/Ru). The interest in AFCs stems from the\nhigh power densities achievable with cheap and simple non-noble metal catalysts [7].\nHowever, AFCs have not been amenable to operation with methanol, as oxidation of\nmethanol produces CO2, which poisons the liquid alkaline electrolytes (normally\nKOH(aq)) by the formation of carbonate and hydrogen carbonate.\n3This study concerns the development of novel membranes for potential application in\nboth methanol and hydrogen fuelled cells, with direct applicability to low temperature\nDMFCs for portable devices. Strategic methodology involves a hybrid approach\ncombining the advantages (and complimentary behaviours) of DMFCs, PEMFCs and\nAFCs. This approach involves solid-state alkaline-form anion-exchange membranes\n(AAEMs). The use of AAEMs in DMFCs will allow reduction of the effects of\nmethanol permeabilities in a number of ways. The conduction pathway of the OH-\nions proceeds from the cathode to the anode (opposite to that of current fuel cells\ninvolving PEMs) and opposes the direction of methanol flux through the membrane\nleading to an intrinsic reduction in methanol transport. Electrocatalysis in alkaline\nmedia also allows the use of a wider range of catalysts, including cheaper non-noble\nmetals. This larger repertoire of catalysts should allow the selection of a cathode\ncatalyst that does not oxidise methanol, unlike current generation platinum cathode\ncatalysts, which will result in reduced overpotentials arising from methanol crossover.\nCheaper and simpler methanol oxidation catalysts would also be feasible for the\nanode.\nA significant proportion of previous fuel cell membrane research has examined the\nradiation-grafting of styrene onto polyethylene films, partially fluorinated films such\nas poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and poly(ethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene)\n(ETFE), and fully fluorinated poly(tetrafluoroethene-co-hexafluoropropylene) (FEP)\nfilms with subsequent sulfonation to yield cation-exchange sites [8-15], the properties\nand compositions of the final materials being easily controlled [8,12]. Such proton-\nexchange membranes have been tested in DMFC mode by Scott et al. [16]. Radiation-\ngrafted PVDF-based cation- and anion-exchange membranes have also been applied\n4to salt-splitting technologies [17-19]; that area would also benefit from this research.\nRadiation grafting methodology produces ionomer membranes cheaply and has major\nadvantages in that preformed commercial polymer films are modified, alleviating the\nneed for film formation steps, with a wealth of adjustable experimental parameters\n(e.g. radiation dose, temperature, film thickness) allowing a large degree of\ntailorability. It is essential that the effect of the reaction conditions on the membranes\nproduced is explored in detail for each polymer film \/ monomer combination [12],\nwhich is the basis of this study.\nThe grafting of vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC) onto FEP (FEP-g-PVBC) [20,21] with\nsubsequent amination with trimethylamine and ion-exchange with aqueous potassium\nhydroxide (FEP-g-PVBTMAOH, where VBTMAOH =\n(vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium hydroxide) yields alkaline, as opposed to acidic\n(proton-conducting), membranes (Scheme 1). Preliminary investigations on these\ntypes of AAEMs at Surrey [22,23] have demonstrated that PVDF-derived films are\nnot suitable for use in such membranes in alkaline form. This is because the PVDF\nbackbone was shown, by detailed Raman and solid-state NMR studies, to degrade\nwhen grafted, aminated and converted to the alkali form. However, these preliminary\nstudies demonstrated that this does not happen with fully fluorinated FEP-derived\nAAEMs, which retain structural integrity and ion exchange capacity (IEC), even\nwhen heated at 60\u00b0C for over 2500 h in water [23].\nThis article follows from our previous work and is concerned with the optimisation of\nthe experimental conditions required to maximise the levels of VBC grafting onto\nFEP preformed polymer films. A wide range of FEP-g-PVBC membranes are\n5reported (1 \u2013 17) and probed using thermogravimetry and Raman microscopy.\nSelected FEP-g-PVBC membranes (11, 12, and 17) were then aminated and ion-\nexchanged, to form AAEMs characterised in both the dry and hydrated forms.\n62. Experimental\n2.1. Chemical supply and pre-treatment\nTrimethylamine (Acros Organics, 45% aqueous solution) and toluene (Fisher,\nspecified reagent, low in sulfur) were used as received. Vinylbenzyl chloride (Dow\nChemicals, 97%, m\/p ratio of 1.30, stabilised with 75 ppm 4-t-butylcatechol and 733\nppm nitromethane, 192 ppm water) was stored in a refrigerator and used without\nfurther purification. FEP film (Goodfellow Ltd., U.K. 50 \u00b1 1 \u00b5m thickness) was used\nas received with no pre-wash in any solvent. The standard solutions used for IEC\ndetermination were used as received (Aldrich); the potassium hydroxide standards\nwere replaced with fresh solution regularly to reduce the build of carbonate and\nprevent inaccuracies in the titrations. Deionised water was used throughout this study.\n2.2. Polymer film irradiation\nThe FEP was irradiated with a \u0003-ray source (Royal Military College, Cranfield\nUniversity, Shrivenham, U.K) at a temperature of 23 \u00b1 1\u00b0C in air. The gamma\nradiation source consists of twenty rods of 60Co encapsulated in steel tubes in an open\ncylindrical arrangement. In the shielded position the source is housed in a lead and\nsteel flask incorporating a sliding shutter. The flask is located in a cell of internal\ndimensions 4 m x 3 m x 3 m. Typical source activity is 146 TBq, giving a maximum\ndose rate of 12.74 kGy h-1. The total doses for each grafted material are indicated in\nTable 1. The irradiated films were stored at -30\u00b0C in air. During this study, the\n7materials were used within 1 year of irradiation; radical stability under these storage\nconditions has been reported previously [8].\n2.3. Monomer Grafting to form FEP-g-PVBC membranes\nA general procedure for the grafting reaction is as follows. The exact reaction\nconditions for the synthesis of the FEP-g-PVBC membranes are given in Table 1. The\nFEP (known mass) was loosely rolled and immersed in excess vinylbenzyl chloride\n(or a 50%v\/v solution of VBC in toluene) in a cylindrical reaction vessel with a\nground glass tap; the VBC was then purged with nitrogen for 2 h at room temperature\nusing a long hollow needle before the tap was closed. The grafting reaction was\ncarried out at 40 - 70\u00b0C for known periods of time (days). The grafted membranes\nwere heated at 70\u00b0C in toluene overnight to remove any unbound poly(vinylbenzyl\nchloride) homopolymer and toluene from the membranes was then removed under\ndynamic vacuum (< 1 mmHg) for > 4 h. FEP-g-PVBC membranes (1 \u2013 17, Table 1)\nwere obtained as brittle translucent white films, where the degree of grafting (d.o.g.)\nof the materials were calculated as follows:\n100\u00d7\n\u0005\n=\ni\nig\nm\nmm\n.(%)g.o.d (1)\nwhere mg is the grafted mass and mi is the initial mass of the membranes.\n2.4. Amination of selected FEP-g-PVBC membranes to form FEP-g-\nPVBTMAOH membranes\n8Membrane 11 was immersed for 1, 2 and 7 days to establish optimum amination\ndurations (Section 3.3). Membranes 12 and 17 were immersed in a 45% aqueous\nsolution of trimethylamine for 48 h. After amination, the membranes were soaked in\ndeionised water for > 2 h (several changes of water) to remove any excess amine,\nboiled in water for 1 hour, soaked in water overnight, soaked in excess hydrochloric\nacid (aq, 1 mol dm-3) for > 48 h (to produce the chloride form), soaked in water for >\n48 h with several water changes, and finally stored in water to prevent dehydration.\nThe FEP-g-PVBTMAOH membranes 11N, 12N and 17N were generated by\nimmersion in a large excess of potassium hydroxide (aq, 1 mol dm-3) for 48 h\nfollowed by immersion in water for > 48 h, with frequent water changes to remove\nany trapped potassium hydroxide.\n2.5. Determination of ion-exchange capacities\nIon-exchange capacities (IECs) were determined as follows. The FEP-g-\nPVBTMAOH membranes were immersed in 20 cm3 of hydrochloric acid standard\n(aq, 0.1 mol dm-3) for 48 h. The solutions were then back titrated with potassium\nhydroxide standard (aq, 0.1 mol dm-3) using a Metrohm 716 DMS Titrino. The\ntitrations were conducted dynamically with a minimum addition of potassium\nhydroxide of 0.002 cm3 and a maximum titration rate of 0.5 cm3 min-1. Endpoints\nwere determined from maxima in the differential titration curves. Three replicates\nwere recorded for each membrane, and a blank run (20 cm3 of hydrochloric acid (aq,\n0.1 mol dm-3) with no membrane) was run alongside each batch to confirm the\nprecision and accuracy of the titrations. The amount of hydroxide anions in the\nmembrane was calculated from the difference between the initial amount of\n9hydrochloric acid in which the membranes were soaked and the amount of\nhydrochloric acid remaining (as determined from the titration). After titration the\nmembrane samples are washed in water, soaked in excess hydrochloric acid (aq, 1\nmol dm-3) for > 48 h to regenerate the chloride anion forms, soaked in water for > 48\nh with frequent changes to remove any trapped acid species, and dried under dynamic\nvacuum at 80\u00b0C (oven). The IECs reported were calculated as below:\n( ) ( )\n( )\u0005\n++\n\u0005 \u0005=\nClm\nHnHn\ngeqIEC\ndry\nfi1 (2)\nwhere ni(H+) is the amount of acid the membrane was soaked in, nf(H+) is the amount\nof acid remaining as determined by the titration, and mdry(Cl-) is the mass of the dried\nmembrane in the chloride-form.\n2.6. Water uptake experiments\nThe FEP-g-PVBTMAOH membranes \u201cas-synthesised\u201d (Section 2.4) were first\nweighed to determine the hydrated mass. The samples were then dried at RH = 0% (in\na desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride) for > 1 week at ambient temperature. It\nwas determined experimentally that this drying methodology gave the same level of\ndrying as treatment in a vacuum oven at 80\u00b0C for 4 hours; this low temperature\nmethod was adopted for this characterization as it avoids elevated temperatures,\nwhich might cause displacement of the trimethylamine functions by the hydroxide\nanions. The dried masses were recorded and the water uptake was calculated:\n( ) 100% \u00d7\u0005=\ndry\ndryhyd\nm\nmm\nWU (3)\nwhere mhyd is the hydrated mass and mdry is the dry mass. The water uptakes were\ncalculated (average for three membrane segments for each sample) for the hydrated\n10\nmembranes \u201cas synthesized\u201d and for the membranes after 3 dehydration \/ rehydration\n(soaked in water for 24 h) cycles.\n2.7. Membrane thicknesses (swelling)\nDuring water uptake experiments, the FEP-g-PVBTMAOH membrane thicknesses\nwere measured. These thicknesses (an average of 12 measurements across 3 of\nmembrane segments for each sample) were measured for the hydrated membranes \u201cas\nsynthesised\u201d and the membranes after initial dehydration, rehydration for the third\ntime, and after dehydration for the third time. The thicknesses were recorded using an\nexternal micrometer (estimated precision of \u00b13 \u00b5m).\n2.8. Thermogravimetry\nThermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG\/DTA) were carried out\nsimultaneously in flowing oxygen or nitrogen (60 cm3 min-1) using a Stanton Redcroft\nSTA-781 thermal analyser. Samples were heated from ambient temperature to 600\u00b0C\n(800\u00b0C for the samples analysed in nitrogen) at a heating rate of 2\u00b0C min-1 (unless\notherwise stated). All temperatures quoted in the text are sample temperatures\nmeasured with a Pt:Rh(13%) thermocouple in contact with the sample pan. Calcined\n\n-alumina was used as the reference material for DTA, with temperature calibrated\nfrom the endotherms arising from the melting of tin or zinc samples. Mass losses\narising from evaporation of water were accompanied by endotherms in the DTA\ntraces, while mass losses arising from decomposition of the polymers were\naccompanied by exotherms. All data were collected on an IBM-compatible computer\n11\nwith locally written software. The AAEMs were analysed in both the hydrated and\ndehydrated (RH = 0% for 1 week) states.\n2.9. Raman spectroscopy and microscopy\nRoutine Raman spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer System 2000 FT-Raman \/\nnear-IR spectrometer with a laser power of 1200 mW and a resolution of 4 cm-1.\nLiquid and membrane samples were mounted in the beam in glass vials at ambient\ntemperature and pressure.\nRaman microscopy was conducted on an Renishaw System 2000 microraman\nspectrometer with a Ga\/Al\/As laser (782 nm) generating 13 mW at the sample for the\nstudy of graft penetration. The spectra (resolution of 4 cm-1) were recorded with a\nspatial resolution of a circular area of radius 0.5 \u00b5m and a depth of 5 \u00b5m. The\nmembrane was pressed between two microscope slides and with the thin edge\nexposed. The spectra were recorded across the membrane thickness in steps of 2 \u00b5m.\n12\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Studies into the optimisation of the grafting conditions\nA series of FEP-g-PVBC membranes (1 \u2013 17) were synthesised with a variety of\nirradiation and grafting conditions (Table 1). Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the d.o.g\nobtained when one grafting parameter is varied at a time (grafting temperature,\ngrafting time, and monomer solution concentration respectively) with films irradiated\nat both 6.3 and 10 MRad total doses. It is immediately obvious that undiluted VBC,\nan irradiation total dose of 10 MRad, and a grafting temperature of 50\u00b0C yielded\nmembranes with the highest d.o.g; the rate of reaction of the radicals with the vinyl\nmonomer is clearly slow below 50\u00b0C, while at temperatures above 50\u00b0C the rate of\ntermination by radical combination reactions increases. This result agrees with that\nfound with the grafting of styrene onto ETFE (where the rate of grafting is higher\nwith increasing temperature, but the rate of radical termination also increases above\n50\u00b0C leading to lower actual saturation grafting levels [12]). Increased total dose\nleads to increased d.o.g. as expected. Total doses above 10 MRad for FEP lead to base\npolymer embrittlement, which is not desirable. The variation with grafting time is not\nclear-cut but 48 h appears sufficient (longer grafting times than this appear not to have\na significant effect on the level of grafting).\n3.2. Thermogravimetry of the FEP-g-PVBC membranes in oxygen\nOxygen was initially selected for the atmosphere required for thermogravimetry as\nthis would give the harshest regime for thermal analysis and also because oxygen is\n13\npresent in the operation of fuel cells (an intended application). The TG\/DTA trace of\nthe pre-irradiated FEP film in oxygen is shown in Figure 4. The decomposition in\noxygen of FEP commences at 403\u00b0C and proceeds rapidly in a two-stage process;\nexotherms were associated with both of these two stages. Less than 2% mass\nremained at 600\u00b0C. TGA\/DTA analysis was conducted on most of the FEP-g-PVBC\nmembranes synthesised (11 and 12 were required for amination studies and so were\nnot studied). A typical example is shown in Figure 5, which shows the combined TG\nand DTA data recorded with membrane 17, with the features of importance\nhighlighted. Particular points of interest for the FEP-g-PVBC membranes are the\ntemperature at which decomposition commences and the magnitude of the first mass\nloss; in membranes of higher d.o.g., this first mass loss appeared to proceed in two\nstages, but these are considered as one in the following discussion as the stages cannot\nbe resolved. The presence of two distinct degradation stages indicates the formation\nof FEP \/ poly(VBC) phase separated microdomains, similar to that previously\nreported for styrene grafted FEP materials [24].\nFor membrane 17 (28.9% d.o.g.), decomposition in oxygen commenced at 222\u00b0C (a\nsignificant drop in short-term stability in oxygen compared with FEP) and a first mass\nloss of 14.9% was observed. This first mass loss is much lower than the 28.9 %\nexpected if this mass loss was the complete loss of grafted hydrocarbon component.\nThis pattern was observed for all the FEP-g-PVBC membranes studied and suggests\nthat the decomposition of organic components overlap with the decomposition of the\nfluoropolymer backbones and also that a significant fraction of aromatic content\nremains at elevated temperatures [24,25]. The first mass loss was associated with two\nsmall exotherms (confirming this mass loss as a two stage process); the second mass\nDeleted: 4\n14\nloss (the largest with a magnitude of 82.9% and predominantly due to loss of the\nfluorocarbon backbone) appeared to proceed in a single stage and this is confirmed by\na single associated exotherm. With FEP-g-PVBC membranes of low d.o.g. (e.g. 15),\nthis second mass loss was larger in magnitude and approached the behaviour observed\nfor FEP i.e a two stage decomposition with two associated exotherms.\nThere was no evidence in the TG traces of any trapped unbound VBC in any of the\nmembranes, which would have manifested itself as low temperature mass losses with\nassociated endotherms in DTA traces (evaporation of the monomer). Figure 6 presents\nthe combined data from all the TG traces collected and shows the relationship\nbetween the magnitude of the first mass loss and the decomposition onset temperature\nwith respect to the degrees of grafting of the membranes. A spread of data was\nobserved, but linear relationships were apparent. This spread of data may originate\nfrom variations in morphology of the materials (i.e. the level mixing between the\nhydrocarbon graft domains and the FEP fluoropolymer rich domains may vary with\nthe grafting conditions). The lower the d.o.g. the lower is the magnitude of the first\nmass loss. There was also a small drop in apparent short-term thermal stability with\nincreasing d.o.g. (increasing hydrocarbon component). This may be an artefact of the\n\u201cobservability\u201d of the onset point for decomposition; the higher the graft loading, the\neasier decomposition is to spot. As previously reported by Scherer et al. [25] in the\nstudy of sulfonated styrene grafted FEP membranes, TG data do not give accurate\nindication of long-term thermal stabilities; the decomposition occurs slowly at lower\ntemperatures and this is easily masked by the relatively fast heating rates. Long-term\n(> 1 year) stability testing in water at 50\u00b0C (monitoring the IEC with time) is now\n15\nbeing conducted for 12N and will be reported in due course (so far after > 100 days, >\n87% of the original IEC remains).\n3.3 Raman spectroscopy of the FEP-g-PVBC membranes\nThe Raman spectrum of FEP (Figure 7) shows bands that have been previously\nobserved for PTFE [26]. The bands observed are (cm-1): 1381m \u000bs(C-C), 1300m \u000b(C-\nC), 1216w \u000b\ns(C-C), 734s \u000bs(CF2) with a shoulder at 752m which is not observed for\nPTFE, 598w \f(CF2), 579w \f(CF2), 387m \f(CF2), and 292m t(CF2).\nThe above FEP bands are all present in the Raman spectrum of 17N (Figure 7). New\nbands are observed, also present in the Raman spectrum of poly(vinylbenzyl\nchloride). The most significant of new bands are located at (cm-1): 1613s (aromatic\nring breathing), 1268s (CH2Cl), and 1002s (the \u000b12 band in the spectrum of\npoly(styrene) [27]). The absence of a band at 1632 cm-1 (the strong C=C band located\nin the Raman spectrum of VBC) confirms that no residual VBC monomer remains in\nthe membranes (corroborating TG data where no low temperature mass loss or\nendotherm assignable to evaporation of VBC was observed). The intensities of the\npoly(vinylbenzyl chloride) bands are directly related to the degree of grafting, with 17 \nexhibiting the most intense bands.\n3.4 The study of graft penetration using Raman microscopy\nRaman microscopy was used to measure the graft penetration of the VBC component\nwithin the thickness of the FEP base film, as has been previously reported for PFA-\n16\nstyrene radiation grafted systems [28,29] (PFA = poly(tetrafluoroethylene-co-\nperfluoropropylvinyl ether)). The intensity of the strong ring-breathing band of the\npoly(vinylbenzyl chloride) component at 1002 cm-1 compared to the intensity of the\nFEP band at 387 cm-1 was recorded at 2 \u00b5m steps across the thickness of selected\nFEP-g-PVBC membranes (Figure 8). These bands were selected as they were\ndetermined to be single bands which were well separated from nearby bands.\nInformation that was obtained from these data was: (a) the level of grafting from the\nmagnitude of the ratio of band intensities, and (b) the variation in grafting levels at\ndifferent positions within the membranes.\nFrom Figure 8 it can be seen that membrane 16 (with a low d.o.g. o= 6.4%) showed a\nsignificant drop of VBC component within the membrane interior compared with the\nedges. In contrast, membrane 17 with the highest d.o.g. obtained in this study of\n28.9% showed a reasonably high and uniform level of VBC component throughout\nthe thickness of the membrane. Figure 8 clearly shows that the amount of VBC\ncomponent within the membrane increases with an increasing d.o.g. for each of the\nmembranes studied. The cross section is quite \u201cnoisy\u201d, indicating some fluctuations in\nthe amount of each component throughout the membrane thickness; this is consistent\nwith previously proposed microdomains [24]. For some of the membranes, there is a\nsudden increase in the level of VBC component at the membrane surfaces; this\nindicates surface-grafted VBC homopolymer.\n3.5. Amination of 11 for optimisation of amination times\n17\nMembrane 11 was aminated and ion-exchanged to form the AAEM 11N for the\npurpose of studying the effect of amination time on the IECs of the membranes\nproduced. Amination times of 1, 2 and 7 days were studied. It was evident that\namination times > 1 day made very little difference on the IECs: IEC(1 day) = 0.99\nmeq g-1, IEC(2 day) = 1.00 meq g-1, and IEC(7 day) = 0.96 meq g-1 (arithmetic mean\n= 0.98 \u00b5m, standard deviation 0.02 \u00b5m). Amination times of 48 h were used for\nsubsequent amination reactions.\n3.6. Ion-exchange capacities (IECs) of 11N, 12N and 17N AAEMs\nThe IECs increase with increasing degree of grafting as expected (Table 2); the\nhighest exchange capacity obtained was 1.08 meg g-1 for 17N, which is higher than\nthat found with the Nafion\u00ae-11x series of membranes (0.92 meq g-1). The values\ndetermined by titration (Table 2) were lower than the maximum theoretical values that\nwere calculated when assuming 100% amination, 100% water removal on drying, and\nno side-reactions (the experimental values were between 65 \u2013 80% of the calculated\nvalues). This indicates: (a) displacement of a minor number of NMe3 groups on\ntreatment with potassium hydroxide (1 mol dm-3), or (b) incomplete amination, or (c)\nincomplete dehydration. Raman spectroscopic investigations (Section 3.9) confirm\ncomplete amination and (b) above can be discounted. The TG of dried 17N in the\nchloride form (post titration) showed that 5% of the mass was due to water, hence, the\ncorrected IEC would be 1.14 meq g-1 for a dried membrane containing no traces of\nwater.\nDeleted: ton\n18\n3.7 Water uptake and variation in thickness of 12N and 17N\nThe water uptakes \u201cas-synthesised\u201d and after 3 dehydration \/ rehydration cycles for\n12N and 17N show that the membranes with higher degrees of grafting (and IEC)\nabsorbed more water (as expected). The water uptakes were higher initially as the\nsynthesis of the AAEMs involved boiling step (after treatment in trimethylamine)\nwhich would have expanded the membrane to the maximum extent; the dehydration \/\nrehydration cycles (in the alkaline form) involved no such process, as hydration\nconsisted of immersion in water for 24 h.\n17N also showed slightly increased thicknesses compared with 12N, as expected and\nfor both hydration states (Table 2). The thicknesses of both hydrated membranes were\nlarger \u201cas-synthesised\u201d (Section 2.4) than after the dehydration \/ rehydration cycles,\nmirroring water uptake observations. However, the thickness of dehydrated 17N after\nthe dehydration \/ rehydration cycles was larger than when the thickness was measured\nafter initial dehydration; this was not expected and may indicate that repeated\ndehydration \/ rehydration affects the morphology of the AAEMs. The thickness of\n17N after initial dehydration (62 \u00b5m) was also observed to be smaller than the\nthickness of the pre-aminated grafted membrane 17 (65 \u00b5m); if anything a small\nincrease in thickness had been expected with the introduction of bulkier\ntrimethylammonium hydroxide groups replacing the chloride atoms of the\nbenzylchloride functions in 17. The above observations on thicknesses, however,\nmust be considered in perspective; the difference in thicknesses between 12N and\n17N in the same hydration state was sometimes within the resolution window (\u00b1 3\n\u00b5m). Also, from the standard deviations it can be seen that there was a spread of\n19\nthicknesses for each AAEM in each hydration state, which suggests some variation of\nthe level of grafting across the area of each membrane.\n3.8 Thermogravimetry of the AAEMs 12N and 17N\nThe TG\/DTA curves of AAEMs 12N and 17N were recorded in oxygen for both the\nhydrated and dry (RH = 0% for 1 week) states (Table 3); the heating rate for the\naminated samples was changed to 5\u00b0C min-1 (dpm) to allow the data for the hydrated\nand dehydrated samples for each material to be collected on the same day. The TG\ncurves recorded in oxygen for FEP, 17 and 17N (hydrated and dry states) are\npresented in Figure 9 to aid visualisation of the discussions below.\nAn initial mass loss (30 \u2013 164\u00b0C, associated endotherm) was observed with the\nAAEMs in both hydration states and corresponds to loss of water. This initial mass\nloss was larger for both of the hydrated AAEMs compared to the dehydrated AAEMs\nas expected; however the magnitude of these initial mass losses (31.2% and 30.2% for\nhydrated 12N and 17N respectively) were much lower than the corresponding water\nuptakes (Section 3.7, Table 2). Therefore, some loss of water must either overlap with\n(or mechanistically contribute to) material decomposition, resulting in complications\nin the quantitative analysis.\nWater loss was also evident on heating dehydrated 12N and 17N (the corresponding\ninitial mass losses in the range 30 - 154\u00b0C were 4.0% and 6.8% respectively). This\nindicates drying at RH = 0% (in a desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride) for 1\nweek does not remove all of the water content for the AAEMs. This was anticipated,\nDeleted: The TG study of these\nmaterials was repeated in nitrogen; the\nuse of an inert atmosphere could delay\nthe onset of material decomposition\n(resulting in improved resolution between\nthis and loss of water content) but this\nwas not the case (Table 3, Figure 10).\n20\nas the OH- ions would form strong hydrogen bonds to water resulting in a strongly\nbound hydration sphere. The material with the larger IEC retained the most water on\ndehydration, as expected.\nA second mass loss occurs at begins at 151 \u2013 165\u00b0C (Table 3) for both 12N and 17N\nin all humidity states in oxygen (with associated exotherms). This mass loss is due to\nthe onset of polymer degradation through the loss of amine species; the state of\nhydration or the original degree of grafting does not significantly affect the inherent\nshort-term stability of the AAEMs. All further higher temperature mass losses\nobserved relate directly to the mass losses observed for the degradation of pre-\naminated grafted FEP-g-PVCBC membranes (Section 3.2).\nThe TG study of these materials was repeated in nitrogen; the use of an inert\natmosphere could delay the onset of material decomposition (resulting in improved\nresolution between this and loss of water content) but this was not the case (Table 3,\nFigure 10).\n3.9 Raman spectroscopy of FEP-g-PVBTMAOH AAEMs\nThe Raman spectra of 17N (wet and dry) and vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium\nchloride for comparison are shown in Figure 7. The bands at 1267s (CH2Cl), 1185m,\n834m, 712m, 700m, and 683m cm-1 that were present in the Raman spectrum of 17\ndisappear on amination to 17N; the lack of these bands indicates complete amination.\nNew bands at 1454m, 1064w, 978w, 893w, and 754m cm-1 are observed; these bands\nare also present in the Raman spectrum of vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride.\nDeleted: 15N\n21\nThere was very little difference between the spectra of dry and wet 17N with only a\nsmall decrease in the signal to noise ratio for the wet sample.\nIn Section 3.6 the lower than expected IECs may have arisen from displacement of\nthe ammonium groups by the OH- ions required for conversion to the alkaline-form\nAEM. This would lead to CH2OH groups attached to the aromatic rings. The Raman\nspectrum of vinylbenzyl alcohol (not shown) contains bands at 1310m, 1180m, and\n827m cm-1 that are not present in the Raman spectra of vinylbenzyl chloride and\nvinylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride. These bands are also not observed in\nRaman spectra of dry 17N; this nucleophillic displacement of amine by hydroxide\nions is minimal and will in future allow the IECs of the anion-exchange membranes to\nbe measured directly for the alkaline, as opposed to the chloride, forms. OH- has a\nmolecular mass (17.0 g mol-1) that is lower than Cl- (35.5 g mol-1), and hence the\nIECs of hydroxide-form membranes will be higher than the analogous chloride forms\n(e.g. for membrane 11N, the theoretical maximum value for the IEC of the hydroxide\nform is 1.32 meq g-1 while the calculated IEC for the chloride form is 1.22 meq g-1);\nthis means that the IECs reported in this study are lower than the true IECs of the\nAAEMs synthesised.\n3.10 Preliminary conductivity measurements\nTwo probe impedance spectroscopy on membranes 12N and 17N (recorded on a\nSolartron 1260 Frequency Response Analyser \/ 1287 Electrochemical Interface\ncombination with frequencies between 1 Hz and 1 MHz and a 10 mV a.c. voltage\namplitude and using the method which has been previously reported [23]) gave proton\nDeleted: n\nDeleted: This\n22\nconductivities of around 0.01 S cm-1 for both membranes. This is a satisfactory order\nof magnitude for application in fuel cells.\nFormatted\n23\n4. Conclusions\nThe following conclusions relate to use of 50 \u00b1 1 \u00b5m thick poly(hexafluoropropylene-\nco-tetrafluoroethylene) polymer (FEP, Goodfellow) as a precursor film and the\nmonomer vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC, Dow Chemicals). Trimethylamine (aq,\n45%mass) and KOH (aq, 1 mol dm-3) were used for conversion to alkaline anion-\nexchange membranes.\n(1) Vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC) can been successfully pre-irradiation grafted onto\nFEP to yield FEP-g-PVBC membranes (1 \u2013 17) with degrees of grafting in the\nrange of 3.3 \u2013 28.9%.\n(2) Optimum grafting conditions (for maximum degrees of grafting) were\ndetermined as irradiated film immersion in undiluted VBC at 50\u00b0C for 48\nhours. Higher irradiation total doses give higher degrees of grafting.\n(3) The short-term thermal stabilities of the FEP-g-PVBC membranes (determined\nby thermogravimetry) reduce slightly with increasing levels of grafting.\n(4) The graft penetration improved with increasing degree of grafting. There is no\nevidence of any trapped and unbound VBC in the grafted materials.\n(6) Selected FEP-g-PVBC membranes were successfully aminated with\ntrimethylamine and ion-exchanged with aqueous potassium hydroxide to give\nbenzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide alkaline anion-exchange membranes\n(11N, 12N, and 17N).\n(7) Optimisation studies indicate that amination times of 48 h at room temperature\nare adequate.\n(8) The ion-exchange capacities, water uptakes, and membrane swelling\n(thickness) generally increase with increasing d.o.g.\n24\n(9) Thermogravimetry of alkaline anion-exchange membranes of this type is not\nsufficient for determination of water uptakes.\n(10) The onset of degradation of the final alkaline anion-exchange membranes does\nnot depend on the degree of grafting or the membrane humidity.\n(11) Raman spectroscopic studies confirm complete amination of the FEP-g-PVBC\nmembranes with minimal nucleophillic displacement of amine by the OH- ions\nin the ion-exchange reaction.\nThe AAEMs produced in this study are currently being evaluated in a direct methanol\nfuel cell; the performance curves (along with data on in-situ membrane resistivities\nand stabilities) will be reported at a later date.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors gratefully thank Keith Lovell of the Royal Military College Shrivenham,\nCranfield University for the irradiation of the FEP films and for useful discussions.\nReferences\n1 H.
