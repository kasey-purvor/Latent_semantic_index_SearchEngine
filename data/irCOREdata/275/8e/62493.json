Organic nitrogen compounds also \ninfluence atmospheric chemistry and air quality (Nakamura et al., 2006) and, in water \ntreatment, DON compounds are an emerging concern as precursors for carcinogenic \ndisinfection byproducts such as haloacetonitriles and N-nitrosodimethylamine (Ambonguilat \net al., 2006, Lee and Westerhoff, 2005, Westerhoff and Mash, 2002).\nOne of the main limitations in DON determination in water samples is that it is not possible to \nquantify directly (Cape et al., 2001, Jones and Willett, 2006, Vandenbruwane et al., 2007, \nZhang et al., 2008). DON concentration is calculated by the subtraction of several \nindependently measured concentrations, which leads to an important analytical uncertainty \n(Lee and Westerhoff, 2005, Vandenbruwane et al., 2007). For this reason, and other \ndifficulties associated with organic nitrogen species analysis, most of the studies regarding N \nbudgets to date have been conducted only on the inorganic nitrogen species. In Europe, the \nreactive nitrogen compounds restricted under the Gothenburg Protocol (UN-ECE, 1999) and \nthe EU Directive 2001\/81\/EC (EU, 2001), both aiming to limit emissions of acidifying and \neutrophying pollutants and ozone precursors, only include nitrogen oxides (NOx) and \nammonia (NH3) and their roles as precursors of inorganic N deposition in precipitation. \nHowever, atmospheric DON deposition has been estimated to represent on average 30% of \nthe total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in precipitation in the UK (Cape et al., 2004) and varying \nproportions (both higher and lower) elsewhere (Cornell et al., 1995, Cornell and Jickells, \n1999, Cornell et al., 2003, Neff et al., 2002).\nThe atmospheric organic nitrogen fraction is believed to include a large spectrum of natural \ncompounds such as amino acids and urea, and small amounts of synthetic compounds such as \natrazine (Ambonguilat et al., 2006), or reaction products from man-made emissions, such as \nnitrophenols (Luttke et al., 1997),  but in spite of the importance of ON in the global N \nbudget, the chemical forms and sources of ON are not yet sufficiently understood. \nAn important and yet unanswered question is the atmospheric ON origin: natural, \nanthropogenic or mixed? Due to the important contribution of the ON fraction to the total N \nbudget, this is a key question when assessing the scale of the human perturbation of the N \ncycle. To date, investigations of individual compounds and isotopic analysis have been unable \nto provide conclusive results regarding the origin of atmospheric ON (Kelly et al., 2005). In a \nrecent study over the East China Sea and western North Pacific it was suggested that water \nsoluble organic nitrogen (WSON) compounds in marine aerosols were mainly from \nanthropogenic origin, as they were associated with continental materials of anthropogenic \norigin, particularly NH4+ in fine particles (Nakamura et al., 2006). On the other hand, another \nstudy (Pacheco et al., 2004) claimed that WSON represents up to 90% of the total soluble \nnitrogen found in tropical continental rain in remote unpolluted sites, suggesting a natural \norigin.\nAnother crucial question is whether the main contributor to the ON fraction in terrestrial \necosystems is dry or wet deposition. Wet deposition denotes removal by clouds and falling \nprecipitation, and dry deposition denotes the direct collection of gases and particulates on a \n2\nPublished in Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 4087\u20134094\nsurface. In this context, a number of methods and different designs have been described for \nrain sampling over the last 30 years (D\u00e4mmgen et al., 2005). However, despite several studies \nshowing that dry deposition can contribute significantly to nitrogen in bulk precipitation \n(Cape and Leith, 2002), in many cases, precipitation composition is derived from \nmeasurements of bulk precipitation, i.e. the basic design comprises a funnel connected to a \ncollecting bottle, and therefore does not discriminate between dry deposition to the surface of \nthe funnel and nitrogen species dissolved in the rain. There have been many studies aimed at \nevaluating the contribution of dry deposition to bulk precipitation collectors (Cape et al., \n2009, Lee and Longhurst, 1992) but none so far has explicitly considered the effect on water-\nsoluble organic nitrogen.\nIn summary, very little is known with regard to organic nitrogen in the atmosphere and in \nprecipitation, and to its source and sink budgets. To date very important questions such as \ndeposition mechanisms remain unanswered: wet vs. dry deposition; natural, anthropogenic or \nmixed origin; composition and biological availability. The aim of the work presented in this \npaper is to measure the organic nitrogen fraction dissolved in precipitation, and to \ndiscriminate between what is coming from dry and wet deposition.\nExperimental\nStudy site and collection methods\nPrecipitation was sampled weekly from June 2005 to April 2007 at the Centre for Ecology \nand Hydrology, in a \u2018science park\u2019 and within 1 km of mixed farming (arable and dairy) 15 \nkm southwest of Edinburgh, UK (N55\u00b051\u203244\u2033, W3\u00b012\u203219\u2033). Two types of rain collector were \nused in this study: standard rain collectors and flushing rain collectors. Three rain collectors \nof each type were mounted 1.5 m above ground, in a 5 m-side square, in the middle of a grass \nfield. The standard rain collectors consisted of a polypropylene funnel diameter 152 mm \nmounted directly in a polypropylene collecting bottle, and is the design used in the UK \nnational network for monitoring precipitation composition (Cape et al., 2001). The flushing \nrain collectors (Cape et al., 2009) are equipped with a rain detector (conductivity array), a \nspray nozzle, an identical polypropylene funnel to the standard collector, a 2-way PTFE \nmotorized valve, and two independent collecting bottles at ground level, connected to the \nfunnels by 1.5m lengths of silicone tubing enclosed in an opaque flexible PVC tube (to \nexclude light and minimise biological activity). When a rain event is detected, the funnel is \nrinsed with a fixed volume of 10% methanol in distilled water and the washings are collected \nin one of the sampling bottles as a measure of dry deposition on the funnel surface since the \nlast precipitation event. One minute after the rinsing, the 2-way valve is switched to allow the \nsubsequent rain, free from any contamination by prior dry deposition, to enter the second rain \nsample bottle. At the end of a rain event, signalled by the rain detector, the valve is switched \nagain to the 'divert' position to seal the rain sample bottle from the atmosphere.\nSample Preservation\nNitrogen containing compounds in precipitation are especially vulnerable to biological \ndegradation (Cape et al., 2001, Hadi and Cape, 1995). For this reason there is a need for \npreservation of the sample during the processes of collection, transportation and storage. In \nthis study, a small amount of a biocide solution was added to the collection bottles prior to \n3\nPublished in Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 4087\u20134094\nsampling. Thymol (2-isopropyl-5-methyl phenol) was the biocide of choice in this study, as it \nis non-volatile, effective at low concentrations, and presents few toxicity problems for \ndisposal. 100 mg L-1 was previously determined to be the optimum concentration (Cape et \nal., 2001, Hadi and Cape, 1995). This was the target concentration when sample bottles for \nrainfall and washings were charged with 25 mg thymol per litre of capacity before use (1 mL \nand 0.5 mL of 50 g L-1 methanol solution for rain and washings, respectively). The final \nthymol concentration in each sample was therefore variable, depending on the amount of rain \nduring each particular week. However, the biocidal effect is not diminished greatly even if the \nsample bottle is filled (Cape et al., 2001). Collected rain samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C before \nanalysis. Samples were filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m pore-size inorganic membrane filter \n(Whatman, Anotop 10 IC) before chemical analysis.\nDetection Techniques & Instrumentation\nDissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations in water samples cannot be quantified \ndirectly. Analysis involves several steps: determination of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) \nconcentration, determination of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen species (DIN) concentration, \nand finally subtraction of DIN concentrations from the TDN concentrations. TDN includes all \nnitrogen containing species (organic and inorganic) dissolved in the sample. DIN includes all \nthe nitrates (NO3-), nitrites (NO2-) and ammonium (NH4+) dissolved in the sample.\nTotal Dissolved Nitrogen (TDN) Determination Methods\nTDN determination requires a preparatory digestion step, either chemical or by combustion. \nThe main digestion methods available and in current use for total nitrogen determination in \naqueous samples are: Kjeldahl digestion (Doval et al., 1997, Nozawa et al., 2005, Yasuhara \nand Nokihara, 2001), alkaline persulphate oxidation (Cape et al., 2001, Cornell et al., 2003, \nScudlark et al., 1998) and high-temperature catalytic oxidation (Cape et al., 2001, Cornell et \nal., 2003, Keene et al., 2002).\nHigh-temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO) was the method of choice in this study. This \nmethod aims for the complete combustion of all organic material to CO2 and nitric oxide \n(NO), followed by quantitative detection of nitric oxide (NO) by chemiluminescence. The \ninstrument used for this technique was a Nitrogen Specific HPLC Detector, ANTEK 8060-M, \noperated according to the manual. The analysis was conducted in flow-injection mode, with \ntriplicate analysis of a 20 \u00b5L sample in a carrier of deionised water at a flow rate of 250 \u00b5L \nmin-1. Typical detection limit for TDN was 1 \u00b5M N, based on independent calibration with \nstandard solutions of ammonium sulphate and sodium nitrate. Prior tests had shown that the \nANTEK system converts all but the most intransigent organic compounds quantitatively \n(Cape et al., 2001).\nDissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) Determination Methods\nIon chromatography was the method of choice for dissolved inorganic nitrogen determination. \nThe equipment used included a Metrohm 766 IC Sample Processor connected in parallel to a \nMetrohm 733 IC Separation Centre equipped with a Metrosep C1 column for ammonium \ndetermination, using 24 mM boric acid \/ 5 mM tartaric acid \/ 0.7 mM dipicolinic acid eluent, \nand to a Metrohm 761 Compact IC equipped with a Metrosep A Supp 5 column, with 3.2 mM \ncarbonate \/ 1.0 mM bicarbonate as eluant, for nitrate and nitrite determination. Typical \ndetection limits were 0.5 \u00b5M for NH4+ and 0.4 \u00b5M for NO3- for a 250 \u00b5L injection. The cation \n4\nPublished in Atmospheric Environment 43 (2009) 4087\u20134094\nanalysis also quantified potassium concentrations in the sample, used to identify potential \ncontamination (see below)\nLimit of detection for DON\nThe limit of detection for the individual analytes (above) was defined as 3 times the SD of the \nblanks. The variance of DON is defined as the summation of the variance of the 3 \nindependent measured concentrations (TDN, NH4+ & NO3-). Therefore, the limit of \ndetection of DON would be 1.2 \u00b5M N. However, samples with DON under this limit of \ndetection, and even with small negative values, have been included in the statistical analysis, \nas to have discarded an otherwise valid sample only on the grounds of low or negative DON \nconcentration would have biased the statistical analysis towards the samples with higher DON \nconcentrations.\nCriteria used to establish sample quality\nTwo criteria were used to identify valid precipitation samples: (i) free from obvious \ncontamination: K+ concentration must be lower than 20 \u00b5M, as K+ is a good marker for \nbiological contamination (in this study, normally due to bird droppings). 6% of the samples \ncollected were discarded for this reason. (ii) The sample must have sufficient amount of \nrainfall: the minimum volume was set at 50 mL. Samples with lower volumes were discarded, \nas they are more vulnerable to alterations in original composition, mainly due to evaporation \nor condensation processes. 7.5% of the samples collected were discarded for this reason.\nThe sampling period comprised 92 weeks, from 17th June 2005 to 28th March 2007. For \nstatistical analyses only those weeks with three valid collector replicates for each type of \ncollector were included, limiting the set of samples to 41 weeks. Weeks with three valid \nsamples but with relative standard deviation (RSD) in the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) \ngreater than 50%, either in bulk deposition or in (dry + wet) deposition, were regarded as \n\u201csuspicious\u201d and removed from the statistical analysis, as the important discrepancies \nobserved in those weeks within collectors of the same type (either standard rain gauges or \nflushing rain gauges) might suggest that an unnoticed problem had occurred in one or more of \nthe collectors during that particular period. Seven of the 41 remaining weeks were discarded \nfor this reason. Two additional weeks were removed from the statistical analysis, as mineral \nnitrogen fertilizer was being applied to a nearby field on these dates.\nResults\nDissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON)\nDissolved organic nitrogen (DON) represents a significant fraction of the N-containing \nspecies in all types of rain gauge (bulk, washings and wet deposition) over the whole period \nof study.

However, 6th July 2006 is the only date in \nthe whole period for which TDN in wet deposition was significantly higher than in \ndry deposition.\nTable 1 presents the average amount of TDN and DON deposited in each type of \ncollector, the average DON % relative to TDN, the average concentration of TDN and \nDON in rain, and the average volume of sample collected, either from rain (in bulk \nand wet deposition), or from washings (as dry deposition). The table is split into 2 \nparts: the first includes weeks with 3 valid replicates for at least one type of collector \n(38, 35 and 56 weekly samples for bulk, wet deposition and washings, respectively). \nThe second part includes the 27 weekly samples with 3 valid replicates for all the 3 \ntypes of samples (bulk, wet deposition and washings). In this table, the standard \ndeviation corresponding to the average amount deposited in the collector, the average \nsample volume, and the average concentration in rain is referred to the differences \nbetween independent collectors of the same type. The standard deviation for the DON \n% relative to TDN, on the other hand, is referred to the differences in the average \ndeposition between the weeks included in that period. It has been presented in this \nway so the reader can have a grasp of the magnitude of deposition variability between \nweeks.\n9\nIn theory,  the addition of the washings and wet deposition together  should be the \nsame as bulk deposition. The large discrepancies found between bulk deposition and \n(wet + dry) deposition for N-containing solutes, but not other solutes (Cape et al., \n2009), will be discussed in the section \u201cStandard versus Flushing rain gauges\u201d.\nIn a significant number of weeks, large differences were found between independent \nreplicate samples, for both types of sampler, particularly for the wet deposition \ncollectors. In most cases, the largest relative uncertainty in the DON: TDN ratio is \ncaused by low concentrations of nitrogen species in the sample, and the combined \nuncertainties associated with each of the species involved in the calculation of DON. \nThe low concentration of TDN in wet deposition, compared to bulk deposition, is \ndiscussed below.\nDry Deposition versus Wet Deposition\nIn most of the samples, the dry deposition fraction (funnel washings) of water soluble \nN-containing species (both organic and inorganic) is significantly larger than the wet \ndeposition fraction. The weekly TDN deposition data (absolute amount, in \u00b5moles N \nm-2 week-1) from wet and dry deposition to the flushing gauge is represented in Figure \n7. For comparison purposes, only the 49 weeks with 3 valid replicates for (dry + wet) \ndeposition have been included (RSD <50% for sum of wet + dry deposition within \nreplicates).\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\n1800\n28\/05\/2005 25\/09\/2005 23\/01\/2006 23\/05\/2006 20\/09\/2006 18\/01\/2007\n\u00b5m\nol\nes\n N\n m\n-2\n w\nk-\n1\nTDN-Wet Deposition TDN-Dry Deposition\nFigure 7: Weekly wet and dry deposition of TDN in \u00b5moles N m-2 to the flushing \nsamplers.

Figure 2).\n10\nResults from two-way ANOVA statistical analysis for this set of data, after a Box-\nCox transformation (power 0.6) was applied to the data (which were approximately \nlog-normally distributed) in order to fulfil the assumptions of the model, showed \nhighly significant (P<0.001) effects of sample date and sample type (wet or dry). \nThe main source of variation corresponds to the variation between the two types of \nsample from the flushing rain gauges (dry and wet deposition). This effect is even \nlarger than the one corresponding to sample date, which was expected to be very \nlarge. These results are in good agreement with the consistent differences between dry \nand wet deposition observed in figure 7. The interaction term in the ANOVA was also \nsignificant (P<0.001), but in only one week, out of 49 weeks with 3 valid replicates, \nwas the amount of TDN collected from wet deposition clearly larger than from dry \ndeposition.\nStandard versus Flushing rain gauges \nWashing mechanism off: 15-week period (from 10\/03\/06 to 15\/06\/2006)\nFor a period of 15 weeks (from 10\/03\/06 to 15\/06\/2006) the flushing-washing \nmechanism of the flushing rain gauges was turned off, leaving the PTFE valve open \nto the rain collector. Data from this period allows direct comparison of bulk \ndeposition between the standard rain gauges and the flushing rain gauges. For \ncomparison purposes and statistical analysis, only 5 weeks out of the 15-week period \nhad 3 valid replicates for both types of rain gauge. Bulk weekly TDN deposition \n(\u03bcmoles N m-2 wk-1) in standard and (non-operating) flushing rain gauges is \nrepresented in Figure 8. \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n09\/03\/2006 19\/03\/2006 29\/03\/2006 08\/04\/2006\n\u00b5m\nol\nes\n N\n m\n-2\n w\nk-\n1\nTDN-Standard Rain Gauges TDN-Flushing Rain Gauges\nFigure 8: Weekly bulk deposition of TDN in \u00b5moles N m-2 in standard and \u2018non-\noperating\u2019 flushing rain gauges. Error bar shows standard deviation of 3 \nreplicate samplers.\n11\nFigure 8 clearly illustrates that the amount of TDN collected in all the 5 weeks with 3 \nvalid replicates was larger in the standard rain gauges than in the flushing rain gauges, \nas confirmed by two-way ANOVA, with P<0.001 for both main effects of date and \ngauge type.  This was an unexpected outcome, as the prior expectation is that both \ntypes of rain gauge (standard and flushing) should behave exactly the same when the \nflushing-washing mechanism was not in operation.\nInitially, evaporation losses in standard rain gauges were contemplated as a plausible \nexplanation for the discrepancies between standard rain gauges and flushing rain \ngauges. Such losses would explain the larger overall concentration of N species in \nstandard rain gauges, as well as the lower concentrations of organic nitrogen species \n(see below - \u201cDON production in flushing rain gauges\u201d), which might include an \nimportant fraction of volatile compounds that would be lost along with water in the \ncase of evaporation. However, this hypothesis was disproved by the experimental \nevidence, as no significant differences were observed between the rainfall amount \nbetween standard and flushing rain collectors (differences < 5%) or the concentrations \nof other solutes such as sodium, calcium, chloride and sulphate (Cape et al., 2009).\nAfter discarding losses due to evaporation as an explanation, the most likely reason \nfor the different behaviour of the two types of collector is losses of N-species along \nthe 1.5 m long silicone tubing which connects the funnel to the rain collector in the \nflushing rain gauges, but not in the standard gauge, in which the funnel is connected \ndirectly to the sample bottle. Losses could either be due to biological activity in the \ntubing, which is a thymol-free area, despite being kept dark, or due to ion exchange \nprocesses between the sample and the silicone walls of the tubing. The extent of this \neffect is expected to be quite variable, as it would be strongly influenced by a number \nof factors such as temperature and rain volume. This loss of N during the sampling \nprocess has implications for estimating the relative importance of dry and wet \ndeposition, as discussed below.\nWashing mechanism on\nFlushing rain gauges were performing as designed, i.e. discriminating between dry \nand wet deposition, for a period of 77 weeks. Figure 9 represents the total amount of \nTDN collected in standard rain gauges and in flushing rain gauges (washings + rain) \neach week. Only the 27 weeks with 3 valid replicates in each type of collector are \nincluded in the plot and in the statistical analysis.\nIn this period of \u201cwashings on\u201d, there was also a tendency for a larger amount of N-\ncontaining species to be collected in standard rain gauges than in flushing rain gauges, \nbut it is not so clear as in the period of \u201cwashings off\u201d, with a number of weeks with \nlarger TDN collection in the flushing rain gauges than in the standard ones. ANOVA \nanalysis of the dataset (after log-transformation) is consistent with these findings: \nvariation between dates is the main source of variation, but the difference between the \ntwo types of rain gauges is still significant (P<0.001).\n12\n0500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\n28\/05\/2005 25\/10\/2005 24\/03\/2006 21\/08\/2006 18\/01\/2007\n\u00b5m\nol\nes\n N\n m\n-2\n w\nk-\n1\nTDN-Standard Rain Gauges TDN-Flushing Rain Gauges\nFigure 9: Weekly amount of TDN in \u00b5moles N m-2 in standard rain gauges (bulk \ndeposition) and flushing rain gauges (dry + wet deposition).\nError bar shows standard deviation of 3 replicate samplers.\nThe same reasons as during the period with washings switched off would explain \nresults for those weeks with larger TDN collection in standard rain gauges than in \nflushing rain gauges, i.e. N losses along the 1.5 m long silicone tubing, either due to \nbiological activity (as this is a biocide-free area) or due to ion exchange processes \nalong the silicone wall surface. The results for those weeks with larger TDN amounts \ncollected in the flushing rain gauges than in standard rain gauges could arise from one \nor more of the following:\ni) a number of short and not very intense rain events during the collection period. \n(A short rain event would be enough to activate the washing mechanism in the \nflushing rain gauges, therefore efficiently collecting all dry deposition accumulated on \nthe funnel surface. In the case of the standard rain gauges, on the other hand, the same \nshort rain event might not have washed the funnel surface so efficiently and, \ntherefore, the amount of N-species collected might be significantly smaller, at least \nthe fraction coming from dry deposition).\nii) release of material retained on the tubing surfaces during the preceding \nsampling period (tubing was not cleaned each week)\niii) more efficient removal of dry-deposited material from the funnel surface by \nthe 10% methanol wash solution than by rainfall.\nDON \u201cproduction\u201d in flushing rain gauges\nIn the 27 weeks with 3 valid independent replicates for each type of rain gauge, the \ntotal amount of TDN collected in standard rain gauges was 22 \u00b1 3 mmoles N m-2, and \n13\nin the flushing ones (rain + washings) was 15 \u00b1 1 mmoles N m-2. However, the total \namount of DON collected in the standard rain gauges was 5 \u00b1 1 mmoles N m-2, and in \nthe flushing ones (rain + washings) was 7.0 \u00b1 0.4 mmoles N m-2. The type of gauge \ncollecting smaller amounts of TDN (flushing rain gauge) collected larger amounts of \nDON (compare figure 9 with figure 10). The most likely explanation is that a portion \nof the \u2018lost\u2019 DIN is being transformed into DON inside the flushing rain gauges. \nWhere and how this transformation occurs is a matter for further investigation. \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n28\/05\/2005 25\/10\/2005 24\/03\/2006 21\/08\/2006 18\/01\/2007\n\u00b5m\nol\nes\n N\n m\n-2\n w\nk-\n1\nDON-Standard Rain Gauges DON-Flushing Rain Gauges\nFigure 10: Weekly amount of DON in \u00b5moles N m-2 in standard rain gauges (bulk \ndeposition) and flushing rain gauges (dry + wet deposition).\nError bar shows standard deviation of 3 replicate samplers.\nEstimation of the relative contribution of wet and dry deposition\nThe lower and upper bounds to the contribution of dry deposition to the material \ncollected by the standard rain gauge can be estimated from the above results as \nfollows. If all transformations between different N forms are ignored (i.e. working \nwith only the TDN data) then there are two extreme cases: (1) none of the dry \ndeposited material was lost during sampling (a reasonable assumption as it was in \n10% methanol solution), in which case the contribution of dry deposition to TDN is \ngiven by the amount collected as dry deposition as a fraction of the total collected by \nthe standard gauge, i.e. over the 27 weeks of valid samples, 7.5\/14.2 = 53% (Table 1); \nor (2) if the losses of N in the flushing gauge were entirely caused by losses from the \ndry deposition sample, the fraction of dry deposition would rise to (14.2-2.3)\/14.2  = \n84%. \n14\nFor DIN, if transformations from DIN to DON are discounted and no losses from the \nwashings occurred (case 1), the DIN deposited as dry deposition was 3.8\/10.9 = 35% \nof the DIN in the standard sampler (Table 1). For case 2 (losses of DIN were all from \nwashings) the contribution of dry deposition of DIN increases to (10.9-1.5)\/10.9 = \n86%. For DON, the average amount sampled as \u2018dry\u2019 deposition exceeded that \nrecorded in the standard gauge (Table 1), implying either significant transformation \nfrom DIN to DON in the flushing sampler, or that all DON was dry-deposited.\nEstimation of the relative contribution of DON to wet and dry deposition\nThe loss of N from the flushing sampler leads to uncertainties in the apparent fraction \nof TDN contributed by DON, especially with the evidence that some transformation \nof DIN to DON occurred. For the standard bulk sampler, DON represented 23\u00b16% of \nTDN over the 27 weekly samples for which there was a complete data set, or 24\u00b17% \nof TDN for the 38 weekly samples for which there were 3 replicate standard bulk \nsamples (Table 1). These figures should be compared with a value of 26% for 7 \nweekly samples at the same site in 2000 (Cape et al., 2001) or 33% for 54 weekly \nsamples in 2000-2 (Cape et al., 2004) using steel and glass bulk samplers, rather than \npolyethylene funnels and bottles. The construction materials may not be important, \ngiven that the earlier study showed no significant difference between different \nconstruction materials.\nThe present study suggests that the contribution of DON to TDN may differ between \nwet and dry deposition. For wet deposition, the proportion of DON in the collected \nsamples was 36\u00b19%, but the contribution of DON to wet deposition as measured in \nthe standard bulk sampler is uncertain because of the losses in the flushing sampler. \nBecause on average more DON was found in the combined (wet+dry) deposition than \nin the standard sampler, despite overall losses of TDN, this figure represents the upper \nbound to the contribution of DON to wet deposition. The fraction could have been as \nlow as 12%, calculated as the amount of DON measured in wet deposition relative to \nTDN in the standard sampler less TDN measured as dry deposition, i.e. assuming all \nthe \u2018missing\u2019 N from the flushing sampler was originally present as DIN. However, \nthis figure might be even lower, as it has been calculated assuming that no \ntransformation of DIN into DON occurred in wet deposition. By similar arguments, \nthe measured contribution of DON to dry deposition can be calculated as 49\u00b14% \nbased on analysis of the funnel washings, but this could include at least 16\u00b115% from \nconversion of DIN to DON in the washings, calculated from the excess of DON \nmeasured in the flushing samplers compared with the bulk samplers (Table 1). The \ncontribution of DON to dry deposition of TDN is therefore likely to be 33% or less. \nThe lower bound can be calculated assuming all the \u2018missing\u2019 N in the flushing \nsampler is DIN, and that the smallest contribution from DON in the dry sampler \noccurs if none of the DON in the wet sampler comes from conversion of DIN, giving \na value of 21%. \nConclusions\n1-This study presents further evidence of the importance of water soluble organic \nnitrogen (WSON) species in the boundary layer. On average, over the 27 weekly \nsamples with 3 valid replicates for all the collectors, dissolved organic nitrogen \n15\n(DON) represented 23\u00b16% of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) measured in bulk \ndeposition, similar to the proportion of DON observed at this site previously.\n2- The relative contribution of DON to TDN in wet and dry deposition is uncertain \nbecause of losses of N within the flushing sampler, but the upper bound to the \ncontributions is 36\u00b19% for wet deposition and 33\u00b115% for dry deposition.\n3- Dry deposition of particles and gas on the funnel surface, rather than deposition in \nrain, seems to be the main source of N-containing species (both inorganic and \norganic) to the bulk sampler, contributing between 53% and 84% of total N. \n4-In general, larger amounts of N-containing species were collected in the standard \nbulk samplers than in the flushing samplers. This was particularly true during the \nperiod when the washings were not in operation (from 10\/03\/06 to 15\/06\/2006). This \nresult implies chemical or biological interactions in the tubing leading from the funnel \nto the sampling bottle, which might be reduced by replacing silicone tubing with \nPTFE tubing, and by changing the tubing on each sampling occasion. This finding has \nimplications for all types of precipitation sampler in which the funnel and the sample \nbottle are separated by a length of tubing \u2013 a common design.\n5- In the flushing rain gauges, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) seems to be \ntransformed into DON. This phenomenon requires further investigation. Biological \nactivity transforming DIN into DON in the tubing would be a plausible explanation, \ndespite the lack of light. It would be restricted only to the tubing, as both collecting \nbottles (rain and washings) are protected with thymol (a very effective biocide) \nagainst biological degradation. Another explanation might be in the rinsing solution \nfor the washings, which contains 10% methanol to aid wetting of the funnel surface \nand to prevent freezing of the wash solution. Chemical reaction between DIN and \nmethanol to produce organic material is unlikely, but the methanol wash solution may \nbe more effective at removing dry deposited organic nitrogen from the funnel than \nrain water.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank the technical and scientific staff of the Centre for Ecology and \nHydrology for their assistance, in particular Sim Tang.
