They are also applicable to higher-order ODEs\n1 Introduction\nA second-order scalar ordinary di\ufb00erential equation (ODE) of the form\ny\u2032\u2032 = \u03c9(x, y, y\u2032) (1.1)\ncan be solved (that is, reduced to quadrature) if its Lie algebra Lp of point symmetry\ngenerators has dimension two or more. (The ways in which this can be done are described\nin many texts [2, 4, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18, 20].) If the dimension of Lp is less than two, there\nis no guarantee that a reduction to quadrature can be found; however, the ODE may be\nsolved in any of the following circumstances.\n1. A contact transformation is known that maps (1.1) to a solvable ODE. (At present,\nthere is no systematic way of \ufb01nding such transformations.)\n2. The ODE (1.1) has nonlocal potential symmetries relating it to a solvable ODE [2].\n3. The ODE has a one-parameter Lie group of variational point symmetries.\n4. The Lie algebra is one-dimensional, enabling (1.1) to be reduced to a \ufb01rst-order\nODE, and the reduced ODE can be solved by using new symmetries (which are\ncalled Type II hidden symmetries [1]).\nCopyright c\u00a9 2004 by P E Hydon\n234 P E Hydon\nEven if none of the above apply, the problem may still be tractable, because every\nscalar ODE (1.1) has in\ufb01nitely many independent one-parameter Lie groups of contact\nsymmetries [16]. If it is possible to \ufb01nd enough of these groups, they can be used to\nconstruct the solution. Two such groups are su\ufb03cient, provided that di\ufb00erential invariants\nand canonical coordinates can be constructed; this proviso is the chief obstacle to the use\nof contact symmetries that are not point symmetries.\nContact symmetries of higher-order ODEs and scalar partial di\ufb00erential equations\n(PDEs) can be found systematically, but it is not usually possible to \ufb01nd even one contact\nsymmetry of (1.1) by inspection. The problem is similar to that of \ufb01nding point symme-\ntries of \ufb01rst-order ODEs (as discussed in [5, 11]). The classi\ufb01cation of all real Lie groups\nof contact symmetries that act on the (x, y) plane has been completed recently [8]. This\nclassi\ufb01cation holds up to equivalence under contact transformations; however, it does not\nenable one to construct a contact transformation that reduces (1.1) to a simpler form.\nThe current paper outlines a method for testing a given ODE (1.1) for the presence of\nLie contact symmetries whose characteristic function is invariant under the group action.\nThese self-invariant contact symmetries and their di\ufb00erential invariants and canonical\ncoordinates may be constructed systematically.\nNote that this paper deals only with scalar ODEs; contact symmetries of systems of\nODEs are discussed in [7] and the references therein.\n2 Contact symmetries of second-order ODEs\nSophus Lie devoted much e\ufb00ort to investigating contact transformations [14], but much of\nhis work is not yet well-known.1 Therefore we begin by stating some useful facts about Lie\ncontact symmetries of (1.1). A one-parameter (local) Lie group of contact transformations\nof some domain in (x, y, y\u2032) space is a set of smooth transformations\nx\u02dc = x+ \u0005\u03be(x, y, y\u2032) +O(\u00052),\ny\u02dc = y + \u0005\u03b7(x, y, y\u2032) +O(\u00052),\ny\u02dc\u2032 = y\u2032 + \u0005\u03b7(1)(x, y, y\u2032) +O(\u00052),\nde\ufb01ned for all \u0005 in some symmetric neighbourhood of zero, where the contact condition\nrequires that\n\u03b7(1) =\nd\u03b7\ndx\n\u2212 y\u2032 d\u03be\ndx\n. (2.1)\nNote that \u03b7(1) is independent of y\u2032\u2032, and so (2.1) yields\n\u03b7y\u2032 \u2212 y\u2032\u03bey\u2032 = 0.\n(Throughout this paper, variable subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to that\nvariable.) It is helpful to use the characteristic function\nQ(x, y, y\u2032) \u2261 \u03b7 \u2212 y\u2032\u03be\n1Some of Lie\u2019s results are summarized in English in [3].\nSelf-Invariant Contact Symmetries 235\nin terms of which\n\u03be = \u2212Qy\u2032 , \u03b7 = Q\u2212 y\u2032Qy\u2032 , \u03b7(1) = Qx + y\u2032Qy.\nThe action of the Lie group extends to higher derivatives:\ny\u02dc(k) = y(k) + \u0005\u03b7(k)(x, y, . . . , y(k\u22121), y(k)) +O(\u00052),\nwhere\n\u03b7(k) =\nd\u03b7(k\u22121)\ndx\n\u2212 y(k) d\u03be\ndx\n=\ndkQ\ndxk\n\u2212 y(k+1)Qy\u2032 .\nThe in\ufb01nitesimal generator of the Lie group is\nX = \u03be\u2202x + \u03b7\u2202y,\nand the action of the group on derivatives of order k or less is generated by the kth\nprolongation of the generator, namely\nX(k) = \u03be\u2202x + \u03b7\u2202y + \u03b7(1)\u2202y\u2032 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03b7(k)\u2202y(k) .\nTransformations in the Lie group are contact symmetries of (1.1) if and only if\nX(2)\n(\ny\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03c9(x, y, y\u2032)) = 0 when y\u2032\u2032 = \u03c9(x, y, y\u2032),\nwhich amounts to the following constraint on Q:\nQxx + 2y\u2032Qxy + y\u20322Qyy + (2Qxy\u2032 + 2y\u2032Qyy\u2032 +Qy)\u03c9 +Qy\u2032y\u2032\u03c92\n= \u2212Qy\u2032\u03c9x + (Q\u2212 y\u2032Qy\u2032)\u03c9y + (Qx + y\u2032Qy)\u03c9y\u2032 . (2.2)\nFor any given smooth \u03c9(x, y, y\u2032), the symmetry condition (2.2) has in\ufb01nitely many non-\ntrivial solutions, any one of which may be used (in principle) to reduce the ODE to one of\n\ufb01rst order. There are two main di\ufb03culties, the \ufb01rst of which is to \ufb01nd a solution of (2.2).\nUsually, attention is restricted to point symmetries, for which \u03be and \u03b7 are independent of\ny\u2032. Then the ansatz\nQ(x, y, y\u2032) = \u03b7(x, y)\u2212 y\u2032\u03be(x, y)\nis substituted into (2.2), and powers of y\u2032 are equated to obtain an overdetermined system\nof PDEs for \u03be and \u03b7; it is usually straightforward to solve this system. If the Lie point\nsymmetries of (1.1) are insu\ufb03cient to solve the ODE, one can try an ansatz with Q\nnonlinear in y\u2032. To have a good chance of success the ansatz should not be too restrictive,\nbut (generally speaking) the more restrictive the ansatz, the easier it is to calculate Q\nfrom (2.2). The ansatz for point symmetries achieves a good balance between generality\nand calculability.\nThe second di\ufb03culty lies in \ufb01nding two independent \ufb01rst order di\ufb00erential invariants\nr(x, y, y\u2032) and v(x, y, y\u2032) with which to reduce the ODE. These di\ufb00erential invariants satisfy\nX(1)r = 0, X(1)v = 0, (2.3)\n236 P E Hydon\nwhere\nX(1) \u2261 \u2212Qy\u2032\u2202x + (Q\u2212 y\u2032Qy\u2032)\u2202y + (Qx + y\u2032Qy)\u2202y\u2032 . (2.4)\nAlthough (2.3) can be solved in principle by the method of characteristics, the character-\nistic equations\ndx\n\u2212Qy\u2032 =\ndy\nQ\u2212 y\u2032Qy\u2032 =\ndy\u2032\nQx + y\u2032Qy\n(2.5)\nare typically hard to solve. An advantage of using point symmetries is that the \ufb01rst\nequation in (2.5) can be solved before the second one; this yields a di\ufb00erential invariant r\n(that is independent of y\u2032) which can assist in the calculation of v.\nWriting the ODE (1.1) in terms of the di\ufb00erential invariants, we obtain a \ufb01rst-order\nODE of the form\ndv\ndr\n= \u2126(r, v). (2.6)\nThe general solution of (2.6) is a \ufb01rst-order ODE\nF\n(\nr(x, y, y\u2032), v(x, y, y\u2032); c1\n)\n= 0, c1 constant, (2.7)\nthat is invariant under the group generated by X. If this group consists of point symme-\ntries, (2.7) is solved by introducing a canonical coordinate s(x, y) such that\nXs = 1.\nThen v(x, y, y\u2032) is a function of r(x, y) and dsdr only, and so (2.7) can be written (locally)\nin the form\nds\ndr\n= f(r; c1),\nand solved by quadrature. A similar approach works for (non-point) contact symmetries.\nHere the canonical coordinate is of the form s(x, y, y\u2032), and satis\ufb01es\nX(1)s = 1. (2.8)\nDirect computation shows that\nX(2)\nds\ndr\n= 0,\nand therefore there is some function \u03a6 such that\nds\ndr\n= \u03a6\n(\nr, v,\ndv\ndr\n)\n. (2.9)\nIf (2.7) is solvable for either r or v, then (2.6), (2.7) and (2.9) can be combined to determine\ns by quadrature. Generally speaking, the solution to (1.1) will be given in parametric form;\nin some cases, the parameters can be eliminated to obtain the general solution in the form\nG(x, y; c1, c2) = 0,\nwhere c1, c2 are arbitrary constants (see [6] for details of parameter elimination algorithms).\nSelf-Invariant Contact Symmetries 237\n3 Self-Invariance\nIn view of the di\ufb03culty of \ufb01nding di\ufb00erential invariants of non-point Lie contact sym-\nmetries, we restrict attention to symmetries whose characteristic function Q(x, y, y\u2032) is\ninvariant under the group action. The idea is that having found one di\ufb00erential invariant,\nr(x, y, y\u2032) = Q, it is easier to \ufb01nd v(x, y, y\u2032) and s(x, y, y\u2032). The characteristic function is\ninvariant if and only if\nX(1)Q = QQy = 0.\nTo be of any use, the symmetry group must be non-trivial, so we ignore the trivial solution\nQ = 0 and describe Lie contact symmetries as self-invariant if Qy = 0. For self-invariant\ncontact symmetries, the condition (2.2) reduces to\nQxx + 2Qxy\u2032\u03c9 +Qy\u2032y\u2032\u03c92 = \u2212Qy\u2032\u03c9x + (Q\u2212 y\u2032Qy\u2032)\u03c9y +Qx\u03c9y\u2032 . (3.1)\nThis symmetry condition can be decomposed into an overdetermined system by equating\npowers of y, provided that \u03c9y \u0006= 0. Subject to this proviso, the self-invariant contact\nsymmetries can be calculated explicitly. If \u03c9y = 0, the ODE is immediately reducible to\na \ufb01rst-order ODE for z = y\u2032; henceforth, we assume that \u03c9y \u0006= 0.\nOnce Q has been found, v and s are determined from the following results. If Qy\u2032 \u0006= 0\nthen solve Q = Q(x, y\u2032) for y\u2032 and calculate\n\u03a8(x,Q) \u2261\n\u222b\ny\u2032(x,Q) dx, (3.2)\ntreating Q as a parameter. Even if a closed-form solution cannot be found, \u03a8 can be\ndetermined as a power series if Q is locally analytic in y\u2032.\nTheorem 1. Given a self-invariant contact symmetry group with Qy\u2032 \u0006= 0, de\ufb01ne \u03a8\naccording to (3.2), and let\nr = Q, v = \u03a8\u2212Q\u03a8Q \u2212 y, s = \u2212\u03a8Q, (3.3)\nwriting v and s in terms of (x, y, y\u2032). Then\nX(1)r = 0, X(1)v = 0, X(1)s = 1.\nProof. Apply X(1) to each of r, v and s in turn, and use the chain rule. \u0001\nIn some instances, it is easier to solve Q for x instead of y\u2032. Then it is possible to construct\nv and s by de\ufb01ning\n\u0398(y\u2032, Q) \u2261\n\u222b\nx(y\u2032, Q) dy\u2032. (3.4)\nTheorem 2. Given a self-invariant contact symmetry group with Qx \u0006= 0, de\ufb01ne \u0398 ac-\ncording to (3.4), and let\nr = Q, v = Q\u0398Q + y\u2032\u0398y\u2032 \u2212\u0398\u2212 y, s = \u0398Q, (3.5)\nwriting v and s in terms of (x, y, y\u2032). Then\nX(1)r = 0, X(1)v = 0, X(1)s = 1.\n238 P E Hydon\nProof. The proof is the same as in the previous theorem. \u0001\nNote that in each theorem r and v are functionally independent di\ufb00erential invariants.\nWith either of the above choices of (r, v, s), a straightforward calculation shows that (2.9)\namounts to\nds\ndr\n=\n1\nr\ndv\ndr\n, (3.6)\nand so (2.7) can be reduced to quadrature if it can be solved for r or v. For completeness,\nnote that the only remaining case is Q = 1, which yields point symmetries with\nr = x, s = y, v =\nds\ndr\n= y\u2032.\nHaving found generators of self-invariant contact symmetries (and possibly of a one-\nparameter group of point symmetries as well), it is straightforward to determine the struc-\nture of the minimal Lie algebra, L, that contains the known generators. So far, we have\nfocused on characteristic functions, rather than on the generators which are determined\nby (2.4). The structure of L may be found directly from the characteristic functions, using\nthe following result:\n[X1, X2] = X3 \u21d4 Q3 = (Q1x + y\u2032Q1y)Q2y\u2032 +Q1Q2y \u2212 (Q2x + y\u2032Q2y)Q1y\u2032 \u2212Q2Q1y .\n(Here characteristic functions and their corresponding generators are labelled by the same\nsu\ufb03x.) With a slight abuse of notation, de\ufb01ne the commutator of Q1 and Q2 to be\n[Q1, Q2] \u2261 (Q1x + y\u2032Q1y)Q2y\u2032 +Q1Q2y \u2212 (Q2x + y\u2032Q2y)Q1y\u2032 \u2212Q2Q1y . (3.7)\nThe set of characteristic functions of all in\ufb01nitesimal generators in a given Lie algebra\ninherit the structure of that Lie algebra, and so it is possible to examine solvability directly,\nwithout having to construct the in\ufb01nitesimal generators.\nSuppose that Q1 and Q2 both generate self-invariant contact symmetries (in (x, y, y\u2032)\ncoordinates). Then (3.7) simpli\ufb01es to\n[Q1, Q2] = Q1xQ2y\u2032 \u2212Q2xQ1y\u2032 . (3.8)\nThe commutator of Q1 and Q2 is independent of y, and therefore the set of all Lie contact\nsymmetries that are self-invariant in a particular coordinate system forms a Lie algebra.\nIn particular, self-invariant contact symmetries commute if and only if their characteristic\nfunctions are functionally dependent.\n4 Example\nTo illustrate the method, consider the ODE\ny\u2032\u2032 = y\u2032 +\n(ln(y\u2032)\u2212 x)y\u20322\ny \u2212 y\u2032 . (4.1)\nThe only Lie point symmetries of (4.1) are those whose characteristic function is\nQ1 = y \u2212 y\u2032.\nSelf-Invariant Contact Symmetries 239\nThe di\ufb00erential invariants of the group whose characteristic function is Q1 are r1 = e\u2212xy\nand v1 = y\u2032\/y. Writing (4.1) in terms of (r1, v1) yields the \ufb01rst order ODE\ndv1\ndr1\n=\nv21{1\u2212 ln(r1v1)}\nr1(1\u2212 v1)2 \u2212\nv1\nr1\n, (4.2)\nwhich seems to be intractable.\nHaving failed to solve (4.1) using its point symmetries, we now seek self-invariant\ncontact symmetries. Substituting the right-hand side of (4.1) for \u03c9 in the symmetry\ncondition (3.1), then equating powers of (y \u2212 y\u2032), yields the following overdetermined\nsystem of PDEs:\nQxx + 2y\u2032Qxy\u2032 + y\u20322Qy\u2032y\u2032 = Qx , (4.3)\ny\u20322{ln(y\u2032)\u2212 x} (Qxy\u2032 + y\u2032Qy\u2032y\u2032) = y\u2032 {ln(y\u2032)\u2212 x\u2212 12}Qx + 12y\u20322Qy\u2032 , (4.4)\ny\u20322{ln(y\u2032)\u2212 x}Qy\u2032y\u2032 = Qx + y\u2032Qy\u2032 \u2212Q. (4.5)\nGenerally speaking, it is easiest to solve this type of system with the aid of computer\nalgebra. Reliable packages are available that will reduce overdetermined systems of PDEs\nto a di\ufb00erential Gro\u00a8bner basis that is far easier to solve than the original system [15, 19].\nHowever, our example is easily solved by hand, because (4.3) can be factorized into\n(\n\u2202\n\u2202y\u2032\n+\n1\ny\u2032\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n)2\nQ = 0.\nTherefore the general solution of (4.3) is\nQ = y\u2032F\n(\nln(y\u2032)\u2212 x)+G (ln(y\u2032)\u2212 x) , (4.6)\nwhere F and G are arbitrary functions. Substituting (4.6) into (4.4) and (4.5) yields the\nresults\nF (z) = 0, (4.7)\nG\u2032\u2032(z)\u2212G\u2032(z) + 1\nz\nG(z) = 0. (4.8)\nThus the Lie algebra of self-invariant characteristic functions is two-dimensional and is\nspanned by\nQ2 = ln(y\u2032)\u2212 x, Q3 = {ln(y\u2032)\u2212 x}\n\u222b ln(y\u2032)\u2212x\nz\u22122ez dz.\nNote that Q3 is a function of Q2, so Span(Q2, Q3) is abelian. Furthermore\n[Q1, Q2] = \u2212Q2, [Q1, Q3] = \u2212Q3,\nso L = Span(Q1, Q2, Q3) is a solvable non-abelian Lie algebra. The reduction of order\nusing the point symmetries generated by Q1 is non-normal, and it is common for non-\nnormal reductions of order to produce ODEs as apparently intractable as (4.2). To avoid\nthis problem, either Q2 or Q3 should be used \ufb01rst; we use Q2, as it is in closed form.\n240 P E Hydon\nDi\ufb00erential invariants corresponding to self-invariant contact symmetries are found by\nthe method outlined earlier. Here \u03a8(x,Q) = exp(x+Q), and therefore\nr = ln(y\u2032)\u2212 x, v = {1 + x\u2212 ln(y\u2032)}y\u2032 \u2212 y, s = \u2212y\u2032. (4.9)\nThen (4.1) reduces to the \ufb01rst order ODE\ndv\ndr\n= v, (4.10)\nwhich inherits the symmetries generated by Q1 as scalings in v. The general solution of\n(4.10) is\nv = c1er,\nwhere c1 is an arbitrary constant. Therefore, from (3.6), we obtain\ns = c1\n\u222b r\nz\u22121ez dz + c2,\nwhere c2 is a second arbitrary constant. Substituting these results into (4.9) yields the\ngeneral solution of (4.1) in parametric form:\nx = ln\n(\n\u2212c1\n\u222b r\nz\u22121ez dz \u2212 c2\n)\n\u2212 r, (4.11)\ny = (r \u2212 1)\n(\nc1\n\u222b r\nz\u22121ez dz + c2\n)\n\u2212 c1er. (4.12)\n5 Conclusions\nThe method of \ufb01nding and using self-invariant contact symmetries is easy to use, and can\nyield solutions to ODEs that are not solvable by other means. It is capable of implemen-\ntation as a computer algebra program; the development of such a program would enhance\nexisting symmetry-\ufb01nding software (see [10] for a review).\nThe point of view taken in this paper is that the standard method of \ufb01nding Lie\npoint symmetries amounts to substituting a good ansatz into the symmetry condition\n(2.2). Here \u2018good\u2019 means that an appropriate balance is struck between generality and\ncalculability. The set of all possible Lie point symmetries is characterized by two functions\nof two variables, \u03be(x, y) and \u03b7(x, y), whereas the set of all possible self-invariant contact\nsymmetries is characterized by a single function of two variables, namely Q(x, y\u2032). Thus\nthe self-invariant contact symmetries are less general than point symmetries. However,\nin view of the di\ufb03culty of performing symmetry reduction with non-point Lie groups, it\nis perhaps surprising that such a rich class of symmetries should be both calculable and\nusable. We have focused on second-order ODEs, but the results of Theorems 1 and 2 can\nalso be used to solve higher-order ODEs that have self-invariant contact symmetries.\nAcknowledgements\nThis investigation was supported by NIH Research Grant No. 1 R01 HL070542-01A1.\nSelf-Invariant Contact Symmetries 241\nReferences\n[1] Abraham-Shrauner B, Hidden symmetries and linearization of the modi\ufb01ed Painleve\u00b4-\nInce equation, J.
