Questions about the emancipation of women,\nthe relationship of responsibility between corporations and the communities in which\nthey operate, or questions about the nature of management as a way of running profit-\nmaking operations, remain central to the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. It is pre-\ncisely because these topics have not ceased to be pivotal for our understanding of the\nkind of social order modern capitalism represents that historical investigation inspired by\nthe modern novel in general represents an indispensable course of reflection.\nThe value of Wells\u2019s novel is that it allows a direct and clear examination of\nsuch themes. However, its most important feature is that it is not only a historical\ndocument in the sense of recording defining questions and debates of a specific\nepoch, but that it treats these questions with literary devices of which the funda-\nmental ingredient is the tragic emplotment of ethics (including business ethics) in\nits concrete everyday context. We argue that a close reading of Wells brings forth\nthe historicity of \u2018ethics\u2019 that is disregarded in the mainstream of \u2018business ethics\u2019.\nIn our view, ethics and history are not separate domains of life or of its sciences. The\nethical cannot be understood outside its historical context, or vice versa. Human\nexistence is specifically ethical \u2013 at personal, institutional and societal levels. Thus,\ninterpreting this literary work allows us to relate ethics with history, with the tem-\nporality of human existence, and with its main determination: finitude. We will\nexplain the implications of these assumptions in a conceptual section following\nthis introduction.\nThis novel is also stimulating in pedagogical terms. It brings to the fore the often\nneglected claim that business ethics can only be taught from a historical perspective. In\nour view, the novel shows that only a historical contextualization of business phenom-\nena opens up the horizon of questioning the nature of our practices in management and\nbusiness. In this respect, we could argue that the study of literary sources from the belles-\nlettres is much richer than what is traditionally known as \u2018case study\u2019 teaching. This line\nof argument will also be explained in the following section and in the conclusions.\nWells is, of course, only one among numerous authors for whom questions about\nthe formation of the modern business ethos in the last three to four centuries were at\nthe centre of their endeavours. The briefest of perusals of literature between the 17th\nand 20th centuries shows that the thematic associated with \u2018business ethics\u2019 has been\nwidely explored in a multitude of forms from philosophical essays, to social theories,\nto novels, theatre, and poetry, to journalism. From its earliest historical stages, the\nemergence of modern businesses provoked heated debates that delineate the contem-\nporary domain of \u2018business ethics\u2019: what are the \u2018goods\u2019 and the \u2018bads\u2019 of modern busi-\nness enterprises? What might count as fair, just, virtuous, and socially responsible in\nrelation to business ideas, actions, and institutions (mainly in the form of increasingly\nlarge for-profit corporations)? What should count as fraud or crime in business?\nWhere should checks and balances be placed? What ought to count as personal ver-\nsus institutional responsibility for failure? How should whistle blowing be treated?\nMANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY 2(3)\n238\n \u00a9 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

How able is the \u2018invisible hand\u2019? Does it exist? How well do money-\nmaking activities and institutions serve as the social and cultural spaces in which the\nfundamental values of modernity \u2013 freedom, emancipation, self-assertion and self-\nexpression, democracy and economic participation (all well known from the pro-\ngrammes of the American and French revolutionary moments of 1776 and 1789, to\ncite but two examples) \u2013 can be affirmed and defended?\nTo mention only a few of those who focused on such themes in the 19th and early\n20th centuries, we not only find the field populated by major social theorists of capi-\ntalism (Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, Thorstein Veblen, Georg Simmel,\nWerner Sombart, or Richard Tawney), but also by modern novelists such as Honor\u00e9\nde Balzac (1978), \u00c9mile Zola (1954), William Dean Howells (1983), Charles Dickens\n(1890), Marcel Proust (1954), Henry James (1999), Thomas Mann (1957), Upton\nSinclair (1965), or Robert Musil (1997). For all, a key preoccupation was to compre-\nhend how modernity revolves around a new cultural economy in which money, enter-\nprise, and management play a central ethical role. Ever since, these preoccupations\nhave continued. From Miller\u2019s Death of a Salesman (1949), or Mamet\u2019s Glengarry Glen\nRoss (1984) plays, to Weiser and Stone\u2019s Wall Street (1987) movie, the analysis of var-\nious aspects of business culture has been uninterrupted.\nWe chose H.G. Wells\u2019s 1914 novel because it is a straightforward and very illu-\nminating commentary upon the formation of the modern business ethos. It is thus\nmanageable as an illustration of our main points, and equally manageable as a poten-\ntial instrument for teaching business ethics in a historical perspective. This article will\ntherefore be a relatively forthright interpretation of H.G. Wells\u2019s work as a substantial\npiece of historical evidence about the cultural context of business and management in\nthe early twentieth century. We are not however developing a literary critique; rather\nwe attempt to understand how the modern novel, as a literary form, gains access to cul-\ntural and ethical sensibilities of a particular historical period which are not visible in\nmechanical approaches to ethics in general, or business ethics specifically.\nConceptual Premises\n(1) Ethics, History and Finitude\nIn this section, we will clarify our conceptual premises in order to show how the \u2018eth-\nical\u2019 is bound up with the \u2018historical\u2019. In our view, ethos and history are fundamentally\ninterconnected and one cannot be understood without the other, bound together as\nthey are by the specific nature of the human condition. To explain this proposition, we\nwill deploy ideas inspired by Martin Heidegger\u2019s main work: Being and Time (1962).\nOf course, it is impossible to discuss Heidegger\u2019s general thinking here. We\nwould have to rely on the reader\u2019s willingness to accept the following ideas as the per-\nspective from which the rest of the paper makes sense. We can only state our inter-\npretation of an existential position on the \u2018ethical\u2019 and the \u2018historical\u2019 in the most\nCRUMP ET AL.:A HISTORICAL-CULTURAL APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF BUSINESS ETHICS \n239\n \u00a9 2007 SAGE Publications.

We have to clarify these\nfundamental commitments, albeit on such a fragile basis, in order to provide the con-\nceptual framework of our arguments.\nTreading as carefully as we can on this ontological ground, we want to posit the\nirreducible awareness of finitude as the foundational element of our understanding of the\nrelationship between the ethical and the historical dimensions of the specific human\nway of being in the world. This awareness is the central constituent of the human con-\ndition amongst other forms of life. We take this as a very contentious premise and one\nwhich deserves more than a simple enunciation; but in the space of this article we can-\nnot explore it much further. The awareness of finitude frames human existence mainly\nin its temporal dimension. This is why Heidegger\u2019s title is such a powerful affirmation\nof what makes humans a different kind of being amongst others in the world.\nTemporality, the awareness of our certain, and yet mysterious, mortal nature, makes\nhumans ethical and historical beings: we are in a perpetual quest, so to speak, to make\nsense of our condition, we are \u2018concerned\u2019 \u2013 as Heidegger puts it \u2013 to be, to maintain\nour being in the world and with others in a way which makes life worthwhile \u2013 know-\ning full well that it has an inevitable end. Negotiating fundamental and very concrete\nquestions \u2013 \u2018what is a worthwhile existence?\u2019; \u2018what constitutes a \u2018good life\u2019?\u2019; \u2018what\ndoes it mean to be \u2018good\u2019 to oneself and to others when time is, as it were, always run-\nning out, always \u2018against\u2019 us?\u2019 \u2013 is not, in Heidegger\u2019s argument, a by-product of the\nhuman condition. Rather, the ethical (which is what finitude \u2018makes\u2019 us) is central to\nbeing human. There is, in other words, nothing about humanness that is not ethical\n(that is, bound up with the need to articulate our existence in its concrete everyday\nunfolding in the process of valuation) to the extent that there is nothing in our nature\nthat is not finite.\nFrom this perspective, \u2018micro\u2019 levels of personal life (understood in concrete, almost\n\u2018capillary\u2019 details), and \u2018macro\u2019 levels (institutional arrangements in all spheres \u2013 \neconomic, political, social \u2013 embodying collective systems of beliefs and values in \nsocietal terms) are never separable as simple functional spheres. Rather, they are all\nexpressions of each other, of the ethical aspirations formed by the temporal awareness\nof life\u2019s finite parameters.\n(2) The Tragic and the Ethical in the Novel Form\nWhat is interesting at this juncture is the relationship between the literary form of the\nmodern realist novel and the historical transformations at personal, institutional and soci-\netal levels brought about by the rise of business corporations and management control as\nexpressions of a new horizon of understanding how people might live \u2018better lives\u2019.\nWe premise our argument on the following idea: that the modern novel is not sim-\nply a work of fiction disconnected from historical realities, but rather a work of fiction\nthat allows access to historical realities in a specific way. Different in kind from mono-\ngraphic historical research, the modern novel represents relevant material in two main\nrespects. First, it is a form of literature whose central preoccupation is the material,\nMANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY 2(3)\n240\n \u00a9 2007 SAGE Publications. All rights reserved. Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution.\n at Lancaster University on October 24, 2007 http:\/\/moh.sagepub.comDownloaded from \ncultural, social and moral detail of ordinary contemporary lives (not of mythical, trans-\nhistorical figures). In this sense, it opens windows on to social spaces and practices, on\nto mentalities and sensitivities made more directly visible for critical study (by com-\nparison with previous literary forms). Secondly, it weaves details which inspire a more\ndramatic reflection upon some of the key dilemmas of certain periods. The form of the\nnovel (especially the tragic) and the style employed in the belles-lettres offer a rich oppor-\ntunity to see some of the links between the ethical and the historical in cultural con-\ntext, to explore some of the complex, uncertain and forever troubling relationships\nbetween personal and social lives, between personal crises and public debates, between\nthe private domain of \u2018domestic life\u2019 and public institutional forms.\nBut behind the modern novel there is more than just an interesting new literary\nform. Its own emergence in the history of modern consciousness is a sign of a more pro-\nfound process which needs to be briefly mentioned here. The question arises: why was\nthere a need for a new form of mythos, for a new kind of \u2018scripture\u2019 when the pre-\nmodern (Medieval) cultural synthesis was predicated upon a very strong mythological\nconstruction \u2013 Christian Scholasticism? It is precisely in the fact that the Medieval\nworldview ceased to offer sufficient ground for self- and world-understanding that we\ncan locate the need for an original form in which European societies could express the\nradical repositioning of \u2018man\u2019 and his \u2018ordinary life\u2019 at the centre of the new epoch,\nmodernity. In other words, the modern novel is not just a decorative addition, but a\nprofound reorientation of modes of self-expression in the specific context created by\nthe modern configuration: modern man, left standing in solitude by the dissolution\nof traditional bonds with divinity and nature, finds himself in a perpetual quest for\nmeaning. As Dupr\u00e9 (1993, 101) argues, \u2018When meaning is no longer given with exis-\ntence, existence itself becomes a quest for meaning.\u2019 This marks a new predicament\nfor \u2018man\u2019: on the one hand, modernity liberates the human subject from the shackles\nof dogmatic determination by the divine; on the other hand, this liberation takes away\nfrom \u2018man\u2019 the predetermined content of \u2018his\u2019 life. The new character at the centre of\nhistory, the \u2018modern subject\u2019, has to invent the contents of his concrete, everyday, \u2018des-\ntiny\u2019. In ethical terms, the most difficult question that confronts \u2018modern man\u2019 is \u2018who\nam I?\u2019. In this formulation, this question denotes what we might call, in traditional\nterms, the tragic as such.\nIn this sense, our analysis differs fundamentally from mainstream literature that\ndeals with the thematic of \u2018business ethics\u2019 for which the historical nature of ethical\nproblems and its open nature are not a central feature. When the ethical is presented\nas a \u2018business problem\u2019 to be \u2018solved\u2019, ethics becomes a set of temporary questions of\nprinciples of morality (rather than ethics), that may yield some sort of normative basis\nfor \u2018good business behaviours\u2019 (see, for example, Beauchamp and Bowie 2004; Jackson\n1996; Pratley 1995). Questions of ethical behaviour are customarily placed in pseudo-\ntranscendental horizons. For instance, Bowie (1999) attempts to formulate a conclu-\nsive model based on Kant\u2019s \u2018categorical imperatives\u2019 from which the architectonic of\ngood\/bad business practices will emerge. By addressing the question, \u2018how would a\nbusiness firm in a capitalist economy be structured and managed according to the\nCRUMP ET AL.:A HISTORICAL-CULTURAL APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF BUSINESS ETHICS \n241\n \u00a9 2007 SAGE Publications.

His argument is that\nKantian imperatives can be translated into universal, ahistorical principles for \u2018good\nbusiness management\u2019.\nFor mainstream thinking, this is the convenient reading and institutes the para-\ndigm in which questions of ethics are posed in organizations. They become technical\nor therapeutic problems that can always be resolved. In its own worldview, main-\nstream business thinking is always sufficient to close up the open horizon of the eth-\nical within the managerial. All ethical problems appear always as contingent, as\nepisodes of technical or therapeutic relevance, as moments that can be worked out on\nthe basis of ahistorical \u2018categorical imperatives\u2019. Pratley \u2018postulates that business\nethics provides a basic outlook to the training of a business manager. \u2026 the main\nobjective of this book is therefore to introduce general concepts and standards for\nmoral behaviour in business\u2019 (1995, xiii-xiv). In this perspective, \u2018ethics\u2019 becomes a\n\u2018method\u2019 (for a technical issue) needed by managers projected as the only ethical\nagents in a firm. This operation presupposes that the historical process \u2013 as a mani-\nfestation of the tragic nature of human life itself \u2013 is irrelevant and homogeneous.\nIn our reading of Wells, it is precisely by emphasizing the tragic form of his novel\nthat we seek to move beyond the ahistorical limitations of such approaches. Without\nthe tragic, the ethical remains a question of technical reparation. It articulates no ten-\nsion inherent and continuous in human affairs. The source of business ethics as a man-\nagerial method and technique lies in the denial of the tragic. As Joyce put it, the\ntragic brings with it \u2018the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of whatsoever\nis grave and constant in human suffering\u2019, in the ethical itself (1916, 239). This grave\nand continuous self-questioning which forms the ethical horizon of being human (as\na manifestation of our finitude) is derecognized in business ethics because, as Steiner\nargues, \u2018in tragedy there is a wildness and a refusal running against the grain of \nmiddle-class sensibility\u2019 (1961, 8).\nWhat does the tragic form mean in this context? As the most direct way to under-\nstand its value and significance, we employ a well-known classical text, Aristotle\u2019s Poetics\n(1996, section 4, 10\u201313). Aristotle discusses tragedy as that literary form in which ethi-\ncal dilemmas emerge and personal lives appear in their fundamental interconnection\nwith sociality. Thus, tragedy allows the formulation of a collective context \u2013 the\n\u2018theatre\u2019 \u2013 where the exploration of real human drama (understood in the Greek sense of\nthe word as \u2018action\u2019), and its multifaceted ethical dimensions, come to light. Placed upon\na \u2018stage\u2019, ethics becomes visible with its tense, open questions of \u2018value\u2019 as the defining\nterms of \u2018life\u2019. In this sense, the kind of literature explored here acts as a source of reflec-\ntion upon the ethics of \u2018business\u2019 in the living, existential domain of the characters and\nnot simply as an impersonal, institutionalized epiphenomenon that can be codified and\nobjectified through a set of limited questions and even more limited answers.\nWells combines the traditional constituents of tragedy: characters who recognize\npersonal crises but also their own ethical ignorance and inabilities, suffering in the dra-\nmatic attempt to face up to these crises, and even more dramatically trying to reverse\nMANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY 2(3)\n242\n \u00a9 2007 SAGE Publications.

These are all woven in the novel in ways that go beyond the\npossibilities of the case study method. The tragic alignment of characters and situa-\ntions becomes the central device for opening up the ways in which dilemmas of \u2018busi-\nness ethics\u2019 are linked to lived personal and collective experiences; it shows how\n\u2018characters\u2019 bring ethics to life, how the \u2018ethical\u2019 emerges as the dynamo of daily, con-\ncrete human existence. Thus ethics is no longer an after-effect of human action\n(drama), not simply a matter of principle (what ought to be done), but a matter of\nsocial \u2018fact\u2019, of direct action, of what is done. Reading Wells shows the complexity of\npersonal involvement in all aspects of the social: from the realm of the domus (domes-\ntic life), to the realm of social institutions and civic life. These multiple actions form\ncharacters and their \u2018lifeworlds\u2019 and delineate the framing of ethical problems. In ped-\nagogical terms, not only are customary business case studies never explored in the\nmanner of tragedy or drama, but they are often almost purposefully immunized\nagainst the \u2018messy\u2019 and hardly ever resolvable conflicts created by the modern system\nof social order where the \u2018business corporation\u2019 occupies the centre.\nMoreover, in Wells\u2019s novel it is not only the form of modern tragedy deployed that\nrequires explicit mention; his style plays a fundamental role too. He does not raise\ncentral concerns in solemn, radical or uncompromising tones. Rather, Wells writes in\nan ironic style which is not a marginal feature. Irony brings to light an even more essen-\ntial and disturbing characteristic of the modern value system. His ironic style is\ndeployed to reveal modernity\u2019s agitation and powerlessness in articulating its own eth-\nical foundations. Wells confronts his \u2018time\u2019 ironically precisely in order to emphasize\nthat its scale of values is not capable of answers that add up to its own historical\nagenda. Wells\u2019s irony illustrates what Taylor (1989, 53\u201391) calls the \u2018ethics of inar-\nticulacy\u2019 of the modern age. Taylor\u2019s syntagm signifies here the specific character of\nmodernity as that \u2018historical-cultural \u201cevent\u201d which changes the relationship between\nthe universe, its transcendent horizon, and its human interpreter\u2019 (Dupr\u00e9 1993, 249)\nthat results in a new cultural synthesis whose underlying principle (the subjectum) is\nthe human subject itself. The modern \u2018self\u2019 emerges in the new order (the \u2018Copernican\nWorld\u2019, in Blumenberg\u2019s terms, 1987) as the sole point of reference because old cer-\ntainties by which the world appeared as a pre-ordered, supreme \u2018cosmos\u2019, governed by\nan omnipotent \u2018Creator\u2019 and guardian, dissolved. The human no longer occupies a pas-\nsive, contemplative, predetermined place; but is rather faced with the only alternative\nfor survival: self-assertion through labour. In becoming the sole ground for questions\nof value (for the formation of ethical behaviour), the modern \u2018self\u2019 operates in the\nworld in a horizon of infinite aspirations and an infinite sense of entitlement to every-\nthing. This new sense of identity marks the threshold of a new ethical epoch in which\nthe finitude of human existence and of the world are increasingly derecognized. How\nis it possible for the modern subject to articulate for itself, and to follow, \u2018transcen-\ndental\u2019 ethical principles of which it is the very principium?\nWells\u2019s novel marks these fundamental questions explicitly, as we will show\nbelow. By combining themes, form and style, his novel becomes a historically relevant\nbasis for debating business ethics.

The underly-\ning message of the novel exposes the problematic of what we term (paraphrasing\nTaylor 1989) modern ethical inarticulacy: the middle-class desire and sense of enti-\ntlement to \u2018have it all\u2019 without recognizing in any kind of articulate framework the\nfinite nature of itself and of its world.\nAnd it is against this emerging mentality of \u2018entitlement to everything\u2019 without\nlimits, against this mentality in which finitude is derecognized, that Wells plays his last\nironic card: he deprives his characters of access to the resolution of their own tragedies.\nHe shows their inability to experience the closure of their ethical dilemmas through\nsome final articulation of their own condition. He deprives them of catharsis, of the\ncleansing of consciousness, the concluding and humanizing element of ancient tragedy.\nH.G.Wells\u2019s The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman (1914) as an Essay on Life,\nCulture and Business at the Beginning of the Twentieth Century\nGeneral Context\nThis article deals with one of Wells\u2019s \u2018marriage novels\u2019. He published three such novels\nbetween 1912 and 1914: Marriage (1912), The Passionate Friends (1913), and The Wife of\nSir Isaac Harman (1914). In contrast to his well-known science-fiction pieces, in these\nnovels about ordinary life Wells explores problems of marriage in the Edwardian era.\nThey are some of his least-known, read, or studied works. In fact, he foresaw their slip-\nping out of fashion in his Experiment in Autobiography (1934, 392): \u2018They had their func-\ntion in their time but their time has already gone by. \u2026 No one will ever read them for\ndelight.\u2019 He was in a sense right, but it is their focus upon a subject matter of major sig-\nnificance (women\u2019s political, social, economic, cultural emancipation) and his ability to\nsituate it in its wider cultural and historical context, that grounds their historical worth.\nThe Wife of Sir Isaac Harman (1914) reflects upon the cultural reconfiguration of\nmodern British society at the turn of the twentieth century. What is even more inter-\nesting \u2013 and of direct concern here \u2013 is that, although it is a novel ostensibly about\nmarriage, Wells\u2019s edifice is built around the central place of business in the architecture\nof the new social space delineated by the then emerging entrepreneurial bourgeoisie.\nIts entire dramatic structure is based around Sir Isaac\u2019s corporate affairs and his wife\u2019s\nengagement with them. Chapter by chapter, the novel unfolds as a series of funda-\nmental but concrete questions about the ethos of modernity. First, there is the ques-\ntion about the emancipation of women and about how the public and private spheres\nmark the cultural importance of male and female characters. How is their respective\naccess to the social, the political and the economic to be interpreted and placed in his-\ntorical perspective? Secondly, Wells asks a question that has preoccupied us ever since:\nwhat form of business and trade serves society best \u2013 streamlined mass-production\nconcentrated in big concerns, or small family businesses? Moreover, Wells poses\nspecifically the problem of franchise relationships and their ethical grounds. Thirdly,\nMANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY 2(3)\n244\n \u00a9 2007 SAGE Publications.

Fourthly, the novel culmi-\nnates with an extensive discussion of what we term today \u2018corporate social responsi-\nbility\u2019 problems; namely, with the question of redistribution of wealth and profit\nbetween different social groups \u2013 \u2018businessmen\u2019 and \u2018workers\u2019. Finally, Wells\u2019s style\nmoves the characters both in the sphere of immediate private life and personal con-\ncerns, and \u2013 explicitly \u2013 in the context of society in general and its future in the period\nbetween 1900 and 1914. Whilst we cannot review all the aspects of the novel here, it\nis a very appropriate resource to use as support for reflection upon these major topics\nof ethics in modern society. It can readily form the basis of a historically oriented\napproach to the study of business ethics, as we will try to show below.\nIn brief, the novel focuses upon the last years of the Harmans\u2019 marriage ending\nwith Sir Isaac\u2019s death. This period is characterized by Lady Harman\u2019s increasing recog-\nnition of her own condition. She gradually appreciates the complex ethical values\nwhich ground her status as a wife confined to a role of domestic subservience.\nMoreover, she realizes the predicament of her economic dependency upon her husband\nthat condemns her to political silence. Wells describes in detail her intense effort to\nunderstand and break out of these confines. He also discusses extensively her success-\nful attempt to force Sir Isaac to redirect part of his profits for the benefit of the com-\nmunity from which it originates. Sir Isaac\u2019s business is a growing bakery franchise\ncalled the International Bread and Cake Stores. Based in London, Sir Isaac\u2019s main effort\nis to expand his concerns by hostile takeovers of small bakers. The novel explicitly\ncovers the effects of dispossession, displacement, and marginalization accompanying\nhis large-scale expansion of a standardized store-chain whose modern expression is eas-\nily recognizable today in franchises such as Starbucks, Caff\u00e9 Nero, Costa Coffee, Pr\u00eat\n\u00c0 Manger, and so on. Against this accelerated accumulative success, Lady Harman\nexperiences the \u2018cold and bracing realization that all is not right with her position,\nwith Sir Isaac\u2019s business procedure and the world generally\u2026\u2019(1914, 124).\nThe plot is developed simply through three main characters, all seen through the\ncommentator\u2019s eyes (placed outside the story). The contours of the characters are set\ndown in linear succession. This makes reading very easy and allows concentration\nupon the details that make business, management practices, and the ethics of capital\naccumulation the central stage upon which human action takes place.\nThe novel employs the tragic form, as already pointed out, and deploys all the ele-\nments of the tragic unfolding of human destiny. Wells explores the painful recognitions\nof personal failures against the background of their value systems, as well as analysing the\nsentiment of suffering required by the imperative radical self-transformation, by the dra-\nmatic shattering of the apparent reliability of unconditional trust in, and blind following\nof traditions. This is the remarkable destiny of Lady Harman that the author bestows\nupon her. Equally remarkable is the clarity with which Wells inspects Sir Isaac\u2019s inabil-\nity to grasp his own ethical limits, to comprehend the damage his value system wreaks\non those who surround him. But, furthermore, the text exposes the fragility and unsustain-\nability of his arguments about his own position as the embodiment of the \u2018good\u2019 society\nCRUMP ET AL.:A HISTORICAL-CULTURAL APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF BUSINESS ETHICS \n245\n \u00a9 2007 SAGE Publications.

He dies without recognizing his own\nhistorical position and condition. Even in his death, he seeks to frame a legacy designed\nto perpetuate precisely the system of values that led to the dissolution of his personal life\nand whose limits he never understood. This is the fate not just of Sir Isaac. Wells brings\nto the fore the fact that all characters remain ensnared by modernity\u2019s specific dilemmas\ngrounded in its central paradox: the imperative of freedom, in tandem with a tight social\norder. This paradox turns out to be irresolvable and does not permit reconciliation.\nA third main character in the novel is crucial. He mediates the relationship between\nLady Harman and her husband, sharpening their contrast. But he is also used as a voice\nrepresenting, arguably, Wells\u2019s own views and personal dilemmas with the wider prob-\nlematic of Edwardian society on the eve of its great crisis (the First World War). Mr\nBrumley is a second-rate, but rather successful, writer of facile fiction. An interesting ele-\nment is his dissatisfaction with his own success, with the fact his works revolve around\nthe celebration of the bourgeoisie\u2019s self-confidence in its liberating and emancipatory role\nin history. As a middle-aged widower, he meets and falls in love with Lady Harman. He\nbegins to act as her devoted friend and advises her through the crises of her marriage\nbreakdown. He represents in specific ways Sir Isaac\u2019s opposite historical consciousness; he\nis the \u2018amiable though distinguished man of letters [facing] the great entrepreneur\u2019 (1914,\n34; original emphasis). As opposed to Sir Isaac, Brumley appears capable of appreciating\nhis personal and historical context. He seems able to move beyond his immediate and\nsimple comfort zone, to make sacrifices in order to keep Lady Harman safe from disgrace\nand disinheritance. But in the end, he is just as incapable to resolve his own ethical crises,\ndespite his knowledge and his willingness to make sacrifices.\nHence, all main characters live a typically modern tragedy. Brought into question\nby their own lives and by history, they cannot act resolutely in situations which they\nthemselves deem to be ethically critical. In Mr Brumley\u2019s final outburst,\n\u2018Of course I am absurd\u2019, he cried. \u2018All men are absurd. Man is the absurd\nanimal. We have parted from primordial motives \u2013 lust and hate and hunger\nand fear, and from all the tragic greatness of uncontrollable fate and we, we\u2019ve\ngot nothing to replace them. We are comic \u2013 comic! Ours is the stage of\ncomedy in life\u2019s history, half lit and blinded, \u2013 and we fumble.\u2019 (1914, 459)\nThe tragedy concludes by envisioning the disconcerting stage at which the modern mid-\ndle-class existence can no longer articulate its position in history, where it can no longer\nsustain its mode of life. As with other authors, in a prophetic turn, Wells\u2019s conclusion\nhaunts us, at the other end of the twentieth century, with similar predicaments.\nFrom \u2018Character\u2019 to \u2018Institution\u2019\nThat the novel entangles tragic destinies with personal breakdowns, with perma-\nnently unresolved crises, and, ultimately, with death, would not on its own make it a\nnovel about the historical importance of business ethics.

Her own emancipation from the traditional role of a silent, dependent, object-\nlike wife, has at its centre her recognition that her husband\u2019s conduct of business, how he\nmakes the money supposed to buy her obedience, as well as his corporation\u2019s impact upon\nthe society in which it operates, are fundamentally questionable. Lady Harman\u2019s crises\nframe the sequencing of the novel as she learns about Sir Isaac\u2019s character by increasing\nreflection on his business. She comprehends more and more clearly the unity of his ethi-\ncal matrix by reflecting upon his management style both in domestic and business affairs.\nShe realizes that his Taylorist-Fordist managerial rationality is not confined to his work\nbut that it configures his domestic mentality and conduct just as much:\nThe same exceptional aptitude of Sir Isaac for detailed administration that had\nrelieved his wife from the need of furnishing and arranging a home, made the birth\nof her children and the organization of her nursery an almost detached affair for\nher. Sir Isaac went about in a preoccupied way, whistling between his teeth and\nplanning with expert advice the equipment of an ideal nursery\u2026 (1914, 93\u201394)\nAt a dinner hosted for one of his business partners, Lady Harman realizes the common ground\nbetween Sir Isaac\u2019s scientific management of his home and that of his stores. Fascinated with\nand actively involved in a scientific management of F.W. Taylor\u2019s kind, at the table,\nHe compared notes with Charterson upon a speeding-up system for delivery vans\ninvented by an American and it made Blenker flush with admiration and turn as\nif for sympathy to Lady Harman to realize how a modification in a tail-board\nmight mean a yearly saving in wages of many thousand pounds. (1914, 200)\nThe Taylorist organization of business acts as the principal image of organizing fam-\nily life. For the modern entrepreneurial mentality, the ethics of business enters the\ndomus, the private home. Its entrance has a normalizing and neutralizing ethical effect.\nEfficiency and instrumentality seem to Sir Isaac to go beyond good and evil. The\n\u2018goodness\u2019 of efficiency appears as ethically self-sufficient.\nHe had something of an artist\u2019s passion in these things; he went about, a little\nbent and peaky, calculating and planning and hissing through his teeth, and\nfeeling not only that he was getting on, but that he was getting on in the\nmost exemplary way. Manifestly, anybody in his line of business who wanted\nto be leisurely, or to be generous, who possessed any broader interests than the\nshop, who troubled to think about the nation or the race or any of the deeper\nmysteries of life, was bound to go down before him. (1914, 96\u201397)\nIt is from a seamstress, Susan Burnet, that Lady Harman learns that her husband\u2019s\nbusiness is taking over all small bakeries in London (the metaphor of bread is central\nhere), that he destroys these family businesses and offers nothing in return.

She hadn\u2019t particularly analyzed this persuasion, but she\nsupposed him engaged in a kind of daily repetition, but upon modern\nscientific lines, of the miracle of loaves and fishes, feeding a great multitude\nthat would otherwise have gone hungry. (1914, 119)\nAs she grasps this reality, she endeavours to raise his awareness of the harm he is doing\nto the small bakers he puts out of business. But he retorts uncompromisingly:\n\u2018Progress is Progress, Elly. \u2026 You can\u2019t make a business without squeezing some-\nbody.\u2019 (1914, 121) In this the tragic nature of Sir Isaac\u2019s character is revealed: he\nbelieves blindly in the \u2018scientific\u2019 as something that stands outside \u2018morality\u2019 (as pure\nnovelty). He does not realize that this leads to his own estrangement from what he\nconsiders as most valuable: his wife. For Lady Harman, coming to terms with this\nreality is plain and painful:\nAnd the utmost resolution to believe in him could not hide from her for ever\nthe fact that his love manifested itself almost wholly as a parade of ownership\nand desire, without kindliness, without any self-forgetfulness. (1914, 105)\nIn this sense, Wells\u2019s work forms a rich supply of sources for reflection. He consciously\nbuilds and interconnects the personal dramas in the novel with institutional structures\nand mentalities that he saw as the genuine transformative agents of modern society. The\nfocus is not limited merely to the feminist emancipation movement, or the cause of\nthe Suffragettes; rather it is integrated with the wider social transformation generated\nby the rise of big corporations, entrepreneurialism and managerialism as forces shap-\ning the modern world.\nLady Harman\u2019s confrontation with her lifeworld is multifaceted. She is not sim-\nply trying to break the shackles of her marriage, but she also sees the myth of her hus-\nband\u2019s \u2018goodness\u2019 as a businessman at the forefront of the collapse of \u2018progress\u2019. The\nstory highlights in this dramatic turn Sir Isaac\u2019s business ethos. It is through this turn\nthat Lady Harman undergoes a radical transformation. She realizes that her position\nas a wife mirrors his view of his business assets:\nIndeed, he was inherently incapable of any vision beyond the express\nprohibitions and permissions of the rules of the games he played, or beyond\nthe laws and institutions under which he lived. His idea of generosity was the\nundocumented and unqualified purchase of a person by payments made in the\nform of a gift. (1914, 97)\nLady Harman\u2019s worldview undergoes a powerful reversal which is well documented in\nthe novel.

The Hostels emerge as an institutional counterpart to his\nstores. The ensuing confrontation between the two characters becomes one between\ninstitutions and foregrounds the system of values which was to govern the Hostels\n(called International Hostels, 1914, 360).\nFrom this point on, all characters, central and secondary (some of the girls\ninvolved, a certain Mrs. Pembrose, chosen by Sir Isaac as manager of the hostels, who\nwill eventually embody the values of rule-bound, tightly controlled institutionalism),\nrevolve around the dramatic antinomy Stores \u2013 Hostels. This drama develops into one\nwe would nowadays call a problem of \u2018corporate social responsibility\u2019. The amount of\ndetail Wells offers makes it a very rich opportunity to reflect upon the context of social\ntransformation brought about by business corporations, richer in many ways than any\ncase study could be. The tensions that emerge between characters in the process of\nbuilding up the hostels revolve around values of collective life, of sharing and of equi-\ntable distribution of burdens in society, of liberation and emancipation of women\nemployees through the Hostels as opposed to Sir Isaac\u2019s and Mrs. Pembrose\u2019s obses-\nsion with tight \u2018rules\u2019 governing and control of these Hostels. The novel moves well\nbeyond the immediate context of the Harmans\u2019 family life and their business con-\ncerns, and explores the much wider historical context of the first decade of the 20th\ncentury.\nAt this point, Wells touches upon, through Mr Brumley\u2019s character, some of the\nfundamental questions about modernity\u2019s reliance on business. Mr Brumley\u2019s musings\nupon the things he took for granted are used to examine Victorian and post-Victorian\nethical values embodied in the institutions of industrial capitalism:\nAnd these assumptions had had such an air then [1899] \u2013 of being quite\ntrustworthy, as being certain to wash and wear! Already nowadays [1909] it is\ndifficult to get them stated; they have become incredible while still too near to\njustify the incredibility that attaches to history. It was assumed, for example,\nthat in the institutions, customs and culture of the middle Victorian period,\nhumanity had... achieved its goal. There were of course still bad men and\nwomen \u2013 individually, \u2026 but all the main things were right, general ideas\nwere right; the law was right, institutions were right, Consols and British\nRailway Debentures were right and were going to keep right for ever. \u2026 for\nthe generality of humanity the phase of genial comedy had begun. There\nmight be improvements and refinements ahead, but social, political and\neconomic arrangements were now in their main outlines settled for good and\nall; nothing better was possible\u2026 (1914, 257\u2013258)2\nThese general comments about a societal scale of values on the brink of collapse are not,\nhowever, disconnected in the plot. On the contrary, the macro-social ethical commentary\nis thoroughly linked with the micro-personal one. Where Mr Brumley recognizes the end\nof a historical \u2018epoch\u2019, Sir Isaac does not; in fact, he is the very embodiment of its assump-\ntions.

He was no doubt acquisitive and retentive and\nmean-spirited, but these were merely the ugly aspects of a disposition that\ninvolved many other factors. He was also incurably a schemer. He liked to fit\nthings together, to dove-tail arrangements, to devise economies, to spread\ningeniously into new fields, he had a love of organization and contrivance as\ndisinterested as an artist\u2019s love for the possibilities of his medium. He would\nrather have made a profit of ten per cent out of a subtly planned shop than\nthirty by an unforeseen accident. He wouldn\u2019t have cheated to get money for\nthe world. He knew he was better at figuring out expenditures and receipts\nthan most people and he was as touchy about his reputation for this kind of\ncleverness as any poet or painter for his fame.

Why shouldn\u2019t he? He\nhad long observed with a certain envy the admirable advertisement such firms\nas Lever and Cadbury and Burroughs & Wellcome gained from their\nostentatiously able and generous treatment of their workpeople, and it seemed\nconceivable that in the end it might not be at all detrimental to his prosperity\nto put his hand to this long neglected piece of social work.

Not for commercial use or unauthorized distribution.\n at Lancaster University on October 24, 2007 http:\/\/moh.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nConcluding Remarks\nWe aim to add through this article a relatively new resource for the historical contex-\ntualization of business ethics. We have mentioned but a few of the major axes which\nframe Wells\u2019s literary exposition of major ethical issues in The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman.\nIn this \u2018marriage novel\u2019, Wells goes well beyond the strict problems of marriage itself\nand links the emancipation of women and other major social themes with the emer-\ngence of modern business corporations (Sir Isaac\u2019s stores can be easily compared with\nStarbucks and the like nowadays). Wells weaves in a novel what cannot be so easily\nmade visible in other forms of writing. He combines in form and style crises and\ntragic aspects of life that span and connect the entire micro\u2013macro social spectrum, he\nlinks themes not usually related in the analysis of the emergence of the ethos of busi-\nness, middle-class life, and modern social order.\nOur argument here, therefore, can be summarized along three major dimensions.\nFirst, we suggest that Wells\u2019s novel is a good heuristic source for historical reflection\nupon the constitution of systems of value in business organizations. Indeed, it is \u2018only\u2019\na work of fiction, but its precise historical contextualization and its pertinent critical\ncommentaries offer ample opportunity for the study of ethical themes in cultural con-\ntext. Moreover, Wells\u2019s narrative is historically interesting to the extent that it raises\nproblems which have not ceased to preoccupy us. The same dilemmas, doubts, prob-\nlems and conflicts have been present ever since. The problems posed by Wells in 1914\nare as valid a century later, if not even more intense in the wake of major corporate scan-\ndals, in the context of debates about the sustainability of mass-production and mass-\nconsumption cycles, and of the nature of the \u2018corporate social responsibility\u2019 agenda.\nSecond, we also aim to emphasize that ethics is bound up with the existential con-\ndition of being human in the world, that it is a product of our awareness of finitude,\nmortality and the meaning of time. Humans, as ethical-historical creatures, cannot\nplace their actions outside the sphere of history and ethics. Thus, reflection upon the\nethical hypostasis of human action (such as business and management, in our case)\nmust combine the personal (micro, or capillary) level of analysis with the societal and\ninstitutional (the macro) levels of historical dynamics. The modern novel allows us to\nsee these interconnections better than other textual forms of reflection.\nBy bringing the tragic form to the concreteness of everyday life, literature opens\nup new spaces for debate and understanding of the \u2018ethical\u2019 in relationship to business,\nmanagement, work, and society. The ethical frames the horizon of ordinary life, and\ncannot be relegated to some remote, \u2018special\u2019 agenda of institutional debate. Thus, in\na novel such as Wells\u2019s, it is seen \u2018close-up and personal\u2019; it is an elementary experi-\nence, perhaps the most elementary manifestation of our metaphysical awareness of\nfinitude and temporality. In tragic form, the ethical being of \u2018man\u2019 manifests itself in\ndoubts, upheavals and contestations which touch the everyday in manifold ways. The\n\u2018ethical\u2019 is bound up with the \u2018tragic\u2019 realization of our finitude; ethics is the account\nwe have to permanently give of our awareness of our mortality. Our aim is to empha-\nsize the personal as a primary element in the constitution of what we term ethos in\nCRUMP ET AL.:A HISTORICAL-CULTURAL APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF BUSINESS ETHICS \n251\n \u00a9 2007 SAGE Publications.

The history\nof business ethics emerges in Wells\u2019s novel more than as an \u2018object\u2019 to be contemplated\nexternally. The ethical and existential entanglements of the characters, institutions\nand their social situations come to life as subjective, \u2018lived experience\u2019, as a series of\nacute personal crises where history asks its subjects to question their condition. The\nvoice of history can be heard more acutely at a personal level when the major ethical\nquestions are asked in personal, existential terms. Thus, a close reading of such mate-\nrial can be seen as a rich ingredient in the academic study of \u2018business ethics\u2019.\nAs always, the extent to which the perspective upon society expressed in a novel\nis a piece of direct historical evidence is debatable. It is nonetheless possible to argue\nthat, as with all modern novels, it is not hard to situate such texts within their his-\ntorical context and to read them closely and critically as heuristic devices of research\nand teaching. Finally, it is also important to note that our own reading of Wells has\nbeen coloured by a particular theoretical angle. We have not had the space to discuss\nthe limitations of our own interpretation but it is crucial to highlight that any read-\ning of such material must always involve a self-critical evaluation of the reader\u2019s own\noriginal position. Our reading here is one amongst many possible, and it would be\ninteresting to explore comparatively other lines of interpretation.\nNotes\n1. The argument developed here significantly extends an earlier version published in the Journal of\nManagement History (Costea and Amiridis 2007). We benefited from the insights of the editor and\ntwo anonymous reviewers of that journal who helped us in pursuing the themes further. More\nspecifically, this version develops the earlier one in three respects. First, we have added an extended\nconceptual section which clarifies our perspective on the relationships between ethics, history, and\ntragedy as literary form. Second, we have emphasized more clearly how Wells\u2019s work can be used as\na teaching instrument. Thirdly, our concluding section has been significantly revised to accentuate\nthe new aspects in the paper.\n2.
