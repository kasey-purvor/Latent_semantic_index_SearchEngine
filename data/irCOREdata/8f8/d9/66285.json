Introduction\n[2] At low extents of melting (<20%), melts of the Earth\u2019s\nupper mantle are in equilibrium with a lherzolite assem-\nblage: olivine (ol), orthopyroxene (opx), clinopyroxene\n(cpx) and an aluminous phase (spinel, garnet, or plagio-\nclase). The melts produced are basaltic in composition and\nare the most voluminous form of terrestrial mafic magma-\ntism. The primary sites of basaltic volcanism are mid-ocean\nridges (MOR) where melting occurs in the spinel stability\nfield (1\u20133 GPa, Figure 1). As melting progresses, the first\nphase to be exhausted from the residue is cpx [e.g., Baker\nand Stolper, 1994]. Though spinel is still stable, it usually is\n<2% of the mass at the cpx-out point.\n[3] As melting approaches the cpx-out boundary, melt\nproduction rates (dF\/dT) rise, but once cpx is removed from\nthe residue, melt production rates drop dramatically\n[Asimow et al., 1997; Hirschmann et al., 1999]. This effect\nmay limit the upper bound of melting during adiabatic\ndecompression at mid-ocean ridges [Dick et al., 1984].\nPlume-related magmas, thought to be produced by hot\nupwellings, also show little evidence for progressing past\ncpx-out, though one unusually mafic Hawaiian picrite has\nbeen shown to be in equilibrium with a harzburgite (ol +\nopx) residue [Green et al., 2001; Wagner and Grove, 1998].\nAt present, mantle melting past cpx-out predominantly\noccurs when melting temperatures are lowered by hydrous\nfluids in subduction environments. This high-degree flux\nmelting produces a spectrum of silica-rich melts: andesites,\nbasaltic andesites and boninites (Figure 1). The high SiO2\ncontents have typically been attributed to the effect of H2O\non the activities of various melt species [Gaetani and\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 109, B02201, doi:10.1029\/2003JB002566, 2004\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/04\/2003JB002566$09.00\nB02201 1 of 20\nGrove, 1998]. However, to date, hydrous mantle melting\nexperiments have not produced high SiO2 melts, nor is there\nan existing numerical model that accurately predicts the\ncomposition of hydrous, mafic melts.\n[4] Pioneering experimental studies over the last three\ndecades have elucidated much about how melting occurs in\nthe mantle [Baker et al., 1995; Falloon and Green, 1987;\nFalloon et al., 1988; Hirose and Kushiro, 1993; Ito and\nKennedy, 1967; Jaques and Green, 1980; Kinzler, 1997;\nKinzler and Grove, 1992a, 1992b, 1993; Kushiro,\n1968; Presnall et al., 1979; Robinson et al., 1998; Stolper,\n1980; Takahashi et al., 1993; Walter, 1998]. These exper-\nimental studies of have typically focused on low-degree,\nanhydrous melting in an attempt to interpret MORB, and to\na lesser extent ocean island basalt, melting conditions.\nHydrous experimental data is less abundant [Asahara and\nOhtani, 2001; Falloon and Danyushevsky, 2000; Gaetani\nand Grove, 1998; Green, 1976; Hirose and Kawamoto,\n1995; Kawamoto et al., 1996; Kawamoto and Holloway,\n1997; Kushiro, 1968, 1972; Mysen and Boettcher, 1975].\nLikewise, many of the existing numerical models that\npredict mantle melting conditions are not valid after cpx\nexhaustion and\/or cannot incorporate the effects of H2O\n[Kinzler and Grove, 1992a; Mckenzie and Bickle, 1988; Niu\nand Batiza, 1991]. Of the existing models, only the MELTS\nprogram predicts hydrous ol-opx-melt equilibria. Yet\nMELTS was not intended specifically for this purpose,\nand the errors in estimated melt composition and equilibri-\num temperatures are substantial [Hirschmann et al., 1998b].\n[5] In this study, we present a series of hydrous and\nanhydrous experiments aimed at constraining the composi-\ntion of ol-opx saturated melts. The results are used to\ndiscuss the effect of H2O on the activities of melt species,\nSiO2 in particular. The experimental data, along with\nliterature data, are also used to construct a semiempirical,\npartitioning based predictive melting model. For a given\npressure, temperature and bulk composition (including H2O\ncontent), the model estimates melt, ol and opx phase\ncompositions as well as phase proportions. The model is\nprimarily aimed at predicting the composition of hydrous\nmelts in subduction zones, but can be applied to any melt\nthat leaves behind a harzburgite residue, including picrites\nand komatiites.\n2. Experimental Methods\n2.1. Starting Compositions\n[6] A primary goal of this study is to produce a numerical\nmodel that can predict the compositions of high-degree\nmantle melts based on experimentally produced mineral-\nmelt equilibria. To provide the most leverage for the linear\nregression models, the starting compositions were chosen to\nproduce ol-opx saturated melts over a wide range of P, T and\nH2O conditions, rather than choosing only natural melts\n(Table 1). The first composition (BK2) is based on a least\naltered Barberton komatiite. Except for Na2O, this is the\nsame composition studied by Parman et al. [1997]. The\nNa2O content of the original composition is too low to be in\nequilibrium with the clinopyroxene (cpx) found in the\nkomatiite samples, and so has been increased to be consis-\nFigure 1. Tectonic settings where mantle melting proceeds past the cpx-out boundary. Lightly stippled\nareas indicate melting of ol + opx + cpx + sp (lherzolite). Heavily stippled areas indicate melting of ol + opx\n\u00b1 sp (harzburgite). Arrows indicate direction of mantle flow. In subduction zones, after an initial depletion\nevent, hydrous melting often extends past cpx-out, producing magnesian andesites. Boninites record even\nhigher degrees of melting, and are associated with transient processes such as initiation of subduction [Stern\nand Bloomer, 1992]. Most plumes do not record evidence for melting past cpx-out. The most notable\nexceptions are the submarine glasses found on the flanks of the Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii [Clague et al.,\n1991]. These are the most mafic plume-related glasses known, and phase-equilibria experiments [Wagner\nand Grove, 1998] indicate that they left behind a harzburgite residue. Melting at mid-ocean ridges does not\nappear to melt past cpx-out, nor does melting associated with continental rifting.\nTable 1.

The second composition (W) is based upon a\nhydrous experimental melt in equilibrium with ol and opx\nreported by Gaetani and Grove [1998]. To promote satura-\ntion with harzburgite, the melt composition was reconsti-\ntuted by adding 15 wt % ol and 15 wt % opx. A third\ncomposition (W3) was formed by adding 25 wt % Fo90\nolivine to composition W. Both anhydrous and hydrous\nversions of these mixes were prepared. Hydrous mixes\ncontained between 5.0 and 6.5 wt % H2O (Table 2).\n[7] All of the experimental starting compositions were\nprepared by mixing high-purity oxides. Iron was added as\nboth Fe metal and Fe2O3 in the correct stoichiometric\nproportions to produce FeO. H2O was added as Mg(OH)2\n(brucite). The brucite was prepared by placing MgO and\nH2O in a pressure sealed Teflon beaker, which was placed\ninside an oven at 240\u0001C for 48 hours. Weighing of the\npowder before and after indicated that \u000196 wt % of the\nMgO was converted to Mg(OH)2. Anhydrous powders were\nconditioned at log fO2 = QFM-1 for 24 hours at 1000\u0001C.\nHydrous powders could not be conditioned in this way\nbecause the process would dehydrate the powders. Their\npreexperiment fO2 was set by the oxidation state of Fe in the\nmix, which was entirely FeO. During the experiment, the fO2\nwas governed by the equilibrium between FeO in the melt\nand Fe in the AuPd capsule (FeOmelt = Fecapsule + 1\/2O2\ngas)\n[Grove, 1981]. The capsule was saturated with Fe at QFM-1\nat 1 atm and activity calculations [Borisov and Palme,\n2000] indicate that this was also the fO2 imposed during\nthe experiment.\n2.2. Experimental Procedures\n[8] All experiments were performed in piston-cylinder\ndevices at MIT using the hot piston in technique. Pressures\nfor all devices have been calibrated to the Ca-Tschermakite\n(CATS) breakdown boundary [Hays, 1967], and pressures\nare considered accurate to 0.05 GPa. Temperature was\nmeasured with a W\/Re thermocouple. The temperature\ngradient across the sample is estimated to be less than\n10\u0001C. For anhydrous experiments, sample powders were\npacked into graphite capsules. These were then placed into\nPt capsules and welded shut. Hydrous sample powders were\nplaced in Au80Pd20 capsules and welded shut [Gaetani and\nGrove, 1998]. These capsules were placed inside graphite\ncapsules machined from graphite rod stock (Figure 2). In\nsome experiments, the graphite outer capsule was replaced\nwith MgO, with the result that \u000150 wt % of the H2O\ndiffused out of the sample. With the graphite capsules,\ntypical H2O losses were 0\u201310 wt %, suggesting that the\ngraphite is an effective barrier to H diffusion. The Au80Pd20\ncapsules were preconditioned with Fe before the high-\npressure experiments. This was done by filling them with\nan andesite composition and placing them in a 1 atm\nfurnace at log fO2 = QFM-1 and 1250\u0001C for 72 hours.\nThe silicate glass was then removed with a HF + nitric acid\nmixture. Fluoride residues after HF dissolution were first\nremoved manually with a pick and then by soaking in HCl.\nThe conditions and results of each experiment are given in\nTable 2.\n3.

A 2 mm beam diameter was used for solid phases,\na 20 mm beam for glass, and a 30 mm beam for\n\u2018\u2018unquenched\u2019\u2019 melt. The term \u2018\u2018unquenched\u2019\u2019 refers to\nmelts that do not quench to a glass, but instead form a\nmatrix of lathe shaped pyroxene with interstitial evolved\nmelt. Because of the high MgO and H2O contents of the\nmelts studied here, and the high pressure and temperature of\nthe experiments, the melts in only six of the hydrous\nexperiments quenched to glass (W.7, W.9, W.10, W.12,\nW3.31, W3.34). Unquenched melts are typically analyzed\nby using a defocused beam or by rastering the beam of the\nmicroprobe. We have also followed this method. For each\nunquenched melt, we perform 30\u201340 analyses with the\ndefocused beam. In two experiments, half of the melt\nquenched to glass and the other half did not. Analyses of\nboth sides agree within error for all elements except Al2O3,\nwhich is slightly overestimated in the unquenched melt. In\nexperiments BK2.19 and BK2.20 the melt and crystals were\nsegregated enough to separate the quench growth from the\ncrystals physically. The unquenched melt was placed in a Pt\ncapsule and remelted in a 1 ATM furnace under air at\n1300\u0001C for \u000120 min. The high fO2 prevents Fe loss to the\nPt. These remelts were quenched into water and formed\n100% glass. In both cases, the remelted glass composition\nwas within the errors of the quench growth analyses, except\nfor Al2O3. The compositions of all experimental products\nare given in Table 3. H2O contents of melts that did not\nquench to glass were calculated using the phase proportion\nof the melt and the bulk H2O content of the starting\ncomposition.\n4. Results\n4.1. Attainment of Equilibrium\n[10] The experiments reported here are all synthesis\nexperiments. No reversals have been performed. Although\nequilibrium has not been proven, it can be assessed by a\nnumber of means.\n[11] 1. Loss or gain of mass to the enclosing capsule\nduring the experiment inhibits equilibrium. All of our\nexperiments have been mass balanced. Of the 22 experi-\nments reported, all but 6 have sum of squared residuals\n(\u0001r2) less than 0.25, indicating no significant diffusional\nexchange with the AuPd capsule. The remaining six clearly\nlost\/gained Fe to the capsule. When FeO is left out of the\nmass balance, the sum r2 for all six are below 0.1.\n[12] 2. The Fe\/Mg partitioning between olivine and melt,\nand between opx and melt are relatively independent of\npressure and temperature. For magnesian-rich, alkali-poor\nmelts, ol-melt KD\nFe-Mg should be 0.33 \u00b1 0.03 and opx-melt\nKD\nFe-Mg should be 0.32 \u00b1 0.03. Only experiments with KD\nvalues within these ranges have been accepted. The six\nexperiments with poor mass balances were included in the\ndata set based on their acceptable KD values, which suggest\nthat Fe exchange with the capsule occurred early enough in\nthe experiment for the solid phases to reequilibrate with the\nmelt.\n[13] 3. Experimental phases should be unzoned if they are\nin complete equilibrium. In reality, some zoning always\npersists, but only experiments where the zoning is small are\naccepted. The elements most likely to be lost are FeO and\nH2O: FeO because it is soluble in the AuPd capsules of the\nhydrous experiments and H2O because H atoms can rapidly\ndiffuse through most materials. In practice, it is relatively\neasy to see when an experiment has been significantly\naffected by one of these mechanisms. FeO loss or gain shows\nup as strong FeO zoning in both ol and opx that is apparent in\nbackscattered electron imaging. H2O loss is apparent because\nof the strong effect it has on melting temperature. Experi-\nments that lose H2O are significantly more crystalline than\nsuccessful hydrous experiments at the same conditions, and\noften have no melt present. In general, the high temperatures\nand\/or high H2O contents of the experiments, along with the\nrelatively fast diffusion rates in ol and opx promote equilib-\nrium. The excellent coherence of the experimental data\n(described below) is additional circumstantial evidence that\nequilibrium has been closely approached.\n4.2. Phase Diagrams\n[14] The anhydrous and H2O-undersaturated phase dia-\ngrams for BK and W are shown in Figure 3. In addition,\nthe melting point of Fe-conditioned Au80Pd20 is shown in\nFigure 2. Experimental assemblies used in this study. For\nanhydrous experiments, the sample was placed in a graphite\ncapsule, which was placed inside a Pt capsule and welded\nshut. For hydrous experiments, the sample was contained in\nan Au80Pd20 capsule presaturated with Fe [Gaetani and\nGrove, 1998].

A few hydrous experiments were performed in\nunconditioned capsule to extend the hydrous experiments to\nhigher temperatures (experiments above the Fe-saturated\nAu80Pd20 melting line). While the Fe loss was too great to\nallow them to be used in the chemical modeling, they have\nbeen used to place additional constraints on the phase\nboundaries. Because of the Fe loss, we have not included\nthese experiments in Table 2 or 3. The data are available upon\nrequest.\n[15] Under anhydrous conditions, olivine is on the\nliquidus of composition BK2 up to \u00011.5 GPa and\n1500\u0001C. At which point, opx becomes the liquidus phase.\nThe exact multiple saturation point is not bracketed, but the\nexperiment (BK2.24) at 1.5 GPa is quite close to the\nliquidus (83% melt) and is saturated with both ol (9%)\nand opx (7%). As opx enters the melt in greater proportion,\nthe multiple saturation point should be at slightly higher\npressure and temperature than the experiment.\n[16] With 5 wt % H2O in the BK2 bulk composition, the\nphase boundary for ol is lowered by \u0001100\u0001C at 1.5 GPa,\ndecreasing to 50\u0001C at 2.4 GPa. The slope of the ol phase\nboundary is slightly greater than the slope of the Au80Pd20\nmelting point, limiting the pressures at which ol-opx satu-\nrated melts could be produced to less than 2.6 GPa. The opx\nphase boundary is lowered by over 200\u0001C, causing the\nol-opx saturation point to move to higher pressure and\nlower temperature (\u00012.3 GPa and 1450\u0001C), relative to\nanhydrous conditions. Cpx becomes a stable phase 100\u0001C\nbelow the opx phase boundary.\n[17] Under anhydrous conditions, ol is on the liquidus of\ncomposition W until \u00011.3 GPa, after which opx is on the\nliquidus. The multiple saturation point is at \u00011350\u0001C,\nthough this is not well bracketed. The first appearance of\ncpx is 50\u0001C below the opx phase boundary.

Melt Reactions\n[18] Pairs of experiments separated by 50\u0001C or less have\nbeen used to estimate melting reactions (Table 4). Both wet\nand dry experiments show that opx dominates the solid input\nto the melt. For compositions BK2 and W, the ratio of opx to\nol entering the melt is \u00014:1. For composition W3, the\nmelting is incongruent and ol is produced. H2O appears to\nhave little effect on the melting coefficients, as both wet and\ndry W3 experiments have very similar coefficients for both\nol and opx.\n4.4. Mineral\/Melt Partitioning\n[19] The effect of water on phase equilibria can be\nevaluated by examining the mineral\/melt partition coeffi-\ncients (D). At equilibrium,\nmia \u00bc mib \u00f01\u00de\nmi;0a \u00fe RT ln aia \u00bc mi;0b \u00fe RT ln aib \u00f02\u00de\nwhere ma\ni is the chemical potential of component i in phase a,\nma\ni,0 is the standard state chemical potential, R is the gas\nconstant, T is temperature, and aa\ni is the activity of component\ni in phase a. Activity is related to composition by\naia \u00bc giaxia; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere xa\ni is mole fraction and ga\ni is the activity coefficient\nof component i in phase a. Substituting equation (3) into\nequation (2), and solving for the solid\/melt D value yields\nlnDsolid=melt \u00bc \u0002ma\u0002bi =RT \u00fe ln gib=gia\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere D is the ratio of the mole percent of an element in the\nsolid to its mole percent in the melt. If mixing of an element\nin the crystal and melt follows Raoult\u2019s law (g = 1) or\nHenry\u2019s law (g = constant), then plots of ln D versus 1\/T\nshould produce straight lines. Conservative single cation\noxide components (e.g., MgO, AlO1.5, HO0.5) are used in all\nregressions.\n[20] For FeO and MgO in both ol and opx, ln D shows an\nexcellent correlation with 1\/T, suggesting that the activity\ncoefficients for these elements are nearly constant. The data\nfor opx are shown in Figure 4. No difference is seen\nbetween the hydrous and anhydrous experiments, implying\nthat H2O has little effect on the activity coefficients of FeO\nand MgO in the liquid. Neither is there a difference between\nexperiments with different starting compositions, as all of\nthe data fall on the same lines. The tightness of the lines is a\ngood indication that the experiments have closely\napproached equilibrium, while the parallel slopes of the\nFeO and MgO lines for both ol and opx indicate that near\nconstant Fe\/Mg KD have been maintained. Previous studies\n[Gaetani and Grove, 1998] have observed similar system-\natics in ol-opx-cpx saturated melts.\n[21] The D values for SiO2 do not display Arrehnius\nrelationships in either ol or opx (Figure 5a). D SiO2 for both\nol and opx are distinctly higher when H2O is present.\nFigure 3.

Thick dashed lines indicate phase boundaries that\nare not bracketed by experiments but inferred using the\nphase proportions of the nearest experiments.

Unsaturated Au80Pd20 capsules were used for\nhydrous experiments above this line and are only used here\nto infer phase relations. Note the large effect of H2O to\nlower the temperature of the opx boundary (\u0001200\u0001C) versus\nthe smaller (\u0001100\u0001C) drop in the ol-out boundary. Because\nof the different slopes of the two boundaries, this results in\nthe melt + ol + opx liquidus saturation point moving to\nhigher pressures and lower temperatures in the hydrous\nexperiments.\nB02201 PARMAN AND GROVE: HARZBURGITE MELTING\n7 of 20\nB02201\nFigure 4.

This suggests\nthat H2O is not mixing with SiO2 in the same manner as with\nMgO and FeO. Following Bottinga [1972], Drake [1976]\nproposed a two-lattice model for melts in which the network\nforming melt species (SiO2, CaAl2O4, NaAlO2, etc.) and\nnetwork modifiers (MgO, FeO, CaO, etc.) form separate\nlattice sites. Species of the same type mix nearly ideally, but\nmixing does not occur between the two lattice sites. The\npartitioning data indicate that H2O is mixing nearly ideally\nwith the network modifiers, producing the Arrehnius rela-\ntionships for MgO and FeO (Figure 4), but is not mixing with\nSiO2 on the network-forming lattice site. Assuming H2O\ndoes mix on the SiO2 lattice site (Figure 5a) produces\nartificial breaks between the hydrous and anhydrous parti-\ntioning data. It also produces a somewhat misleading corre-\nlation between H2O and SiO2 partitioning (Figure 5b).\n4.5. H2O Speciation\n[22] The speciation of H2O in the melt can be examined\nwith the partitioning data. Burnham [1975] proposed that the\nlinear relationship between the fugacity of H2O and the\nsquare of the H2O concentration in experimental melts\nimplies that all H2O is dissolved as OH in silicate melts.\nStolper demonstrated that silicate glasses contained signifi-\ncant amounts of molecular H2O [Stolper, 1982a, 1982b]. He\nproposed that the OH\/H2O ratios in the glasses were indic-\native of the ratios in the melts from which they were\nquenched and also that this speciation could also produce\nthe observed relationship between H2O fugacity and concen-\ntration. Subsequent in situ analyses of H2O speciation in\nmelts have determined H2O speciation in melts directly.\nThese studies show a steep temperature dependence to the\nOH\/H2O ratio [Ihinger et al., 1999; Shen and Keppler, 1995;\nWithers et al., 1999]. Extrapolation of these observed OH\/\nH2O ratios to the temperature of our mantle melting experi-\nments indicates that nearly all H2O should be present as OH.\nThe high molecular H2O in rhyolitic glasses records the\nspeciation of H2O of the melt at the glass transition, which\noccurs at low (600\u2013700\u0001C) temperatures [Dingwell and\nWebb, 1990].\n[23] When the experimentally determined D values for the\nnetwork modifiers are calculated assuming all H2O as HO0.5,\nlinear trends are observed for MgO and FeO partitioning\n(Figure 4). When treated as all molecular H2O, a distinct\nbreak occurs between the hydrous and anhydrous data. The\nsame break occurs in ol-opx-cpx saturated partitioning data\n[Gaetani and Grove, 1998, Figure 5]. In addition, a slightly\nbetter linear correlation is found between D SiO2 and H2O\nconcentration (Figure 5b) when H2O is treated as predomi-\nnantly dissociated instead of molecular. The partitioning data\ncorroborate Burnham\u2019s model and in situ observations that\nH2O predominantly dissolves as OH at high temperatures.\n5. Activity of Silica in Hydrous Melts\n5.1. Temperature and Compositional Effects\n[24] The activity of silica in ol-opx saturated melts is\ncontrolled by the reaction:\nSiOmelt2 \u00feMg2SiOol4 \u00bc Mg2Si2Oopx6 \u00f05\u00de\nand activity values can be calculated using\n\u0002Go \u00bc RT lnK \u00bc RT ln aopxen = ameltSiO2*aolfo\n\u0001 \u0002\u0003 \u0004 \u00f06\u00de\nwhere \u0002Go is the difference in standard state energies\nbetween the product and reactants, R is the gas constant, T is\ntemperature (in kelvin), aen\nopx is the activity of clinoenstatite\nin orthopyroxene, aSiO2\nmelt is the activity of SiO2 in the melt,\nand afo\nol is the activity of forsterite in olivine. The MELTs\nsupplemental calculator [Asimow and Ghiorso, 1998;\nGhiorso and Sack, 1995] has been used to calculate these\nvalues for the experimentally produced ol, opx, and melts in\nthis study as well as from the literature [Gaetani and Grove,\n1998; Hesse and Grove, 2002; Kinzler, 1997; Parman et al.,\n1997; Walter, 1998].\n[25] The largest effect on gSiO2\nmelt is the MgO and SiO2\ncontent of the melt (Figure 6a). The three compositions used\nin this study and those used by Gaetani and Grove [1998]\nproduce well separated trends with slopes that are identical\nwithin the associated errors. The values for ln gSiO2\nmelt for the\nmost MgO-rich composition (BK2) approach the value of\n\u00010.45 for a pure MgO-SiO2 liquid saturated with ol and opx\n[Ryerson, 1985]. Alkalis, aluminates and other melt com-\nposition parameters affect gSiO2\nmelt as well [Hirschmann et al.,\n1998a], but these effects are small relative to the effects of\nMgO and SiO2 in this data set, especially the highly mafic\ncompositions. Some of the scatter about the trends in Figure\n6 may be the result of variations in these melt compositional\nparameters.\n[26] Inverse temperature correlates with ln gSiO2\nmelt\n(Figure 6a), but has the opposite slope from that derived\nfrom thermodynamic properties [Ryerson, 1985]. In fact, the\ntrend in Figure 6a is due to the correlation between\nequilibrium temperature and the H2O content of the melt.\nWhen plotted against H2O content, the correlation with ln\ngSiO2\nmelt is improved (Figure 6b). The activity coefficients\nwere calculated assuming simple melt components, such\nthat the higher the H2O content of the melt, the lower the\nSiO2 concentration becomes. Yet if Drake [1976] is correct\nand network modifiers such as H2O do not mix with\nnetwork formers such as SiO2, then the activity coefficient\nof SiO2 should be independent of the H2O content of the\nmelt. This can be tested by removing H2O from the melt and\nrecalculating the activity coefficients (Figure 6c). When this\nis done, the data again form parallel trends versus inverse\ntemperature, but unlike in Figure 6a, they agree precisely\nwith the predicted temperature dependence of gSiO2\nmelt\n[Ryerson, 1985]. While not a fully thermodynamic analysis,\nthe correlation indicates that the primary effect of H2O on\nsilica activity coefficients is thermal and that correlations\nwith melt H2O content are the result of the melt components\nchosen.\n[27] Pressure causes gSiO2\nmelt to decrease slightly (Figure 6).\nThe effect does not appear to be linear. The difference\nbetween melts at 2.0 GPa and 1.5\u20131.6 GPa is barely\ndetectable while the change from 1.6 to 1.2 GPa in the\nGaetani and Grove experiments is significantly larger. The\ndecreasing effect at higher pressures is consistent with\nthermodynamic expressions for the pressure dependence\nof silica activity [Carmichael, 2002].\n[28] Apparent relationships between the activity coeffi-\ncient of silica and melt composition can be produced if the\nB02201 PARMAN AND GROVE: HARZBURGITE MELTING\n9 of 20\nB02201\neffects of H2O, temperature and pressure are not addressed.\nFor instance, Carmichael [2002] has proposed that RT ln\ngSiO2\nmelt increases as MgO decreases. This is opposite of the\ngeneral conception that ideality should be approached as\nmelts become more mafic and the equilibrium temperatures\nrise (Figure 6). In fact, the correlation found by Carmichael\nis the result of comparing high-MgO melts produced at\n1.2\u20132.0 GPa with low-MgO melts produced at much lower\nexperimental pressures (Figure 7). The mafic melts have\nlower RT ln gSiO2\nmelt in large part because they are at higher\npressures, not because of their higher MgO contents. By\ncomparing experiments at the same pressures, it is evident\nthat RT ln gSiO2\nmelt does increase with MgO content as\nexpected (Figure 7a).\n[29] Similarly, Carmichael proposed that RT ln gSiO2\nmelt\nincreases with increasing Na2O + K2O concentration in\nthe melt [Carmichael, 2002], opposite what previous studies\nhave found [Hirschmann et al., 1998a]. When melts with\nNa2O + K2O < 0.25 are compared, the expected negative\ncorrelation is found between alkalis and RT ln gSiO2\nmelt\n(Figure 7b). Experiments with Na2O + K2O > 0.25 do not\nfall on this trend and are offset to higher RT ln gSiO2\nmelt ,\napparently reversing the trend seen in the lower alkali melts.\nMore experiments with high alkali melts are needed to\nconstrain these trends better, but it does appear that for\nhigh alkali melts, RT ln gSiO2\nmelt increases with alkalis.\nHowever, for the majority of mantle melts (with Na2O +\nK2O < 0.25), the opposite trend applies.\n5.2. Origin of High SiO2 in Hydrous Melts\n[30] It is a long-standing observation that hydrous mag-\nmas are silica-rich relative to anhydrous magmas, and so\nhydrous subduction-related magmas are quartz-normative\n(andesitic) while anhydrous mid-ocean ridge magmas are\nolivine-hypersthene to nepheline normative (basaltic) [Gill,\n1981]. This is typically attributed to the depolymerization of\nSiO2 chains in the melt, which stabilize depolymerized\northosilicate components such as olivine, over chain or\nframework silicate melt components, in which the SiO2\ntetrahedra are more linked [Kushiro, 1972]. The expansion\nof the olivine stability field causes the melts to become\nmore silica-rich. However, hydrous experiments, including\nthose in this study, have failed to produce melts with high\nenough SiO2 to reproduce andesite compositions, when the\nmelts are compared on a volatile-free basis. When H2O is\nleft in the melt composition, there is little shift of the ol-opx\nboundary and there is no increase of SiO2 in the hydrous\nFigure 6. Activity coefficients for hydrous and anhydrous\nexperimental melts in equilibrium with ol and opx from this\nstudy and from literature data [Gaetani and Grove, 1998;\nKinzler, 1997]. (a) Activity coefficient versus inverse\ntemperature. The experimental compositions G&G98 (cir-\ncles, open for 1.2 GPa, solid for 1.6 GPa, and gray for 2.0\nGPa), W (squares, open for 1.5 GPa and solid for 2.0 GPa)\nand BK2 (triangles, open for 1.5 GPa and solid for 2.2 GPa)\nproduce separate trends with the same slope. High-pressure\nexperiments (>1.6 GPa) consistently have lower activity\ncoefficient values than lower-pressure (<1.6 GPa) data,\nproviding evidence for a pressure effect. Anhydrous\nexperiments of Kinzler and Grove [1992a] at 1.2 GPa\nshown as a cross. These data were used by Gaetani and\nGrove [1998] to deduce the effect of temperature on silica\nactivity coefficients. (b) Activity coefficient versus melt\nH2O content. The correlations are slightly better than\nagainst 1\/T, and the difference between the high- and low-\npressure experiments is clearer. (c) Activity of silica\ncorrected for dilution by H2O versus inverse temperature.\nLines indicate theoretical temperature dependence of silica\nactivity coefficient [Ryerson, 1985].\nB02201 PARMAN AND GROVE: HARZBURGITE MELTING\n10 of 20\nB02201\nmelts [Gaetani and Grove, 1998]. The apparent expansion\nof the olivine stability field is a result of comparing melts on\nan anhydrous basis. The question then remains, if H2O does\nnot increase the SiO2 content of mantle melts, then why are\nsubduction zone magmas andesitic?\n[31] The analysis of the effects of H2O on silica activity\ncoefficients described above offers a potential explanation.\nWhen compared on an anhydrous basis, gSiO2\nmelt varies only\nslightly with temperature (Figure 6c). Likewise, mineral-\nmelt partition coefficients for SiO2 vary little when com-\npared on an anhydrous basis (Figure 8). This is the essential\neffect of ol and opx buffering the activity of SiO2. The\npartition coefficient for MgO, on the other hand, changes\ntremendously over the same temperature range (Figure 8),\nas the activity of MgO is not buffered. Therefore, at low\ntemperatures, the concentration of MgO (and FeO)\ndecreases in the melt while the concentration of SiO2 is\nmaintained by the ol-opx buffer (by dissolving opx and\nprecipitating ol). The overall effect is to increase the SiO2\/\n(MgO + FeO) ratio in the melt at low temperatures.\n[32] The failure of experiments to reproduce the high\nSiO2 contents of subduction-related andesites may be be-\ncause they were performed at higher temperatures than\nthose at which most andesites last equilibrated with the\nmantle. Most hydrous mantle melting experiments have\ncontained 3\u20137 wt % H2O and have been run at temperatures\nabove 1200\u0001C, producing melts with 49\u201352 wt % SiO2\n(anhydrous basis). These results have reproduced the com-\npositions of basaltic andesites with <54 wt % SiO2 [Baker et\nal., 1994]. The higher SiO2 contents of mafic andesites (>6\nwt % MgO, >54 wt % SiO2) may indicate equilibration at\nlower temperatures (1000\u20131100\u0001C) and higher H2O (>7 wt\n%) contents than existing experiments. Some petrologic\nstudies of andesitic magmas have concluded that H2O\ncontents >7 wt % are required to produce some andesitic\nmagma compositions [Anderson, 1974; Carmichael, 2002;\nGrove et al., 2003]. The high SiO2 characteristic of sub-\nduction magmas may reflect the overall lower equilibration\ntemperatures of hydrous magmas, relative to anhydrous\nmagmas with otherwise similar compositions. It also sug-\nFigure 7.

The hydrous and anhydrous data at 1\u20132 GPa\nlargely overlap, indicating that there is little correlation\nbetween H2O and alkalis. While the 3 GPa data [Walter,\n1998] have lower RT ln gSiO2\nmelt than the 1\u20132 GPa data,\nthe 0.2 GPa komatiite data [Parman et al., 1997] overlap the\n1\u20132 GPa data. The alkali-rich experiments at both high-\n[Hesse and Grove, 2002] and low-pressure [Carmichael,\n2002] show slightly elevated RT ln gSiO2\nmelt .\nFigure 8. Mineral melt partition coefficients (D) for opx in\nhydrous (open symbols) and anhydrous (solid symbols) for\nSiO2 (circles) and MgO (squares). The partition coefficients\nhave been recalculated on an anhydrous basis to remove the\neffects of dilution by H2O (see text). The partition\ncoefficient for MgO and SiO2 diverge at low temperatures,\ncausing a rise in the SiO2\/MgO ratio of the melts.\nB02201 PARMAN AND GROVE: HARZBURGITE MELTING\n11 of 20\nB02201\ngests that H2O contents in subduction related magmas\nmay be far higher than is commonly accepted. In the\nfollowing section, we present a partitioning based model\nthat predicts melt compositions and corroborates the con-\nclusion that high H2O contents (>7 wt %) are required to\nproduce many andesites.\n6. Melting Model\n6.1. Theory\n[33] The relatively well behaved element partitioning in\nhigh-degree melts can be used to advantage in constructing\na predictive melting model [Weaver and Langmuir, 1990].\nThree equations constrain the composition and weight\nproportions of phases in equilibrium with each other. The\nfirst is mass balance, which states that the mass of an\nelement in each phase must sum to the mass of that element\nin the bulk composition:\nX\nj\nnjx\ni\nj \u00bc xibulk \u00f07\u00de\nwhere nj is the weight fraction of phase j, xj\ni is the weight\npercent of element i in phase j, and xbulk\ni is the weight\npercent of i in the bulk composition. The second constraint\nis that each phase must be stoichiometric:\nX\ni\nxij \u00bc 1 \u00f08\u00de\nwhere the summation is over all elements i in phase j.\n[34] The third constraint is the equilibrium condition\ngiven in equation (1), stating that the partial molar Gibb\u2019s\nfree energy of two phases in equilibrium must be equal.\nEquation (4) recasts this constraint in terms of mineral\/melt\npartition coefficients (D) and gives the temperature depen-\ndence. Pressure and compositional terms can be included\n[e.g., Ulmer, 1989] to yield\nlnD \u00bc a\u00fe b=T \u00fe cP \u00fe dH2Omelt \u00f09\u00de\nwhere D is the molar partition coefficient, T is temperature,\nP is pressure and H2O\nmelt is the H2O content of the melt.\nWhen the bulk composition of the system is prescribed,\nequations (7), (8), and (9) leave only two independent\nvariables. For modeling purposes, we have chosen these\ntwo variables to be pressure and temperature.\n6.2. Parameterization of Partition Coefficients\n[35] The core of the model (from here on referred to as\nHARZ) is the parameterization of the ol\/melt and opx\/melt\nD values. The values of the constants in equation (9) have\nbeen obtained using linear regression using P, 1\/T, and melt\ncomposition as the independent variables (Table 5).\n[36] We have sought to find the minimum number of\nparameters that describe the partitioning. For the majority of\noxides, using only the 1\/T parameter yields the most\nsignificant fit with the smallest errors on the fit parameters.\nAdding more parameters increases the R2, but significantly\nlowers the significance F. SiO2 partitioning is mostly\ncontrolled by H2O content, but a small temperature or\npressure term is also statistically significant. Using both P\nand T in the regression yielded a low significance, likely\nbecause P and T are highly correlated in experimental data\nsets. The fit using P and H2O gave slightly better statistics\nand is the one used in the model. AlO1.5 in opx was also\nfound to have a slightly better fit to P and H2O than to 1\/T.\n[37] The linear fits are of varying quality. Those for SiO2,\nMgO, and FeO in both ol and opx are excellent and\nsignificant at the 0.005 level or better (Figure 9a). AlO1.5\nand MnO in ol and CrO1.5 and MnO and NaO0.5 in opx are\nintermediate and are significant at the 0.01 level (Figure 9b).\nTiO2, AlO1.5, and CaO have poor fits in opx and are only\nsignificant at the 0.25 level (Figure 9c). TiO2, CrO1.5, and\nCaO have poor fits in olivine, but as they are minor\nelements in olivine, this has little effect on the model.\n[38] To expand the P-T composition range of the fits, the\nexperimental data from the current study were combined\nwith literature data [Baker and Stolper, 1994; Gaetani and\nGrove, 1998; Hirose and Kawamoto, 1995; Kinzler, 1997;\nWalter, 1998]. The literature data were filtered in the\nfollowing manner. First, all experiments with Fe-Mg KD\nfor ol and opx that fall outside of the equilibrium values for\nalkali-poor compositions (0.33 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.32 \u00b1 0.03,\nrespectively) were removed. Then each experimental parti-\ntioning data set was checked for consistency with the\ncurrent data set and other literature data sets. Clear outliers\nwere removed. Given the simplicity and semiempirical\nnature of the model, our initial intention was only to include\nmelts saturated with ol and opx. Including the current study,\nthere are only 30 such experiments for which both melt and\nmineral compositions are available. To increase the data set,\nol-opx-cpx-saturated melts were included. Theoretically, the\nol-opx-melt partitioning systematics should not be affected\nby the presence of cpx. On the other hand, the lherzolite-\nsaturated melts generally have higher CaO, Na2O, and\nAl2O3 contents. Aluminate melt species have been shown\nto have a significant effect on ol and opx partitioning\n[Hirschmann et al., 1998a]. The simplicity of the current\nTable 5.

Nevertheless, the\naddition of 50 ol-opx-cpx saturated melts improved the\nlinear regressions of the partitioning data. A total of 81\nexperiments are included in the data set. The only major\nexperimental study that was not included was that of Falloon\nand Danyushevsky [2000]. Inclusion of this study caused a\nsignificant decrease in the quality of the linear regressions.\nWe do not know the reason for this, though we note that\nthe hydrous experiments of Falloon and Danyushevsky were\nperformed in carbon capsules, whereas the other hydrous\nexperiments were performed in metal capsules.\n7. Model Results\n7.1. Comparison of Predicted Phase Equilibria With\nExperimental Data\n[39] The Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the\nsystem of equations (7)\u2013(9). The P, T, and bulk composition\nof the system are set, as is an initial guess at the melt\ncomposition. The P, T, and melt H2O are used to calculate a\nset of ol\/melt and opx\/melt D values. The system of\nequations is iteratively solved until a minimum level of\nconvergence is reached for all values (0.01% relative,\nusually requiring less than 20 iterations). A new set of D\nvalues is calculated at each step. When the entered pressure-\ntemperature conditions are outside of the stability field of\neither ol or opx, the model does not converge on positive\nvalues for the phase percentages of ol, opx and melt. For a\ngiven P and bulk composition, the lowest temperature for\nwhich the model converges is taken as the cpx-out point,\nwhile the highest temperature where the model converges is\ntaken as the opx-out point.\n[40] The first test of the model is how well it reproduces\nthe data included in the database (i.e., the interpolation\naccuracy of the model). Figure 10 compares the HARZ\noutput with the experiments of Walter [1998]. The agree-\nment is excellent. Phase proportions are generally within 0.1\nor better. Temperature accuracy can be judged by noting the\npoint where ol and melt have equal fractions. This is\npredicted within 40\u0001C by the model. The slope of the melt\nfraction curve (dF\/dT = melt productivity) is 0.0016\/\u0001C,\nconsistent with previous studies that argue for a low dF\/dT\nafter the exhaustion of cpx from the residue [Hirschmann et\nal., 1999]. Even quite subtle aspects are recovered. From\ntheory [Asimow et al., 1997], it is expected that dF\/dT will\nrise as melting approaches the exhaustion of a phase. This\nresults in a concave up curve of F versus T. This is present\nin the HARZ predictions and in the Walter data (Figure 10).\nNote that no phase fraction information is provided to the\nmodel, only partitioning data.\n[41] Another test of accuracy is to compare the predic-\ntions with data not included in the HARZ data set. For this\npurpose the data of Falloon and Danyushevsky [2000] are\ncompared to the model predictions in Figure 11. In that\nstudy, the starting composition for the experiments was\nvaried for each run by adding various proportions of\nboninite melt and harzburgite residue. The points plotted\nhave 20\u201360% boninite added. For clarity, only the model\nresults for a 50% mixture is shown. The difference in bulk\ncomposition contributes minimally to the misfit of the\nexperimental data. The agreement with the experimental\nFigure 9. Estimated versus observed opx\/melt partition\ncoefficients for (a) SiO2, (b) CrO1.5, and (c) CaO. All phase\ncompositions have been converted to single cation oxides.\nPoints represent measured partition coefficients in experi-\nments, plotted against the estimated partition coefficients\nusing the experimental conditions and products in the\npredictive equations discussed in the text. For reference, a\nline with slope of 1 is shown in each plot. The three oxides\nwere selected to display the range of fits from excellent\n(SiO2), to good (CrO1.5), to poor (CaO). Not all studies\nreport Cr2O3 concentrations, so the number of DCrO1.5 data\npoints is less than for the major elements (e.g., SiO2, CaO).\nB02201 PARMAN AND GROVE: HARZBURGITE MELTING\n13 of 20\nB02201\ndata is excellent, with compositional differences less than\n10% relative for the majority of the data points. For the wet\nexperiments, the worst fit compositional parameter is CaO,\nwhich is significantly overestimated. This is not surprising\nas this element is one of the worst fit by the linear models,\nand should be most affected by aluminate speciation, which\nis not accounted for in the model. For the dry data, all of the\nestimates are quite good, likely because there are more\nanhydrous than hydrous experiments in the model data set,\nand the experimental difficulties are less, and so the\nanhydrous data are likely of higher quality.\n[42] Another indication of the accuracy of the model is\nhow well it predicts the point of cpx exhaustion. The model\nof Kinzler and Grove [Kinzler and Grove, 1992a, 1993]\n(from here on referred to as KG93), predicts melt compo-\nsitions in equilibrium with ol-opx-cpx-spinel. Predicted\nmelt compositions for melting a slightly depleted mantle\ncomposition at 1.5 GPa using KG93 are shown in Figure 11.\nCpx is exhausted from the residue at a melt fraction of 0.20\nat 1378\u0001C. Using the same mantle composition at 1.5 GPa,\nHARZ does not converge below a melt fraction of 0.15 and\na temperature of 1390\u0001C. The compositions of the melts at\nthe cpx exhaustion point predicted by both models are in\ngood agreement. Again, the worst agreement is for CaO,\nwhere the discrepancy is over 15% relative. None of the\ndata used for KG93 were used in the current model and the\nmodels are significantly different in their approach to\npredicting melt compositions. The good agreement of such\ndisparate approaches to predicting melt compositions is a\ngood indication of the accuracy of both models. For\ncomparison, pMELTS [Ghiorso et al., 2002] predicts cpx\nexhaustion at a significantly higher temperature (1440\u0001C),\nthough the melt fraction is similar (0.20). The melt compo-\nsition predicted by pMELTS is not consistent with either the\ncurrent model or KG93 with SiO2 = 44.85 wt % and MgO =\n17.75%.\n[43] Table 6 compares the accuracy of the current model\nwith existing predictive melting models (HARZ [this study],\nMELTS [Ghiorso and Sack, 1995], pMELTS [Ghiorso et\nal., 2002], BATCH [Longhi, 2002]). The predicted melt\ncompositions, phase fractions and temperatures are com-\npared to 2 anhydrous and 2 hydrous experiments [Falloon\nand Danyushevsky, 2000] that were not part of any of the\nmodels\u2019 databases. The predictive capability of each model\nis assessed in two ways. The first compares predicted and\nobserved melt compositions and phase fractions at the same\ntemperature as the experiment, allowing one to evaluate the\naccuracy of the phase fraction predictions. The second\ncomparison is made by varying temperature until the\npredicted melt fraction matches the observed melt fraction\nin the experiment. This allows evaluation of the temperature\naccuracy of the model. Both methods yield predicted melt\ncompositions. Since mass balance is a fundamental model\nconstraint, errors in melt fraction (F) map directly into melt\ncomposition. So comparisons at constant F give a better\nindication of the ability of the model to predict melt\ncompositions and yield better matches between the pre-\ndicted and observed melt composition than the constant\ntemperature comparisons. Pressure has not been varied in\nthese comparisons. Because of the covariance of P and T,\nlowering P at constant T has an effect similar to raising T at\nconstant P (i.e., melt fraction increases).\n[44] Overall, HARZ yields the best fit for both wet and\ndry experiments (Table 6). At constant F, the predictions\nof HARZ and BATCH for the two anhydrous experiments\n(T-3569 and T-3520) are remarkably similar and yield\nthe most accurate melt compositions. Errors on the major\noxides (SiO2, Al2O3, FeO, MgO and CaO) are all less than\n5% relative, and mostly 2% or less. Both HARZ and\nBATCH predict temperatures that are too high by 30\u2013\n65\u0001C. The pMELTS model does a better job of predicting\ntemperature with errors of 15\u201330\u0001C, but the predicted melt\ncompositions have significantly higher errors (up to 14%\nrelative for major oxides SiO2, Al2O3, FeO, MgO, and\nCaO, with most errors \u00015%).\n[45] For the hydrous experiments (T-3486 and T-3490),\nthe results are mixed. At 1.5 GPa, the pMELTS program is\nthe most accurate, with errors on the major oxides less than\n5% relative and a temperature error of only 10\u0001C. However,\nat 2.0 GPa, the compositional errors of pMELTS greatly\nincrease (up to 17%), though the temperature accuracy is\nstill excellent (7\u0001C). The pMELTS program is a version of\nthe MELTS program optimized to predict mantle melt\ncompositions near 1 GPa, so its loss of accuracy at higher\npressures is not unexpected. At 1.5 GPa, the compositional\nerrors of HARZ are below 10% relative and the temperature\nFigure 10. Predicted phase fractions during melting for\nfertile mantle (anhydrous) compared to published experi-\nmental results [Walter, 1998]. Pressure is 3.0 GPa. Below\n1480\u0001C, the model is does not converge on a real solution,\nindicating that cpx is a stable phase. The cpx-out point (20%\nmelt) is consistent with previous experiments (19\u201320%\n[Baker and Stolper, 1994]) and MELTs calculations\n(18% [Hirschmann et al., 1999]) at 1.0 GPa. The experiments\nof Walter were part of the data used to calibrate the model,\nso this plot shows how well the model recovers the input\ndata. Melt fractions are recovered to within \u00b10.05 and solid\nfractions to within \u00b10.1. The melt reaction is also recovered,\nwith opx decreasing rapidly with little change in ol fraction.\nThe opx exhaustion point is reproduced within 20\u0001C. The\nconcave up shape of the melt curve and its slope (0.16%\nmelting\/\u0001C is isobaric melt productivity) are consistent\nwith thermodynamic calculations [Asimow et al., 1997;\nHirschmann et al., 1999]. Note that no phase fraction data\nwere used to calibrate the model, only partitioning data.\nB02201 PARMAN AND GROVE: HARZBURGITE MELTING\n14 of 20\nB02201\nFigure 11. Predicted melt compositions at 1.5 GPa compared to published experiments [Falloon and\nDanyushevsky, 2000] and melting models [Kinzler and Grove, 1992a, 1993]. The Falloon and\nDanyushevsky experiments used various mixtures of a boninite and harzburgite as their starting materials.\nThe solid lines show the predicted melt compositions for 50\/50 boninite\/harzburgite mixtures with 0%\n(gray line) and 3% H2O (black line). The hydrous experiments (black circles) had 35, 45, and 61% (from\nleft to right in the diagram) added boninite, while the dry experiments had 62 and 59 (gray diamonds) and\n19, 20, and 17% (open diamonds). The open diamonds fall of the predicted curve for the incompatible\nelements because of the lower amount of added boninite. These experiments were not used to calibrate\nthe model, and so represent a good test of the model\u2019s accuracy. The left sides of the curves represent the\npoint where cpx is exhausted from the residue. The right sides of the curves are where opx is exhausted\nfrom the residue. In the FeO plot, the temperatures of the hydrous experiments are shown. The predicted\ntemperatures for the predicted hydrous melting curve are marked in 50\u0001C increments and correspond well\nto the experimental data. Predicted melts of a slightly depleted (model MORB source), anhydrous\ncomposition are also shown. The model of Kinzler and Grove [1992a, 1993] is used to model melting up\nto the cpx-out point (thick dashed line). The model presented in the current text is used to predict melting\nafter cpx-out.

Of all of the Falloon and Danyushevsky\n[2000] experiments, these are the least well reproduced by\nHARZ. The accuracy at 2.0 GPa is excellent, with compo-\nsitional errors less than 5% (except for CaO, which has a\n10% error) and a temperature error of only 5\u0001C. It is\npeculiar that the HARZ model reproduces the Falloon\nand Danyushevsky [2000] experiments over a range of\npressure and H2O contents, except at 1.5 GPa under\nhydrous conditions. The Falloon and Danyushevsky experi-\nments were not included in the HARZ model because they\ncaused a significant degradation of the linear regressions. It\nmay be that it is the 1.5 GPa hydrous experiments in\nparticular that are not consistent with the other experimental\ndata sets. The BATCH model only predicts anhydrous phase\nequilibria and so no comparison is possible for hydrous\nexperiments.\n[46] The HARZ model generally overpredicts temper-\natures by up to 60\u0001C, with average errors of 35\u0001C. Typical\nmajor oxide errors are 5% relative. TiO2 concentrations are\nwell reproduced. Cr2O3 concentrations are consistently\nunderpredicted (up to 45% relative error). Na2O is consis-\ntently overpredicted, though this may be due to errors in the\nanalysis of the experimental glass, where Na has a tendency\nto migrate during analysis. The absolute errors on K2O and\nMnO are small since they are in such low abundances. Their\npartitioning behavior is fairly simple (K2O is incompatible\nand MnO has D = 1), so most of the error is likely to be\nanalytical, either in the experiments that went into the\nHARZ database or in the Falloon and Danyushevsky\n[2000] experiments. It should also be noted that the Falloon\nand Danyushevsky experiments were not included in the\nmodel data set because they caused a significant decrease in\nthe fits to the partition coefficients, indicating that their\nresults are not consistent with the other experimental studies\nincluded in the linear regressions.\n[47] In sum, the current model is a significant improve-\nment over existing models for predicting melt compositions\nof ol-opx saturated melts. For anhydrous experiments, the\nBATCH model is equally accurate, but it does not predict\nhydrous phase equilibria. The pMELTS program generally\nhas better temperature accuracy, especially at pressures\nbelow 1.5 GPa, but has significantly larger compositional\nerrors under most conditions. The results of the MELTS\nprogram are also shown in Table 6. In all cases, they are the\nleast accurate of the four models.\n7.2. Effects of H2O, Bulk Composition, and Pressure\n[48] In the current model, only SiO2 and Al2O3 partition-\ning are direct functions of melt H2O contents. Mass balance\nand stoichiometric constraints cause the variations in melt\nH2O, SiO2 and Al2O3 contents to affect the concentration of\nthe other elements. The dramatic rise in SiO2 contents is the\nmost noticable compositional effect of H2O (Figure 12).\nWith 4 wt % H2O added to the bulk composition (14 wt %\nH2O in the melt), the SiO2 content of the first melt after the\ncpx-out point (left end of lines, Figure 12a) rises from 47.7\nto 53.8 wt %. H2O along the 4 wt % bulk H2O line varies\nfrom 14 wt % down to 10 wt % as the melt extent increases\n(left to right). Because the melting reaction is dominated by\nopx, the melting curves converge toward its composition as\nmelting extent increases. Part of the convergence of the\nhydrous and anhydrous curves is also the drop in melt H2O\ncontents along the curves. The last melt in the ol-opx\nstability field (right end of the lines) rises only from 51.6\nto 53 wt % SiO2 when 4 wt % H2O is added (10 wt % H2O\nin melt).\n[49] It is well known that H2O lowers the melting temper-\natures of silicates. In the current model, there is no explicit\nrelationship between H2O and temperature. Rather, the\naddition of H2O lowers the concentrations of all other\nelements in the melt by dilution, while the composition of\nthe solids is not directly affected (H2O is assumed to be\ntotally incompatible). This increases the apparent D values\nfor all elements. Since all of the D values (except NaO0.5)\nare inversely related to temperature, the higher D values are\ntranslated into lower equilibration temperatures. In practice,\nthe temperature is prescribed, so the model responds to\nadded H2O by increasing melting extents.\n[50] For most elements, the effect of H2O to decrease\nequilibration temperatures and thereby increase partition\ncoefficients, causes element concentrations in the melt to\ndecrease with added H2O. The effect is greatest for MgO,\nwhich can be seen in the shift of the curves in Figure 12 to\nlower melt MgO contents. Concentrations of the remaining\nelements decrease to a lesser extent, and large amounts of\nH2O (>3 wt %) are required to produce a noticable change\nin their concentrations.\n7.3. Effect of Source Depletion\n[51] The effect of melting a depleted source is also shown\nin Figure 12. The bulk composition used is a 50\/50 mix of a\nfertile mantle composition (MM3 [Walter, 1998]) and a\nharzburgite (2PKI-38 [Falloon and Danyushevsky, 2000])\nand represents a moderately depleted mantle source. Be-\ncause the melting reaction is so dominated by opx, one can\nthink of the melting curves as mixing curves between the\nlow SiO2, low MgO melt at the cpx-out point and the\ncomposition of the opx entering the melt (plus or minus a\nsmall amount of olivine). The more depleted the source, the\nless of the low SiO2, low MgO melt is present, allowing\nthe melting curves to shift toward the composition of opx.\nThe increase in compatible element concentrations lowers\ntheir partition coefficients, which is reflected in higher\nequilibration temperatures (Figure 12).\n7.4. Effect of Pressure\n[52] As with the effect of H2O, only SiO2 and Al2O3\npartitioning are directly affected by pressure in our\nmodel. Pressure dramatically lowers SiO2 contents, and\nthereby increases the concentrations of all other elements\nin the melt (Figure 13). The result is that the effect of\npressure is almost exactly opposite the effect of H2O.\nNotes to Table 6.\naExperiment of Falloon and Danyushevsky [2000].\nbBulk composition of the experiment and used in the predictive models.\ncWeight percent.\ndWeight fraction of phase.\nB02201 PARMAN AND GROVE: HARZBURGITE MELTING\n17 of 20\nB02201\nThis is consistent with previous observations of the\ncompeting effects of H2O and pressure on phase bound-\naries [Gaetani and Grove, 1998].\n[53] The effect of H2O on melt composition is also\npressure dependent. At low pressures (1\u20132 GPa), the\nanhydrous and 1.5 wt % H2O melting curves overlap\nfor all elements except SiO2 and MgO. At 6.0 GPa, the\nAl2O3 concentrations of the hydrous melts near the cpx-\nout boundary (left side of curves) are distinctly higher in\nthe hydrous melts while FeO contents are lower. At\nhigher degrees of melting, the dry and wet melt compo-\nsitions converge as they approach the composition of opx,\nand the effect of pressure is less pronounced. The effect\nof H2O on SiO2 contents, on the other hand, varies little\nwith pressure (Figure 13).\n7.5. Empirical Versus Thermodynamic Modeling\n[54] Fully thermodynamic models such as MELTS have\nthe ambitious goal of relating phase compositions to ther-\nmodynamic state functions over a wide range of composi-\ntions and stable phases [Ghiorso, 1991; Ghiorso and Sack,\n1995]. The current semiempirical model has the more\nmodest goal of predicting melt compositions in equilibrium\nwith ol and opx. By limiting the scope of the model,\nsubstantial accuracy has been achieved with a relatively\nsimple model, though at the sacrifice of insight into the\nunderlying thermodynamic controls. The limited scope of\nthe current model allows it to be modified readily, and in\nparticular, the database of experiments on which it is based\ncan be changed. This is a useful feature, as new experi-\nmental melting data (especially hydrous experiments) are\nsteadily being produced.\n8. Conclusions\n[55] A partitioning-based numerical model has been con-\nstructed that predicts the composition of melts in equilibri-\num with ol and opx under both hydrous and anhydrous\nconditions. The composition of the solid phases and the\nmass proportions of all phases are also predicted. The model\ninputs are pressure, temperature and the bulk composition of\nthe system. The model is more accurate than any extant\nmodel, with typical compositional errors of 1\u20135% relative\nfor the major oxides. Typical errors on temperature are 30\u2013\n40\u0001C.\n[56] The experimental data indicate that at mantle temper-\natures, H2O predominantly dissolves into silicate melts as\ndissociated OH\u0002. For a given bulk composition, the effect\nof H2O on SiO2 activity coefficients is primarily thermal,\nand suggest a two-lattice model for the mixing of melt\nspecies [Drake, 1976]. The experimental data also indicate\nthat hydrous magmas are not intrinsically higher in SiO2\nthan anhydrous melts. We propose that the high SiO2\ncharacter of subduction-related magmas is predominantly\na temperature effect and that mafic, high-SiO2 (>54 wt %)\nFigure 12.

Melt H2O contents at the beginning and\nending of melting are labeled in the Al2O3 plot. For clarity,\nthe 2.5% H2O curve is not shown in Figures 12b and 12c.\nH2O increases SiO2 and lowers Al2O3 and FeO, at a given\nMgO content. The cpx and opx exhaustion points (left and\nright sides of curves) shift to lower MgO values. The effect\nof water decreases as melting progresses partly due to the\ndecreasing melt H2O content and partly due to the fact that\nol becomes the only remaining solid. Melting a more\ndepleted source shortens the melting curves and shifts them\nto higher MgO and FeO concentrations and lower Al2O3\nconcentrations.\nB02201 PARMAN AND GROVE: HARZBURGITE MELTING\n18 of 20\nB02201\nandesites require H2O contents >7 wt % to lower melting\ntemperatures to the appropriate levels.\n[57] Acknowledgments.
