However, questions remain over the \nrelative advantages of different approaches; for example buffering patches versus increasing \nconnectivity. Potential effects of woodland fragmentation include reduction in regional woodland cover, \nreduced patch size, edge effects with loss of core habitat, and increased isolation with disruption of \ndispersal and metapopulation dynamics. We adopt an evidence-based approach to review how each of \nthese affects woodland birds with an emphasis on studies from the UK and use this to identify \nmanagement priorities for mitigation. There is evidence for both patch area and composition effects: \nlarger woodlands support more woodland bird species and woods located within sparsely wooded \nlandscapes are less valuable to specialist woodland species. Bird assemblages show a nested pattern \nwith respect to area, thus species found in small woods also occur in large woods but not vice versa. \nHowever, small woods may be preferred by a few edge species, while small woods also have greater \nvariability in bird species composition. Consideration of the metapopulation dynamics of specialist \nspecies with poor dispersal shows that creating or buffering large woodlands is more efficient than a \ngreater total area of small fragments. Connectivity appears most useful for widespread generalist \nspecies with almost continuous populations. Woodland structure and quality are of overwhelming \nimportance: as well as mature woodland, young growth, scrub and edges are also key components. \nThere is an urgent need to examine the relationship between nest predation and landscape structure \nwithin UK woodlands. \n \nKeywords: habitat fragmentation, wooded networks, landscape restoration, dispersal, metapopulation. \n  2 \n \n \nMany different factors potentially contribute to recent changes in the abundance and distribution of \nwoodland birds (Amar & Hewson this issue). Within woodlands, habitat quality and structure are of \nmajor importance, but in this paper we examine the extent to which landscape structure is also \nimportant when planning strategies for the conservation of woodland birds. \nBritain has a low proportion of woodland cover and that which remains is highly fragmented. \nElsewhere, such fragmentation is considered to be a serious threat to biodiversity value (Tilman et al. \n1994, Saccheri et al. 1998, Hanski & Ovaskainen 2000). In the UK, extensive woodland loss and \nfragmentation had taken place a millennia ago (Rackham 1986) so that contemporary conservation may \nbe starting from a position where loss of species with large-area requirements and evolutionary \nadaptation of remaining species has already occurred. Functional isolation has increased with \nintensification and simplification of the agricultural matrix since the mid part of the 20th Century. More \nencouragingly, the extent of woodland cover is now increasing (Mason, this issue), while agri-\nenvironment measures can be used to improve connectivity and reduce functional isolation. There are \ninitiatives to recreate woodland networks, to combat ecological isolation in a targeted fashion without \nthe need for large-scale expansion of woodland ( Peterken et al. 1995, Hampson & Peterken 1998, \nPeterken 2000 & 2003). Spatial prioritisation of woodland creation and habitat mitigation are \nincreasingly based on consideration of landscape structure and land cover thresholds (Peterken 2002, \nWoodland Trust 2002). Taking this approach further, the new ancient woodland policy for England \n(Forestry Commission 2005) aims to create opportunities to develop networks of woodland and other \nsemi-natural habitats into ecologically functional landscapes. \nThis raises important questions as to how best to prioritise the addition of new woodland within \nthe landscape. What are the best configurations for key species and which existing landscapes should \nbe targeted? Metapopulation dynamics are often assumed to be important, leading to a set of \nprescriptions that emphasise connectivity (Harrison 1994), which have consequently been adopted as \nplanning guidance for woodlands (Defra 2006). However, the relevance of metapopulation principles to \nthe colonisation and persistence of woodland species has been challenged (Dolman & Fuller 2003). \nRenewed attention to the detrimental edge effects and the importance of core areas places emphasis \non buffering existing woodlands (Dolman & Fuller 2003). In evaluating priorities it is vital that strategic \npolicy and conservation prescriptions are based on available evidence, rather than assumptions and \ncultural trends (Sutherland et al. 2004). This is especially true for woodland creation in which decisions \ntaken now constrain opportunities in the future, while created woodland can take decades or even \ncenturies for its habitat quality to develop. \nMapping, modelling and decision support tools are now available to analyse meta-population \nand connectivity networks (Reijnen et al. 1995). For example, least-cost analysis tools (Adriaensen et \nal. 2003, Chardon et al. 2003) within BEETLE (Biological and Environmental Evaluation Tools for \nLandscape Ecology) have been used by Forest Research to analyse potential woodland networks in \n  3 \nWales and Scotland to aid the targeting of woodland conservation action (Watts et al. 2005a, Watts et \nal. 2005b). Using remotely sensed and field habitat data, such as Centre for Ecology and Hydrology \n(CEH) Land Cover 2000 data (Haines-Young et al. 2000), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) Phase \n1 survey (Day 1989, Howe & Blackstock 1991) and Ancient Woodland Inventory (CCW, unpublished \ndata), it is possible to define and map patches of woodland and also to analyse the composition of the \nmatrix (Fig. 1a, b). By making assumptions about the ecological cost of dispersal of generic species in \ndifferent matrix habitats a cost surface for dispersal can be produced (Fig. 1c). Combining these in a \ngiven landscape allows potential connectivity networks to be defined (Fig. 1d). Clearly, in any given \nlandscape, the outcome of such modelling depends on assumptions about dispersal ability and costs. \nWoodland networks defined for species with specialist requirements and limited dispersal ability are \ngreatly restricted with less connectivity, than the broader networks defined for more generalist species \nwith good dispersal ability (Watts et al. 2005a). \nIn the UK, such woodland network analyses have largely been conducted using generic \nspecies, with dispersal characteristics defined primarily in relation to woodland invertebrates or plants. \nBut what are the dispersal abilities of woodland birds; is there evidence that woodland created within a \nnetwork is more likely to be colonised, or can some species readily disperse between networks? \nCrucially, if new woodland is to be created within such networks, where and how should it be located \u2013 \nfor example joining and buffering existing fragments, or placed as a stepping stone between fragments? \nIn the remainder of this paper we consider how landscape structure affects community and \npopulation processes of species richness, colonisation, local abundance, productivity, persistence and \nprobability of local extinction. We review empirical evidence for the importance of mechanisms and \ndraw conclusions for the restoration of wooded landscapes. \n \nEFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AND CONFIGURATION \n \nOnce extensive woodland cover has been reduced to numerous fragments. This fragmentation affects \nboth landscape composition (the relative amount of different habitats) but also the configuration, or \nspatial arrangement, of the woodland remaining (Wiens 1994). Composition is important to woodland \nbirds both in terms of the extent of woodland within a landscape and also the composition and \npermeability of the matrix, with consequences for ecological isolation. The configuration of woodland \npatches has consequences for patch size, the ratio of edge to interior, the proximity or isolation of \npatches from sources of colonists and the juxtaposition or contagion of landscape elements (Dolman & \nFuller 2003, Dunning et al. 1992). Both the composition of landuse and habitats within the matrix and \ntheir configuration relative to woodland fragments can affect the intensity of edge effects. \nWoodlands can be considered as homogenous patches in a heterogeneous landscape, but this \nis a simplification as individual woods are also \u2018patchy\u2019 containing areas of open habitat and stands that \ndiffer in age, structure or species composition. Studies of landscape ecology often focus on the larger of \nthese scales but neglect the second. Clearly the size and arrangement of individual woodland patches \n  4 \nwithin the landscape can be important for population processes of dispersal, colonisation and local \nextinction. However, the spatial arrangement of habitat elements within woodlands can affect individual \nforaging and provisioning behaviour and the suitability of woodland habitats. Therefore we give some \nattention to effects of landscape heterogeneity within woodlands, as well as the arrangement of \nwoodlands within the wider landscape. \n \nEffects of Landscape Composition \n \nMetapopulation theory predicts that regional population abundance may affect local abundance (Hanski \n1999) and such relationships between regional and local abundance have been found in studies of birds \n(Andr\u00e9n 1994, Villard et al. 1999). When loss of suitable woodland patches exceeds a threshold, lack of \nsufficient immigrants to remaining patches is predicted to cause metapopulation collapse and regional \nextinction (Hanski 1998). Evidence for this is provided by a Spatially Explicit Population Model (SEPM) \nof a Wood Nuthatch Sitta europaea metapopulation within a sparsely wooded landscape (20km x 20km; \nc. 4% woodland cover) in Cambridgeshire (Alderman et al. 2005). Population size in wood fragments \nincreases with increasing numbers of immigrants from an adjacent more heavily wooded source \nlandscape, but below a threshold of c.10 immigrants per year the simulated population collapses \n(Alderman et al. 2005). The model predicts that observed numbers within the study area could only be \nmaintained with an immigration rate of 10-15 individuals per year. However, within-patch habitat quality \nis also important, improving this lowered the immigration threshold above which the simulated Wood \nNuthatch population became self-sustaining (Alderman et al. 2005). Earlier empirical models of Wood \nNuthatch that considered habitat quality and local landscape structure (area of suitable habitat within a \n3 km radius of the focal wood) but that did not incorporate individual dispersal, predicted higher \nnumbers than were observed in this landscape, leading Bellamy et al. (1998) to conclude that isolation \nwas a problem for this population. \nIn a study of fragmented woodland (n = 16) in a sparsely wooded region of North Humberside, \nEngland (mean 2.6% woodland cover) species richness of woodland birds was most strongly related to \nthe distance of the wood to the boundary of a \u2018wooded archipelago\u2019 (defined as > 4% woodland cover), \nand less strongly to characteristics of the woodlands themselves (McCollin 1993). This is consistent \nwith reduced colonisation of woodland patches located in that part of the landscape with a lower \nproportion of woodland cover (< 2%). \nFor Western Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, that requires large areas of old boreal forest for \nindividual territories (e.g. 20-50 ha) and much larger areas for a lek (e.g. 200-500 ha: Anglestam 1992) \nthe effects of reducing the proportion of old forest within the landscape are complex and vary depending \non the scale of landscape grain (Rolstad & Wegge 1987). Analysis of two contrasting landscapes in \nNorway suggests that, when loss of old forest is low or moderate, then the density of leks may be higher \nif the landscape is relatively fine-grained, comprising small clear-cuts among a matrix of old forest and a \nhigh density of internal edges. In contrast, when old forest cover is reduced to less than fifty percent of \n  5 \nthe landscape, then density of males is higher if the mosaic is course-grained, so that individual patches \nare large enough to support a lek (Rolstad & Wegge 1987). However, the viability of woodland grouse \npopulations may be further compromised in fragmented landscapes, due to proximity of remaining old \nforest patches to open habitats that are a source of intruding generalist predators (Anglestam 1992). \nThis is supported by evidence from Finland, where for both Western Capercaillie and Black Grouse T. \ntetrix, the proportion of post-breeding females accompanied by broods was lower in heavily fragmented \nthan in more continuous forest landscapes (Kurki et al. 2000). Here landscape effects were strongest at \na scale of approximately100 km2, much larger than the size of family home ranges, and were \ninterpreted as being due to higher nest predation by generalist predators in fragmented landscapes \nrather than local effects such as distance to edge.  \nAlthough species occurrence, composition and richness is primarily determined by \ncharacteristics of the woodland itself, at both local and regional scales the species richness of migrant \nwoodland birds may also be affected by the amount of woodland within the landscape ( Hinsley et al. \n1998, Bennett et al. 2004). Within a sparsely wooded region of Eastern England, the species richness \nof migrant woodland birds is greater in woods (n = 88, size range: 0.5-29.9 ha) with a greater area of \nwoodland and length of hedge within 1 km, as well as depending on characteristics of the woods \nthemselves (area, perimeter) (Bennett et al. 2004). At a wider scale, the total number of migrant species \nrecorded in replicate small woods within each of six study areas (three in the UK, one each in the \nNetherlands, Denmark, and Norway), increased with increasing percentage woodland cover in the study \nareas (Hinsley et al. 1998). \nThe extent of woodland within the landscape is clearly important and landscapes with a greater \nproportion of woodland cover are of greater value. But to what extent does the arrangement of that \nwoodland matter? \n \nEffects of woodland size \n \nWoodland area is generally the most important predictor of species occupancy, richness, composition \nand turnover (Bennett et al. 2004). In eastern England, larger woods contain more species (Bellamy et \nal. 1996a) (Fig. 2a). However, the increase in species number is largely due to a rapid increase in very \nsmall woods (e.g. from 0.1 to 3 ha), followed by a progressive, but slower, increase up to 10 ha. \nAbsolute turnover (the number of extinctions or gains of species within individual woods \nbetween consecutive years) is similar across the range of woodland size (Hinsley et al. 1995)(Fig. 2b), \nthough in smaller woods this represents a larger proportion of the species present. In 145 small woods \ncensused over three years, the probability of extinction was universally lower in larger woods or woods \nwith more breeding pairs, for all eight common species analysed: Winter Wren Troglodytes troglodytes, \nEuropean Robin Erithacus rubecula, Hedge Accentor Prunella modularis, Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus, \nGreat Tit Parus major, Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, Common Blackbird Turdus merula and Song Thrush \nTurdus philomelos (Bellamy et al. 1996b). For Long-tailed Tit Aegithalos caudatus, some stochastic \n  6 \nextinction occurred even in woods up to 10 ha. However, few or no area effects were found for species \ncolonisation. As a consequence of species turnover, the species composition of smaller woods is less \npredictable, with greater heterogeneity among woods. \nThe species contributing to turnover are those with small population sizes and thus differ \nbetween large and small woods (Table 1). In small woods colonisation \/ extinction is by common and \nubiquitous species, while in larger woods, where population sizes of these common species are larger, \nother more woodland-dependent species, occurring in lower numbers and usually absent from smaller \nwoods, contribute to turnover. Therefore, species occurrence shows a nested pattern. Woodland birds \ndiffer in their area thresholds for breeding (Fig. 3). In general, species with less specific habitat \nrequirements such as Common Blackbird and European Robin (also Chaffinch, Blue Tit and Winter \nWren) occur in most woods including those of 1 ha and less. Other species, such as Eurasian \nTreecreeper Certhia familiaris and Marsh Tit Poecile palustris (also Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus \ncollybita, Long-tailed Tit and Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major) only approach 100% \noccurrence in woods of 10 ha or more. These are species usually considered to be dependent on \nwoodland and are less common or absent from secondary habitats (such as hedgerows and gardens). \nThe intensive studies in Cambridgeshire took place in a sparsely wooded landscape (< 2% \ncover) with many extremely small woodland fragments and few large woodlands. In landscapes that \nretain a greater proportion of woodland cover and larger maximum woodland area, species with more \nexacting area requirements may persist, so that further accumulation of woodland species may be \nexpected beyond the 10 ha threshold of the Cambridgeshire study. In the study of 16 woodlands in \nNorth Humberside overall species richness increased with woodland area (McCollin 1993). However, \nfor a group of ubiquitous species (including Great Tit, Blue Tit, European Robin, Winter Wren, Common \nBlackbird, Hedge Accentor, Chaffinch, but also Song Thrush, Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, Spotted \nFlycatcher Muscicapa striata and Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus) richness reached an \nasymptote at less than 10 ha, while for a group of \u2018woodland\u2019 species (including Common Redstart \nPhoenicurus phoenicurus, Hawfinch Coccothraustes coccothraustes, Great Spotted Woodpecker, Tree \nPipit Anthus trivialus, Eurasian Treecreeper, Long-tailed Tit, Coal Tit Periparus ater and Marsh Tit) \nspecies accumulation continued beyond 10 ha (McCollin 1993). \nIn a study of 165 pine dominated forests in Poland ranging in area from 0.01 ha - 282 ha \n(including 15 forests of 10-30 ha and 14 > 30 ha), species richness again increased with increasing \narea, as well as being influenced by structural (number of age classes represented) and biological \n(number of tree species) diversity (Cieslak 1985). A number of generalist and edge species approached \nmaximal levels of occupancy in woods < 3 ha (e.g. Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, Chaffinch, \nCommon Chiffchaff), or < 10 ha (Willow Warbler, Tree Pipit, Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, \nIcterine Warbler Hippolais icterina, European Robin), while others only approached maximum frequency \nin woods > 10ha (e.g. Common Blackbird, Willow Tit Poecile montanus, Crested Tit Lophophanes \ncristatus, Winter Wren, Spotted Flycatcher, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, Blackcap) or > 30 ha \n(e.g. Wood Lark Lullula arborea, Hawfinch, Goldcrest Regulus regulus, Short-toed Treecreeper Certhia \n  7 \nbrachydactyla) (Cieslak, 1985). A number of species were absent from woods of 10 ha or less (e.g. \nNorthern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis, Red-breasted Flycatcher Ficedula parva, Mistle Thrush Turdus \nviscivorus). In this study region species accumulation clearly continues beyond the range of areas \nconsidered in the Cambridgeshire and Humberside studies. However, it is also important to note the \nvery different landscape associations of some species, such as Common Blackbird, European Robin \nand Winter Wren, that responded positively to increasing forest area in Poland but are ubiquitous or \nedge species in England. The high incidence of \u2018edge-adapted\u2019 species within the British avifauna is \nfurther emphasised by comparison with the Netherlands: although Common Blackbird, Winter Wren and \nGreat Tit had high probability of occurrence in small woods, as they did in England, Hedge Accentor \nonly reached maximal incidence in woods larger than 5 ha (van Dorp & Opdam 1987). \nThe nested pattern of species occurrence and turnover with a greater number of woodland \nspecialists breeding in larger woods, suggests a strategy of targeted woodland creation in large \nwoodland blocks, or additional buffering of larger in preference to smaller woodlands. However, as \nhabitat quality and species density may vary with woodland size, it is important to identify any species \nfor which small woods are more suitable. Counter-intuitively, a number of woodland species occur at \nhigher densities in smaller woods. Bellamy et al. (2000) analysed species abundance data from annual \ncensuses of 53-160 woods (up to 10 ha) over eight years, by fitting a power function of the form: \n \nAbundance = a. (Area) b \n \nWhere a is a scaling parameter and b describes the relationship between abundance and area. When b \nis equal to one then abundance is proportional to area (i.e. density is constant). For Long-tailed Tit, \nalthough a mean slope of 1.3 (Table 2) is suggestive of higher proportionate abundance in larger \nwoods, b did not differ significantly from 1.0 in six of the eight years (Bellamy et al. 2000). Conversely, if \nthe slope of the power function is less than one then density is higher in smaller woods. Of eight \nspecies tested, seven tended to have higher densities in smaller woods (Bellamy et al. 2000) (Table 2). \nFor both Hedge Accentor and Common Blackbird, the estimate of the slope was significantly \nless than one in every one of the eight years (Bellamy et al. 2000). Furthermore, both Hedge Accentor \nand Common Blackbird had lower numbers in large woods in those years with a lower regional \npopulation, suggesting small woods are preferentially settled and that large woods may be suboptimal \nfor these species. Preference of Hedge Accentor and Common Blackbird for smaller woods and \nwoodland edges has been related to their use of adjacent open habitat for foraging (Bellamy et al. 2000, \nHinsley et al. 1995). For Chaffinch, the slope was also less than 1.0 in all eight years. For Blue Tit, \nWinter Wren, Great Tit and European Robin, results were also indicative of higher density in smaller \nwoods. However, in contrast to Common Blackbird and Hedge Accentor, for Chaffinch, Blue Tit, Great \nTit, and European Robin numbers were lower in small woods in years with a lower regional population \nlevels. This suggests that, even though higher densities were found in smaller woods, these woods may \nbe sub-optimal and a buffer effect may be operating. Evidence for this is available for Blue and Great \n  8 \nTit, which have a lower reproductive output in smaller woods in Cambridgeshire (Table 3) (Hinsley et al. \n1999). Furthermore, in Oxfordshire there is evidence of phenotypic quality-dependent dispersal of Great \nTits from farmland into better quality woodland breeding habitat (Riddington & Gosler 1995), identified \nby preferential settlement in the woodland by individuals with greater body mass as nestlings (Verhulst \net al. 1997). \nIn conclusion, large woods are again found to be preferable for most species. However, for \nsome edge and supplementing species such as Common Blackbird and Hedge Accentor, small woods \nare preferable. Within a region, heterogeneity of wood size may therefore be useful.  \nSo far we have considered the effects of woodland area in terms of individual woodlands. \nHowever, it is also important to consider the size of individual woods within woodland networks. The \nSEPM of (Alderman et al. 2005) considers the Wood Nuthatch, a poorly dispersing woodland habitat-\nspecialist. The model was used to evaluate different scenarios of strategic woodland habitat creation. \nThe current landscape in the Cambridgeshire study area, comprising small patches totalling 298 ha of \nsuitable habitat, cannot sustain a viable population in the absence of immigration. Targeting woodland \ncreation to buffer large core areas sustains the population and even adding just 40-60 ha of new \nwoodland adjoining the one largest wood makes the population viable (Table 4). However, adding a \nmuch greater area of habitat dispersed across all small woods failed to make the meta-population self-\nsustaining. This demonstrates, for this species at least, the strategic importance of large \u2018mainland\u2019 or \nsource patches, with larger local population size, lower chance of stochastic extinction and that \ntherefore favour metapopulation viability (Hanski et al. 1996). This finding is emphasised in the \u2018key \npatch\u2019 approach to network analysis adopted by Verboom et al. (2001). For two generic bird species \nwith contrasting area requirements and dispersal abilities modelled within a habitat network, the total \narea of habitat required to sustain a viable population was again much less if the network included a \n\u201ckey patch\u201d, defined as a single patch large enough to sustain a population with only minimal \nimmigration (Verboom et al. 2001). Reviewing avian time-series data from a range of studies Verboom \net al. (2001) found that a minimum population of 12-25 pairs within a single patch were required for local \npopulation persistence. \n \nDispersal in complex landscapes \u2013 proximity, isolation and connectivity \n \nThe crucial importance of one or more core woodlands to the viability of the Wood Nuthatch \nmetapopulation is a result of the limited dispersal ability of this species, which is thought to have a high \nmortality during dispersal. A contrasting species with good dispersal ability and negligible mortality risk \nfrom natal dispersal should be able to sustain a metapopulation across a fragmented network \ncomprising only small patches. It is, therefore, important to understand how representative the Wood \nNuthatch is relative to the dispersal abilities of other woodland birds. \n \n  9 \nDispersal distances of birds breeding in the UK are typically a few km (Paradis et al. 1998). The \nWood Nuthatch, although amongst the poorer dispersing woodland species (Fig. 4) is not atypical. \nMigrants generally disperse further than residents (Paradis et al. 1998) and among the 28 species of \nwoodland birds considered in Fig. 4, the three species with the greatest mean dispersal distances are \nBlackcap, Common Chiffchaff and Pied Flycatcher. Larger birds also disperse further (Paradis et al. \n1998) and the next greatest distances are shown by Great Spotted Woodpecker and Eurasian \nSparrowhawk Accipiter nisus. Contrary to theoretical expectations (Laurance 1991), more abundant \nspecies disperse shorter distances (Paradis et al. 1998). Although the Wood Nuthatch appears to be a \nclassically dispersal limited species, the two species with lowest dispersal amongst the 28 considered \nhere are Hedge Accentor and Chaffinch. \nDispersal has important consequences for the spatial structuring of populations, and a positive \ncorrelation between dispersal ability and population synchrony has been widely predicted in the \ntheoretical literature. This was confirmed by an analysis of 53 British bird species; the strength of local \npopulation synchrony (mean of cross-correlations between pairs of census sites, after controlling for \ninter-year trends) was greater in species with greater mean dispersal distance (Paradis et al. 1999). In \naddition, population heterogeneity (variance in local abundance) was greater in species with lower \nmean natal dispersal (Paradis et al. 1998). \nAt the more local scale of the Cambridgeshire study region, population synchrony of woodland \nbirds is related to distance between woods and also to characteristics of the wider landscape (Bellamy \net al. 2003). Of 13 species tested eight showed a decline in (global) population synchrony with \nincreasing distance between woods (Bellamy et al. 2003). However, only two remain significant (Hedge \nAccentor, Long-tailed Tit) after Bonferoni correction to control the type-1 error rate across the multiple \nMantel tests. For three species (Winter Wren, Long-tailed Tit, Hedge Accentor) there was evidence that \nthe decline in synchrony between pairs of woodlands at greater distances might have been due to \nlimited dispersal: a relationship between synchrony and distance was found within the scale of natal \ndispersal, but not at greater distances. That only three of the 11 species had evidence for dispersal \ncausing a decline in synchrony with distance, suggested that dispersal is not a general driver of \nsynchrony at this scale. For two of these (Winter Wren, Hedge Accentor) and also for Blackcap, local \nsynchrony was negatively related to distance between woods within wooded landscapes but not in open \nlandscapes, suggesting a role of landscape structure in dispersal and synchrony (Bellamy et al. 2003). \nFor Common Blackbird and Hedge Accentor, within a scale of 20 km, local synchrony was related to \ndistance between woods and also to the difference in the amount of hedge around the wood. Woods \nwith little connectivity had similar synchrony, woods with more connectivity were also similar in the \ntiming of population change, but woods with good connectivity fluctuated out of step with unconnected \nwoods. These are extinction prone species and the results can be interpreted as a lag in recolonisation \nafter local extinction in more isolated woods (Bellamy et al. 2003). Simultaneously testing distance \nbetween woods, hedgerow and woodland cover showed that hedgerow was more important than the \n  10 \nregional extent of woodland cover in explaining synchrony for Hedge Accentor, Blackcap and Common \nBlackbird (Bellamy et al. 2003). \nSynchrony has been interpreted as indicative of greater metapopulation vulnerability and \nhence, by inference, as a potentially negative effect (Bellamy et al. 2003). However, we argue the \nopposite interpretation, that synchrony among fragmented woodland bird populations indicates good \nconnectivity, the potential for rescue effects and rapid recolonisation of vacant fragments, and thus \nreduced regional vulnerability. In classic metapopulation theory, long term persistence occurs because \nasynchrony among local populations reduces the risk of overall metapopulation extinction. In spatially \nexplicit metapopulation models with area-dependent extinction and isolation-dependent colonisation \nprobabilities, \u2018regional stochasticity\u2019 (where patches within a region experience synchronous variation in \nlocal extinction or colonisation rates) increases the chance of metapopulation extinction, even in \nlandscapes with more and better connected habitat patches (Hanski 1998). Similarly, other theoretical \ntreatments also predict that synchrony among spatially structured populations connected by dispersal \nincreases the likelihood of global extinction (Allen et al. 1993; Heino et al. 1997).  However, Paradis et \nal. (1999), Paradis et al. (2002) and Bellamy et al. (2003) first remove regional or national population \ntrends between years, that result from environmental change or weather effects throughout extensive \nregions (i.e. the \u2018regional stochasticity\u2019 of Hanski), before examining the \u2018local synchrony\u2019 in residual \npopulation variation among sites.  Thus in the study system of Bellamy et al. (2003) synchronous \nchanges in population size was due to weather, while local asynchrony could arise from delayed \nrecovery following local extinction or reduction. Local asynchrony in bird populations may therefore be \nviewed as a symptom of a landscape with impeded dispersal that increases global population \nvulnerability. \nFor Blue Tit, the probability of breeding is higher in small woods with a greater amount of \nhedgerow in the surrounding landscape (Hinsley et al. 1995). In analysis of extinction probability for \neight woodland species, the most important factor was either woodland area or the number of pairs \nbreeding within the woodland (Bellamy et al. 1996b). However, isolation and local connectivity were \nalso important in the probability of local extinction of a few species. For Blue Tit, probability of extinction \nwas lower in woodlands with more hedges connected to the woodland (in one of two years analysed), \nfor Chaffinch the length of hedgerow within 1 km was important (in both years), while for Great Tit the \nprobability of local extinction was greater in more isolated woods (in one of two years analysed) \n(Bellamy et al. 1996b). \nFor three species of woodland bird (Great Spotted Woodpecker, Wood Nuthatch, Marsh Tit), \npresence at a scale of 10 km x 10 km within England is primarily related to the amount of semi-natural \nand ancient woodland, but also to measures of fragmentation (Bailey et al. 2002). However, the use of a \nprincipal component approach in this study meant that effects of woodland isolation (e.g. mean distance \nto nearest ancient woodland) could not be distinguished from effects of connectivity (e.g. hedgerow \ndensity) and mean semi-natural woodland patch size. For 68 small woodlots in two agricultural \nlandscapes in the Netherlands, the number of woodland bird species (those restricted to mature woods) \n  11 \nwas affected by isolation (inter-patch distance and distance to extensive woodland) while the total \nnumber of breeding bird species was not affected (Opdam et al. 1985). Across 235 small woodlots in \nthe Netherlands (ranging from 0.1 to 39 ha), the number of woodland bird species was primarily related \nto wood area and secondarily to isolation variables, including amount of woodland area within the \nvicinity, distance to nearest large woodland and the density of wooded banks within 3 km (van Dorp & \nOpdam 1987). However, species specific models for the incidence of woodland specialist birds \ngenerally showed effects of landscape composition (amount of woodland, distance to large woodland) \nbut no effects of connectivity (density of wooded banks) (van Dorp & Opdam 1987). \nFor invertebrate and plant species, targeted use of agri-environment measures and semi-\nnatural habitats is assumed to improve matrix permeability and reduce the functional isolation of \nwoodland fragments (Watts et al. 2005a, Watts et al. 2005b). However, it is unclear to what extent this \nwould also apply to woodland birds. Although a number of studies have considered effects of \nconnectivity in terms of linear elements such as hedgerows or wooded banks, few have considered the \nbroader question of whether the intensity of matrix landuse effects woodland bird dispersal and thus \nfunctional isolation. Walker et al. (2005) found green lanes, comprising double hedges that encompass \nan uncultivated trackway, supported greater species richness and abundance of birds than single \nhedgerows. Surrounding landuse affected bird occurrence on green lanes and both abundance and \nspecies richness were greater inside than outside green lanes. Although the influence of adjacent \nlanduse on rates of dispersal were not examined, lower species richness and abundance can be \nassumed to reduce potential for connectivity. \nOverall, there is thus some evidence that for some ubiquitous and edge species, connectivity \nbetween woodlands is important in rescuing populations, buffering against local extinction and favouring \npopulation synchrony. However, landscapes are generally more connected for habitat generalists than \nfor habitat specialists (Dolman & Fuller 2003) and the manner in which woodland specialists disperse \nrequires further study. For woodland specialists, isolation is important; small woodlands have greater \nvalue if located near to existing large woodlands. However, direct buffering of existing large woods \nremains a better option. \n \nWithin-site heterogeneity and configuration \n \nThe simple dichotomy contrasting wooded patches in a sea of open habitat is intuitively appealing in \nterms of island biogeography or metapopulation dynamics. However, individual woodlands recognised \nat one scale contain internal patchy landscapes, with internal heterogeneity, structural patchiness, \njuxtaposition and configuration of elements. Examples arising by natural processes include natural \ntreefalls, larger openings caused by disturbance that may be maintained as glades, but also patches of \nsurviving trees within larger windfalls (Dolman & Fuller 2003). In amenity woodlands or wooded \nparkland there may be a complex arrangement of patches of tree cover and open space, while in other \n  12 \nmanaged woodlands structural patchiness can arise through planting composition, soil conditions, \naspect, coppice panels or clear-fell coupes. \nSuch internal patchiness may have major consequences for habitat quality for woodland birds; \nthe area, shape and arrangement of patches can affect suitability. For example, in coniferous \nplantations managed by clear-felling and restocking, Wood Lark density is greatest in young stands of \n2-4 ha and decreases significantly in stands larger than 8 ha (Evans 2002). Conversely, Pied \nFlycatchers in mixed forest in Finland preferentially settle in larger forest stands; density is higher in \nstands greater than 1 ha while stands < 5 ha are settled later and contain a higher proportion of \nunpaired males (Huhta et al. 1998). When individual patches are smaller than a territory, gap crossing \nduring nest provisioning incurs costs that reduce habitat quality. A time and energy model for Great Tit \nshowed that, with larger brood sizes or a high proportion of foraging trips involving gap-crossing, \nmaximum sustainable daily energy expenditure would be exceeded if gaps were larger than 50-100 m \n(Hinsley 2000). \n \nWoodland configuration and edge effects \n \nWoodland size, configuration and internal heterogeneity lead to edge effects that can influence \necological processes and habitat quality. Here we briefly review some mechanisms that may be \nimportant in woodland birds. \nThere is a common presumption to regard edges as degraded habitats. However, edges may \nprovide a valuable landscape element distinct from woodland interior. For example in Poland, edges of \npine (Pinus sylvestris) forest adjacent to farmland support a third greater species richness than the \nforest interior (> 200 m from the edge) (Cieslak 1992). Species occurring at higher density at the edge \nincluded those normally associated with scrub and those feeding in open habitats outside the forest \n(e.g. Red-backed Shrike Lanius collurio, Yellowhammer, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris), and also \nwoodland species (Eurasian Golden Oriole Oriolus oriolus, Icterine Warbler, Spotted Flycatcher). In \ncontrast, Common Chiffchaff and European Robin had higher densities in the forest interior. In \nconiferous plantations in the Belgian Ardennes, a greater number of species showed significant \nassociation with internal edges (Blackcap, Common Chiffchaff, Willow Warbler, Firecrest Regulus \nignicapillus, European Robin, Winter Wren, Coal Tit, Hedge Accentor, Garden Warbler Sylvia borin, \nTree Pipit, Great Spotted Woodpecker) than external edges (Great Tit, Common Wood Pigeon \nColumba palumbus, Common Blackbird, Carrion Crow Corvus corone, Blue Tit) while few were \nassociated with interior forest (Goldcrest, Common Crossbill Loxia curvirostra) (Fautsch et al. 2003). In \nmixed deciduous old forest in Lithuania, higher bird densities occurred close to internal forest edges \nadjacent to clearcuts, with edge effects penetrating up to 90-120 m at mid-aged and old edges \n(Brazaitis et al. 2005). \n \n  13 \nAccess to open habitats abutting woodland is important to some species that show a \npreference for external edges. Athough the growth and structure of trees and shrubs at woodland edges \n(both external and around clearings) contrasts to that of interior habitats, we found very few studies that \nexplicitly compared the structure of edge to interior in European woodlands. However, the expectation \nthat deciduous forest edges form distinct, structurally complex, shrub habitats with greater shrub layer \ndevelopment is supported by studies of deer home range size (Sa\u00efd & Servanty 2005). In north \nAmerica, higher abundance of flycatchers and chickadees within 25 m of forest edge was attributed to \nwell-developed foliage layers (Strelke & Dickson 1980). Similarly, Marsh Tits benefit from a complex \nshrub layer (Hinsley & Bellamy 2001). Flowering and fruiting may be greater in unshaded edge habitats \nthan shaded interiors. For example, in montane pine forests of northeast Iberia, cone abundance is \ngreater on trees along forest edges than in forest interiors, resulting in larger Coal Tit group size \n(Brotons & Herrando 2003). In Pennsylvania, autumn fruit availability is higher in mature forest-\nagricultural edge and early successional shrub-sapling habitats than in mature forest interior, making \nthese habitats important to migrating forest birds (Rodewald & Brittingham 2004). Edge effects may \nresult in higher abundance of arthropod prey. For example, both species richness and abundance of \nNeuroptera are greater at forest edges than interiors in Hungary, with 24% more species at steep edges \nand 60% more species at structurally rich edges compared to forest interior (Duelli et al. 2002). \nAs far as we are aware, the effect of adjacent landuse on the quality of woodland edge habitat \nfor birds has not been studied in Britain. \n \nEdge effects and large herbivore impacts \n \nPatch configuration may mediate the impacts of large herbivores on habitat structure. In Britain, as \nelsewhere in Europe and north America, increasing numbers of native and introduced deer species are \nhaving a major impact on forest structure (Fuller & Gill, 2001, Joys et al. 2004) with important \nconsequences for woodland birds (Fuller & Gill 2001).The arrangement of forest elements within the \nlandscape may affect their suitability for deer; in particular the fragmentation of forests into small \nwoodlands bordered by nutritious croplands is thought to contribute to the increase in deer numbers \n(Alverson et al. 1988, Sinclair 1997). This hypothesis has rarely been tested. In one study, conducted in \na large lowland conifer plantation forest in eastern England (200 km2), Muntjac Muntiacus reevesi \ndensity (controlling for stand composition) was higher in woodland blocks (500-3500 ha) with a greater \nratio of perimeter abutting open habitat, while no such relationship was found for Roe Deer Capreolus \ncapreolus (Hemami et al. 2005). \n \nEdge effects and nest predation \n \nWork conducted in North America has shown increased rates of nest predation close to forest \/ \nfarmland edges (Thompson, this issue). However, caution is advised in extending such findings to the \n  14 \nUK. Effects of landscape structure on rates of nest predation vary among landscapes and regions and \nmay also be species-specific (Lahti 2001). Furthermore, the behavioural response of a single predator \nspecies to landscape may differ between regions. For example, in North America Grey Squirrels \nSciurus carolinensis are considered woodland specialists, but are landscape generalists in Britain. \nSimilarly in Sweden the Eurasian Jay Garrulus glandarius is absent from small woodland fragments \n(Andr\u00e9n 1992) but may be more ubiquitous in Britain. Few generalisations have emerged, though edge \neffects are found more frequently in landscapes with a high degree of forest fragmentation (Lahti 2001).  \nCompared to North America, relatively few European studies have considered landscape \neffects on nest predation. In Scandinavian mixed forests, nest predation rates for Pied Flycatcher were \nnot related to stand area or distance to edge (Huhta et al. 1998). There is an urgent need for studies of \nedge effects within Britain, that compare nest predation rates in relation to landscape structure, patch \nsize and across boundaries between woodland\/farmland and woodland\/semi-natural habitat. Landscape \neffects are hard to predict, on the one hand specialist predator species such as Weasel Mustela nivalis \nmay be absent from smaller woods, whereas conversely generalist predators such as Hooded Crow \nCorvus cornix may operate more effectively in open\/edge landscapes or small woodlands (Andr\u00e9n \n1992). Predation rates on artificial nests rarely match those for real nests and the contribution of \ndifferent predator species can vary greatly (Burke et al. 2004, Moore & Robinson 2004, Robinson et al. \n2005, Thompson & Burhans 2004), we strongly recommend that studies should monitor real nests and \nidentify the predators involved. \n \nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: \n \nIn general, large woods support more species. Whilst generalist, matrix and edge species may occur in \nall woods, specialist woodland species such as Marsh Tit and Eurasian Treecreeper only occur \nregularly and in good numbers in larger woods (Table 5). However, smaller woods may be \nproportionately more valuable for a few edge species that benefit from access to open habitats, such as \nHedge Accentor and Common Blackbird. For poorly dispersing species, such as Wood Nuthatch and \nalso some generalists, woods must be close together for viable dispersal without mortality. There is \nevidence that hedgerows buffer woodland populations, but only for a few ubiquitous, generalist and \nedge species that have virtually continuous populations extending throughout the matrix. For poorly \ndispersing species, large core areas can sustain populations while the same area of woodland \ndistributed across isolated fragments does not. The total area of habitat required to sustain a viable \npopulation is much less when configured in a network that includes one or more large, core patches. \nPriority should be placed on protecting, managing, creating, expanding and buffering large \nwoods and large core areas, but also in providing overall heterogeneity of wood sizes, including small \nwoods. The quality of woodland habitat is of overwhelming importance and in most studies explains \nmore variance than landscape scale effects. It is therefore important to promote old growth structures; \nbut also young growth, scrub and internal edges. Heterogeneity of within-site structures should be \n  15 \nprovided, but not necessarily within the same site. It is more useful to provide woodland habitat \nheterogeneity within regions, than to attempt to provide a small amount of each habitat type within each \nwoodland site. \nIndividual woods are more valuable in landscapes with a greater amount of wooded area, \nsupporting an emphasis on regional woodland networks and aggregations. Woodland fragmentation \nhas a very long history in the UK, while declines in woodland birds are more recent. However, \nagricultural intensification may have affected the quality and permeability of landscapes surrounding \nwoodland fragments and the availability of semi-natural habitats that may buffer woodland bird \npopulations. \nThis review has demonstrated that responses of an individual bird species to landscape \nstructure can vary among regions, however, very few studies have examined the effects of landscape \nstructure on woodland birds within the UK (findings summarised in Table 5). There is a need for further \nstudies of the effects of woodland habitat quality, configuration, landscape composition and matrix \nstructure for the viability and functional connectivity of woodland bird populations. There is also a need \nfor further spatially explicit modelling of a wider range of species, to test alternative scenarios of \nstrategic policy across a range of landscape types.  \n \nREFERENCES \nAdriaensen, F., Chardon, J.P., De Blust, G., Swinnen, E., Villalba, S., Gulinck, H. & Matthysen, E. \n2003.
