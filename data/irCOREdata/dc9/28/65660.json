Gossip is not just individual, making \nand blighting careers, but also institutional - about which departments are looking \nstronger than 'rivals' and so forth. In marked contrast to all the claims for excellence \nacademics are drilled to write, it is in the arena of gossip that insecurity abounds; \ninsecurity and a good dose of misinformation, half-truths, and Chinese whispers. It \nwas in the context of such discussions about postgraduate recruitment that I pondered \nthe myths and stories circulating. So what I want to do is present some of the collated \nofficial figures in a naive description of how many postgraduates are where. The \nmaterial is all gleaned from official and public sources -- though sometimes not \nreadily available public sources. They need all the usual caveats about official \nstatistics, especially those derived from returns to Funding Councils where institutions \nhave a financial interest in generating as high a number as they can. Of course, these \nfigures are less the answer to rumours than the start of new rounds of speculation. I \nhope they are of interest to UK-based scholars and those overseas who may from time \nto time be writing references or advising students on places to go. While the details \nmay be specific, the UK is not alone in drives to measure performance and assess \nrelative standing (see, for instance, Kong, 1999). The nature of the indicators vary \nlargely to suit the authors -- so whereas in the UK 'research student' numbers are \nregarded by state funding bodies as an indicator of 'research output' (sic), other \ninstitutions in other countries have devised global league tables which omit research \nstudents altogether. I do not propose to begin to unpack what the correct criteria might \nbe for such measures. The point is that through their existence they shape policy and \npractice in departments which either believe them or are compelled to play games \naccording to those rules. Given that situation, this small piece inevitably plays a dual \nrole in both outlining some 'results' and feeding back in to the process. I want to start \nwith a brief sketch of the recent exercises and reviews and their effect on the climate \nof postgraduate research in the UK, which may be all too familiar to some, then look \nat the figures for both total numbers, and, more relevantly to this journal, the \ndistribution of centrally state funded social science students.  \nTrends and pressures: grounds for speculation \nUK higher education, like the rest of the public sector, has become driven by an audit \nculture which seeks a more and more fine-grained analysis of performance. In the \nabsence of 'market indicators' a whole raft of other forms of indicators have been \ndeveloped. Universities are responding to pressures from outside funding bodies \nwhich are themselves having to account for the disbursement of public funds. The \nstate funded research councils, led by the Economic and Social Research Council \n(ESRC), adopted a sanctions policy in the late 1980s based on thesis-completion rates. \nFailure to get, at that time, 40% of PhD students to submit (not, interestingly, to pass) \nwithin 4 years of their commencing led to institutions being blacklisted and barred \nfrom receiving new recruits. Logically anywhere with two or fewer students in a \ncohort, had to ensure both submitted on schedule or face sanctions. The ESRC has \npersistently repeated that it regards completion rates as an indicator of good \nsupervision (and, implicitly, does not care with others think). Recently both the ESRC \nand the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) have moved to a 70% \ncompletion rate figure. \n    This squeeze at the completion end of the process is matched by a progressive \nintroduction of 'research training' requirements at the commencement of postgraduate \nresearch. The ESRC requires that 60% of the first year of a PhD should be 'training'. \nThat is, something around 960 student hours, or 29 full weeks, of learning activities \nshould be devoted to a prescribed range of skills training in research methods, current \nideas in social science and geography, and so forth. The model is implicitly that this is \nthe equivalent to the taught component of a one-year masters degree. Let me leave \naside the squeeze on PhD students and look at how this training is assessed. In an \namazingly effective piece of leverage, the ESRC (which funds nationally around 30 \nstudents through this scheme each year), imposed 'recognition criteria' that all human \ngeography students not just the ones it funded, had to undergo this training or it would \nnot allow anyone at the institution to apply for a state studentship. Every four years \nthe ESRC conducts a recognition exercise, demanding something in the order of a 24-\npage form to outline the research training and how it meets the criteria established. \nOne of the criteria is 'research culture' in part indicated by number of PhD students \nregistered. In the last exercise in 1998, some 30 departments applied -- already a self-\nselection by those that thought either the application or putting on a training course \nworth the cost. Out of these some 25 were recognised to take students from \nundergraduate to doctorate.(1) In the last exercise there were some notable absentees, \nthough currently an 'interim' recognition process may increase the number once more. \n    One response has been to create masters courses that meet the recognition criteria \nand thus prequalify candidates who go on to PhDs and exempt them from most further \ntraining courses -- so-called Research Training (RT) status. Out of 35 'geography' \nmasters courses noted, the ESRC recognised 7 as meeting RT status and allocated \nfunded places to 6.(2) In summary, then, the speculation is that these factors are \nleading to a concentration of students in larger, already successful, departments, that \ncan boast large numbers of students already and have the ability and resource to invest \nin providing research training courses. \nPattern of postgraduate study \nFirst a word about the data. Two main sources are available. Relatively simple is the \nESRC data, which allow a listing of all human geography' studentships it currently \nfunds. It is then a matter of simply, if tediously, extracting each one and looking at \nwhere it is held. The data used here are students funded in the academic year 1999 -\n 2000, that is those starting between 1997 and 1999.(3) Previously funded students \nnow in their fourth year are not included in these figures. It includes awards in open \ncompetition and those held 'collaboratively' with part funding from nonacademic \npartners. It counts those submitted to the human geography competition but thus \nmisses those who may be considered 'geographical' in other categories, and those who \nmay be in other cognate departments (say development studies) but entered other \ncompetitions. It also misses the 'arts' awards in geography from the British Academy \nand its successor, the Humanities Research Board. The second set of data is returns to \n'research activity surveys', which feed in to funding formulae, from Higher Education \nFunding Councils. Those for England and Northern Ireland have data for 1997 - 98 \nand 1998 - 99, available publicly, while Scotland and Wales supplied data upon \nrequest with the former based on 1997 - 98. These data also cast their net more \nwidely. The surveys measure 'research students' which includes PhD students, MPhil \nstudents(4), and those doing 'research masters' (which are conducted through \nindependent study rather than taught components). It needs to be borne in mind then \nthat some institutions effectively are listing only or mostly PhD students while others \nhave sometimes large contingents of students in other categories boosting their overall \nfigures. There is also some ambiguity about what 'institution' means, with some \ndepartments entered as two different 'schools' and other schools amalgamated \ndepending on faculty structures. This wider measure reflects that research council \nfunding supports only a proportion -- and indications from these data are about one \nfifth -- of research students. \n    In light of these problems -- and the possibility of devising other categories which \ncould be significant (say numbers of taught masters students, total PhD registration) \nthe following needs a healthy dose of salt. It should also be added that where two \nyears are recorded there is a fair amount of volatility, given the small numbers in each \ninstitution (the highest shift being an increase of 89% year on year, and 8 institutions \nin the England and Northern Ireland data show fluctuations of over one third year to \nyear). \n    In terms of the numbers of institutions there are 69 centres returning entries in the \nRAE (Research Assessment Exercise), with 47 'geography' institutions on Funding \nCouncil data with research students and currently 28 hosting ESRC students.(5) This is \nunsurprising given that university-funded awards are likely to be spread more evenly \nthan external funds. In terms of concentration, over 50% of all ESRC awards went to \nfour institutions (see table 1). Perhaps a more useful way of dividing the institutions \nwould be to say three have over fifteen students (that is, more than five per year), then \nthere follows another group of nine each of which has three or more -- so on average \none award or more per year. It is remarkable here that Oxford lost its recognition two \nyears ago and so this number is a legacy effect from before then. The remaining \nsixteen institutions have fewer than one per year (pro rata) -- and at least two are \nprobably affected by loss of recognition. The data could be sliced in other ways (say \nseparating the three institutions averaging two or more per year, but fewer than five). \nGiven that these awards are based on a series of open competitions, the degree of \nconcentration is perhaps greater than expected. It is in part a concentration by \nreputation where the topics for study suggest the role of key individuals and themes \nfor institutions -- they are awarded studentships in what gossip would say are their \nstrong fields. Given that proposals go to a panel of expert assessors who have to \ninclude an assessment of how the proposal fits with the institution this is perhaps to be \nexpected, but perhaps also a little depressing in terms of encouraging innovation.  \nTable 1.

The most up-\nto-date figures from funding councils record 1079 full-time equivalent research \nstudents in geography (human and physical) in the UK offering a mean size of \ntwenty-three research students per institution. Only nineteen institutions have \ngraduate communities of that size or larger, with the top twelve departments \ncontributing over half of the total (see table 2). The lowest ranking for a RAE grade \n5* department is 14th, and the lowest grade 5 is 15th. Only three departments not \ngrade 5 and above make it into the top fifteen. There are several grade 4 departments \nwhich feature down the list. We can speculate on the causes of the pattern, including \navailable university funds, overseas recognition for the university as well as the \ndepartment, the nomenclature and popularity of research degrees other than PhDs, and \nso on. We also need two cautionary notes regarding what effects we are seeing. First, \nwe are simply ranking by size of graduate school -- relating these to numbers of staff \nproduces a rather different picture of effort. I am wary that the staff figures are not \nentirely commensurate with the student figures and are currently publicly available \nfor the English institutions, but they indicate a range of more than three research \nstudents per staff member at the highest loadings. Some of the larger numbers of \nstudents then get offset by large department size but this is not universal. A further \nstudy, looking at staff working might compare the balances of postgraduate and \nundergraduate funding and teaching going on here. It should also be made clear as a \nsecond reservation that research students feed in to the RAE scoring process, so these \nare linked not independent variables. \nTable 2.

It is also likely to feed into this not only by \ninforming, or misinforming, decisions about institutional priorities, but may also \ninfluence potential research students. The indication about research council awards \nmay be particularly appealing, but of course the figures here are not the success rate. \nThere are no data on numbers of applications from institutions which were rejected, or \nwhat topics they proposed to study. However, the pattern does seem clear. This raises \na few questions which the discipline needs to address collectively rather than \ncompetitively. First, what are the costs and benefits of research council students -- at \nwhat bottom threshold does it make (financial) sense to give up the game? Of course \nin terms of staff morale, attracting applications who may get internal funding, and so \nforth, there may be other reasons to justify playing the research council game. Second, \nwhat are the implications of concentration. Certainly the research councils make a \ncogent argument that a critical mass of other students helps the research process by \nproviding an intellectual peer group and research culture. But what is that level? If we \nfollow this are we moving to a situation of only a handful of departments hosting \nstudents? And what are the implications of that for the rest of the discipline? What are \nthe implications for students not in these centres of graduate study? At the moment \nthe counterbalancing trend is evident in the general numbers of research students, but \nthese are concentrated broadly along research-selectivity criteria. To an extent this \nmay be inevitable and desirable, if we say research ranking follows good research, \nand students use good research and publications to guide their choice of supervisors. \nPerhaps we need to address these sorts of debates, thinking through the implications \nrather than allowing institutional self-interest, competition, insecurity, and anxious \ngossip to drive the process. \nMike Crang  \nDurham University  \nFootnotes \n(1)There is a rangeof recognition categories -- differing for part-time and full-time \nstudents, collaborative students, and recognition for students who have already \ncompleted a 'recognised' course of research training.
