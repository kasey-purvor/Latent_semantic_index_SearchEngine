The states of up to 6 interacting\nelectrons in such a dot are calculated by exact diagonalisation of a 2-band, effective mass Hamil-\ntonian. The addition energy and the few electron density are investigated for a wide range of dots\nwith different physical properties and, in a large proportion of these dots, the electrons are found\nto form Wigner molecules.\nIntroduction. \u2013 It is now possible to form one di-\nmensional quantum dots from high quality semiconduct-\ning carbon nanotubes [1]. Quantum dots are tunable arti-\nficial atoms that provide an ideal laboratory for exploring\nthe physics of atoms and molecules and have many po-\ntential applications, for example in quantum computing.\nAs dots can be used to controllably confine small num-\nbers of charge carriers they have stimulated much interest\nin the quantum states of a few interacting electrons. One\ndimensional nanotube (NT) dots are, however, very differ-\nent to the 2D semiconductor dots that have been used to\nstudy effects such as the formation of all electron (Wigner)\nmolecules [2, 3] and electronic shell filling analogous to\nthat observed in atoms [4]. The reduced dimensionality\nof NT dots alters the form of the effective Coulomb inter-\naction [5], it affects the allowed symmetries of the states [6]\nand the types of confinement that can be engineered.\nIn particular, NT dots can be used to fabricate room\ntemperature single electron transistors because of the large\nsingle particle level spacings which can be engineered [7].\nThey are promising candidates for spin qubits [8] and also\nexhibit interesting shell filling effects due to the approx-\nimately degenerate [8] K,K \u2032 sub-bands. This has been\nexamined in detail in metallic NT dots [9, 10] but, only\nrecently has it been possible to accurately measure the\naddition energy [1] or the differential conductance [11] of\nsemiconducting NT dots.\nIn the Coulomb blockade [4] regime the occupancy of\nall types of NT dot can be controlled to the level of a\nsingle electron. Importantly, however, semiconductor NT\ndots can be completely emptied of electrons [1]. In marked\ncontrast to metallic NT dots, semiconductor NT dots can\ntherefore contain just a few interacting particles. To un-\nderstand this technologically important system it is nec-\nessary to add detailed modelling of the electronic states\nto the existing experimental measurements, and the work\ndescribed here is motivated by this.\nIn this Letter we develop a 2-band effective mass Hamil-\ntonian H with a modified coulomb interaction that de-\nscribes the interacting electrons in a semiconducting NT\ndot. We write H in dimensionless form, diagonalise it\nexactly for up to 6 electrons and investigate the inter-\nacting electron states over all of the physically accessi-\nble region of the dimensionless parameter space. We find\nthat electron-electron correlation is always important in\nsemiconducting NT dots and this has implications for the\ninterpretation of experimental addition energy data [1].\nAlmost nowhere are the electrons sufficiently weakly cor-\nrelated for the Hartree-Fock theory to be accurate. In-\nstead we see evidence for the formation of quasi-1D all\nelectron molecules over a surprisingly large proportion of\nthe parameter space. Unlike most inorganic semiconduc-\ntor dots, it should therefore be possible to fabricate an\nNT dot in the 1D strongly correlated limit. And, un-\nlike semiconductor nanowire dots [12] (which might also\nbe fabricated in this limit) the physics of the NT dot is\nnot complicated by edge effects. At present, NT dots are\nperhaps the only semiconductor dots in which quasi-1D\nWigner molecules can both be accurately modelled and\nexperimentally probed.\np-1\nM. Roy and P. A. Maksym\nDot Model. \u2013 Our dot model is based on the gated\nsemiconductor NT dot device in ref. [1]. In this type of dot\nthe confinement potential is electrostatic and soft walled\n[1, 13]. The details depend on the exact specifications of\nthe device but, near to the centre of the NT, the potential\nvaries quadratically with a gate voltage dependent energy\nzero, and we use a 1D harmonic confinement potential in\nour model. Typically, the dot length scales are of the order\nof a few tens of nanometres and the dot energy scales are a\nfew, to a few tens, of meV. We consider NTs with a band\ngap Eg much larger than this energy scale and a unit cell\nlength much smaller than this length scale. This type of\ndot can be described with an effective mass Hamiltonian.\nHowever, there are new features that arise from the NT\nbandstructure and these can be understood by considering\nthe electronic structure of graphene.\nTheory. \u2013 NTs are rolled up graphene sheets and the\nNT states near to the conduction band (CB) minima are\nformed from the states of graphene near to the K and K \u2032\npoints. However, care must be taken when deriving the\nNT states because of the unusual nature of the graphene\nbandstructure near to K and K \u2032: first, the K and K \u2032\npoints are equivalent and this leads to two equivalent CBs\nin all semiconducting NTs (we neglect the very small spin\norbit splitting [8]); second, the dispersion near to each\nof the graphene K and K \u2032 points is linear. To derive\nthe NT dot states we follow a procedure similar to refs.\n[14, 15] and use the two component Bloch wavefunctions\nof graphene as basis states. This introduces new features\ninto our effective mass theory for interacting electrons in\na NT quantum dot. The net result is a one dimensional 2-\nband effective mass Hamiltonian with a modified Coulomb\ninteraction,\nH =\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[\u2212h\u00af2\n2m\u2217\nd2\ndz2i\n+\nm\u2217\u03c92\n2\nz2i\n]\n+\n\u03c1\/R\n2\u01ebr\n\u2211\ni6=j\nU(zi \u2212 zj, R).\n(1)\nHere N is the number of electrons, \u03c9 is the harmonic con-\nfinement frequency, R is the NT radius, \u01ebr the dielectric\nconstant and \u03c1 = e2\/(4\u03c0\u01ebo). The effective mass m\n\u2217 is\ncalculated from a 4-orbital tight binding calculation with\nthe parameterisation of Porezag et al. [16]. \u03c1U\/\u01ebr is the\neffective intraband Coulomb interaction. This effective in-\nteraction includes the effect of both the NT band structure\nand the cylindrical geometry of the tube. Here, we neglect\nthe interband Coulomb scattering because its effect on the\nN -particle ground state energy is small [5]. In this case\nthe band index acts simply as an extra label by which\nstates can be distinguished (a \u2019pseudospin\u2019).\nTo derive our expressions for H and U we first con-\nsider the single particle NT effective mass equations\nstarting from the Hamiltonian of a graphene sheet. In\ntwo component form the graphene states are (\u03c6Ak +\n(\u22121)\u00b5e\u0131\u03b8k\u03c6Bk)\/\n\u221a\n2 where \u00b5 = 1, 0 for the valence or con-\nduction band, \u03c6Ak and \u03c6Bk are the Bloch functions of\nthe A, B sub-lattices of graphene and k is measured from\nthe K or K \u2032 point. The co-ordinate axes have been ro-\ntated so that the NT chiral vector points along y, and\nz is the direction of the tube. Then, the phase factor\n\u03b8k is the sum of the chiral angle \u03b8 and the polar an-\ngle \u03c6k of k. In a NT k is quantised and the product\nof the envelope function and the Bloch function is peri-\nodic [15]: kyR = n \u2212 \u03bd\/3 where \u03bd = \u00b11 and n is an\ninteger. In an external potential v, the NT states, writ-\nten as a superposition of the Bloch states at K, are then\n\u03c8(y, z) =\n\u2211\nn\u00b5kz\nan\u00b5kze\n\u0131k\u00b7r\n(\n\u03c6AK + (\u22121)\u00b5e\u0131\u03b8k\u03c6BK\n)\n\/\n\u221a\n2,\nand there is an equivalent expression for states near K \u2032.\nThe key steps to develop our theory are as follows. First,\nbecause our confinement potential is 1 dimensional the\ncoupling between NT bands of different ky vanishes. Sec-\nond, Eg \u226b h\u00af\u03c9, so we neglect the coupling between con-\nduction and valence bands. It is physically reasonable that\nthis cross gap perturbation is small: our confinement po-\ntential binds electrons and repels holes and so the overlap\nbetween these states is small. To first order, the coupling\nis zero and, we have estimated the second order correction\nand it is small (\u2248 10\u22123 meV).\nWe now have an uncoupled Schro\u00a8dinger equation for\neach n, \u00b5 band, \u01ebkzakz +\n\u2211\nk\u2032\nz\n(1 + e\u0131(\u03b8k\u2032\u2212\u03b8k))vkz\u2212k\u2032zak\u2032z =\nEakz . This is similar to the momentum space effective\nmass equation of motion in a parabolic band, except it\ncontains a term involving the phase factor, \u03b8k = \u03b8 +\narctan(kz\/ky). For the n = 0, \u00b5 = 0 CB, ky = 1\/(3R)\nand, as the NT dot length scale is much larger than R, we\ncan expand the phase dependent term in powers of kz\/ky.\nFor any real symmetric potential, the effect of the phase\nterm on the single particle energy is zero to first order.\nTo second order the correction for a harmonic potential\nis a constant energy shift of < 0.1 meV which we ne-\nglect. However, although the phase has negligible effect on\nthe single particle energy, it introduces an offset between\nthe envelope functions F that multiply the A and B sub-\nlattice Bloch states: the total wavefunction is \u03c8(y, z) =\neikyy\n(\nF (z)\u03c6AK + e\n\u0131\u03b8F (z + 3R)\u03c6BK\n)\n\/(2\n\u221a\n2\u03c0R). The in-\nteraction potential U is found by taking matrix elements\nof the Coulomb interaction between these states. So, as-\nsuming the Coulomb interaction is slowly varying on the\nlength scale of the graphene cell,\nU(z,R) =\n1\n4\n(2u(z,R) + u(z \u2212 3R,R) + u(z + 3R,R))\nu(z,R) =\n2R\n\u03c0\n\u221a\nz2 + 4R2\nK\n(\n2R\u221a\nz2 + 4R2\n)\n, (2)\nwhere z = zi \u2212 zj and K is an elliptic integral of the first\nkind. In Eq. 2, u(z,R) is derived from the standard form\nof the interaction between charged particles on the sur-\nface of a cylinder and diverges like log(R\/z) as z \u2192 0.\nThe terms u(z \u2212 3R,R) and u(z + 3R,R) in the effective\ninteraction arise from the phase difference between Bloch\nstates on the A and B sub-lattices of graphene. This form\nof the interaction does not occur in traditional semicon-\nductor quantum dots. It is a consequence of the form of\nthe nanotube band structure which, in turn comes from\np-2\nSemiconducting carbon nanotube quantum dots\nthe physical lattice structure of graphene and the fact that\nthe graphene is rolled up to form the tube.\nSo far we have considered the CB constructed from\nstates near K but we can also write down equivalent equa-\ntions for states near K \u2032. The K and K \u2032 CBs are coupled\nby the Coulomb interaction, but the effective interband\ninteraction is small [5] and we neglect it. Our Hamilto-\nnian is block diagonal in the total spin. As we ignore the\ninterband interaction it is also block diagonal in the total\npseudospin and, interestingly, the 2-electron spin 1 and\nspin 0 ground states are degenerate [5].\nCalculation. \u2013 To calculate the few electron states\nwe first write H in dimensionless form by choosing the\nunit of energy as Eu =\n[\n\u03c12m\u2217\u03c92\/\u01eb2r\n] 1\n3 and the unit of\nlength as \u03bb =\n[\n\u03c1\/(\u01ebrm\n\u2217\u03c92)\n] 1\n3 . Then, with x = z\/\u03bb, and\ndimensionless parameters, \u03b13 =\n[\n\u03c12m\u2217\/(h\u00af3\u01eb2r\u03c9)\n]2\nand \u03b2 =\nR\/\u03bb,\nH \u2032 =\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[\u22121\n2\u03b1\nd2\ndx2i\n+\n1\n2\nx2i\n]\n+\n1\n2\n\u2211\ni6=j\nU(xi \u2212 xj , \u03b2). (3)\nWe diagonalise H \u2032 in a basis of determinantal harmonic\noscillator functions to an accuracy of 0.1%. Within our ap-\nproximations, H \u2032 describes the interacting electron states\nfor a parabolic dot in any NT, with any confinement fre-\nquency and any dielectric constant in terms of \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nHere, we consider only the region of the parameter space\nin which h\u00af\u03c9 and \u01ebr take physically reasonable values for\nthe range of NTs with 0.2 < R < 1.7 nm (1 < h\u00af\u03c9 < 50\nmeV and 1 < \u01ebr < 7).\nResults. \u2013 By examining the electron density (fig. 1)\nwe identify different regimes of behaviour: in the strongly\ncorrelated regime (solid line) the Coulomb interaction\ndominates the single particle confinement, the electrons\nare pushed apart and tend to form Wigner crystal-like\nstates with well defined peaks in the charge density for\neach electron. These states are similar to those studied\nin ref. [6] in a general 1D dot. In the \u2019weakly\u2019 corre-\nlated regime (dashed line) the interaction energy is slightly\nweaker than the single particle confinement energy and\nthe electrons are forced together in the centre of the dot.\nThere is also an intermediate regime (dotted line).\nThe transition between these regimes is primarily con-\ntrolled by \u03b1 which is analogous to a mass inH \u2032. Physically,\nincreasing \u03b1 at fixed m\u2217 and \u01ebr corresponds to reducing\nthe confinement h\u00af\u03c9. If \u03b1 is large the electrons localise\nat the lowest energy minima in the potential landscape\ndefined by the Coulomb repulsion and harmonic confine-\nment; it is energetically favourable for the electrons to\nform Wigner crystal-like states. If \u03b1 is small however, the\nkinetic energy is large and the electrons can no longer lo-\ncalise at the Wigner lattice points. They are then confined\nnear the centre of the dot by the harmonic potential. The\neffect of \u03b2 is less important.

However, because\nwe constrain the parameter space by limiting h\u00af\u03c9 and \u01ebr,\nthe range of allowed \u03b1 depends on \u03b2 and the different \u03b1\nregimes are only accessible at different \u03b2.\nThe physics in the different regimes of behaviour can\nbe studied quantitatively by comparing the exact calcu-\nlated 2-electron ground state energy E2 with the energies\nobtained with two different physical models. In the first\n(molecular) model we assume the electrons are strictly lo-\ncalised at Wigner crystal lattice sites. This approximation\nshould be good in the strongly correlated limit where the\ntunnelling between sites is small. In the second physi-\ncal model, which should be most accurate in the weakly\ncorrelated limit, we calculate the ground state within the\nHartree-Fock (HF) approximation with a harmonic oscil-\nlator single particle basis.\nTo calculate the 2-electron ground state energy within\nthe molecular approximation we writeH \u2032 in centre of mass\n(CM) and relative motion (RM), x\u2032 = (x1 \u2212 x2)\/\n\u221a\n2, co-\nordinates. The 2-electron Hamiltonian is then separable\nand the ground state eigenvalue of the CM part of H \u2032 is\n1\/(2\n\u221a\n\u03b1). We expand the RM potential to 2nd order in x\nabout its global minima, VRM (x\n\u2032) = x\u20322\/2+U(\n\u221a\n2x\u2032, \u03b2) \u2248\nVRM (x\n\u2032\no)+\u03b1\u03c9\n2\nRM (x\n\u2032\u2212x\u2032o)2\/2.The RM ground state energy\nis then VRM (x\n\u2032\no) + \u03c9RM\/2.\nIn fig. 2 (b) we see that the ground state energy in-\ncreases as \u03b1 is reduced and the kinetic energy term in H \u2032\ngrows larger. We can also see that the HF method gives\na poor approximation to E2. Even in the \u2019weakly\u2019 corre-\nlated regime (small \u03b1) the interaction is too strong for the\nHF approximation to be accurate. A common measure of\nthe interaction strength [1] is \u3008U\u3009\/(h\u00af\u03c9) where \u3008U\u3009 is the\nexpectation value of U(z,R). At best \u3008U\u3009\/(h\u00af\u03c9) = 0.8 and\nthe HF energy is still larger than E2 by 4%.\nFig. 2 (a) shows the difference between exact and molec-\nular calculations. As expected the molecular model is best\nat large \u03b1, but it is reasonably accurate over a surpris-\np-3\nM. Roy and P. A.

For all\n\u03b1 \u2265 2 it is accurate to within 2% and the electron states\nare Wigner molecule-like. In the Wigner molecule regime\n\u3008U\u3009\/(h\u00af\u03c9) > 1.17. Here, the approximation underesti-\nmates E2 because we have ignored the non-parabolicity\nof the potential at the global minima in VRM . In this\nregion the approximation is more accurate for high \u03b2: in-\ncreasing \u03b2 softens the walls of the barrier between minima\nin VRM and hence reduces the higher order terms in the\nexpansion of VRM . Although the molecular model cap-\ntures the essence of the physics, it ignores the possibility\nof tunnelling between minima. However if \u03b1 \u2265 2, the exact\nsplitting is always small (< 0.025E2) and the tunnelling\nprobability P is negligible: with the WKB approximation\nwe find P < 0.01.\nThe Addition Energy. \u2013 To make the connection\nto experiment we have also calculated the addition energy,\nEA(N) = EN+1 \u2212 2EN + EN\u22121. Jarillo-Herrero et al [1]\nrecently measured EA for a dot formed by gating a (35,0)\nsemiconducting NT. They found a 2-electron periodicity in\nEA with oscillations of a few meV. The magnitude of the\nmeasured EA decreased smoothly with N from roughly 45\nmeV at N=1.\nWe have calculated EA throughout the dimensionless\nspace (fig. 3 (a)). At small \u03b1, we see evidence for the\nexpected 4-electron periodicity that is a consequence of\nthe K,K \u2032 sub-band degeneracy and is often seen in NT\ndots [10, 11]. As \u03b1 increases the oscillations in EA get\nsmaller, but at large \u03b1 it is difficult to converge the ground\nstate energies for N \u2265 5 [17].\nIt is known that deformations or imperfections in the\nNT can split the two equivalent conduction bands [18]\nand, to obtain the 2-electron periodicity seen in ref. [1],\nwe must introduce such a splitting. In fig. 3 (c) we show\nthe qualitative consequences of adding a splitting \u03b4 into\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n\u03b4 = 0\n(a)\n1\n1.2\n1.4\nE A\n(N\n)\n\u03b4 \u2192 \u221e\n(b)\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1 2 3 4 5\nElectron number, N\n(c)\n\u03b1=0.88,  \u03b2=0.170\nFig. 3: Dimensionless addition energy, EA, calculated with 2\nbands (a) and 1 band (b).

If \u03b4 is small, then typically (but not always)\nincreasing \u03b4 increases the strength of the oscillations. If\n\u03b4 is large (> 0.6Eu) we can neglect the highest energy\nCB and the calculation simplifies to a 1-band form (fig. 3\n(b)). In this case we clearly see the different regimes of be-\nhaviour: in the strongly correlated regime (solid line) EA\nis featureless, oscillations begin to appear in the interme-\ndiate regime (dotted line) and become more pronounced\nwhen \u03b1 is small (dashed line).\nTo link these results to experiment we must set the\nenergy unit from the effective mass, confinement energy\nand dielectric constant of the experimental NT dot (m\u2217 =\n0.034 in a (35,0) NT). We assume that the confinement\npotential is fixed by the design of the device and that the\napplied gate voltage, which controls N , alters only the en-\nergy zero of the potential. As the data in ref. [1] shows a\n2-electron periodicity we focus on the 1-band results, we\nassume a relatively large \u03b4 introduced by some imperfec-\ntion or deformation [18] of the particular NT studied in\nref. [1].\np-4\nSemiconducting carbon nanotube quantum dots\nIn ref. [1] the NT dot confinement energy was deduced\nto be h\u00af\u03c9 = 4.3 meV with a constant interaction model\nthat is accurate in the weakly correlated limit. With this\nvalue in the calculation, we must set \u01ebr to be unphysically\nlow (\u01ebr \u2248 1) to reproduce the experimental energies. Also,\nwith h\u00af\u03c9 = 4.3 meV and \u01ebr = 1 (Eu = 25.9 meV) the cal-\nculated EA (fig. 3 (b), solid line) is featureless: it clearly\ndoes not have the oscillations of a few meV that were seen\nin the measurements. The problem lies with the constant\ninteraction model. This model does not work for NT dots\nbecause the effect of the Coulomb interaction is so large.\nIf a (35,0) NT dot device were fabricated with h\u00af\u03c9 = 4.3\nmeV, its quantum states would be extremely strongly cor-\nrelated and the N-electron density Wigner molecule-like\n(fig. 1: solid line) [19].\nThe electronic correlation is significant even in the\n\u2019weakly\u2019 correlated regime at small \u03b1. To match the oscil-\nlations observed in the experiment h\u00af\u03c9 must be much larger\nthan the 4.3 meV reported in ref. [1]. For example, with a\nmore physically reasonable value of the dielectric constant\n(\u01ebr = 6) and with h\u00af\u03c9 = 31.8 meV (giving Eu = 29.8 meV)\nwe obtain an addition energy curve (fig. 3 (b), dashed line)\nqualitatively similar to the experiment data. except that\nthe calculated EA falls slightly too quickly with N . How-\never, in a real device h\u00af\u03c9 will increase with increasing gate\nvoltage (or N) and this will reduce the slope in EA with\nN .\nConclusion. \u2013 In summary, we have developed a new\neffective mass theory of the interacting electron states in\nsemiconducting NT dots, and we have performed exact\ndiagonalisation calculations to examine the physics of the\ninteracting system in detail. In this letter we have shown\nthat correlation effects are important for almost all physi-\ncally reasonable semiconducting NT dots. Our calculated\naddition energies for N < 6 are qualitatively similar to\nexperiment and, by investigating the 2-electron states in\ndetail we find evidence of Wigner crystallisation in a large\nportion of the parameter space. NT dot devices operated\nin this regime would be ideal systems in which to observe\nquasi-1D Wigner molecules.\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge useful discussions with\nDr Y.
