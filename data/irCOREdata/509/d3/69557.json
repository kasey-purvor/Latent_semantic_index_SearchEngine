Introduction\n[2] Relativistic-electron dropouts are an integral aspect of\nthe behavior of the outer radiation belt during geomagnetic\nstorms. Early in a storm, the outer-electron-radiation-belt\nfluxes rapidly decrease (dropout) and later the fluxes rapidly\nreturn (recovery) [cf. Freeman, 1964; Nagai, 1988; Blake et\nal., 2001; Onsager et al., 2002; Green et al., 2004]. During\nthe dropouts the relativistic-electron fluxes can decrease by\ndecades [e.g., Kim and Chan, 1997; Li et al., 1997], as can\nthe relativistic-electron number densities [Borovsky et al.,\n1998a; Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006]. At geosynchronous\norbit dropouts begin at one location and spread in local time\n[Onsager et al., 2002] and have durations of 13 \u00b1 7 hours\n[Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006]. The cause of the dropouts\nis an outstanding issue for radiation-belt dynamics [Friedel\net al., 2002] and for high-speed-stream-driven storms\n[Kavanagh and Denton, 2007; Denton et al., 2008].\n[3] Some examples of relativistic-electron dropouts are\nshown in Figure 1 where relativistic-electron measurements\nfrom the spacecraft 1989\u2013046 in geosynchronous orbit\ncarrying the SOPA instrument [Belian et al., 1992] are\nshown for 200 days in 1993\u20131994 when repeating high-\nspeed-stream-driven storms were occurring. The top curve\nis the flux in the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron channel and the\nbottom curve is the number density of relativistic electrons\ndetermined with relativistic-Maxwellian fits to the measured\n30-keV to 2-MeV electron fluxes [cf. Cayton et al., 1989].\nRelativistic-electron dropouts are marked in red for both\ncurves. Note in Figure 1 that the relativistic-electron number\ndensities tend to be higher after dropouts then before,\nwhereas the relativistic-electron fluxes can be higher or\nlower (fluxes being a function of both the density and the\ntemperature of the relativistic electrons).\n[4] Relativistic-electron dropouts occur during the main\nphase of a storm, simultaneous with increases in Kp [Nagai,\n1988] and with the sharp drops of Dst [Nagai, 1988; Kim\nand Chan, 1997; Iles et al., 2002]. The relativistic-electron\ndropouts have been associated with the occurrence of the\nsuperdense plasma sheet [Borovsky et al., 1998a; Green et\nal., 2004] and with the occurrence of plasmaspheric drain-\nage plumes [Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006].

High-\nspeed-stream-driven storms [Burlaga and Lepping, 1977;\nTsurutani et al., 2006a, 2006b] are particularly interesting\nbecause of the robust outer-radiation-belt intensification\nover time in the days after recovery from dropout [e.g.,\nPaulikas and Blake, 1976; Reeves, 1998; Love et al., 2000;\nLam, 2004; Borovsky and Denton, 2006] [see also Rostoker\net al., 1998; Mathie and Mann, 2000]. High-speed-stream-\ndriven storms are also particularly amenable to study by\nsuperposed epoch methods [cf. McPherron and Weygand,\n2006; Denton et al., 2006; Denton and Borovsky, 2008a]\nbecause they have a repeating sequence of solar wind types\nthat pass the Earth. T (cf. Figure 1 of Richardson et al.\n[1996]): fast wind, rarefaction, slow wind, onset of CIR,\ncompressed slow wind (westward flow), sector reversal\nwithin the compressed slow wind, stream interface, com-\npressed fast wind (eastward flow), end of CIR, and again\nfast wind, rarefaction, . . . This sequence can be seen in the\nsketch of a CIR in Figure 2 with the temporal track of the\nEarth through h the CIR shown in green. This repeating\nsequence is listed in the first column of Table 1 where the\nchronology of relativistic-electron dropouts will be meshed\ninto the chronology of the solar wind and the magnetosphere.\n[6] Note that the storm time relativistic-electron dropouts\ndiscussed in this report are not to be confused with the brief\n(\u00011\/2 hour) energetic-particle dropouts seen in the nightside\nsector of geosynchronous orbit just prior to substorm particle-\ninjection events and global sawtooth oscillations [cf. Erickson\nand Winckler, 1973; Bogott and Mozer, 1973; Sauvaud and\nWinckler, 1980] which are caused by local extreme stretching\nof the magnetic field at geosynchronous orbit [e.g., Baker\nand McPherron, 1990; Thomsen et al., 1994; Sauvaud et al.,\n1996].\n[7] In this report we will use superposed epoch analysis\nof 124 high-speed-stream-driven storms to study relativistic-\nelectron dropouts and their association with solar wind and\nmagnetospheric processes. We aim to find out what the\nFigure 1. For 200 days in 1993\u20131994, the flux of 1.1\u2013\n1.5 MeV electrons as measured by the SOPA instrument\nonboard 1989-046 is plotted (top curve) and the relativistic-\nelectron number density determined by fits to the electron\nfluxes measured at all energies in the SOPA instrument\nonboard 1989\u2013046 is plotted (bottom curve). Relativistic-\nelectron dropouts are marked with the red letters. In the top\ncurve, the letter indicates whether the flux was higher (H),\nsimilar (S), or lower (L) immediately after the dropout\nrecovery than immediately before the dropout. In the bottom\ncurve, the letter indicates whether the number density was\nhigher (H), similar (S), or lower (L) immediately after the\ndropout recovery than immediately before the dropout.\nFigure 2. Looking down onto the ecliptic plane from\nabove, a CIR near Earth\u2019s orbit is sketched. The Sun is off\nthe bottom of the figure. The CIR is shaded in tan, and the\nEarth\u2019s track through the CIR is depicted as the green\ndashed line. In the reference frame of this sketch, the Earth\nmoves downward with time. The solar wind flow direction\nis shown with red arrows. At first, the Earth is in the slow\nwind ahead of the CIR. As the Earth enters the CIR, it enters\ninto compressed slow wind with a flow deflection to the\nleft. When the Earth crosses the stream interface (dark red),\nit exits the compressed slow wind and enters the\ncompressed fast wind and the flow deflection switches\nfrom left to right. When the Earth exits the CIR, it exits into\nfast wind with no flow deflection. Typically, ahead of the\nstream interface, there is a magnetic-field sector reversal\n(light-blue dashed curve) where the field switches from\ninward to outward or from outward to inward. In dark blue,\nthe positions of the Earth on its track where the relativistic-\nelectron dropout and recovery from dropout occur are\nindicated.

In section 2\nthe data sets used for the study and the superposed epoch\nmethods used are described. In section 3 the superposed\nepoch view of the solar wind and the magnetosphere during\nhigh-speed-stream-driven storms is presented. In section 4\nsuperposed epoch analysis of the solar wind and magneto-\nsphere triggered on the onsets of relativistic-electron drop-\nouts and on the recoveries of relativistic-electron dropouts\nare presented. In section 5 the implications of the findings\nof the superposed epoch studies are discussed. In section 6\nthe findings are summarized and needed new research is\noutlined.\n2. Data Sets and Event Selection for the\nAuperposed Epoch Analysis\n[9] Relativistic-electron dropouts and recoveries are spot-\nted and measured using the data set from the multispacecraft\nSynchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer (SOPA) [Belian et al.,\n1992] in circular geosynchronous orbits (6.6 RE) at the\ngeographic equator. SOPA measures spin-averaged differen-\ntial fluxes of electrons and of ions from 50 keV to 1.5 MeV\nevery 10 seconds. The SOPA electron-flux measurements\nused here were provided by R. Friedel (private communi-\ncation, 2007). For each year of data, the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV flux\nmeasurements on each of 7 spacecraft in operation were\nnormalized so that all spacecraft had the same yearly\naveraged logarithm of the flux in the dawn sector. For\nsome analysis, the SOPA fluxes on the individual spacecraft\nare used. Additionally, half-hour running averages of the\nmeasurements on each satellite were used to construct a\nmultispacecraft logarithmic average (sum of log-fluxes\ndivided by number satellites) of all the available fluxes at\nany time. The multispacecraft average flux was cleaned by\nremoving times of known solar-energetic-particle events.\n[10] The ion and electron plasma sheets and the plasma-\nsphere and plasmaspheric drainage plumes in the dipolar\nmagnetosphere are analyzed using the multispacecraft\nMagnetospheric Plasma Analyzer (MPA) data set [Bame\net al., 1993] in circular geosynchronous orbits (6.6 RE) at\nthe geographic equator. The MPA instruments measure\nthree-dimensional ion and electron distribution functions\nevery 86 seconds over the energy range 1 eV to 40 keV.\nEach distribution function is acquired in 10 seconds. MPA\nmeasurements from 7 spacecraft are used in the present\nanalysis.\n[11] The state of magnetospheric activity is measured\nwith the use of the Kp and Dst indices. The Kp index is\nconverted into a real number.\n[12] The 1-minute OMNI database [King and Papitashvili,\n2005] is used to obtain the properties of the solar wind plasma\nand the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) at the Earth.\n[13] The collection of high-speed-stream-driven storms\nused for the present study is the set of 124 recurring storms\nused for the superposed epoch studies of Denton and\nBorovsky [2008a, 2008b]. The storms are from the years\n1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006.\nRealizing that high-speed-stream-driven storms are ineffi-\ncient at producing Dst perturbations [Borovsky and Denton,\n2006], these 124 high-speed-stream-driven storms were\nchosen according to magnetospheric convection, ignoring\nthe Dst perturbations during the event selection. (This is in\ncontrast to other superposed epoch studies [e.g., Miyoshi\nand Kataoka, 2005; Denton et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006;\nYermolaev et al., 2007; Longden et al., 2008] which selected\nhigh-speed-stream-driven storms according to their Dst\nperturbations and focused the analysis on timing with\nrespect to the Dst perturbations.) The 124 recurring storms\nwere found by using the McPherron list of solar wind\nstream interfaces [R. McPherron, private communication,\n2007; McPherron and Weygand, 2006] and then examining\nTable 1.

Only storms that are preceded by and\/\nor followed by another storm 27 days earlier or later are\naccepted into the collection. Then, for each storm in the\ncollection, the onset time of convection (storm onset) is\ndetermined from a drop in MBI (midnight boundary index).\nMBI is an index created from locations of the low-latitude\nedge of the diffuse auroral precipitation as determined by\nDMSP-satellite overflights, mathematically shifted to local\nmidnight [Gussenhoven et al., 1983]. MBI is a proxy for the\nposition of the inner edge of the electron plasma sheet\n[Elphic et al., 1999], which makes it an excellent indicator\nof magnetospheric convection, as is Kp [Thomsen, 2004],\nbut MBI has higher time resolution than the 3-hour Kp\nindex. The storm onset times were determined to about 30-\nminute accuracy.\n[14] Subsets of events were collected based on properties\nof dropouts during the 124 storms. In particular a set of\n33 events with strong onsets of the relativistic-electron drop-\nout was selected, a set of 14 events that had strong relativistic-\nelectron recoveries was selected, and a set of 10 events in\nwhich no dropouts nor recoveries occurred was selected.\n[15] For the superposed epoch analysis of the data sets,\nthree types of triggers (zero epochs) will be used: (1) triggering\non storm onset as determined by increases in MBI (onsets\nof convection), (2) triggering on relativistic-electron-\ndropout onsets as seen in the multisatellite average of the\n1.1\u20131.5 MeVelectron flux, and (3) triggering on relativistic-\nelectron recoveries as seen in the multisatellite average of\nthe 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron flux.\n3. Superposed Epoch View of High-Speed-\nStream-Driven Storms\n[16] Figures 3 and 4 present an overview of high-speed-\nstream-driven storms. The various panels contain data\nsuperposed and averaged from 124 high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms with the zero epoch (trigger) chosen to be\nthe onset of storm levels of convection in the magneto-\nsphere. The onset of storm levels of convection is taken to\nbe when the Kp index reaches 4.3, but determined with the\nhigher-resolution MBI. To do this a linear fit of MBI as a\nfunction of Kp is made for the 21 years 1983\u20132003, which\nyields MBI = 65.27 \u0002 1.07Kp. According to the fit function,\nKp increasing to 4.3 is equivalent to MBI decreasing to\n60.68. The storm onset is then taken to be the first time at\nwhich MBI is lower than 60.68. In each panel of Figures 3\nand 4 the zero epoch is indicated by a vertical dashed line.\n[17] In Figures 3a to 3d, some solar wind parameters\nare plotted. Figure 3a shows the superposed average of the\nsolar wind speed. As can be seen, prior to the storm the solar\nwind speed is low (\u0001400 km\/sec on average) and the storm\nonset occurs as the solar wind speed is ramping up. The\nFigure 3. For 124 high-speed-stream-driven storms, super-\npositions of several measurements are plotted: in each figure,\nthe black curve is the mean and the red curves are the upper\nand lower quartiles. From top to bottom, the eight panels\ncontain the solar wind speed, the solar wind azimuthal (east-\nwest or ecliptic) flow velocity, the solar wind number density,\nthe z-component (GSM) of the solar wind magnetic field, the\nKp index, the midnight boundary index, the Dst index, and\nthe multisatellite average of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeVelectron flux at\ngeosynchronous orbit. The trigger for the data superposition\n(epoch = 0) is the onset of storm levels of convection in the\nmagnetosphere.\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n4 of 27\nA02201\nFigure 4.

Figure 3b contains a plot of the\nsuperposed average of the GSE y-component (ecliptic\ncomponent) of the solar wind velocity. Note the character-\nistic westward-then-eastward deflection of the solar wind\nthat is the signature of the corotating interaction region\n(CIR) between the slow wind and the fast wind [Siscoe et\nal., 1969]. The point where the vy flow reverses from\nwestward to eastward through zero is the stream interface\n[e.g., Burlaga, 1974]. Note in this superposed average that\nthe storm onset (dashed line) occurs about 3 hours prior to\nthe passage of the stream interface (see also Denton and\nBorovsky [2008b]). In Figure 3c, the superposed average of\nthe solar wind number density is plotted. The solar wind is\ncompressed in the CIR by the dynamic-pressure difference\nof the fast wind overtaking the slow wind and so the density\nis increased [Hundhausen, 1973; Richter and Luttrell,\n1986]. Prior to the passage of the stream interface the high\ndensity is compressed slow wind and any high density after\nthe interface is compressed fast wind.\n[18] In Figure 3d, the superposed average of the z-\ncomponent (GSM coordinates) of the solar wind magnetic\nfield Bz is plotted. Prior to the storm onset there is an\ninterval of northward Bz that ends a few hours before storm\nonset and at storm onset there is a distinctly southward\ninterval. The reversal from north to south (GSM) prior to the\nstorm onset is the sector reversal of the IMF that typically\noccurs prior to the stream interface [Gosling et al., 1978;\nNeugebauer et al., 2004]. High-speed-stream-driven storms\nare owed to a Russell-McPherron effect of a Parker-spiral-\norientation of the magnetic field seen in GSM coordinates:\nsouthward Bz after the sector reversal creates the storm\n[Crooker and Cliver, 1994; McPherron and Weygand,\n2006] and northward Bz prior to the sector reversal creates\na \u2018\u2018calm before the storm\u2019\u2019 [Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006].\n[19] In Figures 3e and 3f, two geomagnetic indices are\nplotted. In Figure 3e, the superposed average of the Kp\nindex is plotted. As can be seen, Kp is elevated after the\nstorm onset and Kp is low prior to the storm onset. Kp is a\nmeasure of the strength of convection in the magnetosphere\n[Thomsen, 2004], which is a measure of the strength of\nthe solar wind driving of the magnetosphere. In Figure 3f,\nthe superposed average of the Dst index is plotted. Prior to\nthe high-speed-stream-driven storm there is an interval in\nwhich Dst is positive indicating that the weakly driven\nmagnetosphere is compressed [Borovsky et al., 1998a]. At\nstorm onset Dst reverses to negative indicating the magne-\ntospheric convection is increasing the pressure of magneto-\nspheric plasmas to produce a diamagnetic effect [Sckopke,\n1966]. Note two things about the Dst signature of the storms.\nFirst, note that the negative Dst signature is modest; unlike\nCME-driven storms, high-speed-stream-driven storms typi-\ncally do not produce strong Dst perturbations [Yermolaev\nand Yermolaev, 2002; Denton et al., 2006; Borovsky and\nDenton, 2006]. Second, note that the negative-Dst pertur-\nbation is sustained for days during the storm. Unlike a true\nrecovery of Dst which is caused by convection shutting\ndown and the ring-current plasma decaying [e.g., Liemohn\net al., 1999; Kozyra and Liemohn, 2003], Dst in high-speed-\nstream-driven storms is, for days, maintained in a sustained\nequilibrium between driving and loss [cf. Turner et al.,\n2006].\n[20] In the bottom panel of Figure 3h, the superposed\naverage from the 124 storms of the multisatellite average of\nthe logarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron flux at geosyn-\nchronous orbit is plotted. Note that the flux drops just after\nstorm onset, goes through a recovery at about 1 day after\nstorm onset, and then grows in magnitude slowly over a\nseveral-day interval during the storm. In individual storms\nthe dropout onset and the recovery are much more rapid\nthan they are in this superposed average; in this plot they are\nsmoothed owing to variations in the timing of the dropout\nonset and the dropout recovery relative to the storm onset,\nwhich is the trigger for the superposition. Note in Figure 3h\nthe slow decay of the relativistic-electron flux prior to the\nonset of the storm: this decay is owed to pitch-angle\nscattering by plasma waves in the quiet magnetosphere\nprior to the storm [cf. Meredith et al., 2006]. On days when\na built-up outer plasmasphere is present this decay is more\nrapid [Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006].\n[21] In the seven panels of Figure 4 the plasmas and the\nrelativistic-electron flux around geosynchronous orbit are\nexamined for the 124 storms as functions of local time and\nstorm epoch. The zero epoch is the onset of storm convec-\ntion. In Figure 4a, the hot-ion (0.1\u201345 keV) density\nmeasured around geosynchronous orbit by MPA is dis-\nplayed. Prior to the storm the densities are at typical levels\n(densities of 1 cm\u00023 or less on the nightside and densities of\n0.5 cm\u00023 or less on the dayside [e.g., Thomsen et al., 1996;\nMaurice et al., 1998; Korth et al., 1999]) and about a day or\nso after storm onset the densities are again at typical levels.\nHowever, during the first day after storm onset the\nsuperposed average density is anomalously high. This is\nthe so-called \u2018\u2018superdense plasma sheet\u2019\u2019 (where \u2018\u2018super-\ndense\u2019\u2019 was defined to mean \u2018\u2018of anomalously high density\u2019\u2019\n[Borovsky et al., 1997; Denton and Borovsky, 2008b]). The\nsuperdense plasma sheet originates from extra-high-density\nsolar wind plasma (see Figure 3c) which enters the magne-\ntosphere with a several-hour time lag [Borovsky et al.,\n1998b], during high-speed-stream-driven storms in particu-\nlar [Denton and Borovsky, 2008b]. In Figure 4e, the super-\nposed average temperature of the ions measured around\ngeosynchronous orbit by MPA is displayed. Prior to storm\nonset the ion temperatures are typical: about 7 keV [Thom-\nsen et al., 1996; Korth et al., 1999; Denton et al., 2005,\n2006]. However, the ion temperature is anomalously hot\nbeginning at about storm onset and the temperature remains\nanomalously hot for the several-day duration of the storm.\nThis is the so-called \u2018\u2018extra-hot phase\u2019\u2019 of the plasma sheet\n[Denton and Borovsky, 2008b] (where \u2018\u2018extra-hot\u2019\u2019 was\ndefined to mean \u2018\u2018anomalously hot\u2019\u2019). The extra-hot plasma\nsheet is a result of the high speed of the solar wind\n[Borovsky et al., 1998b; Denton and Borovsky, 2008b].\nNote that the superdense plasma sheet seen in Figure 4a is\nhot (as in the study by Borovsky et al. [1997]) and should\nnot be confused with the \u2018\u2018cool dense plasma sheet\u2019\u2019 of the\nouter magnetosphere [Fujimoto et al., 2000, 2002, 2005;\nNishino et al., 2002; Phan et al., 2000] that sometimes\nbriefly appears at geosynchronous orbit during the early\nphases of storms [e.g., Thomsen et al., 2003; Borovsky and\nSteinberg, 2006; Lavraud et al., 2005, 2006].\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n6 of 27\nA02201\n[22] High-density magnetospheric plasma is important for\nthe production of a robust ring current and a negative Dst\nperturbation [e.g., Borovsky et al., 1997; Kozyra et al.,\n1998; Thomsen et al., 1998a; Ebihara et al., 2005]. Note\nthat the fact the superdense plasma sheet is so hot probably\ncontributes to the fact that high-speed-stream-driven storms\ndo not produce large Dst perturbations [Borovsky and\nDenton, 2006]: magnetospheric convection does not lead\nto as much plasma compression when the plasma is hot\n[e.g., Ebihara and Ejiri, 2000; Kozyra and Liemohn, 2003;\nLavraud et al., 2006; Lavraud and Jordanova, 2007].\n[23] The hot-electron (0.03\u201345 keV) behavior around\ngeosynchronous orbit as measured by MPA is displayed\nin Figures 4b and 4f. Figures 4b and 4f show a behavior that\nis very similar to that of the hot ions in the top row. The hot-\nelectron density is normal before the storm onset, is super-\ndense for about a day after storm onset, and is normal after\nabout a day after the onset, and the temperature is normal\nbefore the storm onset and is in a extra-hot phase beginning\nat the onset of the storm and lasting for days as the storm\nlasts. Note that this extra-hot electron plasma sheet gives\nrise to high levels of spacecraft charging during high-speed-\nstream-driven storms [Borovsky et al., 1998a; Denton et al.,\n2006; Borovsky and Denton, 2006]. Note also in Figure 4b\nthat the density of hot electrons on the dayside is much less\nthen the density on the nightside. This is because the\nplasma-sheet electrons suffer substantial loss to the atmo-\nspheric loss cone as they are transported from the nightside\naround to the dayside [Thomsen et al., 1998b; Longden et\nal., 2008].\n[24] The cold-plasma (1\u2013100 eV) (plasmasphere and\nplasmaspheric-drainage-plume) behavior around geosyn-\nchronous orbit measured by MPA is displayed in Figures 4c\nand 4g. In Figure 4c, the superposed average of the cold-ion\nnumber density is plotted and in the right column the\nfraction of time that the cold-ion density is observed to be\nabove 10 cm\u00023 is plotted. As can be seen in Figure 4g,\nprior to storm onset there is a probability of seeing plasma-\nspheric plasma at all local times; during the storm the\nplasmaspheric material is only found in the post-noon sector\nin the form of a drainage plume [e.g., Chappell, 1974; Chen\nand Grebowsky, 1974; Spiro et al., 1981; Elphic et al.,\n1996]. Prior to the storm the plasmasphere proper is seen at\ngeosynchronous orbit: if geomagnetic activity is very low\nthen the plasmasphere can be seen at all local times [cf.\nSojka and Wrenn, 1985; Su et al., 2001] and if geomagnetic\nactivity is modest then the plasmasphere is only encoun-\ntered at the \u2018\u2018dusk bulge\u2019\u2019 [cf. Chappell et al., 1970; Higel\nand Lei, 1984; Carpenter et al., 1993]. During a high-speed-\nstream-driven storm, there is essentially always a plasma-\nspheric drainage plume crossing geosynchronous orbit in\nthe post-noon sector [Borovsky and Denton, 2008] early in\nthe storm the plume is dense and broad (in local time) and\nlater in the storm it is less dense and narrower. Hence, in the\nsuperposed epoch average (third row) the probability of\nseeing plume material in the post-noon sector is high and\nthe average density there is high and later in the storm the\nprobability of being in plume plasma is lower and the\naverage density is lower. Note that whenever drainage-\nplume plasma is encountered, it is very lumpy with strong\ngradients in the plasma density [Borovsky and Denton,\n2008].\n[25] In Figure 4d, the logarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV\nelectron flux around geosynchronous orbit measured by\nSOPA is displayed. Prior to the storm onset, the level of\nflux is steady or slowly declining [cf. Meredith et al., 2006;\nBorovsky and Steinberg, 2006]. At storm onset the flux\ndrops rapidly (see also Figure 3h, which is the multisatellite\naverage of the logarithm of the flux). After about a day the\nflux recovers. Note the flux growing in intensity in the days\nfollowing the dropout recovery.\n[26] From this examination of Figures 3 and 4, it is found\nthat the relativistic-electron dropouts are temporally associ-\nated with (1) magnetospheric convection (as measured by\nKp) reaching high levels, (2) the appearance of the super-\ndense extra-hot ion plasma sheet (which is in turn associated\nwith the high-density solar wind with a few-hour time lag\n[Denton and Borovsky, 2008b]), (3) the appearance of the\nsuperdense extra-hot electron plasma sheet (which is also\nassociated with the high-density solar wind with a few-hour\ntime lag [Denton and Borovsky, 2008b]), (4) the onset of a\nplasmaspheric drainage plume, and (5) the storm time\nincrease in the magnitude of Dst.\n[27] Using three subsets of events and triggering the\nsuperposed epoch averages on the dropout onsets and on\nthe dropout recoveries, these temporal associations will be\nexplored in section 4. Also, by triggering on the onsets and\nrecoveries, the relativistic-electron dropouts can be better\nplaced in the timeline of the geomagnetic storm and of the\nchanging solar wind plasma and magnetic field of the CIR.\n4. Superposed Epoch Study of Special Events\n[28] From the 124 high-speed-stream-driven storms\nutilized in section 3, three subsets of events are selected\nfor closer study in the following three subsections. The first\nis a collection of 33 storms that have very rapid onsets of the\nrelativistic-electron dropouts. The second is a collection of\n14 storms that have very rapid recoveries of the relativistic-\nelectron flux. The third is a collection of 10 storms that have\nneither dropout nor recovery, i.e. the relativistic-electron\nfluxes were relatively unaffected during the storms. With\nthe first collection in section 4.1, we will trigger the\nsuperposed averages on the dropout onsets to see what the\ndropouts are associated with. The \u2018\u2018onset of dropout\u2019\u2019 will\nbe taken to be the steepest part of the drop in the logarithm\nof the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron flux. With the second collec-\ntion in section 4.2 we will trigger the superposed averages\non the recoveries to see what the recoveries are associated\nwith. The \u2018\u2018onset of recovery\u2019\u2019 will be taken to be the\nsteepest part of the rise in the logarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV\nelectron flux. The findings from these two examinations\nwill be contrasted in section 4.3 with the third set of events\nin which no dropouts nor recoveries happen. For this third\nset of events we cannot trigger on the dropout onset or\nrecovery (since there are none) so the superposed averages\nwill be triggered on the onset of storm convection, as were\nthe 124 storms of section 3.\n4.1. Triggering on Dropout Onsets\n[29] The superposed average of the data when using the\n33 events with sharp onsets of dropouts and triggering on\nthe onset are displayed in top columns of Figures 5 and 6\nand in left-hand columns of Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10. The\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n7 of 27\nA02201\nzero epoch (= onset of dropout = steepest part of the drop) is\ndenoted in each panel of those figures by a vertical dashed\nline.\n[30] The superposed average of the logarithm of the 1.1\u2013\n1.5 MeV electron flux measured by SOPA onboard the\nmultiple satellites around geosynchronous orbit is shown in\nFigure 5 (top), with the zero epoch being the steepest part of\nthe drop in the multisatellite average of the logarithm of the\n1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron flux. As can be seen in Figure 5, the\nFigure 5.

Owing to the systematic\ndiurnal trend in the fluxes, it is difficult to see if there is a\nlocal-time dependence of the timing of the onset of dropout\nin Figure 5.

The zero epoch (trigger) for\nthe superposition of data is the steepest part of the drop in\nthe logarithm of the flux. As can be seen, when superposing\non the onsets of the dropouts, the abruptness of the onsets is\nevident. In Figure 7a, the dropout recovery appears gradual\nowing to the mixed timings of the individual recoveries.\nWhen the recoveries are used as the trigger (see Figure 7h),\nthen the rapidity of the recoveries will be seen.\n[32] In Figures 7b to 7e, the superposed averages of some\nsolar wind parameters are plotted triggered on relativistic-\nelectron-dropout onsets. Figure 7b shows the solar wind\nspeed. As can be seen, the onset of the dropout (vertical\ndashed line) occurs while the solar wind speed is increasing.\nFigure 7c shows that the onset of dropout occurs in the CIR\nduring the westward flow deflection of the solar wind. In\nthe superposed average, the onset of dropout (steepest part\nof the drop) occurs about 6 hours prior to the passage of the\nstream interface (reversal of vy through zero). Analyzing the\n33 individual events that go into the superposed average,\nthe onset of dropout (steepest part of the drop) occurs\n4.6 \u00b1 5.7 hours prior to the passage of the stream interface\n(where A \u00b1 B is the mean value \u00b1 one standard deviation).\nThis means that the onset occurs during the passage of the\ncompressed slow wind in the CIR. This is noted in Table 1\nand is noted in the CIR sketch of Figure 2. Figure 7d shows\nthe superposed average of the solar wind density. Note the\npulse of high-density solar wind. Comparing this Figure 7d\nwith the Figure 7c, it is seen that most of the high-density\nsolar wind occurs prior to the passage of the stream interface\n(vy reversal through zero), meaning that most of the high-\ndensity solar wind is compressed slow wind. This is noted\nin Table 1. As can be seen in Figure 7d, the dropout onset\noccurs while the solar wind density is high. Note that the\nonset of dropout occurs about 6 to 8 hours after the solar\nwind density begins to rise. Figure 7e shows that the\nrelativistic-electron drop onset occurs during the passage\nof the pulse of strong \u0002Bz in the solar wind. In the\nsuperposed averages of Figure 7e, this dropout onset\n(steepest part of the drop) occurs about 9 hours after the\npassage of the sector reversal (where Bz crosses through\nzero to turn negative). Analyzing the individual events that\ngo into the superposed average, the onset of dropout occurs\n7.3 \u00b1 8.4 hours after to the passage of the sector reversal.\nThis is noted into Table 1 and is noted in the CIR sketch of\nFigure 2.\n[33] In Figures 7f and 7g, the superposed average of the\ngeomagnetic indices Kp and Dst are displayed, with the data\nsuperposition triggered on the relativistic-electron-dropout\nonset. As can be seen in Figure 7f, the onset of dropout\noccurs just about as the Kp index is reaching its maximum\nvalue; i.e. the dropout onset (steepest part of the drop)\noccurs when the magnetospheric convection is reaching its\nmaximum value. This is noted in Table 1. As can be seen in\nFigure 7g, the dropout onset occurs as the Dst index is\nmaking its rapid descent to negative values.\n[34] In the left-hand column of Figure 8, the density and\ntemperature of the hot ions (ion plasma sheet) and hot\nelectrons (electron plasma sheet and electron trough) around\ngeosynchronous orbit as measured by MPA are shown, with\nthe zero epoch (trigger) of the data superposition being the\nonset of the relativistic-electron dropout. As can be seen in\nFigures 8a and 8b, the onset of dropout is approximately\nsimultaneous with the appearance of the superdense ion\nplasma sheet at geosynchronous orbit and the appearance of\nthe superdense electron plasma sheet at geosynchronous\norbit. In addition, as can be seen in Figures 8c and 8d, the\nrelativistic-electron-dropout onset is approximately simulta-\nneous with the onset of the extra-hot phase of the ion\nplasma sheet at geosynchronous orbit and the extra-hot\nphase of the electron plasma sheet at geosynchronous orbit.\nThese facts are noted in Table 1. Depending on local time,\nthe extra-hot phase usually commences about 3 hours after\nthe superdense phase at geosynchronous orbit for high-\nspeed-stream-driven storms [Denton and Borovsky,\n2008b]. The timing of the onsets of relativistic-electron\ndropouts relative to the superdense and extra-hot plasma-\nsheet onsets will be explored in Figure 10 later in this\nsubsection.\n[35] In Figure 9 (left), some of the properties of the cold-\nplasma measured around geosynchronous orbit by MPA are\nshown, with the zero epoch (trigger) of the data superposi-\ntion being the onset of the relativistic-electron dropout.\nFigures 9a and 9e show the superposed average cold-plasma\ndensity. At the time of onset of the dropout, the dusk bulge\nof the plasmasphere is undergoing a narrowing in local-time\nextent into the plasmaspheric drainage plume in the post-\nnoon sector. This same phenomena is seen again in Figure 9b,\nwhere the fraction of time that the cold-plasma density is\nobserved to be above 10 cm\u00023 is shown: the onset of the\nrelativistic-electron-dropout occurs as the dusk bulge is tran-\nsitioning into the drainage plume. This is noted in Table 1.\nIn Figure 9c, the superposed average of the flow speed of\nthe cold-plasma measured at geosynchronous orbit is\nshown. At about the time of onset of the dropout, the\nplasmaspheric material begins to flow (owing to magneto-\nFigure 10. Several parameters at geosynchronous orbit are plotted (left) for 33 events with clear onsets of dropouts\n(triggered on the onset) and (right) for 14 events with clear recoveries (triggered on the recovery). The parameters are all\naveraged over the full orbit, except the cold-ion flow velocities, which are averaged only over the 14\u201318 LT region. (a, j) Hot-\nion (0.1\u201345 keV) density at geosynchronous orbit. (b, k) Hot-ion temperature at geosynchronous orbit. (c, l) Hot-ion pressure\nat geosynchronous orbit. (d, m) Hot-electron (0.03\u201345 keV) density at geosynchronous orbit. (e, n) Hot-electron temperature.\n(f, o) Hot-electron pressure. (g, p) Cold-ion (1\u2013100 eV) density. (h, q) Cold-ion flow speed (only used when the density is\ngreater than 10 cm\u00023). (i, r) Fraction of time when the cold-ion density is greater than 10 cm\u00023 and the hot-ion pressure is\ngreater then 1 nPa.\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n14 of 27\nA02201\nspheric convection). Note that when the plasmaspheric\nmaterial flows, it becomes lumpy [Borovsky and Denton,\n2008]. In Figures 9d and 9h, the superposed average of the\nproduct of the hot-ion pressure (in units of nPa) and the\ncold-ion density (in units of cm\u00023) is plotted. This plot\nshows the times and regions where there is strong potential\nfor the growth of electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC)\nwaves: sufficient free energy in the hot ions and sufficient\ncold plasma [Cornwall et al., 1970; Fraser and Nguyen,\n2001]. Note that the color scale is logarithmic. As can be\nseen, this product increases noticeably at the time of onset\nof the relativistic-electron dropout.\n[36] In the left-hand column of Figure 10 we will look for\nindications of what causes the relativistic-electron dropouts.\nMost quantities plotted in Figure 10 are \u2018\u2018orbit averaged\u2019\u2019,\nthat is they are averaged over all local times. To guide the\neye, in each panel of the left-hand column the multisatellite\naverage of the logarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron flux\ntriggered on the onset of dropout is drawn in gray, and\nthe trigger is drawn as the vertical dashed line. In\nFigures 10a-10c and 10j-10l, the orbit-averaged density,\ntemperature, and pressure of the ion plasma sheet is plotted.\nAs can be seen, the commencement of the superdense and\nextra-hot ion plasma sheet is simultaneous with the onset\nof relativistic-electron dropout. In Figures 10d-10f and\n10m-10o, the orbit-averaged density, temperature, and pres-\nsure of the hot electrons is plotted. Likewise, the onset of\nthe relativistic-electron dropout is simultaneous with the\ncommencement of the superdense and extra-hot electron\nplasma sheet. In Figures 10g-10h and 10p-10q, the orbit-\naveraged cold-ion density and the cold-ion flow velocity\naveraged over the 14\u201318 LT regime are plotted. The onset\nof relativistic-electron dropout is simultaneous with the\nformation of plasmaspheric drainage plumes, signified by\na dropping of the orbit-averaged cold-ion density and a\ncommencement of the cold-ion flow velocity. Finally,\nFigures 10i and 10r, the fraction of time over the geosyn-\nchronous orbit that both the cold-ion density is greater\nthen 10 cm\u00023 AND the hot-ion pressure is greater then\n1 nPa is plotted. As can be seen, simultaneous with the\nonset of the relativistic-electron dropout the fraction of time\nhigh-pressure ions overlap with high-density cold plasma\nincreases.\n[37] In section 6.1 the findings of the examination of the\nsolar wind and the magnetosphere triggered on relativistic-\nelectron-dropout onsets will be summarized. Many phenom-\nena are approximately simultaneous with the onset of drop-\nouts: the onset of the superdense ion and electron plasma\nsheet, the onset of the extra-hot ion and electrons plasma\nsheet, and the onset of plasmaspheric drainage plumes. In\nsection 4.2 these findings will be compared with what is\nfound when the zero epoch is set on the recovery from\ndropout. That study will hone in on the combination of the\nsuperdense ion plasma sheet and the plasmaspheric drainage\nplumes.\n4.2. Triggering on Dropout Recoveries\n[38] The superposed average of the data when using the\n14 events with sharp recoveries of dropouts and triggering\non the steepest part of the recovery in the multisatellite\naverage of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron flux are displayed in\nFigures 6 (bottom) and 10i-10r and in the right-hand columns\nof Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10. The zero epoch (= recovery from\ndropout) is denoted in each panel of those figures by a vertical\ndashed line.\n[39] The superposed average of the logarithm of the 1.1\u2013\n1.5 MeV electron flux measured by the multiple satellites\naround geosynchronous orbit is shown in Figure 5 (bottom),\nwith the zero epoch being the steepest part of the rise in the\nmultisatellite average of the logarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV\nelectron flux. Owing to the systematic diurnal trend in the\nfluxes, it is difficult to see if there is a local-time depen-\ndence of the timing of the relativistic-electron flux recovery\nas plotted in Figure 5. In Figure 6 (bottom), the logarithm of\nthe 1.1\u20131.5 MeVelectron fluxes is averaged over 5 hours of\nlocal time centered at midnight (0 LT, red), dawn (6 LT,\ngreen), noon (12 LT, blue), and dusk (18 LT, purple) and\nplotted as functions of time from trigger. The curves from\nthe four local-time regions were fit with hyperbolic-tangents\nto determine the temporal widths of the recoveries in flux\nand the relative timing of the recoveries. It is found that the\nwidths of the drops in the four regions vary from 8.3 hr to\n12.3 hr. The temporal centers of the recoveries are within\n0.75 hours of each other, with the recovery occurring first\nat midnight, then dusk, then noon, and then dawn. Note,\nthe relative timings determined may not be statistically\nsignificant.\n[40] In Figure 7h, the superposed average of the loga-\nrithm of the multisatellite averaged 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron\nflux at geosynchronous orbit is plotted. The zero epoch\n(trigger) for the superposition of data is the steepest part of\nthe recovery in the logarithm of the flux. As can be seen,\nwhen superposing on the recoveries of the dropouts, the\nabruptness of the recovery is evident. In Figure 7h, the\ndropout onset appears gradual owing to the mixed timings\nof the individual onsets.\n[41] In Figures 7i-7l, some solar wind parameters are\nplotted for triggering on relativistic-electron recoveries.\nFigure 7i shows the solar wind speed. As can be seen, the\nrecovery from dropout (vertical dashed line) occurs near the\nend of the interval wherein the solar wind speed is increas-\ning. Figure 7j shows that the recovery occurs in the CIR\nduring the eastward flow deflection of the solar wind. In the\nsuperposed average of Figure 7, the recovery (steepest part\nof the rise) occurs about 10 to 11 hours after the passage of\nthe stream interface (reversal of vy of the solar wind through\nzero). Analysis of the individual events that go into the\nsuperposed average finds that the recovery occurs 10.5 \u00b1\n4.8 hours after the passage of the stream interface. This\nmeans that the onset occurs during the passage of the\ncompressed fast wind in the CIR. This is noted in Table 1\nand is noted in the CIR sketch of Figure 2. Figure 7k\nindicates that the recovery occurs after the solar wind\ndensity pulse passes. Figure 7l shows that the relativistic-\nelectron recovery from dropout occurs during the fluctuating\nmagnetic field interval of the high-speed stream.\n[42] In Figures 7l and 7m, the superposed average of the\ngeomagnetic indices Kp and Dst are displayed, with the data\nsuperposition triggered on the relativistic-electron recovery.\nAs can be seen in Figure 7m, the relativistic-electron\nrecovery occurs during the sustained high Kp of the high-\nspeed stream. As can be seen in Figure 7n, the relativistic-\nelectron recovery occurs during the interval when Dst is\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n15 of 27\nA02201\nbalanced between driving and loss. Note that there is no Dst\nsignature corresponding to the relativistic-electron recovery.\n[43] In the right-hand column of Figure 8 the density and\ntemperature of the hot ions (ion plasma sheet) and hot\nelectrons (electron plasma sheet and electron trough) around\ngeosynchronous orbit as measured by MPA are shown, with\nthe zero epoch (trigger) of the data superposition being the\nrelativistic-electron recovery. As can be seen in the first and\nsecond plots of the right column, the relativistic-electron\nrecovery is approximately simultaneous with the disappear-\nance of the superdense ion plasma sheet and the disappear-\nance of the superdense electron plasma sheet. This is noted\nin Table 1. As can be seen in Figures 8g and 8h, the extra-\nhot phase of the ion plasma sheet and the extra-hot phase of\nthe electron plasma sheet both persist beyond the time of\nrecovery of the relativistic electrons. The timing of the\nrelativistic-electron recovery relative to the termination of\nthe superdense plasma sheet will be explored further in\nFigure 10.\n[44] In the right-hand column of Figure 9, some of the\nproperties of the cold-plasma measured around geosynchro-\nnous orbit by MPA are shown, with the zero epoch (trigger)\nof the data superposition being the relativistic-electron\nrecovery. Figure 9e shows the superposed average of the\ncold-plasma density. At the time of relativistic-electron\nrecovery, the drainage plume appears to weaken substan-\ntially in terms of plasma number density. This same phe-\nnomena is seen again in Figure 9f, where the fraction of\ntime that the cold-plasma density is observed to be above\n10 cm\u00023 is shown. Looking statistically at the properties of\nplasmaspheric drainage plumes during high-speed-stream-\ndriven storms (without selection as to whether or not there\nwas a relativistic-electron dropout or recovery), Borovsky\nand Denton [2008] found that the average number density\nnave of plume plasma decays with time as nave \/ exp(\u0002t\/78\nhours). The local-time widths W of the plumes were also\nfound to decrease with time t from storm onset. If the\nproduct Wnave in that plume data set is fit, then a temporal\ndecay of the form exp(\u0002t\/44 hours) is obtained. The plume\nproperties in Figure 9 appear to decay faster than a 44-hr e-\nfolding time. In Figure 9g, the superposed average of the\nflow speed of the cold-plasma measured at geosynchronous\norbit is shown. No clear signature in the cold-plasma flow\nproperties is seen in correlation with the time of relativistic-\nelectron dropout. In Figure 9h, the superposed average of\nthe product of the hot-ion pressure (in units of nPa) and the\ncold-ion density (in units of cm\u00023) is plotted. Note that the\ncolor scale is logarithmic. This plot shows the regions where\nthere is strong potential for the growth of electromagnetic\nion-cyclotron (EMIC) waves: sufficient free energy in the\nhot ions and sufficient cold plasma. As can be seen, this\nproduct drops noticeably at the time of relativistic-electron\nrecovery.\n[45] In the right-hand column of Figure 10 we will look\nfor indications of what causes the recovery from the\nrelativistic-electron dropouts. To guide the eye, in each\npanel of the right-hand column the multisatellite average\nof the logarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron flux triggered\non the dropout recovery is drawn in gray, and the trigger is\ndrawn as the vertical dashed line. In Figures 10j to 10l, the\norbit-averaged density, temperature, and pressure of the ion\nplasma sheet is plotted. As can be seen in Figures 10j to 10l,\nthe recovery of the relativistic-electron flux is not associated\nwith the hot-ion temperature and the recovery is weakly\nassociated with the hot-ion density and pressure. In\nFigures 10m to 10o, the orbit-averaged density, temperature,\nand pressure of the hot electrons is plotted. Likewise, the\nrecovery of the relativistic-electron flux is not associated\nwith the hot-electron temperature and the recovery is\nweakly associated with the hot-electron density and pres-\nsure. In Figures 10p and 10q, the orbit-averaged cold-ion\ndensity and the cold-ion flow velocity averaged over the\n14\u201318 LT regime are plotted. The recovery from relativis-\ntic-electron dropout is associated with the decay of the orbit-\naveraged cold-ion density but is not associated with the\ncold-ion velocity. The decay of the orbit-averaged density is\na indication that the plasmaspheric drainage plumes are\ngetting less dense and narrower with age [cf. Borovsky and\nDenton, 2008]. Finally, in Figure 10r, the fraction of time\nover the geosynchronous orbit that both the cold-ion density\nis greater then 10 cm\u00023 and the hot-ion pressure is greater\nthen 1 nPa is plotted. As can be seen, simultaneous with the\nrecovery from the relativistic-electron dropout the fraction\nof time high-pressure ions overlap with high-density cold\nplasma decreases.\n[46] The key finding of this subsection and the last\nappears to be the association of the relativistic-electron\ndropout with the combined superdense ion plasma sheet\nand the plasmaspheric drainage plume. In particular, drop-\nouts occur when the superdense ion plasma sheet spatially\noverlaps the drainage plume.\n4.3. Events Without Dropouts\n[47] To test some of the findings of the previous two\nsubsections, a set of 10 events is collected wherein no\nrelativistic-electron dropout nor recovery occur. Those\nevents are analyzed in Figures 11 and 12. Since there are\nneither onsets nor recoveries, the superposed epoch is\ntriggered on the onset of convection in the storm, as was\nthe triggering in Figures 3 and 4.\n[48] In Figure 11a, the superposed average of the loga-\nrithm of the multisatellite-averaged 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron\nflux is plotted. Note that no relativistic-electron dropout is\nseen. This is in contrast with Figure 3 (top) where the\ntriggering is the same but clear dropouts in the relativistic-\nelectron flux are seen in the superposed averages. In\nFigures 11b-11e, superposed averages of the solar wind\nparameters are plotted. As can be seen in Figures 11c and\n11d, the CIR signatures are weak: the magnitude of the east-\nwest shear flow is modest (Figure 11c) and the solar wind-\ndensity perturbation is very weak (Figure 11d). Figure 11e\nindicates that the Bz (GSM) signature is also modest.\n[49] In Figures 11f and 11g, the superposed averages of\nthe Kp and Dst indices are displayed. The superposed\naverage of Kp indicates a weak onset of convection, whilst\nthe Dst perturbation of the storm is also very weak.\n[50] In Figure 12 the superposed averages of the proper-\nties of the hot and cold plasmas around geosynchronous\norbit as measured by MPA are shown. Figures 12a and 12e\ncontain the density and temperature of the ion plasma sheet.\nAlthough the ion plasma sheet goes into a extra-hot phase at\nthe time of storm onset (Figure 12e), it does not go into a\nsuperdense phase (Figure 12a). Similarly for the superposed\naverages of the electron plasma sheet in the second row of\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n16 of 27\nA02201\nFigure 11: a extra-hot phase occurs associated with the\nonset of the storm but no superdense phase is seen. In the\nthird row of Figure 11 the superposed averages of the cold\nion density and occurrence probability are shown. In\nFigure 12c, the formation of a plasmaspheric drainage\nplume in the post-noon sector can be seen at storm onset,\nbut weak. The occurrence probability (fraction of time the\ncold-plasma density is above 10 cm\u00023) in Figure 12g shows\na similar behavior.\n[51] Figure 11g shows the logarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV\nelectron flux measured by SOPA on multiple satellites\naround geosynchronous orbit. No clear dropout is seen\nand no sharp recovery is seen. Note however that the\nrelativistic-electron fluxes do slowly increase as the storm\nprogresses (see also Figure 11a).\n[52] From this examination of events without dropouts, it\nis found that there is no high-density pulse in the solar wind\nand hence no superdense plasma sheet in the magneto-\nsphere. There are drainage plumes, but weak.\n5. Implications of the Findings\n[53] From the examination of the temporal association of\nthe solar wind and magnetosphere with the onset and\nrecovery of relativistic-electron dropouts in section 4, it\nappears that dropouts are caused by the combination of a\nsuperdense plasma sheet and a plasmaspheric drainage\nplume. The scenario envisioned is that these two phenom-\nena act in concert to produce EMIC waves which pitch-\nangle scatter the relativistic electrons into the atmospheric\nloss cone. About 6 hours of scattering is required to deplete\nthe 1.1\u20131.5 MeV relativistic-electron population at geosyn-\nchronous orbit and the population stays depleted for about\n6\u201320 hours.\n[54] The cause for the dropout being the overlap of the\nsuperdense plasma sheet and the plasmaspheric drainage\nplume is explored further in Figures 13 and 14. In\nFigures 13a to 13c, the fraction of time that the cold-ion\ndensity is greater then 10 cm\u00023 and simultaneously the hot-\nion pressure is greater then 1 nPa is plotted. In Figure 13a,\nthe trigger is on the onset of relativistic-electron dropout and\nin Figure 13b, the trigger is on the recovery. As can be seen,\nat about the time of trigger (Figure 13a) the fraction of time\nthat there is overlap between a superdense plasma sheet and\na drainage plume is significant, 50% or greater at the\nafternoon local-time regions where plumes are expected.\nIn addition, as can be seen, at about the time of recovery\n(Figure 13b) this high probability diminishes significantly.\nWhen there is no dropout nor recovery (Figure 13c), the\nprobability of an overlap of high-pressure plasma sheet with\ncold ions is lower. This can be seen in Figure 13d where the\nprobabilities of Figures 13a to 13c are averaged over local\ntime. An example of this is shown in Figure 14, where the\ninterplay of the plasmaspheric drainage plume (blue), the\nion plasma sheet (red), and the relativistic-electron dropout\n(green) as seen by the spacecraft 1989\u2013046 in geosynchro-\nnous orbit during the November 1993 National Space\nWeather Program Storm [Knipp et al., 1998] is shown.\n(See Borovsky et al. [1998a] for a fuller analysis of this\nevent.) The green curve (right axis) plots the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV\nelectron flux as measured by the SOPA instrument on board\nthe spacecraft 1989\u2013046 for 5.5 days in November 1993.\nFigure 11. For a set of 10 storms that had neither dropouts\nnor recovery, superpositions of several measurements are\nplotted. (a) Logarithm of the multisatellite average of the\n1.1\u20131.5MeVelectron flux at geosynchronous orbit. (b) Solar\nwind speed. (c) Solar wind azimuthal (east-west or ecliptic)\nflow velocity. (d) Solar wind number density. (e) z-Component\n(GSM) of the solar wind magnetic field. (f) Kp index. (g) Dst\nindex. The trigger for the data superposition is the onset of\nstorm levels of convection in the magnetosphere.\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n17 of 27\nA02201\nFigure 12. For 10 events without dropouts or recoveries, superpositions of several measurements are\nplotted. (a) Density and temperature of the hot ions (0.1\u201345 keV) around geosynchronous orbit. (b) Density\nand temperature of the hot electrons (0.03\u201345 keV) around geosynchronous orbit.

(d) Logarithm of the flux of 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electrons around geosynchronous\norbit.\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n18 of 27\nA02201\nThe relativistic-electron dropout (labeled) begins just before\nmidnight of 3\u20134 November and ends just after midday on\n4 November. During this dropout, the spacecraft 1989\u2013046\nmakes one crossing of the drainage plume in the afternoon\nsector. The cold-plasma number density as measured by the\nMPA detector on 1989\u2013046 is plotted in blue (left axis) and\nthis first plume crossing early on 4 November is labeled in\nFigure 14. The hot-ion pressure in the energy range 100 eV\nto 40 keV as measured by MPA onboard 1989\u2013046 is\nplotted in red (right axis). As can be seen, during this first\nplume crossing the pressure of the ion plasma sheet within\nthe plume was 2 nPa or higher. As noted in the study by\nBorovsky et al. [1998a], the plasma sheet was in a super-\ndense phase during this first plume crossing on 4 November.\nDuring this geomagnetic storm, the spacecraft 1989\u2013046\ncrossed through the drainage plume several more times,\nonce per day. The next four plume crossings are shown in\nblue and are labeled in Figure 14. The green curve demon-\nstrates that those subsequent plume crossings were after the\nrelativistic-electron dropout had recovered. As can be seen\nfrom the red curve, the pressure of the ion plasma sheet\ninside the plume was low on the crossings after the dropout\nhad recovered. The plume was still there, but the plasma\nsheet was not superdense.\n[55] The superdense ion plasma sheet is produced by the\nentry of the high-density solar wind of the CIR into the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere with about a 2- to 8-hour time lag\n[Denton and Borovsky, 2008b]. The high-density solar wind\nthat produces the superdense plasma sheet is mainly com-\npressed slow wind ahead of the CIR stream interface.\n[56] The plasmaspheric drainage plume is the result of\nstrong convection in the magnetosphere. The onset of\nconvection comes from the southward (GSM) IMF after\nthe passage of the IMF sector reversal, with the sector\nreversal typically passing the Earth prior to the passage of\nthe CIR stream interface. The GSM southward IMF comes\nabout from the Parker-spiral-like magnetic field of the\nCIR owing to a Russell-McPherron effect [Russell and\nMcPherron, 1973]. Because of this Russell-McPherron\neffect, there are more high-speed-stream-driven storms in\nthe Spring and Fall than there are in the Summer and Winter\n[cf. Crooker and Cliver, 1994; Mursula and Zieger, 1996;\nMcPherron and Weygand, 2006; Borovsky and Steinberg,\n2006]. Of the 124 storms studied in section 3, 56% occurred\nin Spring and Fall and 44% occurred in Summer and\nWinter, and of the 33 clean dropout events studied in section\n4, 58% occurred in Spring and Fall and 42% occurred in\nSummer and Winter.\n[57] As an aside, note that a complementary region of\noverlap between the superdense electron plasma sheet and\nhigh-density cold plasma is not expected. The electron\nplasma sheet tends not to overlap spatially with plasma-\nspheric material [Horwitz et al., 1986; Moldwin et al., 1995;\nDenton et al., 2005]. As a check on this, the product of the\nhot-electron pressure with the cold-ion density is calculated\nand found to be on average two orders of magnitude lower\nthan the product of the hot-ion pressure with the cold-ion\ndensity.\n[58] As stated above, it appears that relativistic-electron\ndropouts are caused by the combination of a superdense\nplasma sheet and a plasmaspheric drainage plume. It is well\nknown that EMIC waves grow best in locations where the\nFigure 13. The fraction of time that the hot-ion (0.1\u201345 keV)\npressure is greater than 1 nPa at the same time that the cold-\nion (1\u2013100 eV) density is greater than 10 cm\u00023 is compared\naround geosynchronous orbit. (a) Quantity is plotted\ntriggered on the onset of relativistic-electron dropout (for\n33 events with clear onsets). (b) Quantity is plotted triggered\non dropout recovery (for 14 events with clear recoveries).\n(c) Quantity is plotted triggered on storm-convection onset\nfor 10 events that have neither dropout nor recovery. (d) The\nprobabilities are averaged over local time.\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n19 of 27\nA02201\nhot ions of the magnetosphere drive the waves and the cold\nplasma of the magnetosphere reduces the instability thresh-\nold [e.g., Cornwall et al., 1970; Fraser and Nguyen, 2001;\nMeredith et al., 2003; Fuselier et al., 2004]. EMIC waves\nhave been theoretically expected to grow in drainage\nplumes [e.g., Kovalevskiy, 1980, 1981; Jordanova et al.,\n2006; Thorne et al., 2006] and there is indirect evidence for\nEMIC waves scattering particles from plume regions [e.g.,\nSpasojevic et al., 2004; Fraser et al., 2006; Yahnin and\nYahnina, 2007; Jordanova et al., 2007]. With the large\namount of free energy in the superdense, extra-hot ion\nplasma sheet, this makes the regions where the superdense\nion plasma sheet penetrates into the plasmaspheric drainage\nplumes very likely regions for EMIC-wave growth. EMIC\nwaves can be powerful sources of pitch-angle scattering of\nrelativistic electrons into the atmospheric loss cone [e.g.,\nThorne and Kennel, 1971; Horne and Thorne, 1998;\nSummers et al., 1998; Summers and Thorne, 2003;\nSandanger et al., 2007]. The high density of the drainage\nplume also lowers the resonance energy for interaction of\nthe EMIC waves with the relativistic electrons of the\nradiation belt [cf. Thorne and Kennel, 1971; Summers and\nThorne, 2003; Meredith et al., 2003]. This makes the\nregions where the superdense ion plasma sheet penetrates\ninto the plasmaspheric drainage plumes very likely regions\nfor relativistic-electron scattering. Note that plasmaspheric\ndrainage plumes extend across all L shells of the dayside\nmagnetosphere from the storm-time-contracted plasmapause\nall the way to the magnetopause [Elphic et al., 1996;\nBorovsky et al., 1997; Su et al., 2000; Goldstein et al.,\n2004]. Because of this extension, there is potentially a\nregion of favorable wave growth and favorable relativis-\ntic-electron scattering at all L shells.\n[59] We suggest that two other factors that may enhance\nthe favorability of those superdense-plasma-sheet\/drainage-\nplume overlap regions for strong EMIC growth: (1) the\nstrong density gradients in the lumpy drainage plumes\nincreases the ducting of EMIC waves and (2) \u2018\u2018energy-\npitch-angle dark lanes\u2019\u2019 in the dayside ion-plasma-sheet\ndistribution functions increase the free energy for wave\ngrowth. These two factors are discussed in the next two\nparagraphs.\n[60] Plasmaspheric drainage plumes are lumpy [Taylor et\nal., 1970; Spasojevic et al., 2003; Moldwin et al., 2004;\nGoldstein et al., 2004]. As soon as plasmaspheric plasma\nbegins to convect at the onset of a storm, the lumpiness of\nthe plasma is observed to increase greatly [Borovsky and\nDenton, 2008]. Using 10-second snapshots of the plasma\nnumber density made every 86 seconds, the fractional\nvariance dn\/n = 2(n2 \u0002 n1)\/(n1 + n2) of drainage-plume\nplasma density was analyzed by Borovsky and Denton\n[2008], where n1 and n2 are two sequential measurements\nof the density separated by 86 seconds. For 470 hours of\nmeasurements in drainage plumes, the mean value of dn\/n\nwas found to be 0.57. With cold-plasma convection veloc-\nities of\u000115 km\/sec, the 86-sec cadence of the measurements\nFigure 14. For a high-speed-stream-driven storm in November 1993, the cold-plasma (1\u2013100 eV)\ndensity (blue, left axis), the hot-ion (0.0\u201345 keV) pressure (red, right axis), and the logarithm of the 1.1\u2013\n1.5 MeV electron flux (green, right axis) are all plotted measured onboard the spacecraft 1989-046 in\ngeosynchronous orbit. The pressure of the ion plasmas sheet inside the plasmaspheric drainage plume can\nbe compared for a plume during the relativistic-electron dropout versus plumes after the recovery from\ndropout.\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n20 of 27\nA02201\ncorresponded to \u00011300 km of distance transverse to the\nmagnetic field, so the plumes are filled with strong density\ngradients with gradient scales on the order of 1000 km. It is\nwell known that ducting along field-aligned density struc-\ntures enhances the growth of EMIC waves [Thorne and\nHorne, 1997; Fraser and Nguyen, 2001; Khazanov et al.,\n2006] and the lumpiness of plumes should provide broad\nregions where the EMIC growth is enhanced: not just at the\nplume edges, but throughout the plume interiors.\n[61] The ion distribution functions in the dayside magne-\ntosphere are very structured. As the ions of the plasma sheet\nare transported from the nightside magnetosphere to the\ndayside, ions with different kinetic energies and different\npitch angles follow different trajectories around the dipole\n[e.g., Ejiri et al., 1980; Greenspan et al., 1985; Ebihara and\nEjiri, 2002]. Some ions pass around the dawn side of the\nEarth and some pass around the dusk side. The energy\/\npitch-angle ion distribution function observed at any loca-\ntion in the dayside magnetosphere is an assemblage of ions\nthat have come from the nightside along these various\npathways around the dipole. The various paths carry the\nions through different depths of the hydrogen geocorona\naround the Earth. The hydrogen geocorona acts to remove\nions by charge exchange. Passing to different depths in the\nFigure 15. As measured by the MPA instrument onboard the spacecraft 1994-084 in geosynchronous\norbit, several ion energy distribution functions are shown for the day of 10 November 2004. As the\nspacecraft crossed the dayside magnetosphere that day, the relativistic-electron fluxes were dropping out.\nFrom 13 to 18 LT, the spacecraft 1994-084 was in a plasmaspheric drainage plume. The distributions at\n14 LT, 16 LT, and 18 LT are for superdense plasma sheets within plasmaspheric drainage plumes with\nPi > 1 nPa and ncold > 10 cm\n\u00023.\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n21 of 27\nA02201\ngeocorona means that the attenuation factor for ions differs\non the differing pathways to the dayside. Additionally, ions\nwith different pitch angles mirror at different depths in the\ngeocorona. As a result of the differing loss rates, there are\nlanes of missing ions in the assembled distribution functions\non the dayside where various energies and pitch angles\nsuffered heavy attenuation from the geocorona [cf. Kistler et\nal., 1989, 1999; Jordanova et al., 1999]. An example is\nshown in Figure 15. Here five omni-directional ion distri-\nbution functions measured at various local times across the\ndayside magnetosphere by the MPA instrument on the\nspacecraft 1994-084 on 10 November 2004 are shown, with\none measured at local midnight (black) for comparison. As\nthe spacecraft 1994-084 moved across the dayside magne-\ntosphere on 10 November 2004, the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electrons\nat geosynchronous orbit were dropping out. When the\ndistributions at 14 LT (green), 16 LT (blue), and 18 LT\n(purple) in Figure 15 were measured, the spacecraft was\nsimultaneously in the superdense ion plasma sheet (with\nhot-ion pressure greater than 1 nPa) and the plasmaspheric\ndrainage plume (with cold-ion density greater than 10 cm\u00023)\nwhile the relativistic electrons were dropping out. As can be\nseen in Figure 15, the ion distribution functions in the\ndayside magnetosphere are not monotonic. The detailed\nstructure is caused by a combination of temporal source\npopulations, time-dependent convection, and shadowing by\nthe geocorona [cf. Mauk and Meng, 1983; Maurice et al.,\n1998; Korth et al., 2002]. The driving of EMIC waves by a\ngeocorona-produced temperature anisotropy of the dayside\nion plasma sheet has been explored [e.g., Cornwall, 1977;\nSolomon and Picon, 1981]; we suggest further that local\nregions of @f\/@v? produced by geocorona shadowing may\nalso play a role in EMIC growth [see also Kaye et al.,\n1979].\n[62] To summarize, five things conspire to produce strong\nEMIC wave growth and effective relativistic-electron scat-\ntering to produce the relativistic-electron dropouts.\n[63] 1. The ion plasma sheet becomes superdense owing\nto the high-density compressed slow wind of the CIR, and\nthis increases the free energy content of the plasma-sheet\nions.\n[64] 2. The superdense plasma sheet is extra-hot owing to\nthe vfast solar wind speed, which produces a hot magneto-\nsheath behind the bow shock, and this extra-hot plasma\nsheet has more free energy.\n[65] 3. The cold plasma of the plasmaspheric drainage\nplume is very lumpy, providing a medium in which ducting\nof EMIC waves yields better wave growth.\n[66] 4. The plasmaspheric drainage plumes extend across\nall dayside L shells from the plasmapause to the magneto-\npause, providing a medium for EMIC waves that can pitch-\nangle scatter radiation-belt particles at all L shells.\n[67] 5. The dark lanes in the distribution functions of the\ndayside ion plasma sheet may provide localized regions of\n@f\/@v? which may provide free energy in addition to\ntemperature anisotropy to drive the growth of EMIC waves.\n[68] Other mechanisms for eliminating relativistic elec-\ntrons from the magnetosphere have been proposed, includ-\ning pitch-angle scattering by plasmaspheric hiss inside the\nplasmasphere [e.g., Thorne et al., 1979; Horne et al., 2003;\nMeredith et al., 2004], pitch-angle scattering by whistler-\nmode chorus waves outside the plasmasphere [e.g.,\nTsurutani and Smith, 1974, 1977; Summers et al., 1998,\n2004; Smith et al., 2004; Albert, 2005], the Dst effect [e.g.,\nDessler and Karplus, 1961; Kim and Chan, 1997], magne-\ntopause shadowing [e.g., West et al., 1972; Li et al., 1997;\nDesorgher et al., 2000; Bortnik et al., 2006], and outward\nradial diffusion [e.g., Brautigam and Albert, 2000; Shprits\net al., 2006]. These other mechanisms may play a role, but\nour findings indicate that scattering by EMIC waves is the\nprimary candidate for the dropout loss mechanism.\n[69] As we have seen in section 4.2, recovery of the\nrelativistic-electron dropouts is associated with the decay of\nthe density and local-time width of plasmaspheric drainage\nplumes and with the superdense plasma sheet becoming an\nordinary-density plasma sheet. That is, recovery of the\nrelativistic-electron dropout is associated with a turnoff of\nthe strong EMIC growth region. Questions arise: Why don\u2019t\nthe relativistic-electron fluxes (and relativistic-electron\nnumber densities) stay low after the EMIC growth is shut\noff? Why do the relativistic-electron fluxes (and the rela-\ntivistic-electron densities: see Figure 1) increase rapidly\nwhen the EMIC scattering ceases? This will be the subject\nof a future study. It is clear that there is more to discover\nabout the recovery of relativistic-electron dropouts.\n6. Summary of Findings, Conclusions About\nDropouts, and Future Work\n[70] In sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 the detailed findings\nabout the onsets of relativistic-electron dropout, about the\nrecoveries of relativistic-electron dropouts, and about the\nabsences of relativistic-electron dropouts are summarized.\nMuch of that summary is incorporated into Table 1. In\nsection 6.4 the major conclusions about the cause of\nrelativistic-electron dropouts are stated. Finally, future\nresearch that is needed is described in section 6.5.\n6.1. Findings About Dropout Onsets\n[71] In section 4.1 superposed epoch studies of the solar\nwind and the magnetosphere were performed with the\ntrigger for the data alignment being the onset of relativistic-\nelectron dropouts at geosynchronous orbit. The findings of\nthose studies are the following:\n[72] 1. Dropout onsets are nearly simultaneous at all local\ntimes. Detailed fits to the superposed average of the\nlogarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron flux indicate that\nthe dropout commences first at dawn, then at midnight, then\nat dusk, and then at noon.\n[73] 2. At geosynchronous orbit, the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV elec-\ntrons require about 6 hours to fully drop out.\n[74] 3. The onset of relativistic-electron dropout occurs\nduring the passage of the compressed slow wind of the CIR,\nafter the passage of the sector reversal and before the\npassage of the stream interface.\n[75] 4. The onset of the relativistic-electron dropout is\nsimultaneous with the peak westward solar wind deflection\nof the CIR at the beginning of the solar wind-speed ramp.\n[76] 5. The onset of relativistic-electron dropout occurs at\nthe time of onset of the storm convection as measured by\nthe strong rise of the Kp index.\n[77] 6. The onset of the relativistic-electron dropout\noccurs while the Dst index is falling.\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n22 of 27\nA02201\n[78] 7. The onset of the relativistic-electron dropout\noccurs at same time as drainage-plume formation.\n[79] 8. The onset of the relativistic-electron dropout\noccurs at same time as the onset of the superdense ion\nplasma sheet.\n[80] 9. The onset of the relativistic-electron dropout\noccurs at same time as the onset of the extra-hot phase of\nion plasma sheet.\n[81] 10. The onset of relativistic-electron dropout occurs\nat same time as the onset of the superdense electron plasma\nsheet.\n[82] 11. The onset of relativistic-electron dropout occurs\nat the same time as the onset of the extra-hot phase of\nelectron plasma sheet.\n[83] 12. The onset of relativistic-electron dropout occurs\nwhen there is significant overlap of the superdense ion\nplasma sheet with the plasmaspheric drainage plume.\n6.2. Findings About Dropout Recoveries\n[84] In section 4.2 superposed epoch studies of the solar\nwind and the magnetosphere were performed with the\ntrigger for the data alignment being the recovery of relativ-\nistic-electron dropouts at geosynchronous orbit. The find-\nings of those studies are the following:\n[85] 1. The 1.1\u20131.5 MeV electron-dropout recovery at\ngeosynchronous orbit begins almost simultaneously at all\nlocal times: detailed fits to the superposed average of the\nlogarithm of the 1.1\u20131.5 MeVelectron flux indicate that the\ndropout commences first at midnight, then dusk, then noon,\nand then dawn.\n[86] 2. At geosynchronous orbit the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV elec-\ntrons require about 12\u201318 hours to recover.\n[87] 3. The flux of 1.1\u20131.5 MeVelectrons at geosynchro-\nnous orbit can be either higher or lower immediately after\nrecovery than before dropout.\n[88] 4. The relativistic-electron number density at geo-\nsynchronous orbit tends to be higher immediately after\nrecovery than it was before dropout.\n[89] 5. The relativistic-electron-dropout recovery occurs\nduring the passage of the compressed fast wind of the CIR,\nafter the passage of the stream interface.\n[90] 6. The relativistic-electron-dropout recovery ramp\nextends beyond the end of the CIR into the undisturbed\nfast wind. I.e. full recovery occurs when the fast wind after\nthe CIR is passing.\n[91] 7. The relativistic-electron-dropout recovery is not\nassociated with any change in the Kp or Dst indices.\n[92] 8. The relativistic-electron-dropout recovery occurs\nat same time as a strong decay in the properties of the\nplasmaspheric drainage plume.\n[93] 9. The relativistic-electron-dropout recovery occurs\nduring the slow decay of the superdense ion plasma sheet to\nordinary densities.\n[94] 10. The relativistic-electron-dropout recovery is not\nassociated with a change in extra-hot phase of ion plasma\nsheet. The extra-hot phase continues long after the dropout\nrecovers.\n[95] 11. The relativistic-electron-dropout recovery occurs\nduring the slow decay of the superdense electron plasma\nsheet to ordinary densities.\n[96] 12. The relativistic-electron-dropout recovery is not\nassociated with a change in extra-hot phase of electron\nplasma sheet. The extra-hot phase continues long after the\ndropout recovers.\n[97] 13. The relativistic-electron-dropout recovery occurs\nwhen the significant overlap between the superdense ion\nplasma sheet and the drainage plume ends.\n6.3. Findings About the Absence of Dropouts\n[98] In section 4.3 superposed epoch studies of the solar\nwind and the magnetosphere were performed for storms that\nhad neither relativistic-electron dropout nor recovery, with\nthe trigger for the data alignment being the onset of storm\nlevels of magnetospheric convection. The findings of those\nstudies are the following:\n[99] 1. When there is no relativistic-electron dropout, no\nsuperdense ion plasma sheet occurs.\n[100] 2. When there is no relativistic-electron dropout, no\nsuperdense electron plasma sheet occurs.\n[101] 3. When there is no relativistic-electron dropout,\ndrainage plumes still form, but the plumes are weak.\n[102] 4. When there is no relativistic-electron dropout, the\nextra-hot phase of the ion plasma sheet still occurs.\n[103] 5. When there is no relativistic-electron dropout, the\nextra-hot phase of the electron plasma sheet still occurs.\n6.4. Conclusions About Relativistic-Electron Dropouts\n[104] From the examination of the magnetosphere phased\nwith the onsets and recoveries of relativistic-electron drop-\nouts, it appears that dropouts are caused by the combination\nof a superdense plasma sheet and a plasmaspheric drainage\nplume. The scenario envisioned is that when the superdense\nion plasma sheet spatially overlaps the plasmaspheric drain-\nage plume, the two phenomena act in concert to produce\nEMIC waves which pitch-angle scatter the relativistic elec-\ntrons into the atmospheric loss cone. About 6 hours of\nscattering is required to deplete the 1.1\u20131.5 MeV relativis-\ntic-electron population at geosynchronous orbit, the popu-\nlation stays depleted for about 6\u201320 hours, and the recovery\nof the fluxes take about 12\u201318 hours.\n[105] The origin of the superdense plasma sheet is the\ncompressed slow wind of the CIR ahead of the stream\ninterface. This high-density plasma enters into the magne-\ntosphere with about a 2\u20138 hour time lag to produce the\nsuperdense plasma sheet at geosynchronous orbit.\n[106] The origin of the plasmaspheric drainage plume is\nthe enhanced magnetospheric convection associated with\nsouthward (GSM) solar wind magnetic field after the\npassage of the IMF sector reversal prior to the passage of\nthe CIR stream interface.\n[107] For storms without relativistic-electron dropouts,\nsuperdense plasma sheets are not present.\n6.5. Future Work Needed\n[108] The relativistic-electron dropouts investigated in the\npresent study all occurred during high-speed-stream-driven\nstorms. Relativistic-electron dropouts also need to be stud-\nied in CME-driven storms. Because the CME-driven storms\nare more variable than are high-speed-stream-driven storms,\nthe dropouts or lack of dropouts under more-varying con-\nditions can be studied. In particular, CME-driven storms\nwith plasmaspheric drainage plumes but without superdense\nplasma sheets (or vice versa) will be of great interest to\nconfirm or modify the conclusions of the present study.\nA02201 BOROVSKY AND DENTON: RELATIVISTIC-ELECTRON DROPOUTS\n23 of 27\nA02201\n[109] It has been suggested here that the plentiful density\ngradients within plasmaspheric drainage plumes may be of\nimportance for the ducting of EMIC waves and the\nimprovement of their growth. The lumpiness of plasma-\nspheric drainage plumes needs to be studied and quantified\nwith higher-resolution plasma measurements to enable a\nbetter theoretical assessment of the impact of the lumpiness\non the EMIC wave growth.\n[110] It has also been suggested here that the lanes of\nmissing ions in the three-dimensional ion distribution func-\ntions may provide an additional source of free energy (i.e.\n@f\/@v?) for the growth of EMIC waves in the dayside\nmagnetosphere. A survey of the properties of the ion\ndistribution functions of the dayside magnetosphere is\ncalled for and a theoretical assessment of their importance\nfor EMIC wave growth should be performed.\n[111] Finally, when the relativistic-electron flux recovers\nfrom a dropout, the relativistic-electron number density\nimmediately after the recovery can have a considerable\nrange of values. This number density represents a funda-\nmental measure of the new population of electrons that are\navailable in the subsequent days of the storm to be heated to\nproduce the several-day-long increase in the relativistic-\nelectron fluxes through the storm [cf. Borovsky et al.,\n1998a]. Learning what factors determine the density of\nrelativistic electrons when they enter the outer dipole at\nrecovery will be important for determining the ultimate\nlevel of relativistic-electron fluxes late in the storm.\n[112] Acknowledgments.
