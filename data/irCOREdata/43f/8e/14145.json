Masikunas et al.\nPowerPointVote System (PPVOTE) in first-year marketing and business studies\nmodules.\nThis article begins with background information on how we proposed to use EVS-\nstyle interactive lectures to address issues raised by student evaluations. We then\npresent the potential benefits of using EVS-style lectures, how we believed we could\nmake best use of EVS as a tool for improving student learning and how the literature\non EVS supported our thinking. We go on to discuss how we prepared for and\nimplemented the interactive EVS-style lectures and the associated evaluative research\nto measure the impact on student learning and achievement.\nIn most higher education institutions the lecture is the widely accepted method of\nknowledge transmission (Jarvis, 2002); however, research shows that the traditional\nstyle of lecture is the least-favoured method of instruction (Butler, 1992; Bligh, 2000).\nBligh (2000) suggests that lectures are mostly useful for imparting information but\nnot for developing powerful minds. This echoes Boyer (1990), who suggested that: \nGreat teachers create a common ground of intellectual commitment. They stimulate\nactive, not passive, learning and encourage students to be critical, creative thinkers, with\nthe capacity to go on learning \u2026 (p. 24)\nAs a teaching team we became aware of a range of problems with traditional\nlectures for first-year undergraduate students in marketing and business studies.\nOur students were telling us that the traditional lectures were \u2018a bit of a turn off\u2019.\nInternal feedback from our students led us to realise that our traditional lectures\nwere not serving their purpose. Several problems with the traditional face-to-face\nlecture format were identified from both students and lecturers, particularly with\nlarge classes: \n\u25cf a general lack of student engagement during lectures, both with the material\npresented, and with their peers;\n\u25cf large classes typically do not allow students an opportunity to present their\nopinions and to receive immediate feedback; and\n\u25cf there was little opportunity for lecturers to test students\u2019 understanding of material\nbefore moving on to new material.\nWe undertook an analysis of our traditional lectures using Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy of the\nCognitive Domain (Bloom, 1956). Our students gave high scores to our lectures for\nBloom\u2019s lower-order cognitive skills (knowledge and comprehension) and low scores\nfor higher-order cognitive skills (application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation). Our\nintention was that a new-style interactive lecture would score reasonably high for both\nsets of cognitive skills.\nThe potential for using EVS-style interactive lectures\nWe decided that, by using EVS as the basis for interactive lectures, we wanted to\nachieve a number of things in terms of enhancing student learning. We wanted\nto: \nEVS in lectures within business and marketing 5\n\u25cf create a stimulating learning environment in the lecture room that would engage\nstudents through making them active rather than passive learners;\n\u25cf enhance students\u2019 overall performance in the Year One modules;\n\u25cf reduce the number of assessment retakes;\n\u25cf improve retention rates;\n\u25cf build self-confidence in the students through encouraging participation; and\n\u25cf stimulate student\u2013student interactions and student\u2013teacher interaction in a way\nthat led to a shared process of knowledge-building.\nMazur (1997) and Dufresne et al. (1996) implemented EVS into interactive\nlectures with the aim of developing students\u2019 cognitive skills. Mazur (1997) also\nwished to foster collaborative learning through integrating peer\u2013student instruction\nas an integral element of an EVS-style interactive lecture. Others (for example, Eliot,\n2001) suggested that using EVS in lectures is appropriate in subject disciplines that\nare perceived to be particularly challenging to student learning; for example, physical\nsciences, engineering, computing and statistics: \n\u2026 I was aware that it was a course that students have historically found challenging.\nFurther, in a lecture environment the students may be unwilling to volunteer information\nregarding their level of understanding of the material covered. (Eliot, 2001, p. 80)\nBoyle and Nichol (2003) said that: \nThe aim [of introducing EVS-style interactive lectures] was to aid students\u2019 transition into\nhigher education, improve retention, give a better first year experience and introduce\nactive learning and discussion concepts into large classes. (p. 43)\nLui et al. (2003) used EVS to overcome the communicative limitations that large\nlectures traditionally create and to enable students to construct deeper meaning in\nterms of the content presented in lectures. Others (for example, Horowitz, 1988;\nHake, 1996; Abrahamson, 1999) adopted student response systems in lectures with\nthe aim of improving learners\u2019 attention or increasing assessment scores, or to\nfacilitate interaction between students in the lecture (Sarah, 2002).\nHake (1996) concluded that interactive engagement in student learning was\npreferable to traditional classroom teaching and: \n\u2026 strongly suggests that the classroom use of IE [interactive engagement] methods can\nincrease mechanics-course effectiveness well beyond that obtained by traditional practice.\n(p. 72)\nLaurillard (1993) presented a persuasive argument for interactive lectures in terms\nof the essential role that feedback plays in student learning. She suggested that action\non the part of the learner without some sort of feedback is unproductive and that\nreceiving meaningful and useful feedback is important for student learning.\nPlan for using EVS in our marketing and business modules\nWe proposed to use the EVS-style lecture to: \n6 G. Masikunas et al.\n\u25cf deliver interactive lectures that incorporated information giving, small-group\nlearning to answer specific questions\/complete group learning tasks, and group\ndecision-making;\n\u25cf use an EVS that enabled students to communicate their answers to the group activ-\nity and instantly converted students\u2019 responses (in the form of a histogram\nprojected onto a screen at the front of the lecture room);\n\u25cf use this process to provide formative feedback to all students through which they\ncould judge their own responses against those of others and against the correct\nresponse provided by the teacher; and\n\u25cf improve student concentration in lectures, promote deeper approaches to learning\nand enable students to develop a wider range of cognitive skills (Bloom, 1956;\nRenshaw, 1995).\nIn drawing up our plans we were mindful of some barriers to its success, including\npotential concerns by students that less material might be covered in interactive EVS-\nstyle lectures, a concern that students might focus more on achieving better marks\nand that students might use the group-activity time in the lecture to socialise rather\nthan complete the activity.\nSelection of the EVS system\nThe EVS system we selected needed to be congruent with promoting different types\nof learning and the aims we identified for this project.\nWe wanted interactive EVS-style lectures that would appeal to all types of learner\nstyles, but that would especially promote the \u2018Deep Active\u2019 type (Marton, 1994). We\nwere mindful, too, of work by Brown and Brailsford (2004), who suggested that\nlearners are adapters whose learning styles can change according to the learning\nenvironment. The EVS system we selected would change the learning environment\nof lectures and needed to help us to bring together interactivity, group problem-\nsolving following freshly taught material, and peer teaching and feedback to students.\nFinally, we also took into account the work of other pioneers in the use of EVS\nsystems in teaching and learning (Horowitz, 1988; Dufresne et al., 1996; Mazur,\n1997; Crouch & Mazur, 2001; Liu et al., 2003; Draper & Brown, 2004).\nIntroduction of the innovation\nAfter comparing different EVS systems we elected to use the Personal Response\nSystem supplied by Educue for our mass-attended classes. The systems purchase did\nrequire certain additional hardware and software conditions to be met. These were\nsatisfied by the information technology provision in the lecture theatres across the\nuniversity. There is a university-wide network linked to a proprietary virtual learning\nsystem, which feeds into classrooms where a data-projection system is run from a\nstand-alone computer linked to large screens or electronic white boards. This infor-\nmation-technology-enriched classroom met the hardware and software pre-requisite.\nEVS in lectures within business and marketing 7\nAbsence of this would have constituted a major barrier to adoption of the EVS-style\nlecture.\nPreparation for the innovation\nPreparation involved a variety of events, including gaining funding approval, purchas-\ning, staff training in the use of EVS, practice sessions in our lecture halls using EVS,\nand embedding dedicated EVS-focused slides (with group work questions and possi-\nble answers) into the PowerPoint presentation.\nPractice sessions allowed us to load the special EVS-dedicated software onto the\ncomputer in the lecture hall, ensuring that the sensor device could pick up responses\nfrom the remote controls used to signal student choice from the answers offered.\nThe commitment involved and timing of lectures became significant elements of\nthe plans for implementing this innovation. Time was needed at the beginning of each\nlecture to set up the EVS system in the lecture hall, distribute remote control panels,\nallow students to form small teams of three to five, undertake the integrated EVS-type\nquestion and answer sessions, and ensure that the equipment was taken away at the\nend of the lecture session. We will come back to discuss how the use of time in the\nlecture changed as a result of moving to EVS-style interactive lectures.\nImplementation of the innovation\nSuggestions for sequencing of learning activities in an interactive EVS-style lecture\nvary in the literature. Mazur (1997) and Dufresne et al. (1996) propose different\nsequences in an EVS-style interactive lecture. The major difference between the two\nlies in the extent to which it is the individual student who answers the question\/\nproblem posed, or the small group who agrees an answer. Mazur (1997) favoured an\nindividual-student approach, while Dufresne et al. (1996) proposed a group-wide\nsequence for providing the answers.\nNicol and Boyle (2003) reported that students in one university found Mazur\u2019s\npeer instruction sequence to be more helpful to their learning in preference to the\nclassroom-wide sequence advocated by Dufresne et al. (1996). The two lecturers\ninvolved in this project created similar sequences, both of which are based on Dufesne\net al. (1996), but with some minor adaptations. Figure 1 illustrates how EVS operates\nwithin the following sequence of events in an interactive lecture.\nFigure 1. The EVS learning cycle and sequenceThe EVS involves distribution of remote handsets and dividing the large group into\nsmall work groups of three to five students. The lecturer then introduces a new piece\nof module content that has a question\/learning task posed, and a set of possible\nanswers. Each small group discusses the question\/completes the task and, through\ncollaboration, interactivity, group decision-making and discussion, agrees their\nanswer as a group. In this process, students are encouraged to be involved in peer\nstudent teaching where individual group members explain their reasoning for\nselecting a given answer. As part of the discussion, the group evaluates each possible\nanswer from the choices, before agreeing an answer.\n8 G. Masikunas et al.\nGroup answers are submitted by pressing the appropriate button on the remote\nhandset, which is picked up by sensors linked to a computer that projects the results\nof all the responses. The voting process takes a very short time. A histogram is generated\nthat displays on a screen in the front to the lecture room the overall outcome choices.\nAt this point the lecturer can do a number of things: \n\u25cf Indicate the correct answer and give the reasoning to support it, followed by a\nclassroom-wide discussion allowing team members to support\/explain their choice.\n\u25cf Follow-on discussion, but without giving the correct answer, repeat the question\nallowing every team to answer again, permitting statistical comparison on any\nchanges in voting.\n\u25cf Give the correct answer, with reasoning, followed by a summary.\nThe lecture continues with new taught material, followed by a second EVS sequence.\nThe sequence presented in Figure 1 can be repeated a number of times during the\nlecture. EVS was first used in the lectures presented by the module leader for the\nBusiness Information Systems module. Approximately 240 students undertook this\n\u0000\u0001\u0002 \u0004\u0005\u0006\u0005\u0007\u0005 \b\u0002\t\n\u000b\f\u000b\r \u000e\u000f\u0010\u0011\u0002\n\b\u0002\u0010\u0012\u0013\n\u0002\n\u0014\u0015 \u0016\u0002\u0002\u0017\u0018\t\u0010\u0019\n\u0000\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0005\u0006 \b\t\u0005\u0004\n\n\n\u000b\f \u0003\u0005\r\r\f\u0003\n \b\u0006\u0002\u000e\f\r\n\b\u0002\t\n\u000b\f\u000b\r\n\n\u000b\r\u0005\u0004\u000f\u000b \u0010\u0001\u0002\u0004\b\u0011\n\r\f\u0002\u0004\u0011\n\u0002 \u0005\u0012 \u0010\u0005\n\u0001\u0006\u000f\n\u0013\r\u0005\u0004\u0014\n\u0000\f\u0003\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0005\u0006\n\u0002\u0004\t\u0015\u0001\n\n\f\u0016\n\u0010\u0001\b\n\u0003\u0011\u0001\u0003\u0017\b\u0014\b\u0016\n\u0018\u0004\f\u0002\n\u0001\u0005\u0006\n\u0002\f\n \n\u000b\r\u0005\u0004\u000f\u000b\n\u0019\u0019 \u001a\u001b\u001c\u001d\n\b\u0002\u0010\u0012\u0013\n\u0002\n\n\u0012\u0002\t\u0010\u0001\u0002\u0015\n\u000b\u0002\u001a \u001b\t\u0012\u0002\n\f\t\u0011 \u001e\n\u0004\u0016\f\u0006\n\u0002\u001f\n\u0014\f\r\u0003\f\u0014\n\u0004\b\u0011\n\u0014\r\u0005\u0003\f\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0006\u000f\n \u0003\n\u0001\u0010\f !\f\b\r\u0006\u0001\u0006\u000f\n\n\u000b\r\u0005\u0004\u000f\u000b \u000f\r\u0005\u0004\u0014\n\u0016\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0005\u0006\n\"\u0005\u0006\u0012\u0001\r\u0015\b\n\u0001\u0005\u0006\nFigure 1. The EVS learning cycle and sequence\nEVS in lectures within business and marketing 9\nmodule together. Other lecturers observed these sessions and shortly afterwards the\nEVS-style lecture was adopted for the remainder of Year One modules undertaken by\nthe same students. The features that impressed the other lecturers, and that led them\nto adopt this approach, included the students\u2019 response to this new style of lecturing\nand the way students engaged with each other, with the lecturers and with the course\ncontent, during the EVS-style lectures.\nWhen we implemented the EVS-style lecture we became aware that use of the\nlecture time changed with EVS-style lectures. Figure 2 shows the typical time alloca-\ntion used in our traditional-style lectures as compared with the use of lecture time in\nEVS-interactive style lectures.\nFigure 2. Typical time allocation for traditional lectures compared with EVS-interactive style lectures\nThe evaluation framework\nOur research objectives with respect to student learning were, firstly, to measure\nstudents\u2019 perceptions about the use of EVS in large-group lectures, and, secondly, to\nidentify and explore the specific factors that increased the effectiveness of learning in\nan interactive lecture using EVS. Additionally, we wished to examine students\u2019 atti-\ntudes and feelings about EVS lectures. We also wanted to examine the extent to which\nquantitative data (achievement and progression) correlated with qualitative data.\nA decision was taken to undertake an evaluative research project using case study\ndesign (Alvarez et al., 1990; Brearley, 1993; Greenwald, 1991; Yin, 1994; Carney,\n1995; Tellis, 1997). Selecting an evaluative research framework is important to\nensure that an innovation is subject to rigorous scrutiny and measures the extent to\nwhich success criteria or proposed outcomes are achieved. This assures that\neducational ends precede technological means.\nData collection and analysis\nA case study as an evaluative research design lends itself to using a number of data\ncollection methods. We focused the evaluative case study on measuring the impact of\nEVS lecture time utilisation\nIntroduction\n10%\nConclussion\n10%\nInteraction\n36%\nLecture\n44%\nTraditional lecture time utilisation\nIntroduction\n6%\nLecture\n68%\nInteraction\n20%\nConclusion\n6%\nFigure 2. Typical time allocation for traditional lectures compared with EVS-interactive style \nlectures\n10 G. Masikunas et al.\nEVS-style lectures on student learning and achievement. Data were collected using\nsurvey questionnaires, focus groups and quantitative data related to assessment\nresults.\nWe undertook a survey of students that involved the distribution of a questionnaire\nto those students who attended the Marketing and the Business Information Systems\nmodules. These survey questionnaires were distributed to students in week six of their\nmodules. We also undertook focus group interviews with a sample of students to\nrecord and analyse their ideas, feelings, attitudes and perceptions about their EVS\nexperience and its impact on their learning. Quantitative data about assessment\nresults were obtained from minutes of examination board meetings.\nThe survey questionnaire yielded both qualitative and quantitative data. The\nquestionnaires and focus groups were analysed using thematic analysis (Aronson,\n1994). Thematic analysis involved identifying patterns in the data and classifying data\naccording to these, finding themes from within these and then determining which of\nthese themes were key themes; that is, those that form a comprehensive picture of the\ncollective experience of the stakeholders.\nIn addition to thematic analysis of the qualitative data, we used the quantitative\ndata about student performance in assessments to ascertain any differences in\nassessment marks for these students, compared with previous first-year students who\nundertook these modules through traditional lectures.\nFindings\nThe response rate for the survey questionnaire was 40% (n = 165). Analysis of the\nsurvey questionnaires indicated that students perceived the effectiveness of their\nlearning was improved through the EVS lectures (mean response rate, 4.25 out of 5).\nThematic analysis of the survey questionnaires enabled us to identify the following\nthemes that contributed to this improved learning: \n\u25cf Enjoyment of the EVS-style lectures.\n\u25cf Consultation\/participation.\n\u25cf Reinforcement feedback.\n\u25cf Team decision-making.\n\u25cf Student interactivity.\n\u25cf Student perceptions of the role of lectures.\nData from the focus groups confirmed that these were the key themes related to\nstudent learning and achievement. Each of these themes are now discussed in turn.\nEnjoyment of the EVS-style lectures was a recurring theme from the survey question-\nnaires and focus groups. The majority of students expressed a high degree of satisfac-\ntion with the EVS-style lectures. Analysis of the survey questionnaires gave an\naggregate score of 4.7 out of 5 for the question on enjoyment. \nLectures have come alive. Before, in most classes, I think most students were not listening.\nSome people sitting next to you did not want to know.\nEVS in lectures within business and marketing 11\nConsultation\/ participation was identified as a factor in improving learning, with a\nmean score of 4.35 out of 5. Three types of consultation\/participation emerged from\nthe focus groups as having a positive impact on learning. Students having the\nopportunity: \n\u25cf to be active in the large group lecture;\n\u25cf to discuss problems with others in their small group; and\n\u25cf to discuss issues with the lecturer within the lecture, thus opening up a new\nchannel of communication between lecturer and student and instigating a change\nin the student\u2013lecturer relationship.\nReinforcement feedback as part of the learning process during the EVS lectures\nemerged as another theme (mean score, 4.45). In one of several responses about\nreinforcement and feedback, a student commented that when the lecturer gave the\ncorrect answer after the EVS activity, it was an extension of: \n\u2026 revising my understanding and \u2026 a function of learning reinforcement.\nWhat this seemed to say was that feedback and reinforcement from lecturers helped\nthis student to re-think his understanding of the content and reinforced learning.\nStudents viewed the EVS-style lecture as a means of providing them with feedback\nabout newly taught material, and some came to see this as confirming or challenging\nthe meaning they had constructed and derived. Where their response was \u2018correct\u2019\nthey saw this as providing positive reinforcement, whereas \u2018wrong responses\u2019 helped\nto clarify a taught concept so that their state of knowledge was \u2018on track\u2019, which\ncounts as another form of \u2018reinforcement\u2019.\nFeedback and reinforcement within the EVS lectures was very important to most\nstudents, and helped to develop their confidence, as the following quotes illustrate: \nFurther discussion or re-explanation was given to bridge the learning gap.\nIt motivates to get feedback about what you learned.\nIt gives us confidence, if the answer is right \u2026 and if you answer wrong you will see the\ncorrect answer later on and there\u2019s a bigger chance for you to remember that answer.\nTeam decision-making was another emerging theme (mean score, 4.6) that had a\npositive impact on students\u2019 perceptions of their learning. A number of reasons for\nthis were identified by students in the questionnaires and focus groups. Team\ndecision-making gave students opportunities to look at different options for problem-\nsolving and decision-making. \n\u2026 you get to know more about the other options \u2026\n\u2026 you would think that this option would be right, but you think on the other option as\nwell \u2026\nTeam decision-making was seen as positive because of the opportunities it gave\nstudents to find out why each student believed certain answers to be correct. \n\u2026 you can ask a person in your group who has given the \u2018A\u2019 answer, \u2018How do you come\nto the answer A\u2019 \u2026\n12 G. Masikunas et al.\nAnother recurring response was the positive effect of learning from others in groups\n(peer instruction). A third recurring response was that of developing self-confidence\nthrough joint decision-making. \nIt [joint decision-making] builds your confidence.\nA small minority of students said that they would have preferred to have been given\nindividual handsets so that they could work through the questions on their own rather\nthan within a small group. This response tended to come from the earliest focus\ngroup. The issue of some students preferring to work independently rather than as\npart of a team did not appear in later focus groups. This may be due to the fact the\nearly focus group took place prior to the first module assessment and assessment\nresults from the first module demonstrated an improvement in results from previous\nyears. In addition, if students were to tackle the problems posted in the EVS lecture\non their own, rather than in a group, the element of peer learning would be lost. The\nperceptions of the majority of students in this study were that peer learning was\nvaluable and enhanced their individual learning.\nInteractivity and the positive impact on learning that interactivity within the EVS-\nstyle lecture created was a theme that emerged from the survey questionnaires (mean\nscore, 4.7). An overwhelming majority of students appreciated having the time to\nwork in small groups during the large lecture, and preferred group working and group\ndecision-making. Most students felt that having the opportunity to interact in the\nlecture enhanced the learning experience. \nIt was completely different from the way you assumed the lecture was going to be like.\nThere was a group vibe; everyone conferred and you got to be in your group. There was a\nquestion in front of you and everyone had a discussion.\nStudents reported that the interactivity in class spilled over into their interactions with\nfellow students after the class was over. Some students reported, however, that when\nother students did not take the group discussion\/team decision-making time\nseriously, this detracted from their learning.\nStudents\u2019 perception of the value of the role of lectures emerged as a theme from the\nfocus groups particularly. The majority favourably compared the EVS lecture with\ntraditional lectures in terms of enhancing their learning effectiveness. Analysis of the\ndata, however, showed a very complex picture about how students perceive that their\nlearning takes place. \nWe are really learning more.\nWe can really learn with our group. I do not have to spend ages re-reading my lecture notes\nto get it.\n\u2026 felt I really understood the basics; the concepts of marketing. Before, I was not so sure.\n\u2026 if it [EVS] helps you to know, then learning this way is good.\nIn addition, the value of learning from fellow-students emerged from the data. \nYou can join up with your friends in small groups. You learn from your mates.\nEVS in lectures within business and marketing 13\nHowever, a very small number of students expressed concern about optimum use of\nlecture time. \n\u2026 worried that we will not cover everything in time for the exams and we will get lower\ngrades even though we enjoyed it.\nThese students also expressed concern about the amount of \u2018dead time\u2019 in the EVS\nlecture (e.g. time spent handing out and collecting in the remote voting devices).\nThis appears to indicate a deep concern on the part of a small number of students\nabout their overall performance in a module. Those who expressed concerns related\nto optimum use of lecture time may have been demonstrating that their discomfort of\nnew approaches to learning could adversely affect their level of achievement.\nIn terms of assessment results, we found that student average aggregate performance\nimproved for both modules in 2003\/04 compared with the previous cohort of students.\nThe student profile was similar across both cohorts and the same module leaders gave\nthe lectures in both years. The variable was that in the 2003\/04 cohort the lectures\nwere interactive using EVS. For both modules the average aggregate student marks\nrose, from 56% in the 2002\/03 first-year cohort to 59% in the 2003\/04 cohort.\nDiscussion\nFrom the data analysis we suggest that there may be a model emerging that depicts\nthree stages experienced by students arising from a sequence of EVS-style lectures.\nStage 1: early mass acceptance\nThis occurred in the early period when EVS was launched and where there was\nimmediate and widespread acceptance. The vast majority of students described their\ninitial experiences of EVS in large-group lectures as highly satisfactory, and this may\nreflect their engagement with the new. There might also have been a halo effect\narising from lecturer enthusiasm for EVS.\nStudents made initial comparisons between the traditional lectures and EVS\nlectures, appreciating the new benefits delivered by EVS. The features that struck\nthem as special to EVS included interactivity, engagement, group and peer instruc-\ntion, rapid feedback of student responses and better understanding.\nTheir attitudes and feelings towards the use of EVS were strongly held and felt. In\nstage 1 the novelty factor is pervasive, and students express that this style of lecture\nrelieves the monotony of traditional lectures.\nStage 2: reflection\nThis occurs when students start a deeper reassessment of their newer blended\nlearning environment created through the EVS lecture. They clearly begin to articu-\nlate the difference between traditional and EVS-style lectures and the effect that both\nhave on their learning. They also begin to assess and analyse the strengths and\n14 G. Masikunas et al.\nweaknesses of both types of lectures. For some students, reservations begin to appear.\nEVS lectures are still seen as enjoyable but some students begin to perceive distrac-\ntions when other students do not take the group discussion time seriously. The\neuphoria of the first stage passes and students demonstrate a more reflective view in\nrelation to EVS as a process. As one student stated: \nThe novelty wore off, but I still liked it.\nFrom our findings, students start to fall into a number of clusters according to their\nideas, feelings, perceptions and attitudes: \n\u25cf Type 1: \u2018Must have it\u2019.\n\u25cf Type 2: \u2018Need it but with minor reservations\u2019.\n\u25cf Type 3: \u2018Sceptical about it but it needs to improve\u2019.\nType 1 students are those who liked this way of learning. Type 2 and type 3 students\ndemonstrated more reflective and divergent thinking about EVS. Our focus groups\nindicated that students who had very fixed ideas about the traditional lecture, and\nwho came from educational systems where there was an extremely strong belief in the\n\u2018professor-model\u2019, found it more difficult to accept EVS in the large-group lecture.\nThis will be the subject of further investigation in the future.\nStudents in the reflection stage (stage 2) demonstrated clear ideas about the char-\nacteristics of a good lecture. Features they identified include: \nCovers the material and covers it well.\nInformation is well-explained.\nOne where you are interacting.\nDepends upon lecturer style and charisma.\nStage 3: \u2018divergence\u2019\nThis is the stage when students become more sophisticated about EVS, and is\ninformed by the constructive reflections of the students who fell into types 2 and 3 in\nthe previous stage. Both these types are very clear about both their reservations and\nenthusiasm, but type 3 students go further by presenting constructive ways of over-\ncoming any perceived defects or redefining new roles and applications for EVS as an\ninteractive tool. Those students in type 3 appear to be protecting the EVS ideology.\nIn addition, the students who demonstrate divergence also showed evidence of high-\nlevel skill development by applying marketing concepts to extended use of EVS in\nlectures. They appeared to take marketing and customer orientation concepts and use\nthem to: \n\u25cf propose new uses for EVS to meet other needs; and\n\u25cf suggest product improvement to the existing use of EVS.\nThese students exhibited maturity in defining EVS in terms of their perceived learn-\ning needs, and realised other educational needs which EVS could be used to service.\nEVS in lectures within business and marketing 15\nThe divergence stage symbolises a major shift in the way students think about EVS\nand their own learning. Most students, but particularly those who fell into type 3,\nwant to be consulted, but indicate that they feel a part ownership of EVS with the\nlecturers who adopted this interactive lecture method.\nThose students in the divergence stage strongly defended the continued value of\nlectures as a teaching method, provided it included EVS. \nWith me there are a lot of external influences. If there were no lectures I would not learn\nanything.\nI particularly like it [the EVS style lecture] when it is part of learning rather than part of\nassessment.\nI think PRS [Personal Response System] should be made more interactive.\nThis final quote indicates how this student reflected on the experience of the\nEVS-style lecture. Students in stage 3 went beyond merely defending the survival\nof the lecture, especially the EVS-style lecture, to expressing the further potential\nof EVS and identifying other areas where this technology could be applied.\nSome suggestions that students in this group made for improving EVS lectures\nincluded: \n\u25cf simplifying the start-up and close-down of a EVS lecture;\n\u25cf equipping lecture halls with permanently fixed EVS equipment;\n\u25cf using EVS to obtain individual responses to set questions in semester 1 lectures\nbefore moving to group interaction and group answers to set questions in semester\n2 (or vice versa); and\n\u25cf proposing different ways of allocating students to small groups with well-thought\nthrough reasons for doing this.\nIn addition, students in stage 3 offered suggestions related to extending the use of\nEVS to other learning activities. Suggestions included: \n\u25cf using EVS as a formal testing mechanism linked to student performance in the\nmodule;\n\u25cf using it as a revision tool before examinations;\n\u25cf applying EVS to modules that use problem sheets, such as in financial accounting\nand quantitative studies modules.\nWe are exploring ways of using these suggestions in other learning activities.\nFinally, students in stage 3 also went beyond merely identifying the characteristics\nof a good lecture. They offered suggestions as to how feedback and interaction in the\nEVS-lecture could be expanded, including: \n\u25cf enabling individual students to answer the set question and giving individual feed-\nback on answers;\n\u25cf exploring ways of using whole group interaction;\n\u25cf greater use of mini-cases\u2014using them as a pre-test and then post-test; and\n\u25cf integrating results into tutorial work.\n16 G. Masikunas et al.\nOur data did not provide an explanation as to why students in stage 3 made these\nsuggestions. From their responses, however, we can assume that the impact of EVS\non their learning in interactive lectures has led them to conclude that its application\nin other learning activities would also be of benefit to them.\nOur study begins to shed some light on what provides meaningful ways of learning\nfrom the students\u2019 perspective. The literature related to learning theory indicates\nways of mapping our findings against the different explanations and paradigms about\nhow learning best takes place and how different teaching methods represent different\nunderstandings of learning.\nFrom the findings related to the themes of team decision-making and interactivity,\nand the comments by a small minority of students that they would rather have worked\non their own on the problems set during the lectures, we recognise that some skills\nmay be best learned independently rather than as a part of group learning activities.\nThere is little in the literature about this and, therefore, this is a subject for future\nstudy and exploration. However, given the studies by Mazur (1997) and Dufresne\net al. (1996) and their emphasis on the importance of group learning, we would be\nreluctant at this time to lose the group learning element of the EVS lecture.\nDifferent paradigms of teaching\nIt appears that EVS-style lectures combine a range of pedagogical approaches in an\ninteractive learning experience. We therefore decided to try to map the students\u2019\nperceptions in our findings to a framework of different pedagogical approaches.\nRenshaw (1995) suggests a framework of four models for defining and describing\nlearning and teaching. These are outlined in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Contrasting approaches to learning and teaching (adapted from Renshaw, 1995)What this suggests is that different explanations of learning and teaching determine\nthe place of a range of pedagogical approaches in a programme of study. Figure 3 also\ndemonstrates differences between the traditional and the interactive EVS lecture.\nTraditional lectures sit firmly within Renshaw\u2019s transmission model, while the\ninteractive EVS lecture combines aspects of all four models.\nIt is our contention that the EVS-style interactive lecture provides learning\nopportunities within all four models of learning and teaching, and therefore\npromotes deep active learning in the students. In addition, the themes that\nemerged from our findings show that students\u2019 perceptions of EVS and its value\nspan all four of Renshaw\u2019s models of learning and teaching. For example, the\ncomments from students within the theme consultation and participation indicate\nthe value that students place on constructivist\/social constructivist learning. The\nsocial (and academic) community in which the student lives and works plays a\ncentral role in helping students to understand new concepts in a meaningful way.\nIn addition, Vygotsky (1978) emphasised the importance that other people in\nthe student\u2019s academic world have in developing the mental processes of that\nstudent.\nIn addition, the theme from the student data, reinforcement and feedback, demon-\nstrates the value students place on learning in a transmission model. The themes of\nEVS in lectures within business and marketing 17\nThe Transmission Model\nLearning is: Teaching is:\nPerforming a task Giving information\ncorrectly\nCumulative Sequential\nReceptive Direct\nFrom the outside in Structuring the\nenvironment\nPractising\/performing Rewarding\nperformance\nThe Constructivist Model\nLearning is: Teaching is:\nPersonal Setting challenging\nUnderstanding tasks\nInterpretative\/ Observing\/\nselective interviewing\nActive Supporting learner\nactivity\nConstructive\nReviewing\/integrating Helping learners to\nreconsider \nThe Metacognitive Model\nLearning is: Teaching is:\nMindful engagement Explaining\nmeaning\/experience \nThe Social Constructivist Model\n(Socio-cultural Model)\nLearning is: Teaching is:\nSocial Joint activity\nAssisted performance Scaffolding\nCreating dissonance\nManaging learning Modelling learning\ntasks strategically strategies\nReflecting and\nmonitoring reflection\nSupporting\nAdapting and Helping to apply\n transferring across contexts\nself-evaluating Providing evaluation\ncriteria\nParticipation\nInteractive and Guiding the\nCo-constructive conversation\nSelf-regulating Assisting in\ngroup membership joint construction\nof meaning\nEvaluating with shared Demonstrating\nvalues community\/\nprofessional values\nFigure 3.

Masikunas et al.\ninteractivity and team decision-making indicate the importance that students place on\nsocial constructivist\/metacognitive approaches to learning and teaching, where learn-\ning is influenced by social interaction and collaborative learning, and where cognitive\nskills are developed alongside content. The metacognitive model suggests that\nstudents need to develop and use strategies that enable them to monitor their own\nlearning and understanding, and to consider alternative approaches to a task\n(Renshaw, 1995). Team decision-making in the EVS-style lecture requires students\nto justify to the rest of the group their individual choice of answer to the problem\nunder discussion, and to consider alternative answers and justifications from other\ngroup members. Therefore, peer, team and collaborative activity are important\nmetacognitive components of the learning process.\nThrough the EVS-style interactive lectures we wanted to create a social-\nconstructivist learning environment, where communication between all team\nmembers (students and teachers) encourages collaborative learning and peer\nstudent teaching, and where students can develop higher-order cognitive skills. We\nalso wanted to minimise \u2018back row syndrome\u2019, where students deliberately sit at the\nvery back of the lecture room to avoid the need to engage with the lecturer or the\nlecture content. In summary, our study seems to indicate that using EVS-style\ninteractive lectures creates a deep active approach to learning within all four para-\ndigms of learning and teaching.\nConclusions\nEVS-style lectures contain features that promote active learning in lectures to large\ngroups that were consonant with the beliefs of the two lecturers involved. These\ninclude the following: \n\u25cf Learning ought to be based on learning theory that is applied to the large lecture\nsituation.\n\u25cf Students enjoy being active participants in an event that matches learning theory\nwith teaching practice.\n\u25cf Electronic voting is a very effective and efficient method for providing rapid feed-\nback that can be shared with students and their teachers.\n\u25cf Questions posed provide feedback to learners and teachers about the effectiveness\nof lecturer\u2019s teaching and its effect on student learning.\n\u25cf As an aid to instructional technology, EVS is a relatively easy system to master,\nand provides a range of benefits that would be difficult to obtain by other\nmethods.\nThe interactivity in EVS lectures overcame many of the barriers to student learning\nassociated with the large classes taught in the traditional lecture format. The EVS\nlecture opened up new dimensions for exploring effective pedagogy that provides a\nmeans of supporting interactive lectures to large groups of students and to \u2018turn them\non\u2019 to learning. Our findings show that our initial aims and objectives for using EVS\nin lectures were met.\nEVS in lectures within business and marketing 19\nStudents, on the whole, perceive that EVS-style interactive lectures are an improve-\nment on traditional lectures. The quantitative analysis (assessment results) also\nindicates that EVS-style interactive lectures can improve student learning and\nachievement. The identified themes, as well as the student responses to EVS, when\nmapped against different models of learning and teaching, indicate that EVS spans a\nrange of pedagogical approaches. Furthermore, students are not a homogeneous\ngroup in their perceptions about, and responses to, EVS. This may raise issues about\nhow the views of different types of students are managed.\nFinally, this particular innovation led us to review our understanding of learning,\nand to appreciate the value of other paradigms of learning and how they help to\nexplain why students reacted so positively to a transformed learning environment.\nReferences\nAbrahamson, L.
