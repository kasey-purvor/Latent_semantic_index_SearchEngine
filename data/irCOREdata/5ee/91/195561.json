As collectively constructed over the last 15\u201320 years, LA \ndoes not refer to a purely intellectual awareness and is not passive. In the work \ndiscussed above, LA both engenders engagement with language and is constructed \nthrough it. \u2026The engagement can be intellectual, affective, social or political or, usually, \na combination. Researchers are concerned much less with memorized or encyclopaedic \nknowledge than with LA as it encourages, facilitates, discourages or hinders particular \ntypes of engagement with language, be it by language learners, gatekeepers, the general \npublic or other groups. (\u2026 2007, p.302) \n  \nThe problems with such a statement are all too obvious. What does engagement with \nlanguage mean? Do we really need another term? Is it a useful concept, or just a fairly \nempty and ambiguous buzz word? The present paper is an attempt to answer these \nquestions.  \n  The everyday contexts in which the term \u2018engagement\u2019 is used are suggestive: \ncogs engage, armies engage in battle, people get engaged (to be married). It seems to \nsuggest physical or metaphorical close contact, and some force driving things forward \nor pushing in a direction. It is an attractive metaphor, and a popular one in the \nliterature on education (pupil engagement; literacy engagement) and in other areas \nsuch as management (work place engagement). Its meaning is, however, usually \nassumed rather than defined raising the possibility that one writer might not mean the \nsame as another.  \nMy own interest in engagement was triggered by a number of recent publications on   \nlearner variables such as motivation and learning strategies (e.g. Dornyei, 2006; Pavicic \nTakac, 2008) and a similar trend in postgraduate research proposals. Research into \nmotivation attempts to understand what drives engagement, and studies of learning \nstrategies deal with certain forms of engagement; how they can be encouraged and \nwhat their effect might be on learning.  I would argue, therefore, that researchers and \npractitioners alike are currently trying to come to grips with \u2018engagement\u2019 as the place \nwhere learning happens.   \nIn the field of LA, the term \u2018engagement\u2019 is often not defined. Some linguists to whom \n\u2018engagement\u2019 is central, use the term in its everyday sense. For example, Hyland (2003) \nand Batstone (2002) investigate learner engagement, and Borg (2007) looks at \n2 \n \n \nteachers\u2019 research engagement. But the term has recently been used by Storch (2008) \nspecifically to denote instances of noticing as evidenced in language related episodes \n(LREs). Drawing in particular on Leow (1997) and Kuiken and Vedder (2002) who refer \nto \u2018simple and elaborate noticing\u2019 (and also \u2018perfunctory\u2019 and \u2018substantive\u2019 noticing, Qi \nand Lapkin,  2001) she distinguishes between two levels of engagement, limited and \nelaborate. The term \u2018engagement with language\u2019 is thus used by Storch to \u201cdescribe the \nquality of the learners\u2019 metatalk\u201d (2008, p. 99) and is linked to the quality of attention \non which, as Storch (2008) points out, little research has been done. \n It seems an intuitively apt term for what happens in LREs but is potentially a richer \nnotion than this might imply. As a construct, the notion of engagement could provide \nways of explaining why some linguistic or language related behaviours and attitudes \nseem to facilitate language learning and learning about language\/s more than others. I \nwould argue that in addition to its cognitive aspects it crucially involves a range of \nsocial and affective phenomena and that it is this complexity which justifies the \nconstruct.  \nIn order to facilitate a clearer understanding, and make it researchable and able to be \nevaluated as a construct, \u2018engagement with language\u2019 needs detailed interrogation. The \nelements of the construct need to be laid bare, and that is what I will attempt to do below.  \nThe approach has two strands. First a methodology employed by Ellis (2004) to \ninterrogate another notion, \u2018L2 explicit knowledge\u2019 is explained and then applied. The \nfigure below is my summary of the steps he follows. \n For the purposes of this paper, X in figure 1 is \u2018engagement with language\u2019. The first \npart of the analysis and discussion will follow Ellis\u2019s methodology as far as the \nexpanded definition. Having reached a more in depth understanding of the construct, \nthe paper continues with a brief discussion of the relationship between engagement \nand LA. \n \n  \n3 \n \n \n \nWhat is X? \n \nWorking definition. \n \nHow is it different from Y? \n \n               Its key characteristics?         Criteria for identifying it? \n \nExpanded, precise definition. \n \nChoice\/design of measurement instruments. \n \nInterpretation of data. \n  \nFigure 1 Methodology for interrogating and developing a construct (Based on Ellis, 2004) \n \nIn the second part of the paper the various components of the construct will be \napplied to some interview and observation data. This is for illustration only as the data \nwas originally collected for a different purpose. ESOL teachers and their adult students \nwere interviewed and observed in class (\u2026 2005). For the present paper, an analysis of \n\u2018engagement with language\u2019 was carried out on one set of field notes from the \nclassroom observations and one of the interview sessions, with two ESOL students. The \nanalysis leads to suggestions of factors which might encourage or discourage \nengagement with language. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the construct \nand suggestions for ways ahead. \n  \nWhat is \u2018Engagement with Language\u2019 ? \n The working definition from which this investigation starts is as follows: \n \n \n    Working definition of Engagement with Language \n    In the context of language learning and use,  \n   \u2018Engagement with Language\u2019 (Engagement) is a cognitive, and\/or affective and\/or social state and  \n   process in which the learner is the agent and language is object, and may be vehicle  \n  (means of communication).  \n \n \nFor convenience, I will from time to time refer to \u2018engagement with language\u2019 as \nEngagement, and capital E will be used also on the verb (\u2018Engage\u2019 rather than \u2018engage \nwith language\u2019). \n In the definition, I distinguish between when the language is the object of \nEngagement and when it is a vehicle of communication. The term \u2018object\u2018has been \npreferred to other possibilities such as \u2018form\u2019 or \u2018system\u2019 to signal the inclusion of social \nand other non-grammar aspects of language. Likewise, \u2018vehicle\u2019 has been chosen in \npreference to, for example, \u2018use\u2019 as it seems to carry fewer limiting connotations. In the \ndefinition, language being the object is seen as primary, while language as vehicle is a \n4 \n \n \nsecondary and therefore not necessary feature of engagement. The reasons should \nbecome clear in the following discussion. \nAn example of \u2018language as object\u2019 in the classroom would be learners doing \nlanguage exercises or tasks, perhaps discussing solutions in the L1 or target language \n(and thus giving rise to the much studied language related episodes, or LREs). \nCollaborative dialogue (Swain, 2000) or what Swain has later referred to as \u2018languaging\u2019 \n(Swain, 2006) is thus one manifestation of Engagement. A classroom example of \nlanguage as vehicle would be learners doing a communicative task in the target \nlanguage without paying attention to aspects other than communicative efficiency. In \nmany contexts the two aspects of Engagement will both be present. I would argue, \nhowever, that language can also be used without Engagement. Somebody \nspeaking\/writing spontaneously and automatically for purely communicative ends may \nbe socially engaged, but not Engaged with Language. It cannot be assumed therefore \nthat use of language is in and by itself evidence of Engagement in the sense discussed \nhere. Also, Engagement is gradable, i.e. one can be more or less Engaged, and it would \nseem to possess a number of qualities. \n These are implied by the working definition, in the statement that Engagement \ninvolves particular cognitive states, and\/or affective orientations and\/or social \nattitudes, as well as actions and behaviours. In other words, that it should be analyzed \nas both a state and a process. The cognitive, affective and social aspects of Engagement \noverlap, and are likely to affect each other,  but the separation is made to allow a more \nin depth analysis below.  \n  \nHow is engagement different from similar notions? \nThree notions which seem semantically close to Engagement are \u2018involvement\u2019, \n\u2018commitment\u2019 and \u2018motivation\u2019. In the table below, I have attempted to establish to what \nextent and in what way Engagement differs or is similar to its semantic neighbours1.  \n \nTable 1 The relationship of engagement to neighbouring constructs. \n \nComponents\\ Constructs Engagement Involvement Commitment Motivation \nCognitive      \nAlertness \u25cf \u25cf   \nFocused attention \u25cf    \nAction knowledge (making \nknowledge one\u2019s own) \n\u25cf    \n     \nAffective      \nPositive attitude to object \u25cf  \u25cf \u25cf \nPurposeful \u25cf  \u25cf \u25cf \nWillingness\/choice \u25cf  \u25cf \u25cf \nAutonomy \u25cf   \u25cf \n     \nSocial       \nInteraction\/doing \u25cf \u25cf   \nAgency  \u25cf \u25cf   \nLong Term   \u25cf  \nOther oriented   \u25cf \u25cf  \nSelf oriented    \u25cf \n  \n  \n5 \n \n \nThe table represents an attempt to unpack the meanings of \u2018engagement\u2019 and terms \nsemantically close to it, as they are commonly used. Along the horizontal top row, I have \nchosen to compare it with terms which are common currency, like \u2018involvement\u2019, rather \nthan less common notions such as \u2018investment\u2019 (Norton, 1995) on which there may be \nless intuitive agreement (but see comments below). The shaded boxes containing a dot \n(\u25cf) each mark a feature implied by the term at the top of the column. For example, the \ntable makes the claim that the terms \u2018engagement\u2019 and \u2018involvement\u2019 both imply some \nlevel of alertness on the part of the engaged or involved individual.  It does not claim \nthat committed or motivated individuals cannot be alert, only that the terms \n\u2018commitment\u2019 and \u2018motivation\u2019 do not imply anything about alertness. \n  The comparison with\u2019 involvement\u2019, in the table, implies also that while focused \nattention is necessary for engagement, involvement can be unfocused. Likewise, in this \nanalysis only \u2018engagement\u2019 involves a process of taking personal ownership of \nknowledge, turning it into so called \u2018action knowledge\u2019 (Little, 2007, p. 19, discussing \nBarnes, 1976) on which further action can be based. It is posited that \u2018involvement\u2019 is \nnot necessarily affective. The affective dimension is more obviously a component of \n\u2018commitment\u2019 and \u2018motivation\u2019, which are similar to \u2018engagement\u2019 in that they rely on a \npositive attitude and willingness, and are to some degree purposeful.   \n  \u2018Engagement\u2019 and \u2018motivation\u2019, according to my analysis, are similar in that both \nimply a degree of autonomy. Van Lier (2007, p.48) explains autonomy as \u2018the feeling of \nbeing the agent of one\u2019s own actions\u2019 while Little (2007, p.15, citing Holec, 1981) \ndescribes it as \u2018the ability to take charge of one\u2019s own learning\u2019. I have assumed that \nautonomy is an affective disposition and that a motivated or engaged person is \ncharacterized by some degree of autonomy; but that this is not necessarily the case with \na person who is merely involved. \n  The two features unique to \u2018engagement\u2019 in the table above are the cognitive \nfeatures \u2018focused attention\u2019 and \u2018action knowledge\u2019 (making knowledge one\u2019s own). The \npicture emerging is of an individual who is actively constructing their knowledge not \nonly by mental processes but equally by being socially active and taking initiatives. On \nthis analysis, all the nine features marked in the table are implied by the term \n\u2018engagement\u2019. \nIn table 2 below, the key characteristics, or qualities, of the more specific \nconstruct, Engagement (with Language), are identified. Following the working \ndefinition, it is analysed as comprising cognitive, and\/or affective and\/or social states \nand processes.  \n \nTable 2 Key Characteristics of Engagement with Language  \n \n Cognitive Affective Social \n Key \nCharacteristics \nState: Heightened \nalertness; focused \nattention \nProcess: Focused \nreflection and problem \nsolving \nState: Positive orientation \ntowards the language, the \ninterlocutor, and\/or what \nthey represent \nProcess:  Willingness to \ninteract with the language \nand\/or interlocutor is   \nmaintained\/heightened \nState: Behavioural \nreadiness to interact \nProcess: Initiating and \nmaintaining interaction.* \n \nNote.  *Maintenance may involve not only keeping interaction going but also caring for the quality of \ninteraction. \n6 \n \n \n \nThe characteristics are only meaningful if they can be operationalized \u2013 the \u2018how can \nit be identified\u2019 step in the fig. 1 model. The following table is an attempt to indicate \nhow it could be done. In the table below, L stands for \u2018learner\u2019 but would not necessarily \nbe a learner in the formal sense. L could be any individual potentially engaging with \nlanguage. The table suggests for each kind of Engagement some questions which could \nbe asked in order to establish its degree and qualities. A person might, for example, be \ncognitively but not socially Engaged, or Engaged to different degrees in different \nspheres. \n  \nTable 3 Criteria for Identifying Engagement with Language \n \nCognitive Affective Social \nHow alert? (Does L seem \nenergetic or lethargic? \nDoes L seem to notice \nlanguage\/interaction \nfeatures?) \nHow focused?  Is L\u2019s attention on the language (as object or medium) or not? \n(Does L\u2019s mind seem to \nwander?) \nHow reflective?; \nHow critical\/analytical? Is L\u2019s reasoning inductive or memory\/imitation based? Does L notice and reflect, or simply react? \n(Does L compare? Does L \nask questions? Does L \ninfer\/ draw conclusions?) \nHow willing to engage?  (Is \nL withdrawn or eager to \nparticipate?) \nHow purposeful?   \n(Does L seem to be \u2018going \nsomewhere\u2019 or just \ncoasting?) \nHow autonomous? \n(Is L\u2019s behaviour \ndependent or \nindependent?) \n \nHow interactive  \n(Verbal and other \nbehaviours? Does L use \ninteraction for \nlearning?) \nHow supportive? \n(Verbal and other \nbehaviours? Does L \nengage in negotiation \nand scaffolding? ) \nLeader or follower? \n(Are L\u2019s interactions \nreactive or initiating?) \n \nThe posited characteristics of Engagement and their operationalization (Tables 2 and 3) \nmay not be exhaustive, but they offer a principled and manageable framework for the \ninterrogation and analysis of the level of engagement, and the identification of the \ncharacteristics of that engagement. They can be said to validate the earlier semantic \nunpacking and comparison (Table 1) to the extent that there are clear links between \nthem.  For example, Table 1 suggests that a cognitively Engaged person is alert, pays \nfocused attention and constructs their own knowledge. Table 3 operationalizes that by \nasking questions around how alert, focused, reflective and critical\/analytical the person \nis. Affective and social Engagement are operationalized in similar ways.   \n \nAn expanded, more precise definition can now be attempted. \n  \n  \nExpanded definition of Engagement with Language \nIn the context of language learning and use,  \nEngagement with Language (Engagement) is a cognitive, and\/or affective, and\/or social state and  \nprocess in which the learner is the agent and language is object (and sometimes vehicle).  \n Cognitively, the Engaged individual is alert, pays focused attention and constructs their own \nknowledge. \n Affectively, the Engaged individual has a positive, purposeful, willing and autonomous \ndisposition towards the object (language, the language and\/ \nor what it represents) \n Socially, the Engaged individual is interactive and initiating. \n \n7 \n \n \nThe definition is not meant to be \u2018the last word\u2019 on the subject. Instead, it raises a \nnumber of questions and needs to be further refined by being debated and challenged. \nFor example, in terms of determining when Engagement is or is not present, are some \nfeatures of Engagement necessary while others are optional? For example, is \nEngagement always cognitive to some degree, but not necessarily affective and\/or \nsocial? Is it possible to be socially Engaged without the presence of some interactivity? \nIf Engagement is a matter of degree, how does one establish a minimum level of \nEngagement? I have assumed above that from a learning point of view, Engagement \nmatters. If so, are all kinds of Engagement equally effective? One purpose of the above \nanalysis, is to make such questions researchable. A final question, to which I will return \nbelow, is whether this specification of the construct can help establish factors which \nfacilitate or hinder Engagement with Language.  \n  \nEngagement with Language and Language Awareness \nHaving determined what Engagement means, and acknowledging that this is a work \nin progress, the purpose of the remainder of this paper is to try and determine how \nuseful (or otherwise) the construct might be to LA, and where it might be taken in \nfuture LA research.  \n LA can be considered from two different angles in relation to Engagement: as the \nlikely outcome of Engagement with Language, and as a resource which feeds \nEngagement. LA is most obviously the outcome of Engagement when language is the \nobject. The degree to which language as vehicle contributes to LA may depend on the \nuser\u2019s analytical skills and what other demands there are on their attentional resources. \nThe figure below attempts to illustrate these relationships.  \n  \n \n Figure 2 The Engagement with Language \u2013 Language Awareness Cycle \n \nAccording to this figure, once some LA has been acquired it is a resource which can \nbe drawn on when Engaging with Language, either as object and vehicle, or as object \nonly. Such Engagement is likely to enhance or add to the person\u2019s LA, and thus to create \na richer store of LA for further Engagement and knowledge creation. The model in fig.2 \nimplies that LA research and practice are intimately and crucially concerned with the \ncharacteristics and qualities of Engagement with Language. A particularly interesting \narea of investigation might be how this cycle is affected by multilingualism (cf. Singleton \nand Aronin, 2007). The model would need to be tested in empirical (or experimental) \n[LA as Outcome]\nLANGUAGE \nAWARENESS\n[LA as Resource]\n[Language as Object]\nENGAGEMENT\n[Language as Vehicle]\n8 \n \n \nresearch, but this is beyond the scope of the present paper. Below I will only try to \nillustrate with some sample data how the construct might help us understand some of \nwhat happens in language classrooms.  \n \n  \nSome ESOL learners\u2019 Engagement with Language \nThe above criteria for identifying Engagement (Table 3) indicate the need for micro \nanalysis of conversation data or audio\/video recording of classroom interaction but for \nthe purposes of this paper I have, as previously indicated, merely reanalyzed some \nalready available data. Three adult ESOL student groups were observed by two researchers \ntaking field notes, in 12 class sessions of about 50 minutes each. Subsequently, eight of the \nESOL students  and the four ESOL class teachers were interviewed.  The focus of the \nobservations was on how the teachers managed grammar instruction and on the learners' \nengagement. The interviews explored attitudes to the teaching methods and materials, and \nrationales for such perceptions. Below I will discuss some illustrative extracts from the \nobservation field notes, and from a transcript of one 30 minute pair interview with \nESOL students from the same class as in the observation extract2.  I believe the data \nsheds some light on the role of Engagement in the creation and use of LA (LA as \noutcome and resource). The section concludes with suggestions for factors which might \nfacilitate or hinder Engagement.  \n  \nCognitive Engagement \nI have taken it as given that the development of LA, and the learning of a language\/ \nlanguages, normally relies on a combination of cognitive, affective and social factors. \nBelow I will attempt to be more specific by isolating instances of the three aspects of \nEngagement referred to above. While this separation is somewhat artificial (there are \nclearly strong interrelationships) I believe it can help provide a rich analysis. \nIn creating classroom conditions which are conducive to cognitive Engagement with \nLanguage, the teacher has a key role.  In the sample observation the teacher kept her \nvoice at a fairly low pitch and low volume. This could be calming and help students \nconcentrate, though a livelier voice could help some stay alert. When she was \nmonitoring students\u2019 work, the teacher often kneeled down to reach eye level with the \nseated students, as in the example extract below. Creating a degree of social intimacy in \nthis way, might facilitate focused attention. \n  \nExtract 1 (Observation) - Creating the conditions for cognitive Engagement: \nS1 and S7 discuss alternatives with T (newer\/ more new) in private conference.  \nT encourages SS to put the adjectives in sentences. \nT reads some and laughs with SS. S tries out an example structure on the T. \nDiscussion ensues one-to-one [T and S]. \n  \nIn the field notes, numbers were assigned to the students in the order they entered \nthe classroom. In the extract, \u2018T\u2019 is the teacher; \u2018S\u2019 indicates a single student, \u2018SS\u2019 two or \nmore students. Above, student 1 and student 7 were working together. In this episode \nthe students had been given an exercise to do in pairs on using the comparative of \nadjectives. They were discussing which form of \u2018new\u2019 to use. The interaction was not \ntape recorded but parts of it could be overheard.    \n9 \n \n \nThese hushed discussions between a student or students and the teacher were quite \nfrequent. The teacher rarely provided solutions but favoured guided discovery, which \nencouraged focused attention on the students\u2019 part, though this might have been for \nbrief spells only. Also, it was difficult to tell whether in replying to the questions \nstudents drew inferences or relied on memory. The former would, presumably, require \na higher degree of cognitive Engagement than the latter.   \n As adults come with an educational history, often including more than one language, \nit is not surprising that many have a fair degree of LA, including declarative grammar \nknowledge. This is evident in the following interview extract. (Student names are \npseudonyms;  \u2018I\u2019 is the interviewer.): \n \nExtract 2 (Interview) - LA facilitating Engagement in the form of noticing and  \nreflection: \nI:  What do you think about the grammar teaching? \nMax:  Seems very useful because, I think that just a simple grammar is not enough \nbecause if I want to read a newspaper, sometimes there is not just a simple \nsentence, will and write a lot of clause or compound, complex so I want to try \nout, to really take the maybe the subject and the object and which one is \nadjective which one is something, it\u2019s very complicated I think. But I think the \ngrammar is the most important tool. More understand a lot of different piece of \nwriting.  \nI:  So would you like more, or do you think it\u2019s enough as it is? \nMax:  For me, I want more. In the writing, I can\u2019t just write a subject verb object and \nnothing else. \nMax was acutely aware that he did not have the grammar needed to express the \nmeanings he wanted. He noticed the complexity in the input which he had chosen as his \ntarget model, i.e. newspaper text. The impression is that his declarative grammar \nknowledge has facilitated Engagement in the form of noticing and reflection. The \nfrustration at not having sufficient resources could be either discouraging or \nmotivating. In Max\u2019s case, the impression was that this affective dimension intensified \nhis cognitive Engagement with English. \nWhen Max was asked if he wanted to have his mistakes corrected by the teacher, he \nindicated that corrections helped him notice: \nExtract 3 (Interview) - Correction facilitating cognitive Engagement: \nMax:  I think it is very important because if something written is wrong then tutor \ncorrect for me, then I will notice \u2018oh this is wrong\u2019, so next time I will notice and I \nthink I will guess and improve {\u2026} about this.  \n  \nAffective Engagement \nIn the analysis above, it was said that affective Engagement could be operationalized \nas degree of willingness, purposefulness and autonomy.  The good humoured mood in \nthe lesson - partly due to the teacher\u2019s approach, described above - contributed to the \nimpression of willingness. Sporadically, there was low key laughter in the class. A \nparticular episode stands out. In the extract below, the students are doing a listening \ncomprehension exercise which involves matching pictures and questions with what \nthey hear. The teaching points are comparative adjectives and use of \u2018all\u2019 and \u2018both\u2019.  \nThe driver of the learners\u2019 Engagement is probably enjoyment of the competitive task. \n10 \n \n \nExtract 4 (Observation) -  Affective Engagement\/ willingness:  \nTape: T says what [the tape] contains. (One conversation around each picture; SS \npick out the question on the work sheet.) \n SS appear to enjoy their \u2018successes\u2019. There is quiet laughter and silent victory \nsigns. \n  \nThe students appeared to enter into the spirit of the task, making it a game. They \nwere engaging willingly and deriving some pleasure from their achievements.  The \ncompetitive element (perhaps not intended by the teacher) seemed to contribute to \nboth affective and cognitive Engagement.  \nAlong with the teacher\u2019s approach and the task design, the topic and type of text may \nhave an effect on learners\u2019 willingness to Engage. In the sample interview, Max (below) \nappeared particularly keen to read and listen to factual texts such as newspapers and \nnews reports. The learner worked purposefully on expanding his vocabulary. The \ndriver seems to have been the intrinsic interest of topics and texts used in the \nclassroom (and also available outside). \n \nExtract 5 (Interview) -  Affective\/ Purposeful Engagement: \nI:  And is that what you enjoy most, learning to read and write or? \nMax:  Yes, to read what happened in this world. Because from just a couple of weeks \nago we study a lot class this afternoon \u2013 it\u2019s about Britain and the world. It is \nvery interesting. It encouraged me to, more hardworking to study English to try \nunderstand more and build up more vocabulary.  \nI:  So do you like learning about the country? \nMax:  Yes. \nI:  The history and so on? You enjoy that. \nMax:  Yes. \nThe intrinsic interest of the material used in class spurred Max on to engage, \nparticularly with the vocabulary.  \nThe other student interviewee, Jenny, seemed to have a positive orientation towards \nthe target language and what it represented. The following utterance follows \nimmediately after the previous one. The driver here seems to be Jenny\u2019s self-perception.  \nExtract 6 (Interview) - Affective Engagement\/Willingness: \nJenny: I proud when I can speak English.  \nLearning the language is clearly more to this student than a practical necessity. \nNevertheless, meeting objective needs and feeling motivated and satisfied go hand in \nhand. To a question about what they thought of the course content, the same student \nreplied: \nExtract 7 (Interview) - Affective\/ Purposeful Engagement: \nJenny: Content? Could you explain please? \nI:  What they teach you. The things they teach you here, do you think that is what \nyou need? Or what you want? Or do you need something else? \nJenny: You thought about the teacher teaching or me? \nI:  Yes, the school. What they have decided to teach you. \nJenny: Oh yes. I need here teaching speaking, some class for reading and writing, I think \nit\u2019s good. Because especially [name] {\u2026} bring some thing - object for class and \n11 \n \n \ntalking about that \u2013 operation, for hospital, for surgery, for telephone. This is, for \nme it is really interesting. I enjoy about that. Understand what\u2019s {\u2026} or what is \u2013 \nbecause sometimes I don\u2019t understand the telephone. It is very quickly to me {\u2026} \nbut when she bring for us, and after that understand better. I can speak with \nsomebody and {\u2026} \nThe immediate relevance of the language being taught provided Jenny with a purpose \nfor Engaging with it. Though other types of data would be needed to know the depth of \nthe Engagement process, the extract shows that the student\u2019s own difficulties with \ntelephone conversations made her keen to participate in classroom activities on this \ntopic, which for her were obviously purposeful.  \nThe sense of relevance and purpose made the two students Engage with the language \nnot only in the classroom, but also independently at home: \nExtract 8 (Interview) - Affective Engagement\/ Autonomy: \nI:  So, you like the worksheets? To take home. \nJenny: Yes, yes, I can do it. \nMax:  Excuse me. Another, is not an activity, it\u2019s very useful is role-play.  \nI:  Role play is useful? Yeah. Do you remember something you like especially? Can \nyou give examples? \nJenny: Something like that? Example? About listening, with the tape. Before I couldn\u2019t \nunderstand nothing. But it\u2019s better. Very better. Because all the time teacher try \nfor me, and I try at home, TV and radio. It\u2019s better than before, very better.  \nI:  You are improving all the time.  \nJenny: Very important.  \nFor most ESOL students, the English language is key to a more secure and possibly \nmore fulfilling future and so it is not surprising to find that some are highly self-\nmotivated and try to further their learning in a number of ways.  It was often evident in \nboth the interview and observation that Engagement was the learner\u2019s choice. Max even \ntook the opportunity to follow additional courses: \n \nExtract 9 (Interview) - Affective Engagement\/ Autonomy: \nI:  \u2026What do you think \u2013 how much do you learn from your teacher, your \nclassmates or by yourself? \nMax:  I think the half from the teacher, after, for example, if I\u2019ve got time I back to \nhome, I will do some revision from the tutor then try to find out more, encourage \nmore to read, so maybe it is half by myself. But the tutor always give the opinion, \nlike if I watch TV, subtitle only, I try to find maybe just a few vocabulary  I can\u2019t \nunderstand, I look up my dictionary, and next time I will remember, then I know \nhow to use it.  \n\u2026 \nMax:  \u2026 And last Thursday I did how to improve communication skills, and this \nThursday and Friday I want to try time management. Try to improve my English \nthen maybe in the future I am going to the {name} College doing the EFF, EFL \ncourse.  \n  \n12 \n \n \n  \nSocial Engagement \nIn the previous analysis (tables 2 and 3 above), social Engagement was essentially \nlinked to interaction and to learners\u2019 initiation and maintenance (or not) of it.  Some of \nthe extracts already discussed in terms of affective Engagement could also be analyzed \nfrom the social point of view. Below, I will however examine evidence of social \nEngagement in other parts of the interview data.  \n Key questions are firstly with whom the language learners\/users need, want and are \nlikely to interact and in what contexts. The students in the sample interview mentioned \ninteraction in medical and shopping contexts; and with neighbours; job interviews; \nreading government documents, including solicitors\u2019 letters; and (as above) \nunderstanding people on the telephone.  \n Max cared particularly about the quality of his interaction outside the classroom and \nwas aware of the importance of appropriate language.  \n \nExtract 10 (Interview) - Social Engagement \u2013 Maintaining interaction: \nMax:  Yes, definitely. Because sometimes English is very is very difficult for me, \nbecause it is, like speaking a formal and an informal, I should and I must \nunderstand which way is formal and which way is informal and which which \nplace I can use these, and\u2026. \n  \nNot mastering colloquial varieties could make social interaction difficult for example in \nthe work place or with neighbours. Another challenge mentioned was the natural speed \nof delivery which can make understanding difficult (Flowerdew and Miller, 1996; \nGraham, 2006), particularly in telephone conversations. There are many situations \noutside the classroom where there is a lack of thinking time. In the job interview, there \nis added pressure on the interviewee because of the power held by the interviewer.   \n In contrast, features of classroom interaction with potential to encourage and \nfacilitate Engagement are the availability of thinking time, and the more egalitarian \nrelationships between interlocutors (cf. Batstone, 2002). Individual learner variables \nnevertheless intervene. Max is keen to use peer interaction as a means of learning. \n \nExtract 11 (Interview) - Social Engagement\/ Readiness to interact:  \nI:  \u2026 What do you think of working in pairs and groups in the class? \nMax:  It\u2019s a good way to communicate. First you can get a communication with another \nclassmate, and you can not sure, just express maybe after then you get \nsomething, like you can use each other, try to find out from the talking. \nJenny: Practice for talking and mainly practice for talking, practice for listening, \naccents, {\u2026} very difficult. {..} English people, another {\u2026}, young people, \nsomething is different, yeah {..} is happy to {\u2026} the accent.  \n \n\u2018You can use each other, try to find out from the talking\u2019 encapsulates the notion of \n\u2018languaging\u2019 (Swain, 2006), a social manifestation of Engagement which Max finds \nhelpful.  \nJenny is less able to Engage in the framework of peer interaction, apparently because \nof differences in language proficiency (a power differential) and prefers the teacher\u2019s \nexpert scaffolding. \n13 \n \n \nExtract 12 (Interview) - Social Engagement\/ Readiness to interact: \nI:  Ok. So you think that pair and group work help you with this? Would you like to \ndo more group and pair work or less, or what do you think? \nJenny: In the middle, a little bit {\u2026} the teacher told is better, but yes this one practice is \nbetter, not too bad. Not a long time, because together I haven\u2019t a lot talking, just a \nlittle talk is finished. Me, I don\u2019t understand lots of, just a little talking. But with \nteacher help me I can speak longer. \nAs the two extracts show, Max is the more proficient of the pair of interviewees. He \nappreciates the opportunity to try things out with peers. For Jenny, both speaking and \nunderstanding in a group of more proficient students are very demanding. She needs \nthe teacher to scaffold her. Despite the more accommodating nature of a classroom (as \ncompared to external settings), it can apparently not be taken for granted that peer \ninteraction will favour Engagement - in particular in mixed ability groups.  \n It was clear that the students\u2019 desire to be able to interact with a range of people in a \nvariety of situations was not just for practical expediency. Max (below) wished to be \nregarded as a good neighbour. He sees himself acting as member of a community where \nTL is a vehicle and is aware of the effect misunderstandings might have on his \nrelationships with neighbours and cares about the quality of interaction. \nExtract 13 (Interview) - Social Engagement\/ Maintaining interaction: \nMax:  Because for me I think by living in this country for ever I should understand \nlanguage {\u2026} I should use the language to communicate with the foreign people \nand I should understand a lot of piece of writing like government or official {\u2026} \nlike recycling or something. I live in the area - I didn\u2019t until now think my \nneighbours will say \u201cthis is foreigner, not good\u201d.  \n  \nMax is anxious not to create a negative impression among his neighbours, for example \nby not being able to understand the rules for recycling household rubbish. Reading \ncomprehension thus becomes especially important, but communicating with \u2018the \nforeign people\u2019 is also important (\u2018foreign\u2019 here probably means in relation to him).  \n The language proficiency of adult ESOL students has an impact not only on the \nindividual, but also on their families. Obvious needs are for example to find and keep \njobs, but Jenny (below) had a less obvious need. She was concerned that she did not \nknow English well enough to be able to help her son, probably with school work. In the \nextract below, Jenny presents herself as part of a family. She has a need to Engage (with \nEnglish) in interaction with her child; this is thus interaction for teaching rather than \nlearning. (On an affective level, it seems to also provide a purpose for Jenny\u2019s \nEngagement in the classroom.)   \n \nExtract 14 (Interview) - Social Engagement\/ Readiness to interact: \nJenny: Grammar until now it\u2019s ok. I think I need a little better understand. Not just for \nbecause I have child, sometimes I need help my child. If I understand a lot, I can \nhelp my child with the {\u2026}. But at the moment, I think for can speak is learn, \nteach to us as well is ok. But I need, I think, I need understand more than because \nsometimes I am in charge for my child because {\u2026} difficult sometimes for my \nchild very difficult and he needs\u2026 \nI:  And, do they teach you grammar sometimes? \nJenny: With my son? \nI:  No, here? The teachers? \n14 \n \n \nJenny: Yes. But for me it\u2019s enough, I think. But I think I need much more about \nsometimes I can help my child. \n  \nJenny may be trying to say that while the grammar she gets in class is sufficient to \ndevelop her own proficiency, she needs more declarative knowledge about English \ngrammar in order to help her son. This is quite possibly a strong driver of her \nEngagement with grammar learning activities in class. Further on in the interview, \nJenny also suggested that if she had had more than one child at school, this would have \ngiven her opportunity to practice English at home, her assumption being that the \nchildren would naturally prefer to speak English to each other.  Hence, the presence of \nschool age children in the immediate or extended family might encourage and facilitate \nEngagement with the language by older family members both in a classroom setting \nand at home. \n The sample data were not designed to address the effect differences in gender, \nlanguage, cultural and educational background might have on Engagement with \nLanguage in ESOL classrooms.  A related issue is the link between identity and \nEngagement. Richards (2006, p.63 discussing classroom conversation data from Willis \n1992) provides a striking example of how a teacher dismisses and effectively stops a \nlearner\u2019s attempt to introduce a facet of their identity which is clearly essential to the \nlearner. It could be useful to understand better what effect such incidents might have on \nthe learner\u2019s Engagement.  \n \nFacilitating or Impeding Engagement \nReturning to the quote at the start of the paper, I have claimed that LA researchers \nand practitioners are concerned with \u201cLA as it encourages, facilitates, discourages or \nhinders particular types of engagement with language\u201d (\u2026: 302).  Table 4 represents a \nfirst attempt to identify factors which do so. The qualities which would be affected have \nbeen repeated first (from table 2) for convenience. Factors which might influence \npresence or degree of Engagement positively are called \u2018drivers\u2019, and the negative \nfactors, \u2018spanners\u2019.  \n It is clear in Table 4 that cognitive, social and affective factors encroach on each \nother; cognitive Engagement can arguably be affected by emotional state, for example. \nSimilar overlaps can be detected in regard to affective or social Engagement. For \nexample, social interactive processes can be affected by perceived power differentials, \nwhich are also likely to influence affective factors such as trust. But for the purpose of \nanalysis it seems useful to separate drivers and spanners of the three types of \nEngagement outcomes. \n  \n15 \n \n \n \nTable 4 Engagement Drivers and Spanners  \n \n Cognitive Affective Social \n \nKey \nCharacteristics \nState: Heightened \nalertness; focused \nattention \nProcess: Focused \nreflection and problem \nsolving \nState: Positive orientation \ntowards the language, the \ninterlocutor, and\/or what \nthey represent \nProcess:  Willingness to \ninteract with the language \nand\/or interlocutor is \nmaintained\/heightened \nState: Behavioural \nreadiness to interact \nProcess: Initiating and \nresponding positively to \ninteraction. \n \nDrivers and \nSpanners \nEnergy levels (time of \nday, state of health, low \nadrenaline etc.) \nImmediate \nsurroundings (noise, \nlighting, temperature, \nmovement, colours);  \nEmotional state (stress, \nworries; serenity) \nTraining (educational \nbackground; culture of \nlearning prior \nknowledge) \nTask\/activity design \n(task demands within \nZPD, match with \nlearning style) \nTeaching approach; \nTeacher behaviour \nPersonality type \n(extrovert\/introvert);  \nL self- perception (of own \nknowledge and ability; self-\nconfidence;  );  \nTrust (how well do Ls \nknow\/like each other?);  \nTopic (interesting, \noffensive, relevant \ntopic\/content) \nClarity of procedure and \npurpose (how and why \nshould the task\/activity be \ndone?);  \nIntrinsically motivating \nquality of task\/activity (e.g. \nRelevance of purpose; right \nlevel of intellectual \nchallenge; expected \nsuccess; competitive \nelement; opportunity to \nengage in identity \nconstruction) \nPower differentials \n(equal\/different status; \ngate keeper \u2013dependant; \nequal\/different language \nproficiency; language \n[variety] status) \nGender \n(same\/different \nsocialization; cultural\/ \nreligious restrictions) \nSocial\/Cultural belonging \n (shared\/different values, \nschemata) \nSocial Networks   \n Family; friends; \ncolleagues; neighbours \n \n  \n Conclusion \nThis paper was prompted by the perception that for researchers and teachers \n(including postgraduate students), Engagement was a central notion.  I have tried to \nshow how Engagement can be defined and operationalized, and how it relates to LA: I \nhave argued that LA can be simultaneously a result of and a resource for Engagement. \nThe analysis attempts to provide a principled way of establishing, measuring and \ninterpreting the presence\/absence, degree and nature of Engagement. To the extent \nthat this has succeeded, it should help make Engagement researchable. The discussion \nof the sample data shows, in my view, some of its potential to provide rich descriptions \nand analyses of complex environments such as the language classroom.  \nEngagement is clearly related to, but different from a number of other notions in the \nresearch literature. As defined here, it attempts to address what is, or is not, going on in \nthe learning process. Other constructs, such as motivation (Gardner, 1985; D\u00f6rnyei, \n2003) and investment (Norton, 1995) seem to deal more with the question \u2018why\u2019, which \nhas only very briefly been addressed in the section on \u2018drivers\u2019 and \u2018spanners\u2019. Other \nnotions, such as agency (Ahern, 2001; Swain, 2006), and autonomy (Holec, 1981; Little, \n16 \n \n \n2007), it has been claimed, are incorporated in Engagement. \u2018Languaging\u2019 (Swain, \n2006), finally, was said to be one observable manifestation of Engagement. It is up to \nthe reader to decide whether this makes Engagement too all-encompassing to be useful, \nor if it may be a useful construct precisely because it brings together, in a principled \nway, a variety of aspects of a highly complex environment (notably the language \nclassroom, e.g. Larsen-Freeman, 1997).  \nSeveral research avenues are possible. Systematic testing of sub-components of the \nEngagement construct could be as valuable as holistic research incorporating cognitive, \naffective and social aspects of Engagement. Questions which might be investigated \nwithin an Engagement framework include under what conditions it produces useful LA \noutcomes. For example, memorized grammar rules (a kind of LA) may be of limited use \nto the learner. Could this be to do partly with the kinds of Engagement typically \nrequired for memorization? What qualities, or combinations of qualities, should \nlearners\u2019 Engagement have in order to produce learning?3 Research on different \ncognitive, affective and social aspects of Engagement might eventually be synthesized. \nFollowing Ellis\u2019s (2004) methodology (Figure 1 above) it is hoped that for any \nresearcher wishing to conduct research on Engagement, the model presented above \nmight help inform the choice of research design and measurement instruments, as well \nas the approach to data analysis, and that it will also stimulate a critical debate on \nrelated issues. \n \n Notes \n1. I am indebted to many of my doctoral students who have discussed this with me and helped me get \nto this stage of analysis.  My initial set of features was somewhat modified on the basis of their input. \nThe The research objective was thus to match the aspirations of the NAECC in regard to the \nteaching of grammar against actual classroom practice and dynamics.   \n2. data was collected for, and discussed in, \u2026 (2005) and is used here with the kind permission of my \nco-researcher. \n3.
