Introduction\nIn contrast with all-sky X-ray surveys which typically\nprovide relatively shallow coverage, serendipitous surveys\nprovide much deeper observations, albeit restricted to\nsmaller sky areas. Serendipitous X-ray sky surveys, tak-\ning advantage of the relatively wide \feld of view a\u000borded\nby typical X-ray instrumentation, have been pursued\nSend o\u000bprint requests to: M. G. Watson\n? Based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an\nESA science mission with instruments and contributions di-\nrectly funded by ESA Member States and the USA (NASA).\nwith most X-ray astronomy satellites since the Einstein\nObservatory. The resultant serendipitous source cata-\nlogues (e.g. EMSS [835 sources] Gioia et al. 1990, Stocke\net al. 1991; WGACAT [\u001862 000 unique sources] White\net al. 1994; ROSAT 2RXP & ROSAT 1RXH [\u001895 000\n& \u001811 000 sources respectively] the ROSAT Consortium,\n2000) have been the basis for numerous studies and have\nmade a signi\fcant contribution to our knowledge of the\nX-ray sky and our understanding of the nature of the var-\nious Galactic and extragalactic source populations.\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.aanda.org or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20000067\nL52 M.

Top row shows the soft\nband (0.5{2 keV) images and the bottom row the corresponding hard band (2{10 keV) images. Left: Mkn 205, EPIC pn image;\nCentre: OY Car, EPIC MOS1+MOS2 image; Right: G21.5\u22120.9 (o\u000bset pointing), EPIC pn image. Further details are given in\nTable 1. The images have been smoothed to aid the visibility of faint sources. The trails associated with bright sources in the\npn images are due to \u2018out-of-time\u2019 events which arrive during the read-out cycle of the CCDs and have not been screened out\nThe XMM-Newton Observatory (Jansen et al. 2001),\nlaunched in December 1999, provides unrivaled capabil-\nities for serendipitous X-ray surveys by virtue of the\nlarge \feld of view of the X-ray telescopes with the EPIC\nX-ray cameras (Turner et al. 2001; Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001),\nand the high throughput a\u000borded by the heavily nested\ntelescope modules. This capability guarantees that each\nXMM-Newton observation provides a signi\fcant harvest\nof serendipitous X-ray sources in addition to data on\nthe original target. This potential is now starting to be\nrealised, as is described below.\n2. The role of the XMM-Newton Survey Science\nCentre (SSC)\nIn recognition of the importance of the XMM-Newton\nserendipitous science ESA solicited proposals for an\nXMM-Newton Survey Scientist in 1995. The role of the\nSurvey Scientist centres on providing a coordinated ap-\nproach to XMM-Newton serendipitous data to ensure that\nthe whole scienti\fc community can exploit this valuable\nresource. In fact the role of the Survey Scientist required\nby ESA was much wider than this, involving the substan-\ntial additional tasks of making a major contribution to the\ndevelopment of the scienti\fc processing and analysis soft-\nware for XMM-Newton, the routine \\pipeline\" processing\nof all the observations and the compilation of the XMM-\nNewton Serendipitous Source Catalogue.\nThe XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre (SSC) con-\nsortium was selected by ESA in early 1996. The SSC is\nan international collaboration involving a consortium of\n8 institutions in the UK, France and Germany, together\nwith 7 Associate Scientists. The SSC\u2019s role in facilitat-\ning the exploitation of the XMM-Newton serendipitous\nsurvey is the main subject of this paper, but here we\nemphasise the other contributions that the SSC is mak-\ning to the project. Since 1996 the SSC has been work-\ning closely with ESA\u2019s Science Operations Centre (SOC)\nsta\u000b in the development of the scienti\fc analysis software\nrequired for the XMM-Newton project. This is the soft-\nware that both carries out the initial pre-processing of\nthe XMM-Newton scienti\fc data and permits the detailed\nM. G. Watson et al.: The XMM-Newton Serendipitous Survey. I. L53\nscienti\fc analysis of the observations: the modules can be\nused in a \fxed con\fguration for the routine processing\nof the XMM-Newton data, and can be used in an inter-\nactive con\fguration by XMM-Newton observers to carry\nout custom analysis of their data. For documentation of\nthe XMM-Newton science analysis software, a collection of\nsoftware tools now known as the XMM-Newton \\SAS\", see\nhttp:\/\/xmm.vilspa.esa.es\/sas\/. At the time of writing\nversion 5.0 of the SAS is undergoing \fnal testing with a\nplanned full public release of the system before the end of\n2000.\nIn parallel with the software developments, the SSC\nhas developed the infrastructure required to carry out, on\nbehalf of ESA, the routine \\pipeline\" processing of all the\nXMM-Newton observations from each of the three instru-\nments. The aim here is to provide a set of data products\nwhich will be of immediate value for the XMM-Newton ob-\nserver as well as for the science archive where they will also\nbe stored for eventual public release. The XMM-Newton\ndata products include calibrated, \\cleaned\" event lists\nwhich are intended to provide the starting point for most\ninteractive analysis of the data as well as a number of sec-\nondary high-level products such as sky images, source lists,\ncross-correlations with archival catalogues, source spectra\nand time series. These provide a useful overview of the\nobservation for the XMM-Newton observer as well as con-\nstituting key archival resources and the starting point for\nthe compilation of the Serendipitous Source Catalogue.\nThe XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue\nwill be based on the EPIC source lists1 from the pipe-line\nprocessing, but will also contain comprehensive archival\ncatalogue data, and results from the SSC (and other)\nfollow-up programme(s) described below. The SSC will\nemphasize the reliability, uniformity and usability of the\ncatalogue paying particular attention to the external cata-\nlogue correlations and identi\fcation information. The pro-\nvision of ancillary information such as sky-coverage and\nsensitivity estimates is planned to ensure the scienti\fc\nusefulness of the catalogue.\n3. Performance of XMM-Newton\nfor serendipitous surveys\nObservations obtained in the early phases of the XMM-\nNewton observing programme have been analysed by the\nproject teams in order to establish the in-orbit perfor-\nmance of the Observatory and its instrumentation. Here\nwe concentrate on those aspects of the XMM-Newton per-\nformance which are important for serendipitous surveys.\n3.1. Field of view and image quality\nThe \feld of view of the XMM-Newton X-ray telescopes\nhas a radius of \u001915 arcmin beyond which ba\u000fes reduce\nthe out-of-\feld response to very low levels. The X-ray tele-\nscope \feld of view is completely covered by the EPIC MOS\n1 OM results will also be incorporated.\nFig. 2. Residual position di\u000berences between X-ray source po-\nsitions and potential optical counterparts extracted from deep\ni0 CCD images obtained with the INT WFC (see Sect. 5). The\nsolid histogram shows the distribution for counterparts with a\nhigh likelihood of being the correct identi\fcation. The dashed\nhistogram shows the distribution for all potential candidates.\nThe red curves show the Gaussian \fts to the solid histogram\ndata points\nand pn X-ray cameras out to a radius of \u001914 arcmin. The\non-axis point spread functions (PSFs) of the X-ray tele-\nscopes, con\frmed by in-orbit data (Jansen et al. 2001),\nhave FWHM values 5{7 arcsec and HEW values \u001814{\n15 arcsec. The optical design of the X-ray telescopes pro-\nduces a PSF which shows only a very slow degradation\nout to a radius of \u001810 arcmin (Jansen et al. 2001). With\nappropriate on-board and ground processing (as incorpo-\nrated into the SAS) to remove hot pixels and noise e\u000bects,\nthe EPIC X-ray images are remarkably free from defects\nwith the most noticeable features being the inter-chip gaps\nin the EPIC pn and EPIC MOS cameras. Figure 1 shows\nexample EPIC images which illustrate these points.\n3.2. Positional accuracy for EPIC source detections\nThe accuracy with which EPIC source detections can be\nmeasured depends on the accuracy with which the EPIC\ncamera coordinate system can be related to the celestial\nastrometric reference frame and the statistical accuracy of\nthe individual position determinations in the camera co-\nordinate system. The transformation between the EPIC\ncamera coordinate system and sky coordinates provided\nby the XMM-Newton aspect system has a typical accu-\nracy of \u00184 arcsec. To improve on this, cross-correlation of\nEPIC X-ray sources with catalogued optical objects (e.g.\nthe USNO A2.0 catalogue) will be used routinely in the\nprocessing pipeline to provide an updated transformation\nbetween the EPIC and sky frames with an expected ac-\ncuracy of \u0014 1 arcsec across the whole EPIC \feld. Using\nthis approach, the EPIC source positions, even for faint\nsources close to the detection limit, have typical 90% con-\n\fdence radii of only \u00192{5 arcsec, limited by statistical\naccuracy of the measurements. An illustration of the po-\nsitional accuracy already achieved is given in Fig. 2 which\nshows the X-ray-optical position residuals for a typical\nXMM-Newton observation.\nL54 M. G. Watson et al.: The XMM-Newton Serendipitous Survey. I.\n3.3. Survey sensitivity\nThe major uncertainty in predicting the EPIC sensitiv-\nity pre-launch was the background levels which would\nbe encountered in-orbit. The actual in-orbit background\nlevels measured in the \frst part of the Lockman Hole\nobservation are \u0019(2:1; 2:9) 10\u22123 ct s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 for\nthe EPIC pn camera in the soft (0.5{2 keV) and\nhard (2{10 keV) bands respectively. Very similar values:\n\u0019(2:0; 2:6) 10\u22123 ct s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 are found for the two\nEPIC MOS cameras combined. A signi\fcant fraction of\nthis background, particularly at hard X-ray energies, is\ndue to residual particle background with contributions\nfrom both high energy particles interacting with the body\nof the EPIC detectors and from soft protons scattered into\nthe focal plane by the X-ray mirrors. These background\nlevels correspond to the nominal quiescent background\ndetected outside of background flares at high galactic\nlatitudes and appear to be relatively stable and repro-\nducible over the \frst 9 months of science operations2.\nDuring background flares the background can increase by\nlarge factors (> 10 is not uncommon) and portions of\nthese data are of limited use for faint source detection or\nthe mapping of low surface brightness emission.\nUsing the nominal quiescent background values to-\ngether with the measured XMM-Newton PSF we have\ncomputed an updated EPIC point source sensitivity based\non a simple 5\u001b source detection criterion against assumed\npurely Poissonian background fluctuations, as shown in\nFig. 33. Empirical data from analysis of several XMM-\nNewton \felds using the source detection software devel-\noped by the SSC for the SAS are broadly consistent with\nthese plots. The actual background in an observation de-\npends critically on the fraction of background flares re-\nmoved, i.e. the trade-o\u000b between net background levels\nand net exposure time. An investigation of a few example\n\felds demonstrates that the e\u000bective sensitivity of typical\nobservations is within a factor 2 of the values plotted in\nFig. 3. A few observations are a\u000bected by enhanced back-\nground throughout; here the average background can be\nseveral times higher than the nominal values even after\nthe removal of the largest flares.\nAt very faint fluxes the e\u000bective sensitivity is lim-\nited by confusion e\u000bects. Although a detailed study of\nsource confusion has not yet been carried out, the long\n2 The soft band (0.5{2 keV) background levels of course show\na factor of few change over the sky due to intrinsic variations\nin the Galactic foreground, cf.

The hard band\nbackground shows much smaller variation, except at very low\nGalactic latitudes.\n3 The 5\u001b value represents a relatively conservative limit\nwhich crudely takes into account the fact that there are ad-\nditional systematic background e\u000bects which have yet to be\ncharacterised in detail. For the e\u000bective beam area of XMM-\nNewton, the appropriate limit for purely Poissonian back-\nground fluctuations to yield \u0014 1 spurious source per \feld is\n\u00193:5\u2212 4\u001b.\nFig. 3.

The XMM-Newton Serendipitous Survey\n4.1. Scope and scienti\fc potential\nThe high throughput, large \feld of view and good imag-\ning capabilities of XMM-Newton mean that it detects\nsigni\fcant numbers of serendipitous X-ray sources in\neach pointing, as is illustrated in Fig. 1. To quantify\nthe serendipitous source numbers expected from XMM-\nNewton observations we note that for the typical expo-\nsure time of 20 ksec, XMM-Newton will detect sources\ndown to \u001910\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 0.5{2 keV band, and\n\u001910\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 2{10 keV band, these val-\nues referring to a 5\u001b detection in the combined EPIC pn\nand MOS cameras (cf. Fig. 3). The X-ray source density\nat these flux levels in the high latitude sky is already es-\ntablished from ROSAT studies in the soft band (Hasinger\net al. 1998) and has now been extended to harder energies\nby recent Chandra and XMM-Newton studies (Mushotzky\net al. 2000; Giacconi et al. 2000; Hasinger et al. 2001).\nTaking into account the telescope vignetting which re-\nduces the sensitivity o\u000b-axis and the distribution of ex-\nposure times yields an expected \u001850{100 sources per typ-\nical EPIC \feld (over the whole \feld, i.e. in a sky area\n\u00190.2 sq. deg.). Around 30{40% of these are expected to\nbe detected in the hard band, smaller than might have\nM. G. Watson et al.: The XMM-Newton Serendipitous Survey. I. L55\nTable 1.

The source\ncontent of these \felds is summarised in Table 1 (note that\nthe numbers are given for o\u000b-axis angles \u0014 12 arcmin, i.e.\nan area of \u00190.125 sq. deg.; the full \feld numbers are 25{\n30% higher). The source numbers in the high latitude and\nmid-latitude \felds are in general accord with our expecta-\ntions (predicted numbers in Table 1 are for the Hasinger\net al. 1998; Giacconi et al. 2000 source counts and the\nsensitivities given in Fig. 3 with an approximate correc-\ntion for the sensitivity decrease o\u000b-axis due to telescope\nvignetting; these predicted numbers are only accurate to\n10{20%). The G21.5\u22120.9 \feld, at low Galactic latitude\nand with a high column density (NHI+NHII \u0019 1023 cm\u22122),\nsamples a rather di\u000berent source population as shown\nby the somewhat lower source density and the fact that\nthere is little correspondence between the soft and hard\nband detections. In the soft band the detections in this\n\feld are likely to be dominated by foreground objects,\nmost of which will be active stars (see Sect. 5). In the\nhard band the faint source population revealed is likely to\nbe dominated by a mixture of background extragalactic\nsources seen through the Galactic disk and distant (and\nhence similarly absorbed) luminous Galactic objects which\nmay include cataclysmic variables and other low luminos-\nity accreting systems. The approximate calculation of the\nexpected extragalactic source numbers in the G21.5\u22120.9\n\feld given in Table 1 (sensitive to the column density dis-\ntribution) indicates that a signi\fcant fraction, but not all,\nof the hard band sources maybe background objects.\nWith the current operational e\u000eciency, XMM-Newton\nmakes of the order 500{800 observations per year, covering\n\u0018100 sq. deg. of the sky. The XMM-Newton serendipitous\nX-ray catalogue will thus grow at a rate of \u001850 000 sources\nper year, i.e. the annual rate will be comparable in size to\nthe complete ROSAT All Sky Survey, but will go to fluxes\n2{3 orders of magnitude fainter. The catalogue will thus\nconstitute a deep, large area sky survey which will rep-\nresent a major resource for a wide range of programmes.\nThe extended energy range of XMM-Newton, compared\nwith previous imaging X-ray missions such as ROSAT and\nthe Einstein Observatory, will mean that XMM-Newton\nis expected to detect signi\fcant numbers of obscured and\nhard-spectrum objects (e.g. obscured AGNs, heavily ab-\nsorbed Galactic binaries) which are absent from earlier\nstudies. This will provide an important extra dimension\nto the serendipitous catalogue.\nChandra observations will also provide a serendipi-\ntous sky survey comparable in many ways to what XMM-\nNewton can o\u000ber. Nevertheless a number of factors, in\nparticular the smaller \feld of view with good imaging\nquality and the fact that the full ACIS array is not al-\nways selected by the observer, contribute to producing a\nsigni\fcantly smaller sky coverage (by a factor 5{10) for\nthe Chandra serendipitous sky survey. XMM-Newton also\nhas a very signi\fcant advantage at photon energies above\n4{5 keV: at low energies the ratio of EPIC\/ACIS e\u000bective\nareas is 3{4 but this increases to \u00186 at 5 keV and > 10 at\n7 keV. The XMM-Newton serendipitous sky survey is thus\nlikely to contain much larger samples of highly obscured\nsources, an important factor for the study of the objects\ncurrently believed to make up the bulk of the X-ray back-\nground (cf. Lockman Hole study of the 5{10 keV source\ncounts, Hasinger et al. 2001).\nX-ray selection of samples provides a well-proven and\nextremely e\u000ecient means of \fnding some of the most as-\ntrophysically interesting objects, many of which have their\npeak luminosity in the X-ray band. XMM-Newton, with\nits broad-band and high sensitivity will provide less biased\nsamples than those based on previous soft X-ray missions.\nIt is clear that the XMM-Newton serendipitous source cat-\nalogue will prove to be a major resource in many areas of\nscienti\fc investigation. Examples include:\n{ the importance of obscuration in the faint AGN\npopulation;\nL56 M. G. Watson et al.: The XMM-Newton Serendipitous Survey. I.\n{ the evolution of the quasar luminosity function with\nredshift;\n{ the nature of faint X-ray galaxies - their contribution\nto the X-ray background;\n{ the evolution and luminosity function of clusters of\ngalaxies and the nature of density fluctuations in the\nearly Universe;\n{ the coronal activity in stars and its dependence on\nluminosity, spectral type, stellar rotation and age;\n{ the space density of accreting binary systems.\n4.2. Need for follow-up studies\nIn order to exploit the full potential of the XMM-Newton\nserendipitous survey in the context of a wide range of sci-\nenti\fc programmes, the key initial step will be the \\iden-\nti\fcation\" of the X-ray sources, i.e. a knowledge of the\nlikely classi\fcation into di\u000berent object types. For the\nXMM-Newton serendipitous sources, the X-ray observa-\ntions themselves will provide the basic parameters of each\nobject: the celestial position, X-ray flux for all sources\nand information on the X-ray spectrum, spatial extent\nand temporal variability for the brighter objects detected.\nThis information alone may, in some cases, be su\u000ecient to\nprovide a clear indication of the type of object, but for the\nvast majority of sources, additional information will be re-\nquired before a con\fdent classi\fcation of the object can\nbe made. Some of this information will come from existing\nastronomical catalogues, or from existing or planned large-\nscale optical, IR and radio surveys (e.g. SDSS, 2MASS,\nDenis, FIRST\/NVSS), but it is clear that the full exploita-\ntion of the XMM-Newton serendipitous survey will require\na substantial programme of new observations, primarily in\nthe optical and IR using ground-based facilities.\n4.3. The SSC Follow-up (XID) Programme\nThe overall aim of the SSC Follow-up Programme, for sim-\nplicity the \\XID Programme\", is to ensure that the po-\ntential of the XMM-Newton serendipitous survey can be\nfully exploited by the astronomical community. The XID\nProgramme is thus designed to maximise its value for a\nwide range of potential scienti\fc uses of the serendipi-\ntous data. In order to ensure the optimum utility of the\nprogramme, the results from the SSC XID Programme\nwill enter the public XMM-Newton Science Archive4. The\nvalue of building a \\statistically\" identi\fed catalogue of\nEPIC sources and delivering it to the community is that\nit will provide large homogeneous samples for studying\nclass properties and to search for rare objects.\n4 The SSC XID Programme is restricted to XMM-Newton\ndata which is in the public domain, i.e. outside the 1-year\nproprietary period, except for observations where the XMM-\nNewton observer has given explicit permission for the SSC to\ncommence follow-up work in the proposal for XMM-Newton\nobservations.\nTable 2.

The\nmain new observational elements, the \\Core Programme\"\nand the \\Imaging Programme\", are outlined below.\n4.4. The XID Core Programme\nThe aim of the Core Programme is to obtain the identi\f-\ncations for a well-de\fned sample of X-ray sources drawn\nfrom selected XMM-Newton \felds, primarily using opti-\ncal\/IR imaging and spectroscopy. Imaging is required both\nto locate potential candidates accurately and reveal their\nmorphology, whilst the optical spectroscopy provides the\ndiagnostics needed both for object classi\fcation and for\ndetermining basic object parameters such as redshift and\nspectral slope. The principal objective is to obtain a com-\npletely identi\fed sample which can be used to characterise\nthe XMM-Newton source population overall su\u000eciently\nwell that we can use the basic X-ray and optical parame-\nters to assign a \\statistical\" identi\fcation for a large frac-\ntion of all the sources in the XMM-Newton serendipitous\nsource catalogue.\nThe strategy involves two samples: one for the high\nand one for the low galactic latitude sky. The high galac-\ntic latitude sample consists of three subsamples, each con-\ntaining \u00191000 X-ray sources in three broad flux ranges:\nfx > 10\u221215 ; fx > 10\u221214; fx > 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the\n0.5{4.5 keV band (see Table 2). The size of the subsamples\nis dictated by the need to identify enough objects to re-\nveal minority populations. Studying sources at a range of\nX-ray fluxes is necessary because we already know that the\nimportance of di\u000berent source populations changes with\nX-ray flux level. A parallel study is planned for the low\ngalactic latitude sample. Taking into account the di\u000eculty\nof obtaining completely identi\fed samples close to the\nGalactic plane, here we aim to identify a sample of \u00181000\nsources above a flux level of \u00195 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121(0.5{\n4.5 keV), from target \felds covering a range of galactic\nlatitudes and longitudes (Table 2). In our programme we\nalso need to minimise bias against any particular X-ray\nspectral form by recognising flux limits in di\u000berent X-ray\nM. G. Watson et al.: The XMM-Newton Serendipitous Survey. I. L57\nbands. To achieve this, additional soft and hard X-ray se-\nlected samples will be included in the programme.\nThe requirements for the Core Programme are sum-\nmarised in Table 2. The median optical magnitudes in\nTable 2 (and the size of the subsamples) illustrate that\nthis is a very demanding programme. For example spec-\ntroscopy of the counterparts to the faintest X-ray sources\nwill require access to multi-object spectrographs on 8{\n10 m class telescopes, and indeed a substantial fraction\nof counterparts will be inaccessible, whilst even for the\nsources in the \\medium\" flux sample access to 4{8 m class\ntelescopes will be needed. For the \\bright\" sample the sit-\nuation will be somewhat di\u000berent in that a large fraction\nof counterparts will be on existing optical sky survey ma-\nterial (e.g. POSS), and a signi\fcant fraction may have\nlikely identi\fcations with catalogued objects, leading to\nreduced requirements for spectroscopic follow-up.\nTaking into account the fact that reaching the faint\nsample depth requires long XMM-Newton exposures, and\nthat most of these observations are being pursued for sur-\nveys by the observation PIs, the current emphasis in the\nSSC XID programme is on the medium flux sample (and\nlater as the observations become available, on the bright\nsample) which, although ambitious, is feasible provided\naccess to the necessary ground-based observing facilities\nis possible.\n4.5. The Imaging Programme\nWhilst the Core Programme focuses on the identi\fcation\nof a selected subsample of XMM-Newton serendipitous\nsources, the complementary Imaging Programme aims to\nobtain optical\/IR photometry and colours for a large num-\nber of XMM-Newton \felds. The programme rationale is\nbased on the fact that a combination of X-ray flux and\nX-ray colours (from the XMM-Newton data) and opti-\ncal magnitude and optical colours (e.g. from new ground-\nbased observations) will provide the key parameters which\nmake possible an accurate \\statistical\" identi\fcation of\nthe XMM-Newton sources. This will be possible using the\nresults from the Core Programme which characterise the\nXMM-Newton source populations, thus providing the link,\nin a statistical sense, between the source identi\fcation and\nthese basic parameters.\nMulti-colour optical imaging provides good discrimi-\nnation between object types (e.g. AGN-star separation)\nas well as photometric redshifts, whilst IR imaging has\nan important role to play as the counterparts to obscured\nX-ray sources are expected to also show signi\fcant red-\ndening.\nThe Imaging Programme will primarily be pursued us-\ning new optical\/IR imaging. To reach R \u0018 23\u2212 25m, and\nK \u0018 20m, the typical values required for the serendipi-\ntous survey follow-up, is within the range of 2{4 m class\ntelescopes5.\n5 Imaging from the XMM-Newton OM (Mason et al. 2001)\nwill in many cases provide valuable data for the Imaging\nProgramme, in particular by extending the coverage to the\n5. XID Programme implementation and \frst\nresults\nThe SSC XID Programme started in April 2000 with\ninitial optical and IR imaging and the \frst spec-\ntroscopic data were taken in June 2000. As noted\nabove, the current emphasis of the programme is on\nthe medium flux sample (cf. Table 2). A substan-\ntial fraction of the observing time for the current\nprogramme was awarded within the Canary Islands\nInternational Time Programme (ITP) to a project, known\nas \\AXIS\" (An XMM-Newton International Survey,\nhttp:\/\/www.ifca.unican.es\/\u0018xray\/AXIS) which fo-\ncuses on the follow-up of the medium flux XID sample\nand the nature of the hard X-ray source population.\nOptical imaging has been obtained for more than 30\nXMM-Newton \felds using the INT Wide Field Camera\nand the ESO-MPG 2.2 m Wide Field Imager. The Sloan\nu; g; r; i; z bands have been chosen for optical imaging\nas these provide signi\fcant advantages for the determina-\ntion of spectroscopic redshifts. Near-IR imaging of a few\n\felds has already been obtained with the INT 2.5 m and\nthe CIRSI IR camera in the H band (CIRSI does not of-\nfer the K band). For spectroscopy, three short runs have\nalready been completed using the WHT 4.2 m with the\nWYFFOS multi-object spectrograph, the WHT with the\nISIS dual-beam spectrograph and with the NOT 2.5 m\nwith the ALFOSC spectrograph. The WHT spectroscopy\nwith WYFFOS can reach R \u0018 21m and \u0018 22m with ISIS.\nThe NOT\/ALFOSC spectroscopy concentrated on objects\nwith R < 18m.\nWe have already obtained spectroscopic identi\fcations\nfor \u001840 XMM-Newton sources in the \frst few \felds stud-\nied. These \felds include the Mkn 205 \feld (cf. Fig. 1 and\nTable 1, we used detections from the combined data of\nthe two exposures), three of the \fve G21.5\u22120.9 calibra-\ntion observations (these cover \u00180.5 sq. deg; cf. Fig. 1 and\nTable 1 which relate to one of the \fve observations), and\ntwo Guaranteed Time (GT) \felds at high galactic latitude.\nFigure 4 shows the \fnding charts and optical spectra of\nthree example identi\fcations made in these \felds:\n{ A z = 0:33 galaxy in the Mkn 205 \feld showing H\f and\n[OIII] narrow emission lines at \u0015\u00156466; 5803; 6595 \u0017A.\nJudging by its X-ray luminosity (LX \u0019 1043 erg s\u22121)\nand line ratios this galaxy probably hosts an active\nnucleus;\n{ An object at z = 1:82 in a GT \feld6 which shows\nbroad emission lines (notably Si IV, C IV, CIII] &\nMg II at \u0015\u00153939; 4365; 5381; 7890 \u0017A) with broad blue-\nshifted absorption troughs to the CIV & CIII] lines\n(arrowed in Fig. 4). This thus appears to be a broad\nabsorption line (BAL) quasar. If con\frmed this would\nUV. Availability of appropriate OM data cannot be guaran-\nteed however, because the choice of OM readout modes, \flters\netc. are selected by the observation PI.\n6 A \feld for which SSC follow-up permission was granted by\nthe observation PI.\nL58 M.

The strongest\nlines are Ly\u000b, CIV & CIII] at \u0015\u00153959; 5040; 6212 \u0017A.\nAlthough it is premature to discuss the results in any de-\ntail at this stage, as our programme has yet to accumulate\nstatistically useful samples of identi\fcations, we can nev-\nertheless make some general remarks. In the high galactic\nlatitude \felds for which we have spectroscopic data so far,\nbroad-line AGN (15 objects) dominate the total number\nof identi\fed sources. The other identi\fed objects include\n4 narrow emission line galaxies (NELGs; in this context\nthis means extragalactic objects with no obviously broad\nlines), 1 \\normal\" galaxy and 3 stars (2 of which are dMe).\nAs found in previous ROSAT surveys, e.g. Lehmann\net al. (2000), all the NELGs are at z < 0:5. Some of these\nNELGs may actually be obscured AGN, but more thor-\nough analysis and better quality spectra are required to\ncon\frm this. Our programme has not yet found an exam-\nple of a high redshift type II AGN, but this is as expected\nbecause we have concentrated on the X-ray and optically\nbrighter objects so far.\nIn the one low latitude region for which we have spec-\ntroscopy so far (the three overlapping G21.5\u22120.9 \felds),\ninitial problems in establishing good astrometry for the\n\feld led to poorer X-ray source positions. Because of the\nhigh star density at low latitudes, this exacerbated the dif-\n\fculty of selecting optical counterparts. Accordingly our\nobservations to date have concentrated on the brighter\noptical counterparts. Of the 27 sources observed to date,\n11 show clear stellar spectra. Only 3 of these show clear\nspectroscopic evidence of being active at the current spec-\ntroscopic resolution; this highlights the fact that XMM-\nNewton can detect stars with lower activity. Analysis of\nthe data for the other objects observed is still in progress.\nGiven the current emphasis on the brighter counterparts,\nit is not surprising that our study has not yet revealed\nother classes of object, e.g. distant, faint cataclysmic vari-\nables or even background AGN which will be both faint\nand highly reddened.\nThe XID programme is in the early stages of what\nis a long-term project. We look forward to realising the\npotential of the XMM-Newton serendipitous survey over\nthe coming years in what seems likely to be a rich and\nrewarding programme.\nAcknowledgements.
