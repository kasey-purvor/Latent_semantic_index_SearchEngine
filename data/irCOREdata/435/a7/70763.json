This study is based on \ndata gathered in an interview project that involved 40 13\/14-year-old learners of \nEnglish and German from all over Hungary. The results reveal that tourism does \nnot create many contact opportunities for the majority of students in this country \nand that in this particular foreign language setting indirect contact through \nvarious cultural products is the most frequent means of gaining information \nabout target language speakers and their culture. The participants were found to \ndisplay a wide variety of attitudes towards a considerable number of aspects of \nthe target language culture. Students reported that cross-cultural contact helps \nthe development of their communicative competence and contributes to the \nincrease of their motivation and the decrease of language use anxiety.  \nKey words: inter-ethnic contact, motivation, attitudes, foreign language learning, \ncommunicative competence. \n 3 \n \nIntroduction \n \nDespite the fact that the relationship between language attitudes and language learning \nmotivation has been researched thoroughly in the past decade (for a recent summary see \nD\u00f6rnyei, 2005), considerably less attention has been paid to one of the possibly most \nimportant antecedents of language attitudes and its impact on language learning \nmotivation, namely, inter-cultural contact. Inter-cultural contact is an important issue in \nsecond language acquisition for several reasons. First of all, one of the main aims of \nlearning second and foreign languages is to be able to communicate with members of \nother cultures who do not speak one\u2019s mother tongue. In addition, interaction with \nspeakers of other languages creates opportunities for developing L2 learners\u2019 language \ncompetence (see e.g. Swain\u2019s (1985) output hypothesis). The learners\u2019 experience of \nthese encounters can influence both their disposition to the target language and their \nattitude to L2 speakers and the L2 culture. Inter-cultural contact can also be assumed to \naffect L2 learners\u2019 motivated behavior, that is, the energy and effort they are willing to \nput into the L2. Therefore, as D\u00f6rnyei and Csiz\u00e9r (2005) pointed out, \u201cintercultural \ncontact is both a means and an end in L2 studies\u201d (p.2). \nMost studies even in the field of social psychology (for a review see Pettigrew, \n1998) use questionnaires to investigate the role of inter-cultural contact in shaping \nattitudes and influencing behavior. In these questionnaires, contact is primarily \noperationalized as the frequency of meeting members of different social or ethnic \ngroups, and attitude scales generally contain stereotypical statements about the \noutgroup. In many language learning situations such as Hungary, however, students live \nin a mainly monolingual society, where inter-ethnic contact in which a language other \nthan Hungarian is used is not very frequent and typically involves meeting foreign \nvisitors to the country. These encounters, however, are brief and superficial (D\u00f6rnyei & \nCsiz\u00e9r, 2005; Stephan, 1987), and differ from situations where different ethnic and \nsocial groups have daily and close contact with each other. Therefore standard \nquestionnaires used in social psychology that were developed in multi-cultural and \nmulti-linguistic environments are not applicable to these situations. Neither can we use \nattitude scales devised in previous studies, since it is impossible to foretell what \nattitudes L2 learners might show in these limited personal contact situations. An \nadditional problem is that in the case of English, which is often used as a lingua franca \nin many countries of the world, it is impossible to identify the specific ethnic and \ncultural groups that represent native speakers of the language (Widdowson, 1994, \n1997). As a result, in order to investigate the role of inter-cultural contact in foreign \nlanguage learning environments, we first need to explore what kind of contact students \nof foreign languages have, with whom and how frequently, what attitudes they display \nand how they see the role of contact in language learning. Thus, the aim of our paper is \nto explore what types of inter-cultural contact Hungarian schoolchildren have, what \nkind of language-related attitudes they can give account of and how they see the role of \ncontact situations in affecting their attitudinal and motivational dispositions towards the \nL2, the L2 speaking communities and the process of L2 learning. Our research is an \nexploratory study, which involved the analysis of interviews conducted with 40 \nHungarian school-children learning either English or German. In this paper, we first \nprovide a theoretical background to our study, which is followed by the description of \nthe research procedures. Next, we discuss what types of contact situations our \nparticipants experienced, what kind of attitudes they displayed and how these situations \n 4 \naffected their attitudes to the L2 as well as to L2 speakers and culture and what \ninfluence the inter-cultural encounters had on their motivated behavior.  \n \nReview of literature  \n \nOur research is based on the Contact Hypothesis, the roots of which go back to the post-\nWorld War II United States, where interracial relations became of central interest, and \nresearch was subsidized to find ways to reduce interracial prejudice. The seminal work \nof Allport (1954) created a theoretical background to this work by reasoning that \nfavorable circumstances, defined by Allport as equal status, common goals, co-\noperation and institutional support, were necessary for intergroup contact to lead to \nfavorable changes within the attitudinal dispositions of the individuals. Allport\u2019s work \nresulted in a wide variety of research projects ranging from naturalistic field work \nthrough highly controlled laboratory studies to representative surveys employing \nnationwide samples, which all aimed to reveal how circumstances affected the outcome \nof inter-group contact (see, Amir, 1969; Cook, 1978, 1985; Desforges, Lord, Pugh, Sia, \nScarberry, & Ratcliff, 1997; Desforges, Lord, Ramsey, Mason, Van Leenwen, West, \n1991; Hamberger & Hewstone, 1997; Hewstone, 1985; Islam & Hewstone, 1993; \nStangor, Jonas, Stroebe, & Hewstone, 1996). The majority of these studies were \nsuccessful in terms of proving that favorable circumstances as outlined by Allport might \nindeed have positive effects on interethnic attitudes. In his comprehensive review of the \nliterature of inter-ethnic contact, Pettigrew (1998) argued that from the many conditions \nbelieved to be necessary for optimal contact in earlier research, only five were essential: \nequal group status, common goals, intergroup cooperation, authority support, and \nfriendship potential.  \nAnother field of social-psychology that is relevant to our investigation is the \nstudy of inter-cultural attitudes and beliefs. The investigation of different types of \nattitudes is one of the most popular fields of research within social psychology because \nattitudes are supposed to shape how people behave (Allport, 1954), although it is a \nheated debate when and how exactly the cognitive and affective components of attitudes \nlead to actional responses (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1977; Hewstone, Stroebe, Codol & \nStephenson, 1988). Attitudes are usually assumed to be made up of cognitive, affective \nand behavioral components (e.g., Rosenberg and Hovland\u2019s (1960) tripartial attitude \nmodel). Scott also (1966) proposed that the affective, cognitive and actional \ncomponents of national attitudes interact in a complex and dynamic manner. The \naffective component comprises one\u2019s emotial reactions and feelings towards a country \nor a group of people, whereas the cognitive component contains attributes of the given \ncountry or ethnic group such as size, military power and wealth. The action component \ninvolves the way people respond to a nation or minority group; for example, whether \nthey think that more social help should be provided for a given group of people or \nwhether their country should start a war against another one. Scott (1966) cited a \nnumber of studies which indicate that people tend to have consistent attitudes, that is, \nthey \u201ctend to attribute favorable characteristics to nations (or groups or individuals) they \nlike and unfavorable characteristics to those they dislike\u201d (p. 82). He also argued that \nthe more information one has about a nation or group of people, the more complex \nhis\/her attitudinal disposition will become.  \n As for the field of second language acquisition, contact first appeared in \nCl\u00e9ment\u2019s (1980) model as a key constituent of motivation. The hypothetical model was \ntested by Cl\u00e9ment and Kruidenier (1983), whose results proved that frequent and \npleasant contact experience led to an increased linguistic self-confidence in L2 learners, \n 5 \nwhich, in turn, affected motivation in a positive way. High scores on the latent \ndimension of integrativeness, on the other hand, affected the frequency and quality of \ncontact in a positive way. An additional aspect of the relationship between contact and \nself-confidence was added by Labrie and Cl\u00e9ment (1986), who investigated a bicultural \nmilieu and found that negatively seen contact if frequent enough had positive impact on \nself-confidence, probably due to the fact that \u201cexperience in aversive contacts develops \nthe individual\u2019s expectations regarding the capacity to face successfully second \nlanguage usage in such situations\u201d (p. 279). The relationship between contact and self-\nconfidence proved to be important in the monolingual Hungarian context as well. \nCl\u00e9ment, D\u00f6rnyei and Noels (1994) concluded that all aspects of inter-ethnic contact \ncorrelated negatively with English use anxiety, English class anxiety, and positively \nwith self-evaluation of proficiency and self-confidence. Noels, Pon, and Cl\u00e9ment (1996) \nexamined the relationship between contact and self-confidence in terms of identity and \npsychological adjustment. Their results showed that students\u2019 interethnic contact with \nCanadians was positively related to their self-confidence in English. In a similar vein, \nCl\u00e9ment et al. (2001) concluded that more frequent positive contact not only led to more \nconfident language use but also affected the identification profiles of language learners.  \nIn certain learning environments, however, direct contact with L2 speakers is \nminimal, yet the L2 community may still be well-known to the learners through indirect \ncontact with it, that is, through the learners\u2019 exposure to a range of L2 cultural products \nand artefacts, such as films, videos, books, magazines and music. In their investigation \nof various L2 learning orientations, Cl\u00e9ment and Kruidenier (1983) isolated a factor that \ntapped the \u2018social-cultural\u2019 dimension of L2 motivation, which covered \u201can interest in \nthe way of life and the artistic production of the target language group\u201d (p. 285). The \npresence of this socio-cultural dimension characterized groups living in a multicultural \nmilieu, whereas for the groups in monolingual setting the factor included other \nmeanings such as general knowledge about the world and self. Cl\u00e9ment et al. (1994) \ninvestigated different motivational orientations in a largely monolingual Hungarian \ncontext, and they isolated a component called English media subsuming the \nconsumption of cultural products in English (British\/American\/Irish etc.). This factor \nreceived strong endorsement from Grade 11 students (17 year old) participating in the \nstudy, which highlighted the salient role that L2 cultural products play in familiarizing \nlearners with the L2 community and thus shaping their attitudes. In a longitudinal \nHungarian study D\u00f6rnyei, Csiz\u00e9r and N\u00e9meth (2006) found indirect contact to be one of \nthe main variables in their model describing motivated learning behavior, in which the \nrelationship between self-confidence and attitudes toward L2 speakers\/community were \nmediated through cultural interest. They found that the main source of contact with the \nlanguage is an indirect one, through the exposure to various L2-specific cultural \nproducts. D\u00f6rnyei and his colleagues argued that the extent of the learners\u2019 confidence \nin dealing with the L2 will determine the willingness of the learner to seek meaningful \nengagement with these cultural products, which in turn leads to an enhanced interest in \nthese (see also D\u00f6rnyei & Csiz\u00e9r, 2005). \n As can be seen in this review of literature, the effect of contact with L2 speakers \nhas been investigated solely by quantitative studies, which provide a global overview of \nhow encounters with foreigners in general affect language related attitudes, self-\nconfidence, anxiety and motivated behavior. Therefore, we have little knowledge of \nwhat kind of contact learners in a foreign language setting experience, and how the \nstudents involved in these encounters see the role of contact in their language learning \nprocess. In addition, we also need to redefine inter-cultural contact from the perspective \nof language learners in a foreign language setting. For situations where language \n 6 \nlearning for the majority of students in public education means the acquisition of highly \nprestigious languages spoken in the world and in their geographical region, inter-\ncultural contact means both personal direct and indirect contact with native and non-\nnative speakers of the target language as well as contact with cultural products (mainly \ndifferent types of electronic and printed media) in the target language. Most studies in \nsocial psychology primarily concentrate on direct personal contact which involves \nverbal communication between two social and\/or ethnic groups. In foreign language \nsettings, however, for many of the learners it is often typical to encounter visitors from \nabroad without direct personal contact. In these learning situations it is also frequently \nthe case that students gain information about target language speakers only by watching \nfilms, reading magazines and books, browsing the Internet; in other words through \ncontact with cultural products and artifacts.  \nThe research we describe in this article is explorative in nature, therefore the aim \nof this paper is not to present findings that are generalizable only to a limited extent, but \nto discuss how inter-ethnic contact is perceived by Hungarian adolescents, what kind of \nattitudes these learners display and how they see the effect of contact situations on their \nL2 learning motivation.  \n \nMethod \n \nIn April 2005 we conducted 40 structured interviews with 21 Hungarian students of \nEnglish and 19 students of German at various localities of Hungary. The interview \nstudy reported in this article constitutes the first phase of our investigations concerning \nthe role of inter-ethnic contact in L2 motivation.  \n \nParticipants \n \nParticipants of the study were 40 Hungarian students (19 male\/21 female) aged 13\/14, \nwho attended the final, eighth, grade of the primary\n1\n school system. In selecting the \nparticipants we tried to sample students evenly from each main region and type of \nsettlement in Hungary, while also including a balanced mixture of touristically \nfrequented and unfrequented places. 21 students studied English as a foreign language, \nand 19 learned German. Two participants studied both English and German. Table 1 \nincludes an overview of the distribution of participants. In addition to Budapest, two \nmajor provincial cities were chosen, one of which was situated close to the border with \nCroatia. Three small towns in Western Hungary were selected to represent touristically \npopular settlements, two of which have famous spas regularly frequented by foreign \nvisitors. One small town respectively in Eastern and Western Hungary was intended to \nrepresent border towns: one close to the Austrian and the other to the Serbian border. \nThe rest of the settlements were towns and villages where, based on official Hungarian \ntourism information (Central Statistical Office, 2005), inhabitants were unlikely to meet \nforeign tourists.  \nThe students within the particular schools were selected by the principal and the \nlanguage teacher(s) based on our request that we would like to interview students who \nare motivated in learning the foreign language and who are successful language \nlearners. The reason for choosing primary school students as participants for our \nresearch project is that they constitute the largest group of language learners in \nHungary, for whom studying a foreign language is compulsory. Our experience in \nconducting the pilot interviews also suggested that students who are successful and \nmotivated provided detailed discussions of their experiences and were willing to talk at \n 7 \nlength in the interview, while students not interested in language learning did not talk in \nsufficient detail. Due to the fact that our aim was to get an overview of students\u2019 contact \nsituations and the nature of their attitudes, it was important to obtain rich descriptions \nfrom the participants. \n \n \n--------------------------------- \ninsert Table 1 around here \n--------------------------------- \n \n \nThe interview  \n \nThe interview questions were based on D\u00f6rnyei\u2019s (2001) process model of motivation \nand aimed to cover most components of the motivational construct outlined in this \nmodel. Some questions were also formulated based on the results of a previous \nquestionnaire study by D\u00f6rnyei and Csiz\u00e9r (2005). The interview questions were piloted \nwith three students from the target population. The final 40 interviews were conducted \nin Hungarian by paid and trained professional interviewers in the selected 20 schools \nwith two students in each institution. The interviews took place individually in a quiet \nroom of the school and lasted for approximately 40 minutes. All the interviews were \nrecorded and transcribed by the paid interviewers. The transcripts were checked by the \nresearchers. The interview consisted of four main parts. First we asked for students\u2019 \nmain biographical data, then we collected general information on language learning \n(e.g., the best and worst experience concerning L2 learning). In the second part of the \ninterview, students talked about their attitudes towards L2 languages and L2 \ncommunities (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Austria etc). This was followed by \nquestions concerning the quality and quantity of intercultural contact the students had.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nData were analyzed in several steps following the principles of the constant comparative \nmethod (Maykut & Morehouse, 1994). The reliability of categorization was secured by \nhaving the two researchers analyze the data independently and then by checking \nconsistency. In case of disagreement, categories were refined and common standards \nwere established.  \n \nResults and discussion \n \nTypes of inter-cultural contact situations \n \nThe interviews revealed that in accordance with our definition above, in a foreign \nlanguage environment we need to differentiate two major types of inter-personal \ncontact: direct contact that involves verbal interaction (either spoken or written) with \nnative and non-native speakers of the target language and indirect contact, in the course \nof which students only see the target language speakers and do not talk to them or are \ntold about the people and culture of the L2 by an \u201cinfluential other\u201d (e.g. parents, \nteacher, siblings) (see earlier discussion in the literature review). Indirect contact also \ninvolved encounters with L2 cultural artifacts through various media (TV, Internet, \n 8 \nbooks, movies, magazines and newspapers) (Cl\u00e9ment & Kruidenier, 1983). Table 2 \ncontains an overview of the different types of contact situations and the distribution of \nparticipants who experienced these situations. \n \n--------------------------------- \ninsert Table 2 around here \n--------------------------------- \n \n \nAs regards direct contact, the interaction with L2 speakers can take place in the \ntarget language country, in any other country abroad where the inhabitants also speak \nthe target language as L2, and in the students\u2019 native country. In our sample 15 students \n(37.5%) had the opportunity to visit the target language countries (Great Britain, \nCanada, Germany and Austria) either with their parents or in the form of a school visit. \nThe length of these visits was usually one week, but some students spent one month in \nthe target language environment. Approximately an equal proportion of students of \nEnglish (n=8) and learners of German (n=7) visited the target language countries. 9 \nstudents (22.5%) used the L2 in other European countries and interacted with non-\nnative speakers of English (n=7) or German (n=2) during these visits. One student lived \nin a Scandinavian country and attended an international school where the language of \ninstruction was English.  \nThe majority of the direct contact situations, however, took place in the \nstudents\u2019 native language environment. 50% of students met and talked to native \nspeakers of the L2 in Hungary, and 25% of the participants were involved in \ninteractions in which the conversational partner was also a non-native speaker of the L2. \nThe same number of students (n=10) used English and German (n=10) in conversations \nwith native speakers. Learners of English (n=6), however, had more opportunities to \ntalk to non-native speakers of the target language than students of German (n=4). \nSeveral typical inter-personal contact situations in Hungary could be found in \nour interview data, the most frequent of which was meeting foreigners, both adults and \nchildren, in the participants\u2019 schools. This experience was described by one of our \ninterviewees in the following way. \u201cLast time students from Denmark came as \nexchange students, and pupils from our school also went to Denmark. Now those \nstudents whom they visited in Denmark came to our school\u201d (S26)\n2\n. Students also \ninteracted with foreigners in touristically frequented areas of Hungary; most typically at \nthe holiday resorts of Lake Balaton. Some areas of Western and Southern Hungary are \npopular among Germans and the Dutch who buy holiday houses or settle down \npermanently in the small villages of these regions. Some of our participants have \nregular contact with these people. Two of the participants were in the fortunate situation \nthat one of the members of their close family is a native speaker of German, therefore, \nthey have regular contact with someone whose mother tongue is the language they study \nat school.  \nDirect contact in a written form involved chatting with native and non-native \nspeakers on the Internet, communicating in traditional letters and email. Another type \ndirect contact situation was when students saw foreigners from a distance but did not \ntalk to them. 15 participants met tourists in Hungary in this way, and seven interviewees \nreported that they visited either the target language country or another European \ncountry, but they never talked to the people who live there. Students also get \ninformation from their language teachers about the target language country, its culture \nand people. Five students reported that their language teacher tells them about her \n 9 \nexperiences with the culture of the L2. One of the participants described this as follows, \n\u201cwe also learn about the English way of life. This is interesting because the teacher has \nalready been to England, and I would really like to see it myself.\u201d (S15). Another type \nof indirect contact can take place with the mediation of family members (n=7). \u201cWhen \nmy mother was in England, she made a video recording, and we watched these \nrecordings. I saw people talking in English on this video and I really liked it. (S15)\u201d, \nrecounted one of our interviewees. \nAs our interview data indicate, the most frequent type of contact with the target \nlanguage culture is through the printed and electronic media. Every student regardless \nof the language they studied mentioned at least one type of cultural product that they \nhave access to in the target language. Nevertheless, learners of English seem to have \nmore frequent contact with the Internet, books, films and magazines in English than \nstudents who study German.  This is understandable since most of the web-pages on the \nInternet are in English, and films are available in Hungary with English sub-titles, and \nrarely with German ones. The availability of simplified readers in English probably \naccounts for the relatively large number of students who read books in English (n = 11) \nas opposed to those who do it in German (n = 4). It was surprising to find that only a \nfew students read magazines in German (n = 5) despite the fact that at many large news \nstands magazines both in English and German can be purchased. One possible \nexplanation might be that students do not buy these magazines since they are rather \nexpensive in Hungary, but have access to them in school libraries. It might be the case \nthat school libraries are better equipped with English language books and magazines \nthan German ones because typically more students learn English than German in most \nof the schools (Hal\u00e1sz & Lannert, 2003). \nAs the results in Table 2 also show, all the students we interviewed had some \nkind of contact with the target language speakers and their culture. The most typical \npersonal contact situation for our interviewees is direct spoken contact, and within this, \nconversation with a native speaker in Hungary. Considerably fewer students had the \nchance to establish rapport with native speakers of the target language abroad. Indirect \ncontact is also frequent among our participants. Learners of English seemed to have \nmore opportunities for engaging in conversation with non-native speaking visitors than \nlearners of German because students met more visitors who speak English as L2 than \nGerman as L2. This is no surprise, as official Hungarian tourism data also shows that \nthe number of English speaking visitors to Hungary has increased, whereas that of \nGerman speaking ones is on the decrease (D\u00f6rnyei & Csiz\u00e9r, 2005). Contact situations \nin which the foreign language is used as a mediating language between the student and a \nforeigner who is also a non-native speaker were also frequent among our participants. \nThis shows that not only English, but also German can serve as a lingua franca for \nyounger learners in Hungary. Personal contact through the written media was found to \nbe rare and mostly computer mediated, whereas every participant had contact with at \nleast one type of cultural product in the target language. \n The analysis of the types of contact situations reveal that there are two major \nfactors that play a role in creating contact opportunities for interviewed children: the \nfamily and the school they attend. Parents play an important role in organizing and \nfunding family trips abroad, but the results also suggest that a high number of schools \nalso find it important to invite foreign visitors and organize exchange programs for their \nstudents. As an illustration, the two students who had the most intensive contact with \ntarget language speakers were from a remote and economically disadvantaged region of \nHungary, where the school took part both in an exchange program with students from \nGermany and Denmark as well as in a special program in the course of which \n 10 \nAmericans from various professions spent several months in the city. In the framework \nof this program students had extensive contact with American speakers of English. The \nrelatively frequent and long encounters with these visitors seemed to have offered a \nfriendship potential for the students, and in turn fostered positive attitudes towards  \nspeakers of the target language. The student from this town talked about this rewarding \nexperience in the following way. \n \nWe had people from America who were called global one ties. They were \nvisitors and taught us in our English classes. We had conversation classes with \nthem. They helped us with pronunciation. We took them for sightseeing tours. \nWe became really good friends with them. We met in the streets and stopped to \ntalk with them\u2026 (S25) \n \nAs the results suggest, the interviewed students do not meet tourists very \nfrequently, despite living in touristically frequented areas such as the capitol of \nHungary, Budapest. This might be due to the young age of the participants, and perhaps \nto the fact that with the exception of one student, the family of the students was not \ninvolved in the tourism industry. One of the participants, who lives in an area which is \nfrequently visited by tourists and where a high number of foreigners have permanent \nresidence, explained his lack of contact in the following way, \u201cthere are many Germans \nin this city, but I do not meet them very frequently, as I am busy with other things.\u201d \n(S35). The participant, whose mother rents rooms to tourists in a famous spa resort in \nWestern Hungary, however, uses his knowledge of English to communicate with their \nGerman guests regularly (\u201cWe have German guests, and most of them speak English. \nWe communicate with each other in English, and I enjoy it because I can make myself \nunderstood\u201d (S21)). The case of this student also shows the importance of English as \nlingua franca in Hungary. \n \n \nThe types of attitudes do students display \n \nThe interviews and the subsequent analyses revealed four main areas within the subject \ndomain of attitudes: (1) attitudes associated with the languages students were learning; \n(2) attitudes about the lifestyles of the different speech communities; (3) attitudes \nrelated to the wealth and vitality of the English- and German-speaking countries; and \n(4) attitudes linked to the personal and national characteristics of the L2 communities. \nAttitudes towards the languages were mostly affective in nature, while the other groups \nof attitudes displayed cognitive elements. Table 3 summarizes our attitude-related \nresults broken down according to whether these attitudes were positive or negative.  \n--------------------------------- \ninsert Table 3 around here \n--------------------------------- \n \n \nAs for the affective aspects of the attitudes towards the target languages, we \nfound that more students (16 students) expressed positive attitudes than negative ones (6 \nstudents) for both English and German, which might be explained by the fact that \nmotivated students were asked to participate in the survey. The negative opinions with \nregard to the languages were usually linked to various kinds of grammatical\/language \nelements that were perceived as difficult for some students. Some learners also \n 11 \nmentioned that they disliked the fact that words have several meanings in English. \nStudents\u2019 overall preferences for English or German were demonstrated by the fact that \nexcept for one student, all negative attitudes were accompanied by positive ones. \n We labeled the second group of attitudes, which were mostly cognitive in nature, \nas attitudes related to the lifestyle of various L2 communities. Within this large \nanalytical category, we could differentiate several subcategories, which are as follows:  \n \n\u2022 Housing (\u201cWell, I would like to go to the mountains in Germany. The houses \nlook so nice there, and the environment is so peaceful and quiet.\u201d(S30).  \n\u2022 Health\/Eating, drinking: \u201cAmericans live an unhealthy life; they live for the \npresent.\u201d(S36).  \n\u2022 Clothing: \u201cGermans are elegant.\u201d (S34).  \n\u2022 Safety: \u201cEngland is safer than the USA. In the USA there are more murders, and \nthere is terror like the WTC.\u201d (S29).  \n\u2022 Recycling\/cleanliness: \u201cI envy them because they are so conscious about \ngarbage collection. It is as if littering was a great sin. Vienna was extremely \nclean.\u201d (S12).  \nIt was interesting to observe that in terms of life-style, 14 year-old students \nfrequently expressed positive attitudes to housing mostly in connection with Germany \nand Austria. Also concerning Austria and Germany, interviewees frequently remarked \nthat towns and cities are clean, and that citizens attribute special importance to recycling \nand selective garbage collection. Some participants (especially female ones) praised the \nelegant way of dressing in Germany and England. Attitudes related to eating, drinking \nand healthy life-style were mainly mentioned in connection with Great Britain and the \nUSA. As regards Great Britain, two students talked about tea (\u201cI like their culture and \ncustoms, especially the afternoon tea\u201d (S2). Students often noted that Americans have \nunhealthy eating habits and as a result, they are overweight. Despite the facts that \nHungary is geographically very distant from the USA and that participants are in their \nearly teens, a number of students expressed their concern about terror and safety in the \nUSA even four years after the attack on WTC. The interviews were conducted before \nthe bombings in the London metro, hence the students\u2019 comparison with Great Britain \nas being safer (see the quote above). \nViews communicated about the wealth and vitality of the different speech \ncommunities had important explanatory power in a previous motivation-related study \n(D\u00f6rnyei, Csiz\u00e9r & N\u00e9meth, 2006). However, very few students had overt attitudes \ntowards the wealth of the different speech communities, as only five students mentioned \nthe high standard of living of the Germans and three that of Americans. One of the \nparticipants referred to the \u201cfrom rags to riches\u201d myth saying that \u201cIf somebody goes \nthere [to the USA], he\/she will become famous or rich easily. That\u2019s why I think so \nmany people would like to live there. You can achieve things much more easily in the \nUSA than here in Hungary\u201d (S26). Another interviewee commented on the \ntechnological inventions made in the USA in the following way, \u201cthey contributed a lot \nto the development of mankind with their inventions (S25).\u201d \n Another group of  attitudes revealed students\u2019 thoughts concerning some \npersonal and\/or national characteristics of the different speech communities. Adjectives \nthat students used to describe the British included nice, interesting, sophisticated, \nfriendly, polite, serious, elegant, calm, and helpful. Negative comments centered around \nadjectives like proud, domineering, reserved, aristocratic, and conservative. One student \nremarked that \u201con the surface they seem to be very polite, but you never know what \nthey really think\u201d (S19). Another interviewee commented on the British not being open. \n 12 \n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to introduce the Euro. They stick to their traditions and don\u2019t want to \nallow other people to become a member of their culture\u201d (S28). Many of these national \nstereotypes are in accord with a survey conducted with secondary school students in \n1991. In his research Hunyady (1996) found that Hungarian teenagers had the most \npositive attitudes among European, Asian and American nations to the British. Like our \ninterviewees, participants in Hunyady\u2019s survey praised the British for being intelligent, \nand the negative characteristics centered around being reserved. \nAs for the Americans, a number of students remarked that they are \u201cfreer than \nanybody else in the world\u201d (S28), and \u201cwithin limits they do whatever they want to do\u201d \n(S33). Positive characteristics included the Americans being curious, helpful and free. \nMost of the criticism concerned their unhealthy eating habits and its consequence of \nbeing overweight. The participants also mentioned that \u201cAmericans are always on the \nrun\u201d (S4) and that \u201clife is accelerated in the USA\u201d (S18).  In 1991, in Hunyady\u2019s (1996) \nsurvey, Hungarian secondary school students expressed more positive attitudes towards \nthe Americans than our participants. In the past 15 years, however, negative attitudes to \nAmericans were also observed in an earlier interview study by Kormos and Luk\u00f3czky \n(2004), who found that a considerable number of demotivated learners expressed a \ndislike for Americans. These learners blamed the Americans for the negative effects of \nglobalization and for playing an overwhelmingly dominant role in world politics. \nIn connection with the Germans and also the Austrians, although to a lesser \nextent, students mentioned that they were nice, friendly, understanding, tolerant and \nhospitable. Germans were also characterized as precise and punctual and as people who \nalways observe the rules. The Germans were mostly criticized for being cold, proud and \nloud. Two students stated that they did not like Germans because of the role Germany \nplayed in World War II.  Hunyady (1996) also found that Germans were very popular \namong secondary school students in 1991. Similarly to our interviewees, the \nparticipants of his survey also regarded Germans as diligent and sociable. \nAs regards similarities and differences between Hungary and the target language \nspeakers, students were divided as to whether they saw the two nations as similar or as \ndifferent. As a tendency, we could observe that participants who had direct contact with \ntarget language speakers in their home countries, mentioned that target language \nspeakers are similar to Hungarians.  Two students explicitly remarked that \u201cchildren are \nsimilar everywhere in the world\u201d (S4 and S26). Those who had limited contact \nexperience frequently characterized English and German speakers as strange or very \ndifferent from Hungarians. Another student stated that \u201cEvery country is different. \nThere are different countries in the world because everybody is unique\u201d (S1). \n The analysis of language related attitudes reveals that students display a variety \nof attitudes towards a considerable number of aspects of the target language culture. \nThey commented on housing, lifestyle, clothing, as well as health and environmental \nissues, and students were also able to characterize the nations to some extent. Although \ntheir attitudes are mostly schematic and superficial, the great variety of aspects they \nmention is worth noting. Not only is this range of attitudes relevant for future \nresearchers and questionnaire designers, but also for teachers, who might exploit \nstudents\u2019 interest in these fields when teaching about the target language countries and \ncultures.  \n \nThe perceived effect of contact \n \nThe analysis of the text of the interviews reveals that contact situations affect \nstudents in a variety of ways. One of the major influences is that L2 learners find \n 13 \ncontact situations important in developing their L2 competence. Participants perceive \nthat by engaging in conversations with foreigners, they can learn about how native \nspeakers use the language in real life, out-of-classroom situations. As one of the \nparticipants expressed, \u201cIt is a different situation to talk to a foreigner whose mother \ntongue we are learning than to learn in school\u201d (S3). In terms of the development of L2 \ncompetence, interviewees mentioned that contact situations \u201chelp to learn more about \nnative speakers\u2019 style of speaking and their vocabulary\u201d (S3), and to get used to NSs\u2019 \nspeed of talking and pronunciation. \nEncounters with NS were not only seen as opportunities to develop linguistic \ncompetence but also as means to learn about the target language culture (socio-linguistic \ncompetence \u2013 Canale & Swain, 1980). \u201cThen we talk about our customs and they tell us \nabout their customs. We talk about our nation, and they tell us about their people (S1),\u201d \nexplains one of our participants. \n Students\u2019 reports show that opportunities to meet target language speakers also \naffected their motivated behavior. When asked about participants\u2019 best language \nlearning experience in the lead-in phase of the interview, 4 of the 40 participants \nmentioned that it was an encounter in which they could use the language outside the \nclassroom. One of the students, who lived in a remote area of Hungary but whose \nschool organized a number of visits, described this experience in the following way: \n \nMy best experience in learning English? We had American visitors, and we took \nthem out for sightseeing. We talked in English to them about the sights and \nabout where we are. They were really cool. (S25) \n \nAmong the components of motivated behavior, effort and persistence were \nmentioned as being affected by inter-cultural contact. In terms of invested effort, \nsituations when the conversation between the target language speakers and the learner \nwent smoothly, contributed to increasing the time and energy the student was willing to \nput into L2 learning. \u201cIf I meet more English people, I will learn English more willingly \nbecause this is a world language, and I can make myself understood with everyone\u201d \n(S28), said one of the students. Experiencing difficulties in communicating also \nprompted some students to invest more effort into learning. As another interviewee \nexplained, \u201clast summer or the summer before that we were abroad, I was not very good \nat talking to foreigners. Then, I decided to invest more energy into learning English\u201d \n(S23). The mere chance of meeting someone with whom one can practice the L2 also \nhas an affect on invested effort if the student prepares for the encounter in advance. A \nparticipating student told us that \u201cmeeting foreigners is useful because then we can \nprepare for the conversation. We look up one or two words and can start putting \ntogether sentences about what we want to ask them\u201d (S25). \nAnother component of motivation that was influenced by contact with NS and \nNNS is foreign language anxiety. Students mentioned that contact opportunities reduce \ntheir anxiety when having to speak with target language speakers. One of the \nparticipants, who attended a school near the Serbian border and whose teachers \nregularly organized trips to Serbia  and invited Serbian children, explained that \u201cwell, \nsince I attend this school in X and meet foreign students and talk to them, I feel less \nanxious because I have to talk more often\u201d (S4). This finding is in line with results of \nCl\u00e9ment et al\u2019s (1994) study that showed that inter-ethnic contact reduced L2 anxiety. \nLast but not least, participants mentioned that if they experience contact with \nforeigners, their attitude towards them becomes more positive. Some other participants \nsaid that  \u201cI have always had a positive opinion about the English. I never thought about \n 14 \nthem in negative terms, and meeting them has just convinced me that they are nice \npeople.\u201d (S26). This quote shows that contact experiences might not necessarily bring \nabout a change in attitudes, but they provide further support for students\u2019 existing \npositive views. None of the participants reported that any of the encounters they had \nwith target language speakers changed their attitudes in a negative direction, neither did \nstudents inform us that their negative attitudes were reinforced. This might be due to the \nfact that none of the students engaged in contact situations for long enough to collect \nnegative experiences, thus none of them experienced a \u201cculture shock\u201d (Pool, 1966; \nStangor et al., 1996).  \nIn sum, students\u2019 perceptions of the importance of inter-ethnic contact reveal \nthat they think encounters with foreigners help them develop their linguistic and socio-\ncultural competence. Participants also noted that both successful and unsuccessful \ncommunication experiences increased the effort they put into learning the target \nlanguage. In line with findings of earlier research (Cl\u00e9ment et al., 1994), our \ninterviewees reported that they felt less anxious when having to use the L2 as a result of \ncontact experiences. Encounters with foreigners were also found to help sustain initially \npositive attitudes towards target language speakers and change students\u2019 attitudes in a \npositive direction. Being familiar with learners\u2019 perceptions of the role of inter-cultural \ncontact is very important since there is evidence that contact itself does not directly \nchange attitudes but through the mediation of the perceived importance of the contact \nexperience (van Dick et al, 2004).   \n \nConclusion \n \nIn our interview project that involved 40 13\/14-year-old learners of English and \nGerman from all over Hungary, we investigated what kind of contact situations students \nexperience, what kinds of language-related attitudes they display and how they see the \nrole of inter-cultural contact in language learning motivation. In this study we defined \ncontact as both personal direct and indirect contact with native and non-native speakers \nof the target language as well as contact with cultural products (mainly different types \nof electronic and printed media) in the target language. The analysis of the various types \nof contact situations revealed that tourism does not create many contact opportunities \nfor the majority of students in this country; it is rather family resources and relations as \nwell as school visits that play an important role in helping students experience personal \ninter-cultural contact. Our results also indicate that in this particular foreign language \nsetting indirect contact through various cultural products is the most frequent means of \ngaining information about target language speakers and their culture. These findings \nshow the high importance of schools and language teachers in establishing exchange \nprograms for their students as in a foreign language environment school-children do not \noften have the opportunity to meet and engage in communication with target language \nspeakers outside the school. Students should also be actively encouraged and supported \nto seek contact opportunities for themselves since the interview data suggest that many \nof the learners who live in touristically popular areas do not exploit this situation in \norder to practice the target language.  \nThe analysis of language related attitudes revealed that students display a great \nvariety of attitudes towards a considerable number of aspects of the target language \nculture. Their comments were centered around housing, lifestyle, clothing, as well as \nhealth and environmental issues, and students could also given an account of their \nattitudes concerning the nations the language of which they are studying. Students \nregarded contact situations as beneficial for a number of reasons and reported that cross-\n 15 \ncultural contact helps the development of their language competence (linguistic and \nsocio-linguistic) and contributes to the increase of their motivation and the decrease of \ntheir language use anxiety. Participants also noted that inter-ethnic contact influenced \ntheir attitudes to target language speakers in a positive way. \nIn Table 4 we summarize the major themes that emerged in our interviews that \nare relevant for measuring inter-cultural contact and its effect on language learning  in \nsimilar foreign language environments. As regards the types of contact situations, we \nfind it important to distinguish personal contact situations based on whether \ncommunication takes place between the students and the visitor or the host in the case \nof trips abroad. This distinction is somewhat similar to proximal and distal contact in \nthe field of social psychology (see e.g. van Dick et al, 2004).  Our research also \nhighlights the importance of cultural products as possible mediators of inter-cultural \ninformation. In the case of language-related attitudes, we suggest that future research \nshould not only survey national stereotypes such as the English are polite or the \nGermans are precise, but should include attitude scales related to the life-style of the \ntarget language speakers. In addition, before embarking on large-scale questionnaire \nstudies, it is highly recommended to carry out a small scale interview study in which \nattitudes held by the targeted population are identified.  Finally, when measuring the \neffect of contact on language related attitudes and motivated behavior, it is important to \nexplore how students perceive the importance of inter-cultural contact, since these \nperceptions often act as important mediators in changing attitudes and in turn affect \nbehavior. \nOur study has several limitations, the most important of which is that we only \ninterviewed motivated learners in order to gain rich and elaborate data. It would be \ninteresting to replicate this study with students who have varied motivational \ncharacteristics so that more insight could be gained into how contact affects the \nbehavior of less motivated learners. The present research was qualitative in nature \ntherefore generalization is only possible to a limited extent. Nevertheless, we hope that \nreaders of this article who work with students in a similar environment will also \nexperience the important role of inter-ethnic contact in shaping students\u2019 attitudes and \nbehavior. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Zolt\u00e1n D\u00f6rnyei, Edit Hegyb\u00edr\u00f3 Kontra and the three reviewers for their \ninsightful comments.
