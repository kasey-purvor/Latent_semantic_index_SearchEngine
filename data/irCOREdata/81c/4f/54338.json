Introduction \nChaos in digital filters is a phenomenon of implementational and applicational \nimportance [2-4].  A thorough understanding of chaos aids the implementation of a \ndigital filter, which avoids undesirable chaotic behavior [4].  On the other hand, \nchaotic characteristics in digital filters can be utilized to build cost-effective and \npossibly high-security nonlinear digital encoders\/decoders for communication \npurpose [3].  Therefore, an extensive exploration of this phenomenon in the real world \nis essential for the employment of these two practicalities [3,4].  There was an \ninvestigation on chaos in real (finite-state) second-order digital filters [2] where the \nquestion was raised, \u201cIn what sense can a real digital filter be considered to exhibit \nchaotic behavior?\u201d  It was then discovered that, \u2018the asymptotic behavior of a real-\nworld digital filter having a wordlength of only 16 bits is virtually indistinguishable \nfrom that of an infinite wordlength digital filter\u2019 [2].  Moreover, [1] shows that \ninfinite wordlength digital filters can exhibit chaotic behaviors.  As a result, it was \nconcluded in [2] that a real digital filter with a \u2018sufficiently large\u2019 wordlength can also \nexhibit chaotic behavior.  This paper is intended to further the investigation by raising \nanother question, \u201cWould a finite-state machine behave in a near-chaotic way even \nwhen its corresponding infinite-state machine does not exhibit chaotic behavior?\u201d \n \n2.  Behavioral Difference of Finite and Infinite Wordlength Digital filters \nTo explore on the above question, a finite wordlength digital filter, where its \ncorresponding infinite wordlength digital filter exhibits no chaotic behavior, is \nconsidered.  Now, we need to decide on the possible wordlength of which this real \ndigital filter might exhibit a near-chaotic pattern.  Since it was quoted previously [2] \nthat a digital filter with a wordlength of more than 16 bits exhibits a trajectory pattern \n 3\nthat is \u2018virtually indistinguishable\u2019 from that of an infinite wordlength digital filter, a \nwordlength of more than 16 bits should exhibit no chaotic behavior.  On the other \nhand, due to the number of states inferred by the number of bits of a digital filter, a \n\u2018sufficiently large\u2019 wordlength needs to be chosen for visibility of chaotic pattern on \ntrajectories [2].  Therefore, wordlengths of less than 16 bits are examined in the \nfollowing simulation. \n \nThe real digital filter example of [2] was simulated as shown in Fig. 1, where the \ninput-output characteristic of the staircase 2\u2019s complement L-bit quantizer was as \nshown in Fig. 2 [2].  Fig. 4 shows the corresponding trajectory of the real digital filter \nfor 31 bits (>16 bits), where it shows a non-chaotic pattern: a trajectory is on a single \nellipse [1].  Hence, the corresponding infinite wordlength digital filter is non-chaotic.  \nHowever, the trajectories of filters with wordlength of 13 and 16 bits shown in Figs. 3 \nand 5, respectively, exhibit a near-fractal pattern and thus exhibits a near-chaotic \nbehaviors [1]. \n \n3.  Conclusion \nFrom the trajectories simulated, a finite wordlength digital filter may behave in a \nnear-chaotic way even when its corresponding infinite wordlength digital filter is non-\nchaotic.   \n \n 4\nAcknowledgement \nThe work described in this paper was substantially supported by The Hong Kong \nPolytechnic University. \n 5\nReferences \n[1] Chua, L.
