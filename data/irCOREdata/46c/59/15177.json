The research has been\nfunded by an AHRC studentship, the Leverhulme Trust, the British Institute in Eastern Africa, the\nBritish Academy and consultancies with UNDP, the US Institute of Peace and the Rift Valley\nInstitute. It has benefited greatly from comments on a much earlier conference paper in 2006 from\n\u00d8ystein Rolandsen, Carol Berger and John Ryle, from conversations with Naseem Badiey, Leben\nNelson Moro and Rob Blunt, and from constructive suggestions on later drafts from Justin Willis,\nChris Vaughan, DavidMoon and Dave Eaton; its failings and opinions are of course the author\u2019s own.\nThanks also to the editor and to the anonymous reviewers, particularly for the latter\u2019s suggestions for\nfuture research directions raised by aspects of the paper.\nJ. of Modern African Studies, 49, 2 (2011), pp. 215\u2013240. f Cambridge University Press 2011\ndoi:10.1017\/S0022278X11000024\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nWriting in 2004, as the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement\/\nArmy (SPLM\/A) prepared to sign the Comprehensive Peace Agreement\n(CPA) with the Sudanese government, Branch and Mampilly (2005)\ndrew attention to the lack of a unified Southern Sudanese identity and to a\n\u2018rupture between the Dinka, dominant within the SPLA, and the\nEquatorian peoples of the far south\u2019.2 During the subsequent interim\nperiod, international and Sudanese commentators have increasingly\nfocused on these and other ethnic divisions in media and agency reports,\nleading some to question the viability of an independent Southern\nSudan, should its people vote for secession in the 2011 referendum.3\nCommentators have also criticised corruption within the interim\nGovernment of Southern Sudan (GoSS), and, by inference, the absence\nof the ethnically inclusive civil governance structures advocated by\nBranch and Mampilly. The latter emphasised the Dinka occupation of\nland in the Equatoria region as a major \u2018stumbling block\u2019 to internal\npeace and refugee returns. Since then, reports of tensions over land and\nof tribal conflicts in many areas of Southern Sudan have only pro-\nliferated.4\nAs the potential secession of Southern Sudan appears ever more likely,\nthis emphasis among analysts and reporters on ethnic division and tribalist\ngovernment needs to be urgently questioned. This paper argues that there\nare deeper shared popular perceptions across the supposed Dinka\u2013\nEquatorian divide, on the basis of research conducted since 2004, primarily\nin Dinka-speaking areas of Lakes State and Bari-speaking areas of Central\nEquatoria State. Interviews, conversations and documentary sources, from\ninternet media to chiefs\u2019 court records, inevitably revealed a great variety\nof opinion, perspective, language and idiom; the paper does not claim\nto represent a single, uncontested popular discourse. But it does suggest\nthat there are striking commonalities in social and moral concerns in\nboth states and among people of different ages, genders, livelihoods and\nlifestyles.\nThe paper argues that these common concerns centre on the commo-\ndification and monetisation of productive and reproductive resources, in-\ncluding human life itself, that have formed the basis of wealth and value\nacross Southern Sudan. Over the last century people have increasingly\nsought out money and market resources, but the resulting debate and\ncompetition within families and communities has reproduced a binary\ndistinction between the values of an idealised moral economy of kinship\nand reciprocity, and the immoral, individualistic cultures of money and\ntown. As this paper shows, this moral dichotomy transcends ethnic divi-\nsions, and underlies perceptions of government corruption and of the\n216 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nbroader changes wrought by the political economy of the 1983\u20132004 war\nand the subsequent interim period.\nThe paper uncovers this transethnic moral discourse, conversely, from\nthe starting point of ethnically divisive discourse about land in the\nsouthernmost three states of Central, Western and Eastern Equatoria. The\nfertile agricultural land of the central Equatoria Region is divided into\nclan territories, within which plots have been allocated \u2013 not sold \u2013 to use\nfor cultivation. Many of the inhabitants fled during the war; on their\nreturn in recent years, they have found their former plots occupied by\nsoldiers, officials and displaced people (IDPs) from cattle-keeping regions\nof Southern Sudan, commonly (but not always accurately) labelled as\nDinka. Some Equatorians report that the new occupants claimed to have\nbought the land during wartime with the buckets or tins of their blood that\nwas shed upon it. On one level this might indicate a vivid expression of the\nloss and suffering of the war and the resulting sense of entitlement among\nsoldiers and IDPs to a reward long promised by the SPLA leadership.\nEquatorians tend to deploy and denounce the alleged claims in the context\nof broader, bitter debates as to which ethnic groups or regions contributed\nmost to the liberation struggle.\nBut despite such ethnic politics, the paper argues that the rhetorical\nemphasis on \u2018buckets \u2019 and \u2018tins \u2019 of blood in these debates over land re-\nveals an intersection with the wider underlying moral concerns about the\nencroachment of an urban, monetary economy, associated historically\nwith army and government, into rural economies. The English-derived\nbackat and the colloquial Arabic safia are both used as specific units of\nmeasurement for grain and other consumables in the markets of Southern\nSudan (e.g. GoSS 2008).5 To use them discursively as a measurement for\nhuman blood is, the paper argues, a dramatic expression of the commo-\ndification of human life by the war, something which is discussed beyond\nEquatoria \u2013 often with similar rhetorical emphasis on \u2018blood\u2019 being sold,\npaid or monetised.\nThe first two sections of this paper explore the tensions over Equatorian\nland in more detail. The third section addresses the paradoxes of the\ndiscursive dichotomy between value systems that these debates reveal, and\nthe enduring capacity of rural moral discourse to regulate those who ap-\nparently challenge its predominance. Individuals who have profited from\nmonetary and military employment have gained patronage resources\noutside the rural political economy, which uses idioms and structures of\npatrilineal kinship to control productive resources like land and livestock.\nMoral condemnation of money and towns by elders has therefore been\nin part a reactive strategy to try to maintain the pre-eminence of\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 217\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nlineage-based claims to authority and seniority. But this discursive tool\nhas retained power to regulate people\u2019s behaviour because, as the mon-\netary economy has become increasingly dominant and penetrative, it has\nalso appeared ever more exclusive, predatory and unreliable. Most people\nhave had to fall back recurrently on the resources of family and rural\ncommunity, even as they aspire to participate in \u2018development\u2019 and the\nurban economy. The paradoxical result is an enduring moral discourse\nwhich simultaneously perpetuates a set of binary distinctions between\ntown and village, money and kinship, state and society, and yet impels the\nexpanding class of government employees and money-earners to cross\nthese divides and demonstrate that they are redistributing their income and\ninvesting in social relations.\nAnthropologists have examined similar moral dichotomies between\nmoney and other forms of value, particularly in cattle-owning societies\nin southern and eastern Africa (Broch-Due 1999; Ferguson 1985;\nHutchinson 1996; Shipton 1989). The focus of this paper is not, however,\non the specificities of the morally constituted economic barriers and con-\nversions in particular livelihood groups. Instead it shows that locally vari-\nable value systems nevertheless produce commonly shared perceptions of\nthe state and changing political economy. It therefore argues in its fourth\nsection that to fully understand the enduring popular ambivalence to-\nwards money, we need to explore the historical association of money with\ngovernment, as well as with the alienability and individualism highlighted\nby other studies. The ambivalence is shaped by opposition not just be-\ntween genders, generations or livelihoods, but also between state and\nsociety.\nThe simultaneous popular desire to exclude as well as to incorporate\nmoney and government resources complicates notions of patrimonialism\nand corruption, addressed in the final part of the paper. Some political\nanalysts have explained government corruption and neopatrimonialism in\nAfrica as a mutated version of deeply rooted social norms and practices.\nBut Southern Sudanese discourse instead locates the corrupt practices of\ngovernment in an entirely separate moral economy whose history is traced\nall the way back to the militarised commerce and enslavement of the\nnineteenth century. In this context, the expansion since the 1970s of\ngovernment employment, military recruitment, urban settlement and the\nmonetary economy is generating profound and disturbing questions.\nBeneath the apparently \u2018 tribal \u2019 conflicts over land, there are shared fears\nabout the disrupting effects of these trends on social relations and pro-\nductive economies, and a continuing desire to preserve a distance from the\nstate.\n218 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nL A N D A N D L I B E R A T I O N\nMany former inhabitants of the Equatorian states claim to have returned\nfrom wartime displacement to find their plots or clan territories occupied\nby soldiers or internally displaced people (IDPs), who declare : \u2018 I fought\nand liberated, I bought this land with my blood. \u2019 Equatorian politicians,\njournalists and commentators publicly denounce this as a distortion of the\nSPLA\u2019s broader struggle to defend the land of Southern Sudan. A meeting\nof the state governors and county commissioners of Greater Equatoria in\n2007 recorded: \u2018We sadly note that the term \u2018\u2018 land-grabbing\u2019\u2019 has come\ninto currency due to the faulty interpretation of why we made sacrifices in\nover 22 years \u2019 (Lokuji 2007).\nAnalysts are increasingly recognising the issue of land access and rights\nnot only as a root cause of Sudan\u2019s civil wars, but also as a vital determi-\nnant of the success or failure of the continuing peace process in Southern\nSudan (Johnson 2003, 2009; Pantuliano 2007). As Johnson (2009: 176)\nemphasises, alienation of land by government was the greatest common\ngrievance among the marginalised people of Sudan by the time the CPA\nwas signed in 2005. Having long claimed to be fighting to redress this, the\nSPLM\/A has repeatedly asserted that \u2018 land belongs to the community\u2019.\nBut the CPA, interim constitutions and GoSS legislation have remained\nvague regarding customary land rights (Badiey 2010; Deng 2010;\nRolandsen 2009). Conflicts, tensions and divisions within Southern Sudan\nhave increasingly centred on land and territorial disputes. As recent re-\nports find, the rhetoric of administrative decentralisation together with\nresource competition has led to the conflation of ethnic territory with local\ngovernment units, and given heightened significance to the boundaries\nbetween them (Rolandsen 2009; Schomerus & Allen 2010).\nUnprecedented levels of urbanisation since the CPA have generated\nparticular tensions as towns expand into formerly rural areas of communal\nterritorial rights. Some SPLM leaders have warned that GoSS could legally\nacquire such \u2018 tribally-held land\u2019, particularly around the capital, Juba\n(Badiey 2010: 251\u20135). Access to urban land holdings has always been\ngoverned on an entirely different basis from rural land rights, by the in-\ndividual monetary purchase of leasehold and by privileged access to the\ngovernment offices that distribute leases. Historically, the land on which\ntowns are situated was expropriated by government, and any prior in-\nhabitants were forcibly relocated, leaving lingering resentment and a sense\nof entitlement among their descendants. The land has then been leased\nprimarily to government employees, licensed traders and retired soldiers.\nAs urban populations have swelled in recent decades, particularly with\nreturning refugees and IDPs unaccustomed to rural life, the commercial\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 219\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nvalue of urban land has rapidly increased,making it a potential government\npatronage resource (Pantuliano et al. 2008: 29\u201332). Official land leases\nhave remained beyond the reach of most ordinary people, leaving urban\npopulations vulnerable to evictions and demolitions (Gatdet Dak 2009;\nDeng 2010). The commodification of land has thus largely been experi-\nenced as a threat to the land access of poor or average households, and as\nindicative of the alien, arbitrary ways of the hakuma (government).\nIn the Equatorian states, urban expansion has been further complicated\nby the wider tensions over immigration during and since the war from\nother states in Southern Sudan. Many Equatorians accuse GoSS or the\nSPLA of failing to protect the land rights of indigenous communities, and\nof actively participating in the seizure of land in and around the towns,\nparticularly Juba.6 The struggle over land has become entangled in wider\npolitical and military divisions along broadly ethnic lines (Branch &\nMampilly 2005). There are bitter debates between and among those who\nfought, stayed or fled during the war as to who contributed most or least to\nthe liberation struggle. Some Equatorians interpreted the depredations of\nthe SPLA from the 1980s as acts of occupation or revenge by a Dinka\narmy, rather than as \u2018 liberation\u2019 (Johnson & Prunier 1993: 127 ; Johnson\n2003: 67\u201370).7 Privately, some admit that \u2018even our own boys\u2019 in the\nSPLA were responsible for the military depredations. Indeed, across\nSouthern Sudan, civilians shared the traumatic experiences of the military\npresence, regardless of ethnicity (see Hutchinson 2001). But the ethnic\ntensions also derived from the earlier fears of \u2018Dinka domination\u2019 that had\nbeen stirred up by Khartoum and some Southern politicians during the\nSouthern Regional Government (1972\u201383).8\nBoth in the 1970s\u201380s and more recently, political and military divisions\nhave intersected with competition for land. Much of the central part of\nEquatoria is a fertile middle ground valuable for both cattle-keeping and\ncultivation, between the south-western forests, and the floodplains to the\nnorth.9 The tensions are often presented as inevitable conflict between\npastoralist Dinka and agriculturalist Equatorians, another simplification\nsince Dinka also grow crops, and many Equatorians possess cattle. The\nsituation was complicated by population displacement during the wars : as\nEquatorians took refuge in neighbouring countries, IDPs from other\nregions moved south into Equatoria. The conflict for land became closely\nmerged with perceptions of SPLA occupation when officers and soldiers\ntook over valuable plots in and around Equatorian towns from the 1990s\nonwards (de Wit 2004). For the local population, these appropriations\nseemed to confirm a threatening conspiracy among soldiers, IDPs\nand herders to take over Equatorian territory (Schomerus 2008).\n220 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nUnsurprisingly, there has been considerable resistance to the expansion of\nJuba town from the local Bari (Badiey 2010), as well as continuing tensions\nelsewhere in the Equatorian states between long-term displaced settle-\nments and returning indigenes.\nThe conflation of military appropriations with displaced settlement is\nparticularly apparent in the reported claims to land based on \u2018blood\u2019,\nwhich became more prominent from 2005, as Equatorians advocated a\npost-CPA exodus of IDPs back to their homelands. Equatorians reported\nthat displaced \u2018Dinka\u2019 were claiming that \u2018 they can\u2019t leave because they\nhave shed blood to obtain this land\u2019 ; \u2018 their blood was spilled in the area\nand therefore they have the right to stay\u2019 (Juba Post 15\u201322.5.2005,\n8.2.2008). Blood became a vivid rhetorical device for denouncing the in-\nference that Equatorians had contributed less to the SPLA struggle :\nIf a Kakwa10 said \u2018 this is my place or my plot \u2019, others claim that a payment of\nblood is needed. Whose blood? You have your own blood and I have mine. Then\nwhose blood should that Kakwa give you? I think all of us in South Sudan\nsacrificed \u2026 The Kakwa people are not cowards.\nLo-Lumori 2006\nAnother Central Equatorian journalist and politician developed this\nquestion further, arguing that those who claimed the land were doing so\non the dubious moral basis of the blood of their dead relatives :\nThese ones say their blood settled here ; they are the liberators ; there is a tin of\nblood poured there. But whose blood?! The one who died should claim the land!\nNot you on their behalf \u2026 That thing of blood is being used for personal gains.\nPolitician 1 int.\nSuch explicit references to blood have been recorded only in alleged\nquotation by Equatorians ; the new claims to land tend to be articulated\npublicly in more general terms of a reward owed to the liberation fighters.\nWhy then might these Equatorians lay such stress on the attributed claim\nof a \u2018payment\u2019 of blood in \u2018 tins \u2019 or \u2018buckets \u2019? Such obvious references to\nthe commodification of human life intersect with multiple layers of con-\ncern and debate, one of which, as we have seen, is the attempt to measure\nethnic\/regional contributions to the SPLA war and convert these into\nmaterial reward. But the condemnation of the use of wartime bloodshed\nfor personal gain resonates with moral discourse across Southern Sudan,\nas the later part of the paper will show. Firstly though, the discourse touches\non complex debates over land rights at a more local level, which in turn\nconnect with wider concern at the commodification of rural and kinship\nresources.\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 221\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nB L O O D O N T H E L A N D\nWithin and beyond contests over land, Equatorians do not dispute that the\nwar has left blood lying on the soil, but, like many other Southerners, they\ndepict this as a form of pollution: as a Kuku chief explained, \u2018much rima\n[blood] was shed during the war, and the land has been polluted; it requires\ncleansing\u2019.11 The chiefs of displaced Equatorian communities resident in\nJuba also describe the need to cleanse the land of blood before they return\nto live in former battlefields :\nWhen we return we will need to slaughter a bull and eat it and praise God for our\ncoming back. The blood of those killed there will be cleared because of this bull\nand no problems will come to us.\nChief 1 int.\nOther informants advocated such rituals and recalled comparable blood-\ncleansing sacrifices during their childhoods in the village (Professors 1 &\n2 int. ; Politician 2 int.), suggesting that the discourse of blood and land\ninvolves a complex interplay of cultures and languages ; at one level, the\npoliticians and \u2018 intellectuals \u2019 are debating globalised notions of blood, soil\nand sacrifice, but at a local level communities also draw on indigenous\nunderstandings of these notions and means of contesting them. If people\nare indeed claiming land on the basis of wartime bloodshed, this could\nsimilarly indicate cultural parallels with particular kinds of cattle sacrifice,\nwhich assert ancestral ownership of the land on which sacrificial blood is\nshed (e.g. Burton 1983; Lienhardt 1961: 295; Zanen & van den Hoek 1987:\n190).12 The articulation of vernacular and (inter)national concepts of\nsacrifice and blood is beyond the scope of this article, but there are two\nparticular points which complicate these comparisons.\nFirstly, Dinka informants insist that none of their multiple vernacular\nwords for sacrifice could be applied straightforwardly to the human blood-\nshed of the war. Despite the frequently observed commensurability of\nhuman and cattle lives and blood among, most famously, the Nuer\n(Hutchinson 1996), anthropologists have also emphasised the ambiguous\nand potentially polluting qualities of human blood, distinct from the\ncleansing or life-giving properties of sacrificial animal blood (Evans-\nPritchard 1956: 213\u201320; Buxton 1973: 211\u201312; cf. White 1997: 439\u201340).\nDeath in a Bor Dinka cattle-camp required \u2018washing away the blood of\nthe dead body\u2019 (Zanen & van den Hoek 1987: 182). As Hutchinson (2001 :\n326) shows, the SPLA war may have seen the renegotiation of ideas about\nblood pollution, but Nuer and Dinka have also expressed unease at the\nspiritual consequences of the human bloodshed of the war. The desire to\ncleanse blood from the land may therefore reflect deeper and wider\n222 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nspiritual concerns than is apparent from the political rhetoric over land\nin Equatoria. A sense of crisis over deaths from suspected witchcraft\nand poison in Kajokeji, for example, is attributed to the blood on the\nsoil undermining the power of spiritual land-chiefs to curse evil-doers\n(Moro, pers. comm. 2010). Shortages of rain in Western Bahr el Ghazal\nState in 2009 were also explained similarly by Fertit communities : \u2018People\nare saying the lack of rain is because of the war and all the blood that\nwas spilled on the ground. This blood is a very terrible thing\u2019 (Returnee\nint.).\nSecondly, sacrifices connected with ownership of territory are pre-\ndicated specifically on \u2018first-comer\u2019 rights (Burton 1983). While the right of\nnon-Equatorians to settle in Equatoria is generally articulated publicly by\nsoldiers and political spokesmen in terms of national citizenship rights\nor the liberation struggle, at the local level settlers have on occasion\nemployed a more indigenous concept of rights to unused land, claiming\nthat the land was unoccupied when they arrived (Badiey 2010: 334\u20137;\nSchomerus & Allen 2010: 23). At this level, Equatorian and immigrant\ngroups may be debating within a shared discourse and employing animal\nsacrifice and other rituals as idioms in which to assert land ownership.\nOne Juba District chief claimed that several Nuer soldiers had been killed\nin an accident because they had wrongly sacrificed cattle on his com-\nmunity\u2019s land (Chief 2 int.). Some Equatorians perhaps deliberately focus\ninstead then on the \u2018buckets of blood\u2019 claims precisely because these do not\nrest on an indigenous logic of autochthony or first settlement, and so can\nbe more easily repudiated. But the desire to reassert the rights of land-\nowning clan leaders, often enacted through rituals and sacrifices, is also\npart of a broader rigidification of definitions of community, in terms both\nof the territorial and administrative boundaries mentioned above, and of\nefforts to strengthen patrilineal structures and authorities in the face of\nperceived threats.\nBeneath the current land contest, there are shared cultural principles of\nancestral, patrilineal land rights. Both Equatorian and Dinka oral histories\nidealise the past arrival of newcomers by emphasising the respect they\nshowed to the existing inhabitants, often cemented by offers of new\nresources like cattle, rain-knowledge or iron-making, or by marriage.\nIn Equatoria, the original inhabitants are seen as the custodians of the\nfertility of the land, ensuring that they have continued to be shown respect\nas the land-owners or \u2018 landlords \u2019, even if other leadership roles have been\ntaken by \u2018 immigrant \u2019 clans (e.g. Buxton 1963). Some of the original land-\nowning clans have themselves migrated in recent times to other areas, but\nthey continue to be called upon to perform important rituals in their\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 223\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\noriginal territories. Their ritual invocations frequently begin with the\nconditional clause, \u2018 If this land is ours \u2019, any efficacy thus confirming their\nland rights.\nIt has been common for people to move to the lands of their maternal\nrelatives if necessary, and the inhabitants of clan territories or chiefdoms\nare by no means all related by blood (Buxton 1963; Retired politician 1\nint. ; Whitehead 1962). Even chiefs are not necessarily related paternally to\nthe dominant lineage, since it was common for adopted dependents to\ntake the risk of mediating government forces in the early colonial period,\nrather than the senior clan leaders (Leonardi 2007a). Nevertheless, an\nidiom of patrilineal kinship continues to structure inter- and intra-clan\nrelations and hierarchies, reinforced in strictly ordered distribution of\nmeat and drink during social and ceremonial events.\nHowever, as pressure for and the value of land has increased in recent\nyears, members of the land-owning clans complain that they are increas-\ningly disregarded in land transactions, and variously blame local govern-\nment officials, chiefs or other community leaders for allocating land to\norganisations or businesses without consulting them. As a result there have\nbeen intense intra-clan or intra-community debates over land, often along\ngenerational lines. According to one chief in Kajokeji, the landlords have\nbeen losing power recently because \u2018sons want to make money from the\nland\u2019.13 Around Yei, it was conversely the organised youth of some clans\nwho were protesting at the sale of land by their elders and chiefs in 2005\u20137.\nIn both cases though, the debate centres on whether clan land can be sold\nfor money.\nThe response of at least some senior clan members has been to seek to\nrestrict their allocation of individual plots to patrilineal relations, as one\npolitician from a land-owning clan explained:\nMost people living now in [clan territory near Yei] are our sisters\u2019 children,\npeople from broken homes \u2013 some are not even Kakwa. So we have to say who\nhas the right to exist there. We will get all the clan, even those who are abroad,\nand make a list. And it will be done [sub]clan by [sub]clan.\nPolitician 1 int.\nAround Juba, some chiefs have reportedly been allocating plots to\nEquatorians to the exclusion of other groups, \u2018particularly Dinka\u2019\n(Pantuliano et al. 2008: 30). But the debates over land reach beneath their\nethnic dimensions to connect with generational tensions and changing\nrelations between maternal and paternal kinship, as revealed in the reac-\ntionary attempts to restrict land to agnatic rather than affinal or assimilative\nblood relations.14\n224 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nBy focusing on the alleged claims that land has been \u2018bought \u2019 with blood,\nthe Equatorians cited in this paper are apparently conflating a debate over\nwhether land rights should be based on wartime effort, nationality or\nethnicity, or on use, occupancy or autochthony, with a deeper debate\ntaking place both within their communities and more widely across\nSouthern Sudan over perceived threats to patriclan and familial control of\nkey productive resources. Their rhetoric connects with wider vernacular\nconcerns at the monetisation and commodification of resources and rela-\ntions that were previously excluded from the money economy (cf. Shipton\n2007). Just as the buckets of blood imply the commodification of human\nlife, so the sale of land essentially involves the conversion of blood relations\ninto money, something which has been resisted or regulated in the past\n(cf. Weiss 1996: 194\u20135).\nD E B A T I N G M O N E T I S A T I O N\nOne elderly professor from Central Equatoria claimed that \u2018 this thing\nof using blood to get land only happens in the town, not in the village\u2019\n(Professor 2 int.). Southern Sudanese have long sought out the opportu-\nnities and resources of towns and government, even when this entailed\nconsiderable risk. They have also integrated money into household and\ncommunity economies, as Hutchinson (1996: 57) shows in detail for the\nNuer; there has not been a simple opposition or \u2018barrier \u2019 to conversion\nbetween cash and cattle. Yet most people still subscribe to the discourse\nthat depicts towns, government and money as an alien, exclusive and\nindividualistic economy. Lineage and family authorities have therefore\nsucceeded in retaining some control over the productive and reproductive\nresources that earn social status and capital, by resisting their straightfor-\nward commensurability with money. The paradox is not simply a disparity\nbetween discourse and practice, or ideology and reality, because the moral\ndiscourse continues to exert limits on the status of monetary wealth and to\nelicit investment in the productive economy of cattle, land and marriage.\nThis is in turn because the discourse evokes memories and experiences of\nthe volatility of the monetary economy of the urban government centres,\nleading people to convert money into more reliable and productive forms\nof value. These conversions are the focus of tensions and moral debates, as\nrevealed not only in discussion of land sales, but also of bridewealth.\nSince its colonial inception from the 1920s, the money economy has\nappeared to offer the potential for individuals to earnwealth independently,\nas well as for families to diversify their income sources. But this potential\nindependence has been restricted by marriage practices that have\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 225\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\npreserved the authority of senior male relatives over reproduction, even as\njunior men and women have often gained greater economic power than\ntheir elders (Huby 1981). As money became integrated into local and\nhousehold economies, it gradually became the main component of the\nbridewealth in certain areas. But this has been countered by the continuing\nrole of senior men in negotiating, legalising and blessing marriages, still\nmarked above all by the exchange of the non-money bridewealth com-\nponents, such as iron hoes; money is merely said to \u2018cover the hoes \u2019 to\nfacilitate their acceptance. Marriage negotiations emphasise the represen-\ntative rather than actual value of money, carefully itemised to indicate\namounts for \u2018opening the gate \u2019, or for \u2018 the father\u2019s stick\u2019, or for specific\nitems like hoes, spears or livestock (see also Reining 1966: 94). The\nappearance of a monetisation of the marriage exchange has thus been\navoided, and people criticise high monetary demands by parents as akin\nto \u2018selling their daughter \u2019, because of their blatant conversion of social,\nkinship and reproductive values directly into money.\nIn many cattle-keeping areas, even money-earning young men still re-\nmain dependent on their families to pay their cattle bridewealth, because\nthe number and cost of cattle required is too high for them to purchase; in\nother words the local economy has maintained the stronger value of cattle\nrelative to money, in favour of senior generations (cf. Ferguson 1985: 666).\nResistance to monetary bridewealth has continued up to now, as a young\nwoman near Juba explained: \u2018We can\u2019t marry with money, because all the\nbridewealth has to be shared out among the relatives. Money can be\nhidden in the pocket, but cows have to be seen! \u2019 (Pastoralist woman int.)\nMany people comment on the individualising effects of money and the\nway that it can be secretly negotiated and \u2018pocketed\u2019, thus denying and\nexcluding the wider relations of reciprocal obligation and \u2018entrustment \u2019\nthat Shipton (2007) explores in Kenya. The individualising effects and\nalternative values of urban life were the subject of Dinka songs translated\nby Mading Deng (1984: 162) which criticised the coins of the town for\ndiminishing the \u2018value \u2019 of family so that \u2018blood ties have been severed in\nthe pockets \u2019. It is not that there are two distinct money and kinship\neconomies, but rather that a moral opposition has been preserved between\nthe value of family and the value of money.\nAs well as explaining that money can too easily be hidden in the pocket\nrather than invested in social relations, people also frequently refer to\nmoney being \u2018eaten\u2019 to indicate selfish, secretive forms of consumption\n(cf. Broch-Due 1999: 59). Yet they are also quick to point out that money\nwas useless to people living in the bush during the war, because they could\nnot eat it. The frequently low purchasing power of money in general has\n226 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nensured that even money-earners have often depended on rural relatives\nfor subsistence. And wartime disruption and market shortages or collapses\nhave recurrently rendered money entirely useless, as colonial officials first\nreported in the 1940s, despairing of their efforts to promote monetisation\nand market trade (NRO 1944). In the popular imagination, the apparent\ncapacity of urban elites to \u2018eat \u2019 money is therefore mysterious and dis-\nturbing.\nIn the last decade, the exclusive and illusive nature of money (cf. Weiss\n1996: 135\u20136) has been underscored even as its use has become ever more\nwidespread, because of the often invisible international connections of\nSouthern Sudan\u2019s economy. The perceived inflation of bridewealth,\nwhether measured in cattle or money, is attributed to the dollars gained by\na new elite of government and aid agency employees, or from diaspora\nremittances :\nMarriage has been spoiled \u2026 The millions [for bridewealth] have started in\nGarang\u2019s time. During the war, there was no money; the money has increased\ndue to those boys abroad affecting us here in the country, who have no money.\nChurch elder int.\nAs refugees and IDPs return to Southern towns, increasing numbers are\ndependent on the money economy, which in turn opens up greater dif-\nferentiation between those with and without cash incomes. As in the\n1970s\u201380s, high unemployment, price inflation and limited economic ac-\ntivity disappoint the high expectations people have of urban opportunities\n(Hill 1981 ; Martin & Mosel 2011). Urban crime is blamed on enlarging\nimpoverished town populations (e.g. Mayar 2008). Around Rumbek,\npeople criticise increasing inequality and individualistic consumption\npractices in the town, as one chief explained:\nYou [the local translator] and me are not equal. The UN brought education,\nsmart clothes, so you know how to talk to foreigners, and now each person has his\nown small bowl instead of sharing from one dish. This is a new thing of the young\nmen.\nChief 3 int.\nCriticism of money and concern about the inflation of monetary bride-\nwealth is part of wider discussion about the perceived decline of a redis-\ntributive economy. An elderly widow in Rumbek similarly bemoaned the\neffects of monetary employment in eroding social obligation:\nThis is the generation of money: they don\u2019t listen to us elders, or plan for the\nfuture, or give anything to us. When we were young, our parents advised us how\nto bring cattle : boys were told how to find cattle, and girls were told to be careful\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 227\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nso they would be married well. The educated people should bring us good things,\nbut they just waste money.\nElder 1 int.\nSuch complaints belie, and perhaps produce, the reality that \u2018educated\npeople \u2019 do in fact reinvest their earnings in kinship networks and pro-\nductive resources. Nowadays a recurring topic of conversation among\nemployees of government and international agencies is the pressure they\nface from rural relatives to provide school or hospital fees, clothes and\nother commodities, and to continually disprove the suspicion that \u2018 the\neducated\u2019 are selfish, alien or, at worst, practitioners of witchcraft. Yet\neven as they seek to convert their monetary resources into the moral\neconomy of family and village, they are perpetuating the prevailing\ndichotomies by investing in the values of town in the form of school fees\nand commodity items.\nThe moral criticisms of money thus have the paradoxical effect of both\neliciting its redistribution and perpetuating its confinement to a specific\nurban value system and set of uses. Despite their relative economic power,\nmoney-earners have therefore remained marginal in the local social and\nmoral order. The expectations of their relatives are always higher than\ntheir actual earnings, and their status remains vulnerable in an economy of\nfrequently unpaid salaries. Everyone depends on money to some extent,\nand yet virtually everyone has an interest in playing down or criticising the\nimportance of money as a measure of human value.\nT U R N I N G B L O O D I N T O M O N E Y : T H E G O V E R N M E N T E C O N O M Y\nThe contrasts that many Southern Sudanese draw between money and\nkinship values are particularly apparent when they discuss compensation\nfor human life. Even more than with bridewealth, people have resisted a\nmonetisation of blood-compensation payments, because of the implication\nthat \u2018 it is selling your brother\u2019 (Chief 1 int.). Where possible, cattle are\ngiven as blood-wealth because they are seen as productive of human life\nand social relations (Mading Deng 1998; Hutchinson 1996) ; otherwise,\npeople have largely refused to accept blood-money in the belief that it\ninstead brings disease and pollution into the family (Retired politician 2\nint. ; Moro, pers. comm. 2010; Nalder 1937: 43\u20135; NRO 1943\u20135). This is\nwhy the commodification of human life in \u2018buckets of blood\u2019 is such\na potent rhetorical device. And \u2013 even if unintentionally \u2013 it is revealing of\na transethnic popular perception of the effects of war and a shared mem-\nory of the \u2018government\u2019 economy that stretches back to the brutally\n228 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nextractive commercial and military incursions of the nineteenth century.\nHuman life appears to have been commodified on a vast scale by the\neconomy of the recent war, from which the top military officers are\ncommonly believed to have profited. But this evokes a longer history of\nthe apparent capacity of government to extract and consume productive\nresources, or, in the bluntest formulation, to turn blood into money.\nThe cultures of the army and towns trace their origins to the nineteenth-\ncentury military stations (zara\u2019ib ; sing. zariba) of ivory- and slave-traders\nand the Turco-Egyptian government (Johnson 1992). Described as \u2018para-\nsitic \u2019 on the surrounding countryside, the zara \u2019ib and Egyptian garrisons\ndepended on raiding the population for ivory, slaves and cattle. Local\npeople drawn into their orbit were themselves turned into slaves, soldiers\nor raiders (Gessi 1892: 84\u20135). Schweinfurth (1873 II : 427) categorised the\nzariba inhabitants as \u2018consumers\u2019 and the surrounding population as\n\u2018producers \u2019, a distinction which has endured in perceptions of urban\neconomies ; contrasts are still drawn between shared and ordered con-\nsumption practices within families, and the greedy, selfish consumption of\ngovernment and townspeople. Schweinfurth (1873 I : 92; II : 169) also\ncommented on the \u2018enormous consumption\u2019 of raided cattle in the zara \u2019ib.\nThe original cattle-owners would only have killed their cattle for con-\nsumption during famine, and it is still commonly considered shameful\neven to sell cattle in order to purchase food.\nThe predatory and extractive character of nineteenth-century com-\nmercial and military incursions remains powerful in Southern Sudanese\nmemory. One elder from Central Equatoria linked the recent bloodshed\nof the war to this longer history: \u2018The blood has never stopped ever since\nthe Turks came and captured people \u2026 and sold them as slaves \u2026 The\nblood did not stop so this is just another phase, and the blood goes on\n(Elder 2 int.). Another interviewee from the same area based his assertion\nof primary land rights on a long history of defending the land against\ngovernment appropriation: \u2018This land, we have poured blood for it from\nour great, great-grandfathers ; since the Mahdiyya and Turkiyya, we have\npoured blood \u2026 to protect the land\u2019 (Professor 1 int.).\nThe colonial administrations of the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium of\nSudan and the short-lived Belgian Lado Enclave appeared little different\nfrom their predecessors, launching their own raids to exact \u2018 tribute \u2019\nfrom the population. One British report on the Lado Enclave declared\nthat the inhabitants \u2018are sick to death of the blood-sucking that has been\ngoing on \u2026 the natives are beginning to realise that everything is being\ntaken out of their country and nothing new substituted\u2019 (NRO 1905). Over\ntime the \u2018blood-sucking\u2019 became less literal, but the British colonial\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 229\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\ngovernment continued to extract resources and labour from rural econ-\nomies.\nSoldiers and government employees began to form urban settlements\naround the government stations, which in turn attracted individuals from\nthe surrounding area. But colonial administrators and local people alike\nviewed these emerging urban populations with mistrust and derision,\nthe British seeing them as dangerously \u2018detribalised\u2019, and local society\nassociating them with theft, vice and dishonesty \u2013 in other words as stand-\ning outside the rural moral communities. Recruitment of individuals into\ngovernment employment, education and army would continue to involve\ntheir perceived extraction from kinship society and transformation into a\ntown or \u2018educated\u2019 person: \u2018All our educated boys \u2026 go to town and stay\nthere \u2019 (Golooba-Mutebi & Mapuor 2005; see also Hutchinson 1996;\nCormack 2010).\nThe economy of the urban government centres also became firmly as-\nsociated with money, particularly as the colonial administration demanded\ntaxes in cash; in Dinka the word for money, weu, is the same as for taxes\n(NRO c. 1939). As one chief near Yei stated simply, \u2018money belongs to the\nGovernment\u2019 (Chief 4 int.). Or, as Blunt (2004: 321) declares in the case\nof Kenya, \u2018money is the ubiquitous and unavoidable symbol of the state \u2019.\nIn Southern Sudan this association has been reinforced by the very limited\ncommercial development and continuing dominance of the economy by\nthe public sector (Cook 2008; Hill 1981). Government (and, more recently,\ninternational agency) employment has been the main source of monetary\nincome since the colonial period.Commercial success has tended to depend\non access to markets and finance beyond Southern Sudan, giving\nKhartoum or Ugandan traders an advantage over local traders. National\ndevelopment has meanwhile focused on appropriating land for mech-\nanised agriculture in the north-south border areas, or extracting natural\nresources \u2013 most recently, and profitably, oil.\nThis history of marginalisation and extractive government was the main\njustification for the SPLA rebellion from 1983. But Southern Sudanese\noften interpret the war as a struggle among government people \u2013 the \u2018war\nof the educated\u2019 (Hutchinson 2001: 320) \u2013 driven by hunger for money.\nAlthough the SPLA was distinguished from the Khartoum government as\nthe government \u2018of the bush\u2019 or \u2018of our sons\u2019, its vernacular nomenclature\nremained the same, denoting foreign and military origins (Leonardi\n2007a). In popular discussion of the causes of war, money is again ascribed\na power of its own to corrupt and to destroy relations of kinship: \u2018Even if\nyou are brothers then you kill each other. Because of money, we are told to\nfight. We are eating money, and this is the cause which brought war\u2019\n230 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\n(Teacher 1 int.). Inhabitants of the government garrison town of Juba\nsimilarly blamed money for tempting people into informing on their own\nrelatives and friends to security forces, so that \u2018 the collaborators ate our\nblood\u2019 (Badiey, pers. comm. 2008; Elder 3 int.).\nThe profits of war are often described as \u2018blood-money\u2019 in a conflation\nof an international idiom with the indigenous dislike of monetary blood-\ncompensation (e.g. Gordon 2009). One story recounted in Wau tells of a\nShilluk military officer who allegedly received compensation from the\nKhartoum government for civilians killed in his home area during the war,\nwhose relatives had refused to accept blood-money. The officer is said to\nhave died subsequently, because of \u2018eating their blood\u2019 (Returnee int.).\nAnother man in Wau explained that \u2018our people thought that if you kill\nmy brother and give me a lot of money and I accept, then what I eat is like\neating the blood of my brother \u2019 (Politician 3 int.).\nThe equations drawn between money, blood and eating in such stories\nsuggest that money is seen to mediate the consumption of the blood of the\npeople, with potentially dangerous spiritual consequences. In other African\ncountries, the mysteries and falsities of neo-liberal capitalism have been\nexpressed in popular accounts of individuals who could turn human blood\ninto money (Apter 2005: 251; Blunt 2004; Weiss 1996: 202\u20137). There\nare parallels in Southern Sudanese accounts of occult wealth-generation\n(Kibego 2005; Leonardi 2007b). But the conversion of blood into money\ndoes not necessarily require such supernatural powers, in the context of\nthe recent war.\nLike the nineteenth-century military economy, the war since 1983\nalienated productive resources and human life from the rural areas and\nlineage control on a massive scale, not least through the conscription of\nyoung soldiers (Leonardi 2007c). Military commanders also encouraged\nraiding for cattle and the \u2018steady siphoning\u2019 of civilian assets into their\nhands (Jok & Hutchinson 1999: 133; Walraet 2008). Johnson (2003: 166)\ndescribes the \u2018highly individualised economic policy \u2019 of the SPLM\/A,\nwhose leaders were able to \u2018 strike deals of their own\u2019, and control the\nexport trade in livestock, timber and minerals. As in the nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries, the primary role of chiefs reverted to provi-\nsioning armies with food and recruits in order to deflect worse depreda-\ntions: \u2018We collect a lot of money and food for the government but we get\nnothing in return \u2026 these things go into the stomach of a crocodile \u2019\n(Rumbek chief, cited in Golooba-Mutebi & Mapuor 2005).\nThere are commonly recounted tales of military officers who gorged\nthemselves on entire goats during the war, while their bodyguards\nwatched hungrily. This is a vivid caricature of unproductive patronage,\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 231\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nand the kind of individualistic consumption associated more generally\nwith the money economy and the government. Such behaviour would\nhave set the officers \u2018outside the consumption patterns \u2019 of the local\ncivilians from whom they seized the goats (cf. Alexander & McGregor\n2005: 81\u20132).\nApter\u2019s (2005: 273) description of Nigeria as a \u2018vampire state \u2019, \u2018 in which\nthe production of false value equals the consumption of human blood\u2019,\ninvites obvious comparison with Southern Sudanese discourse. Since\n2005, the frequently observed lack of any constructive manifestation of the\nanticipated peace dividend, the flimsiness of the elite economy of tent-\nhotels, and the instability of salaries, banks and currency, seemed to\nepitomise the false value of the government economy.15 A particularly\ndramatic allegory was reported in 2008, when a vulture vomited \u2018a litre \u2019 \u2013\nanother commodity measure \u2013 of blood right next to a state governor\u2019s\noffice and its flags. The local news reporter noted that vultures feed on\nflesh, including that of humans, and that the Sudanese national coat of\narms features a vulture, before quoting people on the streets who were\ninterpreting the unusual event to mean \u2018end of suffering\u2019. According to a\nlocal student, \u2018 this bird used to feed on our blood while struggling in the\nbush. It is now regretting and that is why it has to come and vomit the\nblood it took from innocent people \u2019 (Biar 2008). The Sudanese state,\nwhose national symbol of a secretary bird is here \u2013 mistakenly but aptly \u2013\nbelieved to be a vulture, has proven less regretful.\nBeneath any competition between ethnic groups, returnees, soldiers and\ncivilians to claim the greatest right to the \u2018peace dividend\u2019, there is a core\nconcern with the perceived extraction and consumption of human life and\nproductive resources by the forces of government(s) during the war, and\nwith the historical patterns this evokes. The predatory nature of the\ngovernment economy since the nineteenth century has been a pretext for\npeople to create rural refuges from it and to preserve alternative economic\nand social structures (cf. Giblin 2005). But the seizure of land in Equatoria\nseems to represent the expansion and penetration of the predatory\ngovernment economy into these rural economies. One chief responded\nangrily to reports that land in his rural chiefdom was being taken by\nsoldiers of a prominent Southern militia leader : \u2018How can these brothers\nof ours just take land like that? At least the Arabs just stayed in their\nbarracks and didn\u2019t try to take land\u2019 (Chief 2 int.). The desire to keep\nthe predatory economy of government confined to its barracks is a long-\nstanding one, but Southern Sudanese have found a new language in\nrecent years in which to criticise government: the international discourse\nof \u2018corruption\u2019.\n232 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nS T A T E , K I N A N D T H E R O O T S O F C O R R U P T I O N\nIn the aftermath of war and continuing uncertainties of the peace process,\npopular criticism of the vulture-like tendencies of government is tempered\nby the strong desire for self-determination in Southern Sudan, understood\nin simple terms as gaining independence from the \u2018enemy\u2019 in Khartoum.\nNevertheless, there has been growing criticism of GoSS corruption, voiced\neverywhere from the cattle-camps and tea shops to the newspapers and\nparliaments.16 This paper attempts an analysis, not of the veracity or\nextent of corruption, but rather of some of the popular discourse about it,\nwhich focuses on the \u2018eating\u2019 of government money, and the nepotism\nand tribalism by which the majority of people feel excluded from access\nto government offices and resources.\nAt first glance these are familiar litanies of corruption. They correspond\nto wider analyses of African governance and politics that stress patri-\nmonialism as a systemwith its own socio-cultural logic andmoral economy,\nwhich is in turn a much-mutated version of indigenous, deep-rooted pol-\nitical cultures. The reciprocal obligation between patron and client at the\ncore of these cultures is said to have been denied and distorted in the\nneopatrimonialism of the post-colonial state, leading to the widespread\npopular condemnation of corruption. Nevertheless, some analysts argue,\nthere is a replication of vernacular political culture and the relations of\nhousehold and village at the level of the state (Bayart 1993; Berman 2004;\nChabal 2009; Chabal & Daloz 1999; Olivier de Sardan 1999).17 De Waal\n(2009) argues for the applicability of Bayart\u2019s analysis to Sudan, particularly\nin terms of the compatibility of lineage and state, and \u2018 the way in which\nformal political systems and processes are intermingled with kinship\u2019.\nIt is easy to see reported corruption in Southern Sudan in these terms,\nas indicating the demands on government people to redistribute state re-\nsources through networks of kinship and ethnicity. But the moral concerns\napparent in the debates over land are also present in popular discourse on\ngovernment corruption, and they actually suggest quite the opposite :\nkinship and state are fundamentally distinct moral worlds, even if they are\nincreasingly connected in everyday practice. As we have seen, the state\nand the monetary economy with which it is so strongly associated have\nalways been understood to operate in remote moral ways. People have\ntherefore resisted the \u2018over-monetisation\u2019 of \u2018everyday forms of sociability \u2019,\nwhich Olivier de Sardan (1999: 45) highlights as a facilitator of corruption.\nThey draw frequent attention to the large bellies of the big men not as a\nproductive source of patronage but as a caricature of the unproductive\nconsumption with which government and the urban money economy are\nassociated. This ensures that while patronage may be an important form\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 233\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nof rural\u2013urban and state\u2013society linkage, the status of government patrons\nin rural society is simultaneously limited by the moral condemnation of the\nsource of their wealth and the nature of their consumption.\nGoSS explains its major expenditure on civil service and army salaries\nin terms of the need to reward its soldiers and civilian supporters (Cook\n2008: 70). However, the ambivalence with which people view the state and\nits economy ensures that even this form of government patronage is fre-\nquently interpreted as part of a wider, unwelcome, expansion of the state,\nblamed for the greater inequality and individualisation discussed above,\nand for an escalation of local conflicts. Many Southern Sudanese people\nare adamant that increasing conflicts since 2005 \u2013 too often labelled\nas \u2018 tribalist \u2019 \u2013 are the result of political instigation or a new economy of\ncattle raids and trade controlled by military officers, so that \u2018 tribal political\nvultures would like conflict to continue\u2019 (Vuni 2007; see Billy 2005;\nWalraet 2008). Similarly, a young man in Rumbek asserted that SPLA\nofficers were profiting from sales of arms and raided cattle, with a par-\nticularly blunt formulation of the monetisation of human life and kinship\nvalues : \u2018The blood of your brother becomes your own money. These\npeople are like vultures \u2019 (Teacher 2 int.).\nParadoxically, pressure to pay bridewealth in cattle may also be fuelling\nraids (cf. Broch-Due 1999: 85), but the prevailing discourse blames com-\nmodification and political elites. As a recent report also illustrates, rural\npeople perceive \u2018 tribalism\u2019 as something brought by the government\npeople from the towns and offices, and associated with the intensifying\ncommercialisation of cattle, another form of unprecedented monetisation\n(Schomerus & Allen 2010). Similarly Bari chiefs attribute the politicisation\nof land disputes in Juba to the Bari \u2018politicians and intellectuals \u2019 (Deng\n2010: 32).\nThe recent popular concerns in Southern Sudan about both land and\ncorruption \u2013 often expressed in terms of blood being turned into money \u2013\nare a manifestation of long-standing ambivalent relations with the state, in\nwhich people seek to make claims on the state\u2019s resources, but simul-\ntaneously resist its intrusion into their social relations and local economies\nbecause they fear its extractive tendencies. When Equatorians decry the\nnotion that their land can be bought with the blood of soldiers, they are\nnot only asserting antecedent land rights against other ethnic groups. At a\ndeeper level of moral concern, they are resisting the appropriation of the\nproductive resource of land into the market economy and the penetration\nof the military and monetary cultures of government and army into the\nrural refuges of kinship and productive relations. In this respect it is the\nunprecedented closer proximity of the state to society since the SPLA war\n234 CHERRY L EONARD I\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\nthat is arousing such unease, but this is understood not as the capture of\nthe state by local cultures and relations, but as the intrusion of the immoral\nways of the government into local society.\n: : :\nWhen the late leader of the SPLM\/A, Dr John Garang, promised to \u2018 take\nthe towns to the people \u2019, he meant to extend service delivery to the rural\nareas. In 2007 one county commissioner claimed to take up this call by\ninviting visiting GoSS officials \u2018deeper into his village\u2019, where he \u2018planted\nthe Southern Sudan flag into the ground\u2019 (Diyan 2007). But the attempt to\nplant the state beyond its old urban centres is generating deep tensions\nbetween value systems that have historically been kept separate in moral\nterms. In the absence of the promised rural service delivery, many people\nhave instead taken themselves to the town, following a long tradition\nof seeking to access and appropriate the resources of the state and the\nassociated monetary urban economy. But they have also continued to\nsubscribe to a discourse which warns of the capacity of this economy to\nremove individuals altogether from their social and moral communities\nand drive them into selfish and potentially rapacious modes of existence.\nIn order to resist this process, people have therefore continued to invest in\nan alternative, productive and kinship-based, economy and social status\nassociated with rural communities, even if they are living in the towns.\nAnd they are simultaneously resisting the expansion and encroachment of\nthe towns into these alternative value systems.\nIn this context, the debates over alleged claims to Equatorian land on\nthe basis of buckets of blood poured on it during the war also contain\ncommentary on broader economic processes and ultimately on the state\nitself. Firstly, competition for land around Equatorian towns is perceived\nas indicating the wider expansion and penetration of urban, military and\nmonetary forces into the rural areas, threatening to appropriate and\ncommodify communal land. Secondly, the very notion of blood in buckets\nraises the disturbing implication of the commodification of human life\nitself, a process historically associated with the same economy in which\ngovernment and military have their roots. Condemnation of the con-\nsumption and monetisation of human blood during and since the war is\nshared across ethnic and livelihood divides.\nOver a decade ago, Tripp (1997: 172) emphasised the peculiar resilience\nof the political structures of state and society in Sudan:\nThis should serve as a warning to anyone who thinks either that the attitudes\nwhich have historically been associated with those structures can be changed\nMORA L D E B A T E S I N S OUTHERN SUD AN 235\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 25 May 2011 IP address: 129.234.252.67\novernight, or that a formal change in the constitutional rules of the game can\nredress the imbalances at the heart of the Sudanese state project.\nSouthern Sudanese discourse reveals a common awareness of just this\nresilience: however hopeful they are of a potential independent state,\nSouthern Sudanese also perceive their current government in the context\nof the historical patterns from which it has emerged. This might seem\na pessimistic note to strike now as Southern Sudan looks forward to\na popular referendum and potential independence. But much recent\ncommentary has also been pessimistic, and it has directed greatest criti-\ncism at so-called \u2018 tribal \u2019 divisions and conflicts, and at the generalised\n\u2018corruption\u2019 of the new government. The problem for Southern Sudan is\nnot, however, primarily one of ethnicity, nor of the patrimonial demands\nof indigenous social and cultural norms. It is an enduring problem of the\ngovernment economy. The military project that has produced the new\ngovernment was ostensibly a struggle to overturn the entrenched pattern\nof an extractive, centralising and remote state. But from the popular per-\nspective, the decades of war instead expanded and intensified those pat-\nterns, turning the blood of the people into money to be consumed in selfish\nways. Collective memories in Southern Sudan suggest that the roots of the\ngovernment economy are to be found in the nineteenth-century zariba, not\nin the village. Understanding the resulting ambivalence that people feel\ntowards towns, money and the state is vital in order to move beyond the\nprevalent fixation with ethnic divisions in Southern Sudan. It is in the\ncommon desire to protect the social relations and productive economy of\nfamily, village and cattle-camp from the expanding, corrupting forces of\npredatory government that a shared Southern Sudanese culture and\nmemory is most apparent.\nN O T E S\n1.
