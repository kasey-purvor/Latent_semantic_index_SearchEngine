This\ncomprises nine XMM\u2013Newton pointings in the North Galactic Pole region (\u223c1.6 deg2) and\noverlaps with the SDSS, 2QZ and 2dFGRS surveys. Our sources contribute about 50 per\ncent of the 2\u201310 keV X-ray background down to the flux limit of 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. The\nhardness ratio distribution of the sample suggests a deficit of heavily absorbed sources. A\nspectral fit to the coadded total source spectrum yields a steep photon index, \u0005 = 1.83+0.04\u22120.05.\nAll but eight sources have optical counterparts down to the SDSS photometric limit of\nr \u2248 22.5. Spectroscopic identifications exist for 34 sources. The vast majority (24 sources)\nare associated with broad-line (BL) active galactic nuclei (AGN), while only seven present\nnarrow or no emission lines. Five sources are probably associated with Galactic stars. Finally,\nwe present photometric redshifts for another 17 probable AGN. The combined spectrum of\nthe 24 spectroscopically identified BL AGN is steep (\u0005 = 2.02+0.04\u22120.05), while that of the seven\nAGN that do not present broad lines is flatter, with \u0005 = 1.64+0.11\u22120.11. The spectrum of the eight\noptically unidentified sources is flat with \u0005 \u2248 1.1. Spectral fits to the individual BL AGN reveal\nlarge absorption (rest-frame column density >1022 cm\u22122) in only two cases. The individual\nspectra of the narrow-line AGN present significant evidence for even a moderate absorption\n(3 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122) in only one case.\nKey words: galaxies: active \u2013 quasars: general \u2013 X-rays: general.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nDeep Chandra surveys have resolved the bulk of the X-ray back-\nground in both the soft and the hard energy ranges (Mushotzky et al.\n2000; Brandt 2001; Giaconni et al. 2002; Alexander et al. 2003).\nThese surveys detect a heterogeneous population of sources consist-\ning of a mixture of (i) broad-line active galactic nuclei (BL AGN)\n(quasi-stellar objects and type 1 Seyfert galaxies), (ii) narrow-\nline active galactic nuclei (NL AGN), (iii) \u2018passive\u2019 galaxies with\nabsorption-line optical spectra and (iv) optically faint sources (I >\n24 mag). It is likely that both the \u2018passive\u2019 galaxies and the optically\nfaint sources may be associated with obscured active galactic nuclei\n(see e.g. Moran, Filippenko & Chornock 2002; Fiore et al. 2003).\nNevertheless, deep Chandra observations primarily probe the faint\n\u0002E-mail: ig@astro.noa.gr\n(<10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121) X-ray population. At brighter fluxes (>10\u221215\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121) Chandra is limited by its small field of view (0.07\ndeg2) and cannot provide large samples. However, it is these bright\nsources that dominate the X-ray background (XRB) (>50 per cent,\ne.g. Boyle et al. 1998). Therefore, to improve our understanding\nof the sources that make up the XRB, wide-area relatively shallow\nsurveys are essential.\nXMM\u2013Newton, with its large field of view, high effective area\nand good positional accuracy, provides a step forward in the study\nof these sources. In this paper, we present the X-ray spectral proper-\nties of sources detected in a shallow XMM\u2013Newton survey covering\na \u223c1.6 deg2 area near the North Galactic Pole region. In particular,\nwe concentrate on the hard X-ray-selected sample (2\u20138 keV), as\nthese are more typical of the sources contributing to the XRB with\nits energy density peaking at 30\u201340 keV. Although extensive sur-\nveys have been conducted at these energies by both the ASCA and\nBeppoSAX missions (e.g. Georgantopoulos et al. 1997; Ueda et al.\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n92 I. Georgantopoulos et al.\n1998; Giommi, Perri & Fiore 2000), the poor spatial resolution ham-\npered the identification of the optical counterparts. The present data\nprobe a factor of \u22484 fainter fluxes than the deepest ASCA survey\n(Georgantopoulos et al. 1997) with an order of magnitude better\npositional accuracy.\nIn this paper we adopt H 0 = 65 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121, q 0 = 0.3 and\n\b = 0.7.\n2 X M M \u2013 N E W TO N \/ 2 D F S U RV E Y OV E RV I E W\nThe X-ray sample used in the present study is compiled from the\nXMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey. This is a wide-area (\u223c4 deg2), shallow\n(2\u201310 ks per pointing) survey carried out by the XMM\u2013Newton\nnear the North and South Galactic Pole regions. The data reduc-\ntion, source extraction, flux estimation and catalogue generation are\ndescribed in detail by Georgakakis et al. (2003, 2004). In the present\nstudy we concentrate on the North Galactic Pole F864 region. This is\nbecause of the wealth of follow-up observations (optical photometry\nand spectroscopy) available for these fields.\nThe XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey F864 region overlaps with the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). The SDSS is\nan on-going imaging and spectroscopic survey that aims to cover\nabout 10 000 deg2 of the sky. Photometry is performed in five bands\n(ugriz; Fukugita et al. 1996; Stoughton et al. 2002) to the limit-\ning magnitude g \u2248 23 mag, providing a uniform and homogeneous\nmulticolour photometric catalogue. The SDSS spectroscopic obser-\nvations will obtain spectra for over one million objects, including\ngalaxies brighter than r = 17.7 mag, luminous red galaxies to z \u2248\n0.45 and colour-selected quasi-stellar objects (QSOs; York et al.\n2000; Stoughton et al. 2002). In the present study we use data from\nthe Early Data Release (EDR; Stoughton et al. 2002).\nIn addition to the SDSS, the F864 region overlaps with the re-\ncently completed 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey1 (2dFGRS; Colless\net al. 2001) and the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey2 (2QZ; Croom et al.\n2001). Both the 2dFGRS and 2QZ are large-scale spectroscopic\ncampaigns that fully exploit the capabilities of the 2dF multifibre\nspectrograph on the 4-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). These\nprojects provide high-quality spectra, redshifts and spectral classi-\nfications for 220 000 bJ < 19.4 mag galaxies and 23 000 optically\nselected bJ < 20.85 mag QSOs. Moreover, the central region of the\nF864 survey have been observed by the ROSAT satellite (Shanks\net al. 1991; Georgantopoulos et al. 1996).\n3 T H E X - R AY DATA\nThe EPIC (European Photon Imaging Camera; Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001;\nTurner et al. 2001) cameras were operated in full-frame mode with\nthe thin filter applied. The XMM\u2013Newton data have been analysed\nusing the Science Analysis Software (SAS 5.3). Event files for the PN\nand the two MOS detectors have been produced using the EPCHAIN\nand EMCHAIN tasks of SAS respectively. The event files were screened\nfor high particle background periods by rejecting periods with 0.5\u2013\n10 keV count rates higher than 25 and 15 count s\u22121 for the PN\nand the two MOS cameras, respectively. These criteria exclude one\nfield (F864\u20134) from the analysis that suffered from significantly\nelevated and flaring particle background. The resulting area covered\nby the survey is 1.6 deg2. The PN and MOS good time intervals\nfor the remaining pointings are shown in Table 1. The differences\n1 http:\/\/msowww.anu.edu.au\/2dFGRS\/\n2 http:\/\/www.2dfquasar.org\nTable 1.

Only events corresponding\nto patterns 0\u20134 for the PN and 0\u201312 for MOS have been kept.\nIn order to increase the signal-to-noise (S\/N) ratio and to reach\nfainter fluxes, the PN and the MOS event files have been combined\ninto a single event list using the MERGE task of SAS. Images have been\nextracted in the spectral bands 0.5\u20138 (total), 0.5\u20132 (soft) and 2\u20138 keV\n(hard) for both the merged and the individual PN and MOS event\nfiles. We use the more sensitive (higher S\/N ratio) merged image for\nsource extraction and flux estimation, while the individual PN and\nMOS images are used to calculate hardness ratios. This is because\nthe interpretation of hardness ratios is simplified if the extracted\ncount rates are from one detector only. Exposure maps accounting\nfor vignetting, charge-coupled device (CCD) gaps and bad pixels\nhave been constructed for each spectral band. In the present study\nthe source detection is performed on the 2\u20138 keV image using the\nEWAVELET task of SAS with a detection threshold of 6\u03c3 . A total of\n61 X-ray sources have been detected to the limit f X(2\u20138 keV) \u2248\n10\u221214 erg s\u22121cm\u22122. Integration of the log N\u2013log S derived by Baldi\net al. (2002) to the above flux limit shows that about 50 per cent of\nthe XRB is resolved at these energies.\nCount rates in the merged (PN + MOS) images as well as the\nindividual PN and MOS images are estimated within an 18 arcsec\naperture. For the background estimation we use the background\nmaps generated as a by-product of the EWAVELET task of SAS. A\nsmall fraction of sources lie close to masked regions (CCD gaps\nor hot pixels) on either the MOS or the PN detectors. This may\nintroduce errors in the estimated source counts. To avoid this bias,\nthe source count rates (and hence the hardness ratios and the flux)\nare estimated using the detector (MOS or PN) with no masked pixels\nin the vicinity of the source.\nWe convert counts to flux assuming a power-law spectrum with\n\u0005 = 1.7 and Galactic absorption N H = 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 appro-\npriate for the F864 fields (Dickey & Lockman 1990). Note that a\n\u0005 = 1.7 photon index provides a reasonable representation of the\ntypical source spectrum, being intermediate between the steep BL\nAGN and the unidentified flatter sources (see Section 5.3). The mean\nECF for the mosaic of all three detectors is estimated by weighting\nthe ECFs of individual detectors by the respective exposure time. For\nthe encircled energy correction, accounting for the energy fraction\noutside the aperture within which source counts are accumulated,\nwe adopt the calibration given by the XMM\u2013Newton Calibration\nDocumentation.3 These studies use both PN and MOS observations\n3 http:\/\/xmm.vilspa.esa.es\/external\/xmm sw cal\/calib\/documentation.shtml\n#XRT\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 352, 91\u2013100\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nX-ray spectral properties of hard X-ray sources 93\nof point sources to formulate the XMM\u2013Newton point spread func-\ntion (PSF) for different energies and off-axis angles. In particular, a\nKing profile is fitted to the data with parameters that are a function\nof both energy and off-axis angle.\n4 T H E O P T I C A L C O U N T E R PA RT S\nThe SDSS optical photometric catalogue is used to identify the\nhard selected sample optically by estimating the probability P that\na given candidate is chance coincidence (Downes et al. 1986). Of\nthe 61 hard X-ray sources, we propose 49 candidate optical identifi-\ncations with P < 0.015; eight sources have no optical counterpart,\nand four sources have a probability higher than 0.015 of being spu-\nrious and thus they are less secure identifications. The probability\ndepends both on the separation of the optical counterpart from the\nX-ray centroid and on the surface density of the optical sources at\nthe given magnitude (see Georgakakis et al. 2004, for details). To\nestimate the fraction of spurious identifications in our sample, we\nrandomize the X-ray source positions and re-estimate the number\nof optical counterparts. This is repeated 100 times. We find a spuri-\nous identification rate of \u22486 per cent or about four spurious optical\ncounterparts out of the 61 sources.\nThe catalogue of the X-ray sources is given in Table 2. Optical\nspectroscopic information is available for 34 out of the 61 sources.\nThese contribute about 30 per cent of the XRB in the 2\u20138 keV en-\nergy band. A total of 21 sources have redshifts and optical clas-\nsifications from our own spectroscopic campaign using the 2dF\n(Georgantopoulos et al., in preparation). The remaining sources\nhave spectroscopic data from the 2QZ, 2dFGRS and SDSS surveys.\nThe spectroscopically identified sample comprises: (i) 24 sources\nwith broad optical emission lines (BL AGN); (ii) five sources with\nnarrow lines (NL); (iii) two sources with absorption lines (AL);4\nand (iv) three stars \u2013 note that closer inspection of the (low S\/N\nratio) spectrum of source #2, which is classified as a star by the\n2QZ survey, leaves open the possibility that this is associated with\na galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.243. We also note that two additional\nsources for which no spectroscopic information is available (#1 and\n#26) are candidate stars on the basis of their low f X\/ f o ratio and\noptical colours (for the latter see e.g. Hatziminaoglou, Mathez &\nPello 2000). In addition to the spectroscopic redshifts, we have esti-\nmated photometric redshifts, using the multiwaveband coverage of\nthe SDSS, for six X-ray sources that are most probably QSOs as they\nhave point-like optical profile and high X-ray to optical flux ratio.\nThe photometric redshift technique is fully described in Hatzimi-\nnaoglou et al. (2000) and Kitsionas et al. (in preparation). Note that\npoint-like sources with a determined photometric redshift of z < 0.4\nare likely to present large uncertainties in their redshift (Kitsionas\net al., in preparation). For 11 sources (#4, 6, 13, 14, 15, 18, 22, 24,\n46, 47, 60) that are optically extended (most also have red colours),\nwe have used the photometric redshifts provided by SDSS, which\nare based on galaxy templates (Csabai et al. 2003).\nAs a fraction of the spectroscopic identifications come from the\n2QZ survey, there may be a bias towards the detection of a high\nnumber of QSOs among our identified sources. We plot the col-\numn density and flux distributions, in order to understand further\nany possible biases introduced. The observer\u2019s-frame column den-\nsity is derived from the hardness ratios as described in Section 5.1.\nIndeed, from Fig. 1, we see that the unidentified sources are in\n4 As all the NL\/AL objects have luminosities in excess of 1042 erg s\u22121, these\nare most probably AGN.\ngeneral harder. This is not surprising as many of our optical iden-\ntifications are based on the SDSS and 2QZ surveys, which are\ndesigned to detect ultraviolet (UV) excess selected QSOs, most\nof which do not show strong absorption in X-rays. In Fig. 2, we\npresent the flux distribution, again separating the spectroscopically\nidentified and the unidentified sources. Both the spectroscopically\nidentified and unidentified sources appear to sample the whole flux\nrange. However, at the faintest flux bin, there are more unidentified\nsources.\nIn Fig. 3 we plot the redshift distribution of the BL (24) and\nAL\/NL (seven) AGN. The NL AGN are preferably detected at low\nredshift in agreement with the findings of other hard X-ray surveys\n(e.g. Brusa et al. 2003). Fig. 4 shows the colour\u2013colour plot for the\noptically identified hard X-ray sources. A striking result from this\nfigure is the significant number of red (g \u2212 r > 0.5) sources with\nextended optical profiles suggesting relatively low-z galaxies. Fig. 4\nsuggests that these sources are a non-negligible mode of the hard\nX-ray-selected population to the limit of our survey.\n5 X - R AY S P E C T R A L A NA LY S I S\n5.1 Hardness ratios\nIn Fig. 5 we plot the hardness ratio as a function of flux. The column\ndensities are derived from the observed hardness ratio using the\nPIMMS software assuming a power-law spectrum with \u0005 = 1.9. Error\nbars correspond to the 68 per cent confidence level. For clarity we\nplot the error bars only in the cases where the source contains more\nthan five net counts in both energy bands. As previously explained\nin Section 3, the hardness ratios are estimated from either the MOS\nor the PN detectors. As the MOS has a lower effective area at low\nenergies, compared to the PN, the same hardness ratio corresponds\nto different X-ray spectral properties (e.g. \u0005, N H).\nIn Fig. 5 we also plot the lines corresponding to an absorbing col-\numn of N H = 1021 and 1022 cm\u22122, assuming a power-law spectrum\nwith a photon index of \u0005 = 1.9 for the MOS and PN. Note that\nthe lines for the MOS and the PN are identical for high absorbing\ncolumns N H > 5 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122. Although the sources span a large\nrange of hardness ratios, most cluster around soft values: the aver-\nage hardness ratio corresponds to a spectrum N H \u223c 3 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122\n(for \u0005 = 1.9).\nThe observer\u2019s-frame column density distribution was presented\nin Fig. 1. The column densities estimated there represent only a\nlower limit to the true, rest-frame column densities. The rest-frame\ncolumn density is higher than that in the observer\u2019s frame as the k-\neffect shifts the absorption turnover at lower energies. The relation\nbetween the intrinsic rest-frame and the observer\u2019s-frame column\ndensity scales approximately as (1 + z)2.7 (Barger et al. 2002). The\nGalactic column density of 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 has been subtracted be-\nfore applying the above correction. In Fig. 6 (upper panel) we show\nthe rest-frame column density distribution for the 31 AGN that have\na spectroscopic redshift: the unshaded and the hatched histograms\nrepresent the BL and NL\/AL AGN respectively. It appears that there\nis a small fraction of heavily absorbed (N H > 1022 cm\u22122) BL AGN.\nIn the whole sample, there are 11 sources whose 90 per cent lower\nlimit of the hardness ratio corresponds to an observer\u2019s-frame col-\numn density N H > 1021 cm\u22122. Two of them are spectroscopically\nidentified as BL AGN, while one source is most probably a BL AGN\non the basis of its stellar-like optical morphology and high f X\/ f o\nratio. Interestingly, the majority of the NL AGN present soft hard-\nness ratios, i.e. low column densities, consistent with the Galactic\nvalue. However, as the hardness ratio analysis provides only a rough\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 352, 91\u2013100\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n94 I.

For\nthe X-ray spectral analysis the source counts are extracted using a\nradius of 18 arcsec. The background spectrum is estimated from\nimage regions free from sources. Response matrices and auxiliary\nfiles are generated using the SAS tasks RMFGEN and ARFGEN, respec-\ntively. Spectral fits use the XSPEC v11.2 software. The quoted errors\ncorrespond to the 90 per cent confidence level.\nFirst, we attempt to constrain the intrinsic column densities of the\nthree BL AGN above, via proper spectral fitting, using the XSPEC\nsoftware. We perform the spectral fitting in the 0.3\u20138 keV band\nwhere the instrument calibration is well known. As our sources are\nfaint, we use the C statistic (Cash 1979), which does not require the\nbinning of the data. However, the C statistic does not allow for the\nderivation of the goodness-of-fit probability, unlike the \u03c72 statistic.\nWe fit a power-law model absorbed by the Galactic column (N H =\n2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122) and an additional intrinsic column density. The\npower-law slope is fixed to \u0005 = 1.9 with the only free parameters\nbeing the normalization and the intrinsic column density. The results\nare presented in Table 3.

About 15 of the 61 sources either lie close to\ngaps or bad pixels on the PN or are outside the PN field of view.\nThese sources are still detected at a high confidence level on the\nMOS detectors, which are less affected by CCD gaps. To improve\nthe statistical significance of our results in the analysis that follows,\nwe use the MOS data only. We note, however, that using the PN\ndetector does not modify our conclusions. The vignetting and PSF\ncorrections were applied by creating individual auxiliary files for\neach source. The auxiliary files were then combined using the AD-\nDARF task in FTOOLS. The data have been binned to give at least\n20 counts per bin so that Gaussian statistics apply. We fit a single\npower-law model to the data. The spectral fit results are presented\nin Table 4.\nThe coadded spectrum of all 61 sources is best fitted by a power-\nlaw spectral energy distribution \u0005 = 1.83+0.04\u22120.05, much steeper than the\nspectrum of the XRB at these energies. This spectrum is dominated\nby several bright sources. Excluding the nine sources that contribute\nabout 60 per cent of the counts in the 0.5\u20138 keV band, we find \u0005 =\n1.49 \u00b1 0.06. Note, however, that the exclusion of the sources with\na large number of photons may introduce a bias against the sources\nwith a soft spectrum. This is because of the large effective area of the\nEPIC CCD detectors at soft energies, implying that a large number\nTable 4.

Although there are a few BL AGN with\nsignificant photoelectric absorption, as demonstrated above, their\ncontribution to the coadded BL AGN spectrum is minimal. When we\nadd the above 24 sources to the six (spectroscopically unidentified)\nsources that appear point-like on optical images and present blue\ncolours, and hence are candidate QSOs, we obtain \u0005 = 1.98+0.04\u22120.06.\nThe seven NL\/AL AGN have a flatter spectrum, \u0005 = 1.64 \u00b1 0.11.\nWhen we include the 11 nearby AGN (extended in the optical with\nred colours), we obtain a spectrum of \u0005 = 1.50+0.08\u22120.08, similar to\nthe spectrum of the X-ray background at these energies. Finally,\nthe eight \u2018optically faint\u2019 sources, i.e. those which have no optical\ncounterparts in the SDSS, have a very flat spectrum (albeit with\nlarge uncertainties), \u0005 \u2248 1.1 \u00b1 0.3, suggesting large amounts of\nobscuration.\n6 D I S C U S S I O N\nThe XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey provides the opportunity to explore\nin detail the sources that are responsible for a large fraction of the\nXRB (about 50 per cent at the flux limit of our survey, f 2\u20138 keV \u2248\n10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121).\nThe hardness ratio distribution provides some initial information\non their X-ray spectral properties. The population synthesis models\n(e.g. Comastri et al. 2001) predict that about two-thirds of the 2\u2013\n10 keV X-ray-selected sources with a flux higher than f 2\u201310 keV >\n10\u221214 erg s\u22121cm\u22122 should present a rest-frame column >1022 cm\u22122\n(roughly one-third should have N H > 1023 cm\u22122). From Fig. 6 (up-\nper panel), where the distribution of the rest-frame column densities\nis plotted for the spectroscopically identified sources, it appears that\na very small fraction of the sources have columns N H > 1022 cm\u22122.\nA deficit of strongly absorbed sources has also been noticed in the\nbright XMM\u2013Newton samples of Piconcelli et al. (2002) and Cac-\ncianiga et al. (2004). In Fig. 6 (lower panel) we plot the rest-frame\ncolumn density distribution for all sources (including those with\nphotometric redshift). We see that only about 20 and 3 per cent of\nour sources have a column density higher than 1022 and 1023 cm\u22122,\nrespectively, in disagreement with the standard population synthesis\nmodels.\nWe further explore the spectral properties of the hard X-ray sam-\nple as a function of X-ray flux. Even at the relatively faint flux levels\nprobed here, the average spectrum of all sources (\u0005 \u2248 1.8) is much\nsteeper than the spectrum of the XRB in the 2\u201310 keV band \u0005 \u2248 1.4\u2013\n1.5 (e.g. Gendreau et al. 1995; Miyaji et al. 1998). This may be due\nto a few bright sources that dominate the total counts, thus contam-\ninating the average spectrum. Excluding the nine brighter sources,\nwhich contribute about 60 per cent of the total source counts, we\nobtain a flatter spectral index with \u0005 \u2248 1.6. The hardening of the\nspectral index above, with the exclusion of the nine bright sources,\ncould represent a trend where harder (more absorbed) sources are\ndetected with decreasing flux. However, when we divide our sample\ninto two 2\u20138 keV flux bins, we find no evidence for spectral harden-\ning. We obtain \u0005 = 1.75 \u00b1 0.06 (49 objects) and \u0005 = 1.81 \u00b1 0.06\n(12 objects) for the sources with flux 10\u221214 < f 2\u20138 keV < 10\u221213 and\nf 2\u20138 keV > 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 respectively. The above conclusion is\nfurther supported by inspection of Fig. 5, where the hardness ratios\nare plotted as a function of the 2\u20138 keV flux. Apart from the three\nbrightest sources, which present steep spectra, there is no obvious\nevidence for the hardening of the hardness ratio with decreasing\nflux. This is naturally explained as the absorbing columns are not\nlarge enough to affect the 2\u20138 keV band significantly [but they can\naffect the soft 0.5\u20132 keV and thus the total 0.5\u20138 keV band (see e.g.\nTozzi et al. 2001; Alexander et al. 2003)]. Thus, there is no marked\nevolution of the hardness ratio in the 2\u20138 keV band, at least in the\nlimited flux range probed by our survey. However, we note that at\nleast two deeper X-ray surveys appear to find evidence for a weak\nevolution of the hardness ratio with the hard band flux (Harrison\net al. 2003; Fiore et al. 2003; but cf. Tozzi et al. 2001), suggest-\ning that a number of sources with higher column densities may be\ndetected at fluxes fainter than the limit of our survey.\nAs we have identifications for a large fraction of our sources, we\ncan explore the spectral properties of individual classes of sources.\nOut of the 61 detected sources, 31 have been spectroscopically iden-\ntified with AGN. Among the subsample of hard X-ray sources with\nredshifts we find (i) 24 BL AGN, and (ii) seven AGN exhibiting\nnarrow emission or absorption lines. The majority of these sources\nare BL AGN. As many of our identifications come from the 2QZ\nand the SDSS surveys, which are primarily tuned towards the de-\ntection of UV-excess QSOs, the large number of BL AGN found so\nfar among the spectroscopically identified sources is not surprising.\nFor a large number of our sources we do not have spectra. However,\nwe can obtain some information on their nature from their optical\ncolours plotted in Fig. 4. The 25 unidentified sources comprise a\nmixture of (i) six point-like sources in the optical, most of which\nare likely to be QSOs, (ii) 11 optically extended sources with pri-\nmarily red colours suggesting low-z galaxies associated with nearby\neither obscured or low-luminosity AGN, and (iii) eight sources with\nno optical counterpart.\nWe attempt to constrain the coadded spectral properties of the\nabove populations to explore whether they are consistent with those\nof the XRB. For the 24 BL AGNs the average spectrum is steep\nhaving a power-law photon index \u0005 = 2.02+0.04\u22120.05. The addition of the\nsix probable QSOs for which we have determined photometric red-\nshifts yields again a comparable steep spectrum \u0005 \u2248 1.98. Detailed\nspectral fits of individual sources reveal only two BL AGN with non-\nnegligible rest-frame absorbing column densities (>1022 cm\u22122).\nNote that although there have been many claims for the detection\nof BL AGN at moderate to high redshift with significant absorbing\ncolumns, only a limited number of cases are based on spectral fits\n(e.g. Reeves & Turner 2000; Georgantopoulos et al. 2003b; Brusa\net al. 2003).\nThe average spectrum of the seven NL\/AL AGN is somewhat flat-\nter than that of BL AGN (\u0005 \u223c 1.6). The addition of the 11 galaxies\nwith red colours to the above sample results in an average spectrum\nof \u0005 \u223c 1.5 similar to the spectrum of the XRB in this band. Interest-\ningly, the individual fits to the spectra of the seven spectroscopically\nidentified NL\/AL AGN do not exhibit significant excess X-ray ab-\nsorption above the Galactic. This can be explained if some of these\nare relatively weak AGN where the optical nuclear light is diluted\nby the strong galaxy component (e.g. Georgantopoulos et al. 2003a;\nSevergnini et al. 2003; Maiolino et al. 2003).\nFinally, the eight \u2018optically faint\u2019 sources, namely those which\nhave no optical counterpart at the limit of the SDSS, present a very\nflat spectrum, albeit with large uncertainty (\u0005 \u2248 1.1 \u00b1 0.3). Ob-\nscured QSOs at high redshift may be associated with the last sub-\nclass of sources. Indeed, at high redshift the flux observed in the\noptical band originates in rest-frame UV wavelengths, which are\nmost sensitive to reddening. However, even if all eight sources that\nhave no optical counterpart were associated with obscured QSOs,\nthis number would still be too small to be consistent with the\n3\/1 ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN observed in the Local\nUniverse.\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 352, 91\u2013100\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nX-ray spectral properties of hard X-ray sources 99\n7 C O N C L U S I O N S\nWe have reported on the X-ray spectral properties of the hard X-ray-\nselected sample detected in the XMM\u2013Newton\/2dF survey, which\ncovers about 1.6 deg2. Some 61 sources have been detected in the\n2\u20138 keV band down to a flux limit of f \u2248 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. At\nthis flux, our sources contribute about 50 per cent of the XRB in the\n2\u20138 keV band. Spectral identifications exist for 34 sources (these\nproduce about 30 per cent of the X-ray background) while photo-\nmetric redshifts have been determined for another 17 sources, which\nare most probably AGN. Eight sources have no optical counterpart\nto the photometric limit of the SDSS survey (r \u2248 22.5). The main\nconclusions can be summarized as follows:\n(i) The majority (24) of the spectroscopically identified sources\nare BL AGN. However, this may be attributed to the fact that a frac-\ntion of our spectral classification comes from the cross-correlation\nof our catalogue with the 2QZ and the SDSS surveys, which\nprimarily detect UV-excess QSOs. Seven sources are identified as\nNL (or AL) AGN on the basis of the lack of broad emission lines in\nthe optical spectra. Among the sources with no spectroscopic clas-\nsification, six are point-like with blue colours and are most probably\nQSOs. Another 11 are associated with optically extended sources\nwith primarily red colours, suggesting that these are most likely\nnearby AGN.\n(ii) The average spectrum of all sources is represented by a power\nlaw with a steep photon index of \u0005 \u2248 1.8. When we exclude the nine\nbrightest sources, in terms of the number of counts in the total band,\nwe obtain \u0005 \u2248 1.5. The hardness ratio distribution shows a deficit\nof strongly absorbed sources (N H > 1022 cm\u22122), in disagreement\nwith the standard population synthesis models.\n(iii) The average spectrum of the 24 BL AGN is steep (\u0005 \u2248\n1.9). However, there at least two BL AGN that present large (N H >\n1022 cm\u22122) amounts of absorption, as shown from the detailed spec-\ntral fits. Although these present great interest for the physics of AGN,\nit appears that they do not form a substantial fraction of the QSO\npopulation.\n(iv) The spectrum of the seven NL\/AL AGN is flatter, with \u0005 \u223c\n1.6. When we add to the above the 11 spectroscopically unidentified\nsources that are optically extended and present red colours, and thus\nare also probably associated with nearby NL AGN, we obtain a\nsimilar spectrum \u0005 \u2248 1.5.\n(v) The spectrum of the eight sources that have no optical coun-\nterpart is very flat, suggesting that these may be associated with\nobscured AGN at high redshift.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThis work is jointly funded by the European Union and the Greek\nGovernment in the framework of the programme \u2018Promotion of\nExcellence in Technological Development and Research\u2019, project\n\u2018X-ray Astrophysics with ESA\u2019s Mission XMM\u2019.
