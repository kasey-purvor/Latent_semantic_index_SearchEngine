The core of the book, as the\ntitle implies, is an analysis of inequalities of resources, distinguished as three\nkey types\u2014material, health and caring resources. The authors offer a broad\nview of the components of each type: material assets cover both housing\ncondition and tenure and access to private transport for example. But they\nare constrained by the need to be selective in use of already selective\ndatasets. Thus little is made of 'capacity to care for others' as a health\nresource, and the chapter on class, poor health, illness and disability\nnowhere takes account of cognitive impairment. A focus on physical impair-\nment with no mention of dementia has to be a weakness in any analysis of\nthe situation of older people. However, the authors have filled some gaps by\nresourceful use of data from the United States, notably to acknowledge\nrace as a structural dimension, alongside class and gender, in influencing\nhealth.\nThe theoretical argument of the book is that older women's disadvantages\nin material, health and caring resources are compounded by the interrela-\ntionship of resources to each other. It is the role in production and reproduc-\ntion which influences resources in later life. The premise is that limits on\nresources act as 'constraints' on opportunities for independence, autonomy\nand personal well-being. It is assumed that the primary concerns of older\npeople are maintaining independence and autonomy. This is intuitively right,\nbut less well supported by research evidence than other prime assumptions of\nthe book. Arber and Ginn rightly recognise the lack of research exploring\nwith older people their preferences in living and care arrangements, and the\nlimited understanding of how independence and scope for autonomy is\naffected by relationships with caregivers and different living relationships.\nTheir case that 'independence' is constrained by limited access to, or choice\nof, caring resources is necessarily more tentative.\nIn all, the analyses of inequalities between men and women, and between\nclasses, in later life provide a trenchant critique of structural disadvantage\nthroughout the life course. The data will be an effective tool in the campaign\nfor greater equity for older people. Indeed, the book concludes with a clear\npolicy agenda, notably for non-discriminatory pensions policy and for meet-\ning the costs of disability and of caring. But, the authors argue, only funda-\nmental changes in the structure of society and in gender roles can affect the\norigins of disadvantage.\nPATRICIA THORNTON\nUniversity of York\nDeborah Mitchell, Income Transfers in Ten Welfare States, Avebury,\nAldershot, 1991. 241 pp. \u00a330.00.\nThis book presents the results of an analysis of data from the Luxembourg\nIncome Study (LIS) for 10 OECD countries in the early 1980s. Seven of the\ncountries are in Europe (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,\nSwitzerland and the UK), with Australia, Canada, and the USA from outside it.\nMitchell uses these data to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of these 10\n'welfare states'\u2014or, at least, their social security and direct tax systems\u2014in\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n296 Reviews\nreducing poverty and inequality. She provides a comprehensive account, with\nmany tables and diagrams, of their success in these respects.\nThis book is to be welcomed on several grounds. First, it is a clear demon-\nstration of the potential of the kind of microdata supplied by LIS for making\ninternational comparisons which go beyond generalities. Second, her\napproach stresses the needs to look at welfare 'outcomes' rather than simply\nat inputs such as aggregate spending on social security. Indeed, she finds\nthat 'using per capita expenditures to predict outcomes would be highly mis-\nleading' (p. 164), with little correlation between social security as a percent-\nage of GDP and outcome measures like post-transfer poverty gaps. Third, her\nexposition of the concepts used will make the book useful to students of dis-\ntribution and inequality, with the studies of the various measures used fol-\nlowed by examples of their application. Fourth, and perhaps most impor-\ntantly, she brings together the effects of both social security and taxation,\ndemonstrating how limited an analysis of transfer systems would be without\nthe latter. Bringing into her analysis the idea of 'clawback' of social security\nbenefits through the offsetting effects of taxation:\nraises doubts about the commonly held view that income-tested social\nsecurity systems are necessarily more efficient in targetting the poor rather\nthan the non-poor...This evidence lends some credence to the claim that\ntaxation can act as a de facto income test (p. 103).\nA first reservation is simply the result of impatience: the data used mainly\nrefer to the early 1980s. At that point, for instance, the UK comes out very\nwell by comparison with almost all the other countries surveyed in terms of\nits post-transfer poverty gap (except where the 'poverty line is taken at the\nhighest value of 50 per cent of median income', when Sweden does better).\nGiven the trends in inequality, in Britain (and elsewhere) over the 1980s, it\nis to be hoped that Mitchell will soon be able to repeat her analysis with data\nfor the late 1980s.\nSecond, while there is a short chapter on some of the problems with com-\nparability of the LIS data for different countries, the general tone of the book\nis, perhaps over-confident that like really is being compared with like.\nAnalysis using LIS is clearly a greater leap forward for multi-country com-\nparisons of this kind. However, numerous differences between the original\ndatasets for each country remain, which must temper confidence in some of\nthe conclusions reached.\nFinally, and perhaps most seriously, the discussion throughout focuses\nonly on poverty and inequality reduction as outcomes of social security. This\nleaves the impression that other aims are unimportant\u2014such as redistribu-\ntion within individuals' own lifetimes, or protection of accustomed living\nstandards, and other areas where the welfare state may step in to fill areas of\npossible market failure.\nFor this reader, a discussion of these wider aims of social security\u2014and of\nways of measuring their importance in different countries\u2014would have been a\nmore interesting conclusion to the volume than the discussion of the various\n'typologies' of welfare states which in fact concludes it. Mitchell's approach\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 22 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nReviews 297\ndemonstrates how many dimensions there are to the ways in which different\nsystems affect poverty and inequality. It seems a pity then to reduce the com-\nparison back to putting the systems into three or four generalised boxes.\nJOHN HILLS\nLondon School of Economics\nAletha C. Huston (ed.), Children in Poverty: Child Development and Public\nPolicy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1991. x + 331 pp.\n\u00a330.00.\nChildren in Poverty attempts to fill an important gap in public policy analyses\nof poverty\u2014a child centred approach to policy formulation and implementa-\ntion. Focusing on the situation in the United States, it sets itself the task of\nanswering three questions: Why are so many children growing up in poor\nfamilies? What are the effects of poverty on children's physical, cognitive,\nsocial and emotional development? And how can public policy and policy\nresearch contribute to preventing or alleviating the effects of poverty on chil-\ndren?\nThe book aims to meet its objectives through an edited collection of 12\nchapters which cover the impact of poverty on parenting, single parent fami-\nlies, income maintenance, education and health. Its coverage of these issues\nis clear, well-presented and interesting, although the pictures it presents are\ndispiriting. The wealthiest nation on earth has systematically failed a large\nproportion of its children by locking itself into a nostalgic view of 'the family\nas the provider of all things to its members' and neglecting to provide public\npolicies aimed at meeting children's (or anyone else's) specific needs.\nThe book effectively tracks not only the disadvantages children have expe-\nrienced over time, but the exacerbation of child poverty during the Reagan\nyears as a direct result of public policy aimed at decreasing public expendi-\nture on welfare. Consequently, children living in single parent families\nheaded by white and black women bear the brunt of such approaches to\nwelfare. The book also indicates the importance of the ideology gap between\nthe stay-at-home mother caring for her children of the American Dream and\nthe reality of public policies forcing mother out into the labour market to\nundertake low-paid work whether or not she has dependent children. Such\nwork would not lift her and her children out of the poverty trap and neither\nwould she have adequate public assistance on the child care front. But, she\nwould be expected to meet whatever shortfalls arose from within her own\nresources. This analysis, particularly as it is elaborated in Chapter 3, can be\neasily used by the Right to pathologise single-parent families and reinforce\ntheir views that the individual family, preferably in the form of a two parent\nwhite heterosexual one, is responsible for ensuring the economic and emo-\ntional well-being of its members.\nThat the impact of both persistent and temporary poverty on children limits\nthe realisation of their potential emotionally, socially and economically and\nlocks them into various forms of anti-social behaviour including crime and\ndrugs is a major theme of this book. The bleakness of this analysis is tempered\nby the acknowledgement that not all poor children end up in such depressing\nsituations. Some do manage to lead worthwhile lives and claim their place in\n"}
