Theoretically, pre-\ndictions have been made that there should be an island of\nstability of superheavy nuclei around N \u0002 184 and Z \u0002\n114, 120, or 126, depending on the model employed [3\u20137].\nInformation concerning the excited-state structure of\nsuperheavy nuclei is scarce, so the testing of structure\ncalculations has been limited. A promising area of\nprogress is represented by the observation of rotational\n\u0004-ray transitions in 252;254102 No [8,9] and 252;254100 Fm [10],\nshowing the deformed character of these nuclei, which\ncan be described theoretically [11]. The \u0004-ray transitions\nfrom noncollective one-quasiparticle states form another\nimportant probe into the structure of superheavy nuclei\n[12]. By measuring the properties and decays of quasi-\nparticle states, essential information about the nucleonic\norbits close to the Fermi surfaces can be gained. Indeed,\ndetailed knowledge of single-particle states is required\nfor the development of reliable nuclear structure models.\nIn the present work, we consider multiquasiparticle\n(multi-QP) states formed by breaking pairs of nucleons.\nUnpaired nucleons couple their angular momenta to\nstates with total spin projection K onto the symmetry\naxis in deformed, axially symmetric nuclei. The K values\ncan be large, and, due to the high degree of their K\nforbiddenness, \u0004-ray transitions from high-K into low-K\nstates are strongly hindered, leading to the formation of\nlong-lived high-K isomers. In addition, there are influen-0031-9007=04=92(25)=252501(4)$22.50 \uf6d9important in increasing the survival probability of super-\nheavy nuclei. Indeed, high-K isomers might become cru-\ncial in the exploration of even heavier nuclei. In the\npresent work, we focus on high-spin isomerism and the\nangular-momentum effect on the stability of even-even\nsuperheavy nuclei.\nConfiguration-constrained potential-energy-surface\n(PES) calculations [13] have been performed to deter-\nmine the deformations and excitation energies of multi-\nQP states. Single-particle levels are obtained from the\nnonaxial deformed Woods-Saxon potential with the set of\nuniversal parameters [14]. In order to reduce the unphysi-\ncal fluctuation of the weakened pairing field (due to the\nblocking effect of unpaired nucleons) an approximate\nparticle-number projection has been used by means of\nthe Lipkin-Nogami method [15], with pairing strengths\ndetermined by the average gap method [16]. In the\nconfiguration-constrained PES calculation, it is required\nto adiabatically block the unpaired nucleon orbits that\nspecify a given configuration. This has been achieved by\ncalculating and identifying the average Nilsson quantum\nnumbers for every orbit involved in a configuration [13].\nThe total energy of a state consists of a macroscopic part\nthat is obtained with the standard liquid-drop model [17]\nand a microscopic part that is calculated by the\nStrutinsky shell-correction approach, including blocking\neffects. The PES is calculated in the space of quadru-\npole (\u00062, \u0004) and hexadecapole (\u00064) deformations. The\nconfiguration-constrained PES calculation can properly\ntreat the shape polarization due to unpaired nucleons.\nFollowing predictions from theory, many experiments\n[8\u201310] have demonstrated the systematic existence of\ndeformed superheavy nuclei. In fact, almost all the super-\nheavy nuclei found experimentally are believed to be2004 The American Physical Society 252501-1\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending25 JUNE 2004VOLUME 92, NUMBER 25enhanced due to deformed shell effects. Furthermore,\ndeformed high-K orbits close to the Fermi surfaces can\nform various high-K multi-QP states at low excitation\nenergies. In the present work, we are interested in possible\nisomeric states. The combination of high K, low energy,\nand axially deformed shape provides the necessary con-\nditions for the formation of isomers. Additionally, a par-\nity opposite to that of the ground state (g.s.) can further\nreduce the transition rate from an excited-state to the g.s.\nor to a member of the g.s. band (g.s.b.). Figures 1 and 2\ndisplay our calculations of low-energy high-K two-QP\nstates with negative parity for even-even Z \u0001 100 nuclei.\nThese investigated states have deformed, axially sym-\nmetric equilibrium shapes.\nIn a recent experiment [18], \u0001 decays from iso-\nmeric states in 270110Ds were observed with a half-life of\n6:0\u00038:2\u00042:2 ms that is significantly longer than the 100\u0003140\u000440 \ts\nof the corresponding g.s. Possible configurations for these\nisomers were proposed to be K\n \u0002 9\u0004\u0005\u000b 112 \u0004\u0006725\u0007 \b\n7\n2\n\u0003\u0006613\u0007\t and\/or 10\u0004\u0005\u000b 112 \u0004\u0006725\u0007 \b 92\u0003\u0006615\u0007\t [18]. Our\ncalculations confirm these assignments and indeed show\nthat the 9\u0004 and 10\u0004 two-quasineutron states exist sys-\ntematically at low excitation energies (see Fig. 1) with\naxially symmetric deformations around \u00062 \n 0:2. In\n270Ds, the calculated energies of the 9\u0004 and 10\u0004 isomers\nare 1.39 and 1.26 MeV, respectively, agreeing with the\nexperimental estimate of 1.13 MeV [18]. Furthermore,\nconfiguration-constrained PES calculations allow us to\ndetermine the Q\u0001 value of the \u0001 decay from a given\nconfiguration of the parent nucleus to a given state of\nthe daughter.

Calculated excitation energies for two-quasineutron\nstates.\n252501-2the two-quasineutron \u000b9\u0004 and \u000b10\u0004 isomers to the cor-\nresponding isomers of 266Hs have very similar \u0001-particle\nenergies, giving an average value of 11.06 MeV. This\nis in good agreement with the observed energy of\n10.95 MeV [18]. The \u000b9\u0004 and \u000b10\u0004 isomeric \u0001 decays\nto the g.s. of 266Hs also have similar \u0001 energies with an\naverage value of 11.93 MeV, in agreement with the mea-\nsured energy of 12.15 MeV [18]. One also expects that the\nisomer can feed by \u0001 emission into other states with low\nangular momenta.\nAlso from 270Ds, an observed \u0001 emission with E\u0001 \u0002\n11:15 MeV was found in coincidence with a 218 keV\n\u0004-ray signal and was suggested to decay to the 8\u0003 mem-\nber of the rotational g.s.b. of 266Hs [18] (the \u0004-ray energy\nwas found to be close to the calculated energy of the\ntransition from the 8\u0003 to 6\u0003 states of the g.s.b. in\n266Hs). We calculate that the 8\u0003 to 6\u0003 transition has an\nenergy of 234 keV. The calculated \u0001 energies of the \u000b9\u0004\nand \u000b10\u0004 decays to the 8\u0003 state are 11.42 and 11.29 MeV,\nrespectively. In 270Ds, however, we found another low-\nlying 10\u0004 state that has a two-quasiproton configuration\n\n 112\n\u0003\u0006615\u0007 \b 92\u0004\u0006505\u0007 with a calculated excitation energy\nof 1.07 MeV, giving E\u0001\u0005\n10\u0004 ! 8\u0003\t \u0002 11:10 MeV, in\ngood agreement with the observed value of 11.15 MeV.\nIn 266Hs, the \n10\u0004 state has a relatively high excitation\nenergy of 2.54 MeV.\nTo understand the above observations, we note that the\nprobability for \u0001 decay is determined by two factors:\n(i) an exponential dependence on the height of the barrier\nthat the \u0001 particle needs to penetrate and (ii) the prefor-\nmation factor, characterizing the ease with which an \u0001\nparticle is formed at the surface. The latter is proportional\nto the pair density at the Fermi surface [19], implying a\nconsiderable reduction for two-QP states, as is the case\nfor high-K isomers. An \u0001 decay between two different\nisomeric configurations is in principle forbidden. Further-\nmore, if the \u0001 particle carries a certain angular mo-\nmentum, the barrier is increased due to the centrifugal\npotential. The increase of the barrier height and width\nreduces the \u0001-emission probability and hence increases\nthe lifetime. However, due to the exceptionally high en-\nergy of the \u0001 particle for the case of superheavy nuclei,\nthe centrifugal barrier is of less importance, and the150 155 160 165 170\nN\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2.0\n2.4\nE e\nx\n \n(M\neV\n)\nZ=102\nZ=100\nK\u03c0=7\u2212,  \u03c0{7\/2+[633], 7\/2\u2212 [514]}\n150 155 160 165 170\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2\n2.4\nZ=108\nZ=106\nZ=104\nK\u03c0=7\u2212,  \u03c0{9\/2+[624], 5\/2\u2212 [512]}\nFIG. 2.

This is consistent\nwith the observation of the relatively long lifetimes for\nthe \u0001 decays of the isomers in 270Ds and 266Hs [18].\nTherefore, the high-K isomerism can enhance the stabil-\nity of such nuclei against \u0001 emission.\nHigh-K isomers have also been found in 250;256Fm and\n254No. In 250Fm, a 1.8-s isomer [20] was observed at an\nexcitation energy of 1.0 MeV [10]. The 254No nucleus has a\n0.28-s isomer [20] with an energy >0:5 MeV [10], and\nthere is recent evidence for associated collective structure\n[21]. However, experiments have not determined spins\nand parities for these two isomers. A likely configuration\nin 250Fm is \n 72\n\u0003\u0006633\u0007 \b 72\u0004\u0006514\u0007, resulting in a 7\u0004 state.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the calculated excitation energy of the\n7\u0004 configuration is 1.01 MeV, which agrees well with the\nexperimental value of 1.0 MeV [10]. A two-quasineutron\n8\u0004 configuration, \u000b 72\n\u0003\u0006624\u0007 \b 92\u0004\u0006734\u0007, is also possible\nwith a calculated energy of 0.97 MeV in 250Fm. Our\ncalculations show that 8\u0004 states exist systematically in\nthe N \u0002 150 isotones with excitation energies around\n1.0 MeV. In 254No, alternative configurations for the ob-\nserved isomer are \u000b 72\n\u0003\u0006613\u0007 \b 92\u0004\u0006734\u0007 and \n 72\u0004\u0006514\u0007 \b\n9\n2\n\u0003\u0006624\u0007, with Ecalex \u0002 1:12 and 1.48 MeV, respectively.

In Ref. [23], it has been shown\nthat the spontaneous-fission half-life increases consider-\nably due to the effect of the unpaired nucleon in odd-mass\nnuclei. This can be understood in terms of reduced\nsuperfluidity. The configuration-constrained PES calcu-\nlations allow us to determine the fission barrier for a\ngiven configuration. Figure 4 shows the configuration-\nconstrained fission barrier for the 7\u0004 isomer in 256Fm.\n(It needs to be mentioned that an isomer might undergo a\nmore complex dynamical process during fission, without\nkeeping a fixed configuration.) The increase of the fission\nbarrier in both height and width implies an increase in\nthe fission lifetime. In the calculations of fission barriers,\nthe inclusion of the nonaxial \u0004 deformation is important\nbecause the \u0004 degree of freedom can significantly affect\nthe shape of the fission barrier. In 256Fm, for example, the\nnonaxial PES calculations result in the barrier heights\nbeing lowered by 2.4 and 2.6 MeV for the g.s. and 7\u0004\nisomer, respectively, compared with axial calculations.\nFigure 5 displays the calculated PES of the g.s. in\n256Fm, with the fission trajectory marked. The 7\u0004 isomer\nhas a similar fission trajectory.\nAlthough the production of high-spin states in super-\nheavy nuclei is generally inhibited by their increased\nfission probability, this does not apply when the angular-\nmomentum is noncollective and aligned with the sym-\nmetry axis, as for high-K states.

Two-QP excitations can also appear in odd-\nmass and odd-odd superheavy nuclei, resulting in three-\nand four-QP states, respectively. These have not yet been\nconsidered in detail. Furthermore, the present investiga-\ntion is limited to deformed superheavy nuclei. However,\nthe angular-momentum effects should also apply to\nspherical superheavy nuclei.\nIn summary, we have investigated multi-QP states\nin even-even superheavy nuclei using configuration-\nconstrained PES calculations. Low-energy high-K de-\nformed configurations are predicted to be present in the\nvicinity of the Fermi surface, resulting in the formation of\nhigh-spin isomeric states. The high-spin isomerism in-\ncreases the barrier to fission and decreases the probability\nof \u0001-particle emission. For a given class of superheavy\nnuclei with sufficiently short lifetimes, we have discussed\nan inversion of stability, in that the excited states can be\nlonger lived than the corresponding ground states. These\neffects result in increased survival probabilities of super-\nheavy nuclei. Therefore, it can be stated that via the\npopulation of high-K states in experiments, one may be\nable to extend the nuclear chart further into the island of\nsuperheavy nuclei. The energy calculations of multi-QP\nstates and their \u0001 decays indicate that the single-particle\norbits of the deformed Woods-Saxon potential apply also\nto the superheavy mass region. Further studies of high-K\nstates will provide essential tests, not only of our specific\nisomer predictions, but also of mean-field models in\ngeneral.252501-4This work was supported by the Chinese Major\nState Basic Research Development Program\nNo. G2000077400, the Chinese National Natural\nScience Foundations (Grants No. 10175002 and\nNo. 10047001), the Doctoral Foundation of Chinese\nMinistry of Education (20030001088), the Knowledge\nInnovation Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences\n(KJCX2-SW-N02), the Swedish Science Research\nCouncil(VR), the U.K. Royal Society, and the U.K.\nScience and Engineering Research Council.[1] S.
