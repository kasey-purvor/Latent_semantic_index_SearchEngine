The paper focuses on CORONA \nimagery. With the advent of computers and subsequently the increase of processing power, the sciences of \nphotogrammetry and remote sensing and their respective approaches have evolved into a more \ninterdisciplinary network within which GIS (Geographical Information Science) was a catalyst. The sensor \ntechnologies similarly evolved, and the paper discusses potential and trade-offs of this evolution. \nApplications showed that it is up to the user to select the most appropriate approach and media so as to \nmeet the application's needs. \n \n1. Introduction \nOn 3rd of September 2004, USGS decided to stop providing photographic products to the public1. Instead, \ndigital products will be produced and provided. Once the film is digitised, most of it will continue to be \nstored in the USGS facilities. Film with vinegar syndrome will be sent to NARA (National Archives \nRecord Administration) to be placed in frozen storage. \nThe decision of USGS to cease operations in the creation of photographic products raised once again the \nissue of whether the modern photogrammetric scanners can capture the full film quality or not, and \nwhether it is better to extract information from film or from digital product. \nThis paper is comparing the two products with main focus on declassified imagery, in particular the film \nproduct of KH-4B (KH for KeyHole) satellite design of the CORONA program. However, the discussion \ncan be accommodated in other photographic products and applications too. \nLEACHTENAUER et al. (1997) did the first research on the problem of how to best use the CORONA \nproduct. After experiments with KH-4A film product, they concluded that for lossless digitizing, a 4 \u03bcm \ndigitizing spot size is required. However, as GALIATSATOS (2004) proved, the CORONA program had a \nvariety of films, lens, filters, and cameras. This variety resulted in different image quality even between \ncameras of the same mission. LEACHTENAUER et al. (1997) did not discuss on other ways of using the film, \non the film properties (e.g. density, sensitivity), or the film quality itself. This paper aims to continue the \nwork of LEACHTENAUER et al. (1997) through developing on the not-fully developed issues. \nThe discussion will be application-oriented with main focus on current trends and existing work. \nIn the following sections, first a brief historical summary of the CORONA imagery is presented. The main \ncharacteristics of the film and the filters are then illustrated as they were found in the declassified \ndocumentation. A brief history follows regarding the transfer from photointerpretation to image analysis \nand the eventual complementary role of the methods regardless of the media (film or digital). The transfer \nfrom film to CCD sensors is then discussed and the trade-offs are briefly presented. Finally, the focus goes \nback to CORONA and particular applications with all the issues that were met. \n \n2. CORONA imagery \nCORONA was a program designed to support U.S. Intelligence between 1958 and 1972. It officially \nstarted with a formal endorsement by President Dwight E. Eisenhower on 8th February 1958. (HALL, \n1997). The launch operations began on 25th June 1959. On 10th August 1960, the diagnostic mission was \n                                                          \n1 http:\/\/edc.usgs.gov\/USGStostopPhotographicProduction.html (last accessed: December 2008) \n  \nsuccessful, and 2 days later, on 12th August, the capsule for the film was \u201crecovered undamaged\u201d. After \neight failures in photoreconnaissance, the first successful mission occurred on 18th August 1960 when the \nfirst CORONA image of an intelligence target was acquired during Mission 9009 (MCDONALD, 1995). \nThe camera carried on that Mission would be retrospectively designated the KH-1. The next successful \nCORONA Mission would be conducted on 7th December 1960. This time a more advanced camera \nsystem, the KH-2, was on board. From that time, through to the end of the CORONA program in 1972, \nthere was a succession of new camera systems \u2013 the KH-3, KH-4, KH-4A and KH-4B (RICHELSON, 1999). \nIn the end, CORONA acquired over 800,000 frames of photographs with a total coverage of at least 600 to \n750 million nmi2 (square nautical miles) of the Earth\u2019s surface. On 22nd February 1995, President Clinton \nsigned the Executive Order 12951 that declassified those images (CLINTON, 1995a). Furthermore, the \nPresident delegated any future declassification approval to the Director of Defence and State. However, \nthe Executive Order 12951 addresses only the imagery declassification. Other declassification (e.g. \nCORONA reports) falls under Executive Order 12958 (17th April 1995) (CLINTON, 1995b). The latter was \namended by executive order 13292 (25th March 2003) (BUSH, 2003). \nTable 1 summarises the major developments in the CORONA satellite programme. The main differences \nlay in the improvement of the lens, the creation of tougher and finer film, the boost capacity of the rocket, \nthe better control of vehicle stability, and last but not least, the freedom to innovate and to redesign the \nsatellite from scratch. It must be noted that improvements were incorporated into every mission. \n \nTab. 1 - Major operational and construction difference among CORONA designs \n KH-1 KH-2 KH-3 KH-4 KH-4A KH-4B \nPeriod of operation 27\/6\/59-13\/9\/60 26\/10\/60-23\/10\/61 30\/8\/61-13\/1\/62 27\/2\/62-24\/3\/64 24\/8\/63-22\/9\/69 15\/9\/67-25\/5\/72 \nAmount of frames 1432 7246 9918 101743 517688 188526 \nMission life (days) 1 2-3 1-4 6-7 4-15 19 \nAltitude (km)       \nLower (estimated) 192 252 217 211 180 150 \nHigher (estimated) 817 704 232 415 n\/a n\/a \nSuccessful missions 1 3 5 20 49 16 \nTargets USSR Emphasis on USSR Worldwide\/emphasis on denied areas \nAperture width 5.265\uf0b0 5.265\uf0b0 5.265\uf0b0 5.265\uf0b0 5.265\uf0b0 5.265\uf0b0 \nPan angle 71.16\uf0b0 71.16\uf0b0 71.16\uf0b0 71.16\uf0b0 71.16\uf0b0 71.16\uf0b0 \nLens F\/5.0 Tessar F\/5.0 Tessar F\/3.5 Petzval F\/3.5 Petzval F\/3.5 Petzval F\/3.5 Petzval \nFocal length (cm) 61 61 61 61 61 61 \nResolution       \nGround (m) 12.20 7.60 3.70-7.60 3.00-7.60 2.70-7.60 1.80-7.60 \nFilm (lp\/mm) 50-100 50-100 50-100 50-100 120 160 \nNominal ground \ncoverage per image \nframe \n15.3x209 to \n42x579 (km) \n15.3x209 to \n42x579 (km) \n15.3x209 to \n42x579 (km) \n15.3x209 to \n42x579 (km) \n17x232 (km) 13.8x188 (km) \nNominal photoscale \nin film \n1:275,000 to \n1:760,000 \n1:275,000 to \n1:760,000 \n1:275,000 to \n1:760,000 \n1:300,000 1:305,000 1:247,500 \n  \nAll the values in table 1 are nominal. For precise values in every mission, the reader should consult the \noriginal NRO and NARA reports (GALIATSATOS, 2004). Table 1 was made based on information from \nMCDONALD (1997), MADDEN (1996), DAY et al. (1998), and PEEBLES (1997). \nSome of the nominal values of the table 1 are very general and only roughly represent the real values. In \nthis paper we shall focus on the parameters that are relevant to the image quality. \nVarious factors affect the resolution of the panoramic cameras: the resolution capacity of the optics \n(Petzval lens), the resolution capacity of the film, the focus condition of the lens, the exposure and \ndevelopment of the film, and the blur which results from the motion of the aerial image across the film \nduring exposure (NRO, 1967). There are many ways to determine what resolution is.  \nThe Itek engineers were aware of the effect that the angle of the camera with the target and the sun may \nhave to the image quality. For this reason, they were using different camera systems (film, filter) \ndepending on the viewing angle of the camera and the direction of the platform. In more advanced \nsystems, the filter was changing depending on the orbit (ascending \/ descending), the latitude of the target \nand the solar altitude. During the CORONA program, constantly all involved companies (e.g. Itek, Kodak) \nwere experimenting with every mission. \nThe main purpose during operations in the 1960s was to increase the performance of the \nphotointerpretation. As we read in NRO (1967), the focus was on improving the microcontrast, that is the \ncontrast when in high magnification. Thus, the photointerpreter was able to identify small details in the \nimage.  \n \n3. Film photographic properties \nCharacteristic curve \n \nFig. 1 - Sensitometric curves for two different processing methods (NRO, 1970). \n \nAccording to NRO (1970), during the earliest missions, the CORONA project used variable spray \nprocessing conditions for 3404 film. This included a three-level processing \u2013 primary, intermediate and \nfull (which provided different sensitometric responses). Beginning with mission 1104 (7 August 1968), a \nsingle level yardleigh viscous process was used (fig.1). On July 1970 Eastman Kodak replaced film 3404 \n  \nwith film 3414. According to NRO (1970), the 3414 emulsion characteristics are similar to 3404 emulsion \nwith the exception of spectral response and film speed. \n \nSpectral sensitivity \nFigure 2 displays the spectral sensitivity of the films 3404 and 3414, along with the films used in index, \nhorizon and stellar cameras. Notice the higher sensitivity of the films 3404 and 3414 in the red part of the \nspectrum and compare it with the filters that were used in the CORONA program. \n \n \nFig. 2 - Spectral sensitivity curves of the CORONA films (left) and characteristic curves of \nCORONA filters (right) (NRO, 1970). \n \nDynamic Range \nThe definition of the dynamic range of the film is important for deciding the radiometric resolution of the \nscanning. Figure 3 displays the dynamic range of the 3404 film through the assumed acceptable minimum \nand maximum density points. This figure highlights the radiometric resolution of the film (1.5D), which \nempirically corresponds to a 7-bit radiometric resolution (MCGLONE, 2004). \n  \n \nFig. 3 - Assumed acceptable minimum and maximum density points for film 3404 (NRO, 1970). \n \nFilters \nFilters are required for most aerial reconnaissance systems in order to counteract the contrast reduction \neffects from the bluish haze light. The filters commonly employed in CORONA project are Wratten \ngelatine filters and are yellow to red in colour. Generally, the deeper red the filter, the greater the haze \ncutting ability, and the higher the contrast. However, the redder the filter, the higher the filter factor which \nin turn makes longer exposure times necessary. Apart from Wratten filters, there were experiments with \ncolour correction and polarising filters in various missions. Because gelatine filters were drying out in the \nvacuum of space, glass filters were used with the same thickness as gelatine filters. Figure 2 displays the \ndifferent filters that were applied during the CORONA program. \n \n4. Evolution of sciences \nPhotography existed long before satellite observation. L.J.M. Daguerre and J.N. Niepce developed the first \ncommonly used form of photograph between 1835 and 1839. In 1845, the first panoramic photograph was \ntaken, and in 1849 an exhaustive program started to prove that photography could be used for the creation \nof topographic maps. The same year, the first stereo-photography is produced. In 1858, Gaspard Felix \nTournachon took the first known photographs from an overhead platform, a balloon (PHILIPSON, 1997). \nFor the next 101 years, aerial photography was developed and widely used in military and civilian \napplications. The platforms changed to include kites, pigeons, balloons and airplanes (chapter 2 in \nREEVES, 1975). The era of satellite photogrammetry (Slama et al., 1980) starts in 1960 with the CORONA \nmilitary reconnaissance program. The era of using satellite images for mapping and making measurements \nstarts in 1962 with the CORONA KH-4 satellite design. \nCOLWELL (1960) defined photographic interpretation (also termed photointerpretation) as  \n\u201cthe process by which humans examine photographic images for the purpose of \nidentifying objects and judging their significance\u201d \nWith the advent of computer technology, the methods for photographic interpretation changed and the new \nterm image analysis (also termed quantitative analysis) came to complement (underlined) the old term: \n  \n\u201cImage analysis is the process by which humans and\/or machines examine \nphotographic images and\/or digital data for the purpose of identifying objects and \njudging their significance\u201d (PHILIPSON, 1997) \nPhotointerpretation involves direct human interaction, and thus it is good for spatial assessment but not for \nquantitative accuracy. By contrast, image analysis requires little human interaction and it is mainly based \non machine computational capability, and thus it has high quantitative accuracy but low spatial assessment \ncapability. \nToday, both techniques are used in very specific and complementary ways, and the approaches have their \nown roles. On one hand, if digital image processing is applied beforehand to enhance the imagery, then \nthis helps the photointerpreter in his work. On the other hand, image analysis depends on information \nprovided at key stages by an analyst, who is often using photointerpretation (RICHARDS & JIA, 1999). \nKONECNY (2003) defines remote sensing and photogrammetry according to their object of study: \n\u201cPhotogrammetry concerns itself with the geometric measurement of objects in \nanalogue or digital images\u201d \n\u201cRemote sensing can be considered as the identification of objects by indirect \nmeans using naturally existing or artificially created force fields\u201d. \nThus, photogrammetric techniques were adopted by remote sensing mainly for quantitative analysis. In its \nturn, remote sensing expanded the data that could aid an image analyst with the extraction of quantitative \ninformation. \nAll of the above terms give a specific meaning to the approaches, but the approaches complement each \nother when it comes into implementation. In other words, the sciences of photogrammetry and remote \nsensing moved from the previous independent way of working, towards a more interdisciplinary network, \nwhere in comparison with other sciences like GIS, Geodesy, and Cartography, they produce better results \nand increase the processing capability for modern day applications (fig. 4). \n \n \nFig. 4 - Classical and modern geospatial information system (reproduced from KONECNY, 2003) \n \n  \n5. Evolution of technology \nThe interdisciplinary approach has been encouraged by developments in computer technology, especially \nGeographical Information Systems. In the past, the main product was film or photographic print recorded \nat visible wavelengths (some special colour films were sensitive in IR light too). The distance of cameras \nfrom the Earth\u2019s surface and the need for high ground resolution (especially for military reconnaissance \nprograms) demanded a sufficiently high resolution film. This led to the production of films with 160 \nlp\/mm resolution (CORONA program), 320 lp\/mm (GAMBIT program), and higher. Even with today\u2019s \ntechnology, such resolutions cannot be transferred to digital format for computer processing without loss \nof data and interpretability. During that era, the best approach was photointerpretation alone, since the \ncomputers were not powerful enough to read and analyse such huge amount of data. Thus, with the use of \nlarge light-tables and magnifiers, the film was analysed by the most advanced computer in existence, the \nhuman brain. \nIn 1970, W. Boyle and G. Smith of Bell Labs discovered the CCD (Charged Coupled Device) (BOYLE & \nSMITH, 1970). CCD is an imaging electro-optical sensor. It can record radiation from a ground resolution \nelement for representation within a pixel in an image. The simplest CCD array is linear (REES, 1999). \nLater, the CCD was improved and it became the dominant process for image capture. Although other \ndevices became available (e.g. CMOS, Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor), the CCD gives the \nbest performance in terms of resolution, sensitivity, and other parameters, with the exception of cost. \nFELBER (2002) provides a very good summary of the development, structure and operation of CCDs. \nThe product of CCD image capture is a matrix of digital picture elements (pixels). It can be attached to \ndetectors that are sensible to a wide range of wavelengths. It is sensitive to the visible, near-infrared, near-\nultraviolet, thermal and microwave parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. On the contrary, film is limited \nto available film emulsions and spectral characteristics.  \nWhen comparing film with the CCD in photogrammetry and remote sensing applications, the former has \nthe advantages of finer resolution, rigorous geometry and being a mature technology (established \nreliability of performance, with support and systems existing worldwide). But the processing of the film \nitself introduces distortions that are nearly impossible to model (treatment during film development, film \nmust be scanned). \nThe product of CCD image capture may be derived from CCD matrices or CCD linear arrays. Depending \non the product, the user has to apply different techniques for the optimum gain of qualitative and\/or \nquantitative information. Always, the user must know as much as possible about the product\u2019s \nbackground. Further processing mainly depends on the aims and objectives and the tools used to aid the \nprocess. \nThe CCD matrices share the same conical geometry with film cameras. The resolution is coarser, but there \nis rigorous geometry with better precision and fewer distortions when compared to film (KASSER, 2002a). \nOn the other hand, the CCD linear arrays have cylindro-conical geometry. This type of geometry is found \non most of today\u2019s satellite sensors (Landsat, IKONOS, SPOT, etc.), even though not all of them use \nCCDs (Landsat) (KASSER, 2002b). This geometry implies new digital data process approaches, which \nforbid the use of standard software of classic photogrammetric stations (KASSER, 2002a). \nTORLEGARD (1992) wrote that the aerial film camera would be the main sensing system for map \nproduction and revision in large- and medium-scale cartography for the next several years. LIGHT (1996) \npresents a list of tradeoffs between CCD and film sensors, and Fricker et al. (1999) identify practical \ndifficulties for the transition from film to digital. Today, one would agree that the high resolution space \nsystems and the CCD sensors have improved significantly and are already replacing film cameras in most \napplications. \nThe airborne imagery cannot be replaced mainly because of limitations in the use of spaceborne sensors \n(Fricker, 2005). For this reason, in the recent years there has been development of airborne digital sensors \nsuch as Leica ADS80 (Airborne Digital Sensor), Microsoft UltraCamX\u2122, and Integraph Z\/I Imaging\u00ae \nDMC\u00ae (Digital Mapping Camera) systems. Recent improvements in the automation and quality of the \nsensors (Jacobsen, 2007) have resulted in an increase of commercially available digital systems. \n  \n \n6. Focus on applications \nTAPPAN et al. (2000) preferred to photointerpret CORONA straight from the film without any digitizing. \nThis is a rigorous approach but it inhibits the GIS potential of data integration. BINDSCHADLER & \nVORNBERGER (1998) scanned the film to a satisfactory scale for their application, while PALMER (2002) \npreferred to create large scale photographic prints and then process these on a flatbed scanner. Palmer\u2019s \napproach is simple but effective and demonstrates that for certain applications complex data pre-\nprocessing may not be necessary. \nFrom the above, it is necessary to mention that the way CORONA will be prepared depends heavily on the \nneeds of the application and the expertise of the people using it. This means that no matter how well the \nCORONA film is scanned at the USGS facilities, the final digital product can be a major burden for \npeople who do not have the relevant expertise or computing power to handle it. \nAs GALIATSATOS (2004) concludes, the use of photogrammetric scanner for the scanning of the CORONA \nfilm is probably the best solution for the creation of digital product. The main reasons are the capability to \nscan at high resolution without interpolation, and the resulting digital files are geometrically corrected. \nThe latter is achieved by the use of specific algorithms that reproduce the correction model of the \nscanner\u2019s errors. USGS is using photogrammetric scanner (Leica DSW700), and the film is scanned to the \nhighest optical resolution of the scanner (7 \u03bcm), where the scanner utilises a Schneider 120mm, f\/5.6, \ncolour-corrected lens. The radiometric uniformity is calibrated monthly and the geometric accuracy is \ncalibrated periodically through the year (there is an effort to do it monthly) and is less than 2 micron \n(Borchardt, 2005; 2009, personal communication). \nAs LEACHTENAUER et al. (1997) showed the 4 \u03bcm would be the ideal scanning resolution so as to scan the \nfilm without any loss of information. This is a good reason for people to insist on using the film. On the \nother hand, is it really important this difference in resolution for the majority of applications? \nTHOM (2002) shows that the smaller the step of scan, the better will be the precision and the spatial \nresolution, but there may also be loss of radiometric precision. In practical applications, the impact of \nradiometric quality on the geometric precision is not easy to evaluate. Generally, weakly contrasted details \ncan be separated when attention has been given to the radiometric quality. The USGS digital product of \nCORONA imagery shows that the majority of the radiometric values represented on the film are captured. \nFrom the film density range we gather that the film is roughly 7-bit and empirically we need to scan two \nbits more so as to capture the full range. The USGS digital product is 8-bit, still more than the assumed \ndensity range of the film, however not as much as experience dictates. In most applications though, this is \na negligible difference. \nGALIATSATOS et al. (2008) identified a distortion in the texture of the imagery after they discovered the \nresult of it in the extracted DEM. They used Vexcel VX4000 which is a matrix (or area) scanner. KASSER \n(2002c) points out that even if a calibration is applied to the scanner, some irregularities may persist. For \nexample, calibration errors or dust particles will affect the radiometric precision of the scanning. In \nparticular for matrix CCD scanners, there will be periodic and annoying artefacts due to repetition of \nerrors according to a regular paving, and of radiometric discontinuities between successive positions of the \nmatrix. Baltsavias (1999) mentions that there may be radiometric differences along the seam lines of the \npartial scans of the matrix. \nThe DSW700 is a matrix scanner too, and a similar texture distortion of smaller extent was detected \n(STICHELBAUT, 2008, personal communication) by the research team that is working in the Altai region of \nSiberia (GHEYLE et al., 2004). This is an issue that has not been resolved yet. Jacobsen and Gaffga (1998) \ndemonstrate the issue of image quality deterioration during scanning. Other problems that were identified \nin the USGS digital product were Newton rings and dust particles. \n \n7. Conclusions \nAs the world evolves, things change. Some time ago photogrammetry and remote sensing communities \nworked independently, and the digitising of the film was technically impossible. Nowadays, the sciences \n  \nhave approached and complement each other in an interdisciplinary way. Similarly, the processing power \nof modern personal computers allows the digital analysis of large amounts of data. So, the transfer of \nmedia from the film to the digital is an inevitable result of the world's evolution, similar to the transfer \nfrom the papyrus to the codex, and the from the codex to the book. \nThe digitising is not perfect, even if the professional photogrammetric scanners are used. It may not \ncapture the full information included in the film and some errors may be incorporated in the effort to get as \nmuch information as possible, especially if care is not taken with regard to radiometric precision. \nUltimately, it depends on the application needs, and most applications do not require more than what the \nphotogrammetric scanners can offer. Some applications actually used photographic printing techniques \nand flatbed scanners, and even though these techniques did not capture the full potential of CORONA \nimagery, they still provided useful results. \nIn summary, the USGS digital product is not a perfect representation of the information content of the \nfilm. However, it captures the greatest amount of the information content within the limits of the available \ntechnology. The final image file may be large but modern technology can handle it without much trouble. \nIt is the user who should be aware of the product's background (e.g. scanning artefacts, film \ncharacteristics) and should have the expertise to utilise the full potential of the acquired image information \nin a GIS environment. \nOn the other hand, the film duplication process is not perfect either, as the printer introduced a slight \nstretch in the Y-axis (Happell, 2000, personal communication). The technology to directly process the \nparticular film frame is difficult to find today, as it only existed within the intelligence community. Again, \nit depends on the user's expertise as to how the film will be processed. For this, the film offers more \nfreedom to the user to select an approach for the application. However, if it is not digitised then any \npotential use of GIS is inhibited. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe author appreciates the helpful and detailed comments given by anonymous reviewers. \n \nReferences \nBALTSAVIAS, E.P., 1999: Photogrammetric scanners - survey, technological developments and \nrequirements, ISPRS Commission I Symposium, Bangalore, India, IAPRS, vol.32, part 1. \nBINDSCHADLER, R., & VORNBERGER, P., 1998: Changes in the west Antarctic ice sheet since 1963 from \ndeclassified satellite photography, Science, vol.279, 30th January, pp.689-692. \nBOYLE, W.S., & SMITH, G.E., 1970: Charged coupled semiconductor devices, Bell systems technical \njournal, 42, 587. \nBUSH, G.W., 2003: Further amendment to Executive Order 12958, as amended, Classified national \nsecurity information, 25 March 2003, Washington D.C. \nCLINTON, W.J., 1995a: Release of imagery acquired by space-based national intelligence reconnaissance \nsystems, Executive Order No.12951, 22 February 1995, Washington D.C. \nCLINTON, W.J., 1995b: Classified national security information, Executive Order No. 12958, 17 April \n1995, Washington D.C. \nCOLWELL, R.N.
