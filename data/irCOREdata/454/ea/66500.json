We calculate the evolution of clusters by combining the semi-analytic\nmodel of galaxy formation of Cole et al. with a simple model for the radial profile\nof the intracluster gas. We focus on the cluster X-ray luminosity function and on the\nrelation between X-ray temperature and luminosity (the T-L relation). Observations\nof these properties are known to disagree with predictions based on scaling relations\nwhich neglect gas cooling and heating processes. We show that cooling alone is not\nenough to account for the flatness of the observed T-L relation or for the lack of strong\nredshift evolution in the observed X-ray luminosity function. Gas heating, on the other\nhand, can solve these two problems: in the \u039bCDM cosmology, our model reproduces\nfairly well the T-L relation and the X-ray luminosity function. Furthermore, it predicts\nonly weak evolution in these two properties out to z = 0.5, in agreement with recent\nobservational data. A successful model requires an energy input of 1\u20132 \u00d71049 ergs\nper solar mass of stars formed. This is comparable to the total energy released by\nthe supernovae associated with the formation of the cluster galaxies. Thus, unless the\ntransfer of supernovae energy to the intracluster gas is very (perhaps unrealistically)\nefficient, additional sources of energy, such as mechanical energy from AGN winds are\nrequired. However, the amplification of an initial energy input by the response of the\nintracluster medium to protocluster mergers might ease the energy requirements. Our\nmodel makes definite predictions for the X-ray properties of groups and clusters at\nhigh redshift. Some of these, such as the T-L relation at z \u2243 1, may soon be tested\nwith data from the Chandra and Newton satellites.\nKey words: galaxies: formation\n1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the fundamental puzzles of the X-ray universe con-\ncerns the relation between the X-ray luminosity and gas\ntemperature of clusters of galaxies. A simple scaling analysis\n(Kaiser 1986) suggests that the temperature and luminos-\nity should be related by T \u221d L1\/2. Temperatures have now\nbeen measured for the diffuse X-ray emission for an extensive\nrange of groups and clusters (David et al. 1993; Ponman et\nal. 1996; Allen & Fabian 1998; Markevitch 1998; Mulchaey\n& Zabludoff 1998; Arnaud & Evrard 1999; Helsdon & Pon-\nman 2000). In contrast to the theoretical prediction, the\nobservations show a much shallower trend, approximately\nT \u221d L1\/3.\nA closely related problem is the evolution of the clus-\nter X-ray luminosity function. Kaiser\u2019s (1986) analysis of\nthe evolution of the X-ray properties of clusters suggested\nthat dense, X-ray luminous associations of galaxies should\nbe more numerous in the intermediate and high redshift uni-\nverse. This possibility was soon ruled out by the initial re-\nsults of the EMSS cluster survey (Gioia et al. 1990; Henry\net al. 1992), which quickly established that clusters in the\ndistant universe have a comparable space density to those of\nthe local universe. This has been confirmed in more recent\nROSAT surveys (eg., Jones et al. 2000).\nInitially, one might have hoped that including radiative\ncooling of the gas (omitted from Kaiser\u2019s analysis) might\nresolve this discrepancy. Unfortunately, it is extremely dif-\nficult to obtain numerically convergent results from simu-\nlations once gas cooling is included. The difficulty is inher-\nent to the problem. Because the universe is dense at early\ntimes, cooling is initially very efficient. This leads to an un-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 Bower, Benson, Baugh, Cole, Frenk & Lacey\nrealistically large fraction of the halo baryon content cooling\nat high redshifts to form very small galaxies. As White &\nRees (1978), White & Frenk (1991), Cole (1991), Sugino-\nhara & Ostriker (1998) and Pearce et al. (2000) amongst\nothers have shown, some form of heating is required to over-\ncome this catastrophe. In Appendix A, we examine how the\ncooled gas fraction depends on cluster mass, and find that\nthe cooled fraction depends too weakly on cluster tempera-\nture to explain the discrepancy. Therefore radiative cooling\ncannot by itself solve the problem with the temperature-\nluminosity relation (see Bryan et al. 2000 and Balogh et al.\n2001 for an extended discussion).\nOne approach to this problem that has given encourag-\ning results is to assume that the gas is \u201cpreheated\u201d before\ncollapsing into the cluster (Evrard & Henry 1991; Kaiser\n1991; Navarro, Frenk & White 1995). This creates an en-\ntropy floor in the gas, ensuring that it remains at low den-\nsities in low mass systems, and results in a much improved\nmatch to the T-L relation (Balogh, Babul & Patton 1999;\nValageas & Silk 1999; Tozzi & Norman 2000). This model\nalso provides an encouraging match to the surface bright-\nness profiles of low mass groups (Ponman et al. 1999). The\nproblem with this model is in explaining the origin of this\ndiffuse heating and its apparent uniformity.\nProlonged heat input from galaxy formation has been\nsuggested as a solution by Wu et al. (1998, 1999a) and Cav-\naliere et al. (2000). They calculated the response of the gas\nprofile to the energy input from supernovae by using a simple\nenergetic approach. They start by assuming a 1-parameter\nform for the gas profile or equation of state and then cal-\nculate how the total energy of the halo gas depends on this\nparameter. By then solving for the dependence of the pa-\nrameter on the energy excess relative to an initial profile\ncorresponding to the case of no heat input, the contribu-\ntions to the energy balance from gravity, radiative cooling\nand supernova heating can be taken into account in calculat-\ning the new gas distribution. This approach successfully ac-\ncounts for the shallow present-day temperature-luminosity\n(T-L) relation if galaxy formation has a roughly uniform effi-\nciency in haloes of different masses. Since the binding energy\nper particle increases with halo mass, while the additional\nheating remains roughly constant, high mass clusters are al-\nmost unaffected while the gas in low mass groups becomes\nunbound.\nIn this paper, we develop a new model for the evolu-\ntion of the masses and density profiles of the hot gas in\ngalaxy, group and cluster haloes, using the semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation scheme of Cole et al. (2000) to predict\nthe evolution of the supernova heating rate in dark haloes\nof different masses, and calculating the response of the gas\nprofile to this heating using a method related to those of\nWu et al. and Cavaliere et al. The semi-analytic scheme is\nan elaboration of that described by Baugh et al. (1998),\nand is based on similar principles to the models described\nby Kauffmann, White & Guiderdoni (1993) and reviewed\nby Somerville & Primack (1999). We apply our model to\nstudy the evolution of the X-ray luminosity function and\nthe temperature-luminosity relation.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. Our method for\nrelating the gas distribution in the halo to the supernova en-\nergy input is presented in \u00a72. The predicted X-ray properties\nare detailed in \u00a73. In section \u00a73.1, we show that supernova\nheating is able to produce the observed slope and normal-\nization of the present-day T-L relation only if the efficiency\nwith which the supernova explosion energy is transferred to\nthe diffuse intracluster medium (ICM) is very high, or if the\nstellar initial mass function (IMF) is tilted to produce an\noverabundance of high-mass stars relative to the IMF in the\nsolar neighbourhood. Alternatively, heat input from AGN\nactivity may be required. In \u00a73.2, we apply this model to\nthe X-ray luminosity function of galaxy clusters. We com-\npare the evolution predicted by the model within a flat,\n\u21260 = 0.3, CDM cosmology with the available observations\nof intermediate redshift clusters. In \u00a73.3, we consider the X-\nray properties of the universe at very high redshifts, and in\n\u00a73.4, we compare the expectations based on our galaxy for-\nmation model with those from two extreme models for the\nredshift evolution of the heat input. A further discussion of\nthe problems and a restatement of our conclusions are given\nin \u00a74 and \u00a75.\n2 THE MODEL\nWu et al. (1998, 1999a) have suggested a simple approach\nthat allows non-gravitational heating to be incorporated into\nthe calculation of the properties of cluster gas. Starting\nfrom a default distribution, gas is redistributed to larger\nand larger radii until the total energy increase matches the\nenergy input from galaxy formation. The effect of heat input\nmay affect the distribution of gas within clusters in a variety\nof ways. Our approach differs from that of Wu et al. both\nin the way we determine the default gas distribution and in\nthe way we modify the gas distribution in response to the\nexcess energy input. Firstly, while Wu et al. adopt a com-\nplex prescription for the default gas distribution based on\nthe cluster\u2019s gravitational binding energy, our default profile\nis based explicitly on the observed properties of high tem-\nperature rich clusters. We are able to do this because the\nranges of excess energy that we consider have little impact\non the gas distribution in these systems. Secondly, Wu et al.\nexplore a variety of models in which heating occurs either\nby uniformly varying the gas temperature, or by varying\nthe polytropic index of the gas. In contrast, our approach is\nempirical and motivated by the observations of Arnaud &\nEvrard (1999) and Lloyd-Davies, Ponman & Cannon (2000)\nwho find that the gas profiles of clusters become systemati-\ncally shallower at lower temperatures. We therefore assume\nthat the overriding effect of heating is to reduce the slope\nof the radial density profile of the gas. Our empirical ap-\nproach does not require us to choose explicitly between the\nisothermal and polytropic regimes. Instead, for our given\ndensity profile, we solve for hydrostatic equilibrium in order\nto determine the gas temperature.\nWe assume that the dark matter density of the halo\nfollows a Navarro, Frenk & White (1997, NFW) profile:\n\u03c1DM(r) =\n\u03c1sa\n3\nr(r + a)2\n(1)\nThe density normalization \u03c1s and dependence of scale ra-\ndius a on halo mass are calculated as described in Cole et\nal. (2000). We parameterize the gas distribution using a con-\nventional \u03b2 model (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1976):\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy Formation and the X-ray Evolution of Clusters 3\n\u03c1gas(r) =\n\u03c1c\n(1 + (r\/rc)2)3\u03b2\/2\n(2)\nBoth of these distributions are assumed to apply within the\nvirial radius Rvir, where Rvir is calculated from a spherical\ncollapse model as described by Cole et al. The first step is\nto fix the parameters of the default radial gas profile that\napplies in the absence of any energy input from supernovae.\nWe initially distribute the gas with a core radius rc that\nis a fixed fraction (7%) of the virial radius Rvir, and set\n\u03b2 = 0.7 in order to match observations of the most massive\nclusters (eg. Lloyd-Davies, Ponman & Cannon 2000). The\ntemperature of the gas at the virial radius is set to 0.6Tvir,\nas suggested by the numerical simulations of Eke, Navarro\n& Frenk (1998) and Frenk et al. (1999). Here the virial tem-\nperature is defined as\nTvir =\n1\n2\n\u00b5mH\nk\nGM\nRvir\n(3)\nwhereM is the total mass within Rvir, \u00b5 is the mean molec-\nular mass (we take \u00b5 = 0.59 for fully ionized gas) and\nmH is the mass of a hydrogen atom. The temperature of\nthe gas at smaller radii is then found by solving for hydro-\nstatic equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the dark\nmatter. This technique accurately reproduces the luminos-\nity weighted temperature of the cluster simulated by Frenk\net al. (1999). We adjust the normalization \u03c1c of the default\ngas profile so that the baryonic mass fraction (ie. gas plus\ngalaxies) enclosed within the virial radius is equal to the\ncosmic baryon fraction. Treating the total mass in this way\ntakes into account the effect of cooled gas and stars that are\nlocked into galaxies, thus reducing the hot gas fraction of\nthe cluster. X-ray luminosities are calculated from the gas\nwithin the cluster virial radius, since material at larger radii\nis unlikely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. In practice, this\ncut-off has little influence on the X-ray luminosity, since that\nis dominated by the densest material in the cluster core.\nHaving established the default profile for a given cluster,\nwe reduce the slope \u03b2 of the gas profile while keeping the\ncore radius rc constant, until the total energy (thermal plus\ngravitational) of the gas is increased by the required amount.\nAs the profile changes, we keep the pressure and density\n(and thus temperature) at the cluster virial radius fixed at\nthe value found for the default profile. This results in the\nmass of gas within the virial radius being less than for the\ndefault profile. The excess gas is assumed to be expelled. It\nis displaced to the virial radius and included in the energy\nbalance calculation, but not in the calculation of the X-ray\nluminosity. The temperature of this material is assumed to\nbe the same as that of the gas at Rvir. This corresponds\nto the lowest plausible temperature for the expelled gas to\nbe both in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings and\nbuoyant with respect to the remaining cluster material.\nWe have chosen the virial radius as the point at which\nto normalize our density profiles because this approximately\ndelineates the region of the cluster that is in dynamical equi-\nlibrium and separates it from the outer parts of the cluster\nthat are dominated by bulk inflow. Outside the virial radius,\nthe gas is unlikely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Close to\nthe virial radius, the infalling gas is shocked so that its bulk\nmotion is converted to internal energy. In the one dimen-\nsional simulations of Knight & Ponman (1997), where the\ninfalling material has uniform initial entropy, the shock ra-\nFigure 1.

The luminosity\nis plotted relative to the luminosity of the default profile. The\ntwo clusters shown have virial temperatures of 1 keV (solid line)\nand 5 keV (dashed line). The kink at LX\/LX(default) \u223c 0.03\ncorresponds to the minimum allowed \u03b2-slope of 0.2. Larger excess\nenergies are accommodated by increasing the temperature of the\ngas. The fraction of the default gas mass remaining within the\ncluster virial radius is shown in Panel (b); while Panel (c) shows\nthe dependence of the slope of the gas density profile, \u03b2, on the\nexcess energy.\ndius occurs at 1-1.5Rvir, in line with the boundary radius\nwe assume here. In three dimensional simulations, the shock\nradius is more poorly defined because the infalling material\nalready has a range of initial entropies and this tends to\nsmooth out the shock, but the same general picture applies.\nThe gas pressure at the virial radius is thus regulated by the\ndynamical pressure of the infalling gas.\nThere is a limit to the overall energy increase that can\nbe accommodated by flattening the gas profile. Rather than\nletting \u03b2 become arbitrarily low, we impose a minimum\nvalue \u03b2min = 0.2. If the required slope falls below this value,\nwe set \u03b2 = \u03b2min, and instead allow the temperature of the\ngas (both inside and outside Rvir) to rise to accommodate\nthe excess energy, giving up the condition T (Rvir) = 0.5Tvir,\nbut maintaining the condition that T = T (Rvir) for the ex-\npelled gas. Since the pressure at Rvir is kept fixed, the gas\ndensity must then fall and a greater fraction of the gas mass\nis expelled. Our results are not sensitive to the exact choice\nof \u03b2min, since the total energy of the cluster depends only\nvery weakly on \u03b2 for \u03b2 < 0.4. The lowest values in observed\nsystems are \u03b2 \u223c 0.35 (Lloyd-Davies, Ponman & Cannon\n2000).\nFigure 1 shows the relation between energy input (ie.\nthe excess energy) per baryon, Ex, and X-ray luminosity LX\nfor clusters with virial temperatures of 1 and 5 keV (Panel\n(a)), and the fraction of the original gas mass that remains\nwithin the cluster virial radius (Panel (b)). Note that the\ndecline in X-ray luminosity is much more rapid than the\ndecline in the gas mass within Rvir. Experimenting with\ndifferent schemes for modelling the effects of heating, such as\nkeeping the mass within Rvir constant, shows that the fixed\npressure assumption is the most effective at reducing the\nX-ray luminosity for a given energy input. For comparison,\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 Bower, Benson, Baugh, Cole, Frenk & Lacey\nPanel (c) shows the dependence of the slope parameter \u03b2 on\nthe injected energy.\nThe effects on the temperature-luminosity relation of\nradiative cooling are discussed in Appendix A. We argue\nthere that radiative cooling will cause some flattening of\nthe T-L relation compared to the case of no cooling and no\nenergy input, but not enough by itself to match the observed\nrelation. This is because, although the fraction of gas inside\nthe cooling radius increases with decreasing halo mass, this\ndependence is too weak in the relevant mass range to flatten\nthe relation to T \u221d L1\/3.\nX-ray luminosities and luminosity-weighted tempera-\ntures for individual dark matter haloes are calculated using\nPeacock\u2019s (1996) analytic fit to the Raymond-Smith cooling\nfunction, assuming a metal abundance of 1\/3 solar. The re-\nsults change by only a few percent if we use the tabulated\ncooling function directly. This includes both bremsstrahlung\nand recombination processes and is adequate for the range of\nhalo masses considered here. Representative halo formation\nand merging histories are generated using a Monte-Carlo\nmethod based on the extended Press-Schechter model as de-\nscribed by Cole et al. (2000). This ensures that our model\nincludes the correct halo mass distribution and assigns col-\nlapse redshifts to individual haloes. We use the properties\nof the halo at its collapse time for determining the X-ray\nproperties.\nWe adopt the cosmological parameters \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 =\n0.7, h = 0.7, \u03c38 = 0.8 and \u0393 = 0.19, where \u039b0 is the cosmo-\nlogical constant measured in units of 3H20\/c\n2, \u03c38 is the linear\ntheory mass variance in spheres of radius 8h\u22121Mpc at the\npresent, and \u0393 is the shape parameter of the initial spectrum\nof density fluctuations defined by Efstathiou, Bond & White\n(1992). With these parameters, our model X-ray tempera-\nture function matches the data of Eke et al. (1996, 1998).\nNote our value of \u03c38 differs slightly from that inferred by Eke\net al. because our luminosity-weighted gas temperatures are\n\u223c15% higher than the cluster virial temperatures that they\nuse. This temperature offset is consistent with the results\nof hydrodynamical simulations of clusters (eg. Frenk et al.\n2000), and depends on the profile adopted for the gas distri-\nbution in the central regions of the clusters (which dominate\nthe X-ray luminosity). In order to match the observed tem-\nperature function, we have lowered \u03c38 from 0.93 to 0.80. We\nretain the \u0393 = 0.19 power spectrum shape preferred by Eke\net al.\nWe normalize the model to fit the observed tempera-\ntures and luminosities of the most luminous X-ray clusters\nby adjusting the cosmic baryon fraction. These clusters are\nalmost unaffected by energy injection. Their predicted lumi-\nnosities scale as LmodelX \u221d \u2126\n2\nbh(1 + zf )\n3\/2T 2 for given values\nof \u21260 and \u039b0 (see Appendix A), while the observationally\ninferred values scale as LobsX \u221d h\n\u22122. Matching models to ob-\nservations, we find that \u2126b = 0.025h\n\u22123\/2 gives a good fit to\nthe observed X-ray luminosities of clusters with virial tem-\nperatures greater than 7 keV. Once the model is normalized\nin this way, the gas fractions within 1.5h\u22121 Mpc are consis-\ntent with more detailed observational estimates.\nWe calculate the amount of energy injected into the\nhalo gas using the detailed semi-analytic model of galaxy\nformation of Cole et al. (2000, GALFORM). This model\nfollows the formation of dark matter halos through hierar-\nchical clustering and merging, using merger histories gen-\nerated by a Monte Carlo scheme, and then calculates the\ncooling and collapse of gas within halos to form galaxies,\nand the formation of stars from the cool gas. The model in-\ncludes the effects of feedback from supernova explosions in\nexpelling cold gas from galaxy disks, and traces the mergers\nof galaxies within common dark matter halos. From the star\nformation history of each galaxy, we can then calculate the\nrate of supernovae as a function of time, once we assume an\nIMF. The model therefore predicts for each dark halo both\nthe total mass of baryons in galaxies, and the total number\nof supernovae that have occurred in galaxies in that halo\nand in its progenitor halos at earlier times. We calculate the\nexcess energy of the hot gas in a particular halo by sum-\nming the energies of all the supernovae that have occurred\nin the progenitors of the halo up to its formation time, after\nallowing for some efficiency for this energy to be transferred\nto the halo gas. Both the excess energy and the fraction of\nbaryons in galaxies have a systematic variation with halo\nmass and a random scatter in haloes of a given mass due to\ndifferent cooling and star formation histories.\nWe ran the GALFORM model with the same param-\neter values (for star formation, feedback, etc) as in Cole\net al. (2000). These values were chosen to match observed\nproperties of present-day galaxies, in particular luminosity\nfunctions, colours and stellar mass-to-light ratios. The GAL-\nFORM model does not include the effects of the modifica-\ntion of the halo gas profile due to energy injection when it\ncalculates the rate of gas cooling, so our modelling is not\nfully self-consistent. A fully self-consistent treatment would\nrequire us to reconsider the form of the star formation law\nand investigate afresh what combination of parameters gives\nthe best fit of predicted to observed galaxy properties in the\npresent-day universe, once we include the effects of energy\ninjection on gas cooling. This self-consistent treatment is\npostponed to a future paper. In the present paper, we have\na more limited aim, which is to investigate the consequences\nfor the X-ray properties of the ICM of including energy in-\njection based on a specific ab initio model of galaxy for-\nmation which has already been shown to reproduce a wide\nrange of observational data on galaxy properties. In a self-\nconsistent calculation, the effect of injection will be to reduce\nthe amount of gas which cools onto galaxies, mimicking the\neffect of reducing \u2126b. For this reason, we allow the value of\n\u2126b used in GALFORM to be smaller than the value used\nin calculating the ICM properties. Specifically, GALFORM\nwas run with \u2126b = 0.02, as in Cole et al. (2000), to calculate\ngalaxy masses and supernova rates. The total baryonic mass\nwas calculated assuming \u2126b = 0.025h\n\u22123\/2 (\u2126b = 0.043 for\nh = 0.7), and the ICM mass calculated as the difference of\nthe total baryon mass and the mass in galaxies.\nWe treat the energy injected into the ICM per unit mass\nof stars formed as a free parameter, which we will adjust in\norder to fit the present-day form of the T-L relation. We\nadopt the parameterisation that an energy \u01ebsn10\n49 erg goes\ninto heating the ICM per M\u2299 of stars formed. There are two\nsources of uncertainty in trying to predict the value of \u01ebsn\nfrom first principles: (a) The number of Type II supernovae\nperM\u2299 of stars formed, \u03b7sn, depends on the IMF and on the\nminimum stellar mass msn for core-collapse. For a Salpeter\nIMF with an upper mass limit of 125M\u2299, lower mass limit\nof 0.1 M\u2299 and msn = 8M\u2299, \u03b7sn = 0.007. The Cole et al.\n(2000) semi-analytic model uses a somewhat different IMF,\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy Formation and the X-ray Evolution of Clusters 5\nthat of Kennicutt (1983), which is a better fit to that ob-\nserved in the solar neighbourhood at m < M\u2299, but this\npredicts the same number of supernovae per unit mass as in\nthe Salpeter case, once the fraction of brown dwarfs (with\nm < 0.1M\u2299) is normalized to match the observed galaxy lu-\nminosity function as in Cole et al. A higher SN rate applies\nif the IMF is skewed towards high mass stars, or if the lower\nmass limit for the progenitors of supernovae is reduced (e.g.\nChiosi et al. 1992). Lower supernova rates are suggested by\nrecent analyses of the metal abundance of the intracluster\nmedium (Renzini, 1997, Kravtsov & Yepes, 2000). (b) Each\nType II supernova explosion releases an energy of about 1051\nergs (eg. Woosley & Weaver 1986), but some fraction of this\nenergy is lost by radiative cooling as the remnant is expand-\ning into the interstellar medium of the host galaxy, and so\nis not available to heat the ICM. For instance, Thornton et\nal. (1998) find that 70-90% of the energy is lost in this way.\nThus, for a Salpeter IMF, we predict \u01ebsn = 0.7 if none of\nthe supernova energy is lost by radiation, but in practice a\nmuch smaller value seems likely.\nWe can convert the heating efficiency \u01ebsn into an excess\nenergy per baryon EX once the fraction of baryons converted\ninto stars fgal is known. For clusters with 1 < T < 10keV,\nour models give fgal \u2248 0.13 for h = 0.7, with only a weak\ndependence on T in this range. This value scales with the\nHubble constant roughly as fgal \u2248 0.16h\n1\/2, if the param-\neters in the semi-analytic model are adjusted to match ob-\nserved galaxy luminosities and mass-to-light ratios at each\nh, resulting in the stellar mass scaling as h\u22121, and if the total\nbaryon fraction is scaled as \u2126b \u221d h\n\u22123\/2 to match the X-ray\nluminosities. The excess energy per baryon in the ICM is\nthen\nEX \u2248 0.50\u01ebsn\n(\nfgal\n0.16h1\/2\n)\nh1\/2keV per particle (4)\nThe value of \u01ebsn that is required to make the model clusters\nfit the observed T-L relation then scales with h approxi-\nmately as h\u22121\/2, since a certain (h-independent) value of\nEX is required at each T to shift the clusters onto the ob-\nserved relation from the relation that applies in the absence\nof heating or cooling.\nAs explained above, we expect the heating efficiency\n\u01ebsn due to supernovae to be significantly less than unity, if\nthe IMF has the standard form and radiative losses are sig-\nnificant. However, additional energy may be available from\nactive galactic nuclei. AGNs may emit mechanical energy\nin the form of winds or jets that can heat the gas in the\nsurrounding dark halo. Although the details of the fuelling\nof AGN activity are unclear (see Nulsen & Fabian 2000, for\na recent discussion), the requirements for this fuelling are\nsimilar to those for star formation, and the two processes\nmay be closely linked. We will assume that the AGN activ-\nity parallels the star formation activity in the galaxies. If all\ngalaxies harbour black holes with masses close to those sug-\ngested by Magorrian et al. (1998), we can estimate the avail-\nable energy as follows. If we assume that the total energy\nreleased by the formation of each black hole of mass MBH is\napproximately 0.1MBHc\n2 (eg., Rees 1984). Magorrian\u2019s rela-\ntion suggests MBH \u223c 0.06Mstars where Mstars is the mass in\nstars (strictly, the bulge mass). Combining these relations\nshows that the available energy is \u223c 1052 ergs per M\u2299 of\nstars, or \u01ebsn = 1000, compared to \u01ebsn \u223c 1 from supernovae.\nThus, the energy contribution to the ICM from AGN could,\nin principle, exceed that from galaxies by several orders of\nmagnitude (depending on the fraction of the AGN luminos-\nity emitted as kinetic energy). For this reason we will allow\nfor the possibility that \u01ebsn > 1.\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 The Temperature-Luminosity Relation\nAs expected, if the ICM is assumed to be heated only by\ngravitational collapse, with no energy injection from galax-\nies, then the model clusters fail to match the observed slope\nof the T-L relation. Data from David et al. (1993) show a\nslope close to T \u221d L1\/3, a result that has been confirmed by\nthe analysis of more recent ASCA observations (Arnaud &\nEvrard 1999). Although, the brightest clusters may follow a\nsteeper slope than this when the luminosities are corrected\nfor contributions from cooling flows (Markevitch 1998; Allen\n& Fabian 1998), the L1\/3 slope extends down to groups of\nmuch lower luminosity (Ponman et al. 1996; Mulchaey &\nZabludoff 1998; Helsdon & Ponman 2000). The X-ray prop-\nerties of our model clusters are compared with observational\ndata in Figure 2, in which the dotted line shows the pre-\ndicted median relation for the case when there is no energy\ninjection. We prefer to plot this relation with temperature\non the vertical axis as the observational uncertainties are far\ngreater for X-ray temperatures than luminosities.\nIn order to match the observed form of the T-L relation,\nit is necessary to introduce very substantial heating of the\nICM. In the upper panel of Fig 2, we show the T-L relation\nat z = 0 in a model with a heating efficiency \u01ebsn = 1.3h\n\u22121\/2.\n(Note that we calculate all our models for h = 0.7, but then\nassume the scaling of \u01ebsn with h that was derived in the pre-\nvious section.) This value of \u01ebsn is already larger than can\nbe accounted for by supernova feedback alone, if the IMF\nhas the conventional solar neighbourhood form, even if there\nare no radiative energy losses. This suggests that a signifi-\ncant contribution from AGN is probably also required. If the\nheating produced by galaxies is smaller than this, the model\npredictions at the bright end fall too steeply with decreas-\ning luminosity. Even with an efficiency of \u01ebsn = 1.3h\n\u22121\/2,\nthe predicted T-L relation seems somewhat too steep for\nthe most luminous clusters (LX > 10\n44h\u22122 ergs s\u22121). These\nclusters are not much affected by this amount of heating\nand tend to follow the self-similar slope. To bring the most\nluminous clusters into line with the observed T-L slope re-\nquires that the energy injection efficiency be increased to\n\u01ebsn = 2.0h\n\u22121\/2 . However, the model then fails to reproduce\nthe presence of X-ray luminous clusters with temperatures\nbelow 1 keV (Fig. 2, lower panel). Thus, it seems that the\nheating efficiency needs to be slightly greater in the progen-\nitor haloes of the most massive clusters, in order to produce\nthe best match to the T-L relation. This might be the case\nif galaxy formation and\/or AGN activity were even more\nstrongly biased to high density regions than in the Cole et\nal. model.\nThe model results show considerable scatter around\nthe median relation, which arises from two sources. Firstly,\nhaloes collapse over a range of redshifts, leading to some\nvariation in core density. Secondly, the efficiency of galaxy\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 Bower, Benson, Baugh, Cole, Frenk & Lacey\nFigure 2. A comparison of the predicted and observed T-L relations for heating efficiencies of \u01ebsn = 1.3h\u22121\/2 (upper panel) and\n\u01ebsn = 2h\u22121\/2 (lower panel). The distribution of model clusters at z = 0 is shown as points, with the thick solid line showing the median\nT at each L. The thick dashed line shows the median T-L relation in this model at z = 0.5. Bold diamonds are observational data points\nfor clusters and groups with z < 0.1 taken from a variety of sources as described in the text; lighter diamonds illustrate the effect of the\naperture correction recommended by Helsdon et al. (2000). The dotted line shows the median T-L relation from a model with \u01ebsn = 0,\ni.e. in which heat input from galaxy formation is turned off. The dot-dashed line shows an estimate of the T-L relation when there is no\nheat input from galaxies, but additional gas is removed following the proceedure described in Appendix A.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy Formation and the X-ray Evolution of Clusters 7\nformation varies from halo to halo, resulting in considerable\nscatter in the level of heating. The scatter in the model is in\nreasonably good agreement with the observational data, al-\nthough it fails to encompass a small number of clusters with\nhigh temperature and low X-ray luminosity. The transient\neffects of cluster mergers are not included in the present\nmodel.\nThe free parameters of the model have now been fixed\nto match the present-day T-L relation, and so the evolution\nto higher redshift provides a test of the model. As discussed\nin the previous section, the evolution of the T-L relation is\ndetermined by a competition between the increasing density\nof collapsed structures, the temperature distribution of the\nclusters and the relative importance of the excess energy.\nThe thick dashed line in Fig. 2 shows the predicted median\nT-L relation at z = 0.5. There is little evolution in this rela-\ntion, consistent with presently available data on distant clus-\nters (Mushotzky & Scharf 1997; Fairley et al. 2000). There\nis a tendency in the model for clusters of a given tempera-\nture to become more X-ray luminous at high redshift, but\nthe trend is too weak to be rejected on the basis of currently\navailable data. Fairley et al. (2000) have analysed the evo-\nlution of the T-L relation in a large sample of clusters from\nz = 0.2 to 0.8. They fit their results to a parameterised form,\nL \u221d T 3.15(1 + z)\u03b7, and derive \u03b7 = 0.60 \u00b1 0.38 for an open\n\u21260 = 0.3 universe. This corresponds to \u03b7 = 0.75 \u00b1 0.48 in\nour flat cosmology, since the luminosities inferred from the\ndata are then greater. At T = 5 keV our model produces a\nfactor of 1.86 increase in the median cluster luminosity over\nthe redshift interval 0.0 to 0.5, corresponding to \u03b7 = 1.54.\nThus, the evolution predicted by our model is compatible\n(at 1.6\u03c3) with that observed by Fairley et al.\n3.2 The X-ray Luminosity Function\nThe heating model provides a good description of the\npresent-day T-L relation, and can account for its observed\nlack of evolution. We now consider the X-ray luminosity\nfunction (XLF). Since the galaxy formation model generates\na statistical sample of haloes, the X-ray luminosity function\ncan be readily calculated by combining the different halos\nwith appropriate weights. In Fig. 3 we show the predicted\nluminosity functions at z = 0 (solid line) and z = 0.5 (dot-\nted line). We show the luminosity function that is derived\nwithout heating (ie., \u01ebsn = 0) in the top panel. The middle\nand lower panels correspond to the values of the efficiency\nparameter, \u01ebsn = 1.3 h\n\u22121\/2 and \u01ebsn = 2 h\n\u22121\/2 respectively,\nchosen to match the observed temperature-luminosity rela-\ntion. These predictions are compared to the observed local\nluminosity function derived by Ebeling et al (1997) from the\nROSAT all-sky \u201cBright Cluster\u201d survey (BCS).\nWithout heating, the model is an extremely poor fit\nto the observed data: this is expected since we have chosen\nthe CDM power spectrum to match the observed cluster\ntemperature function. In this case the luminosities of low\ntemperature haloes are too high, and this is reflected in the\nluminosity function which is too steep. Since the available\nXLF data are restricted to relatively bright clusters, we ex-\npect to obtain the best fit with \u01ebsn = 2.0 h\n\u22121\/2 rather than\nwith \u01ebsn = 1.3 h\n\u22121\/2. This is indeed the case, although even\nfor \u01ebsn = 2.0 h\n\u22121\/2 the model luminosity function is still\nsomewhat too steep. The discrepancy can be traced back to\nFigure 3. Upper panel: the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) at\nz = 0 (solid) and at z = 0.5 (dotted) for the case when there is no\nheating (\u01ebsn = 0). The dashed line shows the observed present-\nday luminosity function of Ebeling et al. (1997), with the shaded\nregion illustrating the statistical uncertainty. Middle Panel: the\nluminosity function derived for the case \u01ebsn = 1.3h\u22121\/2; lines\nas in the previous panel. Lower panel: as above, but for \u01ebsn =\n2.0h\u22121\/2.\nthe slight bend in the T-L relation seen in Fig. 2, at the tem-\nperature at which the effect of the injected energy becomes\nsignificant. The fit could be fine-tuned by making the energy\ninput increase more strongly with halo mass (eg. if galaxy\nformation were more efficient in proto-cluster regions), or by\nadjusting the cosmological parameters. For example, adopt-\ning \u03c38 = 0.73 and \u0393 = 0.07 reduces the number of small\nmass haloes while boosting the abundance of the highest\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n8 Bower, Benson, Baugh, Cole, Frenk & Lacey\nmass objects. This gives a significantly improved match to\nthe luminosity function, but such a small value of \u0393 may not\nbe compatible with measurements of large-scale galaxy clus-\ntering (Peacock & Dodds, 1994, Hoyle et al., 1999, Eisenstein\n& Zaldarriaga, 2000).\nBelow the limits probed by the BCS data, the model\npredicts a significant flattening of the luminosity function.\nThis is an unavoidable consequence of energy injection: in\nlow mass haloes, most of the gas is ejected, resulting in\nvery low luminosities and a \u2018stretching\u2019 of the luminosity\nfunction in this region. The space density of low-luminosity\n(LX < 10\n42h\u22122 ergs s\u22121) systems is therefore a strong test\nof this model. The absence of luminous haloes around spi-\nral galaxies reported by Benson et al. (2000) supports this\naspect of the model.\nThe evolution of the luminosity function is another im-\nportant test of the model. The dotted line in Fig 3 shows\nthe XLF at z = 0.5. This evolves very little relative to the\npresent-day function. The results from the weak evolution\nof the temperature function in this cosmological model (Eke\net al. 1998) combined with the weak trend of increasing lu-\nminosities with higher redshift at fixed temperature seen\nin Fig 2. The model predictions compare very favourably\nwith the available measurements from deep ROSAT sur-\nveys (eg. Scharf et al. 1997; Rosati et al. 1998; Vikhlinin\net al. 1998; Nichol et al. 1999; Jones et al. 2000) which\nshow no significant evolution of the luminosity function over\nthe redshift range 0 < z < 0.8. The evolution seen at the\nbright end is, however, sensitive to the CDM power spec-\ntrum adopted. For instance, the \u03c38 = 0.73, \u0393 = 0.07 model\ndiscussed above would imply that the most massive clusters\n(LX > 5\u00d7 10\n44h\u22122 ergs s\u22121) should have significantly lower\nspace density at z = 0.5 than at the present day. It is un-\nclear whether this is supported by current X-ray data (see\nJones et al. 2000 for a discussion).\n3.3 X-ray Emission in the High-Redshift Universe\nWe can use the model to predict the evolution of the X-\nray emission from haloes out to high redshifts (z > 2). The\nCole et al. (2000) model of galaxy formation and evolution\nmatches reasonably well observations of the evolution of the\ncosmic star formation rate over these long look-back times.\nWe can thus predict the evolution of the supernova heating\nrate out to very high redshift, as is required in order to\nmodel the evolution of the XLF at high redshifts. We focus\non the \u01ebsn = 2.0 h\n\u22121\/2 model in what follows, because this\nproduces the best fit to the present-day XLF.\nThe model predictions for the T-L relation and the XLF\nat z = 0 and z = 2 are shown in Fig. 4. At a given temper-\nature, high-z clusters are substantially more luminous than\ntheir present-day counterparts. However, because of hierar-\nchical clustering, high temperature systems are increasingly\nrare at high redshift. At z = 2, this decline in abundance\noffsets the modest increase in X-ray luminosity at given T .\nAs a result, even at z = 2 the luminosity function is pre-\ndicted to be close to that observed at the present-day. This\nis consistent with observational limits on the contribution of\nclusters to the X-ray background (e.g. Burg et al. 1993 and\nWu et al. 1999b).\nFigure 4. Predictions for the X-ray universe at z = 2. Upper\npanel: the T-L relation (triangles: z = 0, squares: z = 2). Lower\npanel: the X-ray luminosity function (solid: z = 0, dotted: z = 2).\nBoth panels assume \u01ebsn = 2.0h\u22121\/2. The observational relations\nat z = 0 are also plotted for comparison.\n3.4 The Epoch of Galaxy Formation\nWe have argued that the slope of the temperature-\nluminosity relation reflects the energy input from galax-\nies and AGNs. Now we examine whether the evolution\nof clusters can be used to constrain the epoch at which\nthis heating occurs. We contrast the galform model (with\n\u01ebsn = 2.0 h\n\u22121\/2) with two simple ad hoc heating models. In\nthe first, the heating occurs at a constant rate over cosmic\ntime (model A); in the second, the heating occurs only at\nhigh redshift so that the excess energy remains constant be-\nlow z = 2.0 (model B). Model B is intended to mimic the\neffect of \u201cpre-heating\u201d of the intergalactic medium as in the\nmodel proposed by (eg.) Balogh et al. (1999). The total en-\nergy injection has been adjusted to match the present-day\nXLF of the galform model. Models A and B give XLFs at\nz = 0 which are almost identical to that from GALFORM,\nwhen normalized by this procedure.\nWe contrast these two simple models with our fiducial\nmodel based on hierarchical galaxy formation in Figure 5.\nThe upper panel shows the median T-L relations predicted\nby each of the models at z = 2. Similar but less pronounced\ndifferences exist at z = 1 and at z = 0.5. The models diverge\nat low luminosities since the relative effect of the injected en-\nergy is greatest for small clusters. It is not surprising that the\ndifferences between the models at the bright end are small,\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nGalaxy Formation and the X-ray Evolution of Clusters 9\nFigure 5. Predicted cluster properties at z = 2 for different\nmodels for the redshift dependence of the heating. Upper panel:\nthe temperature-luminosity relation for the galform model com-\npared to (A) a model in which the heating occurs at a uniform\nrate (dotted line) and (B) a model in which the heating occurs\nat high redshift (dashed line). Lower panel: the X-ray luminosity\nfunction for the same models at z = 2.\nas the heat input is fairly unimportant for these clusters. As\nexpected, the two simple heating models bracket the gal-\nform model, although the latter seems closer to model B in\nwhich the heating occurs at high redshift. This reflects the\nfact that galaxy formation in proto-cluster regions is accel-\nerated relative to that in an average region of the universe,\nsimply due to the higher density there.\nThe lower panel in Fig. 5 shows the differences between\nthe luminosity functions at z = 2 for the three models. As\nexpected from the upper panel, the two simple models again\nbracket the behaviour of galform. The luminosity function\nfor the constant heating model shows stronger positive evo-\nlution (ie. a higher number density at higher redshift) than\nthe model in which the heating has already occurred before\nthis epoch. These differences offer an interesting possibility\nfor determining the epoch of galaxy formation: if it becomes\npossible to distinguish between different models for the red-\nshift dependence of the heating using X-ray observations,\nthis will then provide a strong constraint on the epoch at\nwhich most of the stars in the universe formed.\n4 DISCUSSION\nAs we have shown, a model in which the intracluster gas is\nheated as galaxy formation proceeds provides a good expla-\nnation for the slope of the T-L relation and for the evolution\nof the X-ray luminosity function. The problem with associ-\nating this heating with supernovae is the large amount of\nenergy that is required, between 1.3 and 2.0 \u00d71049h\u22121\/2 erg\nper solar mass of stars formed. This corresponds to an en-\nergy of 0.6 \u2013 1.0 keV per particle in the intracluster medium.\nThis is comparable to the energy injection requirement (1\n\u2013 2 keV per particle) derived by Wu et al. (1999a), show-\ning that the conclusions about the energetics do not depend\ngreatly on the details of the heating model. Even with op-\ntimistic assumptions about the supernova rate, this amount\nof heating would require that the energy of the supernova\nexplosions be transferred to the intergalactic plasma with\nan efficiency close to unity. This seems unrealistic.\nAn alternative source for heating the ICM is AGNs and\nquasars. If AGN activity is closely linked to the fuelling of\nstar formation, then such activity will effectively enhance the\nvalue of \u01ebsn. In this case, the effect of AGN heating can easily\nbe incorporated into our model. Our conclusions would be\nunchanged apart from the interpretation of \u01ebsn. If, on the\nother hand, the energy input comes predominantly from the\nmost powerful AGN early in the history of the universe, it\nwould be more appropriate to treat the energy injection as a\nuniform preheating of the gas prior to gravitational collapse\nof the dark matter halos. Assuming the energy sources were\nsufficiently uniformly distributed, the effects of the heating\nmight be better modeled by assuming that the gas entropy\nis raised to some uniform value before collapse (eg. Evrard\n& Henry 1991; Navarro, Frenk & White 1995; Bower 1997;\nBalogh, Babul & Patton 1999; Valageas & Silk 1999). A\npossible problem of this scheme is the high temperature it\nimplies for the diffuse IGM. For example, Balogh, Babul &\nPatton (1999) require a temperature of 1.8 \u00d7 106 K for a\npreheating epoch of z = 3 in our \u039bCDM cosmology. This\nis in stark contrast to the IGM temperature estimated from\nthe Doppler widths of Ly-\u03b1 forest lines. For example, Theuns\net al (2000) estimate TIGM \u223c 15, 000 K at this redshift.\nThus, unless the clouds giving rise to the Ly-\u03b1 forest or the\nprecursor gas of the ICM are atypical, a model in which\nthe heating occurs within already virialised haloes seems\npreferable.\nDark haloes build up by mergers of smaller progenitor\nhalos. Although we include energy input from the complete\nhistory of star formation in each halo, we assume that the\nway this heating is distributed between the earlier haloes is\nunimportant. In particular, we ignore any dependence of the\nenergy released during the gravitational collapse of a halo\non the distribution of the gas in the progenitor halos. If the\ngas has already been heated by supernovae or AGN in the\nprogenitor halos, then the dynamics of the collapse of the\ngas and its shock heating will be modified. It is quite pos-\nsible that this effect could give rise to an \u201camplification\u201d\nof an initial energy excess, thus easing the requirements on\nthe heating efficiency. Another limitation of our approach\nis that we have only included the effects of cooling in an\napproximate way, by removing from the ICM the gas which\nshould have cooled to low temperature, based on a calcu-\nlation which does not explicitly include the effects of the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n10 Bower, Benson, Baugh, Cole, Frenk & Lacey\nenergy injection. However, the cooling rates will be modi-\nfied by the effects of the energy injection, and conversely\nsome of the excess energy may be lost by radiative cooling.\nIt is clearly vital to understand all of these processes bet-\nter, which can best be done through well-targeted numerical\nsimulations (eg. Pearce et al. 2000).\nFinally, we must recall that galaxy formation and X-\nray evolution have not been treated in a fully self-consistent\nfashion in this paper. We have taken the successful gal-\nform model of galaxy formation, with the same parameters\nas in Cole et al. (2000), and used it to predict the energy\ninjection and thus the evolution of cluster and group X-ray\nproperties. In practice, we should use the methods devel-\noped here to calculate the gas density profiles of all haloes\nat each epoch, as modified by the energy injection, compute\ngas cooling rates using these modified profiles, and then cal-\nculate the energy injection from the resultant star formation\nhistories. This represents a large computational overhead on\nthe standard galform model, but is clearly an important\nnext step to take.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we have addressed the problem of why the ob-\nserved properties of X-ray clusters do not conform to simple\nscaling relations. In particular, we have considered why the\nobserved correlation between X-ray temperature and X-ray\nluminosity is significantly shallower than the adiabatic scal-\ning solution, while the X-ray luminosity function evolves less\nrapidly than predicted in popular cold dark matter cosmolo-\ngies. First, we argued that the effects of gas cooling in clus-\nters (which break the scaling relations) do not resolve the\nproblem. We then considered the heating of the intracluster\ngas by the energy released during galaxy formation, by com-\nbining the semi-analytic model of Cole et al. (2000) with a\nsimple model for the radial profile of the intracluster gas.\nOur main conclusions, applicable in the \u039bCDM cosmology,\nmay be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Heat input into the intracluster gas by processes asso-\nciated with the formation of cluster galaxies, such as su-\npernovae and\/or AGN winds, will flatten the slope of the\ntemperature-luminosity relation. The combined model gives\na reasonable match to the observations if energy is injected\nat a level of 1.3\u20132.0 \u00d71049h\u22121\/2 ergs per solar mass of stars\nformed (or, equivalently, 0.6\u20131 keV per particle in the intra-\ncluster medium). Values within this range produce broadly\nacceptable models, but lower values result in a better match\nto groups with T \u2248 1 keV, while higher values produce a\nbetter match to the most massive clusters.\n\u2022 The interplay between the ongoing energy injection\nfrom galaxies and the growth of clusters by hierarchical clus-\ntering causes the T \u2212L relation to evolve little to moderate\nredshifts. This is consistent with recent data based on ASCA\nobservations.\n\u2022 The present-day X-ray luminosity function in the model\napproximately matches observations, but the model over-\nproduces low luminosity groups and under-produces very\nluminous clusters. Fine tuning the cosmological parameters\nor other details of the model may remove these discrepan-\ncies.\n\u2022 Similar factors to those that regulate the evolution of\nthe T \u2212 L relation result in only weak evolution of the lu-\nminosity function to z = 0.5. This too is consistent with\ncurrent data.\n\u2022 The properties of clusters at high redshift provide a test\nof the model, since all of the free parameters are fixed to\nachieve agreement with present-day data. In particular, the\nmodel predicts little evolution in the X-ray luminosity func-\ntion even out to z = 2. The predicted near constancy of the\nluminosity function is testable with the current generation\nof X-ray satellites.\n\u2022 The main difficulty of our model is that it requires an\namount of energy injected per unit mass of stars formed\nwhich is comparable to the total energy available from su-\npernovae. This would require the supernova explosion energy\nto couple to the intracluster gas with very high efficiency,\nwith minimal losses by radiative cooling during the expan-\nsion of the supernova remnants through the ISM of the host\ngalaxies. However, additional energy sources associated with\ngalaxy formation may also contribute, such as the mechan-\nical energy liberated by AGN winds. Alternatively (or ad-\nditionally), an initial heat input to the intracluster medium\nmight be amplified during the build-up of the cluster by\nmergers. Detailed numerical simulations are required to test\nthe effectiveness of this process.\nOur work demonstrates that the shape and evolution of\nthe X-ray luminosity function and T-L relation are poten-\ntially powerful probes of the mode and efficiency of galaxy\nformation. Future observations with Newton and Chandra\nshould be able to test these ideas.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThanks to Ed Lloyd-Davies and Trevor Ponman for ex-\ntensive discussions and to Simon White for valuable sug-\ngestions.

Kaiser 1986, 1991; Evrard & Henry 1991; Bower 1997;\nKay & Bower 1999). We have explicitly included the depen-\ndence on the collapse redshift of the cluster, zf , to make it\nclear that the scaling depends on this rather than on the\nredshift at which the cluster is observed.\nAs we have discussed, the T-L relation implied by\neqn. (A2) is too steep compared with the observed lumi-\nnosities and temperatures of clusters. Eqn. (A2) suggests\nthat the relation might be made shallower if lower tempera-\nture clusters had systematically lower collapse redshifts. In\nhierarchical models, however, smaller mass clusters are ex-\npected to collapse at higher redshifts \u2014 the opposite to the\nrequired trend.\nIn this appendix, we will use simple scaling arguments\nto argue that the effects of radiative cooling by itself are not\nsufficient to bring the predicted T-L relation into line with\nthe observed one. The effects of radiative cooling on the den-\nsity and temperature profiles, and thus X-ray luminosities,\nof spherical clusters have been the subject of various ana-\nlytical (e.g. Bertschinger 1989) and numerical (e.g. Lufkin\net al. 2000) investigations. These studies show that outside\nthe cooling radius rcool, defined such that the local radiative\ncooling time is equal to the age of the system, the density\nand temperature are almost unchanged from their initial val-\nues. Inside rcool, the gas flows in and then drops out of the\nflow completely due to radiative cooling. In the case that\nthe initial density profile is steep, this results in a reduction\nin the gas density within rcool, and thus also a reduction in\nLX, On the other hand, if the initial density profile is very\nshallow, then the gas density and LX may be boosted.\nConsider first the simple case that the gas density pro-\nfile is that of a singular isothermal sphere, \u03c1(r) \u221d \u03c10(1 +\nzf)\n3(r\/Rvir)\n2, with T = Tvir. We define rcool as the radius\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n12 Bower, Benson, Baugh, Cole, Frenk & Lacey\nwhere the local cooling time equals the age of the universe\ntH (we choose the age of the universe rather than that of\nthe halo in order to derive the maximum effect of cooling).\nThus:\ntcool(rcool) \u221d \u03c1(rcool)\n\u22121T (rcool)\/\u039b(T ) \u221d tH. (A3)\n(Note that we suppress the dependence on the gas fraction\nfg in this and the following equations.) The fraction of the\ngas which is able to cool is then\nfcool =\nrcool\nRvir\n\u221d\n(\n\u03c10(1 + zf)\n3T\u22121\/2tH\n)1\/2\n. (A4)\nThe self-similar cooling flow solutions of Bertschinger (1989)\nshow that the density profile flattens to \u03c1 \u221d r\u22123\/2 within\nrcool, so the X-ray luminosity scales as\nLX \u221d r\n3\ncool\u03c1(rcool)\n2\u039b(T ) \u221d\nT 2\u03c1\n1\/2\n0 (1 + zf)\n3\/2\nfcool\n. (A5)\nThe greater the fraction of gas that is able to cool, the more\nthe luminosity is reduced below that of eqn. (A2). Substi-\ntuting equation (A4) for fcool, we then find\nLX \u221d T\n9\/4t\n\u22121\/2\nH . (A6)\nThis only slightly improves the match to the data compared\nto the case of no cooling. For high temperature clusters,\nthe relation becomes slightly shallower than before, but the\neffect is not sufficient. Moreover, in cooler clusters, the emis-\nsivity is enhanced by recombination radiation and the slope\nof the T-L relation becomes steeper again.\nThe above equations apply in the case that the initial\ngas density profile is singular. If, as is more realistic, the gas\nprofile initially has a core of radius rc within which the den-\nsity is constant, then the behaviour is modified. The cooling\ntime will be constant within the core, so the density profile\nwill remain almost unchanged until the age of the system is\nequal to this cooling time, and LX will approximately follow\nequation (A2). As a cooling flow starts up within the core,\nthe X-ray luminosity may be enhanced, but at most by a fac-\ntor of a few. The cooling radius rcool will then grow beyond\nthe core radius rc, and LX will converge towards the be-\nhaviour in equation (A6). Thus, LX will scale approximately\nas (A2) for tH < tcool(rc) and as (A6) for tH > tcool(rc), and\nour previous conclusions about the T-L relation not being\nreproduced remain unchanged.\nAn estimate of the effects of cooling based on our \u03b2-\nmodel approach is shown by the dot-dashed line in Figure 2.\nStarting from the default halo gas profile, we have calcu-\nlated the gas mass within the cooling radius for each of the\nsimulated haloes. This gas is removed, and the \u03b2-profile is\nthen adjusted so that the remaining gas mass is distributed\nwithin the virial radius using the same boundary conditions\nas discussed in \u00a72, keeping rc constant but reducing \u03b2. (If\ninstead rc is varied and \u03b2 kept constant, the resulting T-\nL relation is very similar.) The T-L relation that results is\nclose to that predicted by the scaling arguments discussed\nabove, and fails to match the observed data.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n"}
