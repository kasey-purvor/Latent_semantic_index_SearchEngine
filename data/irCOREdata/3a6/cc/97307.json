INTRODUCTION\nEmergence can be defined as the appearance of rich struc-\ntures on a large scale resulting from a multiplicity of simple\ninteractions at a considerably smaller scale. Collective ani-\nmal motion is a paradigmatic example of such an emergent\nphenomenon. Depending on the species, there may exist dif-\nferent hierarchical levels that determine how collective dis-\nplacements are realized. For example, in primate groups, an\nindividual\u2019s dominance status can affect its role in initializ-\ning collective movement. In the case of swarming locusts, no\nsuch hierarchies are present; the ability of each individual to\nguide the band appears to be distributed relatively evenly\nthroughout the insect group. Herein, we will concentrate on\ngroups of wingless locust nymphs which form marching\nbands rather than flying swarms \u00031\u0004. The onset of collective\nmotion in locusts was experimentally demonstrated in \u00031\u0004,\nwhere it was shown that sufficiently large insect densities\nplaced in a ring-shaped arena gave rise to a coherent dis-\nplacement of the band. Low densities were characterized by\nrandom dispersal of the individuals, while for intermediate\ndensities the coherent motion was interrupted by sudden\nchanges of direction \u0001hereafter referred to as \u201cswitches\u201d\u0002.\nThis phenomenology was partially rationalized by means of\nan adapted model based on that of Czir\u00f3k et al. \u00032\u0004, who\nformulate a paradigmatic model for collective animal behav-\nior in one dimension. In their original model the position, xi,\nand velocity, ui, of locust i are evolved using the following\ntwo rules, identical for each individual, i=1, . . . ,N,\nxi\u0001t + 1\u0002 = xi\u0001t\u0002 + v0ui\u0001t\u0002 ,\nui\u0001t + 1\u0002 = G\u0001u\u00afi\u0002 + \u0003i,\nwhere N is the total number of locusts. Here u\u00afi is the mean of\nthe nondimensionalized velocities of locusts within a certain\nradius, R, of the position, xi, of locust i. The function G is\nsuch that G\u0001u\u0002= \u00011+K\u0002\u22121\u0003u+K sgn\u0001u\u0002\u0004 for a positive con-\nstant K, where sgn\u0001u\u0002 denotes the sign of u. The role of G is\nto adjust the average nondimensionalized velocity perceived\nby each particle toward unity. v0 is a constant associated with\nthe chosen time scale and \u0003i is a random number drawn from\nthe uniform distribution in \u0003\u2212\u0004 \/2,\u0004 \/2\u0004. The adapted version\nof the model used in \u00031\u0004 to model the movements of locust\nnymphs in a quasi-one-dimensional arena takes the form\ndxi\ndt\n= ui, dui = \u0003G\u0001u\u00afi\u0002 \u2212 ui\u0004dt + \u00051dWi, for i = 1, . . . ,N ,\n\u00011\u0002\nwhere dWi denotes the increments of independent Wiener\nprocesses, \u00051 is a positive constant describing the amplitude\nof the noise and the function G is as above.\nA biologically motivated refinement of the model de-\nscribed by Eq. \u00011\u0002 was given in \u00033\u0004, where it was postulated\nthat individual locusts increase the randomness of their\nmovements in response to a loss of group alignment. This\nbehavior is the result of a particular multiplicative form of\nthe noise term \u0003see Eq. \u00012\u0002\u0004, as opposed to the additive noise\nin Eq. \u00011\u0002; this characteristic was shown to increase the co-\nherence of the group motion and to reduce the frequency of\ndirection switches \u00033\u0004.

In the present work, we approxi-\nmate the drift and diffusion coefficients of the effective FPE\nby analytical functions. This permits a more thorough analy-\nsis and fosters further understanding of collective dynamics\nof locusts. In addition we compare our results with those of\nEq. \u00011\u0002, and discuss the disparities between the two models.\nII. MODEL\nCoarse-grained analysis \u00034\u0004 allows us to obtain an effec-\ntive FPE describing the collective behavior of the locusts at\nthe macroscopic level. By using this coarse-graining tech-\nnique \u0001see \u00033\u0004\u0002 we were able to extract the coefficients of the\nassumed underlying FPE describing the alignment of the lo-\ncusts from the experimental data presented in \u00031\u0004. This ap-\nproach enables us to reduce our system\u2014comprising a large\nnumber of degrees of freedom\u2014to a single collective vari-\nable, u, \u0001referred to variably, hereafter, as \u201calignment\u201d or\n\u201caverage velocity\u201d\u0002 which characterizes the system\u2019s macro-\nscopic behavior. The proposed FPE has a simple form and it\ncan be expressed as\n\u0001tP = \u2212 \u00062\u0001u\u0005\u0006u \u2212 u31 \u2212 u2\u0007P\b + \u00052N \u0001uu\u0003\u00011 \u2212 u2\u0002P\u0004 , \u00012\u0002\nfor the probability P\u0001u , t\u0002dudt of finding the system with an\naverage velocity in the interval \u0001u ,u+du\u0002 during the time\ninterval \u0001t , t+dt\u0002; note that the experimental situation in \u00031\u0004\nis quasi-one-dimensional, allowing the use of a one-\ndimensional FPE \u00033\u0004. We note that this FPE corresponds to\nthe following Langevin equation for the average velocity\ndu = \u00062\u0006u \u2212 u31 \u2212 u2\u0007dt +\t2\u00052N \t1 \u2212 u2dW , \u00013\u0002\nwhere dW denotes the increments of a Wiener process and\nthe multiplicative noise is interpreted in the It\u00f4 sense, as\nprescribed by the experimentally obtained FPE \u00012\u0002. In these\nequations the average velocity u is dimensionless and takes\nits values in the interval \u0003\u22121,1\u0004. The values such that \nu\n\n=1 characterize the ideal situation in which all locusts march\nin perfect coherence; the sign determines the direction. Of\ncourse, formally substituting \nu\n=1 in Eq. \u00013\u0002 produces a\ndivergence in the drift, so for practical reasons one has to\nassume that coherent motion implies \nu\n\u00071 rather than a\nstrict equality. The value u=0 characterizes a total disorder;\nrealistic values of the average velocity lie between these two\nextreme cases. Although the average velocity is a dimension-\nless quantity in Eqs. \u00012\u0002 and \u00013\u0002, time is not. Consequently \u00062\nand \u00052 have the dimensions of time\u22121. We shall estimate in\nthe following their numerical values using the experimental\ndata from \u00031\u0004 and express them in units of seconds\u22121.\nThe proposed FPE \u00012\u0002 describing the alignment is a rea-\nsonably accurate approximation to the unknown FPE as-\nsumed to underly the motion of the locusts, which captures\ntheir experimental swarming behavior. It should be noted\nthat such an equation can only be obtained if the system\nbeing studied is amenable to this sort of reduction.\nFor asymptotically large values of N, parameter \u00062\n\u22121 \u0003in\nEq. \u00012\u0002\u0004 denotes the order of magnitude of the relaxation\ntime characterizing how long it takes the entire group to\nbecome ordered when starting from a disordered configura-\ntion, and N\u00052\n\u22121 indicates the order of magnitude of the char-\nacteristic time over which the fluctuations of the mean ve-\nlocity develop. For the range of experimentally considered\nlocust numbers \u00015\bN\b40\u0002 the observed values of \u00062 and\n\u00052 are approximately constant while we expect the presence\nof a boundary layer for smaller values of N. Since our results\nin \u00033\u0004 are rather noisy our goal is to fit the order of magni-\ntude of the model parameters instead of attempting to obtain\nprecise estimates. Comparing the proposed analytical coeffi-\ncients of Eq. \u00012\u0002 to those obtained in \u00033\u0004, from the experi-\nmental data in \u00031\u0004, we obtain \u00052 \/\u00062=2.4\t1.7. Employing\nthe mean switching time measurements in \u00033\u0004 we find \u00062\n= \u00016.65\t2.63\u000210\u22124 s\u22121 and \u00052= \u00011.62\t0.52\u000210\u22123 s\u22121.\nThe FPE corresponding to Eq. \u00011\u0002 can be obtained as a\nmean-field approximation,\n\u0001tP = \u2212 \u00061\u0001u\u000b\u0003sgn\u0001u\u0002 \u2212 u\u0004P\f +\n\u00051\nN\n\u0001uuP , \u00014\u0002\nwhere \u00061=K \/ \u00011+K\u0002 and K is defined as for the function G\nin Eq. \u00011\u0002.

For\nthe biologically motivated FPE \u00012\u0002 the SPD shows one mini-\nmum always located at umin=0, and two maxima at umax\n=\t\t\u00062+2\u00052 \/N \/\t2\u00062+2\u00052 \/N, which exist for all param-\neter values.

For increasing noise intensity the probability\nmaxima of the SPD Eq. \u00016\u0002 \u0003corresponding to the biologi-\ncally motivated FPE \u00012\u0002\u0004 separate from the deterministic po-\ntential minima \t1 \/\t2 and approach the boundary points\n\t1. These facets of the SPD, when considered in the context\nof the classical theory of noise induced transitions, imply\nthat the system is becoming ordered \u00038\u0004: the SPD maxima,\nrepresenting the states in which the system will most likely\nbe found, are further apart and thus there is a clearer differ-\nentiation between those states. However, the experimental\nevidence, based on switching times which decrease as the\nnoise magnitude increases, reveals that the system becomes\ndisordered \u00031\u0004. This indicates that for complex systems, re-\nstricting the characterization of the dynamics to observations\nof the evolution of the extrema may not be adequate in some\nexperimentally motivated situations. Herein we will try to\ncarry out a more complete characterization.\nIII. BARRIER HEIGHT\nAnother indicator of order and\/or disorder is the barrier\nheight of the effective potential.

In short, the \u201cbarrier\nheight\u201d order parameter shows a clear nonmonotonicity\nwhen considered as a function of noise strength. This appears\nlike a counterintuitive reentrant behavior, where the noise\ncan have an ordering effect for supercritical intensities \u00038\u0004.\nAlthough this behavior is interesting in itself, it is not bio-\nlogically relevant, as it requires a number of individuals N\n\u00103, beyond the validity of the model. Both characteristics of\nthe SPD Eq. \u00016\u0002 of our refined model, displacement of the\nlocation of the maxima and nonmonotonic variation of the\nbarrier height, can be seen in Figs. 1\u0001a\u0002 and 1\u0001b\u0002.\nLet us note that noise induced nonequilibrium phase tran-\nsitions \u00039,10\u0004 as well as other noise mediated ordering phe-\nnomena \u000311\u0004 have been exhaustively studied in the literature.\nThis includes the detailed study of reentrant transitions \u000312\u0004.\nHowever, most of these approaches have assumed multipli-\ncative noise interpreted in the Stratonovich sense. The Stra-\ntonovich interpretation is able to destabilize a deterministi-\ncally stable state and in this way produce phase transitions or\nother noise induced phenomena. The key technical point in\nthese cases is the appearance of a systematic contribution to\nthe deterministic dynamics coming from the noise term, the\nso-called \u201cStratonovich drift\u201d \u00038\u0004.

In this respect, our results are fundamentally different as\nwe only consider the It\u00f4 interpretation for our Langevin\nequation with multiplicative noise Eq. \u00013\u0002. We also note that\nnoise induced phase transitions which are independent of the\nnoise interpretation have also been studied \u000313\u0004, but in much\nless detail. The mechanisms leading to these phase transi-\ntions are based on the bifurcation of the minima of an effec-\ntive potential due to noise and, as such, constitute the natural\nextension of noise induced transitions \u00038\u0004 to spatially ex-\ntended systems. Our results relate to a zero dimensional sys-\ntem as do those in \u00038\u0004, but they are significantly different as\nthe model defined by Eq. \u00013\u0002 does not describe this kind of\nbifurcation.\nIV. MEAN SWITCHING TIME\nWe can further explore the model properties by consider-\ning the mean switching time, T\u0001u\u0002, defined as the first time,\non average, that the alignment of the system, u, initialized\nsuch that \u22121\fu\f0, reaches the origin \u0001u=0\u0002. For our re-\nvised model the moments of the switching time distribution\nare given, recursively, by the solution of the equation\n\u00062\u0006u \u2212 u31 \u2212 u2\u0007\u0001uTn + \u00052N \u00011 \u2212 u2\u0002\u0001uuTn = \u2212 nTn\u22121, \u000111\u0002\nsubject to the boundary conditions T\u00010\u0002=0 and T\u0001\u0001\u22121\u0002=0,\nwhere Tn is the nth moment, correspondingly, T\u000fT1 is the\nmean switching time and T0\u000f1. The second boundary con-\ndition represents zero probability flux through u=\u22121. Equa-\ntion \u000111\u0002 is directly derived from the FPE using methods\nfrom \u000314\u0004. The solution to this equation for n=1 is\nT\u0001u\u0002 =\nN\n\u00052\n\u000e\nu\n0\nexp\u0005N\u00062\/\u00012\u00052\u00021 \u2212 v2 \b\u00011 \u2212 v2\u0002N\u00062\/\u00052\n\u000f\u000e\n\u22121\nv\nexp\u0005\u2212 N\u00062\/\u00012\u00052\u00021 \u2212 w2 \b\u00011 \u2212 w2\u0002\u22121\u2212N\u00062\/\u00052dwdv .\nThis expression appears complicated, but one can derive its\nasymptotic expansion for large values of N\u00062 \/\u00052 \u0001which im-\nplies large N as \u00062 and \u00052 are approximately constant\u0002 by\nmeans of a Kramers-like approximation \u000315\u0004. It has the\nsimple form T\u0001\u22121 \/\t2\u0002\u0010 \t2\n\u00062 \u0001\n2\n\te \u0002\nN\u00062\/\u00052, which reveals a pure\nexponential growth in the inverse noise intensity N\u00062 \/\u00052 for\nasymptotically large values. Further moments of the switch-\ning time distribution can be calculated from Eq. \u000111\u0002 for n\n\r1. In the limit N\u2192\u000e one finds the relation Tn=n !Tn. This\nrelationship implies, in turn, that the switching process is a\nPoisson process.\nWe can also compute the first passage time for the model\nEq. \u00011\u0002. In this case, we solve the equation \u00061\u0003sgn\u0001u\u0002\n\u2212u\u0004\u0001uT+\n\u00051\nN \u0001uuT=\u22121, subject to the boundary conditions\nT\u00010\u0002=0 and T\u0001\u0001\u2212\u000e\u0002=0, where the latter condition is the ana-\nlog of the previous zero flux condition adapted for an SPD\nwith infinite support. We find\nT\u0001u\u0002 =\t \nN\n2\u00061\u00051\n\u000e\nu\n0\nexp\u0005N\u000612\u00051 \u00011 + v\u00022\b\n\u000f\u00112 \u2212 erfc\u0005\t\u00061N2\u00051 \u00011 + v\u0002\b\u0012dv ,\nwhich also behaves exponentially in N for large values of N\nbut this time with an N dependent prefactor \u0001see Supplemen-\ntary Information of \u00033\u0004\u0002. The relation between these two\nmean switching times \u0003the model Eq. \u00011\u0002 and that of the\nrevised model \u00033\u0004\u0004 is extensively discussed in \u00033\u0004, so we will\nnot reproduce the discussion here.\nNow we compare the theoretical results with the exponen-\ntial fitting we have performed on experimental data from \u00031\u0004\nfor both the first and second moments of the switching time\ndistribution. The data are insufficient for us to reliably obtain\nany moments higher than the second. For the mean switching\ntime T and second moment T2 we found\nT = \u0001970\t 120\u0002exp\u0003\u00010.045\t 0.007\u0002N\u0004s,\n\tT2\/2 = \u00011300\t 190\u0002exp\u0003\u00010.041\t 0.008\u0002N\u0004s.\nAccording to the relation Tn=n !Tn for the moments of the\nexponential distribution, these two values should be the same\nif the switching process were Poissonian. Note that the ex-\nponential growth is the same for both \u0001within errors\u0002, while\nthe prefactor is larger for the second moment. This suggests\nthat the switching process is Poissonian for large N, that is,\nthe probability distribution for the switching events is P\n=T\u22121 exp\u0001\u2212t \/T\u0002. For small values of N the behavior is more\nstochastic, as signaled by the larger prefactor of the second\nmoment \u0001when N is small the prefactor dominates over the\nexponential\u0002. If the switching process is Poissonian then this\nhas a series of consequences concerning predictability: the\nstandard deviation being equal to the mean implies a 100%\nerror in predictions. Furthermore, switching events are un-\ncorrelated and the distribution tail falls off exponentially for\nlong times. This allows for a higher probability of rare events\nthan would be allowed by a Gaussian tail. This also implies\nthat the switching process is Markovian, as predicted by the\nFPE. This can be seen from the double-welled FPE \u00012\u0002 in the\nlarge N limit. After a short time the system relaxes to one\npotential minimum where it stays an exponentially long time\nuntil the switch occurs. Since practically all switches start at\nthe minimum this erases the memory and the Markov prop-\nerty is recovered. The verification of this theoretical predic-\ntion by the experimental data suggests that no important cor-\nrelations have been suppressed in the coarse-grained\ncomputation in \u00033\u0004, and that this method, and the FPE \u00012\u0002,\nare suitable to describe the locust dynamics exhibited by the\nexperimental data.\nV. SECOND MOMENTS\nAnother indicator of the stochastic properties of the sys-\ntem is the second moment, which measures the spread of the\nmean velocity, u, with respect to some reference value. We\nconsider two variants, one centered at the origin S0\nESCUDERO et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 82, 011926 \u00012010\u0002\n011926-4\n\u000f\r\n\u22121\n1 u2Ps\u0001u\u0002du, and one centered at one of the maxima of\nthe probability distribution Sm\u000f\r\n\u22121\n1 \u0001u\u2212umax\u00022Ps\u0001u\u0002du. Of\ncourse, the value of Sm is the same for both maxima as a\nconsequence of the symmetry of the system. These integrals\nhave been computed numerically and are represented in Fig.\n1\u0001c\u0002, centered at the origin, and Fig. 1\u0001d\u0002 centered at a maxi-\nmum. Both show nonmonotonic behavior in noise intensity,\nbut attain their minima for different values of the noise am-\nplitude. This nonmonotonic behavior, as well as the behavior\nof the effective barrier height, are not reflected in the rela-\ntionship between mean switching time and the size of the\nnoise parameter \u0001N\u00062 \/\u00052\u0002: the mean switching time grows\nmonotonically with noise amplitude. For comparison we\nnote that both moments S0 and Sm grow monotonically with\nthe inverse noise intensity in the model given by Eq. \u00011\u0002; in\nthis case they are\nS0 = 1 +\n\u00051\n\u00061N\n+\n\t 2\u00051\n\n\u00061N\nexp\u0006\u2212 \u00061N2\u00051 \u0007\n1 + erf\u0006\t\u00061N2\u00051 \u0007\n,\n\u000112\u0002\nSm = 2 +\n\u00051\n\u00061N\n+\n\t 2\u00051\n\n\u00061N\nexp\u0006\u2212 \u00061N2\u00051 \u0007\n1 + erf\u0006\t\u00061N2\u00051 \u0007\n.\nThere is another feature of the second moments of the re-\nvised model \u00033\u0004, in addition to the nonmonotonic behavior,\nthat reveals new characteristics of the collective motion of\nlocusts not reflected by the model Eq. \u00011\u0002. In this model, a\nreduction in the number of individuals increases the values\nof both second moments. In the stronger noise situation the\nprobability distribution tails grow, which implies that there\nare more individuals with a higher \u0001absolute value\u0002 velocity.\nIn our case the probability is compactly supported in\n\u0003\u22121,1\u0004, as a consequence of the biological fact that the\npropagation cannot be better than perfect. For realistic values\nof the parameters the system is in the weak noise regime \u0003see\nFig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004. This means that the second moment centered at\nthe origin decreases for a decreasing number of locusts, ex-\nactly the opposite trend to that of the model Eq. \u00011\u0002. The\nreason is that the probability of finding the system in the\nneighborhood of u=0 grows considerably for stronger noise\n\u0001as reflected by the decreasing barrier height\u0002, largely com-\npensating for the drift of the maxima toward the boundaries\nof the support of the SPD. The experimentally derived value\nof \u00052 \/N\u00062=0.12\t0.08 for N=20 agrees with the minimiz-\ning value of the second moment centered at a maximum,\n\u00052 \/N\u00062\u00100.12 \u0003see Fig. 1\u0001d\u0002\u0004. This implies that its behavior\nis not very sensitive to small changes in the number of lo-\ncusts.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have seen that the FPE obtained from the coarse-\ngrained analysis of experimental data on the movement of\nlocusts shows an interesting phenomenology. Different indi-\ncators of order and\/or disorder may vary nonmonotonically\nwith noise intensity, possibly in a contradictory manner.\nThese findings reveal that these indicators might not be suit-\nable for the biologically motivated models studied in this\npaper. We have also shown that the direction switches are\nindependently distributed for large numbers of individuals.\nThis makes them almost unpredictable from a practical view-\npoint. It seems that directional switches are produced by an\naccumulation of errors \u0001made by the locusts when trying to\nadapt their velocity to that of their neighbors\u0002 that ordinarily\ninterfere and cancel each other out but, over exponentially\nlong times, have the possibility of accumulating and produc-\ning a switch. According to the results presented here, specifi-\ncally the confirmation of the Poissonian character of the\nswitching events, it seems possible that directional switches\nare produced as a consequence of the ergodic random evolu-\ntion of the system. We note the similarity of this process with\nIsing model ergodic magnetization changes \u000316\u0004. Indeed, the\nmodel of Eq. \u00011\u0002 can be thought of as an Ising model with\nmoving spins. It seems that the ergodic nature of the finite\nsize Ising model is preserved despite introducing movement\nof the spins. More importantly it seems that this is a plau-\nsible explanation, in the absence of external stimuli, of the\nsudden changes of direction observed in animal groups.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to David Sumpter for useful com-\nments and discussions.
