Introduction \nSelf-assembled quantum dots (QDs) [1] are an area of intense interest due to their unusual \nelectrical and optical properties, especially their potential for applications [2]. The vast majority of \nthis research has concentrated on type-I QDs such as InAs\/GaAs, but there is increasing interest in \ntype-II dots. In particular, GaSb\/GaAs QDs [3,4,5], which can confine the holes but not the \nelectrons [6], display novel physical phenomena [7,8] and are of interest for applications in \nmemory devices [9,10], lasers [11,12], and solar cells [13]. For all these applications performance \nis highly dependent on QD density, size, uniformity and composition, so these should be studied as \na prerequisite for the realisation of any device. In turn, several factors affect QD characteristics \nsuch as deposition time of GaSb [14], III-V beam flux ratio [15], growth rate and growth \ntemperature [16]. For example, the capability of QDs to trap carriers is determined by the thermal \nactivation barrier or localisation potential which determines the storage time of a QD memory. \nVery recent research has shown that GaSb\/(Al)GaAs is a very promising material combination for \nsuch applications. Localization energies were calculated using eight-band k.p theory, leading to the \nprediction of an extraordinary 106 years hole storage time for GaSb\/AlAs dots [10]. However, it \nwas also shown that the storage time is highly sensitive to the compositional purity of the dots. \nGaAs0.4Sb0.6\/GaAs QDs have a storage time of ~0.5\u00b5s [10], whereas pure GaSb\/GaAs dots have an \nestimated storage time of 13 minutes [10], which is approximately 1 billion times greater. The \ndilution of the QD Sb content is very likely to occur in the capping process immediately after the \nQD formation. Hence, the capping layer material or growth procedure plays a crucial role in \ndetermining the quality of the device. Although we have not probed the purity of the dots, we do \ndemonstrate that the capping layer growth temperature has a remarkably strong influence on QD \nproperties.  \n\u00a0 3\nOur investigation has two strands. Firstly we have studied the effect of growth temperature \non GaSb QDs formed using the Stranski-Krastanow (SK) mode, covering a wider and lower \ntemperature range compared with the only previous report [16]. We find that the QD morphology \nis a strong function of the growth temperature. We note that a different method based on droplet \nepitaxy has recently been used to grow GaSb QDs, where a Ga droplet was exposed to Sb to \nproduce GaSb QDs. Much lower growth temperatures were used in this alternative technique to \ncontrol the QDs\u2019 characteristics [17]. Secondly, by growing the capping layer at the same \ntemperature as the dots, we can also see the effect of capping the QDs via the photoluminescence \n(PL) spectra. Although the issue of capping and its influence on the QDs\u2019 properties has been \nstudied extensively, this has been largely restricted to the InAs\/GaAs system [18-20]. There are \nonly a few papers on the growth of GaSb QDs [14-17,21-25,32], and the specific issue of capping \nhas not been addressed, even though effects may be more pronounced than in InAs\/GaAs. Indeed, \nour data show that Sb-As exchange during capping is prevalent, and that it leads to dissolution of \nthe dots unless a low capping temperature is used. \n \n2. Experimental details \nA series of undoped samples comprising GaSb QDs embedded in a GaAs matrix were \ngrown on semi-insulating (001) GaAs substrates using a solid-source VG V80H molecular beam \nepitaxy system. The growth temperature was determined by using a calibrated pyrometer. After \noxide desorption of the substrate, a ~500 nm thick GaAs buffer layer was deposited. Then the \ntemperature of the GaAs substrate was reduced under As2 flux for GaSb deposition. Four samples \nA, B, C, and D were grown at temperatures T, of 400\u00b0C, 430\u00b0C, 460\u00b0C and 490\u00b0C, respectively. \nThe growth rate was fixed at 0.3 monolayer (ML) s-1 with 7 s deposition time, producing \nnominally 2.1 ML of GaSb with a III\/V ratio of 2 to produce GaSb QDs using the SK mode. The \n\u00a0 4\nGaAs growth rate was determined based on reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) \noscillations during deposition of the GaAs buffer layer. The calibration procedure was repeated for \neach sample prior to the growth of the GaSb layer. \nGrowth of an undoped GaAs capping layer was preceded by exposing the GaSb surface to \nSb for 8 s. The dots were then covered by a 5\u00b12 nm GaAs layer at the same growth temperature \nand growth rate as for the GaSb deposition, before the substrate temperature was raised to 580oC \nwithin 180 s under As flux. A further GaAs layer with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited for 360 \ns with the growth rate at 1 ML s-1. Finally, a second layer of GaSb was deposited under the same \ngrowth conditions as the first GaSb layer for morphological studies of surface QDs.  \nAtomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the surface topography. A Digital \nInstruments Multimode Scanning Probe Microscope was used to study the surface of QD samples \nto obtain information about their size and density. AFM was run in tapping mode in air with the \nresonance frequency ~300 kHz and a setpoint which varied for each sample. We used a high \nquality silicon tip to better follow the contours of sample\u2019s surface. The optical properties were \nstudied with PL measurements at 4.2 K by immersing the samples in liquid helium. The 532 nm \nline of a Nd:YVO4 laser was used to excite the samples optically and a spectrometer fitted with an \nInGaAs detector was used to wavelength-resolve the collected emission. The laser light was \ntransmitted to the sample with an optical fibre giving a spot size of diameter ~2 mm with a power \ndensity of ~7 W\/cm2. \n \n3. Results and discussion \nThe AFM profiles of the samples surfaces reveal the density, size and height of the \nuncapped QDs. In Figure 1 (a)-(d) we show a series of 1-\u00b5m2-sized AFM images that illustrate the \ndifferent surface morphologies of GaSb QDs at growth temperature of (a) 400\u00b0C, (b) 430\u00b0C, (c) \n\u00a0 5\n460\u00b0C and (d) 490\u00b0C. The size and density of QDs on the samples surfaces are summarized in \nTable 1. At 400\u00b0C, the majority of the QDs are rather flat, elongated and rectangular in shape, and \nnon-uniform in size. The average width and height of the dots are 42 nm and 3.4 nm respectively. \nIt is possible that these flat rectangular dots are interface misfit (IMF) [4] dots and not SK dots, \nwhich are typically more rounded. However, some smaller and more rounded QDs with 1.7 nm \nheight and 27 nm diameter remain after the growth temperature was increased and can be found on \neach of the samples. By increasing the growth temperature further, the elongated dots are \ntransformed to nearly round dots. For the sample grown at 430\u00b0C (sample B), the average QD size \nis significantly reduced to 2.4 nm in height and 25 nm in diameter. There is a corresponding rise in \nthe density from 2.7\u00d7109 cm-2 to 4.2\u00d71010 cm-2, the QD shape is more semi-spherical, indicating \nthe onset of SK growth mode, but the size distribution remains broad. At a growth temperature of \n460\u00b0C, the QD size distribution is narrower and the shapes are improved, resulting in more \nrounded QDs. The average diameter of the dots is 35 nm and the height is 3.1 nm with a decrease \nin density to 3.4\u00d71010 cm-2 which is due to coalescence of the dots [15]. Finally, at the highest \ngrowth temperature of 490\u00b0C, the coalescence of the dots has decreased the density to 1.8\u00d7109 cm-\n2. The diameter is essentially unchanged at 36 nm, whilst the height has increased to 6.4 nm \nimplying that a large volume of Sb has been lost. Previous investigations of Sb condensation on \nGaSb using in situ surface X-ray diffraction found that the process involves diffusion and \ncoarsening which changes the size of the dots [24].  However, it should be noted that there is \nstrong evidence that the surface dots may be quite different from the buried dots, as is now \ngenerally believed. Firstly, gradually cooling the sample after the end of the growth effectively \nresults in the inclusion of a growth interruption which is absent for the capped dots in the sample, \nand may change their morphology [25], perhaps even the dot density. In addition the capping itself \ncan change the dot substantially [26-31], as we now go on to discuss. \n\u00a0 6\nSeveral papers have reported the effect of As2 and As4 on the growth of As\/Sb \nheterostructures. They found that anion exchange was more active using As2 [32-34] compared \nwith As4 [34]. Nosho et al. [34] concluded that by using As4 the anion exchange can be reduced in \nGaSb layer, leading to better film stability. Hence, it is likely that the probability of producing high \nquality and pure GaSb QDs in a GaAs matrix are lower in our case, since As2 is expected to \nincrease the exchange of group V elements at the interface. An unsuitably high capping-layer \ntemperature is another factor that may destroy the buried dots. Several groups have investigated \nthe effect of the capping layer using different materials [29,30]. Segregation [27,31] and\/or anion \nexchange may change the size, shape and the density of the buried dots during the growth.  \nFigure 2 shows the PL spectra from the four samples A to D. Sample A, which was grown \nat the lowest temperature, exhibits bright PL with the QD peak well separated from the wetting \nlayer (WL) PL. The observation of QD PL from this sample does not exclude the possibility that \nthe rectangular dots in this sample are IMF QDs [4]. In contrast, for samples B and C which have \nthe highest surface dot areal density, it can be seen that the QD peak is hardly discernable or even \nabsent, merging with the WL PL. In sample D, the QD peak is very weak compared to the intense \nWL peak, but nevertheless it can be clearly distinguished.  \nAFM shows that the surface morphologies of dots for samples A (T=400\u02daC) and D \n(T=490\u02daC) have a low density with a large lateral size, and are higher for sample D, whereas \nsamples B and C have a large density of smaller dots. The PL data indicates that the large QDs \nwith low density seem to survive the capping better than the high-density\/small QDs. This is \nillustrated by the schematics in Figure 2.  \nAt growth temperatures <490\u02daC, the heights of the dots are small and therefore they are \nprone to dissolution during capping. Samples B (T =430\u02daC) and C (T =460\u02daC) have a high density \nof small dots with a height that is similar to sample A, but due to the low capping temperature the \n\u00a0 7\ndots in sample A can survive, as demonstrated by the bright PL emission. The \nintermixing\/segregation of Sb from the GaSb layer during deposition of the capping layer has been \ndemonstrated by Timm et al. [28] and Ulloa et al. [30] using cross-sectional scanning tunneling \nmicroscopy. The stronger bonding energy between As-Ga compared to Sb-Ga increases the anion \nexchange resulting in the shrinkage of the QDs [10]. The capping layer may change the QD \nvolume, as was recently demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy of a GaSb\/GaAs \nstructure [31]. Segregation of Sb from the dot layer causes a reduction of volume of capped dots \nand the Sb becomes incorporated into GaAs layer resulting in a GaAsSb alloy, the Sb may even be \nevaporated from the sample surface at high growth temperature. For sample D, a weak but well-\nresolved QD PL peak is observed, implying that the largest dots can endure the high temperature \ncapping.  \nIn order to confirm this explanation, two further samples were grown. For the first of these \n(sample E), the dots were thinly capped with ~10 nm of GaAs at a nominal temperature of 490\u00b0C \nwhile for the second (sample F), which had the same sample structure as samples A to D, the dots \nwere initially capped at 430\u00b0C. AFM data for sample E is shown in Figure 1 (e) with a scan area of \n10\u00d710 \u00b5m2, i.e. 100 times larger than the other images in the figure. The surface shows micron-\nsize elongated features, strongly indicative of melting of the QDs by the thin GaAs capping layer \ndue to its high growth temperature. This is consistent with the rapid disappearance of the spotty \nRHEED pattern during the capping of this sample. However, the exact composition of the capping \nlayer is unknown.  \nIn contrast, the spotty RHEED pattern survived substantially longer during the capping of \nsample F. Figure 1 (f) shows the AFM image of this sample. The uncapped surface dots have a \nrelatively high dot density of 2.8\u00d71010 cm-2, with 2.6 nm in height and 42 nm in diameter. Despite \nthe difference in QD density on the sample surface for samples D and F, both PL spectra have \n\u00a0 8\napproximately similar value of QD peak energy. The difference in surface QD density between \nsamples D and F illustrates that the QD morphology is highly sensitive to the growth temperature. \nHowever, the point to be stressed here is the importance of the temperature of the capping layer.  \nIn marked contrast to samples B to D, sample F shows very strong QD PL (Figure 3) with high \nintensity, well separated from WL peak; clear proof that capping at low temperature is needed to \npreserve the dots.  \n \n4. Conclusions \nWe have conducted atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence experiments on six \nGaSb\/GaAs QDs samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Atomic force microscopy data show \nthat the quantum dot morphology is highly sensitive to growth temperature in the 400 to 490\u00b0C \nrange. At 400\u00b0C the dots are large and rectangular with low density and poor uniformity. As the \ngrowth temperature is raised there is an increasing tendency towards a more uniform distribution \nof rounded dots, with improved diffusivity leading to increasing QD size (volume) and decreasing \ndensity. In contrast, photoluminescence measurements on the same samples show that strong \nexchange\/intermixing effects during capping make the dots highly prone to dissolution unless the \ncapping temperature is low. This was further demonstrated by atomic force microscopy images of \na sample that was thinly capped at 490\u00b0C, and by the substantially improved photoluminescence \nspectrum of a sample for which the dots were grown at high temperature and capped at low \ntemperature.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \n[grant number EP\/H006419], in the framework of the QD2D project; the Royal Society-Brian \n\u00a0 9\nMercer Feasibility Award; and the Belgian IAP.
