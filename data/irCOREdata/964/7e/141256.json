Immunoassays are rapid, sensitive and selective for the analyte of interest and \nare generally cost effective for large sample loads. However, as with any technology \nthere are disadvantages, for example, the reagent stability and the high expense of \nproducing antibodies are often cited as problems. In addition, the production of \nantibodies for toxins and immunodepressants is particularly difficult due to their \nadverse action on the metabolism and the immune system.  \nIn this regard molecularly imprinted polymers have already been identified as \nstable artificial mimics, suitable for the substitution of receptors and antibodies in \nassays or sensors (Vlatakis et al., 1993; Piletsky et al., 1998; Mirsky et al., 1999, \nSurugiu et al., 1999). Their most significant advantages are inherent stability, low cost \nand ease of preparation (Kriz et al., 1994; Wulff, 1995). However, MIPs have \nshortcomings, such as lack of true water compatibility as well as difficult \nimmobilization procedures. In particular, the absence of a reproducible method of \ncoating microplate wells with MIPs impairs their application in assays where this format \nis preferable. Here we present a new method of microplate modification with imprinted \npolymers based on aniline and thiophene derivatives. Low-molecular weight organic \nsubstances, such as epinephrine and atrazine, and proteins with different molecular \nweight such as microperoxidase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and lactoperoxidase \nwere selected as templates for these experiments. The fundamental significance of this \n 3\napproach lies in the development of a new method for synthesis of artificial receptors \nusing molecular imprinting in conjugated polymers. Besides the theoretical interest, this \nwork has practical significance for the development of assays for environmental \nmonitoring and the pharmaceutical industry (drug discovery). \n \nEXPERIMENTAL SECTION \nMaterials \n \nAmmonium persulfate, cytochrome C from horse heart muscle and glutaric dialdehyde \nwere purchased from Aldrich (Dorset, UK). Microperoxidase was purchased from \nBiozyme laboratories (Blaenavon, UK). Lactoperoxidase from bovine milk was from \nFluka (Buchs, Switzerland). 2,2\u2019-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid \n(ABTS), horseradish peroxidase from horseradish roots, Tween-20 and acetic acid were \npurchased from Sigma (Dorset, UK). Polystyrene microplates were from Corning, \n(Corning, NY). All other chemicals and solvents (HPLC grade) were obtained from \ncommercial sources and used as received. \nGrafting of the polymers to the microplate surface. Monomers were polymerized on \nthe microplate walls using the following procedure: 50 \u00b5l solution of aniline \nhydrochloride (720 mM) in water was placed in microplate wells using a multichannel \npipette and mixed at 22 0C with a 50 \u00b5l solution of (NH4)2S2O8 (250 mM). 3-\nAminophenylboronic acid was polymerized by mixing together a 50 \u00b5l solution of 3-\naminophenyl boronic acid (100 mM) with a 50 \u00b5l solution of (NH4)2S2O8 (50 mM). 3-\nThiopheneboronic acid was polymerized by using 50 \u00b5l K2Cr2O7 (200 mM) instead of \nammonium persulfate as oxidizer. Polymerization of the imprinted polymers was \nperformed in anoxygen atmosphere in the presence of template (1 mg\/ml concentration). \n 4\nThe reaction was carried out with gentle stirring for 20-60 min. After polymerization the \nmicroplates were washed 3 times with deionized water, 5 times with 10 mM HCl and \nthen with water again. The efficiency of the washing procedure for imprinted enzymes \nwas evaluated by measuring the residual enzymatic activity. ABTS (6 mg) solution was \ndissolved in 10 ml Na-citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.0) and mixed with 3 \u00b5l of 30 wt. % \nH2O2. An aliquot of 100 \u00b5l of the solution was added to a microplate well containing \nsample of the membrane and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The optical \ndensity of the solution was measured at 450 nm using a MR700 Microplate Reader \n(Dinex Technologies Inc., Edgewood, NY). The measurements indicated that 7-10% of \nthe enzyme remained trapped in the polymer. \nConjugate preparation. Horseradish peroxidase (4 mg) (EC1.11.1.7 from horseradish \nroots, MW 44 000 Da, Sigma) was dissolved in 1 ml norepinephrine or desethylatrazine \nsolution in water (1 mM). An aliquot (5 \u00b5l) of glutaric dialdehyde solution in water (10 \nwt. %) was added to the mixture and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The \nreaction was stopped by addition of 200 \u00b5l lysine solution (50 mg\/ml). The solution was \nfiltered through a macrofilter (Ultra-Spin Macrofilter, Roth, Germany) to separate \nmolecules with molecular weight > 10 kDa, and washed with buffer. The activity of the \nconjugated enzyme was found to be 400-450 units per mg solid (determined using \nH2O2\/ABTS).  \nEnzyme-linked assay. Binding of the \u03b2-receptor agonists to the microplates coated \nwith either MIP or blank polymers, was measured using a competitive reaction between \nHRP-N conjugate (HRP-A in the case of atrazine assay) and free analyte. A 50 \u00b5l \naliquot of corresponding analytes (0-1 mM concentrations) and 50 \u00b5l HRP-N or HRP-A \nconjugate (625 ng\/ml) were mixed in the microplate wells and incubated for 1 hour at \n 5\nroom temperature. The microplates were then washed three times with 0.005 wt. % \nTween-20 and Na-phosphate buffer (25 mM pH 7.5). The reaction of HRP with \nhydrogen peroxide and ABTS was used to measure the conjugate adsorbed on the \npolymer. Six milligrams of ABTS solution was dissolved in 10 ml Na-citrate buffer (0.1 \nM, pH 6.0) and mixed with 3 \u00b5l 30 wt. % H2O2. An aliquot (100 \u00b5l) of this solution was \nadded to each well and incubated for 35 min at 22 0C. Optical absorbance was measured \nat 450 nm using a microplate reader. The dissociation constants were determined using \nthe Scatchard analysis. The apparent KD values were calculated from the equation KD = \nEC50\/(1 + [conjugate]\/KD conjugate). The KD conjugate value was determined by \nmeasuring the sorption by the polymer of horseradish peroxidase conjugate with \nnorepinephrine, using seven concentrations of conjugate ranging from 10 to 750 ng\/ml \n(KD conjugate = 41.4 nM). All measurements were made in triplicate. \nFluorescent assay. Atrazine binding was measured using a competitive reaction \nbetween fluorescent triazine derivative 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazinyl)aminofluorescein (FT) \nconjugate (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) and free analyte. A 50 \u00b5l \naliquot of corresponding analytes (0-1 mM concentrations) and 50 \u00b5l FT conjugate (5 \nng\/ml) were mixed in the microplate wells and incubated for 1 hour at room \ntemperature. After incubation for 4 hours at room temperature, the fluorescence of \nanalyte was measured using a fluorimeter, Fluoro Max-2 (Instruments SA, UK), at a \nwavelength of 512 nm (excitation= 490 nm) in order to estimate the quantity of \ndisplaced conjugate.  \nAnalysis of the enzyme binding to the polymer. Protein solutions with concentrations \nof 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3 and 0.1 \u00b5g\/ml were prepared in 50 mM sodium-phosphate \nbuffer, pH 7.0 containing 0.1% Tween-20 and added in 100 \u00b5l aliquots to the microplate \n 6\nwells. After 90 min incubation, the plates were washed with the same buffer to remove \nthe non-adsorbed protein and the quantity of bound protein was measured by \ndetermination of its peroxidase activity using ABTS as substrate. ABTS solution (6 mg) \nwas dissolved in 10 ml Na-citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.0) and mixed with 3 \u00b5l of 30 wt. \n% H2O2. Solution (100 \u00b5l) was added to microplate well containing membrane sample \nand incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The optical density of the solution was \nthen measured at 450 nm using a MR700 Microplate Reader (Dinex Technologies Inc., \nEdgewood, NY). All the measurements were made in triplicate. The data obtained were \nplotted in a Scatchard plot and dissociation constants were calculated. \nPolymer visualization. The bottom of the microplate wells coated with the polymer \nsamples were cut from the microplate and fixed on a silicon support. Atomic Force \nMicroscope (AFM) images were obtained using the Quesant Resolver model (Quesant \nInstrument Corporation, Hills, CA). Samples were scanned in wave-mode, at a scan rate \nof 2 Hz and 400 pixel resolution.  \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nThe possibility of coating microplates with MIP was demonstrated for different \ntemplates: epinephrine, atrazine, and proteins. Two of them are small organic molecules \nand the others are relatively large molecules with molecular weight ranging from 1.1 \nkDa (microperoxidase) to 77 kDa (lactoperoxidase). We chose these substances as \ntemplate because they provide a convenient example to demonstrate the possibilities of \nthe method and its performance. Not only did the size of molecule vary in our \nexperiments, but also the type of monomer-template interaction.  \n 7\nFormation of a stable complex between functional monomers and the template is \ncrucial for the development of specific molecularly imprinted polymers. Epinephrine \nhas several functional groups, which are binding points for the interaction with the \nfunctional monomer: a diol group in the aromatic ring, hydroxyl group and a secondary \namino group (Figure 1). This structure predetermined the choice of the functional \nmonomer, which in our case was 3-aminophenylboronic acid (APBA). Depending on \nsolvent polarity and pH, poly-3-aminophenylboronic acid is able to form reversible \ncovalent bonds between boronic acid and catechol, and electrostatic interactions \nbetween boronic acid and the secondary amino and hydroxyl groups in the template.  \nAtrazine is poorly soluble in water (\u224810-4 M). Additionally it only has secondary \namino groups able to interact with the polymer. This makes it necessary to perform the \npolymerization in a mixed water-organic solvent environment using functional \nmonomers containing, preferably, acidic functionalities (Table 1).  \nProtein imprinting has been done before (Liao et al., 1996) using acrylamide as \na functional monomer. It was postulated that specificity in the case of a large template \ncan be more efficiently realized through weak multipoint interactions rather than \nexploring a few strong ones. Because of this, we chose aniline and APBA for protein \nimprinting. \nThe MIP deposition on the microplate well surface was performed by a chemical \noxidation initiated by ammonium persulfate (Pringsheim et al., 1997). In the case of \nthiophene derivatives we used a stronger oxidant \u2013 potassium dichromate. The ability of \nthe monomers to form a thin polymer coating on the microplate well surface was \nevaluated (Table 1). The best coatings (taking into account stability of the polymer films \nand reproducibility of the coating) were obtained with aniline, APBA and 3-\n 8\nthiopheneboronic acid (TBA). As a result, all the following experiments were \nperformed only with these monomers.  \nDepending on the monomer composition, the polymerization process lasted from \n20 min (aniline derivatives) to 1 h (thiophene derivatives). The topography of the \npolymer coatings was visualized using AFM (Figure 2). Both types of polymers, MIP \nand blank gave almost identical images indicating little physical effect of the imprinting \non the surface morphology. The size of the template also had no effect on the polymer \ntopography. Hence, only images of MIP samples are presented here. Grafted polymers \nproduced relatively smooth and reproducible surface coatings with an average \nroughness of about 40-100 nm. The roughness of polymers made from thiophene \nderivatives was, in general, higher than those made from polyanilines, although poly-\nTBA and PANI images are very similar. All polymer coatings were transparent, \nhomogeneous and suitable for optical measurements. The deviation in the optical \ndensity of the polymer between the wells of the microplate was less than 5 %.  \nThe washing procedure is very important for assay development and it was \nanalyzed in experiments where buffers with different pHs (in presence and absence of \ndetergents) and different times of the treatment were applied. Since the oxidation \npolymerization partially degrades the template and thus makes a correct analysis of the \nresidual quantity of the template in polymer impossible, the washing conditions were \noptimized for each template separately analyzing the affinity of polymers after each \nwashing step (Figure 3). As was shown before (Kriz et al., 1995; Gross et al., 1997) \nPANI grafted to the inert surface possess sufficient porosity permitting mobility of the \nsolvent and analyte inside of the polymer matrix. In general, 80-90% of the template \nwas removed from the polymer (judging from the residual activity of the imprinted \n 9\nenzymes). The capacity of specific binding sites, measured under saturation conditions \ngave a value: 2-15 \u00b5mol\/m2 of the modified surface which depends on the size of \ntemplate. Actually, the presence of small residual amounts of template in the polymer \nwas essential for successful recognition. This can be seen clearly from the presence of \nthe minimum on the curve illustrating the influence of the washing procedure on the \nEC50 value (Figure 3). The nature of this phenomenon will be discussed elsewhere. \nAs previously reported (Piletsky, et al., 2000) microplates coating with the \nepinephrine-imprinted polymer can be used successfully in an enzyme-linked assay \nusing competition between free ligand and HRP-N conjugate. The result, presented in \nFigure 4, clearly indicates high specificity of the imprinted polymer for epinephrine. \nLigands with only slight structural differences from epinephrine had much weaker \nbinding to the MIP than the template. The dissociation constant for epinephrine\/blank \npolymer KD=150 \u00b1 15 \u00b5M and for epinephrine\/MIP KD=9.2 \u00b1 2 \u00b5M, which is similar to \nnatural receptors (Mukherjee et al., 1975). The difference in epinephrine binding to the \nMIP and blank polymer clearly indicates the role of the imprinting process in the \nformation of specific binding sites.  \n Atrazine imprinting was performed using ethanol\/water solution (1:1, v\/v), in \nwhich the template is more soluble. Several monomers based on aniline and thiophene \nderivatives were tested for their ability to form an atrazine-specific MIP (Table 1). The \nnegative charge of the enzyme created a problem for the binding of horseradish \nperoxidase-atrazine conjugate (HRP-A) to negatively charged polymers. This resulted in \nvery little binding of the conjugate to the polymer. To improve the assay performance, \nbinding experiments were performed using a competition reaction between a \ncommercially available fluorescent analogue of atrazine (FT) and free atrazine for \n 10\nbinding to the polymer. In all cases only thiophene derivatives formed MIPs with \nnoticeable affinity towards atrazine. Nitrogen containing anilines were most probably \ncompeting with atrazine for binding to acidic groups.  \nIn our experiments, sorption of FT and atrazine to the polymer was performed \nfor 5 hours, resulting in 70% of the maximum sorption being achieved. The detection \nlimit for atrazine was 8 \u00b5M. Better results were obtained when an atrazine-imprinted \ncomposite polymer was prepared from 3-thiopheneboronic and 3-aminophenylboronic \nacid  (TBA\/APBA) (Figure 5). The resulting composite was more specific and more \nsensitive, giving a detection limit 0.7 \u00b5M. An important indication of the imprinting \nprocess is the almost complete absence of competition between atrazine and fluorescein \ntriazine for binding to the blank polymer. Practically no influence of metribuzin, and \nonly a slight effect of atraton-D was observed on the FT sorption (Figure 5). Probably \nthe heteropolymer has a better ability than the homopolymer to form and maintain \nhighly specific binding sites. The optimal ratio between concentrations of TBA and \nAPBA was found to be 10:1.  \n The possibility to imprint polyaniline and poly-APBA with large protein \nmolecules was studied. Due to strong positive charges, the polyaniline coating has too \nstrong affinity for negatively charged protein molecules and it was difficult to \ndiscriminate between specific and non-specific binding. Better results were obtained \nwhen poly-APBA was used as a matrix. Poly-APBA possesses an equal number of \npositive and negative residues, instead of a prevalence of protonated or deprotonated \ngroups, thus better complementary matching with the template could be envisaged. \nMIPs prepared with lactoperoxidase, HRP, Cytochrome C and microperoxidase were \nchecked for their ability to re-bind templates at pH 7, and the results are displayed in \n 11\nTable 2. From the re-binding experiments it was evident that the size (shape) of the \nmolecule and its charge affects the imprinting efficiency. For a small protein such as \nmicroperoxidase, the dissociation constant was rather high: Kd = 150 \u00b5M. Large \nproteins, such as lactoperoxidase and horseradish peroxidase, possess much lower Kd, \nin the range 1-4 \u00b5M. Charge influence also affects significantly the formation of \nbinding sites and the polymer affinity. Thus, highly positively charged proteins such as \nCytochrome C (pI 10.6) are not able to form imprints in the APBA polymer due to its \nlow affinity to the polymer, which has a net positive charge.  \n In all cases the shelf-life stability of the MIP coated microplates was very good. \nAfter two months a very small decrease in polymer affinity was observed (10-20%). It \nwas assumed that the structure of the specific binding sites in the MIP is preserved \nbecause of two factors: partial cross-linking of the polymers during polymerization and \nfixation of the polymer chains to the microplate well surface. More detailed analysis of \nthe role of these factors in MIP specificity is currently under investigation. \n Summarizing, the feasibility of developing a microplate coating with a polymer \nwhich is specific for small organic molecules, such as epinephrine and atrazine, and for \nlarge protein molecules was demonstrated. The polymer coatings are stable and \nreproducible. These polymers can be used successfully as antibody and receptor \nsubstitutes in assays, High Throughput Screening and drug discovery. \n \n 12\nREFERENCES \nBachand, G. D., Castello, J. D. (1998).
