This architectural com-\nplexity is made further intricate by the presence of blood\nvessels, nerves, neuroendocrine cells, and aggregated gly-\ncoprotein deposits. With the urethra as the key anatomical\nreference point, the prostate is also conventionally divided\ninto three tightly fused zones, or regions, known as the\nperipheral zone (PZ), the transition zone (TZ), and the cen-\ntral zone (CZ) (2). The clinical significance of this complex\nmorphology is that the multifocal entity of prostate adeno-\ncarcinoma (CaP) arises mostly in the PZ, whereas benign\nprostatic hypertrophy (BPH), a nonmalignant overgrowth,\nappears to arise exclusively from the TZ (1). Identification of\na \u2018\u2018susceptibility-to-adenocarcinoma spectral signature\u2019\u2019 based\non biochemical cell structural characteristics could facilitate the\nidentification of premalignant cells (3).\nCaP is the most common malignancy in men and the\nsecond-leading cause of male cancer-related death in devel-\noped countries (4,5). Its progression is a multistage process\nfrom latent carcinoma(s) of low histological grade to high-\ngrade metastatic disease (6). In developed countries, the\nlifetime risk of developing CaP is ;1 in 6 (7). Incidence\nincreases proportionally with age, and among 80-year-old\nmen, ;80% have CaP foci (8). Risk factors may include\nrace, androgen levels, genetic predisposition, and\/or diet (9).\nStudies of migrant populations from low-risk to high-risk re-\ngions point to an association with Western-related lifestyles\n(10). CaP accounts for 15.3% of all cancers occurring in men\nin developed countries and 4.3% in developing countries (6,11).\nHowever, to date the only factor known to be associated with\nCaP is increasing age (12).\nFourier-transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy may\ndiscriminate between disease-free cells and those of patho-\nlogical regions, e.g., cancerous (13).

Conventional\nFTIR spectrometers are equipped with a globar source that\nis a relatively dim thermal infrared (IR) source compared to\na synchrotron IR source (18). In IR microscopy, the beam\nwidth must be limited and if an aperture of, say, 5 mm 3\n5 mm is employed, in an attempt to achieve high spatial\nresolution, the signal\/noise (S\/N) ratio is seriously degraded.\nSynchrotron IR sources generate a highly collimated beam of\nphotons that is of higher brilliance and may be delivered\nthrough a very small sampling aperture to improve the spatial\nresolution up to the point at which it becomes diffraction\nlimited. This allows for the acquisition of spectra at a spatial\nresolution of 5 mm and S\/N ratio ;1000 times greater than\nconventional FTIR microspectroscopy (18,19). Attenuated\ntotal reflection-FTIR (ATR) spectroscopy is another method\nthat is particularly suited for the IR interrogation of membrane-\nassociated peptides and proteins (16).\nLarge numbers of variables, as found in some spectroscopic\nstudies, make it difficult to identify the significant underlying\nvariance (14,19). The intrinsic dimensionality of such data\nmay be interrogated using principal component analysis\n(PCA). In PCA, each spectrum becomes a single point, or\nscore, in n-dimensional space and using selected principal\ncomponents (PCs) as coordinates, the data may be analyzed\nfor clustering when viewed in a particular direction. The PCs\nare eigenvectors of the correlation coefficient matrix of\nsquared deviations. They comprise a new set of variables,\nretaining almost all the variation present in all of the original\nspectral variables, with the first PC presenting the most\nvariance, thesecondPC(orthogonal toPC1)presenting themax-\nimum amount of the remaining variance, etc. (20).\nOnce the clusters have been identified, one needs to define\nthose regions of the spectra that exhibit biomolecular and\/or\nconformational changes. Accordingly, PCA also estimates the\ncontribution of each wavenumber (loadings or weight) to each\nPC. PCA then allows a loadings curve, or pseudospectrum, to\nbe plotted for each PC, in effect giving the variance at each\nwavenumber in the spectrum. A possible weakness of this\napproach is that unless one of the PCs happens to pass through\nthe cluster in question, the vital wavenumbers responsible for\nthe observed clustering might be missed. The identification of\na given cluster involves more than one PC and we show that a\nsingle \u2018\u2018cluster vector\u2019\u2019 may be plotted, passing through the\nmedian of the cluster of interest. A weighted averaging\nalgorithm then gives a single loadings curve.\nIn this study, we employed ATR spectroscopy and syn-\nchrotron radiation-based FTIR microspectroscopy to exam-\nine the CaP-free spectral signature of PZ and TZ glandular\nepithelial cells in comparison with those in histologically\ndesignated CaP regions. The stromal matrices in which such\ncell types are held were also interrogated. The rationale of\nthis approach was to determine whether spectrally desig-\nnated structural characteristics could be identified that might\npoint to a region-specific susceptibility to adenocarcinoma\nwithin the prostate. If a susceptibility-to-adenocarcinoma spec-\ntral signature could be identified using IR spectroscopy, such\nan approach could facilitate the monitoring and identification\nof premalignant cells before progression to invasive CaP.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy participants\nInformed consent to obtain prostate tissue sets for research was obtained\n(LREC no. 2003.6.v; Preston, Chorley, and South Ribble Ethical Commit-\ntee). Patients (n \u00bc 6; Table 1) undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy\n(RRP) for CaP on the basis of low PSA (,20 mg\/l serum) and low-disease\nvolume (less than two core CaP-positive biopsies per eight taken) were\nselected (3). In addition, after a radical cystoprostatectomy for removal of\nmuscle-invasive bladder carcinoma, a seventh CaP-free tissue set was\nobtained (Table 1). The donor patient cohort was coded PEC1\u2013PEC7 with\nPEC1\u2013PEC6 being samples obtained from RRP patients; PEC7 was the\nseventh tissue. From each donor patient, a tissue set consisting of separate\nslices of CaP-free PZ, CaP-free TZ, and CaP was obtained.\nProstate tissue sets\nTo this end, a CaP-free prostate tissue mass separate to the area of CaP, that\nwould be present in the gland, was isolated postsurgery. Tissue slices repres-\nenting the PZ or TZ tissue were dissected out from these tissue masses.\nIndependently of this procedure, a slice containing CaP and isolated from a\ndifferent part of the prostate gland (i.e., separate to the aforementioned tissue\nmass) was also retrieved. Subsequently, a microtomed 10-mm-thick section\nof each tissue slice was prepared for analysis by IR spectroscopy.\nAfter each individual RRP, a CaP-free prostate tissue mass was selected\nfrom the lobe from which preoperative biopsy cores were negative. This\nprostate tissue mass was sliced from the upper part of the gland just above\nthe area of the verumontanum. To obtain PZ tissue, a slice ;2 cm in length\nand 0.3 cm in width was isolated from the most peripheral and posterolateral\naspect of the gland. A further tissue slice, ;1.5 cm in length and 0.3 cm in\nwidth, was then isolated from the area identified immediately lateral to the\nurethra (periurethral); this was designated TZ. These tissue slices were\nimmediately formalin fixed, after which they were paraffin embedded. Also\nafter RRP, a representative paraffin-embedded slice containing CaP was\nobtained through the hospital pathology archive in which all such tissues are\nstored indefinitely. Microtomed sections (4-mm thick) of all these paraffin-\nembedded tissue slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to\nbe checked retrospectively by a pathologist to confirm the absence of CaP or\nTABLE 1 Details of study participants and tissue\nsamples examined\nPatient\nno.\nAge\n(year)\nPSA\n(mg\/l) DRE\nSmoking\nstatus Alcohol Diet\nGleason\ngrade\nPEC1 62 9.0 Benign Yes Yes NV 413\nPEC2 59 4.4 Benign Yes Yes NV 314\nPEC3 60 5.4 Benign Yes Yes NV 313\nPEC4 68 4.4 Benign No Yes NV 314\nPEC5 65 8.0 T2 right lobe Yes No NV 413\nPEC6 58 4.6 Benign No Yes NV 313\nPEC7* 68 0.5 Benign Yes No NV NA\n*Cystoprostatectomy sample.\nPatients who donated prostate tissue sets for the purposes of this study were\nchronologically numbered PEC1\u2013PEC7.

After radical cystoprostatectomy,\nsmall tissue slices of designated PZ or TZ were isolated as before prior to\nimmediate snap freezing in liquid N2 and storage at \u000385\u0003C. An adjacent\nsmall tissue slice was formalin fixed for subsequent histological examina-\ntion, i.e., paraffin embedding and subsequent staining with H&E.\nTissue preparation for spectroscopy\nFrom RRP patients (PEC1\u2013PEC6), tissue sets consisting of paraffin-\nembedded PZ, TZ, and CaP tissue slices were obtained. Cut from these\ntissue slices, microtomed 10-mm-thick sections of tissue were floated onto\neither 1 cm 3 1 cm Low-E reflective glass microscope slides (for ATR\nspectroscopy) or 0.5-mm-thick BaF2 windows (Photox Optical Systems,\nSheffield, UK) (for transmission-mode synchrotron FTIR microspectro-\nscopy). Sections themselves embedded in wax would contain no water, but\nthe surface water between the section and the glass slides or BaF2 windows\nwas dried off overnight at 37\u0003C. The sections were then dewaxed by\nimmersion in xylene (5 min) and then washed in absolute alcohol (74OP) (5\nmin, i.e., to remove the xylene). In clearly labeled petri dishes, the sections\nwere then placed under vacuum overnight to facilitate removal of\natmospheric water, after which they were stored in a dessicator until\nanalysis. Cryosections (10-mm thick) of snap-frozen samples (PEC7) were\nplaced on 0.5-mm-thick BaF2 windows, placed under vacuum overnight,\nand then in a dessicator until analysis with synchrotron FTIR micro-\nspectroscopy.\nATR spectroscopy\nSpectra were acquired using a Bruker Vector 22 FTIR spectrometer with\nHelios ATR attachment that contained a diamond crystal (Bruker Optics,\nBillerica, MA). Using a closed circuit television camera attached to the ATR\ncrystal, tissue architecture was examined to identify specific regions for\nanalysis. Data were collected in ATR mode and spectra (8 cm\u00031 spectral\nresolution, coadded for 32 scans) were converted into absorbance using\nBruker OPUS software. Spectra were acquired from glandular elements or\nsurrounding stroma. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma Chemical, Poole,\nDorset, UK) was used to clean the ATR crystal after every five spectral\nacquisitions, before transfer of analysis of glandular elements to stroma or\nbefore the first spectral analysis of a particular sample. Each time the crystal\nwas cleaned a new background reading was also taken before recommencing\nspectral analysis. Spectra were baseline corrected using OPUS software and\nnormalized to the amide II (\u00021533 cm\u00031) absorbance band.\nSynchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy\nSpectra were acquired at Daresbury (Warrington, UK) synchrotron source\non beamline 11.1 using the Thermo Nicolet continuum microscope and\nNexus FTIR spectrometer. Spectral collection was in transmission mode, and\nspectra were converted to absorbance using Thermo Omnic software\n(Waltham, MA). A 323 Reflachromat objective was used, and the aperture\narea was 10 mm 3 10 mm. Spectra were collected at 4 cm\u00031 spectral\nresolution and coadded for 1024 scans.\nIn CaP-free tissues (PZ or TZ), five independent spectral measurements\nwere taken on each of three randomly chosen glandular elements and\nadjacent stroma. In CaP regions, three independent spectral measurements\nwere taken on each of five randomly chosen glandular elements and five\nspectral measurements were taken of adjacent stroma. During FTIR analyses\na new background was taken every 2 h and\/or before commencing analysis\nof another sample. Spectra were baseline corrected using OPUS software\nand normalized to the amide II (\u00021533 cm\u00031) absorbance band.\nBiochemical spectral derivations\nAfter baseline correction and normalization to amide II, the ratio of nucleic\nacids (RNA\/DNA) was determined as the absorbance ratio of band\nintensities at 1121 cm\u00031 and 1020 cm\u00031 (13). This was derived using\nOPUS software as was the integrated absorbance of the carbohydrate region\n(900\u20131185 cm\u00031) and nucleic acid phosphates (1185\u20131300 cm\u00031) (13).\nStatistical analysis\nAll spectra were processed as first derivative (15 points) after baseline\ncorrection and normalization, employing PCA conducted using the Pirouette\nsoftware package (Infometrix, Woodinville, WA) (14). As mentioned above,\nto derive an accurate loadings curve (pseudospectrum) to define those\nregions of the spectra that exhibit biomolecular and\/or conformational\nchanges, we developed a semigraphical method that constructs a \u2018\u2018cluster\nvector\u2019\u2019, passing through the median of the cluster (see Supplementary\nMaterial). A cluster vector does not represent a real PC as it is not orthogonal\nto the real PCs. However, its loadings curve may be calculated simply by\ntaking a weighted average of the components of the loadings of three real\nPCs that were used to identify the cluster. This weighted averaging is done\non the basis of simple vector algebra (see Supplementary Material): using\nthe Pirouette loadings spreadsheet for each PC in turn, its eigenvalue is\nmultiplied by the cosine of the angle through which it has been projected\nonto the plane of view in hyperspace in which the cluster vector is located. It\nis further multiplied by the cosine of the angle that it makes with the cluster\nvector. The weighting factor thus derived is then used to multiply this PC\u2019s\nloadings for all wavenumbers. The same is done for the remaining two PCs.\nThen for each wavenumber, these weighted loadings are added and the\nresultant data give a single loadings curve for the cluster in question.\nElectron microscopy\nAfter dissection, prostate tissue fragments (;50 mg; PZ PEC4) were placed\nin glutaraldehyde (4% in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer). After fixation,\ntissues were washed in sodium cacodylate buffer, postfixed in osmium\ntetroxide, dehydrated in an alcohol series, and embedded in araldite resin.\nUltrathin sections (70 nm) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome\n(Reichert-Jung, Wien, Austria) and stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead\ncitrate before being examined on a JEOL JEM-1010 transmission electron\nmicroscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) (3).\nRESULTS\nProstate tissue architecture\nElectron microscopy showed secretory columnar cells sitting\non flattened basal cells attached to a basement membrane in\nCaP-free prostate glands (Fig. 1 A). With increasing Gleason\ngrade, increasing dedifferentiation compared to CaP-free\ntissue occurs (21). Only patients preoperatively diagnosed\nwith low-grade carcinoma were recruited into this study.\nThis approach allowed us the possibility to interrogate using\nIR spectroscopy, relatively normal tissue independently of\nand in comparison to CaP. Ultrastructural analysis of epi-\nthelial cells lining CaP glands (Fig. 1 B) clearly showed the\npresence of an increased number of vesicles (i.e., white cir-\ncular entities in the cytoplasm of these cells). This could be\nassociated with an elevated secretion of extracellular mate-\nrial. The double-cell epithelial architecture (i.e., secretory\ncolumnar cells sitting on flattened basal cells) characteristic\nof CaP-free prostate glands was also apparent after H&E\nstaining (Fig. 1 C). PZ tissue architecture was characterized\nby the presence of many glandular elements with relatively\nIR Spectroscopy of Prostate Epithelial Cells 3785\nBiophysical Journal 90(10) 3783\u20133795\nlittle stromalmaterial (Fig. 1D). Although the TZ often contains\nmarkedly fewer glandular elements and large amounts of\nstromal material, the glandular architecture in this tissue region\nwas similar to that observed in the PZ (Fig. 1 E). Exploiting the\nphase-contrast facility of the Thermo Nicolet Continuum\nmicroscope, the 10 mm 3 10 mm aperture was focused along\nthe edge of epithelial cells lining the lumen; in CaP-free glands,\nspectra were acquired in five separate locations (Fig. 1 F). A\nfeature of CaP regions was the presence of small, circular\nglands; primarily to minimize the possibility of taking more\nthan one spectral reading from the same area, only three\nseparate spectra were acquired from CaP glands (Fig. 1 G).\nSpectral readings (n \u00bc 5) were also acquired from surrounding\nstromal material (Fig. 1 H).\nEpithelial cell spectra\nFig. 2 shows that spectral variation obtained using the \u0002250\nmm 3 250 mm octagon-shaped sampling area of ATR spec-\ntroscopy (Fig. 2, A, C, E, G, I, and K) was markedly less than\nthat observed after analysis with the 10 mm 3 10 mm syn-\nchrotron IR beam (Fig. 2, B, D, F, H, J, and L). A vibrational\nspectrum of tissue biochemistry was obtainable from dewaxed\nsections microtomed from paraffin-embedded blocks al-\nthough a paraffin band at \u00021462 cm\u00031 (in the form of two\nsharp peaks) remaineddiscernible in some spectra (22). Spectra\nwere normalized to the amide II peak; normalization to the\nhigher-intensity amide I peak tended to exaggeratedly narrow\nthe variability in the spectral region (\u00021490\u20131000 cm\u00031)\ncontaining DNA\/RNA. Surprisingly, IR spectra acquired from\nCaP areas often exhibited less heterogeneity compared to\nthose derived from CaP-free tissue regions (e.g., Fig. 2 L).\nHowever, upon graphical examination of all the IR spectral\ndata derived from this relatively small cohort number, no\ndiscernible tissue region-specific characteristics were readily\nobservable (Fig. 2, A\u2013L). Indicating a protein-conformation\nalteration, a marked shift (\u00025 cm\u00031) in the centroid of the\namide I peak of CaP areas (\u00021645 cm\u00031) compared to PZ or\nTZ regions (\u00021640 cm\u00031) was noted (see Supplementary\nMaterial), especially for tissuesPEC1,PEC2,PEC3, andPEC4.\nPrevious studies have pointed to marked differences in IR\nabsorbance patterns between \u00021000\u20131200 cm\u00031 (23); this is\nnot readily apparent in our data (Fig. 2, A\u2013L).\nStromal spectra\nStroma that surround the glandular elements of a tissue are\nbelieved to provide important growth\/signaling factors to\nadjacent epithelial cell populations and are believed to modu-\nlate the appropriate functioning of normal cells; likewise,\nstromal mediators may influence progression and survival of\nmalignant cells (24). Altered function might result in altera-\ntions in the spectral signature of CaP stroma compared to\ncancer free. Individual spectra of prostate CaP stroma after\nATR spectroscopy appeared to exhibit markedly less varia-\ntion compared to those acquired using synchrotron FTIR\nmicrospectroscopy (Fig. 3). As observed in the distribution\nof IR spectra derived from epithelial cells, there was no\nconsistent tissue region-specific trend in this relatively small\ncohort, i.e., the wavenumber intensities of IR spectra derived\nfrom one tissue region were not consistently higher or lower\ncompared to another. Normalization of spectra to the amide\nII peak highlighted marked intertissue (e.g., Fig. 3 J) and\nintratissue (e.g., Fig. 3 B) spectral variation in the DNA\/RNA\nFIGURE 1 Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy to interrogate prostate\ncells (epithelial versus stromal) in situ. Employing electron microscopy and\nlight microscopy, prostatic glandular architecture was noted. Exploiting the\nphase contrast facility of the Thermo Nicolet continuum microscope, the\nlocation of the 10 mm3 10 mm aperture was tracked.

No shift of the centroid of the amide I\npeak of stroma was observed in any of the tissue sets exam-\nined (data not shown).\nSpectral differences between tissue regions\nAfter baseline correction and normalization, the spectra were\nprocessed as first-derivative (15 points) spectra using Pir-\nouette. First-derivative processing was employed to counter\nthe influence of low frequency effects or dispersion artifacts\nsuch as Mie scattering (25). Because 90% of variance was\ninitially associated with minor shifts in amide I (i.e., the most\nintense peak) and\/or amide II, we looked for spectral varia-\ntion in the region containing DNA\/RNA bands (\u00021490\u2013\n1000 cm\u00031); PCA was conducted on this latter spectral\nregion. Six PCs (in total .90% spectral variation) were\nselected for analysis (see Supplementary Material), and\nloadings curves for each PC were plotted for each tissue set\n(data not shown). These loadings curves allowed the influ-\nence of specific spectral features on each PC to be identified;\ne.g., for four tissue sets, PC1 describes variability in peaks\nbelow 1140 cm\u00031. Scores plots (two-dimensional (2-D)) of\neach PC pair were then plotted for each tissue set and by\ncombining the clustering evident in these figures (see Sup-\nplementary Material) with the analysis of the loadings\ncurves, PCs 1, 2, and 4 were selected as the most appropriate\nfor subsequent three-dimensional (3-D) PCA.

Conversely, the most similar cell types\nappeared to be epithelial cells located in the TZ compared to\nthose in CaP regions (Table 2).\nIdentification of clusters using principal\ncomponent analysis\nPCA (3-D) of epithelial cell spectra was performed to\ndetermine if segregation of different tissue regions might be\nachieved along chosen PCs (1, 2, and 4) and whether rotated\ndata might point to similarities or differences. Using these\nthree PCs it proved possible to obtain segregated clustering\nfor cancer-free and CaP regions with all tissue sets except\nPEC4 (Fig. 5). Spectra derived from this tissue set did not\nexhibit any significant clustering; the example shown in Fig.\n5 D uses PCs 3, 4, and 6. Fig. 5, A\u2013F, shows 3-D scores plots\nfor PEC1\u2013PEC6, respectively, after analyses using synchro-\ntron FTIR microspectroscopy (for scores plots acquired\nusing ATR spectroscopy, see Supplementary Material). In\nthe main, cell spectra from the different tissue regions (PZ,\nTZ, or CaP) formed clusters. Nearness in multivariate\ndistance implies spectral similarity, and separation in the 3-D\nplots signifies spectral differences. In general, there was\ngood separation between CaP-free tissues (PZ or TZ) and\nCaP pointing to the potential of multivariate analysis of IR\nspectra to segregate different cell types of the prostate.\nSomewhat surprisingly, in two cases (PEC3 (Fig. 5 C) and\nPEC6 (Fig. 5 F)) TZ-derived spectral scores seem to be more\nclosely aligned to CaP spectra. However, in this relatively\nsmall patient cohort (n \u00bc 6) such observations may not be in-\ndicative of a general occurrence; this would need to be tested\nin a population-based study.\nCarbohydrate\/phosphate ratio versus\nRNA\/DNA ratio\nA number of measures of cellular metabolic status were\nobtainable even after paraffin-embedding and dewaxing;\nthese may be potential diagnostic indicators (13,26,27). An\nexamination of such spectrally derived biomarkers for\nepithelial cells revealed marked intra- and inter-individual\ndifferences when carbohydrate\/phosphate ratio was plotted\nagainst RNA\/DNA ratio (Fig. 6). Higher RNA\/DNA ratio\nis associated with increasing malignancy (26) as are lower\ncarbohydrate and phosphate levels (28).

TZ epithelial cells appeared to\nexhibit intermediate levels of these biomarkers (Fig. 6 B).\nPZ versus TZ cryosections of unfixed tissue\nFrom a CaP-free prostate obtained after cystoprostatectomy,\nisolated PZ and TZ tissue slices were snap frozen within 10\nmin of surgical resection. The value of this tissue was that it\nallowed an IR interrogation of different tissue regions within\na CaP-free organ; cryosections from snap-frozen tissues were\nanalyzed to allow for spectral comparisons with dewaxed\nparaffin-embedded sections previously used. PZ and TZ\nepithelial cell spectra were obtained using synchrotron FTIR\nmicrospectroscopic analysis of 10-mm-thick cryosections on\nBaF2 windows. PZ epithelial cell spectra appeared to be\ntightly grouped, whereas those of the TZ exhibited marked\nvariations in wavenumber intensities (see Supplementary\nMaterial). This gave rise to very apparent differences in\nmedian spectra acquired from the two tissue regions (Fig. 7\nA). A peak in wavenumber intensity was observable in both\ntissue-specific spectra between the \u00021700\u20131750 cm\u00031\nregion and this may be associated with C\u00bcO stretching\nvibrations of lipids (1740 cm\u00031). It appeared to be more\npronounced in PZ compared to TZ and these wavenumber\nintensities were not observed in the dewaxed tissue sections\n(PEC1\u2013PEC6). There were also marked differences in the\nspectral region (\u00021490\u20131000 cm\u00031) containing DNA\/RNA\nwith median intensity elevations in glycoproteins (\u00021380\ncm\u00031), amide III (\u00021260 cm\u00031), and carbohydrates (\u00021155\ncm\u00031) being associated with PZ epithelial cell spectra\ncompared to TZ (Fig. 7 A). However, the most marked\nchanges in the pattern of IR absorbance occurred between\n\u00021000\u20131200 cm\u00031. Based on the aforementioned spectral\nattributions, these spectral differences (many associated with\nstructural alterations in nucleic acids) translated into strong\ncluster separation between PZ and TZ scores in 3-D plots\nalong PCs 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 7 B). It is interesting to note that\nno overlap in epithelial cell clusters derived from either of\nthe two tissue regions was observed. This points to marked\nbiomolecular and\/or conformational differences between epi-\nthelial cells located in these two tissue regions of the human\nprostate (Fig. 7 B).\nDISCUSSION\nProstate tissue consists of branched tubuloacinar glands em-\nbedded in a fibromuscular stroma. It is a hormone-responsive\norgan divided into the TZ (surrounds the urethra, \u00025% of\nnormal organ volume), the CZ (surrounds the ejaculatory\nducts, \u000220% of normal organ volume), and the PZ (contains\nthe bulk of glandular tissue, \u000275% of normal organ volume)\n(1,2). Androgens are believed to stimulate prostatic growth\nand secretory functions, whereas estrogens are believed to act\nas growth inhibitors (29). Within the gland there appears to be\na zone-specific susceptibility to malignancy, in that CaP rarely\noriginates in the CZ but occurs mostly in the PZ and to a lesser\ndegree in the TZ (3). This apparent tissue-specific resistance to\nthe progression of invasive carcinoma is shared by adjacent\nreproductive organs such as the vas deferens, epididymis, and\nseminal vesicles (30). BPH, a nonmalignant overgrowth of the\nepithelial and fibromuscular tissues, is mainly confined to\nthe TZ (3,31). Given the high incidence of CaP, especially in\nan ageing population, there is an urgent need to develop a\nbiomarker approach to monitor and identify individuals at risk\nof progression to invasive disease. By comparing IR spectra\nderived from 10-mm-thick sections of PZ, TZ, or CaP, we set\nout to determine whether it was possible to identify potential\nbiomarkers of susceptibility in the CaP-susceptible region.\nCaP incidence is increasing steadily in most countries\nworldwide (6), yet its etiology remains obscure (10). Envi-\nronmental agents that might induce genomic damage (32) or\nproliferative stimuli (33) might play a key role in initiation\nand\/or promotion of this disease. Age-related structural\nchanges (e.g., 8-hydroxypurine lesions) give rise to a DNA\nphenotype in nonmalignant prostate tissues of older men\nFIGURE 5 3-D scores plots on PCs selected to demonstrate best\nsegregation of epithelial cell spectra derived from the different tissue\nregions. Spectra were collected using synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy.\nEach spectrum for each tissue region (PZ, black circles; TZ, blue squares;\nCaP, red triangles) was expressed in terms of chosen PCs using Pirouette\nsoftware and rotated to identify segregation of different clusters. Each\nsymbol represents a single spectrum as a single point in \u2018\u2018hyperspace\u2019\u2019. The\n3-D scores plots represent the following: (A) PEC1 on PC1, PC2, and PC4;\n(B) PEC2 on PC1, PC4, and PC5; (C) PEC3 on PC1, PC2, and PC6; (D)\nPEC4 on PC2, PC3, and PC4; (E) PEC5 on PC2, PC3, and PC5; and (F)\nPEC6 on PC1, PC4, and PC5.\nIR Spectroscopy of Prostate Epithelial Cells 3791\nBiophysical Journal 90(10) 3783\u20133795\n(aged 55\u201380 y) with features similar to primary CaP (34). In\nnormal prostate, a metastatic CaP DNA phenotype also\noccurs that shares structural similarities to DNA isolated\nfrom metastasizing tumors; this exhibits a distinctly different\nconformation compared to the primary CaP phenotype (35).\nStructural modifications of phosphodiester-deoxyribose that\naccompany mutagenic base changes may be a result of en-\nvironmental exposure to chemicals (36) but are more likely\nto be the result of subsequent events (e.g., oxidative damage)\nthat accelerate genomic instability and consequently result in\nadditional mutagenic damage (37). This is powerful evi-\ndence supporting the use of IR spectroscopy to identify bio-\nmarkers of CaP progression.\nWe employed two spectroscopic methods (ATR spectros-\ncopy and synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy) to rigor-\nously interrogate prostate tissue sets consisting of CaP-free\nPZ, CaP-free TZ, and CaP isolated from a cohort of men\n(n \u00bc 7) aged 58\u201368 y (Table 1). ATR spectroscopy acquired\nspectra within a \u0002250 mm 3 250 mm octagon-shaped sam-\npling area, whereas a 10 mm3 10 mm aperture was used for\nsynchrotron FTIR microspectroscopic analyses. Although\nthe effective depth of the evanescent wave in ATR spec-\ntroscopy may vary with wavenumber, this technique is very\ncomparable to a transmission measurement and, given that\ntissue sections analyzed in this study were at most 10-mm\nthick, we would expect that representative spectra were ob-\ntained from our samples. Nevertheless, both techniques high-\nlighted similar spectral characteristics, despite the fact that\nspectra obtained after ATR spectroscopy exhibited markedly\nless variability compared to the high degree of intra-\ntissue variability often observed after synchrotron FTIR\nmicrospectroscopy (Figs. 1 and 2, see Supplementary Mate-\nrial). The reason may be that with ATR spectroscopy, the\nbigger sampling area results in an averaging of spectral\nsignatures of tens of cells, depending on the positioning of\nthe crystal. In contrast, a method such as synchrotron FTIR\nmicrospectroscopy may interrogate an individual\u000210 mm3\n10 mm epithelial or stromal cell. This averaging effect with\nATR spectroscopy would have the advantage of delivering a\nbiochemical cell signature over a wider surface area. A\ndisadvantage would be that a signature unique to a particular\ncell type might be lost in such an averaged spectrum and for\nthis purpose, synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy might be\nemployed to facilitate single-cell interrogation. However, it\nis of note that 3-D scores plots examining the clustering of\nindividual tissue-derived spectra do point to comparable\nFIGURE 6 2-D plots of the ratios for carbohydrate\n(quantified by the integrated absorbance in the 900\u20131185\ncm\u00031 region) to phosphates of nucleic acids (quantified by\nthe integrated absorbance in the 1185\u20131300 cm\u00031 region)\nversus RNA\/DNA (based on the intensity at wavenumber\n1121 cm\u00031\/intensity at 1020 cm\u00031). Each symbol repre-\nsents the mean 6 SD of all the spectrally derived esti-\nmations for one tissue region (PZ, TZ, or CaP). The 2-D\nplots represent the following: (A) spectrally derived estima-\ntions for PZ; (B) spectrally derived estimations for TZ; and\n(C) spectrally derived estimations for CaP. These estima-\ntions were derived using OPUS software.\n3792 German et al.\nBiophysical Journal 90(10) 3783\u20133795\nfindings from both methods (Fig. 5, see Supplementary\nMaterial). For instance, using both techniques, spectra from\nall three tissue regions (PZ, TZ, or CaP) of PEC1 show good\nclustering compared to those of PEC3 that suggest a closer\nalignment of TZ-derived spectra to CaP, whereas those of\nPEC6 point to a strong similarity between PZ and TZ but a\nsegregation of both from CaP. In this relatively small patient\ncohort, no consistent clustering effects were observed,\nsuggesting that inter-individual variation in biochemistry\nmay outweigh the potential to identify specific biomarkers\nwithin this pilot study.\nA molecular mechanism for region-specific susceptibility\nto different pathologies in the prostate remains obscure. One\npossible explanation may be that the urogenital sinus is the\ntissue of origin for most of the prostate gland including the\nPZ and TZ, whereas regions that remain relatively free of\ndisease arise from the mesonepheric duct, e.g., the CZ (1).\nThis would suggest that epithelial cells of different regions\nthat differ in their embryonic origin also differ in their\nsusceptibility to pathological stimuli. Another explanation\nmight be the presence of region-specific hormonal and\ngrowth factor influences that might serve to modulate disease\nprogression. Higher levels of epidermal growth factor, testos-\nterone, and dihydrotestosterone in the periurethral (TZ) region\ncompared to the subcapsular (PZ) region of the prostate might\nexplain region-specific BPH development (38). Immunohis-\ntochemical (IHC) analysis for p-class glutathione-S-transfer-\nase (GST), an important detoxification enzyme, in TZ and PZ\nhigh-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) showed\nthat GST p was present in TZ PIN but was absent in PZ PIN\n(39). Further IHC analysis for estrogen receptors showed that\natrophic changes of PZ were more immunoreactive than\nhyperplastic lesions of TZ (40). Tissue regional differences in\nstromal components may also occur. A decrease in smooth\nmuscle cells and an increase in collagen fibers may occur in\nthe PZ compared to TZ (41). Finally, the hormone- and\/or\ncarcinogen-metabolizing capacity of epithelial cells residing\nin different zones might differ (3). This may further influence\ntheir viability, especially in response to sex steroid addition,\ne.g., PZ epithelial cells more viable compared to TZ (42).\nThe cluster vectors are from the 0,0 of 3-D hyperspace and\nso may not give a direct comparison of the variance between\nthe median spectra of one cluster and another but our novel\napproach, as opposed to examining the loadings curves of\neach PC in turn, does give a better idea of where the variance\nlies. An examination of the spectral variance between PZ,\nTZ, or CaP regions suggests that PZ versus TZ epithelial cell\nspectra exhibit differences throughout the \u00021490\u20131000\ncm\u00031 region after interrogation with either IR spectroscopy\ntechnique (Fig. 4, B and D, Table 2). This suggests that\nsignificant differences do exist in the biochemistry of pros-\ntate epithelial cells depending on whether they reside in the\nTZ or PZ and is of great importance for future studies that\nwill set out to identify the relative importance of these po-\ntential biomarkers. For instance, a more intense wavenumber\npeak that might be associated with increased lipid content\nmay point to increased hormone responsiveness in the PZ\ncompared to the TZ (Fig. 7 A). A tissue (micro)environment\ncontaining higher hormone levels may act as a driver for the\nprogression of CaP (3). Such observations would support the\nnotion of an underlying biochemistry for an enhanced\nsusceptibility to adenocarcinoma in PZ epithelial cells com-\npared to TZ. However, fewer epithelial cell spectral differ-\nences were observed when comparing TZ versus CaP as\nopposed to PZ versus CaP (Fig. 4 D) and if these occurred,\nthey were localized between \u00021000\u20131200 cm\u00031.\nOur observations are surprising because one might rea-\nsonably expect that the apparently more susceptible (i.e., to\nadenocarcinoma) PZ epithelial cells would be spectrally\nmore similar to CaP. However, further support for our\nfinding is that PZ epithelial cells have higher carbohydrate\/\nphosphate ratios and lower RNA\/DNA ratios compared to\nCaP cells, whereas those of the TZ exhibit intermediate\nFIGURE 7 Median spectra and 3-D scores plots on PCs selected to\ndemonstrate segregation of spectra derived from epithelial cells of PZ versus\nTZ isolated from a cystoprostatectomy specimen (PEC7). Spectra were\ncollected using synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy, and medians were\nderived from all the spectra acquired for a particular tissue region (PZ, black\nline; TZ, blue line). Each spectrum for each tissue region (PZ, black circles\nTZ, blue squares) were expressed in terms of chosen PCs using the Pirouette\nsoftware and rotated to identify segregation of different clusters.\nIR Spectroscopy of Prostate Epithelial Cells 3793\nBiophysical Journal 90(10) 3783\u20133795\nlevels (Fig. 6). Although ATR spectroscopy suggests that\nmarked differences exist between TZ versus CaP, this vari-\nance is markedly localized after synchrotron FTIR micro-\nspectroscopy (Table 2). This spectrally derived biochemical\ninformation again suggests that TZ epithelial cells are more\nsimilar to CaP. Because of the larger sampling area involved\nin ATR spectroscopy, acquired spectra may not be totally\nepithelial cell derived. However, synchrotron FTIR micro-\nspectroscopy allows for the direct focusing of the IR beam on\ntarget cells of interest. Future plans for the development of a\nmethodology for high resolution IR analysis will involve a\nrecently established microspectroscopic technique, known as\nphotothermal microspectroscopy (PTMS) (14). PTMS al-\nlows the acquisition of subcellular spatial resolution without\nthe need to involve the elaborate and costly synchrotron\nfacilities.\nThe TZ is the region where most pathology (i.e., BPH and\n25% CaP) occurs in the human prostate, and it is not in-\nconceivable that a zone-specific factor (i.e., hormonal) might\nbe an important driver in CaP progression. It is possible that\nour studies using IR spectroscopy have picked up biochem-\nical alterations such as initiating events to which epithelial\ncells of the TZ are as susceptible, if not more so, as those of\nthe PZ. However, in the absence of a putative stimulus (e.g.,\nhormone exposure) such initiated cells may not progress into\ninvasive CaP. In a tissue region that may receive fewer\nmutation hits but contain a far greater number of potential\ntargets (i.e., epithelial cells of glandular elements), the pres-\nence of a growth-promoting effect may be an important risk\nfactor. Although observed in a small patient number, our\nresults might explain the excess of nonmalignant overgrowth\nin the TZ, i.e., initiating events may occur to give rise to a\nCaP-like phenotype but in the absence of a suitable stimulus\nthese initiated cells do not progress to CaP.\nOur study and others (13,23,26,27,34,35,37) point to the\nrealistic possibility of employing archival material (e.g.,\nparaffin-embedded tissue blocks, frozen tissues) to investi-\ngate spectral alterations associated with disease progression\nand to link these observations with susceptibility, biochem-\nical influences, and diagnostic\/prognostic indicators. The\nability of IR spectroscopy to sensitively monitor metabolic\nprocesses in tissues or cells does provide important structural\ninformation (43). The elucidation of tissue-specific suscep-\ntibility remains an important challenge, and the use of\nspectroscopic methods may be an important tool to inves-\ntigate this, especially in retrospective studies where findings\nmay be linked to individual details or prognostic outcome.\nSurprisingly, although our findings point to the ability of IR\nspectroscopy with multivariate analysis to segregate differ-\nent cell types of the prostate, it appears in the tissues we\nexamined that TZ epithelial cells possess a more similar\nbiochemical cell spectral fingerprint to CaP compared to\nthose in the apparently more susceptible PZ region. The role\nof underlying growth-promoting effects that might accelerate\ntransformation in the prostate requires urgent attention.\nCONCLUSIONS\nSpectrally designated structural characteristics allow, with\nPCA, the segregation of spectral scores derived from dif-\nferent regions (PZ, TZ, and\/or CaP) of the prostate. As\ndetected by synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy with its\npowerful ability to target individual cells, differences be-\ntween epithelium of the TZ versus CaP are markedly fewer\ncompared to PZ versus CaP. The prostate tissue regions that\nwere most dissimilar are PZ versus TZ. PZ exhibits a higher\noccurrence of CaP, so other mechanisms (e.g., hormone\nexposure) may modulate the growth kinetics of initiated\nepithelial cells in this tissue region. Otherwise, because the\nPZ contains a far greater number of potential targets (i.e.,\nepithelial cells) for mutation hits, it may be at a greater risk.\nFor the development of IR spectroscopy as a monitoring and\/\nor diagnostic tool, future work will require the interrogation\nof large patient cohorts to build a database of normal versus\nabnormal biochemical cell spectral fingerprints to eliminate\nconfounding factors such as interindividual variation.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nAn online supplement to this article can be found by visiting\nBJ Online at http:\/\/www.biophysj.org.\nWe thank John M.
