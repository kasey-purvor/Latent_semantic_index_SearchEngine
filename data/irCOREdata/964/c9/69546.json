Introduction\nLower hybrid (LH) waves play an important role in space\nand laboratory plasmas due to their ability to interact efficiently\nwith electrons propagating along the magnetic field lines and\nwith ions in the transverse plane. Such waves are generated by\ndifferent mechanisms (e.g., by electron or ion beams and also\nin processes of waves interaction and transformation). In the\nEarth\u2019s ionosphere LH waves can be excited at various heights.\nLocalized bursts of LH waves (the so-called spikelets) were\ndetected in the upper ionosphere by rockets and satellites in\nconnection with the elongated plasma depletions [1\u20133]. It was\nargued that such spikelets could be trapped in plasma deple-\ntions. Possibility of LH waves trapping at the frequencies below\nthe lower hybrid resonance (LHR) frequency of the ambient\nplasma has been investigated theoretically in the most simple\nform (cold plasma approximation, that is neglecting thermal\ncorrections), see [4\u20136].\nAt lower altitudes (below the maximum of the F-layer) LH\nwaves can also be generated artificially under the action of\npowerful HF radio waves [7]. The generated LH waves appear\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: n.borisov@lancaster.ac.uk (N.

However, the\nmechanism of LH waves trapping in striations, similar to the\ntrapping of LH waves in natural plasma depletions in the upper\nionosphere [4\u20136] has not been reported in the literature. It is\nimportant that the trapping of LH waves could increase the effi-\nciency of their excitation because the waves do not go far from\nthe region of interaction (in the same manner as the trapping of\nthe UHR waves in striations influence their intensity).\nThe aim of this Letter is to present a theory describing the\ntrapping of LH waves in a warm plasma in elongated plasma de-\npletions (either artificial or natural). This theory is based on the\ndifferential equation of the fourth order that takes into account\nthermal corrections. It will be shown that in such approach a\nnew solution describing the trapping of LH waves with the fre-\nquencies above the local LHR frequency can be obtained. Such\nsolution not provided in previous theoretical investigations, [4\u2013\n6], is of prime importance because in ionospheric modification\nexperiments LH waves with frequencies above the LHR fre-\nquency are supposed to be involved in the generation of sec-\nondary electromagnetic radiation\u2014the stimulated electromag-\nnetic emission (SEE).\nN. Borisov, F. Honary \/ Physics Letters A 372 (2008) 2440\u20132445 24412. Basic equations\nOur aim is to derive the linear differential equation describ-\ning the LH perturbations in plasma depletions taking into ac-\ncount thermal corrections. Ionospheric plasma is supposed to\nbe weakly inhomogeneous. The magnetic field is assumed to\nbe directed along the z-axis and the background inhomogeneity\nof plasma concentration is considered along the x-axis. As the\nLH perturbations are electrostatic ones, we introduce the elec-\ntric potential in the form\n(1)\u03a6 = \u03a60(x) exp\n[\ni(\u03c9t \u2212 kyy \u2212 kzz)\n]\n.\nHere potential \u03a6 describes the electric field E = \u2212\u2207\u03a6 , \u03c9 is\nLH wave frequency, ky , kz are the LH wave numbers along the\ny- and the z-axes correspondingly.\nFor electrons we use the equation of motion\n(2)i\u03c9ve = e\nm\n\u2207\u03a6 \u2212 \u03c9He[ve \u00d7 H] \u2212 Te\nmN0\n\u2207ne\nand the continuity equation\n(3)i\u03c9ne + \u2207N0ve = 0.\nHere ve is the drift speed of electrons, e, m are the electric\ncharge and the mass of electron, H is the magnetic field, \u03c9He\nis the Larmour frequency of electron, Te is the electron tem-\nperature, N0 and ne are the background plasma density and the\nsmall perturbation of concentration of electrons caused by the\nLH oscillations.\nIons are non-magnetized since the LHR frequency \u03c9LHR is\nmuch larger than the Larmour frequency of ions \u03c9Hi . In such\ncase, following the kinetic approach, the expression for the per-\nturbation of the ion concentration ni that can be presented as\n(4)ni = \u2212 1\n\u03c92\n[\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n(\neN0\nM\n\u2202\u03a60\n\u2202x\n)\n\u2212 eN0\nM\n(\nk2y + k2z\n)\n\u03a60\n]\n.\nHere M is the mass of ions. The link between the electric poten-\ntial \u03a60 and the perturbations ni and ne is given by the Poisson\nequation\n(5)\u2207E = 4\u03c0e(ni \u2212 ne).\nCombining Eqs. (2)\u2013(5) we are in a position to find a differ-\nential equation for the electric potential \u03a60. In general case this\nequation is too complicated. Later on we shall concentrate on\none particular case, assuming that the perturbations are strongly\nelongated in the direction of the magnetic field. Also we sup-\npose that the frequency of perturbations is much smaller than\nthe plasma frequency of ions \u03c9 \u0004 \u03c9Pi . Hence the following\napproximate equation can be derived\n\u03c12e\n(\n\u22022\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 k2y\n)(\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u03c92P i\n\u03c92\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u2212 \u03c9\n2\nP i\n\u03c92\nk2y\n)\n\u03a60\n+ \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n\u03c92Pe\n\u03c92He\n+ 1 \u2212 \u03c9\n2\nP i\n\u03c92\n)\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u03a60\n\u2212 k2y\n(\n\u03c92Pe\n\u03c92\n+ 1 \u2212 \u03c9\n2\nP i\n\u03c92\n)\n\u03a60He(6)+\u03c9\n2\nPe\n\u03c92\n(\nk2z \u2212 \u03banky\n\u03c9\n\u03c9He\n)\n\u03a60 = 0.\nHere \u03c1e is the Larmour radius of electrons \u03c1e = VT e\/\u03c9He, VT e\nis the thermal velocity of electrons, the plasma frequency of\nions is \u03c9Pi = (4\u03c0e2N0\/M)1\/2, \u03ban characterizes the inhomo-\ngeneity along the x-axis \u03ban = \u2202N0N0\u2202x , and the LHR frequency is\n(7)\u03c9LHR = \u03c9Pi\u03c9He\n(\u03c92Pe + \u03c92He)1\/2\n.\nNote, that the LHR frequency varies with plasma concentra-\ntion, because plasma frequencies of electron and ion depend on\nthe concentration of charged particles. In the geometric optics\napproximation when the dependence on the x-coordinate takes\nthe form\n\u03a60 \u221d exp\n(\n\u2212i\nx\u222b\nkx(x1) dx1\n)\nwe arrive at the following dispersion relation \u03c9 = \u03c9(k) that\nfollows from Eq. (6)\n\u03c12e\n(\nk2x + k2y\n)2 + (k2x + k2y)\n(\n1 \u2212 \u03c9\n2\n\u03c92LHR\n)\n(8)+ M\nm\n(\nk2z \u2212 \u03banky\n\u03c9\n\u03c9He\n)\n= 0.\nEq. (8) without the last term (\u221d \u03banky ) presents the well-known\ndependence of the LH wave frequency on the transverse kx\nand ky and the longitudinal kz wave numbers taking into ac-\ncount thermal corrections, see, e.g., [9]. The last term in Eq. (8)\ncorresponds to the drift motion of magnetized electrons in the\ninhomogeneous plasma.\nEq. (6) contains small parameter \u03c12e before the highest or-\nder derivative. Due to this Eq. (6) has two types of solutions.\nOne of them describes small-scale oscillations for which ther-\nmal corrections are definitely important. The second solution\ncorresponds to perturbations with larger scales. In some cases\na link between two types of solutions appears in the vicinity of\na particular point x0. There is some similarity between Eq. (6)\nthat describes LH waves with thermal corrections and equation\nfor UH waves discussed in [10]. The latter is also a differen-\ntial equation of the fourth order that contains small parameter\n(r2d is the square of the Debye radius) before the highest order\nderivative. It is known that such equation also has two types\nof solutions [11]. The small-scale solution corresponds to UH\nwaves that can be trapped inside striations, while the large-scale\none is known as the slow extraordinary mode leaking from stri-\nations (the so-called Z-mode).\nIn the next sections we shall discuss the situations when\nEqs. (6), (8) describe trapped perturbations with the frequen-\ncies either above or below the LHR frequency of the ambient\nplasma.\n3. Trapping of LH waves in striations\nLH waves excited in heating experiments are expected to\nhave frequencies above the LHR frequency of the ambient\nplasma. Indeed, LH waves are supposed to be involved in the\n2442 N. Borisov, F. Honary \/ Physics Letters A 372 (2008) 2440\u20132445formation of the downshifted maximum (DM) of the secondary\nelectromagnetic radiation. DM is a rather broad structure with\nthe frequency offshift from the heating frequency equal to the\nLHR frequency [7]. To discuss the trapping of LH oscillations,\ntwo-dimensional case (ky = 0) will be considered in this sec-\ntion. Note, that the theory presented in [4\u20136] does not provide\nwave trapping in such case. In 2D case Eq. (6) reduces to\n\u03c12e\n\u22023\n\u2202x3\n\u03c92P i\n\u03c92\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u03a60 + \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n\u03c92Pe\n\u03c92He\n+ 1 \u2212 \u03c9\n2\nP i\n\u03c92\n)\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\u03a60\n(9)+ \u03c9\n2\nPe\n\u03c92\nk2z\u03a60 = 0.\nIt is convenient to present this equation in the following form\n\u03c12e\n1\nNa\n\u22023\n\u2202x3\nNa\n\u2202\u03a60\n\u2202x\n+ 1\nNa\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n[\nNa\n(\n\u03c92\n\u03c92LHR\n\u2212 1\n)]\n\u2202\u03a60\n\u2202x\n(10)+ M\nm\nk2z\u03a60 = 0.\nHere Na is the ambient plasma concentration which consists of\nthe background concentration N0 and small negative part \u03b4n(x)\ndescribing the distribution of plasma in a given striation\n(11)Na = N0 + \u03b4n(x).\nEq. (10) can be simplified further neglecting the terms \u221d \u03ban.\nIndeed for small-scale oscillations when thermal corrections\ncome into play such terms are insignificant. For large-scale os-\ncillations thermal term with the highest order derivative can be\nneglected. As a result we come to the second-order differen-\ntial equation in which the mentioned terms can be excluded by\nstandard substitution \u03a60 = \u03a61\/\u221anr , where nr is the relative\nplasma density nr = Na\/N0. The additional terms that appear\ndue to such substitution are insignificant. So, from now on, we\ndeal with the following equation\n(12)\u03c12e\n\u22024\u03a60\n\u2202x4\n+ \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n\u03c92\n\u03c92LHR\n\u2212 1\n)\n\u2202\u03a60\n\u2202x\n+ M\nm\nk2z\u03a60 = 0.\nIt should be mentioned that differential equations of the fourth\norder with small parameter before the highest order derivative\nare rather common in plasma physics. For example, similar\nequations have been investigated in relation to the problems of\nwaves transformation in the inhomogeneous plasma (Alfvenic\nand flute oscillations) [12].\nIn the geometric optics approximation Eq. (12) reduces to\n(13)\u03c12e k4x \u2212 A(x)k2x + B = 0,\nwhere\nA(x) = \u03c9\n2\n\u03c92LHR(x)\n\u2212 1, B = M\nm\nk2z .\nSolutions of Eq. (13) are the following\n(14)k2x =\nA(x)\n2\u03c12He\n\u00b1\n\u221a\nA(x)2\n4\u03c14He\n\u2212 B\n\u03c12e\n.\nAssume that the minimum of concentration in a given stria-\ntion is achieved at x = 0. Let us consider such LH frequen-\ncies \u03c9 and the values of the longitudinal wave numbers kzthat, first, the coefficient A(x) is positive everywhere and, sec-\nond, at some particular point of a striation x = x0 the equal-\nity A(x0) = 2\u03c1e\n\u221a\nB takes place. It is useful to introduce the\nfunction F = A(x) \u2212 2\u03c1e\n\u221a\nB and to analyze its behavior for\ndifferent frequencies \u03c9 and the model Gaussian distribution of\nplasma in a striation\n(15)\u03b4n(x) = \u2212n0 exp\n(\u2212x2\/a2).\nIt is clear that for the frequencies \u03c9 sufficiently exceeding the\nLHR frequency (depending on the kz number) the function F\nis positive everywhere. For smaller frequencies there is a point\nx = x0 where this function goes through zero. Closer to the\ncenter 0 < x < x0 it is positive and it becomes negative at the\ndistances x > x0. For even more smaller frequencies the func-\ntion F is negative everywhere. The range of frequencies \t\u03c9\nwithin which the function F changes its sign can be estimated\nas \t\u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9LHR(N0) n02N0 . This is the frequency range for which\nthe trapping of LH waves exists (as will be shown below).\nIn order to demonstrate that the trapping indeed exists, the\nbehavior of the group velocity along the x-axis should be in-\nvestigated. The following relation between the group Vg and\nthe phase Vph velocities of LH waves along the x-axis can be\nestablished with the help of Eq. (13)\n(16)Vg\nVph\n= \u03c9\n2\nLHR\n\u03c92\n(\n\u03c12e k\n2\nx \u2212\nB\nk2x\n)\n.\nAccording to Eq. (16) the group velocity becomes equal to zero\nif |kx | = k\u2217x , where\n(17)k\u22172x =\n\u221a\nM\nm\n|kz|\n\u03c1e\n.\nIf the wave number of perturbation is large enough k2x > k\u22172x the\ngroup and the phase velocities have the same signs. For small\nwave numbers k2x < k\u22172x the group and the phase velocities have\nopposite signs. Note, that according to Eq. (14) the square root\nbecomes equal to zero exactly for kx = k\u2217x . It means that inside\nof a striation at 0 < x < x0 for one (small-scale) solution that\ncorresponds to the sign + before the root in Eq. (14) the group\nand the phase velocities have the same directions. At the same\ntime for large-scale solution (the sign minus before the root) the\ngroup and the phase velocities have opposite directions.\nIn the inner part of a striation 0 < x < x0 two solutions\n(large-scale and small-scale ones) are independent. But at the\npoint x = x0 two wave numbers become equal to each other.\nIt means that in the vicinity of this point the transformation of\nwaves takes place. To understand the behavior of waves near\nx = x0 more detailed analysis is required. Let us return to our\nbasic differential equation (11). The solution of this equation\nnear x = x0 can be obtained in the form of\n(18)\u03a60 = f (x) exp\n(\ni\n\u221a\nA(x0)\u221a\n2\u03c1e\nx\n)\n,\nwhere f (x) is a slowly varying function to be determined. After\nthe substitution of (18) into Eq. (11) we arrive at the following\napproximate equation\n(19)2A(x0)\u2202\n2f\n2 +\n(\nA2(x)\n2 \u2212 B\n)\nf = 0.\u2202x 4\u03c1e\nN. Borisov, F. Honary \/ Physics Letters A 372 (2008) 2440\u20132445 2443In the vicinity of x = x0 taking into account that A(x) is a de-\ncreasing function of the coordinate x, we may set\n(20)A2(x) = 4\u03c12eB \u2212\nx \u2212 x0\nLx\n,\nwhere Lx is the characteristic scale of inhomogeneity along the\nx-axis. After the substitution of (20) into Eq. (19) we obtain an\nequation\n(21)d\n2f\nd\u03be2\n\u2212 \u03bef = 0, where \u03be = x \u2212 x0\n(8\u03c12eLxA(x0))1\/3\n.\nEq. (21) has a well-known solution in the form of the Airy func-\ntion. For x < x0 there are two waves propagating in opposite\ndirections with equal amplitudes. At the same time the cho-\nsen solution of Eq. (21) decreases exponentially for x > x0. It\nmeans that the wave propagating in the region x \u0002 x0 towards\nx0 is reflected at this point. The requirement that the function\nf (x) varies more slowly than the exponent (see Eq. (18)) means\n(22)Lx \b \u03c1e\u221a\n2A5\/2(x0)\n.\nTaking into account Eqs. (18) and (21) we find that for x \u0002 x0\nthe potential \u03a60 describes two waves with equal signs of their\nphases velocities. For brevity we shall call these two waves the\nsmall-scale (the sigh + before the root in (14)) and the large-\nscale (the sign \u2212 before the root in (14)). It is easy to verify that\nthe phase velocities of these two waves have the same direction\n(in the positive direction of the x-axis). At the same time from\nEq. (16) it follows that the directions of the group velocities of\nthe discussed waves are opposite to each other. So, the small-\nscale wave propagating in the region x \u0002 x0 towards x = x0\nis reflected at this point with the total transformation into the\nlarge-scale wave. The latter propagates to the other reflection\npoint in a striation where A2(x) = 4\u03c12eB . In a symmetric stri-\nation this point is x = \u2212x0. As a result the trapping of such\nLH wave takes place. Hence, each given kz number determines\na restricted range of frequencies for which the trapping takes\nplace. But the reflection is only a necessary condition for the\nexistence of a stationary state. The appropriate phase relations\nare discussed in the next section.\n4. Stationary states of the trapped LH waves in striations\nLet us designate by k(+)x the wave number of the small-scale\nwave and by k(\u2212)x the wave number of the large-scale wave.\nThe stationary state of the LH wave trapped in a striation exists\nif two phase integrals between turning points x(1)0 and x\n(2)\n0 obey\nthe following relation\n(23)\nx\n(2)\n0\u222b\nx\n(1)\n0\n(\nk(+)x (x1) \u2212 k(\u2212)x (x1)\n)\ndx1 = \u03c0(2n + 1),\nwhere n is an integer. This relation means that in stationary con-\nditions the phase at a given point x\u2217 inside a striation and the\nphase acquired by the wave after propagation to the first turn-\ning point, reflection from it, propagation to the second turningpoint in the form of another wave, once more reflection, and\npropagation to the point x\u2217 deviate by 2\u03c0n (where n is an inte-\nger). Note, that in contrast with the usual case when the sum of\ntwo phase integrals between the turning points should be equal\nto \u03c0(2n + 1) in our case the difference of such phase integrals\nis equal to \u03c0(2n + 1). The reason for this is that the group and\nthe phase velocities of the large-scale wave have opposite di-\nrections.\nThe relation (23) can be fulfilled only for some particular\ndiscrete set of frequencies \u03c9n of the LH wave. To find the set\nof eigenfrequencies let us suppose that A \b \u221aA2 \u2212 4\u03c12eB . In\nsuch case the wave numbers determined by Eq.

Note that the frequency \u03c90 is larger than the LHR fre-\nquency of the ambient plasma due to thermal corrections and\nfinite longitudinal wave number kz.\nWith the help of Eqs.

Borisov, F. Honary \/ Physics Letters A 372 (2008) 2440\u20132445It is convenient to introduce a new parameter \u000bn and a new vari-\nable \u03be instead of x\n(30)\u000bn = 1 + 2N0\nn0\n\u03b4\u03c9n\n\u03c90\n\u03c92Pe\n\u03c92He\n(\n1 + \u03c9\n2\nHe\n\u03c92Pe(N0)\n)\n, \u03be = x\na\n.\nAfter the integration with respect to x in Eq.

It is clear from Eq. (28) that the turning\npoints for x \u0002 a appear only if the eigenfrequencies \u03b4\u03c9n\/\u03c90\nare negative. There is a finite set of such frequencies\n(32)\u03b4\u03c9n\n\u03c90\n\u2248 \u2212\n(\n1 \u2212 2\n\u221a\nN0\nn0\n\u03c9Pi\n\u03c90\n\u03c1e\na\n(2n + 1)\n)\nn0\n2N0\n\u03c92e\n\u03c92Pe\n.\nIt is seen that the broader and the deeper the striation is, the\nmore eigenfrequencies corresponding to the trapped LH waves\nexist in it. Taking into account the value of the averaged fre-\nquency \u03c90, we find the eigenfrequencies \u03c9n = \u03c90 + \u03b4\u03c9n in the\nform\n\u03c9n \u2248 \u03c9LHR(N0)\n[\n1 +\n\u221a\nM\nm\n\u03c1e|kz|\n(33)\u2212\n(\n1 \u2212 2\n\u221a\nN0\nn0\n\u03c9Pi\n\u03c90\n\u03c1e\na\n(2n + 1)\n)\nn0\n2N0\n\u03c92He\n\u03c92Pe\n]\n.\nIt is clearly seen from Eq. (33) that due to the longitudinal cor-\nrection (if the factor\n\u221a\nM\nm\n\u03c1e|kz| is not too small) some of the\neigenfrequencies are definitely higher than the LHR frequency\nof the background plasma \u03c9LHR(N0). At the same time there\nare eigenstates with the frequencies slightly less than \u03c9LHR(N0)\nbut still higher than the minimal LHR frequency in the center of\na striation. Estimates based on Eq. (33) show that for striation\nwith 10% depletion and a half-width a = 5 m, the amount of\ntrapped LH modes comprises nmax \u223c 10 for a given kz number.\nIt can be verified that the kx numbers of the trapped modes are\nrather large, that is the oscillations are small-scale ones. Indeed,\nit follows from Eqs. (24), (26) that for typical HF range kz num-\nbers kz \u223c (2 \u2212 4) \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22121 the characteristic sizes for LH\noscillations along the x-axis are of the order of lx \u223c 5\u201310 cm.\nIt is approximately one order of magnitude larger than the De-\nbye size. For natural plasma depletions in the upper ionosphere\nwith the relative depth n0\/N0 \u2248 (5\u201310)% and the halfwidth\na = 25 m an estimate of the amount of LH modes trapped in\na plasma cavity gives the value nmax \u2248 6\u20138 (depending on the\nmagnitude of the plasma frequency of ions).\nThe same results can be obtained if we seek for the solution\nin the form (18) with the minus sign in the exponent\n(34)\u03a60 = f (x) exp\n(\n\u2212i\n\u221a\nA(x0)\u221a\n2\u03c1e\nx\n)and in Eq. (24) we also use the minus sign before the square\nroot\n(35)k(\u00b1)x = \u2212\n\u221a\nA\n2\u03c12e\n(\n1 \u00b1\n\u221a\nA2 \u2212 4\u03c12HeB\n2A\n)\n.\nSo we have found solutions that correspond to the trapped LH\nmodes inside striations with the set of eigenfrequencies (33).\n5. Discussion and conclusion\nWe have investigated conditions for trapping of LH waves in\nartificial plasma depletions (striations) created in heating exper-\niments. It is shown that there is a restricted range of frequencies\nbelow and above the LHR frequency of the ambient plasma\nwithin which the trapping can take place. This range of fre-\nquencies depends on the longitudinal wave number kz of the\nexcited waves and the relative depletion of plasma in striations.\nThe increase of kz number provides the trapping of LH oscilla-\ntions with higher frequencies compared to the LHR frequency\nof the background plasma. In heating experiments the magni-\ntude of the longitudinal wave number for the excited LH waves\nis determined by the matching conditions between the corre-\nsponding wave numbers of the interacting UH and LH waves.\nFor typical wave numbers kz \u223c (4 \u00d7 10\u22124\u201310\u22123) cm\u22121 the\nexcited LH waves trapped in striations can have frequencies\nexceeding the LHR frequency up to \u223c (10\u201325)%. As it was\nmentioned before, trapped LH waves should have higher inten-\nsities than those propagating freely from striations. This in turn\nshould influence the magnitude of the downshifted maximum\nin the secondary stimulated emissions.\nThe obtained above results can be helpful in explanation of\nLH waves trapping in natural plasma cavities in the Earth\u2019s up-\nper ionosphere. The Freja satellite detected shallow n0\/N0 \u223c\n0.01\u20130.1 and rather broad a \u223c 20\u2013100 m plasma depletions in\nthe upper ionosphere associated with the LH waves \u201cspikelets\u201d\n[2,3]. In such depletions the drift of magnetized electrons is too\nweak to provide the trapping by the mechanism discussed in\n[4\u20136]. At the same time our approach can easily explain the\ntrapping of LH waves in such shallow cavities. Indeed, in the\nupper ionosphere the Larmour frequency of electrons \u03c9He be-\ncomes of the order or even larger than the plasma frequency\n\u03c9Pe . Due to this even in shallow depletions significant amount\nof localized eigenstates with the frequencies around the LHR\nfrequency can exist.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Leverhulme Trust Grant\nRef.
