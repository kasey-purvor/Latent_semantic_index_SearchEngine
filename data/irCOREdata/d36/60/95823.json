The new \u0085eld of judgment aggregation aims to \u0085nd collective judgments\non logically interconnected propositions. Recent impossibility results establish lim-\nitations on the possibility to vote independently on the propositions. I show that,\nfortunately, the impossibility results do not apply to a wide class of realistic agendas\nonce propositions like \u0093if a then b\u0094 are adequately modelled, namely as subjunct-\nive implications rather than material implications. For these agendas, consistent and\ncomplete collective judgments can be reached through appropriate quota rules (which\ndecide propositions using acceptance thresholds). I characterise the class of these\nquota rules. I also prove an abstract result that characterises consistent aggregation\nfor arbitrary agendas in a general logic.\nKey words: judgment aggregation, subjunctive implication, material implication,\ncharacterisation of possibility agendas\nJEL Classi\u0085cation Numbers: D70, D71, D79\n1 Introduction\nIn judgment aggregation, the objects of the group decision are not as usual (mutually\nexclusive) alternatives, but propositions representing interrelated (yes\/no) questions\nthe group faces. To ensure that these interrelations are well-de\u0085ned, propositions are\nstatements in a formal logic. As a simple example, suppose the three-member board\nof a central bank disagrees on which of the following propositions hold.\na : GDP growth will pick up.\nb : In\u0087ation will pick up.\na! b : If GDP growth will pick up then in\u0087ation will pick up.\nReaching collective beliefs is non-trivial. In Table 1, each board member holds\nconsistent (yes\/no) beliefs but the propositionwise majority beliefs are inconsistent.\nTo achieve consistent collective judgments, the group cannot use majority voting.\nWhat procedure should the group use instead? A wide-spread view is that, in this\n1This paper was presented at the Risk, Uncertainty and Decision seminar (MSE, Paris, April\n2005), the Aggregation of Opinions workshop (Yale Law School, September 2006), and the 8th Au-\ngustus de Morgan workshop (King\u0092s College London, November 2006). Benjamin Polak\u0092s extensive\ncomments and suggestions have bene\u0085ted the paper on substantive and presentational levels. I am\nalso grateful for helpful comments by two referees and by Christian List and Philippe Mongin.\n1\na a! b b\n1\/3 of the board Yes Yes Yes\n1\/3 of the board No Yes No\n1\/3 of the board Yes No No\nCollective under majority rule Yes Yes No\nCollective under premise-based rule Yes Yes Yes\nCollective under the (below-de\u0085ned) quota rule No No No\nTable 1: A simple judgment aggregation problem and three aggregation rules\nas in most other judgment aggregation problems, we must give up aggregating pro-\npositionwise2, for instance in favour of a premise-base rule (as discussed below). I\nshow that this conclusion is often an artifact of an inappropriate way to model im-\nplications like a ! b. In many judgment aggregation problems, a more appropriate\nsubjunctive interpretation of implications changes the logical relations between pro-\npositions in such a way that we can aggregate on a propositionwise basis without\ncreating collective inconsistencies. Indeed, we can use quota rules: here, separate an-\nonymous votes are taken on each proposition using (proposition-speci\u0085c) acceptance\nthresholds. Suppose for instance that the following thresholds are used: b is accepted\nif and only if a majority accepts b, and a p 2 fa; a! bg is accepted if and only if at\nleast 3\/4 of people accept p. Then, in the situation of Table 1, a, a! b and b are all\nrejected, i.e. the outcome is f:a;:(a! b);:bg.\nThe problem is that this outcome, although intuitively perfectly consistent, is\ndeclared inconsistent in classical logic, because classical logic de\u0085nes :(a ! b) as\nequivalent to a ^ :b (\u0093a and not-b\u0094), by interpreting \u0093!\u0094as a material rather than\na subjunctive implication. Is this equivalence plausible in our example? Intuitively,\na ^ :b does indeed entail :(a ! b), but :(a ! b) does not entail a ^ :b because\n:(a! b) does not intend to say anything about whether a and b are actually true or\nfalse: rather it intends to say that b would be false in the hypothetical (hence possibly\ncounterfactual) case of a\u0092s truth. Indeed, a person who believes that it is false that\na pick up in GDP growth leads to a pick up in in\u0087ation may or may not believe\nthat GDP growth or in\u0087ation will actually pick up; what he believes is rather that\nin\u0087ation will not pick up in the hypothetical case(s) that GDP growth will pick up.\nIn real-life judgment aggregation problems, implication statements usually have a\nsubjunctive meaning. It is important not to misrepresent this meaning using material\nimplications and classical logic, because this creates unnatural logical connections and\narti\u0085cial impossibilities of aggregation. The above quota rule, for instance, guarantees\ncollective consistency (not just for the pro\u0085le in Table 1) if the implication \u0093a ! b\u0094\nis subjunctive, but not if it is material. More generally, I establish the existence of\nquota rules with consistent outcomes for a large class of realistic agendas: the so-called\nimplication agendas, which contain (bi-)implications and atomic propositions. This\npossibility is created by interpreting (bi-)implications subjunctively; it disappears if\nwe instead use classical logic, i.e. interpret (bi-)implications materially. At \u0085rst sight,\nthis positive \u0085nding seems in con\u0087ict with the recent surge of impossibility results\n2That is, aggregating by voting independently on the propositions: the collective judgment on any\nproposition p depends only on how the individuals judge p, not on how they judge other propositions.\nThis property is usually called \u0093independence\u0094.\n2\non propositionwise aggregation (see below). In fact, these results presuppose logical\ninterconnections between propositions that are stronger than (or di\u00a4erent to) those\nwhich I obtain here under the subjunctive interpretation of (bi-)implications. In\nvarious results, I derive the (necessary and su\u00a2 cient) conditions that the acceptance\nthresholds of quota rules must satisfy in order to guarantee consistent outcomes.\nThese results are applications of an abstract characterisation result, Theorem 3, which\nis valid for arbitrary agendas in a general logic. It also generalises the \u0093intersection\nproperty\u0094 result by Nehring and Puppe [18, 19] (but not that by Dietrich and List\n[6]).\nAlthough I show that collective consistency is often achievable by aggregating\npropositionwise (using quota rules), I do not wish to generally advocate proposition-\nwise aggregation. In particular, one may reject propositionwise aggregation rules by\narguing that they neglect relevant information: in order to decide on b it is arguably\nnot just relevant how people judge b but also why they do so, i.e. how they judge\nb\u0092s \u0093premises\u0094a and a ! b. This naturally leads to the popular premise-based rule:\nhere, only a and a! b \u0096the \u0093premises\u0094\u0096are decided through (majority) votes, while\nb \u0096the \u0093conclusion\u0094\u0096is accepted if and only if a and a! b have been accepted; so\nthat, in the situation of Table 1, a and a! b, and hence b, are accepted.\nDespite the mentioned objection, propositionwise aggregation rules are superior\nfrom a manipulation angle: non-propositionwise aggregation rules can be manipulated\nby agenda setters (Dietrich [2]) and by voters (Dietrich and List [5]).3\nIn general, the judgment aggregation problem \u0096deciding which propositions to\naccept based on which ones the individuals accept \u0096and its formal results are open\nto di\u00a4erent interpretations of \u0093accepting\u0094 and di\u00a4erent sorts of propositions. This\npaper\u0092s examples and discussion focus on the case that \u0093accepting\u0094means \u0093believ-\ning\u0094,4 and mostly on the case that the propositions have a descriptive content (like\n\u0093GDP growth will pick up\u0094), although Section 4 touches on normative propositions\n(like \u0093peace is better than war\u0094).5\nIn the literature, judgment aggregation is discussed on a less formal basis in\nlaw (e.g. Kornhauser and Sager [12], Chapman [1]) and political philosophy (e.g.\nPettit [22]), and is formalised in List and Pettit [15] who use classical propositional\nlogic. Also the related belief merging literature in arti\u0085cial intelligence uses classical\npropositional logic to represent propositions (e.g. Konieczny and Pino-Perez [11] and\nPigozzi [23]). A series of results establish, for di\u00a4erent agendas, the impossibility of\naggregating on a propositionwise basis in accordance with collective consistency and\ndi\u00a4erent other conditions (e.g. List and Pettit [15], Pauly and van Hees [21], Dietrich\n[2, 4], G\u00e4rdenfors [10], Nehring and Puppe [20], van Hees [26], Dietrich and List [7],\nDokow and Holzman [9] and Mongin [17]). Further impossibilities (with minimal\n3Consider for instance premise-based voting in Table 1. The agenda setter may reverse the\noutcome on b by replacing the premises a and a ! b by other premises a0 and a0 ! b. Voter 2\nor 3 can reverse the outcome on b by pretending to reject both premises a and a! b.\n4Judgment aggregation is the aggregation of belief sets if \u0093accepting\u0094 means \u0093believing\u0094, the\naggregation of desire sets if \u0093accepting\u0094means \u0093desiring\u0094, the aggregation of moral judgment sets if\n\u0093accepting\u0094means \u0093considering as morally good\u0094, etc.\n5By considering beliefs on possibly normative propositions, judgment aggregation uses a broader\n\u0093belief\u0094notion than is common in economics, where beliefs usually apply to descriptive facts only.\nFor instance, standard preference aggregation problems can be modelled as judgment aggregation\nproblems by interpreting preferences as beliefs of normative propositions like \u0093x is better than y\u0094\n(see Dietrich and List [7]; also List and Pettit [16]).\n3\nagenda conditions) follow from Nehring and Puppe\u0092s [18, 19] results on strategy-\nproof social choice. To achieve possibility, propositionwise aggregation is given up\nin favour of distance-based aggregation by Pigozzi [23] (drawing on Konieczny and\nPino-Perez [11]), of sequential aggregation by List [14] and Dietrich and List [6], and\nof aggregating relevant information by Dietrich [4].\nSection 7 uses Dietrich\u0092s [3] judgment aggregation model in general logics, and\nthe other sections use for the \u0085rst time possible-worlds semantics.\n2 De\u0085nitions\nWe consider a group or persons N = f1; 2; : : : ; ng (n \u0015 2), who need collective\njudgments on a set of propositions expressed in formal logic.\nThe language. Following Dietrich\u0092s [3] general logics model, a language is given by\na non-empty set L of sentences (called propositions) closed under negation, i.e. p 2 L\nimplies :p 2 L. (Interesting languages of course have also other connectives than\nnegation :). Logical interconnections are captured either by an entailment relation \u000f\n(telling for which A \u0012 L and p 2 L we have A \u000f p) or, equivalently, by a consistency\nnotion (telling which sets A \u0012 L are consistent).6 The two notions are interde\u0085nable:\na set A \u0012 L is inconsistent if and only A \u000f p and A \u000f :p for some p 2 L; and an\nentailment A \u000f p holds if and only if A[ f:pg is inconsistent.7 The precise nature of\nlogical interconnections is addressed later. A proposition p 2 L is a contradiction if\nfpg is inconsistent, and a tautology if f:pg is inconsistent.\nAll following sections except Section 7 consider a particular language: L is the set\nof propositions constructible using : (\u0093not\u0094), ^ (\u0093and\u0094) and! (\u0093if-then\u0094) from a set\nA 6= ; of non-decomposable symbols, called atomic propositions (and representing\nsimple statements like \u0093in\u0087ation will pick up\u0094). So L is the smallest set such that (i)\nA \u0012 L and (ii) p; q 2 L implies :p 2 L, (p ^ q) 2 L and (p ! q) 2 L. The critical\nquestion, treated in the next section, is how (not) to de\u0085ne the logical interconnections\non L: while some entailments like a; b \u000f a ^ b and a; a! b \u000f b are not controversial,\nothers are. Notationally, I drop brackets when there is no ambiguity, e.g. c! (a^ b)\nstands for (c ! (a ^ b)). Further, p _ q (\u0093p or q\u0094) stands for :(:p ^ :q), and\np $ q (\u0093p if and only if q\u0094) stands for (p ! q) ^ (q ! p). For any conjunction\np = a1 ^ ::: ^ ak of one or more atomic propositions a1; :::; ak (called the conjuncts of\np), let C(p) := fa1; :::; akg (e.g. C(a) = fag and C(a ^ b) = C(b ^ a) = fa; bg).\nIn judgment aggregation, the term \u0093connection rule\u0094commonly refers to implic-\national statements like \u0093if GDP growth continues and interest rates stay below X\nthen in\u0087ation will rise\u0094. I now formalise this terminology. If each of p and q is a\nconjunction of one or more atomic propositions,\n6For the two approaches, see Dietrich [3]. Logical interconnections can be interpreted either\nsemantically or syntactically (in the latter case, the symbol \u0093`\u0094is more common than \u0093\u000f\u0094). In the\n(classical or non-classical) logics considered in Sections 3-6, I de\u0085ne interconnections semantically\n(but there are equivalent syntactic de\u0085nitions). Dropping brackets, I often write p1; :::; pk \u000f p for\nfp1; :::; pkg \u000f p.\n7The latter equivalence supposes that the logic is not paraconsistent. All logics considered in this\npaper are of this kind.\n4\n\u000f p ! q is a uni-directional connection rule, called non-degenerate if C(q)nC\n(p) 6= ;, i.e. if p! q is not a tautology (under the classical or the non-classical\nentailment relation discussed later);\n\u000f p $ q is a bi-directional connection rule, called non-degenerate if C(q)nC(p)\n6= ; and C(p)nC(q) 6= ;, i.e. if neither p! q nor q ! p is a tautology.\nA uni- or bi-directional connection rule is simply called a connection rule.\nThe agenda. The agenda is the set of propositions on which decisions are needed.\nFormally, it is a non-empty set X \u0012 L of the form X = fp;:p : p 2 X+g for\nsome set X+ containing no negated proposition :q. In the introductory example,\nX+ = fa; b; a ! bg. Notationally, double-negations cancel each other out: if p 2 X\nis a negated proposition :q then hereafter when I write \u0093:p\u0094I mean q rather than\n::q. (This ensures that :p 2 X.)\nAn agendaX (in the language L just de\u0085ned) is an implication agenda if X+\nconsists of non-degenerate connection rules and the atomic propositions occurring in\nthem; it is called simple if all its connection rules are uni-directional ones p ! q in\nwhich p and q are atomic propositions.\nMany standard examples of judgment aggregation problems can be modelled with\nimplication agendas. The atomic propositions represent (controversial) issues, and\nconnection rules represent (controversial) links between issues. Any accepted connec-\ntion rule establishes a constraint on how to decide the issues.\nb\na\n(1) X + = {a, b,\na \u00ae b}\nb\na\n(2) X + = {a, b,\na \u00ab b}\n(3) X + = {a, b, c,\nc \u00ab (a \u00d9 b)}\nc\nba\n(4) X + = {a, b, c, a \u00ae b\nc \u00ab a, a \u00ae (b \u00d9 c)}\nb c\na\na b\nd c\nb\nc\na\n(5) X + = {a, b, c, d, e,\na \u00ae b, b \u00ae c, d \u00ae e}\n(6) X + = {a, b, c, d, a \u00ae b,\nb \u00ae c, c \u00ae d, d \u00ae a}\nb c\na\n(7) X + = {a, b, c, a \u00ae b, b \u00ae a,\nb \u00ae c, c \u00ae b, c \u00ae a, a \u00ae c}\ne\nd\nFigure 1: Seven implication agendas, represented as networks.\nImplication agendas can always be represented graphically as networks over its\natomic propositions.8 Figure 1 shows seven implication agendas, of which (1) and\n8Nodes contain atomic propositions. Arrows represent connection rules: bi-directional arrows\nindicate bi-implications, and bifurcations indicate conjunctions of more than one atomic proposition.\n5\n(5)-(7) are simple. Agenda (1) represents our central bank example. An environ-\nmental expert commission might face the agenda (2), where a is \u0093global warming will\ncontinue\u0094and b is \u0093the ozone hole exceeds size X\u0094. The judges of a legal court face, in\nthe decision problem from which judgment aggregation originated, an agenda of type\n(3), where a is \u0093the defendant has broken the contract\u0094, b is \u0093the contract is legally\nvalid\u0094, c is \u0093the defendant is liable\u0094, and c $ (a ^ b) is a claim on what constitutes\n(necessary and su\u00a2 cient) conditions of liability.9 A company board trying to predict\nthe price policy of three rival \u0085rms A-C might face the agenda (3) or (4) or (7), where\na is \u0093Firm A will raise prices\u0094, b is \u0093Firm B will raise prices\u0094, and c is \u0093Firm C will\nraise prices\u0094. The three agendas di\u00a4er in the type of connections between a; b; c\ndeemed possible.\nIn Section 4, I discuss two types of decision problems captured by implication\nagendas: reaching judgments on facts and their causal relations, and reaching judg-\nments on hypotheses and their justi\u0085cational\/evidential relations.\nBut not all realistic judgment aggregation problems are formalisable by implic-\nation agendas. Some judgment aggregation problems involve a generalised kind of\nimplication agenda, obtained by generalising the de\u0085nition of connection rules so as\nto include (bi-)implications between propositions p and q other than conjunctions of\natomic propositions.10 More radical departures from implication agendas include: (i)\nthe agenda given by X+ = fa; b; a ^ bg, which contains no connection rule but the\nBoolean expression a^ b; (ii) the agenda representing a preference aggregation prob-\nlem, which contains propositions of the form xRy from a predicate logic (see Section\n7); (iii) agendas where X+ contains only atomic propositions, between which certain\nconnection rules are imposed exogenously (rather than subjected to a decision).\nJudgment sets. A judgment set (held by a person or the group) is a subset A \u0012 X;\np 2 A stands for \u0093the person\/group accepts proposition p\u0094. A judgment set A can\nbe more or less rational. Ideally, it should be both complete, i.e. contain at least one\nmember of each pair p;:p 2 X, and (logically) consistent. A is weakly consistent if A\ndoes not contain a pair p;:p 2 X (i.e., intuitively, ifA is not \u0093obviously inconsistent\u0094).\nFor agenda (1) in Figure 1, fa; a ! b;:bg is complete, weakly consistent, but not\nconsistent because A entails b (in fact, fa; a! bg entails b) and A entails :b (in fact,\ncontains :b). So to say, \u0093weak consistency\u0094means not to contain a contradiction\np;:p, and consistency means not to entail one.\nAggregation rules. A pro\u0085le is an n-tuple (A1; : : : ; An) of (individual) judg-\nment sets Ai \u0012 X. A (judgment) aggregation rule is a function F that maps\neach pro\u0085le (A1; : : : ; An) from a given domain of pro\u0085les to a (group) judgment set\nF (A1; : : : ; An) = A \u0012 X. The domain of F is universal if it consists of all pro\u0085les of\ncomplete and consistent judgment sets. F is complete\/consistent\/weakly consistent if\nF generates a complete\/consistent\/weakly consistent judgment set for each pro\u0085le in\n9A doctrinal paradox arises if there is a majority for a, a majority for b, a unanimity for c$ (a^b),\nbut a majorty for :c.\n10 If, for instance, p and q were allowed to be dis junctions of atomic propositions then a! (b _ c)\nwould count as a connection rule, so that X+ = fa; b; c; (a _ b) ! cg would de\u0085ne an implication\nagenda of the so-generalised kind. Generalised implication agendas may well be relevant as groups\nmay need to make up their mind on generalised types of connection rules. The possibility of consistent\naggregation by quota rules may disappear for such agendas. So our subjunctive reading of (bi-\n)implications (see Section 3) is not a general recipe for possibility in judgment aggregation.\n6\nits domain. On the universal domain, majority rule (given by F (A1; :::; An) = fp 2\nX : more persons i have p 2 Ai than p =2 Aig) is weakly consistent, and a dictatorial\nrule (given by F (A1; :::; An) = Aj for a \u0085xed j) is even consistent. We will focus on\nquota rules thus de\u0085ned. To each family (mp)p2X+ of numbers in f1; :::; ng, the quota\nrule with thresholds (mp)p2X+ is the aggregation rule with universal domain given by\nF(mp)p2X+ (A1; :::; An) = fp 2 X : at least mp persons i have p 2 Aig,\nwhere m:p := n\u0000mp + 1 for all p 2 X+ to ensure exactly one member of each pair\np;:p 2 X is accepted, i.e. that quota rules are complete and weakly consistent.\nSo each family of thresholds (mp)p2X+ in f1; :::; ng generates a quota rule. As\none easily checks, an aggregation rule is a quota rule if and only if it has universal\ndomain and is complete, weakly consistent, independent, anonymous, monotonic, and\nresponsive.11 The important property missing here is consistency. We will investigate\nif and how the thresholds can be chosen so as to achieve consistency. The properties of\nindependence and monotonicity are equivalent to strategy-proofness if each individual\ni holds epistemic preferences, i.e. would like the group to hold beliefs close to Ai, the\nset of propositions i considers true.12\n3 A non-classical logic\nHow should we de\u0085ne the logical interconnections within the language L speci\u0085ed in\nSection 2? Although classical logic gets some entailments right (like a; a! b \u000f b), its\ntreatment of connection rules is inappropriate, or so I will argue.\nRequirements on the representation of connection rules. To re\u0087ect the in-\ntended meaning of connection rules such as a! b; c$ a; a! (b^c), the logic should\nrespect the following conditions.\n(a) The acceptance of a connection rule r establishes exactly the intended logical\nconstraints on atomic propositions, i.e. r is consistent with the \u0093right\u0094sets of\natomic and negated atomic propositions. For instance, a ! b is inconsistent\nwith fa;:bg but consistent with each of fa; bg; f:a; bg; f:a;:bg.\n11 Independence : for all p 2 X and all admissible pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An); (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n), if fi :\np 2 Aig = fi : p 2 A\u0003i ) then p 2 F (A1; :::; An) , p 2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n). Anonymity :\nF (A1; :::; An) = F (A\u0019(1); :::; A\u0019(n)) for all admissible pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An), (A\u0019(1); :::; A\u0019(n)), where\n\u0019 : N 7! N is any permutation. Monotonicity : for all individuals i and admissible pro\u0085les\n(A1; :::; An); (A1; :::; A\n\u0003\ni ; :::; An) di\u00a4ering only in i\u0092s judgment set, if F (A1; :::; An) = A\n\u0003\ni then\nF (A1; :::; A\n\u0003\ni ; :::; An) = A\n\u0003\ni . Responsiveness : for all p 2 X (such that neither p nor :p is a tautology)\nthere are admissible pro\u0085les (A1; :::; An), (A\u00031; :::; A\n\u0003\nn) with p 2 F (A1; :::; An) and p =2 F (A\u00031; :::; A\u0003n).\nClearly, quota rules satisfy all seven axioms. Conversely, independence and anonymity imply that the\ngroup judgment on any given p 2 X depends only on the number np := jfi : p 2 Aigj. This depend-\nence is positive by monotonicity, hence described by an acceptance threshold mp 2 f0; 1; :::; n + 1g.\nIf p and :p are not tautologies, mp is by responsiveness not 0 and not n+1, i.e. mp 2 f1; :::; ng; and\nm:p = n\u0000mp + 1 by completeness and weak consistency. If p or :p is a tautology, we may assume\nw.l.o.g. that, again, mp 2 f1; :::; ng and m:p = n\u0000mp + 1.\n12That is, i weakly prefers the group to hold judgment set A over judgment set B if for all p 2 X\non which Ai agrees with B, Ai also agrees with A. This condition only partly \u0085xes i\u0092s preferences,\nbut it for instance implies that i most prefers i\u0092s own judgment set Ai. See Dietrich and List [5].\n7\n(b) The negation of a (non-degenerate) connection rule r does not constrain atomic\npropositions, i.e. :r is consistent with each (consistent) set of atomic and\nnegated atomic propositions. For instance, :(a! b) is consistent with each of\nfa; bg, fa;:bg; f:a; bg; f:a;:bg.\nTo illustrate (b), consider again the central bank example, where a is \u0093GDP\ngrowth will pick up\u0094and b is \u0093in\u0087ation will pick up\u0094. Consider a board member who\nbelieves that :(a ! b), i.e. that rising GDP does not imply rising in\u0087ation. This\nbelief is intuitively perfectly consistent with any beliefs on a and b, i.e. on whether\nGDP will grow and whether in\u0087ation will rise.\nThe failure of the material implication. Material (bi-)implications (used in\nclassical logic) satisfy (a) but not (b). Consider a! b. Interpreted materially, a! b\nis equivalent to :a _ b (not-a or b), and :(a! b) to a ^ :b (a and not-b); so:\n\u000f (a) holds because a! b is inconsistent with fa;:bg (as desired) and consistent\nwith each of fa; bg; f:a; bg; f:a;:bg (as desired);\n\u000f (b) is violated because :(a! b), far from imposing no constraints, is inconsist-\nent with all sets containing :a or containing b.\nIt is well-known that the material interpretation misrepresents the intended mean-\ning of most conditional statements in common language. The (in common language\nclearly false) statement \u0093if the sun stops shining then we burn\u0094 is true materially\nbecause the sun does not stop shining. The material interpretation clashes with intu-\nition because, in common language, \u0093if a then b\u0094is not a statement about the actual\nworld, but about whether b holds in hypothetical world(s) where a holds, e.g. worlds\nwhere the sun stops shining. \u0093If a then b\u0094thus means \u0093if a were true ceteris paribus,\nthen b would be true\u0094, not \u0093a is false or b is true\u0094.\nA conditional logic. A subjunctive reading of \u0093!\u0094, where the truth value of\na! b depends on b\u0092s truth value in possibly non-actual worlds, has been formalised\nusing possible-worlds semantics, and more speci\u0085cally using conditional logic which\noriginated from Stalnaker [25] and D. Lewis [13] and is now well-established in non-\nclassical logic. I use a standard version of conditional logic, sometimes denoted C+\n(other versions could also be used). For further reference, e.g. Priest [24].\nFor comparison, recall that in classical logic (not in C+) A \u0012 L entails p 2 L\nif and only if every classical interpretation that makes all q 2 A true makes p true,\nwhere a classical interpretation is simply a (\u0093truth\u0094) function v : L ! fT; Fg that\nassigns to each proposition a truth value such that, for all p; q 2 L,\n\u000f v(:p) = T if and only if v(p) = F ,\n\u000f v(p ^ q) = T if and only if v(p) = T and v(q) = T ,\n\u000f v(p! q) = T if and only if v(p) = F or v(q) = T (material implication).\nThis leads to counter-intuitive entailments like :a \u000f a ! b and b \u000f a ! b, the\nso-called paradoxes of material implication. In response, the notion of an \u0093interpret-\nation\u0094must be rede\u0085ned. A C+-interpretation consists of\n\u000f a non-empty set W of (possible) worlds w;\n8\n\u000f for every proposition p 2 L a function fp : W ! P(W ) (fp(w) contains the\nworlds to which \u0093if p were true\u0094refers, i.e. the worlds \u0093similar\u0094to w and with\ntrue p);\n\u000f for every world w 2 W a (\u0093truth\u0094) function vw : L ! fT; Fg (that tells what\npropositions hold in w).\nset of worlds W\nw\u2019 (world similar to\nw, but with true p)\nfunction fp\n(\u201cif p were true\u201d)\nw (actual world)\nFigure 2: Referring to a non-actual world, in a C+-interpretation\nBut not any such triple (W; (fp); (vw)) \u0011 (W; (fp)p2L; (vw)w2W ) may reasonably\ncount as an interpretation: indeed, the meaning of the functions fp and vw suggests\nrequiring additional properties. Speci\u0085cally, such a triple (W; (fp); (vw)) is de\u0085ned as\na (C+-)interpretation if, for all worlds w 2W and all propositions p; q 2 L,\n\u000f vw(:p) = T if and only if vw(p) = F (like in classical logic),\n\u000f vw(p ^ q) = T if and only if vw(p) = T and vw(q) = T (like in classical logic),\n\u000f vw(p! q) = T if and only if vw0(q) = T for all worlds w0 2 fp(w) (subjunctive\nimplication),\n\u000f if w0 2 fp(w) then vw0(p) = T (i.e. p holds in the worlds to which \u0093if p were\ntrue\u0094refers),\n\u000f if vw(p) = T then w 2 fp(w) (i.e. if p already holds in w then \u0093if p were true\u0094\nrefers to w).\nThe truth condition for p! q (third bullet point) captures the intuitive meaning\nof implications. \u0093If the sun stops shining then we burn\u0094is false in our world: we do\nnot burn in worlds similar to ours but without the sun shining.\nBy de\u0085nition, A \u0012 L (C+-)entails p 2 L (A \u000f p) if, for all interpretations\n(W; (fp); (vw)) and all worlds w 2 W , if all q 2 A hold in w then p holds in w (i.e. p\nholds \u0093whenever\u0094all q 2 A hold). For instance, a; b; (a ^ b)! c \u000f c; but :a 2 a! b\nand b 2 a! b (so C+ does not su\u00a4er the paradoxes of material implication). Recall\nthat A \u0012 L is consistent if and only if there is no p 2 L with A \u000f p and A \u000f :p. So\n\u000f A is (C+-)consistent if and only if there is an interpretation (W; (fp); (vw)) and a\nworld w 2W in which all q 2 A hold (i.e. all q 2 A \u0093can\u0094hold simultaneously).\nSo fa;:ag is inconsistent: if a holds in a word w, :a is false in w. And fa;:(a!\nb); bg is consistent (but classically inconsistent): let a and b both hold in w and let\nfa(w) contain a world w0 in which b is false.13\n13This is an example of why C+ meets our requirement (b) on the treatment of connection rules.\nTo verify (b) in general, apply Lemma 8 to sets A consisting of negated non-degenerate connection\nrules and of atomic or negated atomic propositions (and note that (20) does not hold since A\\R = ;).\n9\n4 Simple implication agendas\nGiven the logic C+, which quota rules are consistent? I \u0085rst give an answer for simple\nimplication agendas.\nTheorem 1 A quota rule F(mp)p2X+ for a simple implication agenda X is consistent\nif and only if\nmb \u0014 ma +ma!b \u0000 n for all a! b 2 X. (1)\nSo consistent quota rules do exist: putting mp = n for all p 2 X+ validates (1).\nBut this extreme quota rule is far from the only consistent quota rule; for instance,\n(1) holds if all atomic propositions a 2 X get the same threshold ma (so all issues\nare treated symmetrically) and all connection rules a ! b 2 X get the unanimity\nthreshold ma!b = n (so links between issues are very hard to accept).\nSome consequences of (1) can be expressed in terms of the network structure of\nthe (simple) implication agenda X (see Figure 1 for examples of network structures).\nThe nodes are the atomic propositions in X, and if a ! b 2 X then a is a parent\nof b and b a child of a. The notions of ancestor and descendant follow by transitive\nclosure. By (1), ma \u0015 mb if a is a parent, or more generally an ancestor, of b. In\nparticular, ma = mb if a and b are in a cycle, i.e. are ancestors of each other. In\nshort, thresholds of atomic propositions weakly decrease along (descending) paths,\nand are constant within cycles. Cycles severely restrict the thresholds not only of its\nmember propositions but also of the connection rules a ! b linking them: we must\nhave ma!b = n, as is seen by setting ma = mb in (1).\nThe picture changes radically if we misrepresent the decision problem by using\nclassical logic: then there exists at most one and typically no consistent quota rule\nF(mp)p2X+ , where \u0093consistent\u0094now means classically consistent and the (universal)\ndomain of F(mp)p2X+ now consists of the pro\u0085les of complete and classically consist-\nent judgment sets.14 More precisely, the classical counterpart of Theorem 1 is the\nfollowing result.\nTheorem 1* De\u0085ning logical interconnections using classical logic, a quota rule\nF(mp)p2X+ for a simple implication agenda X is consistent if and only if\nma = n and ma!b = mb = 1 for all a! b 2 X. (2)\nSo there is no classically consistent quota rule ifX contains a \u0093chain\u0094a! b; b! c;\nand there is a single (unnatural) one otherwise.\nEach of the two theorems can be proven in two steps: step 1 identi\u0085es possible\ntypes\/sources of inconsistency, and step 2 shows that (1) (respectively, (2)) is neces-\nsary and su\u00a2 cient to prevent these types of inconsistency.\nMore precisely, Theorem 1 follows from the following two lemmas (steps) by noting\nthat any collective judgment set A \u0012 X generated by a quota rule satis\u0085es:\nA contains exactly one member of each pair p;:p 2 X. (3)\n14Within a simple implication agenda X, the classical logical interconnections are stronger than\nthe C+ ones: all classically consistent sets A \u0012 X are C+-consistent but not vice versa (see Lemmas\n1, 2). So a consistent quoto rule\u0092s (universal) domain and co-domain shrink by moving to classical\nlogic.\n10\nLemma 1 For a simple implication agenda X, a set A \u0012 X satisfying (3) is con-\nsistent if and only if it contains no triple a; a! b;:b 2 X.\nLemma 2 For a simple implication agenda X, a quota rule F(mp)p2X+ never accepts\nany triple a; a! b;:b 2 X if and only if (1) holds.15\nAnalogously, Theorem 1* follows from the following two lemmas (steps).\nLemma 1* For a simple implication agenda X, a set A \u0012 X satisfying (3) is\nclassically consistent if and only if it contains no triple a; a ! b;:b 2 X or pair\nb;:(a! b) 2 X or pair :a;:(a! b) 2 X.\nLemma 2* For a simple implication agenda with the logical interconnections of clas-\nsical logic, a quota rule F(mp)p2X+ never accepts any triple a; a ! b;:b 2 X or pair\nb;:(a! b) 2 X or pair :a;:(a! b) 2 X if and only if (2) holds.\nLemmas 1 and 1* highlight the di\u00a4erence between non-classical and classical lo-\ngic: the latter creates two additional types of inconsistency (in simple implication\nagendas). These additional inconsistencies are arti\u0085cial; e.g. b is intuitively con-\nsistent with :(a ! b). By Lemma 2, (1) is necessary and su\u00a2 cient to exclude all\nnon-classical inconsistencies a; a ! b;:b 2 X. But (1) does nothing to prevent the\narti\u0085cial classical inconsistencies.16 To prevent also these, (1) must be strengthened\nto (2) by Lemma 2*.\nI \u0085rst prove Lemmas 1 and 1*, in reverse order to start simple.\nProof Lemma 1*. LetX andA be as speci\u0085ed. Clearly, ifA contains a triple a; a!\nb;:b or pair b;:(a! b) or pair :a;:(a! b), then A is classically inconsistent. Now\nsuppose A does not contain such a triple or pair. To show A\u0092s classical consistency,\nI de\u0085ne a classical interpretation v : L ! fT; Fg that a\u00a2 rms all p 2 A. De\u0085ne v by\nthe condition that the only true atomic propositions are those in A. Then all atomic\nor negated atomic members of A are true. Further, every a ! b 2 A is true: as A\ndoes not contain the triple a; a ! b;:b, A either contains b, in which case b is true,\nhence a ! b is true; or A contains :a, in which case a is false, hence a ! b is true.\nFinally, every :(a ! b) 2 A is true: as A contains neither the pair b;:(a ! b) nor\nthe pair :a;:(a! b), A contains neither b nor :a, so that b is false and a true, and\nhence a! b is false, i.e. :(a! b) is true.\nProof of Lemma 1. Let X and A \u0012 X be as speci\u0085ed. If A \u0012 X contains a\ntriple a; a! b;:b, A is of course (C+-)inconsistent. Now assume A contains no triple\na; a ! b;:b. To show that A is consistent (though perhaps classically inconsistent),\nI specify a C+-interpretation (W; (fp); (vw)) with a world \u0016w 2 W in which all p 2 A\nhold. Let W contain:\n(a) a world \u0016w, in which an atomic proposition a holds if and only if a 2 A;\n(b) for every atomic proposition a, a world wa (6= \u0016w) such that\n15\u0093Never\u0094of course means \u0093for no pro\u0085le in the (universal) domain of F(mp)p2X+\u0094.\n16For instance, the pair b;:(a ! b) 2 X is collectively accepted if mb < ma!b (which (1) allows)\nand if mb persons accept the pair b; a! b and all others accept the pair :b;:(a! b).\n11\n\u000f fa( \u0016w) = fwag if a =2 A and fa( \u0016w) = f \u0016w;wag if a 2 A (so \u0093if a were true\u0094refers\nto wa, and as required by the notion of a C+-interpretation also to the actual\nworld \u0016w if a holds there, i.e. if a 2 A);\n\u000f in wa exactly those atomic propositions b are false for which :(a! b) 2 A.\nWe have to convince ourselves that all p 2 A hold in \u0016w. All atomic or negated\natomic p 2 A hold in \u0016w by (a). Also any negated implication :(a ! b) 2 A holds\nin \u0016w: by (b), \u0093if a were true\u0094refers to wa, in which b is false; whence in \u0016w a ! b is\nfalse, i.e. :(a! b) true. Finally, suppose a! b 2 A. I have to show that b holds in\nall worlds w 2 fa( \u0016w). There are two cases.\nCase 1 : a 2 A. Then fa( \u0016w) = f \u0016w;wag by (b). First, b holds in \u0016w: otherwise b =2 A\n(by (a)), so that A would contain the triple a; a ! b;:b, a contradiction. Second, b\nholds in wa: otherwise :(a! b) 2 A (by (b)), contradicting a! b 2 A.\nCase 2 : a =2 A. Then fa( \u0016w) = fwag; and b holds in wa, as just mentioned. \u0004\nI now show Lemmas 2 and 2*, completing the proof of Theorems 1 and 1*.\nProof of Lemma 2. Let F(mp)p2X+ be a quota rule for a simple implication agenda\nX. Take a given triple a; a! b;:b 2 X. I consider all pro\u0085les for which a and a! b\nare collectively accepted, and I show that b is collectively accepted (i.e. :b rejected)\nfor all such pro\u0085les if and only if mb \u0014 ma +ma!b \u0000 n.\nNote \u0085rst that in all such pro\u0085les at least ma people accept a and at least ma!b\npeople accept a ! b; hence the number of people accepting both these propositions\n(hence also b) is at least ma +ma!b \u0000 n (in fact, at least maxfma +ma!b \u0000 n; 0g).\nThus, if mb \u0014 ma+ma!b\u0000n, b is in all such pro\u0085les accepted by at least mb people,\nhence collectively accepted.\nFor the converse, note that among such pro\u0085les there is one such that exactly\nmaxfma +ma!b \u0000 n; 0g people accept both a and a! b (hence b) and such that no\none else accepts b. If mb > ma +ma!b \u0000 n, then in this pro\u0085le less than mb people\naccept b, so that b is collectively rejected. \u0004\nProof of Lemma 2*. Let F(mp)p2X+ be a quota rule for a simple implication agenda\nX, with the classical logical interconnections. Lemma 2 (and its proof) also holds\nunder classical logic; so F(mp)p2X+ never accepts any triple a; a ! b;:b 2 X if and\nonly if (1) holds. Further, a given pair b;:(a! b) 2 X is never accepted if and only\nif mb \u0015 ma!b: necessity of mb \u0015 ma!b follows from footnote 16, and su\u00a2 ciency holds\nbecause, as b classically entails a! b, a! b is (in any pro\u0085le) accepted by at least as\nmany people as b. By an analogous argument, a given pair :a;:(a! b) 2 X is never\naccepted if and only if ma!b \u0014 n\u0000ma+1 (= m:a). In summary, we thus have three\ninequalities for every a ! b 2 X: that in (1), mb \u0015 ma!b, and ma!b \u0014 n\u0000ma + 1.\nTogether these inequalities are equivalent to the condition in (2), as is easily checked.\n\u0004\nConstructing consistent quota rules. I now discuss how to choose thresholds\n(mp)p2X+ that satisfy (1), for a simple implication agenda X. The notions of a\nchild\/parent and a descendant\/ancestor are de\u0085ned above. A path is a sequence\n(a1; a2; :::; ak) in X (k \u0015 2) in which each aj is a parent of aj+1 (j < k). X is acyclic\nif it has no cycle, i.e. no path (a1; :::; ak) with a1 = ak. The depth of X is dX := supfk\n12\n: there is a path in X of length kg, and the level of an atomic proposition a 2 X is\nla := supfk : there is a path in X of length k ending with ag, interpreted as 1 if no\npath ends with a. So a 2 X has level 1 if it has no parents, level 2 if it has parents\nall of which have level 1, etc. Figure 3 shows an acyclic simple implication agenda\nwith three levels.\nba c d e flevel 1:\nh i jlevel 2:\nk l mlevel 3:\ng\nFigure 3: An acyclic simple implication agenda X of depth dX = 3.\nHow free are we in choosing the thresholds (mp)p2X+? Clearly, by (1) the\nthresholds of atomic propositions must weakly decrease along any path. If X is\nacyclic and \u0085nite (hence of \u0085nite depth dX), (mp)p2X+ can be chosen recursively in\nthe following dX steps.\nStep l (= 1; 2; :::; dX): for all b 2 X of level l, choose a threshold mb 2 f1; :::; ng and\nthresholds ma!b 2 f1; :::; ng for the parents a of b, such that\nmb \u0014 ma +ma!b \u0000 n for all parents a of b. (4)\nBut this procedure may involve choosing many thresholds: in Figure 3, those of\n13 atomic propositions and 13 implications! To reduce complexity, one might use\n\u000f the same threshold m = ma!b for all connection rules a ! b 2 X, where m\nre\u0087ects how easily the group imposes constraints between issues,\n\u000f the same threshold ml for all propositions in X with the same level l (2\nf1; :::; dXg), where ml re\u0087ects how easily the group accepts level l propositions.\nI write such a quota rule as Fm;m1;:::;mdK . Here, only dX + 1 parameters must be\nchosen, e.g., in Figure 3, 3 + 1 = 4 parameters instead of 26. Applied to quota rules\nof this type, Theorem 1 yields the following characterisation, by a proof left to the\nreader.\nCorollary 1 For a \u0085nite acyclic simple implication agenda X, a quota rule Fm;m1;:::;mdK\nis consistent if and only if\nml \u0014 ml\u00001 +m\u0000 n for all levels l 2 f2; :::; dXg. (5)\nConsistent quota rules of type Fm;m1;:::;mdK can be constructed as follows.\nStep 0: choose m 2 f1; :::; ng such that (i) m \u0015 n\u0000 (n\u0000 1)=(dX \u0000 1).\nStep l (= 1; 2; :::; dX): choose ml 2 f1; :::; ng such that (ii) ml \u0015 1+(dX \u0000 l)(n\u0000m)\nand (iii) ml \u0014 ml\u00001 +m\u0000 n if l > 1.\n13\nThe conditions (i)-(iii) follow from Corollary 1: (iii) is obvious, and (i) and (ii)\nmake the choices in future steps possible.17 For a group of size n = 10 and the agenda\nof Figure 3, a consistent quota rule Fm;m1;m2;m3 might be chosen as follows.\nStep 0: m = 8 (note that 8 \u0015 n\u0000 (n\u0000 1)=(dX \u0000 1) = 10\u0000 9=2 = 5:5).\nStep 1: m1 = 8 (note that 8 \u0015 1 + (dX \u0000 1)(n\u0000m) = 1 + 2\u0002 2 = 5).\nStep 2: m2 = 6 (note that 6 \u0015 1+(dX\u00002)(n\u0000m) = 1+2 = 3 and 6 \u0014 m1+m\u0000n =\n8 + 8\u0000 10 = 6).\nStep 3: m3 = 4 (note that 4 \u0015 1 + (dX \u0000 3)(n \u0000m) = 1 and 4 \u0014 m2 +m \u0000 n =\n6 + 8\u0000 10 = 4).\nCausal and justi\u0085cational interpretation. I now o\u00a4er two interpretations of\nconnection rules, and hence of the kind of decision problems captured by implication\nagendas. For simplicity, I restrict myself to a simple implication agendas X.\nFirst, suppose implications a ! b 2 X have a causal status: a ! b means that\nfact a causes fact b. So X might contain \u0093if the ozone hole has size X then global\nwarming will continue\u0094and \u0093if global warming will continue then species Y will die\nout\u0094. Then X captures a decision problem of forming beliefs about facts and their\ncausal links. A path (a1; :::; ak) in X is a causal chain (assuming the causal links\na1 ! a2; :::; ak\u00001 ! ak hold), and the level of a proposition indicates how \u0093causally\nfundamental\u0094 it is. By an earlier remark, Theorem 1 implies that the acceptance\nthreshold must weakly decrease along any causal chain.\nSecond, suppose the implications a ! b 2 X have a justi\u0085cational (or evidential\nor indicative) status: a! b means that a indicates b (a can indicate b without causing\nb: a wet street indicates rain without causing it). So X captures a decision problem\nof forming beliefs about claims\/statements\/hypotheses and their justi\u0085cational links.\nSome claims may have a normative content, like \u0093a multi-cultural society is desir-\nable\u0094 or \u0093option x is better than option y\u0094. For instance, an environmental panel\nmight decide on a : \u0093the ozone hole has size larger than X\u0094, b : \u0093tax T on kerosine\nshould be introduced\u0094, and the justi\u0085cational link a ! b. A path (a1; :::; ak) is an\n\u0093argumentative\u0094chain (assuming the links a1 ! a2; :::; ak\u00001 ! ak hold), and the level\nof a proposition re\u0087ects how \u0093argumentatively fundamental\u0094 it is. Often, high level\npropositions are more concrete and might state that certain collective acts should\nbe taken (a road should be built, a \u0085rm downsized, a law amended, etc.), whereas\ntheir ancestors describe potential reasons or arguments, either of a descriptive kind\n(tra\u00a2 c will increase, demand will fall, etc.) or of a normative kind (multi-culturalism\nis desirable, etc.). Of course, one may reject a reason a 2 X, or reject a\u0092s status as\nreason for b 2 X (i.e. reject a! b). Again, reasons need at least as high acceptance\nthresholds as their (argumentative) descendents, e.g. 34n versus\n1\n2n.\n5 Other special implication agendas\nThe di\u00a4erence between using non-classical and using classical logic is now further\nillustrated by considering two other types of implication agendas X, namely\n17For instance, without (i) there would be no choices of m1; :::;mdX satisfying (5).\n14\n\u000f semi-simple ones: here all connection rules in X are implications p! b in which\nb is atomic (such as (a ^ c)! b but not a! (b ^ c));\n\u000f bi-simple ones: here all connection rules in X are bi-implications a$ b in which\na and b are atomic.\nFor each of these agenda types, we again perform two steps (analogous to the\nsteps performed for simple implication agendas):\n(step 1) we identify possible types\/sources of inconsistency in the agenda;\n(step 2) we exclude each one by an inequality on thresholds and if possible we\nsimplify the system of inequalities.\nThis gives a consistency condition for quota rules F(mp)p2X+ , in analogy to The-\norem 1. Again, using instead classical logic leads in step 1 to additional (arti\u0085cial)\ntypes of inconsistency; so that, in analogy to Theorem 1*, at most one (degenerate)\nquota rule F(mp)p2X+ is classically consistent (if X is semi-simple), or even no one (if\nX is bi-simple). Table 2 summarises the results for each agenda type\nAgenda\ntype\nA set A \u0012 X satisfying (3) is consistent\ni\u00a4 it has no subset of type(s)...\nF(mp)p2X+ is\nconsistent i\u00a4 ...\nsimple\nfa; a! b;:bg\nin CL also: fb;:(a! b)g; f:a;:(a! b)g\n(1)\nin CL: (2)\nsemi-simple\nC(p) [ fp! b;:bg\nin CL also: fb;:(p! b)g; f:a;:(p! b)g (a 2 C(p))\n(7)\nin CL: (8)\nbi-simple\nfa;:b; a$ bg; f:a; b; a$ bg; fa$ b;:(b$ agg\nin CL also: fa; b;:(a$ b)g; f:a;:b;:(a$ b)g\n(9)\nin CL: never\nTable 2: Three types of implication agendas X, their types of inconsistencies, and\ntheir consistent quota rules; in non-classical logic and in classical logic (\u0093CL\u0094)\nIn Table 2, the results for simple X were shown in the last section. Regarding\nsemi- or bi-simple X, we have to adapt Lemmas 1 and 2 (or 1* and 2* for classical\nlogic). Let me brie\u0087y indicate how this works. First a general remark. The types of\ninconsistency in step 1 can be (and are in Table 2) identi\u0085ed with certain inconsistent\nsets Y \u0012 X (which are minimal inconsistent, in fact irreducible; see Section 7); and\nthe inequality needed in step 2 to exclude Y \u0092s acceptance can always be written asX\np2Y\n(n\u0000mp) < n, or equivalently\nX\np2Y\nmp > n(jY j \u0000 1) (6)\n(see Lemma 5 in Section 7). Intuitively, (6) requires the propositions in Y to have\nsu\u00a2 ciently high acceptance thresholds to prevent joint acceptance of all p 2 Y .\nFirst let X be semi-simple. In step 1 we have to consider not only inconsistent\nsets of type fa; a ! b;:bg \u0012 X (as for simple X) but also ones like fa; c; (a ^ c) !\nb;:bg \u0012 X. By adapting Lemma 1 to semi-simple agendas, the inconsistent sets\nin step 1 turn out to be precisely the sets C(p) [ fp ! b;:bg \u0012 X. In the proof\nof Lemma 1, the C+-interpretation (W; (fp); (vw)) should be adapted by letting W\ncontain:\n(a) a world \u0016w, in which an atomic proposition a holds i\u00a4 a 2 A (as before)\n15\n(b) for any conjunction p of atomic propositions a world wp (6= \u0016w) such that\n\u000f fp( \u0016w) = fwpg if C(p) 6\u0012 A and fp( \u0016w) = f \u0016w;wpg if C(p) \u0012 A (so \u0093if p were true\u0094\nrefers to world wp, and also to the actual world \u0016w if p holds there);\n\u000f in wp exactly those atomic propositions b are false for which :(p! b) 2 A.\nThe rest of Lemma 1 \u0096 showing that all p 2 A hold in \u0016w \u0096 is easily adapted.\nUsing (6), it then follows that a quota rule F(mp)p2X+ is consistent if and only ifX\na2C(p)[fp!b;:bg(n\u0000ma) < n for all p! b 2 X; or equivalentlyX\na2C(p)\n(n\u0000ma) +mb \u0014 mp!b for all p! b 2 X. (7)\nNote that this characterisation indeed reduces to Theorem 1 if X is simple.\nBy contrast, classical logic leads in step 1 to new inconsistent sets of type fb;:(p!\nb)g \u0012 X and f:a;:(p! b)g with a 2 C(p), as is seen by adapting Lemma 1* (without\neven having to rede\u0085ne the classical interpretation v : L ! fT; Fg). As a result, a\nquota rule F(mp)p2X+ is classically consistent if and only if\nma = n and mp!b = mb = 1 for all p! b 2 X and all a 2 C(p). (8)\nAgain, this characterisation reduces to Theorem 1* if X is simple.\nNow let X be bi-simple. In step 1, the sets of type fa;:b; a$ bg or f:a; b; a$ bg\nor fa $ b;:(b $ agg capture all types of (non-classical) inconsistency. This can be\nshown by again adapting Lemma 1 and its proof; when de\u0085ning the C+-interpretation\n(W; (fp); (vw)), we simply have to replace the second bullet point of (b) by:\n\u000f in the world wa (to which \u0093if a were true\u0094refers), exactly those atomic propos-\nitions b are false for which :(a$ b) 2 A or :(b$ a) 2 A.\nBy adapting Lemma 2 and its proof (or by using (6) and that m:q = n\u0000mq + 1\nfor all q 2 X), a quota rule F(mp)p2X+ is seen to be consistent if and only if, for all\na $ b 2 X, mb \u0014 ma +ma$b \u0000 n and ma \u0014 mb +ma$b \u0000 n and if also b $ a 2 X\nma$b \u0015 mb$a ; which is equivalent to:\nma$b = n and ma = mb for all a$ b 2 X. (9)\nSo all bi-implications need the unanimity threshold, and two atomic propositions\n(\u0093issues\u0094) need the same threshold if they are linked by a bi-implication in X or,\nmore generally, by a path of bi-implications in X.\nIn contrast, classical logic leads (by adapting Lemma 1*) to the additional types of\ninconsistency fa; b;:(a$ b)g; f:a;:b;:(a$ b)g (which are arti\u0085cial since negating\na$ b shouldn\u0092t constrain a\u0092s and b\u0092s truth values: it shouldn\u0092t establish the constraint\na$ :b). This leads (using (6)) to the additional inequalities\nma +mb +m:(a$b) > 2n and m:a +m:b +m:(a$b) > 2n for all a$ b 2 X.\nIn this, we have by (9)m:(a$b) = 1, so thatma+mb \u0015 2n andm:a+m:b \u0015 2n, hence\nma = mb = m:a = m:b = n, a contradiction. So there is no classically consistent\nquota rule.\n16\nTransforming implication agendas into semi-simple ones. Semi-simple im-\nplication agendas are of special interest. While they exclude from the agenda many\nconnection rules \u0096 all uni-directional ones with non-atomic consequent and all bi-\ndirectional ones \u0096 each connection rule of the excluded type can be rewritten, in\nlogically equivalent terms, as a conjunction of connection rules of the non-excluded\ntype p! b with atomic b: indeed, each uni-directional connection rule p! q is equi-\nvalent to the conjunction ^b2C(q)nC(p)(p! b), and each bi-directional connection rule\np$ q is equivalent to the conjunction \u0000^b2C(q)nC(p)(p! b)\u0001 ^ \u0000^b2C(p)nC(q)(q ! b)\u0001.\nSo every implication agenda X can be transformed into a semi-simple one ~X by re-\nplacing every \u0093non-allowed\u0094connection rule r 2 X+ by all the \u0093allowed\u0094ones p! b\nof which r is a conjunction (up to logical equivalence). For instance, the implication\nagenda X given by X+ = fa; b; c; c $ (a ^ b)g, which models the judges\u0092decision\nproblem in a law suit (see Section 2), can be transformed into the semi-simple im-\nplication agenda ~X given by ~X+ = fa; b; c; c ! a; c ! b; (a ^ b) ! cg; under ~X,\nthe judges decide not en bloc on c $ (a ^ b), but separately on whether liability of\nthe defendant implies breach of the contract, whether liability implies validity of the\ncontract, and whether breach of a valid contract implies liability.\nShould we conclude from this that all collective decision problems describable by\nan implication agenda X, like the mentioned one of judges in a law suit, can be\nremodelled using the corresponding semi-simple implication agenda ~X? And that\nwe could therefore restrict ourselves to the semi-simple case? Not quite, because the\nchange of agenda alters the decision problem. More precisely, it re\u0085nes (i.e. augments)\nthe decision problem: indeed, from any (complete and consistent) judgment set for ~X\nwe can always derive a unique one forX, but not vice versa. In the example just given,\nthe judgments on the \u0093new\u0094connection rules c! a; c! b; (a ^ b)! c 2 ~X together\nimply a judgment on the \u0093old\u0094 one c $ (a ^ b) 2 X, but not vice versa because if\nc $ (a ^ b) is negated we do not know which one(s) of c ! a; c ! b; (a ^ b) ! c to\nnegate (we only know that at least one of them must be negated). In summary, it is\ntrue that the decision problem described by X can be settled by moving to the semi-\nsimple agenda ~X, but one thereby settles more and one uses richer in- and output\ninformation in the aggregation.\n6 General implication agendas\nMany implication agendas are of neither of the kinds analysed so far, because they\ncontain connection rules like a ! (b ^ c) or (a ^ b) $ (a ^ c). Which quota rules\nare consistent for general implication agendas (in the non-classical logic C+)? In\nprinciple, the above two-step procedure applies again. But, for an agenda class as\nrich as this one, a so far neglected question becomes pressing: what is it that makes\nan inconsistent set Y \u0012 X a \u0093type of inconsistency\u0094 (in step 1)? Why for instance\ndid we count sets fa; a! b;:bg \u0012 X but not sets fa; a! b; b! c;:cg \u0012 X as types\nof inconsistency for simple implication agendas X? Surely, the set Y of all types of\ninconsistency Y \u0012 X must, to enable step 1, be chosen such that\nevery inconsistent set A \u0012 X satisfying ( 3) has a subset in Y. (10)\nBut usually many choices of Y satisfy (10). Intuitively, it is useful to choose Y small\nand simple. An always possible \u0096but often unduly large \u0096choice of Y is to include\n17\nin Y all minimal inconsistent sets Y \u0012 X.18 For simple implication agendas X, we\nchose Y = ffa; a ! b;:bg : a ! b 2 Xg, although we could have also included\nminimal inconsistent sets of type fa; a! b; b! c;:cg \u0012 X. We were able to exclude\nsuch sets (and still satisfy (10)) because such sets are reducible in the following sense.\nFor a set A \u0012 X satisfying (3), if A \u0013 fa; a ! b; b ! c;:cg then, as A contains b or\n:b, either A \u0013 fb; b! c;:cg or A \u0013 fa; a! b;:bg, whence A has a subset in Y.\nIn Section 7, a general method to choose Y is developed, based on a formalisation\nof what it means to \u0093reduce\u0094an inconsistent set to a simpler one; Y then contains\nirreducible sets. Applied to implication agendas, the method yields two kinds of\nirreducible sets, i.e. two types of inconsistency (as shown in the appendix19):\n(Ir+) sets representing an inconsistency between a non-negated connection rule and\natomic or negated atomic propositions, like fa! (b^c); a;:bg or fa$ b;:a; bg;\n(Ir\u0000) sets representing an inconsistency between a negated connection rule and non-\nnegated connection rules, like f:(a ! (b ^ c)); a ! b; a ! cg or f:(a !\n(b ^ c ^ d)); a! (b ^ c); a$ dg.\nIn step 2, these irreducible sets yield a system of inequalities whose successive\nsimpli\u0085cation gives the characterisation of Theorem 2 below. This characterisation\ninvolves, for every p! q 2 X, a particular set Xp!q. This set is de\u0085ned in two steps.\nFirst, we form the set\nXp := fs 2 L : p! s 2 X or p$ s 2 X or s$ p 2 Xg\nof all propositions \u0093reachable\u0094 from p via (bi-)implications in X. From Xp we then\nform the set\nXp!q := fS \u0012 Xp : S is minimal subject to C(q)nC(p) \u0012 [s2SC(s)g\nof all sets S \u0012 Xp that have, and are minimal subject to, this property: each atomic\nproposition \u0093in\u0094 q (but not \u0093in\u0094 p) is \u0093in\u0094 some s 2 S. So the sets S 2 Xp!q\nminimally \u0093cover\u0094C(q)nC(p).\nEvaluating Xp and Xp!q is purely mechanical. As a \u0085rst example, suppose\nX+ = fa; b; c; a! b; a! c; a! (b ^ c)g. (11)\nHere all three implications have antecedent a, where Xa = fb; c; b ^ cg. From Xa we\nthen derive Xa!b; Xa!c and Xa!(b^c). For instance, Xa!b contains fbg \u0012 Xa and\nfb^ cg \u0012 Xa as both minimally \u0093cover\u0094b, but contains neither fcg \u0012 Xa (which fails\nto \u0093cover\u0094 b), nor fb; cg \u0012 Xa (which \u0093covers\u0094 b non-minimally as we can remove\nc), nor any other set S \u0012 Xa. Further, Xa!(b^c) does not contain fc; b ^ cg \u0012 Xa:\nalthough this set \u0093covers\u0094 b ^ c (as all atomic propositions \u0093in\u0094 b ^ c are \u0093in\u0094some\ns 2 fc; b^ cg), it does so non-minimally (as c can be removed); but Xa!(b^c) contains\nfb; cg and fb ^ cg (which \u0093cover\u0094b ^ c minimally). In summary,\nXa!b = ffbg; fb ^ cgg; Xa!c = ffcg; fb ^ cgg; Xa!(b^c) = ffb; cg; fb ^ cgg. (12)\n18Y is minimal inconsistent if Y is inconsistent but its proper subsets are consistent.\n19 In fact, each type has two subtypes, one for uni- and one for bi-directional connection rules.\n18\nAs a second example, suppose\nX+ = fa; b; c; a! b; a! (b ^ c); c$ ag. (13)\nThe two implications, a ! b and a ! (b ^ c), both have antecedent a, where Xa =\nfb; c; b ^ cg. From Xa we then derive that:\nXa!b = ffbg; fb ^ cgg, Xa!(b^c) = ffb; cg; fb ^ cgg. (14)\nSets Xp!q appear in Theorem 2 because they are needed to describe inconsist-\nencies of type (Ir\u0000). Let me give an intuition for why the sets Xp!q relate to\ninconsistencies of type (Ir\u0000) (details are in the appendix). For the agenda (11),\nY = f:(a ! (b ^ c)); a ! b; a ! cg is an inconsistency of type (Ir\u0000). Y is\ninconsistent precisely because the conjuncts of a ^ b are \u0093covered\u0094 by the set of\nconsequents of a ! b; a ! c 2 Y , i.e. by fb; cg; in fact, they are so minimally:\nfb; cg 2 Xa!(b^c). Another agenda X might have the inconsistency of type (Ir\u0000)\nf:(a! (b^ c^ d)); a! (b^ c); a$ dg. This set is inconsistent precisely because the\nconjuncts of b ^ c ^ d are \u0093covered\u0094by the set of consequents fb ^ c; dg; they are so\nminimally: fb ^ c; dg 2 Xa!(b^c^d).\nI now state the characterisation result (formally proven in the appendix). As\nusual, A\u0001B denotes the symmetric di\u00a4erence (AnB) [ (BnA) of sets A and B.\nTheorem 2 A quota rule F(mp)p2X+ for an implication agenda X is consistent if and\nonly if the thresholds satisfy the following:\n(a) for every p! q 2 X,X\na2C(p)\n(n\u0000ma) + max\nb2C(q)nC(p)\nmb \u0014 mp!q \u0014 n\u0000 max\nS2Xp!q\nX\ns2S:p!s2X\n(n\u0000mp!s);\n(b) for every p $ q 2 X, (i) mp$q = n, (ii) ma = n for all a 2 C(p) \\ C(q), and\n(iii) ma is the same for all a 2 C(p)\u0001C(q) and equals n if jC(p)\u0001C(q)j \u0015 3.\nTheorem 2 characterises consistent quota rules by complicated (in)equalities. A\nrough interpretation is:\n\u000f inconsistencies of type (Ir+) are prevented by the LHS inequalities of (a) and\nby (b);\n\u000f given the LHS inequalities of (a) and (b), inconsistencies of type (Ir\u0000) are\nprevented by the RHS inequalities in (a).\nMore detailed clues to understand the conditions (a) and (b) are given at the\nsection end, drawing on the insights gained above on the simple, semi-simple and\nbi-simple case.\nIn practice, the system (a)&(b) often simpli\u0085es. Part (a) or part (b) drops out if\nX contains no uni- or no bi-directional connection rules, respectively. If X is simple,\nsemi-simple or bi-simple, (a)&(b) reduces to the conditions derived earlier (namely\n(1), (7) or (9), respectively).20 Further, the system (a)&(b) may simplify once the\n20 If X is simple, this is so because (b) drops out and because in (a) the RHS inequality holds\ntrivially (by Xp!q = ffqgg) and the LHS inequality reduces to n\u0000mp +mq \u0014 mp!q.\n19\nconcrete sets Xp!q, p ! q 2 X, are inserted, possibly resulting in a simpler set of\nconditions that o\u00a4ers an intuition for the size and structure of the space of possible\nthreshold assignments. The next example demonstrate this.\nExample. Consider the agenda in (13). Which thresholds (mp)p2X+ guarantee\nconsistency? By Theorem 2, three conditions must hold: one for a ! b (part (a)),\none for a! (b^ c) (part (a)), and one for c$ a (part (b)). The three conditions are:8><>:\nn\u0000ma +mb \u0014 ma!b \u0014 n\u0000maxS2Xa!b\nX\ns2S:a!s2X(n\u0000ma!s)\nn\u0000ma +maxfmb;mcg \u0014 ma!(b^c) \u0014 n\u0000maxS2Xa!(b^c)\nX\ns2S:a!s2X(n\u0000ma!s)\nmc$a = n and ma = mc.\n(15)\nIn this system, the upper bounds of ma!b and ma!(b^c) \u0096 I call them Ba!b and\nBa!(b^c), respectively \u0096should be computed by inserting the sets Xa!b and Xa!(b^c)\nas given in (14). Then Ba!b and Ba!(b^c) greatly simplify (and turn out to be equal)\nbecause each summation \u0093\nX\ns2S:a!s2X\u0094runs over just one term:\nBa!b = n\u0000max\n8<: X\ns2fbg:a!s2X\n(n\u0000ma!s);\nX\ns2fb^cg:a!s2X\n(n\u0000ma!s)\n9=;\n= n\u0000maxfn\u0000ma!b; n\u0000ma!(b^c)g = minfma!b;ma!(b^c)g,\nBa!(b^c) = n\u0000max\n8<: X\ns2fb;cg:a!s2X\n(n\u0000ma!s);\nX\ns2fb^cg:a!s2X\n(n\u0000ma!s)\n9=;\n= n\u0000maxfn\u0000ma!b; n\u0000ma!(b^c)g = minfma!b;ma!(b^c)g.\nSo, in the system (15), the RHS inequalities on the \u0085rst two lines are jointly equivalent\nto ma!b = ma!(b^c). By ma = mc, the LHS inequality on the second line implies\nn\u0000ma +maxfmb;mag \u0014 ma!(b^c), and so maxfn\u0000ma +mb; ng \u0014 ma!(b^c); which\n(by ma!(b^c) \u0014 n) implies that ma!(b^c) = n, and that n \u0000 ma + mb \u0014 n, i.e.\nmb \u0014 ma. Using all this, the system (15) is equivalent to:\nmb \u0014 ma = mc and ma!b = ma!(b^c) = mc$a = n.\nThis is an example of how the presence of a bi -directional connection rule r in X can\ndrastically narrow down the possibility space, especially relative to thresholds of r,\nof atomic propositions \u0093in\u0094r, and of connection rules logically related to r.\nI now record two corollaries of Theorem 2. First, a possibility result follows.21\nCorollary 2 For an implication agenda X, there exists\n(i) a consistent quota rule F(mp)p2X+ (hence a consistent, complete, independent,\nanonymous, monotonic and responsive aggregation rule with universal domain);\n21See Section 2 and footnote 11 for the conditions listed in part (i). By a di\u00a4erent proof, part (i)\nholds more generally for any agenda X for which each p 2 X+ is atomic or a connection rule (where,\nunlike for implication agendas, the atomic propositions in X+ may di\u00a4er from those contained in the\nconnection rules in X+).\n20\n(ii) a single consistent quota rule F(mp)p2X+ with identical thresholds mp; p 2 X+,\nnamely the quota rule with a unanimity threshold mp = n for all p 2 X+.\nProof. As (ii) implies (i), I only show (ii). Let X be an implication agenda and\nF(mp)p2X+ a quota rule with identical thresholds mp = m (2 f1; :::; ng). If m = n\nthen (a)&(b) hold, implying consistency. Conversely, assume consistency. So (a)&(b)\nhold. X contains a p ! q or a p $ q (otherwise X would be empty, hence not an\nagenda). In the second case, m = n by (b). In the \u0085rst case, the LHS inequality in\n(a) implies\nX\na2C(p)(n\u0000m) +m \u0014 m, whence again m = n. \u0004\nSo there is possibility \u0096 but how large is it? That is, how much freedom does\nTheorem 2 leave us in the choice of thresholds? As I now show, paths and cycles in X\nimpose rather severe restrictions. Extending earlier de\u0085nitions from simple to general\nimplication agendas, consider the network over the atomic propositions in X, where\nan atomic proposition a 2 X a parent of another one b 2 X if there is a p ! q 2 X\nor a p$ q 2 X or a q $ p 2 X such that a 2 C(p) and b 2 C(q)nC(p). Parenthood\nyields the notion of an ancestor by transitive closure. A path is a sequence (a1; :::; ak)\n(k \u0015 2) where aj is a parent of aj+1 for all j < k; it is a cycle if a1 = ak.\nCorollary 3 Let F(mp)p2X+ be a consistent quota rule for an implication agenda X.\n(i) If a 2 X is an ancestor of b 2 X then ma \u0015 mb.\n(ii) If a; b 2 X occur in a cycle (i.e. are ancestors of each other) then ma = mb\nand mp!q = n for all p! q 2 X with a 2 C(p) and b 2 C(q)nC(p).\nProof. Let X and F(mp)p2X+ be as speci\u0085ed.\n(i) Let a 2 X be a parent of b 2 X (obviously it su\u00a2 ces to consider this case).\nThen a 2 C(p) and b 2 C(q)nC(p), where p! q 2 X or p$ q 2 X or q $ p 2 X. In\nthe last two cases, (b) implies ma \u0015 mb. In the \u0085rst case, the LHS inequality in (a)\nimplies (n\u0000ma) +mb \u0014 mp!q, so mb \u0014 mp!q \u0000 n+ma \u0014 ma.\n(ii) Let a; b be as speci\u0085ed. By (i) ma \u0014 mb and mb \u0014 ma, hence ma = mb. Now\nlet p! q be as speci\u0085ed. By the LHS inequality in (a), (n\u0000ma)+mb \u0014 mp!q, hence\n(by ma = mb) mp!q = n. \u0004\nAn intuition for Theorem 2. Our earlier insights about simple, semi-simple\nand bi-simple implication agendas o\u00a4er some clues to understand Theorem 2, more\nprecisely to understand the necessity of (b) and of the LHS of (a). General implication\nagendas X go in three ways beyond simple ones: (i) implications p ! q 2 X may\nhave non-atomic antecedent p; (ii) implications p ! q 2 X may have non-atomic\nconsequent q; (iii) X may contain bi-implications p$ q.\nHere, (i) reminds of semi-simple agendas. And indeed, the LHS of (a), for which\n(i) is responsible, is closely related to our earlier characterisation (7) of consistent\nquota rules for semi-simple agendas. To see why, suppose \u0085rst that in (a) p ! q\nhas atomic consequent q. Then the LHS of (a) coincides with the inequality in (7).\nNow suppose q is non-atomic. Then p ! q is logically equivalent to the conjunction\n^b2C(q)nC(p)p! b, and the LHS of (a) is equivalent to applying the inequality in (7)\nto all implications p! b; b 2 C(q)nC(p).\nFurther, (iii) reminds of bi-simple agendas. Part (b), for which (iii) is responsible,\nis indeed closely related to our characterisation (9) of consistent quota rules for bi-\nsimple agendas. If in (b) both p and q are atomic, (b) is equivalent to the condition\n21\nin (9). If p and\/or q is non-atomic, (b) is the right generalisation of (9), as formally\nshown in the appendix.\nFinally, (ii) is the aspect in which general implication agendas go substantially\nbeyond both semi- and bi-simple ones. It is responsible for the (complex) RHS in-\nequalities in (a). These inequalities are needed because (ii) introduces new types of\ninconsistency like fa! b; a! c;:(a! (b ^ c))g.\n7 An abstract characterisation result\nA central issue so far was that each agenda X has its own types\/sources of inconsist-\nency Y \u0012 X (e.g. the sets fa; a ! b;:bg \u0012 X if X is a simple implication agenda).\nWhat exactly are \u0093types\/sources\u0094of inconsistency? They are irreducible sets Y \u0012 X,\nas made precise now. I introduce an abstract simplicity relation between inconsistent\nsets Y \u0012 X, which allows one to simplify inconsistent sets, which yields irreducible\nsets. I do this in full generality, i.e. independently of implication agendas and the\nparticular logic C+. This gives rise to an abstract characterisation result of which\nall above characterisations are applications. The notion of irreducible sets generalises\na special irreducibility notion introduced by Dietrich and List [8]; it also generalises\nminimal inconsistent sets (which are based on set-inclusion rather than a general sim-\nplicity relation), and for this reason the abstract characterisation result generalises\nthe characterisation by the \u0093intersection property\u0094in Nehring and Puppe [18, 19].\nTo avoid unnecessary restrictions to special judgment aggregation problems, we\nadopt Dietrich\u0092s [3] general logics framework in this section: let X \u0012 L be an ar-\nbitrary agenda of propositions from any formal language L with well-behaved logical\ninterconnections.22 Further, let I be the set of all inconsistent sets Y \u0012 X.\nGiven the intended purpose, I will de\u0085ne irreducibility in such a way that\nevery inconsistent and complete set A \u0012 X has an irreducible subset. (16)\nThis property ensures that collective consistency holds if and only if no irreducible\nset is ever collectively accepted. Property (16) is the analogue of the property (10)\nunderlying the 2-step procedure in earlier sections. Of course, we could achieve (16)\nby simply de\u0085ning \u0093irreducible\u0094 as \u0093minimal inconsistent\u0094, since any inconsistent\nset A \u0012 X has a minimal inconsistent subset. But this would often create a large\nnumber of irreducible sets (hence many redundant inequalities in step 2). The ir-\nreducibility notion I introduce depends on a parameter: the simplicity notion used.\nUnder a certain (extreme) simplicity notion, \u0093irreducible\u0094will coincide with \u0093minimal\ninconsistent\u0094; other simplicity notions lead to fewer irreducible sets.\nI now de\u0085ne simplicity (from which I later de\u0085ne irreducibility). Suppose we have\na notion of simplicity of sets in I given by a binary relation < on I, where \u0093Z < Y \u0094\n22The well-behavedness can be expressed either in terms of the entailment notion \u000f (conditions L1-\nL3 in Dietrich [3]) or in terms of the inconsistency notion (conditions I1-I3 in Dietrich [3]) (assuming\nthat both notions are interde\u0085nable; see Section 2). Stated in terms of the consistency notion,\nthe three conditions are: (I1) sets fp;:pg \u0012 L are inconsistent; (I2) subsets of consistent sets are\nconsistent; (I3) the empty set ; is consistent, and each consistent set A \u0012 L has a consistent superset\nB \u0012 L containing a member of each pair p;:p 2 L. If the agenda X is in\u0085nite, I also assume the\nlogic to be compact: every inconsistent set A \u0012 L has a \u0085nite inconsistent subset. All this holds for\nC+ and most familiar logics, including propositional and predicate logics, classical and non-classical\nlogics, with the important exception of non-monotonic logics.\n22\nis interpreted as \u0093Z is simper than Y \u0094. There is much freedom in how to specify <\n(the goal being to obtain \u0093nice\u0094 irreducible sets, as explained later). For instance,\nwe might de\u0085ne < by Z < Y :, jZj < jY j (i.e. \u0093simpler\u0094means \u0093smaller\u0094), or by\nZ < Y :, Z (\fnite Y (i.e. \u0093simpler\u0094means to be a proper \u0085nite subset). I place\nonly two restrictions on the simplicity notion:\nProper subsets are simpler: for all Y; Z 2 I, if Z (\fnite Y then Z < Y .23\nNo in\u0085nite simpli\u0085cation chains: < is well-founded, i.e. there is no in\u0085nite\nsequence (Yk)k=1;2;::: in I such that Yk+1 < Yk for all k = 1; 2; :::24\nA simplicity relation is a binary relation< on I with these properties. For instance\nthe two relations < just mentioned are simplicity relations.\nSuppose we have chosen a simplicity relation <. Then (16) holds for the following\nreason. Starting from an arbitrary complete set A 2 I, one can \u0085nd a \u0085nite sequence\nof simpli\u0085cations A = Y1 > Y2 > ::: such that the simpli\u0085ed sets Y1; Y2; ::: all remain\nsubsets of A and the sequence terminates with an irreducible set (as de\u0085ned below).\nAn example is helpful. Suppose A = Y1 is in\u0085nite. Then in a \u0085rst simpli\u0085cation\nstep we can move to a \u0085nite inconsistent subset Y2 \u0012 A (which exists since the\nlogic is compact or X is \u0085nite; see footnote 22). To bring the example into familiar\nterrain, assume that the agenda is an implication agenda and that Y2 = fa; a !\n(b1 ^ :::^ b5); b6; (b1 ^ ::::^ b6)$ c;:cg. In the next simpli\u0085cation step, there are two\ncases.\nCase 1: If all of b1; :::; b5 are in A, the inconsistent set Y3 := fb1; :::; b6; (b1^::::^b6)$\nc;:cg is a subset of A.\nCase 2: If not all of b1; :::; b5 are in A, say bj =2 A, then :bj 2 A (as A is complete),\nand so the inconsistent set Y 03 := fa; a! (b1 ^ ::: ^ b5);:bjg is a subset of A.\nOf course, the new subset of A (Y3 or Y 03) is not under all simplicity notions <\nsimpler than Y2: for instance, we have Y3 6< Y2 if < is the \u0093smaller than\u0094relation (i.e.\nZ < Y , jZj < jY j). There is however an obvious simplicity notion for which both Y3\nand Y 03 are simpler than Y2: they contain fewer connection rules than Y2 (namely one\ninstead of two). Indeed the application to implication agendas (in the appendix) will\nuse a simplicity relation < that lexicographically prioritises minimising the number of\n(possibly negated) connection rules over minimising the number of (possibly negated)\natomic propositions, thereby ensuring that Y3 < Y2 and Y 03 < Y2.\nThe set Y3 is obtained from Y2 in a particular manner: I have taken in \u0093new\u0094\npropositions (namely b1; :::; b5) each of which is logically entailed by some set of \u0093old\u0094\npropositions, namely by V = fa; a ! (b1 ^ ::: ^ b5)g \u0012 Y2. The fact that each\n\u0093new\u0094proposition bj is entailed by a V \u0012 Y2 has the important consequence that a\nsimpli\u0085cation of Y2 into a subset of A is possible whether or not A contains all \u0093new\u0094\npropositions: if A does then Y3 \u0012 A, and if A does not contain the \u0093new\u0094proposition\n23Z (\fnite Y stands for Z ( Y&jZj < 1. \u0093(\fnite\u0094 can be replaced throughout by \u0093(\u0094 if one\nassumes a \u0085nite agenda.\n24< need not be connected, nor even transitive (if < also satis\u0085es these conditions, < is a well-\norder). Note that well-foundedness implies asymmetry (i.e. if Z < Y then Y \u0004 Z), hence irre\u0087exivity.\nFurther, given asymmetry and transitivity, < is well-founded if and only if every set ; 6= J \u0012 I on\nwhich < is connected has a least element (i.e. a Z 2 J with Z < Y for all Y 2 J nfZg).\n23\nbj then V [ f:bjg = Y 03 \u0012 A. In the latter case, what is it that allows us to simplify\nY2 into V [ f:bjg? First, the entailment V \u000f bj guarantees us that V [ f:bjg is\nindeed an inconsistent set, i.e. is in the range I of the simplicity relation. But this\nalone does not su\u00a2 ce: V [ f:bjg must actually be simpler than Y2. In summary,\nthe following properties of the set Y3 ensure that Y2 can be simpli\u0085ed (into Y3 or\nanother set): Y3 is simpler than Y2, and moreover each \u0093new\u0094proposition p 2 Y3nY2\nis entailed by a set of \u0093old\u0094propositions V \u0012 Y2 such that V [ f:pg is simpler than\nY2. In this case I call Y3 a reduction of Y2, as formally de\u0085ned now.25\nDe\u0085nition 1 Given a simplicity relation <,\n(i) Z 2 I is a (<-)reduction of Y 2 I (and Y is (<-)reducible to Z) if Z < Y and\nmoreover each p 2 ZnY is entailed by some V \u0012 Y satisfying V [ f:pg < Y ;\n(ii) Y 2 I is (<-)irreducible if it has no reduction; let IR< := fY 2 I : Y is\n<-irreducibleg (the set of of minimal elements of the reduction relation).\nThe art is to use a simplicity relation < that allows su\u00a2 ciently many (and the\n\u0093right\u0094) simpli\u0085cations so as to give few and elegant irreducible sets (hence a simple\ncharacterisation of collective consistency). Let me take up the two example above.\nExample 1 (being simpler as being a subset). Let < be (\fnite. Then reduction\ncoincides with simpli\u0085cation: Z 2 I is a reduction of Y 2 I if and only if Z (\fnite Y .\nSo Y is irreducible if and only if Y is a minimal inconsistent set, i.e. IR< = MI\nwhere\nMI := fY 2 I : no proper subset of Y is in Ig.\nIt can be shown that if X is a simple implication agenda then the set IR< =MI\nconsists of all sets Y \u0012 X of type Y = fp;:pg or type\nY = fa1; a1 ! a2; :::; ak\u00001 ! ak;:akg (a1; :::; ak pairwise distinct, k \u0015 2). (17)\nExample 2 (being simpler as being smaller). Let Z < Y :, jZj < jY j. Then\nreduction is equivalent to Dietrich and List\u0092s [8] special reduction notion (see footnote\n25). If X is again a simple implication agenda, IR< is now much smaller than in\nExample 1: IR< can be shown to consist of all sets Y \u0012 X of type fp;:pg, or of\ntype (17) with k = 2 (i.e. of type fa; a ! b;:bg, like in Lemma 1). To see why\nsets of type (17) are not irreducible if k > 2, note that such a set Y is reducible for\ninstance to Z := fak\u00001; ak\u00001 ! ak;:akg, because jZj < jY j and ak\u00001 is entailed by\nV := fa1; a1 ! a2; :::; ak\u00002 ! ak\u00001g where jV [f:ak\u00001gj < jY j. As a di\u00a4erent agenda,\nconsider a standard strict preference aggregation problem with a set of optionsK 6= ;.\nThis can be represented by the agenda XK := fxPy;:xPy : x; y 2 Kg in a suitable\npredicate logic with a binary predicate P for strict preference, a set of constants\nK for options, and a set of axioms containing the rationality conditions on strict\nlinear orders, including for instance the transitivity axiom (8v1)(8v2)(8v3)((v1Pv2 ^\nv2Pv3) ! v1Pv3) (see Dietrich and List [7]; also List and Pettit [16]). Dietrich and\nList [8] call a set Y \u0012 XK a \u0093k-cycle\u0094(k \u0015 1) if it has the form\nY = fx1Px2; x2Px3; :::; xk\u00001Pxk; xkPx1g (x1; :::; xk 2 K pairwise distinct), (18)\n25 In the special case that < is de\u0085ned by Y < Z :, jY j < jZj, this de\u0085nition of reduction (and\nirreducibility) becomes equivalent to that introduced for di\u00a4erent purposes by Dietrich and List [8].\nProposition 1 generalises one of their results. The present notion of reduction is more \u0087exible and\ngeneral, as sets may be simpli\u0085ed in other ways than through decreasing their size.\n24\nor arises from such a set by replacing one or more of the members xPy by the\nlogically equivalent proposition :yPx. They show that the irreducible sets are the\nk-cycles with k \u0014 3. To see why for k > 3 a k-cycle is not irreducible (though\nminimal inconsistent), note that a set Y of type (18) with k \u0015 4 is reducible to\nZ := fx1Px2; x2Px3; x3Px1g (a 3-cycle), because jZj < jY j and x3Px1 is entailed by\nV := fx3Px4; x4Px5; :::; xkPx1g where jV [ f:x3Px1gj < jY j.\nTo understand the properties of reduction better, let me record two lemmas.\nLemma 3 Given any simplicity relation <, the reduction relation is itself a simplicity\nrelation, that is:\n(i) for all Y; Z 2 I, if Z (\fnite Y then Z is a reduction of Y ;\n(ii) there is no in\u0085nite sequence (Yk)k=1;2;::: in I such that Yk+1 is a reduction of\nYk for all k = 1; 2; :::\nProof. Both parts follow immediately from the analogous properties of <. \u0004\nLemma 4 (i) For any simplicity relation <, IR< \u0012MI, and if < = (\fnite then\nIR< =MI.\n(ii) For any simplicity relations < and <0, if < is a subrelation of <0 then IR<0 \u0012\nIR<.\nProof. (i) Let < be a simplicity relation. For all Y 2 I, if Y =2 MI< then Y has\nan inconsistent proper subset Z, which we can choose \u0085nite by compactness of the\nlogic. By Lemma 3 Y is reducible to Z, whence Y =2 IR<.\n(ii) If < and <0 are simplicity relations and < is a subrelation of <0, then <-\nreduction is a subrelation of <0-reduction, and so IR<0 \u0012 IR<. \u0004\nLemma 4 gives a general idea on how the set of irreducible sets IR< depends\non the simplicity notion < used. The \u0085ner < is, i.e. the more simpli\u0085cations are\nallowed, the more reductions are allowed, and so the smaller IR< is (see part (ii)).\nThe coarsest choice of < is (\fnite; then the only reductions are those to \u0085nite proper\nsubsets, and IR< is maximal: IR< =MI, whereas in general IR< \u0012MI (see part\n(i)).\nI now prove the central property (16) announced earlier: every inconsistent and\ncomplete judgment set A \u0012 X has an irreducible subset (reachable from A via \u0085nitely\nmany simpli\u0085cations).26\nProposition 1 Given any simplicity relation <, every inconsistent and complete set\nA \u0012 X has a subset in IR<.\nSo, by Example 2 above, if X is a simple implication agenda then any inconsistent\nand complete set A \u0012 X has a subset of type fp;:pg or fa; a! b;:bg (as also shown\nin Lemma 1); and if X is instead the preference agenda XK , A has a subset that is a\nk-cycle with k \u0014 3 \u0096a well-known result of social choice theory since A corresponds\nto a connected strict preference relation \u001f on K with rationality violation.\n26The condition \u0093proper subsets are simpler\u0094 on the simplicity relation < may be dropped in\nProposition 1 but not in Theorem 3.\n25\nProof. Let < and A be as speci\u0085ed. Assume for a contradiction that A has no\nsubset in IR<. I recursively de\u0085ne a sequence (Yk)k=1;2;::: of inconsistent subsets of\nA such that Yk+1 < Yk for all k. This contradicts the well-foundedness of <.\nFirst, put Y1 := A, which is indeed an inconsistent subset of A.\nSecond, suppose Yk is already de\u0085ned. By assumption, Yk is reducible, say to\nZ 2 I. First assume Z \u0012 Yk. Letting Yk+1 := Z, it is true that Yk+1 is a subset of A\n(as Yk+1 \u0012 Yk \u0012 A) and that Yk+1 < Yk (as Yk+1 is a reduction of Yk). Now suppose\nZ * A. Then there is a p 2 ZnA. As Z is a reduction of Yk, there is a V \u0012 Yk that\nentails p with V [ f:pg < Yk. Letting Yk+1 := V [ f:pg, we have Yk+1 < Yk, and\nYk+1 \u0012 A because V \u0012 Yk \u0012 A and because :p 2 A since p =2 A and A is complete.\n\u0004\nBy Proposition 1, a quota rule F(mp)p2X+ is consistent if and only if it never\naccepts any Y 2 IR<. The following lemma tells which inequality we must impose\nto achieve this.\nLemma 5 For every minimal inconsistent (hence every irreducible) set Y \u0012 X, a\nquota rule F(mp)p2X+ never accepts all p 2 Y if and only if\nX\np2Y (n \u0000 mp) < n\n(where m:p := n\u0000mp + 1 for all p 2 X+).\nProof. Consider a minimal inconsistent Y \u0012 X and a quota rule F := F(mp)p2X+ .\nFirst assume\nP\np2Y (n \u0000 mp) \u0015 n. Then N can be partitioned into (possibly\nempty) subgroups Np; p 2 Y , of size jNpj \u0014 n\u0000mp. Construct a pro\u0085le (A1; :::; An)\nof complete and consistent judgment sets such that, for all p 2 Y , the people in Np\nreject just p out of Y , i.e. Ai \u0013 Y nfpg for all i 2 Np; such Ai\u0092s exist as Y nfpg is\nconsistent. Then Y \u0012 F (A1; :::; An) (as desired) since the number of people accepting\na p 2 Y is n\u0000 jNpj \u0015 n\u0000 (n\u0000mp) = mp.\nConversely, suppose that F has an outcome F (A1; :::; An) \u0013 Y . I show thatP\np2Y (n \u0000mp) \u0015 n. For all p 2 Y , put np := jfi : p 2 Aigj; hence jfi : p =2 Aigj =\nn\u0000 np. So\njf(p; i) 2 Y \u0002N : p =2 Aigj =\nX\np2Y\n(n\u0000 np).\nAs no Ai contains all p 2 Y , jf(p; i) 2 Y \u0002N : p =2 Aigj \u0015 n, i.e.\nP\np2Y (n\u0000 np) \u0015 n.\nSo, as for all p 2 Y we have np \u0015 mp (by p 2 F (A1; :::; An)),\nP\np2Y (n\u0000mp) \u0015 n. \u0004\nProposition 1 and Lemma 5 imply the desired characterisation result.\nTheorem 3 For any simplicity relation <, a quota rule F(mp)p2X+ is consistent if\nand only ifX\np2Y\n(n\u0000mp) < n for all Y 2 IR< (where m:p := n\u0000mp + 1 8p 2 X+).\nTheorem 3 generalises the anonymous case of the \u0093intersection property\u0094 result\nin Nehring and Puppe [18, 19]. This result makes no reference to a simplicity relation\nand usesMI instead of IR<. Hence it follows from Theorem 3 by choosing < such\nthat IR< = MI, i.e. by choosing < as the coarsest simplicity relation (\fnite. A\n26\nnon-anonymous variant of Theorem 3 can be derived similarly, generalising the non-\nanonymous intersection property result.27 One might wonder whether one could also\ngeneralise the (anonymous or non-anonymous) intersection property result in Dietrich\nand List [6] which requires no collective completeness28, again by using irreducible\nsets instead of minimal inconsistent sets. No straightforward generalisation works,\nsince the completeness assumption is essential in Proposition 1.\nIn general, the \u0085ner the simplicity relation < is chosen, the smaller IR< becomes,\nand hence the \u0093slimmer\u0094Theorem 3\u0092s characterisation becomes since redundant in-\nequalities are avoided. The question of how much smaller thanMI the set IR< can\nget (and hence how much \u0093slimmer\u0094than the intersection property result Theorem\n3\u0092s characterisation can get) depends on the concrete agenda X. In Example 2 above,\nIR< gets signi\u0085cantly smaller than MI. Note \u0085nally that if the inequalities have\nno solution, the agenda has no consistent quota rule. This is often so for agendas\nin classical logic, since here the judgments on atomic propositions fully settle the\njudgments on compound propositions.\nWhile theoretically elegant, Theorem 3\u0092s system of inequalities is abstract. Check-\ning whether it holds requires to know which sets are irreducible. The latter question\ncan even be non-decidable in the technical sense: in some logics (such as standard\npredicate logic), it is non-decidable whether a set of propositions is inconsistent; so\nderived notions like irreducibility or minimal inconsistency may also be non-decidable.\nIn view of applications, two corollaries are useful. Call an inconsistent set trivial\nif it contains a pair p;:p or contains a contradiction p (like a ^ :a). Any trivial\nY 2 IR< has by minimal inconsistency the form Y = fp;:pg or Y = fpg. So for\ntrivial Y 2 IR< the inequality\nX\np2Y (n \u0000mp) < n holds automatically, whatever\nthe thresholds (mp)p2X+ 2 f1; :::; ngX+ . Removing these redundant inequalities, we\nobtain a slightly slimmer characterisation:\nCorollary 4 Theorem 3 still holds if IR< is replaced by IR\u0003< := fY 2 IR< : Y is\nnon-trivialg:\nAs an illustration, consider a simple implication agenda X. By Theorem 1,\nF(mp)p2X+ is consistent if and only if\nmb \u0014 ma +ma!b \u0000 n for all a! b 2 X. (19)\nThis characterisation is equivalent to that of Corollary 4 if < is de\u0085ned by Z < Y :,\njZj < jY j: indeed, IR\u0003< = ffa; a! b;:bg : a! b 2 Xg by Example 2 above, so that\n27 If we endow each p 2 X+ not with a threshold mp 2 f1; :::; ng but, more generally, with a set Cp\nof (\u0093winning\u0094) coalitions C \u0012 N such that ; =2 Cp, N 2 Cp, and [C 2 Cp&C \u0012 C\u0003 \u0012 N ] ) C\u0003 2 Cp,\nwe can de\u0085ne an aggregation rule F(Cp)p2X+ with universal domain by F(Cp)p2X+ (A1; :::; An) = fp 2\nX : fi 2 N : p 2 Aig 2 Cpg (where C:p := fC \u0012 N : NnC =2 Cpg for all p 2 X+). Such a\nrule F(Cp)p2X+ is called a committee rule. The quota rules F(mp)p2X+ are precisely the anonymous\ncommittee rules (where each p 2 X+ has set of winning coalitions Cp = fC \u0012 N : jCj \u0015 mpg). The\nanalogue of Theorem 3 is: for any simplicty relation <, a committee rule F(Cp)p2X+ is consistent if\nand only if \\p2Y Cp 6= ; for all Y 2 IR< and all winning coalitions Cp 2 Cp, p 2 Y . This becomes\nthe non-anonymous intersection property result if IR< =MI, i.e. if we choose < := \u0012\fnite.\n28More precisely, it does not require for propositions p 2 X that m:p = n \u0000mp + 1 (or, in the\nnon-anonymous case discussed in footnote 27, that the coalitions winning for :p be the coalitions\nwhose complements are not winning for p).\n27\nthe inequalities\nX\np2Y (n \u0000 mp) < n; Y 2 IR\n\u0003\n<, are equivalent to the inequalities\n(19). If < is alternatively de\u0085ned as (\fnite, then by Example 1 above IR\u0003< consists of\nall sets of type (17); thus IR\u0003< is now much larger, and the resulting characterisation\nof Corollary 4 contains redundant inequalities.\nDetermining the set IR< (or IR\u0003<) is often hard, e.g. for general implication\nagendas. Determining a superset of it can be simpler \u0096and it su\u00a2 ces by the next\ncorollary, obtained by combining Corollary 4 with Theorem 3, the latter applied with\n< = (\fnite, i.e. with IR< =MI.\nCorollary 5 Theorem 3 still holds if IR< is replaced by any Y with IR\u0003< \u0012 Y \u0012\nMI.\nSo, to \u0085nd out for a concrete agenda which quota rules are consistent, it su\u00a2 ces\nto de\u0085ne a suitable simplicity relation < and determine some set Y with IR\u0003< \u0012 Y \u0012\nMI. Precisely this is done for implication agendas in the appendix.\n8 Conclusion\nConnection rules, of the uni-directional kind p! q or bi-directional kind p$ q, are\nat the heart of judgment aggregation. They express links that may be accepted or\nrejected, for instance causal links between facts or justi\u0085cational links between claims.\nOnce we interpret these (bi-)implications subjunctively, we can generate consistent\nand complete collective judgment sets by taking independent and anonymous votes\non the propositions, provided that we use appropriate acceptance thresholds (see\nTheorems 1 and 2 and Table 2). This possibility result holds for judgment aggregation\nproblems on so-called implication agendas.\nThe results on implication agendas are applications of an abstract result, Theorem\n3, which applies to arbitrary agendas in a general logic: it characterises consistent\naggregation in terms of so-called irreducible sets (which generalise minimal incon-\nsistent sets29). It would be interesting to apply this result to classes of agendas\nother than implication agendas, in order to gain new insights on (im)possibilities\nof propositionwise voting. However, at least as important as this would be to de-\nvelop a systematic understanding of non-propositionwise judgment aggregation rules.\nThough often mentioned, this route is largely unexplored.\n9 References\n[1] B.

The language L (de\u0085ned in\nSection 2) is endowed with the non-classical notions of entailment and (in)consistency\nde\u0085ned in Section 3 (using C+-interpretations). Recall that A (\u0012 L) is the set of\natomic propositions. Denote the set of all connection rules by R (= fa ! b; (a ^\nb) $ c; :::g). For all S \u0012 L let S: := f:p : p 2 Sg and \u0016S := S [ S:. We wish\nto apply Theorem 3 to X \u0096but with which simplicity relation <? De\u0085ning < as\n(\fnite gives a very complicated set IR< = MI (containing for instance sets like\nY = fa; a ! b; a0; a0 ! b0; (b ^ b0) ! (a ^ c);:cg). Even the \u0085ner simplicity relation\ngiven by Z < Y :, jZj < jY j, while suitable for simple implication agendas (see\nthe end of Section 7), is inappropriate in general since, as indicated in Section 7,\nwe would like to simplify sets like fa; a ! (b1 ^ b2 ^ b3); (b1 ^ b2 ^ b3) ! c;:cg into\nfb1; b2; b3; (b1 ^ b2 ^ b3) ! c;:cg on the grounds that the latter set contains fewer\nconnection rules despite of having more elements overall. The following lexicographic\nsimplicity notion allows us to perform such simpli\u0085cations and to get a grip on IR<.\nFor all inconsistent sets Z; Y \u0012 X,\nZ < Y :, (jZ \\ \u0016Rj; jZ \\ \u0016Aj) is lexicographically smaller than (jY \\ \u0016Rj; jY \\ \u0016Aj),\ni.e. jZ \\ \u0016Rj < jY \\ \u0016Rj or jZ \\ \u0016Rj = jY \\ \u0016Rj&jZ \\ \u0016Aj < jZ \\ \u0016Aj. For instance,\nfa;:bg < fa! bg as (0; 2) is lexicographically smaller than (1; 0).\nThe following is easily shown (using that the \u0093lexicographically smaller than\u0094\nrelation is well-founded).\nLemma 6 The above relation < is a simplicity relation.30\nTo identify the <-irreducible sets, we \u0085rst need to understand better which en-\ntailments and inconsistencies hold within implication agendas; hence the next two\ntechnical lemmas. Generalising Section 6\u0092s notation \u0093Xp\u0094, I put, for all p 2 L and all\nR \u0012 L,\nRp := fs 2 L : p! s 2 R or p$ s 2 R or s$ p 2 Rg,\nthe set of propositions \u0093reachable\u0094from p via (bi-)implications in R. I \u0085rst establish\na plausible fact about entailments between connection rules: namely, for instance,\nthat R = fp! b; p! (c^ d)g \u000f p! (b^ c) because each conjunct of b^ c (i.e. b and\nc) is a conjunct of some s 2 Rp = fb; c ^ dg.\nLemma 7 For all R \u0012 R and p! q 2 R,\nR \u000f p! q , C(q)nC(p) \u0012\n[\ns2Rp\nC(s).\nNote that this characterisation of R \u000f p! q implies one of R \u000f p$ q (for R \u0012 R\nand p$ q 2 R), since R \u000f p$ q if and only if R \u000f p! q and R \u000f q ! p.\nProof. Let R \u0012 R and p! q 2 R.\n30More generally, for any partition of X into sets X1; :::; Xk, a simplicity relation < is de\u0085ned by\nZ < Y :, [(jZ \\X1j; :::; jZ \\Xnj) is lexicographically smaller than (jY \\X1j; :::; jY \\Xnj)].\n30\n1. First let C(q)nC(p) \u0012\n[\ns2Rp\nC(s). Suppose all r 2 R hold in world w of\ninterpretation (W; (fr); (vw)). We have to show that p ! q holds in w, i.e. that all\na 2 C(q) hold in all w\u0003 2 fp(w). Let a 2 C(q) and w\u0003 2 fp(w). By assumption,\na 2 C(p) or a 2 C(s) for some s 2 Rp. In the \u0085rst case, a holds in w\u0003 as p does (by\nw\u0003 2 fp(w)). In the second case, a holds in w\u0003 as s does (by vw(p ! s) = T and\nw\u0003 2 fp(w)).\n2. Conversely, suppose that a 2 C(q)nC(p) but a =2\n[\ns2Rp\nC(s). To show\nR 2 p ! q, consider an interpretation (W; (fp); (vw)) such that: (i) W contains\nat least two distinct worlds w;w\u0003; (ii) all atomic propositions hold in w, (iii) all\natomic propositions except a hold in w\u0003, (iv) fp(w) = fw;w\u0003g (which is allowed as p\nholds in w and w\u0003), and (v) for all t 2 Lnfpg ft(w) \u0012 fwg. To complete the proof,\nI show that all r 2 R hold in w but p ! q doesn\u0092t. First, vw(p ! q) = F by (iv)\nand as vw\u0003(q) = F by (iii). To show the truth in w of all r 2 R, I show that of every\nimplication t ! s with t ! s 2 R or t $ s 2 R or s $ t 2 R. For such t ! s, if\nt 6= p then vw(t ! s) = T by (v) and (ii); and if t = p then vw(t ! s) = T by (iv)\nand (ii)-(iii) and using that a =2 C(s). \u0004\nThe next technical lemma shows that there are broadly two ways in which a subset\nA of the implication agenda X can be inconsistent (the second way, (20), holds for\ninstance if :(a! (b ^ c)); a! b; a! c 2 A.).\nLemma 8 If A \u0012 \u0016A[ \u0016R is inconsistent, then either already AnR: is inconsistent or\nA contains some :r 2 R: such that A \\R \u000f r. (20)\nProof. Suppose A \u0012 \u0016A[ \u0016R. Assume A\u0003 := AnR: is consistent and (20) does not\nhold. I show that A is consistent. For all :(p! q) 2 A,\n(\u000b) there is ap!q 2 C(q)nC(p) with ap!q =2 C(q0) for all q0 2 Ap,\nas otherwise C(q)nC(p) \u0012 [q02ApC(q0), whence by Lemma 7 A \\R \u000f p! q (take\nR := A \\ R and note that Rp = Ap), implying (20). Further, for all :(p $ q) 2 A,\neither\n(\f1) there is a1p$q 2 C(q)nC(p) with a1p$q =2 C(q0) for all q0 2 Ap\nor\n(\f2) there is a2p$q 2 C(p)nC(q) with a2p$q =2 C(p0) for all p0 2 Aq,\nas otherwise C(q)nC(p) \u0012 [q02ApC(q0) and C(p)jC(q) \u0012 [p02Aq , whence again by\nLemma 7 A \\R \u000f p! q and A \\R \u000f p! r, i.e. A \\R \u000f p$ q, implying (20).\nTo prove A\u0092s consistency, I construct an interpretation and show that in a world\nall r 2 A hold. Notationally, for any r 2 R let rmat be r\u0092s material counterpart:\n(p ! q)mat is :p _ q, and (p $ q)mat is (p ! q)mat ^ (q ! p)mat. Let Amat\u0003 be the\nset arising from A\u0003 by replacing all r 2 A\u0003 \\ R by rmat. Since A\u0003 is consistent and\nr j= rmat for all r 2 R, Amat\u0003 is also consistent. So there exists an interpretation\n(W; (fp); (vw)) and a world w such that\n(w1) all members of Amat\u0003 are true in w.\nAs the propositions in Amat\u0003 contain no subjunctive (bi-)implications, their truth\nvalues in w depend neither on other worlds nor on the functions fp; p 2 L. So we\nmay assume the following w.l.o.g.\n(w2) For all :(p ! q) 2 A, there is a world wp!q 2 Wnfwg in which all atomic\nproposition except ap!q hold; and wp!q 2 fp(w) but wp$q =2 fs(w) 8s 2 Lnfpg.\n31\n(w3) For all :(p $ q) 2 A with (\f1), there is a world w1p$q 2 Wnfwg in which\nall atomic propositions except a1p$q hold; and w1p$q 2 fp(w) but w1p$q =2 fs(w)\n8s 2 Lnfpg.\n(w4) For all :(p $ q) 2 A with (\f2), there is a world w2p$q 2 Wnfwg in which\nall atomic propositions except a2p$q hold; and w2p$q 2 fq(w) but w2p$q =2 fs(w)\n8s 2 Lnfqg.\n(w5) Worlds w0 2W other than those de\u0085ned in (w1)-(w4) are not reachable from\nw: w0 =2 fr(w) 8r 2 L.\nTo complete the proof, I consider any r 2 A and show that r holds in w.\nCase 1 : r is atomic or negated atomic. Then r 2 Amat\u0003 . So r holds in w by (w1).\nCase 2 : r is an implication s! t. Let w0 2 fs(w). I have to show that t holds in\nw0. If w0 = w, s holds in w by w 2 fs(w); so, as (s ! t)mat = :s _ t holds in w by\n(w1), t holds in w. Now let w0 6= w. Then by (w5), w0 is one of the worlds de\u0085ned in\n(w2)-(w4). Assume w0 = wp!q, a world de\u0085ned in (w2) (proofs for (w3) and (w4) are\nsimilar). By wp!q 2 fs(w) and (w2), p = s. By (w2), all atomic propositions except\nap!q hold in wp!q, where ap!q isn\u0092t a conjunct of t by (\u000b). So t holds in wp!q = w0.\nCase 3 : r is a bi-implication s$ t. s$ t holds in w if s! t and t! s are true\nin w. The latter can be shown by a procedure analogous to that in case 2.\nCase 4 : r is a negated implication :(p ! q). To show that r holds in w, I show\nthat p ! q fails in w. This is so because, by (w2), wp!q 2 fp(w) where q fails in\nwp!q as its conjunct ap!q fails.\nCase 5 : r is a negated bi-implication :(p $ q). To show that r holds in w, I\nshow that p $ q is false in w, i.e. that p ! q or q ! p is false in w. Under (\f1)\np! q is false in w (consider the world w1p$q and use (w3)), and under (\f2) q ! p is\nfalse in w (consider the world w2p$q and use (w4)). \u0004\nTo allow us to apply Corollary 5, I now de\u0085ne a class Y of inconsistent sets Y \u0012 X,\nand I show that IR\u0003< \u0012 Y \u0012MI. Let Y := Y! [Y$ [Y:! [Y:$, where Y!, Y$,\nY:! and Y:$ are the sets that consist, respectively, of\n\u000f all Y \u0012 X of type fp! q;:ag [ C(p) where a 2 C(q)nC(p);\n\u000f all Y \u0012 X of type fp$ q;:ag[C(p) or fq $ p;:ag[C(p) where a 2 C(q)nC(p);\n\u000f all Y \u0012 X of type f:(p ! q)g [ fps : s 2 Sg where S 2 Xp!q and 8s 2 S\nps 2 fp! s; p$ s; s$ pg;\n\u000f all Y \u0012 X of type f:(p $ q)g [ fps : s 2 Sg [ fqs : s 2 S0g where S 2 Xp!q,\n8s 2 S ps 2 fp ! s; p $ s; s $ pg, S0 2 Xq!p, 8s 2 S0 qs 2 fq ! s; q $\ns; s $ qg, and the sets fps : s 2 Sg, fqs : s 2 S0g are either each disjoint\nwith fp $ q; q $ pg or each equal to fq $ pg (the latter is only possible if\nS = fqg&S0 = fpg; the former holds automatically if S 6= fqg&S0 6= fpg as\nthen q =2 S&p =2 S0).\n(The set Xp!q in the last two bullet points was de\u0085ned in Section 6.)\nLemma 9 For Y as de\u0085ned above, Y \u0012MI.\nProof. Let Y be as speci\u0085ed. Consider any Y 2 Y. I show that Y 2MI by going\nthrough the four possible cases.\n1. Let Y 2 Y!, i.e. Y = fp ! q;:ag [ C(p) where a 2 C(q)nC(p). Y is\ninconsistent because, by C(p) \u000f p and fp ! q; pg \u000f q, we have fp ! qg [ C(p) \u000f q.\n32\nMoreover, for any y 2 Y , the consistency of Y nfyg can be checked by \u0085nding an\ninterpretation with a world w in which all z 2 Y nfyg hold. Speci\u0085cally, fp! qg[C(p)\nis consistent: let all atomic propositions hold in w and in all other worlds; f:ag[C(p)\nis consistent: let all atomic propositions except a hold in w; and, for any y 2 C(p),\nfp ! q;:ag [ C(p)nfyg is consistent: let the only atomic propositions true in w be\nthose in C(p)nfyg, and put fp(w) = ; (which is allowed as p fails in w).\n2. If Y 2 Y$ then Y 2MI by a proof similar to that under 1.\n3. Now let Y 2 Y:!, say (in the earlier notation) Y = f:(p! q)g[ fps : s 2 Sg.\nWe have fps : s 2 Sgp = S 2 Xp!q, whence by Lemma 7 fps : s 2 Sg \u000f p ! q.\nSo Y is inconsistent. To check minimal inconsistency, consider any Z ( Y . If\n:(p ! q) =2 Z, Z is consistent, as seen from an interpretation such that all atomic\npropositions hold in all worlds. If :(p ! q) 2 Z, then Z = f:p ! q)g [ R\u0003 with\nR\u0003 = fps : s 2 S\u0003g and S\u0003 ( S. Note that R\u0003p = S\u0003. So R\u0003p ( S. This and\nS 2 Xp!q imply that C(q)nC(p) * [s2R\u0003pC(s)g, whence by Lemma 7 R\u0003 2 p! q. So\nZ (= f:p! q)g [R\u0003) is consistent.\n4. Finally, let Y 2 Y:$, say (in the earlier notation) Y = f:(p $ q)g [ fps :\ns 2 Sg [ fqs : s 2 S0g. It can be shown like under 3 that fps : s 2 Sg \u000f p ! q and\nfqs : s 2 S0g \u000f q ! p. So fps : s 2 Sg[fqs : s 2 S0g \u000f p$ q. Hence Y is inconsistent.\nNow consider any Z ( Y . If :(p$ q) =2 Z, Y is consistent by an argument like in case\n3. If :(p$ q) 2 Z, then Z = f:(p$ q)g[R\u0003 with R\u0003 = fps : s 2 S\u0003g[fqs : s 2 S0\u0003g\nand S\u0003 \u0012 S, S0\u0003 \u0012 S0, where S\u0003 ( S or S0\u0003 ( S0. Note that R\u0003p = S\u0003 and R\u0003q = S0\u0003.\nSo R\u0003p ( S or R\u0003q ( S0. Hence R\u0003 2 p ! q or R\u0003 2 q ! p, by an argument like that\nunder 3. So R\u0003 2 p$ q. Hence Z (= f:(p$ q)g [R\u0003) is consistent. \u0004\nLemma 10 For < and Y as de\u0085ned above, IR\u0003< \u0012 Y.\nProof. Let < and Y (= Y! [ Y$ [ Y:! [ Y:$) be as speci\u0085ed. Consider a\nY 2 IR\u0003<. I show that Y 2 Y. I will use that Y 2MI by Lemma 4, and that (*) Y\ncontains no pair t;:t by non-triviality.\nCase 1 : Y \\ R: = ;. Then (i) Y has a subset of type fp ! qg [ C(p), or (ii)\nY has a subset of type fp $ qg [ C(p) or fq $ pg [ C(p). Otherwise Y would\nbe consistent, as seen from an interpretation with a world w in which the only true\natomic propositions are those in Y and such that ft(w) = ; if t 2 L is false in w: in\nw, all y 2 Y \\ \u0016A hold by construction (and by (*)), all p! q 2 Y hold by fp(w) = ;\n(as p is false by not-(i)), all p $ q 2 Y hold by fp(w) = fq(w) = ; (as p and q are\nfalse by not-(ii)), and there are no y 2 Y \\R:.\nSubcase 1a: (i) holds, say fp ! qg [ C(p) \u0012 Y . I show that Y 2 Y!. If\nthere is an a 2 C(q)nC(p) with :a 2 Y , then fp ! q;:ag [ C(p) \u0012 Y , hence\nfp ! q;:ag [ C(p) = Y (as Y 2 MI), and so Y 2 Y!. Hence it su\u00a2 ces to prove\nthat such an a exists. For a contradiction, suppose (**) :a =2 Y for all a 2 C(q)nC(p).\nI show that Y is reducible to Z := Y [ C(q)nfp ! qg, a contradiction. First, Z is\nindeed inconsistent: otherwise there would exist an interpretation with a world w in\nwhich all z 2 Z hold, where by Z\\R: = ; we may assume w.l.o.g. that fp(w) contains\nno world other than w; thus p! q also holds in w, so that Z [ fp! qg = Y [ C(q)\nis consistent, a contradiction. Second, we have Z < Y by jZ \\ \u0016Rj = jY \\ \u0016Rj\u0000 1 (and\nby our lexicographic de\u0085nition of <). Finally, any y 2 ZnY belongs to C(q), hence is\nentailed by Z := C(p) [ fp ! qg (\u0012 Y ); it remains to show Z [ f:yg < Y , which I\ndo by proving that j(Z [ f:ygj \\ \u0016Rj < jY \\ \u0016Rj, i.e. that jY \\ \u0016Rj > 1. Suppose the\n33\ncontrary. Then Y = fp ! qg [ C(p) [ Y 0 for some Y 0 \u0012 \u0016A. By Y 2 MI, C(p) [ Y 0\nis consistent. So there is an interpretation with a world w in which all a 2 C(p) [ Y 0\nhold, where by C(p) [ Y 0 \u0012 \u0016A we may assume w.l.o.g. that fp(p) contains no world\nother than w, and that all a 2 A with :a =2 Y hold in w. All a 2 C(q) satisfy :a =2 Y :\nif a 2 C(q)nC(p) by (**), and if a 2 C(q) \\ C(p) by (*). So, in w, all a 2 C(q) and\nhence q hold; so p ! q holds. But then all y 2 Y hold in w, contradicting Y \u0092s\ninconsistency.\nSubcase 1b: (ii) holds, say fp$ qg [C(p) \u0012 Y (the proof is analogous if p$ q is\nreplaced by q $ p). To show that Y 2 Y$, it su\u00a2 ces to slightly adapt the proof in\nSubcase 1a: replace \u0093!\u0094by \u0093$\u0094, and in both interpretations assume w.l.o.g. that\nfq(w) (in addition to fp(w)) contains no world other than w.\nCase 2 : Y \\R: 6= ;. Then Y nR: ( Y , whence Y nR: is consistent by Y 2MI.\nSo by Lemma 8 Y contains a :r 2 R: such that Y \\R \u000f r. Let R := Y \\R. As Y\nis minimal inconsistent, Y = f:rg [R. I consider two subcases.\nSubcase 2a: r is an implication p ! q. I show that Y 2 Y:!. As Y = f:(p !\nq)g [ R 2 MI, R is minimal subject to entailing p ! q. So, by Lemma 7, R is\nminimal subject to C(q)nC(p) \u0012\n[\ns2Rp\nC(s). This implies that Rp 2 Xp!q and\nthat R = fps : s 2 Rpg for some ps 2 fp ! s; p $ s; s $ pg, s 2 Rp. So Y\n(= f:(p! q)g [R) is in Y:!.\nSubcase 2b: r is an bi-implication p$ q. I show Y 2 Y:$. Write R = R1[R2[T\nwith R1 := R\\fp! s; p$ s; s$ p : s 2 Lg, R2 := R\\fq ! s; q $ s; s$ q : s 2 Lg\nand T := Rn(Xp[Xq). As Y = f:(p$ q)g[R is minimal inconsistent, R is minimal\nsubject to entailing p$ q, i.e. minimal subject to entailing each of p! q and q ! p.\nSo, by Lemma 7 and using that Rp = R1p and Rq = R\n2\nq , the set R is minimal subject\nto satisfying both (a) C(q)nC(p) \u0012\n[\ns2R1p\nC(s) and (b) C(p)nC(q) \u0012\n[\ns2R2q\nC(s). It\nfollows that R = R1 [R2 (i.e. T = ;).\nFirst suppose q $ p 2 R1 or q $ p 2 R2. Then Y = f:(p $ q)g [ R \u0013 f:(p $\nq); q $ pg, hence by minimal inconsistency Y = f:(p$ q); q $ pg. So Y 2 Y:$, as\ndesired.\nNow suppose q $ p =2 R1 and q $ p =2 R2. As also p $ q =2 R1 and p $ q =2 R2\nby (*), we have R1 \\R2 = ;. This and the fact that the set Y = R1 [R2 is minimal\nsubject to (a)&(b) imply that R1 is minimal subject to (a) and that R2 is minimal\nsubject to (b). So (like in Subcase 2a) R1p 2 Xp!q with R1 = fps : s 2 Rpg for some\nps 2 fp ! s; p $ s; s $ pg, s 2 Rp, and R2q 2 Xq!p with R2 = fqs : s 2 Rqg for\nsome qs 2 fq ! s; q $ s; s$ qg, s 2 Rq. So Y (= f:(p! q)g [R1 [R2) is in Y:$,\nas desired. \u0004\nBy Lemmas 9 and 10, we can apply Corollary 5 to characterise consistent quota\nrules. I \u0085nally prove that this characterisation can be simpli\u0085ed into that in Theorem\n2.\nProof of Theorem 2. Let F(mp)p2X+ be a quota rule, and Y, Y!;Y$, Y:!, Y:$\nthe sets de\u0085ned above. By Corollary 5 (using Lemmas 6; 9 and 10) I have to show\nthat (a)&(b) hold i\u00a4 for all Y 2 Y (= Y! [ Y$ [ Y:! [ Y:$)X\ny2Y\n(n\u0000my) < n. (21)\n34\nI will build up this equivalence in the following four steps.\nClaim 1. The LHS inequalities in (a) hold i\u00a4 (21) holds for all Y 2 Y!.\nClaim 2. Given (b), the RHS inequalities in (a) hold i\u00a4 (21) holds for all Y 2 Y:!.\nClaim 3. (b) holds i\u00a4 (21) holds for all Y 2 Y$.\nBy Claims 1-3, (a)&(b) hold i\u00a4 (21) holds for all Y 2 Y! [ Y$ [ Y:!; which is\nthe case i\u00a4 (21) holds for all Y 2 Y! [ Y$ [ Y:! [ Y:$, because of our last claim\nwhich completes the proof.\nClaim 4. If (21) holds for all Y 2 Y! [ Y$ then it holds for all Y 2 Y:$ (hence\nthe inequalities for Y 2 Y:$ are redundant in the system).\nProof of Claim 1. The inequalities (21) for all Y 2 Y! are given by\n(n\u0000m:a) + (n\u0000mp!q) +\nX\na02C(p)\n(n\u0000ma0) < n 8p! q 2 X 8a 2 C(q)nC(p).\nUsing that n\u0000m:a = ma \u0000 1, these inequalities can be rewritten as\nma +\nX\na02C(p)\n(n\u0000ma0) \u0014 mp!q 8p! q 2 X 8a 2 C(q)nC(p),\nwhich by taking the maximum over a is equivalent to the LHS inequalities in (a).\nProof of Claim 2. Suppose (b). The inequalities (21) for all Y 2 Y:! are given\nby\nn\u0000m:(p!q) +\nX\ns2S\n(n\u0000mps) < n 8p! q 2 X 8S 2 Xp!q8(ps)s2S 2 (fp! s; p$ s; s$ pg \\X)S .\nThese inequalities can (by n\u0000m:(p!q) = mp!q \u0000 1) be rewritten as\nmp!q +\nX\ns2S\n(n\u0000mps) \u0014 n 8p! q 2 X 8S 2 Xp!q8(ps)s2S 2 (fp! s; p$ s; s$ pg \\X)S ,\nor equivalently as\nmp!q + max\n(ps)s2S2(fp!s;p$s;s$pg\\X)S\nX\ns2S\n(n\u0000mps) \u0014 n 8p! q 2 X 8S 2 Xp!q. (22)\nNote that\nmax\n(ps)s2S2(fp!s;p$s;s$pg\\X)S\nX\ns2S\n(n\u0000mps) =\nX\ns2S\n(n\u0000 min\nps2fp!s;p$s;s$pg\\X\nmps). (23)\nFor all s 2 S and all ps 2 fp$ q; q $ pg we have mps = n by (b). So, for all s 2 S,\nminps2fp!s;p$s;s$pg\\X mps is n if p ! s =2 X and mp!s if p ! s 2 X. Hence in\n(23) the term (n \u0000 minps2fp!s;p$s;s$pg\\X mps) drops out if p ! s =2 X and equals\n(n\u0000mp!s) if p! s 2 X. Therefore (23) implies\nmax\n(ps)s2S2(fp!s;p$s;s$pg\\X)S\nX\ns2S\n(n\u0000mps) =\nX\ns2S:p!s2X\n(n\u0000mp!s).\nUsing this, the inequalities (22) are equivalent to\nmp!q +\nX\ns2S:p!s2X\n(n\u0000mp!s) \u0014 n 8p! q 2 X 8S 2 Xp!q,\n35\nand hence, as desired, to\nmp!q + max\nS2Xp!q\nX\ns2S:p!s2X\n(n\u0000mp!s) \u0014 n 8p! q 2 X.\nProof of Claim 3. 1. First assume (21) holds for all Y 2 Y$, and let p$ q 2 X.\n1.1. Here I showmp$q = n. As p$ q is non-degenerate, there exist a 2 C(p)nC(q)\nand b 2 C(q)nC(p). By assumption,\n(n\u0000mp$q) + (n\u0000m:b) +\nX\na02C(p)\n(n\u0000ma0) < n,\n(n\u0000mp$q) + (n\u0000m:a) +\nX\nb02C(q)\n(n\u0000mb0) < n.\nRewriting this (by using that n\u0000m:s = ms \u0000 1 for all s 2 X), we obtain\nmp$q \u0000mb + 1 >\nX\na02C(p)\n(n\u0000ma0) \u0015 n\u0000ma, (24)\nmp$q \u0000ma + 1 >\nX\nb02C(q)\n(n\u0000mb0) \u0015 n\u0000mb.\nSo\nmp$q \u0015 n\u0000ma +mb and mp$q \u0015 n\u0000mb +ma. (25)\nAdding both inequalities, we get 2mp$q \u0015 2n, whence mp$q = n.\n1.2. Next I show that all a 2 C(p)\u0001C(q) have the same threshold. As C(p)\u0001C(q)\nis the union of the non-empty sets C(p)nC(q) and C(q)n C(p), it is su\u00a2 cient to show\nthat ma = mb for all a 2 C(p)nC(q) and b 2 C(q)nC(p). Consider such a; b. The\nargument in 1.1 yields (25), which by mp$q = n implies ma \u0015 mb and mb \u0015 ma,\nwhence ma = mb.\n1.3. Let m be the common threshold of all a 2 C(p)\u0001C(q). I suppose m < n\nand show that jC(p)\u0001C(q)j \u0014 2. The \u0085rst inequality in (24) (where b 2 C(q)\u0001C(p))\nimplies\nmp$q \u0000mb + 1 >\nX\na02C(p)nC(q)\n(n\u0000ma0),\nwhich after substituting mp$q = n and mb = ma0 = m gives\nn\u0000m \u0015 jC(p)nC(q)j(n\u0000m), i.e. jC(p)nC(q)j \u0014 1.\nIt can be shown similarly that jC(q)nC(p)j \u0014 1. So jC(p)\u0001C(q)j \u0014 2.\n1.4. Finally, let a00 2 C(p)\\C(q). I show that ma00 = n. Let a; b be as in 1.1. The\n\u0085rst inequality in (24) implies\nmp$q \u0000mb + 1 > (n\u0000ma00) + (n\u0000ma),\nwhich by mp$q = n and ma = mb implies 1 > (n\u0000ma00), i.e. ma00 = n.\n2. Conversely, assume (b). Consider any Y 2 Y$, say Y = fr;:ag [ C(p) where\nr 2 fp $ q; q $ pg and a 2 C(q)nC(p), and let me show (21). Using (b) and\nn\u0000m:a = ma \u0000 1, X\ny2Y\n(n\u0000my) = m\u0000 1 + jC(p)nC(q)j(n\u0000m),\n36\nwherem denotes the common threshold of all a0 2 C(p)\u0001C(q). Note that if jC(p)nC(q)j \u0015\n2 then jC(p)\u0001C(q)j \u0015 3, hence m = n. So, as desired,\nX\ny2Y\n(n\u0000my) =\n\u001a\nm\u0000 1 + n\u0000m < n if jC(p)nC(q)j = 1\nn\u0000 1 + 0 < n if jC(p)nC(q)j \u0015 2.\nProof of Claim 4. Suppose (21) holds for all Y 2 Y![Y$. Consider any Y 2 Y:$,\nsay (in the earlier notation) Y = f:(p$ q)g [ fps : s 2 Sg [ fqs : s 2 S0g. To prove\nthe corresponding inequality,\n(n\u0000m:(p$q)) +\nX\ns2S\n(n\u0000mps) +\nX\ns2S0\n(n\u0000mqs) < n,\nI show that mps = n 8s 2 S and that mqs = n 8s 2 S0; in fact, I only show\nthe former as the latter holds analogously. Let s 2 S. Recall that S 2 Xp!q and\nps 2 fp! s; p$ s; s$ pg.\nIf ps 2 fp$ s; s$ pg then already by Claim 3 mps = n, as desired.\nNow assume ps = p! s. Since s 2 S 2 Xp!q, C(q)nC(p) is a subset of [s\u00032SC(s\u0003)\nbut not of [s\u00032SnfsgC(s\u0003). So there is a b 2 C(s)\\C(q)nC(p). Moreover, as p$ q is\nnon-degenerate, there is an a 2 C(p)n C(q). As a; b 2 C(p)\u0001C(q), we have ma = mb\nby Claim 3. Using Claim 1,\nmp!q \u0015\nX\na02C(p)\n(n\u0000ma0) + max\nb02C(q)nC(p)\nmb0 \u0015 n\u0000ma +mb = n,\nwhence mp!q = n, as desired. \u0004\n37\n"}
