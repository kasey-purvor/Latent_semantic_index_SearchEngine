Introduction \nThere is a considerable literature focussing on firm performance attributes and the effects of family \ncontrol on underpricing in Initial Primary Offerings (IPOs) from the initial flotation of shares on stock \nexchanges.  However the overwhelming majority of this is focussed on IPOs within the developed \nmarkets of Europe (Kaserer and Molderhauer, 2008), in North America and Australia (Bartholomeusz \nand Tanewski, 2006) and even the developing markets of Asia such as Taiwan (Filatotchev et al, \n2005) and Thailand (Bertrand et al, 2008) with little if any attention on the North African region.  \nThis region is notable from its proximity to Europe and its having been heavily influenced through \nthe transplantation of French civil code law institutions during the course of the nineteenth century \nwhile having a business environment and political economy largely shaped by Islamic principles \nreinforced by dominant extended family groups and pyramidal ownership (North (1991); Kuran \n(2004)). \n While North African legal and governance systems are modelled on French civil code law \ninstitutions promoting the centralised authority and property rights of the state in preference to those \nof individual minority interests (Hayek, 1960) there are considerable differences with Morocco, \nTunisia and Algeria having benefitted from institutional development occurring in France itself while \nEgypt was somewhat left behind owing to a more recent colonial relationship with the British empire \n(Kuran, 2004).  However institutional development in North Africa is largely unique in having been \nnecessitated through the need to compete with European firms on lucrative trans-Mediterranean trade \nroutes rather and in having benefitted from sizeable European populations rather than from \ninstitutional imposition by an outside and culturally distant colonial metropole (Kuran, 2003).  Thus a \nsecular civil code judiciary passed law through legislative acts and outlining of \u201cbright line rules\u201d on \ncommercial contract resolution (Levine, 2005) arising from a business community that largely \nadheres to traditional Islamic beliefs (Kuran, 2004).  This process of successful adoption and \ntransplantation of civil code institutions into the deeper societal institutional matrix is a critical \ndeterminant in ensuring the commercial competitiveness of the economy (Williamson, 2000).  Given \nthe comparatively weaker protection of property rights in civil code countries as opposed to those \nadhering to common law ((La Porta et al (2000); Beck et al (2003)) and the consequent high private \nbenefits of control and decreased protection of property rights with the dominant underlying Islamic \ncultural traditions favouring extended family networks and partnerships listings on Maghreb stock \nexchanges are typically made up from either former state owned enterprises (SOEs) or family-\ncontrolled small and medium enterprises (SMEs) (El Mehdi (2007); Dahawy (2007)).  This is \nparticularly evident as the traditional forms of organizational entity available to entrepreneurs under \n 3 \nclassical Islamic commercial law were proprietary operations, family ventures and traditional Islamic \npartnerships (Kuran, 2003). \nThe concept of underpricing in the flotation of new stock represents a direct wealth transfer \nfrom the founders and initial shareholders to new external investors (Filatotchev and Bishop, 2002) \nbut its extent can be significantly influenced by the extent of protection of property rights over a \nfinancial security\u201fs entitlements to corporate cash flows, whether these are enshrined in the prevailing \nlegal system (La Porta et al, 1998 henceforth LLSV), or through optimal corporate governance \nmechanisms (La Porta et al, 2000).  However while La Porta et al (1997) first characterised \ndifferences in ownership concentration across countries with those of civil code as opposed to \ncommon law being dominated by insiders with less dispersion LLSV found evidence across a sample \nof 49 countries that property rights and minority investors were best protected in common law \nsystems followed by Scandinavian and German civil codes and least in French civil systems.  As such \ncorporate governance is a set of mechanisms more concerned in the protection of outside investors \nfrom expropriation by corporate insiders (La Porta et al, 2000).  This has a number of implications in \nthe monitoring and surveillance of insiders with a unitary supervisory board structure composed of \nrepresentatives of major shareholders being favoured in civil code countries where legal protection of \nproperty rights is weaker, incentives to expropriate outsiders higher, and participation of minority \ninvestors discouraged (Jensen and Meckling (1976); La Porta et al, 1999; 2000).  Consequently \ngovernance practices such as split boards and separation of the roles of CEO and Chairman as well as \nmore diversified ownership are not common in civil code law countries in contrast to their common \nlaw counterparts (La Porta et al, 2000).  The civil code legal system engenders economic structural \nrigidities where internal and relationship-based forms of finance and associated corporate governance \nsupersede external market-driven forms of finance and firm-governance structures of common law \ncountries (Levine, 2005).  The level of economic rigidity engendered by the legal institutions also \ninfers that market-determined outcomes to firm governance are at best unlikely (Levine, 2005) with \nownership structure being much less likely to adapt to pressures from investors searching for value \ngains as is the case in Germany (Kaserer and Moldenhauer, 2008).  Furthermore this inertia in \nownership is enhanced given the business environment is dominated by large family block-\nshareholders and an often extensive network of family cross-holdings between family groups within \nNorth Africa (Dahawy (2007); El Mehdi (2007)).  As a consequence of these structural rigidities and \nownership characteristics Kaserer and Moldenhauer (2008) assert that the firm performance-\nownership relationship is likely to be less susceptible to endogeneity than in common law countries \nwith legal institutions promoting external finance and well developed financial markets. \n The literature concerning the development of agency theory in the context of family firms is \nlargely divided with proponents advocating benefits of concentrated family ownership on firm value \nand performance (see Fama and Jensen (1983)) and those citing evidence to the contrary such as \n 4 \nClaessens et al (2000).  The literature focussing on the former argument that increased concentration \nof family ownership promotes firm value and performance is largely centred on the propositions of \nincentive alignment and altruism.  Fama and Jensen (1983) first established the incentive alignment \nmotivation of family groups acting as both principals and agents and in so doing reducing agency \ncosts, such as monitoring and governance, through a central alignment of interests towards to the \ncommon welfare and benefit of the family as a whole.  Furthermore Chami (1999) find evidence that \nfamily firms engage in decision-making over longer investment-time horizons than conventional \nshareholders which is in line with the family perceiving the firm itself as an asset for inter-\ngenerational wealth transfer between generations in the same family.  Increased coordination between \nand within family groups with specialisation in particular trades or skills also acts to reduce \ngovernance and monitoring costs (Bartholomeusz and Tanewski, 2006) and act as an incentive for \nfounding families in the transfer of human, social and financial capital between generations \n(McConaughty et al, 2001).  However while many of these factors act in defining the incentive \nalignment in families that leads to reduced monitoring costs they also promote the concept of altruism \nwhich is defined as a phenomenon that occurs when an individual pursues self-interested goals \nattained through the promotion of welfare goals of others (Bergstrom (1995); Becker (1981)).  \nBartholomeusz and Tanewski (2006) cite that this concept of altruism within a family social network \nacts to promote loyalty, communication and longer investment-time horizons in decision-making that \ncollectively act to reduce agency costs.  However there is a literature detailing a contrasting view \nadvocating the concentrated family ownership is detrimental for firm value and increases agency \ncosts (Shleifer and Vishny (1997); Claessens et al (2000)).  While increased ownership and control \ninfer the potential for families to expropriate wealth from other shareholders through excessive \ncompensation (Morck et al, 2000), engagement of wasteful projects and cronyism (Claessens et al, \n2000), and special dividends (Perez-Gonzalez, 2002), there is a heightened possibility of pyramidal \ncontrol facilitating expropriation of wealth to family owned subsidiaries (Anderson et al, 2003).  \nFurthermore Schulze et al (2001) find evidence that family shareholders are able to hold non-family \nshareholders to ransom in the presence of small illiquid financial markets where a forced sale would \nlikely be at a less than fair value as well as in systems with poor protection of property rights where \ninefficient social contracting would be promoted.  As such collectively these issues relate the concept \nof altruism to negative outcomes in terms of the relationship between concentrated family ownership \nand firm value and performance. \n This paper extends the previous research by several ways.  Firstly it extends the study of \nagency costs in family firms by investigating levels of IPO underpricing across North African equity \nmarkets in relation to levels of family ownership concentration, where the structural rigidity \nengendered by civil code law systems infers that endogeneity will likely be less of an issue.  Secondly \nit explores the impact of board size and levels of concentrated family control and ownership in the \n 5 \nboard as opposed to across the entire firm in underpricing.  Finally we look at the determinants of \nfamily ownership itself and the relationship between family ownership levels and that of other major \nblock-shareholder types and firm control factors. \n \n2.  Data \nThis paper represents a comprehensive list of all IPOs undertaken on each of the national stock \nexchanges of the North African region, namely Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia for the period \n2000 and 2009.  This sample period is reflective of the most recent changes in the region\u201fs markets \nand takes into account improvements in corporate governance legislation.  The evidence in Table 1 \nreveals that listing activity is sporadic owing to the smaller size of these markets with large periods of \ninactivity such as between 2000 and 2005 in Egypt and 2000 and 2004 in Morocco.  The smallest of \nthe exchanges, Algeria, has failed to attract any listings since the period immediate following its \ninception in 1999.  Tunisia in contrast has had a very small but steady stream of listings over the \nsample period.  Consequently a total of 63 IPOs are included in the sample period. \nTable 1 \n \nFlotation prospectuses were hand-collected from financial market regulator websites for Algeria and \nfor Morocco while a combination of Thomson Corporation Perfect Information and Al Zawya \ndatabases were used to source Egyptian prospectuses.  Al Zawya database, the national stock \nexchange and direct contact with individual firms were used to source prospectuses for Tunisia.  We \nexclude readmissions and transfers of listings between main and development boards while also \nexcluding demergers, reorganizations and flotations of preferred stock, convertibles, unit and \ninvestment trusts.  Consequently our final sample is composed of 63 IPO firms that floated ordinary \nshares with single class voting rights.  Share prices were obtained from Bloomberg, DataStream and \nAl Zawya as well as direct from the national stock exchange in Algeria.  US$ Exchanges rates were \nobtained from Bloomberg. \n \n3.  Methodology \nThis study is primarily focussed on the elucidation of the relationship between IPO firm underpricing \nand family and firm governance characteristics as well as family and corporate block-shareholder \nownership.  The determinants of family ownership are investigated while the study is extended to \nassess the factors influencing whether the controlling family retains effective management of the firm.  \nHowever a major consideration in the smaller datasets of IPO firms inherent in North Africa is the \neffect of small sample bias on the statistical inference of models used.  Attempts to mitigate these \nconcerns centre on the employment of unbalanced panel OLS models that draw statistical strength \nfrom both longitudinal and cross sectional elements as well as the use of a smaller number of \n 6 \nindependent variables in line with recommendations in Good and Hardin (2009).  The reduction in the \nnumber of independent variables is even more important owing to the presence of missing data in \nsome of the IPO firms that is itself responsible for the small sample sizes encountered in the models.  \nConsequently the effects of small sample bias should be taken into consideration when interpreting \nthe results. \n \n3.1  Underpricing \nInitial returns are used as a measure of underpricing.  Two variants are used, namely that in 2 weeks \nand then 4 weeks following listing on exchange.  This is due to concerns over the severity of \nilliquidity in North Africa\u201fs equity markets causing price-rigidity (Smith, 2005) that in turn would \ninhibit the movement of prices in relation to their ability to reflect order flow and information \n(O\u201fHara, 2003).  In line with Filatotchev and Bishop (2002) underpricing is calculated as the \ndifference between stock price at 2 (or 4) weeks and the issue price divided by the issue price: \n \niiii IssueIssuegCloIR sin      (1) \n \n3.2  Board governance impact on performance \nThe mainstream international corporate governance literature views an IPO as being the first major \n\u201cliquidity event\u201d in the life cycle of fast growing firms when founders and initial investors (corporate \ninsiders) begin the process of realizing the value of their ownership stake in the firm (Brav and \nGompers, 2003).  However the IPO process introduces a number of potential agency conflicts for the \nvarious principal and agent parties involved (Bruton et al, 2009).  Adverse selection and moral hazard \nproblems arise from the asymmetric information between new owners (investors) and incumbent \nmanagers (agents) as there are incentives for the latter to mislead or even worse expropriate the \nformer (Bruton et al (2009); Boulton et al (2009)).  It is this relationship between ownership of large \ncontrolling blocks or family groups and levels of asymmetric information, reflected by the level of \nunderpricing, as well as firm value and performance that has been the subject of considerable \ncontroversy with a strong divide emerging in the literature (Chu, 2009). \nThe divide in the literature concerning the effects of these dominant family groups on \ngovernance and firm performance is highlighted with a considerable body of evidence showing the \ndetrimental effects of altruism and the promotion of family interests over and above those of non-\nfamily members on firm performance while a contrasting body draws on the benefits of incentive \nalignment between principals and agents and a reduction in agency cost thereby boosting firm \nperformance.  Research concerning the former negative association is further divided into \napplications of agency theory concerning the link between concentrated family ownership and \nexpropriation of wealth (Morck et al (1998); Smith and Amoako-Adu (1999)) and an institutional \n 7 \noverlap literature (Chu, 2009) concerning the misalignment between business and family \n\u201cinstitutions\u201d.  Agency theory arguments are commonly centred on the proposition that the identity of \nconcentrated owners is closely linked to their incentive, skill, and objectives in monitoring the firms \nmanagement (Thomsen and Pedersen, 2000).  Furthermore family members acting as shareholders \nand managers are likely to have less well defined or even unclear roles and responsibilities over and \nabove membership of the family social network itself (Kets de Vries, 1993).  The likelihood of family \nmembers having substantial control of cash flow rights combined with their collective altruistic \nmotivations infers that their objectives will be focussed more on the longer term survival and growth \nof the firm rather than profit maximisation for minority and institutional shareholders (Thomsen and \nPedersen, 2000).  Finally concentrated family control acts to shield the firm from disciplinary effects \nof the market for corporate control as there are reduced possibilities for hostile takeovers (Barclay and \nHolderness (1989); Gomez-Mejia (2003)).  The focus of the institutional lens concerns the very \ndifferent sets of norms and social values enshrined in the two very different types of institution, \nnamely that of the business and that of the family (Lansberg, 1983).  Family as an institution places \nmaximum emphasis on the organizational design to maximise resource allocation in accordance with \nsocial ties, personal trust and established loyalties to promote family members (Kepner, 1983).  In \ncontrast the business institution places emphasis on the optimal managerial organizational structure to \npromote firm performance and maximise value for shareholders.  The altruistic nature of families \ninfers that recruitment will primarily occur from within the family itself which is a limited talent pool \n(Andersen and Reed, 2003) and there will be an emphasis on family succession and inheritance \n(Brenes et al, 2006).  These factors are deemed likely to reduce the competitiveness of family firms \nand exert a negative impact on firm performance and shareholder value (Brenes et al (2006); Carney \n(1998)). \n More recently the literature relating concentration of family ownership to enhanced firm \nperformance and value has emerged citing issues such as incentive alignment between principals and \nagents that reduces monitoring costs (Andersen and Reeb, 2003) and the benefits of extended family \nnetworks in internalising markets and reducing transactions costs (Filatotchev and Bishop, 2002).  \nMoreover some of the factors associated in the traditional literature regarding a negative association \nbetween concentrated ownership and performance are seen as inferring positive association such as \nfamily members emphasis on longer term growth and survival of the firm, which is a feature of good \ngovernance, rather than being solely focussed on short-term interests of self-interested shareholders \n(Bruton et al, 2003).  Further evidence relating to the benefits of concentrated family ownership of \nfirms concerns the reinvestment of wealth back into the firm by family members who have their own \npersonal incentives aligned with those of the wider family social network and firm (Andersen and \nReeb, 2003) and considerably fewer moral hazard problems with less asymmetric information than \nnon-family firms (Andersen and Reeb, 2003).  An additional literature strand of agency theory cites \n 8 \nthat control requires information which is costly to acquire (Andersen and Reeb, 2003).  Family \nmembers are often in informational advantageous positions relative to non-family members owing to \nhaving often been in contact with the business since childhood (Kets de Vries, 1993) making the \ncontrol and monitoring of family firms easier than non-family firms (Smith and Amoako-Adu, 1999).  \nThese information advantages held by family shareholders also create advantages in disciplining \npossible opportunistic behaviours by agent-managers and minimizing problems associated with free-\nriding inherent with small individual shareholder (Demsetz and Lehn, 1985).  Burkart et al (2003) \nfind empirical evidence supporting the retained ownership of families which provides these firms \nwith a competitive advantage.  Equally there is evidence of the benefits arising from the sustained \npresence of extended family control and concentrated ownership within firms where from a resource-\nbased perspective these act as intangible and specific resources facilitating long term relations with \nstakeholders such as buyers, employees, suppliers and banks (Poza, 2007).  These extended long term \nfamily orientated relationships reduce transactions costs thereby resulting in better monitoring both \nwithin and between firms (Filatotchev et al, 2005).  This is an especially important benefit of family \ngovernance mechanisms in environments characterised by weak protection of property rights, high \ntransactions costs and considerable transactions costs associated with information collection and \nverification (Filatotchev et al, 2005).  There is also considerable reputational capital at stake with \nfamily firms as these families often have significant social status within the national political \neconomy (DeAngelo and DeAngelo, 2000) which leads to a wider alignment of incentives on a \nprincipal-principal basis where family incentives are aligned with those of broader society and \npolitical motivations (Chu, 2009). \n As such we would expect that the relationships between the size of boards of directors and \nthe degree of independence of boards of directors to have different effects on underpricing between \nfamily and non-family firms.  The enhanced monitoring effect arising from having a separate and \ndistinct independent board of directors supervising the lower executive board would be expected to \nhave a positive impact on underpricing for non-family firms while having a negative effect on \nunderpricing for family firms.  This is intuitively expected as family firms have less incentive to \ncreate split boards in relation to their ability to monitor incumbent managers in relation to the pre-\nexisting family mechanisms for information revelation and disclosure.  As such investors are faced \nwith lower levels of asymmetric information and less underpricing in the context of family firms with \na single tier board structure rather than from non-family firms that have split boards and a lack of the \nfamily-based altruistic mechanisms for disclosure and protection of property rights.  While there are \nlikely differences between the ratio of independent to non-independent directors larger size boards are \nlikely to increase asymmetric information owing to less coordination between principals and agents.  \nConsequently I test the following hypotheses: \n \n 9 \nH-1.1:  Board size is positively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in family firms \n \nH-1.2:  Board size is positively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in non-family firms \n \nH-1.3:  Board independence is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in family firms \n \nH-1.4:  Board independence is positively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in non-family firms \n \nOLS regressions were used to test these hypotheses using unbalanced panels.  This takes the form: \n \niiIPO\niFirmGovernancei\nControlsIPO\nControlsFirmGovernancetConsngUnderprici tan\n   (2) \n \nBoard size is defined as the natural logarithm of the absolute number of directors.  Board \nindependence is the ratio of the number of independent (non-executive) directors to executive \ndirectors.  In the case of supervisory boards then the count of executive directors is the taken as the \nnumber of executive-level senior management detailed in the prospectus. \nWhere governance represents each of the parameters indicated in the hypotheses and Firm \nand IPO controls are introduced from the literature.  Firm-level controls used in each case included \nfirm size, the natural logarithm of tangible assets as expressed in US$, firm age, expressed as the \nnatural logarithm of age, itself defined as the number of years from foundation to IPO (Filatotchev \nand Bishop (2002); Filatotchev et al (2005)).  Equally given debt may have a governance role limiting \nthe level of managerial discretion and mitigating potential agency conflicts (Bruton et al, 2009).  As \nsuch I control for possible effects of debt on IPO valuations in using the total debt-to-total asset ratio.  \nGiven the inclusion of a very wide variety of firms undergoing IPOs ranging from the privatizations \nof very large former state owned enterprises to smaller high growth technology companies with \nconsiderable variation in revenues this is controlled for by the natural logarithm of US$ converted \nrevenues in IPO year.  We introduce IPO-related controls and two specific variables to control for the \nsize of the offering, given the considerable dispersion of amounts raised in IPOs, with the natural \nlogarithm of the ratio of IPO proceeds to total assets and tangible assets respectively, where all values \nare expressed in US$. \n \n3.3  Lead manager effects on IPO firm underpricing \nThe effects of the lead manager on IPO firm underpricing is an under-researched area despite the \nemergence of studies focussing on the roles of underwriters in flotation\u201fs (Boulton et al, 2009).  Lead \nmanagers are of particular significance in civil code and especially in Francophone markets where the \n 10 \nformal role of Chef de File is broader in its remit than the role of lead manager in Anglophone \nmarkets.  Consequently the enhanced reputational effects from the employment of either a market \nleading or foreign Lead Manager is likely to have a significant effect in signalling quality and as such \non decreasing levels of IPO underpricing.  Consequently I test the following hypotheses: \n \nH-2.1:  Lead Manager reputation is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in family firms \n \nH-2.2:  Lead Manager reputation is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in non-family \nfirms \n \nH-2.3:  Presence of Foreign Lead Manager is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in \nfamily firms \n \nH-2.4:  Presence of Foreign Lead Manager is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in \nnon-family firms \n \nOLS regressions were used to test these hypotheses using unbalanced panels.  This takes the form: \n \niiIPO\niFirmLeadi\nControlsIPO\nControlsFirmManagerLeadtConsngUnderprici tan\n   (3) \n \nLead Manager reputation is constructed as the cumulative market share defined as the ratio of total \namount raised by firms with that particular lead manager to the total raised across the market.  This \nconstruction is similar to that for underwriter reputation in studies such as Boulton et al (2009) \nalthough in civil code markets the lead manager, or chef de file frequently has a role responsibilities \nbeyond those of a simple lead manager.  Lead manager foreign is a simple pulse dummy variable \nassuming value 1 if lead manager was foreign and 0 otherwise.  These two lead manager variables \ncontrol for any possible signalling effects to external investors through the selective employment of \nparticular lead managers.  Firm and IPO control variables are defined as in preceding section. \n \n3.4  Business Angel and Private Equity effects on IPO firm underpricing \nThe signalling effects of external business angel and private equity investors in terms of quality and \nthe consequent reduction of asymmetric information between principals and agents has received \nlimited attention in the literature (Chahine et al, 2007).  Leading from the initial research undertaken \nby Chahine et al (2007) I conjecture that the informal relationship-based finance of business angels \nwill cause a reduction in asymmetric information and underpricing owing to business angel finance \n 11 \narising from an extension of family networks within the wider Maghreb economy.  However in \ncontrast to this informal network relationship finance the more formal organised, and often foreign, \nprivate equity and venture capital investment will result in an increase in underpricing (Chahine et al, \n2007).  Consequently I test the following hypotheses: \n \nH-3.1:  The presence of Private Equity is positively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in family \nfirms \n \nH-3.2:  The presence of Private Equity is positively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in non-\nfamily firms \n \nH-3.3:  The presence of Business Angels is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in \nfamily firms \n \nH-3.4:  The presence of Business Angels is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in non-\nfamily firms \n \nOLS regressions were used to test these hypotheses using unbalanced panels.  This takes the form: \n \niiIPO\niFirmInvestori\nControlsIPO\nControlsFirmtypeInvestortConsngUnderprici tan\n   (4) \n \nDichotomous pulse dummy variables, taking value 1 should a condition be satisfied and 0 otherwise, \nare introduced to categorize particular types of investor i.e. whether business angel or private equity\/ \nventure capital.  These involve detailed analysis of the ownership cited in prospectuses and \nsubsequent investigation as to the nature of entities outlined using internet based sources such as \ncorporate web-pages or local market financial regulators.  Firm and IPO controls are as defined in \npreceding sections. \n \n3.5  Family control effects on performance \nThe North African regional business environment as a whole is characterized by a mix of former \nSOEs and SME family-firms that commonly form the backbone of national economies in the \nMaghreb (OECD (2007); Hearn et al (2009)).  Chu (2009) cites evidence of the benefits arising from \nthe overlap of responsibilities between owners and incumbent managers that can lead to streamlines \nand efficient monitoring processes, reduced administrative costs, fast decision-making, investment \nefficiency and longer time horizons for the measurement of firm performance.  A unique \n 12 \ncharacteristic of family-firms is the ability of family members to transcend across the divide between \nowners (principals) and managers (agents) which underlines the governance mechanism in family-\nfirms.  However Poza (2007) argues that this mechanism is only as good as the quality of interaction \nbetween business and family and that this is influenced by the size of the firm.  Furthermore Poza \n(2007) asserts that smaller family firms are better able to maintain the communication interface \nbetween business and family and capture the resulting benefits in terms of improved firm \nperformance, monitoring and reduction in asymmetric information. \n These arguments would suggest that the interface between family and business is critical in \ninformation transmission, monitoring and the exercise of control.  While size affects this relationship, \nthe specific nature of how size affects this relationship is through improved coordination between \nbusiness and family interests leading to better communication within the firm.  As such we extend \nthese arguments in focussing on board structure within family firms: \n \nH-4.1:  The ratio of family members on board of directors to total number of family members \nassociated with firm is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing \n \nH-4.2:  The ratio of family board-member ownership to total family ownership is negative associated \nwith IPO-firm underpricing \n \nOLS regressions were used to test these hypotheses using unbalanced panels.  This takes the form: \n \niiIPO\niFirmFamilyi\nControlsIPO\nControlsFirmConcFamilytConsngUnderprici .tan\n   (5) \n \nFamily concentration is either of the two variables: ratio of family board members to total family \ninvolvement and ratio of family board-level ownership to total family ownership.  The first is a \nsimple ratio of the number of family board-level personnel in relation to the total number of family \nmembers associated with the firm, whether these are shareholders or supervisors and lower-level \nmanagement, with all detailed in prospectus.  The second is constructed from the total shareholdings \nof family board members against the total family ownership, the construction of which is outlined \nabove.  Firm and IPO control variables are as defined in previous sections. \n \n3.6  Determinants of Family ownership \nGiven the importance of family-firms to the North African regional economy and their propensity in \nstock exchange listings it is important to elaborate on the determinants of family ownership.  Levels \nof concentrated family ownership will be more likely determined by the governance structure within \n 13 \nthe firm and intrinsic firm factors (Chu, 2009).  Much of the strength of continued family ownership \nis derived from deep collective knowledge and involvement of the firm which would be otherwise \nlost if outside block-shareholders such as private equity and venture capitalists or business angels \nbecame involved (Kaserer and Moldenhauer, 2008).  Consequently we extend these arguments: \n \nH-5.1:  The ratio of family board members to total family involvement in the firm is negatively \nassociated with family share ownership \n \nH-5.2:  The presence of business angels is negatively associated with family share ownership \n \nH-5.3:  The presence of private equity and venture capitalists is negatively associated with family \nshare ownership \n \nOLS regressions were used to test these hypotheses using unbalanced panels.  This takes the form: \n \niiOwnership\nControlsFirmVariablesi\nOwnership\nControlsFirmVariablestConsOwnershipFamily tan\n  (6) \n \nWhere variables represents the dichotomous pulse dummy variables indicating the retained presence \nof private equity\/ venture capital and business angels.  The ratio of family board members to total \nfamily participation in the firm is defined as number of family board members to total number of \nfamily member involved in the firm.  Firm controls are defined in preceding sections while ownership \nrepresents a set of variables defined as post-IPO executive, non-executive and block-shareholder \nlevels of retained ownership.  These additional ownership control variables are used to counter for \npotential signalling effects post-IPO through the retained ownership by certain insider groups such as \nboard level directors who have considerable oversight over corporate affairs (Filatotchev and Bishop \n(2002); Filtatochev et al (2005)). \n \n3.7  Family and corporate block ownership effects on performance \nThe role of family and corporate block-shareholder ownership and the level of asymmetric \ninformation reflected in underpricing is a source of conjecture in the literature.  There is considerable \nevidence from Boulton et al (2009) and Levine (2005) regarding the continued presence of corporate \ninsiders or block-shareholders in markets with weaker levels of investor protection which is an \ninherent feature of civil code legal regimes.  Similarly there is evidence from the continued presence \nof family ownership in the reduction of asymmetric information and underpricing (Filatotchev et al \n 14 \n(2005); Chu (2009); Kaserer and Moldenhauer (2008)).  As a consequence I test the following \nhypotheses: \n \nH-6.1:  Family ownership is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing in IPO firms \n \nH-6.2:  Corporate block-shareholder ownership is negatively associated with IPO-firm underpricing \nin IPO firms \n \nThe testing of these hypotheses is complicated given the presence of endogeneity issues and the \npotential for reverse causation between levels of family and block-shareholder ownership and \nunderpricing and vice-versa.  However while this is of particular concern in developed markets that \ncommonly adhere to common law the less developed nature of civil code markets and in particular \nthose of the North African nations infers that market-determined outcomes of levels of ownership are \nless likely (Filatotchev et al (2005); Kaserer and Moldenhauer (2008)).  As such the degree of reverse \ncausation and feedback between variables is somewhat mitigated. \nGiven the considerable consternation regarding these endogeneity issues the employment of \ntwo stage least squares (2SLS) techniques using instruments variables is preferable to the standard \nOLS methods.  Two-stage least squares (2SLS) is a special case of instrumental variables regression.  \nThis employs two distinct stages with the first stage finding the portions of the endogenous and \nexogenous variables that can be attributed to the instruments.  This stage involves estimating an OLS \nregression of each variable in the model on the set of instruments.  The second stage is a regression of \nthe original equation, with all of the variables replaced by the fitted values from the first-stage \nregressions.  The coefficients of this regression are the 2SLS estimates.  Firm and Legal control \nvariables are as defined in previous sections.  Three additional instrument variables used are \ndichotomous taking value 1 if condition is satisfied and 0 otherwise.  These are whether price equity\/ \nventure capital is involved, whether the founder is retained on board of directors, and finally whether \nthe lead manager was foreign.  These instruments are justified on justified on basis of low correlations \nwith all other variables. \n \n3.8  Determinants of Family firms \nLastly I study the determinants of family firms and the factors that differentiate family firms from \ntheir non-family counterparts across the Maghreb region. \n Given the North African region is dominated by family firms and an extended network of \nfamily and political ties business angel finance is likely to arise through the extension of family \nnetworks and is more likely to be positively associated with family as opposed to non-family firms \n(Chahine et al, 2007).  However private equity and venture capital which is more formal and often \n 15 \ninvolves foreign firms that are more intrusive in their control and involvement in business affairs are \nless likely to be involved in family firms (Chahine et al, 2007).  Equally I conjecture that firms in \nlarge extractive industries such as mining and oil as well as in technology-related industries such as \ntelecommunications are more likely to be former state owned enterprises rather than family controlled \nfirms.  However financial and manufacturing sector firms are more likely to be family firms given the \nbreadth and diversity of these sectors in extending into microfinance and microcredit services.  This \nresults in the testing of five hypotheses: \n \nH-7.1:  The presence of private equity\/ venture capital is less likely to be associated with family firms \n \nH-7.2:  The presence of business angels is more likely to be associated with family firms \n \nH-7.3:  Family firms are more likely to belong in finance industry \n \nH-7.4:  Family firms are more likely to belong in Manufacturing industry \n \nH-7.5:  Family firms are less likely to belong in Mining and Oil industries \n \nH-7.6:  Family firms are less likely to belong in Technology and Telecommunications industry \n \nThese hypotheses are tested using logistic (Logit) regressions with the dependent variable being \ndichotomous taking the value of 1 for family firms and 0 otherwise.  The Logit regression is of the \nform: \n \niiIPO\nControlsFirmVariablesi\nControlsIPO\nControlsFirmVariablestConsDependent tan\n   (6) \n \nFirm and IPO controls are defined in previous sections.  Dichotomous pulse dummy variables are \nemployed defining a firm belonging within mining and oil, manufacturing, finance and technology \nindustries as well as the presence of foreign private equity\/ venture capitalist and business angel \ninvestors. \n \n4.  Empirical Results \n \n4.1  Descriptive statistics \n 16 \nSummary statistics of IPOs undertaken across North Africa are provided in Table 2.  These reveal that \nthere are considerable differences in the initial returns, otherwise known as underpricing or IPO \ndiscount, between each of the stock markets.  The evidence suggests that the greatest level of \nunderpricing occurs in Tunisia (11.7%) and Egypt (8.8%) with the least in Algeria (1.6%).  However \nthe greatest differential in underpricing occurs between family and non-family controlled firms within \nthe region as a whole.  Levels of underpricing in family firms at 3.2% are substantially lower than \nnon-family firms at 13.6% indicating that the retained presence of family groups acts as a governance \nmechanism in reducing informational asymmetries and associated monitoring costs.  The evidence \nfrom Table 1 also indicates that large proportions of listings are from family-firms.  This is also \nreflective of recent proactive marketing and investor awareness campaigns undertaken by the regions \nstock exchanges in order to attract both a greater number of listings but from a wider section of the \nlocal national economies (Hearn, 2010) \nTable 2 \n \nThe evidence so far suggests that considerable differences exist between national stock markets and \nbetween different groups within the wider Maghreb region.  The evidence from Table 3 largely \nconfirms these differences.  This reveals that the highest number of differences in firm-characteristics \noccurs between Egypt and its North African neighbours of Tunisia and Morocco, while slightly fewer \ndifferences exist between Tunisia and Morocco.  While there are no statistically significant \ndifferences between the costs of equity across the three countries, there are significant differences in \nunderpricing between Tunisia and Morocco.  The most notable difference between the three countries \nis in the level of contract enforcement with judicial process to close contracts taking 410 days in \nEgypt, 240 days in Morocco and least of all 27 days in Tunisia.  These substantial differences in law \nenforcement underline the motivation for the inclusion of a contract\\enforcement variable as a control \nin the later modelling we will employ in this study.  A final notable difference between the three \nmarkets is the significantly lower level of retained founder ownership in Egypt as compared to either \nTunisia or Morocco indicating that the latter markets attract a wider dispersion of firms with more \nbeing characterised as family-controlled SMEs. \n The differences between family and non-family firms are also highlighted in Table 3 where \nthe most significant differences are in levels of underpricing which is considerably greater in non-\nfamily as opposed to family firms.  The differences in firm governance are also pervasive with non-\nfamily firms having significantly lower CEO, Executive and Non-executive director ownership \nindicating less participation of insiders in firm affairs in non-family firms.  Furthermore governance is \nachieved in non-family firms by large corporate block-shareholders which is confirmed from the \nevidence in Table 3 as block-shareholder ownership is statistically significantly higher than in family \nfirms.  These results collectively reveal the differences between the two very different governance \n 17 \nmechanisms employed in institutionally weak markets, namely that involving the employment of \nlarge block-shareholders and that involving concentration of family-ownership. \nTable 3 \n \n4.2  Board governance impact on performance \nThe evidence from the regression results in Table 4 indicates that board size is positively and strongly \nrelated to underpricing with a large coefficient value.  However caution must be exercised in the \ninterpretation of the results owing to constraints caused by small sample sizes although a minimal \nnumber of independent variables have been selected in line with recommendations in Good and \nHardin (2009).  There are critical differences between family and non-family firms with the board \nsize effect in the former being statistically significant at a 5% confidence level this is markedly \nreduced in the latter non-family firms with the effect not being statistically significant in underpricing \nat 2 weeks and only marginally significant at 10% confidence level for underpricing at 4 weeks.  \nThese results would appear to confirm the hypothesized relationships inasmuch that smaller boards \nhave greater interaction and coordination ability between directors and incumbent managers thus \nenhancing information transmission.  However a critical difference between family and non-family \nfirms is that the board size has a considerably greater impact on explanatory power of models in the \nformer type of firm as opposed to the latter.  In contrast to board size the coefficients for board \nindependence are low in value and not statistically significant at any confidence level across family \nand non-family firms as well as underpricing at 2 and 4 weeks.  These latter results regarding board \nindependence are unexpected and largely refute the anticipated relationship with underpricing and \nasymmetric information. \n \n4.3  Lead manager effects on IPO firm underpricing \nThe evidence from Table 4 regarding the impact on underpricing at both 2 and 4 weeks from the \ninclusion of lead managers with dominant market share, or reputation, or those that are foreign \nreveals that while the former has no statistically significant effects on underpricing the latter has a \nlarge negative and statistically significant relationship with underpricing.  This would confirm the \nanticipated signalling of quality effects from an IPO firm\u201fs employment of a foreign lead manager.  \nHowever while the negative sign of the lead manager reputation coefficient is as expected the lack of \nstatistical significance at any confidence level is unexpected.  A further difference between family \nand non-family firms is in the exceptionally high statistical significance of the foreign lead manager \ncoefficient for non-family as opposed to family firms and in the enhanced explanatory power arising \nfrom the inclusion of this variable in the former in contrast to the latter. \n \n4.4  Business Angel and Private Equity effects on IPO firm underpricing \n 18 \nThe evidence from Table 5 reveals that as anticipated the signs of the coefficients for business angels \nand private equity are as expected with the former being negative indicating a net reduction in \nunderpricing while the latter are positive indicating an increase in underpricing.  However there are \ndifferences between family and non-family firms with business angel coefficients being both large in \nabsolute size and statistically significant in the former in contrast to smaller size and no statistical \nsignificance in latter type of firm.  Similarly private equity coefficients are larger and have much \nhigher statistical significance in non-family firms than in family firms where the coefficients lack any \nsignificance.  These results provide support for the enhanced benefits of relationship-based finance \narising from extended family and personal networks involved in family firms while non-family firms \nbenefit from the more traditional formalised finance of private equity and venture capitalists. \n \n4.5  Family control effects on performance \nThe evidence regarding family control effects and their relationship to the reduction of asymmetric \ninformation and underpricing is less clear.  The results in Table 5 would infer that as the ratio of \nfamily board members to total family participation in the firm increases underpricing decreases as \nanticipated.  However this effect lacks statistical significance at confidence levels over 10%.  In \ncontrast to this result the relationship between increased ratios of family board member ownership to \ntotal family ownership actually has a positive relationship with underpricing, although again at no \ndiscernable level of statistical significance.  Although these effects are questionable in significance \nthey would provide some indication that more concentrated ownership by board members in family \nfirms has a detrimental effect on reduction of asymmetric information for investors while \ncontrastingly a higher proportion of family board members without the concentrated ownership may \nhave a positive impact in mitigating asymmetric information and reducing underpricing. \n \n4.6  Determinants of Family ownership \nThe evidence from Table 6 reveals that as anticipated the coefficients for retained business angels, \nprivate equity and the ratio of family board members to total family involvement are negative.  Some \ncaution must be taken in the interpretation of these results owing to effects arising from small samples \nthough this has been minimised in a minimal selection of independent variables in line with Good and \nHardin (2009).  However only the relationship between family ownership and business angels and the \nratio of family board members to total participation are statistically significant at the 0.005% \nconfidence level.  These also have much larger coefficients than that for private equity involvement \nand their inclusion in models causes substantial increases in explanatory power.  As such this is the \nstrongest evidence so far of the impact of extended family and personal networks and relationships on \nthe governance of the family firm.  Increased family concentrated ownership has a negative \nrelationship to increased family presence at board level and equally has a negative relationship with \n 19 \nincreased participation of outside business angel investors.  This would infer that optimal governance \nin family firms may be more dispersed family ownership tied to a greater concentration of family \nmembers at board level.  An unusual finding at this stage is that unlike increased family participation \nat board level and the retention of private equity investors the retention of business angel investors \ncauses a sign change and a dramatic decrease in statistical significance of director (executive and non-\nexecutive) and corporate block-shareholder ownership.  This would imply that the involvement of \nbusiness angels in a family firm is an intrusive mechanism of governance that transcends ownership \nand management at all levels and is more intrusive than either concentrated family board participation \nor the engagement of private equity. \n \n4.7  Family and corporate block ownership effects on performance \nThe evidence from two stage least squares (2SLS) regressions in Table 7 reveals some weak support \nfor the benefits of retained family ownership in mitigating informational asymmetry and reducing \nunderpricing.  The family ownership coefficient is very low in absolute size and as anticipated \nnegative in value for underpricing over 4 weeks at a weak statistical significance of 10% while it is \nnot significant for underpricing over 2 weeks.  The results for retention of corporate block-\nshareholder ownership are unexpected as despite the lack of statistical significance and low size they \nare positive in direction indicating retained block-shareholder ownership acts to increase underpricing.  \nThis is unexpected in a business environment shaped by civil code law institutions (Boulton et al, \n2008) and is likely to be more reflective of a contrast between benefits of family and block-\nshareholder ownership.  As such this would provide some support for the benefits of family \nownership and participation in firms within business environments shaped by poor levels of investor \nprotection and weak institutions. \n \n4.8  Determinants of Family firms \nThe results from the logistic regression in Table 8 reveal that across the Maghreb region family firms \nare less likely to belong to the technology\/ telecommunications industry at a statistical confidence \nlevel of 5% as anticipated.  However while the coefficient for inclusion in the mining\/ oil industry is \nalso negative it is not statistically significant at any discernable confidence level.  The coefficient on \nthe inclusion in finance industry is positive as expected but also lacks statistical significance while \nunexpectedly the coefficient for inclusion in manufacturing industry is negative it also lacks any \ndiscernable statistical significance.  However consideration of firm and IPO control variables \nindicates that levels of debt (or gearing) is likely to be considerable higher in family than non-family \nfirms as are revenues and levels of proceeds raised from issue in relation to total firm assets.  These \nare reflective of significant structural differences in balance sheets of family as opposed to non-family \nfirms. \n 20 \n \n5.  Conclusions \nThis study investigates the performance and characteristics affecting levels of underpricing in a \ncomprehensive sample of IPO firms across the North African region for the period 2000 to 2009.  \nThere are considerable differences in the firm balance sheet, IPO characteristics and levels of \nownership between the three major Maghreb markets of Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco while \nsignificant differences exist between family and non-family firms across the region with underpricing \nbeing much greater in the latter type of firm for both two and four weeks in duration. \n The findings in this study lend support to the concept of enhanced firm governance derived \nfrom deep family involvement within the firm\u201fs organisational structure thus acting to reduce \nmonitoring costs and asymmetric information and consequently underpricing.  However there is a \nstrong disparity between levels of concentrated family ownership at board level and the proportion of \nfamily board participation in relation to total family participation within firm.  While the latter exerts \na largely positive governance effect in reducing underpricing the latter has the opposite effect \nindicating that while concentrated family involvement at board level is beneficial a concentration in \nownership is not.  Consequently a desirable governance feature of family firms would be more \ndispersed ownership that would offer incentives for monitoring while a concentration of family at \nboard level in terms of numbers acts as a device to facilitate the transmission of information.  This is \nintuitive given that the evidence suggests that board size has a considerable positive relationship with \nunderpricing inferring that smaller boards are beneficial in firm coordination and management.  This \nevidence is particularly revealing in terms of the benefits of family control as a viable governance \nmechanism in enhancing minority investor protection given the increasingly competitive environment \nin attracting foreign portfolio and direct investment owing to the recent 2008\/2009 financial crisis and \neconomic downturn. \n The findings also reveal that in both family and non-family firms the employment of a \nforeign lead manager, or Chef de File, exerts a substantial signalling effect of quality that \ndramatically reduces underpricing.  However the evidence does also suggest that business angels are \nbest placed to exert optimal monitoring and surveillance and intrusive management governance in \nfirms in excess of that that could be achieved through the firm\u201fs engagement of formal private equity \nand venture capitalists.  This would provide further support for the networked relationship-based \nfinance mechanisms in business environments that are shaped by poor external investor protection \nand weak institutions.  Overall while the study provides credible and revealing evidence into the \nnature of family firms in North Africa the low level of IPO activity merits the extension of such a \nstudy across the Middle East region. \n \n 21 \nReferences \nAndersen, R.
