S003613990038116X\n1. Introduction. We consider the problem of potential flows with a free surface,\nin the absence of gravity, but with small surface tension. Examples of such flows\n(which we will consider in section 6) include ploughing flows, flow over a submerged\nbody, flow around a corner, gliding or planing flows, and impinging jets. However, for\nmuch of the paper the precise geometry of the flow is unimportant and may be left\nunspecified.\nWe will be concerned with the limit in which the surface tension parameter tends\nto zero. In this limit the problem is a singular perturbation problem, and therefore we\nwould expect the formal asymptotic series developed in powers of the surface tension\nparameter to be divergent. This divergence is associated with the presence of an\nexponentially small correction to the algebraic expansion, which appears \u201cbeyond all\norders\u201d [9].\nKruskal and Segur [14] observed that in nonlinear ordinary differential equations\nthe divergence is associated with a singularity in the analytic continuation of the\nleading-order solution, near which the formal asymptotic series breaks down. They\nformulate an inner problem in the vicinity of the singularity and find that its solution\ncontains a decaying exponential in the far field, in addition to the terms which match\nwith the algebraic series. This exponential is matched to a solution of the linearized\nequation away from the singularity to obtain the exponentially small, beyond all\norders correction. Kruskal and Segur solve the inner problem numerically (observing\nthe exponential along a ray on which the algebraic terms vanished), but other authors\nhave since observed that the far field of the inner solution can be Borel-summed to\nobtain the exponential to be matched to the outer solution (see, for example, [8, 11]).\nA similar method is formulated in [5, 4], where the algebraic asymptotic expan-\nsion (away from the singularity) is optimally truncated (that is, truncated at its least\nterm), which results in an exponentially small error between the truncated series and\n\u2217Received by the editors November 10, 2000; accepted for publication (in revised form) January\n24, 2002; published electronically July 3, 2002.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/siap\/62-6\/38116.html\n\u2020Mathematical Institute, Center for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Oxford University, 24-\n29 St. Giles\u2019, Oxford OX1 3LB, United Kingdom (chapman@maths.ox.ac.uk).\n\u2021School of Mathematics, University of East Anglia, Norwich, England NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom\n(J.Vanden-broeck@uea.ac.uk).\n1872\nEXPONENTIAL ASYMPTOTICS AND CAPILLARY WAVES 1873\nthe exact solution. This allows the exponentially small corrections to be observed\nswitching on across Stokes lines by smoothing the Stokes discontinuity, and is a gen-\neralization of the smoothing of Stokes discontinuities in linear ordinary differential\nequations discovered by Berry [2]. We also note that a general framework for deter-\nmining exponentially small terms in rank-1 ordinary differential equations has been\nrecently given by Costin [6].\nThe exponentially small correction terms which appear in the present problem\ncorrespond to capillary waves on the free surface of exponentially small amplitude.\nWe will find that we are able to determine quite simply the region of the free surface\nthey occupy, as well as their magnitude, even for very general flow geometries. We\nnote that exponentially small gravity-capillary waves have been studied in the context\nof the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation in [1, 3, 10, 17].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we formulate the problem\nmathematically. In section 3 and section 4 we apply the procedure developed in [5].\nIn section 3 we naively expand the solution as a formal power series in the surface\ntension parameter and find the form of the late terms in this series. This enables us, in\nsection 4, to truncate the algebraic series optimally and to observe the subdominant\nexponentials being switched on across Stokes lines. In section 5 we compare the results\nof section 4 with a direct numerical simulation of the full problem for two particular\nflows, namely, flow over a polygonal plough and flow round a right-angled corner. We\nwill find that there is remarkable agreement between the asymptotic and numerical\nresults, even for quite large values of the surface tension parameter. The flow past\na polygonal plough was considered before by Tuck and Vanden-Broeck [16] in the\nabsence of surface tension but with the effect of gravity included.\nIn section 6 we consider the implications of the results of section 4 for many other\nexamples of potential flows with a free surface. Finally, in section 7, we present out\nconclusions.\n2. Formulation of the problem. In the fluid region, we have steady, incom-\npressible, irrotational, inviscid flow, so that the fluid velocity u = (u, v) = \u2207\u03c6, where\nthe velocity potential \u03c6 satisfies\n\u22072\u03c6 = 0.\nOn all boundaries we have the kinematic condition\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202n\n= 0,(2.1)\nwhile on the free boundary we also have the dynamic condition, which from Bernoulli\u2019s\nequation is\n1\n2\n|\u2207\u03c6|2 \u2212 1\n2\n= \u2212\b\u03ba,(2.2)\nwhere the skin speed of the unperturbed free boundary has been normalized to unity,\n\b is the surface tension parameter, and \u03ba is the curvature, positive if the center\nof curvature lies in the fluid region. As usual we define the complex potential by\nw = \u03c6 + i\u03c8, where \u03c8 is the streamfunction (with \u03c8 chosen to be zero on the free\nboundary), and we let z = x+ iy. Since w is then an analytic function of z the map\nz \u2192 w is a conformal transformation of the flow region to a region of the potential\nplane. A second transformation w \u2192 \u03b6 is often used to map this region to the upper\nhalf \u03b6-plane.\n1874 S. J. CHAPMAN AND J.-M. VANDEN-BROECK\nIt is convenient to work in terms of the complex velocity dw\/dz = u\u2212 iv, which\nmay be written as qe\u2212i\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle the streamlines make with the x-axis.\nThe analyticity of qe\u2212i\u03b8 in the upper half \u03b6-plane implies\nlog q = \u2212 1\n\u03c0\n\u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b8(\u03be\u2032) d\u03be\u2032\n\u03be\u2032 \u2212 \u03be ,(2.3)\nwhere \u03b6 = \u03be + i\u03b7, while (2.1) implies that on the free boundary \u03b8 is the angle the\ntangent makes with the x-axis (i.e., the free boundary is a streamline). Then (2.2) is\nq2 \u2212 1 = \u22122\bd\u03b8\nds\n(2.4)\non the free boundary, where s is arclength, increasing in the flow direction, and we\nhave assumed that the fluid region lies to the left of the free boundary as s increases.\nNote that this implies that in the flow region \u03c8 > 0, i.e., that the upper half \u03b6-plane\ncorresponds to a region in the upper half w-plane. Noting that\nd\u03b8\nds\n=\nd\u03b8\nd\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202s\n= q\nd\u03b8\nd\u03c6\nin the potential plane (with q positive on the free boundary), this is\nq2 \u2212 1 = \u22122\bq d\u03b8\nd\u03c6\n.(2.5)\nWe will see in the next section that Stokes lines originate at singularities in the analytic\ncontinuation of \u03b8 and q satisfying (2.3) and (2.5), that is, on the analytic continuation\nof the free boundary. Thus we will consider (2.3) and (2.5) for complex \u03be and \u03c6 and\ncomplex q and \u03b8. Since we are dealing with analytic complex variables z, \u03b6, and\nw anyway, this can lead to some confusion, but this also means that the analytic\ncontinuation is much simpler than in problems with other field equations. Since \u03c6 is\nalready the real part of the analytic variable w, \u03be the real part of the analytic variable\n\u03b6, the complexified \u03c6 can be identified with w and the complexified \u03be can be identified\nwith \u03b6. The difference between the complexified free boundary and the flow region is\nthat on the complexified free boundary q and \u03b8 are not real, even though qe\u2212i\u03b8 is still\nequal to dw\/dz.\nAnalytically continuing (2.3) into the upper half \u03be-plane gives\nlog q \u2212 i\u03b8 = \u2212 1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2032) d\u03b6 \u2032\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 ,(2.6)\nwhere we have replaced \u03be by \u03b6 to emphasize that it is now complex. Similarly, we will\nwrite (2.5) for complex \u03c6 by replacing \u03c6 by w so that\nq2 \u2212 1 = \u22122\bq d\u03b8\ndw\n.(2.7)\nNote that the right-hand side of (2.6) may alternatively be written\n\u2212 1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2032) d\u03b6 \u2032\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 = \u2212\ni\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nlog q(\u03b6 \u2032) d\u03b6 \u2032\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 =\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nlog q(\u03b6 \u2032)\u2212 i\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2032)\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 d\u03b6\n\u2032,\nEXPONENTIAL ASYMPTOTICS AND CAPILLARY WAVES 1875\nsince \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nlog q(\u03b6 \u2032) + i\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2032)\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6 d\u03b6\n\u2032 = 0\nbecause\nlog q(\u03b6 \u2032)\u2212 i\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2032)\n\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b6\u00af\nis analytic in the upper half plane. However, we will use the form (2.6) for the\nremainder of the paper.\nFinally we note that in some of our examples the fluid lies on the right of the free\nboundary for increasing s. In this case (2.7) becomes\nq2 \u2212 1 = 2\bq d\u03b8\ndw\n(2.8)\nand \u03c8 < 0 in the flow; i.e., the upper half \u03b6-plane corresponds to a region in the\nlower half w-plane. This corresponds simply to letting w \u2192 \u2212w, so that the results\nwe obtain are easily translated to this case.\n3. Asymptotic expansion for small surface tension. We will solve (2.6),\n(2.7) asymptotically as \b\u2192 0. The first step in applying the procedure developed in\n[5] is to determine the algebraic expansion in powers of \b, and in particular the form\nof the late terms in this expansion, so that we can truncate it optimally.\n3.1.

In mapping the fluid region to the\nupper half plane the free surface will be mapped to a section of the real axis but not\n1876 S. J. CHAPMAN AND J.-M. VANDEN-BROECK\nto the whole real axis. Fixed boundaries will also be mapped to the real axis, and\non these boundaries \u03b80 is known and has logarithmic singularities. (The existence\nof logarithmic singularities allows the existence of a nonzero solution to (3.3) while\nnot invalidating (2.3).) Thus when the geometry is specified (3.3) will state that an\nintegral of \u03b80 over part of the real line is equal to a known right-hand side. See, for\nexample, (5.6).\nIn order to truncate the series (3.1) optimally we need to know the behavior of\nthe late terms in the expansion; i.e., we need to solve (3.7) and (3.8) as n\u2192\u221e. The\nomitted terms in (3.7), (3.8) can readily be calculated (they arise from expanding the\nlog in (2.6) and the products in (2.7)), but we will see that they are all of lower order\nin n for large n.\nNow, in the leading-order problem \u03b80 may have singularities as a function of w\n(through the conformal map \u03b6). However, all higher-order problems are linear and\ncan therefore introduce no new singularities in \u03b8. Thus the singular points of \u03b8n(w)\nmust be the same as those of \u03b80(w) for all n. The singular perturbation in (2.7) means\nthat to determine each successive term in the expansion we differentiate the previous\nterm. Thus, if \u03b8n has a singularity of the form 1\/(w \u2212 w0)n, then \u03b8n+1 will have a\nsingularity of the form n\/(w \u2212 w0)n+1. Thus as n \u2192 \u221e we expect the asymptotic\nexpansions (3.1) to exhibit factorial\/power divergence, so that we make the ansatz\n\u03b8n \u223c \u0398\u0393(n+ \u03b3)\n\u03c7n+\u03b3\n, qn \u223c Q\u0393(n+ \u03b3)\n\u03c7n+\u03b3\nas n\u2192\u221e,(3.9)\nwhere \u03c7, \u03b3, \u0398, and Q are functions of w but are independent of n. We will find\nthat the terms on the left-hand side of (3.8) exponentially dominate those on the\nright-hand side as n\u2192\u221e, so that\nqn \u223c i\u03b8n + qn\u22121q1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 as n\u2192\u221e.(3.10)\nThen at leading order in (3.7) using (3.10) and the ansatz (3.9) we have\nd\u03c7\ndw\n= i,\nso that\n\u03c7 = iw + constant.\nSince the singularities of \u03b8n are the same as those of \u03b80 we know that \u03c7 must vanish\nat one of these singularities. In general the late terms will be a sum of terms such\nas (3.9), one centered on each singularity of \u03b80. On the free boundary (i.e., for real\nw) this sum is dominated by those singularities closest to the real axis (i.e., with the\nsmallest value of \u03c8). Denote by w0 the closest singularity to the real axis in the upper\nhalf w-plane (since we are in the upper half \u03b6-plane). Then\n\u03c7 = i(w \u2212 w0).(3.11)\nAt order logn\/n in (3.7) we find d\u03b3\/dw = 0, so that \u03b3 is in fact a constant. At order\n1\/n we find\ni\u0398q1 + i\u0398q1 = \u2212d\u0398\ndw\n+ q1\u0398\u03c7\n\u2032 \u2212 i\u0398d\u03b80\ndw\n,\nEXPONENTIAL ASYMPTOTICS AND CAPILLARY WAVES 1877\ni.e.,\nd\u0398\ndw\n= \u2212i\u0398\n(\nq1 +\nd\u03b80\ndw\n)\n= 0,\nby (3.4). Hence \u0398 = constant = \u039b, say.\nIn summary we have\n\u03b8n \u223c \u039b\u0393(n+ \u03b3)\n(i(w \u2212 w0))n+\u03b3 , qn \u223c\ni\u039b\u0393(n+ \u03b3)\n(i(w \u2212 w0))n+\u03b3 as n\u2192\u221e.(3.12)\nTo determine \u03b3 we need to examine the order of the singularity in \u03b80 as w \u2192 w0,\nwhich we will do in section 3.2. To determine \u039b we must match with an inner region\nin the vicinity of w0, which we will do in section 3.3.\n3.2. Inner limit of \u03b80. To determine \u03b3 we need to examine the order of the\nsingularity in \u03b80 as w \u2192 w0. This will depend on the type of singularity in the flow\nfield. Typical singularities include stagnation points, sources, sinks, and flow around\nthe corner of an obstacle.\nFor stagnation points and flow around corners, locally in the vicinity of the sin-\ngularity we have w \u2212 w0 = const.\u00d7 (z \u2212 z0)k for some k \n= 1. For a stagnation point\ngenerically k = 2, while for flow around a corner k = \u03c0\/\u03b2, where \u03b2 is the interior\n(i.e., in the fluid) angle of the corner. Then, for the corresponding singularity on the\nanalytic continuation of the free boundary\ndw\ndz\n= q0e\n\u2212i\u03b80 = e\u2212i\u03b80 = const.\u00d7 (z \u2212 z0)k\u22121 = const.\u00d7 (w \u2212 w0)(k\u22121)\/k,\nremembering that q0 = 1 on the free boundary. Hence\n\u03b80 \u223c i (k \u2212 1)\nk\nlog(w \u2212 w0),(3.13)\nas w \u2192 w0. For (3.13) to be compatible with (3.12) we must have \u03b3 = 0, giving\n\u03b8n \u223c \u039b\u0393(n)\n(i(w \u2212 w0))n , qn \u223c\ni\u039b\u0393(n)\n(i(w \u2212 w0))n as n\u2192\u221e.(3.14)\nFor sources and sinks w \u2212 w0 = const.\u00d7 log(z \u2212 z0). In that case\ndw\ndz\n= q0e\n\u2212i\u03b80 = e\u2212i\u03b80 = const.\u00d7 (z \u2212 z0)\u22121 = const.\u00d7 e\u2212(w\u2212w0).\nHence\n\u03b80 \u223c \u2212i(w \u2212 w0)(3.15)\nas w \u2192 w0, and in this case there is no singularity in \u03b80 and no associated Stokes\nlines.\n3.3. Inner expansion in the vicinity of the complex singularity. Now in\nthe vicinity of the singularity in the complex plane log q\u2212 i\u03b8 is equal to the (regular)\nexpansion of the right-hand side of (2.6), which is evaluated on the real axis, and\ntherefore involves the outer expansion of q and \u03b8 away from the singularity. But we\nknow that inserting the expansions for q and \u03b8 into the right-hand side simply gives\n1878 S. J. CHAPMAN AND J.-M. VANDEN-BROECK\nthe outer expansion of log q \u2212 i\u03b8. The right-hand side of this equation in the inner\nregion is therefore simply the inner limit of log q \u2212 i\u03b8. Hence, since q0 = 1 and\n\u03b80 \u223c i\u03b1 log(w \u2212 w0) + constant + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nin the vicinity of w0, where \u03b1 = (k \u2212 1)\/k, we have\nlog q \u2212 i\u03b8 \u223c \u03b1 log(w \u2212 w0) + constant + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(3.16)\n\u22122\bq d\u03b8\ndw\n= q2 \u2212 1.(3.17)\nWe define the inner variable \u03b7 by w = w0 \u2212 \bi\u03b7.

Exact solution of the inner problem. In fact, since (3.18) is a Riccati\nequation we can solve it exactly and determine \u039b analytically.

The next step is to optimally truncate the expansion and examine the switching\non of exponentially small terms across Stokes lines.\n4. Stokes line smoothing. We keep the analysis here brief since it is similar\nto that in [5].

J. CHAPMAN AND J.-M. VANDEN-BROECK\nas N \u2192\u221e and \b\u2192 0. The homogeneous version of this equation has a solution\nRN \u223c e\u2212iw\/\f,(4.2)\ncorresponding to capillary waves on the free surface. Following Dingle [9] we expect\nthere to be Stokes lines whenever successive terms in the expansion of \u03b8 have the same\nphase, i.e., when \u03c7 is real and positive, so that w \u2212 w0 is negative imaginary. Hence\nthere will be Stokes lines down parallel to the imaginary axis from the singularities\nin the upper half w-plane. We will show that a multiple of (4.2) is switched on across\nthese Stokes lines. We define the Stokes multiplier A by setting\nRN = Ae\n\u2212iw\/\f,\ngiving\n\be\u2212iw\/\f\ndA\ndw\n\u223c i\bN\u03b8N \u223c i\b\nN\u039b\u0393(N)\n(i(w \u2212 w0))N .(4.3)\nNow the right-hand side of (4.3) is minimal for N \u223c |w \u2212 w0|\/\b. Hence we let\nN = |w \u2212 w0|\/\b+ \u03c1, where \u03c1 is bounded as \b \u2192 0. Then, since N is a function of\n|w \u2212 w0| only, following [5, 15] we write w \u2212 w0 = \u2212irei\u03d1 and write\nd\ndw\n=\ne\u2212i\u03d1\nr\nd\nd\u03d1\n.\nThen, as \b\u2192 0,\n\be\u2212re\ni\u03d1\/\f e\n\u2212i\u03d1\nr\ndA\nd\u03d1\n\u223c i\b\nN\u039b\n\u221a\n2\u03c0e\u2212NNN\u22121\/2\nrNeiN\u03d1\n=\ni\b(r\/\f+\u03c1)\u039b\n\u221a\n2\u03c0e\u2212(r\/\f+\u03c1)(r\/\b+ \u03c1)(r\/\f+\u03c1\u22121\/2)\nr(r\/\f+\u03c1)ei\u03d1(r\/\f+\u03c1)\n\u223c i\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u039b\b1\/2e\u2212r\/\f\nr1\/2ei\u03d1(r\/\f+\u03c1)\n.\nHence\ndA\nd\u03d1\n\u223c i\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u039br1\/2ei\u03d1e\u2212r\/\fere\ni\u03d1\/\f\n\b1\/2ei\u03d1(r\/\f+\u03c1)\n.\nNow, the right-hand side is exponentially small except near the Stokes line \u03d1 = 0.\nThus there is a rapid variation in A at this point, corresponding to the switching on\nof our subdominant exponential. To examine this transition we introduce the local\nscaling \u03d1 = \u03b4\u03d1\u00af, giving\ndA\nd\u03d1\u00af\n\u223c i\u03b4\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u039br1\/2e\u2212r\u03b4\n2\u03d1\u00af2\/(2\f)\n\b1\/2\n.\nWe see that the correct scaling is \u03b4 = \b1\/2, giving\ndA\nd\u03d1\u00af\n\u223c i\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u039br1\/2e\u2212r\u03d1\u00af\n2\/2.\nHence\nA = a+ i\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\u039b\n\u222b \u03d1\u00af\u221ar\n\u2212\u221e\ne\u2212t\n2\/2 dt,\nEXPONENTIAL ASYMPTOTICS AND CAPILLARY WAVES 1881\nand we have the usual error function smoothing of the Stokes discontinuity [2]. Match-\ning with the outer solution away from the Stokes line we find there is a jump in A\ngiven by\nA(\u03d1 = 0\u2212)\u2212A(\u03d1 = 0+) = 2\u03c0i\u039b.(4.4)\nIn summary, there are Stokes lines down parallel to the imaginary axis from\nsingularities in the upper half w-plane across which\n2\u03c0i\u039bexp\n(\n\u2212 i(w \u2212 w0)\n\b\n)\n(4.5)\nis switched on. Throughout we have been working in the upper half \u03b6-plane, corre-\nsponding to the upper half w-plane. If we were to instead analytically continue into\nthe lower half \u03b6-plane, we would find that there are Stokes lines up parallel to the\nimaginary axis from singularities in the lower half w-plane. Since the singularities off\nthe real axis appear in complex conjugate pairs, and since we know that the solu-\ntion on the real axis must be real, we find that where the Stokes lines meet the free\nboundary (4.5) plus its complex conjugate must be turned on.\nCombining this with our expression (3.24) for \u039b we find that if w0 = \u03c60 + i\u03c80,\nthen the capillary waves turned on across the Stokes line are given by\nRN \u223c 8 sin\n(\u03c0\u03b1\n2\n)\ne\u2212\u03c80\/\f cos\n(\n(\u03c6\u2212 \u03c60)\n\b\n)\n.\nThis expression gives the oscillations in \u03b8, the angle the tangent to the free surface\nmakes with the x-axis. If we are interested instead in the height of the waves, then\nwe need to integrate with respect to \u03c6 to give\n8\b sin\n(\u03c0\u03b1\n2\n)\ne\u2212\u03c80\/\f sin\n(\n(\u03c6\u2212 \u03c60)\n\b\n)\n.\nThus the amplitude of the capillary waves generated is\n8\b sin(\u03c0\u03b1\/2)e\u2212\u03c80\/\f.(4.6)\nBefore we go on to consider some specific examples of flows, we make some general\ncomments about the results so far and formula (4.6). First, we note that the strength\nof the exponential factor in the amplitude is determined by the difference in the value\nof the streamfunction on the free boundary and at the singularity (since we have set\n\u03c8 = 0 on the free boundary), which is the flux of fluid between the two streamlines.\nThe nearer the submerged singularities are to the free boundary the stronger the\ncapillary waves will be. If there are two singularities with different values of \u03c8, the\nwaves generated by the closer one will exponentially dominate those generated by the\nfarther one.\nSecond, we note that the Stokes lines, given by i(w \u2212 w0) real and positive,\ncorrespond to constant real part of w\u2212w0; i.e., the Stokes line meets the free boundary\nat the point where the equipotential from the singularity in the flow meets the free\nboundary.\nThus we are able to say a lot about the capillary waves on the free surface even\nwhen we know very little about the unperturbed flow. In the next section we consider\na specific flow and compare our asymptotic results to a direct numerical simulation\nof the full problem. Then, in section 6, we consider some more general examples of\npotential flows.\n1882 S. J. CHAPMAN AND J.-M.

VANDEN-BROECK\nThe relevant singularities in \u03b80 from the point of view of capillary waves are the\nstagnation point \u03b6 = \u22121 and the corner \u03b6 = \u2212a; it is clear from Figure 1 that the\nequipotential from the corner \u03b6 = \u2212b0 does not meet the free boundary. For the\nstagnation point w0 = 1+ i\u03c0, k = 2, \u03b1 = 1\/2, while for the corner w0 = a\u2212 log a+ i\u03c0,\nk = 2\/3, \u03b1 = \u22121\/2. Since our analysis gives only the jump in the amplitude of\ncapillary waves on the free surface, to compare with numerical results we impose\nthat there are no capillary waves far upstream and examine the behavior of the free\nsurface far downstream. Then the capillary waves present as s\u2192\u221e are given by the\nsuperposition of those generated at each Stokes line, namely,\n\u03b8 \u223c \u22124\n\u221a\n2e\u2212\u03c0\/\f cos\n(\n(1\u2212 \u03c6)\n\b\n)\n+ 4\n\u221a\n2e\u2212\u03c0\/\f cos\n(\n(a\u2212 log a\u2212 \u03c6)\n\b\n)\n= 4\n\u221a\n2e\u2212\u03c0\/\fRe\n((\nei(a\u2212log a)\/\f \u2212 ei\/\f\n)\ne\u2212i\u03c6\/\f\n)\n,\nwhich corresponds to\ny \u223c y0 \u2212 4\n\u221a\n2\be\u2212\u03c0\/\fIm\n((\nei(a\u2212log a)\/\f \u2212 ei\/\f\n)\ne\u2212i\u03c6\/\f\n)\n.\nHence the amplitude of the wave train at infinity is\n4\n\u221a\n2\be\u2212\u03c0\/\f\n\u2223\u2223\u2223ei(a\u2212log a)\/\f \u2212 ei\/\f\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 .(5.9)\nAs a \u2192 0 the factor |ei(a\u2212log a)\/\f \u2212 ei\/\f| vanishes infinitely often, as the waves from\nthe two singularities move in and out of phase. When the two wave trains are out of\nphase, the waves that are turned on at the first Stokes line are effectively turned off\nat the second, and there is a finite section of the free boundary on which capillary\nwaves are present. This cancellation can occur because the amplitude of the waves\ngenerated by the stagnation point and the corner are exactly equal at leading order,\nsince \u2223\u2223\u2223sin(\u03c0\u03b1corner\n2\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223 =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223sin(\u03c0\u03b1stagnation\n2\n)\u2223\u2223\u2223 .\nAlthough such a situation would seem to be very special, we will see in section 6 that\nthere are many examples of potential flows where two singularities generate waves of\nexactly the same amplitude, and we have the possibility of a finite section of the free\nboundary containing capillary waves.\nThe limit a\u2192 0 is a singular one since the stagnation point disappears to infinity\nbut the capillary waves it generates are still felt, and the difference in \u03c6 at the stagna-\ntion point and the corner determines the phase difference of the two trains of waves.\nThe case a = 0 corresponds to flow around a corner, shown in Figure 2. In this case\nthere is no stagnation point and only one set of waves present, with amplitude\n4\n\u221a\n2\be\u2212\u03c0\/\f.(5.10)\nIn the next section we describe our numerical scheme and compare these asymptotic\nresults to a direct numerical simulation of the full problem.\n5.2.

The symmetry of the quadrature and of the distribution of mesh points\nenabled us to evaluate the Cauchy principal value as if it were an ordinary integral.\nWe evaluate the values of \u03b8[\u03b6(\u03c6)] at the midpoints \u03c6MI by interpolation formulas\nWe now satisfy (2.5) at the midpoints \u03c6MI , I = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1. For given values of \b\nand a, this yields N \u2212 1 nonlinear algebraic equations for the N + 1 unknowns \u03b8I\nand b. Two more equations are obtained by imposing \u03b81 = \u03b82 = \u03b83. This forces\nthe free surface to be flat far upstream. This system of N + 1 equations with N + 1\nunknowns is solved by Newton\u2019s method. For \b small, the exact solution for \b = 0 is\nchosen as an initial guess. For larger values of \b a continuation method is used; i.e., a\n1886 S. J. CHAPMAN AND J.-M. VANDEN-BROECK\nconverged solution is used as an initial guess to compute a solution for a larger value\nof \b. Most calculations were performed with N = 1500, X\u2212 = \u221281, and X+ = 54. We\nrepeated some of the calculations with larger values of N , X+, and |X\u2212| and checked\nthat all the results presented are independent of the values of these parameters within\ngraphical accuracy.\nA typical free surface profile is shown in Figure 3. As \b increases, the amplitude of\nthe waves increase and the profiles approach the limiting configuration with a trapped\nbubble at the trough predicted by the exact solutions of Crapper [7] and Kinnersley\n[13].\nIn Figure 4 we show a comparison of the asymptotic and numerical values of the\nlog of the amplitude of the waves at infinity as \b varies for a = 0.26644. In Figure\n5 we show a comparison of the asymptotic and numerical values of the amplitude of\nthe waves at infinity as a varies for \b = 0.4. We see that the asymptotic solution is\nremarkably accurate, even at relatively large values of \b.\nWe found that larger and larger values of N were needed to compute accurate\nsolutions as a was decreased below 0.15, and we are unable to extend the numerical\nresults to the predicted first cancellation between the two asymptotic wave trains.\nHowever, the numerical results do confirm the maximum in the amplitude of the\nwaves predicted by the asymptotic solution.\nFor the limiting case a = 0 corresponding to flow around a corner we derived a\nseparate numerical scheme. The flow configurations in the physical plane and in the\ncomplex potential plane are illustrated in Figure 2. We map the complex potential of\nFigure 2(b) into the lower half of the \u03b1+ i\u03b2 plane by the transformation\n\u03b1+ i\u03b2 = e\u2212(\u03c6+i\u03c8).(5.14)\nThe free surface is mapped on the negative \u03b1-axis and the corner on the positive\n\u03b1-axis.\nWe denote by \u03c4\u221e \u2212 i\u03b8\u221e the free streamline solution corresponding to \b = 0 (i.e.,\nno surface tension). Next we apply the Cauchy integral formula to the function\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4\u221e \u2212 i(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u221e)(5.15)\nwith a contour consisting of the \u03b1-axis and a semicircle of arbitrary large radius in\nthe lower \u03b1+ i\u03b2-plane. This yields\n\u03c4(\u03b1) =\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b8(\u03b1\u00af)\u2212 \u03b8\u221e(\u03b1\u00af)\n\u03b1\u00af\u2212 \u03b1 d\u03b1\u00af.(5.16)\nIn (5.16), we used the properties \u03b8\u2212\u03b8\u221e = 0 on the positive \u03b1-axis and \u03c4\u221e = 0 on the\nfree surface \u03b1 > 0. The integral in (5.16) is a Cauchy principal value. The numerical\nprocedure then follows the one described at the beginning of this section with (5.4)\nreplaced by (5.16) and \u03b6(\u03c6) by \u03b1(\u03c6) = \u2212e\u2212\u03c6.\nA typical free surface profile is shown in Figure 6. In Figure 7 we show a compar-\nison of the asymptotic and numerical values of the log of the amplitude of the waves\nat infinity as \b varies for a = 0.\n6. Other examples.

Since these all lie on the same streamline they have the same value\nof \u03c80 and hence the same exponential factor in the amplitude of the capillary waves\ngenerated. To determine where on the free surface the waves begin we simply follow\n1890 S. J. CHAPMAN AND J.-M.

Note that there\nare two such equipotentials from the stagnation point, but only one meets the free\nsurface.\nIf the plough is polygonal, these will be the only singularities in the flow field. For\ngeneral ploughs, though, when we analytically continue the solution into the plough we\nwill encounter further singularities, which will also generate capillary waves. However,\nthese will all have a value of \u03c8 greater than that on the boundary of the plough, and\nwill therefore generate waves which are exponentially subdominant to those generated\nby singularities on the plough itself.\nThe wave train proceeding to infinity will be the superposition of those generated\nat each singularity. If the plough is analytic, the only relevant singularity is the\nstagnation point, and the amplitude of waves at infinity will be\n4\n\u221a\n2\be\u2212\u03c80\/\f.\n6.2. Flow over a rough boundary. For flow over a general smooth surface\nwe need to analytically continue outside the flow domain until we meet the first\nsingularity. Generically there will be one such singularity and it will generate a train\nof capillary waves. (Occasionally we meet more than one singularity with the same\nvalue of \u03c8; for example, any streamline in Figure 1 may be taken as the boundary\nEXPONENTIAL ASYMPTOTICS AND CAPILLARY WAVES 1891\nD\u2032\nD\nB\u2032\nB\nAA\u2032\nE\nE \u2032\n(a)\nD D\u2032\nB\u2032A\u2032\nB\nE E \u2032\nA\n(b)\nFig. 9.

There\nare two Stokes lines (dashed) meeting the free boundary, originating at the corners A and B.\nof a flow, the analytic continuation of which will lead to the corner and stagnation\npoint singularities.) If the surface is not smooth, then we know that the nearest\nsingularities are those on the surface. For example, for flow over the step shown\nin Figure 9 there are two relevant singularities, corresponding to the two corners.\nSince k = 2\/3, \u03b1 = \u22121\/2 for one corner, and k = 2, \u03b1 = 1\/2 for the other, the\nwaves generated by both singularities have the same amplitude and there is again,\ntherefore, the possibility that they are exactly out of phase and cancel out. Thus\nthere is a discrete set of step heights (accumulating at infinity) for which there is a\nbounded region of capillary waves on the free surface.\n6.3. Flow past a submerged object. For flow past a smooth object (as shown\nin Figure 10, for example) there will in general be two singularities on the surface of\nthe object corresponding to the leading and trailing stagnation points. These both\nhave k = 2\/3, \u03b1 = \u22121\/2 so that there is the possibility that the wave trains again\ncancel, which they will do for a discrete set of values of \b.\nIf the object also has corners, then we have to take into account the waves gen-\nerated by these singularities, also.\nIf there is circulation about the object, then the two stagnation points may merge\nand eventually detach, as shown in Figure 11. Then there is only one singularity, but\nthere are two equipotential lines from it which meet the free surface, so that there\nwill still be two wave trains. Whether these are out of phase or not depends on the\n\u201cdepth\u201d of the stagnation point, so that in this case there is a discrete set of values\nfor the circulation for which there are bounded waves on the free surface.\n1892 S.

Figure 12 shows equal and opposite impinging jets (or\nequivalently a jet impinging normally on a plane wall). The only singularity is the\nstagnation point, and the equipotentials from it meet each of the free boundaries once,\nso that each of the incoming jets will have a train of capillary waves on each side.\nThis easily generalizes to unequal and\/or obliquely impinging jets.\n6.5.

However, if\nthe source is close to the lower boundary, then the equipotential from the stagnation\npoint meets the streamline DC on the section D\u2032C, so that capillary waves are not\ngenerated on the free boundary in this case.\n6.6.

However, equipotentials from A and\nC meet the free boundary D\u2032D at E\u2032 and E, respectively. Hence there will be two\nsets of capillary waves on this free surface, one generated at E\u2032 and one generated at\nE.\nHowever, the flow separation point A is a type of flow singularity that we have\nnot yet considered.

Conclusion. We have employed recently developed techniques in asymptotics\nbeyond all orders to examine the problem of exponentially small capillary waves on\npotential flows with small surface tension in the absence of gravity. Much of the\ntheory can be worked out analytically, and the results are pleasingly simple.\nWe find that waves will be generated whenever the equipotential from a singu-\nlarity in the flow (such as a corner or stagnation point) meets the free surface. Our\nanalysis gives the jump in the amplitude of the waves as this equipotential is crossed;\nto determine on which section of the free boundary they are present, the standard\n1896 S. J. CHAPMAN AND J.-M. VANDEN-BROECK\nradiation condition needs to be used. The jump in amplitude of the waves is found\nto be of the form\nC\bne\u2212\u03c80\/\f,(7.1)\nwhere \u03c80 is the modulus of the difference between the streamfunction on the free\nsurface and at the singularity (i.e., the flux of fluid between these streamlines, since\nthe unperturbed skin speed is normalized to unity), and \b is the surface tension\nparameter. The algebraic factor \bn depends in a simple way on the type of singularity;\ncorners and stagnation points have n = 1, while separation points have n = 3\/2.\nFinally, the constant C can also be calculated simply; for corners and stagnation\npoints C = 8 sin(\u03c0\u03b1\/2), where dw\/dz \u221d (w\u2212w0)\u03b1 locally. Typically, for a stagnation\npoint \u03b1 = 1\/2, while for flow around a corner \u03b1 = 1 \u2212 \u03b2\/\u03c0, where \u03b2 is the interior\n(i.e., in the fluid) angle of the corner.\nFor flows which have singularities in the physical domain (flows with stagnation\npoints or flows around polygonal objects) the relevant singularities are easy to de-\ntermine. Flows with no singularities in the physical domain must be analytically\ncontinued to find the nearest singularity outside the flow domain.\nAn intriguing possibility, which seems to be realized in many of the flows we\nhave examined, is that there are two Stokes lines meeting the free boundary with a\nbounded region containing capillary waves between them\u2014the waves turned on at the\nfirst Stokes line are effectively turned off at the second.\nWe have compared our asymptotic results with a direct numerical simulation for\na simple ploughing flow and for flow around a right-angled corner. In both cases the\nresults are surprisingly accurate, even at values of \b as high as 1.5.\nFinally, we have a word of warning when determining the position of singularities,\nespecially when this involves analytically continuing outside the flow region. Because\nof the exponential dependence of the waves on the value of the complex potential at\nthe singularity, an order-\b perturbation to the position of the singularity produces and\norder-one perturbation to the waves. If this perturbation is in \u03c8, the amplitude of the\nwave is perturbed by an order one amount, while if it is in \u03c6, the phase of the waves\nis perturbed by an order one amount. This is the reason we chose a as our control\nparameter in the example of section 5; if we had used b to control the height of the\nplough it would have been much harder to compare to the numerical solution, since\nwe would need to know a to order \b. However, having said this, for many problems\n(such as those we have considered) the positions of the singularities are determined\nexactly (or at least the value of \u03c8 at the singularity is), since they lie at corners or\nstagnation points on a submerged object.\nAppendix A. Inner expansion in the vicinity of the complex singularity\ngenerated by flow separation.\nAs in section 3.3, in the vicinity of the singularity in the complex plane the right-\nhand side of (2.6) in the inner region is simply the inner limit of log q \u2212 i\u03b8. Hence,\nsince q0 = 1 on the free boundary, and\n\u03b80 \u223c const. + \u03b2(w \u2212 w0)1\/2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nsay, in the vicinity of w0, we have\nlog q \u2212 i\u03b8 \u223c \u2212i\u03b2(w \u2212 w0)1\/2 + const. + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,(A.1)\n\u22122\bq d\u03b8\ndw\n= q2 \u2212 1.(A.2)\nEXPONENTIAL ASYMPTOTICS AND CAPILLARY WAVES 1897\nWe define the inner variable \u03b7 as before by w = w0 \u2212 \bi\u03b7. Then, differentiating (A.1)\ngives\nq\u2032\nq\n\u2212 i\u03b8\u2032 = \u03b2e\n\u22123i\u03c0\/4\b1\/2\n2\u03b71\/2\n,\nwhere \u2032 represents d\/d\u03b7. Substituting into (A.2) gives\nq\u2032 +\n1\n2\n(q2 \u2212 1)\u2212 \u03b2e\n\u22123i\u03c0\/4\b1\/2q\n2\u03b71\/2\n= 0.(A.3)\nNow the correct scaling for q is\nq = 1 +\n\u03b2\b1\/2e\u22123i\u03c0\/4q\u00af\n2\n,(A.4)\ngiving to leading order\nq\u00af\u2032 + q\u00af \u2212 1\n\u03b71\/2\n= 0.(A.5)\nThus the relevant inner problem for q is in fact linear, unlike in section 3.3 where it\nwas nonlinear. This is because the singularity generated by flow separation is not in\nthe leading-order term in z(w) as w \u2192 w0 but in a higher-order term.\nTo determine \u039b we again need to match the inner limit of (3.12) with the outer\nlimit of (A.5). To this end we expand q\u00af as \u03b7 \u2192\u221e giving\nq\u00af = 2e\u2212\u03b7\n\u222b \u03b71\/2\new\n2\ndw =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\n(2n)!\n22nn!\u03b7n+1\/2\n.(A.6)\nWriting the outer expansion (3.14) in terms of the inner variable \u03b7 gives\n\bnqn \u223c i\u039b\b\n1\/2\u0393(n\u2212 1\/2)\n\u03b7n\u22121\/2\nas n\u2192\u221e.(A.7)\nMatching (A.6) and (A.7) gives\n\u039b =\n\u03b2e\u22125i\u03c0\/4\n2\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n(2n)!\n22nn!\u0393(n+ 1\/2)\n=\n\u03b2e\u22125i\u03c0\/4\n2\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T.R.
