In both chloroplast and nuclear datasets, high levels of \ngenetic diversity were found within all populations and genetic differentiation among \npopulations was low, indicating extensive gene flow. Analysis of population structure \nprovided support for the presence of 2 groups of populations, although all individuals had \nmixed ancestry. Groups reflected the influence of geography on gene flow, with one \nrepresenting Rift Valley populations whilst the other represented populations from \nEastern Kenya.

Across \nthis vast area (approximately 55% of Africa\u2019s surface, Wickens et al. 1995) low and \nerratic rainfall (annually, <100-600 mm), high temperatures and poor soil water and \nnutrient availability limit agricultural productivity and place a high value on perennial, \nmultipurpose tree species that provide a means to maximise agricultural potential and \nstabilise yields in stressful, unpredictable growing conditions (Fagg & Allison 2004). In \nthe ASALs, the currently under-utilised tree species Acacia senegal (L.) Willd. \n(Fabaceae, Mimosoideae, Aculeiferum) has been recognised as having great potential to \nincrease and diversify agricultural production as well as stabilise and restore degraded, \nvulnerable agroecosystems. In Kenya, where a new market is developing for an exudate \nfrom the species, commonly known as gum arabic, there is currently keen interest in \nassessing, protecting and improving local A. senegal resources, for the benefit of the large \nsilvopastoral dryland community. \n \nAcacia senegal is a small, deciduous tree, most highly valued for the production of gum \narabic, a commodity of international trade since ancient times. Gum arabic is used in \nfood, pharmaceuticals, cosmetic products and lithographic ink, because of its unique \nemulsification, film forming and encapsulation properties, making it a very important \neconomic resource in the ASALs (Goodrum et al. 2000; Motlagh et al. 2006; Al-Assaf et \nal. 2007). In addition, the tree improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation and \nprovides shade, fodder, traditional medicine, fuel wood and substrate stabilisation (Arce \n4 \n & Blanks 2001; Raddad et al. 2005). It is distributed in arid and semi-arid zones, mostly \nin tropical and sub-tropical regions, across the whole of sub-Saharan Africa and as far as \nIndia and Pakistan (White 1983; FAO 1985; ICRAF 1992). Four varieties are recognised \nwithin the species: senegal, kerensis, rostrata and leiorhachis (Brenan 1983; Fagg & \nAllison 2004), of which three (senegal, leiorhachis and kerensis) are found in Kenya. The \nlatter, variety kerensis, is most widely distributed in Kenya and is very highly valued for \nthe quality of gum it produces, forming the basis of an active international market (Booth \n& Wickens 1988; Fagg & Allison 2004; Chretin et al. 2008). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \nAs part of an effort to promote sustainable management and conservation of forests for \nthe production of wood and non-wood products, and increased tree-planting in ASALs, \nthe Kenyan government has called for research on priority species (Sessional Paper no 9, \n2005, Forest Policy), of which Acacia senegal is one. A science-based strategy for \nmanagement and exploitation of genetic resources would help to identify the factors \nunderlying gum quality variation and improve sustainability of production for the benefit \nof dryland inhabitants (Chikamai & Banks 1993; Chikamai & Odera 2002; Motlagh et al. \n2006). An important focus for research and development, one which limits adoption and \ndomestication of A. senegal, is variation in chemical composition of the gum. This \ndetermines gum quality and ultimately, its end use (Chikamai & Odera 2002; Motlagh et \nal. 2006). It is known that the chemical and molecular structure of gum is highly variable \ndepending on source and this has significant effects on trade (Chikamai & Banks 1993; \nJurasek et al. 1994; Islam et al. 1997; Chikamai & Odera 2002; Motlagh et al. 2006). If \nthis geographic variation is a genetically controlled trait then there is the potential for \n5 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nproductivity improvement by sourcing and distribution of superior germplasm. However, \nin this case it is important, for maintenance of extant genetic resources and avoidance of \ngenetic pollution, that the distribution and sources of genetic variation are well-\ncharacterised and the physical dimensions of gene flow understood.  \n \nDespite its biological, social and economic importance, little information exists on the \ngenetic resources of A. senegal variety kerensis in Kenya (Chikamai & Banks 1993; \nChikamai & Odera 2002). Indeed, only limited information is available on the extent, \ndistribution and nature of its genetic variability across its entire distribution range (Fagg \n& Allison 2004). Genetic diversity and population structure of variety senegal was \nevaluated using isoenzymes in Senegal and low diversity was reported (H=0.175, \nBergonzini & Joly 1992; Chevallier et al. 1994). Another study of population \ndifferentiation in variety senegal with samples from Kenya, Sudan, Pakistan, Mali and \nMauritania found a clear separation between West and East African populations \n(Chevallier & Borgel 1998), a distinction most probably due only to distance. The only \nstudy on Kenyan populations of A. senegal was done using random amplified \npolymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter-specific simple sequence repeat (ISSR), which \nreported moderate diversity (H = 0.283, Chiveu et al. 2008). However this study made no \ndistinction between varieties; as commercial gum production in Kenya is entirely from \nvariety kerensis, this is a division that must be recognised. Knowledge of genetic \ndiversity and population structure of variety kerensis in its natural range in Kenya is \ncrucial for formulation of appropriate management strategies directed towards \nconservation and maximum utilization of the genetic resource (Hueneke 1991; Malligan \n6 \n et al. 1994). Furthermore, information on population differentiation will help to develop \nefficient sampling strategies for the variety (Bonnin et al. 1996) and enable conservation \nand improvement initiatives. \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n \nTo identify levels and structure of genetic variation and initiate development of long term \nstrategies for sustainable use of resources, a widespread analysis of variation in the \nspecies in Kenya was undertaken. To achieve this, a combination of nuclear and \nchloroplast microsatellites was used. This approach takes advantage of data from \ndifferent parts of the genome to provide insight into different aspects of the species\u2019 \nevolution, at different timescales and reflecting different modes of gene dispersal (nuclear \nDNA is dispersed via pollen and seed, whilst organelle DNA is dispersed by seed only). \nThe aim was to characterize and understand the genetic diversity and structure of natural \npopulations of A. senegal variety kerensis in Kenya, detect population structure and \npatterns of gene flow and identify factors influencing diversity across the range and in \nindividual populations.  \n \n7 \n Results 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \nGenetic diversity \nA total of 48 alleles were observed across the 7 nuclear microsatellite loci used in this \nstudy with a total number of alleles detected per locus varying from 4 (Ame02 and Ab06) \nto 13 (Ab26) and an average number of alleles of 6.9 per locus (Table 1). Gene diversity \n(HE) values per locus ranged from 0.530 (Ame05) to 0.868 (Ab26) with a mean value over \nall loci at 0.697, while observed heterozygosity (HO) values ranged from 0.516 (Ame05) \nto 0.800 (Ame03) with a mean value of 0.709 (Table 1). At individual loci, four \ndepartures from HWE were noted: loci Ame07 and Ab26 showed significant (P < 0.05) \nheterozygote excess, whilst Ame02 and Ab18 showed significant (P < 0.001) \nheterozygote deficits. No linkage disequilibrium was detected between different \ngenotypes with the Fisher exact test among the different microsatellite loci (P > 0.05) \nindicating that all seven loci segregate independently of each other.  \n \nAmong the 11 populations surveyed, the mean multilocus observed heterozygosity (HO) \nbased on nuclear data was highest at Ngarendare (0.824, Table 2) and lowest at Daaba \n(0.613), whilst allelic richness (AR) per population ranged from 5.05 at Serolipi to 4.27 at \nDaaba based on a minimum sample size of 20 individuals per population. Private alleles \nwere identified in three of the 11 populations. One private allele per population was \nfound in Ngarendare, Ngurunit and Serolipi. \n \n8 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nA total of 8 alleles were found across the two chloroplast loci, characterising 9 \nhaplotypes. Mean within population diversity (HS) was 0.679, whilst overall diversity \n(HT) was 0.807.  \n \nAt a population level, significant deviations from HWE were observed at three sites \n(Table 2): heterozygote deficiency - Daaba (FIS = 0.039, P < 0.01), heterozygote excess - \nNgarendare (-0.207, P < 0.001), Merille (-0.136, P < 0.05). However, across all loci and \nall populations there was no significant deviation from HWE.  \n \nPopulation differentiation and structure  \nPopulation differentiation and structure was evaluated using both FST and RST. No \nsignificant differentiation was detected using FST across all populations and loci (0.045, P \n> 0.05), whilst RST was significant 0.125 (P < 0.05). If the stepwise mutation model is \nassumed, as seems reasonable for microsatellite evolution, there is a low but significant \ndifferentiation among populations, although in general high levels of gene flow are \nprevalent. Theory suggests that population differentiation is more accurately estimated by \nSMM, because this best accounts for the high mutation rate of microsatellite markers. In \ncontrast, IAM often underestimates population differentiation at microsatellite loci \n(Hedrick, 1995).  \n \nBased on variation in chloroplast haplotype, population differentiation (GST) across all \npopulations was 0.159. Comparing RST and GST (Pons & Petit, 1996) for the chloroplast \ndata, no evidence for phylogeographic structure was found, reflecting the fact that \n9 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \npopulations are largely mixed for chloroplast haplotypes. In keeping with these results, \nanalysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) found that most of the genetic variation was \npartitioned within (91 %) rather than among (9 %) the populations (Table 3), as is \ncharacteristic of an outcrossing tree species (Hamrick et al, 1992). \n \nThe genetic distance between populations based on Cavalli-Sforza and Edward\u2019s chord \ndistance (Dc) ranged from 0.152 (Archers\u2019 Post and Merille) to 0.347 (Ngarendare and \nLokichar) with an average distance of 0.264 (Table 4). Mantel tests showed a positive but \nnon-significant correlation of both FST (r = 0.099, P > 0.05) and RST (r = 0.2314, P > \n0.05) with geographic distance for the 55 pairwise comparisons among the 11 populations \nunder the isolation-by-distance model.  \n \nUsing the delta K criterion (Evanno et al 2005), Bayesian clustering (Pritchard et al 2000; \nFalush et al 2003, 2007) suggested the presence of two groups as most probable (Figure \n2), although all individuals showed mixed ancestry. This separation placed populations \nKakuma, Lokichar, Lokitaung and Marigat within one group (defining group membership \nas most individuals within a population having >60% ancestry of that group), whilst \nArcher\u2019s Post, Kargi, Merille and Ngarendare fell within a second group. Populations \nDaaba, Ngurunit and Serolipi were highly mixed and not clearly within one group or \nanother. Spatial analysis of chloroplast variance also suggested most likely presence of \ntwo groups, although not completely coincident with the groups identified in the nuclear \nmicrosatellite data. Groups were: 1. Kakuma, Lokichar, Lokitaung and Ngurunit and 2. \nMarigat, Merille, Ngarendare and Serolipi (Figure 1).  \n10 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n \nTests for bottlenecks \nUsing the Wilcoxon\u2019s signed rank test, all 11 populations deviated significantly from \nmutation-drift equilibrium (P < 0.05) under the assumption of the infinite allelic mutation \nmodel (IAM), whilst only two of the populations (Kargi, Ngurunit) showed significant \ndeviations under the TPM and SMM (Table 2, results shown for TPM only). In two \npopulations (Kargi, Kakuma) evidence of a mode-shift was detected.  \n11 \n Discussion 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \nGenetic diversity \nFrom nuclear microsatellite data, all populations showed high levels of genetic diversity. \nThe levels of heterozygosity (mean HE = 0.667) detected were comparable to estimates \nobtained for other tropical tree species such as Ceiba pentandra (HE = 0.85, Brondani et \nal., 2003), Carapa guianensis (HE = 0.61, Dayanandan et al., 1999), Swietenia humilis \n(HE = 0.53, White et al., 1999) and Swietenia macrophylla (HE = 0.66, Novick et al., \n2003) and are in keeping with expectations for widespread, long lived and outcrossing \ntree species (Hamrick & Godt 1990; Hamrick et al. 1992; Figueira et al. 2006). The \nestimates were similar to those recorded for the species from which the microsatellites \nwere transferred, A. brevispica (HE = 0.72, Otero-Arnaiz et al., 2005) and A. mellifera \n(HE = 0.67, Ruiz-Guajardo et al., 2007). Diversity estimates from the chloroplast data \nwere also high (HT = 0.807), although similar to those found in other species (e.g. \nVitellaria paradoxa, Hecp = 0.71, Fontaine et al. 2004; Adansonia digitata, GST = 0.97, \nTsy et al, 2009).  \n \nSuch findings confirm earlier studies of the species by Chevallier et al. (1994) using \nisoenzymes, where significant levels of heterozygosity and partitioning of the majority of \nvariation within populations was attributed to its outcrossing mating system. Doligez & \nJoly (1997), reviewing the outcrossing rates reported for 28 species of tropical forest trees \nin natural populations, found high genetic diversity to be common. Such levels of \ndiversity are maintained by high levels of gene flow facilitated by efficient pollen \n12 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nmovement by pollinators and the widespread occurrence of efficient self-incompatibility \nmechanisms (Dick et al, 2008; White et al., 2002).  \n \nIn general, most populations showed no significant deviation from HWE, although slight \nheterozygote excess was observed in some. Significant deviations from HWE were \nobserved in three populations: Ngarendare and Merille showed heterozygote excess, \nwhilst Daaba showed significant heterozygote deficiency. Acacia senegal var. kerensis is \nfound distributed across the whole of the northern part of Kenya and is known to be long-\nlived (Fagg and Allison, 2004). The high levels of allelic diversity and heterozygosity \ncoupled with low and negative values of FIS found in this study support botanical and \nexperimental data suggesting that A. senegal is a predominantly outcrossing species. In \npollination trials, Obunga (1995) and Tandon et al. (2001) found A. senegal to be almost \nexclusively outcrossed and self incompatible. The numerous flowers produce abundant \npollen, grouped into polyads of 16 pollen grains (Guinet, 1969) and the cup-shaped non-\npapillate stigma generally only accommodates one polyad. While self-pollen can be \ndeposited on the stigma, self-incompatibility appears to operate inside the embryo sac and \nmay function either pre- or post-fertilization (Obunga, 1995). The significant deviations \nnoted at Ngarendare, Merille and Daaba therefore probably reflect local site history, \nalthough, due to a lack of detailed historical information, explanations can only be \nspeculative. There are various potential causes of heterozygote excess: e.g. heterozygote \nadvantage, negative assortative mating, clonal growth, reduced presence of selfed \nprogeny due to small population size, population mixing (Stoeckel et al, 2006). In the \nabsence of good supporting data to allow rejection of the first three and as there is no \n13 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nevidence for clonal reproduction in this species, the most parsimonious explanation \nseems to be demographic. Certainly, the sample taken from the site at Ngarendare and \nMerille were necessarily (due to low density) drawn from across a much greater area than \nat other sites and so may represent mixing of discrete demographic units. In contrast, \nheterozygote deficiency is most commonly the result of inbreeding, due either to selfing \nor mating between close relatives (biparental inbreeding). The population at Daaba was \nnotably even-sized (80 % of trees of the same height and DBH) suggesting they may be a \nsingle or few cohorts, possibly establishing together as a result of some disturbance event. \nThe area is known to be prone to flooding which would provide a mechanism for \nsignificant, biased seed dispersal. If the population is more closely related than it would \nbe if seed dispersal was random, a slight reduction in heterozygosity might be expected. \n \nPopulation differentiation and structure \nAt nuclear markers, the degree of differentiation among populations was low (FST = \n0.0447), even taking the evolution of microsatellites into account (RST = 0.12483) \nalthough the latter estimate should most accurately reflect the true situation (Hedrick \n1995). Similarly, for chloroplast data, differentiation was low (reflecting the effectiveness \nof gene flow via seed dispersal), though slightly higher than at nuclear markers (GST = \n0.159). In contrast to patterns observed for many tree species, the levels of differentiation \nat nuclear and chloroplast markers were of a similar order of magnitude: it is expected \nthat differentiation at chloroplast markers will be higher, due to the more limited \ndispersal capability of seeds versus pollen, the slower evolution of the chloroplast \nmolecule and lower effective population size. However, in A. senegal, it appears that \n14 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \ndispersal via pollen and seed may be equally effective and highly efficient. The species is \nboth wind  (Tybirk, 1997) and insect pollinated (Fagg & Allison, 2004) and, as the \nlandscapes in which it commonly occurs tend to be structurally open, the potential for \nlong distance pollen dispersal is high. Open, low density forest structures facilitate longer \npollen dispersal distances, not just because pollinators must travel further to find \nflowering conspecifics but also because visibility of flowering trees is heightened, \ndrawing pollinators across longer distances. Indeed, it has been observed that \nfragmentation of forested populations often drives increases in pollen dispersal distances \n(Dick et al 2008; White et al 1999, 2002). If wind dispersal also plays a role in \npollination, dispersal distances should also be increased. The seeds of A. senegal are \nrelatively large and attractive as a food source to animals in arid environments (Fagg & \nAllison, 2004). Dispersal following ingestion has a high potential to be long distance \n(Hamrick et al., 1991), particularly as the animals in question may be domestic herds \nbelonging to pastoralist communities in transit between sparsely distributed pastures or \nwater sources and potentially between regions during seasonal movements of livestock.  \n \nGenerally speaking, however, these data suggest the existence of a single, weakly \nstructured population, with few physical barriers to gene flow and extensive outcrossing \n(9 % of variation among populations - AMOVA and no significant isolation  by distance). \nVery low levels of differentiation were observed in the earlier isoenzyme and \nRAPD\/ISSR studies (Chevallier et al. 1994; Chiveu et al. 2008), with over 80 % of \nvariation partitioned within population. This is in keeping with general observations for \nother tropical tree species with similarly high outcrossing rates and wide distributions, \n15 \n (Muona 1990; Hamrick & Godt 1990; Hamrick et al. 1991, Dayanandan, et al. 1999; \nWhite et al. 1999; Collevatti et al. 2001; Lemes et al. 2002) and suggests species \necology, such as pollen and seed dispersal mechanisms and demographic history, rather \nthan biogeography, is the major driver of population structure in Kenyan A. senegal \n(Alvarez-Buylla et al. 1996).  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n \nIn studies of other Acacia species, geographic patterns have been similar. Joly et al. \n(1992), in a study of the population genetics of Faidherbia albida (Delile) A. Chev.- a \nspecies with similar seed and pollen dispersal characteristics to A. senegal - found strong \ndifferentiation among geographic zones, although the comparison was between West \nAfrican and Zimbabwean populations. Within West Africa, where population \ndifferentiation might be expected to more directly reflect seed and pollen dispersal \ncharacteristics, genetic differentiation among populations bore no relation to geography, \nand the influence of grazing animals was proposed. In a survey of allozyme variation in \nAcacia melanoxylon two genetically distinct regions were observed (Playford et al. \n1993), and similar differentiation was found by Brain (1986) in a study of the influence \nof environment on the geographic distribution of Acacia karroo. These studies indicated \nthe role of geographic distance in the partitioning of genetic variation. \n \nNevertheless, some structuring of the Kenyan populations was noted, with two groupings \ndetected in both nuclear and chloroplast data. Although groups in the two datasets do not \nprecisely coincide, there appears to have been division in the past between populations to \nthe northwest of Lake Turkana and those in Eastern Kenya. Effective gene flow \n16 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nfollowing this division appears to have more or less eliminated differentiation between \nthese groups but traces still remain. Clustering of populations using nuclear data suggests \nthe Eastern Rift Valley formation may have played a role in shaping gene flow with \nMarigat, Lokichar, Kakuma and Lokitaung - all located within or to the west of the \nEastern Rift - showing predominant common ancestry, whilst to the east populations were \neither predominantly of single ancestry or highly mixed; the chloroplast data was largely \nin agreement. The intermediate case, Marigat, which grouped with eastern populations \nfor chloroplast data but with Rift Valley populations for nuclear data, reflects the \neffective gene dispersal capability of the species and indicates how effectively \npopulations are now mixed. As to the potential driving forces for creating the two \ngroupings observed, a more rigorous analysis of the habitat requirements of A. senegal \nvar. kerensis might shed some light. Certainly the zone between northwest Turkana and \nEastern Kenya represents something of a corridor between the extensive drylands of \nSudan and those of the Horn of Africa, and is interrupted not just by the Lake itself, but \nalso by numerous upland areas such as the Samburu, Lenkiyo, Ndoto and Nyiru hills, all \nof which rise above common altitudinal limits for A. senegal var. kerensis. In this region, \nfollowing an increase in aridity which began >2Mya (Bonnefille, 1976) the environment \nhas remained relatively stable despite global climatic shifts (Gibernau & Montuire 1996). \nIt is possible that more extensive forest vegetation and changes in the Lake levels could \nhave been sufficient to restrict A. senegal to disjunct eastern and western populations, that \nhave subsequently expanded, but this will require more detailed analysis, in particular \nbringing in other varieties of the species which co-occur with var. kerensis in Kenya.  \n \n17 \n Population bottlenecks 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nBottleneck effects were detected in all the populations of Acacia senegal under the \ninfinite alleles model (IAM) but in only two populations under the stepwise mutation \n(SMM) and the two-phase mutation (TMM) models . Under the IAM, microsatellite loci \nmay exhibit heterozygosity excess even in stable populations (Cornuet & Luikart, 1996; \nLuikart & Cornuet 1998; Maruyama & Fuerst, 1985), so it seems conservative to assume \nthat the finding of bottlenecks in all populations under this model is excessive and that \nthe results of assuming a TPM or SMM (which were broadly in agreement) are closer to \nreality. In the latter cases, two of the populations show significant effects deviations from \nequilibrium heterozygosity suggesting recent bottlenecks; this is not to say that other \npopulations have not undergone bottlenecks, but indicates that there are two cases in \nwhich the effect is detectable. If gene flow to bottlenecked populations is extensive, as \nseems likely from other results, any signature of recent bottlenecking will be obscured.  \n \nIn any case, regardless of the mutation model assumed, two populations show significant \nsignatures of recent bottlenecks. The possible reasons for this are many. In the dry, \nnorthern part of Kenya, the destruction of forests through clearance for agriculture, \ncharcoal burning and settlement has produced landscapes of patchily distributed forests. \nSuch landscape level change may have severe effects on diversity including changes in \ncompetitive regimes of plant species, dispersal patterns of pollen and seeds and effective \npopulation size (Nason et al. 1997). Furthermore, the arid and semi-arid lands are \nsusceptible to regular natural disturbances such as fire and therefore individual \npopulations may well have experienced substantial recent size changes. Based on the \n18 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nobserved efficiency of gene flow evident in other results, it seems likely that the two \npopulations showing evidence of bottlenecking have experienced the effect recently and \nrepresent post-disturbance generations. Given the clear evidence that bottlenecking is \noccurring in some of these populations, a systematic study of multiple generations within \nsingle populations is merited to assess the impacts of recent human degradation of these \nforests. \n \nConclusions  \nThis study has detected high genetic diversity, low inter-population genetic \ndifferentiation and occurrence of gene flow at long distances in Acacia senegal var. \nkerensis in Kenya, valuable information for conservation and improvement purposes. \nUnderstanding how genetic variation is partitioned within and among populations is a \nprerequisite for decision-making in the management of natural populations of valuable \ntree species (William & Hamrick 1996), particularly where development of the species as \na commercial crop may initiate movements of germplasm. For the establishment of \nbreeding programs or seed orchards, sampling can focus on a few populations of A. \nsenegal variety kerensis as most variation should be accessible this way (Newton et al. \n2003). However, it will also be important to assess the variation in quantitative traits \nacross the range as the current data can only advise as to patterns of gene flow and likely \ndistributions of gene diversity. Selectively influenced traits may differ substantially in \ntheir distribution. The current study indicates that, historically, reproductive isolation \namong populations has been low, although the extent to which more recent population \nfragmentation has increased isolation is not clear; this will require further investigation of \n19 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \nseed and seedling generations. Although variation in neutral markers does not necessarily \nreflect the adaptive potential of different populations, the allelic richness and the variance \nin allelic frequencies are useful for estimating the contribution of each population to the \ntotal genetic diversity of a species and to orientate conservation priorities (Petit et al. \n1998). Future work will consider the sources of variation observed in the current data in \nmore detail, assess patterns of quantitative variation and, in particular, examine \nrelationships between genetic variation and gum arabic biochemical composition to \ncomplement the efforts towards improving gum arabic quality production from Kenya.  \n20 \n Methods 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nPopulation sampling  \nThree hundred individual trees of Acacia senegal variety kerensis were sampled from \neleven natural populations in Kenya representing gum arabic production potential areas \n(Table 2, Figure 1). Leaf tissue was collected from 20-30 adult trees per population at a \ndistance of between 150-600 metres apart depending on the size of the population and \ndistribution of trees within the population. Sample sizes also varied among populations \ndue to ease of accessibility. The leaves were dried on silica gel and stored at \u201320 \u00b0C until \nDNA extraction.  \n \nDNA extraction and PCR \nTotal genomic DNA was isolated from the leaves following a modified cetyltrimethyl \nammonium bromide (CTAB) procedure (Fernandez et al. 2000) and DNA quantification \nperformed through both Bio-photometer readings and comparison with low DNA mass \nladder (Invitrogen) in ethidium bromide-stained 2 % agarose gels. Polymerase chain \nreaction (PCR) amplifications of seven polymorphic microsatellite loci (Otero-Arnaiz et \nal. 2005; Ruiz-Guajardo et al. 2007) were carried out in reaction volumes of 10 \u00b5l \ncontaining approximately 20 ng of genomic DNA, 1x PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL pH \n8.3, 50 mM KCl,), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 \u03bcM of each dNTP, 0.05 \u03bcM of each primer, and 1 \nunit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplification profile used a touchdown \nprogram, with annealing temperatures ranging from 60-50, 58-48 to 55-45 (Table1), \nusing a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-225 (MJ research). The program was 95 \u00b0C for 3 \nmin, 20 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s (denaturation), either 60-50, 58-48 or 55-45 \u00b0C  \n21 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n(decreased by 0.5 \u00b0C, annealing)  for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 30 s (extension), 10 cycles of 95 \u00b0C \nfor 30 s, 50, 48 or 45 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR \nproducts were then separated on 0.25 mm thick polyacrylamide gels containing 10 % \nammonium persulfate (APS), tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)-Omnipur and 8 % \nacrylamide (Gene-PAGE plus)-Amresco, electrophoresed in 1x TBE buffer on a Li-Cor \nIR2 4200 DNA sequencer. Band sizes and genotypes were determined by referencing the \nstandard IRD 800 (50-350 bp and 50-700 bp) molecular marker from Li-Cor (Lincoln) \nusing SAGAGT version 2.1 software (Li-Cor) and double checked by eye (Khasa et al. \n2005). \nFor 8 of the 11 populations for which microsatellite genotyping was undertaken \n(Kakuma, Lokichar, Lakitaung, Marigat, Merille, Ngarendare, Ngurunit, Serolipi), two \nuniversal chloroplast microsatellite loci ccmp5 and 10 (Weising & Gardner 1999) were \namplified (selected following screening of all ccmp loci for variation; data prepared by D. \nOdee as part of a rangewide study). PCR amplification followed Weising & Gardner \n(1999) and electrophoresis was carried out on 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in \na Hoefer SE600 electrophoresis unit (300V) using Tris borate EDTA buffer (1X). All \nindividuals were characterised for cpDNA haplotype at both loci, scoring band sizes \nagainst a 1 kb standard (Microzone). \n \nData analysis \nGenetic diversity at nuclear microsatellite loci was estimated per population and overall. \nFor each locus, the total number of alleles per locus and per population was determined \nand the distribution of allele frequencies calculated. The average number of alleles per \n22 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \nlocus (A) for each population over all loci and unbiased value of expected (HE) and \nobserved (HO) frequency of heterozygote were determined using FSTAT software version \n2.9.3 (Goudet 2002). For each population, deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium \n(HWE) and linkage disequilibrium tests were performed using Fisher exact tests \nemploying GenePop 4.0 (Raymond & Rousset 1998), in which significant levels were \ndetermined using the Markov chain method (Guo & Thompson 1992). The heterozygote \ndeficiency for each locus and population was tested using GenePop 4.0 software.  \n \nThe extent and significance of genetic differentiation among populations was quantified \nusing unbiased estimates of Wright\u2019s FST (Weir & Cockerham 1984) and its analogue RST \n(Slatkin 1995) using two models for microsatellite evolution (Infinite allele model \n(Kimura & Crow 1964) and stepwise mutation model (Ohta & Kimura 1973; Kimura & \nOhta 1978)). A randomization test of pairwise FST differentiation with 1000 interactions \n(Goudet 2002) was conducted through FSTAT. Unbiased estimates of RST and their \nsignificance were determined after 1000 bootstraps with 95 % nominal confidence \ninterval and permutation tests (Lynch & Crease 1990), using RSTCALC version 2.2 \n(Goodman 1997). Fixation indices (Wright 1965); degree of inbreeding within population \n(FIS) and overall inbreeding coefficient (FIT) were also determined. The statistical \nsignificance of FIS, FIT and FST were tested by bootstrapping over loci with 95 % \nconfidence interval and significance tests of multilocus pairwise differentiation were \ndone using FSTAT software version 2.9.1 (Goudet 2002) with Bonferroni corrections. \n \n23 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nA pairwise geographic distance matrix was calculated based on the latitude and longitude \nof each population, using the Geographic Distance Matrix Generator version 1.2.2 (Ersts, \nInternet). The hypothesis, that populations are differentiated because of isolation by \ndistance, was tested by correlating pairwise FST and RST matrices against the geographical \ndistance matrix. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient was calculated and significance \ndetermined with 10000 permutations using a Mantel procedure (Mantel 1967) available \nin FSTAT software version 2.9.1 (Goudet 2002). The co-existence of two mutational \nprocesses operating on different loci or even different alleles within a microsatellite locus \nraises the question of the appropriate measure of genetic distance between populations \n(Estoup et al. 2002). It has been suggested that Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards\u2019chord \ndistance (Dc) (Cavalli-Sforza & Edwards 1967; Goldstein & Pollock 1997) should be \nmore appropriate, because it relies on the geometric disposition of populations in a \nmultidimensional sphere delimited by allele frequencies, rather than on a given \nmutational model. This distance has also been shown to be the most suitable for analysis \nof microsatellite data, even in the presence of strong bottlenecks (Takezaki & Nei 1996). \nGenetic distances between populations were calculated using Cavalli-Sforza and \nEdwards\u2019 chord distance (Dc) (Cavalli-Sforza & Edwards 1967; Goldstein & Pollock \n1997) using the GENDIST program (PHYLIP, version 3.6, Felsentein 1993). To analyze \nintra- and inter-population genetic variation, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) \nwas carried out using GenAlex version 6 software (Peakall & Smouse 2006). Population \nstructuring was analysed using Bayesian inference (implemented in STRUCTURE v2.2, \nPritchard et al 2000; Falush et al 2003, 2007). After preliminary testing, the optimal \nnumber of groups (K) was determined using a 50,000 cycle burn-in period and 500,000 \n24 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \nMonte-Carlo Markov Chains, using the admixture model (which assumes individuals \nmay have mixed ancestry), assuming correlated allele frequencies among subpopulations \nand without any prior information on clustering of samples. Simulations for each value of \nK were repeated 20 times to provide stable probability estimates. The optimal number of \ngroups was determined using the second order rate of change approach of Evanno et al \n(2005). \n \nIn general, A. senegal populations have suffered significant degradation over \napproximately the past 50 years, due to human impacts. As aging A. senegal trees is \ndifficult, and precise population histories were not available, it was not clear whether or \nnot the trees sampled in this study represented pre- or post-distrubance generations. In \naddition, natural disturbance effects, such as fire, are a frequent occurrence in arid and \nsemi-arid zones and may have played a role at any of sites studied. Therefore, the \npopulations were assessed for possible bottlenecks, following the procedure of Cornuet \nand Luikart (1996), implemented in the program BOTTLENECK v1.2 (Piry et al. 1999). \nThe infinite alleles model (IAM), stepwise mutation model (SMM) and two-phase \nmutation model (TPM, using 95% SMM) were applied. This approach compares \nobserved and expected gene diversities based on the observed number of alleles under \nmutation-drift equilibrium. Tests for mode-shift (change in allele frequency distribution) \nwere also applied. If a recent bottleneck has occurred, allelic diversity is likely to have \nbeen lost faster than heterozygosity and may be manifested as a shift in the allele \nfrequency distribution away from rare \/ low-frequency alleles. \n \n25 \n 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \nFor chloroplast data, within-population (HS) and total (HT) diversity and the level of  \npopulation subdivision (GST) were estimated using Permut v2.0 (Pons & Petit, 1996). A \ntest for phylogeographic structure was carried out by comparing the estimate of \npopulation differentiation using ordered alleles, assuming stepwise evolution, (RST) with \nthat for unordered alleles (GST). If phylogeographic structure exists, population \ndifferentiation based on ordered alleles (i.e. reflecting phylogenetic relationships) should \nexceed that based on unordered alleles. Spatial structuring of variation at chloroplast loci \nwas examined using a simulated annealing procedure - spatial analysis of molecular \nvariance (SAMOVA, Dupanloup et al, 2002). For user-defined numbers of groups (K), \nthe SAMOVA algorithm identifies geographical groups of populations such that the \ncomponent of variation partitioned among groups (FCT) is maximised. Values of K from \n2-8 were tested, with 10,000 iterations, starting from 100 initial conditions.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade \nCanada (DFAIT) through Canadian Bureau for International Education (CBIE) in the \nframework of a Graduate Student Exchange Program (GSEP) for SFO, a Marie Curie \nFellowship (ASGEN, No. 39216) at CEH for DWO and the ACACIAGUM project (EC \nFP6 contract 032233, http:\/\/inco-acaciagum.cirad.fr\/ ).
