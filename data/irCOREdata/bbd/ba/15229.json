INTRODUCTION\nThere has long been an interest in surface states and ex-\ncitations at interfaces and thin films, as exemplified by the\nearly work of Tamm1 and also of Ritchie2 who studied purely\nelectronic effects. Later, a theoretical analysis of optical sur-\nface states by Yeh et al.3 was followed by an experimental\ndemonstration of these by the same group at an air\/multilayer\nGaAs-AlGaAs \u0001Ref. 4\u0002 interface. More recently, Kavokin et\nal.5 demonstrated the theoretical existence of lossless optical\nsurface states between a pair of two different periodic dielec-\ntric multilayer structures and further suggested how such\nstates could be utilized in the construction of a polariton\nlaser.6 In analogy with and to distinguish them from the\npurely electronic excitations, such states can be called optical\nTamm states. Although no longer lossless because of the fi-\nnite conductivity of the metal, surface-plasmon polaritons\nare a related form of surface state formed at a metal\/\ndielectric interface. The interaction\/coupling of the electronic\nexcitations in the metal with light in the form of surface-\nplasmon polaritons constitutes a means of investigating such\nexcitations as well as promising the potential for device ap-\nplications such as polariton lasers. A recent review of\nsurface-plasmon polaritons and some of the associated appli-\ncations can be found in the work of Pitarke et al.7\nA key result relating to the interaction of surface plas-\nmons with light at a conventional vacuum or metal interface\nis that they can only be observed with the use of attenuated\ntotal reflection \u0001ATR\u0002 prism coupling or with an appropri-\nately structured surface in order to ensure the necessary wave\nvector conservation condition parallel to the interface. In ad-\ndition, it is found that in the standard frequency-wave vector\ndispersion plot the maximum frequency of the surface plas-\nmon asymptotically tends to \u0002p \/\u00032, where \u0002p is the bulk\nplasma frequency of the metal \u0001see, e.g., Pitarke et al.7\u0002.\nRecently Kaliteevski and co-workers8,9 proposed that Tamm\nplasmon polaritons should be observable at the interface be-\ntween a metal and a dielectric Bragg mirror without the use\nof ATR or the alternative surface structuring approach. This\nhas now been confirmed by subsequent experimental work.10\nAs in the case of a conventional surface-plasmon polariton at\na bulk dielectric-metal interface, the confinement in the\nmetal is a result of its negative dielectric constant at frequen-\ncies below its bulk plasma frequency, but the confinement in\nthe dielectric multilayer structure is due not to total internal\nreflection, but rather the photonic band gap \u0001PBG\u0002 of the\nBragg mirror. The original proposal considered a Bragg mir-\nror consisting of a GaAs\/AlAs stack, having a PBG centered\non 1 eV, with a gold metallic surface layer with a bulk\nplasma frequency corresponding to an energy \u0003\u0002p=8.9 eV.\nThe structure provided the necessary decay of the surface\nstate into both the metal and the dielectric structure at the\nenergies of interest near 1 eV. Although gold and silver, with\nplasma frequencies above the visible or infrared part of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, are the metals typically employed\nin surface-plasmon studies, recent experimental work has re-\nvealed the existence of a surface-plasmon resonance at an\ninterface involving a thin film of a conducting metal oxide11\nassumed to have \u0003\u0002p\u00041 eV. In the current work we con-\nsider a similar structure to that studied by Kaliteevski et al.,8\nbut take the metal to have the smaller bulk plasma frequency\ngiven by \u0003\u0002p=1 eV, which can occur in materials such as\nindium tin oxide. In particular, we show that it is possible to\nexcite an interface plasmon polariton with a frequency above\nthe bulk plasma frequency of the metal, in marked contrast to\nthe standard results. At frequencies just above the bulk\nplasma frequency the relative permittivity of the metal is\npositive and smaller than unity and plasmon polaritons can\nbe confined at the interface by the PBG of the Bragg stack on\none side and by total internal reflection at the metal on the\nother. The theoretical results presented predict the existence\nof states above the bulk plasma frequency and could poten-\ntially impact on a broad range of surface-plasmon\u2013polariton-\nrelated phenomena in essentially any of the applications\nwhere surface plasmons are currently employed.\nII.

The\nrelative permittivity of the metal is taken to be of the Drude\nform\n\u0006\u0001\u0002\u0002 = 1 \u2212\n\u0002p\n2\n\u0002\u0001\u0002 + i\u0002c\u0002\n,\nwhere \u0002c is the electronic collision frequency. This is the\nconventional starting point for all standard treatments \u0001see,\ne.g., Pitarke et al.7\u0002 involving surface plasmons and their\nresultant dispersion relationship. For the initial calculations,\nwe take \u0002c=0, so \u0006\u0001\u0002\u0002 is real, but we subsequently relax this\ncondition to assess the effect of losses.\nConsider first the case of TM-polarized light with wave\nvector k\u0001 in the y-z plane and the H field parallel to the inter-\nface in the x direction \u0001into the plane of Fig. 1\u0002. Within the\nmetal we take\nH\u0001 M\u0001r\u0001,t\u0002 = \u0005Hx00 \u0006exp\u0007i\u0001k\u0001 \u00b7 r\u0001 \u2212 \u0002t\u0002\b with k\u0001 = \u0005\n0\nky\nkz\u0001\n\u0006 = \u0005 0ky\n\u2212 ikz\n\u0006 .\nAs we are only interested in states confined to the interface\nregion, we have defined kz\u0001=\u2212ikz with kz real and positive to\nensure that the field decays to the left in the metal.

Although the approach is somewhat\nmore involved than the method used in our previous work,8,9\nit can be straightforwardly extended to deal with interfaces\nwith two-dimensional \u00012D\u0002 structures. At frequency \u0002 the\ncomplex band-structure method gives the x component of the\nH field to be of the form\nHx\nBR\u0001r\u0001,t\u0002 = \t\ng\nHg exp\u0001ikyy\u0002exp\u0007i\u0001kz\nPBG + g\u0002z\bexp\u0001\u2212 i\u0002t\u0002\nwhere the Hg are the H-field Fourier coefficients and the\nsummation is over the reciprocal-lattice vectors of the infi-\nnite periodic 1D structure given by g=2\bn \/a, where a is the\nperiod of the Bragg stack. To ensure an appropriate surface-\nconfined state we only consider solutions in which \u0002 is\nwithin the PBG of the structure, and the z-component wave\nvector, kz\nPBG\n, describes a field that decays to the right within\nthe Bragg stack. Matching the tangential \u0001x\u0002 components of\nthe H fields in the metal and in the Bragg reflector at the\ninterface z=0 gives\nHx = \t\ng\nHg.\nMatching the tangential \u0001y\u0002 component of the E fields at the\ninterface then leads to the additional requirement that\ni\n\u0002\u00070kz\nk2\nHx = \u2212\n1\n\u0002\u00060\n\t\ng,g\u0001\nHg\u0006g\u0001\n\u22121\u0001kz\nPBG + g\u0002 ,\nwhere the Fourier expansion\n1\n\u0006\u0001z\u0002\n= \t\ng\u0001\n\u0006g\u0001\n\u22121\nexp\u0001ig\u0001z\u0002\nhas been used to represent the inverse of the relative permit-\ntivity as a function of position within the Bragg stack.

RESULTS\nWe have carried out calculations for a specific semi-\ninfinite Bragg reflector with alternate layers of GaAs \u0001rela-\ntive permittivity=13.69, refractive index n=3.7\u0002 and AlAs\n\u0001relative permittivity=9, refractive index=3\u0002, a period of a\n=1.87\t10\u22127 m, and a first PBG between 0.933 and 1.067\neV \u0001for zero in-plane wave vector, ky =0\u0002, centered at 1 eV.\nThe photon energy range of the PBG is below the electronic\nband gaps of bulk AlAs and GaAs and hence the materials\nare assumed to be transparent to light at the frequencies of\ninterest. An interface plasmon-polariton state can only be\nfound if the Bragg reflector surface layer adjacent to the\nmetal is the lower refractive index material, AlAs. This can\nbe understood in terms of the argument presented by Ka-\nvokin et al.5 and Kaliteevski et al.,8 where it was noted that\nin order to obtain a confined state in a cavity composed of a\nleft reflector with amplitude reflection coefficient rL and right\nreflector with reflection coefficient rR, it is necessary that\nrLrR=1. For reflection from the Bragg stack on the right with\na low index first layer material there is zero phase shift \u0001see\nKavokin et al.5\u0002 and rR\u00041 near the center of the photonic\nband gap \u0001rR\u0004\u22121 and the phase shift is \b with the higher\nindex material at the interface\u0002. For reflection from the metal\non the left with \u0002 very close to but above \u0002p, the phase shift\nis near zero and rL\u00041 near the critical angle, which is close\nto zero in this case due to the small refractive index of the\nmetal just above the plasma frequency. Thus rLrR=1 per-\ntains, as required. Note that in the case considered by Kali-\nteevski et al.,8 where \u0002\u0004\u0002p, the reflection from the metal\ngives rL\u0004\u22121 and the reverse scenario with the larger refrac-\ntive index Bragg stack layer at the interface is required in\norder to obtain a surface state below the plasma frequency. It\nis also worth pointing out that in the situation where two\nmetallic layers form the interface with, say, \u0002p\nR\u0005\u0002p\nL\n, there is\nno interface state with \u0002p\nL\u0004\u0002\u0004\u0002p\nR because rLrR\u0004\u22121 in this\ncase.\nThe solutions of Eqs. \u00012\u0002 and \u00013\u0002 are obtained by carrying\nout the frequency scans described and are shown for both\nTM and TE polarizations in Fig. 2 together with the associ-\nated free space light line. The key result is that there exist\nsurface plasmon-polariton solutions for both TM and TE po-\nlarizations which lie above the bulk plasma frequency of the\nmetal. The dispersion curves for both the TM and TE modes\nare near parabolic and, for the range of results shown, are\nmainly within the light line, indicating that in a finite struc-\nture the associated modes are accessible to direct excitation\nby incident radiation without the need for prism coupling.\nIn support of the above results we have also performed\nstandard transfer-matrix calculations of the power reflection\nand transmission coefficients of finite structures consisting of\na metallic layer on the surface of a 20 period AlAs\/GaAs\nBragg reflector grown on a GaAs substrate. As an example,\nwe choose an in-plane wave vector ky =0.15\t2\b \/a, just\nwithin the light line for the energies considered. For this\nin-plane wave vector the PBG of the infinite Bragg stack is\nbetween 0.99 and 1.10 eV for the TM polarization and 0.97\nto 1.11 eV for TE polarization. The corresponding energies\nfor the TM and TE plasmon-polariton modes at this wave\nvector are 1.042 eV \u0001free space wave vector k=0.1573\n\t2\b \/a\u0002 and 1.079 eV \u0001free space wave vector k=0.1629\n\t2\b \/a\u0002, respectively, and we thus expect to see appropriate\nfeatures in the reflectivity near these energies when the inci-\ndent angles in free space are 72.47\u00b0 and 67.06\u00b0 to the normal\nof the interface, respectively.\nThe results for the reflection coefficient, R, as a function\nof metal overlayer thickness are shown in Fig. 3 for both the\nTM and TE polarizations. In the case of the TM results, it\ncan be seen that for the larger layer thickness of 200 nm the\nreflectivity drops sharply to almost zero \u0001and there is a cor-\nresponding rise in the transmission, which is not shown here\u0002\nat an energy just above 1.04 eV, which is in excellent agree-\nment with the infinite metal overlayer dispersion curve re-\nsults. The full width at half maximum of the transmission\npeak is 2.4\t10\u22124 eV. As the thickness of the layer is re-\nduced and becomes insufficient to confine the interface state\neffectively, the reflectivity minimum increases and broadens\nand shifts to lower energy, with corresponding changes in the\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 The TM \u0001H field entirely parallel to the\ninterface\u0002 and TE \u0001E field entirely parallel to interface\u0002 plasmon-\npolariton dispersion curves for the structure shown in Fig. 1.

For the TE polarization a similar\ntrend can be seen. For a metal layer of thickness 800 nm a\nvery narrow dip is observed in the reflection coefficient, giv-\ning a corresponding near 100% transmission at an energy\njust below 1.08 eV, as expected from the infinite metal over-\nlayer calculations. Again, as the thickness is reduced the re-\nflectivity dip becomes less marked, broadens, and moves to\nlower energies. Similar results can be observed in both po-\nlarizations for lower energy states \u0001corresponding to smaller\nin-plane wave vector and smaller angles of incidence\u0002, but\nthicker metallic overlayers are then required in order to ob-\ntain comparably narrow spectral features. The decay length\nof the electromagnetic field in the metal is similar for the two\npolarizations \u0001although somewhat larger for TE\u0002 and thus the\ndifferent behaviors of the TM and TE modes, in particular\nthe metal overlayer width dependence, are largely a conse-\nquence of the boundary conditions at the interface.\nTo consider the effect on the spectra of losses in the me-\ntallic layer, we have carried out calculations with different\nvalues of the collision frequency, \u0002c. As the losses are larger\nin the case of the TE polarization, due to the larger metal\noverlayer widths required to produce sharp features, we con-\nsider only the more favorable TM case, which is likely to be\nmore readily observed in experiment. The results are shown\nin Fig. 4 for a metal layer thickness of 50 nm and an angle of\nincidence of 72.47\u00b0. As the collision frequency is increased\nfrom zero \u0001curve a\u0002, corresponding to the original results in\nFig. 3, up to a maximum value of \u0002c=1\t1014 rad s\u22121\n\u0001which is somewhat larger than the value for gold employed\nin previous calculations,8 \u0002c\u00044.1\t1013 rad s\u22121\u0002, there is an\ninitial trend to a deeper but broader reflectivity minimum,\nbut for the largest \u0002c modeled \u0001curve d\u0002, there is a very broad\nfeature which is still clearly visible above the energy corre-\nsponding to the bulk plasma frequency. In the latter case our\ncalculations show that there is negligible transmission\nthrough the structure and 1-R very nearly equates to the\nlosses due to absorption within the metal. For the lower \u0002c\nvalues, significant transmission can be observed although, in\ngeneral, the dip in reflectivity is associated with a corre-\nsponding loss peak for the structure.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, we have presented a series of model calcu-\nlations to demonstrate the existence of surface plasmon-\npolariton modes and their associated reflectivity features\nabove the bulk plasma frequency at the interface between a\nBragg stack and a metallic layer. The key conditions required\nto obtain such states are that the bulk plasma frequency must\nlie within the photonic band gap of the Bragg stack, Eq. \u00011\u0002\nmust be satisfied, and the low refractive index material must\nbe adjacent to the metallic surface. The linewidth of the\nstates is significantly broadened when the finite conductivity\nof the metal is taken into account but the consequence of the\npresence of such states is nevertheless clearly visible in the\nreflection spectra. Although we have considered a particular\nmodel system the results should be more generally valid pro-\nvided that the required conditions are satisfied.\n1 I. E. Tamm, Phys. Z.
