These include communication systems (email,\ndiscussion boards, synchronous chat), authoring and assessment tools, as well as inte-\ngrated learning environments such as Blackboard and WebCT. Coupled with this,\nthere is now a range of tools to facilitate information management including commer-\ncial products and subject-specific information gateways. Despite this, there is\nevidence of slow uptake in the use of these technologies within education (Jones,\n1996). Britain and Liber (1999, p. 3) conclude that: \namongst the factors that are slowing the uptake [is] \u2026 the lack of a coherent framework\nwithin which to evaluate both the pedagogical benefits and the organizational changes\nrequired to effectively implement it.\nFurthermore evaluation research to date shows that it is difficult to encourage authen-\ntic virtual learning or collaboration.

Collaborative group work needs to be set up carefully and orchestrated\nto achieve desired results and, despite this, may still end up as a rather stilted collab-\noration exercise not comparable with direct face-to-face equivalent group work\n(Jones, 1999). Integrated learning environments are still predominantly used as\n\u2018shells\u2019 for displaying web pages and rarely get beyond basic information dissemina-\ntion and administration (Thomas & Wyatt, 1999). With respect to information seek-\ning and handling, the sheer volume available to learners\/researchers is increasing\nexponentially, unmatched by the sophistication of the searching and handling tools\n(Lawrence & Lee Giles, 1999). Information overload, coupled with confusion of\nwhere to look, is increasingly problematic and, despite a growth in the range of\nsearching tools and portals, it is not evident that the right information is being\ndispatched to the right users in a timely and quality assured fashion (Conole, 2002).\nResearch into the use of ICT has increased significantly in the last decade and there\nis evidence that learning technology as a research discipline is now beginning to\nmature (Conole et al., 2003). However, research still tends to focus on particular case\nstudies rather than the development of underpinning theories and approaches\n(Conole, 2004). Furthermore, little is understood about the \u2018affordances\u2019 of different\ntechnologies and, more specifically, how these properties might be exploited in partic-\nular learning and teaching contexts. We believe that a better understanding of the\nnature and properties of technologies will lead to a more systematic application of the\nuse of ICT for learning and teaching. This paper attempts to draw out these inherent\nproperties building on Gibson\u2019s concept of affordances (Gibson, 1979) and Beck\u2019s\nunderstanding of risk (Beck, 1992).\nThe paper outlines the current developments in ICT research and the associated\nperspectives and views. The notion of affordances is described, as well as ways in\nwhich it might be used to develop a better understanding of the properties of different\ntechnologies. We argue that there is a need to explore a theoretical basis for the use\nof ICTs and present a conceptual framework as an attempt to further explore the\nnotions of affordances in this respect. The research methodology used and the social\ntheory on which the paper draws, are then described. The paper concludes with\nsuggestions for further research.\nCurrent perspectives on technologies\u2014myths and realities\nThe best example of the increased use and importance of ICT is the now ubiquitous\nuse of the PC as a work tool and the replacement of many traditional work modes of\ncommunication, such as memos, with online communication via email. There has been\na commensurate growth in the use of technology to support learning, fuelled by the\nincreased use of all-in-one software such as virtual learning environments. There has\nalso been a growth in the amount and variety of resources to support learning and\nresearch, through specialized gateways and portals, and niche resource providers. The\ntypes of software tools, hardware systems and online environments have also increased\nin variety and complexity, with tools now available to support everything from research\npublication management to online assessment and monitoring.\n Affordances of information and communication technologies\n \n115\n          These developments have been met by a spectrum of views, ranging from wholesale\nacceptance and calls for pedagogical re-engineering and revolutionizing educational\nsystems, through to significant dissent and cynicism about the use and value of these\nnew tools. In addition, there are growing concerns about the unintended consequences\nof these changes, such as potential job losses, fears of increased surveillance methods\nand associated ethical questions (Bonk, 2001; Borgman, 2001; Schuck, 2001; Land\n& Bayne, 2001; McKenna, 2002). The hegemony within this continuum of views has\nebbed and flowed over the last decade, as outputs from research have accumulated to\nsupport different perspectives, and as the population in general becomes more e-liter-\nate and comfortable with using the technologies. The variety of ways in which tech-\nnologies can be used to support learning and teaching, and the enabling tools and\nresources available to support this process, have increased significantly. However,\nevidence suggests that practitioners are still unclear about how to use technology\nappropriately, and its application is often based on common sense rather then being\ntheoretically informed by pedagogical theory (Conole et al., 2004). One reason for the\nlack of application of models and theories by e-learning practitioners may be that, as\nacademics outside the field of education, they find the diverse array of theoretical\nperspectives alien and overwhelming (McNaught, 2003). One important stakeholder\nin this respect are learning technologists, who work with academics and teaching prac-\ntitioners to exploit new technologies. These \u2018new professionals\u2019 frequently have a very\ngood grasp of current theories and models for e-learning and have the skills to support\nthose academic staff who are less familiar with pedagogical theory.\nA taxonomy of ICT affordances\nThis section defines the notion of affordances and outlines a taxonomy of ICT affor-\ndances with a description of each. Salomon describes Gibson\u2019s concept of affordances\nas follows. \n\u2018Affordance\u2019 refers to the perceived and actual properties of a thing, primarily those func-\ntional properties that determine just how the thing could possibly be used. (Salomon,\n1993, p. 51)\nSalomon goes on to describe how Norman has developed this concept and, in partic-\nular, the notion that the affordances of many objects (such as microwaves, car instru-\nments, etc.) often restrict their accessibility to users, arguing that better design of\nartefacts would make it easier to accomplish certain functions. We argue that this\ncould be developed further and, when applied to current ICT applications, can have\nboth positive and negative impacts on the users. Pea builds on this in terms of the\nconcept of \u2018Person Plus\u2019, which is the concept of cognition being distributed between\nthe person and their environment, and associated artefacts (Pea, 1998).\nApplication of the concept of affordances centres around three main research ques-\ntions: \n\u0002 How might the affordances of technologies be articulated?\n\u0002 Can these be developed into a taxonomy for ICT?\n 116\n \nG. Conole & M. Dyke\n            \u0002 How might a critical knowledge and understanding of such affordances be used to\nsupport learning and teaching?\nFirstly, relevant current social theory and critique were analysed to establish the key\nfeatures of modernity and, where relevant, to map this specifically to ICT. In partic-\nular, we have drawn on the work of Giddens (1990, 1991) on late modernity,\nCastells\u2019 work on the nature of the networked society (Castells, 1996), and\nEngestrom\u2019s critique of activity theory (Engestrom et al., 1999). Secondly, the litera-\nture on the current use of technologies was analysed. From this analysis a list of the\npotential themes and commonalities was drawn up and distilled into a taxonomy of\nICT affordances, which is outlined below.\nAccessibility\nThe range of ICT now available offers relatively easy access to vast amounts of infor-\nmation through a variety of different mechanisms. Online access is possible via gate-\nways, portals and websites as well as via knowledge networks and shared communities\nof users. However, the corollary of this is that there has been an exponential increase\nin the amount of information and the means of accessing it, which leads to issues of\ninformation overload, quality assurance and the need for more critical evaluation.\nThis will require a change in the users\u2019 learning and information analysing skills. The\nchallenge is not in accessing material, but rather in knowing how to use what is avail-\nable. Perhaps the balance has shifted from \u2018searching\u2019 to \u2018selecting\u2019.\nSpeed of change\nAn element of the late-modern perspective adopted here, is the information society\ndiscourse, where abundant and rapidly changing information is mediated through\nextensive communication technologies (Castells, 1996). Giddens acknowledges the\nimportance of information in guiding decision-making: \nSocial reflexivity refers to a world increasingly constituted by information rather than pre-\ngiven modes of conduct. It is how we live after the retreat of tradition and nature, because\nwe have to take so many forward orientated decisions. In that sense, we live in a much\nmore reflexive way than previous generations have done. (Giddens, 1999a, p. 15)\nContinuous reassessment of experiences, and also of the information which is part of\nthese experiences, is therefore central to living with the rapid change of late-moder-\nnity. Earlier forms of modernity could more frequently use custom and tradition to\nguide action. The immediacy of access to rapidly changing information or events is a\ncore feature of new technologies, enabling unprecedented speed of access to materials\nand world events as they happen. However, this speed can also raise issues about\nquality, lack of authority of sources and lack of reflection. The speed of change may\nalso mitigate against reflective and critical thought, fostering surface approaches to\nlearning. Reflection as an affordance will be considered below. The issue here is that\nthe speed of change in a world full of conflicting and changing information, is a\nchallenge for the educational use of the new technologies. In other words, how can it\n Affordances of information and communication technologies\n \n117\n           be used to enable students to navigate their way through the myriad of changing infor-\nmation and make more informed decisions?\nDiversity\nICT offers access to a vast range of diverse and different experiences that can inform\nlearning such as overseas web sites, access to subject experts, or use of simulations to\nreplicate complex behaviour. Exposure to the experience of others is a key ingredient\nto effective learning and a potential affordance of ICT.\nThe work of Boud (1993) and his colleagues defines learning as a holistic activity\nthat needs to connect with people\u2019s life experiences. Learning is recognized as\nconstructed in a social, economic and cultural context. Boud emphasized the value of\nlearning from the experience of others, of sharing experience and exposing ideas to\nthe critical gaze of the \u2018other\u2019. He argued: \nWe also need to be challenged so that we do not fool ourselves with our own distorted\nassumptions or fail to consider new information which is outside our present range of\nexperience. (Boud et al., 1993, p. 15)\nInformation technologies provide a means by which people can be exposed to expe-\nriences very different to their own and extend their experience beyond their own\ncommunities. Experience of the \u2018other\u2019 through technology raises issues around\nauthenticity and power in the \u2018virtual reality\u2019 that can be accessed. For example, there\nmay be disjuncture between the mediated \u2018reported\u2019 experience and the reality of\nlived experience. It raises questions about how one distinguishes between what is real\nand what is rendered real via the technology.\nCommunication and collaboration\nThe communication and collaborative abilities of technology present another key\naffordance that offers the potential for learning enriched by engagement with the\n\u2018other\u2019. New technologies have opened up the possibility of new forms of dialogue\nand communication. ICT offers the potential to develop new forms of online commu-\nnities and new means of communicating and sharing information, from signing up to\nparticular mailing lists through to involvement in specialized discussion forums and\nchat rooms. The engagement with difference and the acknowledgement of diversity\nthrough communicative discourse connects with critical social theory and the Haber-\nmasian idea of ideal speech situations (Habermas, 1970). The importance to learning\nis documented in Vygotsky\u2019s approaches to learning (Engestrom et al., 1999). This\nalso aligns well with Wenger\u2019s notion of Communities of Practice (Wenger, 1998).\nHowever, this can lead to issues in terms of individuals being \u2018spread too thinly\u2019\nacross communities, as well as issues of lack of identity and peripheral engagement.\nBauman presents a pessimistic view of modernity where: \nUnable to stop treading on each others toes in the mega-community, we have stepped into\nour separate houses and closed the door, and then stepped into our separate rooms and\nclosed the door. (Bauman, 1995, p. 45)\n 118\n \nG. Conole & M. Dyke\n            But this can also raise questions about the communication and literacy skills of end\nusers. Issues and concerns about the e-literacy of both staff and students are currently\nbeing debated through a series of symposia organized by the Joint Information\nSystems Committee JISC.1\nReflection\nAsynchronous technologies (in particular) offer the potential for encouraging reflec-\ntion and critique, with users engaging in discussions over a longer time frame than is\npossible in face-to-face discussions. In addition, users are able to access and build on\narchived material available from earlier discussion. Asynchronous technologies have\nbeen used successfully, particularly in the use of discussion forums to support learn-\ning, but are also being used increasingly to support the research and teaching activities\nof academic staff. Clearly, there is nothing inherent about ICT that nurtures reflec-\ntion\u2014the key is how it is used. ICT has the potential to enable reflection and criticality\nto be enhanced. It presents new opportunities for knowledge claims to be considered\nand subjected to the critical gaze of much wider and more diverse communities of\npractice. Recently we have begun to look at this in more detail and have developed a\nmap of learning theories against specific learning characteristics such as reflection and\ncollaboration (Conole et al., 2004). We are now using this as a basis to develop a\nlearning design toolkit which aims to provide a more explicit and pedagogically\ngrounded use of tools and resources, as part of the JISC\/NSF-funded DialogPlus\nproject.2\nThere is, equally, a risk that the speed and pace of information change outlined\nabove militates against reflection. It leaves no space for contemplation and considered\njudgement, and promotes a more pragmatic, reflexive immediate response to new\ninformation, as it is pixilated across our screens. This can be said to be particularly\ntrue of email, where nowadays users are bombarded with so much information that\nthere is a tendency to skim read and adopt a surface approach in terms of reacting to\nresponses and requests (Gibbs, 1992). This view is presented in Lash\u2019s \u2018Critique of\nInformation\u2019 (Lash, 2002). Perhaps new forms of reflection and critique will emerge\nin response to more transitory and digital text. Though, as Bauman\u2019s (2000) analogy\nof \u2018liquid modernity\u2019 suggests, the shape and form might change. The issue is whether\nthe essential ingredients of modernity, or in our case, learning through technology,\nremain the same? At a political level, there is evidence that globalization has nurtured,\nrather than stifled, critical reflection and resistance (Klein, 2001; Stiglitz, 2002;\nMonbiot, 2003). The challenge, as Laurillard (2002) notes, is how we can use ICT\nto transform information into \u2018knowledge\u2019, a process which has parallels in Dewey\u2019s\n(1933) advocacy of critical reflection upon experience to create knowledge.\nMultimodal and non-linear\nThe non-linearity of the web (epitomized by hypertext and the use of powerful search\nengines) leads to the potential for different routes through, and forms of, learning.\n Affordances of information and communication technologies\n \n119\n    ICT enables the learner to move beyond linear pathways of learning, characteristic of,\nbut not exclusive to, behaviourist approaches, and to adopt more individualized strat-\negies and pathways. Dewey\u2019s (1933) pragmatic approach to experiential learning is\nmore characteristic of non-linear learning achievable with ICT than that of the more\nprescriptive learning cycle of Kolb (1984). Another affordance of ICT is the potential\nfor multi-modal and non-linear approaches to learning. Yet much current computer-\nbased training material still appears to follow a linear, assembly line, mode of learn-\ning. Many \u2018e-learning\u2019 packages are built on behaviourist principles of atomized expe-\nriences that need to be completed in a specified order before the individual is\npositively reinforced and permitted to move on\u2014a form of electronic page-turning.\nThe issue may be whether there is a stark contrast between the method of learning\npromoted with many computer-based tutorial packages, and the experimental and\npragmatic way in which most people acquire for themselves skills in ICT. Multimodal\nand non-linear learning modes are perhaps an under-utilized affordance of ICT.\nRisk, fragility and uncertainty\nAnthony Giddens argues that the concept of risk is central to our understanding of\ncontemporary modernity. Giddens defines risk as being different from dangers or\nhazards in that they are essentially related to the impact of humanity on the world and\nrelate to the consequences of our actions in our world. Risk, therefore, is different\nfrom fate or \u2018natural\u2019 disasters, it relates to choices people make about avoiding risks\nor taking them. \nManufactured risk means human risk environments, or human environments of uncer-\ntainty, created by the very changes I discussed in the last lecture, created partly by the\nadvance of science and technology. (Giddens, 1999b, p. 5)\nConnected to risk are the unintended consequences of actions (Giddens, 1990,\n1999a). These concepts are particularly pertinent to the context of information tech-\nnologies, where history shows that there have been major unintended consequences,\ni.e. the technologies have not necessarily been taken up or used in the ways originally\nintended. Furthermore, another aspect of the rapidly changing nature of ICT is that\nthere is an intrinsic level of fragility in digital technologies and networks. These\ncomplex systems are vulnerable to abuses, to disruption from viruses and SPAM, or\nsimply to the servers \u2018being down\u2019. The increased use of technologies by different\ngroups of users often gives rise to unintended consequences. For example, the\nincrease in the volume of information available on the web has led to new forms of\nplagiarism. Ubiquitous use of email has resulted in increasing commercial exploita-\ntion and unwelcome mail. There are risks and levels of uncertainty associated with a\ndependence and reliance on the instantaneous provision of information and commu-\nnication. The intensification of work (Pollert, 1991) and need for immediacy associ-\nated with the \u2018flexibility\u2019 presented by information and communication technologies,\ncan result in levels of dependence whereby an individual\u2019s success or failure in meet-\ning commitments hangs by a tenuous digital thread.\n 120\n \nG. Conole & M. Dyke\n         Immediacy\nThe speed with which information can be exchanged via the web and email has led to\na shift in user expectations in terms of response times to requests from other users.\nThis, in turn, has led to a consequential intensification of working patterns, with users\nbeing increasingly required to respond almost immediately to requests which, in the\npast, would have been dealt with over longer timeframes.\nMonopolization\nConvergence and divergence of different technologies is increasingly important, lead-\ning to issues associated with scalability and globalization and the underpinning stan-\ndards needed to support interoperability. A current focus is also on a critique of\nconvergence verses standardization across the technical, pedagogical, human and\norganizational aspects. There is a tension between the benefits of diversification and\nsharing of developments, a central ethos of the open source community with that of\nmonopolization and co-modification, such as the dominance of particular software\nproducts to support office applications.\nSurveillance\nNew technologies present new Foucauldian means by which those with power can\nextend their gaze and secure greater knowledge and control over others (Foucault,\n1979). There is increasing concern about potential infringements on individuals\nwhich the infiltration of technological applications make possible. Land and Bayne\n(2001), for example, have critiqued the increased default inclusion of monitoring\ntools within virtual learning environments that mean teachers have the power to\nmonitor student activities more closely than ever before. McKenna (2002) critiques\nthe use of the blind copying function in email being used as a potential power tool\nunknown to recipients of the main email. Similar concerns are being voiced about\nmany of the new \u2018smart\u2019 devices and personal tags which are being included in\ncommercial products that enable providers to target and personalize products more\naccurately. There are concerns about how these tracking devices might be used for\nother purposes (such as surveillance) or by other agents.\nApplication of the taxonomy\nThe proposed taxonomy of ICT affordances can then be used in a number of ways: \n\u0002 To carry out further analysis, critique and development of the taxonomy frame-\nwork against relevant theory and practical use.\n\u0002 To establish a clearer understanding of the affordances which should help to inform\npractitioners in their use of particular technologies to achieve particular goals.\n Affordances of information and communication technologies\n \n121\n                              \u0002 To identify potential limitations and inappropriate uses of the technologies.\n\u0002 To act as a discussion point for critique and further refinement.\n\u0002 To offer a checklist to help practitioners understand costs and benefits of different\ntechnologies.\n\u0002 To use as a mechanism for staff development and improving practice \u2013 for exam-\nple, by providing a checklist of potential benefits and draw backs of different tech-\nnologies which can be used to inform choice and the ways that practitioners might\nchoose to use them.\nMany of the affordances outlined above are known intuitively, but the development\nof an explicit taxonomy provides a basis for discussion, critique, and further refine-\nment. This may involve questions such as: \n\u0002 Are these the only affordances?\n\u0002 Does their articulation make the benefits and potential drawbacks of technologies\nmore explicit?\n\u0002 Can particular affordances be mapped to particular types of technologies?\nWe believe that the taxonomy will be useful as a checklist for practitioners, to help\nthem make informed decisions about the use of different technologies. It may also, in\npart, help to make them more aware of the properties of different tools and resources,\nand use this as part of their decision making process in developing learning activities\nand teaching plans. We are also considering how this might be used as part of a wider\nlearning design process. This might involve integrating the use of technologies with\nother teaching methods, tools and resources, through the development of a learning\ndesign toolkit, which aims to enable practitioners to map particular pedagogical\napproaches to their learning design (Conole et al., 2004).\nDiscussion\nThis paper has considered whether application of the concept of affordances might\nenable better use and understanding of technologies and their application to learning\nand teaching. However, this approach leaves a number of unresolved questions. \n\u0002 How valuable is the concept of affordances and does its application provide any\nreally new insight into the inherent properties of technologies?\n\u0002 How valid is the methodological approach suggested?\n\u0002 What other approaches might be taken?\n\u0002 The approach suggested reflects a particular interpretation of social theory. Is this\na limitation and might a broader analysis of other social theories yield new insights?\n\u0002 Practitioners are still exploring the potential of new technologies, and the current\nuses of technologies often do not take full advantage of the medium. Therefore,\nhow can practice take full advantage of the affordances of ICT?\n\u0002 Does understanding of the affordances actually get us closer to improvement in\npractice and is this a useful framework?\n 122\n \nG. Conole & M. Dyke\n                         A fundamental issue is the level of granularity at which this taxonomy might be appro-\npriate; is the taxonomy useful as a philosophical critique of the inherent affordances\nof ICT at a general level or can it be used more explicitly in terms of actually mapping\nto particular uses. Our work in the development of the learning design toolkit as part\nof the DialogPlus project is exploring this issue.2 To address these questions we\nintend to examine the issues further and discuss these ideas with researchers. In addi-\ntion, we plan to test out the use of the taxonomy in the ways outlined above with prac-\ntitioners. These activities should help practitioners to refine and develop the\ntaxonomy and to give a clearer insight into its potential use. We believe that this\napproach is timely given that there has been little done in the application of the\nconcept of affordances to date in learning technology and given the increased diversity\nand potential applications of learning technologies.\nBy making the affordances explicit in the form of a taxonomy it will be possible for\npractitioners to make more informed choices about the ways in which different tech-\nnologies can be used. As a next stage we plan to assign different affordances to specific\ntechnologies to provide a mapping of the potential applications of different technolo-\ngies. This we hope will provide a mechanism for identifying the strengths and weak-\nnesses of different technologies and the ways they can be used. For example a\nmapping of the communication and reflection affordances to asynchronous and\nsynchronous communication mechanisms will reveal that both have strengths in\nterms of supporting communication, but that the latter may also have greater poten-\ntial to nurture critical and reflective thinking.\nNotes\n1. www.jisc.ac.uk\n2. www.dialogplus.org\nReferences\nBauman, Z.
