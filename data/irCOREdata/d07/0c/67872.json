Hyperion CDA67475.\nThe world premi\u00e8re in June 2003 of Sir John\nTavener\u2019s seven-hour all-night vigil The Veil of the\nTemple provided one of the most memorable and\npowerful musical experiences of recent years. For\nthe composer, it marked the culmination of a\ngradual turning away from Orthodox religion\ntowards a broader approach to religious beliefs.\nThis new-found ecumenism has inspired a series\nof large-scale choral pieces, which communicate\na palpable sense of joy and radiance, as well as\nexpanding Tavener\u2019s orchestral palette to include\nsuch instruments as the powwow drum and\nTibetan temple bowl.\nRCA\u2019s release of The Veil of the Temple is a\nconcert-length version, first heard at the 2004\nProms. Accommodated on two CDs and lasting\njust two hours, the recording is taken from the\nmemorable first performances, whose unique\natmosphere and magical sense of theatre and\nritual is faithfully captured on the discs. Without\nthe visual splendour of the 800-year-old Temple\nChurch, the candles and the incense, inevitably\nthe scale and sheer audacity of the original\nenterprise is diminished, but there are plenty of\nbreathtakingly beautiful and spiritually intense\nmoments here \u2013 notably the four sublime sections\nTavener is now transcribing into Anthems and the\nhauntingly memorable version of The Jesus Prayer\nwhich recurs throughout, acting, as the composer\nputs it \u2013 as the \u2018heartbeat\u2019 of the work. The choral\ncontributions, under the expert and inspiring\nguidance of Stephen Layton, are both assured and\nfervent. Even listeners implacably unconvinced\nby Tavener\u2019s music should seek out this\nremarkable piece. I hope some enterprising\nrecord company will one day have the courage\nand vision to release a full version with these\nartists, preferably also on DVD in the Temple\nChurch, whose physical spaces are built into the\nvery fabric of the score. \nSince the first performance of The Veil,\nStephen Layton has continued to champion\nTavener tirelessly, both in the concert hall and in\nthe recording studio. A collection of choral works\nwith Polyphony, recently released on the\nHyperion label, is by far the most satisfying and\nartistically impressive of the many collections of\nTavener\u2019s music. Thanks to a combination of\nidiomatic interpretations by artists who know and\nunderstand the composer\u2019s vision, and a natural\nand wide-ranging recording, the strength and\nintegrity of Tavener\u2019s music shines through with\npersuasive conviction. The artlessly moving\nspiritual vistas opened up by the harmonic\ntransformations of Birthday Sleep (1999) are\ndeveloped further in Schuon Hymen (2003) and\nShunya (2003), which inhabit the same ecstatic,\nprimal sound-world as The Veil of the Temple. All\nthe pieces on this immensely satisfying disc are\ninterpreted with simple dedication.\nSome of the works on the Hyperion CD were\ngiven by the same performers at the composer\u2019s\nlavish 60th birthday concert at the Barbican in\nNovember 2004. The world premi\u00e8re of the\nevening was provided by Pratrirupa (a Sanskrit\nword meaning \u2018reflection\u2019) performed by the\nEnglish Chamber Orchestra with Ralf Gothoni as\nconductor\/soloist. This 45-minute piece for\npiano and strings was not a \u2018concerto\u2019, but rather\na series of contrasting sections growing\norganically at each repetition, in which the two\nmusical forces mirrored each other. The main\nmaterial consisted of a dignified Hindu dirge-like\ntheme of delicate beauty and a manically jazzy\npiano figure initially clenched at either extreme of\nthe keyboard, which then proceeded via\nchromatic chords in contrary motion to meet in\nthe middle. It is not Tavener\u2019s custom to develop\nhis material in the conventionally Western sense,\nbut rather to build up an accumulation of details,\nincreasing in intensity. Whereas this procedure\nwas successful with a piece on the scale of The\nVeil, it seemed less convincing in this shorter\nstructure. This felt like one of Tavener\u2019s less\ncompelling recent creations; perhaps conventional\nmusical forces are no longer really suited to his\ndevotional utterances.\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773\n55Tempo 59 (234) 55\u201374 \u00a9 2005 Cambridge University Press\nDOI: 10.1017\/S004029820500032X Printed in the United Kingdom\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe concert also featured the London\npremi\u00e8re of Supernatural Songs (2002), settings of\nW.B. Yeats for mezzo-soprano, strings, powwow\ndrum and Hindu temple bowl. Sarah Connolly,\nreplacing an indisposed Susan Graham at short\nnotice, brought a ravishing tone and sure\ntechnique, fully deserving the fulsome applause\nshe received. The songs constitute one of the\ncomposer\u2019s finest achievements: the glorious,\nsoaring violin theme arched over sonorous,\ncosmic bass-instrument chord-changes in his\nsetting of O Do Not Love Too Long displayed\nsomething of John Barry\u2019s melodic gift, while the\nconcluding, ravishingly tender meditation on\ndeath, Where there is nothing (there is God) was\ninspired: this was music which truly sounded\n\u2018from the other side\u2019 in its primordial simplicity.\nStephen Layton conducted with great empathy\nand passion. \nTwo Mystical Love Songs by Tavener, both\nlasting around 50 minutes, stand out among his\npost-Veil compositions. Lament for Jerusalem,\nrecently released on the ABC Classics disc listed\nabove, uses both Christian and Islamic texts. It has\na formal simplicity sustained by a hypnotically\nmeasured pace and a pure musical language\nwhich ranges from the ecstatic in the choruses to\nthe sublime in Patricia Rozario\u2019s contributions,\nwhich achieve a Mozartian grace and innocence.\nSomething of the sublime transcendence of The\nVeil touches Tavener\u2019s Lament, but, as befits a love\nsong, it is a much more intimate and personal\nstatement.  \nThe Radio 3 broadcast of the world premi\u00e8re\nof Tavener\u2019s Hymn of Dawn, with Stephen Layton\nconducting the Ulster Orchestra,1 revealed it to\nhave strong links with The Veil, both in the exotic\norchestration and in the actual musical material.\nThe use of flute and violin as well as soloists adds\nvariety of expression and the work has much\nmore rhythmic and well as melodic interest than\nLament. It is more adventurous in its texts, too,\nusing Hindu, Sufi, Christian and Jewish sources. I\nhope this substantial and rewarding work will also\nappear on disc soon, preferably with the same\nforces under Stephen Layton, whose dedication\nto the score shone through every bar of this\nremarkably assured first performance.\nSir John Tavener is one of the most popular\nand oft-recorded contemporary composers, yet\nalso one of the most controversial. His spiritual\nquest for simplicity and serenity has often been\nmet with critical derision and accusations of\n\u2018dumbing down\u2019. His sheer prolificacy has\noccasionally aroused suspicions of a lack of\nquality control in his creative outpourings. Yet\nThe Veil of the Temple is a masterpiece by any\nstandards, a magnum opus which sums up\nTavener\u2019s life\u2019s work in a glorious, all-\nencompassing manner. His most recent works\npossess an artless divinity. However, they are\nextremely difficult to bring off: the supreme\nsimplicity of the language and the ritual-like\nrepetition can, if not directed with absolute\nconviction, lead easily to banality and\nstultification. Fortunately, with a musician of the\ncalibre of Stephen Layton at the helm, nothing is\npresented half-heartedly; every bar is considered\nand placed within the context of the whole. The\nlegacy of one of Britain\u2019s most distinctive and\ncommunicative contemporary composers is\nalready in safe hands.\nPaul Conway\nJOAN GUINJOAN: Concerto for clarinet and orchestra;\nConcerto for piano and orchestra; M\u00fasica per a violoncel\ni orquestra.

All have the same basic ground-\nplan (action-reflection-varied reprise-peroration)\nand testify to Guinjoan\u2019s long-term love-affair\nwith the minor third, as well as sharing specific\nelements fundamental to his musical\niconography; yet their manners and ethos are\nentirely different.\n1 29 January this year, in \u2018Hear and Now\u2019 (BBC Radio 3).\n2 For more information on this Catalan composer, see my article\nin Tempo Volume 59 No. 232 (April 2005), pp.14\u201322. There are \u2013\nat present \u2013 four other concertos in Guinjoan\u2019s catalogue: for\npiano and chamber orchestra (1963, his graduation piece from\nSchola Cantorum, Paris), for violin (1986), for bassoon with\ninstrumental octet (1989; there is a version for saxophone by\nManuel Mij\u00e1n) and for guitar (1990).

In the earlier work, the\ncello is subjected to a five-and-a-half minute\ninterrogation which throws up a range of\ntextural, motivic and tone-colour resources.\nSome of these are pulled into a tight ostinato,\nwhereupon the orchestra wakes up. Negotiations\nand accommodations between soloist and\norchestra spin the latent material into longer,\nbalanced phrases, the cello gradually spiralling to\nits highest range. A flurry of colouristic display\ndisperses the accumulated tension and the music\ndissolves, suspended and circling, into eerily\nbeautiful night sounds, tightly constructed but\nexquisitely intangible. Material from the opening\ncadenza is then reworked in the afterglow of the\nprevious section, and in an agitato coda the cello\nskirmishes with the orchestral choirs by turns.\nThe Clarinet Concerto opens to the soloist\nreflecting on a handful of pitches, dialoguing\nbetween its registers and dynamic levels. A\nsequential riff conjures the orchestra (which\nmuses on a four-note refrain in the bass), with\nwhich the soloist, flitting and swooping, swaps\nshort phrases until the orchestra commandeers\nthe opening material, establishing grounds for\nmore involved debate. The work unfolds with wit\nand grace rather than drama, but the uncluttered\ntextures and relaxed, improvisatory solo writing\nbelie the rigour of this impeccably crafted score\nmade from supple bass lines, malleable motives,\ntranslucent harmony and unforced counterpoint.\nThe structural repeat is transposed, varied and\nredistributed, and an agile coda has the soloist in\ncahoots with its orchestral counterparts.\nWeighing in at 26 minutes plus, the Piano\nConcerto (1983) is a muscular, incisive affair,\npartly because the orchestra, confronted and\nprovoked by the soloist, is not obliged to fight\nwith one arm behind its back. The piece is the\napotheosis of Guinjoan\u2019s orchestral technique\nand piano writing at the time of composition.\nIntroductory rumbling evolving into brilliant\ndisplay, the soloist\u2019s hurled staccato chords\nbecome the ritornello in a hybrid of rondo and\nvariations, complete with solo episodes\ndeveloped contrapuntally. The second main\nsection \u2013 libero \u2013 investigates Guinjoan\u2019s pianistic\nlexicon in dreamlike suspension, a dissertation on\na symmetrical diatonic figure (G F# D E C B)\nwhich is taken up by the orchestra before being\ntransformed into fleet arabesques. The\nrecapitulation \u2013 chopped, changed and reinvented\nwith the benefit of hindsight \u2013 is rounded by a\nfour-minute cadenza, and the perpetual-motion\ncoda (shades of Chopin\u2019s B minor Sonata) finally\ncollapses to the darkness of the opening, and \u2013\ndespite a defiant rally by the soloist \u2013 the work\nescapes only in the last bar from Bergian\nattenuation.\nProgramme, performance and engineering\ncombine to make this CD an excellent\nintroduction to Guinjoan\u2019s art and \u2013 for all you\nsoloists out there \u2013 a pressing invitation to get off\nthe beaten track.\nBenjamin K.

NMCD105.\nThe word nascondita (\u2018hidden\u2019) occurs twice in\nthis new release of music by Anthony Gilbert: as a\n\u2018hidden\u2019 fugue in the third movement of the\norchestral song-cycle Certain Lights Reflecting\n(1988\u20139) and, more overtly, as part of the title of\nthe first movement of his violin concerto, On\nBeholding a Rainbow (1992\u20137). This is not,\nperhaps, entirely inappropriate, as for many years\nit has been possible to think of Gilbert\u2019s many\ntalents as being somewhat hidden, mainly due to\na relative sparsity of performances. Recently,\nhowever, with the dual celebrations of his\nseventieth birthday last year in London and\nManchester, things seem to have changed and the\ncomposer himself has spoken of experiencing\nsomething of an \u2018Indian summer\u2019.\nThis CD features four of Anthony Gilbert\u2019s\nstrongest and most persuasive works: \u2026 Into the\nGyre of a Madder Dance (1994) and Unrise (2001) for\nwind ensemble, plus the already referred-to\norchestral pieces. The wind and brass music is\nboth deftly and pungently handled and receives\ncommitted performances from the RNCM Wind\nEnsemble under Clark Rundell\u2019s baton, as does\nthe violin concerto with Garry Walker steering\nAnthony Marwood and the RNCM Symphony\nOrchestra through this lyrical and ravishing work\nwith highly impressive interpretations. Indeed,\nthe sheer professionalism of the student\nperformances (in name only) come close to that\nof the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir\nAndrew Davis in the song-cycle.\nIn common with Certain Lights Reflecting, \u2026\nInto the Gyre of a Madder Dance derives its title from\nthe Lancashire-born Tasmanian poet, Sarah Day,\nand celebrates the various cyclic rotations found\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 57\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nin the natural world. Scored for triple woodwind,\nfour horns and two trumpets, the piece\njuxtaposes, then gradually reconciles, two\ncontrasting ideas and textures. Clear and logical\nin its harmonies, \u2026Into the Gyre\u2026 packs a great\ndeal into its seven minutes, whilst nodding\naffectionately to Stravinsky\u2019s ghost in passing. I\nhave written on Unrise elsewhere (Tempo No.218,\nOctober 2001, p. 34) but wish to affirm this work\u2019s\ncontinuing power, which seems as fresh as it was\nat that summer\u2019s Spitalfields Festival .\nCertain Lights Reflecting for mezzo-soprano\n(Susan Bickley, here) and orchestra sets five\npoems by Sarah Day to piquant and sensual effect.\nThis recording captures the nuances of the vocal\nline, as well as the panoply of dazzling orchestral\ncolours, in a manner that the first performance\n(Cheltenham, 1989) did not wholly achieve. As a\nresult, everything emerges with vivid clarity and\nGilbert\u2019s responses to Day\u2019s images are immed-\niately evocative and telling \u2013 the string-led cantus\nin \u2018Two Wreaths\u2019 and the hubbub of cracked,\nwhooshing quasi-fanfares in \u2018White Cockatoos\u2019,\nfor example, are just two instances of his very\nprecise and sophisticated aural imagination.\nThe climax of the CD is the performance of On\nBeholding a Rainbow, which increasingly appears\nto be Anthony Gilbert\u2019s orchestral masterpiece\n(see Tempo No.210, October 1999, p. 38). This\nintense, lyrical, almost Bergian concerto\ningeniously makes play with notions of hybrid\nforms and their resultant ambiguity, rhythmic and\ndurational cycles (micro\/macro) and a vibrant as\nwell as dramatic sense of local and long-range\ntimbral awareness. On this listening, I felt the last\nmovement to be darker than in the first\n(broadcast) performance; a hybrid of Scherzo-\ncum-Totentanz, perhaps?\nIt is difficult to think of a more timely or\ndeserved release than this one, which presents us\nwith some of the most positive, individual and\nelegant music to have been written during the\npast couple of decades. The harmonic integrities\nare self-evident, but there remain plenty of\nsubtleties to further tempt and tease the un-jaded\nmind and ear.\nRichard Leigh Harris\nMAXWELL DAVIES: Naxos Quartets Nos. 3 and 4.\nMaggini Quartet. Naxos 8.557397.\nMaxwell Davies\u2019s third quartet, as is well\ndocumented, was originally intended as an\n\u2018abstract\u2019 work exploring the potentials of\nvarious magic squares (some of which are applied\nto a plainsong); as such, it is not dissimilar in\nconception to the first two works in the cycle.\nHowever, the illegal invasion of Iraq that\noccurred during the composition of the third\nquartet left its traces in both the character and\nsubstance of the music.4 Nor was the fourth\nquartet unaffected by the conflict, for Davies\nstarted out by attempting to write a lighter,\ncontrasting work to its predecessor, only to find\nthat the same themes were to resurface.\nConsidered as a pair, they take the Naxos cycle\ninto unanticipated territories, and make for a\nfascinating, if at times uncomfortable, instalment\nin the project.\nThe start of the third Naxos Quartet does not\nimmediately reveal Davies\u2019s outrage at the Iraq\ninvasion. Indeed, compared to the expositions of\nthe first two quartets, there are significantly fewer\njuxtapositions of contrasting material, with a\ncorresponding emphasis on continuity, as well as\na much more audible sense of harmonic\ndirection. But as the movement progresses, the\nmusical surface becomes increasingly distorted,\nculminating in a savage march that is rendered\nsomewhat ridiculous by the use of complex cross\nrhythms. The way in which this evaporates into a\nbeautiful \u2018slow meditation\u2019 is vintage Maxwell\nDavies: the juxtaposition of the absurd and the\nlyrical intensifies both.\nThe slow movement continues the protest by\nmeans of the avoidance, and then subsequent\ndistortion of, the \u2018In Nomine\u2019 melody. Here too is\na re-emergence of the scherzo material left in the\n\u2018stratosphere\u2019 at the end of the first quartet, part\nof Davies\u2019s original inception of connecting\nmembers of the cycle. However, the material is\nappreciably slower in the third quartet than in the\nfirst, almost as if in the interim it had been\ncontaminated and weighed down by the external\npolitical situation. The third movement (a series\nof Inventions after Bach) expands this material,\nculminating in a nauseating \u2018hymn\u2019 in which the\nuse of slow, wide vibrato serves to exaggerate the\ngrotesquery. \nAs in the first three movements, the final fugue\nturns towards the end to contemplate Iraq, by\nmeans of allusions to the parodistic elements\nwithin the quartet as a whole. Thus although the\nquartet makes use of numerous traditional\npolyphonic genres (doubtless part of the original\nconception of the work), none of the \u2018abstract\u2019\n4 For more on this, see Rodney Lister, \u2018Peter Maxwell Davies\u2019s\n\u201cNaxos\u201d Quartets\u2019, Tempo Vol. 59 No. 232, pp. 2\u201312.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f58\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ndesigns are allowed to run their course, to find\nclosure on their own terms. The use of parody\nenables the external world to \u2018enter\u2019 and disrupt\nthe otherwise \u2018purely musical\u2019 discourse. In\nreference to the quartet (and therefore Iraq)\nDavies has commented that it is \u2018just impossible\nto neither see, nor hear\u2019 what is happening; his\nmusic is a powerful artistic response from\nsomeone who both sees and hears what is\nhappening around him.\nThe fourth Naxos Quartet is the first in the cycle\nto be cast in a single movement. Taking\nBrueghel\u2019s picture of children\u2019s games as\ninspiration, the work juxtaposes active episodes\n(representing the more exuberant children\u2019s\ngames) with slower ones (quieter pursuits). An\nopening idea encompassing a progression from F\nto B encapsulates the overall tonal argument;\ntransformations of this motion provide the warp\nand weft of the various sections. The intention is\nto provide, I assume, an underlying logic to the\notherwise capricious ordering of ideas, although\nit is not always easy to follow. More immediate is\nthe continued sense of vividly characterized\nepisodes drawing us into new expressive areas. \nIn his programme note to the work, Davies\nnotes that in thinking about children\u2019s games, he\nwas unable to avoid the underlying adult motives\nof aggression and war, and their consequences. In\nthis sense, the fourth quartet is not a lighter\ncontrast to the third, but rather a companion\npiece exploring the same dark corners of the\nhuman condition.\nThe Magginis are persuasive and responsive\ninterpreters of Davies\u2019s music; indeed, their\nrecording of the first two quartets was short-\nlisted for a Classical Brits Award. The nomination\nmay not reveal anything about the artistic\nsignificance of these works, but it nevertheless\nindicates the degree to which Davies\u2019s music is\nable to connect with a larger public than that of\nmany of his peers. Part of this connexion is\ndoubtless due to the availability of the music \u2013 the\nentrepreneurial marketing of Davies\u2019s work via\nhis MaxOpus website is, to my knowledge,\nunprecedented in its scale. (Those who like their\ncreative artists to be above such worldly concerns\nmight well pause to consider how business-\nminded composers such as Haydn and Beethoven\nmight have exploited such a resource, had it been\nan option for them.) But such an enterprise would\nnot succeed if the music had nothing to say.\nDavies\u2019s continued commitment to producing\nworks that, at their finest, address contemporary\nissues whilst communicating directly to the\naudience without compromising his musical\nvalues demands our full attention. Thus it is with\nthe Naxos Quartets: they are rigorous, (for some)\nchallenging, and immensely rewarding. Given the\nstrong recorded performances, and the budget\nprice that they have been released at, I have no\nhesitation in recommending them.\nEdward Venn \nPASCAL DUSAPIN: Perel\u00e0, uomo di fumo.

Arditti String Quartet.\nNa\u00efve MO 782125.\nPascal Dusapin has developed over the last\nquarter of a century into one of the most\ndistinctive composers in the contemporary\nmusical arena. His wide-ranging catalogue\nencompasses practically every genre from solo\npieces to large-scale operas. Four consummate\nstring quartets crown an abundance of chamber\nworks; there is some highly individual choral\nmusic, concertos demonstrating a keen\nunderstanding of the possibilities of their solo\ninstrument and an ongoing series of inventively\nscored \u2018Solos for orchestra\u2019. Opportunities to\nhear his large-scale pieces in the concert halls of\nthe United Kingdom have been all too few in\nrecent years. Fortunately, the Na\u00efve label has\nreleased many of his major works and Accord\nhave helpfully filled in other gaps in his\ndiscography, so it is possible to acquire on CD a\nrepresentative selection of his inimitable\ncontributions to all genres.\nWhichever medium he is writing for, Dusapin\ndeconstructs it thoroughly to reach the very\nessence of sounds implied by \u2018concerto\u2019 or\n\u2018quartet\u2019 or \u2018opera\u2019. His major acknowledged\ninfluences are Var\u00e8se and Xenakis, whose\nseminars at the Sorbonne Dusapin attended for\nfour years in the 1970s; yet his own sound-world is\nutterly distinctive, the result of scrupulous\ncraftsmanship and ruthless self-criticism, every\nnote compelled to justify its existence within the\noverall conception. \n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 59\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nAn excellent starting point is a double-CD set\ncontaining performances of Dusapin\u2019s 7 \u00c9tudes for\npiano (1997\u20132001) and his Piano Concerto \u00c0 quia\n(2002), both featuring the brilliant playing of Ian\nPace, an inspired champion of the composer.\nSurprisingly, the \u00c9tudes are Dusapin\u2019s first large-\nscale foray into writing music for the instrument.\nLasting for just under an hour, they are rigorous\nand self-disciplined, founded upon plain gestures,\ncharacteristically laced with sadness and\nalternating between a sense of melancholic\nresignation and repressed rage at the music\u2019s\ninherent restrictions. The first Etude might almost\nbe a \u2018Fantasia upon one note\u2019: the material rarely\nwanders from repeated fragments like a lone,\nwandering voice. By contrast the Fourth \u00c9tude\nbegins in violent toccata-like spluttering, but is\ngradually stripped down to its own inner\nworkings. \nThe Piano Concerto\u2019s title \u00c0 quia refers to a\nFrench term meaning \u2018nonplussed\u2019; the piece\nexplores themes of non-communication and\nalienation as the two traditional protagonists of\npiano soloist and orchestra fail to connect or\nachieve dialogue. When they play together (and\nthe orchestra is daringly silent for large stretches),\nin what one might call an anti-development\nsection, they repeat each other\u2019s material in a\nfutile attempt to make contact. Despite, or\nperhaps because of this, there are moments of\nreal beauty and poignancy in this highly\nindividual concerto, inspired by contemporary\npolitical events. Superb performances are\ncomplemented by a bonus DVD containing\nextensive footage of rehearsals, interspersed with\nilluminating interviews with Dusapin, as well as\ncomplete performances of \u00c9tudes 1 and 4 by Ian\nPace, which makes this release an essential\npurchase.\nDusapin\u2019s four string quartets form part of a\nconcept he terms the \u2018infinite quartet\u2019, in which\neach new example comments on its predecessor\nand presages the issues tackled by its successor.\nThe First is an extensively revised early work, its\nenigmatic, epigrammatic nature the result of an\nenduring love of Samuel Beckett\u2019s writings. The\nSecond, entitled Time Zones, is a much more\nsubstantial piece in 24 movements (one for each\nplanetary time zone) which questions and\ndeconstructs the inherited idea of the string\nquartet. By contrast, the Third is classically\nproportioned in four movements, while the\nfourth evolves with different voices splintering off\nfrom each other within a compact, eloquent one-\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f60\nlistening to musicians \u2013 responding to their needs\nFor people in the music \nbusiness there is always help \nat hand from the Musicians\nBenevolent Fund\n\u2022Help with stress and \nhealth problems\n\u2022Help and advice with financial \nproblems\n\u2022Help that\u2019s given in strict \nconfidence\n\u2022Help given to outstanding \nyoung musicians \nWe operate throughout \nEngland, Scotland, Wales \nand the whole of Ireland\nIf you or someone you know \nneeds our help, please contact:\nMusicians Benevolent Fund \n16 Ogle Street, London W1W 6JA\nTelephone: 020 7636 4481\nFacsimile: 020 7637 4307\nemail: info@mbf.org.uk\nwebsite: www.mbf.org.uk\nReg.

Fortunately, the Accord and\nNa\u00efve labels have released all four quartets\nbetween them \u2013 the Second and Third in the\nhands of the Arditti String Quartet and the First\nand Fourth by the Danel Quartet: both discs repay\nrepeated listening, as Dusapin typically reinvents\nand challenges the genre with thought-provoking\nresults.\nThree major pieces for mixed choir, Granum\nSinapis, Umbrae Mortis and Dona Eis, find the\ncomposer at his most inwardly contemplative. The\nfirst piece is a spiritual, meditation reminiscent of\nplainchant. Umbrae Mortis is a brief torso of a Mass\nfor the Dead, whose brevity raises more questions\nthan it answers. In Dona eis the choir is\naccompanied by the seven wind instruments (but\nminus the double bass), used by Var\u00e8se in his\nOctandre. Dusapin avails himself of myriad vocal\ndevices, from sounds of breathing, to singing\nthrough a closed mouth, to the spoken voice. The\nNa\u00efve disc containing these three works makes an\nideal introduction to Dusapin\u2019s profoundly\npersonal approach to the human voice.  \nDusapin\u2019s four operas punctuate his output\nlike sounding posts at regular intervals. His three\nearly operas, Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (1989),\nMedeamaterial (1992), and To Be Sung (1994) share\nan exploratory, scientific approach to the form, in\nthe manner of Xenakis, but without the latter\u2019s\noverriding concern for drama. Dusapin\u2019s most\nrecent opera, Perel\u00e0, uomo di fumo, is based on a\nnovel by Aldo Palazzeschi and is sung in Italian. It\nis a variation on the story of Christ \u2013 Perel\u00e0, the\nmysterious \u2018man of smoke\u2019, is initially welcomed\nand adored because of his uniqueness, but\neventually ill-treated, judged and condemned,\nreturning back to his original state. Exploring the\nfull range of operatic registers, the opera is\ndivided into ten highly contrasted \u2018chapters\u2019. The\nlive recording recently released by Na\u00efve has a\ntangible sense of atmosphere and theatre but\noccasionally obscures the fantastic detail in\nDusapin\u2019s intricate instrumental writing. The\nmusical resources employed are huge, involving\npiano, percussion, and onstage organ and wind\nband, making this Dusapin\u2019s largest-scale work to\ndate and something of a summing-up, not only of\nhis operatic output, but also of ten years\u2019 worth of\nconcertante and instrumental works. In the title\nrole, tenor John Graham-Hall brilliantly creates a\ngenuine presence out of the most insubstantial\nand chameleon-like of characters. The well-filled\naccompanying booklet includes an interview\nwith Dusapin, a revealing essay and, invaluably, a\ncomplete libretto. \nNa\u00efve\u2019s dedicated and extensive coverage,\ntouching all forms of Dusapin\u2019s creative output, is\na heartening example of a recording company\nplacing their faith in a contemporary composer.\nThere are some omissions, however, which Na\u00efve\nwill surely address in due course. Trio Rombach\n(1997), one of the most spellbindingly poetic\nchamber pieces of recent years, brought heart-\nwarming depth and humanity to the BMIC\nCutting Edge Tour of 2002, and is perhaps the\nstrongest candidate for future CD release, while\namong his series of \u2018Solos for orchestra\u2019, the first\n(Go, 1992), the fourth (Clam, 1998) and the most\nrecent (Exeo, 2002) all require committing to disc.\nDusapin\u2019s forthcoming opera, The last night (A\nStory of Faustus) has been commissioned by the\nBerliner Staatsoper and is due to be premi\u00e8red in\nJanuary 2006: an artistic highlight that will be\neagerly anticipated. \nPaul Conway\n\u2018Conciertos para el fin del milenio\u2019.

Urtext JBCC 047. \nMusic-lovers who think of Latin-American\n\u2018classical\u2019 music through Revueltas, Ch\u00e1vez,\nGinastera, Villa-Lobos \u2013 or, possibly, Guarnieri\nand Serebrier \u2013 are in for a treat with this\ncollection of premiere-recording cello concertos.\nClearly, a new generation is being recorded by its\nlocal talent, and it is time to prick up our ears.\nMexicans Eugenio Toussaint (b.1954) and Arturo\nM\u00e1rquez (b.1950) have crafted involving, richly-\ncoloured, often outright gorgeous works based\non popular sources: jazz and folk, respectively.\nThe concerto by the Puerto-Rican Roberto Sierra\n(b.1953) is no less absorbing, while made of far\ngrittier musical stuff. All were composed for\nCarlos Prieto, the dedicatee of works by about 70\nother composers, including Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo. A\nstudent of Fournier and Rose, Prieto has\nperformed in the world\u2019s major concert halls and\neven authored a biography (The Adventures of a\nCello) of the Piatti Stradivarius he plays so\nengagingly on this disc.\nToussaint\u2019s Second Cello Concerto (1999)\nshould make anyone who enjoys \u2018light classical\u2019\nfeel right at home. His earliest successes in jazz\nled to work alongside Herb Alpert and, later, as\nPaul Anka\u2019s musical director. When Toussaint\nembarked on this work, Prieto remarked that his\nFirst Cello Concerto had strayed from these\nroots, suggesting that he consider a return. The\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 61\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nresult is this breezy, approachable work showing a\ncomplete synchrony from the start between\nsoloist and orchestra. Launching right into a\nvibrant tune, the expansive backup has the soloist\nsharing the stage with harmonizing forays by the\nflute, oboe, horns, strings and light percussion. In\nthe slow movement, Prieto fills the spotlight with\na nostalgic melody of longing while the winds\nunderline, strings pluck a pulse, but little more.\nThe cello and a clarinet switch into high gear for\nthe conclusion, and in a cadenza Prieto jabs the\nwork\u2019s light frame with rough-edged dissonance,\ninvigorating the proceedings until xylophones,\nbongos and strings drive to the work\u2019s conclusion. \nFully in the swing of the work\u2019s idioms,\nPrieto\u2019s rich, deep tone does the composer proud\neven when required to sing at the topmost end of\nthe cello\u2019s range. The work\u2019s strength lies in the\nlyrical middle, where the cello cries an aching tour\nde force, but, in keeping with its jazz roots, the\nmain challenge, and this ensemble\u2019s remarkable\nachievement, is in expressing a sparkling\nspontaneity beyond the notated text. The\ninfectious Latin flavour evokes Bernstein in\nmambo sleeves, rather than the more abrasive\nP\u00e9rez Prado, yet for all its upbeat charm and\nmusicality, this work rewards repeated hearings.\nThe following work, M\u00e1rquez\u2019s Mirrors in the\nSand concerto (2000), places the soloist front and\ncentre almost throughout, while the orchestra\nseldom strays from firm accompaniment.\nM\u00e1rquez has an assured, extrovert voice, and\nreports folk forms in his blood since he learned\nthe mariachi violin in childhood. A student of\nFederico Ibarra and Morton Subotnick, around\n1990 he began drawing inspiration from Mexican\nfolk music and has gained a following with a\ncelebrated series of seven Danzones.\nThe orchestra\u2019s strident, almost regal canter in\nthis concerto confirms dance forms as a\nMarquesian speciality: its sunny carriage\nresembles a Rodrigo score, while perhaps lacking\nhis genial levity. This thicker rhythmic core\nframes Prieto\u2019s melodic elaborations, and the\nmusic emerges from this lyricism rather than\nfrom harmonic interplays. The expressive soloist\ngets support, emphasis and echo from the\nensemble, ceding only rarely to a single\ninstrument or section but never playing opposite\nthem. Understated scoring again characterizes\nthe slow movement Lluvia en la arena (\u2018Rain in the\nsand\u2019), where the cello plays a song of exquisite\nbrooding that evokes Walton\u2019s concerto. The\nMilonga cadenza triggers a more agitated tempo,\ndriving to a \u2018Right-left Polka\u2019 that propels the\nwork with breathless, Shostakovich-like irony to\nthe blistering finale.\nDespite the enhanced percussion (claves,\nVeracruz tambourine, maracas and a Puerto-\nRican g\u00fciro) this is a traditionally-orchestrated\nwork centering on sturdy but graceful melodies,\nat which M\u00e1rquez clearly excels. Supporting the\ncellist\u2019s virtuosic turn, the Orchestra of the\nAmericas under Carlos Miguel Prieto makes fine\nwork of inhabiting a neo-romantic sound-world\nthat so differs from Toussaint\u2019s more spare,\ncontrapuntal work.\nA yet sharper change in character\ntoward astringency and dissonance sets Roberto\nSierra\u2019s Four Verses Concerto (1999) apart from\nboth previous works, enriching this CD with a far\nmore demanding avant-gardist work. To\nM\u00e1rquez\u2019s celebratory dance or excursion,\nSierra\u2019s concerto strikes the ear as a dark saga.\nWhile neither more nor less Latin in flavour and\nrhythmic core than the previous works, these are\nfar more deeply integrated within Sierra\u2019s voice. \nIn stark contrast with Toussaint\u2019s concerto,\ncellist and orchestra begin by generating separate\nsonic cells, embarking at contrasting tempi from\nnear-opposite ends of the scale. Straying far from\nthe orchestra \u2013 which for once is given considerable\nautonomy \u2013 the cello wanders in pursuit of some\nmusical concretion, to complete a worthy theme,\nor perhaps just content to roam. Its tension with the\norchestra has no parallel on this disc. \nWhile engrossed in its articulations, colourful\nsparks are set off by light percussion and winds,\nclashing against weighty horns, double-basses\nand darker woodwinds. Sierra\u2019s dazzling\norchestral chaos is reminiscent of Thea\nMusgrave\u2019s brand of lucid and nimble disorder,\nand in the second movement it waxes and wanes\nwith the cello\u2019s restlessness, yet never quite\nsettling into accompaniment. A vague\nconvergence does occur in a passage full of\nanticipation that culminates with the cello\u2019s\nsoaring phrase (at 0:22); and when, duetting with\nvarious winds, the soloist entwines with a flute\u2019s\nphrase, and then completes it (at 3:02). But these\nmoments always pass, the ensemble seemingly\nuninterested in the wayward cello. After an edgy\ncadenza, the strain of this aptly-named Intenso\nleads into a movement where the tensions\nslacken: the cello sets a less discordant direction\nfor the straying woodwinds, percussion and\ndisruptive brasses, and amid this more subdued\nbackdrop the soloist takes on the near-\nprominence of a first among equals.\nThe dots so far strewn across the work start\nconnecting in the vigorous Vivo, and in the\njauntier R\u00edtmico movements, overcoming the\nstark initial contrasts while never quite forsaking\nits character as an eerie and uncompromising\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f62\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nmusic. A more recognizably Latin-American\npulse begins supporting the soloist with energetic\njabs and stresses, enhancing calmer moments\nwhile setting a quicker beat for the cello to rush\ntoward an end that, unconventionally as ever,\nseems to arrive too soon \u2013 while curiously\nsuggesting a satisfying resolution. Just prior to\nthis, amid the rapid-fire playing, the work reaches\nthe culmination it seemed at least partly driven\ntowards (at 1:28), its moment of restful merging.\nSierra worked in Hamburg with Ligeti, yet this\nmusic shows as much affinity with Roberto\nGerhard\u2019s for the seeming unruliness and for\nuniqueness: engaging the listener despite its high\nlevel of abstraction and the unbending avoidance\nof clich\u00e9. The likeness extends also to its\ndifficulty: those so intrigued as to listen again may\ndo so not for the ride or to be swept away, but for a\nbetter grasp of its startling wealth of tensions.\nCuatro versos is clearly this disc\u2019s most bracing\nwork, given its unusual ways of generating\nmusical cohesiveness. For all the compositional\nstrengths and musicality of the Toussaint and\nM\u00e1rquez concertos, only Sierra\u2019s rightful kin are\nLutoslawski, Gubaidulina and Dutilleux, placing\nhim firmly in the 21st century.\nThe Orchestra of the Americas under Carlos\nMiguel Prieto (recorded in the Sala Nezahual-\nc\u00f3yotl, Centro Cultural Universitario, Mexico\nCity) adapts seamlessly to the challenging\nrequirements, backing the soloist in the\nneoclassical Toussaint as a kind of rhythm\nsection; joining the cellist\u2019s shaping of M\u00e1rquez\u2019s\nmelodic lines with bold but agile ensemble work;\nand rallying to the astringent Cuatro versos, with\nthe wandering and ambiguities, and its unruly\nscoring. A tall triple order, but very handsomely\nmet. All three composers owe a strong debt to\nPrieto\u2019s advocacy, yet each one repays by giving\nthe Piatti a range of opportunities to display his\ngifts. In a field crowded by fine cellists, when\ninstrumentalists with big contracts so often stay\nwith the \u2018classics\u2019 or drift into pointless crossover,\nPrieto\u2019s discography includes impressive\nconcerto premi\u00e8res by Federico Ibarra, Celso\nGarrido-Lecca, Camargo Guarnieri, and Ireland\u2019s\nJohn Kinsella \u2013 each of which leaves no doubt that\n\u2018classical\u2019 music is very much alive and thriving.\nLovers of contemporary \u2018classical\u2019 will welcome\nConcertos for the End of the Millennium: three\nremarkable, well-recorded works spanning a\nwide musical spectrum. These sparkling\nperformances by the Orchestra of the Americas,\nin the expert hands of both Prietos, deserve the\nhighest possible recommendation. \nBert Bailey\nBRAUN: Psalterion (2000); Day and Day (1998); Piano\nTrio No. IV (2002). Amber Trio Jerusalem, Eli Sassoon\n(santur), Edna Prochnik (mezzo-sop). Gramola 98766.\nThe compositional juggling of local and\ninternational idioms at the heart of much\ncontemporary music is an aesthetic challenge\nthrown particularly into relief in modern Israeli\nmusic, which is concerned above all with a cogent\nbalance of eastern and western elements. The\nissue is potently encapsulated in a recent work,\nPsalterion, by one of the leading composers of the\nsecond generation, Yehezkel Braun (b.1922),\nwhich combines a Persian santur with a western\nEuropean piano trio, and Arabic modes with\nEuropean harmony and forms. Braun is well\nknown for his popular and prolific output of\nchoral music, yet his oeuvre also includes an\nimpressive array of vocal and chamber music as\nshown in a recent CD which features Psalterion,\nalongside a beguiling song cycle to poems by the\npoetess Yocheved Bat-Miriam (1902\u201380), and the\ndramatic fourth Piano Trio, Braun\u2019s most\npassionately complex trio to date. (Three earlier\ntrios feature on a CD by the Amber Trio\nJerusalem on the label of the Beth Hatefutsoth,\nTel-Aviv and Jewish Museum, Vienna CC-005-0.) \nThe title Psalterion alludes to the \u2018psanterin\u2019\nmentioned in the list of instruments in the Book\nof Daniel, a Greek word which refers to a type of\nlyre played with mallets, and which corresponds\nclosely with a modern instrument known as the\nsantur (interestingly the modern Hebrew for\npiano is \u2018Psanter\u2019). Braun\u2019s interest in the\ninstrument stems primarily from the wide\nmusical influences he absorbed in Israel, where he\ncame aged two in 1924 from his native Germany.\nAmongst his teachers was Alexander Uriah\nBoskovich, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 from Romania, who was\nparticularly interested in evoking the sounds of\nthe Middle-East. Braun, now Professor Emeritus\nat Tel-Aviv University, became an authority on\nGregorian Chant. These twin influences, of\nmiddle-eastern melos and medieval plainchant,\ninfuse his melodic-harmonic style alongside with\nthe organum and parallel part-writing idiomatic\nto the French school of the late 19th century.\nWhile his large output frequently explores\ntraditional music, this quartet represents\nsomething of a new departure for as he admits in\nthe sleeve notes, \u2018Oriental and Western music are\nworlds apart, so different\u2026 that it is well nigh\nimpossible to combine them. For me as a\ncomposer this was undoubtedly the most difficult\ntask I have ever tried to tackle\u2019.\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 63\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe melodic material of Psalterion is drawn\ndirectly from an oral tradition \u2013 performances by\nBraun\u2019s friend, the amateur santur player and\nPersian carpet dealer Eli Sassoon (the performer\non this recording) \u2013 which Braun transcribed in\ndetail, then integrated the result with piano trio\n(there is also an orchestral version). Both the first\nand third movements use the Persian \u2018Dashti\u2019\nmode which is the same as the \u2018Maqam Bayat\u2019 or\nbayat mode, one of the most popular and\nimportant modes in Arabic folk music and used\nwidely in Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Iraq. Both\nouter movements also begin with a slow and free\nsolo santur soliloquy which leads into a more\nrhythmic movement for the ensemble. The range\nof sonorities is both refreshing and imaginative:\nrather than westernizing the santur, the result is\nan orientalizing of the piano trio, with much use\nof high-registral cello and doubling melodies for\nstrings, repeated-note textures, ornamentation\nand pedal points. Though there are moments\nwhich retrieve a Western sonority and sense of\ndrama, as in the trio solos, the accent is on the\nimitation of santur by the trio. However the\nformal shape of the work is clearly Western in\norientation, with clearly-defined contrasting\nsections, such as the shift from a slow undulating\nmelody at the start of the central movement to a\nmore waltz-like section, and the extended\ncadenza which launches the final rondo like\nfinale. \nIf there are echoes of minimalism in the\nmodal-tonal harmony and patterning, the main\naesthetic issue arising from the piece concerns the\nintegration of folk elements into art, or rather of\nlocal and international idioms: whether, like\nMaxwell Davies\u2019s use of an Orkney Fiddler in a\nsymphony orchestra perhaps, such combinations\ncreate a self-conscious opposition of elements\nrather than a synthesis? Moreover, does such\nintegration act as a bridge between cultures, or\nrather an appropriation of one idiom by another \u2013\na form of cultural imperialism? The answer here\nemerges from the work itself, which for me\nachieves a compelling symbiosis of disparate\nelements with a clear Eastern flavour, yet\nenhanced through the lucidity of its Western-\ninfluenced form. It is a stylistic balance through\nwhich beautiful sonorities and engaging dialogue\namongst the instruments contribute to a uniquely\ninnovative and enthralling ambience.\nMalcolm Miller\nBIRTWISTLE: The Axe Manual1; Oockooing Bird; Sad\nSong; Berceuse de Jeanne; Pr\u00e9cis; Hector\u2019s Dawn;\nOstinato with Melody; Betty Freeman: Her Tango;\nSaraband: The King\u2019s Farewell; Harrison\u2019s Clocks.\nNicolas Hodges (pno), 1Claire Edwardes (perc).\nMetronome MET CD 1074.\nIn his review of the Collins Classics recording of\nAntiphonies for piano and orchestra,5 the pianist\nNicolas Hodges drew attention to what he felt\nwere numerous weaknesses in the soloist\u2019s\nperformance. At times withering (\u2018the piece\nwould undoubtedly be more colourful in lyrical\nand brutal sections alike if the pianist could find it\nin herself to project Birtwistle\u2019s dynamics,\narticulation and phrase marks\u2019), Hodges\nnevertheless emerges in his prose as a superb\nadvocate of Birtwistle\u2019s music, in which\nintellectual and critical understanding co-exists\nwith a deeply-felt emotional response. These\nlatter qualities have characterized Hodges\u2019s own\nperformances of Birtwistle\u2019s music, including his\n2000 performance of Antiphonies. And, I am\npleased to report, the same is true of his recent\nrecording of Birtwistle\u2019s complete piano music. \nOf the ten works on the disc, four are first\nrecordings, the most important of these being\nThe Axe Manual (2000) for piano and percussion.\nThe colouring of the piano timbre through\nassorted percussion, moving from marimba to\nmetal instruments and back again, contributes to\nthe overall structure. By treating the percussion as\nan extension of the piano, there is a sense that\nonly one meta-instrument is being used: the\n\u2018Manual\u2019 of the title alludes, amongst other\nthings, to the imaginary composite of the\nkeyboards of the piano, marimba and vibraphone\nwithin the work. Birtwistle also intended the\npiece to demonstrate a wide range of rhythmic\ndevices; in this sense, \u2018manual\u2019 also means\n\u2018compendium\u2019. Taken together, one can get a\npretty good idea of what the piece is \u2018about\u2019; that\nis to say, chamber-music like interactions between\npianist and percussionist in which different\n(mechanic) rhythmic strata shift in and out of\nfocus, engaging our attention. Hodges, along\nwith Claire Edwardes on percussion, wonderfully\ncapture the rhythmic and harmonic subtleties\nrequired of them, no more so than in a beautifully\npoised performance of the lyrical middle section:\na hocket between vibraphone and the upper part\nof the piano proving to be especially captivating.\n5 Collins CD 14142, reviewed in Tempo 195, pp. 44\u20135.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f64\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nBirtwistle\u2019s only other large-scale work for\npiano, Harrison\u2019s Clocks, is an even more intense\nexploration of rhythmic layers moving at\ndifferent speeds. Hodges\u2019s virtuosic technique\nappeared to make light work of the first\nmovement (reputedly the hardest of the set), but I\nfound his impressive performance of the\nlengthier (and contrapuntally breathtaking) third\nmovement in a single take to be the most\nrivetting. \nThe other eight works on the disc are\nconsiderably shorter, and on the surface simpler,\nthan The Axe Manual and Harrison\u2019s Clocks,\nbetween which they are sandwiched. Ostinato and\nMelody takes as its basis the characteristic\nBirtwistle device of superimposing a melody over\na constantly-changing ostinato. Another\nBirtwistlian trait is apparent in Betty Freeman: Her\nTango and Saraband: The Kings Farewell, which\nboth imaginatively distort the dances implied in\ntheir titles. The earliest work on the disc, and\nindeed, the earliest extant composition by\nBirtwistle, is Oockooing Bird, written in the\ncomposer\u2019s mid teens. As with the pieces for\nchildren with which it is grouped \u2013 Sad Song\n(1971) and Berceuse de Jeanne (1984) \u2013 the musical\nlanguage is predominantly modal; this, combined\nwith the use of ostinato, and the general\nmelancholic atmosphere is prophetic of\nBirtwistle\u2019s later music. So too is the way in which\nBirtwistle disturbs the formal symmetries of\nPr\u00e9cis (1960) in order to create forward\nmomentum. Hodges\u2019s performance of this is\nnoticeably faster and at times more brittle than\nthose of Stephen Pruslin6 and John Ogdon7: as a\nresult, is his a more urgent and volatile reading,\nbut not without moments of poetry. \nThus these occasional works are no mere\n\u2018fillers\u2019 or curios, but rather miniature studies of\nthe technical and aesthetic ideas that inform\nBirtwistle\u2019s larger works. They therefore shed\ninteresting light on the major works, but this light\nalso reflects back to give the smaller works\nincreased depth. This is aided in the logical\nordering of the works on the disc, not by\nchronology, but by artistic themes and concerns,\nas well as the fascinating discussion between\nBirtwistle, Hodges and Jonathan Cross in the CD\nbooklet. This is a disc for anyone who admires\nBirtwistle\u2019s distinctive music, as well as for those\nwho enjoy challenging but affirmative music\nperformed with consummate musicianship.\nEdward Venn\nDIAMOND: String Quartets (complete); Concerto for\nString Quartet; Night Music for Accordion and String\nQuartet1.

In many\nways the ten String Quartets written between\n1941 and 1968 (11 if one includes the 1936\nConcerto for String Quartet, a spontaneous\nyouthful offering generated by and dedicated to\nAlbert Roussel), mirror the even more massive\ncordillera of Diamond\u2019s symphonies, the last of\nwhich (No. 11) appeared in 1992. Diamond has\nalso written a Concerto for String Quartet and\nOrchestra (1995), a return to the medium after\nnearly three decades. \nTaken in their chronological context the\nquartets mirror his stylistic evolution: the first\nthree date from the 1940s, a period of serene\nmodality and diatonic repose which also\nwitnessed the first four symphonies, Rounds for\nstrings and the Piano Concerto and Piano Sonata\n(both of these still unrecorded, alas). The depth of\nfeeling found in the long Adagio of the Second\nQuartet, an elegy to a female painter who died at\nthe age of 31, points the way to the sudden\ntransition to the much greater intensity of the\nFourth Quartet (1951), written during the early\npart of Diamond\u2019s 15-year residence in Italy. On\nthe surface, the texture seems anxious and\ndisturbed, but the apparent disorder is little more\nthan a mask for the underlying structural\nintegrity and formal discipline. Diamond turns\nagain and again to the variation form (the last\nmovement alone of this epic 40-minute essay\ncomprises ten variations lasting 15 minutes). \n6 Clarinet Classics CC 0019.\n7 EMI ASD 645.\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 65\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nDiamond had met Arnold Schoenberg in the\n1930s in New York and recognised the vast new\npossibilities opened up by his advocacy of the 12-\ntone method. Diamond grasped immediately\nthat this was a technical tool, not an end in itself,\nand thus he has been able to use it to as great or\nless an extent as his creative needs required. Each\nquartet has its own distinctive personality, and no\nless than three are 70th birthday presents to other\ncomposers he admired: Walter Piston (No. 7)\nRoger Sessions, a former teacher (No. 9) and\nDarius Milhaud (No. 6). No 9 (1965\u201368) is one of\nonly two in a single-movement format (the other\nis No. 1) and is a feast of ornaments and trills,\nwhich Diamond says (in an illuminating series of\ninterviews reproduced in the sleeve notes) gave\nhim the chance to bring out the individual\ninstruments by strict dynamic markings. A\nflavour of Sessions\u2019s sometimes elliptical\nlanguage finds its way into the piece. The same\n(dynamic) directions appear in the numerous\nfugues (another favourite format) found in many\nof the quartets, the finale of No. 8 being an\nespecially fine example.\nAs Diamond\u2019s style evolved so it began to\n\u2018revolve\u2019, and some of the raw intensity of the\n1950s (a difficult time for him with much soul-\nsearching) yielded to a less edgy language,\nwithout loss of intensity. Pieces like This Sacred\nGround for choir and orchestra (1962) and Night\nMusic for accordion and string quartet (1961)\nindicate a composer more at ease. Night Music is a\ngem, a brief nocturne in memory of Wallingford\nRiegger, another (still underrated) American\ncomposer Diamond admired, killed in a strange\naccident in New York. The unusual\ninstrumentation is what captivates. The quartets\nfrom the 1960s (six in all) are all mature works,\nand the Tenth (1966), written for a new faculty\nbuilding at the American University in\nWashington, seems an apt summation , ending\nwith brilliant double fugue. Diamond had by then\nreturned to America for good, and embarked\nupon a second career as an academic, holding\nmany important positions at The Manhattan\nSchool of Music and The Juilliard School until he\nfinally retired in 1997. \nThis magnificent set of recordings will bring\nalive a great musical treasure for whoever is\nmoved to investigate it. The members of the\nPotomac Quartet have taken the composer and\nhis music to their hearts. Thanks to these four\nCDs, along with the superb series of orchestral\nworks recorded some years ago by Gerard\nSchwarz and the Seattle Symphony \u2013 now all re-\nissued at budget price on the Naxos American\nMusic Series (with, hopefully, as rumour has it,\nsome further new recordings to be added soon\nfrom that quarter) \u2013 Diamond\u2019s importance and\nstature, not only as a leading figure in America\nbut as a major composer for all time, is assured. .\nDespite the sadness of his passing, at the very end\nof his life his music will now live on to\nencapsulate his lifelong quest for the beauty of\nperfection. \nBret Johnson\nHOWELL: Violin Sonata in F minor; Rosalind for violin\n& piano; Piano Sonata in E minor; Humoresque for\npiano; 5 Studies for piano.

McEwen at the\nRoyal Academy of Music (where she was later a\nFellow and Professor of Harmony, Composition\nand Counterpoint) and established herself as a\ncomposer \u2013 one critic hailed her as the \u2018English\nStrauss\u2019 \u2013 in the years immediately following the\nGreat War. Today her reputation, such as it is\noutside the RAM and the Elgar Society (on whose\nbehalf she for many years tended Elgar\u2019s grave),\nrests on the Phantasy for violin and piano which\nwon her the 1921 Cobbett Prize, her only piece to\nkeep even a finger-nail\u2019s hold in the repertoire\nsince then. It crowns a thoroughly engaging\nprogramme of Howell works for violin and\/or\npiano. As both the longest single span on the disc\nand the strongest work present, the Phantasy\nmakes a fitting climax. In her booklet note, Celia\nPaterson refers to its \u2018soaring melodies and arc-\nlike phrases, flowing rhythmical patterns and\nextensive use of thematic ideas and motifs which\nunify the overall structure\u2019, as good a description\nof the piece as any. At another time, it could have\nbeen titled Sonata and bears consideration as a\nfree-format single-span example of the form.\nHowell did formally compose a Violin Sonata,\nin F minor and three movements, but only in\n1947, after she had faded from view, like so many\nothers whose reputations had been made before\nthe Second World War. Stylistically, Howell\u2019s\nmusic never advanced beyond late Romanticism\nbut she eschewed the opulence of\ncontemporaries like Bax, so that her voice was\nrather restrained. The Sonata is a case in point:\nlacking the drama of the Phantasy it is possessed\nof an enviable poise. I prefer it to either of the\nsaccharine miniatures, Rosalind (1920) and The\nMoorings, though both have a winning salon-like\ncharm and, throughout, McAslan phrases the\nsolo lines beautifully. The E minor Piano Sonata is\nlater still (1955), again in three movements, and\nunashamedly melodic, its heart lying in the\ncentral Ninna-nanna, evocative of a cradle\u2019s\nrocking motion. Howell died childless but had a\nlove of children, so it may not be too fanciful to\nsuppose that the sonata as a whole has something\nof the young in its make-up. Of more weight,\nthough lesser in length, are the Five Studies\nHowell composed when a RAM Professor. These\nare highly accomplished pieces, two or three\nhaving a stature beyond their relatively modest\nproportions, the exuberant final Allegro not least.\nIt matches the nature and virtuosity of the earlier\nHumoresque (1919), one of Howell\u2019s most electric\nsmaller pieces, the demands of which Sophia\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 67\n17 \u2013 27 November 2005\nGuest Artistic Director, Tom Service,\npresents an intriguing programme of over\n50 events at the 28th Huddersfield\nContemporary Music Festival \nFirst Night\nFreiburg Baroque Orchestra perform new\npieces written for them by Rebecca\nSaunders, Michel van der Aa, Juliane Klein,\nBenjamin Schweitzer and Nadir Vassena\nBritish Focus\nIncluding works by Christopher Fox, James\nDillon, Sam Hayden, Michael Finnissy, Chris\nDench and Joe Cutler\nNorwegian Feature\nSeries of 7 concerts featuring BIT:20,\nCikada, Asamisimasa and Nordic Voices;\nworks by Rolf Wallin, Lasse Thorensen and\nEivind Buene\nJapanese Focus\nWorks by Jo Kondo, Misato Mochizuki,\nTakeo Hoshiya and Norio Nakagawa;\nLondon\u2019s Philharmonia Orchestra present\nprogramme by Toshio Hosokawa\nGiacinto Scelsi\n100th anniversary celebration featuring\nthe New London Chamber Choir, Mieko\nKanno and Ensemble Nomad\nInternational Highlights\nNeue Vocalsolisten Stuttgart, Agrare,\nPokrovsky Folk Ensemble, Opus Posth,\nDiotima Quartet, Ensemble Recherche,\nClaire Edwardes, Ives Ensemble\nLast Night\nEnsemble Modern perform a major new\nwork by Helmut Lachennman \nInfo\/brochure: \nT 01484 425082 or www.hcmf.co.uk\nBox Office: T 01484 430528\n(opens 24 September)\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nRahman proves equal to. Dutton\u2019s sound,\nengineered by Tony Faulkner and recorded in the\nHenry Wood Hall, is spacious but intimate. An\nappealing disc, which deserves every success.\nGrazyna Bacewicz (1909\u20131969) is best known\ntoday as a composer of some of Poland\u2019s most\nvibrant music in the mid-20th century, but she\nmade her international reputation in her mid-\ntwenties as a performer when she came third \u2013\nalthough only behind Ginette Neveu and David\nOistrakh \u2013 in the 1935 Wieniawski International\nViolin Competition. She was an accomplished\nenough pianist, as Judith Rosen recounts in the\nbooklet, to premi\u00e8re her own piano concerto.\n(And in the same concert as one of her own violin\nconcertos!) After the Second World War,\nhowever, it was as to composition that she\nincreasingly devoted her time, largely retiring\nfrom public performance in the mid-1950s and\nwinning many composition awards.\nDespite her reputation, her tally of 200-plus\ncompositions, and the renown of the best-known\nof these, the Concerto for strings (1948),\nBacewicz\u2019s discography is modest, recordings\nmostly of Eastern European provenance often on\nspecialist import labels. Joanna Kurkowicz\u2019s and\nGloria Chien\u2019s programme of seven of her better-\nknown works (all bar two are listed as available in\nthe 2005 R.E.D. Classical Catalogue) catches both\nthe steel and sensitivity of her music. In the\nFourth Violin Sonata (1955), Kurkowicz and\nChien are exemplary executants, taking a little\nmore time over the music than previous versions\nand allowing it to breathe. Whilst losing nothing\nof its leanness, they reveal its gravity better than\ndid, for instance, Statkiewicz and Utrecht on\nOlympia (OCD 392). They catch the shades of\nBart\u00f3k and Shostakovich that suffuse all four\nmovements \u2013 just as vital as those of Debussy or\nFranck spotlighted by Rosen \u2013 whilst emphasizing\nthe lyrical qualities of the work, as in the Andante\nma non troppo second movement. \nBacewicz\u2019s Fifth Sonata (1951) \u2013 not otherwise\navailable on disc \u2013 is more compact, playing for\nless than 14 minutes in this bracing account. If\nNo. 4 (here almost 21 minutes) shows Bacewicz as\nmaster of the Classical four-movement sonata\nstructure, in the turbulent Fifth she follows a\nmore severe, tripartite form, the music elusive in\ncharacter although the central Andante dolcissimo\nis lovely. There is, throughout, a good deal of\npower-by-suggestion, especially in the concluding\nAllegro inquietamente. The idiomatic leap from this\nto the Second Sonata for Violin Solo (1958: a work\nwhich the composer came out of retirement to\npremi\u00e8re), is extraordinary. Gone are the folk\ninflections of the earlier pieces, replaced by more\nabstract expression and tonal ambiguity, not least\nin the bold, Adagio opening bars, underscoring the\nseverity of the instrumental line. The reason for\nits more advanced traits lies in the cultural thaw\ninstigated by the Communist regime in Poland,\nwhich permitted composers such as Baird,\nLutosl\u2044awski and Penderecki to create some of\ntheir most characteristic music. For Bacewicz, the\nliberating effect extended to the \u2018how\u2019 of\nperforming technique as much as what notes to\nwrite. Perhaps in the development of the Allegro\nfirst movement proper there is too much reliance\non repeated patterns, though the way Bacewicz\nmodifies and extends the tail sections of these\ncarries more than a hint \u2013 unknowingly, I think \u2013\nof the minimalism that would sweep Western\nmusic seven or eight years later. For all its\napparent abstraction, the tense central Adagio is\nvery evocative, while the squall that comprises the\nconcluding Presto carries something of protest\nabout it. \nWhether Bacewicz had a political agenda will\nprobably never be known, although clues may lie\nin the Partita for violin and piano (the other work\nnot otherwise available on CD) written three\nyears earlier. The marking of the opening\nPreludium \u2013 Grave tells you all you need to know\nabout its character, while the desolate Intermezzo,\nAndantino melancolico, suggests some personal\ninspiration behind the notes. In between comes\nan initially jaunty Toccata, marked Vivace. By the\ntime its three minutes have concluded it seems\nmore than a touch manic, as if infected by the\ntragic demeanour of the movements framing it.\nThe concluding Presto breathes a different, more\nrelaxed air, as if finally free of despair. Kurkowicz,\nably supported by Chien, gets to the heart of\nBacewicz in both the Second Sonata and the\nPartita in ways I have not heard other performers\nachieve. But the programme is not all doubt or\nconflict \u2013 there are three delightful miniatures,\nCapriccio (1946), Oberek No. 1 (a species of fast\nmazurka), and the title track, Polish Capriccio\n(both 1949), all written as virtuoso or encore\npieces and displaying Bacewicz\u2019s lighter, brilliant\nside. An utterly splendid disc, especially given Joel\nGordon\u2019s sensational engineered sound, and I\nhope Chandos delve further into her extensive\ncollection of music.\nThe same label deserves much praise for their\nhistorical disc of the Serbian composer, painter,\nsculptress and author Ljubica Maric (1909\u20132003).\nHer remarkably long life was one of almost\nperpetual political and personal upheaval, from\nthe death of her father when she was just four\nyears old through the horrors of two world wars,\nthe formation and disintegration of Yugoslavia\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f68\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nand the cultural oppression of the communist\nregime. Her music ranged stylistically from folk-\nderived simplicity to microtonal experimentation\n(she was a highly regarded student of Alois H\u00e1ba\nin Prague in the 1930s \u2013 she turned down the\nchance of becoming his assistant \u2013 as well as of\nJosef Suk and Hermann Scherchen) but much of\nher earlier music was lost through the vicissitudes\nof war in central Europe. Chandos\u2019s disc features\nfour works from the post-war period in archival\nrecordings from Serbian Radio and TV dating\nfrom 1964, except that of the large-scale cantata\nSong of Spaces (1956), often cited as her most\nimportant work (and apparently much admired\nby Shostakovich), which is from 1977. The earliest\nwork on offer, Song of Spaces is a remarkable\nchoral-and-orchestral tapestry setting funerary\ninscriptions of the medieval Bogomil sect. This\nChristian offshoot was based geographically in\nBosnia-Herzegovina but theologically in\nManichaeism; on their tombstones they recorded\ntheir heroism and fealty to lord and God with\nimprecations not to disturb their bones. From\nthese Maric wove a work full of vivid drama and\nsymphonic movement and the performance by\nthe Mixed Choir and Symphony Orchestra of\nBelgrade Radio-TV under Mladen Jagus\u02c7t matches\nthe white heat of her music. If the sound quality\nis not first rate it is certainly in no way\nproblematic, with good depth and little distortion\nin the upper registers or louder, fuller passages.\nIt has been suggested that Maric disguised or\nsublimated her pre-war avant-garde idioms in\nmusic ostensibly looking backward into Serbia\u2019s\npast, especially in those works based on Byzantine\nmusic. Her interest, however, strikes me as\ngenuine enough, as can be heard in her other\nmajor large-scale project, the cycle of four works\nbased on the Octo\u00ebchos, a volume of medieval\nSerbian sacred music derived in turn from\nByzantine liturgical modes. Maric used these\nscales and modes as a reservoir in this tetralogy of\nsecular works, three segments of which are\nincluded on Chandos\u2019s disc. The single-span\norchestral Octo\u00efcha I is missing but something of\nits nature can be gleaned from the Byzantine\nConcerto (1959), a three-movement work for\npiano, brass, strings, harp and percussion which\ngrew out of the orchestral role the piano played in\nthe earlier piece. A \u2018homage both to our\nByzantine heritage and our cultural roots\u2019,\naccording to the composer, who alerted listeners\nalso to the use of hexachords in the musical fabric\nand how \u2018two connected transpositions of the\nhexachord generate a total of twelve chromatic\ntones\u2019. However, there is nothing dodecaphonic\nin the static progress of the opening span, Sound\nand Ringing, while the close of the atmospheric,\nlowering second movement, In Darkness and\nGlimmering, was inspired by early Truffaut. Only\nin the finale, Roaring and Glaring, does the music\u2019s\ncharacter depart from its title, despite the best\nefforts of Olga Jovanovic and the Belgrade\nPhilharmonic Orchestra under Oskar Danon.\nThere is some scrappiness of ensemble and\nintonation here indicating that the music was a\ntouch beyond them, but this is a determined and\nnot unmoving account of a powerfully evocative\nscore. \nThe remaining two parts of the cycle are both\nconsiderably shorter, the intense chamber cantata\nThreshold of Dream (1961) and the instrumental\nOstinato super Thema Octo\u00efcha for piano, harp and\nstrings (1963). The cantata sets surrealist poetry\nby Marko Ristic \u2018raising the question of the\nmeaning and dissolution of life and its ultimate\nsense\u2019. Scored for soprano and alto voices (both\nroles being sung here by the same singer,\nDragoslava Nikolic), male narrator \u2013 Jovan\nMilicevic here produces a sound close to that\nwhich Penderecki would require for his St Luke\nPassion a couple of years later \u2013 and chamber\norchestra, Threshold of Dream is much less\nimmediate in effect than either the Byzantine\nConcerto or Song of Spaces. By contrast, Ostinato\nsuper Thema Octo\u00efcha, here performed magically\nby Maric herself with harpist Josip Pikelj and the\nBelgrade Radio-TV Chamber Orchestra under\nOskar Danon, is gripping from first bar to last in\nits opposition of obsessive tranquillity (centred\nmainly on the piano) and agitation (the strings).\nAccording to the composer this \u2018echoes the words\nin the score: \u201cIn moving it stands still \u2013 in standing\nstill it moves\u201d\u2019.\nAlthough long-resident in the United States,\nThea Musgrave is one of Britain\u2019s best-known and\nmost distinguished women composers. Were\nthere any doubt of this the American Bridge\nlabel\u2019s disc of six choral works would soundly\nexpel them. The largest single span is a setting of\nthe opening section of Auden\u2019s \u2018Christmas\nOratorio\u2019 For the Time Being. Auden wrote the\npoem for Britten but neither he, nor any later\ncollaborator (including Henze), set anything\nmore than small sections.8 Musgrave\u2019s cantata,\n8 Auden\u2019s poem, however, has been tackled several times by oth-\ners in North America. The New York-born Martin David Levy\n(b. 1932) set the poem in 1959 apparently Leonard Bernstein\nwas much impressed) and the Canadian Chester Duncan\n(1913\u20132002) created two works derived from it, incidental\nmusic for a 1965 radio broadcast, later expanded into an orato-\nrio. The most recent setting is by John Scott, the choral director\nof Acadia University, Nova Scotia, scored for double choir, cello\nand percussion and premi\u00e8red in Halifax, NS, on January 21 this\nyear.\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 69\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ntitled in full For the Time Being: Advent, dates from\n1986 and extends for over 25 minutes. A rich a\ncappella choral tapestry, its three large spans\neloquently catch the ambiguities and\nuncertainties of Auden\u2019s wartime verse. In the\ncentral span the chorus turn accompanist to a\nnarrator \u2013 here Michael York, with nicely judged\ndelivery avoiding the histrionic \u2013 who declaims,\nwith increasing emotion, the second of the\nsection\u2019s three spans.

This is one of the\nsubtlest settings of Auden I have encountered, on\na par certainly with Britten\u2019s Our Hunting Fathers\nand Henze\u2019s Sicilian Muses and engaging on a\nmuch deeper level than Bernstein\u2019s Age of Anxiety\nSymphony. \nThere are Brittenish resonances in the third\nsegment of Musgrave\u2019s triptych On the\nUnderground (1994), settings of stanzas that over\nthe past 15 years or so have been printed alongside\nadvertisements in London\u2019s famed subterranean\ntransport system. A Medieval Summer is, unlike the\nother two segments, a single span (lasting almost\n12 minutes) built around a passage of Chaucer\nwelcoming summer into which other similar\nestival texts (including Sumer is icumen in, so\nmemorably set by Britten in the Spring Symphony)\nare woven. As a piece of literature it is impressive\nenough, but Musgrave\u2019s setting catches all the\nheat and languor of the season. The previous two\nsets also bear themes, the first On gratitude, love\nand madness \u2013 setting six poets of diverse\nprovenance, including Stevie Smith, Yeats and\nEmily Dickinson \u2013 and the second The Strange and\nthe Exotic, where the anonymous I saw a peacock\nwith a fiery tail and Edwin Morgan\u2019s The Subway\nPiranhas are framed by a couplet of Herrick\u2019s.\nThose unfamiliar with Musgrave\u2019s idiom\nwould do well to start with the cycle Black\nTambourine (1986), a cycle of six poems by Hart\nCrane set for women\u2019s chorus, piano and\npercussion (played ideally by the chorus members\nbut here by Richard Fitz and Rex Benincasa). No\ntwo movements have similar textures \u2013 the third,\nBlack Tambourine, includes a narrator \u2013 with the\naccompaniment varying from piece to piece. As\nMalcolm MacDonald points out in the booklet,\nhere Musgrave utilized a more direct melodism\nthan in other works of hers, though the whole set\nis evocatively harmonized: listen to the glacial\nopening North Labrador or the delightful\nminiature fifth movement, Pastorale. The cycle is a\ntour de force amongst tours de force and sets the\nNew York Virtuoso Singers decidedly on their\nmettle. They rise to the challenges of all the\nworks here, completed by the tiny part-song John\nCook (1963), ably directed by Harold Rosenbaum.\nBridge\u2019s recording is sympathetic and crystal\nclear. While not yielding all its secrets in one or\neven five hearings, the whole is a joy to listen to.\nElena Firsova (b. 1950) is another composer\nbadly served by the record industry, so full marks\nto the Belgian Megadisc label for collecting three\nof her cantatas-cum-song cycles on texts by Osip\nMandelstam. The disc\u2019s title, The Mandelstam\nCantatas, might suggest a complete survey but in\nfact the three works here constitute less than half\nof Firsova\u2019s settings has made of her \u2018favourite\npoet and the one to whom [she] feels closest\u2019.\nMandelstam\u2019s texts and sensibilities can be felt\nthroughout her musical output. \u2018His poetry is\nwritten in precisely the way I would like to write\nmusic\u2019, she has said and these works, which she\nregards as her most important, are eloquent\ntribute to her love and deep communion with his\nwriting. The earliest is Earthly Life (1984), cast in\nfive sections of varying lengths (the most\nsubstantial being the finale, as in all three works\nhere) to texts drawn from Mandelstam\u2019s\ncollections Stone, Miscellaneous Poems and Tristia.\nFirsova\u2019s vocal style \u2013 and not a little of the\naccompaniment \u2013 has its roots ultimately in late\nShostakovich. Firsova\u2019s pared-down textures fit\nthe verse perfectly, from the \u2018tense and hollow\nsound of fruit falling from a tree\u2019 to the \u2018circling\nchoral dance of shadows that trampled the soft\nmeadow\u2019. There is something in the music of that\nstrange acoustical effect when the snow is on the\nground, a dampening of emotion that becomes\nall the more intense for its restraint.\nThat sense of atmosphere recurs to very\ndifferent ends in Forest Walks (1987), by contrast a\ndiptych setting two further poems from Stone.\nHere music of rapt beauty illuminates\nMandelstam\u2019s icy and rather gloomy forest-\nscapes, where loneliness and sorrow are carried\nlike a bird which might be shot on the hunt at any\nmoment. The longer second span acts like a lens\non the matter of the opening Lento (the\nmovements in all the works bear only tempo\nmarkings in lieu of titles). Something similar\noccurs in two stages in the final pair of\nmovements of Before the Thunderstorm (1994),\nalthough this cantata opens with a short\ninstrumental Adagio, which gives way to a series of\nmusical thumb-nail sketches of characters from\nMandelstam\u2019s Moscow Poems. This gives way to\naltogether more apocalyptic visions of Russia\u2019s\npast with a recurrent theme of a son cut off from\nfamily, perhaps mirroring the poet\u2019s own periods\nof internal exile. Here and there come occasional\nflashes of Britten in the textures (listen for\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f70\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ninstance to the horn writing as much as the voice\nin the Maestoso fourth span) and it is not fanciful to\nplace Firsova\u2019s cantatas in the same league as the\nSuffolk master\u2019s Serenade, Nocturne or Phaedra.\nSoprano Ekaterina Kichigina sings on the whole\nbeautifully, sounding a touch shrill in upper\nregisters, and she is accompanied superbly by the\nStudio of New Music Moscow under Igor Dronov.\nThe recordings, made in Moscow in April and\nMay 2002, are first-rate. An excellent disc which I\nurge all lovers of vocal repertoire to try.\nDespite containing pieces entitled Pangu\u2019s Song\nand Three Voices, the music on New World\u2019s disc\ndevoted Kui Dong (b. 1966) is instrumental \u2013 well,\nup to a point: two movements of her electronic\ntape\/computer piece Crossing (1999\u20132000)\nfeature voices (including her own in a song learnt\nin childhood). Like her compatriot Chen Yi, Kui\nDong emigrated to the US from China to further\nher education and qualified from Stanford\nUniversity. Her works have been performed\naround the world and received numerous\nhonours and prizes. Her style is a fusion of\nelements from Chinese traditional and Western\navant-garde music, in range covering ballet, film,\norchestral, instrumental, multi-media and\nelectronic scores. The earliest here is Blue Melody\n(1993), a variation-form quintet for flute, clarinet\nand piano trio. There is no theme as such; rather\neach variation takes the opening paragraph (in\nwhich the instruments only gradually enter) as a\nkind of thematic reservoir to evolve their own\nsubstance. The result sounds like controlled\nimprovisation \u2013 something close to her heart \u2013\nand she has used her own extemporizations as\nspringboards for several works, as in the piano\nsuite Earth, Water, Wood, Metal, Fire (2001). Each\nmovement is a kind of portrait of its element,\nfrom which the ancient Chinese believed the\nworld was constructed. Naturally, the five pieces\nare highly contrasted, Earth strong and solid,\nWater delicate and shimmering (and not unlike\nsome of Takemitsu\u2019s rain pieces), while in Wood\nand Metal the composer requires pencils and\ntriangle beaters (placed between the strings)\nrespectively to provide a slightly \u2018prepared\u2019,\nadditional range of sonorities. The work\u2019s\nstrength is its diversity, much being drawn\ntogether in the blazing finale, Fire, before gently\nreturning to the cycle\u2019s opening by way of close.\nThe duo for flute (doubling on the alto) and\npercussion Pangu\u2019s Song (1998) won the 2001\nISCM composition competition and requires the\nwind player to navigate through a kaleidoscopic\nmosaic of textures across the entire instrumental\nrange. Playing for around nine minutes, it\npossesses a succinctness which the electronic\nsuite Crossing does not attempt to emulate. Here,\nmaximalism is all, centring on a \u2018head-on culture\nclash\u2019 in the central movement, where pounding\nrhythms and industrial sounds morph gradually\ninto a manic rock-type music with electric guitar\nand drums, before a bizarre Chinese-sounding\ncoda. The final span is the most Oriental in\natmosphere, evocative perhaps of the composer\u2019s\nchildhood. The trio Three Voices (1998), however,\nis scored for traditional instruments: er-hu (a\nfiddle), zheng (a species of zither with an almost\nharp like sound) and di or xiao (a bamboo flute).\nThe music, though, is quite original: Kui Dong\nhighlights the very different kinds of sounds these\ninstruments make in what amounts to a mesh of\naccompanied solos, rather than the dialogue of\nconventional Western chamber music. The\nsonorities are enchanting, nonetheless, the\nplaying mesmeric. Indeed, the performances are\nall well focussed and Sara Cahill\u2019s of the piano\nsuite and Tod Brody\u2019s flute in Pangu\u2019s Song are\nbrilliantly virtuosic. New World\u2019s recording is\nnicely balanced throughout and fairly\nhomogeneous, despite the pieces having been set\ndown in three different locations from California\nto New York.\nElena Kats-Chernin (b. 1957) is another\ncomposer from the East who has moved to the\nWest, although in her case from Tashkent in\nUzbekistan to Australia and Europe, between\nwhich two continents she now divides her time.\nShe is, nonetheless, now regarded as one of\nAustralia\u2019s leading composers and has received a\ngood number of commissions in her adopted\nhomeland. She was a recipient of a Peggy\nGlanville-Hicks scholarship in 1997, allowing her\nto spend some time in Britain, during which time\nshe developed further the writing of short,\nrelaxed miniatures, many in the style of ragtimes,\n24 of them being gathered on Signum Classics\u2019\ndisc Ragtime & Blue. Kats-Chernin has found this\ntype of activity something of a therapy when\nwriting large-scale or more serious scores, often\nthrough re-using discarded material from other\nworks. The first such piece, Russian Rag, actually\ndates from the previous year (1996) and was\nspecifically commissioned for a recorded\nanthology of modern rags. A small-orchestral\narrangement was featured on ABC Classics\u2019\nsplendid all-Kats-Chernin CD, Clocks (ABC 456\n468-2) but here is played evocatively by Nicola\nSweeney and Sarah Nicholls. Several later pieces\nderive from discarded ideas from Russian Ra,g\nwhile several others here are arrangements or\ntranscriptions of ideas from stage works. Green\nLeaf Prelude, Eliza\u2019s Aria, Brothers and Mute Princess\nall originated in Kats-Chernin\u2019s award-winning\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 71\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nballet Wild Swans (2002\u20133), about an imaginative\nyoung princess (Eliza) who has eleven boisterous\nbrothers \u2013 at one point she has to knit jumpers for\nthem out of nettles! The wistful Reflections comes\nfrom her theatre piece Mr Barbecue and describes\nthe protagonist\u2019s feelings at seeing himself turn\ninto his father in a mirroir (as he shaves). Both\nNostalgic Piece and Suburban Rag were penned\nprimarily as incidental music (the latter for a\nproduction of Uncle Vanya, no less) while the\nlively Slicked Back Tango \u2013 alternatively known as\nthe Kosky Tango \u2013 was written for a film about the\ntheatre director, Barrie Kosky.\nOther pieces here came about through\nepisodes in the composer\u2019s own life, such as the\ngentle Get Well Rag, written during the illness of\none of her sons, and Revolving Doors (2000)\ncomposed after visiting her publisher in New York\nand an \u2013 obviously not entirely happy \u2013 encounter\nwith several sets of these entrances which\nprompted this light-hearted if uneasy miniature.\nThe bright Sapphire Rag was written expressly for\nKats-Chernin to perform in public, while the\nmost recent \u2013 Cocktail Rag (2004) \u2013 and Birthday\nRag were composed for friends. One of the few\nreally dramatic pieces is Bucharian melody,\nprompted by memories of her mother who was\nonce an optician in Bokhara (Buchara): this is one\nof the few pieces here that betrays the composer\u2019s\nUzbekistani roots. Nicholls and Sweeney (who\nplays in about two-thirds of the pieces) do the\nmusic proud, with just the right mix of lightness\nand gravitas. Nicely recorded (in the Henry Wood\nHall, London, this January) there is much to\ncharm here, but when heard through in a single\nsitting I for one was left with a feeling that greater\nmatters were deliberately being avoided. \nOne such great matter might be a composition\nof a requiem for one\u2019s own father, but I doubt that\neven as mercurial a composer as Kats-Chernin\nwould respond with something as quixotic as A\nMass for Mass Trombones (1994), a nine-movement\nrequiem for solo trombone accompanied by an\n\u2018orchestra\u2019 of \u2013 wait for it \u2013 76 trombones, written\nby Wendy Mae Chambers (b. 1953). Chambers\nhas made a reputation for herself from the\nunconventional, whether as the inventor of the\ncar-horn organ, a performer on the toy piano, or\nas the composer of works for massed forces.\nPrevious examples include Music for\nChoreographed Rowboats (1979) for 24 musicians\nafloat in Central Park, Ten Pianos (1983), and The\nGreat Harp Event (1984) \u2013 involving 30 harpists!\nThen again there is her Symphony of the Universe\n(1989) for horn, 100 timpani, metal percussion,\njazz band, choir and tape, or her \u2018voodoo tone\npoem\u2019 Twelve Squared (122, 1994, issued on New\nWorld 80526-2) for a dozen percussionists. Other\npieces have been written for 30 trumpets and for\n26 marimbas, so clearly Chambers is a composer\nwho does nothing by halves.\nThe use of trombones was suggested,\nunsurprisingly, by Berlioz\u2019s use of them in his\nRequiem, but Chambers\u2019s creation of a trombone\norchestra, divided into 11 choirs, goes far beyond\neven that great experimenter\u2019s wildest\nimaginings. The music, though, is not especially\nrevolutionary: stern, stark at times with an\nawesome grandeur that has its roots in the\nAmerican pioneer tradition (think perhaps of Roy\nHarris at his most grandiose and sombre), though\nshot through with a mild exoticism that reminded\nme of Hovhaness. Chambers even makes use of\nan Armenian chant in the Sanctus as well as the\ngreat medieval plainsong in the Dies Irae.\nAlthough running in this live performance for\nover 70 minutes, the work does not pall or\noutstrip the limitations of the instrumental\ntextures any more than did the gongs in Cecilie\n\u00d8re\u2019s hypnotic opera A.. Thomas Hutchinson\nproves a most eloquent soloist here, and David\nGilbert directs this extraordinary ensemble,\nrecorded in the Cathedral of St John in New York,\nwith great skill. \nGuy Rickards\nRICHARD ALLAIN : \u2018When I\u2019m Gone\u2019 \u2013 choral works\nperformed by Laudibus (Chamber Choir) and National\nYouth Choir of Great Britain, c. Mike Brewer. Delphian\nDCD34026.\nA composer of many parts, encompassing\nliturgical, sacred choral music, music theatre,\nwith some jazz influence, and an aptitude for\nwriting works for children, Richard Allain (born\n1965) has been described as one of the most\ncreative musical voices of his generation. I first\nheard his emotive Salve Regina for eight-part\nunaccompanied chorus in a live performance in St\nAlbans (March 2004), by the local Carillon Choir\nconducted by Simon Johnson, Assistant Master of\nMusic at St Albans Abbey. Composed in 1992 in\nmemory of a friend of the composer who was\nkilled in a car accident aged 22, the piece was first\nbroadcast in 2000 by the BBC Symphony Chorus\n(2000), followed by its Proms debut, sung by the\nNational Youth Choir, of whom Allain became\ncomposer in association in 2003. This work is\nquite outstandingly compelling to the ear, as well\nas repaying closer scrutiny of its carefully-crafted\nstructure. It has just been released on CD on the\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f72\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nDelphian label, with excellent notes by Tarik\nO\u2019Reagan, who extols the virtues of Allain\u2019s\n\u2018unique musical dialect\u2019 and \u2018delicate\njuxtaposition of order and freedom\u2019. Allain\nhimself cites the influence of Arvo Part,\ndescribing Salve Regina as \u2019stripped of needless\ncomplexity and full of the sounds I remember\nfrom the Church I attended as a child\u2019.\nSalve Regina opens almost imperceptibly, rising\nto a great crescendo of intensity of sound, well\nrealized in this premier recording by the National\nYouth Choir, whilst still managing to retain an\nessentially querulous texture amidst excellent\nprojection and sound quality. At the harrowing\nwords \u2018in hac lacrimarum valle\u2019, from the\ntraditional 12th-century monastic text, the choir\nbreaks into supplicatory \u2018whispers\u2019, subtly\ninterlacing the words \u2018tuos misericordes oculos\u2019\nand \u2018nos converte\u2019 repeatedly, above the slow-\nmoving tenors and basses, to mystical effect. As\nAllain explained to me when he attended our\nlocal St Albans live performance: \u2018I remember as a\nchild hearing people saying the rosary in side\nchapels in the church, and the repetition of\nlitanies in alcoves aside,\u2019 and it was this perpetual\noffering-up of whispered prayer which inspired\nhis \u2018whispering\u2019 sequences in the piece. I asked\nhim about the harmonic structure: \u2018The harmony\nis in fact based on jazz voices, so sounds modern\u2019.\nI noted too a distinctly dramatic intensity to this\nwork, particularly the last section, akin to the\nimmediacy of an operatic score or theatre music,\nwhich no doubt reflects his previous work for\nCovent Garden Opera. \nOther works on his latest Delphian CD include\na strikingly exotic piece, At Night I seek the one my\nSpirit loves, based on the biblical \u2018Song of\nSolomon\u2019 and scored for soprano saxaphone\n(played by John Harle),voice and organ; and the\nliturgical Missa Brevis, first commissioned by\nSimon Johnson and St Albans Abbey Girls Choir\nand beautifully delivered here by Laudibus\nChamber choir. I found the 23-minute Improperia\na very valid Good Friday liturgical piece, based on\nChrist\u2019s reproach of His people for driving him to\nHis Passion after all God had done for them \u2013 but\na little too lengthy for inclusion on a mixed genre\nCD. Although impeccably performed,\nencompassing plainchant, polyphony and\ninnovative use of chord-clusters, the seemingly\nendless succession of anticlimaxes in the\nplainchant, even to a seasoned practising Catholic\nlike myself, palled after a while, however\nevocative they may be of tradition; in the context\nof a modern work one expects more progression\non a 21st-century CD. That said, I can thoroughly\nrecommend this disc for excellent sound-quality,\nthe choirs well conducted by Mike Brewer, and\nsome of the most compellingly innovative works\nI\u2019ve reviewed on CD to date. \nJill Barlow\nAD\u00c8S: Piano Quintet1. SCHUBERT: Piano Quintet\nD667, The Trout2. Thomas Ad\u00e8s (pno), 1Arditti Quartet,\n2members of the Belcea Quartet, 2Corin Long (db).\nEMI 7243 5 57664 2 7.\nWith his Piano Quintet, premi\u00e8red at the 2001\nMelbourne Festival, Thomas Ad\u00e8s \u2013 not for the\nfirst time \u2013 courted the mild sort of controversy\nthat has the habit of baffling, if not infuriating,\ncertain sections of the musical community.\nExhibit A in this particular case is Ad\u00e8s\u2019s decision\nto cast the Quintet in sonata form, complete with\na repeat of the exposition and (damningly) the use\nof first- and second-time bars. The conclusion to\nbe drawn, we hear, is that this is music about\nmusic, an exercise in stylistic commentary to be\nfiled alongside equally clever but curiously\nunfulfilling works such as Sonata da Caccia, Ad\u00e8s\u2019s\n1993 tribute to Debussy and Couperin. \nFor those who have not had the opportunity to\ntest this judgement with their own ears, the\nrelease of this recording \u2013 which has sat in the\nEMI vaults for three years \u2013 is most welcome. As\nwith the previous discs of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s music on the\nEMI label, the performance (by the composer\nwith the Arditti quartet) is scintillating: it stands as\na powerful advocate of this remarkable score,\nwith its fiendish rhythmic subtleties. (The\ncompanion piece on the disc, Schubert\u2019s Trout\nQuintet, is performed with similar verve by Ad\u00e8s\nand members of the Belcea Quartet.)\nListening to Ad\u00e8s\u2019s Quintet, it is clear that this\nis not music about music, per se; rather, sonata\nform is used as a vehicle to articulate the\ncomposer\u2019s ingenious, but always expressive,\nmanipulations of time. The opening theme\npresented by solo first violin \u2013 an ascending scalic\nfragment in a chromatically enriched C major \u2013 is\nalmost immediately subject to temporal\ndistortion, being stretched and compressed as the\nphrasing demands. This transforms into\npassagework, under which the piano enters with\nthe same theme, now in B major and in the ratio\n5:4 against the first violin. And so it goes on. By\nfrequently requiring the performers to feel the\npulse in ever-changing and often irregular\nsubdivisions of the crotchet, Ad\u00e8s gives the music\nan elastic, improvisatory feel. Nevertheless,\nrhythmic precision is paramount, for lines\nfrequently converge, articulating certain points of\n\uf763\uf764 \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 73\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\narrival, only to shift out of temporal focus once\nagain. \nAs one might expect, the development serves\nto intensify the temporal processes of the\nexposition, touching on the two logical extremes\nthat these processes imply. At first the individual\nlines reach a state of maximum dislocation, a\nsomewhat raucous \u2013 if unlovely \u2013 climax that\ndramatically fades into a series of chords played in\nrhythmic unison. As with so much of the\nexposition, the actual rhythm of these chords is\nirregular, and though terrifyingly complex on the\npage, the aural effect is one of continual, if gentle,\nebb and flow, rather like breathing. \nTo repeat, in the recapitulation, the localized\nwarping of time that characterized the\nexposition, would seem forced after the\ndevelopment. Thus the floating temporalities of\nthe exposition are re-imagined, positioned within\na lengthy accelerando which sweeps all in its path.\nWhere the exposition is expansive, the\nrecapitulation is compressed: thus, although it\naccounts for less than three minutes of a work\nlasting nearly twenty, the accumulation of energy\nserves to imbue it with a weight and significance\nsufficient to balance the preceding material. The\nuse of sonata form is thus no mere crutch or\naffectation: it is central to the organization of the\nunfolding temporal drama. Ad\u00e8s\u2019s music, at its\nmost vital, forces us to reconsider those musical\nobjects long considered extraneous to\ncontemporary concerns, and in this respect, the\nPiano Quintet is no different.\nEdward Venn\nEli Zion \u2013 from St Petersburg to Jerusalem: Music from\nthe \u2018New Jewish School\u2019. David Geringas (vlc), Jascha\nNemtsov (pno). SWR and H\u00e4nnsler-Classic CD 93.122.\nThis CD is the fifth in a series devoted to the \u2018New\nJewish School\u2019, impressively performed by the\nscholar-pianist Jascha Nemtsov with the\noutstanding Lithuanian cellist David Geringas.\nNemtsov, organiser of a recent conference in\nPotsdam (reviewed in Tempo Vol.58, no.230) and\nauthor of two books on the subject, is an ideal\ncandidate to provide a fascinating window into\nthe group of composers and performers who\nchampioned Jewish music in the first half of the\n20th century. From its roots in St Petersburg in\n1908, the \u2018Society for Jewish Folk Music\u2019 spread to\nMoscow, led there by Joel Engel, \u2018father\u2019 of Israeli\nmusic; thence to Berlin and Vienna, across\nEurope and to Palestine. Through folklore\nresearch, composition, concerts and publications,\nit laid the foundations for Jewish music of later\ngenerations as shown by the works represented\non this CD. Rare items include Joseph Achron\u2019s\nFragment mystique, the fiery Chassidic Dance by\nLazar Saminsky (founder of the American\nComposer\u2019s Guild), and the intense Rhapsodie\n(R\u00e9citatif et Danse Hassidique) by Solomon\nRosowksy, prolific synagogue music composer.\nAll three moved from Russia to Palestine in the\n1920s and 30s before settling in America. \nParticularly fascinating are the works of the\nless familiar Leo Zeitlin (1884-1930), a colleague\nof Achron, and of Sinowi Feldman (1893-1942),\nwho became a composer of Russian military\nmarches. Zeitlin\u2019s luscious, cantorial-style Eli\nZion, which gives the CD its title, was, according\nto the erudite sleeve notes, one of the most\nfrequently played pieces of the \u2018New Jewish\nSchool\u2019 between 1910-1930. It receives here its\nworld premi\u00e8re recording, alongside Feldman\u2019s\nimpassioned Poem and Rosowsky\u2019s Rhapsodie, all\nthree of which seem to have French echoes in\ntheir harmonies. Meanwhile there is a far more\nmodernist orientalized texture to the eloquent\nIsraeli Suite, four contrasing dances by Joachim\nStutschewsky, the notable Russian cellist, who\nwas a member of the Viennese Kolisch Quartet,\nand who settled in Israel. Bloch\u2019s famous\nM\u00e9ditation Hebra\u00efque is also included, somewhat\ncontroversially: though he stands apart from the\nRussian composers he may have been influenced\nby them, Nemtsov argues, in his early Jewish\nworks, before settling in the USA. Musically\nengaging, as well as significant historically, this\nbeautifully performed CD highlights the artistic\npotency of a consciously-conceived Jewish art\nmusic style based on traditional sources; it thus\nmakes an important contribution to our\nappreciation of Jewish and Israeli music as well as\nthe development of national schools in the 20th\ncentury. \nMalcolm Miller \n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f74\n"}
