A three-year longitudinal case study tracked the effects of specialist \nperforming arts college status on two schools. The sites were a mainstream school drawing \npupils from an area of high social deprivation and disadvantage, and a special school \ncWtering for pupils with profound and multiple learning difficulties, which were awarded \njoint performing arts college status. The government's preferred criterion for judging the \nsuccess of specialist schools is improvement in whole-school examination results. The \nauthors argue that this is a crude and inappropriate measure for these case study schools and \nprobably others. Using questionnaires, interviews and documentation they tell an 'inside story' \nof experiences, challenges and achievements, from the perspectives of the schools' mangers, \nstaff and pupils. Alternative 'value-added' features emerged that were positive indicators of \nenrichment and success in both schools. \n \n \n \nIntroduction \nThe authors challenge the political preference for measurement of specialist schools' success \nin England by examination results. They encourage recognition of other ways in which \nresources attached to specialist status can enrich the lives of all involved. A team of \nresearchers was invited by the two schools in the case study to track effects of the first three \nyears of their specialist Performing Arts College Status (PACS) designation from 2000 to \n2003. The three researchers have many years' experience in schools, higher education and in \nteacher education. They also have specialist knowledge of dance in education. The two \nschools involved, one mainstream and one special school for pupils with profound and \nmultiple learning difficulties, became the first in England to receive Joint PAC S, despite the \nschools' diverse missions and their campuses being three miles apart. \n \nThe research tracked the effects of PACS during the three-year period through collection of \nwhole-school data alongside the perceptions of senior managers, staff and pupils. The purpose \nof focusing on perceptions of key stakeholders was to provide empirical evidence of the \nprocess of change encountered in the lives of those most closely affected by PACS. The \nresearch extends the debate on judgements of value beyond that of whole-school quantifiable \nindicators, such as examination results. \n \nWhilst it is true that examination performance has improved generally in specialist schools \n(Yeomans et al., 2000), there is little understanding of why. The authors claim this is due to \nthe increased financial support that follows specialist school status, which has enabled many \nimprovements to be made in resources, new building and increased staffing levels. There is \nno conclusive research evidence that investment in one subject area, for example the \nperforming arts, could or should have any direct bearing on improving pupils' abilities in \nother subjects such as mathematics or English (Harland et al., 2000). Indeed, at the end of the \nthree-year research at the case-study school there was inconclusive evidence of whole-school \nexamination improvement, but was that indicative of failure? The authors suggest not, as they \ntell a deeper, richer inside story of the lessons learned, the achievements gained, the successes \nand challenges encountered in the lives of people in one joint specialist performing arts \ncollege. \n \nTransformation of secondary education in England \nThe specialist secondary schools initiative was introduced as part of a 'raising standards' \ngovernment initiative that started in 1994.1 It has led to one of the most influential changes in \nschool identity, culture and ethos. Currently schools can apply for specialist college status in \none of ten subjects and successful schools receive large amounts of funding in return for \nmeeting targets on school improvement, community involvement and partnership ventures.2 \nThere are 1686 secondary schools that have specialist status with an expectation of 2000 by \n2006 (DfES, 2004). One and a half million pupils are now educated in specialist schools from \nthe age of 11. Successful schools receive a capital grant of \u00a3100,000 with recurrent funding \nfor four years of \u00a3126 per pupil. Progress is reviewed annually against targets set and \napplications for redesignation are required after four years. \n \nGovernment targets, definitions and range of subjects for which specialist college status could \nbe designated have evolved as they became more firmly embedded in the government vision \nfor a secondary (11\u2013.16 years) school system (Yeomans et al., 2000; DfES, 2001). A much \nstronger 'community brief' emerged after the new Labour government took over the scheme in \n1997. Remits expanded to include collective community responsibility to benefit other \nschools, even in budget terms. The 2001 White Paper, Schools Achieving Success (DfES, \n2001, p. 38), suggested specialist schools should be 'spreading excellence, sharing success', \nand this collaborative remit became an increasing part of the process of scrutiny by Ofsted \n(Office for Standards in Education-government body responsible for inspection and \nregulation of schools in England) from 2001. The growing power base of specialist schools \nbecame part of the wider transformation of education: \n \nThis reflected the vision of and for specialist schools, as 'hubs' of 'excellence', the \ncentral reference point of transformed local education networks, the wider \ntransformation of education, and the teaching profession, and the 'raising of standards' \nthroughout education. (Penney et al., 2002, p. 2) \n \nMeasuring success \nDespite   the growing expectations and functions of specialist schools, a review of the \nliterature focusing on specialist schools demonstrates that judgements of value and quality \nremain predominantly based on GCSE examination results, for example in comparing results \nfrom specialist and non-specialist secondary schools (lesson & Taylor, 2000, 2001; Ofsted, \n2001; Schagen et al., 2002). Others have criticised such research, for example Goldstein \n(2001), for relying on school-level rather than pupil-level data. Gorard and Taylor (2001) \ncriticised such approaches, calling for more refinement that would capture some of the \ncomplexities, for example between the subjects or between cohorts, local influences and \nimpact, and differences between school-types: 'simple pronouncements about the relative cost \nbenefits of specialist schools, not based on such analytical complexity, are unlikely to be of \nmuch value (except perhaps politically)' (Penney et al., 2002, p. 379). \n \n \nWhilst Levacic and Jenkins (2004) addressed these 'complexities' with an in-depth analysis of \ngovernment data, the focus remained on quantifiable academic achievement. The latest Ofsted \nreport on specialist schools (Ofsted, 2005), in the section headed `Pupils' Achievement', gives \na comprehensive breakdown of GCSE\/GNVQ results.3 \nPenney, Houlihan and Eley (2002) criticised the narrowness of many commentaries to date on \nthe success of specialist schools: 'There has been a relative absence of research engaging with \nthe full breadth of the expectations surrounding specialist status' (p. 2). That breadth is \nindicated through wide-ranging aims that include: raising standards of achievement across the \ncurriculum; improving teaching and learning; extending enrichment opportunities through \nspecialist subjects, e.g. through links with outside organisations; encouraging increased take-\nup of the specialist subject; collaborating with partner schools in sharing facilities, resources, \ngood practice; and providing high-quality learning opportunities through specialist subjects \nfor people in the wider local community (Ofsted, 2001). Examination results are a crude and \nunproved indicator in the face of such expectations. As Harland et al. (2000) recounted, there \nare many more benefits, and indeed accounts from pupils themselves show arts-based \nlearning that had transferred to other subjects and contexts beyond school. More importantly, \nthe report found that there were many features of arts education that intrinsically enhanced the \nlives of schools and their pupils. These included: enjoyment in learning; increased self-\nesteem; knowledge and skills; social and cultural awareness; creativity and thinking skills; \nenrichment of communication and expressive skills; advances in personal and social \ndevelopment; and institutional effects on the culture of the school and on the local \ncommunity. \n \nQualitative studies of specialist schools have identified features of good practice. For \nexample, on the basis of ten schools, Tooley and Howes (1999) identified 'seven habits of \nhighly successful schools'. These were: focus on school ethos, strong \nleadership and management, focus on students' learning, innovation to promote school goals, \nquality control, organisation and structure in empathy with ethos, parental and community \nlinks. This work was supported by Gillmon (2001) who also identified the importance of \nmonitoring, target-setting and meeting individual pupils' needs, improving literacy skills, \nlonger days, and Saturday and holiday provision. Schagen et al. (2002) also raised the point \nthat similar factors emerged from research into characteristics of effective (non-specialist \nstatus) schools identified by Sammons et al. (1998). So it is problematic to attribute simple \ncausal links to specialist school status. High attainment in subjects seemed to be related to a \nconducive learning environment, high expectations and concentration on teaching (Schagen & \nWeston, 1998). Where these factors co-existed, Ofsted (2001) found success in subjects was \nsimilar in specialist and non-specialist schools. Generally specialist schools are improving in \nterms of examination results, subject opportunities provided, organisation and management \n(Yeomans et al., 2000). But there remain questions about causality, the emphasis on 'extrinsic \nclaims' and relations with developments in nonspecialist schools. Such issues led to the more \n'pupil-centred', insider case-study approach to the ensuing research. \n \nCase study context \nAlthough the case study was of one joint specialist performing arts college, it comprised two \nschools, differentially positioned, most significantly one mainstream and one special school, \nin a large city in central England. Diversity is indicated in Table 1 in terms of, for example, \nnumbers of staff and pupils. Similarity is indicated in terms of ethnicity, gender bias and high \nlevels of social deprivation and disadvantage. In addition, at the outset, the status of the arts in \nboth schools was very different. The special school had an established high reputation for \nwork in the area and the mainstream school had no previous arts identity. \n \nTable 1. A brief comparison of the schools' profiles \nSchool 1 \u2014 special school          School 2 \u2014 mainstream school \n67 special needs pupils \n11 \u2014 19 age range \n9 teaching staff and 19 assistants \n70% boys \n40% Free school meals* \n30% Pakistani\/Bangladeshi origin \n(Largest ethnic group) \n600 mainstream pupils  \n11 \u2014 16 age range \n41 teaching staff and 9 assistants \n75% boys \n46% Free school meals \n30% Pakistani\/Bangladeshi origin \n(Largest ethnic group, also large number of \nAfro-Caribbean pupils) \n*Free school meals are provided for pupils from families in which the family income falls \nbelow a specified low level. The proportion of pupils receiving free school meals in a school \nis frequently used in England as the main indicator of the relative poverty of the community \nserved by the school. \n \nResearch method \nThe overall aim of the research was to track the effects of gaining specialist PACS over the \nfirst three years of designation. To enable both macro and micro effects to be evidenced, five \nsub-questions were negotiated between researchers and head teachers. \nThe questions were addressed through data collections towards the end of each academic \nyear, using methods indicated below: \n1. How did pupils' perceptions of school, learning and the arts change? \nIn the mainstream school questionnaires were distributed to one randomly selected class of 30 \npupils in each of Years 7, 9 and 11 (90 questionnaires per year, administered during lesson \ntime, ensuring 100% return). Five group interviews with four or five randomly selected pupils \nwere conducted in each of Years 7, 9 and 11 (15 interviews per year). \nFor the special school the profound and multiple learning difficulties of the pupils led to \nalternative strategies. Three mini case studies of individuals were conducted each year (nine \nin total) through interviews with parents and class teachers most closely involved with each \nindividual. It was considered that parents would notice behavioural changes and recall \nsignificant comments made by their children. This proved to be the case. Parents were happy \nto discuss their children's progress and reaction to arts activities, in particular those \nundertaken as joint projects with pupils from the mainstream school. With only seven pupils \nin each class, the teachers developed a close understanding of the needs and responses of their \nindividual pupils and were willing to share this knowledge for the purpose of the research. In \naddition, a group interview with eight to ten pupils on the school council, facilitated by the \nhead of school, was conducted each year. \n2. What are the perceptions of senior management staff on the effects of becoming a \nperforming arts college? \nSemi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted annually with the two head teachers and \nthe heads of the respective performing arts departments. \n3. What are the perceptions of arts and non-arts staff in the schools on the effects of becoming \na performing arts college? \nQuestionnaires were distributed annually to 78 staff, including classroom assistants, with an \naverage response rate of 80%. \n4. What evidence is there for a rise in standards from external evaluations? \nGCSE examination results in arts subjects, mathematics, English and science were tracked in \nthe mainstream school. The pupils in the special school did not undertake external \nexaminations. Documents from other external evaluators, for example Ofsted and Arts \nCouncil for England, were reviewed. \n5. What other evidence exists to enable monitoring of effects and outcomes, e.g. \ntransferability of 'value added - related to the gaining of PACS? \nWider documentation was collected including: minutes of meetings, project portfo lios, the \nnine mini case studies of special needs pupils, and observation of events (The same \nquestionnaires and interview structures were used in all cases earl year.) \n \nWhole-school data on examination results and attendance figures were reviewer for any \nindicators of change. Questionnaires were systematically analysed for pattern of consensus, \ncontradiction and change across the three years. Interviews were trap scribed and scrutinised \nfor emergent themes and cross-referenced with other data sources. Field notes from analysis \nof documentation and attendance at events were used to inform the emergent evaluation of the \neffects of gaining PACS. \n \nAnalysis \nMeasuring whole-school trends \nThe research challenge of this particular case study, involving two such different schools \nachieving joint status, is immediately revealed in the different treatment needed for \nquantitative data sources. For example, in the mainstream school attendance figures \nimproved, with unauthorised absence rates halving over the research period, supporting the \nnotion of a more attractive learning environment by 2003 (se Table 2). Such figures cannot be \ntracked in the special school as their intake was highly restricted (around seven a year), and \ndependent on need. Reasons for absence for example for medical reasons or lack of \ntransportation, would be radically different to those of pupils in the mainstream school. \nMeasurement by external public exam nation progress was also not an option for pupils in the \nspecial school. \n \nTable 2. Percentage of student-day absences  \n 1999-2000 2000-2001 2001-2002 2002- \nAuthorised absence 12.9% 10.5% 9.1% 8.8% \nUnauthorised absence 1.8% 1.8% 1.7% 0.9% \nTotal absences 14.7% 12.3% 10.8% 9.7% \n \nThe GCSE results of the mainstream school in the arts subjects, mathematic English and \nscience are shown in Table 3 for the three years prior to gaining specials status and for the \nfirst three years as a specialist college.

What does this mean? Should it signify \nfailure and jeopardise redesignation as a specialist college? The authors believe the voices of \nsenior managers, staff and pupils offer a more meaningful account of the effects of gaining \nPACS on the schools involved and a more accurate representation of the challenges, \nopportunities and successes experienced. \n \nThe 'inside story' \nThe successes and challenges of the early years of joint PACS are shared through the \nexperiences and perceptions of the senior managers (head teachers and heads of performing \narts departments), the staff, and the pupils and their parents. \n1. Perceptions of senior managers \nThe development of successful joint PACS required constant commitment, leadership, vision, \nperseverance, creative problem-solving, critical reflection and imagination from senior \nmanagers, who were the two head teachers and heads of performing arts. The outcome was \nthe achievement of a firm specialist school identity amongst staff, students, parents and the \nwider community. After three years there was an ethos of pride in that success but without \ncomplacency. \n \nPersonal reflections from senior managers at the end of the research sum up the passion for \nthe arts common to all those who steered the first three years of joint PACS. The process had \nbeen long and required stability of leadership and sustained effort from the fund-raising, bid-\nwriting stages that went before, through the implementation of plans on different sites and \nstriving towards co-location at the end of this research in 2003. The statements came in \nresponse to the question 'What have you valued most in the process of establishing the PACS \nover the last three years?' \n \nIt has been an extension of my own core beliefs about education and the arts as an \nintegral part of the process of connecting people. I have always had a commitment to the \narts and for what the arts can offer children. (HTS2)4 \n \nSeeing young people develop and become confident, people you would never have \nthought capable\u2014producing the most amazing performances, group work and peer \nsupport. Those are the real values. (HPAS1) \n \nGiven the energy required to make this project work in the early years of specialist school \nstatus, perhaps it is not surprising that both head teachers took early retirement in 2004 as the \ntime for lengthy application for redesignation approached. \nThe management of underpinning systems, such as finance, improved, and early mistakes in \ncancelling senior management meetings because of other pressures were rectified. Such \nmeetings were prioritised to ensure communication and shared direction was maintained to \n'steer' developments. Early overwhelming enthusiasm and opportunity led to some \ndistractions from targets and key focus areas. The joint management meetings proved vital to \nimproving success. \n \nCurriculum timetabling for performing arts ventures and overburdened staff was problematic \nthroughout. Coping with the negativity of colleagues, if pupils were extracted from lessons \nfor special events or productions, demanded constant attention. This was exacerbated by the \ncross-site travelling demands in any shared enterprise. The heads of performing arts were \nmost affected as they were the front-lint targets for colleagues' complaints: \n \nWe (arts staff) have almost become a peg for people to hang their frustrations on, \nwhether its an arts problem or not. (HPAS1) \n \nAlthough blocking time for performing arts work did succeed, much energy necessarily \noverlapped into after-school, weekend and holiday time to minimise the impact of other \ncolleagues and subjects, as well as extending opportunities for some pupils. \nThe tension of managing the extras that came with specialist school state increased over the \nthree years as wider reputations, community demands, new move and incentives such as \nCreative Partnerships brought more demands on the same heavily overworked staff.5 Job \ndescriptions and expectations were in danger c becoming impossibly demanding and needed \nrationalising to ensure staff stability Indeed, there were times when the extra demands were in \ndanger of obscuring attention to curriculum innovation and development within each school: \n \nIt's all on top of the day job. (HPAS2) \n \nAlongside the personal achievements and success experienced by the senior managers, \npersonal costs need to be recognised: \nMy job is too big I think. I can't be head of dance, performing arts, be in charge of the \nnew bid, teach a full timetable, run all the GCSE dance on my own, run the clubs and do \nthe community work. (HPAS1) \nContinuity of staffing was an issue. In the mainstream school there were gains and \nses when the head of performing arts was promoted to senior management. There mras \ninstability in arts staffing as drama, dance and music staff changed. Momentum was lost and \nimportant development time taken out of the following year, as welle-stablished relationships \nand working patterns had to be renewed. The damage to continuity and progress was \nrecognised by colleagues: \n \nIt's like starting again, we have learned how to work together, we were thinking the \nsame way which saves so much time and now you have to start all over again to build \nthat relationship, to find out about each other and ways in which you can collaborate. \n,HPAS2) \n \nLessons about planning for future continuity were learned quickly. \nAnother tension for some senior colleagues was perceived inequality in the growth of PACS. \nThe mainstream school appeared to gain significantly more than the special school, not only \nin the inevitable imbalance in facility development because of the proposed relocation of the \nspecial school to share a campus with the mainstream i-zhool in 2003, but also in terms of \n'public consciousness'. Efforts were made to re- \ndress the publicity and presentation of PACS to the 'outside world' but elements c-fJointness' \nremained problematic: \n \nJointness'\u2014there is a lot of work to do there. It has been unwieldy, particularly with \nthe distance between the schools. Such a lot has to go into 'jointness'\u2014that's what we \nare looking forward to in our next move. (HTS2) \n \nHead teachers were aware of different interpretations of the meaning of 'joint status', resulting \nin different expectations. For staff in the schools it was important to develop -iointness' in a \nway that celebrated and pushed boundaries of distinctiveness as well as seeking ways of \nworking together. One area of high expectation from both inside and outside the school was \nimproving inclusion. This proved one of the greatest successes through the cross-school in-\nservice training and production work that focused on sharing ideas and best practice in the \nfield: \n \nI now have a better understanding of 'inclusion' and my teaching has benefited from \nbetter differentiation. (NASSI) \n \nThe special school] has an excellent reputation for teaching. They are a successful \nschool with a united staff. It can only be of benefit to us to work with them. (HPAS1) \n \nOne example was a linked project for the schools. This involved teachers, pupils, rusts from a \nlocal professional ballet company and a television-sponsored live video link for the shared \nperformance with a dance in the community project in Atlanta, USA. The event was not only \na technological first for the city but a process and product of quality in the area of inclusive \npractice. It would not have been dreamt of before the vision that PACS brought. Speaking \nafterwards, both head teachers were amazed at what had been achieved in the same event by \nso many students, of all ages and abilities, from such diverse backgrounds, and across the \nworld. \n \nThe standard of work was so high ... no-one was looking for who was from which \nschool, it was a truly integrated project which has exceeded all expectations. (HTS1) \n \n2. Perceptions of staff \nEarly resistance to PACS was most noticeable in the mainstream school. Some staff were \nconcerned about the whole-school commitment to an arts identity that would inevitably \nimpact on their own subject. Despite offers to become engaged in various ways, there was a \nfeeling of being distanced from developments. Staff saw 'imbalance' in curriculum attention \nand lack of communication as indicated in this quotation: \n \nWe are now a two-part school\u2014those who have and those who struggle on regardless. \nPerforming arts seem to be able to do whatever they want such as taking students \naway from timetabled lessons for arts activities. (NASS1) \n \nOver the three years there was a very considerable diminution in staff resistance as the school \nbuilt its new identity. Some staff left, others were appointed. Opportunities were taken to \nenhance learning by linking arts to other subjects as a way of sharing the benefits of resources \nin performing arts more widely. For example, a humanities project named 'Brazil' used the \narts and associated funding to enhance student learning in new ways. Other colleagues took \non roles with arts enterprises such as helping in performance. Wider engagement in arts \nactivities led to a more supportive whole-school ethos: \n \nEmbedding an ethos also means engagement and involvement of the wider school \ncommunity. A large number of staff have volunteered to become involved in the school \nproduction. (ASS 1) \n \nPerforming arts staff give updates of information, visitors and performances within the \ncollege. It does not feel an outside department. (NASS I) \n \nStaff became increasingly aware of the benefits to the reputation and standing of the school in \nthe local and wider community as a consequence of the quality of the performing arts work \ndemonstrated by pupils inside and outside the school environment: \n \nThere have been some superb school productions, which have raised the profile of the \nschool. (NASS 1) \n \n[PACs] has provided a focal point for excellence and it has lent itself well to an \ninclusive approach where all have an opportunity to excel. (NASS1) \n \nIn the special school the staff were already convinced of the value of the arts in the education \nof their pupils and continued to build on the excellent reputation gained for arts work in the \ncity prior to 2000. There was total commitment to PACS. The whole issue of communication \nand negotiation was easier because staff numbers and school size were much smaller than in \nthe mainstream school. Gains were made in further developing expertise for staff and \nopportunities for pupils. \n \nThe arts permeated the school in new ways. Arts practices led to extending oppor:unities for \ncreativity, originality, the continual pushing of boundaries across the z-arriculum and the \naddressing of national issues such as assessment and qualifications for young people with \nspecial needs. \n \nAnother area of progress across the three-year research was seen in the area of evidencing \n'value added'. The employment of information and communications technology (ICT), made a \ndifference to the quality of the collated evidence. Ideas were shared and developed across the \nschools. CD-ROM and PowerPoint presentations were made and a survey of the material \ngathered highlighted and confirmed the richness and diversity of the performing arts \nexperiences that pupils at both schools received, as well as the depth of learning that occurred. \nThe schools began to move beyond the preservation of material for posterity to exploiting its \nusage. The provision of evidence for individual profiling, tracking and monitoring of success \nwas an attempt to capture the essence of achievement at all levels in and through the arts. \n \nA further major achievement, highly profiled in the special school, was in the skilling of non-\narts colleagues in the arts. The smaller environment, different pupil\/adult ratios and cross-\ncurricular organisation all contributed to enabling this. Consequently, levels of competence \nand confidence amongst staff in the arts increased and they were able to exceed boundaries \nthat would not have been possible without the resources and opportunities that came with \nPACS. \n \nWith all the new ideas and different ways of working I feel much more confident in \nmy teaching. (NASS2) \n \nThe biggest problems for arts staff were unexpected. As specialist staff, engaged fully with \ntheir 'new roles' in a joint performing arts college, the expectations of others 7ose. The arts \nspecialists received constant requests to act as advisors, as consultants and ambassadors for \nthe arts, as co-authors in national texts and as leaders of complex multi-agency projects. They \nwere becoming a new breed of professionals and they could not find training to match their \nneeds. Finding their own ways to break new ground was the only option: \n \nTraining is difficult for us. You can't find good training easily when you're leading in \nthe field ... feedback (from courses attended) is often 'we were there a few years ago' \nin-house and joint training is working. (HPAS2) \n \nThe pressures increased each year as horizons broadened. Managing growing partnerships \nand networks demanded more and more time from the specialist performing arts staff. \nHowever, the rewards of the staff were high in terms of funding availability, support for \nextending their subjects, growing pupil involvement and success in arts activities. As the \nquality of the pupils' work became more widely recognised, appreciation for the efforts and \ncontribution of staff followed. This was itself highly motivating, as suggested in the following \ncomment by an arts staff colleague: \n \nNothing is more motivating than success. At the close of a marvellous production \nwhen parents, staff and pupils voice their appreciation you find yourself saying 'bring \non the next one' before realising what that means in terms of extra work and \ncommitment. (ASS 1) \n \n \nThe arts staff became particularly skilled at working with artists in education. New money \nthat came with specialist status and encouragement though projects like Creative Partnerships \nensured links with increasing numbers of professional artists: \n \nSomehow we have to strike a balance between flooding the kids with too much so \nthere's no sense of privilege and getting them to recognise what a golden opportunity it \nis for them. (ASS2) \n \nOne of the challenges of such opportunities was embedding projects into pupils' learning and \ncurriculum planning so they were not just seen as `fun' one-off adventures. The roll-on \nimplication was the need for teachers to engage with artists at a deeper level to ensure they \nunderstood how each project needed to match the longer-term needs of the pupils and the \nschool. The special school was already ahead of most schools on the interface of artists and \nteachers. Specialist school status brought many more opportunities to continue refining this \npractice and to spread the skills more widely: \n \nWe have staff this year\u2014very confident with the artists and able to negotiate a \npackage and help define outcomes ... Years ago an artist or group could come in and \nwe'd think they know best. We no longer think they know best but we \nwholeheartedly applaud, admire and crave their talent. But we enter into that with a \ndifferent attitude\u2014what is important is the outcome for the kids so ... 'can we talk to \nyou about the kids and our aspirations for the project?' As we become better at being \npartners in the enterprise we become stronger critics as well, it's evaluation for the \nright motives\u2014to grow\u2014this really worked for us because it's seeing yourself as a \npartner as opposed to a recipient\u2014that is the difference. (HPAS2) \n \nDuring the three-year research period, not only were the teachers negotiating individual \nlearning outcomes for pupils with artists prior to projects, but also requiring whole-day \nevaluations with the artists to follow up and develop the work created. The networking \nrequired of staff in specialist colleges enabled these skills to reach more teachers and artists as \nschool\/professional links became a mainstay for the schools: \n \nI have learned such a lot from working alongside visiting artists. (NASS2) \n \n3. Perceptions of pupils and parents \nPupil enrichment, and increases in self-esteem and confidence in and through the arts, both \nwithin and beyond the curriculum, were evident in the range of questionnaires, interviews, \ncase studies and observations pursued between 2000 and 2003: \n \nIt helps you believe in yourself. (PSI) \nIt helps you get up and talk. (PS2) \nIt energises you for other lessons. (PSI) \nThe teachers trust you to use the practice rooms\u2014it's a privilege. (PS 1) We help \nthose from [the mainstream school] to get it right. (PS2) Drama helps you with \neveryday situations. (PS2) \nYou can share things and be proud. (PSI) \n \n \nSuccess of PACS was perceived in different ways by the pupils. For the younger pupils \n'having fun' and 'enjoying their work' (Year 7 PS 1) was important both in and outaside the \ncurriculum along with 'rising to the challenges' set by the arts: \n \nIt's hard but it's good. (Year 7 PSI) \n \nOlder pupils were able to measure the success of specialist status through a perceived rise in \nstandards in the arts (especially in performance work) and through what they saw as an \nimproved reputation and image of their school. \n \nIt makes it a special school. (Year 9 PSI) \nIt makes it different\u2014it stands out. (Year 11 PS 1) \nOur new uniform is really cool. We designed it ourselves. (Year 9 PS 1) \n \nBy the end of Year 9, pupils were much more articulate about the benefits of being in a \nperforming arts college and about things that made learning in the arts fun. These included: \n'greater challenges' and 'more risk taking' in their lessons, 'more opportunities to perform', \n'trips out of school', 'more work with artists' and 'more variety of clubs'. Year 9 pupils (School \n1) articulated awareness of reactions in the local community: \n \nThe community takes more notice of [the school] now. The community can see we have \ntalent. \nOther arts groups from outside school can use our facilities now. Some of the groups are \nreally good. \n \nClub, weekend and holiday projects expanded in both schools and gradually some pubs and \ninclusive projects were set up to pursue the element of Jointness' in new ways. These involved \na small number of pupils and it was clear that the link between e mainstream and special \nschools, on geographically separated campuses, had not \npermeated the consciousness of all pupils: \n \nThose [pupils] who have worked with [the special school] children have got really \ninvolved. Some have volunteered to be mentors and are doing an amazing job. Unfortu-\nnately not enough value the experience. (ASS 1) \n \nIt's a pity that more of our students have not taken the opportunity to take part in joint \nevents. Those that do, clearly gain in maturity and a sense of responsibility. Perhaps \nmore N-611 benefit when we occupy the same campus. (HPAS I) \n \nPupils in both schools and parents interviewed in the special school pupil case studies, \nbecame more articulate about learning processes and outcomes in the arts. Comments \nsuch as 'increased concentration', 'focus', 'team work', being empowered', 'greater involvement \nin creative and original processes' demonstrated this. Many accolades were related to the \nsheer pleasure and enjoyment of participation in arts-based learning. Recognition of the \nimportance of transferable skills from engagement with the arts was more highly valued by \nthe pupils and parents at the special school. This could be attributed to the longer commitment \nto a central place for the arts in the school. Some of the children with special needs did \nmention joint projects and their parents were aware of these and of their value. Typical \ncomments made by parents when interviewed were: \n \nDavid often talks about his friend [mentor]. I think he takes more notice of him than us. \nSince he was in the last production he has joined the club. His concentration has \nimproved enormously and he isn't so 'babyish'. (PPS2) \n \nThe identification of subject-specific skills became more evident in the final year of the \nresearch. Pupils from both schools readily identified the affective nature of dance, drama and \nmusic and associated this with the sense of enjoyment, excitement and emotional \ninvolvement. Getting a 'real buzz' (Year 9 pupil) from a dance or drama class remained one of \nthe top reasons for enjoyment. Pupils were able to articulate what gave them pleasure in arts \nlessons, such as listening to and composing music, the physical nature of dance and role-play \nin drama. The ethos of arts practice in both schools was to engage pupils in as much of the \ncreative process as possible, from start to finish, rather than picking 'off-the-shelf projects. \nThis meant a variety of experiences, from writing scripts and music to designing sets, in \naddition to the skills of performance. In 2003 students in the mainstream school produced a \nshow with minimal guidance from staff. The students conceived the idea, wrote the script, \ncomposed the music and organised rehearsals. The show was a great success and the level of \npride and sense of achievement evident when they spoke about it was almost tangible: \n \nWe were trusted to be so professional, to create the whole project from beginning to \nend, the teachers were there if we needed them and to encourage and support our ideas. \nWe learned so much and now know we could do it all again. The audience really liked \nour work, which made it all worthwhile. (PS 1) \n \nThe pupils valued the breadth of skills and vision this gave them and the responsibility it \nbestowed. \n \nThe power of performance must not be underestimated. Performing raised levels of \nmotivation and standards of achievement. The request from pupils for more opportunities to \nperform was registered early on in the reporting cycle. By 2003 the range of performance \nopportunities available had contributed to a rise in the pupils' confidence and skill levels. In \nthe mainstream school regular performances became an integral part of the life of the school. \nAt the end of each term the whole school gathered for an afternoon during which groups \nshared their work. The level of appreciation and support was high and from the start the \nvisibility of student achievement impressed fellow students and staff alike. There were also \nfrequent performances given at school assemblies: \n \nSharing performance work has become a warm, supportive occasion. (ASS 1) \n \nI do consider it to be significant\u2014it's all about school ethos. I am even getting positive \nreactions from those staff who, in the past, have never offered warm comment ... such \n(events) are significant in changing staff perceptions. (HPASI) \n \nMany of the responses in interviews and questionnaires indicated that being involved in \nperformance, both in school and outside, was one of the keys to improved feelings of self-\nworth: \n \nIt's good to go to other schools and show what we can do. (Year 9PS1) \n \nOur last show was great. We had to do an extra night because so many people wanted to \nsee it. (Year 9 PSI) \n \nPerformances outside school increased in number as reputations grew more widespread. For \nexample, pupils and staff were invited to participate in an international arts festival in \nGermany. A large group of students from the mainstream school appeared for several weeks \nas performers on a weekly children's television programme. These and other events were \nimportant in raising the profile of the schools with the parents and the local and international \ncommunities. \n \nConclusions \nIf we were to use the government's preferred measure of success, a rise in achievement levels \nin GCSE\/GNVQ examinations, then results for the mainstream school would be inconclusive. \nThere were an increased number of pupils taking GCSEs, and additional opportunities in the \narts, but no trends of increased success emerged. The examination was never appropriate or \nrelevant for the students with severe learning difficulties in the special school. The systematic \ncollection of data, using a multi-method approach over three years, enabled a richer picture of \nsuccesses, challenges and changes to emerge. The 'inside story' will be of interest to other \nschools, their managers, teachers and pupils, as the specialist school model transforms \nsecondary education in England. \n \nBoth the mainstream and special schools adopted the mantle of specialist status with energy \nand commitment, realising many of the wider expectations of such institutions (Ofsted, 2001; \nPenney et al., 2002). The intrinsic qualities of the arts in education identified by Harland et al. \n(2000) were all evidenced in the research. The range and diversity of opportunities in the \nperforming arts available to all pupils increased enormously. The benefits for pupils in terms \nof self-esteem, enrichment, cultural awareness and enjoyment of the arts were made possible \nthrough opportunities brought about by specialist college status such as increased facilities \nand revenue funding, raised expectations of networking, community engagement and linking \nwith the professional arts world. Joint productions and events benefited both mainstream and \nspecial school students and staff and made inclusion a two-way process and one of the major \nsuccesses. After three years the benefits were visible in the schools' ambience, vibrancy and \nwall displays, the improvement of facilities, additional resources, staffing and established \nidentity that was shared between staff, pupils, parents and community. The Artsmark Gold \nAward was achieved, for good practice.6 Positive responses about arts practices came from \nother external sources of scrutiny, such as Ofsted. The performing arts provided a particularly \nvisible route to establishing, reinforcing and consolidating the new identity with well-\npublicised and attended events through which developing skills, confidence and competence \nwere regularly displayed. Other government initiatives, such as 'Gifted and Talented' and \n'Creative Partnerships' to enhance arts education, creativity and the potential of children, were \nimaginatively integrated into specialist college planning, maximising the provision of \nadditional government funding.7 For example, the government-funded 'Creative Partnerships' \ninitiative impacted on the case-study schools at an opportune moment as they moved into \ntheir third year of specialist status knowing they had to improve 'community targets' by \nnetworking with more local schools. The scheme was piloted in the city, the project requiring \nclusters of local schools to work collaboratively. The specialist schools system provided a \nready-made network of partner community schools. The overlaying of additional government \nfinance was used to expand and enhance the school's PACS and community role, satisfying \ngovernment targets on both fronts. \n \nThe special school had established an outstanding reputation for arts practice in the city \nbefore gaining specialist school status in 2000. The new venture enabled staff and pupils to \nfurther their endeavour to place the arts at the centre of the curriculum, to pursue cutting-edge \nwork on identifying progress at every level of the achievement scale and to provide \nopportunities, awards and qualifications which were appropriate to their pupils. They also \ngave generously of their newly acquired knowledge and expertise. joint in-service training \nenabled staff from the mainstream and wider community of schools, as well as local artists, to \nimprove their knowledge of working with pupils with special needs. The school was able to \ncascade expertise through new networks and the reciprocity led to many interesting inclusive \nprojects and increasingly productive learning and teaching exchanges. \n \nThe changes in the mainstream school were most visible as they adopted a new identity and \npushed through early stages of resistance to realise a whole-school commitment to PACS. \nBecause the special school was to co-locate on their campus in December 2003, much of the \nfacilities investment that came with specialist school status went into the mainstream site. It \nwas unfortunate then, that within a year of co-locating, as their redesignation bid began in \n2004, the government decided not to recognise joint specialist colleges any longer, despite a \njoint deputation from the case-study schools to the DfES. This was symptomatic of \ngovernment short-term policies and ironic after three difficult years when these schools were \non the brink of realising their aspirations for further co-ordinated development on a shared \nsite. Perhaps part of the problems relating to joint status lay in different interpretations of \nmeaning. Some outsiders interpreted 'joint' as 'merger', whilst both schools wanted to retain \ntheir separate identity even after co-location, to 'maximise collaboration but respect and \ncelebrate difference' (HTS2). \n \nThe other major tensions were around the pressures felt by the arts staff as the schools \nassumed the status of a performing arts college. With no additional training their roles \nwidened considerably. As Penney, Houlihan and Eley (2002) identified, the policy shift was \ntowards making specialist schools 'hubs' to work with local schools and agencies, to enter into \ninitial and continuing teacher training, to adopt the 'school improvement' roles and \nresponsibilities from positions of leadership. The schools were not selected in the first place \nbecause of their outstanding potential in this direction. Consequently, staff found themselves \nimmediately cast as 'experts'. They learnt by experience and managed these new roles as \neffectively as possible but there was no preparation or training that met their needs for such a \ntransition and this was a constant source of criticism from them. Shifting goal posts was \nunhelpful. The increased expectations for their community role, and management of growing \nnetworks, made excessive demands on the head teachers and arts staff. These were \nproblematic throughout the first three years. \n \nMuch of the drive and success of the joint PACS was attributable to the vision, commitment, \nperseverance and stability of the senior managers, head teachers and heads of performing arts \ndepartments. Achievements need to be celebrated but costs recognised. In many senses senior \nmanagers were victims of their own success, a success that constantly spiralled upward \nrequiring creative, problem-solving management skills. The major beneficiaries have been the \nchildren, with exciting adventures in the arts, which were undreamed of before funding and \nnetworking made them possible. The staff, because of the efforts demanded, have also \ndeveloped and grown in ways that were unforeseen in 2000. The habits of successful schools \n(Tooley & Howes, 1999) were evidenced in the case-study schools, in particular the manage-\nment focus on school ethos. Factors such as managing longer days and holiday provision \nmirrored research of Gillmon (2001) . However, because of the case-study nature of this \nresearch there remain unanswered questions such as the similarities and differences that may \nor may not exist between specialist schools and good non-specialist schools. The evidence of \ndifference attainable from the financial incentives and rewards that came with specialist \nschool status remains tangible and undeniable. The successes experienced here are amplified \nin the gender and ethnicity debate when revisiting the predominantly male, Muslim context of \nthe pupil population. That a GCSE in dance was introduced at all is worthy of celebration, \ngiven the complexity of issues surrounding gender, ethnicity, religion and the performing arts \n(Benn, 2005). \n \nProfessional challenges and future research \nThe 'inside story' recounted here highlights professional challenges to meet the unforeseen \noutcomes of the transformation of schooling led by the specialist schools model. Future \nresearch needs to address concerns arising from this research, many of which mirror those \nemerging from Penney, Houlihan and Eley's (2002) first national survey of specialist sports \ncolleges: \n\u2022 Staffing demands can be onerous and a new type of professional is emerging, for \nexample much time and energy is required to sustain and develop partnerships and \nnetworks essential to specialist college status. How are the emergent roles of specialist \nstaff being recognised and managed? How are initial teacher training and continuing \nprofessional development systems responding? \n\u2022 Momentum is gathered fast once specialist status is awarded and succession planning \nis essential for key specialist posts to avoid setbacks and breaks in continuity. How \ncan this be managed effectively? \n\u2022 GCSE results would have been a poor indicator of the success witnessed over three \nyears in this case study. How can the breadth and depth of contribution made possible \nthrough specialist college status be recorded, compared and evaluated more \neffectively? \n\u2022 How do specialist schools manage the plethora of overlapping government initiatives \nthat impact directly on their targets for maintaining specialist status and therefore \nhigher levels of funding? \n\u2022 What is the impact of an unsuccessful bid for redesignation when the whole impetus \nof a specialist school's structure and activity has been broadened with generous \naccompanying funding during the previous three- or four-year period? \n\u2022 Staff in specialist performing arts colleges have prolific opportunities for extending \nevening, weekend and holiday programmes and constant links with arts professionals. \nHow are these developments best linked to both curriculum enhancement and the \npotential for young people to gain qualifications? \n\u2022 The major catalyst for school improvement in this case study has been the increased \nfunding to improve the 'effective schools' factors, such as learning environment and \nextended opportunities. Since some English secondary schools are designated \nspecialist and others are not, a two-tiered inequitable system is probable. What is the \nimpact of this on staff, pupils, funding and opportunity, in non-designated schools? \nHow is the gap between specialist and non-specialist schools being monitored? \n\u2022 What is the impact of the policy to increase the number of specialist colleges on \nchildren's choices for secondary education, on their learning and future careers once \nsteered by a school's specialism? \n \nQuestions will continue to emerge as more is learned about the impact of specialist school \nstatus. Through this research we have indicated the need for alternative measures of success \nto be valued in addition to examination results. We have highlighted the effects of specialist \nschool status on the lives of managers, teachers and children who sought to maximise the \npositive differences such initiatives could bring to their schools. \n \nNotes \n1. On being awarded specialist status on the Specialist School Programme, a school becomes \nknown as a Specialist College; consequently the terms 'school' and 'college' are used \ninterchangeably. \n2.
