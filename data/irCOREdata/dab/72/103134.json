Perfect robustness within a network\nis unlikely to occur unless the network fulfils some very specific\ncriteria [2], and indeed such perfect robustness is probably\nrelatively rare in biological systems. However, the use of feed-back\nand feed-forward mechanisms allows systems to adapt to\nalterations in environmental conditions, thus achieving quasi-\nrobustness. With respect to drug metabolism, the processes\u2019 of\nadsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME)\nfollowing chemical exposure are targeting at reducing the level\nof the challenging chemical back to the pre-challenge state, i.e.\nzero. This, in itself, is a relatively simple aim; however, as these\nsame ADME processes\u2019 also control the fate of endogenous\nchemicals within the body, any alteration in ADME processes\ncaused in response to challenge by external chemicals will\npotentially impact upon these endogenous processes, potentially\nleading to pathophysiology [3], or on other xenobiotics, potentially\nresulting in clinically relevant drug-drug interactions [4]. There is\nthus a need for balance within the ADME system, such that\ncentral body functions are not overtly impacted by xenobiotic-\nmediated alterations (quasi-robustness), yet the system is still able\nto respond effectively to xenobiotic challenge, or extreme\nfluctuations in endogenous chemical levels suggestive of patho-\nphysiology (sensitivity). This balance is achieved through three,\ninterconnected systems: First, promiscuity within the ligand\nspecificity for transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes ensures\nthat for any given chemical, whether it is endogenous or\nexogenous in origin, several complimentary systems can mediate\nthe efficient removal of the stimulating chemical [5,6,7,8,9].\nSecond, activation of ADME pathways is closely coupled with the\nactivation of protective mechanisms that remove toxic damage\nelicited by stimulating chemicals should it occur before the\nchemical can be safely removed [10,11]. Third, impact of\nchemicals on ADME pathways are subject to complex feed-back\nand feed-forward loops at the nuclear receptor level, coordinating\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e16703\nexpression levels of both metabolic and transporter proteins with\ntheir requirement to handle fluctuating chemical levels\n[7,12,13,14]. These latter networks have become an area of\nintense study, as their dysfunction may underlie some of the\nobserved adverse effects observed following chemical exposures. In\naddition, manipulation of these networks represents an exciting\nnovel therapeutic area for the treatment of endogenous chemical\nmetabolism dysfunction [15,16].\nThe pregnane X-receptor (PXR, NR1I2) is an important\nregulator of a number of target genes involved in the metabolism\nof xenobiotics, including both metabolic enzymes and drug\ntransporters [17,18]. It is activated by a wide range of xenobiotics\n[19], and is itself regulated by a number of other nuclear receptors\n[14,20,21], highlighting it as an important node in the regulatory\nsignal network concerned with body responses to xenobiotics. In\naddition to this established role as a xenosensing nuclear receptor\nit is important to note that PXR target genes are also important in\na number of physiological functions, including haem, bile and\ncholesterol synthesis [22]: It is therefore pertinent to ask how\nPXR-mediated effects on xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism\nare balanced to achieve both the sensitivity to xenobiotic\nchallenge, but allow robustness in endogenous steroid metabolism.\nTo study this, we have examined the target gene set activated by\ntwo nuclear receptor agonists, lithocholic acid (LCA) and\npregnenalone-16a-cabonitrile (PCN). LCA is an endogenous bile\nacid, which acts as an agonist for PXR, the farnesoid X-receptor\n(FXR) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR), whereas PCN is an\nexogenous antiglucocorticoid, which acts solely as a PXR agonist.\nUsing DNA microarray technology we examine the hypothesis\nthat differential nuclear receptor regulation by the two chemicals\nallows an efficient response to the stimulating chemical, while\nminimising impact on endogenous steroid metabolism.\nResults\nDifferential activation of classic target genes for PXR, VDR\nand FXR target gene expression by LCA and PCN in\nprimary rat hepatocytes\nBoth PCN and LCA have been reported as PXR agonists [23],\nwhile LCA is also a known agonist for FXR [24] and VDR [25],\nwith the relative EC50s for target gene activation suggesting an\naffinity of VDR.FXR.PXR. To confirm that this differential\ninduction profile primary rat hepatocytes were grown in a sandwich\ncell culture system as described in Howe et al [26]; growth of\nhepatocytes between two layers of collagen permits correct\npolarisation of the cells and formation of functional bile cannaliculi,\nwhich may be important when studying the action of bile salts such\nas LCA. To determine a relative order of potency, we first examined\nthe transcript levels of classical PXR, VDR and FXR target genes in\nresponse to 48 hours exposure to either LCA or PCN: For this\npurpose CYP3A1, GSTA2 and ABCC2 represent PXR target\ngenes [23], CYP24 and KLK6 represent VDR target genes [25],\nwhile Fibrinogen b and UGT2B4 represent FXR-target genes [24].\nAs can be seen from Figure 1, the PXR target genes CYP3A1,\nGSTA2 and ABCC2 all demonstrate significant dose-dependent\nincreases in transcript levels in response to both PCN and LCA,\nalthough with a generally lower potency with LCA (Figure 1a). In\ncomparison, the VDR-target genes CYP24 and KLK6 are only\nactivated by LCA (Figure 1b), as is the case for the FXR target genes\nFibrinogen b and UGT2B4 (Figure 1c). The relative potency of\nLCA as agonist for PXR, FXR and VDR can be estimated through\nthe EC50s of induction for their respective target genes (Table 1),\nand is consistent with the published literature, being\nVDR.FXR..PXR.\nPCN and LCA activate differential nuclear receptor\nexpression patterns\nOne level of co-ordination of cellular responses to chemical\nchallenge is the control of nuclear receptor transcription and\/or\nactivity by other nuclear receptors. To examine this, we measured\nPCN and LCA-mediated effects on nuclear receptor expression\nlevels within primary rat hepatocytes. As can be seen from\nFigure 2, both PCN and LCA caused a dose-dependent\nsuppression of PXR transcript levels (Figure 2a); in addition, this\nsuppression was confirmed at the protein level, with PCN eliciting\na marked decrease in PXR protein levels, and LCA exposure\neliciting a smaller decrease (Figure 2b). In contrast, the expression\nof VDR and FXR appeared unaffected by either PCN or LCA\nexposure. We also examined the expression of the small-\nheterodimer partner (SHP), which can heterodimerise with\nactivated receptors and prevent transactivation of DNA as it lacks\na DNA binding domain [27]. SHP expression was unaffected by\nthe PXR agonist PCN, but was significantly increased following\nexposure of rat hepatocytes to LCA (EC50 = 12.766.5 mM),\nconsistent with its known role in response to bile acids [28].\nPCN- and LCA-mediated transcriptome changes\nFollowing the demonstration that both PCN and LCA activate\nclassical target genes for PXR (PCN and LCA), FXR (LCA only)\nand VDR (LCA only), we next examined the total transcriptome\nresponse to these agents. Exposure of sandwich cultured\nhepatocytes to varying concentrations of either LCA or PCN for\n48 hours resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the total\nnumber of genes activated, with similar total numbers of genes\naffected by both chemicals (Table 2). To further examine the\nresponse to either agent, and detect the major variables between\nthe two datasets, multivariate statistical analysis was undertaken.\nInitially, heirachical cluster analysis using centroid linkage and an\nuncentered correlation metric was performed, producing the\nheatmap seen in Figure 3a. The heatmap demonstrates a\nclustering of higher dose (5 and 10 mM) PCN-treated hepatocytes,\nwith a second cluster containing the low dose (1 mM) PCN, plus\nthe higher dose (50 and 100 mM) LCA samples: This latter cluster\npresumably reflects the similar PXR-mediated activation of target\ngene sets by these treatments, and is consistent with the notion of\nLCA as a lower potency agonist than PCN.\nNext, principle component analysis (PCA) was used to examine\nthe drivers for variability within the dataset. Figure 3b demon-\nstrates that whereas the initial trajectories of the plots are the same,\nbeing primarily described by principal component 1, as the dose\nincreases the trajectories separate along principal component 2.\nTo further examine the divergence of dose response trajectories for\nPCN and LCA, the PCA eigenvectors associated with both\nprinciple components were analysed. PC1, which accounts for\n38% of the total variation, has twenty eigengenes that drive the\nvariability along this axis (Table 3). In general, these eigengenes\nare involved in ADME processes, either being metabolic enzymes\nor transport proteins, and the majority of these have their\nzexpression increased by both LCA and PCN; a selection of these\neigengenes were analysed by Q-PCR, and the results are presented\nin Figure 4, demonstrating that these eigengenes are altered by\nboth PCN and LCA exposures.\nPC2, which accounts for 16% of the variability within the\ndataset, comprises 6 eigengenes (Table 3), including metallothio-\nnein 1a (MT-1) and metallothionein 2 (MT-2), with eigen values of\n0.46 and 0.34 respectively. These changes were confirmed by Q-\nPCR, demonstrating that these eigengenes are altered by LCA,\nbut not PCN, exposures (Figure 5a). The expression of MT-3 was\nalso examined, demonstrating it is expressed at very low levels in\nNegative Feedback in PXR Signalling\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e16703\nthe liver and unaffected by either PCN or LCA. Given the role of\nMTs in response to pro-oxidants [29], the expression of other\noxidative stress response genes, the glutathione peroxiodase family\n(GPx; Figure 5b) and superoxide dismutase family (SOD;\nFigure 5c) were examined. No effect was seen in GPx expression\nlevels, but LCA induced a significant dose-dependent increase in\nSOD1 transcript levels (Figure 5c). Thus, PC2 eigengenes are\ndifferentially affected by PCN and LCA, and reflect the\nantioxidant response elicited by high dose LCA exposure.\nTo examine the potential biological impact of these transcrip-\ntome alterations we undertook Gene Ontology (GO) analysis using\nthe DAVID suite to identify significantly over-expressed biological\npathways within the subset of transcripts regulated by PCN-alone,\nLCA-alone or by both chemicals. Table 4 shows that while the\nmajority of gene expression changes are exclusive to either LCA or\nPCN, with only 9% of transcript changes being shared, at the level\nof GO biological pathway terms there is significant overlap (47%),\nsuggestive of a highly similar biological response to both chemicals;\nthis also demonstrates the importance of analysis at the pathway\nlevel, rather than just the individual transcript level, as more\ninformation on likely biological effects can be seen. GO\nclassification terms are divided into five levels, with GO-level 1\nrepresenting terms of broadest meaning (e.g. physiological\nprocess), whereas GO-level 5 terms reflect much more precise\ndefinitions of a particular function (e.g. immune response). At the\nhighest level of GO analysis (GO5), commonly regulated biological\npathways, included those associated with cellular and protein\nmetabolism, which is consistent with the observed joint inductions\nof metabolic enzymes, demonstrated in Figures 1 and 4. For LCA,\nthere was a specific over-representation of pathways for nitrogen\nFigure 1. Induction of PXR-, FXR- and VDR-specific target genes by PCN and LCA.

Such data suggest that PXR-mediated transcriptional\ncontrol may be subject to both feed-back and feed-forward control\nmechanisms, such that PXR activation both activates target gene\nexpression and represses PXR expression. To understand the\ndesign principle behind this feed-back\/feed-forward system we\nconstructed two simple in silico models representing PCN\ninteractions with PXR and its target gene CYP3A1 (Figure 6a),\nand LCA interactions with PXR, FXR and VDR, and their target\ngenes CYP3A1, Fibrinogen B and CYP24 respectively (Figure 6b).\nThese models were paramaterised with kinetic and quantitative\ndata derived from published literature and the present study, and\ncan replicate the effects of PCN and LCA on primary rat\nhepatocytes: Down regulation of PXR (PCN and LCA), plus the\nup regulation of the nuclear receptor target genes CYP3A1 (PCN\nand LCA), FGB (LCA only) and CYP24 (LCA only).\nFollowing demonstration that the models were able to replicate\nthe biological scenarios, we next examined the impact of PXR-\nmediated feed-back loop on these networks. The model was\nTable 1.

Under stubborn PXR\nconditions, no negative feed-back for PXR is present, resulting\nin effectively increased PXR levels; such effects result in a\nsignificant increase in CYP3A expression level for any given PCN\nexposure, being 162% of the level resulting from 10 mM PCN\nexposure under normal conditions (Figure 7a). In comparison, no\nalteration is seen in the levels of CYP3A following LCA exposure\nunder stubborn PXR conditions (Figure 7b). Such a lack of effect\nmay reflect the significantly lower affinity of LCA for PXR, with\nsignificant effects only being observed at much higher agonist\nconcentrations. It is also important to note that the action of LCA\nas an agonist of VDR and FXR is not affected by the stubborn\nPXR condition, with no significant differences observed in the\ninduction profiles for FGB and CYP24, which reflects the higher\naffinities of LCA for these two nuclear receptors.\nTo examine a potential biological rationale for this PXR\nnegative feed-back loop we examined the impact of this\nattenuation of CYP3A expression on the metabolism of proges-\nterone, testosterone and cortisol, all of which are CYP3A\nsubstrates. Simulation of the metabolism of these three steroids\nacross a full dose response range of PCN or LCA demonstrated no\nimpact on the Km for testosterone, progesterone or cortisol\nmetabolism by CYP3A1 in the stubborn PXR system versus the\nfull network. However, there is a significant impact on the absolute\ncapacity (Vmax) for these processes following PCN exposure, due\nto the lack of decrease in concentration of activated PXR following\nPCN exposure in the stubborn PXR models. The relative Vmax in\nthe stubborn PXR system, as a percentage of the Vmax in the\nwhole network, was calculated and is shown in Figure 7:\nInterestingly, the resultant histogram for PCN treatment is\nbiphasic, with the lowest point between maxima occurring at the\nKd of PCN for PXR (,1 mM).\nTo determine if the attenuation of CYP3A gene expression\npredicted by the in silico model occurs in reality we next\nreproduced the in silico experiments in an in vitro setting: In\naddition, all components of the in vitro test system (cell line, target\ngene and PXR regulatory regions) were of human origin, allowing\nus to examine if the regulatory loop also functioned in the human\ncontext. The Huh7 human hepatoma cell line exhibits low level\nexpression of PXR under normal conditions, and usually require\naddition of a PXR expression plasmid to elicit activation of\nreporter gene assays [30], primarily due to altered chromatin\nstatus [31]; they thus represent a near-PXR null system. By\ncoupling the coding sequence for PXR to its cognate human\nproximal promoter (termed pPXR-PXR) it is possible to examine\nthe role of transcriptional level control of PXR expression on the\nactivation of downstream target genes such as CYP3A4. It should\nbe noted that in silico analysis of the human and rat PXR\nproximal promoter regions demonstrates a high conservation of\nputative transcription factor binding sites, with conserved binding\nsites for numerous nuclear receptors including PXR, VDR and\nFXR (data not shown).Regulation of pPXR-PXR by PXR ligands\ncould be demonstrated, with 10 mM PCN eliciting a decrease in\nPXR transcript and protein levels to 58% and 41% respectively,\ncompared to vehicle control; by comparison, no PCN-mediated\nalteration in PXR expression levels was observed using the pSG5-\nPXR plasmid, where PXR expression is under control of a\nheterologous promoter, was observed at either transcript or\nprotein level (Figure 8a).\nWe next examined the impact of this on PXR target gene\nexpression; Huh7 cells were co-transfected with a CYP3A4 SEAP\nreporter gene, plus either pSG5-PXR or pPXR-PXR. Cells were\nexposed to a concentration curve of PCN between 0.1 mM and\n25 mM for 48 hours and then SEAP activity measured. While\nPCN is a better agonist of rodent PXR compared to human PXR,\nit is still an effective activator of human PXR, as previously\nreported. [30]. In the current study, co-transfection with pSG5-\nPXR results in an increased CYP3A4 reporter gene expression\ncompared to basal PXR levels, with a maximal fold increase of 49-\nfold over vehicle alone and an EC50= 2.461.1 mM (Figure 8b).\nCo-transfection with the pPXR-PXR construct also resulted in a\nsignificant increase in CYP3A4 reporter gene expression following\nPCN exposure, with a maximal 31.6-fold increase and an\nEC50= 361.1 mM, but this was significantly lower than the\nincrease observed with pSG5-PXR. Such data is consistent with a\nscenario where PCN-mediated negative regulation of PXR\nexpression is used to attenuate CYP3A gene expression.\nDiscussion\nBiological response pathways to chemical challenge must exhibit\nboth sensitivity and robustness: The body must be able to respond\nrapidly to either challenge by xenobiotics or changes in\nendogenous chemical levels that could result in pathophysiology\n(sensitive), while at the same time not allowing this sensitivity to\nsignificantly impact on the endogenous metabolic processes that\nutilize the same enzymes (robustness). It is becoming clear that for\nthis to occur, the body must utilize a network of interactions,\nallowing the most efficient response to any given stimulus [3,32].\nTable 2.

Such a response is logical, given that the chemical is\nexternal by nature and, hence, the body will move to reduce its\nconcentration to zero through up-regulation of metabolic enzymes\nand drug transporters. By comparison, the transcriptomic response\nto bile acids is more complicated: At low concentrations, negative\nfeed-back on bile formation may be sufficient to prevent a build-up\nto toxic concentrations. However, as the level of toxic bile acids\napproaches that eliciting cholestasis, the body requires a more\nfrank response, including both an increase in catabolic processes\nand protective pathways. This differential response is demonstrat-\ned by the PCA for transcriptome responses to the two ligands,\nshowing first overlay and then divergence of the trajectories. Given\nthe relative EC50s for activation of VDR, FXR and PXR by the\ntwo chemicals, at the lower exposure doses it is logical that LCA\ntarget gene-activation is predominantly via VDR, while PCN\nactivation is through PXR. Given this disparate nuclear receptor\nactivation it is perhaps surprising that both agents activate a highly\ncorrelated gene expression profile. However, it is well established\nthat VDR can activate expression of target genes traditionally\nassociated with PXR through response element sharing [32,35],\nand this could explain the overlapping PCA PC1 trajectories,\nwhich are primarily determined by activation of metabolic genes.\nThe activation of a general metabolic response, combined with the\nactivation of VDR- and FXR-specific target genes, should be\nsufficient to cause a return to homeostasis at these lower\nconcentrations of LCA. However, if the concentration of LCA\ncontinues to rise, the percentage activation of PXR will also\nincrease, leading to increased metabolic activation of, for example,\nCYP3A1, plus the activation of specific target genes geared\ntowards meeting the response to cholestatic injury.\nA novel finding of the current work is the activation of\nexpression for the metallothionein 1a and 2 genes by LCA. Such a\nresponse can almost certainly be attributed to the oxidative stress\ncaused during cholestasis [36]. FXR knockout mice show an\nincreased susceptibility to bile acid-induced ROS damage,\nsuggesting that activation of these genes is, at least in part, under\nthe control of FXR [37]. However, in the current study, activation\nof these protective gene products occurs at higher LCA\nconcentrations, when PXR will be significantly activated. Zilliacus\nand colleagues have previously suggested that MTs can be\nregulated by PXR [38], and the data presented herein is consistent\nwith such a scenario. We would therefore postulate that PXR\nactivation by LCA becomes significant as LCA concentration\napproaches that eliciting pathophysiology, resulting in the\nproduction of protective mechanisms to reduce the associated\noxidative stress, namely increased MT1a and 2 and SOD1\ntranscript levels.\nTaken together these findings would suggest that the regulation\nof bile acid homeostasis in rats is through the action of the PXR,\nVDR and FXR nuclear receptors working as a partnership of\ncomplimentary pathways, adjusting the pattern of gene expression\nfor extent of divergence from bile acid homeostasis, aiming to\nensure healthy physiology. Such a interaction is demonstrated well\nin knockout mice, with FXR and PXR individual gene knockouts\nshowing a reduced, but still strong, response to bile acid loading\n[39], whereas the PXR\/FXR double knockout mice show a poor\nresponse to bile loading [40]. This poor response indicates that\nwhile CAR, LXR and VDR are all implicated in small areas of\nbile acid biosynthesis, FXR and PXR are the dominant receptors\nresponsible for control in this system [40].\nAs stated above, one level at which refinement of biological\nresponse to chemical stimulus can be achieved is through the\ninteraction of nuclear receptors signalling, via auto- or trans-\nregulatory loops, or through competition for ligands and\/or\nresponse elements. Herein, we demonstrate that PXR is under\ncontrol of a feed-back loop, with both PCN and LCA reducing\nFigure 3. PCN and LCA activate divergent transcriptome profiles in a dose-dependent manner.

Such data is\nconsistent with previous observations that over-expression of PXR\nin vitro results in a decrease in PXR reporter gene activity [21],\nwith these latter experiments being supportive for such regulation\noccurring at the transcriptional level. However, Maglich et al.\nobserved a 2.7-fold increase in PXR transcript levels in mice\nfollowing exposure to PCN, which was ablated in a PXR knockout\nanimal [41]. Whereas both findings are consistent with a PXR-\nmediated regulation of PXR transcript levels, they differ in the\ndirectionality of this change. The inconsistency of these findings\nmay be a product of the differing test systems, primary rat\nhepatocytes versus mouse in vivo, or the exposure period, 48 hours\nversus 28 hours. It should be noted that the findings presented\nherein are supported by changes at the protein level as well,\ndemonstrating the observed transcriptome level effects are\ntranslated to the proteome. Whereas such data is consistent with\nthe presented hypothesis, it should be noted that alternate\nhypothesis may be envisaged; for example, ligand stimulation\nmight increase targeting of the activated receptor molecule to the\nproteosome, as seen with other nuclear receptors [42]. Such an\neffect would also decrease protein levels, but not via a\ntranscriptional route. Given the transcriptional-level effects\nobserved both herein and by Maglich et al., it is likely that such\na mechanism would be complimentary, not alternate, to any\ntranscriptional level control; indeed, the altered protein levels\nresulting from degradation rate increases might actually be the\ndriver for an alteration in transcription rates, but further work\nwould be required to evaluate this. In addition, it should be noted\nthat no measurement of potential post-translational modifications\nhave been undertaken, which could further modulate the activity\nof a liganded nuclear receptor [43].\nThe decrease in PXR protein levels observed herein could serve\ntwo important processes: First, ensuring that the levels of free\nagonist remain high, potentially increasing interaction of the\nagonist with other nuclear receptors. Second, a reduction in the\ntotal amount of PXR protein will reduce the total amount of\nactivated PXR protein, as this is a function of receptor occupancy;\nsuch a reduction in activated PXR could impact upon the\nexpression level of downstream target genes, such as CYP3A1, as\nproposed herein. This would attenuate PXR target gene induction\nat higher agonist concentrations, preventing an over-response of\nthe biological system to hyper-stimulation. Given that order of\nnuclear receptor activation by LCA is VDR<FXR..PXR, then\nthe first scenario is unlikely to be important, as at concentrations of\nLCA where PXR negative feed-back becomes significant, receptor\noccupancy for VDR and FXR is already approaching maximal.\nWe therefore postulate that the second scenario is more probable,\nwhereby PXR negative feed-back is utilized to attenuate PXR-\nmediated activation of target genes at higher agonist concentra-\ntions. Such a hypothesis is supported by the in vitro data\ndemonstrating attenuation of CYP3A induction by PCN, and by\nthe in silico simulation demonstrating significantly higher turnover\nrates for three endogenous CYP3A substrates, testosterone,\nprogesterone and cortisol, when the feed-back loop is removed.\nThis data is highly supportive of the notion that the PXR feed-\nback loop is required for the robustness of steroid homeostasis in\nthe case of steroids that are CYP3A substrates, and is logical with\nregard to cellular energetic position, as it is far more efficient to\nattenuate degradation of these steroids rather than increase de\nnovo synthesis to compensate for increased degradation. Interest-\ningly, this attenuation appears to be biphasic, with maximal\nattenuation occurring at the Kd for the agonist, although the\nrationale for this is unclear. It should also be noted that this\nautoregulatory loop may not always be activated, and indeed we\nFigure 4. Transcript expression levels of PC1 eigengenes.

This minimal\/absent use of the\nPXR feed-back loop by endogenous agonists may be logical, as\nconcentrations of endogenous ligands high enough to significantly\nactivate PXR would only occur in pathophysiological conditions\nwhen it would be important to return to homeostasis as soon as\npossible and not limit the rate of CYP3A1-mediated degradation.\nIt is thus tantalizing to suggest that PXR can sense those ligands\nthat may impact upon endogenous metabolism and activate the\nautoregulatory loop, while disengage the loop for endogenous\nchemicals to allow a more efficient return to homeostasis. Such a\nbipartite response could reflect the recruitment of differing co-\nregulators to the agonist-PXR complex, either allowing or\npreventing repression of PXR gene expression. Regulation of\nPXR by other nuclear receptors has already been established\n[12,14], although the molecular mechanisms for such interactions\nFigure 5. Transcript expression levels of PC2 eigengenes.

However, no\nPXRE exists within the PXR proximal promoter; instead it is\ntempting to postulate that any such regulation would occur\nthrough interaction with the VDREs present within this regulatory\nregion, as PXR has already been shown to be able to function in\nthis manner [44]: However, further work is required to confirm\nsuch speculation.\nIn summary, the current study has demonstrated that PXR not\nonly acts as a xenosensor in the classical sense, but also potentially\nacts as an \u2018endosensor\u2019, allowing it to coordinate responses to\nchemical exposure in a tailored fashion dependent upon the nature\nof the chemical challenge and its likely impact on body\nhomeostasis.\nFigure 6.

For each reaction, a kinetic term is included,\ndetailing the mathematics underlying the interaction of the species:\nA full diagrammatic representation, plus paramaterisation values\nfor each model are presented as File S3.\nSupporting Information\nFile S1 Raw Gene Array Output. Quadruplicate cultures of\nprimary rat hepatocytes were exposed to PCN or LCA at the\nindicated concentrations for 48 hours. RNA was extracted and\ngene expression monitored using Affymetrix rat 230 v2 micro-\narrays. Fluorescent output for each probe on each array is\npresented, following normalisation using the Affymetrix algorithm.\n(XLS)\nFile S2 TaqMan Probe sets. Specific primers, plus TAMRA\/\nFAM dual labelled probes, were designed against the indicated\nRefSeq for each target gene using the Primer Express software\n(Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Probe primer sets were\ndesigned to cross an intron-exon boundary, with design param-\neters set as defaults for the software.\n(DOC)\nFile S3 Model Parameters. In silico models for both PCN-\nand LCA-response networks were generated using CellDesigner\n(v4.0.1), represented in the Systems Biology Graphical Notation\nNegative Feedback in PXR Signalling\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 February 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e16703\n(SBGN) images. Expression levels of individual species, kinetic\ndescriptions of reactions, plus initial state values for each network\nare also provided.\n(DOC)\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Dr. Phil Glaves (AstraZeneca) for his assistance\nwith the DNA microarray study.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: IB GGG MG NP.
