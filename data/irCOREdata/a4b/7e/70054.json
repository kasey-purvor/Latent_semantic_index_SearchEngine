PLoS ONE 2(7): e624. doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0000624\nINTRODUCTION\nThere is now considerable evidence that the two sexes differ in\ntheir rates of parasitism. Male-biased parasitism is thought to be\nmuch more common [1\u20134], although higher levels of infection\nwith blood parasites have been observed in female birds [5]. Males\nmay be more susceptible to infection and\/or they may transmit\ninfection more easily than females. It has been pointed out,\nhowever, that in populations where males have higher levels of\ninfection, they are also likely to be responsible for most of the\ntransmission to females [6]. There are several reasons why males\nmay be more prone to parasitism. Sexual size dimorphism in\nmammals is often strongly correlated with higher male mortality;\na comparative study identified positive correlations between male-\nbiased parasitism and the degree of sexual selection, and between\nmale-biased parasitism and male-biased mortality [7]. At least two\nexplanations have been suggested to explain these patterns. One is\nthat the larger body size and\/or higher growth rates of males may\nmake them easier targets for parasites [7]. Another is that males\nare more susceptible to parasitism due to the immunodepressive\neffects of the androgenic hormones (e.g. testosterone in verte-\nbrates) required for increased growth and reproductive effort [7,8].\nIndeed, since males tend to gain fitness largely through re-\nproductive competition and females through enhanced longevity,\nit is predicted that males might invest less in costly immune\nmechanisms in order to divert resources into traits that enhance\ncompetitive ability [9,10].\nGiven that male-biased parasitism appears to be ubiquitous, it\nmay have widespread implications for population dynamics.\nEcological models have the potential to exhibit extremely\ncomplicated behaviour [11\u201313] although natural populations tend\nto be relatively stable [14,15]. Here, we investigate the effects of\nmale-biased parasitism on the population dynamics. A common\napproach in theoretical studies is to assume that the population\ndynamics can be understood by examining only one of the sexes in\nisolation. This approach can be justified if males and females have\nsimilar life cycles, or if one sex is completely dominant, in which\ncase the dynamics are independent of the abundance of the other\n[16]. However, there are often significant demographic differences\nbetween the sexes [17\u201321]. For example, mammalian species with\npolygynous mating often show strong sexual selection for larger\nmales, which tend to have higher mortality [7,22\u201324]. The\nassumption of complete dominance also fails in many cases, where\nan uneven sex ratio may constrain reproduction due to limited\navailability of the scarcer sex. A consideration of sexual reproduction\nand the differences between sexual classes may have a profound\neffect on the dynamics, and appropriate \u2018two-sex\u2019 models should\ntherefore consider males and females separately [16,25].\nModelling separate classes for each sex has important implica-\ntions in terms of the dynamics, because births are dependent on\nboth sexes. Caswell and Weeks [16] analysed an explicit two-sex\nmodel where births were determined by a \u2018harmonic mean\u2019\nfunction, according to which reproduction depended on the ratio\nof males to females, and declined to zero in the absence of either\nsex. This birth function could be modified to accommodate\npolygynous or polyandrous mating systems. The authors also\nshowed how demographic differences between the sexes could lead\nto a range of complex behaviour, from periodic or quasi-periodic\ncycles, to apparently chaotic dynamics [16].\nFollowing on from this, Lindstrom and Kokko [26] compared\nthe relative stability of sexual and asexual populations, in a model\nthat included both polygyny and demographic sex differences. As\nthe intrinsic growth rate increased, the asexual population\nexhibited a period-doubling route to chaos.

Where\nmales experienced higher crowding, this had a destabilizing effect:\nchaos was observed at higher growth rates, and the dynamics no\nlonger showed period-doubling bifurcations. Polygynous popula-\ntions with higher male crowding were highly unstable, exhibiting\nchaos or cycles at all but very low growth rates.\nHere we build on an established theoretical framework and\nexamine how male-biased parasitism affects dynamical stability,\ncompared to an unbiased parasite, under different characteristic\nmating structures. In line with previous two-sex models, we\ninclude the effect of demographic sex differences. The basic model\nis derived from the model of Lindstrom and Kokko [26] for\na disease-free sexual population, and the host-parasite framework\nof May and Anderson [27]. Our epidemiological model therefore\nincorporates the specific demography of the individual male and\nfemale sub-populations. In particular, we examine the effect of\nmale-biased parasitism at different levels of case mortality.\nMODEL\nThe model of May and Anderson [27] describes a host-\nmicroparasite interaction with discrete, non-overlapping host\ngenerations. Disease epidemics occur within a cohort such that\nonly surviving hosts are able to reproduce. Here, we generalize the\nmodel to include both male and female hosts. For each sex, the\ndensities of uninfected, infected and immune hosts are denoted by\nSi, Ii and Ri respectively (here density is defined as the number of\nindividuals per unit area, where the area is assumed to be\nconstant). The total density of each sex is therefore Ni= Si+Ii+Ri.\nThe epidemiological dynamics are described by the following\nequations:\ndSi\ndt\n~{biSi(IizIj)zc1Ii \u00f01\u00de\ndIi\ndt\n~biSi(IizIj){(azc1zc2)Ii \u00f02\u00de\ndRi\ndt\n~c2Ii \u00f03\u00de\nHere i, j[\u00bdm, f \u0001, where m denotes males and f denotes females\n(i?j). The transmission rate of infection is bi (this allows for\ndifferent susceptibilities to infection for males and females, but\nboth types of host are equally infectious). There is an increased\ndeath rate due to the disease (virulence) given by a. Infected hosts\nrecover to the susceptible class (at rate c1) or to the immune class\n(at rate c2). These symbols are summarised in Table 1.\nThe condition for the host population to support the pathogen is\nthat its basic reproductive ratio (R0) exceeds unity [28,29]. Since\nwe are considering a heterogeneous population, the reproductive\nratio will depend on the parasite fitness in both males and females\nand on their individual densities [30]:\nR0~\nbf Nf\n(azc1zc2)\nz\nbmNm\n(azc1zc2)\n\u00f04\u00de\nThroughout the analysis, it is assumed that R0.1. The disease will\ntherefore persist and cause an epidemic. At the end of a given\ncohort, the epidemic is assumed to have completely run its course,\nsuch that there are no infected individuals left in the population.\nDefining (12ri) as the proportion of hosts who remain susceptible\nafter the epidemic [27], the densities at the end of the cohort are:\nSi,?~Ni(1{ri) \u00f05\u00de\nIi,?~0 \u00f06\u00de\nRi,?~Ni ri(1{a=(azc2)) \u00f07\u00de\nThe total density of surviving hosts is therefore:\nNi,?~Si,?zRi,?~Ni \u00bd1{ri a=(azc2)\u0001 \u00f08\u00de\nReproduction occurs according to the harmonic mean function\n[16,25]. The number of births, B, therefore depends on the\ndensities of both males and females at the end of the previous\ncohort, and births will fall to zero in the absence of either sex:\nB (Nf ,?,Nm,?)~\n2 kNf ,?Nm,?\nNm,?zNf ,? h{1\n\u00f09\u00de\nThe parameter h gives the average harem size. With monogamous\nmating, h = 1, and males and females are equally important in\nterms of births. Values of h greater than one correspond to\npolygynous mating, where the birth rate is more dependent on\nfemales [16,26]. The population is also assumed to experience\ndensity-dependence of the Moran-Ricker type [31,32], as\nTable 1.

Population growth is\ntherefore limited at high densities by intra-specific crowding,\nwhich for simplicity manifests in terms of increased infant\nmortality. Assuming births are equally likely to be of either sex,\nthe population densities in the next cohort are:\nNf~\nB (Nf ,?,Nm,?)\n2\nexp ({mf (Nf ,?zNm,?)) \u00f010\u00de\nNm~\nB (Nf ,?,Nm,?)\n2\nexp ({mm(Nf ,?zNm,?)) \u00f011\u00de\nNote that males and females may experience different levels of\ncrowding, as measured by the parameters mf and mm respectively.\nThe model suggested by May [33] implicitly assumes that\ninfection persists from one cohort to the next via repeated\ninoculation from some external source. The model of Koella and\nDoebeli [34] instead assumes that a small proportion of hosts are\ninfected at the beginning of each cohort due to vertical\ntransmission to offspring. We follow this approach and assume\nthat the proportion of infected offspring, v, depends on the\nproportion of surviving females who recover from infection, and\nalso on the parameter d measuring the efficacy of vertical\ntransmission:\nv~\ndRf ,?\nSf ,?zRf ,?\n\u00f012\u00de\nThis assumption is made to link the level of infection in one cohort\nto the level in the previous cohort, in order to allow the parasite\ndynamics to develop over several generations. It reflects trans-\nmission across the cohorts through any method including\nenvironmental contamination and infected individuals surviving\nto infect in the following cohort, as well as any direct vertical\ntransmission. The equilibrium densities (5)-(7) were determined\nusing computer simulations of the differential equations (1)-(3)\nuntil the system reached a stable state. Reproduction then\noccurred according to equations (10)-(11), with a proportion,\n12v, offspring classified as susceptible and a proportion, v,\nclassified as infected (according to equation 12). This process\nwas repeated 120 times to eliminate the initial transient effects and\nthe population densities were then plotted for the last 20 iterations.\nFrom the coincidence of the consecutive values it can be seen\nwhether the system converges to a stable point, limit cycle, or\ndisplays other complex behaviour. Note that our model clearly\ndelineates the periods of reproduction and mortality. Juveniles do\nnot experience any mortality due to the disease, which only\nmanifests as virulence once an individual has reached maturity.\nThere is no sterility or reduced fecundity due to vertical\ntransmission.\nRESULTS\nWe begin by reproducing the results of Lindstrom and Kokko\n[26], showing how sexual reproduction itself affects dynamical\nstability. Unbiased parasitism is then added to the basic model,\ncharacterized by equal transmission rates of infection to each sex.\nFinally, the effect of male-biased parasitism is investigated,\nrepresented as a higher transmission rate of infection to males\n(and a correspondingly lower transmission to females, in order to\nmaintain a constant infection rate overall). We investigate the\nimpact of parasitism at different levels of virulence, expressed in\nterms of the case mortality due to infection, x= a\/(a+c1+c2).\nDisease-Free Host Population\nTo investigate the effects of parasitism (male-biased or otherwise) the\ndynamical behaviour in the absence of disease needs first to be\nestablished. This has been discussed in depth by Lindstrom and\nKokko [26], and the main results are reproduced in Figure 1. A\nmonogamous sexual population with no density-dependent differ-\nences between the sexes exhibits the highest degree of stability\n(Fig. 1A). The inclusion of polygynous mating destabilizes the\ndynamics; however, the simple period-doubling route to chaos is\npreserved (Fig. 1B). Returning to the monogamous mating system,\nbut now assuming that males are more vulnerable to crowding, the\ndynamics become highly unstable at higher fecundities and no\nlonger follow the period-doubling route to chaos (Fig. 1C). A\npolygynous population that experiences a higher level of male\ncrowding exhibits complex dynamics for most levels of fecundity,\nwith alternating regions of chaos and limit cycles (Fig. 1D).\nUnbiased Parasitism\nWe now examine the effect of adding parasitism to each of the\nmodel systems. Initially, we assume a low case mortality such that\nx=0.08 (infected individuals have a 92% chance of recovery).\nThere is very little effect on the dynamics at this low mortality rate.\nThis is shown in Fig. 2A, illustrating the dynamics for a polygynous\nmating system with demographic differences (c.f. Fig. 1D).\nHowever, higher case mortalities (x) generally increase the stability\nof the system, as the initial bifurcation shifts further towards the\nright (Figs. 2B\u20132D). For high enough mortality rates, the\npopulations are completely stabilized (over the given range of\nfecundities). Although this behaviour is illustrated for a polygynous\nmating system with demographic differences, the results are\nqualitatively the same for all four mating structures: increasing\ncase mortality stabilizes the dynamics for higher values of the\nbifurcation parameter (fecundity).\nThe pattern of increasing stability with higher case mortality\nwas found to hold true only up to a point. Very high case\nmortalities (generally in excess of 95%) tended to promote cyclic\ndynamics. For case mortalities in excess of 99%, the system\nexhibited high-period cycles or chaos. This agrees with the model\nof May [33], which predicted chaotic dynamics for an asexual\npopulation. At such high case mortalities, the dynamics appear to\nbe determined almost entirely by the epidemiology, such that there\nis very little effect of mating system and\/or host demography.\nMale-Biased Parasitism\nNext we investigate male-biased parasitism, manifested as a higher\ntransmission rate to males (bm), and a correspondingly lower\ntransmission rate to females (bf). The overall \u2018force of transmission\u2019\n(bm+bf) is held constant to allow comparison with the unbiased\ncase (bm= bf). At low case mortality rates, there appears to be very\nlittle difference between male-biased and unbiased parasitism - in\nboth cases the population dynamics are unaffected by the addition\nof disease (c.f. Fig. 2A). At higher case mortalities, however, we\nidentified significant differences between male-biased and un-\nbiased parasitism. An example is shown in Figure 3. At high\nfecundity, unbiased parasitism results in two- or four-period cycles\n(Fig. 3A); the periodicity is much higher with male-biased\nparasitism (Fig. 3B). It is also worth noting that these cycles are\nof much higher period than is observed in the absence of\nparasitism (Fig. 1D; 14.5,k,17.5). Male-biased parasitism\ntherefore has the potential to destabilize its host population.\nWhether male-biased parasitism results in different dynamics\nmay also be dependent on the mating system of the population.\nThis is shown in the following examples (the parameter combina-\nMBP and Population Dynamics\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2007 | Issue 7 | e624\n5 10 15 200\n2\n4\n5 10 15 200\n5\n10\n5 10 15 200\n3\n6\n5 10 15 200\n5\n10\nA \nB \nC \nD \nFecundity (k)\nP\nop\nul\nat\nio\nn \nde\nns\nity\nP\nop\nul\nat\nio\nn \nde\nns\nity\nFigure 1.

We\nalso identified differences under polygynous mating systems: male-\nbiased parasitism may result in greater stability, compared to an\nunbiased parasite (Figs. 5A, 5B). In another case which includes\ndemographic sex differences, male-biased parasitism results in\ngreater stability at high fecundity, but is less stable at low fecundity\n(Figs. 5C, 5D). The dynamics of the corresponding uninfected\npopulations are shown in Figures 1B and 1D. Finally, a male-\nbiased system may be relatively less stable at all fecundities (results\nnot shown).\nMale-biased parasitism may therefore lead to either more stable\nor more complex dynamics; this may be dependent on the mating\nsystem and the case mortality. As a final example, we consider\na population with no density-dependent self-regulation on its\ngrowth rate, as in the model of May [33]. In terms of our model,\nthis is equivalent to mf=mm=0.

We assume an\nextremely high mortality of infected hosts (x=0.99), but if hosts do\nrecover then they cannot be re-infected (c1 = 0). For an unbiased\nparasite, the dynamics attain a point equilibrium only in fully\nmonogamous populations, and then only at very low fecundity. At\nhigher harem sizes we observe either two-point cycles or, at certain\nhigh fecundities, more complex dynamics (Fig. 6A). Under male-\nbiased parasitism, at the minimum fecundity the dynamics always\nreach a stable point, regardless of harem size. At higher fecundities\nwe observe either two-point cycles or (at moderately low harem\nsizes) more complex dynamics. A high degree of polygyny together\nwith high fecundity results in a point equilibrium (Fig. 6B).\nDISCUSSION\nSexual populations may exhibit complex dynamics independently\nof the effects of disease [26]. Parasitic infection may also result in\ncomplicated dynamical behaviour [33]. In this study we have\nconcentrated on the differences between male-biased and unbiased\nparasitism, in terms of the population\u2019s dynamics. At low case\nmortality, we found there is unlikely to be a significant difference\ndue to male-biased parasitism. This is likely to be because the\nmajority of infected hosts recover, and the difference in male and\nfemale densities between cohorts is therefore marginal. At higher\ncase mortalities, male-biased parasitism may result in qualitatively\ndifferent dynamics from those in the equivalent unbiased model.\nThe outcome has been shown to depend on a variety of factors\n(mating system, case mortality, demographic sex differences).\nThe potential for an Allee effect [36,37] is implicit in our choice\nof birth function (equation 9). This is essentially a cost of rarity for\nsexual populations, due to scarcity of breeding partners [38,39]. At\nlow density, sexual populations may therefore be expected to have\nreduced rates of reproduction. Population growth rates may also\nbe reduced at low density due to associated factors, such as social\ndysfunction and inbreeding depression [40]. In the absence of\ninfection, an uneven sex ratio may destabilize the dynamics:\nperiod-doubling bifurcations are a common feature of the disease-\nfree system [26]. In the host-microparasite model presented here,\nan Allee effect is theoretically possible whenever male-biased\nparasitism results in an uneven sex ratio.\nUnbiased parasitism may often stabilize a population\u2019s dynam-\nics (Fig. 2). Where a proportion of the population dies from\ninfection, this reduces both the male and female densities and\ntherefore the number of births. As such, infectious disease may\nstabilize the population by reducing its overall growth rate. At high\ncase mortalities, both male-biased and unbiased parasitism are\ncompatible with limit cycles (Figs. 3\u20136). At extremely high case\nmortality, the population may exhibit high-point cycles or chaos\n(Fig. 6). Population cycles are a feature of continuous models\nwhere disease transmission includes a free-living infective stage\n[28,35]. In particular, cycles are predicted when the increased\nmortality rate due to infection (virulence, a) is high. This agrees\nwith our results, in that we found cycles at high case mortalities.\nLimit cycles are also predicted at high case mortality in the discrete\nasexual model [33,34]. During a large epidemic, a highly virulent\npathogen reduces the male and female densities to low levels. The\nfollowing epidemic is therefore much smaller, with a greater\ndensity of hosts surviving to reproduce. This allows the population\n5 10 15 200\n2\n4\n5 10 15 200\n2\n4\n5 10 15 200\n2\n4\n5 10 15 200\n2\n4\nA B \nC D \nFecundity (k)\nP\nop\nul\nat\nio\nn \nde\nns\nity\nP\nop\nul\nat\nio\nn \nde\nns\nity\nFigure 5.

In the long-run then, the\npopulation oscillates between high and low densities [33,34].\nThere is considerable evidence for male-biased parasitism in\nwild populations of vertebrates [1,2,7]. This phenomenon may\nalso extend to contemporary human populations, since men are\nmore than twice as likely to die from parasitic and infectious\ndiseases than are women [41]. However, the mechanisms\nunderpinning these biases are not well understood. Parasite levels\nare determined by the interaction between exposure to parasite\ninfective stages and susceptibility to infection following exposure.\nIncreased male susceptibility to parasites is often attributed to the\nimmunodepressive effects of the androgenic hormone, testoster-\none; the so-called immunocompetence handicap hypothesis\n[2,8,42]. However, evidence supporting a link between testoster-\none levels and parasite susceptibility remains equivocal [43,44].\nIncreased male susceptibility to parasitism may also be due to\ntrade-offs between the levels of limiting resources allocated to\nsexually selected traits (including large size) and those allocated to\nimmune defence [7,45]. Increased male exposure to parasites may\nbe mediated by a variety of mechanisms. In mammals, male-\nbiased parasitism is associated with sexual size dimorphism, with\nmales being the larger and more heavily parasitized sex [7,46].\nLarge body size may lead to increased parasite exposure by virtue\nof offering a larger target for the parasite infective stages to exploit\n[7]. Large males may also have greater exposure to parasites, due\nto their larger home ranges and increased activity levels [7; but see\n41]. Regardless of the exact mechanisms generating male-biased\nparasitism, there is convincing evidence that males may also be\nresponsible for the majority of disease transmission. Perkins et al.\n[3] investigated the role of key hosts in the yellow-necked mouse,\nApodemus flavicollis. These are parasitized by the sheep tick, Ixodes\nricinus, the vector of the zoonotic tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)\n[47]. Sexually mature males of high body mass were identified as\na functional group responsible for driving most of the transmission.\nRemoval of this group (which constituted 26% of the total\npopulation) was predicted to reduce transmission potential by\n79%. In another study on A. flavicollis, Ferrari et al. [4]\nexperimentally reduced the helminth community to either sex, of\nthe dominant macroparasite nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus.\nReducing the parasite intensity of males significantly reduced the\nintensity in females, estimated through faecal egg counts, although\nreducing the intensity in females had no significant effect on the\nintensity in males. Furthermore, 20% of the most infected individuals\n(62% of which were males) were found to be responsible for 73% of\nthe total eggs expelled. These two studies both roughly conform to\nthe \u201820\/80 Rule\u2019, by which 20% of the individuals account for 80%\nof the parasite\u2019s transmission potential [48]. Male-biased parasitism\nmay often be responsible for disease persistence, by maintaining the\nbasic reproductive ratio (R0) of the pathogen above unity [3]. In our\nstudy, male-biased parasitism was modelled as increased relative\nsusceptibility. Once infected though, males may also cause the\nmajority of the transmissions to females, as it seems likely that the\nmost heavily parasitized group will be most responsible for infecting\nothers [6]. That being said, males may be intrinsically more\ninfectious, due for example to their increased activity and\/or host\nrange. Investigating the effect of a high male susceptibility and\ninfectiousness may form the basis of future work.\nOur model makes a number of biological assumptions, which\nmay limit its applicability. For example, we assume that males\nhave greater susceptibility to infection but do not exhibit any other\ndifferential effects. However, increased susceptibility to infection\nmay often be accompanied by higher virulence, as a result of\npathogen replication in hosts [29,49\u201350]. Where males have\ngreater susceptibility, this may be due to weaker immune function\n[9,51\u201353], which may also sometimes correlate with a higher\nvirulence. Reductions in mating rate and fecundity due to parasitic\ndisease may also occur. Sterilization effects are associated with\nsexually transmitted diseases in particular [54], and may often\naffect the sexes differentially. Our choice of birth function also\nimplicitly assumes random mating among healthy and parasitized\nindividuals. However, females may show preferential mating with\nregard to unparasitized males [55,56]. As outlined earlier, our model\nassumes non-overlapping generations such that all individuals are\neither susceptible or recovered (or deceased) before reproduction\noccurs, but it would be interesting to investigate the implications of\noverlapping generations. However, this would necessarily complicate\nthe analysis and our aim here has been to identify a difference rather\nthan to quantify it for a particular system.\nThe aim of this study was to examine the effect on dynamical\nstability of male-biased parasitism. At low case mortality there\nappears to be little difference compared to an unbiased parasite. At\nhigher case mortality, male-biased and unbiased parasitism may\nFecundity (k)\n5 10 15 20\n2\n6\n10\nH\nar\nem\n S\niz\ne \n(\nm\n S\niz\ne \n(h\n)\n5 10 15 20\n2\n6\n10\nH\nar\nem\n S\niz\ne \n(\nm\n S\niz\ne\nh)\nA\nB\nFecundity (k)\nFigure 6.

The\noutcome is influenced by the type of mating system, and\ndemographic sex differences can also have an effect. Our central\nfinding, that male-biased parasitism may result in different\npopulation dynamics compared to an unbiased parasite, may\nhopefully provide a useful basis for further research. Male-biased\nparasitism is increasingly being identified in ecological systems,\nand our model can be adapted to fit these. This may lead to some\ninteresting theoretical predictions, which could be measured\nagainst real systems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nAuthor Contributions\nAnalyzed the data: MM. Wrote the paper: MB MM AW KW.
