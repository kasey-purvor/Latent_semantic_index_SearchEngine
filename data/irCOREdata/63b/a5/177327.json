It produces high-quality research information on the effectiveness, costs and broader impact of health \ntechnologies for those who use, manage and provide care in the NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined as all \ninterventions used to promote health, prevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care.\nThe research findings from the HTA programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the National \nInstitute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee (NSC). HTA findings also \nhelp to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that they form a key component of the \u2018National \nKnowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA programme is needs led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are three routes to the \nstart of projects.\nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the NHS, from \nthe public and consumer groups and from professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS trusts. These suggestions \nare carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service users). The HTA programme then \ncommissions the research by competitive tender.\nSecond, the HTA programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research questions. These \nare assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThird, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA programme commissions \nbespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring together evidence on the value of \nspecific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They can cost from as \nlittle as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence, undertaking a trial, or other research \ncollecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer reviewed by a number of independent expert referees before publication in \nthe widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series\nReports are published in the HTA journal series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA programme, and \n(2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and editors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search, appraisal and \nsynthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication of the review \nby others.\nThe research reported in this issue of the journal was commissioned and funded by the HTA programme on behalf of \nNICE as project number 09\/21\/01. The protocol was agreed in October 2009. The assessment report began editorial \nreview in March 2010 and was accepted for publication in October 2010.

An economic model was constructed to assess the cost-\neffectiveness of seven alternative pathways for treating patients with unresectable and\/or \nmetastatic GISTs.\nResults: Five primary studies involving 669 people were included for clinical effectiveness; \nfour reported imatinib and one reported sunitinib. The data were essentially observational \nas none of the studies was designed to specifically assess treatment of patients whose \ndisease had progressed on 400 mg\/day imatinib. For 600 mg\/day imatinib, between 26% \nand 42% of patients showed either a partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD). Median \ntime to progression was 1.7 months (range 0.7\u201324.9 months). For 800 mg\/day imatinib, \nbetween 29% and 33% of patients showed either a PR or SD. Median overall survival \n(OS) was 19 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 13 to 23 months]. Progression-free \nsurvival ranged from 81 days to 5 months (95% CI 2 to 10 months). Median duration \nof response was 153 days (range 37\u2013574 days). Treatment progression led to 88% \ndiscontinuations but between 16% and 31% of patients required a dose reduction, and iv Abstract\n23% required a dose delay. There was a statistically significant increase in the severity of \nfatigue (p < 0.001) and anaemia (p = 0.015) following dose escalation. For sunitinib, median \nOS was 90 weeks (95% CI 73 to 106 weeks). For the cost-effectiveness review, only one \nfull-text study and one abstract were identified, comparing imatinib at an escalated dose, \nsunitinib and BSC, although neither was based on a UK context. The definition of BSC \nwas not consistent across the studies, and the pattern of resources (including drugs for \ntreatment) and measures of effectiveness also varied. Within the model, BSC (assumed \nto include continuing medication to prevent tumour flare) was the least costly and least \neffective. It would be the care pathway most likely to be cost-effective when the cost per \nquality-adjusted life-year threshold was < \u00a325,000. Imatinib at 600 mg\/day was most likely \nto be cost-effective at a threshold between \u00a325,000 and \u00a345,000. Imatinib at 600 mg\/day \nfollowed by further escalation followed by sunitinib was most likely to be cost-effective at a \nthreshold > \u00a345,000.\nLimitations: The evidence base was sparse, data were non-randomised and potentially \nbiased. The economic model results are surrounded by a considerable degree of \nuncertainty and open to biases of unknown magnitude and direction.\nConclusions: Around one-third of patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST, who \nfail on 400 mg\/day of imatinib, may show response or SD with escalated doses. Between \na threshold of \u00a325,000 and \u00a345,000, provision of an escalated dose of imatinib would be \nmost likely to be cost-effective. However, these results should be interpreted with caution \nowing to the limited evidence available on outcomes following imatinib dose escalation or \nsunitinib for this group of patients.\nFunding: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology \nAssessment programme.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

The median age of patients at diagnosis is between 50 and 60 years, and \ndiagnosis typically depends upon morphological and clinical features being consistent with \npositive KIT\/CD117 protein expression. Surgical resection is potentially curative but some \npatients will have unresectable and\/or metastatic disease. Conventional chemotherapy and \nradiotherapy are ineffective in the management of unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST and \nsymptom control through best supportive care (BSC) was the main treatment available until \nimatinib (Glivec\uf6da, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK) at a dose of 400 mg\/day was recommended \nin the 2004 guidance of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), as \nfirst-line management for those with KIT (CD117)-positive unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST. \nDose escalation upon disease progression after initially responding at the 400 mg\/day dose was \nnot recommended, although other recent guidelines have recommended dose escalation to a \nmaximum dose of 800 mg\/day, particularly for those patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic \nGIST who also have specific exon mutations in the KIT gene. Since the 2004 guidance, sunitinib \nmalate (Sutent\uf6da, Pfizer UK), another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been licensed for the treatment \nof people with unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST. NICE guidance recommends sunitinib as \na treatment option for people with unresectable and\/or metastatic malignant GISTs if imatinib \ntreatment has failed because of resistance or intolerance, and the drug cost of sunitinib for the \nfirst treatment cycle is met by the manufacturer.\nObjectives\nThe aim was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of imatinib at escalated doses of \n600 and 800 mg\/day following progression of disease at a dose of 400 mg\/day, compared with \nsunitinib, or the provision of BSC only for patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs. \nParticular subgroups of interest were patients with specific KIT mutations.\nMethods\nElectronic searches were undertaken to identify published and ongoing randomised controlled \ntrials (RCTs), non-randomised comparative studies and case series. Participants were adult \npatients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs whose disease had progressed on an imatinib \ndose of 400 mg\/day. The interventions considered were imatinib at doses of 600 and 800 mg\/day, \nsunitinib, or BSC only. Outcomes considered included overall response, overall survival (OS), \ndisease-free survival, progression-free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure, health-related \nquality of life (HRQoL) and adverse effects.\nThe titles and abstracts of all identified reports were screened and full-text reports of potentially \nrelevant studies assessed. Data were extracted from included studies, including details of study \ndesign, participants, interventions, comparators and outcomes. These studies were quality \nassessed using a checklist developed for non-randomised studies and case series, adapted \nfrom several sources, including the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination\u2019s guidance for those \ncarrying out or commissioning reviews, Verhagen et al., Downs and Black, and the Generic x Executive summary\nAppraisal Tool for Epidemiology (GATE) (Verhagen AP, de Vet HC, de Bie RA, Kessels AG, \nBoers M, Bouter LM, et al.

The Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s \nrisk of bias tool was also used to evaluate the quality of sequence generation and allocation \nconcealment of RCTs. Data analysis was confined to a comparison of data extracted from \npublished Kaplan\u2013Meier curves, and a narrative synthesis of results was presented.\nFor the review of economic evaluations, electronic searches were undertaken to identify cost \nor cost-effectiveness analyses relevant to the study question. Selection of relevant papers used \nsimilar methods to the review of clinical effectiveness. For included studies, data were extracted \nand critically appraised according to the guidelines produced by the Centre of Reviews and \nDissemination for the critical appraisal of economic evaluations, and guidelines relevant to \nmodelling studies. A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of seven \nclinically plausible alternative care pathways. The data used to populate the model were derived \nfrom the review of clinical effectiveness as well as the review of economic studies. Within the \nmodel people were assumed to move to the next therapy specified for a care pathway unless they \nhad responded to treatment. All pathways ended with BSC, which patients would enter if they \nhad exhausted all other treatments in a pathway. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity \nanalyses were conducted. The latter was restricted to considering distributions for the probability \nof death and non-response to focus attention on uncertainty in these data.\nResults\nClinical effectiveness\nFive studies (containing 669 patients in relevant treatment arms) met the inclusion criteria, with \nfour (n = 318) reporting outcomes for patients who received escalated doses of imatinib and \none (n = 351) reporting outcomes for patients who received sunitinib. No studies meeting our \ninclusion criteria were identified for BSC. The included studies were essentially observational \nin nature and subject to the biases associated with such data, consisting mostly of reporting \nof subgroups of patients who had been enrolled in RCTs that were not designed to assess the \neffects of dose escalation on patients with advanced and\/or metastatic GIST whose disease had \nprogressed on the 400 mg\/day dose. Therefore, the selection of patients was neither randomised \nnor consecutive.\nAt an escalated dose of 600 mg\/day, between 26% and 42% of patients showed either a partial \nresponse (PR) or stable disease (SD). Median time to progression was 1.7 months (range \n0.7\u201324.9 months). No data on other outcomes were available.\nAt an escalated dose of 800 mg\/day between 29% and 33% of patients showed either a PR or SD. \nThe median OS was 19 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 13 to 23 months]. PFS ranged from \n81 days to 5 months (95% CI 2 to 10 months). The median duration of response was 153 days \n(range 37\u2013574 days). Treatment progression led to 88% discontinuations but between 16% and \n31% of patients required a dose reduction, and 23% required a dose delay. There was a statistically \nsignificant increase in the severity of fatigue (p < 0.001) and anaemia (p = 0.015) following \ndose escalation.\nFor sunitinib, median OS was 90 weeks (95% CI 73 to 106 weeks). No data were available for \nother outcomes.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\nxi   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\nInsufficient data were available on the subgroup population of interest with KIT mutations, and \nthese were not considered in the economic analysis.\nCost-effectiveness\nAlthough seven economic studies were identified, only one full-text study and one abstract, \ncomparing imatinib at an escalated dose, sunitinib and BSC, were identified. Neither was based \non a UK context. The definition of BSC was not consistent across the studies, and the pattern of \nresources (including drugs for treatment) and measures of effectiveness also varied.\nFor economic evaluation, a Markov model was developed to compare the alternative treatment \nstrategies for people with KIT (CD117)-positive unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs, whose \ndisease has progressed on treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg\/day.\nThe assumed pathway of the model\nThe model was based on seven clinically plausible care pathways. The states considered in the \nmodel were those thought to reflect care pathways for people with GIST. Patients entering the \npathways were those who failed on imatinib 400 mg\/day. The alternative treatments considered \nwere imatinib 600 mg\/day, imatinib 800 mg\/day, sunitinib (within its licensed dose regimen), and \nBSC. The patient pathways considered in the model were:\n  \u25a0 start with imatinib 600 mg then imatinib 800 mg if the patient fails on 600 mg, or\n  \u25a0 start with imatinib 600 mg then imatinib 800 mg if the patient fails on 600 mg, and then \nsunitinib if the patient progresses or fails on 800 mg, or\n  \u25a0 start with imatinib 600 mg then move to treatment with sunitinib if the patient fails to \nrespond to 600 mg.\nWithin the model, Path-1, BSC (which was assumed to include continuing medication to prevent \ntumour flare), was the least costly and least effective pathway. It would be the care pathway most \nlikely to be cost-effective when the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) threshold was less \nthan \u00a325,000. Path-4, imatinib at 600 mg\/day, was most likely to be cost-effective at a threshold of \nbetween \u00a325,000 and \u00a345,000. Imatinib at 600 mg\/day followed by further escalation followed by \nsunitinib was most likely to be cost-effective at a threshold > \u00a345,000.\nSensitivity analysis\nThe results did not greatly alter under the majority of the sensitivity analyses conducted. \nHowever, all of the economic data were based upon point estimates for mortality and response \nrates that were, in turn, based upon sparse and potentially biased data.\nIt was also not possible, owing to lack of data, to make alternative assumptions about probabilities \nof death and response change over time, or reductions in utility associated with adverse effects \nof treatment. Further assumptions that were required to be made in the model were that patients \nwho move on to BSC would remain on treatment with imatinib at 400 mg\/day to prevent tumour \nflare (but that this would have no impact on effectiveness).\nDiscussion\nRelatively few relevant data were identified for this review and what data were available are \nessentially observational and non-comparative. Such data are potentially biased, with both the \nmagnitude and direction of the bias being uncertain. Therefore, all results should be interpreted \nwith caution.xii Executive summary\nApproximately one-third of unresectable and\/or metastatic patients with GIST who receive dose-\nescalated imatinib show either response or SD, which can be maintained over several months. \nHowever, few data were available for imatinib at 600 mg\/day and median OS for imatinib at \n800 mg\/day and sunitinib was < 24 months. Few data were available on adverse events but up to \none-third of patients may need a dose reduction or a dose delay. Patients may see a significant \nworsening of anaemia and\/or fatigue upon dose escalation.\nThe results of the economic model showed that pathways involving dose escalation would be \ncost-effective should the cost per QALY threshold be \u2265 \u00a330,000. Treatment with sunitinib after \nprogressing on imatinib at 400 mg\/day was not likely to be cost-effective. However, this result was \nbased on limited non-comparative data for this treatment and is probably unreliable.\nThere are a number of remaining uncertainties, including:\n  \u25a0 The results are suggestive of a benefit from dose escalation but the non-randomised, non-\ncomparative data available for review are potentially biased. This limits the usefulness of both \nthe review of effectiveness and the economic model.\n  \u25a0 There was a lack of evidence on quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes, which would have informed \nthe economic model, and would also be of importance to patients.\n  \u25a0 There was little evidence on response and survival on escalated doses of imatinib, specifically \nfor those with different mutations in the KIT gene.\n  \u25a0 There is uncertainty surrounding the effects of dose modifications and potential differential \neffects of sunitinib for both the population being given this drug because of intolerance to \nimatinib and those receiving sunitinib after failure on imatinib.\n  \u25a0 There is also uncertainty surrounding the nature and severity of adverse events and their \nimpact on quality and quantity of life and costs.\nConclusions\nImplications for service provision\nThere was very limited evidence available from very few studies on the effects of escalated doses \nof imatinib or treatment with sunitinib for the target population. The evidence that was available \nwas essentially observational in nature and subject to the biases associated with such data, \nconsisting mostly of reporting of subgroups of patients in RCTs that were not designed to assess \nthe effects of dose escalation.\nThe limited evidence base suggests that around one-third of patients with unresectable and\/\nor metastatic GIST who have failed on a dose of 400 mg\/day may show response or SD with \nescalated doses of imatinib, and those who do respond may have a reasonable chance of \nmaintaining this response over a longer period of time than would otherwise have been the case.\nFor all patients receiving either dose-escalated imatinib, or sunitinib, median OS, where reported, \nwas < 2 years.\nThe results of the economic model are surrounded by a considerable degree of uncertainty due to \nthe limited nature of the available evidence base, and the direction and magnitude of biases in the \nresults is unclear, so these results need to be interpreted with caution.

Historically, and based upon morphological appearance \nalone, GISTs were considered to be of smooth muscle origin and regarded as leiomyomas or \nleiomyosarcomas. Subsequently, electron microscopic and molecular analysis has demonstrated \nthat GISTs are a distinct tumour type arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal, and \ncharacterised by the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (CD117) protein demonstrated \nby immunohistochemistry.1 CD117\/KIT immunoreactivity now provides the diagnostic \ncriteria for GISTs, although there is recognition that a small proportion of GISTs (4%) are KIT \nimmunoreactive negative.2,3\nAetiology, pathology and prognosis\nRecent investigation has provided clinically significant insights into the molecular pathogenesis \nof GISTs. This has allowed the rational development of systemic therapies (including imatinib \nand sunitinib), provided robust diagnostic criteria for GISTs, and demonstrated the ability of \ncertain pathogenic gene mutations to predict clinical behaviour and response to therapy in GISTs, \ntherefore having potential application as predictive biomarkers.\nActivating mutations in the KIT proto-oncogene are an early and key event in the pathogenesis \nof GISTs, and present in up to 95% of cases.4\u201310 The protein product is a member of the receptor \ntyrosine kinase family and a transmembrane receptor for stem cell factor (SCF).11 Extracellular \nbinding of SCF to the receptor results in dimerisation of KIT and subsequent activation of \nthe intracellular KIT kinase domain,9 leading to activation of intracellular signalling cascades \ncontrolling cell proliferation, adhesion and differentiation. KIT mutation is necessary but \nnot sufficient for the pathogenesis of GISTs; other mutations are essential, and KIT mutation \nis absent in a minority of cases (< 5%).12,13 In the majority of KIT mutation-negative cases, \nmutational activation of the closely related tyrosine kinase platelet-derived growth factor \nreceptor alpha (PDGFRA) is the pathogenic event, and KIT and PDGFRA activation have similar \nbiological effects.12,13\nIt has been demonstrated that KIT and PDGFRA gene mutations are mutually exclusive7,8,10,14 and \nGISTs with no KIT mutations have either PDGFRA-activating mutations or no identified kinase \nmutations.13 GISTs that lack KIT mutations may still have high KIT kinase activity and so may \nhave KIT mutations that are not detected by conventional screening methods. Alternatively, KIT \nkinase activation may be due to non-mutational mechanisms.6\nDiagnosis of GIST is made when morphological and clinical features of the tumour are \nconsistent and the tumour has positive KIT\/CD117 protein expression.15 However, as noted \nabove, approximately 4% of GISTs have clinical and morphological features of GIST but \nhave negative KIT immunoreactivity.2 These KIT-negative GISTs are more likely to contain \nPDGFRA mutations.2 It is important in these cases, when KIT\/CD117 staining is negative, 2 Background\nthat other markers are investigated to confirm GIST diagnosis. Recent studies have shown \nthat a novel protein DOG1 is highly expressed in both KIT and PDGFRA mutant GISTs,16,17 \nand immunostaining for DOG1 can be used in conjunction with CD117 staining, and \ndiagnosis of GIST made on the basis of KIT and\/or DOG1 immunoreactivity.15 PDGRFA \nimmunohistochemistry should also be performed and positivity can assist with diagnosis. \nMutational analysis also plays a role in the diagnosis of KIT\/CD117-negative suspected GISTs, as \nwith consistent morphological and clinical features, positive mutation analysis for either KIT or \nPDGFRA is diagnostic.15\nWithout treatment GISTs are progressive and will eventually metastasise to distant organs and \nso are invariably fatal without any intervention. GISTs are resistant to \u2018conventional\u2019 oncology \ntreatments of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Prognosis is highly dependent on the \nresectability of the tumour; however, only 50% of GIST patients have resectable disease at first \npresentation.18,19 Ten-year survival for resectable\/non-metastatic tumours is 30\u201350%, and at least \n50% will relapse within 5 years of surgery, but for unresectable tumours prognosis is very poor, \nwith survival generally < 2 years without further treatment.18,19\nEpidemiology and incidence\nWhile GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumour of the GI tract, overall they are a rare \ncancer, accounting for less than 1% of all cancers of the GI tract.20 GISTs can occur anywhere \nin the GI tract from the oesophagus to the rectum, but most arise in the stomach or small \nintestine.21 They are rare before the age of 40 years and very rare in children, with a median age \nat diagnosis of 50\u201360 years.22,23 Some data show a slight male predominance but this is not a \nconsistent finding.22,24,25\nRetrospective studies carried out using KIT immunoreactivity as a diagnostic criterion have \nshown that GISTs have been underdiagnosed in the past.26,27 These retrospective population-\nbased reclassification studies provide the most reliable and accurate current estimate of an annual \nincidence of 15 cases per million, which would equate to 900 cases in the UK.15\nImpact of health problem\nThe symptoms of GISTs depend on the size and location of the primary tumour and any \nmetastatic deposits. While one-third of cases are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally \nduring investigations or surgical procedures for unrelated disease, severe and debilitating \nsymptoms occur in many patients and are invariable in those patients who have (or develop) \nmetastatic disease.28\nGastrointestinal stromal tumours of < 2 cm in size with no metastatic disease are usually \nasymptomatic. Larger primary tumours and those of patients with metastatic disease are usually \nsymptomatic and the most common symptom is GI tract bleeding, which occurs in 50% of \npatients, 25% of these patients presenting as emergencies with acute GI haemorrhage, either \ninto the intestine or peritoneum.29 Abdominal discomfort is a feature of larger tumours.30 \nOesophageal GISTs typically present with dysphagia, which represents the main symptomatic \nproblem in these cases, and colorectal GISTs may cause bowel obstruction. In metastatic disease, \ndebilitating systemic symptoms, such as fever, night sweats and weight loss, are common.\nCurrent service provision\nManagement of disease\nThere is wide consensus that the management of GISTs should be undertaken in the context of \ndiscussion of individual cases by a multidisciplinary team.15,31\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\n3   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\nManagement of resectable disease\nSurgical resection is the primary treatment for GISTs and offers the only possibility of cure. \nSurgical resection is undertaken with the aim of achieving a complete microscopic resection \n(R0 resection). Evaluation of the suitability and possibility of a complete microscopic resection \nof a GIST is made after appropriate preoperative assessment to determine stage and also the \nfitness of the patient for the procedure required. Preoperative assessment for staging includes (as \na minimum) a computerised tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and, in \nspecific circumstances, there is a role for endoscopic ultrasound, laparoscopy and angiography.\nAfter resection patients are followed up with protocols involving clinical examination and\/or \nsurveillance imaging, based upon relapse risk stratification by means of histopathological criteria \nof the resected tumour.15,32 Preliminary results from one randomised, placebo-controlled Phase \nIII trial suggest that adjuvant therapy with imatinib (400 mg\/day for 1 year) increases recurrence-\nfree survival following resection, and it is therefore suggested that adjuvant imatinib may have \nan important role to play in the prevention of recurrence of GISTs after resection.33 The results of \nother similar adjuvant trials are awaited.15 At present imatinib is licensed for adjuvant treatment \nof patients who are at a significant risk of relapse,34 but although Scottish guidelines recommend \nadjuvant imatinib (400 mg\/day) in patients considered to be of moderate or high risk of relapse, \naccording to histopathological criteria,15 a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence \n(NICE) Technology Appraisal for this indication is still ongoing,35 and it is acknowledged that, \nuntil more data are available from ongoing adjuvant studies, there is still uncertainty regarding \nthe optimal duration of treatment, and also the subgroups of patients who may or may not \nbenefit from adjuvant therapy. The use of imatinib as an adjuvant therapy may have implications, \nfor example with regard to the development of drug resistance, for the subsequent systemic \ntreatment of GISTs upon recurrence.36\nStudies are ongoing to determine the role of imatinib as preoperative therapy in resectable \ntumours.37 Nevertheless, the use of imatinib preoperatively to downstage tumours from \nunresectable to resectable is considered safe and clinically worthwhile.15 Similarly, preoperative \nimatinib has also been recommended to limit the extent and (accordingly) morbidity of resection \nin specific circumstances, for example to facilitate sphincter-sparing resection in rectal GISTs.\nManagement of unresectable and metastatic disease\nConventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are ineffective in the treatment of \nadvanced GISTs. Similarly, initial debulking surgery is not recommended unless there is an \nimmediate clinical need, such as to remove an obstructing tumour.\nImatinib (Glivec\uf6da, Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK) is a rationally designed small molecule \ninhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, including KIT and PDGFRA, and has provided the first \nclinically effective systemic therapy for GISTs. The European licence for imatinib was based \non a Phase II study of 147 patients who were randomised to receive imatinib at either 400 or \n600 mg orally taken once daily.38 The treatment was well tolerated, objective response rate was \nthe primary efficacy outcome and an overall partial response (PR) rate of 67% was demonstrated \nwith no difference between treatment arms. Long-term results revealed median survival of \n57 months for all patients.39 A concurrent study investigated dose escalation and established \n800 mg daily as the maximum tolerated dose.40 Phase III trials performed both in Europe and \nAustralasia [European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 62005 \nstudy], and in North America (S0033 Intergroup study), confirmed the efficacy of imatinib in a \nlarger patient population, and established the starting dose of 400 mg orally per day.41,42\nPrimary resistance to imatinib is uncommon, but acquired resistance is highly likely, and \nmanifest clinically by the observation of disease progression.41\u201345 Guidelines suggest that 4 Background\npatients should have a CT scan every 3 months while on therapy.15 Measurement of response by \nconventional criteria, such as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), based \non objectively measured changes in tumour size, may not occur, or may happen only after many \nmonths of treatment. This means that definitive evidence of patient response, and therefore \nclinical benefit, can be difficult to ascertain (at least initially). This has been addressed by the \ndevelopment of alternate methods of GIST response assessment, such as the \u2018Choi criteria\u2019 based \nupon tumour density as well as tumour size.46,47 Similarly, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission \ntomography (FDG-PET) has demonstrated some efficacy in predicting early response to imatinib \ntherapy,48 although it should be noted that PET scanning is not widely available in the UK as very \nfew NHS centres have access to this technology.\nIn addition, the assessment of progression of GISTs may be problematic if based on RECIST-\nbased tumour size criteria, as tumour liquefaction (cystic degeneration) can occur, which may \ngive the appearance of progressive disease (PD) although the tumour is actually responding.47 \nAccordingly, it is recognised that experienced radiologists should assess CT scans before \nconfirming progression.\nIt has been demonstrated that interruption of treatment results in rapid disease progression in \nmany patients with advanced GISTs.45 This includes patients with disease progression in whom \na symptomatic worsening or \u2018flare\u2019 has been described.49 Therefore, continuation of imatinib in \nthese patients has been common practice despite progression, as part of best supportive care \n(BSC).\nSeveral studies have reported further disease control after progression on an initial imatinib dose \nof 400 mg orally per day with dose escalation of imatinib to 800 mg orally per day, and this has \nalso become common practice.39,44 However, it should be noted that current NICE guidelines \nfor imatinib do not actually recommend dose escalation for patients with unresectable and\/or \nmetastatic GISTs who progress on an initial dose of 400 mg\/day.50\nRecently, sunitinib (Sutent\uf6da, Pfizer UK), another molecular-based treatment for GIST, became \navailable, and has been approved by NICE for patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST \nwho have progressed on treatment with imatinib.51 The NICE advice follows a randomised, \ndouble-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre Phase II trial in which 312 patients, who were \nresistant or intolerant to imatinib, received either sunitinib (50-mg starting dose in 6-week cycles; \n4 weeks on and 2 weeks off treatment) or placebo;52 the trial was unblinded early when interim \nanalysis showed a significantly longer time to tumour progression (the primary end point) \nwith sunitinib.\nTo date, no randomised trial has been conducted comparing imatinib and sunitinib. One had \nbeen planned but was stopped owing to poor recruitment.53 As new options for management \nof patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST have developed since the initial 2004 \npublication of NICE guidance for GIST treatment with imatinib, a review of the evidence \navailable on treatments currently used in clinical practice is required.\nCurrent service cost and anticipated costs associated with the intervention\nAs GIST affects mostly the middle-aged and older age population, the loss of productivity \nfrom the middle-aged population suffering from GIST is of concern. The median age of the \nGIST patients was found to be between 50 and 60 years,22,23 and incidence of GIST was found \nto increase with increase in age.54 The cost of different treatment strategies needs thorough \ninvestigation in a robust economic evaluation.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

Estimates from previous disease models suggest that in 2 years it would cost the \nNHS approximately \u00a331,160 to treat a patient with imatinib, and for 10 years this figure would be \n\u00a356,146 (2002 price year).54,55 Costs would differ when patients who fail to respond to imatinib \nare provided with higher doses or alternative treatments (e.g. sunitinib).50\nThe costs of treating patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST using imatinib were \nestimated at between \u00a31557 and \u00a33115 per month per patient, resulting in a cost to the NHS \n(England and Wales) of between approximately \u00a35.6M and \u00a311.2M per year (2002 price year).55 \nAnother study estimates that the total costs over 10 years for managing GIST patients with \nmolecularly targeted treatment would be between \u00a347,521 and \u00a356,146 per patient compared \nwith a cost of between \u00a34047 and \u00a34230 per patient when managed with BSC (price year \nnot stated).54\nVariation in service and uncertainty about best practice\nThe treatment of GISTs after progression on imatinib is generally decided on a case-by-case \nbasis by multidisciplinary teams, and the alternatives are dose escalation of imatinib, sunitinib at \n50 mg\/day (4 weeks out of 6 weeks) or, alternatively, BSC only (although due to the \u2018symptomatic \nflare\u2019 already mentioned this may include continuation of imatinib at 400 mg\/day). Many \nclinicians advocate initial dose escalation of imatinib and then consider sunitinib on subsequent \nprogression, but there will be variation in clinical practice depending on the specific needs of \nindividual patients.\nRelevant national guidelines\nUK guidelines recommend the dose escalation of imatinib, and\/or sunitinib following imatinib \nfailure,15,56 but also suggest that clinical decisions are made on an individual case-by-case basis, \nreflecting uncertainty regarding optimal practice.\nDescription of technology under assessment\nSummary of intervention\nImatinib\nImatinib (Glivec) is a rationally designed small molecule inhibitor of several oncogenic tyrosine \nkinases: c-Abl, PDGFRA and the KIT tyrosine kinases. Its therapeutic activity in GISTs relates \nto inhibition of KIT, although in cases with no KIT mutation the inhibition of PDGFRA is \nlikely to be of therapeutic importance.2 Imatinib is a derivative of 2-phenylaminopyrimidine, \nand a competitive antagonist of adenosine triphospate (ATP) binding, which blocks the ability \nof KIT to transfer phosphate groups from ATP to tyrosine residues on substrate proteins. This \ninterrupts KIT-mediated signal transduction, which is the key pathogenic driver for many GISTs. \nThe inhibitory activity of imatinib on KIT is highly selective, and minimal inhibition of other \nkinases that are important in normal cell function occurs, thereby affording a good toxicity and \nsafety profile.\nImatinib is licensed and approved for use in the UK NHS in KIT-immunoreactive positive \nadvanced\/unresectable GISTs.50,57\nSunitinib\nSunitinib malate (Sutent), is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting KIT, PDGFRA, all three \nisoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 6 Background\n(FLT3) colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic \nfactor receptor.58 Sunitinib activity in GISTs may predominantly relate to inhibition of KIT and\/\nor PDGFRA, and ex vivo investigation has shown that sunitinib can inhibit the kinase activity of \nKIT molecules harbouring secondary mutations conferring imatinib resistance.59 However, the \npotent antiangiogenic activity of sunitinib as a consequence of strong VEGFR inhibition may also \nbe important for clinical activity in GISTs.\nBest supportive care\nBest supportive care is not well defined or standardised, and can also be referred to as \u2018supportive \ncare\u2019 or \u2018active symptom control\u2019.55 It usually involves interventions to manage pain and treat \nfever, anaemia (due to GI haemorrhage) and GI obstruction,50 and can include palliative \nmeasures.60 A Cochrane review of supportive care for patients with GI cancer defined supportive \ncare as \u2018the multi-professional attention to the individual\u2019s overall physical, psychosocial, spiritual \nand cultural needs\u2019.61 It was argued that this type of care should ethically be made available to \nall treatment groups, meaning that treatment with imatinib or sunitinib could not be provided \nwithout concomitant supportive care as well in clinical practice for patients with GIST, although \nit is possible that treatment with BSC could be provided without additional drug treatment with \neither imatinib or sunitinib. It should be noted that the amount of care required as part of BSC is \nlikely to increase as the disease progresses and symptoms become worse.\nIdentification of important subgroups\nThe differential benefit from imatinib and sunitinib in subgroups of patients with GIST, whose \ntumours have different primary and secondary KIT mutations, has suggested possible benefits in \npersonalising first- and second-line therapy.\nPrimary KIT mutations are those that are pathogenic and present before any systemic treatment, \nwhile secondary mutations are those that have been identified after imatinib treatment and \nconfer resistance to imatinib. Identification of secondary mutations requires rebiopsy of tumours, \nand studies have suggested that the emergence of secondary (or acquired) imatinib resistance is \npolyclonal, so patients with GIST may acquire more than one secondary KIT mutation.62\nA meta-analysis of 1640 patients revealed that patients with KIT exon 9 primary mutations have a \nbetter outcome if treated at the escalated dose of 800 mg daily.63 Similarly, objective response rates \nto imatinib 400 mg\/day are higher in patients with exon 11 primary mutations than in those with \nexon 9 mutations, or those with no detectable KIT or PDGFR mutation.14,41 Therefore, advanced \nGIST patients with exon 9 mutations may benefit from immediate dose escalation of imatinib, \nand the benefit of dose escalation on progression may be more significant in this subgroup of \npatients and thereby have implications for therapeutic alternatives and choices on progression in \ndifferent groups of patients defined by KIT mutations. Recent studies have indicated that plasma \nmonitoring in GIST patients could assist clinicians\u2019 decision-making with regard to whether or \nnot dose escalation of imatinib is required for particular patients, including those with mutations \nin KIT.64\u201366\nSecondary mutations in KIT exons 13, 14, 17 and 18 are associated with acquired resistance \nto imatinib.43 Sunitinib activity after progression on imatinib has been demonstrated in GIST \npatients with imatinib resistance conferring secondary KIT mutations.62 However, both the \nprimary KIT mutation genotype and secondary KIT mutations may influence the clinical benefit \neffect of sunitinib in GIST patients who have progressed on imatinib.62 Interestingly, in contrast \nto imatinib, greater benefit from sunitinib (after imatinib failure) is seen in patients with primary \nexon 9 mutations or wild-type KIT as opposed to primary exon 11 mutations.62 However, it is \nnot clear how dose-escalated imatinib (800 mg\/day) compares with sunitinib in patients with \nprimary exon 9 KIT mutations. While the polyclonal emergence of resistance is an investigational \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

Practice is variable, and decided on a case-by-case basis. Some clinicians proceed with dose \nescalation of imatinib initially and then, on further progression, use sunitinib. Some guidelines \nand clinicians advocate returning to imatinib for symptomatic benefit, when there are no other \ntherapeutic options, and the cessation of imatinib in the absence of alternative treatment options \nis not recommended owing to the tumour flare phenomenon, with rapid deterioration in \nsymptoms observed in some patients.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

However, \nevidence suggests that tolerability of higher doses may depend on the extent of prior exposure to \nthe drug,66 and if in clinical practice escalated doses are prescribed only upon progression, these \ntrial data may not provide reliable estimates of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and \noverall survival (OS), quality-of-life effects or the extent of adverse event occurrence. In addition, \nif patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST are likely to attain different levels of clinical \nbenefit from different imatinib doses then clinicians\u2019 decision-making on appropriate dosages for \nindividual patients should be informed by the best available evidence.\nThe development of imatinib has represented a paradigm shift in the treatment of unresectable \nand\/or metastatic GIST, as, prior to its introduction onto the market, the only available treatment \nremaining for this population group was BSC, which, given the severity of this disease, represents \nessentially palliative intervention. Since the introduction of imatinib, other new treatments for \nunresectable and\/or metastatic GIST have become available, including sunitinib, which has been \nrecommended by NICE as the second-line treatment for the population of interest, after failure \non treatment with imatinib.51 As there are now various options available for treating unresectable \nand\/or metastatic GIST, it is therefore necessary to review the available evidence on imatinib at \nescalated doses, when compared with sunitinib, for patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic \nGIST, whose disease has progressed on the standard imatinib dose of 400 mg\/day.\nOverall aims and objectives\nThe aim of this review was to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of imatinib \nat escalated doses (i.e. 600 or 800 mg\/day) within its licensed indication,67 for the treatment of \npatients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs, who have progressed on imatinib at a dose of \n400 mg\/day.10 Definition of the decision problem\nThe objectives of this review will help facilitate decision-making on the most appropriate \ntreatment(s) for patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST who have progressed on \nimatinib at a dose of 400 mg\/day, by:\n  \u25a0 conducting a systematic review of the evidence available on the clinical effectiveness of \nimatinib at dosages of 600 or 800 mg\/day compared with sunitinib and\/or BSC\n  \u25a0 conducting a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of imatinib at dosages of 600 or \n800 mg\/day compared with sunitinib and\/or BSC\n  \u25a0 analysing available outcome data for particular subgroups of interest (e.g. patients with \ndifferent KIT mutations) in order to establish any differences in clinical effectiveness for \nspecific groups\n  \u25a0 developing an economic model to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost\u2013utility of imatinib \nat a dose of 600 or 800 mg\/day with those of sunitinib (within its recommended dose range) \nor BSC only.\nThis report contains reference to confidential information provided as part of the NICE appraisal \nprocess.

With the exception of the Executive Summary section, and most of the References \nsection, a large proportion of the submission document was highlighted as commercial in \nconfidence (CiC). Electronic copies of all the papers cited in the References section, including \ntwo labelled as CiC by the manufacturer, were provided. Apart from both of the CiC documents, \nthese studies had already been retrieved by our searching process and are discussed in Chapter 4.\nOf the two CiC reports provided, one (CiC information has been removed) was a report on the \nrandomised, Phase II, B2222 trial comparing imatinib at doses of 400 and 600 mg\/day. Patient \ndata from this trial that are relevant to this review have since been published by Blanke et \nal.39 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The remaining CiC report (CiC information has been \nremoved) provided a meta-analysis of data from the randomised, Phase III, intergroup S0033 \ntrial comparing imatinib at doses of 400 and 800 mg\/day, and the randomised, Phase III, EORTC-\nISG (Italian Sarcoma Group)-AGITG (Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group) trial, also \ncomparing imatinib at these doses.

All relevant results pertaining to the population of interest \nfor this review have been provided in Chapter 4 (Assessment of clinical effectiveness). (CiC \ninformation has been removed) but as more recent results for the study population of interest \nhave been published, only study characteristics information was used in Chapter 4 of this review.\nThe key points made in the manufacturer submission were as follows:\n  \u25a0 The limited number of data available from the key clinical studies and the paucity of data \ncomparing imatinib dose escalation with sunitinib and BSC prevent, in the opinion of the \nmanufacturer, the submission of a sufficiently robust economic analysis which meets the \nscope of the appraisal.\n  \u25a0 There are currently no head-to-head trial data comparing imatinib with sunitinib.\n  \u25a0 Sunitinib represents a third-line treatment, rather than second line as per the scope of \nthe evaluation, making it difficult, if not impossible, to conduct a robust and plausible \nindirect comparison of the two technologies. UK National GIST Guidelines56 recommend \nthat changing treatment to sunitinib should be considered only after patients have shown \nprogression on imatinib dose escalation.\n  \u25a0 Since the publication of TA86 clinical practice has evolved to consider dose escalation to a \ndaily dose of 600 or 800 mg, when patients progress on the standard daily dose of 400 mg, \nand this change in clinical practice is reflected within UK National GIST Guidelines.5612 Critique of the manufacturer submission\n  \u25a0 (CiC information has been removed.)\n  \u25a0 (CiC information has been removed.)\n  \u25a0 (CiC information has been removed.)\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

The searches were also designed to \nretrieve clinical effectiveness studies of the comparator treatments (sunitinib and BSC). In \naddition, reference lists of retrieved papers and submissions from industry and other consultees \nwere scrutinised to identify additional potentially relevant studies.\nThe databases searched were MEDLINE (1966 \u2013 September, week 3, 2009), MEDLINE In-Process \n(25 September 2009), EMBASE (1980 \u2013 week 39, 2009), Cumulative Index to Nursing and \nAllied Health Literature (CINAHL) (September 2009), Science Citation Index (SCI) (2000 \u2013 \n26 September 2009), BIOSIS (2000 \u2013 24 September 2009), Health Management Information \nConsortium (September 2009), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for primary research \nand the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (October 2009), the Cochrane \nDatabase of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (Issue 3, 2009) and the Health Technology Assessment \n(HTA) database (October 2009).\nOngoing and recently completed trials were searched in the following databases: current research \nregisters, including Clinical Trials, Current Controlled Trials (CCT), National Institute of Health \nResearch (NIHR) Portfolio, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials \nRegistry Platform, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations \n(IFPMA) Clinical Trials and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) \ndatabase. Recent conference proceedings of key oncology and GI organisations, including the \nAmerican Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Society for Medical Oncology \n(ESMO) and the European Cancer Organisation, were screened. Websites of the GIST Support \nInternational, and the drug manufacturers Pfizer and Novartis were also scrutinised.\nFull details of the search strategies used are reproduced in Appendix 1.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTypes of studies\nAn initial scoping search suggested that there would be few studies looking specifically at either \nof the named interventions (imatinib 600 or 800 mg\/day). Therefore, we considered all of the \nfollowing types of studies for the assessment of clinical effectiveness:\n1.  randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\n2.  non-randomised comparative studies, and\n3.  case series.\nIf the number of studies meeting our inclusion criteria was sufficiently large, consideration was \nto be given to limiting them by type of study design, and also possibly other factors (e.g. sample \nsize). Additionally, we planned to exclude non-English language papers, and\/or reports published 14 Assessment of clinical effectiveness\nas meeting abstracts, if the evidence base of English language and\/or full-text reports was \nsufficiently large.\nTypes of participants\nParticipants considered were people with KIT (CD117)-positive unresectable and\/or metastatic \nmalignant GISTs, whose disease had progressed on treatment with imatinib at a dose of \n400 mg\/day. If sufficient evidence was available, subgroup analysis was to be undertaken for \nthose patients with different mutations of CD117, as there is some evidence to suggest this \nmay affect their response to escalated doses of imatinib14,41,63 (see Chapter 1, Identification of \nimportant subgroups). In addition, subgroup analysis was also to be undertaken on methods used \nto identify response or resistance (e.g. FDG-PET or CT scanning) and the use of imatinib in a \nneoadjuvant or adjuvant setting for patients with previously resectable GIST, where sufficient data \nwere available.\nTypes of intervention and comparators\nThe interventions considered were imatinib at escalated doses of 600 and 800 mg\/day, \nrespectively, being prescribed with BSC. The comparators considered were sunitinib, prescribed \nwithin its recommended dose range of 27\u201375 mg and provided with BSC, and BSC only. As \npreviously stated, BSC is defined as \u2018the multi-professional attention to the individual\u2019s overall \nphysical, psychosocial, spiritual and cultural needs\u2019.61\nTypes of outcomes\nFor the assessment of clinical effectiveness, the following outcomes were considered:\n  \u25a0 overall response\n  \u25a0 overall survival\n  \u25a0 disease-free survival\n  \u25a0 progression-free survival\n  \u25a0 time to treatment failure\n  \u25a0 health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [e.g. European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) \nscores]\n  \u25a0 adverse effects of treatment (e.g. number of discontinuations due to adverse events).\nExclusion criteria\nWe excluded studies of animal models, preclinical and biological studies, reviews, editorials, \nopinions, case reports and reports investigating technical aspects of the interventions.\nData extraction strategy\nThe titles and abstracts (where available) of all records identified by the search strategy were \nscreened by two reviewers independently. Full-text copies of all potentially relevant reports \nwere retrieved. The full-text reports were assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria \nby two reviewers independently. Full-text papers and conference abstracts were assessed using \na screening form that was developed and piloted for this purpose. Any disagreements were \nresolved by consensus or arbitration by a third party. A copy of the screening form used can be \nfound in Appendix 2.\nA data extraction form was developed and piloted (Appendix 3). One reviewer extracted details \nof the study design, participants, intervention, comparator and outcomes, and a second reviewer \nchecked the data extraction for accuracy.

Non-randomised comparative studies were assessed using an 18-question checklist, \nwith the same checklist minus four questions used to assess the methodological quality of case \nseries. This checklist for non-randomised studies and case series was adapted from several \nsources, including the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination\u2019s guidance for those carrying out or \ncommissioning reviews,69 Verhagen et al.,70 Downs and Black,71 and the Generic Appraisal Tool \nfor Epidemiology (GATE). It assesses bias and generalisability, sample definition and selection, \ndescription of the intervention, outcome assessment, adequacy of follow-up, and performance of \nthe analysis. The checklist was developed through the Review Body for Interventional Procedures \n(ReBIP). ReBIP is a joint venture between Health Services Research at Sheffield University and \nthe Health Services Research Unit at the University of Aberdeen, and works under the auspices of \nthe NICE Interventional Procedures Programme.\nWe planned to assess the quality of RCTs using the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s tool for assessing \nrisk of bias.72 The tool addresses six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation \nconcealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues. \nEach quality assessment item had three possible responses: \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018no\u2019 or \u2018unclear\u2019, with space for \nadditional comments. Disagreements between reviewers over study quality were to be resolved \nby consensus and, if necessary, arbitration by a third party. Abstracts were not quality assessed \nbecause they were considered unlikely to provide sufficient methodological information to enable \nan accurate assessment of study quality. Methodological quality did not form part of the criteria \nfor the inclusion or exclusion of studies. A copy of the quality assessment tool can be found in \nAppendix 4.\nData analysis\nThe type of data analysis considered was dependent on the number of studies meeting the \nspecified inclusion criteria, and study design. Where a quantitative synthesis was considered \ninappropriate or not feasible, it was planned that a narrative synthesis of results would be \nprovided instead.\nFor relevant outcomes from randomised comparisons, it was decided that meta-analysis (where \nappropriate) would be used to estimate a summary measure of effect. Dichotomous outcome data \nfor the overall response outcome would be combined using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel relative risk \n(RR) method, and continuous outcomes by using the inverse variance weighted mean difference \n(WMD) method. For both of these estimates, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values \nwould also be calculated. Chi-squared tests and I2-statistics were to be used to explore statistical \nheterogeneity across studies, with possible reasons for heterogeneity explored using sensitivity \nanalysis. Where no obvious reason for heterogeneity was found, the implications would be \nexplored using random effects methods.\nThe pooled weighted ratio of median survival would be derived for OS, disease-free survival \nand PFS. The hazard ratio (HR) is the most appropriate statistic for time-to-event outcomes \n(i.e. for time to treatment failure). If available, the HR would be extracted directly from the trial \npublications, but if not reported it would be extracted if possible from other available summary \nstatistics or from data extracted from published Kaplan\u2013Meier curves using methods described \nby Parmar et al.73 A pooled HR from available RCTs could then be obtained by combining \nthe observed (O) minus expected (E) number of events and the variance obtained for each \ntrial using a fixed effects model.74 A weighted average of survival duration across studies was \nto be calculated. The chi-squared test for heterogeneity was to be used to test for statistical \nheterogeneity between studies.16 Assessment of clinical effectiveness\nWhere no RCT data were available, but non-randomised studies had reported relevant data for \nsurvival outcomes, assessment of the risk of bias and heterogeneity was to be undertaken using \nmeta-regression analysis.\nIt was expected that few studies, if any, would report direct comparisons of the intervention and \ncomparators, so (depending on feasibility and appropriateness) it was decided that, where non-\nrandomised evidence was available, meta-analysis models would be used to model survival rates \nfor interventions and comparators. A \u2018cross-design\u2019 approach was to be adopted to allow non-\nrandomised evidence to be included, while avoiding the strong assumption of the equivalence \nof studies. Evidence suggests that this approach would allow data from RCTs, non-randomised \ncomparative studies and case series to be included.75 Differences between treatments for survival \noutcomes were to be assessed via the corresponding odds ratio and 95% credible intervals. These \nresults are \u2018unadjusted odds ratios\u2019, but meta-analysis models adjusting for study type were also to \nbe used. The results from these models produce \u2018adjusted\u2019 odds ratios.76 Winbugs software (MRC \nBiostatics Unit, Cambridge, UK) was to be used for the analysis.\nAny reported data on adverse effects of treatment and quality of life (QoL) that were collected \nwere to be combined, using standardised mean difference, where appropriate.\nIn addition, and taking into account the type of evidence, the feasibility of using a mixed \ntreatment comparison model for indirect comparisons was to be considered.\nResults\nNumber of studies identified\nWe identified 3365 records from the primary searches for the review of clinical effectiveness. \nAfter title and abstract screening, 2441 articles were considered not to be relevant for this \nreview and were excluded. The full-text papers of 924 records were obtained and screened. One \nhundred and twenty-three of these full-text papers were non-English language publications. \nIn total, six full-text papers and 10 abstracts reporting four separate clinical trials and one \nadditional retrospective cohort met our inclusion criteria. An additional 49 papers were retained \nfor background information. The reasons for exclusion of assessed full-text papers are given \nin Table 1. A flow diagram of the screening process is outlined in Figure 1. Information on the \nreasons for excluding individual studies is provided in Appendix 5.\nIncluded studies\nSee Appendix 6 for a list of studies that were included in the review of clinical effectiveness. We \ndid not identify any RCTs, or non-randomised comparative studies, comparing the effectiveness \nof escalated doses of imatinib (600 or 800 mg\/day) with sunitinib or BSC that met our inclusion \ncriteria. One ongoing trial was identified comparing imatinib and sunitinib. However, this study \nwas stopped owing to poor recruitment.53 We identified five full-text reports of three randomised \ntrials of imatinib that contained relevant data for this review.14,38,39,41,44 The studies by Zalcberg et \nal.,44 Blanke et al. (S0033)41 and Blanke et al. (B2222)39 were designated as the primary reports \nfor the EORTC-ISG-AGITG (62005) trial, the S0033 trial and the B2222 trial, respectively. The \nstudy by Debiec-Rychter et al.14 met our inclusion criteria and provided additional information \nfrom the EORTC-ISG-AGITG (62005) study on response following crossover, while the study \nby Demetri et al.52 met our inclusion criteria and provided interim data from the B2222 trial on \nresponse following crossover.\nAn additional three abstracts were identified, with two68,77 reporting interim data for the S0033 \ntrial, and one reporting interim data for the EORTC-ISG-AGITG 62005 trial.78\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

One additional full-text paper detailing the results of a non-randomised \nretrospective study by Park et al.79 was also included. This study met our inclusion criteria as \nit also provided separate outcome data for patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST, who \nreceived escalated doses of imatinib on progression at an initial dose of 400 mg\/day.\nFor the comparator treatment of sunitinib, we identified seven abstract reports meeting our \ninclusion criteria. All were interim results of an ongoing, open-label sunitinib trial reporting \ninformation on participants recruited to the trial following failure at different doses of imatinib, \nincluding doses of \u2264 400 mg\/day.80\u201386 We designated the abstract by Seddon et al.86 to be the \nprimary report for this trial, as it was thought to contain its most recent results.\nFor the comparator treatment of BSC, no randomised, non-randomised or case series studies \nwere identified that compared either of the interventions (imatinib at a dose of 600 mg\/day or \nTABLE 1  Reasons for exclusion of studies\nReason for exclusion No. of studies excluded \nPatient had resectable GIST 24\nOutcomes not reported separately for patients with GIST 10\n< 10 patients in relevant study population 46\nImatinib dose is 400 mg\/day 13\nNo\/insufficient data reported for escalated dose patients 65\nNo imatinib dose reported 84\nNo relevant interventions 15\nTreatment not evaluated 11\nNo outcomes of relevance 10\nOther reason 61\n339\nRetained for background information 49\nReview articles 169\nLetter\/editorial\/correspondence\/symposium articles\/meeting reports\/expert views\/comments 117\nCase study\/case series < 10 patients 64\nNon-English language exclusions 123\nNot obtained 47\nTotal 908\nFIGURE 1  Flow diagram outlining the screening process for the review of clinical effectiveness.\n908 articles excluded\n(see Table 1 for reasons for exclusion)\n3365 titles and abstracts identified from primary searches\n924 selected for full text assessment\n16 articles included\n2441 excluded18 Assessment of clinical effectiveness\nimatinib at 800 mg\/day) with BSC, or provided data on relevant outcomes for the population of \ninterest for BSC only. It should be noted that studies published on the clinical effectiveness of \nBSC prior to the licensing of imatinib18,19 were not eligible for this review as our population of \ninterest was those who had failed on imatinib at 400 mg\/day; therefore all studies published prior \nto the availability of imatinib automatically failed to meet our inclusion criteria because BSC at \nthat time could not possibly have been provided following failure of treatment with imatinib at a \ndose of 400 mg\/day.\nCorresponding authors for each of the included trials were contacted in order to determine \nwhether any additional data could be provided specifically for the population of interest (i.e. \nthose participants failing on an imatinib dose of 400 mg\/day and receiving either an escalated \ndose of imatinib 600 or 800 mg\/day or, alternatively, sunitinib). For the ongoing, open-label \nsunitinib study, the corresponding author replied that no further information could be provided \nas the study was an official, ongoing trial by the manufacturer (Pfizer). For the imatinib trials, \nin the case of both studies by Blanke et al.39,41 our requests for information were forwarded to \nthe statistics team involved in the trials. The requested data for the S0033 trial were provided \non 17 February 2010. For the study by Zalcberg et al.,44 a response to our request was received, \nexplaining that an official data request form must be completed. This was submitted, and a \nfurther response was received on 9 April 2010 explaining that the data could not be provided \nuntil September 2010 (and then only if the request were approved). It was decided not to pursue \nthe request for data further, given the timelines for this project.\nTwo additional reports (CiC information has been removed) to the ones identified through our \nsearch strategy were provided for this review by the manufacturer and have been discussed in \nChapter 3, and are also discussed below. Both of these reports were marked as CiC.\nExcluded studies\nA list of 340 studies, originally identified as potentially relevant but subsequently failing to meet \nour inclusion criteria, is provided in Appendix 5. The studies were excluded because they failed to \nmeet one or more of the inclusion criteria in terms of the type of study, participants, intervention, \ncomparator or outcomes reported. It should be noted that all full-text screened studies on plasma \nmonitoring, as well as those on the use of FDG-PET technology for evaluating PD, did not meet \nour inclusion criteria. In addition, the types of participants were limited to an adult population, \ntherefore studies involving children with GIST were excluded. However, it should be noted that \nthe age range provided in the baseline data for the included study by Seddon et al.86 indicates that \nat least one child was recruited on to this trial, but, as the median age reported indicates that the \nmajority of patients in this trial were adults, the study was not excluded.\nStudies with a relevant population of fewer than 10 patients were also excluded. Changes to our \noriginal protocol were reported to NIHR in a progress report submitted on 9 December 2009.\nIn addition to the included studies identified above, nine studies (reported in 14 papers) reported \nsufficient information with regard to our inclusion criteria to be considered for potential \ninclusion in this review, subject to clarification from the study authors regarding specific aspects \nof the study. Corresponding authors for each of the nine studies were therefore contacted. \nResponses were received from four corresponding authors (GD Demetri, Ludwig Center at \nDana-Farber\/Harvard Cancer Center and Sarcoma Center, Boston, MA, USA, 2010; YK Kang, \nAsan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, 2010; P Rutkowski, \nSklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology Department of Soft \nTissue\/Bone Sarcoma and Melanoma, Warsaw, Poland, 2010; P Wolter, UZ Leuven, Leuven, \nBelgium, 2010; personal communication). In the cases of two responses, this resulted in the \nexclusion of the studies (five papers in total) from the review (P Rutkowski, P Wolter, personal \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

In the case of correspondence \nwith YK Kang, it was decided that the study by Park et al.79 could be included in the review \nwithout further clarification from the corresponding author.\nOf the correspondences that did not result in responses, one e-mail could not be sent \nsuccessfully87 and the remaining four authors did not respond.88\u201391\nCharacteristics of the included studies\nStudy characteristics data were available for the four full-text included imatinib studies39,41,44,79 and \nthe primary report of the included sunitinib trial.86 However, of these studies, only the studies by \nZalcberg et al.44 and Park et al.79 gave specific baseline information for the crossover subgroup \nof interest. Therefore, Table 2 provides details of all characteristics information provided for \neach crossover group, while Table 3 provides details of the same characteristics for all patients \nin the treatment arms of interest (initial randomisation to a dose of 400 mg\/day). In the case of \nthe EORTC-ISG-AGITG trial reported by Zalcberg et al.,44 relevant study characteristic data for \nparticipants initially randomised to the 400 mg\/day dose were not available. However, these data \nwere reported in a paper by Verweij et al.42 for the same trial. The paper by Verweij et al.42 failed \nto meet the inclusion criteria for this review as it did not provide any outcome data for patients \nTABLE 2  Characteristics of the included studies for the population of interest\nZalcberg 200544 Blanke S003341 Blanke B222239 Park 200979 Seddon 200886\nDrug assessed Imatinib Imatinib Imatinib Imatinib Sunitinib\nDoses given 400 mg\/day, \n800 mg\/day\n400 mg\/day, \n800 mg\/day\n400 mg\/day, \n600 mg\/day\n600 mg\/day, \n800 mg\/day\nCycle of 50 mg\/day \nfor 4 weeks, then \n0 mg\/day for \n2 weeks\nStart date (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\nDecember 2000 July 2000 June 2001 Unspecified\nEnd date April 2004 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\nMay 2006 June 2006 December 2007\nStudy countries Australia, Belgium, \nDenmark, France, \nGermany, Italy, the \nNetherlands, New \nZealand, Poland, \nSingapore, Spain, \nSwitzerland, UK\nCanada, USA Finland, USA Seoul, South Korea Unspecified but \n\u2018worldwide\u2019 and \n\u2018multicentre\u2019\nNo. of institutions involved \n(no. of countries involved)\n(CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n148 (2) 4 (2) 1 (1) 96 (33)\nLength of follow-up at time \nof analysis\nMedian of 25 \nmonths (maximum \nof 35 months)\nMedian of 4.5 years Median of 63 \nmonths (maximum \nof 71 months)\nMedian of 8 months \n(range 1.4\u201322.3)\nMedian of 51 weeks \n(range 0.1\u2013159)\nNumber receiving escalated \ndose of imatinib after failure \nof imatinib at 400 mg\/\nday, out of all of those \nrandomised to receive \n400 mg\/day\n133\/473 (28.1%) 118\/345 (34.2%) 43\/73 (58.9%) 24\/24 (100.0%) NA\nNumber receiving sunitinib \nafter failure of imatinib at \n\u2264 400 mg\/day, out of all of \nthose receiving sunitinib\nNA NA NA NA 351\/1117 (31.4%)\nNA, not applicable.20 Assessment of clinical effectiveness\nreceiving an escalated dose of 800 mg\/day imatinib upon progression at a 400 mg\/day dose, but as \nit provides information on the characteristics of all randomised patients (of whom a proportion \nwent on to receive an escalated dose of 800 mg\/day and formed the study population of the \nincluded study by Zalcberg et al.44), it was felt that the baseline data from this excluded study \ncould still be used.\nFour of the included trials reported data for imatinib,39,41,44,79 while the remaining trial reported \ndata for sunitinib.86 Two of the imatinib trials randomised patients to imatinib doses of either 400 \nor 800 mg\/day,41,44 one randomised patients to imatinib doses of either 400 or 600 mg\/day,39 and \nTABLE 3  Characteristics of the included studies for all participants randomised\nIncluded in this analysis\naEORTC-ISG-\nAGITG42 Blanke S003341\nBlanke B222239 (CiC \ninformation has been \nremoved) Park 200979 Seddon 200886\nAll those randomised to 400 mg\/day\nAll those who \nreceived escalated \ndoses of imatinib on \nprogression at a dose \nof 400 mg\/dayb\nAll those \nreceiving \nsunitinib\nNumber included 473 345 73 24 1117\nAge in years: median (range) 59 (49\u201367) 61.9 (18\u201387) (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n52 (31\u201373) 59 (10\u201392)\nSex: M\/F 283\/190 187\/158 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n18\/6 665\/451\nECOG\/WHO \nPerformance Status \nScore:\n0 217 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n4 420\n1 191 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n18 515\n2 48 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n2 134\n\u2264 2 (456) 332 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n(1069)\n> 2 17 13 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n38\nMissing 10\nRace\/ethnicity (n) NR NR NR\nWhite 273 CiC information has \nbeen removed)\nBlack 37 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\nAsian 25 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\nOther\/unknown 10 (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\nNumber having previous \nchemotherapy\n156 (32.9%) NR (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n3 (12.5%) 225 (26.8%)\nNumber having previous \nradiotherapy\n26 (5.5%) NR (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\nNR 78 (7.9%)\nNumber having prior surgery 410 (86.7%) (CiC information has \nbeen removed)\n20 (83.3%) NR\nECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; NR, not reported.\na  Baseline data for only the crossover patients from this treatment arm were available and are reported in Appendix 8.\nb  Participants in this study were part of a retrospective cohort.

From this it can be seen that the earliest study start date is that of the study (CiC \ninformation has been removed)39 (CiC information has been removed). The included sunitinib \nabstract did not report a start date.\nThree out of the four included imatinib studies reported an end date,39,44,79 and in the case \nof the sunitinib study by Seddon et al.86 a date was reported for the most recent analysis. \nThe manufacturer also made this information available for the study by Blanke et al.41 (CiC \ninformation has been removed). The ongoing sunitinib trial has the most recent update, while the \nstudy by Zalcberg et al. was completed first, in April 2004.44\nWith the exception of the study by Park et al.,79 which involved one centre in one country, all \ntrials were international and multicentre,39,41,44,86 with the sunitinib trial involving the most \ncountries85 and the S0033 trial involving the most institutions.41 The B2222 trial involved the \nfewest countries and fewest institutions.39\nThe longest length of follow-up occurred in the B2222 trial reported by Blanke et al.,39 in which \npatients were followed up for a median of 63 months, while the shortest length of follow-up was \nfound in the study by Park et al.,79 which gave a median follow-up for the study population of \n8 months.\nAmong the imatinib trials, 133\/473 (28.1%), 118\/345 (34.2%) and 43\/73 (58.9%) of those \ninitially randomised to imatinib at 400 mg\/day progressed and were given an escalated dose.39,41,44 \nIn the imatinib study by Park et al.,79 the study population comprised only those who were \ngiven escalated doses of imatinib so 24\/24 (100%) received an escalated dose. In the sunitinib \nstudy by Seddon et al.,86 351\/1117 (31.4%) of those who failed on imatinib and were entered \ninto the trial had failed on a dose of 400 mg\/day or less. Therefore, the study with the largest \nrelevant population was the sunitinib trial,86 while the study by Park et al.79 had the smallest \nstudy population.\nThe Park study79 had the youngest population, whereas the S0033 trial41 had the oldest study \npopulation. In (CiC information has been removed) studies, the number of male patients was \nhigher than the number of female patients, which concurs with the epidemiological trends in \ngender associated with this disease (see Chapter 1, Epidemiology and incidence).\n(CiC information has been removed) studies reported data on the performance status score of \nparticipants, although the study by Blanke et al. for the S0033 trial41 had combined the Eastern \nCooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status categories 0\u20132. Doing the same for \nthe remaining studies shows that the vast majority of participants, 456\/473 (96.4%), 332\/345 \n(96.2%), (CiC information has been removed), 24\/24 (100%) and 1069\/1107 (96.6%) in the \nEORTC-ISG-AGITG trial,42 S0033 trial,41 B2222 trial,39 (CiC information has been removed) \nPark study79 and the sunitinib trial,86 respectively, had a performance status score of \u2264 2.\n(CiC information has been removed.)22 Assessment of clinical effectiveness\nIn terms of prior treatment, (CiC information has been removed) two reported the number \nhaving previous radiotherapy,42,86 (CiC information has been removed). For the imatinib studies, \n3\/24 (12.5%), 156\/473 (32.9%) and (CiC information has been removed) of participants had \nundergone previous chemotherapy in the study by Park et al.,79 the EORTC-ISG-AGITG trial42 \nand the B2222 trial39 (CiC information has been removed), respectively, while 26.8% (225\/1117) \nof patients had received prior chemotherapy in the study by Seddon et al.86 With regard to \nradiotherapy, 26\/473 (5.5%) of patients in the EORTC-ISG-AGITG trial42 and 78\/1117 (7.9%) \nof patients in the sunitinib trial86 had received prior radiotherapy. (CiC information has been \nremoved) of participants involved in the B2222 trial reportedly had received prior surgery, (CiC \ninformation has been removed) while this figure was 86.7% (410\/473) for participants in the \nEORTC-ISG-AGITG trial,42 and 83.3% (20\/24) in the study by Park et al.79\nQuality of the included studies\nResults of the quality assessment for all four included full-text papers are summarised in \nFigure 2. No third party arbitration for quality assessment was required. The results of the quality \nassessment for each individual study are provided in Appendix 9. Three full-text studies assessed \nfor quality assessment were included in the review because they provided crossover data on \na subset of patients who were originally randomised to a dose of 400 mg\/day, but progressed \nand received an escalated dose of either 600 mg\/day39 or 800 mg\/day.41,44 The fourth study79 was \nassessed for quality because it included a retrospective analysis of a subgroup of a cohort of \npatients given treatment with imatinib at 400 mg\/day. The subgroup were patients who received \nescalated doses of 600 mg\/day and\/or 800 mg\/day after progression on the 400 mg\/day dose.\nAs the study populations of interest were not the original randomised populations, but the \ncrossover subgroup in three studies,39,41,44 and a subgroup of consecutively treated patients in the \nremaining study,79 quality was assessed using the checklist for non-randomised studies (detailed \nin Methods, above). Questions within this checklist that were specific to non-randomised \ncomparative groups (i.e. Q6 and Q16) were not considered applicable to the crossover subset \npopulation included in our review, and were therefore not summarised (see Appendix 4).\nFIGURE 2  Quality assessment results summary.\nRepresentativeness of sample?\nYes\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\nUnclear\nNo\nInclusion\/exclusion clearly described?\nSimilarity in disease progression at study entry?\nConsecutive sample selection?\nProspective data collection?\n Clear description of intervention?\nProcedure of intervention performance explained?\nValid and reliable outcome measure(s) used?\nAssessment of main outcomes blinded?\nFollow-up long enough to measure outcomes?\nNon-respondents, dropouts explained?\nLoss to follow-up likely to introduce bias?\nImportant prognostic factors identified?\nThe analyses adjusted for confounding factors?\nImportant outcomes considered?\nFacilities used for treatment explained?\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

The other study \nprovided inadequate information to allow judgement of the representativeness of the sample.79 \nWith regard to the randomisation process at trial level, the studies by Blanke et al.41 and Zalcberg \net al.44 used methods that adequately generated the allocation sequence to avoid influence of \nconfounding factors while Blanke et al.39 did not report sufficient data on the randomisation \nprocess. In the study by Zalcberg et al.,44 allocation to treatment was not concealed. Both the \nB222239 and S003341 studies by Blanke et al. reported inadequate information on allocation \nconcealment. All four studies adequately described inclusion and exclusion criteria (Q2). To \nconsider whether participants entered the study at a similar point in their disease progression, we \nlooked at data on their performance status. Three of the studies39,41,79 involved participants whose \nperformance status at the time of study entry was similar, while the study by Zalcberg et al.44 \nincluded participants with different performance status at study entry (Q3), although most of the \nparticipants in all populations had a performance status of < 2, meaning they were ambulatory \nand awake for at least 50% of their waking hours. None of the studies undertook consecutive \nselection of patients (Q4). Data were collected prospectively in all of the four studies (Q5).\nDescription of the intervention\nThe intervention was adequately defined by all studies (Q7). However, no study provided \nsufficient data describing supervision of the intervention (Q8) and no information was provided \ndescribing the types of staff involved, or the facilities used (Q9).\nOutcome assessment\nThe quality of all four studies was similar in terms of outcome assessment (Q10). None of the \nstudies had considered all of the outcomes of interest, but all reported the objective response of \nescalated imatinib dosing in patients with GIST, while one41 reported OS and two41,44 measured \nPFS. The study by Park et al.79 reported time to progression, and the study by Zalcberg et al.44 was \nthe only study that also reported adverse events for those on an escalated dose of imatinib. No \nstudy reported outcomes related to QoL.\nAll four studies used valid and reliable outcome measures (Q11), such as RECIST to assess \nobjective response or Kaplan\u2013Meier methods to estimate survival curves, minimising detection \nbias. Assessment of main outcomes was not blinded in any of the studies (Q12).\nFollow-up and attrition bias\nFollow-up was considered long enough to detect important effects on outcomes of interest in all \nbut one study where follow-up information was not provided and so this was unclear79 (Q13). \nInformation on those lost to follow-up was either not provided39 (and thereby likely to introduce \nbias) or not provided at a sufficient level of detail41,44,79 to judge whether those lost to follow-up \nwould be likely to introduce bias (Q14 and Q15).\nPerformance of the analysis\nFor both studies by Blanke et al.,39,41 important prognostic factors such as sex, performance status, \nneutrophils counts, etc., were investigated and multivariate analyses were performed at trial level \nbut this was not carried out for the subset of patients who crossed over. Similarly, Park et al.79 24 Assessment of clinical effectiveness\nidentified possible prognostic factors (but did not adjust for confounding factors during analysis). \nThe study by Zalcberg et al.44 also did not identify any prognostic factors or their effect on \nanalyses, or adjust for confounding factors (Q17 and Q18). Hence we considered the quality of \nreporting ambiguous in terms of the performance of the analyses.\nAssessment of effectiveness\nResponse\nFor imatinib at an escalated dose of 600 mg\/day following progression at a dose of 400 mg\/day, \nresponse is reported in the B2222 study by Blanke et al.39 and the study by Park et al.79 In the \nstudy by Blanke et al.,39 the median follow-up at this time was 63 months (maximum 71 months), \nand, at that time, 43 patients had crossed over from 400 to 600 mg\/day. Of these 43 patients, 11 \n(25.6%) showed either PR or stable disease (SD). However, it should be noted that one patient \nshowed response only after further escalation from 600 to 800 mg\/day. Some of the 43 patients \nwho crossed over would have had an initial response to 400 mg\/day before progression, as only \n11 patients in the 400 mg\/day arm showed a best response of PD.39 Interim data for this study \npopulation are provided in the study by Demetri et al.,38 where, after a median follow-up of \n288 days (maximum 9 months), nine patients had crossed over, with one showing PR at that \npoint, and two with SD.38\nIn the study by Park et al.,79 median follow-up was eight months (range 1.4\u201322.3 months) and, \nof the 12 patients who received an escalated dose of 600 mg\/day of imatinib, five (41.7%) showed \neither PR or SD.\nWith regard to response data provided by the manufacturer, (CiC information has been \nremoved). As a result, these data from the manufacturer\u2019s submission were not used in \nour review.\nFor imatinib at a dose of 800 mg\/day following progression at a dose of 400 mg\/day, response data \nare available from the S0033 study by Blanke et al.,41 the EORTC-ITG-AGITG trial by Zalcberg \net al.44 and the study by Park et al.79 Of the crossover populations in the S003341 and EORTC \ntrials44 (117 and 133 patients, respectively), three patients in each trial (i.e. six in total) had a PR, \nwhile 33 patients in the S0033 trial41 and 36 patients in the EORTC-ISG-AGITG trial44 had SD \nas a best response. This means that out of a total of 250 patients, 75 (30%) had a response after \nescalation from 400 mg to 800 mg\/day.\nResponse information from the study by Park et al.79 did not provide separate data for those \nwith SD and those achieving PR. However, it did state that four out of the 12 patients (33.3%) \nreceiving an escalated imatinib dose of 800 mg\/day upon progression at the 400 mg\/day dose \nachieved either PR or SD.79\nSome of the patients receiving dose-escalated imatinib to 800 mg\/day would have had an initial \nresponse to the 400 mg\/day dose, because only 42\/345 patients (12.2%) in the S0033 trial 400-mg \narm had a best\/only response of PD (or \u2018early death\u2019),41 and in the study by Zalcberg et al.44 this \nfigure was 61\/473 (12.9%).42\nInterim data for the EORTC-ISG-AGITG trial were provided for a data cut-off point of \n7 December 2003, at which point there were 2\/97 (2.1%) patients showing a PR, 30\/97 (30.9%) \npatients with SD, and 65\/97 (67.0%) patients with PD.78 Interim data for the S0033 trial, also from \nDecember 2003, showed that there were 5\/68 (7.4%) patients with PR, and 20\/68 (29.4%) patients \nwith SD, during crossover treatment with 800 mg\/day of imatinib, following failure of treatment \nat 400 mg\/day.68\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

However, the S0033 trial by \nBlanke et al.41 reported relevant outcome data, and at the time of the analysis (median follow-up \nof 4.5 years) noted that 76\/118 (64.4%) of patients had died.41 Median OS was 19 months (95% \nCI 13 to 23 months) starting from the commencement of crossover. Interim data for the S0033 \ntrial were also provided in the study by Rankin et al.,68 which stated that median OS at December \n2003 was 19 months.68\n(CiC information has been removed.)\n(CiC information has been removed.)\nTABLE 4  (CiC information has been removed.)\n(CiC information has been removed.)\n(CiC information has been removed.)\nTABLE 5  (CiC information has been removed.)\nFor sunitinib, OS data were available for those on 50 mg\/day of sunitinib who failed on a prior \nimatinib dose of \u2264 400 mg\/day from two abstracts of the same trial, taken at different follow-up \nperiods.82,86 The data from the study by Reichardt et al.82 were analysed after a median of four \ncycles.

Median survival at that time was 90 weeks (95% CI \n73 to 106 weeks) and 193\/351 (55%) were still alive.86 It should also be noted that further interim \nOS data were provided in another study by Seddon et al.,85 but although the date of analysis is \nthe same month as that reported by the studies by Reichardt et al.82 and Rutkowski et al.,83 the \nmedian OS reported differed, at 80.4 weeks (95% CI 60.3 to NA weeks), while the population \nwho had failed on doses of imatinib of \u2264 400 mg\/day was also less (307 patients).85\nIt was possible to compare OS with an escalated dose of 800 mg\/day, from the S0033 trial \nreported by Blanke et al.,41 with that with sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg\/day (provided in 26 Assessment of clinical effectiveness\n4 weeks-on\/2 weeks-off cycles of 6 weeks), for patients who had progressed on imatinib at a \ndose of 400 mg\/day.

To determine, by undertaking a systematic review of the literature, the cost-effectiveness of \nusing imatinib at an escalated dose of 600 or 800 mg\/day to treat patients with unresectable \nand\/or metastatic GISTs (whose disease has progressed with imatinib at a dose of \n400 mg\/day), compared with treatment with sunitinib (within its recommended dose range) \nor BSC.\n2.  To develop an economic model to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost\u2013utility of imatinib \nat a dose of 600 or 800 mg\/day; the use of sunitinib (within its recommended dose range); or \nBSC only, for people with KIT (CD117)-positive unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs whose \ndisease has progressed on treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg\/day or those whose \ntreatment with imatinib has failed owing to intolerance.\nSystematic review of existing cost-effectiveness evidence\nThe purpose of the review of economic evaluation studies was to identify published studies \nand assess their quality and usefulness for comparisons of treatments of GISTs; inform \nthe methodology of the proposed economic model; and identify data on the parameters \nof the proposed economic model (e.g. utilities for different health states, costs and \nepidemiological data).\nMethods\nSearch strategy for identification of published reports\nA comprehensive search was undertaken to identify studies that assessed the cost or cost-\neffectiveness of the alternative treatments used for GISTs. Databases searched included: \nMEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, SCI, Health Management Information Consortium, \nNHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), the HTA database, Cost-effectiveness Analysis \n(CEA) Registry and the Research Papers in Economics (RePEc). There were no language \nrestrictions in the search strategy and all databases were searched from 2000 onwards.\nThe search strategy used is provided in Appendix 10. The abstracts of the International Society for \nPharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) conferences from 2006 were also searched \nand, in addition, websites of key professional organisations, GIST Support International and the \ndrug manufacturers Pfizer and Novartis were scrutinised.\nThe reference lists of all identified studies and evidence syntheses, as well as submissions from \nindustry and other consultees, were also checked for additional potentially relevant references. \nThe methods for how the industry submissions were to be handled are described below, although, \nas noted in Chapter 3, no industry submission was reviewed for this technology assessment 32 Assessment of cost-effectiveness\nreview (TAR). The full texts of potentially relevant reports were obtained and assessed in terms of \ntheir relevance to the economic evaluation or cost analysis.\nQuality assessment\nIncluded studies were assessed using the guidelines of the Centre for Reviews and \nDissemination.69 Modelling studies were assessed against the Philips checklist.93\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTo be included, studies had to include a cost analysis or a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of \nalternative treatments for GISTs. Non-English language studies were excluded.\nData extraction\nInformation and relevant data were extracted by an economist according to the guidelines \nproduced by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination for the critical appraisal of economic \nevaluations. Where an economic evaluation was based on a modelling exercise, additional data \nextraction criteria developed by Philips et al. were applied.93,94\nHandling industry submissions\nInformation from the manufacturer was to be considered if it was submitted in accordance with \nthe 3 December 2009 deadline set by NICE. Any economic evaluations included in the company \nsubmission, provided they complied with NICE\u2019s guidance on presentation, would be assessed \nfor clinical validity, reasonableness of assumptions and appropriateness of the data used in the \neconomic model, using the methods outlined above. The strengths and weaknesses in terms \nof the methodology adopted, and reporting of results and conclusions, would be described. \nThe conclusions derived from the company submissions were then to be compared with those \nprovided by the review of the other existing evidence and the model reported in Economic \nmodelling (below), highlighting any differences in results. Any \u2018CiC\u2019 data taken from a company \nsubmission were to be reported in accordance with NICE guidelines.94\nSynthesising evidence\nData from the included studies on economic analysis and economic evaluation were summarised \nin order to identify common results, and to summarise the variations and differences between \nstudies. The studies that used economic modelling were critically reviewed with regard \nto, for example, model structure use, and how these models dealt with uncertainties while \npredicting results.\nResults\nResults of literature search\nIn total there were 250 papers identified from the initial search (Table 11). Of these, 18 were \nselected as potentially relevant abstracts, and 13 were included for further screening. From these \npapers, nine were selected for the review. Appendix 11 summarises the included studies.\nAs already noted no submission was received from industry reporting relevant evidence.\nCharacteristics of included studies\nOut of the nine studies, seven55,95\u2013100 reported a full economic evaluation that assessed both the \ncosts and cost-effectiveness of the alternatives compared. Of the remaining two studies, the study \nby Reddy54 is a review reporting information related to costs and health outcomes reported in \nother studies and did not undertake an economic evaluation. The other study,101 which is also a \nreview of the management of GIST with sunitinib, reports on, amongst other things, the cost of \ntreatment with sunitinib. \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

Two studies96,98 used non-randomised or non-trial patient data (from \nretrospective cohorts) to inform their economic evaluations.\nOne study55 reported an economic evaluation in a UK context, which was based on an industry \nsubmission to NICE for a previous TAR. Two studies95,98 reported a Canadian context, and \none study was from a US context.97 The remaining three studies were conducted in the context \nof Mexico,96 Spain99 and Brazil,100 respectively. Table 12 summarises the main features of the \nincluded studies.\nComparative studies\nImatinib and best supportive care\nThree studies55,97,98 compared imatinib with BSC. The study by Wilson et al.55 used the \nmanufacturer submissions (Novartis model) and compared imatinib and BSC, but in the imatinib \ngroup allowed for escalation of doses from 400 to 600 mg\/day for those who failed to respond \nor were intolerant to imatinib at the 400 mg\/day dose. The study by Mabasa et al.98 noted that \npatients included from retrospective cohorts in their analysis were given imatinib 400 mg\/day \nuntil disease progression, and later were allowed escalated doses of between 600 and 800 mg\/day. \nSix out of 56 patients in the imatinib groups of patients considered in this economic evaluation \nwere then allowed to switch to sunitinib therapy. The economic evaluation by Huse et al.97 \nconsidered imatinib at 400 mg\/day (see Table 12).\nImatinib, sunitinib and best supportive care\nTwo studies96,100 compared sunitinib, escalated doses of imatinib, and BSC or palliative care as \ncomparators for their economic evaluations. The Contreras-Hernandez et al.96 study compared \ntreatment with imatinib, sunitinib and palliative care. Both treatments (sunitinib and imatinib) \nwere compared with BSC in a model-based analysis. The doses for both the treatments were \nclearly specified (imatinib at 800 mg\/day and sunitinib at 50 mg\/day) as the study was based on \nprimary data collected from hospital records. The study did not include dose escalation with \nimatinib at a 600 mg\/day dose. Teich et al.100 compared sunitinib, imatinib at 800 mg\/day and BSC \n(see Table 12).\nSunitinib and best supportive care\nThe studies by Chabot et al.95 and Paz-Ares et al.99 compared treatment with sunitinib and \nBSC for patients with GIST who were imatinib resistant or intolerant. Chabot et al.95 did not \nspecify the dose of sunitinib used, or mention whether patients who were imatinib resistant or \nTABLE 11  Search results\nDatabase No. retrieved\nMEDLINE (2000 \u2013 October, week 4, 2009), EMBASE (2000 \u2013 week 44, 2009) 227\nMEDLINE In-Process (3 November 2009) (after de-duplication in Ovid) 0\nSCIa (2000 to 3 November 2009) 16\nHealth Management Information Consortiuma (September 2009) 0\nNHS EEDa (October 2009) 0\nHTA database (October 2009) 0\nISPOR conference abstracts 2006\u20139 7\nTotal 250\na  Numbers retrieved after de-duplication against MEDLINE and EMBASE search.34 Assessment of cost-effectiveness\nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\n \n1\n2\n \nC\nh\na\nr\na\nc\nt\ne\nr\ni\ns\nt\ni\nc\ns\n \no\nf\n \ni\nn\nc\nl\nu\nd\ne\nd\n \nC\nE\nA\n \ns\nt\nu\nd\ni\ne\ns\nS\nt\nu\nd\ny\nC\no\nu\nn\nt\nr\ny\n,\n \nc\nu\nr\nr\ne\nn\nc\ny\n,\n \np\nr\ni\nc\ne\n \ny\ne\na\nr\nP\ne\nr\ns\np\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\ns\nC\no\nm\np\na\nr\ni\ns\no\nn\ns\nP\na\nt\ni\ne\nn\nt\n \nf\na\ni\nl\ne\nd\n \no\nn\n \ni\nm\na\nt\ni\nn\ni\nb\n?\nO\nu\nt\nc\no\nm\ne\ns\n \nr\ne\np\no\nr\nt\ne\nd\nM\no\nd\ne\nl\nl\ni\nn\ng\nI\nm\na\nt\ni\nn\ni\nb\n \n4\n0\n0\n \nm\ng\n\/\nd\na\ny\nI\nm\na\nt\ni\nn\ni\nb\n \n6\n0\n0\n \nm\ng\n\/\nd\na\ny\nI\nm\na\nt\ni\nn\ni\nb\n \n8\n0\n0\n \nm\ng\n\/\nd\na\ny\nB\nS\nC\nS\nu\nn\ni\nt\ni\nn\ni\nb\nO\nS\nM\ne\nd\ni\na\nn\n \nO\nS\n \nS\nu\nr\nv\ni\nv\na\nl\n \nr\na\nt\ne\nP\nF\nS\nP\nr\no\ng\nr\ne\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\n-\nf\nr\ne\ne\n \nl\ni\nf\ne\n-\ny\ne\na\nr\ns\nT\ni\nm\ne\n \nt\no\n \np\nr\no\ng\nr\ne\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\nP\nF\nM\nL\ni\nf\ne\n-\ny\ne\na\nr\ns\n \ng\na\ni\nn\ne\nd\nQ\nA\nL\nY\nC\no\ns\nt\n-\ne\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\nn\ne\ns\ns\n \nr\na\nt\ni\no\nI\nC\nE\nR\nC\nh\na\nb\no\nt\n \n2\n0\n0\n8\n9\n5\nC\na\nn\na\nd\na\n,\n \nC\na\nn\na\nd\ni\na\nn\n \n$\n,\n \n2\n0\n0\n5\nP\nr\no\nv\ni\nn\nc\ni\na\nl\n \nh\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n \na\nu\nt\nh\no\nr\ni\nt\ny\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nY\ne\ns\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nM\na\nr\nk\no\nv\n \nm\no\nd\ne\nl\nC\no\nn\nt\nr\ne\nr\na\ns\n-\nH\ne\nr\nn\na\nn\nd\ne\nz\n \n2\n0\n0\n8\n9\n6\nM\ne\nx\ni\nc\no\n,\n \nU\nS\n$\n,\n \n2\n0\n0\n6\na\nH\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n \ni\nn\ns\nu\nr\na\nn\nc\ne\n \ns\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nY\ne\ns\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nM\na\nr\nk\no\nv\n \nm\no\nd\ne\nl\nM\na\nb\na\ns\na\n \n2\n0\n0\n8\n9\n8\nC\na\nn\na\nd\na\n,\n \nC\na\nn\na\nd\ni\na\nn\n \n$\n,\n \n2\n0\n0\n6\nB\nC\nC\nA\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nN\no\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nC\nE\nA\n \nu\ns\ni\nn\ng\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n-\ne\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\nn\ne\ns\ns\n \nr\na\nt\ni\no\ns\n \na\nn\nd\n \nI\nC\nE\nR\ns\nP\na\nz\n-\nA\nr\ne\ns\n \n2\n0\n0\n8\n9\n9\nS\np\na\ni\nn\n,\n \n\u20ac\n,\n \n2\n0\n0\n7\nH\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n-\nc\na\nr\ne\n \ns\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nY\ne\ns\n \n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nM\na\nr\nk\no\nv\n \nm\no\nd\ne\nl\nH\nu\ns\ne\n \n2\n0\n0\n7\n9\n7\nU\nS\nA\n,\n \nU\nS\n$\n,\n \n2\n0\n0\n5\nS\no\nc\ni\ne\nt\na\nl\n \np\ne\nr\ns\np\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \n(\np\na\ny\ne\nr\ns\n \nf\no\nr\n \nh\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n \nc\na\nr\ne\n)\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nN\nA\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nC\nE\nA\nT\ne\ni\nc\nh\n \n2\n0\n0\n9\n1\n0\n0\nB\nr\na\nz\ni\nl\n,\n \nB\nr\na\nz\ni\nl\ni\na\nn\n \n$\n \n(\nR\n$\n)\n,\n \n2\n0\n0\n5\nb\nH\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n-\nc\na\nr\ne\n \ns\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nY\ne\ns\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nM\na\nr\nk\no\nv\n \nm\no\nd\ne\nl\nW\ni\nl\ns\no\nn\n \n2\n0\n0\n5\n5\n5\nU\nK\n,\n \nG\nB\n\u00a3\n,\n \n(\n2\n0\n0\n4\n?\n)\nH\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n-\nc\na\nr\ne\n \ns\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nY\ne\ns\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\n\uf0fc\nM\na\nr\nk\no\nv\n \nm\no\nd\ne\nl\nB\nC\nC\nA\n,\n \nB\nr\ni\nt\ni\ns\nh\n \nC\no\nl\nu\nm\nb\ni\na\n \nC\na\nn\nc\ne\nr\n \nA\ng\ne\nn\nc\ny\n;\n \nI\nC\nE\nR\n,\n \ni\nn\nc\nr\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nl\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n-\ne\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\nn\ne\ns\ns\n \nr\na\nt\ni\no\n;\n \nP\nF\nM\n,\n \np\nr\no\ng\nr\ne\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\n-\nf\nr\ne\ne\n \nm\no\nn\nt\nh\n;\n \nP\nP\nP\n,\n \np\nu\nr\nc\nh\na\ns\ni\nn\ng\n \np\no\nw\ne\nr\n \np\na\nr\ni\nt\ny\n;\n \nQ\nA\nL\nY\n,\n \nq\nu\na\nl\ni\nt\ny\n-\na\nd\nj\nu\ns\nt\ne\nd\n \nl\ni\nf\ne\n-\ny\ne\na\nr\n.\na\n \n1\n \nU\nS\n$\n \n=\n \n1\n1\n \nM\ne\nx\ni\nc\na\nn\n \np\ne\ns\no\ns\n.\nb\n \nU\nS\n$\n \na\nt\n \nP\nP\nP\n,\n \n1\n \nU\nS\n$\n \n=\n \n1\n.\n4\n \nR\n$\n.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

Paz-Ares et al.99 specified a dose of 50 mg\/day for the patients in the sunitinib \ngroup. The patients in the sunitinib group were provided with BSC. Therefore, this study \ncompared sunitinib plus BSC with BSC alone. BSC in this study included diagnostic tests and \nroutine palliative treatment.99\nThe definition of BSC in the economic evaluation studies was not the same across the studies. \nChabot et al.95 did not clearly define what BSC included, while Contreras-Hernandez et al.96 \ndefined clearly that BSC included treatment with imatinib. Paz-Ares et al.99 defined BSC \nas essentially consisting of diagnostic tests and routine palliative care. In the other three \nstudies,55,97,98 the control group of patients, who are considered as effectively being treated with \nBSC, were not provided with treatment with imatinib. As a full-text paper of the study by Teich et \nal.100 was not available, information on how this study defined BSC was not available.\nAll treatments\nWe did not find any studies that conducted an economic evaluation of all of the alternative \ntreatments (e.g. escalated doses of imatinib 600 mg\/day or imatinib 800 mg\/day, sunitinib and \nBSC) for patients who failed on imatinib at a dose of 400 mg\/day.\nStudy design\nAmong the seven studies that conducted a full economic evaluation, five used Markov \nmodelling.55,95,96,99,100 Huse et al.97 used a very simple modelling framework and Mabasa et al.98 also \nused patient-level data and had 46 and 47 patients in their imatinib and BSC (historical group) \ngroups, respectively. Contreras-Hernandez et al.96 also used patient-level data (for 21 patients) \ncollected at the Hospital de Oncolog\u00eda to estimate the costs of care associated with imatinib, BSC \nand other procedures, and used these costs in their model.\nPerspective\nThree studies55,99,100 adopted the perspective of a national health-care system. The study by \nContreras-Hernandez et al.96 was from Mexico\u2019s health insurance system\u2019s perspective. The study \nby Huse et al.97 did not specifically mention whether it was from a health insurance system \nperspective; however, it mentioned that it had been conducted from a US societal perspective. \nThe studies by Chabot et al.95 and Mabasa et al.98 considered a provincial health authority and \na specialised agency (British Columbia Cancer Agency) perspective, respectively, for their \neconomic evaluations. None of the seven studies55,95\u2013100 that conducted full economic evaluations \nreported indirect non-medical resource use, or indirect costs to society in terms of productivity \nloss, costs to carers, and other indirect costs associated with GIST.\nHealth outcome measures\nThe major outcome measures used in the seven studies reporting full economic evaluations were \nPFS,95,96,98\u2013100 OS,95,98 life-years gained95,96,98\u2013100 and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).55,95,97,99 \nFour studies55,95,97,99 reported the incremental cost per QALY gained. The remaining three \nstudies96,98,100 used incremental cost per life-year gained, and incremental cost per progression-\nfree life-year gained.\nData sources\nMost of the studies,95,96,99 which were based on modelling exercises, used effectiveness or health \noutcome data from major trials38,52,102\u2013104 and adapted them for their specific contexts. The sources \nof cost data were mainly from relevant patients\u2019 records, and health-care cost databases. Wilson \net al.55 used data from an industry submission (Novartis trial). Table 13 summarises the data \nsources used for the studies. A full paper of the study by Teich et al.100 was not available and so \ninformation on the data sources used was unknown.36 Assessment of cost-effectiveness\nTime horizon\nThe studies that used models in their economic evaluations used different time horizons and \ntreatment cycle lengths for the Markov model. The two studies95,99 that had sunitinib and BSC as \ncomparator treatments used a time horizon of 6 years and a treatment cycle length of 6 weeks in \nthe modelling exercise. Of the other studies, the study by Contreras-Hernandez et al.,96 which \nhad sunitinib as a comparator along with imatinib and BSC, used a lifetime time horizon and \nalso a 6-week cycle of treatment (to be consistent with the sunitinib treatment cycle of 6 weeks). \nHuse et al.97 used a 10-year time horizon for the analysis, while Teich et al.100 used a 6-year time \nhorizon, and a 6-week treatment cycle.\nDiscount rate\nA 5% discount rate for costs and health outcomes was used in two studies.95,96 Wilson et al.55 in \ntheir model discounted costs by 6% and QALYs by 1.5%, as per NICE methods guidance at the \ntime the work was conducted. Paz-Ares et al.99 and Huse et al.97 used 3% and 3.5%, respectively. \nMabasa et al.98 used 3% for discounting costs and outcomes. The abstract by Teich et al.100 did not \nreport the discount rate used in their modelling exercise.\nFindings on costs and cost-effectiveness\nThe cost of treatment and cost per different health outcome under different alternatives are \npresented in Table 14. As regards cost in relation to the health outcomes, the incremental cost-\neffectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the studies are noted in the table with respect to the main \nTABLE 13  Data sources\nStudy Unit costs Resource use for treatment Effective\/health outcomes\nChabot 200895 Published literature and Canadian government \nbenefit schedule and medical oncologist\nPublished literature and \nCanadian government \nbenefit schedule and medical \noncologist\nPhase III trial NCT0007521852\nContreras-\nHernandez \n200896\nHospital records (Hospital de Oncolog\u00eda) \nfor 21 patients in Mexico, IMSS pricing \nand reimbursement procedure, and cost of \nsunitinib from Pfizer Laboratories\nPatients\u2019 medical charts, \nassociated information from \nIMSS (Mexican insurance \nsystem)\nPhase III trial52,104\nMabasa 200898 BCCA BCCA registry Patients\u2019 data in two arms (imatinib \ngroups and 46 non-imatinib group) were \ncompared with Demetri 200238 and \nVerweij 2003102\nPaz-Ares 200899 Health costs database eSalud (for \nadministration, radiotherapy, nephrectomy \nand monitoring costs).

The mean number of PFMs was found to be \n5.64 for sunitinib, while it was 5.28 and 2.58, respectively, for imatinib and BSC.

Their study suggested that sunitinib increased life-years and progression-free life-years \nby 0.3 and 0.26, respectively, with an incremental cost of R$86,756 (Brazilian dollars) [US$61,968 \npurchasing power parity (PPP) 2005] in comparison with BSC. They found that sunitinib was \nboth more effective showing a gain in life-years of 0.02 and progression-free life-years of 0.47, \nand less costly than imatinib over 6 years.\nAssessment of uncertainty\nAll six full-text studies55,95\u201399 used some form of sensitivity analysis. Chabot et al.95 varied the \nmost influential model parameters, i.e. utility of progression and no progression, OS (HR), PFS, \npositron emission tomography (PET) at initiation of sunitinib treatment, the cost of palliative \ncare and the cost of PET. The model assumed the acquisition cost of sunitinib was certain and \ndid not vary this in the sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the results of \nthe economic evaluation were most sensitive to the health-state utility value and rate of OS and \nPFS. The sensitivity analysis also suggested that the results were robust. Contreras-Hernandez \net al.96 conducted probabilistic sensitivity analysis with data obtained from the Markov model. \nAn acceptability curve was derived and reported the cost-effectiveness ratios for sunitinib in \ncomparison with palliative care. In the absence of any threshold for cancer therapy in Mexico, \nthey used three hypothetical re-imbursement cut-points equivalent to US$27,723, US$36,364 \nand US$45,455 to derive acceptability curves. These hypothetical values were based on taking \n5%, 14% and 40% of the upper threshold that NICE reimburses for imatinib as first-line \ntreatment. Mabasa et al.98 varied the median OS rate, the rate of PFS and years of life expectancy, \nand conducted univariate sensitivity analysis. They found that the model used for the analysis \nremained robust. The ICER for each median life-year gained was found to be within the range \nof C$0\u2013550 (Canadian dollars), and for each median progression-free year it ranged from C$0 \nto C$75,505. Paz-Ares et al.99 also conducted univariate sensitivity analysis. Their model results \nwere calculated in a probabilistic analysis considering the impact of uncertainty on the values \nof each variable included in the model, by assuming different distributions of these variables. \nThe study conducted sensitivity analysis of the results by adding the cost of imatinib to the BSC \ngroup, by assuming all patients in the palliative care group would be given imatinib 400 mg\/day. \nThe most sensitive variables affecting the results were efficacy of treatment, and the unit cost of \nsunitinib. The study by Huse et al.97 also used univariate sensitivity analysis and examined the \nimpact of considering the upper and lower values of the cost of the drugs, the cost of treatment, \nthe utilities of successful treatment and PD, the time horizon and the annual rate of discount in \ntheir analysis. They used imatinib at a 600 mg\/day dose to examine the impact of results variation \nas an alternative scenario for the sensitivity analysis. The study by Wilson et al.55 fitted a Weibull \ncurve to estimate progression and death due to GIST in their sensitivity analysis and found that \nthe ICER, based on a Weibull curve, was \u00a326,427, and with an exponential fitting was \u00a321,707.\nSummary of the review\nWe found that most of the economic evaluation studies reviewed used a modelling exercise. \nHowever, only two studies96,100 compared both imatinib and sunitinib with BSC for patients who \nhad failed or become resistant to imatinib 400 mg\/day. The full paper for only one of these96 was \navailable. Among the five studies55,95,96,99,100 that used modelling exercises, Contreras-Hernandez \net al.96 and Teich et al.100 did not use QALYs as health outcome measures. Although Contreras-\nHernandez et al.96 used patient-level data as the basis of their cost estimates, they used survival \nand PFS as effectiveness measures in their model, which was based on the studies by Motzer et \nal.104 and Demetri et al.52\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\n39   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\nThe two studies95,99 that used modelling exercises to compare the cost-effectiveness of sunitinib \nonly with BSC used the same trial data (A6181004).52 Their utility data were based on responses \nto the EQ-5D instrument provided by participants in this trial.\nIn our review we did not identify any published economic evaluation studies in a UK context \ncomparing all the relevant interventions. The study that included an economic evaluation of \nhigher dose imatinib in a UK context55 did not actually have as a comparator those who failed \nwith imatinib 400 mg\/day; rather the model allowed patients who failed on 400 mg\/day to cross \nover to a higher dose of imatinib 600 mg\/day rather than 800 mg\/day.\nThe definition of BSC in the economic evaluation studies reviewed was not the same across \nthe studies and cost-effectiveness of treatments compared with that of BSC cannot be easily \ncompared. In addition, the pattern of resources used including the drugs for treatment was \nreported in different ways in different studies.\nFor a comprehensive economic evaluation of the alternative treatments for GIST patients who \nfail on or become resistant to imatinib 400 mg\/day, further evidence is needed to fill in gaps in \nthe evidence base. The challenge is to obtain appropriate and sufficient information on survival \nrates and responses to treatments with escalated doses of imatinib, and sunitinib. The economic \nevaluations which were identified based on modelling exercises have limitations. For example, all \nextrapolated clinical trial data from a short time horizon were used to predict cost-effectiveness \nresults for a longer period. There is a need for empirical patient-level data for future economic \nevaluations. The outcome measures for disease severity can be considered as important surrogate \nend points. In cases where the patients in placebo groups or in BSC arms of trials are allowed \nto cross over to an experimental group (either escalated doses of imatinib or sunitinib) it \ncould be argued that an intention to treat analysis would result in an underestimation of the \nsurvival benefit of patients randomised in the treatment groups, and the cost of the treatment \nfor these patients who were assigned to placebo\/BSC groups is often not accounted for in \neconomic evaluations.\nThere has been no consideration of the patients\u2019 and society\u2019s costs\/resource use in the studies \nreviewed. A wider perspective might be informative. However, NICE\u2019s guidance94 suggests that \ncosts and resources falling to the NHS and Personal Social Services (PSS) should be used. This \napproach by NICE is not universally accepted and costs and benefits falling on other groups may \nbe relevant, for example in helping to illustrate additional choices and trade-offs that a decision-\nmaker may wish to consider.\nEconomic modelling\nModel structure\nThe structure of the model was informed by the modelling studies identified as part of the \nsystematic review of economic evaluations, the review of clinical effectiveness, and other existing \nevidence including previous NICE TARs. We have also drawn upon advice from health-care \nprofessionals within the research team in this regard.\nThe model was developed to compare the alternative treatment strategies for people with KIT \n(CD117)-positive unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs whose disease has progressed on \ntreatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg\/day or those whose treatment with imatinib has \nfailed owing to intolerance. According to the scope for the review the treatment strategies to be \ncompared in the models were:40 Assessment of cost-effectiveness\n1.  treatment with an escalated dose of 600 mg\/day, regulating symptoms with BSC\n2.  treatment with an escalated dose of 800 mg\/day, regulating symptoms with BSC\n3.  treatment with sunitinib (within its recommended dose range), regulating symptoms \nwith BSC\n4.  regulating symptoms with BSC only.\nThe assumed pathway of the model\nWe considered a range of different alternative pathways for patients who progressed on imatinib \nat a dose of 400 mg\/day, which led to the creation of nine alternative pathways, and, following \nadvice from our clinical advisers, we determined seven clinically plausible pathways (Figure 5). \nThe model is based on these seven clinically plausible care pathways. Circles represent health \nstates that individuals may return to, rectangles represent health states during which treatment is \nadministered, and the arrows show the possible directions in which individuals could move at the \nend of each cycle, depending on the transition probabilities. The states considered in the model \nwere those thought to reflect care pathways for people with GIST. Patients entering the pathways \nare those who failed on imatinib 400 mg\/day. The alternative treatments considered were dose \nT1 = imatinib 600 mg\/day, T2 = imatinib 800 mg\/day, T3 = sunitinib (with recommended dose \n50 mg\/day) and BSC.\nA Markov model was developed to model these care pathways using Treeage Pro 2009 (TreeAge \nSoftware Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA). In this model, patients whose disease has progressed \non treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg\/day or those whose treatment with imatinib \nhas failed owing to intolerance enter one of the seven care pathways. Figure 6 is an illustrative \nexample of the model structure for Path-4, where patients are treated with imatinib 600 mg\/day, \nand if the disease progresses on this treatment the patients are treated with BSC. Appendix 12 \nillustrates the model for all seven pathways of alternative treatments.\nPath-1 shows the patients with BSC treatment. It is assumed that the patients with BSC are still \ntreated with imatinib and palliative care. Path-2 represents treatment options where escalated \ndoses of imatinib (600 and 800 mg\/day) and treatment with sunitinib are provided to the cohort \nof patients. All patients start the treatment with imatinib 600 mg\/day. If they survive and respond \nto imatinib 600 mg\/day then they will continue with the dose until they move to a state of stable \ncondition with complete response or PR (CR\/Stable IM 600). From this point, a proportion \nof patients will survive and continue to respond to treatment. Those who stop responding to \nimatinib 600 mg\/day move to a state where they receive imatinib 800 mg\/day (PD at IM 600). A \nproportion of patients will remain with the escalated dose of imatinib 800 mg daily (CR\/Stable \nIM 800). If patients fail to respond on imatinib 800 mg daily, they are switched to treatment \nwith sunitinib (PD with sunitinib). If they respond to sunitinib then they will continue with the \ntreatment and move to a state of stable condition with complete response or PR (CR\/Stable with \nsunitinib). From this point, a proportion of patients may continue to respond to the treatment \nand remain stable, or they may stop responding to sunitinib and receive BSC for the remainder of \ntheir life.\nPath-3 represents treatment options through which an escalated dose of imatinib (imatinib \n600 mg\/day only) and treatment with sunitinib are provided. In this pathway, all patients also \nstart the treatment with imatinib 600 mg\/day (PD initial treatment IM 600). If they respond to \nimatinib 600 mg\/day then they will continue with the dose and move to a state of stable condition \nwith complete response or PR (CR\/Stable IM 600). If a patient treated with imatinib 600 mg\/day \nfails to respond, or ceases to respond, then instead of trying further dose escalation with imatinib \nthey are switched to treatment with sunitinib (PD with sunitinib). If they respond to sunitinib \nthey will continue with the treatment and move to a state of stable condition with complete \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

Should they fail to respond to sunitinib or if at some \npoint they cease to respond they continue with BSC for the remainder of their life.\nIn Path-4, all patients start the treatment with imatinib 600 mg\/day and no switching to other \ntreatments is considered. If they respond to imatinib 600 mg\/day then they continue with this \ntreatment until the GIST progresses or they die (CR\/Stable IM 600). If at any point they do not \nrespond to imatinib 600 mg\/day they continue with BSC for the remainder of their life. This \noption has been considered as a treatment option in the model, although actual clinical practice \nmay favour further escalation to 800 mg\/day. Nevertheless, for this model, care pathways were \ndeveloped with clinical advice on plausible pathways of care, some of which may be more typical \nof current practice than others.\nThe remaining care pathways are variants of earlier pathways. Path-5 is similar to Path-3 with \nrespect to the combination of escalated dose of imatinib and sunitinib, the main difference in this \ncase is that the escalated dose is imatinib 800 mg\/day. Apart from this difference the pathways \nare identical. Path-6 is similar to Path-4. However, in this pathway the escalated dose is imatinib \n800 mg\/day instead of imatinib 600 mg\/day. Path-7 is similar to Path-4. In this pathway, however, \ninstead of being treated with imatinib 600 mg\/day, patients receive sunitinib. Apart from this \nchange, the care pathways are identical (see Appendix 12).\nThe care pathways chosen for our model are not exhaustive and do not include every single \npossible clinical intervention available to oncologists treating GIST after failure at 400 mg\/day \nof imatinib, but the care pathways chosen reflect the scope of this research as agreed with NICE. \nOther possible treatments (e.g. surgery for those whose tumours become resectable following \ntreatment with escalated doses of imatinib) were not considered.\nKey assumptions of the modelling exercise\nThe key assumptions of the model are:\n1.  The time horizon of the model is 10 years, over which time all patients are expected to die, \nand the cycle length is 1 month.\n2.  The model assumes that patients entering a pathway will remain in a health state and on \nthe treatment for one cycle only. If they respond and remain stable they continue on the \ntreatment in the next cycle. If they do not respond but survive in the treatment arm they \nare considered to move to an escalated dose, move to another alternative (if allowed by a \ntreatment pathway) or continue with BSC for the remaining time horizon of the model.\n3.  The model assumes that the probabilities of progressing and dying do not change over time. \nThis assumption was made because of the limited data available.\n4.  The utilities of the health outcome from treatment with imatinib 600 mg\/day, imatinib \n800 mg\/day and sunitinib are assumed to be the same. This assumption was made because of \nthe limited data available.\nFIGURE 6  Example of model structure for care pathway Path-4 (imatinib 600 mg\/day \u2013 BSC).\nImatinib\n(600 mg\/day)\nStable on imatinib\n(600 mg\/day)\nDeath Progressive disease\n(best supportive care) \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\n43   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\n5.  All patients failing or not responding to the treatment in any of the treatment arms of the \nmodel continue with BSC for the remainder of the model time horizon or until they die, and \nare assumed to derive the same utility as from the health state of progression. Owing to lack \nof data, time-dependent changes in transition rates of response were not built into the model.\nData requirements and model inputs\nFor our model, data on the clinical effectiveness of interventions were based upon the systematic \nreview of clinical effectiveness described earlier. These data were combined within the model \nwith health-state utilities data to provide estimates of QALYs for the alternative treatment \nstrategies for patients with GIST.\nWith respect to clinical effectiveness, data were required for the model on the probability of death \nper cycle and the probability of not responding to treatment per cycle.\nProbability of death\nAs described in the systematic review of effectiveness few data were available for any of the \ntreatments, few of which were based on direct comparisons. Therefore, the data available are \nimprecise and potentially biased. The direction and magnitude of any bias is unknown. As a \nconsequence the data used to derive probabilities of death for each therapy under consideration \nshould be treated cautiously.\nProbability of death for BSC\nThe data for BSC were taken from two studies106,107 and a pooled weighted estimate suggested \nthat 87.9% (51\/58) died during the observation period of 60 months. A monthly rate was derived \nusing an exponential function which assumes the probability of death per month is constant over \ntime. The same value was used in circumstances where patients moved on to BSC after previously \nbeing treated with imatinib at an escalated dose or with sunitinib. The data from the review of \nclinical effectiveness were not appropriate to populate the BSC states in the model, as no BSC \nstudies met the inclusion criteria. The second best source of data would have been information \non follow-up of non-crossover patients following failure at 400 mg\/day, but these patients were \nnot followed up in any of the included studies looking at dose escalation of imatinib. The only \nother data available on BSC come from the pre-imatinib era (where it would not have been \npossible for people to have failed on 400 mg\/day of imatinib). The two sources chosen from \nthe studies identified (see Appendix 13) were chosen because they had larger sample sizes and \nlonger median follow-up times. However, one of the sources relates to a study conducted before \nthere was awareness of GIST as being a distinct tumour. Alternative data for this parameter are \noutlined in Appendix 13; however, it is likely that these data would provide similar, imprecise and \npotentially biased estimates for this probability.\nProbability of death for imatinib at 600 and 800 mg\/day\nThe data on mortality for the imatinib 600 mg\/day treatment groups were taken from the \navailable trial data39 and 55% (6\/11) of those who crossed over to imatinib 600 mg\/day died \nover the trial period of 60 months. Although the sample size is very small, in the absence of any \nbetter alternative it has been used in the model. The data on mortality for imatinib 800 mg\/day \nwere taken from Blanke et al.41 [where the data suggest that 64.41% (76\/118) died in the imatinib \n800 mg\/day group]. Again the monthly mortality rate was derived as an exponential rate. It \nshould be noted that the study was not designed to assess dose escalation, and the use of data \nfrom the crossover groups from the studies used are not ideal estimates for probability of death \nfor these patients. In the absence of other suitable data we have used these data for our model.44 Assessment of cost-effectiveness\nProbability of death for sunitinib\nThe mortality data for those treated with sunitinib came from Reichardt et al.81 In this study \n231\/331 patients receiving sunitinib survived. The monthly mortality rate was derived assuming \nan exponential rate. In the analysis it was also assumed that the mortality rate for those receiving \nsunitinib was the same regardless of any possible differences in prior treatment. It should also \nbe noted that the survival estimate from this trial was based on those who failed on imatinib at \ndoses of \u2264 400 mg\/day, but it is not clear whether the patients failed on the 400 mg\/day dose or at \nlower doses.\nResponse rates for the treatments\nFor our model, response to treatment was also taken to include PR, complete response and those \nreported to be in a stable condition.\nThe response rate for imatinib 600 mg\/day was based upon data from the B2222 trial.39 This study \nreported that 25.5% (11\/43) of patients had responded and remained stable during a median \nfollow-up of 63 months. The sample size of this study was small, but these were the only data \navailable for the specific population of interest. It should be noted that the B2222 trial39 was not \ndesigned to assess dose escalation and there was no randomisation of patients at the point of \ndisease progression.\nThe S003341 and EORTC44 trials data were used to provide evidence of the response rate for \nimatinib 800 mg\/day. These studies reported that 30% (75\/250) of patients responded to \ntreatment with imatinib 800 mg\/day and showed PR or stable condition after a median follow-up \nof 54 months.\nFor sunitinib none of the studies meeting the inclusion criteria for the review of effectiveness \nreported data on response rate. Therefore, this parameter was estimated from the weighted \naverage response rate from two studies reporting this outcome.38,108 In these two studies in total \n266\/382 patients responded, and a simple weighted mean was used to derive the pooled response \nrate. This response rate was assumed to be unaffected by prior treatment received. It should be \nnoted that the patient groups in these two studies may not be the same. The Prior et al. study108 \ndoes not report the previous imatinib dose for participants, whereas in Demetri et al.38 most of \nthe population failed on 800 mg\/day imatinib. As there was no statistically significant difference \nin the response rates, we took these two studies as a second-best source. The non-response \ndata for each treatment were converted into monthly transition probabilities by assuming an \nexponential function.\nCost data\nResources used by the selected treatment strategies were identified from relevant sources [e.g. \nNHS reference costs, the British National Formulary (BNF), etc.] and the review of economic \nevaluations. Costs have been considered from a NHS perspective only. An identification of the \npotential direct and indirect resource costs for the NHS and PSS that would be expected from the \nintroduction of the technology is presented.\nWe included the costs of drugs, i.e. costs of imatinib 400 mg\/day, 600 mg\/day, 800 mg\/day and \nsunitinib 50 mg\/day. As the sunitinib treatment process involved taking medication for 4 weeks \nand then no medication for the following 2 weeks, we estimated the yearly medication costs of \nthis drug and then equally proportioned this cost to each month within that year. Data on cost \nof drugs were obtained from the BNF no. 58.109 It has been assumed that patients on BSC still \nreceive medications and it has been assumed that the cost of these is equivalent to the cost of \nimatinib at 400 mg\/day.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\n45   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\nResource use by the treatments was based on the study by Wilson et al.,55 which suggested \nthat there are GP visits (\u00a340 per year), outpatient visits including tests (\u00a3440 per year) and CT \nscans (\u00a3656 per year) and cost of management of adverse events (\u00a3159 per year), at 2004 prices. \nThese cost estimates were used for our model after adjusting for inflation with the Hospital and \nCommunity Health Services (HCHS) Index for pay and prices inflation for the year 2008\u20139.110 \nBased on these estimates, the total monthly cost of management with imatinib treatment is \n\u00a3128.16. These other treatment costs represent approximately 5% of the total cost of the drug \nitself. In the absence of better data these costs have been used for imatinib at both 600 and \n800 mg\/day.\nFor the sunitinib group we have used the resources based on the Pfizer single technology \nassessment submission60 for patient monitoring, outpatient and GP visits (\u00a3799.73 per year), CT \nimaging (\u00a3336 for 7.3 months) and management of adverse events (\u00a3159 per year). These costs \nare at 2008 prices and were adjusted to 2009 prices using the same methods as described above. \nBased on these data the estimated total monthly cost of this care used within the model is \u00a3185.\nFor BSC, data from the Pfizer submission were again used:60 the suggested costs in 2008 prices \nfor patient monitoring, outpatient and GP visits were \u00a3249 per year, and \u00a3105 per year for CT \nimaging. These costs were inflated to 2009 prices using the same methods described above.\nThe different estimates for the costs of CT scanning between the two drugs can be accounted for \nby the fact that different sources were used to derive the costs of CT scanning. When inflated to \n2008\u20139 prices, this gave the monthly cost of CT scans as \u00a315.01 for BSC groups, \u00a364.92 for the \nimatinib groups and \u00a348.04 for the sunitinib groups.51,55\nThe monthly cost of adverse events in the model is \u00a313.25 for the imatinib groups (600 and \n800 mg\/day) and \u00a321.78 for sunitinib, which is about 10% of all other costs for imatinib and 12% \nof all other costs for sunitinib. There were insufficient data on disutility to incorporate this as a \nparameter within the model, despite evidence to suggest differences in the adverse event profiles \nof imatinib and sunitinib that could influence disutility.111\nUtility data\nThere were few data relating to health-state utilities. Our model has used data in which the \nhealth-state valuations are derived from the EQ-5D, and the values used were taken from Wilson \net al.55 and Chabot et al.95 The utility associated with PFS for those responding to imatinib \n(regardless of dose) was 0.935.55 The utility for those receiving BSC was taken from Chabot et al.95 \nand was taken to be 0.577. In the absence of alternative data it has been assumed that the \nutility for those who have not progressed on sunitinib is the same as that assumed for imatinib, \ni.e. 0.935.\nTable 15 describes the parameter inputs used within the model. It also describes the sources \nof data, alternative valuations and data used to inform the probabilistic sensitivity analysis \n(described in more detail below).\nIn a sensitivity analysis, the high value of the costs of drugs (imatinib and sunitinib) has been \nassumed to be similar to the value based on the BNF price,109 which we used in our model for \nthe base-case analysis. For the lower value, we have taken an average of the price of the higher \nand lower doses assuming that there may be a need to lower the dose in the treatment pathways \nassumed in our model. For sunitinib, during the sensitivity analysis the price of the lower dose \nis assumed.46 Assessment of cost-effectiveness\nTABLE 15  Model parameters, values and data sources\nParameters Description Value\nFor sensitivity \nanalysis\nDistribution Values\nData source and \nassumptions Low High\nCost parameters (\u00a3)\ncImat600 Cost of drugs: imatinib 600 2406 2005 2406 BNF 58:109 low value \nis average of imatinib \n400 and 600 mg\ncImat800 Cost of drugs:\nimatinib 800\n3208 2807 3208 BNF 58:109 low value \nis average of imatinib \n600 and 800 mg\nCNott Cost of\nBSC\n1604 1283 1604 Includes cost of \nimatinib 400 mg \n(BNF 58109)\nCSunb Cost of drugs: sunitinib 3138.8 2092.5 3138.8 BNF 58:109 low value \nis average of reduced \ndose of sunitinib \nOthCostBSC Other costs and management \nof treatment in BSC arm\n50.61 Resource use in the \ntreatment was based \non the study by Wilson \n200555\nOthCostIm Other costs and management \nof treatment in imatinib \ntreatment arm\n128.16 Resource use in the \ntreatment was based \non the study by Wilson \n2005.55 Assumed to \nbe same for imatinib \n600 and imatinib 800\nOthCostSun Other costs and management \nof treatment in sunitinib \ntreatment arm\n185.11 Resource use in the \ntreatment was based \non the study by Wilson \n200555 and single \ntechnology appraisal \nof Pfizer60\nMortality and response to treatment\ndeathBSC Probability of death in the \nBSC treatment arm\n0.014627 Beta \u03b1 = 0.8448898\n\u03b2 = 57.775\nPooled weighted \nrate106,107\ndth600 Probability of death in \nimatinib 600 treatment arm\n0.007472 Beta \u03b1 = 0.08162\n\u03b2 = 10.91838\nB2222 study39\ndth800 Probability of death in \nimatinib 800 treatment arm\n0.011857 Beta \u03b1 = 1.39948\n\u03b2 = 116.600\nS0033 study41\nDthsun Death due to GIST: sunitinib 0.026706 Beta \u03b1 = 9.3284\n\u03b2 = 341.62\nReichardt 200881\nnonrespIm600 Transition probability of non-\nresponse to imatinib 600\n0.011743 Beta \u03b1 = 0.504949\n\u03b2 = 42.495051\nB2222 study39\nnonrespIm800 Transition probability of non-\nresponse to imatinib 800\n0.012879 Beta \u03b1 = 3.21875\n\u03b2 = 246.780\nS0033 study41 and \nZalcberg 200544\nnonrespSun Transition probability of non-\nresponse to sunitinib\n0.080959 Beta \u03b1 = 12.30\n\u03b2 = 139.6945\nWeighted average \nresponse rate52,108\nuImat600 Utility with imatinib 600 0.935 0.712 0.939 Wilson 200555\nuImat800 Utility with imatinib 800 0.935 0.712 0.939 Wilson 200555\nuProg Utility for PD 0.577 0.52 0.712 Chabot 200895 and \nWilson 200555 for \nlower level values for \nsensitivity analysis\nuSun Utility with sunitinib treatment 0.935 0.712 0.939 Chabot 200895\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

As reported \nearlier the typical survival of such patients is relatively short and hence the time horizon of the \nmodel was limited to 10 years. The cycle length was 1 month to reflect the natural history of \nthe condition.\nAnalysis methods\nThe results of the model are presented in terms of the incremental cost per QALY. The costs and \noutcomes were discounted at 3.5% in accordance with NICE guidelines. As described below, both \ndeterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted with a net benefit framework \nbeing used to compare the different treatment strategies.\nSensitivity analysis\nProbabilistic sensitivity analyses\nProbabilistic sensitivity analyses of the base-case scenario were conducted by assuming a beta \ndistribution of the probability of death and non-response to treatment in the different treatment \nstrategies. The values used to define these distributions are reported in Table 15 and are derived \nfrom the data reported in Data requirements and model inputs, above.\nThe beta distribution as defined above might arguably be considered to be too precise and to \nnot truly reflect the degree of uncertainty that exists. To examine the uncertainties around the \ndistribution assumed for the base-case scenario, sensitivity analysis was conducted by assigning \na uniform distribution to these parameters, where the low and high value of probability of death \nand non-response rate were assumed to be 90% less than and 90% more than the mean value \nused in our model, respectively. The justification for this distribution was that comparisons of \ninterventions that are based on non-randomised and non-comparative data are potentially biased \nand that both the magnitude and direction of bias are uncertain.\nDeterministic sensitivity analyses\nSensitivity analysis was conducted with respect to methodological and structural assumptions. \nFirst, the discount rate for costs and effectiveness was changed to 0% and 6% in the sensitivity \nanalysis. The time horizon was also varied between 6 and 12 years (data are presented in the \nresults for 6- and 12-year time horizons).\nSensitivity analysis was also conducted to examine the uncertainties around the values used for \nthe cost of drugs (which are major components of the cost of treatment for different treatment \nParameters Description Value\nFor sensitivity \nanalysis\nDistribution Values\nData source and \nassumptions Low High\nStructural and methodological parameters\nCycle length Time period that utilities, \ncosts and probabilities \nrelate to\n1 month  Assumption\nLength of run No. of cycles model is run for 120 (10 \nyears)\n72 (6 \nyears)\n144 (12 \nyears)\nAssumption\nDR Discount rate  0.002917 0 0.005 NICE guideline94\nTABLE 15  Model parameters, values and data sources (continued)48 Assessment of cost-effectiveness\nstrategies) and the utility values for the different health states of the model. The values used in the \nsensitivity analysis are reported in Table 15.\nA further area of uncertainty relates to the very limited data available for imatinib 600 mg\/day. \nIn the base-case analysis the effectiveness (in terms of survival and response rates) is better for \nimatinib 600 mg\/day than with imatinib at 800 mg\/day. As this was based on non-randomised, \nnon-comparative data the relative difference is potentially biased. Therefore, in this sensitivity \nanalysis a more conservative assumption was taken that the survival rate and the response rate for \ntreatment with imatinib 800 mg\/day also applied to imatinib 600 mg\/day.\nResults\nBase-case analysis\nTable 16 shows the mean estimates of cost and effectiveness of the seven alternative treatment \nstrategies modelled. As this table shows, effectiveness has been reported in two ways: life-years \nand QALYs. Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day has an incremental cost per QALY that is < \u00a330,000 \ncompared with Path-1, BSC. The only other non-dominated or non-extendedly dominated \nstrategy is Path-2, imatinib 600 to imatinib 800 mg\/day to sunitinib. However, in this case the \nincremental cost per QALY (compared with the next most costly option of Path-4, imatinib \n600 mg\/day) is in excess of \u00a340,000.\nOf note is that in the base-case analysis treatment with sunitinib for those who failed with \nimatinib 400 mg\/day (Path-7) was estimated to have a lower life expectancy than BSC but \ngreater QALYs. The reason for this was that the estimates of survival for sunitinib were based \nupon limited non-randomised and non-comparative data (as was the case for all the other \ncomparators). Hence, any comparison should be treated cautiously.\nThe finding that sunitinib was dominated by BSC when effectiveness was measured in life-years \nbut not dominated when effectiveness was measured in QALYs illustrates the importance of \nTABLE 16  Base-case analysis and incremental cost\u2013utility of the alternative treatment pathways\nStrategies  Cost (\u00a3)\nIncremental \ncost (\u00a3) Life-years\nIncremental \nlife-years QALYs\nIncremental \nQALYs\nIncremental cost \nper QALY (\u00a3)\nPath-1 BSC 92,811 4.154 2.397\nPath-7 Sunitinib 96,688 3877 3.716 (Dominated) 2.411 0.014 272,365\nPath-4 Imatinib \n600 mg\n147,060 50,372 5.211 1.057 4.256 1.845 27,304\nPath-3 Imatinib \n600 mg to sunitinib\n149,200 2139 5.032 Dominated 4.286 0.030 71,723\nPath 6 Imatinib \n800 mg\n153,901 4702 4.506 Dominated 3.635 \u20130.651 Dominated\nPath-5 Imatinib \n800 mg to sunitinib\n155,828 6628 4.336 Dominated 3.659 \u20130.627 Dominated\nPath-2 Imatinib \n600 mg to 800 mg to \nsunitinib\n172,152 22,953 5.278 0.067 4.803 0.517 44,359\nWith dominated and extendedly dominated options removed\nPath-1 BSC 92,811 4.154 2.397\nPath-4 Imatinib \n600 mg\n147,060 54,249 5.211 1.057 4.256 1.859 29,181\nPath-2 Imatinib \n600 mg to 800 mg to \nsunitinib\n172,152 25,092 5.278 0.067 4.803 0.547 45,850\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

Again, such data were sparse and, particularly \nfor sunitinib, do not reflect the potentially worse side effect profile. Other things remaining \nunchanged the inclusion of side effects would have reduced the QALYs obtained from pathways \ncontaining sunitinib and potentially led to Path-7 being dominated by BSC (at the very least the \nincremental cost per QALY would have increased from the \u00a3272,365 reported in Table 16).\nThe results reported in Table 16 are surrounded by considerable imprecision. One of the main \nsources of the imprecision in the analysis surrounds the clinical effectiveness data. Therefore, \na partial probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted, with the imprecision surrounding \nresponse rates and mortality rates being characterised by beta distributions. Figure 7 shows \nthe cost-effectiveness acceptability curve and illustrates that the pathway with the highest \nlikelihood of being considered cost-effective when society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY is \nless than approximately \u00a325,000 is Path-1, BSC. When society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY \nis between approximately \u00a325,000 and \u00a345,000 then Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, is most likely \nto be considered cost-effective. Beyond a threshold of approximately \u00a345,000, Path-2, imatinib \n600 mg\/day to imatinib 800 mg\/day to sunitinib, is most likely to be cost-effective.\nSensitivity analysis\nUncertainty around the distributions used for mortality and response \nrates\nThe beta distributions used to generate Figure 7 potentially do not fully characterise the extent \nof the uncertainty surrounding the estimates of mortality and response used within the model. \nAs noted in the previous section (see Probabilistic sensitivity analyses), this is because the data \nare used essentially as if they came from non-randomised, non-comparative sources, and hence \nany comparisons drawn may be highly biased. For this reason, in this sensitivity analysis uniform \ndistributions were substituted for the beta distributions (Figure 8). It should be noted that these \nuniform distributions were assumed to be symmetrical around the point estimates used in the \nbase-case analysis.\nAs Figure 8 illustrates, the basic pattern of the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve is the same as \nthat depicted in Figure 7. At low threshold values for the willingness to pay for a QALY, Path-1, \nBSC, is still the most likely to be considered cost-effective. However, Path-7, sunitinib, is more \nFIGURE 7  Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for alternative treatments over the 10-year time horizon.

It should be noted that even though the distributions \nsurrounding mortality weights are very wide in this analysis sunitinib is still associated with a \ntrend towards a slightly higher mortality rate than BSC. As previously noted this trend is based \nupon sparse and potentially unreliable data on the performance of sunitinib. At a threshold value \nof approximately \u00a336,000 Path-3, imatinib 600 mg daily to sunitinib, has a similar probability \nof being considered cost-effective as Path-1, BSC, and Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day. Between a \nthreshold of \u00a336,000 and \u00a348,000, Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, is most likely to be cost-effective, \nand beyond that threshold value Path-2, imatinib 600 mg\/day to imatinib 800 mg\/day to \nsunitinib, is most likely to be cost-effective.\nUncertainty surrounding structure and methodological assumptions \naround distribution\nTwo different discount rates have been applied to costs and benefits to examine the sensitivity \nof the results to plausible changes in the discount rate (Table 17). At a 0% discount rate there is \nno change in the options that are dominated or extendedly dominated, and the incremental cost \nper QALY for Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, compared with Path-1, BSC, increases to \u00a331,183. \nThe incremental cost per QALY for Path-2, imatinib 600 mg\/day to 800 mg\/day to sunitinib, \ncompared with Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, increases to \u00a354,715.\nWhen the discount rate is changed to 6%, the incremental cost per QALYs for the non-dominated \nstrategies falls compared with the base-case analysis. The key change is that Path-3, imatinib \n600 mg\/day to sunitinib, is no longer extendedly dominated by Path 4, imatinib 600 mg\/day. \nFurthermore, the incremental cost per QALY for this comparison is < \u00a330,000. Overall, the \nsensitivity analysis around discount rates illustrates that the results are sensitive to the choice of \ndiscount rate.\nTable 18 reports the results of the sensitivity analysis around the time horizon of the model. \nWhen the time horizon is reduced to 6 years (base case = 10 years) the incremental cost \nper QALYs associated with the non-dominated options increases slightly. When the time \nhorizon increases, the incremental cost per QALY for Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, compared \nwith Path-1, BSC, increases slightly.

These data are \n(1) potentially unreliable because they are based upon non-randomised and non-comparative \ndata and (2) potentially counterintuitive (in a direct comparison would we expect imatinib \n800 mg\/day to perform worse than imatinib 600 mg\/day?). Therefore, in this sensitivity analysis \nit was assumed that the mortality and response to treatment with imatinib 600 mg\/day was the \nsame as that with imatinib 800 mg\/day.\nAs Table 19 shows the incremental cost per QALY for Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, compared \nwith Path-1, BSC, falls. This is because there is a reduction in the cost of medications as the \nprobabilities that patients die or make the transition to BSC increases, which more than \ncompensates for the fall in QALYs. The QALYs associated with Path-3, imatinib 600 mg\/day to \nimatinib 800 mg\/day to sunitinib, fall but the incremental cost per QALY compared with Path 4, \nimatinib 600 mg\/day, is virtually unchanged.\nAs noted in Data requirements and model inputs (above), the two sources106,107 of mortality data \nthat we have used for BSC were chosen because these studies had larger sample sizes and longer \nmedian follow-up times (Appendix 13). We conducted sensitivity analysis using different sources \nof mortality data for BSC, i.e. using a pooled mortality estimate of 19.8% that is based on survival \nestimates from Pierie et al.,107 Dougherty et al.112 and Artyan et al.113  The monthly mortality rate \nwould be higher (0.02349) than what we have used in the base case (0.014627). As mortality for \nBSC increases, the cost and QALYs for the pathways fall because BSC is part of each pathway. \nAs a consequence the incremental cost per QALYs do not change greatly although all slightly \nincrease compared with less costly but less effective pathways because the increase in mortality \nfor BSC has proportionately a greater effect on costs than on QALYs.\nUncertainty surrounding utility values\nThe sensitivity of a lower and higher value of utility for the health status of disease progression \nwas examined. In this analysis the lower value was 0.52 and a higher utility value for those \npatients who progressed with GIST of 0.712 was assumed instead of 0.577, as was used in the \nbase case (Table 20). Reducing the utility value increased the QALYs for treatments that had \nhigher probabilities of response. The incremental cost per QALY for Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, \ncompared with Path-1, BSC, slightly falls and the incremental cost per QALY for Path-2, imatinib \n600 mg\/day to imatinib 800 mg\/day to sunitinib, compared with Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, \nfalls to approximately \u00a340,000.\nConversely, increasing the utility associated with PD reduced the opportunity for pathways that \nare clinically more effective to generate additional QALYs. As a consequence, in this sensitivity \nanalysis the incremental cost per QALYs for the non-dominated pathways increase.\nUncertainty surrounding the cost of imatinib and sunitinib\nIn this set of sensitivity analyses reductions in the cost of imatinib 600 mg\/day, imatinib \n800 mg\/day and sunitinib are explored (Table 21). Over most of these sensitivity analyses the \npathways that are dominated or are extendedly dominated do not change. As would be expected \nreducing the costs of each medication individually reduces the cost of pathways involving \nthat medication.

This is primarily because this pathway \nuses potentially unreliable data on mortality for sunitinib which means that patients on this \npathway do not survive long enough to incur higher costs.\nSummary\nThe systematic review of economic evaluations reported in this chapter was not especially \ninformative. This was anticipated at the outset and hence an economic modelling exercise was \nplanned. The modelling exercise compared alternative treatment pathways for patients with \nunresectable GIST who failed to respond to imatinib 400 mg\/day. Over almost all the sensitivity \nanalyses Path-1, BSC, is the least costly and least effective intervention. Similarly, Path-4, imatinib \n600 mg\/day, typically has an incremental cost per QALY that is less than \u00a330,000 compared with \nPath-1, BSC. Path-2 (imatinib 600 mg\/day to imatinib 800 mg\/day to sunitinib) is the only other \npathway which is not dominated or extendedly dominated over most of the analyses conducted. \nHowever, in this case the incremental cost per QALY (compared with the next most costly option \n\u2013 Path-4: imatinib 600 mg\/day) tends to be in excess of \u00a340,000.\nTABLE 21  Sensitivity around the costs of imatinib and sunitinib\nStrategy Cost (\u00a3) QALYs\nIncremental cost per \nQALY (\u00a3)\nBase case:\nImatinib 600 mg \u00a32406\nImatinib 800 mg $3208\nSunitinib \u00a33138.8 \nPath-1 BSC 92,811 2.397\nPath-7 Sunitinib 96,688 2.411 272,365\nPath-4 Imatinib 600 mg 147,060 4.256 27,304\nPath-3 Imatinib 600 mg to sunitinib  149,200 4.286 71,723\nPath-6 Imatinib 800 mg 153,901 3.635 Dominated\nPath-5 Imatinib 800 mg to sunitinib 155,828 3.659 Dominated\nPath-2 Imatinib 600 to 800 mg to sunitinib 172,152 4.803 44,359\nSensitivity analysis 8 (change \nin imatinib 600 mg price):\nImatinib 600 mg \u00a32005\nImatinib 800 mg $3208.16\nSunitinib \u00a33138.8\nPath-1 BSC 92,811 2.397\nPath-7 Sunitinib 96,688 2.411 Extendedly dominated\nPath-4 Imatinib 600 mg 130,272 4.256 20,150\nPath-3 Imatinib 600 mg to sunitinib  132,412 4.286 Extendedly dominated\nPath-6 Imatinib 800 mg 153,901 3.635 Dominated\nPath-2 Imatinib 600 to 800 mg to sunitinib 155,364 4.803 45,850\nPath-5 Imatinib 800 mg to sunitinib 155,828 3.659 Dominated\nSensitivity analysis 9 (change \nin imatinib 800 mg price):\nImatinib 600 mg \u00a32406\nImatinib 800mg $2807\nSunitinib \u00a33138.8\nPath-1 BSC 92,811 2.397\nPath-7 Sunitinib 96,688 2.411 Extendedly dominated\nPath-6 Imatinib 800 mg 139,988 3.635 Extendedly dominated\nPath-5 Imatinib 800 mg to sunitinib 141,915 3.659 Extendedly dominated\nPath-4 Imatinib 600 mg 147,060 4.256 29,181\nPath-3 Imatinib 600 mg to sunitinib  149,200 4.286 Extendedly dominated\nPath-2 Imatinib 600 to 800 mg to sunitinib 166,000 4.803 34,609\nSensitivity analysis 10 (change \nin sunitinib price):\nImatinib 600 mg \u00a32406\nImatinib 800mg $3208.16\nSunitinib \u00a32092\nPath-7 Sunitinib 87,533 2.411\nPath-1 BSC 92,811 2.397 Dominated\nPath-3 Imatinib 600 mg to sunitinib 144,524 4.286 30,400\nPath-4 Imatinib 600 mg 147,060 4.256 Dominated\nPath-5 Imatinib 800 mg to sunitinib 151,560 3.659 Dominated\nPath-6 Imatinib 800 mg 153,901 3.635 Dominated\nPath-2 Imatinib 600 to 800 mg to sunitinib 170,364 4.803 49,940\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

When society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY is between approximately \n\u00a325,000 and \u00a345,000 then Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, is most likely to be considered cost-\neffective. Beyond a threshold of approximately \u00a345,000, Path-2, imatinib 600 mg\/day to imatinib \n800 mg\/day to sunitinib, is most likely to be cost-effective.\nThe results of the economic analysis are based upon sparse data that are potentially biased and \nare surrounded by considerable imprecision. In particular, data for sunitinib and for imatinib \n600 mg\/day are the most suspect. The analysis has also not considered two main areas of \nuncertainty due to lack of data:\n  \u25a0 The considerable uncertainty around the extrapolation from the sparse data on death and \nresponse rate and the impact of alternative assumptions about how probabilities of death and \nresponse change over time.\n  \u25a0 Reductions in utility associated with adverse effects of treatment.\nBy assuming constant probabilities over time, death may be overestimated at earlier time points \nand underestimated at later stages of the time horizon of the model. The probability of death \nmay increase over time as the disease progresses. Similarly the probability of non-response may \nincrease over time and patients may have an increasing need for an escalated dose of imatinib, \nor sunitinib. The assumption of constant probability over time generally delays the transition \nto patients\u2019 deaths. This means that our analysis has a bigger impact on the most effective \ntreatments. These treatments will also incur high treatment costs over a longer period. The net \nimpact of these two changes on cost-effectiveness is unclear.\nThe net impact of adjusting scores for adverse effects is also uncertain but it might be expected \nthat it will reduce the QALYs associated with each medication and, although there are limited \ndata available from the systematic review of clinical effectiveness, this reduction may be greater \nfor pathways involving sunitinib because its adverse effect profile is believed to be worse than that \nof imatinib.111\nOwing to sparse data for this analysis, few data were available on the utility values for defined \ndisease states in the model. Furthermore, the disease states selected in the model may not \nbe complete and exhaustive as data on alternative plausible disease states were not available. \nSensitivity analysis explored uncertainty in key parameter estimates but clearly this does not \ninvestigate the influence of structural assumptions such as the limited number of disease states \nchosen for the modelling. A more sophisticated model would have allowed further sensitivity \nanalysis but without at least some data to guide assumptions we would have needed to identify \nthreshold values for many individual parameters and combinations of parameters. This would \nhave resulted in a substantially expanded economics chapter reporting extensive speculative \nresults that would have been very difficult to interpret.\nA further factor not considered by the economic model was the cost-effectiveness of treatment \nfor those with specific gene mutations. Again this was not addressed owing to lack of data, and \nas there were also no data available to assess the impact of plasma monitoring on the study \npopulation of interest, this was also not considered by the economic model.\nFinally, the economic evaluation has assumed that patients who move on to BSC remain on \ntreatment to prevent tumour flare. This has the impact of increasing the cost of BSC. It is further \nassumed that there is no impact on effectiveness (the implicit assumption is that discontinuing \nthe medication would reduce life expectancy). Within the analysis it has been assumed that all 56 Assessment of cost-effectiveness\npatients on BSC or moving on to BSC after failing to respond on a medication would receive \nimatinib 400 mg\/day. This assumption appears reasonable for Path-1, BSC, but may not be \nappropriate for the other pathways where patients would move on to BSC after failing to respond \non an escalated dose of imatinib or on sunitinib. Should these patients continue with the last \nactive medication that they received then costs, and incremental costs per QALY, would increase.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

The incidence and subsequent overall burden on the NHS is not large, and only \na small proportion of patients with GIST will have unresectable and\/or metastatic disease that \nprogresses on imatinib at a dose of 400 mg\/day. NICE guidance on imatinib for the treatment of \nunresectable and\/or metastatic GIST does not recommend an increase in the dose of imatinib \nfor people receiving imatinib who develop PD after initially responding at the 400 mg\/day dose.50 \nSome guidelines, however, do advocate dose escalation for such patients, particularly those with \nKIT exon 9 mutations, indicating that escalated doses may help this group of GIST patients and \noffer them the opportunity to continue with a normal life for a longer period of time.15,114,115\nSince the availability of sunitinib, guidance on the treatment of patients with unresectable and\/\nor metastatic GIST has been adapted to take account of this drug as a possible second-line \ntreatment15 in circumstances where patients either are intolerant to imatinib, or have progressed \non treatment with imatinib at a 400 mg\/day dose. NICE guidance recommends sunitinib as a \ntreatment option for people with unresectable and\/or metastatic malignant GIST if imatinib \ntreatment has failed because of resistance or intolerance, and the drug cost of sunitinib for the \nfirst treatment cycle is met by the manufacturer.\nIn clinical practice the treatment of patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST is \ngenerally decided on a case-by-case basis by multidisciplinary teams. Many clinicians advocate \ninitial dose escalation of imatinib and then consider sunitinib on subsequent progression, \nalthough practice will vary depending on the specific needs of individual patients.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

Five studies involving 669 patients from within the relevant \ntreatment arms met the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, four involving 318 patients reported \nimatinib outcomes and one involving 351 patients, who had received a prior imatinib dose of \n\u2264 400 mg\/day, reported sunitinib outcomes. No studies reporting BSC were identified that met \nour inclusion criteria.\nAlthough the study designs for most of the included trials were RCTs (plus one retrospective \ncohort study) none of these trials had, as their primary objective, the assessment of the effects of \ndose escalation following progression on 400 mg\/day imatinib. Only a proportion of the overall \npatient populations received an escalated dose, and these patients were not randomised at the \npoint of dose escalation to receive either an escalated dose of imatinib or remain on 400 mg\/day. \nTherefore, the nature of the evidence base for patients who progress on 400 mg\/day imatinib and \nreceive escalated doses of 600 or 800 mg\/day is observational and open to bias.\nThe sample sizes of the studies from which the 669 patients were drawn from ranged from 2479 \nto 111786 participants. Each study had more male than female participants. The vast majority \nof participants in each study had an ECOG performance status of \u2264 2, meaning that they were \nambulatory and confined to bed for less than 50% of their waking hours.116 Of the studies that \nreported the proportion of the study population receiving prior surgery,39,44,79 most patients had \nundergone prior surgery for treatment of their disease. Information on the characteristics of all \nthe 669 patients relevant to this review was not provided separately.\nFrom the data on imatinib it can be seen that approximately one-third of patients progressing \non 400 mg\/day of imatinib will respond to escalated doses. With 600 mg\/day, between 25.6% \n(11\/43)39 and 41.7% (5\/12)79 of patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic GIST, who had \npreviously progressed on a dose of 400 mg\/day of imatinib, either developed a PR or maintained \nSD. With 800 mg\/day, the proportions achieving PR or SD ranged between 29.3%44 and 33.3%.79 \nThese data were used to inform transition probabilities of non-response to imatinib at escalated \ndoses of 600 and 800 mg\/day, respectively. However, response data were not available for patients \nreceiving sunitinib following treatment with imatinib at a dose of \u2264 400 mg\/day. As an alternative \nto excluding sunitinib entirely, which could arguably have been appropriate given the lack of \ndata, the economic model used data that did not meet the inclusion criteria for the review of \nclinical effectiveness because it failed to report response data separately for those progressing on \na 400 mg\/day dose. A further assumption made in the economic model was that response was \nunaffected by prior treatment received. This assumption was made because of a lack of data on \nhow response might change over time and be affected by prior treatments other than imatinib at \n400 mg\/day.60 Discussion\nMedian OS data were not reported for those receiving an escalated imatinib dose of 600 mg\/day \nupon progression at a 400 mg\/day dose. Therefore, the economic model calculated the probability \nof death from the available trial data on median OS according to best response, and the \nproportion of patients receiving escalated doses who will have had a response to imatinib at the \ninitial 400 mg\/day dose prior to eventual progression and dose escalation.\nFor those receiving an escalated imatinib dose of 800 mg\/day upon progression, median OS was \nreported to be 19 months (95% CI 13 to 23 months) in the S0033 trial.41 Median OS was not \nreported for the EORTC-ISG-AGITG study44 for the population of interest, (CiC information has \nbeen removed). For those receiving sunitinib after a prior imatinib dose of \u2264 400 mg\/day, median \nOS was reported as 22.5 months (95% CI 18.3 to 26.5 months).86\nFigure 3 provided a visual comparison of the median OS times for imatinib at an escalated dose \nof 800 mg\/day and sunitinib, showing overlapping CIs until 33 months from commencement of \ntreatment, at which point the estimated proportion of sunitinib patients surviving appeared to \nbe less than the proportion surviving on the 800 mg\/day imatinib dose. (CiC information has \nbeen removed.) It is difficult to draw any conclusions with regard to possible differences in OS \nbetween imatinib at an escalated dose of 800 mg\/day and sunitinib at 50 mg\/day (with a 4-weeks-\non\/2-weeks-off cycle), owing to the lack of data, but as the 95% CIs for median OS overlap, there \ndoes not appear to be any significant difference in median OS with dose escalation, compared \nwith sunitinib.\nThe median time to progression and PFS was reported for imatinib 600 mg\/day as 1.7 months \n(range 0.7\u201324.9 months),79 and for imatinib 800 mg\/day it ranged between 2.9 months (reported \nwithout CIs as \u201881 days\u2019)44 and 5 months (95% CI 2 to 10 months).41 A visual representation of \nthese data for imatinib 800 mg\/day in Figure 4 gives 95% CIs that do not overlap, for all time \npoints between 12 and 21 months, indicating that PFS was significantly shorter in the EORTC-\nISG-AGITG study reported by Zalcberg et al.44 than in the S0033 trial reported by Blanke et al.41\nIn addition, those studies looking at an 800 mg\/day dose of imatinib reported that between \n16.1% (19\/118) and 18.8% (25\/133) of patients were progression free at the time of the analysis. \nThis represented a proportion of between 52.8% (19\/36) and 64.1% (25\/39) of all of those \nachieving PR and SD on the 800 mg\/day dose. This suggests that a small proportion (i.e. < 20%) \nof those receiving an escalated dose of 800 mg\/day of imatinib on progression may maintain \ntheir response\/SD for a median time period of at least 25 months (i.e. the shorter of the median \nfollow-up times reported by these trials), and those who achieve a response or maintain SD on \nthe escalated dose may have a greater than 50% likelihood of maintaining this in the longer term.\nFor those receiving an escalated dose of 800 mg\/day, the study by Zalcberg et al.44 reported \na median duration of \u2018stabilisation\u2019 among those showing response or SD with treatment of \n153 days (range 37\u2013574 days). For sunitinib, the treatment duration for all patients receiving \nsunitinib (i.e. regardless of the dose of prior imatinib therapy) was 126 days (range 1\u2013618 days).86\nData on adverse events were not available from any of the studies where the population of interest \nreceived imatinib at 600 mg\/day or sunitinib following progression at 400 mg\/day. For the trials \nreporting outcomes following dose escalation from 400 to 800 mg\/day after progression at the \nlower dose, it was reported that the vast majority (88.4%) of study discontinuations were due to \ndisease progression and not study drug toxicity.44 (CiC information has been removed.)\nNevertheless, it was also reported that between 15.6%77 and 31%78 of patients receiving an \nescalated imatinib dose of 800 mg\/day required a dose reduction. It was also reported that \n23.3% (18\/77) of patients required at least one dose delay.77 However, it was not possible to take \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

This was because \ninformation on the dose provided following reduction, the median duration of any dose delay or \ndose reduction, and any other factors, besides toxicity, contributing to any of the dose delays or \nreductions were not reported.\nThese data on discontinuations and dose modifications indicate that, although disease \nprogression is far more likely than adverse events to contribute to the decision to stop escalated \nimatinib treatment at the 800 mg\/day dose, approximately one-third of patients will require dose \nmodifications (i.e. dose reduction or interruption) during treatment at this escalated dose.\nWith regard to specific adverse events, data were reported by Zalcberg et al.44 showing \nthat a higher proportion of patients with skin rash, nausea, leucopenia, neutropenia and \nthrombocytopenia reported a reduction in the severity of these events following dose escalation \ncompared with the proportion of patients reporting an increase in these events. This reduction \nwas significant in the case of neutropenia (p = 0.002). However, the proportion of patients with \noedema, fatigue, dyspnoea and anaemia who reported an increase in severity of these events \nfollowing dose escalation was greater than the proportion of patients who reported a reduction \nin these events. This increase in severity was significant in the case of fatigue (p < 0.001) and \nanaemia (p = 0.015).44 (CiC information has been removed.) It is difficult to draw any conclusions \nabout specific adverse events from these data, aside from noting that fatigue and anaemia may \nsignificantly increase upon dose escalation from 400 mg\/day imatinib to 800 mg\/day.\nThe only data available for any of the prespecified subgroups of interest were reported by Debiec-\nRychter et al.14 for the EORTC-ISG-AGITG trial, which looked at imatinib dose escalation from \n400 to 800 mg\/day following progression at the lower dose. They noted that patients with wild \ntype, and those with exon 9 mutations, were significantly more likely to have a response to dose \nescalation than those with exon 11 mutations, but no numerical data were reported for the \npopulation of interest. (CiC information has been removed.) Furthermore, it has been argued \nthat subgroups with certain exon mutations might have improved response and\/or survival \noutcomes if they initially receive an escalated imatinib dose, rather than receiving dose escalation \nonly if there is progression at the 400 mg\/day dose.114\nIt was outwith the remit of this review to consider outcomes for patients receiving escalated \ndosing other than following progression on the initial 400 mg\/day dose. The lack of data available \nmeant it was not possible to assess for specific mutational population subgroups the effects of \nescalation to an imatinib dose of 800 mg\/day following progression at the initial 400 mg\/day dose.\nReview of cost-effectiveness\nThe economic component of this study included both a review of the existing economic \nevaluations and an economic modelling exercise. The evidence from the review of economic \nevaluations was sparse and there was no published economic evaluation conducted for a UK \ncontext that compared all of the interventions for the patient group of interest.\nThe modelling exercise compared alternative treatment pathways for patients with unresectable \nGIST who failed to respond to imatinib 400 mg\/day. Over almost all the sensitivity analyses, \nPath-1, BSC, is the least costly and least effective intervention. Similarly, Path-4, imatinib \n600 mg\/day, typically has an incremental cost per QALY that is less than \u00a330,000 compared with \nPath-1, BSC. Path-2 (imatinib 600 mg\/day to 800 mg\/day to sunitinib) is the only other pathway \nthat is not dominated or extendedly dominated over most of the analyses conducted. However, \nin this case the incremental cost per QALY (compared with the next most costly option: Path-4, \nimatinib 600 mg\/day) tends to be > \u00a340,000.62 Discussion\nWhen society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY is < ~\u00a325,000, Path-1, BSC, is the most cost-\neffective intervention. When society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY is between approximately \n\u00a325,000 and \u00a345,000, Path-4, imatinib 600 mg\/day, is most likely to be considered cost-effective. \nBeyond a threshold of approximately \u00a345,000, Path-2, imatinib 600 mg\/day to imatinib \n800 mg\/day to sunitinib, is most likely to be cost-effective.\nAs discussed below, these data should be treated cautiously, as the data used are observational \nand non-comparative. Furthermore, the data on sunitinib and imatinib 600 mg\/day are \nparticularly sparse and potentially unreliable. For example, data on treatment with sunitinib \nshow a lower life expectancy than those on treatment with BSC (although sunitinib has greater \nQALYs). This means that when the cost of sunitinib is reduced it becomes more cost-effective \nthan BSC, as the potentially unreliable source data for life expectancy on sunitinib mean that \npatients on sunitinib will not survive long enough to incur higher costs of treatment. Although \nsufficient evidence on the effectiveness of sunitinib compared with BSC following treatment \non imatinib at a 400 mg\/day dose was not available, evidence on the effectiveness of sunitinib \ncompared with BSC regardless of prior imatinib dose suggests that life expectancy with sunitinib \nis superior.\nIn addition, the data available for imatinib at a dose of 600 mg\/day suggested superior \neffectiveness compared with the 800 mg\/day dose. This is because the evidence on imatinib at \nthe 600 mg\/day dose was based on a smaller sample size (43 patients), making the model results \nfor this pathway potentially counterintuitive if we expect higher drug doses to have greater \neffectiveness than lower doses.\nStrengths and limitations of the assessment\nIn terms of strengths, the review of the evidence base was detailed and thorough. It was unclear \nfrom the information provided in a substantial number of abstracts whether the studies met \nthe inclusion criteria and full-text papers for all of these reports were obtained and assessed. \nNon-English language studies were not excluded. Authors were contacted in an attempt to \nobtain additional information concerning their studies. For the review of economic evaluations, \na rigorous systematic approach was adopted. The economic model considered a large number \nof plausible alternative treatments and also incorporated both probabilistic and deterministic \nestimates of cost effectiveness. The former was limited to clinical effectiveness parameters but this \nlimitation was chosen specifically to draw attention to the uncertainties surrounding these data.\nIn terms of limitations, there was a dearth of evidence available on the specific population of \ninterest, despite the overall large evidence base on the treatment of GISTs with imatinib or \nsunitinib. The quality of reporting of dose information in reports of imatinib or sunitinib for \nGISTs was poor and the data on the population of interest for the studies that were included \nwere non-randomised, non-comparative and therefore observational. Therefore, lack of quality \ndata, as well as lack of data itself, severely limited both assessments of clinical effectiveness and \ncost-effectiveness.\nThere was also a lack of evidence on QoL outcomes, which may be of fundamental importance \nto patients given the potentially palliative nature of treatment following progression, and there \nwas also a lack of evidence on BSC. This is important as since the development of imatinib and \nsunitinib, it no longer represents the only treatment option for those with unresectable\/metastatic \ndisease. There was little evidence on response to escalated doses of imatinib based on mutational \nstatus, specifically for those who had already failed on an initial imatinib dose of 400 mg\/day. It \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\n63   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\nwas also not possible to account for the effects of required dose interruptions and reductions, or \nthe effects of sunitinib on those intolerant to imatinib, owing to the lack of available data. This \nlack of data also prevented comparative analysis of adverse events between the intervention and \ncomparator treatments.\nFor sunitinib, it was also necessary to assume that the vast majority of those receiving sunitinib \nafter imatinib treatment at \u2264 400 mg\/day had actually received imatinib at 400 mg\/day, which may \nnot be a valid assumption. However, it was not possible to confirm the validity of the assumption \ndespite contacting the study authors (P Reichardt, HELIOS Klnikum Bad Saarow, Germany, \n2010, personal correspondence). In addition, much of the evidence base for sunitinib generally \nrelates to its use following the failure of escalated doses of imatinib rather than failure on \n400 mg\/day, suggesting that the role of sunitinib is seen more as a third-line treatment rather than \na potential comparator to 600 mg\/day or 800 mg\/day imatinib treatment. This was highlighted by \nthe manufacturer of imatinib in their submission for this technology appraisal, and is noted in \nChapter 3 of this report.\nFor the economic model, sufficient sound comparative data for the different plausible treatments \nwere not available, despite conducting an extensive review of relevant studies. This necessitated \na number of simplifying assumptions being made with respect to the model and also the use of \ndata that were potentially unreliable. The model assumes that patients entering a pathway will \nremain in that treatment for one cycle only if they do not respond and survive in the treatment \narm. In these cases they are considered to move to the escalated doses, move to another \nalternative (if allowed by a treatment pathway) or continue with BSC for the remainder of the \nmodel time horizon or until they die. The care pathways considered in the economic model are \nnot an exhaustive list of all possible treatment options available but represent plausible treatment \nscenarios. Some are likely to be more representative of clinical practice than others. Whilst \nadditional clinical advice during the development of the care pathways might have increased the \nextent to which the chosen scenarios reflect true clinical practice, it may also have increased the \nlevel of complexity required within the model. Given the lack of robust data it was felt that a more \nsophisticated model would be difficult to populate.\nWithin the model, several simplifying assumptions had to be made for individual parameters. \nFor example, it was necessary to consider the costs and utilities associated with BSC as consistent \nacross all care pathways despite the fact that in clinical practice the costs of BSC may increase as \nan individual\u2019s health deteriorates. Unfortunately, there were no data available to model how costs \nof BSC might increase and QoL might fall over time.\nA further simplifying assumption was not to model the complications and side effects of therapy. \nThis latter assumption was made owing to the very limited evidence available. This is coupled \nwith the assumption made that the utility associated with stable response or progression did \nnot vary between treatments. One impact of this assumption is that no utility decrement has \nbeen assumed for the arguably worse side effect profile of sunitinib. This means that pathways \ninvolving sunitinib may overestimate QALYs.\nPerhaps a more important limitation is caused by the limited evidence base available. With \nrespect to the clinical effectiveness data used to derive transition probabilities these data, \nas already noted, were based upon non-randomised, non-comparative data. Such data are \npotentially biased as well as being imprecise. In particular, it is worth noting that point estimates \nof death and response used within the model may be misleading, for example the point estimates \nused suggest that sunitinib has a higher mortality rate than BSC.64 Discussion\nUncertainties\nFor the assessment of clinical effectiveness:\n  \u25a0 The diagnosis of GIST as stated in the final scope document was based on a positive KIT \n(CD117) test. However, this is not a perfect test and in a small (< 5%) number of cases a \npatient can have a GIST despite having a negative KIT (CD117) test.4,7,25 More recent tests \n(e.g. PDGRFA and DOG1) may clarify diagnosis. However, the WHO classification of GI \ntumours recommends that a diagnosis of GIST should only apply to those patients testing \npositive for the KIT (CD117) protein.\n  \u25a0 It was not possible to conduct any subgroup analysis for patients with particular mutations, \nor consider the methods used to identify response (e.g. FDG-PET or CT scanning), or \npossible factors related to the provision of dose-escalated imatinib in an adjuvant or \nneoadjuvant setting.\n  \u25a0 It was not possible within the time frame of this review for sufficient information to be \nprovided that would have enabled meta-analysis of outcomes for the 800 mg\/day dose \nof imatinib. This evidence may have enabled more robust estimates of survival following \ndose escalation to 800 mg\/day. However, the data would still be prone to bias (being taken \nfrom data from a non-randomised patient population) and uncertainty surrounding other \nparameters (e.g. BSC, sunitinib and imatinib at 600 mg\/day) would still be likely to make the \nmodel difficult to interpret.\n  \u25a0 Following progression, the proportion of patients subsequently progressing on escalated \ndoses, who are kept on the study drug on the basis that progression of disease might be \nslower than if the patient were to be taken off the drug, is not known. It is also not clear \nwhether there is a standard dose used for this purpose. Within the economic model it has \nbeen assumed that this would be the case (400 mg\/day).\n  \u25a0 This review only considered drug treatments that were licensed for patients with GISTs \nand did not consider other drugs that may be being used in the treatment of GISTs, or \nlicensed drugs that are being used \u2018off licence\u2019 to treat GIST (e.g. imatinib at doses exceeding \n800 mg\/day, or sunitinib provided in a continuous daily dosing regime).\n  \u25a0 Surgical interventions were also not considered even though surgery is an important \ntreatment option for GIST patients, and even though those with unresectable disease may be \neligible for surgery if their tumours become resectable following treatment with an escalated \ndose of imatinib. The role of emergency surgery as part of BSC was also not considered.\nThe economic model has also not considered three main areas of uncertainty due to lack of data:\n  \u25a0 alternative assumptions about how probabilities of death and response change over time\n  \u25a0 reductions in utility associated with side effects of treatment\n  \u25a0 impact on cost-effectiveness for people with different gene mutations.\nThe impact of making alternative assumptions about how probabilities for death and response \nchange is unknown but it is anticipated that the assumption of constant probabilities over time \nwill exaggerate estimated life expectancy (and hence QALYs and cost) for all pathways. The net \nimpact on relative cost-effectiveness is unclear as it depends upon the magnitude of any changes \nin both costs and QALYs that might occur.\nA further uncertainty is the probability of death for BSC. No studies for this comparator met the \ninclusion criteria for the review. The only sources available for this parameter were from studies \npublished in the pre-imatinib era where the population could not have been exposed to a prior \n400 mg\/day dose of imatinib, and the proportion of the study populations with KIT-positive \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\n65   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\nGIST was not known. With regard to the impact of this uncertainty on the economic model, it \nis reasonable to assume that if, for example, there was an increase in mortality for BSC, the costs \nand QALYs associated with each of the pathways would fall because BSC is included within \neach pathway.\nThe net impact of adjusting utility scores for side effects is also uncertain but it might be expected \nthat it will reduce the QALYs associated with each medication and, although there are limited \ndata available from the systematic review of effectiveness, this reduction may be greater for \npathways involving sunitinib because its side effect profile is believed to be worse than that \nof imatinib.\nA further factor not considered by the economic model was the cost-effectiveness of treating \npatients with specific gene mutations. Again this was not addressed owing to lack of data.\nNo studies looking at plasma monitoring met our inclusion criteria, but its potential, along \nwith that of mutation testing, as an early predictor of the need for escalated imatinib dosing \nmay have implications for both the costs and effects of escalated doses, because it may allow \nthe identification of those people who are expected to respond better to escalated doses quickly \nand hence they may be given escalated doses immediately rather than waiting for progression \nto occur at the 400 mg\/day dose. If either of these practices become widely adopted within the \nNHS then the evidence on the effect of imatinib dose escalation following progression at the \nstandard 400 mg\/day dose will become less relevant to clinical practice. Should mutation testing \nand plasma monitoring allow the tailoring of dose escalation then we might expect the benefits \nto those who receive therapy to be increased, particularly at earlier stages of treatment (although \nthis also means that there may be fewer remaining treatment options following failure at the \nescalated dose). Costs would also increase owing to both the cost of mutation testing or plasma \nmonitoring, and also the costs of escalated doses that are incurred earlier. The net impact of this \non cost-effectiveness is unclear.\nFinally, the economic evaluation has assumed that patients who move on to BSC still receive \nmedication to prevent tumour flare. This has the impact of increasing the cost of BSC. It is further \nassumed that there is no impact on effectiveness (the implicit assumption is that discontinuing \nthe medication would reduce life expectancy). Within the analysis it has been assumed that all \npatients on BSC or moving on to BSC after failing to respond to a medication would receive \nimatinib 400 mg\/day. This assumption appears reasonable for Path-1, BSC only, but may not be \nappropriate for the other pathways where patients would move on to BSC after failing to respond \nto an escalated dose of imatinib, or on sunitinib. Should these patients continue with the last \nactive medication that they received then costs, and incremental costs per QALY, would increase.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

The results themselves indicate that should society\u2019s \nthreshold for willingness to pay be less than \u00a325,000 per QALY a pathway of BSC only has \nthe highest probability of being cost-effective. Between a threshold of \u00a325,000 and \u00a345,000 \nprovision of an escalated dose of imatinib would be most likely to be cost-effective. Above \na threshold of \u00a345,000 a pathway of escalated doses of imatinib followed by sunitinib, if \nnecessary, would be most likely to be cost-effective.\n  \u25a0 In terms of policy-making, the results of this review and economic model show that the \ncurrent evidence available on the effectiveness of imatinib dose escalation for GIST patients \nfollowing progression on the standard 400 mg\/day dose is characterised by such a high \ndegree of uncertainty that, in the authors\u2019 opinion, it would be inappropriate to conclude that \ndose escalation of imatinib would be a cost-effective strategy for the NHS.\nRecommendations for research\nFurther evidence is needed in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness \nand cost-effectiveness of the alternative treatments for patients with GIST who fail on or become \nresistant to imatinib 400 mg\/day. Ideally, such data would come from RCTs involving patients \nwho progress on 400 mg\/day of imatinib, where patients are randomised to 600 mg\/day imatinib, \n800 mg\/day imatinib or sunitinib, or to remain on 400 mg\/day imatinib. However, such a study \nmay be difficult to organise, as neither patients nor practitioners may be in equipoise. Dose \nescalation appears to be used within the NHS already and hence health-care professionals may \nnot find it acceptable that their patients could be randomised to \u2018BSC\u2019. Therefore, alternative \nquasi-experimental or observational designs should be considered but with sufficient focus on \nunderstanding and controlling for selection biases.\nThe pathways most likely to be cost-effective at thresholds society might be willing to pay and \nhence potentially the most useful to assess would be dose escalation with imatinib and dose 68 Conclusions\nescalation with imatinib followed by sunitinib if necessary. Such studies should as a matter of \ncourse include an economic evaluation and measurement of health-state utilities (where there is \ncurrently a dearth of evidence for each of the relevant health states for GIST patients), and would \nneed to measure outcomes over a sufficiently long time period to capture the main impact on \ncosts and outcomes. Where possible further studies should also report outcomes for subgroups of \npatients with specific KIT mutations.\nWith respect to costs, should further comparative studies be conducted, estimates of the usage \nof health services might usefully be collected. A wider perspective on the consideration of costs \nmight also be informative, for example costs that fall on PSS (which would be relevant for NICE \nto consider) and costs for patients and their families (which goes beyond NICE\u2019s reference case).\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

People will be diagnosed with this type of \ncancer only if a biopsy of their tumours tests positive for a particular protein (called \u2018KIT\u2019 or \n\u2018CD117\u2019). In around half of all cases it is possible to remove the tumour surgically; however, \noverall at least 50% of those operated on will develop recurrent disease within 5 years. In these \npatients with recurrence, and other patients with inoperable disease at diagnosis, survival beyond \na period of 2 years is uncommon without further treatment. The usual treatment for patients \nwith inoperable GISTs is the drug imatinib, prescribed at a dose of 400 mg per day. Over 75% \nof patients will show either response or stable disease (SD) with the standard dose of imatinib, \nwhich typically provides control of the GISTs for a period of 2\u20133 years. Approximately 50% of 126 Appendix 7\npatients will survive 5 years or more with this treatment. However, in all patients, resistance of the \nGISTs to imatinib will eventually occur and the disease will then progress. Genetic differences, \nfor example whether certain mutations in the c-KIT or CD117 gene are present in patients or \nnot, may help clinicians\u2019 understanding of who is more likely to be able to tolerate the drug and\/\nor have least resistance to it. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) \nscans may also be useful to detect early response or resistance to imatinib and these measures \nmay allow more individualised treatment approaches. At present, increasing the dose of imatinib, \nwhen 400 mg per day ceases to improve a patient\u2019s condition, is not officially recommended \n(although in practice it is usually tried). An alternative drug (sunitinib) is recommended to be \nprescribed in cases where imatinib has failed. The only other alternative to these treatments for \npatients with inoperable GISTs is to provide BSC through management of the patient\u2019s pain and \nother symptoms, and attend to their needs and general well-being, without providing treatment \nto actively fight the cancer itself. However, in reality it is likely that all patients (including those \nreceiving active treatment) will receive supportive care as part of this treatment.\nThis review will look at two alternative doses of imatinib (600 and 800 mg per day) and compare \nthese with the current recommended treatment alternatives (i.e. sunitinib and\/or BSC) for those \npatients with inoperable GISTs whose disease progresses while on imatinib at a dose of 400 mg \nper day.\nDecision problem\nGastrointestinal stromal tumours are tumours of the connective tissue of the gastrointestinal \n(GI) tract arising in the interstitial cells of Cajal. They are rare cancers and estimated to account \nfor 1% of all tumours arising in the GI tract.1 It is estimated that the vast majority (between 60% \nand 70%) will arise in the stomach, though they can also occur in the small bowel (25\u201335%), \ncolon and rectum (5%), and, to a lesser extent, the oesophagus.2 Estimates of the number of \npeople affected by GIST vary, but it is thought that the annual incidence is unlikely to exceed \n240.3 However, previous estimates have suggested that it could be as high as 2000 cases per year.3 \nThe median age at time of first presentation is approximately 60 years.4 Prognosis for patients \nwith GISTs is highly dependent on the resectability of the tumour and approximately half of \npatients with GISTs will have resectable disease at first presentation. GISTs are resistant to the \n\u2018conventional\u2019 oncology treatments of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. For resectable\/\nnon-metastatic tumours, prognosis gives a 10-year survival rate of 30\u201350% of patients, and \nat least 50% will relapse within 5 years,5 but for unresectable tumours prognosis is poor, with \nsurvival generally < 2 years without further treatment.6\nFor a GIST to be diagnosed, it is widely accepted that a positive test result (at protein level) for \nthe marker KIT (CD117) is required. KIT (CD117) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that provides a \nmajor pathogenic drive for the majority of GISTs by promoting tumour growth and inhibiting \ntumour cell death. There has been some debate on the definition of a GIST, as it has been noted \nthat in extremely rare cases (< 5%) a patient can have a GIST despite testing negative for c-KIT \nprotein expression and in most of these cases a mutation of the platelet-derived growth factor \nreceptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene has been detected.7\u20139 However, the World Health Organization \n(WHO) classification of GI tumours recommends that a diagnosis of GIST should only apply to \nthose patients testing positive for the KIT (CD117) protein.10\nImatinib is manufactured by Novartis under the names Glivec\uf8e8 (in Europe) and Gleevec\uf8e8 (in the \nUSA). Having originally been licensed as a treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia, it was first \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\n127   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\nlicensed for treatment of GIST in 2002 and is now the standard first-line treatment for \u2018locally \nadvanced, inoperable patients and metastatic patients\u2019 with GIST.11 The 2004 National Institute \nfor Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Technology Appraisal no. 86 on the use of imatinib for \nthe treatment of unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs recommends 400 mg per day as first-line \nmanagement. At present the NICE guidance does not recommend dose escalation of imatinib \nfor those whose disease progresses after initially responding at the 400 mg per day dose, although \ndose escalation has been noted to be the standard approach to disease progression where patient \nnon-adherence or intolerance to imatinib are not factors in disease progression.11\nThe alternative treatments available for unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs are sunitinib \n(manufactured by Pfizer) and best supportive care (BSC). Sunitinib is recommended for patients \nwith unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs if treatment with imatinib has failed because of \nresistance or intolerance, and the drug cost for the first treatment cycle will be met by the \nmanufacturer.12 BSC is less well defined or standardised in different clinical trials or treatment \nprotocols, and has also been referred to as \u2018active symptom control\u2019.2 It has been said to involve \ninterventions to manage pain, treat fever, anaemia (due to GI haemorrhage) and GI obstruction,1 \nand can include palliative measures.13 In a Cochrane review of supportive care for patients with \nGI cancer, supportive care was defined as \u2018the multi-professional attention to the individual\u2019s \noverall physical, psychosocial, spiritual and cultural needs\u2019.14 It was argued that this type of care \nshould ethically be made available to all treatment groups, meaning that in practice for patients \nwith GISTs, treatment with imatinib or sunitinib would not be provided without supportive care \nas well, though it is possible that treatment with BSC could be provided without additional drug \ntreatment with either imatinib or sunitinib.\nThe survival of patients with GISTs is largely dependent on whether or not the tumour is \nresectable. For patients with unresectable and\/or metastatic disease, the treatment options are \nimatinib, sunitinib or BSC. Guidance is available on the effectiveness of imatinib at the 400 mg \nper day dose.1 However, assessment is required of the clinical effectiveness of imatinib at higher \ndosages (i.e. 600 and 800 mg per day) in patients whose disease has progressed on treatment \nwith the 400 mg dose, given that an estimated 16% of patients will experience primary resistance \nto imatinib, and all will develop resistance and progressive disease (PD) at a later stage.15 In \nevaluating the effectiveness of escalated doses of imatinib or other alternate treatments it is \nalso necessary to consider subgroups of patients with specific KIT mutations who may respond \ndifferently to treatment, and also note how rapidly, and by what method (e.g. FDG-PET scans), \nthese patients were identified.\nThis review will assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of imatinib at escalated \ndoses of 600 mg per day, and 800 mg per day, compared with treatment using sunitinib, or BSC, \nin patients with KIT (CD117)-positive unresectable and\/or metastatic malignant GISTs, whose \ndisease has progressed on treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg per day.\nReport methods for synthesis of evidence of clinical \neffectiveness\nA systematic review of the evidence of the clinical effectiveness of imatinib at escalated doses \nof 600 or 800 mg per day will be undertaken following the general principles of the guidance of \nthe Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) for undertaking reviews in health care16 and \nreported in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and \nMeta-Analyses) statement.17128 Appendix 7\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTypes of studies\nThe types of studies considered will be randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised \ncomparative studies and case series. If the number of studies meeting our inclusion criteria is \nsufficiently large, we may consider limiting them by type of study design and taking into account \nthe importance of other factors, such as sample size.\nScoping searches have already been conducted and fewer than 40 potentially relevant studies \nwere found looking specifically at either of the named interventions (i.e. imatinib at 600 or \n800 mg per day).\nPopulation\nThe population considered will be people with KIT (CD117)-positive unresectable and\/or \nmetastatic malignant GISTs, whose disease has progressed on treatment with imatinib at a dose \nof 400 mg per day.\nIf there is sufficient evidence, subgroup analysis will be undertaken for those patients with \ndifferent mutations of CD117 that are likely to affect their response to escalated doses of imatinib. \nData will also be recorded on the methods used to identify response or resistance (e.g. FDG-PET \nor CT scanning), and whether or not imatinib had been prescribed in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant \nsetting for patients with previously resectable GIST.\nIntervention\nThe intervention considered will be imatinib at escalated doses of 600 and 800 mg per day, being \nprescribed in addition to BSC.\nComparators\nThe comparators considered will be sunitinib, prescribed within its recommended dose \nrange of 27\u201375 mg, and provided with BSC, and BSC only. BSC has been defined above (see \nDecision problem).\nOutcomes\nThe following outcomes will be considered:\n  \u25a0 overall response\n  \u25a0 overall survival (OS)\n  \u25a0 disease-free survival\n  \u25a0 progression-free survival (PFS)\n  \u25a0 time to treatment failure\n  \u25a0 health-related quality of life (HRQoL)\n  \u25a0 adverse effects of treatment.\nExclusion criteria\nWe will exclude the following types of studies:\n  \u25a0 animal models\n  \u25a0 preclinical and biological studies\n  \u25a0 reviews, editorials, opinions\n  \u25a0 case reports\n  \u25a0 reports investigating technical aspects of the intervention.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

The searches will also be designed to \nretrieve clinical effectiveness studies of the comparator treatments. Databases to be searched \nwill include: MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and \nAllied Health Literature (CINAHL), Science Citation Index (SCI), BIOSIS, Health Management \nInformation Consortium, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for primary research and \nthe Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), the Cochrane Database of Systematic \nReviews (CDSR) and the HTA database for relevant evidence synthesis.\nA preliminary MEDLINE search strategy is provided in the appendix* and will be adapted for use \nin the other databases. Current research registers, including Clinical Trials, Current Controlled \nTrials, UK Clinical Research Network Study Portfolio, WHO International Clinical Trials \nRegistry Platform, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations \nClinical Trials and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) database will \nbe searched to identify ongoing and recently completed trials. Recent conference proceedings of \nkey oncology and GI organisations will also be screened and will include the American Society \nfor Clinical Oncology, the International Society of Gastrointestinal Oncology, and the National \nCancer Research Institute.\nIn addition, an Internet search using copernic agent will be undertaken, and will include \nthe websites of key professional organisations, GIST Support International, and the drug \nmanufacturers Pfizer and Novartis.\nThere will be no language restriction and all databases will be searched from 2000 onwards.\nThe reference lists of all identified studies and evidence syntheses, as well as submissions from \nindustry and other consultees, will be checked for additional references.\nData extraction strategy\nOne reviewer will screen the titles (and abstracts if available) of all reports identified by the \nsearch strategy. Full-text copies of all studies deemed to be potentially relevant will be obtained, \nand two reviewers will independently assess them for inclusion. Any disagreements will be \nresolved by consensus or arbitration by a third party.\nA data extraction form will be developed and piloted. One reviewer will extract details of study \ndesign, participants, intervention, comparator and outcomes. A second reviewer will check the \ndata extraction. Any disagreements will be resolved by consensus or arbitration by a third party.\nQuality assessment strategy\nTwo reviewers will independently assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Any \ndisagreements will be resolved by consensus or arbitration by a third party. Studies will not be \nincluded or excluded on the basis of methodological quality.\nRandomised controlled trials will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s tool for \nassessing risk of bias.18 The tool addresses six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation \nconcealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and \u2018other issues\u2019. \n* Protocol appendices were not provided but are available from the authors on request.130 Appendix 7\nNon-randomised comparative studies will be assessed using an 18-question checklist, with \nthe same checklist minus four questions used to assess the quality of case series. The checklist \nfor non-randomised studies and case series was adapted from several sources, including the \nCRD\u2019s guidance for those carrying out or commissioning reviews,16 Verhagen et al.,19 Downs \nand Black20 and the Generic Appraisal Tool for Epidemiology (GATE), which assesses bias \nand generalisability, sample definition and selection, description of the intervention, outcome \nassessment, adequacy of follow-up and performance of the analysis. The checklist was developed \nthrough the Review Body for Interventional Procedures (ReBIP). ReBIP is a joint venture \nbetween Health Services Research at Sheffield University and the Health Services Research \nUnit at the University of Aberdeen, and works under the auspices of the NICE Interventional \nProcedures Programme (IPP).\nMethods of analysis\/synthesis\nFor relevant outcomes from randomised studies, where appropriate, meta-analysis will be used \nto estimate a summary measure of effect. Dichotomous outcome data for the overall response \noutcome will be combined using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel relative risk (RR) method and continuous \noutcomes will be combined using the inverse-variance weighted mean difference (WMD) \nmethod. For the estimates of RR and WMD 95% CIs and p-values will be calculated. Chi-squared \ntests and I2-statistics will be used to explore statistical heterogeneity across studies. Possible \nreasons for heterogeneity will be explored using sensitivity analysis. Where there is no obvious \nreason for heterogeneity, the implications will be explored using random effects methods.\nPooled weighted ratio of median survival will be derived for OS, disease-free survival and PFS. \nThe hazard ratio (HR) is the most appropriate statistic for time-to-event outcomes (i.e. for time to \ntreatment failure). If available, the HR will be extracted directly from the trial publications. If not \nreported the HR will be extracted from other available summary statistics or from data extracted \nfrom published Kaplan\u2013Meier curves using methods described by Parmar et al.21 A pooled HR \nfrom available RCTs will be obtained by combining the observed (O) minus expected (E) number \nof events and the variance obtained for each trial using a fixed effects model.22 A weighted average \nof survival duration across studies will then be calculated. The chi-squared test for heterogeneity \nwill be used to test for statistical heterogeneity between studies. If no RCT data are available, but \nnon-randomised studies have reported relevant data for this outcome, then assessment of the risk \nof bias and heterogeneity will be undertaken using meta-regression analysis.\nData on adverse effects of treatment and quality of life (QoL) will be collected and combined, \nideally using standardised mean difference to compare QoL, where there are available data to \ndo so.\nIt is expected that studies with direct comparisons of the intervention and comparators are \nlikely to be limited. If feasible, and appropriate where we have non-randomised evidence, \nmeta-analysis models will be used to model survival rates for interventions and comparators. A \n\u2018cross-design\u2019 approach will be adopted to allow non-randomised evidence to be included, while \navoiding the strong assumption of the equivalence of studies. This approach will enable evidence \nfrom RCTs, non-randomised comparative studies and case series to be included.23 Differences \nbetween treatments for survival outcomes will be assessed by the corresponding odds ratio and \n95% credible intervals. These results will be \u2018unadjusted odds ratios\u2019, but meta-analysis models \nadjusting for study type will also be used. The results from these models will produce \u2018adjusted\u2019 \nodds ratios using winbugs software.24\nIf appropriate, and where there are sufficient data to do so, we will consider using a mixed-\ntreatment comparison model for indirect comparisons.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\n131   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\nWhere a quantitative synthesis is considered to be inappropriate or not feasible, a narrative \nsynthesis of results will be provided.\nReport methods for synthesising evidence of cost-effectiveness\nEconomic evaluation\nThe economic impact of GISTs for the UK NHS is associated with its incidence rate, and the \nproportion of patients who may have unresectable disease (and the consequent resource use by \nthe health systems), and burden in terms of patient outcome. Information from the work on an \neconomic model for the UK, mainly from an industry submission, is based on the assumption \nthat the incidence rate is 15 per million population, and 10\u201330% of all patients with GISTs are \nlikely to have resectable disease. If these patients (between 80 and 240 people) are treated with \nimatinib, the annual drug costs per patient to the NHS have been estimated at \u00a318,896 and \n\u00a324,368 for patients on 400 and 600 mg per day, respectively. Other associated yearly costs with \nthe treatment (including the treatment of adverse events) were estimated at \u00a32730. The model \nestimates suggest that in 2 years it would cost the NHS \u00a331,160 to treat a patient with imatinib, \nand in 10 years it would cost the NHS \u00a356,146.2,25 An estimate suggests that the total yearly \ncost to the NHS (England and Wales) for treating with imatinib would be between \u00a35.6M and \n\u00a311.2M. The cost to the NHS would differ when patients who fail to progress with imatinib are \nprovided with higher doses, or other alternative treatments (e.g. treatment with sunitinib). NICE \nestimates suggest the number of new cases of unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs to be around \n240 people per year.3 The economic impact of different treatment strategies needs thorough \ninvestigation for a robust economic evaluation.\nObjectives\nThe aim is to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative treatment \nstrategies for people with KIT (CD117)-positive unresectable and\/or metastatic gastrointestinal \ntumours (GISTs), whose disease has progressed on treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg \nper day.\nThe specific objectives are:\n1.  To determine, by undertaking a systematic review of the literature, the clinical effectiveness \nand cost-effectiveness of using imatinib at an escalated dose of 600 or 800 mg per day to treat \npatients with GISTs (whose disease has progressed with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg per \nday), compared with treating them with sunitinib and BSC.\n2.  To develop an economic model to compare the cost-effectiveness and cost\u2013utility of use \nof imatinib at a dose of 600 or 800 mg per day, or use of sunitinib, or BSC only, for treating \npeople with KIT (CD117)-positive unresectable and\/or metastatic gastrointestinal tumours \n(GISTs) whose disease has progressed on treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg \nper day.\nThe economic assessment will be a comparison of alternative treatments for people with GISTs \nwhose disease has progressed despite treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg per day, or \nthose whose treatment with imatinib has failed owing to resistance or intolerance. The alternative \ntreatments that will be considered are (1) treating with escalated doses of 600 or 800 mg per day; \n(2) treating with sunitinib (within its recommended dosage); and (3) providing BSC to manage \nsymptoms. It should be noted here that BSC is often not provided exclusively. For treatment with \nimatinib, and treatment with sunitinib, it will be assumed that BSC would be provided alongside \nthese treatments.132 Appendix 7\nThe economic assessment will be based on two components: (1) a systematic review of existing \neconomic evaluations of the above alternative treatments and (2) an economic evaluation \nmodelling exercise. More specifically, the economic assessment will consider alternative \ntreatment strategies used for treatment of GISTs (particularly for patients whose disease has \nprogressed with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg per day).\nThe purpose of the review of studies on economic analysis, or economic evaluation, will be to \nidentify published studies and assess their quality and usefulness for comparisons of alternative \ntreatment of GISTs; inform the methodology of the proposed economic model; and identify data \non the parameters of the proposed economic model (e.g. utilities for different health states, costs \nand epidemiological data).\nData sought\nWith respect to costs, data will be sought to gather information on costs to the health services \n(NHS) in treating patients with GISTs and on costs to patients, in order to estimate overall \nmean costs. Specific information will also be collected on (1) the cost of treating the different \nclinical outcomes (e.g. cost of achieving total survival for patients with GISTs whose disease has \nprogressed on treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg per day \u2013 the base case); (2) the costs \nof maintaining patients with GISTs at a disease progression-free state for a specific period of time \nunder alternative treatment strategies; and (3) the cost per life-year gained under alternative \ntreatment strategies. Data will be sought on the costs associated with each alternative. For costs \nto the health services this will include, for example, the mean number of visits to the oncologist, \nnumber of laboratory tests and examinations, radiology examinations, the number of inpatient-\ndays and the costs of drugs. Costs associated with the treatment of adverse effects will be included \nwithin the costs of treatment under different strategies (most of the adverse effects noted in the \nliterature include fatigue and fever, hypertension, GI illnesses, dermatological, haemorrhagic \nevents, etc.), and data will be sought accordingly. Data on costs to patients in seeking care and for \nBSC under different strategies will also be collected.\nWith respect to effectiveness, data will be sought on the same outcomes (OS, disease-free survival \nor PFS, adverse effects of the treatments, time to treatment failure or time to tumour progression, \nand overall response rate) as noted in the review of effectiveness of different strategies (see \nInclusion and exclusion criteria, above). This will aid comparison of the results of individual \neconomic evaluations with pooled estimates of effectiveness. In addition to this, we will also seek \ninformation on the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with each treatment strategy, \nand for different relevant health states noted.\nMore specifically, we will seek to identify any data on the QALY loss caused by GI cancer or \nGISTs, tumour progression, and adverse effects of the different treatment strategies.\nTypes of studies\nEconomic evaluations and cost analyses comparing the above mentioned alternative treatment \nstrategies will be included. Non-UK studies will also be included provided that they report \ninterventions or involve populations relevant to the scope of the study.\nSearch strategy for identification of published reports\nA comprehensive search will be undertaken to identify studies that assess the cost or cost-\neffectiveness of the alternative treatments used for GISTs. Databases to be searched will include \nMEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, SCI, Health Management Information Consortium, \nNHS EED, the HTA database, the Cost-effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry and the Research \nPapers in Economics (RePEc). There will be no language restriction and all databases will be \nsearched from 2000 onwards.\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011.

In addition, an Internet search using copernic agent will be undertaken \nand will include the websites of key professional organisations, GIST Support International and \nthe drug manufacturers Pfizer and Novartis.\nThe references lists of all identified studies and evidence syntheses, as well as submissions from \nindustry and other consultees, will be checked for additional potentially relevant references.\nThe description of how the industry submissions will be handled is described below [see \nHandling the company submission(s)].\nQuality assessment\nAll included studies will be assessed using the guidelines of the CRD.16 Modelling studies will also \nbe quality assessed against the Philips checklist.26\nReport methods for synthesising evidence of cost-effectiveness\nThe titles and abstracts of all published reports, literature and industry submissions identified by \nthe search strategy will be examined to select relevant studies. The full texts of potentially relevant \nreports, publications and industry submissions will be obtained and assessed in terms of their \nrelevance to the economic evaluation or cost analysis. Data will be extracted by an economist \naccording to the guidelines produced by the CRD for the critical appraisal of economic \nevaluations. Where the economic evaluation has been based on a modelling exercise, additional \ndata extraction criteria developed by Philips et al. will apply.26,27\nData from the included studies on economic analysis and economic evaluation will be \nsummarised in order to identify common results, and to summarise the variations and \nweaknesses between studies. The studies that use economic modelling will be critically reviewed \nwith regard to, for example, model structure use, parameterisation and how these models have \ndealt with uncertainty. This critical review will assist us in developing methods that can be used \nto structure our model.\nEconomic modelling\nModel structure\nThe structure of the model will be informed by the modelling studies identified as part of the \nsystematic review of economic evaluations, the review of clinical effectiveness and other existing \nevidence including previous NICE TARs. We will also draw upon advice from health-care \nprofessional members of our research team. However, the scope of the study suggests that \ntreatment strategies to be compared in the model are:\n1.  Treatment of GIST patients (whose disease has progressed on treatment with imatinib at \na dose of 400 mg per day) with an escalated dose of 600 mg per day, regulating symptoms \nwith BSC.\n2.  Treatment of GIST patients (whose disease has progressed on treatment with imatinib at \na dose of 400 mg per day) with an escalated dose of 800 mg per day, regulating symptoms \nwith BSC.\n3.  Treatment with sunitinib (within its recommended dose range), regulating symptoms \nwith BSC.\n4.  Regulating symptoms with BSC only.\nThe model will consider the above treatment strategies as different types of intervention, and will \nconsider the costs and consequences of patients following these different pathways of care. When \nbuilding the model we will also consider whether the use of FDG-PET to predict non-response 134 Appendix 7\nshould be built into the model. The inclusion of this imaging technology may alter estimates \nof cost-effectiveness because (1) it is costly and (2) it may provide an early indication of non-\nresponders who may benefit from the early introduction of an alternative therapy.\nConsideration will be given to estimating relative differences between treatments based on non-\ndirectly comparative data, if direct evidence is not identified within the literature.\nThe model used will be a Markov model, where the following health states will be considered (all \nare associated with clinical effectiveness): OS, treatment failure, time to tumour progression, and \nPFS. In an earlier HTA of imatinib at a dose of 400 mg per day,2 and other studies,28 the health \nstates within the economic model were (1) \u2018imatinib treatment\u2019 with different doses or \u2018sunitinib \ntreatment\u2019 that stops disease progression, or at least leads to a partial response (PR); (2) PD; and \n(3) death. It is likely that the health states used in our model will be similar to these analyses, \nalthough the final choice will depend upon advice and also the literature as described in the \nsection Economic evaluation. Where evidence is available, subgroup analysis will be undertaken \non patients with different gene mutation types that may affect their response to escalated doses \nof imatinib.\nData requirements\nFor our model, data on the relative effectiveness of interventions will be based upon the \nsystematic review. Resource use of the selected treatment strategies, and for baseline (patients \nwhose disease has progressed on treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg\/day), will be \nidentified from relevant sources (NHS cost data, NHS tariff), the review of economic evaluations \nand advice from experts. Data on resource use can generally be classified into different groups: \nfor example, resource use in the treatment strategy of the escalated doses of imatinib, secondary \ncare resource use related to secondary level of care or services other than the interventions, \nfor example side effect management and other associated treatments, laboratory and other \nexaminations, and resource use for other health care. Data\/information on unit costs will be \nobtained from NHS national reference costs and from studies that will be identified as described \nin the section entitled Economic evaluation. Additional focused searching for relevant cost data \nwill also be conducted.\nA cost\u2013utility analysis will be conducted, with outcomes estimated in terms of QALYs for \npatients, where the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) health-state profile can \nbe used from the information expected to be available from the review of economic evaluation \nstudies on such treatments. Each health state of the state transition model will require a utility \nestimated using the best available data [EQ-5D, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) \ncategory mapped to QALY]. These data will be identified from the systematic review, additional \nfocused searches and routine data sources. Where necessary we may need to make assumptions \nin order to use utility values derived from different patient populations.\nTime horizon for the model\nThe model will look at the costs and consequences directly attributable to the events occurring \nfor patients with GIST (whose disease progression takes place despite treatment with imatinib \nat 400 mg per day) and treating them with alternative strategies up to the end of the patient\u2019s \nlifetime. Although the time horizon used will be the patient\u2019s lifetime, it is expected that this is \nunlikely to exceed 6 years (the maximum number of years patients are expected to live after they \nare diagnosed with unresectable and\/or metastatic GISTs).\nAnalysis methods\nThe results of the model will be presented in terms of a cost\u2013consequence analysis and cost\u2013\nutility analysis. The cost\u2013consequence analysis will examine the costs and effects on natural \u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2011. This work was produced by Hislop et al. under the terms of a commissioning contract issued by the \nSecretary of State for Health.\n135   Health Technology Assessment 2011; Vol. 15: No. 25 DOI: 10.3310\/hta15250\nand clinical measures. The likely consequences that are expected to be included in the analysis \nwould include OS and PFS. In the cost\u2013utility analysis, results will be presented in terms of an \nincremental cost per QALY, incremental cost per OS (life-years gained) and incremental cost per \nmonths\/year of PFS.\nWhere appropriate, costs and outcomes will be discounted at 3.5% for both the cost\u2013consequence \nand cost\u2013utility analyses.27 The economic evaluation will consider the different subgroups \nnoted earlier.\nBoth deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis will be conducted for the uncertainty \nsurrounding parameters, and a net benefit framework will be used to compare the different \ntreatment strategies.\nHandling the company submission(s)\nInformation from the manufacturer will be considered if submitted in accordance with the \n3 December 2009 deadline set by NICE. Following receipt of the submission, members of the \nAberdeen TAR team will critically appraise sections of the report according to each member\u2019s \nown area of expertise. Studies reported in the manufacturer\u2019s submission that meet the inclusion \ncriteria for the review will be data extracted and quality assessed in accordance with the \nprocedures outlined in this protocol, and included in the data analysis.\nAny economic evaluations included in the company submission, provided they comply with \nNICE\u2019s guidance on presentation, will be assessed for clinical validity, reasonableness of \nassumptions and appropriateness of the data used in the economic model, again using the \nmethods outlined in this protocol. Strengths and weaknesses in terms of methodology adopted, \nreporting of results and conclusions will be described. The default position of the TAR team \nis that further modelling work will be necessary and if the TAR team judge that the existing \neconomic evidence is not robust then further work will be undertaken, either by adapting what \nalready exists or developing de novo modelling (as described in Economic modelling, above). The \nconclusions derived from the company submission may then be compared with those provided \nby the review of the other existing evidence and any model we develop so that differences in \nresults can be highlighted. If the model we may develop differs substantively from that submitted \nby any company, we shall justify any assumptions made.\nAny \u2018CiC\u2019 data taken from a company submission will be reported in accordance with \nNICE guidelines.\nCompeting interests of authors\nNone.\nReference list\n1.
