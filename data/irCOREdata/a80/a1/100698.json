INTRODUCTION\nHIGH-POWER short optical pulse amplification usingcladding-pumped rare-earth doped fibers draws a great\ndeal of interest for a variety of applications, e.g., in telecom-\nmunications, spectroscopy, materials processing and nonlinear\nfrequency conversion [1]. Much attention has been paid to\npulse amplification using normal dispersion doped fibers,\nwhere high-power parabolic pulses with a linear positive chirp\nacross their central region can be produced. Such pulses propa-\ngate self-similarly with reduced distortions, and are efficiently\nrecompressed into shorter duration using an anomalous disper-\nsion medium [2]. Furthermore, initially negative-chirped pulses\ncan be spectrally compressed in high-power doped fibers,\nto produce nearly transform-limited amplified pulses [3]. To\nthese ends, Yb -doped fiber amplifiers (YDFA), operating\nat a spectral range around 1.06 m, are particularly attractive.\nYDFAs provide very broad gain bandwidth, high conversion\nefficiencies, and are relatively free of excited-state absorption\nand concentration quenching by ion-ion interactions [4].\nMost theoretical works that discuss pulse amplification in\nYDFAs are based on the generalized nonlinear Schroedinger\nequation (NLSE) for the complex envelope of the amplified\npulse [5]\u2013[8]. Our goal in this contribution is twofold. First,\nwe demonstrate the advantages of the simultaneous analysis of\nthe spectral and temporal dependency of a propagating pulse\nin high-power, cladding-pumped YDFAs [9]. We recently used\nthis approach to analyze relatively broad-bandwidth incident\nManuscript received January 29, 2007; revised April 26, 2007.\nE. Yahel and O.

Second, we extend previous works on pulsed YDFAs\nand describe numerical calculations using parameters that were\nnot considered in detail before, such as the pulse wavelength,\npulse peak power, Yb concentration, pump filling factor, fiber\nlength, pumping configuration and pump power.\nThis contribution is organized as follows. In Section II, we\npresent the set of coupled rate-propagation equations for high-\npower pulsed YDFAs. In Section III, we show some numer-\nical examples for ultrashort pulse amplification in high-power\nYDFAs, and consider the effect of various important design\nparameters on the amplified pulse shape. We also demonstrate\nspectral compression of an incident negative-chirped pulse. Our\nconclusions are discussed in Section IV. In Appendix A, we dis-\ncuss the main assumptions leading to a spectrally resolved pulse\npropagation equation, whereas in Appendix B, we provide the\nfinite difference scheme we used to solve the rate-propagation\nequations.\nII. THEORETICAL MODEL\nWe consider a double-clad fiber geometry of length , where\nthe fiber core is uniformly doped with Yb ions of concentra-\ntion . The pump power at wavelength is\ncoupled into the area of the first cladding (which includes the\ncore), at either fiber ends. Thus, the pump propagates along the\nforward (positive) or the backward (negative) directions, with\nan effective power filling factor . Pump photons are absorbed\nby the Yb ions in the ground state, exciting them to\nthe state [4]. The ASE power densities that are\nemitted and amplified due to the Yb ions transitions, propa-\ngate in both the positive and negative direction. We assume\nthat due to specialized fiber bending techniques, the amplifica-\ntion of high order modes in the core is practically suppressed. In\nthat case, the wavelength-dependent power filling factor is\napproximated by the ratio of the modal power that is am-\nplified in the core, to the total modal power [12].\nThe pulse spectral power density per unit wavelength\n, is injected into the fiber at , and propagates\nin the forward direction. We assume that the pulse power is\nstrong enough to modify the population distribution of both the\nYb ions and host glass molecules. The power carried by the\npump and ASE is much weaker than the pulse power, thus we\nrestrict its effect to the Yb transitions. We further assume\nthat the atomic population within each Yb energy manifold\nis in thermal equilibrium, and thus the gain-induced refractive\nindex changes can be approximated using the Kramers\u2013Kronig\n0018-9197\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

We note that in\npractice the thermalization rate within each manifold depends\nto a large extent on the properties of the glass host, as well\nas on other conditions such as the temperature [14]. Thus, the\nextent to which the Yb population deviates from thermal\nequilibrium during the pulse propagation requires further exper-\nimental validation. To be on the safe side, however, we consider\nhere pulses with duration 200 fs [14]. We also neglect the\nnearly wavelength-independent small index contribution from\nultraviolet absorption to higher-order energy levels [16]. Under\nthese assumptions, the bulk refractive index that includes\nboth linear and nonlinear contributions is given by\n(1)\nwhere is the (linear) refractive index of the passive fiber, and\nthe nonlinear contribution is given by [13], [17]\n(2)\nHere, is the nonlinear index, and is the envelope of\nthe fundamental mode in the radial direction along the\nfiber cross-section. We assume that is weakly depen-\ndent on the wavelength within the spectral band of the pulse,\nand that it is normalized to satisfy . The\nfunction denotes the Kramers\u2013Kronig transform of the\ncross section between levels and , and is\nthe atomic population of the excited manifold. We note\nthat the index changes in (2) are assumed to be small, so that\ntheir effect on the modal envelope can be neglected. The\nnonlinear contribution to the refractive index induces disper-\nsion and chirping of the propagating pulse. Further, the pulse is\namplified, absorbed, and scattered along the optical fiber, due to\nthe Yb transitions and Rayleigh scattering. These effects can\nbe included in a unified manner in a spectrally resolved propa-\ngation equation for the pulse power density, i.e., by considering\nthe rate of change in the number of photons along the fiber, and\nthe photons equation of motion [18]\u2013[20]. Here, we assume that\nspatial perturbations in the refractive index along the propaga-\ntion direction are small. We also assume that the pulse is short\nenough to justify neglecting the effect of transients in the pump\npower and ASE spectral densities powers on the Yb popula-\ntion during the pulse propagation. Under these assumptions, we\nobtain the following set of propagation equations for the pulse\nspectral power density , ASE spectral power density\n, and the pump power , respectively (see Ap-\npendix A)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\nIn (3),\nand is the speed of light in vacuum. The effective\nrefractive index of the fundamental\nmode in the core is the sum of the linear passive con-\ntribution and the\nnonlinear gain-induced contribution\n.\nThe function is\nthe corresponding effective group velocity of the pulse spec-\ntral component at wavelength . The term\nis the\neffective local gain, where represents an effective loss\nterm due to scattering and fiber coiling. Other terms in (3)\u2013(5)\nare the nonlinearity coefficient , where\nis an effective core area [21], and the functions and\nthat represent the steady state distributions of the\nexcited state population and the effective local gain,\nrespectively. The term denotes the contri-\nbution of spontaneous emission into a mode, where the factor\nof two takes into account the possible orthogonal polarization\ndirections [22]. Here we assume that spontaneous emission\nis generated into all modes supported by the fiber [23]. It\nis worth mentioning the difference in the interpretation of the\npulse energy distribution as derived from (3), i.e., ,\nand the pulse complex envelope as calculated from the solution\nof the generalized NLSE [21]. In particular, the pulse power, i.e.,\n, and the pulse spectrum, i.e., ,\nthat we calculate, represent the projections of many spectrally\ndependent temporal envelopes of the pulse energy components,\nand they are not derived from a Fourier transform. Furthermore,\nit is clear that our approach cannot describe some of the wave\nproperties of the pulse, e.g., as manifested in the contribution\nof different phases to a nonlinearity-generated pulse spectral\ncomponent [21], [24]. However, frequency mixing of the pulse\nspectral components is properly considered in our formalism.\nThe quasi-three-level Yb system is assumed to have two\nenergy manifolds [4]. Hence, the excited population, ,\nsatisfies the following rate equation:\n(6)\nwhere is the lifetime of the Yb excited state. The\nterms and in (6) represent stimulated absorption and\nemission rates, respectively, and depend on the pump power,\npulse power, and ASE power emitted by the Yb ions.

Furthermore, the pulse bandwidth\naround the central wavelength is divided into channels of\nwidth nm. Equations (3)\u2013(6) are initially solved\nassuming steady state conditions without pulse injection [i.e.,\nand ]. To this end, we integrate the\nequations iteratively along the forward and backward propaga-\ntion direction, until the overall power channels converge. For\nthe time dependent pulse propagation, we use a finite difference\nscheme with two staggered grids for the photons and the ions\npopulations. The numerical solution of (3) is considerably sim-\nplified by transforming the equation into a retarded time frame\nmoving with a constant reference group velocity . Thus, we\ndefine a reduced time , so that (3) becomes\n(8)\nEquations (8) and (6) are solved numerically using an implicit\nupwind finite-difference scheme, with an iterative algorithm to\nsolve the coupled pulse spectral components at each spatial and\ntemporal step (cf. Appendix B) [25]. We note that the numer-\nical stability of this scheme depends on the pulse power at the\nboundaries of the spectral window, which has to be sufficiently\nsmall in order to ensure that the effects of numerical reflections\nfrom these boundaries are negligible. To this end, we employed\na large enough spectral window with strongly absorbing spec-\ntral boundaries.\nIII. EXAMPLES\nIn order to analyze high-power pulse amplification in\nYDFAs, we consider several examples near the 1060-nm tran-\nsition. Unless otherwise mentioned, the parameters assumed\nin the numerical calculations correspond to the experimental\nYDFA described in [1], [5] and are summarized in Table I.\nThe effective linear index contribution is calculated\nbased on the waveguide dispersion relations [12], taking into\naccount Sellmeier\u2019s equation for silica host [21]. We also\nassume that the pump power W is injected at ,\ni.e., counter-propagating to the incident pulse, and that it\nprovides approximately 32-dB gain at 1060 nm. Based on\nthese assumptions, we calculated the spectrum of the fiber\ndispersion parameter, i.e.,\n(cf. Fig. 1). We note that due to the strong gain-induced con-\ntribution, the fiber dispersion fluctuates strongly at a spectral\nrange near nm, where the fiber becomes strongly\nabsorbing. In the spectral range relevant to optical amplifica-\ntion, i.e., at nm (see inset), the dispersion\nis normal, and it monotonically increases from to\nps km nm . Thus, gain-induced dispersion\nfluctuations are expected to have only small effect on an ampli-\nfied pulse, in contrast to Er -doped fibers [10].\nTABLE I\nPARAMETERS USED IN THE NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS\nFig. 1. Dependence of the fiber dispersion parameter (D) on the wavelength.\nThe inset shows the spectrum of the integrated fiber gain, i.e., G(0; L; \u0015) \u0011\nexp[ g dz].\nIn what follows, we demonstrate the effects of various phys-\nical parameters on the spectral and temporal characteristics of a\nshort amplified pulse. In particular, we study within the frame-\nwork of our model the effects of the incident pulse wavelength,\npulse peak power, Yb concentration, pump filling factor, fiber\nlength, pumping configuration, pump power and the nonlinear\nindex. Unless stated otherwise, we assume throughout this paper\nthat the incident pulse spectral power density distribution, i.e.,\n, is given by the Wigner function of a chirp-free\nGaussian pulse centered at , with width [full-width at\nhalf-maximum (FWHM)] of fs, and peak power of\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Amplified pulse energy spectrum, i.e., P (z = L; t; \u0015)dt (normal-\nized), as function of the wavelength, for incident pulses with different central\nwavelengths \u0015 in the range 1020\u20131080 nm.\n214 W [26]. Thus, the incident pulse is transform-limited,\nwith a bandwidth of 6 nm.\nIn Fig. 2 we depict the dependence of the amplified pulse\nspectrum on the wavelength, for different incident pulse cen-\ntral wavelengths . We note that on shifting the incident pulse\nwavelength from 1020 to 1080 nm, the amplified pulse\nspectrum changes its shape due to the nonuniformity of the gain\n(cf. Fig. 1). The spectral broadening of the amplified pulse is\na consequence of the nonlinearity-induced chirp, which in turn\ndepends on the pulse power through (2). Thus, spectral broad-\nening is most significant for a pulse incident near the gain peak\nwavelength, e.g., at nm. It is worth to mention,\nhowever, that the amplified spectrum of a weak pulse is pre-\ndominantly affected by gain narrowing [10]. We note that the\npulse gain is relatively small in the short tail of the gain spec-\ntrum, e.g., for nm, and hence spectral broadening\nis also small. Our results also show that in the moderate gain\nregime, e.g., for the case nm, the amplified spectrum\nis relatively flat shaped with steep edges. The corresponding de-\npendence of the amplified pulse power on the delay time with\nrespect to the arrival of the pulse peak is depicted in Fig. 3.\nHere we also show the amplified pulse mean wavelength, i.e.,\n[26], as function\nof the time delay. We note that the amplified pulse broadens in\ntime due to propagation in the normal dispersion regime, and\nthat the wavelength chirp is positive during the arrival time of\nthe main part of the amplified pulse (i.e., the mean pulse fre-\nquency increases during that time). The wavelength chirp is ap-\nproximately linear across the nm pulse, where the\namplified pulse shape is nearly parabolic. On the other hand, the\nwavelength chirp deviates from linearity close to the gain-peak\nwavelength (e.g., for nm). Thus, we conclude that\na deviation of the amplified pulse spectrum from flatness (cf.\nFig. 2) corresponds to a nonlinear pulse chirp [6].\nFig. 4 shows the spectrum and power of an amplified pulse\nfor different incident pulse peak powers.

On\nincreasing the peak power, e.g., 340 W, the effect of fiber non-\nlinearity is enhanced and the amplified pulse spectrum broadens\nsignificantly, in agreement with experimental measurements\nunder similar conditions [1], [5]. In particular, we note that\nthe asymmetries in the pulse spectra are consequence of the\ninclusion of a realistic gain term in (3), whereas theoretical\nmodels that are based on a more simplified approach to the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The lines represent a B-spline\ninterpolation of the exact numerical solution.\ndopant transitions predict a perfectly symmetric spectrum, e.g.,\nsee [5]. On further increasing the peak power, e.g., 490 W,\nthe amplified spectrum is strongly reshaped due to the finite\ngain bandwidth [Fig. 4(a)]. In this regime, the amplified pulse\npower deviates asymmetrically from a parabolic shape, and\nis characterized by the much longer leading edge [Fig. 4(b)].\nThis reshaping is a consequence of an increase in the group\nindex at the pulse peak power, which enhances the generation\nof blue-shifted spectral components.\nNext, we consider the effect of the Yb concentration on\nthe amplified pulse characteristics. Fig. 5 shows the amplified\npulse spectral width, as function of the Yb concentration, for\ndifferent values of the effective pump filling factor. Depending\non the Yb concentration, the spectral width of the amplified\npulse is maximized where the gain is also maximized. Further\nincreasing the Yb concentration results in a decrease of the\namplified pulse power due to absorption losses, and hence to\nreduced spectral broadening of the amplified pulse. Our results\ndemonstrate that in the limit of small Yb concentrations, in-\ncreasing the pump filling factor (e.g., by coiling the fiber to en-\nhance pump absorption efficiency [27]) broadens the spectral\nwidth of the output pulse. We also find that there is a positive\ncorrelation between the dependency of the pulse temporal width\non the Yb concentration and the corresponding dependency\nof the spectral width, as the former depends on the differences\nin the group velocities of the pulse spectral components. These\ndifferences, in turn, tend to increase with the spectral redistribu-\ntion of the pulse energy due to the nonlinearity-induced chirp.\nFig. 6 shows the amplified pulse power and pulse spectrum as\nfunction of the fiber length (for ). We note that on\nincreasing the fiber length, the amplified pulse temporal width\ncontinuously increases due to the dispersion of the pulse spec-\ntral components. There is an optimum fiber length, for a given\npump power, at which the amplified pulse peak power is maxi-\nmized, e.g., at m [Fig. 6(a)]. This peak power, in turn, also\nmaximizes nonlinear effects. Thus, the amplified pulse spectrum\nbroadens as long as the fiber length is shorter than this optimum\nlength, and it narrows for longer lengths while the pulse energy\nFig. 6. Dependence of the amplified pulse intensity on the fiber length (L), as\nfunction of (a) the time delay and (b) the wavelength.\nis redistributed towards the edges of the spectrum [Fig. 6(b)]. We\nalso find that the amplified pulse characteristics depend on the\npumping configuration. For example, the amplified pulse spec-\ntral and temporal widths are somewhat larger in a copropagating\nconfiguration, in particular in the limit of long fibers (e.g.,\nm). We attribute this result to the spatial distribution of the\npopulation inversion in a copropagating configuration, which is\nmaximized near . Thus, an incident pulse encounters rel-\natively high gain, which, in turn, results in a bigger product of\npulse power and propagation distance, and hence stronger non-\nlinear effects. It should be also noted that losses to stimulated\nRaman scattering (which are neglected in this work) ultimately\nlimit the optimum fiber length below some critical length that de-\npends on the incident pulse peak power and on the fiber gain [28].\nAn all important parameter in our model is the numerical\nvalue of the nonlinear index . The value of this parameter de-\npends on the properties of the glass host, and its measured value\nin silica glass varies significantly [21]. In order to examine the\neffect of on our results, we artificially changed its value be-\ntween to m W [21]. In Fig. 7 we\ndepict the amplified pulse output energy as function of the in-\njected pump power, for two values of . We note that the output\npulse energy saturates, more significantly for higher (i.e.,\nm W ). This saturation is a consequence\nof the finite gain bandwidth of the Yb ions, which limits the\nbandwidth of the amplified pulse, and hence its output energy\n[5], [29]. The amplified pulse bandwidth, in turn, depends on\nthe nonlinearity-induced chirp, and it increases with the pump\npower [30], and with the value of (see inset). The effect\nof on the amplified pulse is most significant at high pump\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:06 from IEEE Xplore.

In that regime, the am-\nplified pulse spectrum is severely deformed, its chirp strongly\ndeviates from linearity, and the pulse recompression efficiency\nis degraded [5]. It is clear that the saturation exhibited here can\nbe removed by reducing the peak power of the incident pulse\n(cf. Fig. 4), e.g., by using gratings to stretch the pulse before\namplification [1].\nFinally, we demonstrate the amplification of an initially\nchirped pulse. To this end, we assume that the incident\nGaussian pulse is stretched to ps, and its peak power\nis correspondingly reduced to 6 W. This stretching, in turn,\ninduced a pulse chirp, e.g., (see [26, eq. (5.15)]).\nFig. 8(a) depicts the incident chirped pulse spectral power den-\nsity distribution as function of the wavelength and time delay,\nwhereas Fig. 8(b)\u2013(d) shows the corresponding amplified pulse\nspectral power density, for different pump powers. For low\npump powers, e.g., W, the gain and hence the nonlin-\nearity-induced chirp are relatively small, having only moderate\neffect on the amplified pulse [Fig. 8(b)]. Further increasing\nthe pump power, e.g., W, the induced positive chirp\ncancels the initial chirp over the pulse central region, producing\nsignificant spectral compression [see Fig. 8(c)]. This result\nis in qualitative agreement with experimental measurements\n[3], and it is the key for achieving transform-limited amplified\npulses. On further increasing the pump power, e.g., W,\nthe core of the amplified pulse becomes positively chirped,\nresulting in somewhat broadening of the output spectrum\n[Fig. 8(d)]. We note that for the calculated pulse parameters\nthere is only a small decrease in the compression ratio of the\noutput pulse duration with increasing pump power. We thus\nconclude that there is an optimum pump power for achieving\nan amplified pulse with the smallest time\u2013bandwidth product.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we analyzed ultrashort pulse amplification in\nhigh-power YDFAs using the numerical solution of a time-de-\npendent, spectrally resolved pulse propagation equation. We\ndemonstrated the dependence of the amplified pulse energy\nspectrum and pulse power on the pulse wavelength and peak\npower. It was shown that an efficient amplification of linear\nwavelength chirped parabolic pulses can be achieved with a\nlimited incident pulse peak power and by tuning the incident\npulse wavelength to the longer tail of the gain spectrum. On\nthe other hand, the amplified pulse spectral width increases\non increasing the incident pulse peak power or on tuning the\nincident pulse wavelength towards the gain-peak wavelength.\nThis broadening, in turn, distorts the amplified pulse shape,\nand degrades the linear wavelength chirp. We also found that\nthe spectral width of the amplified pulse can be controlled by\nproperly choosing the Yb concentration and the effective\npump filling factor. In particular, for a given fiber properties,\nthere exists an Yb concentration value that maximizes the\nspectral bandwidth of the amplified pulse. This value tends to\nbe smaller for more efficiently absorbing fibers. We calculated\nan optimum fiber length for which the amplified pulse peak\npower is maximized, its spectrum is relatively flattened, and its\nwavelength chirp is approximately linear. For fibers longer than\nthis optimum, the pulse energy redistributes towards the spectral\nwings and the wavelength chirp deviates from linearity, while\nshorter fibers are less efficient. For sufficiently increased pump\npower, the amplified pulse energy saturates since its spectral\nbandwidth is limited by the finite gain bandwidth of Yb ions.\nThis saturation is only weakly dependent on the measured values\nof the nonlinear index of silica glass. We also demonstrated that\nby tuning the pump power, the amount of spectral compression\nof a negative-chirp incident pulse can be controlled. Our results\nprovide additional support to experimental measurements of\nbroad-bandwidth amplified pulses, which extends the standard\nNLSE formalism and can, in principle, be compared directly\nwith the pulse spectrogram [10]. Furthermore, the model allows\nthe inclusion of a realistic gain spectrum for the Stark-splitted\ndoped ions transitions using measured cross sections, therefore\nalleviating some of the restrictions imposed by analytical gain\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

With some minor modifications, the model\npresented herein can be also employed to other types of doped\nfibers, as well as to different incident pulse shapes.\nAPPENDIX A\nSPECTRALLY RESOLVED PROPAGATION EQUATION\nPhoton transfer in a general dispersive, isotropic medium,\nwhose properties can also change in time and space, was consid-\nered in detail in the framework of radiative transfer theory [19],\n[20]. Here we apply this theory to model pulse amplification\nalong an YDFA. We define the distribution function\nof photons that propagate in the forward direction along the\nfiber such that is the number of photons at time in dif-\nferential volume element , in frequency interval , centered\nat . The number of photons change in time as the photons\nstream along the fiber, due to the interaction of photons with the\nYb ions and the glass host molecules, e.g., due to stimulated\nemission, absorption, and scattering of photons. Thus, we have\nthe following balance equation\n(A1)\nwhere\nis the local gain per unit length, which\nincludes the dopant contribution and scattering losses .\nThe function is the distribution of photons that\ncontribute to spontaneous emission into one mode, is the\neffective number of transverse fiber modes and\ndenotes the photons group velocity in the fiber. Following some\nalgebraic manipulations, it is straightforward to obtain [20]\n(A2)\nIntroducing the optical intensity per unit bandwidth\n, representing a time-frequency distribution\nof an amplified pulse along the fiber [9], and making use of the\nderivative along the propagation path, i.e., ,\nallows us to write (A2) as\n(A3)\nwhere is the spontaneous emission inten-\nsity per unit bandwidth into one mode. We note that the photon\nequation of motion can be written as [19]\n(A4)\nwhere the bulk refractive index is given explicitly by\n[13], [17]\n(A5)\nSubstituting (A4) into (A3) and making use of the explicit form\nof the group velocity, i.e., ,\nwe derive the following equation for the rate of change in the\npulse intensity per unit bandwidth along the fiber\n(A6)\nWe note that for an effectively single-mode pulse propaga-\ntion, radiation modes can be ignored. Assuming that only the\nmodal gain varies in the propagation direction, we define the\npower density per unit bandwidth, , by\n(A7)\nWe also assume\n(A8)\nwhere is the contribution of spontaneous emis-\nsion into the mode [22]. Substituting (A5), (A7), and (A8) into\n(A6), and integrating over the entire transverse cross section,\nwe obtain (3) in the text for the spectral power density. We note\nthat this procedure essentially assumes that the effective index\ncontributions in (3) can be calculated based on the variation the-\norem. Similarly, we derive steady-state expressions for the ASE\nspectral power densities and the pump power, given by (4) and\n(5), respectively, where we also assume forward and backward\npropagation.\nAPPENDIX B\nFINITE-DIFFERENCE SCHEME\nTo solve (8), we assume equally spaced intervals along\nthe axis with spatial grid points\n, equally spaced spectral intervals with wave-\nlength grid points ,\nand a temporal grid .\nHere, is the lower limit wavelength of the spectral window.\nWe employ different, staggered, grids for the photons and ions\nequations, i.e., (8) and (6), which are half time step and\nhalf spatial step shifted with respect to each-other.
