The argument of this paper is that many such \napproaches, which conceive a bond in terms of shared interests, cultural attributes, or shared values and \nprinciples, are liable either to underplay or to overplay how much the citizens of a polity must have in common, \ntending either to empty public life of the pursuit of shared ends or conversely to downgrade the importance of \nadversarialism.  Both may be seen as depoliticising moves.  The paper goes on to explore how a more explicitly \npolitical bond, based on the appraisal of political problems, might be conceived for a European polity.   \n \n \n\u2018To constitute and give life to a body politic is to put some things in common.  [\u2026]  The problem of \nthe Europeans is that they do not know what they want to put in common.\u2019  This is how Pierre Manent \ncharacterises some of the uncertainty surrounding the EU (Manent 2006, p.67).  As with all polities, so \nin the European case it seems that a sense of the common is required to animate the institutional forms \nthat are emerging.  The EU is widely taken to be a self-standing polity of some kind (Walker 2002), \nand despite the openness of the future trajectory of its institutional forms, some basis on which to \nconceive of it as a political community seems necessary.  Yet the \u2018common\u2019 is an ambiguous thing.  \nHow one could conceptualise it, as a matter of description, and how one should conceptualise it, as a \nnormative matter, are both issues of some dispute.  Ongoing scholarly debate in recent years about the \npossibility of a European demos has involved a variety of attempts to pin down the common, to give \nshape to something indeterminate.  The current touch of crisis about the EU, while it has quietened the \nsense of a transformative constitutional moment, keeps the question of the common returning to the \nfore. \n It is useful to distinguish between two ways in which this question can be formulated.  One is \nto treat it as a membership or boundary question concerning who is to be included in the political \ncommunity and who may be properly excluded.  In the contemporary European case this might be a \nmatter both of the territorial extension of the Union and of the citizenship rights granted to temporary \nand long-term residents.  A second is to treat it as a question of the cohesiveness of a unit one takes as \ngiven.  In this perspective the precise extension of the EU\u2019s boundaries remains an unsettled matter, \nbut it is assumed that \u2013 wherever they be located \u2013 they require the support of some kind of integrative \nforce to ensure the stability of the polity and the endorsement of its citizens.  A collective bond is \n 2 \nrequired in order to conjure the unity of \u2018the people\u2019 such that they are suited to rule through the same \ninstitutions.   \n While both formulations of the question raise issues of political importance, one should avoid \nassuming that any answer to the second question is valid to the extent that it provides a clear answer to \nthe first.  A fruitful conceptualisation of the collective bond need not specify where the boundaries of \nthat collective are to lie, since this will be a matter of ongoing interpretation.  Membership clearly \ncannot be resolved by a straightforward appeal to democratic decision-making, to an aggregation of \nindividual votes, since as Robert Goodin puts it, \u2018that is like saying the winning lottery ticket will be \npulled out of the hat by the winner of that selfsame lottery.\u2019 (Goodin 2007, p.43)  Nor do appeals to \nthe principle of \u2018all affected interests\u2019, or \u2018all probably affected interests\u2019, suggest a solution, since \nthen there are problems of who can authoritatively judge such questions.  Appeals to cultural markers \nor geographical features simply beg the question of which should properly be invoked (Dahl 1990; \nWhelan 1983).  Given that \u2018the people\u2019 can never be captured in a single representation that fits neatly \nto the material world (Laclau 2005), the membership question is never fully resolved, and for that \nreason one may find value in conceptualisations of the collective bond which remain open on the \nquestion of boundaries. \n Reflections on how to conceptualise a European common can sometimes seem like academic \ndebate at its most detached.   The debate may seem like an artifice of words: one agonises about the \n\u2018demos\u2019 because one has spent too long thinking about the etymology of \u2018democracy\u2019.  There are \nseveral senses in which the debate is of importance though.  Firstly, insofar as any democratic regime \nis based on the principle of rule by \u2018the people\u2019, it is an issue of basic constitutional significance how \none makes sense of this term.  In the absence of a monarch embodying the unity of the whole in his or \nher person, what defines \u2018the people\u2019 and holds them together as the authors of political authority \nbecomes a necessary subject of ongoing ideological debate.  As Claude Lefort puts it, in a democracy \n\u2018the locus of power becomes an empty place,\u2019 and the representation of \u2018the people\u2019 as a single entity \nis dependent upon political and sociological elaboration (Lefort 1988, pp.17-8).  Secondly, how this \nidea of \u2018the people\u2019 comes to be represented has implications for the day-to-day practice of politics.  \nLife in a polity inevitably requires certain constraints on negative liberty, and how one conceptualises \nthe common goes some way to determining how citizens are to \u2018make sense\u2019 of this fact, even if \nlargely at a tacit level.  In many perspectives, some kind of meta-identity is required if citizens are to \naccept the rule of law when they would rather not, or to accept decision-making when it runs counter \nto their perceptions of self-interest.  Institutions need justifications if they are not to be exited or \nignored, something perhaps especially true for an emerging polity such as the EU, where the habit of \naccepting decision-making is less entrenched and where a few expressions of dissatisfaction can have \n 3 \ndestabilising consequences.  How the common is conceptualised can also shape what citizens \nunderstand by the common good, or whether they doubt the existence of such a thing, and the extent to \nwhich they seek participation in the political process.  Also, while no conceptualisation of the common \ncan provide a settled answer to the question of boundaries, nonetheless different conceptualisations \ncan serve to naturalise certain boundaries while problematising others.  Why it is logical for \u2018us\u2019 to \nshare a certain political arrangement depends crucially on how that \u2018we\u2019 is defined.   \n Rather than simply a classificatory matter, how one conceptualises the common says much \nabout the models of democracy to which one wants to lend credence.  One\u2019s perspective is laden with \nconsequences for how one understands the purpose of the polity and the nature of citizenship, and how \none understands the challenges which a particular polity or polities in general may face.  It may point \ntowards certain kinds of institutional configuration or \u2018regime\u2019 rather than others.  To suggest what \nEuropeans might put in common is at the same time to suggest a vision of politics for the EU.  \nLikewise any vision of how a polity should look is going to involve, explicitly or implicitly, a position \nbeing taken on what it is that holds the political community together.  A debate on the nature of the \ncommon is embedded in all discussion of the political, and the implications of different positions are \ntherefore an appropriate target of inquiry. \n The following section examines some of the ways in which the common tends to be conceived \nin the European debate, drawing as these do on older traditions in political philosophy.  There are \nnumerous criteria by which one could distinguish them \u2013 a logical one would be historical lineage, \ncharting their links to liberalism, communitarianism and republicanism; another would be the \ndistinction between those seeking the common in the material world and those treating it as a symbolic \nconstruction or a feature of social practices.  Here they are analysed according to how \u2018thick\u2019 they \nsuppose the common must be.  By this is meant the level of regularity across the citizen body which is \ndemanded: a thick, maximalist approach supposes a high degree of regularity such that, following \nwhatever principle is invoked, citizens resemble one another rather strongly, whether in the attributes \nthey display or the ends they pursue.  A thin, minimalist approach allows for greater diversity, albeit \npotentially at some expense to the cohesiveness of the political community.   \n Both maximalist and minimalist conceptions of the common may have unwelcome \nimplications for the democratic character of the political community.  From a broadly pluralist \nperspective, one may argue that an important element in any healthy democracy is political \ncontestation.  Where no single viewpoint can claim absolute validity, handling matters of common \nconcern involves the identification and the making of choices, many of which will be contestable.  The \ndemocratic process is what allows the range of competing political perspectives to be voiced and \ndiscussed, and its success depends upon there being active and inclusive public debate, combined with \n 4 \nwidespread recognition that, due to the contestability of viewpoints, the outcome may be reasonable \ndisagreement.  The system should invite citizens to be oriented to this debate, and to the opportunities \nprovided by democratic institutions to shape decision-making on matters of common concern, so that \nwidely held viewpoints are not systematically excluded.  Yet it may be argued that many of the \nexisting approaches to a European common, more or less minimalist or maximalist in their demands, \nare adverse in their implications for political contestation and involvement, and rather of a \n\u2018depoliticising\u2019 tendency.  Having laid out arguments to this effect, the need for an alternative \nconception is advocated.  It is suggested that this should have two features in particular: one is an \nemphasis on adversarialism, which implies subgroups of citizens tied to one another by specific \ncommon purposes without this presupposing a high degree of regularity and consensus across the \nwhole citizen body; the second is an emphasis on substantive problems, which may foster an engaged \ncitizenry by allowing a close link to be maintained to the everyday concerns of ordinary citizens.  \nThese guiding principles point to the elaboration of what one may call a \u2018political bond\u2019. \n \n \nMinimalist, Maximalist, and Mixed Conceptions of the Common \n \nA staple idea of political philosophy is that material interests may serve as the collective bond.  This \nperspective can be thought of as the default position in the older literature on the EU.  In the \n1940s\/50s, the populations of European nation-states were seen as overtly hostile to one another, and it \nwas widely assumed that any moves towards integration would have to quieten their passions by \nappealing to their interests.  In the early post-War years these interests were understood by many as \nsecurity interests, implying a security bond based on the need to establish peace between European \nstates.  More commonly, once the early federalist visions had faded, an economic perspective was \nadvanced.  With arguments redolent of the older notion of \u2018doux commerce\u2019 (Hirschman 1996), it was \nsuggested that integration and polity formation could be advanced by enabling the pursuit of interests \nthrough commercial exchange.  The deepening of market interaction and functional integration was \nviewed as establishing a commercial bond between elites, leading to wider economic benefits for the \nmember-state populations as a whole, who in turn would come to see their prosperity as entwined with \nthat of their neighbours (Monnet 1963).  While this perspective was most common in the pre-\nMaastricht era, it survives amongst those who treat the common market and the establishment of \neconomic and monetary union as the principal features of the European polity.   \n In descriptive-empirical terms, there are valid reasons to doubt whether a bond based on \ninterests, security or commercial, is sufficient to constitute a political community.  To conceive the \n 5 \ncollective bond for a European polity in these terms is to suggest that interests favour the integration \nprocess unambiguously.  Yet interests are rarely unambiguous: they can generally be appraised in \nmultiple ways, and are susceptible to redescription.  An appeal to long-term interests such as security \nand economic growth is always vulnerable to counter-claims that conjure short-term or non-material \ninterests, since what may be said to be in someone\u2019s interests depends crucially on how alternatives \nare defined (Connolly 1974a).  Interests are comparative, and therefore depend on ideational \nelaboration, which means any interest-based account of social order centred on pre-interpretational \nfactors alone will be incomplete.  If the empirical argument is inconclusive, for this reason one can \ntake a critical approach to the normative implications of accepting such a position.  As critics of \naggregationist models of politics have emphasised, a perspective which takes interests as self-evident \nis likely to accord a minimal role to political debate and contestation as a means by which to elaborate \nthose interests and seek an interpretation of the common good (Sunstein 1991).  If political ends are \ngiven, citizens have little need to engage one another in an effort to define them: they need only \ndelegate a small number of representatives to act on their behalf and execute the policies necessary to \nrealising them.  While such a perspective may continue to acknowledge \u2018the people\u2019 as the ultimate \nsource of authority, there is little room for \u2018the people\u2019 as active agents engaged in collective decision-\nmaking and self-rule (Elster 1986).  Indeed, attempts to exercise democratic control over the \nmanagement of these interests are liable to be portrayed as constraints on efficiency.  It follows as \nlittle surprise that a commercial perspective tends to be suspicious of activity which cannot be \nunderstood in terms of the pursuit of individual advantage, and tends to admire citizens most when \nthey act in private competition.   \n Naturally, such observations are not to imply that political theory should do away with the \nconcept of interest: there may be ways to formulate it in less determinist terms such that it can be a \nstarting-point for sustained political debate (Connolly 1974a).  If one acknowledges the fundamental \nambiguity of interests, one makes space for citizens to be active in the articulation of different \nperspectives, and to seek common cause in the attempt to advance these.  But it is exactly this type of \nreading that one excludes by supposing one can separate out a set of concerns prior to political debate \nand regard these as the basis of the collective bond.  To treat interests in this way as constitutive of the \ndemos is a depoliticising move, likely to weaken public debate and to exacerbate wider trends in \ncontemporary democracy towards the marginalisation of the principle of democratic control.   \n \n Reacting against this minimalist conceptualisation of the common, in which citizens tend \nweakly to mutual engagement, a quite different perspective instead plays up the importance of cultural \nattachments extending widely across the citizen body.  In this maximalist conception of the common, \n 6 \nit is held that political units require the support of a cultural bond.   Historically, there have been two \nmajor ways to conceive such a bond: as involving ethical ties that constitute \u2018the people\u2019 as an organic \nunity extended through time, or as involving contingent ties which serve only the instrumental purpose \nof evoking a sense of commonality, solidarity and trust within the population.  Both versions invoke \nmarkers such as territory, language, symbolic practices, blood ties, historical events and feelings of \nbelonging, though granting them a rather different status (Parekh 1995).  The first perspective, \npromoted notably by the Romantic nationalist movements of the nineteenth century, has been rare in \nthe literature on the EU, though it finds expression in discussion of Christianity\u2019s significance for the \nUnion and in the more enthusiastic references to Europe\u2019s \u2018common civilisation\u2019 and \u2018common \nheritage\u2019 (Delanty 2002).  The latter perspective, which deserves closer attention, presents itself as \nopen and pragmatic, making no strong normative assumptions about the proper nature of common ties.  \nRather than essentialising a certain set of inherited attributes, it sees the community as bound by \nwhatever combination of attributes its citizens may share and, importantly, believe or can be \nconvinced that they share (Miller 2000).  The community is in this sense \u2018imagined\u2019 rather than real, \nand since no outward markers are given a priori significance this approach generally marks a turn \ntowards people\u2019s goals, beliefs and feelings. \n Without prizing any one conception of cultural commonality, such a perspective seems to posit \na level of homogeneity either rather unrealistic for today\u2019s Europe or, were one to take it seriously, \nrepressive of those who do not easily conform to it.  There is a danger that those who do not feel a \nparticular cultural affinity with their fellow citizens come to be treated as suspect, and their legitimate \npresence in the community questioned.  The potential for persecution and exclusion seems clear \n(Parekh, 1995).  Even in the ideal case where perceptions of cultural commonality accord perfectly \nwith the extension of citizenship, cultural differences with those outside the community or those \ntemporarily resident may come to be exaggerated in the attempt to make citizens aware of their \ndistinctive \u2018identity\u2019.  The result may be a potentially dangerous hardening of physical boundaries and, \nas these acquire a sense of permanence and naturalness, of moral boundaries also.   \n Moreover, such a perspective can have negative implications for political contestation.  \nIdentity of culture risks being taken to entail identity of political ends, with the assumption that where \nthere is cultural consensus there will be widespread agreement on the substantive policies the political \ncommunity should adopt.  One sees this tendency when for instance it is suggested that the divergence \nof opinion amongst Europeans on how best to respond to global crises, and the failure to agree a \ncommon foreign policy, result from the absence of a cultural bond between the populations of Europe \n(cf. Smith 1992, p.56\/71, on the 1990s Balkans crisis).  Political adversarialism, rather than the mark \nof the healthy democracy, becomes that which should fade away once cultural disharmony is removed, \n 7 \nand the conception of citizenship is a demanding but quite passive one, whereby good citizens display \nthe regularity of opinion to which their cultural regularities should dispose them.   \n A standard counter-argument holds that the presence of a cultural bond is actually what allows \npolitical contestation to be pursued to the full, since underlying commonality ensures conflict never \nquite reaches the point of being destructive.  Plausible as this may seem in theory, one wonders \nwhether such contestation is not likely to rely for its animation exactly on those other forms of \ncollective identification (e.g. based on categories of class, or ethnic categories other than those that \nsupposedly define the political community) which are always prone to be suppressed when the talk is \nof cultural ties.  Adversarial debate depends on citizens seeing other groups as people quite different to \nthem: this is, speaking in stereotypes, how the poor may see the rich, or the country-folk may see the \ntown-folk, and arguably it is exactly the sense of otherness which inspires people to mobilise in order \nto capture the political agenda.    \n Recognising the problems that result from a monolithic conception of identity, advocates of a \ncultural bond often emphasise the possibility of multiple identifications and the importance of situation \n(Miller 2000).  There is much talk in the literature of \u2018multi-level\u2019, \u2018nested\u2019 and \u2018cross-cutting\u2019 \nidentities, and even a \u2018marble cake\u2019 model has been proposed (Risse 2003).  While these moves may \nseem to relieve the culturalist perspective of its determinism, the result is a perspective so flexible, \nagential, and instrumental that one wonders what is meant then by \u2018identity\u2019 (normally understood as \ncoherence and sameness) and in what sense shared beliefs and memories are shared (Brubaker & \nCooper 2000).  Are they shared always, or only when agents choose to share them?  If the emphasis is \non choice, must it be these things that they choose to share?  The more cultural identification is \npluralised and relativised, the less it can be seen as determining the viability of democratic institutions.  \nFurthermore, the emphasis on perceptions and beliefs, born of the need to avoid reifying particular \nmarkers, raises epistemological difficulties concerning how to identify these cognitive phenomena.  \nThe danger is then that, faced with uncertainty about the beliefs that bind, one lapses back into \nessentialism and the predetermination of ends by listing certain cultural features as constitutive of the \ncommunity (Smith 1992, p.70), thus pre-empting debate over the nature of the common. \n \n The ideal of a cultural bond is the clearest example of a maximalist conception of the common, \njust as the ideal of a commercial or security bond offers the prime case of a minimalist conception.  \nBoth ideals treat the viability of the polity as determined by a pre-political \u2018substrate\u2019 (Wagner & \nFriese 2002), with the emphasis resting on what citizens may be thought to have in common rather \nthan on that which they might commit themselves to placing in common.  A third set of perspectives \ndeparts from these by imagining bonds of shared values and principles, where these are adopted on the \n 8 \nbasis of reasoned deliberation.  This opens the space for a more dynamic and reflexive conception of \nthe common, yet the tendency towards a too weakly or too strongly binding set of commitments \npersists.  Such perspectives may be said to oscillate between minimalist and maximalist conceptions of \nthe common.   \n In the one perspective, which gravitates to the first of these two poles, such values and \nprinciples are understood as universal in scope \u2013 despite their adoption for a particular polity \u2013 \nbecause they derive from a morality justifiable to all.  Historically, the French Declaration on the \nRights of Man and the US Constitution can be understood as attempts to define principles of universal \nappeal sufficient to bind citizens together in an attitude of patriotism towards their political \ninstitutions; attempts to constitutionalise human rights and the rule of law might be candidate \nexamples in the context of contemporary Europe.  Such a collective bond may be considered \nminimalist in at least two ways.  First, given the conditions of heterogeneity they are intended to \novercome, the temptation is to frame these would-be universal values and principles very abstractly \nindeed, perhaps as little more than a commitment to proceduralism, to ensure their universal appeal.  \nThe concern then is that they become of marginal significance in day-to-day affairs, lacking \nimmediacy to citizens and offering little spur to political involvement.  Because intended to be \ncompatible with a wide array of political programmes, such values can offer little guidance to specific \nforms of action, and are therefore likely to be a weak resource with which to mobilise citizens to \ncollective ends.  Only in the severest crises, when those values are fundamentally at risk, might \ncitizens be reminded of their common bond.   \n Second, as sympathetic critics have noted, even if one accepts such values and principles could \nbe formulated sufficiently abstractly such that reasonable objection would be unthinkable, yet not so \nabstractly as to deprive them of meaning and affective appeal, the political implications might not \nnecessarily be attractive.  Taking the argument on its own terms, there is the risk that an appetite \namongst citizens for the universal could result in a cosmopolitan distaste for all political institutions \u2013 \nexcept perhaps the global \u2013 rather than a strong commitment to one set (Ypi 2008).  Ethical \nuniversalism seems an insufficient source of motivation for political engagement in a bounded polity, \nsince it seems to preclude a claim to the importance of any one specific site of political action (Markell \n2000; Choudhry 2001).  Judged as to how far they embody the universal, the political institutions and \npractices of a neighbouring polity might be deemed more adequate and therefore more enticing as a \nfocus of engagement, as might the activities of deterritorialised actors such as human rights NGOs.  \nConversely, the need to address the ethical failings of the polity in which citizenship is held by \ncontesting its political agenda would presumably be held no stronger than to address the like failings \nof all the world\u2019s polities.  Insofar then as universal values and principles were successful in inspiring \n 9 \nallegiance, a weakening of engagement with the political life of the particular polity, either by \nemigration or a refocusing of attentions, would seem the attendant danger. \n This is what leads some to conclude that a bond of shared values and principles would need to \nbe conceived in more particularist terms.  While arguably one can read the early Habermas as \nadvocating the strong-universalist perspective just described (Markell 2000), it is clear that in his more \nrecent work the principles binding the community are understood to be mediated by particularist \ninterpretation (Habermas 1992; Habermas 2001).  Such a move will be especially welcome to anyone \nwho doubts whether even the most abstractly framed values are really as universal as claimed.  In this \nalternative perspective, moral reflection on the experiences of European history may play a special \nrole, as a shared set of post-nationalist values emerges through engagement with the past and \nacknowledgement of the destructive tendencies of the Westphalian nation-state system.  Lest reflection \nseem too abstract a process, often there is the suggestion that shared values be given tangible form \nwith the creation of a European constitution.  Both the legal text itself, but also the experience of \ndrafting, debating and reinterpreting that text in the public sphere, serve to amplify the values held in \ncommon, ideally exerting a \u2018catalytic effect\u2019 on the consolidation of the polity.   \n By focusing on the discursive renegotiation of the common, this approach avoids the \ntemptation to settle the debate prematurely in favour of a certain understanding of the universal and \npoints to ongoing public debate.  Yet in certain important ways it results in a maximalist conception of \nthe common once more unconducive to contestatory politics and active citizenship.  While it is \nthrough a process of open debate that these values emerge, the parameters within which they should lie \nare strictly defined in advance: deliberation in the unfolding public sphere is marked by its rationality \nand should lead ultimately to a rational consensus.  The model is therefore vulnerable to one of the \ncriticisms made of deliberative democracy more generally: that it is depoliticising because it has an \nelitist bias, since it limits the involvement of citizens who are only weakly able to frame their \ninterventions according to prevailing conceptions of what characterises rational debate (Sanders 1997).  \nA disjuncture may then emerge such that certain values achieve consensus at the elite level \u2013 aversion \nto the death penalty, for instance \u2013 without these reflecting the achievement of a broader consensus \nacross the citizen body, leaving many citizens (perhaps the majority) only with the options either to \nadapt or withdraw their consent.  Insofar as these values are enshrined in a constitution and protected \nby judicial means, their interpretation becomes a matter for judges rather than the democratic process, \npotentially deepening the disjuncture.  Even were one to accept the conceptual possibility of a genuine \nconsensus that extended to all Europeans without being a \u2018top-down imposition\u2019, one would be \nstrained to imagine the public sphere adequately free of power-political influences and the functional \n 10 \nproblems of language diversity such that this ideal consensus could take shape in an inclusive public \ndebate (Grimm 1995). \n Moreover, while it is an open question whether shared values sufficiently uncontroversial to be \nwidely accepted would generate an affective response amongst citizens (certainly several advocates of \nsuch a bond at the European level seem unwilling to abandon a more mythical understanding of the \ncollective at the national level (Weiler 1999)), those that might achieve such a response could well be \npolitically unattractive.  Appealing to emotions of shame and anger, one proposal for a more affective \nconstitutional patriotism (Cronin 2003, p.14), would involve couching much of contemporary politics \nin the language of morality.  This holds problems: if political actors conclude that moralistic \narguments appealing to values embodied in a constitution are \u2018trumps\u2019, it encourages them to frame \npolitical debates as clashes between right and wrong.  This invites the adoption of an unquestioning \ndisposition and a conviction of moral superiority, whereby opposing views are portrayed as \u2018mad\u2019 or \n\u2018bad\u2019, in turn leading to a hardening of intolerance and the demonisation of opponents.  Such features \nhave been noted in the Europe-wide reaction in 2000 to the involvement of J\u00f6rg Haider\u2019s FP\u00d6 party in \nAustria\u2019s coalition government (M\u00fcller 2007; Mouffe 2005).  The withdrawal of normal courtesies at \nthe diplomatic level, and a series of demonstrations by ordinary citizens around Europe intended to \n\u2018shame\u2019 those who voted for Haider, engendered an unattractive mix of expressions of moral \nsuperiority on the one side and defensiveness and indignation on the other, both with nationalist \nundertones.  The boundaries of legitimate public debate became narrowed as those in sympathy with \nhis views were positioned as outside the normal political process.  Much as one may sympathise with \nthe moral judgement behind it, such a move arguably weakens the political process by increasing the \ndanger of anti-democratic responses.     \n \n The conclusion one may take from examining proposals to conceive the European common in \nterms of shared values and principles complements those arrived at previously.  No conceptualisation \nof the collective bond is of such descriptive plausibility that it must be accepted at face value: the \npolitical implications of each are an appropriate element in their assessment.  By demanding a high \ndegree of regularity and consensus across the citizen body, rather like a cultural bond, a thick values \nbond is likely to downgrade the importance of political adversarialism in the life of the political \ncommunity.  Alternatively a formulation in minimalist terms, where that which is shared is universal, \nis depoliticising in a different way, since it may weaken attachments to the polity and since \u2013 like a \nsecurity or a commercial bond, though by dissimilar reasoning \u2013 it may empty public life of the pursuit \nof all but the most general shared ends. \n \n 11 \n \nA Political Bond \n \nThe question then is how a more political bond might be conceived, one which avoids the difficulties \nassociated with the perspectives on the common just examined.  A conception of politics which allows \nfor reasonable but fundamental disagreement requires a collective bond inviting some notion of \ncommon endeavour whilst being clear on the possibility of a plurality of political goods and some \ndegree of conflict in their pursuit.  Some sense of common purpose with other citizens is indispensible, \nbut one need not assume this should be extended to all citizens at all times.  Perhaps there is \ninspiration to be drawn here from agonistic models of democracy, where the potential for persistent \ndisagreement and political struggle tends to be foregrounded (Mouffe 1993).  In this perspective, it is \nprecisely because there may be disagreement on how to interpret the most basic values of democracy \nitself, liberty and equality, that people may be inspired to participate in the political process so as to \nsecure certain objectives and visions.  Those defeated in the political contest at a given moment may \nbe motivated to continue their engagement without conceding the superiority (rational or moral) of the \nposition to which they have lost out.  To be sure, it may be that the possibility of consensus, based not \nso much on the supposed demands of rationality but on a respectful disposition to \u2018hear the other side\u2019 \nand reach compromise where it can be reached, is something to hold on to for the sake of progressive \npolitics and the avoidance of a tyranny of the majority (Wagner & Karagiannis 2005).  But a \nconceptualisation of the collective bond should treat consensus as a possible achievement rather than a \npresupposition.   \n A second and related challenge for formulating a more political conception of the common is \nto maintain a close link to the substantive problems which political decision-making addresses, \nenabling ordinary citizens to \u2018make sense of\u2019 the political community in terms closely related to their \neveryday concerns.  One wants issues of direct significance to act as shared reference-points for the \ncitizens of the polity, at once attracting their sustained attention and acting as a focal-point for \nadversarial exchanges.  While it may be possible to recast constitutional patriotism in more conflictual \nterms so as to accommodate deeper political disagreement (cf. the \u2018constitutional culture\u2019 described in \n(M\u00fcller 2007, pp.54ff)), ultimately any conceptualisation of the common centred on constitutional \nvalues may lack the immediacy required to give citizens a sense of the daily significance of the \npolitical community and of the potential importance of developing relationships of solidarity with \ngroups outside the local environment.  To focus on substantive problems is not of course to remove \nvalues from the equation: they remain embedded in the way problems are articulated and remedies \n 12 \nadvocated, and they will often be appealed to explicitly.  But when describing the nature of \ncommitment to the life in common, there may be advantages to a vocabulary which is more prosaic. \n Some authors, atuned to the possibilities for a problem-oriented approach, have spoken of the \nEU as a \u2018community of shared projects\u2019 in which citizens are bound to one another by their shared or \noverlapping political objectives (Nicola\u00efdis 2001, 2004; Nicola\u00efdis & Lacroix, 2003).  The suggestion \nis that goals such as protection of the environment, the eradication of world poverty and the pursuit of \nmarket integration can act as a basis for collective endeavour (Nicola\u00efdis 2001, p.473).  This intuition \nseems correct, though a number of points should be remembered.  First, there may be very few (if any) \ntasks to which all in the political community are willing to subscribe, and even where consensus seems \napparent this may mask the need to confront those within the community who obstruct their fulfilment.  \nOne needs to be particularly sensitive therefore to how the concern with a given set of substantive \nproblems may be shared by some but not all, perhaps due to divergent interpretations of basic ideas of \nfreedom, justice and equality, and to how one might conceptualise the fact that the pursuit of their \nremedy may proceed in adversarial opposition to others within the political community.  Second, and \nrelatedly, these political objectives need to be open to ongoing reassessment: just as one should not \nsuppose, for instance, that \u2018security interests\u2019 are sufficiently unambiguous to be made the basis for a \ncollective bond, so one should avoid the suggestion that the pursuit of military security could be \nsingled out as the predominant justification for a European polity (Morgan 2005).  Such goals need to \nbe open to dissent and reappraisal. \n \n  Drawing on these cues allows us to imagine, in several stages, how a political bond might look.  \nAt its core would be the myriad substantive problems which provoke a sense of injustice and the \nperceived need for remedy amongst sections of the citizen body.  This political common, as one might \nterm it, could be defined (postponing for a moment its specifically European elements) as the assumed \nexistence by members of the collective of important common problems in need of address.  One thinks \nhere of all the sorts of problem which ordinary citizens may be inclined to articulate as matters of \nconcern \u2013 economic problems, problems to do with anti-social and criminal behaviour, problems to do \nwith inter-cultural relations, environmental problems, and so on.  In contrast to interest-based \napproaches, one need not take a position on the ontological status of these (whether or not such \nproblems are \u2018real\u2019), for it is their appraisal and interpretation which is important.  They would be \n\u2018common\u2019 insofar as they are treated by those who articulate them as shared with others, as liable to \naffect \u2018people like us\u2019 rather than just \u2018me\u2019, where the \u2018we\u2019 may differ according to the problem in \nquestion.  They would not be common in the sense of there being a consensus that every such problem \naffects everyone alike in the political community: on the contrary, a we-they dynamic would be \n 13 \ninvolved, such that it is assumed that there are opponents to \u2018people like us\u2019 living within the political \ncommunity whose position on these problems is quite different, or who may indeed be generative of \nthem.  Rather than binding all citizens to one another in an image of unity, the problems of the \npolitical common would pit some against others in a web of allegiances and conflicts. \n One can suppose that a rich political common composed of diverse kinds of problem would be \nconducive to preserving the integrity of the community.  If opponents are constructed in relation to \nproblems, and there is a plurality of problem \u2018domains\u2019, then there will be a plurality of we-they \nformulations rather than a single axis of confrontation.   Different kinds of problem will provoke \ndifferent ways of formulating opponents, and any one formulation will relate only to a subset of the \nproblems of the common, thus constraining the likelihood that the community fragments into discrete \nadversarial groups who choose to separate from each other.  Those positioned as opponents on \neconomic problems, for instance, might nonetheless be \u2018people like us\u2019 as regards matters of law and \norder, or those positioned as opponents concerning certain cultural practices (e.g. the deployment of \nreligious symbols) might be treated as sharing nevertheless the same economic and environmental \nproblems as \u2018us\u2019.  The feasibility of pointing to a particular section of the citizen body and saying \u2018we \nhave nothing in common with them\u2019 would be reduced by the multiplicity of resources for collective \npositioning.  Thus in substitution for the idea of an all-embracing \u2018we\u2019 such as \u2018the nation\u2019 or \u2018the \ncommunity\u2019, one would envisage numerous lines of intersection between multiple, interdependent \nconstituencies (Connolly 1995, pp.xix-xx).  It would be one of the roles of organised political actors to \ngive shape to these constituencies and articulate new ones by problematising new aspects of the social \nworld and thereby expanding the political common. \n In order to foster a collective bond appropriate to a polity like the EU, the acts of collective \npositioning thus inspired would probably need to fulfil two conditions.  Firstly, as the basis for a \ntransnational demos, one would want those \u2018people like us\u2019 who are affected by the problems in \nquestion \u2013 call them the political subjects \u2013 to be conceived not just as limited to people in \u2018our \ncountry\u2019.  Treating the problems as purely domestic to individual member-states would provide little \nbasis for a wider collective bond, and while it might be valid for a subset of problems to be treated this \nway, this could not be the case for all.  Instead one would want to see the assumption that there are \ncounterparts to \u2018us\u2019 in other EU countries, i.e. people confronted with the same problems.  Their \ndesignation would depend on the problems in question \u2013 class-based categories might be invoked with \nregard to economic problems, other social categories for other domains.  The emphasis would not be \non problems affecting \u2018Europeans\u2019 as such, in broad undifferentiated terms, since this would imply a \nstrong level of consensus and would downplay the agonistic dimension, but there would need to be \nsome sense that there are groups in other member-states who constitute \u2018people like us\u2019.  The bond \n 14 \nbetween subjects and counterparts would be based on the sense of shared predicament, the recognition \nthat their situation is alike.  It would \u2013 at least initially \u2013 amount to something less than active \nsolidarity across borders, although it contributes a perspective on how such solidarity might emerge \n(Offe 2003).  Yet likewise it would entail rather more than a general sense of common humanity: to \nthe extent that others share in \u2018our\u2019 problems, \u2018we\u2019 take interest in their experiences because through \nthe practice of comparison there may be something to be learned, and because occasionally it may be \ndesirable to seek joint political action in remedy of these problems. \nThis positioning of the subjects and their counterparts would have to be coupled with a basic \nlevel of tolerance towards those assumed to be opponents.  While, if one holds that conflict is \nconstitutive of the political, a \u2018we-they\u2019 dynamic of some kind is always present or liable to emerge, \nstill this would have to be agonistic rather than antagonistic: opponents would have to be treated as \nadversaries to be convinced or defeated, rather than enemies to be destroyed or banished from the \ncommunity (Mouffe 2005, p.20).  They would need to be regarded as legitimate sharers of \u2018our space\u2019, \neven if much disliked.  In the European context, for example, those population groups reliant on EU \nsubsidies to support rural, agrarian economies would have to be acknowledged by their opponents as \nlegitimate partners in dispute, even if their conversion to financially less reliant industrial or service-\nbased economies were sought.  While the subjects\/counterparts and their opponents would have little \nin common other than their conflicts and their membership in the community \u2013 there is no overarching \n\u2018identity\u2019 that links them, nor a common set of values beyond the basic ones of liberty and equality \u2013 \ntheir adversarialism would have to stop short of the break-up of the community.  The struggle would \nhave to be treated as ongoing.  One can imagine that the avoidance of nation-based categories to \ndemarcate opponents would be advantageous, since it would encourage other EU countries to be \ntreated not so much as undifferentiated wholes or unitary actors, each with discrete interests and ways \nof life, but as environments in which events unfold, and where counterparts may therefore be sought.  \nUltimately however the required attitude is not something for which one could give conclusive \ngrounds \u2013 opponents would be accepted not because they bear a particular attribute linking \u2018them\u2019 to \n\u2018us\u2019, but simply because, to speak with Wittgenstein, \u2018this is what we do\u2019 (Wittgenstein 1976, \u00a7217).  \nNurturing this attitude would be a role for civic education.  Again, that acts of collective positioning \nwould be made according to problems, with multiple sets of problems at stake, would perhaps make \neasier the task of fostering tolerance and reciprocal engagement, since the plurality of domains would \nmean that those seen as opponents with regard to one set of problems might be seen as \u2018people like us\u2019 \nin connection to another.   \n A political bond would be completed by the assumption that seeking to address these problems \nthrough common institutions constitutes a worthwhile endeavour.  The sense of shared predicament \n 15 \nbefore common problems would have to be linked in other words to belief in the merit of a collective \npolitical project to address them.  This would involve, first, that they be treated as problems which can \nbe tackled, rather than just \u2018facts of life\u2019, and tackled in organised collective terms rather than just an \nad hoc personal basis.  Were there no sense of their possible remedy, such problems would as likely \ninspire a retreat into the private realm as a concern for collective action, and were they assumed to be \nresolvable on a personal basis by individual adaptation there would be no reason to make political \nclaims which attempted to influence decision-making.  Only if they were seen as requiring collective \naddress would these problems have an integrative force.  Second, to constitute a collective bond \nsupportive of a European polity there would have to be the assumption that the nation-state cannot \nalone provide the means to address all these problems adequately, but that some (though by no means \nall) require Europe-wide approaches to be successfully tackled.  Such a perception would probably be \nrooted in taken-for-granted understandings of the nature of such problems, including assumptions \nabout their transnational origins and effects, combined perhaps with the sense that they are not so \nglobal in scope as to resist address at a European level.  Europe-wide measures would have to \u2018make \nsense\u2019 in principle, even if the Brussels institutions in their current form, and the policy-making they \nhave given rise to, were assumed to be deficient in some way.  In this way European-level political \ninstitutions would become natural reference-points in the agonistic encounter between subjects and \nadversaries, with each \u2018we\u2019 seeking to gain influence over these institutions\u2019 agenda so as to advance \ntheir political objectives.   \n Admittedly, this extension of political contestation to the European level would take place \nwithin the context of existing popular attachments to the political institutions of member-states.  Yet \nthere seems no reason in principle why it should entail the abandonment of those attachments.  As \nlong as there remain certain domains of problem for which political action at a continental level is \ndeemed unnecessary, more local approaches would retain appeal.  Furthermore, engagement with \nEuropean institutions might be pursued precisely so as to enhance the ability to influence state-level \ndecision-making, rendering the political struggle complementary across multiple venues.  Of course, \nthe problem of divided allegiances might arise if citizens saw their attachment to national institutions \nand practices not in political but cultural terms: if, for instance, they regarded them not so much as \nfamiliar arenas in which to advance a political project, but as the unique means by which \u2018our\u2019 cultural \ncommunity represents and governs itself.  A strong cultural bond at the member-state (or sub-state) \nlevel would undoubtedly raise challenges for this vision.  But the prospect of persistent nationalism is \nchallenging for any conceptualisation of the European common, because it is a challenge to the very \nidea of a European polity.  To the extent that its persistence is a realistic prospect (and widespread talk \nof a \u2018crisis of national identity\u2019 does question this), the way to moderate it is not by an appeal to \n 16 \nmaterial interests, wider cultural attributes, or shared values and principles, but through the elaboration \nof a political language for transnational collective positioning of the kind described. \n \n A political bond provides a perspective on the common distinctive from those considered in the \npreceding section.  It conceives members of the collective as tied to one another by the reciprocal \nconcern that a sense of shared predicament may generate.  Such citizens, rather than atomised, have a \nweb of links extending outward towards others.  Yet towards those with whom \u2018we\u2019 do not share \nproblems there is no particular bond other than a common focus of attention (on those things widely \nheld to be problematic) and mutual acceptance as members of the same political community.  There is \nno generalised \u2018sense of belonging together\u2019 (Mason 2000), and no presumption of consensus \ntherefore: indeed, the absence of consensus and the consequent desire to control aspects of the political \nagenda are what provide the impetus to come together.  Nor does this conceptualisation presume \ncoherence across issue-areas: indeed, a certain irregularity may usefully soften the symbolic \nboundaries which are constructed towards the world outside the polity.  By conceptualising the \ncommon in this way, one seems to arrive at attractive implications for the nature of citizenship.  A \npolitical bond calls for politicising citizens such that they are inclined to see a substantial body of \nmatters of common concern, widening the context within which they set these problems such that \ntransnational allegiances may develop, and building up their faith in the worth of a collective political \nproject to address them.  It does not assume a high degree of political participation \u2013 there is no \npresumed consensus on the value of active citizenship \u2013 yet it may foster the conditions in which \nparticipation is deemed attractive. \n \n \nTowards a Political Bond \n \nIt would be unrealistic to imagine that such a bond already exists amongst European citizens: the idea \nhas a critical edge intended to suggest how citizenship might develop.  It may be, to a degree, that \nsome of the basic conditions for a political bond are discernible in contemporary practices.  A \nreadiness to identify problems of common concern, and to set some of these in a transnational context, \nis evident when one looks at everyday patterns of discourse on matters of political relevance (Author, \nforthcoming).  Whether or not one wants to speak of an emerging European public sphere, trends in \nthe national news media seem to point towards further coverage of, and comparison with, political \nissues in other European countries (Risse 2007).  But a wider scepticism about what can be achieved \nthrough political agency to address matters of common concern may need to be challenged and \n 17 \nundermined if a political rationale for the EU polity is to find acceptance.  To a large extent a political \nbond remains to be constructed: it is more a diagnostic or sensitising idea than an existing empirical \nphenomenon. \n The EU\u2019s institutional regime may have some role to play in facilitating its emergence, albeit a \nrestricted one.  Adopting this political perspective on the common does not predetermine the type of \ninstitutional configuration towards which the EU should tend, but it does perhaps point towards certain \nregime types over others.  If one imagines a plurality of allegiances inpired by different sets of \nproblems, and if one sees it as normatively attractive to seek to widen these allegiances and multiply \nthe problems appraised, then one will want to avoid a constitutional settlement which allocates on a \nfixed basis certain (or all) problem-areas to decision-making and political contestation only at national \nor European level.  If such a separation of powers favoured institutions at a European level, thus \nestablishing a new political centre, this would risk undermining political debate and attachments to \ninstitutions at the state level (or simply a rejection of the European polity); if it favoured institutions at \nthe state level then it would reduce the plausibility of pursuing a political project at the European level.  \nFor the same reason, if one wishes to see emphasised the EU polity\u2019s potential relevance to the \nproblems of ordinary citizens, one will want to be sure that its institutions are receptive to public \npressure, and that the role of actors outside the democratic process is kept to a minimum.   \n Of the various visions to be found in the literature on EU regimes, one is likely for these \nreasons to prefer those which look to a polycentric rather than centred Europe (Fabbrini 2005; Bellamy \n1999, 2001), and which prize political over legal constitutionalism (Bellamy 2007; Nicola\u00efdis 2001).  \nA centred system generally implies a stable division of institutional competences ordered according to \na hierarchical principle, and while some degree of flexibility may be achieved by periodic amendment, \nthis is likely to remain a top-down process.  In a polycentric regime, by contrast, powers are dispersed \nhorizontally across institutional actors such that they exist in relations of balance, with no single one at \neither national or European level holding supreme authority.  Meaningful political contestation may \nthus be widely extended, and the system should be responsive to changing power configurations.  The \nadvantage of a political-constitutionalist regime meanwhile is that it makes the identification of good \nsubstantive outcomes predominantly a matter for democratic processes.  The possibilities for \ncontestation are rather stronger if the functioning political system is itself understood as the \nconstitutional basis of the polity than if certain desired outcomes have been enshrined as rights and \nmade a matter for judicial interpretation.  Furthermore, a sense of shared predicament with other \nEuropeans can then be developed gradually in the unfolding political process rather than proclaimed \n(and perhaps rejected) at a decisive constitutional moment. \n 18 \n One of the most developed visions of a multifocal regime for the EU, and one which makes no \nspecial goal to preserve cultural bonds at the national level (contra e.g. (Weiler 2001; MacCormick \n1999), sees it as an emerging \u2018directly-deliberative polyarchy\u2019.  In this form of government, certain \npowers are granted to sub-units of the polity so as to give greater voice and freedom to local actors, \nwhile enlarging their frame of reference and the knowledge resources of the wider polity by fostering \npractices of comparison between them.  Local initiatives inform, but are also disciplined by, objectives \nset at the European level (Gerstenberg & Sabel 2002; Cohen & Sabel 2003).  An institutional regime \nbased on such principles could well be conducive to a political bond, since transnational comparisons, \nif widely publicised, could provide a point of mediation between the world of daily experience and the \nbroader life of the European polity, encouraging the idea that other EU member-states represent \nenvironments featuring those with whom problems are shared and with whom a common framework \nfor the pursuit of remedies is needed.  It could provide the basis for various forms of collective action, \ncentred on national parliaments, the European institutions, or in the form of extra-parliamentary \nprotests and campaigns, and intended to produce European-level initiatives or simply to widen the \nframe of reference for state-level initiatives.   \n Admittedly, some of these accounts may be too quick to celebrate the governance practices of \ntoday\u2019s EU such as \u2018comitology\u2019 and the OMC (Sabel & Zeitlin 2007).  Such mechanisms are \nproblematic both because they are exceptionally complex, reducing their potential resonance to all but \nthe experts, and because they rely on some rather technocratic ideas (Tsakatika 2007).  When notions \nof \u2018best practice\u2019 are taken to imply that policies may be right or wrong, regardless of the context of \ntheir application, or when the criteria used for comparisons of \u2018performance\u2019 are unproblematised such \nthat they weigh consistently in favour of a narrow range of practices, then the result is a depoliticising \ntendency.  Further, when comparisons are presented such that they set sub-units of the polity (e.g. \nmember-states) in competition with one another, they may be subversive of a sense of the collective.  \nIf a polycentric regime of this kind is to enable the emergence of a political bond, it requires that \npolitical objectives set at the European level be susceptible to political contestation \u2013 with a clear role \nhere for the European Parliament \u2013 and that their further elaboration within member-states be \nsusceptible to contestation at the state or sub-state level.  It requires furthermore that the basic \nprocedures by which policies are judged, though simplified where possible, remain open to revision.  \n Ultimately, however, a political bond will not be achieved solely through institutional design.  \nInstitutions can promote but they cannot themselves establish the sense of the common which may be \nthe condition of their viability.  This is particularly so if one wants to see emphasised the political \nrationale for the polity, which requires challenging popular expectations about the limitations of \npolitical agency, something which institutions themselves are ill-equipped to do.  It is citizens \n 19 \nthemselves who must lead other citizens in furthering a political bond.  This is likely to depend upon \npolitical movements \u2018from below\u2019 being able to engage people with a stronger sense of the comparable \nexperiences of citizens in other EU countries, and with new ideas about what can be achieved through \ncollective action.  It is a question of remaking the common sense, and depends upon political will.   \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThe emergence of a new polity, its ambiguities of form notwithstanding, provides the opportunity to \nreconsider some fundamental conceptual questions of political theory, amongst them the nature of the \ncommon.  The current EU polity bears little resemblance to a nation-state, and the trajectory of its \ndevelopment may lead to a quite novel political arrangement, yet how one responds to these basic \nquestions says much about which contemporary political trends in nation-state politics one approves of \nand wishes to see replicated at a transnational level.  Rather than mainly empirical, how one defines a \nEuropean demos is an ideological matter, bound up in broader questions of the health of contemporary \ndemocracy.  It is in the context of wider developments such as the ongoing marginalisation of the \nprinciple of democratic control that one should reflect on the common in Europe. \n The suggestion has been that the main existing approaches to this question either conceive of a \nquite minimal degree of commonality amongst citizens or they overplay the degree of regularity which \nis necessary, moves both depoliticising in their consequences.  By minimising the sense of common \npurpose amongst citizens one is liable to diminish the expectation and possibility of exercising \ndemocratic control over matters of common concern; conversely, by overstating the degree of \ncommon purpose one may narrow the sphere of reasonable disagreement and circumvent some of the \nvery debates which it is the peculiar virtue of democracy to make possible.  Consequently, one may \nwant to formulate a more explicitly political conception of the common, something the paper has tried \nto do. \n Even allowing for the ideological character of the debate, it may seem counterintuitive to \npropose a political bond in an age many see as characterised by increasing political scepticism and the \nhollowing of democracy as a political form.  A wide range of trends negative to lively and purposeful \npolitics have been observed, including the decline of ideological cleavages, the weakening of parties, \nthe supposed disengagement of non-elites, the trivialisation of the news media, and the withering of \npractices of collective solidarity and organised bargaining (Mair 2006).  From this perspective, \nmeaningful politics at the national level is under assault from all sides, and to propose a politics-based \nbond for a newly emerging polity is to be severely out of tune with the times.  Insofar as minimalist \n 20 \nand maximalist perspectives on the common are depoliticising in their implications, they may seem to \nresonate rather better with the facts on the ground.   \n The danger with such arguments is that one takes them too far.  Repeated emphasis on political \ndisaffection can itself be depoliticising, for if one declares ordinary citizens too politically ignorant or \napathetic to articulate matters of common concern, the retreat of party elites into themselves and the \ntrivialisation of the news media will quickly seem legitimate responses.  In the face of such \ndevelopments, the disengagement of citizens becomes likely.  For now, not least following an 85% \nturnout in the 2007 French presidential election, it seems premature to dismiss the feasibility of \npopular mobilisation for political ends.  Certainly, a political conception of the common gains further \nplausibility if certain empirical factors are confronted: increasing the responsiveness of EU institutions \nto multiple sources of public pressure so that policy ideas can be thoroughly contested, and fostering \nmore widely the conviction that substantive political problems can be addressed at a European level, \nare two developments that would support this perspective.  But it is such changes which become more \nimaginable when one adopts a political conception of the common. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAuthor (forthcoming, 2009), xxxx, British Journal of Political Science. \nBellamy, Richard (1999), Liberalism and Pluralism: Towards a Politics of Compromise.
