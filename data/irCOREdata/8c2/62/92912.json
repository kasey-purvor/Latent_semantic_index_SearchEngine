The relationship between work \nrole expectations and FWC was found to be significantly stronger for men than for women.  \n \nResearch limitations\/implications - The cross-sectional design of the study does not permit \nfirm conclusions regarding causality, and the results may be influenced by common method \nbias.  \n \nPractical implications - In the face of evidence that organizations are causing the very \nphenomenon that hurts them, the responsibility to assist employees with reducing FWC is \nenhanced. Particularly for men, management of organizational expectations to work long \nhours and prioritize work over family is an area in which employers can and should play a key \nrole if gender equity with regard to organizational work-family climate is to be established.  \n \nOriginality\/Value - This study indicates that organizational work demands may have more \ninfluence over the degree to which employees\u2019 family lives interfere with their work than has \npreviously been assumed, especially for men. \n \nArticle type: Research paper \n \nKeywords: \nWork-family conflict \nSex \nWork role expectations \n  3 \nWith the increase in dual-income families and employed single parents, conflict \nbetween work and family has reached a crisis. Most research on work-family conflict has \ninvestigated the extent to which work interferes with family life (Thompson & Beauvais, \n2000). Organizations, however, may be more interested in the extent to which family \ninterferes with work, and how this process occurs. It has become increasingly clear that each \ndirection of conflict (work-to-family and family-to-work) may be predicted by different \nvariables (Fu & Shaffer, 2001) and may also result in dissimilar outcomes (Greenhaus, \nParasuraman, & Collins, 2001). The formulation of workplace policies to address effects of \nfamily-to-work conflict such as absenteeism, intention to turnover, and job satisfaction (see \nEby et al., 2005 for a review) may be more effective if the antecedents of such conflict are \nbetter understood.  \nThis study has two objectives. First, it seeks to explore the possibility that work role \npressures increase employees\u2019 perceptions that family role pressures are interfering with their \nwork \u2013 a perspective that has not yet been researched. Secondly, it aims to identify any sex \ndifferences in the hypothesized relationship between work role pressures and family-to-work \nconflict. As family-to-work conflict can be a major problem for organizations (Daycare Trust, \n2002), it is important to know if organizations are helping to create the problem themselves \u2013 \nif they are contributing directly to the extent to which their employees\u2019 personal lives are \ninterfering with the performance of their jobs. This knowledge may also have implications for \nhow employees experiencing family-to-work conflict are perceived by others in the \norganization. Work-family options offered by organizations to assist those whose personal \nlives are interfering with their work are often construed by management as favours (Lewis, \nKagan, & Heaton, 2000), granted to employees whose lifestyle choices impinge upon their \nproductivity. As such, these options are widely viewed by both employers and employees as a \ncost to the organization (Lewis, 1997), and their use is often associated with job penalties \n  4 \nsuch as lower performance appraisals and career limitations (Raabe, 1996). The knowledge \nthat organizations are contributing directly to the extent to which their employees\u2019 personal \nlives interfere with the performance of their jobs could force a change in attitudes toward \nwork-family options and those who use them; responsibility for causing a problem implies \nresponsibility for solving it, and organizational work-family options may come to be seen as \nentitlements for employees whose family-to-work conflict is at least partially attributable to \ntheir employers.  \nPrevious empirical results suggest that there are a number of differences in the \npredictors of work-family conflict for men and women. For example, a 1998 study by \nKinnunen and Mauno in which men and women were studied separately showed that levels of \njob insecurity and supervisor support were predictive of work-to-family conflict for women, \nbut not for men. In order to investigate sex differences more thoroughly, it has been \nrecommended that men and women be studied separately (Tenbrunsel, Brett, Maoz, Stroh, & \nReilly, 1995), but most research to date neglects to differentiate between the sexes. \nKnowledge of sex differences in antecedents to work-family conflict has obvious implications \nfor efforts to prevent or reduce conflict. If there are different causes of men\u2019s and women\u2019s \nwork-family conflict, then different approaches to resolving that conflict may be necessary in \norder for individual coping techniques or organizational family-friendly policies to be \neffective. \nAntecedents of Family-to-Work Conflict \nWork-family conflict research is predicated upon the notion of spillover, in which \nattitudes, behaviours, or emotions from one domain diffuse to the other (Near, Rice, & Hunt, \n1980), and upon role theory, which suggests that conflict, or psychological tension, occurs \nwhen individuals engage in multiple roles that are incompatible (Katz & Kahn, 1978). Hence, \nfamily-to-work conflict is said to arise when responsibilities associated with the family role \n  5 \nhinder an individual\u2019s performance at work. For example, worrying about a sick child may \ndistract a parent on the job and reduce his or her efficiency (Duxbury, Higgins, & Lee, 1994).  \nA number of demographic and situational characteristics have been investigated over \nthe years as possible determinants of family-to-work conflict. Established antecedents are \ncaregiving responsibilities, whether for dependent children (Burke & Greenglass, 1999) or \nelderly relatives (Gignac, Kelloway, & Gottlieb, 1996); the number of hours devoted to \nhousehold work (Fu & Shaffer, 2001); and family-related stressors such as parental workload \nand the misbehaviour of one\u2019s children (Vinokur, Pierce, & Buck, 1999). Greater \npsychological involvement in the family role has also been found to predict higher levels of \nfamily-to-work conflict (Adams, King, & King, 1996), as have lower levels of spousal \nsupport (Burke & Greenglass, 1999). \nThe work-family literature has traditionally assumed that variables associated with the \nfamily domain (e.g., childcare, household work) predict family-to-work conflict, and that \nwork domain variables (e.g., hours worked weekly, job autonomy) predict work-to-family \nconflict. When both types of conflict are measured, these are the hypotheses that are usually \ntested (e.g., Williams & Alliger, 1994; Frone, Russell, & Cooper, 1992). Much of the existing \nresearch on both work and family domain variables, however, has used composite, non-\ndirectional measures of work-family conflict. These non-directional measures have \nincorporated items measuring both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict in one \nscale. Studies using these measures cannot determine, therefore, whether antecedent variables \nare predicting work-to-family conflict, or family-to-work conflict.  \nAny influence of work domain variables on family-to-work conflict has been assumed \nto occur through the mediating effects of work-to-family conflict. If work-related problems \nbegin to interfere with the completion of personal or family-related obligations, these \n  6 \nunfulfilled home obligations will begin to interfere with day-to-day functioning at work, and \nvice versa (Frone et al., 1992).  \nAn alternative potential relationship is that work role pressures may increase \nemployees\u2019 perception of family role pressures interfering with their performance at work. If \nstressors originating in one domain create or increase the salience of stressors in another \ndomain, a perspective accounted for by spillover theory and role theory, work domain \nvariables may contribute directly to family-to-work conflict. \nThis opposite-domain perspective has been under-researched. A small number of \nstudies have found direct links between elements of the work domain and family-to-work \nconflict, indicating that mediation via work-to-family conflict is not the only way in which \nwork variables contribute to employees\u2019 family-to-work conflict. For example, research by \nFox and Dwyer (1999) has shown that two work domain variables, job involvement and time \nspent on work activities, can moderate the relationship between family domain variables and \nfamily-to-work conflict. This suggests that work domain variables may play a greater role in \ncontributing to family-to-work conflict than has previously been supposed, and invites further \nresearch.  \nWork Domain Variables \nMany features of the work environment have been positively linked to work-to-family \nconflict, or to non-directional measures of work-family conflict. Five of these with the unique \npotential to also predict family-to-work conflict were chosen for investigation in this study. \nThese are hours worked, work role expectations, control over work hours, work stressors, and \nsupervisor support regarding work-family issues. \nHours Worked \nThe number of hours spent weekly in work activities has been shown to have a \npositive relationship with work-to-family conflict (Fu & Shaffer, 2001). It is plain to see that \n  7 \nmore time spent in the work domain inevitably results in less time available at home, \nrendering more difficult the completion of responsibilities associated with the family role. \nHowever, increased time spent at work also has the potential for increased family-to-work \nconflict. The more time an individual spends in the work domain, the more opportunities are \ncreated for family responsibilities to intrude. Family demands can manifest at any time of day \nor night. An employee who works 35 hours a week and therefore spends more time in the \nfamily domain is less likely to have to deal with family obligations during working hours, \nthus experiencing family-to-work conflict, than is an employee working 60-hour weeks. \nWork Role Expectations  \nExpectations held by superiors and co-workers for an employee to prioritize the work \nrole by assuming increased job-related responsibilities and extending performance of the work \nrole beyond normal working hours have also been shown to contribute to work-to-family \nconflict (Major, Klein, & Ehrhart, 2002). The presence of heightened work role expectations \nmay also play a direct role in contributing to family-to-work conflict. Pressure from \ncolleagues and superiors to assign primacy to the work role may render any intrusions from \nthe home domain more salient; the more an employee perceives that his or her manager \nexpects him or her to give precedence to his or her job, the more aware he or she might be of \nand the more significance he or she may ascribe to any family-related conflict with work, \nsuch as preoccupation with the academic performance of a child, or the task of arranging \nemergency eldercare provision for a parent. Furthermore, expectations of an employee to \nextend the hours spent in the work domain provides increased opportunities for family \nresponsibilities to encroach upon working time, as discussed earlier. \nWork Stressors \nWork role stressors such as overload and conflict are known to create strain in the \nwork domain that spills over into the family domain (Fu & Shaffer, 2001). This process \n  8 \nappears to operate straightforwardly in one direction; however, it has been suggested that \nexposure to strain may result in an increased vulnerability to additional stressors (Ursano, \nGrieger, & McCarroll, 1996), and it is therefore possible that increased strain in one domain \n(e.g., work) may increase the salience of interference arising from another domain (e.g., \nfamily-to-work conflict). Research by Hughes, Galinsky and Morris (1992) supports this \nproposition by finding that work pressures and work-related insecurity predicted employees\u2019 \ntendency to attribute to their job any difficulties they were experiencing in fulfilling their \nfamily role.   \nHypothesis 1: Hours worked weekly, work role expectations, and work stressors will \nbe positively and directly related to family-to-work conflict.  \nControl over Work Hours  \nControl over the scheduling of one\u2019s work hours has been linked to lower perceptions \nof non-directional work-family conflict (Thomas and Ganster, 1995). It is safe to assume that \nautonomy over work hours can contribute directly to perceptions of work-to-family conflict; \nan employee who can take two hours off work one afternoon to drive an elderly relative to a \ndental appointment is bound to perceive less conflict from work with his or her family \nresponsibilities than would an employee with a fixed work schedule.  \nHowever, Adams and Jex (2002) found that perceived control over time predicts lower \nlevels of family-to-work conflict. This suggests that autonomy over work hours may also \ndirectly affect an employee\u2019s perceptions of family-to-work conflict, by enabling an \nindividual to schedule his or her tasks in such a way as to accommodate personal or family \nobligations without work-related repercussions. For example, an employee who can choose to \ntake a few hours off work and make them up later in the day or week would not experience \nthe same degree of conflict from family to work as would an employee not similarly \nempowered should they both be called upon to accompany an elderly parent to a medical \n  9 \nappointment during working hours. The first employee could return to work, stay late, and \naccomplish work tasks as usual, while the second might be forced to take holiday or sick \nleave, fall behind on his or her duties, and possibly acquire a reputation for unreliability \namongst his or her coworkers.  \nSupervisor Support \nThe presence of supervisors who are supportive of an employee\u2019s work-family issues \nhas been associated with lower levels of work-to-family conflict (Anderson, Coffey, & \nByerly, 2002). Supervisor support can be both emotional, involving the provision of \nsympathy and reassurance, and instrumental, involving practical assistance such as changing \nwork or leave schedules to accommodate an employee\u2019s family demands. Such support \nundoubtedly has the potential to reduce work-to-family conflict, but may also directly \ninfluence employees' perceptions of family life interfering with work. An employee who \ncannot find emergency childcare would be forced to stay home with that child and miss a day \nof work in the absence of a supportive supervisor permitting him or her to bring the child to \nthe workplace, or to work from home that day. Another potential explanation for the \nrelationship is that offering sympathy or encouragement to employees with family \nresponsibilities may lessen emotional strain and thereby diminish the experience of family-to-\nwork conflict.  \nHypothesis 2: Control over work hours and supervisor support will be negatively and \ndirectly related to family-to-work conflict.  \nSex Interactions \nThe roles of sex and gender in work-family conflict are not well established, despite a \nnumber of studies incorporating sex as either a direct or a moderating influence on the \nexperience of conflict between work and family. The rational model of work-family conflict \npredicts that men should experience more work-to-family conflict than women, because men \n  10 \ntend to spend more time in work activities than women (Jacobs & Gerson, 2000). By the same \ntoken, women are likely to experience more family-to-work conflict than men, because \nwomen take primary responsibility for the family and thus spend more time in family \nactivities (Scott, 2001).  \nEmpirical findings have not been altogether supportive of this model. In the majority \nof studies examining sex, women have been shown to experience higher levels of both work-\nto-family conflict (Gutek, Searle, & Klepa, 1991) and family-to-work conflict (Duxbury, \nHiggins, & Lee, 1994). This may be due to the fact that women have been found to spend \nmore total hours engaged in work and family activities than do men (Duxbury et al., 1994), \ncreating more opportunities for work and family activities to overlap.  \nA handful of studies have shown sex to moderate the links between various work and \nfamily variables and non-directional measures of work-family conflict. Duxbury and Higgins \n(1991) found that work involvement and family conflict were stronger predictors of work-\nfamily conflict for women than for men, and that family involvement and work expectations \nwere stronger predictors of work-family conflict for men than for women. Having \nresponsibility for childcare (Buffardi, Smith, O\u2019Brien, & Erdwins, 1999) and eldercare (Neal, \nIngersoll-Dayton, & Starrels, 1997) were also found to predict work-family conflict more \nstrongly for women than for men. Because these studies used non-directional measures of \nwork-family conflict, however, knowledge of how sex affects specifically family-to-work \nconflict is constrained. \nTraditional gender role expectations and norms regarding employment and help-\nseeking behaviour have resulted in the association of social support with women, and the \nassociation of work role expectations with men. These gender associations, explored in the \nfollowing section, suggest that the predictive power of each antecedent for family-to-work \nconflict may vary between the sexes. \n  11 \nSex x Work Role Expectations \nDue to the normative nature of gender roles, an individual whose behaviour is \ninconsistent with others\u2019 gender role expectations is often subject to negative judgments from \nothers (Mueller & Yoder, 1997). Conflict between work and family is held to be strongest \nwhen there are penalties, such as negative judgments, for non-compliance with role \nexpectations in either domain (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985). Because men are subject to social \nexpectations that they take on a \u201cbreadwinner\u201d role that involves paid employment but little \nparticipation in family life, they have traditionally experienced stronger penalties than women \nfor their efforts to accommodate family responsibilities, and for their failure to comply with \nwork-role demands.  \nMen are often reluctant to use organization-sponsored work-family programs because \nthey are \u201cafraid of retribution from their employers if they deviate from the traditional male \nnorm\u201d (Powell, 1997: 172). Research by Allen and Russell (1999) found that men who took \nparental leave of absence were less likely to be recommended for organizational rewards than \nwere men who did not take leave. Work role expectations may therefore wield greater \ninfluence over family-to-work conflict for men than for women.  \nHypothesis 3: Sex will moderate the relationship between work role expectations and \nfamily-to-work conflict in such a way that the relationship will be stronger for men \nthan for women.  \nSex x Supervisor Support \nThe ability of supervisor support to influence family-to-work conflict may depend on \nthe employee\u2019s ability to both seek out and accept such support. Employees who are \ndisinclined to ask for support from their superiors, or who are not comfortable receiving \nsupport, may experience less subsequent reduction in family-to-work conflict. These \nemployees may be more likely to be men.  \n  12 \nThe traditional male gender role emphasizes independence and invulnerability; help-\nseeking behaviour can sometimes be construed as admitting weakness (Helgeson, 2005). Men \nmay therefore be reluctant to seek support from others (Butler, Giordano, & Neren, 1985). \nSupervisors may also perceive that men have less need for work-family related support than \ndo women. Work-family conflict is commonly perceived as a women\u2019s issue (Powell, 1997), \nand research has found that both men and women tend to assume that men do not want or \nneed social support (Barbee et al., 1993). In a study conducted across five European countries, \nmen had a much lower sense of entitlement than women to make use of organizational \nsupports for balancing work and family responsibilities (Lewis & Smithson, 2001). This \ndiminished sense of entitlement may hinder the effects of supervisor support in reducing \nconflict for men. In contrast, women have been found to enjoy larger support networks and a \ngreater number of individual sources of support than men, and both the quantity and quality of \nsocial support have been found to exert a greater impact on the well-being of women \ncompared to men (Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987). \nHypothesis 4: Sex will moderate the relationship between supervisor support and \nfamily-to-work conflict in such a way that the relationship will be stronger for women \nthan for men.  \nMethod \nSample \nParticipants in this study were employees of a local authority in the south of England. \nSurveys were distributed to 1,000 employees composing a representative sample of job grade \nclassifications in the organization. Six hundred and fifty-four surveys were returned, for a \nresponse rate of 65%. Of these, 244 respondents were parents of children under age 17 (with \nan average of nearly 2 children each). These 244 respondents formed the participant base for \nthis study, as this sub-sample is uniquely affected by the variables under investigation. Thirty-\n  13 \nsix surveys were excluded from the final analyses due to missing responses, yielding an \neffective sample size of 208.  \nThe majority of respondents (56%) were women. Average age was just over 41 years, \nand 85% of respondents were either married or living with a partner. Just over 14% of \nrespondents had caregiving responsibilities for elderly adult dependants in addition to those \nfor their children.  \nMeasures  \nFamily-to-work conflict was measured using four items developed by Burley (1989, \ncited in Gutek et al., 1991) and one item developed by Bohen and Viveros-Long (1981). Items \nassessed the extent to which respondents experienced conflict from the family to the work \ndomain (e.g., \u201cMy personal life takes up time that I\u2019d like to spend at work\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m often tired \nat work because of the things I have to do at home\u201d). Participants were asked to indicate the \nextent to which they agreed or disagreed with such statements on a five-point scale ranging \nfrom \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d = 1 to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d = 5. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .82.  \nSex was assessed by means of a dummy variable, coded 0 for male and 1 for female. \nFamily role expectations were measured using a four-item scale developed by Cooke \nand Rousseau (1984). Items assessed the degree to which respondents agreed that their friends \nand families expected them to prioritize family over work. The same five-point response scale \nas that used for the dependent variable was employed. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .82. \nParental strain was measured using two items developed by Pearlin and Schooler \n(1978). Items assessed the degree to which children\u2019s behaviour was a source of concern to \nrespondents. The same five-point Likert response scale was used. The reliability alpha was \n.67. \nControl over childcare was measured using a six-item scale developed by Thomas and \nGanster (1995), assessing the degree of choice respondents had in relation to the quality, cost \n  14 \nand scheduling of childcare arrangements. Participants were asked to indicate the amount of \nchoice available to them in relation to each item using a five-point scale ranging from \u201chardly \nany\u201d = 1 to \u201ca lot\u201d = 5. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .90. \nWork role expectations were measured using a four-item scale developed by Cooke \nand Rousseau (1984). Items assessed the degree to which respondents agreed that their \ncolleagues and supervisors expected them to prioritize work over family. Respondents \nanswered each item using a five-point response scale ranging from \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d = 1 to \n\u201cstrongly agree\u201d = 5. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .89. \nSupervisor support was measured using a nine-item scale developed by Shinn, Wong, \nSimko, & Ortiz-Torres, (1989). The scale items assess the degree to which respondents\u2019 \nsupervisors had displayed emotional and practical expressions of support. The same five-point \nLikert response scale was used. Reliability alphas were .73 for emotional support and .86 for \ninstrumental support.  \nWork stressors were measured with three items assessing role overload (i.e., having \ntoo much to do in a given amount of time) developed by Beehr, Walsh and Taber (1976) and \nRizzo, House and Lirtzman\u2019s (1970) five-item scale assessing role conflict. The same five-\npoint Likert response scale was used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .67. \nWork-to-family conflict was measured using four items developed by Kopelman , \nGreenhaus, & Connolly (1983), and two items developed by Bohen and Viveros-Long (1981). \nItems assessed the extent to which respondents experienced conflict from the work to the \nfamily domain (e.g., \u201cMy work takes up time that I\u2019d like to spend with family\/friends\u201d; \n\u201cAfter work, I come home too tired to do some of the things I\u2019d like to do\u201d). The same five-\npoint response scale was used. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .85. \nControl over work hours was measured using an eight-item scale developed by \nThomas and Ganster (1995), assessing the degree of choice respondents had in relation to the \n  15 \nscheduling of work activities. Participants were asked to indicate the amount of choice \navailable to them in relation to each item using a five-point scale ranging from \u201chardly any\u201d = \n1 to \u201ca lot\u201d = 5. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was .79. \nAnalysis \nHierarchical regression analysis was used to test the impact of the independent \nvariables (work domain variables, work-to-family conflict, and sex) in predicting the \ndependent variable (family-to-work conflict). To test Hypotheses 1 and 2, home domain \nvariables were entered in step 1 of the equation, followed by work domain variables in step 2. \nEntering the work domain variables in this subsequent step enabled examination of the \nincremental effects of the work domain predictors beyond the effects of the home domain \npredictors on variance in family-to-work conflict. In the third step, work-to-family conflict \nwas entered.  \nTo test Hypotheses 3 and 4, the interaction terms (sex x work role expectations, and \nsex x supervisor support) were entered in the final fourth step, permitting the significance of \nthe interactions to be determined after controlling for the main effects of the independent \nvariables. The predictor variables were centred before forming interaction terms, in order to \nreduce the multicollinearity often associated with regression equations containing interaction \nterms (Aiken and West, 1991). Changes in R2 were used to evaluate the ability of the \ninteraction terms to explain variance beyond that accounted for by the main effects in the \nequation. \nSignificant interactions were probed using procedures recommended by Aiken and \nWest (1991). The regression equation was restructured to represent the regression of family-\nto-work conflict on the independent variables (work role expectations, and supervisor \nsupport) for the two different sexes. Two separate regression equations were calculated, one \n  16 \nfor men and one for women. T-tests were then performed on simple slopes of the equations to \ndetermine if they differed from zero. \nOne of the aims of this study was to investigate whether opposite-domain predictors \nhave a direct effect on family-to-work conflict, or whether the effect is mediated through \nwork-to-family conflict. To test for mediation, the procedure recommended by Baron and \nKenny (1986) was used. In this procedure, three regression models are investigated. First, the \nmediator (work-to-family conflict) is regressed on the independent variables (work domain \nvariables); second, the dependent variable (family-to-work conflict) is regressed on the \nindependent variables (work domain variables); and third, the dependent variable (family-to-\nwork conflict) is regressed simultaneously on the independent (work domain variables) and \nmediator (work-to-family conflict) variables.  \nMediation is present if the following conditions hold true: the independent variable \naffects the mediator in the first equation; the independent variable affects the dependent \nvariable in the second equation; and the mediator affects the dependent variable in the third \nequation. The effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable must be less in the \nthird equation than in the second. Full mediation occurs if the independent variable has no \nsignificant effect when the mediator is in the equation, and partial mediation occurs if the \neffect of the independent variable is smaller but significant when the mediator is in the \nequation. \nResults \nFactor Analysis \nThe factoring method used for all scales was principal axis. Ford, MacCallum, and \nTait (1986) recommend this common factoring method in place of the principal components \nmethod of analysis, which mixes common, specific, and random error variances. Varimax \northogonal rotation was used for all scales in accordance with Hinkin\u2019s (1998) \n  17 \nrecommendation, as the intent was to develop scales that were reasonably independent of one \nanother.  \nTwo items were dropped from the family role expectations scale following principal \naxis analysis, as one loaded highly on more than one factor, and the other loaded onto the \nsame factor as the parental strain items. Two items from the control over work hours scale \nloaded on different factors from the remainder of the items, and were therefore dropped. \nItems from the supervisor support scale dealing predominantly with work-family \nrelated emotional support (e.g., \u201cMy supervisor has shown resentment of my needs as a \nworking parent\u201d) loaded onto a separate factor from items concerning instrumental \ndemonstrations of support (e.g., \u201cMy supervisor has juggled tasks or duties to accommodate \nmy responsibilities at home\u201d). The three attitudinally-based items were therefore combined to \ncreate an \u201cEmotional support\u201d subscale, while the remaining six items formed the \n\u201cInstrumental support\u201d subscale. \nDescriptive Statistics \nINSERT TABLE I HERE \nThe means, standard deviations, correlations, and reliability alphas for each of the \nstudy variables are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 shows that there are sex differences in \nfamily and work domain variables; specifically, men reported working an average of nearly \n41 hours per week, while women worked just over 31 hours (t = 8.56, p < .001), and men \nexperienced significantly higher levels of work role expectations than did women (t = 3.09, p \n< .01).  \nSurprisingly, men also reported significantly higher levels of family role expectations \nthan did the women in this study (t = 2.56, p < .05). One explanation could lie in changing \npatterns and societal expectations of men\u2019s family involvement. While women generally \nremain the primary caregivers for children, men are increasingly taking responsibility for care \n  18 \nand becoming more involved (Levine & Pittinsky, 1997), especially as their wives or partners \nenter the workforce in ever-greater numbers. Being unaccustomed to this increased level of \nparticipation in family roles, perhaps men are apt to perceive family role expectations as more \nsalient than do women, who have borne the responsibility longer.  \nThere were no significant differences between men and women\u2019s average levels of \nfamily-to-work conflict or work-to-family conflict. \nINSERT TABLE II HERE \nMain and Moderating Effects \nThe results of the hierarchical regression analyses are presented in Table 3. \nHypotheses 1 and 2 were not supported, with work domain variables failing to predict family-\nto-work conflict at a significant level once the interaction terms were entered into the \nequation.  \nINSERT TABLE III HERE \nThe interaction between sex and work role expectations was a significant predictor of \nfamily-to-work conflict (\u03b2 = -.18, p < .05), providing support for Hypothesis 3. Simple slopes \nand t-tests for this interaction are featured in Table 4. Contrary to Hypothesis 4, no significant \ninteraction was found between sex and supervisor support in predicting family-to-work \nconflict.  \nINSERT TABLE IV HERE \nAs shown in Table 3, when work domain variables were entered in a subsequent step \nto the family domain variables and work-to-family conflict, the incremental variance \nexplained in family-to-work conflict was significantly increased (\u0001R2  = .07, p < .05). This \nsuggests that work domain variables are capable of predicting family-to-work conflict \ndirectly, rather than only indirectly via work-to-family conflict. Surprisingly, the relationship \nbetween hours worked weekly and family-to-work conflict, and that between instrumental \n  19 \nsupervisor support and family-to-work conflict, were in the opposite directions to those \nexpected.  \nMediating Effects \nThe results of the mediation analyses are presented in Table 3. The first condition of \nBaron and Kenny\u2019s (1986) test for mediation was met; the independent variables (work \ndomain variables) were significantly related to the proposed mediator, work-to-family conflict \n(\u03b2 = .25, p < .001 for hours worked weekly, \u03b2 = .24, p < .001 for work role expectations, \u03b2 = -\n.18, p < .01 for control over work hours, \u03b2 = .13, p < .05, and \u03b2 = .11, p < .001 for work \nstressors. \nThe second condition requires that the independent variables (work domain variables) \nbe significantly related to the dependent variable (family-to-work conflict). As Table 3 shows, \none work domain variable \u2013 instrumental supervisor support \u2013 was significantly related to \nfamily-to-work conflict (\u03b2 = .23, p < .05). \nThe third condition stipulates that the proposed mediator (work-to-family conflict) \nmust be related to the dependent variable (family-to-work conflict), and when work-to-family \nconflict and work domain variables are entered together in the equation, the effect of the work \ndomain variables on family-to-work conflict must be less when work-to-family conflict is in \nthe equation than when it is not. The results indicate that no mediation effects exist in the \nrelationship between work domain variables and family-to-work conflict. \nDiscussion \nThe purpose of this study was twofold. The first objective was to investigate the \neffects of work domain variables on family-to-work conflict. The second goal was to examine \nhitherto unexplored differences between men and women in the predictors of family-to-work \nconflict.  \n  20 \nWork Domain Antecedents of Family-to-Work Conflict \nAs can be seen in Table III, same-domain predictors, i.e., variables originating in the \nfamily domain, explained the preponderance of variance in family-to-work conflict. The \ndegree of parental strain respondents experienced emerged as a significant predictor of \nfamily-to-work conflict. Dependant care responsibilities have long been established as \ncontributors to family-to-work conflict (e.g., Williams & Alliger, 1994), providing as they do \nincreased opportunities for family responsibilities to spill over from home to work. \nAugmenting those responsibilities, through the misbehaviour of children demanding extra \nattention and involvement, serves to intensify the amount to which family is perceived to \ninterfere with work. \nNevertheless, the findings do indicate that opposite-domain predictors play an \nimportant part in contributing to family-to-work conflict. Work domain variables explained \nsignificant additional variance in family-to-work conflict beyond the effects of family domain \nvariables, and were not mediated by work-to-family conflict as is generally assumed in the \nliterature. These results suggest that work demands made by organizations may have more \ninfluence over the degree to which their employees\u2019 personal or family lives interfere with \ntheir work than has previously been assumed. In combination with the fact that work-family \nresearch consistently finds employees reporting more work-to-family conflict than family-to-\nwork conflict (e.g., Burke & Greenglass, 1999; Gutek et al., 1991), the results of the present \nstudy indicate that much of the conflict between work and family experienced by employees - \nand the stress, lost productivity, and other negative repercussions of such conflict - is \nattributable to organizational factors. In particular, expectations for employees to work long \nhours and prioritize the work role over the family role appears to increase the extent to which \nemployees find their family lives interfering with the performance of their jobs. This raises \nimplications for organizations with regard to their responsibility in providing assistance with \n  21 \nwork-family conflict. In the face of evidence that organizations are causing the very \nphenomenon that hurts them, the responsibility to modify their demands on employees and \nreduce levels of conflict is enhanced.  \nOf the work domain variables under investigation, hours worked weekly and \nsupervisor support emerged as the strongest contributors to family-to-work conflict. As \npredicted, sympathy and encouragement offered by supervisors was related to lower levels of \nfamily-to-work conflict, presumably by diminishing emotional strain. The relationship \nbetween instrumental support and family-to-work conflict, however, was in the opposite \ndirection from that predicted. The more instrumental work-family support provided by \nrespondents\u2019 supervisors, the more family-to-work conflict those respondents reported. While \nthis finding seems counter-intuitive, the rationale behind it may be rooted in direction of \ncausality. Employees experiencing high levels of family-to-work conflict may simply elicit \nmore supportive behaviours from their supervisors than do employees without discernible \nconcerns regarding the conflict with work of family or personal responsibilities. \nAn alternative explanation may be that a \u201creverse\u201d buffering effect is taking place. \nSome researchers (e.g., Fenlason & Beehr, 1994) have found instances in which greater levels \nof social support resulted in decreased individual well-being, and suggested that this effect \nmay be due to negative communications received from those offering the social support. For \nexample, if an employee facing family-to-work conflict requires the assistance of a manager \nto change his or her work schedule in order to accommodate family responsibilities, and the \nmanager reiterates how difficult it is to raise a family and pursue a career simultaneously, the \nemployee may exit the situation feeling worse than before having received the instrumental \nsupport. The message conveyed by the supervisor in this instance may reinforce the \nemployee\u2019s psychological tension derived from competing role demands, and result in \nincreased levels of family-to-work conflict. \n  22 \nThe more hours respondents spent in work activities, the less family-to-work conflict \nthey reported. This finding runs counter to the argument that more time in the work domain \nnecessarily results in less time spent in the home domain, thus creating increased \nopportunities for family responsibilities to intrude upon the workplace. A possible explanation \nmay lie in traditional gender role expectations. As can be seen in Table 2, there is a strong \nassociation between hours worked weekly and sex. The men participating in this study \nreported an average working week of nearly ten hours longer than that of the female \nrespondents. If men\u2019s primary domain is traditionally seen to be that of work, and if their \ntraditional role as \u201cbreadwinner\u201d is seen as providing for the upkeep of the family unit, then \nthose working the longest hours may also have partners fulfilling traditional gender roles by \nassuming primary responsibility for the home and ensuring family demands do not intrude \nupon the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d\u2019s work responsibilities. Post hoc analyses revealed a significant \ninverse correlation between respondents\u2019 work hours and their partners\u2019 incomes, suggesting \nthat the partners of long-hours respondents either do not work outside the home, or are \nemployed in low-level or reduced-hours jobs.  \nSex Differences  \nAs displayed in Table IV, the findings of this study indicate that there are sex-based \ndifferences in how some work domain variables relate to family-to-work conflict. Work role \nexpectations interacted with sex to predict levels of family-to-work conflict, such that the \nrelationship between these two variables was stronger for men than for women. This finding \nfalls in line with Greenhaus and Beutell\u2019s (1985) reasoning that conflict between work and \nhome domains is highest when negative sanctions exist for failure to comply with role \nexpectations. Having traditionally experienced stronger sanctions than women for non-\ncompliance with work role demands, the relationship between work role expectations and \nconflict would be expected to be stronger for men. Duxbury and Higgins (1991) obtained a \n  23 \nsimilar result using a non-directional measure of work-family conflict, but it has now become \nevident that work role expectations have a direct influence on family-to-work conflict. \nInterruptions from the home domain may assume more salience for the individual who \nperceives expectations from his co-workers and supervisors to prioritize the work role above \nall others. In this study, men experienced significantly higher levels of work role expectations \nthan did women, which may also have played a part in strengthening the relationship between \nexpectations and conflict; according to Duxbury and Higgins (1991), men may have difficulty \nbalancing work and family demands due to greater organizational expectations that men will \nsubordinate their family needs to the job. \nPractical implications \nThe findings of this study demonstrate that family-to-work conflict increases when \nemployees perceive that their co-workers, superiors, and the organization in general expect \nthem to put in long hours and assign priority to work over home in order to progress in their \ncareers. Particularly for men, management of such expectations is an area in which \norganizations can and should play a key role. Increasing awareness of unreasonable \nexpectations among supervisors, role modelling behaviours such as leaving on time and \nvaluing activities outside of work among upper management, improving access to work-\nfamily programs for male employees, and addressing the potentially negative consequences of \nusing these programs could all contribute to a shift in workplace culture to acknowledge the \nimportance of men\u2019s family roles.  \nIn order to be effective, these types of initiative must be supported and encouraged by \nmanagement. Previous research has shown that managerial sensitivity to work-family issues \nvaries wildly and is often contingent upon the manager\u2019s own personal circumstances. For \ninstance, female managers and those with greater parental responsibilities have been shown to \nbe more flexible in helping employees meet their work-home needs than have male managers \n  24 \nand those with less parental responsibility (Parker & Allen, 2001), and female managers have \nalso been found to grant more subordinate requests for flexible working arrangements than \nhave male managers (Powell & Mainiero, 1999). Assessment of managers\u2019 work-family \nawareness and effectiveness in rendering assistance to affected employees could be \nincorporated into the performance appraisal process, as a means of strengthening management \nincentive to work with employees towards a solution to the problem of work-family conflict. \nIncreased managerial support for work-family issues may then have a \u201ctop-down\u201d effect on \nimproving staff attitudes towards employees taking time off for personal or family reasons. \nThis culture change is overdue and entirely necessary should organizations wish to reduce \nlevels of work-family conflict amongst their employees. \nLimitations  \nThis study bears some limitations. Because the data were collected through the use of \na single survey at a single point in time, the results may be influenced by common method \nbias. Most noticeably, the cross-sectional design of the study does not allow for firm \nconclusions regarding causality. When investigating the effects of variables such as the \npresence and number of adult dependants, determining direction of causality is not \nproblematic, but longitudinal research is necessary to address issues of directionality with \nregard to other variables such as work role expectations.  \nConclusions and Future Research \nThe aims of this study were to investigate the direct effects of work domain variables \non family-to-work conflict, an approach unprecedented in the work-family literature, and to \ndetermine whether these work pressures similarly affect both men\u2019s and women\u2019s experience \nof family-to-work conflict. Testing this opposite-domain perspective reveals that work \ndomain variables do exert a significant effect on family-to-work conflict above and beyond \nthe effects of family domain variables, and independent of work-to-family conflict. This \n  25 \nindicates that organizational work demands and role pressures may have more influence over \nthe degree to which employees\u2019 family lives interfere with their work than has previously \nbeen assumed, especially for men. The relationship between work role expectations and \nfamily-to-work conflict was found to be significantly stronger for men than for women. \nCurrent norms still appear to require men to leave their family obligations at home (Wiley, \n1991) and assign priority to the work domain, rendering more salient any family interruptions \nwith work. \nFurther research investigating men\u2019s changing attitudes toward involvement in family \nlife and orientation toward work roles may help to convince organizational policy makers of \nthe need to adjust current norms to create a more supportive work-family climate for \nemployees of both sexes. In order to ensure that men and women are equally able to balance \nthe competing responsibilities of work and home, greater gender equity with regard to \norganizational work-family climate needs to be established. Understanding the rationale \nbehind prevailing managerial attitudes toward men\u2019s involvement in work and family roles \nmay help in developing strategies to enact such equity.  \n  26 \nReferences \nAdams, G.
