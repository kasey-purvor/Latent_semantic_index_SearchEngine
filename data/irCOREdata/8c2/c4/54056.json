Research designs \nmust therefore address multiple contexts and levels \npresenting an analytical challenge to researchers.  In \nthis project we extend work that investigates the \nsignificance of emergence in theorising entrepre-\nneurship into an exploration of how to articulate the \ncreation and flow of value and effective ontology in \na creative landscape. \nThe Project \nStudying the creative industries in the \nDigital Economy presents challenges \nfrom a research point of view, because of \nthe multifaceted nature of the domain, \nwhich embraces: \n\u2022 A diverse range of increasingly cross-\nlinked industries (e.g. arts, culture, \nheritage, gaming, performance, sports) \n\u2022 The potential for many inter-related \n(aesthetic) artefacts and services \n\u2022 The potential that digital technology \ncan establish new resonances between \nsocial practices and the techno-\ncreative milieu \n\u2022 The need for continually (re) organi-\ning entrepreneurial and innovative \nteam collaborations around new pro-\njects \n\u2022 The emergence of novel, sometimes \nunorthodox, combinations of people \nand technologies for which there may \nbe no precedent \n\u2022 The potential for values issues to \ncause clashes regarding interchange of \nartistic, cultural, social capitals (par-\nticularly where creative output is criti-\ncal or challenging of powerful \ngroupings). \nThese activities take place in a busi-\nness environment that is fast-moving, \nhas high market uncertainty and has in-\ndeterminate outcomes, as new technolo-\ngies continue to evolve and standards \nand legislative practices surrounding \ntheir use are unclear. Better understand-\ning of how new value creating systems \nemerge in such landscapes can give us a \nbetter insight into how such processes \ncan be managed and supported, thereby \ncontributing, in a small way, to the sus-\ntainability of the creative industries \noverall.  Yet the very diversity and fluid-\nity of such ecosystems presents a consid-\nerable challenge to traditional models of \nresearch into business innovation and \nentrepreneurship. Inevitably our research \ndesigns must address multiple contexts, \nlocations (virtual and physical) and lev-\nels of analysis presenting a methodologi-\ncal challenge to management researchers \nas Pettigrew has argued [1].  \nAn obvious approach to dealing with \nthis fluidity is to simplify research de-\nsigns by focusing on one level of analy-\nsis, in most cases the individual, the firm \nor the industry.  Yet this can only lead to \npartial, impoverished pictures of what is \nsurely a far more rich and vibrant milieu. \nThus, we used this study to develop \nworkable methods for capturing the dy-\nnamics of such systems, based on some \nearlier work we had carried out applying \ncomplexity theory to the study of entre-\npreneurial firms. The assumption is that \ntraditional methods such as cross-\nsectional analysis and retrospective nar-\nratives do not capture either the richness, \nor processes of emergence in such a way \nthat enables knowledge transfer to new \nprojects in the same milieu. \nOur approach was to work with actors \nin live projects in order to examine how \nnovelty emerges over time in dynamic, \nfluid domains where uncertainty is high \nand outcomes are indeterminate.  Firstly, \nwe carried out an internet-based case \nstudy of Blast Theory\/Rider Spoke, to \ngenerate understanding of concepts such \nas pervasive computing, ubiquitous \ncomputing, urban sensing, and the eco-\nsystems surrounding them.  Secondly, \nwe carried out interviews and discus-\nsions with staff at IT-Innovation, a com-\npany involved in developing a new \nbusiness model for a portal in the post-\nproduction rendering industries in Soho.  \nThirdly, we carried out participant ob-\nservations of interactions in Proboscis\u2019 \nSensory Threads project and the Gesture \nand Embodied Interaction workshops at \nNewcastle and Cambridge.  We explored \nhow novelty emerged through interac-\ntions between the actors in the projects, \nand how novelty was related to value \ncreation and the possible engagement of \n[new] external stakeholders. \nAgility and Sustainability \nAs entrepreneurship researchers, we \nhave asked questions concerning how \nentrepreneurs maintain agility, the ability \nto see ahead, to strategise in an innova-\ntive manner, to act at the right time to \nrepeatedly achieve and maintain com-\npetitive edge in such uncertain and un-\npredictable environments.  Our previous \nresearch, based on complexity theory \n[2][3] has shown that entrepreneurs who \nare successful over long periods of time \nare continually organising and reorganis-\ning in anticipation of new products, new \nservices, new business models, and new \nvalue creating systems not only reflect-\ning, but shaping new patterns of con-\nsumer behaviour, that may be some way \nahead in the future.  To achieve sustain-\nability over time, they are practising \nanticipatory behaviours that can be \nlearned or developed in others. A key \npart of that behaviour, is that they are \nengaged in a pattern of continuous ex-\nperimentation that repeatedly generates \nnew strategic options, some of which, in \ntime, become \u2018the firm\u2019, when the time \nto act is right.  We have identified four \nkey, highly interrelated processes, which \nresult in the emergence of novelty over \ntime in entrepreneurial firms: \n1. Experiments: small scale models test-\ning for fitness in the landscape \n2. Reflexivity: the continuous reshaping \nof the meaning of what the owner and \nthe business \u2018are\u2019 in relation to others \n3. Organising domains: the breaking and \nreforming of everyday patterns of do-\ning doing business \n4. Sensitivity to conditions: the detection \nand evaluation of environmental \nchange and the motivation to respond. \nThese processes are not planned or \nformalised. Rather, they are a \u2018way of \nbeing\u2019, the essence of agility and fore-\nsight for the entrepreneurs we have \nworked with. We argue that it is the \nmulti-dimensional concentration on \nthese patterns of behaviour that is at the \nheart of entrepreneurial competence \nthrough effective strategising over time \nto produce a sustainable endeavour.  \nOver time, the four EROS processes \ninteract to produce new emergent struc-\ntures; yet not all structures persist to the \npoint where they are fully implemented \nor developed.  Instead temporary struc-\ntures that might, persist reflecting Saw-\nyer\u2019s \u2018Emergence Paradigm\u2019 of social \nstructures that [4] that posits a hierarchi-\ncal model of individual, interaction, \nephemeral emergents, stable emergents, \nand social structures. \nWe have identified such temporary \nstructures in our early empirical work in \nthis domain.  They seem to include par-\nticular business models, particular identi-\nties, particular dominant logics, particu-\nlar triggers for change etc. Within that \nmilieu, some are more stable than others \nand became part of the business; others \ninitially commanded intensive resource \nand attention, but were not developed \nthrough to fruition.  Nonetheless, even \nephemeral and unstable structures that \ndid not persist, exhibited ontological \nstatus and considerable causal power \u2013 at \nleast for a time, as the firm explored \nwhether value could be extracted from \nthese resonant structures in the face of \nhighly uncertain environments.  The \ncontinual construction of such temporary \nstructures thus represents a form of \u2018an-\nticipatory strategising\u2019 on the part of \ncreative individuals, who, in their identi-\nfication and exploitation of new and \nexpanding niches, seek not to merely \nreact to, but also to shape new forms of \nconsumer and\/or participant behaviour as \nindustries change. \nFrom this conceptual base we have de-\nrived a framework [5] (too big to repro-\nduce here), which, we posit, captures \nhow novelty arises as emergent order \nover time; through the development of \nephemeral, and then stable emergents.  \nThis framework makes a significant con-\ntribution to methodological approaches \nto understanding the dynamics of inno-\nvation by opening up possibilities de-\nrived from rigorous theoretical \nconceptualisations of emergence.  \nAn empirical testbed? \nWe used this project as an empirical \ntestbed for our framework.  We asked \nthe following questions: \n\u2022 Does the framework coherently and \ncomprehensively theorise the linkage \nbetween entrepreneurial processes and \nemergent ontologies produced in the \ncreative industries\/digital economy \ncontext? \n\u2022 Does it support effectively the collec-\ntion of data and the ordering and cate-\ngorising of empirical observations \nconcerning how different phenomena, \nsuch as new products, services, firms, \nnetworks, patterns of behaviour, ca-\nreers, identities, emerge over time \nacross multiple levels of analysis? \n\u2022 How are these observations best \nlinked to improving practitioner com-\npetence and sustainability of the firms \noverall? \nOur assumption was that the projects \nin this study were analogous in certain \nkey ways to the entrepreneurial firms we \nhad studied in the past, in that the emer-\ngence of novelty was not limited to local \nchange or value, but had the potential to \ngrow, to produce or capitalise on new \nmarkets, or maybe even to shape new \npatterns of consumer behaviour.  Of \ncourse, we are all familiar with acts of \nindividual creativity that result in artistic, \nsocial or cultural capital that may not in \nthemselves realise economic value, or be \nwidely available, reproducible or dis-\nseminated as products or services outside \nthe initial act of creation: a unique art-\nwork or a performance for example.   \nYet new digital technologies have \nthrown up innovative new possibilities \nthat can challenge, disrupt and may even \noverthrow existing revenue streams and \nindustry patterns.  It is this indetermi-\nnacy of outcome, the dynamic and un-\npredictable, the unknown shape or \ncharacter of scalability in new industries, \nand how it will be achieved, that reso-\nnates with the tenets and underpinning \nassumptions of complexity theory.  And \nit is here that we believe our framework \nhas the methodological potential to cap-\nture and make sense of multiple observa-\ntions across different levels of analysis \nand show linkages between levels as new \nphenomena (products, services, business \nmodels) emerge over time.  We argue \nthat in identifying and linking the unsta-\nble and ephemeral emergents that inevi-\ntably arise during creative collaborations \n\u2013 the twists and turns, unformed explora-\ntions, failed experiments, discarded and \nretained ideas \u2013 to entrepreneurial, proc-\nesses that preserve artistic and creative \nvalue, we can gain much improved in-\nsight into how creative individuals oper-\nate and achieve sustainability in \nconditions of high uncertainty. \nOutcomes \nClearly, being involved with projects as \nrich as those presented by Sensory \nThreads, Gesture and Embodied Interac-\ntion, and IT-Innovation has afforded us a \nrich stream of data and connections that \nwill take many months to analyse. In this \nlimited space, it is only possible to iden-\ntify some preliminary outcomes that are \nnonetheless highly promising.  Using our \nconceptualisation and our framework, \nwe were able to identify and track the \nemergence of \u2018stable emergents\u2019: \n \n\u2022 Sensory Threads: the \u2018Rumbler\u2019 a \nnovel interactive soundscape device \n\u2022 Gesture: a unique combination of \nskill-sets in the sound\/motion capture \ndomain, supported by robust code \n\u2022 IT-Innovation: a potential business \nmodel as yet untested \nThese \u2018stable emergents\u2019 arose during \nthe period of the projects from very early \nstage ideas that were not well articulated \nat the outset of Creator. As discussions \nin the rich interdisciplinary milieu pro-\ngressed, possible trajectories were identi-\nfied and tested out, either as thought \nexperiments, shared metal models, or \nsometimes as rough working prototypes.  \nAt some point, these \u2018ephemeral emer-\ngents\u2019 were narrowed down to the most \npromising variant: at this point the tran-\nsition from ephemeral to stable occurs.  \nWe would moot that this is the point at \nwhich discussions shift from value crea-\ntion to value capture.  This is a signifi-\ncant outcome that with in-depth \ndiscussion can be developed into a sig-\nnificant contribution to the entrepreneur-\nship and innovation literatures. \nFinal thoughts \nThe project has in the short term enabled \nus to test a framework that enables and \nsupports experimental design, data col-\nlection, data analysis and reflective \nevaluation of the emergence of novelty, \nwith very promising results. \nMore significantly, it has enabled the \ndevelopment of a methodological agenda \nfor capturing social value and social \nresonances for future projects in the \ncreative industries\/digital economy mi-\nlieu.  By developing insight in this area, \nwe hope to better articulate how leading \nedge creative firms and groupings con-\ntribute to the creative industries ecosys-\ntem overall \u2013 and correspondingly, we \nhope, improve their sustainability. \nAcknowledgement \nThis project is part of the EPSRC cluster project, \nhttp:\/\/www.creatorproject.org\/, (EP\/G002088\/1) \nReferences and Notes \n1.
