All errors are of course my own. \n 3 \nIntroduction \nThis paper explores whether and how the notion of \u201eassemblage\u201f might begin to offer a \ndistinct conceptualisation of spatiality in social movements.  It seeks to offer an \nalternative to the dominance of \u201enetwork\u201f for conceptualising the spatiality of social \nmovements. While I find network a useful notion and have used it in the past \n(McFarlane, 2006), in this paper I consider how the notion of assemblage might present a \ndifferent conceptualisation of space in social movements than network. This in turn \nhighlights some issues and questions that the language of network does not quite manage \nto address. This is not to suggest that network is not a useful notion, or indeed to suggest \nthat assemblage is without problems, but to examine the relations between social \nmovements, space and assemblage as a theoretical problem that may be productive of \ndifferent lines of inquiry. My impetus for doing so is my own sense of dissatisfaction \nwith the language of network \u2013 or, indeed, scale \u2013 for conceptualising the spatialities of \nurban social movements that I have been researching in Mumbai, India, and which I will \ndraw upon in the main body of the paper. \n \nIn recent years, there has been an increasing use of the term \u201eassemblage\u201f in geographical \nscholarship. The sources and uses of assemblage have varied considerably. In large part, \nits use reflects the more general redefinition of \u201ethe social\u201f as materially heterogeneous, \npractice-based, emergent and processual. If the obvious reference points here for \ngeographers include actor-network theory (Latour, 2004; 2005; Law and Hassard, 1999) \nand nonrepresentational theory (e.g. Thrift, 2007), there has been a wide variety of uses \nof the term assemblage in geography that seeks to blur modernist conceptions of space, \nincluding divides of nature-culture, body-technology, or physical-political. For example, \nurban geography has witnessed a surfeit of work on urban socionatures, cyborg \nurbanisms, or urban metabolisms (e.g. Gandy, 2005; Swyngedouw, 2006), which \n 4 \nsometimes deploy the notion of assemblage. This use of assemblage tends to be largely \ndescriptive, and is echoed beyond geography \u2013 witness, for instance, Sassen\u201fs (2007) use \nof assemblage in Territory, Authority, Rights as an exploration of how particular mixes of \ntechnical and administrative practices extract and give intelligibility to new space by \nterritorialising and deterritorialsing milieu1. \n \nMore specifically, assemblage appears to be increasingly used to emphasise three inter-\nrelated sets of processes. First, assemblage emphasises gathering, coherence and \ndispersion. In particular, this draws attention to the labour of assembling and re-\nassembling sociomaterial practices that are diffuse, tangled and contingent (see for \ninstance Allen and Cochrane, 2008).  In this respect, assemblage emphasises spatiality and \ntemporality: elements are drawn together at a particular conjuncture only to disperse or \nrealign, and the shape shifts \u2013 as anthropologist Tania Murray Li (2007: 265) has put it \u2013 \naccording to place and the \u201eangle of vision\u201f.  Second, assemblage connotes groups, \ncollectives and, by extension, distributed agencies. As Jane Bennett (2005) has \npersuasively argued, assemblage names an uneven topography of trajectories that cross or \nengage each other to different extents over time, and which themselves exceed the \nassemblage.  This raises questions about where causality and responsibility lie in \nassemblage, and about how they should be conceived (I will return to this in the \nconclusion). Third, following Li (2007), in contrast to Foucauldian notions like \n                                                 \n1 There is of course a longer and more complex history of assemblage to be written here, the disparate \nelements of which may or may not be connected. Most obviously, this includes the Deleuzian reading of \nassemblage as a multiplicity that exceeds its component parts but which nonetheless retains elements of \nspecificity. There are other traditions of usage. For example, assemblage is used in archaeology to denote a \ngroup of different artefacts found in the same context, while in biology the term is used to connote micro- \nor macro-formations, such as the vertebrate skeletal muscle.  \n 5 \napparatus, regime, or governmental technology, assemblage connotes emergence rather \nthan resultant formation.  Part of the appeal of assemblage, it would seem, lies in its \nreading of power as multiple co-existences \u2013 assemblage connotes not a central \ngoverning power, nor a power distributed equally, but power as plurality in \ntransformation (I will elaborate on this later). \n \nOne particularly useful example of these three specific uses of assemblage is Ong and \nCollier\u201fs (2005) edited collection, Global Assemblages, which focuses on the specific \narticulation of \u201eglobal forms\u201f as territorialised assemblages.  For Collier and Ong (2005: \n4), assemblages are material, collective and discursive relationships, and in focussing on \nthe specificities of global forms in particular sites they are interested in the formation and \nreformation of assemblages as political and ethical \u201canthropological problems\u201d. \u201eGlobal \nforms\u201f are phenomena that are distinguished by their \u201ccapacity for decontextualization \nand recontextualization, abstractability and movement, across diverse social and cultural \nsituations and spheres of life\u201d (Collier and Ong, 2005: 7).  These forms can \u201ecode\u201f \nheterogenous contexts and objects, but are themselves limited and contested, and it is \nthis process that for them produces assemblages.  Global forms can include, for example, \nneoliberalism, international regulations and standards, the nation, class, citizenship, \ndemocracy, or certain ethical problems (e.g. access to water, or malnutrition).  \n \nIn an important passage, Collier and Ong (2005: 12) clarify the relation between global \nform and assemblage, including the question of their spatial templates:  \n \nIn relationship to \u201ethe global\u201f, the assemblage is not a \u201elocality\u201f to which broader forces are counterposed.  \nNor is it the structural effect of such forces.  An assemblage is the product of multiple determinations that \nare not reducible to a single logic.  The temporality of an assemblage is emergent.  It does not always \n 6 \ninvolve new forms, but forms that are shifting, in formation, or at stake.  As a composite concept, the term \n\u201eglobal assemblage\u201f suggests inherent tensions: global implies broadly encompassing, seamless and mobile; \nassemblage implies heterogeneous, contingent, unstable, partial and situated. \n \nThis passage is a useful clarification, particularly in its emphasis on assemblage as a \ncomposite and emergent concept. Any yet, despite their stated intention of avoiding \ncharacterising forms as \u201eglobal\u201f and assemblages as \u201elocal\u201f, assemblage is substantiated in \nthis account as a set of \u201ereflective practices\u201f  through which global forms are subjected to \ncritical questioning (Stark, 2002). In this move, the distinction between \u201eglobal\u201f and \n\u201eassemblage\u201f resurfaces. It is in this context that I am using the prefix \u201etranslocal\u201f as an \nattempt to blur, if not bypass, the scalar distinction between local and global (and in this \nsense, to also move beyond the provocative but peculiarly scalar distinction of \nassemblage found in De Landa\u201fs (2006) ontology, A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage \nTheory and Social Complexity).   \n \nIn using the analytic \u201etranslocal assemblage\u201f, I am signifying three orientations.  First, \nthey are composites of place-based social movements which exchange ideas, knowledge, \npractices, materials and resources across sites.  Second, translocal assemblage is an \nattempt to emphasise that translocal social movements are more than just the \nconnections between sites. Sites in translocal assemblages have more depth than the \nnotion of \u201enode\u201f or \u201epoint\u201f suggests (as connoted by network) in terms of their histories, \nthe labour required to produce them, and their inevitable capacity to exceed the \nconnections between other groups or places in the movement.  Third, they are not \nsimply a spatial category, output, or resultant formation, but signify doing, performance \nand events.  At different moments of time, these relations within and between sites may \nrequire different kinds of labour and are more or less vulnerable to collapse, or to \n 7 \nreassembling in different forms.  As Bennett (2005: 461) points out, drawing on Deleuze \nand Guattari (1986), this underlines the agency not just of each member of the \nassemblage, but of the groupings themselves: the milieu, or specific arrangement of \nthings, through which forces and trajectories inhere and transform.   \n \nThese three orientations offer a potentially distinct conceptualisation of spatiality from \nthat of \u201enetwork\u201f in accounts of social movements. Network has become the \npredominant lens through which to conceive social movements. For example, della Porta \nand Diani (1999: 14, cited in Nicholls, 2008: 844) state that \u201cnetworks contribute both to \ncreating the preconditions for mobilization and to providing the proper setting for the \nelaboration of specific world-views and lifestyles\u201d (see also Diani and McAdam, 2003). \nCumbers et al (2008: 184), in their excellent account of \u201eglobal justice networks\u201f, develop \na critical account of network ontology in relation to what they see as the \u201cflatter, \ndecentred, topological networks in much of the literature about an emergent global civil \nsociety\u201d, while Featherstone et al (2007) explore how a \u201enetwork perspective\u201f helps to \ntheorise transnationalism, including in relation to social movements. Juris (2008), in a \nbrilliant ethnography of social movements, shows how logics of horizontal networking \nare inscribed into the organizational architectures of translocal anti-corporate \nmovements, from the World Social Forum to People\u201fs Global Action and Indymedia \u2013 \nin this sense, networking can function as a democratising imperative within social \nmovements. Keck and Sikkink (1998: 241), in their influential study of transnational \nadvocacy networks, echo this when they depict \u201cmodern networks\u2026[as] vehicles for \ncommunicative and political exchange, with the potential for mutual transformation of \nparticipants\u201d. In these accounts and others, networks have become the de facto spatiality \nof social movements, figuring as a precondition and an infrastructure for social \n 8 \nmovements, and as an epistemic space through which to theorise the contested politics \nof social movements. \n \nIn exploring the distinctive contribution that assemblage might offer to accounts of \nspatiality within social movement, I will draw on the example of an urban social \nmovement from Mumbai to elaborate on translocal assemblage. This urban movement, \nfocussed on housing within informal settlements, is known as Slum\/Shack Dwellers \nInternational (SDI), and I draw especially on the Indian chapter of this movement \u2013 the \nAlliance - where much of the work of the movement started and which remains central \nto the movement more generally. The paper reflects on fieldwork conducted over several \nresearch visits to Mumbai, and especially two trips between November 2005 and June \n2006 and October 2001 and March 2002.  This research has focused on informal \nsettlements, infrastructure and social justice, and has involved a wide range of interviews \nwith state officials, NGOs and CBOs.  This has included repeated interviews and \nmeetings with members of the Indian Alliance and other members of SDI including \ndonors and partner groups in different cities and countries, as well as analysis of key grey \nliterature produced by the movement over the past 20 years about their work.  The vast \nmajority of these interviews took place in Mumbai and \u2013 in the case of SDI - other \nAlliance-linked sites in India, with some additional interviews in the UK with SDI \npartners and supporters.  In India, interviews took place with several members of the \nAlliance\u201fs leadership and community members, and with over 30 associated members.  \nRepeated interviews took place over several visits with the core Alliance leadership, \nmeaning that the interview material focussed more on SDI leadership rather than \ngrassroots membership, although not exclusively so.  I consider some of the \nconsequences for this for thinking about assemblages and social movements in the \nconclusion. \n 9 \n \nThe housing assemblage \nSDI is a learning movement based around a structure of exchanges, involving small \ngroups of the urban poor travelling from one urban settlement to another to share \nknowledge in what amounts to an informal learning process.  The movement espouses a \nrange of techniques that its leaders describe as indispensable to a development process \ndriven by the urban poor.  These include daily savings schemes, exhibitions of model \nhouse and toilet blocks, the enumeration of poor people's settlements, training \nprogrammes of exchanges, and a variety of other tactics.  Operating often in the context \nof a failure - deliberate or otherwise - of the state to ensure collective provision of \ninfrastructure, services and housing, SDI groups attempt to deal with the crisis of social \nreproduction in many cities of the global South.    \n \nA key organising strategy of SDI\u201fs is the construction and exhibition of full-size model \nhouses. This process of construction and exhibition, which incorporates designs by \norganisations operating within informal settlements, has circulated many of the more \nthan twenty countries in which SDI is based. Models and exhibitions hijack a middle-\nclass activity (Appadurai, 2002) and visibly dramatise the crisis of urban social \nreproduction, and are accompanied by informal discussions ranging from concerns over \nland tenure to construction or local organising. Models draw on domestic geographical \nimaginations and reflect a particular construction of the poor and of social change in SDI \n(McFarlane, 2004, 2008).  In particular, they put the capacities and skills of the poor on \npublic demonstration, creating an urban spectacle through which the poor are cast as \nentrepreneurial and capable of managing their own development. Figure 1 below shows \nan image of a SDI model house built for exhibition in Nairobi. \n \n 10 \nFigure 1: Model house, Nairobi (People's Dialogue, 2004) \n \nStories about how to construct model houses circulate SDI through an organised system \nof \u201ehorizontal exchanges\u201f through which groups of the urban poor from different cities \nshare ideas and experiences.  In exchanges, visiting groups often join-in on constructions \nand exhibitions as they are going on.  Strategies of measurement, or particular \nconstruction techniques, travel between sites during and after exchanges.  For example, \none strategy for people unfamiliar with tape measurers is to use clothes such as a sari as a \nmeasurement device.  Small-scale models, writes the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, \nan SDI partner, are often deployed as \u201ca three-dimensional imagining tool for people \nunfamiliar with the abstraction of scale drawings\u201d (ACHR, 2001: 13).  The models are \nexpressions of geographical imaginaries of the home.  ACHR go on to describe one \nexhibition in Thailand: \u201cAs the model went up, the people pulled out boards, nailed \nthings up differently, changed this, argued about that.  Measurements altered, ceiling \nheights were raised then lowered, window positions shifted, bathrooms and kitchens \nswelled then shrunk\u201d (ibid).  Models become the basis for negotiations around the kind \nof houses people want to live in, a process in which the collective will must be weighed \nagainst individual preferences, and which is subject to a range of social and cultural \nspecificities and alterations. \n \nThrough these travelling encounters between cities as different as Cape Town, Phnom \nPenh and Mumbai, SDI\u201fs work is a relational product that combines the codified and \ntacit, the social and the material, and the \u201ehere\u201f and \u201ethere\u201f.  The practices involved in \nconstructing, adapting and putting models to use is a process of learning through practice \nthat sits alongside practices of lobbying, fund raising, state and donor negotiations, \nmodes of solidarity, and so on.  Disparate knowledges and forms of identification, from \n 11 \nconstruction techniques to particular notions of the poor and social change, circulate \nexchanges.  In short, \u201ehorizontal exchanges\u201f, as they are often referred to in SDI, are \ntranslocal assemblages of materials, practices, designs, knowledge, personal stories, local \nhistories and preferences, and an infrastructure of resources, fund-raising, and state and \ndonor connections. Here, assemblage places an emphasis on agency, on the bringing \ntogether or forging alignments (Li, 2007) between the social and material, and between \ndifferent sites. As relational products that exceed the connections between sites, SDI \nmember groups are translocal assemblages that are place-focussed but not delimited to \nplace. \n \nIn SDI, the local context is the object of struggle.  As a placed-based but not place-\nrestricted movement, SDI\u201fs work resonates with Routledge\u201fs (2003) description of \n\u201econvergence spaces\u201f2.  Its leaders articulate an entrepreneurial form of collectivist \npolitics which emphasises the capacities and skills of the urban poor.  This collectivist \npolitics differs from Cumbers et al\u2019s (2008) discussion of \u201eGlobal Justice Networks\u201f as \nbound by opposition to neoliberalism (and see Featherstone, 2008).  SDI\u201fs politics is less \noppositional and is situated within existing local political economic frameworks through \nwhich it seeks to leverage space for the poor in urban planning and poverty reduction.  \n \n                                                 \n2 Routledge (2003) argues that a convergence space comprises a heterogeneous affinity between various \nsocial formations, such as social movements. By participating in spaces of convergence, \u201cactivists from \nparticipant movements embody their particular places of political, cultural, economic and ecological \nexperience with common concerns, which lead to expanded spatiotemporal horizons of action\u201d \n(Routledge, 2003: 346). He argues that convergence spaces comprise diverse social movements that \narticulate collective visions, facilitate uneven processes of facilitation and interaction, facilitate multi-scalar \npolitical action by participant movements, and that are comprised of contested social relations. \n 12 \nSDI is a series of overlapping translocal assemblages that conjoin in different ways at \ndifferent times. For example, the South African Alliance, another SDI group member, \nhave been very closely linked to the Indian Alliance over the past 15 years or so, and the \nrelations between these two translocal assemblages has changed during that time \ndepending on what was deemed important, whether in constructing model houses, or \ndeveloping community toilet block designs, or discussing fund-raising strategies or \nnegotiating strategies with the state, or in planning how best to conduct local savings \nschemes within informal settlements.  The spatialities of translocal assemblages, as I will \nargue in the next section, need to be understood through an open relational topology \nthat is alert both to the multiple spatial imaginaries and practices that SDI activists \ndeploy. \n \nRelational topologies of assemblage \nIn emphasising translocal assemblages as a means of conceptualising SDI\u201fs spatialities, I \nam not advertising any particular spatial imaginary, whether networked or scalar. Instead, \nunderstanding SDI\u201fs spatial imaginaries and practices requires an openness to how actors \nconstruct and move between different spatialities, and assemblage is a useful lens for \nretaining this openness. Indeed, a topological conception of spatiality, I would argue, \nshould be attentive to how scale or network, as particular spatial imaginaries, become key \ndevices used by actors as they attempt to structure or narrate assemblages (Legg, \nforthcoming; Leitner, et al, 2008).  While recent debates in geography have focussed on \nthe possible abandonment of scalar vocabularies in favour of, for instance, networks, \nmobilities, or flat ontologies (see Marston et al, 2005; Collinge, 2006; Escobar, 2006; \nJonas, 2006; Leitner and Miller, 2007; Jones et al, 2007), refusing to use scalar concepts is \na fruitless strategy given the prevalence of scalar narratives of political, economic, social \nand environmental relations that we encounter as researchers on a daily basis. As Allen \n 13 \nand Cochrane (2007) have argued in relation to their work on regions, the politics of \nscale is an epistemological fact, often deployed as a means of capturing or rationalising \ntangled, dispersed assemblages (and see Brenner, 2000; Swyngedouw, 1997, 2000). As \nLeitner et al (2008: 158, 165) write in their study of the spatialities of contentious politics: \n\u201cParticipants in contentious politics are enormously creative in cobbling together \ndifferent spatial imaginaries and strategies on the fly\u2026yet the co-implication of these \ndiverse spatialities remains at times underexposed, in the face of the tendency in \ncontemporary geographic scholarship either to privilege one particular spatiality, or to \nsubsume diverse spatialities under a single master concept\u201d. \n \nSDI members, for example, regularly construct scalar hierarchies of priorities in relation \nto political engagement, hierarchies that emphasise the paramount importance for them \nof the \u201elocal\u201f.  For SDI leaders, scale is neither ontology nor necessarily a vertical \nhierarchy that runs from the global to the body.  In geography, different \nconceptualisations of scale have been deployed in a variety of ways, and can be broadly \nsplit into accounts that deploy scale as an object of analysis (e.g. often with the guiding \nquesiton, how do social relations produce scale?) and scale as a narrative aid, and it is in \nthis second sense that SDI activists use scale when they produce scalar hierarchies that \nprivilege the local over the global.  Actor-network theorist John Law (2000, 2004) \nusefully refers to scalar hierarchies of priorities as transitivities.  Using a mathematical \nsense of the term, Law defines transitivity as referring to a set of relations in sequential \norder.  Transitivity is the production of order through a hierarchy, a \u201cdistribution that \nperforms itself\u201d (Law, 2000a: 344).  SDI leaders, especially as they increasingly engage in \nglobal advocacy, attempt to construct scalar transitivities that reflect their priorities.  \nIndeed, their route into global advocacy is often through reifying the local as the object \nof struggle for SDI members, and the distribution that runs hierarchically from local to \n 14 \nnational to global.   Patel, Burra, and D\u201fCruz (2001: 59), three SDI leaders, write for \nexample that \u201cwhen lessons are taken from the local to the global [for example, in \nengagements with UN Habitat], this is to ensure that the experience of the global \nprovides benefit to and strengthens the local\u201d, and that \u201cin spite of current global \nexplorations, the focus of the network will continue to be upon the local\u2026[SDI] is not a \nglobal process that focuses on international policies and practices, but it is global in \noutreach and strengthens groups\u201d (Patel, Burra and D\u201fCruz, 2001: 58-59).  At other \nmoments, SDI leaders use geographical imaginaries of particular scales \u2013 for example, the \nhome, in the shape of community designed models \u2013 as a basis for lobbying at the \u201eglobal \nscale\u201f. One bold example of this combination was the construction by SDI activists of a \nfull-sized model house in the lobby of the UN\u201fs New York headquarters during the 2001 \nHabitat conference (see Figure 2). \n \nFigure 2: SDI model house in lobby of UN, New York (Homeless International, 2001) \n \nScalar epistemologies influence political strategies and inflect the nature of particular \nspaces of political engagement.  For example, SDI activists are forced to ask how much \ntime and effort they should spend lobbying the UN or World Bank when they could be \narranging meetings with local municipalities or supporting local groups.  As an organising \nnarrative, scale is one means through which SDI leader seek to structure and \ncommunicate the nature of SDI\u201fs work. But scale does not operate as a master narrative \nfor SDI.  The metaphor of network is also strategically deployed by the movement\u201fs \nleaders, for instance in their invocation of SDI as \u201ehorizontal\u201f and non-hierarchical, and \nthis use of horizontality is itself attractive to donors and advocates of SDI (and on the \nseduction of networks, see Henry et al, 2004; Thompson, 2004).  SDI\u201fs work entails a \nconstant shifting and sifting of spatial imaginaries of networks, hierarchies, and scales.  \n 15 \nThese narratives can serve to metaphorically capture, unite and make singular \u2013 if only \ntemporarily \u2013 translocal assemblages. These metaphors also contrast with the spatial \nmetaphors deployed by activists in SDI who aren\u201ft leaders when they speak of the \nmovement. Activists, for example in relation to the Mumbai groups, might speak of \n\u201eFederation\u201f or \u201eMahila Milan\u201f (meaning \u201eWomen Together\u201f in Hindi). Different spatial \nmetaphors - which themselves have different influences, appeal and temporality - reflect \ndistinct narratives and imaginaries of assemblages.  \n \nAssemblage offers the possibility of moving away from particular spatial master concepts \n\u2013 which often structure the discussion of space in relation to social movements \u2013 and in \nthis sense offer one potential response to Leitner et al\u2019s (2008) call.  To echo Doreen \nMassey (2005: 189, 100), the view of space at work here is less space as resultant \nformation and more as a \u201cmultiplicity of stories-so-far\u2026The openended interweaving of \na multiplicity of trajectories (themselves thereby in transformation), the concomitant \nfractures, ruptures and structural divides\u201d, which makes space \u201cso unamenable to a single \ntotalising project\u201d.  If this points to a relational topology of translocal assemblage as \n\u201ccoeval becomings\u201d, in Massey\u201fs (2005: 189) phrasing, it is nonetheless structured \nthrough power relations and information control, and it is to these powers of assemblage \nthat I now turn.  \n \nPowers of assemblage \nTranslocal learning assemblages are structured through various forms of power relation \nand resource and information control. There are, of course, a variety of theoretical \nresources for conceptualising the role of power across distances in social movements.  As \npart of this relational topology, I argue for an understanding of translocal power that \ndraws on but that seeks to move beyond any singular conception of power, whether of \n 16 \nhegemony or governmentality \u2013 the predominant ways in which power-over-distance is \ntheorised in accounts of social movements as networks.  There is not the space to review \nthese accounts here, but in general terms these two broad approaches entail particular \nassumptions about how the \u201enear\u201f and \u201efar\u201f are connected.  \n \nAccounts of hegemony have deployed or echoed particular readings of both Gramsci \nand Foucault.  Neo-Gramscian perspectives, for example, emphasise the relationship \nbetween powerful institutions, states, and ideas (Boas and McNeill, 2004; Taylor, 2004).  \nThe argument here is often to identify neoliberalism as a largely coherent project: a \nhegemonic ideology that seeks to ferment consensus around discourses such as 'good \ngovernance' based on coercion and consent (Taylor 2004).  In these accounts, power \nradiates from an authoritative centre that instils stability and order by recasting the \nperiphery in its own image, and the assumption is that power is effective and extensive.  \nWe are told little about how power is exercised at distance.  This has echoes of what \nAllen (2003; 2004), in his work on power, has called the \u201epowers of the centre\u201f, an \nepistemological move where the capacity to do something comes to stand for the actual \nexercise of power, often implying rather than explaining what actually goes on in the \noperation of power.   \n \nIn accounts of power-as- governmentality within literature on social movements, power \nis identified in relation to new forms of conduct, behaviour and ethics around ideas of a \nparticular (often Western) modernity (e.g. civilization, progress, rationality) (e.g. Escobar, \n1995; Ferguson, 1994, 2006; Watts, 2003). These readings are particularly concerned with \nthe ways in which certain \u201eproblems\u201f are rendered by the state, international agencies or \nsocial movement leaders through certain discursive performances, and the ways in which \nparticular \u201esolutions\u201f are posed in response.  This entails close study of the practices \n 17 \nthrough which modes of power are articulated and contested through different sites and \ninstitutions, rather than conceiving of different agents as necessarily operating in separate \narenas. This allows, first, the possibility of different forms of power operating \nsimultaneously, including those that may contradict one another (e.g. conformity and \nresistance; control and bargaining), and, second, the possibility that power can operate \nacross sites in ways that problematises analytic divisions like global-local, or state-civil \nsociety.  However, there is an occasional tendency to reduce social action and subjectivity \nto effects, and there is little scope for the pro-active role of short and long-term \nindividual and collective action in provoking changes in modes of development, policy or \nregulation (see Barnett, 2005, on neoliberalism).  \n \nIn SDI\u201fs translocal assemblages, there may be multiple forms of power involved at \ndifferent times, not all of which are necessarily translocal in reach, and which become \nstabilised or contested in different ways.  Allen\u201fs (2003) work usefully points to a range \nof different powers, including domination, authority, manipulation, and seduction, all of \nwhich are different in their character and reach.  Domination works to quickly close \ndown choices and may be more effective across distance, while authority works most \neffectively through proximity and presence, drawing people into line on a daily basis and \nseeking the internalization of particular norms.  Authority\u201fs need for constant recognition \nmeans that the more direct the presence, the more direct the impact.  Conversely, the \nlarger the number of outside interests to negotiate, the more varied the mix of resources, \nthe greater the potential for authority to be disrupted.  Manipulation can have a greater \nspatial reach than authority partly because it may involve the concealment of intent, such \nas in a corporate advertising campaign or corporate development intervention, and partly \nbecause it does not require the internalisation of norms.  Seduction is a more modest \nform of power that can operate successfully with spatial reach, \u201cwhere the possibility of \n 18 \nrejection or indifference are central to its exercise\u201d (Allen, 2004: 25). These different \nmodes of power are mediated in space and time, so that manipulation may become (or \nmay be misread as), for instance, seduction or authority.   \n \nThere are of course many other modes of power. Inducement may involve financial \nincentives to obtain compliance, such as in state contracting of NGOs (Ferguson and \nGupta, 2002), while coercion may include monitoring or target-setting, for example in \ndonor aid monitoring of states or NGOs (Mawdsley et al, 2001).  Power may be \ninstrumental, a series of actions designed to make others act in ways that would they \notherwise have not, or associational, involving the formation of a common will.  These \ndifferent modes of power work alongside, build on, and extend accounts of power over \ndistance as hegemony or governmentality, but most importantly they emphasise the \nmultiple and often simultaneous transformation of power across space, and it is in this \nsense that it is useful for a relational topology of translocal assemblages.  \n \nPower operates in multiple ways though SDI\u201fs travelling strategies such as exhibition, \ninfluenced by personal and group relations and perceptions.  Exhibition can act as a form \nof seduction, recruiting local people to SDI groups by raising curiosity around a high-\nprofile and unusual event - this is the case in Mumbai, for example.  Model houses travel \nas part of exchanges and can act as a form of inducement for other SDI groups in other \ncountries.  At a more general level, the Mumbai SDI group - the Alliance - has come to \nrepresent for many SDI groups a kind of authority in SDI, as an originator and crucible \nof ideas.  In interview, some comments from key Indian Alliance members appeared to \nindicate a tendency to view knowledge and ideas as disseminating from Mumbai across \nSDI.  For example, one Mumbai leader said: \u201cWhat you have to do is see Mumbai as a \nhub that\u201fs like the crucible.  All the new ideas [e.g. housing exhibitions, enumerations, \n 19 \nsavings]\u2026it\u201fs the most difficult place to work\u2026the size of the city, the scale of the \nproblem, a very dense environment\u2026If you can solve something in Mumbai you can \nsolve it in other places, and that\u201fs one of the reasons that we are not anywhere else\u201d.  On \nanother occasion, the same leader referred to Mumbai as \u201cthe mother base\u201d, while other \nMumbai leaders have referred to the Alliance as a \u201cmodel\u201d that is being adopted across \nSDI.  This narrative can be described as a form of power that is both manipulative and \nassociational. It is manipulative in that it is presented as a neutral set of facts and \nconstitutes a simple message with extensive spatial reach. It is associational in that it \ninvolves an attempt to constitute a common agreement or shared will, i.e. that the \nMumbai Alliance should lead the movement. While the Mumbai Alliance has certainly \nbeen the source of many of the strategies circulating SDI, to say that it has driven or \ncaused SDI activities in this way is an exaggeration that speaks to an ongoing debate in \nSDI over the extent of influence of the Indian group over the direction of the \nmovement.  \n \nWhile knowledge is explicitly conceived by SDI leaders as changing as it travels, in \npractice groups occasionally attempt a direct copying of what they have seen elsewhere.  \nBut if we shift from the Mumbai office of the SDI leader quoted above to a different \nSDI site, we see associational power being contested. For example, in the Piesang River \narea of South Africa a member of the SDI group, the Homeless People\u201fs Housing \nFederation, \u201cexplained that the visitors from India had advised them to build communal \nwater points, as a collective space where women could talk about the Federation \u2013 \nhowever, the Federation women of Piesang River had their minds set on the \nconventional on-site access to water, and this had remained their demand\u201d \n(Huchzermeyer, 1999: unpublished, no pagination).  This indicates a tension in SDI that \ncan be understood as forms of micro-resistance to associational power:  on the one hand, \n 20 \nSDI seeks to encourage autonomy and change as knowledge travels; on the other hand, \nthere is the possibility of travelling knowledge marginalising local concerns, and in this \ncontext charismatic leaders can play an ambivalent role in exchanges.   \n \nWithin SDI member groups, particular groups of people have become more influential, \nand if not controlling the direction of the movement they certainly contribute far more \nthan other groups. For example, some people have become key illustrators of the \nmovement\u201fs strategies.  The Asian Coalition of Housing Rights, an SDI partner, has \ndescribed these groups as \u201cvanguard communities\u201d, key actors in SDI that play an \nimportant role in mediating learning about key strategies in different sites across SDI \n(daily savings, enumeration etc) by circulating exchanges:  \n \nThe ones up at the front of the line, the innovators, the risk takers, the go-getters.  So in Bombay, you \nhave your Byculla Mahila Milan [Woman Together], and in Pune [India] there's Rajendranagar.  Then \nSouth Africa has its Philippi and Zimbabwe has its Mbare. In Phnom Penh you have Toul Svay Prey and \nin the Philippines it's Payatas.  These communities become demonstration centers and hosts of \ninnumerable exchange visits (ACHR, 2000: 9). \n \nThe use of these kinds of groups in exchange has the consequence of implying that these \nare more learned and worldly members of SDI, and certainly reflects the organisational \nresource dominance of particular people in SDI who constitute what Cumbers et al \n(2008: 196) refer to as \u201cimagineers\u201d \u2013 key organising and communicative activists within \nsocial movements. The discursive construction of these groups entails the simultaneous \nexpression of seductive power, manipulation and inducement.  It is seductive in that is a \nmodest form of power that can operate successfully with spatial reach, \u201cwhere the \npossibility of rejection or indifference are central to its exercise\u201d (Allen, 2004: 25). It is \nmanipulative in that it seeks to reproduce a similar set of discourses and practices across \n 21 \nthe movement through attributing the status of \u201eteacher\u201f to particular groups. Finally, it \nconstitutes inducement in that it presents a set of incentives in the form of \u201edo as we say, \nand a better life is possible\u201f.  \n \nConclusion \nThis paper has outlined a particular conception of translocal assemblages by drawing on \none distinct urban social movement based in and beyond Mumbai.  The work of these \ngroups is based predominantly on forms of group exchange involving people, materials, \nresources, histories, and struggles, and calls for an approach that works with more \nmultiple conceptions of space and power than is often the case in accounts of social \nmovements (and see Leitner, et al, 2008).  In closing, I will highlight four broad potential \nimplications of the analytic of translocal assemblage for understanding social movements. \n \nFirst, translocal assemblage is a relational analytic that is open to multiple spatial \nimaginaries and practices. It does not privilege a particular master concept, such as \nnetwork or scale. Rather, it is open to how different actors and activists narrativise \nassemblages through spatial metaphors and organising logics of, for example, scale, \nnetwork, federation and so on.  In this sense, retaining assemblage as a broad descriptor \nresponds to Leitner et al\u2019s (2008) call for geographers to be more attentive to the multiple \nspatial imaginaries that the people we research themselves deploy. \n \nSecond, if \u201enetwork\u201f is the lens generally used to conceptualise the spatialities of social \nmovements, assemblage potentially offers a different emphasis. In particular, unlike \nnetwork, assemblage does more than emphasise a set of connections between sites in \nthat it draws attention to history, labour, materiality and performance.  Assemblage \npoints to reassembling and disassembling, to dispersion and transformation, processes \n 22 \noften overlooked in network accounts.  In part, this means translocal assemblage can go \nsome way to resolving the tension of interiority \/ exteriority that often surfaces in \naccounts of networks, because translocal assemblages emerge in part through the \nincorporation of exteriorities \u2013 for example in the production of political stances or \nknowledges.  For instance, the Indian Alliance often distinguishes it\u201fs work from other, \nmore leftist urban movements in Mumbai, and in doing so that particular exteriority \nenters into the constitution of the Alliance as translocal assemblages (both De Landa, \n2006, and Bennett, 2005, briefly discuss exteriority and assemblage). \n \nThird, the analytic of translocal assemblage clearly has implications for how we conceive \nagency in social movements. As Jane Bennett (2005) argues, assemblage focuses attention \non the distributive and composite nature of agency.  This is an agency both of sums and \ndistinctive parts. Bennett uses Deleuze\u201fs notion of \u201eadsorbsion\u201f to capture this \u2013 a \ngathering of elements in way that both forms a coalition and yet preserves something of \nthe agency or impetus of each element. In addition, assemblages are emergent, nonlinear \nand processual rather than resultant formations, placing agency less in the realm of direct \ncauses and more in the realm of sources which come together in particular events (such \nas housing exhibitions in the case of SDI). Tania Murray Li (2007: 285) echoes this by \ndrawing attention to Deleuze and Guattari\u201fs reading of diffused agency in which material \ncontent (e.g. bodies, actions, and passions) and enunciations (e.g. statements, plans and \nlaws) are linked not in linear fashion but rhizomatically as reciprocal presuppositions and \nmutual connections play themselves out in the constitution of the social field.  \n \nHowever, the question of agency also points to a danger with assemblage. In conceiving \nagency as distributed socially, spatially and materially, there is the risk of failing to identify \nimportant actors or key explanatory causes in social movements. In this sense, \n 23 \nassemblage focuses attention more on the \u201ehow\u201f questions rather than the \u201ewhy\u201f \nquestions. In accounts of assemblage, there is a tension between a materialist ontology \nthat emphasises distribution of agency, and a tendency to centre the human, or groups of \nhumans, as the basis or arbiter of causation and responsibility. This is a tension which my \nown account speaks to \u2013 in order to examine the spatialities of the urban movements I \nhave discussed in this paper, I have returned to particular people, leaders, and voices \nwithin the movements to illustrate my case, reflecting particular methodological and \nanalytical choices.  Assemblage, then, is a useful frame for thinking the problem of \nagency in accounts of social movements or indeed politics more generally, presenting at \nits simplest level a choice between an exploratory materialist ontology or a resurfacing of \nhuman causality and responsibility.  \n \nFourth, and finally, translocal assemblage offers a distinctive reading of social \nmovements, in that it forces attention on who or what has the capacity to assemble. In a \ngiven social movement, different people have more or less capacity to call upon financial \nresources or personal contacts, to speak from a position of authority, or to promote or \nparticipate in the practices that go on. In this sense, assemblage is both an analytic and a \nresource mediated by power and characterised by changing relations of stability and flux. \nFor example, many urban social movements in Mumbai are mobilised and led by middle-\nclass activists in positions of relative power, with particular formal educational \nattainments, connections in government or with donors, and distinct resources that they \ncan draw upon.  \n \n \n \n 24 \nReferences \nAllen, J. 2003 Lost geographies of power.
