One \nimportant theoretical ship that has recently set sail again is the idea that \nsome very poor countries appear to be caught in a poverty trap requiring a \n\u201cbig push\u201d from foreign aid in order to escape. A case in point is a 2004 \narticle by Jeffrey Sachs and colleagues; as discussed later in this article, \nSachs et al. make extensive use of a modifi ed Solow model to provide theo-\nretical support for increasing the fl ow of foreign aid to sub-Saharan Africa \n(SSA). There is a strong similarity between Sachs et al. 2004 and Rich-\nard Nelson\u2019s infl uential paper from 1956, the same year in which Solow\u2019s \ncontribution appeared. Nelson\u2019s model of a \u201clow level equilibrium trap\u201d \npersuaded many economists that developing countries would need sub-\nstantial infl ows of external assistance if they were to escape extreme pov-\nerty and begin the process of sustained growth.\nThe burgeoning contemporary research into the causes of economic \ngrowth, poverty traps, and convergence clubs, as well as the need to iden-\ntify the deeper determinants of substantial cross-country differentials in \nincome per capita, has brought the Solow model, and modifi cations thereof, \ninto the heart of the contemporary development debate after decades of \nneglect in this fi eld. This article reviews and provides a critical commen-\ntary on the literature relating to the Solow model, economic development, \npoverty traps, and the case for foreign aid as a solution to the SSA growth \ntragedy.\nThe Solow Model and the Economics \nof Development\nThe importance of economic growth as a necessary condition for sus-\ntained improvements in human material welfare and poverty reduction is \nconfi rmed by numerous empirical studies (Dollar and Kraay 2002). When \nit comes to investigating the proximate causes of growth, the dynamics \nof transition to steady states, and the potential for catch-up and conver-\ngence between low- and high-income per capita countries, Solow\u2019s model, \ntogether with subsequent extensions and refi nements, has proved an invalu-\nable and adaptable framework of analysis. The model is parsimonious, \nrigorous, and fl exible, and provides many useful insights into the causes \nof economic growth (Mankiw 1995). And yet, although the neoclassical \ngrowth model was central to the 1960s growth accounting debates relating \nto the high-income developed nations, strangely, and in sharp contrast to \nthe highly visible Harrod-Domar (H-D) model, compared with today, the \nThe Solow Model, Poverty Traps, and Foreign Aid 243\nSolow growth model is largely inconspicuous in the mainstream develop-\nment literature during the period 1956\u201385. For example, in the classic and \nwidely used collections of readings edited by Amar Agarwala and Sampat \nSingh (1971, fi rst published in 1958), and Ian Livingstone (1971), there is \nno discussion of the Solow model. Further evidence that the Solow model \nplayed little part in the early development literature comes from Diana \nHunt, who in her 1989 survey notes that \u201cneoclassical growth theory is not \nsurveyed here, partly because it did not form part of the intellectual heri-\ntage of development economists in the 1940s and early 1950s, but also \nbecause it has had no appreciable infl uence on development economics\u201d \n(34; emphasis added).\nWhy did development economics and growth theory evolve along sepa-\nrate paths for almost three decades in the post-1956 period? Building on \nPaul Krugman\u2019s (1992) insightful analysis, Solow (1999, 275) offers the \nfollowing explanation:\nOn the whole the personality types in the profession who became inter-\nested in economic development were not model builders. They were col-\nlectors of data and generalizers from rough empirical data, like Simon \nKuznets; or they were like Ted Schultz, really deeply into underdevel-\noped agriculture, or they were people interested in history and back-\nwardness for its own sake. That sort of temperament is not suited to \nmodel building. Growth theory par excellence, yielded to model build-\ning. So even Arthur Lewis thought of his 1954 paper as a minor sideline \nto his book The Theory of Economic Growth (1955). The people who \ngot interested in the theory of economic growth were interested in model \nbuilding.\nToday the situation is very different. Since the mid-1980s, interest in the \nSolow model, and model building in general, among development econ-\nomists has revived. Although the H-D model still fi nds a place in most \ndevelopment textbooks, it rarely warrants much more than a passing com-\nment in modern macro or growth textbooks (e.g., compare the brief dis-\ncussion in Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004 with the extensive treatment in \nJones 1975). Unlike the years of \u201chigh development theory\u201d (Krugman \n1992), the Solow model now receives extensive treatment in most text-\nbooks on economic development (e.g., compare Higgins 1959 with Perkins, \nRadelet, and Lindauer 2006). In large part this can be attributed to the ver-\nsatility of Solow\u2019s model and the insights it provides on the convergence-\ndivergence debate (Islam 2003). Although dominated by the Solow and \n244 Brian Snowdon\n1. Mauro Boianovsky (2010) defi nes capital fundamentalism as \u201cthe notion that physical \ncapital accumulation, instead of technical change or investment in human capital, determines \nthe rate of growth of income per capita.\u201d\nRomer models, another notable change is the welcome and growing ten-\ndency in macro and growth textbooks to give increasing attention to the \n\u201cdeeper\u201d political economy determinants of growth and development \n(see, e.g., Acemoglu 2008).\nWhat were the main infl uences that led Solow (2007, 4) into the research \nthat culminated in his 1956 \u201ccontribution to the theory of economic \ngrowth\u201d? According to Solow (1999), he became interested in growth for \nthree main reasons. First, in the early 1950s many economists were becom-\ning increasingly absorbed in the daunting economic problems facing the \ndeveloping countries. However, in terms of his own research, Solow became \n\u201cpassively\u201d rather than \u201cactively\u201d interested in economic development (\u201cI \ngot to thinking about development issues and I had read Arthur Lewis\u201d). \nSecond, Solow\u2019s linear programming research with Robert Dor man and \nPaul Samuelson (1958) stimulated his thinking about intertemporal opti-\nmization and economic growth. Third, Solow (1999, 273\u201374) was \u201csus-\npicious of the Harrod-Domar model. . . . I thought there must be a way \nof modelling growth that does not have the knife edge property of the \nHarrod-Domar model.\u201d\nWhile Solow never intended his model to address the specifi c prob-\nlems facing developing countries, it does provide a coherent framework \nfor thinking about the connection between growth, capital accumulation, \nand economic development. Capital accumulation was already central in \nthe 1950s development models of Harrod-Domar, Walt Rostow, Ragnar \nNurkse, and Arthur Lewis (Meier 2005). However, when there are dimin-\nishing returns to the accumulation of capital, a policy emphasis on increas-\ning investment-GDP ratios will not lead to sustained economic growth; \nrather, long-run growth is driven by (exogenous) technological progress. \nTherefore it is hardly surprising that Solow\u2019s one-sector neoclassical growth \nmodel failed to have a substantial impact on the development literature, \ngiven this was an era of development thinking heavily infl uenced by dual-\nsector models, surplus labor, structuralism, and \u201ccapital fundamentalism\u201d \n(King and Levine 1994).1\nIn his thought-provoking tale of \u201ceconomists\u2019 misadventures in the trop-\nics,\u201d Bill Easterly (2001) provides a stinging critique of \u201ccapital fundamen-\ntalism.\u201d Because of diminishing returns, Solow\u2019s growth model contains \nThe Solow Model, Poverty Traps, and Foreign Aid 245\nthe \u201csurprising\u201d result that investment is not the key to long-run growth, \neven if it plays a role in the transition to the steady-state growth path. How-\never, this \u201cshocker\u201d failed to infl uence the thinking of the development \n\u201cexperts\u201d in the major international fi nancial institutions who mistakenly \ncontinue to view the \u201caccumulation of productive assets\u201d as the \u201cfounda-\ntion of economic growth.\u201d\nAugmenting the Solow Model: \nFrom Solow to Romer, Barro, and Mankiw\nThe revival of interest in growth theory and empirics since the mid-1980s \nhas had a signifi cant infl uence on the economic development literature as \nwell as reigniting interest in the Solow model as a versatile framework for \ninvestigating the issue of convergence. While part of this revival of interest \nin growth analysis refl ected the return of macroeconomic stabilization in \nthe developed economies during the 1980s, it also refl ects the intellectual \nstimulus provided by the new endogenous growth theories. Even though \nthese models were more about developed than developing countries, in his \nseminal paper Paul Romer (1986) highlights the growing body of evidence \nsupporting the lack of convergence in per capita incomes between devel-\noped and developing countries. This was a signifi cant contributing factor \ninfl uencing Romer\u2019s quest to construct a growth model based on increasing \nreturns. Indeed, the existence of convergence and divergence clubs is one \nof the key stylized facts of international economic development that has \nallowed the Solow model to become a central component in the debate on \nthe evolution of world inequality.\nIn response to Romer\u2019s challenge to the conventional neoclassical the-\nory of growth, Greg Mankiw, David Romer, and David Weil (1992) devel-\noped their \u201cmodifi ed\u201d Solow model that can explain international differ-\nences in growth rates as the result of convergence to different steady states \nand is consistent with the idea that \u201cthe accumulation of capital broadly \ndefi ned is the key to international differences in economic growth rates\u201d \n(Mankiw 1995, 308). However, the biggest push toward integrating the \nmodern analysis of growth and development was given by Robert Barro\u2019s \n(1991) highly infl uential cross-country regression paper. Barro\u2019s cross-\ncountry empirical work was fi rmly embedded in the extended Solow neo-\nclassical model; a major fi nding from his research is that the \u201cneoclassical \nmodel\u2019s central idea of conditional convergence receives strong support \nfrom the data.\u201d As Barro (1997, x) observes, \u201cIt is surely an irony that one \n246 Brian Snowdon\nof the lasting contributions of endogenous growth theory is that it stimu-\nlated empirical work that demonstrated the explanatory power of the neo-\nclassical growth model.\u201d While Solow (1999) remains \u201cvery suspicious\u201d \nof cross-country regression results, the new empirical literature focus-\ning on the convergence issue undoubtedly created a synergy between the \ngrowth and development literature and was a major infl uence in placing \nthe Solow model at the heart of modern discussions of economic develop-\nment, including the SSA \u201cgrowth tragedy\u201d (Mankiw 1995; Snowdon and \nVane 2005).\nThe Sub-Saharan Growth Tragedy\nThe lack of signifi cant progress in SSA is the outstanding development \nfailure of the last quarter of the twentieth century relative to the expecta-\ntions and aspirations present at the time of decolonization. This problem \nremains the greatest development challenge facing the world in the twenty-\nfi rst century (Easterly and Levine 1997; Artadi and Sala-i-Martin 2003; \nSala-i-Martin 2006). As Angus Maddison\u2019s (2004) data reveal, although \nduring the relatively stable period, 1950\u201373, GDP per capita growth in \nAfrica was a respectable 2 percent, this fell to a dismal 0.19 percent for the \nperiod 1972\u20132001. This is in sharp contrast to the well-documented \u201cmir-\nacle\u201d growth experienced by the East Asian economies.\nThe reasons for the poor economic performance of most of SSA since \nthe decolonization period remain highly controversial. Paul Collier and \nJan Gunning (1999) consider several plausible explanations:\n 1.  adverse external infl uences and conditions including the legacy \nof colonialism, slavery (Nunn 2008), \u201cCold War\u201d politics, and the \nrestrictive trade policies of high income countries;\n 2.  terms of trade volatility and heavy dependence on a small number \nof primary exports;\n 3.  damaging economic policies, including protectionism, excessive reg-\nulations, fi scal profl igacy, incentives to \u201crent seeking\u201d and \u201cdirectly \nunproductive\u201d behavior, hostility toward FDI, and excessive public \nownership and statism;\n 4.  unfavorable demographic factors, especially rapid population \ngrowth;\n 5.  geographical constraints, relating to climate, soils, topography and \ndisease ecology, the \u201cnatural resource curse,\u201d and the problems faced \nby countries landlocked by hostile neighbors;\nThe Solow Model, Poverty Traps, and Foreign Aid 247\n 6.  internal political instability, authoritarianism, corruption, bureau-\ncratic ineffi ciency, poor governance and lack of accountable dem-\nocratic institutions;\n 7.  ethnic diversity, absence of trust and lack of social capital;\n 8.  lack of adequate physical and social infrastructure, failure to pro-\nvide secure property rights and contract enforcement.\nWhile growth theory and the experience of East Asia suggest that SSA \ncountries have enormous potential for catch-up and convergence, this \npotential is unlikely to materialize in countries with inadequate growth-\nsupporting political and economic institutions. However, Jeffrey Sachs \n(2005, 2008) has recently become the leading advocate of the argument \nthat SSA is caught in a \u201cpoverty trap\u201d that requires a \u201cbig push\u201d to escape \nvia a substantial increase in foreign aid fl ows. Moreover, by using modifi -\ncations to the Solow model to make their case, Sachs et al. (2004) illustrate \njust how versatile the neoclassical theoretical framework can be when dis-\ncussing a major issue in development theory and policy.\nThe Foreign Aid Controversy: \nFrom Harrod-Domar to the Solow Model\nOne long-running controversy in development economics, where the Solow \nmodel has now become central to the debate, relates to the role that foreign \naid can play in helping low-income countries escape from extreme poverty. \nWhile economists agree that a necessary condition for the elimination of \nextreme poverty is sustained economic growth, the idea that a substantial \nincrease in the fl ow of foreign aid, to regions such as SSA, is necessary to \npromote such growth remains highly controversial. Indeed the debate relat-\ning to the effectiveness of foreign aid in promoting growth and develop-\nment remains plagued with problems relating to causality, measurement, \nand ideology (Friedman 1958; Bauer 1971; Easterly 2006b; Riddell 2007).\nDuring the first two \u201cdevelopment decades\u201d (1950\u201370) the case for \nincreasing foreign aid to stimulate economic growth and escape from a \nlow-level equilibrium initially centered on the H-D model rather than the \nSolow model. The \u201ccapital fundamentalism\u201d of the H-D model became a \nkey ingredient within the framework of development planning and the \nestimation of aid requirements. The implications of this simple growth \nmodel were dramatic and somewhat reassuring. The problem of generating \nan increase in economic growth could be achieved by simply increasing \nthe resources devoted to capital accumulation.\n248 Brian Snowdon\nThe familiar H-D growth equation, G = s\/v, simply states that the growth \nrate (G) of GDP is jointly determined by the savings ratio (s) and the incre-\nmental capital-output ratio (ICOR = v). The higher the savings (investment) \nratio and the lower the ICOR, the faster will an economy grow. For exam-\nple, if a developing country desired to achieve a target growth rate of per \ncapita income, \u0394(Y\/P), of 2 percent per annum (i.e., a growth target that \nwill ensure that living standards double every thirty-fi ve years), and popu-\nlation (P) is estimated to be growing at n = 2 percent per annum, then \neconomic planners could calculate the savings rate required to achieve a \ntarget rate of aggregate GDP growth (G*) equal to 4 percent according to \nequation (1).\nG* = [\u0394(Y\/P) + n] = s*\/v. (1)\nIf v = 4, this implies that G* will be realized only with a desired savings \nratio (s*) of 0.16, or 16 percent of GDP (i.e., G*v = s*). If s* > s, there is \na \u201csavings (foreign exchange) gap,\u201d and planners would need to devise \npolicies to plug this gap (Chenery and Strout 1966). If domestic sources \nof fi nance proved inadequate to achieve G*, then foreign aid could fi ll \nthe savings gap. As (2) illustrates, aid requirements (Ar) could simply be \ncalculated as s* \u2212 s = Ar.\nG* = [s + Ar]\/v1 = s*\/v.  (2)\nIt is assumed in such formulations that the boost given to growth by an \ninjection of aid resources will eventually cause a jump in the domestic \nsavings rate such that self-sustaining growth is achieved, thereby ending \nthe need for further aid infl ows.\nHowever, a major weakness of the H-D approach is the assumption of \na stable ICOR. Aid infl ows are likely to raise the ICOR (lower the produc-\ntivity of capital) as a result of channeling aid into easy-to-monitor, large, \nprestigious projects that will stand as monuments to the generosity of the \npolitically motivated donors (Griffi n 1970). Economists soon became \naware of a second major fl aw in the \u201caid requirements\u201d or \u201cfi nancing gap\u201d \nmodel. The model assumes that aid infl ows are channeled into investment, \none-to-one. But it quickly became apparent that foreign aid, with the objec-\ntive of closing the savings gap, did not necessarily boost total savings and \nin many cases reduced domestic savings (Easterly 2006b). This is equiv-\nalent to a proportion (\u03b1c) of the aid infl ow being consumed, that is, aid is \nhighly fungible (see Griffi n 1970; Boone 1996). As equation (3) illustrates, \nif aid has a negative impact on the ICOR, and a signifi cant proportion of \nThe Solow Model, Poverty Traps, and Foreign Aid 249\nthe aid is consumed, the impact of aid on growth is substantially reduced \nand could even be negative.\nG = [s + (1 \u2212 \u03b1c)Ar]\/v2, (3)\nwhere \u03b1c is large, and v2 > v1. In this \u201cpessimistic\u201d scenario, G* is unlikely \nto be achieved via attempts to boost domestic savings with infl ows of \nforeign aid (Snowdon 2007).\nIgnoring these early doubts, the case for increasing foreign aid has \nreemerged as a major international policy issue and is linked, via modi-\nfi cations to the standard Solow model, to the idea that some developing \ncountries are trapped in a permanent condition of poverty.\nPoverty Traps, Foreign Aid, \nand the Sachs-Solow Model\nIn a recent infl uential paper, Jeffrey Sachs et al. (2004) argue that most \nSSA countries are caught in a \u201cpoverty trap\u201d that is heavily infl uenced by \ngeographically rooted low agricultural productivity, heavy disease bur-\ndens, and relative physical isolation. In such circumstances, the optimistic \nneoclassical vision that market forces combined with improved gover-\nnance can remedy the development problem in many very poor countries, \nirrespective of their initial poverty, is rejected. A practical solution requires \ntargeted investments, large in scale and fi nanced by foreign aid, in infra-\nstructure, disease control, and selective measures to promote a \u201cgreen revo-\nlution\u201d in agriculture.\nThat poor countries can be caught in a poverty trap is of course an old \nidea in economics, dating back at least to 1798 and the work of Thomas \nMalthus. During the 1950s this idea was revived by Ragnar Nurkse (1953) \nas the \u201cvicious circle of poverty\u201d model, and also in the infl uential paper \nby Richard Nelson (1956), whose theory of a \u201clow level equilibrium trap\u201d \nwas used to explain persistent poverty. Nelson suggests that \u201cforeign assis-\ntance, together with internal change, can play an important role in boost-\ning an economy from the hold of the trap\u201d (904).\nPoverty traps (multiple equilibria) represent self-reinforcing ineffi cient \nsteady-state equilibria at low levels of per capita income and can arise \nfrom a variety of sources, including both market and institutional failure \n(Azariadis and Stachurski 2005; Azariadis 2006). Paul Collier (2007) \nidentifi es four signifi cant \u201ctraps\u201d that ensnare the \u201cbottom billion\u201d of the \nworld\u2019s population, namely, \u201cinternal confl ict traps,\u201d \u201cnatural resource \n250 Brian Snowdon\ntraps,\u201d \u201clandlocked by bad neighbour traps,\u201d and \u201cbad governance traps.\u201d \nOne of the simplest and best-known poverty-trap mechanisms runs from \nextreme poverty to low rates of domestic saving and capital accumulation, \nto low or negative rates of growth of productivity (Ben-David 1998). In an \nopen economy setting, with no restrictions on capital mobility, we should \nexpect to see, ceteris paribus, capital fl owing from rich to poor countries, \nattracted by higher potential returns, thereby accelerating capital accumu-\nlation. However, in reality, poor infrastructure, high rates of corruption, \nand political instability, by lowering the risk-adjusted rate of return to capi-\ntal, discourage such FDI fl ows, thereby explaining the \u201cLucas paradox\u201d \n(Lucas 1990).\nAnother potential poverty-trap mechanism arises from the ineffi cient \noperation of shallow fi nancial markets in poor countries. Because credit \nand insurance markets are plagued by informational imperfections, risk-\naverse lenders require collateral before they are willing to make loans. \nUnfortunately, the poor obviously lack assets that they can use as collateral \nand remain credit constrained. Costas Azariadis and Allan Drazen (1990) \nargue that credit rationing, because of a lack of \u201cfi nancial depth,\u201d reduces \ninvestment in human capital with important adverse consequences for \neconomic growth (De Soto 2000).\nSachs et al. (2004) argue that the solution to SSA\u2019s poverty trap lies in \nthe initiation of a temporary \u201cbig push\u201d on the investment front leading to \na \u201cstep\u201d increase in underlying productivity and a take-off into sustained \ngrowth. Given the nature and dynamics of the poverty trap, this big push \nrequires substantial external assistance in the form of a Marshall Plan for \nSSA. To support their case Sachs et al. use modifi ed versions of the Solow \nneoclassical growth model that include \u201ccritical thresholds . . . that must \nbe reached before the forces of standard competitive theory take hold\u201d \n(Bowles, Durlauf, and Hoff 2006).\nThe standard Solow growth model is built around the familiar neo-\nclassical aggregate production function (4) and focuses on the proximate \ncauses of growth:\nY = At F(K, L),  (4)\nwhere Y is real output, K is capital, L is the labour input, and At is a mea-\nsure of exogenously determined \u201ctechnology.\u201d The aggregate production \nfunction is assumed to be \u201cwell-behaved,\u201d that is, it satisfi es the follow-\ning three \u201cInada\u201d conditions (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2005). First, for \nThe Solow Model, Poverty Traps, and Foreign Aid 251\nall values of K > 0 and L > 0, F(\u2022) exhibits positive but diminishing mar-\nginal returns with respect to both capital and labor, that is, \u2202F\/\u2202K > 0, \n\u22022F\/\u2202K2 < 0, \u2202F\/\u2202L > 0, and \u22022F\/\u2202L2 < 0. Second, the production function \nexhibits constant returns to scale such that F (\u03bb K, \u03bbL) = \u03bbY, that is, rais-\ning inputs by \u03bb will also increase aggregate output by \u03bb. Letting \u03bb = 1\/L \nyields Y\/L = AtF (K,\/L,1\/L). This assumption allows (4) to be written \ndown in intensive form as (5) where y = output per worker (Y\/L) and k = \ncapital per worker (K\/L):\ny = At f(k), where f \u2032(k) > 0, and f \u2032\u2032(k) < 0 for all k. (5)\nEquation (5) states that, for a given technology (At), output per worker is \na positive function of the capital-labor ratio and exhibits diminishing \nreturns. Third, as the capital-labor ratio approaches infi nity (k \u2192 \u221e) the \nmarginal product of capital (MPK) approaches zero; as the capital-labor \nratio approaches zero, the marginal product of capital tends toward \ninfi nity (MPK \u2192 \u221e). The standard diagrammatic representation of the \nSolow model embraces the intensive form of the neoclassical aggregate \nproduction function that satisfi es the above conditions. In a recent com-\nment on these conditions, Sachs recalls that it took him twenty years to \nfully appreciate the implications of these mathematical properties of the \nneoclassical production function (Snowdon 2007).\nHow does capital accumulate? Where s = the domestic savings rate, n = \nthe rate of population growth, and \u03b4 = the rate of depreciation, and dk\/dt = \ncapital deepening, then the well-known fundamental differential equation \nof the Solow model is given by (6):\ndk\/dt = sAf(k)\u2014(n + \u03b4)k. (6)\nThe capital widening term (n + \u03b4)k indicates the investment (saving) per \nworker necessary to hold the capital-labor ratio constant. In the Solow \nmodel, as long as sAf(k) > (n + \u03b4)k, output per worker will grow. When \nsAf(k) = (n + \u03b4)k, an economy has reached a steady-state equilibrium.\nSachs et al. (2004) argue that the textbook neoclassical growth model \nis a \u201cspecial case\u201d and the actual behavior of an economy at very low lev-\nels of output per worker is very different from the one portrayed in the \nstandard neoclassical model in three important ways: \n 1.  While in the conventional Solow model the MPK is nearly infi nite \nat very low levels k, in reality, because production processes require \na \u201cminimum threshold of capital\u201d (kT), MPK is also low in poor \n252 Brian Snowdon\n2. Solow (1956, 71) notes that \u201cthe steady adjustment of capital and output to a state of \nbalanced growth comes about because of the way I have drawn the productivity curve.\u201d He \nalso considers the impact of a \u201cvariable saving rate\u201d (87\u201389) and \u201cvariable population growth\u201d \n(90\u201391).\n3. I am grateful to an anonymous referee who drew my attention to Buttrick\u2019s paper.\ncountries. Therefore, without the presence of basic infrastructure \n(roads, human capital, etc.) the productivity of small increments \nof k will be negligible. In fi gure 1, dk\/dt only becomes positive \nabove point kT, and at low levels of k there are increasing returns \nto capital accumulation due to a nonconvexity in the production \nfunction.\n 2.  As shown in fi gure 2, when k is very low, the savings rate is likely \nto be low, or even negative, because very poor people need to con-\nsume all of their income just to survive. However, saving increases \nwith higher levels on output (income) per worker (capita), form-\ning an \u201cS\u201d shaped function. With sAf(k) less steep than (n + \u03b4)k \nat low levels of k, then dk\/dt is again negative below point kT \n(Solow, 1956, also discusses alternative confi gurations of the sav-\nings function).\n 3.  A third factor likely to prevent capital accumulation at low levels of \nk is rapid population growth. There is a strong correlation between \nlow income per capita and fertility rates, and poor people, for per-\nfectly rational reasons, aim to have large numbers of children. Fig-\nure 3 illustrates a Solow model with a demographic trap. Note how \nthe (n + \u03b4)k function is very steep at low levels of k. Therefore dk\/dt \nis again negative below kT.\nWhile Sachs et al. argue that in very poor countries the \u201ccapital thresh-\nolds, savings traps, and demographic traps\u201d are all likely to interact to pro-\nduce a powerful \u201cpoverty trap,\u201d throughout their discussion they refer only \nto the \u201cstandard neoclassical model,\u201d never mentioning or citing Solow\u2019s \n1956 paper. In doing so they miss the opportunity to note that Solow also \nconsidered nonstandard outcomes.2 Indeed, as early as 1958, John But-\ntrick\u2019s Quarterly Journal of Economics paper demonstrated the relevance \nto development economics of the possibility of multiple equilibria in the \nSolow model.3\nWhile the infl uential arguments of Sachs have provided a rallying point \nfor the pro-aid lobby, many economists remain unconvinced that foreign \nThe Solow Model, Poverty Traps, and Foreign Aid 253\naid is either necessary or suffi cient for successful growth and develop-\nment. Aart Kraay and Claudio Raddatz (2007) fi nd little evidence support-\ning the existence of poverty traps, in their extensive survey of the litera-\nture. Azariadis and Jan Stachurski (2005) note that there are a large number \nof self-reinforcing mechanisms that can interact and potentially cause a \npoverty trap. In such cases, policy shocks will have \u201clarge and permanent \nFigure 1 The Solow model with a minimum capital stock threshold. \nAdapted and extended from Sachs et al. 2004.\n254 Brian Snowdon\neffects if one-off interventions can cause the formation of new and bet-\nter equilibria.\u201d However, they also recognize that engineering such an \noutcome to achieve a more effi cient equilibria in practice is very problem-\natic, given the perverse infl uence of the prevailing structure of incen-\ntives in many developing countries, together with problems of corruption \nand the lack of information facing policymakers.\nThere is considerable variation in the motivation and behavior of aid \ndonors, and the research of Alberto Alesina and David Dollar (2000) con-\nfi rms that the criteria for bilateral aid allocations are dominated as much \nFigure 2 The Solow model with a savings trap. Adapted and extended \nfrom Sachs et al. 2004.\nThe Solow Model, Poverty Traps, and Foreign Aid 255\nby political and strategic considerations as they are by considerations of \neconomic development. Alesina and Beatrice Weder (2002) demonstrate \nthat there is no evidence that less corrupt governments receive more \nforeign aid than highly corrupt governments, and Jacob Svennson (2000) \nalso provides evidence that infl ows of foreign aid are associated with \nincreased corruption and rent-seeking behavior, especially in countries \nwhere there are competing social groups.\nAccording to the critics of aid, \u201ccapital fundamentalism\u201d and the \n\u201caid-fi nanced investment fetish\u201d have led policymakers up the wrong \nFigure 3 The Solow model with a demographic trap. Adapted and \nextended from Sachs et al. 2004.\n256 Brian Snowdon\npath in their \u201celusive quest for growth.\u201d Indeed, Easterly (2006a, 2006b) \nargues that although the H-D model died long ago in academia, it is still \ninfl uential among economists working in the major international fi nan-\ncial institutions who continue to employ the H-D\u2013Chenery-Strout meth-\nodology to calculate the investment and aid requirements needed for \nspecifi c countries to achieve their growth targets. However, Easterly argues \nthat the evidence that aid fl ows into investment on a one-for-one basis, \nand that there is a fi xed linear relationship between growth and invest-\nment in the short run, is \u201csoundly rejected\u201d (see also Burnside and Dol-\nlar 2000; Easterly, Levine, and Roodman 2000; Rajan and Subrama-\nnian 2005).\nTo date, the \u201ctop down,\u201d \u201cmega reform,\u201d planned administrative approach \nto solving the problem of world poverty involving large increases in the \nfl ow of foreign aid has not been a success (Easterly 2006a). What is the \nalternative? Easterly advocates a piecemeal gradualist \u201cbottom up\u201d approach \nin the spirit of Edmund Burke and Karl Popper. However, Easterly does \nconcede that aid could be useful in achieving more modest objectives than \nRostovian \u201ctake-offs\u201d into \u201cself sustaining growth,\u201d if incentive structures \nat ground level were improved and if the existing bureaucratic fl aws within \nthe international aid agencies could be corrected.\nFrom Solow to the Fundamental \nDeterminants of Growth\nIn the most recent wave of growth theory and empirics, modern political \neconomy models have been used to investigate the deeper or fundamen-\ntal determinants of growth, something the Solow model does not and was \nnot designed to address. A major problem with formal growth models that \nfocus on the proximate determinants of growth is that they necessarily \nignore factors such as the infl uence of history, path dependency, ethno-\nlinguistic fractionalization, and the numerous political and economic bar-\nriers to reform. Fortunately, recent political economy models of growth \nfocus on factors such as the quality of governance, the origins of the legal \nsystem, ethnic diversity, social cohesion, democracy, trust, corruption, \npath dependency, political barriers, and institutions in general (Helpman \n2004; Acemoglu 2008). Consequently, some of the most exciting devel-\nopments in recent years have been those emerging as a result of the \nremarkable coming together of the fi elds of economic growth, economic \ndevelopment, and economic history. This has led to several insightful \nThe Solow Model, Poverty Traps, and Foreign Aid 257\npolitical economy contributions to our understanding of the deeper (fun-\ndamental) determinants of long-run economic growth and development. \nKey insights have emerged from the research of such scholars as Douglass \nNorth (2005), Dani Rodrik (2007), and Daron Acemoglu and James Rob-\ninson (2006).\nAlthough there is obviously a great deal of interaction among the \nnumerous factors infl uencing growth, perhaps the most promising frame-\nwork for analyzing SSA\u2019s growth tragedy is one that emphasizes the role \nof institutions and political constraints. Rodrik (2007) has emphasized \nthe importance of embedding a market economy within a set of non-\nmarket institutions and identifi es fi ve key institutions, namely, \u201cproperty \nrights; regulatory institutions; institutions for macroeconomic stabilisa-\ntion; institutions for social insurance; and institutions for confl ict man-\nagement.\u201d However, it is important to emphasize that these institutions \n\u201care not uniquely determined,\u201d and Rodrik rejects the discredited \u201cneo-\nliberal social-economic model\u201d associated with the more extreme versions \nof the Washington Consensus.\nWhile the World Bank (2002) is giving increasing emphasis to the \ngrowth-retarding impact of weak institutions, and many economists are \nnow persuaded that the incentive structure created by the institutional \nenvironment must be a key ingredient that determines the success or fail-\nure of countries in their \u201celusive quest for growth,\u201d there remains little \nconsensus on the precise channels of causation running from institutions \nto economic growth. As Elhanan Helpman (2004) observes, \u201cThe study of \ninstitutions and their relation to economic growth is an enormous task on \nwhich only limited progress has been made so far.\u201d\nTo understand the political roots of economic success remains a crucial \nresearch area for economists, and the recent work of Acemoglu and North, \nand their coresearchers, is making a substantial contribution in this area \n(Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; North et al. 2007). A major problem facing \nalmost all developing countries is how to make the formidably diffi cult \ntransition from their current politico-economic status as \u201climited access \norders\u201d to becoming \u201copen access orders\u201d (North et al. 2007). Limited \naccess orders are those where \u201csocial, economic, and political systems are \nbased on limited entry and rent creation,\u201d while open access orders are \ncharacterized by the rule of law and open competition in both the politi-\ncal and economic spheres. While there may be leeway for aid to perform \na role in the more \u201cmature\u201d limited-access societies, in fragile limited-\naccess orders aid infl ows could very well be highly destabilizing.\n258 Brian Snowdon\nConclusion\nFifty years on, the idea that many low-income countries in SSA are caught \nin a poverty trap is once more popular among economists who advocate \nsome form of global Marshall Plan to defeat poverty. Sachs et al. (2004) \nreject the orthodox Solow model as a useful framework of analysis for \npoor countries because its key assumptions rule out the possibility of a \npoverty trap. While the three poverty-trap mechanisms built into the \nSolow model and highlighted by Sachs have intellectual appeal and are \ntheoretically plausible, the lack of any systematic empirical evidence sup-\nporting them suggests that a very cautious response is appropriate to \nappeals for substantial increases in aid as a viable solution to SSA\u2019s pov-\nerty. There are numerous examples of countries (including the United \nKingdom and United States) that have escaped from poverty via sustained \ngrowth where foreign aid has played little or no part. Furthermore, large \ninfl ows of aid, of the volume envisaged by Sachs, are not a dominant fea-\nture of the thirteen countries that have sustained rapid growth during the \nlast forty years discussed in the 2008 Commission on Growth and Devel-\nopment Report (a commission, by the way, of which Bob Solow was a \nmember).\nThe most signifi cant barriers to economic progress in much of SSA \nhave their origin in the destructive dynamics of internal political confl ict \ncombined with dysfunctional institutions and misguided economic poli-\ncies, rather than minimum capital threshold, saving, and demographic pov-\nerty traps. Ineffi cient institutions, created and perpetuated by elites, are a \nmajor barrier to progress in many developing countries. As economists we \nshould not be surprised when aid fl owing into an environment dominated \nby mismanaged or corrupt institutions and inadequate governance fails to \ndeliver a virtuous circle of enlightened reforms and the Holy Grail of sus-\ntained economic growth. In reality, the economic history of the world has \nrepeatedly demonstrated how political barriers prevent economic progress. \nNowhere is this problem more acute than in SSA.\nReferences\nAcemoglu, Daron. 2008.
