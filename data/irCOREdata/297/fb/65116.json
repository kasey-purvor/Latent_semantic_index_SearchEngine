Jeffrey Anderson notes that \n\u2015politics is rooted in territory\u2026 [but] the spatial dimension of the political \neconomy is so prevalent that it is easily, if not frequently, overlooked\u2016 (1992: \nxiii). Bertrand Badie suggests that \u2015the principle of territoriality often eludes \ncritics because it seems so obviously universal. It is a decisive component in the \nactions of the state, but it is, nevertheless, linked to a historical development\u2016 \n(2000: 58). Claude Raffestin argues that \u2015the problem of territoriality is one of \nthe most neglected in geography\u2016, and that \u2015the history of this notion remains to \nbe done\u2016 (1980: 143).2 It is worth noting that Badie and Raffestin talk of \n\u2017territoriality\u2018 rather than \u2017territory\u2018; a point to which this paper will return. \n \nWhile there are some excellent and important investigations of particular \nterritorial configurations, disputes or issues (see, for example, Sahlins 1989; \nWinichakul 1994; Paasi 1996; J\u00f6nsson et. al. 2000), and some valuable \ntextbooks on the topic (Storey 2001; Delaney 2005), there is little that \ninvestigates the term \u2017territory\u2018 conceptually or historically.3 This is, in part, \nbecause territory is often assumed to be self-evident in meaning, allowing the \nstudy of its particular manifestations\u2014territorial disputes, the territory of specific \ncountries, etc.\u2014without theoretical reflection on \u2017territory\u2018 itself. Where it is \ndefined, territory is either assumed to be a relation that can be understood as an \noutcome of territoriality, or simply as a bounded space, in the way that Giddens \ndescribed the state as a \u2015bordered power container\u2016 (1981: 5-6, 11; see 1987).4 \nIn the first, the historical dimension is neglected, since it appears that territory \nexists in all times and places; in the second the conditions of possibility of such a \nconfiguration are assumed rather than examined. Both take the thing that needs \nexplaining as the explanation; the explanandum as the explanans. Rather, \nterritory requires the same kind of historical, philosophical analysis that has been \nundertaken by Edward Casey for another key geographical concept, that of place \n(1997).5  \n \nLinda Bishai suggests that territory \u2015may be examined in a similar fashion as \nsovereignty\u2014through conceptual history\u2016 (2004: 59). Yet conceptual history, \nBegriffsgeschichte, has, with partial exceptions, not been turned towards the \nquestion of territory explicitly. There is, for instance, no explicit discussion of \nterritory in the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe, the Handbuch politisch-sozialer \nGrundbegriffe in Frankreich, or the Historisches W\u00f6rterbuch der Philosophie, \nwhich are the most comprehensive works of the Begriffsgeschichte approach \n 2 \npioneered by Reinhart Koselleck (see Bruner et. al. 1972-97; Reichardt and \nSchmitt, 1985-; Ritter et. al. 1971-2007; Koselleck 2002, 2006). The work of the \nCambridge School of contextualist approaches to the history of political thought, \nof which Quentin Skinner and J.G.A. Pocock are perhaps the most significant \nfigures, offers substantive help in its methodological principles, but only \ntangentially in terms of its focus (Skinner 1978, 2002; Pocock 2009). Important \nthough such methods are, the approach employed here is closer to a \ngenealogical account, of the type Foucault developed from Nietzsche and \nHeidegger\u2018s work (see Elden 2001, 2003b). Genealogy, understood as a historical \ninterrogation of the conditions of possibility of things being as they are, is helpful \nfor a number of reasons. It makes use of the kinds of textual and contextual \naccounts offered by Begriffsgeschichte or the Cambridge school; but is critical of \nnotions that the production of meaning is reliant on authorial intent. It makes \nuse of the full range of techniques\u2014including etymology, semantics, philology \nand hermeneutics\u2014that should inform the history of ideas; but pairs them with \nan analysis of practices and the workings of power. And it is avowedly political; \nundertaking this work as part of a wider project that aspires to be a \u2017history of \nthe present\u2018.6 \n \nThe best general study of territory remains Jean Gottmann\u2018s The Significance of \nTerritory (1973; see Muscar\u00e0 2005). It trades on his earlier book La politique des \n\u00c9tats et leur g\u00e9ographie, where he claims that \u2015one cannot conceive a State, a \npolitical institution, without its spatial definition, its territory\u2016 (1951: 71). \nNonetheless, in both works he tends to use the term in an undifferentiated \nhistorical sense, as a concept used throughout history (see for example 1951: \n72-3). Thus while he makes a detailed and valuable analysis, he is still perhaps \ntoo willing to see territory existing at a variety of spatial scales and in a variety of \nhistorical periods. This tends to create an ahistorical, and, potentially, \nageographical analysis. One of the very few attempts that begins to offer a more \nproperly historical account of territory is found in the work of the legal theorist \nPaul Alli\u00e8s in his book L\u2018invention du territoire, which was originally a thesis \nsupervised by Nicos Poulantzas in 1977. Alli\u00e8s suggests that \u2015territory always \nseems linked to possible definitions of the state; it gives it a physical basis which \nseems to render it inevitable and eternal\u2016 (1980: 9). It is precisely in order to \ndisrupt that inevitability and eternal nature that an interrogation of the state of \nterritory is necessary. \n \nThis paper outlines some of the issues at stake in undertaking such a project. It \nproceeds through a number of stages. First, it asks why territory has been \nneglected as a topic of conceptual analysis, and critically interrogates work on \nterritoriality. Second, it suggests that often territory is effectively taken as \u2017land\u2018 \nor \u2017terrain\u2018; political-economic and political-strategic relations which are essential \nbut ultimately insufficient. Third, it argues that territory needs to be interrogated \nin relation to state and space; and that its political aspects need to be \n 3 \nunderstood in an expanded sense of political-legal and political-technical issues. \nFinally it proposes that territory can be understood as a political technology; \nwhich is not intended to be an absolute definition, but to raise the questions that \nneed to be asked to grasp how territory has been understood in different \nhistorical and geographical contexts. \n \nThe Neglect of Territory and the Problem with Territoriality \n \nWhy has territory been neglected? There are several reasons. First, the turn \naway from reflection on the state, especially by post-structuralist approaches, \nseems to have rendered suspect attention on these issues. As Joe Painter notes, \n\u2015conventional definitions of territory emphasize boundedness, identity, integrity, \nsovereignty and spatial coherence\u2014concepts that post-structuralism is often \nthought to have demolished\u2016 (2009: 3). Second, and not unrelated, the fear of \nwhat John Agnew identified as the \u2017territorial trap\u2018 (1994a; 2009). Agnew \nsuggests that this is a threefold assumption of the conventional understanding of \nthe geography of state power: that \u2015modern state sovereignty requires clearly \nbounded territories\u2016; that \u2015there is a fundamental opposition between \u2017domestic\u2018 \nand \u2017foreign\u2018 affairs in the modern world\u2016 and that \u2015the territorial state is seen as \nacting as the geographical \u2017container\u2018 of modern society\u2016 (1994a; see 2005: 41; \n1994b). As Agnew notes the first assumption dates from the 15th-20th century; \nand the second two from last 100 years, although there are of course earlier \nprecedents (2005: 41). Others have made similar claims. Gottmann, for instance, \nnotes that it is all too easy to assume uncritically the modern, or legal sense of \nterritory as a \u2015portion of geographical space under the jurisdiction of certain \npeople\u2016 (1973: 5). All-too-often though, interrogations have not led to a more \ncareful examination of what territory is, and its intrinsic limits, but rather to an \navoidance of the topic altogether. It is through a historical conceptual \nexamination that moving beyond \u2017the territorial trap\u2018, rather than simply skirting \naround it, is possible. Third, a degree of conceptual imprecision regarding the \nterms of territory and territoriality. The slippage between these two distinct \nterms was noted above in the quotes from Ruggie and Raffestin, but they are \nhardly alone. (I have lost count of the number of times that I have said that I am \nworking on territory only for the person to reply with a reference to, or \ndiscussion of, territoriality.) It is crucial to achieve clarity about the aim of the \ninvestigation.  \n \nWhat is the problem with territoriality? The first thing to note is that unlike, say, \n\u2017spatiality\u2018, which is generally understood as a property or condition of space, \nsomething pertaining to it; \u2017territoriality\u2018 has today a rather more active \nconnotation. The other, older sense of \u2017territoriality\u2018, as the condition, or status \nof territory, rather than a mode of operating toward that territory, is generally \nlost. It would be good to retrieve it. Second, territoriality in that more recent \nsense itself needs to be distinguished, as there are at least two conflicting \n 4 \ntraditions in the use of the term, the first biological; the second social. These \nmay not actually be distinct, and care should be taken to suggest an implied \nnature\/culture divide, but advocates of territoriality do present them in this way. \nThere is therefore a logic to approaching these works under their own \nterminological division. \n \nWriters such as Wagner (1960), Ardrey (1967) and Malmberg (1980) outlined \nways where territory can be understood through a basis in a fundamental \nbiological drive and as a form of animal association. Their work often covers a \ngreat deal of ground, within a broad historical sweep, but they continually blur \nterritory and territoriality together, seeing territoriality as a constant human \nelement, played out in different contexts. This is an important tradition of \nknowledge.7 Some geographers, particularly in the late 1960s and early 1970s, \nutilised these behaviourist assumptions in the linkage between human and \nanimal territoriality.8 Edward Soja, for instance, declared in 1971 that \n\u2015territoriality, as it is used here, is a behavioural phenomenon associated with \nthe organization of space into spheres of influence or clearly demarcated \nterritories which are made distinctive and considered at least partially exclusive \nby their occupants or definers\u2016 (1971: 19). The problem with this is that while it \ncan tell us something about human behaviour in space, it is not at all clear that it \ncan tell us something about \u2017territory\u2018. In part this is due to the obvious point \nthat human social organisation has changed more rapidly than biological drives. \nIndeed, Soja recognises precisely these issues (1971: 28), and as a later section \nof this paper will demonstrate, does offer a more useful approach to territory. \nIndeed as Soja notes almost two decades later, \u2015much of this work had to be \npurely defensive, for the then prevailing view of territoriality was filled with bio-\nethological imperatives which obscured any socio-political interpretation\u2016 (1989: \n150 n. 9). \n \nA rather different approach is offered by Robert Sack in Human Territoriality \n(1986; see 1983). Despite its title Sack does not suggest a purely biological, \ndeterminist approach. He suggests that territoriality is a geo-political strategy, \nand not a basic vital instinct. Sack claims that while he sees \u2015territoriality as a \nbasis of power, I do not see it as part of an instinct, nor do I see power as \nessentially aggressive\u2016 (1986: 1). Sack labels the area or place delimited and \ncontrolled through territoriality a territory, but the non-specific nature of his \nenquiry becomes clear here. A place can be a territory at times but not at others; \n\u2015territories require constant effort to establish and maintain\u2016; and as a corollary \nof the previous definition they are \u2015the results of strategies to affect, influence, \nand control people, phenomena, and relationships\u2016 (1986: 19). Indeed, in his \nlater Homo Geographicus, Sack conceives of the general \u2015role of place as \nterritory\u2016, suggesting that \u2015the meaning of place in this current book is then very \nmuch like that of territory\u2016 (1997: 272 n. 1).  \n  \n 5 \nSack effectively argues that territoriality is a social construct (not quite a \nproduct), forged through interaction and struggle, and thoroughly permeated \nwith social relations. There are some excellent chapters\u2014especially on the US \nrectangular land survey and the church (1986 chs. 4 and 5)\u2014but none of this \nreally gets to grips with the complexities in the term \u2017territory\u2018 itself. The problem \nwith this mode of analysis\u2014a problem it shares with the biological approach\u2014is \nthat it is both historically and geographically imprecise. These kinds of \nunderstandings seem to transcend historical periods and uneven geographical \ndevelopment, and also function beyond geographical scale (see also Dear and \nWolch 1989). Perhaps this is only to be expected given that the focus is on \n\u2017territoriality\u2018 instead of territory. Sack is at his best when he approaches the \nquestion of territoriality historically, such as in the passages on Renaissance \nthought (1986: 83), or on the role of capitalism in shaping understandings of \nspace and time (1986: 84-5).9 Yet, as Soja notes, \u2015neither my earlier work nor \nSack\u2018s however, provide a satisfactory social ontology of territoriality\u2016 (Soja \n1989: 150 n. 9). \n \nA related analysis to Sack can be found in some of the writings of the Swiss \ngeographer Claude Raffestin. Like Sack, Raffestin is cautious about assuming too \nstraight-forward a relation between animal and human territoriality (1988: 264). \nRather he develops a rich account grounded on a reading of Foucault and \nLefebvre together. While this has become more common in recent years, \nRaffestin was pioneering in reading them together in his 1980 book Pour une \ng\u00e9ographie du pouvoir. Raffestin develops Foucault\u2018s theory of power, \nsuggesting that \u2015relational space-time is organised by a combination of energy \nand information\u2016 (1980: 46; see 2007). In a sense, energy can be read alongside \npower; and information with knowledge, the other two terms of the Foucauldian \ntriad of space, knowledge and power. For Raffestin, \u2015population, territory and \nauthority\u2016 are the three elements of the state, and he suggests that \u2015the entire \ngeography of the state derives from this triad\u2016 (1980: 17; see Muir 1981). \n \nRaffestin contends that \u2017space\u2018 and \u2017territory\u2018 are not equivalent, and that using \nthem indiscriminately has led to a lot of confusion. Space is, for Raffestin, the \nanterior term, because territory is generated from space, through the actions of \nan actor, who \u2017territorialises\u2018 space (1980: 129). This is the potential danger, in \nthat while Raffestin wishes to make an argument for the conception precision of \nterritory, he invokes territoriality as the way into this term. The displacement of \nterritory by territoriality blunts the potential of his analysis. Yet at times he offers \nsome very valuable insights, particularly evident in his careful and historical \nexamination of the notion of the frontier (1986). A similar criticism could be \nlevelled against Rhys Jones, Peoples\/States\/Territories, who is similarly good on \nthe particular practices of state territorial formation, but tends to collapse \nterritory into territoriality, which loses the conceptual precision and analytic \npurchase of the former term (2007: especially 3, 34). \n 6 \n \nAn Approach to Territory \n \nIn identifying some of the reasons why territory has been neglected as a topic of \nexamination, Painter has suggested that \u2015\u2017territoriality\u2018 is often treated as \ncomplex and dynamic; \u2017territory\u2018 as more straightforward and not in need of \nsophisticated analysis\u2016 (2009: 6). While it is difficult to dispute the complexities \nsurrounding territoriality, its dynamism appears not to be historical. Indeed, \ngiven that territoriality is so widespread in animal and human behaviour, it can \nonly help us to understand territory if that is a term without a history. Rather it is \nterritory that is logically prior to territoriality, even if existentially second. \nStrategies and processes toward territory\u2014of which territoriality is but a \nfraction\u2014conceptually presuppose the object that they practically produce. It \nmay well therefore be more fruitful to approach territory as a concept in its own \nright.  \n \nWhile Soja was initially discussed alongside behaviourist accounts, as indicated \nthis does not do justice to the richness of his analysis. One of the things that is \nmost notable is his claim that while all societies have spatial dimensions, few \noperate in territorial ways, thus implying that territory is more historically and \ngeographically limited than is often assumed to be the case. He similarly notes \nthe tendency to assume that a Western model can be universalised to explain \nthe world more generally (1971: 16). He looks at a number of other societies, \nsuggesting that \u2015in nearly all of these societies there was a social definition of \nterritory rather than a territorial definition of society\u2016 (1971: 13, see 33). On this \nbasis, he comes to his general claim regarding \u2015the political organization of \nspace\u2016: \n \nIts major purpose is to create and maintain solidarity within the \nsociety by shaping the processes of competition, conflict, and \ncooperation as they operate spatially (1971: 7). \n \nTo understand these three processes of competition, conflict, and cooperation \nSoja proposes a tripartite analysis of resource, power and social organisation, \nwhich repays careful thought. \n \n1. \u2015control over the distribution, allocation, and ownership of scarce \nresources (including land, money and power\u2014the ability to make \nauthoritative decisions)\u2016 \n2. \u2015the maintenance of order and the enforcement of authority\u2016 \n3. \u2015the legitimization of authority through societal integration\u2016 (1971: 7). \n \nThe claim here is that for the analysis of territory this is more useful than his \ntrading on behavioural biological models; more helpful than Sack\u2018s social \n 7 \napproach through territoriality; and can be brought into fruitful combination with \nRaffestin. While Raffestin is too willing to approach territory through territoriality, \nand tends to see space as an ahistorical absolute, he is invaluable in thinking the \nway that territory needs to be understood through representation, appropriation \nand control, broadly understood as the workings of power. \n \nIn competition, conflict, and cooperation; and resource, power and social \norganisation Soja has identified two groups of three related terms. These terms \nbegin to allow us to think through three inherently related, yet ultimately distinct \nconcepts: land, terrain, territory. The suggestion being made is that land, terrain \nand territory need to be conceptually distinguished; even if in many instances \nthey are practically intertwined. \n \n- Land is a relation of property, a finite resource that is distributed, allocated \nand owned; a political-economic question. Land is a resource over which \nthere is competition. \n \n- Terrain is a relation of power, with a heritage in geology and the military; the \ncontrol of which allows the establishment and maintenance of order. As a \n\u2017field\u2018, a site of work or battle, it is a political-strategic question. \n \n- Territory is something that is both of these, and more than these. Territory \nmust be approached in itself rather than through territoriality; and in relation \nto land and terrain. \n \nEach can, of course, be read in what appears to be non-political ways: land as an \naesthetic category; terrain in a scientific register; territory as the mere outcome \nof territoriality. Yet each of these is shot through with relations of power. There \nis a political economy to the environment; a political-strategy to the impact of \ntechnology; and an understated politics to territoriality. \n \nLand \n \nSome accounts see territory as a form of property. The modern English word \nterritory\u2014a word shared by the Romance languages and found in many \nGermanic ones\u2014is traditionally derived from the Latin terra. This is a word \ntranslated as \u2017earth\u2018 or \u2017land\u2018. Part of the reason for this is its etymology: tir is the \ndry, terra is dry land. There is a similar reference in the word \u2017terrace\u2018, or \n\u2017terracotta\u2018, baked earth. In Old Irish tir is land or earth and ters is dry. In Latin \ntorrere is to dry, parch; in Greek tersesthai is to become dry; in Sanskrit trsyati is \nhe thirsts. While the term \u2017land\u2018 is found in Old English (sometimes spelt as \nlond), and has a distinct lineage, it is not surprising that a number of writers \nhave made the explicit link between land and territory. Those taking a \nperspective from territoriality often make that suggestion. Hoebel suggests that \n 8 \nland is the basis of human existence, \u2015the most important single object of \nproperty. All societies are territorially based, and most sustenance is drawn from \nthe soil, either directly or indirectly\u2016 (Hoebel 1949: 331; see Malmberg 1980: \n84). For Ardrey \u2015ownership of land is scarcely a human invention, as our \nterritorial propensity is something less than a human distinction\u2016 (1967: 4); \nwhereas Malmberg stresses how \u2015closely related behavioural territory and \nproperty in land really are\u2016 (1980: 87). \n \nHere though the interest is in those that take a political-economic approach to \nthe question of territory, stressing the linkage between territory and land; seeing \nterritory as a form of property. Soja makes this point clearly: \n \nConventional Western perspectives on spatial organisation are \npowerfully shaped by the concept of property, in which pieces of \nterritory are viewed as \u2017commodities\u2018 capable of being bought, sold, \nor exchanged at the market place (1971: 9).  \n \nUnsurprisingly, many of those offering such a view are often operating within a \nMarxist perspective. Whereas the question of land is sometimes underplayed in \naccounts of Marx, it is an important element of his analysis, trading on earlier \npolitical economists such as Ricardo. In Marx, Lefebvre insists, there is a notion \nof land alongside the labour and capital issues. Rather than look at capital-labour \nrelations then, there is a three way relation of \u2015land-capital-labour\u2016 (1974: 325; \n1991: 282). One of the final chapters of Volume III of Capital, entitled \u2015The \nTrinity Formula\u2016 relates the three terms to their economic aspect: \u2015Capital-\nprofit\u2026 land-ground-rent, labour-wages, this trinity form holds in itself all the \nmysteries of the social production process\u2016 (1981b: 955). But Marx\u2018s comments \nin this chapter\u2014compiled by Engels from three fragments\u2014are rather cursory. \nScattered discussions in other parts of this volume on rent and mines give some \nextra details.  \n \nIn The German Ideology, Marx and Engels recognise the geographical character \nof different systems of political rule (1970: 45). While feudalism operated with a \ncategory of land, it was capitalism and the emergence of the modern state that \ncemented the idea of land as a taxable asset. Equally the organic relation of \npeople to land is fractured. In Capital Volume I, Marx suggests that \u2015the \nexpropriation of the great mass of the people from the soil, from the means of \nsubsistence and from the instruments of labour, this terrible and arduously \naccomplished expropriation of the mass of the people forms the pre-history of \ncapital\u2016 (1981a: 928, see 876). There were a range of political-economic \nchanges in the transition from the Medieval to the Early Modern world that \nimpacted on land, including industrialisation, the concentration of people in \ntowns and cities, the emergence of the middle classes, the shift to national \n 9 \nrather than local markets, and a gradual concentration of jurisdiction with the \ncentralisation of state power. \n \nIt is clear that Marx intended this treatment to be much more extensive\u2014indeed \nin his projected plan, after Capital the next volume was to be On Landed \nProperty before a volume on labour, and ones on the state, international trade \nand the world market (1983: 270, 298; see 1975: 424). Yet apart from the \nworkshop of the Grundrisse little of this is extant (1973: 275-9, 485-8; for a \nfruitful development see Harvey 1982). One of the comments in the Grundrisse is \nrevealing. Marx claims that \u2015the relation to the earth as property is always \nmediated through occupation of the land and soil, peacefully or violently\u2016 (1973: \n485). Lefebvre similarly suggests that \u2017land\u2018\u2014la terre\u2014must be understood in this \npotentially broad sense: \n \nLa terre? This is not solely agriculture, but also the subsoil and its \nresources. It is also the nation-state linked to a territory. And hence \nalso absolute politics and political strategy (1974: 374-5; 1991, \n325).  \n \nPerry Anderson\u2018s Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism and Lineages of the \nAbsolutist State provide a large-scale analysis of state development from within \nthis broad perspective, concentrating on the material forces and economic \nconditions for different political formations (1974a; 1974b). This is not \neconomically reductive, for while he sees land as crucial, his determination of \npolitical space is not wholly economically determined. In Lineages, for example, \nhe looks at conflict within feudalism. Unsurprisingly this was often conflict over \nland: \n \nThe typical medium of inter-feudal rivalry, by contrast, was military \nand its structure was always potentially the zero-sum conflict of the \nbattlefield, by which fixed quantities of ground were won or lost. \nFor land is a natural monopoly: it cannot be indefinitely extended, \nonly redivided. The categorical object of noble rule was territory, \nregardless of the community inhabiting it. Land as such, not \nlanguage, defined the natural perimeters of its power (1974b: 31). \n \nIn some respects this is unremarkable, but a number of important issues are \nindicated here. Possession of land is the determinant of power, and conflict over \nland a key indicator of power struggles. Land though is not something that can \nbe created, but is a scarce resource, one whose distribution and redistribution is \nan important economic and political concern.  \n \nThinking territory as land, as property, thus gives a political-economic relation. \nThis is an essential part of any analysis of territory. Yet just as Lefebvre \n 10 \nrecognises that analysis of social space must go beyond property relations of \n\u2015earth and land\u2016, to look at the productive process that imposes \u2015a form on that \nearth or land\u2016, this requires an emphasis that goes beyond the economic (1974: \n102; 1991: 85).  \n \nTerrain \n \nThe conflict over land indicated by Anderson is significant. Property is important \nas an indicator, but conflict over land is twofold: both over its possession and \nconducted on its terrain. Land is both the site and stake of struggle. In this it \ndiffers from conflict over other resources. Strategic-military reasons thus \nbecome significant. As well as seeking to maximise the possession of land as a \nscarce resource, feudal lords and nascent states were also concerned with \nsecurity, management and administration. Defensible borders, homogeneity and \nthe promotion of territorial cohesion offer a range of examples\u2014examples that \nstraddle the strategic issues and link closely to the development of a range of \ntechniques of state practice. France, for example, following the Treaty of the \nPyrenees in 1659, began a process of mapping and surveying its land, \nemploying technical specialists both to map and reinforce its so-called \u2017natural \nfrontiers\u2018.  \n \nA related term to that of land is therefore \u2017terrain\u2018. This is land that has a \nstrategic, political, military sense. The English \u2017territory\u2018, the French territoire \nand related terms in other languages derive from quite a specific sense of the \nLatin territorium. Territorium is an extremely rare term in classical Latin that \nbecomes common in the Middle Ages. The standard definition is the land \nbelonging to a town or another entity such as a religious order. It is used, for \ninstance by Cicero for the agricultural lands of a colony (1858: Vol IV, 522) and \nin phrases such as that describing the birthplace of the Venerable Bede in his \nEcclesiastical History. Bede is described as being born \u2015in territorio eiusdem \nmonasterii\u2016, \u2015in lands belonging to the monastery\u2016 (1969: V, 24). This \nmonastery was Jarrow in northeast England. In Alfred the Great\u2018s Anglo-Saxon \ntranslation, Bede was born \u2015on sundorlonde of the monastery\u2016, outlying lands, \nlands sundered from the estate itself, but under its possession, and thus it has \nbeen claimed that this is basis for the name of the town Sunderland, although it \nis not clear this it was this sundorlonde (Brown 1855: 277, 280; Colgrove 1969: \nxix).  \n \nAs a number of writers have discussed, the etymology of territorium is disputed, \nwith the meaning of the place around a town supplemented by that of a place \nfrom which people are warned or frightened (see, for example, Connolly 1995; \nNeocleous 2003; Hindess 2006). The Latin terrere is to frighten, deriving from \nthe Greek trein meaning to flee from fear, to be afraid, and the Sanskrit, trasati: \nhe trembles, is afraid. This means that the term territory has an association with \n 11 \nfear and violence, an association that is more compelling in history than \netymology. As argued elsewhere, \u2015creating a bounded space is already a violent \nact of exclusion and inclusion; maintaining it as such requires constant vigilance \nand the mobilisation of threat; and challenging it necessarily entails a \ntransgression\u2016 (Elden 2009: xxx). \n \nTerrain is of course a term used by physical geographers and geologists. Yet all \ntoo often the term terrain is used in a very vague sense. Evans, for instance, \nnotes that \u2015to some of us, \u2017terrain analysis\u2018 means, especially, quantitative \nanalysis of terrain\u2016, thus seeing a greater need to qualify the mode, rather than \nobject, of analysis (1998: 119). Terrain is seen as land form, rather than process \n(Lane et. al. 1998; see Wilson and Gallant 2000; Lawrence et. al. 1993). It is also \na term used by military strategists. Yet there is a relation as well as a separation, \nwith knowledge of battlefield terrain essential to military success. There are a \nnumber of important studies of different military campaigns and the question of \nterrain, but little conceptual precision (see, for example, Parry 1984; Winters \n1998; Rose and Nathanail 2000; Doyle and Bennett eds. 2002).10 For Doyle and \nBennett, terrain \u2015encompasses both the physical aspects of earth\u2018s surface, as \nwell as the human interaction with them\u2016 (2002: 1). At times terrain seems to be \nlandscape devoid of life, as it is when targeting of cities is discussed without \nreference to those living within it, or it is reduced from a concrete materiality to a \nlevel of virtuality. \n \nMax Weber\u2018s analysis of the historical development of the state, and Michael \nMann\u2018s study of the changing dynamics of power (1986; 1993), where they do \ndiscuss territory, could be seen to be operating in a way that sees territory as \nterrain, a political-strategic relation. In his interview with the geographers of the \nH\u00e9rodote journal, Foucault deflects their inquiry about his use of spatial \ncategories, suggesting that they are not primarily geographical, but instead shot \nthrough with power. As he declares, \u2015territory is no doubt a geographical notion, \nbut it\u2018s first of all a juridico-political one: the area controlled by a certain kind of \npower\u2016 (2007: 176). As his interviewers respond, \u2015certain spatial metaphors are \nequally geographical and strategic, which is only natural since geography grew \nup in the shadow of the military\u2016 (2007: 177). They make the explicit linkage \nbetween the region of geographers and the commanded region, from regere; the \nconquered territory of a province, from vincere; and the field as battlefield. \nFoucault then notes how \u2015the politico-strategic term is an indication of how the \nmilitary and administration actually come to inscribe themselves both on a \nmaterial soil and within forms of discourse\u2016 (2007: 177).  \n \nLefebvre offers further concrete and compelling discussion of this relation:  \n \nSovereignty implies \u2017space\u2018, and what is more it implies a space \nagainst which violence, whether latent or overt, is directed \u2013 a \n 12 \nspace established and constituted by violence\u2026 Every state is born \nof violence, and state power endures only by virtue of violence \ndirected towards a space\u2026 At the same time, too, violence \nenthroned a specific rationality, that of accumulation, that of the \nbureaucracy and the army \u2013 a unitary, logistical, operational and \nquantifying rationality which would make economic growth possible \nand draw strength from that growth for its own expansion to a \npoint where it would take possession of the entire planet. A \nfounding violence, and continuous creation by violence (by fire and \nblood, in Bismarck\u2018s phrase) \u2013 such are the hallmarks of the state \n(1974: 322-3; 1991: 280; see 133\/122; 2009; see Brenner and \nElden 2009).  \n \nWhat is central in Lefebvre\u2018s reading is the relation between accumulation, \nviolence and the \u2015unitary, logistical, operational and quantifying rationality\u2016. For \nLefebvre this highlights the limitations of a political-economic reading of territory \nas land: \n \nNeither Marx and Engels nor Hegel clearly perceived the violence at \nthe core of the accumulation process\u2026 and thus its role in the \nproduction of a politico-economic space. This space was of course \nthe birthplace and cradle of the modern state (1974: 322; 1991: \n279; see 413\/358). \n \nIn a related analysis Achille Mbembe has looked at the kinds of violence upon \nwhich colonial sovereignty was founded. The first of this was founding violence, \nwhich \u2015underpinned not only the right of conquest but all the prerogatives \nflowing from that right\u2026 it helped to create the space over which it was \nexercised\u2016. The second and third kinds of violence concern legitimation and \nauthority, and in particular the \u2015maintenance, spread, and permanence\u2016 of \nauthority (2001: 25). But it is the first that is central here: the creation of the \nspace through violence over which violence is then exercised. Heidegger\u2018s \ndiscussion of the transition from the Greek polis to the Latin imperium similarly \nlinks these two senses\u2014land and terrain:  \n \nFor the Romans, on the contrary, the earth, tellus, terra is the dry, \nthe land as distinct from the sea; this differentiates that upon \nwhich construction, settlement, and installation are possible from \nthose places where they are impossible. Terra becomes territorium, \nland of settlement as realm of command [das Sieglungsgebiet als \nBefehlsbereich]. In the Roman terra can be heard an imperial \naccount, completely foreign to the Greek gaia and g\u0113 (1982: 88-89; \n1992: 60). \n \n 13 \nIt is important to note that the German term Gebiet\u2014with its sense of region\u2014\nhas a rather different set of associations than the Latin territorium. Gebiet is the \nterm used in Weber\u2018s famous description of the state. It bears relation to the \nnotion of a Fl\u00e4chenstaat or a \u2017territorial state\u2018, with Gebiet as a region over which \nviolence reigned: a Bereich-Gewalt, a field of violence. It is in this context that \nHeidegger\u2018s description of a \u2015land of settlement as a realm of command\u2016 bridges \nthe land-terrain understandings. \n \nLand and terrain are obviously important notions, and many theorists combine \nelements of both approaches. It is therefore clear that the political-economic \nand political-strategic understandings have considerable merit, and that \nespecially their historical interrogation offers much towards a critical analysis. \nYet, like the approach through territoriality, they tend to fail the historically \nspecific test. As a political-economic relation the importance of property in land \nis clear from as far back as there is recorded human history. From Plato\u2018s Laws \nor Kleisthenes\u2018s urban reforms of Athens (Elden 2003a), to its importance in \nWilliam the Conqueror\u2018s Domesday Book of 1086, property in land clearly \npredates the specificity of state territory.11 Land as a commodity to be bought \nand sold was an important element of the construction of the United States of \nAmerica with the Louisiana purchase and the sale of Alaska by Russia. A similar \nargument can be made concerning terrain, with a strategic importance that also \nextends throughout human history. From Thucydides\u2018 History of the \nPeloponnesian War through Julius Caesar\u2018s accounts of The Gallic War or The \nCivil War, land as terrain is of serious military significance. Equally when \nMachiavelli talks of territory in The Prince this too is closer to a sense of terrain. \nThe translation of the Classical Greek khora or the Latin terra, agrum or finibus \nas \u2017territory\u2018 masks these distinctions. \n \nTerritory \n \nThe point being made here is to underline that \u2017territory\u2018 is certainly something \nthat is closely related to \u2017land\u2018 or \u2017terrain\u2018 but is more than them. \u2017Territory\u2018 \nneeds to be thought in its specificity. This approach being outlined thus differs \nfrom the account offered by Saskia Sassen in her recent book Territory, \nAuthority, Rights: From Medieval to Global Assemblages, which examines what \nshe calls medieval, modern and global state assemblages through an \ninterrogation of the interrelation of three key terms\u2014\u2017territory\u2018, \u2017authority\u2018 and \n\u2017rights\u2018, conjoined as \u2017TAR\u2018 (2006). Sassen suggests that the particular ways that \nthey work in combination help us to understand the political configurations that \narise at a particular point in time. In this sense \u2017territory\u2018 is assumed as a static, \nahistorical concept in order to illuminate another problematic (see, for example, \n2006: 18). Indeed, Sassen says that \u2017territory\u2018, \u2017authority\u2018 and \u2017rights\u2018 are her \n\u2015building blocks\u2016 and are \u2015navigators inside the two black boxes that are the \nnational and the global. Each evinces the analytic capability for dissecting these \n 14 \ntwo master categories\u2016 (2006: 6). One particularly telling remark is when she \nsuggests that \u2015my concern is not historical evolution but developing an analytics \nof change using history\u2016 (2006: 27). While this can yield some potential insights, \nit does so at great violence to the history of thought. \n \nIn distinction, a more fruitful way forward is to analyse how territory is \ndependent on a number of techniques and on the law. In doing so this approach \nexceeds merely conceptual history, but begins to fold the analysis of practices \ninto its genealogical account. The legal aspects of the relation between \nsovereignty, jurisdiction and authority with territory has been relatively well \nexamined\u2014the historical emergence of these terms less so\u2014but in terms of \ntechniques these include advances in geometry, such as the coordinate or \nanalytic geometry pioneered by Ren\u00e9 Descartes (a form of geometry that uses \nalgebra, coordinates and equations). There are also a series of related \ndevelopments in cartography and land surveying, particularly including the use \nof the cross-staff and quadrant to find latitude; new tools and techniques of \nmeasurement; the rediscovery of Ptolemy\u2018s Geography; and changes in \nmaritime navigation particularly through more accurate measurement of time \nand therefore longitude.12  \n \nThe mapping and control of territory is, in large part, dependent on such \ntechniques. Only with these kinds of abilities could modern boundaries be \nestablished as more than a simple line staked out on the ground. For \nmountainous regions, for deserts or tundra, or particularly for the abstract \ndivision of unknown places in the colonised world, such techniques were crucial. \nThey are made possible through a calculative grasp of the material world, what \nLefebvre calls abstract space but which actually characterises the emergence of \na category of space in Western thought more generally. Spatium in classical \nLatin did not mean \u2017space\u2018, but rather an extent; similarly the Greeks had no \nword for space. One of Lefebvre\u2018s comments is relevant here: \u2015as a product of \nviolence and war, [abstract space] is political; instituted by a state, it is \ninstitutional\u2016 (1974: 325; 1991, 285). As a range of thinkers have noted, in this \nsense cartography does not just represent the territory, but is actively complicit \nin its production. It is no surprise that the key sponsors of advances in \ncartographic techniques were states (Corner 1999: 222; Pickles 2004: 31; King \n1996: 16-17; Jacob 2006; Strandsbjerg 2008). In the quotation cited earlier, \nwhere Soja suggests that Western territory is related to property, he continues: \n \nSpace is viewed as being subdivided into components whose \nboundaries are \u2017objectively\u2018 determined through the mathematical \nand astronomically based techniques of surveying and cartography \n(1971: 9; see Paasi 1996: 19).  \n  \n 15 \nThen, drawing on the anthropologist Paul Bohannan, he notes that \u2015we are the \nonly people in the world who use seafaring instruments to determine our position \non the ground\u2016 (Bohanan 1966: 165). These \u2017seafaring instruments\u2018 have of \ncourse developed greatly even in the years since this observation, but the basic \ndetermination remains. How does the quantification of space and the role of \ncalculative mechanisms enable the commanding of territory and the \nestablishment of borders?13 \n \nThere is, at least, a twofold relation between the strategic and the technical. On \nthe one hand, for instance, the work undertaken by Vauban for the French crown \nwas dependent on a range of newly discovered techniques; as was the surveying \nwork of the Cassini family (Godlewska 1999; Mattelart 1999). As von Clausewitz \nrecognised, such techniques were essential to modern military operations: \n\u2015Bonaparte rightly said in this connection that many of the decisions faced by the \ncommander-in-chief resemble mathematical problems worthy of the gifts of a \nNewton or an Euler\u2016 (1976: 112; see Alli\u00e8s 1980: 57; Lacoste 1976: 16). On the \nother, there is an inherent violence to these techniques. In the famous title of \nLacoste\u2018s 1976 book, \u2015geography is, above all, making war\u2016 (see 1976: 7). At the \nsame time as these calculative techniques, there are political-juridical \ndevelopments in legal codes; in the understanding of the sovereignty-territory \nrelation and the distinction between sovereignty and majesty, all of which \ndetermine the question of political rule over space. \n \nFoucault\u2018s Security, Territory, Population lectures are invaluable here, because \nalthough Foucault moves away from a focus on territory, the shift he is \nconcerned with demonstrates the development of a range of techniques that \nwould indeed be brought to bear on territory as an object of governance, \nalongside that of population (2004). Foucault claims that there is a shift between \nterritory as the focus of governance and the government of things, essentially \npeople as a population. In distinction to his historical argument, but using his \nconceptual tools, Foucault is most valuable in seeing the parallel shift from \npeople to population and from land\/terrain to territory. Territory is no longer \nmerely the economic object of land; nor a static terrain; but territory is a vibrant \nentity, \u2015within its frontiers, with its specific qualities\u2016 (2004: 99-100). The \nstrategies applied to territory\u2014in terms of its mapping, ordering, measuring, and \ndemarcation, and the way it is normalised, circulation allowed, and internally \nregulated\u2014are calculative. Territory is more than merely land, and goes beyond \nterrain, but is a rendering of the emergent concept of \u2017space\u2018 as a political \ncategory: owned, distributed, mapped, calculated, bordered, and controlled \n(Elden 2007).14  \n \n 16 \nConclusion: Territory as a Political Technology \n \nIt would be unusual or reductive to see the political-economic, political-strategic, \npolitical-legal or political-technical in strict isolation. Political-economic accounts \noften indicate a strategic relation; strategic work recognises the importance of \nlaw and the dependence on measure and calculation. Yet it is only in seeing \nthese elements together, and in privileging the legal and the technical, that an \nunderstanding of the complexities of territory can be attained. To concentrate on \nthe political-economic risks reducing territory to land; to emphasise the political-\nstrategic blurs it with a sense of terrain. Recognising both, and seeing the \ndevelopment made possible by emergent political techniques allows us to \nunderstand territory as a distinctive mode of social\/spatial organisation, one \nwhich is historically and geographically limited and dependent, rather than a \nbiological drive or social need. Indeed, recognising and interrogating this does \nnot just allow us to see that the modern division and ordering of the world is \npeculiar and clearly not the only possible way, but it also allows us to begin to \nescape what Agnew described as \u2017the territorial trap\u2018. As Agnew himself notes, \nsocial science has often been too geographical and insufficiently historical (1995: \n379). It is through a historical conceptual examination that moving beyond \u2017the \nterritorial trap\u2018 rather than simply avoiding it might be possible (Brenner and \nElden 2009; for a related inquiry see Murphy 1996).  \n \nThe overall suggestion here is thus that territory is not best understood through \nterritoriality, but through an examination of the relation of the state to the \nemergence of a category of \u2017space\u2018. Edward Casey describes his book The Fate of \nPlace as an inquiry which \u2015traces out the idea of place vis-\u00e0-vis space\u2016 (2002: \nxvii). What understanding of space was necessary for the idea of territory to be \npossible? If territory is seen as a \u2017bounded space\u2018 or as Giddens\u2018s \u2017bounded \npower container\u2018, the question that remains is what is this space and how are \nthese boundaries possible? As Paul Alli\u00e8s suggests, \u2015to define territory, we are \ntold, one delimits borders [fronti\u00e8res]. Or to think the border, must we not \nalready have an idea of homogeneous territory?\u2016 (1980: 32). To put this more \nforcefully, boundaries only become possible in their modern sense through a \nnotion of space; rather than the other way round. Focusing on the determination \nof space that makes boundaries possible, and in particular the role of calculation,  \nopens up the idea of seeing boundaries not as a primary distinction that \nseparates territory from other ways of understanding political control of land; but \nas a second-order problem founded upon a particular sense of calculation and \nconcomitant grasp of space. How does that concept of space become a political-\nlegal category and what kinds of techniques are at work? \n \nTwo qualifications to this analysis are necessary. The first is that this is an \napproach derived from, and directed toward, Western political thought. The \nproblematic term \u2017West\u2018 is of course open to question, but it is intended here to \n 17 \nbe read in relation to a chronology of thought that can be traced from Ancient \nGreece, to Roman appropriations and late medieval Latin rediscoveries, providing \nthe conceptual frame within which the emergence of the modern state and its \nterritory occurred.15 Other traditions would have very different histories, \ngeographies and conceptual lineages. The specificity of the analysis begun here \nmilitates against generalisation and pretensions to universalism. Nonetheless, it \nis hoped that this historical conceptual approach would be useful in other such \nanalyses, even if it would need to be supplemented, developed, and critiqued. \nThe second qualification is that while this work seeks to utilise an expanded \nunderstanding of territory that goes beyond narrowly economic or strategic \naccounts, but which is also attentive to the specificity of the notion, its approach \nis necessarily partial. As Val\u00e9rie November notes, \u2015the notion of territory is at the \nsame time juridical, political, economic, social and cultural, and even affective\u2016 \n(2002: 17). Here, the social, cultural, and affective elements have been \nunderplayed in order to emphasise the political in a broad sense. This is not to \nsuggest that those other elements are unimportant, but rather that they have \nbeen discussed elsewhere in some detail. The literature on the nation, on \nattachment to homeland, and identity politics, for instance, can profitably be \nread from a territorial perspective (see Winichakul 1994; Paasi 1996; Yiftachel \n2006). Folding the insights of those analyses into the outline offered here would \nbe a necessary step for any account which aimed to be comprehensive. \n \nThree interlinked propositions thus provide an agenda for future work; a project \nwhich seeks to grasp the history of the state of territory: \n \n1. Territory must be approached as a topic in itself; rather than through \nterritoriality. Indeed, it may well be the case that the notion of \u2017territoriality\u2018 \nwith regard to humans can only be appropriately understood through a notion \nof territory. In other words, while particular strategies or practices produce \nterritory, there is a need to understand territory to grasp what territoriality, as \na condition of territory, is concerned with. \n2. Territory can be understood as a \u2017bounded space\u2018 only if \u2017boundaries\u2018 and \n\u2017space\u2018 are taken as terms worthy of investigation in their own right as a \npreliminary step. These terms require conceptual and historical work \nthemselves; rather than being sufficient for an explanation. \n3. \u2017Land\u2018 and \u2017terrain\u2018\u2014as political-economic and political-strategic relations\u2014are \nnecessary but insufficient to grasp \u2017territory\u2018.  \n \nTerritory can be understood as a political technology: it comprises techniques for \nmeasuring land and controlling terrain. Measure and control\u2014the technical and \nthe legal\u2014need to be thought alongside land and terrain. Understanding territory \nas a political technology is not to define territory once and for all; rather it is to \nindicate the issues at stake in grasping how it was understood in different \nhistorical and geographical contexts. Territory is a historical question: produced, \n 18 \nmutable and fluid. It is geographical, not simply because it is one of the ways of \nordering the world, but also because it is profoundly uneven in its development. \nIt is a word, concept and a practice; where the relation between these can only \nbe grasped genealogically. It is a political question, but in a broad sense: \neconomic, strategic, legal, and technical. Territory must be approached politically \nin its historical, geographical and conceptual specificity. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis paper was initially given as a keynote lecture to a joint session of the \nFinnish Political Association and Finnish Sociological Associations conferences, at \nthe University of Lapland, Rovaniemi, Finland.

However it applies liberal \njustice theory to a relatively unproblematic notion of territory, rather than \nproviding a properly political theory of territory.  \n2  Similar claims are made, among others, by Gottman 1973: ix; Ruggie, \n1993: 174; Kratochwil 1986: 27-8; and most recently by Antonisch 2009. \n3  This is despite periodic attempts to reassert the importance of the concept \nof territory to political geography. See, for example, Cox 1991, 2003; \nDriver 1991; Johnston 2001. More detailed work has generally come from \nthose outside the discipline. See, for example, Mann 1986, 1993; Spruyt \n1994; Teschke 2003. \n 26 \n \n4  One of the most productive developments of this in geography has been \nTaylor 1994; 1995. For a recent account, see Paasi 2009. \n5  This is not to suggest, of course, that territory is the privileged object of \nsocial\/spatial theory, but rather that compared to other dimensions (see \nJessop et. al 2008; Macleod and Jones 2007) it has been underexamined. \nThere is simply no study of territory comparable to Casey\u2018s for place; it is \nconceptually much less examined than network; and with the exceptional \nof some initial skirmishes (i.e. Cox 1991; Steinberg 1994) there has been \nno \u2017territory debate\u2018. Other terms, such as landscape, have received much \nmore careful historical analysis (see Cosgrove 1998; Olwig 2002). \n6  An attempt to show how an understanding of territory can illuminate \ncontemporary events is made in Elden 2009. \n7  Key works in animal behaviour that influenced this work include Hachet-\nSouplet 1912; Howard 1948; and Hediger 1955. \n8  From within political science Grosby (1995) has attempted to reassert this \nnotion. \n9  A related criticism might be offered of his Conceptions of Space in Social \nThought (1980), which offers a conceptual but largely ahistorical account \nof different understandings of space, particularly in relation to the divide \nand relation between the human and physical sciences. For discussions \nwhich use Sack to think the more specific territory of the state see \nJohnston 1995, 2001; and within political science Vollard 2009. \n10  A broader sense of the military impact on space and environment is found \nin Woodward 2004. \n11  Though see Anderson 1996: 17, where he suggests that the record-\nkeeping exercise of the Domesday book, and one a century later in France \n\u2015was the basis of a new conception of territory in Western Europe, which \ngradually spread to central and eastern Europe\u2016. \n12  This argument is made at greater length in Elden 2005. For a range of \nuseful accounts see Dock\u00e9s 1969; Swetz 1987; Hadden 1994; and \nLinklater 2003. \n13  The philosophical aspects of this model of calculation were discussed in \nElden 2001 and 2006; and the relation between the state and space was a \nkey theme in Elden 2004, especially Chapters 5 and 6. \n14  Related analyses of calculation deriving from Foucault can also be found in \nRose-Redwood 2006; Hannah 2009; Steinberg 2009; Crampton, \nforthcoming. \n15  For an initial survey, see Elden 2010. \n"}
