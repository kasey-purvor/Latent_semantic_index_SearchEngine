INTRODUCTION\nExotic nuclei with extreme ratios of neutron and proton\nnumbers usually have very short lifetimes. Thanks to the\nadvance of radioactive nuclear beam (RNB) techniques, more\nand more exotic nuclei far from the valley of \u03b2 stability\nare being probed. However, there are still predicted to exist\nmany as-yet unobserved nuclei, where weak binding may\nlead to new physics with important impact on astrophysical\nnucleosynthesis processes [1]. Access to and beyond the\nproton drip line is achieved usually through fusion-evaporation\nreactions. By comparison, neutron-drip-line nuclei are more\ndifficult to reach, and new techniques are required.\nFor exotic nuclei, isomeric states, by virtue of their long\nlifetimes, can play an important role in their experimental\ninvestigation (see, e.g., Refs. [2,3]). Indeed, it has been\npointed out that the stability of superheavy nuclei can be\nincreased due to high-spin isomerism [4]. The influence of\nhigh-spin isomers on even-even drip-line nuclei has also been\nseen, for example, in the proton-drip-line nucleus 140Dy with\nan 8\u2212 isomer observed [5,6]. In even-even nuclei, multi-\nquasiparticle excitations involve breaking one or more pairs\nof nucleons, which results in significant excitation energies. In\nprinciple, the stability of a state decreases with increasing\nexcitation energy. However, the situation is different in\nodd-odd nuclei in which the ground state corresponds to\na two-quasiparticle (2qp) configuration. As a consequence,\nlong-lived isomers can frequently be found in odd-odd nuclei.\nIndeed, high-spin isomers with remarkably long lifetimes have\nbeen observed in a variety of exotic odd-odd nuclei [7].\nIn deformed nuclei, the angular-momentum projections\n(onto the symmetry axis) of the odd proton (\u0002p) and the\nodd neutron (\u0002n) couple to a total spin projection, K , with\na well-established Gallagher-Moszkowski (GM) [8] splitting\n*frxu@pku.edu.cn\nof the doublet states with K = |\u0002p + \u0002n| and |\u0002p \u2212 \u0002n| in\nodd-odd nuclei [9]. For the present purposes, the situation\nwhen both the odd neutron and the odd proton occupy high-\u0002\norbitals is particularly interesting, because it leads to high-spin\nand low-spin states at similar energies. Since electromagnetic\ntransitions from high-spin to low-spin states are strongly\nhindered, low-lying high-spin states in exotic nuclei can be\nforced to decay through \u03b2 radioactivity. High-spin states\nin nuclei at and beyond the proton drip line can decay\nby direct proton emission. The large spin change can also\nhave significant influence on the \u03b2 and proton decay rates,\nwhich will be discussed later. In the present work, systematic\ncalculations are used to identify candidates for long-lived\nisomers close to the proton drip line.\nII. THE MODEL\nConfiguration-constrained potential-energy-surface (PES)\ncalculations [10] have been performed to determine the\ndeformations and excitation energies of quasiparticle states.\nSingle-particle levels are obtained from the nonaxial deformed\nWoods-Saxon potential with the set of universal parameters\n[11]. In the pairing treatment, particle-number projection is\napproximated by the Lipkin-Nogami method [12]. In the\nconfiguration-constrained PES calculation, it is required to\nadiabatically block the unpaired nucleon orbitals that specify a\ngiven configuration. This has been achieved by calculating and\nidentifying the average Nilsson quantum numbers for every\norbital involved in the configuration [10]. The total energy of\na state consists of a macroscopic part that is obtained with\nthe standard liquid-drop model [13] and a microscopic part\nthat is calculated by the Strutinsky shell-correction approach,\nincluding blocking effects. The PES is calculated in the space\nof quadrupole (\u03b22, \u03b3 ) and hexadecapole (\u03b24) deformations.\nThe configuration-constrained PES calculation can properly\ntreat the shape polarization due to unpaired nucleons.\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(3)\/034313(6) 034313-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nLIU, XU, XU, WYSS, AND WALKER PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 034313 (2007)\nThe pairing strength (G) is first determined by the average\ngap method [14] and then adjusted to reproduce the experi-\nmental odd-even mass difference using a five-point formula in\nboth experiment and theory as discussed in Ref. [15]. Such an\nadjustment of the pairing strength is required so as to include\nthe shape and blocking effects on the mass difference [15].\nThe adjustment does not affect much the excitation energies\nof 2qp states in odd-odd nuclei, because excited 2qp states\nand the ground state have the same seniority (i.e., the same\nnumber of unpaired nucleons). However, the modification of\nthe pairing strength is important for the calculation of the\n\u03b2-decay energy, because an odd-odd nucleus is transformed\nby \u03b2 decay into an even-even nucleus (seniority zero) in which\nthe pairing correlation is stronger. The small adjustments of\npairing strengths can result in considerable changes of pairing\nenergies in even-even nuclei [10,15]. It will be seen that\nmodified pairing strengths can reproduce well experimental\n\u03b2-decay energies.\nIII. CALCULATIONS\nConfiguration-constrained PES calculations can predict\nwell the properties of quasiparticle states in deformed nuclei,\nincluding deformations, energies, and configurations [4,10].\nWe surveyed systematically the possible isomeric states in\nodd-odd deformed nuclei at the proton-rich limit of current\nexperimental knowledge. Figure 1 shows our predictions for\nlow-lying 2qp high-spin states in deformed odd-odd nuclei.\nThese high-spin states are formed by the spin coupling of the\nodd neutron and the odd proton. Due to no extra pair breaking\ncompared to ground states, the high-spin 2qp states can\nhave very low excitation energies, sometimes even becoming\nground states. Figure 1 shows that predicted high-spin 2qp\nstates mainly locate in the A \u223c 70, 130, 190, and transuranium\nregions. Later, we will discuss in more detail the A \u223c 130\nnuclei where more experimental observations are available.\nIn the mass 70 region, calculated ground-state PESs show\nprolate-oblate shape coexistence. Particularly for those nuclei\nnear the center of the region (i.e., both N and Z are around 35)\noblate minima lie lower than prolate minima. Our calculations\ngive \u03b22 \u2248 \u22120.3 oblate states in the A \u223c 70 nuclei. At such an\noblate deformation, the Fermi surfaces of the A \u223c 70 nuclei\nlocate around the high-\u0002 single-particle orbitals of the g9\/2\nsubshell. Indeed, a 9+ isomer in 70Br has been observed with\nthe configuration of \u03c09\/2+[404] \u2297 \u03bd9\/2+[404] [16]. Despite\nbeing at a high excitation energy of 2.23 MeV [17], the isomer\nhas a half-life of 2.2 s [16], much longer than the 79 ms of\nthe 0+ ground state. The present calculation shows that the\n9+ isomer has a \u03b22 = \u22120.28 oblate shape and an excitation\nenergy of 2.56 MeV, in good agreement with the measured\nenergy. The experiment [16] observed that the 9+ isomer has\ndirect \u03b2+\/EC decay into the 8+ or 9+ state of the daughter\nnucleus 70Se. For the isomer, the \u03b3 decay is highly hindered\nbecause of the high multipolarities needed for decay into the\nlower-energy, low-spin states. It is worth noting that the isomer\nhas a \u03b2-decay energy lower than that of the ground state [17].\nThis is because a high-spin 2qp state of an odd-odd nucleus\ndecays into a high-spin state of the even-even daughter, due\nto the spin selection in \u03b2 decay. The lower \u03b2-decay energy\nleads to a longer \u03b2-decay lifetime. For \u03b2+ decay, the lifetime\nis inversely proportional to the fifth power of the decay energy\naccording to the Sargent rule [18].\nLong-lived high-spin 2qp isomers appear also in A \u223c 130\nodd-odd nuclei. In Table I, we list our calculations of low-lying\n2qp states in odd-odd Cs and La isotopes. In the Cs isotopes,\nlong-lived high-spin isomers have been observed [7]. For\nthe La isotopes, we give predictions of possible low-lying,\nhigh-spin isomers. In these odd-odd isotopes, calculations\nshow that there are several low-lying, low-spin states with\nexcitation energies less than 100 keV (see Table I). In these\ncases, it is difficult to judge which configurations are ground\nstates, because we should not expect that the model is able to\ngive energies with accuracy better than several tens of keV. In\nthe A \u223c 130 mass region, high-spin states are formed because\nof the occupation of the proton 9\/2+[404] orbital. In 116Cs,\nfor example, the observed isomer has a half-life of 3.9 s,\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150\n K=3,4,5   (  Unknown nuclei   )\n K=6,7,8   (  Unknown nuclei   )\n K>8         (  Unknown nuclei   )\n Nearly spherical or triaxial nuclei\n                         (  Unknown nuclei   )\nPR\nO\nTO\nNS\n NEUTRONS\nFIG. 1.

Our calculation suggests the J\u03c0 =\n6+, \u03c09\/2+[404] \u2297 \u03bd3\/2+[411] configuration for the isomer.\nSimilar to the 9+ isomer in 70Br, the 6+ isomer in 116Cs was\nfound to \u03b2+\/EC decay with decay energy lower than that\nof the low-spin ground state [20]. As mentioned above, the\nlower \u03b2-decay energy contributes to the longer lifetime. The\n\u03b22 deformation of the isomer is calculated to be 0.28, which\nis larger than the 0.24 of the ground state and the 0.22 of the\ndaughter nucleus 116Xe. The shape polarization is due to the\noccupation of the proton 9\/2+[404] orbital. This polarization\nalso happens for other Cs and La isomers.\nCalculated results for N = 67, 69 isotones are listed in\nTable II. In 122Cs, our calculation gives the configuration\n\u03c03\/2+[422] \u2297 \u03bd1\/2+[411] for the ground state. This is\nconsistent with the experimental assignment [26]. As pointed\nout in Ref. [26], the configuration coupling in the 1+ state\nviolates the GM rule. In Table II, the states with the J\u03c0 =\n8\u2212 (\u03c09\/2+[404] \u2297 \u03bd7\/2\u2212[523]) configuration are particularly\ninteresting because of the very high spin value. In 122Cs, the\n8\u2212 isomer has been observed [7] with a half-life of 3.7 m,\nwhich is much longer than the 21 s of the 1+ ground\nstate [7]. The calculation gives \u03b22 = 0.27 for the observed\n8\u2212 isomer and reproduces well the experimental \u03b22 difference\n(\u0006\u03b22 \u2248 0.03) between the 8\u2212 isomer and 1+ ground state [27].\nFrom our calculations, J\u03c0 = 8\u2212 states appear also in 124La\nand 126La, with properties similar to those of the 8\u2212 isomer in\n122Cs. Indeed, a long-lived isomer with a possible experimental\nassignment of 7\u2212 or 8\u2212 was observed in 124La [7]. In 126La,\nexperiments have not seen the 8\u2212 isomer, but did observe\nlow-lying isomers with possible spins \u00015 [23]. In Pr and\nPm isotopes, experiments have seen the high-spin isomeric\nstates [7,25] without the low-spin states being observed. In\n128Pr, the calculation gives a 5+ configuration for the ground\nstate (see Table II), which disagrees with the newly assigned\n3+ configuration [24], but agrees with the earlier experimental\nassignment [25]. In 130Pm, a recent experiment [28] observed a\nsignal for the existence of a low-spin isomer. Unfortunately, the\ninformation is not enough to deduce a clear result. It is possible\nthat the high-spin isomers in Pr and Pm isotopes were observed\nprior to the low-spin states because of the enhanced stability\ncaused by high-spin isomerism. The high-spin isomers in\nTable II are formed because of the occupation of the neutron\n7\/2\u2212[523] orbital, while low-spin states appear with the\noccupation of the neutron 1\/2+[411] orbital.\nAs mentioned above, the \u03b2-decay energy is a sensitive\nprobe of the adjustment of the pairing strength.

We have calculated such\nenergies with adjusted pairing strengths, reproducing well the\nexperimental data [19] (see Tables I and II).\nThe properties of drip-line nuclei at shell closures are\nextremely interesting. Across the doubly magic nucleus,\n100Sn, in Fig. 1, calculations show that there are low-lying\nprolate 9+ 2qp states with the configuration of \u03c09\/2+[404] \u2297\n\u03bd9\/2+[404] in odd-odd 110,112I and 112,114Cs. Around the\nnext proton closed shell of Z = 82, there exist many low-\nlying high-spin 2qp states in A \u223c 190 odd-odd nuclei. It is\ninteresting that the high-spin states in the same nucleus can\nhave very different shapes: prolate and oblate. Their details\nare predicted in Table III. In 194,196,198Bi, 198,200,202At, and\n202,204,206Fr, an experiment [29] reported possible 10\u2212 and 7+\nisomers with the assigned configurations of \u03c0h9\/2 \u2297 \u03bdi13\/2\nand \u03c0h9\/2 \u2297 \u03bdf5\/2, respectively. In the present configuration-\nconstrained calculations, only the deformed high-spin states\ncan be treated. In 192At, a 9\u2212 or 10\u2212 isomer was observed with\nan oblate shape suggested [30]. However, our calculations give\noblate 10+ and prolate 10\u2212 states (see Table III).\nIn the transuranium region, the proton drip line is far from\nbeing reached experimentally. As shown in Fig. 1, high-spin\nisomeric states can occur in proton-rich transuranium nuclei.\nThe nuclei are calculated to have rather rigid prolate shapes\nwith \u03b22 \u2248 0.23. Recently, a T1\/2 = 3.6 m, 5\u2212 state (considered\nto be the ground state) and a T1\/2 = 2.9 m, 1\u2212 isomer were ob-\nserved in 236Am [31]. These two states were suggested to be the\nGM doublet of the configuration \u03c05\/2\u2212[523] \u2297 \u03bd5\/2+[633]\nthat results in the 5\u2212 and 1\u2212 (K\u03c0 = 0\u2212) states [31]. Our\ncalculations indicate that the \u03c05\/2+[642] \u2297 \u03bd5\/2+[633] and\n\u03c05\/2\u2212[523] \u2297 \u03bd5\/2+[633] couplings form the two lowest\nconfigurations in 236Am.\nIn the most proton-rich nuclei, an unbound proton can\nbe emitted directly from ground or isomeric states. In the\nhigh-spin 2qp states of odd-odd nuclei, however, there would\nbe an additional spin inhibition (e.g., centrifugal barrier and\ninteraction between the odd nucleons) leading to longer\nlifetimes. In Ref. [32], it has been pointed out that different K\nvalues in the wave functions of the mother and the daughter\ncan result in an additional K hindrance of the proton decay.\nThese would provide the possibility to extend the nuclide\nterritory further beyond the proton-drip line. For example,\na low-spin ground state might decay too fast (\u223c10 ns, say)\nfor experimental observation, while a high-spin isomer in the\nsame nuclide could be much longer lived. Such a scenario\nhas already been suggested to occur in 159Re and some other\nodd-Z nuclides [33], presenting a remarkable nuclear-structure\nsituation.\n034313-4\nHIGH-SPIN ISOMERIC STRUCTURES IN EXOTIC ODD- . . .

SUMMARY\nUsing configuration-constrained PES calculations, we have\ninvestigated low-lying 2qp states in deformed odd-odd, proton-\nrich nuclei at the limit of experimental accessibility. The mass\n70, 130, 190, and transuranium regions are favored for forming\nlow-lying high-spin isomeric states. The present calculations\nare helpful in understanding the structures of observed isomers.\nIn odd-odd nuclei, the energy differences between low-lying\n2qp states can be very small, e.g., less than 100 keV. It\nis difficult for model calculations to reproduce such small\ndifferences, and hence the level ordering can be uncertain.\nBecause of the strong spin inhibition in \u03b3 -ray transitions, some\nhigh-spin isomers can directly undergo \u03b2+\/EC decay into their\n034313-5\nLIU, XU, XU, WYSS, AND WALKER PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 034313 (2007)\ncorresponding even-even daughter nucleus. Also, because of\nspin selection in \u03b2 decay, a high-spin isomer can only decay\ninto high-spin excited states of the even-even daughter, which\nresults in a \u03b2-decay energy smaller than that for a low-spin\nstate. Therefore, high-spin isomers can have longer overall\nlifetimes than low-spin ground states. Beyond the proton drip\nline, a similar situation can apply to proton decay. Possible\nhigh-spin isomers are predicted, which should be useful for\nthe ongoing experimental endeavor to explore the limits of\nnuclear existence.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the Chinese Major State Basic\nResearch Development Program under Grant 2007CB815000;\nthe Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants\n10525520, 10475002, and 10375078; the Key Grant Project\n(Grant 305001) of the Education Ministry of China; the\nEPSRC (UK) and AWE plc; and the Swedish Science Research\nCouncil (V.R.).
