These results are important for large-scale applications of gold nitride in coatings and\nelectronics. \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics. fDOI: 10.1063\/1.1941471g\nMetal nitrides often possess unique properties suitable\nfor a number of applications, such as high hardness, high\nmelting points, chemical stability, and useful magnetic and\nelectrical properties. Gold films for use in the electronics\nindustry1,2 are deposited by electroplating and incorporate\nminute amounts of metallic and nonmetallic inclusions\nwhich can significantly affect bulk and surface properties.3\nMetals such as As, Pb, or Tl are typically added to increase\nthe hardness of gold coatings3 and there is a need to produce\nharder but still conductive gold coatings which reduce wear\nof the gold without the pollution associated with conven-\ntional additives. Although attempts to form gold nitrides\nhave been recorded for the past 20 years, this compound was\nproduced only recently, by \u0160iller and co-workers4,5 by irra-\ndiating a single crystal Aus110d surface with low energy ni-\ntrogen ions in an ultra high vacuum sUHVd environment.\nAlthough these studies demonstrated the existence of a pre-\nviously unobserved compound, it is not possible to measure\nmany of the physical properties relevant to potential applica-\ntions for films produced in this manner.\nHere we present a scalable plasma-based process for the\nproduction of large area gold nitride films and the physical\ncharacterization of those films. The production of materials\nby plasma methods and\/or ion bombardment is a delicate\nbalance between implanting the ions in the surface and their\nremoval by sputtering. Thus, low energy plasma conditions\nare essential for gold nitride to be formed.6 Gold nitride films\n,2 mm thick were deposited by reactive nitrogen ion sput-\ntering directly on a standard 100 mm Si wafer for conduc-\ntivity measurements, using an Edwards AUTO500 Magne-\ntron sputtering system typically operating at 300 W power\nand with a bias voltage of 490 V. The pressure of nitrogen in\nthe sputtering system was held at ,5310\u22123 mbar, yielding a\ndeposition rate of ,0.2 nm\/s.6 The thickness of the films\nwas measured by ellipsiometry. For hardness measurements,\na ,200 nm thick layer of Ti was predeposited on the silicon\nsurface by argon ion sputtering in order to improve adhesion\nof the gold nitride films to the substrate. Gold nitride was\nsubsequently deposited to a thickness ,1.5 mm under the\nconditions described above. For comparison, pure gold\nfilms of the same thickness were deposited with argon ion\nsputtering.\nWe also investigated the physical properties of gold ni-\ntride films produced by exposing a pure gold surface to a\nnitrogen plasma. In this method, a gold film ,1 mm thick\nwas deposited on a standard 100 mm Si wafer. The gold film\nwas then transferred to a plasma etching system sSTS, BOC\nEdwards sputter systemd. A surface gold nitride was then\nformed by exposing the gold film to a 13.56 MHz radio-\nfrequency plasma for about 30 min. The power employed to\ngenerate the plasma was 300 W and the target biased to\n\u2212240 V.6 During this process, the nitrogen pressure in the\nplasma chamber was 6.4 mTorr, and the flow rate of N2 was\n50 cubic centimeters per second ssccmd.6 The plasma etching\nmethod produces nitride layers only ,30\u201350 nm thick, in-\nsufficient for hardness measurements. With reactive ion sput-\ntering one can produce films of any thickness, hence this\nadElectronic mail: Lidija.Siller@ncl.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

In Fig. 1sad,\nwe present an XPS spectrum of a gold nitride film produced\nby reactive ion sputtering and, in Fig. 1sbd, by the plasma\netching-based process. For comparison, a spectrum from\ngold nitride produced by ion irradiation of Aus110d4 is shown\nin Fig. 1scd. Two distinct chemical states of nitrogen are\nobserved in the N1s spectra shown. Peaks A1 and A2 are\nattributed to the formation of two gold nitride phases,5 while\npeak B is associated with nitrogen molecules trapped in\nbubbles beneath the surface.4,5 It can be seen that the signal\nfrom the nitrogen trapped subsurface speak Bd is smallest for\nthe sample produced by reactive ion sputtering, possibly be-\ncause bubble formation is less efficient under reactive ion\nsputtering due to higher erosion rates. The shape and binding\nenergy positions of all peaks are almost identical leading to\nthe conclusion that the larger scale process produces material\nof the same composition as observed previously for single\ncrystal surfaces in UHV. Peaks A1 and A2 appear better re-\nsolved in Fig. 1sad than in Fig. 1sbd, which may be due to\nimproved homogeneity and order in the former. The nature\nof the nitride phases formed during ion implantation was\npreviously studied by ab initio theory.5 Calculations pre-\ndicted a triclinic Au3N crystal structure which could be me-\ntallic. This phase is about 2.25 eV higher in energy than\nmetallic gold and molecular nitrogen, and is thus\nmetastable5\u2014the reason why gold nitride has not been found\nin nature.\nThe percentage of gold nitride in the gold films investi-\ngated in this work sassuming the proposed stoichiometry of\nAu3N\n5d is ,10.5%, and was determined from the ratio of\nAu4f to N1s photoemission peaks, corrected for photoion-\nization cross section,7 transmission of the ESCA 300\nanalyzer,8 and electron escape depth. Here we present mea-\nsurements of electrical conductivity and hardness of such\ngold nitride thin films prepared by nitrogen ion reactive sput-\ntering and compare them with conductivity and hardness of\npure gold films of the same thickness prepared by sputter\ndeposition using an argon plasma. Mechanical measurements\nwere made with a Hysitron Triboindenter fitted with a sharp\ndiamond tip of cube corner geometry s,40 nm tip end ra-\ndiusd, carefully calibrated using a fused silica standard by the\nmethod of Oliver and Pharr.9 Twenty five indentations were\nmade on each sample in a five by five array with a separation\nof five microns between each indent. Tests were performed at\npeak loads from 100 to 2500 mN under load control. Hard-\nness and contact modulus Er were initially determined from\nthe load displacement curves produced using the methods of\nOliver and Pharr.9 The contact modulus is given by\n1\nEr\n=\n1 \u2212 n1\n2\nE1\n+\n1 \u2212 n2\n2\nE2\n, s1d\nwhere E and n are the Young\u2019s modulus and Poisson\u2019s ratio\nand the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to indenter and sample, re-\nspectively. Although the elastic constants of the diamond in-\ndenter are well known it is not possible to determine the\nYoung\u2019s modulus of an unknown sample exactly unless the\nPoisson\u2019s ratio is known. For this reason the coatings tested\nin this study are characterized in terms of the contact modu-\nlus alone.\nThe Oliver and Pharr approach gives unreasonable re-\nsults for these properties in gold due to the effects of pileup\naround the indentation.10 To correct for this, the indent area\nTABLE I.

This is similar to\nobservations for other soft materials such as aluminium.11\nThe uncorrected hardness of the gold is lower than that of the\nAuN whereas its uncorrected contact modulus is higher\nfFigs. 2sad and 2sbdg. In Fig. 2sbd it appears that the modulus\nincreases with indentation depth, this is because as the load\nincreases the amount of pileup increases and hence the size\nof the correction to the hardness or modulus due to pileup\nincreases safter correction, the modulii are constant with\ndepth within experimental errord. Annealing of the gold ni-\ntride has little or no effect on mechanical properties.\nConsiderable pileup of the films is visible in the AFM\nimages of the indents fFig. 2scdg with the amount of pileup\nreduced for the AuN coating. The average hardness and con-\ntact modulus of the films before and after correction are\nshown in Table I. Within experimental error the contact\nmodulus of gold and gold nitride is the same but the hardness\nof the gold nitride is about 50% higher. In comparison with\ngold electroplate and bulk gold the values for both hardness\nand contact modulus are higher. In both cases this is prob-\nably due to the small grain size of the coatings. For large\ngrained material where the indent samples a single grain the\nmeasured contact modulus is usually close to the Hill or\nVoigt average for single crystal properties fTable II, with\nsingle crystal parameters c11=190 GPa, c12=161 GPa and\nc44=42.3 GPa sRef. 12dg as is observed for the bulk and\nelectroplated gold coatings here. The hardness of the coating\nis critically dependent on its grain size, increasing as the\ngrain size is reduced down to a certain limiting size, the\nso-called Hall\u2013Petch behavior.13 AFM measurements of the\nsurfaces of the films tested in this study indicate that the\ngrain size of the electroplated and bulk gold is much larger\nthan the indentation size sTable IIId but that the plasma de-\nposited films have a much smaller grain size and the inden-\ntation will sample several grains. The hardness of the gold\nscales as the reciprocal of the square root of the grain size as\nmight be expected for Hall\u2013Petch behavior. In such circum-\nstances film texture and the presence of grain boundaries can\nalso have an effect on the measured contact modulus, par-\nticularly since elastic averaging methods are not reliable\nwhen only applied to material in a small number of grains.\nIn Fig. 3 we plot conductivity measurements made over\na temperature range of 77 to 298 K for a 2.12 mm thick gold\nfilm with a ,10.5% gold nitride content, produced via reac-\ntive ion sputtering. The conductivity of the film was mea-\nsured in the van der Pauw geometry.14,15 thus eliminating any\ncontact resistance. For comparison we plot the resistivity of a\npure gold film ,1.96 mm thick, over the same temperature\nrange. In this way we find that the resistivity of the gold\nnitride film is 11.9\u00b710\u22128 V m at room temperature. Gold\nhas a bulk resistivity 2.2\u00b710\u22128 V m sRef. 16d at room tem-\nperature and this suggests that the film is still a metallic\nconductor.\nThe above results are significant because they demon-\nstrate that gold films with incorporated gold nitride are\nharder than pure gold, but remain metallic, and confirm that\ngold nitride may be produced in large area films under con-\nditions which may be readily scaled, an important factor for\nany large scale application.1,2 Further studies are needed to\noptimize growth and increase the content of nitride in the\nfilm and consequently further increase the hardness.\nThis work was supported by EPSRC sGrant No. GR\/\nA92200\/01d.\n1During 2000 it was estimated that around 280 tonnes of gold, worth $8\nbillion, found its way into electronics and electrical components, while in\n2003 the same gold consumption has increased to ,400 tonnes, C.
