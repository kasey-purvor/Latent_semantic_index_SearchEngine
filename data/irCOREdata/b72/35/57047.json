Introduction \n \nImplicit in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD: 2000\/60\/EC) is the desire for \nhealthy river ecosystems and an avoidance of eutrophication. One of the manifestations \nof eutrophic conditions is phytoplankton blooms. Dense phytoplankton blooms may \ncause deterioration in ecosystem services, for example obstructing water abstractions \nfor drinking and industrial purposes (Henderson et al., 2008) impairs the provision of \nwater of a sufficient quality. Phytoplankton also include the toxic cyanobacteria group \nwhose occurrence in UK rivers is extensive (Ferguson, 1997). The specific effects of \nphytoplankton on dissolved oxygen (DO) (Cox, 2003) can have wider impacts on \nriver ecosystems; fish stocks being endangered by (i) diurnal DO sags associated with \nnight-time respiration and (ii) chronic DO suppression due to increases in river \nbiochemical oxygen demand (BOD) following population crashes. Hilton et al. (2006) \nhave described eutrophication as having several stages culminating with the \n2 \n \noutcompetition of macrophytes, depending on river retention time, by either \nphytoplankton or periphyton. An underlying, and serious, additional concern is the \nlikely impact of a future changing climate which may favour phytoplankton blooms \nand reduce DO levels (van Vliet and Zwolsman, 2008; Cox and Whitehead, 2009; \nJohnson et al., 2009; Whitehead et al., 2009).   \n \nIt has been widely assumed, within the scientific community and elsewhere, that \neutrophication in surface freshwaters is induced by enrichment of nutrients (nitrogen, \nphosphorus) which can be controlled by reducing pollution from diffuse \n(predominantly agricultural) and point (urban wastewater and industrial) sources. \nNutrient pollution and eutrophication is currently a key focus for policy decision-\nmaking, although such decisions also need to consider other motivations for curtailing \nnutrient inputs to rivers (e.g. drinking water quality: EC Nitrates Directive). Measures \nfor reducing nutrient pollution and their cost-effectiveness have been extensively \nexplored (e.g. Pretty et al., 2003; Cherry et al., 2008). Whilst models have \nsuccessfully described the effect of increases in nutrient levels on specific groups of \nphytoplankton in lakes (Reynolds et al., 2001); for river systems the relationship is \nless clear. Hydrological response and the complexity of river ecology, coupled with \nthe influence of geology, water temperature and riparian shading implies that \nsignificant variation in threshold nutrient levels between different rivers will occur. \nFor example, high flows are likely to suppress levels by flushing phytoplankton \ndownstream into estuaries (Neal et al., 2006). Thus in terms of nutrients, the critical \nthreshold concentrations for transition between ecological states cannot be fixed. \nHowever, values for phosphorus have been proposed for legislative purposes \n(UKTAG, 2008), albeit linked to ecological indicators not of total river phytoplankton \nbiomass but rather to the more-specific trophic diatom index (TDI), a measure of \nbenthic algal community composition (Kelly, 1998). Many other biological criteria of \nriver health focus on macro-invertebrates and these, along with TDI, are indices \nrequiring specific taxonomic skills that are not generally available. Furthermore, they \ncannot be measured frequently for site monitoring, are not useful for understanding \nshort-term changes, and are difficult to relate to specific drivers or pressures.  \n \nConcentration of chlorophyll-a pigment is a surrogate for total water column \nphytoplankton (sestonic algae) biomass; and threshold levels have been proposed for \nrivers. For example, a robust scheme based on monitoring of an extensive range of \ntemperate North American and European streams was formulated by Dodds et al. \n(1998) with a view to representing quantitatively the filamentous green algal group, \nexcluded from the TDI, which is readily associated with nuisance conditions. In \ncontrast to the taxonomic indices, chlorophyll-a measurements are readily made as \npart of UK national water quality monitoring schemes and have been related to \nnutrient concentrations and other environmental variables on a regional basis (Neal et \nal., 2006). Furthermore, including chlorophyll-a in dynamic process-based river \nhydrochemical models allows phytoplankton growth to be explored mechanistically.  \n \nMany river quality models include phytoplankton (e.g. Whitehead et al., 1997; \nReichert et al., 2001; Scharfe et al., 2009) and, due largely to a paucity of \nobservations, typically represent them as an assemblage. If supported by monitoring \ndata however, information from controlled experiments (Bowie et al., 1985) offers \nscope to improve model performance by discriminating between the behaviourally \nwell-defined functional groups and their environmental requirements (light, heat, \n3 \n \nnutrients). Diatoms, dominant in spring, often become growth limited by a third \nnutrient, silicon, and are succeeded by chlorophyceae (which include the \ncyanobacteria) during the summer (Garnier et al., 1995). However, in the summer \nwhen hotter, sunnier conditions are intuitively most favourable for blooms, sustained \nlow chlorophyll-a concentrations have often been observed (Skidmore et al., 1998; \nBalbi, 2000) and attributed for example to enhanced grazing by zooplankton \n(Gosselain et al., 1998). Phytoplankton have fairly well defined optimum light \nintensities for growth (Bowie et al., 1985), which can be self-regulated to a greater or \nlesser extent depending on the species through their buoyancy, an essential \nconsideration when modelling lake phytoplankton (Reynolds et al., 2001). Yet, for \nriver models it is debatable how best to embody vertical light attenuation and whether \nrepresenting stratification at low flows is warranted. In summary, a myriad of \nenvironmental, biological and physical factors can potentially enhance or curtail \nphytoplankton growth.  \n \nIn using the QUESTOR model (Boorman, 2003a, b), which represents explicitly the \nflows and chemical inputs from all tributaries and point sources to a network of river \nchannels, the present research seeks to identify to what extent river phytoplankton \ngrowth is limited by nutrients. In this way, understanding how riverine nutrient and \nchlorophyll-a concentrations relate in the context of other environmental variables \n(flow rate, light\/shading, temperature) will be tested. To assist this exercise, in \nkeeping with existing concepts of classification (Dodds et al., 1998; Gordon et al., \n2004; Hilton et al., 2006), a scheme using average spring-summer conditions as a \nmeans of differentiating four key progressive stages of eutrophication will be applied \nto enable prediction of trophic state in successive reaches along a river network. Many \nof the c. 300 rivers used by Dodds et al. (1998) to formulate classification were of \nsimilar size to that typical of larger UK rivers. This exercise will focus on the \nYorkshire Ouse network in north-east England (Figure 1), draining an area of 3530 \nkm\n2\n at the tidal limit 7 km south of York at Naburn Weir (NGR 4593 2446). \nParticular emphasis will be made on the Swale and Ure tributaries, the main \ncharacteristics of which are listed (Table 1).  \n \nUpstream of the more urbanised lower reaches (near York and Harrogate) the Ouse \ncatchment is largely rural and includes the Swale, Ure and Nidd tributaries, showing a \nclimatic range, a wide diversity of agricultural and other land-uses, and varied urban \ncoverage. In particular, the Swale sub-catchment has a greater incidence of point \nsources associated with urban centres. The Ouse has been the subject of large research \nmonitoring programmes (e.g. LOIS: (Leeks and Jarvie, 1998) and considerable \nmodelling effort (e.g. Silgram et al., 2009). Model applications have included studies \nspecifically simulating chemical status for EU legislative purposes (UKTAG, 2008). \nAccording to Boorman (2003c), using Environment Agency (EA) data, during 1996-\n2004, \u201cgood\u201d chemical status was achieved throughout the Ouse for DO (10th \npercentile > 60% saturation), BOD (90\nth\n percentile < 5 mg\/L) and ammonium (90\nth\n \npercentile < 0.6 mg N\/L), although for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP: mean < 120 \n\u03bcg\/L), only parts of the Swale and Ure were compliant. For nitrate, all reaches are \nclassified as \u201cmoderately low\u201d or better (mean mg nitrate-N\/L < 4.52), which \ncomplies with the EC Nitrates Directive legislation. Simulated classifications were \nlargely in accordance with observed data (Boorman, 2003a). Mismatches were only \napparent at the extremities of chemical percentile distributions. The model performed \nwell at reproducing flow time series. In terms of biology, current classification based \n4 \n \non macro-invertebrates reveals all reaches to be fairly good quality or better, many \nbeing in the highest class. Using existing standards, the Yorkshire Ouse is a largely \nclean river network.  \n \nThe capability of QUESTOR shown in the Ouse study (Boorman, 2003a) suggests it \nis suitable for the present study to address the following objectives:  \n1. Successful simulation of phytoplankton (chlorophyll-a) against measured data \nusing a dynamic river flow and quality model at a daily time-step; \n2. Test the hypothesis that residence time is the major control on spatial patterns \nin peak chlorophyll-a levels; \n3. Make indicative predictions of phytoplankton behaviour in response to climate \nprojections as summarised for the Ouse for 2080 (Johnson et al., 2009);   \n4. Identify mitigation options for different parts of the catchment and predict \ntheir effects, in each case carrying out a simple cost-effectiveness analysis.  \n \n2. Methodology \n \nAs the objectives include running scenarios involving perturbation of land-use, a \nlinked modelling approach was applied. The 1997-1999 period was chosen as it had \nmore abundant and spatially widespread chlorophyll-a data than at other times. To \nrepresent flows and nitrate concentrations from diffuse sources the NAL-CASCADE \nmodel was used (Hutchins et al., 2010) which is sensitive to changes in land \nmanagement (Hutchins et al., 2009). NAL-CASCADE was linked to QUESTOR, \nwhich, using observations from tributaries and effluents (sewage works and industry), \nrepresents the diffuse inputs of other substances and point sources. Whilst numerous \nmodels exist, covering a range of spatial scales (e.g. Johnes, 1996; Arnold et al., \n1998; Hutchins et al., 2002; Wade et al., 2002; Davison et al., 2008), changes in \nphosphorus concentrations from diffuse sources were not to be modelled explicitly. \nAlthough it is acknowledged that diffuse phosphorus can be a very important driver of \nriver ecological status in specific cases, the omission is made for various reasons. \nRecent evidence suggests such diffuse agriculturally-derived components are of less \nimportance than previously thought, accounting for less than 15% of the annual UK \nriverine P load (Jarvie et al., 2006; White and Hammond, 2009). Much of the diffuse \nphosphorus load is delivered to rivers during high flows in winter when algae are \nlargely absent or being flushed out, and the attribution of cause and effect between \nland applications and river concentrations is very complex (Neal et al., 2010a). Of the \nmitigation options available, Haygarth et al. (2009) show that micro-scale detention \nof mobilised P (e.g. by buffer zones) is more effective than the almost negligible \nimpact of reducing inputs (e.g. land-use change or reduced fertilisation), which is the \nprimary focus for controlling N.    \n \n2.1. Simulating water quality \n \nA land-use dataset (Posen et al., submitted), which combines landcover (CEH \nLCM2000: Fuller et al., 2002) and 2004 Defra Agricultural Census data, was spatially \nlinked to HOST soil class information (Boorman et al., 1995). Values for topsoil \nnitrate available for leaching (NAL) were calculated at monthly resolution for each \ncombination of land-use and soil (Hutchins et al., 2010). Along with gridded \nmeteorological inputs (daily rainfall and weekly\/fortnightly potential \nevapotranspiration) these NAL values were used in CASCADE, a model of catchment \n5 \n \nhydrology and diffuse pollution transfer to rivers (Cooper and Naden, 1998). Spatially \ndistributed into hydrological response units (HRUs) (Cooper and Naden, 1998; \nHutchins et al., 2010) CASCADE represents soils in two layers (topsoil and subsoil), \nand provides diffuse flows and nitrate concentrations as inputs to the 1-D river quality \nmodel, QUESTOR (Eatherall et al., 1998; Boorman, 2003a, b). Amongst a range of \nother determinands, QUESTOR simulates temperature, flow, pH, DO, BOD, nitrate, \nammonium, inorganic P, organic P, suspended sediment and chlorophyll-a. In \naddition to diffuse inputs, QUESTOR considers inputs from point sources, \nabstractions for water supply, aeration at weirs and in-river biochemical kinetic \ntransformations. A truncated river network was assumed (Figure 1), the upstream \nends of the network typically being defined by the location of a monitoring site. \nBoorman, (2003a) defines equations in QUESTOR for flow and chemical quality.  \n \n2.2. Calculating in-river transformation processes \n \nRate coefficients for the in-river transformations (namely nitrification, denitrification, \nbenthic oxygen demand, BOD decay, BOD sedimentation and P mineralisation) were \ndetermined by calibration against EA river chemical monitoring data from many sites \nwithin the defined network (Figure 1) typically available through fortnightly \nresolution grab samples. Chlorophyll-a data covering the 1997-1999 period were only \navailable at 13 sites in the upper reaches of the Ouse network (typically with 50-100 \nobservations in total per site). Of these, 5 of the sites are at or above the top of the \nnetwork and were used to provide the model with input time-series. Data from the \nother 8 sites aided calibration. Any robust calibration of phytoplankton photosynthetic \ngrowth rates is limited due to the lack of downstream sites. However for 1993-1996, \nLOIS data were available at 4 sites towards the bottom of the network (typically with \n150-200 observations per site). These slower flowing lower reaches have some \nphytoplankton blooms. So, data from 12 sites were used to define network-wide \nparameter values and assess model performance (Figure 1).  \n \n2.3. Hydrological representation \n \nCASCADE daily hydrological response was calibrated for the gauging stations at \nCatterick (27090) and Kilgram Bridge (27034) (Figure 1). These headwater areas, \npart of the Swale and Ure systems which were chosen for detailed analysis, are also \nthe only suitable gauged sub-catchments that are predominantly rural, permitting \ncalibration of flows from diffuse sources. For the Ouse catchment, the QUESTOR \nriver network consisted of 205 reaches and, as well as the main Ouse channel, \nrepresented 8 branches (Figure 1). These consisted of the main tributaries (Swale, Ure \nand Nidd) and some minor tributaries (Foss, Crimple Beck, Whiske and Cod Beck). \nThe model configuration of QUESTOR as described by Boorman (2003b) was used, \nas the main objective was to link water flow and quality with phytoplankton response.  \n \nThe linked model was used throughout the Yorkshire Ouse with the exception of the \nSwale where, due to the greater relative abundance of urban areas, a slightly different \napproach was undertaken. Here, to maximise the accuracy of the modelling as a basis \nfor the exploration of proposed measures focusing on cleaning-up of point rather than \ndiffuse sources, observed flow and nitrate data from small tributaries were used where \navailable, instead of applying NAL-CASCADE. Further details are given elsewhere \n(Ani et al., 2010). \n6 \n \n \n2.4. Simulating phytoplankton behaviour \n \nThe biological model used in QUESTOR comprises three autotroph types \n(phytoplankton, benthic algae and macrophytes: each with fixed stoichiometry \n(chlorophyll-a content c. 1% by mass)) determined by interrelated processes of \nphotosynthesis, respiration, death and predation. All types are active in water column \nDO and nutrient exchange. Phytoplankton alone contribute to water column \nchlorophyll-a, and, on death, a BOD and nutrient source. The photosynthetic rate is \nfirst order with respect to biomass and is temperature dependent (via the Arrhenius \nequation: Equation 1). Examples of water temperature data (Figure 2) show annual \nranges typical of the case-study area. As Equation 1 shows, maximum photosynthetic \nrate is limited by a multiplicative formulation of nutrients (f(N): minimum of N and P: \na hyperbolic relationship as defined by Michaelis Menten kinetics (Equation 2)) and \nlight (f(L)). For light limitation, (i) attenuation (\u03b3) with depth is described by the \nBeer-Lambert law (including effects of suspended sediment (SS) and the \nphytoplankton (Phy) themselves) (Equation 3), and (ii) photolimitation, with respect \nto autotroph-specific optimum intensities, is represented by the Steele (1962) \nformulation (Equation 4). Phytoplankton are assumed to be exposed to depth-\naveraged light. Limitation factors (where values lie between 0 (full limitation) and 1 \n(no limitation)) are calculated for every time-step in all reaches. The model is driven \nby photosynthetically-active radiation determined using weather station data for the \nCawood site (NGR 4575 4375) held at the NERC British Atmospheric Data Centre \n(Figure 2). Water temperature in each river reach is modelled by a weighted mixture \nof contributions from input sources with additional allowance made for the balance \nbetween incoming radiation (using the Cawood data) and outgoing long wave back \nradiation from the water surface.

Scenario analysis   \n \nThe impacts on river phytoplankton concentration of four scenarios were explored: \nA. Alter river flow, water temperature and solar radiation in line with UKCIP02 \nprojections to 2080 (Johnson et al., 2009): the \u201cClimate Change Scenario\u201d; \nB. Reduce SRP concentrations in effluent from sewage treatment works (STWs) \nby imposing tertiary treatment: the \u201cSTW scenario\u201d;  \nC. Abandon all agricultural land to moor\/grass\/heath: the \u201cAgriculture Scenario\u201d;  \nD. Plant riparian deciduous trees (e.g. alder, poplar, willow): the \u201cTree Scenario\u201d.  \nAll model inputs and parameters not affected by the specification of the scenarios \nwere held the same as for the 1997-1999 model application. Scenarios B, C and D \nrepresent an eventual steady state for which attainment, in particular for D, may take a \nlong time. \n \nThe \u201cClimate Change Scenario\u201d (A) considers the direct impacts of a changed climate \n(as opposed to any that may indirectly induce land-use change). Modifications to \nQUESTOR model inputs were made in accordance with projections for the Ouse \n(Johnson et al., 2009). These were taken from the UKCIP02 high emission scenario \nwhich used the HadCM3 General Circulation Model downscaled in space using the \nHadley Centre Regional Climate Model. Seasonal-specific changes relative to 1997-\n1999 were explored for water temperature and incoming solar radiation. For spring \nand summer the water temperature increase is projected to be 36% and 25% \nrespectively, whereas for solar radiation respective increases of 9% and 15% are \nprojected. For river flows, a constant reduction of 30% was implemented for all \nseasons and at all flow levels. This value was in very close accordance with the \nprojections for spring and summer conditions which are of most relevance to \nphytoplankton growth. Johnson et al. (2009) believe that nutrient concentrations will \nincrease, yet this assumption does not account for possible changes in land-use in \nresponse to new climate regimes. In this respect there is much uncertainty. In the \nscenario therefore, present day nutrient concentrations were used. \n \nThe \u201cSTW Scenario\u201d (B) was implemented in the Swale catchment upstream of \nThornton Manor (3\/39: Figure 1) where knowledge of nutrient cycling processes and \ndata for model parameterisation is more comprehensive than elsewhere (Bowes and \nHouse, 2001) and population density is higher than in neighbouring catchments (e.g. \nUre). To simulate implementation of tertiary treatment the concentrations of SRP \n(represented by inorganic P) and Total Phosphorus (TP: inorganic plus organic \nfractions) in STW effluents were capped at 1.5 and 2.0 mg P\/L respectively (Carey \nand Migliaccio, 2009), these levels representing a realistic compromise between \ncurrently-available technology and avoiding expenses that are disproportionate for \nsmall treatment works. The effect of the measure was to cap the P content in over \n85% of the total effluent volume discharging into the Swale system. The remaining \n15% comes from works that are far from the modelled main river network, and as a \nresult each of these must be represented as a portion of the input from a minor \ntributary, aggregated with other sources. Representation of such tributaries relies on \nobservations (in the case of phosphorus), so these particular works cannot easily be \nsubjected to hypothetical interventions. In the riverbed, a shift in the equilibrium \nbetween water and solid phase following the change in phosphorus loading from \n8 \n \nSTWs may occur and thereby influence the availability of phosphorus for \nphytoplankton growth. Data from the Thames in southern England suggest such re-\nequilibration processes may take many years and in some places sediment dredging \nmay also be necessary (Neal et al., 2010b). Concentrations of other chemical species \nentering the river from STW effluents remained unaltered. \n \nThe \u201cAgriculture Scenario\u201d (C) was implemented in the headwater catchments of the \nUre (above 27034: Kilgram Bridge) and Nidd (above 27005: Gouthwaite Reservoir) \n(Figure 1). The Ure was of particular interest as observed chlorophyll-a levels were \nthe highest in the entire Ouse network in the 1990s (Neal et al., 2006). The change to \nbe represented is a conversion out of production of 200 km\n2\n of arable land and \nagricultural grassland. For this area, a NAL value for non-agricultural grassland of 5 \nkg N\/ha per year (Silgram et al., 2004) was to be used throughout. A transfer function \nrepresenting hydrological leaching of solutes (Anthony et al., 1996) was applied to \nland-uses before and after the change. The relative decrease in nitrate leached \nquantified the scenario; implemented as a scaling factor applied to the daily \nCASCADE nitrate concentration outputs from the relevant HRUs, and then fed \nthrough into the QUESTOR simulation. Any change in nitrate concentrations in \nresponse to land management perturbations may take many years to be seen in soil \nleachate; taking much longer still to be manifested in rivers where groundwater \nsources dominate (Hutchins et al., 2010). Against that, any eventual reduction of \nphosphorus leaching to rivers resulting from the change in management (not included \nin specification of the scenario) can only be beneficial in reducing phytoplankton. \nOther diffuse chemical inputs were not altered. \n \nThe \u201cTree Scenario\u201d (D) was implemented in all the tributaries of the Ouse. Whilst \nsome experimental studies, as reviewed by Ghermandi et al. (2009), appear to suggest \nthat effects of tree shading on light availability are unlikely to be substantial in rivers \nas wide as those in the Ouse network, a recent model study (Dewalle, 2008) goes into \nmuch greater systematic and quantitative detail, indicating such a view to be unduly \npessimistic. Indeed the findings of Ghermandi et al. (2009) and others (e.g. Davies-\nColley and Quinn, 1998; Boothroyd et al., 2004; Caissie et al., 2007) are consistent \nwith the Dewalle (2008) model but all these study sites are dissimilar to the Ouse, \neither in terms of latitude or river width. In the Ouse, the reduction in intensity of \nsolar radiation reaching the water column due to tree shading was assumed to be 39%, \nas estimated using the method of DeWalle (2008). The method calculates shading as a \nfunction of site latitude, river flow direction and the ratio of the height of the riparian \nvegetation to the width of the riverbank. In this respect a 30m-wide channel with a \nmature 30m-high mixed canopy of alder, willow and poplar trees was assumed. In the \nminor tributaries (e.g. Wiske and Cod Beck) the channel is narrower, hence the \nassumptions allow for an inevitable degree of failure to plant throughout the network \nlength or to always achieve full canopy height. As the river channel flow aspect is \npredominantly NW to SE, flow direction was considered to be uniformly distributed \nbetween the extreme cases of north-south and east-west trending channels. Full \nreduction in intensity of solar radiation was only implemented between 1\nst\n May and \n30\nth\n November each year when deciduous trees are in leaf. The 39% figure was \nlinearly interpolated to\/from 100% transmittance for a 40 day period either side of the \nduration of full shading. Conceptually, tree planting induces a shading effect and also \nlowers water temperatures, as accounted for in the model using the dynamic water \nheading module. Satellite imagery reveals riparian shading to be currently fairly \n9 \n \nconsiderable in the catchment. Estimates suggest that this may be at approximately \n25% of capacity, but as trees are more abundant in the lower reaches of the Swale and \nUre than further upstream the interaction with effects due to residence time is likely to \nlimit the influence of this control on phytoplankton growth. The potential effects of \nexisting shading on chlorophyll-a were estimated in the present study but were not \nfully accounted for in terms of assessing scenarios.   \n \n2.6. Analysis of costs  \n \nCosts for removing phosphorus at sewage treatment works in the Swale are based on a \nmethod used to support Defra policy on reducing phosphorus inputs to freshwaters \n(e.g. Defra, 2009). In this method, regressions relate detailed estimates of expenditure \nfor a large sample of UK STWs to the known \u201cpeople equivalents\u201d served by each \nworks. Calculation of costs for the \u201cAgriculture Scenario\u201d (C) covers the Ure \nheadwaters and assumes that landowners receive compensation equating to the profit \nachievable from the lost agricultural land.  Profits are assumed to be approximately \n25% of the change in farm gross margin (as modelled by Fezzi et al. (2010)), the \nexact fraction depending on farm type (Fezzi et al., 2008). For the \u201cTree Scenario\u201d \n(D) costs were estimated for planting at 5m intervals along both banks of all \ntributaries of the Ouse. The estimates were based on reports provided by Forest \nResearch (Bill Jones, personal communication). It was assumed that labour costs \ncontribute approximately 20% as, due to access constraints, most of the riverbank \nlength would be more appropriately planted by hand than by machine. Other \ncomponents to the costs were: plants (44%), guards for saplings (32%), infilling \nsubsequent to initial planting (4%). \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \n3.1. Presentation and interpretation of results \n \nTime-series model performance was evaluated using the efficiency criterion (E) (Nash \nand Sutcliffe, 1970). Due largely to the paucity of chlorophyll-a observations in the \nOuse network (see Section 2.2), a variety of graphical methods as well as the \ncommonly used time-series plots of observed and simulated values (Figure 3: Swale \nand Ure) were used. Chlorophyll-a data were pooled together into two groups, one \nrepresenting 8 upstream sites and the other representing 4 from the lower reaches \ndownstream. Monthly median and 75\nth\n percentile (upper quartile) values were \ncalculated for each group, compared with summary statistics from the daily model \nsimulations for the same sites and displayed graphically (Figure 4). Individually for \neach of the 12 sites, comparison was made of observed and simulated 95\nth\n percentile \nchlorophyll-a values (Figure 5), hereafter referred to as peak levels, which represent \nelevated concentrations in the spring-summer growing season. For the Swale and Ure \ntributaries the longitudinal change downstream in modelled median spring\/summer \nconcentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a (Figure 6) illustrates the build up of \nflows and development of blooms down the system. Adding the projected plot for \nchlorophyll-a in 2080 shows a best estimate of how this may change in the future. \nFinally, time-series plots of model output illustrating the impact of scenarios in the \nSwale are shown (Figure 7).     \n \n3.2. In-river transformations and hydrochemical response \n10 \n \n \nThrough the calibration process, QUESTOR modelling gave an indication of in-river \ntransformation rates and their spatial variability in the Ouse (Table 2). Other studies \nreveal that these rates also vary temporally (Pattinson et al., 1998; Ani et al., 2010). \nThe network of site locations in the first column (relating Table 2 to Figure 1) \nprovided the spatial framework for calibration. The calibration process is very \nnecessary as a sensitivity analysis of previous QUESTOR applications in the Ouse \nnetwork (Deflandre et al., 2006) suggested transformations to be at least as important \nas other elements of model structure revealed to be fundamental, namely a sound \ndescription of flow routing constants defining velocity (already optimised: see \nBoorman(2003c)) and a rigorous characterisation of tributary inputs. As well as being \nnet sources of SRP, most reaches showed net nitrate sources (nitrification \npredominant) although some reaches in the middle Swale and upper Ure appeared to \nbe net sinks (denitrification dominant). In the lower reaches of all rivers benthic \noxygen demand and BOD decay were important. In keeping with previous \napplications of QUESTOR in the Ouse (Lewis et al., 1997; Boorman, 2003c) there \nwas generally good agreement between model and observations for all determinands, \ncorrectly classifying chemistry in the majority of cases. Throughout the network, as \nillustrated for the Swale and Ure (Figure 3a), errors in flow simulation at low flows \nwere mostly overestimates; these impinge on overall chemical model performance \n(Table 4 and Figure 3b, 3c). Nutrient concentrations may be underestimated for this \nreason although such errors can also be attributable to omission of a point source and \nthere may be two possible instances of this: in the Nidd and in the Foss. \n \n3.3. Biological response \n \nOptimised values for biological parameters (Table 3) were the same as those used \nbefore for the Ouse by Boorman (2003b), with the exception of the maximum \nphytoplankton growth rate, which was lower previously (3.0). Arriving at a higher \nvalue was a compromise, wherein peak levels were overestimated at some sites \ndownstream (in the Swale (3\/39) and Ouse (9\/19)) whilst isolated moderately high \nvalues (approximately 50 \u03bcg\/L) were underestimated in some of the smaller \ntributaries (e.g. Crimple Beck (1\/8)). The death rate parameter was not altered. Wider \nimpacts of phytoplankton on DO are controlled by whether or not and when the \nblooms are grazed, die or are flushed out of the freshwater system beyond the tidal \nlimit. Although Whitehead and Hornberger (1984) and Balbi (2000) used \nphaeopigment data to infer degradation rates, little is known to help constrain \nuncertainty in death rate. Implications of this are only likely to be substantial in \neutrophic rivers.   \n \nThe expected spring-summer elevation in network-wide monthly values was a lot \nhigher in the pool of downstream sites than in the upstream group (Figure 4). Values \nof the 75\nth\n percentile were closely reproduced by the model for all months in both \ngroups, supporting the hypothesis of residence time being the dominant control on \nchlorophyll-a concentration. However, there was a systematic overestimation of \nmonthly medians. Though the magnitude of phytoplankton blooms was simulated \nwell, these blooms may be quicker forming and more ephemeral than represented by \nthe model. In the Ouse network, regression analysis suggested that residence time, as \nrepresented by catchment area (x), could explain much of the variability in modelled \npeak chlorophyll-a (y=0.012x +9.384, r\n2\n=0.76, n=12, p<0.001). Whilst this supports \n11 \n \nNeal et al. (2006), much complexity is hidden, and other studies (e.g. Balbi, 2000) \nidentify specific localised factors which may explain scatter in this relationship. At \nindividual sites model performance for peak chlorophyll-a values was reasonable \n(Figure 5) but mismatches reveal the elusive nature and importance of these local \nfactors. Data from 1993-1996 showed high phytoplankton levels in the Ure, higher \nthan in the Swale and also than in the main Ouse downstream (Figure 5); and \nmanagement plans covering the river network going back over 15 years (e.g. NRA, \n1994; Environment Agency, 2009) have specifically highlighted eutrophication issues \nin the upper Ure. In contrast, the model simulated similar levels in the Ure and the \nSwale. Given the apparent sensitivity of phytoplankton growth to shading, the \nrelatively higher concentrations in the Swale of light\u2013attenuating suspended \nsediments (SS) (Table 1) may offer an explanation. The predominant source of the \nelevated levels in the Swale has been attributed to bank erosion (Lawler et al., 1999). \nFurthermore, the middle reaches of the Swale are more densely shaded by trees than \nthose in the Ure. Another plausible explanation is apparent from data on river channel \nproperties (River Habitat Survey: Raven et al., 1998) which suggest that overall the \nUre may be the widest river in the network, a feature not revealed by the limited data \nat gauging stations on which model setups to date have been based (Lewis et al., \n1997). Consequently it is likely that patches of shallow water which heat up markedly \nduring direct sunshine and enhance phytoplankton growth are more prevalent in the \nUre than elsewhere. A future research priority should be to pinpoint how surveys of \nstream channel morphology can best help determine realistic river width and depth \nparameters for use by 1-D river quality models.   \n \nAside from the effects of dilution due to inputs of low chlorophyll-a waters from short \ntributaries or STWs, the model simulated a gradual increase in peak levels along the \nsystem as residence time increases (Figure 6). This is reflected in the simulated \nclassification of trophic status based on May-September median (Table 5): most of the \nnetwork was oligotrophic, only changing to mesotrophic in the lower reaches of the \nSwale, Ure and Nidd and further downstream in the main Ouse. Simulated \nphytoplankton populations were significant between April and September, and were \nshort-lived, being flushed out of the system by high flow events rather than dying or \nbeing grazed. Results from the lower reaches of the network showed that in 1997-\n1999 there was more than enough N and P for photosynthesis, even in the Ure (Figure \n6b). The calculated growth limiting factors did not fall below 0.9 and 0.8 for N and P \nrespectively. The main controls were light (for which the limiting factor frequently \nfell below 0.6, even in summer) and water temperature. In the headwaters upstream of \nthe dominant STWs there may be slightly more nutrient limitation, as shown for the \nUre and Swale (Figure 6, vis-a-vis half saturation constant values in Table 3). Whilst \nmany empirical analyses show strong relationships between TP and phytoplankton \nboth (i) in surveys across many river sites (e.g. Soballe and Kimmel, 1987; van \nNiewenhuyse and Jones, 1996; Royer et al., 2008) and (ii) in long-term high-\nresolution time-series data at individual sites (e.g. Kinniburgh and Barnett, 2009), this \ndoes not demonstrate that phosphorus limitation is critical to phytoplankton \nabundance. The QUESTOR modelling also revealed a link with TP, but it did not \nqualify as the major limiting factor. \n \nThe magnitude of chlorophyll-a peaks varied considerably from year-to-year. In \ncomparing Figures 2 and 7 the model implied this variation to be strongly related to \nwater temperature (and probably sunshine hours). Levels in 1998 were lower than in \n12 \n \nthe other years modelled. Modelling in the present study did not include silicon \nlimitation, nor did it embody the biological complexity that could result in a mid-\nsummer suppression of phytoplankton growth. Highest values were simulated in July \n(Figure 4), later than observations suggest (May). However, as data are currently \nlimited, evidence for shortcomings in the model predictive capability due to a lack of \ndiscrimination between different phytoplankton groups is not compelling. \n \n3.4. Climate change scenario (A) \n \nIn the scenario used here, phytoplankton blooms are liable to increase dramatically in \nthe Ouse network, changing the trophic status considerably (Table 5) despite the \ngenerally good chemical status of waters currently seen throughout. Predicted \nincreases of over 150% in peak chlorophyll-a occurred in more than half the reaches. \nIn the Ouse and the lower reaches of its main tributaries these peak values showed a \nthree- to five-fold increase. The change in May-September median levels as flows and \nwater residence time build up along two of the main tributaries (Swale and Ure) are \ncompared with the present day picture (Figure 6). Shift from oligotrophic\/mesotrophic \nstatus to one dominated by mesotrophic or eutrophic conditions is likely. Re-running \nthe model scenario with present day flows reveals that effects attributable to \nprojections of radiation and water temperature alone represented on average 53% of \nthe future increase in chlorophyll-a on a reach-by-reach basis.  \n \nBy 2080 the greatly enhanced biomass of phytoplankton and associated nutrient \ndemand could render the levels of nutrient supply (as seen currently) to be of a \nsubstantial limiting influence on growth. It appears that under the mesotrophic-\noligotrophic conditions of the present day Ouse network, light and heat are the \npredominant limiting factors, whereas in the projected future state the growth of \nblooms would, in certain reaches of the Ure, be limited by nutrient supply as well as \nby light. The effect is only seen in the Ure (Figure 6b), because in the Swale nutrient \nlevels rapidly increase downstream (Figure 6a) due to the more considerable point \nsource contribution. The outcome would result in severe blooms being ephemerally \ncurtailed either by nutrient supply, or, as is the case with the less severe blooms seen \ncurrently, by flow events. Therefore it seems that the influence of nutrient limitation \nwould be to prevent blooms from becoming prolonged. However, beneficial effects \nwould be short lived, probably not substantial and have minimal influence on the \ninitial establishment of phytoplankton populations in the spring.  \n \n3.5. Management-related scenarios (B, C and D) \n \nCarrying out the \u201cSTW Scenario\u201d (B), although reducing mean annual SRP by 37% \n(from 210 to 133 \u00b5g\/L), will only reduce peak chlorophyll-a by 11% (from 26.1 to \n23.1 \u00b5g\/L) in the Swale lower reaches (3\/39) at Thornton Manor (Figure 7). \nImplementing measures of this type is underway in much of the UK. In the Swale this \nimplementation should make achieving WFD standards for SRP realistic but in itself \nwill probably do little for river ecology. Nevertheless, if TP concentrations from \nSTWs were further reduced to 0.1 mg\/L, effectively eliminating point sources, it is \ninteresting to note that though the additional decrease in river SRP at Thornton Manor \nachieved (to 111 \u00b5g\/L) would be small, it would be accompanied by a substantial \nfurther suppression of phytoplankton (to 20.6 \u00b5g chl-a\/L, a 21% decrease relative to \nthe baseline). However, if, in addition to cutting TP in STW effluents to 2.0 mg\/L, the \n13 \n \nentire River Swale channel (and its main tributaries) were also to be shaded from \nincoming solar radiation (\u201cTree Scenario\u201d (D)), though no further reduction in river \nSRP would occur, a much larger overall reduction in peak chlorophyll-a at Thornton \nManor (44%) would be achievable. \n \nThe \u201cAgriculture Scenario\u201d (C) may discernibly reduce peak chlorophyll-a levels, \nalthough it is only substantially effective in areas of negligible point source input. A \n10% reduction for the Ure at Boroughbridge (4\/46) (from 33.3 to 30.1\u00b5g\/L) is \npredicted. Although the beneficial effect in the Nidd (2\/44) is much less (2%), some \nreduction was predicted for the main Ouse (2%) despite dilution from other rivers \nunaffected by the scenario. The greater effectiveness of the measure in the Ure is not \nsurprising given that nutrient levels are currently lower than elsewhere. Alternatively \nhowever, implementation of the \u201cTree Scenario\u201d (D) is far more effective, reducing \npeak chlorophyll-a by 47% in the Ure (to 17.7 \u00b5g\/L). A similar level of reduction is \nseen in the Nidd. The effects of shading on solar radiation reaching the water column \nin the Swale, Ure and Nidd are less than those projected for the narrower (typically \n12m wide) Nete in Belgium (Ghermandi et al., 2009), although the impacts on \nchlorophyll-a appear to be similar. \n \nIf current levels of riparian shading are accounted for in model calculations any \nreduction in effectiveness of this scenario appears likely to be small (approximately \n7%). So, for combating the likely detrimental effects of climate change, it is \nconcluded that riparian shading is the most appropriate of the management strategies \nconsidered here. Model estimates suggest shading could prevent 88% of the projected \nincrease in peak chlorophyll-a in the Ure. Shading is also the least costly option \n(Table 6). Of the \u00a30.27m quoted, approximately \u00a30.15m accounts for planting in the \nUre and Swale.  \n \nThe model study shows that it is important to prioritise mitigation actions specific to \nphytoplankton in headwater areas where the water travel time in the freshwater \nenvironment is longest. In contrast, much attention in the past has focused on the \nlower parts of catchments near tidal limits which often have intense land-use and most \nsevere pollution. Importantly, phytoplankton levels in the lower reaches of large \nrivers are heavily dependent and sensitive to management decisions made in upstream \nheadwater areas. Whilst there may be more scope to reduce pollutant leaching and \nimprove river chemistry in the lower parts of catchments, it appears that such effort \nwould have little impact on river phytoplankton. \n \n3.6. Summary of modelling outcomes \n \n Most reaches in the system are net nutrient sources; \n Simulated chlorophyll-a levels and their increase downstream was broadly in \nline with the limited observations available; \n Model performance for flow and chemical parameters in the Swale and Ure \nwas acceptable in providing a basis for scenario analysis. \n Under climate change projections, downstream parts of the Ouse network are \nlikely to become eutrophic, roughly half of the increase being attributable to \nchanges in temperature and radiation; \n Reducing the inputs of phosphorus from point sources in the Swale catchment \nwill lower the peak chlorophyll-a levels but probably not by more than 10%; \n14 \n \n A similar level of improvement is likely if land in the headwaters of the Ure \nwere to be taken out of agricultural production; \n Planting riparian trees is a considerably more promising measure and is more \ncost-effective than the others tested, reducing peak chlorophyll-a levels by \nmore than 30-40%, and probably one capable of offsetting most of the \ndetrimental impacts of climate change.  \n \n4. Conclusion \n \nThe findings of this study are of UK- and European-wide relevance. In moving \ntowards WFD implementation, UKTAG (2008) state the importance of phytoplankton \nbiomass as an important metric due to its influence on light penetration and oxygen in \nwater bodies. Whilst the predictions should be refined and updated as increasingly-\nsubstantiated climate change projections become available, the study highlights the \ndanger of a currently clean river system (in terms of chemical and biological \nindicators) becoming considerably impacted with phytoplankton blooms by 2080. \nGreater confidence in our knowledge of the system as represented in models is \nessential as we face an uncertain climatic future. To this end more comprehensive \nlong-term monitoring will be vital. Continuous monitoring technology for DO \n(Williams et al., 2000) and chlorophyll-a has become more commonplace recently. \nCoupled with the possibilities afforded by earth observation to record the \ndevelopment of blooms down a river system (Hunter et al., 2008) this will aid \nunderstanding of the wider impacts of phytoplankton, particularly on DO and fish \nhabitats. In this context, a shorter model time-step (e.g. hourly) would be advisable. \n \nThe main issues arising from the modelling study are of much wider relevance than \njust to the Ouse and are as follows: \n Whilst between-year variability at any site is likely to be large, residence time \nis the dominant control on phytoplankton in the Ouse network. However, \nreconciling model results with observations reveals (i) likelihood of important \nlocal controls and (ii) need to consider in more detail the complexity of the \nbiological system; \n Phytoplankton growth does not appear to be strongly limited by current levels \nof nutrient supply; \n Substantial nutrient limitation, whereby peak chlorophyll-a is cut by over \n20%, is only likely if nutrient loads are cut to levels seen in near-pristine \nenvironments where STW and agricultural influence is negligible; \n In terms of river quality, management measures required of the scenarios will \ntake many years (decades) to reach full effectiveness; \n WFD compliance could be attained more cost-effectively by controlling light \nconditions through riparian shading rather than curtailing nutrient inputs. \n In general, any mitigation strategy related to phytoplankton is more likely to \nbe effective if targeted in headwater areas. \n \nAcknowledgements: Helen Davies (CEH) is thanked for her help in preparing \nmeteorological data for model input.
