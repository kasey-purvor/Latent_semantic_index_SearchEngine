Among those, Kulkarni et al. (2001) proposed a product mod-\neling approach to study connection flows. Related to that product modeling\nframework, the M\/G\/\u221e queueinging model appeared as a limiting process in\nResnick and Samorodnitsky (2001). The M\/G\/\u221e model has also been used\nto model aggregated traffic [Guerin et al.(2003)]. See Chapter 7 of Kulka-\nrni (1995) for an introduction to queueinging theory and this model.\nWe consider the nonparametric estimation of the service time distribution G,\nwith limited information, in anM\/G\/\u221e queueinging model, where the arrival\nEmail address: juhyun.park@lancaster.ac.uk (Juhyun Park).\n1 Present address: Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, LA1 4YF, U.K. (Tel)+44 (0)1524 593606 (Fax) +44 (0)1524 592681\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier 21 May 2007\nprocess is Poisson with intensity \u03bb. For the discrete-time M\/G\/\u221e queueing\nmodel, see Pickands and Stine (1997). Bingham and Pitts (1999) developed\nnonparametric methods for theM\/G\/\u221e queueing model based on the Laplace\ntransform and gave an analytic representation in terms of infinite series of\nconvolutions.\nThe auxiliary function used in Bingham and Pitts (1997) is a simple and nat-\nural choice, which forms the basis of our first approach in Section 2. Often the\nidea of converting a Laplace inversion formulation to that of Fourier inversion\nsimplifies the problem and works equally well. See Dubner and Abate (1968)\nand Abate et al. (1999). But it turns out that caution is required to prevent\nnumerical problems for certain cases. Particular numerical instability issues\nencountered by the auxiliary function are investigated in detail in Section 3.\nIn Section 4, we propose a new auxiliary function, which solves the instability\nproblem. The modified auxiliary function provides a basis for the estimators\ndeveloped by Hall and Park (2004).\n2 FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM\nLet Y have the distribution of the busy period in theM\/G\/\u221e queueing model,\nwhose distribution function is denoted by B. The Laplace transform of B is\ngiven by\n\u221e\u222b\n0\ne\u2212st dB(t) = 1 + s\/\u03bb\u2212\n(\n\u03bb\n\u221e\u222b\n0\ne\u2212sta0(t) dt\n)\u22121 < (s) > 0 , (1)\nwhere\na0(t) = exp\n[\n\u2212 \u03bb\nt\u222b\n0\n{1\u2212G(x)} dx\n]\n. (2)\nThis fundamental result is due to Shanbhag (1966) and Hall (1988), and is\nnamed the Shanbhag-Hall theorem. Note that a0 leads directly to both the\nservice time distribution G and its density g. In particular, solving (2) for G\nand differentiating gives\nG =\na\u20320\n\u03bb a0\n+ 1 , g =\n1\n\u03bb\n{\na\u2032\u20320\na0\n\u2212 (a\n\u2032\n0)\n2\na20\n}\n. (3)\nThe key to construction of an estimator of G for this situation is to find\nreliable estimators of a0, a\n\u2032\n0 and a\n\u2032\u2032\n0. Define the characteristic function of the\n2\nbusy period distribution, B, to be \u03c8(s) = E(eisY ) for real s and denote\n\u03b1(s) = \u03bb\u22121 {1\u2212 \u03c8(s)\u2212 is\u03bb\u22121}\u22121 . (4)\nFrom (1), it follows that\n\u03b1(s) =\n\u221e\u222b\n0\na0(t) e\nist dt . (5)\nThus, the auxiliary function a0 may be represented using the Fourier inversion\nformula as\na0(t) =\n2\npi\n\u221e\u222b\n0\n{<\u03b1(s)} cos(st) ds , (6)\nwhich allows simple estimation by replacing \u03b1 in (4) by its empirical counter-\npart.\n3 NUMERICAL PERFORMANCE\nThis section provides a numerical example that shows instability of the use of\nthe auxiliary function a0. Consider an exponential assumption on G with rate\nparameter, \u00b5, as a special case of an M\/G\/\u221e queueing model. We focus on\nthree cases: (\u03bb = 1, \u00b5 = 1), (\u03bb = 2, \u00b5 = .5) and (\u03bb = .5, \u00b5 = 2), to study the\neffect of longer or shorter busy periods.\nFigure 1(a) shows the estimates of \u03bb a0(\u00b7) along with the true value for the\nthree different cases. They were computed based on a sample size of 1000. The\ntop and bottom cases in the left shows very poor estimation, while the second\nappears better.\nTo examine the possibility of too small a sample size, the estimators were\ncalculated for much larger sample sizes. Figure 2 shows a zoomed in view\nfor \u03bb = 2, \u00b5 = .5 (the best case shown in Figure 1(a)), which suggests rapid\nconvergence to a curve different from the true curve.\nA Q-Q diagnostic plot can be used to explore the cause of this poor estimation.\nWe examined the tail behavior of the samples of the busy period distribution\nwith the relatively longer (\u03bb = 2, \u00b5 = .5) and shorter (\u03bb = .5, \u00b5 = 2) ones. The\ntail index was estimated by distribution matching at two quantiles (.95, .995),\nassuming both Pareto-like tails and Weibull-like tails, which are presented in\n3\n00.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n\u03bb = 1, \u00b5 = 1\nest\ntrue\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n\u03bb = 2, \u00b5 = 0.5\nest\ntrue\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n\u03bb = 0.5, \u00b5 = 2\n(a) original\nest\ntrue\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n\u03bb = 1, \u00b5 = 1\nest\ntrue\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n\u03bb = 2, \u00b5 = 0.5\nest\ntrue\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n\u03bb = 0.5, \u00b5 = 2\n(b) modified\nest\ntrue\nFig. 1. Estimates \u03bb a0(t) from simulated data for different rate parameter. While\nplots in the left ((a) original) suggest large estimation error for \u00b5 \u2265 \u03bb, plots in the\nright ((b) modified) show serious improvements.\nFigure 3. The Q-Q plot shows how closely the data correspond to the assumed\ndistribution. They are closer to the true distribution when the curve is closer\nto the 45 degree line. To account for sampling variability, 100 samples from\nthe true distribution, also of the same size of 10000, are overlayed to give\nan envelope indicating the natural sampling variation. The thick curve is the\nactual data Q-Q plot and \u03b1 is an estimate of the respective shape parameter.\nAlthough possibly longer, the tail index is far from that of heavy tails, which\nrules out heaviness of the tails as a cause of the problem.\nAnother potential cause of the instability seen in Figure 1(a) is the Fourier\ninversion of a0. Consider s = \u2212iy (y 6= 0). Then we have\n\u221e\u222b\n0\neiyta0(t) dt = \u03bb\n\u22121{1\u2212 iy\u03bb\u22121 \u2212 \u03c6(y)}\u22121 .\nObserve that the right hand side is well defined so that the left hand side\n4\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.1\n0.8\n0.82\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n1\n Behavior close to 0: \u03bb = 2 \u00b5 = 0.5\n1000\n10000\n100000\ntrue\nFig. 2. Estimating a0(t) with increasing sample size: zoomed in (i.e. t \u2208 (0, .1)) view\nfor the second case (\u03bb = 2, \u00b5 = .5) shown in Figure 1(a).\nconverges for y 6= 0. But it does not converge absolutely because\n\u221e\u222b\n0\n|eista0(t)| dt =\n\u221e\u222b\n0\na0(t) \u2265\n\u221e\u222b\n0\ne\u2212\u03bb\u03c4 =\u221e ,\nwhere \u03c4 is the mean of the service time distribution satisfying \u03c4 =\n\u222b\u221e\n0 {1 \u2212\nG(x)} dx. Similarly, it can be shown that a0 is not square integrable. In either\ncase, Fourier inversion formula cannot be verified. While such integrability\nconditions often seem like a technicality, this turns out to be critical. Alter-\nnatively we may consider <\u03b1(s) for real s > 0. Write \u03c61(s) = <\u03c6(s) and\n\u03c62(s) = =\u03c6(s). Then, we have\n\u03bb<\u03b1(s) = 1\u2212 \u03c6(s){\u03c61(s)\u2212 1}2 + {\u03c62(s) + (s\/\u03bb)}2 .\nAs s\u2192 0, it can be shown that\nlim\ns\u21920\u03bb<\u03b1(s) =\nEY 2\n2(EY + \u03bb\u22121)2\n,\nwhile it is not defined at s = 0. Again, one would need to consider modifi-\ncations in the transform as in Beylkin (1995) to deal with such cases.

Q-Q plots for testing Weibull-like tail and Pareto-like tail for the busy period\ndistribution. Top plots are for Weibull-like tail and bottom ones are for Pareto-like\ntail. Left plots assume (\u03bb = 2, \u00b5 = .5) and right ones assume (\u03bb = .5, \u00b5 = 2). The\nestimates suggest to exclude the possibility of heaviness of tails.\nother numerical stability issues related to Fourier analysis can be found e.g.\nin Deraedt (1996) and Korn (2005). In the next section, we propose a simple\nsolution by reformulating the problem.\n4 MODIFIED AUXILIARY FUNCTION\nA means of overcoming this integrability problem is to consider complex values\nof s in (1). In particular, define an analytic characteristic function \u03c8(s) =\nE(eisY ) for a complex value s = u + iv, where u and v are real numbers.\nEquivalently, we have\n\u221e\u222b\n0\neist a0(t) dt=\n\u221e\u222b\n0\neiut{e\u2212vta0(t)} dt\n6\n=\u03bb\u22121\n{\n1 + (v \u2212 iu)\u03bb\u22121 \u2212\n\u221e\u222b\n0\neiute\u2212vt dB(t)\n}\u22121\n.\nWe shall always take v > 0. Observe that\n\u221e\u222b\n0\ne\u2212vta0(t) dt \u2264\n\u221e\u222b\n0\ne\u2212vt dt <\u221e .\nSo, a more tractable auxiliary function is a(t) = e\u2212vta0(t). The Fourier trans-\nforms in the complex plane has been introduced and developed in Paley and\nWiener (1934). For the transform of a function vanishing exponentially, the\ncomplex Fourier transform is well defined and converges absolutely and uni-\nformly. Here we have only borrowed the complex formulation to obtain an\nexponential decaying function and the modified problem allows us to apply\nthe ordinary real Fourier transform. Therefore, we may still be able to express\nthe service time distribution function G and its density g in terms of a and\nits derivatives as\nG =\na\u2032\n\u03bb a\n+\nv\n\u03bb\n+ 1 , g =\n1\n\u03bb\n{\na\u2032\u2032\na\n\u2212 (a\n\u2032)2\na2\n}\n.\nThus, an estimator of G and its density g may be constructed based on esti-\nmators of a, a\u2032 and a\u2032\u2032. Figure 1(b) in the right shows serious improvement of\nthe estimation using the same setup in the left. Now the large gaps between\nthe estimated and the true curves have all disappeared, although there is some\nnumerical instability towards the right end.\nThe choice of v is related to finite approximation error. Some simulation stud-\nies in Hall and Park (2004) suggest robustness of the choice of v in the per-\nformance of the estimator on a reasonable range of values. However numerical\nerror analysis is beyond our scope and for further details we refer the reader\nto Dubner and Abate (1968).\nReferences\nAbate, J., Choudhury, G. L., Whitt, W., 1999.
