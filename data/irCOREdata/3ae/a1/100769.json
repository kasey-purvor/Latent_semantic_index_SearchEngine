China\n(Dated: February 2, 2008)\nThe electromagnetic decay contributions to J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P , where V and P stand for vector and\npseudoscalar meson, respectively, are investigated in a vector meson dominance (VMD) model. We\nshow that J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P can be constrained well with the available experimental information.\nWe find that this process has significant contributions in \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 V P and may play a key role in\nunderstanding the deviations from the so-called \u201c12% rule\u201d for the branching ratio fractions between\n\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 V P and J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P . We also address that the \u201c12% rule\u201d becomes very empirical in exclusive\nhadronic decay channels.\nPACS numbers: 12.40.Vv, 13.20.Gd, 13.25.-k\nThe decay of charmonia into light hadrons is rich of information about QCD strong interactions between\nquarks and gluons. Due to the flavor change in the cc\u00af annihilation, it is also ideal for the study of light\nhadron production mechanisms, and useful for probing their flavor and gluon contents, such as the\nsearch for experimental evidence for glueball and hybrid. In the past decade, data for J\/\u03c8 decays have\nexperienced a drastic improvement. We now not only have access to small branching ratio at order of\n10\u22126, but also have much precise measurements of most of those old channels from BES, DM2 and Mark-\nIII. Such a significant improvement will allow a systematic analysis of correlated channels, from which\nwe expect that dynamical information about the light hadron production mechanisms can be extracted.\nIn this work, we will study the electromagnetic (EM) decay of vector charmonia (J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032) into light\nvector and pseudoscalar. From an empirical viewpoint, one can separate the decays of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 V P\ninto two classes: i) Isospin conserved channels such as J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0, K\u2217K\u00af, \u03c9\u03b7, \u03c6\u03b7, etc. These are\ndecays via both strong and EM transitions; ii) Isospin violated channels such as J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03c1\u03b7, \u03c1\u03b7\u2032, \u03c9\u03c00,\nand \u03c6\u03c0, of which the leading decay amplitudes are from EM transitions. In association with the above\nseparation is the observation that branching ratios for some of those isospin violated channels [1], such as\nJ\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03c1\u03b7, \u03c1\u03b7\u2032 and \u03c9\u03c00, are compatible with the isospin conserved ones such as \u03c9\u03b7\u2032 and \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 in J\/\u03c8\ndecays, and \u03c1\u03c0, \u03c9\u03b7, \u03c9\u03b7\u2032, \u03c6\u03b7, \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 in \u03c8\u2032 decays. This observation shows that the EM transition may not be\nas small as we thought in comparison with the strong one. Therefore, its roles played in J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 V P\nshould be closely investigated.\nOn a more general ground, the decay channel J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 V P has attracted a lot of attention in the\nliterature due to its property that the characteristic pQCD helicity conservation rule is violated here [2].\nAs a consequence, the pQCD power suppression occurs in this channel and leads to a relation for the\nratios between J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 annihilating into three gluons and a single direct photon:\nR \u2261\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 hadrons)\nBR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 hadrons)\n\u2243\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 e+e\u2212)\nBR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 e+e\u2212)\n\u2243 12%, (1)\nwhich is empirically called \u201c12% rule\u201d. However, much stronger suppressions are found in \u03c1\u03c0 channel,\ni.e. BR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0)\/BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0) \u2243 (2.0 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10\u22123, which gives rise to the so-called \u201c\u03c1\u03c0 puzzle\u201d.\nNamely, there exist large deviations from the above empirical \u201c12% rule\u201d in exclusive channels such as\n\u03c1\u03c0 and K\u2217K\u00af + c.c.\nAs we know that the \u201c12% rule\u201d is based on the expectation that the charmonium 3g strong decays\nare the dominant ones in exclusive decay channels, the large deviations from the \u201c12% rule\u201d in \u03c1\u03c0 and\nK\u2217K\u00af + c.c. naturally imply some underlying mechanisms which can interfere with the 3g decays and\nchange the branching ratio fractions. Theoretical explanations for the \u201c12% rule\u201d deviations have been\n2proposed in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], but so far none of those\nsolutions has been indisputably agreed [18, 19]. This makes it necessary to provide a detailed study\nof the charmonium EM decays. If compatible strength of the EM transition occurs in some of those\nexclusive decay channels, one can imagine that large interferences between the EM and strong transitions\nare possible, and they may be one of the important sources which produce large deviations from the\n\u201c12% rule\u201d in V P decay channels. Relevant studies can also be found in the literature for understanding\nthe role played by the EM transitions in J\/\u03c8 decays. Parametrization schemes are proposed to estimate\nthe EM decay contributions to J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P in Refs. [20, 21], but a coherent study of J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032 is still\nunavailable.\nApart from the above interests, the EM decay of J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P is also rich of dynamical information about\nthe Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule [22]. The decay of J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c00 involves both isospin and OZI-rule\nviolations. Although only the upper limit, BRexp(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c00) < 6.4 \u00d7 10\u22126, is given, this will be an\ninteresting place to test dynamical prescriptions for J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P . In Refs. [5, 8], apart from the\nEM process, the OZI doubly disconnected processes are also investigated, which however possesses large\nuncertainties. In particular, the separation of these two correlated processes is strongly model-dependent.\nIn this work, we will introduce an effective Lagrangian for V \u03b3P couplings, and apply the vector meson\ndominance (VMD) model to V \u03b3\u2217 couplings. By studying the J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P at tree level, we shall\nexamine the \u201c12% rule\u201d for those exclusive V P decay channels. Deviations from this empirical rule in\nthe exclusive decays can thus be highlighted.\nFor J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03c9\u03b7, \u03c9\u03b7\u2032, \u03c6\u03b7, \u03c6\u03b7\u2032, \u03c1\u03c0 and K\u2217K\u00af + c.c., the strong and EM decay process are mixed,\nand the former generally plays a dominant role. For J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03c1\u03b7, \u03c1\u03b7\u2032, \u03c9\u03c0, and \u03c6\u03c0, the transitions are\nvia EM processes, of which the isospin conservation is violated. Typical transitions for V1 \u2192 V2P are\nillustrated by Fig. 1, which consists of three contributions: (a) the process that the pseudoscalar meson\nis produced in association with the virtual photon via V1 annihilation; (b) the pseudoscalar produced at\nthe final state vector meson V2 vertex; and (c) the pseudoscalar produced via the axial current anomaly.\nNote that isospin conservation can be violated in both Fig. 1(a) and (b), with the observation of non-zero\nbranching ratios for J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c00 [1]. At hadronic level, these are independent processes where all the\nvertices can be determined by other experimental measurements. This treatment is different from that of\nRefs. [5, 8]. Although the OZI disconnected diagram considered in Refs. [5, 8] is similar to our Fig. 1(b),\nour consideration of the V \u03b3\u2217P coupling will allow us to include both OZI and isospin violation effects\nwhich can be constrained by experimental data.\nWe introduce a typical effective Lagrangian for the V \u03b3P coupling:\nLV \u03b3P =\ngV \u03b3P\nMV\n\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\n\u00b5V \u03bd\u2202\u03b1A\u03b2P (2)\nwhere V \u03bd(= \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6, J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\u2032 . . .) and A\u03b2 are the vector meson and EM field, respectively; MV is the\nvector meson mass; \u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is the anti-symmetric Levi-Civita tensor.\nThe V \u03b3\u2217 coupling is described by the VMD model,\nLV \u03b3 =\n\u2211\nV\neM2V\nfV\nV\u00b5A\n\u00b5 , (3)\nwhere eM2V \/fV is a direct photon-vector-meson coupling in Feynman diagram language, and the isospin\n1 and 0 component of the EM field are both included.\nThe invariant transition amplitude for V1 \u2192 \u03b3\n\u2217 \u2192 V2P can thus be expressed as:\nM \u2261 MA +MB +MC\n=\n(\ne\nfV 2\ngV 1\u03b3P\nMV 1\nFa +\ne\nfV 1\ngV 2\u03b3P\nMV 2\nFb +\ne2\nfV 1fV 2\ngP\u03b3\u03b3\nMP\nFc\n)\n\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\n\u00b5V \u03bd1 \u2202\n\u03b1V \u03b22 P (4)\nwhere gP\u03b3\u03b3 is the coupling for the neutral pseudoscalar meson decay to two photons; Fa and Fb denote the\nform factor corrections to the V \u03b3\u2217P vertices in comparison with the real photon transition for V \u2192 \u03b3P ;\nand Fc is the form factor for P \u2192 \u03b3\n\u2217\u03b3\u2217.\nThe partial decay width can thus be expressed as\n\u0393(V1 \u2192 V2P ) =\n|pv2|\n8\u03c0M2V 1\n1\n2S + 1\n\u2211\n|M|2\n3=\n|pv2|\n3\n12\u03c0\n(\ne\nfV 2\ngV 1\u03b3P\nMV 1\nFa +\ne\nfV 1\ngV 2\u03b3P\nMV 2\nFb +\ne2\nfV 1fV 2\ngP\u03b3\u03b3\nMP\nFc\n)2\n, (5)\nwhere S = 1 is the spin of the initial vector meson; |pv2| is the three-momentum of the final state vector\nmeson in the initial-vector-meson-rest frame.\nThose three typical coupling constants are determined as follows:\n(I) For V \u2192 \u03b3P decay, following the effective Lagrangian of Eq. (2), we derive the coupling constant:\ngV \u03b3P =\n[\n12\u03c0M2V \u0393\nexp(V \u2192 \u03b3P )\n|p\u03b3 |3\n]1\/2\n, (6)\nwhere |p\u03b3 | is the three-momentum of the photon in the initial vector meson rest frame; \u0393\nexp(V \u2192 \u03b3P )\nis the vector meson radiative decay partial width, and available in experiment.\nFor \u03c1\u03b3\u03b7\u2032 and \u03c9\u03b3\u03b7\u2032 couplings, we determine the coupling constants in \u03b7\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c1 and \u03b3\u03c9:\ngV \u03b3\u03b7\u2032 =\n[\n4\u03c0M2V \u0393\nexp(\u03b7\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3V )\n|p\u2032\u03b3 |\n3\n]1\/2\n, (7)\nwhere |p\u2032\u03b3 | is the three-momentum of the photon in the \u03b7\n\u2032 rest frame.\n(II) The V \u03b3\u2217 coupling is determined in V \u2192 e+e\u2212 channel. With the partial decay width \u0393V\u2192e+e\u2212 ,\nthe coupling constant e\/fV can be derived:\ne\nfV\n=\n[\n3\u0393V\u2192e+e\u2212\n4\u03b1e|pe|\n]1\/2\n, (8)\nwhere we have neglected the mass of the electron and |pe| is the electron three-momentum in the vector\nmeson rest frame; \u03b1e = 1\/137 is the fine-structure constant.\n(III) For P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, we adopt the following form of effective Lagrangian:\nLP\u03b3\u03b3 =\ngP\u03b3\u03b3\nMP\n\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\n\u00b5A\u03bd\u2202\u03b1A\u03b2P , (9)\nwhere the coupling constant is normalized to the pseudoscalar meson mass MP . With the partial decay\nwidth \u0393exp(P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) the coupling constant for real photon in the final state can be derived:\ngP\u03b3\u03b3 = [32\u03c0\u0393\nexp(P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)\/MP ]\n1\/2 . (10)\nIt is encouraging that for all the decay channels of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P , the experimental data are\navailable for determining the above coupling constants: gV \u03b3P , e\/fV , and gP\u03b3\u03b3 [1]. We are then left with\nthe only uncertainty from the form factors due to the exchange of off-shell photons.\nWe find that without form factors, i.e. Fa = Fb = Fc = 1, the calculated branching ratios for the\nisospin violated channels will be significantly overestimated. This is expected due to the large virtual-\nities of the off-shell photons and the consequent power suppressions from the pQCD hadronic helicity-\nconservation [2]. Since we think that the non-perturbative QCD effects might have played a role in the\ntransitions at J\/\u03c8 energy1, e.g. in Fig. 1(a) and (b) a pair of quarks may be created from vacuum as\ndescribed by 3P0 model, the pQCD hadronic helicity-conservation due to the vector nature of gluon is\nviolated quite strongly, thus alternatively, we would like to suggest a monopole-like (MP) form factor\ndedicated to the suppression effects:\nF(q2) =\n1\n1\u2212 q2\/\u039b2\n, (11)\n1 For instance such as in the inclusive decay J\/\u03c8 \u2192 qq\u00af, the \u2018virtualness\u2019 of one quark in the created quark pair is less\nthan chiral broken energy scale \u039b\u03c7 \u223c 1.0 GeV, thus, the non-perturbative QCD effects must be sizeable in the concerned\ndecays here.\n4where \u039b can be regarded as an effective mass accounting for the overall effects from possible resonance\npoles and scattering terms in the time-like kinematic region, and will be determined by fitting the data [1]\nfor J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03c1\u03b7, \u03c1\u03b7\u2032, \u03c9\u03c00, and \u03c6\u03c00.\nIt should be noted that this MP form factor can only partly depict the pQCD power suppression due\nto violations of the hadronic helicity conservation when q2 \u226b \u039b2 [2], but it is quite consistent with the\nVMD framework.\nBy adopting the MP empirical form factor, we have already assumed that non-perturbative effects\nmight have played a substantial role in the transitions. In principle it should be tested experimentally\nvia measuring the coupling the processes J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 Pe+e\u2212 and e+e\u2212 \u2192 Pe+e\u2212, respectively, when the\nintegrated luminosity at J\/\u03c8 and the suitable energies for e+e\u2212 colliders is accumulated enough.\nThe form factor Fc appearing in Eqs. (4) and (5) can be determined in \u03b3\n\u2217\u03b3\u2217 scatterings. A commonly\nadopted form factor is\nFc(q\n2\n1 , q\n2\n2) =\n1\n(1 \u2212 q21\/\u039b\n2)(1 \u2212 q22\/\u039b\n2)\n, (12)\nwhere q21 = M\n2\nV 1 and q\n2\n2 = M\n2\nV 2 are the squared four-momenta carried by the time-like photons. We\nassume that the \u039b is the same as in Eq. (11), thus, Fc = FaFb.\nProceeding to the numerical calculations, we first determine the coupling constants, e\/fV , gV \u03b3P and\ngP\u03b3\u03b3 in the corresponding decays, and the results are listed in Tables I-III. It shows that the e\/f\u03c1 coupling\nis the largest one while all the others are compatible. For the gV \u03b3P , it is sizeable for light vector mesons\nand much smaller for J\/\u03c8 and \u03c8\u2032. Note that there is no datum for \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c0 available. So we simply put\ng\u03c8\u2032\u03b3pi = 0 in the calculations. The P\u03b3\u03b3 couplings can be well determined due to the good shape of the\ndata [1].\nTo examine the role played by the form factors, we first calculate the EM decay branching ratios\nwithout form factors, i.e. F(q2) = 1. It shows that all the data are significantly overestimated by the\ntheoretical predictions as shown by Tables IV and V. Nonetheless, it shows that without form factors\nprocess (b) is the only dominant transition.\nTo determine the effective mass \u039b in the MP form factor, we consider two possible relative phases\nbetween process (a) and (b) in fitting the data for the isospin violated channels, J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7, \u03c1\u03b7\u2032,\nand \u03c9\u03c0. We mention in advance that the contributions from process (c) will bring only few percent\ncorrections to the results. Since the corrections are within the datum uncertainties, we are not bothered\nto consider its relative phase to process (a) and (b). In Tables IV and V, the results for process (a) and\n(b) in a constructive phase (MP-C) with \u039b = 0.616 \u00b1 0.008 GeV, and in a destructive phase (MP-D)\nwith \u039b = 0.65\u00b1 0.01 GeV are listed. The reduced \u03c72 values are \u03c72 = 4.1 in MP-C and 14.2 in MP-D,\nrespectively.\nWith the above fitted values for \u039b (MP-C and MP-D), predictions for those isospin conserved channels\nin J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P and \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P are listed in Table IV and V to compare with the experimental\ndata [1].\nThere arise some basic issues from the theoretical results.\n(I) We find that even though with the form factors, process (b) in Fig. 1 is still the dominant one in most\nchannels except for \u03c1\u03b7\u2032. For most channels the couplings gJ\/\u03c8\u03b3P and g\u03c8\u2032\u03b3P in process (a) are generally\nsmall, and similarly are e2\/(fV 1fV 2) and gP\u03b3\u03b3 in process (c). However, we find that the amplitudes of\nprocess (a) and (b) are compatible in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7\u2032. As shown in Table IV, large cancellations appear in the\nbranching ratio when (a) and (b) are in a destructive phase (Column MP-D). This is due to the relatively\nlarge branching ratios for J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7\u2032 [1]. Such a large difference between these two phases makes the \u03c1\u03b7\u2032\nchannel extremely interesting. The branching ratio fraction will be useful for distinguishing the relative\nphases between (a) and (b) in the isospin violated channels. It also highlights the empirical aspect of the\npQCD \u201c12% rule\u201d in exclusive hadronic decays.\nWe also note that process (a) and (c) do not contribute to K\u2217K\u00af+ c.c. and \u03c1+\u03c0\u2212+ c.c. This turns to be\nan advantage for understanding the decay mechanism of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032)\u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 \u03c1+\u03c0\u2212 + c.c. and K\u2217K\u00af + c.c.,\nand should be also an ideal place to test the \u201c12% rule\u201d in exclusive decays.\nTo be more specific, we analyze first those four isospin violation decays: J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b7, \u03c1\u03b7\u2032,\n\u03c9\u03c00 and \u03c6\u03c00. These decays to leading order are through EM transitions. Transitions of Fig. 1 have\nshown how the kinematic and form-factor corrections can correlate with the naive pQCD expected ratio:\n\u0393(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 e+e\u2212)\/\u0393(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 e+e\u2212), i.e. the \u201c12% rule\u201d, and makes it very empirical.\n5As an example, for those channels dominated by process (b), the exclusive decays are still approximately\nproportional to the charmonium wavefunction at its origin, i.e. |\u03c8(0)|2, by neglecting the contributions\nfrom process (a) and (c). The branching ratio fraction can be expressed as:\nRV P \u2261\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P )\nBR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P )\n\u2243\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 e+e\u2212)\nBR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 e+e\u2212)\n|pe|\n|p\u2032e|\n|p\u2032v2|\n3\n|pv2|3\nF2b (M\n2\n\u03c8\u2032)\nF2b (M\n2\nJ\/\u03c8)\n, (13)\nwhere |pe| and |p\n\u2032\ne| are three-momenta of the electron in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 e\n+e\u2212 and \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 e+e\u2212 in the vector\nmeson rest frame, respectively; while |pv2| and |p\n\u2032\nv2| are three momenta of the final state vector mesons\nin J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V2P and \u03c8\n\u2032 \u2192 V2P , respectively. It shows that the respect of the \u201c12% rule\u201d requires that\nthe kinematic and form factor corrections cancel each other for all those channels, which however, is not\na necessary consequence of the physics at all. Including the contributions from process (a) and (c) will\nworsen the situation.\nTo see this more clearly, we list the branching ratio fractions for the choice of MP-C (RV P3 ), MP-D\n(RV P2 ) and without form factors (R\nV P\n1 ) in Table VI to compare with the data. It shows that without the\nform factor corrections, ratio RV P1 has values in a range of (19 \u223c 21)% for those four channels, which are\nlarger than the expectation of the \u201c12% rule\u201d.\nWith the form factors, it shows that RV P3 has a stable range of (7 \u223c 9)%, while more drastic changes\noccur to RV P2 . For instance, we obtain R\n\u03c1pi\n2 = 52% which strongly violates the \u201c12% rule\u201d. Unfortunately,\nthe data still have large uncertainties. We expect that an improved branching ratio fraction for this\nchannel will be able to determine the relative phase between process (a) and (b) in our model, and\nhighlight the underlying mechanism.\nThe branching ratios for \u03c6\u03c00 channel are much smaller than others due to the small \u03c6\u03b3\u03c0 coupling.\nThis is in a good agreement with the OZI rule suppressions expected in \u03c6\u03c00 channel.\n(III) For the isospin conserved channels, the EM decay contributions in J\/\u03c8 decays turn out to be\nrather small in both MP-D and MP-C phases. This is consistent with studies in the literature that\nJ\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P is dominated by the 3g transitions. Thus, the deviation of the \u201c12% rule\u201d could be more\nlikely due to the suppression of the amplitudes in \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 V P (see the review of Ref. [18]).\nIf we simply apply the relations between the strong and EM transitions parametrized by Ref. [21], the\nratio between charged and neutral channels can be expressed as:\nQ \u2261\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 K\u2217+K\u2212 + c.c.)\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 K\u22170K\u00af0 + c.c.)\n\u2243\n[g(1\u2212 s) + e]2\n[g(1\u2212 s)\u2212 2e]2\n, (14)\nwhere g and e denote the strong and EM decay strengths, respectively, and s \u2243 0.1 is a parameter for\nthe flavor SU(3) breaking. One can see that for e = (\u22121\/3 \u223c \u22121\/2)\u00d7 g(1\u2212 s), we have Q \u2243 0.06 \u223c 0.16,\nwhich is in a good agreement with the data, 0.08 \u223c 0.28 [1].\nWe can also check the other two correlated relations:\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 K\u2217+K\u2212 + c.c.)\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 K\u2217+K\u2212 + c.c.)\n\u2243\ne2\n[g(1\u2212 s) + e]2\n\u2243 0.25 \u223c 1, (15)\ncorresponding to e = (\u22121\/3 \u223c \u22121\/2)\u00d7 g(1 \u2212 s). This is consistent with the range of BRMPC \/BR\nexp \u2243\n0.22 \u223c 0.56 and BRMPD \/BR\nexp \u2243 0.28 \u223c 0.70.\nSimilarly, for \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 K\u22170K\u00af0 + c.c. we have\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 K\u22170K\u00af0 + c.c.)\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 K\u22170K\u00af0 + c.c.)\n\u2243\n4e2\n[g(1\u2212 s)\u2212 2e]2\n\u2243 0.16 \u223c 0.44, (16)\ncorresponding to the same range for e (e = (\u22121\/3 \u223c \u22121\/2)\u00d7 g(1 \u2212 s)). It also turns to be compatible\nwith BRMPC \/BR\nexp \u2243 0.10 \u223c 0.15 and BRMPD \/BR\nexp \u2243 0.12 \u223c 0.18.\nFor \u03c1\u03c0 channel, the above relative phase between the strong and EM transitions can explain the\nrelatively small branching ratios for \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0, i.e. the EM amplitude will destructively interfere will the\nstrong one. With e = (\u22121\/3 \u223c \u22121\/2)g(1\u2212 s) \u2243 (\u22121\/3 \u223c \u22121\/2)g [21], we have a relation:\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0)\nBR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0)\n\u2243\ne2\n(g + e)2\n= 0.25 \u223c 1, (17)\n6which is also consistent with BRMPC \/BR\nexp = 0.18 \u223c 0.39 and BRMPD \/BR\nexp = 0.22 \u223c 0.49 [1].\nThe above analysis suggests that the relative phase between the EM and strong transition amplitudes in\n\u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 favors 180\u25e6. But due to the large uncertainties with the data, other phases may be possible [24].\nEvidently, for those channels of which the branching ratio fractions between \u03c8\u2032 and J\/\u03c8 are observed\nto deviate from the \u201c12% rule\u201d (see Table VI), such as \u03c1\u03c0 and K\u2217K\u00af + c.c., they turn to have sizeable\nEM contributions as shown by Tables IV and V. Since the J\/\u03c8 decays are still dominated by the strong\ntransitions, the measured branching ratio fractions mostly reflect the interfered effects in \u03c8\u2032 decays over\nthe strong transitions in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V P .\nWe also analyze EM decay contributions to \u03c8(3770) \u2192 V P , and find they becomes negligibly small\ndue to the small partial width for \u03c8(3770)\u2192 e+e\u2212 and form factor suppressions. In most channels, the\nEM transitions contribute to the branching ratios at O(10\u22128) or even smaller, which is beyond the access\nof the present experimental facilities. Therefore, we can conclude that for those measured \u03c8(3770)\u2192 V P\nchannels the isospin violations must be negligibly small.\nThis approach can also be applied to the study of the EM decay contributions to \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 and \u03c9\u03c0.\nFor the isospin violated \u03c9\u03c00 channel, with the same form factor (MP-C), we find BR(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c00) =\n1.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 and BR(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0) = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 in contrast with the the experimental data, BRexp(\u03c6 \u2192\n\u03c9\u03c00) =\n(\n5.2\n+1.3\n\u22121.1\n)\n\u00d7 10\u22125 and BRexp(\u03c6\u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 + \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c00) = (15.3\u00b1 0.4)% [1]. Note that \u03c6 and \u03c9 are\nquite close in mass, the results should be sensitive to the form factors, and more elaborate treatment for\nthem are generally required. If we slightly adjust \u039b, we can reproduce the data for \u03c9\u03c00 well. For \u03c1\u03c0\nchannel the EM contributions are found much smaller than the data which suggests the dominance of\nstrong decays in \u03c6\u2192 \u03c1\u03c0.\nIn summary, we make a systematic analysis of the EM decay contributions to J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 \u2192 V P\nessentially in a VMD model. With the constraint from the available independent experimental data, the\nEM contributions in all the V P hadronic channels can be consistently investigated. Our results are in a\ngood agreement with the data for those isospin violated channels such as \u03c1\u03b7, \u03c1\u03b7\u2032, \u03c9\u03c0, and \u03c6\u03c0, especially\nfor the \u2018MP-C\u2019 model (see Tables IV,V and VI). For most of those isospin conserved channels, we find\nthat the EM decay contributions can bring sizeable corrections to the \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 V P , which could be a major\nsource accounting for the branching ratio fraction deviations between the V P exclusive decays of J\/\u03c8\nand \u03c8\u2032. Large difference between the data for \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 K\u22170K\u00af0+ c.c. and K\u2217+K\u2212+ c.c. [1] has shown such a\npossibility. An improved measurement of these two channels will be able to clarify the predominant role\nplayed by the EM transitions.\nFor the \u03c1\u03c0 channel, we find that the EM decay contributions in \u03c8\u2032 decays is compatible with the\nexperimental data. This highlights that the interferences from the EM transitions can play essential\nrole in the decay transitions, especially, in the understanding of the abnormally small ratio of BR(\u03c8\u2032 \u2192\n\u03c1\u03c0)\/BR(J\/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0). However, it should be pointed out that the compatible strength of the EM decay\ncontributions with the experimental data in \u03c8\u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 may reflect the suppressed strong decay strength. In\nthis sense, a full understanding of the small branching ratio fraction in \u03c1\u03c0 channel will require a coherent\nstudy of the strong decay mechanisms [10, 15, 16]. This is beyond the focus of this work and should be\npursued in further studies.\nFinally, we note that a full constraint on this model can be reached by accommodating experimental\nmeasurements of J\/\u03c8(\u03c8\u2032) \u2192 Pe+e\u2212 and e+e\u2212 \u2192 Pe+e\u2212 to derive the couplings for gV1\u03b3P and gV2\u03b3P\nfrom which the form factor information can be derived. Ambiguities from the empirical form factors can\nthus be minimized. Experimental analysis of these processes at BES is thus strongly recommended.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors thank C.Z. Yuan, B.S.
