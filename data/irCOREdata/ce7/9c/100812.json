INTRODUCTION\nQUANTUM-DOT (QD)-based optoelectronic devices havebeen intensively studied in recent years. The reason for\nthe interest in this type of device lies in the numerous\nhighly desirable and promising properties that result from the\nspecific physical properties of the dots, e.g., their discrete en-\nergy levels. In particular, these are high differential gain and\nlow laser threshold current [1], low alpha factor [2], and ultra-\nfast modulation properties [3]. Today, real-world QD-based op-\ntoelectronic devices have shown very low threshold current den-\nsities [4], low alpha factors [5], high gain over a large bandwidth\n[6], and 10-GHz direct modulation of a QD-based laser [7]\u2013[8].\nAll in all, the field is reaching an advanced state.\nThis paper presents the first comparison of measured ultrafast\ngain\/absorption dynamics with detailed theoretical analysis of\ncalculations based on spatially resolved QD Maxwell\u2013Bloch\nequations that take into account the waveguiding structure, the\nspatial dependence and microscopic coupling between light\nand carriers as well as relaxation via carrier-carrier and car-\nrier\u2013phonon scattering. Furthermore this comparison is carried\nout on self-assembled InAs\u2013InGaAs\u2013GaAs QDs emitting near\nManuscript received February 8, 2005; revised May 13, 2005.

The\nexperimental studies have been performed with a pump-probe\nsetup with heterodyne detection.\nII. EXPERIMENT AND SAMPLE DETAILS\nExperimental characterization of ultrafast properties of a QD\nSOA was carried out using a degenerate pump-probe experi-\nment with heterodyne detection [9]. The laser source consists\nof a Ti:sapphire oscillator, regenerative amplifier, and optical\nparametric amplifier in cascade and provides transform limited\npulses with 150-ps full-width half-maximum (FWHM) duration\nand tuneable wavelength in the 950\u20132000 nm range. The hetero-\ndyne detection allows simultaneous measurement of the probe\u2019s\namplitude and phase which in turn reflect the SOAs gain and\nindex of refraction. These two quantities yield complementary\ninformation: the gain is a measurement of the population inver-\nsion at the probed energy while the index is related to the off-res-\nonant gain profile through the Kramers\u2013Kronig relations.\nThe sample under investigation is a ridge-waveguide semi-\nconductor optical amplifier (SOA) with an active layer of\nfive sheets of self-organized InAs dots overgrown with 5 nm\nIn Ga As [10]. Each dot layer is separated by a GaAs\nspacer layer of 30 nm thickness and has a QD density of\n4 10 cm . Ridge width is 7 m and length is 2 mm. The\nfacets are uncoated but have a 7 degree angle to reduce feed-\nback and hence inhibit lasing. Insertion loss of this device was\nmeasured to be 18 dB and this loss is mainly due to in- and\noutcoupling losses. The reason for this high coupling loss is due\nto a highly asymmetric mode profile in the far field. Amplified\nspontaneous emission (ASE) spectra [see Fig. 1(a)] from these\ndeeply confining dots show a ground-state emission centered\non 1260 nm with an inhomogeneous broadening of 96 meV\nand an excited-state emission centered on 1190 nm appearing\nat high injection current. The ground state confinement energy\nis 290 meV. The SOA gain for different input pulse energies\nand bias currents is shown in Fig. 2 for a pulse wavelength of\n1235 nm. The pulse energies are measured before incoupling\nto the waveguide. In the linear regime we see a gain ranging\nfrom about 13 dB at zero bias to 4 dB at injection of 25 mA\ncurrent. As pulse energy increases, we see a saturation of the\namplifier leading to bleaching of the absorption and decrease of\nthe gain. At even higher input energies two-photon absorption\n(TPA) drives the gain downward for all bias currents. It is seen\nfrom Fig. 2 that transparency at this wavelength is between 15\nand 20 mA. The dots have a pyramidal shape, with typical base\nlength of 14 nm [10]. Details on the electronic structure of this\nkind of QD have been calculated by Stier et al. [11] and are\n0018-9197\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:04 from IEEE Xplore.

THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION\nIn the following, we summarize the mesoscopic theoretical\ndescription [12] that is used for the numerical modeling of the\nultrafast gain and index dynamics in QD lasers. The spatially re-\nsolved QD Maxwell\u2013Bloch equations mesoscopically describe\nthe spatiotemporal light field and inter\/intra-level carrier dy-\nnamics in each dot of a typical QD ensemble in QD lasers.\nIn particular, this includes the influence of material properties\n(dot size, level energies, dot distribution), spontaneous lumines-\ncence, counterpropagation of amplified spontaneous emission\nand induced recombination as well as carrier diffusion in the\nwetting layer of the QD laser. Intradot scattering via emission\nand absorption of phonons, as well as the scattering with the car-\nriers and phonons of the surrounding wetting layer are dynam-\nically included on a mesoscopic level [12]. Spatial fluctuations\nin size and energy levels of the QDs and irregularities in the\nspatial distribution of the QDs in the active layer are simulated\nFig. 3. (a) Measured and (b) calculated gain change during amplification\nof a short pulse at 1273 nm for an injected current density 0 (solid line),\n86 A\/cm (dashed line), and 571 A\/cm (dotted line). (c) 1=e recovery times\nfrom bi-exponential fit to the gain recovery as function of current density.\n(d) Calculated gain change at 1273 nm and current density of 571 A\/cm with\nboth phonon and Auger contributions (solid line), phonon-only contribution\n(dashed), and Auger-only contribution (dotted). The modeled QD energy level\nscheme is shown schematically as an inset in (b). The electron and hole states\nare labeled e1-3 and h1-5, respectively, from the most confined state to the\nleast confined state.\nvia statistical methods. The spatial fluctuations are modeled in\nthe form where denotes the av-\nerage value and is the spatially dependent fluctuation that\nis simulated with a Gaussian distribution. This leads to spatially\ndependent energy corrections and damping rates. The material\nproperties of the QD ensemble matrix are considered via effec-\ntive parameters [11]. The energies of the electrons are 180, 100,\nand 85 meV; the energies of the holes are 110, 90, 75, 70, and\n55 meV relative to the conduction band and valence band edges\nin the wetting layer, respectively. The inset of Fig. 3(b) shows\nthese levels schematically. The time-dependent calculation of\nthe carrier and light field dynamics allow for explicit consid-\neration of the individual time scales of the various interaction\nprocesses. The relevant time scales range from the femtosecond\nregime (for the fast carrier scattering processes) up to the pi-\ncosecond and nanosecond regime (for the dynamics of the prop-\nagating light fields and of the spatial carrier density).\nThe QD Maxwell Bloch equations consist of QD semicon-\nductor Bloch equations (for the carrier dynamics in each QD), a\ndiffusion equation for the carriers in the embedding material and\na wave equation for the counterpropagating light fields. The QD\nsemiconductor Bloch equations describe the dynamic changes\nof the electron ( , level index ) and hole ( , level index )\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The scattering rates for carrier\u2013phonon intradot re-\nlaxation generally include emission (\u201c \u201d) and absorption (\u201c \u201d)\nof longitudinal acoustical (LA) phonons, longitudinal optical\n(LO) phonons and multiphonon processes ( 2 LO, 2 LA, and\nLO LA). They can be derived on the basis of quantum ki-\nnetic equations of motion for the single particle density matrices\nwith respect to the carrier phonon Hamiltonian [12]. The ma-\ntrix elements for the respective carrier\u2013phonon interactions as\nwell as the scattering rates for Auger processes are calculated\naccording to the derivations in [13]\u2013[15]. Elastic Coulomb scat-\ntering processes between the QDs and the wetting layer leading\nto dynamic shifts in line shapes an emission frequencies are\ntreated on the basis of perturbation theory [16], [17]. The gen-\neration rates given by\ndepend on the interlevel polarization and on the optical field\ncontributions of spontaneous and induced emission constituting\nthe local field .

The interlevel polarization depends via\n( is the frequency of the prop-\nagating light fields) on the carrier energies.\nThe dynamics of the carriers in the wetting layer can be de-\nscribed by the following diffusion equation\n(2)\nwith a pump term describing carrier injection and a rate for non-\nradiative emission processes.\nThe QD semiconductor Bloch equations including the dy-\nnamic intradot scattering and the interactions with the wetting\nlayer constitute a fundamental basis for a microscopic analysis\nand interpretation of the relevant physical processes such as dy-\nnamic carrier excitation and relaxation. At each location in the\nactive dot medium the carrier dynamics is linked (via the gener-\nation rate and the dipole dynamics) to the light field dynamics.\nThe dynamics of the counterpropagating light fields is\ndescribed by [12]\n(3)\nThe Langevin noise term considers spontaneous light field\nfluctuations. The polarization of the active semiconductor\nmedium is the source of\nthe optical fields ( denotes the normalization volume of the\ncrystal).\nIn the following, we will present numerical and experimental\nresults on the propagation of an ultrashort (150 fs) pulse in a QD\namplifier. We will focus on ultrafast dynamics (Section IV), in-\nfluence of dot properties (Section V) as well as on the amplitude\nphase coupling (Section VI). In the theory, the optical injection\nof a light pulse is realized via the boundary conditions of the\nlight fields at the facets.\nIV. ULTRAFAST DYNAMICS\nOn a microscopic level, QDs show very complex carrier\ndynamics. Depending on the material system and the phys-\nical properties of the individual dots, a hierarchy of carrier\nscattering processes via emission and absorption of phonons,\nmultiphonon processes as well as Auger processes may occur.\nIn our pump-probe experiment the pump-induced change in\nthe SOAs gain and index is measured at the exit facet at the\npump-probe energy. This measurement can be simulated by\nappropriate spatial and energetical integration.\nA.

The pump energy of 20 pJ is close\nto the saturation input energy (see Fig. 2) while the two or-\nders of magnitude weaker probe is in the linear regime. For\nour analysis of the gain dynamics, we have subtracted the TPA\ncontribution (occurring when pump and probe arrive simulta-\nneously) from the pump-probe signal. The TPA contribution is\nestimated by measuring gain compression at transparency cur-\nrent since no net stimulated emission or absorption occur in\nthat case. Depending on carrier injection, the pump pulse is\nabsorbed and probe pulse transmission is increased due to ab-\nsorption bleaching (corresponding to positive values in Fig. 3)\nor the pump pulse is amplified and the probe pulse transmis-\nsion is reduced due to gain compression (corresponding to neg-\native values in Fig. 3) thereby dynamically \u2018shaping\u2019 the avail-\nable gain via the nonlinear light-matter coupling. The theoretical\ngain recovery curves [Fig. 3(b)] are derived from the (spatially\naveraged) microscopic distribution of the dipole density that is\ndynamically calculated within the framework of the QD Bloch\nequations. The level scheme of the three electron and five hole\nstates in the modeled QDs is indicated in Fig. 3(b). The imag-\ninary part of the interlevel polarization is directly correlated to\nthe carrier-induced spatiospectral gain the signal pulse experi-\nences during its propagation. The results of the computational\nmodeling and the measurement are in good agreement and re-\nveal the underlying physical processes which will be detailed in\nthe following.\nAt zero bias current, the absorption bleaching that is ob-\nserved, is characterized by an initial subps decay of small\namplitude followed by a slower decay with a decay time of\n40 ps. The fast component originates from the ultrafast re-\nlaxation of the initial nonthermal carrier distribution toward\na quasi-equilibrium state defined by the energetic level sepa-\nration of the ground and excited levels and the corresponding\nphononassisted level-dynamics. The second, longer time is a\ncombination of carrier lifetime and carrier escape from the\ndot. The amplification regime is characterized by a strong\ncarrier depletion at the probed energy levels. This \u201clevel hole\nburning\u201d leads to a large pump-induced gain compression. In\norder to analyze the individual influence of phonon and Auger\nprocesses, we have performed additional simulations where\nwe reduced the scattering terms in the QD Bloch equations to\neither phonon scattering or Auger processes only [Fig. 3(d)].\nThe results clearly demonstrated that for the given QD system\nthe specific shape of the gain dynamics is mostly determined by\nphonon interactions. The Auger contribution is comparatively\nsmall, e.g., one third of the phonon contribution (depending on\ninjection current density). However, Auger processes do play\na role and additionally modify the gain shape. The intradot\nscattering (primarily via emission and absorption of phonons)\nof the gain typically occurs on timescales of a few hundred\nfemtoseconds up to a few picoseconds leading to a fast partial\nrecovery of the gain. The temporal regime after approximately\n1 ps is characterized by a comparatively slow re-establishment\nof the inversion via carrier capture due to phonon scattering.\nA phononmediated carrier capture time on the order of 4 ps\nis consistent with the calculations of Magnusdottir et al. [18]\nand is further supported experimentally by the capture time\u2019s\nweak dependence of injected carrier density in the gain regime\nas shown in Fig. 3(c).\nFig. 4. (a) Measured and (b) calculated gain change during amplification of a\nshort pulse at 1216 nm (solid line), 1250 nm (dashed line), and 1270 nm (dotted\nline) for an injected current density of 570 A\/cm2. (c) Measured (solid line) and\ncalculated (dotted line) gain changes near transparency (1216 nm) shown on an\nenlarged scale.\nB. Spectral Dependence of Gain Dynamics\nFig. 4(a) shows experimental results on the dynamics of the\ngain for three different pump-probe wavelengths and at a con-\nstant injected current density of 570 A\/cm . The pulse wave-\nlength determines the \u201cspectral overlap\u201d and, consequently, the\ncoupling to the level energies of the QD device. For this con-\nstant carrier injection level, the QD-device is in the amplifi-\ncation regime at 1270 nm (corresponding to 8.1 times trans-\nparency current) and approaches transparency when the pulse\nwavelength is reduced (in the example: 3.0 times transparency\nat 1216 nm). The time-resolved measurement and calculation of\nthe pulse-induced gain dynamics allow the fundamental anal-\nysis of the selective depletion and refilling of QD energy levels.\nIt thus directly reveals the influence of material properties such\nas the level energies of the dots and the coupling to the em-\nbedding material on the optical response of the QD laser. Near\ntransparency, the partial exchange of inversion via absorption\nand emission of phonons leads to characteristic modulations\nin the gain dynamics that are directly correlated to the corre-\nsponding increased oscillations in level populations within the\ncharge carrier ensemble of the QDs [see Fig. 4(c)]. The modula-\ntion depth and period thereby depends on the energy separation\nof the levels as well as on injection current and input power.\nThe specific shape of the pulse-induced gain dynamics, as\nwell as the various time scales of the gain recovery, are the fin-\ngerprints of a complex carrier-dynamics in the charge carrier\nensemble in the dots. To elucidate this point we present numer-\nical results on the level dynamics which\u2014via the dependence\nof the intradot polarization on the level occupations\u2014represent\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In the QD Maxwell\u2013Bloch equations the inter- and in-\ntralevel dynamics are automatically represented and calculated\nfor each (electron and hole) energy level. The calculation of the\ncarrier distributions allows visualization of the microscopic in-\nteractions occurring within the dots. As an example, Fig. 5 vi-\nsualizes the dynamics of the hole level occupation in the QDs\n(spatially averaged at the SOAs output facet and normalized to\nthe occupation before the passage of the pulse) during the pas-\nsage of the light pulse. The respective electron level occupations\nshow a qualitatively similar behavior. Fig. 5(a) corresponds to\nthe amplification regime (wavelength of the injected light pulse:\n1270 nm) and Fig. 5(b) to the near-transparency regime (wave-\nlength of the injected light pulse: 1216 nm), respectively. The\npump pulse leads to an optical excitation of the carrier system\nand to a selective level-hole burning [e.g., Fig. 5(a)]. Depending\non the dipole matrix elements for the individual states and de-\npending on the frequency detuning of the pulse with respect\nto the frequency of the respective electron and hole transition\na reduction of the individual level occupation and a partial re-\nfilling via carrier injection and microscopic scattering processes\noccurs. The microscopic scattering processes involved in this\n\u201clevel hole burning\u201d are determined by emission and absorption\nof phonons, multiphonon interactions and the interaction with\nthe carriers and phonons of the wetting layer. The magnitude of\nthe various \u201cchannels\u201d for relaxation mechanisms thereby de-\npend on the QD energy levels, on the energy difference to the\nsurrounding layers and on the coupling of a dot to its next neigh-\nbors. The dot-to-medium and dot-to-dot interactions thereby are\ndetermined by the dot density and the light fields that meso-\nscopically couple the QDs during their propagation. In partic-\nular, the dynamic occupation of a dot level is via carrier and\nphonon scattering influenced by the neighboring levels. A level\nenergy spacing close to the LO phonon energy leads to a reso-\nnance-like exchange of occupation between neighboring levels.\nFig. 6. (a) Measured and (b) calculated phase change during amplification of a\nshort pulse at 1273 nm for an injected current density of 0 (solid line), 86 A\/cm\n(dashed line), and 571 A\/cm (dotted line).\nDue to the dependence of the interlevel polarization on the car-\nrier dynamics this dynamic carrier exchange directly affects the\ngain dynamics. This dynamic carrier exchange and level dy-\nnamics then leads to characteristic modulations that are particu-\nlarly visible near transparency [Fig. 4(c)]. This behavior is most\npronounced when the energy difference between the dot levels\nis near the LO phonon energy as is the case for our dots. More\ndeeply confined dots with level separations much larger than this\nvalue would not display this behavior but show decoupled level\ndynamics and selective level hole burning instead as it can be\nseen in Fig. 5(c). As a consequence, the degree of coupling be-\ntween the individual levels also affects the saturation behavior\nof a QD laser waveguide that has been optically injected with\na light pulse. For the same characteristics of an injected light\npulse (i.e., input power, duration, pulse shape), a QD-medium\nwith decoupled level energies (i.e., energy separation larger than\nthe LO phonon energy) will show a stronger saturation behavior\nthan a QD ensemble with a strong coupling of the level energies\nwhere a mutual exchange of level occupations via scattering and\nrelaxation dynamics occurs.\nC. Phase Dynamics\nThe pulse-induced changes in the carrier distributions\nare\u2014via the Bloch equations\u2014directly reflected to changes in\nthe polarization [see (1)]. Gain and phase changes, in turn, can\nbe derived from the dynamics of the interlevel polarization. The\nmeasurement and calculation of the phase change thus provides\ncomplementary information to the gain dynamics. The hetero-\ndyne detection scheme in the pump-probe setup allows for the\nsimultaneous measurement of the pump-induced change in the\ngain and phase of the probe pulse. Fig. 6(a) shows [for the same\nsituation as in Fig. 3(a)] the measured phase dynamics. The\nresults of the numerical simulation are displayed in Fig. 6(b).\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:04 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\n1120 IEEE JOURNAL OF QUANTUM ELECTRONICS, VOL. 41, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2005\nDepending on injection current density, the pulse induces a\ncharacteristic rise or decrease in the phase followed by an ultra-\nfast partial recovery on a time scale of less than one picosecond.\nIn the gain regime where the QD sample is inverted, the level\nhole-burning leads to a reduction of the carrier distributions and\nconsequently to a rise in the induced refractive index. Imme-\ndiately after the pulse the partial refilling of the dot levels (via\ncarrier\u2013phonon interactions) and the coupling to carriers of the\nwetting layer states leads to a decrease in the refractive index.\nIn combination with the gain dynamics (compare Fig. 3) this\nleads to a pulse-induced maximum in the phase dynamics. Ac-\ncording to the relation the resulting decrease and\nincrease in the instantaneous frequency within the pulse enve-\nlope can be interpreted as dynamic deceleration and acceleration\nof the propagating light fields. Near transparency, the dynami-\ncally varying pulse amplitude causes both induced recombina-\ntion processes and carrier accumulation due to absorption. The\nresulting phase dynamics may thus show both, positive and neg-\native values. For low injection current densities (i.e., absorption\nregime), the pulse is absorbed thereby exciting the charge carrier\nplasma in the dots. As a consequence, the pulse-induced phase\nis negative. In all current regimes, the phase dynamics immedi-\nately after the ultrafast recovery is determined by the long time\nbehavior of the carrier distributions, gain and induced index,\ni.e., the (comparatively slow) filling of the dots via the injec-\ntion current.\nV. INFLUENCE OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES: DEEP\nAND SHALLOW DOTS\nNext to the energy structure of the individual dot it is, in par-\nticular the energetic coupling to the environment that affects the\nultrashort time dynamics of a QD ensemble. As an example we\nwill in the following consider the dynamics of the pulse-induced\ngain for deep and shallow dots.\nFig. 7 visualizes the gain dynamics for deep (grey)\nand shallow (black) QDs in the gain regime (current den-\nsity: 600 A\/cm ). Typical values for the energy structure of\ndeep and shallow dots (leading to energy confinements of\napproximately 300 and 100 meV, respectively) have been taken\nfrom literature [19], [20]. The shallow dots are characterized\nby a small energy difference between dot states and states of\nthe embedding material. Capture via Auger processes are in\ngeneral found to be decreasing with increasing dot confinement\nand capture via phonon scattering is a rapidly changing function\nof dot size [18]. As a consequence, the gain shows a quick\nrelaxation that is primarily determined by the ultrafast intradot\ncarrier relaxation. The ultrafast spectroscopy on shallow dots\nreported by Borri et al. [19] and Akiyama et al. [21] did show\na faster overall gain recovery in qualitative agreement with our\ncalculation. In the QD ensemble consisting of deep dots the\nlarger energy difference between dot levels and environment\nleads to a higher complexity in the involved scattering processes\n(carrier\u2013carrier, carrier\u2013phonon and multiphonon interactions).\nThus, the gain dynamics is characterized by both the ultrafast\nintradot scattering that determines the shape and duration of the\ninitial peak and a subsequent slow gain recovery due to carrier\ninjection and the interaction between dots and wetting layers.\nFig. 7. Calculated gain change during the passage of a GS resonant light pulse\nfor deep and shallow dots.\nVI. INFLUENCE OF CARRIER INJECTION ON\nAMPLITUDE PHASE COUPLING\nDue to their discrete level energies, QDs have a rather sym-\nmetric gain and induced index dispersion. In principle, they\nshould thus have a small coupling of change in gain and re-\nfractive index when the carrier density is varied [22]. This\ncoupling is usually quantified in the alpha factor, , which is\nequivalently defined in terms of the optical susceptibility or\nand\n(4)\nwhere is the light\u2019s wave number. Indeed, values near one\ncould be found for InGaAs\u2013GaAs QD lasers in experiments\n[5]. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the alpha factor\nin QD lasers is much lower and shows less spectral dispersion\nthan in quantum-well lasers of identical material and geometry\n[23]. Despite the unique electronic properties of individual dots,\na variety of different alpha factors arise in real ensembles of\nQDs. This originates from the pulse-induced nonequilibrium\ndynamics and the complex interplay of carrier excitation and\nrelaxation, involving various carrier\u2013phonon and multiphonon\nprocesses with their individual time scales. Furthermore, the\nspatially inhomogeneous dot distribution that typically exists in\nreal QD devices leads to a spatial variation in shape and ampli-\ntude of the gain, index and phase dynamics. As a consequence,\nthe measured value of the (spatially and temporally averaged)\nmay be large even though the \u201clocal\u201d value may be very small\nfor a given time step. This effect is particularly pronounced in\nQD devices with a large width of the active waveguide. As an\nexample, Fig. 8(a) shows the calculated for a QD waveguide\nwith a cavity width of 50 m at the central ground state (GS)\nemission wavelength as function of current injection for an ideal\ndot system with negligible fluctuations in dot electronic proper-\nties and a real dot device with typical dot-to-dot variations (4%\nfluctuations in dot parameters). In the structure with identical\ndots, the strong Coulomb interactions induce a shift in the char-\nacteristic distributions of gain and index [24].

(a) Theoretical alpha factor at the GS emission wavelength of 1260 nm\nfor a ridge width of 50 \u0016m for two different distributions of QD properties\n(see text for explanation). (b) Comparison of experimental and theoretical alpha\nfactor of 7 \u0016m ridge width SOA at GS emission wavelength.\nthe alpha factor decreases with current and may even become\nnegative at high currents. In a spatially inhomogeneous dot en-\nsemble the Coulomb-induced shift in gain and index is masked\nby the large inhomogeneous broadening which results in a rise\nin alpha with carrier density.\nThe alpha factor of the actual SOA (ridge width: 7 m)\nwas measured at the GS emission wavelength of 1260 nm as a\nfunction of injected current. The measurement was performed\nby applying small, rapid variations in the injected current\nwhile monitoring the heterodyne signal. The corresponding\ngain and index changes in the sample then lead to the gener-\nation of alpha-dependent sidebands in the heterodyne signal.\nThe magnitude of alpha was extracted from an analysis of\nthe relative height of these sidebands [25]. Thermal effects\nin the waveguide were eliminated by performing the current\nvariations at a 1-MHz speed. The measured alpha values and\nthe results of a corresponding numerical simulation of the QD\ndevice are summarized in Fig. 8(b). Theory and experiment\nshow a good agreement. The large inhomogeneous linewidth\nof the sample results in an increase in alpha with increasing\ncurrent. We would like to note that the rise in alpha is small,\nstarting from almost zero to approximately 1.3 at three times\ntransparency current. Due to the small ridge width the influence\nof the lateral degree of freedom is much smaller than in a\nSOA with larger ridge width. As a consequence, the influence\nof fluctuations is decreased and the dependence on injection\ncurrent is comparatively small.\nA dynamical alpha factor can be inferred from the measured\nand calculated gain and phase dynamics (Figs. 3 and 6) and is\nshown in Fig. 9 for the case of zero bias current. The alpha factor\ndynamics is related to the redistribution of the resonantly in-\njected carriers. In both the experiment and calculation a rapid\nincrease in alpha is seen in the first 20 ps. After this time the dy-\nnamical alpha parameter is constant or only slowly increasing.\nThe slow increase in the measured dynamical alpha factor after\n20 ps reflects slightly different recovery times of the gain and\nphase. This is not reproduced in the theory which has the same\nFig. 9. Dynamical alpha factor at zero current and at GS central emission\nwavelength of 1260 nm.\nultimate gain and phase recovery time. The reason for this dis-\ncrepancy is not well understood. When measuring the alpha\nfactor using optical carrier modulation rather than electrical car-\nrier modulation a higher value is found [25], [26]. This differ-\nence is related to the very different circumstances under which\nthe carrier density is modulated.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nWe have presented joint experimental and numerical results\non the ultrafast gain and index dynamics in QD amplifiers.\nOur simulations are based on spatiotemporally resolved\nQD Maxwell\u2013Bloch equations that take into account light\ndiffraction, intradot carrier scattering as well as the dynamic\ninteraction between dot carriers and carriers in the embed-\nding material. The strong spatial and temporal variance in\nthe dynamic nonlinear light-matter coupling and saturation\neffects occuring during the propagation of a light pulse requires\nthe inclusion of the full spatial ad temporal dependence of\nthe complex light field and carrier dynamics. Comparison of\nexperimental pump-probe traces and the model shows that for\ntypical geometries and spatially inhomogeneous dot properties\nthe QD Maxwell\u2013Bloch equations do give a realistic simulation\nof the various carrier scattering processes such as emission and\nabsorption of phonons that are responsible for the complex gain\ndynamics. At small injection currents, the large level separation\nprevents the injected carriers from diffusing and consequently\na long relaxation time of 40 ps, related to carrier lifetime,\nis dominating the absorption recovery. In the gain regime,\nhowever, ultrafast, subps phonon scattering is responsible for\na dominating contribution to the gain recovery. The remaining\ngain recovery, happening on a few picoseconds timescale, is\nrelated to carrier capture from the wetting layer. The phase\nrecovery at all currents shows a much slower recovery deter-\nmined by the restoration of carrier density via the injection\ncurrent. Gain dynamics is strongly dependent on dot energy\nlevel structure and comparison of the experimental data on deep\ndots presented in this paper with data on shallow dots presented\nin literature [19], [21] shows a faster gain recovery for shallow\ndots. This behavior is reproduced by our calculations.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:04 from IEEE Xplore.
