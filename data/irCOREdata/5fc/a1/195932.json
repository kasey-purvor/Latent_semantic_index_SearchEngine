The \ninhibition of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in glucose \ndeprived cells by the over-expression of \ndominant-negative PERK or an N-terminal \ntruncation mutant of GADD34 leads to a 53% \nincrease in the rate of total protein synthesis. \nPolysome analysis revealed that this coincides \nwith an increase in the amplitude but not the \nnumber of ribosomes per mRNA, indicating \nthat eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation mobilises \nhitherto untranslated mRNAs onto \npolysomes. In summary, we show that PERK \nis activated at low glucose in response to a \ndecrease in energy status and that this plays \nan important role in glucose regulated protein \nsynthesis in pancreatic \u03b2-cells.  \n \nIntroduction. \nGlucose stimulated insulin secretion from \npancreatic \u03b2-cells is mediated by a series of steps \ninitiated by the metabolism of glucose, which \nresults in an increase in the cellular ATP\/ADP \nratio. This increase in the ATP\/ADP ratio causes \nthe closure of ATP sensitive potassium channels, \nleading to membrane depolarisation and the \nsubsequent opening of L-type voltage gated \ncalcium channels (VGCC). The resultant influx \nof calcium activates the exocytotic machinery, \nresulting in the secretion of insulin (for review \nsee [1]). Glucose also stimulates a rapid increase \nin the rate of proinsulin synthesis (up to 20-fold \nwithin 1h), the co-ordinate increase in the rate of \nsynthesis of a large subset of proteins and a two-\nfold increase in the rate of total protein synthesis \n[2-11]. These acute changes in the rate of protein \nsynthesis are almost entirely regulated at the \npost-transcriptional level [2-11] and, like insulin \nsecretion, require the metabolism of glucose \n[12]. However, the metabolic signals emanating \nfrom the mitochondrial metabolism of glucose \nthat stimulate secretion are distinct from those \nthat stimulate protein synthesis [12, 13].  \nAn important rate limiting step in protein \nsynthesis is the assembly of the translational \nternary complex, made up of the methionyl \ninitiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi) attached to \neukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) in its GTP \nbound state (eIF2-GTP:Met-tRNAi) (for review \nsee [14]). This ternary complex binds to the 40S \nribosomal subunit which, in association with \nadditional initiation factors, delivers the Met-\ntRNAi to the mRNA translational start site. \nFollowing translational start site recognition, the \nGTP bound to eIF2 is hydrolysed to GDP, \nrendering eIF2\u03b1 unable to bind initiator \nmethionyl tRNA. Therefore, in order to take part \nin further rounds of initiation, eIF2-GDP must be \nrecycled back to eIF2-GTP. The \u2018recycling\u2019 of \n 2\neIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP is catalysed by the \nguanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) \neIF2B. Since active eIF2-GTP is required for the \nrecruitment of Met-tRNAi, changes in the \nactivity of eIF2B are important in regulating the \nrate of translation initiation [15]. eIF2B activity \nis regulated by a number of mechanisms \nincluding phosphorylation of its \u03b5-subunit by \nGSK3 [16, 17], allosteric regulation [18, 19], \nand competitive inhibition by phosphorylation of \nthe alpha subunit of its substrate eIF2 (eIF2\u03b1) on \nSerine 51  [20, 21]. Competitive inhibition of \neIF2B by phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 is the most \nstudied and best characterised mechanism by \nwhich eIF2B activity is regulated.   \neIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation occurs in response to a \nwide array of cellular stresses mediated by one \nof four eIF2\u03b1 kinases: the double stranded RNA-\ndependent eIF2\u03b1 kinase (PKR), the mammalian \northologue of the yeast GCN2 protein kinase \n(mGCN2), the heme-regulated eIF2\u03b1 kinase \n(HRI) and the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum \nkinase (PERK). PKR expression is induced by \ninterferon and is activated in response to dsRNA \n[22, 23]. In yeast, GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 \nin response to uncharged tRNAs (amino acid \ndeprivation) and glucose starvation [14, 24, 25]. \nHowever, the role of the mammalian orthologue \n(mGCN2) is less clear. HRI is activated in \nresponse to heme-deprivation in erythroid cells \n[26] and PERK is activated in response to \nprotein malfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum \n(ER) as part of the unfolded protein response \n(UPR) [27-29]. It has been speculated that the \nUPR may be activated in response to high \nglucose concentration due to increased rates of \nprotein synthesis exceeding the folding capacity \nof the ER and resulting in the accumulation of \nunfolded proteins and the activation of PERK \n[27, 30-32].  \nWe have previously demonstrated, in islets of \nLangerhans and in the pancreatic \u03b2-cell line \nMIN6, that the availability of the translational \nternary complex is increased in response to \nglucose [11] and that this was likely mediated \nthrough the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. In \nMIN6 cells, changes in both the availability of \nternary complex and the phosphorylation status \nof eIF2\u03b1 paralleled changes in protein synthesis, \nleading us to hypothesise that eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation is likely to play a key role in \nglucose stimulated protein synthesis [11]. \nMoreover, in MIN6 cells, increases in eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation in response to a temporally \nacute decrease in glucose concentration parallel \nthe recruitment of mRNAs encoding integrated \nstress response genes onto polysomes [33]. \nRecently, it has been reported that, in MIN6 \ncells, eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation in response to \nincreasing glucose concentrations is mediated, at \nleast in part, by an increase in PP1 activity \ntowards eIF2\u03b1 [34]. However, the eIF2\u03b1 kinase \nthat phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 at low glucose \nconcentration in pancreatic \u03b2-cells and its role in \nglucose regulated protein synthesis is unknown.  \n \nMaterials and Methods. \n 3\nChemicals and Materials. DMEM was obtained \nfrom Sigma. Foetal calf serum was purchased \nfrom Invitrogen. [35S]-methionine was obtained \nfrom MP Biomedicals UK. All other chemicals \nwere purchased from Sigma unless otherwise \nstated. \n \nCell Culture and Treatment. In this study, MIN6 \ncells (kindly provided by Prof. Jun-Ichi \nMiyazaki) were used between passages 25-40 at \n~80% confluence. MIN6 cells were grown in \nDMEM containing 25mM glucose supplemented \nwith 15% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, \n100\u03bcg\/ml streptomycin, 100 units\/ml penicillin \nsulfate, 75\u03bcM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and 40mM \nsodium bicarbonate, equilibrated with 5% CO2, \n95% air at 37\u00b0C. Prior to treatment, the medium \nwas removed and the cells were washed twice \nwith Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) \n(115mM NaCl, 5mM KCl, 10mM NaHCO3, \n2.5mM MgCl2, 2.5mM CaCl2, 20mM HEPES \npH 7.4 supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum \nalbumin (BSA)). The cells were then incubated \nfor 1h at 37\u00b0C in KRB (unless otherwise stated) \nprior to incubation in KRB or KRB containing \n20mM glucose for a further hour at 37\u00b0C (unless \notherwise stated). Full details of treatments are \nprovided in the figure legends. After treatment, \nthe cells were washed with ice cold PBS and \nthen lysed by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer \ncontaining 1% triton, 10mM \u03b2-\nglycerophosphate, 50mM tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1mM \nEDTA, 1mM EGTA, 1mM sodium \northovanadate, 1mM benzamidine-HCl, 0.2mM \nphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 \u03bcg\/ml each of \nleupeptin and pepstatin, 0.1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol \nand 50mM sodium fluoride (unless otherwise \nstated). The lysates were then centrifuged for \n10min at 16000 g. The supernatants were kept \nand total protein concentrations were determined \nby the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as \nstandard. The protein lysates were stored at \u2013\n80\u00b0C until further analysis.  \n \nDetermination of Cellular ATP content. ATP \ncontent was determined using a bioluminescent \nassay (Sigma) following the manufacturer\u2019s \ninstructions. Briefly, following treatments, as \ndescribed above and in the figure legends, cells \nwere lysed by the addition of somatic cell ATP \nreleasing reagent. Luminescence was then read \nimmediately in a Novostar (BMG Labtech) 96 \nwell plate reader with injectors.  \n \nAdenoviral construction and Infection. \nRecombinant adenoviruses expressing amino \nacids 1-583 of PERK (i.e. dominant negative \nPERK (Ad-PERK\u0394C)) and GFP (Ad-empty) \nhave been previously described [11]. In order to \ngenerate pAdTrack-GADD\u0394N, GADD34 cDNA \nwas amplified by PCR from a mouse cDNA \nlibrary generated from MIN6 cells using the \nprimers GADD34-N-F721 5\u2019 AGC GAA TTC \nTCT AGA GAG AAG CCT AAG 3\u2019 and \nGADD34R-UTR 5\u2019 TAT CTC GAG GGA AAC \nTAC TCA GGC TTA GCC 3\u2019. The resultant \ncDNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and \nsubcloned into EcoRI and XhoI digested pCMV-\n 4\nTag3b creating pCMV-Tag-GADD\u0394N, encoding \nthe C-terminal end of GADD34 fused in frame \nwith an N-terminal myc epitope tag. Myc-tagged \nGADD\u0394N was amplified by PCR using primers \nGADD34-FMYC 5\u2019AGC GGT ACC ATG GAG \nCAG AAA CTC ATC 3\u2019 and GADD34R-3UTR \n5\u2019TAT CTC GAG GGA AAC TAC TCA GGC \nTTA GCC 3\u2019. The PCR product was digested \nwith KpnI and XhoI and subcloned into KpnI and \nXhoI digested pAdTrack-CMV. The resulting \nplasmid pAd-GADD\u0394N was used to generate the \nrecombinant adenovirus Ad-GADD\u0394N as \npreviously described [11]. For infection, MIN6 \ncells were incubated in the presence of the virus \nfor 48h prior to treatments [11]. Under these \nconditions, >90% of cells were infected, as \ndetermined by EGFP expression using \nfluorescence microscopy.  \n \nSilencing of PERK Expression Using Small \nInterfering RNAs. PERK expression was \nspecifically silenced in MIN6 cells using 25 \nnucleotide prevalidated siRNA duplexes (Stealth \nTM Select RNAi) purchased from Invitrogen \ndirected against mouse PERK (siRNA20-Sense \n5\u2019UAGAGGAGUUCAAACAGAAUCAAGC3\u2019\n- antisense \n5\u2019CGUUGAUUCUGUUUGAACUCCUCUA3\u2019 \nand siRNA21-Sense \n5\u2019UCUUUGAACCAUCAUAUGCUCUUGGG\n3\u2019- antisense \n5\u2019CCCAAGAGCAUAUGAUGGUUCAAGA3\u2019\n). An siRNA, which showed no significant \nhomology to any known protein was used as a \ncontrol (Con siRNA- Sense \n5\u2019CGUGAUUGCGAGACUCUGATT3\u2019- \nantisense 5\u2019UCAGAGUCUCGCAAUCACGTT \n3\u2019). SiRNAs were introduced into MIN6 cells by \nelectroporation using a pipette-type \nelectroporator (Microporator MP-100 from \nDigital Bio). Transfections were performed \naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. \nTypically, transfection >90% were obtained as \nassessed by monitoring the transfection \nefficiency of a fluorescent siRNA (Block-itTM \nfluorescent oligo from Invitrogen).  \n \nProtein Synthesis Measurements. Protein \nsynthesis measurements were performed \nessentially as described previously [35]. Briefly, \ncells were incubated in the presence of [35S]-\nmethionine for the times indicated in the text. \nCell lysates (as described in Cell Culture and \nTreatment) were prepared and equal amounts of \nprotein (about 20\u03bcg) were spotted onto 3MM \nWhatmann filters. The filters were then washed \nby boiling them for 1 min in 5% trichloroacetic \nacid containing 0.1g\/litre of methionine. This \nwas repeated three times. The filters were then \ndried and immersed in scintillant before \ndetermining radioactivity by scintillation \ncounting. \n \nSDS-PAGE and Western Blotting. SDS-PAGE \nand Western blotting were performed as \ndescribed previously [35]. Anti-phospho eIF2\u03b1 \n(Ser-51) antibody was purchased from \nBiosource. Anti-phospho AMP-activated kinase \n 5\n(AMPK) (Thr-172) was purchased from Cell \nSignalling Technologies, MA, USA. Anti-IRE1 \nand anti-phospho IRE1 (Ser724) were purchased \nfrom Novus Biologicals Inc, CO, USA. Anti-\nPERK antibody was kindly provided by Prof. \nRonald Wek (Indiana University School of \nMedicine, USA) and anti-eIF2\u03b1 antibody was a \ngenerous gift from Prof. Chris Proud (Columbia \nUniversity, Vancouver, Canada) \n \nPCR-Based Assay for XBP-1 Splicing. After \ntreatments, as described in the figure legend, \ntotal RNA was prepared from cells using TRI \nreagent (Sigma) and first-strand cDNA were \nsynthesized from 4 \u03bcg of each sample using \nSuperScriptTMII Reverse Transcriptase \n(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s \ninstructions. xbp-1 processing is characterised by \nexcision of a 26bp sequence from the coding \nregion of xbp-1 mRNA [36]. Thus the cDNA \nprepared were used as template for PCR using \nprimers flanking the splice site, as described by \nMarciniak et al. [37]. Unspliced xbp-1 gave a \nproduct of 480bp, and the spliced cDNA was \n454bp. The cleaved 26bp fragment contains a \nPst1 restriction site, and so the extent of xbp-1 \nprocessing can be evaluated by restriction \nanalysis [38]. PCR products were purified and \ndigested with Pst1 restriction enzyme. \nRestriction digests were separated on 3% \nagarose gel containing ethidium bromide. PCR \nproducts derived from unspliced xbp-1 mRNA \n(indicating absence of ER stress) were digested \nin two bands of 290bp and 190bp. In contrast, \nproducts amplified from spliced xbp-1 mRNA \nwere resistant to digestion and remained 454bp \nlong, indicating presence of ER stress. \n \nPolysome profile Analysis. After treatment, cells \nwere lysed in polysome buffer (20mM HEPES \npH  7.6, 15mM MgCl2, 300mM KCl, 1  mg\/ml \nheparin, 0.1mg\/ml cycloheximide, 1  mM DTT, \n1\u03bcl\/ml RNAguardTM, 1mM benzamidine-HCl, \n0.1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1  \u03bcg\/ml \nleupeptin and 1  \u03bcg\/ml pepstatin) supplemented \nwith 1% triton. Cell lysates were centrifuged for \n10  min at 13000g at 4\u00b0C to remove nuclei and \ncell debris. The supernatants were then layered \nonto 20-50% sucrose gradients (made in \npolysome buffer) and centrifuged at 39000rpm \nfor 2h at 4\u00b0C in a Sorvall TH64.1 rotor. The \ngradients were fractionated using an ISCO \ngradient fractionator that continuously measured \nabsorbance at 254nm.  \n \nResults \nPERK is activated upon glucose deprivation. To \ninvestigate whether the eIF2\u03b1 kinase PERK is \nactivated by glucose deprivation, MIN6 cells \nwere mock infected or infected with a \nrecombinant adenovirus over-expressing a \ndominant-negative mutant of PERK \n(AdPERK\u0394C). 48h post-infection, the cells were \nincubated in KRB without glucose or containing \n20mM glucose in the presence or absence of \nthapsigargin (an ER stress inducing agent known \nto lead to the activation of PERK) as a positive \ncontrol. The activation of PERK was assessed by \n 6\nits migration on SDS-PAGE using antisera \nagainst total PERK (Fig. 1a). In the mock \ninfected cells, glucose deprivation and \nthapsigargin treatment resulted in a decrease in \nPERK mobility on SDS-PAGE, consistent with \nPERK phosphorylation, and an increase in the \nphosphorylation of its substrate eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 1a). \nThe over-expression of PERK\u0394C inhibited \nPERK's mobility shift and eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation induced in response to glucose \ndeprivation and thapsigargin. These results \ndemonstrate that PERK is activated upon \nglucose deprivation and that PERK activation is \nprimarily responsible for eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation \nin glucose deprived cells. To provide additional \nevidence that PERK is responsible for the \nphosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 in response to glucose \ndeprivation, the expression of PERK was \nknocked-down in MIN6 cells using two distinct \nsets of siRNAs. The expression of PERK was \nreduced by up to 80% which resulted in a 41-\n45% and a 34-41% reduction in eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation in response to either glucose \ndeprivation or thapsigargin treatment \nrespectively (Fig. 1b). Taken together these \nresults provide good evidence that PERK \nphosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 in glucose deprived MIN6 \ncells. \nTo determine whether these PERK-dependent \nincreases in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in response \nto glucose deprivation also occur at \nphysiologically relevant glucose concentrations, \nMIN6 cells were mock infected or infected with \nthe recombinant adenovirus AdPERK\u0394C and \nincubated in KRB containing 0, 2, 5, 7.8, 10, 20 \nor 40mM glucose and, as a positive control, \nthapsigargin (Fig. 1c). In mock infected cells, the \nphosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 increased with \ndecreasing glucose concentrations. Importantly, \nthe expression of PERK\u0394C inhibited the \nphosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 1c) at all glucose \nconcentrations tested. This provides evidence \nthat PERK is activated in response to \nphysiologically relevant decreases in glucose \nconcentrations.  \nWe had previously reported that PERK was \nunlikely to be responsible for the \nphosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at low glucose \nconcentration [11]. This conclusion was \nprimarily based on results showing that, at low \nglucose concentration, PERK was not \nsignificantly phosphorylated at Thr980. \nHowever, it is likely that the anti-phospho PERK \nThr980 antibody used in our previous study was \nnot sensitive enough to consistently detect \nchanges in PERK phosphorylation at low \nglucose concentrations. \n \nDecreases in Intracellular Energy Status \nactivate PERK. Given that protein folding is an \nenergy dependent process, one possible effector \nof PERK activation is a fall in the energy status \nof the cell in response to a decrease in glucose \nconcentration. To investigate this possibility, we \ninitially determined whether mitochondrial \ninhibitors of the electron transport chain could \nactivate PERK and stimulate the \nphosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 2). Treatment of \n 7\nMIN6 with three distinct mitochondrial \ninhibitors of the electron transport chain \n(Rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I; sodium \nazide, an inhibitor of complex IV; and \noligomycin, which blocks the F0 proton channel \nof ATP synthase) all led to the phosphorylation \nof PERK and the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. \n2a). All inhibitors had similar effects on \nintracellular ATP content, reducing ATP to less \nthan 1\/6 of that of the control (Fig. 2b). \nTherefore, a decrease in the energy status of \nMIN6 cells can stimulate the activation of PERK \nand the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. To investigate \nwhether physiological decreases in energy status \nalso lead to the activation of PERK and eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation, we artificially reduced cellular \nATP content and the energy status of the cell to \nwithin the range observed in glucose deprived \ncells using oligomycin (Fig. 3). Increasing \noligomycin concentrations led to a dose-\ndependent decrease in intracellular ATP content \n(Fig. 3a) and the energy status of the cell, as \nassessed by the phosphorylation state of AMP-\nactivated protein kinase (AMPK) (a sensor of \nintracellular AMP and hence cellular energy \nstatus [39] ) (Fig. 3b). Importantly, oligomycin \ninduced decreases in cellular energy status that \nwere within the range seen in glucose deprived \ncells caused similar increases in eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation, which paralleled increases in \nthe phosphorylation of PERK (Fig. 3b and c). \nIncreasing oligomycin concentrations also led to \na dose-dependent decrease in the rate of [35S]-\nmethionine incorporation into protein, relative to \nthe cells incubated at 20mM glucose alone (Fig \n3d). Interestingly, decreases in energy \nstatus\/ATP alone are not solely responsible for \nthe dramatic decrease in the rate of protein \nsynthesis observed in glucose deprived cells as \noligomycin induced decreases in ATP\/energy \nstatus similar to that evoked by glucose \ndeprivation led to a comparatively small \ndecrease in the rate of protein synthesis \ncompared to that evoked by glucose deprivation \n(Fig. 3). \nTo confirm that oligomycin stimulated eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation by activating PERK, MIN6 \ncells were mock infected or infected with a \nrecombinant adenovirus over-expressing a \ndominant-negative mutant of PERK \n(AdPERK\u0394C). 48h post-infection, the cells were \nincubated in KRB or KRB plus 20mM glucose \nin the presence or absence of increasing \nconcentrations of oligomycin (Fig. 3e). In the \nmock infected cells, increasing concentrations of \noligomycin led to a dose-dependent decrease in \nthe mobility of PERK on a SDS-polyacrylamide \ngel, consistent with PERK phosphorylation. This \nphosphorylation of PERK paralleled increases in \nthe phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 3e). Over-\nexpression of PERK\u0394C resulted in an inhibition \nof PERK's phosphorylation in response to all \ndoses of oligomycin tested and in response to \nglucose deprivation. These decreases in PERK \nphosphorylation correlated with a decrease in \neIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3e), demonstrating \nthat oligomycin evokes the phosphorylation of \neIF2\u03b1 via the activation of PERK.  \n 8\n AMPK Activation does not stimulate eIF2\u03b1 \nPhosphorylation or Protein Synthesis in \nPancreatic \u03b2-cells. As the activation of AMPK \nparallels eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (see Fig. 3), we \ninvestigated whether AMPK plays a role in the \nregulation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation or indeed \nglucose regulated protein synthesis. MIN6 cells \nwere pre-incubated for 1h in KRB at 0mM \nglucose before treatment for a further hour at \neither 0mM or 20mM glucose, or 20mM glucose \nin the presence of increasing concentrations of \n5'-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4 \ncarboxamide (AICAR), a pharmacological \nactivator of AMPK (Fig. 4a). As expected, \nglucose deprivation led to a significant increase \nin the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 4a) that \ncorrelated with an increase in AMPK activation, \nas assessed using a phospho-specific antibody to \nThr172 of AMPK. However, when cells were \ntreated with increasing concentrations of \nAICAR, AMPK phosphorylation was not \naccompanied by an increase in eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation (Fig. 4a). Additionally, AICAR \nhad no inhibitory effect on glucose-stimulated \nprotein synthesis (Fig. 4b). These data provides \nevidence that neither changes in eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation nor protein synthesis are \nmediated via changes in the activity of AMPK.  \n \nInvestigation into the Mechanism of PERK \nActivation in Response to Glucose Deprivation. \nTransducers of the unfolded protein response \n(UPR) include two related ER transmembrane \nserine-threonine kinases, PERK and inositol \nrequiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) (an RNAse required \nfor the splicing and activation of the X-box \ntranscription factor XBP1). PERK and IRE1 are \nthought to be activated by a similar mechanism \nrequiring homo-oligomerisation, possibly \ninitiated by the dissociation of  BiP from their \nER luminal domains [28, 40, 41]. As glucose \ndeprivation leads to the activation of PERK, we \ninvestigated whether glucose deprivation also \nresulted in the activation of IRE1 (Fig 5a). \nInitially, we investigated the auto-\nphosphorylation state of IRE1 on Ser724, whose \nphosphorylation is required for IRE1 activation \n(Fig 5ai). MIN6 cells were incubated in KRB or \nDMEM containing 0 or 20mM glucose or treated \nwith thapsigargin as control (Fig 5ai). IRE1 was \nmore phosphorylated on Ser724 in MIN6 cells \nincubated at 20mM glucose compared to that \nseen in glucose deprived cells, indicating that \nIRE1 was possibly inactivated in glucose \ndeprived cells. To assay IRE1 activity, IRE1-\ndependent splicing of its substrate, the XBP1 \nmRNA was determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 5aii). \nIn this case, MIN6 cells were maintained in \ncomplete media or incubated in either KRB \n(0mM glucose), KRB supplemented with 0.5mM \nglucose or KRB supplemented with 20mM \nglucose for 2, 16 and 24h. As a positive control, \ncells were also treated with thapsigargin for 2 or \n4h. As anticipated, treating cells with \nthapsigargin led to a large increase in the spliced \nform of the XBP1 mRNA (Fig. 5aii). The \ntransfer of cells from full media (c) containing \n 9\n25mM glucose to KRB or KRB supplemented \nwith 0.5mM or 20mM glucose led to a decrease \nin the amount of the spliced form of XBP1 (Fig. \n5aii). However, in cells incubated in KRB \nsupplemented with 20mM glucose for 16h and \n24h an increase in the spliced form of XBP1 was \nobserved. Therefore, IRE1 is inactive in glucose \ndeprived cells or cells incubated at low glucose \nconcentrations, whereas IRE1 is activated at \nhigh glucose concentrations. These results are in \nagreement with previous reports investigating \nIRE1 activation in response to differing glucose \nconcentrations in Islets [32]. As IRE1 is not \nactivated by glucose deprivation and PERK is, \nthe mechanism or threshold of activation of \nPERK must differ from that of IRE1.  \nPERK and IRE1 are classically activated by the \naccumulation of unfolded proteins within the \nER, where ER client load exceeds the folding \ncapacity of the ER. Therefore, to investigate \nwhether the accumulation of nascent \nunfolded\/incompletely processed proteins within \nthe ER led to PERK activation under conditions \nof glucose deprivation, MIN6 cells were \nincubated in the presence of cycloheximide for \n1h (preinc) to inhibit protein synthesis and allow \nnascent proteins undergoing processing within \nthe ER to be chased into mature processed \nproteins (Fig. 5b). The cells were then further \nincubated in the presence of cycloheximide for \nan hour in the absence or presence of 20mM \nglucose and the levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation \ncompared to cells in which cycloheximide had \nnot been added. To ascertain whether nascent \nproteins within the ER were fully processed \nduring the 1h preincubation with cycloheximide \nand that cycloheximide had effectively blocked \nfurther protein synthesis, [35S]-methionine was \nadded to the cells 15min prior to the \npreincubation (P) and left on the cells during the \npreincubation period. The incorporation of [35S]-\nmethionine into proinsulin, insulin and total \nprotein was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5bi). \nIn the presence of cycloheximide, no increase in \nprotein synthesis was detected (compare lanes 1 \nto 3). Additionally, the labelled proinsulin was \nno longer detectable after 1h incubation with \ncycloheximide (compare lanes 1 to 3), indicating \nthat the proinsulin had been fully processed to \ninsulin and presumably chased out of the ER\/cell \n(Fig. 5bi). At high glucose concentration, \ncycloheximide reduced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation \n(Fig. 5bii), indicating that ER client load and the \naccumulation of unfolded proteins may \ncontribute to ER stress and the activation of \nPERK as previously predicted [32]. In contrast, \nin the absence of glucose, cycloheximide \ntreatment had no significant effect on eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation (Fig. 5bii). This indicates that \nthe accumulation of unfolded\/unprocessed \nnascent proteins is unlikely to account for the \nactivation of PERK under conditions of glucose \ndeprivation.  \n \nPERK Dependent eIF2\u03b1 Phosphorylation \nContributes to the Suppression of Protein \nSynthesis at Low Glucose. To investigate the role \nof PERK-dependent eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in \n 10\nthe suppression of protein synthesis and \nproinsulin synthesis at low glucose, MIN6 cells \nwere infected with an empty adenovirus (Ad-\nEmpty), a recombinant adenovirus expressing a \ndominant-negative mutant of PERK \n(AdPERK\u0394C) or an N-terminal truncation \nmutant of GADD34 (AdGADD\u0394N) which \nconstitutively directs protein phosphatase-1 to \neIF2\u03b1 leading to eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation. 48h \npost-infection, the cells were incubated in KRB \nwithout glucose or containing 20mM glucose in \nthe presence or absence of thapsigargin as a \npositive control. The phosphorylation state of \nPERK and eIF2\u03b1 were assessed by Western \nblotting (Fig. 6ai). In the control cells infected \nwith Ad-Empty, glucose deprivation and \nthapsigargin treatment resulted in a decrease in \nPERK mobility on SDS-PAGE, consistent with \nPERK phosphorylation. This phosphorylation of \nPERK by either glucose deprivation or \nthapsigargin paralleled increases in the \nphosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and decreases in the \nrate of protein synthesis compared to cells \nincubated in 20mM glucose (Fig. 6ai and ii). \nOver-expression of PERK\u0394C or GADD\u0394N \nsignificantly inhibited eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation \ninduced in response to glucose deprivation and \nthapsigargin treatment (Fig. 6ai) and, as \nexpected, significantly overcame the inhibition \nof protein synthesis induced by thapsigargin \n(Fig. 6aii). Importantly, over-expression of \nPERK\u0394C or GADD\u0394N increased protein \nsynthesis by a mean average of 53% in glucose \ndeprived cells but still only partially overcame \nthe inhibitory effects of glucose deprivation on \nprotein synthesis. The over-expression of \nPERK\u0394C or GADD\u0394N had similar effects on \nthe synthesis of proinsulin, indicating that eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation does not play a specific role in \nglucose regulated proinsulin synthesis (Fig \n6aiii). Analysis of the polysome profiles from \nglucose deprived MIN6 cells over-expressing \nPERK\u0394C or GADD\u0394N demonstrate that the \ninhibition of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation leads to an \nincrease in the amplitude of the polysomes but \nnot in the number of ribosome loaded onto \nmRNA (Fig. 6b). One possible explanation is \nthat the inhibition of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in \nglucose deprived cells stimulates the recruitment \nof otherwise dormant mRNAs into polysomes.  \n \nDiscussion  \nIn this report we present evidence that PERK is \nactivated in pancreatic \u03b2-cells in response to a \ndecrease in glucose concentration. This increase \nin PERK activity is evoked by a decrease in the \nenergy status of the cell through a potentially \nnovel mechanism, independent of the \naccumulation of nascent unfolded proteins \nwithin the ER and the activation of IRE1. We \nalso demonstrate that the phosphorylation of \neIF2\u03b1 at low glucose plays an important role in \nsuppressing global rates of protein synthesis in \npancreatic \u03b2-cells.  \nThe mechanism by which PERK is activated by \ndecreased glucose concentration\/energy status is \nunknown. Yet, it has previously been \nhypothesised that glucose starvation may, \n 11\nthrough a decrease in UDP-NAcHexosamines \nproduction, inhibit protein glycosylation, \nresulting in the accumulation of unprocessed \nproteins within the ER and the activation of \nPERK [42]. Indeed, in a number of cell types, \ntunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation, \nactivates PERK and the UPR [27]. However, the \nmitochondrial metabolism of pyruvate is \nsufficient to stimulate the dephosphorylation of \neIF2\u03b1 in glucose deprived MIN6 cells, via a \nmechanism that is presumably independent of \nthe hexosamine pathway (unpublished \nobservations). Additionally, up to 4h incubation \nof MIN6 cells with tunicamycin is unable to \nstimulate the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 \n(unpublished observations). Another possibility \nis that PERK activation is mediated through the \ninhibition of the proteasome, a high consumer of \nATP, which in turn may lead to the inhibition of \nER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) and \nthe accumulation of unfolded proteins within the \nER. In support of this, proteasome inhibition by \nMG132 stimulates eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [43, \n44], although this has been reported to be via the \nactivation of mGCN2 [43]. Alternatively, energy \nstatus may directly lead to the inhibition of \nprotein folding [45, 46], as BiP binding to \nunfolded proteins is dependent on an ADP\/ATP \ncycle in which cellular ATP is consumed [42]. \nYet we provide evidence that PERK activation \noccurs via a mechanism independent of the \naccumulation of nascent unfolded proteins and \nprocessing intermediates in the ER (Fig 5b). On \nthe other hand, it is possible that PERK is \nactivated by the dynamic folding status of an ER \nresident protein(s), a hypothesis that we \ncurrently favour. However, why PERK \nactivation occurs independently of IRE1 \nactivation in glucose deprived \u03b2-cells remains \nunclear.  \nGlucose causes a rapid increase in the rate of \nprotein synthesis in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, however, \nthe mechanism by which glucose does this is \npoorly understood. The inhibition of eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation stimulates a 53% increase in the \nrate of protein synthesis in glucose deprived \ncells but is unable to restore protein synthesis to \nthe rates seen in glucose replete cells (Fig. 6aii). \nPolysome analysis showed that inhibition of \neIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in glucose deprived cells \nled to an increase in the amplitude of the \npolysomal peaks but not in the size of the \npolysomes. One possible interpretation of these \nresults is that eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation mobilises \nhitherto untranslated mRNAs onto polysomes. \nWe and others have shown that incubation of  \nMIN6 cells\/islets at low glucose concentration \nleads to an increase in the expression of proteins \nassociated with the integrated stress response \n[32, 33], which has been shown in other cell \ntypes to be dependent upon eIF2\u03b1 \nphosphorylation and important in pre-\nconditioning cells in becoming resistant to the \neffects of various cell stresses, including \noxidative stress [27, 29, 47]. Therefore, PERK-\ndependent phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 at low \nglucose may play a role in protecting pancreatic \n\u03b2-cells against oxidative stress mediated by \n 12\nphysiological rapid increases in glucose \nconcentration. \nThe activation of PERK through a decrease in \nthe energy status of the cell is unlikely to be a \nunique feature of the pancreatic \u03b2-cell as \nhypoxia and ischemia\/reperfusion, both \nassociated with decreases in intracellular energy \nstatus, lead to PERK-dependent phosphorylation \nof eIF2\u03b1 in a number of other cell types [48-53]. \n \nFigure Legends \n \nFigure 1: PERK in activated by a decrease in glucose concentration. a.)

The gradients were fractionated from top (fraction 1) to bottom (fraction \n20). Absorbance of the gradients was measured continually at 254nm to give polysome profiles. \n \nReferences \n \n1 Rutter, G. A.
