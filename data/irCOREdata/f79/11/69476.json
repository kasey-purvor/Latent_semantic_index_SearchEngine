The expression \u2018to get hold of the wrong end of the stick\u2019 is a \ncommon idiom in British English. In one context it could be used literally and refer \nto picking up a piece of wood, in another it could be used figuratively to mean a \nmisunderstanding. Children with language difficulties often struggle with idiom \ncomprehension (Kerbel, 1998; Kerbel & Grunwell, 1998). Our focus in this paper is to \nidentify the source of idiom processing difficulties in children with specific reading \ncomprehension difficulties (Cain, Oakhill, & Lemmon, 2005; Levorato, Nesi, & \nCacciari, 2004).  \nIdiomatic expressions are understood in relation to the context in which they \nare used. For most idioms different scenarios could be used to support the literal and \nfigurative interpretations, although not all idioms can support a sensible literal \ninterpretation. As a result, the skills used to process and understand language in \ncontext are thought to be important for the development of idiom understanding \n(Levorato & Cacciari, 1995). Populations who experience difficulties processing \nlanguage in context often have poor idiom understanding (Norbury, 2004) and the \npresence of a supportive context boosts younger and older children\u2019s comprehension \nof idioms (Gibbs, 1987; Nippold & Martin, 1989).  \nWhen an idiom is unfamiliar, it may be (partly) understood by analysis of the \nmeanings of the words in the phrase (Nippold & Taylor, 1995). In the example used \nabove, \u2018wrong\u2019 provides a clue to the figurative meaning. Idioms that have a strong \noverlap between their literal and figurative meanings are generally easier to \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n4 \nunderstand than those that do not (Gibbs, 1991; Nippold & Rudzinski, 1993; Nippold \n& Taylor, 1995). These idioms are commonly referred to as transparent and opaque, \nrespectively. Analysis of the internal semantics of the phrase may aid idiom \ncomprehension, particularly for children and adolescents (Nippold, 1998): children \nand adolescents aged 11, 13, and 17 years find that idioms rated as more familiar and \nmore transparent are easiest to comprehend (assessed with a forced-choice task) \n(Nippold & Taylor, 1995). There is also evidence that adults engage in literal analysis \nof the phrase. They are influenced by the transparency of known idioms, taking \nlonger to read nondecomposable (opaque) idioms than decomposable (transparent) \nitems presented in context (Titone & Connine, 1999). Titone and Connine (1999) \npropose that the longer reading times arise because adults activate both literal and \nfigurative meanings, which are semantically distinct for nondecomposable idioms \nand, therefore, result in a processing cost for the more opaque expressions.  \nThese two strategies, inference from context and semantic analysis (or the \nability to derive alternate meanings of phrases), might aid the acquisition of idiom \nmeanings. Research by Nippold and colleagues indicates that these two strategies \ncontinue to aid the processing of idioms in adolescence. In a forced-choice task, 11-, \n13-, and 17- year-olds showed better understanding for transparent than for opaque \nidioms (e.g., Nippold & Taylor, 1995). When asked to write interpretations of idioms, \n14 to 17-year-olds provided more accurate responses for idioms presented in \nmeaningful contexts than those presented in isolation (Nippold & Martin, 1989). In \nyounger children, the same effects of transparency and context are evident (e.g., \nCacciari & Levorato, 1999) and these two strategies are incorporated into an \ninfluential model that seeks to explain how children\u2019s competence with all forms of \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n5 \nfigurative language develops: the Global Elaboration Model (GEM: Levorato & \nCacciari, 1995).  \nThe essence of the GEM is that the same processes and strategies that children \nuse to understand language in general, underpin the comprehension of figurative \nlanguage. For example, comprehension of both literal and figurative language is \ndependent on understanding individual words and word strings in context; both \ninvolve using inference and integration to make links between parts of a text to \nestablish a coherent meaning. Levorato and Cacciari (1995) have used this model to \nexplain why both children with language difficulties and young children often fail to \nunderstand idioms. They argue that young children and those with language \ndifficulties process language on a local, word-by-word basis, seeking to understand \na piece of text rather than striving for an integrated and coherent meaning of the text \nas a whole (e.g., Levorato & Cacciari, 1995; Levorato, Nesi, & Cacciari, 2004). As a \nresult, young children and those with language difficulties may fail to detect that the \nliteral sense of an idiom does not fit the context, or they may lack the skills to derive \na meaning that is contextually appropriate. To date, the focus has been on the \nbenefits of context, with few studies contrasting transparent and opaque idioms to \ninvestigate semantic analysis. However, in one study that did compare transparent \nand opaque idioms in typically developing children they suggest that the influence \nof context is felt earlier in development than that of semantic analysis (Levorato & \nCacciari, 1999).  \nIn this study we look at idiom comprehension in relation to children\u2019s reading \ncomprehension skills. Reading comprehension may fail for different reasons: for \nexample, children with poor word reading skills may struggle to understand the text \nbecause their slow and inefficient word reading burdens limited processing \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n6 \nresources (e.g., Perfetti, 1985). In this study, we focus on a different group who have \nunexpected reading comprehension difficulties: children who develop age-\nappropriate word reading skills, but have very poor reading (and also listening) \ncomprehension (Cain, Oakhill, & Bryant, 2000a; Stothard & Hulme, 1992). These \nchildren, described by Oakhill (1982), comprise approximately 10% of typically \ndeveloping 8- to 11-year-olds (e.g., Yuill & Oakhill, 1991).  \nPoor reading comprehenders\u2019 language processing difficulties extend to \nmany of the skills essential for adequate text comprehension, such as inference \ngeneration and the use of context to resolve anomalies in text (Cain, Oakhill, Barnes, \n& Bryant, 2001; Oakhill, 1982; Yuill, Oakhill, & Parkin, 1989). Research shows that \nthe population of poor comprehenders is not homogenous: some poor \ncomprehenders have weak semantic or syntactic skills, whilst others show age-\nappropriate performance on such measures (Cain & Oakhill, 2006; Nation, Clarke, & \nMarshall, 2004). A consistent finding is the absence of phonological difficulties \ntypically associated with poor word reading (e.g., Cain, Oakhill, & Bryant, 2000b; \nCatts, Adlof, & Weismer, 2006). Poor comprehenders make an interesting population \nfor the study of idiom processing because they do not have pronounced pragmatic \ndeficits (in contrast to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, e.g., Norbury, 2004) \nand they have developed age-appropriate word reading skills, indicating that they \ndo not have a general learning delay. A greater understanding of their idiom \ncomprehension can shed light not only the source of their idiom processing \ndifficulties, but also on the source of their reading comprehension difficulties.  \nPrevious work has shown that children with reading comprehension \ndifficulties are poor on tasks designed to measure idiom comprehension and \nproduction: they are less likely than same-age good comprehenders to select the \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n7 \ncorrect interpretation in a multiple-choice task (Levorato, Nesi, & Cacciari, 2004) and \nthey are less able to complete correctly a fragment of an idiomatic expression (Nesi, \nLevorato, Roch, & Cacciari, 2006). Both studies found evidence of a literal processing \nstyle: poor comprehenders were more likely to select a literal response and were \nmore likely to provide a literal completion for a fragment (see also Nippold, Moran, \n& Schwarz, 2001, for evidence of the relation between text comprehension and idiom \ninterpretation).  \nIn our own work, we have begun to investigate which processing strategies \nmight underpin the idiom comprehension difficulties of this population. Using an \nexplanation task, we found a relation between reading comprehension and \nunderstanding of idioms, in support of the work by Levorato, Nippold and their \ncolleagues (Cain, Oakhill, & Lemmon, 2005). Cain et al.\u2019s study included novel \nidioms to eliminate confounds of prior knowledge and exposure to the idioms, \nwhich are related to age and language level. It also compared performance on \ntransparent and opaque items. When an unknown idiom is presented in a \nsupportive context, an approximate meaning may be derived from contextual clues. \nFor an unknown opaque idiom, context is the primary source for meaning \nderivation, whereas the meaning of a transparent idiom can (partially) be derived \nthrough semantic analysis as well. A comparison of these two types of idioms \nprovides insight into the use of processing strategies and may help us to understand \nwhy idiom comprehension is deviant or delayed in some children. The good and \npoor comprehenders did not differ in their ability to explain the meanings of novel \ntransparent idioms, in or out of context, but differed significantly in their ability to \nexplain the meanings of novel opaque idioms when presented in a supportive story \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n8 \ncontext. In contrast to Levorato et al.s\u2019 (2004) study, there was no evidence of a literal \nprocessing preference.  \nThe study of children with language comprehension difficulties to date \ndemonstrates the importance of context for idiom comprehension:  poor \ncomprehenders are particularly impaired in their use of context to derive \nappropriate meanings of idiomatic expressions. However, the source of poor \ncomprehenders\u2019 difficulties with idioms remains unclear. Levorato et al.\u2019s work \nindicates that children with comprehension difficulties may be developmentally \ndelayed: the poor comprehenders showed a literal processing preference, similar to \nthat described for young children (e.g., Levorato & Cacciari, 1999). Cain et al.\u2019s study \nindicates that poor comprehenders\u2019 difficulties were specific to use of context: \nperformance on transparent idioms, which can be partially understood through \nsemantic analysis, was not impaired. In this study, we ask: do poor comprehenders \nsuffer from a general lag in the processing strategies used to learn and understand \nidioms (semantic analysis and use of context) or are their problems specific to the \nuse of context?  \nOur research addressed this question in the following ways. We compared \nchildren\u2019s ability to understand idioms that were amenable to semantic analysis with \nthose that were not: hereafter, transparent and opaque. The idioms were presented \nin isolation and also in supportive story contexts to investigate how context aids \nidiom comprehension. We used British English idioms and translations of European \nidioms that did not appear in English idiom dictionaries and were not known to \nadult native-speakers: hereafter, real and novel respectively. Our reason for doing so \nis that the use of real idioms may provide an inaccurate picture of children\u2019s idiom \nprocessing skills because those with better reading comprehension may be more \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n9 \nfamiliar with particular idiomatic phrases (see Nippold & Rudzinski, 1993, for a \ndiscussion of the language experience hypothesis of idiom acquisition). \nAdditionally, the use of novel idioms enables us to address issues related to the \nacquisition of idiomatic meanings, which has an extended period of development \nthat is not completed during adolescence (Nippold & Taylor, 1995).  \nThe participants were 9- and 10-year-old children with age-appropriate word \nreading skills: one group had age appropriate reading comprehension (good \ncomprehenders), the other had a lag in reading comprehension of up to 24 months in \nrelation to both their chronological age and their word reading skill (poor \ncomprehenders). In contrast to the poor comprehenders studied by Nesi and \ncolleagues (Nesi, Levorato, Roch, & Cacciari, 2006), this population\u2019s reading \ncomprehension difficulties do not spontaneously recover, but persist for several \nyears (Cain & Oakhill, 2006). Our work extends our earlier research on this \npopulation\u2019s difficulties with idiom comprehension in two important ways.  \nFirst, we included an independent measure of semantic analysis skills. In this \ntask, children are required to produce (at least) two different meanings for sentences \nwith ambiguous words and grammatical structures. This task involves many of the \nsame skills that can aid the interpretation of an unfamiliar transparent idiomatic \nexpression. To date, there are no published studies comparing idiom comprehension \nto performance on an independent measure of semantic analysis.  \nSecond, we used a multiple-choice task to assess understanding of idioms.  \nCain et al. (2005) used an explanation task to assess idiom comprehension, which \nmay disadvantage children with language difficulties because they are required to \nproduce a verbal response (Spooner, Gathercole, & Baddeley, 2006). Our previous \nwork may have underestimated poor comprehenders\u2019 abilities and a multiple-choice \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n10 \ntask may provide a more sensitive measure of idiom understanding in children with \ncomprehension difficulties.  \nIf the idiom comprehension difficulties of poor comprehenders are truly \ncomprehension difficulties, rather than response production difficulties, the good \ncomprehenders should perform better than the poor comprehenders in general. If \npoor comprehenders\u2019 difficulties are specific to inference from context, they should \ndo particularly poorly on (novel) opaque idioms, but both groups should obtain \ncomparable scores on (novel) transparent idioms and the semantic analysis task. If \nthe poor comprehenders\u2019 difficulties with idioms arise from more widespread \nlanguage processing delays or deficits, e.g., poor semantic analysis skills in addition \nto poor use of context, they should also be poor on the novel transparent idioms and \nobtain lower scores on the independent measure of semantic analysis.  \nMethod \nParticipants \nTwo groups of 9-10-year-olds participated in this study: 15 good comprehenders (7 \ngirls, 8 boys) and 15 poor comprehenders (6 girls, 9 boys). Participants were recruited \nfrom small urban schools with socially mixed catchment areas in the north west of \nEngland. Participants in the experiment were children who spoke British English as \ntheir first language, had no known behavioural problems or learning difficulties, and \nfor whom teacher and parental consent was obtained. The procedures were approved \nby the Departmental ethics committee.  \nTwo tests were used to select participants from an original sample of 169 Year 5 \nchildren (9-10-year-olds): The Gates-MacGinitie Primary Two Vocabulary Test (Level \n4, Form K) (MacGinitie & MacGinitie, 1989), which provides an index of a child\u2019s \nability to read and understand written words out of context, and the Neale Analysis of \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n11 \nReading Ability - Revised British Edition (Form 1) (NARA II: Neale, 1989), which \nprovides scores for word reading accuracy in context and text comprehension. The \nGates-MacGinitie is a group-administered test and the NARA II is individually \nadministered. \nTABLE 1 AROUND HERE \n The group characteristics are reported in Table 1. The good and poor \ncomprehender groups were matched for chronological age t(28) < 1.0, and also for \nperformance on the Gates-MacGinitie vocabulary subtest, t(28) < 1.0. On the NARA-II, \nall of the selected children obtained reading accuracy in context ages that were good \nfor their chronological age, indicated by the mean standardised scores (Ms = 106.9 and \n107.7, for the good and poor comprehenders, respectively). The good comprehenders\u2019 \nreading comprehension ability was slightly above their chronological age and in line \nwith their reading accuracy level (standardised M = 106.1) and the poor \ncomprehenders\u2019 scores were below average for their chronological age (M = 84.4). The \ngood and poor comprehender groups differed significantly with regard to their \nreading comprehension age, as measured by the NARA-II: tage-equivalent(28) = 7.39, p < \n.001; tstandardised(28) = 9.75, p < .001. The good and poor comprehender groups were \nmatched on the NARA-II measure of word reading accuracy, t(28) < 1.0. In this way, \nwe were able to exclude any child whose weak comprehension skills had arisen from \ndifficulties in reading words in continuous prose (NARA-II) or understanding written \nwords (Gates). The two groups were also matched on the number of stories that they \nhad read on the NARA-II, t(28) < 1. The latter measure was necessary to ensure that \nthe difference in comprehension scores did not arise because the poor comprehenders \nhad read fewer stories and, therefore, obtained lower comprehension scores simply \nbecause they had attempted fewer comprehension questions.  \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n12 \nMaterials: construction and evaluation \nTwenty four idioms were used in this study: twelve were common British English \nidioms and twelve were translations of European idioms for which no British \nequivalent was known and were, therefore, considered novel. The interpretations for \nthe British English idioms were taken from The Collins Cobuild Dictionary of Idioms \n(Sinclair, 2002). The European idioms were selected from publications and websites \nlisting idioms in other languages. All appeared in more than once source and were \nchecked with native speakers of these languages (Italian, Spanish and Danish). There \nwere six transparent and six opaque idioms for each set, which had been piloted and \nused in previous research (see Cain et al., 2005, for full details).  \nThe contrast between the transparent and opaque idioms was checked with a \ncomponent rating task, in which adult participants rated the extent to which \nindividual words or groups of words contributed to the meanings of the idiomatic \nexpression (higher scores indicate a greater contribution). The mean ratings for the \nitems used in the current research were: real transparent =3.49, real opaque = 2.55, \nnovel transparent = 3.33, novel opaque = 1.85. The scores obtained for the \ntransparent and opaque idioms for each type (real and novel) differed significantly, \nps < .001. Full details of the selection of these idioms can be found in Cain et al. \n(2005). The full set of idioms is provided in Appendix One.  \n In our original selection work (reported in detail in Cain et al., 2005) we \nobtained \u2018recognition\u2019 scores from our participants. These indicated that the children \nhad not heard the novel transparent or novel opaque idioms before (Ms = .43 and \n.14, out of 6, respectively). The recognition scores were higher for real transparent \nthan for real opaque (Ms =2.5 and 1.6) but the effect of transparency was not \nsignificant. For the current study, we obtained familiarity ratings from 16 native \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n13 \nBritish-English speakers adults for the 24 idioms. We adapted the instructions of \nTitone and Conine (1994) to do so and used a rating scale of 1 to 7, where 7 indicates \n\u2018never seen or heard\u2019 and 1 indicates \u2018frequently seen or heard\u2019. Participants were \ninstructed that variants of idioms existed. They were asked to write down a variant, \nif that was the form of the expression that was familiar to them, to rate the known \nvariant. No variants for novel idioms were reported. The two sets of real idioms \n(transparent and opaque) did not differ in their familiarity ratings, neither did the \ntwo sets of novel idioms: ps > .10, but all other contrasts were significant. Mean \nscores were real transparent = 2.4, real opaque = 2.8, novel transparent = 6.7, novel \nopaque = 6.8.  \nExperimental tasks and procedure \nIdiom comprehension was assessed using a multiple-choice task. Children were \nrequired to choose one out of four interpretations of an idiom: a target idiomatic \ninterpretation of the phrase; a figurative interpretation, which was plausible within \nthe story context; a figurative interpretation, which was not plausible within the \nstory context; an interpretation that provided a literal interpretation of part of the \nphrase. Examples are provided in Table 2. There were six items each for the \nfollowing types: real transparent, real opaque, novel transparent, novel opaque. Pilot \nwork with adults (N=34) established that, in context, the idiomatic interpretation \nwas the most common selection, with the following mean correct scores: real \ntransparent = 5.8; real opaque = 5.7; novel transparent = 5.7; novel opaque = 5.3 \n(maximum possible = 6). \n \nTABLE 2 AROUND HERE \n \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n14 \nIdioms in isolation. Children were tested individually in a quiet room away \nfrom the classroom. The work was completed in a booklet. The instructions for the \ntask were printed on the front cover of the test booklet and read out to the child: \u201cIn \nthis booklet there are a number of short expressions or sayings, for example \u2018it\u2019s \nraining cats and dogs\u2019. After each saying there are four possible meanings. Your job \nis to choose the right one.\u201d  An example with four multiple-choice options followed, \nwhich was completed by each child in their booklet with help from the experimenter \nand feedback as necessary. An example is provided in Table 2. Children were then \ntold: \u201cDon't worry if you haven't heard some of these sayings before, a few of them \nhave been made up. If you\u2019re not sure which one is the right answer, just choose the \none that you think it might be.\u201d The experimenter then worked through the booklet \nwith each child: she read out each item and the four multiple-choice options.  \n Idioms in context. The idioms in context condition was administered a \nminimum of two weeks after the isolation condition, in a similar way. The same \ntwenty-four idioms were used, each was embedded in a supportive story (see Table \n2.) The instructions were adapted to note the story context. The items were \npresented in the same order for each child, distributed so that the same type of \nidiom (real-transparent, real-opaque, novel-transparent, novel-opaque) did not \nappear consecutively. A different order was used for the in isolation and in context \nconditions. The total number of each response option selected was calculated \n(maximum = 6, for each condition).  \nSemantic analysis skills. Children completed an adaptation of the Ambiguous \nSentences subtest from The Test of Language Competence, Expanded Edition (TLC-\nExpanded: (Wiig & Secord, 1989)). This test is developed for American English. \nEleven items were selected from Level 1 and eight from Level 2 on the basis that \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n15 \nthey were common in British English. The Level 1 items comprised a short sentence \nthat could have multiple interpretations, because of a word that could take two or \nmore different meanings, e.g., \u2018This key doesn\u2019t work\u2019. Each sentence was \naccompanied by four pictures, two of which depicted possible meanings. The Level \n2 items comprised a sentence only with no accompanying pictures. The different \nmeanings of these sentences rested on computing a different grammatical structure \nfor the sentence, e.g., \u2018I don\u2019t know about you, but visiting relatives can be a \nnuisance\u2019. The selected items contained common British English words and \ngrammatical structures. The items were scored according to the manual.  \n \nResults \nThe mean sum scores obtained for correct idiomatic choices in isolation and in \ncontext are shown in Table 3.  \nIdioms in isolation. A series of one-sample t tests for each comprehension \ngroup was conducted to determine the likelihood that each group were able to select \nthe correct response by chance with the \u03b1 level set at .00625 (adjusted for the 8 \ncomparisons). Both groups performed comparably: they responded above chance \nlevel on both types of transparent idiom: good comprehenders real, t(14) = 6.58, p < \n.005 and novel, t(14) = 7.91, p < .005; poor comprehenders real, t(14) = 4.19, p < .005 \nand novel, t(14) = 3.52, p < .005. Their performance on both types of opaque idiom \ndid not differ from chance, all ts < 1.71, all ps > .10.  \n \nTABLE 3 AROUND HERE \n \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n16 \nIdioms in context. A series of one-sample t tests for each group demonstrated \nthat all scores were significantly greater than chance (ps < .001).  \nFacilitatory effect of context. The total number of idiomatic choices made \u2018in \nisolation\u2019 and \u2018in context\u2019 for each type of idiom were treated as the dependent \nvariables in a four-way analysis of variance. The ANOVA had the following factors: \ncomprehension level (good, poor) was a between-subjects factor, context (present, \nabsent), familiarity (real, novel) and transparency (transparent, opaque) were \nwithin-subjects factors.  \nThere were significant main effects of comprehension level, F(1,28) = 6.35, p < \n.05, \u03b7p2  = .19, context, F(1,28) = 93.72 p < .001, \u03b7p2  = .77, familiarity, F(1,28) = 5.33 p < \n.05, \u03b7p2  = .16, and transparency, F(1,28) = 60.29, p < .001, \u03b7p2  = .68. There was a \nsignificant two-way interaction between context and transparency, F(1,28) = 33.58, p \n< .001, \u03b7p2 = .55. There were two three-way interactions. One involved the factors \ncontext, transparency, and familiarity: F(1,28) = 5.06, p < .05, \u03b7p2 = .15; the other \ninvolved comprehension level, context, and transparency, F(1,28) = 4.83, p < .05, \u03b7p2 = \n.15. Each three-way interaction was explored further.  \nThe interaction between context, transparency and familiarity was explored \nby analysing the performance of the real and novel idioms, separately, because of \nour interest in factors that may influence acquisition. In each analysis, there were \nsignificant main effects of context and transparency and a significant interaction \nbetween the two, all Fs > 6.40 all ps < .01.  \nThe other three-way interaction involving comprehension level, context, and \ntransparency is depicted in Figure 1. The issue of interest here is whether the groups \ndiffer in their use of context to derive meaning for idioms, so the interaction was \nexplored by analysing performance for the two types of idioms separately. For \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n17 \ntransparent idioms, there was a main effect of context, F(1,28) = 19.13, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = \n.15, but the effect of comprehension level and the interaction did not reach \nsignificance, both Fs < 1.70, ps > .10.  For opaque idioms, there were main effects of \ncontext, F(1, 28) = 121.86, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .81, group, F(1, 28) = 7.95, p < .01, \u03b7p2 = .22, \nand an interaction, F(1, 28) = 5.15, p < .05, \u03b7p2 = .15. This interaction was explored \nwith t-tests using an \u03b1 level of .0125 to correct for 4 comparisons. The interaction \narose because the groups did not differ in their performance when the opaque \nidioms were presented in isolation, t(28) < 1.0, but the good comprehenders obtained \nhigher scores when opaque idioms were presented in context, t(28) = 3.69, p < .005. \n \nFIGURE 1 AROUND HERE \n \nMechanisms of acquisition: analysis of novel idioms. To determine the relative \nimportance of the processing mechanisms proposed to aid the acquisition of \nidiomatic meaning, an analysis of performance on the novel items only was \nconducted. The effect of comprehension level did not reach significance, F(1,28) = \n3.19, p = .09. There were, however, significant and sizeable effects of context, F(1,28) \n= 58.14, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .68, and transparency, F(1,28) = 30.13, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .52. There \nwas a significant two-way interaction between context and transparency, F(1,28) = \n10.35, p < .005, \u03b7p2 = .27, explored with corrected comparisons (\u03b1 = .0125). It arose \nbecause performance on the transparent and opaque idioms differed when \npresented in isolation, t(29)  = 6.08, p < .001 (Ms = 3.43, 1.90, in order), but the \ndifference in context did not reach our stringent level of significance, t(29) = 4.27, p = \n.043 (Ms = 4.47, 3.93). The interaction between context, transparency, and group did \nnot reach conventional levels of significance, F(1,28) = 3.72, p = .064, \u03b7p2 = .12.  \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n18 \n \nAnalysis of errors \nThree types of error were possible: selection of the plausible figurative \ninterpretation, the implausible figurative interpretation, or the literal interpretation \nof the phrase (see Table 2 for examples). The mean total numbers obtained for each \nchoice, for the good and poor comprehenders are shown in Table 4. There were six \nchildren who did not make any errors in one condition (out of a possible 8). For that \nreason, the errors were analysed in relation to the total number of errors made in \nisolation (four conditions) and in context (four conditions).  \n \nTABLE 4 AROUND HERE \n \nIdioms in isolation. To determine whether the poor comprehenders had a literal \nprocessing tendency (as found for younger children, Levorato & Cacciari, 1999), the \nproportion of remaining responses that were literal response options was compared \nbetween groups. The groups did not differ, t(28) = 1.12, p > .20 (Ms = .23 and .29 for \nthe good and poor comprehension groups, respectively).  \nIdioms in context. To determine whether the poor comprehenders were less \nlikely to make appropriate use of context, the proportion of remaining responses that \nwere plausible in the context of the story was compared between groups. This \nresponse error option was the most common for both groups. It was more likely to \nbe made by the good comprehenders, t(28) = 2.52, p < .02, d = .83 (Ms = .73 and .56 \nfor the good and poor groups, respectively). The poor comprehenders made more \nimplausible choices than the good comprehenders (Ms = .15 and .36 for the good and \npoor groups, respectively). \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n19 \nContribution of semantic analysis skills. The two groups did not obtain \nsignificantly different scores on the ambiguous sentences task: good comprehenders \n= 45.26 (SD=7.90), poor comprehenders = 41.33 (SD=6.77), t(28) = 1.46, p > .15, \nindicating the poor comprehenders did not have a significant impairment in their \nability to provide two alternate meanings for the items. A series of two-tailed \ncorrelations was performed to look at the relation between semantic analysis skills \nand performance on the four types of idiom in and out of context. Performance on \nthe semantic analysis task was correlated with scores for the real and novel \ntransparent idioms in context and in isolation, rs = .36 - .61, ps < .05, but not \nsignificantly with performance on the opaque idioms, rs < .30. \nDiscussion \nWhen presented with idioms in isolation, the good and poor comprehenders \nboth demonstrated skill in analysing the internal semantics of the phrase to work out \nthe meanings of transparent idioms: both groups obtained scores that were \nsignificantly above chance. Further, the good and poor comprehenders did not differ \nin their ability to derive alternative meanings of phrases containing ambiguous \nwords. Together, these findings indicate that the poor comprehenders were able to \nuse semantic analysis skills to work out appropriate meanings for transparent \nidioms. Both groups benefited from the presence of a supportive story context, but \nthe poor comprehenders were less able to use this information to work out the \nmeaning of novel opaque idioms. Analysis of error responses indicated that the poor \ncomprehenders were less likely, in general, to use context appropriately: they made \nproportionately fewer errors that were plausible within the context of the story. \nThese findings are discussed in relation to our understanding about idiom \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n20 \ncomprehension, the development of idiom comprehension, and the nature of \nreading comprehension difficulties. \nThis study supports Cain et al.\u2019s (2005) findings that individual differences in \nidiom comprehension are not solely attributable to knowledge differences. The task \ndeveloped for the current research did not rely on an individual\u2019s knowledge of \nidioms: we assessed understanding of phrases rather than idiom stem completion (in \ncontrast to Nesi et al., 2006), we compared performance for transparent and opaque \nitems (in contrast to Levorato et al., 2004) and, uniquely, we used novel idioms to \nassess children\u2019s ability to derive the meanings of idioms. We did not find strong \neffects of the familiarity variable: there was a significant but small advantage for real \nover novel idioms, but the pattern of performance on real and novel idioms in \nrelation to both transparency and context was comparable. This suggests that our \nreal idioms were not well known by this age group.  \nPoor comprehenders\u2019 difficulties on measures of idiom comprehension were \nrelated to their ability to use context to derive an appropriate interpretation, rather \nthan their ability to analyse the phrase. Both groups were aided by the presence of \nthe supportive context and the effect size associated with this factor was large. In \naddition, there was a sizeable effect of group in the analysis of errors made in \ncontext, indicating that the poor comprehenders\u2019 were less able to detect and\/or \nselect and use the cues in context to derive appropriate meanings. However, the \ngroups performed comparably on transparent idioms and did not differ on the \nmeasure of semantic analysis. These findings support other research on idioms that \nemphasises the importance of comprehending language in context (e.g., Gibbs, 1987; \nLevorato & Cacciari, 1995; Nippold & Martin, 1989). Further, our findings indicate \nthat children with specific reading comprehension difficulties have a difficulty with \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n21 \nthe use of context to derive appropriate meanings of idioms, that is not fully \naccounted for by weak semantic processing abilities.  \nAs stated, the poor comprehenders\u2019 scores improved when idioms were \npresented in context, but their performance was not as good as that of the good \ncomprehenders and the error analysis indicated that they were less likely to select \nthe contextually appropriate distracter than were the good comprehenders. \nTogether, these findings suggest that the poor comprehenders are impaired in their \nability to select appropriate cues from context and use these to derive the meanings \nof unfamiliar idioms. Other work has highlighted this population\u2019s difficulties with \nthe use of context to generate appropriate inferences to ensure adequate \ncomprehension: poor comprehenders are capable of generating inferences, but fail to \ngenerate as many target inferences as good comprehenders (Cain, Oakhill, & \nLemmon, 2004; Cain & Oakhill, 1999; Cain et al., 2001). Further, they continue to \nhave difficulties, even when the text is available to search through (e.g., Cain & \nOakhill, 1999; Oakhill, 1984). Together with the current findings, this work suggests \nthat remediation should focus on how to select and use context when processing \nprose.  \nWe used a multiple-choice task, which does not necessarily tap meaning \ngeneration processes: children may have performed the task by checking the \nresponse options against the meaning of the text, rather than by first deriving the \nmeaning of the phrase. The advantage of the multiple-choice task is that children are \nnot required to produce a verbal explanation, which might prejudice children with \nweaker language skills (Spooner, Gathercole, & Baddeley, 2006). Our use of this task, \ntogether with the explanation task used by Cain et al. (2005) provides evidence of \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n22 \ntask validity and converging evidence of poor comprehenders\u2019 specific difficulties \nwith using context to guide text comprehension.  \nWe did not find any evidence of a preference for a literal processing strategy; \nrather the poor comprehenders had a tendency to select the contextually implausible \nresponse option. However, we know from studies of idiom processing in skilled \nadult language users that selection of literal meanings indicates that the literal \nmeaning of the phrase is activated (Cacciari & Tabossi, 1988; Titone & Connine, \n1999). It has been suggested that poor comprehenders and children with Autism \nSpectrum Disorder may experience difficulties with idiom comprehension because \nthey fail to suppress or inhibit the literal \u2013 and, therefore, contextually irrelevant - \ninterpretation of the phrase (Levorato, Nesi, & Cacciari, 2004; Norbury, 2004). Other \nlines of research indicate that children with reading comprehension difficulties may \nhave weak suppression mechanisms (Barnes, Faulkner, Wilkinson, & Dennis, 2004; \nCain, 2006; de Beni & Palladino, 2000). Our study did not use an on-line task to \ninvestigate the activation of meaning of known idioms. Future work using such a \nparadigm is needed to investigate whether poor comprehenders\u2019 difficulties extend \nbeyond the processing of novel idioms to the retrieval of the figurative meaning for \nfamiliar expressions and\/or the suppression of the literal meaning. \nOur study adds to the recent literature on the development of idiom \ncomprehension in two important ways. First, we have demonstrated that poor \ncomprehenders\u2019 difficulties with idiom comprehension are not due to a general \ndelay in the language processing skills that aid idiom comprehension. Their \ndifficulties are related to their problems with processing language in context. Idiom \nlearning is not all or none. As Nippold has argued in her language experience \nhypothesis of idiom comprehension, meanings will be consolidated and refined with \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n23 \nrepeated exposure of these phrases in different contexts (e.g., Nippold & Martin, \n1989). The effects of idiom familiarity remain strong in adolescence (e.g., Nippold & \nRudzinski, 1993). Children with language difficulties may fail to benefit fully from \nexposure to figurative language, which may impede the expansion of their \nknowledge of figurative language. Second, our study provides good evidence that \nboth semantic analysis and inference from context are important skills that can aid \ngrowth in idiomatic knowledge. These findings broadly support Levorato and \nCacciari\u2019s (1995) model of figurative competence.  \nThe identification of where the problem with idiom processing arises has \nimportant implications for remediation. Future work should include measures of on-\nline processing to understand more fully how children with typical and atypical \nlanguage development process idioms in real time. As discussed above, we do not \nknow whether poor comprehenders are impaired in their suppression of competing \nliteral interpretations of figurative expressions. The ability to comprehend the \nintended figurative meaning of an idiom also depends on the ability to monitor \none\u2019s comprehension of a text during reading in order to appreciate that a truly \nliteral interpretation of a phrase is contextually inappropriate. The ability to monitor \ncomprehension is related to both reading comprehension level and age (Baker, 1984; \nOakhill, Hartt, & Samols, 2005). We are currently investigating whether younger and \nolder children, and good and poor comprehenders, differ in their detection of \nfigurative forms.  \nIn summary, this study has demonstrated that poor comprehenders\u2019 \ndifficulties with the processing of novel and unfamiliar idioms are related to their \nestablished impairments with inference from context: their semantic processing \nskills appear intact. These findings suggest that poor comprehenders are able to \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n24 \nfocus on local, sentence-level meaning, and that they are able to make use of context \nto a limited extent. However, they fail to take the overall meaning of the text into \naccount when deriving meanings for unfamiliar idioms. Future work should \ndetermine how best to support poor comprehenders\u2019 to identify, select and use \nappropriate contextual cues. These data demonstrate the importance of contextual \nprocessing for idiom comprehension.  \nIdiom understanding and reading difficulties  \n25 \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by a British Academy research grant LRG-39543 awarded \nto the first author.
