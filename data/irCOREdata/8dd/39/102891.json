For this to come to fruition the\nlifetime and emission site density of these materials needs to\nbe maximized for low operating electric fields to levels at\nwhich a display device may be technically and commercially\nviable. One of the most important experimental parameters\nexamined in the research conducted is the emission threshold\nelectric field of a thin film. This threshold field is defined\nhere as the applied macroscopic electric field at which a\nclose to steady-state emission current of 1 nA is measured\nfor a conditioned film. In this letter we report on the depen-\ndence of the threshold field of hydrogenated amorphous car-\nbon (a-C:H) and nitrogenated tetrahedral amorphous carbon\n(ta-C:N) thin films on film thickness. We examine the ex-\nperimental results in terms of various emission models pro-\nposed for thin amorphous semiconductors.\na-C:H films were deposited using a radio-frequency\n~RF! capacitively coupled Plasmatech DP800 plasma-\nenhanced chemical-vapor deposition ~PECVD! system con-\nfigured with a water-cooled, earthed substrate table.

A He plasma preclean was performed at ambi-\nent temperature on the substrates with 75 sccm helium flow\nat a pressure and RF power of 200 mTorr and 200 W, re-\nspectively.

A\nset of samples with different film thicknesses were grown by\nvarying the deposition time for each sample. The thickness\nof the film on each sample was then measured using ellip-\nsometry, to a precision of 63 nm. These films were then\nsubject to field-emission testing.\nThe field-emission properties of the a-C:H films were\ninvestigated using a \u2018\u2018sphere-to-plane\u2019\u2019 electrode configura-\ntion with a 5 mm diam stainless-steel ball anode, 40 mm\na!Corresponding author.

Samples were subject to a for-\nward bias until an emission current of 500 nA was detected\nor a maximum macroscopic field of 90 V\/mm was reached.\nThe voltage cycling and current\/voltage measurements were\ncomputer controlled to ensure repeatability of the testing\nprocedure. A relatively high applied field was required for\nemission to be initiated for all the a-C:H films in the first\ncycle and a considerable hysterisis in the current\/applied\nfield characteristics was observed, as shown in Fig. 1. For\nsuccessive voltage cycles, this hysterisis diminished with\neach successive cycle\u2014a conditioning process. Typically,\nthis hysterisis was no longer present after 3 or 4 voltage\ncycles. Reverse bias tests were also performed after each set\nof measurements on every sample to check for short circuits\nand to validate the results. Testing was performed on five\ndifferent areas of each sample to gauge the repeatability of\nthe results. The conditioned electric field for these devices\nwas measured and a standard deviation for the threshold\nelectric field was no more than 5 V\/mm.

No mor-\nphological changes were apparent on the micron scale and no\nevidence of any difference in surface roughness between the\ndifferent film thicknesses was detected. A set of similarly\nprepared samples were examined in an atomic force micro-\nscope ~AFM! and exhibited rms surface roughness values of\nless than 5 \u00c5 with no discernible relationship between the\nthickness and roughness. A similar study on nitrogen-doped\ntetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C:N) films was carried\nout, independent of the a-C:H work, by Cheah and Shi.\nThese films were deposited using a filtered cathodic vacuum\narc ~FCVA! system at an energy of 100 eV on n11-Si sub-\nstrates. The nitrogen was obtained from a 100 eV ion source\nwith a 20 mA beam current resulting in a bulk nitrogen con-\ntent of 30 at. %. The testing regime employed and hysteresis\neffects observed were similar to that described for the a-C:H\nfilms.\nThe data shown in Fig. 2 show a strong dependence of\nthe conditioned threshold field on film thickness. More spe-\ncifically, the data for both types of films show that there is a\nminimum turning point in the threshold field with film thick-\nness. For the a-C:H films this minimum occurs around 60\nnm and for the ta-C:N films the minimum occurs at around\n30 nm. This indicates that there is a window for optimizing\nthe electron field-emission properties of these films. It is in-\nteresting that this thickness dependence phenomenon has\nbeen observed for two different types of amorphous carbon\n(a-C) with vastly differing microstructural properties, de-\nposited and tested independent of each other. In order to\nattempt to explain these experimental results we examine the\ndifferent models that have been proposed to describe elec-\ntron field emission from thin films.\nThe classical explanation for electron field emission\nfrom a surface is Fowler\u2013Nordheim ~FN! tunneling,7 which\nis generally aided by high-field enhancement factors ~b!.\nHere, electrons tunnel from the Fermi level at the film sur-\nface through an approximately triangular potential barrier\ninto vacuum. This model can be described by the simplified\nFN equation.5\nI5\nBb2V2A\nF\nexpF2 CF3\/2bV G , ~1!\nFIG. 2.

Redistribution subject to AIP lwhere, I is the emission current ~amps!, b is a geometrical\nfactor ~cm21!, V is the applied potential ~volts!, A is the\nemission area ~cm2!, f is the work function ~eV!, and B and\nC are numerical constants. This emission mechanism applied\nto a nominally flat cathode requires surface features, or pro-\ntrusions, to produce a large enough field enhancement ~b! to\nallow the local electric field to be great enough to permit the\ntunneling. For this model to predict the observed trend either\nf or b, or both, needs to change significantly and systemati-\ncally with film thickness. There is little reason to expect, or\nevidence to support, the possibility that the work function\n~f! would depend significantly on film thickness. As stated\npreviously, the SEM and AFM images offered no evidence\nin support of the existence of surface morphological changes\nwith film thickness and, hence, changes in b cannot account\nfor the observed threshold field dependence on film thick-\nness. Although it may be, as previously reported,8 that there\nare nanoprotrusions on the film surface, it is difficult to see\nhow these would vary in systematic manner to explain the\nparticular threshold field\/film thickness relationship ob-\nserved. Fowler\u2013Nordheim calculations performed on the\na-C:H data, assuming a work function of 2 eV for these\nfilms, required field enhancement factors greater than 1000\nto satisfy the FN equation. Atomistic bond reordering on the\nsurface of the emitting films giving rise to high b factors and\npossible changes in the threshold field could not be easily\nexamined. Consequently, FN theory does not appear to suc-\ncessfully explain the experimental results observed in Fig. 2.\nThere are other possible emission mechanisms, for ex-\nample, Krauss et al.9 suggest that the emission could be due\nto quantum effects from sp2 cluster edges. It is not obvious\nhow this model could account for the results reported in this\nstudy as it does not appear to be thickness dependent. A\nchange in the sp2\/sp3 content of the film as a function of\nthickness could, in theory, affect the emission properties in\nthe Krauss model. However, for our films, measured param-\neters such as refractive index and optical band gap do not\nshow any significant variation with film thickness, and there-\nfore, it is unlikely that the sp2\/sp3 varies as a function of\nthickness in our films. Robertson10 proposed an emission\nmechanism for diamond-like carbon films based on nonuni-\nform hydrogen termination at the film surface. In this work,\nemission is postulated as occurring mainly from nanometer-\nsized surface regions unterminated by hydrogen. However,\nwe do not expect the hydrogen termination at the surface of\nour films to be thickness dependent, and therefore, do not\nbelieve the Robertson model to be applicable to this work.\nA space-charge-induced bandbending interlayer model\nwas also proposed for field emission from a-C films.4,11 A\nsimilar model was originally proposed by Latham and Bay-\nliss to explain emission from metal\/insulator structures.12 An\nimportant feature that distinguishes the space-charge-induced\nbandbending model for semiconductors from that proposed\nby Latham is that these films, unlike insulators, can sustain a\nthickness-dependent electric field. In the proposed model it is\nthe heterojunction and bandbending within the film that are\nimportant.11 In our model, the bandbending occurs as a result\nof carrier depletion across the whole thickness of the a-C\nfilm, which gives rise to a maximum internal electric field\nclose to the heterojunction.

Lett., Vol. 73, No. 25, 21 December 1998 Forrest et al.\nDownparable situations have been simulated by Lerner et al.,13,14\nwho have once more shown the internal field to be greater\nthan the applied external field. The phenomenon of the local\nelectric fields in the film being much greater than the applied\nelectric field was qualitatively described by Amaratunga and\nSilva4 and also shown experimentally by Schlesser et al.15 In\nthe case of the work reported by Schlesser et al.,15 they\nshowed the internal field within the material as approxi-\nmately a factor of 10 greater than the applied external field.\nIn the proposed model, Fig. 3, electrons tunnel from the con-\nduction band of the n-doped silicon substrate into the highly\ncurved conduction band of the a-C:H film. Conduction-band\nemission has also been proposed by Schlesser et al.15 and\nChoi et al.16 These electrons then become \u2018\u2018hot\u2019\u2019 while tra-\nversing the film, as shown by Fitting et al.,17 and possibly,\ndepending on the film thickness, retain enough energy to\novercome the surface barrier of the a-C:H films ~2\u20133 eV! to\nvacuum. It should also be noted that the only value available\nfor the effective tunneling mass of electrons in a-C:H is\napproximately 0.07 me .18 This may give rise to energy re-\nlaxation lengths ~which are typically several mean-free paths\nin magnitude! greater than those usually associated with\namorphous materials.\nA possible trajectory for hot electrons generated by the\npresence of the highly curved local electric fields in the\na-C:H is shown in Fig. 3. The rate of electron energy loss to\nthe lattice with thickness is taken as a constant to a first\napproximation in Fig. 3. The schematic path for electrons\nindicated by the dashed line is shown to illustrate that the\nemission from these films could occur as a function of film\nthickness. It should be noted that despite the loss of energy\nto the lattice with thickness, the electrons gain energy with\nrespect to the conduction band at low thicknesses. It high-\nlights the fact that there possibly is an optimum thickness for\nfield-emission threshold fields ~case b! and that if the film\nFIG. 3. Band diagram illustrating the case of hot electron transport through\na depleted a-C film under the influence of a given applied electric field. The\nvalence bands have been omitted to minimize the complexity of the dia-\ngram. The emission barrier is shown for three different film thicknesses\n~cases a, b, and c! along with a possible path taken by the hot electrons. The\ndiagram demonstrates that emission will not occur for the thinnest and thick-\nest films ~cases a and c!, but it may for the intermediate film thickness ~case\nb!.loaded 01 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP lthickness is too large ~case c!, the a-C:H films would not be\nfully depleted, and therefore, the energy loss of the hot elec-\ntrons ~relative to the conduction band! would be large and\nthus prevent it from escaping from the surface. If the film\nthickness is too thin ~case a!, electrons that are emitted from\nthe heterojunction ~either thermally or by tunneling! will not\ngain enough energy relative to the conduction band for them\nto be able to surmount the emission barrier to vacuum. The\nvariation of the threshold field discussed qualitatively as a\nfunction of thickness is observed in the experimental data\npresented for two sets of differing carbon films shown in Fig.\n2. This gives us confidence that the electron emission from\na-C may be explained using a space-charge-induced band-\nbending \u2018\u2018interlayer\u2019\u2019 model, in which the real cathode is the\nn-Si substrate with the a-C film acting as an \u2018\u2018interlayer.\u2019\u2019\nIn conclusion, we have presented field-emission data\nfrom a-C:H and ta-C:N with a distinctive film thickness\/\nthreshold field dependence. We have examined our data with\nrespect to different field-emission models, and while more\ncharacterization is needed for a definitive model, we believe\na space-charge-induced \u2018\u2018interlayer\u2019\u2019 model can best explain\nthese results.\nThe authors would like to thank R.
