Tectonic erosion during \nsubduction (Herv\u00e9 and Fanning 2003) or the \nsubsequent removal of accreted material during \ntranspression (Vaughan and Livermore 2005), could \nexplain the volumetrically small proportion of \npreserved accreted material. Moreover, Vaughan and \nLivermore (2005) proposed that short-lived stress \nincreases at plate boundaries, caused by the arrival of \nmantle plumes at the base of the lithosphere, may have \ncontrolled accretion, e.g., spanning the Triassic-\nJurassic boundary and in the mid-Cretaceous. \nAccurately establishing the timing of accretion to \nthe South American and Antarctic Peninsula \nGondwana margin is difficult because of the paucity of \nfossils and overstepping unconformities, and the lack \nof crosscutting intrusions. Instead, detrital mineral \ngeochronology has been used to provide maximum \ndepositional ages and limits on accretion (Herv\u00e9 et al., \n2003a, b). \nThis study focuses on the timing of accretion of the \nScotia Metamorphic Complex, an accretionary \ncomplex on the South Orkney Islands (Fig. 1; Tanner \net al., 1982; Dalziel 1984). Existing K-Ar (Tanner et \nal., 1982; Rex 1976; Grikurov et al., 1967; Miller \n1960) and Ar-Ar mineral ages (Grunow et al., 1992) \nsuffer from extraneous argon and are open to \ninterpretation.  Critically the range of ages obtained \n(204 Ma \u2013 176 Ma) spans two major plume events \u2013 \nthe Late Triassic Central Atlantic Magmatic Province \nand the Early Jurassic Karoo \u2013 Ferrar \u2013 Chon Aike \nepisode \u2013 such that any causal link is difficult to \ndetermine. Where extraneous argon is prevalent, Rb-Sr \ngeochronology can be a viable alternative (Willigers et \nal., 2004). This paper presents new Rb-Sr muscovite \nand biotite ages in order to determine whether \naccretion correlates with either of the plume events. \n \nGeology of the South Orkney Islands \nThe Scotia Metamorphic Complex (Tanner et al., \n1982) of the South Orkney Islands differs from many \nother accretionary complexes in the Scotia Sea region \nin its higher metamorphic grade and unconformable \ncontact with overlying fossiliferous sequences. The \npredominantly semi-pelitic complex contains marble \nand garnetiferous quartzites (metacherts) as well as \nabundant metabasites with an enriched-type MORB \nand alkaline ocean-island basalt chemistry (Storey and \nMeneilly 1985). On Signy Island (Fig. 1), metamorphic \nconditions are estimated to be 8kbar and 545\u00b0C (Storey \nand Meneilly 1985). The complex is interpreted as a \ntectonic mixture as blastomylonitic zones within the \ncomplex are thought to separate oceanic (including \nmetabasite lithologies) and continental material (Storey \nand Meneilly 1985). Based on the appearance of \nmetabasite lithologies (Trouw et al., 1997a), the \njunction with the Greywacke Shale Formation, a \nsedimentary protolith with a wholly continental \nprovenance (Andreis et al., 1997), is thought to occur \non eastern-most Coronation Island. On Powell Island, \nthe metamorphic grade increases from anchizone (c. \n4kbar at 275\u00b0C) through the biotite and garnet isograds \nreaching conditions similar (c. 7kbar at 500\u00b0C) to those \nof Signy (Trouw et al., 1997a, b) consistent with the \njuxtaposition of the Greywacke Shale Formation with \nthe Scotia Metamorphic Complex metamorphism \nduring accretion. \nThe Greywacke Shale Formation and Scotia \nMetamorphic Complex also share an early polyphase \n10th International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences \n2 \ntectonic history (Meneilly and Storey 1986; Trouw et \nal., 1997a). The second phase of deformation resulted \nin a pervasive mineral lineation and mica foliation \naccompanying growth of relatively high pressure \u2013 low \ntemperature metamorphic assemblages, believed to \nhave formed as a result of south-directed (present co-\nordinates) subduction (Trouw et al., 1997a). \n \nTiming of subduction and accretion \nUnconformable sequences are exposed in two \nseparate areas on Powell and Coronation Islands (Fig. \n1) but, despite similar sedimentological characteristics, \nyield different apparent stratigraphical ages. The \nmacrofossil fauna of the Coronation Island sequences \nindicate a late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age \n(Thomson and Willey 1975). A fossil flora from the \nPowell Island Conglomerate is considered Early\u2013\nMiddle Jurassic (Cantrill 2000) and is correlated with \nthe Botany Bay flora dated at c. 167 Ma by Hunter et \nal. (2005). Until the stratigraphic age is confirmed, \nminimum age estimates for accretion are open to \ninterpretation.  \nChert from Scapa Rock, within the outcrop area of \nthe Greywacke Shale Formation (Fig. 1), contains Late \nTriassic radiolaria (Dalziel et al., 1981). Its value as a \nmaximum age limit for accretion is compromised, \nhowever, due to the large stratigraphic range for this \nfauna.  Rb-Sr and K-Ar whole rock age determinations \n(Fig. 2; Tanner et al., 1982; Trouw et al., 1997a, b), \nalthough somewhat unreliable due to imprecision or \nlack of control on extraneous argon, support the \nradiolarian fossil evidence and suggest accretion of \nPermian-Triassic protoliths. Direct dating of \nmetamorphic minerals (Fig. 2) has yielded equivocal \nresults due to lack of confidence in the available K-Ar \nand Ar-Ar ages (see above). \n \nGeochronology \nRb-Sr geochronology was carried out on micas that \ngrew during the second regional tectonothermal event. \nIn the schists, muscovite and biotite define the S2 \nfoliation together with quartz-feldspar segregations. \nNew mica growth is minimal during D3, e.g., F3 folds \nlack axial planar mica. Quartz but not feldspar is \ncommonly recrystallized by D3. Within marbles, \nmuscovite is randomly orientated as part of a coarse \ngranular texture. D3 involves cataclasis and thus the \ndated micas are considered to be MS2 in age. \nMetabasites have an amphibolite, epidote and \nplagioclase foliation with MP2 biotite porphyroblasts. \nRb-Sr analyses (Table 1) were undertaken at the \nSchool of Geological Sciences, University College \nDublin, Ireland. 99% pure handpicked mineral \nseparates (c. 0.03 g), were spiked with a mixed 85Rb-\n84Sr spike and dissolved in a 5:1 HF and HNO3 acid \nmixture. Chemical separation of Sr used TruSPEC \nresin whilst separation of Rb used traditional \nchromatography. Rb and Sr were analysed on modified \nVG Micromass 30 and VG 354 thermal ionisation mass \nspectrometers, respectively. Rb\/Sr uncertainty is \nestimated to be 1.5% based on repeat analysis of the \nSRM 607 K-feldspar standard, while the 87Sr\/86Sr 2\u03c3 \nanalytical uncertainties in Table 1 were used for age \ncalculations (Figs 1, 2). During analysis the SRM 987 \nSr standard yielded a 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 0.710241 \u00b1 18 \n(2\u03c3, n = 6). Ages were calculated using the 87Rb decay \nconstant of 1.42 \u00d7 10-11 (Steiger and J\u00e4ger 1977).  \n \nFigure 1.

Despite \ntextural equilibrium, isotopic disequilibrium could \nexist, as the two minerals are unlikely to have closed  \nsimultaneously (see below). The results are considered \nrobust however, because ages from different \nlithologies, over a large area (Fig. 1), using different \nlow Rb\/Sr phases (Table 1) are indistinguishable. \nAssuming control by volume diffusion (Dodson \n1973), the muscovite Rb-Sr system would close at c. \n500\u00b0C (Cliff 1985), around the maximum metamorphic \ntemperature for the South Orkney rocks. More recent \nstudies, as summarised by Villa (2006), illustrate a \nmultitude of additional factors influencing closure, \nincluding mineral and fluid compositions, deformation, \nrecrystallization and the proximity of sinks for \ndaughter isotopes. It is our view that the muscovite \nages from South Orkney record Sr isotopic equilibrium \nachieved by a combination of metamorphic fluid-\nmineral interaction, recrystallization and mineral \ngrowth during D2 associated with subduction-\naccretion. \nThe lower Rb\/Sr and Rb concentrations and higher \nSr concentrations in the South Orkney biotites (Table \n1) may indicate disruption of a formerly closed system. \nHowever, the consistency of the ages suggests \nmeaningful results, though their geological significance \nis unclear. It is possible that the ages record fluid \ninteraction during uplift, accompanied by minor \nchloritisation. Thus they should not be interpreted \nsimply as dating cooling below c. 300\u00b0C, the widely \naccepted closure temperature for biotite (Cliff 1985). \n \n     Coincidence of plume events and accretion \nThe Central Atlantic magmatic province produced \nvoluminous tholeiitic volcanism at c. 200 Ma (Nomade \net al., 2007), which has been widely linked to the \narrival of a mantle plume (Oyarzun et al., 1997), whilst \nthe Karoo \u2013 Ferrar provinces had major basaltic \nvolcanism at c. 182 Ma (Riley and Knight 2001). The \nChon Aike province was almost entirely silicic and was \ncharacterized by two main peaks of volcanism at c. 183 \nMa and c. 170 Ma (Pankhurst et al., 2000; Hunter et \nal., 2006). The Rb-Sr ages reported here record \naccretion at c. 190 Ma, which is midway between the \nage of maximum volcanism of the Central Atlantic and \nKaroo \u2013 Ferrar provinces. Seemingly then, accretion at \nthe margin is not coeval with impingement of either \nplume, a notion supported by geochronology from \naccretionary complexes elsewhere on the Gondwana \nmargin (e.g. F\u00e9raud et al., 1997). \nHowever, by looking at the dyke record of the \nKaroo \u2013 Ferrar volcanic province, a more complete \npicture of its evolution is revealed. Geochemistry from \na suite of dykes (Riley et al., 2005) provides the \nstrongest evidence that the province was, at least in \npart, related to the arrival of a mantle plume. The dykes \ninclude picrites and ferropicrites that were derived \nfrom deep-seated, depleted mantle, interpreted as melts \nfrom a mantle plume as it approached the base of the \nlithosphere (Riley et al., 2005). Ar-Ar geochronology \n(Riley et al., 2005) demonstrates that the picrites and \n10th International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences \n \n4 \nferropicrites, at 190 Ma, are significantly older than the \nmain Karoo magmatic peak of 182 Ma. \n \nSummary \nCoincidence of the timing of metamorphism and \nthe picritic magmatism at 190 Ma would appear to \nsubstantiate a causative link between plume initiation \nand accretion and provides further support for the \nVaughan and Livermore (2005) model. \n \nAcknowledgements: MJF acknowledges support from the crew of \nthe Ernest Shackleton, staff at Signy base and field assistance from \nLiz Homer.
