Using these resources effectively and with a\nsound pedagogical basis presents a whole array of issues for teaching professionals. In\nthis paper the authors describe the development and implementation of a Web interface\nto existing computer-based learning materials in an attempt to enhance the student\nlearning experience. Although the innovations occurred in two very different disciplines -\nstatistics and law - there are common lessons to be learned about the process of learning\nand the use of technology.\nIntroduction\nBoth authors were seconded part-time to the Coventry University Teaching and Learning\nTask Force in the autumn of 1997. There are two main driving forces behind this Task\nForce. The first is the changing context of higher education, where increasing numbers of\nstudents, the shrinking unit of resource and an increasing emphasis on learning and\nteaching is generating increasing concern about the quality of the student experience. The\nsecond is to test how far communications and information technology (C&IT), highlighted\nin the Dealing Report (National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education, 1997),\ncould provide an important vehicle for more successful learning. At the same time there is\nan ongoing expansion of global learning resources available through the Internet.\nHarnessing these resources in a way that will enrich student learning became a focal point\nfor both projects.\nThe authors come from two very different subject areas and, since law is not taught to\nstatisticians nor statistics to lawyers, their paths would not normally have crossed. However,\nCoventry University's Task Force is divided into 'theme groups' and it is in such a group\n87\nDavid Grantham and Neville Hunt Web interfaces to enhance CAL materials: case studies from law and statistics\nthat the authors came to realize that their individual projects share some important\ncommon concerns and objectives. This article identifies those concerns and describes how\nthe authors set about designing an electronic learning environment to deal with them. Both\nprojects take existing CAL software (the 'basic packages', IOLIS for law and DISCUS for\nstatistics) as their starting point and both aim to identify clearly, through evaluation, the\nperceived weaknesses in that software. Through an ongoing process of reflection,\ndiscussion, development and experimentation the authors have attempted to address these\ndeficiencies before the evaluation stage again triggers a cycle of curriculum development.\nMethodology\nWe are both engaged in the kind of critical and self-reflective enquiry described by Carr\nand Kemmis (1986) and Schon (1987) and falling under the general rubric of 'action\nresearch'. Conscious of the need to solve what we both perceived as a problem with current\nelectronic resources in our respective fields, we were led to question the pedagogy that\nappeared to underpin them. Action research can, and in our case did, set in motion an\nenquiry into the very nature of teaching and learning and into the inner structure of our\nsubjects. As McKernan (1996) observes: \"The professional teacher must have an answer to\nthose who ask the question \"What is the purpose of teaching?\" To my mind the purpose of\nteaching is to understand the nature of knowledge' (p. 48).\nOur efforts to produce a meaningful learning environment made us question the essential\nnature of our disciplines. We cannot say that we have found all the answers but, in any case,\naction research is 'cyclical' and we continue to develop our work over time and in the light\nof our reflection along the discuss-design-test-review continuum.\nAnother feature of action research, described by Kemmis and McTaggart (1988), is that it\nis collaborative, encouraging colleagues to share the issues, processes and fruits of the\nresearch. Support from other colleagues in the Task Force, both technical and pedagogical,\nwas a crucial part of both the 'reflective' and 'action' stages of the process. Both authors\nare committed to conveying to interested colleagues the results of their projects and to\ncoaching them in the technical aspects of the developments. This is an important stage in\ndisseminating the innovation as well as maintaining the momentum of change. Action\nresearch also provides a sound platform for continuing professional development and we\nare both keen to make ever closer links between the theory and practice of learning and\nteaching, one of the hallmarks of the 'extended professional' referred to by Hoyle (1980).\nCritiques of the basic packages\nIntroduced in 1995, IOLIS is a computer-assisted learning package commonly referred to\nas 'courseware' and authored by leading academics under the auspices of the Law\nCourseware Consortium, based at the University of Warwick. Features of IOLIS have\nbeen described elsewhere (Widdison, 1995; Moodie, 1997; Paliwala, 1998) but can be\nsummarized as follows:\n\u2022 an easy to use and powerful navigation system;\n\u2022 self-test questions with feedback;\n\u2022 excellent resource books with leading case reports and some leading articles;\nAn-} Volume 7 Number 3\n\u2022 self-paced learning;\n\u2022 an increasingly wide range of subjects or modules;\n\u2022 a scrapbook and copying\/printing facility;\n\u2022 twice yearly updates.\nDISCUS (Discovering Important Statistical Concepts Using Spreadsheets) comprises a set\nof eight Microsoft Excel workbooks, accompanied by paper-based exercises, covering a\nselection of topics in elementary statistics. Originally developed at Coventry University in\n1994, DISCUS site licences have since been purchased by more than 250 schools, colleges\nand universities. Hunt (1996) details the advantages of using spreadsheets in the teaching\nof statistics. The main benefits of DISCUS are:\n\u2022 interactive demonstrations, simulations and dynamic graphics;\n\u2022 opportunities for customization by the teacher;\n\u2022 familiar user interface;\n\u2022 emphasis on concepts rather than techniques;\n\u2022 transparency of the software to students.\nWe both shared some concerns about the limits on learning that were revealed in these\npackages. Separate evaluations were carried out which were aimed at clearly identifying\nthese limits so that there was a sound basis for further development. This revealed a\nnumber of common concerns that needed to be addressed.\nSurface learning\nMuch has been researched and written on the virtues of deep learning (Marton and Saljo,\n1976; Ramsden, 1992). Certain forms of teaching and learning in higher education,\nincluding electronic learning, can tend to push students towards a 'water boatman'\napproach to learning, i.e. skipping over the surface instead of looking more closely at what\nmight lie underneath. Whereas the basic packages did encourage some deeper learning\nthere is a tendency either to make this optional (an economic analysis of the law in parts of\nIOLIS, for example) or not to ask 'hard' questions where such questions might have been\nasked.\nExperience of using DISCUS in teaching revealed a similar tendency to 'click and forget'.\nIt was common for students to 'complete' a whole workbook in a matter of minutes\nwithout having properly engaged with the exercises. This is partly a fault of the exercises\nthemselves, which tend to pose open questions without a unique or concise answer. Hence\nstudents can think they have answered a question without appreciating its full implications.\nHowever, it was always intended that DISCUS would be used in small laboratory classes in\nwhich the teacher would provoke discussion and encourage students to stop and think\nabout their work. Now, with a dwindling staff resource, this is no longer practicable.\nLack of context\nIOLIS deals only briefly with contextual concerns, e.g. the medical context of psychiatric\ninjury. This can tend to rob the topic of its wider meaning (Grantham, 1985) and is part of\nan ongoing debate amongst academic lawyers about the limits of 'black letter' law. Those\n89\nDavid Grontham and Neville Hunt Web interfaces to enhance CAL materials: case studies from law and statistics\nwho argue for law students to know more than just legal principles and rules would find\nIOLIS 'patchy' in its approach to issues involving wider questions than the symmetry, or\notherwise, of legal doctrine.\nIn statistics education it has long been recognized that students learn more from applying\nknowledge to real applications than by dealing with contrived or artificial 'toy' data\n(Singer and Willett, 1990). With the exception of a widely appreciated lottery simulation,\nin DISCUS the emphasis was more on theoretical statistical concepts than practical\napplications.\nUndue seriousness\nIn the experience of both authors there is a truism, frequently neglected in these serious\ntimes, that if you can laugh then the chances are that you will also learn. There is more\nthan a grain of truth in the words of Jack Point, the jester in The Yeoman of the Guard (Act\nI) who says he can 'trick you into learning with a laugh'. If the learning can also be\nentertaining then the chances are it will more readily remain in the mind of the student.\nCertainly, some aspects of law contain their own humour. Law students have little\ndifficulty in remembering the case about the lady who got locked in a lavatory, for example,\nand usually remember with a wry smile the case of the defective coupling. However, whilst\nhaving some of this natural humour, IOLIS does tend to be rather 'flat'. Although\nextremely colourful, DISCUS too suffered from a rather austere approach - heightened by\nthe fact that nobody has ever been known to win the jackpot in the lottery simulation!\nLinking with prior learning\nIt has been powerfully argued that the most important thing about learning is what the\nstudent already knows (Ausubel, Novak and Hanesian, 1978; Entwistle and Entwistle,\n1992). IOLIS tends not to link with any prior learning outside the immediate topic area\nbeing studied, neither does it draw attention to any learning that ought to be embedded\nbefore embarking on new areas of study. Each DISCUS exercise sheet is prefaced by a\n'What you need to know' list, but no resources are provided to cater for a student with a\ndeficiency in this assumed knowledge.\nDialogue and feedback\nIOLIS requires the students to attempt exercises and then provides instant feedback on\ntheir efforts. This certainly meets some of the criteria set out by Laurillard (1993) for\neffective electronic learning environments. What IOLIS fails to do is to identify why a\nstudent may have misunderstood a concept or rule. Thus, the student may go on to get the\n'right answer' but still may not have understood how they got there! Real learning will not\nhave taken place. It has been well argued that that this kind of deep learning can only take\nplace in a truly interactive setting where there is some form of ongoing dialogue between\nthe student and the tutor (Jones and Scully, 1996; 1998). Apart from assessment, such\ndialogue is the best evidence tutors have of the effectiveness of 'the teaching' having\nbecome 'the learning'. Frazer (1992) draws a simple but astute analogy with buying and\nselling:\nNothing is sold until it is bought, and nothing is taught until it is learnt, (p. 55)\nIn DISCUS no feedback is provided for the exercises, rendering it wholly unsuitable for\nself-learning. Indeed, a student may observe a phenomenon in one of the spreadsheets and\n90\nALT-} Volume 7 Number 3\nwrongly conclude that it holds true in all cases, whereas in fact it may only apply to the\nspecial case being considered. As Reinhardt and Loftsgaarden (1979) point out, this is a\nparticular problem with random simulations which, by their very nature, do not always\nshow in a short run the results expected in the long run. Interaction with the package is\ntherefore not only insufficient but potentially dangerous - some interaction with the\nteacher (whether virtual or real) is essential.\nAbility to customize and barriers to collaboration\nOne real drawback of IOLIS is that the developers of the software determine the questions\nfor the students. In the 'real' seminar or tutorial the questions that a particular tutor wants\nto ask his or her students are often highly 'individualized' and matched to the context of\nthe learning situation at the time. An enhanced electronic learning environment should\nallow tutors to tailor questions to their individual preferences. IOLIS does have an\nannotation facility that tutors can use but it cannot deliver either graphics or hypertext.\nDISCUS does allow teachers to customize their own copy of DISCUS. All the exercise\nsheets are provided in electronic form and teachers are given a password to unprotect the\nspreadsheets. However, any changes made to the teacher's copy of the software must\nsomehow be mirrored on all copies of the software held at the institution. Where students\nhave their own copy of DISCUS this is clearly highly inconvenient.\nNeither package allows a team of tutors to collaborate in the design of new, enhanced or\nmore specific, syllabus-relevant, material. In the case of DISCUS, because of the\ncommercial implications, the software developers are reluctant to incorporate new ideas\nand material. Consequently the packages remain globally acceptable but, on their own,\nlocally unsuitable. Moreover, tutors using the software do not have a sense of ownership of\nit, unless they happen to have been the authors or part-authors.\nPotential benefits and problems of Web interfacing\nAfter much debate about the most effective way of enhancing the basic packages, both\nauthors became convinced that a Web interface would allow many of the weaknesses to be\naddressed. Among the perceived benefits of a Web-based approach are:\n\u2022 unbounded multimedia links to thought-provoking sources can provide both the\ncontext and stimulation needed to develop skills of analysis, synthesis, evaluation and\ncritique ('deep learning');\n\u2022 learning can be self-tailored to suit the individual needs of each student - gaps in prior\nlearning may be repaired by following hyperlinks to resources at a variety of levels\n('individualized learning');\n\u2022 choice over sites to be visited, either by following hyperlinks or through 'surfing',\nencourages the student to take more charge of his or her own learning ('autonomous\nlearning');\n\u2022 online discussions (like 'legal forum') allow contributions from all participants,\nespecially from those who would otherwise be reluctant to speak in traditional settings\n('participative learning');\n91\nDavid Gronthom and Neville Hunt Web interlaces to enhance CAL materials: case studies from law and statistics\n\u2022 tutors can take advantage of new electronic sources by linking them directly to Web pages;\n\u2022 material can be easily revised by editing the relevant Web pages without the need for\nnew production runs of disks\/CDs;\n\u2022 learning is not limited in time or place.\nWe could also foresee potential weaknesses in the Web-based learning environment which\nhad to be addressed in the Web page design, although other problems did not really surface\nuntil early pilot evaluations. These could be broadly categorized as pedagogical or\ntechnical. Pedagogical problems can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 some questions may not be suitable for electronic discourse and are better left for face-\nto-face seminars or tutorials;\n\u2022 unless links to other Web resources significantly add value to student learning, students\nwill become frustrated and lose interest;\n\u2022 there is a danger that students will waste study time on visiting irrelevant sites,\nbecoming distracted from the task in hand;\n\u2022 some students may not want to be autonomous and prefer to be 'spoon-fed' with what\nthey believe they need to know - this issue arises with traditional forms of learning and\nneeds to be carefully handled by the tutor,\n\u2022 if online discussions are not carefully managed, both in terms of getting useful student\ncontributions and the timing and nature of tutor interventions, they can easily become\nno more than general chat-shops.\nTechnical problems can be summarized as:\n\u2022 moving to Web-based learning places different demands on campus ICT facilities -\nstudents are likely to spend longer online placing a greater strain on both workstations\nand Internet connections;\n\u2022 it is not easy to create a seamless interface and trouble-free navigation between the\nWeb-based material and the basic package;\n\u2022 links to other Web resources may be unreliable - sites can move or disappear altogether.\nIt was evident to both of us from the outset that it would be impossible to find solutions to\nall these issues at the first attempt. Rather, we resolved to tackle the pedagogical issues and\nsome of the technical matters by means of a 'design and test' approach. Thus two new\npackages were born, IOLISplus (Grantham, 1999) and VOLUME. Both new packages\nwere designed using Microsoft Front Page 98 which builds in navigation between pages\nautomatically and provides a variety of graphic themes for backgrounds, buttons and\nbanners to give pages a consistent look and feel. Additional images, animations, cartoons\nand quotations are used to make the pages light and readable. Also, the packages provide\nnumerous hyperlinks to external sources of relevant materials.\nIOLISplus\nIOLISplus currently comprises 25 Web pages covering three areas of the law of tort\n(general introduction, nuisance and psychiatric injury), although more pages are\n92\nAir-J Volume 7 Number 3\nbeing added as they are designed and tested. The site may be viewed at\nhttp:\/\/home.edu.coventry.ac.uk\/IOLISplus\/. All of these pages are linked directly to IOLIS\nand supplement IOLIS exercises with tutor-generated questions linked directly to the\nrelevant pages of IOLIS. Most of these questions, tailored to the lecture and seminar\nprogramme, require a better understanding of the matters being studied in IOLIS and are\nvery much part of the author's strategy of promoting deeper learning. Students could\neasily 'skip over' these harder questions, of course, but they will inevitably crop up again in\nonline discussions.\nAnimations, flow charts and graphics attempt to add interest and humour so that flat text\ndoes not dominate the page. Graphics are sometimes used as 'picture clues' to help\nstudents remember prior learning or to provide a trigger to understanding a particular\nconcept or issue. Early piloting suggests that animated graphics not only amuse the\nstudents but are also a very powerful medium for learning. Hypertext links to a variety of\nonline resources provide more context for the law being studied, providing a more\ncomprehensive view of the issues involved. In particular, there are now two electronic law\njournals (Journal of Information Law and Technology and Journal of Current Legal Issues)\nwhich have been usefully linked to the appropriate IOLISplus web pages. Decisions of the\nHouse of Lords and the Court of Appeal are now also available on the Internet and these\ntoo have been linked to IOLISplus pages at various points.\nAn area of study in an IOLISplus Web page begins with 'What should already be known'.\nThis lists the essential prior learning required before embarking on the new learning. Of\ncourse, there is no guarantee that the student will check out this learning, but if they get stuck\nin trying to understand new material then they can backtrack to earlier pages in IOLISplus\nor IOLIS. Another feature helping to move the student along is 'Frequently Occurring\nMisunderstandings' (FOMs) which are based on the author's experience of seminar work\nand assessing coursework and examinations. If they wish, a student can quickly navigate to\nthese via hypertext before looking at the rest of the page. Becoming aware of these pitfalls\nbefore intensive study could enable the learner to avoid some of the more well-trodden legal\nbyways and cul-de-sacs. A typical IOLISplus screen layout is shown in Figure 1.\nIf students were to interface between the IOLISplus web pages and IOLIS then a simple\nnavigation system was needed. Having each of the two applications in separate 'frames' on\none screen was tried but this caused problems when IOLIS required the student to\ncomplete an exercise. The whole of the text of the exercise needed to be viewed and this\nwas not always the case. Where multi-choice answers were given then only part of the page\ncould be viewed in the active window so that the student could not see all the available\nchoices. After many messy tries at solving this problem it was decided that the most\neffective solution was to have separate screens, allowing easy navigation by using\nminimizing and maximizing buttons.\nOne of the most challenging design issues was to construct the technical 'how to use the\ntotal package' student guide pages. It meant using a combination of graphics, animations,\nicons and text carefully to take the novice student on a step-by-step journey through the\nprocesses for navigating, minimizing pages and following hyper links to external Web sites.\nAlthough this might look trite to the experienced 'net surfer' it proved a long task to ensure\nthat the instruction was both logical and understandable.\n93\nDavid Granthom and N&rille Hunt Web interfaces to enhance CAL materials: case studies from law and statistics\nS: Tt\u00bbt 1-Netscape\n\u2022pe 45*\nlOLISplus\nSa^M Tort Contents- ; \u201e\nRgraotgneys\nTort 2 ^ ta ^H \u00ab ^ ^ A \u00abi^^b. ^ - rial j * . ^ ^u ^ jf*. . \u00bb\u2022 \\>\nalrcadyhave had this experience botyoovriB be very fortnnatt indeed if you ntanage:-\u00ab)mEli^yo;ram-r.';,:\nneigisiotars; fxommisiaps atworkto dogj iatmgtie postraaa of postmjman,'-Ae tort worid' .'' , i* \" '.*yt'^\ncovers AeioHiange ofiraman experience. ,-'. ^ \" ^ ' \" \u00a3 ' C\nfigure \/: Typical lOUSplus screen layout\nA most significant development has been the creation of a 'legal forum' linked directly to\nthe lOLISplus questions. Included as a facility in Front Page 98 this automatically\nproduces an online discussion area where tutors and students can communicate with each\nother. Stringing together a discussion on a question or topic is also embedded in the\nsoftware so that a student or tutor can follow the development of an argument or response.\nStudents can test out ideas and learning with each other before 'posting' a response to the\n'legal forum'. Tutors can monitor postings and intervene when the discussion is going off\ntask or is simply flagging and in need of more stimulus.\nThe VOLUME package\nThe Web-based version of DISCUS is called VOLUME (Versatile Open Learning Using\nMicrosoft Excel) and can be found at http:\/\/home.edu.coventry.ac.uk\/Volume\/. At the time\nof writing, three of the eight DISCUS units have been developed as VOLUME modules\nfor use over the Web. Each module comprises a series of about five to ten interactive\nspreadsheet-based activities supported by pages of background text material. The pages\nand spreadsheets are all linked to a home page using standard FrontPage navigational\nfacilities.\nUnlike the difficulties faced by lOLISplus, VOLUME benefits from the seamless interface\nthat exists between Microsoft Excel and the Internet Explorer browser.

A standard VOLUME screen layout is shown in Figure 2. Unlike IOLISplus a\nframes layout has been employed on many pages, with the spreadsheet visible in the upper\nframe and exercises in the lower frame.\nVOLUME incorporates background support material on both theory and applications,\nenabling the package to be used for individual study. It also provides links to selected external\nInternet sites which have been subject to prior evaluation by the authors. The sheer volume of\nmaterial now available on the Web means that an important role of the tutor is to seek out\nthose sites which will best supplement - rather than duplicate - existing local resources.\nThe paper-based DISCUS worksheets have been replaced by exercises that require the\nstudent to enter their answers onto an online form. Once an exercise is complete the\nstudent may submit the form and receive instant electronically-generated feedback. The\nFrontPage software automatically stores the submitted answers in a secure directory on the\nserver together with the date, the time, the identity of the user and the location of their\ncomputer. This information is extremely valuable, enabling the tutor to monitor the\nprogress of each student and identify those who are not engaging with this aspect of the\nlearning process. Although the principal aim here is formative self-assessment, in some\nexercises it may be appropriate to withhold the feedback and use the student's responses as\npart of the summative assessment.\nCoventry University has made the generous decision to allow the VOLUME modules to be\nfreely accessible over the Internet. This release from commercial considerations makes it\n95\nDavid Grantham and Neville Hunt Web interfaces to enhance CAL materials: case studies from law and statistics\nmuch easier for the authors to accept contributions from colleagues, both within the\ninstitution and elsewhere, so that the package has the potential to grow almost without\nrestriction. Equally, colleagues have the freedom to write their own Web pages in their own\nstyle and simply include links to selected pages of the VOLUME modules, without having\nto adopt the whole package.\nEvaluation\nA critical component of the action research cycle is the evaluation and review stage of the\nprocess. Sometimes referred to as 'critical trialling' (Davis, 1981) it is the anvil upon which\nthe workpiece (in this case the prototype IOLISplus and VOLUME) is knocked into shape.\nWe had to let our students get their hands on our work and test it for pedagogic and\ntechnical bugs. If these were revealed then, in ICT jargon, they had to be 'fixed'.\nPiloting and evaluation by students of the IOLISplus web pages took place in November\n1998. This worked out quite well since they were about to study psychiatric injury and this\nhad been chosen as the topic for the first IOLISplus pages. Two groups took part, one full-\ntime seminar group (12 students) and one part-time (evening) group (18 students). Something\nof a technical disaster struck the first session. The server could not cope with large numbers\nof students seeking access simultaneously and soon only cached copies of IOLISplus were\navailable. Primitive communication had to be resorted to with the tutor visiting each\nworkstation in turn to check on progress. However, despite this, there was an undoubted\n'buzz' about the groups. Inexperienced 'surfers' had been helped by the 'Web-wise' and there\nwas valuable collaboration at the subject and technical levels. Some of the tutor-set questions\nsparked off an interesting debate on the problems of proving that a psychiatric injury had\noccurred - one student finding time to surf the Internet for the Web site of the American\nPsychiatric Association. Others, having found and read part of a linked electronic journal\narticle, were embroiled in a discussion about the current absurdities in the law. These were\nclear indications that, despite the technical glitches, at an educational level all was well.\nOn investigating the possible reasons for file server failure it was revealed that there were\njust simply too many active hyperlink graphics ('hotspots') on a single page! Drastic\nredesign of the IOLISplus Web to reduce hyperlinks to a minimum resolved the difficulty.\nAnother problem arose when a student wished to go back to an earlier page of IOLIS,\nsince IOLIS pages only number forward! This was subsequently overcome by navigating\nback to the full list of work books on IOLIS and starting again at the beginning of the\nrelevant section or file, but the inexperienced student may find this a hurdle.\nThe second session went far more smoothly with interesting postings to the online\ndiscussion forum, which ran well after a hesitant start. Evidence of deep learning was\nprovided by some students comparing their own personal experiences of accidents and\nsubsequent trauma to the relevant but rather rigid and technical legal rules. Others were\nable to embark on a critique, using an article linked from another Web site. Although the\ntime set for the session passed very quickly, all the students went on well beyond this time.\nWritten feedback using a standard questionnaire was generally very positive and most (90\nper cent of a total of 30 students) found the exercise interesting or very interesting. Only two\nstudents had had initial difficulties with navigation. Opinions on whether they preferred\nelectronic learning or traditional learning split both groups. Five students preferred elec-\n96\nAIT-J Vo\/ume7Number3\ntronic learning, eight preferred traditional learning and ten wished for a combination of\nboth.\nThere were also a number of unforeseen teething problems with the prototype VOLUME\nmodule. An evaluation of initial piloting with students took place in April 1998 and a\nnumber of problems were identified:\n\u2022 Extraordinarily, it emerged that the spreadsheets would only open the first time they\nwere accessed, any subsequent return causing the browser to crash. This was eventually\novercome by placing the navigation buttons on the spreadsheet itself, but some\nproblems remain with apparent conflicts between the server and cache copies of the\nspreadsheet files.\n\u2022 The integration of Excel and Internet Explorer generates many annoying warning\nmessages. In particular, if a spreadsheet contains macros (mini programs), the user is\nwarned that macros may harbour viruses and they should not open the spreadsheet\nunless they are sure it is from a reliable source. In tests students steadfastly refused to\nopen these spreadsheets following the warning. Consequently, wherever possible, the\nspreadsheets have been redesigned so as not to include macros.\n\u2022 It was surprising to discover how much store students set on being able to print out the\nVOLUME pages. The page set-up and colour scheme of the spreadsheets had to be\nadjusted to ensure a clear printout could be obtained.\nDespite these troublesome features student reaction was generally very positive and provided\nan encouragement to proceed with further modules. Several students commented on how\nthey liked to be able to experiment and pose 'What if . . . ' questions, a clear sign that they\nwere engaging well with the module. Students also liked the ability to receive instant feedback\non their responses, unlike traditional assessments where, by the time the feedback is received,\nthe student has forgotten what they submitted! The requirement for students to enter an\nanswer to each question seemed to encourage them to stop and think, rather than 'click and\nforget'. Despite efforts to include more realistic contexts for the statistics, some students\ncomplained that they were not interested in babies, sport, etc. We had deliberately not made\nthe contexts subject-specific, but clearly there is a need to align contexts more with the\nstudent culture. Most gratifying was the common response that 'it was fun', which suggests\nthat students might return voluntarily for a second helping rather than having to be force-fed.\nConclusion\nOur first tentative steps into cyberspace were accompanied by a healthy scepticism and\nmuch uncertainty. However, we are both now far more confident that a carefully designed\nelectronic learning environment has a great deal to offer. It has the potential to address a\nnumber of the current pedagogical concerns, not least of which is providing a learning\nenvironment in which the student can make more sense of the subject. Given the\nappropriate technological infrastructure we both believe that the kind of enhanced\nelectronic learning environment provided by developments like IOLISplus and VOLUME\ncan also address some of the resource issues currently facing higher education.\nTogether with the basic packages both IOLISplus and VOLUME can be used as a total\nlearning environment, as a supplement to a lecture or seminar programme or as a revision\n97\nDavid Grontfiom and Neville Hunt Web interfaces to enhance CAL materials: case studies from law and statistics\nprogramme. Except where students have to learn at a distance we are both certain that\ncontinued face-to-face contact with students is going to be just as important as it has\nalways been. Naisbitt (1984) argues that new technology needs to be balanced by more of\nthe human touch:\nWhenever institutions introduce new technology to customers or employees, they should\nbuild in a high touch component; if they don't, people will try to create their own or\nreject the new technology, (p. 43)\nContinuing resource constraints, however, are likely to reduce contact time, rather than\nincrease it. Enhanced electronic environments allow tutors to reconsider how they best use\nthe available time. We are convinced that some 'mix' of electronic learning and face-to-face\nlearning can produce a really worthwhile student experience in both our disciplines. If\nstudents can master the basic packages and contribute collaboratively and effectively to\nonline discussions, or even just learn from following them, then any subsequent face-to-\nface seminars should be 'quality' time. Matters of particular difficulty or interest can be\nexplored in greater depth than would have generally been possible without prior electronic\nsupport. Whilst it is true that the same kind of prior learning could be had from text\nbooks, lecture notes and other conventional sources it is also true that such preparation is\nnot tailored so specifically to the demands of a particular subject or module. Online\ndiscussions allow a dialogue between students, perhaps in 'action learning sets', and then\nwith the tutor. More challenging topics might persuade the tutor to monitor discussion\nand intervene where students are clearly having difficulty. In our experience, such\ninteractions are rarely found in conventional lectures.\nHowever they, or similar developments, are deployed, the clients of the service (students)\nare likely to be demanding more for their increasing investment in their education. In\nparticular, many of those who have' their own hardware will expect to see modern C&IT\nmethods designed into their courses. Students will tend to spend more of their time surfing\nthe Internet looking for material relevant to their studies. Valuable time can be wasted in\nsuch a search. It is far better that directly relevant and valuable resources should have\nalready been identified by someone who has visited and evaluated these regions of\ncyberspace on a number of previous occasions.\nSoon we hope to pass on what we have learned to interested colleagues in our respective\ndisciplines. Design of Web pages can be undertaken by individuals or by teams of tutors\nwithin the same institution or even by tutors from different institutions who share similar\nlearning aims and objectives. We are very much aware of the importance of creating the\nright conditions for this development and share the concerns of Main (1985) that there is:\na need for openness, co-operation, shared ownership and responsibility as underlying\nvalues for staff development, (p. 115)\nThere is so much scope for individual preference and professional constructive critique in\nWeb page design that at least two or three of these objectives can be satisfied. On the other\nhand, the degree of openness depends heavily on the nature of the relationships between\ncolleagues. However, such collaborative ventures would encourage the embedding of 'best\npractice' as well as extending Web design skills amongst wider groups of colleagues.\nIOLISplus and VOLUME use current technology to create an electronic environment that\n98\nAa-) Volume 7 Number 3\naddresses certain pedagogical issues and tries to provide a worthwhile experience for\nstudents of law and statistics. We have learned much from our adventures in cyberspace\nand how it can relate to our separate but demanding disciplines. Further development and\nevaluation is planned so our own learning goes on.\nReferences\nAusubel, D. P., Novak, J. S. and Hanesian, H.
