They read these texts in order to learn about, and manage, their health \nproblems. These vernacular texts were different from the institutional texts that were \nprescribed to them by their doctors, as well as the commercial  ones that were in the \nliteracy programme they attended. Their uses of these self-help texts reflected the \nstaunchly religious community where they lived, as well as the post-welfare society, with \npressures to solve their own problems. The researcher used ethnographic methods to learn \nabout these issues. These popular materials provided the women with relaxation and \nmeaning, which fit with their communities of practice. The study points to the value of \nknowing about learners\u2018 social practices for policymaking and the importance of \nincorporating these types of texts into programmes. \n \nINTRODUCTION   \nDuring a two-year period, I lived and worked in a town on the island of Hawai\u2018i    \nresearching  the lives and literacy practices of ten mid-life local women (of Hawaiian, \nPortuguese, Japanese, Filipino, Mexican, Chinese, and Causasian ancestry) who attended \na learning  programme in a library. The aim was to learn about the literacy practices that \nemerged from their life histories and their current environments, and then analyse the \ndifferences between these community-based practices, with those institutional ones that \nwere embedded in the many public agencies they encountered (health care, library, social \nservices), and how they negotiated them. Two of the women exemplified many of the \nhealth issues of the other women and they were selected as case studies. Gloria was one \n 2 \nof the women. She viewed her spirituality as imbued in her physical being. She stated,  \n\u2017Us, the body, we\u2018re the church. You\u2018re the church itself\u2026church means we\u2018re sharing, \nwe\u2018re having fun, saying how healthy we were, or, we\u2018re bad time. Maybe we start to \npray. But we have information. Everyone has information if they only could tap on their \ninformation.\u2018 Lourdes, another learner, felt a sense of affinity and safety through reading \nher purse-size Bible to feel protected by God, \u2017\u2026who is always there to help us if we \nask.\u2018 These sources were touchstones for the women, to unearth their cultural wisdom, \ntheir experiential or tacit knowledge, and their emotions, leading them to tune into their \nsymptoms and better survive them. The fact that these women, and others like them, \nturned to these alternative sources, after experiencing failure in the medical system, \nsignaled a need to incorporate alternative perspectives on health and literacy to explain \nhow and why some women learners in Hawai\u2018i confronted their health problems.  \n \n In this article, I first present the general context, the changing landscape of \nHawai\u2018i, where I undertook this research.  Second, I present the critical vernacular  \ntheoretical  frame as a way to explore the women\u2018s complex stories. Third, I present the \nliterature on health literacy which explores the textualised and non-textualised ways in \nwhich adults learn. Fourth, I present the methodology. This is followed by two profiles, \nafter which I present my key findings and undertake an analysis. I end the article with \npractical and theoretical implications for literacy learning.  \n \nCONTEXT OF HEALTH ISSUES IN HAWAI\u2018I \nAt the cusp of the 21\nst\n century, the island of Hawai\u2018i was undergoing tsunami-like \nchanges due to the demise of the sugar industry, causing many people to lose their jobs \n 3 \nand retrain for the service sector, mainly, in tourism and retail. A learning centre was set \nup in the local library to transition people into the new economy, and to teach them \nStandard English, technology skills, and, basic literacy skills. The programme\u2018s emphasis \nrepresented cultural changes since the majority of people on the island spoke Hawai\u2018i \nCreole English (commonly known as, Pidgin). They had few technological  learning \nopportunities, and, they had considerably low literacy levels, according  to state-\ndeveloped  literacy surveys (Berg, 1989; County of Hawai\u2018I, 1995; Omnitrak, 1989). The \nprogramme comprised a mix of English language learners (ESOL), and literacy learners, \nat varying levels, who used the computers in a self-directed way, and were sometimes \ntutored. The curriculum consisted mainly of commercial software and workbooks.  \n \nAt the same time that the pastoral way of life was dying, so was welfare. A new \nnational mantra of  \u2017personal responsibility,\u2018 swept the mainland, and hit Hawai\u2018i  as part \nof the neo-liberal discourse, encouraging  individuals to solve their own problems \nthrough the labour market and increasingly privatised social and human services  (Field, \n2006; Fairclough, 2000; Tomlinson, 2005). Overloaded social workers dropped clients \nfrom their rolls, and, in manipulating the self-determination values of Hawaiians, referred \npeople to newly designed self-help types of job programmes, like the learning centre, \nordering them to improve their skills and opportunities. The few public services, like \nhealth care, were undergoing  intense marketisation, which included introducing more \npaperwork and increasing social distances between  patients and doctors. These trends \nconflicted with traditional Hawaiian and local values of helping and caring for one \nanother (Meyer, 1998; Kelly, Nakamura, & Barrere, 1981). \n \n 4 \nThe local churches, however, transmitted traditional Hawaiian values (like the \nones mentioned previously), seamlessly, by encouraging their congregations to strengthen \ntheir faith. They used oral methods (preaching and counseling on spiritual issues), \ntechnology (advising members to watch and listen to spiritually-based shows) and sacred \ntexts (the Bible). The missionary heritage accounted for why churches have influenced \npublic opinion in Hawai\u2018i\u2018s communities, and continued to do so into successive \ncenturies; early missionaries in the 1800s designed a mass movement to convert all \nHawaiians to Christianity, including training Hawaiians to be ministers, creating  many \nadult education opportunities, and co-opting the Hawaiian language,  turning it into script \n(Kelly, Nakamura, & Barrere, 1981; Salice, 1991). Today, these sacred reading  practices \n(i.e. the Bible) are like \u2017bibliotherapy\u2018 (reading for therapeutic reasons), and significantly \ndifferent from the secular practices of public institutions, like health care facilities, where \nindividuals are expected to read  pamphlets in Standard English, for factual information \n(Rowland, 2000). Also, the oral-based reading of the Bible in churches (Moss, 1994) \nappeals to local culture, and attracts those people with low literacy levels, making  \nreading relevant and accessible (Isaac, Guy, and Valentine 2001; Fitzsimmons, 1991; \nLakes & Lewis, 1990).  \n \nBut there were other reasons for why the churches were popular. The many small \nchurches, some of which were in makeshift sites, were often the centre of social life for \nthe many residents seeking succor from the difficult economic transition, and most of the \nwomen that attended the programme referred to their churches and God, as part of their \nsocial support systems. The churches seemed to emerge in the neo-liberal context, as even \nstronger than before, with their role to preserve Hawaiian and local culture and contest \n 5 \nthe materialism of the new service economy. Ministers preached about the encroachment \nof Walmart, seducing residents to consume foreign goods. Churches were also protective \nof members who lost their welfare, offering them odd jobs, and, encouraging them to \nintegrate into the religious community to receive its many resources (material, emotional, \nsocial, informational). All of the churches\u2018 activities, including its literacy practices, were \npromoted as a way to cope with these changes.  \n \nIf the women\u2018s narratives had not referenced these religious sources so strongly, \nas helping them with their health care, it would have been easy for me, the researcher \n(who was not religious), to write these off as trivial and indoctrinating.  These were \nimportant themes, however, that were illuminated in two women\u2018s stories, as they \nstruggled to learn computer skills, and read, write, and speak Standard English (they \nspoke Pidgin at home and in their communities). The women turned to biblical electronic \nand print sources for healing their bodies, which were seen as infused with spirituality.  \n \nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \n A critical vernacular perspective (a folk and holistic belief systems framework \nthat challenges conventional biomedicine), as defined by Bonnie O\u2018Connor in Healing \nTraditions (1995), was needed to explain the women\u2018s complex stories about their health \nproblems, and the ways they tied in to their literacy practices, cultures, and emotions. A \ncritical vernacular  framework focuses on people\u2018s subjective experiences  of their health \nproblems, and their meaning-making ,  within the context of their cultures, and why they \nmay use alternative therapies for healing (Baumgartner 2002, Courtenay et. al., 1998, \nGreenberg, 2001, Kerka, 2002, Fadiman, 1987, O\u2018Connor, 1989). This framework is also \n 6 \nreferred to as a Health Belief Model (HBM) (Doak, Doak & Root 1996). The HBM \nhighlights people\u2018s belief systems around their health, and how these are affected by their \nrelationships and their interactions around their health; patients and providers are \nconfigured as \u2017sentient actors\u2018 responding to one another in an egalitarian, supportive way \n(Tanner, Benner, and Waerness 1996). This relationship becomes the basis for healing. \nFurthermore, the HBM highlights the interior aspects of healing and the learning that \noccurs in this process (Courtenay, Merriam, Reeves, and Baumgartner  2000).  \n \nThe body, according to this system, is considered holy and communal rather than \nutilitarian and individualistic. Gloria, as we recall, stated, \u2017us, the body, we\u2019re the \nchurch.\u2018 Gloria had a holistic view of health, and viewed categories like, medical, \nbiological, and spiritual, in flexible and relative terms (Ward 1999, p. 204 ). Healing and \nhealth, from this perspective, is viewed as a process, with, small, personal rituals and \nquiet indirect methods.\u2018 (Ward, p. 204). More gentle, subtle therapies may be preferred by \npeople, over invasive or aggressive techniques (Payer 1988). Meditation, herbs, intuition, \nguided imagery and mantras, or communing with nature for treating ailments may be \nrelied on over formalised systems of care that divide mind from body and separate and \nindividualise health problems. From midwifery to magic, women\u2018s health care might \nemulate the practices of mothers and grandmothers and include nutrition, diet, and \nexercise that are undervalued by the medical establishment (Davis and Ingram 1993). It is \ncritical to acknowledge that people may trust alternative sources not within the \nmainstream and that these sources be respected (Adams 1995).  \n \n 7 \nYet they are not respected in many institutions. Hawaii for example, has a long \nhistory of deficit-oriented education for both children and adults, in its neglect for the \nexpertise and knowledge that already exists in the community (Kana\u2018iaupuni 2004). \nHawai\u2018i\u2018s educational institutions have a history of forbidding Hawaiian from being used. \nEven today, many of these institutions (like the library\u2018s learning programme) enforced \nStandard English and forbid Hawai\u2018i Creole English (HCE) from being spoken, even \nthough it was used everywhere in the community. Learners were expected to learn official \nor mainstream (and by virtue, the US mainland) knowledge, with computer-assisted \nsoftware programs and commercial  grammar texts from Texas. In a region like East \nHawai\u2018i, with small, permeable domains, and, a local, shared, working-class culture, \ncommunity-based collaborations could have flourished with learners moving between \nagencies , with their first-languages flowing across boundaries (Jacobsen 1996; Lave and \nWenger 1991, Wilson 1993). Yet this did not occur. Educator Manu Meyer (1998) \nexplains why context is important: \u2017Place matters\u2026. in cultural terms of continuity, \nspiritual purpose, responsibility, and geneology.\u2018 (p. 86). According to Native Hawaiian \nbelief systems, Meyer, elucidates, distinctions between body\/mind  are unseparated from \nknowledge, \u2017liver is where you digest the powers of perception. Digestion is not purely \nphysical. It is an internal digestion. If I have digested a book, I\u2018ve eaten it, digested it \u2017 \n(Rubellite Kawena Johnson, in Meyer 1998, p. 126). Therefore, culture needs to be at the \nfoundation of the curriculum for learning to occur. \n \nLITERATURE REVIEW OF HEALTH AND LITERACY \nA vernacular framework for health fits well with vernacular literacy practices, \nwhich are the ordinary ways people use reading and writing in their local communities for \n 8 \neveryday communication purposes (Papen 2005). The social practice view of literacy \nholds that text-based practices (print and electronic) are indicative of people\u2018s socio-\ncultural contexts and histories, as well as larger social changes taking place in the world, \nlike the globalisation trends previously discussed. Text-based practices, are sponsored by \nvarious institutions and through relations of power. Schools, and other educational \ninstitutions, for example, promote academic literacy, and focus on improving literacy \nskill levels in individuals, so as to increase their economic opportunities. Outside of \ninstitutions, like schools, community members may engage with other forms of literacy, \nwhich are mediated by community members, and for different purposes, ones that are \nmore culturally-based and local.  \n \nThis social practice view of literacy is considerably different from the functional \nform of literacy that is promoted by institutions, like managed care,  and literacy \nprogrammes which consists mainly of quantitatively-based research (Shohet, 2004). The \nsocial practice model, on the other hand, has its roots in ethnographic research on health \n(Robinson-Pant 2004; Papen 2005). Let\u2018s take a closer look at both types of health \nliteracies. \n \nFunctional Health Literacy \nFunctional Health literacy (FHL) is defined as, \u2017the degree to which individuals have the \ncapacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health decisions (Selden et al 2000). It \nmeans being able to read, write, and understand medical and public health texts, like \nprescriptions, signs in hospitals, and doctor\u2018s instructions. First coined in the mid-1970s, \nit has since expanded and become a major agenda in public health and medicine, with \n 9 \npharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, as well as managed care, promoting it. Health \nliteracy is framed as an instrumental, clinical problem to solve through frontloading \nliteracy skills into low-literate individuals, assessing them to determine the best way to \ncommunicate, and lowering the sophistication level of medical texts.  \n \nYet it does not address the patients\u2018 needs, nor, their prior learning and \nknowledge, the authorities they trust, as well as their self-care, and, therapies they already \nuse. The aim is the transmission of bio-medical messages from doctor to patient, not the \nuse of indigenous health resources of the community. Health and literacy are turned into \ncommodities that can be traded on the care market (see, Gee 1996, Baptiste 1998, \nWaerness 1996). The emphasis is on making the patient more compliant so that they will \nadapt to system demands, hence, functional  health literacy. Uta Papen (2006) \ninvestigated health literacy issues in England, and found that health care environments are \nsaturated with texts, which are often difficult for patients to read or understand. She \nrecommends that health care professionals become better mediators of these texts, over \nand beyond providing simple translations or interpretations. Moreover, health care \nenvironments need to be aware of the health care resources in patients\u2018 communities.  \n \nA Social Practice View: Health Literacies \nFrom a social practice view, health and literacy are viewed as part of people\u2018s \nsocial and cultural histories, and the focus is on many types of health-related materials, \nnot medical texts alone. The aim is to remove the \u2017clinical gaze\u2018 of the medical \nprofession, and the diffusion of its messages, and focus instead on the social and cultural \nconstruction of the problem, and the experience of the illness, from the vantage point of \n 10 \nthe patient. Health literacy, would mean being able to handle a range of health messages, \nmanage personal health, and critically analyse the health care system. It would also \nincorporate health care barriers, including, age, gender, class, and race discrimination \n(Hull, Mickulecky, and St. Clair 2003; Nutbeam, 1999).  \n \nMedical ethnographies (Bloor, 2001) contain insights about health literacy issues. \nAnn Fadiman\u2018s study of a Hmong family in the US, dealing with the medical system, \nchronicles their discrimination, and the inability of doctors to accommodate their cultural \nbelief systems about epilepsy. The doctors\u2018 demands for the family to fill out paperwork, \nread prescriptions, interact with them through medical charts, and, record-keeping  were \nunrealistic and even, dangerous. Doctors did not ask the family basic questions, as \nanthropologist, Arthur Kleinmann would have recommended,  like: What do you call the \nproblem? What do you think has caused the problem? Why do you think it started when it \ndid? How severe is the sickness? What do you fear about the illness? The family saw \ntheir daughter\u2018s illness as part of a spiritual malady, and the doctors, with their own \ncultural biases, worsened the problem by forcing treatments that were met with non-\ncompliance. Kleinman warns, \u2017if you can\u2018t see that your own culture has its own sets of \ninterests, emotions, and biases, how can you expect to deal successfully with someone \nelse\u2018s culture?\u2018 (in Fadiman 1997, p. 261). Miscommunication is a common theme in \nthese medical  ethnographic studies. Over and beyond miscommunication, Anna \nRobinson-Pant (2001) conducted a study of women in a health literacy course in Nepal. \nShe found that women learners resisted the values embedded in the course content, and \ntheir attitudes went unchanged because it did not fit with their cultures. The course \ndesigners did not understand the women\u2018s uses of literacy in the community, nor, their \n 11 \nhealth belief systems. The family planning focus was interpreted by the women as causing \nproblems between themselves and the other women in the family and the issue was \nconsiderably more complex than the aim of the course content. The women only gained \nconfidence in learning to sign their names, but did not adopt western practices of health. \nThese studies illustrate the different health care trajectories of patients and medical \nprofessionals, and the importance of matching cultural contexts and communication \npreferences of patients so that their health care problems can be addressed in appropriate \nways. The social practice literature on health fit well with the ways that the women in this \nstudy healed themselves, as they used alternative sources that were inextricably linked to \ntheir cultures, contexts, and, communities. \n \nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY \nAn ethnographic approach was used to study the women\u2018s experiences of health \nand their learning inside and outside of a literacy programme in a local community \n(Barton & Hamilton, 1998). This approach revealed rich information about the women\u2018s \nreading, and its connection to their health, with their frames of references and values, all, \nin the context of rapid social change. \n \nData Collection  (Techniques) \nI used a Hawaii-based interviewing technique, called, \u2017talk story\u2018 to hear the \nwomen\u2018s stories in their first language, from their viewpoints, and in an open-ended way. \nTalk story is a favored communication form among local people in Hawai\u2018i, and other \nresearchers have used this technique to get the \u2017insider perspective\u2018 (Briggs, 1996; \nTaosaka 2002, Lebra 1991, Kneubuhl 1996, Salice 1991). I lived in Hawai\u2018i for three \n 12 \nyears prior to the study, and understood Hawai\u2018i Creole English and how to use talk story. \nTalk story encompasses loosely structured interviews with local people that allow for \ntheir stories to emerge about everyday topics like food, health, and work. I explored these \ntopics in my interviews with the learners and also talked to the their tutors and the staff \nabout what they knew about the women\u2018s lives and learning. Additional interviews with \ncommunity literacy educators and social service counselors expanded my perspectives on \nthe ways institutions had recently changed and became more textualised, or paper-based \n(Barton & Hamilton, 2005).  \n \nI conducted  five life history interviews with each women over a period of a year. \nThese interviews focused on many different aspects of their lives, including their \neducation and work histories, about their learning and communication in their families, \nand the mass media they used in their daily lives. The women were also observed outside \nof the program, which included going to church and attending other community events \nwith them. Inside the programme, I examined their work folders, and observed them \nlearning with their tutors, in small groups, and by themselves. Documentary analysis of \nliteracy program materials, community historical records, and environmental and \ncommunity print, in conjunction with photography supplemented the interviews. Finally, I \nimmersed myself in the community for two years as a teacher and community member, \nand lived with a local family, all of which were indispensable for learning about how \ntexts fit into the women\u2018s way of life.  \n \nData collection  (Respondents) \n 13 \nGloria was a Hawaiian women, a widow, in her early 50s who grew up on the \nisland and had dyslexia and a severe case of asthma. When she learned that her welfare \nwould be cut off (because her doctor would not claim she had dyslexia), she started \nattending the learning  programme in order to raise her literacy skills enough to apply for, \nand keep a job. She struggled to read texts in the programme that she had never before \nencountered in her work life on pineapple, macademia and coffee plantations and \nfactories, in caring for family members, or in her social life, where she sang and \nvolunteered at church. Although she was classified at an entry level of literacy, she read \npopular religious materials at a much higher level, because  she considered  them to be \ntherapeutic and knowledgeable.  \n \nLourdes, also in her early 50s, and originally from Mexico, lived in Hawai\u2018i for \nover 20 years, was married to a local Hawaiian man, and raised her children there. While \nshe had many jobs in her past, including papaya grading and sewing aloha shirts, she was \ncurrently a therapeutic aide in a nursing home. The company recently merged with \nanother one, and with her new position, she was expected to submit weekly reports of her \nactivities. She attended the learning  programme in order to improve her writing skills in \norder to meet these work demands. In addition to having to write these difficult texts, she \nalso struggled to read her doctor\u2018s reports, and experienced great distrust of the system, \ndue to consenting to a hysterectomy that she later discovered was unnecessary. She had \nsome depression related to this, and her menopause, and she relied on a slew of popular \nreligious and self-help texts that were at much higher levels than her classification in the \nprogram (an ESOL level 2). Like Gloria, she used both print and electronic sources. She \nwatched a nun on television who comforted her and reminded her fondly of her girlhood \n 14 \ndays in Mexico. She also attended church, and like, Gloria, would be considered deeply \nreligious, often praying by herself, and, referring  to many daily problems as God\u2018s will.  \n \nData Analysis \nI used a narrative analysis technique to capture the women\u2018s unique stories about \nhealth, and then profiles were created from these narratives, which are presented in this \narticle. The narrative approach (Gluck and Patai 1991, Riessman 1993, Witherell & \nNoddings 1990) complemented the talk story method, and lent the women voices to \n\u2017story\u2018 their uses of texts for healing. The narrative analysis also highlighted the women\u2018s \ndecision-making, and their evaluations about their health problems in the context of their \ndaily lives. \n \nThe narratives were then formulated into profiles of their vernacular texts for \nhealing in the context of Hawai\u2018i. Profiles (Seidman 1991) offer opportunities to see \nnuanced processes and how events unfold under special circumstances, in this case, two \nwomen and their uses of health texts. I also cross-compared the individual profiles to \nunearth major themes, one of which was the social literacy practices of health and healing \n(to be discussed in the findings section). \n \nA PROFILE OF LOURDES: \u2017AND I REMEMBER FEELING VERY UNCOMFORTABLE ON \nTHAT\u2018 \n \nAlthough Lourdes had a hysterectomy, she was surprised at having menopausal \nsymptoms, \u2017I didn't know it was that. Cause for one thing I had a hysterectomy. So I didn't \n 15 \nexpect so much changes. I used to feel real lonely like. Real lonely you know. Nothing. \nEverything was the same. It\u2018s just the feeling in your head.\u2018 She recalled how she felt \nabout her changing body, which led her to get a book from the library, called,  The Silent \nPassage, mentioned by a co-worker.  She said, \u2017Well for instance, I didn't know any \nsymptoms. Nobody ever told  me what you're gonna feel. Like now. I finished. I finished \nyea and I didn't know anything. I was what, forty-four year old and I was going crazy you \nknow. You feel like you're going crazy. And I didn't know what's going on. Somebody \ntold me, go to the library and get a book.\u2018 Although this book would be considered far \nabove her programme level, she read it, and even transmitted this information to other \nwomen co-workers. She recalled, \u2017and then we start talking and then we find out we have \nthe same feeling.\u2018  In many respects, Lourdes took care of her needs by giving voice to \nthis \u2017silent passage\u2018 and passed on the knowledge to other women who exhibited similar \nsymptoms. She also informed herself of her Premarin medication, which her doctor didn\u2018t \ntell her about, through the help of a pharmacist who noticed that she was anxious. She \nrecalled:  \u2017He said, oh you're so . . you look very anxious. Anxiety or you know--I \ncouldn't sit still. Or, and then I told him what is this for? And then he told me what the \nPremarin for. It's a hormone. And then he gave me the paper. A long paper like this. He \nsaid read this. I didn't know what I was taking.\u2018 Lourdes trusted the doctor who gave her \nthe prescription, and she took the medicine without knowing what it was for six months. \nShe remembered,  \u2017Cause when I went to the doctor, he didn't tell me. He gave me the \nPremarin and he said take this and you feel better. And I remember feeling very \nuncomfortable on that. I didn't ask him why. Or nothing. I just thought, well you're the \ndoctor.  You're supposed to know better.\u2018 After the pharmacist explained the purpose of \nthe medication and its side-effects, she told the doctor, \u2017I don't need this.\u2018 She then began \n 16 \ntaking vitamins instead of hormonal supplements because she believed they were \u2017good.\u2018 \nThe meanings of her health care and how she managed it through power struggles, \ninformal advocates, reading for meaning, critical questioning, alternative health \nsupplements, prayer, and conferencing  are not captured in the functional health literacy \nliterature. Neither are the ways she knew her symptoms through experiential knowledge \nas opposed to literacy discourses and formalised instructions by doctors. \n \nLourdes said, \u2017not forget, forgive\u2018 about this traumatic experience.  This \nmetaphor, of forgiving but not forgetting, reflected her sacred beliefs and cultural \nknowledge that she drew on in her decisions about her health and as it intertwined with \npower relations, spirituality, self-care, and emotions in her daily life. The self-\nimprovement and spiritual readings that she used healed her in ways totally different from \nthe health work she did in her health aide position, or, in the reading involved in taking \npills. She used this literature for comfort, for self-assertion, and healing as well as being \nan authority to co-workers about menopause. She often read the Bible at all hours of the \nday, and she regularly read, \u2017pick me up prayer\u2018 books too. She said,  \u2017Pick me up, and \nit\u2018s like if I do a lot of things for somebody, then something goes wrong,  I remember \nwhat that book says.\u2018 In addition, she listened to biblical tapes which helped reinforce her \nfaith, and belief that \u2017God was watching over\u2018 her.  Rodriguez (1994) studied the ways \nMexican-American women develop their strength and heal themselves and others through \nstrong female imagery. The provocative image of the nun Lourdes watched every night on \nTV referenced \u2017Our Lady of Guadalupe\u2018 for the comfort, devotion and inspiration which \ninfused her work and home relations. The readings supported these purposes too: \n \n 17 \nSo I pray and pray and then it's like somebody just open the door . . . . \n yea it's better than fighting . . .  try to forget I guess. Forgive and \nforget . . . .  yea,  because that's what I forgive. Takes time, but it's \npossible. Not forget, forgive. You know before I go to bed I listen \nevery night to channel 19. I don't know if you get the channel. A \nreligious channel. It's a Catholic channel. They have this nun. Mother \nAngelica. It on at 10 every night--- I listen to her. Because she talks \nabout God. People call in with problems and she tell them what to do \nor where to go. \n \n This mantra was constantly reinforced through her mass media practices, which \nreconnected her to her inner self and her past life--propelling her to the next stage of \nlearning. The self-improvement books she bought and borrowed, and heard from the TV \ncelebrity, Oprah and a nun reinforced the cultural knowledge that she obtained in her \nformative years in Mexico with her evangelical family. \n \nHer knowledge about healing, transformation and inspirational figures clashed \nwith her negative experience of a doctor who quickly diagnosed her, showed her a picture \nof a uterine tumor, had her sign papers, and gave her a hysterectomy. She recalls, \u2017So he \nset everything up quick. I sign the paper and I went surgery. Said oh boy. But now I'm \nolder and wiser\u2026.I wouldn\u2018t have. I would never have surgery.\u2018 She knew that by asking \nfor alternative help, even reading magazines, and through television, she could get \ninformation that would help her in the future. This experience made her distrust the \ndoctor\u2018s judgement and left her distrustful of the system in later encounters with doctors. \n 18 \nEventually, she chose not to reject something that she saw as a natural occurrence, \u2017it\u2018s a \nnatural thing to happen to every woman. Why fight it? Just let it go.\u2018  These sources gave \nher a sense of control that she had previously lost.  \n \nIt could be argued that Lourdes\u2018 lack of faith in the health care system made her \ncynical and entrenched her faith in alternative healing.  For example, at work, she was \ndevoted to patients, and said \u2017I love old people,\u2018 but she constantly had to \u2017pass meds and \nboss people around.\u2018 She also had to \u2017say something on paper\u2018 every week and report on \nher patients as if she was studying, rather than caring , for them. She relied on her prayer \nbooks and other self-help literature for self-assertiveness at work, and to be in touch with \nher needs and emotions to care for herself and for others. She said, \u2017the first book I read-- \nI'll never forget it. Was back in 19, maybe 1981, was with Norman Vincent Peale, the \npositive thinking. Oh that book was good. So from then on I start, you know, in my \nhead I can do it.\u2018  These books helped made her feel independent, go back to work and \nnot, \u2017listen to my husband too much. I have my own mind, why should I listen to him?\u2018 \nShe also used these books to assert herself on the job. Lourdes used these popular texts as \nreplacements for institutional measures.  \n \nA PROFILE OF GLORIA: \u2017WITH WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE, THERE\u2018S GREAT \nSORROW\u2018 \n \nGloria discussed how she came to terms with adult onset-asthma: \u2017Cause, you \nknow, with wisdom and knowledge, there\u2018s great sorrow. That\u2018s in the Bible. With \nwisdom and knowledge. Because you see the person and they\u2018re screaming, and you \n 19 \nknow how to get them out of the situation \u2026It took me a whole year to settle down. It \ntook me another year to say yes, it is [asthma]. And then this year I finally said, OK, I \nadmit it, and now I know.\u2018 Gloria received factual information from her doctor about \nasthma, which she then interpreted it into something she related to, like, biblical \nteachings,  eating correctly, and acknowledging she was ill\u2014something that was not part \nof her identity, as she had previously been very healthy. She interpreted the doctor\u2018s \nadvice to fit with her own knowledge system: \u2017So its like, OK, now, say I\u2018ve got a \nproblem with my health. Which I had. Because it\u2018s reality. Everybody don\u2018t want freezer \nfood. They want facts\u2026 So, it\u2018s in my body system. And then the second thing is, \u2017What \nyou put in is what you get out.\u2018 So if I put in like, negative words, negative come out. If I \nput good food in, good food\u2014your body will function.\u2018  \n \nTurning to the Bible, in print and electronic forms (tapes and software), allowed \nher to be in touch with her body\u2018s signs and depend more on herself, \u2017I put the Bible tapes \non cause when I couldn\u2018t read, then I usually trust everyone.\u2018 She went on to discuss the \nimportance of biblical values of moderation for dealing with the asthma. This  was taught \nto her through an icon of a bumblebee devouring honey on her Bible software \nprogramme. Tuning into her symptoms, and learning about them, was critical to her \nhealth care. She said, \u2017I didn\u2018t know how to be sick. I have to learn the symptoms.\u2018 For \nGloria, learning the symptoms meant recognising her emotional states: \u2017With wisdom and \nknowledge, there\u2018s great sorrow\u2018 she said. \n \nGloria also knew about using her mental and spiritual powers of healing through \nher experience of caring for family members. Taking care of her ill mother and husband \n 20 \ngave her a strong sense self. But it was much work. She recalled, \u2017 cause he [her husband] \nwas going to die pretty soon, eventually and my mom was dying of cancer. So, that\u2018s \nwork cause you have to discipline your mind to be strong.\u2018 Gloria viewed taking care of \nher own body as work. She had to chart her breathing and deal with the side effects of the \nmedicine which didn\u2018t feel natural to her self-image. She described her asthma as a, \n\u2017monster\u2018 especially when the doctor was not following up on her self- reports of her \nsymptoms. She said, \u2017I still don\u2018t feel well and  I told my doctor that, so we haven't really \nlooked into it. And I haven't really pursue[d] it, cause I wasn't ready to face anything \nelse\u2026.so now that  I'm a little strong to face the monster,  I\u2018m not afraid now,  so when I \nhave to talk it,  that\u2018s work.\u2018 \n  \nGloria was scared about how to handle her asthma. It felt out of control and the \ndoctor was not alleviating it. Her constant battle around the steroids that he gave her, and \nwhether or not it was really helping, made her feel like caring for herself was emotional \nwork because her \u2017body lets me know who is boss\u2018 and the doctor was not \u2017God; \u2017 What\u2018s \nmore, the doctors depended on her to name the symptoms, which created more stress \nbecause they were hard to articulate. She explains: \n \n I [am] trying to get this asthma thing under control. And one minute, it seems like \nit is under control and then all of a sudden it flares up again\u2026. But I thought I'd \ntry to go on 5 miligrams  of that steroid.  And every time I kind of take one step \nlower, my body lets me know who is boss and it\u2018s it. It won't listen to me even \nthough how much I beat it up\u2026. and it takes a lot of work just to keep healthy. It \ntakes a lot of work to stay still. Keep yourself calm.  Talk to yourself, relax. Even \n 21 \nif your body will not pay attention. So that\u2018s\u2018 work. That\u2018s a lot of work, \nespecially emotional, cause you taking the medication and it\u2018s not listening.  And \nit\u2018s not the doctor\u2018s fault. It\u2018s learning what your body can handle and what it can \nnot handle.  And that\u2018s what I told my doctor. I said, he's not God.  \n \n Gloria attempted to heal herself and pay more attention to her emotional states, \nwhich was critical her health care. This was especially the case because feeling anxious \ntriggered her asthma episodes. Part of her healing encompassed trusting a higher force (a \nGod) which calmed her down and gave her a feeling of control and relaxation. Her books \nbecame \u2017a study tool\u2018 which was solacing. She said: \u2017This is what the pastor said, when \nyou\u2018re reading, it\u2018s like a love letter\u2026.So the Bible is actually a love letter.  And he [is] \ntelling you what\u2018s taking place in the world.\u2018 \n \nComing to the literacy programme was difficult for Gloria because the dust and \nmold in the building aggravated her condition, and it was exacerbated by the stress of her \ncase worker pressuring her to raise her skills quickly in order to find a job. It didn\u2018t help \nthat she discovered, upon entering the programme, that she was at an entry level of \nliteracy and it would take much longer to achieve the case worker\u2018s goals. It also didn\u2018t \nhelp that she felt she had a disability, dyslexia, which no one seemed to acknowledge or \naddress seriously. The fact that her doctor denied, on paper, that she was not dyslexic and \ncould engage in paid work (instead of just receiving welfare) demoralised her. She used \nfood to comfort her when she felt pressured and sick, but this strategy was to no avail. \nTaking care of herself felt like a daunting task in light of all of the demands placed upon \n 22 \nher. While poi, a Hawaiian food, was normally what she liked to eat to comfort herself, \nshe tried to relax with other food instead one night. She recalled: \n \nI started to cry. And I didn\u2018t cry, oh gosh I'm only in the 4th grade level [of \nliteracy]. Then I thought, I have to go to work. They pushing me there, the welfare \npeople. They said they got to hunt for work and I'm not well. And I have to go to \nwork. How am [I] gonna work this out\u2026.Like you don\u2018t know what is sick. I \nthought, maybe if I had sardine and wine. I love sardine. And I'll eat it away.  I'll \neat my food and this sickness will go away. So at 11 at night I'm eating my food-- \nrelax Gloria,  its only in your mind. You need your job. Welfare [is] not going to \nhelp you. Got to get going now girl. So I end up in the hospital for a week and I \nwas laid up for a whole month\u2026. So that was very hard, you know. And it\u2018s still \nreally hard.  And I\u2018m not told, disability.  I have one disability. And right this very \nminute I feel pressured to go to work. \n \n Under these circumstances, of having few economic resources, pressures to work \nand learn in a literacy programme, exacerbated  by little help from her doctor and all of \nthose around her, she felt her body and life were out of control. Viewing her body as part \nof a congregation or \u2017church\u2018 allowed her to re-attach herself to the world in a safe, \ntrusting way which was sanctified by spiritual purposes, and connected her to a \nsupportive community of people.  \n \nFINDINGS  \n 23 \nHealth care arose in formidable ways in Gloria and Lourdes\u2018 stories, representing \nmany of the women\u2018s stories and highlighting it as a major theme in my research. The \nwomen had health problems that included asthma, back pain, cancer,  thyroid problems, \ndepression, and, they also cared for ill family members. The women told the researcher \nabout how doctors advised them through print formats, brief oral consultations, pills, and \nsurgeries. Yet, they often turned regularly to biblical teachings, spiritual counselors, \nprayer, and other alternative therapies. Their engagement with these sources allowed them \nto become attuned to their symptoms, learn about their bodies, and manage their illnesses, \nin the best ways they could. Yet these opposing health discourses were in conflict for the \nwomen as they struggled to improve their health care and learn literacy but with little help \nfrom the experts to whom they initially turned. \n \nGloria, for example often turned to poi (a Hawaiian staple), other local foods, and \nherbs to cope with her asthma condition, as well as reading the Bible. She did this \nbecause she saw her body and her spirituality as inseparable. She said, \u2017I always say one \nbuilding is the lungs. One building is the heart. One building is the liver. . I am in this \nchurch right this very minute\u2026.and if we all come together, we need each other.  Cause \nwe make partner, the body.\u2018 These rituals were supported by her community, but were not \nresponses that her doctor understood or supported.  \n \nLike Gloria and Lourdes, other women learners who were interviewed trusted \npopular culture materials for their health care. There was Margaret, who used Jehovah \nWitness magazines as alternative sources for health-related concerns. Another learner, \nRosalia, read fitness magazines and power walked with a co-worker. There were many \n 24 \nother examples of women who embraced alternative health modalities and vernacular \ntexts for dealing with their health problems. These women\u2018s alternative responses to their \nhealth, and their literacy uses, contradicted the conventional biomedical literature they \nwere given in health care facilities, which focused on knowing medical facts, as well as \nthe literacy programme library which held a small amount of conventional health care \ninformation. This literature was meant for individual use. Yet neither of the women \nnavigated their problems alone. Instead, both women used mediators, or, sponsors to \nlearn about their health (Brandt, 2001; Cuban, 2003). Gloria was close to her minister and \nhis wife, to other congregation members, and she also had a \u2017spirit man\u2018 who guided her \nalong her therapeutic journey. Lourdes watched a Catholic nun on TV, and read her \nreligious and new-age self-help books and shared them with others. They both used these \nsacred materials to work on their emotional problems that were related to their physical \nconditions, and viewed these activities as health promoting. These sources also \ncompensated for the gaps left by their doctors (who requested their patients to fill in \nforms rather than spending the time to listen and deeply understand their problems).    \n \nThe women saw their bodies, feelings and spiritual needs as integrated with their \nhealth, and not discrete and mechanised. Gloria, for example, called, it,  \u2017a body system\u2018 \nof \u2017knowledge and wisdom.\u2018 These popular sources were catalysts for the women in \ncoping with their problems, but more importantly, for viewing their life experiences and \npersonal development. This type of reading seemed to bring the women closer to knowing \nand learning about their symptoms, especially when they were validated by other \nauthorities in their communities. This issue is critical in practical ways, because if doctors \ndepend on women to describe their symptoms accurately, it is essential that women be \n 25 \nsensitised to their bodies and emotions. These reading sources reinforced their \nexperiential knowledge  of their problems, and, in a sense, became diagnostic tools to \nunderstand their health (Polanyi 1998, Rapp 1997).  \n \nPRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH \nLITERACIES  \nPractical  Implications  \nReading for emotional purposes not for pre-processed facts, may be more \nbeneficial in diagnosis and treatment, especially in the case of certain problems. The \nfunctional health literacy formula of upgrading literacy learners\u2018 skills so they can read \nhealth care texts, or, turning all health care texts into Plain Language  (easily readable),  \nare only superficial solutions for the complex problems of women like Gloria and \nLourdes. Literacy programmes can encourage learners to discuss their health problems in \na safe environment rather than simply recording these in a log as barriers to attendance. \nThese discussions can be in the form of learning circles, where there is no head of the \ntable, and everyone takes turns sharing their issues and forming networks to offer support \nthat extend beyond the literacy programme and into the community.  \n \nYet, learning circles go beyond just offering emotional support, and they have \nsocial value too. They offer learners the opportunities to be advocates and community \nhealth leaders. People collectively engage with, analyse, and seek solutions, using and \ndeveloping community resources. Lyn Tett (2003) studied a health community course of \nwomen learners who took collective action to change conditions in their community to \nproduce greater health outcomes. One of these was housing. Working together, the \n 26 \nwomen began to see that their housing and health issues were not isolated incidences or \nprivate issues, and that were connected to each other. Through advocating collectively, \nthey campaigned for, and got, better housing amenities.  \n \nConferencing strategies (between learners and staff or tutors and learners or \nlearners with one another) offer focused opportunities to share information and develop \nsolutions to problems. It also gives staff and tutors opportunities to understand how \nlearners understand and make decisions about their bodies, what sources they use, \nespecially other community members they consult with, acknowledges a collective view \nof health care (Fadiman 1997, O\u2018Connor 1995). These long dialogues can occur in intake \nsessions where there are opportunities to advise and gain information on both sides. Much \nof this can be gathered by learning about women\u2018s life stories and creating narratives of \ntheir experiences .  \n \nOnce this information is known, the curriculum can address learners\u2018 health \nexperiences, their vernacular health practices, and the health mediators they use in their \ncommunities. Using an engaged  curriculum (Boudin 1983, hooks1994, Hohn 1997)  \nincorporates women\u2018s experiences and expressiveness, aiming for an education that is \nsocially transformative. This health literacies curriculum addresses women\u2018s collective \nsenses and interpersonal reasoning around health care (Witherell  and  Noddings 1990) \nthat may be beneficial in naming and treating problems holistically.  \n  \nFinally, without acknowledging the importance of health literacy policies, changes \ncannot occur. Currently, government policies support the functional health literacy \n 27 \nparadigm described above (Rudd, 2002), rather than the social practice perspective. The \nbasic skills agendas of most industrialized countries\u2018 adult basic education systems is \nfunctional, with a focus on knowing mainstream vocabulary in order to pass tests. Also, \ncurrent funding structures support the spread of functional health literacy in adult basic \neducation; Pfizer, for example, is a major supplier of health literacy grants. Another \nmechanism for the influence of functional health literacy are the many regulations in \nhealth care facilities that produce massive amounts of paperwork for patients to read, \nmaking the case for FHL advocates to teach functional health literacy in programmes.  \nGreater policy interventions are needed to insure wider access, support structures, and \nopportunities for health literacies (from people\u2018s communities) to flourish.  \n \nTheoretical Implications \nThe mainstream health clinics where the women went for their health care \ncompartmentalised their health problems and did not recognise the standards they used to \nperceive their health, their native ways of knowing (Bouscouvalas, 1993) nor their \n\u2017lifeworld systems\u2018 (Welton 1993).  This phenomenon was largely due to cultural and  \nsocial class discrimination.  But it was also related to gender discrimination, and the \ndismissal of women\u2018s \u2015embodied accounts of the truth\u2016 (Haraway, 1991 p. 186). The \ninsider\u2018s perspectives, according to Donna Haraway, should be distinguished from expert \nstances. As women tell their stories, their local knowledges and \u2015webbed accounts\u2016 \n(Haraway, p. 194) are highlighted through their power relations, bodies, habits, and \nmaterial circumstances (Hartsock, 1987; Lamphere, Ragone, & Zavella, 1997; Sachs, \n1996). Yet these knowledges are invisible within the mainstream medical  establishment. \nFurthermore, women are given few opportunities to confront the medical establishment as \n 28 \npart of their healing and transformational development (Brooks, 2000). For this reason, it \nwould be important to expand the critical vernacular framework to generate a broader \nrange of explanations about marginalised women\u2018s health literacy practices and \nexperiences.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nTo summarise, the women\u2018s acceptance of alternative modalities, like these \npopular texts, were mediated by their ethnic backgrounds, gender, and generation (Sachs, \n1996), and was carried into the present in a semi-rural area that lacked medical options, in \nconjunction with increased managed care, and during an era of welfare reform. The \nlegendary missionary heritage that was imprinted and transmitted by the many small \nchurches, through local culture, also influenced their practices.  \n \nThe women\u2018s ingenious practices offered a window into the cultural, community-\nbased strategies they used to heal themselves which were not supported by the \nprogramme they attended nor the services to which they initially turned to for help. Yet \nthey did obtain alternative resources in their communities to help them cope with their \nhealth problems and they strategically used them. As the study demonstrated, little cross-\nover existed between the local community and its institutions, and more mediators of \nliteracy were needed by the women to bridge these gaps and provide diverse resources. \nMoreover, as the women\u2018s stories suggest, learners need more than bridges, but, \nadvocates for their greater self-determination and educational aspirations. They need to \nsee both social and educational  systems (health care facilities and literacy programmes) \nas allied with them, rather than as distant authorities; as Gloria stated, \u2017us the body\u2019 and \n 29 \n\u2017we make partner, the body.\u2018 Through these connections, communities can transform \nthemselves into  \u2015therapeutic landscapes\u2016 (Gesler, 1992) that foster dynamic, holistic \nways that people use literacy and seek information for healing.   \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nAdams, D.
