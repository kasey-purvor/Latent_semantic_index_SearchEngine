This paper is nevertheless more concerned with other variables of language learning and teaching\nwhich the author considers fundamental to reach a successful degree of language use.\nIntroduction: the nature of the project\nThe project originally started in January 1994 and involved the creation of an email-based\ninteractive Italian-speaking community (ISC) in the form of a discussion list ('Due chiacchiere\nin amicizia'). It was initially limited to on-campus learners of Italian or 'real' Italians. When\nthe project started, the aims were:\n\u2022 to provide online support for students who needed extra help in the learning process;\n\u2022 to support learning motivation through one-to-one communication with the tutor;\n\u2022 to provide the opportunity for additional language practice;\n\u2022 to encourage students to reflect on both the language process and content;\n\u2022 to provide a 'special niche' where learners from different nationalities, backgrounds and\nexperiences could 'meet' with Italians and have the opportunity to explore the socio-cultural\ndimension.\nThe first period was left very open to permit familiarization with the use of email (not\neverybody was a regular email user). I provided short texts to be read, containing particular\n40\nVolume 4 Number I\ngrammatical points, and produced language exercises (gap filling, multiple choice questions,\nquestion and answer, etc.). The Italian contribution varied from participation in story-writing\nactivities to riddles to solve and questions to answer. Initially, I selected topics which were\nrelevant to what the learners were doing in class (Europe and being European, past\nexperiences, holidays, politics, reasons for learning Italian, etc.). Occasionally, I suggested\nsome Web sources (other discussion lists, newsgroups, etc.) where they could learn more about\ncurrent affairs or cultural issues, or keep up to date with the reality of their country.\nAlthough the participants responded positively to the activities - as reflected in a substantial\nincrease in the number of messages after the first three weeks - 1 sensed that the reaction was\nmore from a sense of duty than from genuine interest. Apart from the story-writing activities\nand the riddles which they liked, the learning environment was not leaving enough space for\n'meaningful communication' (see Brown, 1980; and Halliday, 1985). The first four of the five\naims mentioned above were satisfactorily achieved by the project as it stood. However, the\ncreation of a real interactive community with its own dynamics was far from being achieved. It\nresembled closely a replica of communicative teaching techniques on screen. The influence of\nthe teacher (myself) was too evident, and this showed in the formality of some messages and\nthe type of requests.\nIn January 1995, membership was therefore opened to other learners of Italian and Italians\nglobally. Absolute beginners were allowed to join in as silent participants and when - or if -\nthey felt ready, they could give their profile or ask for clarifying questions. Consequently, the\nISC became more diverse. Membership included Canada, Spain, America, Germany, France,\nIreland, Brazil and Poland, to mention only some, while the 60 or so members (gained in the\nfirst six months) were equally mixed in terms of age, sex and occupation, and included the\nparticipation of two blind students. For these latter members, email represented a\ncomparatively simple, economic and less discriminatory system which allowed them to\ncommunicate with the rest of the world. Because their world already contemplates a different\nvisual dimension, the 'cluelessness' of email put everyone in the same position. While in a\nface-to-face situation, they may have been disadvantaged by the use of visual clues; in this\n'blind' communication, the only clues were coming from within the texts. As an active\nmember commented: 'Email gives me the chance to be heard for what I have got to say,\nregardless of my appearance'.1 As a matter of fact, the two blind participants played a very\nactive role in stimulating discussions.\nA group dynamics developed, the shape of the messages changed, the tone relaxed, the\nmessages became longer, and the language style more adventurous. The relationship between\nthe participant, the others and the screen became strongly directed by the individual's agenda\nand satisfaction of perceived needs, interests and wants. One student noted that he would rather\nspend more time discussing issues on Italian life and culture than go to lectures which had no\nbearing in his real daily life. Another pointed out that 'it was not discussing for the sake of\nlanguage learning'. The exchanges became more meaningful and carried the richness of the\nindividuals' identities. In some cases this meant diverting discussions from Italian-related\ntopics to more personal concerns about the world and the way things were going, their\nexperiences of cultural shock, and political and social beliefs.\nThe next stage was the request by a participant to forward to the ISC a brief personal\nintroduction which could allow the rest of the group to empathize with their fellow learners.\n41\nMarina Mozzon-McPherson Italian via email: from an online project towards a multi-cultural discourse community\nThe creation of a folder containing all these profiles proved an important step. This file was\ngiven to all new ISC participants on joining. The personal profiles helped to create lines of\ninterests, and allowed the integration of new meanings and recognition of a new set of beliefs,\nmaking sure that the wit and irony of certain participants could not be misunderstood. This can\nbe clearly illustrated by the incident I now describe.\nA participant asked a question concerning the current turbulence in Italian politics with\nparticular reference to the magistrates' attitude towards the State and the Mafia. A member\nfrom Sicily, doing research in a German company in Munich, had just joined. His vivid images\nand experience of the bitter fight magistrates are conducting against the Mafia, and his position\nas newcomer, caused him to reply with vehemence (see Guiora et al, 1972). The\nmisunderstanding was not at language level but at cultural level. It transpired that none of the\nother Italians reacted aggressively because they had already adjusted their ability to 'read\nbetween the lines', to negotiate meaning regardless of accuracy, and they were already familiar\nwith the dynamics and socio-linguistic errors of the ISC.\nInteractions went from general to specific, from personal to topical and involved a range of\nskills to tackle the texts and extract information. Some reacted immediately, some preferred to\nthink about the topic and document themselves, some put more weight on their language\nimprovement, some by-passed the language issue to concentrate on the meaning.\nDistinguishing factors\nPrevious work in the area of technology and language learning (Garret, 1991; NCET, 1991;\nMathiesen, 1993) has examined the potential use of email interaction to encourage students to\nuse computers in a realistic context and enhance their communicative and thinking skills, and\nthe last decade has seen an enormous increase in the use of this communication system for\nlanguage learning. My project follows the work done by Austin and Mendlick (1993),\nKroonenberg (1994) and Eck et al (1994), in exploring the potential of email for language\nlearning.\nHalf-way through the first year, a number of factors changed and contributed to distinguishing\nthis project from others such as those above. These changes include the group composition, the\naims and objectives, the disappearance of the teacher and the development of a community\nspirit.\nGroup composition\nWhile the majority of the projects involving email tend to focus on entire classes, 'Due\nchiacchiere in amicizia' consisted of a very heterogeneous, global group far from any\ncomparison with a class. What evolved was an ISC which consisted of natives, non-natives and\nsemi-bilinguals from all over the world, and the classroom or campus network shaped into a\ncompletely different environment, unexpected to the author of this paper as well. This created\na very special and authentic setting within which language and social interaction took place -\nand still takes place. The variables between classroom and email environment are many: the\nsetting of the interaction (physical distance, lack of visual input), the type of communication\nacts (written communication), the language use opportunities (continuous and asynchronous)\nand the affective domain (the level of empathy, inhibition, self-esteem, extroversion and\n42\nAIT-) Volume 4 Number I\naggression and motivation). This is another good reason to detach the email environment from\nclassroom comparison and create a new natural environment of authentic interactions. I do not\nintend to make the assumption that one system may - or will - substitute for the other, but that\nlanguage learning is a complex phenomenon which involves social, emotional and intellectual\ndimensions, and any environment which can help the learning to happen should be tried and\nwelcomed. With Kohn (1994), I share the belief that one of the ways - perhaps the most\nsignificant and effective - in which language learners acquire a considerable and vital part of\ntheir communicative linguistic competence, is through social interaction. It is through the\nlearner's contact with the 'discourse community' (be it the workplace, the holiday resort, the\nuniversity campus or whatever) that learners can measure their competence and modify both\nlanguage needs and their cultural differences according to the challenges of their environment.\nThe degree of proficiency achieved in the language will then be affected by the extent to which\nthe learner wants to 'acculturate' to the other language group (Schumann, 1976); it will\ndepend, therefore, on factors other than simply appropriating words or grammatical rules.\nAlthough email interaction is text-based, it was very interesting to try to read aloud some of the\ninteractions produced by the semi-bilingual participants. It was my impression that you could\neasily identify from the spelling of certain words the region of origin of the parents. In\nparticular, the use of double consonants ('sonno un italiano-americano' for 'sono un italiano-\namericano'; 'mottore' for 'motore') or the substitution of a consonant or vowel ('strata' for\n'strada'; 'genetori' for 'genitori'). There were also particular structures ('lui aiuta a sua figlia',\n'voglio a praticare a lingua', etc.). This is not the place for a detailed linguistic analysis of the\nlanguage, but a positive effect email interaction had on the semi-bilingual was the development\nof language awareness (sometimes hindered by very fluent spoken language) and improvement\nof written communication. This initial impression needs to be verified by further research.\nInput, interaction and motivation clearly play a major role in language learning in and outside\nthe classroom, and played a key role in the development of the community spirit. The increase\nin frequency and length of messages, and the cosmopolitan environment, stimulated a further\nincrease in frequency, length, accuracy and motivation. As noticed by a participant, a beginner\nin Italian, 'I am talking to real Italians in Italy! Wow!'. In this situation, errors had a positive\nrole to play, and there was no such thing as making a fool of yourself, which in a face-to-face\nsituation may be a cause of anxiety. Participants started correcting each other (native to non-\nnatives), and members of the community expressly asked to send corrected messages back to\nthe main conference for everyone to benefit from.\nThe aims and objectives\nThe change of the group composition partially affected the original aims of the project in that\nmuch more emphasis was put on meaning than on language with the intervention of affective\nvariables; this was less evident in the first stage. Although the four major components of the\ncommunicative approach (Savignon 1983) were still strongly present, the concern moved\ntowards the content of the communication. Participants were still working on their grammar\n(linguistic competence) or their ability to use appropriate writing style to the context (socio-\nlinguistic competence). They were above all concerned with their ability to interpret sentences\ninto a meaningful world and achieve coherent texts which are relevant to the given context -\nespecially after a few misunderstandings (discourse competence) - and their ability to devise\nstrategies to compensate for imperfect knowledge, for example seeking clarification, repetition,\n43\nMarina Mozzon-McPherson Italian via email: from an online project towards a multi-cultural discourse community\nparaphrasing and silence (strategic competence). As previously indicated, email provided an\nideal environment to support the development of the these competences.\nThe attempt to create a real, new type of language learners' community, with its own internal\ndynamics, and to avoid a replica of a classroom environment, was a successful point of the\nproject. If we agree with some of Ausubel's theory (Ausubel, 1964) that it is not trie frequency\nof stimuli or the number of times spent practising that influence learning but the\nmeaningfulness, then the development of a natural communicative setting was a powerful\nfactor. The intensity of the interactions certainly has an important effect on memory retention\n(Brown, 1980), and has good effects on vocabulary expansion.\nOne member commented on how she improved her speaking skills (in terms of vocabulary\nrichness) and overcame her lack of confidence when in discussion.\nThe disappearance of the traditional teacher\nAlthough the teacher can create a rich environment within which authentic communication can\ntake place, research into the learning process has shown that language learning is a highly\ncomplex and individual matter (Oxford, 1990; Wenden, 1991). Taking personal responsibility\nfor the learning, and becoming aware of the mechanisms involved, are strictly related to the\nachievement of high proficiency. Language teaching in the context of this project consisted of\nsetting up the right conditions for interactions to take place and promoting induction work and\npersonal development of strategies to tackle language-focused issues. In this respect, an\nobscure and difficult grammatical point like the subjunctive was more easily clarified by its\nrecurrence in nearly every message than through a presentation of the rule. One aspect of this\napproach is the effective application of 'learning by communicating' which stimulated\nsubsequent 'induction work'.\nThis is exactly what happened in the course of the project, where students started to ask\nquestions about new structures. One, in fact, was the subjunctive - nearly always present in\neach text, and new or obscure to many non-native speakers. Through examples extracted from\nreal conversations and help from the natives, some managed to extrapolate the rule and act as\n'miniconcordancers', creating for themselves a portfolio of useful authentic examples of uses\n(Widdowson 1990; Schultz, 1991). There was a noticeable shift from the use of paraphrasing\ntechniques, to avoid the use of such a mood, to the correct use of it.\nThe gradual withdrawal of the teacher as the main language input maker, and only feedback\nprovider, also opened up opportunities for dominant personalities to mould the nature of the\ndiscussions.\nIf the communicative aspect of language learning is a vital component of current teaching\nmethodology which tries - through group-work activities, simulations and authentic materials\n(satellite TV programmes, newspapers, etc.) - to replicate the native speakers' world, this\nattempt to replicate 'authenticity' is not without weaknesses. The biggest one is the reduction\nof language learning to sets of functions and scripts ready for performance, something which\ntends to limit the ability to react to unscripted language and cultural meanings. After all, life\ndoes not always fit the script. It is in the attempt to overcome this weakness that the project\npositively created a fluid environment of unfiltered, unscripted language and culture.\n44\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nThe development of a community spirit\nSuch development shares - on a much smaller scale - many of the stages one can see in the\nCommunity Language Learning model of Rogers (1951), in that the affective and social\ndynamics were valued, the teacher was seen more like a counsellor and mediator\/translator, the\nstyle and tone of the conversation was in the hands of the group, the language was inductively\nanalysed, and 'defensive' mechanisms were made unnecessary by the supportive environment.\nFurthermore, the counsellor became a 'client' of the community.\nAs Brown (1980) has highlighted, the Community Language Learning model is not without\nproblems, and I was aware that it needed adapting. For this reason, the first stage of the project\nwas very much directed, and only at a later stage was community language learning\nintroduced. However, in order for the group dynamic processes to set and develop effectively,\ngroup work should preferably provide opportunities for learners to explore the socio-cultural\ndimension of language, and prepare and engage then in intercultural communication' (Eck et\nal, 1994,45).\nEck's remarks lead to another major aspect of this project: culture learning. The emphasis on\nactive use of the language as a technique for learning urged by the communicative language\nteaching approach has consequently demanded more authentic sources of language, hence the\nexposure to the language produced by the natives in their natural environment. As Seelye\nrightly stated:\nIf he [the learner] avoids contact with native speakers and if he lacks respect for their world\nview, of what value is his training? Where can it be put to use? What educational breadth\nhas it inspired? (Seelye, 1974,21)\nSeelye's questions effectively exemplify my project's philosophy, and highlight the\nimpossibility of distinguishing language from culture. The ISC offered a panorama of cultures\nwithin the culture, of points of view and attitudes (the Sicilian participant represented a\ndifferent culture from the girl from Bergamo or the professional from Verona). In this project,\nan interesting dimension was added by the Italian Erasmus students who used the environment\nto escape their inability to express themselves in English, and attempted to compensate for this\ntemporary loss of identity by sharing their cultural values and beliefs with the ISC. As an\nItalian participant said, 'I have more to say than I'd like a pound of tomatoes', indicating her\nfrustration at not being able to express her real social, emotional and intellectual self. As\nCortazzi and Jin (1993, 24) have noted 'the lack of shared schemas in interaction are more\nlikely to lead to communication breakdown than differences and difficulties at the level of\nlinguistic code'\nThe ISC provided the framework within which widely dispersed and disparate participants\ncould utilize their varied strengths in terms of culture and language, and benefit from the\nensuing synergy. While Teichmann (1994) argues that 'confrontation with the reality of a\ndifferent culture can lead at first to a reinforcement of all the prejudices previously cultivated',\nthis paper posits that, in the long term, email and similar media may help overcome\nstereotypical attitudes, and possibly help a fruitful appreciation of cultural values through a\nprocess of 'acculturation'. This is a long-term goal of the project, which will include more\nsophisticated cultural activities. Byram (1989) provides practical ideas to look at stereotypes,\nprejudices and culture teaching activities. In my experience on the project, when people got\ntogether and really talked about what was significant for them, the whole team became more\n45\nMarina Mozzon-McPherson Italian via email: from an online project towards a multi-cultural discourse community\nthan the sum of the individuals, and it gave birth to a lively multi-cultural community. Such an\nenvironment could be positively exploited for preparation for life abroad, either for work or\nstudy reasons, and help students to prepare from the culture shock that comes from thinking\nthat 'everyone in the world should be like me' (Adler, 1972).\nProject evaluation\nShould the success of the project be measured through the 100% renewal of the subscription\nfor 1995\/96?\nWhat is perhaps more subject to a critical evaluation is the appearance of a learning\ncommunity which embraced at least three types of interaction:\n\u2022 between native speakers;\n\u2022 between natives and non-natives;\n\u2022 with semi-bilingual members.\nFurther evidence of the development of an internal culture can be seen in the change of style of\nthe messages. Messages came to be written and addressed not to me but to 'cari amici della\nlista' ('dear friends of the list'), or to a particular person, the topics were suggested by the\nparticipants, and the length of the messages doubled. After a few incidents, a new level of\ncaution arose, not linked to grammatical concern but to a respect for the other's culture and\nhence a more careful search of the correct word to exemplify the concept one wanted to\nexpress. Language and cultural awareness for some members started to be seen as a unity. The\nposition of some semi-bilinguals in the group was interesting. They felt exposed to two\ncultures, neither of which they necessarily understood deeply. For this particular group, some\nexchanges were clearly enlightening. Despite the asynchronous level of the interactions, the\ndistance and the lack of visual signs, I found it amazing how clearly 'silences' due to non-\nunderstanding could be perceived, and it was in these situations that my role again became of\nrelevance.\nThis online Italian environment was now allowing everybody to be a teacher in proportion to\ntheir knowledge and created a micro-society where strong personalities - not necessarily the\nsame strong ones you will have in face-to-face communication - appeared and moderated\ndiscussions. In several instances, other Italians corrected language mistakes, and justified their\ncorrections. In some other situations, students took the initiative and re-orientated the\nconversation. Particular expertise came to light, and in order to let the community express\nitself, I had to learn to step back and not to interfere. I was there to foster this expertise and - if\nnecessary - to moderate the exchanges, to suggest readings and other sources of useful\ninformation, to correct grammatical mistakes (which I regularly did and sent back to the ISC\nwith the member's permission), to gauge the level of the discussion, and to make sure that\neven simple basic questions could still be asked. The exploitation of other Web facilities, for\nexample the televideo-news online or newsgroups, or surfing through Italy, helped to create a\npurposeful and authentic environment.\nSome members started asking for information connected with their research areas, etc. I myself\ndiscovered places on the Web I did not know, thanks to a computer expert actively contrib-\nuting to the list who regularly updated the list with new Web sources of information for Italian.\n46\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nIt was particularly fascinating to observe the gradual linguistic changes (in terms of accuracy\nand fluency) which some members developed in the course of the year. Because of the nature\nof the medium - which supports written interaction - learners started with very short and\nsimple messages (on average about four to five lines), and gradually moved to more complex\nones. Moreover, the speed with which one could receive feedback contributed to creating in\nthe participants this ambiguity of 'written conversation', the illusion of being in a face-to-face\nsituation, and hence sending a message to a 'real' audience online at the time of the dispatch.\nIt was not always like that, however, and sometimes there was a sense of frustration at the\n'message in the bottle' which nobody collects. Problems also arose over turn-taking or\nmisunderstanding of the rules. Another aspect of this type of communication was the\napparently incoherent and undisciplined arrival of the messages, which - because of the lack of\na subdivision per topic - was very difficult to control. It was real communication without\nfilters. And, as Grenfell (1994) has pointed out, 'real language is just not that tidy.' In most\ncases, the native speakers were using typical Italian structures, vocabulary and metaphors\nwhich denied the non-natives any chance of slow, artificial modification of the style in order to\nmake themselves understood. But this encouraged and challenged the participants to go further\nand ask relevant questions. All of a sudden, they found themselves part of an Italian\nenvironment, unlike the simulations they may have experienced in a class. Certain structures\nwere absorbed by observing how the Italians were using them: vocabulary used by the Italians\nreappeared in the non-natives' replies, applying what Ellis (1991) has brilliantly called the\n'scaffolding' process. Email helped to contextualize hitherto unknown written words, and\nhence enabled learners to remember them vividly and use them actively. What was difficult,\nand what other more sophisticated computer-conferencing systems (such as FirstClass) can\novercome, was the inability to sort out messages automatically and allow the flow of the\nthread. This meant the participants had to scan through all the messages sent to the list to see\nwhich one they wanted to reply to. This was particularly time-consuming for the two blind\nstudents. In the second phase, the list has now been subdivided in various conferences, each\nwith a thread one can follow. The conferences currently active are on politics, tourism, cultural\nissues and language.\nThe attraction of email was its potential to engage the imagination of the participants and\ncreate positive interactions where they not only moved into new areas of knowledge but lived\nthis experience as a development of their selves. Without this empowerment, language learning\nrisks being reduced to mechanical and technical competence acquisition, and hence\nsubordinate to the technology. As per Brown (1980), 'the human being is a social animal and\nthe chief mechanism for maintaining the bonds of society is language'. Some teaching methods\ntend to over-simplify or disregard the social factor as relevant for language learning by not\nrecognizing the complexity of the relation between language and society, and language and\nculture.\nTo date there is no telecommunications system which effectively can reproduce such a\ncomplexity. This shows another possible limitation of email in comparison with other\ntelecommunications applications: it does not give space for body language, and has to find\nsurrogates in the use of 'emotions', not always very effective or expressive. Nevertheless, any\nincorrect interpretation of a text caused by the inability to recognize certain socio-linguistic,\ndiscursive, grammatical or strategic aspects of the language, provided the opportunity to\nbecome aware of these aspects. Unexpected or inappropriate responses generated awareness of\n47\nMarina Mozzon-McPherson Italian via email: from an online project towards a multi-cultural discourse community\nlanguage phenomena. Once again, this could be seen as a positive aspect of language learning\nwhich the email environment was able to develop.\nConclusion\nThis attempt, which needs further refining, seems to have proved successful in that learners of\nItalian gathered together regularly and compared notes on both cultural and linguistic issues.\nDemand was such that membership had to be closed to foster the development of the existing\ncommunity spirit. However, from September 1995, new universities in both Italy and\nelsewhere have joined in, with between 5 and 20 participants from each institution. Team\nteaching, which was a missing element of the first phase, has been introduced by inviting\nlecturers of Italian from the other participating universities to moderate particular conferences,\nand some of the 'old' participants have assisted me in the development of the new framework.\nA conference has been specifically devoted to language issues, and there are 'surgeries' for\nlearner training for members to 'attend' when in need of clarification on specific points.\nDuring this year and a half of interaction, I managed to store and record a huge amount of texts\nwhich transform what could have been a conversation lost in space into something durable and\nrelevant. The texts constitute an invaluable collection of authentic interaction which could be\nre-used to stimulate future discussions. These texts need to be re-analysed in the light of\nexperience gained thus far, and this year's new developments.\nWhile language skills can be measured and quantified, cultural interactions seem to be more\ndifficult to quantify. However, further work utilizing Henri's analytical model highlighting five\nmain dimensions (participative, social, interactive, cognitive and meta-cognitive - Henri,\n1992) may prove more useful in ascertaining if this 'invaluable collection' lends itself to\nfurther analysis.\nOpen issues remain the impact on cultural awareness, vocabulary acquisition and reading\nspeed, learning styles, and teacher training to cope with the new counselling and mediating\nrole. Some of these things are currently under scrutiny in the second phase of the project.\nNote\n1.
