Metazoan mtDNA typically consists of a\ncovalently closed circular molecule, tightly packed with a\ncanonical set of 37 genes that encode for 13 inner mem-\nbrane proteins, 2 ribosomal RNAs and 22 transfer RNAs.\nThese genes have no introns and, generally, few intergenic\nspacers, the only exception being a large non-coding\nregion (A+T-rich region in hexapods) where essential reg-\nulatory sequences involved in the initiation of replication\nand transcription have been identified [1,2]. The arrange-\nment of genes along the mtDNA (gene order) is generally\nconserved within major taxonomic groups, but can differ\nextensively in specific lineages [3,4].\nIn the last few years, the genomic resources of public data-\nbases have accumulated a remarkable number of com-\nplete mitochondrial sequences for hexapods; these form\nthe largest data set of mitogenomic data available for\narthropods (59%: 81 of 151 sequences available in Gen-\nBank). Within Metazoa, the set of complete mtDNAs\nknown from hexapod species is outnumbered only by a\nfew vertebrate groups. Although numerically biased\ntowards the pterygote orders, hexapod mtDNA data have\nbeen enriched recently with entries from the more basal\nlineages (apterygote), a possible consequence of the grow-\ning interest in phylogenetic studies of insects and relatives\nfor the analysis of genome-level data sets [5-9]. At present,\n10 complete (or almost complete) mtDNA sequences\nhave been determined for collembolan (springtail) spe-\ncies, although detailed descriptions and analysis have\nbeen provided only for a minority. The \"basic\" arrange-\nment of the 37 mitochondrial genes found in collembo-\nlan species generally resembles that usually considered\nancestral for Pancrustacea [8,10]. However, rearrange-\nments of tRNA genes and\/or molecular traces of duplica-\ntion events appear to be more common than expected.\nFocusing on Antarctic organisms, a remarkable feature,\nthe loss of nad6, has been reported for notothenioid\nfishes; this unusual rearrangement has been tentatively\nassociated with heat production due to proton leakage, as\na possible physiological adaptation to cold environments\n[11].\nCollembola have been described as model organisms in\nAntarctic terrestrial ecosystem studies, on account of the\nextent of existing biochemical and ecophysiological\nresearch, and their dominant role in Antarctic terrestrial\necosystems [12]. In this study we describe the complete\nmitochondrial genome of the Antarctic collembolan\nCryptopygus antarcticus, the first example from the family\nIsotomidae and only the second (after Gomphiocephalus\nhodgsoni; [5]) for an Antarctic species. Recently, molecular\nphylogeographic studies based on mitochondrial haplo-\ntypes have contributed to the understanding of the evolu-\ntionary origins of species of the genus Cryptopygus [13].\nMitogenomics data for C. antarcticus will further contrib-\nute to studies of the patterns of distribution and the proc-\nesses of colonization of the Antarctic collembolan fauna,\na subject of particular recent interest in the context of Ant-\narctic phylogeography, carrying signals over multimillion\nyear timescales [14,15].\nResults and Discussion\nGene content and genome organization\nThe mitochondrial genome of C. antarcticus is a closed cir-\ncular molecule of 15,297 bp and contains the set of 37\ngenes usually found in metazoans [16] (Figure 1; Gen-\nBank accession number: EU016194). The gene order is\nidentical to Drosophila yakuba [17], and reflects the pre-\nsumed ancestral condition for Pancrustacea. The majority\nof genes are located on the plus or J-strand, the remainder\nhaving opposite polarity and being oriented on the minus\nor N-strand (Figure 1 & Table 1). There are four major\nnon-coding regions of 622, 123, 60 and 33 bp in length\nthat are located at the gene junctions rrnS\/trnI, trnS(uga)\/\ncob, nad6\/cob and trnE\/trnF, respectively. The largest non-\ncoding region most likely corresponds to the region (A+T-\nrich region in insects) where in other hexapods the\nsequences responsible for the initiation of transcription\nand replication of the entire genome are found [1].\nGene initiation and termination\nCanonical initiation codons (ATA or ATG), encoding the\namino acid methionine, are used in 9 PCGs (atp8, cob,\ncox1, cox3, nad2\u20135 and nad4L), whereas four other genes\nstart with non-standard codons (atp6, cox2, nad1 and\nnad6) (Table 1) as it often happens in animal mtDNAs\n[18]. Only five PCGs terminate with the complete termi-\nnation codon TAA (atp8, atp6, cox3, nad4L and nad6). In\nall other cases, stop codons are truncated (T or TA) and\ntheir functionality probably recovered after a post-tran-\nscriptional polyadenilation [19]. These abbreviated stop\ncodons are found in PCGs that are followed by a down-\nstream tRNA gene, suggesting that the secondary structure\ninformation of the tRNA genes could be responsible for\nthe correct cleavage of the polycistronic transcript. It is\nnoteworthy that in all cases an additional complete stop\ncodon is present a few bases downstream of the incom-\nplete stop codon, as if a short overlap would be necessary\nto stop the RNA polymerase in case translation should\nbegin before mRNA cleavage [3,20]. tRNA genes are usu-\nally interspersed among protein coding genes, their sec-\nondary structure acting as a signal for the cleavage of the\npolycistronic primary transcript [19,22]. However, there\nare also direct junctions between two PCGs (atp8\/atp6,\natp6\/cox3, nad6\/cob and nad4L\/nad4) where other cleavage\nsignals, different from tRNA gene secondary structures,Page 2 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2008, 9:315 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/315may be involved in the processing of the polycistronic pri-\nmary transcript [23]. In this respect, hairpin structures, fre-\nquently observed at the 3'-end of a PCG abutting the 5'-\nend of a neighbouring one, may serve as signal to direct\nimmature mRNA cleavage [24-26]. Experimental analyses\nof cDNA pools have demonstrated that some mtDNA\ngenes (i.e.: atp8\/atp6 and nad4L\/nad4) are recovered as\nbicistronic units in human HeLa cells [21] and in the dip-\nteran Anopheles funestus [25]. In the C. antarcticus mtDNA,\nwith the single exception of cox3, a complete stop codon\n(TAA) is only present when two PCGs abutt directly\n(Table 1). The gene pair nad4L\/nad4 is composed of a sin-\ngle in-frame coding unit (the two genes are separated by 6\nnucleotides), whereas atp8 and atp6 overlap (7 nucle-\notides) as is almost universally found in metazoans [25].\nTransfer RNAs\nAll the 22 tRNA genes typically found in metazoan mtD-\nNAs were identified according to their secondary structure\nand primary sequence of the corresponding anticodon\n(Figure 2). The only peculiar feature is represented by an\nadditional (and apparently non-functional) copy of the\ntRNA gene for the amino acid leucine (trnL(uag)P), that is\nlocated within a non-coding spacer (123 bp) between\ntrnS(uga) and nad1 (Figure 1). This tRNA pseudogene may\nrepresent the degenerating vestige of a duplication event\nthat occurred in collembolan mtDNA early in the evolu-\ntion of the group, given that in the same position a similar\nspacer is also present in G. hodgsoni [5] (50 bp) and Podura\naquatica [8] (150 bp).

In similar cases (in meta-\nzoans but more commonly in plants and Protozoa) base\npairing is restored post- or co-transcriptionally with an\nRNA-editing mechanism [27,28]. Overlaps between tRNA\ngenes were not frequent (4 instances) and then limited to\n1 or 2 bases (Table 1).\nRibosomal RNAs\nThe putative secondary structures of the complete small\nand large ribosomal subunits (rrnS and rrnL) have been\nreconstructed for a limited number of insect species, and\ndetailed studies are essentially available only for Dro-\nsophila virilis, D. melanogaster [29] and Apis mellifera [30].\nWithin basal hexapod groups, the architectures of the\nribosomal subunits have been tentatively reconstructed\nonly for the two species Campodea fragilis and C. lubbocki\n[31], and a more detailed analysis has been performed\nonly for domain III of the small RNA subunit of several\nArthropleona species [32]. Additional comparative analy-\nses in basal hexapod lineages are required to allow an\naccurate comparison with current secondary structure\nmodels of holometabolan insects [30], and we therefore\nmade no attempt to reconstruct the structure of the rrnS\nand rrnL rRNA here.\nA+T-rich region\nPrevious analyses of the Drosophila A+T-rich region identi-\nfied the signals responsible for the origin of replication of\nthe major and minor strands (OJ and ON, respectively)\nand confirmed that, at least in this genus, the mtDNA rep-\nlicates with a strand-asynchronous, asymmetric mecha-\nnism [1]. Mapping of OJ and ON in Drosophila and other\ninsect A+T-rich regions has recently allowed the definition\nof primary sequences and secondary structure elements\ninvolved in the initiation of the replication process [1,33-\n36]. In holometabolan insects, two distinct thymine\nstretches, one located near trnI on the N-strand and\nanother in the center of the A+T-rich region on the J-\nstrand, appear to be responsible for OJ and ON replication,\nrespectively. Similarly, a thymine stretch plays an essential\nrole in the initiation of the replication system of the Light\nstrand (OL) in mammals (although in this case the two OR\nare separated by 2\/3 of the genome), and is also believed\nto be involved in protein binding and primer RNA synthe-\nsis. Nevertheless, the conservation of thymine stretches\namong insects appears to be a peculiarity of more derived\norders, with alternative sequences probably responsible\nfor OR in basal hexapod lineages [1].\nThe A+T-rich region of C. antarcticus is 622 bp; it shows six\n\"TA\" tandem repeats of variable length (from 5 to 7 units)\nand a low similarity in primary sequence with other colle-\nmbolan specimens. The identification of sequences\nhomologous to those observed in holometabolan insects\ninvolved in OR was not completely successful in defining\npotential regulatory elements. In this respect, four thym-\nine stretches of variable size (4 to 6) could be observed on\nthe N-strand, within 100 bp of trnI, but none of them\nappears to correspond, in terms of size and position, to\nthat observed in Drosophila. In addition, in agreement\nwith previous reports [1] there is no thymine stretch\nlonger than 6 bp on this strand. Conversely, in the C. ant-\narcticus J-strand, a longer thymine stretch (14 bp) is\npresent between nucleotides 14996 and 15009 and this\nappears to be assimilable (both in primary sequence and\nposition) to the one observed in the central portion of the\nDrosophila A+T-rich region. Similarly to Drosophila, this\nportion of the C. antarcticus A+T-rich region may also act\nas the ON, given that the motif \"ACTATTT\", frequently\npresent in Drosophila (in 8\/12 different species; see: Figure\n6, in [1]), is found 11 bp downstream of the 14-bp thym-\nine stretch. If this evidence is confirmed by additional\ndata on basal hexapod mtDNA sequences, the role of con-\nserved primary sequence stretches in the initiation of the\nreplication mechanism might be confirmed as a common\nfeature of all hexapod groups (at least for the N-strand),\nThe mitochondrial genome organization of Cryptopygus ant-arcticusFigure 1\nThe mitochondrial genome organization of Cryptopy-\ngus antarcticus.

The\npresence of hypothetical secondary structures involved in\nthe initiation of the origin of replication process of the C.\nantarcticus mtDNA is difficult to establish. In this species\nthe entire A+T-rich region can be folded in several paired\nstructures, and additional comparative studies will be\nneeded to clarify their role.\nNon-coding regions\nUnlike those of plants, animal mitochondrial genomes\nare very compact, with a high proportion of coding vs\nnon-coding sequences [16,37]. Intergenic spacers are usu-\nally limited in number and size, and their occurrence is\nbelieved to be the result of errors of the mtDNA replica-\ntion system (i.e. duplication of parts of the mitochondrial\ngenomes, with redundant copies becoming pseudogenes\nand disappearing). Apart from the A+T-rich region, the\nlargest (123 bp) non-coding sequence of the C. antarcticus\nmtDNA is located between trnS(uga) and nad1. Within\nthis region, an additional copy of trnL(uag) (Figures. 1\nand 2) can be identified. Given that a functional copy of\nthis gene is present in its canonical position between nad1\nand rrnL genes (as in other arthropod mtDNAs), and that\nthere are several mismatches in the acceptor arm that\nmight compromise the correct folding into a typical clo-\nverleaf structure, we believe that trnL(uag)P may represent\nthe molecular trace of an older duplication event that\noccurred during the evolution of this species (there are\nalso alternative interpretations, see below). It is notewor-\nthy that this genomic region is also subject to molecular\nrearrangments in other collembolan species (i.e. one\ntRNA translocation in Tetrodontophora bielanensis and Ony-\nchiurus orientalis) or shows intergenic spacers similar to\nthose observed in C. antarcticus (i.e. 48 bp in G. hodgsoni).\nThis observation suggests that the DNA fragment encom-\npassing cob and nad1 may represent a \"hot spot\" for rear-\nrangements in the collembolan mitochondrial genome,\nand that either several taxa have independently under-\ngone rearrangements or these have occurred before the\ndifferentiation of the major collembolan lineages.\nIt is well known that tRNA genes are more prone to trans-\nlocations than protein coding genes, with \"hot spots\" of\nrearrangement being described in some lineages [38,39].\nIn the case of the collembolan mtDNA, we speculate that\na replication error (probably due to slipped strand mis-\npairing) may have generated an intermediate state with at\nleast a duplicated copy of the trnL(uag) gene. Afterwards,\nthe superfluous copy(ies) may have been transformed\ninto a pseudogene, whereas the original copy could have\nconserved its functionality (therefore leading to no\nchanges in the gene order). Presently, it is only possible to\nconclude that: 1) similar (for size and position) intergenic\nspacers have been also found in two species of the genus\nCampodea (Diplura [31]), another basal hexapod group\nprobably as primitive as Collembola; 2) the gene junction\ntrnS(uga)\/nad1 corresponds to the shift of the coding\npolarity between two blocks of genes (nad6-cob-trnS(uga)\noriented on the J-strand, and nad1-trnL(uag)-rrnL-trnV-\nrrnS on the N-strand). Interestingly, experiments con-\nducted on transcriptional termination factors in D. mela-\nnogaster have identified the positions of some binding\nsites that are responsible for the control of multiple tran-\nscription units on the mtDNA of this species [40]. One of\nthe most interesting results of these studies is that, unlike\nhuman, and along with sea urchin mtDNA [41-44], in\nDrosophila one of these terminator sites is not located at\nthe 3'-end of the ribosomal genes. Conversely, two\nstretches of non-coding sequence would correspond to\nthe binding sites for the Drosophila mitochondrial tran-\nscription termination factor (DmTTF), a nuclear-encoded\nprotein involved in the processes of attenuation and\/or\ntermination of mRNA transcripts [40]. Intriguingly, the\nshort stretches of non-coding sequences identified in Dro-\nsophila as DmTTF binding sites are located at the gene\njunctions trnE\/trnF and trnS(uga)\/nad1, in the same posi-\ntions where C. antarcticus shows intergenic spacers (Table\n1). Not only their position is identical, but also these\nsequences are located in a position of abrupt shift in the\ntranscription polarity of the mtDNA genes (a suitable\nposition for an attenuator\/terminator of mRNA synthe-\nsis). Nevertheless, the non-coding regions of Drosophila\nand C. antarcticus, show no discernible sign of homology,\nleaving open the question of whether they do play the\nsame role. It should be noted, however, the signalling role\nmay be played by secondary structure motifs, like those\nobserved between trnS(uga) and nad1 in Collembola and\nDiplura mtDNAs, rather than primary sequence.\nRepeats and palindromic sequences\nTwo perfect palindromic sequences were observed. One is\n38 bp long and spans the junction between the nad2 and\ntrnW (positions 1196\u20131233). The second is 18 bp long\nand lies 42 bp from the 3'end of rrnS (14033\u201314050).\nThree repeated sequences were found in different areas of\nthe genome. One is 22 bp long and encompasses the ini-\ntial part of both trnL(uaa) and trnL(uag) (note that these\nlatter genes are oriented on opposite strands), from base 3\nto base 24 (with one mismatch). Interestingly, although\nduplication and remolding events of leucine tRNA genes\nhave probably occurred independently several times\nwithin some major animal lineages [45], the observed 22\nbp-long fragment is highly conserved in all collembolan\nspecies investigated (data not shown) suggesting that pri-\nmary sequence and precise conformation of this region is\nimportant for the building of both tRNA genes and\/or for\ntheir interaction with the ribosomal complex.Page 6 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2008, 9:315 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/315A second perfect direct repeated sequence, 18 bp long, is\nobserved at 105 bp from the 3'-end of rrnS (14096\u2013\n14113), and at 7 bp from the 3'-end of nad6 (10309\u2013\n10327). A partially overlapping sequence of 17 bp is also\nrepeated in inverted orientation in the middle of the A+T-\nrich region.\nBase composition and codon usage\nThe mtDNA of many arthropod lineages is characterized\nby a strong compositional bias showing high values of A%\nand T% vs. G% and C%. This trend in nucleotide compo-\nsition (A+T bias) is remarkable in some insect groups (i.e.\nholometabolan orders) and, to a lesser extent, is also\napparent in the more basal hexapod lineages [31]. The C.\nantarcticus mtDNA is 70.9% A+T-rich, and therefore in the\nrange observed for other collembolan species (A+T con-\ntents spanning from 65.5% to 74.1%) [5,8]. The observed\nA+T content strongly influences the use of two- and four-\nfold degenerate synonymous sites in protein coding\ngenes, with relaxed pressure probably responsible for the\nmost frequent use of NNA and NNU codons (Table 2).\nAnother remarkable molecular feature of metazoan mtD-\nNAs is the asymmetry in the composition of the nucle-\notide content between the two strands [46]. Usually, A%\nand C% are higher than T% and G% on the J-strand\n(appropriately named plus strand because of its positive\nAT and CG skew), whereas the reverse is observed in the\nN-strand (hence named minus strand). Asymmetry in\nnucleotide composition among strands may be due to the\npeculiar replication and transcription mechanisms [47].\nIn mammals, it has been demonstrated that the duplica-\ntion of the mitochondrial genome (usually defined as the\n'strand-displacement' or 'leading and lagging' model) is\nasynchronous and requires extensive displacement of the\nH strand, that therefore transiently is found in a single-\nstrand state ([48]; but see also alternative views in [49]).\nThe longer the time this strand is unpaired during replica-\ntion (DSSH), the more pronounced is the compositional\nasymmetry between H and L strands [50]. In the few cases\nwhere mtDNA replication has been studied in insects\n(essentially Drosophila), the mechanism is also \"more\nasynchronous\" given that both origins of replication (ON\nand OJ) are located in the A+T-rich region (rather than at\n3\/4 of the genome, as in the strand-displacement model\nof replication) [1], and synthesis of the major coding\nstrand begins after 97% of the minor strand has been rep-\nlicated [1,2,51]. Being the N-strand, during its single-\nstranded status, more prone to deaminations than double\nstranded DNA, A\u2192G and C\u2192U transitions are more likely\nto occurr. This mutational pressure generates inequalities\nin the nucleotide composition between the two strands\nwith positive AT-skew and CG-skew values resulting on\nthe J-strand [20,47].\nRemarkable strand compositional biases have been previ-\nously observed in the mtDNA of some basal hexapod lin-\neages [31,47,52]. In the J-strand of the C. antarcticus\ncytosines are always more frequent than guanines, leading\nto a positive CG-skew (0.148). Conversely, the AT-skew is\nonly moderately positive, as calculated over the entire\ngenome (0.058) and in III codon positions of the J-strand\nPCGs (0.048), or negative, as calculated over entire PCGs\n(-0.082 and -0.27 for protein coding genes oriented on\nthe J-strand and N-strand, respectively). On the other\nhand, remarkable negative values of AT and CG skew are\nobserved on the N-strand (AT-skew = -0.27 and CG-skew\n= -0.193, for all PCGs positions; AT-skew = -0.227 and\nCG-skew = -0.189, for 3rd positions only). This latter bias\nmay be due to the high frequency of mutational events\nleading to deamination of A and G nucleotides of the dis-\nplaced N-strand, occurring during the replication of\nmtDNA. Different rates of transitions (A\u2192G < C\u2192U;\n[44]) may have eventually led to the asymmetry (negative\nAT and CG skews) of nucleotide composition and to the\nhigher T% vs A% of PCGs oriented on the N-strand.\nIn this respect, the frequency of adenines and thymines is\napproximately equal in the genes encoded on the J-strand,\nwhereas a higher percentage of A vs T (counting on the J-\nstrand) is observed in those oriented on the N-strand (Fig-\nure 3). If the strand displacement model of mtDNA repli-\ncation described in mammals and Drosophila also holds\nfor Collembola, we can speculate that the block of genes\nspanning from rrnS to trnF (all genes oriented on the N-\nstrand except for trnT, nad6, cob and trnS(uga); Figures 1\nand 3) is more prone to the deamination type C\u2192U than\nthe opposite strand (due to higher DSSH), and that transi-\ntions between C and T are more frequent than those\nbetween A and G. Perhaps this trend, observed only in the\nPCGs oriented on the N-strand, is dependent on a higher\nnumber of mutations occurring during transcription,\nrather than replication, and is consequently less etched in\nthe PCGs encoded on the J-strand. In addition, it has been\ndemonstrated that cytosine is the most unstable of the\nfour bases and the number of C deaminations is more\npronounced in single-strand DNAs [53].\nThe asymmetrical directional mutation pressure [54]\nobserved in the two strands strongly influences the codon\nusage of PCGs oriented in opposite directions [55-57]. In\nthis respect, NNA and NNC codons are more frequent\nthan NNU and NNG in the PCGs encoded on the J-strand,\nwhereas the N-strand genes show exactly the opposite\ntrend (Figure 4). Codon usage may also be influenced by\nother molecular processes such as translational selection\nefficiency and accuracy [58], which apparently have a\nstronger influence in organisms with rapid growth rates\n[59]. In addition, recent analyses of codon usage in four-\nfold degenerate codons of mammal and fish mtDNAsPage 7 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2008, 9:315 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/315have demonstrated that there are context-dependent\nmutational effects (correlations between pairs of neigh-\nboring bases). In this respect, the second codon position\nbase strongly influences the presence of a specific nucle-\notide at fourfold degenerate sites, and these latter are not\nindependent from the first-position nucleotide of the fol-\nlowing codon [60].\nNucleotide variability of collembolan mitochondrial PCGs\nThe nucleotide variability of each mitochondrial PCG has\nbeen estimated calculating gene-by-gene average values of\ngenetic distances (Appendix 1: dist.jpg), across all collem-\nbolan taxa for which full (or nearly complete) mtDNAs\nare available (Appendix 2: list.exl). Distances values are\nhigher for nad2, nad3 and cob, suggesting these genes to be\nthe least conserved ones in the mtDNA of Collembola.\nConversely, the more conserved mitochondrial genes are\nsome of the cytochrome family (complexes 1 to 3) and\nnad1. The distribution of the observed nucleotide variabil-\nity is somewhat difficult to explain. However, according to\nthe proposed model of mtDNA replication mechanism\n(studied for a restricted number of hexapods taxa [1]), the\ngenes located in the vicinity of the A+T-rich region remain\nfor a longer time in a single-strand state during the\nmtDNA replication and therefore are more exposed to\nhydrolytic and oxidative damages [50]. This interpreta-\ntion could explain the high levels of divergence observed\nfor nad2. In addition, sites for the attenuation of the\nmtDNA transcription mechanism [43] (i.e. located in the\nvicinity of nad3 and cob) may also be important to\nincrease the mutation load for neighbour genes. Collec-\ntively, these DNA fragments are probably more prone to\nhigher substitution rates than the others due to their posi-\ntion along the mtDNA, although no experimental study\nhas been performed to sustain this hypothesis. Alterna-\ntively, structural constraints at the protein level may result\nin site-specific selective pressures acting differently and in\na scattered manner along the mitochondrial genome, with\nsome genes bearing a higher mutational load than others.\nConclusion\nThe description and analysis of the complete mtDNA\ngenome sequence of C. antarcticus has led to new insights\non the mitogenomics of the group, and significantly\nadded to our knowledge on mitochondrial genomes from\nspecies adapted to the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem. Sev-\neral peculiarities, such as nucleotide and strand-specific\ncompositional bias, the occurrence of truncated stop\ncodons of PCGs and the presence of mismatches and\/or\nincomplete tRNA arms, have been observed. However, no\ndistinguishing molecular features can be associated with\nadaptation to the extreme polar environment. The gene\norder is canonical, but two unusual and large non-coding\nregions were observed in sites of abrupt shift of the coding\npolarity. Such intergenic spacers may contain the regula-\ntory signals involved in the replication and\/or transcrip-\ntion of the mtDNA, although additional data will be\nneeded to better clarify their function. Segments of these\nintergenic regions can apparently be folded in typical clo-\nverleaf structures, and probably represent duplicated ves-\ntigial versions of at least one tRNA gene.

The\ncomplete mitochondrial genome was sequenced by com-\nbining direct sequencing of three PCR fragments ampli-\nfied with universal primers, and shotgun sequencing of\nthree fragments obtained through Long-PCR amplifica-\ntion with specific primers. Initial amplification and\nsequencing of three short mtDNA fragments (cox1\/cox2,\ncob and rrnL, totalling \u2248 3 kb) was performed using prim-\ners C1-J-1751\/C1-N-2191, CB-J-10933\/CB-N-11367 and\nLR-J-12887\/LR-N-13398 [61] using several DNA extrac-\ntions from different C. antarcticus specimens. Six specific\nprimers were designed to amplify (using an additional\nDNA extraction from a single specimen) the rest of the\ngenome in three fragments of approximately 2 kb (1), 6\nkb (2) and 4 kb (3) via Long-PCR: 1) CANcox2-3453J\n(CGCTTACTGGATGTAGACAATCGCACAG)\/CANcox3-\n5245N (GAGCCGTACGCTGAGTCTGAAATTG), 2)\nCANcox3-5269J (CAATTTCAGACTCAGCGTACGGCTC)\/\nCANcob-11444N (CACAATTGTTAAAATTTGTCCCAC)\nand 3) CANtrnSuga-11574J (AGTGATTAAGCACTTAC-\nCTTGAAAGCAAGCTAC)\/CANcox1-3053N (CTAGAA-\nGAGGAGAAGCTGCGTTTTGG). Long PCR conditions\nwere the following: 1) fragment CANcox2-3453J\/\nCANcox3-5245N, 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 60 for 1 min and 68\u00b0\nfor 2 min 30 sec, 35 cycles; 2) fragment CANcox3-5269J\/\nCANcob-11444N, 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50 for 1 min and 68\u00b0\nfor 7 min, 35 cycles; 3) fragment CANtrnSuga-11574J\/\nCANcox1-3053N, 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50 for 1 min and 68\u00b0\nfor 8 min 30 sec, 35 cycles.\nAmplifications were performed on a Gene Amp\u00ae PCR Sys-\ntem 2700 (Applied Biosystem) in 25 \u03bcl reaction volume\ncomposed of: 10.75 \u03bcl of sterilized distilled water, 2.5 \u03bcl\nof LA PCR Buffer II (Takara), 2.5 \u03bcl of 25 mM MgCl2, 4 \u03bcl\nof dNTPs mix, 1.25 \u03bcl of each primer (10 \u03bcM), 2.5 \u03bcl of\nDNA template and 0.25 \u03bcl (1.25 U) of TaKaRa LA Taq\npolymerase (Takara). Long-PCR fragments were purified\nusing the Microcon\u00ae Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore),\nrandomly sheared to 1.2\u20131.5 kb DNA segments using a\nHydroShear device (GeneMachines).

Each resulting clone was\nsequenced on both strands in a CEQ 8000XL automated\nDNA Analysis System (Beckman Coulter). Eventually,\nregions of \"unsatisfactory coverage\" and small gaps in the\nsequences have been amplified and sequenced using\nstandards protocols and different Long-PCR amplifica-\ntions as template. Sequences were manually corrected and\nassembled with the software Sequencher 4.4.2 (Gene\nCodes). Long-PCR products were composed with those\ninitially generated for short fragments to provide the com-\nplete genome sequence. Hence, the final assemblies were\nbased on a minimum sequence coverage of 5\u00d7, that is the\nresults of a pool of individuals, although only for a very\nshort portion of the molecule (essentially limited to small\nfragments of cox1\/cox2 and cob, given the supposed con-\nservation of the amplified region of the rrnL). Screening of\nnucleotide sequences, obtained from specimens of the\nsame locality, provides no extreme variability (essentially\nlimited to the 3rd codon positions) for either cox1\/cox2\nand cob fragments (data not shown).\nGene annotation and analysis\nGenes encoding proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs were identi-\nfied according to their amino acid translation or second-\nary structure features, respectively. Individual gene\nsequences were compared with the homologous sequence\nof other collembolan species available in GenBank and\ninspected for the presence of gene overlaps, non-canoni-\ncal start codons and truncated termination codons, and\nunusual structures at gene junctions. The secondary struc-\nture of tRNA genes was manually reconstructed and ren-\ndered using the software Rna Viz 2.0 [62]. Nucleotide\nvariability of collembolan mtDNA (see Additional file 1:\ndist.jpg) was assessed using thirteen alignments of the\nPCGs. Basic sequence statistics and genetic distances\namong collembolan genes were calculated using PAUP*\n4b8 [63] (see Additional file 2: list.xls), whereas codon\nusage and RSCU values were calculated using codonw\n[64]. Strand asymmetry was measured using the formulas\nAT-skew = [A%-T%]\/[A%+T%] and CG-skew = [C%-G%]\/\n[C%+G%] [46,47]. The presence of repeated sequences\nwithin non-coding fragments was studied using the mreps\nsoftware [65]. The presence of additional repeats and pal-\nindromic sequences was investigated using Blast, and hits\nwith e-value < 0,05 were retained for further analysis.\nAbbreviations\natp6 and atp8: genes for ATP synthase subunits 6 and 8;\ncox1-3, genes for subunits I-III of cytochrome c oxidase;\ncob: gene for cytochrome b; nad1-6 and nad4L, genes for\nsubunits 1\u20136 and 4L of NADH dehydrogenase; rrnL and\nrrnS: genes for the small and large subunits of ribosomal\nRNA; trnX: genes encoding transfer RNA molecules with\ncorresponding amino acids denoted by the one-letter\ncode and anticodon indicated in parentheses (xxx) when\nnecessary; tRNA-X: transfer RNA molecules with corre-\nsponding amino acids denoted with a one-letter code; bp:\nbase pair; DSSH: single-stranded state of a site on the\nheavy-strand of mitochondrial DNA; mtDNA: mitochon-\ndrial DNA; PCR: Polymerase Chain Reaction; PCG: Pro-\ntein Coding Gene; RSCU: Relative Synonymous Codon\nUsage; BAS: British Antarctic Survey (UK); PNRA: Italian\nNational Program of Antarctic Research (I).\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAC sampled the specimens, sequenced the new mitochon-\ndrial genome, performed the molecular analyses and\ndrafted the manuscript.

Genetic distances were calculated from 13 independent align-\nments (performed adjusting preliminary automated alignments obtained \nusing the software RevTrans [66]). The proportion of unalignable (green) \npositions for each gene-based alignment (left side of x-axis) is depicted. \nGenetic distances (right side of x-axis) were calculated under the Maxi-\nmum Likelihood method. Model selection was performed gene-by-gene \nusing an identical tree adapted after [9]. The GTR+I+\u0393 always resulted \nas the best fitting model (plus parameters used to accommodate rate het-\nerogeneity among sites), with the only exception of atp8 (HKY+I+\u0393). \nNote that the proportion of the alignable sites for this latter gene is very \nlow (57\/189), so that in this case the high average values of genetic dis-\ntances (*) can not be considered reliable, likewise to previous analysis of \nvertebrate mitochondrial genomes that also described the atp8 as the fast-\nest-evolving mtDNA gene [50].\nClick here for file\n[http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/supplementary\/1471-\n2164-9-315-S1.jpeg]\nAdditional file 2\nList of complete (or almost complete) mtDNA collembolan species \nincluded in the analysis of gene-by-gene genetic distances with the corre-\nsponding GenBank accession number.\nClick here for file\n[http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/content\/supplementary\/1471-\n2164-9-315-S2.xls]Page 10 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2008, 9:315 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/9\/315Acknowledgements\nThis work was supported by grants from the Italian Program of Research \nin Antarctica (PNRA), the Italian MIUR (PRIN) and the University of Siena \n(P.A.R.) to AC and FF.
