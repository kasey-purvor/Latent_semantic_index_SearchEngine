Existing research on\norganisational stories indicates that they are not simply frivolous diver-\nsions that seek to amaze and entertain the recipients. Rather they may\nserve a number of important functions for organisations, which include\nsocialising new organisational members by articulating the culture of an\norganisation; assisting with the development and verbalisation of\nvisions and strategies; helping develop points of similarity within dis-\nparate and dispersed organisational groups; sustaining and legitimating\nexisting power relationships as well as providing opportunities for\nresistance against them; and acting as collective organisational memory\nsystems (Boje 1991, 1995, 2001; Boyce 1995; B. Clark 1972; Gabriel\n1991, 1995; Moeran 2007; Mumby 1987; Wilkins 1983).\nWhilst previous studies have produced important insights into var-\nious aspects of storytelling within organisations, a common failing has\nbeen their focus on the analysis of textual recordings of stories rather\nthan an examination of their in situ production. It has generally been\nassumed that a story\u2019s original meaning and purpose, as conveyed when\nit was initially told, is apparent from an analysis of a textual record of\nthis event. With notable exceptions (e.g. Boje 1991, 1995, 2001), story-\ntelling has not been viewed as a situated communicative act. This is\nsurprising given that, as David Boje (2001) demonstrates, studying\nstorytelling episodes as situated communicative acts, which are shaped\nnot only by storytellers but also by story recipients, is critical to under-\nstanding their form, function and reception.\nIn this chapter we show how conversation analysis can be used to\nstudy storytelling as a situated communicative act and to shed light on\nhow the performative impact of stories may vary significantly when\nthey are told on different occasions.

The speaker, Daniel Goleman, is a\nhighly successful presenter on the international management lecture\ncircuit and one of an elite group of management speakers referred to\nas management gurus. Management gurus are purveyors of influential\nmanagement ideas such as \u2018excellence\u2019, \u2018culture change\u2019, \u2018learning orga-\nnisation\u2019, \u2018business process re-engineering\u2019 and, in the case of Daniel\nGoleman, \u2018emotional intelligence\u2019. In addition to writing best-selling\nmanagement books they disseminate their ideas in live presentations to\naudiences of managers around the world (Huczynski 1993; Jackson\n2001; T. Clark and Salaman 1996, 1998). As perhaps the highest-\nprofile group of management speakers in the world, they use their\nlectures to build their personal reputations with audiences of managers.\nMany gain reputations as powerful orators and subsequently market\nrecordings of their talks as parts of audio- and DVD\/web-based man-\nagement training packages. A key element of their success is seen as the\nstories they tell (T. Clark and Salaman 1998; Huczynski 1993). Stories\ntherefore help build and sustain their reputations with audiences well\nbeyond the initial popularity of a book.\nThe storytelling episodes analysed in the present chapter are drawn\nfrom two commercially available video recordings of lectures given by\nGoleman. The chapter begins with a brief review of the literature on\nstorytelling in organisations. It then shows, through a comparative\nanalysis of two occasions on which Goleman tells the same story, how\nstories are shaped with respect to and by the interaction between the\nspeakers and audience members and how their meaning and performa-\ntive impact may vary significantly when they are told on different\noccasions. The analysis builds on our previous conversation analytic\nresearch on speaker\u2013audience interaction in the context of both man-\nagement and political oratory (Greatbatch and Clark 2002, 2003,\n2005; Heritage and Greatbatch 1986). The chapter concludes by draw-\ning out some of the theoretical, methodological and substantive impli-\ncations of this approach for research on stories in management and\norganisation studies.\nStorytelling as a communicative act\nA review of the literature indicates that researchers have adopted a\nvariety of approaches when collecting organisational stories. Some\nThe situated production of stories 97\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nstudies have searched for examples of organisational stories in the\nacademic literature and historical accounts of organisations (B. Clark\n1972; Martin et al. 1983; Mumby 1987). Others have tape recorded\nconversations and interactions in a number of formal and informal\ncontexts within organisations in conjunction with notes derived\nfrom participant observation (Boje 1991; Gabriel 1995; Smart 1999).\nFurther methods have included experiments (Martin and Powers 1983)\nand surveys (McConkie and Boss 1986; Wilkins 1984). Finally, a\nnumber of researchers, in addition to collecting stories from a range of\ndocumentary sources, have used unstructured interviews in order to\nidentify stories that are circulating within a variety of different types of\norganisations (Gabriel 1995, 2000; Moeran 2007; Wilkins 1983).\nHowever, regardless of the approach adopted, Boje (1991, 1995,\n2001), drawing on the earlier critique of the anthropological and folklor-\nist story literature by Robert Georges (1969, 1980), has argued that\nstudies of storytelling within organisations have adopted what he terms\nthe \u2018stories-as-texts paradigm\u2019. Whether the research has been extensive\nor intensive, based on surveys, experimental methods, questionnaires,\ninterviews or archival\/documentary research, stories have been treated as\nobjective data disconnected from their original telling. They are viewed as\nnothing more than texts with little attention given to the natural context\nin which the stories are told. Consequently, as Boje (1991: 109) notes,\n\u2018the textual content, rather than the storytelling event, is the focus of\nstudy\u2019. Drawing on arguments from the folklore literature, the point he\nmakes is that the fullmeaning of a story is assumed to be discernable from\na detailed analysis of a textual record of the words used by the teller.\nHowever, he argues, this fails to include a number of elements that\ncombine to create a storytelling performance and ignores the active\ninfluence of the recipients. This point is well captured by Georges\n(1969: 316) when he writes of the dominant folklorist approach to\ncollecting stories that \u2018these texts constitute nothing more than a written\nrepresentation of one aspect of the message of complex communicative\nevents\u2019. So, when stories are treated as texts they are disembodied from\ntheir original telling within the specific context and organisation, with the\nconsequence that their significance as performed entities is lost. Thus,\nwithout examining storytelling in its natural context we cannot be certain\nhow the specific characters, plot elements, narrative structure and empha-\nsis work separately and in conjunction with one another to underpin the\nachievement of the telling of the story.\n98 David Greatbatch and Timothy Clark\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nEven when stories are collected through ethnographic methods\ninvolving conversations, such as in formal and informal interviews,\nresearchers do not regard this as a particular storytelling event that\ndiffers from that within the organisation. Rather the performative\ncontexts of the interview and the organisation are treated as identical.\nYet, as Yiannis Gabriel (1995: 496) argues, the nature of a story is\nmodified through repeated tellings in that at each telling \u2018some ele-\nments are discarded, others are incorporated or elaborated\u2026 each text\nmay then travel, undergoing further elaborations with each recital\u2019.\nNevertheless, the underlying assumption in much prior research of\norganisational storytelling is that the informant is reproducing as pre-\ncisely as they are able a story that they may have previously recounted\nto their organisational colleagues or heard told. Again this criticism\nmirrors that made by Georges when he writes with respect to folklorist\nresearch, \u2018Most researchers tend to regard storytellers as carriers of\nspecific stories or kinds of stories and conceive the principal duty of the\nstoryteller as reproducing or re-creating, as \u201caccurately\u201d as possible,\nindividual stories he has heard from others, while those who hear these\nstories from him will in turn \u201cpass them on\u201d, again, as \u201caccurately\u201d as\npossible, to others.\u2019 From this point of view researchers of organisa-\ntional stories similarly view interviewees\/informants\/storytellers as\nhaving a special ability to \u2018reproduce or recreate [a story], insofar as\nis possible, with word-for-word consistency from telling to telling\u2019\n(Georges 1969: 323). Despite Yiannis Gabriel\u2019s (1995) point that\nstories vary in important ways from one telling to another, stories are\nassumed to have an unchanging quality regardless of the specific con-\ntext within which they are told.\nThis approach in turn assumes that the mode of communication\nadopted by the storyteller is that of sender and that of the audience is\npassive recipient. Storytellers and audiences do not therefore actively\nparticipate and so mutually influence the telling of an unfolding story.\nHowever, given the situated production of stories it cannot be\nassumed that the same story is told in an identical way to different\naudiences. This latter observation echoes with Gail Jefferson\u2019s (1978:\n219) argument that \u2018stories are sequenced objects articulating with the\nparticular context in which they are told. For example, storytelling can\ninvolve a story preface in which the teller projects a forthcoming story, a\nnext turn in which a co-participant aligns themselves as a story recipi-\nent, a next in which the teller produces a story, and a next in which the\nThe situated production of stories 99\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nstory recipient talks by reference to the story.\u2019 Given that in conversa-\ntions stories emerge from turn-by-turn talk, informants may select one\nstory from a range of possible alternatives and adjust their rendition by\nemphasising certain features over others to meet the locally occasioned\ncircumstances of the research interview (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1975).\nFurthermore, whether the researcher is aware of it or not, their own\nverbal and non-verbal reactions to the unfolding story will influence any\nparticular rendition.\nIn this chapter, we demonstrate the importance of studying story-\ntelling as a real-time communicative act by comparing two storytelling\nepisodes in which the management speaker Daniel Goleman recounts\nthe same story to different audiences during lectures given on the\nmanagement lecture circuit in the United States. Using the approach\nand findings of conversation analytic studies of storytelling in talk-in-\ninteraction (e.g. C. Goodwin 1984; Jefferson 1978; Sacks 1974, 1992),\nwe track each storytelling episode as it unfolds in real time. Our analysis\nexemplifies the problems with the \u2018stories-as-texts\u2019 paradigm in two\ninterrelated ways. First, it shows how the same story is presented and\ninterpreted in different ways in the two lectures, even though the word-\ning is very similar. Secondly, it shows how the meaning and significance\nof the story are negotiated between the storyteller and story recipients\non a moment-by-moment basis as the storytelling episodes unfold, and\nhow paralinguistic and kinesic cues, which are rarely, if ever, considered\nin storytelling research in organisation studies (Boje 1991, 2001), play a\nkey role this process.\nAnalysis\nDaniel Goleman is the author of the best-selling book titled Emotional\nIntelligence (1996). This spent over a year on theNew York Times best-\nseller list. Prior to that he was a science journalist and wrote for pub-\nlications such as the New York Times. On the basis of the success of\nEmotional Intelligence he has become a frequent and highly regarded\nspeaker on the international management lecture circuit. The story that\nis focus of our analysis is told on two different occasions. The first\ntelling, in Lecture 1 (\u2018Emotional Intelligence: A Cornerstone of\nLearning Communities\u2019), occurs in a dimly lit conference centre.\nGoleman speaks for just over fifty minutes to an audience of more\nthan a hundred people from behind a podium. Occasionally he moves\n100 David Greatbatch and Timothy Clark\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\naway from the podium but never in front of it. The second telling, in\nLecture 2, occurs a year or two later during a seventy-five minute speech\n(\u2018Emotional Intelligence\u2019) to an audience of around a hundred people.\nThe audience sits on a tiered structure arranged in a horseshoe shape.\nGoleman is able to wander the floor in full view, without any obstacles\nbetween the audience and himself. The setting is much brighter and\nmore intimate and has a colourful backdrop. Apart from the nature of\nthe auditorium and audience, a critical difference between these two\nlectures is Goleman\u2019s appearance. In the first lecture he is heavily\nbearded and wears glasses. In the second lecture he has trimmed his\nbeard and does not wear glasses. The importance of this difference will\nbecome apparent when we discuss the analysis of the two tellings.\nThe story concerns Goleman\u2019s experience(s) on catching a bus inNew\nYork. Goleman depicts the bus driver\u2019s actions as exemplifying emo-\ntional intelligence in that he succeeded in energising passengers who\nwere initially irritable and unsociable due, in part, to the hot weather.\nAs Table 5.1 shows, the two renditions of the story are very similar in\nterms of both their structure and wording.\nIn each lecture Goleman tells the story, positively assesses the central\ncharacter and then goes on to discuss the element of emotional intelli-\ngence that the story exemplifies. However, Goleman contextualises the\nTable 5.1.

Leave me\nalone I\u2019m a little prickly and\nirritable today.\nAnd I was standing there in my bubble\nwaiting for the bus and the bus\npulled up and I got on bubble intact.\nAnd the bus driver did something\nsurprising. He spoke to me. He\nactually spoke to me. He said hi how\nare you doing. I was taken aback.\nAnd I\u2019m waiting for the bus with my\nbubble intact, (Isolated audience\nlaughter) and it pulls up and I get\non careful to bring my bubble\nwith me and the bus driver does\nsomething really surprising. He\ntalks to me. (Isolated audience\nlaughter) He says hi how are\nyou doing? It\u2019s great to have\nyou on the bus. He really\nmeans it. (Isolated audience\nlaughter) I\u2019m shocked. (Light\naudience laughter)\nAnd I sat down, and I realised that this\nbus driver was carrying on a\ndialogue with everybody on the bus.\nOh you\u2019re looking for suits are yuh,\nwell you know there\u2019s a great sale in\nthis department store up here on the\nright, and did you hear about the\nmovies in the centreplex here on\nthe left, the one in cinema one isn\u2019t\nvery good.

In the first lecture he uses the\nstory to illustrate the fifth element of emotional intelligence, social skills,\nwhich he defines as handling emotions in relationships. In the second\nlecture, however, Goleman presents the story as depicting an event that\nchanged his life. Here, then, the story is afforded significantly more\nimportance than in the previous lecture. Whereas in the first lecture it\nwas presented as an illustration, on this occasion it is presented as an\naccount of an epiphanic experience, which was central to Goleman\nbecoming an advocate of the theory of emotional intelligence.\nAlthough the story is contextualised in different ways, the structure\nand wording of the two renditions are very similar. It is therefore\nnoticeable that the audience responses in the two lectures differ in\nimportant respects. In Lecture 1 the audience listens in silence until the\ncompletion of the story, at which point a handful of people laugh in\nresponse to Goleman\u2019s description of the exchanges between the bus\ndriver and his passengers. Then, following Goleman\u2019s post-story char-\nacterisation of the bus driver as an urban saint, a large number of\naudience members laugh out loud. The audience reactions to the story\nTable 5.1.

Here the conclusion of the\nstory evokes collective audience laughter, whereas Goleman\u2019s character-\nisation of the bus driver as an urban saint evokes only isolated laughter \u2013\nprecisely the reverse of the situation when the story was told in the earlier\nlecture. Notice also that earlier components of the story evoke either\nlaughter or isolated laughter, whereas before this was not the case. These\ndifferences result from the different ways in which Goleman relates the\nstory paralinguistically and kinesically in the two storytelling episodes.\nSpace considerations mean that it is not possible to look in detail at every\naspect of this, so we will concentrate on the end of the story, as this is key\nto understanding its function on these particular occasions.\nThe extracts in Table 5.1 comprise decontextualised transcripts of the\ntwo renditions of the story, which are akin to the data used in many\nmanagement studies of storytelling. In order to explain the different\nreactions of the audience members, however, it is necessary to consider\nthe storyteller\u2019s paralinguistic and visual actions as his two renditions of\nthe story unfold in real time.\nLecture 1\nAs Extract 5.1 shows, Goleman\u2019s reactions to the episodes of audience\nlaughter that follow his story and his subsequent assessment of the\ncentral character differ.\nExtract 5.1 [EI: 0.40.00]\n1 Gol: hh On and on and on like that..hh And people\n2 would get off that bus (.) and he\u2019d say well so\n3 long it\u2019s been great having you.=And they\u2019d say\n4 yea:h it\u2019s been great being on this bus.\n5 (.)\n6 Aud: h-h[-h-h h hh[h \u2013 h\n7 Gol: [That ma:n [was an urban saint.\n8 [Smile face->\n9 (.)

Instead he\nalmost immediately proceeds to characterise the bus driver as an \u2018urban\nsaint\u2019. However, Goleman does confirm the relevance of the laughter\nwhich follows this assessment of the bus driver by remaining silent until\nthis laughter starts to die away, at which point he starts to elaborate\nthe aspect of emotional intelligence that the story has been used to\nexemplify.\nFurther light can be shed on this storytelling episode by considering\nGoleman\u2019s visual conduct as he concludes his story and then charac-\nterises the central character as an urban saint. This reveals that\nGoleman\u2019s non-verbal actions operate to emphasise his assessment of\nthe bus driver\u2019s actions, rather than the story itself. They also illustrate\nhow Goleman recounts the story without any indication that it is\nintendedly humorous. He does not announce that it is a humorous\nstory, smile or use comedic\/incongruous paralinguistic cues or gestures,\nall actions that are routinely associated with the delivery of humorous\nmessages (Greatbatch and Clark 2003, 2005).\nAs Goleman describes the exchange between the passengers and the\nbus driver, he holds his arm out to the right, as his voice trails off to\nalmost a whisper (Figures 5.1a and 5.1b). Neither his speech delivery\nnor his bodily actions suggest that some form of collective response\nfrom the audience would be appropriate at this point. On the contrary,\nboth his tone of voice and his outstretched arm gesture indicate that he\nhas yet to complete the current unit of his talk.\nHowever, as Figures 5.1c\u20135.1f show, as soon as he begins to\ncharacterise the driver as an urban saint, Goleman\u2019s vocal and non-\nvocal actions combine to emphasise his message and thereby to\nmake it stand out from the preceding speech materials. In addition\nto speaking more loudly and forcibly, Goleman forms his fingers\ninto a pointing action (Figure 5.1c). He then rotates his arm and\nthrusts his outstretched finger(s) towards the audience (Figure 5.1d).\nSubsequently, Goleman lowers his arm so that by the time he\ncompletes his sentence he is pointing at the floor (Figures 5.1e\nand 5.1f).\nThus Goleman\u2019s tone and rhythmic delivery, together with his ges-\ntures, serve to mark out his characterisation of the bus driver as an\nurban saint as the punch line of the preceding story.

Moreover, in contrast to the preceding talk,\nGoleman\u2019s facial expression and paralinguistic actions are also consis-\ntent with the delivery of a humorous message, for he adopts a \u2018smile\nFigure 5.1a\nAnd they\u2019d say\nyea:h it\u2019s\nbeen great\nbeing on this bus.\nThat man\n(Isolated audience\nlaughter)\nFigure 5.1b\nFigure 5.1c\n106 David Greatbatch and Timothy Clark\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nface\u2019 \u2013 characterised by the upper lip being drawn back and the corners\nof themouth raised slightly, a slight puffing of the cheeks, brightening of\nthe eyes and creases under the eyes (Pollio, Mers and Lucchesi 1972) \u2013\nand a \u2018smile voice\u2019 \u2013 characterised by a noticeable increase in the\nfrequency and pitch of the speech (Shor 1978; Tartter 1989), which\nFigure 5.1d\nwas an\nurban\nSaint.\nFigure 5.1e\nFigure 5.1f\nThe situated production of stories 107\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nimbues his talk with a \u2018cheery resonance\u2019 (Lavin and Maynard 2001:\n467).

He delivers the story in a \u2018serious\u2019\nframe before shifting to a humorous frame and evoking laughter as he\ndelivers a positive assessment of the bus driver\u2019s actions.\nLecture 2\nBy the time of the second lecture Goleman was no longer wearing\nspectacles and had trimmed his beard. These are significant changes to\nhis facial appearance because they meant that the audience members\nwould be able to see his eyes and mouth more clearly than in the past;\nconsequently his facial expressions would be more clearly visible than\non previous occasions. This was perhaps linked to the fact that\nGoleman had also honed his style of public speaking, adopting a\nmuchmore energised, animated, forceful and vital style of public speak-\ning than in his previous lecture, including the use of more pronounced\nfacial expressions.\nAs noted earlier, in this lecture the conclusion to the story evokes\ncollective audience laughter, whereas the assessment of the bus driver\nevokes only isolated laughter \u2013 the reverse of what happened in Lecture 1.\nAs Extract 5.2 shows, Goleman treats the occurrence of laughter\nfollowing the story as relevant by pausing until the laughter starts to\ndie away.\nExtract 5.2 [EI2 \u2013 30:16]\n1 Gol: On and on and on.

(0.2) And we have\n13 this power no matter what we do (.) because it\u2019s how\n14 we do it that makes the difference\nAs can be seen, the wording of the conclusion of the story and the\nsubsequent assessment of the bus driver are virtually identical in\nthe two lectures. What is key to understanding the delivery of the\nstory on this occasion is the way in which Goleman shifts the\nemphases that he places on different elements of the storytelling\nepisode. In this case, he places much greater emphasis than before\non the concluding element of the story. Rather than channelling\naudience attention towards his characterisation of the bus driver as\nan urban saint, he presents the end of the story as a focal assertion\nand succeeds in evoking collective audience laughter in response\nto it.\nConsider Figures 5.2a\u20135.2e. In contrast to the first lecture,\nGoleman both highlights his depiction of the way in which passen-\ngers in the story responded to the bus driver as they got off the bus\n(\u2018And they\u2019d say it\u2019s been great being on this bus\u2019) and projects the\nrelevance of audience laughter upon its completion. Thus, as he\nbegins to quote the passengers, he leans towards the audience,\narms at his side (Figure 5.1a). Then, he lifts up both forearms before\nthrusting his hands downwards as he says \u2018great\u2019 (Figure 5.2b). As he\ncompletes the paraphrase he lowers his hands (Figure 5.2c) so that\nby the end of the story they are at his side, as he stands smiling at\nthe audience (Figure 5.2d). Together with his animated tone, these\nactions not only convey the nature of the passenger\u2019s reactions to the\nbus driver, but also imbue the story with a more humorous tone than\nwas the case in the first lecture. As the audience members laugh, he\nstands, relaxed, arms at his side, smiling at them without speaking\nand giving no indication that a resumption of his speaking is immi-\nnent, thereby confirming the relevance of the laughter (Figures 5.2d\nand 5.2e). Then, as can be seen in Figures 5.2f\u20135.2i, as the audience\nlaughter starts to fade, he leans forward slightly towards the audi-\nence, thrusts out his left leg towards them, lifts his forearms to chest\nlevel, and cups his hands as he characterises the bus driver as an\nurban saint.\n110 David Greatbatch and Timothy Clark\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nGoleman\u2019s paralinguistic and visual conduct, as he characterises the\nbus driver as an urban saint, differs from the first lecture in two impor-\ntant respects. First, in contrast to the first lecture, as he completes this\npost-story assessment of the bus driver, Goleman\u2019s paralinguistic and\nvisual conduct does not suggest that completion of the post-story assess-\nment will also represent completion of themessage he is in the process of\nFigure 5.2a\nAnd they\u2019d\nsay yeah\nit\u2019s been great\nbeing\nFigure 5.2b\nFigure 5.2c\nThe situated production of stories 111\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\ndelivering. Thus, whereas in Lecture 1 his gestures were consistent with\nmessage completion (recall how he lowered an outstretched arm\/finger\nso that by the time he completed the post-story assessment he was\npointing at the floor), in this case Goleman stands poised to continue\nspeaking. Moreover, whereas in the first lecture he voiced his assess-\nment with falling intonation, on this occasion he delivers the assessment\nFigure 5.2d\non this bus.\nYou know.\nAudience laughter\nThat ma:n\nFigure 5.2e\nFigure 5.2f\n112 David Greatbatch and Timothy Clark\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nwith rising intonation. This suggests that further talk may be imminent\nand that the message-in-progress is yet to be completed.\nThe second difference between the two renditions of the post-story\nassessment of the bus driver is that in Lecture 2Goleman does not signal\nhumorous intent by smiling and, although a handful of audience mem-\nbers do laugh, the overwhelming majority remain silent. Moreover, in\nFigure 5.2g\nthat man was\nan urban\nSaint?\nIsolated audience\nlaughter\nFigure 5.2h\nFigure 5.2i\nThe situated production of stories 113\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\ncontrast to the first lecture, Goleman subsequently gives no indication\nwhatsoever that laughter is a relevant response at this juncture. Instead,\nhe proceeds almost immediately to explainwhy the driver was an urban\nsaint and how the driver\u2019s actions provided him with a revelatory\ninsight into the importance of so-called emotional intelligence. Thus,\nGoleman does not present his post-story characterisation of the bus\ndriver as an urban saint as the humorous punch line of the story, as was\nthe case in his previous lecture; instead he embeds it in a \u2018serious\u2019\naccount of the lesson he learnt from the events he described in his story.\nIn summary, Goleman\u2019s paralinguistic and visual actions serve to\nformulate the story and post-story assessment in very different ways\nin the two lectures. In the first lecture, Goleman channels the audience\u2019s\nattention towards, and evokes audience laughter in response to, his\npost-story characterisation of the bus driver as an urban saint.\nHowever, in the second lecture he adopts a different tack. Specifically,\nhe invites (and subsequently confirms the relevance of) collective audi-\nence laughter in response to the final element of the story, before shifting\nto a \u2018serious\u2019 footing as he depicts the bus driver as an urban saint\nduring the course of delivering a broader message which (1) contextua-\nlises the driver\u2019s actions in terms of the theory of emotional intelligence\nand (2) identifies the wider impact the driver\u2019s actions had on his own\nthinking. In other words, it is the story itself that is framed as humorous,\nrather than the storyteller\u2019s post-story assessment of the central char-\nacter\u2019s actions. Thus, in the first case, the story is embedded in an\nargument structure in which it is positioned as a prefatory component\npreceding a punch line, which comprises the storyteller\u2019s assessment of\nthe central character\u2019s actions; in the second case the final element of the\nstory itself is formulated as the punch line, while the post-story assess-\nment of the driver\u2019s actions is embedded within a \u2018non-humorously\u2019\nformatted message which distils the lesson to be learnt from the story.\nThese differences in Goleman\u2019s paralinguistic and visual conduct are\ndue at least in part to the fact that he uses the same story in different\nways in the two lectures. In the first lecture, Goleman uses the story\nmerely to illustrate a dimension of emotional intelligence, whereas in the\nsecond lecture he presents the story as depicting an epiphanicmoment in\nhis life. This is a significant shift in emphasis, with the story now being\npresented as leading to his \u2018conversion\u2019 to the set of ideas concerning\nemotional intelligence that he is conveying to this audience. The story is\nno longer just an example; it is an account of a life-changing revelatory\n114 David Greatbatch and Timothy Clark\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nexperience. By presenting the final element in the story as a punch line,\nand inviting audience laughter at that point, Goleman highlights and\nemphasises the remarkable quality of the incident (Greatbatch and\nClark 2002, 2003, 2005). He also imbues the events depicted in the\nstory with more significance than was the case in the previous lecture\nbecause on this occasion he does not channel the audience\u2019s attention\ntowards his post-story assessment of the bus driver. Goleman\u2019s vocal\nand non-vocal actions thus place greater emphasis on the actions of the\nbus driver and his passengers than was the case in the previous lecture.\nThis perhaps serves to underline the epiphanic aspects of the storytelling\nepisode in this lecture. The performance-based aspects of the storytell-\ning episodes are thus key to understanding the specific functions of\nGoleman\u2019s \u2018urban saint\u2019 story when he recounts it in the two lectures.\nDiscussion\nDespite Boje\u2019s (1991) cogent critique, the \u2018story-as-texts\u2019 approach\ncontinues as a major stream in storytelling research in organisational\nstudies. Thus, for example, recent studies of storytelling within organi-\nsations have adopted such an approach, drawing on stories gleaned in\ninterviews and participant observation (e.g. Gabriel 1995, 2000;\nMoeran 2007). Our analysis of Goleman\u2019s rendition of the same story\non two different occasions underlines the problems with the \u2018stories-as-\ntexts\u2019 paradigm, which treats stories as entities removed from their\nperformative context and which conceptualises storytelling as a process\nin which the meaning is fixed (by the teller) and remains relatively stable\nand static across tellings. A decontextualised transcript of a story may\ngive a very different impression of the production and reception it\nreceived from the audience when told live. As we have seen, a story\n(or component of a story) that looks serious on paper may receive a\nhumorous response from members of an audience or vice versa.\nMoreover, the same story may be used and interpreted in different\nways on different occasions. The performance-based aspects of story-\ntelling episodes \u2013 especially paralinguistic and visual cues \u2013 are thus key\nin relation to understanding the functions of stories. We cannot there-\nfore assume that the nature of the events recounted in a story has a fixed\nand final significance. Stories may be presented, interpreted and\nreceived in different ways, even though the wording may be very similar\nor even identical.\nThe situated production of stories 115\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nIn addition to illustrating the importance of paralinguistic and kinesic\nactions in storytelling episodes, this chapter also shows how stories\nemerge through a process of interaction between storytellers and story\nrecipients.

Thus, for example,\nlittle if any consideration is given to how the delivery and content of\nstories are shaped in response to the immediate reactions of recipients,\nor how storytellers elicit displays of approval from recipients, or how\nrecipients\u2019 reactions are evoked, co-ordinated and managed. Even those\nstudies that have focused on audio\/video recordings of real-world story-\ntelling episodes have overlooked storyteller\/recipient interaction, invol-\nving instead either textual analysis of decontextualised transcripts or\nspeaker-focused analyses, which do not consider how stories unfold in\nreal time and emerge out of a process of interaction between storytellers\nand recipients (e.g. Greatbatch and Clark 2003, 2005).\nIn this chapter we have illustrated how stories are embedded within\nand arise out of interactions between speakers and listeners, and how\nthis is key to understanding the significance and in situ meaning of\nstories, the extent storytellers and recipients display shared understand-\nings of stories, when and where story recipients respond and so on.\nThus, for example, our analysis of the storytelling episodes involving\nGoleman underlines that collective laughter is not simply a spontaneous\nreaction to stories whose content is self-evidently humorous, but rather\nis often evoked by storytellers through the use of a range of verbal and\nnon-verbal practices. By varying his visual and paralinguistic conduct,\nGoleman stresses and invites collective laughter in response to different\ncomponents in the two storytelling episodes. Goleman\u2019s paralinguistic\nand visual actions do not merely embellish and enliven his narration of\nthe story; they are key to establishing the story\u2019s in situ meaning and\nsignificance, and projecting and co-ordinating appropriate collective\naudience responses on each occasion. Furthermore, what our analysis\nindicates is that whether a story is good, bad, successful or unsuccessful\nis not due to a number of essential and stable ingredients (Gabriel 2000;\nTaylor, Fisher and Dufresne 2002). Rather the various elements that\ncombine to create the \u2018aesthetic experience\u2019 (Taylor, Fisher and\nDufresne 2002) and underpin any subsequent evaluation of a story\nare themselves in situ accomplishments. As we have shown, differences\nin the use of paralinguistic and kinesic cues influence the immediate\n116 David Greatbatch and Timothy Clark\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nreception of a story and may therefore influence any future views as to\nits effectiveness.\nConsidering the interactional dimensions of storytelling also reveals\nthe importance of story recipients\u2019 conduct during the course of story-\ntelling episodes, and the ways in which stories represent joint accom-\nplishments, involving both storytellers and story recipients. In the cases\nconsidered in this chapter, audience members are not passive recipients\nof a story whose meaning is straightforwardly determined and trans-\nmitted to them by the storyteller. This becomes especially apparent\nwhen we consider how audience members display competing under-\nstandings of the urban saint story and Goleman\u2019s post-story assessment\nof the bus driver\u2019s actions, and how the storyteller subsequently tacitly\naccepts some displayed understandings but not others. In the first\nlecture, only a handful of audience members laugh upon completion\nof the story, whereas most, if not all, laugh following the storyteller\u2019s\nsubsequent assessment of the central character. While the storyteller\n(Goleman) tacitly disconfirms the relevance of the isolated laughter\nfollowing the story by proceeding immediately to produce the assess-\nment, he tacitly confirms the relevance of laughter following the post-\nstory assessment by ceding the floor until the laughter starts to die away.\nIn the second case, most audience members laugh following the story,\nwhereas only a few laugh following the storyteller\u2019s post-story assess-\nment. Here, in contrast to the first lecture, the storyteller treats the\noccurrence of audience laughter following the story as relevant, by\nceding the floor, but tacitly disconfirms the relevance of laughter follow-\ning the post-story assessment by continuing to speak after the first few\nbeats of laughter (rather than, for example, remaining silent in expecta-\ntion that the isolated laughter will lead to full laughter). All of this\noccurs in real time, as the story emerges out of the moment-by-moment\nactions and reactions of the storyteller and story recipients on two\nseparate occasions. The status of the story and the post-story assessment\nas humorous or non-humorous is negotiated in situ and is not embodied\nin the words used by the speaker. The completion of the story and the\npost-story assessment involve the use of almost identical wording on the\ntwo occasions, with the differing interpretive frameworks and reactions\nresting on the storyteller\u2019s use of different paralinguistic and visual cues.\nThe key message of this chapter is that the nature, meaning and\nsignificance of stories (and specific incidents within them) are achieved\nin situ and that paralinguistic and visual cues play an important role in\nThe situated production of stories 117\nDownloaded from Cambridge Books Online by IP 129.234.252.67 on Wed May 25 09:32:32 BST 2011.\nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1017\/CBO9780511676512.006\nCambridge Books Online \u00a9 Cambridge University Press, 2011\nthis process. Approaches that analyse stories using decontextualised\ntranscripts are therefore misconceived. It is only by studying stories in\nnatural contexts, as they emerge in real-time interactions between story-\ntellers and story recipients, that we can grasp their roles and significance\nin organisational (and other) settings.
