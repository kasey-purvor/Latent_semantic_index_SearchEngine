To illustrate this we investigate mass loading\nthrough radial profile variations in the Alfven velocity (VA).\nResults show that the gradient in r and VA across the\nplasmapause is modified when mass loading due to multiple\nheavy ion species is included, particularly in the presence of\nthe O+ torus. Application to ultra-low frequency (ULF) field\nline resonance is used as an example where the contribution\nfrom heavy ions smoothes out the expected ULF wave\nresonant frequency discontinuity at the plasmapause.\nCitation: Fraser, B.

Introduction\n[2] Properties of the cold plasma in the Earth\u2019s magneto-\nsphere divide the cavity into two distinct regions, the\nplasmasphere and the plasmatrough. In the high-density\nplasmasphere inner region (102\u2013104 cm\u00013) with its outer\nboundary at the plasmapause (L = 3\u20135), geomagnetic flux\ntube trajectories corotate with the Earth under the influence\nof the corotation electric field creating a closed region\n[Nishida, 1966]. Flux tube trajectories further out are\ndominated by the magnetospheric convection electric field\nand intersect the dayside magnetopause. These flux tubes\nbecome open at the magnetopause and the plasmatrough\nflux tubes have low density (1\u201310 cm\u00013). The plasmapause\nideally supports a zero electric field singular point at\n1800 LT and the plasmapause bulge region between noon\nand midnight, depending on geomagnetic activity and\nconvection. The plasmapause density gradient can be very\nsteep at most local times, with the exception of the bulge\nregion in the dusk sector which may show more gradual\nslope and multiple plasmaspheric structures [Horwitz et al.,\n1990; Carpenter et al., 2000]. Convection in the plasma-\ntrough is unsteady, mainly due to substorm activity. When\nconvection decreases the corotating flux tubes are extended\nbeyond the plasmapause and the new corotating tubes are\nrefilled with plasma of ionospheric origin. Also, tails or\nplumes may drift sunward from the plasmapause towards\nnoon and provide density enhancements in the plasma-\ntrough [Chappell et al., 1971; Carpenter et al., 1993].\nConsequently, the radial plasma density profile in the\nmagnetosphere, including the plasmapause, may show con-\nsiderable variability [Horwitz et al., 1990; Singh and\nHorwitz, 1992; Carpenter et al., 2000]. Results from the\nIMAGE spacecraft have provided more insight into the\nazimuthal topology of the plasmasphere and the plasma-\npause. For example, the Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) in-\nstrument has recently confirmed the existence of plasma\ntails, fingers, biteouts and shoulders [Sandel et al., 2001].\n[3] The radial ion plasma density profile, typically used\nto display the presence of the plasmapause, is generally\ndeduced from electron or H+ ion measurements [Carpenter\nand Anderson, 1992; Chappell et al., 1970]. Recently\nthe dynamics of the plasmapause have been studied using\nthe IMAGE EUV instrument which indirectly measures the\ntotal column density of He+ ions [Burch et al., 2001]. It is\nimportant to intercompare these different measurements in\norder to define their response at the plasmapause and in the\nplasmasphere. Ion composition measurements have shown\nHe+ is the second most abundant ion in the plasmasphere,\nafter H+, with an average relative concentration of 20%, but\nis sometimes comparable to that of H+ [Newberry et al.,\n1989]. Just inside the plasmapause heavy ion (O+, O++ and\nN+) densities have been found to increase by a factor of\n10 or more when there is no corresponding variation in H+\nor He+ ions. This is commonly called the oxygen torus due\nto the dominance of oxygen ions [Roberts et al., 1987].\nHorwitz et al. [1984] showed that the ion composition in the\nplasmasphere and near the plasmapause is highly variable\nand typically includes H+, He+, He++, O+ and O++ ions.\nTherefore, mass loading will vary radially and the assump-\ntion of a constant mass loading, as assumed by Moore et al.\n[1987] and Fraser et al. [1988] and others in the past, is not\nappropriate. In this paper the plasmapause is identified as a\nsharp radial gradient in the H+ density profile.\n[4] A wide variety of hydromagnetic waves propagate in\nthe Earth\u2019s plasmasphere and magnetosphere. Spacecraft\nobservations on the dayside of toroidal mode standing\nAlfven waves show a decrease in field line resonant\nfrequencies with increasing radial distance from the Earth,\nand the presence of harmonic structure over L = 3\u20139\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 32, L04102, doi:10.1029\/2004GL021315, 2005\n1CRC for Satellite Systems, Mathematical and Physical Sciences,\nUniversity of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.\n2Department of Physics, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington,\nTexas, USA.\n3NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre, Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.\n4Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta,\nCanada.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/05\/2004GL021315$05.00\nL04102 1 of 4\n[Engebretson et al., 1986; Takahashi and Anderson, 1992].\nThe extent to which plasma mass density near the plasma-\npause affects ULF field line resonance characteristics is not\nunderstood. The approximate wave resonant frequency and\nharmonics can be simply calculated by integration along a\nfield line using T = 1\/f \u0002 R (VA)\u00011ds where the Alfven\nvelocity VA = B(s)[(mor(s)]\n\u00011\u00022 is the characteristic wave\nvelocity and is dependent on the plasma mass density and the\ngeomagnetic field flux density along the field line (s).\nConsideration of the radial variation in VA can therefore\nprovide insight into the resonant structure of the magneto-\nsphere. The populations of cool\/cold heavy ions (He+, O+) in\naddition to protons and electrons introduces a mass loading\nfactor to the plasma ion density since r = Smini, where mi\nand ni are the mass and number density respectively, of the\nith ion species.\n[5] The primary aim of this paper is to include heavy ion\ncontributions in the radial mass loaded plasma density\nprofile and show an example of the resulting r and VA\nprofiles. Data is from the Dynamics Explorer (DE-1) space-\ncraft, in a near polar orbit with 7.5hr period, apogee 4.65Re\nand perigee 570 km. Plasma data is from the retarding ion\nmass spectrometer (RIMS) experiment [Chappell et al.,\n1981] and geomagnetic field data from the magnetic field\nexperiment [Farthing et al., 1981]. As an example illustrat-\ning the importance of ion composition and mass loading,\nthe resulting VA profiles are then incorporated in calculations\nof ULF wave field line resonance harmonic structure fol-\nlowing techniques used by Orr and Webb [1975] and Fraser\net al. [1988].\n2. Plasma Density, Mass Loading, and Alfven\nVelocity Profiles\n[6] An important study on the replenishment of the outer\nplasmasphere following a geomagnetic storm using DE-1\ncold multi-ion plasma density profiles was reported by\nHorwitz et al. [1984]. A sequence of five consecutive DE-1\ndusk passes on 12, 13 November 1981, were shown where\nmagnetic activity decreased gradually from Kp = 7 at 03\u2013\n06 UT on 12 November to Kp = 0\u20131 at 18 UT on 13\nNovember. During the period of quieting, the region outside\nL \u0002 4 extending to L \u0002 7 began to refill and a new outer\nplasmasphere formed. An enhanced O+ population compa-\nrable to H+ was also observed.\n[7] In the present study we use the DE-1 RIMS multi-ion\ndensity data for one of the passes on 12 November 1981,\nbetween 1646\u20131715 UT, along with the corresponding\nmeasured geomagnetic field, to calculate the VA profile\nand field line resonance harmonic structure over L = 1.5\u20135.\nHere DE-1, over 1924\u20131948 LT, was located at 0.4\u0004\u201343.6\u0004\ngeomagnetic latitude and at an altitude of 1.5\u20132.4 Re. The\nradial density profiles of the five species H+, He+, He++, O+\nand O++ are plotted in panel C of Figure 2 by Horwitz et al.\n[1984]. This panel is reproduced here in Figure 1a, where\nthe intrusion of new cold plasma during plasmasphere\nrefilling is seen in H+ and He+ densities over L = 2.5\u20134.\nIn this region O+ is enhanced to an extent that it sometimes\nexceeds the H+ density. This is the so-called heavy ion\n\u2018\u2018torus\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018shell\u2019\u2019 in the vicinity of the plasmapause\n[Roberts et al., 1987; Singh and Horwitz, 1992]. Errors in\ndensity may be a factor of two for densities <100 cm\u00013 and\nare not considered. Figure 1b shows mass loaded density\nprofiles for the two component (H+, He+) and three com-\nponent (H+, He+, O+) plasmas, with the single ion H+ profile\nplotted for comparison. The inclusion of He+ doubles the\ndensity over L = 3\u20134 while the further addition of O+\nincreases it by over one order of magnitude and essentially\neliminates the plasmapause at L \u0002 2.5. VA profiles, calcu-\nlated from the multi-ion mass loaded plasma density profiles\nin Figure 1b and the corresponding DE-1 magnetic field\nradial profile data are plotted in Figure 2. The shape of the\nVA profiles for the (H\n+, He+) and (H+, He+, O+) density\nprofiles are significantly different with the latter showing an\norder of magnitude decrease over L \u0002 2\u20134.5, primarily due\nto the mass loading of the O+ torus ions.\n3. Field Line Resonance\n[8] The increase in mass loading resulting from the\npresence of significant populations of He+ and O+ ions\nhas a profound effect on the ULF wave field line resonance\n(FLR) harmonic structure, as shown in Figure 3. Here the\neigenfrequencies of the first three harmonics were computed\nFigure 1a. Radial variation in ion density of five species\non one DE-1 inbound pass on November 12, 1981.\nFigure 1b. Mass loaded ion densities for two combination\nof ion species compared with the H+ density.\nL04102 FRASER ET AL.: HEAVY ION MASS LOADING L04102\n2 of 4\nfollowing the techniques of Cummings et al. [1969] and\nOrr and Matthew [1971]. A dipole magnetic field and a\nmagnetosphere plasma density power law variation r = ro\n(Re)\n\u0001m with m = 3, are assumed [Fraser et al., 1988]. For the\n(H+, He+) plasma, the expected decrease in resonant fre-\nquency with increasing radial distance is seen out to L\u0002 2.5.\nThe presence of the plasmapause prior to refilling at this\nlocation, and the decrease in density of the H+ and He+ ions\nout to L \u0002 4 creates a region of increased FLR frequencies.\nFor example, the fundamental frequency of 15 mHz at L =\n2.5, increases to 40 mHz at L = 3.3. The second and third\nharmonics increase proportionally (Figure 3a). The inclusion\nof O+ in the computation almost completely suppresses the\nincrease in resonance frequency across the plasmapause\n(Figure 3b). A significant frequency increase occurs beyond\nL = 4 where the O+ density decreases. Throughout the study\nthe contributions of He++ and O++ ions have been neglected.\n4. Discussion\n[9] The above example shows that the H+ radial plasma\ndensity profile cannot always be assumed representative\nof the total ion density profile, especially near the plasma-\npause. The same argument may apply to the use of electron\ndensity profiles. An example highlighting this effect was\npresented by Z. C. Dent et al. (Plasmaspheric depletion,\nrefilling and plasmapause dynamics: A coordinated ground-\nbased and IMAGE satellite study, submitted to Journal of\nGeophysical Research, 2005; hereinafter referred to as Dent\net al., submitted manuscript, 2005) assuming a dipole\nmagnetic field and a radial m = 3 plasma density distribu-\ntion. Plasma mass density, calculated from ULF field line\nresonance frequencies determined from SAMNET [Yeoman\net al., 1990], IMAGE [Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998] and British\nGeological Survey [BGS; http:\/\/www.dcs.lancs.ac.uk\/iono\/\nsamnet\/] ground-based magnetometer observations using\nthe cross-phase technique [Waters et al., 1991] were com-\npared to in-situ IMAGE satellite Radio Plasma Imager (RPI)\ndetermined electron number density values. In Figure 4 the\ncross-phase determined plasma mass density profile has a\nless steep plasmapause gradient than the sharp RPI deter-\nmined electron number density profile at L \u0002 3. This day,\n14 May 2001, followed a depletion episode and Dent et al.\ninferred that the differing profiles through the plasmatrough\nregion resulted from an enhanced heavy ion population.\nThere was an excellent ground-satellite conjunction during\nthis interval with the two data sets representing the same UT\nFigure 2.

Consequently, azimuthal variation of\nplasma density is an unlikely explanation for the observed\ndifferences in electron (RPI) and total mass density profiles\nat the plasmapause. The observed (using the cross-phase\ntechnique) FLR frequency profile, and that calculated from\nthe RPI data assuming a H+ plasma and using the same\nmethod as in the above section (not shown), shows a\nsuppressed increase of frequency through the plasmapause\nwhen heavy ions are accounted for (i.e., in the cross-phase\nprofile) as compared to when they are not (i.e., the RPI\nprofile), in agreement with the results presented in Figure 3.\n[10] This application illustrates the importance of choos-\ning the relevant plasma density profile for the particular\napplication under study. The electron density profiles derived\nfrom upper hybrid resonances on numerous spacecraft [e.g.,\nAnderson et al., 1992] are important in VLF studies involv-\ning electron cyclotron waves. On the other hand ULF\nhydomagnetic and ion cyclotron waves propagate in an\nambient ion plasma usually dominated by H+ ions, but with\na significant contribution from heavy ions including He+ and\nO+. The use of electron density in propagation and resonance\nstudies of these waves is therefore invalid with the exception\nof the special case where heavy ions are absent.\n[11] The DE-1 pass reported here is only one example of\n8 passes observed in the DE-1 data set over October\u2013\nNovember 1981 which showed significant heavy ion mass\nloading effects. Results from these observations on different\ndays over a wide range of magnetic conditions suggest that\nVA will show the expected increase at the plasmapause and\nthe corresponding decrease in ULFwave frequency. If a steep\nplasmapause is observed in the H+ and He+ ions, and the O+\ncontribution is minimal, as shown in Figure 1b, then resonant\nstructures similar to Figure 3a, with a sudden frequency\nincrease at the plasmapause will be observed. However, the\npresence of an O+ torus may flatten the VA profile at the\nplasmapause due to O+ refilling and remove this frequency\nincrease.\n[12] In conclusion, this preliminary study emphasizes the\nimportance of heavy ion mass loading in plasmapause and\nplasmasphere density studies. With respect to hydromagnetic\nwaves it is important to use mass loaded densities in order to\nlocate the plasmapause accurately and calculate meaningful\nFLR radial frequency profiles in the plasmasphere. Here the\nmass density profile may be significantly different from that\nindicated by the electron or H+ density profile. With the wide\nvariety of plasmaspheric and magnetospheric spacecraft\nplasma density data currently available it is important to\nuse the appropriate data for the application under study and\nundertake inter-comparisons with care.\n[13] Acknowledgments.
