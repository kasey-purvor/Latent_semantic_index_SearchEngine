The article \ninvestigates this zoonotic hazard in an historical context and reflects on the nature of \npublic reactions to such risk. It concludes that food scares have been with us for at least \n150 years and that consumer responses in terms of changes in demand have been \ncomplex. \n \nKeywords:  Zoonotic disease; Food scares; Food history \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nZoonoses are diseases that can be passed to humans from animals and this article is \nabout their mediation by the food supply. The zoonotic hazard overall has been growing \nin the UK since the mid-nineteenth century due to a number of factors, and the present \npaper is about the variety of public responses to this threat. It is a topic that has regularly \nhit the headlines in the last twenty years or so, but there is only a limited literature to help \nus think about the safety of livestock products in the past and to give an historical \ndimension to the contemporary debate about diseases such as Bovine Spongiform \nEncephalopathy (BSE).  \nRather than reconstructing patterns of disease or describing their health impact, five \ndiscourses will be considered that indicate the dimensions of public concern. These are \nways in which zoonoses have been discussed and perceived by society at large and they \nare means for us to analyse long-term trends. Several of the themes overlap or intersect \nwith each other. \n \n \n 3\nEarly risk attitudes and the media \n \nIn this initial section we will discuss three ways of looking at risk in the late \nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries. First, there is the active risk-confronting attitude \nof the Victorians and Edwardians which can be seen in their writings about improving \nconditions of work in factories, upgrading slum housing, or building sewers (Freedgood, \n2000). This social and sanitarian vision included concern for the food supply and there \nwere attempts, for instance, to reduce adulteration through legislation, starting with the \nSale of Food & Drugs Acts of 1860, 1872 and 1875 (French & Phillips, 2000).  \nSecond, some animal-related risks had the characteristics of being socially \nconstructed. Rabies, for instance, was a high-profile disease from the 1870s onwards \n(Walton, 1979). Mortality was minimal but the particularly painful and unpleasant \nmanner of death from \u2018hydrophobia\u2019 caught the public imagination and led to calls for \ndog muzzling in the streets and the quarantining of imported pets. Glanders and farcy, \ntwo variants of a bacterial horse disease, were also a source of what, in retrospect, seems \nto have been exaggerated public fear. According to Anne Hardy, the deaths in London of \ntwo ostlers\u2019 wives in 1892 from the human form of glanders caused \u2018public panic\u2019 and \nwere the spur for its eradication as a public health risk (Hardy, 2002). The fear was \ngenerated by media attention and a content analysis of newspapers such as The Times \nwould show an increasing trend over the last 150 years in the reporting of zoonotic food \nscares. There is no space here for a full treatment but we may hypothesise that the trend is \nas much related to structural changes in the media as it is to any real increase in the risk \nof consuming animal foods. One writer (Beardsworth, 1990) argues that modern food \nscares have many of the characteristics of \u2018moral panics,\u2019 and their genealogy can \ntherefore be traced back to the sensational popular reporting of the late Victorian period, \nwhich in some forms has survived in today\u2019s tabloids.  \nNovels are potentially also a source of public information, perhaps the best example \nbeing Upton Sinclair\u2019s The Jungle, written as an expos\u00e9 of the appalling conditions in the \nChicago Stockyards (Sinclair, 1906). There was revulsion on both sides of the Atlantic \nfor the large-scale industrial slaughtering that Sinclair described, and little imagination \nwas required to guess at the low quality of food that it produced. An immediate loss of \n 4\nBritish consumer confidence in American canned meats caused a mini-crisis and gave \nministers the momentum they needed to push tightened food regulations through \nparliament (the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907). \nThird, there was a quantifiably significant set of hazards in consuming meat and milk \nup until the mid-twentieth century. The highest risk was from bovine tuberculosis, which \nis estimated to have been responsible for over 800,000 deaths in the UK between 1850 \nand 1960 (Atkins, 2000a), probably the largest food-related zoonotic mortality in history. \nThis disease did not cause panic, however, because it was insidious, with outward \nsymptoms similar to those of human, pulmonary tuberculosis. (The main differences \nwere a high incidence among babies and young children fed on cow\u2019s milk, and infection \nin sites away from the lungs.) Discursive characteristics of this disease included a high \ndegree of scientific controversy and an astonishingly fierce public debate about \ntechnologies such as pasteurization that offered a preventative solution. There was also \ndispute about appropriate policies of interventionist governance. Here were many of the \nfeatures of indeterminacy that are recognisable in recent discussions about BSE \n(Hinchliffe, 2001). \n \nBeastly foods \n \nTo many Victorian observers, the presence of zoonoses was evidence of nature out of \ncontrol, sometimes in the very heart of their rapidly growing cities. There was nothing \nnew in epidemic livestock disease but the large-scale \u2018murrains\u2019 that swept through town \ndairies in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were somehow symbolic of the need to \npurify \u2018the urban\u2019 from animal externalities: their smell, their manure, their blood. An \nintervention of great significance came in 1866 with the compulsory slaughter of animals \ninfected with the \u2018cattle plague\u2019 or rinderpest. This demonstrated that such diseases were \nsusceptible to policy, and central and local authorities were encouraged to introduce \ncontrols, for example the various Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts. Also, in the \ntwenty years or so before the First World War, planning measures imposed restrictions on \nthe last urban livestock farmers, notably through strict hygiene requirements. Ironically, \n 5\nthis seems to have increased the zoonotic hazard because production shifted to rural \nareas, where regulations and enforcement were lax. \n \nBlame the consumer \n \nA common discursive refrain, particularly in the nineteenth and early twentieth \ncenturies, was criticism of the consumers of livestock products. From time to time they \nwere accused of ignorance and lack of interest in high quality, disease-free meat and \nmilk. Politicians and food industrialists were patronizing or simply dismissive of their \nintelligence and intentions, for instance as measured in their lack of willingness to pay for \nclean, pure milk in the early days of certified and graded milk in the 1920s. In 1933 Sir \nFrederick Hobday, Principal of the Royal Veterinary College, thus asked how it was \npossible that there was still tuberculosis in milk.   \n\u2018The answer lies mainly in the apathy of the general public which does not appear \nto wish, nor does it care, to know whether the milk is from a tuberculosis-free \nherd, nor will it as a body pay a small sum extra per quart in order to ensure that \nthe milk is obtained from \u2026 a \u201ctubercle-free\u201d herd (Hobday, 1933, 451). \n \nThis elitist view of expertise was common. Knowledge was seen to be vested in \nprofessions, such as that of veterinary surgeon. Consumers needed to be guided, educated \nand, above all, persuaded. Evidence from the USA and the UK suggests that the early \ndecades of the twentieth century saw a step-change in attempts by food industries to \nshape the opinions of their customers. Protecting the reputation of corporate brands was \none motive but there was also advertising and public relations activity by trade \nassociations anxious to construct a positive image of their particular commodity. A good \nexample of the latter was the National Milk Publicity Campaign, which from 1920 \nonwards sought to boost milk consumption. In addition, the many food campaigning \norganizations in civil society, such as the National Clean Milk Society (1915-28), also \ncontributed to moulding opinion through the construction of positive images. \nDespite this model of top-down knowledge communication, consumer citizenship, \ndefined as active participation in institution- and market-shaping, was nevertheless \n 6\nevident in the increasing numbers of societies and associations that campaigned for \nunadulterated food, wholemeal bread, vegetarianism, unpasteurized milk, or a minimum \ndietary standard for children. Some were inspired by mystic or political ideologies, some \nby the new science of vitamins, and others by a romantic vision of pre-industrial, \nwholesome food (Atkins, 2000b). The situation was fragmented, however, and difficult to \ncharacterise because consumers did not necessarily share common interests, modes of \nconsumption, or health outcomes.  \n \nFood poisoning scares \n \nThe argument in this fourth section is complex. On the one hand we are told by risk \nsociety theorists (Beck, 1992) that modern food scares are emblematic of a loss of public \ntrust in the institutions designed to uphold food safety. Consumers certainly seem to have \ngreater concerns than, say, thirty years ago about the healthiness of their diet and have \nswitched certain habits, for instance away from full-fat milk because of worries about \nheart disease. On the other hand, the evidence of long-term dietary change being linked to \nspecific food poisoning scares or other zoonotic diseases is surprisingly thin.  \nIf one was to rely solely on the media for information about food, it would be \ntempting to assume that food poisoning has been a major problem, particularly of the late \ntwentieth century. Official data indicate a rising trend for campylobacter, salmonella, E. \ncoli O157, cryptosporidium and other food-poisoning incidents.  But there is more than \none possible interpretation of these statistics. \nFirst, it could be that these \u2018trends\u2019 bear little relation to the real prevalence of \nfood poisoning but rather are a function of the efficiency of data collection. There is some \nevidence in support of this claim. A large and carefully structured recent survey of 9776 \npatients in England found that only one in 136 cases of \u2018infectious intestinal disease\u2019 is \nrecorded in the national database and that only one in six ever comes to the notice of a \nmedical practitioner (Wheeler et al., 1999).  \nSecond, there is room for debate about the common assertion that there has been \nan upsurge of virulent new strains of infective agents and that these are responsible for \nthe rise in food poisoning. Salmonella, for instance, did not cause concern in the egg \n 7\nindustry until 1956 (Cooter & Fulton, 2001). Schlundt argues that enteritidis, the most \nserious of the salmonella serovars for food poisoning \u2018appeared simultaneously around \nthe world in the 1980s\u2019 (Schlundt et al., 2004, 53). This has been called \u2018the S. Enteritidis \npandemic\u2019 and is attributed to transfer via chick embryos (Thorns, 2000). But an \nalternative view is that these infections have always been present and only recently have \nthey have been connected with measurable outbreaks. Thus, Anne Hardy thinks that the \nfirst acceleration of food poisoning on a large scale came in the nineteenth century \n(Hardy, 1999). This was reported only sporadically at first and then, from the 1880s \nonwards, more systematically by local Medical Officers of Health, some of whom took a \nscientific interest in outbreaks, while others were looking for areas of public health on \nwhich to stamp their authority. At first, meat and seafood, especially shellfish, were seen \nto be susceptible to \u2018decay\u2019. Only later did it become obvious that micro-organisms were \nresponsible for alarming large-scale outbreaks of illness, especially once bacteriologists \nwere employed as epidemiological detectives. Food poisoning was only made notifiable \nin 1949, and from 1981 salmonella was reported separately.  One or other of these dates \ntends to be used as the \u2018year zero\u2019 in historical commentaries. \nA third interpretation is that the data are a reflection of the post-war \nintensification of the British food system and the public\u2019s continuing demand for cheap \nfood rather than for quality. Together these powerful forces are said to be responsible for \nthe build-up of a reservoir of infection that will be difficult to eliminate, and that in terms \nof both environmental damage and animal welfare such intensive agriculture is not \nsustainable.  \nFourth, the upsurge in food poisoning may be correlated with kitchen \ntechnologies such as refrigerators, deep freezers, microwave ovens (Oddy, 2003). Food \npreparers may not have fully appreciated the need for the thorough defrosting and \ncooking of individual items, or understood the importance of use-by dates on cook-chill \nproducts. The problem with this explanation is that once again it is a critique of consumer \ncompetence, as discussed above. \nThe problem of salmonella in eggs and chicken in the 1980s was thrown into relief by \nan extraordinary political event \u2013 one that had a major impact, in the short-term, upon \nconsumption and in the long-term upon public awareness of food safety. In December \n 8\n1988 junior Health Minister, Edwina Currie, announced that \u2018most of the egg production \nof this country, sadly, is now infected with salmonella.\u2019 The consequences were severe. \nThe consumption of eggs fell for a short period by 50 per cent and eventually Mrs Currie \nwas forced to resign, having told the truth in an \u2018impolitic\u2019 manner (Smith, 1991; North \n& Gorman, 1990). Some writers have seen the crisis the start of the era of manufactured \ncrises. True or not, the incident had virtually no long-term impact on consumption. This \nis clear from the historical series of the National Food Survey, which shows a decline in \negg intake starting in the mid-1960s and continuing steadily to the present. On this curve \nthe salmonella incident appears as little more than a blip. \n \nDread risk \n \nDread risks are events that we perceive (even if incorrectly) to be beyond our \ninfluence and therefore uncontrollable. The public\u2019s reaction against the introduction of \ngenetically modified foods sits in this category, as does BSE. \nBSE was first diagnosed in Britain in November 1986 in cattle that had developed \nuncontrollable staggers that were clearly due to neurological impairment. The symptoms \nwere similar to those in other Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, for example \nscrapie in sheep. Soon thousands of cattle were affected, then tens of thousands, and \nultimately 1.5 million. The epidemic reached its peak early in 1993 and in March 1996 \nthe Secretary of State for Health, Stephen Dorrell, announced in the House of Commons \nthat a link was possible between two prion diseases: BSE and New Variant Creutzfeldt-\nJacob Disease (vCJD) in humans. \nDespite a great deal of controversy, explanations of the outbreak are relatively \nstraightforward.  In 1981 the government had relaxed controls on the rendering industry \nand, for various technical reasons, this facilitated the recycling of infective material in \nprotein-rich cattle feed. Only wholly grass-fed herds were therefore spared the challenge \nof BSE. Once this was realized, in 1988, a ban was introduced on offal in feed, and the \nfollowing year Specified Bovine Offal was to be removed in abattoirs. In 1996 animals \nover 30 months were prevented from entering the human food chain, and beef on the \nbone was banned from 1997 to 2000. A system of cattle traceability was devised. These \n 9\npolicies were largely successful and the disease has now been all but eliminated from the \nBritish beef industry.  \nAt the time of writing (August 2007) there have been 165 cases of people with \nconfirmed vCJD in the UK so far, of whom 161 have died. Under an intense media glare, \nbeef consumption dropped across the EU. In the UK there was a 40 per cent reported \ndrop in the consumption of beef in the first month after the announcement in 1996. This \ncan be traced in daily scanning data from supermarkets (Smith et al., 1999). The reaction \nwas even greater in Germany in 2000 when BSE was found in 25 indigenous cattle, and \nthe fear spread to other European countries that had previously felt safe. And yet, \ncounter-intuitively, in Britain the long-term decline of beef consumption, which started in \nthe 1950s, has actually been reversed since 1996. This is due to consumers switching \nfrom joints to other beef products, and from the cheaper cuts to the more expensive, for \ninstance organic. Perversely there seems to be greater consumer confidence now that the \nworst excesses of the 1980s industry have been corrected. \n \nConclusion \n \nDietary constraints in the past have not only been a matter of income and supply-\nside constraints. Consumers have always reacted to information about quality, and \nespecially disease. We may reasonably speculate that behaviour was regionally and \nculturally specific, although much comparative research is needed to clarify the nature of \nthe responses. This paper has argued, on the basis of a number of discursive themes, that \nzoonotic infections have provoked a variety of reactions in British consumers. Most of \nthese were probably no different from the prevailing perceptions of risk that were current \nat any one time.  Only dread risks, such as BSE, have reached to more fundamental levels \nbeyond the bounds or normal rational behaviour but, even here, the immediate changes in \nconsumption have been below the horizon of secular changes due to income, lifestyle and \nother shifts. Yes, consumers have responded to health messages, but over periods of years \nrather than the weeks or months that an individual food scare may live in the media. This \nis in contradiction to the now voluminous literature about the risk society of the era of \nglobalization, which claims salmonella in eggs and BSE as icons of a whole new age of \n 10\nmanufactured risk. It seems that risk society theorists must look further back in time if \nthey are to test their claims about novelty of food scares. Right now those claims seem to \nbe shaky and certainly not grounded in convincing historical evidence. \n \n 11\nReferences \n \nAtkins, P.J.
