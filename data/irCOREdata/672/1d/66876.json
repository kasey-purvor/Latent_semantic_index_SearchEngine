J.  LOWE\nI\nIn distinguishing between the primary and secondary qualities of\nbodies in the Essay, Locke notoriously included number amongst the\nfirst:1\nThe Qualities then that are in Bodies rightly considered, are of\nThree Sorts. First, the Bulk, Figure, Number, Situation, and\nMotion, or Rest of their solid Parts ... These I call primary\nQualities. (II, VIII, 23) \nLater in the Essay, in the chapter entitled \u2018Of Number\u2019, he goes on\nto say:\nAmongst all the Ideas we have, as there is none suggested to the\nMind by more ways, so there is none more simple, than that of\nUnity, or One: ... every Thought of our Minds brings this Idea\nalong with it. ... For Number applies it self to Men, Angels,\nActions, Thoughts, every thing that either doth exist, or can be\nimagined. (II, XVI, 1) \nJust as well-known as Locke\u2019s view of number and unity is\nBerkeley\u2019s peremptory repudiation of that view, in his Principles of\nHuman Knowledge.2 There Berkeley asserts, concerning number:\nThat number is entirely the creature of the mind ... will be evi-\ndent to whoever considers, that the same thing bears a different\ndenomination of number, as the mind views it with different\nrespects. Thus, the same extension is one or three or thirty-six,\naccording as the mind considers it with reference to a yard, a foot,\nor an inch. ... We say one book, one page, one line; all these are\nequally units, though some contain several of the others. (Part 1,\n12) \nPhilosophy 78 2003 321\ndoi:10.1017\/S0031819103000329 \u00a92003 The Royal Institute of Philosophy\n1 See John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, P. H.\nNidditch (ed.) (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975), from which edition all\nquoted passages are taken.\n2 Quoted passages are taken from George Berkeley, Philosophical Works,\nM. R. Ayers (ed.) (London: Dent, 1975).\nAnd in the next paragraph he continues, concerning unity:\nUnity I know some will have to be a simple or uncompounded\nidea, accompanying all other ideas into the mind. That I have any\nsuch idea answering the word unity, I do not find; and if I had,\nmethinks I could not miss finding it; on the contrary it should be\nthe most familiar to my understanding, since it is said to accom-\npany all other ideas. (13)\nIn his earlier work, An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision,\nBerkeley expresses similar contempt for Locke\u2019s conceptions of\nnumber and unity, again making the point that \n[N]umber ... is entirely the creature of the mind ... According as\nthe mind variously combines its ideas the unit varies: and as the\nunit, so the number, which is only a collection of units,  doth also\nvary. We call a window one, a chimney one, and yet a house in\nwhich there are many windows and many chimneys hath an equal\nright to be called one, and many houses go to the making of one\ncity. (109)\nThis passage is quoted, with apparent approval, by Frege in The\nFoundations of Arithmetic\u2014although, of course, Frege should not\nbe taken to concur with Berkeley\u2019s suggestion that number is some-\nhow subjective, \u2018entirely a creature of the mind\u2019, in view of Frege\u2019s\nown vehement opposition to psychologism in the philosophy of\nlogic and mathematics.3 Frege\u2019s agreement with  Berkeley extends\nonly as far as the latter\u2019s rejection of the view that, as Frege puts it,\n\u2018Number is a property of external things\u2019 (p. 27). Frege\u2019s own view\nis that\n[T]he content of a statement of number is an assertion about a\nconcept. This is perhaps clearest with the number 0. If I say\n\u2018Venus has 0 moons\u2019, there simply does not exist any moon or\nagglomeration of moons for anything to be asserted of; but what\nhappens is that a property is assigned to the concept \u2018moon of\nVenus\u2019, namely that of including nothing under it. If I say \u2018the\nKing\u2019s carriage is drawn by four horses\u2019, then I assign the\nnumber four to the concept \u2018horse that draws the King\u2019s car-\nriage\u2019. (p. 59)\nFrege himself appeals, on several occasions, to the sort of consider-\nation that Berkeley adduces for rejecting Locke\u2019s view of number,\nE. J. Lowe\n322\n3 See Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, trans. J. L. Austin,\n2nd edn (Oxford: Blackwell, 1953), p. 33, from which edition all subse-\nquent quoted passages are taken.\nnamely that \nWhile looking at one and the same external phenomenon, I can\nsay with equal truth both \u2018It is a copse\u2019 and \u2018It is five trees\u2019, or\nboth \u2018Here are four companies\u2019 and \u2018Here are 500 men\u2019. (p. 59)\nHere is another passage in which he makes the same point:\nI am able to think of the Iliad either as one poem, or as 24 Books,\nor as some large Number of verses. (p. 28)\nAnd here is a third: \nThe Number 1, ... or 100 or any other Number, cannot be said to\nbelong to [a] pile of playing cards in its own right, but at most to\nbelong to it in view of the way in which we have chosen to regard\nit. (p. 29)\nIn this last case, the suggestion is that what is, from one point of\nview, one pack of cards is, from another point of view, 52 cards,\nwhile from yet another it is four suits, and so on. Even so, there is\nevery indication that Frege is ambivalent about endorsing Berkeley\nin quite these terms\u2014and not just on account of Berkeley\u2019s subjec-\ntivism concerning number. Rather, the problem is that it is not hard\nto discern a latent incoherence in this way of putting things. The\nincoherence is very near the surface in one of the passages from\nFrege quoted a moment ago, where he says that \u2018While looking at\none and the same external phenomenon, I can say with equal truth\n\u201cIt is a copse\u201d and \u201cIt is five trees\u201d\u2019. For how can Frege say that one\nand the same \u2018external phenomenon\u2019 is both one copse and five\ntrees? (Admittedly, the German text reads \u2018derselben \u00e4ussern\nErscheinung\u2019, so that Austin\u2019s translation might be criticized for\nhaving \u2018one and the same\u2019 instead of just \u2018the same\u2019: but the\ndifficulty is made only marginally less obvious by this amendment.)\nWhat is this \u2018it\u2019 that is somehow both a single copse and five\ndifferent trees? Frege is clearly aware of the difficulty, for in first\npresenting the example of the pack of cards he remarks: \n[I]f I place a pile of playing cards in [someone\u2019s] hands with the\nwords: Find the Number of these, this does not tell him whether\nI wish to know the number of cards, or of complete packs of\ncards, or even say of honour cards at skat. To have given him the\npile in his hands is not yet to have given him completely the\nobject he is to investigate; I must add some further word\u2014cards,\nor packs, or honours. (pp. 28\u20139)\nIdentity, Individuality, and Unity \n323\nClearly, Frege does not really want to say, on his own account, that\none and the same thing can literally be both one and more than one.\nThis is why he admits, later, that\nSeveral examples given earlier gave the false impression that dif-\nferent numbers may belong to the same thing. This is to be\nexplained by the fact that we were there taking objects to be what\nhas number. As soon as we restore possession to the rightful\nowner, the concept, numbers reveal themselves as no less mutu-\nally exclusive in their own sphere than colours are in theirs. (p.\n61)\nIt would seem, then, that Frege\u2019s use of the controversial examples\nis supposed to contribute towards a reductio ad absurdum of the view\nthat numbers are properties of objects. The idea seems to be that if\nwe suppose that numbers are properties of objects, then we shall\nhave to say that different numbers may, with equal legitimacy, be\nassigned to the same object or objects: that, for example, the same\nthing may be regarded as one pack of cards or as 52 cards. However,\nthe trouble is that, far from creating a difficulty for philosophers\nlike Locke, the argument, thus understood, rebounds against Frege\nhimself. Berkeley, it should be noted, used the contentious examples\nto try to show that number is not a \u2018primary quality\u2019 of objects,\nwhich they possess independently of the mind: it was no part of his\npurpose to argue that number is not in any sense a property of\nobjects. But Frege clearly recognizes the incoherence of saying that\nanything could be at once one thing and more than one thing and\nthat this incoherence does not go away simply by supposing that\nnumber is somehow mind-dependent, or a matter of how we \u2018view\u2019\nor \u2018regard\u2019 whatever it is to which we are assigning a number. If this\nis incoherent, however, then it cannot be something to which any\nphilosopher is committed simply in virtue of supposing that num-\nber is a property of objects or things, as opposed to Fregean con-\ncepts. Rather, the philosopher who takes the former view must\nclearly just insist that, for example, one pack of cards cannot be\nidentified with 52 different cards, even though it may, of course, con-\nsist of 52 different cards.\nFrege\u2019s own contribution to our understanding of identity state-\nments and his introduction of the notion of a criterion of identity,\nfar from making difficulties for Locke\u2019s view of number, actually\naid the adherent of that view to rebut the sort of objection that\nBerkeley advances. Cards and packs of cards are kinds of things that\nare governed by quite different identity criteria, with the conse-\nquence that it makes no sense to say that something could fall under\nE. J. Lowe\n324\nboth of the sortal concepts card and pack of cards.4 (\u2018Sortal\u2019 is, of\ncourse, a term of Locke\u2019s own coinage.) A fortiori, then, something\ncannot intelligibly be assigned the number one inasmuch as it is\nregarded as falling under the concept pack of cards and the number\n52 inasmuch as it is regarded as falling under the concept card. The\nupshot of all this is that Frege\u2019s frequent appeal to the sort of objec-\ntion to Locke\u2019s view of number that we find in Berkeley is entirely\nbroken-backed.\nII\nFrege has related remarks about the notion of unity which are\nequally unsatisfactory, although in this case we may also take issue\nwith what Locke himself says on the matter. Berkeley, as we saw\nearlier, expresses contempt for Locke\u2019s suggestion that the idea of\nunity accompanies every other idea, saying that he can find no such\nidea in his own mind. Part of what Locke is suggesting, clearly, is\nthat everything whatever that exists or could exist is \u2018one\u2019 or a \u2018unit\u2019:\nthat simply in virtue of being self-identical and distinct from any-\nthing else, everything has \u2018unity\u2019. But Frege is just as contemptuous\nas Berkeley about this suggestion. Sarcastically, he comments:\nIt must strike us immediately as remarkable that every single\nthing should possess this property [of being \u2018one\u2019] ... It is only in\nvirtue of the possibility of something not being wise that it makes\nsense to say \u2018Solon is wise\u2019. The content of a concept diminishes\nas its extension increases; if its extension becomes all-embracing,\nits content must vanish altogether. It is not easy to imagine how\nlanguage could have come to invent a word for a property which\ncould not be of the slightest use for adding to the description of\nany object whatsoever. (p. 40)\nThis argument, too, backfires on Frege. In fact, in Austin\u2019s transla-\ntion, the first sentence in the passage just quoted looks manifestly\nabsurd: \u2018It must strike us immediately as remarkable that every sin-\ngle thing should possess this property [of being \u201cone\u201d]\u2019\u2014for what\nis a \u2018single\u2019 thing if not, precisely, one thing? Singularity and uni-\ntariness are, if not identical concepts, at least intimately related.\nAnd is the concept of singularity somehow left devoid of content if\nIdentity, Individuality, and Unity \n325\n4 I defend this thesis quite generally in my Kinds of Being: A Study of\nIndividuation, Identity and the Logic of Sortal Terms (Oxford: Blackwell,\n1989), ch. 4.\nwe suppose that everything exhibits singularity? I ask this question\nwithout presuming that such a supposition is correct, for in point of\nfact I think that the supposition can certainly be challenged, for rea-\nsons that I shall give later. My point here is merely that one could\nnot legitimately convict a philosopher of incoherence or vacuity for\ncontending that everything that there is is singular in character.\nHowever, it would be unfair to press this objection to Frege simply\non the strength of Austin\u2019s translation, for the translation is mis-\nleading at this point. Frege\u2019s original words do not contain anything\ntranslatable as \u2018single\u2019 or \u2018singular\u2019. The sentence in question reads,\nin German, simply as follows: \u2018Auffallend w\u00e4re zun\u00e4chst, dass jedes\nDing diese Eigenschaft h\u00e4tte\u2019. Nonetheless, the general point still\nstands, that it is a poor argument against a putative concept that\nthose who profess to deploy it suppose it to apply to everything\nwhatever. Most philosophers (and, clearly, even Frege himself)\nwould accept that the concept of self-identity applies to everything\nwhatever, but they cannot be convicted on that account of evacuat-\ning the concept of all content.\nFrege supplements the poor argument that I have just criticized\nby urging that \u2018Solon was one\u2019 does not make sense in anything like\nthe way that \u2018Solon was wise\u2019 does, because the former is not \u2018intel-\nligible on its own in isolation\u2019 (p. 40). He goes on:\nThis is even clearer if we take the plural. Whereas we can com-\nbine \u2018Solon was wise\u2019 and \u2018Thales was wise\u2019 into \u2018Solon and\nThales were wise\u2019, we cannot say \u2018Solon and Thales were one\u2019.\nBut it is hard to see why this should be impossible, if \u2018one\u2019 were\na property both of Solon and of Thales in the same way that\n\u2018wise\u2019 is. (pp. 40\u20131)\nHowever, the natural and correct response to this is to point out that\nbeing one is necessarily a property only of single things, whereas\nSolon and Thales are not a single thing: rather, they are two things,\nwhence they possess the property of being two. (This will become\nclearer shortly, when we come to discuss pluralities.) It remains the\ncase that we can still say, quite truly, \u2018Solon and Thales were each\none\u2019, while also saying, with equal truth, \u2018Solon and Thales\n(together) were two\u2019. The fact that Solon and Thales were two, even\nthough Solon was not two and Thales was not two, is no more\npuzzling than the fact, say, that Smith and Jones moved the piano,\neven though Smith did not move the piano and Jones did not move\nthe piano (the piano being too heavy for one person to move). Any\noddity that attaches to sentences like \u2018Solon was one\u2019 and \u2018Solon and\nThales were two\u2019 is, I suggest, purely pragmatic in character,\nE. J. Lowe\n326\narising from the fact that the applicability of the predicate is already\napparent from the grammatical form of the subject, so that such\nsentences appear to be stating the obvious. However, what is\nobvious is not precluded from being both meaningful and true.   \nEven so, the suggestion that everything has the property of being\none\u2014that everything is one thing\u2014might be questioned on the\nground that the numbers, including the number one, are used in\ncounting things, but that it makes no sense to count things as such,\nsince we can only count things of specifiable sorts or kinds. This,\nindeed, was the implication of Frege\u2019s remarks, quoted earlier, con-\ncerning the pile of cards, and the indeterminacy of the instruction\nto \u2018Find the Number of these\u2019. One needs to be told whether one is\nto count the packs, or the cards, or the honour cards, or whatnot.\nHowever, while there is something that is right about what Frege\nsays in this connection, there is also something that is wrong or at\nleast misleading. It is wrong, and obviously so, to suppose that one\ncannot include things of many different kinds in a single count. I\ncould quite coherently ask someone to count the packs and the\ncards, for instance. If there were 52 cards and four complete suits,\nthen the answer to the question \u2018What is the number of packs and\ncards?\u2019 would be 53. This would be an odd question to ask, but not\nan unintelligible or unanswerable one. Similarly, it would make per-\nfectly good sense to ask how many children and books there were in\na certain classroom. On the other hand, it is not so easy to make\nsense of an instruction, say, to count the cards and the honour cards,\nsimply because each honour card is a card and we presumably ought\nto avoid double-counting. Even so, given a suitable disambiguation\nof this instruction, it too could be coherently carried out. Indeed,\non the most reasonable interpretation of it, the answer would seem\nto be, in the case envisaged, 52\u2014in other words, that there are just\nas many cards and honour cards as there are cards.5\nWhere problems of principle arise in matters of counting is\nwhere we are expected, somehow, to include in the count items that\ndo not qualify as single things. For many philosophers\u2014including, it\nwould appear, Locke\u2014no such problem can ever arise, precisely\nbecause, in their view, everything whatever that exists or could exist\nis a single thing. However, as I have already indicated, this view can\ncertainly be challenged. And, of course, anyone who does challenge\nIdentity, Individuality, and Unity \n327\n5 For a recent repudiation of the thesis that it is somehow incoherent to\ninquire, without qualification, into \u2018the number of things\u2019, see Peter van\nInwagen, \u2018The Number of Things\u2019, Philosophical Issues 12 (2002), pp.\n176\u201396.\nit will not be vulnerable to Frege\u2019s objection, for what it is worth,\nthat it is vacuous to attribute \u2018oneness\u2019 to objects because this is a\nproperty that everything would have to have.\nBut, it will now be asked, how can it make sense to say that some-\nthing might fail to be one, singular, or unitary\u2014fail to possess one-\nness, singularity, or unitariness? If the question were how some\nthing could fail to be one, singular, or unitary, then I might indeed\nbe inclined to dismiss as incoherent the thought that there could be\nany such failure, because the concept of a \u2018thing\u2019 seems already to\nhave the notion of singularity or unitariness built into it. However,\nwhile \u2018Everything is something\u2019 is, apparently, a trivial truth of\nlogic, \u2018Everything is some thing\u2019 looks like a more substantive meta-\nphysical claim. \nOne reason for denying that everything is a thing is that the\nworld, as well as containing individual things, contains pluralities of\nthings\u2014and a plurality of things is not a single thing. Indeed, if we\nare to take seriously Locke\u2019s suggestion that number is a property of\nthings, then, clearly, the only number that can be assigned to a sin-\ngle thing\u2014Berkeley\u2019s objection having been repudiated\u2014is one.\nAnd this means, of course, that numbers other than one can only be\nassigned to more than one thing\u2014that is, to pluralities of things. We\nsay, for example, and quite properly, that the planets are nine in\nnumber, as are the muses. In the sentence \u2018The planets are nine\u2019, the\nsubject term, \u2018the planets\u2019, refers plurally to Mercury, Venus, Mars,\nEarth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, and the predi-\ncate attributes the property of being nine to that plurality. We\nshould not be misled here by the fact that the expression \u2018that plu-\nrality\u2019 is grammatically singular in form. This is a mere idiosyn-\ncrasy of idiom and does not signify that there is some further thing,\n\u2018the plurality of the planets\u2019, in addition to the planets themselves.\nWhen I suggest that pluralities provide a plausible exception to the\nthesis that \u2018Everything is a thing\u2019, I mean just this: pluralities exist,\nand yet, manifestly, are not single things. For instance, the planets\nexist, and yet are not one thing. To the extent, then, that the so-\ncalled universal quantifier, expressed in English by means of the\nword \u2018everything\u2019, ranges at least over what exists, it ranges over\npluralities as well as over single things, given that pluralities exist.\nHence it is true to say that not everything is a thing.\nBut this is not the only reason for denying that everything is a\nthing. Pluralities of individual things can at least be assigned a\nnumber. The planets are nine and the books of the Iliad are 24. To\navoid potential confusion, let us henceforth use the term \u2018entity\u2019 to\ndenote anything whatever that does or could exist, whether or not it\nE. J. Lowe\n328\nis an individual thing. Then, I want to say, there are or could be\nentities to which numbers cannot even in principle be assigned. One\nof the most plausible supporting examples for this thesis is provid-\ned by quantities of matter, especially if these are conceived as homo-\ngeneous and infinitely divisible. Such a quantity of matter might\nseem to be a good candidate for being a plurality\u2014but it cannot, it\nseems, be a plurality of individual things. This is because, although\nit includes distinct entities, each of the entities that it includes is in\nturn a (lesser) quantity of matter. If all quantities of matter were\nultimately made up of indivisible atoms\u2014which may be something\nlike the truth as far as the actual physical world is concerned\u2014then\nthey would indeed be very good candidates for being pluralities,\nnamely, pluralities of atoms. (Locke himself was sympathetic to\natomism, of course.) But it doesn\u2019t really make sense, it would\nseem, to talk of a plurality which is not a plurality of individual\nthings, since the concept of a plurality is tied to that of number and\nwhere there are no individual things no number can meaningfully\nbe assigned. \nWe need, it would seem, a new ontological term to apply to enti-\nties such as our hypothetical quantities of homogeneous and infi-\nnitely divisible matter. We could call them, perhaps, dividuals.6\nDividuals cannot be assigned numbers\u2014neither the number one\nnor any greater number. They are not single things, nor are they\npluralities. Yet dividuals may be distinguished: the quantity of mat-\nter in one bowl may be wholly distinct from the quantity of matter\nin another bowl. Any proper part of a quantity of matter is a quan-\ntity of matter which is distinct from the whole of which it is a part\nand distinct, too, from other proper parts of that same whole. To\navoid any misunderstanding here, it must be emphasized that a\nquantity of matter is not the same as a piece of matter. A piece of\nmatter is an individual thing, composed of matter that is gathered\ntogether to make a single connected whole. That same quantity of\nmatter could be divided and separated in infinitely many different\nways, without thereby ceasing to exist. It would continue to exist\neven if it were scattered across the entire universe. A piece of mat-\nter, on the other hand, continues to exist only so long as the quanti-\nty of matter composing it remains gathered together.\nIdentity, Individuality, and Unity \n329\n6 I am not sure whether this term has been used by anyone else before\nme, but I first used it myself in my \u2018Primitive Substances\u2019, Philosophy and\nPhenomenological Research 54 (1994), pp. 531\u201352. See also my The\nPossibility of Metaphysics: Substance, Identity, and Time (Oxford:\nClarendon Press, 1998), p. 161.\nI have just said that numbers\u2014and here I mean cardinal num-\nbers, quite generally\u2014cannot be assigned to dividuals. But there is,\nof course, a perfectly good sense in which numbers can be assigned\nto dividuals, such as quantities of matter. For we can say, concern-\ning a certain quantity of matter, how much of it there is and assign a\nnumber to this amount, given an appropriate choice of units for the\npurposes of measurement. (Here we may in principle need recourse\nnot just to integral or rational numbers but to real numbers, given\nthe hypothesized infinite divisibility of quantities of matter.) So, for\nexample, if we use kilogrammes as our units of mass, we may say\nthat there are 2\u00b735 kilogrammes of matter in the bowl. However, it\nis important to appreciate that in thus assigning a number to the\nquantity of matter in the bowl, we are focusing on just one physical\nproperty of the matter, its mass. After all, we might alternatively\nwant to assign a number to the volume of the quantity of matter\nrather than to its mass. So, what we are measuring and thus assign-\ning numbers to is not really the mere quantity of matter as such but,\nrather, certain of its properties, such as its mass or its volume. It\nwould seem that there are and can be no \u2018units\u2019 for measuring how\nmuch matter, as such, a quantity of matter is. And, in any case, it is\nclear that the sense in which we can assign numbers to quantities of\nmatter is completely distinct from that in which we can assign num-\nbers to pluralities of individual things and in no way undermines\nthe ontological distinction that I just have proposed between indi-\nviduals and dividuals.    \nIII\nSo far, I have mainly been concerned to defend the Lockean view\nthat number is a property of objects against Frege\u2019s view that num-\nber is a property of concepts. (Of course, in this connection it is\nimportant to appreciate that Frege thinks of concepts as being\nobjective and mind-independent, and hence as being quite distinct\nfrom the psychological entities that Locke and Berkeley call \u2018ideas\u2019.)\nEven the most ardent supporter of Frege must surely concede that\nFrege\u2019s view on this matter is relatively counter-intuitive\u2014and,\nafter all, he himself implicitly pays tribute to the intuitiveness of\nthe Lockean view in spending so much effort to convince us of its\nfalsehood. One consideration which, as a passage quoted earlier\nindicates, seems to have weighed heavily with Frege is the apparent\nproblem confronted by the Lockean view in the case of the number\n0. As Frege remarks, \u2018If I say \u201cVenus has 0 moons\u201d, there simply\nE. J. Lowe\n330\ndoes not exist any moon or agglomeration of moons for anything to\nbe asserted of\u2019. In other words, even if we can maintain that the\nproperty of being one is a property that an object can (and indeed\nmust) possess and that numbers greater than one can be possessed\nby pluralities of objects, it seems that there plainly can\u2019t be any\nobject that possesses the property of being zero. By contrast, the\nconcept moon of Venus clearly can have assigned to it the property\nof \u2018including nothing under it\u2019, which is how Frege recommends us\nto think of something\u2019s having the number 0. Moreover, this way of\nthinking of the bearers of numerical properties famously enables\nhim to forge a link between distinctions of number and quantifica-\ntional distinctions, as expressed by words like \u2018all\u2019, \u2018some\u2019, and\n\u2018none\u2019. This in turn enables him to observe that\n[E]xistence is analogous to number. Affirmation of existence is in\nfact nothing but denial of the number nought. Because existence\nis a property of concepts the ontological argument for the exis-\ntence of God breaks down. (p. 65)\nHow can an adherent of Locke\u2019s view of number respond to these\npoints? Well, first of all, it may be pointed out that, although it\ncomes very naturally to a mathematician to think of \u2018zero\u2019 as denot-\ning a number, most ordinary folk would consider it at best a bad\njoke to be told that, say, there is a number of pound notes in a sealed\nenvelope that has just been given to them, when in fact the envelope\nis empty. The response \u2018Well, I did say a number of pound notes,\nand nought is a number\u2019 would do nothing to pacify the irate recip-\nient. The introduction of the zero symbol was undoubtedly an\nimportant landmark in the history of mathematics, but we should\nnot assume that its utility in calculation is dependent upon its actu-\nally denoting some object or expressing some property. In particu-\nlar, we should not uncritically accept the currently standard view\nthat \u2018zero\u2019 denotes the empty set, because it is far from clear that the\nnotion of such a set really makes sense. All that we are ever\ninformed about the empty set is that it is (1) a set, (2) has no mem-\nbers, and (3) is unique amongst sets in having no members.\nHowever, there are very many things that \u2018have no members\u2019, in the\nset-theoretical sense\u2014namely, all non-sets. It is perfectly clear why\nthese things have no members, for they are not sets. What is unclear\nis how there can be, uniquely amongst sets, a set which has no\nmembers. We cannot conjure such an entity into existence by mere\nstipulation\u2014although this is, in effect, what Frege himself does\nwith respect to the number nought.\nFrege defines the number nought as follows:\nIdentity, Individuality, and Unity \n331\nSince nothing falls under the concept \u2018not identical with itself\u2019, I\ndefine nought as follows: 0 is the Number which belongs to the\nconcept \u2018not identical with itself\u2019. (p. 87)\nBut what entitles him to suppose that anything exists which satisfies\nthis definition? Here he can appeal to another definition, namely, his\ngeneral definition of Number:\n[T]he Number which belongs to the concept F is the extension of\nthe concept \u2018equal to the concept F\u2019 (pp. 79\u201380),\nwhere, as he has already explained, a concept F is \u2018equal\u2019 to a con-\ncept G just in case it is possible to \u2018correlat[e] one to one the objects\nwhich fall under the one concept with those which fall under the\nother\u2019 (p. 79). From this and the previous definition it follows that\n0 is the extension of the concept \u2018equal to the concept \u201cnot identi-\ncal with itself\u201d\u2019. But what entitles Frege to suppose that the \u2018exten-\nsion\u2019 of this concept exists? Well, the notorious Axiom V of Frege\u2019s\nGrundgesetze der Arithmetik will give him what he needs, since that\naxiom says, in effect, that the extension of the concept F is identi-\ncal with the extension of the concept G if and only if all and only\nthe objects which fall under F also fall under G\u2014and this in turn\nimplies that every concept has an extension. But that, of course, is\nwhat brings about the downfall of Axiom V, because it thereby falls\nvictim to Russell\u2019s paradox.7\nHowever, the so-called \u2018neo-logicists\u2019 think that Frege has the\nresources with which to proceed in another and more satisfactory\nway, by appealing not to Axiom V but to his own criterion of iden-\ntity for cardinal numbers\u2014a criterion which now often goes by the\nname of \u2018Hume\u2019s principle\u2019 and is expressible in the form \u2018The\nnumber which belongs to the concept F is identical with the num-\nber which belongs to the concept G if and only if it is possible to\ncorrelate one to one the objects which fall under the concept F with\nthose which fall under the concept G\u2019. Then he can \u2018prove\u2019 the exis-\ntence of the number nought by taking both \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 in Hume\u2019s\nprinciple to stand for \u2018not identical with itself\u2019, to give us as a sup-\nposedly true equivalence \u2018The number which belongs to the con-\ncept \u201cnot identical with itself\u201d is identical with the number which\nbelongs to the concept \u201cnot identical with itself\u201d if and only if there\nare exactly as many non-self-identical things as there are non-self-\nidentical things\u2019. Since what stands on the righthand side of this\nequivalence is an analytic and indeed logical truth, what stands on\nE. J. Lowe\n332\n7 See, e.g., Crispin Wright, Frege\u2019s Conception of Numbers as Objects\n(Aberdeen: Aberdeen University Press, 1983), p. 155.\nthe left is true, given that the equivalence itself is true. But what\nstands on the left entails \u2018There is something that is identical with\nthe number which belongs to the concept \u201cnot identical with\nitself\u201d\u2019. However, since Frege has just defined nought as the num-\nber which belongs to the concept \u2018not identical with itself\u2019, it fol-\nlows from this that there is something that is the number nought\u2014\nin other words, that the number nought exists.8 What is remarkable\nis that Frege imagined that he could, one way or another, pull this\nparticular rabbit out of the hat so shortly after having criticized\nadherents of the ontological argument for doing something very\nsimilar in the case of God.\nThe proper response to all of this, it seems to me, is to deny\nHume\u2019s principle, at least in its Fregean formulation. I am happy to\naccept an alternative formulation, to the effect that pluralities whose\nmembers are one-one correlatable are equinumerous, or possess the\nsame number. Taking a single object to be the limiting or degener-\nate case of a plurality, this allows us to say that every single object\npossesses the number one. But since the notion of a \u2018null\u2019 plurality\nis a manifest absurdity, we are not committed to existence of \u2018the\nnumber nought\u2019. A particularly objectionable feature of Hume\u2019s\nprinciple in its Fregean formulation, from an ontological point of\nview, is that it entails (in conjunction with a definition of \u2018succes-\nsor\u2019) not only the existence of the number nought, as defined by\nFrege, but the existence of infinitely many cardinal numbers, name-\nly, all the successors of the number nought. Some philosophers\nclearly think that this is, on the contrary, a great virtue of Frege\u2019s\nversion of Hume\u2019s principle, since it gives them mathematical\nobjects on the cheap. But in serious ontology there is no such thing\nas a free lunch. (Of course, it should also be remarked that invoking\nthe name of Hume in this connection is highly misleading, in any\ncase, since Hume himself did not appear to have anything like\nFrege\u2019s criterion of identity for cardinal numbers in mind when he\nwrote the passage cited by Frege, namely, that \u2018When two numbers\nare so combined as that the one has always an unit answering to\nevery unit of the other, we pronounce them equal\u2019 (p. 73).9 Hume\nseems to have in mind, rather, a method for determining, for arbi-\ntrarily chosen natural numbers n, n\u2019, m, and m\u2019, whether or not (n +\nn\u2019) = (m + m\u2019), e.g., whether or not (7 + 5) = (9 + 3).)\nIdentity, Individuality, and Unity \n333\n8 Precisely this proof may be found in Wright, Frege\u2019s Conception of\nNumbers as Objects, pp. 158\u20139.\n9 See David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, ed. L. A. Selby-Bigge\nand P. H. Nidditch (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1978), Bk I, Part III, sect.\n1 [p. 71].\nBut what are we to say about the linkage, forged by Frege,\nbetween numerical notions and the notions of quantification and\nexistence? In particular, if we reject his view of number, should we\nalso reject his view of the meaning of existential statements?\nAccording to Frege, existence is a \u2018second-level\u2019 concept. Thus, in\n\u2018On Concept and Object\u2019 he remarks:10\nI have called existence a property of a concept. How I mean this\nto be taken is best made clear by an example. In the sentence\n\u2018there is at least one square root of 4\u2019, we have an assertion ...\nabout a concept, square root of 4; viz. that it is not empty. (pp.\n48\u20139)\nAnd a little later:\nI do not want to say it is false to assert about an object what is\nasserted here about a concept; I want to say it is impossible,\nsenseless, to do so. The sentence \u2018there is Julius Caesar\u2019 is neither\ntrue nor false but senseless. (p. 50)\nHowever, \u2018Julius Caesar exists\u2019 seems to make perfectly good sense\nand is most improbably analysed as meaning anything like, say,\n\u2018There is at least one thing that is identical with Julius Caesar\u2019, even\nif it entails the latter. That is to say, it is most implausible to suggest\nthat in affirming Julius Caesar\u2019s existence we mean to affirm, about\nthe concept identical with Julius Caesar, that it is \u2018not empty\u2019. In any\ncase, in what does the \u2018non-emptiness\u2019 of such a concept consist?\nSurely, simply in the being of something which \u2018falls under it\u2019. But\nall that can \u2018fall under it\u2019 is an object\u2014in this case, Julius Caesar. So\nthe non-emptiness of this particular concept can only consist in the\nbeing\u2014the existence\u2014of Julius Caesar. More generally, far from its\nbeing the case that existence is to be explained in terms of the \u2018non-\nemptiness\u2019 of concepts, quite the reverse seems most plausible\u2014\nthat the \u2018non-emptiness\u2019 of concepts, which is a technical rather\nthan a common-sense notion, calls out for explanation in terms of\nthe existence of objects falling under them. The proper conclusion\nto draw is that existence, like number, is a property of objects. The\nfact that these properties are very unlike commonplace empirical\nproperties, such as the physical properties of colour and shape, is\nneither here nor there. The same is true of such \u2018formal\u2019 properties\nas the property of being self-identical, the property of being an\nobject and, indeed, the property of being a property. \nE. J. Lowe\n334\n10 See Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege, 2nd\nedn, P. Geach and M. Black (eds.) (Oxford: Blackwell, 1960).\nIV\nWhere now does this leave us with regard to the key ontological\nnotions of identity, individuality and unity mentioned in the title of\nthis paper? The general position that I wish to recommend may be\nsummarized as follows. Not every entity that does or could exist is\nan individual object of some kind, although every entity is neces-\nsarily self-identical. An individual object is an entity which, quite\nliterally, counts as one entity of some kind, in order to do which it\nmust possess unity. Only unitary entities can qualify as individual or\nsingle objects, capable in principle of being enumerated along with\nother such objects. There are or could be entities which lack unity,\nwhich we might call dividuals, as opposed to individuals. Putative\nexamples of such entities are quantities of homogeneous and infi-\nnitely divisible matter. This distinction between dividuals and indi-\nviduals is reflected in ordinary language in the distinction between\nmass nouns and count nouns or, in an alternative terminology,\nbetween mass terms and sortal terms. \nBoth dividuals and individuals may have parts, but the parts of\ndividuals are further dividuals and need not be unified in any way.\nIn contrast, a composite individual\u2014one that has proper parts\u2014\nmust have parts that are integrated according to some principle that\nis characteristic of individuals of its kind. For example, an animal,\nsuch as a tiger, is a composite individual of such a kind that it must\nhave organic parts that are spatially and causally connected so as to\nenable them to function in the right sort of way to sustain the life of\nthe individual animal that they compose. Typically, the parts of a\ncomposite individual of a given kind are individuals of various\nother kinds\u2014as, for example, the parts of a tiger include such things\nas its heart, eyes, stomach, legs, and so forth.\nOnly individuals are countable. Each individual counts as one\u2014\nthat is, as one thing of its kind. No individual can count as more\nthan one. Only pluralities of individuals can count as more than\none. Although a composite individual, such as an individual pack of\ncards, may have many parts, the composite individual itself can still\nonly count as one. What counts as more than one in such a case is\nnot the composite individual but a plurality of its parts. Since the\nparts of a composite individual may themselves have parts, which\nare also parts of the composite individual in question (since part-\nhood is transitive), there may be many different pluralities of parts\nthat may be said to compose the same individual. Thus, for exam-\nple, an individual tiger is composed by its various organs and limbs,\nbut is also composed by a plurality of atomic and sub-atomic\nIdentity, Individuality, and Unity \n335\nparticles. The different pluralities composing the same composite\nindividual may very well have different numbers assignable to\nthem. But, once more, the composite individual itself may only be\nassigned the number one.  \nIt is possible, at least in principle, for an individual to be com-\nposed of dividuals\u2014as, for example, a piece of homogeneous and\ninfinitely divisible matter would be composed by quantities of\nhomogeneous and infinitely divisible matter. Dividuals, such as\nquantities of homogeneous and infinitely divisible matter, possess\nself-identity and are determinately distinct from one another and\nfrom all individuals. And yet, as we have seen, they lack unity and\nconsequently are uncountable\u2014not in the sense that they are\nuncountably many, like the real numbers, but rather in the sense\nthat cardinal numbers are not assignable to them. They cannot\ncomprise pluralities in the way that individuals do. Locke was right\nto say that number is a property of objects. But he was wrong to\nassert that \u2018Number applies it self to Men, Angels, Actions,\nThoughts, every thing that either doth exist, or can be imagined\u2019\n(II, XVI, 1). For number does not apply to dividuals and yet divid-\nuals can at least be imagined.11\nUniversity of Durham\nE. J.
