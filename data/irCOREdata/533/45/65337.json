Functional imaging demonstrated\nthat like our control observers, D.F. shows significantly more activation when passively\nviewing face compared to scene images in an area that is consistent with the fusiform\nface area (FFA) (p < 0.01). Control observers also show occipital face area (OFA)\nactivation; however, whereas D.F.'s lesions appear to overlap the OFA bilaterally. We\nasked, given that D.F. shows FFA activation for faces, to what extent is she able to\nrecognize faces? D.F. demonstrated a severe impairment in higher-level face\nprocessing\u2014 she could not recognize face identity, gender or emotional expression. In\ncontrast, she performed relatively normally on many face-categorization tasks. D.F. can\ndifferentiate faces from non-faces given sufficient texture information and processing\ntime, and she can do this is independent of color and illumination information. D.F. can\nuse configural information for categorizing faces when they are presented in an upright\nbut not a sideways orientation and given that she also cannot discriminate half-faces she\nmay rely on a spatially symmetric feature arrangement. Faces appear to be a unique\ncategory, which she can classify even when she has no advance knowledge that she will\nbe shown face images. Together, these imaging and behavioral data support the\nimportance of the integrity of a complex network of regions for face identification,\nincluding more than just the FFA\u2014in particular the OFA, a region believed to be\nassociated with low-level processing.\nKeywords: fMRI, FFA, OFA, face recognition, prosopagnosia\nTotal words: 6894\n3Prosopagnosia is a neurological deficit characterized by an inability to recognize\nfaces despite intact intellectual and cognitive function and spared early visual processing.\nCases have been reported where this dissociation occurs with little or no impairment in\nvisual recognition of other types of stimuli (e.g.Duchaine & Nakayama, in press; McNeil\n& Warrington, 1993; Nunn, Postma & Pearson, 2001; Whiteley & Warrington, 1977).\nComplementary cases have shown that the converse dissociation, normal face recognition\nwith severe object agnosia, is also possible (Humphreys & Rumiati, 1998; McMullen,\nFisk & Phillips, 2000; Moscovitch, Winocur & Behrmann,1997) Prosopagnosia,\nhowever, may also occur in combination with other visual recognition deficits such as an\ninability to recognize objects and\/or words (e.g. Damasio, Damasio, & Van Hoesen,\n1982) or landmarks (e.g. Pallis, 1955). The nature of lesions associated with\nprosopagnosia has long been documented and anatomical and imaging data (CT, MRI,\nSPECT) from patients with prosopagnosia converge on bilateral inferior occipitotemporal\ncortical damage (see Farah, 1990 for a summary). This suggests that a relatively localized\ncortical area is involved in the inability to perceive faces. Whether prosopagnosia occurs\nin isolation or is accompanied by other agnosias presumably depends on the extent of the\ncortical damage.\nParalleling neuropsychological evidence, functional imaging in neurologically-\nintact individuals shows discrete cortical areas that are significantly more active when\npassively viewing faces than other non-face stimuli such as objects (Kanwisher,\nMcDermott & Chun 1997), letter strings (Puce et al., 1996) or houses (Tonget al., 2000).\nThis area within the fusiform gyrus has been termed the fusiform face area, or FFA\n4(Kanwisher, McDermott & Chun, 1997). FFA activation correlates well with successful\nface processing but not with successful object processing (Grill-Spector, Knouf, &\nKanwisher, 2004).  Similarly, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown\nother cortical areas to be selectively more active when viewing other classes of stimuli.\nThis includes objects\u2014the lateral occipital complex (LOC\u2014an area comprising the\nlateral surface near the lateral occipital sulcus (LO), the ventral occipito-temporal\nregions (LOa\/pFs) extending into the posterior and mid fusiform gyrus and\noccipito-temporal sulcus) (Malach et al., 1995, Grill-Spector, Kourtzi & Kanwisher,\n2001), scenes or places\u2014the parahippocampal place area (PPA) (Epstein & Kanwisher,\n1998), letter strings\u2014the left occipitotemporal and inferior occipital sulci (Puce et al.,\n1996), and the human body\u2014 a region in the right lateral occipitotemporal cortex\n(extrastriate body area or EBA) (Downing et al., 2001). Early studies of face-selective\nactivation in the cortex saw that, in addition to the FFA, other cortical areas were\nselectively active for faces, specifically in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and in the\ninferior and mid occipital gyri (e.g. Halgren et al., 1999; Haxby et al., 1999; Kanwisher,\nMcDermott & Chun, 1997; Vaina et al., 2002) although in some studies these areas\nappeared to be less systematically activated (e.g. Kanwisher et al., 1997) or showed a\nweaker face-selective response (Gauthier et al., 2000) than the FFA. The importance of\nthe inferior occipital area in face processing has been, until recently, somewhat\noverlooked for these reasons and also because it is a relatively \"early\" visual area in the\nventral stream\u2014earlier areas are assumed to perform lower-level processing rather than\nhigher-level processing such as face recognition. Gauthier et al. (2000) termed the face-\nselective inferior occipital area that falls within the larger LOC region, the occipital face\narea (OFA).\n5Consistent with the notion of discrete brain areas for processing such image\nclasses as faces, objects and scenes, behavioral evidence in neurologically-intact\nparticipants suggests that qualitatively different cognitive processes are involved. For\nexample, the attentional demands of scene and object processing appear to be different\n(Li et al., 2002). Other behavioral measures show face-specific effects of visual\nprocessing that do not affect other image categories. For instance, rotating a face image\nupside-down disturbs face recognition ability more than object recognition (Yin, 1969).\nIn contrast, the ability to classify a scene image correctly is not significantly affected by\ninverting it (Steeves et al., 2004). Further, face recognition appears to involve more\nholistic processing than object recognition, which can often operate using more part-\nbased mechanisms. For example, individual parts of a face are more accurately\nrecognized when presented within the whole face rather than in isolation. This is not the\ncase for other types of stimuli such as scrambled faces, inverted faces or houses (Tanaka\n& Farah, 1993).\nIt seems intuitive to expect then that damage to these brain areas would result in\ndomain specific agnosias. To a certain degree, this does appear to be the case.\nTopographical agnosia patients, who have damage localized to the region of the PPA, are\nimpaired in scene recognition but not object recognition and do not show functional\nactivation for scene images in this brain region (Epstein et al., 2001). Consistent with this\nnotion our research group recently performed MRI and fMRI scans on a patient, D.F.\nwho suffers from profound visual form agnosia (a deficit in object recognition based on\nform). It was revealed that her area of damage overlaps with the object-selective lateral-\noccipital area (LO) of the LOC in normal participants in both hemispheres (James et al.,\n62003). We also recently examined functional activation for scenes in patient D.F. and\nobserved that despite an absence of object recognition she had relatively normal scene\nrecognition ability and PPA activation (Steeves, et al., 2004). In that paper, we also\nobserved that D.F. showed what appeared to be normal functional activation for faces in\nan area consistent with the FFA. However, it has been informally noted that patient D.F.\nhas an inability to recognize faces. If she can not recognize objects and has no LO but can\nrecognize scenes and has an intact PPA, why can she not recognize faces when she shows\nfunctional activation in the FFA? Here, we extensively examine her inability to recognize\nfaces given that she demonstrates FFA activation for faces and find that D.F. has spared\nface categorization but no higher-level face processing abilities. We speculate that since\nher bilateral LO lesions overlap with the OFA bilaterally, an intact network between the\nFFA and the OFA may be necessary to drive higher-level face processing.\n7Methods\nPatient History:\nD.F. is a female patient, age 47 years, who suffered brain damage as a result of\naccidental carbon monoxide poisoning at age 34. D.F. shows relatively normal perimetry\nfor static targets in the central visual field up to 30\u00baeccentricity but with some lower\nvisual field loss. Details of extensive neuropsychological and sensory testing of D.F. are\ndescribed in Milner et al. (1991). She has profound visual form agnosia (a deficit in\nobject recognition based on form) which has also been detailed elsewhere (Milner et al.,\n1991). D.F. has great difficulty perceiving the shape, size and orientation of objects, as\nwell as in recognizing or copying line drawings of objects (Servos et al., 1993). She can\ndiscriminate, however, amongst hues and name colors appropriately (Milner & Heywood,\n1989). As a result, D.F. can recognize real objects, particularly natural objects such as\nfruit and vegetables, based on surface information such as color and visual texture\n(Humphrey et al., 1994). It has been noted that D.F. is unable to recognize the faces of\npeople familiar to her during previous neuropsychological examination (Milner et al.\n1991) although this prosopagnosia has not been extensively quantified to date. Patient\nD.F. behaves like a prosopagnosic in that she recognizes people that are familiar to her on\nthe basis of non-face cues such as clothing, hair, stature, gait, and voice, for example. In\naddition, D.F. does not respond to facial expression in her interaction with others.\nRecent brain imaging data suggest that D.F.'s deficits in form vision are largely a\nconsequence of localized damage to occipito-temporal regions involved in object\nrecognition. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) carried out one year after the accident\n8revealed a distributed pattern of brain damage consistent with anoxia, but the damage was\nmost evident in the lateral occipital cortex and the medial occipitoparietal region (Milner\net al., 1991). Our research group had the opportunity to perform additional MRI and\nfMRI scans of D.F. in 2001 (Culham, 2004; James et al., 2003). An examination of the\nanatomical MRI images suggested three main lesions, one in the lateral occipital (LO)\ncortex of each hemisphere and one in the left hemisphere near the top of the parieto-\noccipital sulcus.  The location in stereotaxic space (Talairach & Tournoux, 1988) of\nD.F.\u2019s bilateral lateral occipital lesions overlap almost completely with fMRI activation\nof LO in normal observers viewing images of objects. In other words, D.F.\u2019s lesions are\nlocalized in the very regions of the occipitotemporal cortex that have been implicated in\nthe visual processing of objects (James et al., 2003). Although D.F.'s anatomical scans\nreveal a widening of the sulci throughout the cerebral cortex, fMRI showed normal\nactivation in visual cortex and dorsal stream regions that appear to subserve her preserved\nvisuomotor abilities such as grasping (Goodale & Milner, 1992). This clear dissociation\nbetween perception and action in a brain-damaged patient has been a great contribution to\nthe current distinction between ventral and dorsal streams for processing perception and\naction, respectively.\nControl participants:\nFor the functional imaging, we tested three normal healthy control participants\n(mean age = 30 years). For the behavioral tests of face perception, sixteen male and\nfemale undergraduates and two female age-matched controls (age 46 and 57 years)\n9served as control participants for most tests. For some tests, we did not include a control\ngroup.\nFMRI investigation of activation for face images\nStimuli:\nThis dataset was originally used to investigate functional activation for scenes,\nand therefore full details of fMRI methods can be found elsewhere (Steeves et al., 2004).\nAlso our functional imaging of D.F.'s brain included several different scene image\nconditions in addition to face images. During fMRI, D.F. viewed visual images of faces,\nnormally colored scenes, grayscale scenes, black and white scenes, or a fixation stimulus\nalone. The face stimuli consisted of color images of famous faces, 8 male and 8 female,\nseen from a frontal viewpoint on a black background. Scene images were taken from a\nCD photo image library. Faces and scenes subtended approximately the same retinal\nimage size (12 deg). Each stimulus epoch lasted 16 seconds, during which 16 different\nstimuli were presented for one sec each. Each stimulus condition was repeated four times\nwithin each run (with a fixation period every fifth epoch) in pseudo-random order. Two\nruns were obtained on D.F. For the control participants, the functional run presented\nblocks of 16 sec of fixation alternating between blocks of either 16 one sec face images\nor 16 one sec colored scene images, repeated for four cycles. In order to maintain\nattention, both D.F. and neurologically-intact participants were asked to press a button\nwhen they perceived a \u201cforest\u201d scene.\nData acquisition:\n10\nScans were conducted with a 4 -Tesla Siemens-Varian whole-body MRI system at\nthe Robarts Research Institute using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging\nand a head coil for functional images. A series of sagittal T1-weighted scout images were\nacquired to select 17 contiguous, 5 mm thick functional slices in a quasi-coronal\norientation, sampling the occipital and posterior temporal cortex. Each functional volume\nwas acquired using a navigator-echo-corrected, slice-interleaved multishot (2 shots) echo\nplanar imaging (EPI) pulse sequence with a 64 x 64 matrix size and a total volume\nacquisition time of 2 s [TE=15ms, flip angle=45 deg, FOV=19.2 cm]. Each imaging run\nconsisted of 140 consecutive acquisitions of the selected brain volume. Within the same\nimaging session, high-resolution inversion-prepared 3-D T1-weighted anatomical images\nwere acquired (64 slices, 256 X 256, 0.75 X 0.75 X 3 mm voxel size, TR = 9.8 ms TE =\n5.2 ms). In another session, participants were scanned using a cylindrical quadrature\nbirdcage-style radio-frequency (RF) coil. Functional images were manually realigned to\nhigh-resolution anatomical images (1 X 1 X 1) that sampled the whole brain in order to\nobtain full-brain anatomical images to allow computation of stereotaxic co-ordinates\n(Talairach & Tournoux, 1988).\nImage Analysis:\nAnalyses were carried out using Brain Voyager 4.6 software and functional\nimages underwent linear trend removal. General linear model analyses were performed\nwith separate predictors for each stimulus condition. Contrasts between predictors were\nused to identify regions of interest (e.g., +faces, -scenes). Areas were defined as all of the\ncontiguous activated voxels in the vicinity of the appropriate anatomical area that met a\nminimum threshold of p= 0.0001 for the FFA and p=1.7 x 10-8 for the PPA. Because the\n11\nfunctional run for D.F. included several scene conditions, for her we defined the FFA and\nPPA using the contrast between all three scene stimuli and the face stimuli. For control\nparticipants, the FFA and PPA were defined as a contrast between faces and scenes.\nResults:\nAnatomically, D.F. shows a pattern of diffuse brain damage, which is common\nwith hypoxia, but the concentration of damage is in bilateral ventral lateral-occipital\ncortex. The lesion is larger in the right than in the left hemisphere. There is also a smaller\nlesion in occipito-parietal region in the left hemisphere. The enlarged ventricles and sulci\nthroughout the brain indicate atrophy. Despite the abnormal appearance of regions\noutside the lesions, previous data indicates that these areas continue to show functional\nactivation (i.e. James et al., 2003; Steeves et al., 2004).\nIn all observers, including D.F., viewing faces produced greater activation in an\narea consistent with the FFA than did viewing scene images (p < 8.6 x 10-8). Viewing\nscene images produced greater activation in the PPA than did viewing faces (p < 0.01).\nFace images also produced greater activation in other cortical areas including STS in both\nD.F. and controls, and the OFA, but in the controls only. In fact, the OFA appears to be\nlocated well within D.F's bilateral LO lesions\u2014see panel C of Figure 1. Our Talairach\ncoordinates for these areas are consistent with those of earlier studies and are listed in\nTable 1 below. Figure 1 shows FFA activation on the ventral surface of D.F.'s brain\nrendered at the pial surface (A) as well as STS activation (C) but no OFA activation (D)\nis seen in either hemisphere. The dark gray areas in D.F.'s rendered brains (A, B) show\nthe location of her LO and PO lesions. In the control observer, face-selective activation is\nseen in the FFA (A), STS (C) and the OFA (B, D). The red line shown on the rendered\n12\nbrains in B represents the z-plane through which the locus of STS activation occurs in\nD.F. and the control. The blue line represents the z-plane of the OFA activation in the\ncontrol observer. This same z-plane is mapped onto D.F.'s brain in B and it is clear that\nthe OFA is well within D.F.'s LO lesion. There were small clusters of activation in each\nhemisphere of D.F.'s brain that did not overlap with the OFA of our controls but were\nrelatively nearby. In the left hemisphere, there were two small clusters on the border of\nher lesion that measured 0.08 cm3 and 0.05 cm3 but were more anterior and inferior than\nthe OFA of our control subjects [Talairach coordinates\u2014 cluster 1: -41, -67, -14; cluster\n2: -38, -72, -14; mean OFA controls: -40.7 (2.5), -79.3 (2.9), -9.7 (3.2)]. In the right\nhemisphere, there was a larger region of face-selective activation measuring 0.9 cm3 that\nwas more lateral than the OFA of our controls [Talairach coordinates\u2014 50, -70, -8; mean\nOFA controls: 36.7 (7.1), -74.7 (6.1), -9.7 (6.1)].\nIn order to better illustrate the bilateral FFA face-selective activation in patient\nD.F. Figure 2 shows axial slices through the FFA and STS in both D.F. and a control\nsubject. The activation that D.F. shows in the FFA is similar in the two hemispheres and\nis comparable to that seen in the control subject. STS cluster size is larger in patient D.F.\nthan in the control. The average time courses for face-selective activation are also shown\nin Figure 2. Patient D.F. shows similar face-selective BOLD signal to that of the\ncontrol\u2014 around 1%. Both D.F. and the control subject demonstrate larger % BOLD\nsignal change in the FFA than the STS.\n13\nFigure 1. Functional activation for face images in D.F. and one control subject.

Event-related average\ntime courses for face-selective activation are also shown. Activation cluster size is\nindicated below the time course.\n16\nTesting of Face Perception\nStimuli:\nFor all tests, stimuli were presented on a 17\" display or a 15\" laptop display. Depending\non the particular test, stimuli subtended approximately 4 to 8 degrees visual angle.\nSubjects indicated a response by pressing the left or right mouse button or by pressing\ndesignated keys on a keyboard. In some cases, the experimenter recorded the subject's\nresponse and as a result latencies were not measured. Stimuli were presented using\nSuperlab 2.0, Cedrus Corporation. Generally, trials were self-paced and conditions were\npseudo-randomized.\nMethods and Results\nFace categorization:\n1) Face\/non-face categorization with color\/texture manipulation\nWe designed a task to determine whether D.F. could discriminate a face from an\nobject and what role color and texture might play if such an ability exists, since for this\npatient colour and texture contribute to her ability to classify scenes (Steeves et al.,\n2004). One hundred and twenty two-alternative temporal forced-choice face\/object pair\ntrials were presented (25 trials of each pair\u2014gray faces\/gray objects, natural colored\nfaces\/natural colored objects, natural colored faces\/flesh-tone colored objects and gray\nfaces\/flesh-tone colored objects and 20 trials of line drawings of faces and objects).\nStimuli were presented for 100 ms each. The table below shows examples of stimuli from\neach face\/object pair. If color and texture are important for D.F. to discriminate faces as\nthey are for scene classification (Steeves et al, 2004) we predicted that she would be at\n17\nchance for three face discrimination conditions\u2014 gray faces\/gray objects where no color\ninformation was available at all; naturally colored faces\/flesh-tone colored objects where\nboth objects and faces had flesh-tone coloring; and line drawings of faces and objects\nwhere no colour information was available and in addition, texture information was at a\nminimum. We predicted that D.F. would make a larger number of errors for gray\nfaces\/flesh-tone colored objects where faces were grayscale and objects were in flesh-\ntones, and that she would perform above chance for naturally colored faces\/colored\nobjects where faces and objects were naturally colored. D.F., surprisingly, was able to\ndiscriminate a face from an object 95% overall. See table 2 below.\n18\n2) Free form image description\nBecause D.F. was able to easily discriminate a face from an object in test 1 using\na forced-choice paradigm, this test was designed to determine, in a non-forced choice\ndesign, whether faces are indeed a uniquely identifiable category for her. This test was\nconducted 1 year after the previous face categorization test and DF was not told ahead of\ntime that some of the stimuli would be faces. There were two test versions\u2014grayscale\nand line drawing, each containing 30 test images, 25 of which were objects such as a\nbathtub, coffee cup or kettle, while five were faces. Face images were in a frontal or near-\nfrontal view and 35% of greyscale images and 65% of the line drawings of objects were\nspatially symmetric. Different objects and faces were used in each version. D.F. was\nasked to describe what each image was. Images remained on the screen until she\nresponded. In both the line drawing and grayscale versions of this test, D.F. accurately\nidentified all five face images as \"a face\" but none of the objects.\n19\n3) Multiple-Category Categorization\nSubjects were required to categorize images to one of seven categories\u2014 faces,\nanimals, body parts, furniture, tools, vehicles, and words. Categories were divided into\ntwo blocks and faces were repeated in each block so that there were four categories per\nblock. (Block 1: animals, furniture, tools, faces; Block 2: body parts, vehicles, words,\nfaces.) There were two test versions per block\u2014a grayscale and a line drawing version,\nthe order of which was counterbalanced. Grayscale images were taken from the Hemera\nPhoto Objects Premium Image Collection, Hemera Technologies Inc. See top panel of\nFigure 2 for examples from each category and version. There were 20 different test\nimages per category in each block and test version, giving 80 images per run.\n20\nD.F. accurately categorized faces in both the grayscale and line drawing versions\nof the test, 100 and 95% correct, respectively. She also accurately categorized whole\nwords in each test version at 100 and 85% correct, respectively. See bottom left panel of\nFigure 3. When asked how she performed the task, D.F. said that it was easy to recognize\na face and a word, so she used an exclusion process for the other categories. For example,\nshe suggested that images that were long in extent were likely to be tools while\nrectangular images were likely to be furniture or vehicles. This meant that the most\ndifficult categories for her, body parts and animals, could be derived by exclusion of the\nother categories. This is well evidenced by response latencies, which demonstrate this\nspeed accuracy trade-off. That is, despite high accuracy rates for many categories, correct\nresponse latencies were fastest for faces and words but much slower (approximately 2 - 4\ntimes) for other categories. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)\ndemonstrated that there was a significant difference in correct response latencies between\ncategories [grayscale: F (6, 114) = 5.75; p \u2264 0.01; line drawing: F (6, 126) = 15.45; p \u2264\n0.01]. For both grayscale and line drawing test versions D.F. was fastest at categorizing\nfaces compared to all other categories (t-tests, p \u2264 0.01) except words (grayscale: t (36) =\n1.69, p = 0.09; line drawing: t (30) = 1.7, p = 0.37).  D.F. was also faster overall at\ncategorizing grayscale images compared to line drawings [ F (1,21) = 71.89; p \u2264 0.01].\nSee bottom right panel of Figure below.\n21\nFigure 3. Grayscale and line drawing examples from each of the seven image categories\nare shown above. Performance accuracy and latency for each image category are shown\nbelow in the left and right panels, respectively.\n4) Upright\/inverted face discrimination\nIn a spatial 2AFC design, two face images were presented side by side\u2014one was\nupright while the other was upside down. The subject was asked to indicate, as quickly as\npossible, whether the image on the left or the right was upright. There were 40 face pairs\nand each remained visible until the subject responded. Faces were grayscale and pairs\nwere matched so that illumination of the face was from the same direction in each image\npair in an attempt to eliminate this as a potential orientation cue. An example is shown in\n22\nthe Figure 4. We also used a single trial yes\/no paradigm, where subjects were presented\na face and were asked to indicate whether the face was upright or inverted. There were\ntwo versions of this test, one where face images were presented for 100 ms and another\nwhere faces remained visible until the subject responded. Subjects viewed 60 face images\nin each run\u2014half were inverted. In the spatial 2AFC design, D.F. was able to\ndiscriminate an upright from an inverted face at near normal levels\u2014see left panel in\nFigure 3. Similarly, D.F.'s sensitivity was also near normal on the yes\/no task when given\nunlimited viewing time. With a brief stimulus presentation, however, D.F. was unable to\ndiscriminate an upright from an inverted face\u2014see right panel of figure 4.\nFigure 4. Above, an example of an upright and inverted face which both have the\ndirection of illumination from below. Below, D.F.'s accuracy and sensitivity performance\nfor each test version compared to controls.\n5) Scrambled faces\n23\nUsing a single trial yes\/no paradigm, subjects were presented a grayscale face\nwith features in the normal arrangement or a face in which the features had been\nrearranged (scrambled) so that a mouth might appear where an eye should be, for\nexample (see Duchaine et al., 2003 for full details). Here, there were also two cases of\nfeature rearrangement for the scrambled faces\u2014one in which the normal T-shaped\nfeature configuration (two eyes laterally at the top with a nose and mouth in line below)\nwas maintained and one in which features were rearranged in different positions\u2014see\nFigure 5 for examples. There were two versions of this test, one in which face images\nwere presented for 100 ms and another in which faces remained visible until the subject\nresponded. We ran a second block of the two test versions in which all of the face stimuli\nwere rotated 90 deg in an attempt to determine the importance of the orientation of the T-\nshaped feature arrangement. When scrambled faces were presented upright and for an\nunlimited time, D.F. was able to discriminate a normal face from those with rearranged\nfeatures, although not at a completely normal level.  She was able to correctly reject all\nbut one scrambled face. See left panel of Figure 5. When faces were oriented sideways,\nD.F. was unable to discriminate a scrambled from a normal face no matter what the\nviewing time. Control observers' performance was little affected by this change in\norientation. See right panel of Figure 5.\n24\nFigure 5. Example images from the scrambled faces test: A\u2014a normal face with features\nin the normal arrangement, B\u2014a scrambled face where the features have been rearranged\n(scrambled) so that an eye appears where the mouth should be, and C\u2014a scrambled face\nwhere features are rearranged in different configuration. Sensitivity is shown below for\neach  stimulus duration.\n6) Half-faces\nGiven the findings of the previous test, we needed to further address whether or\nnot D.F. was using the T-shaped symmetrical arrangement of the features in a normal\nface configuration for categorizing an upright from an inverted face. We presented faces\nthat were partially occluded by a vertical black bar that covered half the face from the\nmidline to the side. See Figure 6. Sixty grayscale faces were taken from the set of normal\nfaces in the scrambled faces test. Faces were presented in an upright or inverted\norientation for an unlimited viewing time until the subject indicated whether the face was\nupright or upside down. D.F. was unable to discriminate an upright from an inverted face\n25\nwhen it was partially occluded from the midline. Her discrimination performance, 58%\ncorrect, was near chance.\nFigure 6. Partially occluded faces presented in an upright (A) or inverted (B) orientation.\n7) Mooney face\/non-face discrimination\nIn a spatial 2AFC design, a Mooney-like face and non-face were presented side\nby side. The subject was asked to indicate, as quickly as possible, whether the image on\nthe left or the right was a face. [Mooney non-face and face images were taken from the\nMooney Closure Test (Mooney, C.M., 1956).] An example pair is shown in Figure 7.\nThree blocks of fifteen face\/non-face pairs were presented.  Images were visible on the\nscreen until the subject responded and latencies were measured. Even though stimuli\nwere visible for an unlimited amount of time, D.F. was near chance at discriminating a\nMooney face from a non-face. Control observers' performance was near 100%. See\nFigure 7.\n26\nFigure 7. At top, a Mooney face\/non-face pair\u2014a face and a group of tomatoes. D.F's\naccuracy and latency performance are shown below.\n8) Upright\/inverted Mooney face discrimination\nIn a spatial 2AFC design, subjects were shown 20 Mooney face pairs from the set\nin the previous experiment. One was upright and the other upside down. Subjects were\nasked to indicate whether the image on the left or the right was upright. See Figure 8 for\nan example. Similar to her performance on Mooney face\/non-face discrimination, D.F.\nwas unable to discriminate an upright from an inverted Mooney face. (See Figure 8).\n27\nFigure 8. An example of an upright and inverted Mooney face. D.F.'s accuracy is shown\nbelow.\n9) Detection of composite faces in art\nWe showed patient D.F. a series of twelve paintings by Italian artist Giuseppe\nArcimboldo, which were images of faces composed of objects (see below left for an\nexample). We asked her to describe what she saw. D.F. was only able to recognize one of\nthe twelve paintings (Figure 9, right) as that of a face. She described the painting below\nas \"a man with a funny hat on\".\n28\nFigure 9. \"Autumn\" (L'autunno) by Giuseppe Arcimboldo, 1573\nHigher-level face processing: Face recognition\n1) Old\/New face discrimination\nTwo versions of old\/new face discrimination tests were used that consisted of two\ndifferent sets of grayscale frontal view photographs of female faces (see Duchaine,  et al.,\n(2003) and Duchaine & Nakayama, in press for full details of the test). Figure 10 shows\nexamples from each old\/new discrimination test version. Participants studied ten target\nfaces and were then asked with a series of single images to judge whether each was one\nof the previously studied target faces or a new non-target face. Each target face was\nshown twice (20 target presentations, 30 non-target presentations) within the test phase.\nD.F. scored very poorly on both versions of face old\/new discrimination compared to\ncontrols. On both versions, using signal detection, her false alarm rate was higher than\nher hit rate. On version 2, D.F. also had a higher tendency to respond \u201cyes\u201d than \"no\"\nsince her false alarm rate significantly exceeded her miss rate. Further, D.F.\u2019s response\n29\nlatencies were more than twice as slow as that of control observers. These slower\nresponse latencies cannot be attributed to slower motoric responses since D.F.\u2019s\nmovement kinematics for reaching and grasping are within normal limits (Goodale,\nJakobson & Keillor, 1994) but rather must be attributed to her difficulty with the task of\nface recognition. Other cases of prosopagnosia show long response latencies for face\nrecognition as well (Duchaine, 2000, Newcombe, 1979, Nunn et al., 2001). Results are\nshown in the Figure 10.\nFigure 10. Example face images that were used in each old\/new face discrimination test\nversion are shown below the graphs of performance accuracy and latency.\nSince D.F. was unable to recognize faces in a basic old\/new paradigm, we have\nincluded the results of two other tests of face recognition, which controlled for potential\ncues for face recognition that the basic old\/new paradigm did not, in the supplemental\ninformation. In summary, one of these tests required face matching across different\n30\ndirections of illumination and the other tested for face matching from a frontal to a 3\/4\nprofile view. D.F. was unable to recognize faces in either of these tests.\n4) Recognition of Famous Faces:\nParticipants were presented 60 images of famous individuals such as Margaret\nThatcher, John F. Kennedy, Princess Diana, Martin Luther King, and Audrey Hepburn\nwho would have been known to D.F. prior to her brain injury. (See Duchaine (2000) for\nfull details of this test.) Subjects were asked to name the individual or to give any\ninformation such as the individual\u2019s profession that could uniquely identify the face\nimage. Images were presented for 5 s and trials were self-paced. D.F. was unable to\nrecognize any of the famous faces. In contrast, the two age-matched controls were able to\nidentify on average 93% of the set of famous faces. Yet D.F. was knowledgeable of\nfamous individuals, and offered names such as 'Woody Allen' and 'Marilyn Monroe'.\nFurther, since D.F. was unable to correctly name any of the famous faces we asked her to\nsimply make a basic level gender classification for each famous face. She could not,\nhowever, reliably say whether a face was male or female.\nFigure 11. Examples of famous faces shown in the test of famous face recognition. \\\nHigher-level Face Processing: Gender Discrimination:\nVersion 1: Subjects were shown 200 color face images\u2014100 male and 100 female.\n31\nFaces were provided by the Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in\nTuebingen, Germany. Subjects were required to indicate whether the face was male or\nfemale and images remained visible until the subject responded. Version 2: Subjects also\nwere tested on their ability to discriminate the gender of grayscale faces embedded in\nspatial noise. Forty male and 40 female faces were presented for 300 ms each. Example\nimages in each version of the gender discrimination test are shown below. D.F.\nperformed poorly on both versions (color and grayscale) of the gender discrimination task\nwhile controls performed these tasks reasonably well. (See Figure 12).\nFigure 12. An example of a female and a male face image for each gender discrimination\ntest version.\nHigher-level Face Processing: Recognition of Emotional Expression:\n32\nUsing a spatial 2AFC design, subjects were shown 60 pairs of faces. In one run,\nsubjects were asked to discriminate between the face that showed a happy facial\nexpression and another facial expression. In another run using different face pairs,\nsubjects were asked to discriminate between the face that showed disgust\/displeasure and\nanother facial expression. We tested recognition of both happiness and\ndisgust\/displeasure since there can be a dissociation between recognition of these two\nemotions in some neurological patients (Sprengelmeyer et al., 1996). Controls'\ndiscrimination performance was at 88% or higher while D.F.'s performance was near\nchance. (See Figure 13).\nFigure 13. The top panel shows an example of face pairs where, on the left one face\nexhibits a happy facial expression and on the right, one face shows disgust\/displeasure.\nAccuracy and latency performance for D.F. and controls is shown below.\n33\nShape\/ Pattern Recognition:\nIt has been demonstrated in healthy controls that concentric patterns are more\neffective at activating the FFA than radial and conventional vertical sinusoidal patterns\n(Wilkinson et al., 2000). Since D.F. has an intact and functionally active FFA we thought\nshe might be able to recognize circular patterns but not lines and also discriminate\ncircular from radial patterns. In a match-to-sample design, we tested D.F.'s ability to\nrecognize patterns or shapes. She was shown a pattern\/shape for 2s and then a pair of\npatterns\/shapes appeared for an unlimited viewing time. Matching pattern\/shape pairs\nwere as follows: horizontal or vertical bars, oblique bars clockwise or counterclockwise,\nradial or concentric patterns and hyperbolic patterns at 0 or 90\u00ba orientation. Spatial\nfrequency of each pattern was varied. Twelve of each pattern\/shape pair was presented.\nD.F. was unable to recognize shapes in the match-to-sample pattern task\u2014her\nperformance was just below chance (Figure 14). We speculated that since the concentric\nand radial patterns were both contained within a circle and similarly, since the other\npatterns were contained within a square, this may have been too difficult a judgment to\nmake. We then designed a more straightforward 4-alternative forced-choice shape\ndiscrimination task, in which we showed patient D.F. pictures of open or filled circles,\nsquares, diamonds and triangles. She was told the four possible shape categories in\nadvance and viewed nine shapes from each category. She was able to categorize most\nbasic shapes in this simpler task, given the 4 categories in advance. Her performance for\ncategorizing circles and squares was 100 per cent and for triangles, 89 per cent correct.\nDiamond shapes were the only difficult shape (55 % correct), which were most\nfrequently confused for a triangle. Comparing D.F.'s ability on these two shape\/pattern\n34\nrecognition tasks, she was better able to make discriminations when stimuli differed in\ntheir overall global shape.\nFigure 14. Percent correct performance in the match-to-sample shape discrimination task.\nD.F.'s performance is near chance for all 4 categories.\nDiscussion:\nWe find functional brain activation for face images in an area that is consistent\nwith the fusiform face area (FFA) in both patient D.F. and neurologically-intact control\nsubjects. This is a remarkable finding given that D.F. demonstrates severe prosopagnosia\nin addition to profound visual form agnosia. The FFA is commonly thought to be 'the'\n35\nface processing area, given that it has been implicated in several decades of reports of\nlesions in patients with prosopagnosia and has been activated in more recent functional\nimaging studies of neurologically-intact individuals when viewing faces. In the present\npaper, in addition to reporting face-selective activation in the FFA, we have also\nperformed extensive behavioural tests in the same patient. D.F. can discriminate a face\nfrom an object or a non-face, but cannot perform higher-level face tasks including\nrecognition of identity, gender, or emotional expression. Her deficit is restricted to the\naspects of higher-level face processing.\nD.F. shows clearly intact and functional fusiform gyri bilaterally but destroyed\noccipital face areas bilaterally. The FFA activation appears to be of reasonable size and\nshows normal BOLD signal change in both hemispheres. The presence of face-selective\nactivation, however, is not necessarily evidence of normal function. It will be necessary\nto test this patient further for face-specific functional modulation of areas in the face\nnetwork in order to address the functional integrity of these remaining face-selective\nareas. Our control observers all demonstrate OFA activation for faces, but patient D.F.\ndoes not show activation in either hemisphere in an area consistent with the OFA. It is\npossible that the small areas of activation nearby but not overlapping with the OFA of our\ncontrols could represent remapping of OFA activation or recruitment of other brain\nregions for face-selectivity.  Taken together, our behavioural and imaging data from this\npatient suggest that it is likely that a fully intact complex face network including\nundamaged connections with the OFA are necessary to drive higher-level face\nprocessing.\n36\nHow do our findings compare to those of others who have measured functional\nactivation for faces in patients with prosopagnosia? On one hand, with respect to fusiform\nactivation, this finding is relatively compatible with two recent studies, which have also\nshown FFA activation in patients with prosopagnosia. Rossion et al. (2003) show face-\nselective activation in the right fusiform gyrus in a patient with acquired prosopagnosia.\nHasson et al. (2003) report that the activation for faces in their congenital prosopagnosia\npatient is normal with respect to the anatomical location, activation profiles and\nhemispheric laterality of the FFA in controls. On the other hand, two earlier studies by\nMarotta, Genovese and Behrmann (2001) and Hadjikhani and de Gelder (2002) report\nthat the activation for faces in the fusiform gyrus in their patients with acquired and early\nprosopagnosia, respectively, is not normal compared to controls.\nThe cortical damage in one of Marotta et al. (2001) patients was right anterior and\nposterior temporal while in the other the damage was to the right temporal and medial\noccipital lobes and the right fusiform gyrus. These patients, however, exhibited more\nfunctional activation for faces in the anterior portion of the fusiform gyrus than did\ncontrols and one patient showed more left than right hemisphere activation. The authors\ndid not test for OFA activity in their study, however. The stereotaxic coordinates of the\nlocus of face-selective fusiform activation in one of their patients in particular, were\naltogether more anterior than those of their controls, which may account for the overall\nmore anterior activation in the fusiform gyrus. Similarly, Hadjikhani and de Gelder\n(2002) did not find normal face-selective activation in the FFA nor the inferior occipital\ngyrus (IOG) in their patients with developmental or childhood prosopagnosia but they did\nfind some relatively normal activation in object-selective areas during object viewing.\n37\nTheir subjects performed just below normal on the Benton and Warrington face\nrecognition tests but exhibited no evident lesions on the MR scan.\nIn the present study, however, we find the anatomical location of face-selective\nfusiform activation in D.F. to be consistent with those of our control observers and\nfurther, that these coordinates are similar to those seen in normal observers by others (e.g.\nKanwisher, McDermott & Chun 1997; Epstein & Kanwisher, 1998). We also find OFA\nand STS activation in our controls, as do earlier studies of face-selective activation (e.g.\nKanwisher et al., 1997; McCarthy et al., 1997; Puce et al., 1995) Patient D.F. also shows\nSTS activation, but no OFA activation consistent with that of our controls. This appears\nto be because her lateral occipital lesions in both hemispheres overlap with the\nanatomical locus of the OFA. Hasson et al. (2003) studied a congenital prosopagnosic\nwho was unable to recognize famous faces but who could recognize face gender, age and\nemotional expression. As is often the case with congenital cases, no evident structural\nlesion was revealed on MR scan. Their patient showed activation in areas consistent with\nthe FFA and the OFA within the lateral occipital area. Talairach coordinates for these\nareas are comparable to those of our controls. But, the interesting result in the Hasson et\nal. (2003) study, is that there were subtle differences in selectivity for faces in the left\nfrom the right OFA of their patient. Given our findings, these differences could account\nfor this patient's inability to recognize known faces despite preserved processing of other\nhigher-level face attributes including recognition of gender, age and emotional\nexpression. This is consistent with our supposition that a functionally intact complex face\nnetwork including undamaged connections with the OFA is indeed more important than\nsuspected for such higher-level face processing.\n38\nRossion et al. (2003) tested a patient with left middle fusiform damage and right\ninferior occipital damage (presumably including the right OFA) but an intact right middle\nfusiform gyrus and left OFA. Behaviorally, although impaired compared to their control\nsubjects on tests of face recognition, their patient still performed well above chance on\ntests of gender decision and recognition of emotional expression and was normal in her\nability to assess the age of faces. Their patient showed left inferior occipital cortex\nresponses for faces, which likely corresponds to the OFA, in an area posterior to the\ndamaged area in one of the two scanning sessions. Given that both Hasson et al. (2003)\nand Rossion et al. (2003) found some face-selective activation, although abnormal, in the\nOFA and that their two patients have some residual higher-level face processing abilities\nincluding recognition of gender, age and emotional expression it seems likely that the\nOFA or its interconnections are partially damaged in these patients but those that remain\nare adequate to help drive these residual higher-level face processes. An earlier PET\nstudy by Sergent, Ohta and MacDonald (1992) also implicates the OFA in aspects of\nhigher-level face processing. Specifically, they found activation changes in right\nextrastriate cortex for gender recognition and additional bilateral activation of the\nfusiform gyrus for a face recognition task. The data from patient D.F. show that she has\nno activation in an area consistent with the OFA in either hemisphere and no higher-level\nface processing abilities. It is highly likely that face recognition involves a complex face\nnetwork requiring intact connections with the OFA area for face processing beyond basic\nface categorization. Again, further research is needed to determine whether D.F.'s face-\nselective activation in the fusiform revealed by a localizer is indicative of normal\n39\nfunctionality and also whether she shows remapping of the OFA in areas outside of that\nof our controls.\n How capable is D.F. at face categorization? To summarize the behavioral data:\nD.F. can differentiate faces from non-faces given sufficient texture information and\nprocessing time, and this is independent of color and illumination information. She can\nuse configural information when presented in an upright but not sideways orientation and\ngiven that she also cannot discriminate half-faces she may rely on a spatially symmetric\nfeature arrangement. Moreover, faces appear to be a unique category, which she can\nclassify even when she has no advance knowledge that she will be shown face images.\nD.F. cannot make any higher-level discriminations requiring recognition of known faces,\nemotion, or gender. In short, D.F. is a unique patient demonstrating a severe impairment\nin all aspects of higher-level face processing but relatively spared face categorization.\nIt is possible that D.F. is able to categorize internally symmetrical stimuli as faces\nwithout actually seeing them as faces. However, a large number of object images from\nwhich she discriminated faces were also spatially symmetric. Given her good\nperformance on basic shape discrimination but poor performance on pattern\ndiscrimination when contained within similar global shapes, it is possible that patient\nD.F. initially uses differences in global shape to help her distinguish faces from other\nobjects. It would be useful in future research to test D.F.'s ability to discriminate faces\nfrom other non-face stimuli with similar internal symmetry and also faces from other\nnon-face stimuli with similar global shape, such as flowers or round fruit. In addition, it\nwould be worthwhile to test functional activation in the face-processing network with\nsymmetrical versus non-symmetrical shapes as well as images with similar and different\n40\nglobal shape in order to address the role of different components of this network in basic\nconfigural processing in D.F.\nSeveral imaging studies in neurologically-intact humans have made the case that\nthe FFA is involved in face categorization but not necessarily higher-level face\nrecognition. For instance, Kanwisher, Tong and Nakayama (1998) also demonstrated that\nface discrimination is better for upright than inverted grayscale faces but activation in the\nFFA is only slightly lower for the latter condition.  Haxby et al., (1999) demonstrated\nsimilar findings\u2014inverted faces do not selectively diminish the response to faces in face-\nselective regions. Tong et al., (2000) demonstrated that the FFA responds well to human,\nanimal and cartoon faces but responds less to schematic faces or facial features alone. It\nseems likely that configural face information is processed in the FFA since patients with\nright fusiform face area damage show deficits in configural processing (Barton et al.,\n2002). These findings suggest that the FFA plays a role in conscious detection of a face\npossibly by representing the local features and global configuration of a face.\nConfigural information may nonetheless be used to identify individual faces.\nGauthier et al., (2000) showed that when subjects attend to the location of faces rather\nthan identity, activity in the FFA and OFA is higher for presentations of different faces\nthan presentation of the same face repeatedly. They argue that the FFA is involved in\nspecific individual-level face processing. It is likely the case that the FFA does indeed\nprocess information that is ultimately necessary for individual-level face recognition such\nas face configuration and feature arrangement. Patient D.F. does appear to use spatially\nsymmetric configural information for face categorization and shows FFA activation for\nfaces. However, our data suggest that it is likely that an intact complex network is\n41\nnecessary for this same configural information to be used for higher-level recognition\ntasks, such as identity and expression. Rossion et al., (2003) make a similar argument that\nthe face-selective activation in the earlier visual area, the OFA, could result from\nfeedback connections from the FFA to the OFA. The FFA may process higher-level face-\nsensitive information that is ultimately used for fine-grained visual analysis of faces at\nthe individual level through feedback connections to the OFA.\nAs a final point, one should certainly exercise caution when interpreting data from\nsingle-patient studies given individual variability with respect to lesions and behavioral\nperformance. Further, the site of a lesion does not necessarily correspond to the locus of\nthe area responsible for perceptual\/cognitive processing which is disrupted but could\ninstead correspond to an interruption in the pathways to other areas where such\nprocessing is accomplished. When interpreting data from the present case of patient D.F.,\none must bear in mind that she does have profound agnosia of the apperceptive type,\naffecting more than just higher-level face processing. Nonetheless, these data in\nconjunction with those from other neuropsychological patients [i.e. Rossion et al., 2003;\nHasson et al., 2003] contribute to a clearer picture of necessity of an intact complex face\nnetwork in face processing. Patient D.F. has undamaged and functionally active FFAs but\ndestroyed OFAs in both hemispheres and she also demonstrates a clear behavioral deficit\nin all aspects of face processing beyond categorization. These data lend strong support to\nthe importance of the integrity of a complex network of regions for face identification,\nincluding more than just the FFA\u2014in particular the OFA, a region believed to be\nassociated with low-level processing.\n42\nAcknowledgements\nForemost, we thank patient D.F. for her patience and continued willingness to participate\nin our experiments.

This test attempted to reduce the use of feature\nmatching strategies by not presenting target and test stimuli simultaneously but rather by\nrequiring the subject to recognize 15 different photographs of a target individual, which\ndiffer in illumination, out of 150 photographs presented in succession (from Duchaine,\n2000). See top panel Figure 1S for example images of the same face under different\ndirections of illumination. Initially, the subject studied three grayscale photographs of the\ntarget individual that were cycled three times for three seconds each. In the test phase, the\nsubject viewed each of the 150 test faces and was asked to indicate as quickly as possible\nwhether of not the photograph was of the target individual. The face image remained on\nthe screen until the subject responded. D.F. was significantly poorer at discriminating\nbetween target and distractor faces than control subjects. Her false alarm rate was again\nhigher than her hit rate. Results are shown in Figure 1S. Again, D.F.\u2019s response latencies\nwere considerably slower than those for the control observers.\n44\nFigure 1S. In the top panel, A shows an example of a face learned during the study phase\nand B through D show that same individual under different illumination in the test phase.\nAccuracy and latency performance for D.F. and controls are shown below.\nFace matching\u2014frontal to 3\/4 profile\nIn a match-to-sample design, subjects were shown a frontal view of a face in\ngrayscale for 3 sec, which was followed immediately by three 3\/4 profile photos, one of\nwhich was the same individual seen previously (from Duchaine, 2000). The subject was\nasked to indicate which of the three photos was the individual seen previously from a\nfrontal view. A run consisted of 30 trials, fifteen of which contained adult male faces and\nfifteen contained adult female faces. Both undergraduate and age-matched controls\naveraged more than 90% correct face matching while D.F. performed just above chance.\n(Figure 2S).\n45\nFigure 2S. The top panel shows an example of a frontal view of a face to be recognized in\nthe adjacent three 3\/4 profile faces. Performance accuracy is shown below.\n46\nReferences\nBarton JJS, Press DZ, Keenan JP, O'Connor M. Lesions of the fusiform face area impair\nperception of facial configuration in prosopagnosia.
