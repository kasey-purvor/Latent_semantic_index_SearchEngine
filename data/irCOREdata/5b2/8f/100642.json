China and\n2)Department of Physics, University of Surrey, Guildford, GU2 7XH, United Kingdom\n(Dated: February 2, 2008)\nWe discuss the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule violation effects in \u03b7c \u2192 V V in light of the new\ndata from BES Collaboration. In particular, a possible non-vanishing branching ratio for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6\nprovides a hint of the degrees of OZI violations based on a recent factorization proposed for char-\nmonium hadronic decays. The violation mechanism is studied via an intermediate meson exchange\nmodel. The results are consistent with the experimental observations.\nThe new data from BES Collaboration for \u03b7c \u2192 V V [1], where V denotes vector meson, revive the question about\nthe role played by non-perturbative QCD processes. In particular, an upper limit for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 branching ratio, which\nis the same order of magnitude as that for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6, initiates renewed interests in possible OZI-rule [2] violations\nin charmonium hadronic decays. Since the flavor wavefunctions of \u03c9 and \u03c6 are nearly ideally mixing, i.e. \u03c6 meson\nis a pure ss\u00af and \u03c9, pure nn\u00af \u2261 (uu\u00af + dd\u00af)\/\u221a2, in the limit where the OZI-rule applies, the branching ratio for the\ndoubly OZI disconnected (DOZI) process \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 is expected to vanish, or at least be much smaller than the singly\nOZI disconnected (SOZI) processes such as \u03b7c \u2192 K\u2217K\u00af\u2217, etc. Therefore, a possible non-negligible branching ratio for\n\u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 would be a direct evidence for the break-down of pQCD in the low-lying charmonium hadronic decays, for\nwhich the dynamical reason needs to be understood. Some theoretical attempts towards a dynamical understanding\nof \u03b7c \u2192 V V can be found in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\nA dynamical prescription for the OZI violations in the charmonium hadronic decays can be the intermediate meson\nexchange mechanism [9, 10]. As proposed in Ref. [11], the DOZI processes could be dual with the intermediate meson\nexchanges, which is in analogue with Geiger and Isgur\u2019s study [12] of OZI violation mechanisms. For J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V f0 [11],\nwe found that the OZI violations via the intermediate meson exchanges accounted for the branching ratio patterns\narising from J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V f i0, where i = 1, 2, 3 denote f0(1710), f0(1500) and f0(1370). Similarly, this prescription can\nbe applied to \u03b7c \u2192 V V , where the intermediate meson exchanges could be a natural explanation for a non-vanishing\n\u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 decay.\nIn this letter, we provide a coherent analysis for \u03b7c \u2192 V V based on a recently proposed factorization scheme [13].\nBy determining the OZI-violation parameter defined in the factorization, we will be able to predict the range of\nbranching ratio magnitude for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6. We then investigate this DOZI process by applying the intermediate meson\nexchange mechanism. Conclusion and some discussions will be given in the end.\nIn the factorization scheme [13], the DOZI process is distinguished from the SOZI ones by the gluon counting\nrule. Namely, we assume that the transition amplitude of DOZI process has a strength of r times that of SOZI\ndue to additional gluon exchange. We also introduce the SU(3) flavor breaking parameter R, of which its deviation\nfrom unity reflects the change of couplings due to the mass difference between u\/d and s. The third parameter t is\nintroduced to describe the coupling difference between gluon-qq\u00af and gluon-glueball. For \u03b7c \u2192 V V , the transitions will\nnot involve parameters t since we treat \u03b7c as a pure cc\u00af state. Finally, the gluon-qq\u00af coupling is defined by parameter\ng0. As shown in Ref. [13], g0 is a stable quantity insensitive to \u03c70,2 \u2192 V V and PP . This property reflects that the\ngluon-qq\u00af coupling has a universal value at the same energy region.\nBased on the above simple scheme, the transition amplitudes for \u03b7c \u2192 V V can be expressed as\n\u3008\u03c6\u03c6|V\u02c6gg |\u03b7c\u3009 = g20R2(1 + r)\n\u3008\u03c9\u03c9|V\u02c6gg|\u03b7c\u3009 = g20(1 + 2r)\n\u3008\u03c9\u03c6|V\u02c6gg |\u03b7c\u3009 = g20rR\n\u221a\n2\n\u3008K\u2217+K\u2217\u2212|V\u02c6gg|\u03b7c\u3009 = g20R\n\u3008\u03c1+\u03c1\u2212|V\u02c6gg|\u03b7c\u3009 = g20 . (1)\nwhere V\u02c6gg is the \u03b7c \u2192 gg \u2192 (qq\u00af)(qq\u00af) potential. The amplitudes for other charge combinations of K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 and \u03c1\u03c1 are\nthe same.\nA commonly used form factor is adopted in the calculation of the partial decay widths:\nF2(p) = p2l exp(\u2212p2\/8\u03b22) , (2)\nwhere p and l are the three momentum and relative angular momentum of the final-state mesons, respectively, in the\n\u03b7c rest frame. We adopt \u03b2 = 0.5 GeV, which is the same as in Refs. [13, 14, 15, 16]. Such a form factor will largely\naccount for the size effects from the spatial wavefunctions of the initial and final state mesons.\nIn Ref. [1], branching ratios for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1,K\u2217K\u00af\u2217, \u03c6\u03c6 are measured with improved error bars compared with PDG [17],\nand upper limits for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c9 and \u03c9\u03c6 are estimated. In particular, the upper limit, BR\u03b7c\u2192\u03c9\u03c6 < 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123, is the\nsame order of magnitude as BR\u03b7c\u2192\u03c6\u03c6 = (2.5\u00b1 0.5\u00b1 0.9)\u00d7 10\u22123, which implies that large OZI violations might exist\nin \u03b7c \u2192 V V .\nAdopting the data of Ref. [1], we make two fittings in the factorization scheme. The parameters are listed in Table I\nand the fitting results are presented in Table II. In Fit-I, the three parameters, r, R and g0, are determined by fitting\nthe branching ratios for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1, K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 and \u03c6\u03c6. Since there are three parameters to be fitted by three experimental\ndata, the negligibly-small \u03c72 reflects the fact that one can also determine the parameters by solving the three variable\nequations. Interestingly, large errors are found with the OZI violation parameter r. With these fitted parameters the\npredicted branching ratios for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c9 are nearly as large as two times the experimental upper limit. This reflects\nthe lack of information about the parameter correlations among the three channels: \u03c1\u03c1, K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 and \u03c6\u03c6. For instance,\nthe decay of \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1 only involves g0, thus, can be directly determined by the branching ratio without interferences\nwith the K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 and \u03c6\u03c6 channels. Due to this, the price to pay for a \u201cprecise\u201d fit for \u03c1\u03c1, K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 and \u03c6\u03c6 is that\nthe predictions for \u03c9\u03c9 and \u03c9\u03c6 channels will bear much larger uncertainties though they can still be regarded as in\nagreement with the data (see Fit-I of Table II).\nIn order to put more constraints on the determination of the parameters and examine their sensitivity to the\nexperimental upper limits for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c9 and \u03c9\u03c6, we set their branching ratios to be BR\u03b7c\u2192\u03c9\u03c9 = (3.1 \u00b1 3.1) \u00d7 10\u22123\nand BR\u03b7c\u2192\u03c9\u03c6 = (0.6\u00b1 0.6)\u00d7 10\u22123, i.e. assuming that the most probable values are at the half values of their upper\nlimits. We then obtain Fit-II in Table I and II with a reasonably small \u03c72, i.e. \u03c72 = 0.5. The fitted branching ratios\nfor \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c6\u03c6 and \u03c1\u03c1 are found smaller than the experimental central values, while that for K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 turns out to be\nlarger though all these are well within the uncertainty of the data. Nevertheless, we find that the fitted values for \u03c9\u03c9\nand \u03c9\u03c6 are now well below the experimental upper limits.\nCompared with Fit-I, the uncertainties for r in Fit-II are improved; g0 does not experience significant changes; and\nthe SU(3) flavor symmetry seems to be better respected. This feature not only confirms that the new data from BES\nare more consistent with the expectations based on the SU(3) flavor symmetry [1], but also suggests that the OZI\nviolations are phenomena different from the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking. Moreover, the value, g0 \u223c 0.36 GeV1\/2,\nis stable and close to that found in \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V (g0 \u2243 0.25 GeV1\/2) [13]. Since g20 is proportional to the value of the\ncc\u00af wavefunction at its origin, these results indicate some dynamical similarities between \u03b7c \u2192 V V and \u03c7c0,2 \u2192 V V ,\nand can be regarded as a consistent test of the factorization scheme.\nTo show the uncertainties bearing with the predictions for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 and \u03c9\u03c9, we also present the root mean square\nerrors for these two channels in both fittings.\nNote that \u03b7c has large branching ratios to \u03c1\u03c1 and K\n\u2217K\u00af\u2217 in its two-body decays. These transitions can occur via\nSOZI processes, while \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 can only occur via DOZI ones. This is a natural explanation for the branching ratio\nsuppression for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 in comparison with that for \u03b7c \u2192 K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 and \u03c1\u03c1. However, note that both \u03c9 and \u03c6 have\nsizeable couplings to K\u2217K\u00af + c.c. and \u03c1\u03c0 [17]. It implies that the K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 (and\/or \u03c1\u03c1) rescattering into \u03c9\u03c6 via kaon\n(and\/or pion) as shown by Fig. 1, could lead to sizeable contributions from the DOZI processes and be the major\nsource for the OZI violations.\nTo estimate the meson exchange contributions to \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6, we evaluate the meson loop transitions and express the\ntransition amplitude as follows:\nMfi =\n\u222b\nd4p2\n(2\u03c0)4\n\u03b44(P0 \u2212 P\u03c6 \u2212 P\u03c9)\n\u2211\nK\u2217pol.\nTaTbTc\na1a2a3\nF(p22) , (3)\nwhere the vertex functions are\nTa \u2261 iga\nM0\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4p\n\u03b1\n1 \u01eb\n\u03b2\n1p\n\u03b3\n3\u01eb\n\u03b4\n3,\nTb \u2261 igb\nM\u03c6\n\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03be\u03c4p\n\u00b5\n\u03c6\u01eb\n\u03bd\n\u03c6p\n\u03be\n1\u01eb\n\u03c4\n1 ,\nTc \u2261 igc\nM\u03c9\n\u01eb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03c3p\n\u03bb\n\u03c9\u01eb\n\u03b9\n\u03c9p\n\u03ba\n3\u01eb\n\u03c3\n3 , (4)\nwhere ga, gb and gc are coupling constants at the meson interaction vertices (see Fig. 1); Note that the tensor part\nof the vector meson propagator will not contribute. The four-vectors, P0, P\u03c6 and P\u03c9, are momenta for the initial\n\u03b7c and final state \u03c6 and \u03c9 mesons, while p1, p2 and p3 are four momenta for the intermediate mesons, respectively.\nQuantities, a1 = p\n2\n1 \u2212m21, a2 = p22 \u2212m22 and a3 = p23 \u2212m23, are the denominators of the propagators of intermediate\nmesons.\nBy applying the Cutkosky rule to the loop integration, we can reduce the transition amplitude to be\nMfi =\n\u2212igagbgc|p3|\n128\u03c02M\u03c6M\u03c9M20\n\u01eb\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03b4P\u03c9\u03bb\u01eb\u03c9\u03b9P\u03c6\u03ba\u01eb\u03c6\u03b4I, (5)\nwith\nI \u2261\n\u222b\np22[2p\n2\n2 + 2(P\n2\n\u03c6 \u2212 p21)\u2212 P\u03c6 \u00b7 P\u03c9 ]F(p22)\np22 \u2212m22\nd\u2126 . (6)\nIn the above the integration is over the azimuthal angles of the momentum p1 respect to the momentum of the final\nstate \u03c6 meson, and p22 = (P\u03c6\u2212p1)2 = M2\u03c6+m21\u22122E\u03c6E1+2|P\u03c6||p1| cos \u03b8. The coupling constant ga can be determined\nby the experimental data for \u03b7c \u2192 K\u2217K\u00af\u2217, which is an SOZI process and one of the largest channels in the \u03b7c decay:\ng2a =\n4\u03c0M20\n|p1|3 \u0393\u03b7c\u2192K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 , (7)\nwhere \u0393\u03b7c\u2192K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 = 10.4\u00d7 10\u22123\u0393tot = 0.18 MeV.\nSince the exchanged particles are correlated at those three vertices and the charge combination factor has been\nincluded in the derived coupling constant ga, we determine the gb and gc by the SU(3) relation in comparison with\ng\u03c9\u03c10pi0 :\ngb = g\u03c6K\u22170K\u00af0 = g\u03c6K\u2217+K\u2212 =\n\u221a\n2g\u03c9\u03c10pi0 =\n\u221a\n2g\u03c9\u03c1+pi\u2212 ,\ngc = g\u03c9K\u22170K\u00af0 = g\u03c9K\u00af\u22170K0 = g\u03c9K\u2217+K\u2212 = g\u03c9K\u2217\u2212K+ = g\u03c9\u03c10pi0 , (8)\nwith g2\u03c9\u03c10pi0 \u2243 84 determined in vector meson dominance model in \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c00e+e\u2212 [17]. However, the SU(3) flavor\nsymmetry is generally broken. For example, the SU(3) flavor symmetry gives g\u03c6\u03c1pi = 0. But we know that the decay\nof \u03c6\u2192 \u03c1\u03c0 has sizeable branching ratios [17]. To include the contributions from Fig. 1(b), we adopt BR\u03c6\u2192\u03c1pi+pi+pi\u2212pi0 =\n15.4% as an upper limit to derive g\u03c6\u03c1pi.\nWe also note that the application of the Cutkosky rule to the meson loop integration for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 requires a sufficient\nconsideration of the non-locality of the V V P couplings in the final state. As shown by Eq. (6), the integrand has a\npower of p22, which suggests that the meson loop integral may not be necessarily suppressed compared with the tree\ndiagram without form factor. Therefore, a form factor to take care of the non-locality of the two V V P vertices are\nneeded. This issue is correlated to the off-shell effects from the exchanged light pseudoscalar meson. Following the\nargument of Ref. [18], we adopt a dipole form factor to account for the non-locality for the two V V P vertices and\noff-shell effects from the exchanged meson. This should be a natural treatment for the intermediate meson exchange\nmodel. As follows, we will list the integration results for three cases: i) with no form factor; ii) with a monopole form\nfactor; and iii) with a dipole form factor. We then concentrate on the numerical results from (iii) due to the reason\nmentioned above.\ni) With no form factor, i.e. F(p22) = 1, the integral becomes:\nI = 8\u03c0|P\u03c6||p1|\nC\n[\n2\u2212 2(A\u2212B)C\nB2\n\u2212 (A\u2212B)(C \u2212B)\nB3\nln\n1\u2212B\n1 +B\n]\n, (9)\nwhere the factors are\nA \u2261 2|P\u03c6||p1|\nM2\u03c6 +m\n2\n1 \u2212 2E\u03c6E1\nB \u2261 2|P\u03c6||p1|\nM2\u03c6 +m\n2\n1 \u2212 2E\u03c6E1 \u2212m22\nC \u2261 4|P\u03c6||p1|\n4M2\u03c6 \u2212 4E\u03c6E1 \u2212 P\u03c6 \u00b7 P\u03c9\n. (10)\nii) With a monopole form factor, i.e. F(p22) = (\u039b2 \u2212 m22)\/(\u039b2 \u2212 p22), where \u039b is the cut-off energy, the integral\nbecomes:\nI = 4\u03c0(\u039b2 \u2212m22)\n[\n2 +\nD(A\u2212B)(C \u2212B)\nABC(B \u2212D) ln\n1\u2212B\n1 +B\n+\nB(A\u2212D)(C \u2212D)\nACD(B \u2212D) ln\n1\u2212D\n1 +D\n]\n, (11)\nwhere A, B, and C are the same as defined in (i), and\nD \u2261 2|P\u03c6||p1|\nM2\u03c6 +m\n2\n1 \u2212 2E\u03c6E1 \u2212 \u039b2\n.

Meanwhile, to test\nthe sensitivity of the results to the cut-off energies, we adopt \u039b = 0.7, 1.0 and 1.2 GeV as the lower and upper limit\nin the calculations.\nWith the above parameters, the intermediate meson exchanges of K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 and \u03c1\u03c1 are calculated as leading OZI\nviolation effects for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6. We first discuss these two processes separately, and then consider their interferences\nbased on the SU(3) relation.\nIn Table III, the branching ratios for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 are listed with the dipole form factor. It shows that the range\nof \u039b = 0.7 \u223c 1.2 GeV leads to about one order of magnitude changes to the predicted branching ratios. Although\nsome cautions have to be taken due to the sensitivity of the results to the cut-off energies, we also note that the\ncommonly adopted range of \u039b = 0.7 \u223c 1.2 GeV has been useful for providing the magnitude of contributions from the\nintermediate meson exchange processes. We find that the intermediate K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 rescattering has dominant contributions\nto the \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 transitions, while the \u03c1\u03c1 rescattering is more than an order of magnitude smaller. In particular, the\npredicted upper limit for the branching ratio \u03b7c \u2192 K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 is in good agreement with the experimental upper\nlimit [1].\nAs shown by the results with bothK\u2217K\u00af\u2217 and \u03c1\u03c1 contributing, the interference leads to about 2\/3 enhancement to the\nbranching ratio with the exclusiveK\u2217K\u00af\u2217 rescattering for \u039b = 1.2 GeV. With smaller cut-off energies, the enhancement\nbecomes more significant, but generally does not change the order of magnitudes. This is an indication that for the\npurpose of understanding the possible non-vanishing \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 decay, the estimate of the K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 contributions is nearly\nsufficient. Certainly, more rigorous study of the intermediate meson exchange contributions including more meson\nloops should be carried out with future improved experimental data.\nIn light of the improved branching ratios for \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c1\u03c1, K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 and \u03c6\u03c6, and upper limits for \u03c9\u03c9 and \u03c9\u03c6 from BES\ncollaboration, we investigate the implication of OZI violations in the decays of \u03b7c \u2192 V V based on a factorization\nscheme recently developed [13, 16]. It shows that sizeable OZI violations can occur under the present experimental\naccuracy. The process of \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 thus would be a unique test of such effects, and we find the branching ratio is at\norder of 10\u22124.\nWe then apply an intermediate meson exchange model to investigate the OZI violation mechanism in \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6.\nSimilar to what was found in J\/\u03c8 \u2192 V f0 decays [11], we find that the intermediate K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 rescattering can contribute\nto \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 with non-negligible magnitudes of about 10\u22124. In contrast, the contribution from the exclusive interme-\ndiate \u03c1\u03c1 rescattering is relatively small. But we find that its interference with the K\u2217K\u00af\u2217 can produce sizeable effects.\nAlthough the outputs of the intermediate meson exchange model still bear uncertainties due to its model-dependent\nfeature, we find that its agreement with the factorization scheme is very impressive. In another word, the intermediate\nmeson exchange could be a dynamic mechanism which leads to the OZI-rule violations in those low-lying charmonium\ndecays [11]. Nevertheless, the factorization scheme highlights interesting features arising from the \u03b7c decays, such as\nthe correlations between the OZI rule violations and SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking. Further experiments at BES\nconcentrating on \u03b7c \u2192 \u03c9\u03c6 should be able to disentangle this long-standing question.\nThe author wishes to thank F.E. Close and B.S.
