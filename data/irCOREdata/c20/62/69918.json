The 13 soils were subjected to simulated \nrainfall in laboratory experiments. Rainfall was applied to a soil flume (0.5 \u00d7 0.25 m) for 30 min \nat intensity of 60 mm h\u22121, and all overland flow generated during this period was collected. Two \nsimulations were performed 5 d apart. The soils generated a wide range of overland flow (13.3\u2013\n26.9 mm) and sediment (1.1\u201316.9 g). The sediments from the experiments were enriched with \nmedium silt particles (6\u201320 \u00b5m). Except for one soil in the second simulation, all of the study soils \nproduced overland flow sediments (OFS) that were enriched with P (TP 976\u20133884 mg kg\u22121, P \nenrichment ratio 0.92\u20134.42). Sediment TP was positively correlated (P <  0.05) with the sediment \nclay contents for both simulation events, and sediment total P enrichment was negatively \ncorrelated with soil TP. Attempts to reconstruct the TP content of sediments from TP analysis of \nthe soil particle size fractions yielded significant (P <  0.05) relationships between reconstructed \nand measured TP values. However, the reconstructed TP values were consistently lower than the \nmeasured sediment TP contents, indicating that further improvements to measurement \ntechniques are required if physically based modeling of P transport in overland flow is to be \nsuccessful at small scales. \nAbbreviations: ESR, exchangeable sodium ratio; MUSLE, Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation; \nOFS, overland flow sediments; P, phosphorus; SWAT, Soil and Water Assessment Tool; TP, total \nphosphorus. \nPHOSPHORUS and sediment play a major role in reducing the quality of freshwater. \nPhosphorus is a key element in controlling eutrophication (European Environment \nAgency, 1999), and in recent years there have been costly reductions in point source P \nloads from wastewater treatment works, with the aim of improving water quality \n(Withers et al., 2000). Sediment in waters leads to low light penetration and the \nsiltation of salmonid spawning grounds and is important for transporting contaminants \n(Quinton and Catt, 2007). While efforts to reduce the losses of P and sediment from \nsoils to waters have been underway for a number of years, recent reviews of the \ncontribution of agriculture to the pollution of United Kingdom and European rivers \nsuggest that it is contributing approximately one-third of all P (de Wit et al., 2002; \nWhite and Hammond, 2006). By contrast, in the United States, Carpenter et al. (1998) \nestimated that 84% of all P discharged to surface waters is from nonpoint sources. \nThe recognition of sediment and P as major contributors to water quality has led \nto the development of a number of water quality models with the objective of \npredicting the transport of P from soils to waters. Such models include Opus (Smith, \n1992) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT; Chaubey et al., 2006). These \nmodels have relied on semi-empirical relationships to describe P loss. Soil and Water \nAssessment Tool uses the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) model \n(Williams et al., 1984) to produce sediment yield, which is then converted to a P loss \nby using a relationship between sediment concentration and enrichment ratio from \nMenzel (1980). Opus uses a more physically based approach to sediment generation \nand the interaction between sediment and P, but it still relies on an enrichment ratio to \ncalculate the P loading. \nEnrichment ratios for sediment and P are therefore critical to the prediction of \npollutant transport; however, they are dependent on a number of processes which are \ninteracting across time and space. At a landscape scale, these processes are likely to \nbe occurring simultaneously, and different processes will dominate depending on the \nlandscape position and the antecedent condition at that point in the landscape. In \noverland flow, sediment and particulate P can be mobilized by rain splash \ndetachment, flow detachment, or dispersion. Particles are transported by rain splash \nand overland flow. Travel distances are typically in the order of centimeters for \nsplashed particles (Poesen, 1985). In overland flow, particle transport is dependent on \nthe particle settling velocity and the hydraulic properties of the flow, but, in general, \nsmall particles travel farther than large ones. Dissolved P is mobilized by direct loss \nof the soil solution or by desorption from sediment (including organic matter) or soil \nsurfaces. Note that it is quite possible for sediment to adsorb P from the solution \nduring transport in overland flow (McDowell et al., 2001). \nThere is disagreement in the literature regarding the specific size of soil particles \nthat are preferentially detached by rain splash and transported by overland flow. \nGabriels and Moldenhauer (1978) found that, at equilibrium, rain-splashed sediments \nwere not different from their parent soils. Other studies have reported that particles \n<53 \u03bcm (Ghadiri and Rose, 1991), <63 \u03bcm (Sutherland et al., 1996), <105 \u03bcm \n(Ellison, 1944), and between 110 and 1450 \u03bcm (Farmer, 1973) were preferentially \ndetached by rain splash. Rainfall characteristics and soil type are both likely to affect \nthe selectivity of rain splash and overland flow, and the variation between these \nstudies probably results from differences in experimental conditions such as soil type, \nraindrop size, rainfall intensity, and kinetic energy. Detachment by dispersion is a \nprocess that has been overlooked in the soil erosion literature. It is affected by a \nnumber of soil properties such as texture, mineralogy (Levy et al., 1993), \nexchangeable sodium ratio (ESR; Levy et al., 1993; Shainberg et al., 1992), and \nsurface charge of soil particles (Lima et al., 2000) and is particularly high in soils rich \nin clay, with high ESR, and particles saturated with anions, such as phosphate. Thus, \nparticles released to overland flow by this mechanism are likely to be in the colloidal \nfraction. \nGiven that fine particles have a large specific surface area and capacity to absorb \nP (Wild, 1988), P enrichment of eroded sediments is often a consequence when \nparticles are selectively detached and transported. As is the case for splash-detached \nsediment, there is a wide range of enrichment ratios reported for flow-transported P. \nSharpley (1985) measured the enrichment of TP in OFS from six soils using small soil \nflumes (similar to those used in this study). He reported enrichment ratios for TP of \n1.3 to 1.7, which were significantly positively correlated with the clay enrichment \nratios of 1.3 to 1.9. Other researchers have found P enrichment ratios from zero to \nvalues greater than six (Massey and Jackson, 1952; Sharpley, 1980; Sharpley, 1985). \nThis variability is likely to be a function of a number of parameters. There has been \nlimited work on this outside of Sharpley\u2019s (1980) simulated rainfall study, which \nconcluded that the fundamental soil physical and chemical properties of five soils had \nlittle effect on the enrichment ratios of P and that energy of rainfall and overland flow \nand soil P status were more important in influencing P enrichment. In this paper, we \ntest this finding by examining the variability in P detachment and transport by splash \nand shallow rain-impacted flow from a wide range of soils and consider the empirical \nsupport for a more process-based alternative to current P modeling approaches. \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nStudy Soils \nSoils with contrasting physicochemical properties and management histories were \ncollected from 13 arable sites in five European countries (Table 1); these represent a \nsubset of the soils described in Withers et al. (2007). The soils represented five \ntextural groups classified by the USDA system. In management terms, the soils had \nreceived a variety of P fertilization. The soils were collected from 0 to 10-cm depths \nand air-dried before being passed through a 5-mm sieve. \nRainfall Simulations \nSmall flume experiments were undertaken to determine the detachment and \ntransport of sediment and P from the 13 study soils. The flumes allowed good control \nof the initial conditions, with the objective of removing variability caused by factors \nother than those influenced by soil properties. As the study was focused on \nunderstanding process rather than soil management, this was considered to be a \nreasonable approach. Three replicated small soil flumes were prepared for each soil. \nAliquots of the air-dried, sieved soils were packed into metal trays (0.5 \u00d7 0.25 \u00d7 0.085 \nm; Fig. 1) to a bulk density of 1.3 g cm\u22123. The trays had perforated bases to allow \ndrainage and were fitted with an outlet tube at one end, at the height of the soil \nsurface, to allow the collection of overland flow. Once the trays were packed, the soil \nwas wetted by capillary rise for 24 h and allowed to drain for a further 24 h before \nrainfall was applied. Before and after each rainfall event, moisture content was \nmeasured at three random points in the soil, using a theta probe (Delta-T devices, \nCambridge, UK). \nA 9-m gravity-fed rainfall simulator was used to produce rainfall. To ensure the \nwater chemistry was consistent throughout the series of experiments, deionized water \nwas fed through the simulator. Raindrops were formed as water passed through \nhypodermic needles embedded in a tray 9 m above the soil surface. The falling \nraindrops passed through a mesh screen that produced a random drop size distribution. \nThe median drop size of the rainfall was 1.03 mm. The soil trays were placed under \nthe rainfall on a 5\u00b0 slope and rainfall was applied at 60 mm h\u22121 for 30 min. Overland \nflow was collected for three periods: 0 to 10, 10 to 20, and 20 to 30 min after rainfall \nbegan. For each time period, the volume of overland flow was measured and a \nsubsample taken for gravimetric determination of the sediment concentration \n(Bartram and Ballance, 1996). After the initial rainfall event (Event 1), the soil trays \nwere left for 5 d and the simulated rainfall experiment was repeated (Event 2). \nPhosphorus Analyses \nSoil TP was determined by inductively coupled plasma\u2013optical emission \nspectroscopy (ICP\u2013OES) after digestion with concentrated sulfuric and perchloric \nacid (Sparks et al., 1996). \nThe overland flow samples were stored at 5\u00b0C in polyethylene bottles that had \npreviously been rinsed in 5% HCl and deionized water. First, each sample was \ndigested using sulfuric acid-persulfate digestion adapted from Eisenreich et al. (1975) \nand described by Rowland and Haygarth (1997). The concentration of TP was \ndetermined colormetrically using the method of Murphy and Riley (1962). Samples \nwere analyzed as soon as possible after collection and always within 14 d. Total load \nof TP produced during the 30 min rainfall event was calculated as the sum of the \nproduct of volume of overland flow TP concentration for each sampling interval of \nthe rainfall simulation experiments. The enrichment ratio (ER) for the OFS TP was \ndefined as the ratio of the OFS TP content to the original soil content. \nParticle Size Analyses \nTo collect sufficient overland flow sediment from rainfall simulation experiments \nfor particle size analysis, it was necessary to bulk together the sediment from the three \nreplicates. For each soil, 10 g of sieved (2 mm) soil was treated with 30% H2O2 to \ndestroy soil organic matter and then dispersed with Na4P207; these steps were not \nperformed for the OFS. Soil and sediment samples were passed through a 125 \u00b5m \nsieve before being analyzing for particle size with a Sedigraph 5100 (MicroMetrics, \nLondonderry, USA). For the Sedigraph analyses, 3 g of soil or sediment plus 75 mL \nof deionized water were left to stand overnight. One milliliter of sodium hydroxide \n0.01 mol L-1 was added as a dispersant and the samples were shaken for 1 h before \nbeing analyzed. Sodium hydroxide was used, rather than the more normal sodium \nhexametaphosphate dispersant, to avoid contaminating the sediment samples, needed \nfor TP analysis, with P. \nAnalysis of TP Content of Particle Size Fractions \nTo analyze the TP content of the silt and clay fractions, 5 g of soil was weighed \ninto 500 mL centrifuge bottles to which 500 mL of 1 mmol L-1 NaCl was added. The \nbottles were shaken in a horizontal shaker for 240 min at 160 rpm and then transferred \nto a measuring cylinder, which was inverted five times before placing on a firm \nbench. Aliquots of the <63 \u03bcm, <20 \u03bcm, and <6.3 \u03bcm fractions were collected after \nallowing the suspension to sediment for 1 min 20 sec, 12 min, and 2 h, respectively. \nThe suspensions were then centrifuged at 500 rpm for 6 h 45 min so that the <2 \u03bcm \nparticles were kept in suspension and aliquots were collected. For each of the \nsuspensions, suspended sediment concentration was determined gravimetrically \n(Bartram and Ballance, 1996). Total P was determined colormetrically, using the \nmethod of Murphy and Riley (1962), after digesting the dry residue with aqua-regia. \nTo ensure that the results from the aqua-regia method were comparable with those \nfrom the sulfuric acid-persulfate method, used for digesting the soils and OFS, the \nsamples in the <0.63 \u00b5m size range were digested using both methods and good \nagreement for TP (r = 0.98; P < 0.01) was found. We are therefore confident that the \nresults from the two digestion methods used in this study are comparable. Total P \ncontents of the fine, medium, and coarse silt fractions (2\u20136.3 \u03bcm, 6.3\u201320 \u03bcm, and 20\u2013\n63 \u03bcm) were found by subtracting the TP content of the smaller size fraction from the \nTP content of the larger size fraction (i.e., for the 2\u20136.3 \u03bcm size range the TP content \nof the <2 \u03bcm fraction was subtracted from the TP content of the <6.3 \u03bcm fraction). \nPhosphorus enrichment ratios were calculated as the ratio of the TP content of the size \nfraction to the TP content of the bulk soil. \nReconstruction of Sediment TP Concentration \nTotal P contents for the 20 to 63 \u03bcm, 6.3 to 20 \u03bcm, 2 to 6.3 \u03bcm, and <2 \u03bcm \nfractions of the 13 soils were determined using the TP concentration and respective \nsize fraction concentrations from the particle size fraction data. This was then \ncombined with the appropriate proportion of overland flow sediment in each particle \nsize fraction to give the TP content of each size fraction of the overland flow \nsediment. These values were then summed and compared to the TP content obtained \nfor the bulk overland flow sediment sample. \nStatistical Analyses \nAll statistical analyses were performed using Statistica (v. 6.0; StatSoft, Inc., \n1984\u20132003, Tulsa, USA). The results of the three time intervals were averaged to give \na single result for each 30-min rainfall event. The chi-square test was used to compare \nthe particle size distributions of soils and OFS. Analysis of variance was performed to \ncompare the TP contents of the soil and the OFS. \nRESULTS \nSoil Properties \nThe texture of the study soils ranged from silty clay (Turku) to a sandy loam \n(Gleadthorpe; Table 1). Ten of the soils had high silt contents (57\u201376%) and were \nclassified as either silt loam or loam; however, particle size analysis showed that the \ncontribution of coarse, medium, and fine silt to the total silt content varied widely \namong the soils (Table 1). \nTotal P Content of Particle Size Fractions \nApart from the Gleadthorpe soil, no P enrichment of the silt fraction was found for \nthe studied soils (Table 2), with the highest concentrations of TP located in the clay \nfraction. These ranged between 1428 and 4732 mg kg\u22121 and were between 1.21 and \n7.26 times that of the parent soil. Phosphorus concentrations in the silt fraction were \ntypically lower, ranging from 286 to 1688 mg kg\u22121, with P enrichment ratios ranging \nfrom 0.24 to 1.92. \nOverland Flow and Sediment Loss \nThe volume of overland flow produced from the 13 soils during the 30-min \nrainfall events varied significantly (P < 0.01). The total volume of overland flow \nproduced from the 13 soils during Events 1 and 2 (Table 3) was not significantly \ndifferent (P > 0.05), with means of 21.8 and 22.4 mm and a range of 13.6 and 10.8 \nmm, respectively. The total sediment load generated from the 13 soils varied \nsignificantly (P < 0.01); however, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) \nbetween the loads produced during Events 1 and 2. The total sediment load of \noverland flow generated from the 13 soils ranged from 1.7 and 1.1 g to 16.9 and 16 g \nin Event 1 and Event 2, respectively, with a mean of 4.4 g for Event 1 and 3.7 g for \nEvent 2. \nParticle Size Distribution of Soil and Overland Flow Sediment \nWith the exception of the soils from Turku and Tetto Frati in Event 1 and the soils \nfrom Bonavia, Ritzelhof 4, Sale, Turku, and Tetto Frati in Event 2, there were \nsignificant differences (P < 0.05) between the particle size distribution of the overland \nflow sediment and that of the original soil. For 12 of the study soils, no significant \ndifference was found between the particle size distribution of the OFS produced from \nEvents 1 and 2; however, the particle size distribution of the sediment eroded from the \nGleadthorpe soil was significantly different in Event 1 and Event 2 (P < 0.05), with \nhigher sand and lower fine silt content in the sediment eroded in Event 2. \nOverall, OFS generated during Events 1 and 2 tended to contain less sand than the \nsoil, but with no clear pattern for silt and clay contents (Fig. 2). The Gleadthorpe soil \nstands out due to the much larger amounts of silt and clay lost relative to the original \nsoil. Figure 3 allows us to look in more detail at the shifts in the enrichment of the silt \nfraction. It is apparent for both Events 1 and 2 that most soils behave in a similar way, \nwith the medium silt content increasing from the soil to the sediment at the expense of \nthe coarse silt, but with little change in the fine silt content of the sediment when \ncompared to the soil. \nEnrichment of Phosphorus in Overland Flow Sediments \nThe TP content of the OFS from the study soils ranged from 1027 to 2884 mg \nkg\u22121 (mean of 1700 mg kg\u22121) in Event 1, and from 976 to 3884 mg kg\u22121 (mean of \n1906 mg kg\u22121) in Event 2 (Table 3). For all of the study soils, there was no significant \ndifference (P > 0.05) between the TP content of the OFS from Events 1 and 2. There \nwas significantly higher TP in the OFS than in the original soil (P < 0.01). The ranges \nof TP contents in the OFS from the 13 soils were greater (1857 and 2908 mg kg\u22121 for \nEvent 1 and 2, respectively) than the range of TP contents in the original soil (1464 \nmg kg\u22121). There was no correlation between the TP content of OFS and the volume of \noverland flow or total sediment load of the rainfall event for the 13 soils. \nThere was no significant (P < 0.05) relationship between the TP content of the \noriginal soils and OFS (Table 3). However, sediment TP enrichment ratios increased \nas the soil TP content decreased (Event 1: r = 0.53, P < 0.05; Event 2: r = 0.64, P < \n0.05; Fig. 4a and b). The Turku soil had the highest TP content of the soils (1868 mg \nkg\u22121) and had one of the lowest enrichment ratios for TP in the OFS (1.1 and 1.24 for \nEvents 1 and 2, respectively), while the Keszthely soil had the lowest soil TP content \n(404 mg kg\u22121) and had one of the highest TP enrichment ratios in the OFS (3.16 and \n3.39 for Events 1 and 2, respectively). \nRelationship between Primary Particle and TP Enrichment in Overland Flow \nSediments \nTotal P enrichment was positively correlated with sediment clay content for both \nevents (Event 1: r = 0.63, P < 0.05; Event 2: r = 0.62, P < 0.05) and negatively \ncorrelated with the OFS fine sand content for Event 2 (r = -0.65, P < 0.05). The \nTurku, Bonavia, Ritzelhof 4, Sale, and Tetto Frati soils produced OFS that were not \nsignificantly different from the original soil in terms of particle size distribution, and \nthree of these soils (Turku, Bonavia, and Tetto Frati) had the lowest enrichment of TP, \nranging from 1.08 to 1.17 in Event 1 and from 0.92 to 1.29 in Event 2. Overland flow \nsediments from the Keszthely and Gleadthorpe soils had the highest TP enrichment \nratios (Event 1: 3.16 and 3.28, Event 2: 3.39 and 4.42, respectively) of the study soils \nand this was reflected in the enrichment of medium and fine silt fractions in these \nOFS, which for Gleadthorpe was higher than for any other soil in Event 1 (enrichment \nratios of 2.61 and 4.42 for medium and fine silt, respectively). However, enrichment \nof silt and clay fractions did not always result in P enrichment \u2014 the Villafranca \nPiemonte had the second highest enrichment of the fine silt fraction (3.96 and 2.76 in \nEvents 1 and 2, respectively) yet produced lower TP enrichment ratios (1.65 and 1.55 \nin Events 1 and 2, respectively). \nReconstruction of Overland Flow Sediment TP concentration \nThere was a significant (Event 1: r = 0.72, P < 0.01; Event 2: r = 0.77, P < 0.01) \nlinear relationship between the reconstructed values for the concentration of P in the \nOFS and the bulk sediment TP analysis (Fig. 5) for Events 1 and 2. However, the \nreconstructed TP contents were almost always lower than those determined for the \nbulk OFS. \nDISCUSSION \nParticle Size Distribution of Overland flow Sediments \nGiven the small scale of the experiments and the shallow (<5 mm) flow depths \ngenerated during the experiments, we would expect that the OFS would be dominated \nby fine particles with low settling velocities. Although our results do show enrichment \nof the sediment silt fraction, supporting those of Alberts et al. (1980), Ellison (1944), \nGhadiri and Rose (1991), Wan and El-Swaify (1997), they do not show enrichment \nacross all silt and clay sized material. The amount of particle enrichment also varies \nbetween soils and this is likely to be due to the way that aggregates from the different \nsoils fragment when struck by raindrops and the fate of these fragments as they are \ntransported in overland flow. \nRaindrops impacting on a soil surface may fragment aggregates and dislodge \nprimary particles, either by physical detachment or physio-chemical dispersion. Both \nsets of particles may be entrained by overland flow and the aggregate fragments may \nbe fragmented further during transportation, by rolling or saltating along the soil \nsurface, colliding with other aggregates in the flow, or by being struck by additional \nraindrops. It is therefore likely that what we are measuring is the particle size \ndistribution of a mix of aggregates and primary particles. We can hypothesize that in \nsoils such as Turku, for which the OFS was similar in composition to the parent, the \nprimary mechanism for particle transport was as discrete aggregates \u2014 the aggregates \nwere detached from the soil surface, but did not break down to primary particles \nduring transport, and were not, therefore, exposed to selective transport mechanisms, \nsuch as those described by Hairsine and Rose (1992). Unstable soils, such as \nGleadthorpe, where the OFS had a very different composition to the soil, are likely to \nhave been broken down to primary particles, which were then subjected to selective \ntransport by the shallow rain-impacted overland flow generated in these experiments, \nresulting in a much finer overland flow sediment than the parent soil. For many of the \nsoils which were not at these two extremes, it is likely that there was a mix of \naggregate and primary particle transport. \nThe hypothesis that there is a combination of aggregate and particle transport \noperating in parallel is further corroborated if we consider that the clay fraction was \nonly enriched in the OFS from five of the soils. This result is surprising when the \nfindings of previous research are considered. Clay enrichment of OFS has been \nreported in studies at a range of scales (Alberts et al., 1980; Quinton et al., 2001; \nSharpley, 1985). Clay enrichment occurs because, once in suspension, clay particles \ncan be transported longer distances downslope than coarser particles by low energy \nflow (Alberts et al., 1980; Gabriels and Moldenhauer, 1978). Gabriels and \nMoldenhauer (1978) reported that the amount of clay in rain-splashed sediments was \ntwo to four times lower than in OFS. In the present study, the cohesiveness of clay \nparticles may have prevented their detachment by rain splash, limiting the clay \nparticles available for transport by overland flow to those that were transported \nincorporated within aggregates. \nPhosphorus Enrichment of Overland Flow Sediments \nOverland flow sediments from all but one of the study soils were enriched with TP \nwhen compared with the soil from which they were derived. Numerous other \nresearchers have reported P enrichment of OFS in erosion experiments at a range of \nscales (Kronvang, 1990; Massey and Jackson, 1952; Quinton et al., 2001; Sharpley, \n1985; Sholtenberg and While, 1953). The extent to which OFS were enriched with TP \nvaried between soils, and, as expected, the TP content of the OFS was not correlated \nto the TP content of the soils. Previous research has shown that TP enrichment of OFS \ndecreases as the amount of erosion increases (Quinton et al., 2001; Sharpley, 1980; \nSharpley, 1985). No such relationship was found when the TP content of OFS was \ncompared to the total sediment load for the 13 study soils, probably because the effect \nof soil type on the TP content of OFS was more dominant. \nOur results corroborate the findings of Quinton et al. (2001), Sharpley, (1980), \nand Sharpley (1985) that the presence of P-rich clay particles contributes to the P \nenrichment of OFS, although \u2014 as Sharpley (1985) concluded from indoor rainfall \nsimulator experiments \u2014 clay enrichment alone could not fully explain the P \nenrichment of OFS. It is likely that organic P would have been an important \nconstituent of our OFS, as organic P contents accounted for 9 to 25% of the soil TP \n(H. Hartikainen, personal communication, 2008). Some of the P containing organic \nmatter is likely to have been associated with the colloidal fraction (Lagaly, 1984) and \nto have been included in determination of the sediment\u2019s clay fraction. However, the \ncontribution to the TP content of the OFS by other more buoyant material has not \nbeen accounted for and might have helped to explain more fully the P enrichment of \nthe OFS. \nReconstruction of Overland Flow Sediment TP Concentration \nThe consistent underestimation of the OFS TP concentration using the TP \nconcentrations of the particle size fractions is not surprising. We lacked TP values for \nthe sand fraction, and although TP concentrations in the sand fraction are likely to be \nsmaller that the silt and clay fractions their TP content can still be significant (e.g., \nMaguire et al., 1998). Organic P may also be underrepresented in our analysis: \nalthough we analyzed for Total P, which will have included most organic material, it \nis possible that some buoyant organic matter might have been missed during the \nparticle size separation. It is also possible that the <2\u00b5m size fraction is not strictly \ncomparable for the size separation and OFS particle size analysis. Although both \nprocedures were based on sedimentation, using NaOH as a dispersant, the size \nseparation relied on centrifugation followed by pipette sampling to obtain the <2 \u00b5m \nfraction, compared to sedimentation and in situ analysis used by the sedigraph. As the \nhighest concentrations of TP reside in the clay fraction, small discrepancies between \nthe methods may lead to relatively larger differences in TP content. \nThese findings have important implications for those developing size selective \nmodels of P mobilization and transfer. Particle size selective models of erosion \nprocesses have been introduced at the depositional stage of erosion models (Hairsine \nand Rose, 1992; Smith, 1992; Smith et al., 1995; Charpin and Myers, 2005). Smith \n(1992) also incorporated P concentrations in the predictions made by Opus, and \nCharpin and Myers (2005) included the potential for selective detachment and \ntransport into their model of selective transport in overland flow. Although these \nmodels provide conceptually advanced descriptions of selective erosion processes, \ntheir ability to predict the transport of P associated with soil particles is limited by our \nability to describe the soil environment. Even at this scale, where we had good control \nover our experiments, we could not reconstruct the TP content of the OFS from the P \nconcentration by particle size distribution with complete confidence. This implies that \nwe cannot accurately measure the parameters that our model process descriptions \ndemand \u2014 in this case the P distribution by particle size \u2014 or that we have missed \nsomething in our process description and we are therefore not measuring it (e.g., \norganic forms of P) or that we are not capturing the natural variation of soil properties \nwith our measurements. Simulation results from such models are therefore likely to be \nin error until we can improve our measurement techniques. \nCONCLUSIONS \nOur study confirms that soil type plays a major role in determining the size of \nparticles that are preferentially detached and transported by rain splash and overland \nflow. Medium silt particles (6\u201320 \u00b5m) were enriched more than other size fractions. \nWhile this is partly a function of a lower settling velocity than larger silt and sand \nparticles, we believe that at this scale it is also due to the cohesive nature of particles \n<2 \u00b5m, which resisted detachment and were transported primarily as aggregates. \nThe enrichment of TP in OFS occurred from a wide range of soils. The selective \ntransport of fine particles (<20 \u00b5m) appears to be the primary cause. By using the TP \ncontent of different particle sizes it was possible to reconstruct the TP content of the \nOFS, with a limited degree of confidence, suggesting that if measurement methods \ncan be improved, process-based descriptions of selective erosion processes have the \npotential to predict P transfer in overland flow at a small scale. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis work was funded by the European Union (EVK1-CT-1999-00007).
