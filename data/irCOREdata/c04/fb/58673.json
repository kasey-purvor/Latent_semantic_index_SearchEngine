In this study simulated upland 18 \ngrassland communities containing seven species were exposed to ozone treatments in 19 \nsolardomes for 12 weeks in each of two consecutive summers.  Ozone profiles, based 20 \non future ozone predictions, were of elevated background concentrations, episodic 21 \npeaks of ozone and a combination of the two.  During the winter between the two 22 \nexposures the communities were kept outdoors in ambient air.  Whereas previous 23 \nstudies have demonstrated that peaks of ozone cause detrimental effects to vegetation, 24 \nthis study shows that for simulated grassland communities an increase in background 25 \nozone concentration in the absence of peaks of ozone also corresponded with 26 \nincreased senescence.  In many cases senescence was further increased when peaks of 27 \nozone were also present.  The species used showed no acclimation to ozone and the 28 \nsame relationship between senescence and ozone dose occurred in both years of the 29 \nstudy.  A decrease in cumulative biomass was demonstrated for Anthoxanthum 30 \nodoratum, which contributed to a decrease in total community biomass.  These results 31 \nindicate that current and future ozone concentrations could cause detrimental effects 32 \non growth and vitality of natural grassland communities and that for some species the 33 \nconsequences of increased background ozone concentration are as severe as that of 34 \nincreased peaks. 35 \n 36 \nKey words 37 \nGrassland; ozone profiles; senescence; biomass; competition 38 \n1. Introduction 39 \nTropospheric ozone concentrations have been increasing during the last century due to 40 \nincreasing anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors (Volz and Kley, 1988).  In 41 \nurban and lowland areas elevated ozone occurs as ozone episodes, where ozone 42 \nconcentrations are increased for several days in a pronounced diurnal profile, with the 43 \nhighest peak during the day and low concentrations at night (Garland and Derwent, 44 \n1979).  In contrast, at remote, high-altitude sites ozone concentrations remain high at 45 \nnight-time, because the air remains turbulent and losses of ozone from the lowest air 46 \nlayers due to dry deposition are replaced from ozone-rich layers above (Coyle et al., 47 \n2002; Ashmore et al., 2002).  In the last 15 years, there has been evidence of a change 48 \nin the ozone profile over Europe.  Peak concentrations have fallen (Vingarzan, 2004; 49 \nSzopa et al., 2006) whilst background ozone concentrations have steadily increased 50 \n(Solberg et al., 2005, Derwent et al., 2006).  Current predictions indicate that the 51 \nrising background may stabilise by ca. 2030, but peak ozone concentrations may 52 \nagain rise as global warming increases the incidence of climatic conditions conducive 53 \nto ozone formation (Royal Society, 2008). In this study, we investigated the 54 \nimplications of the potential changes in ozone profile for an upland grassland since 55 \nthe effects are likely to be felt first in remote upland regions (Coyle et al., 2003).  For 56 \nthese communities the diurnal cycles are less pronounced and the background ozone 57 \nconcentration is already in the 30 to 40+ ppb range in many such areas of Europe (e.g. 58 \nMarchlyn Mawr, UK, altitude 610 m, www.welshairquality.co.uk, grid reference 59 \nSH604627).   60 \n 61 \nOzone has been shown to cause adverse effects on individual plant species, with 62 \neffects including visible injury and premature senescence (e.g. Bergmann et al., 1995) 63 \nand effects on growth (e.g. Franzaring et al., 2000; Gimeno et al., 2004a).  Different 64 \neffects have been reported on different species and a wide range in sensitivity to 65 \nozone has been observed (Hayes et al., 2006).  In addition to these experimental 66 \nstudies, effects of ozone on naturally occurring plants in ambient air have been 67 \ndemonstrated across Europe (Hayes et al. 2007a).  However, few studies have 68 \ninvestigated the effects of ozone at mean levels of 30 - 50 ppb without including some 69 \npeak exposures and this has been identified as a large gap in current knowledge that 70 \nmakes it very difficult to predict the impact of changes in the background ozone 71 \nconcentration on vegetation (Coyle et al., 2003).  One of the few studies to investigate 72 \nthe effects of elevated background ozone concentrations demonstrated that for the 73 \ngrass species Anthoxanthum odoratum, elevated background ozone concentrations 74 \ninduced premature senescence to a similar extent to episodic peaks superimposed on a 75 \nlow background (Dawnay and Mills, 2009).   76 \n 77 \nIt is possible that changes in community dynamics could occur with increased ozone 78 \nexposure due to the differential responses to ozone of the component species, 79 \nhowever, there have been comparatively few studies on the effects of ozone on plant 80 \ncommunities.  Studies to date have been almost exclusively on grassland\/pasture 81 \nvegetation.  The majority of these studies carried out using two or three species 82 \nmixtures (e.g. Bender et al., 2002, 2006; Gimeno et al., 2004b; Tonneijck et al., 83 \n2004), and a few additional studies used larger model communities or established 84 \nvegetation (e.g. Ashmore and Ainsworth, 1995; R\u00e4m\u00f6 et al., 2006; Volk et al., 2006).  85 \nThe studies have shown that some species respond differently to ozone depending on 86 \nwhich species they are growing in competition with, for example Poa pratensis 87 \nshowed reduced growth with ozone exposure when growing with Veronica 88 \nchamaedrys, but not when grown with other species such as Achillea millefolium 89 \n(Bender et al., 2006).  Elevated ozone has also been shown to have carry-over effects 90 \nthe following spring in species that did not respond to summer ozone exposure (Hayes 91 \net al., 2006). Longer-term studies involving field release of ozone in Switzerland have 92 \nindicated that effects on biomass can take some time to manifest. For a species-rich 93 \nhay pasture grassland, no effects were found in the first year of exposure, but after 5 94 \nyears of exposure there was a significant decrease in total yield and the percentage of 95 \nlegumes (Volk et al., 2006) with effects being cumulative with time.  In a similar 96 \nongoing study for sub-alpine pasture, no effects on biomass of the component species 97 \nwas evident after three years (Bassin et al., 2007b), but some species had a reduced 98 \nchlorophyll content associated with yellowing (Bassin et al., 2009).    99 \n 100 \nDespite the evidence for a changing ozone profile, with the exception of Dawnay and 101 \nMills (2009), conducted in our laboratory, very few studies have investigated the 102 \nrelative effects of increasing peak versus increasing background ozone concentration.   103 \nOksanen and Holopainen (2001) exposed saplings of birch to three ozone profiles 104 \nwith the same AOT40 (the sum of the differences between the hourly mean ozone 105 \nconcentration (in ppb) and 40 ppb for each hour when the concentration exceeds 40 106 \nppb) presented at 70 ppb for 24h d\n-1\n, 100 ppb for 12h d\n-1\n or 200 ppb for 4.5 h d\n-1\n.  It 107 \nwas found that high peak ozone concentration was important for visible injury and 108 \nreductions in stomatal conductance whilst growth reductions were more related to 109 \ntotal accumulated exposure.  Exposure of mixtures of Lolium perenne and Trifolium 110 \nrepens also indicated that clover yield was similar with an episodic profile compared 111 \nto a fairly constant ozone exposure with a similar AOT40 (Nussbaum et al., 1995), 112 \nalthough in this case the total forage yield was affected more by the episodic 113 \ntreatment.  More recently, Wang et al. (2008) reported that ozone with a diurnal 114 \nprofile but the same overall mean concentration and accumulated dose as constant 115 \nozone exposure had a greater negative effect on the growth and yield of oilseed rape.   116 \nHeath et al., 2009, reviewed evidence of the temporal responses to ozone and 117 \nprovided some clues as to why different processes in plants respond differently to 118 \ndifferent ozone profiles.   He found that the time of maximum anti-oxidant defence 119 \nwithin plants was early-mid morning, well before the mid-afternoon peak ozone 120 \nconcentration associated with a rural profile and suggested that due to higher 121 \nantioxidant activity morning ozone fluxes were less biologically effective than 122 \nafternoon fluxes.   Heath et al (2009) re-iterated the importance of nocturnal fluxes 123 \n(see Musselman et al., 2000 for further details), and stressed the need for further 124 \nresearch into long-term effects of ambient exposures. 125 \n 126 \nUsing species from a typical upland grassland (National Vegetation Classification 127 \n(NVC) U4 community (Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland, 128 \nRodwell, 1992) growing together as a simulated community, this study investigated 129 \nthe effects of increasing background ozone (by 20 \u2013 27 ppb) and added peaks (by 50 130 \nppb), singly and in combination over two consecutive summer exposures.   The aim 131 \nwas to determine the relative importance of these simulated current and future 132 \nambient ozone concentrations on the development of senescence, above ground 133 \nbiomass and competitiveness of the component species and functional groups.  The 134 \nmodel communities were maintained in shallow containers to simulate a below-135 \nground competitive environment typical of upland grasslands.  136 \n 137 \n2. Methods 138 \nPlant communities 139 \nPlants of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Carex echinata, Carex bigelowii, Potentilla erecta 140 \nand Galium saxatile were propagated from stock plants that originated from 141 \nSnowdonia, UK (grid reference SH646606), an area dominated by Festuca ovina-142 \nAgrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland (NVC U4, Rodwell, 1992).  Seeds of 143 \nFestuca ovina and Agrostis capillaris were sown into cell trays from seed obtained 144 \nfrom a commercial seed supplier with seed originating from the UK (Emorsgate, UK).   145 \n 146 \nStraight-sided containers (27cm diameter, 11cm deep; LBS horticulture) were lined 147 \nwith perforated plastic to discourage root growth through the drainage holes and filled 148 \nwith a mixture of ericaceous compost and sharp sand (in a ratio of 40 litres to 25 kg).  149 \nEach pot was planted with A. capillaris (2 plants), A. odoratum (2 plants), F. ovina (2 150 \nplants), C. echinata (1 plant), C. bigelowii (1 plant), P. erecta (1 plant) and G. saxatile 151 \n(1 plant) to create a model plant community.  Each pot had the same arrangement of 152 \nspecies, with plants of the lower growing species P. erecta and G. saxatile in the 153 \ncentre of the pot and the other species around the pot edge.  The communities were 154 \nestablished in a cool greenhouse (approximately 18\u00b0C) for 8 weeks, by which time the 155 \nplants had grown together to form a closed canopy.  During this time the systemic 156 \npesticide imidachloprid (Provado) was applied as a soil drench.  Immediately prior to 157 \nthe first exposure to ozone in the solardomes the vegetation was cut back to 11cm and 158 \nall leaves growing outside the pot perimeter were also removed.   159 \n 160 \nCommunities were categorised according to the size of the component species at the 161 \nend of the establishment phase.  One community of the eight in each size category 162 \nwas randomly allocated to each solardome.  Five communities were exposed to ozone 163 \nin each solardome.  Each community was moved within the solardome every two 164 \nweeks in year 1 and every three weeks in year 2 to avoid any potential confounding 165 \neffect of location.   166 \nOver-wintering 167 \nFollowing the first period of ozone exposure, the communities were left to over-168 \nwinter in sheltered but outdoor conditions.  A weak nutrient solution was applied 169 \nevery eight weeks over the winter period (half-strength \u201cPhosphrogen\u201d, PBI Home 170 \nand Garden).  After cutting back the vegetation in June, the communities were 171 \ntransferred to the solardomes on 4\nth\n July to acclimatise before ozone treatments started 172 \non 8\nth\n July 2005.   173 \n 174 \nThroughout both periods of ozone exposure the model communities were watered 175 \nduring the early morning (4 am) using an automated misting system, with additional 176 \nhand-watering applied as necessary during periods of hot weather.   177 \nOzone exposure 178 \nEight solardomes (large, hemispherical glasshouses, 3m diameter, 2.1m high) were 179 \nused for ozone exposure.  Ozone was generated by a G11 ozone generator (Dryden 180 \nAqua, UK) using oxygen supplied by a Workhorse 8  oxygen generator (Dryden 181 \nAqua, UK) and added to charcoal filtered air to give the required ozone 182 \nconcentrations using a computer controlled (LabView version 6.0) mass-flow 183 \ncontroller system.  The ozone concentration in each solardome was recorded every 30 184 \nminutes using two photometric ozone analysers of matched calibration 185 \n(Environmental Technology Services 400A).  The first ozone exposure started on 14\nth\n 186 \nJuly 2004 and the second exposure started on 8\nth\n July 2005.  Each exposure period 187 \nwas for 12 weeks.   188 \n 189 \nOzone treatment was allocated to each solardome in a randomised block arrangement, 190 \nwith two blocks of four solardomes.  An individual solardome received the same 191 \ntreatment in both years.  The treatments applied and abbreviations for these treatments 192 \nwere: 193 \nLL: Low background (15 ppb), low peaks (20 ppb) 194 \nLH: Low background (15 ppb), high peaks (65 ppb) 195 \nHL: High background (35 ppb), low peaks (40 ppb) 196 \nHH: High background (35 ppb), high peaks (85 ppb) 197 \n 198 \n\u201ePeaks\u201f of ozone were applied for eight hours per day, automated to start to increase 199 \nat 09:00, reaching a peak at 11:00, then decreasing over 2 hours starting at 18:00.  200 \nThese peaks were applied for four consecutive days in each 7-day period.  The 201 \nconcentrations indicated for these peaks are the maximum target ozone concentration 202 \nduring the peak.  The ozone concentrations remained at the appropriate \u201ebackground\u201f 203 \nlevels for the treatment at all other times.   204 \n 205 \nThe mean ozone concentration during the establishment of the communities was 24.8 206 \nppb, with an AOT40 over the establishment period of approximately 80 ppb.h.  Ozone 207 \nconcentrations of the ambient air were not measured on site throughout the 208 \noverwintering period, but started on 8\nth\n July in 2005 (year 2), however, the AOT40 209 \nprior to 8\nth\n July was negligible, based on measurements from a nearby monitoring 210 \nstation. 211 \nSimulated meadow cuts and final harvest 212 \nThe plant canopies were cut back to 7 cm to simulate meadow cuts at the end of the 213 \nozone exposure period in Year 1, after over-wintering and early season growth (June 214 \n2005), and to soil level after exposure to ozone in Year 2.  The above-ground 215 \nvegetation was separated into the component species prior to drying at 65\u00b0C.  Below-216 \nground biomass was not determined.  Due to a system fault in one of the replicate 217 \nsolardomes for the \u201eHH\u201f treatment on 25th August (week six), plants from this dome 218 \nwere discarded in Year 1.  The five original communities and five spare communities 219 \n(which had received the same ozone treatment) from the replicate dome were 220 \nrandomly allocated between the two HH treatments for the exposure in Year 2.  221 \nVisible injury and senescence assessments 222 \nCommunities were checked weekly for ozone injury.  The percentage of ozone-223 \ninjured leaves and senesced leaves (a leaf was classified as senesced if >25% of the 224 \nleaf was senesced) per species per pot was recorded fortnightly in Year 1 and three-225 \nweekly in Year 2. 226 \nStatistical analysis 227 \nAll senescence data were arcsine transformed prior to analysis.  Data from the 228 \ndiscarded plants from the HH treatment in year 1 were included in this assessment for 229 \nthe weeks 0-6 (prior to system fault); after this in year 1, for weeks 7-12, data from 230 \nthe additional pots in the replicate solardome were used. Senescence at harvest and 231 \nbiomass were separately analysed using two-way analysis of variance in GenStat 232 \n(Version 8) using the mean value per solardome.  Data was analysed to investigate 233 \nwhether \u201ebackground\u201f, \u201epeak\u201f or an interaction between \u201ebackground\u201f and \u201epeak\u201f 234 \nozone concentrations influenced plant response.  Differences in the rates of 235 \nprogression of senescence between treatments were assessed for each species using a 236 \nRepeated Measures test in SPSS (Version 12), based on the mean per replicate 237 \nsolardome at each assessment.  Comparison of the development of senescence 238 \nbetween Year 1 and Year 2 was made using the general linear model function within 239 \nMinitab Version 14, using AOT0 and AOT40 as the ozone parameter.    240 \n3. Results 241 \nOzone exposure 242 \nFigure 1 illustrates the mean weekly profile in the solardomes in years 1 and 2. In 243 \nboth years, the difference in mean concentration between the two replicate solardomes 244 \nfor each treatment was < 2 ppb.  Ozone concentrations in all treatments were reduced 245 \nto 10-20 ppb on day 7 allowing access for plant measurements.  In year 1 mean 246 \nbackground ozone concentrations were 20.3 ppb in both the LL and LH treatments 247 \nand 48.7 ppb and 47.6 ppb in the HL and HH treatments respectively, with mean peak 248 \nheights of an additional 2.9 ppb for the low peaks, and 49.8 ppb for the high peaks 249 \ntreatments.  In year 2, the mean background ozone concentrations were 17.2 ppb and 250 \n18.1 ppb in the LL and LH treatments and 37.1 ppb and 39.8 ppb in the HL and HH 251 \ntreatments respectively, with mean peak heights of an additional 5.8 ppb for the low 252 \npeaks and 52.3 ppb for high peaks treatments.  The mean ozone concentrations for the 253 \nbackground and peaks for each treatment, and the AOT0 (the sum of the differences 254 \nbetween the hourly mean ozone concentration (in ppb) and 0 ppb for each hour when 255 \nthe concentration exceeds 0 ppb) and AOT40 in each year of the study are shown in 256 \nTable 1.  There was good replication between the solardomes for each treatment in 257 \neach year (Figure 1), however, the ozone concentrations were generally lower in year 258 \n2 than in year 1, particularly the background ozone concentrations for the \u201eHL\u201f and 259 \n\u201eHH\u201f ozone treatments.   260 \nOzone-specific visible injury 261 \nNo ozone-specific visible injury was observed on any of the component species in any 262 \ntreatment during either of the twelve-week exposures of the communities to ozone. 263 \nSenescence 264 \nAt harvest in year 1, P. erecta, C. echinata and F. ovina showed increased senescence 265 \nin response to increasing background ozone concentrations at p<0.05 (Figure 2a), 266 \nwith A. odoratum and A. capillaris showing strong trends towards the same effect 267 \n(p<0.1).  However, in year 2 the only species to show a significant increase in 268 \nsenescence in response to increasing background ozone concentrations was F. ovina 269 \n(p<0.01; Figure 2b).  Significant increases in senescence corresponding with 270 \nincreased peaks of ozone at harvest in year 1 were shown for P. erecta (p<0.01) and 271 \nF. ovina (p<0.05; Figure 2c).  Strong trends for increased senescence with increased 272 \npeaks of ozone in year 1 were also observed for C. echinata and A. odoratum (p<0.1).  273 \nAt harvest in year 2, the only species that showed a significant effect of increased 274 \npeaks of ozone was F. ovina (p<0.01; Figure 2d).  275 \n 276 \nIn year 1, the extent of senescence at harvest of both P. erecta and A. odoratum 277 \nshowed a significant interaction between increased background and peaks of ozone 278 \n(p<0.05 for both species (Table 2), with a greater increase in senescence than the sum 279 \nof effects of background and peaks individually.  In year 2, the only species to show 280 \nsuch an interaction was F. ovina (p<0.05), where the combination of increased 281 \nbackground and peak ozone concentrations again corresponded with a synergistic 282 \nincrease in senescence. 283 \n 284 \nThe difference in the extent of senescence between the \u201eHL\u201f and \u201eLL\u201f treatments for 285 \nF. ovina was larger in year 1 (19.1% and 8.5% respectively) than in year 2 (8.9% and 286 \n7.0% respectively).  This corresponded with a larger difference in mean ozone 287 \nconcentration between these treatments in year 1 than in year 2 (Table 1).   288 \n 289 \nThe AOT40 (calculated over 24 h per day) for the LH treatment and the HL 290 \ntreatments were similar in Year 1 (16.0 and 13.3 ppm.h respectively).  There were no 291 \nsignificant differences in the extent of senescence between these two treatments in 292 \nYear 1 for any of the species (data not presented).  Comparisons were not appropriate 293 \nin Year 2 because the difference in AOT40 between the two treatments was larger. 294 \n 295 \nRepeated measures analysis, comparing the rate of development of senescence to that 296 \nof the \u201eLL\u201f treatment for each species based on the time*treatment effect showed that 297 \nfor F. ovina there was accelerated senescence during the exposure period in year 1 for 298 \nthe HL (p<0.05), LH (p<0.05) and the HH (p<0.05) treatments (Figure 3).  In year 2 299 \nfor F. ovina there was a significant increase in the rate of development of senescence 300 \nin the HH treatment compared to LL only (p<0.05).  P. erecta showed accelerated 301 \nsenescence during the exposure period in year 1 for the HL (p<0.01), LH (p<0.05) 302 \nand the HH (p<0.05) treatments compared to the LL ozone treatment (Figure 3).  303 \nHowever, there were no significant differences in the rate of development of 304 \nsenescence in year 2 for this species.  For both F. ovina and P. erecta differences in 305 \nthe extent of senescence were first apparent after exposure to the ozone regime for 8 306 \nweeks (p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively).  Although some effects of elevated ozone 307 \nhad been shown in cumulative biomass for A. odoratum, no differences in the rate of 308 \ndevelopment of senescence were apparent in either year (Figure 3), although this may 309 \nhave been higher in the HH treatment in year 1.  There were no significant differences 310 \nin the rate of development of senescence in response to ozone in either year 1 or year 311 \n2 for the other species (data not presented). 312 \n 313 \nAlthough there was reduced senescence in the HH treatment in year 2 compared to 314 \nyear 1, the ozone concentrations and AOT40 in year 2 were also lower.  Regression 315 \nanalysis showed that there was no significant difference in the sensitivity to 316 \ncumulative ozone (AOT0 or AOT40) between the two years of study for any of the 317 \nspecies used.  Using the data for both years, the relationship between cumulative 318 \nozone (AOT0) and senescence showed linear relationships for F. ovina (r\n2\n=0.79, 319 \np<0.001), A. odoratum (r\n2\n=0.12, p=0.106), and P. erecta (r\n2\n=0.57, p=0.001), with 320 \nsimilar relationships using AOT40 (Figure 4).   321 \nSpecies abundance based on above-ground biomass 322 \nThe above-ground biomass of each species at each harvest, and the total harvested 323 \nbiomass are shown in Table 3.  There were no significant differences in the total 324 \nabove-ground biomass of the communities between the different treatments at harvest 325 \nin year 1, after overwintering or at harvest in year 2.  However, the total cumulative 326 \nabove-ground biomass showed a significant effect of increasing peaks of ozone 327 \n(p<0.05) and a significant interaction between increasing background and increasing 328 \npeaks (p<0.5), with a synergistic decrease in biomass.  These effects on total 329 \nharvested biomass corresponded with effects on the biomass of A. odoratum, which 330 \nhad the largest contribution to the total biomass of the communities.  A. odoratum had 331 \na total cumulative biomass which showed a significant effect of increasing peaks of 332 \nozone (p<0.05) and a significant interaction between increasing background and 333 \nincreasing peaks (p<0.05), corresponding with a further decrease in biomass 334 \namounting to 15% in the HH treatment compared to LL.  In addition to the decrease in 335 \nA. odoratum biomass, there was also a decrease in the grass:forb ratio with increasing 336 \nbackground (p<0.1 for year 1; p<0.05 using total cumulative biomass), but there was 337 \nno significant effect of increasing peak concentration on this ratio.   338 \n 339 \nSome differences in above-ground biomass were apparent for individual species.  F. 340 \novina showed significant reductions in biomass at the harvest after exposure to ozone 341 \nin year 1 due to both the influence of increased \u201ebackground\u201f (p<0.05) and \u201epeaks\u201f 342 \n(p<0.05) of ozone exposure.  There was no significant interaction between increased 343 \n\u201ebackground\u201f and increased \u201epeaks\u201f for this species.  The differences in biomass 344 \nbetween treatments for F. ovina did not persist for the duration of the experiment and 345 \nthere were no significant differences after over-wintering, at the final harvest or in 346 \ncumulative biomass. 347 \n 348 \nAfter overwintering, significant alterations in biomass due to the influence of 349 \nincreases in both \u201epeaks\u201f (p<0.05) and \u201ebackground\u201f (p<0.05) were shown for P. 350 \nerecta (Table 3).  Although these alterations in biomass were no longer evident after 351 \nexposure to ozone in Year 2 there was an effect on the cumulative biomass for this 352 \nspecies with a significant influence of increasing background (p<0.05) and a strong 353 \ntrend for an influence of peaks (p<0.1).   354 \n 355 \n4. Discussion 356 \nThe relationship between the extent of senescence with both AOT0 and AOT40 357 \nshowed no difference in the sensitivity of the communities to ozone between the two 358 \nyears detected, indicating that the plants responded to the ozone dose received in the 359 \ngrowing season with no carry-over effect or acclimation to ozone.  This is in contrast 360 \nto some other studies, such as Tonneijck et al. (2004), Barbo et al (1998) and 361 \nBungener et al (1999), which have all observed a decrease in response of perennial 362 \nplants over years in multi-year experiments, attributed to physiological or 363 \nmorphological adaptations that had occurred within the three years.  It has been 364 \nsuggested that the limitations for root growth during the second and subsequent years 365 \nof study may decrease sensitivity to ozone by reducing plant relative growth rates, as 366 \nhigher relative growth rates may be associated with ozone sensitivity (Bassin et al., 367 \n2007a).  However, it was not possible to determine whether the relative growth rates 368 \nof the communities changed between exposure seasons in this study, because the 369 \nharvested biomass at the end of the exposures was at different cutting heights in the 370 \ndifferent years.   371 \n 372 \nThe accelerated rates of senescence with increasing ozone treatment usually did not 373 \ncorrespond to reductions in biomass during the exposure period within an individual 374 \ngrowing season.  The exception was F. ovina, which showed reductions in biomass in 375 \nyear 1 only.  Senescence was also more frequently detected than changes in biomass 376 \nin species from wetlands (Franzaring et al., 2000) and from upland grasslands (Hayes 377 \net al., 2006).  Similarly, visible injury in the absence of biomass changes has 378 \nfrequently been demonstrated (e.g. Pleijel and Danielsson, 1997).  However, although 379 \nnot always considered to be an ecological impact on plants, premature and enhanced 380 \nsenescence could be detrimental because this would mean reduced assimilation of 381 \nresources in a growing season, resulting in a more gradual reduction in the overall 382 \nability of a plant species to survive and withstand other stresses.   383 \n 384 \nSmall increases in background ozone concentration in the absence of any peaks of 385 \nozone, from pre-industrial to current levels, were sufficient to induce a significant 386 \nincrease in senescence of F. ovina.  The effect was larger at the higher ozone 387 \nconcentrations used in year 1 (backgrounds of 20.3 and 48.7 ppb for LL and HL 388 \nrespectively) compared to those of year 2 (background concentration of 17.2 ppb and 389 \n37.1 ppb for LL and HL respectively). Other species such as C. echinata and P. erecta 390 \nwere less sensitive to the small increase in background during year 2, but did show 391 \nenhanced senescence in the larger concentration range used in year 1.  There was also 392 \na linear response of increasing senescence with increasing ozone exposure (AOT0 and 393 \nAOT40), indicating that there was no threshold for response in the species studied.  394 \nIncreasing background ozone in the absence of peaks has also been demonstrated to 395 \naccelerate senescence in A. odoratum (Dawnay and Mills, 2009).  The current study 396 \nand that of Dawnay and Mills (2009) both show effects that are at relatively low 397 \nozone concentrations that are within the range already experienced within upland 398 \nareas of Europe.   399 \n 400 \nEffects of ozone on the competitive balance of this community were small despite the 401 \nreduction in total biomass.  There was a decrease in cumulative above-ground 402 \nbiomass with increased background ozone concentration for A. odoratum, with 403 \ndecreased biomass of similar magnitude in the highest ozone treatments observed 404 \nthroughout the study for this species which only reached significance by the end of 405 \nthe second exposure.  This decrease in A. odoratum biomass contributed to a 406 \nreduction in grass:forb ratio.  Previous studies have demonstrated an increase in the 407 \ngrass:forb ratio with ozone exposure (e.g. Wilbourn et al., 1995) however, this is 408 \ndependant on the relative sensitivity to ozone of the species involved.  A. odoratum 409 \nhas been shown to be more sensitive to ozone than some other grasses such as Lolium 410 \nperenne (Hayes et al., 2007b), which was frequently used in the earlier studies.     411 \n 412 \nThe responses of the species to ozone when grown as a community were not as large 413 \nas expected based on their responses when they were grown and exposed to ozone as 414 \nindividual plants in a previous study, where widespread visible injury was observed 415 \non C. echinata and P. erecta when the plants were grown individually (Hayes et al., 416 \n2006).  Reductions in ozone concentration of up to 30% have been demonstrated 417 \nwithin a grassland canopy (e.g. J\u00e4ggi et al., 2006).  Together with increased boundary 418 \nlayer thickness due to reduced windspeed within a canopy this could combine to give 419 \nlower uptake of ozone into the plants when grown as part of a community rather than 420 \nas individuals, particularly for species such as P. erecta, which were protected by 421 \nother taller vegetation.   422 \n 423 \nThe contrasting ozone profiles with similar AOT40 during Year 1 of this study 424 \nindicate that an increase in background ozone concentration, such as that predicted 425 \nfrom increased hemispheric ozone concentrations, is as damaging to plants as an 426 \nepisodic profile from regional ozone pollution.  Similar increases in senescence 427 \ncompared to the lowest ozone treatment were found for both F. ovina and P. erecta.  428 \nThis is in agreement with a previous study using mixtures of L. perenne and Trifolium 429 \nrepens, which indicated that clover yield was similar with an episodic profile 430 \ncompared to a fairly constant ozone exposure with a similar AOT40 (Nussbaum et al., 431 \n1995), although in this case the total forage yield was more affected by the episodic 432 \ntreatment. 433 \n 434 \nThe largest effects on both senescence and biomass were found with a combination of 435 \nincreased peaks and increased background ozone concentration simulating that 436 \npredicted for future decades.  In some cases a synergistic effect of increased 437 \nbackground with increased peaks of ozone was apparent, including for total biomass.  438 \nPreviously critical levels for ozone have been based on data obtained using episodic 439 \nozone treatments (LRTAP Convention, 2004).  AOT40 (the sum of the differences 440 \nbetween the hourly mean ozone concentration (in ppb) and 40 ppb for each hour when 441 \nthe concentration exceeds 40 ppb, accumulated during daylight hours) has been used 442 \nto establish critical levels for ozone (LRTAP Convention, 2004, 2006).  However, 443 \nsmall changes in background ozone concentration around the 40 ppb threshold would 444 \nhave a large influence on the cumulative AOT40, therefore this index may not be 445 \nappropriate for regions where the background is already at or close to 40 ppb and is 446 \nlikely to increase in the future.  The predicted decrease in peak height during ozone 447 \nepisodes over recent years (NEGTAP, 2001) coupled with the predicted rise in 448 \nbackground ambient ozone levels over the next 50 years suggests that data from 449 \nexperiments such as that described here would need to be taken into account in future 450 \nrevisions of the critical level. 451 \n 452 \n5. Conclusions 453 \nThe ozone treatments used in this study simulated changes in background ozone that 454 \nmay occur in future decades, with or without modest peaks of ozone that were well 455 \nwithin the current normal ambient range.  The effects of these treatments on the seven 456 \nspecies within the simulated communities were mixed and were species-dependant, 457 \nmaking generalisations difficult.  Significant effects were observed on both the 458 \ngrasses and the forbs and occurred in response to increased background and\/or peaks 459 \nof ozone.  Increased senescence of F. ovina and P. erecta was observed when the 460 \nbackground ozone concentrations were increased in the absence of any additional 461 \npeaks of ozone.  These effects were also seen when the background ozone 462 \nconcentrations were raised in addition to peaks of ozone.  Overall, the species used 463 \nshowed no acclimation to ozone and the same relationship between senescence and 464 \nozone dose occurred in the second year as the first year of this study.   465 \n 466 \nIn this community, A. odoratum was most affected in terms of above-ground biomass, 467 \nbut other species such as F. ovina showed transient significant differences between 468 \nozone treatments.  It is likely that effects on biomass were occurring more slowly due 469 \nto a gradual reduction in overall plant vitality.  This study highlights the need for 470 \nlong-term experiments to study the effects of ozone on plant communities, because 471 \nsome of the significant effects were not observed until after exposure to ozone in the 472 \nsecond year.   473 \n 474 \nAcknowledgements 475 \nWe would like to thank the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 476 \nfor funding this work.
