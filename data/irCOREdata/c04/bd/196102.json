The \nexception was the DB[a,l]P dihydrodiol epoxide adduct of 2\u2032-deoxyadenosine which \nresulted in major product ions derived from the PAH moiety being detected. Specific \ndetection of mixtures of PAH adducted 2\u2032 -deoxynucleosides was achieved using \nonline column-switching LC-MS\/MS in conjunction with selected reaction \nmonitoring (SRM) of the [M+H]+ to [M+H-116]+ transition plus product ions derived \nfrom the PAH moiety for improved sensitivity of detection and a comparison was \nmade to detection by constant neutral loss scanning. In conclusion different PAH \nDNA adducts were detected by employing SRM [M+H-116]+ transitions or constant \n 5 \nneutral loss scanning. However for improved sensitivity of detection optimised SRM \ntransitions relating to the PAH moiety product ions are required for certain PAH DNA \nadducts for the development of targeted DNA adductomic methods. \n \n 6 \nIntroduction \nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent a group of structurally related \norganic compounds, formed primarily by the incomplete combustion of organic \nmatter, which are ubiquitously occuring environmental contaminants 1-6. \nBenzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) has been extensively used as a model compound for studying \nthe mechanism of biological action and assessment of exposure to PAHs 7. However \nhuman exposure to PAHs is not confined to a single compound but instead occurs as \ncomplex mixtures of different PAHs 4. Examples of human sources of exposure to \nPAHs include industrial or urban air pollution, automobile exhaust emissions, tobacco \nsmoke, coal tar, as well as charred or grilled food and cereals 2, 3, 8. Experimental \nanimal studies have demonstrated the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of a \nnumber of different PAHs and also provided evidence for differences in their \ncarcinogenic potency 9-11. The tumour initiating activity of PAHs is related to their \nability to form DNA adducts following metabolic activation to reactive intermediates. \nOne activation pathway is mediated by the combined action of the cytochrome P450 \nenzymes, predominantly CYP 1A1 and CYP 1B1with microsomal epoxide hydrolase \n(EHPX1) which results in the formation of the ultimate electrophilic reactive species, \na PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide. 12 This can react with the exocyclic amino groups of \nguanine (N2) adenine (N6) and cytosine (N4) in DNA (Figure 1) 13-15. In addition \nplanar PAHs can cause induction of P450 enzymes by binding the cytosolic aryl \nhydrocarbon receptor. This complex dimerises with the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear \ntranslocator, which on entering the nucleus binds to xenobiotic response elements \nupstream of cytochrome P450 genes resulting in their transcription. 16 The interaction \nof different PAHs may lead to additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects, resulting in \nchanges in processes such as metabolism and DNA repair with the consequence of an \n 7 \naltered carcinogenic outcome when compared to exposure to a single PAH. 17-22 \nFurthermore weakly or non-carcinogenic PAHs present in mixtures can alter the DNA \nadduct formation activity of a single PAH in animals. 23 The simultaneous \ndetermination of multiple PAH DNA adducts via a targeted DNA adductomics \napproach would allow for the profiling and assessment of exposure to mixtures of \nPAHs and potentially provide insight into the mechanism of cancer induction. \nThe 32P postlabelling method has been the most widely used method for the detection \nof PAH DNA adducts in animal and human tissues offering the advantage that only \nsmall amounts of the DNA sample are required for analysis and also that it allows \nmultiple adducts to be detected 24-26. For human DNA analysis, mixtures of adducts \nare detected as a \u201cdiagonal radioactive zone\u201d which represents a smear of \nradioactivity on thin layer chromatography plates. 27 Immunological methods \nemploying antibodies recognising PAH DNA adducts, in combination with \nfluorescence or chemiluminescence as well as immunohistochemical detection, have \nalso been used for the screening of PAH DNA adducts in human tissues 5, 26, 28, 29. The \nmain disadvantage of these methods is that they lack specificity. Due to sufficient \ngains in sensitivity from the advancement of instrumentation, liquid chromatography \n(LC)-electrospray ionisation (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS) now represents a viable \nalternative method for the detection of DNA adducts, with the advantage of providing \nstructural information of the adduct under investigation 30. LC-tandem mass \nspectrometry (MS\/MS) methods using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) have been \ndescribed for the detection of B[a]P derived DNA adducts in in vitro treated human \ncells, mouse liver and human lung tissues with accurate quantitation achieved using \nstable isotope internal standards 31-35. From numerous publications it is evident that \nthe majority of adducted 2\u2032 -deoxynucleosides show a common fragmentation in \n 8 \npositive ESI-MS\/MS, this being the neutral loss of 116 u following collision induced \ndissociation (CID), which corresponds to the loss of the 2\u2032 -deoxyribose 30. Selective \ndetection of these adducted 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides may be achieved by SRM of the \n[M+H]+ to [M+H-116]+ transition. The potential of using mass spectrometry for the \nscreening of DNA adducts by monitoring a large range of such transitions has \nrecently been exploited by Kanaly et al. allowing the detection of multiple DNA \nadducts simultaneously. This has led to the concept of producing an adductome map \nof all DNA adducts in a sample. This approach holds great potential for gaining \nfurther insight into DNA adduct profile differences between human populations \nexposed to mixtures of environmental genotoxins 36-38. \nIn the present study we describe the development of a targeted DNA adductomic \napproach using an online column-switching LC-MS\/MS methodology for the \nassessment of exposure to mixtures of PAHs. For method development PAH modified \nDNA samples were obtained by the reaction of the dihydrodiol epoxide metabolites of \nB[a]P, benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F) dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P), and \ndibenz[a,h]anthracene (DB[a,h]A) with calf thymus DNA in vitro. \n \n \n \n 9 \nExperimental Procedures \nChemicals \n(\u00b1)-Anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (B[a]PDE) was purchased \nfrom the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard \nRepository (Midwest Research Institute, Kansas City, Missouri). (\u00b1)-Anti-\nbenzo[b]fluoranthene-9,10-dihydrodiol-11,12-epoxide (B[b]FDE) 39-43, (\u00b1)-anti-\ndibenzo[a,l]pyrene-11,12-dihydrodiol-13,14-epoxide (DB[a,l]PDE) 44 and (\u00b1)-anti-\ndibenz[a,h]anthracene-3,4-dihydrodiol-1,2-epoxide (DB[a,h]ADE) 40, 45, 46 were \nsynthesised according to methods described previously. Caution: PAH-dihydrodiol \nepoxides are mutagens and carcinogens. Protective clothing should be worn and \nappropriate safety procedures followed when working with these compounds. Calf \nthymus DNA, deoxyribonuclease I (from bovine pancreas), snake venom \nphosphodiesterase I (from Crotalus adamanteus), alkaline phosphatase (from E.coli) \nand mass spectrometry grade formic acid were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK). \nAll other reagents (analytical grade), tetrahydrofuran (extra dry) and HPLC grade \nacetonitrile were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK). HPLC grade \nwater, 18.2 M\u2126cm output quality was obtained from Maxima purification equipment \n(Elga, High Wycombe, UK). \n \n \nReaction of calf thymus DNA with different PAH-dihydrodiol epoxides \nTo four 25 mg aliquots of calf thymus DNA (1mg\/mL) dissolved in 0.1 M K3PO4 \nbuffer, pH 7.4 were added 1 mg\/mL solutions of the individual anti-PAH-dihydrodiol \nepoxides dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, B[a]PDE (5.0 mL), B[b]FDE (1.0 mL), \nDB[a,l]PDE (1.0 mL) and DB[a,h]ADE (1.0 mL). The DNA solutions were incubated \n 10 \nat 37 \u00b0C in the dark for 24 h and then extracted 8 times with equal volumes of water-\nsaturated diethyl ether followed by 4 times with water-saturated isoamyl alcohol. The \nadducted calf thymus DNA was precipitated by the addition of 0.8 volumes of ice-\ncold isopropanol. Following mixing by inversion the DNA was pelleted by \ncentrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded and the DNA \npellet was washed with 5.0 mL of ethanol followed by 5.0 mL ethanol\/HPLC grade \nwater (70:30, v\/v) and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at each washing step. The \npellet was air dried and dissolved in 40.0 mL of HPLC grade water. The concentration \nof each PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide adducted calf thymus DNA sample was calculated \nby determining the absorbance at 260 nm (GeneQuant spectrophotometer, Biochrom, \nCambridge, UK) and assuming that one absorbance unit equals 50 \u00b5g\/mL for double \nstranded DNA. The samples were stored at -20\u00baC. \n \nEnzymatic hydrolysis of in vitro modified DNA for LC-ESI-MS\/MS analysis \nEach of the in vitro modified DNA samples (1.0 mg) was dried down using a \ncentrifugal vacuum evaporator. The dried DNA samples were dissolved in 990 \u00b5L of \n50 mM BisTris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.1 buffer plus 10 \u00b5L of 1 M MgCl2 and \nincubated with 100 \u00b5L of deoxyribonuclease I (2 mg\/mL dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl, \n10 mM MgCl2) at 37\u00baC for 6 h. The samples were further incubated with 60 \u00b5L of \nsnake venom phosphodiesterase I from Crotalus adamanteus (0.001 U\/\u00b5L dissolved \nin 0.11 M Tris-HCl, 0.11 M NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, pH 8.9) and 26.2 \u00b5L of alkaline \nphosphatase from E. coli (0.305 U\/\u00b5L) at 37\u00baC for 15 h. The hydrolysed DNA \nsamples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were transferred \nto new tubes and evaporated to dryness using a centrifugal vacuum evaporator (Speed \nvac plus SC210A, Savant, Farmingdale, US). The dried samples were dissolved in 1.0 \n 11 \nmL of HPLC grade water\/methanol (80:20, v\/v) to give a 1 \u03bcg\/\u03bcL final concentration \nof hydrolysed DNA. \n \nPreparation of PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide modified DNA mixture \nThe hydrolysed B[a]PDE modified calf thymus DNA sample (1 \u03bcg\/\u03bcL) was diluted \n1:5 with hydrolysed control calf thymus DNA (1 \u03bcg\/\u03bcL). The four different \nhydrolysed PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide modified calf thymus DNA samples (100 \u03bcg of \neach) were combined and following the addition of the [15N5]B[a]PDE-N2-dG internal \nstandard (10 pmol) were evaporated to dryness. The dried sample was dissolved in \n100 \u03bcL of HPLC grade water\/methanol (80:20, v\/v) to give a solution of 1 \u03bcg\/\u03bcL \nconcentration for each hydrolysed PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide modified DNA. \n \nDetermination of PAHDE-dN LC-MS\/MS CID product ion spectra \nThe LC-MS\/MS consisted of a Waters Alliance 2695 separations module with a 100 \n\u00b5L injection loop connected to a Micromass Quattro Ultima Pt. (Micromass, Waters \nLtd., Manchester, UK) tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray \ninterface. The temperature of the electrospray source was maintained at 110\u00b0C and the \ndesolvation temperature at 350\u00b0C. Nitrogen was used as the desolvation gas (650 L\/h) \nand the cone gas was set to zero. The capillary voltage was set at 3.20 kV. The cone \nand RF1 lens voltages were 42 V and 25 V, respectively. \nThe mass spectrometer was tuned by using a 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (10 pmol\/\u00b5L) \nstandard solution dissolved in 0.1% formic acid\/acetonitrile (70:30, v\/v) introduced by \ncontinuous infusion at a flow rate of 10 \u00b5L\/min with a Harvard model 22 syringe \npump (Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Edenbridge, UK). \n 12 \nAn aliquot of each enzymatically hydrolysed PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide modified calf \nthymus DNA sample was injected onto a Synergi Fusion-RP 80A C18, 4 \u00b5m, 30 \u00d7 2.0 \nmm column attached to a KrudKatcher disposable pre-column (0.5 \u00b5m) filter \n(Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK). The column was eluted using a gradient with \nsolvent A, 0.1% formic acid and solvent B, acetonitrile at a flow rate of 120 \u00b5L\/min. \nThe following gradient was used: 0 min\u201315%B, 10 min\u201315%B, 20 min\u201335%B, 30 \nmin\u201335%B, 30.1 min\u2013100%B (200 \u00b5L\/min), 35 min\u2013100%B (200 \u00b5L\/min), 35.1 \nmin\u201315%B and 45 min\u201315%B. The collision gas was argon (indicated cell pressure \n2.0 \u00d7 10-3 mbar) and the collision energy set at 12 eV. The scan time was set to 0.5 s \nand the resolution was one or two m\/z units at peak base. LC-MS\/MS product ion \nspectra were obtained in positive electrospray ionisation mode MS\/MS CID for the \nmolecule ion [M+H]+ for each PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide-2\u2032-deoxynucleoside \n(PAHDE-dN): B[b]FDE-N2-dG (C30H27N5O7) m\/z 570.2; B[b]FDE-N6-dA \n(C30H27N5O6) m\/z 554.2; B[b]FDE-N4-dC (C29H27N3O7) m\/z 530.2; DB[a,l]PDE-N2-\ndG (C34H29N5O7) m\/z 620.2; DB[a,l]PDE-N6-dA (C34H29N5O6) m\/z 604.2; \nDB[a,l]PDE-N4-dC (C33H29N3O7) m\/z 580.2; DB[a,h]ADE-N2-dG (C32H29N5O7) m\/z \n596.2; DB[a,h]ADE-N6-dA (C32H29N5O6) m\/z 580.2; DB[a,h]ADE-N4-dC \n(C31H29N3O7) m\/z 556.2; B[a]PDE-N2-dG (C30H27N5O7) m\/z 570.2; B[a]PDE-N6-dA \n(C30H27N5O6) m\/z 554.2; B[a]PDE-N4-dC (C29H27N3O7) m\/z 530.2. The mass spectral \ndata were acquired in continuum mode over a period of 20 to 30 min and processed \nusing MassLynx version 4.1 (Micromass, Waters Ltd.). \n \n 13 \nDetermination of PAHDE-dN adducts using online column-switching LC-\nMS\/MS \nThe online column switching valve system consisted of an automated switching valve \n(motorised two-position six-port valve, Waters Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) connected to \npump A incorporating an autosampler (Waters Alliance 2695 separations module) and \nan isocratic pump B (Gynotek GmbH, Germering, Germany). Pump A was connected \nvia the switching valve to the trap column, Synergi Fusion-RP 80A C18, 4 \u00b5m, 30 \u00d7 \n2.0 mm column attached to a KrudKatcher disposable pre-column (0.5 \u00b5m) filter and \nPump B was connected via the switching valve to the analytical column, Synergi \nFusion-RP 80A C18 (4 \u00b5m, 250 \u00d7 2.0 mm) column attached to a Synergi Fusion-RP \n80A C18 (4 \u00b5m, 4.0 \u00d7 2.0 mm) guard column and KrudKatcher disposable pre-\ncolumn (0.5 \u00b5m) filter. The outlet of the analytical column was directly connected to \nthe mass spectrometer. The configuration of the online column switching valve \nsystem is summarised in Figure 2. \nSample loading: An aliquot of the PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide modified calf thymus \nDNA mixture (1 \u00b5g\/\u03bcL of hydrolysed DNA) containing 1 pmol of the \n[15N5]B[a]PDE-N2-dG stable isotope internal standard was injected onto the trap \ncolumn using pump A with the switching valve in position 1. The impurities on the \ntrap column were eluted to waste using a gradient with solvent A, 0.1% formic acid \nand solvent B, acetonitrile at a flow rate of 120 \u00b5L\/min. The following gradient was \nused: 0 min\u201315%B, 10 min\u201315%B, 20 min\u201328%B, 35 min\u201328%B, 35.1 min\u2013100%B \n(200 \u00b5L\/min), 40 min\u2013100%B (200 \u00b5L\/min), 40.1 min\u201315%B and 75 min\u201315%B. \nConcurrently isocratic flow at 120 \u00b5L\/min via the analytical column, which was \neluted with 0.1% formic acid\/acetonitrile (70:30, v\/v), was maintained to the mass \nspectrometer by means of pump B. \n 14 \nSample elution: At 22.0 min the switching valve was switched to position 2 allowing \nthe purified PAHDE-dN adducts to be back-flushed from the trap column onto the \nanalytical column and then subsequent elution into the mass spectrometer. The \nisocratic flow was maintained by pump B at flow rate of 120 \u00b5L\/min with 0.1% \nformic acid\/acetonitrile (70:30, v\/v) for 13.0 min. Concurrently the flow from pump A \nbypassed the trap column and was diverted directly to waste. At 35.0 min the \nswitching valve was switched back to position 1 and the configuration of the online \ncolumn switching system reverted back to initial conditions as described for the \nsample loading above. The total run time was 75 min. \nMass spectrometry: A Waters Micromass Quattro Ultima Pt tandem quadrupole mass \nspectrometer with an electrospray interface was used. The temperature of the \nelectrospray source was maintained at 110\u00baC and the desolvation temperature at \n350\u00baC. Nitrogen gas was used as the desolvation gas (650 L\/h) and the cone gas (25 \nL\/h). The capillary voltage was set at 3.20V. The cone and RF1 lens voltages were 42 \nV and 25 V, respectively. The collision gas was argon (indicated cell pressure 2.0 \u00d7 \n10-3 mbar) and the collision energy set at 12 eV. \n \nSRM analysis: The hydrolysed DNA samples were analysed in positive ESI-MS\/MS \nSRM mode for the [M+H]+ ion to base [B+H2]+ or PAH moiety fragment m\/z \ntransitions: B[b]FDE-N2-dG, 570 to 454; B[b]FDE-N6-dA, 554 to 438; B[b]FDE-N4-\ndC 530 to 414; DB[a,l]PDE-N2-dG, 620 to 504, 620 to 353; DB[a,l]PDE-N6-dA, 604 \nto 488, 604 to 335; DB[a,l]PDE-N4-dC, 580 to 464 , 580 to 353; DB[a,h]ADE-N2-dG, \n596 to 480; DB[a,h]ADE-N6-dA, 580 to 464; DB[a,h]ADE-N4-dC, 556 to 440; \nB[a]PDE-N2-dG, 570 to 454; B[a]PDE-N6-dA, 554 to 438, 554 to 285; B[a]PDE-N4-\n 15 \ndC, 530 to 414, 530 to 285; [15N5]B[a]PDE-N2-dG internal standard, 575 to 459. The \ndwell time was set to 100 ms and the resolution was two m\/z units at peak base. \n \nConstant neutral loss analysis: ESI-MS\/MS constant neutral loss (CNL) scanning \nwas performed from m\/z 500 to 650 monitoring the neutral loss of 116 u following \nCID. The scan time was set to 0.5 s and the resolution was two m\/z units at peak base. \nThe data were acquired in centroid mode. \n \nData analysis: Raw data files were transformed into netCDF files using the \nDatabridge utility within MassLynx (version 4.1). Peak picking and integration was \nperformed with XCMS software version 1.18.0. 47. Unless stated otherwise, default \nparameter settings were used. Peaks were extracted using the \u201cmatchedFilter\u201d method. \nFor CNL data the signal to noise ratio cut-off (snthresh) was 5, full width at half \nmaximum (fwhm) of matched filtration gaussian model peak was 35 s, step size for \nprofile generation (step) was 0.2 m\/z, number of merged steps prior to filtration \n(steps) was 5 and minimum m\/z difference for peaks with overlapping retention time \nwas 2. For SRM data the default settings were altered in the following parameters: \nsnthresh = 1.4, fwhm = 35, step = 1, steps = 1. All subsequent data processing steps \nwere the same for both data types. Peak grouping was performed with the bandwidth \n(bw) set so 30 s and the width of overlapping m\/z slices to 1 m\/z. Non-linear retention \ntime correction was performed using the following parameters: family = symmetric \nand span = 0.5. In a repeated peak grouping step the bandwidth was reduced to 10 s. \nThe resulting peak list was imported into Microsoft Office Excel. Peaks eluting with \nretention times earlier than 30 min and later than 65 min were excluded and the peak \nareas normalised to the signal of the [15N5]B[a]PDE-N2-dG internal standard before \n 16 \nbeing plotted as bubble charts. The x-axis represents the retention time and the y-axis \nrepresents the m\/z ratio for each PAH DNA adduct detected. The size of the bubble is \ndirectly proportional to the peak area for each adduct. \nFor comparison peak area integrations were also performed manually for CNL \nextracted ion chromatograms (m\/z window = 1 Da) or SRM transitions within the \nMassLynx chromatogram window using the mean smoothing method, window size \n(scans) set to \u00b1 3 and the number of smooths set to 2. \n \n \n \n 17 \nResults \nPAHDE-dN LC-MS\/MS CID product ion spectra \nThe calf thymus DNA samples treated separately with four different PAH-dihydrodiol \nepoxides, were enzymatically hydrolysed to 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides and subjected to \nanalysis using LC-ESI-MS\/MS CID for the predicted [M+H]+ molecular ion of the \nexocyclic amino group PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide adduct for each 2\u2032-deoxynucleoside. \nThe PAHDE-dN adducts eluted between 20 and 30 min following analysis by LC-\nESI-MS\/MS CID. The product ion spectra for each PAHDE-dN are shown in Figure \n3. The different PAHDE-dN exhibited a common CID fragmentation pathway. \nDistinct product ions resulting from the [M+H]+ precursor ions were observed for \neach PAHDE-dN corresponding to the PAH adducted base ([(PAHtriol+base)+H2]+) \nfollowing cleavage of the glycosidic bond and neutral loss of the 2\u2032-deoxyribose \ngroup. For the majority of the PAHDE-dN except for DB[a,l]PDE-N6-dA, the \n[(PAHtriol+base)+H2]+ product ion was one of the major ions detected. Product ions \ncorresponding to the loss of one H2O molecule from the [(PAHtriol+base)+H2]+ ion \nwere also observed. No product ions resulting from the neutral loss of 17 u \ncorresponding to \u2013NH3 were observed, thus confirming that PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide \nadduct formation for each 2\u2032-deoxynucleoside was by reaction with the exocyclic \u2013\nNH2 group at position N2 for guanine, N6 for adenine and N4 for cytosine. \nThe spectrum for each PAHDE-dN contained product ions derived from the PAH \nmoiety. Product ions corresponding to [PAHtriol]+ as well as a [PAHdiol]+ due to loss \nof H2O were observed. A product ion corresponding to the loss of CO from the \n[PAHdiol]+ ion was also observed. The relative intensity of these product ions to the \n[(PAHtriol+base)+H2]+ product ion was considerably higher for DB[a,l]PDE-N6-dA \nwhen compared to the other PAHDE-dN. All the spectra also contained product ions \n 18 \nthat corresponded to the unadducted base ([Base+H2]+) at m\/z 152 [guanine+H2]+, m\/z \n136 [adenine+H2]+, and m\/z 112 [cytosine+H2]+. The fragmentation pathway of the \ndifferent PAHDE-dN is summarised in Figure 4. \n \nOnline column-switching LC-MS\/MS analysis of PAHDE-dN adducts \nInitial experiments involved optimisation of the mobile phase conditions for the \nseparation of unmodified 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides from PAHDE-dN on the trap column. \nA gradient separation with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid and \nacetonitrile was found to give the optimal separation with the different PAHDE-dN \neluting between 24 to 32 min from the trap column. The online column-switching \nvalve system was configured as shown in Figure 2 and the valve was switched to \nposition 2 at 22 min following injection of the sample, which allowed for the \nunmodified 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides plus any other matrix impurities that may be present \nto be eluted to waste, while PAHDE-dN were back-flushed onto the analytical column \nfor analysis using the mass spectrometer. \nThe enzymatically hydrolysed PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide modified calf thymus DNA \nsamples were analysed using SRM with transitions derived from the LC-MS\/MS CID \nproduct ion spectra described above. Typical online column-switching LC-MS\/MS \nSRM ion chromatograms are shown in Figure 5. Multiple peaks corresponding to \nstructural stereoisomers were detected for each PAHDE-dN adduct since the calf \nthymus DNA was treated with racemic mixtures of PAH-dihydrodiol epoxides. No \nobservable peaks were detected in enzymatically hydrolysed control calf thymus \nDNA that was not exposed to any of the PAH-dihydrodiol epoxides. The relative \nproportion of PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide adducts formed with the different 2\u2032-\ndeoxynucleosides was estimated from the peak areas for each adduct. For B[b]FDE \n 19 \nadduct formation with dG (98.7%) > dC (0.8%) > dA (0.5%). For DB[a,l]PDE adduct \nformation with dG (66.0%) > dA (30.4%) > dC (3.7%). For DB[a,h]ADE adduct \nformation with dG (99.3%) > dA (0.6%) > dC (0.1%). For B[a]PDE adduct formation \nwith dG (99.4%) > dA (0.6%) > dC (0.07%). \n \nComparison of different mass spectrometric operating modes for the analysis of \nPAHDE-dN adduct mixtures \nIn order to compare different mass spectrometric operating modes the mixture of the \nenzymatically hydrolysed PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide modified calf thymus DNA \nsamples was analysed using optimised SRM transitions for the most abundant product \nions which included transitions relating to the product ions derived from the PAH \nmoiety (Figure 6A), SRM transitions resulting from the neutral loss of 116 u \ncorresponding to the loss of 2\u2032-deoxyribose (Figure 6B) and CNL scanning for the \nneutral loss of 116 u (Figure 6C). The data obtained were processed using automated \npeak picking and integration via XCMS software. The results were compared with \nmanual integration for validation. Both sets of peak integrations were comparable (not \nshown), therefore proving that the less time-consuming automated data handling is a \nviable method for DNA adductomic analyses. The mass spectrometer signal response \n(peak area) for each DNA adduct was corrected using a [15N5]B[a]PDE-N2-dG stable \nisotope internal standard which was previously synthesised. 33 Previous analysis of the \n[15N5]B[a]PDE-N2-dG standard using isocratic elution revealed the presence of two \nstereoisomer peaks. However the current gradient elution employed did not resolve \nthe two peaks and a single peak was observed. 33 The PAH DNA adduct analysis data \nwere visualised as an adductomic map where the x-axis represents the retention time \nand the y-axis represents the m\/z ratio for each PAH DNA adduct detected. The size \n 20 \nof the bubble on the map is directly proportional to the peak area for each adduct \ndetected which has been normalised to the peak area of the [15N5]B[a]PDE-N2-dG \nstable isotope internal standard. Comparison of the DNA adductomic map profiles of \nadducted 2\u2032-deoxynucleoside peaks detected using SRM transitions resulting from the \nneutral loss of 116 u (Figure 6B) and CNL (Figure 6C) showed the presence of \nadditional ions which were also undetected in SRM transitions optimised for the most \nabundant product ions (Figure 6A). The most prominent additional ion was detected \nat m\/z 640 (retention time 37.4 min, (labelled x)) following CNL analysis (Figure \n6C). The use of optimised SRM transitions for the most abundant product ions \nresulted in a greater signal response for the detection of DB[a,l]PDE-N6-dA and \nDB[a,l]PDE-N4-dC adducts when compared to detection using SRM transitions \nresulting from the neutral loss of 116 u and CNL (Figure 6A). \n 21 \nDiscussion \nHumans in the course of their everyday lives are exposed to mixtures of PAHs which \nmay interact with each other and ultimately lead to alterations in their individual \ncarcinogenic activity. The ability to simultaneously detect multiple PAH derived \nDNA adducts would allow for the improved assessment of exposure and potentially \noffer a mechanistic insight into the carcinogenic process following exposure to \nmixtures of PAHs. The importance of determining multiple PAH DNA adducts rather \nthan single adducts was highlighted by Beland et al. who reported that for mice fed a \ndiet containing coal tar, the B[a]PDE-N2-dG adduct determined by LC-M\/MS only \nrepresented a small proportion of the total adduct burden in lung DNA as determined \nby 32P postlabelling. A similar observation was made for the analysis of human lung \nDNA samples. For only 1 out of 26 DNA samples showing the presence of PAH \nDNA adducts as determined by 32P-postlabelling was the B[a]PDE-N2-dG adduct \ndetected by LC-MS\/MS, indicating that the other adducts are derived from different \nPAHs 31. These findings highlight the fact that humans are exposed to mixtures of \nPAHs. Therefore the development of a targeted DNA adductomic approach for the \nassessment of exposure to mixtures of PAHs would be highly advantageous. Kanaly \net al. have proposed a DNA adductome approach using a series of SRM transitions \ntotalling 374 for monitoring the neutral loss of 2\u2032-deoxyribose. The diverse structural \nnature of DNA adducts, ranging from small hydrophilic modifications such as 8-oxo-\n7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine adducts to larger (bulky) more hydrophobic PAH \nadducts, represents a chromatographic challenge for the adequate separation of such \nadducts in a single chromatography run. 36, 37 An improved approach would be to \ndevelop more focused methods for different chemical classes of DNA adducts \nproviding better chromatographic separation and sensitivity. Examples include \n 22 \nrecently developed LC-MS\/MS methods for the detection of different oxidative DNA \ndamage adducts and hydrophobic DNA adducts. 48-51 In the present study we \ninvestigated the use of online column-switching LC-MS\/MS methodology for the \ndetection of PAH derived DNA adducts which have characteristic highly hydrophobic \nproperties. \nInitial experiments focused on obtaining DNA adduct product ion spectra for calf \nthymus DNA samples reacted in vitro with the different anti-PAH-dihydrodiol \nepoxide metabolites of B[b]F, DB[a,l]P, DB[a,h]A and B[a]P. LC-ESI-MS\/MS CID \nanalysis was performed for the predicted [M+H]+ molecular ion of the exocyclic \namino group PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide adduct for each 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides \nfollowing enzymatic hydrolysis of the PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide modified DNA. The \nanti-PAH-dihydrodiol epoxide adducts of B[b]F, DB[a,l]P and DB[a,h]A and B[a]P \nshowed a common fragmentation with one of the major product ions detected \ncorresponding to the adducted base resulting from the cleavage of the glycosidic bond \nand the neutral loss of 2\u2032-deoxyribose. In contrast the DB[a,l]PDE-N6-dA adduct \nshowed a different fragmentation pattern with negligible formation of the adducted \nbase product ion. Instead ions corresponding to the PAH moiety dominated the \nproduct ion spectrum. This may be explained by differences in the structural \nconformation of DB[a,l]PDE adducts which are derived from a parent PAH that \ndemonstrates a considerable molecular distortion due to atomic overcrowding in the \nfjord region 52 \n \nThe data obtained from the product ion spectra were used to select specific SRM \ntransitions for the different PAHDE-dN adducts that in turn were used to develop an \nonline column-switching LC-MS\/MS for the analysis of an enzymatically hydrolysed \n 23 \nPAH-dihydrodiol epoxide modified DNA mixture. Online column-switching confers \nthe advantage that such an enzymatically hydrolysed DNA sample can be analysed \ndirectly by LC-MS\/MS without the requirement for off-line pre-purification of the \nDNA adduct from the unmodified 2\u2032 -deoxynucleosides as well as removing any other \nimpurities that may be present. The PAHDE-dN adducts are retained on the trap \ncolumn whilst unmodified 2\u2032 -deoxynucleosides and any hydrophilic adducted 2\u2032-\ndeoxynucleosides are eluted to waste, after which the switching valve diverts the flow \nfrom the trap column into the analytical column, which is connected to the mass \nspectrometer. This approach not only provides the advantage of increased sample \nthroughput but also a substantial reduction in matrix effects and concomitant \nionisation suppression. Matrix effects may arise by competition for charge, or \nincreased droplet viscosity and surface tension from high concentrations of co-eluting, \ninterfering compounds for the formation of gas phase ions in the electrospray source. \n53 In general, similar SRM results monitoring for [M+H-116]+ transitions were \nobtained when compared to CNL scanning for the neutral loss of the 2\u2032-deoxyribose. \nHowever, CNL afforded the detection of additional minor ions including a more \nprominent unidentified ion at m\/z 640. The identity of the majority of these extra ions \nmay be attributed to solvent adducts and not related to 13C isotope [M+1]+ ions, as the \nautomated peak picking software was set to exclude these peaks. Therefore careful \nattention is required for the interpretation of CNL data. The advantage of CNL is that \nit allows for the screening of unknown adducts. However, in the case of PAH DNA \nadducts this approach does not allow for the monitoring of all DNA adducts that are \nformed as exemplified by DB[a,l]PDE-N6-dA. Significant detection of DB[a,l]PDE-\nN6-dA was only possible using SRM transitions for the product ions derived from the \nPAH moiety which were the most abundant. It is generally found that anti-dihydrodiol \n 24 \nepoxides of planar PAHs such as benzo[a]anthracene and B[a]P react preferentially \nwith 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine 14, 54 whereas those derived from non-planar PAHs such as \nbenzo[c]phenanthrene and DB[a,l]P also react to a major extent with 2\u2032-\ndeoxyadenosine. 14, 55, 56 Accordingly, the major adduct observed for treatment of calf \nthymus DNA with the anti-dihydrodiol epoxides of the planar PAHs, B[b]F, \nDB[a,h]A and B[a]P was derived from the reaction with guanine. In contrast \ntreatment with DB[a,l]PDE resulted in significant formation of adenine adducts. More \nthan one peak was observed for each adduct which corresponded to different \ndiastereoisomers resulting from treatment of calf thymus DNA with racemic mixtures \nof PAH-dihydrodiol epoxides. 14, 56 The addition of the [15N5]B[a]PDE-N2-dG stable \nisotope internal standard allowed for the determination of the relative level of each \nDNA adduct and also correction of any variations of the mass spectrometer signal \nresponse between analyses. Ideally stable isotope internal standards are required for \neach adduct to allow accurate quantitation of the absolute levels of the different DNA \nadducts which is difficult to achieve given the multi-step routes quite often involved \nin their chemical syntheses and the resulting limited yields producing amounts being \ninadequate to permit application in routine analysis. A possible compromise would be \nto use three stable isotope labelled internal standards eluting at different sections of \nthe chromatographic run, thus accounting for regional differences in matrix effects \nalong the chromatogram. \n \nIt should be noted that the work presented here focuses on the formation of DNA \nadducts following metabolic activation of PAHs to dihydrodiol epoxides and reaction \nwith the exocyclic amino groups of different 2\u2032-deoxynucleosides. There is the \npossibility for other types of PAH DNA adducts to be formed via alternate metabolic \n 25 \npathways. For example, for B[a]P an alternate route for activation involves \nmetabolism by cytochrome P450 and\/or peroxidases that leads to the formation of \nradical cations following one electron oxidation. These can form adducts at the C-8 or \nN-7 positions of guanine as well as the N-3 or N-7 positions of adenine. These \nadducts are very unstable compared to those formed with the exocyclic amino group \nof guanine and adenine and are rapidly lost from the DNA by depurination. 57 Another \npathway involves dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (an aldo-keto reductase) which results \nin the oxidation of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol to a catechol. This catechol \nundergoes auto-oxidation to form a reactive o-quinone, benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-quinone, \nthat reacts with DNA to form both stable and depurinating adducts 58. Obviously the \ndepurinating adducts would not be detected by the current approach since it relies on \ncleavage of the glycosidic bond. However, we have obtained some preliminary \nproduct ion spectra showing that the reaction of benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-quinone with 2\u2032-\ndeoxyguanosine results in adducts having a major product ion corresponding to the \nadducted base formed by the neutral loss of 2\u2032-deoxyribose (Dr. Gon\u00e7alo Gamboa da \nCosta, National Center for Toxicological Research, Arkansas, US, personnel \ncommunication). Furthermore, consideration should be given to the complex chemical \nnature of environmental contaminants that also contain nitrated PAHs such as the \nnitroketone 3-nitrobenzanthrone, which is an extremely potent mutagen present in the \nexhaust of diesel engines and in airborne particulate matter. We have recently shown \nthat the 3-nitrobenzanthrone adducts of 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine generate major product \nions corresponding to the adducted base resulting from the neutral loss of 2\u2032-\ndeoxyribose and would be amenable to detection by the current approach. 59 \n \n 26 \nThe newly developed methodology will initially be applied to in vitro studies where \ncells will be dosed with mixtures of PAHs in the presence or absence of cancer \nchemopreventative agents. However, improvements in sensitivity of the online \ncolumn-switching LC-ESI-MS\/MS approach for the detection of PAH DNA adducts \nare required to make it applicable for analysis of environmentally exposed human \nsamples, where sample quantity is limited and total PAH adduct levels in white blood \ncell DNA have been reported to be as low as 1-36\/108 unmodified DNA bases using \nthe 32P postlabelling technique 5. Increased sensitivity can be obtained by the use of \ncapillary or nano LC coupled to micro- or nanoelectrospray ionisation mass \nspectrometry. The recently developed microfluidic based technique of LC\/chip-\nMS\/MS should allow for increased sensitivity. The LC\/chip methodology has been \napplied to the detection of 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine adducts formed by 4-aminobiphenyl \nwith a detection limit of 20 amol and requiring only 1.25 \u00b5g of DNA. 60 An \nalternative approach would be to utilise the new generation of high resolution mass \nspectrometers which can be operated in full scan mode, and therefore would not \nrequire MS\/MS optimisation for each DNA adduct and show comparable sensitivity \nto triple quadrupole instruments making them highly amenable for DNA adduct \nscreening. These instruments provide high mass accuracy coupled with very rapid \nscan times, offering the potential to perform non-targeted analysis without prior \nknowledge of the DNA adduct identity. 61, 62 \n \nIn conclusion different PAH DNA adducts can be detected by employing SRM \n[M+H-116]+ transitions or by CNL scanning. However optimised SRM transitions for \nthe PAH moiety product ion are required to detect certain PAH DNA adducts with \nsufficient sensitivity. For the development of DNA adductomic approaches, we \n 27 \npropose the use of optimised SRM transitions to achieve high sensitivity and PAH \nDNA adduct coverage. CNL should be incorporated into the method development to \nmap for unexpected product ions. An online column-switching LC-MS\/MS method \nfor the profiling of exposure to PAH mixtures has been developed. The \nimplementation of online column-switching and software-based peak picking and \nintegration makes the method suitable for high throughput analyses. The method will \nallow the assessment of additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects of mixtures of \ndifferent PAHs with regards to the formation of DNA adducts. \n \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgement.
