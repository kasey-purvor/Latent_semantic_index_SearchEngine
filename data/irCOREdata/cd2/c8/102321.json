The main difficulty in achieving\nNC-based lasing is the very efficient nonradiative Auger\nrecombination,5 so that laser operation is achieved so far\nonly with pulsed excitation.6 Strategies to improve the laser\nperformance are \u0001a\u0002 to increase the NC concentration in the\nactive layer,7 \u0001b\u0002 the use of high-finesse optical feedback\nstructures,6 and \u0001c\u0002 the optimization of the optical\nwaveguides. While the properties of optical waveguides con-\ntaining Si nanocrystals fabricated by implantation have been\nstudied in detail,8 for waveguides containing colloidal NCs\nonly the principal operation has been demonstrated.9 There-\nfore, here we present a systematic investigation of two-\ndimensional \u00012D\u0002 and one-dimensional \u00011D\u0002 waveguides\n\u0001WGs\u0002, optically activated by strongly luminescent colloidal\nCdTe NCs synthesized according to Ref. 10.

The\nwaveguides exhibit propagation loss coefficients less than\n1 cm\u22121, depending on the thickness of the WGs. The losses\nare only weakly dependent on the width of the 1D WGs and\nare determined by the surface roughness.

Redistribution subject toThe NC WGs are fabricated by controlled deposition of\nCdTe NC\/polymer films onto glass substrates by the layer-\nby-layer assembly method.11 This simple technique makes\nuse of the alternating adsorption of \u0001sub\u0002monolayers of op-\npositely charged molecules or nanoparticles. In particular, we\nuse positively charged poly\u0001diallyldimethylammonium chlo-\nride\u0002 \u0001PDDA\u0002 molecules in combination with negatively\nsurface-charged CdTe NCs, each provided in aqueous solu-\ntions with appropriately adjusted pH values. The total film\nthickness is controlled by the number of PDDA\/CdTe NC\nbilayers and by the deposition time for each monolayer. For\na film with 40 bilayers we obtain a typical thickness of\n170 nm. Since the effective thickness of a PDDA molecule\n\u0001approximately 1 nm\u0002 is several times smaller than that of\nthe used CdTe NCs with a diameter of 3.2 nm,12 we obtain\nexceptionally high NC concentrations close to 60% in vol-\nume as determined from the optical density of the films.\nBy the use of PDDA with high molecular weight \u0001Mr\n=500 000\u0002 very smooth and shiny film surfaces are obtained\nwith a roughness in the order of 4 nm, as demonstrated in\nFig. 1\u0001a\u0002 by the atomic force microscope \u0001AFM\u0002 line profiles\nof a CdTe\/PDDA film with 40 bilayers. For the 1D WGs, the\nNC\/polymer bilayer films are deposited on substrates, pat-\nterned with grooves with widths of 5, 10, 20, and 40 \u0001m and\na length of 2 cm. The 450 nm deep grooves are wet chemi-\ncally etched by making use of a 30 nm thick Cr layer as etch\nmask. The waveguiding properties of the NC\/polymer films\nare studied by propagation loss measurements using the NC\nluminescence. An Ar-ion laser operating at 514 nm is used to\nexcite the NCs from a direction perpendicular to the sample\nsurface, while the photoluminescence \u0001PL\u0002 emitted in lateral\ndirection is collected from the sample edge by a microscope\nobjective. For detection, a Si-diode array is used in combi-\nnation with a 1\/8 m spectrograph. The PL spectra are re-\ncorded as a function of the distance z, measured between the\nexcitation spot and the edge of the sample \u0003see inset in Fig.\n1\u0001c\u0002\u0004.\n\u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics0-1\n AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\n111120-2 Roither et al. Appl. Phys. Lett. 89, 111120 \u00022006\u0001In aqueous solution, the used CdTe NCs exhibit a single\nPL peak with a full width at half maximum \u0001FWHM\u0002 of\n36 nm. The PL peak is Stokes shifted in respect to the first\nexcitonic absorption peak by 30 nm. This large Stokes shift\nis essential for the propagation of the NC PL in the WGs,\nwhich is only possible within the transparent energy region\nof the NCs. As shown in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002, for the 2D WGs the PL\nspectra collected in lateral direction exhibit a strongly asym-\nmetric shape and a FWHM of 28 nm, which is reduced with\nrespect to that observed for the solution. The reason for these\nfacts is the efficient PL reabsorption at the high energy tail of\nthe PL spectrum. For the lower energy part of the PL spec-\ntrum, propagation of the PL emission is observed over rela-\ntively long distances. Figure 1\u0001c\u0002 shows the PL spectra for\nvarious distances z between excitation point and sample\nedge, revealing that increasing z results in a decrease of the\nPL intensity, regardless of the emission wavelength. There-\nfore, it is sufficient to examine the dependence of the peak\nintensity, as is given in Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002. There, the experimental\ndata are fitted by a function which is proportional to 1\/ze\u2212\u0002z\n\u0001dashed line\u0002. Here the factor 1 \/z accounts for the intensity\ndrop of a radial wave within a 2D slab. The exponentially\ndecaying part is ascribed to the losses in the WG. Here the\nloss coefficient \u0002 takes into account absorption within the\nslab as well as scattering at the surfaces. The scattering\nlosses are determined by the surface roughness of the film.\nFor the film consisting of 40 NC\/PDDA bilayers we find an\n\u0002 of 0.9 cm\u22121 so that these films are an appropriate material\nfor waveguiding devices with dimensions up to several\ncentimeters.\nFor most of such devices, waveguiding in one direction\nis required. Since structuring of NC\/PDDA films is not well\ndeveloped, we investigate the possibility to obtain 1D\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002 Line profile of a 40 bilayer thick layer-by-layer assembled CdTe\nNC\/PDDA film determined by atomic force microscopy. \u0001b\u0002 PL spectra and\n\u0001c\u0002 PL peak intensities of the two-dimensional nanocrystal waveguides col-\nlected in lateral direction for various propagation distances \u0001see inset\u0002.waveguiding in NC\/PDDA films deposited on patterned glass\nDownloaded 26 Feb 2008 to 131.227.178.92. Redistribution subject tosubstrates. As shown by the AFM images in Figs. 2\u0001a\u0002 and\n2\u0001b\u0002, this results in WG stripes with rather smooth edges.\nThe laser excitation in this case is performed through the\nsubstrate to excite the NCs only in the grooves. As sketched\nin the inset of Fig. 2\u0001d\u0002, the NCs on the ridges are masked by\nthe Cr layer which is used also as etch mask. The lumines-\ncence spectra observed for the NCs in the grooves \u0003Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002\u0004\nexhibit a very similar shape than those for the planar films.\nThe decay of the PL intensity with increasing z, however, is\nby far smaller as in the 2D case. This is shown in Fig. 2\u0001d\u0002,\nwhere the dependence of the peak PL intensities on z is com-\npared for the 1D and the 2D case. For the 1D, the decay can\nbe fitted by a single exponential, without the 1\/z prefactor,\nwhich we quote as an indication for a truly 1D waveguiding.\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the microscope image of the\nsample edge shown as inset in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002. There, the row of\nbright spots represents the well separated emission from the\nend faces of more than ten individual WGs.\nTo clarify the origin of the WG losses, we investigate 1D\nWGs with various layer thicknesses and widths. Reducing\nthe thickness from 40 to 10 NC\/PDDA bilayers results in an\nincrease of the loss coefficient by a factor of 2 \u0003see Figs. 3\u0001a\u0002\nand 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004. This is almost independent of the groove width,\nvaried between 5 and 40 \u0001m. Remarkably, for the 1D WGs,\nthe same loss coefficient is obtained as for the planar films.\nThus, the roughness of the grooves is negligible in compari-\nson with that of the NC\/PDDA surfaces. To support our con-\nclusions we have calculated the distribution of the electro-\nmagnetic fields in our WGs, modeled as stripes with\neffective refractive indices as determined from spectroscopic\nellipsometry. As shown in Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002, in such WGs with thick-\nnesses below 200 nm, a single optical mode is observed.\nWith reducing film thickness, the mode spreads more and\nmore out of the active layer, so that the contribution of the\nFIG. 2.

Phys. Lett. 89, 111120 \u00022006\u0001in agreement with our experimental findings. To quantify the\nlosses due to surface roughness we have performed finite\ndifference time domain simulations, assuming no absorption\nin the NC\/PDDA layer. The results of these simulations,\nshown in Fig. 3\u0001d\u0002, predict a cubic increase of \u0002 with in-\ncreasing surface roughness. For the surface roughness as de-\ntermined by the AFM line profile in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002, the simulation\ngives a value for \u0002 which is about half of the experimental\none. This small discrepancy indicates finite but small absor-\nbance of the guided light by the NCs and might also account\nfor thickness variations of the films, taking place on size\nscales larger than those typically probed by the AFM.\nOur WGs provide a high optical gain under intense ex-\ncitation, achieved by a frequency-doubled regenerative am-\nplified Ti:sapphire laser, giving 120 fs pulses at a wavelength\nof 390 nm.

Redistribution subject tofrom the sample edge is detected. The PL intensity is plotted\nin Fig. 3\u0001e\u0002 as function of the excitation stripe length \u0001l\u0002. It\nshows a linear increase up to 0.04 cm, abruptly followed by\nan exponential increase up to 0.05 cm. This typical behavior\nfor amplified spontaneous emission can be well fitted by the\nexpression I=Al+B\u0001egl\u22121\u0002 \/g,6 where A and B are fitting\nconstants and g is the biexciton modal gain. Above a stripe\nlength of 0.05 cm the curve levels off due to saturation\neffects.6 The fit results in a modal gain of the WG mode of\ng=230 cm\u22121. This value is indeed somewhat higher than\nobtained so far for films containing CdSe NCs,6 confirming\nthat the high NC content in our structures is suitable for the\ndevelopment of NC-based laser structures with improved\nthreshold powers.\nIn summary the high potential of layer-by-layer depos-\nited NC\/PDDA films for applications in optical devices is\ndemonstrated. In these films, deposited on planar as well as\non patterned glass substrates, two- and one-dimensional\nwaveguidings are observed with penetration length of several\ncentimeters. Under pulsed excitation a high optical gain is\nobtained as a result of the high NC concentration in the\nfilms, which is of special benefit for optical amplifiers and\nlasers.\nFinancial support from the Austrian Science Foundation\nFWF \u0001Project Nos.
