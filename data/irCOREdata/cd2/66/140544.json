The turbulent flame speed, ST, characterizes the mass rate of reactant \nconsumption per unit area of the flame surface and plays an important role in \nformulating predictive, reliable, and robust models of turbulent combustion for multi-\ndimensional simulations of flames.  Flame speed varies with reactant pressure and \ntemperature and can be measured by several different techniques.   \n \n2    Test Method \nOur measurements have been made with a tube-stabilized conical (Bunsen) flame, \nusing the angle method (ST=Usin( \/2), where U is the mean velocity of mixture at the \ntube outlet and  is the vertex angle of the mean flame region).  However the \ndetermination of ST is difficult as the flame front is oblique and the thickness of the \nflame brush increases with increasing distance from the stabilization region.  \nMost premixed turbulent flames of practical interest are within the flamelet regime. \nThin flamelets also mean that the flame zone is characterized by large density \ngradients. This offers high sensitivity to the application of light deflection techniques \nsuch as schlieren, deflection mapping and interferometry. A typical flamelet oriented \nparallel to the incident beam direction produces a density gradient orthogonal to beam \nand because schlieren is only sensitive to density gradients orthogonal to the beam, \nflamelets normal to the beam direction will be transparent.  \nFor the conical flame configuration, schlieren can outline the flame cone very \nclearly.\n1\n The schlieren method is simple and avoids some of the difficulties associated \nwith operation of the flame at elevated pressure, such as the pressure-broadening \neffects for flame brush thickness. Schlieren uses density gradient imaging with natural \nlight emission. The basic principle of the technique is the combination of the optical \nprojection of a flow perturbation with an indication of its light deflection. The method \ntranslates phase differences into visible-spectrum amplitude and colour differences. \nThe optics are relatively simple and do not require a high power laser source or very \nprecise alignment. Although it is a so-called \u201eline-of-sight integration\u201f technique, it \nhas been shown that with the selection of the proper flame configuration to take \nadvantage of the unique features of premixed flames, quantitative information can be \ndeduced from the schlieren images.\n2-3\n \nSeveral physical mechanisms can contribute to the dependence of the value of ST on \nthe choice of a flame surface and on the flame geometry, such as the unsteadiness of \nthe mean flame brush thickness, the changes of the normal convective mass flux \nacross the flame and the curvature of the mean flame brush.  Also, because \nexperimental determination of the turbulent burning velocity usually requires defining \na flame surface to represent the thick turbulent flame brush in addition to measuring \nthe mean velocity entering the flame, there exist uncertainties of determining the \nflame velocity.  \nThese measurement uncertainties are reduced by an average of a number of schlieren \nimages and carefully designed data processing.  \n \n   - 3 - \n3    The Schlieren System \nThe optical system was built around a folded-path arrangement using large spherical \nmirrors, diameter 305mm, to reduce distortion.  Images were generated using a Xenon \nflash lamp source (100hz repetition rate, 60W average input, 2.90us average flash \nduration) driven by a signal generator and CCD camera (1024 1260 resolution) to \ncapture the images.  Image files were dumped directly to a PC hard drive.  The \nwindow apertures were 100mm and the whole window area could be imaged.   \nEffects of flame radiation have been controlled using a filter in front of the camera \nlens and short camera shutter duration (1 ms). The original instantaneous images were \ntaken from the CCD, and averaged image was determined by an average of pixel data \ntaken from fifty images. A program was written to find the digital profile of flame \nfront mainly according to the brightness of the edge, assuming axisymmetry of the \nflame. In the program, the flame zone is firstly chosen from the averaged image, the \nthreshold value is determined considering the histogram and average pixel data for \neach scan line.  \n \n \n4 Data Processing \nFlow visualization can determine the flame front located at the sharp boundary \nbetween light and dark regions representing the maximum temperature gradient. \nGiven the regime of premixed turbulent combustion, it also marks the regions of \nunburned and burned gases.  \nFlow visualization has the advantages of showing the spatial realization of the \ndynamic evolution simultaneously; however it can only provide qualitative \nobservation. Fu.\n4\n proposed that the \u201cimage flow field\u201d of the schlieren images could \nrepresent the fluid flow field, and the velocity distribution could then be recovered \nusing image motion detection. This data processing method can both give \nvisualization and provide the prospects of the instantaneous measurement.  \nFor this processing method, instead of using schlieren image sequence, only one \ninstantaneous image was used to recover the velocity distribution: here one image is \nseparated into two consecutive ones according to odd and even lines, the velocity \ngradients (\ndy\ndv\ndx\ndv\ndy\ndu\ndx\ndu\n,,, ) are calculated to determine the flame front. Moreover \nthe combined gradient maps (CGM,\ndy\ndv\ndx\ndv\ndy\ndu\ndx\ndu\n) of flow is studied and \ncompared with the flame front. \n \n \n5    Case Study \nHere we selected three conditions of different pressures, both instantaneous and \naveraged schlieren images are shown with derived flame envelope over a range of \nconditions. In this study, averaged image is got from 50 instantaneous images. \n \n \n   - 4 - \n \n \n P \n(kPa) \nV  \n(m.s\n-1\n) \nu' \n(m.s\n-1\n) \nTu \n(%) \nSL \n(m.s\n-1\n) \nST \n(m.s\n-1\n) (mm)\n\u03b7 \n(mm) \nIt \n(mm) \nReT \n \nDa Ka \n \nCase1 100 4.32 0.2 4.89 0.3436 0.765 0.065 0.224 4.98 62.64 132 0.084 \nCase2 300 4.05 0.262 5.94 0.2833 1.47 0.034 0.135 18.42 703.5 586 0.063 \nCase3 700 7.4 0.363 4.69 0.1982 3.309 0.022 0.06 22.4 2665 556 0.134 \nTable 1 Test Conditions \nWhere: P = mixture pressure; V = nozzle velocity; u' = fluctuating velocity; Tu = turbulence intensity;  \nSL = laminar flame speed calculated from CHEMKIN; ST = measured turbulent flame velocity; \n = flame thickness  = (\u03bbu\/( uCpuSL) (for u: unburnt conditions); \u03b7 = Kolmogoroff scale  (It\/ReT\n3\/4\n);      \nIt = Integral length scale; ReT, = nozzle Reynolds N\no\n = (u'lt\/ \/SL); Da, Damk\u00f6hler N\no\n = (ltSL\/ \/u\u201f);  \nKa, Karlovitz N\no\n = (ReT\n-1\/2\n(u'\/SL)\n2\n) \n \n \n \nInstantaneous Image \n \nAveraged Image \nFrame 001 06 Oct 2005 Example: Simple XY Plot\n \nFlame Front \nCase 1 \n \n \nInstantaneous Image \n \nAveraged Image \nFrame 001 06 Oct 2005 Example: Simple XY Plot | Example: Simple XY Plot | Example: Simple XY Plot | Example: Simple XY Plot\n \nFlame Front \nCase 2 \n \n \nInstantaneous Image \n \nAveraged Image \nFrame 001 06 Oct 2005 Example: Simple XY Plot\n \nFlame Front \nCase 3 \nFig. 1 Schlieren Image Data Processing \n   - 5 - \n \ndx\ndu  \n \ndy\ndu  \n \ndx\ndv  \n \ndy\ndv  \n \ndy\ndv\ndx\ndv\ndy\ndu\ndx\ndu  \n \nSuperimposed CGM distribution field to the flame \nfront \nFig. 2 CGM distribution field for averaged image of Case 2 \n \n    \nFig. 3 Superimposed velocity distribution field to the instantaneous images of case 2 \n \n \nCase 1 \n \nCase 2 \n \nCase 3 \nFig. 4 Superimposed velocity distribution field to the averaged image \n   - 6 - \nAt elevated pressure, the flame brush became shorter and less well-defined, schlieren \nimages from the elevated pressure experiments illustrate the difficulty of data \nmanipulation to arrive at flame speed (as shown in Fig.1).  \n \nCGM data processing method is illustrated in Fig.2.  The fact that the CGM \ndistribution almost overlaps the digital profile drawn from digital image processing \nshows these two methods result the same flame front (as shown in Figs 3 & 4). \n \n \n6    Discussion and Conclusions \nFrom schlieren images, the authors can get the flame front, flame speed, velocity and \ncombined gradient distribution field. The instantaneous and average velocity \ndistributions show the fluctuation and statistic property of the flame, the authors can \neven estimate the velocity quantitatively with further calculation. The fact that the \nCGM distribution almost overlaps the digital profile drawn from digital image \nprocessing shows these two methods result the same flame front.  \n \nSchlieren method is very valuable study high pressure turbulent flames, it can supply \nmuch information including the flame front, flame speed and velocity distribution.  \n \n7    Acknowledgements \nThe flame speed work formed part of a European Commission Framework V project, \ncompleted under EC Contract No. ENK5-CT-2000-00060.
